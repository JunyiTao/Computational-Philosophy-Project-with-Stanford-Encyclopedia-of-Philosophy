    "preamble": "\n\nThe concept of coercion has two different faces,\ncorresponding to the two parties involved in its most ordinary cases.\nOn one face, it picks out a technique agents (coercers) can use to get\nother agents to do or not do something. On the other face, it picks\nout a kind of reason for why agents (coercees) sometimes do or refrain\nfrom doing something. Coercion is typically thought to carry with it\nseveral important implications, including that it diminishes the\ntargeted agent\u2019s freedom and responsibility, and that it is a\n(pro tanto) wrong and/or violation of right. Nonetheless, few\nbelieve that it is always unjustified, since it seems that no society\ncould function without some authorized uses of coercion. It helps keep\nthe bloody minded and recalcitrant from harming others, and seems also\nto be an indispensable technique in the rearing of children. A\nstate\u2019s legitimacy and sovereignty is sometimes thought to\ndepend on its ability to use coercion effectively and to monopolize\nits use within its territory against competitors, both internal and\nexternal.\n\nBecause of its usefulness and its sometimes devastating effects,\ncoercion is a matter of longstanding political and ethical concern.\nNonetheless, there has been little sustained scholarly attention to\nits nature until recently; historically, many seem to have been\nwilling to accept the concept of coercion as a primitive. Since the\n1970s, however, the nature and function of coercion has come in for\nsignificant philosophical discussion. Though the pace of study has\nslowed somewhat since 1990, the nature of coercion and its effects\nremains a matter of dispute.\n\nSometimes the term \u201ccoercion\u201d is used in popular speech\nwith a quite broad sense. For instance, one hears\n\u201ccoercion\u201d used to describe social pressures (e.g., the\nneed to conform to peer expectations or to placate one\u2019s\nparents); or the constraining or manipulative effects of advertising,\none\u2019s upbringing, or the structuring of society more generally\n(e.g., the necessity of participating in a capitalist economy). It is\nalso sometimes treated as a quite general concept encompassing almost\nany sort of interpersonal infringement on one\u2019s rights. Such\nuses are not wholly foreign to philosophical discussions (see, e.g.,\nRipstein 2004). Nonetheless, the following discussion will focus on a\nnarrower sense of the term more in line with its use by major\nhistorical philosophical writers and contemporary theorists alike.\nThis usage will rule out, by stipulation, such things as mere\ndisapproval, emotional manipulation, or wheedling. (What is\n\u201cruled in\u201d is subject to dispute, as is discussed below.)\nThis minimal setting of boundaries still leaves considerable room for\ndisagreement over how best to understand coercion\u2019s workings,\nits preconditions, and its effects.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. History\n\nHistorically, the use of coercion by powerful actors has been of great\nconcern to philosophers and legal theorists. Detailed attention to\nunderstanding the concept coercion, however, is a relatively\nrecent phenomenon. One effect of this discrepant attention is that it\nis sometimes difficult to determine what precise meaning earlier\nwriters intended in their discussions of \u201ccoercion,\u201d as\nwell as to decide whether \u201ccoercion\u201d captures something\ndifferent from or related to other frequently used terms, such as\nviolence, compulsion, punishment,\nforce, or interference. A brief survey of a few\nnotable thinkers suggests that coercion has commonly been understood\nas a use of a certain kind of power for the purpose of gaining\nadvantages over others (including self-protection), punishing\nnon-compliance with demands, and imposing one\u2019s will on the will\nof other agents. The kind of power needed for these functions is the\nsort that states and other forceful or violent agents possess. One of\nthe clearest, most important uses of coercion has been understood to\nbe the state\u2019s enforcement of law, either through direct uses of\nforce or through punishments meted out to lawbreakers. The\nstate\u2019s use of coercion is thought to be licensed in particular\nfor the sake of preventing private acts of violence or coercion, as\nwell as for punishing the failure to keep agreements. These public\nuses of coercion are thought justified because they make possible\nprivate cooperation and peaceable coexistence among people not linked\nby ties of affection or blood.\n1.2 Aquinas\n\nAlthough one could start earlier, Aquinas offers a picture of what\nmight be regarded as the traditional, canonical understanding of\ncoercion, its importance, and consequences. Discussion of coercion\n(sometimes also described as \u201ccompulsion\u201d) recurs in the\nSumma Theologica under several headings. In a discussion of\nnecessity and the will, he notes that when we speak of necessity, we\nmean \u201cthat which must be\u201d (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q6\nA6). There are various ways something may be necessary. Coercion, he\nsays, is a kind of necessity in which the activities of one agent\n\u2014 the coercer \u2014 make something necessary for another\nagent. The \u201cnecessity of coercion\u201d is that in which\n\u201ca thing must be, when someone is forced by some agent, so that\nhe is not able to do the contrary\u201d (ibid.). Such\nnecessity is \u201caltogether repugnant to the will,\u201d\n(ibid.) meaning that what is done because of coercion is not\ndone voluntarily. To say that something is voluntary, for Aquinas,\nimplies that it follows from or is in accord with one\u2019s\ninclinations; in contrast, coercion is linked with the notions of\nviolence and the involuntary.\n\nFor we call that violent which is against the inclination of a thing.\n\u2026 [A] thing is called voluntary because it is according to the\ninclination of the will. Therefore, just as it is impossible for a\nthing to be at the same time violent and natural, so it is impossible\nfor a thing to be absolutely coerced or violent, and voluntary\n(Aquinas, ST, I Q82 A1).\n\n\nFor Aquinas, the law and the government bear a special relationship to\nthe use of coercion/compulsion. In a discussion of the nature of\n(human) law, Aquinas claims that \u201cthe notion of law contains two\nthings: first, that it is a rule of human acts; secondly, that it has\ncoercive power\u201d (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q96 A5). This power\nis identified with the ability of rulers to use force and violence\nagainst their subjects: \u201cthe governor of a city has perfect\ncoercive power: wherefore he can inflict irreparable punishments such\nas death and mutilation\u201d (Aquinas ST, II.II Q65 A2).\nThe law, Aquinas suggests, must use \u201cforce and fear\u201d in\norder to restrain those who are \u201cfound to be depraved, and prone\nto vice, and not easily amenable to words,\u201d so that they will\n\u201cdesist from evil-doing, and leave others in peace,\u201d as\nwell as become \u201chabituated in this way,\u201d and\n\u201cvirtuous\u201d (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q95 A1). This power\nis not available for anyone to use: Aquinas argues that the coercive\nfunction should be \u201cvested in the whole people or in some public\npersonage,\u201d and not allowed to private parties (Aquinas,\nST, I.II Q90 A3). He does allow, however, that some parties,\nsuch as the head of a household (\u201can imperfect\ncommunity\u201d), must be able to use an \u201cimperfect coercive\npower, which is exercised by inflicting lesser punishments, for\ninstance by blows, which do not inflict irreparable harm\u201d\n(ibid.).\n\nAquinas also supports the common view that at least some coercion\naffects the coercee\u2019s responsibility or blameworthiness for what\nhe does as a result of coercion. He holds that one is not to be blamed\nfor things done non-voluntarily. Insofar as violence undercuts the\nvoluntariness of one\u2019s doings, as suggested above, one is not to\nbe blamed for them. Violence appears able to coerce in two ways: when\nused directly against one\u2019s body (\u201ca man may be dragged by\nforce: but it is contrary to the very notion of violence, that he be\ndragged of his own will\u201d (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q6 A4));\nand when used in a way that disables one\u2019s will (\u201cthe will\ncan suffer violence, in so far as violence can prevent the exterior\nmembers from executing the will\u2019s command\u201d (Aquinas,\nST, I.II Q6 A4)). Interestingly, however, the\n threat[1]\n of violence that causes one to act from fear, or to avoid that\nviolence, does not make an act involuntary, on Aquinas\u2019\nunderstanding. So only some uses of violence to hinder another\u2019s\nactions have the effect of exempting the person targeted from blame\nfor things done as a result of\n violence.[2]\n1.2 Hobbes, Locke, Kant\n\nThese three modern-era thinkers, though they differ in many ways, hold\nsurprisingly similar views of the nature of coercion and its role in\nthe function of justice and the state. Hobbes\u2019s fame as a\npolitical theorist derives at least in part from the central role he\ngives to coercion as a necessary part of a state\u2019s function.\nNoticing that many contracts require one party to perform one\u2019s\nobligations before the other party acts, Hobbes suggests that such\nfirst performance would be irrational if one had no means to secure\nthe subsequent performance of one\u2019s bargaining partner.\n\nFor he that performs first has no assurance the other will perform\nafter; because the bonds of words are too weak to bridle men\u2019s\nambition, avarice, anger, and other Passions, without the fear of some\ncoercive Power. \u2026 But in a civil estate, where there is a Power\nset up to constrain those that would otherwise violate their faith,\nthat fear is no more reasonable; and for that cause, he which by the\nCovenant is to perform first, is obliged so to do (Hobbes 1651,\nCh.14).\n\n\nInterestingly, Hobbes seems to share Aquinas\u2019 view that acting\nfrom fear does not undercut the voluntariness of one\u2019s acts, as\nhe famously asserts that \u201ccovenants extorted by fear are\nvalid\u201d (Hobbes 1651, Ch. 14).\n\nMore generally, the very possibility of establishing justice and\ninjustice depends on the possibility of coercing subjects to abide by\ntheir covenants.\n\n[W]here there is no coercive Power erected, that is, where there is no\nCommonwealth, there is no Propriety; all men having Right to all\nthings: Therefore where there is no Commonwealth, there nothing is\nUnjust. So that the nature of Justice, consists in keeping of valid\nCovenants: but the Validity of Covenants begins not but with the\nConstitution of a Civil Power, sufficient to compel men to keep them:\nAnd then it is also that Propriety begins (Hobbes 1651, Ch. 15).\n\n\nHobbes thus holds that coercion is essential to both the justification\nof and function of the state or commonwealth. In fact, it is a law of\nnature that we seek the protection of the Leviathan\u2019s coercive\npowers in order to exit the perilous conditions of the state of\nnature.\n\nLocke very rarely uses the term \u201ccoercion\u201d or its\n variants,[3]\n but he believes like Hobbes that the function of the state is\nintimately tied to its role in securing individuals against those who\nwould kill, injure or rob them.\n\nPolitical power, then, I take to be a right of making laws, with\npenalties of death, and consequently all less penalties for the\nregulating and preserving of property, and of employing the force of\nthe community in the execution of such laws, and in the defence of the\ncommonwealth from foreign injury, and all this only for the public\ngood (Locke 1823 [1689], Sec. 3).\n\n\nLocke, more so than Hobbes, is wary of the power of the sovereign, but\nis less anxious about conditions in the state of nature. One reason\nfor this reversal of concern, he suggests, is that sovereigns are more\npotent oppressors than ordinary inhabitants of the state of nature,\ndue to the ability of sovereigns to organize force and violence (Locke\n1823 [1689], Sec. 137).\n\nBecause individuals cannot reasonably give up power to an unchecked\nsovereign, Locke also holds that an agent\u2019s ability to possess\nand use that power effectively depends in many ways on the rightness\nof that agent\u2019s use of power. In particular, Locke seems to\nsuggest that a system of property rights cannot be enforced by the\nstate if it renders others unable to secure their own economic\nsurvival. One is entitled to the protection of what one has labored to\ncreate so long as, with respect to land and other natural resources,\n\u201cthere is enough, and as good, left in common for others\u201d\n(Locke 1823 [1689], Sec. 27). This \u201cLockean proviso,\u201d as\nNozick called it (Nozick 1974, p. 175 ff), creates a sort of\nbaseline condition against which the acceptability of any set of\ncoercive arrangements can be judged. So for Locke, more than for\nHobbes, the power of the sovereign rests on the consent of those\ngoverned \u2014 not only for its justification, but also for its\nstability against revolution, about which Locke was clearly more\nsanguine than Hobbes.\n\nKant also gives considerable attention to the importance of coercion\nfor guaranteeing rights of citizens, though he says little that would\nexplain what he means by his use of the term. Kant\u2019s only\nprominent discussion of coercion occurs in his Doctrine of\n Right,[4]\n a treatise on the nature of law. Kant thinks there are two sorts of\n\u201cincentives\u201d to follow the law: ethical and\njuridical. The ethical (i.e., rational) incentive to follow\nthe law is the motive of duty. But since the wills of some people are\ndetermined pathologically \u2014 that is, by inclinations and\naversions, rather than by duty \u2014 there needs also to be a way to\nget such persons to follow the law as well, through such means as\naversion to punishment (Kant 1996 [1797], 20 [AK 6, 219]). Coercion is\nthen a tool the law uses to get the lawless to respect the rights of\nothers whether they want to or not. He associates it with the\nexecutive authority of the state\u2019s ruler, and the ruler\u2019s\nuse of punishment in conformity with the law. Kant makes clear that\ncoercion counts as a hindrance to freedom, in which respect it is\nsimilar to all violations of a person\u2019s rights. But coercion can\nbe used to prevent other rights violations, and thus may be justified\non the grounds that it counts as a hindrance to a hindrance to\nfreedom. \u201cRight and authorization to use coercion therefore mean\none and the same thing\u201d (Kant 1996 [1797], 26 [AK 6, 232]).\n\nKant\u2019s views on the necessity of coercion for the existence of\nright differ from those of Hobbes and Locke, but he is in general\nsympathetic to the idea that states require the ability to use\ncoercion in defense of the equal freedom of their subjects. Without\nsuch coercive abilities, one can have \u201cprivate right,\u201d but\nthat is no more than the rights one has in the state of nature, which\nare by no means secure.\n\nIt is true that the state of nature need not, just because it is\nnatural, be a state of injustice, of dealing with one another\nonly in terms of the degree of force each has. But it would still be a\nstate devoid of justice \u2026 in which when rights are\nin dispute there would be no judge competent to render a\nverdict having rightful force. Hence each may impel the other by force\nto leave this state and enter into a rightful condition; \u2026\n[the] acquisition [of right] is still only provisional as\nlong as it does not yet have the sanction of public law, since it is\nnot determined by public (distributive) justice and secured by an\nauthority putting this right into effect (Kant 1996 [1797], 90 [AK 6,\n312]).\n\n\nSo Kant, like Hobbes and Locke, sees it as a necessity for people to\nestablish a state with coercive powers in order to achieve\njustice.\n1.3 John Stuart Mill\n\nWith respect to his thinking about coercion, Mill is most famous for\nhis views, in On Liberty, about what coercion is not fit to\ndo: namely, be used to regulate people\u2019s behavior for their own\ngood. Like his predecessors and mentor Jeremy Bentham, Mill associates\ncoercion with the state\u2019s powers to punish lawbreakers. But Mill\nseems in general to take a more expansive view of what coercion\namounts to than did those surveyed above, appearing to treat the terms\n\u201ccoercion\u201d and \u201cinterference\u201d as much the same\nthing in On Liberty. In stating the thesis of that work, Mill\nwrites,\n\nThe object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as\nentitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the\nindividual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means\nused be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral\ncoercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for\nwhich mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in\ninterfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is\nself-protection. \u2026 [An individual] cannot rightfully be\ncompelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so,\nbecause it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others,\nto do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for\nremonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or\nentreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any\nevil in case he do otherwise (Mill 1909\u201314 [1859], Ch.1).\n\n\nIn treating coercion expansively, Mill apparently intended to capture\na number of different ways in which powerful agents could exercise\nconstraining power on others besides the use of force, violence, and\nthreats thereof. So, for instance, Mill suggests that the potency of\nlegal penalties often resides more in the stigma they attach than the\nactual punishments they apply. Concerning laws against unpopular\nviews, Mill writes,\n\n[T]he chief mischief of the legal penalties is that they strengthen\nthe social stigma. It is that stigma which is really effective\u2026\n[Except for people who are] independent of the good will of other\npeople, opinion, on this subject, is as efficacious as law; men might\nas well be imprisoned, as excluded from the means of earning their\nbread.\u2026 Our merely social intolerance kills no one, roots out\nno opinions, but induces men to disguise them, or to abstain from any\nactive effort for their diffusion (Mill 1909\u201314 [1859], Ch. 2).\n\n\nThus Mill decries \u201cthe despotism of custom,\u201d as a force\nseemingly more potent than that of governments, in that it is able to\nhold back whole civilizations for centuries (Mill 1909\u201314\n[1859], Ch. 2).\n\nBy contrast with Hobbes, Locke, or Kant, Mill recognizes that the\npower of civil institutions is frequently on a par with the power of\nthe state, and treats the potential for coercion by these other\ninstitutions as similarly a matter of concern. For instance, in\nthinking about the institution of marriage, Mill writes,\n\nWhen the law makes everything which the wife acquires, the property of\nthe husband, while by compelling her to live with him it forces her to\nsubmit to almost any amount of moral and even physical tyranny which\nhe may choose to inflict, there is some ground for regarding every act\ndone by her as done under coercion (Mill 1909 [1848], Bk.V, ch. XI).\n\n\nAnd in looking at the circumstances of child labor in his day, he\nnoted,\n\nLabouring for too many hours in the day, or on work beyond their\nstrength, should not be permitted to [children], for if permitted it\nmay always be compelled. Freedom of contract, in the case of children,\nis but another word for freedom of coercion (Mill 1909 [1848], Bk. V.\nch. XI).\n\n\nThus Mill\u2019s understanding of coercion appears to treat a wider\narray of powers as potential means of coercion than did earlier\nthinkers.\n1.4 20th Century views to 1969\n\nWith the advent of analytic approaches to philosophy and law in the\n20th Century, philosophers and legal theorists began to give more\nexplicit elaboration to what \u201ccoercion\u201d means, and how it\nrelates to other concepts. In the period prior to 1969, there were of\ncourse some differences among theorists, but there seems to be a\nmainstream view of coercion that is more or less continuous with the\nview found in Aquinas and Hobbes/Locke/Kant (and some of the views of\nBentham and Mill). This view identifies coercion with the use of force\nor violence, as well as to threats of the same. For instance, Hans\nKelsen explains the nature of law by saying,\n\nAs a coercive order, the law is distinguished from other social\norders. The decisive criterion is the element of force \u2014 that\nmeans that the act prescribed by the order as a consequence of\nsocially detrimental facts ought to be executed even against the will\nof the individual and, if he resists, by physical force (Kelsen 1967\n[1934], 34).\n\n\nKelsen goes on to count as coercive acts such things as detaining\nthose suspected of crimes, detaining for protective custody, detaining\nof the insane, detaining in internment camps potential enemies of the\nstate, and the confiscation or destruction of property (Kelsen 1967\n[1934], 40\u201341).\n\nJ. R. Lucas puts a slightly different cast on a similar thought,\nemphasizing the importance of a technique by which one agent (e.g.,\nthe state) can assure that its decisions are implemented.\n\n[W]e are concerned with the enforcement of decisions: we are\nconsidering the conditions under which decisions will be carried out\nregardless of the recalcitrance of the bloody minded. We therefore\ndefine force in terms of bloody-mindedness, of what happens\nirrespective of how recalcitrant a man is, of what happens to him\nwilly-nilly. Force, then, we say, is being used against a man, if in\nhis private experience or in his environment either something is being\ndone which he does not want to be done but which he is unable to\nprevent in spite of all his efforts, or he is being prevented, in\nspite of all his efforts, from doing something which he wants to do,\nand which he otherwise could have done by himself alone. A man is\nbeing coerced when either force is being used against him or\nhis behaviour is being determined by the threat of force (Lucas 1966,\n57; emphasis in the original).\n\n\n[I]mprisonment is the paradigm form of coercion.\u2026 Even if it\nwere not regarded as a penalty, it would still be effective in\nfrustrating the efforts of the recalcitrant to prevent a judicial\ndecision being implemented (Lucas 1966, 60).\n\n\nIf there is a single, continuous thread that runs through the various\nthoughts about coercion surveyed above, I believe it could be\nidentified as Lucas suggests with a concern for the ability of some\nagents to implement and enforce decisions about the activities of\nothers. With the possible exception of Mill, who allows for a greater\nrange of coercive methods than the others surveyed, this general idea\nseems to capture what one might have said was essential in the concept\nof coercion as pre-modern and modern political theorists employed it,\nby name or (in the case of Locke) by function.\n\n2. Contemporary philosophical accounts of coercion\n2.1 Nozick and a new approach to coercion\n\nBeginning in 1969, a spate of short articles was published on\ncoercion. The earliest of significance was Robert Nozick\u2019s\n\u201cCoercion.\u201d It was followed shortly by a collection of\nessays by political philosophers published in a volume of the\nNomos series, focused on coercion (Pennock and Chapman 1972).\nThese articles were in turn followed by an outpouring of responses and\noriginal discussions of coercion that continued throughout the 1970s\nand 80s. The influence of these early discussions of coercion remains\nstrong. So it is useful to begin thinking about contemporary\ntreatments of coercion by looking at how these early articles framed\nthe topic.\n\nNozick\u2019s essay was by far the most influential of these early\nworks. Besides being first, his essay established a framework for\nthinking about coercion which provided an intuitively compelling\npicture of how coercion works. Nozick analyzed coercion by offering a\nlist of necessary and sufficient conditions for judging the truth of\nthe claim that P coerces Q. Somewhat simplified, he\nargued that P coerces Q if and only if:\n\nP aims to keep Q from choosing to perform action\nA;\nP communicates a claim to Q;\nP\u2019s claim indicates that if Q performs\nA, then P will bring about some consequence that\nwould make Q\u2019s A-ing less desirable to\nQ than Q\u2019s not A-ing;\nP\u2019s claim is credible to Q;\nQ does not do A;\nPart of Q\u2019s reason for not doing A is to\nlessen the likelihood that P will bring about the consequence\nannounced in (3) (Nozick 1969,\n 441\u2013445).[5]\n\n\nMany theorists adopted this framework explicitly or implicitly, and it\nhas influenced almost all subsequent analytic philosophical\ndiscussions of the topic. Subsequent sections will address the aspects\nof Nozick\u2019s analysis which have received the most attention and\ndebate. The remainder of this section sketches some of the less\nremarked ways in which Nozick\u2019s analysis differs from the more\ntraditional understanding of coercion, exhibited in the historical\nsurvey above. Specifically, (1) it associates coercion only with\nproposals (e.g., conditional\n threats[6]),\n and excludes direct uses of force or\n violence[7];\n (2) it insists that coercion takes place only when the coercee\nacquiesces to it; and (3) it makes coercion explicitly dependent on\nthe coercee\u2019s choice to take or not take a specific action\nA, and mandates that a judgment about coercion must refer to\nfacts about the coercee\u2019s psychology, such as her assessment of\nthe consequences A-ing in light of the coercer\u2019s\nproposal. The overall effect of these differences is to focus the\nanalysis of coercion on how the coercee is affected by it, rather than\non what the coercer does, and what is required for him to do it\nsuccessfully. (See Anderson 2008b.)\n2.1.1 Coercion via threats, and (not) via force\n\nOne significant departure from the traditional approach is that Nozick\nlimits his discussion of coercion to techniques that influence or\nalter the will of the coercee, by altering the intentions or\ndispositions of the coercee. Such coercion usually takes the form of a\nconditional threat (or sometimes a conditional offer). Though a few\nsubsequent writers, like Michael Bayles (Bayles 1972; and Gunderson\n1979, following Bayles) and Grant Lamond (Lamond 1996 and 2000), have\naccepted direct force as equally a means of\n coercion,[8]\n Nozick\u2019s restriction of the topic to the use of threats \u2014\nthat is, coercion that operates through the will of the coercee\n\u2014 has been the much more frequently accepted view, whether\nexplicitly or implicitly.\n\nHowever, some theorists argue that there are good reasons to treat\ncoercion via the will and direct force or constraint applied to the\nbody as two methods of a single kind of activity. First, though direct\nforce is usually unsuited to get an agent to perform a specific\naction, both are well suited to preventing an agent from taking a\nvariety of actions, with direct force or constraint often being more\ndecisive. Second, the two techniques are often used hand-in-hand. For\ninstance, police officers will shackle and manhandle someone in\ncustody who refuses to cooperate when given instructions to move or\nstay still. Also, prison inmates are coerced into remaining there by a\ncombination of penalties for attempting escape along with physical\nobstacles that limit the feasibility of doing so. So using both\ntechniques is often part of one and the same activity aimed at\naffecting or constraining what an agent will do (sometimes by\naffecting what she can do) (Anderson 2008a and 2010). Of\ncourse, under direct force, it will usually be true that the coercee\ndoes not act, but rather is acted upon, as H. J. McCloskey puts it\n(McCloskey 1980). However, from the coercer\u2019s perspective, it\nmay be just as well, in enforcing his decisions, to prevent the\ncoercee from acting at all as it would be to induce her to choose not\nto act.\n2.1.2 (No) unsuccessful coercion\n\nNozick\u2019s framing indicates that coercion is necessarily\nsuccessful: if the coercee does not act as demanded, then there is no\ninstance of coercion. At most, it seems, there is an instance of\nattempted coercion. One might say that Nozick builds a \u201csuccess\ncondition\u201d into his analysis of coercion. Others have disagreed\nwith the success condition, though Nozick\u2019s is apparently a\nmajority view. (Those who agree include McCloskey 1980; Gorr 1986;\nMurray and Dudrick 1995; Berman 2002; Garnett 2018; one who disagrees\nis Carr 1988). The disagreement seems to be over whether to identify\ninstances of coercion with one or the other of the two faces mentioned\nat the outset: that is, to identify it with a kind of behavior by the\ncoercer (which may or may not be successful), or to identify it with\nspecific events in the life of the coercee (namely, those that alter\nor constrain her activities). Several authors, picking up on the\ndisagreement, have suggested that we might distinguish coercion from\ncoerciveness, associating the former with completed, successful\nattempts, and the latter with qualities of the attempt itself (Lamond,\n2000).\n\nOf course, if the coercee defies the coercer, there is no coerced\naction to investigate, nor any question to answer about responsibility\nfor such an action. There is also reason to doubt that what the\ncoercer did in such cases rises to meet the bar at which we should\nconsider it coercive. (If a threat is trivial, we would likely resist\nsaying that an agent was coerced by it even if she acts to prevent its\nexecution.) On the other hand, it may be unwise to make a categorical\ndistinction between cases in which coercion succeeds and cases where\nit fails: the difference between them on some occasions may be nothing\nmore than what mood the coercee happened to be in at the time. Since\nthe coercer has the final and definitive say over whether he will\nengage in coercive activity (and who will be engaged by it), it may\nmake more sense to identify our phenomenon of interest with a certain\nform of activity by the coercer, admitting that such activity may or\nmay not result in any further noticeable consequences. (The would-be\ncoercer may of course be bluffing, and the prospective coercee may\ncall the bluff; this would not, by itself, give reason to deny that we\nhave here an instance of the technique under study.)\n2.1.3 Is coercion conceptually limited to specific coerced acts?\n\nFinally, Nozick frames his analysis with respect to some particular\naction A taken or not taken by the coercee. The connection of\ncoercion to a specific action taken or foregone has seemed natural to\nalmost all subsequent commentators, even though it raises some\nproblems of which at least Nozick himself seems to have been aware. In\nthe short detour that is the second section of his essay, Nozick poses\nquestions of the following sort: If P coerces Q into\ndoing A, and B and C are the only ways to\ndo A, does P coerce Q into doing B\n(assuming that is the means Q chose)? Similarly, if\nP coerces Q into not doing A, and\nA is a necessary precursor to B, does P\ncoerce Q into not doing B? Does it matter whether\nQ was already aiming/hoping/expecting to do B? More\ngenerally, if as a result of prior acts of coercion by P, an\nact A is no longer possible for Q (perhaps\nQ doesn\u2019t think about it at all), has P\ncoerced Q into not A-ing? Nozick broaches questions\nof these sorts, but leaves them aside without much mention of their\nsignificance (See Nozick 1969, 445\u201347). Taken seriously,\nhowever, they would force some significant revisions to the way\ntheorists have analyzed coercion. They show that there may be\ndifficulties in identifying coercion strictly with actions taken or\nforegone, since it may be impossible to determine just what actions\nthis description includes.\n\nMore generally, Nozick\u2019s analysis emphasizes the alteration in\nthe coercee\u2019s choice of actions which results from the way the\ncoercer\u2019s proposal affects her reasons for acting. While this is\ncertainly a plausible approach for distinguishing coerced from\nuncoerced acts, it puts the focus on how the coercee perceives her\nsituation; it is only via this reflection that it takes into account\nhow the coercer is able to create this perception. That is, it leaves\nthe standard sorts of means (force, violence, perhaps even economic\ndeprivation) that coercers use out of the account, and instead treats\nall kinds of alterations to the coercee\u2019s costs and benefits to\nacting as possible indications of coercion. While this more ecumenical\napproach to coercion may succeed in encompassing ways of coercing that\nthe traditional theories would leave out, it creates a difficult\nchallenge for the theory to distinguish coercive from non-coercive\nproposals. It is not surprising, therefore, that these are the issues\nthat have been the focus of most subsequent theorizing on the\nsubject.\n2.2 Threats and Baselines\n\nSince Nozick\u2019s essay, theorists have frequently treated the\nmaking of a conditional threat as an essential factor in coercion. The\nlargest single effort expended in analyzing coercion has been devoted\nto making sense of such threats, and determining their relationship to\ncoercion. Some, however, have questioned the linking of coercion with\nthreats, and suggested that conditional offers too can be coercive.\nBoth conditional threats and conditional offers can be said to be\nproposals, where the distinction between them is their relationship to\nsome baseline representing the coercee\u2019s situation prior to the\nproposal: compared to the baseline, threats worsen the coercee\u2019s\nsituation, while offers do not. In this and the next two sections,\nwe\u2019ll examine some of the issues involved here. In Section 2.5\nwe\u2019ll consider some approaches to coercion that attempt to\nescape from a \u201cbaseline\u201d analysis of threats and\noffers.\n\nMost will recognize the connection of coercion with threats as a\nmatter of common sense: armed robbers, mafias, the parents of young\nchildren, and the state all make conditional threats with the\nintention of reducing the eligibility of some actions, making other\nactions more attractive by comparison. Note, however, that offers may\nalso be made with the same general intention as coercive threats: that\nis, to make some actions more attractive, others less so. Consider the\nbasic structure of a conditional threat by P that attaches\nundesirable consequences C to some action A by\nQ:\n\nP claims that (P will bring about consequences\nC if and only if Q does A).\n\n\nThis proposition has the same structure as an ordinary offer by\nP to do something Q desires if Q agrees to\npay for it, but not otherwise. Conversely, any ordinary offer has the\nsame structure as a threat. This suggests that any proposal whatever\nmay be read as a threat or an offer, depending on the relationship\nbetween the proposal and some specifiable external factors.\n(\u201cYour money or your life\u201d might equally be proposed by a\nback-alley robber or a pharmaceutical company; in one case it\u2019s\na robbery, in the other case it may be a life-saving offer.) The idea\nthat threats coerce while offers don\u2019t is frequently thought to\nbe connected to the fact that threats propose to make their recipient\nworse off than she would have been otherwise. If so, we are required\nto specify how we should pick out and assess the relata in this\ncomparison, which is trickier than it may at first appear. Consider\nfirst the question of what aspect of the proposal is relevant for this\ncomparison; and then second what relevant comparison case (usually\ncalled the \u201cbaseline\u201d) should be used.\n\nAny bi-conditional proposal can be analyzed into a conjunction of two\ncomponent simple conditionals, both of which must be true if the\nbi-conditional itself is true. However, only one of the two\nconditionals will have its antecedent satisfied (depending on what\nQ chooses to do), and will thus govern what comes about as a\nconsequence. If the proposal is to have a motivational effect on its\nrecipient, it will be because the recipient prefers that one of the\ntwo possible consequents be realized \u2014 either that P\nbrings about C, or that P does not bring about\nC \u2014 so we may suppose that it is the difference in\nQ\u2019s valuation of these consequents that motivates (if\nanything does) Q to act in response to P\u2019s\nproposal. (If the agent is indifferent between the two states, we may\nconsider the proposal to be an offer, but too unattractive an offer to\ntempt one to accept it.) So we look to the conditional containing the\nless-preferred consequent, and compare it to the baseline in order to\nsee whether P\u2019s proposal makes Q worse off\nthan she would be in the relevant alternative state of affairs. (The\nfollowing analysis slightly modifies the analysis in Gorr 1986,\n391\u2013397; and Berman 2002,\n 55\u201359.[9])\n\nSo, for instance, an armed robber issues a proposal to a passerby that\namounts to the following conditionals:\n\n(a) If she keeps her valuables, he will harm her;\n\n\n(b) if she hands them over, he will not.\n\n\nThe passerby prefers the consequent in (b), so we compare the\nconditional (a) to the baseline. Normally, one faces no harm if one\nkeeps one\u2019s valuables. So the first conditional makes the\npasserby worse off than she would normally be, thus turning the\nrobber\u2019s proposal into a threat.\n\nBy contrast, consider the offer of a salesman who proposes to a\ncustomer the following:\n\n(c) If the customer pays X, he will provide her a vacation\npackage;\n\n\n(d) if she does not pay X, he provides no vacation\npackage.\n\n\nAssuming the customer would prefer having the vacation package to not\nhaving the vacation package, the second conditional contains the less\npreferred consequent. But receiving no free vacation is quite normal,\nso one is no worse off when the second conditional is operative than\nunder normal circumstances. Hence the salesman is making only an\noffer, not a threat.\n\n(Some have discussed \u201cthroffers,\u201d which are proposals that\nmake one better off than normal under one conditional, worse off than\nnormal under the alternative conditional. On the above analysis,\nthroffers will be included among the threats because the conditional\ncontaining the less-preferred consequent makes one worse off than one\nnormally would be.)\n\nThis analysis works well enough for most purposes. Since we quite\noften know what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s not, threats and\noffers are usually easily distinguished. Difficulties arise, however,\nwhen this is not the case.\n2.3 Moralized vs. non-moralized baselines\n\nNozick explains the idea of the baseline by calling it the\n\u201cnormal or natural or expected course of events\u201d (Nozick\n1969, 447). But all of these terms are ambiguous, in that they have\nnormative (or \u201cmoral\u201d) and non-normative (e.g.,\n\u201cpredictive\u201d) uses. Frequently, the normative and\npredictive uses will point to the same state of affairs as the course\nof events that is indicated. However, the extensions of the normative\nand non-normative uses will sometimes differ, thus requiring a\ntheorist to choose one or the other in order to determine whether a\nparticular communication counts as a threat or an offer, and is\ntherefore coercive or not.\n\nNozick offers two of the best known cases in which the normative and\nnon-normative baselines would appear to diverge. Here\u2019s one of\nthem (Nozick 1969,\n 450\u201351):[10]\n\nThe slave case:\n\nP is a slave owner who regularly beats his slave Q.\nOne day P proposes to spare Q his regular beating if\nand only if Q now does A.\n\n\nQ prefers not to be beaten, so we look to the conditional\n\n(e) If Q does not do A, P will beat\nQ.\n\n\nSince P beats Q regularly, this conditional\u2019s\nbecoming operative makes Q no worse off than what Q\nfinds normal or expected (statistically speaking). So\nP\u2019s proposal amounts to an offer, not a threat, on this\nway of understanding of what\u2019s normal. Yet we would reasonably\nhold that if Q elects to escape a beating by doing\nA, Q\u2019s choice is made in response to a threat\nof a beating, and is thus coerced.\n\nThe slave case demonstrates an ambiguity in our thought about\n\u201cwhat is normal\u201d (or \u201cwhat is expected\u201d).\nAlthough the slave is typically beaten and predicts he\u2019ll be\nbeaten based on past history, we expect on moral grounds that people\nare not beaten for no reason. Given the moral sense of what is normal,\nthe slave owner\u2019s proposition amounts to a threat, thus\nvalidating our sense that the slave is coerced into doing A.\nEspecially in contexts of entrenched injustice, the\n\u201cmoral\u201d and \u201cpredictive\u201d baselines may\ndiverge, forcing us to choose between them.\n\nActually, any number of different possible baselines might be\nconstructed for judging whether a proposal makes one better or worse\noff than the baseline. There are different ways of making a\nprediction; there are different \u201cmoral\u201d standards; there\nare also ways of taking into consideration what the recipient of the\nproposal would want. So divergences among the many possible baselines\nmay be more common than we might at first suspect. This requires us to\nfind a way to choose among the possibly diverging baselines. Nozick,\nfor instance, proposes that when the \u201cpredictive\u201d and the\n\u201cmoral\u201d baselines diverge, we turn to the preferences of\nthe recipient of the proposal, and use the baseline he prefers. In the\nslave case above, Nozick reasonably supposes that the slave would\nprefer that \u201cnormal\u201d meant \u201cmoral\u201d; in which\ncase the slave would not be beaten even if he did not do A.\nBy comparison to this baseline, the slave-owner\u2019s proposal is a\nthreat, not an offer.\n\nSome theorists have noticed that what the proposal recipient wants to\nhappen may differ from both the moral and predictive baselines.\nMichael Gorr, for instance, argues that if preferences are important\nwhen the baselines diverge, \u201cit is unclear why they should be\nless so in cases where the two baselines coincide.\u201d Hence he\nfavors an account that \u201cmakes the subject\u2019s preferences a\ncontrolling factor in all cases\u201d (Gorr 1986,\n398\u2013399; see also Rhodes 2000). The difficulty with this\nsuggestion, however, is that it\u2019s very difficult to craft\nconstraints on what preferences will count for how things go; people\ncan want others to do or omit doing almost anything. Suppose we agree\nit is normal in both the moral and predictive senses for workers who\nshirk to be fired, and for customers who refuse to pay utility bills\nto have their electricity cut off. Of course, workers and customers\nwould likely prefer to get paid for nothing, and to get their\nelectricity for free. Compared to these baselines, proposing to fire\nor to cut off electricity to someone amounts to going out of\none\u2019s way to attach undesirable consequences to some\n(non\u2011)action A. On Gorr\u2019s criteria, it would\nappear, both of these threats count as coercive threats, yet both seem\nto be parts of ordinary, non-coercive commerce based on offers and\n acceptances.[11]\n At any rate, it is difficult to see how a fully preference-based\nbaseline account can avoid seeing coercion in a vast array of\nsituations where our pre-theoretic views would deny it.\n\nThose who opt for a moralized baseline approach seem to offer a more\nplausible approach. The most prominent of these theorists has been\nAlan Wertheimer, whose book Coercion sets the current\nstandard and starting point for continued scholarship in this\n area.[12]\n Since only threats coerce, but not all threats do, he provides a\ntwo-pronged test for whether a proposal constitutes a coercive threat\n(Wertheimer 1987, especially chs. 2, 12, and 14). The proposal\nconstitutes a threat if the proposer indicates that, if his\ndemand is denied, he will make the recipient worse off than the\nrecipient ought to be. (In particular, Wertheimer believes that this\nis frequently best understood as a question of whether the proposer\nproposes to violate the recipient\u2019s rights (Wertheimer\n1987,\n 217).)[13]\n Yet the mere fact that something threatens one is not sufficient to\nground a claim that it coerces anyone; the threat may be wrongful but\nalso trivial. So Wertheimer requires that the choice forced upon the\ncoercee be such that she has no reasonable choice but to succumb. This\ntoo requires a contextually specific, moralized judgment, Wertheimer\nthinks. One might, for instance, be supported in a claim that a\nthreatened beating left one \u201cno choice\u201d but to sign a\ncontract; the same might not be said about a choice to commit\nmurder.\n\nWertheimer\u2019s approach is developed and defended by surveying\nlegal reasoning in the U.S. and its common-law tradition with respect\nto such matters as contracts, criminal responsibility, plea bargains,\nblackmail, and consent to searches and medical procedures. His work\nhas been influential among many who have tried to determine what the\nlaw should say about various coercive phenomena, and Wertheimer\nhimself has offered further applications of his theories in subsequent\nwork, including a book on consent to sexual relations (Wertheimer\n2004). Wertheimer\u2019s moralized account and moralized theories of\ncoercion more generally raise some difficulties for understanding how\nthere could be \u201cjustified coercion,\u201d such as law\nenforcement, in that they tend to associate uses of coercion with\nimmoral action. Some of these difficulties are considered in Section\n3.4 below.\n2.4 Coercive Offers?\n\nWhile the dominant strand in recent theory has associated coercion\nwith threats, and denied that offers can be used to coerce, this sharp\ndifferentiation of these two sorts of proposals has come in for some\ncriticism. The parallel structure of conditional threats and\nconditional offers has led some to deny that there is a deep\ndistinction to be made between them. Others have focused on the role\nof both in the broader political and economic context, and found that\nthese broader conditions make coercive offers a live possibility.\nDealings in capitalist markets are often highly exploitative;\ngovernments often condition the provision of ordinary benefits on the\nsatisfaction of unrelated demands (such as making highway funding\nconditional on states\u2019 passing particular laws). Given the\npotency such offers possess, one might suspect that there are many\noffers that one cannot reasonably refuse, possibly reflecting great\nimbalances in power or prior historical injustices between the\nbargaining parties. (See, for instance, O\u2019Neill 1991; and Berman\n2001.)\n\nOf those who have argued that threats and offers can both be used\ncoercively, David Zimmerman has been most prominent (Zimmerman 1981;\nothers who have argued offers can coerce include Frankfurt 1988\n[1973]; Held 1972; Lyons 1975; Van De Veer 1979; Benditt 1979;\nFeinberg 1986; Stevens 1988; Rocha 2011; for criticism of Zimmerman,\nHeld, and Stevens, see Alexander 1981; Bayles 1974; and Swanton 1989,\nrespectively). Retaining the baseline-approach to coercion found in\nNozick, Zimmerman urges that in setting a baseline for judging a\nproposal, we should take into account the possibility that the\nproposal maker is actively hindering the coercee from obtaining a\nsituation for herself that would be better than the situation the\ncoercer proposes. So, for instance, if a person is destitute on an\nisland, and someone proposes to employ this person for a\nlife-sustaining pittance, this proposal may count as an offer, since\nit is an improvement over the \u201cpre-proposal\u201d situation.\nBut if the person is destitute and unable to obtain better conditions\nonly because the employer actively prevents the person from leaving\nthe island (say, by preventing the building of boats), Zimmerman\nsuggests the offer should be regarded as coercive. That\u2019s\nbecause the appropriate baseline for evaluating the proposal is the\nstate of affairs that the recipient would face in the absence of\nspecial interference by the proposal maker. (In the present case, this\nmight be the situation the island inhabitant would face were she able\nto build a boat and return to the mainland.) If relative to this\nbaseline the offer is less favored, then it should count as coercive,\nZimmerman thinks.\n\nDo such offers coerce? The dispute between those who say offers can\ncoerce, such as Zimmerman, and those who insist only threats coerce\nmay be more verbal than substantive. While Zimmerman, for instance,\nwould label the offer itself coercive, what appears to do the coercing\nhere is whatever means were or are being used to keep the recipient of\nthe offer from reaching a better bargaining state. If the offering\nparty here has created the conditions that make even very unattractive\noffers still the best available, then the coercion, if there is any,\nseems to be vested in the offerer\u2019s actions that prevent the\nrecipient from improving her situation or finding better offers\nelsewhere.\n\nZimmerman grants that even if the offering party does not cause the\nrecipient to be in the position she\u2019s in, we may still want to\ncriticize such offers. In these cases, the offer-maker may be guilty\nof engaging in exploitation, though not coercion. When one\nparty is in a much stronger bargaining position than another, the\nstronger party sometimes uses its advantage to keep for itself most or\nall of the gains to be had from cooperative interaction between the\nparties. So employers who are in a stronger bargaining position than\ntheir employees may exploit them by paying them a small fraction of\nthe value their labor contributes to the production of goods for the\nemployer. This is especially feasible when one party has a relative\nmonopoly position with respect to some valuable good (say, employment\nopportunities). So, reconfiguring Zimmerman\u2019s results somewhat,\nwe might retain the exclusive connection between threats and coercion\nby saying that offers made from a position of superior bargaining\nstrength are very likely to be exploitative; and that sometimes\ncoercion is used to create or maintain one\u2019s bargaining\nadvantages.\n\nNot all, however, would accept that the coerciveness of a large\ndifferential in bargaining power depends upon its causal origins. Joan\nMcGregor, for example, gives an analysis of such offers in an account\nthat eschews the baseline approach. She argues, \u201cthe\n\u2018better off\u2019/\u2018worse off\u2019 distinction ignores\nthe power relationships that occur when there are radically disparate\nbargaining strengths\u201d (McGregor 1988\u201389, 24). To assess\nthe coerciveness of something like an economic transaction, one must\ninstead attend to the relative strengths of the bargaining positions\nbetween parties involved. \u201c[C]oercion involves exercising power\nover another; in the market, it involves exercising superior\nbargaining power\u201d (McGregor 1988\u201389, 25). At least two of\nthe conditions for having bargaining power sufficient to coerce\nanother are that the weaker party is dependent in some way on\nthe stronger party (e.g., there are no other options or potential\nexchange partners), and the stronger party has influence over whether\nsome significant evil occurs to the weaker party (such as\nloss of life, health, security) (McGregor 1988\u201389, 34). If in\naddition the stronger party decides to take advantage of these\nconditions, then this is not just exploitation but coercion. While the\ndetails of her account of bargaining strength may raise difficulties,\nher attempt to incorporate a measure of the coercer\u2019s power into\nthe account of coercion seems a useful if relatively under-explored\napproach. Arguably, a consideration such as this motivates Serena\nOlsaretti in her argument that markets might preserve freedom while\nalso undermining voluntariness in a fashion similar to that of\ncoercive threats (Olsaretti 2004, ch. 6).\n2.5 Non-baseline approaches\n\nThe need to establish a baseline is generated by a need to distinguish\nthreats from offers as a central criterion of coercion. Threats and\noffers are both proposals put to the coercee, aiming to influence her\nbehavior, and distinguished with respect to how they affect what is\nnormal for the coercee. There are two main ways in which some\ntheorists have diverged from the baseline-style account that Nozick\nproposed, each of these ways admitting of both moralized and\nnon-moralized versions. Instead of distinguishing threats and offers\nfrom what\u2019s normal for the agent, we might instead see threats\nas applying a special sort or degree of pressure on the\ncoercee\u2019s will. Or, we might move away from focusing on the\ncoercee\u2019s will as the locus of coercion, and instead look at the\npowers, intentions, and activities of coercers. A\n\u201ccoercer-focused\u201d account seeks to determine what is\nspecial about coercive actions, rather than trying to distinguish\ncoerced from non-coerced actions.\n\nOne way to identify coercive threats is by looking for a distinctive\nway that pressure can affect a coercee\u2019s will. Sometimes, a use\nof threats conditioned on the agent\u2019s activities may affect not\njust the coercee\u2019s choice but also her ability to choose at all.\nUnder severe psychological pressure, faced with grave dangers or\nsignificant evils, people sometimes react in ways that diverge from\n(or at least do not follow from) their more rational, considered\ndesires. Harry Frankfurt seems to make this effect a requirement for\nsomething to count as coercive, saying \u201cA coercive threat\narouses in its victim a desire \u2014 i.e. to avoid the penalty\n\u2014 so powerful that it will move him to perform the required\naction whether he wants to perform it or considers that it would be\nreasonable for him to do so\u201d (Frankfurt 1988 [1973], 78).\nFrankfurt has several reasons for insisting on this strong\nrequirement, but perhaps most central is his view that coercion must\nhave such an overbearing effect if it is to override the\ncoercee\u2019s moral responsibility for acting (Frankfurt 1988\n[1973], 75\u201376). However, if one treats such overburdening as a\nsufficient condition for coercion, then this again lends support to\nthe view that some offers \u2014 irresistible ones \u2014 will also\nturn out to be coercive. Though the fact that Q\u2019s will was\noverborne would seem compatible with the claim that Q has been\ncoerced, few besides Frankfurt have taken such overburdening to be a\nnecessary condition for coercion to take\n place.[14]\n\nShort of generating psychological compulsion, one might hold that\ncoercion involves the imposition of an option which no one could\nreasonably refuse to take. Several have tried to characterize such\nsituations in a way that neither reduces to a form of psychological\ndeterminism, nor implicitly invokes baseline comparisons. For\ninstance, Mark Fowler argues that \u201ccoercion generally involves\nthe prima facie immoral imposition of practical imperatives by use of\nthreats\u201d (Fowler 1982, 330). While this approach must be\nsupplemented with further details (including, perhaps, a resort to a\nbaseline to distinguish threats from offers), its principal\ncontribution is its reliance on \u201cpractical imperatives.\u201d\nFowler suggests that we need to see coercion in relation to our\nunderstanding of how practical reason works. When we say that the\ncoercer leaves the coercee \u201cno choice,\u201d we don\u2019t\nnecessarily mean that the coercee is literally unable to choose, but\nthat for the coercee to choose otherwise than the coercer demands\nwould be contrary to practical reason (Fowler 1982, 331).\n\nThe normative approach Fowler favors links this criterion to a Kantian\naccount of autonomy, and suggests that the test of a coercive threat\nis that it violates the coercee\u2019s autonomy. This would appear to\nproduce a mismatch between our pre-theoretic understanding of coercion\nand the cases that will satisfy Fowler\u2019s conditions \u2014 for\ninstance, giving someone a false \u201cwarning\u201d arguably\nviolates her autonomy, but this seems different than coercion. Yet if\nthere is a way to make sense of the notion of imposing a practical\nimperative, this seems a useful element of an account of coercion.\n\nJoel Feinberg identifies coercion with a special degree or kind of\npressure imposed on the coercee\u2019s will, but avoids connecting\npressure to a normative judgment. His account is tailored to cases\nwhere the coercer seeks to obtain a token of \u201cconsent\u201d to\nsome harmful or dangerous activity from the coercee, but it could\neasily be generalized to cover other sorts of coerced activities. His\naccount starts by offering a helpful description of the role of the\ncoercer, stipulating that the coercer:\n\nthreatens to \u201ccause or fail to prevent some consequences that\n[the coercee] finds unwelcome\u201d; and\n\n\n\u201cgives some evidence of the credibility of the threat\u201d;\nand\n\n\u201chas actively intervened in [the coercee\u2019s]\noption-network, to acquire control of the relevant option-switches; in\nparticular he can close tight the conjunctive option that consists of\n[the coercee\u2019s] noncompliance with the demand and [the\ncoercee\u2019s] avoidance of the threatened unwelcome\nconsequences\u201d (Feinberg 1986, 198).\n [15]\n\n\nThese stipulations are useful supplements to the Nozickian-style\naccount, in that they require the coercer to demonstrate his power,\nand to actively use it to create the situation facing the coercee, in\nparticular by preventing the coercee from finding ways to avoid the\nforced\n choice.[16]\n\nThe bulk of Feinberg\u2019s account focuses instead, however, on how\ncoercive proposals can generate pressure on the coercee\u2019s will\nthat, if not irresistible, is sufficiently strong to make the\ncoercee\u2019s choice unfree. This account avoids a reliance on\nbaselines because it makes the coercee\u2019s judgment of the\nfrightfulness, unwelcomeness and pressure involved in the threat the\nkey criterion for determining whether it coerces. Feinberg goes on to\ngive a detailed discussion of how one might compare the pressures\ninvolved when coercers issue various sorts of demands coupled with\nvarious sorts of threats, suggesting ways of calculating the\n\u201ctotal coercive burden\u201d a threat creates for a\ncoercee.\n\nFeinberg\u2019s account generates a number of apparently troubling\nresults. For one thing, it will allow that extremely tempting offers\nare coercive if they create pressure similar to that associated with\ncoercive threats; the only thing that seems to count is how much\npressure one feels to act. It will also treat people with non-standard\npreferences or fears (say, a dire fear of being patted on the back) as\nhaving been \u201ccoerced\u201d by threats to do what are,\nobjectively speaking, trivial things (Feinberg 1986, 212).\n\nA different way of understanding coercion moves away from focusing on\nits impact on the coercee. Some approaches, like McGregor\u2019s\nnoted above, look for coercion in the coercer\u2019s taking advantage\nof certain sorts of power differentials between coercer and coercee.\nOthers identify coercion with the making of threats, but seek to\ndistinguish threats from offers in ways that avoid reference to a\nbaseline, and instead look at the qualities of the coercer and his\nactivities. Mitchell Berman, following Vinit Haksar, has argued for an\napproach the crux of which holds that immoral coercive threats propose\nto do something that would be immoral to do if carried out. (See\nBerman 2002; Haksar 1976.) (Berman does not, it appears, offer a\ndefinition of coercion per se, but only of wrongful\ncoercion.) Grant Lamond focuses instead on the coercer\u2019s\nintentional attempt to use pressure to alter the activities of the\ncoercee, where that pressure comes from an intention to deliberately\nset back the interests of the coercee. (See Lamond 1996 and 2000.)\nBecause McGregor\u2019s, Berman\u2019s and Lamond\u2019s ways of\ncapturing coercion attend to the coercer\u2019s actions and\nintentions, they avoid the need to distinguish coercive from other\nproposals based on specific effects on the coercee. (For that reason,\nthey could also reject the \u201csuccess\u201d condition on coercion\nfound in Nozick\u2019s and most subsequent accounts of coercion.)\n\nScott Anderson, drawing upon some remarks of J. R. Lucas (1966), takes\na different tack, and associates coercion with the use of an ability\nsome agents have to enforce their decisions about what another will or\nwill not do, \u201cwhere the sense of enforceability here is\nexemplified by the use of force, violence and the threats thereof to\nconstrain, disable, harm or undermine an agent\u2019s ability to\nact\u201d (Anderson 2010, 6). Anderson thus rejects Nozick\u2019s\ninnovations in this area (see above Section 2.1) by refocusing the\nanalysis on the powers and acts of the coercer (rather than on the\nwill or actions of the coercee), by allowing that direct force (and\nnot just threats) can be used to coerce, and denying that coercion is\ncoextensive with particular acts taken or avoided by the coercee.\nAnderson requires that the coercer engage in activity either to create\na power differential between himself and the coercee (say, by taking\nup arms), or else draw upon some existing differential between agents\nof the sorts to which coercer and coercee belong (say, policeman and\ncitizen, respectively). This \u201cenforcement approach\u201d\nsuggests that uses of these sorts of powers are distinctive, and thus\ncan be used to pick out long-standing threats (such as the criminal\nlaw) as coercive, even if it is difficult to identify specific actions\nthat they alter.\n3. Uses for thought about coercion\n\nAlthough some writings on coercion might appear to aim principally for\nconceptual clarification, theorists of coercion more often aim to\nanswer questions that have practical import for ethics, judicial\ndecisions, political or legal theory, and social policy. Some of the\nmost common implications of claims about coercion are explored below.\nThe four subsections here (on the ethics of coercion, responsibility\nunder coercion, its effect on freedom, and its legal and political\nimplications) overlap in various ways, so while these subsections have\ndistinct foci, the discussions should not be taken to be fully\nindependent of one another.\n3.1 The ethics of coercion\n\nIn section 3.3, we\u2019ll consider how coercion is thought to\nimpinge upon freedom, something that raises obvious ethical\nimplications in its own right. So consideration of these sorts of\nethical issues will be postponed until there. The present section\nlooks at certain more basic questions about whether and why employing\ncoercion is necessarily or contingently wrongful, as well as whether\nits wrongfulness is intrinsic to it or derivative, and what else might\nbe wrong with it besides its effect on freedom or autonomy.\n\nThere has been considerable debate over the question of whether\nemploying coercion is necessarily or contingently wrongful. There seem\nto be three categories in which answers to this question might fall:\ncoercion is necessarily wrongful; it is prima facie or\npro tanto wrongful, though it may be justified by further\nfacts; and it is intrinsically morally neutral, though some uses of it\nmay be wrongful because of specific facts about them. Differences in\nunderstanding what is wrongful about it may account for these\ndifferent positions. Further, in cases where coercion is wrongful, we\nmight distinguish two different ways of explaining the nature of its\nwrongfulness. It might be a basic wrong, in that being coercive is\nsufficient to justify the judgment that it is wrongful; or, otherwise,\nwe can explain its wrongfulness as deriving from some component\nactivity that is wrongful, so that coercion\u2019s wrongfulness is\nderivative, rather than\n basic.[17]\n\nOne route to finding coercion is necessarily wrongful is to define\ncoercion as constitutively involving a violation or threatened\nviolation of the coercee\u2019s rights, or a proposal to violate\none\u2019s normative obligations. For instance, Cheyney Ryan argues\nfor such a normative conception of coercion. (See Ryan 1980.) Tying\ncoercion closely to immoral action captures a number of intuitions we\nhave about coercion, reflecting also a lot of ordinary language.\nPeople often associate uses of coercion with injustices done to\nthemselves or others. This tie also provides a sharper division\nbetween coercive and non-coercive activity than might otherwise be\nfound: if an activity is morally unobjectionable, then it is ipso\nfacto not coercive.\n\nIf coercion is not necessarily wrongful, it might still involve moral\njudgment by being defined as requiring some prima facie or\npro tanto immoral element; this is probably the most commonly\nheld view. There have been a variety of different attempts, especially\nin the 21st century, to find and describe the immoral\nfactor in coercion that will then suffice to explain its wrongfulness\nwhen not rebutted, while avoiding the miscategorization of cases.\n\nOne suggestion holds that what is distinctive about coercion and gives\nit its moral character is that it involves an instrumental making of a\nthreat to do something wrongful. Following Niko Kolodny we might call\nthis the \u201cinheritance\u201d view (Kolodny 2017). For instance,\nMitchell Berman has argued that when a coercer threatens to do\nsomething, the rightness or wrongness of the use of such a threat to\ncoerce depends on whether it would be rightful or wrongful for that\nagent to carry through with that threat (Berman 2002; see also Haksar\n1976; Wertheimer 1987, ch. 12). Berman\u2019s account of wrongful\ncoercion thus apparently relies on a principle of inference that holds\nthat if it is wrong to do A, then it is wrong to\nthreaten to do A, and vice versa. Japa\nPallikkathayil sketches a similar view, holding that if the\ncoercer\u2019s proposal has motivational force only because it\nproposes to do something that the recipient should have a right to\nveto, then such a proposal (in at least paradigmatic cases of\ncoercion) wrongfully constrains the recipient, and wrongfully impinges\non their normative powers. Here too, the wrongfulness of the proposal\ndepends on the wrongfulness of the thing the coercer proposes to do\n(Pallikkathayil 2011). Benjamin Sachs suggests a claim that might\nbolster Berman\u2019s position, namely, that the very making of the\nthreat has the tendency to increase the likelihood that the threatener\nwill carry out the wrongful act threatened, which he describes as\n\u201cself-incitement\u201d (Sachs 2013). The\n\u201cinheritance\u201d view is similarly defended by James Shaw\n(2012), in his account of the immorality of blackmail.\n\nThe inheritance view does not seem to correctly categorize or explain\nthe morality of all cases that are intuitively regarded as coercive.\nAt least sometimes it appears appropriate to threaten to do something\nwhich would be wrong to carry out (nuclear deterrence is sometimes\nthought to be like this; see Section 4.1 below). And sometimes it may\nbe wrongful to threaten what it would be right to carry out (some\ninstances of blackmail and extortion seem to fit this description).\nThe inheritance view also does not explain why making a conditional\nthreat may be more ethically problematic than a plain,\nunconditional\n threat.[18]\n Unfortunately, the complexities due particularly to the\nconditionality of coercive threats have been little explored to date\nby those more centrally interested in\n coercion.[19]\n\nA second suggestion holds that there\u2019s something special about\nthe coercer\u2019s intention vis-\u00e0-vis the coercee that makes\ncoercion frequently problematic. Grant Lamond suggests that the\nwrongness of wrongful coercion derives from the fact that it involves\na \u201cproposal deliberately to impose a disadvantage on\nanother\u201d (Lamond 2000, 49). \u201cThe distinctive wrong\ninvolved in [coercive conditional] threats is to propose to take an\naction because it is unwelcome to the recipient, i.e.,\nbecause he does not want it done\u201d (Lamond 1996, 228). It is thus\nthe coercer\u2019s intention to harm or disadvantage the coercee (or\nto propose to do so) that creates coercion\u2019s special burden of\njustification (though Lamond does not suppose such justifications are\nparticularly difficult to find). But it isn\u2019t clear either that\nwhen one proposes to harm another that one thereby intends to\nbring about any harm (one could be\n bluffing).[20]\n More importantly, it\u2019s also unclear that all intentions to\nimpose disadvantages are even prima facie in need of\njustification. Unless we accept that all activities are prima\nfacie unjustified absent specific justifications, it requires an\nargument to show that disadvantaging another person is itself\nsomething that always must clear a hurdle to count as justified.\nCertainly some kinds of disadvantage require special justification,\nbut some may not. One might, for instance, intend to disadvantage\none\u2019s social rival by arranging to have him seated between two\ndreary bores at a dinner party. While perhaps not nice, it seems to\nrequire no special moral justification for this action (or the threat\nof this action) to be ethically permissible. We might say that so long\nas one respects the rights of others (a set as rich as one likes), one\nneeds no special justification to act towards them as one likes. And\nsurely no one has the right that no one else will ever act for the\nsake of disadvantaging one. If this is the case, then the mere\nintention to disadvantage someone, perhaps conditionally, does not\nsuffice to violate her rights.\n\nStephen White takes notice of the fact that sometimes we find coercion\nproblematic even if the coercer\u2019s threat involves something that\nit would not be wrongful for the coercer to do (White 2017). Cases of\nblackmail, both conventional and \u201cemotional blackmail,\u201d\noften have this form: the threatener threatens to do something they\nmay well have legal and moral right to do considered by itself, but\nsomething that would not otherwise be tied to the actions of the\nthreat\u2019s recipient. White argues that what coercers do in making\nconditional threats is to make the coercee responsible for the\ncoercer\u2019s execution of their threat, a responsibility that in\nmany cases they should not have to bear. This seems most clear in\ncases where the coercer threatens to do something independently\nwrongful, since they are obligated not to carry out such a threat, so\ntransferring that responsibility to the coercee is clearly wrongful.\nBut even if the act threatened, such as self-harm, is not\nindependently wrongful, forcing another to regard this outcome as\ntheir responsibility to prevent generates an unfair burden. This\nanalysis is argued to help explain some other intuitions we have\nregarding the threat of wrongful coercion to autonomy and its\ndeforming of the coercee\u2019s choice situation.\n\nBeyond wronging the target of coercion, there are arguably other\nethical implications of coercion. While acknowledging that the concept\nof coercion is often invoked to play a role in \u201cdeontic\u201d\njudgments, identifying interpersonal wrongs, Michael Garnett aims to\nexpand the scope of our ethical concern with coercion by\ndistinguishing this deontic role from a principally\neudaimonistic role for a concept of coercion. Garnett argues\nthat coercion is bad for the individual insofar as it amounts to\none\u2019s will being subjected to a foreign will\u2014that of the\ncoercer\u2014independently of whether the coercion is wrongful\n(Garnett 2018; similar concerns with coercion are raised in Julius\n2013 and Kolodny 2017). Similarly, Elinor Mason holds that coercion is\na kind of violation of agent integrity, by virtue of being subjected\nto the domination of the coercer. She claims, \u201cThe coercer makes\na proposal to the coercee, and provides substantial reasons for the\ncoercee to do what the coercer desires. The coercer is attempting to\ndominate the coercee: the coercer is not treating the coercee as an\nagent, but as an object to be manipulated. The coercee finds the\nproposal credible, and accepts the reasons provided as substantial. As\na result of the proposal, the coercee is dominated: she is alienated\nfrom her action\u201d (Mason 2012, 201). In a similar vein, Ambrose\nY. K. Lee argues that legal coercion used to incentivize people to do\nwhat they have otherwise good reason to do already fails to respect\npeople as \u201creasons-responsive agents\u201d (Lee 2014, 853). And\nJan-Willem van der Rijt suggests that it is a criterion of coercion\nthat the coercee feels subjectively wronged by it, thus making such\nfelt wrongness part of its essential meaning (van der Rijt 2011).\n\nThere are some situations in which the coerciveness of an action\nappears obvious even though it may be difficult or impossible to\nascertain its rightfulness or wrongfulness. Thus some (e.g., Zimmerman\n2002; Anderson 2010) have argued against making judgments of coercion\ndepend on prior moral judgments. For accounts of coercion that do not\ninvoke moral judgments to define it, the ethical implications of\ncoercion may be more contextual and determined by the particular uses\nto which it is put. If one holds the common view that coercion is\nrightly employed for purposes such as self-defense, defense of\ninnocent others, and the enforcement of just laws, such views may\nencourage one to evaluate its use based on factors such as why and how\nit is used, who uses it, against whom, in what circumstances, and what\nother means were possible instead. Coercion is no ordinary means, but\nif it can be defined in non-moralized terms, it\u2019s unclear why we\nshould suppose that it is intrinsically (even prima facie or\npro tanto) immoral, instead of simply noting that it is a\nvery potent means, prone to abuse, and something that deserves ethical\nscrutiny whenever it is used.\n3.2 The effect of coercion on coercee responsibility\n\nThere is no single, widely agreed upon theory that explains when an\nagent is or is not responsible for something that happens in the\nworld. Judgments of responsibility are normative, and may depend on\nother normative facts specific to the particular sort of action or\npractice in question. For instance, facts that might limit one\u2019s\nresponsibility for signing or violating a contract might fail to limit\none\u2019s responsibility for killing someone. So the effect of\ncoercion or its kin (duress, extortion) may differ depending upon the\nsort of action for which one seeks to limit one\u2019s\nresponsibility, or upon the moral context in which one acted.\nNonetheless, a few central cases and some general tendencies can be\ngiven with some confidence.\n\nThere are two traditional sorts of grounds on which an agent\u2019s\nresponsibility might be truncated or attenuated because he was\ncoerced. The first is by virtue of being excused for his action; the\nsecond is by virtue of his action\u2019s being justified. The exact\nunderstanding of this distinction is under continuing dispute, but\nhere is one way of understanding its most salient points. One may be\nexcused, in whole or in part, for an action performed under\ncoercion if that action (or its consequences) was beyond one\u2019s\ncontrol or willpower to prevent, or if that action (or its\nconsequences) was unintentional. This latter condition might obtain\nif, for instance, one acquiesces under coercion to do something\nintentionally (like driving a car), but in so doing one does something\nelse unintentionally (like helping a murderer escape). One is\njustified in acquiescing to coercion if one\u2019s action\n(or its consequences) is morally required, or is morally permissible\nunder the circumstances even if the action will foreseeably result in\nharm to others. (One obvious category of actions that carry such\njustifications are those taken to disable an attacker in self-defense\nor the defense of others.) However, the predominant recent accounts of\ncoercion seem to need additional filling in when queried for guidance\nto determine whether the target of coercion may be excused or\njustified for actions taken or forgone due to coercion.\n\nMost questions about coercion\u2019s effect on responsibility arise\nin cases of coercion via conditional threats. When an agent is\nconfronted by a threat, one ground on which her acquiescence may be\nexcused is if the threat causes a total breakdown in her will. Like\nother incapacities, this can affect her responsibility for actions\ntaken because she was truly unable to do otherwise. (This excuse may\nlead to questions about how the agent became vulnerable to suffering\nsuch a breakdown in agency; but in such cases she may be responsible\nfor her weakness of character, though perhaps not for her action.)\nExcuse may also be invoked when the coerced person acts in ignorance\nor if the harm she causes is unintentional (excuses which are\navailable regardless of whether one is coerced). But many people are\nable to react deliberately and rationally in response to coercive\nthreats. So it seems that most cases of diminished responsibility\nunder coercion will appeal to justification rather than excuse.\n\nSome accounts of coercion apply a moralized test to the\ncoercee\u2019s situation, holding that one may avoid responsibility\nfor an act taken under coercion if the coercer\u2019s proposal is\nsuch that one \u201cis entitled to yield to [the coercer\u2019s]\nproposal and then be released from the normal moral and legal\nconsequences of [one\u2019s] act\u201d (Wertheimer 1987, 267).\nSimilarly, Pallikkathayil argues that individuals have a right to a\n\u201cmoral veto\u201d over proposals that impermissibly restrain\ntheir options for action. When someone makes a coercive proposal that\nviolates this moral right of veto, this undermines the normative power\nof the coercee\u2019s will to consent to the terms of the proposal,\nand thus renders supposed consent ineffective, and thus undercuts\ntheir responsibility (Pallikkathayil 2011). Such moralized theories\nthus shift the explanatory burden from a theory of coercion to the\nbackground moral or normative theory they call upon to explain the\neffect of coercion on moral responsibility. Although there are some\nspecific moralized or normative tests one might use to decide\nresponsibility for action under coercion, it is unclear that any of\nthem is robust enough to handle more than a fraction of the\n cases.[21]\n\nOne test of responsibility that might be proposed would limit the\nresponsibility of someone acting under coercion if she acts in a way\nthat minimizes the total amount of harm (invoking the\n\u201clesser-evil principle\u201d). So, for instance, we might deny\nthat a person is responsible for choosing to injure another to avoid\nbeing killed, but hold her responsible if she chooses to kill someone\nto avoid being injured herself. Though this principle is intuitively\nplausible, we clearly do not accept it in other, non-coercive\ncontexts. For instance, we do not permit one to snatch a spare kidney\nfrom one individual to save the life of another. Although we might add\nconditions to this test to make the limitation of one\u2019s\nresponsibility harder to obtain, and therefore more in line with our\nintuitions, it remains unclear that there is any widely-accepted moral\nprinciple of this sort that would cover all cases equally well.\n\nInstead of a moral test, one might propose a psychological test, on\nwhich acquiescing to a coercer\u2019s demands in a way that harms\nothers is justified if the net value of doing so is sufficiently great\nto the coercee. Roughly speaking, this is Feinberg\u2019s approach,\ntaken up by Murray and Dudrick as well. (See Feinberg 1986; and Murray\nand Dudrick 1995.) The point of such a standard is to recognize that\nsome pressures on the will are too much to bear, without implying that\nin such cases it is literally impossible for the coercee to make\nchoices because of an overborne will. The difficulty with this\napproach is that it lets the degree of inducement alone justify\none\u2019s yielding to it. A number of causes other than coercion can\ncreate extreme inducements to do harm to others; consider what some\nhave done for fame, wealth, or love. Because most would be reluctant\nto accept that even extraordinarily tempting offers limit one\u2019s\nresponsibility for yielding to them, the magnitude of the inducement\nby itself seems not to suffice to explain our judgments of\nresponsibility. Although we might add other conditions to restrict the\nlimiting effect on responsibility exclusively to threats and not\noffers, if the justification lies in the pressure on the will, then it\nwould seem one might have the same justification for yielding to\ntemptation that one has for acquiescing to a mortal threat. (Note that\nsome tempting offers have life or death riding on them.)\n\nLaw is sometimes required to make judgments about actions performed\nunder necessity due to exigent circumstances. Sometimes persons harm\nthe interests of others in order to save themselves or others from\ndeath or serious injury from causes beyond their\n control.[22]\n Coercion, however, presents a more complicated set of issues for\nmaking judgments of responsibility than do cases of natural necessity.\nCoercion involves a strategic and dynamic interaction between two\nagents \u2014 coercer and coercee \u2014 and the standard used to\njudge the coercee\u2019s responsibility for acting under coercion can\naffect that strategic situation. The principles by which we judge a\ncoercee\u2019s responsibility for acquiescing to coercion may affect\nwhether it is rational or productive for a would-be coercer to attempt\ncoercion in the first place. (By comparison, in cases of bad luck and\nnatural disaster, the situation is simpler because the behavior of the\nweather, unlike the behavior of coercers, is unaffected by the\nincentives facing those who might be pressured into acting under its\npower.) If we are permissive in limiting the responsibility of\ncoercees, this will make acquiescing to coercion a more reasonable\noption; if instead we are stingy in limiting responsibility for harms\ncaused under coercion, coercees may be much less likely to acquiesce\nto a coercer\u2019s threats. But if a (would-be) coercer knows that a\npotential victim will be unyielding to his threats, then coercion\nbecomes a less productive or reasonable means to use. So in choosing a\nprinciple that justifies coercees in acquiescing under coercion, we\nneed to take into account that this principle may alter the dynamic\nbetween coercer and coercee in ways that may in turn affect the\nrationality and fruitfulness of using coercion.\n\nThere are, however, some cases in which coercion may alter an\nagent\u2019s responsibility for what happens as a result of coercion\nthat don\u2019t raise the difficulties with justifications noted\nabove. If, like some older ideas about coercion, we count uses of\ndirect physical interference among the means of coercion \u2014\nthrough restraint, incapacitation, or denial of essential means to\nachieve a purpose \u2014 then in some cases it is comparatively easy\nto see how coercion can provide an individual an excuse for things\ndone or not done because of coercion (See Anderson 2010). Relying on\nthe principle of \u201cought implies can,\u201d when one cannot do\nsomething, this provides a good excuse for why one is not responsible\nfor failing to do it. Related questions may arise about how one came\nto be incapacitated; for instance, if one fails to care for\none\u2019s children, and seeks to be excused for this neglect because\none was incarcerated, we may want to know why one was incarcerated\nbefore crediting the excuse. Nonetheless, there will be some cases\nwhere the answers to these questions will show that the coercee played\nno role in his own incapacitation, and is therefore not to be held\nresponsible for things the coercer caused him to do or not do.\n\nSimilarly, it is worth noting that there are some cases in which\ncoercees may be justified, and not just excused, for acquiescing to\nthreats, even if they do so calmly and deliberately. This sort of\njustification can be granted when the coercer has structured a\ncoercee\u2019s situation in such a way that the coercee\u2019s will\nbecomes essentially redundant to the outcome. If, for instance, a\nbouncer is able to remove a patron from the bar whether she likes it\nor not, then if the bouncer threatens to do so, her walking out of the\nbar in response to such a threat may be regarded as no more voluntary\nthan her being carried out by force. When a coercer has the power to\nenforce his decision regardless of what the coercee chooses to do,\nthis may provide the coercee a justification for failing to engage in\nan exercise in\n futility.[23]\n Generalizing this situation somewhat, Stephen Galoob and Erin Sheley\nargue that in contexts where a coercer has \u201ccoercive\ncontrol\u201d over a someone, such as in a long-term violent and\nabusive relationship, if such a coercer directs the coercee to act\nunlawfully, the criminal law should allow a legal defense for actions\nunder the influence of such control. \u201cA defendant should be\nentitled to a coercion-based defense when the coercer has usurped the\ntarget\u2019s decisional authority\u2014that is, when the coercer\nhas usurped control over the target\u2019s decision about what to\ndo\u201d (Galoob and Sheley 2021, 314).\n\nAn additional wrinkle with respect to responsibility under coercion\narises in cases sometimes referred to as involving \u201cthird-party\ncoercion\u201d: where X coerces Y to consent to something that Z does\nto Y. For instance, a patient might consent to a medical procedure\nunder pressure from family members (assuming such pressure rises to a\nlevel that qualifies as coercion), or a person might consent to have\nsex with someone due to threats of harm from an third party\nunconnected to the person who receives her consent. While it is\ngenerally agreed that a coercer\u2019s threats invalidate any consent\nthat the coercee might give to subsequent actions by the coercer, in\nthird-party cases the consent is given to action by a bystander with\nrespect to the coercion. Issues here may involve the extent to which\nthe third-party is aware (or should be aware) of the coercee\u2019s\nsituation, the question of what action by the third-party would most\nbenefit the coercee, and whether the third party seeks to take\nadvantage of the coercee\u2019s situation. Such cases have only\nrecently received focused attention by philosophers, such as Joseph\nMillum and Mollie Gerver, though issues of this sort have been\nidentified in applied ethics and in the context of international and\nhumanitarian aid for some time (Millum 2014, Gerver 2021).\n3.3 Coercion, freedom, and voluntariness\n\nSome choices are said to be made freely, others unfreely, or\ninvoluntarily. More generally, people may be said to live more freely\nor less freely, depending on facts such as the range and quality of\nchoices open to them, the extent to which they are immune to\ninterference from outside powerful parties, or the extent to which\nthey can pursue options of deep significance to them.\nAutonomy seems to be a special type of freedom which, insofar\nas it differs from the above types, is used to refer to an inner state\nof orderly self-directedness. Coercion has been thought to be inimical\nto at least some of these types of freedom, perhaps all, and also to\nhave deleterious impacts on the special type we call autonomy.\n\nIf coercion includes uses of direct force against a person\u2019s\nbody, it is clear enough how it can constrain most kinds of freedom\n(though not necessarily how it can affect autonomy). But as Aquinas\nlong ago noted, it\u2019s unclear why coercion in the form of threats\nshould be thought to be in tension with freedom. As Craig Carr puts\nthe worry, \u201cif at least some instances of coercion involve\nmaking choices, and if being able to make one\u2019s own choices is\npart of what it means to be free, in what sense (if any) is coercion\nantithetical to freedom?\u201d (Carr 1988, 59). Certainly many\ninstances of coercion make one\u2019s choices less appealing than\nthey would be otherwise, or reduce the quality of the compossible\noptions one has available. But it does sound somewhat odd to say that\none is less free just because one\u2019s choices have become less\nappealing, or some options for action have fallen off the menu of\nchoices. Is there a sense we can give to the claim that one is less\nfree because of coercion?\n\nLet us consider first a type of freedom associated with the range and\nquality of actions open to a person. One gets an intuitive idea of\nthis sort of freedom in comparing the situation of a prison inmate to\nthat of someone outside prison. Someone confined to a cell around the\nclock has less freedom than does someone who is able to move about as\nshe wills, interact with others in a variety of ways, and choose from\na broad variety of activities (at least if she has available\nsufficient means to pursue them). We might be tempted to say that the\nunincarcerated person has more and better choices of\nactions. But several difficulties get in the way of making such a\ncomparison precise. We lack a precise way to enumerate actions, which\nseems necessary if we are to count them or compare their number. The\nincarcerated and unincarcerated both have indeterminately many\ndifferent things they can do, each can do only perform some small\nrange of those actions at any one time. (It\u2019s even likely that\nthe incarcerated person can do some things the unincarcerated person\n can\u2019t.[24])\n So it is probably more helpful to focus on the greater quality and\ndesirability of the actions open to the unincarcerated person. Being\nconfined to a jail cell takes away one\u2019s freedom at least in\npart because it denies one the necessary means to pursue many other\nactivities that would ordinarily be desirable. But we also have no\ngood means for reckoning the value of different actions\ninterpersonally. So even this comparison is hard to make in a robust,\ndefensible\n fashion.[25]\n\nWith some threats, it seems an interpersonal comparison is\nunnecessary. When the gunman demands one\u2019s money or one\u2019s\nlife, one goes from being able to have both to being unable to have\nboth. What were compossible goods have now become incompossible, and a\nvaluable option (e.g., keeping one\u2019s money) has become\nessentially foreclosed. So freedom is decreased (Day 1977, 259).\n\nFocusing locally on the coercee\u2019s situation, such analysis seems\nreasonable enough. However, it is possible that some general threats,\nmade against a group of people, may make the individuals in the group\nmore rather than less free. Consider the threats that are part of laws\nagainst stealing. The state may threaten to jail those who steal,\nwhich (let us assume) makes it incompossible both to steal and to\nretain one\u2019s freedom. The possibility of a stable system of\nprivate property, however, would seem to depend on the existence of\nsuch laws which prohibit the wanton expropriation of the goods of\nothers. If such a regime is in fact valuable, then the threat to\nincarcerate thieves may both reduce people\u2019s freedom with\nrespect to one sort of action (by making stealing incompossible with\nremaining unincarcerated), while enhancing it with respect to others\n(by making it possible to accumulate, use, and trade private\nproperty). For another example, notice that the ability to make\nenforceable contracts with others greatly enhances one\u2019s\nabilities to gain through cooperation, but that it relies precisely on\nthe fact that contracting parties give up certain seemingly\ncompossible benefits (say, gaining the goods of another while failing\nto fulfill one\u2019s half of the bargain).\n\nCraig Carr suggests that we can grapple with the complexities here by\nnoticing that many social interactions are regulated by conventions\nthat arise from particular sorts of interpersonal relationships. So,\nfor instance, a sports team is managed by a coach, who may\n\u201cthreaten\u201d to pull a player out of the game unless he\nsticks to the game plan. But this threat does not, we may agree,\nlessen the player\u2019s freedom in any interesting sense (Carr 1988,\n62). Given the nature of sports, the roles of players and coaches, and\nthe necessity of organization in making the team and sport possible,\nCarr suggests that when such threats are licensed by the appropriate\nconventions, then there is no reason to suppose that they impinge on\nfreedom. It may be difficult in many cases to decide just what\nconventions are appropriate and controlling in a situation, but it\nseems reasonable to suppose that something like Carr\u2019s analysis\nis helpful in understanding the relationship between threats and\nfreedom in conventional contexts.\n\nSerena Olsaretti argues for the importance of a distinction between\nacting freely and acting voluntarily, and holds that while\n(successful) coercion may not in fact affect a coercee\u2019s freedom\n(if, say, a coercer is bluffing), it always affects their potential to\nact voluntarily. On her analysis, the extent of a person\u2019s\nfreedom is determined by their actual possibilities for\naction, while whether they act voluntarily depends on whether\nthe agent\u2019s actual action is acceptable to the agent. \u201cA\nchoice is voluntary if and only if it is not made because there is no\nacceptable alternative to it. Conversely, a claim that a person was\nforced to do x (she did x non-voluntarily) means that she did x\nbecause she had no acceptable alternative to it\u201d (Olsaretti\n2004, 139). Because credible threats make alternatives to the\ncoercer\u2019s desired activity unacceptable to the coercee, they\nvitiate the voluntariness of the coercee\u2019s acquiescence, and\namount to \u201cforcing\u201d the coercee to act as they do. Seeing\nsuch choices as forced whether or not unfree, Olsaretti argues, shows\nimportant similarities between coerced choices and other situations in\nwhich people\u2019s choices are forced, such as in certain market\nconditions.\n\nThere\u2019s a different way of thinking about freedom that is\npolitical in nature. This is the way of thinking that some (e.g.,\nPettit 1996) have associated with civic republicanism, in which\nfreedom amounts to being undominated by another agent. One is\ndominated by another if it is continually possible for another party\nto step in and impose his will on one\u2019s choices (even if the\ndominant party rarely finds it useful to do so). Freedom from\ndomination differs from the previous sort in that one who is subject\nto the domination of another may in fact have a wide variety of\nvaluable choices open to her. The sense in which she is unfree is that\nher choices must always be made with an eye towards retaining the\nfavor of those in a position to interfere with her choices.\nConversely, one may be undominated by anyone else, yet lack (for\nvarious reasons) many of the different valuable options that might be\navailable to some who are highly subject to the power of others (e.g.,\nadolescent children of wealthy parents, or prisoners in\nminimum-security facilities).\n\nGarnett\u2019s \u201ceudaimonistic\u201d understanding of coercion\nfollows this line, holding that \u201cwhat matters fundamentally for\ncoercion is whether, in acting, one\u2019s will is subject to,\ndetermined by, or under the control of the will of another, and not\nwhether one\u2019s prospective actions are blocked by the actions of\nanother\u201d (Garnett 2018, 554). He contrasts this understanding of\n\u201cfreedom-as-nonsubjection\u201d to\n\u201cfreedom-as-nonprevention,\u201d holding that there is a\ndistinct good that involves not being subjected to interference by\nothers, independently of whether this amounts to domination. Notably,\nGarnett holds that such subjection can be found in some cases of\noffers, where the offeror takes advantage of the offeree\u2019s lack\nof an acceptable alternative.\n\nCoercion is one method by which a powerful agent can exercise and\nmaintain his dominance over another. When one has the power needed to\ncredibly threaten another, one can use that power to impose\none\u2019s will on her regarding many choices (Anderson 2010). This\npower may give one the ability to dominate another in Pettit\u2019s\nsense, since it can be used arbitrarily to alter or constrain\nanother\u2019s activities, even if it is in fact used only rarely. If\none\u2019s threats are sufficiently credible, and if meeting\none\u2019s demands is not devastating in itself, one may be able to\nleverage one\u2019s powers to influence many of the activities of\nothers, while only rarely being required to expend one\u2019s powers\nin enforcement. Malignant governments and mafias are frequently able\nto maintain control over sizeable populations through threats and\nintimidation, though they may only infrequently interfere directly in\nthe activities of others. If one\u2019s powers and wishes are well\nenough known through past demonstrations, one may even be able to\navoid making many overt threats while still getting one\u2019s\nway.\n\nThis raises a question about whether the use of coercion requires or\nimplies that the coercer is in a position of dominance over the\ncoercee. While most would likely accept that one can coerce without\nhaving such dominance, this may be a rarer and more curious scenario\nthan it at first appears. It is true that virtually anyone can state a\nclaim that has the form of a threat against another, and it is also\ntrue that many agents can issue credible threats that are nonetheless\nbluffs \u2014 that is, can threaten without possessing the power that\nis advertised. Nonetheless, the possibility and usefulness of issuing\nthreats depends in general on the likelihood that such threats can be\nexecuted successfully, without the coercer suffering a cost comparable\nto that of the coercee. Also, it would seem that for coercion to be\npossible, one must be in a position to do more than trivial damage to\nthe coercee\u2019s interests; otherwise, one might be said to use\ncoercion when one threatens, e.g., to quit one\u2019s minimum-wage\nfast-food job if one\u2019s employer doesn\u2019t raise one\u2019s\nwage to match what one could make at the restaurant across the street.\nMoreover, coercers frequently need to craft and adapt their threats to\nthe specific vulnerabilities of the coercee. Gideon Yaffe has nicely\nexpressed this aspect of the relationship between the coercer\u2019s\npower and their ability to affect one\u2019s freedom:\n\nThe key to the explanation for the freedom-undermining force of\ncoercion is that, as a general rule, coercers don\u2019t merely\nproduce, but also track, the compliance of their victims. \u2026\n[T]he coercer is rarely attached to the particular nasty consequence\nthat he threatens; with some limits, he is ready to bring about\nwhatever consequences would serve to bring the victim around to\ncompliance (Yaffe 2003).\n\n\nIf a coercer lacks the power needed to do these things, it may be\nirrational for the coercer to execute his threat if defied, and hence\nfrequently irrational for the coercee to accede to it. So unless the\ncoercer or coercee is irrational (and the other perceives him as\nsuch), or unless one is deceived about the other\u2019s relative\npower (or rationality), coercion requires some significant\ndifferential in power between coercer and coercee for it, in general,\nto be a rational, useful technique. So even if a just state does not\ndominate its citizens in Pettit\u2019s sense of exercising its power\nover them arbitrarily, it still must be capable of such dominance if\nit is to be able to keep order against those who would otherwise defy\nits commands. (For related arguments and an analysis of domination as\nthe \u201cimpositional power\u201d to impose one\u2019s will\narbitrarily on another, see McCammon 2015.)\n3.4 Political/legal theory and coercion\n\nAs the historical section of this entry suggests, the relationship\nbetween states, law, and coercion has been a subject of vast\ndiscussion throughout Western philosophical history. Many of the most\npressing issues belong to a discussion of states and law rather than\nto a discussion of\n coercion.[26]\n However, some theorists have attempted to draw some fairly\nrevisionist lessons about politics and law from their theoretical\ndiscussions of coercion. This work is worth consideration here, since\ntheir conclusions may impact how we understand the nature of coercion,\nand its place in law and politics.\n3.4.1 The coerciveness of law\n\nAs noted above, there are a number of accounts of coercion that insist\nthat coercion is a violation of right, or otherwise normatively\ndefective, of which Alan Wertheimer\u2019s Coercion is the\nmost prominent. But if coercion is necessarily immoral action, then it\nis hard to explain how an act of coercion could count as\n justified.[27]\n Among other implications, this view is in apparent contradiction with\nthe traditional approach to coercion which treats states as\nparadigmatically, even necessarily users of coercion. As William\nEdmundson has pointed out (and as Nozick 1969, had noticed), if the\nstate is justified in punishing wrongdoers, then when it threatens to\ndo so, it does not threaten to make them worse off than they ought to\nbe (Edmundson 1995 and 1998, chs. 4\u20136). Hence on an approach to\ncoercion that insists it is immoral activity, the state\u2019s use of\npolice powers to enforce the law is not coercive.\n\nCould this be right? It hinges, first, on whether one accepts a\nmoralized analysis of coercion; if one can give a non-moralized\naccount of coercion, then the grounds for the claim are much more\ntenuous. It would also seem to depend on whether the moral evaluation\nof the coercer\u2019s action is an \u201call things\nconsidered\u201d judgment, or merely a pro tanto one. While\nthe government\u2019s use of coercion may be all-things-considered\nmorally benign, the threat of jailing someone may count as pro\ntanto wrong in a way that, say, paying a reward is not. If so,\nthen even on a moralized account we may suppose that government\ncoercion requires special justification before it can be accepted.\nWertheimer, Haksar, Lamond, and Oberdiek, for instance, seem to find\nno problem accepting that there is \u201cjustified coercion\u201d\n\u2014 that is, acts which are coercive on a moralized theory of\ncoercion (baseline or otherwise), yet which are ultimately justified\nby other considerations (Oberdiek 1976; Haksar 1976; Wertheimer 1987;\nand Lamond 2000 and 2001). Edmundson, however, argues that such a view\nis unmotivated and not required by a moralized theory, properly\nunderstood. If he is right, then the uses of what are normally thought\nof as coercive techniques do not call for special scrutiny if they are\nconstrained to the support of just, procedurally sound law.\n\nEdmundson\u2019s criticism of the canonical view of the state as\ncoercive reveals a deeper root to some disagreements over coercion. In\neffect, Edmundson provides a reason to question how special or\nimportant coercion really is. Coercion may make some actions\nnecessary, but human beings in any natural world will be constrained\nby necessities of many sorts: the physical limits of our bodies in our\nenvironments, and our needs for things such as nourishment, shelter,\nprotection, and even perhaps community, recognition, and love. To be\ncoerced adds to or alters in some ways what it is necessary for one to\ndo. But being subject to a coercive set of laws might also provide one\ngreater opportunities or freedom from necessity, as arguably the\ncriminal law does, at least if well-drafted and\n enforced.[28]\n If just laws provide us protection from wrong-doers while leaving us\nat liberty to take any morally justifiable act (assuming here that the\ncriminal law prohibits only unjust acts), then the law\u2019s\nthreatened use of force against lawbreakers may not merit any special\nscrutiny. We might instead regard it as a shifting, regularization,\nand rationalization of the necessities to which human beings are\nanyways subject. Edmundson and those he disputes with can all agree\nthat coercion used for illicit ends is a matter of moral significance\nand a cause for special scrutiny and opposition. What Edmundson shows\nis that moralized approaches to coercion make it hard to see why the\ntechnique itself and the agents who can use it are especially worthy\nof our attention.\n\nOne might thus object to moralized accounts on the grounds that we\nhave reason to track and scrutinize uses of this technique whether\nperformed well or badly, justly or unjustly. This is because when an\nagent has the power to coerce willy nilly, as the state does, it is up\nto such an agent to decide what purposes it will use its powers for.\nNatural necessities are typically predictable, stable requirements on\nour actions, persisting without regard to us as individuals. By\ncontrast, powerful agents are not necessarily predictable, stable, or\nindifferent to us as individuals. Rather, they can target and direct\ntheir powers to suit their purposes. Of course we hope that they are\nconstrained by justice, but even mostly just governments are likely to\nenact bad laws or have rogue elements within them. Hence there is\nvalue in having a concept to pick out the sort of technique used in\nlaw enforcement, forced migrations, mafia protection rackets,\nback-alley robbery, and the training of some recalcitrant children,\nsince one and the same state might use the same tools and techniques\nto engage any or all of these sorts of activities, with only the whim\nof the leader or parliament to decide which it shall be.\n\nA slightly less radical, though still revisionist claim about the\ncoerciveness of law, holds that the coerciveness of law resides in its\nclaim to a right to use (or authorize the use of) enforcement power.\nDrawing a distinction between the state and its apparatuses on the one\nhand, and the law on the other, Grant Lamond argues that the\ncoerciveness of law should not be thought to depend on the fact that\nthe state has such things as police departments and prisons as its\nenforcement mechanisms. Rather, he argues that the coerciveness of law\nresides in its claim to a \u201cright to authorize the\nenforcement of [its subjects duties, responsibilities,\netc.]\u2026 It is not that legal duties are sanction-based, nor that\nevery law must ultimately be linked to coercive measures, but that law\nclaims the right to back up its directives with force\u201d\n(Lamond 2001, 55). He later clarifies this view to point out that the\nlaw claims indeterminate authority to enforce its\ndictates.\n\nLamond\u2019s aim in making this distinction is to clarify what he\nsees to be several possible confusions. First, he argues that the\nlaw\u2019s coerciveness need not depend directly on the state\u2019s\nown enforcement apparatus; the state might use vigilantes, private\ncontractors, or other private means for this\n function.[29]\n Moreover, he aims to limit law\u2019s responsibility for coercive\nacts to just those that it in fact authorizes: extra-legal uses of\ncoercion by the state should not be chalked up to law\u2019s\ncoerciveness. He also argues that some of the coercive enforcements\nthat law uses are not themselves uses of force; instead, one might\nconfiscate bank accounts or take away rights in non-tangible property\n(such as intellectual property protections) as means to pressure\nsubjects to comply with the law. Lamond holds that if such\ninterventions exert sufficient pressure on the will of those\nconsidering a particular option, such that they change course, then\nthey may be counted as coercive, even if they do not involve the\nthreat or imposition of sanctions conditioned on the activities of the\npeople governed (Lamond 2000, 56\u201357). Lastly, like Edmundson, he\naims to downplay the supposed role that coercion plays in our\nappreciation of the law, holding that many of law\u2019s functions do\nnot depend specifically on its function of authorizing (or not\nauthorizing) enforcements on the subjects. \u201cIt is easy to\nexaggerate the role of coercion in maintaining the efficacy of the\nlegal system, and to overestimate its capacity to sustain\nefficacy\u201d (Lamond 2001, 57).\n\nLamond\u2019s claim about law\u2019s coerciveness stems from a\nnumber of considerations, but undoubtedly one is his understanding of\nthe nature of coercion itself, which was discussed in Section 2.5\nabove. Whether or not his account of coercion is tenable, what Lamond\nsays about why law is coercive generates independent difficulties.\nEven if the law claims to authorize the enforcement of its\nsubjects\u2019 duties, it is not clear why the mere claiming\nof such authorization would suffice to make the claiming coercive. The\nlaws of a state may well provide for and instruct agencies or\nmechanisms to serve as its enforcers (e.g., police, vigilantes, or\nrobots); but if these enforcers quit, or are bought/killed/shut off,\nthe coerciveness of the law will quickly evaporate. If, for instance,\nthe army decides to side with the protestors rather than the\ngovernment, the law loses its force in a hurry, no matter how\nlegitimate. Moreover, were a private association or other institution\nto \u201clay claim\u201d to use such indeterminately bounded\nenforcement powers, what would determine whether in fact they ended up\nbeing coercive is whether in fact they managed to engage in\nenforcement activities through agencies or mechanisms similar to those\nthat states regularly use, or so Lucas points out. (Lucas 1966,\n61\u20132) A church, for instance, might even leverage its threats\nwith claims about the final disposition of one\u2019s mortal soul.\nBut this sort of claim to reward and punish does not give the church\nthe ability to coerce, at least as this concept is usually understood\nin political contexts.\n\nSome have argued directly that law does not require coercive backing\nin order to count as law (e.g., Raz 1975), holding that what is\ninstead important is that law is made by the appropriate authority\n(see also Oberdiek 1976). Going further than this, Robert Hughes\nargues that there can be laws a state is entitled to make but not\nentitled to enforce. \u201cWhether a government is entitled to\nenforce any given legal restriction coercively depends on concrete\nempirical facts, not only on abstract truisms about human nature, and\non moral features of the restriction in question\u201d (Hughes 2013,\n184). Such empirical factors on Hughes\u2019 account include whether\ncompliance can be obtained through non-coercive means, and what the\ncosts of using coercion to secure compliance would be. Responding to\nJoseph Raz, Edmundson, and Lamonde, inter alia, Ekow Yankah\ndefends the traditional view connecting law and coercion, contending\nthat \u201cLegal norms must be ultimately enforceable by coercion to\nbe included in the core concept of the law\u201d (Yankah 2008, 1198).\nAfter developing his own non-moralized conception of coercion, Yankah\nargues that law requires not only authority but the ability to compel\nobedience. There are, after all, many different possible normative\nsystems, for example religious ones, that claim to have moral\nauthority to command obedience, but law is distinctive among them\nbecause it has the possibility to compel compliance with the edicts of\njustified authorities. Countering Raz\u2019s view that coercion might\nbe merely instrumentally needed, Yankah asserts, \u201cthe inability\nof any structure to even theoretically compel [a lawbreaker] to obey\nwould cast serious doubt on the system\u2019s claim to be the\nlaw\u201d (Yankah, 2008, 1236; for others on this side of the dispute\nsee Himma 2016 and Woodbury-Smith 2020).\n3.4.2 The coerciveness of states\n\nMoving from the question of how law relates to coercion to the broader\nquestion of how states and politics more generally relate to coercion,\nthere are a number of ways that political theory addresses the role of\ncoercion as a tool of statecraft, and offers arguments about how\ncoercion conditions the scope and legitimacy of political action. Max\nWeber famously defined the state in terms of its legitimate\nmonopolization of physical coercive force within a territory:\n\n\nA political organisation will be called a \u201cruling\norganisation\u201d to the extent that its existence and the validity\nof its orders can be continually guaranteed within a given\ngeographical area by the application and threat of physical coercion\nby an administrative staff. An institutionally organised political\nenterprise (Anstaltsbetrieb) will be called a state if, and\nto the extent that, its administrative staff can lay claim to a\nmonopoly of legitimate physical force in the execution of its orders\n(Weber 2019 [1921], \u00a717, 135\u2013136; See also Weber 1946\n[1921]).\n\n\nLiberals, broadly construed, have been impressed with the power of the\nstate and its potential both for misuse as well as partisan domination\nover and sectarian interference with dissenters, and thus have\nidentified its employment of coercion as generating a distinctive set\nof political concerns. For instance, G. E. M. Anscombe argues that if\nstates are to be distinguished from mafias, it is only because they\nmay, if well ordered, earn authority over their subjects, which she\nunderstands as \u201ca right to be obeyed\u201d (Anscombe 1981,\n132). Judith Shklar, in her \u201cLiberalism of Fear,\u201d draws\nattention to the distinctiveness and historical rarity of the modern\nliberal state as one in which the power of the government is\nconstrained by foreswearing the use of cruelty and fear as tools of\nstatecraft (Shklar 1989). Others, such as Charles Larmore and Gerald\nGaus, take coercion to be a distinctively problematic interpersonal\nimposition. Hence, because states are understood to be the\npreeminently coercive agents, the justification of the state depends\nin significant part on whether there is sufficient justification for\nits use of coercion to secure compliance with its decisions (see\nLarmore 1996, ch. 6; Gaus 2003).\n\nEchoing Weber, in A Theory of Justice, Rawls distinguishes\nthe \u201clegal system\u201d of a state by \u201cits comprehensive\nscope and its regulative powers with respect to other associations.\nThe constitutional agencies that it defines generally have the\nexclusive legal right to at least the more extreme forms of coercion.\nThe kinds of duress that private associations can employ are strictly\nlimited\u201d (Rawls 1999 [1971], 207), and \u201cBy enforcing a\npublic system of penalties government removes the grounds for thinking\nthat others are not complying with the rules. For this reason alone, a\ncoercive sovereign is presumably always necessary, even though in a\nwell-ordered society sanctions are not severe and may never need to be\nimposed\u201d (Rawls 1999 [1971], 211). In his later Justice as\nFairness: A Restatement, he regards coercion as an intrinsic\nfeature of state political activity: \u201cPolitical power is always\ncoercive power applied by the state and its apparatus of\nenforcement\u201d (Rawls 2001, 40). He goes so far as to suggest that\nif people in a society could attain their goods harmoniously, without\nresorting to private coercion or relying on public coercion to resolve\nconflicts, it would be \u201ca society in a certain sense beyond\njustice. It has eliminated the occasions when the appeal to the\nprinciples of right and justice is necessary\u201d (Rawls 1999\n[1971], 249). Rawls goes on to argue for the importance of justice as\nthe primary regulative virtue of the basic structure and institutions\nthat determine the distribution of benefits and burdens to members of\nsociety (Rawls 1999 [1971], 4).\n\nAlthough Rawls does not offer a detailed explication or defense of his\nunderstanding of coercion, due to the outsized influence of his\npolitical theory, his thinking about the place of coercion in politics\nhas set the terms for several debates in this area. One issue that\nbears the distinctive mark of his thinking is whether and why the\nprincipal object of justice is the basic structure of a society, and\nhow that structure should be delimited. Expressed in terms somewhat\nless specific to Rawls, we may query whether the state is distinctly a\nuser of coercion, and what difference this might make to the question\nof its activities should be regulated. Another area for inquiry\nconsiders whether there are special limits to a state\u2019s use of\ncoercion, and/or whether it needs to meet some special condition for\nits justification (for this way of structuring the concerns here, see\nKolodny 2017 and 2018). Some, following Rawls, argue that some form of\npublic justification that speaks to all reasonable members of society\nis required to justify the state\u2019s use of coercion; others\nreject this requirement, while supporting other grounds of\njustification instead. And still others hold that the state\u2019s\nuse of coercion does not require distinctive justification or need to\nbe limited to only a specific range of purposes. A third line of\ninquiry asks whether there are implications from the state\u2019s use\nof coercive power for determining the scope of the obligations of\njustice. Some, again following Rawls, hold that because members of a\nsingle polity are mutually subject to the power of coercion that they\nmaterially facilitate, they have distinctive obligations of\ndistributive justice to one another that do not apply to those not\nsimilarly part of the same polity. Others object to this argument on a\nnumber of grounds.\n3.4.3 Are states distinctively coercive?\n\nThe first set of inquiries here concerns whether the state\u2019s\ncoercive activities are distinctively coercive, compared to other\nsocial institutions and practices. One reason Rawls offers for\napplying his principles of justice to the \u201cbasic\nstructure\u201d of society (which includes such things as the\npolitical constitution, the major social institutions and practices\nthat structure human relationships, such as the family) is\n\u201cbecause its effects are so profound and present from the\nstart\u201d (Rawls 1999 [1971], 7). While it appears clear that the\nstate, via its coercive determination of law and institutions like the\neconomic system, constitutes much of the \u201cbasic\nstructure,\u201d it is hardly the only source of profound\nconstraining effects on the lives of its subjects. This point is\npressed by G. A. Cohen, who argues regarding Rawls\u2019s principles\nof justice that their application should not be limited to just those\nparts of the \u201cbasic structure\u201d of society that are the\noutgrowth of the state\u2019s coercive institutions. Cohen then\nargues that a social institution such as the structure of the family\nis something that is largely determined by conventional social\npractices rather than by the coercively-backed laws of the state. Yet\nfew aspects of a society\u2019s structure will have more profound\neffects on the life prospects and possibilities for action than the\nway family structures are organized. Since these are not defined by\nthe state\u2019s coercive apparatus (or so Cohen suggests),\nthere\u2019s no reason why the principles of justice should be\nlimited to regulating just the parts of the social structure that owes\nits existence to the state\u2019s coercive impetus (Cohen 1997).\nWhether or not one holds that the social structures one is born into,\nsuch as a particular set of family arrangements, count as coercive,\ntheir structure is largely outside the bounds of the state coercive\nenforcement, even though they constrain choice and possibility in a\nway little different from state coercive decisions.\n\nWhile accepting that the family, in some of its aspects, should be\ncounted within the \u201cbasic structure\u201d and thus is\naccountable to principles of justice, Blain Neufeld argues that there\nis good reason to restrict concern with social justice to just those\nsocial institutions that are \u201corganized and maintained through\nthe collective exercise of coercive power\u201d (Neufeld 2009, p.\n37). The state\u2019s use of power is distinctive in two ways: it is\nan activity of the whole collective body, so requires justification to\nall of those who are part of that body. And the whole of that society\nis subject to it; it is normally very difficult or impossible for\nindividuals to exempt themselves from a state\u2019s coercive\njurisdiction. The use of coercion here is not arbitrary, since the\nfunctioning of these public institutions depends on their being able\nto provide assurance to society\u2019s members that everyone will be\nsubject to the same terms and obligations, and that their\ncontributions and cooperation will be reciprocated by others (Neufeld\n2009, 43). While other social institutions in a well-ordered society,\nsuch as religions or cultural institutions, may have profound effects\nof many members of a society, it remains possible for individual to\nreject their authority and jurisdiction. Hence they are\n\u201cvoluntary\u201d associations in a way that the state is not\n(Neufeld 2009, 42).\n\nNeufeld, following Susan Moller Okin (See Okin 1994 and 2005), argues\nthat in Rawls\u2019 later writings he treats the structure of the\nfamily in particular as more like one of these voluntary associations,\nrather than properly part of the basic structure, and so does not fall\nwithin the scope of principles of justice. However, Neufeld points out\nthat in contemporary liberal states there are a wide range of coercive\nlaws and state-organized facilities that regulate family structure and\nthe possibilities for association there, thus making it much more an\neffect of state coercive power than are religions, cultural\nassociations, and many other forms of private association. Thus the\nstate is more directly implicated in the structure of the family than\nRawls or Cohen seem to register. (See here also Brake 2012 for the\nways in which state power constitutes legal marriage.)\n3.4.4 Does state coercion need special justification?\n\nA different aspect of Rawls\u2019 approach holds that coercion is\nitself a distinctive political activity, and distinctively in need of\njustification to the members of a polity. Rawls here accepts what\nseems to be a broadly held view that coercion is an especially\nproblematic way for one party or entity to treat another party, which,\nif right, makes the issue of how to justify its use by the state\npressing. One might ground this view in the concern Kant expresses in\nthe \u201cformula of humanity\u201d: \u201cSo act that you use\nhumanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other,\nalways at the same time as an end, never merely as a means\u201d\n(Kant 1997 [1787], AK 4:429). To coerce someone appears to be a\nparadigmatic way of overriding their own decision about what they\nshould do, and directing their will to serve one\u2019s own purposes,\nrather than purposes of their own, thus treating them solely as a\nmeans rather than as an end themselves. As Charles Larmore puts the\npoint, \u201cthe distinctive feature of persons is that they are\nbeings capable of thinking and acting on the basis of reasons. If we\ntry to bring about conformity to a political principle simply by\nthreat, we will be treating people solely as means, as objects of\ncoercion. We will not also be treating them as ends, engaging directly\ntheir distinctive capacity as persons\u201d (Larmore 1996, 137; see\nalso Pallikkathayil 2016, 174).\n\nFor this reason, many liberals hold that state coercion must be\nsubjected to some further constraint or justification that that\nexplains how at least some exercises of coercion are consistent with\ntreating those who are coerced as ends in themselves, and not merely\nmeans. Perhaps the dominant approach is one Gerald Gaus and\nChristopher J. Eberle have called \u201cjustificatory\nliberalism\u201d (which Eberle associates also with the work of\nliberals such as Rawls, Larmore, and Robert Audi) which makes the\njustification of coercion its central mission. \u201cThe claim that\nrespect requires public justification provides a basis for the central\ncomponent of the justificatory liberal\u2019s ethic of citizenship:\nthe norm of respect imposes an obligation on each citizen to\ndiscipline herself in such a way that she resolutely refrains from\nsupporting any coercive law for which she cannot provide the requisite\npublic justification\u201d (Eberle 2002, 12, emphasis omitted; see\nalso Gaus 2010).\n\nThere is now a very large literature, arising out of\nRawls-interpretive scholarship, attempting and criticizing this\njustificatory task, which extends well beyond the issues raised by\nstate coercion; this entry is not suited to address it in any detail.\n(See instead the Stanford Encyclopedia entries on\n\u201cPublic Reason,\u201d \u201cPublic Justification,\u201d\n\u201cLiberalism\u201d and \u201cPolitical Legitimacy.\u201d) But\nrelevant here are some rebuttal arguments that reject or qualify the\nclaim that the state\u2019s use of coercion is especially in need of\nsuch justification. Several authors have argued that state uses of\ncoercion are not necessarily problematic in a way that encumbers them\nwith a special justificatory burden, or at least not a burden that is\nowed to those subjected to state coercion.\n\nIn response to the presumption against state coercion that motivates\nthe liberal justificatory projects, Andrew Lister raises a number of\nobjections to such a presumption (Lister 2010). While Lister\nacknowledges that paternalistic uses of coercion\u2014aimed at the\nwell-being of those coerced\u2014would be hard to justify against\nthose whose choices are overridden for their own good, he argues that\nother exercises of state coercion may be more defensible than the\n\u201creasonable rejectability\u201d test would seem to allow. He\nargues that although there may be disagreements based in publicly\nacceptable reasons about whether a particular use of coercion may be\nwarranted or desirable, a polity\u2019s citizens might reasonably\nagree to accept, say, authorizing a government to enact a set of\ncoercive policies (which may include some that some individuals would\nreject), rather than requiring that each individual policy be tested\nfor reasonable rejectability, which might result in all of them being\nrejected by someone or another. That is, it may be reasonably\nunrejectable to adopt as a compromise a process that enacts some\ncoercive state policies that are, as a package, preferred by everyone\nin comparison to a situation in which nearly all uses of coercion are\ndisabled by one or another party\u2019s specific reasonable objection\nto it. This solution is one Joseph Chan, developing the idea from\nThomas Nagel, calls the \u201cprinciple of higher-order\nunanimity\u201d: if people can and should unanimously agree that a\nstate must use coercion out of practical necessity, then this\nprinciple can be adopted as reasonably unrejectable, and then used to\njustify specific coercive policies even if some citizens might\nsubsequently have reasonable objections to those particular policies\n(Chan 2000, Nagel 1995).\n\nLister defends this proposal against objections from Gaus\u2019s\nliberal neutrality (Gaus 2003) that hold state coercion to be\ndistinctively problematic, and so demand that every coercive state\naction be individually vetted for reasonable rejectability. For one\nthing, Lister points out that policies that invoke state coercion may\ndiffer in their acceptability depending on what other policies are in\nplace. He offers as an illustration that it may be reasonable to favor\nstronger property rights against the state in a society with broadly\negalitarian distribution of wealth, whereas it may be more justifiable\nto allow eminent domain to override property owners\u2019 rights\nwhere there is broad inequality of ownership and little redistributive\ntaxation (Lister 2010, 158). Moreover, state coercion is often used to\ncombat private coercion, or other harms of a similarly disruptive\ncharacter; it is not obvious that we should prefer a state that allows\nprivate coercion to one that uses coercion itself against private\ncoercion. Furthermore, Lister argues, it is also unclear how to\nmeasure the extent of coercion as an output of a state\u2019s policy\nchoices, which is another obstacle to a presumption against state\ncoercion for the sake of avoiding coercion more generally.\n\nColin Bird also argues against the view that being coerced by the\nstate is a distinctive ground necessitating that coercers justify\ntheir actions to the coercees. He argues that other ways in which a\nmajority might exclude equal protection to minorities not involving\ncoercion would be similarly problematic, suggesting that the problem\nwith state coercion is not specifically due to the effect of coercion\non those coerced. For instance, if a state organized a voluntary cash\nlottery to fund some sectarian mission, making it independent of the\nuse of taxation, he argues that this would raise similar problems of\nreasonable rejectability by those whose interests are ignored by this\nprogram. Moreover, he notes that objections to coercion need not be\ndue to its effect on those coerced: people might even reasonably\nobject to a coercive policies even if they are immune to that\ncoercion, as a male might reasonably object to laws forbidding\nabortion even if he is not liable to suffer its enforcement (Bird\n2014, 198). Bird instead thinks that because the state acts on behalf\nof all of its citizens, the requirement of public justification\nattaches to its decision because they speak on behalf of everyone, and\nso should be justifiable to all as co-authors of those decisions. But\nthis then severs the need for public justification from the coercive\nquality of some of those decisions.\n\nIn a similar vein, Niko Kolodny and Christopher Morris contest the\nsignificance of the state\u2019s use of coercion to the question of\nwhether state power can be legitimate by liberalism\u2019s lights.\nKolodny registers the concerns of civic republicans that it\u2019s\nthe state\u2019s superior power to coerce that makes it suspect.\nHowever, he thinks that this is based in a misdiagnosis of the concern\nabout the state; our worry about the state would be justified even if\nthe state maintained its supremacy without the use of coercion, but\nrather just had widespread public assent to its decisions. Ultimately,\nhe holds that concern with coercion stems more from how the power of\nthe state seems to impugn the equality and self-sovereignty of the\nmembers of society, and not from any special threat it poses to the\nfreedom of its subjects (Kolodny 2016, 2017 and 2018). Morris argues\ncoercion is just one tool that states use to gain compliance with\ntheir decisions. Possessing \u201cauthority\u201d is sufficient to\ngain compliance in many decisions from at least many people, and so is\nsimilarly in need of justification if coercion is. \u201cOne does not\nunderstand law and, more generally, states if one does not see\ncoercion and force as supplementary to authority. Coercion\nand force are needed when the state\u2019s claimed authority is\nunappreciated, defective, or absent. Unjust states, recognized widely\nas such, will need to rely heavily on force; just states presumably\nneed much less force\u201d (Morris 2012, 40 (Morris\u2019\nemphasis)). On these views, then, even if state coercion requires\njustification, it isn\u2019t a distinctively important factor in need\nof special justification.\n\nLastly, Pallikkathayil argues that the question of how state coercion\ncan be justified to those coerced is wrongly posed. Developing a\nKantian approach (similar to that elaborated at greater length by\nArthur Ripstein in Ripstein 2009), Pallikkathayil argues that states\nare instituted to allow people to live their lives in association with\nothers in a way that allows all to be mutually independent through a\nsystem of rights that prevent unjust interference in one\nanother\u2019s choices. States are required in order to specify those\nrights, adjudicate claims in the breach, and enforce those judgments\nso people may rely on them. With this story as background,\nPallikkathayil asks:\n\n\n[W]hat I am doing when I coerce someone by subjecting her to liberal\npolitical institutions and laws. I am actually trying to treat her as\nindependent by putting her in the only circumstances in which she can\nbe free to live her life as she sees fit consistently with everyone\nelse doing so as well. And this remains the case even if she\nreasonably disagrees with me about the justification for the state\njust given. So, on this view, what is distinctive about permissible\ncoercion is that it is consistent with\u2014and in the case of the\nstate\u2019s use of coercion, needed for\u2014mutual independence,\nrather than that it makes contact with the viewpoints of others in a\nparticular way. (Pallikkathayil 2016, 177)\n\n\nPallikkathayil then argues that this account of the function of a\nstate, with coercion being an essential tool for it to carry out this\nfunction, has the advantage of restricting uses of state power to\nthose that facilitate or at least are compatible with this aim of\nmutual independence, while providing a justification for necessary\ncoercion that doesn\u2019t depend on the particular values of the\nsociety\u2019s members. \u201c[A]n advantage of the Kantian\u2019s\naccount of permissible coercion is that it looks to capture what is\nintuitively most problematic about impermissible coercion.\nImpermissible coercion involves trying to make a decision for another\nthat one is not entitled to make. The possibility that we might\ndisagree about what decision to make is orthogonal to this\nconcern\u201d (Pallikkathayil 2016, 183). Hence, similar to the way\nthe Nagel/Lister appeal to a principle of higher-order unanimity\nshort-cuts the need to justify specific policies involving coercion,\nPallikkathayil\u2019s Kantian approach justifies the coerciveness of\nthe state more generally, with justification of specific coercive\npolicies coming in at a subsidiary step where the use of coercion is\nalready pre-cleared, in a sense.\n3.4.5 Does state coercion generate special obligations for its citizens?\n\nThe third topic arising from Rawls\u2019 framework is the issue of\nwhether participation in a society governed by a coercive state\ngenerates distinctive obligations to co-nationals, because of that\nmutual susceptibility to coercion, or whether political obligations\nare unaffected by this mutual susceptibility. Rawls famously limited\nthe applicability of the principles of justice to the boundaries of a\nsingle polity, \u201ca closed system isolated from other\nsocieties\u201d (Rawls 1999 [1971], 7; see also Rawls 1993);\nrelations between different polities and people across borders were\ntaken to be governed according to other principles. For Rawls, the\nsubject of justice is \u201cthe major social institutions [that]\ndistribute fundamental rights and duties and determine the division of\nadvantages from social cooperation,\u201d (Rawls 1999 [1971], 6), the\nprinciples of justice apply only to those united in a society that\nforms the basis of such social cooperation.\n\nWhile this limitation has been contested, Michael Blake and Mathias\nRisse argue that it can be supported by consideration of the coercive\nnature of the state. The necessity of state coercion puts citizens of\na single state in a kind of relationship to one another that differs\nfrom their relationship to those outside their state. Blake holds that\na duty to promote economic equality as a matter of justice \u201cis a\nplausible interpretation of liberal principles only when those\nprinciples are applied to individuals who share liability to the\ncoercive network of state governance\u201d (Blake, 2002, 258). Risse\nsimilarly accepts that states (though not just states) may bear\nspecial obligations to those they govern due to their use of coercion\nover those under their authority (Risse 2006). Risse however stresses\nthat it is the immediacy of the sort of legal and political coercion\nstates exercise over their subjects that gives those subjects special\nclaim to just treatment from their states and fellow citizens.\n\nThomas Nagel reasons likewise to a similar conclusion, and extends it\nto justify the exclusion of immigrants from a state.\n\u201cImmigration policies are simply enforced against the nationals\nof other states; the laws are not imposed in their name, nor are they\nasked to accept and uphold those laws. Since no acceptance is demanded\nof them, no justification is required that explains why they should\naccept such discriminatory policies, or why their interests have been\ngiven equal consideration. It is sufficient justification to claim\nthat the policies do not violate their prepolitical human\nrights\u201d (Nagel 2005, 129\u201330). Against this view, the use\nof coercion to exclude non-citizens from a state has been argued to\nviolate basic rights (Huemer 2010) and principles of democratic theory\n(Abizadeh 2008; for objections and replies, see Miller 2009 and 2010;\nand Abizadeh 2010). As the next section will further explore, coercion\nacross state borders is also a contentious issue.\n\nIn response to positions like that of Blake, Risse, and Nagel, Andrea\nSangiovanni argues that people do not accrue special obligations to\ntheir fellow citizens just because they are mutually and\nnon-voluntarily liable to being coerced for the sake of their common\nwell-being (Sangiovanni 2012). While justice may constrain what sort\nor extent of coercive \u201cwill-bending\u201d can be justified,\nSangiovanni argues that being mutually subjected to coercion does not\nchange what obligations one has to others similarly situated. While\nnot ruling out that there may be obligations arising from being\nmembers of the same society, if such members have more demanding\nobligations to share the wealth with fellow members than with\noutsiders, this can\u2019t be explained just by their common\nsubjection to coercion. (For a reply to Sangiovanni friendly to\nBlake\u2019s position, see MacKay 2016.)\n\nFor a discussion of the sub-legal and super-legal uses of coercion in\ndomestic and international settings, see the supplementary\ndocument:\n\nApplications for Theories of Coercion\n\n",
