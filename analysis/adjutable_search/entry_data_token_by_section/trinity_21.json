    "main_text": "Four-self, No-self, and Indeterminate Self Theories || Persons as Improper Parts of God\n3.4 Persons as Improper Parts of God\n\nAn account of the Trinity by Daniel Molto tries to preserve the idea\nfound especially in Western creeds that \u201ceach divine person is,\nin some sense, all of God\u201d (2018, 395). (Because of this he\nclaims the title \u201cLatin\u201d for the theory.) He employs a\nnon-standard\n mereology\n (theory of parts and wholes) to interpret what he considers to be the\nthree requirements for a Trinity theory: that there\u2019s only one\ngod, that no Person of the Trinity is identical to any other, and that\nin some sense it is true that each Person individually \u201cis\nwholly\u201d God (400). The view is that God, the Father, the Son,\nand the Spirit are all improper parts of one another, while none is\nnumerically identical to any other. This is shown in the following\nchart; the lines represent the symmetrical and transitive improper\nparthood relation.\n\n\n\n\nOn more \u201cclassical\u201d mereological systems, if A is an\nimproper part of B, this implies that A and B are numerically\nidentical, but in the system suggested by Molto, this is denied. He\nargues that this change is not merely theologically motivated, but may\nbe applicable to other issues in metaphysics (410\u20133).\n\nMolto discusses a problem for the model which arises from the\ntransitivity of parthood and the axiom that things which are improper\nparts of one another must have all their proper parts in common. If\nthe body of the incarnate Son is a proper part of him, then given\nMolto\u2019s model of the Trinity, this body would also have to be a\nproper part of God, of the Father, and of the Holy Spirit \u2013\nclaims which most Christian theologians would reject. In response, he\nadds three further elements to the model, as shown here:\n\n\n\n\nHere, D = the divine nature of the Son, N = the human nature of the\nSon, and B = the body of the Son. As before, the lines with arrows on\neach end represent the symmetrical improper parthood relation. In this\nillustration the one-arrow lines represent the asymmetrical proper\nparthood relation. Thus, the divine nature of the Son and the\nhuman nature of the Son are proper parts of the composite Son, and the\nhuman body is a proper part of the human nature (and thus, also of the\ncomposite Son).\n\nMolto leaves it up to theologians whether this sort of theory is\northodox (514\u20137). His suggestion is only that this may be a\nsimpler and less controversial solution to the logical problem of the\nTrinity, that is, to showing how trinitarian claims do not imply a\ncontradiction.
