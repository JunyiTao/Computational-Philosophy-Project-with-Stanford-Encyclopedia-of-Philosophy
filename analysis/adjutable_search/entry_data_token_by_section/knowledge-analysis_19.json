    "main_text": "Knowledge First\n11. Knowledge First\n\nNot every concept is analyzable into more fundamental terms. This is\nclear both upon reflection on examples\u2014what analysis could be\noffered of hydrogen, animal, or John F.\nKennedy?\u2014and on grounds of infinite regress. Why should we\nthink that knowledge has an analysis? In recent work,\nespecially his 2000 book Knowledge and Its Limits, Timothy\nWilliamson has argued that the project of analyzing knowledge was a\nmistake. His reason is not that he thinks that knowledge is an\nuninteresting state, or that the notion of knowledge is somehow\nfundamentally confused. On the contrary, Williamson thinks that\nknowledge is among the most fundamental psychological and\nepistemological states there are. As such, it is a mistake to analyze\nknowledge in terms of other, more fundamental epistemic notions,\nbecause knowledge itself is, in at least many cases, more fundamental.\nAs Williamson puts it, we should put \u201cknowledge first\u201d.\nKnowledge might figure into some analyses, but it will do so in the\nanalysans, not in the\n analysandum.[35]\n\nThere is no very straightforward argument for this conclusion; its\ncase consists largely in the attempted demonstration of the\ntheoretical success of the knowledge first stance. Weighing these\nbenefits against those of more traditional approaches to knowledge is\nbeyond the scope of this\n article.[36]\n\nAlthough Williamson denies that knowledge is susceptible to analysis\nin the sense at issue in this article, he does think that there are\ninteresting and informative ways to characterize knowledge. For\nexample, Williamson accepts these claims:\n\nKnowledge is the most general factive mental state.\nS knows that p if and only if S\u2019s total\nevidence includes the proposition that p.\n\n\nWilliamson is also careful to emphasize that the rejection of the\nproject of analyzing knowledge in no way suggests that there are not\ninteresting and informative necessary or sufficient conditions on\nknowledge. The traditional ideas that knowledge entails truth, belief,\nand justification are all consistent with the knowledge first project.\nAnd Williamson (2000: 126) is explicit in endorsement of a safety\nrequirement on knowledge\u2014just not one that serves as part of an\nanalysis.\n\nOne point worth recognizing, then, is that one need not engage in the\nambitious project of attempting to analyze knowledge in order to have\ncontact with a number of interesting questions about which factors are\nand are not relevant for whether a subject has knowledge. In the next\nsection, we consider an important contemporary debate about whether\npragmatic factors are relevant for knowledge.\n",
