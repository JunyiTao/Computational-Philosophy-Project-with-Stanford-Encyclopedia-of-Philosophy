    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe purpose of this entry is to provide a systematic introduction to\nmedieval views about the nature and ontological status of relations.\nGiven the current state of our knowledge of medieval philosophy,\nespecially with regard to relations, it is not possible to discuss all\nthe nuances of even the best-known medieval philosophers\u2019 views.\nIn what follows, therefore, we shall restrict our aim to identifying\nand describing (a) the main types of position that were developed\nduring the Middle Ages, and (b) the most important considerations that\nshaped their development. We shall have occasion along the way,\nhowever, to examine in detail certain aspects of the views of\nimportant representatives of all the main medieval positions,\nincluding Peter Abelard (1079\u20131142), Gilbert of Poitiers\n(1085\u20131154), Albert the Great (1200\u20131280), Thomas Aquinas\n(1225\u20131274), John Duns Scotus (1265\u20131308), Henry Harclay\n(1270\u20131317), Peter Auriol (1280\u20131322), and William Ockham\n(1285\u20131347).\n",
