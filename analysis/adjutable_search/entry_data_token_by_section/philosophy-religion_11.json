    "main_text": "Philosophical Reflection on Theism and Its Alternatives || .6 Religious experience\n6. Religious Pluralism\n\nIn the midst of the new work on religious traditions, there has been a\nsteady, growing representation of non-monotheistic traditions. An\nearly proponent of this expanded format was Ninian Smart\n(1927\u20132001), who, through many publications, scholarly as well\nas popular, secured philosophies of Hinduism and Buddhism as\ncomponents in the standard canon of English-speaking philosophy of\nreligion. \n\nSmart championed the thesis that there are genuine differences between\nreligious traditions. He therefore resisted seeing some core\nexperience as capturing the essential identity of being religious.\nUnder Smart\u2019s tutelage, there has been considerable growth in\ncross-cultural philosophy of religion. Wilfred Cantwell Smith\n(1916\u20132000) also did a great deal to improve the representation\nof non-Western religions and reflection. See, for example, the\nRoutledge series Investigating Philosophy of Religion with\nRoutledge with volumes already published or forthcoming on Buddhism\n(Burton 2017), Hinduism (Ranganathan 2018), Daoism, and Confucianism.\nThe five volume Encyclopedia of Philosophy of Religion\n(mentioned earlier) to be published by Wiley Blackwell (projected for\n2021) will have ample contributions on the widest spectrum of\nphilosophical treatments of diverse religions to date.\n\nThe explanation of philosophy of religion has involved fresh\ntranslations of philosophical and religious texts from India, China,\nSoutheast Asia, and Africa. Exceptional figures from non-Western\ntraditions have an increased role in cross-cultural philosophy of\nreligion and religious dialogue. The late Bimal Krishna Matilal\n(1935\u20131991) made salient contributions to enrich Western\nexposure to Indian philosophy of religion (see Matilal 1882). Among\nthe mid-twentieth-century Asian philosophers, two who stand out for\nspecial note are T.R.V. Murti (1955) and S.N. Dasgupta\n(1922\u20131955). Both brought high philosophical standards along\nwith the essential philology to educate Western thinkers. As evidence\nof non-Western productivity in the Anglophone world, see Arvind Sharma\n1990 and 1995. There are now extensive treatments of pantheism and\nstudent-friendly guides to diverse religious conceptions of the\ncosmos. \n\nThe expanded interest in religious pluralism has led to extensive\nreflection on the compatibility and possible synthesis of religions.\nJohn Hick is the preeminent synthesizer of religious traditions. Hick\n(1973 a and b)) advanced a complex picture of the afterlife involving\ncomponents from diverse traditions. Over many publications and many\nyears, Hick has moved from a broadly based theistic view of God to\nwhat Hick calls \u201cthe Real\u201d, a noumenal sacred reality.\nHick claims that different religions provide us with a glimpse or\npartial access to the Real. In an influential article, \u201cThe New\nMap of the Universe of Faiths\u201d (1973a), Hick raised the\npossibility that many of the great world religions are revelatory of\nthe Real. \n\n\nSeen in [an] historical context these movements of faith\u2014the\nJudaic-Christian, the Buddhist, the Hindu, the Muslim\u2014are not\nessentially rivals. They began at different times and in different\nplaces, and each expanded outwards into the surrounding world of\nprimitive natural religion until most of the world was drawn up into\none or the other of the great revealed faiths. And once this global\npattern had become established it has ever since remained fairly\nstable\u2026 Then in Persia the great prophet Zoroaster appeared;\nChina produced Lao-tzu and then the Buddha lived, the Mahavira, the\nfounder of the Jain religion and, probably about the end of this\nperiod, the writing of the Bhagavad Gita; and Greece produced\nPythagoras and then, ending this golden age, Socrates and Plato. Then\nafter the gap of some three hundred years came Jesus of Nazareth and\nthe emergence of Christianity; and after another gap the prophet\nMohammed and the rise of Islam. The suggestion that we must\nconsider is that these were all movements of the divine\nrevelation. (Hick 1989: 136; emphasis added)\n\n\nHick sees these traditions, and others as well, as different meeting\npoints in which a person might be in relation to the same reality or\nthe Real: \n\n\nThe great world faiths embody different perceptions and conceptions\nof, and correspondingly different responses to, the Real from within\nthe major variant ways of being human; and that within each of them\nthe transformation of human existence from self-centeredness to\nReality-centeredness is taking place. (1989: 240) \n\n\nHick uses Kant to develop his central thesis. \n\n\nKant distinguishes between noumenon and phenomenon, or between a\nDing an sich [the thing itself] and the thing as it appears\nto human consciousness\u2026. In this strand of Kant\u2019s\nthought\u2014not the only strand, but the one which I am seeking to\npress into service in the epistemology of religion\u2014the noumenal\nworld exists independently of our perception of it and the phenomenal\nworld is that same world as it appears to our human\nconsciousness\u2026. I want to say that the noumenal Real is\nexperienced and thought by different human mentalities, forming and\nformed by different religious traditions, as the range of gods and\nabsolutes which the phenomenology of religion reports. (1989:\n241\u2013242)\n\n\nOne advantage of Hick\u2019s position is that it undermines a\nrationale for religious conflict. If successful, this approach would\noffer a way to accommodate diverse communities and undermine what has\nbeen a source of grave conflict in the past. \n\nHick\u2019s work since the early 1980s provided an impetus for not\ntaking what appears to be religious conflict as outright\ncontradictions. He advanced a philosophy of religion that paid careful\nattention to the historical and social context. By doing so, Hick\nthought that apparently conflicting descriptions of the sacred could\nbe reconciled as representing different perspectives on the same\nreality, the Real (see Hick 2004, 2006).\n\nThe response to Hick\u2019s proposal has been mixed. Some contend\nthat the very concept of \u201cthe Real\u201d is incoherent or not\nreligiously adequate. Indeed, articulating the nature of the Real is\nno easy task. Hick writes that the Real \n\n\ncannot be said to be one thing or many, person or thing, substance or\nprocess, good or bad, purposive or non-purposive. None of the concrete\ndescriptions that apply within the realm of human experience can apply\nliterally to the unexperienceable ground of that realm\u2026. We\ncannot even speak of this as a thing or an entity. (1989: 246). \n\n\nIt has been argued that Hick has secured not the equal acceptability\nof diverse religions but rather their unacceptability. In their\nclassical forms, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity diverge. If, say,\nthe Incarnation of God in Christ did not occur, isn\u2019t\nChristianity false? In reply, Hick has sought to interpret specific\nclaims about the Incarnation in ways that do not commit Christians to\nthe \u201cliteral truth\u201d of God becoming enfleshed. The\n\u201ctruth\u201d of the Incarnation has been interpreted in such\nterms as these: in Jesus Christ (or in the narratives about Christ)\nGod is disclosed. Or: Jesus Christ was so united with God\u2019s will\nthat his actions were and are the functional display of God\u2019s\ncharacter. Perhaps as a result of Hick\u2019s challenge,\nphilosophical work on the incarnation and other beliefs and practice\nspecific to religious traditions have received renewed attention (see,\nfor example, Taliaferro and Meister 2009). Hick has been a leading,\nwidely appreciated force in the expansion of philosophy of religion in\nthe late twentieth century. \n\nIn addition to the expansion of philosophy of religion to take into\naccount a wider set of religions, the field has also seen an expansion\nin terms of methodology. Philosophers of religion have re-discovered\nmedieval philosophy\u2014the new translations and commentaries of\nmedieval Christian, Jewish, and Islamic texts have blossomed. There is\nnow a self-conscious, deliberate effort to combine work on the\nconcepts in religious belief alongside a critical understanding of\ntheir social and political roots (the work of Foucault has been\ninfluential on this point), feminist philosophy of religion has been\nespecially important in re-thinking what may be called the ethics of\nmethodology and, as this is in some respects the most current debate\nin the field, it is a fitting point to end this entry by highlighting\nthe work of Pamela Sue Anderson (1955\u20132017) and others.\n\nAnderson (1997 and 2012) seeks to question respects in which gender\nenters into traditional conceptions of God and in their moral and\npolitical repercussions. She also advances a concept of method which\ndelimits justice and human flourishing. A mark of legitimation of\nphilosophy should be the extent to which it contributes to human\nwelfare. In a sense, this is a venerable thesis in some ancient,\nspecifically Platonic philosophy that envisaged the goal and method of\nphilosophy in terms of virtue and the good. Feminist philosophy today\nis not exclusively a critical undertaking, critiquing\n\u201cpatriarchy\u201d. For a constructive, subtle treatment of\nreligious contemplation and practice, see Coakley 2002. Another key\nmovement that is developing has come to be called Continental\nPhilosophy of Religion. A major advocate of this new turn is John\nCaputo. This movement approaches the themes of this entry (the concept\nof God, pluralism, religious experience, metaphysics and epistemology)\nin light of Heidegger, Derrida, and other continental philosophers.\n(For a good representation of this movement, see Caputo 2001 and\nCrocket, Putt, & Robins 2014.)\n",
