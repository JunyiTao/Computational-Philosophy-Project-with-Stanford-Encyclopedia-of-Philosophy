    "main_text": "Political Philosophy\n3. Political Philosophy\n\nRousseau\u2019s contributions to political philosophy are scattered\namong various works, most notable of which are the Discourse on\nInequality, the Discourse on Political Economy, The\nSocial Contract, and Considerations on the Government of\nPoland. However, many of his other works, both major and minor,\ncontain passages that amplify or illuminate the political ideas in\nthose works. His central doctrine in politics is that a state can be\nlegitimate only if it is guided by the \u201cgeneral will\u201d of\nits members. This idea finds its most detailed treatment in The\nSocial Contract.\n\nIn The Social Contract, Rousseau sets out to answer what he\ntakes to be the fundamental question of politics, the reconciliation\nof the freedom of the individual with the authority of the state. This\nreconciliation is necessary because human society has evolved to a\npoint where individuals can no longer supply their needs through their\nown unaided efforts, but rather must depend on the co-operation of\nothers. The process whereby human needs expand and interdependence\ndeepens is set out in the Discourse on Inequality. In that\nwork, the a decisive moment of Rousseau\u2019s conjectural history\ninvolves the emergence of endemic conflict among the\nnow-interdependent individuals and the argument that the Hobbesian\ninsecurity of this condition would lead all to consent to the\nestablishment of state authority and law. This establishment amounts\nto the reinforcement of unequal and exploitative social relations that\nare now backed by law and state power. In an echo of Locke and an\nanticipation of Marx, Rousseau argues that this state would, in\neffect, be a class state, guided by the common interest of the rich\nand propertied and imposing unfreedom and subordination on the poor\nand weak. The propertyless consent to such an establishment because\ntheir immediate fear of a Hobbesian state of war leads them to fail to\nattend to the ways in which the new state will systematically\ndisadvantage them.\n\nThe Social Contract aims to set out an alternative to this\ndystopia, one in which, claims Rousseau, each person will enjoy the\nprotection of the common force whilst remaining as free as they were\nin the state of nature. The key to this reconciliation is the idea of\nthe general will: that is, the collective will of the citizen body\ntaken as a whole. The general will is the source of law and is willed\nby each and every citizen. In obeying the law each citizen is thus\nsubject to his or her own will, and consequently, according to\nRousseau, remains free.\n",
