    "main_text": "\n\nWhat is erotic art? Do all paintings with a sexual theme qualify as\nerotic? How to distinguish between erotica and erotic art? In what way\nare aesthetic experiences related to, or different from, erotic\nexperiences and are they at all compatible? Both people and works of\nart can be sensually appealing, but is the beauty in each case\nsubstantially the same? How helpful is the distinction between the\nnude and the naked? Can we draw a strict line between erotic art and\npornography? We tend to think of art as complex and of pornography as\none-dimensional, but how compelling is that differentiation?\nPornography is often considered harmful, objectifying, and\nexploitative, but to what extent is erotic art immune to moral\ncriticism of this sort? In addressing such questions this entry will\nprovide an overview of current philosophical debates on erotic art. It\nwill also place those debates in historical perspective and, in the\nclosing section, explore some important avenues for future\nresearch.\n",
