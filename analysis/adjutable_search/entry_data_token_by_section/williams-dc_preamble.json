    "main_text": "\n\nThe published work of Donald Williams (1899\u20131983) ranges across\na broad spectrum in philosophy, but his importance as a philosopher\nrests in large measure on four major achievements. Firstly, in a\nperiod when the role of philosophy was being diminished and\ntrivialized, he persisted with a traditional style of philosophizing.\nAlthough it remained unfashionable throughout most of his active\nyears, he held to the classic program of Western philosophy: to\nexplain and defend our capacity to attain knowledge (so far as that\nreaches), in the light of that to present a well-reasoned account of\nthe most general and fundamental features of Reality, and on that\nbasis to propose a wise scheme for the good life. His unswerving\nallegiance to this project, keeping it alive in dark days, has had its\nreward. At least in Anglophone circles, these classic metaphysical,\nepistemic and ethical issues are once more firmly on the agenda.\n\nWilliams\u2019 own contributions belong to the epistemic and\nmetaphysical aspects of the project rather than its ethical side\n(except for a brief defense of ethics as ultimately \u201cpure\npostulate\u201d (1933b)). So, secondly, as an account of our world he\nproposed an empirically informed materialistic naturalism. Among its\ndistinctive features, he champions a 4-dimensional space-time which\naccords equal status to Past, Present, and Future.\n\nThirdly, this cosmology is embedded in an original and powerful theory\nof the nature of properties, the thesis that properties are themselves\nparticulars rather than universals. This Trope theory, as it has come\nto be known, following Williams\u2019 own usage, has become one of\nthe standard alternatives in the Problem of Universals.\n\nAnd in the fourth place, in the teeth of the prevailing skepticism on\nthis topic, he developed an original and boldly positive justification\nof inductive inference.\n",
