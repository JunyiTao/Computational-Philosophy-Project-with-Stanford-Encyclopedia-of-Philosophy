The most recent discussion on skilled\naction concerns the extent to which they are automatic or under\nconscious control. A long tradition has taken skilled action to be\nparadigmatically a matter of \u201cabsorbed coping\u201d (Heidegger\n1927; Merleau-Ponty 1945 [1962]; Dreyfus 1991)\u2014characterized as\nimmersion in the situation and intuitive response to its demands, with\nlittle awareness of the body, tools or even possibly the activity\nitself. Following Dreyfus and the phenomenological tradition, some\nenactivists (e.g., No\u00eb 2004) highlight the analogies between\nskillful behavior and perception; other enactivists (e.g., Gallagher\n2017; Hutto & Robertson 2020) argue that in order to understand\nthe automaticity and unreflectiveness of skilled action, we ought to\nbetter understand habitual behavior. Even outside the phenomenological\ntradition, people have emphasized the unreflective aspect of skilled\naction. For example, Papineau (2013) argues that skilled actions are\ntypically too fast for conscious control. One important argument for\nthe unreflectiveness of skilled action starts from the phenomenon of\nchoking under pressure, where an individual performs significantly\nworse than would be expected in a high-pressure situation. This\nphenomenon has been taken to be evidence that skillful action proceeds\nwithout conscious attention, because choking episodes are thought to\narise from the fact that anxiety leads one to focus and direct\none\u2019s mind on the performance, which would proceed smoothly if\nmindless (Baumeister 1984; Masters 1992; Beilock & Carr 2001;\nFord, Hodges, & Williams 2005; Jackson, Ashford, & Norsworthy\n2006; Gucciardi & Dimmock 2008). Some argue that unreflectiveness\nalso characterizes skillful joint action (H\u00f8ffding 2014;\nGallagher and Ilund\u00e1in-Agurruza 2020).\n\nIn recent years, however, some have emphasized the role of attention\nand consciousness in skillful performance (Montero 2016, 2020; Wu\n2016, 2020). Montero argues against the Dreyfusian idea of skillful\nand mindless coping, by noting that online conscious thought about\nwhat one is doing is compatible with expertise and by surveying\nempirical evidence that suggests revisiting the choking argument.\nChristensen, Sutton and McIlwain (2016) and Christensen, Sutton, and\nBicknell\u2019s (2019) argue for the centrality of cognition in\nexplaining the flexibility of skilled action in complex situations and\nadvance a \u201cmesh theory\u201d of skilled action, according to\nwhich skilled action results for a mesh of both automatic and\ncognitively controlled processes (for a survey of some of these\nissues, Christensen 2019. See also Sutton 2007 and Fridland\n2017b).\n",
