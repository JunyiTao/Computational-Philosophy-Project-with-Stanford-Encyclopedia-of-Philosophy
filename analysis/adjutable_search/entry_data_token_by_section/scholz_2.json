    "main_text": "Life || Institute for Mathematical Logic and Foundational Research\n2.2 Institute for Mathematical Logic and Foundational Research\n\nThe \u201cMemorandum about the New Mathematical Logic and\nFoundational Research\u201d written for the Reichs- und\nPreu\u00dfischen Minister f\u00fcr Wissenschaft, Erziehung und\nVolksbildung (Imperial and Prussian Secretary for Science, Education\nand National Instruction) on January 15, 1938 (Scholz 1938) shows that\nfor Scholz this new subject went beyond symbolic or mathematical\nlogic, but further included applications of logical analysis to\nfoundational problems in general. According to Scholz, the new subject\nwas prepared by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716), created\nby Gottlob Frege (1848\u20131925), and taken up by David Hilbert\n(1862\u20131943) who, adopting Bertrand Russell\u2019s\n(1872\u20131970) elaboration of Frege\u2019s creation, made it the\nsubject of deep investigations aiming, e.g., \u201cat a consistency\nproof for classical logic\u201d, and with this, of classical\nmathematics (presupposing the logicist reduction of mathematics to\nlogic). This new approach was, according to Scholz, directed against\nKant\u2019s opinion that \u201cfoundational questions of any kind in\nprinciple cannot be treated with mathematical methods and with\nmathematical means of construction and research questions\u201d. Its\ntask was a deepening and clarifying of foundations by combining\nstructural investigations and the analysis of the context of\napplication.\n\nIn M\u00fcnster, Scholz taught right from the beginning to a large\nextent on logic, in particular \u201clogistic\u201d, as the new,\ni.e., formal, symbolic, algebraic, algorithmic or mathematical logic\nwas called since the Second International Congress for Philosophy at\nGeneva in 1904 (cf. Couturat 1904; Scholz 1931a, 57). In April 1936 he\nreceived an official extension of his philosophical appointment to\n\u201cLogistic Logic and Foundational Research\u201d. In the same\nyear, \u201cSection B\u201d (consisting of Scholz\u2019s chair and\nthe academic and non-academic staff attached to it) of the\nPhilosophical Seminar was renamed \u201cLogistic Section\u201d. The\nnext step was taken in 1938 when this \u201csection\u201d became a\n\u201cseminar\u201d of its own. The denomination of Scholz\u2019s\nchair was changed to \u201cPhilosophy of Mathematics and Science with\nSpecial Consideration of the New Logic and Foundational\nResearch\u201d. In 1943 the denomination was changed again to\n\u201cMathematical Logic and Foundational Research\u201d. The\n\u201cLogistic Seminar\u201d was renamed \u201cSeminar for\nMathematical Logic and Foundational Research\u201d in 1946, and\nfinally, in 1950, it was renamed again, and elevated in its\norganizational status, to \u201cInstitute for Mathematical Logic and\nFoundational Research\u201d (cf. Schmidt am Busch & Wehmeier\n2005a).\n\nScholz was also politically effective in promoting his field. He\nassembled the \u201cGruppe von M\u00fcnster\u201d (later\n\u201cSchule von M\u00fcnster\u201d) and encouraged a number of his\nstudents to undertake studies in logic and foundational research,\nplacing some of them in academic positions. They obtained important\nresults in the theory of the predicate calculus, the theory of\naxiomatic systems, metamathematics, semantics and abstraction theory.\nAmong them were Friedrich Bachmann (1909\u20131982), Albrecht\nBecker-Freyseng (1907\u20131976), Gisbert Hasenjaeger\n(1919\u20132006), Hans Hermes (1912\u20132003), Walter Kinder\n(1909\u20131998), Karl Schr\u00f6ter (1905\u20131977), and Hermann\nSchweitzer (1909\u20132002). For the publication of this\nschool\u2019s results and related investigations Scholz founded the\nseries Forschungen zur Logik und zur Grundlegung der exakten\nWissenschaften (eight issues 1937\u20131943, n.s. reprinted as\nScholz, ed. 1970). Among them is the outstanding book by Heinrich\nScholz and Hermann Schweitzer Die sogenannten Definitionen durch\nAbstraktion with its elaboration of modern abstraction theory\nusing equivalence classes (Scholz and Schweitzer 1935).\n\nIn trying to establish a world-leading center of mathematical logic\nand foundational research at M\u00fcnster, he was able to obtain\nFrege\u2019s Nachlass for his chair in M\u00fcnster in 1935.\nLater, he added to this collection the papers of the German algebraist\nof logic, Ernst Schr\u00f6der (1841\u20131902), which he had obtained\nfrom the library of the Technical University of Karlsruhe. It is one\nof the tragic effects of World War II that Frege\u2019s and\nSchr\u00f6der\u2019s papers were lost, perhaps destroyed during the\nbomb attacks on M\u00fcnster in March 1945 (cf. Peckhaus 1993;\nWehmeier and Schmidt am Busch 2000). Scholz had intended to publish a\nthree-volume edition of Frege\u2019s posthumous work and\ncorrespondence. Most of the typewritten copies Scholz had made of the\noriginal material were saved (on the Frege papers cf. Scholz and\nBachmann 1936).\n\nIn the beginning of the 1930s M\u00fcnster still stood in the shadow\nof G\u00f6ttingen as a center of research on logic. After the National\nSocialists\u2019 seizure of power, most of German language logicians\nlost their positions and were forced into emigration. Only\nM\u00fcnster survived as a place for research on logic and\nfoundations. Scholz was successful in resisting the attacks from the\nside of the so-called \u201cDeutsche Mathematik\u201d, a\nNational-Socialist racist movement emphasizing the mathematical work\nof German \u201cnational comrades\u201d (Volksgenossen).\nThe Munich mathematician Max Steck (1907\u20131971) was particularly\nhostile. Steck\u2019s book, Das Hauptproblem der Mathematik\n(1942), is directed against logicism, the axiomatic method,\nand metamathematics, as proposed by logicians and mathematicians close\nto David Hilbert and his school. Steck labeled Hilbert\u2019s\nformalism as a \u201csimply catastrophic\u201d mental one-sidedness,\na \u201cdecadence\u201d from the perspective of intellectual history\n(Steck 1942, p. 205). In several places Scholz is attacked as\nHilbert\u2019s spokesman. Steck calls Scholz\u2019s M\u00fcnster\nSchool a \u201ctransplantation of the earlier so-called Vienna Circle\nto M\u00fcnster in Westphalia\u201d (p. 176).\n\nDuring the Third Reich Scholz served as a kind of information broker,\nmediating contacts between \u00e9migr\u00e9s and those who stayed\nbehind. He was able to support his Polish friends, helping, e.g., to\nrescue Jan Salamucha (1903\u20131944) from the concentration camp in\nSachsenhausen in 1940 (an action for which German authorities\nthreatened him with removal from his professorial chair). He supported\nAlfred Tarski (1901\u20131983), who had emigrated to the U.S.A., by\nmaintaining contact with his wife and his two children, who still\nlived in Warsaw. He supported Jan \u0141ukasiewicz (1878\u20131956)\nand his wife financially and was eventually able to help them to leave\nPoland and to hide in Germany. They feared for their lives in case the\nRed Army would conquer Poland (cf. Bolewski and Pierzcha\u0142a 1989,\nSchreiber 1999, Peckhaus 1998\u20131999, Schmidt am Busch and\nWehmeier 2005b).\n",
