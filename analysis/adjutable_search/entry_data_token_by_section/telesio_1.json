    "main_text": "Cosmology\n2. Cosmology\n\nTelesio\u2019s vision of the genesis of nature is simple to the point of\nbeing archaic, yet at the same time astonishingly modern in the sense\nthat he seems to have been one of the very first defenders of a theory\nof natural evolution without metaphysical or theological\npresuppositions. According to his De rerum natura, the only\nthings which must be presupposed are passive matter and active force,\nthe latter of which Telesio thought of as twofold, heat and cold.\nThese principles were meant to replace the Aristotelian metaphysical\nprinciples of matter and form. In order to explain how all natural\nbeings came into existence by  these opposing forces, Telesio\npresumed that in the beginning God had created two primary globes, the\nsun and the earth, the sun being the seat of heat, the earth that of\ncoldness, and that He had separated them with such a distance in space\nthat they could not extinguish each other (DRN book I, ch. IV). All\nnatural things result from the battle of these antagonistic forces for\nthe possession of matter. The main region of that creative battle is\nthe surface of the earth, where they create metals, stones and animate\nbeings. The primary activity of warmth is to move fast and to dilate\nand rarefy matter, whereas that of cold is to hinder movement and to\ncondense matter. Things differ according to the amount of heat or cold\nthey possess (and therefore according to their density and derivative\nqualities such as velocity and colour). The quantity of matter is not\nchanged through the action of these forces upon it. The role of heat,\ncold and matter as \u2018natural principles\u2019 had been\nhighlighted before by Girolamo Fracastoro in the first version of the\nHomocentrica and in the dialogue Fracastorius sive De\nanima (Lerner 1992), as well as by Girolamo Cardano in his\nLiber unicus de natura.\n\nTelesio\u2019s cosmology puts an end to metaphysical explanations. Telesio\nthought space to be absolute (DRN book I, ch. XXV\u2013XXVIII), thus\nabolishing the Aristotelian notion of a bipartite cosmos divided into\na sublunary world, in which generation and corruption take place, and\na supralunary sphere with eternal regular movements. The existence of\nvacuum within space is admitted, but things are said to have a natural\ninclination to avoid empty space. In the cosmological chapters of book\nIV Telesio critizised the Aristotelian explanation of the movement of\nthe cosmos by a transcendent telos, the God of Aristotle\u2019s\nmetaphysics: the sky doesn\u2019t move because of a desire for a being more\nperfect than itself, but because it is its own nature to move and thus\nto sustain its own life (DRN book IV, ch. XXIV; Aristotle,\nMetaph. XII, ch. 6\u20137). Likewise, he rejected the idea\nthat the motions of the subordinate spheres were caused by unmoved\nmovers, the pure intelligences of the Aristotelian and Christian\ntraditions, an assumption which he reprimanded to be obscure and\nincomprehensible even via imagination (Bond\u00ec 1018).\n\nThe things of nature are not created, governed and sustained by divine\nprovidence. In Telesio\u2019s philosophy, there is no such thing as a\ntranscendent mind or idea. All things act solely according to their\nown nature, starting from the primary forces of cold and heat. The\nEpicurean chance is enclosed in Telesio\u2019s Stoic-influenced philosophy\nof nature (Kessler 1992): everything can produce everything, an idea\nwhich was soon to be sharply rejected by Francesco Patrizi da Chierso,\none of the most important contemporary readers of Telesio\n(\u201cObiectiones\u201d, in the appendix of Telesio\u2019s Varii\nlibelli, p. 467 f.). In order to sustain themselves, these\nprimary forces and all beings which arise through their antagonistic\ninteraction must be able to sense themselves as well as the opposite\nforce, that is, they must sense what is convenient and what is\ninconvenient or damaging for their survival and well-being. Sensation,\ntherefore, is not the property of embodied souls. Telesio\u2019s philosophy\ncan thus be described as a pansensism in the sense that all beings,\nanimate or inanimate, are said to have the power of sensation.\n",
