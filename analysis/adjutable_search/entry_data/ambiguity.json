    "preamble": "\n\nFun fact: the word \u2018ambiguous\u2019, at least according to the\nOxford English Dictionary, is ambiguous: it can mean uncertainty or\ndubiousness on the one hand and a sign bearing multiple meanings on\nthe other. I mention this merely to disambiguate what this entry is\nabout, which concerns a word or phrase enjoying multiple meanings. In\nthis sense, ambiguity has been the source of much frustration,\nbemusement, and amusement for philosophers, lexicographers, linguists,\ncognitive scientists, literary theorists and critics, authors, poets,\norators and pretty much every other being who uses language regularly\nto communicate.\n\nPhilosophers\u2019 interest in ambiguity stems from several sources,\nranging from an intense interest in logical representation to\npragmatic, political and ethical concerns about how we use language to\ncommunicate. An example of the first concerns regarding the\nregimentation of natural language in formal logic: arguments that may\nlook good in virtue of their linguistic form in fact can go very wrong\nif the words or phrases involved are equivocal. It would be logical\nfolly, for example, to conclude from the true (on one reading)\nsentences \u2018All bachelors are necessarily unmarried\u2019 and\n\u2018Adam was a bachelor\u2019 that Adam was necessarily unmarried.\nIn other words, philosophers have often found ambiguity the sort of\nthing one needs to avoid and eradicate when they do their serious\nphilosophical business. Frege worried about the phenomenon enough to\ncounsel against allowing any multiplicities of sense in a perfect\nlanguage. An example of the second may be found in the infamous case\nof Smith vs. United States in which the law stipulated that a\nweapon used in the main question was whether the law proscribing\npenalties for using a firearm in committing a crime applied\nto weapons used as items of exchange for drugs.\n\nAuthors, poets, lyricists and the like, on the other hand, have often\nfound ambiguity to be an extremely powerful tool. Thomas\nPynchon\u2019s sentence \u201cwe have forests full of game and\nhundreds of beaters who drive the animals toward the hunters such as\nmyself who are waiting to shoot them,\u201d (Against the Day, p. 46)\nutilizes the referential ambiguity of \u2018them\u2019 to great\neffect when said by his fictionalized Archduke Ferdinand.\nShakespeare\u2019s \u201cAsk for me tomorrow and you shall find me a\ngrave man\u201d (Romeo and Juliet, Act III, Scene 1 line 97\u201398)\nplays cleverly on the double meaning of \u2018grave\u2019. Comedians\nhave often found ambiguity useful in the misdirection essential to\nsome forms of comedy. Groucho Marx\u2019s \u201cI shot an elephant\nin my pajamas\u201d is a classic example.\n\nAmbiguity is important and it is worth examining what the phenomenon\nis and how it differs and relates to similar phenomena such as\nindexicality, polysemy, vagueness, and especially sense generality.\nWhile \u2018is an uncle\u2019 can be satisfied by both brothers of\nmothers and brothers of fathers, the phrase is not ambiguous but\nunspecified with respect to parent.  The boundaries of the predicate\n\u2018is a heap\u2019 is famously difficult to detect but the\nproblem doesn\u2019t seem to be that \u2018heap\u2019 enjoys too\nmany meanings. The article will focus on what the phenomenon is and\nisn\u2019t and discuss some of the interesting factors that\nconfound the easy detection and categorization of apparent\nambiguities.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nAmbiguity is generally taken to be a property enjoyed by signs that\nbear multiple (legitimate) interpretations in a language or, more\ngenerally, some system of signs.  \u2019legitimate\u2019 is a cover\nterm I\u2019m using to nod to the fact that many signs can, in principle,\nbear just about any interpretation.  The relativization is to\nprevent ambiguity in terms like like \u2018leaped\u2019\nwhich means leaped in English but loved in German.  In\ncommon parlance, the word \u2018ambiguity\u2019 is used loosely:\noften simple underspecificity will suffice for a charge of ambiguity.\nThe U.S.\u2019s policy towards the unification of China and Taiwan\nhas been described as a policy of \u2018strategic ambiguity\u2019,\none that allows the U.S. to be non-specific with respect to the status\nof Taiwan. \u2018Jane\u2019s sister will come to visit\u2019 is\nsometimes thought to be ambiguous when Jane has multiple sisters. A\nmovie with a character that heads to surgery at the end, leaving it\nopen whether he lives or dies, is said to have an ambiguous ending.\nThere is a medical condition known as \u2018ambiguous\ngenitalia\u2019 in which the genitals don\u2019t categorize clearly, or\nexclusively, into male or female genitalia.\n\nIn many domains, however, theorists have found it useful to divide the\nphenomenon of ambiguity from other phenomena (e.g.,\nunderspecification, vagueness, context sensitivity). Ambiguity is of\ninterest to philosophers for a variety of reasons, some of which we\nwill look at below. First, ambiguity makes vivid some of the\ndifferences between formal languages and natural languages and\npresents demands on the usage of the former to provide\nrepresentations of the latter. Second, ambiguity can have a\ndeleterious effect on our ability to determine the validity of\narguments in natural language on account of possible equivocation.\nThird, ambiguity in art can intentionally (or unintentionally)\nincrease the interest in a work of art by refusing to allow easy\ncategorization and interpretation. Fourth, ambiguity in the statement\nof the law can undermine their applicability and our ability to\nobey them. Finally, ambiguity resolution is an important feature of our\ncognitive understanding and interpretative abilities. Studying\nambiguity and how we resolve it in practice can give us insight into both thought\nand interpretation.\n\nAmbiguity has excited philosophers for a very, very long time. It was\nstudied in the context of the study of fallacies in Aristotle\u2019s\nSophistical Refutations. Aristotle identifies various\nfallacies associated with ambiguity and\n amphiboly[1]\n writing:\n\n\nThere are three varieties of these ambiguities and amphibolies: (1)\nWhen either the expression or the name has strictly more than one\nmeaning\u2026 (2) when by custom we use them so; (3) when words that\nhave a simple sense taken alone have more than one meaning in\ncombination; e.g. \u2018knowing letters\u2019. For each word, both\n\u2018knowing\u2019 and \u2018letters\u2019, possibly has a single\nmeaning: but both together have more than one-either that the letters\nthemselves have knowledge or that someone else has it of them.\n(Sophistical Refutations bk. 4)\n\n\nThe stoics were also intrigued by ambiguity (see Atherton 1993).\nChrysippus claimed at one point that every word is\nambiguous \u2013 though by this he meant that the same person may\nunderstand a word spoken to him in many distinct ways. Philosophers\nconcerned with the relation between language and thought, particularly\nthose who argue for a language of thought, concerned\nthemselves with whether the language in which we think could contain\nambiguous phrases. Ockham, for example, was willing to countenance\nambiguities in mental sentences of a language of thought but not\nmental terms in that language (see Spade p. 101). Frege contemplated\nnon-overlap of sense in natural language in a famous footnote,\nwriting:\n\n\n\u2026So long as the reference remains the same, such variations of\nsense may be tolerated, although they are to be avoided in the\ntheoretical structure of a demonstrative science and ought not to\noccur in a perfect language. (Frege 1948 [1892], p. 210 fn. 2)\n\n\nFrege\u2019s hostility to ambiguity remains with\nus today. Frequently we use formal languages precisely so that we can\ndisambiguate otherwise ambiguous sentences (brackets being a paradigm\nexample of a disambiguating device).\n\nGiving an account of ambiguity (and disambiguation) requires one to\ndiscern the bearer(s) of ambiguity. Propositions, for example, are\npresumably unambiguous (since they are meanings they can\u2019t be\nsubject to further considerations of meaning). This leaves a range of\npotential objects: utterances, utterances relative to a context,\nsentences, sentences relative to a context, discourses,\ninscriptions\u2026. The differences aren\u2019t trivial: a written\ndown sentence corresponds to many possible ways of being uttered in\nwhich features such as prosody can prevent certain meanings that the\nwritten down sentence seems capable of enjoying. Two written\nutterances may sound the same (if they contain words that sound alike)\nwithout being spelt alike (if the words aren\u2019t co-spelled) thus\nresulting in phonological ambiguity without corresponding orthographic\nambiguity.  I\u2019m going to (somewhat perversely) simply use\n\u2018sentence\u2019 and \u2018phrase\u2019 ambiguously, and I\nwill attempt to disambiguate when necessary. We will also look briefly\nat the application of ambiguity to discourse transitions. \n\nOne important question regarding ambiguity is how we ought to\nrepresent ambiguities. With structural ambiguities there is no\nindependent issue but with lexical ambiguities there is a real issue.\nIt\u2019s tempting to see this as a question we could answer in any\nnumber of equally good ways. For example, we may choose to represent\nthe meaning of \u2018bank\u2019 disjunctively or we may choose to\nindividuate \u2018bank\u2019 as multiple lexical items that simply\nsound and look alike, perhaps using subscripts. Both are potentially\nproblematic if taken as analyses: disjunctive meanings are not unique\nto ambiguity (I can introduce any term I like with a single\ndisjunctive meaning), and representation using subscripts simply masks\nthe question of what the subscripts represent. This suggests that the\nissue is more like a problem than a nuisance or a trivial choice and\nactually has serious ramifications for how to pursue truth conditional\nsemantics. (See Davidson 1967, Gillon 1990, and Saka 2007 (Ch. 6) for\nan interesting account of the problem regarding representing\nambiguity.) I\u2019ll proceed as though lexical ambiguities are properly\nrepresented as two separate words/lexical items that overlap with\nrespect to some significant feature (phonologically, graphemically,\npictorially\u2026).\n\nA brief terminological point: \u2018polysemy\u2019 refers to a\nphenomenon that is closely related to ambiguity, but often is\ncharacterized as a term with multiple meanings that are, in some hard\nto specify sense, interestingly related. For example, \u2018in\u2019\nis often thought to be a paradigm of polysemy: to be in a car, in my\nthoughts and in trouble seem to play on notions of containment but\nthere is clearly a difference in how we interpret \u2018in\u2019 in\neach case. It is sometimes characterized as a phenomenon subsumable\nunder ambiguity (basically, an ambiguity with the meanings that are\ntightly related meanings) but sometimes it is taken to be a different\nphenomenon altogether. One traditional carving is that ambiguity in\nwords is a matter of two or more lexical entries that correspond to\nthe same word and polysemy a single lexeme that has multiple\nmeanings.[2] For\nthe rest of this article, I will assume that polysemy is simply\nambiguity with tightly corresponding meanings and I will not try to\ndistinguish polysemy from ambiguity very carefully.  Many cognitive\nlinguists contend that there there is no principled way to divide\nthese in any case. It\u2019s worth noticing that terms could be both\nambiguous and polysemous if it had three meanings, two of which were\nsuitably related and one which was quite far apart from the other\ntwo. See Vicente and Falkum (2017) for a detailed look at\npolysemy.  \n2. What (Linguistic) Ambiguity Isn\u2019t\n\n\u2018Ambiguity\u2019, as used by philosophers of language and\nlinguists, refers to a more specific phenomenon than that of multiple permissible interpretations. Distinguishing\nambiguity from these related phenomenon can be a difficult and\ntendentious (and sometimes tedious!) affair. We will discuss testing for ambiguity below: for\nnow, we will try to isolate ambiguity by separating it from other\ntypical cases with which ambiguity is easily conflated.\n2.1 Vagueness\n\nCharacterizing vagueness is notoriously (and ironically) difficult,\nbut it seems to stem from lack of precision in the meaning or\nreference of a term or phrase. There are clearly words that are\nambiguous but not (obviously) vague: \u2018bat\u2019 is not vague\nbut it is ambiguous. \u2018Is bald\u2019 looks to be vague but not\nambiguous. \n\nA general hallmark of vagueness is that it involves borderline cases:\npossible cases that are neither clearly in the extension of the vague\nterm nor clearly not in its extension. An alternative characterization\ninvolves fuzzy boundaries rather than borderline cases (see Fara 2000,\n47\u201348). Cases of ambiguity can be like this: one can imagine a sorites\nseries involving something that is clearly a baseball bat at\nt1 that is changed particle by particle into a\nchiropteran with borderline cases of each mid-series, thus being a\nvague case of \u2018bat\u2019 in both senses. However, ambiguity\nneed not be characterized by borderline cases nor by sorites-series\nsusceptibility.\n\nInterestingly, there are views regarding vague language that treat\nvagueness as at least akin to ambiguity. Braun and Sider (2007) treat\nsentences with vague terms as expressing multiple distinct\npropositions and supervaluationism treats vague terms as expressing\nmultiple distinct semantic values. But the relevant notion of multiple\nexpression seem different from paradigmatic ambiguity, where two\nmeanings are definitely meanings of a term or phrase, not where a\nbunch of meanings are acceptable ways of making a term more\nprecise. If anything, one might think that these views treat vagueness\nas a sort of polysemy.\n2.2 Context Sensitivity\n\nContext sensitivity is (potential) variability in content due purely\nto changes in the context of utterance without a change in the\nconvention of word usage. Thus, \u2018I am hungry\u2019 varies in\ncontent speaker to speaker because \u2018I\u2019 is context\nsensitive and shifts reference depending on who utters it.\n\u2018I\u2019, however, is not massively ambiguous \u2013 if\nanything, the mystery of context sensitive terms has been how they\ncould have a single meaning with multiple reference.\n\u2018Bank\u2019 is ambiguous, not (at least, not obviously) context\nsensitive. Of course, knowledge of context may well help disambiguate\nan ambiguous utterance. Nonetheless, ambiguity is not characterized by\ninteraction with (extra- linguistic) context but is a property of the\nmeanings of the terms.\n2.3 Under-specification and Generality\n\nI have a sister in New York, a sister in Kingston and one in Toronto.\nIf I tell you that I am going to visit one of my sisters, what I say\nunderspecifies which sister I am going to see. This can be frustrating\nif you are trying to figure out where I am going. But this\nisn\u2019t due to \u2018one of my sisters\u2019 being ambiguous\nambiguous. Its meaning is clear. The sentence is\n\u2018sense-general\u2019; it doesn\u2019t specify some detail without\nthereby being ambiguous with respect to that detail. In general,\nunder- determination and generality may leave open many possibilities\nwithout being ambiguous between those possibilities. One more\nterminological note: in the cognitive linguistics literature (e.g.\nDunbar 2001) it is common to treat what we call \u2018sense\ngenerality\u2019 as vagueness: a single lexeme with a unified meaning\nthat is unspecified with respect to certain features.\n\nSimilarly, if I tell you that I am going to visit my aunt, I\nunderspecify whether it is my mother\u2019s sister or my\nfather\u2019s sister whom I am going to go visit. Nothing follows\nabout the univocality or ambiguity of \u2018aunt\u2019. It simply\nmeans \u2018aunt\u2019 is true of things that are female siblings of\nyour parent. By the same token, \u2018human\u2019 doesn\u2019t make\nany demand on an person\u2019s mass in order to be part of its\nextension.\n\nIt is easy to mistake sense generality for ambiguity, as often the\nextension of a univocal term can break up into two or more distinct\nsalient categories. The sentence \u2018I ordered filet mignon\u2019\ndoesn\u2019t specify whether or not the filet was to be given to me\ncooked or raw.\nYou will surely be annoyed and say \u2018that\u2019s not what I\nmeant\u2019 at a restaurant if the waiter brings the filet raw, but\nnot so at the butcher shop. Often it is difficult to tell when the\ndistinction in extension corresponds to an ambiguity in the meaning of\nthe term. But difficulty in telling these apart in some cases should\nnot lead us to abjure the distinction.\n2.4 Sense and Reference Transfer\n\nOne difficult phenomenon to classify is transference of sense or\nreference (see Nunberg, Ward). When you say \u2018I am parked on G\nSt.\u2019, you presumably manage to refer to the car rather than\nyourself. Similarly, \u2018I am traditionally allowed a final\nsupper\u2019 said by a prisoner is not about himself (there are no\ntraditions regarding him). The mechanics of reference transfer are\nmysterious, and the interaction of transferred terms with the syntax\nis a matter of some dispute.\n\nOf course, sentences can have many of these properties at once.\n\u2018My uncle wonders if I am parked where the bank begins\u2019 is\nsense-general, ambiguous, context-sensitive, vague and it involves\nreference-transfer. Nonetheless, it is important to keep these\nproperties apart as the semantic treatment we give each may vary\nwildly, the ways of testing for them may require highly specialized\nconsiderations and their source may well differ radically from\nphenomenon to phenomenon.\n3. Types of Ambiguity\n\nThere are different sources and types of ambiguities. To explore\nthese, however, we will need to adopt some terminology to make clear\nwhat sorts of phenomena we are looking at. Those familiar with some of\nthe issues in current syntactic theory can skip until the next\nsection.\n\nModern linguistic theory involves, in part, the study of syntax. The\ndominant strain of current syntactic theory takes the lexicon as\nprimitive and studies the rule-governed derivation of syntactic forms,\nwhich are structures known as LFs (or, more misleadingly, Logical\nForms). The relationship of sentences in natural language to LFs can\nbe one to many: the phonological/orthographic forms of a sentence can\nbe associated with more than one LF. Thus, \u2018every man loves a\nwoman\u2019 has been argued (e.g., May 1977) to involve two distinct\nlogical forms. It has also been argued (see May 1985) to involve one\nthat is multiply interpretable with constrained but not determined\nquantifier scopes. \n\nA standard, but controversial, assumption is that LFs are the input to\nsemantic theory, not the phonological/orthographic objects we hear and\nsee. (see May 1985). Thus, while LFs may not be ambiguous, the\nsentences we actually use and assert often are. If this assumption\nturns out to be false, then it will be a great deal more difficult to\nlocate the source of some ambiguities.\n\nLFs can be represented as trees, and the terminal nodes of the\nbranches are taken from the lexicon. A lexicon is a repository of\nlexical items, which need not look like words and they certainly need\nnot correspond to our intuitions about words. Thus, intuitions about a\nword\u2019s modal profile suggest that it can undergo massive shifts\nin its orthographic and phonetic properties. It is far less clear that\nthe lexemes retain their identity over shifts of phonological\nproperties. We should be a bit careful, then, about the relationship\nbetween words and lexemes: a word may retain its identity while the\nlexeme it is derived from may not constitute it over time.\nFortunately, issues of concerning the diachronic identity of words\nwon\u2019t concern us much here.\n\nThe LF driven picture of semantic interpretation is controversial for\nmany reasons: some people don\u2019t think that LFs are properly\nthought of as inputs to anything, never mind semantic interpretation.\nCulicover and Jackendoff (2005) argue for much less extensive\nsyntactic structures coupled with very messy mappings to semantic (or\n\u2018conceptual\u2019) structures. Others think that most of the\nwork done by LFs could be done by taking a notion of surface syntax\nseriously, trading in syntactic structure for very complicated\nsemantic theories to account for the data. (Bittner 2007, Jacobson\n1999).  Thus, the description of some of the ambiguities as syntactic\nor structural rather than semantic can be somewhat controversial.\nHowever, everyone in the game needs something to serve as the input to\nsemantic interpretation and everyone needs some way to describe those\nstructures (if you don\u2019t, call me and let\u2019s talk about it\u2026) so\nhopefully similar points will hold in your preferred syntactic\nframework. We will highlight some of these controversies where\nnecessary.\n\nOne more clarification: ambiguity is a property of either sentences or\nperhaps the speech acts in which the sentences are used. But ambiguity\nof a sentence or sentences uttered does not necessarily result in\nany unclarity regarding what was expressed or meant by the speaker.\nThere is no guarantee that unambiguous utterances will result in full\nunivocal clear understanding either. In some syntactic contexts, the\nambiguity won\u2019t show up at all: \u2018I want to see you\nduck\u2019 is a case in which the NP interpretation of\n\u2018duck\u2019 is simply unavailable (especially with no comma\nafter \u2018you\u2019). In many cases our best theory predicts\nan ambiguity in the sentence used, without predicting confusion over\nhow the utterance ought to be interpreted. \n3.1 Lexical Ambiguity\n\nThe lexicon contains entries that are homophonous, or even co-spelled,\nbut differ in meanings and even syntactic categories.\n\u2018Duck\u2019 is both a verb and a noun as is\n\u2018cover\u2019. \u2018Bat\u2019 is a noun with two different\nmeanings and a verb with at least one meaning. \u2018Kick the\nbucket\u2019 is arguably ambiguous between one meaning involving\ndying and one meaning involving application of foot to bucket.\n\nThis sort of ambiguity is often very easy to detect by simple\nlinguistic reflection, especially when the meanings are wildly\ndistinct such as in the case of \u2018bat\u2019. It can be more\ndifficult, however, when the meanings are closely related. A classic\ncase is the short word \u2018in\u2019. The meaning(s) of\n\u2018in\u2019, if it is ambiguous, seem to crucially involve a\ngeneral notion of containment, but at a more fine-grained level, the\ntypes of containment can seem wildly distinct. One can be in therapy,\nin Florida, in the Mafia, in the yearbook\u2026but it seems like a\njoke to say that one is in therapy and the Mafia. \n\nThe considerations suggest that \u2018in\u2019 is ambiguous, but\nperhaps it is univocal with a very sense general meaning that involves\ncontainment of an appropriate sort and different objects require\ndifferent sorts of appropriate containment. Telling between these two\npossibilities is difficult. An even harder case of lexical ambiguity\ninvolves the putative ambiguity in \u2018any\u2019 between the\nreading as a universal quantifier and a \u2018free choice\u2019\nitem. (see Dayal 2004)\n\nA few points about lexical ambiguity should be kept in mind, so\nI\u2019ll repeat them. First, a bookkeeping issue: should we relegate\nlexical ambiguity to the lexicon (two non-identical entries for\nambiguous terms) or to semantic interpretation (one lexical entry, two\nor more meanings)? We\u2019ll go with the first option (so the two meanings\nof \u2018bank\u2019 correspond to two separate lexical items) but\nnothing I know of forces this choice. Second, the word/lexical item\ndistinction may cause us some trouble. While \u2018holey\u2019 and\n\u2018holy\u2019 are homophonous, they are not co-spelled. Thus an\nutterance of \u2018the temple is holey\u2019 is ambiguous between\ntwo sentences, while an inscription in English is not. Sometimes\nco-spelled words are distinct sounding, such as \u2018refuse\u2019\nwhich is distinct sounding (in my dialect at least) between\n\u2018ree-fuze\u2019 and \u2018reh-fuse\u2019. Fortunately, we\nhave the relevant categories to describe these differences and we can\ntalk about ambiguity in sound or in notation (or in sign).\n3.2 Syntactic Ambiguity\n\nSyntactic ambiguity occurs when there are many LFs that correspond to\nthe same sentence \u2013 assuming we don\u2019t think of sentences as\ndistinct if their LFs are distinct. This may be the result of scope,\nmovement or binding, and the level at which the ambiguity is localized\ncan involve full sentences or phrases. Here are some examples of\npurportedly syntactic ambiguities.\n3.2.1 Phrasal\n\nA phrase can be ambiguous by corresponding to distinct syntactic\nstructures. The classic example:\n\nsuperfluous hair remover\n\n\ncan mean the same as \u2018hair remover that is superfluous\u2019 or\n\u2018remover of hair that is superfluous\u2019. The ambiguity\nresults from the lack of representation of constituent structure in the English\nsentence, since it is unclear if the noun \u2018hair remover\u2019\nis modified by \u2018superfluous\u2019 in its specifier or if the\n \u2018superfluous hair\u2019 is the specifier of the noun\n\u2018remover\u2019. In current syntax, the phrase would be\nassociated with two different NPs.\n\nSimilarly, a phrase can be ambiguous between an adjunct and an\nargument:\n\nJohn floated the boat between the rocks.\n\n\n\u2018between the rocks\u2019 can modify the event of floating,\nsaying where it happened and thus acts as an adjunct. It can also act\nas an argument of \u2018float\u2019, specifying where the resulting\nlocation of the boat on account of the floating. It can also act as an\nadjunct modifying \u2018the boat\u2019, helping to specify which\nboat it is. All of these are readings of (1) and in each case we find\n\u2018between the rocks\u2019 playing very different roles. Assuming\nthese roles are dictated by their relations in the relevant LF, we get three very\ndifferent LFs that correspond to (1).\n\nThematic assignments can be similarly ambiguous at the level of LF\nwith deleted phrases:\n\nThe chicken is ready to eat.\n\n\n(2) can mean that the chicken is ready to be fed or to be fed to\nsomeone depending on the thematic assignment. In a popular semantic\nframework, this is because \u2018the chicken\u2019 is assigned agent\non one reading and patient on another. Arguably, these assignments is\ncorresponds syntactic phenomenon assuming principles that align\nthematic role and syntactic position (see Baker 1988, 1997; Williams\n1994; and Grimshaw 1990) but the semantic point stands either way.\nThey result in a clear ambiguity that we may term \u2018thematic\nambiguity\u2019 for present purposes.\n\nMultiple connectives present similar ambiguities. The following\nambiguity, for example, is borne directly out of failure to tell which\nconnective has widest scope:\n\nHe got drunk and fired or divorced.\n\n\nWe teach our students in propositional logic to disambiguate these\nwith brackets but we are not so lucky when it comes to the\northographic and phonetic groupings in natural language.\n\nAn interesting case is the semantics of modals. At least some modal\nauxiliaries and adverbs seem to allow for distinct senses such as\nmetaphysical, deontic, doxastic and perhaps practical. Consider\n\nJohn ought to be at home by now.\n\n\n(4) can mean that John\u2019s presence at home is, given everything\nwe know, guaranteed. It might mean that, though we have no idea where\nhe is, he is under the obligation to be at home. Similarly:\n\nThe coin might come up heads.\n\n\n(5) means that there is an open metaphysical possibility in which the\ncoin comes up heads. It also means that everything we know\ndoesn\u2019t tell us that the coin won\u2019t come up heads. On the\nlatter reading, for example, we can utter (5) truly even if we know\nthat the coin is weighted, but we aren\u2019t sure in which way.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nYou must eat a piece of cake.\n\n\n(6) can express a moral imperative: you are obliged morally to eat a\npiece of cake. It can express a practical obligation: given your\ntastes you\u2019d be remiss if you didn\u2019t eat a piece. Though\nthis would rarely make sense, (6) can suggest a doxastic certainty:\neverything we know entails that you won\u2019t fail to eat the\ncake.\n\nThe multiplicity of interpretation in these modals is pretty clear.\nOne particularly controversial case involves imperative vs epistemic\ninterpretations of \u2018must\u2019 as in \u2018He must be\nhere\u2019. However, whether or not it is a lexical or structural\nambiguity (or best treated as a case of univocality with indexicality)\nis a source of some controversy (see Drubig 2001). In the semantics\nliterature, views on which modalities are treated indexically rather\nthan as cases of ambiguity pretty much dominate all contemporary\nthinking, as we shall see in section 6.3.\n3.2.1 Quantifier and Operator Scope\n\nFinally, and of much interest to philosophers and logicians, there are\nscopal ambiguities involving operators and quantifiers. For example:\n\nEvery woman squeezed a man.\n\n\n(7) can express\n\n[\u2200x:Wx][\u2203y:My](x\nsqueezed y)\n\n\n(In regimented English: For every womani there is at least\none man that shei squeezed.)\n\nOr\n\n[\u2203y:My][\u2200x:Wx](x\nsqueezed y)\n\n\n(In regimented English: There is at least one mani who is\nsuch that every womanj squeezed himi.)\n\nThese ambiguities can be very difficult to hear in some cases. For\nexample:\n\nSomeone is in a car accident every 10 seconds.\n\n\nNo one is tempted to hear the reading of (10) that involves an unlucky\ndriver who is constantly in car accidents. Thus, our best theory may\ndetermine an ambiguity that is never the intended meaning of an \nutterance of the ambiguous sentence. If we were able to revive people\nfrequently and very quickly and immediately get them into cars , we would presumably start to consider the currently\npragmatically unavailable reading of (10) more seriously.\n\nOperators have scopal interactions with quantifiers as well. The\nsemantics of modal auxiliaries, adverbs, temporal modifiers and tense\nare the subject of much concern but one thing is clear: they have\ninteractive effects.\n\nModal and temporal fallacies abound if we aren\u2019t careful about\nscope:\n\n(P1)\nJohn is a bachelor.\n(P2)\nAll bachelors are necessarily unmarried.\n(C)\nTherefore John is necessarily unmarried.\n\n\nIf we allow \u2018necessarily\u2019 to have \u2018bachelors\u2019\netc. within its scope, P2 is true but the conclusion is not entailed.\nIf the modal is interpreted narrowly, the conclusion follows but P2 is\nfalse and so is the conclusion.\n\nThere is a great deal of controversy over how scope is to be handled.\nOrthodoxy suggests movement of quantifiers at LF where quantifier\nscope is made explicit and unambiguous. May (1985) is often cited as\nthe canonical source for this \u2013 but it is worth noting that in\nthat work May treats some LFs as underdetermining some semantic scopal\nrelations. The situation is less clear with temporal and modal (and\nother) operators: many semantic theories treat tense and temporal\nadverbs as quantifiers, while some treat modal expression in this\nmanner. Other treat them as the operators or adverbs they appear to\nbe. One respectable semantic tradition sees (P2) as ambiguous, for\nexample, between:\n\n[\u2200w][\u2200x:Bachelor(w,x)](Unmarried(x,w))\n\n\n(In regimented English: Every world is such that every bachelor at\nthat world is unmarried at that world.)\n\nAnd\n\n[\u2200x:Bachelor(w,x)][\u2200w\u2032](Unmarried\n(x,w\u2032))\n\n\n(In regimented English: Every bachelor at a world is such that at\nevery world he is a bachelor.)\n\nOn the first reading, the world-quantifier takes wide scope. On the\nsecond, the bachelor-quantifier takes wide scope and the world\nvariable is unbound. On the operator treatment, we dispose of\nquantification over worlds and let the predicates be interpreted\nrelative to the operators, perhaps as a matter of movement, perhaps by\nother semantic means.\n\nNegation has similarly been argued to present interesting scope\nambiguities (see Russell (1905) for an early example of a\nphilosophical use of this type of ambiguity). The following, according\nto Russell, is ambiguous:\n\nThe present king of France is not bald.\n\n\nAs is:\n\nAll that glitters is not gold.\n\n\nRussell claims that (13) and (14) are ambiguous between a reading on which negation that scopes over\nthe sentence as a whole and one reading on which it scopes under the determiner\nphrase and over the predicate (though see Strawson (1950) See also Neale (1990)).\n\nLong story short, of great interest to philosophers are these sorts of\nscope worries as many an argument has been accused of looking\nconvincing because of a scope ambiguity (the causal argument for\nGod\u2019s existence, the ontological argument). The development of\nlogics capable of handling multiple quantification was an achievement\nin part because they could sort out just this sort of linguistic\nphenomenon.\n\nOne final note: even in the domain of scopal ambiguities, there are\ncontroversies about whether to treat (some of) these apparent ambiguities as\nambiguities. Pietroski and Hornstein (2002) argue that many of these\ncases aren\u2019t ambiguities at all and prefer a pragmatic\nexplanation of the multiple readings. \n3.2.2 Pronouns\n\nBound and unbound readings of pronouns give rise to similar problems,\nthough whether this is a semantic, syntactic or pragmatic ambiguity\nhas been the source of heated debate. If I tell you \u2018everyone\nloves his mother\u2019, the sentence may be interpreted with\n\u2018his\u2019 being co-indexed with \u2018everyone\u2019 and\nyielding different mothers (potentially) for different values of\n\u2018everyone\u2019 or it could be interpreted deictically saying\nthat everyone loves that [appropriate demonstration] guy\u2019s\nmother. Static semantics usually treats the distinction between bound\nand free pronouns as a fundamental ambiguity; dynamic semantics\nrelegates the distinction to an ambiguity in variable choice (see Heim\n1982, 1983, and Kamp 1981).\n\nThe phenomenon is subject to syntactic constraints. We have a good\nidea of the conditions under which we can fail to get bound readings,\nas characterized by binding theory. Thus, we know that binding is\nimpossible in cross-over cases and cases where pronouns are \u2018too\nclose\u2019 to their binder ((15) is a case of \u2018weak\ncrossover\u2019, (16) is a case of \u2018strong crossover\u2019 and\n(17) is a violation of principle B of binding theory):\n\n?His1 mother loves John1.\n*He1 loves John1.\n*John1 loves him1.\n\n\nHowever, the impossibility of these readings demonstrates constraints\non interpretation. It doesn\u2019t resolve the ambiguity in\nsentences where violations of binding theory do not occur. \n3.3 Pragmatic Ambiguity\n\nPragmatics has been claimed to be the study of many different things;\nbut for our purposes we can focus on two: speech acts and truth conditional pragmatics. \n3.3.1 Speech Acts\n\nSpeech act theory is complicated and it is not easy to offer a neutral\naccount of the typology or interpretation of speech acts. But,\nintuitively, an utterance (locutionary act) of the sentence \u2018The\ncops are coming\u2019 can be an assertion, a warning, or an\nexpression of relief. \u2018I\u2019m sorry you were raised so\nbadly\u2019 can be an assertion or an apology. \u2018You want to\ncook dinner\u2019 can function as a request or as an\nassertion. \u2018Can you pick me up later?\u2019 can function as a\nrequest or a question or both. And these are just examples of speech\nacts that are conventionally tied to these sentence forms. Many, if\nnot all, sentences can be used in multiple ways.\n\nInterestingly, these ambiguities are not always signaled by the\ncontent of the sentence. For example the following differ in their\npotential for use in speech acts though they seem to express similar\ncontent:\n\nCan you pass the salt?\nAre you able to pass the salt?\n\n\nSome creativity may allow (19) to function as a request but it is very\ndifficult compared to (18). As such, some theorists have been\ninterested in trying to determine whether sentence types constrain the\nspeech act potential of utterances of them (see Murray and Starr\n(2018) for an overview). \n3.3.2 Pragmatic Ambiguity\n\nAn interesting case of ubiquitous potential ambiguity is the notion, suggested by Donnellan (1966), that\nthe apparent referential use of some sentences with definite\ndescriptions. Donnellan writes:\n\nIt does not seem possible to say categorically of a definite\ndescription in a particular sentence that it is a referring expression\n(of course, one could say this if he meant that it might be used to\nrefer). In general, whether or not a definite description is used\nreferentially or attributively is a function of the speaker\u2019s\nintentions in a particular case. \u2026 Nor does it seem at all\nattractive to suppose an ambiguity in the meaning of the words; it\ndoes not appear to be semantically ambiguous. (Perhaps we could say\nthat the sentence is pragmatically ambiguous \u2026.) (Donnellan, p.\n297)\n\n\nPhilosophers puzzled a great deal over the import of a\n\u2018pragmatic\u2019 ambiguity that wasn\u2019t a speech act\nambiguity or perhaps an ambiguity in what a speaker implies by\nuttering a sentence. Kripke (1977) and Searle (1979: p. 150 fn. 3)\nclaim that pragmatic ambiguity is conceptually confused \u2013 either\nthe sentence bears two interpretations and there is a vanilla\nambiguity or the sentence used in univocal but the speaker is using it\nto get across a different or additional piece of information. But the\nintuition that perhaps pragmatics has a great role to play in\ninterpretation than merely an account of inferences licensed by the\nneeds of conversational coherence has led philosophers to consider\nwhat ambiguity that resides in the interface of semantics and\npragmatics might look like (see Recanati (2010).\n3.3.3 Presuppositional Ambiguity\n\nAmbiguity can be found at the level of presupposition, terms of\nidentifying the presupposition triggered by a sentence/utterance, as\nwell. The case of \u2018too\u2019 is instructive. It has long been\nobserved that the word \u2018too\u2019 triggers presuppositions, as\nin:\n\nMaria solved the problem too.\n\n\nIt\u2019s natural on first read to think that (20) carries the\npresupposition that someone else solved the problem. But that need not\nbe the case: it may presuppose that Maria solved the problem as well\nas having done something else, as in:\n\nMaria came up with the problem. Maria solved the problem too.\n\n\nKent Bach (1982) explores the intriguing case of:\n\nI love you too.\n\n\nThis can mean (at least) one of four distinct things:\n\nI love you (just like you love me)\nI love you (just like someone else does)\nI love you (and I love someone else)\nI love you (as well as bearing some other relationship (i.e.\nadmiring) to you)\n\n\nIf none of these are true, \u2018I love you too\u2019 is clearly\ninfelicitous.\n3.4 Other Interesting Cases\n3.4.1 Pros Hen Ambiguity\n\nAristotle noticed in Metaphysics \u03932 that some words are related\nin meaning but subtly distinct in what they imply. He thought that\n\u2018being\u2019 was like this and he illustrates his point with\nexamples such as \u2018health\u2019:\n\n\nThere are many senses in which a thing may be said to\n\u2018be\u2019, but all that \u2018is\u2019 is related to one\ncentral point, one definite kind of thing, and is not said to\n\u2018be\u2019 by a mere ambiguity. Everything which is healthy is\nrelated to health, one thing in the sense that it preserves health,\nanother in the sense that it produces it, another in the sense that it\nis a symptom of health, another because it is capable of it.\n(Metaphysics \u03932)\n\n\nThe idea here is that there are words like \u2018health\u2019 (and,\nif Aristotle is right, \u2018being\u2019) that are ambiguous between\na \u2018primary\u2019 sense of \u2018healthy\u2019 is that which\napplies to things that can enjoy health, such as people, dogs, plants,\nand perhaps corporations but also a \u2018secondary\u2019 sense that\ninvolves promoting or signaling the presence of health in the primary\nsense.  For example, your diet may be healthy not because it is\nfailing to suffer from a disease but because it promotes your\nhealth. Your doctor may tell you that you have healthy urine on\naccount of it being a positive indication of your health. This\nambiguity is special in that the derivative senses of\n\u2018health\u2019 are all defined in terms of the more primary\nsense of \u2018health\u2019.  The linguistic context doesn\u2019t always\nsettle which sense of is at play: \u2018dogs are healthy pets\u2019\ncan both mean that dogs tend to be themselves healthy and that dogs\ntend to promote health in their owners.\n3.4.2 Collective-Distributive Ambiguity\n\nAnother interesting ambiguity is the collective-distributive ambiguity that\noccurs in the case of some predicates with certain quantificational or\nconjunctive antecedents. Consider:\n\nThe politicians lifted the piano.\nSam and Jess brokered deals.\n\n\n(27) enjoys a collective reading on which the piano lifting is true of\nthe politicians collectively but not true of any particular politician\nand a similar ambiguity is present in (28). They also have\ndistributive readings involving as many liftings of the piano as there\nwere politicians and at least two different deal brokerings\nrespectively. See section (4.1) for relevant considerations.\n3.4.3 Ellipsis and Complement Ambiguity\n\nAn interesting case of ambiguity comes from ellipsis. The following is\nclearly ambiguous:\n\nJohn loves his mother and Bill does too.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve already discussed the bound/unbound ambiguity inherent in\n\u2018John loves his mother\u2019. Consider the bound reading of the\nfirst sentence. Now, on that reading, there are still two\ninterpretations of the second sentence to deal with: one on which Bill\nloves John\u2019s mother and one on which Bill loves his own. This\nambiguity has been given the regrettable name \u2018strict-sloppy\nidentity\u2019 and seems to be the result of what \u2018does\ntoo\u2019 is short form for. There is a long-standing debate over\nwhether the mechanism is primarily one of copying over at LF (Fiengo\nand May 1994), the result of expressing a lambda-abstracted predicate\n(Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977) or the result of centering on a discourse\nreferent (see Hardt and Stone 1997). Ambiguities can arise from words that\naren\u2019t written or said as well as from ones that are.\n\nSimilar ambiguities come up in cases such as:\n\nSam loves Jess more than Jason.\n\n\n(30) can mean either that Sam loves Jess more than he loves Jason or\nthat Sam loves Jess more than Jason loves Jess. This ambiguity arises\nfrom phrasal and clausal comparatives: the phrasal comparative of\n\u2018more than\u2019 takes a noun phrase and relates Jess and Jason\n(effectively saying that the degree to which Sam loves Jess exceeds\nthe degree to which he loves Jason). On the other hand, one can read\n(30) as involving ellipsis in which \u2018loves Jess\u2019 is\nstripped from the complement of Jason and left sotto\nvoce.\n3.4.4 Flexible Types\n\nMontague (Montague 1973) held to a policy of holding fixed the\nsemantic type of lexical items by their category, so that names,\nfalling in the same category as quantifier phrases, were assigned the\nsame type as quantifier phrases. Otherwise, he reasoned, there would\nbe a type mismatch when we conjoined names and quantifier phrases.\nOthers, however, have been content to posit ambiguities in type for\none and the same expression. Thus, we may posit that\n\u2018John\u2019, when the word occurs alone, is of type\n\u27e8e\u27e9 (entity referring) but when conjoined with\n\u2018every man\u2019, it is of type\n\u27e8\u27e8e,t\u27e9,t\u27e9 (a function\nfrom functions to truth values) just like quantifier phrases. The\nsemantics is carefully rigged so as not to make a truth-conditional\ndifference; but there is ambiguity nonetheless in what names literally\nexpress.\n\nThere are alternatives. We could retain the univocality of names and\ntreat \u2018and\u2019 as flexible in type depending on its\narguments. We could also treat \u2018and\u2019 as a type-shifter.\nSimilar considerations hold for verb phrases. Whether or not there is\nan ambiguity present in such cases is likely to be determined by very\nhigh level considerations, not by competent speakers ability to detect\na difference in intuitive meaning.\n3.4.5 Generic vs. Non-Generic Readings\n\nSome terms are ambiguous between a generic and non-generic reading,\nand the sentences they play into are similarly ambiguous between the\ntwo readings. For example:\n\nDinosaurs ate kelp. (Carlson 1982: p. 163)\n\n\n(31) is clearly ambiguous between a generic reading (equivalent\nroughly to \u2018dinosaurs were kelp-eaters\u2019) and a\nnon-generic, episodic reading (equivalent to \u2018there were some\ndinosaurs that ate some kelp\u2019). The ambiguity can be located\nwith certain predicates as well:\n\nJohn ate breakfast with a gold fork.\n\n\nThe habitual reading (describing how John favored utensil for eating\nbreakfast) vs. the episodic reading (describing a particular breakfast\nJohn ate) is evident in (32).\n3.4.6 Inchoative Alternations\n\nThe following sentences are obviously related:\n\nI broke the vase.\nThe vase broke.\n\n\n\u2018Broke\u2019 and other words like it (e.g.,\n\u2018boiled\u2019) have double lives as transitive and intransitive\nverbs. This could encourage one to posit an ambiguity (or a polysemy)\nsince the putative lexical entries are closely related. However, that\nwould be awfully quick: another approach is to take words like\n\u2018broke\u2019 as playing two distinct syntactic roles\nunivocally, where the root \u2018broke\u2019 is a monadic predicate\nof events. Another is to take \u2018broke\u2019 to be univocal and\nallow the object to move into subject position. Whether or not the\nterm is ambiguous lexically depends a great deal on which theory of\nthe inchoative turns out to be right.\n3.4.7 Granularity\n\nYet another systematic (seeming) ambiguity corresponds roughly\nto the type-token distinction that philosophers cherish, though it is\nmore general. Philosophers have noticed that (35) is ambiguous between\na type and a token reading:\n\nI paid for the same car.\n\n\n(35) can express a complaint that a car was paid for twice or the\nclaim that I now own a car that is like yours. How closely they have\nto correspond in similarity is an open question. But interestingly,\nthe two senses cannot always be accessed felicitously:\n\n?I skidded on ice and hit the same car.\n\n\nOne cannot read (36) as saying, say, that my Honda hit another Honda.\nIt\u2019s tempting to think that \u2018same\u2019 is the culprit,\nallowing for sameness across different levels of grain from the very\nfine to the very coarse. The phenomenon is quite wide-spread, however\n(See Hobbs 1985).\n3.4.8 Count/Mass Nouns\n\nAnother ambiguity, though perhaps best thought\nof as polysemy due to the similarity of the meanings, concerns count\nnouns like \u2018(one) chicken\u2019 and mass nouns like, say, \u2018(a lot of)\nchicken\u2019. David Lewis used the idea of a universal grinder (reported\nby Pelletier in his (1975)) to suggest that we can make sense of mass\nuses of substantive count nouns \u2013 apply the imaginary grinder to,\nsay, three guitars and you can then make sense of:\n\nThere was guitar all over the floor.\n\n\nThe possibility of grinding out mass nouns with the universal grinder\nis limited to predicates that refer to things we can imagine being\ngrindable in their extensions \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see how one\ngets a mass interpretation of \u2018melody\u2019 by grinding. The\napplicability of the universal grinder, moreover, is not\nlinguistically universal in its ability to imbue one and the same noun\nwith a mass interpretation.  The count/mass distinction concerns, in\npart, whether nouns supply a criterion for counting (explaining why\ncount nouns play well with numerical determiners). Thus, continuing\nour example of ground guitars, notice that (38) doesn\u2019t entail\nand isn\u2019t entailed by (39):\n\nJohn picked up more guitars than Sarah.\nJohn picked up more guitar than Sarah.\n\n\nThis doesn\u2019t hold for, say \u2018footwear\u2019 and\n\u2018shoes\u2019 where owing more shoes entails owning more\nfootwear and vice versa. See Doetjes (2011) for discussion.\n3.4.9 Discourse Relations\n\nMuch recent work has gone into trying to give informative\nexplanations of the oddity of discourses such as:\n\n?Raskolnikov killed Alyona. The tacos at Lalos are delicious.\n A standard Gricean response to this oddity is that (40) is odd\nbecause the second sentence fails to be relevant to the first, and\nthus uncooperative (unless the speaker wants to signal a hidden\nconnection between the tacos and the murder). This seems like a\npromising start but the injunction to be relevant fails to provide\nenough theoretical options to explain other transitions between\nsentences. For example (due to Hobbs 1979):\n\n\nPeter picked the lock. He learned how from Jason.\nPeter picked the lock and he learned how from Jason.\n An utterance (41) strongly conveys the information that Jason\u2019s\nteaching Peter is what explains the lock picking. No such inference\nseems available in (42), in which the learning to lock pick seems\n(strangely) to temporally follow the lock picking. It\u2019s difficult to\nsee how the period vs. \u2018and\u2019 distinction could be responsible for\nthis. Moreover, much empirical work has been done to show that the\nmanner in which we interpret sentences as connected in a discourse\neffects how we resolve the reference of anaphora. For example (Smyth\n(1994)):\n\n\nPhil tickled Stanley, and Liz poked him.\n\n\nClearly, the \u2018him\u2019 in (43) can be interpreted as Phil\nor Stanley. But, crucially, how you interpret \u2018him\u2019 will\ndepend on how you connect the two sentences. On the one hand, the\ninterpretation of \u2018him\u2019 as referring to Phil goes hand in\nhand with a causal relation \u2013 its was the tickling that caused\nthe poking (known as a result relation. Interpreting\n\u2018him\u2019 as referring to Stanley suggests goes hand in hand\nwith a parallel relation. Of course the inference is defeasible\n\u2013 one can always break the connection between discourse relation\nand pronoun resolution in a manner that looks much like cancellation\nfor Griceans (\u2018\u2026Liz poked him, I mean, Phil, for\nunrelated reasons\u2019). But the point is that the search for\ndiscourse relations that help settle pronominal reference is good\nevidence that the discourse relations are part of your linguistic\nknowledge, not just a reflect of cooperative conversation and maxim\nfollowing or flaunting.  The study of discourse relations has\nflourished into a large literature in the last 20 years but the\nrelevant point for us is that it looks like (43) is ambiguous as a\ndiscourse. This type of ambiguity is fairly novel and much work is\nstill needed to get clear on the number and nature of possible\nrelations that provide the possible resolutions of ambiguities like\n(41).\n\n4. Detecting Ambiguity\n\nNow that we have separated types of ambiguity, we may reasonably ask\nhow we tell when a term or phrase contains an ambiguity. The answer\nmay be disappointing \u2013 there are tests and considerations but no\nfirm answers and probably a lot depends on what the \u2018best\ntheories\u2019 in linguistics etc. end up looking like. Nevertheless,\nwe can make some progress. The canonical source for these tests is\nZwicky and Sadock\u2019s \u2018Ambiguity Tests and How to Fail\nThem\u2019 (1975).\n\nThese tests generally depend on the presence or lack of\ninterpretations and on judgments regarding the ridiculousness of\ninterpretation (the absurdity of the meaning is known as\nzeugma \u2013 though it should probably be known as syllepsis). These\njudgments can be difficult to make, especially in tricky philosophical\ncases, so we must treat the results of the tests with care.\n4.1 Conjunction Reduction\n\nA standard test for ambiguity is to take two sentences that contain\nthe purportedly ambiguous term and conjoin them by using the term only\nonce in contexts where both meanings are encouraged. For example,\n\u2018light\u2019 is a predicate that can enjoy the same meaning as\neither \u2018not dark\u2019 or \u2018not heavy\u2019.\n\nThe colours are light.\nThe feathers are light.\n\n\nThe following, however, seems to be zeugmatic:\n\n?The colours and the feathers are light.\n\n\nThe reduced sentence is zeugmatic for obvious reasons. This is\nevidence for ambiguity (or polysemy) in \u2018light\u2019. On the\nother hand, \u2018exist\u2019, which has been claimed to be\nambiguous, seems not to display such zeugmatic effects:\n\nToronto exists.\nNumbers exist.\nTriadic relations exist.\nToronto and numbers and triadic relations exist.\n\n\nThe test is limited in one way. If a term can be ambiguous but in a\nway so subtle that competent speakers may miss it, then the zeugma might not be\nnoticeable. Given that these tests try to draw on linguistic judgments\nto detect ambiguity, it\u2019s not clear how to proceed when there is\na case of disagreement over the presence of zeugma.\n\nWe can use the test in cases in which one wouldn\u2019t necessarily\nexpect zeugma, but merely lack of multiple interpretations. For\nexample:\n\nHan and Chewbacca used superfluous hair removers.\n\n\n(51) doesn\u2019t allow a reading on which Han used a hair remover\nthat was superfluous and Chewbacca used a remover of superfluous hair.\nIf multiple interpretations are impossible, there is evidence of\nambiguity. This is to be expected since the point of conjunction\nreduction is to \u2018freeze\u2019 the syntactic structure and in\nambiguous cases, the effect is achieved.\n\nAs mentioned above, conjunction reduction has been used to argue that\ncollective-distributive ambiguities are due to an ambiguity in the\nsubject phrase. Consider:\n\nJohn and Jane moved a piano.\n\n\nOne might think that the readings are generated by an ambiguity in\n\u2018and\u2019: sometimes it acts as a sentential operator and\nsometimes as a term-forming operator that makes two names into a\nsingle term for predication. However, notice that there are some\npredicates that can only be (sensibly) interpreted collectively, such\nas \u2018met\u2019:\n\nJohn and Jane met for lunch.\n\n\nIn this case, there is no sense to be made of \u2018John met for\nlunch and Jane met for lunch\u2019 and so the sentential conjunction\nreading is not available. Using conjunction reduction on (52) and (53)\nwe get:\n\nJohn and Jane moved a piano and met for lunch.\n\n\n(54) has a reading on which \u2018moved the piano\u2019 is\ninterpreted distributively (two liftings) and \u2018met\u2019 is\nread collectively. The felicity of the conjunction reduced (54)\nsuggests that the ambiguity isn\u2019t the result of an ambiguity in\nconjunction. (see Schein (2006), McKay (2006)). We can try to use\nthe test in an extended manner on full sentences if we embed them\nunder \u2018says that\u2019 or perhaps \u2018believes that\u2019:\n\u2018John and Adam believe that Sarah bought a superfluous hair\nremover\u2019 is infelicitous if the unconjoined sentences involve\ndifferent interpretations of \u2018superfluous hair\nremover\u2019.\n\nThe test has certain weaknesses. In actual utterances, intonation can\nbe used to indicate an assertion or an each question (\u2018Ben\nwanted to eat that?) conjoined with \u2018Ben wanted to eat\nthat\u2019 yields an infelicity even if the demonstrative has the\nsame value on both occasions \u2013 though we may try to fix things up\nby demanding that the test be run using common intonation (at least in\nspoken uses of the test!). On that note, the test will judge\ndemonstrative and indexicals to be ambiguous since they are famously\nnot generally conjunction reducible. Similar worries concern polysemy and ambiguity, which conjunction reduction may be overly sensitive to (See Viebahn (2016) for relevant considerations).\n4.2 Ellipsis\n\nEllipsis tests work in a manner similar to conjunction reduction\ntests. For example:\n\nI saw his duck and swallow under the table and I saw hers too.\n(Zwicky and Sadock 1975)\n\n\n(55) can mean that I saw their birds under the table or that I saw\ntheir activities of ducking and swallowing but it can\u2019t mean\nthat I saw one\u2019s birds and the other\u2019s activities. Similar\nfeatures hold for structural ambiguities:\n\nI\u2019m happy that every man met two women and Jim is too.\n\n\nIt isn\u2019t possible to interpret (56) as having \u2018every\nman\u2019 with wide scope in one but narrow in the other. This\nsuggests a real ambiguity in the scope of the two quantifiers. This\ntest has led people some philosophers to surprising results. For\nexample, Atlas (1989) argues that the acceptability of the following\nsuggest that negation does not interact scopally with descriptions in\nthe ways we have come to expect:\n\nJohn thinks that the King of France is not bald and Bob thinks so\ntoo.\n\n\nThe purported availability of both readings suggests that sentences\nwith negation(s) and descriptions are sense-general rather than\nambiguous, contradicting many standard assumptions about the\navailable truth conditions these structures should make available. Alternatively, it may lead us to\nthink that there weren\u2019t as many readings as we initially\nthought there were (or that we have the wrong theory of\ndescriptions).\n4.3 Contradiction Tests\n\nAnother way to test for ambiguity is to test for lack of contradiction\nin sentences that look to be contradictory. For example, say someone\nargued that \u2018aunt\u2019 was ambiguous on account of not\nspecifying maternal from paternal aunt. If that was the case, we would\nexpect that we can access the two distinct senses of\n\u2018aunt\u2019 just as we can for \u2018bank\u2019. However,\ncompare:\n\nThat bank isn\u2019t a bank.\n*She is an aunt but she isn\u2019t an aunt.\n\n\nBoth sentences are rather awkward but only one is doomed to\nlife as a contradiction. This is good evidence that \u2018aunt\u2019 is\nunspecified with respect to which side of the family she comes from,\nbut not ambiguous. The tests can be used for most of the other types\nof ambiguity:\n\nMy superfluous hair remover is not a superfluous hair remover; (I\nneed it!)\nThe goose is ready to eat but it\u2019s not ready to eat; (we\nneed to cook it first.)\n\n\n(It helps to provide a paraphrase afterwards to bring out the distinct\nsenses). The tests can be used to detect lexical, structural and\nthematic ambiguity.\n4.4 Definitional Tests\n\nAristotle offers a test for ambiguity: try to construct a definition\nthat encompasses both meanings and posit an ambiguity only if you\nfail. The notion of definition here has to be taken as a heavy-weight\nnotion: \u2018bank\u2019 is ambiguous even though you can\n\u2018define\u2019 it as \u2018financial institution or river\nside\u2019. However, we can get a reasonable grip on what Aristotle\nhad in mind. \u2018Uncle\u2019 is not ambiguous because it has a\nsingle definition that covers both: x is an uncle iff\nx is the brother of y and y has a\nchild. \n\nThe test depends partly on how strict we are about what counts as a\ndefinition. And on the assumption that there are interesting\ndefinitions to be had (see Fodor 1998).\n4.5 Checking the Lexicon of Other Languages\n\nKripke, in his famous attack on Donnellan, suggests a few tests for\nambiguity that are more conceptual in nature. In particular, he makes\nthe following intriguing suggestion:\n\n\n\u201cBank\u201d is ambiguous; we would expect the ambiguity to be\ndisambiguated by separate and unrelated words in some other languages.\nWhy should the two separate senses be reproduced in languages\nunrelated to English? First, then, we can consult our linguistic\nintuitions, independently of any empirical investigation. Would we be\nsurprised to find languages that used two separate words for the two\nalleged senses of a given word? If so, then, to that extent our\nlinguistic intuitions are really intuitions of a unitary concept,\nrather than of a word that expresses two distinct and unrelated\nsenses. Second, we can ask empirically whether languages are in fact\nfound that contain distinct words expressing the allegedly distinct\nsenses. If no such language is found, once again this is evidence that\na unitary account of the word or phrase in question should be sought.\n(Kripke 1977: p. 268)\n\n\nIn other words, since lexical ambiguity should involve something like\naccidental homophony, one would expect that other languages would\nlexicalize these meanings differently. Thus, it would not surprise one\nto find out that the two meanings of \u2018bat\u2019 were expressed\nby two different words in other languages. It may well surprise one to\nfind out that every action verb was lexicalized as two different\nverbs, one for a reading on which the action was done intentionally,\none on which it wasn\u2019t in some other language.\n\nOne may worry about this test, especially with respect to its ability to\ndifferentiating sense generality from ambiguity. It would not be\nsurprising to find out that other languages lexicalize\n\u2018uncle\u2019 in two different words (in Croatian, there is no\none word translation of \u2018uncle\u2019: \u2018stric\u2019 means\nbrother of one\u2019s father and \u2018ujak\u2019 means an uncle\nfrom the mother\u2019s side). Nonetheless, there is no reason to\nthink that \u2018uncle\u2019 is ambiguous in English. Why\nwouldn\u2019t language users create words to designate the specific\nmeanings that are left sense-general in a different language?\n4.6 Problems for the Tests\n4.6.1 Privative Opposites\n\nZwicky and Sadock (1975) argue that sometimes the two (or more)\nputative meanings of a word are related by overlapping except with\nrespect to one or more features. The Random House Dictionary, for\nexample, gives (amongst many others) the following two definitions for\n\u2018dog\u2019:\n\nany carnivore of the dog family Canidae, having prominent canine\nteeth and, in the wild state, a long and slender muzzle, a\ndeep-chested muscular body, a bushy tail, and large, erect ears.\nCompare canid.\nthe male of such an animal.\n\n\nIgnoring for now whether or not dictionaries manage to report\nanalyticities (is having a bushy tail really an analytic necessary\ncondition for being a dog?), it looks like sense (ii) and (iii) differ\nmerely by specification of gender, and so if this makes for ambiguity,\nit may well be hard to test for. Similarly for verbs that allow a\nfactive and non-factive reading such as \u2018report\u2019 where the\nfactive reading entails the non-factive. If I say \u2018the police\nreported that the criminal was apprehended but the police didn\u2019t\nreport that the criminal was apprehended\u2019 there is at least one\nreading that is anomalous, but largely out of contradiction engendered\nby entailment rather than univocality: it takes subtle intuitions to\ntrain one\u2019s ear to hear ambiguities when the meanings are\nlargely overlapping. As mentioned above, Pietroski and Hornstein\n(2002) make a similar point regarding syntactic ambiguities. Noting\nthat the two putative readings of \u2018every man loves a\nwoman\u2019 are such that the wide scope \u2018a woman\u2019\nreading entails the narrow, they ask whether or not we should be\ncountenancing a structural ambiguity or chalking up the two\n\u2018readings\u2019 to confusion over the specific and general\ncase. If these sorts of factors can interfere, we will indeed have to\napply our tests gingerly.\n4.6.2 The Inconsistency of Zeugma\n\nA problem for the conjunction reduction test involves the\ncontext-sensitivity of zeugma. As noted by Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk\n(following Cruse 1986), the following two are different in terms of\nzeugma:\n\n?Judy\u2019s dissertation is thought provoking and yellowed with\nage.\nJudy\u2019s dissertation is still thought provoking although\nyellowed with age.\n\n\nSimilarly, from the literature on generics:\n\nBees thrive in warm environments and hence are swarming my\nporch.\n\n\nThese cases looks like a problem for the conjunction reduction test,\ndepending on how one thinks we should treat the ambiguity in generics.\nOne might think that this provides evidence against ambiguity in bare\nplurals.\n4.7 Contextual Resolution and Degree of Zeugma\n\nAs we suggested above, context-sensitivity, vagueness and indexicality\nare frequently thought to be different phenomena than ambiguity,\nrequiring a different treatment than lexical proliferation or\ndifferences in structure. However, in context, it can be pretty easy\nto make them pass some of the tests for ambiguity. For example,\nconsider James, who wants to meet a man who is is tall for a\nphilosopher, and Jane who wants to meet a man who is tall for a\nhorse jockey (who tend to be a fair bit shorter on average). Let\u2019s\nconjunction reduce and see what happens:\n\n?James and Jane want to meet a tall man.\n\n\nAdmittedly, (65) strikes me as meriting a \u2018?\u2019 rather than\na \u2018#\u2019, but I am unwilling to let it escape\nunmarked. Let\u2019s try another case.  Consider, James speaking to\nJill and disagreeing over the relevant height required to be tall:\n\n?That mani is tall but hei\u2019s not\ntall.\n\n\nIt\u2019s possible, I think, to get a non-contradictory reading of\n(66). But it requires, to my ear, adding a good helping of\nfocal stress on the second \u2018tall\u2019. Of course, putting\nfocal stress on a word has semantic effects of its own. So we\ndon\u2019t have clear counter-examples to the tests here. But we do have\nsome evidence that running the tests requires controlling for\nvariables.\n\nSimilarly, speaker\u2019s reference and semantic reference\ndistinctions mentioned above can interfere with the proper operation\nof the tests. Let\u2019s consider a variant on Kripke\u2019s famous\ncase. We see someone who looks like Smith (but is Jones) raking the\nleaves and someone else sees Smith (the actual Smith) raking leaves.\nCan we hear the following as non-zeugmatic?\n\nWe saw Smith raking the leaves and he did too.\n\n\nIn context, this sounds awfully bad to me. It doesn\u2019t seem,\nhowever, that the word \u2018Smith\u2019 is ambiguous in sometimes\nreferring to Jones, sometimes Smith. The utterance of the word \u2018Smith\u2019\nhowever, may well be used with referential intentions that lead to\nutterance ambiguity. \n\nThe bottom line is that in clear cases, the tests work great. In\ncontroversial cases, one must be very careful and run many of them and\nhope for the best; it will sometimes involve sifting through degrees\nof zeugma rather than triumphantly producing an indisputable\nresult.\n4.8 Metaphor and Non-Literal Usage\n\nMetaphor and non-literal usage can also confound the tests. For\nexample:\n\n#We saw Zoe down in the dumps and her therapist did\ntoo.\n#Life and the 401 are highways.\n\n\nThe metaphors aren\u2019t very good and (68) and (69) are clearly\nzeugmatic. Given how many parts of speech can be used metaphorically,\nslavish obedience to the test would postulate massive and\nunconstrained ambiguity in natural language. (See Camp 2006) The\nnatural answer is to restrict the use of the test to cases in which\nthe words are used literally; but of course the tests are supposed to\nhelp us decide when we have literal, semantic difference and when we\ndon\u2019t. To add to the complication, metaphors that are used in\nsimilar manners over time tend to become \u2018dead\u2019\nmetaphors \u2013 literally ambiguities that took a causal path through\nmetaphor. \u2018Deadline\u2019 is a pretty clear case of a metaphor\nthat has died. Since the passing of the non-literal into the\nstandardized literal is not exactly a transition whose time of\noccurrence is obvious, it will be difficult in some cases to tell what\nhas been lexicalized as a different meaning and what has not (think,\nagain, of \u2018deadline\u2019 as a case, which once meant a line\nthe crossing of which would result in your death. Think of that next\ntime you are late with a paper\u2026) \n5. Philosophical Issues\n\nThere are a few main philosophical issues involved in ambiguity.\n5.1 Validity\n\nMany arguments look persuasive but fail on closer inspection on\naccount of structural and/or lexical ambiguity. For example,\nconsider:\n\nBabe Ruth owned a bat.\nBats have wings.\nBabe Ruth owned something with wings.\n\n\nThe argument looks valid and the premises seem true, on at\nleast one reading, but the conclusion doesn\u2019t follow.\n\nIf logic is to be free of issues that would complicate telling valid\nfrom non-valid arguments by form, detecting ambiguity is essential to\nlogical representation of natural language arguments. Frege noted this\nto be the main defect of natural language and a real obstacle to\ntrying to formalize it (as opposed to just using the formal language\nwithout translation from natural language). We typically are more\noptimistic on this point than Frege; but the long history of dispute\nover such issues as the pragmatic-semantics distinction and skepticism\nover the viability of semantic theory in general stand as\nchallenges.\n5.2 Basic Semantic Methodology\n\nAmbiguity has been used methodologically as a way to shield a theory\nfrom counter-example. Kripke laments this tendency explicitly:\n\n\nIt is very much the lazy man\u2019s approach in philosophy to posit\nambiguities when in trouble. If we face a putative counterexample to\nour favorite philosophical thesis, it is always open to us to protest\nthat some key term is being used in a special sense, different from\nits use in the thesis. We may be right, but the ease of the move\nshould counsel a policy of caution: Do not posit an ambiguity unless\nyou are really forced to, unless there are really compelling\ntheoretical or intuitive grounds to suppose that an ambiguity really\nis present.(Kripke 1977, p.268)\n\n\nGrice (1975) counsels a methodological principle: \u2018Senses are\nnot to be multiplied beyond necessity\u2019.\n\nThis general moral seems right. It is worryingly easy to deflect a\ncounter-example or to explain an intuition by claiming differences in\nmeaning. On the other hand, in philosophical discourse, distinctions\nthat are quite fine can be made that may well be missed by normal\nusers of the language who are inclined to miss\ndifferences in meaning that are slight. One thus often will be tempted\nto posit ambiguity as a way to reconcile differences between two\nplausible hypotheses about the meanings of words and phrases\n(\u2018evidence\u2019 has both an internal sense and an external\nsense, \u2018right action\u2019 has both a utilitarian sense and a\ndeontic sense\u2026) A neat case of this is Gilbert Ryle\u2019s\ncontention that \u2018exists\u2019 is ambiguous mentioned above:\n\n\n\u2026two different senses of \u2018exist\u2019, somewhat as\n\u2018rising\u2019 has different senses in \u2018the tide is\nrising\u2019, \u2018hopes are rising\u2019, and \u2018the average\nage of death is rising\u2019. A man would be thought to be making a\npoor joke who said that three things are now rising, namely the tide,\nhopes and the average age of death. It would be just as good or bad a\njoke to say that there exist prime numbers and Wednesdays and public\nopinions and navies; or that there exist both minds and bodies. (Ryle\n1949, p. 23)\n\n\nRyle here makes use of the conjunction reduction test mentioned above\nand has been the target of much scorn for his intuitions on this\nmatter. This may just go to show how hard it is to (dis)prove a claim\nto ambiguity using the tests.\n5.3 The Analytic-Synthetic Distinction\n\nOne long-standing issue about ambiguity is that it assumes a\ndifference between something like sense and reference. While some\nwords can clearly be used to refer to things that are wildly different\nin ontic category, that has not been taken to be sufficient for a\nclaim to ambiguity. In theory, a phrase could be ambiguous and yet\ndiffer not at all in reference: imagine a term t that was\nambiguous between two meanings, but it turned out as highly surprising\nessential condition that things that were t in the first\nsense were also t in the second sense \u2013 while this seems\nunlikely to happen, it is by no means conceptually impossible.\n\nHowever, the 20th century saw a vicious and sometimes relentless\nattack on the distinction between facts about meaning and facts about\nreference (see the entry on the \n  analytic/synthetic distinction). \n  If the line between these two is blurry, there will very\nlikely be cases in which the line between ambiguity and\nsense-generality is blurry as well (and not just epistemologically).\nLet\u2019s indulge in some possible-world anthropology on a group\nthat uses a term, \u2018gavagai\u2019 (Quine 1960). Furthermore, I\nstipulate (perhaps counter-possibly) that the world is a\nfour-dimensional world with respect to the referent of\n\u2018gavagai\u2019 so if they refer at all with\n\u2018gavagai\u2019, they refer to something made up of stages. Now\nwe sit down to write the lexicon of the world\u2019s inhabitants and\nwe come to \u2018gavagai\u2019. We write:\n\n\n\u2018Gavagai\u2019 (ga-vuh-guy): (N, sing.):\n\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to know what to write down for this entry as\nit\u2019s not obvious what counts as semantic content for the word\nand what counts as information about the referent of the word. For\nexample, say they clearly think that the referent of\n\u2018gavagai\u2019 is something that does not have temporal parts.\nDoes this mean that they fail to refer to rabbits with\n\u2018gavagai\u2019 or that they are mistaken about their nature? If\nthis question is hard to answer, we can generalize to harder cases:\nsay that some of the \u2018rabbits\u2019 in this world are\nthree-dimensional and some four- dimensional. Should we countenance an\nambiguity in \u2018gavagai\u2019 given that the people use it\nindiscriminately to refer to both? Should we posit a lexical ambiguity\nwith two different definitions for \u2018gavagai\u2019?\n\nThis case may be far-fetched; but we have a real live cases of it.\nField (1973) discusses the case of the term \u2018mass\u2019, which seems to have been\nthought to pick out one property of objects but in fact picks out two\nthat are really very different in character. Deciding whether this is\na surprising case of disjunctive reference, or an indeterminacy in\nreference is no easy task, but the decision has ramifications for\nwhether or not we categorize \u2018mass\u2019 as ambiguous or highly\nsense-general (and if sense-general, what is the general sense?)\n5.4 The Flexibility of the Lexicon\n\nThe lexicon is highly productive and easily extended. Most people,\nincluding myself, upon hearing:\n\nShe bought a rabbit.\n\n\nwill think that it\u2019s safe to infer that she bought a\nfuzzy little pet that hops around and likes carrots. However, upon\nlearning that there is a car by the same name made by Volkswagen, it\nwill be much less clear to me that I know what she bought.\n\nSimilar phenomena include dead metaphors and idioms. The former\ninclude such items as \u2018branch\u2019 which now applies to\ndistinct sections of the government, the latter to phrases \u2018kick\nthe bucket.\u2019 (As an aside, I puzzled over several candidates for\nboth and realized it was hard to tell in most cases which were which!)\nThese clearly pass the ambiguity tests above by exhibiting zeugma,\ni.e.,\n\n?The government and the trees have branches.\n?He kicked the bucket last week and she did too, twice.\n\n\nIt\u2019s controversial whether metaphors ever actually die and\nwhether or not, assuming they do die, they are metaphors. So it is\ncontroversial whether or not \u2018branch\u2019 is lexically\nambiguous. It clearly has two readings but whether or not these are to\nbe reflected as lexical meanings is a difficult and vague\nmatter \u2013 not that it clearly matters all that much in most\ncases.\n5.5 Legal Interpretations\n\nOn the other hand, the facts about ambiguity can matter a great deal\nwhen it comes to determining policy, extension of law etc. The law is\nsensitive to this and makes certain division between ambiguities. For\nexample, the law divides between patent and latent ambiguity, where\nthe former roughly corresponds to a case where the meaning of a law is\nunclear, the latter to cases where the meaning is clear but applies\nequally well to highly disparate things. In effect, this is the\ndifference between ambiguity in sense and ambiguity in reference.\n\nU.S. Constitution scholars sometimes claim that the Constitution is\n\u2018ambiguous\u2019 at key points. A famous example of such an ambiguity is the\nsuccession of the vice president, where the framers stipulate\nthat:\n\n\nIn Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death,\nResignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the\nsaid Office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, (Article 2,\nsection 1)\n\n\nThe clause is not clear as to what \u2018devolve\u2019 means.\n\nOf course, given what has been discussed, this looks to be more like a\ncase of under-specificity, or simply ignorance of a word\u2019s\nmeaning (in 1787), not ambiguity. As the distinction has no real legal\nrelevance in this case, it is ignored as it generally is in common\nparlance.\n6. Ambiguity and Indexicality: Are They Easily Told Apart?\n\nIn\n section 2\n we looked at phenomena that were not the same as ambiguity; in this\nsection, we look at a few cases in which we might have been wrong to\ntear them apart.\n6.1 Deictic vs. Bound Anaphora\n\nIt is often claimed that:\n\nJohn loves his mother.\n\n\nis ambiguous between a deictic reading and a bound reading. Syntactic\northodoxy holds that either \u2018his\u2019 is co-indexed with John\nor it bears a different referential index. Various theories of\nanaphora, however, have claimed that we can dispense with the\nfundamental ambiguity between free and bound anaphora and unify the\ntreatment of the two. Dynamic Semantics aspires to offer just such a\nunified account, taking all anaphora to always refer to discourse\nreferents, or functions from information states to information states.\nThis provides a unified treatment of the function of anaphora in\nnatural language and dispenses with the need to think of anaphoric\ninterpretation as ambiguous as opposed to merely context-sensitive.\n(See Heim 1982, 1983, and Kamp 1981).\n6.2 The Scope of Indefinites\n\nConsider:\n\nEvery man who read a book by Chomsky is happy.\n\n\n(77) is ambiguous between one where \u2018a book by Chomsky\u2019\ntakes wide scope over \u2018every man who reads\u2019 and one where\nit takes narrow scope. Maybe so; but most quantifiers in fact cannot\nescape from relative clauses. Relative clauses are known as\n\u2018scope islands\u2019, or contexts in which quantifiers\ncan\u2019t be interpreted as raised. In fact, it has been noted that\nindefinites seem to escape from nearly any normal scope island\nwhatsoever. This suggests that treating the various readings as an\nambiguity akin to other scopal ambiguities is mistaken. Another\ntreatment of (77)\u2019s multiplicity of readings involves domain\nrestriction: if we restrict the domain of \u2018a book\u2019 to only\none particular book, we can emulate the reading one would get from\ntreating \u2018a book\u2019 as having wide-scope. Domain restriction\ntraditionally is treated as a matter of context sensitivity rather\nthan ambiguity. We thus have some reason to doubt that the right\ntreatment of (77) has much to do with the phenomenon of scope. (see\nSchwarzchild (2002) for further discussion).\n6.3 Modals\n\nAs noted above, modals seem to come in various flavours (doxastic,\nmetaphysical, logical, deontic, practical\u2026). It is tempting to\ntreat these as ambiguities involving the modal term. However, it is\nworth noting that other treatments abound. Kratzer (1983) treats\nmodals as univocal but indexical: they get their differing\ninterpretations by taking in different input sets of worlds and\norderings induced on the relevant sets. If this is right, it may well\nbe that what looks like an ambiguity should actually be treated as a\nmatter of straightforward indexicality (much like \u2018I\u2019 is\nnot ambiguous but indexical).\n6.4 Focal Stress\nA really interesting case that may be loosely described as\nambiguity at the level of a sentence concerns focal stress and its\nmyriad of interesting effects. Generally focal stress is well known to\nco-ordinate assertions with questions under discuss and to introduce\nsets of alternatives into a discourse. In particular, these\nalternative sets can have truth conditional effects, for example:\n\nPutin only poisons his opponents.\nPutin only poisons his opponents\n (78) is falsified by Putin shooting an opponent, (79) is not.\n(78) introduces a presupposition that Putin does something to his\nopponents while (79) introduces a presupposition that Putin poisons\nsomeone. The sentence, thought of in terms of orthography, \u2018Putin only\npoisons his opponents\u2019 is thus ambiguous. Assuming that focal stress\nis syntactically marked, the LF disambiguates. See (Rooth (1993) and\nHerburger (2000) for semantic theories of focal stress).\n\n6.5 Cancellation vs. Disambiguation\n\nGriceans have long used cancellation as a method to detect\nconversational implicatures, or information communicated by an utterer\nof a sentence that isn\u2019t part of what\u2019s said by S. Cancellation is a\nprocedure by which an explicit denial of putatively conveyed\ninformation is conjoined to the original utterance to see if the\nresult is a contradiction. For example, consider an utterance of:\n\nI got drunk and I drove home (but not in that order).\n\n\n\nThe non-bracketed sentence, absent an utterance of the bracketed\ncontent, will typically convey the order events as being mirrored in\nthe order of the conjuncts. But, as Grice famously argued, this\nisn\u2019t due to an embedded ordering in the meaning of\n\u2018and\u2019 as shown by the addition of the bracketed content\nnot producing a contradiction. The Gricean stories about how we come\nabout this extra information in non-cancellation cases is fairly well\nknown. But given the preceding, it\u2019s not hard to see that an\noption has been overlooked: why shouldn\u2019t we think of\n\u2018but\u2019 as playing the role of a disambiguator? If\n\u2018and\u2019 were ambiguous, for example, wouldn\u2019t one way\nof avoiding an contradictory utterance involve adding a phrase that\nruled out one possible meaning? We saw Grice\u2019s claims about\nModified Occam\u2019s razor and so perhaps attributing an ambiguity\nto \u2018and\u2019 is not so attractive.  But perhaps an ambiguity\nin the assignment of times to the present tense markers is, and the\nputative cancellation serves to indicate the intended resolution of the\nthose variables? Or perhaps \u2018and\u2019 signals two or more\npossible discourse relations and the putative cancellation services to\ndisambiguate between those? Lepore and Stone (2016) put disambiguation\nto work in an attempt to show that ambiguities in interpretation are\nmore rife and wide spread than we might have previously assumed. If\nthey are right, ambiguity plays a more central role than perhaps might\nhave been thought in sentence, utterance and discourse\ninterpretation. It remains to see if they are. The point of these\nexamples is that it is often difficult to tell which theoretical\ntreatment best explains a case of multiple interpretability. One must\nbe cautious in one\u2019s approach to these issues. It is all too\neasy to notice an apparent ambiguity, but often all too difficult to\nexplain its nature.\n",
