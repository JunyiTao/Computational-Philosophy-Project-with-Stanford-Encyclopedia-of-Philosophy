    "main_text": "Intentionalist Approaches || Psychological Partitioning\n2.2 Psychological Partitioning\n\nAnother strategy employed by intentionalists is the division of the\nself into psychological parts that play the role of the deceiver and\ndeceived, respectively. These strategies range from positing strong\ndivision in the self, where the deceiving part is a relatively\nautonomous subagency capable of belief, desire, and intention (Rorty\n1988), to more moderate division, where the deceiving part still\nconstitutes a separate center of agency (Pears 1984, 1986; 1991), to\nthe relatively modest division of Davidson (1982, 1986), where there\nneed only be a boundary between conflicting attitudes and\nintentions.\n\nSuch divisions are prompted in large part by the acceptance of the\ndual-belief requirement. It isn\u2019t simply that self-deceivers\nhold contradictory beliefs, which though strange, isn\u2019t\nimpossible since one can believe that p and believe that\n~p without believing that p & ~p. The\nproblem such theorists face stems from the appearance that the belief\nthat ~p motivates and thus forms a part of the intention to\nbring it about that one acquires and maintains the false belief that\np (Davidson 1986). So, for example, the Nazi official\u2019s\nrecognition that his actions implicate him in serious evil motivates\nhim to implement a strategy to deceive himself into believing he is\nnot so involved; he can\u2019t intend to bring it about that he holds\nsuch a false belief if he doesn\u2019t recognize it is false, and he\nwouldn\u2019t want to bring such a belief about if he didn\u2019t\nrecognize the evidence to the contrary. So long as this is the case,\nthe deceiving self, whether it constitutes a separate center of agency\nor something less robust, must be hidden from the conscious self being\ndeceived if the self-deceptive intention is to succeed.\n\nWhile these psychological partitioning approaches seem to resolve the\nstatic and dynamic puzzles, they do so by introducing a picture of the\nmind that raises puzzles of its own. On this point, there appears to\nbe consensus even among intentionalists that self-deception can and\nshould be accounted for without invoking speculative or stipulative\ndivisions not already used to explain non-self-deceptive behavior,\nwhat Talbott (1995) calls \u2018innocent\u2019 divisions. That said,\nrecent, if controversial, research (e.g., Bargh and Morsella 2008;\nHassin, Bargh, and Zimmerman 2009; Huang and Bargh 2014) seems to\nsupport the possibility of the sort of robust unconscious but flexible\ngoal pursuit that could explain the way self-deceivers are able to\npursue their deceptive goal while retaining the beliefs necessary for\nnavigating the shifting evidential terrain (see Funkhouser and Barrett\n2016, 2017 and Doody 2016 for skepticism about the applicability of\nthis research to self-deception). If this kind of research shows that\nno \u2018psychological exotica\u2019 are necessary to explain\nself-deception, there is less pressure to deflate the phenomenon in\nways that minimize the active, strategic role self-deceivers play in\nthe process.\n",
