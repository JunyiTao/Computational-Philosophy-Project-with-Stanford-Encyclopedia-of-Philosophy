But this\ntheoretical virtue comes at the cost of a possibilist objection: their\nviews allow agents to avoid incurring moral obligations simply in\nvirtue of having an imperfect moral character, and this allows agents\nto, morally speaking, get off the hook too easily (Jackson &\nPargetter 1986: 240; Zimmerman 1996: 193\u2013194, 2006: 156;\nPortmore 2011: 207; Baker 2012: 642\u201343; Timmerman 2015;\nTimmerman & Cohen 2016; Cohen & Timmerman 2016). For example,\n\nProcrastinate avoids incurring an obligation to comment on a\nstudent\u2019s paper simply because she is disposed to behave badly.\nActualism is committed to this even in cases in which an agent is\ndisposed to behave badly just because they intend to behave badly.\nBut, possibilists claim, agents cannot avoid incurring an obligation to \\(\\phi\\)\nsimply because they intend to \\(\\phi\\) poorly. More generally,\npossibilists claim that being disposed to do wrong does not allow one\nto avoid incurring obligations to do good.\n\nProponents of\n (G*1)\n or\n (S)\n may retort by reminding us that this apparently problematic\nimplication is the result of taking into account the relevant\ncounterfactuals, and that not taking them into account is too costly.\nWhile Procrastinate\u2019s \u27e8agreeing to review the\npaper\u27e9 is part of the best act-set that she can perform over\ntime, it is also part of the worst act-set that she can perform over\ntime, and the worst act-set would be performed if Procrastinate were\nto \u27e8agree to review the paper\u27e9 (Jackson & Pargetter\n1986: 237). Similarly, Jones\u2019 \u27e8going to the\noffice\u27e9 is part of the best act-set that she can perform over\ntime, but it is also part of the worst act-set that she can perform\nover time, and the worst act-set would be performed if Jones were to\n\u27e8go to the office\u27e9.\n\nContextualist actualism can, in a sense, sidestep this possibilist\nobjection since contextual actualists agree with possibilists that an\nagent ought to do the best that she can over time, and, in addition,\nthey consider this obligation to override all other obligations in the\naforementioned sense (Jackson 1985: 194; Jackson & Pargetter 1986:\n242\u2013243; Jackson 2014: 636). Possibilists may not be satisfied\nwith this response. Since possibilists accept ODC, they infer that\nProcrastinate is obligated to \u27e8agree to review the\npaper\u27e9 from the fact that Procrastinate is obligated to\n\u27e8agree to review the paper & then write the review\u27e9.\nContextualist actualism denies that Procrastinate is obligated to\n\u27e8agree to review the paper\u27e9 at the cost of rejecting\nODC.\n3.5.2 Sanctioning bad behavior\n\nAll of these versions of actualism face a second possibilist\nobjection: they prescribe bad behavior that the agent can easily avoid\n(Wedgwood 2009\n [OIR];\n Ross 2012: 75\u201376). For example, Procrastinate can easily avoid\n\u27e8declining to review the paper\u27e9 by \u27e8agreeing to\nreview the paper\u27e9 and, once Procrastinate \u27e8agrees to\nreview the paper\u27e9, she can easily \u27e8write the\nreview\u27e9. Nevertheless, all of these versions of actualism\nmaintain that Procrastinate should \u27e8decline to review the\npaper\u27e9 rather than \u27e8agree to review the paper\u27e9.\nOther extreme actualist-possibilist scenarios highlight the force of\nthis objection. Suppose that the following act-set is the best one\navailable to a mass murderer M at \\(t_1\\): \u27e8kill no\n\none\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\) and \u27e8kill no one\u27e9 at \\(t_2\\).\n\nSuppose, however, that the best immediately available option for\nM is \u27e8killing someone at \\(t_1\\)\u27e9 because of the\ntruth of the following two counterfactuals: \u201cif M were to\n\u27e8kill someone\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\), then M would\n\u27e8kill no one\u27e9 at \\(t_2\\)\u201d, \u201cif M were\nto \u27e8kill no one\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\), then M would\n\u27e8kill ten people\u27e9 at \\(t_2\\)\u201d. Possibilists claim\nthat M should \u27e8kill no one\u27e9 from\n\\(t_1\\)\u2013\\(t_2\\) and thus that M should \u27e8kill no\none\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\). Actualists, however, claim that M\nshould \u27e8kill someone\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\). Contextualist\nactualism at least allows one to say that although \u27e8killing\nsomeone\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\) is obligatory, doing this violates\nM\u2019s obligation to \u27e8kill no one\u27e9 from\n\\(t_1\\)\u2013\\(t_2\\). Goldman and Sobel\u2019s versions cannot\naccommodate this appeasing judgment.\n\nIt is worth noting that possibilism is thought to be subject to a\nrelated problem. While it doesn\u2019t allow agents to avoid incurring\nmoral obligations for having a vicious moral character, it does allow\nagents to avoid incurring moral obligations to curtail their vicious\nmoral character (Timmerman and Swenson 2019). To illustrate the\nproblem, suppose that one of the optimific act-sets Apathetic Andy can\nperform over time includes \u27e8playing video games tonight and\ndonating his expendable income to charity tomorrow\u27e9. Andy is,\nhowever, quite apathetic. As such, he won\u2019t \u27e8donate his\nexpendable income to charity tomorrow\u27e9 unless he first\n\u27e8reads work by Peter Singer tonight\u27e9. If he\n\u27e8plays video games tonight\u27e9, he will merely reinforce\nhis selfish nature and \u27e8use his expendable income to purchase\nmore video games tomorrow\u27e9. Here\u2019s the catch. The other\noptimific act-set Apathetic Andy can perform is to \u27e8read work\nby Peter Singer tonight and donate his expendable income to charity\ntomorrow\u27e9. Moreover, if Andy \u27e8reads work by Peter Singer\ntonight\u27e9, he would \u27e8donate his expendable income to\ncharity tomorrow\u27e9. Performing this optimific act-set won\u2019t be\npleasant for Andy, though, since he finds reading philosophy to be\ntedious. Here\u2019s the problem. Possibilism renders the verdict that Andy\nis permitted to \u27e8play video games tonight\u27e9, which would\nnot only result in a suboptimal outcome, but also exacerbate (rather\nthan curtail) his bad moral character. By contrast, actualism entails\nthat Andy is obligated to improve his moral character by\n\u27e8reading work by Peter Singer tonight\u27e9, and actualism\nthus ensures that Andy would \u27e8donate his expendable income to\ncharity tomorrow\u27e9. So, both possibilism and actualism seem to\nlet agents with vicious moral characters off the hook too easily,\nalbeit in different circumstances and in different ways.\n\nIn the next section we will consider an additional objection to\nactualism that has led to the development of views that may be\nconsidered intermediaries of actualism and possibilism. According to\nthese views, a counterfactual is relevant to an agent\u2019s present\nobligation only if the agent presently lacks a specific kind of\ncontrol over the truth-value of that counterfactual.\n4. Securitist Views\n\nRecall that the kinds of actualist-possibilist scenarios that we have\nbeen discussing\u2014the cases of Professor Procrastinate\nand the case of Jones\u2014are diachronic cases in the sense\nthat they concern different acts that are performed across different\nmoments of time, rather than at the same time. For example, in the\ncase of Professor Procrastinate, one of the relevant\ncounterfactuals is that if she were to \u27e8agree to review the\npaper\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\), then she would \u27e8not write the\nreview\u27e9 at \\(t_2\\). The act in the antecedent and the act in\nthe consequent are indexed to different times. On the surface, it may\nappear that a diachronic case would yield the same results as a\nsynchronic case, i.e., a case that involves the performance of\ndifferent acts at the same time. But as Goldman (1978) shows, a\nsynchronic actualist-possibilist scenario yields new difficulties for\nactualism, including Goldman\u2019s (1976)\n (G*1),\n and the way to address these difficulties is by incorporating a\ncontrol condition over the truth-value of certain counterfactuals.\n4.1 A Synchronic Actualist-Possibilist Case\n\nConsider Goldman\u2019s (1978: 186) case, which we\u2019ll call\nTraffic 1:\n\n Traffic 1: Jones is driving\nthrough a tunnel behind a slow-moving truck. It is illegal to change\nlanes in the tunnel, and Jones\u2019 doing so would disrupt traffic.\nNevertheless she is going to change lanes [at t]\u2014perhaps\nshe doesn\u2019t realize it is illegal, or perhaps she is simply in a\nhurry. If she changes lanes without accelerating [at t],\ntraffic will be disrupted more severely than if she accelerates. If\nshe accelerates without changing lanes [at t], her car will\ncollide with the back of a truck.\n\n\nAccording to Goldman, it seems that Jones should\n\u27e8accelerate\u27e9 at t since Jones is going to\n\u27e8change lanes\u27e9 at t, and \u27e8accelerating\n& changing lanes\u27e9 at t would result in a better\noutcome than that of \u27e8not accelerating & changing\nlanes\u27e9. But now consider this case:\n\n Traffic 2: Everything that is true in\nTraffic 1 is true in this case. Additionally, Jones would\n\u27e8not accelerate\u27e9 at t if Jones were to either\n\u27e8change lanes\u27e9 or \u27e8not change lanes\u27e9 at\nt.\n\n\nIn Traffic 2 Jones \u27e8changes lanes and doesn\u2019t\naccelerate\u27e9 at t. It seems that Jones should \u27e8not\nchange lanes\u27e9 at t since she is going to \u27e8not\naccelerate\u27e9 at t. But it also seems that Jones should\n\u27e8accelerate\u27e9 at t since she is going to\n\u27e8change lanes\u27e9. We have arrived at the verdict that in\nTraffic 2 Jones should \u27e8not change lanes\u27e9 and\nthat Jones should \u27e8accelerate\u27e9. This verdict is\nextremely counterintuitive since this would result in colliding with\nthe back of the truck, which is the worst possible outcome. \n\nAccording to Goldman, the lesson to be gleamed from synchronic\nactualist-possibilist cases is this: In determining what we are\nobligated at t to do at t, we should not hold fixed\nfacts about what we are freely doing at t. Moreover, such synchronic\ncounterfactuals do not determine in any way what an agent is obligated\nto do at any time. Consequently, the kind of immediate act-set that is\na candidate for being obligatory is the fully specific simultaneous\nact-set that is immediately available to Jones. A performable fully\nspecific simultaneous act-set is one such that one cannot also perform\nany other act-set at the relevant time. Goldman (1978: 190) calls such\nact-sets maximal conjunctive acts, but this entry will stick with the\nterminology of a fully specific simultaneous act-set in order\nto avoid ambiguation with other notions of act-sets at issue in this\npaper. Let\u2019s suppose that the (immediate) fully specific\nsimultaneous act-sets available to Jones are ranked from best to worst\nas follows. \n\n \u27e8Don\u2019t change lanes & don\u2019t\naccelerate\u27e9\n \u27e8Change lanes & accelerate\u27e9\n \u27e8Change lanes & don\u2019t accelerate\u27e9\n \u27e8Don\u2019t change lanes & accelerate\u27e9\n\n\nAccording to Goldman, given options (1)\u2013(4), Jones should\nobviously perform (1). Moreover, notice that if Jones were to\nperform (1), then the following synchronic counterfactual that is in\nfact true in Traffic 2 would be false instead: \u201cif\nJones were to \u27e8not accelerate\u27e9 at t, then at\nt Jones would \u27e8change lanes\u27e9\u201d. So, given\nthe intuition that Jones is obligated to perform (1) and that doing so\nwould alter the truth-value of certain synchronic counterfactuals, we\nshould not hold fixed the truth-value of such synchronic\ncounterfactuals when theorizing about an agent\u2019s obligation to\nperform some immediate fully specific simultaneous act-set. To\naccommodate this judgment, Goldman\u2019s (1978) revised view\nincorporates a control condition over the truth-value of such\nsynchronic counterfactuals.\n4.2 Fully Specified Immediate Options\n\nGoldman\u2019s revised view still adopts the insight behind\n (G*1)\n that, in order to avoid the possibility of jointly unfulfillable\nobligations, an obligatory act-set (or, as Goldman calls it, a sequence\nof acts) must be such that it would occur if the agent were to\nimmediately perform the first act of the act-set, and the agent can\nperform this first act of the act-set. Goldman\u2019s revised view\n(1978: 202) is referred to as \u201c4\u201d, but we will refer to\nit as (G+) here:\n\n\n(G+)\nS ought at\n\\(t_1\\) to perform maximal sequence X starting at \\(t_1\\) if\nand only if S has the ability at \\(t_1\\) to perform X,\nand X is better than any alternative maximal sequence starting\nfrom \\(t_1\\) which S also has the ability at \\(t_1\\) to\n  perform.\n\n\n\n\nUnlike\n (G*1) ,\n Goldman\u2019s revised view requires the first act to be a fully\nspecific simultaneous act-set. Moreover, the kind of act-set that\nshould be directly assessed is a maximal sequence. S\nhas the ability at \\(t_1\\) to perform X only if S has\nthe ability at \\(t_1\\) to immediately (at \\(t_1)\\) perform the first\nfully specific simultaneous act-set in \\(X.\\) Goldman\u2019s (1978:\n201) notion of a maximal sequence is different from the\npossibilist\u2019s aforementioned notion of a maximal act-set which\nextends to the end of one\u2019s life. For, according to Goldman\n(1978: 193\u2013195), at t an agent can perform an act-set\nover time if and only if, if at t the agent wanted to perform\nthis act-set, then the agent would do so over time. This implies that\nthe performable act-set over time must be such that the agent can, at\nt, form an intention to perform this act-set over time that\nwould be causally efficacious if the intention were formed.\nGoldman\u2019s notion of a maximal sequence is thus more restricted.\nThat is, a maximal sequence X is an act-set available to an\nagent at t is such that, at t, the agent can form an\nintention to perform X, and no other act-set that at t\nthe agent can intend to perform is a proper part of X. So,\nhenceforth, we will refer to Goldman\u2019s notion of a maximal\nsequence as an intentionally maximal act-set, and this is to\nbe distinguished from a maximal act-set.\n\nRecall that, according to Ability 2, an agent S has\nthe ability to immediately perform the first fully specific act-set in\nan intentionally maximal act-set if and only if S would perform\nthis fully specific act-set if S wanted to do so, and by\nextension we may assume Jones can perform each of (1)\u2013(4). Under\nthis assumption,\n (G+)\n implies that although Jones would \u27e8change lanes\u27e9 if she\nwere to \u27e8not accelerate\u27e9, Jones nevertheless ought to do\nsomething that requires her to \u27e8not accelerate\u27e9, viz.\n\u27e8not change lanes & not accelerate\u27e9. To see how (G+)\ndiffers from the versions of actualism in\n section 3,\n consider the following version of Professor\nProcrastinate:\n\n Professor Procrastinate*: If\nProcrastinate were to \u27e8accept the request\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\),\nthen Procrastinate would do so by deciding at \\(t_1\\) to harm the\nstudent by falsely promising to review at \\(t_2\\). So if Procrastinate\nwere to \u27e8accept the request\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\), then she would\n\u27e8not comment\u27e9 at \\(t_2\\). However, Procrastinate can\n\u27e8accept and comment\u27e9 by deciding at \\(t_1\\) to do so.\nMoreover, if Procrastinate were to do this, then it would be true that\nif Procrastinate were to \u27e8accept the request\u27e9 at\n\\(t_1\\), then she would \u27e8comment\u27e9 at \\(t_2\\) (cf.\nPortmore 2011: 204).\n\n\nAccording to\n (G+)\n Procrastinate is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to perform an intentionally\nmaximal act-set M that includes \u27e8accepting the request\nand commenting\u27e9 because there is an immediate fully specific\nact-set available to Procrastinate at \\(t_1\\) such that if it were\nperformed then M would occur, and M is the best\nintentionally maximal act-set that is securable for Procrastinate at\n\\(t_1\\). By contrast, according to\n (G*1)\n Procrastinate is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to \u27e8not accept the\nrequest\u27e9 because this would result in the performance of\nact-set M* that includes \u27e8not commenting\u27e9 at\n\\(t_2\\), and M* is better than the act-set M** that\nwould occur if Procrastinate were to \u27e8accept the\nrequest\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\) because M** includes\n\u27e8accepting & not commenting\u27e9.\n\nOne might suspect that a modified version of\n (G*1)\n that focuses exclusively upon decisions rather than overt bodily acts\ncan handle synchronic actualist-possibilist cases, such as\nProfessor Procrastinate*. But this isn\u2019t so because it\nis possible for the following two counterfactuals to be true:\n\n If Procrastinate were to \u27e8decide to accept the\nrequest\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\), then she would \u27e8decide to both\naccept the request & not comment\u27e9.\n If Procrastinate were to \u27e8decide to both accept the\nrequest & comment\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\), then she would\n\u27e8accept the request & comment\u27e9.\n\n\nEven though (i) is true, the best thing that Procrastinate can do\ninvolves \u27e8deciding to accept the request\u27e9, viz.\n\u27e8deciding to accept the request & commenting\u27e9 at\n\\(t_1\\). This shows that whether we assess an agent\u2019s\nobligations in terms of decisions or overt bodily acts, the acts that\nare to be directly assessed are fully specific simultaneous act-sets,\nwhich is precisely what\n (G+)\n accomplishes.\n\nContextualist actualism and Goldman\u2019s provisional but rejected\nprinciple\n (G)\n similarly imply that Jones is obligated at \\(t_1\\) to perform (1)\nrather than any of (2)\u2013(4) since these views permit a\ncandidate obligatory act to be fully specific. But these views do not\nrequire a candidate obligatory act to be fully specific, and\nthus these views also have the peculiar implication that in\nTraffic II Jones is obligated to \u27e8accelerate\u27e9\nand Jones is obligated to \u27e8not change lanes\u27e9.\n4.3 Kinds of Control Over Immediate Options\n\nThus far, we have seen that synchronic actualist-possibilist cases\nsuggest that, first and foremost, an agent has an obligation to\nperform a fully specific immediate act rather than a\nless-than-fully-specific immediate act. As a result, synchronic\ncounterfactuals do not even partly determine an agent\u2019s\nobligation to perform some fully specific immediate act. This still\nleaves open a question about the ability that an agent must possess in\norder to be able to perform some immediate (fully specific) act in the\nrelevant sense. Goldman\u2019s (1978: 195, 204\u2013205) Ability\n2, for instance, is a version of the conditional analysis of\nabilities. The conditional analysis of abilities remains suspect by\nsome on the grounds that an agent does not have direct control over\ntheir desires. Given this, one may infer that facts about what an\nagent would do if she had different desires is irrelevant to her\nabilities (Lehrer 1968; Curran 1995: 82). Nevertheless, since many\nparticipants in the actualist-possibilist debate take for granted that\nthe ability to do otherwise is compatible with facts about what an\nagent will do or would do under certain circumstances, a number of\npeople have followed Goldman (1978) by taking the relevant kind of\ncontrol to be one that does not hold fixed all facts about the\nagent\u2019s psychological makeup. See, for instance, the views of\nDoug Portmore (2011) and Jacob Ross (2012).\n\nPortmore (2011) understands the relevant kind of control an agent must\nhave over an option in terms of scrupulous securability. A\nset of acts (i.e., an act-set) is scrupulously securable by an agent\nonly if there is some set of intentions and some set of permissible\nbackground attitudes (including beliefs and desires), such that if the\nagent had these intentions and attitudes, then the agent would perform\nthat act-set (2011: 165). The sorts of attitudes Portmore (2011: 167)\nhas in mind are judgment-sensitive attitudes, i.e., attitudes that are\nsensitive to judgments about reasons (Scanlon 1998: 20). \n\nThis form of control is similar to the conditional analysis insofar as\nthe agent does not need to possess the relevant intentions and\nattitudes required to perform an act in order to have an ability to\nperform that act. It just has to be the case that if the agent were to\nhave such intentions and attitudes, then the agent would perform the\nrelevant act. Portmore\u2019s (2011: 166\u2013167) exact account of\ncontrol is as follows:\n\n\nA set of acts, \\(\u03b1_j\\), is, as of \\(t_i\\), scrupulously\nsecurable by S if and only if there is a time, \\(t_j\\), that\neither immediately follows \\(t_i\\) or is identical to \\(t_i\\), a set\nof acts, \\(\u03b1_i\\), (where \\(\u03b1_i\\) may, or may not, be\nidentical to \\(\u03b1_j\\)), and a set of background attitudes,\nB, such that the following are all true: (1) S would\nperform \\(\u03b1_j\\) if S were to have at \\(t_i\\) both\nB and the intention to perform \\(\u03b1_i\\); (2) S has\nat \\(t_i\\) the capacity to continue, or to come, to have at \\(t_j\\)\nboth B and the intention to perform \\(\u03b1_i\\); and (3)\nS would continue, or come, to have at \\(t_j\\) B (and,\nwhere \\(\u03b1_i\\) is not identical to \\(\u03b1_j\\), the intention\nto perform \\(\u03b1_i\\) as well) if S both were at \\(t_i\\)\naware of all the relevant reason-constituting facts and were at\n\\(t_j\\) to respond to these facts/reasons in all and only the ways\nthat they prescribe, thereby coming to have at \\(t_j\\) all those\nattitudes that, given those facts, she has decisive reason to have and\nonly those attitudes that she has, given those facts, sufficient\nreason to have.\n\n\nPortmore (2011: 177) understands a set of acts \\(\u03b1_j\\) to be a\nmaximal act-set in a similar vein to both a possibilist\u2019s notion\nof a maximal act-set and Sobel\u2019s notion of a life. The set of\nacts \u201c\\(\u03b1_i\\)\u201d is not identical to\n\u201c\\(\u03b1_j\\)\u201d when, e.g., one lacks the ability at\n\\(t_j\\) to form an intention to perform \u201c\\(\u03b1_j\\)\u201d,\nalthough the agent would in fact perform \\(\u03b1_j\\) if the agent\nwere to form at \\(t_j\\) the intention to perform \\(\u03b1_i\\). For\nexample, earning a PhD may be presently scrupulously securable for an\nagent, although she is presently unable to form an intention to do all\nof the things that are required to attain a PhD at least because she\ncannot presently intend to write about an idea in her dissertation\nthat she has not yet studied (Portmore 2011: 169). So, whenever\n\\(\u03b1_j\\) and \\(\u03b1_i\\) are not identical, part (1) says that\nS would perform some act-set if S were to intend to\nperform some other act-set (along with certain background\nattitudes).\n\nPart (2) of the above definition states that an agent must have a\ncapacity (or an ability) to have certain attitudes and intentions.\nThis allows one to sidestep the difficulties that have been posed for\nthe conditional analysis of abilities (cf. Portmore 2011: 168). Part\n(3) states that the agent\u2019s attitudes must be permissible. To\nillustrate, suppose that the only way in which Doug can ensure at 2 pm\nthat he will eat a healthy meal rather than pizza at 6 pm is by having\nthe irrational belief that his life depends upon eating a healthy meal\nat 6 pm. Since it seems that he is not obligated to have such a\nbelief, it follows that, at 2 pm, Doug is not obligated to eat a\nhealthy meal at 6 pm since there is no combination of intentions and\npermissible attitudes (as opposed to impermissible attitudes) that\nDoug can have at 2 pm, such that if he were to have them at 2 pm then\nhe would eat a healthy meal at 6 pm (Portmore 2011:\n164\u2013165).\n\nPortmore (2011: 222) pairs this notion of control with the following\naccount of rational permissibility that applies to moral\npermissibility when there are moral reasons to act:\n\n Securitism: It is, as of \\(t_i\\), objectively\nrationally permissible for S to perform a non-maximal set of\nacts, \\(\u03b1_j\\), beginning at \\(t_j (t_i \\lt t_j)\\), if and only\nif, and because, at least one of the objectively rationally\npermissible maximal sets of acts that are, as of \\(t_i\\), scrupulously\nsecurable by S involves S\u2019s performing\n\\(\u03b1_j\\).\n\n\nSecuritism employs a top-down approach by using normative principles\nto directly assess the deontic status of maximal act-sets and then\nextending the same deontic status to non-maximal act-sets that are\ncontained in the relevant maximal act-set (Portmore 2011: 179). This\napproach reaps the benefits of Goldman\u2019s\n (G+)\n of avoiding jointly unfulfillable obligations and of denying that any\nsynchronic counterfactuals even partly determine an agent\u2019s\nobligations.\n\nPortmore\u2019s securitism\u2014and by extension other views that\nhold fixed facts that are not presently up to the agent in some\nsense\u2014has been criticized on the grounds that it does not\ngenerate an obligation to do the best one can in the sense at issue in\nAbility 1, and thus securitism sometimes requires agents to\nperform terrible and vicious acts, and it allows one to avoid\nincurring an obligation in light of vicious or immoral dispositions\n(Timmerman 2015; Vessel 2016).\n\nRoss (2012: 84) similarly maintains that an agent can immediately\nperform an act that requires some attitude that the agent does not in\nfact have, although Portmore\u2019s and Ross\u2019s views diverge in\ncertain cases. Here is Ross\u2019s view (2012: 91):\n\n Momentwise Wide-scope Securitism\n(MWSS): For any x and t, at t, x\nought to be such that, for all \\(t'\\) from t forward, x\nsatisfies the following conditional: For all \\(\\Phi\\), if whether\nx \\(\\Phi\\)s does not causally depend on the intentions x\nhas after \\(t'\\), and if every maximally preferable option that is\ndirectly securable for x at \\(t'\\) involves \\(\\Phi\\)-ing, then\nx \\(\\Phi\\)s.\n\n\nIn essence, MWSS is the view that \u201cat any given time, an agent\nis obligated, at every future time, to be currently satisfying a\nwide-scope version\u201d of Smith\u2019s\n (G+)\n or Portmore\u2019s securitism (Ross 2012: 91). Ross believes that\nonly MWSS can account for each of the four conditions of his core idea\n(2012: 89, 91).\n\n The Core Idea Broken Down: What is obligatory\nfor an agent is that, (i) at all times, she does (ii) the\nbest she can do at that time, (iii) holding fixed what is not\nup to her at that time, but (iv) not holding fixed what is up\nto her at that time.\n\n\nTo see how these views diverge, consider the following case which is\nsimilar to a case described by Ross (2012: 87\u201388): at \\(t_1\\)\nSally has the ability to immediately form an intention to \u27e8not\nkill anyone five years later at \\(t_5\\)\u27e9, although\n\u27e8killing no one at \\(t_5\\)\u27e9 is not scrupulously\nsecurable for Sally at \\(t_1\\). On the other hand, killing exactly one\nperson or killing exactly two persons at \\(t_5\\) are both scrupulously\nsecurable for Sally at \\(t_1\\). According to Portmore\u2019s\nsecuritism, one of the objectively morally permissible maximal set of\nacts that is scrupulously securable by Sally at \\(t_1\\) involves\nkilling one person at \\(t_5\\). However, at \\(t_5\\), not killing anyone\nis scrupulously securable for Sally, and thus at \\(t_5\\) Sally is\nobligated to not kill anyone at \\(t_5\\). These stipulations in\nRoss\u2019s case are derived from the fact that at \\(t_1\\) Sally has\nan impeccable moral character that will be corrupted through no fault\nof her own (by being kidnapped by Satanists). But her moral character\nis not corrupted to such an extent that she is unable at \\(t_5\\) to\nrefrain from killing anyone. To emphasize, at \\(t_1\\) the best\nefficacious intention that Sally can form involves killing one person\nat \\(t_5\\) whereas at \\(t_5\\) the best efficacious intention that\nSally can form involves killing no one at \\(t_5\\). Portmore\u2019s\nsecuritism thus prescribes an act at some future time, but then does\nnot prescribe that act once that time is present.\n\nRoss (2012: 87\u201389) wishes to avoid this implication.\n MWSS\n does not imply that at \\(t_1\\) Sally is obligated to kill exactly one\nperson at \\(t_5\\) because whether Sally kills exactly one person at\n\\(t_5\\) causally depends upon her intentions at \\(t_1\\). So, Sally\nsatisfies the following conditional by not satisfying the first part\nof the antecedent: (if whether Sally refrains from killing exactly one\nperson at \\(t_5\\) does not causally depend on the intentions she will\nhave after \\(t_1\\), and if all her maximally preferable, directly\nsecurable options involve killing exactly one person at \\(t_5\\), then\nshe kills exactly one person at \\(t_5)\\). Instead, MWSS implies that\nat \\(t_1\\) (and at \\(t_5)\\) Sally is obligated not to kill anyone\nbecause she satisfies the following conditional only by satisfying its\nconsequent: (if whether Sally kills no one at \\(t_5\\) does not\ncausally depend on the intentions she will have after \\(t_5\\), and if\nall her maximally preferable, directly securable options involve not\nkilling anyone at \\(t_5\\), then she kills no one at \\(t_5)\\).\n\nA proponent of securitism may reply that there\u2019s simply nothing\nSally can do at \\(t_1\\) that allows her to secure not killing anyone\nat \\(t_5\\), and thus having an obligation at \\(t_1\\) not to kill\nanyone at \\(t_5\\) concedes too much to possibilism. For, one of the\ncore intuitions driving securitist views is that we should treat our\nnon-securable futures in the same way we treat the futures of other\nagents; we should hold such futures fixed when determining our present\nmoral obligations. This thought has led to an expansive discussion of\nthe way in which actualist-possibilist scenarios raise fundamental\nquestions about agency and how we are to conceive of our present\nselves in relation to our future selves (Louise 2009; Baker 2012).\n5. Non-Primary Obligations\n\nThe discussion up until this point has centered around making sense of\nthe general notion that an agent ought to do the (non-supererogatory)\nbest that she is able to do. But some theories hold that an\nagent\u2019s moral life is more complex than this because an\nagent\u2019s ability to do less than the (non-supererogatory) best is\nalso obligatory is some non-primary sense. This approach is motivated\nin part by the thought that some wrong actions are better than others.\nMichael McKinsey (1979: 391\u2013392) develops this approach,\ndefending a view with multiple levels of obligation. His view may be\nformulated as follows:\n\n\n\nLevels of Obligation (LO): \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) is a life\nsequence from t for x. Every \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) has a rank\n\\(n (n \\ge 1)\\) relative to every other life-sequence from t\nfor x, where n is a positive integer. If \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\)\nis among the optimum life sequences from t for x, then\nthe rank of \\(\\phi_{x,t} = 1\\); if \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) is among the second\nbest such sequences, then the rank of \\(\\phi_{x,t} = 2\\); and so on.\nx ought\\(_n\\) at t to do \\(A_i\\) iff:\n\n \\(A_i\\) is contained in every\n\\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) of rank n.\n For every \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) which has a\nrank m higher than n (i.e., where \\(m \\lt n)\\), there is\nan \\(A_j\\) such that \\(\\phi_{x,t}\\) contains \\(A_j\\) and x will\nnot do \\(A_j\\).\n \n\n\nWhile McKinsey\u2019s formulation of (LO) is rather complicated, the\nbasic idea is quite simple. According to (LO), an agent\nS\u2019s primary obligation is identical to the obligation\nthat possibilists believe S has. Additionally, for every\nmaximal act-set M (or a life) that, at t, S can\nperform, if M is not identical to the best maximal act-set\nthat, at t, S can perform, but is better than the\nmaximal act-set that S will in fact perform, then at t\nS has a moral obligation to perform M. To illustrate,\nconsider this case:\n\n The Buttons: At t Ben can both\npress and refrain from pressing any of the three buttons in front of\nhim, and doing any of these things comes at little to no cost to Ben.\nPressing no button results in no deaths, pressing the first button\nresults in one death, pressing the second button results in two\ndeaths, and pressing the third button results in three deaths. Suppose\nthat Ben presses the third button, resulting in three deaths.\n\n\n(LO)\n implies that there are three levels of obligations that Ben fails to\nfulfill: his primary obligation to refrain from pressing any button,\nhis secondary obligation to press the first button, and his tertiary\nobligation to press the second button. If Ben were to instead press\nthe second button, then Ben would have failed to fulfill only two\nobligations, viz. the primary obligation to refrain from pressing a\nbutton, and the secondary obligation to press the first button. \n\nMcKinsey\u2019s\n (LO)\n is, in one sense, in agreement with possibilism because an\nagent\u2019s primary obligation is identical to a possibilist\nobligation. Moreover, even though (LO) can generate jointly\nunfulfillable obligations, (LO) agrees with Jackson and\nPargetter\u2019s contextualist actualism that if, in the terminology\nof (LO), an agent fulfills her primary obligation, then it\u2019s not\nthe case that the agent violates any non-primary obligations because\nthe agent simply does not have any non-primary obligations. For\nexample, if Ben refrains from pressing any button, then according to\n(LO) it\u2019s not the case that Ben had a secondary obligation to\npress the first button, and thus no non-primary obligations are\nviolated. McKinsey\u2019s (LO) is, in a sense, also in agreement with\n(non-contextualist) versions of actualism. For example,\nProcrastinate\u2019s obligation according to non-contextualist\nversions of actualism is to \u27e8decline to review the paper &\nnot review the paper\u27e9, and, according to McKinsey, this is\nProcrastinate\u2019s secondary obligation because this act-sequence\nis the second best maximal act-sequence (or a part of the second best\nmaximal act-sequence) that Procrastinate can perform over time. \n\nGoldman (1978: 205\u2013208) holds that there are exactly two orders\nof obligations, one primary and one secondary, and that it is better\nto fulfill one\u2019s secondary obligation rather than to violate\nboth obligations. Primary obligations are governed by Goldman\u2019s\n (G+),\n and secondary obligations are governed by principles such as\nGoldman\u2019s (1976)\n (G*1)\n which, as we have seen in\n section 4,\n does not take into account an agent\u2019s moral character that\ndetermines the truth-value of certain synchronic counterfactuals. For\nexample, in the case of Professor Procrastinate*,\nProcrastinate\u2019s primary obligation is to \u27e8agree to review\nthe paper & review the paper\u27e9 because there is an\nimmediately performable, fully specific simultaneous act-set such\nthat, if performed, would result in \u27e8agreeing & reviewing\nthe paper\u27e9. By contrast, Procrastinate\u2019s secondary\nobligation is to \u27e8decline to review the paper & not review\nthe paper\u27e9 because Procrastinate\u2019s moral character is\nsuch that if Procrastinate were to \u27e8agree to review\u27e9 at\n\\(t_1\\), then Procrastinate would harm the student by falsely\npromising to review at \\(t_2\\). Procrastinate\u2019s moral character\nis taken into account by her secondary obligation, but not her primary\nobligation. As Goldman (1986: 205) notes, it is sometimes useful to\nreason in a way that holds fixed our actual moral character, and\npositing secondary obligations allows us to reason in this way.\nZimmerman (1986: 70) also subscribes to non-primary obligations and\nmotivates this position in part on the basis of considerations about\ndetachment and conditional obligations.\n6. The Maximalism/Omnism Debate\n\nThe issues raised by the actualist/possibilist debate are relevant for\na number of other debates in philosophy as well. As has already been\ndiscussed, whether actualism, possibilism, or some intermediary view\nis correct has direct import for various principles in deontic logic,\nthe correct formulation of act-consequentialism, and for analogous\nquestions in the philosophy of action. The actualism/possibilism\ndebate, however, is perhaps most closely connected to the\nmaximalism/omnism debate. These debates are deeply interrelated. While\nboth concern questions about the scope of the agent\u2019s options,\nthe maximalism/omnism debate focuses on certain questions about how to\nassess these options. Maximalists and omnists disagree about whether\nall options should be assessed in terms of their own goodness, or\nwhether some options should be assessed in relation to the goodness of\nother options. Maximalists and omnists disagree about which facts\nground the reasons to perform the relevant options and, as will be\nillustrated shortly, are concerned with a wider range of cases than\nthose in the actualism/possibilism debate.\n\nThe maximalism/omnism debate concerns cases where the performance of\none option entails (or implies) the performance of another. Cases such\nas Professor Procrastinate are but one example.\nProcrastinate\u2019s \u27e8accepting the invitation and writing the\nreview\u27e9 entails \u27e8accepting the invitation\u27e9. Not\nall examples share Procrastinate\u2019s structure, however. Many\nexamples concern different ways of performing the same option in\ndifferent (e.g., more or less precise, better or worse) ways. For\ninstance, \u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 entails \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9, \u27e8visiting Uppsala\u27e9 entails\n\u27e8visiting Sweden\u27e9, and \u27e8kicking someone very\nhard\u27e9 entails \u27e8kicking someone\u27e9.\n\nNow, the central question in the debate concerns how the moral\nproperties of an option O are related to the moral properties\nof the options entailed by performing O. This abstract question\ncan be made clearer by considering an example. Suppose that I have\ngood reason to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9 and good reason to\n\u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9. Those in the maximalism/omnism debate\nare interested in whether the reason I have for performing one these\noptions grounds the reason I have for performing the other. Is it the\ncase that I have reason to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9 in virtue of\nmy having reason to \u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9 or vice versa? Or is\nthere no grounding relation between my reason(s) to perform these\noptions?\n\nOmnists hold that all options should be directly assessed in terms of\ntheir own goodness. Omnism may be defined more precisely as\nfollows.\n\n Omnism: All permissible options are permissible\nin virtue of having right-making property p. The property\np is right-making not only for all maximal options, but also\nfor all non-maximal options. (Portmore 2017a: 431)\n\n\nIn this debate, a maximal option is simply understood as one that is\nnot entailed by any other option, aside from itself (Brown 2018: 752).\nMore precisely, a maximal option may be understood as \u201can option\nthat is maximally normatively specific in the sense that it is\nentailed only by normatively equivalent options\u201d, where two\noptions are normatively equivalent if and only if they are equivalent\nin terms of all of the normatively relevant considerations (Portmore\n2017a: 428, 2017b: 2955). Any option that is not a maximal option will\nbe a non-maximal option.\n\nTo illustrate, suppose that hedonistic act-utilitarianism is true. To\nkeep things simple, suppose that the maximal options available to an\nagent S are \u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9, \u27e8drink nothing\nwhile smiling\u27e9, \u27e8drink nothing while frowning\u27e9,\nand \u27e8drink a Pepsi\u27e9. Suppose furthermore that\n\u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 would generate 5 hedons,\n\u27e8drinking nothing while smiling\u27e9 would generate 1 hedon,\n\u27e8drinking nothing while frowning\u27e9 would generate 0\nhedons, and \u27e8drinking a Pepsi\u27e9 would generate 10 dolors\n(or \u221210 hedons). The non-maximal options available to S\ninclude \u27e8drinking a soda\u27e9 and \u27e8drinking\nnothing\u27e9. Finally, suppose that the following counterfactuals\nare true.\n\n If S were to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9, S would\n\u27e8drink a Pepsi\u27e9.\n If S were to \u27e8drink nothing\u27e9, S would\n\u27e8drink nothing while smiling\u27e9.\n\n\nAccording to omnism, whether it is permissible for S to\n\u27e8drink a soda\u27e9 depends on whether \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9 would result in maximizing hedonic utility. Given the\ntruth of (1), it wouldn\u2019t, so omnism entails that\n\u27e8drinking a soda\u27e9 is wrong. Likewise, according to\nomnism, whether it is permissible for S to \u27e8drink a\nCoke\u27e9 depends on whether S\u2019s \u27e8drinking a\nCoke\u27e9 would result in maximizing hedonic utility. It does, so\nomnism entails that \u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 is permissible\n(and obligatory).\n\nUnlike omnists, maximalists hold that only maximal options should be\nassessed in terms of their own goodness. They believe that all\nnon-maximal options should only be assessed in terms of the goodness\nof the relevant maximal options of which they are a part. Maximalism\nmay be defined more precisely as follows.\n\n Maximalism: Not all permissible options are\npermissible in virtue of having right-making property p.\n(Max\\(_1\\)) p is right-making for all and only maximal options,\nbut (Max\\(_2\\)) the property of being entailed by a maximal option\nthat has p is right-making for all and only non-maximal options\n(Portmore 2017a: 429).\n\n\nAssuming hedonistic act-utilitarianism once again, according to\nmaximalism, the deontic status of the maximal options depends on the\noutcome of performing each option. According to maximalism, then,\n\u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 would be obligatory and every other\nmaximal option would be impermissible. So, with respect to maximal\noptions, maximalism and omnism generate the same deontic verdicts. But\nnow consider what maximalists say about non-maximal options. This is\nthe point of contention between maximalists and omnists. By contrast\nwith the omnist\u2019s ascription of wrongness to \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9, the maximalist holds that \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9 is obligatory. This is because the obligatory maximal\noption is \u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9 and S cannot perform the\nmaximal option of \u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 without performing\nthe non-maximal option of \u27e8drinking a soda\u27e9. The\nnon-maximal act \u27e8drink nothing\u27e9, on the other hand, is\nentailed by an impermissible act, namely \u27e8drink nothing while\nsmiling\u27e9. So, maximalism entails that \u27e8drinking\nnothing\u27e9 is impermissible.\n\nInterestingly, omnism has typically been assumed in the literature. It\nmay have only operated as an unquestioned background assumption until\nthe groundbreaking work of Bergstr\u00f6m (1966) and Casta\u00f1eda\n(1968). Goldman (1978) and Bykvist (2002) defend distinct variants of\nmaximalism. Since then, there have been a few arguments against\nmaximalism (cf. Gustafsson 2014). Omnism seems to be considered the\ndefault position, though new arguments against omnism and in favor of\nmaximalism have started to appear in the literature recently (Portmore\n2017a,b, forthcoming; Brown 2018). Much of the debate revolves around\ntheProblem of Act Versions. Following Brown (2018: 754) and\nPortmore (forthcoming: ch. 4), this problem may be explained by\nconsidering the following three jointly inconsistent principles.\n\n(1)\nAn agent S\n    ought to perform an act \\(\\phi\\) if and only if \\(\\phi\\)-ing is her\n    best option.\n(2)\nRule (NI) If \\({\\vdash} A \\rightarrow B\\) then\n  \\({\\vdash} \\rO(A) \\rightarrow \\rO(B)\\)\n(3)\nOptimality is not closed under implication.\n\n\n\nEach of these principles seems quite plausible when considered in\nisolation. Principle (1) simply holds that an agent ought to perform\nthe best option available to her. Assuming hedonistic\nact-utilitarianism, the best option(s) will be whichever one(s)\nmaximize(s) hedonic utility. Principle (2) holds that if an agent is\nobligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) and her performing\n\\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) entails her performing \\(\\langle B \\rangle\\),\nthen she is obligated to perform \\(\\langle B \\rangle\\). So, if an\nagent is obligated to \u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9 and\n\u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9 entails \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9, then that agent is obligated to \u27e8drink a\nsoda\u27e9. \n\nPrinciple (3) holds that there are cases where an agent\nS\u2019s obligatory option (e.g., a maximal option) entails\nanother option (e.g., a non-maximal option) that, if performed, would\nnot result in S performing the obligatory maximal\noption. Performing the best option of \u27e8drinking a Coke\u27e9\nentails that S \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9. But what would in\nfact happen if S were to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9 is that\nS would \u27e8drink a Pepsi\u27e9 and \u27e8drinking a\nPepsi\u27e9 is not S\u2019s best option. That is, in fact,\nthe worst option.\n\nMaximalists have objected to omnism on the grounds that it, in\nconjunction with (2) and (3), entails a contradiction (Portmore\nforthcoming: ch. 4). Given omnism, S is obligated to\n\u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9 because performing that act is\nS\u2019s best option. S\u2019s \u27e8drinking a\nCoke\u27e9 entails S\u2019s \u27e8drinking a soda\u27e9.\nSo, given (2), S is also obligated to \u27e8drink a\nsoda\u27e9. However, recall that this case illustrates principle\n(3). If S were to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9, S would\n\u27e8drink a Pepsi\u27e9. Given this, \u27e8drinking a\nsoda\u27e9 would not result in S performing her best option.\nSo, omnism also entails that it is impermissible for S to\n\u27e8drink a soda\u27e9. Hence the contradiction. Omnism combined\nwith (2) and (3) entail both that S is obligated to\n\u27e8drink a soda\u27e9 and that it\u2019s impermissible for\nS to \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9. To avoid this contradiction,\nomnists must give up (2) or (3). Omnists such as Jackson and Pargetter\nhave given up (2).\n\nMaximalists reject omnism, which allows them to consistently accept\n(2) and (3), principles thought to have strong independent motivation.\nMaximalists, then, give up (1) to avoid the contradiction. According\nto the maximalist, sometimes agents are obligated to perform\nnon-maximal options (e.g., \u27e8drink a soda\u27e9) that are not\ntheir best option in virtue of the fact that they are obligated to\nperform their best maximal option (e.g., \u27e8drink a Coke\u27e9)\nand performing their best maximal option entails performing a\nsuboptimal non-maximal option. In short, the maximalist responds to\nthe Problem of Act Versions by giving up (1), while omnists\nrespond by giving up (2). As may already be clear, some motivations\nfor, and against, omnism parallel those of actualism, while some\nmotivations for, and against, maximalism parallel those of securitism\nand possibilism. Whichever considerations settle one of these debates\nwill likely settle (or at least significantly bear on) the other.\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe actualism/possibilism (and the maximalism/omnism) debate in ethics\ngrew out of a debate concerning the problem that identifying act\nalternatives poses for act-consequentialism. The debate, in its\npresent form, may be traced back to the work of Holly Goldman\u2019s\nand Jordan Howard Sobel\u2019s independent articulations, and\ndefenses of, actualism. Early forms of actualism held that whether an\nagent is obligated to perform an act roughly depends on whether what\nwould happen if the agent performed that act is better than\nwhat would happen if the agent were to perform any alternative act at\nthe time in question. Contrast this with possibilism, which holds that\nwhether an agent is obligated to perform an act depends on whether\nthat act is part of the best maximal act-set the agent could\n(not would) perform over the course of her life. These are\nthe \u201cextreme\u201d versions of actualism and possibilism\nrespectively. To handle cases concerning synchronic acts, and to avoid\nhaving her view prescribe incompatible obligations, Goldman amended\nactualism by building a control condition into the definition in her\n(1978) essay. This revised actualism,\n (G+),\n along with Sobel\u2019s\n (S),\n only holds fixed the acts of an agent that are not presently under\nthe agent\u2019s control. This change proved influential and inspired\nvarious versions of this view, which came to be collectively referred\nto as securitism. Securitist views occupy a middle ground between\n\u201cextreme\u201d forms of actualism and possibilism. A variety of\nother views do too, including McKinsey\u2019s (1979)\nlevels-of-obligation view and Carlson\u2019s (1995, 1999) view. There\nis not yet a consensus about which view, if any, is the most\nplausible. Of course, this should not be surprising since the\nactualism/possibilism (and the maximalism/omnism) debate is,\nrelatively speaking, still quite new.",
