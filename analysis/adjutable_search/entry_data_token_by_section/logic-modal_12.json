Modal Logic and Games\n\nThe interaction between the theory of games and modal logic is a\nflourishing new area of research (van der Hoek and Pauly, 2007; van\nBenthem, 2011, Ch. 10, and 2014). This work has interesting\napplications to understanding cooperation and competition among agents\nas information available to them evolves. \n\nThe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma illustrates some of the concepts in game\ntheory that can be analyzed using modal logics. Imagine two players\nthat choose to either cooperate or defect. If both cooperate, they\nboth achieve a reward of 3 points, if they both defect, they both get\n1 point, and if one cooperates and the other defects, the defector\nmakes off with 5 points and the cooperator gets nothing. If both\nplayers are altruistic and motivated to maximize the sum of their\nrewards, they will both cooperate, as this is the best they can do\ntogether. However, they are both tempted to defect to increase their\nown reward from 3 to 5, leaving their opponent with nothing. On the\nother hand, if they are both rational, they may recognize that if\ndefection is the best strategy, their opponent will choose this as\nwell, leaving them with only 1 point. So unless there is enough trust\nbetween the players to motivate cooperation, they will be doomed to\nreceiving 1 point apiece. However, if each thinks the other realizes\nthis, they may be willing to risk cooperating anyway.\n\nAn extended (or iterated) version of this game gives the players\nmultiple moves, that is, repeated opportunities to play and collect\nrewards. If players have information about the history of the moves\nand their outcomes, new concerns come into play, as success in the\ngame depends on knowing their opponent\u2019s strategy and\ndetermining (for example) when he/she can be trusted not to defect. In\nmulti-player versions of the game, where players are drawn in pairs\nfrom a larger pool at each move, one\u2019s own best strategy may\nwell depend on whether one can recognize one\u2019s opponents and the\nstrategies they have adopted. (See Grim et. al., 1998 for fascinating\nresearch on Interated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemmas.) \n\nIn games like Chess, players take turns making their moves and their\nopponents can see the moves made. If we adopt the convention that the\nplayers in a game take turns making their moves, then the Iterated\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma is a game with missing information about the\nstate of play \u2013 the player with the second turn lacks\ninformation about what the other player\u2019s last move was. This\nillustrates the interest of games with imperfect information. \n\nThe application of games to logic has a long history. One influential\napplication with important implications for linguistics is Game\nTheoretic Semantics (GTS) (Hintikka et. al. 1983), where validity is\ndefined by the outcome of a game between two players, one trying to\nverify and the other trying to falsify a given formula. GTS has\nsignificantly stronger resources that standard Tarski-style semantics,\nas it can be used (for example) to explain how meaning evolves in a\ndiscourse (a sequence of sentences).\n\nHowever, the work on games and modal logic to be described here is\nsomewhat different. Instead of using games to analyze the semantics of\na logic, the modal logics at issue are used to analyze games. The\nstructure of games and their play is very rich, as it involves the\nnature of the game itself (the allowed moves and the rewards for the\noutcomes), the strategies (which are sequences of moves through time),\nand the flow of information available to the players as the game\nprogresses. Therefore, the development of modal logic for games draws\non features found in logics involving concepts like time, agency,\npreference, goals, knowledge, belief, and cooperation. \n\nTo provide some hint at this variety, here is a limited description of\nsome of the modal operators that turn up in the analysis of games and\nsome of the things that can be expressed with them. The basic idea in\nthe semantics is that a game consists of a set of players 1, 2, 3,\n\u2026, and a set of W of game states. For each player \\(i\\), there\nis an accessibility relation \\(R_i\\) understood so that \\(sR_i t\\)\nholds for states \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) iff when the game has come to state\n\\(s\\) player \\(i\\) has the option of making a move that results in\n\\(t\\). This collection of relations defines a tree whose branches\ndefine every possible sequence of moves in the game. The semantics\nalso assigns truth-values to atoms that keep track of the payoffs. So,\nfor example in a game like Chess, there could be an atom \\(\\win_i\\)\nsuch that \\(v(\\win_i, s)=T\\) iff state \\(s\\) is a win for player\n\\(i\\). Model operators \\(\\Box_i\\) and \\(\\Diamond_i\\) for each player\n\\(i\\) may then be given truth conditions as follows. \n\\[\\begin{align*}\nv(\\Box_i A, s) &=T \\text{ iff for all } t \\text{ in } W, \\text{ if } sR_i t, \\text{ then } v(A, t)=T. \\\\\nv(\\Diamond_i A, s) &=T \\text{ iff for some } t \\text{ in } W, sR_i t \\text{ and }v(A, t)=T.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nSo \\(\\Box_i A\\) \\((\\Diamond_i A)\\) is true in s provided that sentence\n\\(A\\) holds true in every (some) state that \\(i\\) can chose from state\n\\(s\\). Given that \\(\\bot\\) is a contradiction (so \\({\\sim}\\bot\\) is a\ntautology), \\(\\Diamond_i {\\sim}\\bot\\) is true at a state when it is\n\\(i\\)\u2019s turn to move. For a two-player game \\(\\Box_1\\bot\\) &\n\\(\\Box_2\\bot\\) is true of a state that ends the game, because neither\n1 nor 2 can move. \\(\\Box_1\\Diamond_2\\)win\\(_2\\) asserts that player 1\nhas a loss because whatever 1 does from the present state, 2 can win\nin the following move. \n\nFor a more general account of the player\u2019s payoffs, ordering\nrelations \\(\\leq_i\\) can be defined over the states so that \\(s\\leq_i\nt\\) means that \\(i\\)\u2019s payoff for \\(t\\) is at least as good as\nthat for \\(s\\). Another generalization is to express facts about\nsequences \\(q\\) of moves, by introducing operators interpreted by\nrelations \\(sR_q t\\) indicating that the sequence \\(q\\) starting from\ns eventually arrives at \\(t\\). With these and related resources, it is\npossible to express (for example) that \\(q\\) is \\(i\\)\u2019s best\nstrategy given the present state.\n\nIt is crucial to the analysis of games to have a way to express the\ninformation available to the players. One way to accomplish this is to\nborrow ideas from epistemic logic. Here we may introduce an\naccessibility relation \\({\\sim}_i\\) for each player such that\n\\(s{\\sim}_i t\\) holds iff \\(i\\) cannot distinguish between states\n\\(s\\) and \\(t\\). Then knowledge operators \\(\\rK_i\\) for the players\ncan be defined so that \\(\\rK_i A\\) says at \\(s\\) that \\(A\\) holds in\nall worlds that \\(i\\) cannot distinguish from \\(s\\); that is, despite\n\\(i\\)\u2019s ignorance about the state of play, he/she can still be\nconfident that \\(A\\). \\(\\rK\\) operators may be used to say that player\n1 is in a position to resign, for he knows that 2 sees she has a win:\n\\(\\rK_1 \\rK_2\\Box_1\\Diamond_2\\win_2\\).\n\nSince player\u2019s information varies as the game progresses, it is\nuseful to think of moves of the game as indexed by times, and to\nintroduce operators \\(O\\) and \\(U\\) from tense logic for\n\u2018next\u2019 and \u2018until\u2019. Then \\(K_i OA \\rightarrow\nOK_i A\\) expresses that player \\(i\\) has \u201cperfect recall\u201d,\nthat is, that when \\(i\\) knows that \\(A\\) happens next, then at the\nnext moment \\(i\\) has not forgotten that \\(A\\) has happened. This\nillustrates how modal logics for games can reflect cognitive\nidealizations and a player\u2019s success (or failure) at living up\nto them.\n\nThe technical side of the modal logics for games is challenging. The\nproject of identifying systems of rules that are sound and complete\nfor a language containing a large collection of operators may be\nguided by past research, but the interactions between the variety of\naccessibility relations leads to new concerns. Furthermore, the\ncomputational complexity of various systems and their fragments is a\nlarge landscape largely unexplored.\n\nGame theoretic concepts can be applied in a surprising variety of ways\n\u2013 from checking an argument for validity to succeeding in the\npolitical arena. So there are strong motivations for formulating\nlogics that can handle games. What is striking about this research is\nthe power one obtains by weaving together logics of time, agency,\nknowledge, belief, and preference in a unified setting. The lessons\nlearned from that integration have value well beyond what they\ncontribute to understanding games.\n",
