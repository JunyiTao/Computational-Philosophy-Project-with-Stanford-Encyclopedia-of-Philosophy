    "main_text": "Natural Law, Political Theory and the Rise of International Law || Natural Law\n5.1 Natural Law\n\nOne of the generally acknowledged merits of the School of Salamanca\nwas the revival of natural law or at least its Thomist version. This\nwas more or less closely connected to commentaries on the second part\nof Thomas Aquinas\u2019s Summa theologiae. Vitoria\u2019s\nlectures on the quaestiones 90\u2013105 of the Prima\nsecundae, entitled De lege, dealing with the different\nkinds of law, and his voluminous commentary on the Secunda\nsecundae are now available in critical editions by Vicente\nBeltr\u00e1n de Heredia. Molina described his monumental De\niustitia et iure, which in current forms of printing would take\nup around 6,000 pages, as a commentary on quaestiones\n57\u201379 in the Secunda secundae, but he admitted that he\nwas not following Thomas precisely and that his theory covered a wider\nrange compared to what had been discussed by \u201cDivus\nThomas\u201d. Whether the ten volumes of Su\u00e1rez\u2019s De\nlegibus ac Deo legislatore are primarily to be seen as a\ncommentary on quaestiones 90\u2013108 of the Prima\nsecundae is still debated by modern scholars. Soto, who is\nmentioned by Su\u00e1rez as one of his main sources besides Thomas\nAquinas, commented on questions from both the Prima secundae\nand Secunda secundae in the ten books of his extremely\ninfluential treatise De iustitia et iure. The common\nbackground for all the authors of the School of Salamanca, as well as\ntheir Jesuit successors, who dealt with law, natural law and justice\nwas, therefore, Thomas Aquinas\u2019s division of the different kinds\nof law in the Prima secundae and his reflections on the\ndifferent meanings of justice, law and right from the Secunda\nsecundae, whether they followed him or not.\n\nThe classification of laws in the Summa (Ia IIae, qu.\n91\u20134) begins with God\u2019s regulation of the universe via the\neternal law, manifest to humans through revealed divine law and\nthrough natural law, which was accessible by reason. Humans, even\nthose lacking revelation, could derive from natural law the principles\nfor enacting human law. Human law, inevitably, had to be adapted to\ntime, place and climate and was, therefore, limited. Nor was reason\nable to craft laws covering all contingencies. They had to be useful\nto the commonwealth and also mutable if circumstances changed.\nDispensations were required where a law did not apply in a particular\ncase. Disobeying laws was a vice, while obeying them was a virtue.\nDivine law, embodied in the Old Law or the New Law, which regulated\ncontingent elements of religious cult, but also the punishment of\nthose who had escaped human justice, was in accordance with natural\nlaw and eternal law. Human laws were invalid if they contradicted\neither divine or natural law. In the quaestiones 57\u201379\nof the Secunda secundae, Thomas addressed questions such as\n\u201cWhether right is the object of justice\u201d, and \u201cWhat\nis justice?\u201d; he also discussed judgment, kinds of justice,\nrestitution, injustice, kinds of injustice and so on.\n\nVitoria followed this schema in his lectures on the Summa\ntheologiae, especially in his 1533\u20131534 lectures and in his\ncommentary. He treated law as made by \u201creason and\nenlightenment\u201d, not just the will. Natural law, derived from\neternal law by reason, was binding on all humanity; its principles\napplied to mutable situations and different peoples. God was the\nindirect cause of human laws, which were binding on the consciences of\nindividuals. There was a human urge to obey natural law, for example,\nby honoring one\u2019s parents, preferably out of love. Failure to\nheed these precepts was a moral fault.\n\nThe gospel was valid when promulgated by Christ, but barbarians\nignorant of the gospel might violate its commands in a pardonable way.\nThe Church had general laws which were applicable anywhere, and\nfailure to obey them was sinful. Human legislators could enact laws\nfavoring religion, but they must not confuse their role with that of\nthe clergy under divine law.\n\nHuman laws were intended to serve the common good, not the interests\nof the legislator, who was \u201cthe servant of the\ncommonwealth\u201d. Any \u201cperfect\u201d community, sacred or\nsecular, had the power to make and enforce laws. Human laws were\nbinding once publicly promulgated; but the Church had its laws from\nGod. The Church had one ruler on earth, the pope, the vicar of Christ,\njust as the universe was ruled by God; but, like other rulers, the\nRoman pontiff delegated power for its effective exercise.\n\nDespite the preeminent place that Thomas Aquinas occupied for these\nauthors, there are significant deviations from the Thomist concept of\nnatural law that are shared by some of them, who at times also\ndirectly criticized the \u201cDoctor Angelicus\u201d. Su\u00e1rez,\nfor instance, says that law has to be seen as something that rules the\nbehavior of beings capable of free decisions (De legibus I\niii 2); therefore, Thomas\u2019s concept of an eternal law that rules\nthe whole universe can be understood as a law only in a metaphorical\nsense. There are still ongoing debates as to whether eternal law can\nbe seen as the theological basis of all other kinds of law\n(Schweigh\u00f6fer 2018: 234\u2013256). Natural law, for Thomas, on\nthe one hand, is known to humans because of their participation as\nrational beings in eternal law, but, on the other, it is at least\npartially shared with animals (Summa theologiae Ia IIae qu.\n95 art. 4 ad 1; IIa IIae quaestio 57 art. 3 co) in parallel\nto Roman Law (Digest 1.1.1.4). Its role for Thomas was labeled as\nsomething like a \u201cstyle\u201d, i.e., a universal principle\n(Westerman 1998: 81) governing animate nature. For Su\u00e1rez it\nbecomes a device to rule the behavior of humans as rational beings who\nare responsible for their activities. It not only contains the most\ngeneral principles of law, leaving the more detailed regulations to\nhuman law, but also everything that follows logically from these\nprinciples; otherwise not even the ten commandments would belong to\nnatural law. According to Su\u00e1rez, natural law is the voice of\nright reason which effects human behavior via man\u2019s conscience,\nand \n\n\na man who is led by this law is said to be his own law, because he has\nthe law written within himself\n\ndicitur homo, qui illo ducitur, sibi lex, quia habet in se\nscriptam legem. (De legibus II v 9\u201310) \n\n\nThis conceptual shift was initiated at least implicitly by Vitoria in\nhis commentary on quaestio 57. Thomas gives as an example of\nwhat is just by nature in an absolute sense the natural inclination of\nthe male to the female for the sake of procreation and the efforts of\nparents to nurture their children. Vitoria replaces these examples by\nthe obligation to return deposits and the Golden Rule. This\nmoralization of natural law is not found in all the authors under\nconsideration. Molina, for example, argues that someone who uses the\nextreme poverty of another to make that person his slave, instead of\nproviding help without imposing conditions, commits a sin against\ncharity; but the contract is valid according to natural law (De\niustitia et iure II, disp. 34).\n\nThe Salamancan theologians and their successors not only discussed and\nmodified Thomist natural law but also referred to other sources with\nslightly different categorizations, such as the distinction between\nius humanum and ius naturale vel divinum made by\nIsidore of Seville (Liber etymologiarum, lib. 5 c.\n2\u201318), cited in Decretum Gratiani (Gratian [1879: vol.\n1, 1\u20135]) and discussed by Soto (De iustitia et iure I,\nqu. V, art. iii and iv). There were many further differences among\nthem on natural law, as on law in general. For instance, with regard\nto whether law was an act of will or an act of intellect, some, like\nSoto, favored the intellect despite his early education in\nNominalist-dominated Paris, where voluntarism, an emphasis on the will\nover the intellect, prevailed; others, like Su\u00e1rez, gave some\nrelevance to the will. Nevertheless, they were in agreement that the\nprinciples of natural law were inscribed in the hearts of humans, so\nthat \u201cno human being can plead ignorance as an excuse\u201d, as\nSoto put it (De iustitia et iure, I qu. I art. iv; transl.\nHamilton 1963: 15). Su\u00e1rez\u2019s concept of law has been\ndescribed as voluntarist, but reason still played a significant role\nin his thought. Reason diagnosed situations, identifying possible\nremedies; but the will implemented these measures. These deliberations\nhappened within the context of immutable natural law, which\nSu\u00e1rez believed was known through specific precepts. In\naddition, he held that individual virtue lay in following right\nreason. Reason\u2019s dictates were unique to human beings, not\nimpulses shared with animals. The laws common to many peoples, though\nnot universal, made up the ius gentium. What may seem at\nfirst glance an acknowledgement of the moral competence of all human\nbeings was also used to justify punishment, including war and\nenslavement, against peoples from other continents.\n\nIt is the ius gentium, not natural law, that regulates the\ndistribution of property and the enslavement of human beings. The\nimmutable natural law, however, gives permission for these activities,\nbecause, after the Fall, the circumstances of its application changed\ndramatically, making an enforced regulation of possession necessary\n(see, e.g., Su\u00e1rez, De legibus L I xvi 7). Although\nproperty\u2014or dominium as it was called\u2014is not part\nof human nature, according to the majority of Salamancan thinkers and\ntheir followers, there are many reflections by different authors\narguing for the advantages of private property. Soto and Molina make\ndirect use of Aristotelian and Thomist arguments, saying that common\nownership would prevent men from working and from taking care of their\nthings to the disadvantage of the common good (Soto, De iustitia\net iure, IV art. 3; Molina, De iustitia et iure, II 19;\nsee Chafuen 2003: 3\u201338). There are differences concerning the\nway in which dominium in this sense is bound by regulations\nfrom positive and natural law. Most authors, such as Vitoria, in his\ncommentary on quaestio 66 in the Secunda secundae of\nthe Summa theologiae, accepted the Thomist view that those in\nextreme need are entitled to take what is necessary for their\nsurvival. Martin de Azpilcueta (1491\u20131586), known as\n\u201cDoctor Navarrus\u201d or \u201cNavarro\u201d, however, held\nthat there is no obligation to donate to those who are in extreme need\nand that anyone who receives such a donation must see it as a loan,\nnot as something of his own (Chafuen 2003: 44).\n\nSome of these theologians adopted an understanding of the word\nius in the sense of right, even subjective right. This is not\na Salamancan invention but seems to have been initiated in the glosses\nto the Decretum Gratiani and enforced by authors like Ockham\nand Gerson (Tierney 1997). But it plays an important role in arguments\non dominium\u2014a term that oscillates between domination\nand property\u2014and in reflections on the ius gentium. The\nfirst lecture of Vitoria\u2019s De Indis deals with the\nquestion of whether the Indians may be called veri domini,\nthat is, real masters or real possessors, of their goods, and the\nthird lecture claims that they violated the rights of the Spaniards.\nMolina takes this subjective meaning of ius as the\nparadigmatic understanding of the term throughout his voluminous\ntreatise De iustitia et iure. He defines ius as \n\n\na faculty to do or have something or to maintain it or to behave in\nany way such that if it is hindered without legitimate reason an\ninjury is done to the person who has it. This way, that right, in this\nmeaning, becomes something like a measure of injury: because as much\nas it is opposed and damaged without legitimate reason, injury is done\nto the one who has it. (De iustitia et iure II 1) \n\n\nThough it may be exaggerated to call the School of Salamanca the\ncradle of human rights, individual rights are pivotal for a number of\ntheir arguments. Molina states that a slave may have a ius qua\nhomo, even in the special case of a right to things he has won\nfrom his master in gambling and suchlike. Furthermore, he declares\nthat an injustice toward someone is a violation of that person\u2019s\nrights, and he gives a number of examples where injustice is done\ntoward a slave and must be corrected or punished. We may, therefore,\nconclude that slaves also have rights in his system (De iustitia\net iure II 38).\n\nThe issue of slavery in the New World cannot be divorced from racial\nconcerns. African slaves were imported. Also, Spaniards and indigenous\npeoples intermarried with each other and with black slaves.\nClassifications were developed to designate various mixtures. It is\nnotable that these mixed populations received marital privileges the\npapacy issued for converts in the New World. However, ideas of infamy\narose, describing mixed populations with language indicating\ninferiority. Also, this language indicated levels of mixture with\nindigenous populations by proportions as small as one sixteenth. (R.\nHill 2022: 585\u2013611). The discrimination of Africans as a\n\u201cjustification\u201d of enslavement began even before the\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d of America, using, among others, the biblical\nreference to Noah\u2019s curse Genesis 9:20\u201327. However, the\nconcept of race in the modern sense was developed from eighteenth\ncentury onwards, while earlier writers used the term\n\u201cnations\u201d to speak about Africans and Amerindigenous\npeoples who were allegedly \u201clike beasts\u201d and determined to\nserve (Haar & Kaufmann 2023: Kap. 4 and below).\n",
