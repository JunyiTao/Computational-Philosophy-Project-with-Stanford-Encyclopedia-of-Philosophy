    "main_text": "Universal Algebra || Concepts\n3.1 Concepts\n\nFamiliar theorems of number theory emerge in algebraic form for\nalgebras. An algebra \\(A\\) is called directly irreducible or\nsimple when its lattice of congruences is the two-element\nlattice consisting of \\(A\\) and the one-element algebra, paralleling\nthe notion of prime number \\(p\\) as a number whose lattice of divisors\nhas two elements \\(p\\) and 1. However the counterpart of the\nfundamental theorem of arithmetic, that every positive integer factors\nuniquely as a product of primes, requires a more delicate kind of\nproduct than direct product. Birkhoff\u2019s notion of subdirect\nproduct enabled him to prove the Subdirect Representation Theorem,\nthat every algebra arises as the subdirect product of its subdirectly\nirreducible quotients. Whereas there are many subdirectly irreducible\ngroups, the only subdirectly irreducible Boolean algebra is the\ninitial or two-element one, while the subdirectly irreducible rings\nsatisfying \\(x^n = x\\) for some \\(n \\gt 1\\) are exactly the finite\nfields.\n\nAnother central topic is duality: Boolean algebras are dual to Stone\nspaces, complete atomic Boolean algebras are dual to sets,\ndistributive lattices with top and bottom are dual to partially\nordered sets, algebraic lattices are dual to semilattices, and so on.\nDuality provides two ways of looking at an algebra, one of which may\nturn out to be more insightful or easier to work with than the other\ndepending on the application.\n\nThe structure of varieties as classes of all models of some equational\ntheory is also of great interest. The earliest result in this area is\nBirkhoff\u2019s theorem that a class of algebras is a variety if and\nonly if it is closed under formation of quotients (homomorphic\nimages), subalgebras, and arbitrary (including empty and infinite)\ndirect products. This \u201cmodern algebra\u201d result constitutes\na completeness theorem for equational logic in terms of its models.\nIts elementary counterpart is the theorem that the equational theories\non a free algebra \\(F(V)\\), defined as the deductively closed sets of\nequations that use variables from \\(V\\), are exactly its substitutive\ncongruences.\n\nA locally finite variety is one whose finitely generated free algebras\nare finite, such as pointed sets, graphs (whether of the directed or\nundirected variety), and distributive lattices. A congruence\npermutable variety is a variety all of whose algebras are congruence\npermutable. Maltsev characterized these in terms of a necessary and\nsufficient condition on their theories, namely that \\(F\\)(3) contain\nan operation \\(t(x, y, z)\\) for which \\(t(x, x, y) = t(y, x, x) = y\\)\nare in the theory. Analogous notions are congruence distributivity and\ncongruence modularity, for which there exist analogous syntactic\ncharacterizations of varieties of algebras with these properties. A\nmore recently developed power tool for this area is McKenzie\u2019s\nnotion of tame congruences, facilitating the study of the structure of\nfinite algebras.\n\nWithin the algebraic school, varieties have been defined with the\nunderstanding that the operations of a signature form a set. Insights\nfrom category theory, in particular the expression of a variety as a\nmonad, defined as a monoid object in the category \\(C^C\\) of\nendofunctors of a category \\(C\\) (Set in the case of ordinary\nuniversal algebra) indicate that a cleaner and more general notion of\nvariety is obtained when the operations can form a proper class. For\nexample the important classes of complete semilattices, CSLat, and\ncomplete atomic\n Boolean algebras,\n CABA, form varieties only with this broader notion of signature. In\nthe narrow algebraic sense of variety, the dual of a variety can never\nbe a variety, whereas in the broader monadic notion of variety, the\nvariety Set of sets is dual to CABA while CSLat is self-dual.\n",
