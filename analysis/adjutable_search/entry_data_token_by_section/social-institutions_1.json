    "main_text": "Social Institutions and Coordination Equilibria\n2. Social Institutions and Coordination Equilibria\n\nAs noted above, the starting point for theories of social institutions\nutilising a rational choice framework is Lewis\u2019 theory of\nconventions (Lewis 1969). According to Lewis\u2014who was inspired by\nHume (Hume 1740: Book III)\u2014conventions are the solutions to\ncoordination problems. (See also Schwayder 1965.) Thus the regularity\nin behaviour of driving on the right is the solution to the\ncoordination problem confronting road users. Here there are two\nequilibria: everyone driving on the right or, alternatively, everyone\ndriving on the left. Everyone driving on the right is an equilibrium\nsince everyone prefers to drive on the right, given everyone else\ndoes, and everyone expects everyone to drive on the right. Conventions\nare certainly ubiquitous. However, social institutions evidently\nconsist in more than conventions. Importantly, as noted above, they\nconsist in part in rules, including but not restricted to laws and\nregulations. But regularities in behaviour that result from compliance\nwith rules are not necessarily equilibria in the sense in use in\nrational choice theory. Accordingly, a serviceable account of social\ninstitutions looks like it needs to help itself (at least) to both\nconventions (or, at least, equilibria in the sense of Nash equilibria,\ni.e. (roughly) a combination of actions such that no actor has an\nincentive to change his or her action unilaterally), and rules. \n\nGuala has propounded an account of institutions he refers to as the\nrules-in-equilibrium approach. This account, as its name suggests,\nseeks to unify the rules-based conception of institutions and the view\nthat institutions are the equilibria of strategic games (Guala 2016).\nAs such, institutions facilitate coordination and cooperation; indeed,\nthat is their defining function. However, regularities in behaviour in\naccordance with an equilibrium strategy, e.g. everyone driving on the\nleft, typically take the form of a rule, e.g. \u2018Drive on the\nleft\u2019. Therefore, according to Guala, essentially institutions\nare rules that people are motivated to follow, i.e. rules backed up by\na system of incentives and expectations that motivate people to follow\nthese rules. Accordingly, and in contrast with collective acceptance\naccounts (see section 3 below), there is no need to posit joint\nintentions or the like in order to ensure the rules in part\nconstitutive of an institution are followed\u2014or otherwise to\nprovide the \u2018glue\u2019 that holds an institution together.\n\n\nMoreover, contra Searle (1995) and (again) contra the\ncollective acceptance account (see section 3 below), for the most part\ninstitutional rules are merely regulative and not constitutive (Guala\n2016: ch.5). Roughly speaking, a regulative rule governs a\npre-existing action type, e.g. \u2018Do not walk on the grass\u2019,\nwhereas constitutive rules (supposedly) create new forms of activity,\ne.g. the rules of chess, and have the form \u2018X counts as Y in\ncircumstances, C\u2019 (Searle 2010: 96). According to Guala,\nconstitutive rules are not necessary to institutions; regulative rules\nare sufficient. (See section 3 below.) \n\nGuala\u2019s account has implications for controversies concerning\nalleged differences between the natural sciences and the social\nsciences and, specifically, for the pluralist view that unlike natural\nentities, social entities, such as institutions, are mind-dependent\n(Searle 2010). For example, the fact that a dollar bill is money and\nnot merely paper, depends on a collective belief that it can be used\nas a medium of exchange. By contrast, a molecule of water is water\nirrespective of anyone\u2019s belief. At this point Guala invokes a\ndistinction between causal dependence and ontological dependence.\nDollar bills are causally dependent on beliefs but not ontologically\ndependent. Since the causal dependence of social entities on beliefs\nand the like is consistent with the causal dependence of natural\nentities on one another and on beliefs etc., the mind-dependence of\nsocial entities does not imply a pluralist view of the natural\nsciences and the social sciences. A monist conception is admissible.\n\n\nMoreover, according to Guala, the view that institutions are\nmind-dependent (Searle 2010: 17\u201318) is inconsistent with the existence\nof mistaken beliefs about institutions on the part of participants in\nthose institutions. Guala is certainly right to claim that there are\nsuch mistaken beliefs, e.g. everyone might falsely believe that their\nworthless devalued currency was money. What of his argument that some\nadvocates of the mind-dependence of institutions are necessarily\ncommitted to infallibilism\u2014and, specifically, to the false claim\nthat institutional participants cannot be mistaken about their\ninstitutions? Guala states that infallibilism about social kinds (e.g.\nwe cannot be wrong about whether a piece of paper is money or not) and\nanti-realism (e.g. a piece of paper is money if we collectively accept\nthat it is) go together and do so \u201cbecause their\nopposites\u2014realism and fallibilism are tightly connected\u201d\n(Guala 2016:151). If objects exist independently of our\nrepresentations of them (realism) then our representations can be\nmistaken (fallibilism). On the other hand, if objects ontologically\ndepend on our representations of them (anti-realism)\u2014and, in\nparticular, our collective beliefs about them\u2014then we cannot be\nmistaken about them (infallibilism). \n\nGuala also argues (2016: ch. 14) that his monist\nrules-in-equilibrium approach can resolve normative disputes, such as\nthose in relation to same-sex marriage. On his unified account, he\nclaims, realism can be preserved, e.g. marriage does not depend\nnon-causally on our intentions, but yet same-sex marriage is\nallowable. In this connection Guala relies on the type/token\ndistinction and argues that while institution tokens solve particular\ncoordination problems, institution types are identified by their\nfunctions, e.g. same-sex unions fulfil the functions of marriage.\nHowever, the conservative view, e.g. of the Catholic Church, would\nsimply dispute that same-sex marriages do serve the same essential\nfunctions, e.g., the function of procreation. Moreover, this manoeuvre\ndoes not seem to address adequately the normative questions that now\narises at the level of functions. What function or functions ought\nmarriage serve? What moral constraints are there on specific social\narrangements that might otherwise serve those functions, e.g.\npolygamy? Here it is a background assumption that while the function\nor functions that an institution should have depends in part on the\nfunctions that it in fact has, one cannot simply read off the former\nfrom the latter. A corrupt police force might have the enrichment of\nmost of its officers as one of its de facto functions but it would not\nfollow from this that this was a legitimate function.\n\nMoreover, Guala\u2019s normative neutrality is open to question.\nGuala\u2019s rules-in-equilibrium account of institutions helps\nitself only to instrumental normativity (including the rationality of\ncompliance due to sanctions) and eschews moral considerations in\nfavour of the permissive notion of preference. The contrast here is\nwith the teleological account (section 4) which grounds institutions\non collective goods, especially aggregate human need, e.g. the need\nfor food (agricultural institutions), health (hospitals), education\n(schools), security (police services) etc. And, as David Wiggins has\nargued (1991) needs generate moral obligations. On\nGuala\u2019s view cooperative enterprises which undermine\ninstitutions, e.g. corrupt cliques, criminal organisations, can\nthemselves be institutions, as can somewhat trivial\nconvention-governed games, e.g. tic-tac-toe, hopscotch. \n\nMore generally, Guala\u2019s view seems to overstate the coordinating\nfunction of institutions and, as a result, conflate the underlying\nproblem solved by an institution with the surface problem that the\navailability of multiple solutions gives rise to, i.e. the problem of\ncoordinating on one of the available solutions. Thus the underlying\nproblem of avoiding traffic collisions is solved by all traffic\ntravelling in one direction keeping to one side of the road and all\ntraffic travelling in the opposite direction keeping to the opposite\nside. However, this solution now gives rise to a coordination problem\nsince there are two equally good solutions, i.e. all driving on the\nleft or all driving on the right. This point applies to other rational\nchoice coordination equilibria approaches, including Lewis\u2019\ninfluential theory of conventions (Miller 1986).\n",
