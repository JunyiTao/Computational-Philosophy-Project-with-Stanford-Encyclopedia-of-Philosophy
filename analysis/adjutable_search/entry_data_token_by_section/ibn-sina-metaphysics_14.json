    "main_text": "Causality and Cosmology || The Causal Relationship\n5.1 The Causal Relationship\n\nThe causal chain is the key idea of the argument by means of which\nAvicenna, in Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t VIII, 1\u20133, posits a\nFirst Cause, in accordance with\u2014at least partly\u2014a\ncosmological scheme. Indeed, according to some scholars, this is the\nonly place to track down a demonstration of the existence of the\nPrinciple in the Metaphysics of the Book of the\nHealing (Bertolacci 2007; De Haan 2016). As an Aristotelian,\nAvicenna establishes formal, material, efficient and final causes.\nConsequently, in order to demonstrate the existence of a First\nabsolute Principle, he must show not only that \u201cfor every causal\norder there is a first principle\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t,\nVIII, 1, 327, 9) but also that causal chains are all based on the same\nFirst Principle. The demonstration of the finiteness of the agent\ncauses, from which every other series derives is an exemplar and\nserves as a general proof. Avicenna deduces the finiteness of all\nseries (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 1, 329, 5\u20139) from\nthe finiteness of an unqualified causal series: thus all series refer\nto a First Principle that is both an agent (\u02bfilla\nf\u0101\u02bfiliyya) and a final or completive (\u02bfilla\ntam\u0101miyya) cause (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t VIII,\n1\u20133; Wisnovsky 2003a).\n\nThis argument has a general premise: \u201cthe cause of the existence\nof a thing exists along with it\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t,\nVI, 2, 1, 264\u2013265, 5; VIII, 1, 327, 11); its structure is taken\ndirectly, and almost verbatim, from Aristotle. The causal\nchain is composed\u2014as in Metaph., \u03b1, 2, 994 a\n1\u201319\u2014of three elements: the cause\n(al-\u02bfilla), and then the effect (or what is caused:\nal-ma\u02bfl\u016bl) and the intermediary or medium\n(al-mutawassi\u1e6d), which both have a\n\u201crelationship\u201d to the cause \u201cthat consists in being\ncaused\u201d (nisba ma\u02bfl\u016blyya; see\n section 4.1).\n In a nutshell, the argument is simple: the existence of an effect\n(which is the cause of nothing) cannot be explained without evoking a\nFirst Cause; a cause that is cause and effect at the same time and\ntherefore a medium, would in turn refer to a cause: therefore, no\nmatter how many intermediate terms it includes, the series must always\nimply an absolutely First Cause: a cause that is a cause for each\nelement of the series and exists together with them.\n\nDefining the series on the basis of three elements (each with its own\nproperty: \u1e2b\u0101\u1e63\u1e63iyya), allows Avicenna\nto include the possibility of a multiplicity of intermediate terms\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 1, 327, 12\u2013328, 3). In a\nseries, in fact, the first term\u2014the absolute cause\u2014has the\nproperty of being the cause of all that is other than itself; however\nthe middle term, which is a cause for one part of the series and an\neffect for the other, may repeat this relation in a multiplicity if\nnot in an infinity of elements (in an eternal succession of causal\nrelations); the effect that is simply caused, finally, has the\nproperty of being the cause of nothing. This proves to be the pattern\nof a causal series as such; and this is so not only because any series\nhas its own first principle, but also because every causal series and\nthen every causal relation finally refers to a Principle that provides\nits foundation by transcending it: every causal series implies a First\nabsolute cause by which each of its elements is caused\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 1, 328, 4\u2013329, 4). A causal\nchain without a primum is therefore impossible; if it is\nposited, this occurs \u201conly through language\u201d\n(bi-l-lis\u0101n; lingua tantum). The true causal\nseries (i.e., the causes that always exist along with their\neffects) are themselves always finite (on infinity, see McGinnis\n2010b).\n",
