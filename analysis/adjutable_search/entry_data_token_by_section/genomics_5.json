    "main_text": "Reading the Genome || Genome Size, the C-value Paradox and Junk DNA\n2.3 Genome Size, the C-value Paradox and Junk DNA\n\nIt has been known since the 1950s that genome size varies greatly\nbetween different organisms (Mirsky & Ris 1951; see also Gregory\n2001), but from the very beginning it was also clear that this\ndiversity has some surprising features. One of these features is the\nabsence of correlation between the complexity of an organism and the\nsize of its genome.\n2.3.1 The C-value Paradox\n\nAssuming an informational account of the genome one would expect that\nthe more complex an organism is, the more DNA its genome should\ncontain (this is in fact what many biologists assumed at least until\nabout the 1960s). How to define and assess the complexity of an\norganism is a tricky issue, but intuitively it seems reasonable to\nassume that a single-celled amoeba is less complex than an onion,\nwhich in turn is less complex than a large metazoan such as a human\nbeing, both in terms of the complexity of the workings and the\nstructure of the organism. The expectation was that the DNA content of\nhuman cells should be much larger than that of onions or amoebae. As\nit turns out, however, both the onion and the amoeba have much larger\ngenomes than human beings. The onion, for instance, has a genome of\nabout 16 billion base pairs, meaning it is about five times the size\nof the human genome (Gregory 2007). The same lack of\ncorrelation between genome size and complexity can be found in many\nother instances (for an overview of different genome sizes see the\nanimal genome size database in the\n Other Internet Resources section\n below).\n\nIt was also found early on that very similar species in the same genus\nshow large variation in genome size, despite having similar phenotypes\nand karyotypes (i.e., number and shape of chromosomes in a genome).\nWithin the family of buttercups, for instance, DNA content varied up\nto 80-fold (Rothfels et al. 1966). Also, Holm-Hansen (1969) showed\nthat species of unicellular algae display a 2000-fold difference in\nDNA content despite all being of similar developmental complexity. It\nwas findings such as these that gave a real urgency to addressing this\ndiscrepancy that was now labelled the C-value paradox (Thomas 1971).\nThe term \u2018C-value\u2019 refers to the constant\n(\u2018C\u2019) amount (\u2018value\u2019) of haploid DNA per\nnucleus and is measured in picograms of DNA per nucleus. The C-value\nis a measure of the amount of DNA each genome contains (we can see\nhere Winkler\u2019s original definition of the genome at work).\n2.3.2 Junk DNA\n\nThese discussions of genome sizes were closely related to concerns\nabout gene numbers. And this consideration of genome size vs. gene\nnumbers is what originally gave rise to the concept of \u2018junk\nDNA\u2019 (Ohno\n 1972).[11]\n The reasoning behind this concept was the following: if one assumes\na) that more complex organisms will have more DNA than less complex\norganisms and b) that gene numbers increase in proportion with genome\nsize, then the genome of the more complex organism should have more\ngenes than the less complex\n one.[12]\n Human cells, for instance, contain about 750x more DNA than E.\ncoli, meaning that they should turn out to have in the range of\n3.7 million genes, as E. coli has about 5000 genes. This is\nclearly not the case; even in the 1970s it was generally supposed that\nthe human genome might contain no more than 150,000 genes (Crollius et\nal. 2000). This discrepancy leads to the conclusion that the vast\nmajority of the DNA in our genome cannot be genes and is therefore\nwhat Ohno referred to as\n \u2018junk\u2019.[13]\n\nThe problem that the junk DNA discussion brings up has also been\nreferred to as the \u2018G-value paradox\u2019 (\u2018G\u2019\nstands for \u2018gene\u2019), which directly concerns the\ndiscrepancy between the number of genes in an organism and its\ncomplexity (Hahn & Wray 2002). This paradox has been reinforced by\nthe findings of the HGP. As Gregory (2005) and other commentators have\npointed out, the finding that the human genome contains many fewer\ngenes than expected was one of the most surprising outcomes of the\nHGP. Initial estimates from before the project were in the range of\n50,000 to 150,000. These were reduced to about 30,000\u201435,000\nafter the publication of the first sequence draft in 2001 and have now\nbeen further revised to the order of 20,000 (Gregory 2001).\n\nSome researchers assumed that the C-value paradox was fully resolved\nby the recognition that there is non-coding DNA in genomes (Gregory\n2001). Larger genome size in \u2018simpler\u2019 organisms merely\nmeans that they have large quantities of non-coding DNA. But as\nGregory points out, the fact that the majority of DNA in our genomes\nis non-coding might make the C-value discrepancies less of a paradox,\nbut it gives rise to a whole range of further puzzles (Where does this\nextra DNA come from? What is its function? Etc.), which is why he\nproposes to talk of the C-value as an enigma rather than a\nparadox (Gregory 2001). The C-value enigma consists of many different\nand layered problems and these require a pluralistic approach to\nanswering them, or so Gregory claims.\n\nThe publication of the draft genome sequence in 2001 and the\nconclusion of the HGP in 2003 did not give researchers all the tools\nand insights they needed to tackle these long-standing problems. But\nafter the HGP, building on the initial sequencing effort, researchers\ncould start to go beyond the mere sequence and gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the workings of the genome. This put them in a\nposition to tackle issues such as the significance of junk DNA and the\nC-value paradox more directly (or at least from a different angle).\nThe post-HGP phase is also characterized by an intense debate about\nthe best way of doing research: the question of whether biological\nresearch should best be done on a small or a large scale has come up\nagain and again in the post-HGP era, especially with the rise of other\npost-HGP large scale projects. The next section will address two\nprojects/research fields that symbolize the various efforts and\naspirations that were characteristic of the post-HGP era and which\nwill help to illuminate some of the philosophical issues these\ndevelopments raised. \n",
