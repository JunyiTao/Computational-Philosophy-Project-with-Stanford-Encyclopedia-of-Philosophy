    "main_text": "\n\nExperimental philosophy is an interdisciplinary approach that brings\ntogether ideas from what had previously been regarded as distinct\nfields. Specifically, research in experimental philosophy brings\ntogether two key elements:\n\nthe kinds of questions and theoretical frameworks traditionally\nassociated with philosophy;\nthe kinds of experimental methods traditionally associated with\npsychology and cognitive science.\n\n\nThough experimental philosophy is united by this broad approach, there\nis a diverse range of projects in experimental philosophy. Some use\nexperimental evidence to support a \u201cnegative program\u201d\nthat challenges more traditional methods in analytic philosophy,\nothers use experimental data to support positive claims about\ntraditional questions, and still others explore questions about how\npeople ordinarily think and feel insofar as these questions are\nimportant in themselves.\n\nThis entry provides a brief introduction to the core aims of\ncontemporary experimental philosophy. It then reviews recent\nexperimental work on the negative program, free will, moral judgment\nand epistemology. We conclude with a discussion of major objections to\nthe field of experimental philosophy as a whole. \n",
