    "main_text": "Daoist Medical Traditions and Physicians || Sun Simiao\n3.3 Sun Simiao\n\n\nSun Simiao \u5b6b\u601d\u9088 (581\u2013682) was the author\nof two major works on medical practice and a work on Daoist\nlongevity prescriptions. He has been worshiped as the\n\u201cMedicine Buddha,\u201d and as the \u201cKing of Medicine\u201d (yao\nwang). Sun is said to have taken up medicine to strengthen\nhis own health after childhood illnesses. He also treated\nrelatives and neighbors, and practiced medicine near the Tang capital\nof Chang\u2019an. He also traveled widely to learn new prescription recipes.\nAfter completing his first book, he lived in seclusion on Mt. Wubai\n(Wubai shan, later known, after him, as Yao wang Shan), where\nhe followed Daoist principles. He refused several official positions at\nthe Sui and Tang courts, preferring to treat ordinary people in the\ncountryside.\n\n\nHis biography (in both of the two Standard Histories of the Tang\nDynasty, trans. Sivin 1968, 81\u2013144) emphasizes his interests in\nphilosophy, noting his particular study of the Yi jing,\nDaode jing, works concerned with yin-yang theory, and shu\nshu numerical calculations. His work reflected these\ninterests in yin-yang and wuxing theory and\nmacrocosm-microcosm correspondences between the body and cosmos. \nHe is also the first Chinese physician to write extensively on medical\nethics.\n\n\nSun Simiao is the author of two major medical works.\nPrescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold (Qian jin fang\n\u5343\u91d1\u65b9, printed in 652 CE) was a comprehensive\ntreatise on the practice of medicine in thirty chapters. It contained\nherbal remedies and reviewed the history of medicine since the Han\nDynasty, starting with the Huang Di neijing.\n\n\nThe introduction to the Qianjin fang (ch. 1) describes the\ncharacteristics of a great physician and describes inappropriate\nconduct, especially the desire for wealth or reputation. \nAccording to Sun, a great physician should not pay attention to status,\nwealth or age; he should not care whether a person is attractive, a\nfriend or enemy, or whether the person is (Han) Chinese or educated. He\nshould meet everyone on equal grounds and should always act as if he\nwere thinking of a\nclose\nrelative\n(ch.1. For translation see Unschuld 1979, 29\u201333).\n\n\nThe Qian jin fang also includes chapters on diet (ch. 26),\nnurturing life (yang xing, ch. 27), pulse diagnosis (ch. 28),\nacumoxa (chs. 29\u201330, the combination of acupuncture and moxibustion),\nmassage, and exercise. His interests also included the treatment\nof women (ch. 2\u20134) and children (ch. 5). May chapters are concerned\nwith herbal recipes. Sun Simiao emphasized that the effectiveness\nof herbal recipes depended on correct identification and preparation,\nincluding gathering herbs at the right time and drying them\ncorrectly. His formulas came from both famous physicians of the\npast and his own contemporaries, including minorities and foreigners.\nHe also edited formulas to eliminate non-essential\ningredients. \n\n\nThe second book is a supplement to the first. The supplement\n(Qian jin yi fang \u5343\u91d1\u7ffc\u65b9,\nprinted in 682) records some thirty years of Sun\u2019s own experience with\nspecial attention to folk remedies. It adds some eight hundred\nrecipes, with details on collection and preparation for two\nhundred. Some are new herbs, including herbs from India. It also\nrefers to many mystical and magical practices, including exorcisms,\ntalismans, incantations and descriptions of acumoxa points effective\nagainst demons.\n\n\nSun was also the author of several works on Daoist alchemy, which he\nis believed to have practiced (he died at the age of 101). These\ninclude the Essential Instructions from the Scripture of the Elixirs of\nGreat Clarity (Taiqing Danjing Yaojue, ca. 640), an anthology\nof some thirty selected methods (Sivin 1968, 262\u2013264). His\n\u201cEssay on Preserving and Nourishing Life\u201d (Sheyang\nlun \u651d\u990a\u8ad6) gives monthly advice on food,\nsleeping habits and action of good and ill auspice (Predagio 2013,928).\n\n\nIn summary, Sun Simiao, like Ge Hong and Tao Honjing combines\nexplicit interests in Daoist philosophy, medicine, materia medica and\nalchemy. These physicians were informed by the yin-yang\ntheory and cosmology of the Yi jing and the philosophical\nconcepts of the Zhuangzi and Daode jing.  But,\ndespite their strong philosophical interests, the major contributions\nof their writings lie in the areas of medicine, pharmacology and\nalchemy.\n",
