    "main_text": "Philosophy || Moral Philosophy\n3.1 Moral Philosophy\n\nVirtue theory constitutes the primary object of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s\nmoral philosophy. Many of her dialogues analyze the moral virtues and\nvices typical of the aristocratic world of the salon and the court. In\nexamining these virtues, the dialogues emphasize the distinctive ways\nin which women possess these moral qualities. The dialogues also\nstress the ambiguity of virtue. Using the distinguo [a\nrefined distinction between similar qualities], Scud\u00e9ry\nhighlights the multiple gradations of a single virtue and how certain\nmoral dispositions can function as either virtues or vices according\nto context.\n\nThe aristocratic bent of Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s virtue theory appears\nin her treatment of three moral virtues: magnanimity, politeness, and\ndiscretion. Each of the virtues presupposes a certain amount of\nculture, affluence, and social rank. Magnanimity requires a rational\nestimate of one\u2019s proper worth and an acute estimation of\none\u2019s rank within the social hierarchy. \n\n\nTrue magnanimity as I consider it is a good opinion of oneself,\nfounded on reason and on the solid merit of one who aspires to great\nthings and contemns the petty. One cannot be truly magnanimous if one\ndoes not esteem oneself as much as is proper in comparison to things\nbeneath oneself. [CN, 1: 70] \n\n\nIn Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s neo-Aristotelian version of the virtue,\nmagnanimity encompasses ambition, self-esteem, and pride in social\nposition. At the same time, magnanimity must avoid contempt for the\nmysterious workings of fate or divine providence, since such\noverweening pride leads to self-destruction.\n\nThe dialogue Of Politeness conceives politeness primarily as\nthe capacity to engage in proper conversation with persons of elevated\nsocial rank. \n\n\nTrue politeness consists in knowing how to live properly and always\nknowing how to speak properly\u2026.It is the avoidance of any\nrudeness or injury to anyone. It is not saying to others what you\nwould not want them to say to you. It is wanting not to be the tyrant\nof conversation by always speaking without letting others speak.\n[CN, 1: 127] \n\n\nPoliteness entails more than proper etiquette in speech; it must be\nmotivated by a genuine charity toward the neighbor, rooted in the\ngolden rule of reciprocity.\n\nDiscretion is a virtue particularly prized at the court. Of\nDiscretion explains how this virtue is diversely expressed\naccording to one\u2019s position in the social hierarchy. \n\n\nConcerning our superiors, we do not exercise discretion; rather, we\nexpress respect. Concerning our inferiors, we do not exercise\ndiscretion; rather, we exercise goodness and indulgence, especially\nwhen we abstain from doing something pleasing to us but displeasing to\nthem. [MM, 2: 613] \n\n\nJust as gossip damages court society, the discretion of the courtier\nstrengthens it. The variations on the exercise of discretion reflect\nthe stratification of the aristocratic society for which\nScud\u00e9ry writes.\n\nIn many dialogues Scud\u00e9ry insists that women as well as men can\npossess the full range of moral virtues. Against those who hold that\nonly men can practice magnanimity because of its public and political\nnature, Scud\u00e9ry argues that women also can possess the virtue.\n\u201cThis great quality [magnanimity] is not banned from appearing\nin certain extraordinary women\u201d [CN, 1: 64]. As an\nexample, the dialogue cites Portia, wife of Brutus. Although both\nsexes can possess the most rarified moral virtues, each sex tends to\npractice the virtues in a distinctive way. The virtue of kindness is\nmore imperative in the personality of a woman than in that of a man.\n\n\n\nKindness is the most essential quality for women. It reinforces the\ncharm of their beauty and of their mind. In fact, kindness is so\nnecessary for them that they cannot be admirable without possessing it\nin an eminent degree. [CN, 1: 233]\n\n\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s treatment of the virtue of glory also insists\nthat women are not excluded from its practice. Of Glory\nrejects the thesis that glory is preeminently a military virtue and,\nconsequently, that it can only be acquired by men. The dialogue\ninsists that women can manifest glory by intellectual and moral\nachievement. \n\n\nLadies have glory when their mind exceeds their beauty and when they\nhave so much moral merit that one can still love them when they have\nlost everything that made them physically beautiful. [CN, 2:\n563] \n\n\nParalleling the military glory of men, women often manifest glory\nthrough the romantic wars they wage. Poetic descriptions of romance\nrightly use martial language to describe its operations. \u201cLove\nalso has its combats, victories, conquests, chains, irons, crowns,\nslaves, prisons, prisoners, defeats and triumphs\u201d [CN,\n2: 577]. In fact, glory is present in the emergence of any moral\nvirtue, whether applauded by an external public or not. \u201cGlory\nis something which necessarily arises from any act of virtue just as\nlight necessarily arises from the sun which produces it\u201d\n[CN, 2: 571\u201372]. In particular, glory accompanies the\nmoral victory over oneself through the conquest of one\u2019s\npassions.\n\nNotwithstanding the authentic moral value possessed by the natural\nvirtues of classical antiquity, Christianity has elevated the natural\nvalues through the work of grace. Modesty is exemplary. The properly\nChristian virtue of humility has refined the generic virtue of\nmodesty. \n\n\nThe word humility is a Christian term, because this virtue,\nlike all the others, has been better known since the rise of\nChristianity than it was among the pagans\u2026.In Christian\nhumility, Christians know their weaknesses and faults through the\nprecepts of divine law. Developing a genuine remorse for not having\naccomplished it, they hate themselves and only themselves. They cannot\nfeel the same way about the burden of the faults of others.\n[EM, 1: 14] \n\n\nAlthough Scud\u00e9ry evinces little interest in the properly\ntheological virtues of faith, hope, and charity, she repeatedly\nemphasizes the purifying role of grace in the transition from pagan to\ncontemporary Christian exercises of virtue.\n\nJust as the moral virtues bear an aristocratic cast in\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s works, the moral vices carry a distinctive\naristocratic stamp. The dialogues criticize vices which commonly\nappear in a court setting: flattery, dissimulation, mockery, envy, and\nvanity. In their sophistication, the vices of the courtier are\nfrequently hidden beneath the appearance of virtue. Of Hope\nanalyzes how the ambition of the courtier distorts the Christian\nvirtue of hope. \n\n\nThe entire life of the court is nothing but hope; that is where one\nalways dies in hoping for something. In every court in which\nI\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve seen courtiers puffed up with vain hopes,\nwhich at the end turned into bitter disappointments. [MM, 1: 36]\n\n\n\nThe vices criticized in the dialogues often represent a species of\nmendacity. Assaults on the order of truth, essential for the cohesion\nof society itself, constitute particularly grave moral transgressions\nin Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s hierarchy of values.\n\nIn Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s analysis, many virtues are capable of minute\nvariations in quality and operation. Of Kindness details\nnumerous subspecies of the virtue of kindness, such as habitual,\nrespectful, friendly, courtly, urbane, vivacious, eloquent, true, and\nfalse. In fact, kindness admits of so many variations that it can turn\ninto a vice in certain contexts. \n\n\nKindness, which is a peaceful and pleasant virtue, one necessary for\nsociety and rightly admired, becomes a vice if it lacks certain\nlimits. This virtue is different from others. There is only one sort\nof justice and there is only sort of generosity and of wisdom;\nhowever, there are a hundred sorts of kindnesses. [CDS, 1: 320]\n\n\n\nKindness is not alone in the moral ambiguity of certain virtues.\nOf Anger ends on a note of irresolution concerning the\nvicious nature of anger. While the dialogue\u2019s interlocutors\nagree that anger is usually a serious vice, especially when the moral\nagent deliberately prolongs it, they cannot rule out the possibility\nthat certain angers might be justified under the category of justified\nretribution.\n\nDespite the ambiguous moral status of certain virtues and vices,\nScud\u00e9ry rejects moral relativism. In several dialogues she\nargues that certain actions are patently evil, no matter how popular\nthey are in particular cultures or governments. Of Lying\nrejects the use of deception or murder to advance the interests of the\nstate. No raison d\u2019\u00e9tat can justify the use of\nimmoral means, even to justify a substantial national good. \u201cIn\norder for an action to be heroic, it is not only necessary that the\nmotive be just; it is necessary that its methods be noble and\ninnocent\u201d [CN, 1: 443]. Despite widespread social\napproval, certain customs are intrinsically immoral. Although modern\nEuropean voyagers have revealed the widespread acceptance of polygamy,\nfor example, the practice is censured by Scud\u00e9ry as oppressive.\n\n\n\nNeither nature nor reason could have authorized this custom. It is\nonly the tyranny of custom authorized by a grave voluptuousness that\nhas authorized this multiplicity of wives and the imprisonment of the\nSultan\u2019s consorts in the Seraglio. [MM, 1: 271] \n\n\nThe moral ambiguity of certain virtues should not lead to the\nacceptance of immoral practices which are only abuses of power\nsanctified by custom. Irrational customs which oppress women, such as\npolygamy and foot-binding in China, merit Scud\u00e9y\u2019s\nparticular scorn. \n",
