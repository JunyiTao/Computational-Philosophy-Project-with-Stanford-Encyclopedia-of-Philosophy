Analytic Feminism: Limitations and Challenges\n\nAlthough traditional analytic philosophy seemed to many to be the\nleast hospitable philosophical method for feminism, analytic\nfeminists\u2019 work over the decades has greatly increased the\nmethod\u2019s hospitality and showed its promise. Let\u2019s now\nconsider some limitations and challenges that remain for analytic\nfeminism.\n\nThe strengths and limitations of various kinds of feminist\nphilosophies can grow from the same sources\u2014if feminists are\nclose to a mainstream tradition, they are subject to at least some of\nits limitations although they stand a better chance of influencing it\nand \u201cbuilding bridges\u201d than do those who critique the\ntradition more deeply. Audre Lorde, addressing the racism and\nheterosexism of a feminist conference in 1979, pointed to one risk\nquite powerfully by saying, \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never\ndismantle the master\u2019s house\u201d (Lorde 1984: 112). Although\nover the decades Lorde\u2019s claim sent chills down the spines of\nfeminists across the disciplines, the very existence of feminist\nphilosophy requires that neither the \u201ctools\u201d of the\nphilosophical trade nor the house(s) are the sole property of the\n\u201cmaster\u201d. Feminist philosophers, analytic or not, build on\nthe work not only of other feminists and other scholars doing engaged\nwork, but also of some traditional philosophers\nsometimes. Because of the desire to utilize as well as modify\ntraditional philosophy, feminists must always be alert for deeper\nlevels of male or other kinds of bias that may become apparent in\ntheir work\u2014possible unwanted baggage of traditional analytic\nphilosophy.\n\nSome potentially relevant \u201cbaggage\u201d for analytic feminists\ninclude the deeper limitations of their concepts and methods and the\nlevel of abstraction at which they tend to work. For example, when any\nof these contribute to an inability to notice and center diverse\nexperiences, analytic feminists do not attend to a full range of\ncomplex human lives that they hope to encompass; the impact and\nmeaning of race/ethnicity, social class, religion, nationality, queer\nand trans lives, lives of people with disabilities, and others will be\nlost. Examples of such limitations as well as others are below.\n\nKristie Dotson, while praising Fricker\u2019s (2007) strong\ncontribution to understanding epistemic injustice, argues that\nFricker\u2019s lack of an \u201copen conceptual structure\u201d\nabout what constitutes epistemic injustice leads her work to\nperpetuate epistemic injustice. This has happened, Dotson argues,\nbecause Fricker contrasts epistemic injustice with epistemic bad luck\n(Dotson 2012: 25). Dotson explores epistemic oppression in more\nexpansive ways that speak more directly to the different levels of\nsystemic oppression and that encompass various important forms of\nepistemic exclusion and violence, including, for example, silencing\nand smothering (2011, 2012, 2014).\nNaomi Scheman and Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff point out ways in\nwhich analytic feminists may not fully appreciate all the political,\nmetaphysical and epistemological baggage that has already been packed\ninto their theories and concepts. Scheman thinks that Nussbaum stops\nlistening too soon to attacks on rationality and fails to appreciate\nthat openness to reasonable argument (advocated by Nussbaum) implies\nthat we recognize when our own conception of reasonableness is being\nquestioned (Scheman 2001b). Alcoff, maintaining that we need\nsome concept of reason, makes a similar argument against\nNussbaum and points out the dogmatic character of claiming that some\nparticular concept of reason is the concept that\ncannot be given up (Alcoff 1995).\n\n\nA closely related objection is that it is not always easy or even\npossible to detach one\u2019s method from one\u2019s politics.\nBecause some analytic feminist work is liberal, for example, Nussbaum\n(2000a), Cudd (2006), and Bhandary (2020), other analytic feminists\ntake pains to separate their method from their politics. Antony argues\nthat her own socialist politics are compatible with an analytic method\n(2003). Although one can appreciate Antony\u2019s point, if an\nanalytic feminist is articulating a socialist feminism,\nrather than favoring some kind of socialism or other, then the facets\nof her position derived ultimately from Marx, from Quine, and from\nfeminism need to be hammered out carefully in order to settle down\ntogether well.\n\nOthers raise more general questions about the relation between\nphilosophical method and feminist and anti-racist politics. For\nexample, Alice Crary, taking on the general relation between\nphilosophical method and feminist politics, finds that Fricker\u2019s\nneutral philosophical methods and concepts of reason (2007) are not\nsufficiently radical to support feminist politics (2018). Tina\nFernandes Botts (2018) and Jana Cattien (2019) both criticize analytic\nfeminists\u2019 highly abstract level of analyzing race and gender as\nwell as their use of similar models for both. Instead, specific lived\nexperiences of marginalized people need to figure more centrally in\nour thinking (Botts 2018). Cattien argues that what is at stake\npolitically is obscured by analytic feminist metaphysicians (including\ntheir normative assumptions) and that they need \u201cto be able to\ntake themselves as objects of a politically charged critique\u201d\n(2019: 733). For example, she finds Haslanger\u2019s (2012) analysis\nthat places all races on one conceptual plane can\u2019t do justice\nto \u201cwhite complicities in perpetuating racist power\nrelations\u201d (2019: 720). \n\n\nClusters of separate objections focus around subjectivity and\nstandpoints. Traditional analytic philosophy has been rightly\ncriticized for its inability to handle subjectivity. In thinking about\nwhether this criticism applies to analytic feminists as well,\nlet\u2019s consider it in the context of knowledge. Elizabeth\nAnderson calls the position that knowledge is \u201csituated\u201d\nthe fundamental point of feminist epistemology (see\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science).\n Can \u201csituated\u201d knowledge as developed by analytic\nfeminists capture both the individual subjectivity of human beings and\nthe ways in which material conditions and complex social institutions\nstructure the standpoints of women and others in marginalized groups?\nThere are obviously two separate questions here\u2014asked together\nbecause they focus on whether analytic feminism has the resources to\ncapture what is very important to other feminist methodological\ntraditions: standpoint theory, psychoanalysis, and\npoststructuralism.\n\nConsider Longino as an example: she is dealing with situated knowledge\nin the context of the sciences. Her contextual empiricism and her more\nrecent argument to dissolve completely the rational/social dichotomy\nand the dichotomies that underlie it allow her to delve into the right\nareas. Of course, science is not all of life or knowledge, so her\nargument would need to be extended into areas of everyday life that\nCode, among others, has discussed. Whatever the limitations of\ncontextual empiricism, it is better at analyzing the structural and\nmaterial features that construct subjectivity than it is at\nilluminating individual subjectivity. It is in the latter area that\npoststructuralist and psychoanalytic approaches flourish (see, for\nexample, Butler 1990; Butler & Salih 2003; Irigaray\n1991;\u00a0Whitford 1991; Kristeva & Oliver 2002). Their focus on\nthe opaque, fragmented, or unfinished character of human subjectivity\nmay be a bit untidy for many analytic feminists. But given the\nimportance of this topic for feminist philosophy, there is a need for\nfruitful dialogue about it. \n\n\nFeminist standpoint theory, drawing originally from Marxist theory,\nraised a cluster of questions for analytic feminists: whether they can\nexplain the political/material construction of standpoints in the\nproduction of knowledge, how they treat community-wide biases and\nassumptions, what criteria they use to distinguish \u201cgood\u201d\nand \u201cbad\u201d biases, and so on. Harding advocates a\npluralistic form of standpoint theory that focuses on the importance\nof starting research from the lives of marginalized people (1991).\nDoing so has many advantages, including an increased likelihood that\nwe will be able to uncover community-wide biases and assumptions of\nthe privileged as we produce knowledge in a number of fields. Although\ninitially analytic feminist empiricists and standpoint theorists saw\neach other as embodying rival traditions and were often critical of\neach other, analytic feminist empiricists then developed significant\ninterest in looking at the resources offered by standpoint theory as\nwell as pursuing common themes or consensus in the two kinds of\napproaches (see, for example, Wylie 2004; Potter 2006; Crasnow 2008;\nIntemann 2010, 2016; Anderson 2020; and a 2009 Hypatia\nsymposium that includes Crasnow, Harding, Rouse, Kourany, Rolin, and\nSolomon, all 2009). A range of possibilities include\n\nincorporating the insights of standpoint theory into empirical\n(and empiricist) work (Wylie 2004),\nmaintaining that in a number of their forms they are compatible\n(Anderson 2020), or\narguing that feminist empiricism and standpoint theory have\nsignificant overlaps but that their remaining differences show that\nthey need each other (Intemann 2010).\n\n\nFuller discussion of these issues can be found in Intemann (2010,\n2016), Anderson (2020), and entries on\n feminist social epistemology\u00a0and\n feminist perspectives on science. \n\n\nRelated objections arise concerning naturalized epistemology. As\nmentioned above, feminist social epistemology is the most typical form\nof naturalized feminist epistemology today. Social epistemologists\nhave deep critiques of individually oriented and\n\u201cscientistic\u201d analytic naturalized epistemology. In\naddition to feminists already discussed above, Code and Phyllis Rooney\nhave both argued that there is tension between typical naturalized\nepistemology and feminist epistemology; Rooney calls it an\n\u201cuneasy alliance\u201d (Rooney 2003). Code offers an ecological\nmodel that she maintains is preferable to analytically and\nindividualistically oriented naturalism (1996, 2006). Rooney appeals\nto psychological studies of gender and cognition to provide evidence\nfor her critique of assumptions of empirical studies (and of the\nepistemology that structures and then uses the empirical results). For\nexample, Rooney wants to critique the assumption of the stability of\nthe individual/social distinction, the stability of gender\u2014or\neven that gender is either stable or situational, for there might be\nmore choices (Rooney 2003). Although analytic feminist naturalized\nepistemologists might well agree with much of Rooney\u2019s critique,\nCode\u2019s 2006 ecological model would be a nearly impossible\nstretch. In any case, analytic feminists must be very careful as they\nchoose their own models to reflect upon the kinds of assumptions to\nwhich they acquiesce, whether those just mentioned or others that\nmight go under the label \u201cscientism\u201d. \n\n\nThe final cluster of challenges concerns language, images, and\n\u201crhetorical space\u201d. These challenges are meant to call\nattention to other kinds of \u201cbaggage\u201d of which analytic\nfeminists need to be aware. Although both feminist and nonfeminist\nanalytic philosophers are thought to favor literal uses of language,\nthey also rely on metaphors, analogies, images and the like in the\ncourse of making their philosophical cases (think of the frequency of\nNeurath\u2019s ship via Quine). Analytic feminists need to give\nattention to the assumptions and implications of their literal uses of\nlanguage, their images and how they relate to what Lorraine Code calls\nthe \u201crhetorical spaces\u201d in which they function (or, in\nother cases, fail to function). In using \u201crhetorical\nspaces\u201d Code is thinking of the ways in which our discourses are\nstructured to limit what can count as meaningful, be taken seriously,\nyield insight, expect uptake, and so on (1995: ix\u2013x; with\ncontinued discussion in Code 2006).\n\nMarguerite La Caze, using methodology developed by Mich\u00e8le Le\nD\u0153uff, argues that both feminist and nonfeminist analytic\nphilosophers use images that can unwittingly perpetuate images that\nexclude women\u2014think of mythical social contracts in political\nphilosophy and visual and spatial metaphors about knowledge (La Caze\n2002, Le D\u0153uff 1980 [1989]; see also Gatens 1991). Analytic\nfeminists are being called upon to widen the rhetorical spaces in\nanalytic philosophy as well as to recognize and scrutinize the images\nthat they, in fact, use in the course of their allegedly literal\nspeech. \n\n\nMost analytic feminists welcome challenges to their positions from\nother feminists of any background. For, after all, there is no easier\nway to be kept honest and to recognize one\u2019s own collusion with\nmale or other biases in philosophy than to have feminist colleagues\npoint it out. It is part of any reasonable feminism to want to remain\nopen to the ongoing possibility of collusion and self-deception.\nCandid, fair-minded conversation benefits all forms of feminism.\n",
