To show that records in typical branches exhibit the\nstandard quantum statistics he needed a typicality measure over\nbranches, something that is not given by pure wave mechanics itself.\nAs he put the point, \u201cIn order to make quantitative statements\nabout the relative frequencies of the different possible results of\nobservation which are recorded in the memory of a typical observer we\nmust have a method of selecting a typical observer\u201d\n(1956, 124).\n\nEverett introduced his typicality measure by imposing a sequence of\nformal constraints until a measure was uniquely determined. In\nparticular, he required that the typicality measure \\(m\\) (1) satisfy\nthe standard axioms for being a probability measure, (2) be a positive\nfunction of the complex-valued coefficients associated with the\nbranches of the superposition, and (3) satisfy a sub-branch additivity\ncondition to ensure that the sum of the measures on branches are equal\nto the measure on the initial ancestor branch before branching.\nTogether, he took these constraints to determine \\(m\\) to be the\nnorm-squared-amplitude measure over branches. See Everett (1956,\n123\u20138) and (1957, 188\u201393) and Barrett and Byrne (2012,\n274\u20135) for his description of his typicality measure, how he\njustified it, and how he intended for it to work in his account of\nquantum statistics.\n\nConsider state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) above. Here \\(m\\) assigns measure\n1/2 to the first branch and measure 1/2 to the second branch. While\n\\(m\\) assigns a measure to each branch equal to the probability that\nwould be assigned to the corresponding outcome on the standard\ncollapse theory, \\(m\\) is a typically measure and hence says\nnothing whatsoever regarding the probability of the\nalternative measurement outcomes. Indeed, inasmuch as he took all\nbranches to be equally actual, Everett took the probability associated\nwith each branch to be one. While the typicality measure is across\nbranches, the subjective appearance of quantum probabilities was\nto be explained by the sequence of records within a typical\nbranch.\n\nThe setup for Everett\u2019s argument went as follows. Consider a\nmeasuring device M that is ready to make and record an infinite series\nof measurements on each of an infinite series of systems \\(S_k\\) each\nin state: \n\\[\\alpha |\\!\\uparrow_x\\rangle_{S_k} + \\beta\n|\\!\\downarrow_x\\rangle_{S_k}.\\]\n\n\nSuppose that M interacts with each system in turn and perfectly\ncorrelates its \\(k\\)th memory register with the \\(x\\)-spin of system\n\\(S_k\\) by the linear dynamics. This will produce an increasingly\ncomplicated entangled superposition of different sequences of\nmeasurement outcomes. After one measurement, the state of M and\n\\(S_1\\) will be: \n\n\\[\\alpha |\\ldquo{\\uparrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\uparrow\\rangle_{S_1} +\n\\beta |\\ldquo{\\downarrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\downarrow\\rangle_{S_1}.\\]\n\n\nAfter two measurements, the state of M, \\(S_1\\), and \\(S_2\\) will\nbe \n\\[\\begin{aligned} \n\\alpha^2 |\\ldquo{\\uparrow\\uparrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\uparrow\\rangle_{S_1} |\\!\\uparrow\\rangle_{S_2} &+ \\alpha\\beta |\\ldquo{\\uparrow\\downarrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\uparrow\\rangle_{S_1} |\\!\\downarrow\\rangle_{S_2} \\\\ &+ \\beta\\alpha |\\ldquo{\\downarrow\\uparrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\downarrow\\rangle_{S_1} |\\!\\uparrow\\rangle_{S_2} + \\beta^2 |\\ldquo{\\downarrow\\downarrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\downarrow\\rangle_{S_1} |\\!\\downarrow_x\\rangle_{S_2}. \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nHere there are four branches, and again the typically measure for each\nbranch is the norm-squared of the associated amplitude. After \\(k\\)\nmeasurements in the present case there will be \\(2^k\\) terms\nrepresenting all possible sequences of records.\n\nWithin this framework, Everett argued that in the limit as the number\nof measurements gets large, almost all branches in measure \\(m\\) will\ndescribe sequences of measurement records that are randomly\ndistributed with the standard quantum statistics. While he just\nsketched the corresponding results, one can show that:\nRelative Frequency: For any \\(\\delta>0\\) and\n\\(\\epsilon>0\\), there exists a \\(k\\) such that after \\(k\\)\nmeasurements the sum of the norm-squared of the amplitude associated\nwith each branch where the distribution of spin-up results is within\n\\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(|\\alpha|^2\\) and the distribution of spin-down\nresults is within \\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(|\\beta|^2\\) is within \\(\\delta\\)\nof one.\n\n\nand\n\nRandomness: The sum of the norm-squared of the\namplitude associated with each branch where the sequence of relative\nrecords satisfies any standard criterion for being random goes to one\nas the number of measurements gets large. This result holds for any\ncriterion of randomness that classifies at most a countable number of\n\\(\\omega\\)-length binary sequences as nonrandom.\n\nSee Hartle (1968), Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann (1989), Barrett\n(1999), and Barrett and Goldbring (2022) for proofs of the first\nlimiting result and the last two references for proofs of the\nsecond.\n\nIt is an immediate consequence that the records of a typical relative\nobserver, in the special measure \\(m\\) sense of typical, will exhibit\nthe standard quantum statistics as the number of measurements gets\nlarge. As Everett put it:\n\nIn the language of subjective experience, the observer which is\ndescribed by a typical element \u2026 of the superposition has perceived\nan apparently random sequence of definite results for the\nobservations.\u2026 It will thus appear to the observer which is\ndescribed by a typical element of the superposition that each initial\nobservation on a system caused the system to \u201cjump\u201c into\nan eigenstate in a random fashion and thereafter remain there for\nsubsequent measurements on the same system. Therefore, qualitatively,\nat least, the probabilistic assertions of Process 1 [the collapse of\nthe state under rule 4b] appear to be valid to the observer\ndescribed by a typical element of the final superposition. (1956, 123)\n\n\nMore generally, he concluded that \u201cthe memory sequence of a\ntypical element of [the superposition] has all the characteristics of\na random sequence, with individual, independent \u2026\nprobabilities\u201c (1956, 127). Hence, a typical sequence of\nrelative measurement records will exhibit the standard quantum\nstatistics and thus appear to have been produced by Process 1 (rule\n4b). And that is Everett\u2019s full deduction of quantum\nprobabilities as subjective appearances to a typical relative\nobserver.\n\nEverett was careful to explain that the typicality measure over\nbranches involved no reference to probability (1956, 79). While he\nsometimes used the language of probability theory, he explained that\nthis was only for ease of exposition, and he repeatedly instructed the\nreader that all talk of probabilities should be translated back to\ntalk of typicalities (1956, 127 and 1957, 193). That he did not aim to\ndeduce probabilities over branches corresponding to alternative\nmeasurement outcomes is something that distinguishes Everett\u2019s\napproach from most other formulations of quantum mechanics, including\nthose of many Everettians.\n\nWhy showing that a typical sequence of relative measurement records\nwill exhibit the standard quantum statistics is supposed to be enough\nto explain our experience turns on Everett\u2019s understanding of\nempirical faithfulness.\n",
