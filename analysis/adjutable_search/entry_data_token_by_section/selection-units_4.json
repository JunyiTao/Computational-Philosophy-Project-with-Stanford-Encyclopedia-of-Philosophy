    "main_text": "Four Basic Questions || The Beneficiary Question\n2.3 The Beneficiary Question\n\nWho benefits from a process of evolution by selection? There are two\npredominant interpretations of this question: Who benefits ultimately\nin the long term, from the evolution by selection process? And who\ngets the benefit of possessing adaptations as a result of a selection\nprocess? Take the first of these, the issue of the ultimate\nbeneficiary.\n\nThere are two obvious answers to this question\u2014two different\nways of characterizing the long-term survivors and beneficiaries of\nthe evolution by selection process. One might say that the species or\nlineages (the previous \u201cevolvers\u201d) are the ultimate\nbeneficiaries of the evolutionary process. Alternatively, one might\nsay that the lineages characterized on the genic level, that is, the\nsurviving alleles, are the relevant long-term beneficiaries. I have\nnot located any authors holding the first view, but, for Richard\nDawkins, the latter interpretation is the primary fact about\nevolution. To arrive at this conclusion, he adds the requirement of\nagency to the notion of beneficiary (see Hampe & Morgan 1988). A\nbeneficiary, by definition, does not simply passively accrue credit in\nthe long term; it must function as the initiator of a causal pathway\n(Dawkins 1982a,b). Under this\ndefinition, the replicator is causally responsible for all of the\nvarious effects that arise further down the biochemical or phenotypic\npathway, irrespective of which entities might reap the long-term\nrewards (Sapienza 2010).\n\nA second and quite distinct version of the beneficiary question\ninvolves the notion of adaptation. The evolution by selection process\nmay be said to \u201cbenefit\u201d a particular level of entity\nunder selection, through producing adaptations at that level (Williams\n1966, Maynard Smith 1976, Eldredge 1985, Vrba 1984). On this approach,\nthe level of entity actively selected (the interactor) benefits from\nevolution by selection at that level through its acquisition of\nadaptations.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish the question concerning the level at\nwhich adaptations evolve from the question about the identity of the\nultimate beneficiaries of that selection process. One can think that\norganisms have adaptations without thinking that organisms are the\n\u201cultimate beneficiaries\u201d of the selection\n process.[6]\n This sense of \u201cbeneficiary\u201d that concerns adaptations\nwill be treated as a separate issue, discussed in the next\nsection.\n",
