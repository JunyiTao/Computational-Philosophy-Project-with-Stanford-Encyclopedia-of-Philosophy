    "main_text": "Mencius and His Philosophical Opponents\n5. Later Influence and Interpretations\n\nIn his own era, Mencius\u2019s views were criticized by the Daoist\nZhuangzi and by his fellow Confucian Xunzi. Zhuangzi never refers to\nMencius by name, but several passages seem to clearly be directed at\nhim. In a passage that argues against the possibility of objective\nethical knowledge, Zhuangzi states, \u201cFrom where I see it, the\nsprouts of benevolence and righteousness and the pathways of right and\nwrong are all snarled and jumbled\u201d (Zhuangzi 2; Ivanhoe\nand Van Norden 2005, 222). The phrase \u201csprouts of benevolence\nand righteousness\u201d (r\u00e9n y\u00ec zh\u012b\ndu\u0101n) is quite unusual, and many translators struggle to\nmake sense of\n it.[23]\n The key is to remember Mencius\u2019s phrases \u201csprout of\nbenevolence\u201d (r\u00e9n zh\u012b du\u0101n) and\n\u201csprout of righteousness\u201d (y\u00ec zh\u012b\ndu\u0101n) from 2A6. While Mencius compares our innate but\nincipient dispositions toward virtue to the sprouts of plants, which\nmust be cultivated in order to reach maturity, Zhuangzi suggests that\nthere is no way to disentangle \u201csprouts\u201d from weeds, if\nthere even is any non\u2013arbitrary distinction between them.\nAnother implicit critique of Mencius is found in a fictional dialogue\nin which Zhuangzi uses \u201cConfucius\u201d as the spokesperson for\nhis own views, and advises someone, \u201cDo not listen with your\nheart but listen with your q\u00ec. \u2026 The heart\nstops with signs. Qi is empty and waits on external things.\nOnly the Way gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the\nheart\u201d (modified from Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2005, 228). So\nZhuangzi prioritizes following the qi, the impersonal fluid\nthat flows through all things and binds them together, over following\nthe heart. This seems to be a deliberate inversion of Mencius\u2019s\nview in 2A2, where he advises, \u201cWhat you do not get from your\nheart, do not seek for in the qi\u201d (2A2; Van Norden\n2008, 37). Notice also that, whereas Mencius encourages us to\ncultivate our heart, Zhuangzi encourages us to \u201cfast\u201d\n it.[24]\n\nXunzi attacks Mencius by name in his essay, \u201cHuman Nature Is\nBad\u201d:\n\nMengzi says: When people engage in learning, this manifests the\ngoodness of their nature. I say: This is not so. This is a case of not\nattaining knowledge of people\u2019s nature and of not inspecting\nclearly the division between people\u2019s nature and their\ndeliberate efforts. \u2026 Those things in people that cannot be\nlearned and cannot be worked at are called their \u201cnature.\u201d\nThose things in people that they become capable of through learning\nand that they achieve through working at them are called their\n\u201cdeliberate efforts.\u201d (Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2005, 299)\n\n\nIt is common to observe that Mencius and Xunzi are speaking at\ncross\u2013purposes, because they assume different conceptions of the\nkey term \u201cnature\u201d (Graham 1967). For Mencius, a\nparadigmatic example of something fulfilling its nature is a sprout\nmaturing into a full\u2013grown plant. This process requires a\nhealthy environment and is assisted by active cultivation on the part\nof the farmer. In contrast, for Xunzi, only the characteristics that\nsomething has fully and innately are part of its nature: \u201cNow\npeople\u2019s nature is such that their eyes can see, and their ears\ncan hear. \u2026 it is clear that one does not learn these\nthings\u201d (Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2005, 299\u2013300). However,\nit is possible that Mencius and Xunzi still have a substantive\ndisagreement, even if Xunzi\u2019s way of framing that disagreement\nis misleading. As we have seen, Mencius thinks that all humans are\nborn with innate but incipient dispositions toward virtue. Xunzi seems\nto explicitly deny this: \u201cAs for the way that the eyes like\npretty colors, the ears like beautiful sounds, the mouth likes good\nflavors, the heart likes what is beneficial, and the bones and flesh\nlike what is comfortable \u2014 these are produced from\npeople\u2019s inborn dispositions and nature\u201d (Ivanhoe and Van\nNorden 2005, 300). In contrast, \u201c\u2026 ritual and the\nstandards of righteousness are produced from the deliberate effort of\nthe sage \u2026\u201d (ibid.). The fundamentally different views of\nMencius and Xunzi on human nature are reflected in their different\nmetaphors for ethical cultivation. For Mencius, ethically cultivating\nhuman nature is like encouraging the innate tendency of a sprout to\ngrow to maturity; for Xunzi, humans require ethical cultivation just\nas \u201ccrooked wood must await steaming and straightening on the\nshaping frame, and only then does it become straight. Blunt metal must\nawait honing and grinding, and only then does it become sharp\u201d\n(Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2005, 298).\n\nConfucianism became a state\u2013sponsored ideology during the Han\ndynasty (202 BCE\u2013220 C.E.), but it was a syncretic form of the\nphilosophy that included elements of Daoism, Legalism, and the\ncosmological notions of yin\u2013yang and the Five Phases.\nMencius\u2019s writings were only one of many influences in this\nperiod. After the fall of the Han, Buddhism became increasingly\ninfluential socially and intellectually, reaching a peak in the Tang\ndynasty (618\u2013907). This provoked a Confucian revivalist\nmovement, the Learning of the Way (D\u00e0oxu\u00e9),\nconventionally referred to in English as Neo\u2013Confucianism. The\npolemical anti\u2013Buddhist writings of Han Yu (768\u2013824) are\noften seen as the flashpoint for the Confucian revival. In addition to\ndenouncing Buddhist practices as unnatural and antithetical to the\nwell being of the state, Han Yu singles out Mencius as the \u201cmost\npure\u201d of the followers of Confucius. Neo\u2013Confucianism only\ncomes to philosophical maturity, though, during the Song and Southern\nSong dynasties (960\u20131279). The major intellectual competitors to\nConfucianism at this time were Buddhism and Daoism.\nNeo\u2013Confucians compared Mozi\u2019s impartial caring to\nBuddhist universal compassion. Similarly, Yang Zhu\u2019s egoism was\nseen as anticipating the Daoist search for individual immortality.\nConsequently, Neo\u2013Confucians availed themselves of\nMencius\u2019s arguments against his contemporaries to combat their\nown intellectual rivals. As a result, Neo\u2013Confucians came to\nregard Mencius as having a particularly profound grasp of the true\nmeaning of the teachings of Confucius, elevating him to the status of\nthe \u201cSecond Sage.\u201d The most influential\nNeo\u2013Confucian philosopher was Zhu Xi, who grouped the\nMengzi along with three other Confucian classics (the\nGreat Learning, Analects, and Mean) as the\nFour Books, and wrote clear, detailed commentaries on each. Zhu\nXi\u2019s interpretations of the Four Books became orthodoxy, and\ngenerations of intellectuals literally memorized them in order to pass\nthe civil service examinations. Although the traditional exams were\nabolished at the beginning of the twentieth century, Zhu Xi\u2019s\ncommitment to reading the Four Books in the light of each other, and\nhis interpretations of specific concepts and passages, continue to\nhave an immense influence, even\n today.[25]\n\nIronically, due to the pervasive influence of Buddhism,\nNeo\u2013Confucian philosophers often reinterpreted Mencius\u2019s\nviews in the light of Buddhist metaphysical and ethical concepts.\nConfucians adopted the view that ethical cultivation was a matter of\nbecoming enlightened (w\u00f9) about the fundamental\nPattern (l\u01d0, also translated principle) of the universe\nand thereby overcoming the selfishness (s\u012b) of human\ndesires (r\u00e9n y\u00f9) and forming one body\n(y\u00ec t\u01d0) with everyone and everything else.\nHowever, these terms are either absent or used in different senses in\nthe texts of Confucius and\n Mencius.[26]\n This criticism was made within the Chinese tradition by later\nConfucians such as Dai Zhen (1724\u20131777), who argued that, due to\nBuddhist influence, the Neo\u2013Confucians understood terms like\n\u201cPattern\u201d in anachronistic ways, and were led to an ethics\nthat unnaturally devalued physical human desires (see Dai 1777). \n\nIn the early 20th century, many Chinese intellectuals became part of\nthe May 4th Movement, which called for China to rapidly Westernize and\nmodernize. As a result, Mencius\u2019s intellectual reputation\nsuffered along with the rest of Confucianism. This trend continued\nduring the rule of Mao Zedong, when Confucianism was dismissed as a\ndecadent part of China\u2019s \u201cfeudal\n past.\u201d[27]\n However, interest in Mencius continued in Hong Kong and Taiwan as\npart of the movement known as New Confucianism. New Confucianism is a\ndiverse movement and it is difficult to find a commonly\nagreed\u2013upon characterization of what is central to it. However,\nmany New Confucians are influenced by the views of Mou Zongsan\n(1909\u20131995), who argued that Mencius and the Neo\u2013Confucian\nWang Yangming accurately explicated what is implicit in the views of\nConfucius. In addition, Mou saw Kant as providing a way of\nunderstanding what is distinctive about the Mencian conception of\nmorality, but also thought that Confucian ethics transcends certain\nlimitations of Kant\u2019s\n thought.[28]\n\nSince the death of Mao, there has been a resurgence of interest in\nConfucianism in mainland China. As a result, Mencius has become\nembroiled in contemporary debates over the role of Confucianism in\nChinese ethics and political philosophy. In two much\u2013debated\npassages, Mencius endorses the actions of a ruler who seems to put\nloyalty to his family over the welfare of the state (5A3, 7A35). Some\nargue that this illustrates that Mencius (and Confucianism in general)\nis committed to a form of nepotism that encourages corruption (see,\ne.g., Liu 2007). Others have argued for alternative interpretations of\nthe significance of these passages (e.g., Guo 2007). Mencius is also\nat the center of the larger debate about whether Confucianism is\nconsistent with democracy (see Chan 1999). Mencius has been invoked as\nproviding a potential foundation for democracy (Bai 2008), but others\nhave cautioned about overestimating the extent to which he champions\nthe will of the people as the source of political authority (Tiwald\n2008). \n\nAnother recent trend in the study of Mencius and other Confucian\nphilosophers has been the application of the framework of virtue\nethics, beginning with Yearley\n (1990).[29]\n Mencius does seem similar to some major virtue ethicists such as\nAristotle in emphasizing wisdom as a flexible responsiveness to\ncomplex situations, the cultivation of virtue over\naction\u2013guiding rules, and nuanced discussions of the differences\nbetween genuine virtues and semblances or counterfeits of them (e.g.,\n7B37). However, as advocates of virtue ethics interpretations\nacknowledge, there are also substantial differences between Mencius\nand any Western virtue ethics. For example, Western virtue ethicists\nsuch as Aristotle place great value on purely theoretical\ncontemplation, which Confucians typically regard as lacking intrinsic\nvalue. An additional contrast is that Confucians like Mencius see\nfamilial life as an important and intrinsic component of living well,\nwhereas Aristotelians (arguably) see the family as, at best, a\nnecessary means to supporting virtuous action.\n\nNew Confucian and virtue ethics interpreters of the Mengzi\nhave both been criticized for projecting an alien vocabulary onto the\ntext. Indeed, sometimes advocates of the two approaches make these\nobjections against one another (see Yu 2008, and Angle and Slote\n2013). However, any interpreter must bring to the text her own\nvocabulary for explicating what seems obscure. This is true whether\nthe commentators are Song dynasty Confucians using\nBuddhist\u2013influenced terms in Middle Chinese, New Confucians\navailing themselves of Kantian notions while writing in contemporary\nMandarin, or English\u2013language scholars employing the vocabulary\nof virtue ethics. Consequently, the only real issue is whether they\nhave provided the most plausible explanation of what is implicit in\nthe texts they interpret. The ongoing debates on these issues promise\nto be exciting and productive. \n",
