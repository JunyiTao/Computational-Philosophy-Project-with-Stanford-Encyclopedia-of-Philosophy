    "main_text": "\n\nPropositional attitude reporting sentences concern cognitive relations\npeople bear to propositions. A paradigm example is the sentence\n\u2018Jill believes that Jack broke his crown\u2019. Arguably,\n\u2018believes, \u2018hopes\u2019, and \u2018knows\u2019 are\npropositional attitude verb and, when followed by a clause that\nincludes a full sentence expressing a proposition (a\nthat-clause) form propositional attitude reporting sentences.\nAttributions of cognitive relations to propositions can also take\nother forms. For example, \u2018Jack believes what Jill said\u2019\nand \u2018Jack believes everything Jill believes\u2019 are both\npropositional attitude ascriptions, even though the attitude verb is\nnot followed by a that-clause. Some philosophers and linguists also\nclaim that sentences like \u2018Jill wanted Jack to fall\u2019,\n\u2018Jack and Jill are seeking water\u2019, and \u2018Jack fears\nJill\u2019, for example, are to be analyzed as propositional attitude\nascribing sentences, the first saying, perhaps, something to the\neffect that Jill wants that Jack falls, the second that Jack\nand Jill strive that they find water, and the third that Jack\nfears that Jill will hurt him. But such analyses are\ncontroversial. (See the entry on\n intensional transitive verbs.)\n\nHaving a successful theory of propositional attitude reports is\nimportant, as they serve as a converging point for a number of\ndifferent fields, including philosophy of language, natural language\nsemantics, philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and epistemology.\n\nIn this article, we examine attempts to deal with a puzzle about\npropositional attitude reporting sentences that was first posed by\nGottlob Frege in his 1892. Subsequent literature has been concerned\nwith developing a semantic theory that offers an adequate treatment of\nthis puzzle. We present the main theories and note the considerations\nthat count in their favor and some of the problems that they face.\n",
