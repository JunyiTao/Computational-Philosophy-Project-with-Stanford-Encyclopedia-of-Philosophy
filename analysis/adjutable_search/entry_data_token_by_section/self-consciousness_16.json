    "main_text": "The Conditions of Self-Consciousness || Self-Consciousness and Consciousness\n4.3 Self-Consciousness and Consciousness\n\nCentral to the history of the self-consciousness sketched in\n \u00a71\n is a concern with the relation between self-consciousness and\nconsciousness. Since self-consciousness is itself a form of\nconsciousness, consciousness is, of course, a necessary condition of\nit. But is self-consciousness necessary for consciousness? Positive\nanswers to this question come in both reductive and non-reductive\nvarieties.\n\nOne way in which consciousness might entail self-consciousness is if\nthe former is reducible to the latter. One such family of\nviews are\n higher order theories of consciousness\n which maintain that a psychological state is conscious if and only if\nit is represented, in the right way, by a higher order state (Gennaro\n2004; for a very different account that nevertheless posits a tight\nconnection between consciousness and self-consciousness, see\nO\u2019Shaughnessy 2002: ch. 3). A natural assumption is that this\nhigher order state is distinct from that which it represents. Higher\nOrder theories that accept this assumption fall into two camps: Higher\nOrder Thought (HOT) theories (Rosenthal 1986, 2005; Carruthers 2000,\n2005), which maintain that the higher order state is a thought or\nbelief, and Higher Order Perception (HOP) theories (Armstrong 1968;\nLycan 1996, 2004), which by contrast maintain that the higher order\nstate is a perception-like sensory state\u2014an exercise of the sort\nof inner perception, or \u201cinner sense\u201d, that was\nextensively debated throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies (Thiel 2011; see \u00a73.1). Since, however, we can be aware\nthat someone else is in some conscious state, it seems that\nsimply being aware that a thought is occurring is insufficient to\nrender that thought conscious. Arguably, what is required is that one\nbe aware that one is in the relevant first-order state. That\nis, one represents oneself as being in the state in question.\nSince this seems to involve a form of self-awareness, the HOT and HOP\ntheories can be understood as holding that consciousness entails\nself-consciousness (Gennaro 1996). Given this, it is natural to think\nof the distinction between HOT and HOP theories of consciousness as\nclosely related to that between conceptual and non-conceptual\nself-consciousness.\n\nAn alternative to HOT and HOP theories that still maintains the\nambition to reduce consciousness to self-consciousness is the\nself-representational view (Kriegel & Williford 2006; Kriegel\n2009; Caston 2002), according to which a psychological state is\nconscious if and only if it represents itself. Such accounts are\nhigher-order views that deny that the first and second-order states\nare distinct. As with both HOT and HOP, self-representationalism can\nbe thought of as supporting the view that a form of self-consciousness\nis a necessary condition of consciousness. Kriegel (2003) dubs this\n\u201cintransitive self-consciousness\u201d, the phenomenon\npurportedly picked out by phrases of the form \u201cI am\nself-consciously thinking that P\u201d, and distinguishes it from the\n\u201ctransitive self-consciousness\u201d purportedly picked out by\nphrases of the form \u201cI am self-conscious of my thought that\nP\u201d. This is a version of the distinction between reflective and\npre-reflective self-consciousness discussed in\n \u00a73.2\n (and the views of Fichte and Sartre mentioned in\n \u00a71;\n cf. Kapitan 1999). If conscious states are those that represent\nthemselves then, it might be argued, consciousness entails\nintransitive self-consciousness, since one\u2019s conscious states do\nnot only represent themselves but also (in some way implicitly)\nrepresent oneself as having them (Kriegel 2003: 104).\n\nAristotle, considering a version of the HOP theory, argued that the\nview suffered from a regress problem since the higher-order perception\nmust itself be conscious and so be accompanied by a HOP, which would\nitself be conscious, and so on (De Anima 3.2; Caston 2002).\nThe standard way to diffuse such a worry is to deny that the higher\norder state, be it perception or thought, need be conscious. An\nalternative, of course, is to endorse a self-representational account.\nThere are other objections to higher order views, however, each of\nwhich applies to one or more versions of the view. They include\nworries about the possibility of objectless and non-veridical higher\norder states (Byrne 1997; Block 2011), about whether it can account\nfor the conscious states of infants and non-humans (Dretske 1995: ch.\n4; Tye 1995: ch. 1), the complaint that the postulation of a distinct\nhigher-order state for every conscious state leads to an unnecessarily\n\u201ccluttered picture of the mind\u201d (Chalmers 1996: 231), and\nthe fundamental worry that no form of higher-order view has the\nresources to explain consciousness at all (Levine 2006; cf.\nKriegel 2012). As such, higher-order and self-representational\ntheories of consciousness, that posit a necessary connection between\nconsciousness and self-consciousness, are far from being\nestablished.\n\nIf consciousness cannot be reduced to self-consciousness, perhaps the\nlatter is nevertheless a necessary condition of the former. Some\nnon-reductive views, already mentioned, see pre-reflective\nconsciousness (see\n \u00a73.2),\n or the sense of ownership (see\n \u00a73.3)\n as necessary conditions of consciousness (see Zahavi 2005). A\ndifferent non-reductive, and broadly Kantian, argument for the claim\nthat self-consciousness is a necessary condition of consciousness\nfirst of all claims that conscious experience is necessarily unified\nand, second, that this unity of consciousness in turn depends on\nself-awareness. Of primary interest here is the second step which is\narticulated by Strawson in his discussion of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental deduction as the claim that, \n\n\nif different experiences are to belong to a single consciousness,\nthere must be the possibility of self\u00ad-consciousness on\nthe part of the subject of those experiences. (P.F. Strawson 1966: 93;\nfor discussion of Kant\u2019s views of the matter, see Henrich 1989;\nPowell 1990; Brook 1994; Keller 1998; Kitcher 2011; Allison 2015; for\ndetailed discussion of whether consciousness is necessarily unified,\nsee Bayne 2010; see also entry on\n unity of consciousness).\n \n\n\nOne reason for supposing that there is a connection between\nself-consciousness and the unity of consciousness is given by Kant,\nwho writes, \n\n\nonly because I can comprehend their manifold in a consciousness do I\ncall them altogether my representations; for\notherwise I would have as multi-coloured diverse a self as I have\nrepresentations of which I am conscious. (Kant 1781/1787: B134) \n\n\nThat is, a single self must be able to \u201ccomprehend\u201d its\nown experiences together, otherwise they would not really be its own.\nSuch \u201ccomprehension\u201d would seem to involve\nself-consciousness. As Kant famously puts it, \n\n\n[t]he I think must be able to\naccompany all my representations for otherwise something would be\nrepresented in me that could not be thought at all, which is as much\nas to say that the representation would either be impossible or else\nat least would be nothing for me. (Kant 1781/1787: B131\u2013132)\n\n\n\nOn this view, it is the unity of the self that guarantees that\nco-conscious experiences are jointly self-ascribable; that unity\nrequires self-consciousness (there is a question as to whether\nself-consciousness is here supposed to explain the unity of\nconsciousness; cf. Dainton\u2019s strong and weak\n\u201cI-thesis\u201d (2000: \u00a72.3)). This Kantian picture is\nassociated with the claim that unified self-consciousness requires a\nconception of the world as objective; as transcending the perspective\nthat one has on it. The idea here is that to self-ascribe an\nexperience one must have some grasp of the distinction between\none\u2019s (subjective) experience that the (objective) condition of\nwhich it is an experience (these issues are explored in P.F. Strawson\n1966; Bennett 1966; Evans 1980; Cassam 1997; Sacks 2000; also see\nBurge 2010: ch. 6).\n\nThe claim that the unity of consciousness requires self-consciousness\ncan be criticised in a number of different ways. How one evaluates the\nclaim will depend on whether one has conceptual or non-conceptual\nself-consciousness in mind. As Bayne (2004) points out, the claim that\nthe unity of consciousness requires that one possess the concept of\noneself seems, implausibly, to imply that conceptually unsophisticated\ninfants and non-human animals could not possess a unified stream of\nconsciousness (of course, this worry applies quite generally to views\nthat connect consciousness with self-consciousness). The view that\nnon-conceptual self-consciousness is a necessary condition of the\nunity of consciousness would appear to be vulnerable to the objection\nthat it implausibly rules out the possibility of cases such as\nAnscombe\u2019s (1975) subject in a sensory deprivation tank, a case\nin which the forms of experience typically classed as forms of\nnon-conceptual self-consciousness are lacking (for related cases see\nBayne 2004; also see G. Strawson 1999). A different worry about the\nconnection between self-consciousness and the unity of consciousness\nis the \u201cjust more content\u201d objection (B. Williams 1978:\nch. 3; Hurley 1994; and 1998 Part I). The concern is addressed to the\nview that self-consciousness is not merely a necessary condition of\nthe unity of consciousness but is that in virtue of which it is\nunified. For if the self-ascription of experiences is taken to be that\nwhich is responsible for the unity of consciousness, how can we\naccount for the fact that the self-conscious thoughts are themselves\nunified with the first-order experiences that they supposedly unify?\nAs Hurley puts it, \n\n\nself-conscious or first-person contents [\u2026] are just more\ncontents, to which the problem of co-consciousness [i.e., the\nunity of consciousness] also applies (1998: 61) \n\n\nTo appeal to the third-order self-ascription of the self-conscious\nthought would appear to invite a regress.\n",
