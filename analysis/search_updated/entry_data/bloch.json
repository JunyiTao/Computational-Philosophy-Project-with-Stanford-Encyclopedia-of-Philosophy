    "preamble": "\n\nErnst Bloch (1885\u20131977) was a German philosopher and cultural\ncritic who is mostly credited for renewing the interest in utopia and\nfor mediating between the radical philosophy of emancipation,\nnon-dogmatic religious thought, analysis of mass culture, and new\naesthetic forms, notably those of Expressionism. His books, especially\nThe Principle of Hope (1954\u20131959), contributed to a\nparticular form of critical theory and, being written in a peculiar\nessayistic style, made him quite popular both in academic and\nnon-academic circles. Bloch was an important voice among the\nintelligentsia of Weimar Germany and then, for a short period\nafter the Second World war, the leading philosopher of the Eastern\nGermany. However, he quickly became a \u201cdeviator\u201d for the\nMarxist ideologists. Beyond the Eastern bloc, he made a profound\nimpact on utopian studies, theology, and aesthetics of the previous\ncentury, but also, generally, on political philosophy and critical\ntheory. Bloch\u2019s leftist orientation and the optimistic account\nof hope made him a critic of existentialist thought, despite many\ngenealogical and stylistic affinities to it. Basing on Hegel and Marx,\nbut also drawing on many other intellectual traditions, Bloch sought\nto formulate the ontology and political philosophy for uncertain and\nopen-ended world. This was reflected in his \u201cutopian\nhermeneutics\u201d seeking to uncover the unfinishedness, the\n\u201cnot yet\u201d in any phenomenon of nature or culture; in his\nsensitivity to the immediacy of human existence (inspired, in part, by\nthe phenomenological movement) and to the various forms of mass\nculture; and in his attempts to reformulate Marxism as an utopian\nproject of humanization of nature/naturalization of humans. The\nexperience of utopian non-identity is elevated to the level of the\nontological principle: \u201cS is not yet P\u201d, and\nthe human quest for emancipation is grounded in the unfulfilled state\nof being itself.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Short biography\n\nErnst Bloch was born on the eighth of July 1885 in Ludwigshafen am\nRhein, to a family of a railway employee, almost fully alien to\nacademic life. But this did not upset his early interest in\nphilosophy, supported and reinforced by his experiences in the library\nand the theater of the neighboring city of Mannheim, as well as by his\ncorrespondence with important thinkers of the time (Ernst Mach,\nTheodor Lipps, Eduard von Hartmann and Wilhelm Windelband). Between\n1905 and 1908 Bloch studied philosophy (but also physics and musical\ntheory as minors) in Munich and W\u00fcrzburg, eventually defending\nhis doctoral dissertation, later published under the title\nCritical Reflections on Heinrich Rickert and the Problem of the\nModern Theory of Knowledge (Bloch 1909). He then moved to Berlin,\nwhere he participated in the private colloquium around Georg Simmel\nbetween 1908 and 1911, and to Heidelberg (between 1912 and 1914),\nwhere the circle around Max Weber was Bloch\u2019s main attraction.\nIn these years, a close friendship with Georg Luk\u00e1cs played a\nprominent role in Bloch\u2019s intellectual\ndevelopment\u2014something Luk\u00e1cs also acknowledged for\nhimself while recollecting the encounter with Bloch.\n\nDuring the World War I, Bloch lived in Swiss exile: he firmly opposed\nthe war from the beginning, thus radically differing from most German\nintellectuals at that time. In Switzerland, he was working on his\nfirst major book, The Spirit of Utopia (1918 [2000]). Its\ngeneral spiritualist sentiment was very much due to his first wife,\nElse Bloch-von Stritzki, a devoted Christian. This book contained, as\na relatively autonomous part, Bloch\u2019s most extensive work on the\nphilosophy of music. Another project was a book on formal logic (Bloch\n1985c: 253), which remained a manuscript and was lost in the 1930s\n(Zudeick 1985). Parallel to this work, Bloch was active as a\npolitically engaged public intellectual (Bloch 1923 [1964]; 1985a),\ncriticizing both the militarist Germany and the authoritarian\nbolshevist Soviet Russia (Franz 1985). In 1919, he went back to\nBerlin, where he lived most of the years till 1933, with long stays in\nMunich, Paris, and in different places in Italy and France. In these\nyears Bloch, being both a Jew and an unorthodox thinker, had no\nprospects for an academic career in Germany and mostly worked as a\nfree essayist (Bloch 2007). The major writings from that period\ninclude an historically and philosophically informed biography\nThomas M\u00fcntzer as Theologian of Revolution (1921 [GA\n2]); the new, 1923 edition of The Spirit of Utopia (of which\nthe ultimate version appeared in 1964, see Bloch 1918 [2000], [GA 3]);\nTraces (1930 [2006], [GA 1]), the collection of essays,\nanecdotes and short stories, mostly dating back to the 1910s; and the\nbook on politics and ideology Heritage of Our Times (1935\n[1991], [GA 4]). In the 1930s, Bloch was also working on a long\nsystematic manuscript on the theory and history of materialism\n(Theory-Praxis of Matter), parts of which were eventually\npublished in 1972 as The Problem of Materialism, Its History and\nSubstance (GA 7) and in 2000 as The Logos of Matter\n(Bloch 2000a).\n\nIn 1933, Bloch had to flee to Switzerland, and began roaming around\nEurope (Vienna, Paris, Prague), not least because his wife, Karola,\nwas active as a secret agent of German and Austrian communist party.\nAt that time, he became a resolute Marxist (Bloch 1972b) and even paid\ntribute to the Stalinist hysteria by supporting the show trials of\n1937\u20131938. Still, in 1938 he emigrated not to the Soviet Union,\nas did Luk\u00e1cs, but to the United States. There, he lived (in\nNew York; Marlborough, New Hampshire; and, in 1942\u20131949, in\nCambridge, Massachusetts) concentrated on writing and isolated both\nfrom the American intellectual scene (he hardly spoke English) and\nfrom his fellow emigr\u00e9s (his relations with Adorno\u2019s and\nHorkheimer\u2019s Institute of Social Research were strained). In\n1949, Bloch moved with his family to the newly formed German\nDemocratic Republic to teach philosophy at the University of Leipzig\n(Bloch 1985b). His magnum opus written mostly in the US,\nThe Principle of Hope, was published there and in West\nGermany in 1954\u201359 (GA 5).\n\nThough enthusiastic in the beginning, having received some academic\nrecognition, Bloch came increasingly under pressure and, from 1957 on,\nwhen he was made emeritus, was facing a total isolation, while his\nphilosophy was declared reactionary. The loyalty to Communist power he\nhad been demonstrating, sometimes in quite conformist ways, since the\n1930s, did not change much in the fact that his thinking was clearly\nat odds with the official Marxist doctrine (Caysa et al. 1992). In\n1961, while being on holiday and having learned about the building of\nthe Berlin Wall, Bloch decided to stay in West Germany and to make, as\nhe formulated himself a bit later, the leap from the realm of\nnecessity into the realm of freedom (interview with J. R\u00fchle\n1964, in Traub & Wieser 1975: 21). Bloch then became, not without\ndifficulties, a guest professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen.\nThere, he was teaching and working on the edition of his complete\nworks (published in 1959\u20131978). In these years, his work became\nwidely known, he received numerous awards and honorary degrees, was\nactive as a public speaker (Bloch 1980) and became an icon of the\nGerman Left. In 1961, Natural Law and Human Dignity was\npublished (GA 6), completed in the beginning of the 1940s (see Bloch\n1985c: 528), followed by other key systematic and historical texts,\nsuch as T\u00fcbingen Introduction to Philosophy (1963/64, GA\n13), Atheism in Christianity (1968, GA 14), and\nExperimentum Mundi (1975, GA 15). Bloch remained politically\nactive throughout this last period of his life. He died on the fourth\nof August 1977 in T\u00fcbingen.\n2. Bloch\u2019s Ontology of the Unfinished\n2.1 The Core Ideas of Utopian Philosophy\n\nBloch\u2019s philosophy is guided by the interest in the\nontologically grounded incompleteness of the world and the associated\ndrive towards the future. Genuine future, for Bloch, is radically\nuncertain: it is something that has never been before (GA 13: 228;\nBloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 1375f.]). One could think about this\nperspective as an attempt to formulate the specific relation of being\nand time, in which the future becomes constitutive modus of being (and\nof the present). The main philosophical question to be answered would\nthen be: how can the future, or utopia, be present\u2014as objective\npossibility\u2014and recognized\u2014as anticipation (Holz 1975)?\nPhilosophy\u2019s major task, for Bloch, becomes the exploration of\nthe possibilities inherent in our world, and the ontological formula\nproper to it is \u201cS is not yet P,\u201d meaning\nthat reality (or matter) is in the process of predication, and the\nworld itself is on the move searching for its essence. This short\nformula captures both the transitory, processual character of being,\nand the negativity associated with this\n process.[1]\n\nAs an open-ended process, a Not-Yet in the presence, reality must be\ngrasped both as unfinished and in its entirety. Even when a\nwish is fulfilled, when the dream comes true, there is an irreducible\nremainder to it that does not let one completely satisfied. The major\nproblem for Bloch\u2019s philosophy is thus to find the ways the\nfuture, that becomes the key dimension of\n time,[2]\n could still be discovered, recognized, and explored as part of the\npresent. This dynamic moment is also referred to as an \u201cutopian\nfunction\u201d. The notion of utopia is so central in Bloch precisely\nbecause it captures this anticipatory drive of realizing something\nqualitatively new (novum), but doing it not in an\n\u201cabstract\u201d way, as merely an invocation of a general\nnormative ideal, but rather in a form of immanent critique and thus of\na dialectical mediation, something Bloch calls \u201cconcrete\nutopia\u201d. The object of anticipation, or what Bloch later\ndescribed as \u201cUltimum\u201d, is a reality of non-alienated,\nnon-exploitative relations of humans among each other and with the\nnature. Bloch\u2019s philosophy is loaded with this normative meaning\nof the directedness towards the unity of the ideal and the real.\n\nBloch thus conceives of the world as a utopian whole. In this\nontological conception, logic also plays its role\u2014not as the\nbeginning of knowledge, for Bloch insists on wonder and amazement as\nits beginning (see below),\u2014but in its heuristic function\nformalizing and structuring the categories needed to grasp a complex\nchanging reality (Bloch 2000a). Bloch\u2019s \u201cspeculative\nmaterialism\u201d understands matter as \u201creal\npossibility\u201d (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 235f.]), natura\nnaturans, which does not require an external formal\ndetermination, but rather bears its future within itself. Matter is\nthus historicized. \u201cSpeculative\u201d implies that matter, the\nsource of radical novelty, is the concept that relates to the totality\nof the world, and not just to its single aspect (Moir 2019b). It is\nthis ontological reference that defines Bloch\u2019s key insight:\nutopia is not a \u201cmere\u201d phantasy, since it is the whole\nworld, which is dreaming, or \u201cventuring beyond\u201d.\n\nHowever, early Bloch tries to grasp this dimension of the future\nmostly by referring to the subjectivity (\u201csoul\u201d, as he\ncalls it in The Spirit of Utopia or \u201crevolutionary\nmagic of the subject\u201d, as in Thomas M\u00fcntzer) and\ncommunity of those who should fulfill the utopian promise the world\ngives to itself. In his first books Bloch speaks a spiritualist,\nprophetic, performative language and draws heavily on the wealth of\nmystical\u2014in particular, gnostic\u2014traditions, in a\nparadoxical attempt to synthesize them with Marxist materialism\n(Christen 1979). This focus on subjective anticipation led Adorno to\nremark that Bloch\u2019s key argument is akin to an ontological\nproof: the very presence and persistence of utopian anticipation, the\nvery desire to transcend the status quo supports the idea\nthat the world is pregnant with unrealized possibilities (Bloch 1988:\n16).\n\nThe important starting point for Bloch\u2019s philosophy is, in\nvarious forms, the subjective experience of non-identity and fragility\nthat goes under the names of \u201cdarkness of the lived\nmoment\u201d or \u201cthe shape of inconstruable question\u201d\n(denoting the impossibility of formulating the ultimate metaphysical\nproblem without relying on a pre-given solution) (Czajka 2006). Bloch\nemphasizes the non-availability of the very core of our existence and\nthe associated feeling of lack. Human consciousness can never fully\nexperience itself and cannot immediately grasp the full meaning of its\nmomentary state (1969 [GA 10: 74, 145f.]). The darkness of the future\nserves as the objective counterpart of this experience.\n\nDealing with the phenomena of temporality\u2014along with the\nepisodes of amazement (Staunen) or estrangement\n(Verfremdung)\u2014should demonstrate how the perceived\nreality, as well as the traditional epistemology that assumes it fixed\nand given, can be destabilized and open to intentional anticipatory\npraxis. Bloch considers temporality in its qualitative, intensive\ndimension, it is attached to\u2014and is, in its very definition,\ndependent on\u2014what is happening existentially and historically\n(GA 13: 129, 138; see also Holz 1975; Hartmann 2012). For Bloch,\nunlike in the philosophies of dur\u00e9e, the discontinuity\nof time and its social conditionality are decisive (Levinas 1976).\nWhile estrangement demonstrates the falsity of the given context, the\namazement, that is as ineffable and as transient as the darkness of\nthe lived moment (Bloch 1918 [2000: 199f.]), reveals the final\nidentity of subject and object.\n\nLater, Bloch formulated the notion of \u201cfront\u201d as the most\nactual moment of the process that often requires our ability to grasp\nnew opportunities (Siebers 2012). For Bloch\u2019s idea of\ntemporality, the concept of fulfilled moment is also important, for\nthis is the moment that is being anticipated in many utopian\nprojections. The intensity of Bloch\u2019s early thinking rests on\nthe unresolved contradiction between the insistence on full immediate\npresence of the utopian (primarily of ethical nature, such as the\nself-evidence of the good), and the impossibility to fully grasp,\narticulate, and appropriate it.\n\nIn the later work, Bloch is more systematic in putting together his\nphilosophical intuitions, and less radical in staging the epiphanies\nof the world\u2019s utopian goal. For example, he tries to codify\ndifferent levels of a \u201cpossibility\u201d (Bloch 1954\u201359\n[1986a: Ch. 18]). But even later, in the T\u00fcbingen\nIntroduction to Philosophy, the starting point of his reflection\nis an existential human drive (hunger). Bloch then describes this\nprocess of realization in a more abstract form as a way from the That\n(Da\u00df), an active potency, to its product, the What\n(Was). The structures of objective world come to themselves\nvia the \u201csubjective factor\u201d. It is this critical\nsubjectivity that helps escape the reification of various structures\nof reality and allows to study it in its processual complexity (Bloch\n2000a), and it is this subjective intervention that is called for in\nthe open-ended process, because its outcome is uncertain and dependent\non this human praxis (Gekle 1986). Bloch envisions a mutual\ndialectical mediation of the subjective and the objective\n(\u201cnaturalization of human and humanization of nature\u201d, see\nRaulet 1982) and maintains that the matter moves on a higher level\nwhen comprehended and mediated by human practical consciousness that\nemerges within it, the laboring individual as its potentiality (Bloch\n1954\u201359 [1986a: 261]). As Bloch puts it, the human is the answer\nto the world-as-question, whereby this question itself is understood\nin all its existential intensity. This emergence of consciousness and\nfreedom (Moir 2019b) itself reflects the inherent disposition within\nmatter as an open process, its autonomous activity, something Bloch\ngladly inherits from the \u201capocryphal\u201d traditions of\nmaterialism\u2014\u201cleft\u201d Aristotelianism (Bloch 1952\n[2018]) and Renaissance thinkers, notably Giordano Bruno, but also\nSchelling (Habermas 1969/1970). As Bloch reads this tradition, the\ncreation of the world is not a wholly external act, but a\n\u201cself-movement, self-fertilization of the matter of God\u201d\n(Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 236]). The utopian process for Bloch is\nalso a realization of the \u201crealizing element\u201d (cf. Bloch\n1954\u201359 [1986a: ch. 20]; GA 15, ch. 49), a fulfillment of an\nactive subjectivity. In Bloch\u2019s ontology\u2014that can always\nbe also read as an anthropology (Siebers 2013)\u2014the redemption of\nnature and of the human being are thus presupposing each other.\n\nFollowing various strands of philosophy, Bloch thus develops a\nqualitative vision of nature, he conceives nature as a creative drive\ntowards the realization of the possible (or latency), a drive that can\nbe understood with the concept of nature-subject\n(Natursubjekt), something that could be reproached as\nanthropomorphism (Habermas 1969/1970). A nature-subject itself remains\nan internal impulse, an \u201cimmanent agency\u201d (Moir 2013:\n128f.) within the material world (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 673]).\nTo put it in aesthetic terminology, Bloch reminds us that the\nlandscape\u2014a human creation\u2014is a potentiality of nature.\nThe chance for a better outcome in the history of nature is not only\ndependent on the human activity but is\u2014qua this\nactivity\u2014the potentiality of nature itself.\n\nThe concept of hope captures the universal anticipatory drive\nin human and non-human world\u2014as permeated by futurity. For\nBloch, hope is self-consciousness of human praxis (Holz 1975)\nthat needs an ontological foundation. Many hopes can turn out to be\nillusions, but even illusory hopes can give indications to some very\nreal human wishes and drives. Hope aims at something uncertain and\noften beyond the control of the actor (Tegtmeyer 2012), and thus can\nalways be disappointed. It is this uncertainty that made Riedel (1994)\ninterpret Bloch\u2019s early philosophy as a form of a postmodern\n\u201cweak thought\u201d in the spirit of Vattimo (1985 [1988]), a\nthought that refuses to seek prior transcendent foundations for\nitself.\n\nThe inherent\nopenness of the object of hope is\u2014unlike the existential fear, which,\nBloch remarks, can also anticipate,\u2014enabling, rather than\nlimiting the human capacities, because this is the uncertainty of\npotentialities, that, despite being often disappointed, never cease to\nexist (Vidal 2012). Bloch distinguishes hope from quietism and thinks\nof it as a practical, transformative attitude to the world. As such,\nit cannot be blind and \u201cabstract\u201d, but should be grounded\nin objective real tendencies, something that also precludes Bloch from\nembracing an absolute contingency of the future.\n\nAn important anthropological dimension of Bloch\u2019s ontology is\nthe idea of the \u201cNot-Yet-Conscious\u201d, which Bloch would\nthen oppose to the Freudian emphasis on the unconscious as something\n\u201cno longer conscious\u201d, or repressed. In this critique,\nBloch assumes that the unconscious is merely quantitatively different\nfrom the conscious, complementing it\u2014and not a completely,\nqualitatively different domain that limits the conscious, as Freud\nbelieved (Gekle 1986). Unlike Freud, Bloch is more interested in the\nways human desires and drives contribute to the political emancipatory\npraxis. He accuses Freud of a tautological closedness associated with\nhis understanding of the unconscious: for Bloch, Freud\u2019s\npsychoanalysis aims at merely reconstructing what has already been, or\nrecollecting, instead of venturing towards the radical and unsettling\nnovelty of the Not-Yet. Similar critique is voiced against Plato or\nBergson (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a]), but most significantly, in\nSubjekt-Objekt, against Hegel\u2019s dialectics as\n\u201canamnesis\u201d (1951 [GA 8]). The general pattern of this\ncritique is the distrust toward the arguments that explain phenomena\nby grounding them in a deeper essential principle, whereby the\nprinciple itself, as eternal truth, remains posited and unchanged.\nEven in Hegel Bloch finds a fetishization of the logical idea and the\ntendency to closure, reducing the ontological process to the static\nconstruction of the idealistic absolute.\n2.2 Some of Bloch\u2019s intellectual origins and affinities\n\nBloch\u2019s philosophy is shaped by many previous traditions: he\ninherits his account of matter from Aristotle and \u201cLeft\nAristotelianism\u201d; his notions of tendencies and drives are\ninspired by Leibniz\u2019 idea of appetitus that denotes the\nmode of the future\u2019s existence within the present; Bloch\u2019s\ninsistence on immanent objectivity has Spinoza as one of its origins;\nthe primacy of practical reason, given the fundamental\nnon-transparency of the world, and the appreciation of the\nnon-empirical, non-deterministic reality of normativity are for Bloch\nassociated with Kant; his critical perspective on reality as\nconsisting of self-transcending social entities and practices is\nprompted by Hegel and Marx; his appreciation of a primordial intensity\nand contingency, a pre-logical being that precedes and goes beyond the\nlogic or reason, as an irreducible remainder, is following Schelling;\nhis process thinking, the urgency to engage with the irrational, or\nthe Dionysian, the belief in the expressive powers of language, as\nwell as Bloch\u2019s optimism were reflecting his early fascination\nwith Nietzsche; his attention to everyday experiences and mundane\ncultural forms, as well as to the importance of an \u201cindividual\nlaw\u201d, was shaped by\n Simmel.[3]\n\nHegel\u2019s perspective is also crucial for Bloch\u2019s\nepistemology. The process of knowing is essentially reconsidered as a\nprocess of self-understanding, or self-articulation, of the open world\n(Cunico 2000). The epistemic categories are thus the forms of\nexistence, but instead of spirit Bloch deals with matter. Since this\nmaterial world is unfinished, his epistemology also implies the active\ninvolvement in the world, a network of concepts referring to each\nother (Holz 1975), without stable definitions, but rather as being the\noutcomes of dialectical processes. It is also by recourse to\ndialectics that Bloch is trying to resolve the difficulty of grasping\nradical novelty, while maintaining that it has not been revealed.\nBloch often uses the dialectical figures of mediation in, e.g.,\nwilling to synthesize Kant and Hegel in The Spirit of Utopia\n(Bloch 1918 [2000: 185f.]), or utopias of freedom (as advanced by\nThomas More) and order (envisioned by\nTommaso Campanella) in The Principle of\nHope (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 528f.]). But Bloch eventually\nwants to go beyond Hegel because he lacks there the true novelty, the\nopenness, and sees in it the reduction of the existential experience\nto the movement of the totality (something Bloch also bemoans in the\nmost advanced piece of Hegelian Marxism he was exposed to, namely,\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019 History and Class Consciousness) (Hudson\n1982).\n\nBloch\u2019s attention to existential experiences and his tendency,\nin his aesthetic essays, to reflect on specific, rich thingness (like\nthat of an old pitcher in The Spirit of Utopia) prompt\nparallels to Heidegger\u2014to the point that Bloch was sometimes\neven referred to as a left-\u00adwing Heidegger. Moreover, the\npolitical proclivities of Heidegger are paralleled in Bloch\u2019s\nStalinist posture of the 1930s (M\u00fcnster 1987; Zipes\n2019). Indeed, Bloch poses the question of being as early as 1918 and\ntries to answer it with the focus on human existence (Riedel 1994),\nwhile Heidegger\u2019s gives priority to the future in his analysis\nof temporality (Levinas 1976).  But for Heidegger, the feeling of\nthrownness and the existential fear (Angst) are central\naffects pertaining to the future, which is obviously opposed to\nBloch\u2019s idea of futurity. Bloch\u2019s Heimat, unlike\nHeidegger\u2019s, is something to be anticipated, as a horizon of the\nutopian movement, and not something that precedes our experience as\nits lost foundation (Habermas 1969/1970; Korstvedt 2010), it is,\nmoreover, something one needs to actively precipitate and not\npassively expect.\n2.3 Preliminary outlook\n\nBloch\u2019s writing style is unorthodox: he prefers to begin with\nlaconic phrases, resembling/striving to become aphorisms, and indulges\nin metaphors while often avoiding precise definitions. The ultimate\naim of this philosophy cast in \u201copen-ended essays\u201d (Holz\n1975) is to decipher the not-yet-uncovered utopian elements of the\nworld by showing\u2014somewhat performatively (Siebers 2013) and\nprivileging style over (not fully available) content (Edwards\n2013)\u2014how various concepts work as applied to particular\ncultural domains, rather than by building a logically coherent\ntheoretical\n system.[4]\n Indeed, such a system\u2019s closedness would contradict\nBloch\u2019s main ontological stance that implies spelling out the\ntensions, rather than resolving them (Adorno 1980).\n\nUtopian anticipation plays an ambiguous role in Bloch\u2019s\nphilosophy. On the one hand, it attaches special meanings to different\nelements of material and social reality, to various fragments of\nnature and history and thus serves, teleologically, as a unifying\nnormative force (1951 [GA 8: 487]), sometimes creating the impression\nthat Bloch overemphasizes the unity of futurity for its own sake\n(Eagleton 2015). On the other hand, it suspends any given form or\nentity as experimental and preliminary, emphasizes the risk of\nfetishizing the utopian goal, the teleology of the pre-given plan, and\ninsists on the impossibility to fully construe the new from the old,\non radical incompleteness of any achieved state or any present process\n(Lyotard 1976). The problem of the absolute is re-stated by Bloch as\nthe non-availability of the future and even of the tools to fully\ngrasp it. Crucially, this incompleteness also entails a permanent risk\nof failure, which again, dialectically, is just an opposite side of a\nfundamental instability and mutability of our world (Bloch\ncharacteristically calls things Auszugsgestalten ihrer\nselbst, \u201cforms of departure from themselves\u201d [Bloch\n1954\u201359 [1986a: 1345]]). In this sense, the question: where does\nutopia go? Or What is the eschatological aim of the utopian\nprocess?\u2014is both necessary and unanswerable. It should\nbe asked for defining the normative orientation of hope and for\nestablishing a proper critical function of \u201cconcrete\nutopia\u201d. But its answer is never perfect, either. In the state\nof absolute fulfillment, there is no place for utopian philosophy.\nThis philosophy is subject to its own critical scrutiny, its aims are\nonly formulated in the process, and its business itself is never\ncomplete. That is why the original title of\nThe Principle of Hope was Dreams of a Better\nLife, not of a best life. This negative dialectical\nvision makes Bloch not a Hegelian of a system (indeed, he attacked\n\u201cthe system\u201d when it was associated with East European\n\u201csocialist\u201d unfreedom), but a Hegelian of a promise.\n3. Ethics, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion\n3.1 General ideas in practical philosophy\n\nIn view of Bloch\u2019s ontology, the central aim of his practical\nphilosophy is to free the world to its radically, qualitatively new\npossibilities. In this, the critical and normative function of utopia\nplays a major role (Levitas 1990; Moir 2019b): humans are defined as\ninherently utopian beings (GA 13: 239); the world is\namenable to change through human praxis; and the subjective\nutopian drive paired with objective tendencies condition this\nprocessual vision. In fact, Bloch\u2019s whole philosophy is the\ninvestigation into various forms of practical intentionality\u2014or,\nas Habermas (1969/1970) puts it, the way to redress Schellingian idea\nof potencies in a Marxist interpretation: in Bloch, a working\nsocialized human being realizing these potencies comes central stage.\nBloch\u2019s ontological emphasis on natura naturans is\nparalleled by the centrality of the productive force in the ontology\nof society (Bloch 2000a). It is this historical intersubjective\ndimension, always accompanying existential experience and prompting it\nto active transformation of its world, that, Bloch believes, makes his\nphilosophy so different from Heidegger\u2019s. Even his early\nspiritualist attempts focusing on subjectivity are always accompanied\nby the dialectical complement of worldly realization. Bloch\u2019s\nmysticism\u2014as well as his ontology\u2014was thus always\npolitical, it is used to stage the existential presence of the\nforthcoming freedom.\n\nThe world Bloch wants to liberate is the world of capitalist\nestrangement, which, in his Marxist phase, is also described as a\nmeaningless \u201chollow space\u201d. In it, the conflicts are due\nto the inherently unjust, class based social structure and private\nproperty. In the classless kingdom of the future, based on\n\u201cmorals without property\u201d (GA 15: 188), neither nature nor\ntechnology will be alienated from or alienating for humans (Bloch also\nexplores an emancipatory potential in technological utopias). The\nprevailing attitude would then be that of affectedness\n(Betroffenheit) (GA 9: 56).\n\nBloch\u2019s commitment to Marxism is visible already in his early\nwork (it is present in The Spirit of Utopia), but was never\northodox. The urge to emancipation, the critical perspective on the\nhuman social praxis, and the focus on the laboring individual as the\nmajor motor of history were the elements of Marxist doctrine Bloch was\nmostly keen to adopt. Indeed, only after Marx, Bloch believed, utopia\nbecame \u201cconcrete\u201d. Bloch\u2019s major theoretical\nproposal was to complement what he termed \u201ccold stream\u201d in\nMarxism (analysis of objective social conditions) with the \u201cwarm\nstream\u201d of utopian \u201csurplus\u201d. Bloch was thus\ncriticizing the lack of a normative and imaginative dimension in\nMarxist philosophy. His ultimate aim was not to find its way into\nMarxism, but rather to locate, in an Hegelian fashion, Marxist ideas\nin a broader realm of utopian thought.\n3.2 Ethics\n\nEarly Bloch re-interprets Kantian postulates\u2014immortality,\nfreedom, and existence of God\u2014as utopias (GA Erg. Bd.: 318;\nBloch 1918 [2000: 179]) and thus gives ethics an ontological meaning,\nstresses the normativity of being, which itself becomes a promise of\nutopia (see Schiller 1982, Tegtmeyer 2012). The very idea of the\nutopian is, for the early Bloch, immediately apparent (Riedel 1994:\n139 calls his position ethical intuitionism) and normative at\nthe same time, while Kantian \u201cthing in itself\u201d is\nreinterpreted as \u201cobjective phantasy\u201d, that is, creative\nanticipation (1969 [GA 10: 133]; Bloch 1918 [2000: 201]).\nKant\u2019s imperative is important for Bloch insofar as \u201cthe\nmoral As If really appears\u201d there \u201cas a theological Not\nYet\u201d (Bloch 1918 [2000: 177]).\n\nBloch rethinks the idea of revolutionary violence and, in his early\nwork, suggests that in a state of exception, that is, in fighting the\ninjustice of authority, the non-action can represent a bigger evil\nthan a violent resistance. He thus offers another attempt\u2014a\nparallel to the one suggested by Luk\u00e1cs\u2014of moral\nlegitimization of revolutionary violence and of a politicization of\nethics, calling it \u201ca categorical imperative with revolver in\nhand\u201d (Bloch 1918 [2000: 242]). The community perspective is\nimportant here: for Bloch, in certain historical periods,\nnon-resistance to evil can be contagious and debilitating, and\nBloch\u2019s M\u00fcntzer condemns the passivity precisely because of\nthe present lack of universal emancipation (1921 [GA 2: 174]). In\nThe Principle of Hope, Bloch develops this idea in a\nquestionable hierarchization of ideals and suggests that\n\u201clower\u201d ideas could be temporarily sacrificed in view of\nthe highest one, the classless society (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a:\n173]). However, elsewhere Bloch retreats from this radicalism and, in\ncriticizing Pashukanis\u2019 Marxist theory of law claims that \n\n\nit is not a matter of finding a substitute for morals, such as turning\nthe struggle for a better society itself into a morality and saying\nthat morality is only a tautology for this struggle, or that this\nstruggle is the only authentic one. (Bloch 1961 [1986b: 241]; see\nRiedel 1994) \n\n\nGenerally, Bloch\u2019s critical utopian posture, his belief that the\nfoundations of morality cannot be fully evident and fully sublated by\nthe overarching totalizing political goal (as early Luk\u00e1cs\nbelieved), something that Bloch thematizes as a fundamental obscurity\nof the human soul, functioned as a counterweight to moral absolutism\nin his ethical thinking.\n3.3 Theory of History and Non-Contemporaneity\n\nApplied to the social and political realm, the dynamic ontological\nvision of Bloch\u2019s philosophy makes it particularly focused on\ntemporality and non-identity: in the world of the Not-Yet, what\nmatters is the still unfulfilled promises (heritage) of the past, and\nthe unrealized possibilities awaiting the society in the future.\nBloch\u2019s vision of history is built on the idea of its open-ended\nprocessuality and heterogeneity of historical time\u2014something\nthat brings Bloch quite close to Walter\n Benjamin.[5]\n Indeed, Bloch criticized a linear model of historical progress as\nearly as his dissertation (Mendes-Flohr 1983; Pelletier 2019).\n\nThis view is most pronounced in Heritage of Our Times, the\nbook, in which Bloch developed a theory of non-contemporaneity (or\nnon-synchronicity, Ungleichzeitigkeit) claiming that various\ntemporalities can co-exist within one historical\n period[6]\n and that past consciousness and being can still be present in the\npresent (Rabinbach 1977; Dietschy 2012). This theory captures the\nheterogeneity of historical time and emphasizes the unsettled elements\nof the past as promises of yet unrealized\npossibilities\u2014something Bloch also paradigmatically develops in\nhis book on Thomas M\u00fcntzer. There, he develops the idea of\nactualization\u2014another name of\n\u201cself-encounter\u201d or affectedness\u2014 whereby the\nconcepts and the figures of history re-emerge on the scene to fulfill\nthe revolutionary promise.\n\nThe synchronicity of the non-synchronous is opposed to the linear\ndevelopmental vision of history that took shape in the Enlightenment.\nBloch\u2019s idea helps relativize this vision of progress. The\nheterogeneity of historical time gives voices to the plurality of\nhistorical temporalities, including non-Western societies. It is\nconnected to the fundamental non-identity of individual experience: an\nindividual is never contemporaneous to herself. Various social\nformations\u2014such as nations, geographical regions, classes, or\ninstitutional logics\u2014could be non-contemporaneous as\nsuch\u2014and to each other. Various non-contemporaneous elements\ncould both block the work of emancipation and help revitalize it after\nits alleged defeat. Non-contemporaneity is the proper concept for the\nutopian vision of society, permeated by revolutionary\ndiscontinuities.\n\nBloch\u2019s theory of modernity developed in Heritage of our\nTimes aims to explain the success of Nazi ideology by\ndemonstrating how it could incorporate the suppressed\nnon-contemporaneous elements (the ideas of a nation or kingdom\n[Reich]). By suggesting, in his review of\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019 History and Class Consciousness, to\nmove, in Marxist dialectics, from the concept of totality to the\nconcepts of a sphere (GA 10), Bloch in fact tries to rethink the\nsocial analysis as a conglomerate of heterogenous temporalities that,\nhowever, interact with, oppose, and constitute each other. At times,\nhe appears to wish to overcome the non-contemporaneity in the vision\nof a true presence, which should be utopian and dialectically mediated\nby the future: \n\n\n[C]ontemporaneity is not such if it is not also super-contemporaneous;\nit is not the capitalist of the uncontrolled, changeable Today who\nstands at par with the real present but only the knower and controller\nof the Tomorrow in the Today together, in short, the active Marxist.\n(Bloch 1935 [1991: 195f.]) \n\n\nBloch\u2019s ideal of super-contemporaneity thus means embracing the\nintensity of the future in the present.\n\nIn the fight against the new conservatism, the non-contemporaneous\nsocial groups\u2014urban bourgeoisie, white-collar workers, peasants,\nyouth\u2014should play a specific role, often overlooked by textbook\nversions of historical materialism that only focused on the conflict\nbetween capitalists and industrial workers. Bloch criticizes the\nnarrow economistic version of historical materialism already in the\nbook on M\u00fcntzer, by making recourse to Max Weber. In Heritage\nof Our Times, he argues that German fascists could exploit the\nanti-capitalist utopian tendencies in these social strata and\nre-function them in their conservative political propaganda, thus\nmobilizing the energy of the non-contemporaneity, which should be\nregained by the more inclusive\n left.[7]\n\nBloch thus criticized overly positivist tendencies in Marxism (what\nLenin dubbed \u201cstupid materialism\u201d, see on that Levitas\n2012) that tended to dismiss all kinds of \u201cirrational\u201d\nelements precisely at the point where and when it was critical to\nengage with them. The same happens in capitalist society, where these\nelements tend to be repressed by the capitalist\n\u201ccontemporaneity\u201d. In co-opting them, Bloch follows the\nbasic dialectical strategy, forging a new synthesis with the\nother\u2014with something heterogeneous to capitalist or Marxist\nrationality. The promises and claims from the past serve both as\nexplanatory elements and as normative justifications for the new\npractical engagement with the \u201cheritage\u201d Bloch finds so\ncrucial.\n 3.4 Bloch on Natural Law\n\nOne particularly important case in this work of actualization is\nBloch\u2019s analysis of natural law, a legal dimension of utopian\npractical philosophy (Wagner 1995). The tradition of natural law as\nsomething more fundamental than statist legal structures, is going\nback to antiquity, but also to such scholars as Christian Thomasius\nand, for Bloch, to the values of the French revolution. What mostly\ninterests Bloch is the political dimension of the natural law\ndoctrine, its role for the critique of the positive law, its\ngrassroots nature, its focus on individual freedom, dignity, and\nrights of a citizen (in contrast to the pursuit of happiness\ncharacteristic for social utopias), as something to be fought for and\ndefended.\n\nWithin Marxism, Bloch reinstates the importance of human rights that\nare not inborn, but are something to fight for and uphold. He makes\nthem as necessary for the left political cause as the end of\nexploitation (Bloch 1961 [1986b: xxix]). Following his ontological\nbeliefs, Bloch does not wish to inherit the ahistorical ideas of human\nnature or some fixed universal principles. What remains an historical\ninvariant of the natural law tradition, for Bloch, is a drive towards\nfreedom (Gramm 1990). The essence of natural law is the idea of human\ndignity, captured in a metaphor of \u201cupright walk\u201d. The\ncontent or the foundation of dignity is the openness and the ability\nto transcend the frames of one\u2019s class or any other fixed\nposition in the social world. In the class society, positive law and\nstate are, for Bloch, instruments of domination.\n\nBloch\u2019s utopian ideal is thus natural law, but not positive law,\nthat would necessarily be misused by the ruling class; and it is an\nutopian humanistic community of dignity and love, existing beyond the\nstate. Note that Bloch\u2019s humanism is not built on the idea of an\nimmutable and immediately and intuitively given human nature. On the\ncontrary, he emphasizes that the true meaning of the human can only be\nanticipated and posited as an aim of history (Bloch 1961 [1986b:\n192]). Liberty, equality and fraternity are the utopian ideals of\nhuman individual and communitarian praxis that is in the process of\nseeking its most adequate\n realization.[8]\n3.5 Utopian Philosophy of Religion\n\nPerhaps the most poignant formula characterizing Bloch\u2019s general\nattitude toward religion is \u201ctranscending without any heavenly\ntranscendence\u201d (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 1288])\u2014or\n\u201ctranscending into the this-worldly\u201d (Transzendieren\nins Diesseits, see Traub & Wieser 1975: 234). This\n\u201chorizontal\u201d transcending (Agar 2014) is predicated upon\nthe utopian anticipation, the premonition of the ideal state, of the\nfull adequacy of the subject and the object. God is thus expected as a\nfuture utopian human kingdom, while religion is a necessary bearer of\nemancipatory utopian drive.\n\nThe openness to the future is something associated with the messianic\nmoment of Bloch\u2019s philosophy. The coming of the radically new\nmust meet the humans who prepare it and practically work towards its\nrealization. The general sentiment visible in the prophetic style of\nBloch\u2019s first writings is that of a tense anticipation of a\nradical revolutionary upheaval and of \u201ccommunist-apostolic\nkingdom of Christ\u201d (1921 [GA 2: 53]) coming. In fact, in\nBloch\u2019s early thinking, shaped by the feelings of deep social\nand cultural crisis, eschatology is a binding force of the whole human\nhistory.\n\nSince the state as an hierarchical and violent institution, new forms\nof community, or \u201cfraternal inwardness\u201d (Bloch 1918\n[2000: 161]), are called for. The Spirit of Utopia ends with\nthe invocation of the utopian community (indeed, the\n\u201cinconstruable question\u201d is a question on\n\u201cus\u201d)\u2014the community, on which God\u2019s own\nrealization in history is dependent, while T\u00fcbingen\nIntroduction to Philosophy begins with the formula that stages\nthe becoming of community out of mere individual being and the feeling\nof subjective\n lack.[9]\n Note that Bloch was skeptical towards the aesthetization of the\npolitical and the synthesis of an ethical and aesthetic genius in a\nsingle political figure of violence and domination. The function of\nthe spiritual leaders, the agents of creativity, is not to impose\ntheir genius on others, but to open up an anticipatory space of\nredemption (die Sache selbst, GA 10: 209) and share with the\nutopian community the practices and possibilities of this\nincompleteness, a yet \u201chidden human face\u201d (GA 10: 210) of\nan individual.\n\nThe political media of utopia for Bloch were the anarchist religious\nmovements that tried to emancipate themselves from the authorities of\nthe state and the church, to revolutionize existing institutions, and\nto establish new forms of democratic solidarity. This refusal to take\nthe world as it is, the political energy of utopia, is opposed not\nonly to conformist tendencies in Catholicism, but also to Calvinism\nhelping establish \u201ccapitalism as religion\u201d (1921 [GA 2:\n123]) and to Luther\u2019s Protestantism that repressed any social\nengagement and, in the irrationalism and quietism of its pure passive\ninwardness, fetishized the given political order. The mystical hiatus\nbetween action and redemption, between human creatures and\ntranscendent grace, and the projection of all the real agency on God\nstifled the work of emancipation.\n\nIn Atheism in Christianity, Bloch (1968 [2009]) consistently\ndemonstrates the entanglement of the political dominance of the ruling\nclass and intellectual dominance of religious doctrines. He thus\nfollows Nietzsche in exposing the political dimension of theocracy.\nHowever, his key argument remains that all the religions contain an\nutopian heretic core\u2014something Bloch calls Exodus\u2014that\nreveals the true meaning of religion: the emancipatory drive to throw\ndown the political and intellectual hegemony of the ruling class.\nBloch\u2019s key insight is to demonstrate that this drive is\nessential for the philosophy that emphasizes anticipation of the\nfuture and hope and for that, a non-dogmatic religious myth is a\nlegitimate ally. The revolutionary figure of Jesus is treated in view\nof its human dimension: Christ is a prophet of this world,\n\u201cmessianic kingdom of God\u2014without God\u201d (Bloch\n1954\u201359 [1986a: 1200]). Just as the Marxist orthodoxy could not\nsee any potential in romanticism and avant-garde, and thus failed\npolitically, Enlightenment, with its sweeping critique of religion,\nwent too far and discarded its own emancipatory core with the bath\nwater. Bloch, inspired by Feuerbach, but also by the gnostic sentiment\nof his earlier work, focuses on the not-yet-revealed Judeo-Christian\nGod of Exodus as a liberating figure and on the heroes of the\nScripture (such as Job), who discover \u201cthe processual God\u201d\n(Bielik-Robson 2019).\n\n\nDespite his atheism, something he espoused from the very\n beginning,[10]\n Bloch stated explicitly the link between hope and religion (GA Erg.\nBd.: 347), and some theologians saw in his philosophy of hope a\ncommitment to liberated version of Christianity that would accept the\nGod as an immanent eschatological force (see especially Moltmann 1964\n[1967], who puts eschatology at the center of theological discourse\nand defines its major object in essentially Blochian terms: to capture\nthe future within the present) (see also Moylan 1997).\n4. Aesthetics\n\nWorks of art, in Bloch\u2019s interpretation, are perfect examples of\nutopian objects, in that they always transcend their immediate\nmeanings and contexts and serve as non-contemporaneous indications of\nunrealized possibilities (Korstvedt 2010). They are the perfect\nembodiments of the highest happiness and intensive openness to the new\n(Holz 1975), and an artistic genius is the most proper medium of the\nnot-yet-conscious (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 122f.]). Works of art\nthus both embody the incompleteness of the world and mediate an\naesthetic experience that is, in its epistemic role, a primary vehicle\nof grasping the utopian, the radically new, by the human mind (Vidal\n1994). The term Bloch mostly used for characterizing art is\nVor-Schein (pre-appearance, sometimes also translated as\nanticipatory illumination), drawing on the classic idea of aesthetic\nappearance (Schein), which has the meaning of illusion or\nfiction. So art is not \u201cmere\u201d illusion, but an utopian\nanticipation. Thus, a perfect work of art is always imperfect, is\ncompleteness is complete because it is incomplete, that is, because it\ncontains within itself the fullness of the Not Yet.\n\nArt is\u2014like the world itself\u2014a laboratory, in which the\ninner and the outer interact and exchange identities (Hudson 1982)\nthus overcoming the narrowness of private experience and the\nestrangement of objectified cultural forms. It is inherently utopian\nprecisely because it sublimates the sensuous by staying sensuous,\nbecause it elevates the empirical reality by making the ideal happen\nin a sensuous form, and because it is an important medium of\nimagination. The productivity of an artist, their creative drive, is\nfor Bloch connected to the experience of lack in the actual present\n(\u201csomething\u2019s missing\u201d), and is directed towards the\nfuture absolute, the full adequacy of subject and object.\n\nTropes as media of reference are for Bloch instruments for\ncomprehending the unsettled reality and indicating its future\npossibilities, the mirrors of not-yet-become (GA 9: 293)\u2014be it\nin putting various phenomena together in view of a common telos (as in\nthe case of symbols) or in creating an irreducible multiplicity of\nreferences (as in the case of allegories). In producing the new by\ncombining heterogenous elements, these techniques are \n\n\na form of materialist cognition \u2026 designed to reveal traces of\nworld contents not given in the abstract appearance of capitalist\nsociety. (Hudson 1982: 2) \n\n\nBloch\u2019s philosophy of nature leads him to re-evaluate the\nconcept of the beauty in nature. Since the nature itself is utopian,\nit does its own creative work and is permeated by \u201creal\u201d\ntropes pertaining to its future potentialities.\n\nMusic, for Bloch, provides us with \u201cthe utopian sound of [\u2026]\nexistence\u201d (Bloch 1985d: 212) in the most immediately graspable way.\nMusic is both dynamic and material, following Bloch\u2019s vision of\nnature. It creates the way to comprehend an essential reality,\na fulfilled moment, the absolute, to externalize the pure inwardness,\nwhat in The Spirit of Utopia coincides with\n\u201cself-encounter\u201d (which Bloch also conjures by referring\nto Expressionist art) and is later extended to the whole of humanity\nencountering itself. Music is paradigmatically incomplete,\nnon-discursive, ineffable, and is the source of inexhaustible novelty\nand variability, a realm, in which the utopian, the future in the\npast, should be heard. Importantly, music is created and perceived in\nthe darkness of the lived moment and affects the subjectivity in the\nmost direct and profound way, by dynamizing it, bringing it into\nmotion.\n\nMusic begins as \u201csinging-to-oneself\u201d, which is conceived\nas an analogy to the darkness of the lived moment that should be\novercome in the further dialectical progression of musical formations,\nor categories. The general pattern of this progression is gradual\nemancipation from immediate practical entanglements of the\n\u201ctone\u201d, the dialectics playing out between human\nexpression and objective form, between the material/emotional, and the\ntechnical (Korstvedt 2010). This interplay was first conceived by\nBloch in his analysis of the ornament in The Spirit of Utopia\nwhile juxtaposing the Egyptian art as a dead, merely external form and\na Gothic art, in which the human dimension becomes prominent. In\nThe Principle of Hope, Bloch further emphasizes the social\nconditioning and direct social influence of music, its powers to\ntransgress the context, to which it most immediately relates (Levitas\n2013). The dialectic of the material and the ideal in\n tone,[11]\n unlike in Hegel\u2019s philosophy of music Bloch largely follows, is\nnot fully resolved in the overarching subjectivity of spirit but keeps\nreproducing a tension and a productive utopian indeterminacy (Gallope\n2017).\n\nAn important feature of Bloch\u2019s aesthetics is the focus on the\nsmall, seemingly insignificant, and on the mundane (Jameson 1971): in\nThe Spirit of Utopia, he praises applied art and crafts;\nlater, while working a lot as a cultural critic, he turns to popular\nculture, in particular, fairy tales, adventure stories and detective\nnovels. The Principle of Hope, besides being a work in\nphilosophy, is also an encyclopedia of utopian motives in visual art,\narchitecture, but also in all genres of literature, popular culture,\nmythology, and everyday life. Bloch was practicing utopian\nhermeneutics in discovering the potentialities in various aesthetic\nforms and exploring the aspects of poetic non-contemporaneity in\ncertain works of art that get re-actualized in different historical\ncontexts, and in literary characters (such as Don Quixote), who\nexemplify the utopian transgression.\n\nIn the detective novel, the small details are crucial, as well as the\ndarkness of the lived moment (GA 9: 247, 260, see Bloch 1965 [1998]),\na fundamental obscurity of the crime that is driving the\ninvestigation. It is crucial for Bloch that this obscurity is not\nmerely something that should be elucidated epistemically. It is rather\nstill unclear to itself, like in the story of Oedipus (Bloch also\nconceded to psychoanalysis its role as hermeneutics of suspicion). The\nwhole world is thus becoming this investigation into its own obscure\norigins, while the detective hermeneutics\u2014including the one\npracticed by Benjamin\u2014becomes the major epistemological\nstrategy.\n\nFairy tale is for Bloch a genre that represents a victory over the\nstiflingly static mythical powers, its imagination is emancipatory and\nis directed at the future happiness (GA 9: 131), its general optimist\nhopeful attitude is recognized as that of an rational Enlightenment\nautonomy (Weissberg 1992). Popular literature of the\n \u201ccolportage\u201d[12]\n (particularly Karl May) was important for Bloch because of its\ndemocratic tendency, its grassroots nature, and its genuine wish for\nthe new, its dream for revolution (Edwards 2013). Romanticism was also\nre-functioned in view of its anti-bourgeois pathos. Following\nBloch\u2019s political philosophy, the elements of the conservative\nGerman culture\u2014from Hebel (Siebers 2011) to Wagner (Korstvedt\n2010)\u2014should also be saved.\n\nBloch\u2019s intellectual strategy became especially salient in the\ndebates on expressionism, an important aesthetic discussion of the\n1930s. Bloch argued, against Luk\u00e1cs, that in the hollow world\nof the contemporaneous capitalism, the avant-garde is the genuine\naesthetic achievement (Schmitt 1973; Ujma 1995). He insisted on the\nopenness and discontinuity of the true works of art, which he defended\nspeculatively already in The Spirit of Utopia (Riedel 1994),\nand focused on a fragment as a technique that conveys an inherently\nutopian potential. The aesthetic attitude propagated by Bloch, the\ndiscontinuous, shocking, estranging intervention in reality\u2014such\nas the technique of montage, or anacoluthon, a sudden\ninterruption in the flow of narrative\u2014is for him a true realism,\na mimesis faithful to a ubiquitous utopian surplus of the world,\nperformatively activating this surplus.\n",
