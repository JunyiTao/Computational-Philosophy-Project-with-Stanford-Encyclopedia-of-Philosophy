    "main_text": "Physics and Theology || The Practical Side of Natural Philosophy\n5.1 The Practical Side of Natural Philosophy\n\nSeneca\u2019s Natural Questions consist of eight books on\nmeteorology. Two recent publications argue forcefully for a revised\norder to the books: 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 6, 7, 1 and 2. Harry Hine\u2019s\ntranslation is the first edition to print the books in this order\n(2010), and Gareth Williams argues that this is the most likely\nintended sequence in which the books should be read (2012).\n\nToday\u2019s readers tend to show little enthusiasm when they turn to\nthe Natural Questions. What are we to think of long\ndiscussions about clouds, rain, lights in the sky, lightning and\nthunder, wind, comets, and earthquakes, combined with detailed\ntreatments of terrestrial waters and, specifically, the Nile? Why does\nSeneca devote so much time to these phenomena? Scholars read the\nNatural Questions against the background of the\nmeteorological tradition, a long-standing genre. Seneca, it is argued,\nengages in a project that is rather well established (Graver 2000, 45\nand 51). Different contributions to this genre share a common goal.\nThe rational explanation of natural phenomena will change the way we\nlive in the world. To take a simple example: a person who understands\nthe workings of thunder and lightning is not going to think that Zeus\nis sending her the message that he is angry. As Graver points out, at\nthe time when Seneca writes the Natural Questions, this kind\nof concern is most prominently associated with Epicurean philosophy\n(2000, 51). Epicurean physics is in the business of fighting\nsuperstition and fear. The person who thinks that Zeus is speaking to\nher through the weather is in turmoil; the person who understands how\nthe elements interact can live a more rational and better life. Now, a\nStoic philosopher writing on these matters faces a challenge.\nEpicureans argue that God does not concern himself with the\nparticulars of human life to the extent of signaling to us that a\ncertain action of ours did not meet his approval. The Stoic God,\nhowever, is caring, benevolent, and concerned with the details of\nhuman life. Thus, the fear that easily attaches to meteorological\nphenomena must be fought with nothing but the detail of physical\nanalysis. The argument that God would not care to send us signs is\nunavailable: the Stoic God, and Seneca agrees on this, is in principle\nsuch as to send us signs, which is why divination counts as a science\n(cf. 2.32\u201351 on lightning and divination; Williams 2012, chapter\n8; on Seneca\u2019s reaction to Epicureanism, see Graver 2015).\n\nUltimately, the project of the Natural Questions is to\n\u201ctake measure of God\u201d (1.17), to \u201cwalk through the\nuniverse\u201d (mundum circuire; 3.1), to celebrate the\nworks of the gods (3.5), and to free us from fear induced by natural\nevents (6.4). The study of clouds or thunderstorms is interesting\nbecause we want to understand how clouds or thunderstorms\narise\u2014but more than that, it must be salutary (2.59.2), and it\nhelps us achieve human excellence (3.10\u201318) (Inwood, 2005 [8];\non the relationship of ethics and physics, cf. I. Hadot, 1969,\n111\u2013117). Seneca pursues a long-standing concern with making\nnature less scary, thus approaching meteorology partly from an ethical\nperspective. Moreover, the Natural Questions contain a number\nof discussions of human beings who act in what Seneca sees as\nparticularly sordid and depraved ways. These passages are often\ndescribed as digressions. Another reading, put forward by Williams\n(2012, Chapter 2), characterizes the Natural Questions as\ngoing beyond the meteorological tradition precisely because the text\nis in this particular way colorful, imaginative, and dramatic.\nWilliams argues that Seneca\u2019s treatise is importantly an\nartistic engagement with nature. Seneca aims to make some of his\npoints by contrasting the beauty of nature\u2019s workings with the\nugliness of vicious action.\n\nSeneca\u2019s study of nature is importantly about a human\nbeing\u2019s place and standing within the world. How could a person\nnot investigate nature, knowing that \u2018all this\u2019\u2014the\nworld\u2014pertains to her (ad se pertinere; Natural\nQuestions 1.13)? Seneca\u2019s cosmopolitanism is integral to\nthe way he leads his readers into the study of nature. Only when we\nview our local lives from the perspective of the stars do we come to\nsee the insignificance of riches, borders, and so on (NQ\n1.9\u201313). In an influential phrase, Pierre Hadot calls this\nperspective the \u2018view from above\u2019 (1995)\u2014a view that\nliberates us insofar as we come to see many seemingly important issues\nas mere trifles. We need the study of nature in order to reach the\nkind of distance from our everyday concerns that eventually frees us\nfrom unreasonable concern for them. And we investigate nature as\nsomething that we are a part of. In agreement with early Stoic thought\nabout the universe as a large living being with parts, Seneca thinks\nthat we are rightly motivated to study nature\u2014nature is the\nlarge entity of which we are parts. Natural philosophy thus is\nnecessary for fully engaging with one\u2019s life. We might note that\nSeneca contrasts the study of nature with the study of history; for\nhim, it is the seemingly more theoretical field of physics that has\ngreater practical value. It is better to praise the gods than to\npraise the conquests of Philip or Alexander (NQ 3.5).\nFurther, the study of nature is particularly valuable because it is\nthe study of what should happen (quid faciendum\nsit), as opposed to the study of what in fact did happen\n(quid factum) (NQ 3.7).\n",
