    "main_text": "Ethics\n5. Ethics\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s ethics is a form of perfectionism, resembling the\nrationalist perfectionism of Christian Wolff\u2019s ethics but also\nsignificantly departing from it in ways that echo Mendelssohn\u2019s\nappreciation of aesthetic and affective dimensions of moral life. In\nthe fourth and final part of his Prize Essay, Mendelssohn investigates\nthe extent of evidence in the foundational principles of ethics\n(Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Sittenlehre) and, in particular, how\nit compares to evidence (\u201cthe certainty and\ncomprehensibility\u201d) of geometry\u2019s basic principles. He\nintroduces the discussion with the observation that when someone\nundertakes the right sort of action, that person \u201ctacitly\u201d\nmakes the following \u201crational inference,\u201d a moral\nsyllogism in the form of a modus ponens:\n\n\nMajor premise: \u201cWhere the property A is encountered, my duty\nrequires me to do B.\u201d\n\nMinor premise: \u201cThe present case has the property A.\u201d\n\n\nThe major premise is a \u201cmaxim, a general rule of living,\u201d\nassumed at some other point and remembered on the present occasion.\nThe minor premise is based \u201cupon an exact observation of the\npresent circumstances and on the conviction that they fully agree with\nrequisite properties A.\u201d As in mathematics, the doctrine of\nmorals divides into two parts, the theoretical (instructional) and the\npractical (applied), where the former conveys the general rules of\nliving that serve as the major premises and the latter their\napplication in a particular case. Mendelssohn submits that it is not\ndifficult to prove \u201cwith geometric rigor and trenchancy\u201d\nthe general principles of ethics, i.e., the rational principles that\nprescribe what to do and to leave undone. Nothing is clearer or more\ncompelling, he observes, than Marcus Aurelius\u2019 conclusion that\nthese principles follow from what is common to us as rational\ncreatures. Because human beings have a common power of making value\njudgments (Beurtheilungskraft), all their judgments about\ngood and evil rest upon the same ground, diverging from one another\nonly to the degree that their insight does. There are accordingly\n\u201cuniversal ground-rules\u201d (what Mendelssohn also dubs\n\u201claws of nature\u201d) according to which human beings are\nsupposed to decide what to do and leave undone. Moving freely between\nthe singular and the plural in this regard, Mendelssohn refers without\nqualification to both \u201cthis universal law of nature\u201d and\n\u201claws of nature,\u201d but this looseness can probably be\nattributed to the fact that he entertains three ways of proving and\nthus articulating \u201cthe first law of nature.\u201d\n\nThe first proof is based upon observation. To determine these\nuniversal laws of nature, one need only observe what human beings do\nand leave undone, their various inclinations and passions, and single\nout what they all aim for. What all the desires and wishes, passions\nand inclinations have in common is the pursuit of \u201cthe\npreservation or betterment of our inner or outer condition or that of\nanother creature.\u201d Both those who are virtuous and those who are\nridden with vices aim at perfection, true or illusory, a perfection\nunderstood as the preservation or betterment of their inner or outer\nstate or that of others. From this universal pursuit the first law of\nnature flows, namely, \u201cmake your inner and outer state and that\nof others, in proper proportion, as perfect as you can.\u201d Duties\nto oneself, others, and to God can be derived from this first law.\n(The argument is short on details, to be sure, supposing as it does a\nuniversality and essentialness not afforded without further ado by\nobservation alone.)\n\nThe second proof establishes the same basic law but does so \u201ca\npriori\u201d on the basis of the \u201cmere definition\u201d of an\nentity with free will. The choices made by such an entity are based\nupon what it finds pleasing, namely, \u201cthe perfection, beauty,\nand order\u201d that it perceives or believes that it perceives in\nthe preferred objects. With their unmistakably aesthetic accent, these\nqualities serve as \u201cmotivating grounds\u201d\n(Bewegungsgr\u00fcnde) to act or refrain from acting. Without\nbeing physically coercive, these motivating grounds entail an\n\u201cobligatoriness\u201d or \u201cmoral necessity,\u201d since\nno free spirit could enjoy the opposite of them. This proof has been\nrecently challenged in at least two, complementary ways (Klemme 293).\nFirst, if a free, rational person necessarily chooses to act in\naccordance with her knowledge of good and evil, how can she be\nrequired to perfect herself? Second, why is the law normative and not\nmerely descriptive? These are significant objections but they arguably\nsuppose positions that neither Mendelssohn, the proponent of common\nsense, nor Mendelssohn, the metaphysician, can countenance. By\nunderscoring the imperfection but also the corrigibility of reasonable\npeople, common sense insures the meaningfulness of the injunction to\nself-perfection. From a metaphysical description of the basis\n(motivations, ends) of a rational choice, normative constraints follow\nfor making precisely those sorts of choices.\n\nThe third proof of this universal law of nature is based upon its\nagreement with the final purpose of creation. From the assumption of a\ncreator of the world who acts with wisest of intentions, it follows\nthat promotion of the perfection of the creation must be God\u2019s\nwill. To be sure, might never makes right and Mendelssohn accordingly\nstresses that law is a consequence not of divine power but of the\nright of a divine will. Nonetheless, from (i) the fact that God can\nonly want what is best and (ii) the fact that \u201ca right is\nnothing other than a moral capacity to do what conforms to the rule of\nperfection,\u201d it follows that God possesses the right to\nprescribe to his creation laws that are necessarily rules of its\nperfection. This third proof arguably represents a further departure\nfrom Wolff who rejects the equivalence of the natural law with a\ndivine command. For Wolff, only someone lacking reason has need of\nmotivations other than natural obligatoriness (Klemme 295f).\n\nSumming up these three proofs, Mendelssohn lists three basic maxims\nthat lead to the same conclusion. Whether we (1) consider what is\ncommon to all human inclinations, (2) recognize ourselves as entities\nendowed with free wills, or (3) acknowledge that we are God\u2019s\ncreation, \u201call three maxims lead to the common conclusion:\nperfect yourself and others.\u201d\n\nMendelssohn employs the expression \u201cright of nature\u201d\n(Naturrecht) to designate the sum of the laws of natural\nright resulting from the application of these rational principles to\nindividual cases. Given this one universal law of nature, the concepts\nof moral philosophy are sufficiently connected with one another to\nmake up a theoretical system and it is possible to develop \u201call\nour duties, rights, and obligations\u201d from that natural law. The\nresult is a moral philosophy as certain as metaphysics, namely, a\n\u201cscience of the qualities [Beschaffenheiten] of an\nentity with free will.\u201d At the same time, he contends that the\nderivation, not only of the universal natural law, but also of various\nmaxims from it (\u201cLove virtue,\u201d \u201ccontrol your\npassions\u201d) is as certain as any geometric proof. Yet, unlike\ngeometry, ethics is about human action and this science is, moreover,\n\u201cerected on the grounds of metaphysics,\u201d in particular,\nthe metaphysical doctrines of God, the world, and the human soul.\nHence, evidence in moral philosophy is necessarily even more difficult\nto obtain than in metaphysics. While the foundational principles of\nethics can be proven with the same certainty (Gewissheit) as\nthose of geometry, it is not on the same level with respect to its\nability to be comprehended (Fasslichkeit). Unlike geometry,\nethics supposes the comprehension of those metaphysical truths.\n\nAs for applied ethics, it is in the same position as any other\npractical science in that its degree of certainty is dependent upon\ncontingent and unknown circumstances as well as upon actions\u2019\neffects that cannot be foreseen with certainty. The minor premise of\nthe practical syllogism, determining what we should do in practice,\ni.e., in the case before us, runs through all levels of probability.\nThen, too, there is the possibility that the obligatoriness of some\nhigher-level duty stands in the way of the application of a\nlower-level duty but that, given the situation, this fact escapes\n\u201cthe sharpest attention.\u201d Indeed, what mortal, Mendelssohn\nasks, can be certain that his action is the best that he can do? In\nmost cases, \u201cconscience and a fortunate sense for the truth\n(bon-sens)\u201d must stand in for reason. Like taste in\nregard to beauty and its opposite, conscience and a sense for truth\nare capacities, developed over time, of correctly distinguishing good\nand evil, true and false respectively without the benefit of extensive\nreflection and on the basis of inferences that are less than clear.\nDespite the fogginess of its inferences, \u201cthis inner\nfeeling,\u201d this sense for the good and the true, acts on us\naccording to universal principles that, through constant practice,\nhave been incorporated into our temperament and accordingly influence\nour desires far more than the clearest rational inferences that may\nconvince but fail to stir us. Coupled with the acknowledgment of the\nlack of the appropriate distinct concepts for the particular\napplication, this recourse to conscience as a feeling suggests a\nfurther sharp break with the rationalism of Wolff and his followers\n(Klemme 298f).\n\nBy way of introducing the last segment of this discussion of evidence\nin ethics, Mendelssohn distinguishes theoretical and practical forms\nof approval. While it is impossible to doubt what is a matter of\nintellectual conviction, it is possible for us to act contrary to an\nobligation that we are convinced of. So, too, some truths are\nintellectually convincing but do not move us, whereas other, less\ncertain truths do so, producing \u201clively and efficacious\u201d\ncognition, passing over into the faculty of desire, and even\nmotivating decisions. The familiar reason for this discrepancy in the\nefficaciousness of truths is, Mendelssohn, submits, the recalcitrance\nof inclinations to reason. Approval of a truth becomes practical if\nthe rational principles either gain the upper hand over inclinations\nor put them to its advantage. Mendelssohn identifies ethics\u2019\nfour means of securing the agreement of reason and desire: (1)\nincreasing the number of motivations, (2) practice and habit, (3)\nadding pleasant sensations (for which art and literature are\nparticularly useful), and (4) examples that have been observed or can\nbe intuited (e.g., history, Aesop\u2019s fables).\n",
