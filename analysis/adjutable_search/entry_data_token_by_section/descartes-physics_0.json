A Brief History of Descartes\u2019 Scientific Work\n\nDespite his fame as a philosopher of purely metaphysical problems,\nsuch as the relation of the soul and body, or God\u2019s existence,\nit would not be incorrect to conclude that Descartes was a scientist\nfirst and a philosopher second. Not only did Descartes\u2019 interest\nand work in science extend throughout his entire scholarly career, but\nsome of his most important metaphysical works (e.g., the\nMeditations) were prompted by a perceived need to equip his\nscience with a metaphysical foundation that would be acceptable to the\nAristotelian-influenced Scholastics. Yet, one must be careful not to\nimpose modern conceptions on the \u201cnatural philosophy\u201d of\nearlier centuries, for much seventeenth century science was\npractically indistinguishable from the more speculative metaphysics of\nthe era (and thus the label \u201cnatural philosophy\u201d is\nparticularly apt for describing seventeenth century science). In fact,\nmuch of Descartes\u2019 science is only part of a much larger system\nthat embraces all areas of philosophical investigation, including both\nhis physics and metaphysics.\n\nThe awakening of Descartes\u2019 interest in physics is often dated\nto late 1618, when Descartes first met Isaac Beeckman, an amateur\nscientist and mathematician who championed the new\n\u201cmechanical\u201d philosophy. The mechanical philosophy\u2019s\nexplanation of natural phenomena, which Descartes quickly adopted,\nrejected the use of Scholastic substantial forms (see\n Section 2).\n Rather, the mechanical approach favored a contact or impact model of\nthe interaction of small, unobservable \u201ccorpuscles\u201d of\nmatter (which possess only a limited number of mainly geometric\nproperties, such as size, motion, shape, etc.). Over the course of the\nnext decade, Descartes worked on a large number of problems in both\nscience and mathematics, with particular emphasis on the theory of\nlight, mechanics (including hydrostatics), and the free-fall of\nterrestrial bodies. Much of Descartes\u2019 output at this time is\nboth highly mathematical and concerns only specific physical problems,\nnot unlike the work of his contemporary Galileo. One of the\naccomplishments of these years includes his discovery of the law of\nrefraction, often called Snell\u2019s law: when light passes from one\nmedium into another, the sine of the angle of incidence maintains a\nconstant ratio to the sine of the angle of refraction. By the\nbeginning of the 1630s, however, Descartes embarked on a more\nambitious plan to construct a systematic theory of knowledge,\nincluding physics. The result was The World (1633), an\nimportant text in that it essentially contains the blueprints of the\nmechanical/geometric physics, as well as the vortex theory of\nplanetary motion, that Descartes would continue to refine and develop\nover the course of his scientific career. Before publishing the\ntreatise, however, he learned of the Church\u2019s (1633)\ncondemnation of Galileo for promoting Copernicanism, which prompted\nDescartes to withdraw his work from publication (since Descartes also\nadvanced Copernicanism in The World). In the 1630s, the\npublication of the Geometry, the Optics, and the\nMeteorology, along with a philosophical introduction,\nDiscourse on the Method (1637) further presented Cartesian\nhypotheses on such topics as the law of refraction, vision, and the\nrainbow. Yet, besides a brief sketch of his metaphysics and physics in\nthe Discourse (Parts IV and V), a comprehensive treatment of\nhis physics had to await the 1644 publication of the Principles of\nPhilosophy. This work not only represents Descartes\u2019 most\nfully developed and exhaustive investigation of physics, it also\nprovides the metaphysical underpinnings of his physical system (in\nPart I). As an embodiment of his mature views, the Principles\nwill thus form the basis of our examination of Cartesian physics.\n",
