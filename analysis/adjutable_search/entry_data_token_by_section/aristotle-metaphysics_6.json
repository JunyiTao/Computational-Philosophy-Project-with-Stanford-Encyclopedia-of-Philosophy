    "main_text": "Substance and Essence\n7. Substance and Essence\n\nAristotle turns in \u0396.4 to a consideration of the next candidate\nfor substance: essence. (\u2018Essence\u2019 is the standard English\ntranslation of Aristotle\u2019s curious phrase to ti \u00ean\neinai, literally \u201cthe what it was to be\u201d for a thing.\nThis phrase so boggled his Roman translators that they coined the word\nessentia to render the entire phrase, and it is from this\nLatin word that ours derives. Aristotle also sometimes uses the\nshorter phrase to ti esti, literally \u201cthe what it\nis,\u201d for approximately the same idea.) In his\n logical works,\n Aristotle links the notion of essence to that of definition\n(horismos)\u2014\u201ca definition is an account\n(logos) that signifies an essence\u201d (Topics\n102a3)\u2014and he links both of these notions to a\ncertain kind of per se predication (kath\u2019\nhauto, literally, \u201cin respect of itself,\u201d or\n\u201cintrinsically\u201c)\u2014\u201dwhat belongs to a thing in\nrespect of itself belongs to it in its essence (en t\u00f4i ti\nesti)\u201d for we refer to it \u201cin the account that states\nthe essence\u201d (Posterior Analytics,\n73a34\u20135). He reiterates these ideas in \u0396.4:\n\u201cthere will be an essence only of those things whose\nlogos is a definition\u201d (1030a6), \u201cthe\nessence of each thing is what it is said to be intrinsically\u201d\n(1029b14). It is important to remember that for Aristotle,\none defines things, not words. The definition of tiger does not tell\nus the meaning of the word \u2018tiger\u2019; it tells us what it is\nto be a tiger, what a tiger is said to be intrinsically. Thus, the\ndefinition of tiger states the essence\u2014the \u201cwhat it is to\nbe\u201d of a tiger, what is predicated of the tiger per\nse.\n\nAristotle\u2019s preliminary answer (\u0396.4) to the question\n\u201cWhat is substance?\u201d is that substance is essence, but\nthere are important qualifications. For, as he points out,\n\u201cdefinition (horismos), like \u2018what-it-is\u2019\n(ti esti), is said in many ways too\u201d\n(1030a19). That is, items in all the categories are\ndefinable, so items in all the categories have essences\u2014just as\nthere is an essence of man, there is also an essence of white and an\nessence of musical. But, because of the pros hen equivocity\nof \u2018is\u2019, such essences are secondary\u2014\u201cin the\nprimary (prot\u00f4s) and unconditional way\n(hapl\u00f4s) definition and the essence belong to\nsubstances\u201d (1030b4\u20136). Thus, \u0396.4 tells\nus, it is only these primary essences that are substances. Aristotle\ndoes not here work out the details of this \u201chierarchy of\nessences\u201d (Loux, 1991), but it is possible to reconstruct a\ntheory of such a hierarchy on the basis of subsequent developments in\nBook \u0396.\n\nIn \u0396.6, Aristotle goes on to argue that if something is\n\u201cprimary\u201d and \u201cspoken of in respect of itself\n(kath\u2019 hauto legomenon)\u201d it is one and the same\nas its essence. The precise meaning of this claim, as well as the\nnature and validity of the arguments offered in support of it, are\nmatters of scholarly controversy. But it does seem safe to say that\nAristotle thinks that an \u201caccidental unity\u201d such as a pale\nman is not a kath\u2019 hauto legomenon (since pallor is an\naccidental characteristic of a man) and so is not the same as its\nessence. Pale man, that is to say, does not specify the\n\u201cwhat it is\u201d of any primary being, and so cannot be an\nessence of the primary kind. As \u0396.4 has already told us, essence,\nin the primary sense, \u201cwill belong to things that are species of\na genus and to nothing else\u201d (1030a11\u201312).\nMan is a species, and so there is an essence of man; but\npale man is not a species and so, even if there is such a\nthing as the essence of pale man, it is not, at any rate, a primary\nessence.\n\nAt this point there appears to be a close connection between the\nessence of a substance and its species (eidos), and this\nmight tempt one to suppose that Aristotle is identifying the substance\nof a thing (since the substance of a thing is its essence) with its\nspecies. (A consequence of this idea would be that Aristotle is\nradically altering his conception of the importance of the species,\nwhich in the Categories he called a secondary substance, that\nis, a substance only in a secondary sense.) But such an identification\nwould be a mistake, for two reasons. First, Aristotle\u2019s point at\n1030a11 is not that a species is an essence, but that an\nessence of the primary kind corresponds to a species (e.g.,\nman) and not to some more narrowly delineated kind (e.g.,\npale man). Second, the word \u2018eidos\u2019,\nwhich meant \u2018species\u2019 in the logical works, has acquired a\nnew meaning in a hylomorphic context, where it means\n\u2018form\u2019 (contrasted with \u2018matter\u2019) rather than\n\u2018species\u2019 (contrasted with \u2018genus\u2019). In the\nconceptual framework of Metaphysics \u0396, a universal such\nas man or horse\u2014which was called a species and\na secondary substance in the Categories\u2014is construed as\n\u201cnot substance but rather a compound of a sort, [consisting] of\nthis account and this matter taken universally\u201d (\u0396.10,\n1035b29\u201330). The eidos that is primary\nsubstance in Book \u0396 is not the species that an individual\nsubstance belongs to but the form that is predicated of the matter of\nwhich it is\n composed.[4]\n",
