    "main_text": "Issues in the Special Sciences || Contemporary Rational Choice Theory\n6.2 Contemporary Rational Choice Theory\n\nContemporary mainstream economists hold a view concerning objectivity\nthat mirrors Max Weber\u2019s (see above). On the one hand, it is\nclear that value judgments are at the heart of economic theorizing.\n\u201cPreferences\u201d are a key concept of rational choice theory,\nthe main theory in contemporary mainstream economics. Preferences are\nevaluations. If an individual prefers \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), she\nvalues \\(A\\) higher than \\(B\\) (Hausman 2012). Thus, to the\nextent that economists predict and explain market behavior in terms of\nrational choice theory, they predict and explain market behavior in a\nway laden with value judgments.\n\nHowever, economists are not themselves supposed to take a stance about\nwhether or not whatever individuals value is also\n\u201cobjectively\u201d good in a stronger sense:\n\n\n[\u2026] that an agent is rational from [rational choice\ntheory]\u2019s point of view does not mean that the course of action\nshe will choose is objectively optimal. Desires do not have to align\nwith any objective measure of \u201cgoodness\u201d: I may want to\nrisk swimming in a crocodile-infested lake; I may desire to smoke or\ndrink even though I know it harms me. Optimality is determined by the\nagent\u2019s desires, not the converse. (Paternotte 2011:\n307\u20138)\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Gul and Pesendorfer write:\n\n\nHowever, standard economics has no therapeutic ambition, i.e., it does\nnot try to evaluate or improve the individual\u2019s objectives.\nEconomics cannot distinguish between choices that maximize happiness,\nchoices that reflect a sense of duty, or choices that are the response\nto some impulse. Moreover, standard economics takes no position on the\nquestion of which of those objectives the agent should pursue. (Gul\nand Pesendorfer 2008: 8)\n\n\nAccording to the standard view, all that rational choice theory\ndemands is that people\u2019s preferences are (internally)\nconsistent; it has no business in telling people what they ought to\nprefer, whether their preferences are consistent with external norms\nor values. Economics is thus value-laden, but laden with the values of\nthe agents whose behavior it seeks to predict and explain and not with\nthe values of those who seek to predict and explain this behavior.\n\nWhether or not social science, and economics in particular, can be\nobjective in this\u2014Weber\u2019s and the contemporary\neconomists\u2019\u2014sense is controversial. On the one hand, there\nare some reasons to believe that rational choice theory (which is at\nwork not only in economics but also in political science and other\nsocial sciences) cannot be applied to empirical phenomena without\nreferring to external norms or values (Sen 1993; Reiss 2013).\n\nOn the other hand, it is not clear that economists and other social\nscientists qua social scientists shouldn\u2019t participate in a\ndebate about social goals. For one thing, trying to do welfare\nanalysis in the standard Weberian way tends to obscure rather than to\neliminate normative commitments (Putnam and Walsh 2007). Obscuring\nvalue judgments can be detrimental to the social scientist as policy\nadviser because it will hamper rather than promote trust in social\nscience. For another, economists are in a prime position to contribute\nto ethical debates, for a variety of reasons, and should therefore\ntake this responsibility seriously (Atkinson 2001).\n",
