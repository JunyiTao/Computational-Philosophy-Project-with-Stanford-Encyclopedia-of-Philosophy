    "main_text": "Defining Concepts in Terms of Others || Distributed and Common Knowledge\n2.4 Distributed and Common Knowledge\n\nThe second option in the previous case is, as described, semantic: it\ntakes the semantic counterpart of an existing modality(ies), and then\nextracts from it (them) a further semantic component in terms of which\na new modality can be defined. Here are two further examples of this\nstrategy.\n\nConsider again the basic multi-agent epistemic logic with language\n\\(\\cL_{\\left\\{ \\oK{1}, \\ldots, \\oK{n} \\right\\}}\\). As mentioned above,\nthis setting is multi-modal, as its language contains, for each agent\n\\(i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\), a knowledge modality \\(K_i\\) that is\nsemantically interpreted in the standard way with respect to a\nmatching epistemic relation \\(R_i\\). While a modality for the concept\nof everybody knows (E) is syntactically definable\n(because the set of agents is finite), other group epistemic notions,\nsuch as distributed knowledge and common knowledge are\n not.[4]\n\nConsider first the notion of distributed knowledge,\nintuitively understood as all the logical consequences of the union of\nthe agents\u2019 individual knowledge (alternatively, what the\nmembers of the group can conclude by pooling all their information\ntogether). From this intuitive definition, it is clear that this\nconcept can be defined semantically in terms of the agent\u2019s\nindividual epistemic relations. More precisely, a relation describing\nthe distributed knowledge modality should correspond to the\nintersection of the individual epistemic relations, \\(R_D :=\n\\bigcap_{i \\in \\ttA} R_i\\). Thus, given an evaluation point w,\na world u will be considered possible after the agents share\nall they know if and only if all of them considered it possible before\nthe communication (or, in other words, u will be considered\npossible if and only if no one can discard it). One simply\nextends the language with a modality D, semantically\ninterpreted with respect to this new relation: \n\\[ (M, w) \\Vdash D\\varphi \\quad\\iffdef\\quad \\text{for all } u \\in W,\n \\text{ if } R_Dwu \\text{ then } (M, u) \\Vdash \\varphi.  \\]\n\n\nAnother important notion, crucial in the study of social interaction,\nis\n common knowledge.\n This concept can be described as what everybody knows, everybody\nknows that everybody knows, everybody knows that everybody knows that\neverybody knows, and so on. Just as with distributed knowledge, this\nnotion does not require the addition of further semantic components:\nthe individual epistemic indistinguishability relations already\nprovide everything that is needed to make the definition explicit. If\none defines an epistemic relation for the \u201ceverybody\nknows\u201d modality in the natural way \\((R_E := \\bigcup_{i \\in\n\\ttA} R_i)\\), and then define \\(R_C\\) as the transitive closure of\n\\(R_E\\), \n\\[\nR_C := (R_E)^+,\n\\]\n\n\none can simply extend the language with a modality C,\nsemantically interpreted in terms of \\(R_C\\): \n\\[ (M, w) \\Vdash {C\\varphi} \\quad\\iffdef\\quad \\text{for all } u \\in W,\n    \\text{ if } R_Cwu \\text{ then } (M, u) \\Vdash \\varphi.  \\]\n\n\nAt world w a formula \\(\\varphi\\) is commonly known among the\nagents if and only if \\(\\varphi\\) is the case in every world\n(the \u201cfor all\u201d in C\u2019s semantic\ninterpretation) that can be reached by any finite non-zero\nsequence of transitions in \\(R_E\\) (the fact that \\(R_C\\) is the\ntransitive closure of \\(R_E)\\). In other words, \\(\\varphi\\) is\ncommonly known among the agents if and only if everybody knows\n\\(\\varphi\\) (any sequence of length 1), everybody knows that everybody\nknows \\(\\varphi\\) (any sequence of length 2), and so\n on.[5]\n",
