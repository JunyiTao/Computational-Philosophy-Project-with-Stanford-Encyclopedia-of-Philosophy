    "preamble": "\n\nMental disorder (earlier entitled \u201cillness\u201d or\n\u201cdisease\u201d), is ascribed to deviations from normal\nthoughts, reasoning, feelings, attitudes, and actions that are by\ntheir subjects, or by others, considered socially or personally\ndysfunctional and apt for treatment. Schizophrenia, depression,\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, substance abuse, and mania are\nexamples. The concept of mental disorder plays a role in many domains,\nincluding medicine, social sciences such as psychology and\nanthropology, and the humanities, including literature and philosophy.\nPhilosophical discussions are the primary focus of the present entry,\nwhich differs from the entry on Philosophy of Psychiatry in noting\nseveral different approaches\u2014not only those of the philosophy of\nscience and mind, but also those arising from phenomenological and\nsocial theory traditions.\n\nAs a category, mental disorder is not well fitted to the part it plays\nin contemporary psychiatry, since it is often misunderstood, and\nvariously interpreted. Although widely judged to be forms of disorder,\nconditions such as those listed above have not all always been so\nunderstood (Porter 2002). Even when deemed to be disorder, moreover,\nthat status has frequently indicated ethical, as much as other\ndeficiency (Irwin 2013). Such reminders direct our attention to\ncontemporary medical psychiatry\u2019s sometimes uncompromisingly\nneurobiological, and avowedly value-free \u201cmedical model\u201d,\nwith its incumbent analogies and assumptions, and to the general\nquestion of how the taxa of psychiatric classifications are to be\nviewed as objects of natural science. This model has received\nintensive and continuing philosophical analysis and critique,\nincluding by those denying these conditions are deficiencies at all.\nAnd along with issues arising from cognitive psychology and the\nneurosciences, such foundational matters make up much of the following\nentry. Because of their focus on ideas central to the philosophy of\nmind and ethics, such as the relation of mind to body, responsibility,\nagency and identity, analyses of mental disorder have extensive\nimplications for those fields. As clinical phenomena, they also\nreflect an inescapable, everyday, societal reality, giving theoretical\ninquiries additionally urgent practical, moral, and legal,\nimplications.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Terminology\n\nThe language here is highly contentious. There are exceptions, but in\na long history mental disorders or illnesses have been referred to as\n\u201cevil\u201d, and \u201cwillful error\u201d or, at the very\nleast, regarded as unwelcome\n misfortune.[1]\n And with some regularity, conditions like those listed in the current\ndiagnostic and classificatory manual of the American Psychiatric\nAssociation (DSM-5 [APA 2013]) and or the International Statistical\nClassification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11 [WHO\n2020]) have been provided new classificatory titles and terminology,\nsuch revisions often solely aimed at reducing negative and\nstigmatizing associations. Authors cited in what follows use\n\u201cmental disorder\u201d, \u201cpsychiatric disability\u201d,\n\u201cpsychiatric disorder\u201d, \u201cmental illness\u201d,\n\u201cmadness\u201d, \u201cpsychopathology\u201dand\n\u201cneuro-atypicality\u201d. Controversy attaches to these terms,\nas it does to particular diagnostic labels (such as\n\u201cschizophrenia\u201d). Because some would question whether\nthese mental differences are forms of illness or disorder at all, the\nmore neutral but rarely used, \u201cmental difference\u201d perhaps\nbetter accommodates each side of this controversy, so the choice of\n\u201cdisorder\u201d here is for its greater familiarity, and not\nintended to promote a disorder or illness view.\n\nThree changes of language require special attention. With increasing\nfrequency, the term \u201cillness\u201d in \u201cmental\nillness\u201d has been replaced by \u201cdisorder\u201d,\napparently without a consistent rationale beyond avoiding explicitly\nmedical associations. In a parallel recent trend \u201cthe\ncognitive\u201d and \u201ccognition\u201d are sometimes introduced\nas equivalents or replacements for \u201cthe mental\u201d. This new\nlanguage around \u201ccognition\u201d collapses the earlier faculty\npsychology divisions of affection and cognition: as much as doxastic\nstates, emotions are\n \u201ccognitive\u201d.[2]\n Finally, increasing use of \u201cmental and\nbehavioral\u201d, sometimes shortened to\n\u201cbehavioral\u201d (as in \u201cbehavioral health\u201d),\nreflects substantive changes, such as the inclusion of addictions in\nthe class of disorders, and a preference for precisely measurable\nsymptoms over subjective report.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the expression \u201cmental\ndisorder\u201d replaces \u201cmental illness\u201d in what follows,\nand refers not only to more \u201cmental\u201d conditions like\npsychoses and affective disorders, but also to\n\u201cbehavioral\u201d conditions such as addictions and personality\ndisorders. Frequently, the shift from \u2019mental\u2019 to\n\u201ccognitive\u201d also indicates allegiance to substantive\ntheoretical tenets. Here, however, \u201ccognitive\u201d and\n\u201ccognition\u201d are used only as terms of art within\nparticular theoretical analyses.\n2. Folk Psychology, Conceptual Analysis, and Science\n\nBoth common sense folk psychology and medical psychiatry employ\nconcepts of mental disorder or illness, engendering confusion.\n(\u201cDepression\u201d refers to roughly the same mood states and\nattitudes, for example, used by a professionals or non-professionals.)\nInconsistencies arising at the boundaries, where mental disorders meet\nother kinds of disorder, add ambiguity. Rather than traditionally\nmental symptoms, for example, \u201chysterical\u201d\n(\u201cpsychosomatic\u201d, \u201csomatoform\u201d,\n\u201cfunctional\u201d or \u201cconversion\u201d) syndromes\nexhibit bodily maladies and dysfunction ( Scull 2009). Yet they remain\nmental disorders in common understanding, and have long found a place\nin standard psychiatric\n classifications.[3]\n Also anomalous, some conditions with apparently mental symptoms are\nthe causal product of what are, indisputably, diseases of and damage\nto the brain. (Delusions following cerebral hemorrhage are an\nexample.) They are judged to be neurological rather than psychiatric\ncomplaints, and excluded from the class of mental disorders according\nto both everyday conceptions, and diagnostic taxonomies. Similarly,\nalthough perception is widely judged a mental capacity, some\nconditions affecting sight, such as blindness, are absent from\ndiagnostic classifications.\n\nThere are different views about the conceptual relationship between\neveryday and more clinical language about mental disorder, and\nphilosophers and others have approached this matter according to\nvarying foundational assumptions. Both commonsense psychology and\nconceptual analysis reflecting it, are part of what Rachel Cooper\ncalls a broadly \u201cdescriptive\u201d project, which engages\nlinguistic intuitions (Cooper 2020). Opinions vary as to the value and\nimportance of the resulting characterizations. Some insist that the\nconcept of mental disorder employed in psychiatry\u2019s conception\nand classification of disorders is too closely allied to the parallel\nconcepts in folk psychology. According to Dominic Murphy, acceptance\nof inconsistent folk psychological categorizing is ill-suited to the\nproperly scientific taxonomic task which, because it is tied to the\nhope for a theory of the \u201chidden structure\u201d of the\ntaxonomic domain, seeks causal explanation (Murphy 2012). Without a\nprincipled and systematic way to identify the class of mental\ndisorders, these concerns suggest, any disorder taxonomy that is\npresently employed will likely prove inaccurate, and indicate that the\nout-moded, folk psychological category of mental disorder will\neventually be rendered otiose.\n\nMore conservatively, others have urged the practical importance of\nmaintaining the category of mental disorder (Br\u00fclde & Radovic\n2006). Everyday language and the traditional classifications built\naround it have provided a common framework for research and clinical\npractice; and with any further blurring of the boundaries between\nmental disorders and the brain damage and disease treated by\nneurologists, demarcations of professional competence would be lost.\nFear of over-diagnosis, of granting too much power to medical\npsychiatry and the psychopharmacology industry, and of relinquishing\nto experts decisions about mental health and conceptions of eudaimonia\nmore appropriately resolved by non-scientists, have all challenged the\nsocietal place occupied by medical psychiatry (see\n \u00a710).\n\nIt is not only for such considerations of practicality and custom that\ncommon sense concepts have been supported. Some analyses adhere to an\naccount of mind and mental processing employing mentalist terms and\nnormative presuppositions inapplicable within an exclusively\nneuro-physical framework (see\n \u00a74,\n \u00a75, and\n \u00a78).\n Others regard mental disorders as socially constructed entities, the\nexistence and classification of which are inextricably tied to\nsocietal and interpersonal features of the world (see\n \u00a710).\n\nA meta-taxonomy of these varying foundational assumptions includes\nintersecting issues: what mental disorders are; how much we can\npresently know about them; and different approaches to their analysis.\nThus, in one set of contrasts, objectivist (or naturalist) accounts\nhold that as empirically discoverable items mental disorders can be\nprovided value-free description, while evaluativist (or normative)\nanalyses deny the possibility of such description (discussed in\n \u00a78.1).\n Revisionists, prepared to relinquish all current concepts, disagree\nwith conservatives favoring the retention of (at least some)\ntraditional categories. And, in a final sorting, the nature of mental\ndisorder will be sought either through a posteriori\nscientific research based in neurocognitive science, or through\nconceptual analysis derived in part or whole from social and cultural\nnorms.\n3. The Mental in Mental Disorder\n\nIn a once-common practice, mental or \u201cfunctional\u201d\ndisorders were diagnosed just when no somatic traits were evident.\nSuch language is now explicitly disavowed, eclipsed by a growing\nrecognition that all disorders involve bodily states ( APA 2013: 309;\nO\u2019Leary 2021). Still, the \u201cmental\u201d in mental\ndisorder is variously construed.\n3.1 Internal Causes and Downstream (Symptomatic) Manifestations\n\nOn traditional, two-part models from cell pathology, dysfunctional\norganic processes internal to the individual are manifested in, and\ncausally responsible for, more readily observable signs and symptoms;\ncollectively, these two parts make up the disease. Applied to mental\ndisorder, certain of those underlying processes have been delimited as\nmental by appeal to the traditional categories of faculty psychology\n(perception, affection, cognition, memory, and so on). For example,\nhallucinations represent dysfunctional perceptual capabilities, mania\nand depression disturbed affect regulation, and delusions defective\ncognitive processing. A disorder is thus determined to be mental as\ndistinct from physical if its internal causes involve psychological\nfaculties (Wakefield 1997). Other accounts ascribe disordered\nmentality not to underlying features but to effects on the\nsubject\u2019s social and personal functioning (Rashed & Bingham\n2014). For example, it is because her states of sadness and self-doubt\nresult in absenteeism, that the person with depression seeks medical\nhelp (see\n \u00a74.2).\n More holistic and \u201cbiopsychosocial\u201d accounts combine\nthese features (see Nordenfelt 1995; Davies & Roache 2017; Bolton\n& Gillett 2019; O\u2019Leary 2021).\n\nOn two-stage accounts both internal and outwardly-observed features\nform integral parts. (At least this is true of mental disorders that\nare prototypical, according to George Graham [2013].) Internal and\nmore readily observable features are each included in the DSM\ndefinition of mental disorder:\n\n\na syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an\nindividual\u2019s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior, that\nreflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or\ndevelopmental processes underlying mental functioning. (APA 2013: 20,\nemphasis added)\n\n\nThe different positions on mental disorder just\nsketched\u2014emphasizing internal conditions, observable\nmanifestations (or \u201csymptoms\u201d), and both\u2014are\ndiscussed in\n Section 4.\n Each position exhibits vulnerabilities. Accounts stressing inherent\nfeatures regularly rely on hypothetical entities or processes,\nexpecting that out of future discoveries will emerge knowledge of\ncausal mechanisms presently hidden from view. (This position has a\nlong history; for a thoroughgoing version, see Murphy 2012.) Often\naccounted for by its status as a new science, this faith has been\nsorely tested, thus far, by confused classifications, apparently\nill-grounded research, and other liabilities, as well as incomplete\nmodels of mental dysfunction (see\n \u00a74\n and\n \u00a76).\n If these impediments can be overcome, emphasis on internal causes may\nbe expected to yield powerful explanatory models, laying the ground\nfor incalculably valuable, targeted interventions and effective\nprevention and treatment. (See entry on Philosophy of Psychiatry).\nPlacing emphasis on disabling or dysfunctional observable symptoms has\ncomparable vulnerabilities. One setting\u2019s dysfunctional mental\nsymptom may be another\u2019s normal, admired, or useful trait; and\nmental disorder must be distinguished conceptually from deviance, as\nwell as from normal responses to the losses and setbacks that are our\ncommon human experience (these issues are discussed in\n \u00a74,\n \u00a78, and\n \u00a710).\n3.2 The Mark of the Mental\n\nIn some philosophical accounts including those stemming from\nphenomenological traditions, the mental is distinguished by particular\nfeatures: it bears a special relationship to conscious awareness, and\nto persons, for example, or may be taken to exhibit the distinctive\n\u201caboutness\u201d or intentionality exclusive to mental\nattitudes (see\n \u00a75).\n Similarly, some theorizing emphasizes the reasons-responsiveness of\nall human thought and action, by which disorder can alone be explained\nand understood (Campbell 2013; Thornton 2007; Summers &\nSinnott-Armstrong 2019).\n\nExplanations in cognitive psychology have taken several different\nforms over the years: information processing models, which themselves\nwere made up of computational processes and representations;\nconnectionist networks; and, more recently, directly neural accounts.\nMoreover, philosophical reconstructions of cognitive psychology and\ncognitive science must be distinguished from the cognitive psychology\npracticed by psychologists\u2014although little discussion of\n\u201cthe mental\u201d occurs in either. Instead, focus is on the\ncognitive when, as was pointed out earlier, the\n\u201ccognitive\u201d subsumes capacities, states, and processes\nthat used to be considered non-cognitive, such as sensations and\nemotions. Widespread acceptance of these shifts in much theoretical\nand research writing on mental disorder has gone some way toward\neclipsing more philosophical concepts of mind and the mental, even\nthough commonsense cognitive capacities, which are understood to\ninvolve intentionality, remain the starting point of the research\nprogram of cognitive science, and branches of cognitive psychology and\ncognitive neuroscience address traditionally \u201cmental\u201d\nprocesses such as reasoning and consciousness.\n\nThe focus of cognitive psychology usually lies with computation and\nrepresentation. Mental/cognitive states (representations) depict\nfeatures of the outside world (as well as other mental states and\nabstract entities), and mental/cognitive processes operate on those\ninner symbols, transforming and manipulating them (see Von Eckardt\n1993; Friedenberg & Silverman 2011; Cratsley & Samuels 2013,\nand the\n entry on Cognitive Science).\n Although demarcated by the faculties known as \u201cmental\u201d,\nthe realm of the cognitive is typically construed as properties or\nprocesses with a causal role in determining behavior, or behavioral\ncapacities, that offer no resistance to naturalistic characterization\n(Chalmers 1996). Candidates for a distinctive \u201cmark of the\ncognitive\u201d are debated\u2014but so is the need for one ( see\nVarga 2018; Allen 2017).\n3.3 Metaphysical Implications\n\nMental disorders are conditions or states attributed to persons, but\nthis need entail neither that they are entirely non-physical in\nnature, nor that they must (or even can), be explained in solely\nneuro-scientific terms. Maintaining the separation between mental and\nphysical disorders is compatible with some forms of weak physicalism,\nallowing that mental or psychological processing involved in functions\nsuch as perception, reasoning and memory, are realized in the workings\nof the brain (see Schaffner 2016; Jefferson 2021 and the\n entry on health).\n Problems of both supervenience and emergence theories have been seen\nto argue towards the holistic \u201cnaturalistic dualism\u201d\nentailed in a biopsychosocial model (Bolton & Gillett 2019;\nO\u2019Leary 2021).\n4. The Disorder in Mental Disorder\n\nDepression and anxiety, the schizophrenias, obsessions, compulsions\nand the like are core instances of mental disorder, but psychiatric\nclassification acknowledges many other conditions as well. From such a\nlarge and apparently heterogeneous collection, the broad category may\nbest be judged a family resemblance one. Indeed, through a different\nhistorical or cultural lens, the assembled variations known today as\nmental disorders would likely appear incoherently arbitrary. Yet,\nspurred by essentialist expectations (and out of concern about the\nunwarranted \u201cmedicalization\u201d of normal states and\nbehavior), the quest for a unifying conception of mental disorder\n(illness, or disease) has persisted within philosophical research.\nCharacteristic features have been identified, including disunity,\nirrationality, the presence of suffering and disability, several forms\nof dysfunction, and even adaptive function. Proposed formal analytic\ndefinitions are illustrated in\n Section 4.4.\n4.1 Disunity and Irrationality\n\nWorks of ancient philosophy are focused more on the psyche\u2019s\nhealth (or eudaimonia) than its illness. Nonetheless, there\nare hints that just as a unified soul is one that is healthy (as well\nas rational and virtuous), a soul lacking unity will be disturbed, or\nmad. Offering an account of the harmonious soul, whose rational and\nnon-rational elements achieve unity, Aristotle leaves us a picture of\nthe warring and fractured state of an unhealthy soul, for\n example.[4]\n The emphasis on disunity is here tied to the vices and irrationality:\na fully unified soul is virtuous and rational, a dis-unified one\nvicious and irrational in its unhealthy divisions. And, while adhering\nto a different account of the passions and a more knowledge-based and\nPlatonic analysis of vice, this link with the vices and virtues is\nalso characteristic of the subsequent Stoic analyses (Irwin 2013). A\nconception of mental illness as psychic disunity (as well as an\nassociation between health, rationality and virtue) reoccurs in later\nphilosophy (in Spinoza, for example), and in psychoanalytic\ntraditions. Within present-day disorder descriptions, some symptom\nclusters readily fit the classical emphasis on disunity (addictions,\nand bipolarity, for example); others, including most personality\ndisorders, are less easily depicted in such terms (see Worrell &\nDenham 2016).\n\nAs a characteristic attributed to mental disorder irrationality or\n\u201cunreason\u201d has been linked to emphasis on order and logic\nduring the \u201cAge of Reason\u201d. Together with the emergence of\nempirical science, this emphasis is seen to have laid the foundation\nfor our contemporary psychiatric categories and\n theories.[5]\n In the present day, cultural norms and intuitive folk psychology\nassign the boundaries of mental disorder, and these intuitions\nconflict about some particular conditions (addictions, and disorders\nof personality, for example). Yet disturbed or disabled doxastic\nstates and capabilities remain core examples of disorder, over which\nintuitive agreement is strong. Characterized by incomprehensibly\ndisordered thought, failure to adjust beliefs in response to new\nevidence, inconsistencies between thought and action, and delusional\nconvictions, psychosis and psychotic thought patterns are regularly\njudged prototypical features of mental disorder. So the rationalistic\nanalysis of disorder corresponds\u2014but only to a reduced version\nof the presently sprawling overall category.\n\nForms of doxastic irrationality are still the mainstay of much policy\nand legal analysis about mental disorder. Assessments of criminal\nresponsibility, of fitness to stand trial, and of the capacity to\nundertake binding contracts, for example, are expressed in terms of\nthe defendant\u2019s ability to know and understand (Reznek 1987;\nRobinson 1996, 2013; Adshead 2008). Ostensibly, construing mental\ndisorder as a want of rationality has been weakened by evidence from\nbehavioral economics showing that holding and acting on well-grounded\nand reasons-responsive beliefs occurs rarely in the general\npopulation, and common prejudices and superstitions seem barely\ndistinguishable from clinical delusions with respect not only to their\nprevalence but to the way they are adopted and maintained (Bortolotti\n2009, 2013, 2020).\n\nConfidence that a want of rationality defines mental disorder is\nsimilarly eroded if, understood as effective social function and\npersonal flourishing, mental health lies in traits such as unwarranted\noptimism, and the distorting tendency to emphasize, and remember,\nsuccess over failure experiences in \u201cpositive\nillusions\u201d(Taylor & Brown 1988; McKay & Dennett 2009;\nJefferson et al. 2017). Along these lines, some illusions, delusions,\nand hallucinations have recently been acknowledged to be\n\u201cperfectly acceptable, sometimes praiseworthy ways of being\nhopeful, committed to imagining and enacting a better world for\noneself and others\u2026making moral and meaningful\nlives\u201d(Flanagan & Graham 2017: 309)\n\nBut as this indicates, whether disorder is usefully characterized as a\nwant of reason also depends on guiding, normative conceptions of\nmental health or eudaimonia, and on the role of reason in\nthose conceptions\u2014not merely on facts of the matter, or on\nconsequentialist reasoning.\n4.2 Suffering and Disability\n\nOther depictions of disorder rely on one or both of the groups of\ntraits around suffering, distress and psychic pain,\non the one hand, and, on the other hand, disability,\nincapacity and personal or behavioral dysfunction. These\nare the features noted in a series of influential prefatory remarks in\nthe diagnostic and statistical manuals (the DSMs and ICDs). The\nwording of the fifth edition of the DSM introduces a disjunction:\n\n\nMental disorders are usually associated with significant distress\nor disability in social, occupational, or other important\nactivities. (APA 2013 emphasis added)\n\n\nA very similar passage from the ICD-11 is comparably qualified:\n\n\n\u201cDisorder\u201d\u2026is\u2026a clinically recognizable set\nof symptoms or behavior associated in most cases with\ndistress and with interference with personal functions. (WHO\n2020, emphasis added)\n\n\nPsychodynamic or psychoanalytic presuppositions may posit underlying\ndistresses that are masked, or submerged within the psyche; and the\nelusive phenomenology of some conditions suggests the presence of\nnameless existential anxieties hidden from awareness (Ratcliffe 2008,\n2017). But such explanations aside, distress has been widely regarded\nas a ubiquitous feature of disorder. In symptom-focused accounts\nlaying stress on the consequences of the syndrome, distress\nbecomes prominent as a form of disabling dysfunction (Stein et. al.\n2010). Instead of separate criteria (and either singly or jointly\nsufficient for disorder, as in the respective DSM and ICD definitions\nabove), suffering and dysfunction are conjoined on a\n\u201cdistress-impairment\u201d analysis, where disorder status is\nassigned with (and defined as) distress that is \u201cunmanageable or\ndisabling\u201d (Bolton 2013). The plausibility of this analysis\nincreases with what have been called \u201cdistress related\nconditions\u201d, such as depression and anxiety, that are\n\u201cmore constitutive of the illness\u201d (Bolton 2012: 10; see\nalso\n \u00a74).\n\nTo accommodate exceptions that seem neither distressing nor disabling\n(such as manic states), mental disorder is sometimes characterized not\nby distress and dysfunction but by raised risk of such outcomes (Gert\n& Culver 2004). But risk of disorder is not disorder, and risk\nlanguage invites troubling ethical issues around over-diagnosis and\nfalse positives ((Schwartz 2008; Stein et al. 2010; Bolton 2013;\nBroome, Fugar-Poli, & Wuyts 2013; Radden 2018).\n\nLoosely understood, moreover, distresses such as these are an\ninescapable part of the human condition and normal responses to\nlife\u2019s vicissitudes. When and whether normal (and even\nappropriate) suffering reflects pathology has long been the source of\nphilosophical\u2014and societal\u2014disagreement (Wilkinson 2000;\nHorwitz & Wakefield 2007). In the discussions of \u201cnormal\nsadness\u201d that accompanied the revision of a fifth edition of the\nDSM, the grief exclusion that had (temporarily) exempted from\ndiagnosis the suffering around mourning and grief, was challenged, its\nproposed elimination charged with \u201cmedicalizing\u201d or\n\u201cpathologizing\u201d normal and appropriate human feelings\n(Zachar 2014; Wakefield 2012, 2020). The separation of normal from\npathological distress will be indicated by distress emanating from the\ndisorder itself, rather than from other contingencies. But presently,\ndistresses resulting from the stigma and discrimination that follow\ndiagnosis and treatment, as well as a host of other, frequently\nnegative, consequences in jarring and alarming disruptions to personal\nlives, selves, and relationships, prove difficult to disentangle\n(Tekin 2011).\n\nSome predict that biological markers will eventually allow us to\ndistinguish distress that is a symptom of depression, for example,\nfrom that which is a normal response to external contingencies\n(Horwitz & Wakefield 2007). Such biomarkers may be welcomed by\nthose decrying over-diagnosis, although an evaluative interpretation\nas to whether, and when, such biomarkers occur in healthy and\nunhealthy form will be required.\n\nSome argue that the subjective experience of distress and the extent\nof impairment of the person\u2019s day-to-day functioning are\nintrinsic properties of disorders like depression: conceptually,\ndisorder attributions are made on the basis of \u201cconsequences of\nthe syndrome as they manifest for the subject\u201d (Rashed &\nBingham 2014: 245). Psychological symptoms may constitute a\nmental disorder, even as it is caused by biological or social factors.\nIn the absence of known biomarkers, depression is attributed based on\npsychological symptoms alone; and were known biomarkers present\nwithout evidence of any psychological symptoms, our intuitions\nsuggest, disorder attribution would be withheld. These intuitions may\nshift with time, it is recognized, depending on how most people and\nmost psychiatrists now understand, define, diagnose, and\ntreat, depression. But today at least, disorder would be attributed on\nthe basis of the symptoms of depression with or without biomarkers.\n(See Cooper 2020).\n\nAnalyses characterizing felt distress as a property constitutive of\nsome given psychiatric condition (such as depression), are also\ncompatible with recent models focused on the causally interconnected\nstatistical networks making up symptom clusters. These clusters are\ndepicted as reinforced through feedback loops that serve to rope\ntogether assorted symptoms independent of any underlying, antecedent,\ncommon, cause. In the case of depression, a range of symptoms arise\nfrom diverse sources and, through their looping interactions, form,\nworsen, and maintain the disorder as a relatively stable entity and\nconceptual whole (Kendler, Zachar, & Craver 2011; Borsboom &\nCramer 2013; Borsboom 2017).\n\nSymptom-focused accounts may combine suffering with disability, as was\nnoted. But a conception in terms of what the affected person is\nprevented from doing, or unable to do as well as others, captured in\nthe ideas of disability, impairment, incapacity and personal or\nbehavioral dysfunction, offers an alternative characterization that\ncan acknowledge disorders without apparent personal suffering (notably\nmania, some personality disorders, and some addictions).\n\nDysfunction and disability have been allied, or treated as rough\nequivalents; but sometimes disability is placed in opposition to\ndysfunction. Instead of construed as internal to the person,\ndisabilities are often represented as conditional\nimpairments, dependent on context (including physical and social\narrangements). They impose limitations on the person\u2019s ability\nto perform everyday activities and participate as more typically-abled\npeople do and, on this view, call for appropriate accommodation\nanalogous to ramps for those using wheelchairs (Oliver 2004; Polvora\n2011). The analogies linking psychiatric with other disabilities may\nnot be complete, however, nor can accommodations be achieved as easily\nas installing ramps (see Amundson & Tresky 2007; Rashed 2019).\n\nLike disability, the deviance eliciting societal censure and\ncondemnation is also placed in contrast to dysfunction, although\nefforts to further characterize that contrast have thus far been\nincomplete (Aftab & Rashed 2021).\n4.3 Dysfunction in Two Stage Analyses\n\nDysfunction forms a central element of the most widely discussed\nanalytic definition of mental disorder, introduced in\n Section 3.\n The notion of dysfunction applies in two distinct ways in\nWakefield\u2019s harmful dysfunction analysis, one way avowedly\nobjective, and the other not (see\n \u00a74.4).\n In the first, dysfunction occurs in some part or parts of a bodily or\nneural system. That dysfunction in turn causes dysfunction in some\npart or parts of the individual\u2019s social and personal system\n(grounding the normative judgment of harmfulness). The first kind of\ndysfunction permits non-evaluative description, it is supposed.\n\nThe characteristic dysfunction of mental disorder is here part of a\nstandard, idiopathic model, as we saw, with these disabling\ntraits understood as the symptomatic, causal manifestations of an\nunderlying, pathological process. The appropriateness of that model\nfor psychiatric conditions has received persistent critique (see\n \u00a710.1).\n Recent challenges rest on the persuasiveness of network models\n(introduced in\n \u00a74.2),\n where symptomatic dysfunction does not emanate from some disabled\ninner mechanism, but instead emerges piecemeal from interacting\nexperiences that cumulatively build clusters of disabling symptoms out\nof feedback loops (Kendler, Zachar, & Craver 2011; Borsboom &\nCramer 2013). In support of this alternative model is accumulating\nevidence from the social sciences that a range of factors combine to\nbring about disorder: individualistic risk factors, but also aspects\nof the broader context in which the individual finds herself (Bolton\n2010; Kirmayer, Lemelson, & Cummings 2015). A more fundamental\ncritique rejects the dysfunction analysis of disorder, favoring\ninstead a madness-as-strategy account which draws strength from\nadaptionism (Garson 2022; See Section 4.4).\n4.4 Formal Definitions\n\nEschewing a more formal definitions, analyses such as the\n\u201cdistress-impairment\u201d one introduced earlier rely on\nprototypical cases (see Graham 2013, for example), or point\nto intrinsic vagueness that must thwart such efforts (Keil, Keuck\n& Hauswald 2017). Others are more ambitious, proposing analytic\ndefinitions in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions and even\nencompassing other medical conditions as well as mental disorders.\n(For those stressing the inseparability and interdependence of mental\nand bodily disorder, no important distinction is acknowledged between\nmental and physical disorders [P\u00e2rvan 2015].) (i)\u2013(vi)\nbelow are a sample of these efforts. More recent definitions reflect\nincreasing recognition that the diversity of the category must\nfrustrate efforts at a covering definition.\n\nA disease is the absence of normal function of a mechanism or\nprocess in a person that detracts from the person\u2019s survival or\nreproduction (Boorse 1977). More recent elaborations on this\nearly version of the definition emphasize biological function and\nstatistical normality, so that on a bio-statistical theory,\ndiseases are internal states that depress a functional ability\nbelow species-typical levels (relative to age and sex) (Boorse\n1997). Critiques of this definition have challenged its aspiration to\nbe value free; its introduction of an arbitrarily selected reference\nclass; and its failure to honor the accepted distinction between\n\u201cdisease\u201d with its implied defectiveness, and mere\ndifference (Bolton 2008).\nA condition is a mental disorder if and only if (a) the\ncondition causes some harm or deprivation of benefit to the person as\njudged by the standards of the person\u2019s culture, and (b) the\ncondition results from the inability of some internal mechanism to\nperform its natural function, wherein a natural function is an effect\nthat is part of the evolutionary explanation of the existence and\nstructure of the mechanism (Wakefield 1992, 1997). Critiques of\nthis definition occur later in this section and in\n Section 5.\n In addition, definitions in evolutionary theoretic terms introduce a\ncategory of innate risk factors that is belied by the way natural,\nsocial, and individual factors are inextricably interwoven in disorder\n(Bolton 2008). And the formulation relies on unsubstantiated,\nempirical assumptions about the way natural selection underlies\nnatural function (Lilienfeld & Marino 1995; Murphy & Stich\n2000). The relativism in (a) above has been challenged (Gert &\nCulver 2004: 421; Bolton 2008). And rather than exhibiting\ndysfunction, at least some mental disorders may be explained\nrelationally, by traits that are mismatched in the\nperson\u2019s context, due to their developmental or evolutionary\nfeatures (Garson 2015).\nA mental malady is a condition of a person, other than his\nrational beliefs and desires, such that he is suffering, or at\nincreased risk of suffering, an evil (death, pain, disability, loss of\nfreedom or opportunity, or loss of pleasure), in the absence of a\ndistinct sustaining cause (Gert & Culver 2004). The concept\nof a sustaining cause is unacceptably vague and inclusive, permitting\nconditions to count as disorders that are not, intuitively, disorders\nat all (Murphy 2012). For example, some disorders leave permanent,\nnon-pathological alterations in the character that outlast any\nimmediate stressors.\nA condition is pathological if and only if it is an abnormal\nbodily/mental condition that requires medical intervention and that\nharms standard members of the species in standard conditions\n(Reznek 1987: 163\u20134). For criticisms of this definition\u2019s\nappeal to baseline population norms, and to medical intervention, see\ncomments on (i), (ii) and (iv) above. Reference to required medical\nintervention fails to acknowledge risks of over-medicalization and\nover-diagnosis and invokes concerns over enhancement. (See Savulescu,\nter Meulen, & Kahane 2011.)\nDiseases involve deprivation, but a disease is a depriving\nrelation rather than a depriving entity, depending on the patient for\nits existence\u2026the person is not conceived as ontologically\ndiminished or defective because it suffers the deprivation.\nDrawing on Augustine\u2019s ontology of disease, bodily integrity,\nand the human person, Alexandra P\u00e2rvan argues that disease\nstands in ontologically necessary connection with the patient as\nperson. (From this is derived a treatment approach based on how the\nperson relates to the disease, and a goal of reconfiguring the person\nas deprived but not diminished [P\u00e2rvan 2015, 2016].) This\naccount is limited inasmuch as it requires adherence to its\nAugustinian ontology.\nMental disorders are biological kinds whose effects lead to\nharmful consequences \u2026 more natural kinds of mental disorders\n(e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) are biological kinds primarily\nunderwritten by biological mechanisms. More artificial kinds (e.g.,\nhysteria, voyeuristic disorder) are social kinds primarily\nunderwritten by social mechanisms. (Tsou 2022:10).\n\u2026 at least some of the forms (of madness) \u2026 are\nstrategies for solving problems, coping with aspects of the\nenvironment, regulating one\u2019s mental economy \u2026 the\ncreative problem-solving activity of the human mind, or God\u2019s\nstern but benevolent hand, or the healing impetus of nature, or an\nevolutionary adaptation, a purpose-driven process, a well-operated\nmachine \u2026 (Garson 2022:10). If neuropsychiatry ever\nsucceeds in identifying the defective mechanisms it seeks,\nGarson\u2019s analysis must be weakened. Moreover, it seems\nvulnerable to some of the accusations of complexity-defying\noversimplification that have dogged other adaptationist just-so\nstories.\n\n5. Phenomenological Approaches\n\nThe symptoms of mental disorder are primarily, if not exclusively,\nstates about which their subject can claim a sort of authority. (Since\nin describing these states subjects can intentionally or\nunintentionally mislead, such loosely phenomenological [or\n\u201cexperience-near\u201d] reports\u2014however\nnecessary\u2014may nonetheless present epistemic limitations as data\n(Kontos 2016).) Psychology can provide reliable behavioral assessments\nof disorder, and indicate its presence through laboratory performance\ntests. But no mental disorder is thus far independently verifiable\n(though blood tests or scans, for example). First person reports play\na special part in understanding such disorder for the clinician, or\nfor the researcher, and those establishing philosophical analyses are\nsimilarly beholden (Flanagan 2011; Varga 2015). Carl Jaspers\u2019\nGeneral Psychopathology, which combines close, clinical\ndescription with the method and presuppositions of existential and\nphenomenological thinkers such as Husserl and Heidegger, has been\nwidely discussed. This pairing of clinical and philosophical knowledge\nmakes him one of the undisputed originators of the research field\nknown as the philosophy of psychiatry and psychopathology (Jaspers1913\n[1963]).) Confusingly, not every loosely\n\u201cphenomenological\u201d clinical approach focused on the\npatient\u2019s experience and report adheres to all of the tenets of\nthe philosophical discipline of Phenomenology derived from these\ntraditions, however (see Parnas & Sass 2008).\n\nThe phenomenological strand of philosophical analysis influenced by\nthinkers like Husserl and Heidegger remains focused on immediate,\nfirst person report (for example, self-experience in psychosis (Parnas\n& Sass 2008; Madeira, Pienkos, et al. 2019)); disordered temporal\nexperience (Fuchs 2005, 2013); delusional states (Parnas & Sass\n2008; Gallagher 2005, 2013); and affective disturbances (Ratcliffe\n2008; Ratcliffe & Stephan 2014; Jacobs et. al. 2014)). In these\ntraditions neither psychology nor psychopathology are empirical\nsciences in the usual sense because they involve distinctive forms of\nexplanation. Arising within nineteenth century social science, the\nhermeneutical approach involving meanings calls for Verstehen\n(understanding), a distinctive, interpretive way of apprehending human\naction. (See Jaspers 1913 [1963]; Phillips 2013,Wiggins & Schwartz\n2011; Spitzer & Uehlein 1992.) These differences of approach bring\ndiffering orientations towards fundamentals, and writing following\nGerman and French traditions has been placed in contrast to the\n\u201cAnglo-empiricist\u201d approach judged more influenced by\nempirical science, and showing greater emphasis on objectivity and\nmeasurement (Mullen 2011; see also Gergel 2012).\n\nThese differences bring contrasting theories about psychology as\nscience. Whether, bypassing diagnostic categories and medical disease\nmodels entirely, symptoms and the subjective life of the patient\nshould be the main or even sole locus of attention, is one\n(Stanghellini 2004); another is whether the experiences associated\nwith psychosis, particularly, must be categorically divorced from more\ntypical psychological processes (Sass 2001; Parnas & Sass 2008).\nEmphasizing the unique challenges imposed by interpretation in\npsychiatry, Somogy Varga has argued for a hermeneutics distinctive to\npsychiatry that is grounded in ideas about the self-interpreting\naspect of human beings, \u201cmental disorder\u201d thus standing in\nan asymmetrical relation that is supervenes on our self identities\n(Varga 2015).\n\nThere is disagreement over the correct application of phenomenological\nmethod (Mishara 2007; Sass, Parnas, & Zahavi 2011). But\npsychopathology likely offers a challenge so great as to call for a\nrange of approaches (Ratcliffe 2011; Wiggins and Schwartz 2011;\nGallagher 2013). Attempts have also been made to combine\nphenomenological with empirical approaches: Matthew Ratcliffe\u2019s\nwork on affective states employs social research methods, for example\n(Ratcliffe 2008; Ratcliffe & Stephan 2014). And efforts to tie in\nphenomenological theorizing with findings in neuroscience have yielded\nthe hybrid methodology of phenomenological clinical neuroscience\nadvocating an initial study of subjective experience to only\nthen be probed for its underlying neurobiology (Mishara 2007:\n34).\n\nThe merging of empirical and phenomenological methodologies is also\nreadily supported by the tenets of embodied and enactive cognition.\nConceptions of the embodied, embedded, and sense-making enactive mind\nbring emphasis on the way, shaped by perceptual experience,\nconsciousness and the first person perspective form the basis of all\nmental processing (Varela, Thompson, & Rosch 1991; Durt, Fuchs,\n& Tewes 2017; Di Paolo & De Jaegher 2017). Applied to mental\ndisorder, this departure from classical cognitivist assumptions and\nanalogies suggests that at least some disorder grows out of\ndisturbances in embodied interaction with the environment, and not\nfrom dysfunctions occurring in high-level cognitive mechanisms\n(Drayson 2009; Stanghellini 2004, 2016; Maiese\n 2016).[6]\n6. Classification\n\nWhile\n Section 3\n focused on what might separate mental from non-mental disorders, and\n Section 4\n was concerned with how to separate disordered from non-disordered\nstates, Section 6 addresses another aspect of classification:\ncontroversies over how different types of putative mental disorders\nshould be distinguished from one another. These controversies, like so\nmany about psychiatry, span the disciplines of medicine, science\n(including neuroscience and psychology) and philosophy.\n\nThe diagnostic and statistical classificatory manuals and\ninternational disease classifications (DSMs and ICDs) share broad\nfeatures in providing a categorical scheme of separate mental\ndisorders: each disorder is idiopathic in arising at least in part\nfrom morbid factors within the person, and each is identified\n\u201cdescriptively\u201d, using polythetic (disjunctive) criteria\nto be employed with clinical observation of individual patients\n(including their self-report). Aside from serving the institutions\nproviding services, their uniformity is aimed to enhance\ninter-diagnostician reliability; and research based on these reliable\nclassifications, it had been hoped, should eventually allow validation\nof the categories, although failure to achieve this promised yield in\nresearch findings has been conspicuous, and partly motivated the\nrevised research domain criteria (RDoC), described later in this\nsection.\n\nFollowing early work by Carl Hempel (1961) that depicted\npsychiatry\u2019s claim to scientific status as depending on the\nvalue neutrality of its classifications, much philosophical discussion\nof classification has been entirely critical, conceding little\nusefulness to the approach, skeptical of the promise of validity,\ndoubtful of its methodology and claims to scientific authority,\nun-persuaded by the categorical system employed, as well as its\nindividualistic and idiopathic emphasis, and dubious over its claim to\nbeing, or being able to be, value-free. Philosophical analysis has\noften been focused on particular symptom descriptions, disregarding or\ndisavowing the diagnostic categories of which they are presumed to be\nclinical manifestations, in some cases introducing and employing\nrevised categories such as \u201cdistress related conditions\u201d\n(Bolton 2012), \u201cbody image disorders\u201d(Morris 2013), and\n\u201creal hallucinations\u201d (Ratcliffe 2017). Others have\naccepted the entities so classified (Sass, Zahavi, Frith and\ncolleagues, for example).\n\nCriticisms of DSM and ICD classifications have addressed their\nresearch purposes and usefulness, categorical approaches and supposed\nvalue-neutrality. (The claim to value neutrality is discussed in\n Section 8.\n These classifications recognize the presence of many overarching\nvalues, including the methodological ones implicit in their goals of\nachieving validity and reliability. But further, unsupportable values\n(such as homophobia and misogyny) have been identified as well.)\n6.1 Research Purposes and Usefulness\n\nEven by those within psychiatry, it has been widely concluded that as\ntools for research, the prevailing classifications are flawed,\nproducing findings that tend to be inconsistent, non-replicable,\nnon-specific, or ambiguous, with the categories involved exhibiting\nproblems of construct and predictive validity, as well as imprecise\nphenotypic definitions, widespread heterogeneity, and extensive\ncomorbidity (Cuthbert & Insel 2013; Poland 2014; Poland & Von\nEckardt 2013; Tsou 2021). In partial defense of DSM-type\nclassifications, Elizabeth Lalumera points out that mental disorders\nmay correspond to theoretically informed and thus far incompletely\nunderstood concepts, in contrast to descriptive\nconceptions sufficient for identification practices in\ndiagnosis and care (Lalumera 2016)\n\nResearch-related concerns have led to the issuance of new, dimensional\ncriteria by which the research domain is to be approached (Revised\nDomain Criteria, or RDoC). Separate units of analysis (genes, cells,\ncircuits, self reports, etc.) are each employed in specific research\ndomains (such as positive and negative valence systems, cognitive\nsystems, systems for social processes, and arousal/regulatory\nsystems), and the intersections of units of analysis with research\ndomains produce segments of a spectrum linking normal and atypical\nfeatures. Whether RDoC\u2019s goals are entirely compatible has been\nquestioned, but the aim here is to promote both more accurate research\nand more effective treatments (Cuthbert & Insel 2013; Perring\n2016; Morris, Sanislow et. al. 2022). And while answering some of the\nconcerns about the earlier classificatory model, RDoC has in its turn\nbeen criticized: for its conception of validity; its assumptions about\nthe uniformity of normal distributions; its continuing acceptance of\nclinical and medical presuppositions assigning disorder to the\nindividual rather than the broader social context; its finding little\nplace for personal agency, and assuming a traditional, individualistic\nand autonomous model of self challenged by today\u2019s philosophical\nanalyses. (See essays in Poland & Tekin 2017; Tabb 2019.)\n6.2 Categorical and Dimensional Approaches\n\nPsychiatric classifications have often adhered, entirely or in part,\nto a nineteenth century, Kraepelinian model, where each disease is a\ndiscretely bounded entity, made up of a symptom cluster emanating from\nunderlying organic states or processes within the individual patient.\nBut the applicability of this model to mental disorder has been\nchallenged. Some would replace its idea of validity (involving a\nrelation between classificatory name and underlying disease) with the\nstatistical concept of predictive or prognostic validity, which\nproceeds without reference to underlying causes. Rather than\ndiscretely bounded, many disorders appear to be continuous with normal\nstates, and in an interpretive and definitional choice, over which the\ndata remains ambiguous, mental disorders arguably represent no more\nthan tails of normal distributions of particular traits in the general\npopulation \u2013 although the uniformity of these normal\ndistributions has also been questioned (Zachar 2014;Poland & Tekin\n2017; Machery 2017).\n\nSome diagnostic conditions (post-traumatic stress disorder, most\nunarguably) apparently arise from their subject\u2019s surrounding\nsocial, economic, and cultural context. Even those with more claim to\nidiopathic genetic, neurological, or biological causes as predisposing\nfactors are recognized to exhibit a course more strongly influenced by\nenvironmental and epigenetic than any fixed inherent factors \u2013\nthus putting further pressure on the \u201ccommon cause\u201d\nhypothesis, whereby a syndrome is explained by a single inherent\nfeature or set of features (Borsboom & Cramer 2013). Solely\ninternal, organic states and processes, and genes, cannot alone\nexplain all, and probably any, diagnostic disorders.\n\nWith their hypothesized common causes awaiting discovery, categorical\nanalyses present problems (such as the risk that allied symptoms may\nnot prove to emanate from a single common cause). But dimensional\napproaches make more evident the so-called boundary problem (Rashed\n2021) of where to assign the line between normal variation and\ndisorder. Theoretically, the \u201ccommon cause\u201d in categorical\nanalyses serves as an anchor uniting the often disparate and variable\nobservable symptoms making up a given disorder. (It is a feature that\njustifies the nomological approach of diagnostic classifications.)\nAside from this theoretical solution, categorical models are similarly\nbeset by boundary (fuzzy edges) problems. The presence of disorder is\npreceded and followed by a halo of prodromal and postdromal symptoms,\nover which clinical (and everyday) judgements are often unresolved.\nThese boundary issues remain regardless of the model adopted. In an\nexplicitly normative attempt to resolve an aspect of the boundary\nproblem as it occurs in social and political contexts, Mohammed Rashed\nemploys criteria governing recognition of social identities as a guide\nto pathological status (Rashed 2019, 2021).\n\nExpanding with each new addition, the collection of disorders\nenumerated and described in psychiatric classifications has prompted\nalarm over the boundaries of mental disorder, the erosion of normal,\nmentally healthy states and variations, and the inappropriate role\nplayed by medical psychiatry and, finally, science, in dictating norms\nof healthy psychic functioning. Philosophical criticisms of\n\u201cmedicalization\u201d emphasize the increasing influence of\nneuroscience in transforming cultural expectations and diminishing\nindividual agency, and the power over psychological norms exhibited by\nthe psychopharmacological industry (Phillips 2009, 2013; Rose &\nAbi-Rached 2013; Moncrieff 2008; Sadler 2005 , 2013, Whitaker &\nCosgrove 2015).\n\nIn contrast to these commonly-voiced apprehensions about\nover-medicalization, there remains the persistent charge of\nunder-diagnosis and under-treatment of those with\ndiagnosable mental disorder, often attributed to stigma, and to the\nsocioeconomic status of under-served communities. Epidemiological\nfindings about the incidence of disorder, as distinct from its\ndiagnosis, are notoriously insufficient, however, quite apart from a\nwant of independent biomarkers, due to self-stigma and fear of\ndiscrimination, for example, but also to distorting placebo effects,\nand to research methods misleadingly susceptible to false positives\n(Jopling 2009; Horwitz & Wakefield 2007; Poland & Von Eckardt\n2013)). The actual epidemiological data remains opaque and equivocal,\nleaving these contrary speculations unresolved and likely\nunresolvable.\n\nThe DSM and ICD diagnostic classifications have been remarkably\ninfluential worldwide: today, they appear almost immovably permanent.\nBut viewed within their broader moral, political, and social context,\nwhich includes psychiatry\u2019s apparently uneven provision of\neffective treatment, the appropriate stance to adopt towards them, as\nChristian Perring has pointed out, remains critical and skeptical\n(Perring 2016: 87).\n7. Natural Kind Status\n\nPhilosophers of science have explored whether all or some mental\nillnesses might be classified as natural kinds, the claim made about\nparticular diagnostic categories or symptom clusters (depression,\nschizophrenic disorder, and autism, for example), as well as about\nseparate symptoms (Cooper 2007; Samuels 2009; Tsou 2021). With\nrecognition that even the category of biological species would not\nmeet an essentialist criterion for natural kind status, a\n\u201chomeostatic property cluster\u201d account of natural kinds\nhas been proposed (Ellis 2001; Cooper 2007; Murphy 2012; Samuels\n2009). (See entry on Species.) A natural kind must be able to ground\nexplanations and inductive inferences, and enable effective human\nintervention. Linked by shared causal properties such as genes, on\nthis view, their homeostatic aspect ensures that property clusters\nmaking up separate disorders (or symptoms) will remain stable enough\nto behave the same way in response to the same conditions, due to a\nsimilarity-generating mechanism explaining their co-occurrence. (See\nessays in Kincaid and Sullivan 2014.)\n\nPsychological categories may resemble biological species in some\nrespects. But differences here have often been seen as profound, as\nthree examples will demonstrate. (i) Some have taken psychological\ncategories to represent a different order of being, as we saw in\n Section 5,\n with its own distinctive forms of causal explanations (Jaspers 1913\n[1963]; Bolton 2008; Wiggins & Schwartz 2011; Kusters 2016). (ii)\nOthers point out that psychological categories can alter, and\neventually even be altered by, the persons they classify, forming\n\u201cinteractive\u201d kinds through such looping effects. Indeed,\nmental disorders have been denied the status of natural kinds because\ninstability in their properties results when they have been classified\nand labeled (Hacking 1995). And (iii), some have tried to show that\nthe relation between mental illnesses and biological kinds differs\naccording to the role played by values in establishing the taxa of\nmental illness (Wakefield 1992; this claim is discussed in\n \u00a78).\n None of these differences has gone un-criticized. A thoroughgoing\nmind to brain reductionism would reject (i). About (ii), it has been\npointed out that the classification of biological species is also\nsubject to the instability wrought by looping effects (Khalidi 2010).\nAnd similarly, it has been argued in response to (iii) both that\nvalues also enter into the classification of biological species, and\nthat once we reach the categories of interest in this analysis,\nnon-evaluative traits form the observable taxa of such species (Cooper\n2007).\n\nAlthough the diverse ends to which disorder taxonomies can be put\nargue against finding a single answer about the kind status of mental\ndisorders, focus on the purposes served by disorder language and\ncategories has proven fruitful, here. (i) Mental disorders have been\nassigned to a category of \u201cpractical kinds\u201d, where\nmembership in this class depends on some external criterion that is\npragmatically relevant in the clinical context, such as a certain\ndegree of functional impairment, and remains unrelated to the\nunderlying structure of the kind (Zachar 2014). Moreover, they may be\nfurther classified according to their status as dimensional, discrete,\nand fuzzy kinds, and there is little reason to suppose that each and\nall conform to any one of these (Haslam 2002, 2014). (ii) Whether or\nnot they exhibit the stability required of classifications into true\nnatural kinds, these disorders do possess the properties relevant, and\nsufficiently stable, to guide clinical treatment, \u015eerife Tekin\nillustrates, using the lack of illness awareness\n(\u201cinsight\u201d) common in patients with some diagnoses (Tekin\n2016).\n8. Values and Mental Disorder\n\nValues have unfailingly played a part in the way mental disorders are\nclassified, conceptualized, experienced as personal diagnosis, and\ntreated. Philosophical accounts differ over the possibility of a\nvalue-free science of psychiatry (these are considered in\n \u00a78.1).\n Values also affect societal and personal attitudes towards disorder\nand diagnosis, in ways that are more immediate, considerably more\nurgent, and morally consequential (see\n \u00a78.2).\n Some of these issues are dealt with in bioethical research directed\nspecifically towards psychiatry\n (\u00a78.3).\n8.1 Evaluativism (Normativism) and Objectivism (Naturalism)\n\nPresent day conceptions, classifications, and attributions of mental\ndisorder contain many values, some explicit, others implicit, some\nmoral, others non-moral. Unacceptable bias has been repeatedly\nidentified, exemplified in categories such as homosexuality (with its\nhomophobia), pre-menstrual syndrome (unwarrantedly assigning disorder\nstatus to normal function), masochistic personality disorder\n(pathologizing misogynist gender roles), and oppositional defiant\nconduct disorders (exhibiting racial bias) (Sadler 2005, 2013; Potter\n2014; Poland 2014, Gagn\u00e9-Julien). As in all medicine, the\nprefixes of \u201cillness\u201dand \u201cdisorder,\u201d like\n\u201cdisease,\u201d already declare values such as the preference\nfor health over ill-health. A theory of values based medicine (VBM)\nemphasizes that values over mental health are particularly\ncontentious, requiring distinctive forms of negotiation in clinical\npractice (Fulford 2004, 2014).\n\nThe central philosophical question is whether moral values are\ninescapably attached to the conceptualization and classification of\nmental disorders at the level of theorizing, forming an inherent part\nof their definition. Such \u201cevaluativism\u201d\n(\u201cnormativism\u201d, or \u201cconstructivism\u201d) is placed\nin contrast to \u201cobjectivism\u201d (\u201cnaturalism\u201d),\nwhich seeks a value-free account of mental disorder. Debates over\nthese questions have long dominated philosophical research on mental\ndisorder, many played out around attempts to define mental disorder in\nways that are value-free (see\n \u00a74).\n\nAs was shown\n (\u00a74.4),\n philosophical definitions aiming to avoid all values appeal to\nallegedly value-neutral statistical norms, and adaptive function,\nrespectively. The vulnerability in Boorse\u2019s (1997) statistical\ndefinition, where normal function is determined according to the\nperson\u2019s reference class identified by such criteria as age, and\nsex, lies both with assigning the appropriate reference class, a\nprocess that re-introduces values, and at the point on a continuous\ndistribution curve where deviance from the mean is granted the status\nof dysfunctional (Bolton 2008). Recognizing that a trait may be\ndysfunctional in evolutionary terms without being disvalued, and\ndisvalued without being evidence of dysfunction, Wakefield\u2019s\ntwo-part definition explicitly accommodates the evaluative element\nmarking the category. This attempt to provide a naturalistic and value\nfree evolution-based account of \u201cfunction\u201d and\n\u201cdysfunction\u201d has been subject to a range of damaging\nobjections, including the claim that with its preference for\nevolutionary fitness, biological dysfunction is not, as promised,\nvalue neutral, even in the first half of the definition. Discerning\nwhat would be the maximal response in terms of perpetuating the\nspecies represents another of these objections, since no agreed-upon\nconclusion about this can be drawn in a value-neutral, or perhaps any,\nway. (See Murphy & Stich 2000; Faucher & Forest 2021; Garson\n2022.) Critiques of more general disease definitions are also\napplicable mental disorder. (See Powell & Scarffe 2019.)\n\nEvaluativism and objectivism are customarily depicted as incompatible\ncontraries, although the different domains where claims about disorder\noccur (including ordinary usage; conceptually clean versions of\n\u201chealth\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d; the operationalization\nof dysfunction, and the justification for that operationalization),\nindicate need for a more nuanced analysis of the role of values in\nhealth and disease (Kingma 2014). The broad contrast between\nevaluativism and objectivism has also been resisted for other reasons.\nJudgments about mental disorder need not be entirely arbitrary and\nsubjective as long as those values are taken to be real features of\nthe world along the lines of McDowell\u2019s secondary property value\nrealism, for example. In this relaxed naturalism, objectivism merely\nmeans requiring no special subject for the disciplining, conception,\nand framing of judgments, and providing a contrast between correct and\nincorrect, or truth and falsity, for the relevant judgments (Thornton\n2007).\n8.2 Societal and Personal Attitudes Towards Disorder and Diagnosis\n\nThe present discussion concerns evaluations that are primarily\nnegative, although as we saw earlier, positive evaluations arise in\ntraditions valorizing madness, and many in the neuro-diversity\nmovement insist that autism spectrum and other mental disorders are\nunexceptional human variations analogous to differences of gender,\nwhich ought to be granted respectful accommodation, not clinical\ntreatment. (See Hoffman 2019; Chapman & Carel 2022.) Negative\nsocial attitudes towards observable disorder have led to stigma,\nself-stigma, and discrimination (Hinshaw 2009). The madman and\nmadwoman have been the subject of fear, misunderstanding,\ndisparagement and condemnation, their failings exaggerated and\nhumanity denied (Gilman 1985). With modernity, care and protection\napparently replaced earlier, moralistic and neglectful arrangements.\n(The reforms\u2019 real effects and costs remain an unsettled matter\nof historical\n debate.[7]\n ) At the same time formal exceptions and protections, such as the\ninsanity defense, recognized mental disorder as an exculpating excuse\nfor wrongdoing and negligence. Despite such attitudinal change,\nhowever, these issues around responsibility remain contentious and\nunresolved (Pouncey & Lukens 2010; Singh, Sinnott-Armstrong &\nSavulescu 2013; Schramme 2014).\n\nThe effect of diagnoses on those so distinguished has been\ndemonstrated to be extensive, often personally transformative, and\nusually not benign. The extent of these effects has drawn research\nattention to first-person report, and to the eloquent madness memoirs\nincreasingly available for study. It has led to theorizing within\nformal philosophical writing, and also within the rhetoric of social\nmovements and identity-focused political interest groups (see\n \u00a710).\n The Recovery movement, for example, stresses the way the self and\nidentity are diminished by diagnosis, which erodes and occludes\nequally important and more positive, attributes making up the whole\nperson. (See Davidson 2013.) Critiques of diagnosis place emphasis on\nits dehumanizing and \u201cobjectifying\u201d effects that,\nmagnified by stigmatizing societal attitudes, engender self-stigma (\nHoffman & Hansen 2017; Hinshaw 2009; Thornicroft 2006). More\nrecently, however, social media and our hyperconnected contemporary\nexistence are seen as issuing in a less stigmatizing and\ndiscriminatory world, where some particular disorder diagnoses form\nsocial identities (Sulik 2011).\n8.3 Psychiatric Bioethics and Neuroethics\n\nSocietal attitudes towards mental disorders, added to features\nassociated with such disorders themselves, have given rise to a\nbioethics differing in emphasis from that addressing ethical issues in\nmost of general medicine. Widespread stigma about such disorder raises\nextra privacy and confidentiality issues, for example. Because of the\npowerful and disruptive effects of the experience of disorder,\nconceptions of disorder, and its treatment are often linked to the\nself and identity of the subject in distinctive ways (Tekin 2019). The\ncompromised perceptual, affective, and reasoning capabilities that at\nleast temporarily mark severe disorder are seen to jeopardize the\nwidely-valued traits of rational autonomy, responsibility, and\ncoherent and unified personhood, leading to challenges over agency and\ndecisional capacity (Radoilska 2012; Sadler, Fulford, & van Staden\n2015). And most significantly, treatment regularly employs coercive\nmethods.\n\nThese coercive practices are judged of serious moral concern. For\nexample, coercive treatment seems to jeopardize rights proclaimed by\nthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with\nDisabilities (2006). Important philosophical issues here include\nwhether there are person-centered and more paternalist principles that\nwould respectively obviate, and justify, coercive treatment; how to\ndefine coercion; what constitutes valid consent; and links between\ncoercion and stigmatizing consequences (Kallert, Mezzich, &\nMonahan 2011; Szmukler 2016; Cratsley 2019; Pouncey & Mertz 2019).\nRecent theorizing addresses \u201cmental disorder\nexceptionalism\u201d (different treatment for mental and physical\nconditions), proposing tests for everyone with reduced capacity,\nregardless of cause (Szmukler & Dawson 2011).\n\nAside from legal and moral liability, disorders affecting volition (in\naddictive and compulsive behavior) have been considered in light of\nthe moral capacities associated with attributing full adult\nresponsibility. Efforts to ground the intuition that sufferers from\nthese conditions are less than fully responsible agents have appealed\nto \u201cdeep self\u201d and also \u201creasons\nresponsiveness\u201d theories of responsibility. Neither theory alone\nhas been found to readily accommodate the collection of symptoms\nassociated with this group of disorders (Schramme 2014; Summers &\nSinnott-Armstrong 2019).\n\nThe related field of neuroethics explores developments and prospects\nin neuroscience possessing increased urgency, or distinctive\nrelevance, for psychopathology. (See Bluhm, Jacobson, & Maibom\n2012; Roskies 2007; Glannon 2015; Caruso & Flanagan 2018.) For\nexample, encroachment on \u201cmental privacy\u201d can be expected\nto disproportionately affect those with stigmatized genders, disorders\nand symptoms; and a future can be envisioned in which the semantic\nauthority of first person symptom descriptions is undermined by\ndiagnoses independently verified through imaging or other technologies\n(Maibom 2012). More generally, this new knowledge seems likely to\nfoster a trend from the treatment of disorder to its prediction based\non observed risk factors, which in turn permits initiatives such as\nthe identification and treatment of early onset,\n\u201cprodromal\u201d conditions in younger subjects (children and\nyouth), likely affecting identity development and self-management\n(Broome, Fusar-Poli, & Wuyts 2013; Whitaker & Cosgrove 2015;\nRadden 2018). (See entries on Philosophy of Neuroscience, and\nNeuroethics.)\n\nResponsibility concepts, together with those around personhood,\nautonomy, diminished capacity and individual rights, make up an\ninescapable aspect of the broad field of psychiatric ethics. Areas of\nrecent research concern responsibility and blame. Attitudes of blame\nare customarily treated as an appropriate sequel to assigning\nresponsibility (Watson 2004), but Hanna Pickard uncouples\nresponsibility from blame. At least for the apparently willful\nbehavior of those diagnosed with disorders affecting agency, she\nargues, the proper stance for the care-giver is grounded in an\nempathic attitude that assigns responsibility without blaming, because\nit is one most conducive to improvement and recovery (Pickard\n2011).\n\nClosely related responsibility issues involve the personality\ndisorders which, due to their long-recognized relationship to more\nnormal character weaknesses, and their evidently dimensional nature,\nsit uneasily within psychiatric classifications (Sinnott-Armstrong\n2008; Pickard 2011, 2016). One DSM grouping (cluster B personality\ndisorders, including borderline, narcissistic and antisocial), are\nbetter approached using persuasion, and methods reminiscent of the\n\u201cmoral treatment\u201d of earlier times, Louis Charland argues\n(Charland 2004).\n\nPhilosophical challenges to customary moral, ethical, and medical\npresuppositions introduced in this section have been influenced by,\nand are difficult to separate from, critiques of medical psychiatry\nthat have taken place not only within academe, but also beyond it.\nThese are discussed in\n Section 10.\n9. Particular Psychopathologies\n\nWhile often more ambitious and encompassing, philosophical attempts to\ndefine or characterize mental disorder have also provided\nfiner-grained analyses.(See chapters in Fulford, Davies et al., 2013;\nMoseley & Gala 2016; and Tekin & Bluhm 2019.) Beyond research\ninto the symptom clusters classified as the schizophrenias, that are\nwidely regarded as candidates for some kind of natural kinds status,\nanalyses have been offered for anorexia and other eating\ndisorders (Gadsby 2017a, 2017b, 2020;Bordo 1993; Giordano 2005,\n2019; Svenaeus 2013; Morris 2013; Tan, Hope & Stewart 2003, Tan,\nStewart, Fitzpatrick & Hope 2010; Radden 2021); addiction\n(West 2006; Poland & Graham 2011; Flanagan 2017; Vohs &\nHeatherton 2000; Holton & Berridge 2013; Foddy & Savalescu\n2010; Summers 2015; Lewis 2015; Levy, 2006, 2011, 2013; Kennett 2013;\nSripada 2018; Westin 2020; Glacken, Roberts & Krueger 2021;\nPickard 2016); anti-social personality disorder\n(Sinnott-Armstrong 2008; Adshead 2013; Roskies 2003; Schramme 2014;\nLevy 2007;Kennett & Fine 2008; Maibom 2014; Justman 2021);\ndepressive and manic-depressive conditions (Varga 2016; Bluhm\n2011; Bluhm, Jacobson & Maibom 2012; Horwitz & Wakefield 2007;\nWakefield 2012; Bolton 2013; Hoffman & Hansen 2017; Ratcliffe\n& Stephan 2014; Browne 2018; Radden 2013; Radoilska 2012; Biegler\n2011; Fuchs 2001, 2005, 2013); scrupulosity, Obsessive-Compulsive\nand other volitional disorders (Glas, 2013; Szalai 2016; Summer\n& Sinnott-Armstrong 2019); anxiety (Horwitz &\nWakefield 2012); autism spectrum conditions (Adams 2013;\nBaron-Cohen, Lombardo & Tager-Flusberg 2013); disorders of\ndissociation (Worrell & Denham 2016; Maiese 2016); Defiant\nDisorder (Potter 2014); Borderline Personality Disorder (Potter 2009)\nand Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (Gagn\u00e9-Julien\n2021).\n\nThe category of psychosis, employed for extreme states of disorder\naffecting perceptual capabilities (in hallucinations) and reasoning\n(in delusions and other cognitive defects) have received considerable\nphilosophical attention. With almost unfailing consequences for their\nsubject in clinical, legal, social, and personal settings, the\nseverity of hallucinations and delusions serves to distinguish them\nfrom many of the general controversies about disorder noted thus far.\nThe incidence of and pathology associated with hallucinations has been\nquestioned, as has their origins, and phenomenology (Leudar &\nThomas 2000; Ratcliffe 2017; Henriksen, Raballo, & Parnas 2015).\nAnd delusions have attracted the particular attention of philosophers\nfor their incomprehensibility, and challenge to theories about\nmeaning, language, belief, and intention (Coltheart & Davies 2000;\nFletcher & Frith 2009; Bortolotti 2009, 2020; Miyazono 2019; Evans\n2022). They have also been the impetus for important collaborative\nwork between several sciences: in addition to being psychiatric\ndisorders delusions occur as symptoms of neurological diseases of and\ninjury to the brain, and as such have been subject to considerable\nempirical study. Philosophical research on delusions primarily\naddresses issues their intelligibility; their status in relation to\nmore normal doxastic states; and their place in explanatory\nmodels.\n\nThe intelligibility of delusions remains contested. Delusions are\nexpressed using unexceptional syntax, and some involve content that,\nwhile inaccurate or implausible, is entirely comprehensible. These,\nJaspers insisted, are secondary delusions; primary delusions, in\ncontrast, are distinguished by their meaninglessness: attributing\nmeaning to them is a misapplication of the hermeneutic approach\n(Jaspers 1913 [1963]; Gorski 2012). Others have adopted the position\nthat all delusions are meaningless utterances (Berrios 1991), and\nfindings in brain science have been employed to confirm that (Gerrans\n2014). In contrast, it is argued that delusions are always\ncomprehensible, but only within a context that includes the\nperson\u2019s whole life, ideas and values, and recognizing\nnon-literal interpretation (Bentall 2004; Wickham & Bentall 2016,\nMullen & Gillett 2014; Glover 2014; Jeppsson 2021; Gipps\n2022).\n\nDelusions are belief-like, but disagreements arise over whether they\nare beliefs, imaginings, an incomplete form of one of these two, or a\ndistinct hybrid form. The doxastic position (delusions are beliefs)\nmust somehow accommodate that compared to typical beliefs, delusions\nare not responsive to countervailing evidence, and are only weakly\nbehavior guiding. (See Flores 2021 and entry for Delusions.)\nAssociated more with imagining than with believing, these same\nfeatures have led to the assertion that delusions are imaginings\nmistakenly identified as beliefs (Currie & Ravenscroft 2002;\nBroome & Bortolotti 2009), or the hybrid concept of\n\u201cbimagining\u201d (Egan 2009).\n\nIncreasingly, explanations of delusions are multi-factorial.\nInfluential early models that grew out of research on single-themed\ndelusions resulting from brain damage, such as Capgras, hypothesized\ntwo deficiencies: an initiating aberrant experience or perception due\nto brain dysfunction, combined with some failure of the system of\n\u201cbelief fixation\u201d by which initial beliefs are critically\nreviewed in light of other information (Davies et al. 2001; Davies\n& Davies 2009; Young 2011). The second factor in such \u201ctwo\nfactor\u201d theories is faulty inference, and is on some accounts\ndistinguished by degree alone from common forms of reasoning error\nsuch as attribution bias (Bentall 2004). On \u201cprediction\nerror\u201d models, perceptual aberrations conflict with prior\n(Bayesian) expectations when accompanied by reasoning bias, giving\nrise to delusions (Stone & Young 2007; Mishara & Corlett\n2009). The \u201cpolythematic\u201d and complex delusions more often\nseen in the psychiatry clinic, that are partially driven by social and\nenvironmental factors, present significant challenges for cognitive\nscience, since they involve the higher cognitive systems that\napparently resist modular analysis and decomposition.\n10. Anti-psychiatry, Feminist Theory, Post- and Critical- Psychiatry, Neurodiversity and Identity Politics\n10.1 Anti-psychiatry\n\n\u201cAnti-psychiatry\u201d has come to stand for ideas from\nmid-twentieth century thinkers such as Thomas Szasz, R.D. Laing, and\nMichel Foucault. Many of these involved social and political critiques\nand calls to action, with real-world consequences that have been\nlinked to deinstitutionalization, human rights movements, and a shift\ntowards more autonomy-focused mental health care. In English language\ntheorizing Szasz and Laing rejected the appropriateness of analogizing\nparticular \u201cproblems in living\u201d (Szasz) with medical\ndisorders, insisting that misapplication of the medical model to\nmental health was emblematic of the overreach of the medical\nestablishment. The practices and discourses within society and its\ninstitutions making up the era\u2019s episteme are depicted\nhistorically by Foucault, the focus on the exercise of psychiatric\npower that, arising with modern science, is increasingly exerted\nthrough mechanisms of protection, surveillance, and control. With\nmodernity, on this account, power is no longer brute force. Instead,\nit takes a more diffused and subtle form that imperceptibly\ndisciplines and controls not only bodies, but selves (Foucault 1965,\nBracken & Thomas 2010, 2013; Rose 2010; Iliopoulos 2012).\nFoucault\u2019s sweeping ideas remain central to the \u201cpost\npsychiatry\u201d and \u201ccritical psychiatry\u201d that have\nemerged during the beginning of the twenty-first century.\n10.2 Feminist Theory\n\nInterwoven with these ideas from the start have been critiques from\nfeminism and feminist theory. These include acknowledgment of the\nwomen\u2019s actual, unwarranted, institutionalization, as well as\nemphasis on harms of disempowerment and silencing (Kristeva 1987\n[1989]), and of epistemic injustices (Dotson 2011; Kidd, Spencer &\nCarel 2022; and see entry on Feminist Social Epistemology). In a\nlegacy affecting mental disorder even today, binary conceptualizations\nhave assigned women and the feminine to illogicality, emotionality,\nsubjectivity, the bodily, and madness, in contrast to men\u2019s more\nvalued traits (G. Lloyd 1984; Potter 2009). Feminist thinkers have\nfocused on the medicalization of women\u2019s normal traits, as well\nas research neglect and distortion of gender-linked disorders;\nseparate and unequal treatments; the mental health vulnerabilities\nassociated with traditional women\u2019s roles and identities; and\ndiagnosis and treatment understood as tools of patriarchal social\ncontrol (Russell 1995; Ussher 2011; Gagn\u00e9-Julien 2021).\n\nFeminism has consistently rejected traditional causal explanations of\nwomen\u2019s disorder derived from allegedly natural biological\npredispositions, pointing instead to the effects of women\u2019s\noppressive socialization and to the consequences of devaluing\nwomen\u2019s characteristics and abilities (Bluhm 2011). Similarly,\nit has emphasized the embodiment, and relationality, of the self and\navoided the methodological individualism associated with psychiatric\nmedicine (Bluhm, Jacobson, & Maibom 2012). Influenced by social\ntheory and phenomenological approaches, more recent work focuses on\nthe intersection of gender with marginality, invisibility,\nnon-normativity and oppression in lived experience (Nissim-Sabat 2013;\nZeiler & Folkmarson K\u00e4ll 2014).\n10.3 Post and Critical Psychiatry\n\nObjections to the modernist presuppositions of psychiatry also take\nissue with the model by which disorder reflects flawed brain\nmechanisms or processes, serving to enhance the status of psychiatry\nand disempower those diagnosed with disorder (Bracken & Thomas\n2005, Iliopoulos 2012). The new brain sciences will magnify this\ndisempowerment, it is argued, with the agency and authority previously\nattributed to persons replaced by a bio-scientific \u201cmanagement\nof the mind\u201d (Phillips 2009, 2013; Rose and Abi-Rached 2013). A\nmore recent descendant of mid-twentieth century writing is the\ncollection of concerns known as critical psychiatry: critiques of the\ninfluence of the pharmacological industry (Phillips 1996, 2013;\nMoncrieff 2008; Whitaker & Cosgrove 2015; Karp 2017); a discourse\naround mental disorder that, influenced by hermeneutics, aims to be\nmore sensitive to the meaning of symptoms (Bracken & Thomas 2010);\nand the promotion of a more equal and collaborative relationship\nbetween carers and those they treat (Double 2006; Cohen & Timimi\n2008).\n\nAssociated with these ideas is growing recognition of the unique\nexpertise of \u201cservice users\u201d or \u201csurvivors\u201d\nfor understanding mental disorder, and the importance of its inclusion\nfor research (Faulkner & Leyzell 2000; Gergel 2012; Cooper 2017;\nBueter 2018). These innovations have been analyzed appealing to\ncritical theory, narrative research methods, the impediments to\nrepresentational authority, and the co-production of knowledge\n(Voronka 2016; Russo & Sweeney 2016).\n10.4 Neurodiversity\n\nAs the most recent among this range of broadly \u2018anti\npsychiatry\u2019 positions, neurodiversity offers a coherent account\nand has come of age within a cultural episteme that seems\nhospitable to it. Mental differences, it asserts, are equally natural\nand valuable, and no one type of functioning is more correct or valid\nthan another. Analogies are drawn with differences of gender,\nethnicity and culture, including analogies involving social power\ninequalities. From its ready application to disorders on the autism\nspectrum, efforts have been made to apply the neurodiversity position\nmore broadly, including to the symptoms of schizophrenia. (See Chapman\n2019, Chapman & Carel 2022.)\n10.5 Identity Politics\n\nClaims arising from political movements made up of recipients of\npsychiatric care call for a seat at the policy-makers\u2019 table;\nrepresentational authority in the co-production of knowledge based on\nfirst person experience of psychiatric symptoms and treatment;\nattention to complaints of unjust treatment by the\n\u201csurvivors\u201d of diagnosis and care; equality of mental with\nother disabilities, and or mental with other medical conditions;\nrecognition of neuro-atypicality from proponents of a neurodiversity\nmodel of disorder (Ortega 2009; Polvora 2011); and from \u201cmad\npride\u201d, the claim that madness is an attribution from which to\ndraw strength and cultural identity. Largely neglected until now\nwithin psychiatry or philosophical writing, the claims of mad pride\nhave recently been critically evaluated and related to the social\ntheory of philosophers like Honneth and Taylor (Rashed 2019,\n2021).\n11. Future Prospects\n\nWhere might we expect philosophical work on mental disorder to go from\nhere? One issue must be what role or roles remain for conceptual\napproaches and commonsense psychology, and for the related tug of war\nover who decides mental health \u2013 modern science, and the\nmerciless dictates of evolutionary biology, or some richer eudaemonic\nvision? Even granted the authority to determine ideals of mental\nhealth, philosophers would encounter hard questions. How to relinquish\nevaluative thinking in view of liberal traditions around\nresponsibility and self identity? How generously to attribute normalcy\nand diversity, rather than deficiency, and how to navigate at the\nboundary of disorder and risk? New ways to understand, verify and\nameliorate mental disorders together with big data on their incidence\nand circumstances, and the challenges introduced by the new\nhyperconnectedness and biomedicalization of society can only augment\nand extend such questions, perhaps in directions barely dreamed\nof.\n",
