    "main_text": "The Instant of Change\n4. The Instant of Change\n\n\nConsider a car moving off from rest at exactly noon. What is its\nstate of motion at the instant of change? If it is in motion, when\ndid it start? And if it is motionless, when could it ever begin? This\nproblem was explored by Medlin (1963), Hamblin (1969), and\nothers. Put this way, a solution for at least some special cases is\nreadily available. Locate the time origin \\(t = 0\\) at noon. If\nthe car\u2019s position function \\(f\\) is given by, say,\n\\(f(t) = t^{2}\\), then its speed is\n\\(2t\\). If motion is defined as having non-zero speed, then the\ncar is motionless at \\(t=0\\). On the other hand, at all\n\\(t \\gt 0\\) it is in motion, so there is surely no puzzle about\nwhen it could ever begin: there is no first instant of motion.\n\n\nHowever, there are more troublesome special cases. Suppose that the\ncar\u2019s position function is given by: \\(f(t)=0\\) for all \\(t \\lt\n0\\), else \\(f(t)=t\\). Then speed is zero for all \\(t \\lt 0\\), and\nspeed is 1 for all \\(t \\gt 0\\). But what of \\(t = 0\\)? One should\navoid \u201carbitrary\u201d solutions, which attribute one speed\nrather than another, but do not give a reason for so\nprivileging. There is of course at least one simple solution that is\nnon-arbitrary, namely that it is neither in motion nor motionless,\nsince its speed is indeterminate at \\(t = 0\\).  This solution derives\nfrom the fact that according to classical calculus there is no\nderivative of such a function at \\(t = 0\\).\n\n\nBut can we do no better? The present author (1985) proposed to set\naside the problem until more is said about various possible\nconstraints on the solution. Unless we had some reason to think that\nsuch functions really did describe the world, we might well feel that\na solution was less than imperative and less than unique. For\nexample, the world might be described wholly with \\(C^{\\infty}\\)\nfunctions \\((n\\)-th derivatives exist for all \\(n\\), e.g.,\ncos, sin, log, exponential functions). The above function is not\namong these, since its derivative is discontinuous. But then it isn\u2019t\nclear what we might say of it if the example is counterfactual. There\nmight be different things to say depending on what further principles\ndescribe the possible world. Hence we would need to supplement the\noriginal statement of the problem with an argument to the effect that\nwe might expect such functions to describe the real world, or\nalternatively supply additional metaphysical principles to be\nregarded as constraints on the solution.\n\n\nA related problem is the fracture problem, described by\nMedlin. Imagine fracturing a material body such as a piece of wood,\nregarded as a plenum (full of matter). What is the state of the two\nnew surfaces after the fracture? Unless matter is to be created or\ndestroyed, we seem to have to say that the break is half-open, with\none new matter-surface being topologically closed and the other being\ntopologically open. But which surface is which? There seems to be no\nprinciple to determine which. In response, it can be asked how\nseriously we have to take the postulation of a plenum. If for example\nmatter is as Boscovich suggested, punctate and surrounded by fields,\nthen there are no plena, and the problem is no more than\nhypothetical. Or again, there might be plena but other principles\nmight apply. For example, mass-density functions might drop smoothly\nto zero at the boundaries between matter and empty space, which would\nmean that all surfaces were open. On the other hand, it might be\ninstead that as a matter of fact all surfaces are topologically\nclosed. This would need an inconsistent solution (see below, sections\n5\u20137).\n",
