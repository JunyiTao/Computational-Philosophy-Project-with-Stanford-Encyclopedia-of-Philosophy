Aesthetics, Ethics and Politics\n\nThe intersection between romantic aesthetics, ethics and politics\noffers a particularly clear challenge to the standard view of the\nromantics as anti-Enlightenment (discussed in\n \u00a72).\n This is because the romantics turned to aesthetics to a large extent\nin order to pursue, rather than to reject, some of the core ethical\nand political values of the Enlightenment, such as autonomy or\nself-determination and the ideal of Bildung. Art and\naesthetics also provided a model for the romantic political ideal: a\ndemocratic, egalitarian community grounded in the republican values of\nliberty, equality and fraternity.\n\nIn addition to proving the anti-Enlightenment interpretation of the\nromantics false, tracing these romantic notions of autonomy,\nBildung and political community also offers a challenge to\nanother well-known interpretation of the movement as apolitical (see\nSchmitt 1986). In contrast to this interpretation, we find the\nromantics exploring and emphasizing the importance of aesthetics for\nethical and political concerns. Shelley, for example, wrote in a\nletter to a friend: \u201cI consider Poetry subordinate to moral\n& political science\u201d (Shelley, LS 2: 71). In his famous\nDefence of Poetry (1821), he proclaimed, \u201cPoets are the\nunacknowledged legislators of the world\u201d (SPP). Rather than\n\u201caestheticizing\u201d politics, then, the romantics found in\nart and aesthetics resources for solving ethical and political\nproblems.\n\nYet, a central difficulty facing any interpretation of romantic ethics\nand politics lies in the change that this view has undergone during\nthe later years of many a romantic: the strong democratic and\negalitarian views of the likes of Friedrich Schlegel and Friedrich\nSchleiermacher gave way to a growing conservatism and religiosity\nafter 1800. The first generation of British romantics likewise turned\nfrom their conviction that to be young during the revolution was, as\nWordsworth said, \u201cbliss\u201d and \u201cheaven\u201d, to an\nacknowledgement of the challenges awaiting a genuine political reform.\nWith this shift in mind, they turned from political optimism to\nreligion. A unified account of romantic politics is thus untenable.\nInstead, the section will focus on the political views of the German\nromantics during their \u201cformative years\u201d (from\n1797\u20131800) and of the British romantics mainly during their\nearly and middle phases This is because the ideals developed during\nthese phases, though different from some of the later ideals, can shed\nlight on the romantic path towards conservatism later on (Beiser\n1992).\n \u00a74.5\n will briefly present the romantics\u2019 later political\nthought.\n",
