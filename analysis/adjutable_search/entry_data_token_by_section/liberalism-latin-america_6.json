The Influence of Positivism\n\nIn the closing decades of the nineteenth century, there took place a\nfusion of liberalism with positivism in some parts of Latin America.\n\u201cPositivism\u201d was the name for a scientific approach to the\nsolution of social and political problems that was based on experience\nand observation. As developed by Auguste Comte in his Course of\nPositive Philosophy, positivism claimed that it was possible to\nuncover the laws of social phenomena and to organize society according\nto them. Comte\u2019s thesis that it was possible to combine liberty\nwith order and progress exerted great influence in Latin America along\nwith Herbert Spencer\u2019s evolutionism. While some liberals, such\nas Victorino Lastarria in Chile, sought to reconcile individual\nfreedom with positivist philosophy, some others, such as Justo Sierra\nin Mexico, frankly subordinated individual liberty to the maintenance\nof social order. Comtean philosophy was most influential in the field\nof higher education, where social reformers introduced new curricula\nthat privileged the study of the empirical sciences. Such innovations\nwere intended for the education of the elites. Educators believed,\nfollowing Comte, that the key to ending social disorder was mental\norder: education was instrumental to ending mental anarchy by\nemancipating individuals from prejudice and introducing them to\n\u201ca common reservoir of truths\u201d (Zea 1968: 125). However,\nHispanic American educators inspired by Comte did not embrace his\nreligion of humanity. The latter had the greatest impact in Brazil,\nwhere positivism displaced liberalism.\n\nJos\u00e9 Victorino Lastarria (1817\u20131888) was the most prominent\nChilean liberal intellectual in the nineteenth century. He was a\nlawyer, a public intellectual, a central literary figure, and a\npolitician who held official positions. His thinking was importantly\ninfluenced by John Stuart Mill\u2019s rendering of positivist\nphilosophy in his Auguste Comte and Positivism, and by\n\u00c9mile Littr\u00e9, who popularized Comte\u2019s positivism.\nAlong with Federico Errazuriz, Lastarria wrote the \u201cBasis for\nReform\u201d (1850), which is a liberal manifesto containing the much\ndesired reforms to the conservative Chilean constitution of 1833.\nAbove all, they demanded the protection of individual liberties and\nlimits to the executive power but did not call for universal male\nsuffrage. Instead, this liberal program endorsed literacy requirements\nfor voting. When liberals came to power in 1861 they took the path of\nconstitutional reform instead of drafting a new constitution. As has\nbeen noted, Chilean liberals privileged the way of reform, as opposed\nto revolution, to press for their own political ends (Jaksic and\nSerrano 2011, Jocelyn-Holt 1998).\n\nLastarria\u2019s most important theoretical work is Lessons in\nPositivist Politics (Lecciones de pol\u00edtica\npositiva) published in 1875. The influence of positivism is\nmanifest in this work. By contrast with Comte, however, Lastarria was\na thorough individualist who extolled the perfection of the individual\nand the value of individual liberty. He refused to subordinate\nindividual liberty to social order and maintained throughout his\npolitical writings that society should protect the full exercise of\nindividual liberty. The central idea that Lastarria took from Comte is\nthe thesis that modern societies need to be guided by experience and\nscientific observation. According to this, politics must be an\nexperimental science based on experience and observation, which are\nthe only solid basis for social organization. Following Comte,\nLastarria maintained that it is possible to comprehend society\u2019s\nprogressive movement by uncovering the laws that govern social\nphenomena. On his view, in order to examine a particular form of\nsocial organization, it is necessary first to determine the laws that\ngovern humanity\u2019s progress. The most fundamental law that\nLastarria identifies and that, according to him, impulses humanity\nforward, is \u201cmoral liberty\u201d: the tendency to augment and\ndevelop all of our faculties (Lecciones, 3rd\nLesson). Social progress, on his view, is a product of this\ndevelopment. This is a perfectionist conception of the human person\naccording to which perfection is not only an individual end but also\nthe most important social end.\n\nLastarria conceived of his own epoch as one of painful transition\ntowards the triumph of liberty. Following Comte, he subscribed to the\nview that society progresses through three stages: theological,\nmetaphysical, and positive. At the theological stage, society is\nsubject to the authority of spiritual dogmas and is governed by force.\nAccording to him, this is the most vicious state because it is\ncontrary to man\u2019s moral nature and stops social development. He\nassociates the metaphysical stage with the French spirit and\ncriticizes it for its anarchy and confusion. In particular, Lastarria\ncriticizes the revolutionary conception of liberty as popular\nsovereignty which he regards as an absolute power incompatible with\nthe rights of man, properly understood. The attack against the old\ntheological order and the anarchy in the ideas characterize the epoch\nof transition towards a third, positive, stage. He identifies the\nlatter as \u201cliberal\u201d insofar as it is founded on human\nliberty, which, on his view, is ideally exercised in what he calls\n\u201csemecracia\u201d (self-government). By the latter he not only\nmeans individual self-government but also government of the people by\nthe people, which he saw realized in the North American republic that\nhe greatly admired.\n\nLastarria maintained that liberty consists in the exercise of various\nrights: the right to make decisions about one\u2019s own person\n(personal liberty), the right to exercise one\u2019s own intelligence\nand to examine received beliefs, the right to work and to acquire\nproperty, the right to associate with others, and the right to demand\nequality before the law (Lecciones, 5th Lesson).\nHe was particularly concerned with freedom of religious worship. He\nheld religion to be a fundamental idea in society but also an intimate\nand private one. Following the example of North America, he advocated\nthe separation of church and State both in order to maintain the\nindependence of the church in the carrying out of its spiritual\nmission and the neutrality of the State with respect to religious\ndogma. As many other Hispanic American liberals, Lastarria established\na connection between freedom of thought and freedom of teaching: on\nhis view, just as the State should abstain from favoring any religious\ndoctrine in particular, the State should also refrain from imposing\nany political doctrine through official schooling. Though this view\npushes towards the disappearance of official schooling, he granted\nthat the State had a duty to finance basic schooling but should leave\nall other instruction in private hands.\n\nLastarria\u2019s individualism was an exception among those Hispanic\nAmerican liberals who subscribed to positivist philosophy. The latter\ncame to see society as an organism, of which the individual is a part,\nsubject to fixed laws that determine its development. In their defense\nof a scientific approach to social problems that was based on\nobservation and experience, they claimed that law had to be adjusted\nto social reality, not the other way around. They thus rejected the\n\u201cutopias\u201d of earlier liberals and came to regard the\n\u201cold\u201d defense of natural rights and popular sovereignty as\nmetaphysical abstractions that were out of touch with reality. In the\nextreme, positivist liberals sided with the defense of authoritarian\ngovernments in the name of order and progress. In Mexico, positivist\nphilosophy became the official creed of the governing elite, the so\ncalled \u201cscientists\u201d, who did not repudiate their liberal\ncredentials. Their positivist version of liberalism, which they called\n\u201cconservative\u201d liberalism, served as the ideological\nframework for the justification of dictatorial rule. In Brazil, by\ncontrast, positivism displaced liberalism as the ideology of the\nruling elite with the fall of the monarchy and the advent of the\nrepublic in 1889 through a military coup. As has been maintained,\nBrazilian republicans, in their attacks to the oligarchy and distrust\nof the masses, were attracted to the positivist idea that\nscientifically grounded social reform had to be carried out by a\ntechnocratic elite (Krebs 2002: 269).\n",
