We suppose that what the\norganism does in each state makes a difference to its fitness.\nFitnesses are usually written characterized by a matrix \\(W\\). \n\nThe individual elements of the matrix \\(W_{ij}\\) are the fitness\nconsequences of response \\(i\\) in state \\(j\\). So, for instance,\n\\(W_{21}\\) denotes the fitness consequences of \\(R_2\\) in \\(S_1\\). If\nwe let \\(W_{11}\\) and \\(W_{22}\\) equal one and \\(W_{12}\\) and\n\\(W_{21}\\) equal zero, then there is a clear evolutionary advantage to\nperforming \\(R_1\\) in \\(S_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) in \\(S_2\\).\n\nHowever, the organism must first detect the state of the environment,\nand detectors are not in general perfectly reliable. If the organism\nresponds automatically to the detector, we can use the probabilities\nof responses given states to characterize the reliability of the\ndetector. We write the probability of \\(R_1\\) given \\(S_1\\) as\n\\(\\Pr(R_1 \\mid S_1)\\). This allows us to calculate that responding to\nthe detector rather than always choosing \\(R_1\\) or \\(R_2\\) will be\nadvantageous just in case the following inequality holds (cf.\nGodfrey-Smith 1996): \n\\[\n\\frac{\\Pr(R_2 \\mid S_2)}{1-\\Pr(R_1 \\mid S_1)} \\gt \n\\frac{\\Pr(S_1)(W_{11}-W_{21})}{(1-\\Pr(S_1))(W_{22}-W_{12})}\n\\]\n\n\nThis simple model demonstrates that whether or not flexible responses\nare adaptive depends on the particular characteristics of the fitness\ndifferences that the responses make, the probability of the various\nstates of the environment, and the reliability of the detector. The\nparticular result is calculated assuming that detecting the\nenvironmental state and the flexible response system is free in\nevolutionary terms. More complete analyses would include the costs of\nthese factors.\n\nStatic optimization models like the one outlined above can be extended\nin several ways. Most obviously, the number of environmental states\nand organismic responses can be increased, but there are other\nmodifications that are more interesting. Signal detection theory, for\ninstance, models the detectors and cues in more detail. In one\nexample, a species of \u201csea moss\u201d detects the presence of\npredatory sea slugs via a chemical cue. They respond by growing\nspines, which is costly. The cue in this case, the water-borne\nchemical, comes in a variety of concentrations, which indicate various\nlevels of danger. Signal detection theory allows us to calculate the\nbest threshold value of the detector for the growing of\nspines.\n\nStatic models depict evolutionary processes in terms of fitness costs\nand benefits. They are static in the sense that they model no actual\nprocess, but merely calculate the direction of change for different\nsituations. If fitness is high, a type will increase, if low it will\ndecrease. When fitnesses are equal, population proportions remain at\nstable equilibrium. Dynamic models typically employ the kinds of\ncalculations involved in static models to depict actual change over\ntime in population proportions. Instead of calculating whether change\nwill occur and in what direction, dynamic models follow change.\n",
