    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nAt least two central tendencies are evident in VE taken as a\nwhole.\n\nOne central tendency is to view epistemology as a normative\ndiscipline. This implies at least two things. First, it signals\nopposition to Quine\u2019s radical suggestion in \u201cEpistemology\nNaturalized\u201d that philosophers should abandon questions about\nwhat\u2019s reasonable to believe, and should restrict themselves to\nquestions about cognitive psychology instead. Virtue epistemologists\nreject this proposal (McDowell 1994: 133; Sosa 1991: 100\u2013105;\nZagzebski 1996: 334\u20138). Nevertheless, they are generally\nreceptive to empirical data from psychology, history, and other fields\n(e.g., Greco 2001; Roberts & Wood 2007: Part II; Sosa 1991:\n105\u20136; Zagzebski 1996: 336\u20137). Second, it implies that\nepistemologists should focus their efforts on understanding epistemic\nnorms, value, and evaluation. This is a defining feature of the field.\nAccordingly, VE features centrally in the recent \u201cvalue\nturn\u201d in epistemology (Riggs 2006; Pritchard 2007).\n\nFor some practitioners, however, the idea that epistemology is a\nnormative discipline means more than this. For example, some think\nthat epistemological terms (or concepts) like \u2018knowledge\u2019,\n\u2018evidence\u2019, \u2018justification\u2019,\n\u2018duty\u2019 and \u2018virtue\u2019 cannot be adequately\ndefined or fully explained in purely non-normative vocabulary (e.g.,\nAxtell & Carter 2008; McDowell 1994; Roberts & Wood 2007; and\nZagzebski 1996, 2009), although others disagree (e.g., Goldman 1992;\nGreco 1999, 2009; Sosa 2007).\n\nOthers think that epistemology should aim to promote intellectual well\nbeing. Perhaps an epistemological theory should be \u201cpractically\nuseful\u201d in helping us recognize when we do or don\u2019t know\nsomething (Zagzebski 1996: 267), or help us overcome\n\u201canxieties\u201d due to defective presuppositions about\nknowledge (McDowell 1994: xi; Pritchard 2016a). Perhaps epistemology\nshould help us appreciate and respond to forms of \u201cepistemic\ninjustice\u201d (Fricker 2007). Perhaps epistemology should inspire\nus with portraits of intellectual virtues, thereby promoting cultural\nreformation and intellectual flourishing (Roberts & Wood 2007).\nPerhaps epistemology should examine intellectual vices and other\ndefects to tell cautionary tales of what not to do and how not to be\n(Alfano 2015, Battaly 2014, Cassam 2016). Or perhaps practitioners\nshould help redesign educational institutions to help students\ncultivate intellectual virtues (e.g., the Intellectual Virtues\nAcademy\u2014see Other Internet Resources).\n\nThe other central tendency is to view intellectual agents and\ncommunities as the primary source of epistemic value and the primary\nfocus of epistemic evaluation. This focus includes not only\nindividuals and groups, but also the traits constitutive of their\ncognitive character.\n\nThis second commitment of VE is often accompanied by a\n\u201cdirection of analysis\u201d characteristic of virtue theories\nin both ethics and epistemology. Virtue ethics explains an\naction\u2019s moral properties in terms of the agent\u2019s\nproperties, such as whether it results from kindness or spite. VE\nexplains a cognitive performance\u2019s normative properties in terms\nof the cognizer\u2019s properties, such as whether a belief results\nfrom hastiness or excellent eyesight, or whether an inquiry manifests\ncarelessness or discrimination. For virtue ethics the relevant\nproperties are moral traits, and for VE intellectual traits.\n\nBeyond those basic central tendencies, we find great diversity in the\nfield. Four main issues divide practitioners. The first concerns the\nnature and scope of intellectual virtues (section 3). The second\nconcerns what questions to address (section 4). The third concerns\nwhat methods to use (sections 4 and 9). The fourth concerns the\nrelations among epistemic virtue, knowledge, and epistemic credit\n(sections 5, 6, and 7).\n",
