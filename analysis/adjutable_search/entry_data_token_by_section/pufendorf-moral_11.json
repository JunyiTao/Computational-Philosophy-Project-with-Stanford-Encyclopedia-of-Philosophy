    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || Natural Law and History\n4.3 Natural Law and History\n\nPufendorf\u2019s natural law thinking developed in close interaction\nwith his views on other subjects such as history, religion, and\ninternational relations; that is, his roles as academic philosopher,\ncourt historian, and political apologist were only formally and not\nintellectually distinct (Seidler 2015). This is as evident in the\nseminal reflections of his early Collegium Anthologicum\nlectures (in KVS 1995e, pp. 2\u201386) as it is in his later works.\nThus, the 1667 treatise on the Holy Roman Empire (Monz.) not only\nstudied its concrete history and institutions but also examined the\nimportance of sovereignty and state form, the tension between civil\nand ecclesiastical authority, and the challenge of foreign relations\nthat emerged from these. Pufendorf\u2019s so-called works on religion\n(Habitu; Feciale; Einl. [1691b, 1714, 1839]) engaged the same topics,\nas well as associated questions about religious unification and\ntoleration, in the context of the early modern confessional state\n(Parkin and Stanton 2013; D\u00f6ring 1998; Zurbuchen 1999, 1996,\n1991; H\u00fcning 2002b). Even Pufendorf\u2019s concretely situated\nand apparently partisan defenses of the Swedish interest (Discussio,\nOccas.) \u2013 which were sometimes regarded as merely contingent or\nopportunistic productions \u2013 exhibit the challenge (for\nparticular sovereigns and their historians) of applying the natural\nlaw\u2019s general injunctions to specific historical circumstances.\nMost obviously, perhaps, his explicitly historical works \u2013\nincluding the long accounts of Sweden (Gust. Ad., C. Gust.) and of\nBrandenburg (Fr. Wilh., Pufendorf 1784) that so distinguished him, but\nalso his famous Introductions (Einl. 1682, 1686b) \u2013\ngive substance to and thus support his philosophical analysis of the\nstate (Seidler 1996 and 1997, Piirim\u00e4e 2008, Dufour 1991c,\nKrawczuk 2014). To be sure, the focus here is mainly on the external\nrelations and negotiations of particular states. But sovereigns must\nconduct these as judiciously and effectively as their states\u2019\ninternal affairs, for it is useless to have internal peace if a state\nis externally weak (DJN VII.4.5). The two dimensions of statecraft are\nclearly linked throughout Pufendorf\u2019s opus, which urges\nsovereigns (and those who create them) to consult both long- and\nshort-term interests of states, distinguishing the real from the\nmerely apparent ones (Einl., Preface, 2013), both to avoid the\n(re)emergence of an internal or external state of nature and, more\ngenerally, to satisfy the natural law\u2019s injunction to further\nsociality among humans.\n",
