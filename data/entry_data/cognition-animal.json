    "preamble": "\n\nPhilosophical attention to animals can be found in a wide range of\ntexts throughout the history of philosophy, including discussions of\nanimal classification in Aristotle and Ibn B\u00e2jja, of animal\nrationality in Porphyry, Chrysippus, Aquinas and Kant, of mental\ncontinuity and the nature of the mental in Dharmak\u012brti, Telesio,\nConway, Descartes, Cavendish, and Voltaire, of animal\nself-consciousness in Ibn Sina, of understanding what others think and\nfeel in Zhuangzi, of animal emotion in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nand Bentham, and of human cultural uniqueness in Xunzi. In recent\nyears, there has been increased attention to animal minds in\nphilosophical discussions across many areas of metaphysics,\nepistemology, and value theory. Given that nonhuman animals share some\nbiological and psychological features with humans, and that we share\ncommunity, land, and other resources, consideration of nonhuman\nanimals has much to contribute to our philosophical activities.\n\nContemporary philosophy of animal minds often also engages with the\nsciences of animal cognition and behavior. The science of comparative\ncognition is a thriving area of research, complementing the\nphilosophical study in two ways. For one, philosophers of animal\ncognition can use claims resulting from animal cognition studies as\npremises in philosophical discussions. For example, Jacob Beck (2012)\nrelies on pigeons\u2019 abilities to compare quantities to argue for\nnonconceptual content; Sidney Carls-Diamante (forthcoming) appeals to\noctopus behavior and physiology to defend embodied cognition; Richard\nMoore (2016a) refers to ape gestural communication to rethink the\nrequirements for intentional communication; Andrew Barron and Colin\nKlein (2016) appeal to insect cognition research to defend new\ntheories of consciousness; Sarah Vincent, Rebecca Ring, and Kristin\nAndrews (2019) cite dolphins\u2019 social practices to argue for the\nexistence of norms that do not require metacognition.\n\nIn addition, philosophers of animal cognition can examine the\nepistemology and methods used to justify the claims that arise from\nthe science. Research into animal cognition has resulted in surprising\nclaims about animal capacities, such as sociality in garter snakes\n(Skinner & Miller 2020), tool-use in ants (Ma\u00e1k et al.\n2017), mirror self-recognition in fish (Kohda et al. 2019), empathy in\nrats (Bartal et al. 2011), social learning in fruit flies (Danchin et\nal. 2018), episodic memory in dogs (Fugazza et al. 2020), addition and\nsubtraction in bees (Howard et al. 2019). How should we evaluate such\nclaims?\n\nSome philosophers have argued that animal cognition research is held\nto a higher standard than human cognition research, and that\nscientists working with animals are sometimes asked to solve skeptical\nproblems (Halina 2015). Others have challenged scientific assumptions\nabout the relationship between brain size and intelligence, as well as\nbiases against invertebrates (Mikhalevich & Powell 2020).\n\nAnimal cognition research challenges philosophers to consider that\nmany capacities and behaviors often assumed to require language,\nsophisticated technological capacities, or legal systems may in fact\nbe had by other animals who lack these properties. In this way, animal\ncognition research often surprises us by showing that\nsophisticated-looking activity can be caused through rather simple\nmechanisms.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. What is Animal Cognition?\n\nCognition is often understood to be what permits flexible\ngoal-oriented behavior through information processing. Comparative\ncognition research examines which animal behaviors are cognitive, and\nwhat sort of cognitive mechanisms or processes permit that behavior.\nQuestions include: What sort of representations do animals need to\nsolve particular tasks; do they have mental maps, metacognition, or\nnumber concepts? How do animals learn; do they only have associative\nlearning processes, or do they also learn through trial-and-error,\nplay, insight, or social imitation? How do animals solve problems; do\nthey engage in logical reasoning, causal reasoning, future planning?\nPhilosophers take up these questions, and complement them with\nquestions of their own, such as: Do animals have beliefs? Which\nanimals are conscious? What is the relationship between language and\nthought? Are animals rational? Answering any of these questions\nrequires both scientific investigation into the phenomenon and\nconceptual analysis of the psychological property at stake. The\nphilosophy of animal minds promises to help us gain a deeper\nunderstanding of familiar concepts by exploring them in a new and\nsometimes foreign context\u2014in the lives and communities of other\nspecies.\n\nVideos of animals engaged in surprising behaviors, such as an\norangutan washing clothes and sawing wood or a dog using buttons to\n\u201cspeak\u201d (see\n Other Internet Resources),\n might suggest that these animals are smart or intelligent. The idea\nthat some animals are smarter than others might also lead you to\nexpect that research in animal cognition focuses on animals such as\nchimpanzees, elephants, dolphins, dogs, or ravens\u2014all species\nthat often make the news with reports of their amazing abilities. But\nanimal cognition research is just as interested in research on worms,\nhoneybees, snakes, stickleback fish, chickadees, and spiders, though\nthere remains quite a bit of cognition research on the behaviorist\nstandbys of pigeons and rats.\n\nFurthermore, animal cognition research tends to eschew questions of\nwhich animals are smarter than others, focusing instead on more\nspecific questions like the ones above. Scientists often say that they\nare more interested in how well an animal evolved to thrive in their\nenvironment, rather than in how smart they are. This way of thinking\nabout intelligence makes comparing intelligence between species moot\n(though it is a topic that is largely unexplored by philosophers of\nanimal minds).\n\nContemporary research in animal cognition has as its roots Charles\nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection, and\nDarwin\u2019s thesis of the continuity of the mental across\nspecies:\n\n\nthe difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it\nis, certainly is one of degree and not of kind. (Darwin 1874: 126,\nwith a minor variation 1871: 105)\n\n\nIn On the Origin of Species (1859), he avoided comparing\nhumans with other animals, as well as foregoing any discussion of the\nevolution of psychological capacities. In his follow up book, The\nDescent of Man (1871 [second edition 1874]), Darwin turned to\ncompare the psychological capacities across species. In introducing\nChapter 3 (chapter 2 in the first edition), he wrote:\n\n\nIf no organic being excepting man had possessed any mental power, or\nif his powers had been of a wholly different nature from those of the\nlower animals, then we should never have been able to convince\nourselves that our high faculties had been gradually developed. But it\ncan be shewn that there is no fundamental difference of this kind. We\nmust also admit that there is a much wider interval in mental power\nbetween one of the lowest fishes, as a lamprey or lancelet, and one of\nthe higher apes, than between an ape and man; yet this interval is\nfilled up by numberless gradations. (Darwin 1874: 65, with a couple of\nminor variations 1871: 34\u201335).\n\n\nDarwin\u2019s talk of higher and lower suggests that some animals are\nless intelligent than others, and that humans, with our advanced\nmental powers, are on top. But that interpretation is in contrast with\nhow comparative psychologists like to think about animals, as\ndifferent rather than as higher or lower. Furthermore, in The\nOrigin Darwin insisted that evolution by natural selection is\nnon-hierarchical\u2014just changes in response to the environment\nrather than a gradual improvement from lower to higher beings.\n\nWhile Darwin is known for his thesis that there is continuity between\nhumans and other animals in their morphological and psychological\nproperties, one might be forgiven for thinking that Darwin was\nsometimes overly hasty in ascribing some human properties to animals.\nIn The Descent, Darwin discusses cases of horses and dogs who\nare ill-tempered and sulky, a baboon and a dog who recognized friendly\npeople after years apart, dreaming canaries, elephants who blow on\nout-of-reach objects to bring them closer, a bear who pawed the water\nto draw in a floating object, a monkey who kept a stone hidden in his\nbedding that he used to crack nuts, and female birds who are attracted\nto male songs and bright colors. Darwin takes these cases to suggest\nanimal emotion, memory, imagination, reason, property, and aesthetic\nsensibility.\n\nThe theory of evolution by natural selection suggests that there will\nbe differences as well as similarities across species. Just as\nDarwin\u2019s finches have different beak shapes depending on the\nfood available on their island, psychological difference should be\nexpected given different environmental pressures. Thus, a Darwinian\napproach to animal cognition will emphasize differences as well as\nsimilarities. Problems arise when the focus is only on questions about\nsimilarities without also attending to questions about differences,\nand vice versa, as we will see in\n section 2.\n\nWhile Darwin may be seen as the progenitor of modern animal cognition\nresearch, many other scientists have played a role, leading to the\nvibrant interdisciplinary research we see today. Learning theorists\nwho look carefully at the mechanisms that lead to acquiring new\nknowledge arose from the behaviorist methods of John Watson and B.F.\nSkinner. Field researchers owe much to the classical ethologists\nNikolaas Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz, and Karl von Frisch. Considerations\nof animal culture found their own progenitor in the work of ecologist\nand anthropologist Kinji Imanishi, who saw social transmission in\nanimals as the same process that supports human cultural learning. The\nidea of creating puzzles for animals to solve can be traced back to\npsychologist Edward Thorndike\u2019s puzzle boxes for cats. The\nrejuvenation of interest in animal consciousness finds an early\ndefense in psychologist Margaret Floy Washburn, whose textbook The\nAnimal Mind: A Text-book of Comparative Psychology (1908) was\nwidely used in psychology for the first third of the twentieth\ncentury. The interface between psychology, anthropology, and biology\nis where most of the research in animal cognition can be found\ntoday.\n\nComparative cognition is the scientific study of animal cognitive\ncapacities that recognizes humans as animals and acknowledges that all\nanimals are evolved biological organisms. It also recognizes that\nthere are species-specific capacities as well as individual\ndifferences, and that these capacities are a part of the natural world\nthat can be studied using familiar scientific methods. Animal\ncognition focuses on capacities and psychological states that are\ncausally effective in behavior, and thus the study of animal cognition\ncan be understood broadly to include all topics that philosophers\ncover under the notion of mind.\n\nFor some, the current philosophical interest in comparative cognition\nwas inspired by series of books written by zoologist Donald Griffin\narguing for animal thinking and animal consciousness (Griffin 1976\n[1981], 1985, 1992 [2001]), topics that were not at the time taken up\nby scientists. Collaborations between scientists and philosophers\nprovided a rich environment for initial work on these issues. Notably,\nin philosopher Colin Allen and biologist Marc Bekoff\u2019s book\nSpecies of Mind: The Philosophy and Biology of Cognitive\nEthology (1997), the interdisciplinary team introduced many\nissues arising in the science of animal minds to the broader\nphilosophical community.\n\nPhilosophers of animal minds are sometimes interested in epistemic\nvirtues related to how the claims of the science are generated and\njustified, and whether the concepts being used in scientific studies\nare reasonable. Philosophers of animal minds are also sometimes\ninterested in how the findings of scientific studies can serve as\npremises in philosophical arguments. In the remainder of this entry we\nwill explore both of these aspects.\n2. Philosophical Assumptions in the Study of Animal Cognition\n\nOne of the ways in which philosophy connects to the study of animal\ncognition has to do with the fact that, as with any science, there are\nnumerous philosophical assumptions embedded in the practice of\ncomparative cognition research. Scientists, like all humans, make\nchoices about how to use terms, they are swayed to formulate questions\nand seek data given the values they have, they have assumptions about\nthe topics under study, as well as views about what makes for a\nscientifically respectable interpretation of data and the virtues of a\ngood scientific explanation. Scientists have the goal of seeking\nobjectivity, but seeking objectivity can itself introduce new biases,\nas we know from work in the philosophy of science on objectivity and\nfeminist philosophy of science. This is as true in animal cognition\nresearch as in any other science (Andrews 2020c).\n\nPhilosophical assumptions in animal cognition research are present,\nmost obviously, in how the capacities under study are defined. For\ninstance, when scientists embark on an experimental project to\ndetermine whether a certain species has capacities such as altruism,\ncooperation, or empathy, they assume a certain definition of these\nterms. These definitions are often operational, meaning that they\nfocus on the behavioral or physiological reactions that one would have\nto see in an animal to confirm that they possess this capacity. But\neven operational definitions come with philosophical baggage. For\ninstance, some scientists consider that finding emotional contagion in\nan animal is enough to claim that that species is capable of empathy.\nThis presupposes that a particular philosophical account of empathy is\ntrue, and not others. Some phenomenological accounts of empathy, for\ninstance, do not require emotional state-matching (Zahavi &\nOvergaard 2012), and so, under these accounts, finding emotional\ncontagion in an animal would not suffice to claim that they are\ncapable of empathy.\n\nSimply stating how one uses a particular term might seem to be good\nscience, for this is thought to offer clarity regarding what exactly\nis being studied. Terms are often defined without any argumentation,\nor simply by reproducing the definition given by another scientist or\none that is generally accepted in a certain scientific tradition.\nHowever, different definitions come with different assumptions and\nimplications. They can establish which animals we study in search for\na certain capacity, the methods we use to study it, and what counts as\nevidence for that capacity. Moreover, determining that an animal has\nthis or that capacity can have profound ethical implications, so how\nwe choose to use our terms is far from normatively neutral.\n\nThis discussion of how terms are used in science is a starting point\nfor understanding the theory-ladenness and value-ladenness of science.\nConsiderations from the philosophy of science can help to bring to\nlight how the choices scientists make impact the research. We will\nnext consider how value-ladenness, theory-ladenness, concerns about\nobjectivity, and appeals to the virtue of simplicity impact\ncomparative cognition research.\n2.1 Theory-ladenness\n\nObservations and definitions of terms can be theory-laden, in that\nthey depend on a set of theoretical assumptions for their\ninterpretation. Theory plays a role in background assumptions in\nanimal cognition about the continuity or discontinuity of the mental\nacross species, or regarding the relationship between certain\nbehaviors and certain capacities, or how best to get good results from\nresearch subjects.\n\nFor example, Darwin\u2019s perception of psychological continuity\nbetween species is an example of a theory-laden commitment that shapes\nhow the data is perceived. Among today\u2019s scientists, there is a\ndiversity of views about continuity and discontinuity. Some scientists\nmay be described as \u201cromantic\u201d because they take animals\nand humans to share many psychological properties the way Darwin\ndescribed it. Other scientists may be described as\n\u201ckilljoy\u201d because they deny many human capacities to\nanimals. This terminology, first used by Daniel Dennett (1983), and\ncriticized by Sara Shettleworth (2010b), highlights an example of a\ntheory-laden approach to science. Attempts to avoid working from one\nof these two perspectives are attempts to find objectivity, which as\nwe will see admits of its own challenges.\n\nAnimal cognition research can also be theory-laden within particular\nresearch paradigms. We can look at two current examples. The\ndecades-long use of the false belief task as a measure for theory of\nmind in children and animals can be traced back to three commentaries\non a scientific study of theory of mind (Premack & Woodruff 1978)\nby philosophers Dennett (1978), Jonathan Bennett (1978), and Gilbert\nHarman (1978), who first suggested this methodology. The suggestion\nreflected current philosophical theorizing associated with\nfunctionalism in the philosophy of mind, and a theory of action\naccording to which behaviors are caused by propositional\nattitudes\u2014beliefs and desires.\n\nAnother example is seen in research on social learning and imitation\nin nonhuman great apes that is grounded in the theory that the\nsignificant difference between humans and other animals rests on the\ncumulative nature of human culture (e.g., Dennett 2017; Henrich 2016;\nHeyes 2018; Sterelny 2012; Tomasello 2016). According to this theory,\nhumans learn cultural behavior by a process of high-fidelity imitation\nin which even causally irrelevant aspects of the behavior are\ncopied\u2014overimitation\u2014and subsequent generations innovate\nimprovements that lead to an ever-growing technological society.\nOverimitation is understood here to be a capacity towards which humans\nare strongly drawn and that is thought to be driven by social factors,\nsuch as a desire to \u201cfit in\u201d. Great apes have been tested\nfor overimitation several times and scientists have failed to find\nrobust evidence that they overimitate (though, complicating this\nstory, there is evidence that chimpanzees sometimes overimitate those\nwith whom they have a long-term relationship (Myowa-Yamakoshi &\nMatsuzawa 2000) and that domestic dogs sometimes overimitate their\nhuman companion (Huber et al. 2018; Huber et al. 2020)). In contrast,\nyoung children will readily overimitate the actions of selective\nexperimenters (Clay & Tennie 2018). Scientists have described this\npattern of results as a \u201cfailure\u201d on behalf of the apes\nand a \u201csuccess\u201d on behalf of the children, and are taken\nto bolster the claim that apes lack cumulative culture given theories\nof cultural learning.\n2.2 Value-ladenness\n\nPhilosophers of science have highlighted that scientific studies are\nalso value-laden, insofar as scientists\u2019 values shape how they\ndo their science and the data that it ultimately delivers. This is\nalso evident in the study of animal cognition. Values shape the choice\nof capacities to study. For example, during the twentieth century, a\ngreat deal of effort went into attempting to teach various forms of\nlinguistic communication to great apes, an endeavor that stems from\nthe value that humans place on language. Values also shape the methods\nthat scientists use. Experimental evidence coming from labs is often\nconsidered more valuable than observational evidence coming from field\nstudies, because the increase in ability to control the different\nvariables that can affect an animal\u2019s performance is thought to\ncompensate for the loss of ecological validity that comes with the\nhighly artificial experimental settings. Values also shape how\nscientists interpret the results of their studies. The data that an\nempirical study delivers is useless without an interpretation, and\nthis interpretation cannot be fully disentangled from the values\nupheld by scientists. This is because scientists have to choose which\nstatistical methods to apply, which theories to accept, and what\nnarrative they follow when writing up the results in a scientific\npaper.\n\nThe research on animal culture is another example of value-ladenness,\ngiven that the driving force behind it is a fascination with human\nculture, and an attempt to map out the cognitive differences between\nour own and the other ape species that can explain the origins of our\nuniqueness. This is why the negative results in experiments that have\ntested for great ape overimitation are described as a\n\u201cfailure\u201d on their behalf. However, by its very definition\noverimitation is the imitation of actions that are irrelevant to\nproducing the desired goal, so one could easily turn these results on\ntheir head and describe this as evidence that apes will go for the\nmore efficient solution to the problem, which children fail to do. The\nfact that these results are not described this way evidences a\nvalue-laden perspective, from which overimitation is seen as a\n\u201cdesirable\u201d capacity, insofar as it is linked to other\ncharacteristically human traits, such as rituals, normativity, and\ncumulative technologies.\n\nAnother good example of how the design of studies in comparative\ncognition is value-laden is the mirror self-recognition (MSR) test,\nwhich was originally envisioned by Gordon Gallup (1970) to probe\nanimals\u2019 self-awareness. In this test, an animal is first\nallowed to become familiarized with a mirror. In a second step, the\nanimal is anesthetized and an odorless mark is painted on their\nforehead. The behavior of the animal in front of the mirror is then\nobserved, to see whether they interact with the mark, which would be a\nsign that they understand that the individual in the mirror is\nthemself. Passing the MSR test is viewed as a sign of self-awareness,\nthough whether it shows awareness of one\u2019s own mind or just\none\u2019s body is disputed (Heyes 1994, 2008; Povinelli 1998).\nLeaving aside whether the MSR test actually addresses this capacity,\nwhich is an issue of theory-ladenness, we would like to draw attention\nto the methodology itself. As has long been argued, animals can fail\nthis test for reasons that have nothing to do with their lack of\nself-awareness. For instance, gorillas\u2019 failure to pass the test\nhas been linked to the fact that this species tends to avoid eye\ncontact with conspecifics, because it is considered a threat\n(Shillito, Gallup, & Beck 1999). Other species might fail the test\nbecause vision is not their primary sensory modality. Dogs, for\ninstance, fail the MSR test but pass an analogous olfactory test\n(Horowitz 2017). In this alternative, dogs are presented with urine\nsamples from themselves and other dogs. Results show that they spend\nless time sniffing their own urine marks, which evidences some form of\nolfactory self-recognition. For humans, however, vision is the primary\nand most cherished sensory modality and this often leads to study\ndesigns that, like the MSR test, are vision-centered. Joint attention,\nfor instance, is measured by means of gaze-following (Carpenter &\nCall 2013), which Maria Botero (2016) has criticized, arguing that for\nnonhuman primates touch might also be a medium for joint attention to\nemerge.\n\nDespite these problems, the MSR test is still treated as the gold\nstandard in the study of self-awareness, which illustrates the value\nthat humans place on visual self-recognition, and our failure to\nappreciate that other animals may recognize themselves through other\nsensory modalities. Additionally, the MSR test presupposes that the\nanimals tested care in some sense about their appearance.\nThis is a necessary requirement for them to be motivated to interact\nwith the mark. The fact that this is taken for granted in discussions\non the MSR test illustrates the importance that we grant to\nmirrors delivering our expected self-reflection. However, it is not\nimmediately obvious that all animals should care about this. Instead,\nwhether or not they do will likely be shaped by their particular\necology and evolutionary history. For example, a tiny fish, the\ncleaner wrasse, has been recently shown to pass the MSR test,\nattempting to scrape off the mark in the presence of a mirror and\nignoring it if it was colorless or there was no mirror available\n(Kohda et al. 2019). This initially surprising result becomes less so\nwhen one considers that this species of fish feeds off the parasites\nthat they visually detect on the skin of other fish, and the mark that\nwas planted on their head was intentionally made to mimic the color,\nsize, and shape of one of these parasites. In the cleaner\nwrasse\u2019s Umwelt, this mark is clearly something worth\nattending to, but it might not be the case for all species. Other\nanimals, for instance, might care much more if their coat smells in an\nunexpected way than if there is some debris on their head.\n\nFurther exemplifying value-ladenness, it is not uncommon for\nexperimental results in comparative psychology to be communicated in a\nway that depicts the human species as \u201csuperior,\u201d which\ncan be illustrated by some experiments that have compared chimpanzee\nperformance to our own. Daniel Povinelli and colleagues (1999), for\nexample, found that chimpanzees outperform children in a\ngaze-following task, but interpreted the children\u2019s poorer\nperformance as evidence of their possession of superior cognitive\ncapacities (see also Leavens, Bard, & Hopkins 2017). In this\nexperiment, the subjects had to follow the experimenter\u2019s gaze\nto find a reward, which both children and chimpanzees could do. In one\ncondition, however, the experimenter was oriented towards the reward\nbut gazing above it. While the chimpanzees could still use this gaze\nto find the reward, the children chose randomly in these trials.\nPovinelli et al. interpreted this as evidence that children, but not\nchimpanzees, have a theory of mind, which allowed the children to\ninterpret the above-target gaze as a distracted one that was not worth\nfollowing. From the chimpanzees\u2019 perspective, however, one could\nalso argue for their superiority in this task, since they were much\nmore successful than the children in actually finding the reward. In\nanother experiment (Jensen, Call, & Tomasello 2007), chimpanzees\nwere tested in an ultimatum game, where one chimpanzee (the proposer)\ncould choose how a reward was distributed among themself and another\nchimpanzee (the responder). The responder could either choose to\naccept the offer (in which case, they both kept it) or reject it\n(which would have meant they both lost it). The experimenters found\nthat the responder would always accept the offer, regardless of how\nunfair the distribution was, so long as their part was higher than\nzero. Chimpanzees behaved in the way that economic theory predicts of\nthe fully rational agent, in contrast to humans, who would typically\nrather be left with zero than accept an unfair distribution. Although\nthe researchers acknowledge this, they also make a point of\nhighlighting how these results illustrate that chimpanzees lack the\nsensitivity to fairness that characterizes (superior) human societies,\nthough they fail to consider that chimpanzees may have fairness norms\nin domains outside of food sharing. A further example of results being\ninterpreted to fit the narrative of human superiority comes from a\nstudy by Sana Inoue and Tetsuro Matsuzawa (2007), where a chimpanzee\nnamed Ayumu was found to strongly outperform humans in terms of speed\nand accuracy in a working memory task. Although in this paper the\nsuperiority of the chimp was acknowledged without caveats, one of the\nauthors (Matsuzawa 2010) later used these results to highlight the\nsuperior cognitive capacities of humans, arguing for the existence of\na trade-off between memory and abstraction in the phylogeny and\nontogeny of our species, such that by letting go of the photographic\nmemory that our ancestors likely shared with chimpanzees, we could\ndevelop our characteristic skills for complex representation and\nlanguage.\n2.3 Objectivity\n\nWhile one might hope that an appeal to objectivity would help to\noffset the theory-ladenness and value-ladenness of science,\nphilosophers of science tend to describe objectivity as an ideal,\nrather than an achievable result, of good science. Given that\nobjectivity can be understood as a commitment to value- and\ntheory-free faithfulness to facts that avoid any personal bias or\nperspective\u2014a view from nowhere\u2014it is at best a guide to\nbalancing biases rather than avoiding them.\n\nAnimal cognition research has a particular interest in being\nobjective, for some of the reasons reviewed in the previous two\nsections. Furthermore, as we saw in\n section 1,\n Darwin may have emphasized similarities over differences between\nspecies, suggesting a bias toward seeing other animals as like us. If\nhumans are biased towards seeing animals as too much like humans, then\nsome principles to protect against that bias may be needed. We see\nthis in two classic principles used in comparative psychology:\nMorgan\u2019s Canon and a prohibition against anthropomorphism.\n\nThe British biologist and psychologist C. Lloyd Morgan was worried\nthat the methods of Darwin emphasized our tendencies to see others as\nlike us, and he felt the need to offer a corrective to our egocentric\nbiases in the form of what is now called Morgan\u2019s Canon:\n\n\nIn no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise\nof a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome\nof the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale.\n(Morgan 1894: 53)\n\n\nMorgan describes his Canon by telling us the story of Tony, a\nfox-terrier pup who was able to open the gate from his garden and\nescape into the road by putting his head under the latch of the gate,\nlifting the latch and waiting for the gate to swing open. While it\nmight look like Tony was smart\u2014that he had a goal and knew how\nto achieve it by lifting the latch, Morgan invites us to consider\nother explanations. Perhaps Tony saw that the latch was liftable, and\nlifted it, without knowing the gate would open or wanting to get out.\nPerhaps Tony had associated the latch with getting out to the street,\nand wanted to get to the street, so he pushed against the latch\nwithout knowing how it worked. The worry is that, by thinking that\nTony was a clever little dog, an observer is being\nanthropomorphic.\n\nThough in its strictly literal sense, \u201canthropomorphism\u201d\nsimply makes reference to the attribution of human-like\ncharacteristics to animals, in its common usage in comparative\ncognition it has a very negative connotation, such that it is used to\nmake reference to the mistaken attribution of human-like\ncharacteristics to animals. Thus understood, anthropomorphism is\nconnected to humans\u2019 well-documented tendency to over-attribute\nmental states. This was already demonstrated in the 1940s, in a famous\nstudy by Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel (1944). In this study, human\nparticipants were shown a video that depicted animated geometric\nshapes moving around the screen (see Heider and Simmel (1944)\nanimation in\n Other Internet Resources\n for the video). Although the shapes make no sounds and have no facial\nexpressions, the participants couldn\u2019t help but interpret their\nmovement in intentional terms and construct a narrative regarding\ntheir \u201cinteractions\u201d. This is a particularly egregious\nexample of our anthropomorphic biases, which lead us to be inclined to\ninterpret the behavior of entities (human, non-human, and beyond) in\nhuman-like terms. Scientists studying animal cognition are well aware\nof this problematic tendency, and they attempt to counter it by\nstressing the importance of avoiding anthropomorphism.\n\nHowever, the dictum regarding the need to avoid anthropomorphism is\nalso a philosophical assumption embedded in comparative cognition and,\nas such, it can be questioned. It has been argued, for instance, that\na blanket ban against the attribution of human-like qualities to\nanimals would beg the question by assuming that said qualities are\nindeed uniquely human (Fitzpatrick 2017a). Frans de Waal (1999) uses\nthe term \u201canthropodenial\u201d to refer to the a priori\nrejection of the possibility that humans and animals may share\ncharacteristics, and argues that it is just as worrisome as\nanthropomorphism. He points out that there is an imbalance in\ncomparative cognition, such that the over-attribution of mental\ncapacities to animals is seen as much more problematic than the\nunder-attribution. The reason behind this is that comparative\npsychologists are wary of violating Morgan\u2019s Canon. However, by\nlooking to preserve cognitive parsimony at all costs, de Waal\nargues, comparative psychologists may be disregarding\nevolutionary parsimony, which dictates that we should offer\nexplanations that posit the fewest possible changes in the\nphylogenetic tree. We should thus steer clear of both anthropodenial\nand anthropomorphism. A similar point was made by Kristin Andrews and\nBrian Huss (2014), who coined the term \u201canthropectomy\u201d to\nrefer to the mistake of denying that an animal has a certain\ncharacteristically human capacity when in fact they do have that\ncapacity. They argue that anthropomorphism and anthropectomy are both\nerrors, they both amount to a false depiction of how the world\nactually is, and so there is no reason to fear one over the other.\n\nWhile anti-anthropomorphism attempts to avoid the bias of seeing mind\nwhen it isn\u2019t there, it risks placing emphasis on another bias\nthat humans are subject to, namely the bias of human exceptionalism.\nAnthropectomy arises in cases in which humans see their own cognitive\ncapacities as sophisticated, and other species as only having diluted\nversions of them. For example, it is anthropectic to observe human\ncultural practices and infer that because other species don\u2019t\nhave opera houses they don\u2019t have culture. When we make\nself-serving bias errors and assume too quickly that we are better\nthan other people, we get ourselves and other people wrong.\nAnthropectic thinking extends this bias toward other animals.\n\nMorgan also warned scientists against anthropectomy. In what we can\ncall Morgan\u2019s Challenge, he warned us not to too quickly ascribe\nsophisticated capacities as explanations of human behavior:\n\n\nTo interpret animal behavior one must learn also to see one\u2019s\nown mentality at levels of development much lower than one\u2019s\ntop-level of reflective self-consciousness. It is not easy, and savors\nsomewhat of paradox. (Morgan 1932: 250)\n\n\nMorgan\u2019s idea that we have to avoid exaggerating human\ncapacities and wrongly denying that we share capacities with other\nanimals has been taken up in current discussions of philosophers and\npsychologists. For example, as Shettleworth (2010b) points out, much\nhuman behavior is controlled by simple and often unconscious cognitive\nmechanisms of the sort we usually only associate with animals. We tend\nto disregard this and, as a result, we sometimes engage in\nanthropomorphism towards humans! Not only is there a tendency to\nforget that human behavior is often caused by simple mechanisms, one\ncan also see a propensity to exaggerate the prowess of humans at\nvarious tasks. If we are wrong about human capacities, and then deny a\ncontinuity claim because we fail to find those confabulated capacities\nin other animals, we commit a double error\u2014confabulating human\ncognitive mechanisms plus anthropocentrism, an error Cameron Buckner\ncalls \u201canthropofabulation\u201d (Buckner 2013). For example,\ndespite the fact that we know that human memory is constructive and\nconfabulatory to a large degree, many comparative psychologists engage\nin anthropofabulation by expecting animals to be capable of mentally\nreplaying past events in order to be credited with episodic memory\n(Suddendorf & Corballis 2007; Tulving 1985; cited in Buckner 2013:\n830).\n\nOne way to think of Morgan\u2019s general idea is that to explain\nanimal behavior we need to have a variety of competing hypotheses, and\nfrom that set we can then pick the one that fits best. Morgan\u2019s\nCanon suggests that psychologically lower explanations are best,\nappealing to a kind of simplicity principle associated with\nOckham\u2019s Razor. But what counts as best is a classic problem in\nthe philosophy of science. We turn to this issue next.\n2.4 Simplicity\n\nAnother aspect of the science of animal cognition where philosophical\nassumptions become evident is in the preference given to simpler\nexplanations of animal behavior. Simplicity has long been seen as a\nvirtue of scientific explanations, but it is notoriously difficult to\ndecide what makes one explanation simpler than another.\n\nIn comparative psychology, and especially when following\nMorgan\u2019s Canon, simpler explanations are taken by default as the\nnull hypothesis. This means that they are assumed to be true unless\nproven otherwise, and that the burden of proof falls on the side of\nmore complex explanations. For example, research into causal reasoning\nin animals takes as its null hypothesis animals\u2019 ability to\nlearn associations between different events. The experiments then\nprobe into whether animals are not just capable of this simple form of\nlearning, but whether they have the more complex capacity to\ncomprehend that some events cause others. When the\nexperimental data support both a simple hypothesis and a more complex\none, it is standard among scientists to prefer the simpler\nexplanation. For instance, some have argued that the experiments done\nto test whether animals are capable of metacognition (or thinking\nabout their thoughts) can in fact be passed by reasoning solely in\nfirst-order terms (or thinking about the world). Since first-order\nthinking is assumed to be a simpler explanation of the data, it has\nbeen argued that this explanation ought to be favored (e.g.,\nCarruthers 2003; Hampton 2009).\n\nThe idea that simpler explanations ought to be preferred is viewed by\nmany as self-evident, a result of applying Ockham\u2019s Razor to the\nstudy of animal cognition, and the claim that an explanation is\n\u201csimpler\u201d or \u201cmore parsimonious\u201d is often\noffered as the equivalent to \u201cEnd of discussion!\u201d However,\nin the past couple of decades philosophers have argued that this\npreference for simplicity in comparative cognition is much more\nproblematic than it may initially seem. For one, many have argued that\nthere is no reason why a simpler explanation will be more likely to be\ntrue in this context. Simpler explanations may have other virtues,\nsuch as being easier to understand or to describe, but since animal\nbehavior is the result of natural selection, and not the outcome of a\nprocess of intelligent design that infallibly delivers optimal\nsolutions, there is no reason to think that it is more likely to be\ncaused by simpler processes (Mikhalevich, Powell, & Logan 2017).\nIn fact, some have argued that when scientists claim a preference for\nsimpler explanations, it is actually some other consideration that is\ndoing the epistemic work, like the idea that we should avoid\nanthropomorphic descriptions of animal behavior (Fitzpatrick 2017a;\nSober 1998). We see this, for instance, in Shettleworth\u2019s\n(2010a) equation of simpler explanations with associative ones. She\nargues that associative explanations are to be preferred, but this is\nnot a result of a preference for simplicity per se, but stems from the\nidea that association is phylogenetically widespread in the animal\nkingdom, and so associative explanations are, in her view, more likely\nto be true.\n\nIn fact, there is no such thing as simplicity per se. Instead, what we\nhave are different types of simplicity depending on how and what we\nfocus on \u201csimplifying\u201d. Irina Mikhalevich (2017) has\nargued that simplification can be done through homogenization, by\naiming at fewer entity types; through reduction, by decreasing the\nnumber of entities; or through idealization, by removing entities that\nare not seen as crucial. Simon Fitzpatrick (2009) distinguishes five\ndifferent notions of the ideal of simplicity that are used in the\nliterature on comparative cognition:\n\nsimplicity as psychological unity (preferring explanations that\nunify different behaviors by positing a single cognitive\nmechanism);\nsimplicity as parsimony of mental representations (preferring\nX over Y as an explanation whenever Y entails\nX but not vice versa);\nsimplicity as less cognitive sophistication (preferring\nexplanations that attribute the least cognitively sophisticated\nmechanisms);\nsimplicity as analogy (preferring explanations that posit similar\ncognitive mechanisms to explain similar behavior in different\nspecies);\nsimplicity as evolutionary parsimony (preferring explanations that\nposit mechanisms inherited from a common ancestor to explain similar\nbehavior in different species).\n\n\nMike Dacey (2016) distinguishes further notions of simplicity, such as\na preference for those mechanisms that demand less computational\nmemory, time, or energy, those that require less input data, or those\nthat posit fewer changes in the phylogenetic tree. We previewed an\nargument along these lines in our discussion of anthropomorphism and\nanthropodenial\u2014which is simpler, positing a simpler cognitive\ncapacity and more changes over evolutionary time, or positing a more\nsophisticated cognitive capacity and fewer changes over evolutionary\ntime?\n\nThese different notions of simplicity are not only conceptually\ndistinct, they are often mutually incompatible or conflicting. Nowhere\nhas this become more evident than in the chimpanzee theory of mind\ndebate. The last few years have witnessed a huge controversy over the\nexperimental results in this research area. A number of studies have\nshown that chimpanzees can use information regarding what a competitor\nhas visual access to in order to decide whether or not to go for a\nreward (Hare et al. 2000; Hare, Call, & Tomasello 2001; Karg et\nal. 2015; Melis, Call, & Tomasello 2006). The controversy arose\nbecause these experimental results can in principle be explained by\npositing that chimpanzees were reasoning about the mental states of\nothers (in this case, about what they could or could not see), or that\nthey were solely reasoning about their behavior (e.g., about their\nbodily orientation or the existence of an uninterrupted line of gaze\nbetween their eyes and the reward). What is interesting about this\ncontroversy is that the defenders of each of these options were both\nclaiming to be offering the simplest explanation of the data. For\nMichael Tomasello and Josep Call (2006), it\u2019s more parsimonious\nto assume that chimpanzees can understand what others can and cannot\nsee rather than posit that they have learned a different behavioral\nrule for every relevant situation that involves a competitor\u2019s\nline of gaze. For Povinelli and Jennifer Vonk (2004), mental state\nattributions can only be inferred from another\u2019s behavior, which\nmeans that every mindreader must also be a behavior reader. Since the\nopposite is not the case, it\u2019s more parsimonious to assume that\nchimpanzees are behavior readers rather than mindreaders. The\nchimpanzee theory of mind controversy perfectly illustrates that the\nissue of simplicity is a philosophical one, meaning that the question\nof whether, to what extent, and in what sense simpler explanations\nought to be preferred is one that cannot be settled solely through\nempirical measurements or mathematical calculations, but requires\nphilosophical analysis and argumentation (for discussions, see\nClatterbuck 2017, 2018; Sober 2015).\n2.5 Summary\n\nObjectivity and simplicity are taken as goals of science, which is\nunderstood to aim at tracking the facts of the world. The\nvalue-ladenness and theory-ladenness of science, however, shows how\ndifficult it is to achieve those goals. While this is true of science\nin general, with animal cognition the stakes are different. Human use\nof animals in food, in medicine, in work, as entertainment, and as\ncompanions raises a host of sometimes conflicting goals that scaffold\nmotivated reasoning and risk implicit bias. The quest for truth about\nanimal capacities relates to an over-arching philosophical theme in\ncomparative cognition: the human-animal divide and the question of the\nextent and areas of continuity between the minds of humans and other\nanimals. This is not a normatively-neutral issue, but rather, the\npicture that science delivers of the human-animal divide can serve to\njustify or undermine the practices that constitute the human-animal\nrelationship. As we will see in\n section 3,\n addressing the biases and philosophical assumptions that shape the\nscience of animal cognition is of great importance for getting things\nright philosophically as well as ethically.\n3. Animal Cognition Applied to Philosophy\n\nThe science of animal behavior and cognition is increasingly being\nused to provide premises in philosophical arguments. What follows is\nan extremely brief gesture toward several areas of philosophy that\nhave benefited from recent attention to the sciences of animal mind\nand behavior.\n\nBefore we begin, we should point out two potential obstacles with this\nproject. It\u2019s important to note that the use of animal cognition\nresearch in philosophy must be handled carefully, given the\nmethodological considerations discussed in\n section 2.\n Sometimes philosophers seek to show that animals have a property\nbecause they have a capacity, but the way the capacity was\noperationalized in the study is different from how the philosopher\nunderstands it. While many of the terms used in comparative cognition\nare familiar, they may be defined differently, which can lead to\nconfusion and misunderstanding.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that the relationship between a\ntheory and a claim about an animal having or lacking a psychological\nproperty is a tight one. Sometimes philosophers are both arguing for a\ntheory and for a claim that an animal has a particular property; such\nprojects might be defended as cohesive, or they might be critiqued as\nquestion-begging.\n\nKeeping these obstacles in mind, in this section, we will have a look\nat how the evidence coming from the science has influenced and shaped\ndifferent philosophical debates.\n3.1 The problem of other minds\n\nThe traditional philosophical problem of other minds, which challenges\nus to consider the evidential basis for our commitment that other\nhumans are minded beings like ourselves, exists in an extreme form\nwhen applied to other animals (see Andrews 2020b: Chapter 1).\n\nThe traditional argument from analogy for other minds rests on\nsimilarities between oneself and other humans. While the traditional\nargument is weak enough, when the analogy goes from humans to members\nof another species, it becomes significantly weaker.\n\nThe argument from analogy for animal minds can be formulated\nas:\n\nHumans who have minds have some property M.\nIndividuals of species A have property M.\nTherefore, individuals of species A probably have\nminds.\n\n\nBut what is M? Commonly used properties in such arguments\ninclude observable behaviors (such as emotional or communicative\nbehavior), passing certain experimental tests (such as success on a\nmemory task or a reasoning task), or physical structures (such as the\nexistence of a neocortex).\n\nThe inference to the best explanation argument for animal\nminds rests on the claim that the existence of animal minds is a\nbetter explanation of animal behavior and physiology than those\noffered by other hypotheses. This argument can be formulated as:\n\nIndividuals of species x engage in behaviors y.\nThe best scientific explanation for an individual engaging in\nbehaviors y is that they have a mind.\nTherefore, it is likely that individuals of species x have\nminds.\n\n\nWhen we look for the best explanation for a phenomenon, we first have\nto generate a number of hypotheses, and then decide between them. The\nbest explanation will be the one that can be used to generate accurate\npredictions and that coheres with our other scientific\ncommitments.\n\nThe argument from evolutionary parsimony is based on the idea\nthat closely related species share some physical traits, and this\nrelationship can offer evidence in favor of a mentalistic causal\nexplanation in certain cases. For example, we can consider this\nargument that chimpanzees have minds:\n\nThe more parsimonious explanation requires the fewest changes\nbetween species with recent common ancestors.\nHumans and chimpanzees have a recent common ancestor.\nHumans achieve behavior B by psychological capacity\nP.\nTherefore, it is most parsimonious to infer that chimpanzees\nachieve behavior B by psychological capacity P.\n\n\nIn his discussion of this style of argument, Elliott Sober (2015)\npoints out that phylogenetic parsimony only offers some evidence of\nthe trait in other animals; while the probability of chimpanzees\nhaving P is raised by the presence of P in humans, given\nother considerations we might still conclude that the probability of\nchimpanzees having P is low.\n\nThese arguments all have their weakness when it comes to their ability\nto justify belief in other animal minds, just as the humancentric\nversions do when it comes to other human minds. Even when used in\nconjunction with one another, there is room for doubt when it comes to\nother minds. However, in the case of humans, it is deemed a mental\nillness to worry that the others around you are actually minded. The\nweakness of these arguments suggests that when we are doing science\nand trying to determine the causes of behavior, we are engaged in one\nproject, but when we are considering the traditional problem of other\nminds when it comes to other animals, we are engaged in a different\nkind of project, one of relating to others.\n\nDale Jamieson (1998) argues that the problem of other minds is solved\nnot inferentially, but via engagement with other beings. The\ninferential solution to the problem suggests that when we see other\nbeings we see behaving bodies rather than agents or\npeople\u2014individuals we can have relationships with. Jamieson\nsuggests that this idea of a behaving body is a \u201cphilosophical\nmonster\u201d\u2014a boogie man created by philosophers that creates\na problem rather than solving one.\n\nWhen philosophers presume humans have minds, rather than feel that\nthey have to prove their existence, they can move forward to ask\nquestions about those minds. The same goes for other species.\nSkepticism about the existence of other minds remains a possibility in\nthe human as well as the nonhuman case.\n3.2 The mind-body problem\n\nThe traditional mind-body problem asks what are the relationships that\nexist between mental properties and physical properties, or between\nthe mental and the physical. Appealing to nonhuman animals offers\nadditional evidence in support of theories regarding the relationship\nbetween the mind and the body.\n\nFor example, Hilary Putnam (1967) famously used the example of octopus\npain to challenge identity theory and introduce the notion of multiple\nrealizability into the philosophy of mind. While Putnam presumed the\nexistence of pain in the octopus, contemporary philosophers use the\nscience of octopus behavior and physiology to argue for embodied\ncognition (Carls-Diamante forthcoming) or to suggest the existence of\nmultiple cognitive systems working together in a single organism\n(Godfrey-Smith 2016).\n\nResearch on animals without neurons, such as sponges, or on other\norganisms, such as slime molds, which show habituation learning\n(Boisseau, Vogel, & Dussutour 2016), or pea plants, which show\nassociative learning (Gagliano et al. 2016; though for a dissenting\nview see Markel 2020), also offers opportunities for supporting the\nmultiple realizability of the material and organization that supports\ncognition and mentality.\n3.3 Consciousness\n\nPhilosophers are developing theories of consciousness that are\nsensitive to studies of neurobiological and psychological properties\nof animals, including pain, emotions, decision-making, learning,\nmemory, and future planning. Philosophers are also using theories of\nconsciousness to argue for or against animal consciousness. For\nexample, in his book Human and Animal Minds: The Consciousness\nQuestions Laid to Rest (2019), Peter Carruthers argues that since\nconsciousness is neural processing in a human global workspace, and\nnonhuman animals lack the equivalent to a human global workspace, it\ndoesn\u2019t make sense to continue asking whether animals are\nconscious. In contrast, Michael Tye (1997) argues that on his PANIC\ntheory of consciousness most vertebrates and invertebrates will be\nconscious, because they have to evaluate their sense data in order to\nact. Such theory-first approaches often end in a standoff between\ntheories.\n\nSome philosophers and scientists also argue from a more\npre-theoretical position that many species are conscious. In their\nplea for a new science of consciousness, Francis Crick and Christof\nKoch (1990) decided to assume that some mammals are conscious in order\nto study consciousness in animals, which might explain the widespread\nuse of macaque monkeys as research subjects in consciousness studies.\nAndrews (2020c) argues that presuming animal consciousness in this way\nhas a precedent in human sciences; while we can\u2019t prove\nthat humans are conscious, we are justified in presuming\nhumans are conscious, just as we are justified in presuming that there\nis an external world, and that we\u2019re not merely brains in vats.\nThe premise that humans are conscious allows us to do good science,\nand generates findings that are robustly predictive and support other\nfacts that we believe are true. If the premise that animals are\nconscious also supports the fecundity of science, it should be taken\nas starting point.\n\nA common theory-light approach deals with markers for consciousness. A\nmarker is an indicator of something we cannot directly perceive, and\nin the case of consciousness we find markers by relying on our own\nphenomenological experience. For example, in his book Personhood,\nEthics, and Animal Cognition (2012), Gary Varner relies on\nbehavior and physiology of pain in order to argue that nociceptors\nconnected to the brain, endogenous opioids, responsiveness to\nanalgesics, and appropriate pain behavior are sufficient indicators of\nconsciousness. Scientific data current at the time suggested to Varner\nthat all vertebrates experience pain, but among the invertebrates, the\ncurrent science only suggested pain in cephalopods (such as octopus,\nsquid, and cuttlefish). More recently, Tye\u2019s Tense Bees and\nShell-Shocked Crabs: Are Animals Conscious? (2017) suggests we\nuse Newton\u2019s Principle (\u201cfrom similar effects we can infer\nsimilar causes\u201d) and the premise that certain human behaviors\nare caused by consciousness to infer that certain animal behaviors are\ncaused by conscious experience; this approach finds consciousness in\ncrabs, bees, and fish, as well as mammals, birds, and reptiles.\n\nYet another way of finding markers of consciousness is to ask what\nconsciousness is for\u2014the function of consciousness. In their\nbook The Evolution of the Sensitive Soul, Simona Ginsburg and\nEva Jablonka (2019) propose that consciousness evolved with the\ndevelopment of a capacity for an open-ended kind of learning they call\nUnlimited Associative Learning (UAL), originating in the Cambrian era.\nUAL permits organisms to assign value to new and complex stimuli, to\nremember the associations with these stimuli, and to use those\nmemories to make decisions in the future.\n\nThis tension between these different approaches has led philosophers\nto engage in meta-theoretical analysis of how best to answer the\nquestion. Jonathan Birch argues that the debate about invertebrate\nconsciousness can move forward if we adopt a theory-light approach\nover theory-heavy and theory-neutral approaches (Birch forthcoming).\nEric Schwitzgebel (2019) argues that when we rely on a theory of\nconsciousness in order to answer questions about consciousness in\nanimals who are very different from us, such as garden snails, we\ninevitably beg the question, suggesting that any theory-first approach\nto such questions is not going to be helpful. To move forward on\nquestions of consciousness in beings who are very different from the\nmammals, birds, and reptiles many naturally take to be conscious,\nAndrews (2020b) sketches a method she calls the Dynamic Marker\nApproach, which starts by identifying the properties that trigger\nhuman commitments to consciousness in familiar animals, and then\nderives further markers that can be used to identify consciousness in\nunfamiliar ones.\n3.4 Thought\n\nPhilosophical engagement on the nature of belief, concepts,\nperception, mental representation, non-conceptual content,\nrationality, and reasoning deals both with the question of whether\nanimals have capacities related to thought, and with questions about\nthe nature of these capacities. Though there are a lot of contemporary\ndiscussions on these topics, this corresponds to a rather recent turn\nof events, since philosophy of mind has, for the most part,\nhistorically dealt only with human forms of thought. This was not out\nof lack of interest, but the result of the conviction that only humans\nwere capable of thinking. Descartes, for instance, famously argued\nthat animals\u2019 lack of language gives us a good reason to think\nthat they do not have any form of thought or rationality.\n\nDescartes\u2019 view was echoed in the twentieth century by\nphilosopher Donald Davidson. In a well-known article (Davidson 1982),\nhe argued that animals are incapable of thinking due to their lack of\nlanguage. He departs from an example by Norman Malcolm (1972/73): a\ndog is chasing the neighbor\u2019s cat through the backyard. The cat\nruns directly towards an oak tree but at the last minute they swerve\nand go up a maple. The dog misses this last maneuver and runs towards\nthe oak tree, rests their paws on it, and begins to bark at its\nbranches. Though we would be inclined to describe this behavior by\nsaying that the dog believes that the cat is in the oak tree,\nDavidson thinks that we would be wrong.\n\nDavidson first identifies an epistemological problem with attributing\nsuch a belief to the dog; a problem that was already described by\nStephen Stich (1979). The problem boils down to the fact that we lack\na way of determining which description would accurately capture the\ndog\u2019s belief: do they believe the cat went up the oldest tree in\nthe backyard? Or the tree that smells the best? Or the tree that the\ncat went up the last time? This epistemological hurdle is\ninsurmountable, in Davidson\u2019s view. Moreover, for him, beliefs\nare never had in isolation, but rather every belief is embedded in a\nnetwork of associated beliefs without which that initial belief would\nlack all sense. In order to believe of an object that it is a tree,\nthe dog needs all sorts of general beliefs about trees: that they\ngrow; that they have leaves, branches, and roots; that they need water\nand sunlight, etc. And the same goes for the cat: believing that this\nis a cat implies believing that they are a mammal, that they have four\nlegs, that they meow, etc. Even though there is no fixed set of\nbeliefs that one needs in order to be able to believe of this object\nthat it is a tree or a cat, without the attribution of at least some\nof these beliefs, the attribution to the dog of the belief that the\ncat is in the tree becomes senseless.\n\nThough it has been widely discussed, few philosophers have been\nconvinced by this argument. For one, similar problems also arise when\nattributing beliefs to other humans. Furthermore, such arguments are\nexcessively pessimistic with regards to the limits of what we can know\nabout animals\u2019 beliefs. By studying animal behavior in\ncontrolled situations, we can come to know quite a lot about how they\nunderstand the world, which would allow us to delineate their beliefs\nto a much higher degree than Davidson and Stich acknowledge. Moreover,\nperhaps animals\u2019 beliefs don\u2019t take the form of\npropositional attitudes made up of concepts, like Davidson assumes. It\ncould be the case, for instance, that the dog thinks of the cat, not\nas a four-legged meowing mammal, but in terms of the actions they\nallow: as, for instance, a chase-able or eat-able thing. And lastly,\nwhile Davidson\u2019s argument may allow us to conclude that we\ndon\u2019t know the exact form that animals\u2019 beliefs take, a\nnumber of philosophers have argued that we can still ascribe content\nto animal beliefs using a variety of different methods (e.g., Allen\n2013; Berm\u00fadez 2003; Rowlands 2012).\n\nHowever, for Davidson, attributing thought to animals is not merely an\nepistemological problem. It isn\u2019t just that we don\u2019t have\na way of knowing what animals believe; for him, the very idea\nthat animals can think is problematic. Davidson ties the ability to\nthink to the possession of language. He considers that an individual\nwho has beliefs has to be capable of being surprised, for surprise\nconsists precisely of registering that reality isn\u2019t how we\nbelieved it was. Surprise shows that one can discriminate\nbetween the purely subjective and the objective. In order to have the\ncapacity to be surprised, and therefore to have beliefs, one needs the\nconcept of belief, to be able to understand that there is an\nobjective reality that is independent from our beliefs. At the same\ntime, language is necessary to have the concept of belief, for it\nallows us to contrast what we believe with what others believe, and\nthus generate the notion of truth and an objective reality. Given that\nonly humans have language, only humans can have the concept of belief,\nand therefore beliefs. And as, for Davidson, beliefs are the basic\nfoundation for all kinds of thought, only humans can think.\n\nMore recent philosophical engagement on these topics tends to take a\nmore varied and often nuanced view about the relationship between\nlanguage and thought that distinguishes between different kinds of\nthinking. Elisabeth Camp finds evidence that while some animals think\nin compositional representational systems, such systems lack other\nproperties of language and are not propositional in structure (Camp\n2009a). This is in contrast to Jerry Fodor\u2019s Language of Thought\n(LoT) hypothesis, according to which all thought has a language-like\nstructure and can be had by animals who do not use language (Fodor\n1975). On Camp\u2019s view, animals lack propositional thought, but\nsome animals still have conceptual thought because they have\nsystematically recombinable stimulus-independent representational\ncapacities\u2014a flexible capacity to represent different aspects of\nthe world, including abstractions (Camp 2009b). Other philosophers\nargue that the evidence suggests both that animals lack concepts and\nthat they think, providing evidence for nonconceptual mental content\n(e.g., Beck 2012; Peacocke 2001; Schellenberg 2013, 2018).\nContemporary philosophers are also interested in investigating the\nkinds of rational thought processes that animals might engage in,\nincluding logical reasoning (Burge 2010), causal reasoning\n(Berm\u00fadez 2006), or statistical reasoning (Rescorla, 2009,\n2017).\n3.5 Communication\n\nCommunication is another area in which data from animal studies is\nused to help shape philosophical theories. Many take their starting\nposition from H.P. Grice, who proposed that a speaker means something\nby an utterance x if and only if the speaker utters x\nwith the intention that:\n\nit produces a response in the intended audience,\nthe audience recognizes the speaker\u2019s first intention,\nand\nthe audience\u2019s recognition of the speaker\u2019s first\nintention serves as a reason for the audience responding as it does\n(Grice 1957).\n\n\nDennett interprets Grice as concluding that only those being who can\nentertain a third-order belief (e.g., \u201cI think that she thinks\nthat I think\u201d) can be communicators (Dennett 1987). That would\nentail that only creatures who have a theory of mind, and can think\nabout others\u2019 mental states, are able to communicate. More\nrecently, philosophers have objected to the high cognitive\nrequirements for communication, in part by noting that children and\nanimals often appear to be communicating, expressing their thoughts\nand feelings, or exchanging information in a purposeful way. Current\nresearch also takes seriously that communication need not be limited\nto the verbal domain; communication can occur through gestures and\nother bodily movements, touches, and at least in some species, through\nthe flexible release of chemicals.\n\nFor example, Moore (2016b) suggests that intentional communication\nneed only require a message and an \u201cact of address\u201d that\nsignifies that the message is intended for the receiver. This\npragmatic ostensive communicative account of intentional communication\nrequires that communicative partners be able to understand that others\nhave goals, but doesn\u2019t require understanding others\u2019\nbeliefs. Moore thinks we may find evidence of intentional\ncommunication of this sort in animals from fish to apes.\n\nFor there to be communication, there must be thought, and as we saw in\nthe previous section, some philosophers deny that thought is possible\nwithout language. Dorit Bar-On defends a theory of intentional\ncommunication she calls expressive communication, according to which\navowals are self-reports or expressions of one\u2019s current mental\nstates that have both an action component and a semantic component\n(Bar-On 2004). She argues that an appreciation of expressive\ncommunication can help us see how children and animals who lack\nlanguage may yet still have thoughts (Bar-On 2019).\n\nWhile philosophers are finding value in animal behavior to develop\ntheories of communication, there is less impact on theories of\nlanguage. This is perhaps due to the fact that linguists tend to agree\nwith Noam Chomsky that it is \u201cobviously true\u201d that animals\ncan have systems of communication, but lack anything that can be\ncalled a language (Chomsky 1980: 430). However, continued research\ninto animal communication challenges the idea that human language is\ndiscontinuous from animal communication systems, with evidence of\ncapacities supporting recursion in birdsongs (Gentner et al. 2006) and\nsyntax in bonobos (Clay & Zuberb\u00fchler 2011). Appeal to such\nfindings permits better theories regarding the evolution of language\n(Zuberb\u00fchler 2020).\n\nOn the basis of empirical research into the multimodal communication\nof animals, Eva Meijer (2019) has recently argued that, far from being\nobviously true, it is anthropocentric to restrict the term\n\u201clanguage\u201d to human forms of communication. Instead, she\nsuggests using the Wittgensteinian notion of language games to\narticulate a notion of language that is not fixed and universal, but\ninstead incorporates many different forms of communication that bear a\nfamily resemblance without having any one common characteristic. This\nnotion of language games can include much more than just verbal\ncommunication, seeing language instead as something that is embodied,\nopen-ended, ever-changing and embedded in practices of co-creating\nmeaning, something that need not exclude animals.\n3.6 Social understanding\n\nPhilosophical discussions on the nature of social understanding,\nincluding empathy, theory of mind, norms, and culture, have been\ninfluenced in the past couple of decades by the accumulating evidence\non the socio-cognitive capacities of animals. The chimpanzee theory of\nmind controversy, which we outlined in\n section 2,\n is a perfect illustration of this, since it gave rise to numerous\narticles and books that dealt with this topic from a philosophical\nperspective. Many of the early papers focused on what has been termed\nthe \u201clogical problem,\u201d which is the problem that the\nexperimental results can be interpreted by postulating that\nchimpanzees are mindreaders or that they are mere behavior-readers.\nPhilosophers have offered various solutions to this problem, ranging\nfrom experimental proposals that are meant to disentangle these two\nexplanations of the data (Lurz 2011) to attempts to dissolve it by\narguing that it is just a skeptical problem that will not help us\nadvance in our study of animal cognition (Halina 2015).\n\nOther philosophers have been inspired by the chimpanzee theory of mind\ncontroversy to rethink social cognition. Andrews (2012), for instance,\nargued that the chimpanzee theory of mind debate presupposes a view of\nsocial understanding according to which predicting and explaining\nbehavior are two symmetrical activities that depend on the attribution\nof propositional attitudes (beliefs and desires) to others. Instead,\nshe argues that in many cases humans and nonhumans alike can predict\nbehavior without appealing to someone\u2019s beliefs and desires,\npredicting instead from the situation in which the other is in, from\nwhat they themselves would do, based on stereotypes or personality\ntraits, from what that individual did in the past, from social norms,\nby perceiving the individual\u2019s emotional state, and so on. In\ncontrast, the attribution of mental states is more commonly found in\nthe practice of explaining the behavior of others, especially in the\ncase of anomalous behavior. Though chimpanzees and other apes have\nbeen found to pass a false belief task (Buttelmann et al. 2017;\nKrupenye et al. 2016), the chimpanzee theory of mind experiments have\nbeen designed to test for their capacity to predict behavior, not to\nexplain it, so they may not actually be probing into\nchimpanzees\u2019 theory of mind (Andrews 2018). Stephen Butterfill\nand Ian Apperly (2013) also argued that theory of mind tests that have\nbeen performed on children, apes, and other animals can be passed\nwithout attributing full-blown propositional attitudes to others. The\nindividuals can rely instead on what they call a \u201cminimal theory\nof mind,\u201d an ability to register objects and their relations to\nagents that allows one to track propositional attitudes without\nrepresenting them as such. While much of the current discussion of ape\ntheory of mind is methodological, raising worries about the nonverbal\nimplicit methods used in these tests (Horschler, MacLean, & Santos\n2020), there are also philosophical questions to be asked about a\nconstruct that has arisen from the nonverbal tests, namely,\nimplicit belief representation. Implicit knowledge is often\ntaken to be nonrepresentational, as seen in the philosophical\nliterature on knowledge how. To address the questions of what it means\nto say a nonverbal infant or nonhuman animal has a theory of mind\nrequires some conceptual clarifications (Rakoczy 2012).\n\nPhilosophers have more recently been interested in a wider array of\nsocial capacities. Philosophical accounts of social learning (Moore\n2013), culture (Goodrich 2017; Ramsey 2013), innovation (Ramsey,\nBastian, & van Schaik 2007), social norms (Andrews 2020a), and\nanimal morality (Fitzpatrick 2017b; Korsgaard 2006; Mons\u00f3 2015;\nRowlands 2012) are also topics that are informed by current research\nin animal cognition.\n3.7 The influence of animal cognition on value theory\n\nThe evidence coming from comparative cognition also has important\nimplications for our obligations towards animals. In this section, we\nwill give an overview of some of the ways in which comparative\ncognition has influenced ethics and political theory.\n3.7.1 Ethics\n\nEthical theorizing regarding animals focuses on two main issues: the\nquestion of moral status and the question of moral treatment. The\ndiscussion on moral status attempts to establish which animals are\nowed moral consideration and on what grounds. The discussion on moral\ntreatment starts from the assumption that some animals have moral\nstatus and aims to elucidate what the interests of these animals are\nand how to manage situations in which they conflict with our own.\nDiscussions in both of these debates are often informed by comparative\ncognition research.\n\nThe most common capacity that has been used to ground animals\u2019\nmoral status is sentience, roughly defined as the capacity to feel\npleasure and pain. Sentience is widely regarded as sufficient for\nanimals to be owed moral consideration, since only sentient animals\ncare about what happens to them. Early animal ethics focused\non animals most directly and gravely affected by human practices,\nnamely, the mammals and birds used in food production and biomedical\nresearch, and built a case in their defense based on evidence of their\nsentience. In recent years, evidence of sentience in other taxa is\nbeing used to argue that the circle of moral consideration should be\nwidened to include fish (Balcombe 2016; Sneddon 2006), cephalopods\n(King & Marino 2019; Mather & Anderson 2007), and arthropods\n(Mikhalevich & Powell 2020). Evidence from comparative psychology\nthat points to some animals being capable of sophisticated forms of\nagency has also been used in attempts to ground moral status on this\ncapacity (Sebo 2017; Wilcox 2020). Other philosophers object to using\nindividualistic cognitive capacities to ground moral standing, and\ninstead rely on our perception of animals and pre-existing\nrelationships as the relevant properties (Crary 2010; Diamond 1978;\nGruen 2015). However, it has been argued that even these approaches\ncannot ignore the cognitive capacities of individuals (Mons\u00f3\n& Grimm 2019).\n\nIf animals have moral status, the question emerges: what sort of\ntreatment are they owed? Moral treatment is usually considered to be a\nfunction of the interests that a being has, and these are\nclosely linked to their psychological capacities. Inspired by findings\nin comparative cognition, scholars have argued that some animals not\nonly have an interest in experiencing pleasure and avoiding pain, but\nthat they can also enjoy other goods, such as freedom (Gruen 2018;\nSchmidt 2015), friendship (Fr\u00f6\u00f6ding & Peterson 2011),\nrelationships of care (Mons\u00f3, Benz-Schwarzburg, & Bremhorst\n2018), and meaning (Purves & Delon 2018). This has potential\nimplications for the moral treatment that animals are owed, because it\ncould mean that animals are not just wronged when they are made to\nfeel pain, but also when they are deprived of opportunities to enjoy\nthese other goods.\n3.7.2 Political theory\n\nRecent years have witnessed a political turn in animal ethics, with\nthe appearance of several theories that discuss how political\ninstitutions and processes can be transformed to guarantee justice for\nanimals (Cochrane, Garner, & O\u2019Sullivan 2018). This work is\nsomewhat less capacity-oriented than traditional animal ethics, since\nit does not focus on the moral obligations of individual humans\ntowards animals, and tends to highlight instead the sorts of\nobligations that are generated at the state level by the relationships\nthat humans have historically held with animals (Donaldson &\nKymlicka 2011).\n\nStill, some of the work in political theory has been influenced by\nfindings in comparative cognition. An example of this is the debate\nsurrounding the notion of personhood, a term that marks those beings\nwho are entitled to legal protection, and which is often linked to\ncertain cognitive capacities, such as rationality, self-awareness, or\nsociality. Drawing on the accumulating psychological evidence,\nscholars have defended that personhood should be granted to great apes\n(Andrews et al. 2018; Cavalieri & Singer 1993), cetaceans\n(Cavalieri 2011; White 2007), and elephants (Poole 1998). The\ncapacities of animals documented by comparative cognition have also\nbeen used to defend different ways in which animals can be seen as\nhaving a political agency of their own, and thus as capable of\nengaging in political participation. Meijer (2019), for instance, has\nargued that animals can communicate in complex and nuanced ways using\nmultimodal signals, and that by means of these they can express their\nneeds and negotiate their relationships with us. Rather than seeing\nthem merely as voiceless victims, she encourages us to take their\nvoices into account when shaping an interspecies democracy.\n3.8 Summary\n\nThe philosophy of animal minds is a rich and growing area of\nphilosophy. Philosophers engage with the science of animal cognition\nto analyze the methods, assumptions, and values in the science itself.\nPhilosophers also use the research findings to support theories in\ntraditional topics in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind,\nlanguage and action, and value theory. Finally, attention to animal\ncognition can also highlight previously overlooked philosophical\nissues related to the nature of culture, learning, and teaching, and\nit provides a new lens to consider classic questions about human\nnature and our place among all the other animals.\n",
