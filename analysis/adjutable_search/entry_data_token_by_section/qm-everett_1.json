    "main_text": "The Measurement Problem\n2. The Measurement Problem\n\nEverett presented the relative-state formulation of pure wave\nmechanics as a way of avoiding the conceptual problems encountered by\nthe standard von Neumann collapse formulation of quantum mechanics.\nEverett took the chief problem to be that the standard theory required\nobservers to be treated as external to the system described by the\ntheory. One consequence of this, he thought, was that the theory\nconsequently fails to provide a consistent description the physical\nuniverse. Everett distinguished between the standard von Neumann\nformulation of quantum mechanics and Bohr\u2019s Copenhagen\ninterpretation. He believed that the latter was in an important sense\nyet less satisfactory as it did not even aim to provide a consistent\ndescription of the process of observation (1956, 152\u20133). We will\nfollow the main argument of Everett\u2019s long thesis starting with\nthe measurement problem as encountered by the standard collapse\ntheory.\n\nThe standard collapse formulation of quantum mechanics, as Everett\nunderstood it, is based on the following principles (von Neumann,\n1955):\n\nRepresentation of States: The state of a physical\nsystem \\(S\\) is represented by an element of unit length in a Hilbert\nspace, a complex-valued vector space with an inner product.\nRepresentation of Observables: Every physical\nobservable \\(O\\) is represented by a Hermitian operator\n\\(\\boldsymbol{O}\\) on the Hilbert space representing states, and every\nHermitian operator corresponds to some physical observable.\nEquivalently, the observable \\(O\\) can be thought of as being\nrepresented by the orthonormal basis consisting of the eigenvectors of\n\\(\\boldsymbol{O}\\).\nStandard Interpretation of States: A system \\(S\\)\nhas a determinate value for an observable \\(O\\), and hence\ndeterminately has the corresponding physical property, if and only if\nthe state of \\(S\\) is represented by an eigenvector of\n\\(\\boldsymbol{O}\\). If so, then one would with certainty get the\ncorresponding eigenvalue as the result of measuring \\(O\\) of\n\\(S\\).\nTwo Dynamical Laws: (a) If\nno measurement is made, then a system \\(S\\)\nevolves in a continuous deterministic way according to the linear\ndynamics, which depends only on the energy properties of the system.\n(b) If a measurement is\nmade of \\(S\\), then the system instantaneously and randomly jumps to\nan eigenstate of the observable being measured. The probability of\neach possible post-measurement state is equal to the norm squared of\nthe projection of the initial state onto the final state.\n\n\nEverett referred to the standard von Neumann theory as the\n\u201cexternal observation formulation of quantum mechanics\u201d\nand discussed it in both the long (1956) and short (1957) versions of\nhis thesis (beginning on pages 73 and 175 respectively). While he\nbelieved that the standard collapse theory was ultimately\nunacceptable, he used it as the starting point for his presentation of\npure wave mechanics. The latter theory he characterized as the\nstandard collapse theory but without the collapse dynamics (rule 4b).\nWe will briefly consider the roles played by rule (4a) and (4b) and\nthe measurement problem then consider Everett\u2019s discussion of\nthe Wigner\u2019s Friend story and his proposal for replacing the\nstandard theory with pure wave mechanics.\n\nThe linear dynamics (rule 4a) plays an essential role in the standard\ncollapse theory. It explains how a system might come to be in a\nsuperpositions of different classical states and how two systems may\ncome to be quantum-mechanically entangled, which in turn explains\nquantum inference effects and quantum nonlocality. But given the\nstandard interpretation of states (rule 3), the linear dynamics cannot\non its own explain how measurements yield determinate measurement\nrecords that exhibit the standard quantum probabilities. For most\ninitial states, the linear dynamics predicts that a measurement\ninteraction would produce a physical record in an entangled\nsuperposition of recording mutually incompatible measurement results,\nsomething like state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) below). On the standard\ninterpretation of states, this is not a state where there is any\ndeterminate physical record at all. Hence, the collapse dynamics (rule\n4b) is apparently essential to how the standard theory explains\ndeterminate physical records, and in doing so it also explains why one\nshould expect each physically possible record with the usual quantum\nprobabilities.\n\nThe deterministic linear dynamics (rule 4a), then, describes how a\nsystem evolves when there is no measurement, and the\nstochastic nonlinear dynamics (rule 4b) describes how a system evolves\nwhen there is a measurement. Note that the term\nmeasurement occurs in the theory as an undefined primitive\nterm. Without saying what it takes for an interaction to count as a\nmeasurement, the theory is at best incomplete since it does not\nindicate when each dynamical law obtains. Further, if one supposes\nthat observers and their measuring devices are physical systems like\nany other (and why wouldn\u2019t they be?), they must also evolve in\na continuous deterministic way, and nothing like the random,\ndiscontinuous evolution described by rule 4b can ever occur. In this\ncase, stipulating a collapse on measurement yields an immediate\ncontradiction. This is the quantum measurement problem. See Barrett\n(2020) and the section on the measurement problem in the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory\n for further discussions.\n\nEverett took the standard formulation of quantum mechanics to be\nlogically inconsistent, and hence untenable, because it did not allow\none to provide a consistent account of nested measurement. He\nillustrated the problem in the context of an \u201camusing, but\nextremely hypothetical drama\u201d (1956, 74\u20138), a\nstory that was famously retold by Eugene Wigner (1961) a few years\nlater.\n\nEverett\u2019s version of the Wigner\u2019s Friend story involved an\nobserver \\(A\\) who knows the state function of some system \\(S\\), and\nknows that it is not an eigenstate of the observable he is about to\nmeasure of it, and an observer \\(B\\) who is in possession of the state\nfunction of the composite system \\(A{+}S\\). Observer \\(A\\) believes\nthat the outcome of her measurement on \\(S\\) will be randomly\ndetermined by rule 4b, hence \\(A\\) attributes to \\(A{+}S\\) a\npost-measurement state describing \\(A\\) as having a determinate\nmeasurement record and \\(S\\) as having collapsed to the corresponding\nstate. Observer \\(B\\), however, attributes the state function of the\nroom after \\(A\\)\u2019s measurement according to the rule 4a, hence\n\\(B\\) attributes to \\(A{+}S\\) an entangled state where, according to\nrule 3, neither \\(A\\) nor \\(S\\) even has a determinate\nquantum-mechanical state of its own. Everett held that since \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) make incompatible state attributions to \\(A{+}S\\), the standard\ncollapse theory commits one to a straightforward contradiction.\n\nIt would be extraordinarily difficult in practice to isolate and\ncontrol a composite system like \\(A{+}S\\) in such a way that \\(B\\)\nwould be able even to calculate how its state evolves. This is one of\nthe reasons Everett referred to the drama as \u201cextremely\nhypothetical\u201d. But he was also careful to explain why this\npractical difficulty was irrelevant to the conceptual problem faced by\nthe standard theory. Indeed, he explicitly rejected that one might\nsimply \u201cdeny the possibility that \\(B\\) could ever be in\npossession of the state function of \\(A{+}S\\).\u201d Rather, he\nargued, that \u201cno matter what the state of \\(A{+}S\\) is, there is\nin principle a complete set of commuting operators for which it is an\neigenstate, so that, at least, the determination of these\nquantities will not affect the state nor in any way disrupt the\noperation of \\(A\\),\u201d nor, he added, are there \u201cfundamental\nrestrictions in the usual theory about the knowability of any\nstate functions.\u201d And he concluded that \u201cit is not\nparticularly relevant whether or not \\(B\\) actually knows the\nprecise state function of \\(A{+}S\\). If he merely believes\nthat the system is described by a state function, which he does not\npresume to know, then the difficulty still exists. He must then\nbelieve that this state function changed deterministically, and hence\nthat there was nothing probabilistic in \\(A\\)\u2019s\ndetermination\u201d (1956, 76). And, Everett argued, \\(B\\) is right\nin so believing.\n\nIt is a key feature of both Everett\u2019s understanding of the\nmeasurement problem and how his own formulation of quantum mechanics\nworked that \\(B\\) might in principle show by means of an interference\nmeasurement that the state resulting from \\(A\\)\u2019s interaction\nwith \\(S\\) was in fact the entangled superposition of incompatible\nrecords predicted by the linear dynamics (a state like\n\\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) below). Indeed, that it is always in\nprinciple possible to make such a measurement is why Everett held\nevery element of the superposition to be real: \u201cIt is \u2026\nimproper to attribute any less validity or \u2018reality\u2019 to\nany element of a superposition than any other element, due to this\never present possibility of obtaining interference effects between the\nelements. All elements of a superposition must be regarded as\nsimultaneously existing\u201d (1956, 150).\n\nThat Everett took the Wigner\u2019s Friend story, which involves an\nexperiment that would be virtually impossible to perform because of\nenvironmental decoherence effects, to pose the central conceptual\nproblem for quantum mechanics is essential to understanding how he\nthought of the measurement problem and what it would take to solve it.\nIn particular, he held that one only has a satisfactory solution to\nthe quantum measurement problem if one can account for nested\nmeasurement in a consistent way. Being able to tell the Wigner\u2019s\nFriend story in one\u2019s theory is a necessary condition for a\nsatisfactory resolution of the quantum measurement problem.\n",
