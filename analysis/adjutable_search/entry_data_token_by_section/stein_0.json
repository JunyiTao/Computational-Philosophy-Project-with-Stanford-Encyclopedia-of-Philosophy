    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nEdith Stein was born on 12 October 1891 into a bourgeois Jewish family\nin Breslau, Prussia (now Wroclaw, Poland). Her father died when she\nwas two, leaving her mother to run the family business\u2014a\nlumberyard\u2014while raising seven children. Edith attended local\nschool and then the Victoria Gymnasium in Breslau. Having graduated\nfirst in her class in the Abitur in 1911, Stein entered the University\nof Breslau to study psychology. Her professors included William Stern\nand Richard H\u00f6nigswald. Another professor, Georg Moskiewicz,\nintroduced her to Husserl\u2019s Logical Investigations and\nremarked that in G\u00f6ttingen the students philosophize day and\nnight and talk only of the phenomenon. Inspired, she transferred to\nG\u00f6ttingen in 1913. There she became an active member of the\nG\u00f6ttingen Philosophical Society, that included Reinach, Ingarden,\nand Conrad-Martius. In G\u00f6ttingen she also attended\nScheler\u2019s lectures, which left a deep impression. Stein\napproached Husserl to write a doctorate on phenomenology, and his\ninitial reaction was to recommend instead that she sit the state\nteaching examination. However, encouraged by Reinach, she completed\nher thesis in summer 1916 and graduated summa cum laude for\nher dissertation, Das Einf\u00fchlungsproblem in seiner\nhistorischen Entwicklung und in ph\u00e4nomenologischer\nBetrachtung (The Empathy Problem as it Developed Historically and\nConsidered Phenomenologically), part of which was published as Zum\nProblem der Einf\u00fchlung (On the Problem of Empathy;\nStein 1917).\n\nWhen Reinach died in the Great War in 1917, Stein helped edit his\ncollected writings. She then worked as Husserl\u2019s first paid\nassistant from October 1916 until February 1918, when she resigned in\nfrustration. She transcribed and edited, with major interventions,\nHusserl\u2019s research manuscripts, including Ideas II\n(finally published in 1952), and his Lectures on the Consciousness\non Internal Time (1905\u20131917), that was eventually brought\nto press by Heidegger in 1928 (with only the slightest acknowledgment\nof Stein\u2019s involvement). Stein\u2019s letters to Ingarden\nreveal that she was unable to interest Husserl in her revisions.\n\nStein campaigned to be allowed to register for a Habilitation,\nhitherto denied to women. She applied to G\u00f6ttingen in 1919 but\nwas rejected. Husserl\u2019s letter of recommendation of 6 February\n1919 (Husserl 1994: 548\u2013549) was not particularly supportive.\nShe wrote a major study intended as her Habilitation thesis,\nBeitr\u00e4ge zur philosophischen Begr\u00fcndung der Psychologie\nund der Geisteswissenschaften (1922), published in\nHusserl\u2019s Jahrbuch.\n\nFailing to find a mentor for her Habilitation, Stein returned to\nBreslau to offer private philosophical tutorials. Stein\u2019s close\nfriends there were the phenomenologists Theodor Conrad and Hedwig\nMartius. At their home, Stein read St. Theresa of Avila\u2019s\nautobiography and immediately felt she had found the truth. She soon\nconverted to Catholicism. Her conversion deeply disappointed her\nmother and many of her Jewish friends.\n\nShe began studying Thomas Aquinas intensely and translated his De\nVeritate (Stein 2008a,b). In 1930 she sought again to register\nfor the Habilitation, contacting Heidegger at Freiburg, who was\nreasonably supportive. By 1931 she had completed a new Habilitation\nthesis Potency and Act (1931). However, she was appointed to\na teaching post at the German Institute for Scientific Pedagogy in\nM\u00fcnster, which disrupted her Habilitation plans. She also thought\nthe work inadequate and embarked on a new study, Finite and\nEternal Being (1950/2006).\n\nFollowing the rise to power of the National Socialists in Germany, on\n19 April 1933 Stein, because of her Jewish descent, was dismissed from\nher position in M\u00fcnster. In October 1933, she entered the\nCarmelite convent at Cologne. In April 1934, she entered the\nnovitiate, taking the religious name Teresa Benedicta of the Cross\n(Teresia Benedicta a Cruce). In 1938, Stein was transferred for safety\nto the Carmelite convent at Echt, Holland. There she wrote her two\nmost important theological treatises, The Science of the\nCross (2003) and Ways to Know God (1993).\n\nThe condemnation of Nazi anti-Semitism by the Dutch bishops, on 26\nJuly 1942, provoked the German authorities to arrest non-Aryan Roman\nCatholics. With her sister Rosa, also a Catholic convert, Teresa\nBenedicta was arrested in Echt by the Gestapo on 2 August 1942 and\nshipped to Auschwitz concentration camp, arriving on August 7. She\ndied with her sister Rosa on 9 August 1942. Survivors of the death\ncamp testified that she assisted other sufferers with great\ncompassion. At a ceremony in Cologne on 1 May 1987, Pope John Paul II\nbeatified Edith Stein, and canonized her in 1998. Her interrupted\nautobiography, Life in a Jewish Family (1985), was published\nposthumously.\n",
