Pattern (li)\n\nOne of the most notable differences between classical Confucianism and\nNeo-Confucianism in the Song-Ming period is the prominence of\nmetaphysical speculation in the latter. Many Daoxue\nConfucians believed that providing an adequate account of the world\nrequired that we posit the existence of some things that are formless\n(xing er shang \u5f62\u800c\u4e0a) and not readily\napparent, the existence of which poses philosophical challenges. Most\nnotably, these Confucians thought we needed something they called\nPattern (li, also translated as \u201cprinciple\u201d) to\naccount for order, unity, and the nature and content of the virtues.\nThey also thought that Pattern is closely linked to human nature, and\nthey were interested in explaining how human cognitive and emotional\nfaculties\u2014what they called the heartmind (xin \u5fc3,\nsometimes translated more simply as \u201cheart\u201d or as\n\u201cmind\u201d)\u2014can come to recognize and respond\nappropriately to Pattern.\n",
