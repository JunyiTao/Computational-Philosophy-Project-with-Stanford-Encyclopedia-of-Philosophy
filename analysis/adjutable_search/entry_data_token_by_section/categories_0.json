    "main_text": "Category Systems || Aristotelian Realism\n1.1 Aristotelian Realism\n\nPhilosophical interest in categories may be traced back to Aristotle\nwho, in his treatise Categories, attempts to enumerate the\nmost general kinds into which entities in the world divide. He does\nnot begin from a single highest kind, but rather lists the following\nas the ten highest categories of things \u201csaid without any\ncombination\u201d (Categories 1b25):\n\nSubstance (e.g., man, horse)\nQuantity (e.g., four-foot, five-foot)\nQuality (e.g., white, grammatical)\nRelation (e.g., double, half)\nPlace (e.g., in the Lyceum, in the market-place)\nDate (e.g., yesterday, last year)\nPosture (e.g., is lying, is sitting)\nState (e.g., has shoes on, has armor on)\nAction (e.g., cutting, burning)\nPassion (e.g., being cut, being burned)\n\n\nThere are two sorts of substance: a primary substance is, e.g., an\nindividual man or horse; the species (and genera) of these\nindividuals (e.g., man, animal) are secondary\nsubstances. While the ten categories are all equally highest kinds,\nprimary substances nonetheless have a certain sort of priority, since\n\u201call the other things are either said of the primary substances\nas subjects or in them as subjects. So if the primary substances did\nnot exist it would be impossible for any of the other things to\nexist\u201d (Categories 2b4).\n\nElsewhere, in Metaphysics (998b22), Aristotle argues\nexplicitly that there cannot be a highest genus (e.g., of\nbeing or unity) shared by entities of different\ncategories (cf. Ackrill 1963, 81). For a species is defined in terms\nof its subsuming genus and differentia (e.g., man is definable as an\nanimal that is rational), and while the genus (animal) may be\npredicated of the species (man), it may not be predicated of the\ndifferentia (rational). As a result, if being (or unity) were\na genus, no differentiae could be said to have being (or to be one);\nbut \u201cthe differentiae of any genus must each of them both have\nbeing and be one\u201d (Metaphysics 998b22\u20133).\n\nThe ancient Greek term \u2018kategoria\u2019 described what could be\nsaid against someone in a court of law, and indeed Aristotle uses what\ncan be said of or in a subject as a route to\ndistinguishing categories. There is controversy in the literature,\nhowever, about precisely how he arrived at his categories (Studtmann\n2007). On one prominent interpretation, put forward by J. L. Ackrill,\nAristotle arrived at his list of categories by way of distinguishing\n\u201cdifferent questions which may be asked about something\u201d\nand noting \u201cthat only a limited range of answers can be\nappropriately given to any particular question\u201d (Ackrill 1963,\n78\u20139), e.g., the question \u2018what is it\u2019 can only be\nasked of a substance, and only answers describing substances are\nappropriate. The question \u2018how much\u2019, by contrast,\nrequires a quantity for an answer, and so on.\n\nBut although on this interpretation Aristotle seems to have arrived at\nhis categories by considering different sorts of question and answer,\nthe categories he was offering were supposed to be categories of\nentities, not of language; language was just a clue to truths about\nthe world. As J. L. Ackrill writes, Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories \u201cis not primarily or explicitly about names,\nbut about the things that names signify\u2026Aristotle relies\ngreatly on linguistic facts and tests, but his aim is to discover\ntruths about non-linguistic items\u201d (1963, 71).\n\nOther interpretations have also been suggested about how\nAristotle\u2019s categories were derived. Some hold that\nAristotle\u2019s list was arrived at by reflecting on grammatical\ncategories, and assuming a parallelism between structures of language\nand structures of the world (Baumer 1993). But others have developed\ninterpretations that do not consider Aristotle to have arrived at his\ncategories by considering linguistic matters such as grammatical\nstructure or the questions we may ask. Instead, they take them to\narise from more worldly considerations such as which types of entity\nany sensible particular must be related to (Moravcsik 1967). For an\noverview of the interpretive options, see Studtmann (2007).\n\nIn any case, regardless of how the categories were derived,\nAristotle\u2019s approach to categories is generally taken to be in\nthe spirit of what Brian Carr calls \u201ccategorial realism\u201d\n\u2013 an approach conceiving of a system of categories as a list of\nthe highest genera of beings (not merely of language or thought\n\u2013 even if those may be used in deriving the metaphysical\ncategories). As Studtmann (2007) puts it, Aristotle \u201c assumes\nrather than defends a posture of realism with respect to the\nmetaphysical structures of the world\u201d. Given this approach, a\ncomplete system of categories would offer a systematic inventory of\nwhat there is, considered at the most abstract level (although it is\nnot clear whether Aristotle intended his categories to be exhaustive).\nThus on a categorial realist approach, providing a system of\ncategories can be seen as one, or even the central task of\nmetaphysics (cf. Grossman 1983, 3). Such a system of categories may\nalso play a central role in answering individual questions of nature,\nproviding the most general sort of answer to questions of the form\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d, and providing the basis for definitions\nof narrower sorts of things by specifying the most general category\n(genus) under which things of this sort fall, and the differentia that\ndistinguishes them from other things of the same category. This has\nendured as the paradigmatic approach to categories, and several recent\nauthors have offered new theories of categories in this spirit of\nAristotelian realism (see \u00a71.4 below).\n",
