But what is the relationship between this \u201cextra\u201d consciousness and the consciousness we ordinarily believe in, the consciousness we pre-theoretically associate with humans and other animals?\nDavid Chalmers (2015) distinguishes between constitutive and non-constitutive forms of panpsychism, a distinction I present here in a slightly modified form:\n\nConstitutive panpsychism\u2014Forms of panpsychism according to which facts about human and animal consciousness are not fundamental, but are grounded in more fundamental kinds of consciousness, e.g., facts about micro-level consciousness.\nNon-Constitutive panpsychism\u2014Forms of panpsychism according to which facts about human and animal consciousness are among the fundamental facts.[9]\n\nThe most common form of constitutive panpsychism is:\n\nConstitutive Micropsychism\u2014The view that all facts are grounded in consciousness-involving facts at the micro-level.\n\nPhilosophers use the word \u2018grounding\u2019 to refer to the kind of non-causal explanatory relationship that holds, for example, between the fact that there is a party at Bill\u2019s house and the fact that Bill and his friends are dancing, drinking etc. The revelling of Bill and his pals do not cause a party to come into being, in the way the magical dancing of wizards may cause a spirit to come into existence. The relationship is more intimate than that: the fact that there is a party wholly consists in the fact that certain people are dancing, drinking, etc. Likewise, according to constitutive panpsychism, the fact that I am conscious wholly consists in the fact that certain particles in my brain are arranged in, or interacting in, a certain way (see the entry on metaphysical grounding for more discussion of the grounding relation). This is the form of panpsychism that suffers most acutely from the combination problem, which we will explore below. However, if it can be made sense of, constitutive micropsychism promises an elegant and parsimonious view of nature, with all the richness of nature accounted for in terms of facts at the micro-level. Luke Roelofs (2019) has developed a particularly detailed form of constitutive micropsychism.\nTurning to non-constitutive forms of panpsychism, we should note that by saying that human and animal consciousness is not \u201cfundamental\u201d, we simply mean that it is not grounded in micro-level consciousness. This does not imply that human/animal consciousness is not caused by micro-level consciousness. Indeed, non-constitutive panpsychism typically takes the form of some kind of emergentism, according to which the conscious minds of humans and animals arise as a causal product of interactions between micro-level conscious subjects.\nEmergentist panpsychism in turn takes two forms. Gregg Rosenberg (2004) and Godehard Br\u00fcntrup (2016) have each defended a form of layered emergentism, according to which human minds co-exist with the micro-level conscious subjects that give rise to them and sustain them throughout their existence. The resulting picture is structurally similar to the \u201cBritish emergentism\u201d of the 19th and early 20th century: in both pictures new fundamental entities and forces appear when matter reaches a certain level of complexity.[10] However, panpsychist emergentists are arguably committed to a less radical form of emergence than non-panpsychist emergentists, as the emergent entities are of the same kind as the micro-level entities from which they emerge.\nWilliam Seager (2016) and Hedda Hassel M\u00f8rch (2014, 2018) have independently defended a non-layered form of panpsychist emergentism, which we can call \u201cfusionism\u201d. According to fusionism, when micro-level subjects come together to form a human mind they don\u2019t compose it as bricks compose a house, rather they as it were fuse into it, ceasing to exist in the process. On Seager\u2019s view the post-fusion conscious brain entirely lacks parts; it is a \u201cbig simple\u201d. On M\u00f8rch\u2019s view the post-fusion conscious brain still has parts, but whereas pre-fusion the brain was dependent for its existence on its parts, post-fusion the parts are dependent for their existence upon the brain. M\u00f8rch develops her view as a form of the integrated information theory of consciousness, a leading neuroscientific theory of consciousness which arguably has panpsychist implications (for more on the integrated information theory of consciousness, see the entry on the neuroscience of consciousness).\nBy taking human and animal consciousness to be fundamental, rather than somehow made up of more basic forms of consciousness, emergentists avoid some forms of the combination problem (discussed below). However, this comes at the cost of having an empirically more risky view. It is natural to think that emergent fundamental features of reality would introduce radically new causal powers, and hence it ought to be possible in principle to observe the difference they make in the world when they come into existence. David Papineau (2001) has argued (i) that neuroscience and cellular biology show no sign of the existence of distinctive causal powers associated with biological consciousness, and (ii) that this counts strongly against emergentism of any kind.\n",
