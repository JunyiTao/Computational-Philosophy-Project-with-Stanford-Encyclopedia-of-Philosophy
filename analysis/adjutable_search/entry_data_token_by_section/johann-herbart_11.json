    "main_text": "Aesthetics & ethics || Ethics\n4.2 Ethics\nAll evaluative judgments are aesthetic; they evaluate the\nrepresented relations in their object. Practical philosophy\nor ethics evaluates relations of the will. Therefore, ethical\njudgments are a kind of aesthetic judgment (cf. SW VII: 10; SW X: 309;\nBeiser 2014: 108; 125, ff.). Because such judgments often conflict,\nthe task of practical philosophy is not to pass judgment itself, but\nto cause us to judge correctly. Hence, all practical philosophy can\nand should do is to \u201ccorrectly present the object, [in such a\nway] as to be perfectly grasped\u201d, that object being relations of\nthe will (SW II: 334); thus, as figured bass presents a theory of\nbeautiful tonal relations, practical philosophy seeks the \u201cwhole\nset of relations by which the will becomes the object of\npraise or blame\u201d (SW IX: 329: n.*). Like Kant, Herbart holds\nthat the determining grounds of moral action must be found in a\npriori norms, and rejects eudemonism or any \u201cmaterial\nmotives\u201d as grounds for practical laws (cf. Beiser 2014: 94,\n125, ff.). For Herbart as for Kant, morally evaluative judgments are\nto be made solely with an eye to the \u201cform of the will\u201d,\nwhich ethics determines.\n4.2.1 The object of practical judgment\nPractical judgment judges the \u201cwill\u201d, a species of\ndesire marked by determinate cognition and fixing of its object, and\nby conviction that the object is attainable. While I might desire to\nleap tall buildings in a bound, I cannot will it (SW II: 99). Now the\nvalue of the will\u2019s object cannot determine its evaluation,\nsince Herbart like Kant excludes all material grounds as determinative\nof moral action. Hence the will itself is the object of\nevaluation\u2014but how? Because every instance of willing is\nnonetheless bound to its object, individual acts of willing\ncannot be the object of moral evaluation. Further, an act of willing\nisolated from its object also cannot be the object of moral\nevaluation, since\n\notherwise, the difference between a good and evil\nwill would disappear: willing and willing-well would be one and the\nsame. (Weiss 1928: 122)\nHerbart\u2019s solution to the dilemma is to say that practical\nphilosophy considers the will not in itself, but only insofar as it\nenters into relation with another\nwill.[68] It\nis these various possible relations among wills\nthat constitute the possible forms of the will, and that are judged\nfine or shameful by practical judgment (SW X: 348). In this way, the\naesthetic elements and paradigmatic Ideas of general aesthetics\ngovern practical philosophy, as well.\n4.2.2 The paradigms or Ideas of practical philosophy\nHerbart identifies five such elementary relations of will that\ndemand aesthetic approval, viz., the Ideas of inner freedom;\nperfection; benevolence; right; fairness/justice (SW II: 356). The\nfirst Idea is the Idea of Ideas, i.e., the general decision\nor determination of the will always \u201cto act in accordance with\nthe patterns as patterns, in accordance with taste in\ngeneral\u201d (SW II: 357). Unlike the other Ideas, inner freedom is\na paradigm that is unconditionally pleasing, and which therefore does\nnot need to be commanded. On the other hand, the will can easily come\ninto conflict with the other four paradigms, and such conflict\nis displeasing. The insight of practical judgment into the\nparadigmatic pleasing-ness of the Ideas therefore makes itself felt as\na demand to neutralize that conflict:\n\n[t]he ethical commandment springs solely out of\njudgments of displeasure, and appears when, and for as long as, a\nwilling conflicts with the practical Idea.\n4.2.3 The virtuous human being\nHerbart\u2019s Doctrine of Ideas naturally leads to the notion of\nvirtue or human excellence, for \u201cthe ideal, complete realization\nof inner freedom [just] is the virtue of the\nindividual\u201d (Weiss 1928: 145; cf. SW II: 409, ff.,\nesp. 411\u201312). Here we advance from aesthetic pleasure in the\nparadigms of the will to their actual realization: \u201cVirtue does\nnot forever stay home but strides forth into an alien world\u201d (SW\nII: 414). Thus the individual who sees and approves of the practical\nIdeas also feels compelled to enact them in a coherent way of\nlife. This unity is the Ideal of virtue, according to which\n\u201cno part of [practical] insight may lack the corresponding\nwill[,] and there should be no lack of connection among its\nparts\u201d (SW II: 412). The virtuous life must exclude vice and\nlack of virtue, and react to the situations that at every turn demand\nvirtue\u2019s activity (SW II: 412\u201313).\nInstead of an indefinitely ramifying list of duties to achieve this\nideal, Herbart proposes that the sense of art or Kunstsinn\ncan help us gain an overview of virtue (SW II: 415). That is,\nlife\u2019s circumstances appear as a matter to be formed, and the\nvirtuous person is able to judge the finest way in which a\nsituation should be handled (SW II: 416). But because the artistic\nsense is in constant conflict with external forces and internal\nfeelings, it must be continually rekindled (SW II: 417). Hence, the\nIdeal of virtue can be at best asymptotically approached and it is\nthis approach that Herbart calls \u201cmorality\u201d. Since an\napproach implies a temporal sequence, human life may be understood as\na chain of ethical actions and passions (SW II: 417, f.).\nHerbart analyzes this chain into three main parts. First, there is\nvirtue as \u201cthe picture of a beautiful reality\u201d, belonging\nto imagination, dream, and fantasy, in which the need for intervening\nin reality is lacking: the Ideas are simply assumed as universally\neffective (SW II: 417\u201318). Second, the need to act arises, and\nthe striving will encounters obstacles even within the sphere of\nthought.  Finally, we really act, and try to realize the beautiful\nworld of thought (SW II: 418). While social reality hampers the\nachievement of virtue, the individual, conscious of his inner freedom,\nmust try to find all possible avenues towards moral fulfillment (Weiss\n1928: 156).  It is in preparing the individual for a life of moral\naction that education is required.\n5. Pedagogy\nHerbart writes:\nThe sole and entire task of education\n[Erziehung] is encompassed by the concept,\n\u201cmorality\u201d [Moralit\u00e4t]. (SW I: 259)\n\n If virtue is the realization of human freedom,\nthen the goal of Herbartian education is to make the\nchild capable of living virtuously, viz., by forming the\npupil\u2019s character. For reasons that will become clearer below,\nHerbart identifies moral character with a \u201cmany-sided\u201d\ncharacter. Many-sidedness is a regulative ideal guiding one\u2019s\nstriving towards full individuality: the teacher helps the pupil\ndevelop all his[69]\n unique talents and interests as far and as\ncoherently as possible. That is, the teacher helps the pupil\nsystematically connect his interests around the central principle\nthat is his\n self.[70]\n5.1 Many-sidedness and \u201cinterest\u201d\nInstruction aiming at many-sidedness has two main phases,\n\u201cengrossment\u201d (Vertiefung) and\n\u201creflection\u201d (Besinnung), each of which in turn\nhas a \u201cresting\u201d and a \u201cprogressive\u201d moment:\nresting engrossment is \u201cclarity\u201d; progressive engrossment\nis \u201cassociation\u201d; resting reflection is\n\u201csystem\u201d; progressive reflection is \u201cmethod\u201d\n(SW II: 38, ff.; cf. esp. Gl\u00f6ckner 1892; Beiser 2014:\n106\u20137). It is important to note that these phases of learning\nrecapitulate the process of apperception. That is, clarity occurs\nwhen a representation or representational series comes into full\nconsciousness, where it hovers in the full light of attention. One is\nengrossed in it, which is simply to say, one is not aware\nof anything else. But of course the child\u2019s mind rarely stays\noccupied with a single representation for long; its imagination\n(Phantasie) rapidly leads it, usually by association, to\nother, similar representations (SW II: 40).  This spontaneity of\nabsorption in environing objects is the source of a natural\nmany-sidedness, and thus the seed of the fully formed personality. While the phases of engrossment are natural to all human\nbeings, it is obvious that in themselves they have no direction or\norganizing \n principle.[71]\nThe teacher does not simply give the principle to the\nchild. Rather, his instruction aims to bring the child by stages to\nrecognize the principle on and as its own, by reflecting on\nits immediate experience. The child\u2019s maturity determines the\nscope of reflection, but she will always fall short of the full\nself-reflection characteristic of the adult. Since many-sidedness\ndepends on reflection for its full solidity, the child can also only\never approximate adult versatility and virtue (PS I: 149). For\nHerbart, the teacher promotes reflection by promoting what he calls\nthe child\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d (Interesse). Now,\nthe child\u2019s natural engrossment in its activities must be\nrespected as symbols of its individuality. At the same time,\nengrossment is a kind of seclusion, whereas interest is an opening up\nof the person in and to the \nworld.[72]\n Step by step, the teacher must lead the\npupil to become an interested, active learner, who desires not to\npossess knowledge, but to hover \u201cbetween merely\nspectating [on the one hand] and grasping [on the other]\u201d\n(cf. SW II: 42).\nThe first phase of interest is noticing objects:\n\nthe noticed object not only stands forth for a\ncertain duration from the flow of psychic activity, but also aids the\nreproduction of suppressed representations. (Weiss 1928: 194; cf. SW\nII: 42; 53)\n\n As other representations rise, new, imagined\nrepresentations are anticipated (as we saw frequently happens in\napperception). Should an imagined representation be perfectly\nrepresented, it will naturally provoke an aesthetic judgment of\napproval. This leads to a \u201cdemand\u201d for the imagined\nobject, i.e., an overpowering sense for its realization; and this\ndemand finally expresses itself in action in the world (SW II:\n42\u20133). It is thus clear that by \u201ccultivating\ninterest\u201d, Herbart does not mean simply getting the pupil\n\u201cto be interested in something\u201d. Rather, as these four\nphases of interest map onto the phases of engrossment and reflection,\ninterest is an expression of many-sidedness, namely its activity in\nthe world. For \u201cdemand\u201d here is not simply a strong\ndesire, but an apperceptive \u201cmental anticipation\u201d of the\nobject\u2019s realization. As such it is necessary for the pupil to\nadvance to a more perfect state of systematic and aesthetic\ncompleteness.[73]\n Thus by promoting interest and\nmany-sidedness, education primes the pupil for action (PS:\n181).[74]\nThus far, \u201cinterest\u201d has remained quite abstract: it\nis, in nuce, a questing openness towards certain objects,\nleading to action. Now the kind of action Herbart has in mind is not\nan instinctive reaction, but is integrated into a systematic plan. For\nthe totality of \u201cthe interesting\u201d is prescribed by\nculture,[75]\nand its divisions into the cultural and natural sciences (SW II: 44,\nf.).  Education must accordingly pursue in parallel the formation of\nthe pupil\u2019s imagination and understanding (PS I: 59; cf. 181).\nBecause all knowledge is rooted in experience, organized through\nspeculation, and grasped as a whole aesthetically, Bildung\nmust develop these three dimensions equally (SW II: 53). Equally\nimportant, however, is the pupil\u2019s constant, active\nparticipation in his surroundings, in order to develop an empathic\nunderstanding of her fellow human beings (PS I: 156; SW II: 51,\nff.). In all these cases, a teacher is needed to modify experience and\nhuman interaction in order to maximize the yield of knowledge. For\nexperience merely accumulates random representations;\ninstruction helps the person to analyze, organize and combine\nthese \u201cformless fragments\u201d (Weiss 1928:\n 200).[76]\n By the same token,\nmere everyday contact with others does not produce empathy.\nHence, the teacher must not be narrowly committed to his scientific\nexpertise, but demonstrate interest in the world and human beings (SW\nII: 50). While native taste and thoughtfulness cannot be taught, the\nteacher must be alert to these and fan such sparks in order\nto complete what nature has prepared (SW II: 46). Further, he\nmust respect the \u201cpersonal unity\u201d of the child:\nHerbart\u2019s rule:\n\nto give equal right to engrossment and reflection\nin every in area of inquiry, no matter how small; i.e., to tend in\norder to: clarity of the particular; association of\nthe many; coordination of what has been associated, as well\nas practice in progressing through this organization.\n\n In all this, the elements of\ninstruction\u2014\u201cfacts, information, ideas,\nknowledge\u201d\u2014are not negligible, but rather\n\nvitally important, for \u2026 they become built\nup into \u201capperception masses\u201d, which, in the process of\ntaking in more facts, information, ideas, knowledge, give\nrise to \u201capperceptive interest\u201d, this latter being itself\nof first importance in the character-forming process. (Hayward 1907:\n70)\n5.2 Character\nWe have so far been discussing the ideal of the many-sidedness; the\nmany-sided person and the person of character is one and the same,\nthough regarded from different perspectives (PS I: 199; SW II: 89; cf.\nSW IV, esp. \u201cP\u00e4dagogisches Gutachten usw.\u201d:\n519, ff). Herbart is particularly concerned with moral\ncharacter, and its virtues of stability, hardness\n(H\u00e4rte), and invulnerability. He wants to show that a\nmany-sided interest serves moral character, and how pedagogy devoted\nto the former contributes to moral education (Weiss 1928: 211). For\nHerbart, (moral) character, like all spiritual (geistig)\naspects of human life, is not a natural given, but a gradual\nacquisition. Psychologically speaking, it is the will that in the\nyoung child is stamped through repeated interaction with the outer\nworld, settling into \u201cuniform and stable [ways] in which [it\npursues] certain goals while excluding others\u201d; thus, the will\nbecomes character (Weiss 1928: 211; cf. SW II: 90).\nCharacter has distinct objective and subjective sides (SW II:\n90\u20131).  Objectively, character depends on the child\u2019s\nsusceptibility to formation and its individuality. Although the child\nis not born with \u201ca\u201d character (which term is reserved for\nsettled traits), yet he is born with certain dispositions, including a\n\u201cdisposition to stability of character\u201d (SW II: 91). This\nmanifests itself in what Herbart calls the will\u2019s\n\u201cmemory\u201d, i.e., the fact that under like stimuli, the will\nwill will like actions (SW II: 91\u20132). In this respect, there\nseems to be something predictable, hence \u201cobjective\u201d in\nhuman character. Although this stability is but relative, and one\nspontaneously finds himself choosing or forsaking, avoiding this or\npursuing that, yet\n\n\nwhere there is a memory of the will, the choice [in a given situation]\nwill be made of itself. The preponderance of wishes will involuntarily\norganize itself [and manifests itself in] choice. (SW II: 92; SW\nV: 203)\nIn different individuals, their inclinations and naturally\ndiffering intensity will cause the stability of simple willing to\nvary: \u201cevery individuality is and remains a chameleon\u201d (SW\nII: 93). Nonetheless, they originate in a \u201cunified source and\npoint of reference\u201d that constitutes the \u201cessential core\nof individuality\u201d (Weiss 1928: 213). Hence while choice only\noccurs in accordance with an individual, particular standard, it\nremains the precondition for the consolidation of character itself. It\nis out of simple willing and the psychological character to which it\ngradually gives rise that the \u201cmatter\u201d is gathered, as it\nwere, with which one has to work, and from which he ultimately\n\u201cmust secure the demands that he makes of himself\u201d:\n\u201cBeing is what gets a person started; demands follow\nafter\u201d (PS I: 198).\nOn the other hand, these demands typify the higher, subjective\naspect of character, \u201chigher\u201d because marked by reflective\nintelligence, an apperceptive distinction between willing and the\nobjects of will, between I and not-I. Thus the ego now identifies the\nnatural or simple will as its \u201cown\u201d will: the natural\nstability of the simple will becomes a willed or conscious stability.\nIn addition, the reflective effort to grasp oneself leads to\na demand regarding the objects towards\nwhich conscious willing is directed. That is, the will must\nadapt itself to changes in the object: it perceives a demand\nthat one must \u201cprecisely orient oneself in view of\ncircumstances\u201d, and to do so differently as circumstances\nshift. Hence the stability of character must be tempered with\nflexibility (Motivit\u00e4t); in the \u201cprecision of this\nflexibility lies the art of characterful living\u201d (PS I:\n201; 351, f.; cf. esp. 198).  Individual willing settles into\ncharacter through the struggle that arises in the individual\u2019s\nattempt to defend the ego and the will\u2019s stability. Because the\nstability of character is only relative, and shifts over the years,\nits true principle can only consist in being oriented towards\na realm of purposes (Zwecke) or ultimate values\n(Werte) (Weiss 1928: 216).\n5.3 Ethical aspect of character\n\nTo bring it about that the pupil finds himself, as\nchoosing the good, as rejecting the evil: this\u2014or\nnothing\u2014is character-formation! (SW I: 261)\n\n Character has an ineluctably ethical aspect: we\nwant (our) character not to be of just any sort, but good. Like\nAristotle, Herbart holds that we always stand in some relation to virtue\nand vice. While not by nature good or bad, our actions and character\nnecessarily fall somewhere on the spectrum of virtue and vice. Virtue\nis thus not something attached from the outside to an ethically\nneutral self; rather, it is a natural quality of man that will develop\nwell or poorly. So Herbart, like Aristotle and Plato, does not think\nthat education should aim to inculcate moral truths or commandments,\nso much as lead the \u201cmoral[ly constituted human being]\nto recognize his own value and dignity, and [then] to elevate\nit\u201d (PS I: 199). Here again we see the transition from the\nobjective facticity of one\u2019s constitution as a being\nwith some moral charge, to the subjective endorsement of it,\nof accepting responsibility for the excellence of one\u2019s moral\nconstitution as the source of one\u2019s value and dignity. It is a\nmovement of \u201cawakening self-reflection\u201d, in which the\nform-law governing our involuntary (aesthetic) approval or disapproval\nof human actions or situations is elevated to norm-law, i.e., is\naccepted as binding on me, and to which I have a responsibility that I\naccept (cf. Weiss 1928: 216).\nAs with character generally, moral character displays a kind of\nnatural memory, a \u201cperduring in simple willing [,] the natural\nbeginning of unity and consistency of moral willing\u201d, already\nevident in the small child\u2019s incipient moral feeling (PS I: 199;\ncf. SW II: 120\u20131). All this points to the fact that in the\nobjective or natural constitution of character, we already find\n\u201cconceptions of the good and right\u201d. This natural moral\nmemory shows itself in the fact that\n\nmoral judgment as the pure natural appearance of\nthe essence of humanity is not \u201cobscure\u201d and\n\u201cmutable\u201d, but [always] \u201cdecisive\u201d, that it\nalways appears as the same willing whenever the same stimulus is\nrenewed and nothing hinders or neutralizes a pure conception of the\nobject, [i.e.,] whenever the mind is in a state of pure\ncontemplation. (Weiss 1928: 217; cf. esp. PS I: 131)\nThis consistent, disinterested willing just is the phenomenon of\nconscience, which thus reveals itself as a form of willing, namely the\nnatural desire for the good as neutrally judged. As will, conscience,\ntoo, has an object, namely the moral ideal, i.e., its own relation to\nother wills. As we saw in our discussion of Herbart\u2019s ethics,\n\n[t]he judged [thing, sc. judged by\n\u201cconscience\u201d] is also [the] will, [only in this case] the\nwill in its relation to other wills (PS I: 202)\n\n Conscience as \u201cnatural\u201d or\n\u201cobjective\u201d will thus articulates the (moral) demands\nthat the human being makes of himself, the pursuit of which\ndetermines his moral character, now properly so\ncalled. Self-reflection at first notices objective as well as\nsubjective willing, but when the object has been completely\nrepresented, viz., the individual will as a member\nor relatum of a will-relation, then this complete\nrepresentation of the object also provokes approval or disapproval as an immediate\n\u201caesthetic\u201d effect . In other\nwords, the individual goes beyond merely registering how he feels or\nfinds himself, to positively approving or censuring that same inner\nstate.\nWe see here a special case of apperception as an interaction among\nconflicting representational masses, in which one representational\ngroup is not only \u201cnoticed\u201d but evaluated by another, held\nto what (from its perspective) is perceived as an alien claim. Now, on\nthe one hand, since the soul is postulated as a unity, the difference\nbetween how one is, and how one judges that one ought to\nbe, indicates an inner conflict. On the other hand, the moral\npersonality, as a manifestation of the integral soul, must or ought\nalso to be integrated. In short, the conflict must be resolved so that\nthe judged will is brought into agreement with the aesthetic\n(apperceiving, evaluating) will, and so \u201cmerge into a single\nperson\u201d: \u201c[T]his person represents the ideal of an\nethically self-determining will\u201d (PS I: 202; cf. 131). But since\nthis ideal is rarely if ever achieved, we constantly feel compelled to\n\u201cinterrupt our activity and alter our mental disposition from\nwithin\u201d. Thus, for the sake of the unity of the moral\npersonality, the human takes as a categorical imperative what\npreviously was but an aesthetic judgment.\nNow it is a presupposition of pedagogy that all human beings are\ncapable of living up to the ideal of an integrated, unified,\nautonomous personality (PS I: 202; 93). But how does the will become\ndecisive? In other words, how do we gain a moral character\nthat acts for the good? We may approach this problem by\nasking how those natures that successfully form themselves do so, and\nthrough what stages they must pass in \u201cgaining a\ncharacter\u201d (Weiss 1928: 221\u20132). This can help the\npedagogue develop a plan for optimizing what is otherwise a haphazard\nprocess. The resolute character depends, first, upon a\nmoral eros, and striving towards a representation. The will\ngenerates the act out of a desire (PS I: 360). But active deeds in\nturn depend on natural disposition\u2014including bodily health; the\nwill\u2019s memory; and the spirit\u2019s mobility or\n\u201cflexibility\u201d (PS I: 365). The less motile the spirit,\nthe firmer the will (PS I: 365;\n198).[77] Now\nnatural disposition develops very slowly and only fully matures in\nadults when they enter the world. Hence character-education has\nlittle latitude, since children rarely are placed in situations of\ntrue responsibility. At just the moment when the young adult takes up\nresponsibilities, his receptivity for education is exhausted (SW II:\n88, f.; PS I: 364).\nHerbart draws two conclusions: First, that character-formation must\nfocus on the young person\u2019s \u201csphere of desire\n[Begehrungskreis]\u201d, as the one aspect of character\napparently susceptible to \u201ca lasting influence\u201d (Weiss\n1928: 224). And since desires aim at goals, and goals are\nrepresentations, the educator can set to work upon the \u201csphere\nof representations\u201d, and thus shape the ultimate targets for the\nmature individual\u2019s future desire (SW II: 118, f.). Second,\nHerbart concludes that character-development gains stability and\nsecurity by being accelerated and integrated into the actual period\nand process of education. The teacher must keep in mind that character\n\u201cis solely formed through action out of one\u2019s own\nwill\u201d (PS I: 251). Therefore, Herbart\u2019s pedagogy\nemphasizes the importance of offering the child\u2019s will ample\nopportunity to express itself: \u201cBoys and youths must\nbe dared to become men\u201d (\u201cMa\u00dfregeln der\nKinderregierung\u201d; Herbart 1887b: 17). It is the work itself\nthat fixes the bounds of thought and action, not the teacher; within\nthose bounds the student is to be given maximal freedom (PS I:\n308). By frequently exercising the freedom of the will in purposeful\nactivity, the pedagogue is able to \u201charden\u201d the\npupil\u2019s will (PS I: 368\u20139).\nWe began by asking how moral character is to be formed. This\nquestion finally calls for consideration of the \u201cinfluences\nthat specially affect the moral features of character\u201d (Weiss\n1928: 225). Chief among these is aesthetic judgment, which must\ntherefore be constantly exercised, so as to become the power\nmastering desires. The pedagogue must therefore carefully attend to\nthe contents of the child\u2019s or sphere of thoughts. First, the\npupil should gain a clear and particularized familiarity with a\n\u201cwhole series of moral elements and their most common causes in\nlife\u201d, e.g., the main relationships of daily life, family,\ncountry, and their various conflicts and contradictions. Further,\nsince character ultimately depends on the integration of the person,\nall domains of human interest must be brought into relation with the\nideal: thus, for Herbart as for\nMontaigne,[78]\n history in the broadest sense provides an\nindispensable space in which to exercise the young person\u2019s\naesthetic and practical judgment. Since passive presentation of\nhistorical, literary, or philosophical pictures must be\navoided, the instructor must strive to bring peoples and persons of\nthe past to the fore as living people: practice in\nrecognizing many human types sharpens the pupil\u2019s\n\u201cethical eye\u201d, securing the child from dangerous\nsurprises in life (SW II: 50). Again, because historical figures\nappear at a distance, the pupil can contemplate them in a\ndisinterested fashion, letting \u201cpure taste\u201d rule action\nin his imagination. Such training is the best one can do in preparing\nthe person for adulthood.",
