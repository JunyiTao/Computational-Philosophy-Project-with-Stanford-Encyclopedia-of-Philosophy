The discussion of\nthe aesthetic values of perspicuity and poignancy harks back to\nPlotinian values of clarity and intensity. But the unusual turn in the\narticle is the connection of the \u201caesthetic attitude\u201d with\nthe philosophical psychology of Brentano:\n\n\nBrentano divided the attitudes of the conscious mind into three basic\nspecies. There was mere conception or presentation, having something\nbefore one or present to one, without taking up any further conscious\nstance towards it; there was the theoretical acceptance of something\nas real, true, existent, believable\u2026 and there was finally the\nother non-theoretical acceptance or rejection which is present in our\nfeelings,\u2026 our desires, and all our practical decisions\u2026\nWe may well doubt whether pure presentation has that priority in\nmental life which Brentano gave to it, whether it is not perhaps\nrightly regarded as a deficient mode of attitudes far more involved\nand existential. However this may be, the value of the scheme is that\nis places the aesthetic field very satisfactorily\u2014the aesthetic\nfield is one of suspended conception, of pure having something before\none to contemplate. It is a field essentially divorced from the\nYes-No of belief and conviction, as it is divorced from the other\nYes-No of practical concern\u2026When we are aesthetically minded we\nare interested in what comes before us purely as an instance of\ncharacter regardless as to whether there really is, or is not, such a\nthing or sort of thing, and our interest is moreover, not concerned,\nas practical interest always is, to bring what is merely thought of or\nintended into the field of reality, or to push something from the\nfield of reality out into the field of the merely thought or intended.\n(1967d [1972: 94])\n\n\nPresentations need not, and sometimes cannot, be sensually filled, so\nthe resulting aesthetics does not emphasize sense perception, allowing\nFindlay to speak comfortably of the beauty of mathematical proofs and\nother abstracta. Likewise, the separation of presentations from\nemotions, Brentano\u2019s \u201cfeelings of love and hate\u201d,\nundercuts expressionistic aesthetic theories, allowing Findlay to\nspeak coherently about severely abstract works of art that neither\nconvey nor provoke emotion.\n\nPresentations, however, can be clear or obscure, and Findlay makes\nclarity a necessary condition of aesthetic quality. (This includes\nbeing clear about obscure things). The poignancy requirement is more\nunusual, and involves what Findlay describes as an\n\u201carrest\u201d in our normally turbulent mental life. Some\nperspicuous presentations bore us, but the poignant ones captivate us:\nwe are rapt, ecstatic, in contemplating them, and our mind does not\nwish to move on to any successive intentional act. Since aesthetic\nappreciation requires such ecstatic arrests, we often suffer\n\u201caesthetic impotence\u201d, returning to an adored object and\nfinding ourselves unmoved by it. Such impotence may involve a past\noverestimation of the value of the object. But more often it involves\nan inability to recover youthful levels of concentration. One might\nconsider that Findlay\u2019s doctrine of \u201carrest\u201d before\nworks of art might explain \u201cmuseum fatigue\u201d, where walking\none hall in a museum can prove as tiring as hiking one mile in the\nwoods.\n",
