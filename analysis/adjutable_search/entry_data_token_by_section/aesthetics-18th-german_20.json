In this regard it is not a critique of\nKantian moral theory but a critique of an aspect of\nKantian aesthetics, namely Kant\u2019s theory of the \u201cideal\nof beauty\u201d in the \u201cAnalytic of the Beautiful\u201d in\nthe Critique of the Power of Judgment. Schiller\u2019s use of the\nexpression \u201cideal of beauty\u201d very early in his essay\nsignals that this is his primary target (\u201cOn Grace and\nDignity,\u201d NA 253; Curran 126).\n\n\nKant introduces the concept of the \u201cideal of beauty\u201d in\nthe third moment of the \u201cAnalytic of the Beautiful,\u201d which\ndiscusses the various relations that obtain between beauty and\npurposiveness. Kant begins the third moment by arguing that in its\npurest form the judgment of taste is a response to the mere appearance\nof the form of purposiveness in an object, as opposed to any actual\npurposiveness, in either of the senses of that concept, namely,\nactually serving some specific purpose or having been designed to\nserve some purpose. Correspondingly, Kant equates pure beauty with the\nmere form or appearance of purposiveness rather than with actual\npurposiveness. However, as we saw in section 7.1, Kant complicates his\nanalysis by recognizing forms of beauty that are not pure but are\nconnected with (although not reducible to) the recognition of actual\npurposiveness. The first of these forms is \u201cadherent\nbeauty,\u201d a beauty of form that is consistent with or appropriate\nfor the actual purpose of an object that clearly has a purpose that\nconstrains its possible form in various ways, such as an arsenal or a\nrace horse. Then Kant comes to the \u201cideal of beauty,\u201d or\n\u201cthe highest model, the archetype of taste\u2026in accordance\nwith which [anyone] must judge everything that is an object of\ntaste,\u201d a representation of an individual object or particular\ntype of object that is maximally beautiful (CPJ, \u00a717,\n5:232).\n\n\nKant signals that the search for an ideal of beauty is not something\ninitiated by the logic of taste as such but by something external to\ntaste, namely, the faculty of reason: the \u201carchetype of\ntaste\u2026rests on reason\u2019s indeterminate idea of a maximum.\u201d\nKant argues that\nthe beauty for which an idea [or ideal] is to be\nsought cannot be a vague beauty, but there must be a\nbeauty fixed by a concept of objective purposiveness,\nconsequently it must not belong to the object of an entirely pure\njudgment of taste, but rather to one of a partly intellectualized\njudgment of taste. (CPJ, \u00a717, 5:232\u20133)\n\n\nThis means that the ideal of beauty is a species\nof adherent rather than free beauty. Kant then argues that there are\ntwo elements in such an ideal, namely a uniquely valuable purpose or\nend and a uniquely appropriate aesthetic expression of this purpose\nor end. \u201cThe human being alone is capable of an ideal\nof beauty,\u201d Kant then argues, because \u201cthe\nhumanity in his person, as intelligence, is alone among all the\nobjects in the world capable of the ideal\nof perfection\u201d (ibid., 5:233).  That is, according to\n(practical) reason the human being is the only thing of unconditional\nvalue. But for this ideal to be an ideal of beauty, the unique moral\nvalue of humanity must find an outward expression which is somehow\nappropriate for it although it is not connected to it in accordance\nwith any rule. This expression is found in the beauty of the\n\u201chuman figure,\u201d which is associated \u201cwith\nthe morally good in the idea of the highest\npurposiveness\u2014goodness of soul, or purity, or strength, or\nrepose, etc.\u201d\u2014not in accordance with any rule but simply\nby \u201cgreat force of the imagination\u201d (ibid., 5:235).\nImagination is in fact doubly involved: first, because there is no\nway to derive what counts as beauty in the human figure from mere\nconcepts or by any mechanical process (that could yield only\n\u201ccorrectness in the presentation of the species\u201d), so the\nideal of maximum beauty can only be created by an act of the\naesthetic imagination; and second, because there is no rule that says\nthat moral value must be expressed in outward appearance or that\noutward appearance can be interpreted as an expression of moral\nvalue, but that association too must be created by the\nimagination.\n\n\nSchiller\u2019s first goal in \u201cOn Grace and Dignity\u201d is to show\nthat Kant\u2019s account of the ideal of beauty is not sufficiently precise\nin its account of what aspects of human beauty can be taken as an\nexpression of the moral condition of a human being. He also contends\nthat Kant\u2019s account does not offer an adequate explanation of why any\nfeatures of the outward appearance should be taken as an expression of\nmoral condition. More specifically, Schiller argues that there are two\ndifferent moral conditions of human beings, grace and dignity, and\nthese naturally find different external expressions in the appearance\nof human beings, and by implication in the artistic representation or\nmimesis of them. As a result, the ideal of beauty is more complicated\nthan Kant recognizes. Moreover, there are good reasons why these moral\nconditions should find external expression, so the connection between\nmoral condition and aesthetic result is much less arbitrary than Kant\nmakes it seem.\n\n\nOn Schiller\u2019s account, Kant\u2019s first mistake is to locate the ideal of\nbeauty vaguely in the human figure rather than specifically\nin the bodily accompaniments of intentional actions that are\nthe products of the human will, which, according to Kant\nhimself, is the primary locus of moral value. This also means that it\nis a mistake for Kant to suggest, if that is what he means, that the\nideal of beauty can be found in a general type of human being rather\nthan in particular human beings, for actions are always done by\nparticular human beings. Kant is of course committed to the general\nthesis that beauty is always a property of a particular, but it might\nbe argued that he has lost sight of that commitment when he locates\nthe ideal of beauty in something as general as \u201cthe human\nfigure\u201d as the expression of human morality. Schiller argues\nthat the \u201carchitectonic beauty of the human form,\u201d that\nis, the fixed configuration of the features of a person\u2019s appearance,\n\u201ccomes directly from nature and is formed by the rule of\nnecessity\u201d (\u201cOn Grace and Dignity,\u201d NA 255; Curran\n127), and thus cannot plausibly be taken as an expression of the moral\ncharacter or condition of a person, which is determined by the\nperson\u2019s will or free choice. Any aspect of beauty that can be\ninterpreted as an expression of moral condition must thus be found in\nthe voluntary actions of particular persons rather than in\ntheir fixed features. More specifically, grace, as a condition in\nwhich a person is not merely committed to doing what morality requires\nas a matter of principle but is also so committed to doing this that\nit has become part of his character and thus seems as much natural as\nvoluntary, is revealed in the motions that accompany a\nperson\u2019s directly willed actions but are not themselves consciously\nwilled (\u201cOn Grace and Dignity,\u201d NA 167; Curran 136). For\nexample,\none can deduce from a person\u2019s words how he\nwould like to be viewed, but what he really is must\nbe guessed from the gestures accompanying the speech, in other words,\nfrom the uncontained movements. (\u201cOn Grace and\nDignity,\u201d NA 268; Curran 137)\n\n\nIt is in the unintentional accompaniments of\nintentional actions that we can discern people\u2019s real commitment to\nwhat they are doing and the ease with which they make that\ncommitment; the latter is grace, and thus the movements that express\nthat are the expression of grace. Grace can be expressed in the\n\u201crigid and restful features\u201d of an individual\u2019s\nphysiognomy only insofar as those features themselves \u201cwere\noriginally nothing other than movements that through frequent\nrepetition became habitual and left lasting traces\u201d (\u201cOn\nGrace and Dignity,\u201d NA 264; Curran 134).\n\n\nThe next part of Schiller\u2019s aesthetic argument against Kant is that\ndignity is a different moral condition than grace, and that it\ntherefore naturally finds a different outward expression. While grace\nis the expression of a condition in which there is no tension between\na person\u2019s moral commitments and his desires, and where there is thus\nharmony between the explicitly willed aspects of his intentional\nmotions and the instinctive aspects of them, dignity is the sensible\nexpression of successfully willing to act in accordance with moral\nprinciples even at the cost of the suppression of conflicting desires\nand feelings, and is therefore manifest in quite different aspects of\nappearance than grace is. In a person expressing dignity rather than\ngrace,\nwhile his veins swell, his muscles become cramped\nand taut, his voice cracks, his chest is thrust out, and his lower\nbody pressed in, his intentional movements are gentle, the facial\nfeatures relaxed, and the eyes and brow serene\u2026.this\ncontradiction of signs demonstrates the existence and influence of a\npower independent of suffering and above the impressions to which we\nsee the sensuous succumb. And in this way, peace in\nsuffering, in which dignity actually consists, becomes the\nrepresentation of intelligence in human beings and the expression\ntheir moral freedom. (\u201cOn Grace and Dignity,\u201d; NA\n295\u20136; Curran 159\u201360)\n\n\nAs Schiller sums up, \u201cGrace, then, lies in\nthe freedom of intentional movements, dignity in\nthe mastery of instinctive ones\u201d (\u201cOn Grace and\nDignity,\u201d NA 297; Curran 160). Grace expresses a tendency to\nact as morality requires that has become instinctive, while dignity\nexpresses mastery grounded on moral principles over instincts that\nare not harmonious with morality. These are two different moral\nconditions, and thus find two different forms of visible\nexpression.\n\n\nAlthough Schiller\u2019s illustration of both grace and dignity refer to\nour perceptions of actual human beings rather than to artistic\nrepresentations of them, that is not an objection to reading his\naccount as a critique of Kant\u2019s conception of the ideal of beauty. In\nthe \u201cAnalytic of the Beautiful\u201d Kant himself is talking\nprimarily about the beauty of nature rather than art, and in the\nsection on the ideal of beauty he is clearly talking about a special\nfeature of human beauty itself rather than of the artistic\nrepresentation of human beauty. Any implications of either Kant\u2019s\naccount or of Schiller\u2019s critique of it for the case of artistic\nrepresentation would have to be inferred. But of course many of the\nfeatures in which Schiller locates both grace and dignity could be\nrepresented in artistic depictions of human beings, and that is why it\nis not implausible to suggest that his account may be directed against\nLessing as well as Kant. Schiller\u2019s contrast between swelling veins,\ncramped muscles, and outhrust chest on the one hand and serenity of\neye and brow on the other could be taken as a plausible description of\nthe famous statue of Laoco\u00f6n, and thus Schiller could be read as\nsuggesting, in the spirit of Winckelmann, that the statue should be\nunderstood as an expression of dignity in the face of suffering rather\nthan as a symbol for the differences between pictorial and verbal\ndepiction.  On Schiller\u2019s account, however, the dignity of the\nunnamed Laoco\u00f6n would be explained by the moral character of the\nindividual, not by the circumstances of a whole people.\n\n\nAs earlier mentioned, \u201cOn Grace and Dignity\u201d has\ntraditionally been read as a critique of Kant\u2019s moral theory rather\nthan of his aesthetics, arguing for greater moral significance for\nfeelings in line with our principled commitment to morality than Kant\nacknowledges. It looks as if Schiller holds that the ideal for moral\nconduct is that complete attunement between the determination of the\nwill by moral principles and our natural and instinctive desires and\ninclinations that is expressed in grace. Further, it seems that this\nis only because he recognizes that such attunement will not always be\npossible for human beings that he admits that there is sometimes a\nneed for that mastery over refractory feelings that expresses itself\nin dignity\u2014but only as a fall-back or second-best state of\ncharacter, rather than, as Kant seems to suppose, the norm for the\nhuman moral condition. \n\n\nThis is a misreading of the positions of both Schiller and Kant,\nhowever. For Schiller, that complete attunement of principle and\nfeeling that expresses itself in grace is indeed an imperative, but\nan aesthetic demand rather than a strictly moral\ndemand. Thus Schiller writes, Human beings, as\nappearance, are also an object of the senses. Where the moral\nfeeling finds satisfaction, the aesthetic feeling does not\nwish to be reduced, and the correspondence with an idea may not\nsacrifice any of the appearance. Thus, however rigorously reason\ndemands an ethical expression, the eye demands beauty just as\npersistently\u2026.both these demands are made of the same object,\nalthough they come from different courts of judgment. (\u201cOn Grace\nand Dignity,\u201d NA 277; Curran 144\u20135)\n\n\nBut as far as morality alone is concerned, the\nmastery of will over inclination that is expressed in dignity is all\nthat is required. For Kant, however, morality itself demands\na complete harmony between principle and inclination, because any\ntension between them is a sign that one\u2019s commitment to the principle\nof morality is not yet complete, one\u2019s good will or virtue not yet\nperfected. The self-mastery that is expressed in dignity may often be\nall that human beings can achieve under natural circumstances, and it\ncertainly satisfies the demand for legality in our actions;\nbut as Kant sees it morality requires that perfection of\nvirtue or of the good will that he calls holiness (see Kant\u2019s\nresponse to Schiller in a note added to the second edition of\nKant\u2019s Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason,\n6:23\u20134n.). Thus Kant\u2019s conception of morality actually demands\na greater attunement of principles and feelings than does\nSchiller\u2019s\u2014although Schiller\u2019s might be the more plausible\naccount of morality, that is, one that better accommodates the\nreality of the human condition, precisely for that reason.  Indeed,\nKant may have been carried away by the polemic with Schiller, because\nelsewhere his position is not that human beings must aim at holiness,\nbut only at virtue, not at the elimination of all inclinations\ncontrary to morality but at the strength of will to overcome\nthem.\n",
