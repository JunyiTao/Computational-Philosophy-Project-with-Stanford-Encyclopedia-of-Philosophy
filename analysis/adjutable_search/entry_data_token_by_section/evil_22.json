    "main_text": "Theodicies || The Need for Natural Laws\n7.4 The Need for Natural Laws\nA final important theodicy involves the following ideas: first, it\nis important that events in the world take place in a regular way,\nsince otherwise effective action would be impossible; secondly, events\nwill exhibit regular patterns only if they are governed by natural\nlaws; thirdly, if events are governed by natural laws, the operation\nof those laws will give rise to events that harm individuals; so,\nfourthly, God\u2019s allowing natural evils is justified because the\nexistence of natural evils is entailed by natural laws, and a world\nwithout natural laws would be a much worse world.\nThis type of theodicy is also exposed to serious objections. First\nof all, the occasional occurrence of miraculous intervention,\nincluding events that clearly appeared contrary to natural laws, would\nnot render effective human action impossible, since humans would see\nthat such miraculous occurrences were extremely rare.\nSecondly, and relatedly, consider a world where the laws of\nphysics, rather than being laws that admit of no exceptions, are\ninstead probabilistic laws. Effective human action would still be\npossible in such a world, provided that the relevant probabilities\nwere sufficiently high. But if so, then effective human action would\nbe no less possible in a world with non-statistical laws where there\nwere occasional miraculous interventions.\nThirdly, many of the greatest evils could have been prevented by\nmiraculous interventions that would not have been detected. Consider,\nfor example, interventions to prevent natural disasters such as\nvolcanic eruptions, or earthquakes, including the earthquake in China\nin 1556 that killed around 800,000 people, or tsunamis, such as the\none in 2004 that hit 12 Asian countries, and killed over 200,000\npeople. Or consider the interventions that would be needed to prevent\npandemics, such as the Black Death in the Middle Ages, which is\nestimated to have killed between 75 million and 200 million people, or\nthe 1918 flu pandemic, which killed between 50 million and 100 million\npeople.  Similarly, consider great moral evils, such as the\nHolocaust. A small intervention by an omnipotent, omniscient, and\nperfectly good being could have allowed one of the many failed attempts\nto assassinate Hitler to succeed, or a small mental nudge could have\nresulted in Hitler\u2019s realizing the error in his virulent\nanti-Semitism.\nFourthly, what natural evils a world contains depends not just on\nthe laws, but also on the initial, or boundary conditions. Thus, for\nexample, an omnipotent being could create ex nihilo a world\nwhich had the same laws of nature as our world, and which contained\nhuman beings, but which was devoid of non-human carnivores. Or the\nworld could be such that there was unlimited room for populations to\nexpand, and ample natural resources to support such populations.\nFifthly, many evils depend upon precisely what laws the world\ncontains. An omnipotent being could, for example, easily create a\nworld with the same laws of physics as our world, but with slightly\ndifferent laws linking neurophysiological states with qualities of\nexperiences, so that extremely intense pains either did not arise, or\ncould be turned off by the sufferer when they served no purpose. Or\nadditional physical laws of a rather specialized sort could be\nintroduced that would either cause very harmful viruses to\nself-destruct, or prevent a virus such as the avian flu virus from\nevolving into an air-born form that has the capacity to kill hundreds\nof million people.\nFinally, this theodicy provides no account of moral evil. If other\ntheodicies could provide a justification for God\u2019s allowing moral\nevil, then, of course, moral evil would not be a problem. But, as we\nhave seen, no satisfactory justification appears to be available.\n\n",
