    "main_text": "Diagrams as Representational Systems || Euler Diagrams\n2.1 Euler Diagrams\n\nLeonhard Euler, an 18th century mathematician, adopted closed curves\nto illustrate syllogistic reasoning (Euler\n 1768).\n The four kinds of categorical sentences are represented by him as\nshown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Euler Diagrams\n\n\nFor the two universal statements, the system adopts spatial relations\namong circles in an intuitive way: If the circle labelled\n\u2018A\u2019 is included in the circle labelled\n\u2018B,\u2019 then the diagram represents the information\nthat all A is B. If there is no overlapping\npart between two circles, then the diagram conveys the information\nthat no A is B.\n\nThis representation is governed by the following\n convention:[3]\n\nEvery object x in the domain is assigned a unique location,\nsay l(x), in the plane such that\nl(x) is in region R if and only if\nx is a member of the set that the region R\nrepresents.\n\n\nThe power of this representation lies in the fact that an object being\na member of a set is easily conceptualized as the object falling\ninside the set, just as locations on the page are thought of as\nfalling inside or outside drawn circles. The system\u2019s power also\nlies in the fact that no additional conventions are needed to\nestablish the meanings of diagrams involving more than one circle:\nrelationships holding among sets are asserted by means of the same\nrelationships holding among the circles representing them. The\nrepresentations of the two universal statements, \u2018All\nAare B\u2019 and \u2018No A is\nB,\u2019 illustrate this strength of the system.\n\nMoving on to two existential statements, this clarity is not\npreserved. Euler justifies the diagram of \u201cSome A is\nB\u201d saying that we can infer visually that\nsomething in A is also contained in B since part of\narea A is contained in area B (Euler 1768: 233).\nObviously, Euler himself believed that the same kind of visual\ncontainment relation among areas can be used in this case as well as\nin the case of universal statements. However, Euler\u2019s belief is\nnot correct and this representation raises a damaging ambiguity. In\nthis diagram, not only is part of circle A contained in area\nB (as Euler describes), but the following are true: (i) part\nof circle B is contained in area A (ii) part of\ncircle A is not contained in circle B (iii) part of\ncircle B is not contained in circle A. That is, the\nthird diagram could be read off as \u201cSome B is\nA,\u201d \u201cSome A is not B,\u201d\nand \u201cSome B is not A\u201d as well as\n\u201cSome A is B.\u201d In order to avoid this\nambiguity, we need to set up several more\n conventions.[4]\n\nEuler\u2019s own examples nicely illustrate the strengths and\nweaknesses of his diagrammatic system.\n\nExample 1. All A are B. All\nC are A. Therefore, all C are B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2. No A is B. All\nC are B. Therefore, no C is A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both examples, the reader can easily infer the conclusion, and this\nillustrates visually powerful features of Euler diagrams. However,\nwhen existential statements are represented, things become more\ncomplicated, as explained above. For instance:\n\n\nExample 3. No A is B. Some\nC is A. Therefore, Some C is not\nB.\n\nNo single diagram can represent the two premises, since the\nrelationship between sets B and C cannot be fully\nspecified in one single diagram. Instead, Euler suggests the following\nthree possible cases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuler claims that the proposition \u2018Some C is not\nB\u2019 can be read off from all these diagrams. However, it\nis far from being visually clear how the first two cases lead a user\nto reading off this proposition, since a user might read off \u201cNo\nC is B\u201d from case 1 and \u201cAll B\nis C\u201d from case 2.\n\nHence, the representation of existential statements not only obscures\nthe visual clarity of Euler Circles but also raises serious\ninterpretational problems for the system. Euler himself seemed to\nrecognize this potential problem and introduced a new syntactic\ndevice, \u2018*\u2019 (representing non-emptiness) as an attempt to\nrepair this flaw (1768: Letter 105).\n\nHowever, a more serious drawback is found when this system fails to\nrepresent certain compatible (that is, consistent) pieces of\ninformation in a single diagram. For example, Euler\u2019s system\nprevents us from drawing a single diagram representing the following\npairs of statements: (i) \u201cAll A are B\u201d\nand \u201cNo A is B\u201d (which are consistent if\nA is an empty set). (ii) \u201cAll A are\nB\u201d and \u201cAll B are A\u201d\n(which are consistent when A = B). (iii) \u201cSome\nA is B\u201d and \u201cAll A are\nB\u201d. (Suppose we drew an Euler diagram for the former\nproposition and try to add a new compatible piece of information,\ni.e., the latter, to this existing diagram.) This shortcoming is\nclosely related to Venn\u2019s motivation for his own diagrammatic\nsystem (see\n Section 3.1\n for other shortcomings of Euler\u2019s system).\n",
