    "main_text": "The Liberty Principle\n3. The Liberty Principle\n\nThe PJP only explains how to justify coercion (or some related form of\ndemand). It includes no other moral principle that describes why\ncoercion is problematic. Nor does it explain how to handle unjustified\ncoercion. So, one might combine the PJP with a consequentialist norm.\nUnjustified coercion, on this view, merits minimization. Or we could\nadopt a deontological side constraint on using unjustified coercion.\nAgain, on this matter, the PJP is silent.\n\nAnd yet, many public justification theorists, with other liberals,\nadopt such a principle. Some theorists call it the Liberty Principle.\nIt takes the form of a presumption in favor of liberty or against\ncoercion. Stanley Benn (1988, 87) defends such a presumption. Benn:\n\u201cthe burden of justification falls on the interferer, not on the\nperson interfered with.\u201d\n\nJoel Feinberg (1987, 9) also defends a \u201cpresumption in favor of\nliberty.\u201d Defined: \u201cliberty should be the norm, coercion\nalways needs some special justification.\u201d While Benn worries\nabout interference, and Feinberg about coercion, their presumptions\nare similar. Rawls (2001, 44) endorses a presumption against legal\ncoercion, which also appears in his liberal principle of legitimacy.\nRawls: \u201cOur exercise of political power is proper only when we\nsincerely believe that the reasons we offer for our political action\nmay reasonably be accepted by other citizens as a justification of\nthose actions\u201d (Rawls 2005, xlvi). Rawls does not speak of\ncoercion in this formulation. Yet he elsewhere claims that\n\u201cpolitical power is always coercive power\u201d (68). Further,\npublic justification should explain when citizens may coerce another\n(217). We can naturally read Rawls, then, as endorsing the Liberty\nPrinciple. Gaus (2011) probably provides the most extensive defense of\nthe liberty principle to date (though see Vallier 2019).\n\nWe can conjoin the PJP with the Liberty Principle. Together, they\nexplain how to use the PJP to evaluate laws. When satisfied, the PJP\nlegitimizes coercion, overcoming the presumption in favor of\nliberty.\n",
