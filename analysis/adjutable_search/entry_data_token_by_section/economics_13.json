But nowadays\nthe standard intellectual tool or form in economics is a\n\u201cmodel.\u201d Econometricians speak of models and structures.\nEconomists are more comfortable describing the axioms concerning\nrational choice as constituting a model of rational choice than as\ndelineating a theory of rational choice. Many of the most\ndistinguished commentators on models regard them as fictional worlds,\nwhose study informs our understanding of actual phenomena (Frigg,\n2010). \u201cCreating models is \u2018world-making.\u2019\u201d\n(Morgan 2012, pp. 95, 405). In their view, economists are able to\ninvestigate how causal factors would operate in the absence of\ninterferences by constructing models \u2014that is fictional\neconomies\u2014in which the interferences are absent. Uskali\nM\u00e4ki maintains that \u201cModels are experiments. Experiments\nare models.\u201d (2005). Dani Rodrik (2015) argues that economics\nconsists of a collection of models, and that doing economics consists in\nselecting or customizing a model from this collection. Is the ubiquity\nof talk of models just a change in terminological fashion, or does the\nconcern with models (which is by no means unique to economics) signal\na methodological shift? What are models? These questions have been\ndiscussed by Cartwright 1989, 1999, Godfrey Smith 2006,\nGr\u00fcne-Yanoff 2009, Hausman 1992, 2015a, Kuorikoski and Lehtinen\n2009, M\u00e4ki, ed. 1991, M\u00e4ki 2005, 2009a, 2009b, Morgan 2001,\n2004, 2012, Morgan and Morrison 1999, Rappaport 1998, Sugden 2000,\n2009, Weisberg 2007, and Lehtinen, Kuorikoski and Ylikoski 2012.\n\nThe view of models to which economists are most attracted is\nphilosophically problematic, because it is apparently committed to the\nexistence of fictional entities whose properties and causal\npropensities economists can investigate. In experiments, whether\ncarried out in a laboratory or in the field, experimenters interact\ncausally with flesh and blood experimental subjects, and the outcome\nmay contradict the economist\u2019s predictions. In investigating a\nmodel, in contrast, the economist \u201cinteracts\u201d with\nfictional entities, which are arguably nothing other than his or her\nown thoughts, and the logical implications of the axioms that define\nthe model are never disappointed. This is not to say that the logical\ninvestigation of models never results in surprises. Humans are not\nlogically omniscient, and discovering the implications of a set of\naxioms may be an arduous task. But it is a different task than\ncarrying out an experiment in the laboratory or the field, and\nontology of the \u201cworlds\u201d that economists allegedly\n\u201ccreate\u201d and then study is deeply puzzling. Although less\nfaithful to economic practice, it is far more intelligible\nphilosophically to regard models as predicates or as definitions of\npredicates (Hausman 1992). For example, when economists write down\na model of a firm with a single output and just two inputs,\nthey are defining a concept that they can use to describe\nactual firms.\n",
