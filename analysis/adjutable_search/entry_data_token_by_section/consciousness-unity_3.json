    "main_text": "Characterizations and Taxonomies || Other Forms of Mental Unity\n2.3 Other Forms of Mental Unity\n\nWe will close this section by noting that the forms of unified\nconsciousness distinguished above are not the only kinds of mental\nunity. Earlier we mentioned Gestalt unity. There is also\nunity in the exercise of our cognitive capacities, unity that consists\nof integration of motivating factors, perceptions, beliefs, etc., and\nthere is unity in the outputs, unity that consists of integration of\nbehaviour. \n\nHuman beings bring a strikingly wide range of factors to bear on a\ncognitive task such as seeking to characterize something or trying to\nreach a decision about what to do about something. For example, we can\nbring to bear: what we want; what we believe; our attitudes to self,\nsituation, and context; input from each of our various senses;\ninformation about the situation, other people, others\u2019 beliefs,\ndesires, attitudes, etc.; the resources of however many languages we\nhave available to us; various kinds of memory; bodily sensations;\ndiverse problem-solving skills; and so on. Not only can we bring all\nthese elements to bear, we can integrate them in a way that is highly\nstructured and ingeniously appropriate to our goals and the\nsituation(s) before us. This form of mental unity could appropriately\nbe called unity of cognition.\n\nIt is plausible to hold that unity of cognition is required for unity\nof focal attention. However, there is at least some measure of unified\ncognition in many situations of which we are not conscious, as is\nattested by our ability to balance, control our posture, maneuver\naround obstacles while our consciousness is entirely absorbed with\nsomething else, and so on.\n\nAt the other end of the cognitive process, we find an equally\ninteresting form of unity, what we might call unity of\nbehaviour: our ability to coordinate our limbs, eyes, bodily\nattitude, etc. The precision and complexity of the behavioural\ncoordination we can achieve would be difficult to exaggerate. Think of\na concert pianist performing a complicated work. However, this\ncapacity to unify behaviour, though doubtless a product of unified\nconsciousness, does not figure in what unified consciousness is.\n",
