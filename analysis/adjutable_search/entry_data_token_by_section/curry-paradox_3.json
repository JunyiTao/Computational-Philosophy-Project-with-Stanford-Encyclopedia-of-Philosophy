Constructing Curry Sentences\n\nAs it is standardly presented today, Curry\u2019s paradox afflicts\n\u201cnaive\u201d truth theories (those featuring a\n\u201ctransparent\u201d truth predicate) and \u201cnaive\u201d set\ntheories (those featuring unrestricted set abstraction). This section\nwill explain how each kind of theory can give rise to Curry sentences.\nWe start, however, with a version that concerns theories of\n properties, a version that more closely resembles\nCurry\u2019s formulation. (The supplementary document\n Curry on Curry\u2019s Paradox\n briefly characterizes the targets of Curry\u2019s own versions of\nthe paradox.)\n\nA theory of properties features unrestricted property\nabstraction provided that for any condition statable in the\nlanguage of the theory, there exists a property that (according to the\ntheory) is exemplified by precisely the things that meet this\ncondition. Consider a theory \\(\\mathcal{T_P}\\) formulated in a\nlanguage with a property abstraction device \\([x: \\phi x]\\) and an\nexemplification relation \\(\\epsilon\\). For example, if \\(\\phi(t)\\)\nsays that the object which the term \\(t\\) stands for is triangular,\n\\(t \\ \\epsilon \\ [x: \\phi x]\\) says that this object exemplifies the\nproperty of triangularity. Then, given unrestricted property\nabstraction, we should have the following principle.\n\n\n(Property) For every open sentence \\(\\phi\\) with one\nfree variable, and every term \\(t\\), the sentences \\(t \\ \\epsilon \\\n[x: \\phi x]\\) and \\(\\phi t\\) are intersubstitutable according to\n\\(\\mathcal{T_P}\\).\n\n\nIn effect, Curry (1942b) sketches two\n\u201cmethods of constructing\u201d Curry sentences using his\ncounterpart of (Property). He says that the first is \u201cbased on\nthe Russell paradox\u201d, while the second is \u201cbased on the\nEpimenides paradox\u201d. Although both methods are\nproperty-theoretic, the first method yields a precursor of\nset-theoretic versions of Curry\u2019s paradox, while the second\nyields a precursor of truth-theoretic versions.\n",
