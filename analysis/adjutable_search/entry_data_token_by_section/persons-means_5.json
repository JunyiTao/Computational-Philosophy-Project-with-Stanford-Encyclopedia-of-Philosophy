    "main_text": "Sufficient Conditions for Using Others Merely as Means || Actual Consent\n3.3 Actual Consent\n\nA proposal for a sufficient condition for treating another merely as a\nmeans might invoke a notion of actual consent. Suppose an agent is\nusing another, the proposal might go; he is using her merely as a\nmeans if she has not consented to his use of her (Nozick 1974:\n30\u201331; Scanlon 2008: 107). A more detailed actual consent\nproposal is the following: \u201cAn agent uses another person merely\nas a means if and only if (1) the agent uses another person as a means\nin the service of realizing her ends (2) without, as a matter of moral\nprinciple, making this use conditional on the other\u2019s consent;\nwhere (3) by \u2018consent\u2019 is meant the other\u2019s genuine\nactual consent to being used, in a particular manner, as a means to\nthe agent\u2019s end\u201d (Kleingeld 2020: 398). Both proposals\nface challenges. For example, suppose a patient arrives in the\nemergency room unconscious, with severe injuries. The physician on\nduty judges that only an experimental treatment could preserve the\npatient\u2019s life. She therefore uses the patient in a study of a\nnew technique to prevent blood loss. Both actual consent proposals\nimply, seemingly implausibly, that the physician used the patient\nmerely as a means.\n\nOne might claim that an agent who uses another without the\nother\u2019s actual consent treats him merely as a means unless\nparticular conditions obtain: the agent lacks competency to consent,\nthe other is rationally required to consent (e.g., perhaps to preserve\nhis life), or the agent is rationally forbidden to consent (e.g.,\nperhaps to being someone\u2019s slave) (Formosa 2017: 99\u2013100). This\nproposal would avoid the implication that the physician in the\npreceding example is using the patient merely as a means; for the\npatient obviously lacks competency to consent. Yet the proposal seems\nto suffer from a shortcoming that all the actual consent accounts\nmentioned have. They all seem to imply, implausibly, that an agent\nwould be treating another merely as a means in cases such as this\n(Cohen 1995: 243): Someone uses another without the other\u2019s\nconsent to prevent the light from shining in her eyes, by positioning\nherself in an appropriate way.\n3.4 Invoking Moral Notions (or Not)\n\nA distinction worth noting in accounts of using others merely as means\nis that between ones that do and ones that do not appeal to moral\nconcepts. A clear example of the former type of account is the\nfollowing: X uses Y merely as a means if and only if (1) X uses Y as a\nmeans and (2) X\u2019s use of Y violates a duty that X owes to Y\n(Fahmy 2023: 58). To determine whether an agent uses another merely as\na means on this account, it is obviously necessary to rely on views\nregarding which duties the agent owes to the other. Not surprisingly,\nphilosophers who offer such accounts sometimes invoke Kant\u2019s\nnotion that persons have dignity that demands respect as a basis for\ndetermining our moral duties (2023: 50) (Formosa 2017: 108). A worry\nconcerning these accounts is that the light they shed on what treating\nothers merely as means amounts to is limited by the clarity, or lack\nthereof, in the moral notions they invoke.\n\nOther philosophers suggest sufficient conditions for a person treating\nanother merely as a means that seem not to depend on any moral\nconcepts (Kerstein 2013: 76) (Audi 2016: 4, 56\u201357). It is often easier\nto discern the implications, both plausible and implausible, of these\naccounts than the implications of accounts that rely on disputed or\nvague moral concepts such as our dignity or rights as persons. Of\ncourse, not only accounts of when agents treat others merely as means,\nbut also accounts of when they do not do so (Section 5) differ in\nwhether they are grounded in moral concepts.\n",
