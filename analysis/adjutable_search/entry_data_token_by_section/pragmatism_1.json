    "main_text": "The Pragmatic Maxim: Peirce\n2. The Pragmatic Maxim: Peirce\n\nPeirce made this canonical statement of his Pragmatic Maxim in\n\u2018How to Make our Ideas Clear\u2019:\n\nConsider what effects, which might conceivably have practical\nbearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our\nconception of those effects is the whole of our conception of the\nobject. (EP1: 132)\n\n\nThis offers a distinctive method for becoming clear about the meaning\nof concepts and the hypotheses which contain them. We clarify a\nhypothesis by identifying the practical consequences we should expect\nif it is true. This raises some questions. First: what, exactly is the\ncontent of this maxim? What sort of thing does it recognize as a\npractical consequence? Second, what use does such a maxim have?\nPeirce\u2019s first simple illustrative example urges that what we\nmean by calling something hard is that \u2018it will not be\nscratched by many other substances.\u2019 In this way, then, I can\nuse the concept hard in certain contexts when I am wondering\nwhat to do, and absent such contexts, the concept is empty. The\nprinciple has something of a verificationist character: \u2018our\nidea of anything is our idea of its sensible effects\u2019\n(EP1: 132). However the use of the phrase \u2018practical\nconsequences\u2019 suggests that these are to be understood as having\nimplications for what we will or should do. This is clear\nfrom Peirce\u2019s later formulations, for example:\n\nThe entire intellectual purport of any symbol consists in the total of\nall general modes of rational conduct which, conditionally upon all\nthe possible different circumstances and desires, would ensue upon the\nacceptance of the symbol. (EP2: 346).\n\n\nSo, for instance, if I want to break a window by throwing something\nthrough it, then I need an object which is hard, not soft. It is\nimportant that, as Peirce hints here, the consequences we are\nconcerned with are general and intelligible: we are to look\nfor laws that govern the behaviour of hard things and show how such\nmodes of behaviour can make a difference to what is rational for us to\ndo.\n\nJames never worked out his understanding of \u2018practical\nconsequences\u2019 as fully as Peirce did, and he does not share\nPeirce\u2019s restriction of these consequences to general patterns\nof behaviour. Sometimes he writes as if the practical consequences of\na proposition can simply be effects upon the individual believer: if\nreligious belief makes me feel better, then that contributes to the\npragmatic clarification of \u2018God exists\u2019. James also hopes\nthat the attempt to clarify metaphysical hypotheses will reveal that\nsome propositions are empty or, more important, that, as in the\nsquirrel example, some apparent disagreements are unreal. Peirce sees\nuses for his maxim beyond those James had in mind. He insisted that it\nwas a logical principle, in a broad sense of logic which\nincludes scientific methodology. So for instance he used it to clarify\nconcepts central to scientific reasoning such as probability,\ntruth, and reality. (We shall discuss his views on\ntruth and reality further below.) Pragmatism, described by Peirce as a\n\u2018laboratory philosophy\u2019, shows us how we test theories by\ncarrying out experiments in the expectation that if the hypothesis is\nnot true, then the experiment will fail to have some predetermined\nsensible effect.\n\nPeirce\u2019s description of his maxim as a logical principle is\nreflected in passages where he presents it as a development of a\ndistinction that had been a staple of traditional logic texts, and\nfamiliar to readers of Descartes, between ideas that are\nclear and distinct (EP1: 126f). Peirce understood\nthe first grade of clarity about the meaning of a concept as being\nable to identify instances of it, without necessarily being able to\nsay how. He then took his philosophical contemporaries to hold that\nthe highest grade of clarity, distinctness, is obtained when we can\nanalyze a concept into its elements by providing a verbal definition\n(or, in more recent terminology, necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor its application). Peirce complained that \u2018nothing new is\never learned by analyzing definitions\u2019, unless we already have a\nclear understanding of the defining terms. He therefore announced that\nthe Pragmatic Maxim enabled a higher (\u2018third\u2019) grade of\nclarity, that supplemented the verbal definition with a description of\nhow the concept is employed in practice. \n\nAs well as treating the Pragmatic Maxim as part of a constructive\naccount of the norms that govern inquiry, Peirce, like James, gave it\na negative role as a tool for demonstrating the emptiness of a\npriori metaphysics. In section 3.1 we shall see how pragmatic\nclarification of reality may be used to undermine a flawed\n\u2018nominalistic\u2019 conception of reality that led to the\n\u2018copy theory of truth\u2019, problematic Cartesian\ncertainty-seeking strategies in epistemology, and Kant\u2019s concept\nof a \u2018thing in itself\u2019. A more vivid non-logical example\nof using the maxim to undermine spurious metaphysical ideas was\nPeirce\u2019s early argument that the Catholic understanding of\ntransubstantiation was empty and incoherent. Since all we mean by\nwine is something that has certain distinctive effects upon\nthe senses, \u2018to talk of something as having all the sensible\ncharacters of wine, yet being in reality blood, is senseless\njargon\u2019 (EP1: 131f). It is important to note, however, that the\nmaxim is in the end only a tool for clarifying meaning; not\nPeirce\u2019s theory of meaning proper. This is to be found in his\ntheory of signs or semiotic, which is discussed below (4.4).\n\n",
