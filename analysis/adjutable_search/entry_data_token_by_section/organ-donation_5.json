    "main_text": "Organ Retrieval from Living Donors || Valid Consent\n2.2 Valid Consent\n\nAssuming consent is ethically necessary before taking organs from\nliving competent people, questions arise about what makes consent\nvalid. The usual answer in medical ethics is that consent must be free\n(voluntary), sufficiently informed, and made by someone with the\ncapacity (competence) to consent. Thus, in the context of living\ndonation, people must know what living donation involves, including\nthe risks to them and the chances of success for the recipient, they\nmust be able to decide freely whether to donate, and they must be\ncompetent to do so. (See the entry on\n informed consent.)\n\nCan people freely give consent when considering whether to donate to a\nclose relative? It may be thought that consent in such a case is\nsuspect because potential donors would be: (1) desperate to save their\nrelatives (2) subject to a feeling of moral obligation or (3) subject\nto family pressure. The first two reasons are not good ones. People\ngive valid consent in other desperate circumstances, for instance to a\nlifesaving operation, and acting out of a reasonable sense of moral\nobligation is a way of exercising one\u2019s freedom rather than a\nconstraint upon it (we consider below unusual senses of obligation in\nthe context of religious stranger donation) (Radcliffe-Richards 2006;\nT.M. Wilkinson and Moore 1997).\n\nFamily pressure is different. Family pressure may take the form of\ncredible threats of violence, in which case the potential donor is\ncoerced and any consent invalid. Family pressure may be felt as a form\nof moral obligation on the part of the donor, in which case (see\nabove) consent would not be made invalid for that reason. Somewhat\nharder to think through is family pressure that consists of the\nimplicit threat of ostracism. On the one hand, that pressure may be\nvery effective. On the other, it works by family members withdrawing\ntheir goodwill, something people are generally entitled to do. Some\nviews of coercion and valid consent imply that consent to avoid\nostracism would be valid (e.g., Nozick 1974); others do not (e.g.,\nCohen 1988). As it happens, transplanters will often furnish reluctant\ndonors with \u201cwhite lies\u201d to enable them to avoid donating\nwhile retaining the appearance of honour. For instance, reluctant\ndonors may be told to say they are clinically unsuitable on anatomical\ngrounds. Whether \u201cwhite lies\u201d are mandatory or even\npermissible depends partly on resolving the question of when family\npressure undercuts valid consent (den Hartogh 2008b).\n\nMany living donor programs use extensive psychosocial screening as\nwell as a lengthy consent process (Price 2000). Potential donors are\nscreened for physical health, which is largely uncontroversial, but\nthey are also screened for their motivations. The typical advice is to\nscreen for excessive sense of duty, undue influence, unconscious\ninternal neurotic influences, and abnormal emotional involvement.\nScreening of this nature is more controversial since it involves\nmaking difficult judgments about what counts as excessive in a sense\nof duty, undue in influence, and abnormal in emotional involvement,\nand it requires spotting neurotic influences. At least in the past,\nsome critics have thought that transplant professionals have overused\ntheir power to refuse people as donors (MacFarquhar 2009).\n\nTo take one example, consider whether a member of a religious sect,\nsuch as the Jesus Christians, should be allowed to donate to a\nstranger. It may be thought that such a person could not be giving\nvalid consent, perhaps because of what a sect has done (the\n\u201cbrainwashing\u201d worry) or because of some psychological\nvulnerability. However, it is often difficult to decide whether a way\nof influencing someone is illegitimate or whether motivations and\nbeliefs are signs of mental illness (see entry on\n mental disorder).\n",
