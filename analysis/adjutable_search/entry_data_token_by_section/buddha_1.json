    "main_text": "Core Teachings\n2. Core Teachings\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s basic teachings are usually summarized using the\ndevice of the Four Nobles\u2019 Truths:\n\nThere is suffering.\nThere is the origination of suffering.\nThere is the cessation of suffering.\nThere is a path to the cessation of suffering.\n\n\nThe first of these claims might seem obvious, even when\n\u2018suffering\u2019 is understood to mean not mere pain but\nexistential suffering, the sort of frustration, alienation and despair\nthat arise out of our experience of transitoriness. But there are said\nto be different levels of appreciation of this truth, some quite\nsubtle and difficult to attain; the highest of these is said to\ninvolve the realization that everything is of the nature of suffering.\nPerhaps it is sufficient for present purposes to point out that while\nthis is not the implausible claim that all of life\u2019s states and\nevents are necessarily experienced as unsatisfactory, still the\nrealization that all (oneself included) is impermanent can undermine a\nprecondition for real enjoyment of the events in a life: that such\nevents are meaningful by virtue of their having a place in an\nopen-ended narrative.\n\nIt is with the development and elaboration of (2) that substantive\nphilosophical controversy begins. (2) is the simple claim that there\nare causes and conditions for the arising of suffering. (3) then makes\nthe obvious point that if the origination of suffering depends on\ncauses, future suffering can be prevented by bringing about the\ncessation of those causes. (4) specifies a set of techniques that are\nsaid to be effective in such cessation. Much then hangs on the correct\nidentification of the causes of suffering. The answer is traditionally\nspelled out in a list consisting of twelve links in a causal chain\nthat begins with ignorance and ends with suffering (represented by the\nstates of old age, disease and death). Modern scholarship has\nestablished that this list is a later compilation. For the texts that\nclaim to convey the Buddha\u2019s own teachings give two slightly\ndifferent formulations of this list, and shorter formulations\ncontaining only some of the twelve items are also found in the texts.\nBut it seems safe to say that the Buddha taught an analysis of the\norigins of suffering roughly along the following lines: given the\nexistence of a fully functioning assemblage of psychophysical elements\n(the parts that make up a sentient being), ignorance concerning the\nthree characteristics of sentient existence\u2014suffering,\nimpermanence and non-self\u2014will lead, in the course of normal\ninteractions with the environment, to appropriation (the\nidentification of certain elements as \u2018I\u2019 and\n\u2018mine\u2019). This leads in turn to the formation of\nattachments, in the form of desire and aversion, and the strengthening\nof ignorance concerning the true nature of sentient existence. These\nensure future rebirth, and thus future instances of old age, disease\nand death, in a potentially unending cycle.\n\nThe key to escape from this cycle is said to lie in realization of the\ntruth about sentient existence\u2014that it is characterized by\nsuffering, impermanence and non-self. But this realization is not\neasily achieved, since acts of appropriation have already made desire,\naversion and ignorance deeply entrenched habits of mind. Thus the\nmeasures specified in (4) include various forms of training designed\nto replace such habits with others that are more conducive to seeing\nthings as they are. Among these is training in meditation, which\nserves among other things as a way of enhancing one\u2019s\nobservational abilities with respect to one\u2019s own\npsychological states. Insight is cultivated through the use of these\nnewly developed observational powers, as informed by knowledge\nacquired through the exercise of philosophical rationality. There is a\ndebate in the later tradition as to whether final release can be\nattained through theoretical insight alone, through meditation alone,\nor only by using both techniques. Ch\u2019an, for instance, is based\non the premise that enlightenment can be attained through meditation\nalone, whereas Therav\u0101da advocates using both but also holds that\nanalysis alone may be sufficient for some. (This disagreement begins\nwith a dispute over how to interpret D I.77\u201384; see Cousins\n2022, 81\u20136.) The third option seems the most plausible, but the first\nis certainly of some interest given its suggestion that one can attain\nthe ideal state for humans just by doing philosophy.\n\nThe Buddha seems to have held (2) to constitute the core of his\ndiscovery. He calls his teachings a \u2018middle path\u2019 between\ntwo extreme views, and it is this claim concerning the causal origins\nof suffering that he identifies as the key to avoiding those extremes.\nThe extremes are eternalism, the view that persons are eternal, and\nannihilationism, the view that persons go utterly out of existence\n(usually understood to mean at death, though a term still shorter than\none lifetime is not ruled out). It will be apparent that eternalism\nrequires the existence of the sort of self that the Buddha denies.\nWhat is not immediately evident is why the denial of such a self is\nnot tantamount to the claim that the person is annihilated at death\n(or even sooner, depending on just how impermanent one takes the\npsychophysical elements to be). The solution to this puzzle lies in\nthe fact that eternalism and annihilationism both share the\npresupposition that there is an \u2018I\u2019 whose existence might\neither extend beyond death or terminate at death. The idea of the\n\u2018middle path\u2019 is that all of life\u2019s continuities can\nbe explained in terms of facts about a causal series of psychophysical\nelements. There being nothing more than a succession of these\nimpermanent, impersonal events and states, the question of the\nultimate fate of this \u2018I\u2019, the supposed owner of these\nelements, simply does not arise.\n\nThis reductionist view of sentient beings was later articulated in\nterms of the distinction between two kinds of truth, conventional and\nultimate. Each kind of truth has its own domain of objects, the things\nthat are only conventionally real and the things that are ultimately\nreal respectively. Conventionally real entities are those things that\nare accepted as real by common sense, but that turn out on further\nanalysis to be wholes compounded out of simpler entities and thus not\nstrictly speaking real at all. The stock example of a conventionally\nreal entity is the chariot, which we take to be real only because it\nis more convenient, given our interests and cognitive limitations, to\nhave a single name for the parts when assembled in the right way.\nSince our belief that there are chariots is thus due to our having a\ncertain useful concept, the chariot is said to be a mere conceptual\nfiction. (This does not, however, mean that all conceptualization is\nfalsification; only concepts that allow of reductive analysis lead to\nthis artificial inflation of our ontology, and thus to a kind of\nerror.) Ultimately real entities are those ultimate parts into which\nconceptual fictions are analyzable. An ultimately true statement is\none that correctly describes how certain ultimately real entities are\narranged. A conventionally true statement is one that, given how the\nultimately real entities are arranged, would correctly describe\ncertain conceptual fictions if they also existed. The ultimate truth\nconcerning the relevant ultimately real entities helps explain why it\nshould turn out to be useful to accept conventionally true statements\n(such as \u2018King Milinda rode in a chariot\u2019) when the\nobjects described in those statements are mere fictions.\n\nUsing this distinction between the two truths, the key insight of the\n\u2018middle path\u2019 may be expressed as follows. The ultimate\ntruth about sentient beings is just that there is a causal series of\nimpermanent, impersonal psychophysical elements. Since these are all\nimpermanent, and lack other properties that would be required of an\nessence of the person, none of them is a self. But given the right\narrangement of such entities in a causal series, it is useful to think\nof them as making up one thing, a person. It is thus conventionally\ntrue that there are persons, things that endure for a lifetime and\npossibly (if there is rebirth) longer. This is conventionally true\nbecause generally speaking there is more overall happiness and less\noverall pain and suffering when one part of such a series identifies\nwith other parts of the same series. For instance, when the present\nset of psychophysical elements identifies with future elements, it is\nless likely to engage in behavior (such as smoking) that results in\npresent pleasure but far greater future pain. The utility of this\nconvention is, however, limited. Past a certain point\u2014namely the\npoint at which we take it too seriously, as more than just a useful\nfiction\u2014it results in existential suffering. The cessation of\nsuffering is attained by extirpating all sense of an \u2018I\u2019\nthat serves as agent and owner.\n",
