    "main_text": "Meta-Science: Establishing, Monitoring, and Evaluating the Reproducibility Crisis || Reproducibility Projects\n2.1 Reproducibility Projects\n\nThe most well known of these projects is undoubtedly the\nReproducibility Project: Psychology, coordinated by the now Center for\nOpen Science in Charlottesville, VA (then the Open Science\nCollaboration). It involved 270 crowd sourced researchers in 64\ndifferent institutions in 11 different countries. Researchers\nattempted direct replications of 100 studies published in three\nleading psychology journals in the year 2008. Each study was\nreplicated only once. Replications attempted to follow original\nprotocols as closely as possible, though some differences were\nunavoidable (e.g., some replication studies were done with European\nsamples when the original studies used US samples). In almost all\ncases, replication studies used larger sample sizes that the original\nstudies and therefore had greater statistical power\u2014that is, a\ngreater probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e.,\nthat no relationship exists) when the hypothesis is false. A number of\nmeasures of reproducibility were reported:\n\nThe proportion of studies in which there was a match in the\nstatistical significance between original and replication. (Here, the\nstatistical significance of a result is the probability that it would\noccur given the null hypothesis, and p values are common\nmeasures of such probabilities. A replication study and an original\nstudy would have a match in statistical significance if, for example,\nthey both specified that the probability of the original and\nreplication results occurring given the null hypothesis is less than\n5%\u2014i.e., if the p values for results in both studies are\nbelow 0.05.) Thirty nine percent (36%) of results were successful\nreproduced according to this measure.\nThe proportion of studies in which the Effect Size (ES) of the\nreplication study fell within the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the\noriginal. (Here, an ES represents the strength of a relationship\nbetween phenomena\u2014a toy example of which is how strongly\nconsumption of a drug is correlated with symptom relief\u2014and a\nConfidence Interval provides some indication of the probability that\nthe ES of the replication study is close to the ES of the original\nstudy.) Forty seven percent (47%) of results were successfully\nreproduced according to this measure.\nThe correlation between original ES and replication ES.\nReplication study ESs were roughly half the size of original ESs.\nThe proportion of studies for which subjective ratings by\nindependent researchers indicated a match between the replication and\nthe original. Thirty nine percent (39%) were considered successful\nreproductions according to this measure. The closeness of this figure\nto measure 1 suggests that raters relied very heavily on p\nvalues in making their judgements.\n\n\nThere have been objections to the implementation and interpretation of\nthis project, most notably by Gilbert et al. (2016), who took issue\nwith the extent to which the replications studies were indeed direct\nreplications. For example, Gilbert et al. highlighted 6 specific\nexamples of \u201clow fidelity protocols\u201d, that is, where\nreplication studies differed in their view substantially from the\noriginal (in one case, using a European sample rather than a US sample\nof participants). However, Anderson et al. (2016) explained in a reply\nthat in half of those cases, the authors of the original study had\nendorsed the replication as being direct or close to on relevant\ndimensions and that furthermore, that independently rated similarity\nbetween original and replication studies failed to predict replication\nsuccess. Others (e.g., Etz & Vandekerckhove 2016) have applied\nBayesian reanalysis to the OSC\u2019s (2015) data and conclude that\nup to 75% (as opposed to the OSC\u2019s 36\u201347%) of replications\ncould be considered successful. However, they do note that in many\ncases this is only with very weak evidence (i.e., Bayes factors of\n<10). They too conclude that the failure to reproduce many effects\nis indeed explained by the overestimation of effect sizes, itself a\nproduct of publication bias. A Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology\n(also coordinated by the Center for Open Science) is currently\nunderway (Errington et al. 2014), originally attempting to replicate\n50 of the highest impact studies in Cancer Biology published between\n2010\u20132012. This project has recently announced it will complete\nwith only 18 replication studies, as too few originals reported enough\ninformation to proceed with full replications (Kaiser 2018). Results\nof the first 10 studies are reportedly mixed, with only 5 being\nconsidered \u201cmostly repeatable\u201d (Kaiser 2018).\n\nThe Many Labs project (Klein et al. 2014) coordinated 36 independent\nreplications of 13 classic psychology phenomena (from 12 studies, that\nis, one study tested two effects), including anchoring, sunk cost bias\nand priming, amongst other well-known effects in psychology. In terms\nof matching statistical significance, the project demonstrated that 11\nout of 13 effects could be successful replicated. It also showed great\nvariation in many of the effect sizes across the 36 replications.\n\nIn biomedical research, there have also been a number of large scale\nreproducibility projects. An early one by Begley and Ellis (2012, but\ndiscussed earlier in Ioannidis 2005) attempted to replicate 56\nlandmark pre-clinical trials and reported an alarming reproducibility\nrate of only 11%, that is, only 6 of the 56 results could be\nsuccessfully reproduced. Subsequent attempts at large scale\nreplications in this field have produced more optimistic estimates,\nbut routinely failed to successfully reproduce more than half of the\npublished results. Freedman et al. (2015) report five replication\nprojects by independent groups of researchers which produce\nreproducibility estimates ranging from 22% to 49%. They estimate the\ncost of irreproducible research in US biomedical science alone to be\nin the order of USD$28 billion per year. A reproducibility project in\nExperimental Philosophy is an exception to the general trend,\nreporting reproducibility rates of 70% (Cova et al. forthcoming).\n\nFinally, the Social Science Replication Project (SSRP) redid 21\nexperimental social science studies published in the journals Nature\nand Science between 2010 and 2015. Depending on the measure taken, the\nreplication success rate was 57\u201367% (Camerer et al. 2018).\n",
