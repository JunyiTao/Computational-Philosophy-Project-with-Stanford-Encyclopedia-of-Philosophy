    "main_text": "Dualisms\n4. Dualisms\n\nIn the previous section we outlined a project of\n\u201cuncovering\u201d relations in apparently non-relational\nframeworks. In the sort of cases we had in mind what\u2019s\n\u201cuncovered\u201d are concrete social relations, e.g., relations\nof sexual subordination. However, Beauvoir\u2019s claims about\nSubject and Other point to additional insights not yet explored.\n\nIn saying that \u201cHe is the Subject, he is the Absolute\u2014She\nis the Other\u201d, part of Beauvoir\u2019s point is that although\nit may appear that our distinction between subjects and non-subjects\nis a purely descriptive demarcation of a specific category of\nsubstances (selves), in fact, the distinction in use is normative and\nnon-substantive. Begin with the issue of substances: one of the\ntraditional characteristics of substances is that substances do not\nhave opposites, i.e., there is no opposite of horse (non-horse does\nnot count as an opposite). This is in contrast to many qualities:\nlong/short, inside/outside, loud/quiet. One way of explicating\nBeauvoir\u2019s suggestion is that once we look at the conditions for\nsubjecthood, we see that there is an opposite to being a subject:\nsubjects are, for example, free and autonomous persons, and the\nopposite of a free and autonomous person is someone unfree, in her\nterms, someone condemned to immanence. Moreover, it is not only the\ncase that being a subject has an opposite, but that the opposition in\nquestion carries normative weight\u2014so much so that the devalued\nside of the opposition (the Other) is denied reality in its own terms:\nwhat it is to be Other just is to be opposite to the Subject.\n\nAgain the feminist project is one of unmasking certain ordinary\nassumptions about our classifications of things: the category of\nSubject is not\u2014ontologically speaking\u2014what it may seem.\nMore specifically, categories that appear to be descriptive may in\nfact be functioning normatively; and categories that appear to be\nsubstantive, may in fact be functioning as one end of a qualitative\nspectrum. Although Beauvoir\u2019s example has us focus on the notion\nof a subject or self; feminists have explored the same form of\nargument with other notions, notably, sex, gender, and race.\n\nThere are two significant consequences of this sort of analysis.\nFirst, with substances, it is standardly supposed that you are a\nmember of the kind or not and there is no middle ground: you are a\nhorse or you aren\u2019t. (Because there is no opposite or contrary\nto horse, the only negative option a contradictory.) Again we can\ncontrast this with other opposites: there is a middle ground between\nlong/short, inside/outside, loud/quiet; and some things avoid the\nopposition altogether, e.g., my coffee mug is neither loud nor quiet.\nCasting a category as substantial, then, limits the available\ncategories for classification. For example, suppose we understand\n\u2018male\u2019 substantively. If males are a substance kind, then\neverything is either male or not-male, with no middle-ground. But if,\nin practice, \u2018not-male\u2019 actually functions as a way of\npicking out females, then it would seem that everything must be either\nmale or female, and there can be no space for genuine categories of\npeople who are intersexed, or other-sexed, or for refusing to sex\npeople at all. One strategy, then, for undermining the idea that a\ncategory is substantival is to highlight the multiplicity of\nindividuals and categories \u201cin between\u201d the primary\ncategory and its implicit opposite. Category proliferation\u2014the\ngeneration of a continuum or genuinely \u201cmixed\u201d\ncategories\u2014can loosen the grip of substantival assumptions\n(Butler 1987; Lugones 1994; Haraway 1988; Zack 1995).\n\nSecond, in the case of substance kinds, those things that are not in\nthe kind don\u2019t themselves form a kind of their own. They are\nwhat\u2019s \u201cleft over\u201d. The class of all things that are\nnot-horses includes computers, stars, dust, basketballs, people, etc.\nSo, if we elide \u2018not man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019, then\nwomen are not read as a kind. As Marilyn Frye puts it,\n\n\nWhen woman is defined as not-man, she is cast into the infinite\nundifferentiated plenum\u2026[this partly explains why] many men can\nso naturally speak in parallel constructions of their cars and their\nwomen, and say things like, \u201cIt\u2019s my house, my wife, and\nmy money, and the government can\u2019t tell me what to do about any\nof it\u201d. It also illuminates the fact that women are so easily\nassociated with disorder, chaos, irrationality, and\nimpurity\u2026.There are no categories in not-man; it is a buzzing\nbooming confusion. (Frye 1996: 1000) \n\n\nFrye\u2019s strategy is not to challenge the substantive status of\nthe man-kind by proliferation, but to challenge its hegemony in the\nspace of persons. So she proposes the construction of a woman-kind\nthat is defined in its own terms, not simply by opposition to men (see\nSchor & Weed 1994). She argues, among other things, that this will\nrequire a recognition of real differences not only between men and\nwomen, but among\n women.[7]\n\nThis barely scratches the surface of feminist discussion of the\ndualisms that guide our thinking, both in philosophy and common sense.\nThese include mind/body, reason/emotion (Jaggar 1989; Scheman 1993;\nRooney 1993, 1994; Campbell 1998), nature/culture (Ortner 1972; Butler\n1993), freedom/necessity (Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000; Hirschmann\n2003; Holroyd 2011), agent/patient (Meyers 2004a,b). However, it does,\nhopefully, provide some introduction to the feminist issues that arise\nin thinking about classification, substances, dichotomy, and the\npotential political import of ontology and the prime importance of the\nquestion of value ladenness and attention to ideology in feminist\ntheorizing (Alcoff 2011; Haslanger 2011; Janack 2011).\n",
