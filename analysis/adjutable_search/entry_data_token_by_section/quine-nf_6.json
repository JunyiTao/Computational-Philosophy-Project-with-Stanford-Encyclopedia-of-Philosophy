    "main_text": "Implementation of Mathematical Concepts in NF\n7. Coda\n\n\nThe current status of NF studies is odd. In the 1970s Boffa and Coret\nproved some interesting results about stratified formul\u00e6 in\ntheories of wellfounded sets, and work continues. However there is\nlittle traffic in the other direction and it seems unlikely that NF\nwill attract the attention of a critical mass of scholars until\nsomeone succeeds in proving it consistent relative to ZF or one of its\nkin, (and even this is uncertain, for NFU is known to be consistent\nand still finds few friends) and this consistency question seems to be\nvery hard. There are older unresolved issues in Set Theory \u2013 CH\nfor one \u2013 but the status of NF does seem to be the oldest\noutstanding consistency question. The fact that NF refutes\nthe axiom of choice sharpens the consistency problem greatly, and\nought to sharpen public interest, but the widely-held view that sets\nare, of their essence, wellfounded represents a huge rhetorical\nobstacle to NF attracting the attention that its foundational interest\nmerits. That idea is now (post Aczel [1988]) less suffocating than it\nwas, but is still casts a shadow. The shadow it casts falls over NFU\nas well, which is unfortunate, since NFU is known to be consistent,\nand has a wealth of interesting model theory. It also distracts us\nfrom the most basic feature of NF: as a theory of a universal set, it\ndoes at least represent an earnest endeavour to take the paradoxical\nclasses seriously, and not just erase them. \u201cCowards, you\nnotice\u201d says Higgins in Pygmalion \u201care always shrieking to\nhave troublesome people killed\u201d.\n",
