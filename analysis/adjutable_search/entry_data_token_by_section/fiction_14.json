    "main_text": "The Paradox of Fiction\n4. The Paradox of Fiction\n\nWhether works of fiction provides readers with knowledge (and, if so,\nwhat kind), there is little doubt that authors of such works often aim\nto communicate what they take to be salient truths in the hope of\naffecting their readers in some way. Upton Sinclair, for example,\nwanted readers of The Jungle (1906) to recognize the poor\ntreatment of workers in Chicago slaughter-houses, and to respond to\nthis treatment with anger. Even more familiar, however, is the way\nauthors try to get readers of a work of fiction to respond emotionally\nto the fictional truths they encounter in the work, rather\nthan any actual truths. To take a classic example, on reading\nTolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina, a reader may feel deep pity\nfor Anna Karenina because of her increasing despair as Vronsky\ndistances himself from her, an emotion Tolstoy no doubt expected and\nintended. But this generates a famous puzzle: how can a reader feel\npity for Anna, knowing that Anna doesn\u2019t exist? This puzzle,\ncommonly known as the paradox of fiction or the paradox\nof fictional emotions, involves a triad of seemingly compelling\nbut incompatible claims about emotional responses generated by\nengaging with fiction. For a representative formulation: \n\n(A) People\nexperience emotions for fictional objects and situations, knowing them\nto be fictional\n(B) People do\nnot believe that fictional objects and situations exist\n(C) In order\nto experience an emotion for an object or situation, one must believe\nthat it exists\n\n\n(A broadly equivalent formulation is found in Gendler\u2019s entry on\n imagination.)\n The question is how best to resolve the inconsistency among these\nclaims; that is, which of (A)\u2013(C) to give up so that consistency\nis restored, and why these and not others.\n\nDifferent solutions to the paradox provide different answers to such\nquestions, although it is worth noting that the paper that introduced\nthe paradox to the philosophical world, Colin Radford\u2019s\n\u201cHow can we be moved by the fate of Anna Karenina?\u201d\n(Radford 1975) took a rather different line from other solutions. His\nIrrationalist solution (our classification follows Levinson\n1997) holds that people\u2019s apparent ability to respond\nemotionally to fictional characters and events is \u201cirrational,\nincoherent, and inconsistent\u201d (Radford 1975: 75). They regard\n(C) as a normative constraint on rational agents, but their actual\nbehavior and beliefs, as described in (A) and (B), show that they fail\nto conform to this constraint.\n\nDissatisfaction with Radford\u2019s account resulted in numerous\npublications that have kept discussion of the problem alive. Most, in\nfact, favor a rejection of (A) or (C). Among those who reject (A),\nsome deny (A) on the grounds that it misdescribes the nature of our\naffective responses. According to the Non-Intentionalist\nsolution the affective states in question are not emotions but more\nakin to object-less states like moods or reflex reactions (Charlton\n1970: 97), while for the more popular Surrogate-Object\nsolution (A) misidentifies the target of emotional responses to\nfiction: they really have as their objects (parts of) the fictional\nwork itself; or perhaps the descriptions or thought contents afforded\nby the fiction (Lamarque 1981); or on another formulation real\nindividuals or phenomena that resemble the persons or events of the\nfiction (see, for example, Charlton 1984).\n\nA third way of denying\n (A)\n is Kendall Walton\u2019s well-known Make-Believe solution\nto the paradox (Walton 1990, 1997; see also Currie 1990). According to\nWalton, it is fictional in the imaginative games of make-believe that\npeople play on the basis of their reading works of fiction that they\nexperience emotions for fictional objects and situations. In reality\nthey don\u2019t. A reader of Anna Karenina (1877)\ndoesn\u2019t really pity Anna Karenina, but what she does experience\nare various characteristic psychological and bodily effects of her\nimagining that Anna Karenina has suffered greatly.\nOriginally, Walton called states of this kind quasi-emotions (in this\ncase, quasi-pity); the fact that a reader experiences quasi-pity in\nthe course of her imagining is what makes it fictional in her game of\nmake-believe that she feels genuine pity for Anna Karenina. A case of\nreal pity, by contrast, requires the quasi-pity that an agent\nexperiences to be the result of her genuine belief that someone is\nsuffering or has suffered (Walton 1990: 251), and only when this is\nits cause will the quasi-pity also be accompanied by appropriate\nbehavior: an attempt to console if consoling is within one\u2019s\npower, say. (Walton\u2019s classic example of the absence of\nappropriate behavior is that of not running out of the theatre, even\nthough in the grip of quasi-fear, while watching a horror movie in\nwhich the Green Slime turns towards you.) Walton clarifies his view in\nWalton 1997, where he emphasizes that he regards fictional emotions\nnot so much as special kind of states, but as emotions that are merely\nfelt in the context of engaging with fiction rather than actuality.\nWhat Walton cannot allow, however, is that it is genuinely true that\npeople have emotions in this sense towards fictional characters like\nAnna Karenina. No relational claims of this kind can be genuinely true\nfor Walton, since he denies that there are any fictional characters.\n(Whether his rejection of fictional characters is required by his\nreasons for rejecting (A) is another question. For more on this\nquestion, see the entry on\n fictional entities.)\n\n\nWalton\u2019s view has been subject to much criticism (for a survey,\nsee Neill 2005). Before we turn to its main rivals, it is worth\nobserving that Walton\u2019s main reason for not counting fictional\nemotions as real emotions (the lack of characteristic associated\nbehavior) is also the main reason why few commentators nowadays accept\nthe Suspension of Disbelief solution, which involves\nrejecting\n (B)\n and maintaining that when readers of fiction emotionally respond to\nthe characters they read about they are acting on an implicit belief\nthat these exist. (Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who coined the term, may\nhave held a version of this view; cf. Coleridge 1817: ch. 14 [in vol.\n2, p. 2].) For discussion, see Radford 1975, Schaper 1978, and Carroll\n1990.) \n\nFar more popular are views that reject\n (C)\n and hold that we have real emotions towards fictional objects despite\nbelieving that they don\u2019t exist. A possible reason for this is\nthat, unlike the two other statements of the triad, (C) strikes many\nas a piece of articulated theory (the so-called cognitive theory of\nemotion) rather than a commonsense claim (cf. Gendler 2008). One way\nof rejecting (C) is the Surrogate-Belief solution, which\nmaintains that an emotional response to a fictional character requires\nno more than the belief that the character exists in the world(s) of the\nfiction (cf. Neill 1993). Another solution\u2014and possibly\nthe most widely accepted of all\u2014is the\nAnti-Judgmentalist solution, which denies that emotional\nresponses to objects logically require beliefs concerning the\nexistence and emotion-prompting features of objects; instead, it is\nenough if we imagine, \u201cmentally represent\u201d (Lamarque\n1981), or entertain, such objects \u201cin thought\u201d (Carroll\n1990). (See also Stecker 2011, which regards this solution as in some\nsense the default solution; he thinks other solutions are nonetheless\nworth investigating because of the way they shed light on the way our\nreactions to fiction often differ from standard emotional reactions.)\nVersions of such \u201cthought theories\u201d are also defended in\nMoran 1994, Smith 1995, Feagin 1996, and Gendler 2008. But note that\nsuch views face the problem that the objects of the emotions mobilized\nby fiction are either understood in some nonstandard way, for example\nas thought contents (cf. the objection in Walton 1990 to Lamarque\n1981) or, more generally, as abstract rather than concrete entities;\nor they are understood as nonexistent objects, a category many\nphilosophers find ontologically problematic. (For a useful overview of\nthe various solutions, see Gendler & Kovakovich 2006. See also the\nentry on\n fictional entities.)\n",
