    "main_text": "Conflicts across time in the formerly competent || Challenge III: Loss of personal identity\n3.5 Challenge IV: Severance of prudential concern\n\n\nIt is possible to retain the intuitive idea that the weakness of\npsychological connections between the two selves undermines the\nauthority of the earlier self over the current self without accepting\nthe metaphysical view that the earlier and current self are numerically\ndistinct entities. Suppose we maintain that even the most drastic\nmental deterioration is not equivalent to death \u2014 that the same\nindividual persists through the ravages of Alzheimer's disease. We can\nstill question the continuity of interest between the earlier and\ncurrent self by examining the concern the earlier and current self\nwould appropriately have for one another (McMahan 2002).\n\n\nOrdinarily, each of us has a very unique type of concern for our own\npast and future selves: it matters to you, in a very special way, what\nhappens to you, what experiences you undergo, how\nyou act, etc., now, in the future, and in the past. Call this\nspecial species of concern prudential concern. We normally\nassume that prudential concern strictly tracks personal identity: one\nhas prudential concern only for oneself and one is always concerned\nwith oneself in this way. By contrast, Jeff McMahan has argued that (at\nleast within the bounds of numerical identity) prudential concern also\nought to track the degree of psychological ties: prudential concern of\ntwo selves at different stages of life for one another ought to weaken\nin proportion to the weakness of the psychological connection between\nthem (McMahan 2002, 69-82). In the context of the severe psychological\ntransformations caused by a disease like Alzheimer's, this means that\nthe appropriate level of prudential concern of the earlier and current\nself for one another would be rather slight. The two selves are not\nbound by a sufficiently strong common prudential interest, and so the\nperson's earlier interests, no matter how important, do not transfer as\nparticularly important interests of her current psychologically\ndisconnected self. Any potential conflicts between the interests of the\ntwo selves are now akin to conflicts between two entities with\naltogether independent interests.\n\n\nDavid DeGrazia has tried to counter this picture by suggesting that,\nin addition to the factors discussed by McMahan, the earlier self's\nappropriate degree of prudential concern for the current self can be\nboosted by the earlier self's autonomously formed self-narrative: if\nthe earlier self identified with the current self, in the sense of\nseeing the current self as a true stage in the unfolding complex\nnarrative of her life, strong prudential concern is warranted (DeGrazia\n2005, 196). Oddly, this view makes the rational level of prudential\nconcern for the future partly a matter of choice of the earlier self.\nYet, unlike our ordinary concerns for specific plans, projects, other\npeople, etc., which are up to us, prudential concern is a requirement\nof rationality and should not be a matter of choice. Just as we cannot\nrationally have prudential concern for someone else simply because we\nhappen to incorporate (perhaps delusionally) their life into our\nself-narrative, similarly, if we are not otherwise warranted to have\nprudential concern for our own future self, we cannot change this\nsimply by virtue of how we happen to construct our self-narrative.\n\n\nReturn, then, to McMahan's picture. If the interests of the earlier\nand current self are genuinely prudentially estranged and independent,\nhow should we resolve conflicts between them?\n\n\nWhen the current self is still a person, her rights as a person call\nfor allowing her interests to control her treatment and against letting\nthe interests of the earlier self interfere; any weakness in the\ncurrent self's prudential connection to the earlier self merely\nreinforces this stance. But how should we balance the interests of the\ntwo prudentially estranged selves when the current self is not a\nperson?\n\n\nMcMahan himself suggests that, in a conflict between an earlier person\nand a current nonperson, the interests of the earlier person ought to\ntrump (McMahan 2002, 502-03). He emphasizes that the earlier self is a\n\u201chigher self,\u201d \u201crational and autonomous,\u201d and\nthat her interests are associated with the dominant, more substantial\nand lengthy part of life, integrated \u2014 through strong prudential\nconnections among its various stages \u2014 into one unified life-segment.\nBut part of McMahan's reasoning is also that the interests of the\ncurrent nonperson are, as types of interests, not very substantial.\nHere McMahan relies on the specifics of the example of conflict he\nhappens to analyze (a version of the \u201cpreference to die\u201d\nexample we saw earlier), together with a controversial claim that a\nseverely demented patient would not have a strong interest in\ncontinuing to live.\n\n\nWhile McMahan may be right that strong interests of an earlier\nperson trump comparatively trivial interests of a current nonperson,\nhis answer covers only a subset of possible conflicts between the\nearlier and current self. It is much more difficult to arbitrate\nbetween the two selves when the interests of the current nonperson are\nalso substantial. I have argued (Jaworska unpublished) that when the\ninterests of the earlier person are relatively minor, substantial\ninterests of the current nonperson ought to trump. Thus, for example,\nif the earlier self had only a relatively weak preference to die \u2014\nlet's say she simply didn't want to further complicate relationships\nwith family members for whom she happened not to care all that much \u2014\nthe current self's substantial interest in continuing to live ought to\nprevail. More controversially, I also argued that highly vital\ninterests of the current nonperson ought to trump even some\nnon-trivial, rather serious interests of the earlier person. Thus, in\nthe standard version of the \u201cpreference to die\u201d scenario, what is\nat stake for the earlier self is a rather serious interest in\nmaintaining the integrity of her life narrative. However, this interest\ndoes not reach the level of high vitality, because there is only so\nmuch damage that a period of senility at the end of a life can do to an\notherwise successful life-narrative. By contrast, the current self's\ninterest in her very survival is more highly vital. It is also, unlike\nthe earlier self's interest, an active interest \u2014 an ongoing subject\nof interests has reason to be strongly prudentially invested in it.\nThese factors combined lend, in this scenario, priority to the interest\nof the current self.\n",
