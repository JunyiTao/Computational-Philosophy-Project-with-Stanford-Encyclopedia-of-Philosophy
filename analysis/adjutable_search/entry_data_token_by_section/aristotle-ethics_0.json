    "main_text": "Preliminaries\n1. Preliminaries\n\nAristotle wrote two ethical treatises: the Nicomachean Ethics\nand the Eudemian Ethics. He does not himself use either of\nthese titles, although in the Politics (1295a36) he refers\nback to one of them\u2014probably the Eudemian\nEthics\u2014as \u201cta \u00eathika\u201d\u2014his\nwritings about character. The words \u201cEudemian\u201d\nand \u201cNicomachean\u201d were added later, perhaps\nbecause the former was edited by his friend, Eudemus, and the latter\nby his son, Nicomachus. In any case, these two works cover more or\nless the same ground: they begin with a discussion of\neudaimonia (\u201chappiness\u201d,\n\u201cflourishing\u201d), and turn to an examination of the nature\nof aret\u00ea (\u201cvirtue\u201d,\n\u201cexcellence\u201d) and the character traits that human beings\nneed in order to live life at its best. Both treatises examine the\nconditions in which praise or blame are appropriate, and the nature of\npleasure and friendship; near the end of each work, we find a brief\ndiscussion of the proper relationship between human beings and the\ndivine.\n\nThough the general point of view expressed in each work is the same,\nthere are many subtle differences in organization and content as well.\nClearly, one is a re-working of the other, and although no single\npiece of evidence shows conclusively what their order is, it is widely\nassumed that the Nicomachean Ethics is a later and improved\nversion of the Eudemian Ethics. (Not all of the Eudemian\nEthics was revised: its Books IV, V, and VI re-appear as V, VI,\nVII of the Nicomachean Ethics.) Perhaps the most telling\nindication of this ordering is that in several instances the\nNicomachean Ethics develops a theme about which its\nEudemian cousin is silent. Only the Nicomachean\nEthics discusses the close relationship between ethical inquiry\nand politics; only the Nicomachean Ethics critically examines\nSolon\u2019s paradoxical dictum that no man should be counted happy\nuntil he is dead; and only the Nicomachean Ethics gives a\nseries of arguments for the superiority of the philosophical life to\nthe political life. The remainder of this article will therefore focus\non this work. [Note: Page and line numbers shall henceforth refer to\nthis treatise.]\n\nA third treatise, called the Magna Moralia (the \u201cBig\nEthics\u201d) is included in complete editions of Aristotle\u2019s\nworks, but its authorship is disputed by scholars. It ranges over\ntopics discussed more fully in the other two works and its point of\nview is similar to theirs. (Why, being briefer, is it named the\nMagna Moralia? Because each of the two papyrus rolls into\nwhich it is divided is unusually long. Just as a big mouse can be a\nsmall animal, two big chapters can make a small book. This work was\nevidently named \u201cbig\u201d with reference to its parts, not the\nwhole.) A few authors in antiquity refer to a work with this name and\nattribute it to Aristotle, but it is not mentioned by several\nauthorities, such as Cicero and Diogenes Laertius, whom we would\nexpect to have known of it. Some scholars hold that it is\nAristotle\u2019s earliest course on ethics\u2014perhaps his own\nlecture notes or those of a student; others regard it as a\npost-Aristotelian compilation or adaption of one or both of his\ngenuine ethical treatises.\n\nAlthough Aristotle is deeply indebted to Plato\u2019s moral\nphilosophy, particularly Plato\u2019s central insight that moral\nthinking must be integrated with our emotions and appetites, and that\nthe preparation for such unity of character should begin with\nchildhood education, the systematic character of Aristotle\u2019s\ndiscussion of these themes was a remarkable innovation. No one had\nwritten ethical treatises before Aristotle. Plato\u2019s\nRepublic, for example, does not treat ethics as a distinct\nsubject matter; nor does it offer a systematic examination of the\nnature of happiness, virtue, voluntariness, pleasure, or friendship.\nTo be sure, we can find in Plato\u2019s works important discussions\nof these phenomena, but they are not brought together and unified as\nthey are in Aristotle\u2019s ethical writings.\n",
