During the course of his life, he was a mathematician\nfirst, a natural scientist or \u201cnatural philosopher\u201d\nsecond, and a metaphysician third. In mathematics, he developed the\ntechniques that made possible algebraic (or \u201canalytic\u201d)\ngeometry. In natural philosophy, he can be credited with several\nachievements: the first to publish the sine law of refraction;\ndeveloper of an important empirical account of the rainbow; and\nproposer of a naturalistic account of the formation of the earth and\nplanets (a precursor to the nebular hypothesis, that the planets\nformed from loose matter orbiting the sun). More importantly, he\noffered a new vision of the natural world, which shaped modern\nphysics: a world of matter possessing a few fundamental properties and\ninteracting according to a few universal laws. This natural world\nincluded an immaterial mind that, in human beings, was directly\nrelated to the brain, a position that led to the modern\nmind\u2013body problem. In metaphysics (the search for the basic\nprinciples of everything there is), Descartes provided arguments for\nthe existence of God and to show that the essence of matter is to be\nspatially extended, and that the essence of mind is thought (where\n\u201cthought\u201d includes sensory images as well as rational\ndiscourse). Descartes claimed early on to possess a special method,\nwhich was variously exhibited in mathematics, natural philosophy, and\nmetaphysics, and which came to include, or to be supplemented by, a\nmethod of doubt.\n\nDescartes presented his results in major works published during his\nlifetime: the Discourse on the Method (in French, 1637), with\nits essays, the Dioptrics, Meteorology, and\nGeometry; the Meditations on First Philosophy (i.e.,\non metaphysics), with its Objections and Replies (in Latin, 1641, 2nd\nedn. 1642); the Principles of Philosophy, covering his\nmetaphysics and much of his natural philosophy (in Latin, 1644); and\nthe Passions of the Soul, on the emotions (in French, 1649).\nWorks published posthumously included his Compendium of Music\n(in Latin, 1650), Letters (in Latin and French,\n1657\u201367); World, or Treatise on Light, containing the\ncore of his natural philosophy (in French, 1664); Treatise on\nMan (in French, 1664), containing his physiology and mechanistic\npsychology; and the Rules for the Direction of the Mind (in\nLatin, 1701), an early, unfinished work attempting to set out his\nmethod.\n\nDescartes\u2019 works have been variously received and valued. Among\nthe learned of his day he was considered to be a top mathematician,\nthe developer of a new and comprehensive physics or theory of nature\n(including living things), and the proposer of a new metaphysics. In\nthe years following his death, his natural philosophy was especially\nvalued and discussed. His works were invoked in debates over the\nequality of women. In the eighteenth century, aspects of his science\nremained influential, as did his project of investigating the\ncognitive capacities of the knower in assessing the possibility and\nextent of human knowledge. He was also remembered for his skeptical\narguments and for failing to provide a successful response to them in\nhis metaphysics. In the nineteenth century, he was revered for his\nmechanistic physiology and theory that animal bodies are machines (are\nconstituted by material mechanisms, governed by the laws of matter\nalone). The twentieth century variously celebrated his famous\n\u201ccogito\u201d starting point, reviled the sense data that some\nalleged to be the legacy of his skeptical starting point, and looked\nto him as a model of the culturally engaged philosopher. He has been\nvariously seen as a hero and a villain; as a brilliant theorist\nforging new directions in thought and as harbinger of a cold,\nrationalistic, and calculative conception of human beings. Those new\nto the study of Descartes should engage his own works in some detail\nprior to developing a view of his legacy.\n", "toc": [{"#InteBiog": "1.

Intellectual Biography\n1.1 Early life and education\n\nDescartes was born on 31 March 1596 in his maternal\ngrandmother\u2019s house in La Haye, in the Touraine region of\nFrance. His father Joachim, a lawyer who lived in Ch\u00e2tellerault\n(22 kilometers southwest of La Haye, across the Creuse River in the\nPoitou region), was away at the Parliament of Brittany in Rennes. The\ntown of La Haye, which lies 47 kilometers south of Tours, has\nsubsequently been renamed Descartes.\n\nWhen Descartes was thirteen and one-half months old, his mother,\nJeanne Brochard, died in childbirth. The young Ren\u00e9 spent his\nearly years with his grandmother, Jeanne Sain Brochard, in La Haye,\ntogether with his older brother Pierre and older sister Jeanne. It is\nlikely that he then moved to the house of his great uncle, Michel\nFerrand, who, like many of Ren\u00e9\u2019s male relatives, was a\nlawyer; he was a Counselor to the King and held the royal office of\nprovincial Lieutenant General in Ch\u00e2tellerault. When Descartes\nmet Isaac Beeckman in 1618, he introduced himself as\n\u201cPoitevin,\u201d or from Poitou (10:46, 51\u20134;\nRodis-Lewis 1998, 3, 26; see also 2:642). At this time (and\nnow and again later on), he also signed letters as \u201cdu\nPerron\u201d and called himself \u201csieur du Perron\u201d (Lord\nof Perron), after a small farm in Poitou he inherited from his\nmother\u2019s family (Watson 2007, 81, 230). But he did not neglect\nhis birthplace in La Haye: in a letter of 1649, he described himself\nas \u201ca man who was born in the gardens of Touraine\u201d\n(5:349).\n\nIn 1606 or 1607, Descartes, a Roman Catholic, entered the newly\nfounded Jesuit College of La Fl\u00e8che, where he remained until\n1614 or 1615. He followed the usual course of studies, which included\nfive or six years of grammar school, including Latin and Greek\ngrammar, classical poets, and Cicero, followed by three years of\nphilosophy curriculum. By rule, the Jesuit philosophy curriculum\nfollowed Aristotle; it was divided into the then-standard topics of\nlogic, morals, physics, and metaphysics. The Jesuits also included\nmathematics in the final three years of study.\n\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy was taught through textbooks and printed\ncommentaries on his works. Aristotle himself frequently discussed the\npositions of his ancient predecessors. The most extensive commentaries\nalso elaborated in some detail on positions other than\nAristotle\u2019s. Within this framework, and taking into account the\nreading of Cicero, Descartes would have been exposed in school to the\ndoctrines of the ancient atomists, Plato, and the Stoics, and he would\nhave heard of the skeptics. Further, important intellectual events\nwere celebrated at La Fl\u00e8che, including Galileo\u2019s\ndiscovery of the moons of Jupiter in 1610. Although scholastic\nAristotelian philosophy was dominant in Descartes\u2019 school years,\nit was not the only philosophy that he knew.\n\nFamously, Descartes wrote in the autobiographical portion of the\nDiscourse (1637) that, when he left school, \u201cI found\nmyself beset by so many doubts and errors that I came to think I had\ngained nothing from my attempts to become educated but increasing\nrecognition of my ignorance\u201d (6:4). And yet, he continued, he\ndid not \u201ccease to value the exercises done in the schools\u201d\n(6:5), for languages, fables, oratory, poetry, mathematics, morals,\ntheology, and philosophy all had their value, as did jurisprudence,\nmedicine, and other sciences (including engineering) that serve as\nprofessions and which one might study after attending a school such as\nLa Fl\u00e8che. He noted the contradiction and disagreement that\nbeset philosophy and so infected the higher sciences (including\nmedicine) \u201cinsofar as they borrow their principles from\nphilosophy\u201d (6:8). A year later, in 1638, he told an inquiring\nfather that \u201cnowhere on earth is philosophy taught better than\nat La Fl\u00e8che,\u201d where he advised his correspondent to send\nhis son even if he wanted him subsequently to transcend the learning\nof the schools\u2014while also suggesting that the son might study at\nUtrecht with Henry le Roy, a disciple of Descartes (2:378\u20139).\nAccording to the Discourse, it was not surprising that\nphilosophy as taught at La Fl\u00e8che was uncertain: it had to be,\nsince he (Descartes) was now offering a first glimpse of the one true\nphilosophy, only recently discovered. Until it could be promulgated,\nLa Fl\u00e8che, or another good school, would do.\n\nHis family wanted Descartes to be a lawyer, like his father and other\nrelatives. To this end, he obtained a law degree from Poitiers in\n1616. But he never practiced law or entered into the governmental\nservice that such practice would have made possible (Rodis-Lewis 1998,\n18\u201322). Instead, he became a gentleman soldier, moving in 1618\nto Breda, to support the Protestant Prince Maurice against the\nCatholic parts of the Netherlands (which later constituted Belgium),\nwhich were controlled by Spain\u2014a Catholic land, like France, but\nat this point an enemy.\n1.2 First results, a new mission, and method\n\nWhile in Breda, Descartes met Isaac Beeckman, a Dutch mathematician\nand natural philosopher. Beeckman set various problems for Descartes,\nincluding questions about falling bodies, hydrostatics, and\nmathematics. Descartes and Beeckman engaged in what they called\n\u201cphysico-mathematica,\u201d or mathematical physics\n(Beeckman\u2019s journal, in Descartes, 10:52). Since\nantiquity, mathematics had been applied to various physical subject\nmatters, in optics, astronomy, mechanics (focusing on the lever), and\nhydrostatics. Beeckman and Descartes brought to this work a commitment\nto atoms as the basic constituents of matter. As had ancient atomists,\nthey attributed not only size, shape, and motion but also weight to\nthose atoms (10:68). Descartes opened a section in his\nnotebook entitled \u201cDemocritica\u201d (10:8), in honor\nof the ancient atomist Democritus.\n\nPerhaps at this time, though certainly by 1628, Descartes had the\nfundamental insight that makes analytic geometry possible: the\ntechnique for describing lines of various sorts by using mathematical\nequations involving ratios between lengths in relation to coordinate\nlines. (Descartes did not require that the lines be perpendicular to\none another.) Descartes himself did not foresee replacing geometrical\nconstructions with algebraic formulas; rather, he viewed geometry as\nthe basic mathematical science and he considered his algebraic\ntechniques to provide an extension beyond compass-and-ruler\nconstructions. When the right-angled coordinate system of algebraic\ngeometry was subsequently developed, the name \u201cCartesian\ncoordinates\u201d honored Descartes\u2019 discovery. (See Boyer\n1968, Ch. 17, Shea 1991, Ch. 3, and, more generally, Domski 2022.)\n\nDescartes left Breda in 1619 to join the Catholic army of Maximilian I\n(Duke of Bavaria and ally of France). The war concerned the authority\nof Ferdinand II, a Catholic, who in September had been crowned emperor\nof the Holy Roman Empire (located in Central Europe and including\nAustria and parts of northern Italy). Descartes attended the\ncoronation and was returning to the army when winter caught him in the\nsmall town of Ulm (or perhaps Neuburg), not far from Munich. On the\nnight of 10 November 1619, he had three dreams that seemed to provide\nhim with a mission in life. The dreams themselves are interesting and\ncomplex (see Sebba 1987). Descartes took from them the message that he\nshould set out to reform all knowledge. He decided to begin with\nphilosophy, since the principles of the other sciences must be derived\nfrom it (Disc. II, 6:21\u20132).\n\nDescartes was familiar with both mainstream philosophy and recent\ninnovators (those who, among other things, rejected aspects of\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy), from both his schooling and from\nreading he undertook from 1620 on. In 1640, he recalled\n(Corr. 3:185) having read various works in philosophy around\nthe year 1620, written by well-known Jesuit commentators on Aristotle:\nFrancisco Toledo (1532\u201396), Antonio Rubio (1548\u20131615), and\nthe Coimbran commentators (active ca. 1600). He also recalled an\nabstract or summary of \u201cthe whole of scholastic\nphilosophy\u201d by Eustace of Saint Paul (1573\u20131640), whose\nSumma Philosophiae was first published in 1609. In 1638, he\nrecalled having read Thomas Campanella\u2019s De Sensu Rerum\n(1620) about fifteen years before, and not being much impressed\n(2:659\u201360). And in 1630 he was able to rattle off the names of\nrecent innovators in philosophy (1:158), including Campanella\n(1568\u20131639), Bernardino Telesio (1509\u201388), Giordano Bruno\n(1548\u20131600), Lucilio Vanini (1585\u20131619), and\nS\u00e9bastien Basson (b. ca. 1573). From these sources, he would\nhave acquired basic philosophical concepts, such as the notion that\nsubstances are characterized by essences that determine which\nproperties they must have in order to be what they are (an\nAristotelian concept). He would also have seen first attempts, among\nthe innovators, of reviving atomism, or of challenging the notion of\nsubstantial forms (see Sec. 1.3).\n\nDescartes\u2019 activities during the early 1620s are not\nwell-documented. He was in France part of the time, visiting Poitou to\nsell some inherited properties in 1622 and visiting Paris. He also\nwent to Italy (1623\u201325). Upon his return he lived in Paris,\nwhere he was in touch with mathematicians and natural philosophers in\nthe circle of his long-time friend and correspondent Marin Mersenne\n(1588\u20131648). While in Paris, he worked on some mathematical\nproblems and derived the sine law of refraction, which facilitated his\nwork on formulating mathematically the shapes of lenses (later\npublished in the Dioptrics). His major philosophical effort\nduring these years was on the Rules.\n\nIn the Rules, he sought to generalize the methods of\nmathematics so as to provide a route to clear knowledge of everything\nthat human beings can know. His methodological advice included a\nsuggestion that is familiar to students of elementary geometry: break\nyour work up into small steps that you can understand completely and\nabout which you have utter certainty, and check your work often. But\nhe also had advice for the ambitious seeker of truth, concerning where\nto start and how to work up to greater things. Thus, Rule 10 reads:\n\u201cIn order to acquire discernment we should exercise our\nintelligence by investigating what others have already discovered, and\nmethodically survey even the most insignificant products of human\nskill, especially those which display order\u201d (10:403). As\nexamples of \u201csimple\u201d arts \u201cin which order\nprevails\u201d (10:404), he offered carpet-making and embroidery, and\nalso number-games and arithmetic games. He went on to discuss the\nroles of the \u201ccognitive faculties\u201d in acquiring knowledge,\nwhich include the intellect, imagination, sense perception, and\nmemory. These faculties allow the seeker of knowledge to combine\nsimple truths in order to solve complex problems as found in optics\n(10:394) or to discover how a magnet works (10:427).\n\nBy the end of 1628, Descartes abandoned work on the Rules,\nhaving completed about half of the projected treatise. He moved to the\nDutch Netherlands, returning to France only infrequently prior to\nmoving to Sweden in 1649. While in the Netherlands, he tried to keep\nhis address secret and changed locations often, according to his\nmotto, \u201cwho lives well hidden, lives well\u201d (1:286*).\n1.3 Metaphysical turn, comprehensive physics, Discourse\n\nDescartes spent his first year in the Netherlands in Franeker, where\nhe registered at the University in April, 1629. Initially, he worked\non two topics: mathematical science and metaphysics. In Summer, 1629,\nan impressive set of parhelia, or false suns, were observed near Rome.\nWhen Descartes heard of them, he set out to find an explanation. (He\nultimately hypothesized that a large, solid ice-ring in the sky acts\nas a lens to form multiple images of the sun [Met.\n6:355].)\n\nThis work interrupted his investigations on another topic, which had\nengaged him for his first nine months in the Netherlands\n(1:44)\u2014the topic of metaphysics. The metaphysical objects of his\ninvestigation included the existence and nature of God and the soul\n(1:144, 182). However, these metaphysical investigations were not\nentirely divorced from problems such as the parhelia, for he claimed\nthat through his investigations into God and the human self, he had\nbeen able \u201cto discover the foundation of physics\u201d (1:144).\nHis post-Rules emphasis on intellectual apprehension of God,\nthe soul, and the foundations of physics constitute Descartes\u2019\n\u201cmetaphysical turn,\u201d even if his metaphysics was not yet\nfully disclosed. Subsequently, Descartes mentioned a little\nmetaphysical treatise in Latin\u2014presumably an early version of\nthe Meditations\u2014that he wrote upon first coming to the\nNetherlands (1:184, 350). And he later affirmed to Mersenne that the\nmetaphysics of the Meditations, in which God and soul are\nprominent, contained \u201call the principles of my physics\u201d\n(3:233).\n\nWhile working on the parhelia, Descartes conceived the idea for a very\nambitious treatise, about which he wrote Mersenne on 16 November 1629\nfrom his new residence in Amsterdam. He now intended to explain not\n\u201cjust one phenomenon\u201d (the parhelia), but \u201call the\nphenomena of nature, that is to say, the whole of physics\u201d\n(1:70). This work eventually became The World, which was to\nhave three parts: on light (a general treatise on visible, or\nmaterial, nature), on man (a treatise on physiology), and on the soul.\nOnly the first two survive (and perhaps only they were ever written),\nas the Treatise on Light and Treatise on Man. In\nthese works, which Descartes decided to suppress upon learning of the\ncondemnation of Galileo (1:270, 305), he offered a comprehensive\nvision of the universe as constituted from bare matter possessing the\nproperties length, breadth, and depth (three-dimensional volume) and\ncarved up into particles with size and shape, which may be in motion\nor at rest, and which interact through quantitative laws of motion\nthat are formulated and sustained by God (Light,\n11:33\u20134). These works described the visible universe as a single\nphysical system in which all operations, from the formation of planets\nand the transmission of light from the sun to the physiological\nprocesses of human and nonhuman animal bodies, can be explained\nthrough the mechanism of matter arranged into shapes and structures\nand moving according to three laws of motion. In fact, his\nexplanations in the World and the subsequent\nPrinciples made little use of the three laws of motion in\nother than a qualitative manner. The laws sustained the notion that\nmatter moves regularly (in a straight line) and that upon impact bits\nof matter alter their motions in regular ways\u2014something that\nhappens constantly in the full universe (the \u201cplenum\u201d)\nconceived by Descartes. (At this time, Descartes received an offer of\nappointment to the medical faculty in Bologna\u2014even though he had\nnot yet made public any of his results\u2014which he declined; see\nManning 2014.)\n\nAfter suppressing his World, Descartes decided to put\nforward, anonymously, a limited sample of his new philosophy, in the\nDiscourse with its attached essays. The Discourse\nrecounted Descartes\u2019 own life journey, explaining how he had\ncome to the position of doubting his previous knowledge and seeking to\nbegin afresh. It offered some initial results of his metaphysical\ninvestigations, including mind\u2013body dualism. It did not,\nhowever, engage in the deep skepticism of the later\nMeditations, nor did it claim to establish, metaphysically,\nthat the essence of matter is extension. This last conclusion was\npresented merely as a hypothesis whose fruitfulness could be tested\nand \u201cproven,\u201d or perhaps merely confirmed (see McMullin\n2008), by the results contained in the attached essays on\nDioptrics and Meteorology (the latter covering\n\u201catmospheric\u201d phenomena).\n\nIn his Meteorology, Descartes described his general\nhypothesis (or supposition) about the nature of matter, before\noffering accounts of vapors, salt, winds, clouds, snow, rain, hail,\nlightning, the rainbow, coronas, and parhelia. His hypothesis was as\nfollows:\n\n\nthat the water, earth, air, and all other such bodies that surround us\nare composed of many small parts of various shapes and sizes, which\nare never so properly disposed nor so exactly joined together that\nthere do not remain many intervals around them; and that these\nintervals are not empty but are filled with that extremely subtle\nmatter through the mediation of which, I have said above, the action\nof light is communicated. (6:233)\n\n\nHe presented a corpuscularian basis for his physics that denied the\natoms-and-void theory of ancient atomism and affirmed that all bodies\nare composed from one type of matter, which is infinitely divisible\ninto particles or corpuscles (6:239). He here also proclaimed that his\nnatural philosophy had no need for the \u201csubstantial forms\u201d\nand \u201creal qualities\u201d that other philosophers (i.e.,\nAristotelians) \u201cimagine to be in bodies\u201d (6:239). He had\ntaken the same position in the Treatise on Light, where he\nsaid that in conceiving his new \u201cworld\u201d (i.e., his\nconception of the universe), \u201cI do not use the qualities called\nheat, cold, moistness, and dryness, as the Philosophers do\u201d\n(11:25).\n\nIn effect, he was denying the then-dominant scholastic Aristotelian\nontology, which explained all natural bodies as comprised of a\n\u201cprime matter\u201d informed by a \u201csubstantial\nform,\u201d and which explained qualities such as hot and cold as\nreally inhering in bodies in a way that is \u201csimilar\u201d to\nthe qualities of hot and cold as we experience them tactually.\nAccording to the Aristotelian explanation, the qualities that are\nproper to each sense\u2014color, sound, odor, tastes, and tactual\nqualities\u2014are really inherent in things, and our experienced\nsensations resemble these qualities in things. As regards prime\nmatter, many scholastic Aristotelians held that it cannot exist on its\nown; to form a substance, or something that can exist by itself, prime\nmatter must be \u201cinformed\u201d by a substantial form (a form or\nactive principle that gives a substance its essential properties). The\nfour Aristotelian elements, earth, air, fire, and water, had\nsubstantial forms that combined the basic qualities of hot, cold, wet,\nand dry: earth is cold and dry; air is hot and wet; fire is hot and\ndry; and water is cold and wet. These elements can themselves then\nserve as \u201cmatter\u201d to higher substantial forms, such as the\nform of a mineral, or a magnet, or a living thing. Whether in the case\nof earth or of a living thing, such as a rabbit, the\n\u201cform\u201d of a thing directs its characteristic activity. For\nearth, that activity is to approach the center of the universe; water\nhas the same tendency, but not as strongly. Accordingly, Aristotelians\nexplained, the planet earth exists at the center, with water on its\nsurface. A new rabbit is formed when a male rabbit contributes,\nthrough its seed-matter, the \u201cform\u201d of rabbithood to the\nseed-matter of the female rabbit. This form then organizes that matter\ninto the shape of a rabbit, including its various organs and\nphysiological processes. The newborn rabbit\u2019s behavior is guided\nby its \u201csensitive soul,\u201d a rabbit-specific instance of the\ntype of substantial form possessed by all animals. Other properties of\nthe rabbit, such as the whiteness of its fur, are explained by the\n\u201creal quality\u201d of white inhering in each strand of\nhair.\n\nAlthough in the World and Meteorology Descartes\navoided outright denial of substantial forms and real qualities, it is\nclear that he intended to deny them (Corr. 1:324; 2:200;\n3:420, 500, 648). Indeed, he claimed that he could explain these\nqualities themselves through matter in motion (Light 11:26,\nMet. 6:235\u20136). As an example, he explained color in\nthings as a property of surfaces that puts a spin on particles of\nlight, which in turn affect the nerves in the retina, which then\naffect the brain, causing a sensation in the mind (via matter\u2019s\neffect on the immaterial mind). The sensation of a color (such as red)\ndoes not resemble the surface property that causes the effect on the\nnerve that produces the sensation. The experienced red is an\napparently arbitrary sign or signal for a surface property in objects\n(Light I; see also Dioptrics VI, 6:130, and\nPrinc. I.68\u201370).\n\nTwo considerations help explain Descartes\u2019 tentative language\nwith respect to substantial forms and real qualities. First, when he\nwrote these works in the 1630s, he was not yet prepared to release his\nmetaphysics, which would support his hypothesis about matter and so\nrule out substantial forms (1:563). Second, he was sensitive to the\nprudential value of not directly attacking the scholastic Aristotelian\nposition (3:298), since it was the accepted position in university\neducation (3:577) and was strongly supported by orthodox theologians,\nboth Catholic and Protestant (1:85\u20136; 3:349).\n\nAfter the Discourse appeared in 1637, Descartes received\nletters with queries and challenges to various of the doctrines,\nincluding: his avoidance of substantial forms and real qualities; his\nargument for a distinction between mind and body; and his view that\nnatural philosophical hypotheses could be \u201cproven\u201d (or\nconfirmed) through the empirically observed effects they explain\n(Disc. VI, 6:76). This correspondence merits close study, for\nhis further discussions of hypothesis-confirmation in science\n(Corr. 1:422\u20134, 563\u20134, 2:142\u20133,\n199\u2013201), his replies to objections concerning his metaphysics\n(1:350, 353), and his explanation that he had left the most radical\nskeptical arguments out of this work, since it was written in French\nfor a wide audience, including women (1:350, 561).\n\nIn 1635, Descartes fathered a daughter named Francine. Her mother was\nDescartes\u2019 housekeeper, Helena Jans. They lived with Descartes\npart of the time in the latter 1630s. He was arranging for the\ndaughter to live with a female relative of his for the sake of her\neducation when he learned of her death in September 1640, which\nsaddened him greatly (Rodis-Lewis 1998, 140). Subsequently, in 1644,\nhe contributed a dowry for Helena\u2019s marriage (Watson 2007,\n188).\n1.4 The metaphysics and comprehensive physics revealed\n\nIn a letter of 13 November 1639, Descartes wrote to Mersenne that he\nwas \u201cworking on a discourse in which I try to clarify what I\nhave hitherto written\u201d on metaphysics (2:622). This was the\nMeditations, and presumably he was revising or recasting the\nLatin treatise from 1629 and elaborating on Discourse IV. He\ntold Mersenne of his plan to provide the work to \u201cthe twenty or\nthirty most learned theologians\u201d so as to gauge their responses\nbefore publication. Ultimately, he and Mersenne collected seven sets\nof objections to the Meditations, which Descartes published\nwith the work, along with his replies (1641, 1642). Some objections\nwere from unnamed theologians, passed on by Mersenne; one set came\nfrom the Dutch priest Johannes Caterus; one set was from the Jesuit\nphilosopher Pierre Bourdin; others were from Mersenne himself, from\nthe philosophers Pierre Gassendi and Thomas Hobbes, and from the\nCatholic philosopher-theologian Antoine Arnauld.\n\nRecall that Descartes considered the Meditations to contain\nthe principles of his physics. But there is no Meditation labeled\n\u201cprinciples of physics.\u201d The principles in question, which\nare spread through the work, concern the nature of matter, the\nactivity of God in creating and conserving the world, the nature of\nmind (that it is an unextended, thinking substance), mind\u2013body\nunion and interaction, and the ontology of sensory qualities.\n\nOnce Descartes had presented his metaphysics, he felt free to move\nbeyond the published samples of his physics and to present the whole\nof his conception of nature. But he needed first \u201cto teach it to\nspeak Latin\u201d (3:523), the lingua franca of the seventeenth\ncentury (recall that his World was in French). He hatched a\nscheme to publish a Latin version of his physics (the\nPrinciples) accompanied by a scholastic Aristotelian work on\nphysics, so as to make the comparative advantages manifest. He chose\nthe Summa philosophiae of Eustace of St. Paul. That part of\nhis plan never came to fruition. His intent remained the same: he\nwished to produce a book that could be adopted in the schools, even\nJesuit schools such as La Fl\u00e8che (3:233, 523; 4:224).\nUltimately, his physics was taught in the Netherlands, France,\nEngland, and parts of Germany. For the Catholic lands, the teaching of\nhis philosophy was dampened when his works were placed on the Index of\nProhibited Books in 1663, although his followers in France, such as\nJacques Rohault (1618\u201372) and Pierre Regis (1632\u20131707),\ncontinued to promote Descartes\u2019 natural philosophy.\n\nThe Principles appeared in Latin in 1644, with a French\ntranslation in 1647. Descartes added to the translation an\n\u201cAuthor\u2019s Letter\u201d as a preface. The letter explained\nimportant aspects of his attitude toward philosophy, including the\nview that, in matters philosophical, one must reason through the\narguments and evaluate them for one\u2019s self (9B:3). He also\npresented an image of the relations among the various parts of\nphilosophy, in the form of a tree:\n\nThus the whole of philosophy is like a tree. The roots are\nmetaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the\ntrunk are all the other sciences, which may be reduced to three\nprincipal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals. By\n\u201cmorals\u201d I understand the highest and most perfect moral\nsystem, which presupposes a complete knowledge of the other sciences\nand is the ultimate level of wisdom. (9B:14)\n\n\nThe extant Principles offers metaphysics in Part I; the\ngeneral principles of physics, in the form of his matter theory and\nlaws of motion, as following from the metaphysics, in Part II; Part\nIII concerns astronomical phenomena; and Part IV covers the formation\nof the earth and seeks to explain the properties of minerals, metals,\nmagnets, fire, and the like, to which are appended discussions of how\nthe senses operate and a final discussion of methodological issues in\nnatural philosophy. His intent had been also to explain in depth the\norigins of plants and animals, human physiology, mind\u2013body union\nand interaction, and the function of the senses. (Descartes and his\nfollowers variously included topics concerning the nature of the mind\nand mind\u2013body interaction within physics or natural philosophy,\non which, see Hatfield 2000.) In the end, he had to abandon the\ndiscussion of plants and animals (Princ. IV.188), but he\nincluded some discussion of mind\u2013body union in his abbreviated\naccount of the senses.\n1.5 Theological controversy, Passions, and death\n\nFrom early in his correspondence with Mersenne, Descartes expressed\nconcern to avoid becoming embroiled in theological controversy or\nearning the enmity of church authorities (1:85\u20136, 150, 271).\nAside from such prudential concerns, he strictly separated theological\ndoctrines based in faith (e.g., the trinity) from his claims about God\nbased solely in reason (Corr. 1:44, 150, 153; 4:117).\nDescartes was a Roman Catholic, but it is clear that the God of his\nmetaphysics is nondenominational, tending toward the deistic. If\nDescartes were fully consistent, he would make no claims about\nGod\u2019s plans or his Providential acts and there would be no\nmiracles in his world (Light VII, 11:48; Princ.\nIII.2\u20133; see also Corr. 2:558, 3:214).\n\nDespite his precautions, he was drawn into theological controversy\nwith the Jesuits over Bourdin\u2019s set of objections, which led him\nto write to Father Dinet, Bourdin\u2019s superior, to allay any fears\nthat Descartes\u2019 philosophy caused theological difficulty\n(7:581). He was also drawn into theological controversy with Calvinist\ntheologians in the Netherlands. In the latter 1630s, Henry le Roy\n(1598\u20131679), or Regius, a professor of medicine in Utrecht,\ntaught Descartes\u2019 system of natural philosophy. Already by 1640,\nGisbertus Voetius (1589\u20131676), a theologian at Utrecht,\nexpressed his displeasure over this to Mersenne (3:230). Controversy\nbrewed, and Descartes included an attack on Voetius in the Letter to\nDinet. Voetius, as rector of the University, convinced the faculty\nsenate to condemn Descartes\u2019 (and Regius\u2019) philosophy in\n1642. He and his colleagues attacked Descartes in disputations in 1642\nand in a book by Martin Schoock (1643), to which Descartes responded\nwith a Letter to Voetius (1643). The controversy simmered.\nDescartes eventually fell out with Regius, who published a broadsheet\nmanifesto that deviated from Descartes\u2019 theory of the human\nmind. Descartes replied with his Comments on a Certain\nBroadsheet (1648). In 1648 he drafted a further response to\nongoing attacks by Voetius, ultimately published in 1656 (Querela\napologetica).\n\nIn the mid-1640s, Descartes continued work on his physiological\nsystem, which he had pursued throughout the 1630s. He allowed the\nunpublished manuscript of the Treatise on Man to be copied\n(4:566\u20137) and he began a new work (5:112), Description of\nthe Human Body, in which he sought to explain the embryonic\ndevelopment of animal bodies. During this period he corresponded with\nPrincess Elisabeth of Bohemia (daughter of Frederick V, a Protestant,\nand briefly King of Bohemia), now living in the Netherlands, at first\non metaphysical topics from the Meditations and then on the\npassions and emotions. Eventually, he wrote the Passions of the\nSoul (1649), a comprehensive and original theory of the passions\nand emotions that presented the most extensive account of his\nbehavioral physiology published during his lifetime.\n\nIn 1649, Descartes accepted the invitation of Queen Christina of\nSweden to join her court. At her request, he composed the Statutes of\nthe Swedish Royal Academy. On the day he gave them to her, he became\nill. He never recovered, and died on 11 February 1650. (On\nDescartes\u2019 intellectual biography, see Clarke 2006, Gaukroger\n1995, and Rodis-Lewis 1998.)\n2. Philosophical Development\n\nIn general, it is rare for a philosopher\u2019s positions and\narguments to remain the same across an entire life. This means that,\nin reading philosophers\u2019 works and reconstructing their\narguments, one must pay attention to the place of each work in the\nphilosophical development of the author. Readers of Immanuel Kant are\naware of the basic distinction between his critical and precritical\nperiods. Readers of G. W. Leibniz are also aware of his philosophical\ndevelopment, although in his case there is less agreement on a\ndevelopmental scheme.\n\nScholars have proposed various schemes for dividing Descartes\u2019\nlife into periods. This entry adopts a relatively simple division\nbetween the era when mathematics provided the model for his method (in\nthe Rules) and the period after the \u201cmetaphysical\nturn\u201d of 1629, when his conception of the role of the intellect\nin acquiring knowledge changed to privilege purely intellectual\nintuitions. At this time, he also recognized that the truth of his\nspecial or particular hypotheses in natural philosophy was less than\ncertain and so was subject to confirmation through consequences (as\nmentioned in Sec. 1.3, above). In effect, he adopted what is now\ncalled a hypothetico-deductive scheme of confirmation, but with this\ndifference: the range of hypotheses was limited by his metaphysical\nconclusions concerning the essences of mind and matter, their union,\nand the role of God in creating and conserving the universe.\nConsequently, some hypotheses, such as the \u201csubstantial\nforms\u201d of the scholastics, were ruled out. Argumentative\ndifferences among the World, Discourse, and\nMeditations and Principles may then be ascribed to\nthe fact that, in the 1630s, Descartes had not yet presented his full\nmetaphysics and so adopted an empirical mode of justification for even\nthe first principles of his physics, whereas, after 1641, he appealed\nto his published metaphysics in securing those principles.\n\nOther scholars see things differently. John Schuster (1980) finds that\nthe epistemology of the Rules lasted into the 1630s and was\nsuperseded (unhappily, in his view) only by the metaphysical quest for\ncertainty of the Meditations. Daniel Garber (1992, 48) also\nholds that Descartes abandoned his early method only after the\nDiscourse. In contrast, Peter Machamer and J. E. McGuire\n(2006) believe that Descartes held natural philosophy to the standard\nof absolute certainty through the Meditations but admitted\ndefeat on that score at the end of Principles IV, adopting a\nlower standard of certainty for his particular hypotheses (such as the\nexplanation of magnetism by corkscrew-shaped particles). They see the\nPrinciples as marking Descartes\u2019 \u201cepistemic\nturn\u201d away from the methodological stance of realism about\nintuitive knowledge of substances that they find in the\nRules, Discourse, and Meditations.\n\nSome scholars who emphasize epistemology find that the main change in\nDescartes\u2019 intellectual development is the introduction of\nskeptical arguments in the Discourse and\nMeditations. Some interpreters, perhaps inspired by Richard\nPopkin (1979), believe that Descartes took the skeptical threat to\nknowledge quite seriously and sought to overcome it in the\nMeditations (e.g., Curley 1978). By contrast, in the\ninterpretive thread followed here, skeptical arguments were a\ncognitive tool used to guide the reader of the Meditations\ninto the correct cognitive frame of mind for grasping the first truths\nof metaphysics. An answer to skepticism was a side-effect of this\nfundamental aim.\n\nOther views of Descartes\u2019 development have arisen from new\nattention to the biological and physiological dimensions of his\nthought. A key element is Descartes\u2019 fascination with mechanical\nautomata and his use of the notion of a machine in characterizing\nliving things (Man 11:119\u201320, 130\u201331;\nMed. VI, 7:84). Here again the fundamental change occurs just\nafter the Rules; it is not a \u201cmetaphysical turn\u201d\nbut a turn toward automata as models for human and animal behavior.\nThese interpretations connect with Descartes\u2019 new theory of\nperception (Ben-Yami 2015) or his investigation of ordinary objects\nand living things as coherent unities (Brown and Normore 2019; see\nalso Des Chene 2001).\n3. A New Metaphysics and Epistemology\n\nDescartes presented his metaphysics first in the Meditations\nand then, in textbook-format, in Principles I. His\nmetaphysics sought to answer such questions as: How does the human\nmind acquire knowledge? What is the mark of truth? What is the actual\nnature of reality? How are our mental experiences related to our\nbodies and brains? Is there a benevolent God, and if so, how can we\nreconcile his existence with the facts of illness, error, and immoral\nactions?\n3.1 How do our minds know?\n\nDescartes had no doubt that human beings know some things and are\ncapable of discovering others, including (at least since his\nmetaphysical insights of 1629) fundamental truths about the basic\nstructure of reality. Yet he also believed that the philosophical\nmethods taught in the schools and used by most of his contemporaries\nwere deeply flawed. Accordingly, the doctrines of scholastic\nAristotelian philosophy contained a basic error about how fundamental\ntruths, such as those in metaphysics, are obtained. He articulated\nthis error in the First Meditation, by saying (not in his own voice,\nbut in that of the reader): \u201cWhatever I have up till now\naccepted as most true I have acquired either from the senses or\nthrough the senses\u201d (7:18). He then challenged the veridicality\nof the senses with the skeptical arguments of the First Meditation,\nincluding the dream argument (that we might experience sensory images\nwhile dreaming that are indistinguishable from waking experience) and\nthe argument that a deceptive God or an evil deceiver is causing our\nsensory experience or causes us to err even when reasoning.\n\nIn the Aristotelian scheme against which Descartes was moving, all\nknowledge arises through the senses, in accordance with the slogan\n\u201cThere is nothing in the intellect that was not previously in\nthe senses\u201d (7:75, 267). Similarly, orthodox scholastic\nAristotelians agreed that there is \u201cno thought without a\nphantasm,\u201d or an image. Descartes explained these convictions as\nthe results of childhood prejudice (7:2, 17, 69, 107; Princ.\nI.71\u20133). As children, we are naturally led by our senses in\nseeking benefits and avoiding bodily harms. As a result, when we grow\ninto adults we are \u201cimmersed\u201d in the body and the senses,\nand so we accept the philosophical view that the senses reveal the\nnature of reality (7:38, 75, 82\u20133).\n\nAlthough Descartes ultimately accepted the senses as a source of some\nkinds of knowledge, he denied that they reveal the natures of\nsubstances (7:83). Rather, the human intellect perceives the nature of\nreality through purely intellectual perception. This means that, in\norder to procure the fundamental truths of metaphysics, we must\n\u201cwithdraw the mind from the senses\u201d (7:4, 12, 14) and turn\ntoward our innate ideas of the essences of things, including the\nessences of mind, matter, and an infinite being (God). Descartes\nconstructed the Meditations so as to secure this process of\nwithdrawal from the senses in Meditation I. Meditation II discovers an\ninitial truth, the cogito (7:25), elsewhere summarized as the\nargument \u201ccogito, ergo sum,\u201d or \u201cI think, therefore\nI am\u201d (7:140). The cogito result is known with\ncertainty because it is \u201cclearly and distinctly\u201d perceived\nby the intellect (7:35). Clear and distinct intellectual perception,\nindependent of the senses, is, then, the mark of truth (7:35, 62,\n73).\n\nDescartes unfolds a sequence of clear and distinct perception in\nMeditations III\u2013VI and again in Principles I\u2013II.\nWe consider these results in Secs. 3.3\u20133.5. For now, let us\nexamine Descartes\u2019 thoughts about the senses as a source of\nknowledge, different from pure intellect.\n\nDescartes\u2019 conclusion in Meditation VI that the senses do not\nreveal the \u201cessential nature\u201d of external objects (7:83)\ndiffers from his position in the Rules. In that work, he\nallowed that some \u201csimple natures\u201d pertaining to corporeal\nthings can be known through the images of the senses (10:383, 417). In\nthe Meditations, he held that the essence of matter is\napprehended by innate ideas, independently of any sensory image\n(7:64\u20135, 72\u20133). To that extent, his position\npost-Rules agrees with the Platonic tradition in philosophy.\nBut Plato denigrated the senses as a source of knowledge. Descartes\nwas not a full-blown Platonist in that he did not totally disparage\nsensory knowledge.\n\nDescartes assigned two roles to the senses in the acquisition of human\nknowledge. First, he acknowledged that the senses are usually adequate\nfor detecting benefits and harms for the body. Their natural function\nis \u201cto inform the mind of what is beneficial or harmful for the\ncomposite of which the mind is a part\u201d (7:83), that is, for the\ncomposite of mind and body. Here, he adopted a widely held conception\nof sensory function within natural philosophy, also found in the\nAristotelian and medical literatures.\n\nSecond, he acknowledged an essential role for the senses in natural\nphilosophy. Older interpretive literature sometimes has Descartes\nclaiming to derive all natural philosophical or scientific knowledge\nfrom the pure intellect, independent of the senses. But Descartes knew\nfull well that he could not do that. He distinguished between the\ngeneral principles of his physics and the more particular mechanisms\nby which he explained natural phenomena such as magnetism or the\nproperties of oil and water. He claimed to derive the general\nprinciples \u201cfrom certain seeds of truth\u201d that are innate\nin the mind (Disc. 6:64). These include the fundamental\ndoctrine that the essence of matter is extension (Princ.\nII.3\u20134, IV.203). For particular phenomena, he relied on\nobservations to determine their properties (such as the properties of\nthe magnet), and he acknowledged that multiple hypotheses about\nsubvisible mechanisms could be constructed to account for those\nphenomena. The natural philosopher must, therefore, test the various\nhypotheses by their consequences, and consider empirical virtues such\nas simplicity and scope (Disc. VI; Princ.\nIV.201\u20136). Further, Descartes knew that some problems require\nmeasurements that rely on the senses, including determining the size\nof the sun (Med. 7:80, Princ. III.5\u20136) or the\nrefractive indexes of various materials (Met. VIII).\n\nAlthough Descartes recognized an important role for the senses in\nnatural philosophy, he limited that role by comparison with\nAristotelian epistemology. Many scholastic Aristotelians held that all\nintellectual content arises through a process of intellectual\nabstraction that starts from sensory images found in the faculty of\nimagination. Mathematical objects are formed by abstraction from such\nimages. Even metaphysics rests on knowledge derived by abstraction\nfrom images. Of course, they held that the intellect plays a crucial\nrole in abstracting mathematical objects or the essences of natural\nthings. By contrast, Descartes affirmed that the truths of mathematics\nand metaphysics are grasped by the pure intellect operating\nindependently of the senses and without assistance from the\nimagination.\n\nAs regards knowledge, Descartes accepted that in order to know\nsomething you must not only represent it as true (e.g., \u201cthe\nessence of matter is extension\u201d), but you must also affirm its\ntruth and do so with some justification. In his scheme of mental\ncapacities, the intellect, as the faculty of representation, offers\ncontent for judgment. A second mental faculty, the will (Med.\nIV, Princ. I.32\u20134), affirms or denies the truth of that\ncontent (e.g., asserts that the essence of matter is extension).\n\nNot all content deriving from the intellectual faculty is\n\u201cpure.\u201d Purely intellectual content arises from innate\nideas without any accompanying brain processes. Other intellectual\nacts require the presence of the body: sense perception, imagination,\nand corporeal (body-involving) memory. The content of these acts is\nless clear and distinct than that of pure intellect, and may indeed be\nobscure and confused (as in the case of color sensations).\nNonetheless, the will can affirm or deny such intellectual content.\nWith clear and distinct purely intellectual perceptions, the will is\njustified in affirming their truth. (As discussed in the next\nsubsection, no error can arise in these judgments.) For lesser degrees\nof clarity and distinctness, care must be taken in what the will\naffirms (Med. IV, Princ. I.66\u201370,\nIV.205\u20136). (See Newman 2019.)\n\nIn sum, in considering Descartes\u2019 answer to how we know, classes\nof knowledge differ in the degree of expected certainty. Metaphysical\nfirst principles as known by the intellect acting alone should attain\nabsolute certainty. Practical knowledge concerning immediate benefits\nand harms is known by the senses. Such knowledge needn\u2019t attain\nabsolute certainty; even so, it is usually accurate enough. Objects of\nnatural science are known by a combination of pure intellect and\nsensory observation: the pure intellect tells us what properties\nbodies can have, and we use the senses to determine which particular\ninstances of those properties bodies do have. For submicroscopic\nparticles, we must reason from observed effects to potential cause. In\nthese cases, our measurements and our inferences may be subject to\nerror, but with care we may hope to arrive at the truth.\n3.2 The mark of truth and the circle\n\nAt the beginning of the Third Meditation, Descartes declares \u201cI\nnow seem to be able to lay it down as a general rule that whatever I\nperceive very clearly and distinctly is true\u201d (7:35). Clarity\nand distinctness of intellectual perception is the mark of truth.\n\nIn the fifth set of Objections to the Meditations, Gassendi\nsuggests that there is difficulty concerning\n\nwhat possible skill or method will permit us to discover that our\nunderstanding is so clear and distinct as to be true and to make it\nimpossible that we should be mistaken. As I objected at the beginning,\nwe are often deceived even though we think we know something as\nclearly and distinctly as anything can possibly be known. (7:318)\n\n\nGassendi has in effect asked how it is that we should recognize clear\nand distinct perceptions. If clarity and distinctness is the mark of\ntruth, what is the method for recognizing clarity and\ndistinctness?\n\nIn reply, Descartes claims that he has already supplied such a method\n(7:379). What could he have in mind? It cannot be the simple belief\nthat one has attained clarity and distinctness, for Descartes\nacknowledges that individuals can be wrong in that belief (7:35, 361).\nHe offers this criterion: we have a clear and distinct perception of\nsomething if, when we consider it, we cannot doubt it (7:145). That\nis, in the face of genuine clear and distinct perception, our\naffirmation of it is so firm that it cannot be shaken, even by a\nconcerted effort to call the things thus affirmed into doubt.\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.1, Descartes held that any act of judgment,\nsuch as the affirmation \u201cI think, therefore I am,\u201d\ninvolves both the intellect and will. The intellect perceives or\nrepresents the content of the judgment; the will affirms or denies\nthat content. In the face of genuine clarity and distinctness,\n\u201ca great light in the intellect\u201d is followed by \u201ca\ngreat inclination of the will\u201d (7:59). The inclination of the\nwill is so strong that it amounts to compulsion; we cannot help but so\naffirm. Descartes maintains that unshakable conviction provides the\ncriterion of genuinely clear and distinct perception. Can\u2019t\nsomeone be unshakable in their conviction merely because they are\nstubborn? Assuredly. But Descartes is talking about a conviction that\nremains unshakable in face of serious and well-thought out challenges\n(7:22). To be immune from doubt does not mean simply that you do not\ndoubt a proposition, or even that it resists a momentary attempt to\ndoubt; the real criterion for truth is that the content of a\nproposition is so clearly perceived that the will is drawn to it in\nsuch a way that the will\u2019s affirmation cannot be shaken even by\nthe systematic and sustained doubts of the Meditations.\nPerhaps because the process for achieving knowledge of fundamental\ntruths requires sustained, systematic doubt, Descartes indicates that\nsuch doubt should be undertaken only once in the course of a life\n(7:18; 3:695).\n\nEven so, problems remain. Having extracted clarity and distinctness as\nthe criterion of truth at the beginning of the Third Meditation,\nDescartes immediately calls it into question. He re-introduces an\nelement of the radical doubt from the First Meditation: that a\npowerful God might have created him with \u201ca nature such that I\nwas deceived even in matters which seemed most evident\u201d (7:36).\nDescartes therefore launches an investigation of \u201cwhether there\nis a God, and, if there is, whether he can be a deceiver\u201d\n(7:36).\n\nIn the course of the Third Meditation, Descartes constructs an\nargument for the existence of God that starts from the idea of an\ninfinite being. The argument is intricate. It invokes the metaphysical\nprinciple that \u201cthere must be at least as much reality in the\nefficient and total cause as in the effect of that cause\u201d\n(7:40). This principle is put forward as something that is\n\u201cmanifest by the natural light\u201d (7:40), which itself is\ndescribed as a cognitive power whose results are indubitable (7:38),\nlike clear and distinct perception (7:144). Descartes then applies\nthat principle not to the mere existence of the idea of God as a state\nof mind, but to the content of that idea. Descartes characterizes that\ncontent as infinite, and he then argues that a content that represents\ninfinity requires an infinite being as its cause. He concludes,\ntherefore, that an infinite being, or God, must exist. He then equates\nan infinite being with a perfect being and asks whether a perfect\nbeing could be a deceiver. He concludes: \u201cIt is clear enough\nfrom this that he cannot be a deceiver, since it is manifest by the\nnatural light that all fraud and deception depend on some\ndefect\u201d (7:52). (If you are concerned by the move from infinity\nto perfection, consider that in Descartes\u2019 philosophical\nlandscape perfect meant complete, and infinitude is the highest degree\nof completeness.)\n\nThe second and fourth sets of objections drew attention to a\nproblematic characteristic of this argument. In the words of\nArnauld:\n\nI have one further worry, namely how the author avoids reasoning in a\ncircle when he says that we are sure that what we clearly and\ndistinctly perceive is true only because God exists. But we can be\nsure that God exists only because we clearly and distinctly perceive\nthis. Hence, before we can be sure that God exists, we ought to be\nable to be sure that whatever we perceive clearly and evidently is\ntrue. (7:214).\n\n\nArnauld here raises the well-known problem of the Cartesian circle,\nmuch discussed in recent years.\n\nIn reply to Arnauld, Descartes claims that he avoided this problem by\ndistinguishing between present clear and distinct perceptions and\nthose that are merely remembered (7:246). He is not here challenging\nthe reliability of memory (Frankfurt 1962). Rather, his strategy is to\nsuggest that the hypothesis of a deceiving God can only present itself\nwhen we are not clearly and distinctly perceiving the infinity and\nperfection of God, because when we are doing that we cannot help but\nbelieve that God is no deceiver. It is as if this very evident\nperception is to be balanced against the uncertain opinion that God\nmight be a deceiver (7:144). The evident perception wins out and the\ndoubt is removed.\n\nScholars have debated whether the above response is adequate. Some\nhave constructed other responses on Descartes\u2019 behalf or have\nfound them embedded in his writings. One type of response appeals to a\ndistinction between the natural light and clear and distinct\nperception, and seeks to vindicate the natural light without appeal to\nGod (Jacquette 1996). Another response suggests that, in the end,\nDescartes was not aiming at metaphysical certainty concerning a\nmind-independent world but was merely seeking an internally coherent\nset of beliefs (Frankfurt 1965). A related response suggests that\nDescartes was after mere psychological certainty (Loeb 1992). The\ninterested reader can follow up this question by turning to the\nliterature just cited (as also to Carriero 2008, Doney 1987, Hatfield\n2006, and Newman 2019).\n\nBuilding on his claim that clear and distinct perceptions are true,\nDescartes seeks to establish various results concerning the nature of\nreality, including the existence of a perfect God as well as the\nnatures of mind and matter (discussed more fully in Sec. 3.3). Here we\nmust ask: What is the human mind that it can perceive the nature of\nreality? Descartes has a specific answer to this question: the human\nmind comes supplied with innate ideas that allow it to perceive the\nmain properties of God (infinity and perfection), the essence of\nmatter, and the essence of mind. For readers in Descartes\u2019 day,\nthis claim would naturally raise a further question: assuming that\nthese innate ideas concern \u201ceternal truths\u201d about God,\nmatter, and mind, do these truths hold independently of God, or do\nthey instead derive from the original contents of God\u2019s own\nintellect?\n\nDescartes rejected both alternatives. He denied, along with many of\nhis contemporaries, that there are eternal truths independent of the\nexistence of God. But he departed from many of his contemporaries in\nalso denying that the eternal truths are fixed in God\u2019s\nintellect. Some Neoplatonist philosophers held that the eternal truths\nin the human mind are copies, or ectypes, of the archetypes in the\nmind of God. Some Aristotelian philosophers just prior to Descartes,\nincluding Francisco Su\u00e1rez (1548\u20131617), held that the\neternal truths reflect God\u2019s own understanding of his creative\npower; God\u2019s power includes that, if he creates a rabbit, it\nmust be an animal. Eternal truths are latent in God\u2019s creative\npower, and he understands this, so that if human beings understand the\neternal truths as eternal, they do so by understanding the creative\npower of God, which may be something beyond human capacity (Hatfield\n1993).\n\nDescartes had a different account. He held that the eternal truths are\nthe free creations of God (Corr. 1:145, 149, 151;\nMed. 7:380, 432), originating from him in a way that does not\ndistinguish among his power, will, and intellect. God decides what the\nessence of a circle is, or to make 2 + 3 = 5. He might have created\nother essences, but we can\u2019t conceive what they might have been.\nOur conceptual capacity is limited to the innate ideas that God has\nimplanted in us, and these reflect the actual truths that he created.\nGod creates the eternal truths (concerning logic, mathematics, the\nnature of the good, the essences of mind and matter), and he creates\nthe human mind and provisions it with innate ideas that correspond to\nthose truths. Even in this scheme there must be some eternal truths\nnot created by God: those that pertain to the essence of God himself,\nincluding his existence and perfection (see Wells 1982).\n3.3 The nature of reality\n\nDescartes reveals his ontology implicitly in the six Meditations, more\nformally in the Replies to Objections, and in textbook fashion in the\nPrinciples (esp. I.51\u201365). The main metaphysical\nresults that describe the nature of reality assert the existence of\nthree substances, each characterized by an essence. The first and\nprimary substance is God, whose essence is supreme perfection (Med.\n7:46. 52. 54. 162; Princ. I.54). In fact, God is the only\ngenuine substance, that is, the only being that is capable of existing\non its own. The other two substances, mind and matter, are created by\nGod and can only exist through his ongoing act of preservation or\nconservation, called God\u2019s \u201cconcurrence\u201d\n(Princ. I.51).\n\nDescartes\u2019 arguments to establish the essences of these\nsubstances appeal directly to his clear and distinct perception of\nthose essences. God is an infinite substance and the idea of God\nincludes necessary existence (Med. III, V, Princ.\nI.14, 19). Descartes used this idea of God to fashion an argument for\nthe existence of God, now called the Ontological Argument (see Nolan\n2021).\n\nThe essence of matter is extension in length, breadth, and depth. One\nmight speak here of \u201cspatial extension,\u201d but with this\nproviso: that Descartes denied the existence of space separate from\nmatter. Cartesian matter does not fill a distinct spatial container;\nrather, spatial extension is constituted by extended matter (there is\nno void, or unfilled space). This extended substance possesses the\nfurther \u201cmodes\u201d of size, shape, position, and motion.\nModes are properties that exist only as modifications of the essential\nor principal attributes of a substance. In addition to its essence,\nextension, matter also has the general attributes of existence and\ntemporal duration (these are shared with mind).\n\nThe essence of mind is thought. Minds have the principal attribute of\nthinking, divided into the two chief powers or faculties previously\nmentioned: intellect and will. The intellectual, or perceiving power\nis further divided into the modes of pure intellect, imagination, and\nsense perception. As mentioned in Section 3.3, pure intellect operates\nindependently of the brain or body, while imagination and sense\nperception require the body for their operation. The will is also\ndivided into various modes, including desire, aversion, assertion,\ndenial, and doubt. These always require some intellectual content\n(whether pure, imagined, or sensory) upon which to operate. Perhaps\nfor that reason, Descartes describes the mind as an\n\u201cintellectual substance\u201d (Med. VI, 7:78; also,\n7:12). The mind essentially has a will, but the intellectual (or\nperceptive, or representational) power is more basic, as the\noperations of the will depend on it.\n\nWhat role does consciousness play in Descartes\u2019 theory of mind?\nMany scholars believe that, for Descartes, consciousness is the\ndefining property of mind (e.g., Rozemond 2006). There is some support\nfor this position in the Meditations (Second Replies).\nDescartes defines mind as \u201cthe substance in which thought\nimmediately resides\u201d (7:161), and he says that the term\n\u201cthought\u201d extends to \u201ceverything that is within us\nin such a way that we are immediately conscious of it\u201d (7:160*).\nIf mind is thinking substance and thoughts are essentially conscious,\nperhaps consciousness is the essence of thought?\n\nPerhaps not. Descartes did hold that all thoughts are, in some way,\nconscious (7:226), but this did not mean that we have reflective\nawareness of, or notice, every thought that we have (Corr.\n5:220). In the Second Meditation, he describes himself as a thinking\nthing by enumerating all the modes of thoughts of which he is\nconscious: understanding (or intellection), willing, imagining, and\n(at this point, at least seeming to have) sense perceptions (7:28). He\nthus sets up consciousness as a mark of thought. But is it the\nessence? Not necessarily. If perception (intellection, representation)\nis the essence of thought, then all thoughts might have basic\nconsciousness because the character of the intellectual substance is\nto represent, and any representation present in an intellectual\nsubstance is, thereby, present in mind. An intellectual substance (a\nmind) is a perceiving substance, which intrinsically perceives its own\nstates. Further, he held that any act of will present in an\nintellectual substance is thereby available to consciousness\n(Pass. I.19). (On consciousness and the essence of mind, see\nJorgensen 2020, 2.1).\n\nIn distinguishing between conscious thoughts and thoughts of which we\nare reflectively aware, Descartes allowed for conscious thoughts that\nwe don\u2019t notice or remember. Indeed, his theory of the senses\n(Sec. 5) allows for unnoticed sensations and mental operations.\n3.4 Mind\u2013body relation\n\nIn the Discourse, Descartes presented the following argument\nto establish that mind and body are distinct substances:\n\nNext I examined attentively what I was. I saw that while I could\npretend that I had no body and that there was no world and no place\nfor me to be in, I could not for all that pretend that I did not\nexist. I saw on the contrary that from the mere fact that I thought of\ndoubting the truth of other things, it followed quite evidently and\ncertainly that I existed; whereas if I had merely ceased thinking,\neven if everything else I had ever imagined had been true, I should\nhave had no reason to believe that I existed. From this I knew I was a\nsubstance whose whole essence or nature is simply to think, and which\ndoes not require any place, or depend on any material thing, in order\nto exist. (6:32\u20133)\n\n\nThis argument moves from the fact that he can doubt the existence of\nthe material world, but cannot doubt the existence of himself as a\nthinking thing, to the conclusion that his thoughts belong to a\nnonspatial substance that is distinct from matter.\n\nWhile this argument might secure the existence of a thinker, it does\nnot show that the thinker is not a material thing. That conclusion\nfallaciously rests on conceivability based in ignorance. There is\nnothing to preclude that the thinking thing is in fact a complex\nmaterial system. Descartes has merely relied on the fact that he can\ndoubt the existence of matter to conclude that matter is distinct from\nmind. That argument doesn\u2019t work. From the fact that the Joker\ncannot, at a certain moment, doubt the existence of Batman (because he\nis with him), but he can doubt the existence of Bruce Wayne (who\nmight, for all the Joker knows, have been killed by the Joker\u2019s\nhenchmen), it does not follow that Bruce Wayne is not Batman. In fact,\nhe is Batman. The Joker is merely ignorant of that fact.\n\nIn the Meditations, Descartes altered the argument. In the\nSecond Meditation, he again asserted that he could doubt the existence\nof matter but not the existence of himself as a thinking thing. But he\nexplicitly refrained from concluding that his mind was distinct from\nbody, on the grounds that he remained ignorant of his nature (7:27).\nThen, in the Sixth Meditation, having established, to his\nsatisfaction, the mark of truth, he used it to support a positive\nargument that the essence of mind is thought and that a thinking thing\nis unextended; and that the essence of matter is extension and that\nextended things cannot think (7:78). He based this argument on clear\nand distinct intellectual perceptions of the essences of mind and\nmatter, not on the fact that he could doubt the existence of one or\nthe other.\n\nThis conclusion asserts the well-known substance dualism of Descartes.\nThat dualism has problems. As Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, among\nothers, asked: if mind is unextended and matter is extended, how do\nthey interact? This problem vexed not only Descartes, who admitted to\nElisabeth that he didn\u2019t have a good answer (3:694), but it also\nvexed Descartes\u2019 followers and other metaphysicians. It seems\nthat, somehow, mind and body must be brought into relation, because\nwhen we decide (a mental act) to pick up a pencil, our arm (a physical\nthing) actually moves, and when light hits our eyes, we mentally\nexperience the visible world. But how do mind and body relate? Some of\nDescartes\u2019 followers adopted the position of occasionalism,\naccording to which God mediates the causal relations between mind and\nbody; mind does not affect body and body does not affect mind, but God\ngives the mind appropriate sensations given the state of the body, and\nhe makes the body move by putting it into the correct brain state when\nwe decide (mentally) to pick up the pencil (see Lee 2020). Other\nphilosophers adopted other solutions, including the monism of Spinoza\nand the pre-established harmony of Leibniz.\n\nIn the Meditations and Principles, Descartes did not\nfocus on the metaphysical question of how mind and body interact.\nRather, he discussed the functional role of mind\u2013body union in\nthe economy of life. Our sensations serve us well in avoiding harms\nand pursuing benefits. Pain-sensations induce us toward behaviors that\nusually protect our bodily integrity. Pleasure leads us toward things\nthat are usually good for us. Our sense perceptions are reliable\nenough for distinguishing objects that need distinguishing and for\nnavigating as we move about. As Descartes saw it, \u201cGod or\nnature\u201d set up these relations for our benefit. They are not\nperfect. Sometimes our senses present things differently than they\nare, and sometimes we make judgments about sensory things that extend\nbeyond the appropriate use of the senses.\n3.5 God and sensory error\n\nIn discussing the mark of truth, Descartes maintained that the human\nintellect is generally reliable because God created it. In discussing\nthe functioning of the senses to preserve the body, he explained that\nGod has arranged mind\u2013body interaction so that our sensations\ngenerally are conducive to the good of the body. Nonetheless, errors\noccur. Our judgments about sensory things may be false, just as, more\nbroadly, human beings may make poor moral choices even though God has\ngiven them a will that is intrinsically drawn to the good\n(Corr. 1:366, 5:159, Princ. I.42). For example, we\nmay form the childhood habit of judging, with respect to our color\nsensations, that the color we experience \u201cresembles\u201d\nsomething in objects (the Aristotelian theory). Subsequent\nphilosophical reflection (perhaps instigated by reading Descartes) may\nlead us to conclude that these judgments are unwarranted, because\ncolor sensations are not clear and distinct but obscure and confused\n(Princ. I.66\u201370). In other cases, our sense perceptions\nmay represent things as being a certain way when they are not.\nSometimes we feel pain because a nerve has been damaged somewhere\nalong its length, and yet there is no tissue damage at the place the\npain is felt. Amputees may feel pain as located in their fingers when\nthey have no fingers (Princ. IV.196).\n\nDescartes responded to these errors differently. He explained\ncognitive (judgmental) and moral errors as resulting from human\nfreedom (Med. IV). God provides human beings with a will, and\nwills are intrinsically free. But we have finite intellects. Because\nwe are free, we can choose to judge in cognitive or moral situations\nin which we do not have clear and distinct perceptions of the true or\nthe good. If human beings restricted their acts of will to cases of\nmaximum clear and distinct perception, they would never err. If we go\nwrong, Descartes contends, we are responsible, because we might have\nrestricted our judgments to matters about which we have the certainty\nof clear and distinct perception. The applicability of this solution\nto the case of color sensations and resemblance is, however, not\napparent, as we may not have made a reflective choice when, as\nchildren, we accepted the resemblance account of color experience. In\nthat case, we might become culpable only after reading and accepting\nDescartes\u2019 arguments that color sensations are obscure and\nconfused and applying this finding to our habitual assertion of\nresemblance.\n\nMatters are different for specific errors of sensory representation,\nsuch as the mislocation of pain. The senses depend on media and sense\norgans and on nerves that must run from the exterior of the body into\nthe brain. God sets up the mind\u2013body relation so that our\nsensations are good guides in most circumstances. But the media may be\npoor (the light may not be good), circumstances may be unusual (as\nwhen a partially submerged stick appears bent), or the nerves may be\ndamaged (as with the amputee). In these cases, the reports of the\nsenses are misleading. Since God has set up the system of\nmind\u2013body union, shouldn\u2019t God be held accountable for the\nfact that the senses can misrepresent how things are? Here Descartes\ndoes not appeal to our freedom of judgment, for in fact we must often\nuse the senses in suboptimal cognitive circumstances when navigating\nthrough life, with no opportunity for reflection and reasoned choice.\nRather, he points out that God was working with the finite mechanisms\nof the human body (7:88), and he suggests that God did the best that\ncould be done given the type of parts needed to constitute such a\nmachine (extended parts that might break or be unusually perturbed).\nIt\u2019s not God\u2019s fault that a well-made bodily machine can\noccasionally create sensations that misrepresent.\n\nSome cases of sensory misrepresentation are clear-cut cases of error.\nWith the amputee, the pain seems to be in fingers that are not there.\nThe representational content (that the fingers are damaged) does not\nmatch the world. Similarly, a partially submerged stick may look bent.\nEven if we use our intellects to interpret the illusions or sensory\nmisrepresentations so as to avoid error by withholding judgment or\neven by judging correctly (7:438), it remains clear that sensory\nmisrepresentation has occurred.\n\nIn other cases, Descartes describes the senses as providing material\nfor error, but it remains uncertain whether such error arises from\nmaking unwarranted judgments on obscure and confused sensations or is\ndue to straightforward sensory misrepresentation. In the Third\nMeditation, he describes sensations that were later called\n\u201csecondary qualities\u201d (e.g., colors, sounds, hot and cold)\nas \u201cmaterially false.\u201d Scholars have difficulty\ninterpreting this notion. Descartes initially defines material falsity\nas something that \u201coccurs in ideas, when they represent\nnon-things as things\u201d (7:43). He offers the idea of cold as an\nexample: our senses represent cold as a positive quality of objects,\nbut Descartes considers that cold may instead simply be the absence of\nheat and so isn\u2019t a quality of its own. Accordingly, this case\nshould be assimilated to sensory misrepresentation: representing\nthings as they are not (representing cold as a quality when it is the\nabsence of a quality).\n\nDescartes also offers a different gloss on the obscurity of sensory\nideas. He allows that such ideas may be \u201ctrue\u201d in the\nsense of representing something positive in things, but that they may\ndo so in such a way that \u201cthe reality which they represent is so\nextremely slight that I cannot even distinguish it from a\nnon-thing\u201d (7:44). Accordingly, sensory ideas are not\nmisrepresentations, they are simply so obscure and confused that we\ncannot tell what their representational content might be by\nconsidering their experienced character, such as the phenomenal\ncharacter of cold or of color. We then precipitately make an erroneous\njudgment that color sensations resemble their causes in objects.\n(Metaphysics and natural philosophy are needed to tell us what our\ncolor sensations obscurely represent: properties of object-surfaces\nthat reflect light a certain way\u2014see Sec. 5.) \u201cMaterial\nfalsity\u201d arises from representations so obscure that they allow\nroom for mistaken judgments (e.g., about resemblance).\n\nThe issues surrounding the notion of material falsity in Descartes are\nintricate but telling of his theory of mind and sensory\nrepresentation. Entrance to the literature can be gained through Wee\n(2006), Brown (2006, Ch. 4), and Hatfield (2013).\n4. The New Science\n\nDuring Descartes\u2019 school days, there were signs that the\nscientific conception of the universe was changing. Recall that\nGalileo\u2019s discovery of the four moons of Jupiter was celebrated\nat La Fl\u00e8che in 1610 (see Galileo 1610). More generally,\nCopernicus had, in the previous century, argued forcefully that the\nsun, not the earth, is at (or near) the center of the solar system\n(Copernicus 1543). Early in the seventeenth century, Johannes Kepler\n(1604) announced new results in optics, concerning the formation of\nimages, the theory of lenses, and the fact that the retinal image\nplays a central role in vision. By the early 1630s, Descartes was\naware of William Harvey\u2019s claim that the blood circulates in the\nbody (Corr. 1:263).\n\nDescartes contributed new results to the mathematical description of\nnature, as developer of an accurate model of the rainbow\n(Met. VIII) and as a discoverer of the sine law of\nrefraction. (Descartes was the first to publish the sine law, in\nDiop. II. Previously, the law had been discovered by the\nIslamic investigator Ibn Saul [10th c.], the English astronomer Thomas\nHarriot [ca. 1600], and the Dutch mathematician and astronomer\nWillebrord Snell [ca. 1620]. See Sabra 1967, 99\u2013103, and Rashed\n1990.) As significant as these results are, his primary contribution\nto the \u201cnew science,\u201d or the \u201cnew mechanical\nphilosophy,\u201d lay in his general vision of a mechanistic approach\nto nature, together with many details of that vision for specific\nnatural phenomena (such as magnetism, the formation of the solar\nsystem, and sensory physiology), so as to provide a comprehensive\nalternative to the dominant Aristotelian physics. The process of\nforming a new science continued after Descartes, reaching a high point\nin Newton\u2019s mechanics, including a consolidation of the\nCopernican hypothesis.\n\nIn the textbooks of Aristotelian physics of Descartes\u2019 day, it\nwas common to divide physics into \u201cgeneral\u201d and\n\u201cspecial.\u201d General physics pertained to the basic\nAristotelian principles for analyzing natural substances: form,\nmatter, privation, cause, place, time, motion. Special physics\nconcerned actually existing natural entities, divided into inanimate\nand animate. Inanimate physics further divided into terrestrial and\ncelestial, in accordance with the Aristotelian belief that the earth\nis at the center of the universe and differs in nature from the\nheavens (including the moon, and everything beyond it). Inanimate\nterrestrial physics first covered the four elements (earth, air, fire,\nand water), then the \u201cmixed\u201d bodies composed from them,\nincluding the various mineral kinds. Animate terrestrial physics\nconcerned the various powers that Aristotelians ascribed to ensouled\nbeings, where the soul is considered as a principle of life\n(possessing vital as well as mental or cognitive powers). In the\nsimplest textbooks, the powers of the soul were divided into three\ngroups: vegetative (including nutrition, growth, and reproduction),\nwhich pertained to both plants and animals; sensitive (including\nexternal senses, internal senses such as memory and imagination,\nappetite, and motion), which pertains only to animals, both nonhuman\nand human; and rational powers, pertaining to human beings alone. All\nthe bodies in both inanimate and animate terrestrial physics were\ngoverned by a \u201cform\u201d or active principle, as described in\nSection 1.3.\n\nDescartes\u2019 ambition was to provide replacements for all the main\nparts of Aristotelian physics. In his physics, there is only one\nmatter and it has no active forms. He dissolved the boundary that made\ncelestial and terrestrial differ in kind. His one matter possesses the\nproperties of size, shape, position, and motion; it is infinitely\ndivisible and constitutes space (see Sec. 3.3). This matter is\ngoverned by three laws of motion, including a precursor to\nNewton\u2019s law of inertia (but without the notion of vector\nforces) and a law of impact. Descartes\u2019 matter possessed no\n\u201cforce\u201d or active agency; the laws of motion as decreed by\nGod were sustained by his activity. Earth, air, fire, and water were\nsimply four among many natural kinds, all distinguished simply by the\ncharacteristic sizes, shapes, positions, and motions of their\nparts.\n\nAlthough Descartes nominally subscribed to the biblical story of\ncreation, in his natural philosophy he presented the hypothesis that\nthe universe began as a chaotic soup of particles in motion and that\neverything else was subsequently formed as a result of patterns that\ndeveloped within this moving matter (Princ. III.45; also\nDisc. V, 6:45). Thus, he conceived that many suns formed,\naround which planets coalesced. On these planets, mountains and seas\nformed, as did metals, magnets, and atmospheric phenomena such as\nclouds and rain. The planets themselves are carried around the sun in\ntheir orbits by a fluid medium that rotates like a whirlpool or\nvortex. Objects fall to earth not because of any intrinsic\n\u201cform\u201d that directs them to the center of the universe,\nand also not because of a force of attraction or other\ndownward-tending force. Rather, they are driven down by the whirling\nparticles of the surrounding ether. All cases of apparent action at a\ndistance, including magnetism, must be explained through the contact\nof particle on particle. Magnetism is explained by corkscrew-shaped\nparticles that spew forth from the poles of the earth and flow from\nnorth to south or vice versa, causing magnetized needles to align with\ntheir flow (Princ. IV.133\u201383). To explain magnetic\npolarity, Descartes posited that the particles exiting from the south\npole are threaded in one direction and those from the north are\nthreaded oppositely (like the oppositely threaded spindles on bicycle\npedals). (On Descartes\u2019 physics, looking back from a\npost-Newtonian conception of that discipline, see Slowik 2021.)\n\nDescartes also wanted to provide an account of the formation of plants\nand animals by mechanical causes (Disc. V, 6:44\u201345),\nbut he did not succeed in framing an account that he was willing to\npublish (so that only portions of his physiology were revealed in the\nDiscourse, Dioptrics, Meditations,\nPrinciples, and Passions). In writings that were\npublished only posthumously (in 1664), including the Treatise on\nMan, he developed an extensive physiological description of\nanimal bodies, in which he explained the functions of life in a purely\nmechanical manner, without appeal to a soul or vital principle. (The\nTreatise on Man was circulated in manuscript form during\nDescartes\u2019 lifetime [5:112].) The Description of the Human\nBody (1664) included his speculations on embryogenesis.\n\nIn mechanizing the concept of living thing, Descartes did not deny the\ndistinction between living and nonliving, but he redrew the line\nbetween ensouled and unensouled beings. In his view, among earthly\nbeings, only humans have souls. He thus equated soul with mind: souls\naccount for intellection and volition, including conscious sensory\nexperiences, conscious experience of images, and consciously\nexperienced memories. He regarded nonhuman animals as machines, devoid\nof mind and consciousness, and hence lacking in sentience. (Although\nDescartes\u2019 followers understood him to have denied all feeling\nto animals, some recent scholars question this interpretation; on this\ncontroversy, see Cottingham 1998 and Hatfield 2008.) Consequently,\nDescartes was required to explain all of the powers that Aristotelians\nhad ascribed to the vegetative and sensitive soul by means of purely\nmaterial and mechanistic processes (Man 11:202). These\nmechanistic explanations extended not merely to nutrition, growth, and\nreproduction, but also to the functions of the external and internal\nsenses, including the ability of nonhuman animals to respond via their\nsense organs in a situationally appropriate manner: to approach things\nthat are beneficial to their body (including food) and to avoid danger\n(as the sheep avoids the wolf).\n\nIn the Treatise on Man and Passions, Descartes\ndescribed purely mechanical processes in the sense organs, brain, and\nmuscles, that were to account for the functions of the sensitive soul.\nThese processes involved \u201canimal spirits,\u201d or fine fluid\nmatter as distilled from the blood at the base of the brain and\ndistributed down the nerves to cause muscle motions in accordance with\ncurrent sensory stimulation. The brain structures that mediate\nbehavior may be innate or acquired. Descartes ascribed some things\nthat animals do to instinct; he explained other aspects of their\nbehavior through a kind of mechanistic associative memory. He regarded\nhuman physiology as similar to nonhuman animal physiology, anent both\nvegetative and (some) sensitive functions\u2014those sensitive\nfunctions that do not involve consciousness or intelligence:\n\nNow a very large number of the motions occurring inside us do not\ndepend in any way on the mind. These include heartbeat, digestion,\nnutrition, respiration when we are asleep, and also such waking\nactions as walking, singing, and the like, when these occur without\nthe mind attending to them. When people take a fall, and stick out\ntheir hands so as to protect their head, it is not reason that\ninstructs them to do this; it is simply that the sight of the\nimpending fall reaches the brain and sends the animal spirits into the\nnerves in the manner necessary to produce this movement even without\nany mental volition, just as it would be produced in a machine.\n(Fourth Replies to Objections, Med. 7:229\u201330)\n\n\nMuch human behavior occurs without intervention from the mind.\n\nThe fact that Descartes offered mechanistic explanations for many\nfeatures of nature does not mean that his explanations were\nsuccessful. His followers and detractors debated the success of his\nproposals for nearly a century after his death. His accounts of\nmagnetism and gravity were challenged. Leibniz questioned the\ncoherence of Descartes\u2019 laws of motion and impact. Newton\noffered his own laws of motion and an inverse square law of\ngravitational attraction. His force-based account of orbital planetary\nmotions replaced Descartes\u2019 vortexes. Others struggled to make\nDescartes\u2019 physiology work. There were also deeper challenges.\nSome wondered whether Descartes could explain how his infinitely\ndivisible matter coalesces into solid bodies. Why shouldn\u2019t\ncollections of particles act like puffs of smoke, that separate upon\ncontact with larger particles? Indeed, how do particles themselves\ncohere?\n\nSuch problems were real, and Descartes\u2019 physics was abandoned\nover the course of the eighteenth century. Nonetheless, it provided a\nconception for a comprehensive replacement of Aristotelian physics\nthat persisted in the Newtonian vision of a unified physics of the\ncelestial and terrestrial realms, and that continued in the\nmechanistic vision of life as revived in the nineteenth century. (On\nthe rise of the new science, or what is sometimes called the\n\u201cscientific revolution,\u201d see Henry 2008 and Shapin 1996;\nfor a survey of Descartes\u2019 natural philosophy, see Gaukroger\n2002.)\n5. Theory of Sense Perception\n\nAs the \u201cmechanical philosophy\u201d of Descartes and others\nreplaced the Aristotelian physics, the theory of sensory qualities\nrequired revision. This was especially true for what came to be known\nas the \u201csecondary qualities\u201d (in the terminology of Robert\nBoyle and John Locke). The secondary qualities include colors, sounds,\nodors, tastes, and tactile qualities such as hot and cold. The\nAristotelians maintained that these qualities exist in objects as\n\u201creal qualities\u201d that are like instances or samples of the\nquality as experienced. A red thing possesses the quality red in just\nthe same way it possesses a shape: it simply is red, and we experience\nthat very redness when we see a red object (the \u201cresemblance\nthesis\u201d from Sec. 3.5).\n\nDescartes sought to replace \u201creal qualities\u201d with a\nmechanistic account of qualities in objects. The sensory qualities of\nobjects would be explained by what were later called \u201cprimary\nqualities\u201d (such as size, shape, position, and motion).\nAccordingly, Descartes rendered light as a property of particles and\ntheir motions: it is a \u201ctendency to move\u201d as found in a\ncontinuous medium and radiating out from a luminous body. When light\nstrikes an object, the particles that constitute light alter their\nrotation about their axis. \u201cSpin\u201d is what makes light have\none color rather than another. When particles with one or another\ndegree of spin interact with retinal nerves, those nerves jiggle in a\ncertain way. In the brain, this jiggling affects the animal spirits,\nwhich in turn affect the mind, causing it to experience one or another\ncolor. Color in objects is thus that property of their surface that\ncauses light particles to spin in one way or another, and hence to\ncause one sensation or another (Diop. I, 6:85, 91\u20132).\nSound arises from vibrations in sounding things, and odor from shaped\nparticles that differentially affect the olfactory nerves.\n\nDescartes introduced this new theory of sensory qualities in the first\nsix chapters of Light. He defended it by arguing that his\nexplanation of qualities in bodies in terms of size, shape, and motion\nare clearly understood by comparison with the Aristotelian qualities\n(11:33). Subsequently, in the Meditations and\nPrinciples, he supported this account by appeal to the\nmetaphysical result that bodies possess only geometrical modes of\nextension (Med. V, Princ. I.69, II.4\u20135,\nIV.199). Real qualities are ruled out because they are not themselves\ninstances of size, shape, or motion (even if patches of color have a\nsize and a shape, and can be moved about).\n\nIn addition to a new theory of sensory qualities, Descartes offered\ntheories of the way in which the spatial properties\u2014size, shape,\ndistance, and position\u2014are perceived in vision. In\nDescartes\u2019 day and before, \u201coptics\u201d was defined as\nthe theory of vision, including physical, physiological, and\npsychological aspects. In antiquity, Euclid and Ptolemy wrote on\noptical problems. During the Middle Ages, the Arabic natural\nphilosopher Ibn al-Haytham produced an important new theoretical work\non vision that included an extensive account of the perception of\nspatial properties.\n\nThe theoretical terrain in optics changed with Kepler\u2019s doctrine\nthat vision is mediated by the retinal image and that the retina is\nthe sensitive body in the eye. Previous theorists generally believed\nthat the \u201ccrystalline humor,\u201d now known as the lens, was\nthe sensitive body. Descartes accepted Kepler\u2019s result and\nframed a new theory of spatial perception. Some of his theorizing\nsimply adapted Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s theories to the newly discovered\nretinal image. Ibn al-Haytham held that size is perceived by combining\nthe visual angle that a body subtends with perception of its distance,\nto arrive at a perception of the true size of the object. (Visual\nangle is formed by the directions from a vantage point to a\nseen-object for a given fixation, e.g., the angle formed by the\ndirection to the feet and to the crown of the head of a person\nstanding at moderate distance to us.) In Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s\nscheme, visual angle is registered at the surface of the crystalline\nhumor. Descartes held that size is perceived by combining visual angle\nwith perceived distance, but he now treated visual angle as the extent\nof an object\u2019s projection onto the retina. (On spatial\nperception from Euclid to Descartes, see Hatfield 2020.)\n\nIn Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s account, if the size of an object is known,\ndistance may be perceived through an inference; for a given size, an\nobject\u2019s distance is inversely proportional to its visual angle.\nDescartes recognized this traditional account (Diop. VI,\n6:138\u201340), depending as it does on past experience of an\nobject\u2019s size and on an inference or rapid judgment that\ncombines perceived visual angle with this known or remembered size.\nDescartes held that these judgments are habitual and happen so quickly\nthat they go unnoticed, as do the sensations that present visual\nangle, being rapidly replaced by visual experiences of objects at a\ndistance (Sixth Replies, Med. 7:437\u201338).\n\nIbn al-Haytham further maintained that distance can be perceived by an\nobserver\u2019s being sensitive to the number of equal portions of\nground space that lie between the observer and a distant object.\nDescartes did not adopt this explanation. However, Descartes used his\nmechanistic physiology to frame a new account of how distance might be\nperceived that drew on Kepler\u2019s results.\n\nIn the Keplerian theory of how the eye works, an image is formed on\nthe retina as a result of refraction by the cornea and lens. For\nobjects at different distances, the focal properties of the system\nmust be changed, just as the focal length of a camera is changed\n(Kepler 1611, prop. 64). There were several theories of how this might\noccur, and Descartes sometimes said merely that the shape of the eye\nchanges to accommodate for near and far vision (Diop. VI,\n6:137), sometimes that specifically the shape of the lens changes\n(Man 11:155\u201356, 159). He then theorized that this\nchange in the shape of the lens must be controlled by muscles, which\nthemselves are controlled by nerve processes in the brain.\n\nDescartes realized that the central nervous state that controls\naccommodation would vary directly in proportion to the physical\ndistances of objects. However, unlike the case of inferring distance\nfrom known size and visual angle, Descartes did not suppose that the\nmind is aware of the apparatus for controlling the accommodation of\nthe eye. Rather, he supposed that the central brain state that varies\nwith distance directly causes an idea of distance in the mind, by an\n\u201cinstitution of nature,\u201d which is innate (Diop.\nVI, 6:137*; see also Man 11:183). An institution of nature is\na relationship between characteristics of brain activity and a\nresulting idea or sensation. In this case, the brain state controlling\naccommodation causes the idea (sensation or perception) of distance.\nSuch institutions also link characteristic brain states with color\nsensation (Diop. VI, 6:130; see Mantovani 2022).\n\nWhen we correctly perceive the distance and combine it with visual\nangle (by an unnoticed mental act), the result is a veridical\nperception of a size-at-a-distance. Descartes described the resulting\nperception as possessing the attributes that were labelled \u201csize\nconstancy\u201d in the twentieth century:\n\nConcerning the manner in which we see the size and shape of objects, I\nneed not say anything in particular since it is included in the way we\nsee the distance and position of their parts. That is, we judge their\nsize by the knowledge or opinion that we have of their distance,\ncompared with the size of the images they imprint on the back of the\neye\u2014and not simply by the size of these images. This is\nsufficiently obvious from the fact that the images imprinted by\nobjects very close to us are a hundred times bigger than those\nimprinted by objects ten times farther away, and yet they do not make\nus see the objects a hundred times larger; instead they make the\nobjects look almost the same size, at least if their distance does not\ndeceive us. (Diop. VI, 6:140)\n\n\nWhen Descartes speaks of taking into account the \u201csize of the\nimages\u201d on the retina, he need only be speaking of visual angle,\nwhich is equivalent to retinal-image size. In saying that a nearby\nobject is a hundred times larger on the retina than one ten times\nfarther away, he is speaking of area; the nearby object would be ten\ntimes larger in linear height. If visual angle and object distance are\ncorrectly perceived and combined, the object\u2019s constant true\nsize is perceived. If we get the distance wrong, as in underperceiving\nthe distance to the sun and moon, we misperceive the size, in this\ncase, as too small (Diop. VI, 6:144\u201345).\n\nDescartes\u2019 work on visual perception is but one instance of his\nadopting a naturalistic stance toward conscious mental experience. The\nPassions constitute another (Sec. 6). It is sometimes said\nthat Descartes\u2019 dualism placed the mind outside nature by\nrendering it as an immaterial substance. That is a retrospective\njudgment from a perspective in which immaterial substances are\nautomatically deemed \u201cunnatural.\u201d For Descartes and his\nfollowers, mind\u2013body interaction and its laws were included\nwithin the domain of natural philosophy or physics (in the general\nmeaning of the latter term, as the theory of nature). Descartes spoke\nof regular relations between brain states and the resulting sensory\nexperiences, which his followers, such as Regis, subsequently deemed\n\u201claws\u201d of mind\u2013body relation (see Hatfield 2000). In\nthis way, Descartes and his followers posited the existence of\npsychophysical or psychophysiological laws, long before Gustav Fechner\n(1801\u20131887) formulated a science of psychophysics in the\nnineteenth century.\n6. Passions and Emotions\n\nThe passions and emotions had been a topic of philosophical interest\nsince antiquity and were much discussed in Descartes\u2019 day (James\n1997). His own interest intensified during the 1640s, as a result of\nhis correspondence with Princess Elisabeth (trans. Shapiro, 2007).\nDescartes recognized two separate types of mental states that can be\nclassified as emotions (excitations) of the soul: purely intellectual\nfeelings, such as the intellectual joy of loving God, and\nbody-dependent affects on the mind, called \u201cpassions\u201d (in\nthe etymological sense of the mind being passive in receiving them).\nWe will focus on the latter, which are the subject of Descartes\u2019\nfinal publication, the Passions of the Soul (1649). In the\npreferatory letters to this work, Descartes acknowledged that he\napproaches the passions \u201cas a physicist\u201d or natural\nphilosopher (11:326); but he in fact engaged to some extent all the\nmain genres of writings on the passions: medical, natural\nphilosophical, and moral.\n\nRecall that Descartes attributed only two powers to the mind:\nintellect and will. The intellect is the seat of ideas or perceptions,\nwhich are representations. The will is an active power that responds\nto the represented content, by affirming its truth, denying its truth,\ndoubting it, or desiring it to be the case. The will performs acts\nsuch as choosing to think about mathematics or to raise one\u2019s\narm (Princ. I.32, Pass. I.17\u201319).\n\nIn the Passions (I.22\u201329), Descartes divided the\nperceptions of the intellect that are caused by the body into three\nkinds: perceptions of external objects (such as a candle or a bell);\nperceptions of internal bodily states (such as hunger or thirst); and\nperceptions that we refer to the soul itself, such as bodily love,\nhate, and desire. These passions are \u201cbodily\u201d because it\nis part of their definition that they have a bodily cause (as opposed\nto purely intellectual emotions, which have the soul as cause,\nPass. I.91, 147). This third type of bodily passions can be\ncalled the \u201cpassions proper.\u201d\n\nDescartes defined the passions proper as \u201cperceptions or\nsensations or emotions of the soul that we refer particularly to it\nand that are caused, maintained, and strengthened by some movements of\nthe spirits\u201d (Pass. I.27). Like external sensations,\nthe passions are immediately caused by brain activity (animal\nspirits). But they are referred to the soul, not to an external\nobject, even if they are in many cases triggered by an external\nobject. Suppose that we see a ferocious animal. The sense of vision\ngives us a perception of the shape, size, and color of the animal,\naccording to the ways in which the nerves are affected and cause\nanimal spirits to flow (see Sec. 5). But the flow of animal spirits\nalso causes us to experience the passion of fear. Interestingly,\nDescartes did not hold that we then run from the animal because we\nexperience the fear. Rather, the same flow of spirits that causes us\nto feel fear also, at the same time, by purely mechanical processes\n(see Sec. 4), affects the muscles of the legs so as to make us run.\nThis occurs \u201cwitout any contribution from the soul\u201d\n(Pass. I.38). The function of the experienced passion (the\nfeeling of fear) is to \u201cmove and dispose the soul to want the\nthings for which they prepare the body\u201d (I.40; see also II.52),\nin this case, to make us want to continue running.\n\nThe passions do not respond to all the properties that affect the\nexternal senses. That is, \u201cthe objects which stimulate the\nsenses do not excite different passions in us because of all the\ndifferences in them, but only because of the various ways in which\nthey may harm or benefit us, or in general have importance for\nus\u201d (Pass. II.52). Felt fear responds to the ferocious\nanimal under the aspect of potential harm. Descartes recognized six\nsimple or primitive passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy, and\nsadness (II.69), from which all the other passions are generated.\nWonder arises when we perceive something that is novel. Rare objects\naffect the brain differently than objects we have seen before. The\nresulting brain state causes the body to stay physically focused on\nthe novel object. The experienced passion of wonder then causes us to\nfocus mentally on the same object (II.70\u201378). The inclusion of\nwonder as a primitive type of passion was new (or newly made\nprominent) in the Passions.\n\nThe other five passions present objects as good or bad for us. The\npassion of love makes us want to join ourselves willingly with its\nobject; hatred makes us want to separate ourselves. Desire is a\nfuture-oriented feeling of wanting something it represents as good to\nbe the case. Joy arises from the present possession of a good thing;\nsadness arises when an evil is represented as pertaining to us\n(II.78\u201393). Again, these passions are caused by brain states\nthat arise in the machine of the body. States arise in the brain which\nthen prepare the body for behaviors and cause the felt passion. Here,\nDescartes speaks of brain states as \u201crepresentations\u201d;\njoy, for example, \u201cis a pleasant emotion that the soul has when\nit enjoys a good that impressions in the brain represent to it as its\nown\u201d (II.91). The Passions relies heavily on the\nmechanistic physiology in Descartes\u2019 earlier works.\n\nDescartes\u2019 theory of the passions is complex and covers many\naspects, including the role of the brain, the role of judgment in\ntriggering passions, and the passions in morality. Entrance to the\nliterature can be found in Brown (2006), Rutherford (2021), Shapiro\n(2003), and Hatfield (2007).\n7. Reception and Legacy\n\nThe things that readers find valuable in Descartes\u2019 work have\nchanged across the centuries. His natural philosophy had an immediate\nimpact that lasted into the eighteenth century. His theory of vision\nwas part of that heritage, as were his results in mathematics. His\nmechanistic account of the psychology of the sensitive soul and his\nview that animals are like machines were revived in the nineteenth\ncentury.\n\nDescartes was strongly invoked in some works on the equality of the\nsexes and the education of women. The seventeenth-century French\nCartesian Fran\u00e7ois Poulain de la Barre used substance dualism\nin arguing to the conclusion that \u201cthe mind has no sex\u201d\n(trans. Clarke, 157), although he was not above suggesting that female\nphysiology yields cognitive advantages (Schmitter 2018, 5). The early\neighteenth-century English philosopher Mary Astell used Cartesian\nphilosophy in her advocacy of education for women (Atherton 2001). In\ncontrast, Nicolas Malebranche was less favorable toward attributing\ncognitive equality to women, showing that there was no single position\nshared among the Cartesians concerning equality (Hamerton 2008). (For\nentry into recent work on feminism and Descartes, including historical\nstudies, see Bordo 1999 and Schmitter 2018.)\n\nThe fortune of Descartes\u2019 metaphysics and epistemology is\ncomplex. In his own time, he inspired a raft of followers, who sought\nto develop his metaphysics, epistemology, and natural philosophy, and\nto add a worked-out ethics. These authors included G\u00e9raud de\nCordemoy, Arnold Geulincx, Poulin de la Barre, Antoine Le Grand,\nMalebranche, Regis, and Rohault. The British philosopher Henry More\nhad a long history of engaging with Descartes\u2019 mechanical\nphilosophy and metaphysics, toward which he at first expressed\nqualified admiration, which later turned to deep hostility (More 1662,\n1671; see Leech 2013). Pierre-Daniel Huet (1689) offered a scathing\ncritique of Descartes\u2019 philosophy. Other major philosophers,\nincluding Benedict de Spinoza and G. W. Leibniz, were influenced by\nDescartes\u2019 thought but developed their own, distinct\nsystems.\n\nDescartes\u2019 project to examine the knower as a means to determine\nthe scope and possibilities of human knowledge had a profound effect\non early modern epistemology and metaphysics. Among his immediate\nfollowers, Malebranche most fully developed this aspect of\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy. Subsequent philosophers who were not\nfollowers of Descartes also adopted the strategy of investigating the\nknower. The epistemological works of Locke, George Berkeley, David\nHume, Thomas Reid, and Immanuel Kant pursued this investigation. These\nauthors came to different conclusions than had Descartes concerning\nthe ability of the human mind to know things as they are in\nthemselves. Hume and Kant especially\u2014and each in his own\nway\u2014rejected the very notion of a metaphysics that reveals\nreality as it is in itself. They did not merely deny Descartes\u2019\nparticular metaphysical theories; they rejected his sort of\nmetaphysical project altogether. But they did so through the type of\ninvestigation that Descartes himself had made prominent: the\ninvestigation of the cognitive capacities of the knower.\n\nDuring the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, various\naspects of Descartes\u2019 philosophy were widely invoked and perhaps\njust as widely misinterpreted. The first is Descartes\u2019\nskepticism. In the early twentieth century, one response to the threat\nof skepticism about our knowledge of the external world was to retreat\nto the position that we can only know our own sense data, where\n\u201csense data\u201d are equated with the supposed contents of\nimmediate sensory experience: for vision, color patches having a shape\n(e.g., Russell 1914). Some authors then treated Descartes\u2019\nproject in the Meditations as that of reducing human\nknowledge to immediate sense data, from which knowledge of the\nexternal world was to be constructed. (A version of this reading is\nWilliams 1986.)\n\nAs a reading of Descartes, this position has little to offer. As we\nhave seen, in the Second and Third Meditations Descartes argues from\nthe indubitability of the cogito reasoning to the\ntrustworthiness of intellectual perception to the existence of a\nperfect being (God). This argument does indeed seek to infer the\nreality of a being external to the mind. But the inference does not\ninvoke sensory experience. It proceeds from a non-sensory and innate\nidea of God to the existence of that God. Whatever one may think of\nthe quality of this argument, it has nothing to do with sense data.\nDescartes used skeptical arguments as a tool to temporarily disengage\nthe reader from the sensory world in order to undertake metaphysical\ninvestigations that rely on the pure intellect. But again, sense data\nare not in the mix. The use of skepticism to \u201cwithdraw the mind\nfrom the senses\u201d (Med. pref., 7:9) may be read as an\ninstance of Descartes re-purposing, for his own philosophical ends, a\ntype of writing from his time: the spiritual exercise, now\nreconfigured as cognitive exercises. Accordingly, Descartes\u2019\nmeditator is guided by the text of Meditations in purging our\neveryday reliance on the senses in order to uncover the pure intellect\n(see Sec. 3.1). Recall that the metaphysical doubt is to be used once\nin one\u2019s life in order to find the true metaphysics. The search\nfor absolute certainty supports this project and does not extend to\nordinary life (Med. I, VI, 7:22, 89\u201390). (On Descartes\nand meditative writing, see Underkuffler 2019.)\n\nAnother line of twentieth- and twenty-first century interpretation\nalso focused on the isolation of the subject in the Second Meditation.\nIn the course of that Meditation, Descartes accepts that he knows the\ncontents of his mind, including putative sensory experiences, even\nthough he doubts the existence of his body. Some philosophers have\nconcluded from this that Descartes believed that human beings actually\ncan, in their natural state, have sensory experiences while lacking a\nbody. But Descartes rejected that possibility. In his metaphysics,\nsense perception and imagination depend for their existence on\nmind\u2013body union. Purely intellectual perceptions do not depend\non the brain. But acts of imagination and sense perception require the\nbrain (Pass. I.19\u201320, 43). Descartes did allow that God\nconceivably could produce sense experiences in us independent of the\nbrain; but because God\u2019s perfection is inconsistent with deceit,\nhe would never do this. In any event, in the natural case, human\nsensations require a brain.\n\nA third conception is little more than the use (or abuse) of Descartes\nas a straw-man representative of a kind of over-arching \u201cWestern\nrationality\u201d that over-rationalized the human being and denied\nthe body and emotions. One recent version of this caricature suggests\nthat Descartes affirmed a \u201csense-represent-plan-move\u201d\ncycle in all explanations of human behavior (Wheeler 2005, Chap. 3).\nAs mentioned above, Descartes explained many human behaviors through\nthe machine of the body, without mental involvement. As he said in the\nFourth Replies, \u201cWhen people take a fall, and stick out their\nhands so as to protect their head, it is not reason that instructs\nthem to do this\u201d (7:230); rather, the machine of the body\n(material processes in the sense organs, brain, and muscles) produces\nthis behavior. Descartes envisioned similar purely mechanistic\nexplanations for many of the behaviors that arise with the passions or\nemotions, in which the body acts first and the felt experience of the\npassion serves to get the mind to want to do what the body is already\ndoing (Pass. I.37\u201340). Descartes by no means held that\nall human behavior does or should arise from rational deliberation.\nWhich is not to say that he devalued rational deliberation when there\nis time and need to undertake it. But he was under no illusion that\nall effective human behavior stems from reason.\n\nHow could interpreters get Descartes so wrong? One recent explanation\nsuggests that many post-modern theorists have absorbed their Descartes\nat second hand, and the same explanation might be extended to others\nwho invoke Descartes after only cursory engagement with his writings.\nAs the literary historian Michael Moriarty explains, leading French\ntheorists such as Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault would have, in the\ncourse of their French educations, \u201creceived a solid grounding\nin philosophy, and in Descartes\u2019 works in particular\u201d\n(Moriarty 2003, 52). They then use Descartes as a stalking horse.\nMoriarty suggests that many readers of Lacan and Foucault have not\nreceived the same education in philosophy or in Descartes. Such\nindividuals, \u201cwho read Lacan or Foucault without, or before,\nreading Descartes, thus imbibe a certain perception of Descartes, more\nnegative, perhaps, than the authors themselves, writing against the\ngrain of their own culture, may have intended to convey\u201d (2003,\n53). The implication is that Lacan and Foucault engaged Descartes from\na knowledge of his writings, whereas others who lack such knowledge\nmisunderstand the value of such genuine engagement and take away\nmisunderstood implications.\n\nWhat is Descartes\u2019 legacy now? His influence on the seventeenth\ncentury is historically permanent, including his specific\ncontributions in mathematics and optics, his vision for a mechanistic\nphysiology, and the model he offered to Newton of a unified celestial\nand terrestrial physics that assigns a few basic properties to a\nubiquitous matter the motions of which are governed by a few simple\nlaws. In this regard, Descartes\u2019 work offers an example of\nculturally engaged philosophy. Descartes had a sense for the\nfundamental philosophical issues of his time, many of which concerned\nthe theory of nature and the attempt to found a new natural science.\nHe not only offered a systematic reformulation of the extant natural\nphilosophy, but he did so in a way that could be heard and\nunderstood.\n\nBeyond past historical influences, Descartes\u2019 philosophy\ncontinues to speak to us now and to offer new insights to new\ngenerations of philosophers who are in position to hear what he said.\nThis can be seen in the revival of body-first theories of the\nemotions. (Ironically, some of Descartes\u2019 most vocal detractors\namong scientists who study the emotions, including Damasio 1994,\nespouse theories similar in many respects to Descartes\u2019 own, on\nwhich, see Hatfield 2007.) Further, his theories of sensory qualities\nhave inspired new reflections (Simmons 2003), as has his account of\ndistance perception (see Wolf-Devine 1993 and the entries on optics\nand perception in Nolan 2014). More generally, his\nMeditations is one of the most finely crafted examples of\nphilosophical prose ever written. That in itself ensures its ongoing\nvalue.\n\nIn the end, Descartes\u2019 legacy partly consists of problems he\nraised, or brought into prominence, but did not solve. The\nmind\u2013body problem is a case in point. Descartes himself argued\nfrom his ability clearly and distinctly to conceive mind and body as\ndistinct beings to the conclusion that they really are separate\nsubstances. Most philosophers today accept neither the methodological\nbasis for his claim nor the claim itself. All the same, the\nmind\u2013body problem persists. In distinguishing the domain of the\nmental from that of the physical, Descartes struck a chord. Many\nphilosophers accept the conceptual distinction, but remain uncertain\nof the underlying metaphysics: whether mind is identical with brain;\nor the mental emerges from complex processes in the brain; or\nconstitutes a property that is different from any purely physical\nproperty, even while being instantiated by the brain. In this case, a\nproblem that Descartes made prominent has lived far beyond his\nproposed solution.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature: Works by Descartes", "Other Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature: Works by Descartes": ["</h3>\n<h4 id=\"OrigEdit\">Original editions and early translations</h4>\n<p>\nSee Otegem 2002 for a full bibliography.</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1637, <em>Discours de la methode pour bien conduire sa raison,\n&amp; chercher la verite\u0301 dans les sciences.
