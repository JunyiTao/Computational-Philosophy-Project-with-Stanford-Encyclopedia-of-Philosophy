Sublanguages of L(\u03c91,\u03c9) and the Barwise Compactness Theorem\n\n\nGiven what we now know about infinitary languages, it would seem\n that\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) is\nthe only one to be reasonably well behaved. On the other hand, the\nfailure of the compactness theorem to generalize to\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) in any\nuseful fashion is a severe drawback as far as applications are\nconcerned. Let us attempt to analyze this failure in more detail. \n\n\nRecall from \u00a74 that we may code the formulas of a first-order\nlanguage\n L\n as hereditarily finite\nsets, i.e., as members of H(\u03c9). In that case each finite\nset of (codes of)\n L-sentences\n is\nalso a member of H(\u03c9), and it follows that the\ncompactness theorem for\n L\n can be\nstated in the form:\n(5.1) If \u0394 \u2286 Sent(L) is such that each subset\n\u03940 \u2286 \u0394, \u03940 \u2208\nH(\u03c9) has a model, so does \u0394.\n\n\nNow it is well-known that (5.1) is an immediate consequence of the\ngeneralized completeness theorem for\n L,\n which, stated in a form similar to that of (5.1),\nbecomes the assertion: \n(5.2) If \u0394 \u2286 Sent(L) and \u03c3 \u2208\nSent(L) satisfy\n\u0394\n \u22a8\n \u03c3, then there is a\ndeduction D of \u03c3 from \u0394 such that\nD \u2208\n H(\u03c9).[8]\n\n\nIn \u00a72 we remarked that the compactness theorem for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) fails\nvery strongly; in fact, we constructed a set \u0393 \u2286\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9) such that \n(5.3) Each countable subset of \u0393 has a model but\n\u0393 does not.\n\n\nRecall also that we introduced the notion of deduction in\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9); since\nsuch deductions are of countable length it quickly follows from (5.3)\nthat \n(5.4) There is a\n sentence[9]\u03c3\n \u2208\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9) such that\n \u0393\n \u22a8 \u03c3, but there is no\ndeduction of \u03c3 in\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) from\n\u0393.\n\n\nNow the formulas of\n L(\u03c91, \u03c9) can be coded as members\nof\n H(\u03c91), and it\nis clear that\n H(\u03c91) is closed under the formation of\ncountable subsets and sequences. Accordingly (5.3) and (5.4) may be\nwritten: \n(5.3 bis) Each \u03930 \u2286 \u0393\nsuch that \u03930 \u2208\n H(\u03c91) has a model, but \u0393 does\nnot; \n\n\n\n(5.4 bis) There is a sentence \u03c3 \u2208\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9) such that\n \u0393\n \u22a8 \u03c3, but there is no\ndeduction D \u2208\nH(\u03c91) of \u03c3 from \u0393.\n\n\n\nIt follows that (5.1) and (5.2) fail when\n \u201cL\u201d is replaced by\n \u201cL(\u03c91,\u03c9)\u201d and\n \u201cH(\u03c9)\u201d by\n \u201cH(\u03c91)\u201d. Moreover, it can be shown that\nthe set \u0393 \u2286\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9) in (5.3\nbis) and (5.4 bis) may be taken to be\n\u03a31 on H(\u03c91). Thus the\ncompactness and generalized completeness theorems fail even for\n\u03a31-sets of\n L(\u03c91, \u03c9)-sentences. \n\n\nWe see from (5.4 bis) that the reason why the generalized\ncompleteness theorem fails for \u03a31-sets in\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) is\nthat, roughly speaking, H(\u03c91) is not \u201cclosed\u201d\nunder the formation of deductions from \u03a31-sets of\nsentences in H(\u03c91). So in order to remedy\nthis it would seem natural to replace H(\u03c91)\nby sets A which are, in some sense, closed under the formation\nof such deductions, and then to consider just those formulas whose\ncodes are in A.\n\n\nWe now give a sketch of how this can be done.\n\n\nFirst, we identify the symbols and formulas of\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) with\ntheir codes in H(\u03c91), as in \u00a74. For each\ncountable\n transitive[10]\n set A, let\nLA = Form(L(\u03c91,\u03c9)) \u2229\nA.\n\n\nWe say that\n LA is a sublanguage of\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) if the\nfollowing conditions are satisfied: \n\nL\n \u2286\n LA\nif \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208\n LA, then \u03c6\n \u2227\n \u03c8 \u2208\n LA and \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208\n LA\nif \u03c6 \u2208\n LA and x \u2208 A,\nthen \u2203x\u03c6 \u2208\n LA\nif \u03c6(x) \u2208\n LA and y \u2208 A,\nthen \u03c6(y) \u2208\n LA\nif \u03c6 \u2208\n LA, every subformula of \u03c6 is\n in\n LA\nif \u03a6 \u2286\n LA and \u03a6 \u2208 A,\n then\n \u2227\u03a6 \u2208\n LA.\n\n\n\nThe notion of deduction in\n LA is defined in the customary way;\nif \u0394 is a set of sentences of\n LA and \u03c6 \u2208\n LA, then a\ndeduction of \u03c6 from \u0394 in\n LA is a deduction of \u03c6 from\n\u0394 in\n L(\u03c91,\n\u03c9) every formula of which is in\n LA. We say that \u03c6 is\ndeducible from \u0394 in\n LA if there is a deduction\nD of \u03c6 from \u0394 in\n LA; under these\nconditions we write \u0394\n \u22a2A \u03c6. In general,\nD will not be a member of A; in\norder to ensure that such a deduction can be found in A it\nwill be necessary to impose further conditions on A. \n\n\nLet A be a countable transitive set such that\n LA is a\nsublanguage of\n L(\u03c91, \u03c9) and let \u0394 be a set\nof sentences of\n LA. We say that A (or, by\nabuse of terminology,\n LA) is \u0394-closed if,\nfor any formula \u03c6 of\n LA such that \u0394\n \u22a2A \u03c6, there is a\ndeduction D of \u03c6 from \u0394 such that\nD \u2208 A. It can be shown that the\nonly countable language which is \u0394-closed for arbitrary\n\u0394 is the first-order language\n L,\n i.e., when A = H(\u03c9). However\nJ. Barwise discovered that there are countable sets A \u2286\nH(\u03c91) whose corresponding languages\n LA differ\n from\n L and yet are \u0394-closed\nfor all \u03a31-sets of sentences\n\u0394. Such sets A are called admissible sets;\nroughly speaking, they are extensions of the hereditarily finite sets\nin which recursion theory\u2014and hence proof theory\u2014are still\n possible (for the full definition, see Section 5.1 below).\n\n\nFrom Barwise's result one obtains immediately the\nBarwise Compactness Theorem. Let\nA be a countable admissible set and let \u0394 be a set\nof sentences of\nLA which is\n\u03a31 on A. If each \u0394\u2032\n\u2286 \u0394 such that \u0394\u2032 \u2208 A has a\nmodel, then so does \u0394.\n\n\nThe presence of \u201c\u03a31\u201d here indicates that this theorem\nis a generalization of the compactness theorem for recursively\nenumerable sets of sentences. \n\n\nAnother version of the Barwise compactness theorem, useful for\nconstructing models of set theory, is the following. Let\nZFC be the usual set of axioms for Zermelo-Fraenkel\nset theory, including the axiom of choice. Then we have:\n5.5 Theorem. Let A be a countable\ntransitive set such that A = \u27e8A,\n\u2208 \u2a21 A\u27e9 is a model of ZFC.\nIf \u0394 is a set of sentences of\nLA which is\ndefinable in A by a formula of the language of set\ntheory and if each \u0394\u2032 \u2286 \u0394 such\nthat \u0394\u2032 \u2208 A has a model, so does\n\u0394.\n\n\nTo conclude, we give a simple application of this theorem. Let\nA = \u27e8A, \u2208 \u2a21 A\u27e9 be\na model of ZFC. A model B =\n\u27e8B, E\u27e9 of ZFC is said to be a\nproper end-extension of A if (i)\nA \u2286 B, (ii)\nA \u2260 B, (iii)\na \u2208 A, b \u2208 B, bEa \u21d2\nb\u2208A. Thus a proper end-extension of a model of\nZFC is a proper extension in which no \u201cnew\u201d element\ncomes \u201cbefore\u201d any \u201cold\u201d element. As our application of\n5.5 we prove \n5.6 Theorem. Each countable\ntransitive model of ZFC has a proper\nend-extension. \n\n\nProof. Let A =\n\u27e8A, \u2208 \u2a21 A\u27e9 be a transitive model of\nZFC and let\n L\n be\nthe first-order language of set theory augmented by a name\na for each a \u2208 A, and an\nadditional constant c. Let \u0394 be the set of\n LA-sentences\ncomprising:\n\nall axioms of ZFC;\nc \u2260 a, for each a\n\u2208 A;\n\u2200x(x \u2208 a\n\u2192\n \u2228b\u2208a x =\nb), for each a \u2208 A;\na \u2208 b, for each\na \u2208 b \u2208 A.\n\n\n\nIt is easily shown that \u0394 is a subset of A which is\ndefinable in A by a formula of the language\nof set theory. Also, each subset \u0394\u2032 \u2286 \u0394 such\nthat \u0394\u2032 \u2208 A has a model. For the set\nC of all a \u2208 A for which\na occurs in \u0394\u2032 belongs to A\n\u2014 since \u0394\u2032 does \u2014 and so, if we interpret\nc as any member of the (necessarily nonempty) set\nA \u2212 C, then A is a model of\n\u0394\u2032. Accordingly, (5.5) implies that \u0394 has a model\n\u27e8B, E\u27e9. If we interpret each constant a\nas the element a \u2208 A, then \u27e8B, E\u27e9\nis a proper end-extension of A. The proof is\ncomplete.\n\n\nThe reader will quickly see that the first-order compactness theorem\nwill not yield this result. \n",
