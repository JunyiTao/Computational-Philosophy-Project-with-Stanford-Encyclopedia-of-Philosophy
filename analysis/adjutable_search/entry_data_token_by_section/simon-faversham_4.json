    "main_text": "Logic || Truth and Empty Reference\n3.3 Truth and Empty Reference\n\nSimon also takes part in the medieval discussion of whether truth is a\nproperty of thoughts or things. Simon gives a solution typical of the\nperiod, according to which truth is above all a property of the\nknowing subject who is in possession of a true thought (In\nPerih.: q.6).\n\nSimon accepts the common medieval definition of a true thought as one\nthat is in agreement (adequatio) with things, an agreement\ndetermined by the way things are. However, unlike other\nthirteenth-century masters of arts (e.g., Robert Kilwardby and\nRadulphus Brito), Simon maintains that this agreement concerns the\nsecond, and composite, operation of the intellect\u2014composition\nand division\u2014as well as the first, and simple, one\u2014the\napprehension of quiddities (In Perih.: q.6). Hence, while\nother masters hold that truth can only obtain between composite\nobjects (i.e., composite thoughts and composite things), Simon holds\nthat, since the intellectual apprehension of a quiddity is naturally\nin agreement with this quiddity, it is also susceptible of being true\n(In Perih.: q.6). Regarding the truth of composite items,\nhowever, Simon\u2019s position is remarkably elegant, as is evident\nfrom his discussion of empty reference in his commentary on the\nPrior Analytics.\n\nSimon\u2019s position as regards empty reference is crucially\ndifferent from the one held by modists such as Boethius of Dacia and Radulphus Brito,\nwho claim that the truth-makers of essential predications, as\n\u2018man is an animal\u2019, are real things in the external world,\nso that \u2018man is an animal\u2019 would be false if no man\n existed.[7]\n Simon, however, claims that it is true, supporting his claim with a\ncareful account of truth-determination. According to him, for an\nessential predication such as \u2018man is an animal\u2019 to be\ntrue, it suffices that the quiddities expressed by the subject and the\npredicate are understood and signified. They must be understood\nbecause \u2018man is an animal\u2019 expresses the mental\ncomposition of man and animal, which evidently requires man and animal\nto be understood (Ebbesen 1987: 159). They must also be signified\nbecause otherwise, \u2018man is an animal\u2019 would have no\ncontent at all\u2014it cannot simply express an empty thought.\nHowever, \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018animal\u2019 do not need to\nrefer to or signify real things in the external world.\n\nThe latter claim is shown as follows: assertions of the form \u2018S\nis\n P\u2019[8]\n involve the relevant mode of being of the significate of the\npredicate (henceforth \u2018of the predicate\u2019). In assertions\nwhere real accidents are predicated (e.g., being white, running,\netc.), the relevant mode of being of the predicate is actual\nexistence; therefore, their truth-makers must be real things in the\nexternal world (Ebbesen 1987: 160). Likewise, in assertions where\nlogical intentions are predicated (e.g., belonging to a species or\ngenus), the relevant mode of being of the predicate is mental\nexistence; therefore, their truth-makers are thoughts. But in\nessential predication, the relevant mode of being is neither actual\nnor mental existence, because essences are notionally independent of\nany sort of existence; therefore, the truth-makers are simply the\nquiddities understood and subsequently signified by the subject and\npredicate (Ebbesen 1987: 160). Therefore, \u2018man is an\nanimal\u2019 is true even when no real man exists, simply because\nbeing an animal is a definitional part of being a man. \n",
