    "main_text": "Modeling Agreement || Equilibrium\n3.4 Equilibrium\n\nThere is a long tradition of thinking of the social contract as a kind\nof equilibrium. Within this tradition, however, the tendency is to see\nthe social contract as some kind of equilibrium solution to a\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma type situation (see Gauthier, 1986 and\nBuchanan, 2000 [1975]). Brian Skyrms (1996, 2004) suggests a different\napproach. Suppose that we have a contractual negotiation in which\nthere are two parties, ordering four possible \u201csocial\ncontracts\u201d:\n\nboth Alf and Betty hunt stag\nboth hunt hare;\nAlf hunts stag, Betty hunts hare;\nAlf hunts hare, Betty hunts stag.\n\n\nLet 3 be the best outcome, and let 1 be the worst in each\nperson\u2019s ranking (Alf\u2019s ranking is first in each pair). We\nthus get Figure 1\n\n\n\n\n \nALF \n\n \nHunt Stag\nHunt Hare \n\nBETTY\nHunt Stag\n3,3\n2,1 \n\nHunt Hare\n1,2\n2,2  \n\n\nFigure 1: A Stag Hunt\n\n\nThe Stag Hunt, Skyrms argues, \u201cshould be a focal point for\nsocial contract theory\u201d (2004, 4). The issue in the Stag Hunt is\nnot whether we fight or not, but whether we cooperate and gain, or\neach go our separate ways. There are two Nash equilibria in this game:\nboth hunting stag and both hunting hare. Alf and Betty, should they\nfind themselves at one of these equilibria, will stick to it if each\nconsults only his or her own ranking of options. In a Nash\nequilibrium, no individual has a reason to defect. Of course, the\ncontract in which they both hunt stag is a better contract: it is\nPareto superior to that in which they both hunt hare. The Hare\nequilibrium is, however, risk superior in that it is a safer bet.\nSkyrms argues that the theory of iterated games can show not simply\nthat our parties will arrive at a social contract, but how they can\ncome to arrive at the cooperative, mutually beneficial contract. If we\nhave a chance to play repeated games, Skyrms holds, we can learn from\nHume about the \u201cshadow of the future\u201d: \u201cI learn to\ndo a service to another, without bearing him any real kindness;\nbecause I foresee, that he will return my service, in expectation of\nanother of the same kind, and in order to maintain the same\ncorrespondence of good offices with me and with others\u201d (Skyrms\n2004, 5). Sugden, along different lines, also suggests that repeated\ninteractions, what he calls \u201cexperience\u201d is essential to\nthe determination of which norms of social interaction actually hold\nover time (1986).\n\nThe problem with equilibrium solutions is that, as in the stag hunt\ngame, many games have multiple equilibria. The problem then becomes\nhow to select one unique equilibrium from a set of possible ones. The\nproblem is compounded by the controversies over equilibrium refinement\nconcepts (see Harsanyi and Selten 1988). Many refinements have been\nsuggested but, as in bargaining theory, all are controversial to one\ndegree or another. One of the interesting developments in social\ncontract theory spurred by game theorists such as Skyrms and Binmore\nis the appeal to evolutionary game theory as a way to solve the\ncommensuration and equilibrium selection problem (Vanderschraaf 2005).\nWhat cannot be solved by appeal to reason (because there simply is no\ndeterminate solution) may be solved by repeated interactions among\nrational parties. The work of theorists such as Skyrms and Binmore\nalso blurs the line between justification and explanation. Their\nanalyses shed light both on the justificatory problem\u2014what are\nthe characteristics of a cooperative social order that people freely\nfollow?\u2014while also explaining how such orders may come\nabout.\n\nThe use of evolutionary game theory and evolutionary techniques is a\nburgeoning and exciting area of contract theory. One of the many\nquestions that arise, however, is that of why, and if so under what\ncircumstances, we should endorse the output of evolutionary\nprocedures. Should one equilibrium be preferred to another merely\nbecause it was the output of an evolutionary procedure? Surely we\nwould want reasons independent of history for reflectively endorsing\nsome equilibrium. This problem highlights the concern that social\ncontracts that are the product of evolutionary procedures will not\nmeet the publicity condition in the right kind of way. If the\npublicity condition seems harder to meet, the evolutionary approach\nprovides a powerful and dynamic way to understand stability. Following\nMaynard Smith (1982), we can see stability as being an evolutionarily\nstable strategy equilibrium or an ESS. Basically, this is the idea\nthat an equilibrium in an evolutionary game where successful\nstrategies replicate at higher rates is stable if the equilibrium\ncomposition of the population in terms of strategies is not\nsusceptible to invasion by a mutant strategy. An ESS is an application\nof the Nash equilibrium concept to populations. A population is\nevolutionarily stable when a mutant strategy is not a better response\nto the population than the current mix of strategies in the\npopulation. This gives a formal interpretation of Rawls\u2019s\nconception of \u201cinherent stability\u201d and to Buchanan\u2019s\nnotion that social contracts should be able to withstand subversion by\na sub-population of knaves. This new conception of stability combined\nwith the dynamic nature of evolutionary games provides interesting new\nways for the social contract theorist to model the output of the\ncontract.\n",
