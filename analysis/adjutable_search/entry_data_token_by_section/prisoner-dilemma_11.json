    "main_text": "The Centipede and the Finite IPD\n12. The Centipede and the Finite IPD\n\nMany of the issues raised by the fixed-length IPD can be raised in\neven starker form by a somewhat simpler game. Consider a PD in which\nthey punishment payoff is zero. Now iterate the asynchronous version\nof this game a fixed number times. Imagine that both players are\nrestricted to highly \u201cpunitive\u201d strategies according to\nwhich, they must always defect against a player who has ever defected.\n(One important strategy of this variety is discussed below under the\nlabel GRIM.) The result is a centipede game.\nA particularly nice realization is given by Sobel 2005. A stack of\n\\(n\\) one-dollar bills lies on a table. Players take turns taking\nmoney from the stack, one or two bills per turn. The game ends when\nthe stack runs out or one of the players takes two bills (whichever\ncomes first). Both players keep what they have taken to that point.\nThe extensive form of the game with for \\(n=4\\) is pictured below.\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\nPresumably the true centipede would contain 100 \u201clegs\u201d and\nthe general form discussed here should really be called the\n\u201c\\(n\\)-tipede.\u201d The game appears to be discussed first in\nRosenthal.\n\nAs in the fixed-length PD, a backward induction argument easily\nestablishes that a rational player should take two bills on his first\nmove, giving her a payoff of two or three dollars, depending on\nwhether she moves first or second, and leaving the remainder of the\n\\(n\\) dollars undistributed. In more technical terms, the only nash\nequilibria of the game are those where the first player takes two\ndollars on the first move and the only subgame perfect equilibrium is\nthe one in which both players take two dollars on any turn they should\nget. Again, common sense and experimental evidence suggest that real\nplayers rarely act in this way and this leads to questions about\nexactly what assumptions this kind of argument requires and whether\nthey are realistic. (In addition to the sample mentioned in the\nsection on finitely iterated PDs, see, for example, Aumann 1998,\nSelten 1978, and Rabinowicz.) The centipede also raises some of the\nsame questions about cooperation and socially desirable altruism as\ndoes the PD and it is a favorite tool in empirical investigations of\ngame playing.\n",
