    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\nBiology is concerned with living organisms\u2014with their\nstructure, activities, distribution in space and time, and\nparticipation in evolutionary and developmental histories. Many of\nthese organisms engage in activities that seem best understood in\nterms of information processing or representation. These include\nperception, cognition, signalling, and language use. We will not much\nbe concerned with the role of concepts of information and\nrepresentation in these cognitive contexts. For over the second half\nof the 20th century, biology came to apply informational\nconcepts (and their relatives) far more broadly than this. For many\nbiologists, the most basic processes characteristic of living\norganisms should now be understood in terms of the expression of\ninformation: the response to signals, the execution of programs, and\nthe interpretation of codes. So although contemporary mainstream\nbiology is an overtly materialist field, it has come to employ\nconcepts that seem intentional or semantic. These come with a long\nhistory of causing foundational problems for materialists (and, to\nsome extent, for everyone else).\nThe embrace of informational and other semantic concepts has been\nespecially marked within genetics, and other fields\u2014evolutionary\ntheory and developmental biology\u2014with strong ties to\ngenetics. But informational language is not only found there: for\nexample, hormones are routinely seen as long\ndistance signals that enable one organ system to coordinate with\nothers (Levy 2011). That said, the usage that has generated the most\ndiscussion is found in the description of the relations between genes\nand the various structures and processes to which genes\ncontribute. For many biologists, the causal role of genes should be\nunderstood in terms of their carrying information about their\nvarious products; and perhaps as well about the environments in which\nthese products enhance fitness (Lorenz 1965; Shea 2013). The\nexpression of that information might depend on the presence of various\nenvironmental factors, but the same can be said of other kinds of\nmessage. Breaking things down further, we can recognize two causal\nroles for genes, and hence two potential explanatory roles for genetic\ninformation, within biology. Genes are crucial to both explaining the\ndevelopment of individual organisms, and to explaining the inheritance\nof characteristics across generations. Information has been invoked in\nboth explanatory contexts.\nOne important use of informational language is relatively\nuncontroversial, through being anchored in striking and well\nestablished facts about the role of DNA and RNA in the manufacture of\nprotein molecules in cells, a set of facts summarized in the familiar\nchart representing the \u201cgenetic code\u201d, that maps triplets\nof the DNA bases (C, A, T, G) to individual amino acids, which are the\nbuilding blocks of protein molecules. Not even this use\nof \u201ccoding\u201d language is completely uncontroversial (Sarkar\n1996). More importantly, enthusiasm for the use of informational\nlanguage in biology both predates the discovery of the DNA-RNA-amino\nacid mapping (Schr\u00f6dinger 1944), and goes far beyond it, so this\nmapping is only a partial explanation of the uptake of informational\nnotions in biology. Current applications of informational concepts in\nbiology include:\n\nThe description of whole-organism phenotypic traits (including\ncomplex behavioral traits) as specified or coded by information\ncontained in the genes,\nThe treatment of many causal processes within cells, and perhaps\nof the whole-organism developmental sequence, in terms of the\nexecution of a program stored in the genes,\nTreating the transmission of genes (and sometimes other inherited\nstructures) as a flow of information from the parental generation to\nthe offspring generation.\nThe idea that genes themselves, for the purpose of evolutionary\ntheorizing, should be seen as, in some sense, \u201cmade\u201d of\ninformation. Information becomes a fundamental ingredient in the\nbiological world.\nCharacterising, in a fully general way, the dynamics of idealized\npopulations changing as a result of natural selection.\n\nThere is no consensus about the status of these ideas. Indeed, the\nuse of informational notions is controversial even when giving\naccounts of animal communication, with some theorists denying that\nsuch communication is the flow of information from one animal to\nanother (Krebs and Dawkins 1984; Owren et al. 2010). The result has\nbeen a growing foundational discussion within biology and the\nphilosophy of biology. Some have hailed the employment of\ninformational concepts as a crucial advance (Williams 1992). Others\nhave seen almost every biological application of informational\nconcepts as a serious error, one that distorts our understanding and\ncontributes to lingering genetic determinism (Francis 2003). Most of\nthe possible options between these extreme views have also been\ndefended. Perhaps most commentators within philosophy have seen their\nproject as one of sorting through the various kinds of informational\ndescription that have become current, distinguishing legitimate ones\nfrom illegitimate ones (Godfrey-Smith 2000; Griffiths 2001;\nGodfrey-Smith 2007; Shea 2013; Lean 2014). Philosophers have also\ntried to give a reductive or naturalistic explanation for the\nlegitimate ones.\nThis entry proceeds as follows. In the next section we discuss the\nmost unproblematic technical use of information in biology, which\ndraws on Shannon and the mathematical theory of information. Against\nthat background, some of the more contentious uses are both motivated\nand introduced. In section 3, we discuss\nrecent attempts to build a richer concept out of Shannon\u2019s\ntechnical notion. We then discuss the status of the \u201cgenetic\ncode\u201d in its original sense (section 4),\nand signalling systems inside and outside of genetics\n(section 5). We then look at ways of rejecting\ninformational forms of description (section\n6). The key sceptical idea is the so-called \u201cparity\nthesis\u201d: the idea that while genes play an immensely important\nrole in evolution and development, so do other factors, and so it is a\nmistake to think of genes and only genes as instructing or controlling\nthese processes. The final two sections discuss the idea that\nbiological development in individuals proceeds by the execution of a\nprogram (section 7), and the use of information\nin understanding the role of inheritance systems in the \u201cmajor\ntransitions\u201d in evolution (section 8).\n",
