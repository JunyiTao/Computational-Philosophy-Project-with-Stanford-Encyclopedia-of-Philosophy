More specifically, those Bayesian\nnorms are often thought to be too demanding for at least three\nreasons:\n\n(Sharpness) Probabilism demands that\none\u2019s credence in a proposition be extremely sharp, as sharp as\nan individual real number, precise to potentially infinitely many\ndigits.\n(Perfect Fit) Probabilism demands that\none\u2019s credences fit together nicely; for example, some credences\nare required to sum to exactly 1, no more and no less\u2014a perfect\nfit. The Principle of Conditionalization also demands a perfect fit\namong three things: prior credences, posterior credences, and new\nevidence.\n(Logical Omniscience) Probabilism is often\nthought to demand that one be logically omniscient, having\ncredence 1 in every logical truth and credence 0 in every logical\nfalsehood.\n\n\nThe last point, logical omniscience, might not be immediately clear\nfrom the preceding presentation, but it can be seen from this\nobservation: A logical truth is true in all possibilities, so it has\nto be assigned credence 1 by Sum-to-One and Additivity in\nProbabilism.\n\nSo the worry is that, although Bayesians have a simple normative\nframework, they seem to enjoy the simplicity because they idealize\naway from the complications in humans\u2019 epistemic endeavors and\nturn instead to normative standards that can be met only by highly\nidealized agents. If so, there are pervasive counterexamples to the\ntwo core Bayesian norms: all human beings. Call this the problem\nof idealization. For different ways of presenting this problem,\nsee Harman (1986: ch. 3), Foley (1992: sec. 4.4), Pollock (2006: ch.\n6), and Horgan (2017).\n\nIn reply, Bayesians have developed at least three strategies, which\nmight complement each other. The first strategy is to remove\nidealization gradually, one step at a time, and explain why this is a\ngood way of doing epistemology\u2014just like this has long been\ntaken as a good way of doing science. The second strategy is to\nexplain why it makes sense for we human beings to strive for\nsome ideals, including the ideals that the two core Bayesian norms\npoint to, even though human beings cannot attain those ideals. The\nthird strategy is to explain how the kind of idealization in question\nactually empowers and facilitates the applications of\nBayesian epistemology in science (including especially\nscientists\u2019 use of Bayesian statistics). For more on those\nreplies to the problem of idealization, see\n section 6.\n\n1.10 Concerns, or Encouragements, from Non-Bayesians\n\nIn the eyes of those immersed in the epistemology of all-or-nothing\nopinions such as believing or accepting propositions, Bayesians seem\nto say and care too little about many important and traditional\nissues. Let me give some examples below.\n\nFirst of all, the more traditional epistemologists would like to see\nBayesians engage with varieties of skepticism. For example, there is\nCartesian skepticism, which is the view that we cannot know\nwhether an external world, as we understand it through our\nperceptions, exists. There is also the Pyrrhonian skeptical\nworry that no belief can ever be justified because, once a belief is\nto be justified with a reason, the adduced reason is in need of\njustification as well, which kickstarts an infinite regress of\njustifications that can never be finished. Note that the above\nskeptical views are expressed in terms of knowledge and justification.\nSo, the more traditional epistemologists would also like to hear what\nBayesians have to say about knowledge and\njustification, rather than just norms for credences.\n\nSecond, the more traditional philosophers of science would like to see\nBayesians contribute to some classic debates, such as the one between\nscientific realism and anti-realism. Scientific realism is,\nroughly, the view that we have good reason to believe that our best\nscientific theories are true, literally or approximately. But the\nanti-realists disagree. Some of them, such as the\ninstrumentalists, think that we only have good reason to\nbelieve that our best scientific theories are good tools for certain\npurposes. Bayesians often compare the credences assigned to competing\nscientific theories, but one might like to see a comparison between,\non the one hand, the credence that a certain theory T is true\nand, on the other hand, the credence that T is a good tool for\nsuch and such purposes.\n\nLast but not least, frequentists about statistical inference would\nurge that Bayesians also think about a certain epistemic virtue,\nreliability, rather than focus exclusively on coherence.\nNamely, they would like to see Bayesians take seriously the analysis\nand design of reliable inference methods\u2014reliable in the sense\nof having a low objective, physical chance of making errors.\n\nTo be sure, Bayesian epistemology was not initially designed to\naddress the concerns just expressed. But those concerns need not be\ntaken as objections, but rather as encouragements to Bayesians to\nexplore new territories. In fact, Bayesians have begun such\nexplorations in some of their more recent works, as you will see in\nthe\n closing section, 7.\n\nThe above finishes the introductory tutorial on Bayesian epistemology.\nThe following sections, as well as many other encyclopedia entries\ncited above, elaborate on one or another more specific topic in\nBayesian epistemology. Indeed, the above tutorial only shows you what\ntopics there are and aims to help you jump to the sections below, or\nto the relevant entries, that interest you.\n\n2. A Bit of Mathematical Formalism\n\nTo facilitate subsequent discussions, a bit of mathematical formalism\nis needed. Indeed, the two core Bayesian norms were only stated above\nin a simple, finite setting\n (section 1.2),\n but there can be an infinity of possibilities under consideration.\nFor example, think about this question: What\u2019s the objective,\nphysical chance for a carbon-14 atom to decay in 20 years? Every\npossible chance in the unit interval \\([0, 1]\\) is a possibility to\nwhich a credence can be assigned. So the two core Bayesian norms need\nto be stated in a more general way than above.\n\nLet \\(\\Omega\\) be a set of possibilities that are mutually exclusive\nand jointly exhaustive. There is no restriction on the size of\n\\(\\Omega\\); it can be finite or infinite. Let \\(\\cal A\\) be a set of\npropositions identified with some subsets of \\(\\Omega\\). Assume that\n\\(\\cal A\\) contains \\(\\Omega\\) and the empty set \\(\\varnothing\\), and\nis closed under the standard Boolean operations: conjunction\n(intersection), disjunction (union), and negation (complement). This\nclosure assumption means that, whenever \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are in \\(\\cal\nA\\), so are their intersection \\(A \\cap B\\), union \\(A \\cup B\\), and\ncomplement \\(\\Omega \\mcomplement A\\), which are often written in\nlogical notation as conjunction \\(A \\wedge B\\), disjunction \\(A \\vee\nB\\), and negation \\(\\neg A\\). When \\(\\cal A\\) satisfies the assumption\njust stated, it is called an algebra of\n sets/propositions.[2]\n\nLet \\(\\Cr\\) be an assignment of credences to some propositions. We\nwill often think of \\(\\Cr(A)\\) as denoting one\u2019s credence in\nproposition \\(A\\) and refer to \\(\\Cr\\) as one\u2019s credence\nfunction or credence assignment. Next, we need a\ndefinition from probability theory:\n\n\n\n\nDefinition (Probability Measure). A credence\nfunction \\(\\Cr(\\wcdot)\\) is said to be probabilistic, also\ncalled a probability measure, if it is a real-valued function\ndefined on an algebra \\({\\cal A}\\) of propositions and satisfies the\nthree axioms of probability:\n\n(Non-Negativity) \\(\\Cr(A) \\ge 0\\) for every\n\\(A\\) in \\(\\cal A\\).\n(Normalization) \\(\\Cr(\\Omega) = 1\\).\n(Finite Additivity) \\(\\Cr(A \\cup B) = \\Cr(A) +\n\\Cr(B)\\) for any two incompatible propositions (i.e., disjoint sets)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(\\cal A\\).\n\n\n\n\nNow Probabilism can be stated as follows:\n\n\nProbabilism (Standard Version). One\u2019s\nassignment of credences at each time ought to be a probability\nmeasure.\n\n\n\nWhen it is clear from the context that the credence assignment \\(\\Cr\\)\nis assumed to be probabilistic, it is often written \\(\\Pr\\) or \\(P\\).\nThe process of conditionalization can be defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\nDefinition (Conditionalization). Suppose that\n\\(\\Cr(E) \\neq 0\\). A (new) credence function \\(\\Cr'(\\wcdot)\\) is said\nto be obtained from (old) credence function \\(\\Cr(\\wcdot)\\) by\nconditionalization on \\(E\\) if, for each \\(X \\in {\\cal\nA}\\), \n\\[\\Cr'(X) = \\frac{\\Cr(X\\cap E)}{\\Cr(E)}.\\]\n \n\n\n\nConditionalization changes the credence in \\(X\\) from \\(\\Cr(X)\\) to\n\\(\\Cr'(X)\\), which can be understood as involving two steps:\n\n\\[\\Cr(X) \\ovrightarrow{(i)}\n\\Cr(X \\cap E) \\ovrightarrow{(ii)} \\frac{\\Cr(X\\cap E)}{\\Cr(E)} = \\Cr'(X) .\\]\n\n\nTransition (i) corresponds to the zeroing step in the the informal\npresentation in\n section 1.2\n of conditionalization; transition (ii), the rescaling step. Now the\nsecond norm can be stated as follows:\n\n\nThe Principle of Conditionalization (Standard\nVersion). One\u2019s credences ought to change by and only by\nconditionalization on the new evidence received.\n\n\n\nThe two norms just stated reduce to the informal versions presented in\nthe tutorial\n section 1.2\n when \\(\\Omega\\) contains only finitely many possibilities and \\(\\cal\nA\\) is the set of all subsets of \\(\\Omega\\).\n\nLet \\(\\Cr(X \\mid E)\\) denote one\u2019s credence in \\(X\\) on the\nsupposition of the truth of \\(E\\) (whether or not one will actually\nreceive \\(E\\) as new evidence); it is also called credence in \\(X\\)\ngiven \\(E\\), or credence in \\(X\\) conditional on \\(E\\). So \\(\\Cr(X\n\\mid E)\\) denotes a conditional credence, while \\(\\Cr(X)\\)\ndenotes an unconditional one. The connection between those\ntwo kinds of credences is often expressed by\n\n\nThe Ratio Formula \n\\[\\Cr(X\\mid E) = \\frac{\\Cr(X \\cap E)}{\\Cr(E)} \\quad\\text{ if } \\Cr(E) \\neq 0.\\]\n\n\n\nIt is debatable whether this formula should be construed as a\ndefinition or as a normative constraint. See H\u00e1jek (2003) for\nsome objections to the definitional construal and for further\ndiscussion. \\(\\Cr(X \\mid E)\\) is often taken as shorthand for the\ncredence in \\(X\\) that results from conditionalization on \\(E\\),\nassuming that the Ratio Formula holds.\n\nMany applications of Bayesian epistemology make use Bayes\u2019\ntheorem. It has different versions, of which two are particularly\nsimple:\n\n\n\n\nBayes\u2019 Theorem (Simplest Version). Suppose\nthat \\(\\Cr\\) is probabilistic and assigns nonzero credences to \\(H\\)\nand \\(E\\), and that the Ratio Formula\n holds.[3]\n Then we have: \n\\[\n        \\Cr(H\\mid E) = \\frac{\\Cr(E \\mid H) \\cdot \\Cr(H)}{\\Cr(E)} .\n        \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayes\u2019 Theorem (Finite Version). Suppose\nfurther that hypotheses \\(H_1, \\ldots, H_N\\) are mutually exclusive\nand finite in number, and that each is assigned a nonzero credence and\ntheir disjunction is assigned credence 1 by \\(\\Cr\\). Then we have:\n\n\\[\n        \\Cr(H_i\\mid E) = \\frac{\\Cr(E \\mid H_i) \\cdot \\Cr(H_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\Cr(E \\mid H_j) \\cdot \\Cr(H_j)} .\n   \\]\n \n\n\n\nThis theorem is often useful for calculating credences that result\nfrom conditionalization on evidence \\(E\\), which are represented on\nthe left side of the formula. Indeed, this theorem is very useful and\nimportant in statistical applications of Bayesian epistemology (see\n section 3.5\n below). For more on the significance of this theorem, see the entry\non\n Bayes\u2019 theorem.\n But this theorem is not essential to some other applications of\nBayesian epistemology. Indeed, the case studies in the tutorial\nsection make no reference to Bayes\u2019 theorem. As Earman (1992:\nch. 1) points out in his presentation of Bayes\u2019 (1763) seminal\nessay, Bayesian epistemology is Bayesian not really because\nBayes\u2019 theorem is used in a certain way, but because\nBayes\u2019 essay already contains the core ideas of Bayesian\nepistemology: Probabilism and the Principle of Conditionalization.\n\nHere are some introductory textbooks on Bayesian epistemology (and\nrelated topics) that include presentations of elementary probability\ntheory: Skyrms (1966 [2000]), Hacking (2001), Howson & Urbach\n(2006), Huber (2018), Weisberg (2019\n [Other Internet Resources]),\n and Titelbaum (forthcoming).\n\n\n3. Synchronic Norms (I): Requirements of Coherence\n\nA coherence norm states how one\u2019s opinions ought to fit together\non pain of incoherence. Most Bayesians agree that the correct\ncoherence norms include at least Probabilism, but they disagree over\nwhich version of Probabilism is right. There is also the question of\nwhether there are correct coherence norms that go beyond Probabilism\nand, if so, what they are. Those issues were only sketched in the\ntutorial\n section 1.4.\n They will be detailed in this section.\n\nTo argue that a certain norm is not just correct but ought to be\nfollowed on pain of incoherence, Bayesians traditionally\nproceed by way of a Dutch Book argument (as presented in the tutorial\n section 1.6).\n For the susceptibility to a Dutch Book is traditionally taken by\nBayesians to imply one\u2019s personal incoherence. So, as you will\nsee below, the norms discussed in this section have all been defended\nwith one or another type of Dutch Book argument, although it is\ndebatable whether some types are more plausible than others.\n\n3.1 Versions of Probabilism\n\nProbabilism is often stated as follows:\n\n\nProbabilism (Standard Version). One\u2019s\nassignment of credences ought to be probabilistic in this sense: it is\na probability measure.\n\n\n\nThis norm implies that one should have a credence in a logical truth\n(indeed, a credence of 1) and that, when one has credences in some\npropositions, one should also have credences in their\nconjunctions, disjunctions, and negations. So Probabilism in its\nstandard version asks one to have credences in certain propositions.\nBut that seems to be in tension with the fact that Probabilism is\noften understood as a coherence norm. To see why, note that\ncoherence is a matter of fitting things together nicely. So coherence\nis supposed to put a constraint on the combinations of attitudes that\none may have, without saying that one must have an attitude\ntoward such and such propositions\u2014contrary to the above version\nof Probabilism. If so, the right version of Probabilism must be weak\nenough to allow the absence of some credences, also called\ncredence gaps.\n\nThe above line of thought has led some Bayesians to develop and defend\na weaker version of Probabilism (de Finetti 1970 [1974], Jeffrey 1983,\nZynda 1996):\n\n\nProbabilism (Extensibility Version).\nOne\u2019s assignment of credences ought to be probabilistically\nextensible in this sense: either it is already a probability measure,\nor it can be turned into a probability measure by assigning new\ncredences to some more propositions without changing the existing\ncredences.\n\n\n\nIt is the second disjunct that allows credence gaps. De Finetti (1970\n[1974: sec. 3]) also argues that, when the Dutch Book argument for\nProbabilism is carefully examined, it can be seen to support only the\nextensibility version rather than the standard one. His idea is to\nadopt a liberal conception of betting dispositions: one is permitted\nto lack any betting disposition about a proposition, which in turn\npermits one to lack a credence in that proposition.\n\nThe above two versions of Probabilism are still similar in that they\nboth imply that any credence ought to be sharp\u2014being an\nindividual real number. But some Bayesians maintain that coherence\ndoes not require that much but allows credences to be unsharp\nin a certain sense. An even weaker version of Probabilism has been\ndeveloped accordingly, defended with a Dutch Book argument that works\nwith a more liberal conception of betting dispositions than mentioned\nabove (Smith 1961; Walley 1991: ch. 2 and 3). See\n supplement A\n for some non-technical details. Bayesians actually disagree over\nwhether coherence allows credences to be unsharp. For this debate, see\nthe survey by Mahtani (2019) and the entry on\n imprecise probabilities.\n\n\n3.2 Countable Additivity\n\nProbabilism, as stated in\n section 2,\n implies Finite Additivity, the norm that one\u2019s credence in the\ndisjunction of two incompatible disjuncts ought to be equal to the sum\nof the credences in those two disjuncts. Finite Additivity can be\nnaturally strengthened as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCountable Additivity. It ought to be that, for any\npropositions \\(A_1,\\) \\(A_2,\\)\u2026, \\(A_n,\\)\u2026 that are\nmutually exclusive, if one has credences in those propositions and in\ntheir disjunction \\(\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\), then one\u2019s\ncredence function \\(\\Cr\\) satisfies the following formula:\n\n\\[\\Cr\\left( \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\right) = \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\Cr\\left(A_n\\right).\\]\n \n\n\n\nCountable Additivity has extensive applications, both in statistics\nand in philosophy of science; for a concise summary and relevant\nreferences, see J. Williamson (1999: sec. 3).\n\nAlthough Countable Additivity is a natural strengthening of Finite\nAdditivity, the former is much more controversial. De Finetti (1970\n[1974]) proposes a counterexample:\n\n\nExample (Infinite Lottery). There is a fair\nlottery with a countable infinity of tickets. Since it is fair, there\nis one and only one winning ticket, and all tickets are equally likely\nto win. For an agent taking all those for granted (i.e., with full\ncredence), what should be her credence in the proposition \\(A_n\\) that\nthe n-th ticket will win?\n\n\n\nThe answer seems to be 0. To see why, note that all those propositions\n\\(A_n\\) should be assigned equal credences \\(c\\), by the fairness of\nthe lottery. Then it is not hard to show that, in order to satisfy\nProbabilism, a positive \\(c\\) is too high and a negative \\(c\\) is too\n low.[4]\n So, by Probabilism, the only alternative is \\(c = 0\\). But this\nresult violates Countable Additivity: by the fairness of the lottery,\nthe left side is \n\\[\\Cr\\left(\\bigcup_{n = 1}^{\\infty} A_n\\right) = 1,\\]\n\n\nbut the right side is \n\\[\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\Cr\\left(A_n\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c = 0.\\]\n\n\nDe Finetti thus concludes that this is a counterexample to Countable\nAdditivity. For closely related worries about Countable Additivity,\nsee Kelly (1996: ch. 13) and Seidenfeld (2001). Also see Bartha (2004:\nsec. 3) for discussions and further references.\n\nDespite the above controversy, attempts have been made to argue for\nCountable Additivity, partly because of the interest in saving its\nextensive applications. For example, J. Williamson (1999) defends the\nidea that there is a good Dutch Book argument for Countable Additivity\neven though the Dutch Book involved has to contain a countable\ninfinity of bets and the agent involved has to be able to accept or\nreject that many bets. Easwaran (2013) provides further defense of the\nDutch Book argument for Countable Additivity (and another argument for\nit). The above two authors also argue that the Infinite Lottery Case\nonly appears to be a counterexample to Countable Additivity and can be\nexplained away.\n\nIt is debatable whether we really need to defend Countable Additivity\nin order to save its extensive applications. Bartha (2004) thinks that\nthe answer is negative. He argues that, even if Countable Additivity\nis abandoned due to the Infinite Lottery Case, this poses no serious\nthreat to its extensive applications.\n\n\n3.3 Regularity\n\nA contingent proposition is true in some cases, while a logical\nfalsehood is true in no cases at all. So perhaps the credence in the\nformer should always be greater than the credence in the latter, which\nmust be 0. This line of thought motivates the following norm:\n\n\nRegularity. It ought to be that, if one has a\ncredence in a logically consistent proposition, it is greater than\n0.\n\n\n\nRegularity has been defended with a Dutch Book argument\u2014a\nsomewhat nonstandard one. Kemeny (1955) and Shimony (1955) show that\nany violation of Regularity opens the door to a nonstandard,\nweak Dutch Book, which is a set of bets that guarantees no\ngain but has a possible loss. In contrast, a standard Dutch Book has a\nsure loss. This raises the question whether it is really so bad to be\nvulnerable to a weak Dutch Book.\n\nOne might object to Regularity on the ground that it is in conflict\nwith Conditionalization. To see the conflict, note that\nconditionalization on a contingent proposition \\(E\\) drops the\ncredence in another contingent proposition, \\(\\neg E\\), down to zero.\nBut that violates Regularity. In reply, defenders of Regularity can\nreplace conditionalization by a generalization of it called\nJeffrey Conditionalization, which need not drop any credence\ndown to zero. Jeffrey Conditionalization will be defined and discussed\nin\n section 5.3.\n\nThere is a more serious objection to Regularity. Consider the\nfollowing case:\n\n\nExample (Coin). An agent is interested in the\nbias of a certain coin\u2014the objective, physical chance\nfor that coin to land heads when tossed. This agent\u2019s credences\nare distributed uniformly over the possible biases of the\ncoin. This means that her credence in \u201cthe bias falls within\ninterval \\([a, b]\\)\u201d is equal to the length of the interval,\n\\(b-a\\), provided that the interval is nested within \\([0, 1]\\). Now\nthink about \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d, which says that the bias\nis equal to 0.5, i.e., that the bias falls within the trivial interval\n\\([0.5, 0.5]\\). So \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d is assigned credence\n\\(0.5 - 0.5\\), which equals 0 and violates Regularity.\n\n\n\nBut there seems to be nothing incoherent in this agent\u2019s\ncredences.\n\nOne possible response is to insist on Regularity and hold that the\nagent in the Coin Case is actually incoherent in a subtle way. Namely,\nthat agent\u2019s credence in \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d should\nnot be zero but should be an infinitesimal\u2014smaller than\nany positive real number but still greater than zero (Lewis 1980). On\nthis view, the fault lies not with Regularity but with the standard\nversion of Probabilism, which needs to be relaxed to permit\ninfinitesimal credences. For worries about this appeal to\ninfinitesimals, see H\u00e1jek (2012) and Easwaran (2014). For a\nsurvey of infinitesimal credences/probabilities, see Wenmackers\n(2019).\n\nThe above response to the Coin Case implements a general strategy. The\nidea is that some doxastic states are so nuanced that even real\nnumbers are too coarse-grained to distinguish them, so real-valued\ncredences need to be supplemented with something else for a\nbetter representation of one\u2019s doxastic states. The above\nresponse proposes that the supplement be infinitesimal\ncredences. A second response proposes, instead, that the\nsupplement be comparative probability, with a very different\nresult: abandoning Regularity rather than saving it.\n\nThis second response can be developed as follows. While being assigned\na higher numerical credence implies being taken as more probable,\nbeing assigned the same numerical credence does not really imply being\ntaken as equally probable. That is, (real-valued) numerical credences\nactually do not have enough structure to represent everything there is\nin a qualitative ordering of comparative probability, as H\u00e1jek\n(2003) suggests. So, in the Coin Case, the contingent proposition\n\u201cthe coin is fair\u201d is assigned credence 0, the same\ncredence as a logical falsehood is assigned. But it does not mean that\nthose two propositions, one contingent and one self-contradictory,\nshould be taken as equally probable. Instead, the contingent\nproposition \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d should still be taken as\nmore probable than a logical falsehood. That is, the following norm\nstill holds:\n\n\nComparative Regularity. It ought to be that,\nwhenever one has a judgment of comparative probability between a\ncontingent proposition and a logical falsehood, the former is taken to\nbe more probable than the latter.\n\n\n\nSo, although the second response bites the bullet and abandons\nRegularity (due to the Coin Case), it manages to settle on a variant,\nComparative Regularity. But even Comparative Regularity can be\nchallenged: see T. Williamson (2007) for a putative counterexample.\nAnd see Haverkamp and Schulz (2012) for a reply in support of\nComparative Regularity.\n\nNote that the second response makes use of one\u2019s ordering of\ncomparative probability, which can be too nuanced to be fully captured\nby real-valued credences. As it turns out, such an ordering can still\nbe fully captured by real-valued conditional credences (as\nexplained in\n supplement B),\n provided that it makes sense for a person to have a credence in a\nproposition conditional on a zero-credence proposition. It is\nto this kind of conditional credence that I now turn.\n\n\n3.4 Norms of Conditional Credences\n\nIn Bayesian epistemology, a doxastic state is standardly represented\nby a credence assignment \\(\\Cr\\), with conditional credences\ncharacterized by\n\n\nThe Ratio Formula \n\\[ \\Cr(A\\mid B) = \\frac{\\Cr(A \\cap B)}{\\Cr(B)}\\quad \\text{ if } \\Cr(B) \\neq 0.\\]\n\n\n\nThe Ratio Formula might be taken to define conditional credences (on\nthe left) in terms of unconditional credences (on the right), or be\ntaken as a normative constraint on those two kinds of mental states\nwithout defining one by the other. See H\u00e1jek (2003) for some\nobjections to the definitional construal and for further\ndiscussion.\n\nWhether the Ratio Formula is construed as a definition or a norm, it\napplies only when the conditioning proposition \\(B\\) is assigned a\nnonzero credence: \\(\\Cr(B) \\neq 0\\). But perhaps this qualification is\ntoo restrictive:\n\n\nExample (Coin, Continued). Conditional on\n\u201cthe coin is fair\u201d, the agent has a 0.5 credence in\n\u201cthe coin will land heads the next time it is\ntossed\u201d\u2014and rightly so. But this agent assigns a\nzero credence in the conditioning proposition, \u201cthe\ncoin is fair\u201d, as in the previous Coin Case.\n\n\n\nThis 0.5 conditional credence seems to make perfect sense, but it\neludes the Ratio Formula. Worse, the above case is not rare: the above\nconditional credence is a credence in an event conditional on a\nstatistical hypothesis, and such conditional credences, often called\nlikelihoods, have been extensively employed in statistical\napplications of Bayesian epistemology (as will be explained in\n section 3.5).\n\nThere are three possible ways out. They differ in the importance they\nattribute to the Ratio Formula as a stand-alone norm. So you can\nexpect a reformatory approach which takes it to be unimportant, a\nconservative one which retains its importance, and a middle way\nbetween the two.\n\nOn the reformatory approach, the Ratio Formula is no longer\nimportant and, instead, is derived as a mere consequence of something\nmore fundamental. While the standard Bayesian view takes norms of\nunconditional credences to be fundamental and then uses the Ratio\nFormula as a bridge to conditional credences, the reformatory approach\nreverses the direction, taking norms of conditional credences as\nfundamental. Following Popper (1959) and R\u00e9nyi (1970), this\nidea can be implemented with a version of Probabilism designed\ndirectly for conditional credences:\n\n\n\n\nProbabilism (Conditional Version). It ought to be\nthat one\u2019s assignment of conditional credences \\(\\Cr( \\wcdot\n\\mid \\wcdot)\\) is a Popper-R\u00e9nyi function over an algebra\n\\({\\cal A}\\) of propositions, namely, a function satisfying the\nfollowing axioms:\n\n(Probability) For any logically consistent\nproposition \\(A \\in {\\cal A}\\) held fixed, \\(\\Cr( \\wcdot \\mid A)\\) is\na probability measure on \\({\\cal A}\\) with \\(\\Cr( A \\mid A) =\n1\\).\n\n\n(Multiplication) For any propositions \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in \\({\\cal A}\\) such that \\(B \\cap C\\) is logically\nconsistent, \n\\[\\Cr(A\\cap B \\mid C)  = \\Cr(A \\mid B \\cap C) \\cdot \\Cr(B \\mid C) .\\]\n \n \n\n\n\nThis approach is often called the approach of coherent conditional\nprobability, because it seeks to impose coherence constraints\ndirectly on conditional credences without a detour through\nunconditional credences. Once those constraints are in place, one may\nthen add a constraint\u2014normative or definitional\u2014on\nunconditional credences: \n\\[\\Cr(A) = \\Cr(A \\mid \\top),\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\top\\) is a logical truth. From the above we can derive the\nRatio Formula and the standard version of Probabilism. See\nH\u00e1jek (2003) for a defense of this approach. A Dutch Book\nargument for the conditional version of Probabilism is developed by\nStalnaker (1970).\n\nIn contrast to the reformatory nature of the above approach, the\nsecond one is conservative. On this approach, the Ratio\nFormula is sufficient by itself as a norm (or definition) for\nconditional credences. It makes sense to have a credence conditional\non \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d because one\u2019s credence in that\nconditioning proposition ought to be an infinitesimal rather than\nzero. This approach may be called the approach of\ninfinitesimals. It forms a natural package with the\ninfinitesimal approach to saving Regularity from the Coin Case, which\nwas discussed in\n section 3.3.\n\nBetween the conservative and the reformatory, there is the\nmiddle way, due to Kolmogorov (1933). The idea is to think\nabout the cases where the Ratio Formula applies, and then use them to\n\u201capproximate\u201d the cases where it does not apply. If this\ncan be done, then although the Ratio Formula is not all there is to\nnorms for conditional credences, it comes close. To be more precise,\nwhen we try to conditionalize on a zero-credence proposition \\(B\\), we\ncan approximate \\(B\\) by a sequence of propositions \\(B_1,\\)\n\\(B_2,\\)\u2026 such that:\n\nthose propositions \\(B_1, B_2, \\ldots\\) are progressively more\nspecific (i.e., \\(B_i \\supset B_{i+1}\\)),\nthey jointly say what \\(B\\) says (i.e., \\(\\bigcap_{i=1}^{\\infty}\nB_i = B\\)).\n\n\nIn that case, it seems tempting to accept the norm or definition that\nconditionalization on \\(B\\) be approximated by successive\nconditionalizations on \\(B_1, B_2, \\ldots\\), or in symbols:\n\n\\[\\Cr(A \\mid B) = \\lim_{i \\to \\infty}\\Cr(A \\mid B_i),\\]\n\n\nwhere each term \\(\\Cr(A \\mid B_i)\\) is governed by the Ratio Formula\nbecause \\(\\Cr(B_i)\\) is nonzero by design. An important consequence of\nthis approach is that, when one chooses a different sequence of\npropositions to approximate \\(B\\), the limit of conditionalizations\nmight be different, and, hence, a credence conditional on \\(B\\) is, or\nought to be, relativized to how one presents \\(B\\) as the limit of a\nsequence of approximating propositions. This relativization is often\nillustrated with what\u2019s called the Borel-Kolmogorov\nparadox; see Rescorla (2015) for an accessible presentation and\ndiscussion. Once the mathematical details are refined, this approach\nbecomes what\u2019s known as the theory of regular conditional\n probability.[5]\n A Dutch Book argument for this way of assigning conditional credences\nis developed by Rescorla (2018).\n\nFor a critical comparison of those three approaches to conditional\ncredences, see the survey by Easwaran (2019).\n\n\n3.5 Chance-Credence Principles\n\nRecall the Coin Case discussed above: one\u2019s credence in\n\u201cthe coin will land heads the next time it is tossed\u201d\nconditional on \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d is equal to 0.5. This\n0.5 conditional credence seems to be the only permissible alternative\nuntil the result of the next coin toss is observed. This example\nsuggests a general norm, which connects chances to conditional\ncredences:\n\n\n\n\nThe Principal Principle/Direct Inference\nPrinciple. Let \\(\\Cr\\) be one\u2019s prior, i.e., the credence\nassignment that one has at the beginning of an inquiry. Let \\(E\\) be\nthe event that such and such things will happen at a certain future\ntime. Let \\(A\\) be a proposition that entails \\(\\Ch(E) = c\\), which\nsays that the chance for \\(E\\) to come out true is equal to \\(c\\).\nThen one\u2019s prior \\(\\Cr\\) ought to be such that \\(\\Cr(E \\mid A) =\nc\\), if \\(A\\) is an \u201cordinary\u201d proposition in that it is\nlogically equivalent to the conjunction of \\(\\Ch(E) = c\\) with an\n\u201cadmissible\u201d proposition.\n\n\n\nThe if-clause refers to \u201cadmissible\u201d propositions, which\nare roughly propositions that give no more information about whether\nor not \\(E\\) is true than is already contained in \\(\\Ch(E) = c\\). To\nsee why we need the qualification imposed by the if-clause, suppose\nfor instance that the event \\(E\\) is \u201cthe coin will land heads\nthe next time it is tossed\u201d. If the conditioning proposition\n\\(A\\) is \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d, it is a paradigmatic example\nof an \u201cordinary\u201d proposition. This reproduces the Coin\nCase, with the conditional credence being the chance 0.5.\nAlternatively, if the conditioning proposition \\(A\\) is the\nconjunction of \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d and \\(E\\), then the\nconditional credence \\(\\Cr(E \\mid A)\\) should be 1 rather than the 0.5\nchance of \\(E\\) that \\(A\\) entails. After all, to be given this \\(A\\)\nis to be given a lot of information, which entails \\(E\\). So this case\nis supposed to be ruled out by an account of \u201cadmissible\u201d\npropositions. Lewis (1980) initiates a systematic quest for such an\naccount, which has invited counterexamples and responses. See Joyce\n(2011: sec. 4.2) for a survey.\n\nThe Principal Principle has been defended with an argument based on\nconsiderations about the accuracies of credences (Pettigrew 2012), and\nwith a nonstandard Dutch Book argument (Pettigrew 2020a: sec.\n2.8).\n\nThe Principal Principle is important perhaps mainly because of its\nextensive applications in Bayesian statistics, in which this principle\nis more often called the Direct Inference Principle. To illustrate,\nsuppose that you are somehow certain that one of the following two\nhypotheses is true: \\(H_1 =\\) \u201cthe coin has a bias 0.4\u201d\nand \\(H_2 =\\) \u201cthe coin has a bias 0.6\u201d, which are\nparadigmatic examples of \u201cordinary\u201d hypotheses. Then your\ncredence in the first hypothesis \\(H_1\\) given evidence \\(E\\) that the\ncoin lands heads ought to be expressible as\n follows:[6]\n \n\\[\\begin{align}\n        \\Cr(H_1 \\mid E)\n        &= \\frac{ \\Cr(E \\mid H_1) \\cdot \\Cr(H_1) }{ \\sum_{i =1}^2 \\Cr(E \\mid H_i) \\cdot \\Cr(H_i) } &{\\text{by Bayes' Theorem}\\\\ \\text{(as stated in \u00a72)}}\n        \\\\\n        &= \\frac{ 0.4 \\cdot \\Cr(H_1) }{ 0.4 \\cdot \\Cr(H_1) + 0.6 \\cdot \\Cr(H_2) } &{\\text{by the Principal}\\\\ \\text{Principle}}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSo Bayes\u2019 Theorem works by expressing posterior credences in\nterms of some prior credences \\(\\Cr(H_i)\\) and some prior conditional\ncredences \\(\\Cr(E \\mid H_i)\\). The latter, called\nlikelihoods, are subjective opinions, but they can\nbe replaced by objective chances thanks to the Principal\nPrinciple. So this principle is often taken to be an important way to\nreduce some subjective factors in the Bayesian account of scientific\ninference. For discussions of other subjective factors, see\n section 4.1.\n\nEven though the Principal Principle has important, extensive\napplications in Bayesian statistics as just explained, de Finetti\n(1970 [1974]) argues that it is actually dispensable and thus need not\nbe accepted as a norm. To be more specific, he argues that the\nPrincipal Principle is dispensable in a way that changes little of the\nactual practice of Bayesian statistics. His argument relies on his\nexchangeability theorem. See Gillies (2000: 69\u201382) for\na non-technical introduction to this topic; also see Joyce (2011: sec.\n4.1) for a more advanced survey.\n\n3.6 Reflection and Other Deference Principles\n\nWe have just discussed the Principal Principle, which in a sense asks\none to defer to a kind of expert (Gaifman 1986): the chance of an\nevent \\(E\\) can be understood as an expert at predicting whether \\(E\\)\nwill come out true. So, conditional on that expert\u2019s saying so\nand so about \\(E\\), one\u2019s opinion ought to defer to that expert.\nConstrued that way, the Principal Principle is a kind of deference\nprinciple. There can be different deference principles, referring\nto different kinds of experts.\n\nHere is another example of a deference principle, proposed by van\nFraassen (1984):\n\n\n\n\nThe Reflection Principle. One\u2019s credence at\nany time \\(t_1\\) in a proposition \\(A\\), conditional on the\nproposition that one\u2019s future credence at \\(t_2\\) \\((> t_1)\\)\nin \\(A\\) will be equal to \\(x\\), ought to be equal to \\(x\\); or put\nsymbolically: \n\\[\\Cr_{t_1}( A \\mid \\Cr_{t_2}(A) = x )  = x.\\]\n\n\nMore generally, it ought to be that \n\\[\\Cr_{t_1}( A \\mid \\Cr_{t_2}(A) \\in [x, x'] )  \\in  [x, x'].\\]\n \n\n\n\nHere, one\u2019s future self is taken as an expert to which one ought\nto defer. The Reflection Principle admits of a Dutch Book argument\n(van Fraassen 1984). There is another way to defend the Reflection\nPrinciple: this synchronic norm is argued to follow from the\nsynchronic norm that one ought, at any time, to be fully\ncertain that one will follow the diachronic Principle of\nConditionalization (as suggested by Weisberg\u2019s 2007 modification\nof van Fraassen\u2019s 1995 argument).\n\nThe Reflection Principle has invited some putative counterexamples.\nHere is one, adapted from Talbott (1991):\n\n\nExample (Dinner). Today is March 15, 1989.\nSomeone is very confident that she is now having spaghetti for dinner.\nShe is also very confident that, on March 15, 1990 (exactly one year\nfrom today), she will have completely forgotten what she is having for\ndinner now.\n\n\n\nSo, this person\u2019s current assignment of credences\n\\(\\Cr_\\textrm{1989}\\) has the following properties, where \\(A\\) is the\nproposition that she has spaghetti for dinner on March 15, 1989:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    \\Cr_\\textrm{1989} \\big( A \\big) &= \\text{high} \n    \\\\\n    \\Cr_\\textrm{1989} \\Big( \\Cr_\\textrm{1989+1}(A) \\mbox{ is low}  \\Big) &= \\text{high} .\n    \\end{align}\\]\n\n\nBut conditionalization on a proposition with a high credence can only\nslightly change the credence assignment. For such a conditionalization\ninvolves lowering just a small bit of credence down to zero and hence\nit only requires a slight rescaling, by a factor close to 1. So,\nassuming that \\(\\Cr\\) is a probability measure, we have:\n\n\\[\n    \\Cr_\\textrm{1989} \\Big( A \\Bigm\\vert \\Cr_\\textrm{1989+1}(A) \\mbox{ is low}  \\Big) = \\text{still high} ,\n\\]\n\n\nwhich violates the Reflection Principle.\n\nThe Dinner Case serves as a putative counterexample to the Reflection\nPrinciple by allowing one to suspect that one will lose some memories.\nSo it allows one to have a specific kind of epistemic\nself-doubt\u2014to doubt one\u2019s own ability to achieve or\nretain an epistemically favorable state. In fact, some are worried\nthat the Reflection Principle is generally incompatible with epistemic\nself-doubt, which seems rational and permissible. For more on this\nworry, see the entry on\n epistemic self-doubt.\n\n\n4. Synchronic Norms (II): The Problem of the Priors\n\nMuch of what Bayesians have to say about confirmation and inductive\ninference depends crucially on the norms that govern one\u2019s prior\ncredences (the credences that one has at the beginning of an inquiry).\nBut what are those norms? This is known as the problem of the\npriors. Some potential solutions were only sketched in the\ntutorial\n section 1.5.\n They will be detailed in this section.\n\n4.1 Subjective Bayesianism\n\nSubjective Bayesianism is the view that every prior is permitted\nunless it fails to be coherent (de Finetti 1970 [1974]; Savage 1972;\nJeffrey 1965; van Fraassen 1989: ch. 7). Holding that view as the\ncommon ground, subjective Bayesians often disagree over what coherence\nrequires (which was the topic of the preceding\n section 3).\n\nThe most common worry for subjective Bayesianism is that, on that\nview, anything goes. For example, under just Probabilism and\nRegularity, there is a prior that follows enumerative induction and\nthere also is a prior whose posterior never generalizes from data,\ndefying enumerative induction (see Carnap 1955 for details, but see\nFitelson 2006 for a concise presentation). Under just Probabilism and\nthe Principal Principle, there is a prior that follows Ockham\u2019s\nrazor in statistical model selection but there also is a prior that\ndoes not (Forster 1995: sec. 3; Sober 2002: sec.\n 6).[7]\n So, although subjective Bayesianism does not really say that anything\ngoes, it seems to permit too much, failing to account for some\nimportant aspects of scientific objectivity\u2014or so the worry\ngoes. Subjective Bayesians have replied with at least two\nstrategies.\n\nHere is one: argue that, despite appearances, coherence alone captures\neverything there is to scientific objectivity. For example, it might\nbe argued that it is actually correct to permit a wide range of\npriors, for people come with different background opinions and it\nseems wrong\u2014objectively wrong\u2014to require all of them to\nchange to the same opinion at once. What ought to be the case is,\nrather, that people\u2019s opinions be brought closer and closer to\neach other as their shared evidence accumulates. This idea of\nmerging-of-opinions as a kind of scientific objectivity can\nbe traced back to Peirce (1877), although he develops this idea for\nthe epistemology of all-or-nothing beliefs rather than credences. Some\nsubjective Bayesians propose to develop this Peircean idea in the\nframework of subjective Bayesianism: to have the ideal of\nmerging-of-opinions be derived as a norm\u2014derived solely from\ncoherence norms. That is, they prove so-called merging-of-opinions\ntheorems (Blackwell & Dubins 1962; Gaifman & Snir 1982).\nSuch a theorem states that, under such and such contingent initial\nconditions together with such and such coherence norms, two agents\nmust be certain that their credences in the hypotheses under\nconsideration will merge with each other in the long run as\nthe shared evidence accumulates indefinitely.\n\nThe above theorem is stated with two italicized parts, which are the\ntargets of some worries. The merging of the two agents\u2019 opinions\nmight not happen and is only believed with certainty to happen in the\nlong run. And the long run might be too long. There is another worry:\nthe proof of such a theorem requires Countable Additivity as a norm of\ncredences, which is controversial, as was discussed in\n section 3.2.\n See Earman (1992: ch. 6) for more on those\n worries.[8]\n For a recent development of merging-of-opinions theorems and a\ndefense of their use, see Huttegger (2015).\n\nWhether or not merging-of-opinions theorems can capture the intended\nkind of scientific objectivity, it is still debated whether there are\nother kinds of scientific objectivity that elude subjective\nBayesianism. For more on this issue, see\n section 4.2 of the entry on scientific objectivity,\n Gelman & Hennig (2017) (including peer discussions), Sprenger\n(2018), and Sprenger & Hartmann (2019: ch. 11).\n\nHere is a second strategy in defense of scientific objectivity for\nsubjective Bayesians: distance themselves from any substantive theory\nof inductive inference and hold instead that Bayesian epistemology can\nbe construed as a kind of deductive logic. This view draws on some\nparallel features between deductive logic and Bayesian epistemology.\nFirst, the coherence of credences can be construed as an analogue of\nthe logical consistency of propositions or all-or-nothing beliefs\n(Jeffrey 1983). Second, just as premises are inputs into a deductive\nreasoning process, prior credences are inputs into the process of an\ninquiry. And, just as the job of deductive logic is not to say what\npremises we should have except that they be logically consistent,\nBayesian epistemology need not say what prior credences we should have\nexcept that they be coherent (Howson 2000: 135\u2013145). Call this\nview the deductive construal of Bayesian epistemology, for\nlack of a standard name.\n\nYet it might be questioned whether the above parallelism really works\nin favor of subjective Bayesianism. Just as substantive theories of\ninductive inferences have been developed with deductive logic as their\nbasis, to take the parallelism seriously it seems that there should\nalso be a substantive account of inductive inferences with the\ndeductive construal of Bayesian epistemology as their basis. Indeed,\nthe anti-subjectivists to be discussed below\u2014objective Bayesians\nand forward-looking Bayesians\u2014all think that a substantive\naccount of inductive inferences is furnished by norms that go beyond\nthe consideration of coherence. It is to such a view that I turn now.\nBut for more on subjective Bayesianism, see the survey by Joyce\n(2011).\n\n4.2 Objective Bayesianism\n\nObjective Bayesians contend that, in addition to coherence,\nthere is another epistemic virtue or ideal that needs to be codified\ninto a norm for prior credences: freedom from bias and avoidance of\noverly strong opinions (Jeffreys 1939; Carnap 1945; Jaynes 1957, 1968;\nRosenkrantz 1981; J. Williamson 2010). This view is often motivated by\na case like this:\n\n\nExample (Six-Faced Die). Suppose that there is\na cubic die with six faces that look symmetric, and we are going to\ntoss it. Suppose further that we have no other idea about this die.\nNow, what should our credence be that the die will come up 6?\n\n\n\nAn intuitive answer is \\(1/6\\), for it seems that we ought to\ndistribute our credences evenly, with an equal credence, \\(1/6\\), in\neach of the six possible outcomes. While subjective Bayesians would\nonly say that we may do so, objective Bayesians would make\nthe stronger claim that we ought to do so. More generally,\nobjective Bayesians are sympathetic to this norm:\n\n\nThe Principle of Indifference. A\nperson\u2019s credences in any two propositions should be equal if\nher total evidence no more supports one than the other (the\nevidential symmetry version), or if she has no sufficient\nreason to have a higher credence in one than in the other (the\ninsufficient reason version).\n\n\n\nA standard worry about the Indifference Principle comes from\nBertrand\u2019s paradox. Here is a simplified version\n(adapted from van Fraassen 1989):\n\n\nExample (Square). Suppose that there is a\nsquare and that we know for sure that its side length is between 1 and\n4 centimeters. Suppose further that we have no other idea about that\nsquare. Now, how confident should we be that the square has a side\nlength between 1 and 2 centimeters?\n\n\n\nNow, have a look at the two groups of propositions listed in the table\nbelow. The left group (1)\u2013(3) focuses on possible side lengths\nand divides up possibilities by 1-cm-long intervals; the right group\n\\((1')\\)\u2013\\((15')\\) focuses on possible areas instead:\n\n\n\n\nPartition By\nLength\nPartition By\nArea  \n\n\n(1) The side length is 1 to 2 cm.\n\\((1')\\) The area is 1 to 2\ncm2. \n\n(2) The side length is 2 to 3 cm.\n\\((2')\\) The area is 2 to 3\ncm2. \n\n(3) The side length is 3 to 4 cm.\n\\((3')\\) The area is 3 to 4\ncm2. \n\n\n\\(\\;\\;\\vdots\\) \n\n\n\\((15')\\) The area is 15 to 16\ncm2  \n\n\n\nThe Indifference Principle seems ask us to assign a \\(1/3\\) credence\nto each proposition in the left group \\((1)\\)\u2013\\((3)\\) and,\nsimultaneously, assign \\(1/15\\) to each one in the right group\n\\((1')\\)\u2013\\((15')\\). If so, it asks us to assign unequal\ncredences to equivalent propositions: \\(1/3\\) to \\((1)\\), and \\(3/15\\)\nto the disjunction \\((1') \\!\\vee (2') \\!\\vee (3')\\). That violates\nProbabilism.\n\nIn reply, objective Bayesians may reply that Bertrand\u2019s paradox\nprovides no conclusive reason against the Indifference Principle and\nperhaps the fault lies elsewhere. Following White (2010), let\u2019s\nthink about how the Indifference Principle works: it outputs a\nnormative recommendation for credence assignment only when it receives\none or another input, which is a judgement about insufficient\nreason or evidential symmetry. Indeed, Bertrand\u2019s paradox has to\nbe generated by at least two inputs, such as, first, the\nlack-of-evidence judgement about the left group in the above table\nand, second, that about the right group. So perhaps the fault lies not\nwith the Indifference Principle but with one of the two\ninputs\u2014after all, garbage in, garbage out. White (2010)\nsubstantiates the above idea with an argument to this effect: at least\none of the two inputs in Bertrand\u2019s paradox must be mistaken,\nbecause they already contradict each other even when we only assume\ncertain weak, plausible principles that have nothing to do with\ncredences and concern just the evidential support relation.\n\nThere still remains the task of developing a systematic account to\nguide one\u2019s judgments of evidential symmetry (or insufficient\nreason) before those judgments are passed as inputs to the\nIndifference Principle. An important source of inspiration has been\nthe symmetry in the Six-Faced Die Case: it is a kind of\nphysical symmetry due to the cubic shape of the die; it is\nalso a kind of permutation symmetry because nothing essential\nchanges when the six faces of the die are relabeled. Those two aspects\nof the symmetry\u2014physical and permutational\u2014are extended by\ntwo influential approaches to the Indifference Principle,\nrespectively, which are presented in turn below.\n\nThe first approach to the Indifference Principle looks for a wider\nrange of physical symmetries, including especially the\nsymmetries associated with a change of coordinate or unit. This\napproach, developed by Jeffreys (1946) and Jaynes (1968, 1973), yields\na consistent, somewhat surprising answer 1/2 (rather than 1/3 or 1/15)\nto the question in the Square Case. See\n supplement C\n for some non-technical details.\n\nThe second approach to the Indifference Principle focuses on\npermutation symmetries and proposes to look for those not in\na physical system but in the language in use. This approach\nis due to Carnap (1945, 1955). He maintains, for example, that two\nsentences ought to be assigned equal prior credences if one differs\nfrom the other only by a permutation of the names in use. Although\nCarnap says little about the Square Case, he has much to say about how\nhis approach to the Indifference Principle helps to justify\nenumerative induction; see the survey by Fitelson (2006). So objective\nBayesianism is often regarded as a substantive account of inductive\ninference, while many subjective Bayesians often take their view as a\nquantitative analogue of deductive logic (as presented in\n section 4.1).\n For refinement of Carnap\u2019s approach, see Maher (2004). The most\ncommon worry for Carnap\u2019s approach is that it renders the\nnormative import of the Indifference Principle too sensitive to the\nchoice of a language; for a reply, see J. Williamson (2010: chap. 9).\nFor more criticisms, see Kelly & Glymour (2004).\n\nThe Indifference Principle has been challenged for another reason.\nThis principle is often understood to dictate equal\nreal-valued credences in cases of ignorance, but there is the\nworry that sometimes we are too ignorant to be justified in having\nsharp, real-valued credences, as suggested by this case (Keynes 1921:\nch. 4):\n\n\n\n\nExample (Two Urns). Suppose that there are two\nurns, a and b. Urn a contains 10 balls. Exactly\nhalf of those are white; the other half, black. Urn b contains\n10 balls, each of which is either black or white, but we have no idea\nabout the white-to-black ratio. Those two urns are each shaken well. A\nball is to be drawn from each. What should our credences be in the\nfollowing propositions?\n\n (A) The ball from urn a is white.\n (B) The ball from urn b is white.\n \n\n\n\nBy the Principle of Indifference, the answers seems to be 0.5 and 0.5,\nrespectively. If so, there should be equal credences (namely 0.5) in\nA and in B. But this result sounds wrong to Keynes. He\nthinks that, compared with urn a, we have much less background\ninformation about urn b, and that this severe lack of\nbackground information should be reflected in the difference between\nthe doxastic attitudes toward propositions A and\nB\u2014a difference that the Principle of Indifference fails\nto make. If so, what is the difference? It is relatively\nuncontroversial that the credence in A should be 0.5, being the\nratio of the white balls in urn a (perhaps thanks to the\nPrincipal Principle). On the other hand, some Bayesians (Keynes 1921;\nJoyce 2005) argue that the credence in B does not have to be an\nindividual real number but, instead, is at least permitted to be\nunsharp, being the interval \\([0, 1]\\), which covers all the possible\nwhite-to-black ratios under consideration. This is only one motivation\nfor an interval account of unsharp credences; for another\nmotivation, see\n supplement A.\n\nIn reply to the Two Urns Case, objective Bayesians have defended one\nor another version of the Indifference Principle. White (2010) does it\nwhile maintaining that credences ought to be sharp. Weatherson (2007:\nsec. 4) defends a version that allows credences to be unsharp. Eva\n(2019) defends a version that governs comparative probabilities rather\nthan numerical credences. For more on this debate, see the survey by\nMahtani (2019) and the entry on\n imprecise probabilities.\n\nThe Principle of Indifference appears unhelpful when one has had\nsubstantive reason or evidence against some assignments of credences\n(making the principle inapplicable with a false if-clause). The\nstandard remedy appeals to a generalization of the Indifference\nPrinciple, called the Principle of Maximum Entropy (Jaynes\n1968); for more on this, see\n supplement D.\n\nThe above has only mentioned the versions of objective Bayesianism\nthat are more well-known in philosophy. There are other versions,\ndeveloped and discussed mostly by statisticians. For a survey, see\nKass & Wasserman (1996) and Berger (2006).\n4.3 Forward-Looking Bayesianism\n\nSome Bayesians propose that some norms for priors can be obtained by\nlooking into possible futures, with two steps (Good 1976):\n\n\nStep I (Think Ahead). Develop a normative\nconstraint C on the posteriors in some possible futures in\nwhich new evidence is acquired.\nStep II (Solve Backwards). Require one\u2019s\npriors to be such that, after conditionalization on new evidence, its\nposterior must satisfy C.\n\n\n\nFor lack of a standard name, this approach may be called\nforward-looking Bayesianism. This name is used here as an\numbrella term to cover different possible implementations, of which\ntwo are presented below.\n\nHere is one implementation. It might be held that one ought to favor a\nhypothesis if it explains the available evidence better than any other\ncompeting hypotheses do. This view is called inference to the best\nexplanation (IBE) if construed as a method for theory choice, as\noriginally developed in the epistemology of all-or-nothing beliefs\n(Harman 1986). It can be carried over to Bayesian epistemology as\nfollows:\n\n\nExplanationist Bayesianism (Preliminary\nVersion). One\u2019s prior ought to be such that, given each\nbody of evidence under consideration, a hypothesis that explains the\nevidence better has a higher posterior.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s stated here is only a preliminary version. More\nsophisticated versions are developed by Lipton (2004: ch. 7) and\nWeisberg (2009a). This view is resisted by some Bayesians to varying\ndegrees. van Fraassen (1989: ch. 7) argues that IBE should be rejected\nbecause it is in tension with the two core Bayesian norms. Okasha\n(2000) argues that IBE only serves as a good heuristic for guiding\none\u2019s credence change. Henderson (2014) argues that IBE need not\nbe assumed to guide one\u2019s credence change because it can be\njustified by little more than the two core Bayesian norms. For more on\nIBE, see the entry on\n abduction,\n in which sections 3.1 and 4 discuss explanationist Bayesianism.\n\nHere is another implementation of forward-looking Bayesianism. It\nmight be thought that, although a scientific method for theory choice\nis subject to error due to its inductive nature, it is supposed to be\nable, in a sense, to correct itself. This view is called the\nself-corrective thesis, originally developed in the epistemology\nof all-or-nothing beliefs by Peirce (1903) and Reichenbach (1938: sec.\n38\u201340). But it can be carried over to Bayesian epistemology as\nfollows:\n\n\nSelf-Correctionist Bayesianism (Preliminary\nVersion). One\u2019s prior ought, if possible, to have at least\nthe following self-corrective property in every possible state of the\nworld under consideration: one\u2019s posterior credence in the true\nhypothesis under consideration would eventually become high and stay\nso if the evidence were to accumulate indefinitely.\n\n\n\nAn early version of this view is developed by Freedman (1963) in\nstatistics; see Wasserman (1998: sec. 1\u20133) for a minimally\ntechnical overview. The self-corrective property concerns the long\nrun, so it invites the standard, Keynesian worry that the long run\nmight be too long. For replies, see Diaconis & Freedman (1986b:\npp. 63\u201364) and Kelly (2000: sec. 7). A related worry is that a\nlong-run norm puts no constraint on what matters, namely, our doxastic\nstates in the short run (Carnap 1945). A possible reply is that the\nself-corrective property is only a minimum qualification of\npermissible priors and can be conjoined with other norms for credences\nto generate a significant constraint on priors. To substantiate that\nreply, it has been argued that such a constraint on priors is actually\nstronger than what the rival Bayesians have to offer in some important\ncases of statistical inference (Diaconis & Freedman 1986a) and\nenumerative induction (Lin forthcoming).\n\nThe above two versions of forward-looking Bayesianism both encourage\nBayesians to do this: assimilate some ideas (such as IBE or\nself-correction) that have long been taken seriously in some\nnon-Bayesian traditions of epistemology. Forward-looking Bayesianism\nseems to be a convenient template for doing that.\n4.4 Connection to the Uniqueness Debate\n\nThe above approaches to the problem of the priors are mostly developed\nwith this question in mind:\n\n\nThe Question of Norms. What are the correct\nnorms that we can articulate to govern prior credences?\n\n\n\nThe interest in this question leads naturally to a different but\nclosely related question. Imagine that you are unsympathetic to\nsubjective Bayesianism. Then you might try to add one norm after\nanother to narrow down the candidate pool for the permissible priors,\nand you might be wondering what this process might end up with. This\nraises a more abstract question:\n\n\nThe Question of Uniqueness. Given each\npossible body of evidence, is there exactly one permissible credence\nassignment or doxastic state (whether or not we can articulate norms\nto single out that state)?\n\n\n\nImpermissive Bayesianism is the view that says\n\u201cyes\u201d; permissive Bayesianism says\n\u201cno\u201d. The question of uniqueness is often addressed in a\nway that is somewhat orthogonal to the question of norms, as is\nsuggested by the \u2018whether-or-not\u2019 clause in the\nparentheses. Moreover, the uniqueness question is often debated in a\nbroader context that considers not just credences but all possible\ndoxastic states, thus going beyond Bayesian epistemology. Readers\ninterested in the uniqueness question are referred to the survey by\nKopec and Titelbaum (2016).\n\nLet me close this section with some clarifications. The two terms\n\u2018objective Bayesianism\u2019 and \u2018impermissive\nBayesianism\u2019 are sometimes used interchangeably. But those two\nterms are used in the present entry to distinguish two different\nviews, and neither implies the other. For example, many prominent\nobjective Bayesians such as Carnap (1955), Jaynes (1968), and J.\nWilliamson (2010) are not committed to impermissivism, even though\nsome objective Bayesians tend to be sympathetic to impermissivism. For\nelaboration on the point just made, see\n supplement E.\n\n\n5. Issues about Diachronic Norms\n\nThe Principle of Conditionalization has been challenged with several\nputative counterexamples. This section will examine some of the most\ninfluential ones. We will see that, to save that principle, some\nBayesians have tried to refine it into one or another version. A\nnumber of versions have been systematically compared in papers such as\nthose of Meacham (2015, 2016), Pettigrew (2020b), and Rescorla (2021),\nwhile the emphasis below will be centered on the proposed\ncounterexamples.\n\n5.1 Old Evidence\n\nLet\u2019s start with the problem of old evidence, which was\npresented above (in the tutorial\n section 1.8)\n but is reproduced below for ease of reference:\n\n\nExample (Mercury). It is 1915. Einstein has\njust developed a new theory, General Relativity. He assesses the new\ntheory with respect to some old data that have been known for at least\nfifty years: the anomalous rate of the advance of Mercury\u2019s\nperihelion (which is the point on Mercury\u2019s orbit that is\nclosest to the Sun). After some derivations and calculations, Einstein\nsoon recognizes that his new theory entails the old data about the\nadvance of Mercury\u2019s perihelion, while the Newtonian theory does\nnot. Now, Einstein increases his credence in his new theory, and\nrightly so.\n\n\n\nThere appears to be no change in the body of Einstein\u2019s evidence\nwhen he is simply doing some derivations and calculations. But the\nlimiting case of no new evidence seems to be just the case in\nwhich the new evidence E is trivial, being a logical truth,\nruling out no possibilities. Now, conditionalization on new evidence\nE as a logical truth changes no credence; but Einstein changes\nhis credences nonetheless\u2014and rightly so. This is called the\nproblem of old evidence, formulated as a counterexample to the\nPrinciple of Conditionalization.\n\nTo save the Principle of Conditionalization, a standard reply is to\nnote that Einstein seems to discover something new, a logical\nfact:\n\n\n\\((E_\\textrm{logical})\\) The new theory, together with such and\nsuch auxiliary hypotheses, logically implies such and such old\nevidence.\n\n\n\nThe hope is that, once this proposition has a less-than-certain\ncredence, Einstein\u2019s credence change can then be explained and\njustified as a result of conditionalization on this proposition\n(Garber 1983, Jeffrey 1983, and Niiniluoto 1983). There are four\nworries about this approach.\n\nAn initial worry is that the discovery of the logical fact\n\\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\) does not sound like adding anything to the body\nof Einstein\u2019s evidence but seems only to make clear the\nevidential relation between the new theory and the existing,\nunaugmented body of evidence. If so, there is no new evidence after\nall. This worry might be addressed by providing a modified version of\nthe Conditionalization Principle, according to which the thing to be\nconditionalized on is not exactly what one acquires as new evidence\nbut, rather, what one learns. Indeed, it seems to sound\nnatural to say that Einstein learns something nontrivial from his\nderivations. For more on the difference between learning and acquiring\nevidence, see Maher (1992: secs 2.1 and 2.3). So this approach to the\nproblem of old evidence is often called logical learning.\n\nA second worry for the logical learning approach points to an internal\ntension: On the one hand, this approach has to work by permitting a\nless-than-certain credence in a logical fact such as\n\\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\), and that amounts to permitting one to make a\ncertain kind of logical error. On the other hand, this approach has\nbeen developed on the assumption of Probabilism, which seems to\nrequire that one be logically omniscient and make no logical error (as\nmentioned in the tutorial\n section 1.9).\n van Fraassen (1988) argues that these two aspects of the logical\nlearning approach contradict each other under some weak\nassumptions.\n\nA third worry is that the logical learning approach depends for its\nsuccess on certain questionable assumptions about prior credences. For\ncriticisms of those assumptions as well as possible improvements, see\nSprenger (2015), Hartmann & Fitelson (2015), and Eva &\nHartmann (2020).\n\nThere is a fourth worry, which deserves a subsection of its own.\n\n5.2 New Theory\n\nThe logical learning approach to the problem of old evidence invites\nanother worry. It seems to fail to address a variant of the Mercury\nCase, due to Earman (1992: sec. 5.5):\n\n\nExample (Physics Student). A physics student\njust started studying Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity.\nLike most physics students, the first thing she learns about the\ntheory, even before hearing any details of the theory itself, is the\nlogical fact \\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\) as formulated above. After\nlearning that, this student forms an initial credence 1 in\n\\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\), and an initial credence in the new,\nEinsteinian theory. She also lowers her credence in the old, Newtonian\ntheory.\n\n\n\nThe student\u2019s formation of a new, initial credence in\nthe new theory seems to pose a relatively little threat to the\nPrinciple of Conditionalization, which is most naturally construed as\na norm that governs, not credence formation, but credence change. So\nthe more serious problem lies in the student\u2019s change\nof her credence in the old theory. If this credence drop really\nresults from conditionalization on what was just learned,\n\\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\), then the credence in \\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\)\nmust be boosted to 1 from somewhere below 1, which unfortunately never\nhappens. So it seems that the student\u2019s credence drop violates\nthe Principle of Conditionalization and rightly so, which is known as\nthe problem of new theory. The following presents two reply\nstrategies for Bayesians.\n\nOne reply strategy is to qualify the Conditionalization Principle and\nmake it weaker in order to avoid counterexamples. The following is one\nway to implement this strategy (see\n supplement F\n for another one):\n\n\nThe Principle of Conditionalization (Plan/Rule\nVersion). It ought to be that, if one has a plan (or follows a\nrule) for changing credences in the case of learning E, then\nthe plan (or rule) is to conditionalize on E.\n\n\n\nNote how this version is immune from the Physics Student Case: what is\nlearned, \\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\), is something entirely new to the\nstudent, so the student simply did not have in mind a plan for\nresponding to \\(E_\\textrm{logical}\\)\u2014so the if-clause is not\nsatisfied. The Bayesians who adopt this version, such as van Fraassen\n(1989: ch. 7), often add that one is not required to have a\nplan for responding to any particular piece of new evidence.\n\nThe plan version is independently motivated. Note that this version\nputs a normative constraint on the plan that one has at\neach time when one has a plan, whereas the standard version\nconstrains the act of credence change across different\ntimes. So the plan version is different from the standard, act\nversion. But it turns out to be the former, rather then the latter,\nthat is supported by the major existing arguments for the Principle of\nConditionalization. See, for example, the Dutch Book argument by Lewis\n(1999), the expected accuracy argument by Greaves & Wallace\n(2006), and the accuracy dominance argument by Briggs & Pettigrew\n(2020).\n\nWhile the plan version of the Conditionalization Principle is weak\nenough to avoid the Physics Student counterexample, it might be\nworried that it is too weak. There are actually two worries here. The\nfirst worry is that the plan version is too weak because it leaves\nopen an important question: Even if one\u2019s plan for credence\nchange is always a plan to conditionalize on new evidence, should one\nactually follow such a plan whenever new evidence is acquired? For\ndiscussions of this issue, see Levi (1980: ch. 4), van Fraassen (1989:\nch. 7), and Titelbaum (2013a: parts III and IV). (Terminological note:\ninstead of \u2018plan\u2019, Levi uses \u2018confirmational\ncommitment\u2019 and van Fraassen uses \u2018rule\u2019.) The\nsecond worry is that the plan version is too weak because it only\navoids the problem of new theory, without giving a positive account as\nto why the student\u2019s credence in the old theory ought to\ndrop.\n\nA positive account is promised by the next strategy for solving the\nproblem of new theory. It operates with a series of ideas. The first\nidea is that, typically, a person only considers possibilities that\nare not jointly exhaustive, and she only has credences\nconditional on the set C of the considered\npossibilities\u2014lacking an unconditional credence in C\n(Shimony 1970; Salmon 1990). This deviates from the standard Bayesian\nview in allowing two things: credence gaps\n (section 3.1),\n and primitive conditional credences\n (section 3.4).\n The second idea is that the set C of the considered\npossibilities might shrink or expand in time. It might shrink because\nsome of those possibilities are ruled out by new evidence, or it might\nexpand because a new possibility\u2014a new theory\u2014is taken\ninto consideration. The third and last idea is a diachronic norm\n(sketched by Shimony 1970 and Salmon 1990, developed in detail by\nWenmackers & Romeijn 2016):\n\n\nThe Principle of Generalized Conditionalization\n(Considered Possibilities Version). It ought to be that, if two\npossibilities are under consideration at an earlier time and remain so\nat a later time, then their credence ratio be preserved across those\ntwo times.\n\n\n\nHere, a credence ratio has to be understood in such a way that it can\nexist without any unconditional credence. To see how this is possible,\nsuppose for simplicity that an agent starts with two old theories as\nthe only possibilities under consideration, \\(\\mathsf{old}_1\\) and\n\\(\\mathsf{old}_2\\), with a credence ratio \\(1:2\\) but without any\nunconditional credence. This can be understood to mean that, while the\nagent lacks an unconditional credence in the set \\(\\{\\mathsf{old}_1 ,\n\\mathsf{old}_2\\}\\), she still has a conditional credence\n\\(\\frac{1}{1+2}\\) in \\(\\mathsf{old}_1\\) given that set. Now, suppose\nthat this agent then thinks of a new theory: \\(\\mathsf{new}\\). Then,\nby the diachronic norm stated above, the credence ratio among\n\\(\\mathsf{old}_1\\), \\(\\mathsf{old}_2\\), \\(\\mathsf{new}\\) should now be\n\\(1:2:x\\). Notice the change of this agent\u2019s conditional\ncredence in \\(\\mathsf{old}_1\\) given the varying set of the\nconsidered possibilities: it drops from \\(\\frac{1}{1+2}\\) down to\n\\(\\frac{1}{1+2+x}\\), provided that \\(x>0\\). Wenmackers &\nRomeijn (2016) argues that this is why there appears to be a drop in\nthe student\u2019s credence in the old theory\u2014it is actually a\ndrop in a conditional credence given the varying set of the considered\npossibilities.\n\nThe above account invites a worry from the perspective of rational\nchoice theory. According to the standard construal of Bayesian\ndecision theory, the kind of doxastic state that ought to enter\ndecision-making is unconditional credence rather than\nconditional credence. So Earman (1992: sec. 7.3) is led to think that\nwhat we really need is an epistemology for unconditional\ncredence, which the above account fails to provide. A possible reply\nis anticipated by some Bayesian decision theorists, such as Savage\n(1972: sec. 5.5) and Harsanyi (1985). They argue that, when making a\ndecision, we often only have conditional credences\u2014conditional\non a simplifying assumption that makes the decision problem in\nquestion manageable. For other Bayesian decision theorists who follow\nSavage and Harsanyi, see the references in Joyce (1999: sec. 2.6, 4.2,\n5.5 and 7.1). For more on rational choice theory, see the entry on\n decision theory\n and the entry on\n normative theories of rational choice: expected utility.\n\n5.3 Uncertain Learning\n\nWhen we change our credences, the Principle of Conditionalization\nrequires us to raise the credence in some proposition, such as the\ncredence in the new evidence, all the way to 1. But it seems that we\noften have credence changes that do not accompany such as a radical\nrise to certainty, as witnessed by the following case:\n\n\nExample (Mudrunner). A gambler is very\nconfident that a certain racehorse, called Mudrunner, performs\nexceptionally well on muddy courses. A look at the extremely cloudy\nsky has an immediate effect on this gambler\u2019s opinion: an\nincrease in her credence in the proposition \\((\\textsf{muddy})\\) that\nthe course will be muddy\u2014an increase without reaching\ncertainty. Then this gambler raises her credence in the hypothesis\n\\((\\textsf{win})\\) that Mudrunner will win the race, but nothing\nbecomes fully certain. (Jeffrey 1965 [1983: sec. 11.3])\n\n\n\nConditionalization is too inflexible to accommodate this case.\n\nJeffrey proposes a now-standard solution that replaces\nconditionalization by a more flexible process for credence change,\ncalled Jeffrey conditionalization. Recall that\nconditionalization has a defining feature: it preserves the credence\nratios of the possibilities inside new evidence E while the\ncredence in E is raised all the way to 1. Jeffrey\nconditionalization does something similar: it preserves the same\ncredence ratios without having to raise any credence to 1,\nand also preserves some other credence ratios, i.e., the\ncredence ratios of the possibilities outside E. A simple\nversion of Jeffrey\u2019s norm can be stated informally as follows\n(in the style of the tutorial\n section 1.2):\n\n\n\n\nThe Principle of Jeffrey Conditionalization (Simplified\nVersion). It ought to be that, if the direct experiential impact\non one\u2019s credences causes the credence in E to rise to a\nreal number e (which might be less than 1), then one\u2019s\ncredences are changed as follows:\n\nFor the possibilities inside E, rescale their credences\nupward by a common factor so that they sum to e; for the\npossibilities outside E, rescale their credences downward by a\ncommon factor so that they sum to \\(1-e\\) (to obey the rule of\nSum-to-One).\nReset the credence in each proposition H by adding up the\nnew credences in the possibilities inside H (to obey the rule\nof Additivity).\n \n\n\n\nThis reduces to standard conditionalization in the special case that\n\\(e = 1\\). The above formulation is quite simplified; see\n supplement G\n for a general statement. This principle has been defended with a\nDutch Book argument; see Armendt (1980) and Skyrms (1984) for\ndiscussions.\n\nJeffrey conditionalization is flexible enough to accommodate the\nMudrunner Case. Suppose that the immediate effect of the\ngambler\u2019s sky-looking experience is to raise the credence in\n\\(E\\), i.e. \\(\\Cr(\\mathsf{muddy})\\). One feature of Jeffrey\nconditionalization is that, since certain credence ratios are required\nto be held constant, one has to hold constant the conditional\ncredences given \\(E\\) and also those given \\(\\neg E\\), such as\n\\(\\Cr(\\mathsf{win} \\mid \\mathsf{muddy})\\) and \\(\\Cr(\\mathsf{win} \\mid\n\\neg\\mathsf{muddy})\\). The credences mentioned above can be used to\nexpress \\(\\Cr(\\mathsf{win})\\) as follows (thanks to Probabilism and\nthe Ratio Formula): \n\\[\\begin{multline}\n        \\Cr(\\mathsf{win}) = \\underbrace{\\Cr(\\mathsf{win} \\mid \\mathsf{muddy})}_\\textrm{high, held constant} \\wcdot \\underbrace{\\Cr(\\mathsf{muddy})}_\\textrm{raised} \n    \\\\\n      {}  + \n        \\underbrace{\\Cr(\\mathsf{win} \\mid \\neg\\mathsf{muddy})}_\\textrm{low, held constant} \\wcdot \\underbrace{\\Cr(\\neg\\mathsf{muddy})}_\\textrm{lowered}.\n    \\end{multline}\\]\n\n\nIt seems natural to suppose that the first conditional credence is\nhigh and the second is low, by the description of the Mudrunner Case.\nThe annotations in the above equation imply that \\(\\Cr(\\mathsf{win})\\)\nmust go up. This is how Jeffrey conditionalization accommodates the\nMudrunner Case.\n\nAlthough Jeffrey conditionalization is more flexible than\nconditionalization, there is the worry that it is still too inflexible\ndue to something it inherits from conditionalization: the preservation\nof certain credence ratios or conditional credences (Bacchus, Kyburg,\n& Thalos 1990; Weisberg 2009b). Here is an example due to Weisberg\n(2009b: sec. 5):\n\n\n\n\nExample (Red Jelly Bean). An agent with a prior\n\\(\\Cr_\\textrm{old}\\) has a look at a jelly bean. The reddish\nappearance of that jelly bean has only one immediate effect on this\nagent\u2019s credences: an increased credence in the proposition\nthat\n\n\\((\\textsf{red})\\)\n there is a red jelly bean.\n\n\nThen this agent comes to have a posterior \\(\\Cr_\\textrm{new}\\). If\nthis agent later learns that\n\n\\((\\textsf{tricky})\\)\n the lighting is tricky,\n\n\nher credence in the redness of the jelly bean will drop. So,\n\n(\\(a\\))\n \\(\\Cr_\\textrm{new}( \\textsf{red} \\mid \\textsf{tricky} ) <\n\\Cr_\\textrm{new}( \\textsf{red} )\\).\n\n\nBut if, instead, the tricky lighting had been learned before\nthe look at the jelly bean, it would not have changed the credence in\nthe jelly bean\u2019s redness; that is:\n\n(\\(b\\))\n\\(\\Cr_\\textrm{old}( \\textsf{red} \\mid \\textsf{tricky} ) =\n\\Cr_\\textrm{old}( \\textsf{red} ).\\)\n \n\n\n\nYet it can be proved (with elementary probability theory) that\n\\(\\Cr_\\textrm{new}\\) cannot be obtained from \\(\\Cr_\\textrm{old}\\) by a\nJeffrey conditionalization on \\(\\textsf{red}\\) (assuming the two\nconditions \\((a)\\) and \\((b)\\) in the above case, the Ratio Formula,\nand that \\(\\Cr_\\textrm{old}\\) is probabilistic). See\n supplement H\n for a sketch of proof.\n\nThe above example is used by Weisberg (2009b) not just to argue\nagainst the Principle of Jeffrey Conditionalization, but also to\nillustrate a more general point: that principle is in tension with an\ninfluential thesis called confirmational holism, most\nfamously defended by Duhem (1906) and Quine (1951). Confirmational\nholism says roughly that how one should revise one\u2019s beliefs\ndepends on a good deal of one\u2019s background opinions\u2014such\nas the opinions about the quality of the lighting, the reliability of\none\u2019s vision, the details of one\u2019s experimental setup\n(which are conjoined with a tested scientific theory to predict\nexperimental outcomes). In reply, Konek (forthcoming) develops and\ndefends an even more flexible version of conditionalization, flexible\nenough to be compatible with confirmational holism. For more on\nconfirmational holism, see the entry on\n underdetermination of scientific theory\n and the survey by Ivanova (2021).\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of Jeffrey conditionalization, see the\nsurveys by Joyce (2011: sec. 3.2 and 3.3) and Weisberg (2011: sec. 3.4\nand 3.5).\n\n\n\n5.4 Memory Loss\n\nConditionalization in the standard version preserves certainties,\nwhich fails to accommodate cases of memory loss (Talbott 1991):\n\n\nExample (Dinner). At 6:30 PM on March 15,\n1989, Bill is certain that he is having spaghetti for dinner that\nnight. But by March 15 of the next year, Bill has completely forgotten\nwhat he had for dinner one year ago.\n\n\n\nThere are even putative counterexamples that appear to be\nworse\u2014with an agent who faces only the danger of memory loss\nrather than actual memory loss. Here is one such example (Arntzenius\n2003):\n\n\nExample (Shangri-La). A traveler has reached a\nfork in the road to Shangri-La. The guardians will flip a fair coin to\ndetermine her path. If it comes up heads, she will travel the path by\nthe Mountains and correctly remember that all along. If instead it\ncomes up tails, she will travel by the Sea\u2014with her memory\naltered upon reaching Shangri-La so that she will incorrectly remember\nhaving traveled the path by the Mountains. So, either way, once in\nShangri-La the traveler will remember having traveled the path by the\nMountains. The guardians explain this entire arrangement to the\ntraveler, who believes those words with certainty. It turns out that\nthe coin comes up heads. So the traveler travels the path by the\nMountains and has credence 1 that she does. But once she reaches\nShangri-La and recalls the guardians\u2019 words, that credence\nsuddenly drops from 1 down to 0.5.\n\n\n\nThat credence drop violates the Principle of Conditionalization, and\nall that happens without any actual loss of memory.\n\nIt may be replied that conditionalization can be plausibly generalized\nto accommodate the above case. Here is an attempt made by Titelbaum\n(2013a: ch. 6), who develops an idea that can be traced back to Levi\n(1980: sec. 4.3):\n\n\nThe Principle of Generalized Conditionalization\n(Certainties Version). It ought to be that, if two considered\npossibilities each entail one\u2019s certainties at an earlier time\nand continue to do so at a later time, then their credence ratio are\npreserved across those two times.\n\n\n\nThis norm allows the set of one\u2019s certainties to expand or\nshrink, while incorporating the core idea of conditionalization:\npreservation of credence ratios. To see how this norm accommodates the\nShangri-La Case, assume for simplicity that the traveler starts at the\ninitial time with a set of certainties, which expands upon seeing the\ncoin toss result at a later time, but shrinks back to the\noriginal set of certainties upon reaching Shangri-La at the\nfinal time. Note that there is no change in one\u2019s certainties\nacross the initial time and the final time. So, by the above norm,\none\u2019s credences at the final time (upon reaching Shangri-La)\nshould be identical to those at the initial time (the start of the\ntrip). In particular, one\u2019s final credence in traveling the path\nby the Mountains should be the same as the initial credence, which is\n0.5. For more on the attempts to save conditionalization from cases of\nactual or potential memory loss, see Meacham (2010), Moss (2012), and\nTitelbaum (2013a: ch. 6 and 7).\n\nThe Principle of Generalized Conditionalization, as stated above,\nmight be thought to be an incomplete diachronic norm because it leaves\nopen the question of how one\u2019s certainties ought to change.\nEarly attempts at a positive answer are due to Harper (1976, 1978) and\nLevi (1980: ch. 1\u20134). Their ideas are developed independently of\nthe issue of memory loss, but are motivated by the scenarios in which\nan agent finds a need to revise or even retract what she used to take\nto be her evidence. Although Harper\u2019s and Levi\u2019s\napproaches are not identical, they share the common idea that\none\u2019s certainties ought to change under the constraint of\ncertain diachronic axioms, now known as the AGM axioms in the\nbelief revision\n literature.[9]\n For some reasons against the Harper-Levi approach to norms of\ncertainty change, see Titelbaum (2013a: sec. 7.4.1).\n5.5 Self-Locating Credences\n\nOne\u2019s self-locating credences are, for example,\ncredences about who one is, where one is, and what time it is. Such\ncredences pose some challenges to conditionalization. Let me mention\ntwo below.\n\nTo begin with, consider the following case, adapted from Titelbaum\n(2013a: ch. 12):\n\n\nExample (Writer). At \\(t_1\\) it\u2019s midday\non Wednesday, and a writer is sitting in an office finishing a\nmanuscript for a publisher, with a deadline by the end of next day,\nbeing certain that she only has three more sections to go. Then, at\n\\(t_2\\), she notices that it gets dark out\u2014in fact, she has lost\nsense of time because of working too hard, and she is now only sure\nthat it is either Wednesday evening or early Thursday morning. She\nalso notices that she has only got one section done since the midday.\nSo the writer utters to herself: \u201cNow, I still have two more\nsections to go\u201d. That is the new evidence for her to change\ncredences.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that it is not immediately clear what exactly is the\nproposition E that the writer should conditionalize on. The\nright E appears to be the proposition expressed by the\nwriter\u2019s utterance: \u201cNow, I still have two more sections\nto go\u201d. And the expressed proposition must be one of the\nfollowing two candidates, depending on when the utterance is actually\nmade (assuming the standard account of indexicals, due to Kaplan\n1989):\n\n\\((A)\\)\n The writer still has two more sections to go on Wednesday\nevening.\n\n\n\\((B)\\) \n The writer still has two more sections to go on early Thursday\nMorning.\n\n\nBut, with the lost sense of time, it also seems that the writer should\nconditionalize on a less informative body of evidence: the disjunction\n\\(A \\vee B\\). So exactly what should she conditionalize on? \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\), or \\(A \\vee B\\)? See Titelbaum (2016) for a survey of some\nproposed solutions to this problem.\n\nWhile the previous problem concerns only the inputs that should be\npassed to the conditionalization process, conditionalization itself is\nchallenged when self-locating credences meet the danger of memory\nloss. Consider the following case, made popular in epistemology by\nElga (2000):\n\n\nExample (Sleeping Beauty). Sleeping Beauty\nparticipates in an experiment. She knows for sure that she will be\ngiven a sleeping pill that induces limited amnesia. She knows for sure\nthat, after she falls asleep, a fair coin will be flipped. If it lands\nheads, she will be awakened on Monday and asked: \u201cHow confident\nare you that the coin landed heads?\u201d. She will not be informed\nwhich day it is. If the coin lands tails, she will be awaken on both\nMonday and on Tuesday and asked the same question each time. The\namnesia effect is designed to ensure that, if awakened on Tuesday she\nwill not remember being woken on Monday. And Sleeping Beauty knows all\nthat for sure.\n\n\n\nWhat should her answer be when she is awakened on Monday and asked how\nconfident she is in the coin\u2019s landing heads? Lewis (2001)\nemploys the Principle of Conditionalization to argue that the answer\nis \\(1/2\\). His reasoning proceeds as follows: Sleeping Beauty, upon\nher awakening, acquires no new evidence or acquires only a piece of\nnew evidence that she is already certain of, so by conditionalization\nher credence in the coin\u2019s landing heads ought to remain the\nsame as it was before the sleep: \\(1/2\\).\n\nBut Elga (2000) argues that the answer is \\(1/3\\) rather than \\(1/2\\).\nIf so, that will seem to be a counterexample to the Principle of\nConditionalization. Here is a sketch of his argument. Imagine that we\nare Sleeping Beauty and reason as follows. We just woke up, and there\nare only three possibilities on the table, regarding how the coin\nlanded and what day it is today:\n\n\\((A)\\)\n Heads and it\u2019s Monday.\n\n\n\\((B)\\) \n Tails and it\u2019s Monday.\n\n\n\\((C)\\) \nTails and it\u2019s Tuesday.\n\n\nIf we are told that it\u2019s Monday (\\(A \\vee B\\)), we will judge\nthat the coin\u2019s landing heads (\\(A\\)) is as probable as its\nlanding tails (\\(B\\)). So \n\\[\\Cr(A \\mid A \\vee B) = \\Cr(B \\mid A \\vee B) = 1/2.\\]\n\n\nIf we are told that it lands tails (\\(B \\vee C\\)), we will judge that\ntoday being Monday (\\(B\\)) and today being Tuesday (\\(C\\)) are equally\nprobable. So  \n\\[\\Cr(B \\mid B \\vee C) = \\Cr(C \\mid B \\vee C) = 1/2.\\]\n\n\nThe only way to meet the above conditions is to distribute the\nunconditional credences evenly:  \n\\[\\Cr(A) = \\Cr(B) = \\Cr(C) = 1/3.\\]\n\n\nHence the credence in landing heads, \\(A\\), is equal to \\(1/3\\), or so\nElga concludes. This result seems to challenge the Principle of\nConditionalization, which recommends the answer \\(1/2\\) as explained\nabove. For more on the Sleeping Beauty problem, see the survey by\nTitelbaum (2013b).\n5.6 Bayesianism without Kinematics\n\nConfronted with the existing problems for the Principle of\nConditionalization, some Bayesians turn away from any diachronic norm\nand develop another variety of Bayesianism: time-slice\nBayesianism. On this view, what credences you should (or may)\nhave at any particular time depend solely on the total\nevidence you have at that same time\u2014independently of your\nearlier credences. To specify this dependency relation is to specify\nexclusively synchronic norms\u2014and to forget about diachronic\nnorms. Strictly speaking, there is still a diachronic norm, but it is\nderived rather than fundamental: when the time flows from \\(t\\) to\n\\(t'\\), your credences ought to change in a certain way\u2014they\nought to change to the credences that you ought to have with respect\nto your total evidence at the latter time \\(t'\\)\u2014and the earlier\ntime \\(t\\) is to be ignored. Any diachronic norm, if correct, is at\nmost an epiphenomenon that arises when correct synchronic norms are\napplied repeatedly across different times, according to time-slice\nBayesianism. (This view is stated above in terms of one\u2019s total\nevidence, but that can be replaced by one\u2019s total reasons or\ninformation.)\n\nA particular version of this view is held by J. Williamson (2010: ch.\n4), who is so firmly an objective Bayesian that he argues that the\nPrinciple of Conditionalization should be rejected if it is in\nconflict with repeated applications of certain synchronic norms, such\nas Probabilism and the Principle of Maximum Entropy (which generalizes\nthe Principle of Indifference; see\n supplement D).\n Time-slice Bayesianism as a general position is developed and\ndefended by Hedden (2015a, 2015b).\n\n\n6. The Problem of Idealization\n\nA worry about Bayesian epistemology is that the two core Bayesian\nnorms are so demanding that they can be followed only by highly\nidealized agents\u2014being logically omniscient, with\nprecise credences that always fit together\nperfectly. This is the problem of idealization, which was\npresented in the tutorial\n section 1.9.\n This section surveys three reply strategies for Bayesians, which\nmight complement each other. As will become clear below, the work on\nthis problem is quite interdisciplinary, with contributions from\nepistemologists as well as scientists and other philosophers.\n6.1 De-idealization and Understanding\n\nOne reply to the problem of idealization is to look at how idealized\nmodels are used and valued in science, and to argue that certain\nvalues of idealization can be carried over to epistemology. When a\nscientist studies a complex system, she might not really need an\naccurate description of it but might rather want to pursue the\nfollowing:\n\nsome simplified, idealized models of the whole (such as a block\nsliding on a frictionless, perfectly flat plane in vacuum);\ngradual de-idealizations of the above (such as adding more and\nmore realistic considerations about friction);\nan articulated reason why de-idealizations should be done this way\nrather than another to improve upon the simpler models.\n\n\nParts 1 and 2 do not have to be ladders that will be kicked away once\nwe reach a more realistic model. Instead, the three parts, 1\u20133,\nmight work together to help the scientist achieve a deeper\nunderstanding of the complex system under study\u2014a kind of\nunderstanding that an accurate description (alone) does not provide.\nThe above is one of the alleged values of idealized models in\nscientific modeling; for more, see section 4.2 of the entry on\n understanding\n and the survey by Elliott-Graves and Weisberg (2014: sec. 3). Some\nBayesians have argued that certain values of idealization are\napplicable not just in science but also in epistemology (Howson 2000:\n173\u2013177; Titelbaum 2013a: ch. 2\u20135; Schupbach 2018). For\nmore on the values of building more or less idealized models not just\nin epistemology but generally in philosophy, see T. Williamson\n(2017).\n\nThe above reply to the problem of idealization has been reinforced by\na sustained project of de-idealization in Bayesian epistemology. The\nfollowing gives you the flavor of how this project may be pursued.\nLet\u2019s start with the usual complaint that Probabilism\nimplies:\n\n\nStrong Normalization. An agent ought to assign\ncredence 1 to every logical truth.\n\n\n\nThe worry is that a person can meet this demand only by luck or with\nan unrealistic ability\u2014the ability to demarcate all logical\ntruths from the other propositions. But some Bayesians argue that the\nstandard version of Probabilism can be suitably de-idealized to obtain\na weak version that does not imply Strong Normalization. For example,\nthe extensibility version of Probabilism (discussed in\n section 3.1)\n permits one to have credence gaps and, thus, have no credence in any\nlogical truth (de Finetti 1970 [1974]; Jeffrey 1983; Zynda 1996).\nIndeed, the extensibility version of Probabilism only implies:\n\n\nWeak Normalization. It ought to be that, if an\nagent has a credence in a logical truth, that credence is equal to\n1.\n\n\n\nSome Bayesians have tried to de-idealize Probabilism further, to set\nit free from the commitment that any credence ought to be as sharp as\nan individual real number, precise to every digit. For example, Walley\n(1991: ch. 2 and 3) develops a version of Probabilism according to\nwhich a credence is permitted to be unsharp in this way. A credence\ncan be bounded by one or another interval of real numbers\nwithout being equal to any particular real number or any\nparticular interval\u2014even the tightest bound on a credence can be\nan incomplete description of that credence. This\ninterval-bound approach gives rise to a Dutch Book argument for an\neven weaker version of Probabilism, which only implies:\n\n\nVery Weak Normalization. It ought to be that,\nif an agent has a credence in a logical truth, then that credence is\nbounded only by intervals that include 1.\n\n\n\nSee\n supplement A\n for some non-technical details. For more details and related\ncontroversies, see the survey by Mahtani (2019) and the entry on\n imprecise probabilities.\n\nThe above are just some of the possible steps that might be taken in\nthe Bayesian project of de-idealization. There are more: Can Bayesians\nprovide norms for agents who can lose memories and forget what they\nused to take as certain? See Meacham (2010), Moss (2012), and\nTitelbaum (2013a: ch. 6 and 7) for positive accounts; also see\n section 5.4\n for discussion. Can Bayesians develop norms for agents who are\nsomewhat incoherent and incapable of being perfectly coherent? See\nStaffel (2019) for a positive account. Can Bayesians provide norms\neven for agents who are so cognitively underpowered that they only\nhave all-or-nothing beliefs without a numerical credence? See Lin\n(2013) for a positive account. Can Bayesians develop norms that\nexplain how one may be rationally uncertain whether one is rational?\nSee Dorst (2020) for a positive account. Can Bayesians develop a\ndiachronic norm for cognitively bounded agents? See Huttegger (2017a,\n2017b) for a positive account.\n\nWhile the project of de-idealization can be pursued gradually and\nincrementally as illustrated above, Bayesians disagree about how far\nthis project should be pursued. Some Bayesians want to push it\nfurther: they think that Very Weak Normalization is still too strong\nto be plausible, so Probabilism needs to be abandoned altogether and\nreplaced by a norm that permits credences less than 1 in logical\ntruths. For example, Garber (1983) tries to do that for certain\nlogical truths; Hacking (1967) and Talbott (2016), for all logical\ntruths. On the other hand, Bayesians of the more traditional variety\nretain a more or less de-idealized version of Probabilism, and try to\ndefend it by clarifying its normative content, to which I now\nturn.\n6.2 Striving for Ideals\n\nProbabilism is often thought to have a counterexample to this effect:\nit implies that we should meet a very high standard, but it is not the\ncase that we should, because we cannot. In reply, some Bayesians hold\nthat this is actually not a counterexample, and that the apparent\ncounterexample can be explained away once an appropriate reading of\n\u2018ought\u2019 is in place and clearly distinguished from another\nreading.\n\nTo see that there are two readings of \u2018ought\u2019, think about\nthe following scenario. Suppose that this is true:\n\n\n (i) We ought to launch a war now.\n\n\n\nThe truth of this particular norm might sound like a counterexample to\nthe general norm below:\n\n\n (ii) There ought to be no war.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps there can be a context in which (i) and (ii) are both true\nand hence the former is not a counterexample to the latter. An example\nis the context in which we know for sure that we are able to launch a\nwar that ends all existing wars. Indeed, the occurrences of\n\u2018ought\u2019 in those two sentences seem to have very different\nreadings. Sentence (ii) can be understood to express a norm which\nportrays what the state of the world ought to be\nlike\u2014what the world would be like if things were ideal.\nSuch a norm is often called an ought-to-be norm or\nevaluative norm, pointing to one or another ideal. On the\nother hand, sentence (i) can be understood as a norm which specifies\nwhat an agent ought to do in a less-than-ideal situation that\nshe turns out to be in\u2014possibly with the goal to improve the\nexisting situation and bring it closer to the ideal specified by an\nought-to-be norm, or at least to prevent the situation from getting\nworse. This kind of norm is often called an ought-to-do norm,\na deliberative norm, or a prescriptive norm. So,\nalthough the truth of (i) can sound like a counterexample to (ii), the\ntension between the two seems to disappear with appropriate readings\nof \u2018ought\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, suppose that an ordinary human has some incoherent\ncredences, and that it is not the case that she ought to remove the\nincoherence right away because she has not detected the incoherence.\nThe norm just stated can be thought of as an ought-to-do norm and,\nhence, need not be taken as a counterexample to Probabilism construed\nas an ought-to-be norm:\n\n\nProbabilism (Ought-to-Be Version). It\nought to be that one\u2019s credences fit together in the\nprobabilistic way.\n\n\n\nThe ought-to-be reading of \u2018ought\u2019 has been employed\nimplicitly or explicitly to defend Bayesian norms\u2014not just by\nBayesian philosophers (Zynda 1996; Christensen 2004: ch. 6; Titelbaum\n2013a: ch. 3 and 4; Wedgwood 2014; Eder forthcoming), but also by\nBayesian psychologists (Baron 2012). The distinction between the\nought-to-be and the ought-to-do oughts is most often defended in the\nbroader context of normative studies, such as in deontic logic\n(Casta\u00f1eda 1970; Horty 2001: sec. 3.3 and 3.4) and in\nmetaethics (Broome 1999; Wedgwood 2006; Schroeder 2011).\n\nThe ought-to-be construal of Probabilism still leaves us a\nprescriptive issue: How should a person go about detecting and fixing\nthe incoherence of one\u2019s credences, noting that it is absurd to\nstrive for coherence at all costs? This is an issue about\nought-to-do/prescriptive norms, addressed by a prescriptive research\nprogram in an area of psychology called judgment and decision\nmaking. For a survey of that area, see Baron (2004, 2012) and\nElqayam & Evans (2013). In fact, many psychologists even think\nthat, for better or worse, this prescriptive program has become the\n\u201cnew paradigm\u201d in the psychology of reasoning; for\nreferences, see Elqayam & Over (2013).\n\nThe prescriptive issue mentioned above raises some other questions.\nThere is an empirical, computational question: What is the\nextent to which a human brain can approximate the Bayesian ideal of\nsynchronic and diachronic coherence? See Griffiths, Kemp, &\nTenenbaum (2008) for a survey of some recent results. And there are\nphilosophical questions: Why is it epistemically better for a\nhuman\u2019s credences to be less incoherent? Speaking of being\nless incoherent, how can we develop a measure of degrees of\nincoherence? See de Bona & Staffel (2018) and Staffel (2019) for\nproposals.\n6.3 Applications Empowered by Idealization\n\nThere is a third approach to the problem of idealization: to some\nBayesians, some aspects of the Bayesian idealization are to be\nutilized rather than removed, because it is those aspects of\nidealization that empower certain important applications of\nBayesian epistemology in science. Here is the idea. Consider a human\nscientist confronted with an empirical problem. When some hypotheses\nhave been stated for consideration and some data have been collected,\nthere remains an inferential task\u2014the task of inferring from the\ndata to one of the hypotheses. This inferential task can be done by\nhuman scientists alone, but it has been done increasingly often this\nway: by developing a computer program (in Bayesian statistics) to\nsimulate an idealized Bayesian agent as if that agent were hired to\nperform the inferential task. The purpose of this inferential task\nwould be undermined if what is simulated by the computer were a\ncognitively underpowered agent who mimics the limited capacities of\nhuman agents. Howson (1992: sec. 6) suggests that this inferential\ntask is what Bayesian epistemology and Bayesian statistics were mainly\ndesigned for at the early stages of their development. See Fienberg\n(2006) for the historical development of Bayesian statistics.\n\nSo, on the above view, idealization is essential to the existing\napplications of Bayesian epistemology in science. If so, the real\nissue is whether the kind of scientific inquiry empowered by\nBayesian idealization serves the purpose of the inferential task\nbetter than do the non-Bayesian rivals, such as so-called\nfrequentism and likelihoodism in statistics. For a\ncritical comparison of those three schools of thought about\nstatistical inference, see Sober (2008: ch. 1), Hacking (2016), and\nthe entry on\n philosophy of statistics.\n For an introduction to both Bayesian statistics and frequentist\nstatistics written for philosophers, see Howson & Urbach (2006:\nch. 5\u20138).\n\n\n7. Closing: The Expanding Territory of Bayesianism\n\nBayesian epistemology, despite the problems presented above, has been\nexpanding its scope of application. In addition to the more standard,\nolder areas of application listed in\n section 1.3,\n the newer ones can be found in the entry on\n epistemic self-doubt,\n sections 5.1 and 5.4 of the entry on\n disagreement,\n Adler (2006 [2017]: sec. 6.3), and sections 3.6 and 4 of the entry on\n social epistemology.\n\nIn their more recent works, Bayesians have also started to contribute\nto some epistemological issues that have traditionally been among the\nmost central concerns for many non-Bayesians, especially for those\nimmersed in the epistemology of all-or-nothing beliefs. I wish to\nclose by giving four groups of examples.\n\n Skeptical Challenges: Central to traditional\nepistemology is the issue of how to address certain skeptical\nchallenges. The Cartesian skeptic thinks that we are not justified in\nbelieving that we are not a brain in a vat. Huemer (2016) and Shogenji\n(2018) have each developed a Bayesian argument against this variety of\nskepticism. There is also the Pyrrhonian skeptic, who holds the view\nthat no belief can be justified due to the regress problem of\njustification: once a belief is justified with a reason, that reason\nis in need of justification, too, which kickstarts a regress. An\nattempt to reply to this skeptic quickly leads to a difficult choice\namong three positions: first, foundationalism (roughly, that the\nregress can be stopped); second, coherentism (roughly, that it is\npermissible for the regress of justifications to be circular); and\nthird, infinitism (roughly, that it is permissible for the regress of\njustifications to extend ad infinitum). To that issue\nBayesians have made some contributions. For example, White (2006)\ndevelops a Bayesian argument against an influential version of\nfoundationalism, followed by a reply from Weatherson (2007); for more,\nsee\n section 3.2 of the entry on formal epistemology.\n Klein & Warfield (1994) develop a probabilistic argument against\ncoherentism, which initiates a debate joined by many Bayesians; for\nmore, see\n section 7 of the entry on coherentist theories of epistemic justification.\n Peijnenburg (2007) defends infinitism by developing a Bayesian\nversion of it. For more on the Cartesian and Pyrrhonian skeptical\nviews, see the entry on\n skepticism.\n Theories of Knowledge and Justified Beliefs:\nWhile traditional epistemologists praise knowledge and have\nextensively studied what turns a belief into knowledge, Moss (2013,\n2018) develops a Bayesian counterpart: she argues that a credence can\nalso be knowledge-like, a property that can be studied by Bayesians.\nTraditional epistemology also features a number of competing accounts\nof justified belief, and the possibilities of their Bayesian\ncounterparts have been explored by Dunn (2015) and Tang (2016). For\nmore on the prospects of such Bayesian counterparts, see H\u00e1jek\nand Lin (2017).\n The Scientific Realism/Anti-Realism Debate:\nOne of the most classic debates in philosophy of science is that\nbetween scientific realism and anti-realism. The scientific realist\ncontends that science pursues theories are true literally or at least\napproximately, while the anti-realist denies that. An early\ncontribution to this debate is van Fraassen\u2019s (1989: part II)\nBayesian argument against inference to the best explanation (IBE),\nwhich is often used by scientific realists to defend their view. Some\nBayesians have joined the debate and try to save IBE instead; see\nsections 3.1 and 4 of the entry on\n abduction.\n Another influential defense of scientific realism proceeds with the\nso-called no-miracle argument. (This argument runs roughly as\nfollows: scientific realism is correct because it is the only\nphilosophical view that does not render the success of science a\nmiracle.) Howson (2000: ch. 3) and Magnus & Callender (2004)\nmaintain that the no-miracle argument commits a fallacy that can be\nmade salient from a Bayesian perspective. In reply, Sprenger &\nHartmann (2019: ch. 5) contend that Bayesian epistemology makes\npossible a better version of the no-miracle argument for scientific\nrealism. An anti-realist view is instrumentalism, which says that\nscience only need to pursue theories that are useful for making\nobservable predictions. Vassend (forthcoming) argues that\nconditionalization can be generalized in a way that caters to both the\nscientific realist and the instrumentalist\u2014regardless of whether\nevidence should be utilized in science to help us pursue truth or\nusefulness.\n Frequentist Concerns: Frequentists about\nstatistical inference design inference procedures for the purposes of,\nsay, testing a working hypothesis, identifying the truth among a set\nof competing hypotheses, or producing accurate estimates of certain\nquantities. And they want to design procedures that infer\nreliably\u2014with a low objective, physical chance of\nmaking errors. Those concerns have been incorporated into Bayesian\nstatistics, leading to the Bayesian counterparts of some frequentist\naccounts. In fact, those results have already appeared in standard\ntextbooks on Bayesian statistics, such as the influential one by\nGelman et al. (2014: sec. 4.4 and ch. 6). The line between frequentist\nand Bayesian statistics is blurring.\n\n\nSo, as can be seen from the many examples in I\u2013IV, Bayesians\nhave been assimilating ideas and concerns from the epistemological\ntradition of all-or-nothing beliefs. In fact, there have also been\nattempts to develop a joint epistemology\u2014an epistemology for\nagents who have both credences and all-or-nothing beliefs at the same\ntime; for details, see\n section 4.2 of the entry on formal representations of belief.\n\nIt is debatable which, if any, of the above topics can be adequately\naddressed in Bayesian epistemology. But Bayesians have been expanding\ntheir territory and their momentum will surely continue.\n",
