    "main_text": "\n\n\nMuch ordinary discourse about political and moral matters invokes the\nlanguage of needs. In such contexts claims about need are often\nthought to carry significant weight. By contrast, the role that needs\nshould play in normative reasoning is contested among philosophers. In\nthis article we discuss several core issues concerning needs in\ncontemporary moral and political philosophy. We begin by discussing\nthe normativity of needs and some of the disputes concerning the\nsignificance of needs claims.\n\n\nWe then canvass some reasons to be skeptical about needs and their\nability to do any useful work in moral and political philosophy.\nThese include skepticism about the objectivity of needs and therefore\nconcerns about whether needs claims can ground relevant obligations.\nSome also maintain that distribution according to need is undesirable,\nfor instance because it is essentially paternalistic, or because it\ncan result in being confronted with an overly burdensome and possibly\nendless series of demands. In response to such potential problems we\ndiscuss widely used strategies for disarming the main forms of\nskepticism and evaluate their success. \n\n\nOn the face of it, human beings can claim to have a wide variety of\nneeds. Which needs warrant normative attention? We discuss some\ninfluential recent accounts of the needs that matter morally, along\nwith the arguments offered for why those needs are special. Here we\ndiscuss influential work by Harry Frankfurt, David Braybrooke, David\nWiggins, David Miller, Len Doyal, and Ian Gough. While there are\nseveral common elements to these accounts, there are also important\ndifferences.\n\n\nWe then discuss needs in recent theories of distributive\njustice. Given the role needs seem to play in popular discourse about\nsocial justice it may seem odd that needs have largely been ignored by\ncontemporary theorists concerned with distributive justice. But by\nmeans of a wide trawl through the dominant theories, we show that this\nis indeed the case. We offer some explanations for this apparently odd\nphenomenon.\n\n\nMarx is well known for maintaining that a communist society would\naspire to distribute resources according to the principle \u201cfrom\neach according to his ability, to each according to his needs\u201d\n(Marx 1977, 569). What would distribution according to need entail?\nWe outline several possibilities, showing strengths and weaknesses\nwith each interpretation. However, as we highlight, there is no\nuniquely defensible or best way of understanding what the principle of\ndistribution according to need requires in all cases.\n\n\nA needs-based approach played an important role in global public\npolicy, especially concerning addressing poverty and human\ndevelopment, in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, the capabilities\napproach replaced it in the late 1980s. Policy-makers appeared to lose\nconfidence in a needs-based approach and capabilities were considered\nby many of the most influential decision-makers to offer a more\nsophisticated conceptual framework. We review some of the arguments on\nboth sides of this debate, discussing their strengths and\nweaknesses.\n\n\nIn our final section we identify some ways in which concern with needs\nextends to several contemporary debates, such as those concerning the\nscope and content of justice. What constraints do the needs of others\nwho are not proximate (either geographically or temporally) place on\nfair distributions within states, for instance? We note where more\nextended treatment of these concerns occurs in several other articles\nin this encyclopedia.\n",
