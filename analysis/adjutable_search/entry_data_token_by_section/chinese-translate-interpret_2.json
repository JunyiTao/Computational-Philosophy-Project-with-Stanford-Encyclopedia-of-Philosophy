    "main_text": "The Classical Chinese Language: What, How, and Why Does It Convey What It Conveys? || On the Semantics of Chinese Characters\n1.3 On the Semantics of Chinese Characters\nAs we have seen, a few phonetic and a number of syntactic features\nof Classical Chinese, singly or severally, can contribute to\ngenerating a host of possible interpretations of any given passage(s)\nin a text, by allowing for multiply grammatical readings of them. In\nmany if not most of these cases more than one of the readings will be\nconsistent with the context, and in keeping with the principle of\nlogical charity when that principle is applicable. At times semantic\nconcerns can reduce the number of interpretive possibilities of a\nsentence or section, but unfortunately at other times the semantic\ncontent of the characters can increase them. This is a major\nreason why the Daodejing, to take a famous example, is\nimpenetrable to a few, enigmatic to many more, and highly allusive for\neveryone, and has been the subject of well over 150 translations of it\nin English alone, as noted earlier.\nThe opening line of Chapter I reads:\n \u9053 \u53ef \u9053 \u975e \u5e38\n\u9053\nDao ke dao fei chang dao.\n\n\n\u9053(in first,\nthird, and sixth positions here) means \u201cpath\u201d,\n\u201cway\u201d, \u201cthe way\u201d, \u201cto\nfollow\u201d, \u201cto go down a path\u201d. It also means\n\u201cto speak\u201d, \u201cdoctrines\u201d.\n\u53effunctions like\nEnglish modal \u201ccan\u201d.\n\u975ea sign of\nnegation; usually in the sense of \u201cnot the same\nas\u201d.\n\u5e38\u201cunvarying\u201d, \u201cconstant\u201d,\n\u201cenduring\u201d, \u201cunchanging\u201d.\n\nLiterally, then, we have something like \u201cdao\ncan dao not the same as unchanging dao\u201d.\nHere are six translations of this passage, all by reputable\nscholars.\n\n1.\nThe Way that can be told of is not an Unvarying\n    Way. (Waley n.d.: 141)\n2.\nThe way that can be spoken of is not the\n    constant way. (Lau 1963: 57).\n3.\nThe Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring\n    and unchanging Tao. (Legge 1959: 95)\n4.\nA Way that can be followed is not a constant\n    Way. (Ivanhoe 2002: 1)\n5.\nWay-making (dao) that can be put into\n    words is not really way-making. (Ames and Hall 2003:\n    77)\n6.\nAs to a Dao\u2014 If it can be specified\n    as a Dao It is not a permanent Dao. (Moeller 2007:\n    3)\n\nA bit of syntax first. Translations 1\u20134 all take the first\nand third occurrences of dao as nouns, the second as a\nverb. 5 makes verbs of all three, and 6 pretty much makes nouns of all\nthree. Nothing in the original strictly prohibits any of these; the\nultimate determinant of each translation almost surely had more to do\nwith the translator\u2019s interpretation of the text overall than\nwith its language.\nTurning to semantics, while all six translations have family\nresemblances to one another, philosophically the ontological claims\nmade in 1, 2, 4 and 6 are different from 3 and 5 with respect to the\nnature of the dao: in the former, if you can talk\nabout it, it isn\u2019t a (or the) unchanging dao; whereas\nin 3 and 5 the claim is that if you can walk (tread, follow)\nthe (or a) dao it isn\u2019t a (or the)\nunchanging dao. The articles in parentheses are also of\nontological import here:\n\u201ca\u201d dao is surely different from\n\u201cthe\u201d dao (there are no articles in\nChinese). Four of the translators had\n\u201cway\u201d/\u201ctao\u201d/\u201cdao\u201d grow capital\nletters, presumably to tell the reader something more than would be\nconveyed by using lower case (impossible in the original, of course).\nBut what exactly is it that is being conveyed?\nDao is by no means the only character with such different\nmeanings, although it is a special case. De, \u5fb7, has\nthe same multiplicity of them: \u201cvirtue\u201d,\n\u201cpower\u201d, \u201cexcellence\u201d, \u201cforce\u201d,\n\u201cconduct\u201d, \u201ccharisma\u201d. And so do many other\ngraphs of philosophical import. At the same time, many other graphs do\nnot have meanings different enough to cause philosophical problems of\ninterpretation.  Fa, \u6cd5, entries, for example, include\n\u201claw\u201d, \u201cregulation\u201d, \u201cmethod\u201d,\n\u201cpattern\u201d, where the general meaning of fa is\nfairly clear, or at least clear enough that any of the English terms\ncould normally be used to translate it without undue loss of meaning,\nor philosophical distortion.\nReturning now to the first line of the Daodejing, all six\nof the translators can proffer good reasons for choosing the English\nwords they used; their translations are consistent with Chinese syntax\nand semantics, but without context it is impossible to ascertain which\nmeaning the author of the sentence intended; indeed, we don\u2019t\nknow which of the several contributors to the text wrote the first\nline. The principle of logical charity is no help in this\ncase\u2014assume that the author(s) do not contradict\nthemselves\u2014because the Daodejing is notorious for being\nparadoxical: Chapter 56 begins: \u201cThose who know do not speak;\nThose who speak do not know\u201d, which is clearly intentional, and\nrhetorically efficacious despite its logical invitation to a charge\nof tu quoque. It thus makes no sense at all to ask which of\nthe six translations is the correct one, or even\nthe best one, except on the basis of an interpretation of the\ntext as a whole, all six of which currently on offer herein contest\nthe others. Indeed there is a high probability that the author of the\nline intended the ambiguity attendant on the construal\nof the second dao, in which case it becomes impossible to\ngive the correct translation in English. One long-time student of\nearly Daoism summed up the matter succinctly: \u201cReading [it] is\nan act of creation\u201d (Welch 1971:\n11). We will return to\nthe theme of ambiguity\u2014both syntactic and\nsemantic\u2014in \u00a74.2.\nIf the student new to the study of Chinese philosophy takes away\none idea from this brief summarization of a complex set of\ninterconnected linguistic issues focusing on texts, perhaps the most\nfruitful one would be that the writing of philosophy in classical\nChinese affects the philosophy written in a number of ways that call\ninto question the unquestioned assumption that writing is simply\ntranscribed speech, relatively unaffected by its means of\ntransmission. This is a dubious idea for any language, but especially\nsuspect with classical Chinese. Consider the following from Michael\nNylan, writing about the compositions of the Han Dynasty\nscholar-official and author Yang Xiong (53 BCE\u201318 CE):\n\nPhrases replete with reduplicatives, verbal alliteration and\n  rhymes would have delighted the tongue and the ears. The eye would\n  have been attracted by the dance of the black ink graphic patterns\n  on the silk scroll or bamboo bundle, especially where there was\n  visual alliteration. (Nylan 2011: 63)\n\nA second useful idea to retain would be that relatively few issues\nof translation of early Chinese texts can be resolved once for all on\nlinguistic grounds alone. Even judging better from worse readings\nalmost always hinges more on the interpretation given to the text by\nthe interpreter and/or translator, and the purpose(s) for which the\ntranslation was done, topics to which we will now turn. We will begin\nwith some issues that are of import both in contemporary Western\nphilosophy and for the student of Chinese thought, following which we\nwill concentrate directly on the latter.\n",
