    "main_text": "Philosophizing With Others?\n4. Philosophizing With Others?\n\nPhilosophy for Children encourages children to think for\nthemselves at the same time that it encourages them to think\nwith others. However, philosophy is often viewed as more a\nmatter of solitary reflection, perhaps involving exchanges between a\nfew other solitary thinkers\u2014something to which the\n\u201cmasses\u201d are neither privy nor attracted. Perhaps many\nwould claim that this is philosophy at its best. Even if this were so\n(a controversial view), it would not undermine arguments for including\nphilosophy in the K-12 curricula. However esoteric physics and\nmathematics at their best may be, the schools nevertheless recognize\nthe importance of making these subjects available in some form to all\nstudents. Similarly, Philosophy for Children advocates can counter\nthat there should be a place for all students\u2014whether labelled\n\u201cgifted and talented,\u201d \u201cunderachieving,\u201d or\n\u201cordinary\u201d\u2014pursuing philosophical questions\ntogether.\n\nFor this to work, it must be possible for children in the classroom to\nengage in sustained philosophical discussion with others. As already\nnoted, Gareth Matthew\u2019s writings provide ample evidence that\nchildren are capable of having interesting, if not profound,\nphilosophical thoughts. Less obvious, however, is children\u2019s\nability to sustain and develop this with others. Anecdotes of young\nchildren spontaneously sharing a philosophical thought with an\nobservant adult are not sufficient. Matthews\u2019 Dialogues With\nChildren provides good evidence that children can go well beyond\nthis. Other examples of substantial philosophical conversations of\nchildren found in Lone (2012, 2021), McCall (2009), Pritchard (1996,\n2022), Shapiro (2012), and Wartenberg (2009, 2013), among many others,\nshould leave little doubt that children have this ability.\n",
