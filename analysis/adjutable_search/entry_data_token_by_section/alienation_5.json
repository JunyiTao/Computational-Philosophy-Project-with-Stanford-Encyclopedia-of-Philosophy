    "main_text": "Adjacent Concepts || Objectification\n2.3 Objectification\n\nThe second of these adjacent ideas is objectification. The\nconcept in question is not the idea of objectification\u2014familiar\nfrom certain feminist and Kantian traditions\u2014which concerns the\nmoral impropriety of systematically treating a human being as if she\nwere an object, thing, or commodity (Nussbaum 1995). That is a\ndistinct and important phenomenon, but it is not the one that is\nrelevant here. In the present context, objectification refers rather\nto the role of productive activity in mediating the evolving\nrelationship between humankind and the natural world. This association\nis most familiar from certain Hegelian and Marxist traditions, with\nMarx often using the German term\n\u2018Vergegenst\u00e4ndlichung\u2019 to capture what is\nhere called \u2018objectification\u2019 (e.g., 1975: 272).\n\nHumankind is seen as being part of, and dependent upon, the natural\nworld. However, nature is initially somewhat stingy with its\nblessings; as a result, human beings confront the natural world from\nan original position of scarcity, struggling through productive\nactivity of various kinds to change the material form of\nnature\u2014typically through making things\u2014in ways that make\nit better reflect and satisfy their own needs and interests. In that\nevolving process, both the natural world and humankind come to be\ntransformed. Through this collective shaping of their material\nsurroundings, and their increasing productivity, the natural world is\nmade to be, and seem, less \u2018other\u2019, and human beings\nthereby come to objectify themselves, to express their essential\npowers in concrete form. These world transforming productive\nactivities, we might say, embody the progressive self-realisation of\nhumankind.\n\nOn this account, all productive activity would seem to involve\nobjectification. However, Marx insists that not all productive\nactivity involves alienation. Moreover, some other forms of\nalienation\u2014unrelated to productive activity\u2014have no\nobvious connection with objectification.\n\nMarx maintains that productive activity might or might not take an\nalienated form. For instance, productive activity in capitalist\nsocieties is typically said to take an alienated form; whereas\nproductive activity in communist societies is typically predicted to\ntake an unalienated or meaningful form. Schematically, we might\nportray alienated labour (characteristic of capitalist\nsociety) as: being forced; not involving self-realisation (not\ndeveloping and deploying essential human powers); not intended to\nsatisfy the needs of others; and not appropriately appreciated by\nthose others. And, schematically, we might portray unalienated or\nmeaningful work (characteristic of communist society) as:\nbeing freely chosen; involving self-realisation (the development and\ndeployment of essential human powers); being intended to satisfy the\nneeds of others; and being appropriately appreciated by those\nothers (Kandiyali 2020). Productive activity mediates the\nrelationship between humankind and the natural world in both of these\nsocieties, but alienation is found only in the former (capitalist)\ncase.\n\nFor an example of a view which might be said to equate objectification\nwith alienation, consider what is sometimes called the\n\u2018Christian\u2019 view of work. On this account, work is seen as\na necessary evil, an unpleasant activity unfortunately required for\nour survival. It owes its name to Christianity\u2019s embrace of the\nclaim that alienated work is part of the human condition: at least\nsince the Fall, human beings are required to work by the sweat of\ntheir brows (see Genesis 31:9). On Marx\u2019s account, or something\nlike it, one might characterise this Christian view as mistakenly\nequating objectification and alienation, confusing productive activity\nas such with its stunted and inhuman forms. Indeed, one might go\nfurther and suggest that this kind of confusion reflects the alienated\nsocial condition of humankind, embodying an emblematic failure to\nunderstand that material production is a central realm in which human\nbeings can express, in free and creative ways, the kind of creatures\nthat they are.\n\nIn addition, according to the basic idea defended here, equating\nalienation and objectification fails to appreciate that certain forms\nof alienation might have nothing at all to do with productive\nactivity. Their mutual hostility and undisguised contempt confirm that\nGillian and her sister Hanna are alienated from each other, but there\nseems little reason to assume that their estrangement is necessarily\nrelated to the world of work or their respective place in it. The\nsisters\u2019 engagement in productive activity and the forms that it\ntakes, might well have nothing to do with the problematic separation\nhere. Imagine that the latter arose from a combination of sibling\nrivalry, stubbornness, and a chance misunderstanding at a time of\nfamily crisis involving the death of a parent. This possibility gives\nus another reason not to equate alienation and objectification.\n\nIn short, neither fetishism, nor objectification, are best construed as identical with alienation. Rather than being synonymous, these concepts only partially overlap. Fetishism can be understood as picking out only a subset\u2014on some accounts perhaps\na large subset\u2014of cases of alienation. And there are forms of\nobjectification which do not involve alienation (the meaningful work\nin communist societies, for instance), as well as forms of\nalienation\u2014outside of productive activity\u2014with no obvious\nconnection to objectification.\n",
