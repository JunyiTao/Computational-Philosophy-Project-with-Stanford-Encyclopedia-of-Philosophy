    "main_text": "The Ingredients of Medieval Philosophy || Text and Commentary Traditions\n1.1 Text and Commentary Traditions\n\nIn the Middle Ages, as in other periods, philosophy took many written\nforms, from encyclopaedias and compendia to monographs and short\nessays, from poetic, allegorical, and novelistic presentations to\ntexts based directly on school and university practice (such as\nquodlibets) (see entry on\n Literary Forms of Medieval Philosophy).\n But there is one literary form that was used centrally in all the\nfour traditions, but has lost its importance in modern times: the\ncommentary. Much of the best medieval philosophy was done in\ncommentaries, many of which were far from mere aids to understanding\nthe text concerned. Whereas philosophers now, at least in the analytic\ntradition, think of their subject as made up of problems,\nwhich are tackled using what others have said and are saying as aids,\nmedieval philosophizing was frequently based on (often, but not\nalways, old and venerated) texts. But, although the aim was\nusually to interpret them, the practice of interpretation frequently\nled to new thinking, related only tangentially to the text under\ndiscussion.\n\nThe central texts for commentary in the Greek, Latin, Jewish branches,\nand among Arabic philosophers up to the twelfth century were\nAristotle\u2019s. The Byzantine philosophers used them in the\noriginal, Latin and Arabic philosophers in translation, and the\nHebrew-writing Jewish philosophers usually indirectly, via epitomes\nand paraphrase commentaries translated from Arabic. No other ancient\nphilosopher\u2019s texts received anything remotely near to this\nlevel of attention, although various works of Boethius received\nmultiple commentaries in the Latin\n tradition;[3]\n commentary on Plato was\n sporadic.[4]\n But the many commentaries on the Bible and on the Quran sometimes\nincluded substantial philosophical discussions.\n\nIn the Latin tradition, direct commentary on Aristotle remained\ncentral to most higher education until late in the seventeenth century\n (\u00a75.2),\n but Arabic authors stopped commenting on his works directly after the\ntwelfth century, and earlier outside Spain. Instead, they began to\ncomment on Avicenna\u2019s rethinking of Aristotle\n (\u00a72.3,\n \u00a72.10). Commentaries on his work continued to be written, but\nadded to them were, successively, commentaries on later writers who\nhad themselves rethought and rewritten Avicenna\u2019s expositions.\nIslamic scholars saw commentary as a way of thinking not just on the\nbasis of revered old texts, but on that of the best recent\n textbooks.[5]\n Although this constant replacement of texts to be commented was\nforeign to the Latin tradition, three medieval Latin texts were\nthemselves vehicles for many commentaries. The two set texts in the\nuniversity theology faculties\n (\u00a72.7)\n were the Bible and a work written circa 1155 by Peter the Lombard,\nthe Sentences, where he set out systematically all the\nproblematic questions in theology and proposed solutions, quoting\nextensively from Augustine (Evans and Rosemann 2002\u201314). Much of\nthe best theological and philosophical work in the period from\n1250\u20131550 was done in commentaries on the Sentences,\nbut usually the Lombard\u2019s text was just the springboard for\ndebate. Peter of Spain\u2019s popular logical\n Treatise\u00a0(\u00a74.2)\n received commentaries, as did the greatest philosophical poem of the\nperiod, Dante\u2019s Commedia Divina\n (\u00a72.8).[6]\n\nThe types of commentaries were legion. They included: simple, literal\nglosses, designed to help beginners (e.g., Latin twelfth-century\nliteral logic commentaries); sophisticated literal commentaries,\nexplaining an author\u2019s argument at a high level (e.g.,\nAquinas\u2019s Aristotle commentaries); line by line commentary, with\nlong discursive discussions and excursuses (e.g., Boethius and Abelard\non Aristotelian logic; Averroes\u2019s \u201cGreat\u201d\ncommentaries); paraphrase-type abbreviations and rewritings of the\noriginal texts, often with added material and ideas and a new emphasis\n(e.g., Averroes\u2019s epitomes and \u201cMiddle\u201d\ncommentaries); discursive rethinkings of a whole area of a past\nauthor\u2019s work (e.g., Avicenna\u2019s and Albert the\nGreat\u2019s commentaries on Aristotle); allegorical readings of a\ntext (e.g., some Biblical commentary, both Christian and Jewish,\nearlier medieval commentaries on Plato\u2019s Timaeus and\nBook III, metrum 9 of Boethius\u2019s Consolation, which\nepitomizes it, Dante commentaries). A distinctive form of commentary\nused in the Latin universities was the Question Commentary, where a\nbook would be commented on by posing questions related to the content\nof its sections or even, more vaguely, its larger divisions\n(Baz\u00e1n, Wippel, Fransen, & Jacquart 1985), with the text\noften a mere peg on which to fit the commentator's own agenda for\nphilosophical discussion.\n",
