In this section we briefly examine some of these\nobjections.\n5.5.1 Self-Defeat\n\n\nA prominent objection to the Equal Weight View and other views that\nprescribe doxastic conciliation is that such views are self-defeating.\nFor expressions of this objection, see Elga 2010, Frances 2010,\nO\u2019Connor 1999, Plantinga 2000a and 2000b, Taliaferro 2009,\nWeatherson 2014, and Weintraub 2013. For responses, see Bogardus 2009,\nChristensen 2009, Elga 2010, Graves 2013, Kornblith 2013, Littlejohn\n2013, Matheson 2015b, and Pittard 2015. In brief, there is disagreement\nabout the epistemic significance of disagreement itself, so any view\nthat calls for conciliation upon the discovery of disagreement can have\nit that it calls for its own rejection. For instance, a defender of the\nEqual Weight View could become aware of enough individuals that are\nsuitably epistemically well-positioned on the epistemology of\ndisagreement that nevertheless deny that the Equal Weight View is\ncorrect. Following the prescriptions of the Equal Weight View would\nrequire this defender to abandon the view, and perhaps even accept a\ncompetitor account. For these reasons, Plantinga (2000a) has claimed\nthat such views are, \u2018self-referentially inconsistent\u2019\n(522) and Elga (2010) has claimed that such views are\n\u2018incoherent\u2019 and \u2018self-undermining\u2019 (179). Such\na worry seems to apply to the Equal Weight View, the Justificationist\nView, and the Total Evidence View. Since all three views prescribe\nconciliation in at least some cases, they are all (at least in\nprinciple) subject to such a result.\n\n\nDefenders of these conciliatory views have responded in a number of\nways. First, some emphasize the way in which these views are\nself-defeating is not a way that shows these views to be false, or\nincapable of being true. \u2018No true sentences have\nmore than 5 words\u2019 may also be said to be self-defeating, but\nthis is a different kind of defeat. At its worst, the consequences here\nfor conciliatory views is that given certain contingent circumstances\nthey cannot be reasonably believed, but such an inability to be\nreasonably believed does not demonstrate their falsity. Further, a\nskeptical attitude toward the epistemic significance of disagreement\nseems to fit the spirit of these views quite well (more on this\nbelow).\n\n\nAnother way such a consequence has been downplayed is by comparing\nit to other principles that share the same result. Along these lines,\nChristensen gives the following:\n\nMinimal Humility.  If I have thought casually about \\(P\\) for\n10 minutes, and have decided it is correct, and then find out that\n1000 people, most of them much smarter and more familiar with the\nrelevant evidence and arguments than I, have thought long and hard\nabout \\(P\\), and have independently but unanimously decided that \\(P\\)\nis false, I am not justified in believing \\(P\\).  In fact, I am\njustified in disbelieving \\(P\\). (2009, 763.)\n\n\nThe principle of Minimal Humility is quite plausible, yet there are\ncontingent circumstances under which it calls for its own rejection\ntoo. If such a consequence is untenable, then it would call for the\nrejection of principles beyond those endorsed by the Equal Weight View,\nthe Justificationist View, and the Total Evidence View.\n\n\nA final response argues that these principles about disagreement are\nthemselves exempt from their conciliatory prescriptions. So, correctly\nunderstood, these principles call for conciliation in ordinary\ndisagreements, but prescribe remaining steadfast in disagreements about\ndisagreements. So on this view, the true principles are not\nself-defeating. Several philosophers have endorsed such a response to\nthe self-defeat worry. Bogardus (2009) argues that we can \u2018just\nsee\u2019 that conciliatory principles are true and this prevents them\nfrom being self-undermining. Elga (2010) argues that conciliatory\nviews, properly understood, are self-exempting since fundamental\nprinciples must be dogmatic about their own correctness. Pittard (2015)\nargues that remaining resolute in conciliationism is no more\nnon-deferential than being conciliatory about conciliationism. The\nreasoning here is that to conciliate about one\u2019s conciliatory\nprinciples would be deferential about one\u2019s belief or credence,\nbut steadfast about one\u2019s reasoning. So, once we appreciate the\ndistinct levels of belief/credence and reasoning, either response to a\ndisagreement about the significance of disagreement will require being\nsteadfast at one level. This, argues Pittard, makes remaining steadfast\nabout conciliationism unproblematic.\n\n\nWhile such responses would avoid the self-defeat charge, some see it\nguilty of arbitrariness (see Pittard 2015, Blessenohl 2015).\n5.5.2 Formal issues\n\n\nA further set of issues regarding the Equal Weight View come from\nconsiderations within formal epistemology. Fitelson and Jelhe (2009)\nargue that there are difficulties in making precise the Equal Weight\nView along Bayesian lines. In particular, they argue that the most\nintuitive understandings of the Equal Weight View have untenable\nconsequences. Gardiner (2014) and Wilson (2010) each raise an\nobjection that Equal Weight View (at least as typically understood)\nviolates the principle of commutativity of evidence. If we imagine an\nindividual encountering a number of disagreeing peers sequentially,\nthen which doxastic attitude is reasonable for the peer will depend\nupon the order at which the peers are confronted. However, the\nprinciple of commutativity of evidence claims that the order of\nevidential acquisition should not make such a\ndifference. Lasonen-Arnio (2013) sets up a trilemma for the Equal\nWeight View arguing that either (i) it violates intuitively correct\nupdates, (ii) it places implausible restrictions on priors, or (iii)\nit is non-substantive.\n5.5.3 Actual Disagreement and Possible disagreement\n\n\nAnother issue concerns which disagreements are of epistemic\nsignificance. While actual peer disagreement is rare, if not\nnon-existent (see below), merely possible peer disagreement is\neverywhere. For any belief you have, it is possible that an epistemic\npeer of yours disagrees. Since we are fallible epistemic agents,\npossible peer disagreement is inevitable. One challenge is to\ndistinguish the epistemic significance of actual peer disagreement\nfrom the significance of merely possible peer disagreement. Kelly\n(2005) first raises this challenge. After all, whether this possible\ndisagreeing peer actually exists is a contingent and fragile matter,\nso to only care about it may be to exhibit an \u2018actual world\nchauvinism\u2019. (This term comes from Carey 2011.)\n\n\nChristensen (2007) responds to this challenge by noting that while\nmerely possible disagreement only shows that we are fallible, actual\ndisagreement demonstrates that someone has in fact made a mistake.\nSince we are already aware that we are fallible epistemic agents,\nthinking about possible peer disagreements does not add any information\nthat calls for (further) doxastic change. In contrast, discovering an\nactual peer disagreement gives us information that we lacked. In a case\nof peer disagreement, one of the parties has made a mistake. While the\npossibility of error does not demand belief revision, an increase in\nthe probability of having made an error does.\n\n\nA further question is whether actual peer disagreements are the only\npeer disagreements with epistemic significance. For instance, suppose\nthat you have created an argument that you find sound in the solitude\nof your office. When thinking about what your (peer) colleague would\nthink, suppose that you reasonably conclude that she would disagree\nabout the merits of your argument. If such a conclusion is reasonable\nfor you, then it seems that this fact should have some epistemic\nconsequences for you despite the fact that there is not (at least as of\nyet) any actual disagreement. Arguably, such a merely possible\ndisagreement even has the same epistemic significance as an actual\ndisagreement (see Carey & Matheson 2013). Similarly, if an evil\ntyrant believes \\(P\\) and then chooses to eliminate all disagreeing peers\nwho believe not-\\(P\\), he would not thereby become justified in his\npreviously contentious belief (Kelly 2005). A challenge is to pick out\nwhich merely possible disagreements are epistemically significant,\nsince at the risk of global skepticism, clearly not all are (Barnett\nand Li 2017). Issues surrounding counterfactual disagreement are also\nexamined in Ballantyne 2013b, Bogardus 2016, and Morgensen 2016.\n5.5.4 Irrelevance of Peer Disagreement\n\n\nA final issue concerns peer disagreement itself. As some have noted,\nepistemic peers are extremely rare, if not non-existent (Frances 2010,\n2014; King 2011; Matheson 2014). After all, what are the odds\nthat someone else is in precisely as good of an epistemic position as\nyou on some matter\u2014and even she was, would you know it? As we\nhave seen, there are a number of disagreement factors, and the odds\nthat they end in a tie between any two individuals at any given time is\nquite unlikely. The paucity of peers may be taken to show that the\ndebate of the epistemic significance of peer disagreement is a futile\nexercise in extreme hypotheticals. After all, if you have no epistemic\npeers that disagree with you, doesn\u2019t the epistemic threat from\ndisagreement dissolve? Further, there may seem to have been a deceptive\nshift in the debate. Much of the puzzle of disagreement is motivated by\nmessy real world cases of disagreement, but the vast majority of the\nliterature is focused on idealized cases of disagreement that rarely,\nif ever, occur.\n\n\nThere are several reasons to think about the significance of peer\ndisagreement beyond its intrinsic appeal. First, considering the\nidealized cases of peer disagreement helps to isolate the epistemic\nsignificance of the disagreement itself. By controlling for other\nepistemic factors, cases of peer disagreement help us focus on what\nepistemic effects discovered disagreement has. While in non-idealized\ncases this is but one factor in determining what to believe, the debate\nabout peer disagreements attempts to help us better understand this one\nfactor. Second, while peers may be quite rare, as we have noted above,\nit is often not clear which party is in the better epistemic position.\nFor instance, while it is quite rare for two individuals to be the\nexact same weight, it can often be unclear which individual weighs\nmore. These unknown cases may have the same epistemic significance as\npeer cases. If what is needed is a positive reason to privilege\none\u2019s own view, as opposed to positive reasons to think that the\nother is a peer, then unknown cases should be treated like peer\ncases.\n\n\nIn what follows we turn to examining the epistemic significance of\ndisagreement outside of these idealized cases of peer disagreement.\n",
