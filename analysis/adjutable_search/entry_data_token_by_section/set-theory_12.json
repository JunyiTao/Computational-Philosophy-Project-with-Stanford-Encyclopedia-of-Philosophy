    "main_text": "The set theory of the continuum || The Continuum Hypothesis\n6.3 The Continuum Hypothesis\n\nThe Continuum Hypothesis (CH), formulated by Cantor in 1878, asserts\nthat every infinite set of real numbers has cardinality either\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) or the same cardinality as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Thus, the CH\nis equivalent to \\(2^{\\aleph_0}=\\aleph_1\\).\n\nCantor proved in 1883 that closed sets of real numbers have the\nperfect set property, from which it follows that every uncountable\nclosed set of real numbers has the same cardinality as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nThus, the CH holds for closed sets. More than thirty years later,\nPavel Aleksandrov extended the result to all Borel sets, and then\nMikhail Suslin to all analytic sets. Thus, all analytic sets satisfy\nthe CH. However, the efforts to prove that co-analytic sets satisfy\nthe CH would not succeed, as this is not provable in ZFC.\n\nIn 1938 G\u00f6del proved the consistency of the CH with ZFC. Assuming\nthat ZF is consistent, he built a model of ZFC, known as the\nconstructible universe, in which the CH holds. Thus, the\nproof shows that if ZF is consistent, then so is ZF together with the\nAC and the CH. Hence, assuming ZF is consistent, the AC cannot be\ndisproved in ZF and the CH cannot be disproved in ZFC.\n\nSee the entry on the\n continuum hypothesis\n for the current status of the problem.\n",
