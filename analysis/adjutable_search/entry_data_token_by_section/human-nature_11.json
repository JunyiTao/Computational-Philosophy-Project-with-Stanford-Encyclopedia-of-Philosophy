    "main_text": "Explanatory Human Properties || Genetically Based Psychological Adaptations?\n4.1 Genetically Based Psychological Adaptations?\n\nNevertheless, humans do generally develop a specific set of\nphysiological features, such as two lungs, one stomach, one pancreas\nand two eyes. Moreover, having such a bodily architecture is,\naccording to the evidence from genetics, to a significant extent the\nresult of developmental programmes that ground in gene regulatory\nnetworks (GRNs). These are stretches of non-coding DNA that regulate\ngene transcription. GRNs are modular, more or less strongly entrenched\nstructures. The most highly conserved of these tend to be the\nphylogenetically most archaic (Carroll 2000; Walsh 2006: 436ff.;\nWillmore 2012: 227ff.). The GRNs responsible for basic physiological\nfeatures may be taken, in a fairly innocuous sense, to belong to an\nevolved human nature.\n\nImportantly, purely morphological features have generally not been the\nexplananda of accounts that have gone under the rubric \u201chuman\nnature\u201d. What has frequently motivated explanatory accounts thus\nlabelled is the search for underlying structures responsible for\ngenerally shared psychological features. \u201cEvolutionary\nPsychologists\u201d have built a research programme around the claim\nthat humans share a psychological architecture that parallels that of\ntheir physiology. This, they believe, consists of a structured set of\npsychological \u201corgans\u201d or modules (Tooby & Cosmides\n1990: 29f.; 1992: 38, 113). This architecture is, they claim, in turn\nthe product of developmental programmes inscribed in humans\u2019 DNA\n(1992: 45). Such generally distributed developmental programmes they\nlabel \u201chuman nature\u201d (1990: 23).\n\nThis conception raises the question of how analogous the\ncharacteristic physical and psychological \u201carchitectures\u201d\nare. For one thing, the physical properties that tend to appear in\nsuch lists are far more coarse-grained than the candidates for shared\npsychological properties (D. Wilson 1994: 224ff.): the claim is not\njust that humans tend to have perceptual, desiderative, doxastic and\nemotional capacities, but that the mental states that realise these\ncapacities tend to have contents of specific types. Perhaps an\narchitecture of the former kind\u2014of a formal psychology\u2014is\na plausible, if relatively unexciting candidate for the mental side of\nwhat an evolved human nature should explain. Either way, any such\nconception needs to adduce criteria for the individuation of such\n\u201cmental organs\u201d (D. Wilson 1994: 233). Relatedly, if the\nmost strongly entrenched developmental programmes are the most\narchaic, it follows that, although these will be species-typical, they\nwill not be species-specific. Programmes for the development of body\nparts have been identified for higher taxa, rather than for\nspecies.\n\nA further issue that dogs any such attempts to explicate the\n\u201chuman\u201d dimension of human nature in terms of\ndevelopmental programmes inscribed in human DNA concerns Evolutionary\nPsychologists\u2019 assertion that the programmes are the same in\nevery specimen of the species. This assertion goes hand in hand with\nthe claim that what is explained by such programmes is a deep\npsychological structure that is common to almost all humans and\nunderlies the surface diversity of behavioural and psychological\nphenomena (Tooby & Cosmides 1990: 23f.). For Evolutionary\nPsychologists, the (near-)universality of both developmental\nprogrammes and deep psychological structure has an ultimate\nexplanation in evolutionary processes that mark their products as\nnatural in the sense of TP1. Both, they claim, are adaptations. These\nare features that were selected for because their possession in the\npast conferred a fitness advantage on their possessors. Evolutionary\nPsychologists conceive that advantage as conferred by the fulfilment\nof some specific function. They summarise selection for that function\nas \u201cdesign\u201d, which they take to have operated equally on\nall species specimens since the Pleistocene. This move reintroduces\nthe teleological idea of a fully developed form beyond mere\nstatistical normality (TP3).\n\nThis move has been extensively criticised. First, selection pressures\noperate at the level of groups and hence need not lead to the same\nstructures in all a group\u2019s members (D. Wilson 1994: 227ff.;\nGriffiths 2011: 325; Sterelny 2018: 120). Second, other evolutionary\nmechanisms than natural selection might be explanatorily decisive.\nGenetic drift or mutation and recombination might, for example, also\nconfer \u201cnaturalness\u201d in the sense of evolutionary genesis\n(Buller 2000: 436). Third, as we have every reason to assume that the\nevolution of human psychology is ongoing, evolutionary biology\nprovides little support for the claim that particular programmes and\nassociated traits evolved to fixity in the Pleistocene (Buller 2000:\n477ff.; Downes 2010).\n\nPerhaps, however, there might turn out to be gene control networks\nthat do generally structure certain features of the psychological\ndevelopment of contemporary humans (Walsh 2006: 440ff.). The quest for\nsuch GNRs can, then, count as the search for an explanatory nature of\ncontemporary humans, where the explanatory function thus sought is\ndivorced from any classificatory role.\n",
