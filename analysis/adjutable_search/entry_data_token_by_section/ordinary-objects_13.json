Let the ks be the\natoms that presently compose my kitchen table, K, and let us suppose\nthat there is some time, t, long before the table itself was made, at\nwhich the ks all existed.\n\n(CU1)\nIf universalism is true, then there is some object, F, that the ks\ncomposed at t.\n(CU2)\nIf the ks composed F at t, then F exists now.\n(CU3)\nIf F exists now, then F = K.\n(CU4)\nIf F = K, then K existed at t.\n(CU5)\nK did not exist at t.\n(CU6)\nSo, universalism is false.\n\n\nCU1 looks to be a consequence of universalism, given our assumption\nthat the ks all existed at t. The idea behind CU2 is that there would\nseem to be only two nonarbitrary accounts of the persistence\nconditions of the widely scattered fusion F: (i) that F exists for as\nlong as the ks are in precisely the arrangement that they enjoy at t\nor (ii) that F exists for as long as the ks exist. Option (i) imposes\nan implausibly severe constraint on the sorts of changes an object can\nsurvive, which leaves us with option (ii)\u2014from which it follows\nthat, since the ks exist now, so does F. The idea behind CU3 is that\nthere cannot be distinct objects which (like F and K) have exactly the\nsame parts and exactly the same location. CU4 is a straightforward\nconsequence of Leibniz\u2019s Law: F by hypothesis existed at t, so\nif F = K then K must also have existed at t. As for CU5, tables\nplausibly are essentially tables, in which case K could not have\nexisted before the table was made.\n\nHere are some options for resisting the argument (some mirroring\nresponses to the puzzles of material constitution). One can deny CU2\non the grounds that table is the \u201cdominant kind\u201d,\nand once K comes into existence, it takes F\u2019s place and F is\nannihilated. Constitutional pluralists can deny CU3 and affirm that F\n\u2260 K, perhaps granting that distinct objects can have exactly the\nsame parts and location, or insisting that F and K have different\n(e.g., temporal) parts. Or one can deny CU5, insisting that K is only\ncontingently a table and (like F) was once a scattered\n fusion.[71]\n\nNow for the coincidence argument against DAUP. Take the example of\nWoodrow and Woodrow-minus from\n \u00a72.8.\n At t1, Molly the cellulose molecule is a part of Woodrow\nand at t2 Molly is removed and destroyed. Let\nWoodrow1 be that (if anything) which \u2018Woodrow\u2019\npicks out at t1; Woodrow2, that (if anything)\nwhich \u2018Woodrow\u2019 picks out at t2; and mutatis\nmutandis for Woodrow-minus1 and Woodrow-minus2.\nHere is the argument:\n\n(CD1)\nIf DAUP is true, then Woodrow-minus1 exists.\n(CD2)\nIf Woodrow-minus1 exists, then\nWoodrow-minus2 exists.\n(CD3)\nIf Woodrow-minus2 exists, then\nWoodrow-minus2 = Woodrow2.\n(CD4)\nIf Woodrow-minus2 = Woodrow2, then\nWoodrow-minus1 = Woodrow1.\n(CD5)\nWoodrow-minus1 \u2260 Woodrow1.\n(CD6)\nSo, DAUP is false.\n\n\nCD1 looks trivial: DAUP guarantees that there is an arbitrary\nundetached part of Woodrow composed of all of its parts other than\nMolly. The idea behind CD2 is that Woodrow-minus doesn\u2019t undergo\nany change between t1 and t2 that could threaten\nits existence; all that happens is that it is separated from something\n(Molly) that was not even a part of it. CD3, like CU3, is motivated by\nthe intuition that objects with the same parts and same location must\nbe identical. CD4 is an application of the transitivity of identity:\nWoodrow-minus1 = Woodrow-minus2, so if\nWoodrow-minus2 = Woodrow2, then (by\ntransitivity) Woodrow-minus1 = Woodrow2; and\nsince Woodrow2 = Woodrow1, it follows (by\ntransitivity) that Woodrow-minus1 = Woodrow1.\nFinally, CD5 is a straightforward consequence of Leibniz\u2019s Law:\nWoodrow-minus1 and Woodrow1 have different parts\nand thus cannot be identical.\n\nAs with the argument against universalism, one can resist this\nargument by denying CD2 and insisting that once Molly is removed,\nWoodrow-minus is \u201cdominated\u201d by Woodrow and ceases to\nexist. Or one can deny CD3 and insist that Woodrow and Woodrow-minus\nare distinct at t2 despite having all the same material\nparts at t2. Or one can deny CD4 by insisting that Woodrow\nhas all of its parts essentially, in which case Woodrow1\n\u2260\n Woodrow2.[72]\n",
