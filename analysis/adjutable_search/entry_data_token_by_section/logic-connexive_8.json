In a similar vein, Lewis\u2019 student E. Nelson\ncame up with an axiom system from which Aristotle\u2019s and\nBoethius\u2019 theses can be derived. The system is called\nNL in Mares and Paoli 2019, where its axioms and\ninference rules are presented as follows (we here use schematic\nletters for arbitrary formulas instead of propositional variables and\na different symbol for negation):\n\n\n\n1.1\nA \u2192 A \n\n1.2\n(A|B) \u2192 (B|A)\n\n\n1.3\nA \u2192 ~~A \n\n1.4\n(A \u2192 B) \u2192 (A \u25e6\nB) \n\n1.5\n(A \u2260 B \u2260 C) \u2192 (((A \u2192\nB ) \u2227 (B \u2192 C )) \u2192 (A\n\u2192 C )) \n\n1.6\n(A \u2227 B) = (B \u2227\nA) \n\n1.7\n((A \u2227 B ) \u2192 C ) \u2192\n((A \u2227 ~C ) \u2192 ~B ) \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\nR1\n\u00a0 if \u22a2 A and \u22a2 (A \u2192\nB), then \u22a2 B (modus ponens) \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\nR2\n\u00a0 if \u22a2 A and \u22a2 B, then\n\u22a2 (A \u2227 B) (adjunction)  \n\n\nwhere \u25e6 is a primitive binary consistency operator, (A|B)\n(inconsistency) is defined as ~(A \u25e6 B),\nA = B is defined as (A \u2192 B)\n\u2227 (B \u2192 A), A \u2260 B as ~\n(A = B), and A \u2260 B \u2260\nC is an abbreviation of (A \u2260 B) \u2227\n(B \u2260 C) \u2227 (A \u2260 C).\n\nProviding a sound and complete semantics for NL is an\nopen problem in connexive logic. Angell\u2019s (1962) axiomatic proof\nsystem PA1 can also be seen as belonging to the\nproof-theoretical tradition because it is incomplete with respect the\ntruth tables presented by Angell. However, Angell proved\nPA1 to be sound with respect to these truth tables,\nthereby for the first time presenting a non-triviality proof for a\nformal system of connexive logic. Providing an intuitive\nsound and complete semantics for PA1 is another open\nproblem in connexive logic. (Routley [1978, p. 409] admits that his\ncharacterization is \u201cnot intuitively very satisfying: as it\nstands the modelling is rather complex, with the modelling conditions\nexceeding in number the postulates they model, and basic connexive\npostulates like Boethius, instead of being validated in a natural way,\nhave fairly intractable conditions.\u201d)\n\nIn proof-theoretic semantics, proof systems of a suitable form are\nseen as providing a meaning theory, see the entry\n proof-theoretic semantics.\n In that spirit, Francez (2016) presents two natural deduction proof\nsystems for a propositional language with negation and implication,\none in which AT, AT\u2032, BT, and BT\u2032 are provable, and\nanother one in which AT, AT\u2032, and the following variations of\nBoethius\u2019 theses are provable:\n\nB3: (A \u2192 B) \u2192 ~(~A \u2192\nB) and\n\nB4: (~A\u2192 B) \u2192 ~(A \u2192\nB).\n\n\nFrancez motivates these principles by certain natural language\ndiscourses and a \u201cdual Ramsey Test\u201d that modifies the\nRamsey test by assuming that in the course of arguing \u201cIf\np will q?,\u201d ~p is hypothetically\nadded to a stock of knowledge. Francez\u2019 natural deduction rules\nare straightforwardly obtained by modifying the natural deduction\nrules for the negation and implications fragment of David\nNelsons\u2019s four-valued constructive logic N4,\ncf. Kamide and Wansing 2012, in the manner that leads from\nN4 to the constructive connexive logic\nC from Wansing 2005, cf. section 4.5.1. In Francez\n2019 the natural deduction system that gives AT, AT\u2032, BT, and\nBT\u2032 is relevantized as in the familiar natural deduction proof\nsystem for the implication fragment of the relevant logic\nR by introducing subscripts for book-keeping in order\nto avoid empty, irrelevant implication introductions. Omori (2016b)\nadds conjunction and disjunction to the language of Francez 2016,\ngives an axiomatization and a characterizing semantics for the natural\ndeduction system that allows to prove B3 and B4, and observes that\nalthough AT and AT\u2032 are valid, BT, and BT\u2032 are invalid,\nwhich prompts him to call the provable equivalence ~(A \u2192\nB) \u2194 (~A \u2192 B)\n\u201chalf-connexive\u201d.\n\nThe natural deduction proof system in Wansing 2016b can be seen a\ncontribution to a bilateralist proof-theoretic semantics for certain\nconnexive logics given in terms of provability as well as refutability\nconditions. In addition to a connexive implication that internalizes a\nnotion of provability into the object language, there is also a\nconnexive co-implication that internalizes a refutability relation.\nThe resulting bi-connexive logic 2C is a connexive\nvariant of the bi-intuitionistic logic 2Int from\nWansing 2016a, 2018. A natural deduction calculus for a quantum logic\nsatisfying Aristotle\u2019s theses is presented in Kamide 2017.\n\nAccording to Schroeder-Heister 2009, Gentzen\u2019s sequent calculus\nis a \u201cmore adequate formal model of hypothetical\nreasoning\u201d than natural deduction, and proof-theoretic semantics\nhas also been developed with respect to various kinds of sequent\ncalculi. Sequent systems for connexive logics can be found in Wansing\n2007, Wansing 2008, McCall 2014, Kamide and Wansing 2011, 2016,\nKamide, Shramko and Wansing 2017, and Kamide 2019.\n",
