She\naims to replace them with a theory of perceptual knowledge that is\nreliable and supported by reasons. She urges a theory on which\nsensation, the reception of impressions by means of the senses, and\nunderstanding, the ability to deploy ideas that represent entities\ndistinct from impressions, work together to yield perceptual\nknowledge. In this respect, her system is more like that of Kant than\nthose of her other predecessors. But her doctrines express a highly\ndistinctive analysis of perception and the reality of its objects.\n\nCausality is the center of her metaphysical and epistemic systems.\nShepherd contends that the relation between cause and effect is one of\nefficacy, necessity, and simultaneity. She is an essentialist whose\nontology recognizes basic capacities, powers, and compound objects in\nnatural kinds. It anticipates recent essentialist theories on which\nproperties of objects in natural kinds are individuated as powers or\ndispositions (Fantl 2016; Wilson forthcoming) The first of her two\nbooks, Essay upon the Relation of Cause and Effect (Shepherd\n1824 abbreviated \u201cERCE\u201d), is chiefly concerned with\nderiving and developing this doctrine while pointing to errors in the\nreasoning of Hume and his followers. Her second volume, Essay on\nthe Perception of an External Universe (Shepherd 1827,\nabbreviated \u201cEPEU\u201d) includes a main text that uses causal\nreasoning to explain our knowledge of a universe of objects external\nto ourselves. It has a second part containing several short essays on\nrelated topics including Berkeley\u2019s idealism, final causes in\nnature, and why sensible qualities cannot be causes.\n", "toc": [{"#Biog": "1.

Biography\n\nThe main source of information about Shepherd\u2019s life is a family\nmemoir written by her daughter and published for private use\n(Brandreath 1886). Shepherd was born on an estate near Edinburgh where\nshe lived until she married in 1808. We know she was taught Latin,\ngeography, mathematics, and history by a private tutor who also\ndiscussed some philosophy (Brandreath 1886: 26). As a student, she\nchoose to write essays on metaphysics often faulting the logic of\nHume\u2019s atheistic writings and Priestly\u2019s Unitarianism\n(Brandreath 1881: 28\u20139). Her published works were written after\nher marriage. But in 1802, a controversy in Edinburgh made a lasting\nimpression on her. The incident prompted Thomas Brown to publish the\nfirst of several tracts defending Hume against the charge of atheism\nand advocating a universal constant conjunction account of cause and\neffect. Shepherd mentions this in her first book as a sign of the\npublic\u2019s susceptibility to the pernicious influence of Hume and\na motive for her literary project. ERCE devotes a chapter to\nobjections to Brown\u2019s regularity theory of causes and another to\ndetailed critique of the empirical results regarding the cause of\nsentience announced by William Lawrence, a physiologist who adopted\nHume\u2019s account of causation (on the latter, see Boyle 2021,\nPaoletti 2011, LoLordo forthcoming).\n\nIn the early 1820s, Shepherd accompanied her husband to Cambridge\nwhile he studied for a master\u2019s degree awarded in 1823. Although\nthere seems to be no record of the people she conversed with there, it\nmight well be that William Whewell, who held a university fellowship\nat that time, was among them. The family history records that he used\none of her books as a text book. He was deeply interested in devising\na workable and productive method of empirical inquiry but it was not\nuntil 1860 that he achieved his theory of induction (see the entry on\n William Whewell;\n on Shepherd\u2019s interest in shoring up scientific practice, see\nMcRobert 2002). Her daughter reports that he was a frequent guest of\nthe couple who resided in London. The Shepherds corresponded with\nCharles Babbage, who wrote a treatise on computational mathematical\ninduction (Babbage, 1989). The couple\u2019s social circle included\nmen and women of science, literary figures, and others of intellectual\naccomplishment. She was known for her unanswerable logic and passion\nfor abstract metaphysical reasoning.\n\nIn addition to works mentioned above, Shepherd published three\narticles: critical remarks on the metaphysics of John Fearn, a retired\nnaval officer (Shepherd 1828a), a very effective reply to\nFearn\u2019s counter-critique of her metaphysics (Shepherd 1832), and\nan article on the single and erect object of vision (Shepherd 1827b).\nIn the present article, we focus on her two main philosophical\n works.[1]\n\nThe merits of her work were publicly acknowledged in several ways.\nThere is good evidence that one of her monographs was used as a\ntextbook at Cambridge. Her part of a sharp philosophical dispute was\npublished in a monthly magazine. Her theory of mind and self are the\nsubject of an entry in Robert Blakey\u2019s multi-volume History\nof the Philosophy of Mind (1850). After her death and before its\nrecent recovery, her philosophy dropped from view for reasons that are\nnot entirely clear (Atherton 2005; Paoletti 2011).\n2. Doctrine of Cause and Effect\n2.1 Everything that begins to exist must have a cause\n\nShepherd\u2019s account of causality is advertised as contrary to\nDavid Hume\u2019s in point of metaphysics, psychology, and\nepistemology. Where Hume holds that common causal beliefs are due to\nrepetitious experience and acquired habits of imagination, she urges\nthey are caused and justified by perception and reasoning. Where Hume\nholds that abstract ideas are impossible, Shepherd insists that\nscience and philosophical analysis are impossible without abstraction.\nAgainst Hume, she argues that an uncaused change in the course of\nnature is impossible and produces a proof that everything that begins\nto exist must have a cause. According to her, the proof articulates a\nline of reasoning the human mind is disposed to use, implicitly or\nexplicitly, in forming causal beliefs, attaining knowledge of causal\nprinciples. and perceiving particular instances of them (e.g. EPEU\n[2020: 314\u2013316; Fantl 2016: 88). Incipient notions of causal\npower and necessary connection arise as children form their earliest\nbeliefs about sensible objects (e.g. EPEU: [2020: 314\u201324]).\n\nIt would not be correct to say this begs the question against Hume.\nShe has several reasons for rejecting his views on the relation of\ncause and effect. Perhaps the two most fundamental are the\nimpoverishment of a theory of mind that limits what we can apprehend\nto sensory and reflective impressions and things that resemble them,\nand the assumption that our ability to separate the idea of a cause\nfrom that of an effect in imagination shows the ideas are separable in\nnature and experience (Bolton 2010: 244\u20136; 2019: 132\u201338;\nLandy 2020b). Her theory of causality and causal induction are\nexpounded in ERCE; her account of the cause and justification of\nbelief in the external world is developed in EPEU. This section is\nmainly concerned with the former.\n\nThe first metaphysical tenet is the causal principle: it is necessary\nthat a thing that begins to exist has a cause (hereafter\n\u201cCP\u201d). The argument for this begins with a clarification.\nThe notion of an effect is semantically tied to that of a cause. To\navoid this implication, Shepherd characterizes an effect as a thing\nthat begins to exist; so clearly stated, the question is whether\n\u201ca thing that begins to exist owes its existence to a\ncause\u201d (ERCE [2020: 34). She proposes a thought experiment.\nImagine an object different in nature from all objects we know except\nfor the capacity for its existence, that is, the ground of the\npossibility of its existing when it does not yet exist. Suppose the\nuniverse is an utter blank; nothing exists.With this understood, she\nargues, it is impossible for the thing to begin to exist. This is\nbecause its beginning to exist \u201ccannot appear but as a capacity\nsome nature hath to alter the presupposed nonentity and to act for\nitself whilst it is not in being.\u201d (ERCE [2020: 36). One way to\nunderstand the reductive argument is this: (a) the beginning of\nx must be an act; (b) the act must be the property of an\nobject which exists and has the capacity to actualize x; (c)\nx does not yet exist; (d) nothing exists (supposition); so\nx cannot begin to exist. This is valid but premises (a) and\n(b) seem to assume what the argument is supposed to prove (Bolton\n2017; Fantl (2016: 98) also finds the argument circular). However,\nRickless (forthcoming) is among those who object to this charge; he\nargues it is doubtful the pair of premises means the same thing as the\nconclusion. Arguably, though, Shepherd assumes it does. She assumes\nthat her idea of what is needed to begin x specifies a state\nof affairs that satisfies her (controversial) idea of a cause. Nothing\nshows that this is a fact about the world.\n\nJennifer Wilson (forthcoming) interprets the argument as an effort to\narticulate the metaphysical reasoning behind the intuition that\nnothing comes from nothing. Like Shepherd, she stresses that anything\nthat begins to exist must have a beginning: a transition from the\nnon-existence to the existence of the entity in view. Wilson notes\nthat this act, or event, need not be the property of an object, but\nthere must be one or more things that perform it. This is said to\nexplain the intuition because it is independently plausible,\nmetaphysically possible, and no worse off epistemically than the\nalternative, This is consistent with the interpretation just offered,\nbut focused on a different issue: the need to connect non-being and\nbeing in direct opposition to Hume\u2019s principle of the\nseparability of all things that are different, by contrast with the\nmodal notions of metaphysical possibility and actuality,\n\nRickless (forthcoming) takes the main task of Shepherd\u2019s\nargument to be refuting the opinion that a thing\u2019s beginning is\nother than its not existing at one moment and existing at the next.\n(Hume asserts something like this but in terms of contraries\n\u201cnon-existent\u201d and \u201cexistent\u201d (T [2000:\n1.3.3.3])). Shepherd claims a thing begins only if there is something\nthat acts to begin it. Rickless suggests the strongest case that can\nbe made for this is illustrated by the fact that verbs such as\n\u201cto walk\u201d, \u201cto sing\u201d, and \u201cto\ncampaign\u201d signify acts or activities that begin only if a\nsubject starts to do them; e.g., a walk begins if an ambient being\nstarts to walk, and not otherwise. The generalization of this pattern\nis the implicit premise of the argument as Rickless interprets it, One\nmight object that an agent that single handedly begins to do an\nactivity is not a cause by Shepherd\u2019s definition, so this\nargument may not prove anything she wants to hold. Rickless goes on to\nmake an important point about Shepherd\u2019s argument: it treats\n\u201cexists\u201d as a predicate. This makes it vulnerable to\nHume\u2019s doctrine that the idea of existence is the same as the\nidea of the object that exists; to think of an object is to think of\nit as existent (T [2000: 1.2.8.4]). So even though Shepherd\u2019s\nargument, as Rickless understands it, is cogent, Hume has ground on\nwhich to resist it (as does Kant). This is true, but she has a case\nto make. Shepherd respects Hume\u2019s preference for\n\u201cnon-existent\u201d rather than \u201cnot in existence\u201d (see ERCE [2000:\n37\u20138]). But she herself holds we have ideas of existence that\nare modally and temporally qualified and explicitly argues that we\nhave a general idea of existence (EPEU [2020: 82\u20136]).\n\nAll derivations of the argument for CP found in the texts have\npremises formulated in the terminology of the theory of cause and\neffect Shepherd promotes. Most of them refer to things that begin to\nexist as \u201cqualities\u201d of \u201cobjects.\u201d According\nto Shepherd\u2019s list of non-Humean definitions: a cause is\n\u201csuch an action of an object, as shall enable it, in conjunction\nwith another, to form a new nature, capable of exhibiting qualities\nvarying from those of either object in separation from the other. This\nis really to be a producer of new being\u201d (ERCE [2000: 63]). An\neffect is defined as \u201cthe produced quality exhibited to the\nsenses, as the essential property of natures so conjoined.\u201d An\nobject is defined as \u201ca combined mass of qualities; the result\nof proportional unknown circumstances in nature, meeting with the\nhuman senses\u201d (ERCE [2000: 64]). According to these definitions,\nwe can say a cause is part of a configuration comprising: first, the\nantecedent existence of two or more objects that taken together ground\nthe possibility of the existence of some quality Q when it does not\nyet exist; second, the two objects\u2019 uniting and thereby forming\na new object that is the cause of newly existent Q; and third, the\nobject\u2019s being perceived with Q as its essential property.\n\nA distinctive, perhaps unique, feature of Shepherd\u2019s metaphysics\nis that the objects we believe to exist in the world are partly in us\n(mind dependent) and partly unknown, exterior to, and independent of\nminds and sensory organs. Objects, for her, are objects as we perceive\nthem; they are not fully formed unless perceived (see e.g. EPEU [2020:\n72\u20133, 93]). That is, sensible qualities such as figures and\ncolors are not external properties of mind independent objects (as\ne.g. Locke wants to say), nor sensations existing only in minds (as\nBerkeley maintains), but relations that span the mind and scarcely\nknown entities outside the mind. She faults Berkeley for holding that\nsensible objects are only ideas, not for holding that they are ideas\n(e.g. EPEU [2020; 195\u2013213]). (Atherton1996 and Rickless 2018\ndisagree about whether Shepherd misunderstands Berkeley\u2019s\nidealism.)\n\nIn regard to ontology, the preexisting entities that ground the\npossibility of the existence of so far non-existent qualities are\nregularly called \u201cobjects\u201d, \u201cnatures\u201d,\n\u201cmasses of qualities\u201d, or \u201cunknown circumstances in\nnature;\u201d occasionally, they are designated by other terms (e.g.\n\u201csubstance\u201d (ERCE [2000: 53; EPEU [2020: 388)). Also,\n\u201cpower\u201d is synonymous with \u201cefficient cause, or\nproductive principle;\u201d it stands for \u201cthe property that\nlies in the secret nature of objects, when unobserved by the senses,\nand which determines the qualities that can be exhibited to them upon\nevery new conjunction\u201d (ERCE [2000: 63\u20134]). Jeremy Fantl\n(2016) takes this to suggest an ontology in which objects are bundles\nof qualities, powers are basic (unreduced), and qualities are\nindividuated by the causal powers contributed by these qualities. If\nthis is right, it is natural to assume that objects are individuated\nby their causal powers or the qualities their powers determine (Fantl\nproposes the former). Shepherd does not use the term\n\u201cindividuate\u201d, but relies on the notion of properties that are\nessential to individuals (see especially ERCE [2000; 48, 57, 63; EPEU\n[2020; 242, 243\u20133]). (Fields (forthcoming) argues that Shepherd\ndoes not have a bundle theory.)\n\nThe secondary literature has little to say about Shepherd\u2019s\nessentialism but there are many indications that it is heavily\ninfluenced by a doctrine of Locke: \u201cEssence may be taken for the\nvery being of anything, whereby it is what it is. And thus the real\ninternal, but generally in Substances, unknown Constitutions of\nThings, whereon their discoverable Qualities Depend, may be called\ntheir Essence\u201d (E [1975: 3.3.15]); this motivates Locke\u2019s\ndistinction between real and nominal essences of kinds). LoLordo\n(2200: 5\u20139) brings out Shepherd\u2019s interest in downplaying\nLocke\u2019s worry that the observable qualities of individual bodies\nfail to display divisions that might be regarded as delineating inner\nconstitutions; she also argues that Shepherd regards herself as the\ntrue heir of Locke\u2019s legacy. Beyond that, however, her\nmetaphysical system seems to have been inspired, at least in part, by\nLocke\u2019s notion of essence. Shepherd is convinced that the\npatterns of change we observe among sensible objects manifest what\nthey essentially are, namely causes that essentially produce the\neffects they do (e.g. ERCE [2000: 43\u20135, 47\u20139]). For\ninstance, \u201cFire \u2026 must of necessity burn as much as it\nmust be red, otherwise the red object were not fire\u201d (ERCE\n[2000: 54]). It is true that some similar passages add that the stuff\nwould not be properly called \u201cfire\u201d but this is because it\nwould not be fire. Shepherd expresses the modal demand an essence\nmakes on an object by the term \u201cobligation\u201d and uses it to\ndefine what Hume calls \u201cnecessary connection\u201d of cause and\neffect (ERCE [2000; 63]). This strongly suggests the necessity she\nascribes to causality is an expression of her essentialism.\n\nThe synchrony of cause and effect follows from the non-Humean\ndefinitions of cause, effect, object, and power. The union of two\nantecedently separate objects forms a new mass of qualities that\nincludes at least one quality that did not previously exist. The newly\nformed mass is the mass that includes the novel quality. The new\nobject does not exist until the union is complete. As Shepherd puts\nit, \u201c[I]n their union, there exists those newly formed objects,\nor masses of qualities called Effects, \u2026 for in this union\nCause and Effect are synchronous, and they are but different words for\nthe same Essence\u201d (ERCE [2000: 57]). As interpreted here, the\nnewly formed object and newly formed quality have synchronous\nexistence: one exists at a time if and only if the other does.\n\nDavid Landy (2020a) offers a different interpretation of the argument\nfor synchrony which he uses to construct a defense against\nHume\u2019s contention that if causes and effects were\ncontemporaneous, then all objects would exist at the same time (see T\n[2000: 1.3.2.7]). On this reading, if a quality begins to exist, the\ntransition from two separate objects to one unified object passes\nthrough a \u201cvanishingly short instant\u201d in which the\nantecedents and their union overlap and \u201call three must exist\nsynchronically\u201d (Landy 2020a: 4). This is problematic because\nsynchrony for a moment is too brief for the relation between an object\nand one of its essential qualities (compare Landy 2020a: 4, note 8).\nWe might also mention that if the separate antecedents and the unified\nobject literally existed at the same time, the union of antecedents\nwould be complete and incomplete at that time (see ERCE [2000:\n50]).\n2.2 Similar causes must have similar effects\n\nShepherd propounds a second causal maxim which we can call the\n\u201cCausal Similarity Principle\u201d (hereafter\n\u201cCSP\u201d): similar causes must have similar effects (ERCE\n[2000: 43\u20139, 53\u20135]). Some scholars assume CSP and CP are\non an epistemic par, both known a priori on the basis of nothing but\nShepherd\u2019s concept of causality (LoLordo 2019: 11; Bolton 2019:\n149). This has prompted the objection that CSP does not solve\nHume\u2019s epistemic problem. He asks for the necessary connection\nbetween things such as smoke and fire which have been regularly\nconjoined in experience: what entitles us to infer other cases will be\nthe same? To reply that CSP is a general conceptual truth is\nempty\u2014as if to say, otherwise the instances in question would\nnot be the same (see Ott 2011, quoted and glossed by LoLordo 2019).\nThere seems to be a disqualifying objection to this: CSP is not an a\npriori truth based on nothing but concepts. It is derived from CP but\nin conjunction with an a posteriori premise with existential\nimport.\n\nBefore we look at this, it is worth mention that Tanner (2022)\nsuggests that although Shepherd\u2019s causal metaphysics implies that\nnature is uniform, i.e. things in the same kind must have similar\neffects, in the absence of a reason to believe the metaphysical\ntheory, she offers nothing that answers Hume\u2019s demand to be shown a\nreason to believe the similarity thesis.This weakness is overcome,\nTanner suggests, if the causal metaphysics is conjoined with a\nprinciple of parsimony that governs the number of natural kinds we\nshould recognize, The conjunction is not the sort of reason Hume has\nin view, but it is a rational justification for belief of the\nsimilarity thesis. This may be true, but there is textual evidence\nthat the causal principles themselves are epistemically founded on\nperceptual knowledge of the world (see below in this section and the\nnext).. The argument for CSP is made in several ways, but all of\nthem have two parts. One reviews the circumstances in which we come to\nbelieve there is a particular cause when observing that a quality\nbegins to exist. This introduces a premise with modal and referential\nfeatures that set her account of causal beliefs apart from\nHume\u2019s. The second part offers Shepherd\u2019s reflection on an\nobject similar to one we believe to cause a certain quality to begin\nits existence: if the two are in similar circumstance, what effects\ncan the duplicate have in view of CP? The upshot is that the\nderivation of CSP has a premise that limits its scope to objects that\nexist,\n\n\nOne derivation of CSP argues, contra Hume, that when we first\nperceive some kind of thing, we may very well discover something about\nits cause by \u201creasoning on an experiment\u201d (ERCE [2000:\n45]). When we are aware that some quality begins to exist and believe\nit has a particular cause, we typically observe qualities of objects\nthat are present shortly before it appears. In favorable\ncircumstances, there are two and only two discernible objects which\ncoalesce at the moment the new quality begins to exist. For example,\nif you pour vinegar into milk and see that it immediately breaks into\ncurds and whey, you are likely to believe the mixture of the two was\nthe cause of newly curdled\n milk.[2]\n The second part of the derivation is a reflection on two similar\nliquids mixed in the same way. Shepherd argues that if the second did\nnot have the same effect as the first, then either something caused an\nalteration in the second, so they are not the same, or it caused an\nalteration in itself, which is impossible according to CP (ERCE [2000:\n45, 46, 48\u20139]). We should ask why this matters given that the\nproposition just asserted is circular and without extensional\nimport.\n\nIn another derivation of CSP, the first part invokes definitions that\naccrue to particular objects that we believe to cause specific\neffects: \u201cIf then an existence now in being, conjoined with any\nother, forms thereby a new nature, capable of exhibiting new\nqualities, these new qualities must enter into the definition of the\nobjects; they become part of their natures\u201d (ERCE [2000: 47]).\nCompiled from the experiences that inform us of the existence of\nparticular causes, such definitions report the sensible qualities and\nother circumstances observed just prior to the novel appearance of one\nor more qualities and record the observed effects of the newly formed\nobject. Provided the antecedently observed sensible qualities are\nprobable indicators of the kinds of previously existing objects\nfrom which the new object results, a definition specifies two markers\nof the kind to which the new object belongs. We can call on them in\ncollecting evidence that two objects are similar and predicting their\neffects under various circumstances. This is the case whether or\nnot any of the antecedent natures (powers) are included in the\nconstitution of the newly formed nature (see ERCE [2000: 189]). So the\ndefinition of an object purports to pick out all and only objects that\nare exactly alike in respect of the powers they amass. (To be clear,\nthe subjects of definitions are particular objects; the definition of\na particular object is the definition of the natural kind to which it\nbelongs if kinds are individuated by causal powers; see section 2.1,\nFantl 2016),)\n\nThat CSP is made true by the constituents of actual objects is also\nshown by the reflection that completes this derivation. Shepherd\nargues that elicited objects are determined as composites: e.g. when a\nfire is elicited from the juncture of two other objects, the\n\u201ccombined qualities\u201d that begin to exist are \u201cthe\nwhole qualities that fire, in every circumstance is capable of\nproducing\u201d (ERCE [2000: 49,\n 54]).[3]\n The truth of CSP is founded on the doctrine that the method of its\nformation fixes the constitution of the resulting object, so similar\nformative origins determine similar constitutions. Rounding the\nderivation out: so on another occasion, the same pre-conditions are\n\u201cnecessarily compelled\u201d to be attended with the same\neffects, or combined qualities: otherwise there would be the\n\u201cbeginnings of existence by themselves\u201d (ERCE [2000 49,\n47\u201348, 52\u201355]). Although the circular maxim has a part\nhere, it is not what makes CSP true.\n\nDefinitions of objects are used to rebuff Hume\u2019s contention that\nthe course of nature can change spontaneously, without a cause that\nalters it. She argues against his examples. He claims it is possible\nthat a body otherwise like snow should burn the skin and taste salty;\nagain, fruit trees that have regularly borne fruit in warm weather may\nsomeday be productive in freezing cold. Shepherd counters that\nalthough the stuff otherwise like snow may well be possible, it would\nnot be snow; rather than marking a change in natures\u2019 course, it\nwould be a different object with qualities arising from different\ncircumstances depending on nature\u2019s course. Again, \u201conce\nthe proof has been afforded\u201d that the nature of fruit trees\nrequires warmth if they are to grow and flower, it must be considered\nimpossible for them to have qualities \u201cnot originally in their\nnatures\u201d (ERCE [2000; 81]).\n\nAt bottom, Shepherd\u2019s causal metaphysics rests on the intuition\nthat the formation of an object renders it what it is. It applies also\nin mathematics (EPEU [2020:: 279]). Shepherd takes mathematical\nobjects to be particular things constructed by placing physical items\nin spatial relations or relations understood to be arithmetical. Their\nproperties are known by inspection, comparison, and the like:\n\u201cmy whole notion of the relation of cause and effect is aptly\nimagined by the nature of the necessary results, included in the\njuxtaposition of quantities\u201d (EPEU [2020: 282]). Shepherd holds\nthat the general truths of natural science for which we have empirical\nevidence are necessary and the necessary truths of arithmetic and\ngeometry are believed partly on the basis of experience (Bolton 2019:\n149\u201352; LoLordo 2019: 11).\n2.3 Definitions and other a posteriori necessary truths\n\nDefinitions of objects have attracted attention for several reasons.\nOne is that they. are holistic in the minimal sense that any given\nkind of object is defined in terms of other kinds of objects or\nqualities. For instance, fire can be defined as the object elicited by\nconcussion of flint and steel, and flint can be defined as the object\nthat, combined with steel, gives rise to fire. Some scholars worry\nthat Shepherd\u2019s definitions of natural kinds form a closed\nsystem that is impervious to refutation and seek a solution to the\nproblem. It seems those who have this worry assume the\ndefinitions in question are descriptive and to some extent formed\nwithout empirical guidance\u2014Locke\u2019s nominal essences in\neffect, As interpreted here, however, the definitions Shepherd has in\nview are formed on the basis of experience; they state the essential\nproperties of actual objects. She may think the meanings of names of\nkinds in a natural language are based on them.\n\nDefinitions have also attracted attention because they are a\nposteriori necessary truths. Kant has an account of how we can know\nsuch truths, but Shepherd does not follow him in distinguishing\nanalytic and synthetic judgments (LoLordo 2019: 10, note 25). She does\nnot address this issue in the direct sort of way we might expect. The\nissue for her is how we acquire knowledge and belief of the existence\nof the external world and the causal principles that are its\nfoundations. It turns out that this is knowledge of roughly the sort\nKant found he needed to explain. Perceptual knowledge is the topic of\nsection 3.1.\n3. Knowledge of the existence of an external world\n3.1 Perceptual knowledge and reason\n\nThere is considerable evidence that Shepherd has a foundational theory\nof perceptual knowledge, e.g. \u201cReason does establish this\nbeautiful and certain proposition, which is the foundation of all our\nknowledge\u2014That like causes must ever produce like Effects\u201d\n(ERCE [2000: 143\u20134]). The principles of the theory of causation\n\u201cregulate every opinion speculative and practical\u201d (EPEU\n[2020: xiii, 190]). The epistemic foundations of our knowledge\nare the basic causal principles. Because knowledge of causal\nprinciples is secured somehow by reason, she wants to suggest, they\nare less subject to doubt than those offered by Hume (EPEU\n[2020: 27\u20138]). Yet the most sharply focused issue about\nShepherd\u2019s epistemology discussed in the literature is the part\nreason plays in knowledge.\n\nAs we saw, Shepherd holds we have an idea of a cause adequate for an\nargument for CP. Fantl (2016) and Bolton (2019) assume this is an\nexample of knowing a principle by reason. But this is difficult to\nmake out. Fantl interprets the argument as a thought experiment\nsupposed to reduce the denial of CP to a contradiction, but finds no\nunproblematic way to state the argument. Bolton interprets it as a\nvalid, but circular, argument which implies nothing about what happens\nin the world.\n\nFolescu (2020) objects to these accounts mainly because they take the\nargument to confer knowledge. She finds the view that CP is a\nfoundational principle, i.e. a proposition known without basis in\nknowledge of another proposition, to be in tension with the view that\nCP is established by an argument. As Folescu understands it, the\nargument for CP is analytic yet we are said to know the principle; she\nconcludes it is known without proof. This is confirmed by the fact\nthat shortly after stating this argument, Shepherd asks readers to\ngrant the causal principle so she can use it in making her points\nagainst Hume (ERCE [2000: 39]; EPEU [2020: 164, note 9]). So, Folescu\nmaintains, although Shepherd sometimes seems to say causal principles\ncan be demonstrated, she ought not to (e.g. Folescu: 13\u201314). To\nmy mind, this is right and helpful.\n\nThen what does reason contribute to our knowledge of the existence of\nthe external world? As Folescu interprets it, reason constructs\narguments which have a role similar to that of proofs in the practice\nof early twentieth century mathematicians who built axiomatic theories\nabout neglected subjects such as sets. She provides an instructive\npicture of their use of proofs to motivate acceptance of certain\npropositions as axioms by bringing out the benefits it brings, e.g.\nadopting an axiom may greatly increase the usefulness of the theory\n(Folescu 17\u201319 ). But our interest is in Shepherd\u2019s\naccount of knowledge of foundational principles, or first principles.\nFolescu quotes a neglected passage which states that first principles\nare a sort of perception: \u201cFirst principles are the perceptions\nof the corollaries, inclusions, or necessary relations of our simple\nimpressions, and infants who have not a capacity fitted to generate\nsuch perceptions are born idiots\u201d (EPEU [2020: 314], quoted in\nFolescu (2020: 11). Taking this to say first principles are\nknown without proof and characterizing this as a sort of intuitive\nknowledge, Folescu mentions two sources known to Shepherd that might\nhave influenced her: Locke and Reid. Locke contrasts\nintuitive and demonstrative knowledge. Briefly put, he holds we know a\nproposition by intuition just in case when we join two ideas in accord\nwith a proposition-making relation, we perceive relations among the\ncombined representations which are sufficient to show the proposition\nis true; we have demonstrative knowledge if the truth is perceived\nonly with aid of intuitive perception of intermediary truths (E [1975:\n4.2.1\u20133; 4.7.1]). We might say, intuition presents us with\nrepresentational evidence of truth. According to Reid\u2019s doctrine\nthat we have intuitive knowledge of the principles of common sense, a\nproposition known by intuition is believed as soon as it is\nunderstood; it is known without seeking evidence or inferring it from\nsomething else; knowledge of a principle is \u201cthe work of nature,\nand our original powers.\u201d (EPI [2002: 452: quoted by Folescu\n(2020: 12). According to Reid, intuitive knowledge is self evident in\nthat it neither has nor needs evidence of the proposition\u2019s\ntruth.\n\nFolescu argues that Shepherd\u2019s position has more in common with\nReid\u2019s theory than Locke\u2019s. She notes that Reid recognizes\nthe utility of arguments about epistemically basic principles that\nbring out the advantages of endorsing them as axioms; in this\nconnection, he explicitly mentions reductio proofs. She\nsuggests Shepherd intends CP to make the fundamental principle\naccessible to reasoning and to bring out its self-evident truth.\nFolescu admits Shepherd is critical of Reid\u2019s appeal to human\nnature or instinct to explain the foundations of knowledge. But,\nFolescu explains, Shepherd misses the point that Reid\u2019s theory\nis not unlike her own. On this interpretation, Shepherd maintains that\nfirst principles are known by intuition in the manner of Reid and she\nrecognizes that psychological explanations of belief of first\nprinciples are useful for the general advancement of knowledge,\n\nThis brief summary does not do justice to the sophistication and\nsubtlety of Folescu\u2019s discussion of the interplay of psychology\nand epistemology in Shepherd\u2019s thought. But the interpretation\nis open to the objection that Shepherd\u2019s critique of Reid is\nsquarely addressed to the doctrine he holds, and on many occasions.\nFor instance, Reid \u201ccuts the knot instead of untying it\u201d\nby referring belief in the existence of body to a natural instinct.\nThis is because it offers no satisfactory reason for belief or detail\nabout how it arises ([EPEU [2020: 5, 111\u201312]). Shepherd\npropounds a more complex account:\n\nThe class of ideas which Dr. Reid terms instinctive \u2026 I\nconsider to be the conclusions of a latent reasoning: as the mere\nresults and corollaries, included in the relation of those ideas and\nsensations already existing in the mind, and which were previously\nformed by the senses. (EPEU [2020: 170])\n\n\n As she sees it, perception is not a primitive inexplicable\ndisposition; but it is \u201cno more than an observation of the\nsimplest relations of our ideas\u2014It is but a simple\ninference of the understanding\u2026\u201d (EPEU [2020:\n113, 3, 8]) This and other texts strongly suggest that reason confers\nknowledge because it is the ability to grasp a relation between ground\nand consequent. Yet reason is the means by which we perceive the\nexistence of external objects. Although Folescu\u2019s reading neatly\nresolves a tension between the foundational status of CP and view that\nwe know the principle by means of an argument, it can also be seen as\nopening the way for an alternative resolution, namely, that Shepherd\nrecognizes more than one basis on which reason can respond to an\nepistemic relation between ground and consequent and rests causal and\nperceptual knowledge on one of them.\n\nBefore saying more about this, we should get clear about what Shepherd\nmeans by \u201cperception.\u201d She explicitly disagrees with\nReid\u2019s theory that sensations always precede acts of perception\nbut are entirely extrinsic to them; for him, sensations are\nintentional blanks that merely trigger the mind\u2019s formation of\nthe concept of an object and firm belief in its existence. By\ncontrast, when she uses the word \u201cperception\u201d it is\n\u201cin the sense of \u2018a consciousness of sensation\u2019, a\nSENSATION TAKEN NOTICE OF BY THE MIND\u201d ([EPEU [2020:\n6\u20139]).\n\nThe continuation of one of Shepherd\u2019s objections to Reid\npartially quoted above is more forthcoming. The gist is that\nperception is \u201cthe observation of the simplest relations of\nour ideas\u201d; this is analyzed as \u201ca simple inference\nof the understanding;\u201d this is broken down to \u201cthe\nperception of the CONSCIOUS SENSE (which takes notice when it is\naffected)\u201d together with \u201cthe perception of THE\nUNDERSTANDING\u201d to the effect that the sense organs and mind must\nbe affected by objects external to both. Shepherd adds: \u201cthis\ninference \u2026 is knowledge rather than instinct\u201d (EPEU\n[2020: 113]).\n\nThis is no more than a sketch, but three things are clear. First, we\nhave two types of perceptual knowledge: consciousness of juxtaposed\nsensations and understanding that some sensations are caused by\nparticular objects distinct from the amassed sensations. Second, the\nrelations discovered by understanding are inferred from\nthe\u2014presumably temporal\u2014relations of juxtaposition\nperceived by consciousness; i.e. the order among a mass of sensations\nknown by consciousness provides some sort of basis from which\nunderstanding infers the existence of a particular object that causes\ncertain sensations. (See especially the objection to Brown\u2019s\ntheory of instinctive belief (ERCE [2000: 138, 146]).) Third, if two\nor more sensations are juxtaposed in consciousness, their relation is\npart of a more comprehensive relation between items of consciousness\nand objects unavailable to consciousness which is the locus of the\ncausal relation (see the dichotomy of inner and outer existences,\nsection 3.2). An interpretation on which reason confers perceptual\nknowledge because it is inferential has considerable textual\nsupport.\n\nIt is clear, Shepherd holds we can, and sometimes do, deliberately\nargue from observed relations among things we perceive by sense to\nconclusions about relations among the (unknown) objects that cause\nthem. She holds that although sensations are essentially felt and can\nbe essentially like nothing but sensations, they have non-essential\nrelations to other things, such as variety, sameness, contrariety, and\nproportionality. She argues that there must be relations among\nsensible quality sensations accumulated in experience that are similar\nto relations among their respective causes. This is because if the\nsensory system and the mind are functioning well, they always operate\nin the same way, so the differences among temporally ordered\nsensations must be due to corresponding differences among their causes\ntaken in the same order (EPEU [2020: 4749, 63\u2013165,\n703\u2013704]). Not that the corresponding relations must be exactly\nthe same, but the same in some respect. Shepherd likens this to the\nLondon diorama, an elaborate three dimensional walk-in illusion of the\ncity famous in her day; she often makes an analogy with algebraic\nsigns used to calculate the values of their significations under an\ninterpretation, and sometimes a language that needs\ninterpretation (e.g. Boyle, 2020: 100),\n3.2 Psychology of belief in the external world\n\n\u201cAll we know must be by means of consciousness, or\nsensations,\u201d according to Shepherd (EPEU [2020: 7]). In\nher usage, \u201csensation\u201d is a general term for everything of\nwhich a sentient being is conscious (EPEU [2020: 6,\n133\u201360]). There are two classes of sensations: those that are\nsensible qualities (colors, figures, etc.) and sensations of ideas.\nSensations that are sensible qualities are always caused in part by\nthe use of organs of sense and attended by sensations caused by using\nthem. They have an \u201cimmediate incontrovertible evidence\u201d (EPEU\n[2020:142, 700]). Ideas, but not sensations of them, refer to things\ndistinct from sensations. Strictly speaking, an idea is \u201cthe\nresult of that reasoning or observation which shows that there must\nneeds to an existence when we cannot perceive it\u201d (EPEU [2020:\n133\u20134]).\n\nShepherd undertakes to explain three common beliefs about the objects\nof perception: their existence is continued, outside the mind, and\nmind-independent. What is to be explained is how sensations can lead\nto these beliefs about objects in view of the discrepancy between what\nwe know about the former and the properties we ascribe to the latter.\nThe first issue is: \u201cWhence we know of any continued existence,\nwhen we can immediately know nothing but our sensations\u201d (EPEU\n[2020; 20]). Sensations are interrupted, for example, by dreamless\nsleep and by their constantly arising, perishing, and being replaced.\nHer general procedure is to argue that sensations we acquire in\nexperience display various patterns that must have causes with the\nproperties just mentioned. The aim is to show that reasoning provides\nreasons, or motives. for holding the common beliefs. The reasons may\nnot have propositional form and they have various degrees of\nperspicuity, but all mentally competent human beings, regardless of\nage, are conscious of them e.g. EPEU: [2020: 16\u201317, 71, 106)].\nBecause Shepherd gives minds to all sentient organisms, they too are\nsaid to be conscious of reasons to believe the things they perceive\nare continued, external, and independent (Fasko forthcoming).\n\nWith regard to continued existence, a mass of sensations exhibits many\nseries of sensible qualities that recur. For instance when you look at\na house while walking by, you are conscious of a series of visual\nimages and if you happen to retrace your steps, the same series\nappears in reverse order. Shepherd argues that whenever we are\nconscious of a series of sensible quality sensations that is repeated,\nwe comprehend that each repetition must have a cause that continues to\nexist \u201cready to answer the irregular call of the senses\u201d\n(EPEU: [2020: 15\u201316]). Otherwise, each would have a cause\ncreated explicitly for the purpose of being ready to mix with sensory\norgans when needed; or if not, different recurrences would begin of\nthemselves. Consciousness of his reasoning enables us to have an idea\nof existence continued unperceived but only consciousness of\ninterrupted sensations (EPEU [2020: 134]).\n\nWe say we perceive \u201cexternal\u201d objects. Shepherd offers to\nclarify the difference between what is external and internal:\n.\u201cInward existence is the capacity for sensation in general;\noutward existence is the exciting cause of some sensation in\nparticular\u201d (EPEU [2020: 40]). The capacity for sensation in\ngeneral is the mind. The cause of a particular sensation results from\nthe mixing of the mind and an object that needs to be outside the mind\nin order to mix with it. Accordingly, sensations are inward,\ninterrupted, and can be known by only one subject, whereas what is\noutward has continued existence and can be perceived by more than one\nhuman being, if other human beings are possible (EPEU [2020: 40]). So\none reason to believe that the causes of sensible quality sensations\nexist outside the mind is that we infer it from the belief that they\ncontinue to exist unperceived. Others are offered as well.\n\nShepherd takes a particular interest in explaining why, despite our\nconviction that sensations exist if only if they are perceived, we\nsomehow assume that sensations exist outside the mind. For instance, a\ncolored, figured, extended object is commonly considered to exist in\nits colored, figured, extended state when it is no longer perceived.\nYet color, figure and extension are mental affections (EPEU [2020:\n39]). Shepherd denies that this can be understood or even believed\nbecause of its manifest impossibility. The doxastic performance is\nsaid to be due to our belief that the particular object that causes a\nparticular sensible quality must be outside the mind, on one hand, and\nthe paucity of our resources for recalling the object, on the other\nhand. After we perceive, say, an apple, our only way to think of it or\ndistinguish it from other objects is under the form of its sensible\nqualities. This is said to produce a natural association of thought\nthat links sensations and their causes so tightly that philosophical\nanalysis is required to pry them apart. She reports several\nextravagant and mutually inconsistent theories philosophers have\nproposed in the effort to separate sensations and objects outside the\nmind; Reid, Malebranche, Leibniz, as well as Berkeley and Hume are\nmentioned (EPEU [2020: 45\u20136]). She easily uncouples the\nassociation by stressing the difference between inward and outward\nexistence based on her theory of the relation of cause and effect\n(EPEU [2020: 71, 114]).\n\nShepherd advances three reasons that motivate belief that perceptual\nobjects are mind\n independent.[4]\n One is that we believe objects we perceive undergo change of sensible\nqualities when we are not perceiving them. Another is, in brief, we\nbelieve there are beings like ourselves who have the power of thought\nand feeling, and we perceive that one external object can affect many\nsuch beings; (EPEU [2020: 76\u201381]). She also constructs an\nargument intended to show that we can form an abstract general idea of\nexistence, or the notion of \u201cindefinite unknown existence\u201d\nwhich enables us to have thoughts of continued, external, and entirely\nindependent existence (EPEU [2020: 82\u201326]).\n3.3 The phenomena of dreams and only possible basis of skepticism\n\nThe phenomena of dreams are thought to pose an objection to belief in\nthe existence of the external world because we may credit the illusory\nimages with continued, external, independent existence. This is reason\nto doubt the existence of all perceptual objects unless we have better\nevidence for their reality than we have for that of the seeming\nobjects of dreams. Shepherd dispatches the objection. She grants that\nsensations that occur in dreams are like those that occur in waking\nexperience although she denies that dreams can cause the same\nsensations in the same order as those caused by objects existing in\nnature (EPEU [2020: 99\u2013100]). She argues that when dreaming, a\nperson\u2019s ability to collect a large number of sensations is\nlimited. When awake, we can move our eyes and limbs and find the\nsupposed object does not fulfill its definition (e.g. EPEU [2020:\n29\u201333]). She allows that assuming we are awake, it is difficult\nto know whether an object that has fulfilled its presumed definition\nso far will do so later on. Judgments on this question can be\nsupported by observations that make them more or less probable and\nthus subject to an appropriate level of doubt (ERCE [2020:\n99\u2013114]). Still, she admits there is one (but only one) possible\nbasis for skepticism about the reality of perceptual objects:\nexperience cannot show that the causes of all a person\u2019s\nsensations are not necessarily mixed with the causes of her dreams\n(EPEU [2020: 118\u201319]).\n4. Mind, body, and self\n4.1 Minds and bodies\n\nMind is the capacity for sensation in general, that is, the capacity\nfor thought and feeling. We ourselves are individual minds (EPEU\n[2020: 14, 24]). Many of Shepherd\u2019s predecessors hold that the\npotentiality of causal capacities is ultimately grounded in substances\nin which the capacities inhere. Shepherd rarely uses the term\n\u201csubstance\u201d (but see EPEU [2020: 388]; ERCE [2000: 162)\nbut she ascribes a substance-like property to minds. This is the\nupshot of two arguments based on the idea that the mind is a dual\ncapacity, for both particular sensations, which continuously vanish\nand are followed by others, and for sensation as such, which is\nresumed after periods of dreamless sleep. The argument comes down to\nthis: there would be no reason for the existence of sensation unless\nthere were a continuous being that is specifically \u201cindifferent\nto sensations [and] capable of being excited when interfered with by\nqualities fitted to produce it.\u2014Such a being is the subject of\nsuccessive sensations,\u2014such is the capacity for\nsensation,\u2014such is the mind\u201d (EPEU [2020: 375\u20136;\nalso 56\u20137]). A mind endures\u2014it is one subject of different\nsuccessive states each dependent for existence on it. But unlike a\ntraditional substance, its successive states are effects rather than\npowers; it is a dispositional rather than categorical entity; and a\nmind is external to each of its states and can exist with no states at\nall. \u201cThus the pronoun I is ever abstract and stands\nfor a BEING exterior to, and independent of all the changes of which\nit is conscious.\u201d (EPEU [2020: 57]). This seems to show Shepherd\nhas no use for traditional substances (see LoLordo (forthcoming); but\nBoyle 2020: 101, note 19; 104) finds that minds inhere in natures in\nthe substance theoretical sense.).\n\nThe conclusion that a mind is the continually existing subject of\nsuccessive states proves its eternality. It seems the \u201cmysterious\neternal power of feeling\u201d is inherited by each individual member\nof a species: \u201cas a continuous existence it must be an eternal\npower in nature and as immortal for the future as it must have been\nwithout beginning in the past\u201d (EPEU [2020: 377]). This is\nmotivated by an implicit appeal to CP: \u201cthere would be no\nreason\u201d, i.e. cause, for sensations if there were no continuing\nsubject matter ready to be interfered with by other suitable objects\n(EPEU [2020: 375\u20136]), partly quoted in the previous paragraph;\n[2020: 56\u20137]). More generally, it is a principle of\nShepherd\u2019s metaphysics that capacities for being are eternal\n(EPEU [2020: 389\u2013390]). Matter and time are eternal capacities\n(EPEU [2020: 127, 389\u2013390]). The consequences of this principle for\nthe causal structure of the universe have not, to my knowledge, been\ndiscussed in the literature. Shepherd uses the principle in stating\nher argument for the existence of God (EPEU [2020: 389\u2013392; also\n190\u2013191]). This argument, which includes a version of the teleological\nargument used to show there must be an eternal entity with mental\npowers, purports to show that God is the continuously existing subject\nof all changes (Loscano (2019) offers an account). The details of the\ndependence relation between the infinite subject of all changes and\nthe objects that begin and cease to exist in nature are of\nconsiderable interest. LoLordo (forthcoming) brings out similarities\nto Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics; Garrett (forthcoming) considers it in\nconnection with the question whether Shepherd is able to reconcile her\ndenial of idealism with the causality of God, but finds the texts\ninconclusive.\n\nShepherd argues that minds are not material beings on the evidence\nthat bodies in general do not feel in circumstances in which\nindividual minds do, e.g. a rock does not feel pain when it breaks.\nAccording to Shepherd: \u201cthe definition of matter is the\ncapacity of exhibiting upon a sentient nature, the sense of solid\nEXTENSION in general\u201d, and \u201cthat of mind, a capacity\nfitted to be excited to any sensation in particular\u201d (EPEU\n[2020: 242]). To be clear, solid extension is a sensation; its name is\ngiven also to the unknown powers of external objects that partly cause\nit (Shepherd (1832); EPEU [2020, 697]). Accordingly, matter is also\ndefined as the capacity for unperceived motion (EPEU [2020: 14\u201316]).\nOn Shepherd\u2019s theory, mind and matter do not have mutually\nincompatible absolute essences, as Descartes maintains; their absolute\n\u201creal essences\u201d are unknown (EPEU [2020: 242\u2013244]).\nNor is mind-body causal interaction a problem. If a mind and organized\nmatter form a union, each capacity realizes the other; a human being\nhas powers to feel, think, move and resist motion just as other kinds\nof objects are defined by a number of different powers (EPEU [2020:\n310\u2013311]). Within a human being, Shepherd explains, a conscious\nsensation of forming a plan and deciding to carry it out is united\nwith all the powers that co-exist with it, so the bodily part of the\nhuman being starts a motion which is guided by the conscious decision;\nthe cause of this motion must satisfy CSP, but the efficient cause of\nan effect is always unknown on her theory (EPEU [2020:\n403\u2013405]). See LoLordo (forthcoming) for further comparison of\nthis theory and mind-body substance dualism.)\n4.2 Selves\n\nAccording to Shepherd, we are individual capacities for sensation in\ngeneral (EPEU [2020: 14, 42)] who use \u201cI\u201d to refer to a\ncapacity external to all the sensations of which we are conscious\n(EPEU: 56\u20137). Although Boyle (2020: 105) is right that it seems\nreasonable that \u201cI\u201d refers to oneself, Shepherd wants to\nsay a self is a much more complex entity, an enduring object\nwith physical and psychological powers that mixes with other\nobjects with the result that various feelings, thoughts, bodily\nmotions, and mechanical interactions with external objects are\nregistered in it. A self comprises particular sensations including\nconsciousness of its continued existence, that is the feeling of the\ncontinued existence of its mind and its body. Consciousness of the\nformer is analyzed as, first, the sensation of the idea of the\ncontinually existing (partial) cause of sensations and, second, \nconsciousness of the power to remember previous sensations, i.e. the\nfeeling of the power to unite a present sensation with the idea of a\npast sensation (mass of qualities) and the passage of time (EPEU\n[2020: 98, 153\u2013154, 133). Consciousness of the continued\nexistence of the body is the sense of the extension of the body and\nits being sufficient to sustain the powers of life and consciousness,\n\u201cespecially those which determine the union of memory with sense\u201d\n(EPEU [2020: 153\u2013154). The upshot is that our belief that we can\nremember our previous mental states gives us the sense of our identity\nover time. Shepherd offers no account of personal identity as such,\nbut she concludes: \u201cidentity, therefore, has nothing to do with\nsameness of particles\u201d, or physical constituents of the self. It\nis not incorrect to say the sense of identity depends on the power of\nmemory, but more fundamentally, it depends on the eternality of an\nindividual human mind (compare LoLordo (forthcoming)).\n\nWhat happens to an individual mind when its present body dies? The\nindividual mind is immortal, but it is uncertain whether it will\nremain dormant, \u201clost in the eternal ocean of mind\u201d or\n\u201cretain its individual consciousness of personality\u201d (EPEU\n[2020: 378]), In the latter case, it may mix with some matter to form\nthe cause of new sensations and sustain the power to unite ideas of\nmemory with its present sensations or it may mix with some other sort\nof entity to produce sensations detached from memory; even now we use\nknowledge when we have forgotten how we got it (see LoLordo\n(forthcoming) for a more detailed discussion). Although Shepherd\nmentions analogies that make it probable that memory and personality\nwill be restored, she finds philosophy can go no further than that\n(EPEU [2020: 379\u201388]).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by Mary Shepherd", "Works by Other Authors"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by Mary Shepherd": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "[PWMS] 2000, <em>Philosophical Writings of Mary Shepherd</em>\n(facsimile reproductions), edited with Introduction by Jennifer\nMcRobert, 2 volumes, Bristol: Thoemmes Press.", "[ERCE] 1824, <em>An Essay upon the Relation of Cause and\nEffect</em>, London: T.
