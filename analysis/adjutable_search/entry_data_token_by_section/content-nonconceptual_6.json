    "main_text": "Applying the notion of nonconceptual content || Psychological explanation\n4.3 Psychological explanation\n\nIn explaining the behavior of nonlinguistic and prelinguistic\ncreatures cognitive ethologists and developmental psychologists often\nappeal to representational states. Spelke, for example, attempts to\nexplain the development of the ability to perceptually organize the\nvisual array into unitary, persisting objects by appeal to an\ninfant\u2019s capacity to form a representation of the visual surface\nlayout and the presence of mechanisms following basic principles of\ncohesion, boundedness, rigidity, and no action at a distance (Spelke\n1990). These capacities are claimed to explain the infant\u2019s\nrudimentary physical reasoning, underlying, for example, its ability\nto track the motion of particular objects and exhibit certain\nexpectancy responses regarding the persistence of objects behind\nocclusions (as exhibited, for example, in Baillargeon\u2019s (1987)\nfamous drawbridge experiment, in which an infant is habituated to see\na screen rotate 180\u00b0, and is dishabituated when the screen\n\u2018passes through\u2019 an object placed behind it. The\ndishabituation reflects the infant\u2019s expectation that the\nscreen\u2019s rotation will be blocked by the occluded object). Such\nresearch suggests that an explanation of the infant\u2019s behavior\nshould appeal to the way the infant is perceptually aware of the\nworld, as segmented into objects that exhibit certain predictable\nregularities.\n\nAccording to Spelke (1988), the content of those representations\nappealed to in explaining the infant\u2019s responses in tasks as\nthose mentioned above is conceptual content. The manifest behavior\nreflects the infant\u2019s incipient object concept and its capacity\nto utilize this concept in a primitive form of physical reasoning.\nHowever, if one has an account of what it is to possess a concept that\nmakes it inappropriate to attribute mastery of the corresponding\nconcept to the creature whose behavior is being explained, then the\nappeal to representations in the explanation of its behavior is also\nmotivation for the notion of nonconceptual representational\ncontent.\n\nOne such understanding stresses the relation between possessing\nconcepts and being able to justify certain canonical judgments\ninvolving that concept, going on to argue that providing\njustifications is a paradigmatically linguistic activity\u2014a\nmatter of identifying and articulating the reasons for a given\nclassification, inference or judgment (McDowell 1994a). If this is the\ncase, then nonlinguistic and prelinguistic creatures will not be able\nto possess concepts and those representations we attribute to them in\nexplaining their behavior will have to be nonconceptual. However,\nthere is a variety of possible responses to this argument. It might be\nobjected, for example, that possessing a given concept simply requires\nbeing able to make de facto justified judgments involving\nthat concept rather than being able to justify judgments involving\nthat concept. Or it might be objected that the ability to justify\njudgments involving some concept is not necessarily linguistic, since\nit is possible to identify the justification for a judgment without\nengaging in communication.\n\nHowever, the argument from the need to provide psychological\nexplanations of the behavior of nonhuman animals and human infants to\nthe existence of nonconceptual content does not stand or fall with the\nthesis that concepts are necessarily linguistic. It has been argued\nthat there is a distinction between two different types of thinking\n(Mithen 1996). Many students of the type of cognition engaged in by\nanimals and infants view it as being domain-specific and modular in\nimportant respects, best understood in terms of bodies of\n\u201cknowledge\u201d closely focused on particular aspects of the\nnatural and social worlds. An example of such domain-specificity is\nfound in the perceptual module Spelke suggests is responsible for the\nsegmentation of the visual array into objects according to certain\nbasic physical principles (Spelke 1990, 1994, Carey and Spelke 1996).\nThese domain-specific modules are thought to have evolved separately\nand for specific purposes and are not integrated with each other\n(Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994). In contrast, many philosophers have\nsuggested that the type of conceptual thought engaged in by\nlanguage-users is essentially domain-general, systematic and\nproductive. Concept-possessors can generate an indefinite number of\nnew thoughts from the concepts they possess and their thoughts obey\nwhat Evans (1982) has termed the generality constraint. As Evans says,\n\u201cWe cannot avoid thinking of a thought about an individual\nobject x, to the effect that it is F, as the\nexercise of two separable capacities; one being the capacity to think\nof x, which could be equally exercised in thoughts about\nx to the effect that it is G or H; and the\nother being a conception of what it is to be F, which could\nbe equally exercised in thoughts about other individuals, to the\neffect that they are F\u201d (Evans 1982, p. 75).\n\nIf the generality constraint is taken to be an essential\ncharacteristic of conceptual thought (as it is by Evans 1982, Peacocke\n1992, and Heck 2007, for example) then it seems to follow that many\n(if not all) non-linguistic creatures are not capable of engaging in\nconceptual thought. For illustration we can look again at\ninfants\u2019 object perception. Though the infant is capable of\nrepresenting its environment in a particular way that explains its\nexpectations regarding object motion and object persistence, the fact\nthat such representations are domain-specific suggests that this\ncharacteristic of conceptual thought is violated. In particular, the\ndomain-specificity of this type of cognition makes it the case that\ncapacities operative in constructing object representations are not\nones that can be engaged generally in contexts falling beyond the\ndomain of operation of the module. Thus, we have a violation of the\ngenerality constraint with respect to these representations. This\nsuggests that the kinds of capacities that are involved in the\ninfant\u2019s representation of the environment are not conceptual.\nSo, if they are correctly described as representing the world at all,\ntheir representations must be nonconceptual. See also the discussion\nof analog magnitude representations in Beck (2012).\n\nOf course, the plausibility of this way of motivating the notion of\nnonconceptual content is a hostage to fortune in two important senses,\none empirical and one philosophical. The argument rests upon an\nempirical claim about the appropriate way to explain the behavior of\nnon-linguistic and pre-linguistic creatures\u2014and in particular\nupon the assumption that it will not turn out to be possible to\nexplain such behavior in non-psychological terms. But the argument\nalso depends upon the thesis that the domain of behavior explicable in\npsychological terms extends further than the domain of concept\npossession\u2014and this in turn depends upon a substantive\nphilosophical account of what it is to possess a concept. If, for\nexample, possessing the concept of an F simply requires being able to\ndiscriminate Fs from the rest of the perceptual environment and/or to\nact on them in a suitable manner, then it is hard to see how any\nevidence that animals and young infants represent the world will not\nalso be evidence that they represent the world conceptually.\n",
