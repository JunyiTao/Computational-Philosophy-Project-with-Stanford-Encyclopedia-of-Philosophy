After espousing skepticism\nhimself, he became a dogmatist. He defended an epistemological theory\nessentially the same as the Stoics\u2019 and an ethical theory which\nsynthesized elements from the Stoa and Plato and Aristotle. In both\nareas he claimed to be reviving the doctrines of the Old Academy of\nPlato and his earliest successors and\nAristotle.\n\n",
