    "main_text": "Deceptionism vs. Non-Deceptionism About Lying || Moral Deceptionism\n2.3 Moral Deceptionism\n\n\nMoral Deceptionists hold that in addition to making an untruthful\nstatement with an intention to deceive, lying requires the violation\nof a moral right of another, or the moral wronging of another.\n\n\nAccording to Chisholm and Feehan, every lie is a violation of the\nright of a hearer, since \u201cIt is assumed that, if a\nperson x asserts a proposition p to another\nperson y, then y has the right to expect\nthat x himself believes p. And it is assumed\nthat x knows, or at least that he ought to know, that, if he\nasserts p to y, while believing himself\nthat p is not true, then he violates this right\nof y\u2019s\u201d (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 153,\n[variables have been changed for uniformity]). Nevertheless, it is not\npart of their definition of lying that lying involves the violation of\nthe right of another person.  According to most philosophers, the\nclaim that lying is (either defeasibly or non-defeasibly) morally wrong is\n\u201ca synthetic judgment and not an analytic one\u201d (Kemp and\nSullivan 1993, 153). However, \u2018lie\u2019 is considered by some\nphilosophers to be a thick ethical term that it both describes a type\nof action and morally evaluates that type of action negatively\n(Williams 1985, 140). For some philosophers, \u201cthe wrongfulness\nof lying is\u2026 built into the definition of the term\u201d (Kemp\nand Sullivan 1993, 153). For these philosophers, the claim that lying\nis (either defeasibly or non-defeasibly) morally wrong is a tautology\n(Margolis 1962).\n\n\nAccording to Hugo Grotius, it is part of the meaning of\n\u2018lie\u2019 when it is \u201cstrictly taken\u201d that it\ninvolves \u201cthe Violation of a Real right\u201d of the person lied\nto, namely, \u201cthe Freedom of him\u2026 to judge\u201d (Grotius\n2005, 1212). One can only lie to someone who possesses this\nright to exercise liberty of judgment. Grotius\u2019s definition of lying\nis therefore as follows (modified accordingly):\n\n(L10)\nTo lie =df to make a believed-false statement to\nanother person, with the intention that that other person believe that\nstatement to be true (or believe that the statement is believed to be\ntrue, or both), violating that person\u2019s right to exercise liberty\nof judgment. (Grotius 2005)\n\n\n\nAccording to L10, one cannot lie to \u201cChildren or\nMadmen,\u201d for example, since they lack the right of liberty of\njudgment (Grotius 2005, 1212). One cannot lie to someone who has given\n\u201cexpress Consent\u201d to be told untruths, since he has given\nup the right to exercise his liberty of judgment about these matters\n(Grotius 2005, 1214). One cannot lie to someone who by \u201ctacit\nConsent\u201d or presumed consent \u201cfounded upon just\nReason\u201d has given up the right to exercise his liberty of\njudgment about some matter, \u201con account of the Advantage, that he\nshall get by it,\u201d such as when \u201ca Person\u2026 comforts\nhis sick Friend, by making him believe what is false,\u201d since\n\u201cno Wrong is done to him that is willing\u201d (Grotius\n2005, 1215\u20131217). Furthermore, \u201che who has an absolute Right over\nall the Rights of another,\u201d is not lying when he \u201cmakes use\nof that Right, in telling something false, either for his particular\nAdvantage, or for the publick Good\u201d (Grotius 2005, 1216\u20131218).\nThe right to exercise one\u2019s liberty of judgment can also be taken\naway in cases \u201cWhen the life of an innocent Person, or something\nequal to it,\u201d is at stake, or when \u201cthe Execution of a\ndishonest Act be otherwise prevented\u201d (Grotius 2005, 1221). In\nsuch a case, the person has forfeited his right, and\n\u201cspeaking falsely to those\u2014like thieves\u2014to whom\ntruthfulness is not owed cannot be called lying\u201d (Bok 1978,\n14).\n\n\nAlan Donagan also incorporates moral conditions into his definition\nof lying (modified to include cases in which speakers only intend to\ndeceive about their beliefs):\n\n(L11)\nTo lie =df to freely make a believed-false statement\nto another fully responsible and rational person, with the intention\nthat that other person believe that statement to be true [or the\nintention that that other person believe that that statement is\nbelieved to be true, or both]. (Donagan 1977)\n\n\n\nAccording to L11, it is not possible to lie to \u201cchildren,\nmadmen, or those whose minds have been impaired by age or\nillness\u201d (Donagan 1977, 89), since they are not fully responsible\nand rational persons. It is also not possible to lie to \u201ca\nwould-be murderer who threatens your life if you will not tell him\nwhere his quarry has gone\u201d (Donagan 1977, 89), and in general\nwhen you are acting under duress in any way (such as a witness in fear\nof his life on the witness stand, or a victim being robbed by a thief),\nsince statements made in such circumstances are not freely made.\n \n\n\nIt has been objected that these moral deceptionist definitions are\nunduly narrow and restrictive (Bok 1978). Surely, for example, it is\npossible to lie to a would-be murderer, whether it is impermissible, as\nsome absolutist deontologists maintain (Augustine 1952; Aquinas 1972\n(cf.  MacIntyre 1995b); Kant 1996 (cf. Mahon 2006); Newman 1880; Geach\n1977; Betz 1985; Pruss 1999; Tollefsen 2014), or permissible (i.e.,\neither optional or obligatory), as consequentialists and moderate\ndeontologists maintain (Constant 1964; Mill 1863; Sidgwick 1981; Bok\n1978; MacIntyre 1995a; cf. Kagan 1998).\n\n\nIt has also been objected that these moral deceptionist definitions\nare morally lax (Kemp and Sullivan 1993, 158\u20139). By rendering certain\ndeceptive untruthful statements to others as non-lies, they\nmake it permissible to act in a way that would otherwise be open to\nmoral censure. In general, even those philosophers who hold that all\nlies have an inherent negative weight, albeit such that it can be\noverridden, and hence, who hold that lying is defeasibly morally wrong,\ndo not incorporate moral necessary conditions into their definitions of\nlying (Bok 1978; Kupfer 1982; cf. Wiles 1988).\n",
