Theories, models, and explanations\n\nThe coexistence of heterogeneous representations (including theories,\nmodels, and explanations) is ubiquitous in scientific practice.\nDifferent branches of science offer different theories and laws,\nraising questions about the nature of the (e.g., reductive and\nnon-reductive) relationships between them. Within a discipline,\nheterogeneous models or explanations of the same phenomenon may also\nco-exist. Such cases of representational plurality are now\nwell-documented in various scientific fields. In nuclear physics, for\nexample, several models of an atomic nucleus are available and the\nsame goes for fluid mechanics, which offers various types of\nmodelisation of turbulent flows (Morrison 2011); in economics, a\nmultiplicity of models exist side by side as a base for policy\ndecisions (Rodrik 2015); in climate science, the use of multiple\nsimulation models is a common strategy (Parker 2006; Edwards 2010);\nbehavioral biology offers many examples of co-existence of multiple\nexplanations (Mitchell 2003; Longino 2013; Muszynski & Malaterre\n2020). Various pluralist frameworks have been developed to address\nsuch cases of plurality, which amount to different views both on the\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre of these situations and on the\nappropriate epistemic attitudes towards them.\n",
