    "main_text": "Perceptual Phenomena || Successful Perception\n2.2 Successful Perception\n\nSome epistemologists privilege perceptual states that you are in only\nif you are not in cases of illusion or hallucination. On their views,\nthese states are either the only sources of perceptual justification,\nor at any rate the best sources of perceptual justification. In the\nterminology of Hawthorne and Kovakovich 2006, we may call these\nperceptual states \u201csuccess states\u201d.\n\nTo get a sense of some of the candidate states, consider the following\ntable:\n\n\n\n\n \n(Successful)\u00a0vision\nIllusion\nHallucination\n\n\n\n\nHaving a visual experience with the content that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\nY \nY \nY \n\n\nSeeing \\(a\\) as being \\(F\\)\nY \nY \nN \n\n\nSeeing that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\nY \nN \nN \n\n\nSeeing \\(a\\)\u2019s \\(F\\)ness\nY \nN \nN \n\n\n\n\n(In setting up this table, we assume that hallucinations of a\nparticular object are possible. For discussion, see Johnston 2004 or\nSchellenberg 2010.)\n\n\nEpistemologists differ according to which success states they\nprivilege, what job they assign to the state, and how severely they\nregard the absence of the privileged state.\n\nFor views which privilege seeing that \\(p\\), see\nMcDowell (1982, 1995) or A. Jackson (2011). For views which privilege\nsomething along the lines of\nseeing \\(a\\)\u2019s \\(F\\)ness, see\nJohnston (2006). These states are\nfact-entailing, since as a matter of necessity, you see that\n\\(a\\) is \\(F\\), or\nsee \\(a\\)\u2019s\n\\(F\\)ness, only if \\(a\\)\nis in fact \\(F\\). For a view that\npotentially favors the sort of perceptual state you find in cases of\nvision and illusion rather than hallucination, see Burge (2003). This\nsort of state is relational, since you can be in it only if\nthe relevant object of perception is present in your scene. Assuming\nthat each conscious success state has a counterpart in unconscious\nperception, notice that versions of these views might focus on\nperceptual states in common between conscious subjects and subjects\nwithout conscious perception.\n\nIn principle, you might get perceptual justification from a success\nstate in the good case of vision or illusion, and get the same amount\nof perceptual justification from a non-success state in the bad case\nof hallucination (Lord forthcoming takes up a view with this structure\nregarding reasons for belief). We bracket that sort of approach here.\nIt is more common to hold that you get no perceptual justification in\nthe case of hallucination (e.g., Jackson 2011), or at least a lower\ndegree or different kind of perceptual justification in the case of\nhallucination (e.g., Schellenberg 2013).\n\nLet\u2019s group views that privilege success states under the label\n\u201cSuccess Theory\u201d, and leave open how to adjudicate within\nthe camp.\n\nIn support of Success Theory, one can emphasize the tight connection\nthe approach draws between perceptual justification and truth. On many\nversions of the approach, the state that gives you justification to\nbelieve that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\) guarantees\nthe truth of the belief that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\).\nMoreover, the source of your justification remains\nmental and arguably accessible to you, thus satisfying the demands of\nsome \u201cinternalist\u201d approaches in epistemology that\nprivilege what is inside the subject or accessible in a special way by\nthe subject (Prichard 2012). Moreover, Success Theory has a promising\nconnection with issues about skepticism. They promise to block\nskeptical arguments that assume our evidence is the same between the\ngood case of successful vision and the bad case of radical deception\nor hallucination (McDowell 1995, for a critique, see Wright 2004).\n\nAs an objection to Success Theory, many bring in demands on\njustification that are not satisfied by the most versions of the view.\nFor instance, consider the internalist thesis that, if things seem the\nsame to each of two people from the inside, then those two people are\nequally justified in their beliefs. More specifically, if two people\nhave the same conscious perspective on the world, and the same stored\nbeliefs, then they are the same with respect to the degree of\njustification of their beliefs. This sort of thesis is often motivated\nby considering radically deceived counterparts to us, and appealing to\nthe intuition that such subjects and us are equally justified (Lehrer\nand Cohen 1983; Cohen 1984; Wedgwood 2002; for dispute, see Sutton\n2007 or Littlejohn 2012). Now, if a version of Success Theory predicts\nthat a subject in perceptual error has less justification than a\ncorresponding perceiver, that version might be rejected on the basis\nof its conflict with the internalist thesis.\n\nIn response, one might attempt to explain away the intuition of equal\njustification as instead concerning equal blamelessness or\nexcusability, or at any rate as being correct only if restricted to\nblamelessness or excusability (e.g. Williamson 2007 or forthcoming).\nCritics often try to respond by distinguishing the sort of\nblamelessness or excusability one finds in cases of cognitive delusion\nor brainwashing, from the epistemic status of the beliefs of the\nvictim of an evil demon (Pryor 2001), or by demanding a more thorough\nexplanation of why the victim is indeed blameless or excusable\n(Miracchi forthcoming). Recent literature also steps back to examine\nwhether a substantive distinction can be drawn between justification\nand excusability, surveying potential distinctive explanatory roles\nfor epistemic excuses to play (Greco 2019).\n\nAlternatively, someone with a \u201cdisjunctive theory of\nperception\u201d might insist that the radically deceived subject\ndoes not have the same conscious perspective on the world as the\nsuccessful perceiver (Fish 2013, also the entry on\n the disjunctive theory of perception).\n On this line of thought, to have the conscious perspective of someone\nin a case of perceptual success, you need to be in a case of\nperceptual success. Here the antecedent of the internalist thesis is\nnot satisfied in cases of radical deception. One challenge here is\nthat there are many ways to be deceived. For example, when someone\nsees that a lemon is yellow, they might well lack a conscious\ncounterpart who hallucinates, but they arguably still have a conscious\ncounterpart who sees a fake lemon that is yellow. If the subject in a\ncase of vision and the subject in a case of illusion are equally\njustified, that will be trouble for approaches that give justifying\nprivilege to the states of seeing that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\nor seeing \\(a\\)\u2019s \\(F\\)ness.\n\nSome philosophers might attack Success Theory on the grounds that it\nis too internalist rather than not internalist enough. According to\ntheorists such as Ginsborg 2006 or Roessler 2009, the justifiers of\nperceptual beliefs are best understood to be facts about the external\nworld rather than facts about perceivers\u2019 mind.\n",
