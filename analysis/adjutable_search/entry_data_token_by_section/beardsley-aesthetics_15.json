    "main_text": "Back to Literary Discourse\n16. The Internal and the External\n\nBroader than concerns about the artist\u2019s intention and\nencompassing them is the distinction between external and internal\nevidence. The distinction is similar to, but diverges from, that\nbetween direct and indirect evident noted above. \u201cInternal\nevidence\u201d, Beardsley says, \u201cis evidence from direct\ninspection of the object\u201d (Aesth: 20). What is internal\nis publicly accessible;\n\n\nit is discovered [in the case of poetry] through the semantics and\nsyntax of a poem, through our habitual knowledge of the language\nthrough grammars, dictionaries, and all the literature which is the\nsource of dictionaries, in general through all that makes a language\nand culture. (IF: 477)\n\n\n\u201cExternal evidence\u201d, on the other hand,\n\n\nis evidence from the psychological and social background of the\nobject, from which we may infer something about the object itself.\n(Aesth: 20)\n\n\nWhat is external is not publicly accessible; it is\n\n\nprivate or idiosyncratic; not [again in the case of poetry] a part of\nthe work as a linguistic fact: it consists of revelations (in\njournals, for example, or letters or recorded conversations) about how\nor why the poet wrote the poem\u2014to what lady, while sitting on\nwhat lawn, or at the death of a friend or brother. (IF:\n477\u2013478)\n\n\nIn addition to internal and external evidence, there is\n\n\nan intermediate kind of evidence about the character of the author or\nabout private or semi-private meanings attached to words or topics by\nthe author or by a coterie of which he is a member. (IF: 478)\n\n\nExternal evidence is verboten, but at least at the time of \u201cThe\nIntentional Fallacy\u201d, intermediate evidence was admissible, the\nreason being that\n\n\nthe meaning of words is the history of words, and the biography of an\nauthor, his use of a word, and the associations the word had for\nhim, are part of the word\u2019s history and meaning. (IF:\n478)\n\n\nCaution has to be exercised, though, for the line between intermediate\nevidence and external evidence isn\u2019t sharp\u00a0and\n\n\na critic who is concerned with [internal] evidence\u2026 and\nmoderately with [intermediate] evidence will in the long run produce a\ndifferent sort of comment from that of the critic who is concerned\nwith [external] evidence and with [intermediate] evidence. (IF:\n478)\n\n\nThe distinction thus drawn is far from clear, though. On the one hand,\ninformation gleaned from a poet\u2019s diary, workbook, letters, and\nrough drafts, or information about what he was reading or thinking\nabout as he created his work, isn\u2019t internal evidence in that it\ncan\u2019t be had from directly inspecting his poem. On the other\nhand, it does seem to be internal, in that such information is\npublicly accessible, and might well be part of \u201call that makes a\nlanguage and culture\u201d. Resolving that tension is only part of\nthe issue, however. \u201cThe character of the author\u201d or the\n\u201cprivate or semi-private meanings attached to words or topics by\nthe author or by a coterie of which he is a member\u201d might be\nrevealed in a diary or workbook, and part of a \u201cword\u2019s\nhistory and meaning\u201d might be recorded in a letter. That makes\nit sound like intermediate evidence. More than anything else, though,\nwhat a diary or a workbook contains is \u201cevidence [respecting]\nthe psychological and social background\u201d of a work, and such\ninformation is no different from \u201crevelations\u2026 in\njournals\u2026 or letters\u201d. It would thus seem to be external\nevidence, as Beardsley talks about it. Is the information found in\ndiaries, journals, workbooks, rough drafts, letters, and so on\ninternal, external, or intermediate evidence, then? All three, it\nwould seem.\n\nThough the distinction between kinds of evidence isn\u2019t well\ndrawn by Beardsley, that may be because when he wrote \u201cThe\nIntentional Fallacy\u201d his views weren\u2019t as clear or\ndefinite as they were later to become, or because he later changed his\nmind and became more tough-minded. Intermediate evidence is never\nmentioned in Aesthetics or in any of his subsequent writings,\nand if the distinction between internal and external evidence is\nconsidered only as it\u2019s drawn in Aesthetics, it\u2019s\nrelatively clean: internal evidence is evidence based on a direct\ninspection of the aesthetic object and nothing else; external evidence\nis evidence based on sources outside the object. That at least seems\nto draw a fairly bright line between the internal and the external.\nUnfortunately, drawing the distinction this way re-introduces the\nproblems about not using external sources noted above in relation to\nthe intentional fallacy.\n\nAll of that said, the feeling remains that there has to be something\nto the internal/external distinction, even if it isn\u2019t\nexplicated in a satisfactory way by Beardsley. Intuitively, some\nproperties are properties of a work, and some properties aren\u2019t\nproperties of a work. Related to this is what\u2019s really at issue,\nthe matter of proper methodology, or the epistemology of\ninterpretation: some evidence is relevant to what a work\nmeans\u2014and what else but properties of the work itself?\u2014and\nsome evidence isn\u2019t logically relevant to what a work\nmeans\u2014and what else but properties of things other than the\nwork? Put this way, the distinction seems inevitable, and indeed,\nit\u2019s hard to see how art criticism can get along without it.\nRejecting it altogether is tantamount to inviting \u201cchaos of\nthought and passion, all confused\u201d\u2014in other words, the\npotential relevance of anything and everything to interpretation, and\nthus no limits on what a work of art can justifiably be said to mean.\nDeconstructionists may well welcome such unlimited freedom, but lesser\nbreeds who like the law\u2014which includes historicist, romantic,\npsychoanalytic, and other critics, besides new critics\u2014will\nwonder whether the very idea of interpretation has been lost in the\nmidst of anarchy.\n\nBut even if an internal/external distinction of some sort is well-nigh\nnecessary, it\u2019s probably best not to couch it in exactly those\nterms. The real issue isn\u2019t so much what\u2019s in and\nwhat\u2019s out as what\u2019s relevant and what\u2019s not.\nBeardsley\u2019s terminology not only obscures that fact\u00a0but\nskews the true substantive issue: strongly suggested by the very use\nof the terms \u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d is that\nrelevant information is internal to a work, that is, propositions\nwhose subject terms refer to the work or part of the work and whose\npredicate terms refer to properties discernible by experiencing the\nwork; and irrelevant information is external to a work, that is,\npropositions whose subject terms refer to something other than the\nwork or part of the work, or to properties not discernible by\nexperiencing the work.\n\nIn the long run, the distinction will have to be drawn, just as the\nissue of the intentional fallacy will have to be decided, on the basis\nof a comprehensive theory of meaning in conjunction with a rich and\nwell-worked-out conception of art.\n",
