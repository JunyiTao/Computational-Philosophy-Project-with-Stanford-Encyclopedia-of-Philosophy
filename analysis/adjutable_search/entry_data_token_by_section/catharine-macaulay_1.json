Republican Liberty and The History of England\n\nAlthough Macaulay did not write explicitly about the nature of freedom\nuntil quite late in life, her histories should be read as a\ncontribution to the theory of republican liberty, though not quite as\nthat idea has been outlined by Quentin Skinner and Philip Pettit\n(Skinner 1998, 2008; Pettit 1997). Skinner argues that, as a result of\nhis intention of refuting the political doctrines which lay behind the\nEnglish Civil War, Thomas Hobbes made innovations in the concept of\nfreedom of the will, and introduced the idea that one acts freely\nwhenever one\u2019s act is caused by one\u2019s own deliberations, and is not\nimpeded by some external constraint. Thus Hobbes simultaneously\nsupported the metaphysical view, according to which freedom and causal\ndeterminism are compatible, and introduced the political concept of\nnegative liberty, thought of as freedom from external constraint. He\noverthrew the then dominant metaphysical concept of human\nfreedom\u2014which had descended from Plato via the later Stoics,\nSeneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius\u2014according to which we are\nunfree when our acts are caused by the passions, and free only when we\nact according to reason, as well as the view that political freedom\ninvolves freedom from arbitrary domination.\n\nHowever, the concept of freedom as rational self-government did not disappear, John Locke, in his Two Treatises\nConcerning Government, accepted that we are\npolitically free only when governed by a rational law. He argued that\nthe reason why a man only attains to the status of a freeman at the\nage of maturity is that to be free is to be guided by reason (Locke\n1689[1967]). Thus political freedom corresponds to being governed by a\nrational law, which is the law of nature. However, Locke undermined\nthe epistemological basis of his political principles, which require\nthat there is a moral \u201claw of nature\u201d discoverable by\nreason, when he insisted, as part of his empiricism, that there is no\ninnate knowledge of principles. While Locke himself thought that\nreason could discover the rational validity of the law of nature, by\nreflecting on ideas that we have acquired through sensation and\nreflection, only a few subsequent writers were convinced by his\nreasoning. Some, such as Shaftesbury and Hutcheson reintroduced a form\nof innate knowledge, which nevertheless seemed respectably empirical,\nby developing the idea of a moral sense. Another anonymous \u201cRemarker\u201d, whose identity is unclear,\nargued that the closest that an empiricist such as Locke could get to\na moral doctrine was a form of Epicureanism, which would reduce\nmorality to enlightened self-interest (Burnet 1989; Walmsley 2016). Hume, following\nthe logic of empiricism, would come to essentially the same\nconclusion, without seeing this as problematic. The Remarker\u2019s critique of\nLocke was answered by Catharine Trotter Cockburn, whose attempt to\ndefend Locke was praised by him, but not ultimately fully worked out.\nNevertheless, the position that Cockburn developed in later works has\nsome similarities with that which Macaulay defends (Cockburn 1702;\nGreen 2014, 34\u201339, 172\u201379). According to Macaulay, there\nis an immutable moral truth that can be discovered by reason, and as\nCockburn will come to do, she uses the concept of\n\u201cfitness\u201d to explain this process of discovery. Macaulay\u2019s\nlanguage is also very close to Samuel Clarke\u2019s. But, while Cockburn\nwas directly influenced by Clarke (Bolton 1996; Sheridan 2007),\nMacaulay claims that she did not read his works until after she had\ncompleted her Treatise (Macaulay 1783, viii). She proposes\nthat there is a rule of eternal right grounded in,\n\n\n\u2026 a necessary and essential difference of things, a fitness and\nunfitness, a proportion and disproportion, a moral beauty and a moral\ndeformity, an immutable right and wrong, necessary independent of the\nwill of every being created or uncreated, explained by the philosopher\nPlato under the form of everlasting intellectual ideas, or moral\nentities, coeval with eternity, and residing in the divine mind; from\nwhence, by irradiating rays, like the emitting of the sun-beams, they\nenlighten the understanding of all those intellectual beings, who,\ndisregarding the objects of sense, give themselves up to the\ncontemplation of the Deity; whilst modern philosophers, in a lower\nstrain of reasoning, assert an abstract fitness of things perceived by\nthe mind of God, and so interwoven in the nature of contemplative\nobjects, as to be traced like other abstract truths, by those\nfaculties of the mind which enable us to compare and perceive the\nagreement and disagreement of our sensitive and reflex ideas.\n(Macaulay 1783, 30\u20132)\n\n\nThus, a free people will be governed by a law that is not arbitrary,\nbut rather corresponds to what is fit, and is able to be apprehended\nby reason. Her history is an account of the struggle of the English\npeople to maintain their freedom in this sense, against the\npretensions of Stuart absolutism and the imposition of arbitrary\nsway.\n",
