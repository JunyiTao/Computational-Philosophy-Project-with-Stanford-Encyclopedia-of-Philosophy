    "main_text": "The Problem\n2. The Problem\n\nThe core question underlying the existence of these two competing\nphilosophical traditions is the extent to which something is formed or\norganized from \u201cthe beginning\u201d or whether organization and\nform arise only over time. Nineteenth-century uses of the term\n\u201cevolution\u201d included a sense of unfolding of preexisting\nform, a sort of preformationism in contrast to the epigenesis of the\nday. Discussions of \u201cevolution\u201d and\n\u201cepigenesis\u201d can therefore be misleading in retrospect\nsince the former term has assumed a meaning closer to the older\nmeaning of epigenesis (Bowler 1975). Making things even more\ncomplicated, by the late nineteenth century\n\u201cpreformationism\u201d really was more about various versions\nof predetermination or predelineation than preexistence of form as\nsuch. Furthermore some authors saw epigenesis or preformation as\nentirely internally directed, while others in each case allowed\nresponses to the environment. In the background lie debates about the\nrelative significance of predestination and free will, for persons,\nfor organic beings, or even for the inorganic. In each case, it is\nimportant to keep in mind what the particular writer was saying and\nthe arguments presented. Thus, discussions of epigenesis and\npreformation often bring in other ancillary questions and are\ndifficult to separate from their contexts. This entry is an effort to\nextract what is centrally at issue and to focus on key contributions\nto the discussion.\n\nThe terms of debate can in principle apply to the inorganic world;\ne.g., solar systems can \u201cevolve\u201d and could develop\nepigenetically. Yet they are not thought of as doing so, typically,\nand so epigenesis and preformation are primarily applied to the\norganic world. Species can evolve or develop more or less gradually,\nwith more or less form already physically existing or programmed in\nfrom the beginning. Yet typically discussions of epigenesis and\npreformation have focused on individual organisms and their\ndevelopment rather than on species. The emphasis is on different\ninterpretations of the actual developmental process as it plays out in\ntime, in individual organisms. Therefore, this entry focuses on\nindividual organisms and understandings of their development\nprocesses. Even more specifically, this means looking at the\ndevelopment of their form and to a lesser extent also function.\nEpigenesis and preformation offer two competing interpretations of\nwhat is involved, with a range of alternatives in between. The two\napproaches draw on different metaphysical and different\nepistemological sets of assumptions. We can get at the central issues\nby looking most closely at a series of focused episodes.\n",
