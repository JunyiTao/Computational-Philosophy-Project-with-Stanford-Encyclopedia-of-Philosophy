Problems Concerning Scientific Representation\n\nIn most general terms, any representation that is the product of a\nscientific endeavour is a scientific representation. These\nrepresentations are a heterogeneous group comprising anything from\nthermometer readings and flow charts to verbal descriptions,\nphotographs, X-ray pictures, digital imagery, equations, models, and\ntheories. How do these representations work?\n\nThe first thing that strikes the novice in the debate about scientific\nrepresentation is that there seems to be little agreement about what\nthe problem is. Different authors frame the problem of scientific\nrepresentation in different ways, and eventually they examine\ndifferent issues. So a discussion of scientific representation has to\nbegin with a clarification of the problem itself. Reviewing the\nliterature on the subject leads us to the conclusion that there is no\nsuch thing as the problem of scientific\nrepresentation\u2014in fact, there are at least five different\nproblems concerning scientific representation (Frigg and Nguyen 2020:\nch. 1). In this section we formulate these problems and articulate\nfive conditions of adequacy that every account of scientific\nrepresentation has to satisfy.\n\nThe first problem is: what turns something into a scientific\nrepresentation of something else? It has become customary to phrase\nthis problem in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions and ask:\nwhat fills the blank in \u201c\\(S\\) is a scientific representation of\n\\(T\\) iff ___\u201d, where \u201c\\(S\\)\u201d stands for the object\ndoing the representing and \u201c\\(T\\)\u201d for \u201ctarget\nsystem\u201d, the part or aspect of the world the representation is\n about?[1]\n Let us call this the Scientific Representation Problem (or\nSR-Problem for short).\n\nA number of contributors to the debate have emphasised that scientific\nrepresentation is an intentional concept, depending on factors such as\na user\u2019s intentions, purposes and objectives, contextual\nstandards of accuracy, intended audiences, and community practices\n(see, for instance, Boesch 2017; Giere 2010; M\u00e4ki 2011;\nSu\u00e1rez 2004; and van Fraassen 2008). We will discuss these in\ndetail below. At this point it needs to be emphasised that framing the\nproblem in terms of a biconditional does not preclude such factors to\nbe part of the analysis. The blank can be filled with a \\((n+2)\\)-ary\nrelation \\(C(S, T, x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\\) (\\(C\\) for\n\u201cconstitutes\u201d), where \\(n \\ge 0\\) is a natural number and\nthe \\(x_i\\) are factors such as intentions and purposes.\n\nA first important condition of adequacy on any reply to this problem\nis that scientific representations allow us to form hypotheses about\ntheir target systems. An X-ray picture provides information about the\nbones of the patient, and models allow investigators to discover\nfeatures of the things models stands for. Every acceptable theory of\nscientific representation has to account for how reasoning conducted\non representations can yield claims about their target systems. Swoyer\n(1991: 449) refers to this kind of representation-based thinking as\n\u201csurrogative reasoning\u201d and so we call this the\nSurrogative Reasoning\n Condition.[2]\n This condition distinguishes models from lexicographical and\nindexical representations, which do not allow for surrogative\nreasoning.\n\nUnfortunately this condition does not constrain answers sufficiently\nbecause any account of representation that fills the blank in a way\nthat satisfies the surrogative reasoning condition will almost\ninvariably also cover other kinds of representations. Speed camera\nphotographs give the police information about drivers breaking the\nlaw, a cardboard model of the palace instructs us about its layout and\nproportions, and a weather map shows you where to expect rain. These\nrepresentations are therefore are likely to fall under an account of\nrepresentation that explains surrogative reasoning. Hence,\nrepresentations other than scientific representations also allow for\nsurrogative reasoning, which raises the question: how do scientific\nrepresentations differ from other kinds of representations that allow\nfor surrogative reasoning? Callender and Cohen (2006: 68\u201369)\npoint out that this is a version Popper\u2019s demarcation problem,\nnow phrased in terms of representation, and so we refer to it as the\nRepresentational Demarcation Problem.\n\nCallender and Cohen voice scepticism about there being a solution to\nthis problem and suggest that the distinction between scientific and\nnon-scientific representations is circumstantial (2006: 83):\nscientific representations are representations that are used or\ndeveloped by someone who is a scientist. Other authors do not\nexplicitly discuss the representational demarcation problem, but\nstances similar to Callender and Cohen\u2019s are implicit in any\napproach that analyses scientific representation alongside other kinds\nof representation. Elgin (2010), French (2003), Frigg (2006), Hughes\n(1997), Su\u00e1rez (2004), and van Fraassen (2008), for instance,\nall draw parallels between scientific and pictorial representation,\nwhich would make little sense if pictorial and scientific\nrepresentation were categorically different.\n\nThose who reject the notion that there is an essential difference\nbetween scientific and non-scientific representation can follow a\nsuggestion of Contessa\u2019s (2007) and broaden the scope of the\ninvestigation. Rather than analysing scientific representation, they\ncan analyse the broader category of epistemic representation.\nThis category comprises scientific representations, but it also\nincludes other representations that allow for surrogative reasoning.\nThe task then becomes to fill the blank in \u201c\\(S\\) is an\nepistemic representation of \\(T\\) iff ___\u201d. We call this the\nEpistemic Representation Problem (ER-Problem, for\nshort), and the biconditional the ER-Scheme. So one can say\nthat the ER-Problem is to fill the blank in the ER-Scheme.\n\nNot all representations are of the same kind, not even if we restrict\nour attention to scientific representations (assuming they are found\nto be relevantly different to non-scientific epistemic\nrepresentations). An X-ray photograph represents an ankle joint in a\ndifferent way than a biomechanical model, a mercury thermometer\nrepresent the temperature of gas in a different way than statistical\nmechanics does, and chemical theory represents a C60 fullerene in\ndifferent way that an electron-microscope image of the molecule. Even\nwhen restricting attention to the same kind of representation, there\nare important differences: Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s liquid drop model,\nfor instance, represents the nucleus of an atom in a manner that seems\nto be different from the one of the shell model, and an electric\ncircuit model represents the brain function in a different way than a\nneural network model. In brief, there seem to be different\nrepresentational styles. This raises the question: what styles are\nthere and how can they be\n characterised?[3]\n We call this the Problem of\n Style.[4]\n There is no expectation that a complete list of styles be\nprovided in response. Indeed, it is unlikely that such a list can ever\nbe drawn up, and new styles will be invented as science progresses.\nFor this reason a response to the problem of style will always be\nopen-ended, providing a taxonomy of what is currently available while\nleaving room for later additions.\n\nSome representations are accurate; others aren\u2019t. The quantum\nmechanical model is an accurate representation of the atom (at least\nby our current lights) but the Thomson model isn\u2019t. On what\ngrounds do we make such judgments? Morrison (2008: 70) reminds us that\nit is a task for theory of representation to identify what constitutes\nan accurate representation. We call this the problem of Standards\nof Accuracy. Providing such standards is one of the issues an\naccount of representation has to address, which, however, is not to\nsay that accurate representation is the sole epistemic virtue of\nscientific models. As Parker (2020) points out, there are numerous of\nconsiderations to take into account when evaluating a model\u2019s\nadequacy for its purpose, see Downes (2021: ch. 5) for further\ndiscussion.\n\nThis problem goes hand in hand with a condition of adequacy: the\nPossibility of Misrepresentation. Asking what makes a\nrepresentation an accurate representation ipso facto\npresupposes that inaccurate representations are representations too.\nAnd this is how it should be. If \\(S\\) does not accurately represent\n\\(T\\), then it is a misrepresentation but not a non-representation. It\nis therefore a general constraint on a theory of scientific\nrepresentation that it has to make misrepresentation\n possible.[5]\n\nA related condition concerns models that misrepresent in the sense\nthat they lack target systems. Models of the ether, phlogiston,\nfour-sex populations, and so on, are all deemed scientific models, but\nether, phlogiston, and four-sex populations don\u2019t exist. Such\nmodels lack (actual) target systems, and one hopes that an account of\nscientific representation would allow us to understand how these\nmodels work. This need not imply the claim that they are\nrepresentations in the same sense as models with actual targets, and,\nas we discuss below, there are accounts that deny targetless models\nthe status of being representations.\n\nA further condition of adequacy for an account of scientific\nrepresentation is that it must account for the directionality of\nrepresentation. As Goodman points out (1976: 5), representations are\nabout their targets, but (at least in general) targets are not about\ntheir representations: a photograph represents the cracks in the wing\nof aeroplane, but the wing does not represent the photograph. So there\nis an essential directionality to representations, and an account of\nscientific, or epistemic, representation has to identify the root of\nthis directionality. We call this the Requirement of\nDirectionality.\n\nSome representations, in particular models and theories, are\nmathematized and their mathematical aspects are crucial to their\ncognitive and representational function. This forces us to reconsider\na time-honoured philosophical puzzle: the applicability of mathematics\nin the empirical sciences. The problem can be traced back at least to\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus, but its modern expression is due to\nWigner who challenged us to find an explanation for the enormous\nusefulness of mathematics in the sciences (1960: 2). The question how\na mathematized model represents its target implies the question how\nmathematics applies to a physical system (see Pincock 2012 for an\nexplicit discussion of the relationship between scientific\nrepresentation and the applicability of mathematics). For this reason,\nour fifth and final condition of adequacy is that an account of\nrepresentation has to explain how mathematics is applied to the\nphysical world. We call this the Applicability of Mathematics\nCondition.\n\nIn answering the above questions one invariably runs up against a\nfurther problem, the Problem of Ontology: what kinds of\nobjects are representations? If representations are material objects\nthe answer is straightforward: photographic plates, pieces of paper\ncovered with ink, elliptical blocks of wood immersed in water, and so\non. But not all representations are like this. As Hacking (1983: 216)\nputs it, some representations one holds in one\u2019s head rather\nthan one\u2019s hands. The Newtonian model of the solar system, the\nLotka-Volterra model of predator-prey interaction and the general\ntheory of relativity are not things you can put on your laboratory\ntable and look at. The problem of ontology is to come clear on our\ncommitments and provide a list with things that we recognise\u2014or\ndon\u2019t recognise\u2014as entities performing a representational\nfunction and give an account of what they are in case these entities\nraise questions (what exactly do we mean by something that one holds\nin one\u2019s head rather than one\u2019s hands?). Contessa (2010),\nFrigg (2010a,b), Godfrey-Smith (2006), Levy (2015), Thomson-Jones\n(2010), Weisberg (2013), among others, have drawn attention to this\nproblem in different ways.\n\nIn sum, a theory of scientific representation has to respond to the\nfollowing issues:\n\nAddress the Representational Demarcation Problem (the\nquestion how scientific representations differ from other kinds of\nrepresentations).\nThose who demarcate scientific from non-scientific representations\nhave to provide an answer to the Scientific Representation\nProblem (fill the blank in \u201c\\(S\\) is a scientific\nrepresentation of \\(T\\) iff ___\u201d). Those who reject the\nrepresentational demarcation problem can address the Epistemic\nRepresentation Problem (fill the blank in ER-Scheme: \u201c\\(S\\)\nis an epistemic representation of \\(T\\) iff ___\u201d).\nRespond to the Problem of Style (what styles are there\nand how can they be characterised?).\nFormulate Standards of Accuracy (how do we identify what\nconstitutes an accurate representation?).\nAddress the Problem of Ontology (what are the kind of\nobjects that serve as representations?).\n\n\nAny satisfactory answer to these five issues will have to meet the\nfollowing five conditions of adequacy:\n\nSurrogative Reasoning (scientific representations allow\nus to generate hypotheses about their target systems).\nPossibility of Misrepresentation (if \\(S\\) does not\naccurately represent \\(T\\), then it is a misrepresentation but not a\nnon-representation).\nTargetless Models (what are we to make of scientific\nrepresentations that lack targets?).\nRequirement of Directionality (scientific representations\nare about their targets, but targets are not about their\nrepresentations).\nApplicability of Mathematics (how does the mathematical\napparatus used in some scientific representations latch onto the\nphysical world).\n\n\nListing the problems in this way is not to say that these are separate\nand unrelated issues. This division is analytical, not factual. It\nserves to structure the discussion and to assess proposals; it does\nnot imply that an answer to one of these questions can be dissociated\nfrom what stance we take on the other issues.\n\nAny attempt to tackle these questions faces an immediate\nmethodological problem. As per the problem of style, there are\ndifferent kinds of representations: scientific models, theories,\nmeasurement outcomes, images, graphs, diagrams, and linguistic\nassertions are all scientific representations, and even within these\ngroups there can be considerable variation. But every analysis has to\nstart somewhere, and so the problem is where. One might adopt a\nuniversalist position, holding that the diversity of styles dissolves\nunder analysis and at bottom all instances of scientific/epistemic\nrepresentation function in the same way and are covered by the same\noverarching account. For such a universalist the problem loses its\nteeth because any starting point will lead to the same result. Those\nof particularist bent deny that there is such a theory. They will\nfirst divide the scientific/epistemic representations into relevant\nsubclasses and then analyse each subclass separately.\n\nDifferent authors assume different stances in this debate, and we will\ndiscuss their positions below. However, there are few, if any,\nthoroughgoing universalists and so a review like the current one has\nto discuss different cases. Unfortunately space constraints prevent us\nfrom examining all the different varieties of scientific/epistemic\nrepresentation, and a selection has to be made. This invariably leads\nto the neglect of some kinds of representations, and the best we can\ndo about this is to be explicit about our choices. We resolve to\nconcentrate on scientific models, and therefore replace our variable\n\\(S\\) for the object doing the representing with the variable \\(M\\)\nfor model. This is in line both with the more recent literature on\nscientific representation, which is predominantly concerned with\nscientific models, and with the prime importance that current\nphilosophy of science attaches to models (see the SEP entry on\n models in science\n for a\n survey).[6]\n\nIt is, however, worth briefly mentioning some of the omissions that\nthis brings with it. Various types of images have their place in\nscience, and so do graphs, diagrams, and drawings. Perini (2010) and\nElkins (1999) provide discussions of visual representation in science.\nMeasurements also supply representations of processes in nature,\nsometimes together with the subsequent condensation of measurement\nresults in the form of charts, curves, tables and the like (see the\nSEP entry on\n measurement in science).\n Furthermore, theories represent their subject matter. At this point\nthe vexing problem of the nature of theories rears again (see the SEP\nentry on\n the structure of scientific theories\n and also Portides (2017) for an extensive discussion). Proponents of\nthe semantic view of theories construe theories as families of models,\nand so for them the question of how theories represent coincides with\nthe question of how models represent. By contrast, those who regard\ntheories as linguistic entities see theoretical representation as a\nspecial kind of linguistic representation and focus on the analysis of\nscientific languages, in particular the semantics of so-called\ntheoretical terms (see the SEP entry on\n theoretical terms in science).\n\nBefore delving into the discussion a common misconception needs to be\ndispelled. The misconception is that a representation is a mirror\nimage, a copy, or an imitation of the thing it represents. On this\nview representation is ipso facto realistic representation.\nThis is a mistake. Representations can be realistic, but they need\nnot. And representations certainly need not be copies of the real\nthing, an observation exploited by Lewis Carroll and Jorge Luis Borges\nin their satires, Sylvie and Bruno and On Exactitude in\nScience respectively, about cartographers who produce maps as\nlarge as the country itself only to see them abandoned (for a\ndiscussion see Boesch 2021). Throughout this review we encounter\npositions that make room for non-realistic representation and hence\ntestify to the fact that representation is a much broader notion than\n mirroring.[7]\n",
