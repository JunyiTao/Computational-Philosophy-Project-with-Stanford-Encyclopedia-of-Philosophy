    "main_text": "Separatism vs. unionism about metaphysical explanation\n3. Separatism vs. unionism about metaphysical explanation\n\nBefore, we said that metaphysical explanations \u201cderive their\nexplanatory power\u201d somehow from non-causal relationships. More\nspecific proposals about the nature and varieties of metaphysical\nexplanation diverge over which relationships those are, and how that\nwork is carried out. Any proposal, though, must confront perhaps the\nmost striking feature of any form of explanation, one that\nseems even more surprising in the case of metaphysical explanation.\nMetaphysical explanations seem to have one foot in the\nworld\u2014something to do with the way it is (causally or\nnon-causally) structured seems to play a role. Metaphysical\nexplanations are metaphysical, after all (or so one might\nthink). Yet they seem to have another foot in our thought and\ncommunication about the world\u2014our desire for explanation\n(even if not a natural one, as Aristotle claims) is at least in part a\ndesire to understand, to make the world intelligible\nto ourselves and others, to learn the why and how of things\nand what to expect, to satisfy our curiosity.\nMetaphysical explanations are explanations, after all (or so\none might think). Yet how could metaphysical explanation be at once\nmetaphysical, but also a form of explanation?\n\nFollowing Raven (2015), who applies the terminology to grounding and\ngrounding explanations in particular, approaches to this fundamental\nquestion might be classified with regard to whether they take a\n\u201cunionist\u201d or \u201cseparatist\u201d line. Standardly,\nunionism about grounding and grounding explanation is the\nthesis that they are one: to be grounded just is to be\nmetaphysically explained in a distinctive way (e.g., Dasgupta 2014;\nJenkins 2013; Litland 2013, 2017; Raven 2012; Rosen 2010; Thompson\n2016). (A unionist might also subscribe to the stronger thesis that\nthe expressions \u201cgrounded\u201d and \u201cexplained in\nsuch-and-such distinctive way\u201d are, or at least ought to be,\nused as synonyms, but that is not essential to how we understand the\nview here.) Unionists thus owe some account of how the metaphysical\nand explanatory elements of metaphysical explanation can be held\ntogether in a coherent package, or else jettison one element or the\nother. Separatism about grounding and grounding explanation\nis the thesis that they are separate, yet grounding explanations\nnonetheless \u201ctrack\u201d, or are \u201cbacked\u201d or\n\u201cunderwritten\u201d by, instances of grounding (e.g., Audi\n2012, Schaffer 2016, Trogdon 2013). Separatists thus owe some account\nof how that link keeps the metaphysical and explanatory elements of\nmetaphysical explanation from flying off in opposite directions. One\nmight think that the separatist about grounding explanation here\nincurs no new debt, since separatists about causal\nexplanation must meet an analogous challenge. However, note that the\nquasi-causal model of metaphysical explanation at play here is far\nfrom the only way in which we might model metaphysical explanation\n(see\n \u00a76),\n and also that to distinguish causation from causal explanation is\nitself a substantive commitment.\n\nIn order to extend the unionist-separatist classification to\nmetaphysical explanation in general, though, some care must\nbe taken. First (and most obviously), those who believe that there are\ntwo or more forms of metaphysical explanation need not be unionists or\nseparatists across the board. The extent to which one is a unionist or\na separatist should depend on what non-causal relations one takes\nstatements like (1)\u2013(4) to derive their explanatory power from,\nas well as on background assumptions about what kind of thing an\nexplanation is and what kinds of things it relates, or even whether\nthese statements ascribe relations at all on the final analysis. For\ninstance, we have spoken loosely of metaphysical explanations as\ntruths of a certain kind that can be discovered and argued\nover; one might take this view, and add to it the claim that they are\ntruths involving a relation between facts. Such a view might preclude\none from being a unionist about, say, essentialist explanations like\n(3), if one holds that they concern relationships that may involve\nthings that are not facts (e.g., Socrates and his father).\n\nSecond, a further complication is that there is an open question\nwhether the various non-causal relations by which metaphysical\nexplanations work must themselves \u201ctrack\u201d still\nfurther relations. For instance, one might maintain that instances of\ngrounding must somehow track the relations of whole to parts,\ndeterminable to determinate, role to realizer, set to members, or\nothers. Those with unionist sympathies must therefore be clear about\nwhether grounding explanations are to be identified with grounding or\nwith some non-causal relation that grounding tracks, while\nseparatists must be clear about whether grounding explanations work by\ntracking grounding, or by tracking some non-causal relation(s) that\ngrounding tracks. Similar points hold for essentialist and\nreductive explanations, if one holds the view that there are relations\nthat essence-accident and analysans-analysandum must\n\u201ctrack\u201d.\n\nFinally, there are viable approaches to metaphysical explanation that\ndo not fit neatly in either the unionist or separatist camp as it is\nstandardly understood. For instance, Maurin (2019) notes a distinction\nbetween those who believe that grounding is \u201cby its\nnature\u201d explanatory, as opposed to those who maintain that (at\nbest) grounding has certain other features that make it apt to back\ngrounding explanations. Interestingly, the former view (which counts\nas unionist on Maurin\u2019s classification) does not automatically\nimply that grounding be grounding explanation (which is\nrequired to count as unionist on Raven\u2019s classification). After\nall, knowledge is by its nature true, but it does not follow that\nknowledge is truth. Setting aside the less interesting question of how\none ought to use the term of art \u201cunionism\u201d,\nMaurin\u2019s proposal\u2014when broadened to metaphysical\nexplanation in general; see Thompson (2019)\u2014shows that there is\nconceptual space to distinguish the metaphysical and explanatory\nelements of metaphysical explanation yet without explicitly linking\nthem by appeal to a relation of backing.\n",
