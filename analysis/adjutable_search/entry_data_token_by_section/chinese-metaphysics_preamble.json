    "main_text": "\n\nWhile there was no word corresponding precisely to the term\n\u201cmetaphysics,\u201d China has a long tradition of philosophical\ninquiry concerned with the ultimate nature of reality\u2014its being,\norigins, components, ways of changing, and so on. In this sense, we\ncan speak of metaphysics in Chinese Philosophy, even if the particular\nquestions and positions that arose differed from those dominant in\nEurope. Explicit metaphysical discussions appeared in China with a\nturn toward questions of cosmogony in the mid-fourth century BCE.\nThese cosmogonies express views that became fundamental for almost all\nlater metaphysics in China. In these texts, all things are\ninterconnected and constantly changing. They arise spontaneously from\nan ultimate source (most often called dao \u9053, the way\nor guide) that resists objectification but is immanent in the world\nand accessible to cultivated people. Vitality and growth is the very\nnature of existence, and the natural world exhibits consistent\npatterns that can be observed and followed, in particular, cyclical\npatterns based on interaction between polar forces (such as\nyin \u9670 and yang \u967d).\n\nThis outlook differs from the assumptions that dominated metaphysical\nthinking in Europe after the introduction of Christianity: the belief\nthat the ultimate principle of the world is transcendent but\nanthropomorphic (as human beings are made in its image), that the\nthings of the world arise through design, and that the world is\ncomposed of ontologically distinct substances. These assumptions have\nbeen widely rejected by philosophers over the course of the\n20th century, and in the Chinese tradition we see one\npossibility for what metaphysics might look like if it were neither\napologizing for nor reacting against such views (in Nietzsche\u2019s\nterms, a metaphysics based neither on God nor the Death of God). This\nis not to say that Chinese metaphysics is homogenous or without its\nown problems. Rather, we can say that while European metaphysics has\ntended to center on problems of reconciliation (how\nontologically distinct things can interact), Chinese metaphysics has\nbeen more concerned with problems of distinction. The most\ncentral problems are around the status of individualized things, the\nrelationship between the patterns of nature and specifically human\nvalues, and how to understand the ultimate ground of the world in a\nway that avoids either reification or nihilism. These become problems\nprecisely because of the underlying assumptions of holism and\nchange.\n\nReaders should keep in mind that a survey of metaphysics in Chinese\nPhilosophy is no more adequate than such a survey would be regarding\nEurope. The entry has necessarily left out more than it has included.\nAside from introducing the most influential positions and\nphilosophers, the goal is to illuminate recurring patterns and\nconcerns that can serve as orientation for further reading.\n",
