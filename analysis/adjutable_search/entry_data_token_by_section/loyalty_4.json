    "main_text": "The structure of loyalty || Loyalty and loyalties\n3.1 Loyalty and loyalties\n\nSometimes we use \u201cloyalty\u201d to refer to the practical\ndisposition to persevere in affiliational attachments. More commonly\nwe speak of loyalties to specific associations. Our generic\ndisposition to be loyal is expressed in loyalties to certain\nkinds of natural or conventional associations, such as friendships,\nfamilies, organizations, professions, countries, and religions. There\nis a reason for this. Associations that evoke and exact our loyalty\ntend to be those with which we have become deeply involved or\nidentified. This is implicit in the working\ndefinition\u2019s reference to \u201cintrinsically valued\nassociational attachments.\u201d Intrinsically valued associational\nattachments are usually those with which we have developed some form\nof social identification. We have come to value the associational bond\nfor its own sake (whatever may have originally motivated it). Our\nloyalties are not just to any groups that may exist, or even to any\ngroup with which we have some association, but only to those to which\nwe are sufficiently closely bound to call ours. My loyalties\nare to my friends, my family, my\nprofession, or our country, not yours, unless yours are also\nmine. In such identifications, the fate or well-being of the objects\nof loyalty become bound up with one\u2019s own. We feel shame or\npride in their doings. We will take extra risks or bear special\nburdens for them.\n\nAlthough our primary loyalties tend to be to associations or groupings\nthat are socially valued, such that loyalty may seem to be an\nimportant practical disposition, this need not be the case. For in\ntheory, any association can become intrinsically important to us,\nwhether or not it is generally valued, and it may do so even if it is\nsocially despised. Gangs and crime families, may become objects of\nloyalty no less than professional associations and siblings.\n",
