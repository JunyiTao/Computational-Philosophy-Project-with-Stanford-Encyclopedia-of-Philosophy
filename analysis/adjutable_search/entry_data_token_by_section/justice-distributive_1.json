    "main_text": "Strict Egalitarianism\n2. Strict Egalitarianism\n\nOne of the simplest principles of distributive justice is that of\nstrict, or radical, equality. The principle says that every person\nshould have the same level of material goods (including burdens) and\nservices. The principle is most commonly justified on the grounds that\npeople are morally equal and that equality in material goods and\nservices is the best way to give effect to this moral ideal. \n\nEven with this ostensibly simple principle, some of the difficult\nspecification problems of distributive principles can be seen. The two\nmain problems are the construction of appropriate indices for\nmeasurement (the index problem), and the specification of time frames.\nBecause there are numerous proposed solutions to these problems, the\n\u2018principle of strict equality\u2019 is not a single principle\nbut a name for a group of closely related principles. This range of\npossible specifications occurs with all the common principles of\ndistributive justice.\n\nThe index problem arises primarily because the goods and services to\nbe distributed need to be measured if they are going to be distributed\naccording to some pattern (such as equality). The strict equality\nprinciple stated above says that there should be \u2018the same\nlevel of material goods and services\u2019. The problem is\nhow to specify and measure levels. The simplest way of solving the\nindex problem in the strict equality case is to specify that everyone\nshould have the same bundle of material goods and services\nrather than the same level (so everyone would have 4 oranges,\n6 apples, 1 bike, etc.). The problem with adopting this simple\nsolution is that there will be many other allocations of material\ngoods and services which will make some people better off without\nmaking anybody else worse off. Such allocations are what are called\n\u2018Pareto superior\u2019 allocations (see\n equality\n for a more detailed discussion of Pareto efficiency). For instance,\nsomeone who prefers apples to oranges will be better off if she swaps\nsome of her oranges for some of the apples belonging to a person who\nprefers oranges. That way, they are both better off and no one is\nworse off. Indeed, since most everyone will wish to trade something,\nrequiring identical equal bundles will make virtually everybody worse\noff than they would be under an alternative allocation. So specifying\nthat everybody must have the same bundle of goods does not\nseem to be a satisfactory way of solving the index problem. Some index\nfor measuring the value of goods and services is required.\n\nMoney is an index for the value of material goods and services. It is\nan imperfect index whose pitfalls are documented in most economics\ntextbooks. Moreover, once the goods to be allocated are extended\nbeyond material ones to include goods such as opportunities, money\nmust be combined with other indices. (For instance, John Rawls\u2019\nindex of primary goods\u2014see Rawls 1971.) Nevertheless, using\nmoney, either in the form of income or wealth or both, as an index for\nthe value of material goods and services is the most common response\nto the index problem. In terms of public, rather than academic\ndiscourse, GDP (gross domestic product) or per capita GDP is most\ncommonly touted as the way to measure the effect of governments\u2019\npolicies on the population\u2019s well-being. The deficiencies in\nsuch indices has now been well-documented and has lead to the\nproposing of better alternative indices such as the Human Development\nIndex (HDI) and Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI).\nUnfortunately, the general population is generally unaware of these\nmore accurate indices and so are disadvantaged in their ability to\njudge the distributive justice effects of their governments\u2019\npolicies. \n\nThe second main specification problem involves time frames. Many\ndistributive principles identify and require that a particular pattern\nof distribution be achieved or at least be pursued as the objective of\ndistributive justice. But they also need to specify when the\npattern is required. One version of the principle of strict equality\nrequires that all people should have the same wealth at some initial\npoint, after which people are free to use their wealth in whatever way\nthey choose, with the consequence that future outcomes are bound to be\nunequal. Principles specifying initial distributions after which the\npattern need not be preserved are commonly called\n\u2018starting-gate\u2019 principles. (See Ackerman 1980,\n53\u201359,168\u2013170,180\u2013186; Alstott and Ackerman\n1999.)\n\nBecause \u2018starting-gate\u2019 principles may eventually lead to\nlarge inequalities, strict egalitarians do not usually favor them. The\nmost common form of strict equality principle specifies that\nincome (measured in terms of money) should be equal in\neach time-frame, though even this may lead to significant\ndisparities in wealth if variations in savings are permitted. Hence,\nstrict equality principles are commonly conjoined with some\nsociety-wide specification of just saving behavior (see\n justice: intergenerational).\n In practice, however, this principle and the starting-gate version\nmight require more similar distributions than it first appears. This\nis because the structure of the family means the requirement to give\npeople equal starts will often necessitate redistribution to parents,\nwho due to bad luck, bad management, or simply their own choices, have\nbeen unsuccessful in accruing or holding on to material goods.\n\nThere are a number of direct moral criticisms made of strict equality\nprinciples: that they unduly restrict freedom, that they do not give\nbest effect to the moral equality of persons, that they conflict with\nwhat people deserve, etc. (see the sections on\n Libertarian Principles,\n and\n Desert-Based Principles,\n and the entry on\n equality).\n But the most common criticism is a welfare-based one related to the\nPareto efficiency requirement: that everyone can be materially better\noff if incomes are not strictly equal (Carens 1981). It is this\ncriticism which partly inspired the Difference Principle.\n",
