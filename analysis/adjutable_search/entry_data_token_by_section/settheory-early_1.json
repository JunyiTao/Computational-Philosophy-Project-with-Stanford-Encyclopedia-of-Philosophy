    "main_text": "Consolidation\n2. Consolidation\n\nSet theory was beginning to become an essential ingredient of the new\n\u201cmodern\u201d approach to mathematics. But this viewpoint was\ncontested, and its consolidation took a rather long time.\nDedekind\u2019s algebraic style only began to find followers in the\n1890s; David Hilbert was among them. The soil was better prepared for\nthe modern theories of real functions: Italian, German, French and\nBritish mathematicians contributed during the 1880s. And the new\nfoundational views were taken up by Peano and his followers, by Frege\nto some extent, by Hilbert in the 1890s, and later by Russell.\n\nMeanwhile, Cantor spent the years 1878 to 1885 publishing key works\nthat helped turn set theory into an autonomous branch of mathematics.\nLet\u2019s write \\(A \\equiv B\\) in order to express that the two sets\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\) can be put in one-to-one correspondence (have\nthe same cardinality). After proving that the irrational numbers can\nbe put in one-to-one correspondence with \\(\\mathbf{R}\\), and,\nsurprisingly, that also \\(\\mathbf{R}^{n} \\equiv \\mathbf{R}\\), Cantor\nconjectured in 1878 that any subset of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) would be\neither denumerable \\((\\equiv \\mathbf{N})\\) or \\(\\equiv \\mathbf{R}\\).\nThis is the first and weakest form of the celebrated Continuum\nHypothesis. During the following years, Cantor explored the world\nof point sets, introducing several important topological ideas (e.g.,\nperfect set, closed set, isolated set), and arrived at results such as\nthe Cantor-Bendixson theorem.\n\nA point set \\(P\\) is closed iff its derived set \\(P'\n\\subseteq P\\), and perfect iff \\(P = P'\\). The\nCantor-Bendixson theorem then states that a closed point set can be\ndecomposed into two subsets \\(R\\) and \\(S\\), such that\n\\(R\\) is denumerable and \\(S\\) is perfect (indeed,\n\\(S\\) is the \\(a\\)th derived set of \\(P\\),\nfor a countable ordinal \\(a\\)). Because of this, closed sets are\nsaid to have the perfect set property. Furthermore, Cantor was able to\nprove that perfect sets have the power of the continuum (1884). Both\nresults implied that the Continuum Hypothesis is valid for all closed\npoint sets. Many years later, in 1916, Pavel Aleksandrov and Felix\nHausdorff were able to show that the broader class of Borel sets have\nthe perfect set property too.\n\nHis work on points sets led Cantor, in 1882, to conceive of the\ntransfinite numbers (see Ferreir\u00f3s 1999:\n267ff). This was a turning point in his research, for from\nthen onward he studied abstract set theory independently of\nmore specific questions having to do with point sets and their\ntopology (until the mid-1880s, these questions had been prominent in\nhis agenda). Subsequently, Cantor focused on the transfinite cardinal\nand ordinal numbers, and on general order types, independently of the\ntopological properties of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\).\n\nThe transfinite ordinals were introduced as new numbers in an\nimportant mathematico-philosophical paper of 1883, Grundlagen\neiner allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre (notice that Cantor\nstill uses Riemann\u2019s term Mannigfaltigkeit or\n\u2018manifold\u2019 to denote sets). Cantor defined them by means\nof two \u201cgenerating principles\u201d: the first (1) yields the\nsuccessor \\(a+1\\) for any given number \\(a\\), while the second (2)\nstipulates that there is a number \\(b\\) which follows immediately\nafter any given sequence of numbers without a last element. Thus,\nafter all the finite numbers comes, by (2), the first transfinite\nnumber, \\(\\omega\\) (read: omega); and this is followed by\n\\(\\omega+1\\), \\(\\omega+2\\), \u2026, \\(\\omega+\\omega = \\omega \\cdot\n2\\), \u2026, \\(\\omega \\cdot n\\), \\(\\omega\\cdot n +1\\), \u2026,\n\\(\\omega^{2}\\), \\(\\omega^{2}+1\\), \u2026, \\(\\omega^{\\omega}\\),\n\u2026 and so on and on. Whenever a sequence without last element\nappears, one can go on and, so to say, jump to a higher stage by\n(2).\n\nThe introduction of these new numbers seemed like idle speculation to\nmost of his contemporaries, but for Cantor they served two very\nimportant functions. To this end, he classified the transfinite\nordinals as follows: the \u201cfirst number class\u201d consisted of\nthe finite ordinals, the set \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) of natural numbers;\nthe \u201csecond number class\u201d was formed by \u03c9 and all\nnumbers following it (including \\(\\omega^{\\omega}\\), and many more)\nthat have only a denumerable set of predecessors. This\ncrucial condition was suggested by the problem of proving the\nCantor-Bendixson theorem (see Ferreir\u00f3s 1995). On that basis,\nCantor could establish the results that the cardinality of the\n\u201csecond number class\u201d is greater than that of\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\); and that no intermediate cardinality exists. Thus,\nif you write \\(\\textit{card}(\\mathbf{N}) = \\aleph_{0}\\) (read: aleph\nzero), his theorems justified calling the cardinality of the\n\u201csecond number class\u201d \\(\\aleph_{1}\\).\n\nAfter the second number class comes a \u201cthird number class\u201d\n(all transfinite ordinals whose set of predecessors has cardinality\n\\(\\aleph_{1}\\)); the cardinality of this new number class can be\nproved to be \\(\\aleph_{2}\\). And so on. The first function of the\ntransfinite ordinals was, thus, to establish a well-defined scale of\nincreasing transfinite cardinalities. (The aleph notation used above\nwas introduced by Cantor only in 1895.) This made it possible to\nformulate much more precisely the problem of the continuum;\nCantor\u2019s conjecture became the hypothesis that\n\\(\\textit{card}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\aleph_{1}\\). Furthermore, relying on\nthe transfinite ordinals, Cantor was able to prove the\nCantor-Bendixson theorem, rounding out the results on point sets that\nhe had been elaborating during these crucial years. The\nCantor-Bendixson theorem states: closed sets of \\(\\mathbf{R}^n\\)\n(generalizable to Polish spaces) have the perfect set property, so\nthat any closed set \\(S\\) in \\(\\mathbf{R}^n\\) can be written uniquely\nas the disjoint union of a perfect set \\(P\\) and a countable set\n\\(R\\). Moreover, \\(P\\) is \\(S^\u03b1\\) for \u03b1 countable\nordinal.\n\nThe study of the transfinite ordinals directed Cantor\u2019s\nattention towards ordered sets, and in particular well-ordered\nsets. A set \\(S\\) is well-ordered by a relation < iff\n< is a total order and every subset of \\(S\\) has a least\nelement in the <-ordering. (The real numbers are not well-ordered\nin their usual order: just consider an open interval. Meanwhile,\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\) is the simplest infinite well-ordered set.) Cantor\nargued that the transfinite ordinals truly deserve the name of\nnumbers, because they express the \u201ctype of order\u201d\nof any possible well-ordered set. Notice also that it was easy for\nCantor to indicate how to reorder the natural numbers so as to make\nthem correspond to the order types \\(\\omega+1\\), \\(\\omega+2\\),\n\u2026, \\(\\omega \\cdot 2\\), \u2026, \\(\\omega \\cdot n\\), \u2026,\n\\(\\omega^2\\), \u2026, \\(\\omega^{\\omega}\\), \u2026 and so on. (For\ninstance, reordering \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) in the form: 2, 4, 6,\n\u2026, 5, 15, 25, 35, \u2026, 1, 3, 7, 9, \u2026 we obtain a\nset that has order type \\(\\omega\\cdot 3\\).)\n\nNotice too that the Continuum Hypothesis, if true, would entail that\nthe set \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) of real numbers can indeed be well-ordered.\nCantor was so committed to this viewpoint, that he presented the\nfurther hypothesis that every set can be well-ordered as\n\u201ca fundamental and momentous law of thought\u201d. Some years\nlater, Hilbert called attention to both the Continuum Hypothesis and\nthe well-ordering problem as Problem 1 in his celebrated list of\n\u2018Mathematische Probleme\u2019 (1900). Doing so was an\nintelligent way of emphasizing the importance of set theory for the\nfuture of mathematics, and the fruitfulness of its new methods and\nproblems.\n\nIn 1895 and 1897, Cantor published his last two articles. They were a\nwell-organized presentation of his results on the transfinite numbers\n(cardinals and ordinals) and their theory, and also on order types and\nwell-ordered sets. However, these papers did not advance significant\nnew ideas. Unfortunately, Cantor had doubts about a third part he had\nprepared, which would have discussed very important issues having to\ndo with the problem of well-ordering and the paradoxes (see below).\nSurprisingly, Cantor also failed to include in the 1895/97 papers a\ntheorem which he had published some years before which is known simply\nas Cantor\u2019s Theorem: given any set \\(S\\), there exists another\nset whose cardinality is greater (this is the power set\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(S)\\), as we now say\u2014Cantor used instead the set of\nall functions of the form \\(f\\): \\(S \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}\\), which is\nequivalent). In the same short paper (1892), Cantor presented his\nfamous proof that \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is non-denumerable by the method of\ndiagonalisation, a method which he then extended to prove\nCantor\u2019s Theorem. (A related form of argument had appeared\nearlier in the work of P. du Bois-Reymond [1875], see among others\n[Wang 1974, 570] and [Borel 1898], Note II.)\n\nMeanwhile, other authors were exploring the possibilities opened by\nset theory for the foundations of mathematics. Most important was\nDedekind\u2019s contribution (1888) with a deep presentation of the\ntheory of the natural numbers. He formulated some basic principles of\nset (and mapping) theory; gave axioms for the natural number system;\nproved that mathematical induction is conclusive and recursive\ndefinitions are flawless; developed the basic theory of arithmetic;\nintroduced the finite cardinals; and proved that his axiom system is\ncategorical. His system had four axioms. Given a function \u03c6\ndefined on \\(S\\), a set \\(N \\subseteq S\\), and a distinguished\nelement \\(1 \\in N\\), they are as follows: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tag{\u03b1} & \\phi(N) \\subset N\\\\\n\\tag{\u03b2} & N = \\phi_{o}\\{1\\}\\\\\n\\tag{\u03b3} & 1 \\not\\in \\phi(N)\\\\\n\\tag{\u03b4} & \\textrm{the function } \\phi \\textrm{ is injective.}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nCondition (\u03b2) is crucial since it ensures minimality for the set\nof natural numbers, which accounts for the validity of proofs by\nmathematical induction. \\(N = \\phi_{o}\\{1\\}\\) is read: \\(N\\) is\nthe chain of singleton {1} under the function \u03c6, that is,\nthe minimal closure of {1} under the function \u03c6. In general, one\nconsiders the chain of a set \\(A\\) under an arbitrary mapping\n\u03b3, denoted by \\(\\gamma_{o}(A)\\); in his booklet Dedekind\ndeveloped an interesting theory of such chains, which allowed him to\nprove the Cantor-Bernstein theorem. The theory was later generalized\nby Zermelo and applied by Skolem, Kuratowski, etc.\n\nIn the following years, Giuseppe Peano gave a more superficial (but\nalso more famous) treatment of the natural numbers, employing the new\nsymbolic language of logic, and Gottlob Frege elaborated his own\nideas, which however fell prey to the paradoxes. An important book\ninspired by the set-theoretic style of thinking was Hilbert\u2019s\nGrundlagen der Geometrie (1899), which took the\n\u201cmathematics of axioms\u201d one step beyond Dedekind through a\nrich study of geometric systems motivated by questions concerning the\nindependence of his axioms. Hilbert\u2019s book made clear the new\naxiomatic methodology that had been shaping up in connection with the\nnovel methods of set theory, and he combined it with the axiomatic\ntrends coming from projective geometry.\n\nNevertheless, as we said before, there was quite a lot of criticism of\nset-theoretic, infinitarian methods.  As early as 1870, Kronecker had\nbegun to voice critical remarks of a constructivist bent that, many\nyears later, would be echoed by prominent thinkers like Brouwer or\nWittgenstein. Kronecker\u2019s critical orientation pointed in the\nway of renouncing the real number system and classical analysis, in\nfavor of some more stringent form of analysis \u2014 twentieth\ncentury examples of this would be predicative analysis (H. Weyl\nbuilding on basic notions of Poincar\u00e9, see Feferman 1988) and\nintuitionistic analysis (Brouwer). Even Weierstrass had objections (in\n1874, at least) against the idea of distinguishing sizes of infinity,\nand that on the face of Cantor\u2019s proofs. Examples abound, and so\nduring the 1900s many mathematicians expressed doubts about key ideas\nand methods of set theory. A prototype case is E. Borel, who after\nintroducing the ideas of Cantor in France [1898], became increasingly\nsuspicious of set theory (the five letters exchanged by him and Baire,\nLebesgue, Hadamard in 1905 have become famous; see Ewald [1996,\nvol. 2]). But there are also the cases of Poincar\u00e9, Weyl,\nSkolem, and so on. Among philosophers, the most prominent example is\nWittgenstein, who condemned set theory for building on the \"nonsense\"\nof fictitious symbolism, suggesting \u201cwrong imagery\u201d, and\nso on.\n \n",
