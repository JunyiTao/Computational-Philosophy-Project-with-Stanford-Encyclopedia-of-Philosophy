In the most thorough treatment\nof the history of the concept of scientific revolution, I. B. Cohen\n(1985) notes that the French word revolution was being used\nin early eighteenth-century France to mark significant developments.\nBy mid-century it was pretty clear that Clairaut, D\u2019Alembert,\nDiderot and others sometimes applied the term to scientific\ndevelopments, including Newton\u2019s achievement but also to\nDescartes\u2019 rejection of Aristotelian philosophy. Cohen fails to\nnote that \u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet preceded them, in her\nInstitutions de Physique of 1740, where she distinguished\nscientific from political revolutions (Ch\u00e2telet and Zinnser\n2009, p. 118). However, the definition of revolution in the\nEncyclop\u00e9die of the French philosophes was\nstill political. Toward the end of the century, Condorcet could speak\nof Lavoisier as having brought about a revolution in chemistry; and,\nindeed, Lavoisier and his associates also applied the term to their\nwork, as did Cuvier to his. Meanwhile, of course, Kant, in The\nCritique of Pure Reason (first edition 1781), spoke of his\n\u201cCopernican Revolution\u201d in philosophy. In fact, Cohen\n(1985) and Ian Hacking (2012) credit Kant with originating the idea of\na scientific revolution, although Kant had read Du Ch\u00e2telet.\nInterestingly, for Kant (1798) political revolutions are, by nature,\nunlawful, whereas Locke, in his social contract theory, had permitted\nthem under special circumstances.\n\nIt was during the twentieth century that talk of scientific\nrevolutions slowly gained currency. One can find scientists using the\nterm occasionally. For example, young Einstein, in a letter to his\nfriend Habicht, describes his new paper on light quanta as \u201cvery\nrevolutionary\u201d (Klein 1963, 59). The idea of radical breaks was\nforeign to such historians of science as Pierre Duhem and George\nSarton, but Alexandre Koyr\u00e9, in \u00c9tudes\nGalil\u00e9ennes (1939), rejected inductivist history,\ninterpreting the work of Galileo as a sort of Platonic intellectual\ntransformation. (See Zambelli (2016) for a revealing account of\nKoyr\u00e9\u2019s own background.) In The Origins of Modern\nScience: 1300\u20131800 (1949 and later editions), widely used\nas a course text, Herbert Butterfield, a political historian working\nmainly from secondary sources, wrote a compact summary of the\nScientific Revolution, one that emphasized the importance of\nconceptual transformation rather than the infusion of new empirical\ninformation. The anti-whiggism that he had advocated in his The\nWhig Interpretation of History (1931) became a major constraint\non the new historiography of science, especially in the Anglophone\nworld. In Origins, Butterfield applied the revolution label\nnot only to the Scientific Revolution and to several of its components\nbut also to \u201cThe Postponed Revolution in Chemistry\u201d (a\nchapter title), as if it were a delayed component of the Scientific\nRevolution. His history ended there. A revolution for Butterfield is a\nmajor event that founds a scientific field. Taken together, these\nrevolutions founded modern science. As the title of his book suggests,\nhe was concerned with origins, not with what comes after the founding.\nIn the Introduction he famously (or notoriously) stated that the\nScientific Revolution\n\noutshines everything since the rise of Christianity and reduces the\nRenaissance and Reformation to the rank of mere episodes, mere\ninternal displacements, within the system of medieval Christendom.\n\n\nFor Butterfield, the Scientific Revolution was a watershed event on\nthe scale of total human history, an event that, somewhat ironically\nand somewhat like Christianity according to its believers, enabled the\nsciences, to some degree, to escape from history and thereby to become\nexceptional among human endeavors. Subsequently, A. Rupert Hall, a\nfull-fledged historian of science who worked from primary sources,\npublished The Scientific Revolution: 1500\u20131800 (Hall\n1954). Soon many other scholars spoke of the Scientific\nRevolution, the achievements of the period from Copernicus to Newton,\nincluding such luminaries as Kepler, Galileo, Bacon, Descartes,\nHuygens, Boyle, and Leibniz.\n\nThen Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend challenged received views of\nscience and made talk of revolutionary breaks and incommensurability\ncentral to the emerging new field of history and philosophy of\nscience. They asserted that major conceptual changes lay in the future\nof mature, modern sciences as well as in their past. Kuhn (1962, ch.\nIX) contended that there will be no end to scientific revolutions as\nlong as systematic scientific investigation continues, for they are a\nnecessary vehicle of ongoing scientific progress\u2013necessary to\nbreak out of dated conceptual frameworks. In other words, there are\nboth founding revolutions, in something like Butterfield\u2019s sense\nof threshold events to maturity, and a never-ending series of later\nrevolutions within an ongoing field, no matter how mature it is.\nHowever, soon after Structure, Kuhn had second thoughts and\neventually abandoned the Butterfield conception of revolution, on the\nground that even his so-called preparadigm schools had their paradigms\n(Kuhn 1974, 460, note 4; details below). So multiple Kuhnian paradigms\nin long-term competition now became possible.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution was the topic around which the field of\nhistory of science itself came to maturity. Kuhn\u2019s\npopularization of the idea that even the mature natural sciences\nundergo deep conceptual change stimulated much general intellectual\ninterest in the history of science during the 1960s and 1970s. The\nrevolution frame of reference was also a boon to historiographical\nnarrative itself (see Cohen 1985 and Nickles 2006). And by challenging\nthe received, quasi-foundational, Enlightenment conception of science,\nhistory of science and related philosophies of science gained great\ncultural significance for a time.\n\nIn recent decades, however, many historians have contested even the\nclaim that there was a single, coherent development appropriately\ncalled \u201cthe Scientific Revolution.\u201d Steven Shapin (1996,\n1) captured the unease in his opening sentence: \u201cThere was no\nsuch thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about\nit.\u201d Everyone agrees that a series of rapid developments of\nvarious kinds took place during the period in question, but the\noperative word here is \u2018various\u2019. One difficulty is that\nno one has succeeded in capturing a 150-year (or more) period of work\nin an insightful, widely accepted characterization that embraces the\nimportant changes in theory, method, practices, instrumentation,\nsocial organization, and social status ranging over such a wide\nvariety of projects. The very attempt has come to seem reductionist.\nOlder styles of historical writing were characterized by grand\nnarratives such as \u201cthe mechanization of the world\npicture\u201d (Dijksterhuis 1961; original, Dutch edition, 1950) and\nhumanity\u2019s passage from subjective superstition to objectivity\nand mathematical precision (Gillispie 1960). Philosophically oriented\nwriters attempted to find unity and progress in terms of the discovery\nof a new, special scientific method. Today even most philosophers of\nscience dismiss the claim that there exists a powerful, general,\nscientific method, the discovery of which explains the Scientific\nRevolution and the success of modern science. Quite the contrary:\neffective scientific methods are themselves the product of painstaking\nwork at the frontier\u2014scientific results methodized\u2014and are\nhence typically laden with the technical content of the specialty in\nquestion. There is no content-neutral, thereby general and timeless\nmethod that magically explains how those results were achieved\n(Schuster and Yeo 1986, Nickles 2009).\n\nContinuity theorists such as Pierre Duhem (1914), John Herman Randall\n(1940), A. C. Crombie (1959, 1994), and more recent historians such as\nPeter Dear (2001) have pointed out a second major difficulty in\nspeaking of \u201cthe Scientific Revolution.\u201d It is hard to\nlocate the sharp break from medieval and Renaissance practices that\ndiscontinuity historians from Koyr\u00e9 to Kuhn have celebrated.\nWhen examined closely in their own cultural context, all the supposed\nrevolutionaries are found to have had one foot in the old traditions\nand to have relied heavily on the work of predecessors. In this vein,\nJ. M. Keynes famously remarked that Newton was \u201cthe last of the\nmagicians,\u201d not the first of the age of reason (Keynes 1947).\nStill, most historians and philosophers would agree that the rate of\nchange of scientific development increased notably during this period.\nHence, Shapin, despite his professional reservations, could still\nwrite an instructive, synthetic book about the Scientific Revolution.\nThe most thorough appraisal of historiographical treatments of the\nScientific Revolution is H. Floris Cohen\u2019s (1994).\n\nThe Scientific Revolution supposedly encompassed all of science or\nnatural philosophy, as it then existed, with major social\nimplications, as opposed to more recent talk of revolutions within\nparticular technical fields. Have there been other multidisciplinary\nrevolutions? Some have claimed the existence of a \u201csecond\nscientific revolution\u201d in the institutional structure of the\nsciences in the decades around 1800, especially in France, others\n(including Kuhn 1977a, ch. 3) of a multidisciplinary revolution in the\n\u201cBaconian sciences\u201d (chemistry, electricity, magnetism,\nheat, etc.) during roughly the same time period. Enrico Bellone 1980),\nKuhn, and others Kuhn have focused on the tremendous increase in\nmathematical abstraction and sophistication during the early-to-mid\nnineteenth century that essentially created what we know as\nmathematical physics. Still others have claimed that there was a\ngeneral revolution in the sciences in the decades around 1900. (See\nalso Cohen 1985, chap. 6, for discussion of these claims.)\n\nFor many historians, \u2018the Scientific Revolution\u2019 now\ndescribes a topic area rather than a clearly demarcated event. They\nfind it safer to divide the Scientific Revolution into several more\ntopic- and project-specific developments. However, in their unusually\ncomprehensive history of science textbook, Peter Bowler and Iwan Morus\n(2005) query of practically every major development they discuss\nwhether or not it was a genuine revolution at all, at least by Kuhnian\nstandards. More recently, David Wootton\u2019s (2015) is a\nrevisionist account that returns to a more heroic understanding of the\nScientific Revolution.\n",
