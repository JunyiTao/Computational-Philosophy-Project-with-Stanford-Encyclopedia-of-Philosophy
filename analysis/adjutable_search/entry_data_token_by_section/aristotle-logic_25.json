To\nfind a definition of \\(X\\), first locate the largest kind of thing\nunder which \\(X\\) falls; then, divide that kind into two parts, and\ndecide which of the two \\(X\\) falls into. Repeat this method with the\npart until \\(X\\) has been fully located.\n\nThis method is part of Aristotle\u2019s Platonic legacy. His attitude\ntowards it, however, is complex. He adopts a view of the proper\nstructure of definitions that is closely allied to it: a correct\ndefinition of \\(X\\) should give the genus\n(genos: kind or family) of \\(X\\), which tells what kind of\nthing \\(X\\) is, and the differentia\n(diaphora: difference) which uniquely identifies \\(X\\) within\nthat genus. Something defined in this way is a\nspecies (eidos: the term is one of\nPlato\u2019s terms for \u201cForm\u201d), and the differentia is\nthus the \u201cdifference that makes a species\u201d (eidopoios\ndiaphora, \u201cspecific difference\u201d). In Posterior\nAnalytics II.13, he gives his own account of the use of Division\nin finding definitions.\n\nHowever, Aristotle is strongly critical of the Platonic view of\nDivision as a method for establishing definitions. In\nPrior Analytics I.31, he contrasts Division with the\nsyllogistic method he has just presented, arguing that Division cannot\nactually prove anything but rather assumes the very thing it is\nsupposed to be proving. He also charges that the partisans of Division\nfailed to understand what their own method was capable of proving.\n",
