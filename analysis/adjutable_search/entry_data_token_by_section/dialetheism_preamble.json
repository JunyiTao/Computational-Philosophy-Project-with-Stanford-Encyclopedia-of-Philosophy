    "main_text": "\n\nA dialetheia is a sentence, \\(A\\), such that both it and its\nnegation, \\(\\neg A\\), are true. If falsity is assumed to be the truth\nof negation, a dialetheia is a sentence which is both true and false.\nSuch a sentence is, or has, what is called a truth value\nglut, in distinction to a gap, a sentence that is\nneither true nor false. (We shall talk of sentences throughout this\nentry; but one could run the definition in terms of propositions,\nstatements, or whatever one takes as one\u2019s favourite\ntruth-bearer: this would make little difference in the context.)\n\nDialetheism is the view that there are dialetheias. If we\ndefine a\n contradiction\n as a couple of sentences, one of which is the negation of the other,\nor as a conjunction of such sentences, then dialetheism amounts to the\nclaim that there are true contradictions. As such,\ndialetheism opposes\u2014contradicts\u2014the Law of\nNon-Contradiction (LNC), sometimes also called the Law of\nContradiction. The Law can be expressed in various ways; fixing the\nprecise formulation is itself a topic of debate (Priest et al 2004,\nPart II). Thomas Reid put the LNC in the form \u2018No proposition is\nboth true and false\u2019. A strong (modal) statement of the LNC is:\nfor any \\(A\\), it is impossible that both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) be\ntrue. \n\nIn Book \\(\\Gamma\\) of the Metaphysics, Aristotle introduced\n(what was later to be called) the LNC as \u201cthe most certain of\nall principles\u201d (1005b24)\u2014firmissimum omnium\nprincipiorum, as the Medieval theologians said. Since Aristotle,\nthere have been few sustained attempts to defend the law. The\nLNC has been an (often unstated) assumption, felt to be so fundamental\nto rationality that some claim it cannot be defended, e.g.\nDavid Lewis 1999. As a challenge to the LNC, therefore, dialetheism\nassails what most philosophers take to be unassailable common sense,\ncalling into question the rules for what can be called into question\n(cf. Woods 2003, 2005; Dutilh Novaes 2008). \n\nSince the advent of\n paraconsistent logic\n in the second half of the twentieth century, dialetheism has been\ndeveloped as a view in philosophical logic, with precise formal\nlanguage. Dialetheism has been most famously advanced as a response to\n logical paradoxes,\n in tandem with a paraconsistent logic. The view has been gaining, if\nnot acceptance, the respect of other parties in the debate; one critic\nwrites that dialetheists have shown,\n\nas clearly as anything like this can be shown, that it is coherent to\nmaintain that some sentences can be true and false at the same time.\n\u2026 [A]nd that perhaps is a radical conclusion, and a major\nadvance in our understanding of the issues (Parsons 1990).\n\n\nIn this article, 1) we will start by explaining the connection between\ndialetheism and other important related concepts, such as the ones of\ntrivialism and paraconsistency. Next, we will describe 2) the history\nof dialetheism and 3) the motivations for contemporary dialetheism,\namong which the logical (semantic and set-theoretic) paradoxes figure\nprominently, though not exclusively. We will then 4) indicate and\ndiscuss some of the objections to dialetheism, and 5) its connections\nwith the notion of rationality. Finally, 6) we will point at some\npossible themes for further inquiry concerning the connections between\ndialetheism, realism and antirealism in metaphysics.\n",
