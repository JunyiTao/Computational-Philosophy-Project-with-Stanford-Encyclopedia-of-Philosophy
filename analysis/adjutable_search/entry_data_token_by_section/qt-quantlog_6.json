    "main_text": "Interpretations of Quantum Logic || Realist Quantum Logic\n2.1 Realist Quantum Logic\n\nThe interpretation of projection operators as representing the\nproperties of a physical system is already explicit in von\nNeumann\u2019s Grundlagen.. However, the logical operations\ndiscussed there apply only to commuting projections, which are\nidentified with simultaneously decidable propositions. In 1936\nBirkhoff and von Neumann took a step further, proposing to interpret\nthe lattice-theoretic meet and join of projections as their\nconjunction and disjunction, whether or not they commute.\nImmediately this proposal faces the problem that the lattice\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) is not distributive, making it impossible to give\nthese \u201cquantum\u201d connectives a truth-functional\ninterpretation. Undaunted, von Neumann and Birkhoff suggested that the\nempirical success of quantum mechanics as a framework for physics\ncasts into doubt the universal validity of the distributive laws of\npropositional logic. Their phrasing remains cautious:\n\nWhereas logicians have usually assumed that properties \u2026 of\nnegation were the ones least able to withstand a critical analysis,\nthe study of mechanics points to the distributive identities \u2026\nas the weakest link in the algebra of logic. (1936: 837)\n\n\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, this thesis was advanced rather more\naggressively by a number of authors, including especially David\nFinkelstein and Hilary Putnam, who argued that quantum mechanics\nrequires a revolution in our understanding of logic per se.\nAccording to Putnam, \u201cLogic is as empirical as geometry.\n\u2026 We live in a world with a non-classical logic\u201d ([1968]\n1979: 184).\n\nFor Putnam, the elements of \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) represent categorical\nproperties that an object possesses, or does not, independently of\nwhether or not we look. Inasmuch as this picture of physical\nproperties is confirmed by the empirical success of quantum mechanics,\nwe must, on this view, accept that the way in which physical\nproperties actually hang together is not Boolean. Since logic is, for\nPutnam, very much the study of how physical properties actually hang\ntogether, he concludes that classical logic is simply mistaken: the\ndistributive law is not universally valid.\n\nClassically, if \\(S\\) is the set of states of a physical system, then\nevery subset of \\(S\\) corresponds to a categorical property\nof the system, and vice versa. In quantum mechanics, the state space\nis the (projective) unit sphere \\(S = S(\\mathbf{H})\\) of a Hilbert\nspace. However, not all subsets of \\(S\\) correspond to\nquantum-mechanical properties of the system. The latter correspond\nonly to subsets of the special form \\(S \\cap \\mathbf{M}\\), for\n\\(\\mathbf{M}\\) a closed linear subspace of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). In\nparticular, only subsets of this form are assigned probabilities. This\nleaves us with two options. One is to take only these special\nproperties as \u201creal\u201d (or \u201cphysical\u201d, or\n\u201cmeaningful\u201d), regarding more general subsets of \\(S\\) as\ncorresponding to no real categorical properties at all. The other is\nto regard the \u201cquantum\u201d properties as a small subset of\nthe set of all physically (or at any rate, metaphysically) reasonable,\nbut not necessarily observable, properties of the system. On\nthis latter view, the set of all properties of a physical\nsystem is entirely classical in its logical structure, but we decline\nto assign probabilities to the non-observable\n properties.[3]\n\nThis second position, while certainly not inconsistent with realism\nper se, turns upon a distinction involving a notion of\n\u201cobservation\u201d, \u201cmeasurement\u201d,\n\u201ctest\u201d, or something of this sort\u2014a notion that\nrealists are often at pains to avoid in connection with fundamental\nphysical theory. Of course, any realist account of a statistical\nphysical theory such as quantum mechanics will ultimately have to\nrender up some explanation of how measurements are supposed to take\nplace. That is, it will have to give an account of which physical\ninteractions between \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cprobe\u201d\nsystems count as measurements, and of how these interactions cause the\nprobe system to evolve into final \u201coutcome-states\u201d that\ncorrespond to\u2014and have the same probabilities as\u2014the\noutcomes predicted by the theory. This is the notorious\nmeasurement problem.\n\nIn fact, Putnam advanced his version of quantum-logical realism as\noffering a (radical) dissolution of the measurement problem: According\nto Putnam, the measurement problem (and indeed every other\nquantum-mechanical \u201cparadox\u201d) arises through an improper\napplication of the distributive law, and hence disappears\nonce this is recognized. This proposal, however, is widely regarded as\n mistaken.[4]\n\n\nAs mentioned above, realist interpretations of quantum mechanics must\nbe careful in how they construe the phrase \u201cthe observable \\(A\\)\nhas a value in the set \\(B\\)\u201d. The simplest and most traditional\nproposal\u2014often dubbed the \u201ceigenstate-eigenvalue\nlink\u201d (Fine [1973])\u2014is that (*) holds if and only if a\nmeasurement of \\(A\\) yields a value in the set \\(B\\) with certainty,\ni.e., with (quantum-mechanical!) probability 1. While this certainly\ngives a realist interpretation of\n (*),[5]\n it does not provide a solution to the measurement problem. Indeed, we\ncan use it to give a sharp formulation of that problem: even though\n\\(A\\) is certain to yield a value in \\(B\\) when measured, unless the\nquantum state is an eigenstate of the measured observable \\(A\\), the\nsystem does not possess any categorical property corresponding to\n\\(A\\)\u2019s having a specific value in the set \\(B\\). Putnam seems\nto assume that a realist interpretation of (*) should consist in\nassigning to \\(A\\) some unknown value within \\(B\\), for which quantum\nmechanics yields a non-trivial probability. However, an attempt to\nmake such assignments simultaneously for all observables runs afoul of\nGleason\u2019s\n Theorem.[6]\n",
