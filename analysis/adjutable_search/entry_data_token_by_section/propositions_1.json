Roles for Propositions: Modality\n\nIf there are propositions, they would appear to be good candidates for\nbeing the bearers of alethic modal properties (necessary and possible\ntruth), as well as the relata of entailment. And if\npropositions stand in entailment relations, then there would seem to\nbe maximal consistent sets of them. Prima facie, such sets seem to be\ngood candidates for possible worlds (Adams 1974; 1981). A proposition\nwill be true in a possible world (at a maximal consistent set of\npropositions) iff it is a member of that world.\n\nIf possible worlds are understood in this way, however, it is\nimportant to distinguish two meanings for talk of \u2018the actual\nworld\u2019. This may refer either to the totality of what exists, to\nwhat Lewis calls \u201cI and all my surroundings\u201d, or to the\nmaximal consistent set which includes all the true propositions. The\nlatter is part of I and all my surroundings, but only a proper\npart.\n",
