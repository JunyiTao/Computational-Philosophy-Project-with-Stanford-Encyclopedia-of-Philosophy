    "main_text": "Equality of Opportunity in Practice\n9. Equality of Opportunity in Practice\n\nIn\n section 2,\n we saw that Equality of Opportunity can be understood in deontic or\ntelic terms. To recall, a deontic view of Equality of Opportunity is\nprimarily concerned with processes and decisions by which goods or\npositions are allocated, whereas a telic view is concerned with\npersons\u2019 enjoyment of equal opportunities as a matter of the\noverall state of affairs. Rawls\u2019 conception of FEO, for example,\nexplicitly combines both deontic and telic elements. It includes a\ndeontic requirement that offices and positions are to be distributed\naccording to the talents and willingness to work of those competing\nfor such positions (a meritocratic conception, or, as Rawls calls it,\nformal equality of opportunity), and it includes a telic principle\nthat persons ought to enjoy conditions which provide them with a fair\nchance to compete under those terms. LE is most naturally understood\nas a telic ideal, given that it evaluates how a person fares overall\nin comparison with others. It is possible to conceive of LE as a\ndeontic approach, however. Such an approach might specify allocative\nrequirements as being those which, if adhered to, would best\ninstantiate LE outcomes (Segall 2013). Even so, because LE is\nconcerned with persons\u2019 levels of overall advantage, any\nprinciples regulating the allocation of jobs and positions\nspecifically would either be insufficient to ensure LE Equality of\nOpportunity (because only jobs and positions, along with their\nattendant rewards, would be allocated), or they would need to take\ninto account wider sources of inequality.\n\nThis points us in the direction of a tension between telic and deontic\nconsiderations of Equality of Opportunity. To take Rawls\u2019 FEO as\nan illustration, we can see that the deontic element\u2014that\noffices and positions should be allocated according to meritocratic\nprinciples\u2014is separable from the telic element\u2014that\npersons should enjoy a fair chance to compete for social advantages.\nThese elements can come apart in different ways. A society could offer\nan equal chance for social advantage whilst violating the meritocratic\nprinciple. Suppose we have a society sharply divided along racialized\nlines but in a way that is equal between groups. Members of each\nracialized group are systematically discriminated against in hiring\npractices, but this balances out overall to give each citizen no\nlesser chance than others at competing for social advantage. Though\nfanciful, this illustrates how meritocratic considerations are\nimportantly distinct from, and only contingently related to, the issue\nof equal prospects for success overall. If we object to the racialized\ndiscrimination in a case like this, it suggests that our reasons for\nobjecting to it are not reducible to its liability to create\ninequalities in life chances (though we may not be objecting to it\nqua being discrimination; Segall 2013: 122). More\nrealistically, a society could instantiate meritocratic hiring\npractices without giving citizens a relevantly fair chance to\ncompete.\n\nThis second scenario provokes a further important question: namely,\nhow should deontic principles of Equality of Opportunity be applied in\ncontexts where telic Equality of Opportunity is imperfectly\ninstantiated? (For some reflections, see Joseph Fishkin 2014:\n56\u201365.) For instance, when society fails to ensure that persons\nhave a fair chance to compete for offices and positions, should hiring\npractices be adjusted in light of this, or not (Clayton 2012)? Suppose\nsociety manifests substantial class inequality which leads to\nsystematic differences between children from the prosperous class and\na poor class when it comes to their prospects of success in an\nemployment market that is regulated by meritocratic principles.\nChildren from the prosperous class have a much greater chance at\nobtaining the qualifications that will help secure them the advantaged\npositions. Suppose that those inequalities remain unaddressed by\ndirect means (for instance, the redistribution of wealth or education\nreforms).\n\nOne measure here would be to institute workplace adaptations to offset\ndisadvantages. That is, the available range of jobs could be\nreconstituted to ensure that advantaged positions depend less on the\ntalents that are cultivated by the prosperous social class and depend\non traits that are more evenly distributed across the social spectrum.\nThis would be consistent with adhering to principles of meritocratic\nEquality of Opportunity. Competitive hiring would still be decided by\na \u201cbest qualified\u201d criteria, but the range of relevant\nqualifications is simply changed to counter unfair inequalities in\naccess to the jobs. This measure might seem to have limited mileage,\nhowever (although for a related proposal in a sporting context, albeit\nin response to natural physiological differences, see English 1978).\nQuite apart from the fact that there might be reasons of efficiency\nfor organizing the workplace in certain ways rather than others, it is\nalso likely that the sources of social inequality in a society divided\nalong class lines would be responsive to changes in how the workplace\nis organized. If families in prosperous social classes are intent on\nfunnelling resources into their children\u2019s development to give\nthem the highest chances of success, their money will simply follow\nwhichever set of qualifications happen to do that.\n\nSometimes social advantage can allow people to gain qualifications\nwhich advantage them in competitive applications, even though those\nqualifications are not necessarily reflective of higher underlying\ntalent or ability. For a stark illustration of this, suppose that\nchildren of wealthy families can gain preferential access to\nprestigious and high calibre universities, and that, whilst there,\nthey are given lenient grading given the quality of their work. They\nreach the job market with exceptionally strong qualifications\u2014in\nthe sense that their educational portfolio is strong\u2014even though\nthis is not an accurate reflection of their underlying ability. In the\ncontext of advantages of this kind\u2014where social advantage buys\n\u201csurface qualifications\u201d, rather than enhancing\n\u201ctalent for the job\u201d\u2014it might be that some degree of\nunfair inequality in the competition for social advantage can be\noffset by ensuring that hiring and admissions practices consistently\nadmit those with the highest underlying ability (and effort), rather\nthan those who have the best \u201csurface qualifications\u201d.\n\nAn example may help to illustrate. Take a competitive application for\na degree course in mathematics. Suppose the criteria for being\n\u201cbest qualified\u201d for selection is the level of aptitude at\nmaths that the student will reach at the end of the course. The\nuniversity begins with a selection procedure that uses school grades\nas the sole appropriate indicator as to which candidate is best\nqualified in that sense. It might be that school grades are an\nimperfect indicator because less well-qualified students from more\nprosperous backgrounds are able to go to schools which successfully\nallow them to get high grades, even though this does not necessarily\nreflect their superior underlying ability in maths. One measure the\nuniversity might take to apply the \u201cbest qualified\u201d\ncriteria more accurately, then, might be to design a maths test which\nmore accurately discriminates between candidates based on underlying\nability than school grades do.\n\nThis would not necessarily be a compromise of the meritocratic\nconception of Equality of Opportunity, but a requirement to apply it\nmore accurately. For instance, it could be that using \u201csurface\nqualifications\u201d is a useful proxy for identifying underlying\nability and is otherwise more efficient than implementing a more\naccurate, but also more costly, procedure. Offsetting this source of\nunequal chances may involve requiring institutions like firms and\nuniversities to invest additional resources in more accurate\nprocedures.\n\nAlternatively, it might be argued that to counter the lack of equal\nchances for members of socially disadvantaged groups, we should depart\nfrom meritocratic principles in hiring and admissions. For instance, a\nquota system might be used to require the inclusion of members of\ncertain disadvantaged groups, even though they may be less qualified\nthan non-members (Mason 2006: 19, 78 ; Mason 2001: 767).This is\nimportantly different from the above thought that measures might be\ntaken to discount the social advantages that some have when it comes\nto portraying themselves as ultimately best qualified. It is not\nsimply a matter of eliminating the social advantages some candidates\nhave concerning how successfully they can navigate the competitive\nprocedures (for instance, through better qualifications on paper) but\nit is a matter of saying that members of certain groups should get an\nadvantage over those who are in fact better qualified for the\nposition. In the case of applications to study maths at university,\nfor instance, it could be that children from more prosperous\nbackgrounds receive an education that not only gives them better\ngrades, but it also genuinely enhances their ability at maths. In this\ncase they are genuinely better qualified in the relevant sense, rather\nthan simply appearing to be, but their educational advantages could be\nsaid to give them an unfair chance in the competition to study maths\nat university. A quota system requiring that a greater proportion of\nstudents be admitted from less prosperous backgrounds would thereby\ninvolve compromising the deontic, meritocratic element of FEO in order\nto better satisfy the telic, fair chances element.\n\nA quota system of this kind might fall under the umbrella of measures\noften referred to as \u201caffirmative action\u201d or\n\u201cpositive discrimination\u201d, under which members of some\ngroups receive preferential treatment in the competition for roles and\npositions in a way that departs from meritocratic criteria (see the\nentry on\n affirmative action).\n This need not necessarily come in the form of a quota but could be\nsimply that membership of a certain group gives a candidate some\nadvantage in the competition, say, by simply giving some extra weight\nto those applications (Dworkin 2002b; Jacobs 2004: ch. 5). There are a\nrange of reasons offered for pursuing such measures. The measures\ncould be pursued to make the competition for scarce roles and\npositions fairer, as in the above example of admitting a greater\nproportion of children from less prosperous backgrounds to a maths\ncourse. They could be pursued as a matter of compensation for\nhistorical disadvantage (Nickel 1972; Thomson 1973; Valls 1999; for\ncriticism, see Anderson 2010: 137\u2013141; Lippert-Rasmussen 2020:\nch. 2; Sher 1975). The measures could be pursued to try to counteract\nwould-be unfair inequalities more generally, and not specifically to\nequalize chances for the members of the group who are being favoured.\nFor instance, it might be argued that by bolstering the numbers of\nindividuals from disadvantaged or marginalized groups in certain roles\nor jobs, this helps to facilitate access to those positions more\ngenerally, or to work against broader forms of injustice. Perhaps\nadmitting a larger proportion of children from underprivileged social\nbackgrounds into university helps encourage members of those groups to\nsee university as a realistic ambition when, because of past social\nconditions, it has not been considered attainable from their point of\nview (for discussion, see Thomson 1973: 367). Or perhaps increasing\nthe numbers of members of racialized minority groups in a workforce\nwill play some part in broader efforts to destigmatize racialized\ndifferences between groups. One thing worth noting about this\nrationale is that on a broad enough understanding of what makes\nsomeone \u201cbest qualified\u201d for a role it might be that such\nmeasures do not constitute a compromise of the meritocratic\nrequirement to select the best qualified after all (Anderson 2010: ch.\n7; Dworkin 2002a: 109). This might be the case if the relevant purpose\nof the role included these broader social effects.\n",
