    "main_text": "Bodily Practices || Disciplining the Body\n5.1 Disciplining the Body\n\nFeminist writers from Wollstonecraft onwards have drawn attention to\nthe way in which society prescribes norms in relation to which\nsubjects regulate their own bodies and those of others.\nBeauvoir\u2019s account of this has been highlighted above.\n\u201cOur bodies are trained, shaped and impressed with the\nprevailing historical forms of \u2026 masculinity and\nfemininity\u201d (Bordo 1993: 91). By regimes of dieting, makeup,\nexercise, dress, and cosmetic surgery, women, and increasingly men,\ntry to sculpt their bodies into shapes which reflect the dominant\nsocietal norms. Such disciplinary practices attach not only to the\nproduction of appropriately gendered bodies, but to other aspects of\nbodily identity subject to social normalization. Hair straightening,\nblue tinted contact lenses, surgical reconstruction of noses and lips,\nare practices in which the material shapes of our bodies are\ndisciplined to correspond to a social ideal, reflecting the privileged\nposition which certain kinds of, usually, white, always able, always\nyoung, bodies occupy.\n\nThis became a major theme in 1970s feminist writing. Dworkin writes:\n\n\n\nIn our culture not one part of a women\u2019s body is left untouched,\nunaltered.\u2026 From head to toe, every feature of a woman\u2019s\nface, every section of her body, is subject to modification. (1974:\n113\u2013114) \n\n\nFrom the 1990s, feminist attention to the power relations\nworking through such disciplinary practices has made extensive use of\nthe work of Foucault (Foucault 1975, Bartky 1990, Bordo 1993).\nFoucauldian insights regarding disciplinary practices of the body are\napplied to the disciplining of the gendered, and most insistently the\nfemale, body. Such accounts stress the way in which women actively\ndiscipline their own bodies not only to avoid social punishments, but\nalso to derive certain kinds of pleasure. There are two key features\nof such accounts. One stresses the way in which the material shape of\nbodies is modified by such practices. The second that such\nmodifications are a consequence of bodies carrying social meanings,\nsignalling within specific contexts, sexual desirability, or\navailability, or respectability, or participation in social groupings.\nWith attention to the work of Foucault and other poststructuralist\nwriters, also came the recognition that practices of bodily\nmodification could have multiple meanings, with disagreements over\nresponses to cosmetics, fashion and cosmetic surgery (Davis 1995, Alsop and Lennon 2018). It was against this\nbackground that Bordo (1993) developed her complex and influential\nreading of the anorexic body: \n\n\nfemale slenderness \u2026 has a wide range of sometimes\ncontradictory meanings \u2026 suggesting powerlessness \u2026 in\none context, autonomy and freedom in the next. (1993: 26; see the\nEthics of Embodiment,\n section 8,\n below) \n\n",
