    "main_text": "Social-Political Philosophy || Feminism\n4. Aesthetics\n\nRand holds that our actions need guidance by a vision of the\nfundamental nature of the universe and of the efficacy of human\nthought and activity\u2014a vision that can be grasped directly\nrather than requiring the conscious repetition of long chains of\nabstract reasoning. The chief function of art is to meet this\npsychological need by expressing abstract conceptual values and\nmetaphysical truths in concrete perceptible form. Art, according to\nRand, constitutes a selective, stylized re-creation of reality, with\nthe principle of selection being the artist\u2019s \u201csense of\nlife\u201d, a set of implicit \u201cmetaphysical\nvalue-judgments\u201d, i.e., judgments about what is fundamentally\nsignificant about the world and our place in it. (There is controversy\namong Rand scholars as to whether what is re-created in art is certain\nelements of reality or reality as a whole, i.e., a\n\u201cmicrocosm\u201d, as well as how and whether the concept of\nre-creation applies to apparently non-representational forms of art:\nTorres and Kamhi 2000; Bissell 2004.) Both the artist\u2019s creative\nwork and the audience\u2019s emotional responses to it are driven by\ntheir senses of life, that is, the worldviews they have \u201cformed\nby a process of emotional generalization \u2026 a subconscious\ncounterpart of a process of abstraction\u201d (1966b: 27). The role\nof art in sustaining us psychologically by providing a concretization\nof our most fundamental values is a frequent theme in Rand\u2019s\nfiction as well, especially The\n Fountainhead.[12]\n\nWhile art can be used to convey information or to advocate a position,\nsuch functions are secondary to its chief task: providing an object\nwhose mere contemplation brings spiritual fulfillment. Hence Rand does\nnot regard her own novels primarily as vehicles for her philosophy,\nthough of course they are that inter alia. Given her own\nworldview, Rand favors literature with a strong plot as a way of\nexpressing purposeful human action in a world of causal regularity,\nand stories involving value-conflicts as a way of expressing the\nimportance of free choice; hence her preference for romantic (as\nopposed to, e.g., naturalistic) literature. But Rand holds that it is\npossible to evaluate an artwork\u2019s aesthetic value simply in\nterms of its success in conveying a concretization of the\nartist\u2019s sense of life, whether or not one shares the values and\njudgments so conveyed.\n",
