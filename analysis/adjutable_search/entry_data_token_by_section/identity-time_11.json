    "main_text": "Diachronic Identity Puzzles || Further Puzzle Cases\n4.7 Further Puzzle Cases\n\nWe have focused attention on one type of case that raises a puzzle\nabout diachronic identity. Such a case involves something ostensibly\nbecoming, or ceasing to be identical with something that is ostensibly\none of its earlier or later proper parts. It would be wrong to give\nthe impression that such a \u201cDeon-Theon\u201d case named after\nthe individuals involved in the example is the only, or even main,\ntype of case posing a problem about diachronic identity. In addition\nthere are what are often referred to as fission and fusion cases. A\nfission case has the following features. We have putatively distinct\nthings b and c existing at some later time\nt2. Each of b and c is related\nto a, which exists at an earlier time t1,\nin such a way that each one is ostensibly identical with\na.\n\nFission cases come in two varieties: symmetrical and asymmetrical.\nExamples of symmetrical fission cases include amoebic and hemispheric\ndivision [for the latter see Personal Identity below]. In a\nsymmetrical case there is some relation that each of b and\nc stand in to a, where standing in that relation is\nwhat makes each one putatively identical with a. In an\nasymmetric case, b is putatively identical with a because it\nstands in a certain relation to a, but c is\nputatively identical with a because it stands in a different\nrelation to a. The best known example of a symmetrical\nfission case is the Ship of Theseus described at the beginning of this\nsection.\n\nLet us see how the proposals for dealing with the cup case apply to\nfission cases. Constitution only delivers a candidate solution in a\nsymmetric fission case. As we noted above, a constitution theorist can\nsay the following about Theseus' Ship. The ship resulting from the\nreplacement of the original planks is identical with, but not\nconstituted from the original planks. The ship reconstituted from the\noriginal planks is not identical with the one originally constituted\nfrom those planks.\n\nSome relative identity theorists have this to say about Theseus' Ship.\nIn that case conflict with the transitivity of identity is avoided by\nmaintaining the following. The replacement ship is the same ship as\nthe original, and the original is the same collection of planks as the\nreassembly ship. Conflict with transitivity is avoided because we need\nnot allow that the reassembly ship is the same ship as the\noriginal.\n\nDistinguishing between a strict and loose sense of\n\u2018identical\u2019 yields the following solution in the case of\nTheseus' Ship. Let Original be the original ship, Replacement be the\nship that results from replacing Original's original planks, and\nReassembly the one that results from their reassembly. In that case,\ndeploying the distinction between a strict and loose sense of\nidentity, we can say this. Reassembly is strictly identical with\nOriginal, but Replacement is only loosely identical with Original. A\nconflict with transitivity of identity is avoided for the following\nreason. It follows by transitivity from Replacement being identical\nwith Original, and Original being identical with Reassembly, that\nReplacement is identical with Reassembly only if a single relation of\nidentity is involved.\n\nHere is what a four dimensionalist such as Lewis will say about\nTheseus' ship. In that case there are two initially indiscernible\nships. The first is a four dimensionally extended ship located where\nthe original ship is initially located that ends up coinciding only\nwith the reassembly ship. The second, also initially located where the\noriginal ship is initially ends up coinciding with the replacement\nship. We thus have a Y-branching four dimensionally extended object\nwith one ship constituted by the stem together with one branch, and\nthe other constituted by the stem together with the remaining\nbranch.\n\nFour Dimensionalism, like the thesis that identities can be temporary,\napplies to both symmetric and asymmetric cases of fission.\n\nA temporary identity theorist will hold that Replacement and\nReassembly are identical at t1, but distinct ships\nat t2.\n\nIn the previous section we reviewed an argument designed to rule out\nindeterminate identities. If that argument can be met, it is open to\nus to say the following about Theseus' Ship. Each of Replacement and\nReassembly is indeterminately identical with Original.\n\nThe puzzle cases are puzzle cases because they bring into putative\nconflict intuitions all of which we want to subscribe to. Consider a\nstatue and the collection of atoms that constitute it. We wish to say\nthat the statue is identical with the collection of atoms. We also\nwish to say that the statue, but not the collection, can survive the\nloss of one atom belonging to that collection. Leibniz's Law appears\nto force us to renounce one of these intuitions. Thomas Sattig argues\nfor a compatibilist view according to which we can hold on to both\nintuitions without giving up, or modifying, Leibniz's Law. We can do\nso by relativising identities to different perspectives. From the\nordinary object perspective the statue is distinct from the atoms that\nconstitute it. From the material object perspective the statue is\nidentical with the atoms that constitute it.\n",
