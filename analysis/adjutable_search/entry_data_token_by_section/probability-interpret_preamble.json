    "main_text": "\n\nProbability is the most important concept in modern science,\nespecially as nobody has the slightest notion what it means.\n\u2014Bertrand Russell, 1929 Lecture\n\n(cited in Bell 1945, 587)\n\n\nOne regularly reads and hears probabilistic claims like the following:\n\nThe Democrats will probably win the next election.\nThe coin is just as likely to land heads as tails.\nThere\u2019s a 30% chance of rain tomorrow.\nThe probability that a radium atom decays in one year is roughly\n0.0004.\n\n\nBut what do these statements mean? This may be understood as a\nmetaphysical question about what kinds of things are probabilities, or\nmore generally as a question about what makes probability statements\ntrue or false. At a first pass, various interpretations of\nprobability answer this question, one way or another.\n\nHowever, there is also a stricter usage: an\n\u2018interpretation\u2019 of a formal theory provides\nmeanings for its primitive symbols or terms, with an eye to turning\nits axioms and theorems into true statements about some subject. In\nthe case of probability, Kolmogorov\u2019s axiomatization (which we\nwill see shortly) is the usual formal theory, and the so-called\n\u2018interpretations of probability\u2019 usually interpret\nit. That axiomatization introduces a function\n\u2018\\(P\\)\u2019 that has certain formal properties. We may then\nask \u2018What is \\(P\\)?\u2019. Several of the views that we will\ndiscuss also answer this question, one way or another.\n\nOur topic is complicated by the fact that there are various\nalternative formalizations of probability. Moreover, as we will see,\nsome of the leading \u2018interpretations of probability\u2019 do\nnot obey all of Kolmogorov\u2019s axioms, yet they have not\nlost their title for that. And various other quantities that have\nnothing to do with probability do satisfy Kolmogorov\u2019s\naxioms, and thus are \u2018interpretations\u2019 of it in the strict\nsense: normalized mass, length, area, volume, and other quantities\nthat fall under the scope of measure theory, the abstract mathematical\ntheory that generalizes such quantities. Nobody seriously considers\nthese to be \u2018interpretations of probability\u2019, however,\nbecause they do not play the right role in our conceptual\napparatus.\n\nPerhaps we would do better, then, to think of the interpretations as\nanalyses of various concepts of probability. Or perhaps\nbetter still, we might regard them as explications of such\nconcepts, refining them to be fruitful for philosophical and\nscientific theorizing (\u00e0 la Carnap 1950, 1962).\n\nHowever we think of it, the project of finding such interpretations is\nan important one. Probability is virtually ubiquitous. It plays a role\nin almost all the sciences. It underpins much of the social sciences\n\u2014 witness the prevalent use of statistical testing, confidence\nintervals, regression methods, and so on. It finds its way, moreover,\ninto much of philosophy. In epistemology, the philosophy of mind, and\ncognitive science, we see states of opinion being modeled by\nsubjective probability functions, and learning being modeled by the\nupdating of such functions. Since probability theory is central to\ndecision theory and game theory, it has ramifications for ethics and\npolitical philosophy. It figures prominently in such staples of\nmetaphysics as causation and laws of nature. It appears again in the\nphilosophy of science in the analysis of confirmation of theories,\nscientific explanation, and in the philosophy of specific scientific\ntheories, such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics,\nevolutionary biology, and genetics. It can even take center stage in\nthe philosophy of logic, the philosophy of language, and the\nphilosophy of religion. Thus, problems in the foundations of\nprobability bear at least indirectly, and sometimes directly, upon\ncentral scientific, social scientific, and philosophical concerns. The\ninterpretation of probability is one of the most important such\nfoundational problems.\n",
