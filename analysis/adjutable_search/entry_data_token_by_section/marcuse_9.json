    "main_text": "Psychoanalysis and Utopian Vision || Fantasy, Utopia, and the Rationality of Gratification\n4.5  Fantasy, Utopia, and the Rationality of Gratification\n\n\nWhile the first half of Eros and Civilization does not sound\nany more optimistic than the conclusion of Freud\u2019s\nCivilization and its Discontents, it does move from diagnosis\nto prognosis or from critique to hope. At the diagnostic level,\nMarcuse examines the form of social pathology that permeates advanced\nindustrial societies. The conclusion is that capitalism demands a\nlevel of surplus repression that supports the development of the death\ninstinct and social domination. However, repression is never\ncomplete. Even Freud was aware of the incompleteness of repression in\na 1915 essay simply entitled \u201cRepression\u201d. Both Freud and\nMarcuse recognize that repressed instincts never go away, but continue\nto assert themselves in one way or another. The erotic drive, which is\nthe builder of culture, continues to assert itself in its conflict\nwith the death instinct. According to Marcuse, the erotic drive for\nhappiness and pleasure lives on in fantasies, art, and utopian\nvisions.\n\nThe second half of Eros and Civilization is devoted to the\nwork of fantasy and the imagination. Marcuse builds a case for the\nemancipatory function of the imagination by reconstructing Freud,\nKant, Schiller, and others. His main point is that through the\nimagination we can envision a better world. This is not a blind\nutopian vision insofar as the resources for creating a qualitatively\nbetter form of life already exists. At the prognostic level, Marcuse\nargues for a fusion of Logos and Eros. This fusion\nhe refers to as the \u201crationality of\ngratification\u201d (Marcuse 1955: 224). Here, the struggle for\nexistence is based on co-operation and free development and\nfulfillment of needs. \n\nAlthough Eros and Civilization is one of Marcuse\u2019s\nmore optimistic works and offered a new and radical interpretation\nof Freud, it is not without controversy. Marcuse\u2019s\nattempt to make Freud\u2019s drive theory central to an emancipatory\ncritical theory drew criticisms from several sources. I will\ndiscuss the response by some feminists in a later section. \n\nIn an Epilogue to Eros and Civilization entitled\n\u201cCritique of Neo-Freudian Revisionism\u201d, Marcuse accuses\nseveral prominent psychoanalysts of revising Freud\u2019s work in such\na way that it is purged of its critical implications. These\nrevisionists use psychoanalysis to develop a conformist psychology\nrather than a critical one. This led to an open debate between\nMarcuse and a former member of the Institute, Erich Fromm. The\ndebate took place in the mid 1950s in the journal Dissent. \nMarcuse believed that Fromm and others had rejected some of\nFreud\u2019s key insights such as his libidinal theory, the death\ninstinct, the Oedipus complex, the primal horde of patricides,\netc.\n\n The essential problem for Marcuse, was that as the years went by,\nFromm moved further and further away from the instinctual basis of\nhuman personality. He had instead embraced \u201cpositive thinking\nwhich leaves the negative where it is\u2014predominant over human\nexistence\u201d (Friedman 2013: 195). \n\nFromm\u2019s approach differed from Marcuse\u2019s insofar as he\nwas more concerned with the role that society played in shaping\none\u2019s character. This different approach does not mean that\nFromm has become less critical. Fromm is perhaps correct in his\nclaim that Marcuse misread him. Given Fromm\u2019s continued\ncommitment to Marxism, it is not likely that he would reduce\npsychoanalysis to a conformist psychology. What appears to be\npositive thinking in Fromm\u2019s work is really not far from what\nMarcuse was after himself in Eros and Civilization. That\nis, Fromm, in a way that differed from Marcuse, was attempting to\nrescue Eros, the builder of culture from the oppressive forces\nof capitalism. The Fromm/Marcuse debate represents an unfortunate\nmoment in the history of critical theory where two major thinkers spoke\nright past each other.   \n",
