The Specter of Liberation: The Great Refusal and the New Sensibility \n\n\nAlthough the form of critique in some of Marcuse\u2019s works and the\nuse of concepts such as one-dimensionality may cause one to read a bit\nof pessimism into Marcuse\u2019s texts, nothing could be more\nproblematic than such a reading. The social reality in advanced\nindustrial societies is that very sophisticated systems of domination\nare in place and they are capable of transforming themselves to meet\nthe challenge of any movement for liberation. However, as Marx and\nEngels warned in The Communist Manifesto, \u201cA specter is\nhaunting Europe\u2014the specter of communism\u201d (Marx and Engels\n1848 [1964]: 55). For Marcuse, the specter of liberation haunted\nadvanced industrial societies. One might even say that Marcuse\u2019s\nown critical theory was haunted by the specter of liberation. That is,\nat one level Marcuse engaged in a critique of oppressive social\nstructures so that the door for revolution and liberation could be\nopened. At another level, Marcuse modified his theory to make room for\nvarious form of resistance that he saw developing in oppressive\nsocieties. Marcuse was at once a teacher of revolutionary\nconsciousness and a student. \n\nAlthough he was called the guru of the student movements in the\n1960s, he rejected this title because he was also learning from these\nmovements. The hope for revolution lay within individuals who in\ntheir very being have grown weary with their own repression. The\nstudent movements of the 60s were not based on class struggle, but\nrather, a rejection of their own repression as well as a growing lack\nof tolerance for war and waste. In the Preface to An Essay on\nLiberation while reflecting on the student revolt of 1968, Marcuse\nsays:\n\n\nIn proclaiming the \u201cpermanent challenge,\u201d\n(la contestation permanente), the \u201cpermanent\neducation,\u201d the Great Refusal, they recognized the mark of social\nrepression, even in the most sublime manifestations of traditional\nculture, even in the most spectacular manifestations of technical\nprogress. They have again raised a specter (and this time a\nspecter which haunts not only the bourgeoisie but all exploitative\nbureaucracies): the specter of a revolution which subordinates the\ndevelopment of productive forces and higher standards of living to the\nrequirements of creating solidarity for the human species, for\nabolishing poverty and misery beyond all national frontiers and spheres\nof interest, for the attainment of peace. (Marcuse 1969: ix\u2013x)\n\nThe student protests of the 1960s were a form of Great Refusal, a\nsaying \u201cNO\u201d to multiple forms of repression and\ndomination. This Great Refusal demands a new/liberated\nsociety. This new society requires what Marcuse calls the new\nsensibility which is an ascension of the life instincts over the\naggressive instincts (Marcuse 1969: 23). This idea of a new\nsensibility is yet another move beyond Marxism insofar as it requires\nmuch more than new power relations. It requires the cultivation\nof new forms of subjectivity. Human subjectivity in its present\nform is the product of systems of domination. We rid society of\nits systems of domination by ridding it of the forms of subjectivity\nformed by those systems and replacing them with new forms of\nsubjectivity. This is why Marcuse was so interested in the\nfeminist movement. He saw in this movement the potential for\nradical social change. The process of rethinking femininity and\nmasculinity could be the beginning of redefining male subjectivity so\nthat it develops in a way that males become less aggressive. \n\nThe cultivation of a new sensibility would transform the\nrelationship between human beings and nature as well as the\nrelationships among human beings. The new sensibility is the\nmedium of social change that mediates between the political practice of\nchanging the world and one\u2019s own drive for personal liberation\n(Marcuse 2007: 234).\n",
