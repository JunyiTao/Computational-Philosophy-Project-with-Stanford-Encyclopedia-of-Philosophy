    "main_text": "A complete worldview: metaphysics, taxonomies, cosmology || The universe as seen by the omniscient ones\n2.5 The universe as seen by the omniscient ones\n\nFurthermore, Jaina authors believe that the life of the universe is a\nprocess without beginning nor end, that passes through an ongoing\nseries of cosmic cycles, each of which is billions of years in\nduration. The question of an origin and end of the universe does not\narise, since the latter is eternal. What matters is the transition\nbetween two types of periods. The universe goes through a series of\ncycles, each of which lasts several billion years. The wheel of time\nexperiences one descending cycle, which passes through six periods\nduring which prosperity, happiness, and morality decline; and one\nascending cycle, which passes through six periods during which\nprosperity, happiness, and morality increase. These periods are\ncharacterized by the possibility\u2014respectively the\nimpossibility\u2014of individual liberation while they happen.\nIndeed, on one hand, it takes a minimum of suffering to want to engage\nin the path of liberation. and on the other hand, serenity must be\nsufficiently accessible to be able to properly engage in ascetic\npractices. On the day when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a left the earth, in\nthe third millennium BCE, after the great battle described in the\nThe Great [Epic of the Dynasty] of the Bh\u0101ratas\n(Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata), we entered into the fifth descending\nperiod of the cycle. It is therefore expected that things will go from\nbad to worse in our world for a few millennia before they get better\nagain. This means that it is no longer possible to achieve\nenlightenment in the current period, because the world order is too\nunstable.\n\nWe started this entry by stating that the Jains are those who consider\nthat the teachings of the omniscient Jinas are the expression of the\neternal essential nature of the universe, and that the only extant\nteaching is that of Mah\u0101v\u012bra \u201cthe Great Hero\u201d\n(traditional dates 599\u2013527/510 BCE), the twenty-fourth and last\nJina of the current cosmic period. Mah\u0101v\u012bra is an older\ncontemporary of the Buddha and has a biography very close to that of\nthe latter. Notably, he left his royal family, became an ascetic and\nfounded a community made of mendicant ascetics and lay followers. One\nnotable difference being that he follows a tradition that was existing\nlong before him.\n\nSo, at every cosmic cycle, the doctrine is taught by 24 such\nomniscient Jinas. These are also called\n\u201ct\u012brtha\u1e45kara\u201d (ford makers). Since\nVedic times, a t\u012brtha refers to holy spots in shallow\nwaters, where people perform acts of devotion, especially bathing,\nwhich is considered as purifying sins. These shallow waters can also\nbe a crossing place symbolizing the junction between mundane world and\nsacred realm. In this line, a t\u012brtha\u1e45kara is a\nspiritual pioneer able to cross beyond the perpetual flow of earthly\nlife and, as such, he or she (they do not have a sexual identity at\nthis stage) acts as a model mediating the passage between a mundane\nstate of our selves and a state of unobstructed consciousness in act.\nIt is important to notice that these liberated beings know all, but\nare by essence unable to influence the course of action of the world,\nsince they do not have intentions and that they are radically isolated\nfrom anything else.\n\nBesides, after Mah\u0101v\u012bra\u2019s liberation, liberation is\nnot possible anymore in our realm for cosmic reasons. However, there\nare other realms, in which gods and demons notably live. Jainas have\ndeveloped a complex model of the universe (Dundas 2005). Canonical\nliterature (3rd century BCE\u20146th century\nCE) already includes description of the universe, but it is between\nthe 3rd and the 13th centuries CE that\nspecialized texts specifically dedicated to cosmography are composed,\namongst them, the influential Compendium of Middle Earth\n(Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpasa\u1e43graha\u1e47\u012b [JDS]) of\nHaribhadra S\u016bri (770 CE). There, the universe is described as\nbeing constituted of two parts. On one hand, the world\n(loka), extremely vast, but finite, is occupied by living\nbeings and by things; on the other hand, the rest (aloka)\nsurrounds the world with its infinite and empty space.\n\nThe inhabited world is made of a succession of island-continents,\noceans, hells and paradises. It measures the distance traveled by a\ngod who flies for six months at a speed of sixteen million kilometers\nper second. In this world, human beings live only in Middle-earth,\nalso called the Island-Continent of the Rose Apple Tree\n(Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa). Middle Earth is, as its name\nsuggests, central. Its surface is extremely small compared to the rest\nof the world. The different parts of the universe are defined in\nrelation to the possibility\u2014respectively the\nimpossibility\u2014of liberation therein and the region of Middle\nEarth is the only region from which it is possible to achieve\nliberation. Such a representation is conducive to remember the rare\nand central character of human birth, which alone can lead to\nliberation. Moreover, the extent and complexity of the whole is a\nconstant reminder of the skills of the omniscient Jinas who were able\nto teach such a system.\n\nAround the 16th c., the world is presented in the form of a\nhuman being, thus emphasizing the similarities between the structure\nof the world and the inner struggle faced by each individual.\nMoreover, the extremely detailed depiction of the world provides a\nbackdrop, both for the initiation tales of pious Jains found in\nnarrative literature, and for meditative practices, some of which\ninvolve the contemplation of a holy object. Ultimately, the precision\nwith which the authors describe the world allowed Jainism to stand out\nmore clearly from other worldviews. Indeed, only the values of Jainism\nprevail in these descriptions of the universe. In this sense, the\nuniverse thus represented becomes an emblem of religious identity, as\nwell as a guide to religious practice, because, above all else, the\nJaina world is the abode of beings on the path of liberation (Dundas\n2005).\n",
