    "main_text": "A Brief History\n1. A Brief History\n\nIn principle, anyone denying the existence of some type of thing is an\neliminativist with regard to that type of thing. Thus, there have been\na number of eliminativists about different aspects of human nature in\nthe history of philosophy. For example, hard determinists like\n Holbach\n (1770) are eliminativists with regard to free will because they claim\nthere is no dimension of human psychology that corresponds to our\ncommonsense notion of freedom. Similarly, by denying that there is an\nego or persisting subject of experience,\n Hume\n (1739) was arguably an eliminativist about the self. Reductive\nmaterialists can be viewed as eliminativists with respect to an\nimmaterial soul.\n\nNevertheless, contemporary eliminative materialism\u2014the sort of\neliminativism that denies the existence of specific types of mental\nstates\u2014is a relatively new theory with a very short history. The\nterm was first introduced by James Cornman in a 1968 article entitled\n\u201cOn the Elimination of \u2018Sensations\u2019 and\nSensations\u201d (Cornman, 1968). However, the basic idea goes back\nat least as far as C.D. Broad\u2019s classic, The Mind and its\nPlace in Nature (Broad, 1925). Here Broad discusses, and quickly\nrejects, a type of \u201cpure materialism\u201d that treats mental\nstates as attributes that apply to nothing in the world (pp.\n607\u2013611). Like many future writers (see section 4.1 below),\nBroad argued that such a view is self-contradictory since it\n(presumably) presupposes the reality of misjudgments which are\nthemselves a type of mental state.\n\nApart from Broad\u2019s discussion, the main roots of eliminative\nmaterialism can be found in the writings of a number of mid-20th\ncentury philosophers, most notably\n Wilfred Sellars,\n W.V.O. Quine,\n Paul Feyerabend,\n and\n Richard Rorty.\n In his important 1956 article, \u201cEmpiricism and the Philosophy\nof Mind\u201d, Sellars introduced the idea that our conception of\nmentality may be derived not from direct access to the inner workings\nof our own minds, but instead from a primitive theoretical framework\nthat we inherit from our culture. While Sellars himself regarded this\ntheoretical framework as empirically correct, his claim that our\nconception of the mind is theory-based, and at least in principle\nfalsifiable, would be influential to later supporters of\neliminativism.\n\nIn articles such as \u201cMental Events and the Brain\u201d (1963),\nPaul Feyerabend explicitly endorsed the idea that common-sense\npsychology might prove to be radically false. Indeed, Feyerabend held\nthat practically any version of materialism would severely undermine\ncommon-sense psychology. Like many of his contemporaries, Feyerabend\nargued that common-sense mental notions are essentially non-physical\nin character. Thus, for him, any form of physicalism would entail that\nthere are no mental processes or states as understood by common-sense\n(1963, p. 295).\n\nLike Feyerabend, Quine also endorsed the idea that mental notions like\nbelief or sensation could simply be abandoned in favor of a more\naccurate physiological account. In a brief passage in Word and\nObject (1960), Quine suggests that terms denoting the physical\ncorrelates of mental states will be more useful and, as he puts it,\n\u201c[t]he bodily states exist anyway; why add the others?\u201d\n(p. 264). However, Quine goes on to question just how radical an\neliminativist form of materialism would actually be, implying no\nsignificant difference between explicating mental states as\nphysiological states, and eliminating mental state terms in favor of\nphysical state terms. He asks, \u201cIs physicalism a repudiation of\nmental objects after all, or a theory of them? Does it repudiate the\nmental state of pain or anger in favor of its physical concomitant, or\ndoes it identify the mental state with a state of the physical\norganism (and so a state of the physical organism with the mental\nstate)\u201d (p. 265)? Quine answers this question by rejecting it,\nsuggesting there is no interesting difference between the two cases:\n\u201cSome may therefore find comfort in reflecting that the\ndistinction between an eliminative and an explicative physicalism is\nunreal\u201d (p. 265).\n\nHere we see a tension that runs throughout the writings of many early\neliminative materialists. The problem involves a vacillation between\ntwo different conditions under which mental concepts and terms are\ndropped. The first scenario proposes that certain mental concepts will\nturn out to be empty, with mental state terms referring to nothing\nthat actually exists. Historical analogs for this way of understanding\neliminativism are cases where we (now) say it turned out there are no\nsuch things, such as demons and crystal spheres. The second scenario\nsuggests that the conceptual framework provided by neurosciences (or\nsome other physical account) can or should come to replace the\ncommon-sense framework we now use. Unlike the first scenario, the\nsecond allows that mental state terms may actually designate something\nreal\u2014it\u2019s just that what they designate turn out to be\nbrain states, which will be more accurately described using the\nterminology of the relevant sciences. One possible model for this way\nof thinking about eliminativism might be the discontinuance of talk\nabout germs in favor of more precise scientific terminology of\ninfectious agents. Given these two different conceptions, early\neliminativists would sometimes offer two different characterizations\nof their view: (a) There are no mental states, just brain\nstates and, (b) There really are mental states, but they are\njust brain states (and we will come to view them that way).\n\nThese alternative ways of understanding eliminative materialism\nproduced considerable confusion about what, exactly, eliminative\nmaterialism entailed. Moreover, since it was difficult to see how the\nsecond version was significantly different from various forms of\nreductive materialism (hence, Quine\u2019s skepticism about the\ndifference between elimination and explication) it also raised doubts\nabout the distinctiveness of eliminative materialism.\n\nMuch of this was brought to light in the discussion generated by an\ninfluential 1965 article by Richard Rorty entitled, \u201cMind-Body\nIdentity, Privacy, and Categories\u201d. Rorty\u2019s so-called\n\u201cdisappearance\u201d theory appeared to openly endorse both\nconceptions of eliminative materialism, suggesting that sensations do\nnot actually exist and that they are nothing but brain processes (p.\n28). As one might expect, the ensuing discussion focused on getting\nclear on what Rorty\u2019s theory actually claimed (for doubts about\nRorty\u2019s status as a true eliminative materialist, see Ramsey\n(forthcoming)). For example, Cornman\u2019s article introducing the\nphrase \u2018eliminative materialism\u2019 claimed that Rorty was\narguing that talk about sensations denotes brain states in much the\nsame way that talk about Zeus\u2019s thunderbolts (allegedly) denotes\nelectrical discharges. Unfortunately, besides suggesting a\nquestionable perspective on reference, this interpretation raised\nfurther questions about what distinguished eliminativism from\nreductionism. In one helpful article by William Lycan and George\nPappas (1972)\u2014entitled, appropriately enough, \u201cWhat Is\nEliminative Materialism?\u201d\u2014the authors convincingly argued\nthat you can\u2019t have it both ways. You can either claim that\ncommon sense mental notions do not pick out anything real and that\nmental terms are empty, in which case you are a true eliminative\nmaterialist; or you can claim that mental notions can be, in some way,\nreduced to neurological (or perhaps computational) states of the\nbrain, in which case you are really just a good-old fashioned\nmaterialist/reductionist. In a follow-up article, Steven Savitt (1974)\nintroduced the distinction between ontologically conservative\n(reductive) and ontologically radical (eliminative) theory change,\nwhich helped to further clarify and distinguish the central claims of\neliminative materialism as it is understood today.\n\nIn more recent history, eliminative materialism has received attention\nfrom a broader range of writers, including many concerned not only\nwith the metaphysics of the mind, but also the process of theory\nchange, the status of semantic properties, the nature of psychological\nexplanation and recent developments in\n cognitive science.\n Much of this attention has been fostered by the husband-wife team of\nPaul and Patricia Churchland, whose writings have forced many\nphilosophers and cognitive scientists to take eliminativism more\nseriously. In his 1981 article, \u201cEliminative Materialism and the\nPropositional Attitudes\u201d, Paul Churchland presents several\narguments in favor of dropping commonsense psychology that have shaped\nthe modern debate about the status of ordinary notions like belief.\nPatricia Churchland\u2019s provocative 1986 book,\nNeurophilosophy, suggests that developments in neuroscience\npoint to a bleak future for commonsense mental states. Another\ninfluential author has been Stephen Stich. His important 1983 book,\nFrom Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science: The Case Against\nBelief, argues that even conventional\n computational psychology\u2014which\n is often assumed to vindicate common-sense\npsychology\u2014should reject taxonomies for cognitive states that\ncorrespond with belief-desire psychology. These authors\u2019 views\nare discussed in more detail in Sections 3 and 4 below.\n",
