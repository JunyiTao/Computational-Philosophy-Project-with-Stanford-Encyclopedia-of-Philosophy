    "main_text": "History || Sellars\u2019 Conception of We-Intention\n2.3 Sellars\u2019 Conception of We-Intention\n\nWhereas the mainstream of present debate about collective\nintentionality probably has no direct roots in early social theory or\nphenomenology, Wilfrid Sellars\u2019 concept of we-intention is\nwidely acknowledged as the point of departure (Tuomela & Miller\n1988). We-intentions play a crucial role in Sellars\u2019 practical\nphilosophy. As we-attitudes, normative judgments can both express\npeople\u2019s attitudes, and have a claim to intersubjective\nvalidity. The concept of a we-intention thus bridges emotivism and\nintuitionism (Sellars 1974). We-intentions are attitudes, but at the\nsame time, they are not merely private, but involve a shared point of\nview from which the participants may critically assess each\nother\u2019s contributions.\n\nSellars argues that even though we-intentions are not private, they do\nnot involve a group mind. His view is that we-intentions are had by\nindividuals, but that they differ from individual intentions in their\nform. According to the taxonomy developed below, his is a mode-account\nof collective intentionality. Sellars\u2019 conception of\nwe-intention can be traced back to Robin G. Collingwood\u2019s\nNew Leviathan (1947), where Collingwood defines society as\n\n\n\nthe sharing of certain persons in a practical social consciousness\nverbally expressed in a formula like \u2018We will go for this\nwalk\u2019 or \u2018We will sail this boat\u2019. (Collingwood\n1947: 146) \n\n\nIn a chapter by the title \u201cSociety as joint will\u201d,\nCollingwood argues that there is nothing mysterious about practical\nsocial consciousness (148). All the individual participant needs to\nhave is a however vague general idea of the enterprise as a whole, and\na special idea of the part in it allotted to himself. In addition, the\nparticipant must know that there are other agents who are partners\nwith him- or herself in this common endeavor, without having to know\nwho exactly they are. As \u201csocial consciousness,\u201d\nsociety\n\n\nis nothing over and above its members. It has no will but the will of\nits members; no activity but the activity of its members; no\nresponsibility but the responsibility of its members. (149ff.).\n\n\nSellars\u2019 interests differ from Collingwood\u2019s, but his\nanalysis closely follows Collingwood\u2019s lines. Sellars agrees\nwith Collingwood that the attitude in question requires no group mind\ncapable of belief or intention over and above the heads of the\nparticipating individuals (Sellars 1968: 203). On this account, all\nintentionality involved in group intention and group action is had\nby individuals, but it is conceived as intentionality of a\nspecial sort, which Sellars calls \u201caction we-referential\nintention\u201d, or, in short, \u201cwe-intention\u201d. It is thus\nindividuals, and not a group, that intend a joint action\n(Sellars 1980: 98). This, however, leads Sellars to one of the deepest\nproblems in the analysis of collective practical intentionality. One\ncannot intend what one takes to be entirely beyond one\u2019s\nabilities, or beyond one\u2019s control (Sellars calls this the\n\u201c\u2018up to the agent\u2019ness\u201d [Sellars 1980: 98] of\nintention). Objects of intention are taken, by the agent, to be\n\u201cup to her\u201d, to some degree at least. How, then, can\nindividuals have we-intentions? It seems plausible to assume that the\nbehavior of each individual, insofar as it is an action, is up to that\nindividual him- or herself. An individual who has an\naction-we-referential intention, however, does not only intend his or\nher own behavior, but also the behavior of the other participants, and\nthis behavior is not up to him- or herself, but up to others. Thus\nwe-intention seems to be incompatible with the \u2018up to the\nagent\u2019-ness of intention.\n\nIn the current debate, this problem is sometimes bypassed by shifting\nfrom action-referential to propositional intentions. Michael Bratman\nanalyzes shared intentions in terms of \u201cintention,\nthat\u201d rather than \u201cintention to\u201d\n(in a closely related vein, Raimo Tuomela distinguishes action\nintentions from aim intentions in parts of his work, e.g., Tuomela\n2007: 84f.). To intend that the door be closed is different\nfrom intending to close the door in that in the former case,\nthe subject having that intention may differ from the subject of the\nintended action. Thus, the problem with we-referential intentions seems\nto disappear as soon as intention is conceived of in propositional\nrather than in action-referential terms. Sellars is fully aware of the\npossibility of that move: \n\n\nIt is important to see that I can not only intend to do something\nmyself, I can also intend that someone else do something, i.e., that\nit be the case that he does it. (Sellars 1968: 184) \n\n\nYet Sellars sees clearly that this apparent escape route is really a\ndead end, and again, he follows Collingwood, who argued that\nconsciousness, insofar it is practical, is not a matter of\n\u201cmaking up your mind that\u201d, but a matter of\n\u201cmaking up your mind to\u201d (Collingwood 1947: 139).\nTalk of \u201cintention that something be the case\u201d,\nSellars argues, may be grammatically correct, but it is understandable\nas talk of practical commitments only in virtue of its\nrelation to \u201cintention to\u201d. When spelled out, the\nintention that p is really the intention to make it the case\nthat p (Sellars 1968: 184). Thus, a person\u2019s intention\nthat \u201cwe\u201d do x, or that somebody else does\nx, is a practical commitment only as an action-referential\nintention (intention to): one intends to do whatever is\nnecessary to make it the case that we do x, or that somebody\nelse does x. This yields a solution to the problem (which\nSellars later calls \u201csuperficial\u201d). A person may simply\nassume that it is up to her what other people do because she takes\nherself to have an influence on these other people (Sellars\n1968: 188).\n\n\nThat we can influence people is as relevant to practical reasoning as\nthat we can influence sticks or stones. (Sellars 1980: 88)\n\n\nAn agent who intends to bring her influence on others to bear in such\na way as to make it the case that others do what is necessary for the\nintended state to obtain, however, does not have a proper\nwe-intention. The reason is that such intentionality does not go\nbeyond an egocentric perspective; it involves an extension of the\nrange of one\u2019s own intentionality into other people\u2019s\nagency rather than any sense of sharing. Remember that Sellars\ndevelops the idea of we-intention with an eye on making the intuition\nthat normative judgments express intentional attitudes compatible with\nthe view that they involve a claim to intersubjective validity. Just\nthat I intend to influence other people to behave in a certain way, or\nto form certain intentions, does not make my attitude intersubjective\nin such a way as to provide a stance for mutual critical\nassessment.\n\nIn On Reasoning about Values (1980), Sellars offers\nan alternative solution to the \u2018up to the agent\u2019ness\nproblem of we-intention: it involves\n\n\nthe fact [\u2026] that to say that the intendible constituents of an\nintention are those which are present sub specie \u2018up to\nme\u2019 is equivalent to accompanying them with the conditional\n\u2018if it is up to me\u2019. [\u2026] Now \u2018up to me\u2019\nis the first-person form of \u2018up to X\u2019. [\u2026]\nThus, the correct answer to the above challenge consists in calling\nattention to the fact that the \u2018up to the agent\u2019ness of\naction we-referential intention is to be formulated as follows:\n\u2018Shall [each of us, if it is up to them, do\nA]\u2019 And this in no way requires that what others\ndo be up to me. (1980: 98) \n\n\nThus, Sellars\u2019 view is that when individuals we-intend to do\nsomething together, each one has his or her own we-intention.\n\u201c[T]he intendings are two in number, but the\ncontent of these intendings is the same\u201d\n(1968: 217).\n\nIn Sellars\u2019 view, we-intentions are intentions had by\nindividuals; we-intending individuals have their own\nintention, and the action intended by a we-intending agent is limited\nto what the agent takes to be up to him- or herself. This means that\nthe existence of we-intention does not imply that an intention is\nactually shared, an idea that resembles Searle\u2019s claim\nthat collective intentionality can be had by envatted brains (1990:\n406). This raises the question of what has to be the case for a\nwe-intending individual actually to intend together with\nothers. One person\u2019s we-intention does not make for a collective\nintention. Other we-intending individuals need to be around. But is it\nenough for an intention to be joint that other individuals happen to\nbe around who have a we-intention with the exact same content? If one\nbrain in a vat cannot we-intend alone, can two, if not\ntogether? How do the we-intentions of individual participants\nhave to be related to each other in order to constitute a\ngenuine collective intention? Sellars\u2019 analysis may not provide\na conclusive answer, but he presents at least two further insights\nthat seem highly relevant to the current debate.\n\nFirst, Sellars emphasizes the difference between two types of\nI-referential intentions. Primary I-referential intentions\nare different from we-derivative I-referential intentions in\nthat the content of the latter are contributions to joint actions. A\ngreat many intentions are we-derivative in that sense. My intention to\nmove a pawn on the chessboard is derivative from our intention to play\na game of chess.\n\nSecond, Sellars leaves ample room for what could be called\nintentional dissidence. Many current analyses assume that for\nus to intend x, each of us has to intend to do his or her\nshare. Sellars is keenly aware that this may not always be the case.\nIntentions may be ascribed to groups, as shared, without assuming that\neach participant intends to do his or her share. Yet Sellars\nacknowledges that the less of our collective intentions and beliefs an\nindividual shares, the more difficult it becomes to see him or her as\n\u201cone of us\u201d (Sellars 1968: 203). We-intentions are a\nmatter of a \u201cshared point of view\u201d that involves\nidentification with a group (Sellars 1980: 101). The question of\nwhether or not group identification needs to be in the individual\nparticipants\u2019 self-interest remains open. Whether or not a\nsituation of choice is looked at in terms of one\u2019s\n\u201cprivate\u201d or \u201cshared\u201d point of view depends on\nwhom one takes oneself to be: a solitary individual or a group member.\nSellars\u2019 aim is not to provide a theory of identity selection.\nHis claim is that the moral point of view requires us to\nabandon the egocentric perspective, and to conceive of ourselves as\n\u201cone of us\u201d. The \u201cwe\u201d at play here has to be\nunderstood in the least parochial sense. Only such we-intentionality\nactually serves the purpose for which Sellars devised the term\n\u201cwe-intention\u201d; only the we-intentions that are\nuniversally shared, and no parochial group attitudes, constitute the\nmoral point of view.\n",
