    "main_text": "Thoughts and States of Affairs || States of Affairs and Probabilities\n2.2 States of Affairs and Probabilities\n\nReinach (1911: 339) claimed that \u201cstates of affairs, and only\nstates of affairs, can adopt such modalities\u201d as probability and\npossibility. He had in mind that an object such as a die cannot be\npossible or probable. This seems plausible enough. It is equally\nplausible that facts are not probable or possible. However, why\ncan\u2019t thoughts be probable or possible?\n\nForbes (1989: 130\u2013131) refines Reinach\u2019s idea in taking\nstates of affairs as the fundamental bearers of modal\nproperties like being possible, necessary etc. From\nReinach we learn that particulars can\u2019t be the bearers of\nmodality. Fregean truth-values are also unsuited. According to\nFrege\u2019s semantics for assertoric sentences, every true (false)\nsentence, whether necessary or contingently true (false), refers to\nthe True (the False). Forbes appeals to our modal intuitions to argue\nfor a better candidate for the modal value bearer role,\n\n\na category of entity not so finely discriminated as thoughts but more\nfinely discriminated than truth-values, such that sentences with the\nsame entity in the category as their references are guaranteed to have\nthe same modal status. (1989: 130)\n\n\nLet us consider a pair of sentences to illustrate Forbes\u2019s\nargument for an entity less discriminating than thoughts and more\ndiscriminating than truth-values. Consider the sentence pairs:\n\n(1)\n\n\na.\nHesperus shines.\nb.\nPhosphorus shines.\n \n(2)\n\n\na.\nHesperus is Hesperus.\nb.\nHesperus is Phosphorus.\n \n\n\n(1a) to (2b) are all true. Hence, in Fregean terms, they all refer to\nthe True. Each of these sentences expresses a thought different from\nall others. However, the members of each pair have the same modal\nstatus that differs from the modal status of the members of the other\npair. (1a) and (1b) are contingently true; (2a) and (2b) necessarily\ntrue. If one lets sentences stand for or describe states of affairs\nwhose constituents are the referents of the semantically relevant\nsentence parts, one can capture this similarity: (1a) and (1b) ((2a)\nand (2b)) have the same modal status because these sentences stand for\nthe same state of affairs (Forbes 1989: 131). In general, sentences\nthat stand for the same state of affairs have the same modal value. It\nis then a short step to take states of affairs to be the primary or\nfundamental bearers of modal status (1989: 131\u20132). A sentence is\ncontingently (necessarily) true if, and only if, it stands for a state\nof affairs that contingently (necessarily)\n obtains.[2]\n\nCan\u2019t facts be the basic bearers of modal status? Take a further\nsentence pair:\n\n(3)\n\n\na.\nHesperus has an orbital period of 226 days.\nb.\nPhosphorus has an orbital period of 226 days.\n \n\n\n(3a) and (3b) are false, they express different thoughts, yet have the\nsame modal status: they might have been true. This similarity cannot\nbe explained by taking them to refer to the same fact; we need states\nof affairs.\n\nWe can now answer our initial question: Yes, we need states\nof affairs as well as thoughts. States of affairs and thoughts have\ndistinct individuation and existence conditions. Therefore, states of\naffairs can be the fundamental bearers of modal\nproperties.\n\nWe can strengthen the conclusion by considering ways to dispute it.\nConsider all thoughts that represent the same particulars and\npredicate the same properties of them. Let us call these thoughts\nreferentially equivalent. Vendler proposed that a fact is\n\u201can abstract entity which indiscriminately contains a set of\nreferentially equivalent true propositions\u201d (Vendler\n1967: 711; my emphasis). If we drop the restriction to true\npropositions and simplify Vendler\u2019s idea, we can propose that a\nstate of affairs is a set of referentially equivalent thoughts,\nwhether they are true or not. The state of affairs\nHesperus\u2019s shining is the set of all thoughts that are\nabout Hesperus and predicate the property of shining to it.\n\nHowever, such an approach to states of affairs makes them\nexplanatorily uninteresting. If we want to explain why (1a) and (1b)\n((2a)\u2013(2b)/(3a)\u2013(3b)) have the same modal profile,\nappealing to states of affairs in Vendler\u2019s sense does not allow\nus to make progress. For instance, saying that (1a) and (1b) have the\nsame modal profile because they belong to the set of thoughts that are\nabout Hesperus and predicate the property of shining to it is at best\na partial explanation. For it raises such questions as \u201cWhat has\nbelonging to this set to do with possibility?\u201d and \u201cIn\nvirtue of which property has a set of thoughts modal\nproperties\u201d? In contrast, the assumption that there are states\nof affairs that are not just a particular kind of set and that have\nproperties like being possible or being probable can\nbe independently motivated and is explanatory progress.\n",
