    "main_text": "The principle of similitude || Being: man, society, cosmos\n3.1 Being: man, society, cosmos\n\nAl-Farabi\u2019s notion of ultimate felicity has tremendous impact on\nhis philosophy of society. In the light of humanity\u2019s particular\ntelos, a society can be \u201cexcellent\n(fadil)\u201d, in the sense introduced\n above,[15]\n if and only if its cooperation pursues society\u2019s natural\ntelos, i.e., if it seeks to equip its members with the\nnecessary means for the attainment of individual happiness. Therefore,\nthe primary goal of governing a society must consist in providing the\nmeans so that everyone can acquire theoretical\n knowledge,[16]\n learn about her natural duties, and put them into practice. In order\nto explain his notion of the excellent society, al-Farabi falls back\non two recurrent examples, natural organisms and the cosmos. At first\nglance, this comparison might appear inappropriate, linking voluntary\nbehavior in the case of human beings and society with the strictly\nnatural and causal processes characterizing the functioning of\norganisms and the cosmos as a whole. However, al-Farabi\u2019s aim is\nnot to deny the distinction between the voluntary and the\nnatural\u2014quite the contrary.\n\nWhile human beings, on his account, are in fact endowed with free will\nand, hence, can organize their own lives as well as their communities\nad\n libitum,[17]\n there is, as seen above, a natural norm for humanity distinguishing\nthe good life from the bad life and, in terms of eschatology, the\nattainment of happiness from failure to do so. In this sense,\nal-Farabi clearly subscribes to what nowadays would be called a\nnatural law ethics. And it is precisely at this level that his two\nexamples, organisms and the cosmos, come into play and lend his\nnotions of society and happiness a conspicuously Platonic flavor. In\nal-Farabi\u2019s view, organisms and the cosmos are the perfect\nmodels which human beings\u2014for themselves as well as for their\nsocial lives\u2014are well advised to emulate:\n\n\nBoth the city and the household have an analogy with the body of the\nhuman being. The body is composed of different parts \u2026, each\ndoing a certain action, so that from all their actions they come\ntogether in mutual assistance to perfect the purpose of the human\nbeing\u2019s body. In the same way, both the city and the household\nare composed of different parts of a definite number \u2026, each\nperforming on its own a certain action, so that from their actions\nthey come together in mutual assistance to perfect the purpose of the\ncity or the household. (Selected Aphorisms 25: 23)\n\n\nEssentially, al-Farabi applies Aristotle\u2019s notion of\nergon to the cosmos and each of its members. Accordingly, the\ncosmos as such is not only determined by a certain order, it actually\nrepresents the best of all possible structures, as it is the effect of\nthe over-perfect first\n cause.[18]\n Consequently, every part of the cosmos possesses a specific function\nwhich it must perform in order to keep the perpetuum mobile\ncosmos running smoothly, without interruptions and disturbances. While\neverything else executes its function by nature, human beings,\nequipped with reason and free will, must choose to do so. Therefore,\nthey must understand the cosmic order and their own place and duty, or\nrather ergon, in the frame of this all-embracing structure,\nwhich, once again, underscores the significance attached to knowledge\nin al-Farabi\u2019s thought.\n\nAnd yet, the implications of the two paradigmatic examples, organisms\nand the cosmos, reach further, inasmuch as both examples represent\ncomplex entities with a diversified internal makeup. Granted, every\nelement of the cosmos or an organism in general contributes to the\nwell-being of the whole, nonetheless, each one has its peculiar\nactivity. The heart, for instance, is in charge of pumping the blood\nthrough the blood vessels and thus keeping the body alive, whereas the\nkidneys are responsible for filtering the blood and regulating water\nfluid levels. Similarly, al-Farabi gives to understand that each human\nbeing has a particular task within the framework of society, in view\nof her specific skills (cf. above,\n section 2.2,\n regarding the citizens\u2019 specific knowledge and activities\n [b.i and b.ii]):\n\n\nThe excellent city resembles the perfect and healthy body, all of\nwhose limbs co-operate \u2026. Now the limbs and organs of the body\nare different and their natural endowments and faculties are unequal\nin excellence, there being among them one ruling organ, namely the\nheart, and organs which are close in rank to that ruling organ\n\u2026. The same holds good in the case of the city. Its parts are\ndifferent by nature, and their natural dispositions are unequal in\nexcellence: there is in it a man who is the ruler, and there are\nothers whose ranks are close to the ruler, each of them with a\ndisposition and a habit through which he performs an action \u2026.\n(Perfect State V, 15, 4: 231\u20133)\n\n\nThis analogy constitutes the core of al-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of\nsociety, creating, however, several remarkable tensions within his\nthought. Thus, as seen above, in the vein of Aristotle, he maintains\nthat humanity\u2019s specific difference is rationality and that the\nnatural telos of every human being consists in perfecting\nthis feature. Meanwhile, he also holds that human beings differ with\nregard to their natural endowments. Accordingly, some are highly\nintelligent, while others are not. Some have the potential to become\nphilosophers and recognize the makeup of the world, happiness, and the\nnatural norm encapsulated in these ontological givens;\nothers\u2014actually the majority, as al-Farabi believes\u2014do not\npossess these capacities. This raises the two interrelated questions\nof, first, how these individuals can nevertheless attain felicity, if\nat all; and, second, how society must be set up in order to achieve\nits own natural telos and offer each member an equal\nopportunity for attaining individual happiness.\n",
