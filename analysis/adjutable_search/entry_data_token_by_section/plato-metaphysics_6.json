    "main_text": "The Deficiency of Particulars\n7. The Deficiency of Particulars\n\n\nMetaphors dominate Plato's remarks about the relation of particulars\nto Forms. Of special importance are the metaphors of image and\noriginal, copy and model, example and paradigm. The physical world and\nall of its constituents are, according to Plato, a copy or image of the\nForms, and since all copies are dependent on the original, the physical\nworld is dependent on Forms. In so far as Platonic Forms are not\ndependent on particulars, i.e., they are not immanent universals, the\ndependence is only \u2018one way\u2019. A second important metaphor\nfrom the Phaedo also suggests that particulars are dependent\non Forms whereas Forms are not dependent on them. Particulars\nstrive to be such as the Forms are and thus in comparison to\nForms are imperfect or deficient. Forms, then, are independent, whereas\nparticulars are dependent on Forms and thus deficient with respect to\nthem.\n\n\nThe Phaedo (especially the Affinity Argument, 78b-84b) also\npoints up a host of features, usually found in pairs, which\ndifferentiate particulars from Forms. Forms are immaterial, non-spatial\nand atemporal. Particulars are material and extended in space and in\ntime. Forms do not change and may not even be subject to\nCambridge-change, i.e. relational changes involving, for instance, a\nsoul cognizing them at various moments. Particulars change, may even be\nsubject to change in any respect, and may even be subject to\nchange in every respect at any given moment, i.e., total\nHeraclitean flux. Particulars are complex or multi-form\n(polyeidetic) composites (suntheton), whereas Forms\nare pure, simple or uniform (monoeidetic, hen). Particulars\nare the objects of the senses and of belief. Forms are the objects of\nknowledge, grasped by the intellect through definitions, dialectic, or\notherwise. Particulars appear, and perhaps are, both F and\nnot-F for some property F: particulars suffer from\nthe compresence of opposites. The Form of F cannot be\nconceived to be not-F (and perhaps is never not-F).\nHence the Form, The F Itself, does not suffer compresence (at\nleast with respect to being F).\n\n\nAristotle's account of Plato's reasons for introducing Forms\nindicates that change and essence are critical to Plato's thinking\nabout the deficiency of material particulars. \u201c\u2026Socrates\nsought the universal in them and turned to definitions. Plato,\naccepting this, thought that this (defining) comes to be about\ndifferent things, and not about sensibles. For it is impossible that\nthe common definition be about any of the sensibles, for these are\nalways changing.\u201d (Metaphysics 987b1\u20137) At the very\nbeginning, then, the search for knowledge leads to definitions. The\nquestion is where one can find definitions or definables. Aristotle\nasserts that Plato thought that definitions could not be found in the\nsensibles because they were always changing.\n\n\nFollowing Aristotle's lead, a most economical way to account for the\ncognitive superiority of Forms and the inferiority of sensibles would\nbe to allot essences only to the Forms. Since we know from the early\nand the middle dialogues that knowledge is of essence, it is tempting\nto think that the absence of essence is responsible for the deficiency\nof the particulars. Particulars are deficient because they can or do\nchange. They change because their properties are contingent. Their\nproperties are contingent because they lack any essences (or any\nessential properties). But this is too quick. First, Plato's\nparticulars may not change with respect to all of their properties.\nPerhaps some have essential properties along with a host of contingent\nproperties. Then Aristotle might be taken to imply that only with\nrespect to a certain number of contingent properties did Plato posit\ndefinable Forms. Moreover, Aristotle seems to allude only to an\nepistemological difficulty arising from changing particulars. It is\npossible that this difficulty arises independently of whether some\nparticulars have essential properties. For instance, particulars might\nbe epistemologically problematic because they have many properties,\nonly some of which are changing.\n\n\nCertain passages (e.g., Phaedo 74ff., 78ff.,\nRepublic 476e-479, 523aff) suggest that particulars are\ncognitively deficient because they are complex. Suppose that a\nparticular is F. Complexity entails that a particular has at\nleast two properties, F and G. Since the G\nis not-F, every complex particular can be said to be\nF and not-F. Our inability to grasp the property\n(F) in the particular is then grounded not in the compresence\nof an opposite property, but in the compresence of another\nproperty. The inquiring mind is unable to isolate the desired\nproperty from any other. This suggests that a fundamental contrast\nbetween the particulars and the Form F is that the latter is\nsimple, or monoeidetic, in that it possesses just itself\u2014It is just\n F.[11]\n\n\nAt other times, the cognitive reliability of the Forms seems grounded\nin the analyticity, or logical certainty, or necessity, that holds\nbetween the essence of a Form and various properties\n\u2018discernible in its nature.\u2019 Looked at in this light, the\nfactor responsible for the deficiency of sensibles is that their\nproperties are contingently related to them, in contrast to the Forms\nwhose properties are necessarily stuck to them with \u2018logical\nglue\u2019 (see Vlastos 1969; Code 1993).\n\n\nIf we emphasize the contingency of all of its properties, a\nparticular cannot have any essential properties. On the other hand, if\nwe emphasize the complexity of the particular, then we are free to\nascribe essences to (some) particulars. Hence, there could be knowledge\nof these particulars, i.e., knowledge that Socrates is a man.\nConversely, if complexity is the cause of cognitive deficiency, then\nwith respect to Forms, the fact that all their properties are necessary\nproperties would not suffice to render Forms knowable. For if\na Form has many properties, then in the broad sense the Form F\nItself, since it is F and G, will be F and\nnot-F. Thus Forms, too, might not be knowable.\n\n\nThere is reason to doubt that the compresence of opposites or the mere\ncomplexity of particulars is responsible for their deficiency (but see\nFine 1993, esp. Ch. 4).  According to Aristotle, change is critical,\nespecially in so far as it precludes definability and thus\nknowledge. Given that knowledge requires essence, and essence excludes\nchange (in the case of the essential properties), Aristotle would have\nus deny that essence is predicable of particulars for the Plato of the\nmiddle period. Particulars will be epistemologically deficient in that\nthere can be no knowledge of them, unless we abandon the thesis that\nknowledge is of essence. And particulars will be metaphysically\ndeficient, at least to the extent that possessing an essence is a\nbetter state than lacking one. But more can be said about the peculiar\ncontingent manner in which particulars have their properties and why\nit is that one cannot look to the particular beauties to obtain\nknowledge of, e.g., Beauty.\n\n\nFrom the outset of the Phaedo, particulars are branded as\nmaterial and, as a result, spoken of in the pejorative. Indeed, matter\nseems to be at the root of the other features that characterize\nparticulars. What is extended in space (and through, or in, time) is\nbody. The composite is also linked with the material. Because a\nmaterial particular is composite, it is also multi-form or complex\n(Phaedo 80b4). Complex material particulars are subject to\nchange in so far as their composite nature invites dissolution or\nconstruction, or more generally coming-to-be or\n perishing.[12]\n When\ntaken broadly, as it is at Phaedo 100ff (or in the analogies\nof the middle books of the Republic), generation and\ndestruction includes the exchange of properties. And since compresence\nrequires complexity, the material nature of particulars is one of the\nroots of each material, sensible particular being both F and\nnot-F.\n\n\nThe spatio-temporal, material character of particulars also\ncontributes directly to the explanation of their suffering, and seeming\nto suffer, the compresence of opposites. In the middle period, Plato\nseems to accept an account of perception that has as a necessary\ncomponent the interaction of material elements. There may be\nsubsequent or simultaneous psychic\n activity,[13]\n the judgment part of\n\u2018perceptual judgment\u2019, but there is at least some material\nintercourse between the body of the perceived object and the sense\nfaculty whose sensory object it is. The qualifications needed to\naccount for a particular's being F and not-F are\ntemporal, or a function of being comparable to other extended material\nobjects, or standing in different relations to\n perceivers.[14]\n Since\nmaterial extension is a necessary condition for their perceptibility,\nno particular could appear to have compresent properties\nunless it were material.\n\n\nIn virtue of their material nature, particulars are extended,\nmutable, and subject to generation and destruction. How then is the\nmateriality of the particular related to the characterization for which\nparticipation is responsible? What materiality induces is that a\nproperty be manifested in a specific way. So, when we consider\na particular stick to ask what is its length, we expect to be told a\nspecific quantity: the stick is five inches long. The same is true of\nits weight: it is six ounces. If we are concerned to explain why the\nstick is that long, one answer is that the matter of the particular\ncompels it to have determinate\n length.[15]\n Only when we shift to\nthe question \u2018What is length?\u2019, do we begin to reflect upon\nthe relations between length and the fact that each of these material\nparticulars has a specific length. In the Meno (74ff), Plato\ndevelops the notion of determinable and determinate. There the\nproperties themselves are determinates falling under a determinable,\ne.g., crimson and scarlet under red, red under color. Now, the\nproperties under consideration are all generic or\ndeterminable, but when present in the particular they take on a\nspecific, determinate character. Consider, for instance, mathematical\nfigures. The Triangle itself will be a three-sided figure whose lines\nlack breadth and whose angles have no determinate degree. But all\nparticular triangles will have lines with some breadth and angles with\ncertain\n degrees.[16]\n There is, then, a gap between the\nnon-specific and non-determinate property and the way it is manifested\nin the particular. The immaterial Form of Triangle is abstract and can\nhave no particular dimension. The property in the particular,\non the other hand, must be specific and determinate\u2014the property in\nthe particular is always a specific, determinate length, or color\n(hue), or size, or so on\u2014because the particular is concrete, and\nbecause the property in the particular is itself a particular instance\nof the non-determinate property.\n\n\nThe determinacy of the material particular is set against the\nnon-determinacy of the Form. This determinacy of property is only one\naspect of the difference. A second is the contingent way in which the\nparticular has this determinate property. The material aspect is, in\nthe case of particulars, partly responsible for the contingency of its\nproperty possession. Matter is a sufficient condition for contingency\nbut not necessary, since souls are in many respects contingently what\nthey are, e.g., desirous of money. (Matter is also a sufficient\ncondition for complexity, though again not necessary, if souls, or\nForms, can be complex.)\n",
