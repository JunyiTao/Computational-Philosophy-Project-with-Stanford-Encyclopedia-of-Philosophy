Criticizing Naturalism (427d\u2013435d)\n\nOnce Socrates has concluded his discussion of individual\netymologically simple names, Hermogenes wants to know whether Cratylus\naccepts Socrates\u2019 account of the natural correctness of names.\nCratylus endorses this account wholeheartedly (427d\u2013428c).\nFearing that he might have fallen prey to some sort of self-deception,\nSocrates suggests revisiting his account together with Cratylus\n(428d). Cratylus agrees and takes over from Hermogenes as\nSocrates\u2019 interlocutor. It soon turns out that he is committed\nnot only to\n (NAT**),\n but to some very counterintuitive additional claims. He thus espouses\na radical version of the naturalist theory of correctness that\nSocrates has presented (428e\u2013430a). Socrates marshals a series\nof arguments against Cratylus\u2019 position\n(430a\u2013435b)\u2014and is led to a disappointingly vague\nconclusion about the correctness of names (435b\u2013d). This section\ntakes a closer look at this pivotal and difficult passage.\n",
