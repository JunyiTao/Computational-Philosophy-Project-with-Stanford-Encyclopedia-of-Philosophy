    "main_text": "Deflationary Nominalism || Central features of deflationary nominalism\n5.2 Assessment: benefits of deflationary nominalism and a problem\nOf the nominalist views discussed in this essay, deflationary\nnominalism is the view that comes closest to solving (or, in some\ncases, dissolving) the five problems that have been used to assess\nnominalist proposals. With the possible exceptions of the issue of\ntaking mathematical language literally and the ontological problem,\nall of the remaining problems are explicitly and successfully\naddressed. I will discuss each of them in turn.\n5.2.1 The epistemological problem dissolved\nHow can the deflationary nominalist explain the possibility of\nmathematical knowledge, given the abstract nature of mathematical\nobjects? On this version of nominalism, this problem\nvanishes. Mathematical knowledge is ultimately obtained from what\nfollows from mathematical principles. Given that mathematical objects\ndo not exist, they play no role in how mathematical results are known\n(Azzouni 1994). What is required is that the relevant mathematical\nresult be established via a proof. Proofs are the source of\nmathematical knowledge.\nIt might be argued that certain mathematical statements are known\nwithout the corresponding proof. Consider the G\u00f6del sentence\ninvoked in the proof of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem: the\nsentence is true, but it cannot be proved in the system under\nconsideration (if the latter is consistent). Do we have knowledge of\nthe G\u00f6del sentence? Clearly we do, despite the fact that the\nsentence is not derivable in the system in question. As a result, the\nknowledge involved here is of a different sort than the one\narticulated in terms of what can be proved in a given system.\nIn my view, the deflationary nominalist has no problem making sense\nof our knowledge of the G\u00f6del sentence. It is an intuitive sort\nof knowledge, which emerges from what the sentence in question\nstates. All that is required in order to know that the sentence is\ntrue is to properly understand it. But that's not how mathematical\nresults are typically established: they need to be proved.\nAccording to Azzouni, we know the G\u00f6del sentence as long as we\nare able to embed the syntactically incomplete system (such as Peano\narithmetic) in a stronger system in which the truth predicate for the\noriginal system occurs and in which the G\u00f6del sentence is proved\n(Azzouni 1994, pp. 134\u2013135; Azzouni 2006, p. 89, note 38, last\nparagraph, and pp. 161\u2013162).\nClearly, the account does not turn mathematical knowledge into\nsomething easy to obtain, given that, normally, it is no\nstraightforward matter to determine whether some result follows from a\ngiven group of axioms. Part of the difficulty emerges from the fact\nthat the logical consequences of a non-trivial group of axioms are\noften not transparent: significant work is required to establish such\nconsequences. This is as it should be, given the non-trivial nature of\nmathematical knowledge.\n5.2.2 Dissolving the problem of the application of mathematics\nThe deflationary nominalist offers various considerations to the\neffect that there is no genuine philosophical problem in the success\nof applied mathematics (Azzouni 2000). Once particular attention is\ngiven to implicational opacity\u2014our inability to see, before a\nproof is offered, the consequences of various mathematical\nstatements\u2014much of the alleged surprise in the successful\napplication of mathematics should vanish. Ultimately, the so-called\nproblem of the application of mathematics\u2014of understanding how\nit is possible that mathematics can be successfully applied to the\nphysical world should\u2014is an artificially designed issue rather\nthan a genuine problem.\nColyvan defends the opposing view (Colyvan 2001b), insisting that\nthe application of mathematics to science does present a genuine\nproblem. In particular, he argues that two major philosophical\naccounts of mathematics, Field's mathematical fictionalism and Quine's\nplatonist realism, are unable to explain the problem. Thus, he\nconcludes that the problem cuts across the realism/anti-realism debate\nin the philosophy of mathematics. The deflationary nominalist would\ninsist that what is ultimately at issue\u2014implicational\nopacity\u2014is not a special problem, even though to the extent that\nit is a problem, it is one that is equally faced by realists and\nanti-realists about mathematics.\nThis does not mean that the application of mathematics is a\nstraightforward matter. Clearly, it is not. But the difficulties\ninvolved in the successful application of mathematics do not raise a\nspecial philosophical problem, particularly as soon as the issue of\nimplicational opacity is acknowledged\u2014an issue that is common to\nboth pure and applied mathematics.\nThe issue of understanding the way in which mathematics in fact\ngets applied is something that the deflationary nominalist explicitly\naddresses, carefully examining the central features and the\nlimitations of different models of the application of mathematics\n(see, in particular, the second part of (Azzouni 2004)).\n5.2.3 Uniform semantics\nThe deflationary nominalist, as noted above, is not committed to\noffering a reconstruction, or any kind of reformulation, of\nmathematical theories. (The exception here is the case of inconsistent\nmathematical or scientific theories, which according to the\ndeflationary nominalist, ideally are regimented as consistent\nfirst-order theories.) No special semantics is required to make sense\nof mathematics: the same semantics that is used in the case of\nscientific theories is invoked for mathematical theories. It may seem\nthat the uniform semantics requirement is thus satisfied. But the\nsituation is more complicated.\nIt may be argued that the deflationary nominalist needs to provide\nthe semantics for the existential and universal claims in mathematics,\nscience and ordinary language. After all, it does sound puzzling to\nstate: \u201cIt is true that there are numbers, but numbers do not\nexist\u201d. What is such semantics? The deflationary nominalist will\nrespond by noting that this semantics is precisely the standard\nsemantics of classical logic, with the familiar conditions for the\nexistential and universal quantifiers, but without the assumption that\nsuch quantifiers are ontologically committing. The fact that no\nontological import is assigned to the quantifiers does not change\ntheir semantics. After all, the metalanguage in which the semantics is\ndeveloped already has universal and existential quantifiers, and these\nquantifiers need not be interpreted as providing ontological\ncommitment any more than the object language quantifiers do. As a\nresult, the same semantics is used throughout.\nIt may be argued that the deflationary nominalist needs to\nintroduce the distinction between ontologically serious (or\nontologically committing) uses of the quantifiers and ontologically\ninnocent (or ontologically non-committing) uses. If so, this would\npresumably require a different semantics for these quantifiers. In\nresponse, the deflationary nominalist will deny the need for such\ndistinction. In order to mark ontological commitment, an existence\npredicate, which expresses ontological independence, is used. Those\nthings that are ontologically independent of us (that is, of our\nlinguistic practices and psychological processes) are those to which\nwe are ontologically committed. The mark of ontological commitment is\nnot made at the level of the quantifiers, but via the existence\npredicate.\nThis means, however, that even though the semantics is uniform\nthroughout the sciences, mathematics and ordinary language,\ndeflationary nominalism requires the introduction of the existence\npredicate. But, at least on the surface, this predicate does not seem\nto have a counterpart in the way language is used in these domains. It\nis the same semantics throughout, but the formalization of the\ndiscourse requires an extended language to accommodate the existence\npredicate. As a result, the uniformity of the semantics comes with the\ncost of the introduction of a special predicate into the language to\nmark ontological commitment for formalization.\nPerhaps the deflationary nominalist will respond by arguing that\nthe existence predicate is already part of the language, maybe\nimplicitly via contextual and rhetorical factors (Azzouni 2007,\nSection III; Azzouni 2004, Chapter 5). What would be needed then is\nevidence for such a claim, and an indication of how exactly the\npredicate is in fact found in scientific, mathematical and ordinary\ncontexts. Consider, for instance, the sentences:\n\n(S) There is no set of all sets.\n(P) Perfectly frictionless planes do not exist.\n(M) Mice exist; talking mice don't.\n\nPresumably, in all of these cases the existence predicate is\nused. As a result, the sentences could be formalized as follows:\n\n(S) \u2200x(Sx \u2192\n  \u00acEx), where \u2018S\u2019 is (for\n  simplicity) the predicate \u2018set of all sets\u2019, and\n  \u2018E\u2019 is the existence predicate.\n(P) \u2200x(Px \u2192\n  \u00acEx), where \u2018P\u2019 is (for\n  simplicity) the predicate \u2018perfectly frictionless\n  plane\u2019, and \u2018E\u2019 is the existence\n  predicate.\n(M) \u2203x(Mx \u2227 Ex)\n  \u2227 \u2200x((Mx \u2227 Tx)\n  \u2192 \u00acEx), where \u2018M\u2019 is the\n  predicate \u2018mice\u2019, \u2018T\u2019 is the\n  predicate \u2018to talk\u2019, and \u2018E\u2019 is the\n  existence predicate.\n\nIn all of these cases, the formalization requires some change in\nthe logical form of the natural language sentences in order to\nintroduce the existence predicate. And that is arguably a cost for the\nview. After all, in these cases, mathematical, scientific and ordinary\nlanguages do not seem to be taken literally\u2014a topic to which I\nturn now.\n5.2.4 Taking mathematical language literally\nWe saw that with the introduction of the existence predicate it is\nnot clear that the deflationary nominalist is in fact able to take\nmathematical language literally. After all, some reconstruction of\nthat language seems to be needed. It should be granted that the level\nof reconstruction involved is significantly less than what is found in\nthe other versions of nominalism discussed above. As opposed to them,\nthe deflationary nominalist is able to accommodate significant aspects\nof mathematical practice without the need for creating a full parallel\ndiscourse (in particular, no operators, modal or fictional, need to be\nintroduced). However, some level of reconstruction is still needed to\naccommodate the existence predicate, which then compromises the\ndeflationary nominalist's capacity to take mathematical language\nliterally.\nA related concern is that the deflationary nominalist introduces a\nnon-standard notion of reference that does not presuppose the\nexistence of the objects that are referred to (Bueno and Zalta\n2005). This move goes hand in hand with the understanding of the\nquantifiers as not being ontologically committing, and it does seem to\nlimit the deflationary nominalist's capacity to take mathematical\nlanguage literally. After all, a special use of \u2018refers\u2019\nis needed to accommodate the claim that \u201c\u2018a\u2019\nrefers to b, but b does not exist\u201d. The\ndeflationary nominalist, however, resists this charge (Azzouni 2009a,\n2010a, 2010b).\n5.2.5 The ontological problem\nThe ontological problem is also dissolved by the deflationary\nnominalism. Clearly, deflationary nominalism has no commitment either\nto mathematical objects or to a modal ontology of any kind (including\npossible worlds, abstract entities as proxy for possible worlds, or\nother forms of replacement for the expression of modal claims). The\ndeflationary nominalists not only avoid the commitment to mathematical\nobjects, they also claim that such objects have no properties\nwhatsoever. This means that the deflationary nominalist's ontology is\nextremely minimal: only concrete objects are ultimately\nassumed\u2014objects that are ontologically independent of our\npsychological processes and linguistic practices. In particular, no\ndomain of nonexistent objects is posited nor a realm of genuine\nproperties of such objects. By \u2018genuine properties\u2019 I mean\nthose properties that hold only in virtue of what the objects in\nquestion are, and not as the result of some external relations to\nother objects. For example, although Sherlock Holmes does not exist,\nhe has the property of being thought of by me as I write this\nsentence. This is not, however, a genuine property of Sherlock Holmes\nin the intended sense.\nDeflationary nominalism is not a form of Meinongianism (Azzouni\n2010a). Although the ontology of deflationary nominalism is not\nsignificantly different from that of the Meinongian, the ideology of\nthe two views\u2014at least assuming a particular, traditional\ninterpretation of Meinongianism\u2014is importantly different. The\ndeflationary nominalist is not committed to any subsisting objects, in\ncontrast to what is often claimed to be a distinctive feature of\nMeinongianism.\nIt is not clear to me, however, that this traditional reading of\nMeinongianism is correct. If we consider the subsisting objects as\nthose that are abstract, and if we take only concrete objects as\nexisting, the resulting picture ideologically is not significantly\ndifferent from the one favored by the deflationary nominalist. Still,\nthe deflationary nominalists distance themselves from Meinongianism\n(Azzouni 2010a).\nWith the meager ontological commitments, the deflationary\nnominalist fares very well on the ontological front. One source of\nconcern is how meager the deflationary nominalist's ontology\nultimately is. For instance, platonists would insist that mathematical\nobjects are ontologically independent of our psychological processes\nand linguistic practices, and\u2014using the criterion of ontological\ncommitment offered by the deflationary nominalist\u2014they would\ninsist that these objects do exist. Similarly, modal realists\n(such as Lewis 1986) would also argue that possible worlds are\nontologically independent of us in the relevant sense, thus concluding\nthat these objects also exist. Deflationary nominalists will try to\nresist these conclusions. But unless their arguments are successful at\nthis point, the concern remains that the deflationary nominalist may\nhave a significantly more robust ontology\u2014given the proposed\ncriterion of ontological commitment\u2014than advertised.\nIt may be argued that deflationary nominalists are changing the\nrules of the debate. They state that mathematicians derive statements\nof the form \u201cThere are Fs\u201d, but insist that the\nobjects in question do not exist, given that quantifier commitment and\nontological commitment should be distinguished. This strategy is\nfundamentally different from those found in the nominalist proposals\ndiscussed before. It amounts to the denial of the first premise of the\nindispensability argument (\u201cWe ought to be ontologically\ncommitted to all and only those entities that are indispensable to our\nbest theories of the world\u201d). Even though quantification over\nmathematical entities is indispensable to our best theories of the\nworld (thus, the deflationary nominalist accepts the second premise of\nthe argument), this fact does not entail that these entities\nexist. After all, we can quantify over objects that do not exist,\ngiven the rejection of the indispensability argument's first\npremise.\nBut are deflationary nominalists really changing the rules of the\ndebate? If Quine's criterion of ontological commitment provides such\nrules, then they are. But why should we grant that Quine's criterion\nplay such a role? Deflationary nominalists challenge this deeply held\nassumption in ontological debates. And by doing so, they pave the way\nfor the development of a distinctive form of nominalism in the\nphilosophy of mathematics.\n",
