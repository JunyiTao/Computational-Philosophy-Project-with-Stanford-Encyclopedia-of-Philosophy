Psychic Faculties\n\n\nAlthough willing to provide a common account of the soul in these\ngeneral terms, Aristotle devotes most of his energy in De\nAnima to detailed investigations of the soul\u2019s individual\ncapacities or faculties, which he first lists as nutrition,\nperception, and mind, with perception receiving the lion\u2019s share of\nattention. He later also introduces desire, evidently as a discrete\nfaculty on par with those initially introduced. The broadest is\nnutrition, which is shared by all natural living organisms; animals\nhave perception in addition; and among natural organisms humans alone\nhave mind. Aristotle maintains that various kinds of souls, nutritive,\nperceptual, and intellectual, form a kind of hierarchy. Any creature\nwith reason will also have perception; any creature with perception\nwill also have the ability to take on nutrition and to reproduce; but\nthe converse does not hold. Thus, plants show up with only the\nnutritive soul, animals have both perceptual and nutritive faculties,\nand humans have all three. The reasons why this should be so are\nbroadly teleological. In brief, every living creature as such grows,\nreaches maturity, and declines. Without a nutritive capacity, these\nactivities would be impossible (De Anima iii 12,\n434a22\u2013434b18; cf. De Partibus Animalium iv 10, 687a24\u2013690a10;\nMetaphysics xii 10, 1075a16\u201325). So, Aristotle concludes,\npsychology must investigate not only perceiving and thinking, but also\nnutrition.\n\n\nThere is some dispute about which of the psychic abilities mentioned\nby Aristotle in De Anima qualify as full-fledged or autonomous\nfaculties. He evidently accepts the three already mentioned as\ncentrally important. Indeed, he is willing to demarcate a hierarchy of\nlife in terms of them. Even so, he also discusses two other capacities,\nimagination (De Anima iii 3) and desire (De Anima iii\n9 and 10), and appeals to them in both his account of thinking and his\nphilosophy of action. He does little, however, to characterize either\nin any intrinsic way. He evidently regards imagination as a sort of\nsubordinate faculty, integrated in various ways with the faculties of\nnutrition, perception, and thought. Desire is still more complex.\nDespite its not occurring without the sensory faculty (De Anima\niii 7 412a12\u201314), desire seems in the end elevated to a full capacity,\nprimarily because of its role in the explanation of purposive behavior.\nHis discussions of imagination and desire raise interesting questions\nabout how Aristotle views the various capacities of soul as integrating\ninto unified forms. They also raise questions along with his\ndiscussions of the other faculties as to how Aristotle conceives the\nunity of the whole soul. Some scholars seem content to characterize an\nAristotelian soul as a set or sum of capacities, whereas Aristotle\nhimself evidently demands a non-aggregative form of unity (De\nAnima ii 3 414b28\u201332, cf. iii 9 432a\u2013b6).\n",
