    "main_text": "\n\nThe philosophy of digital art is the philosophical study of art that\ncrucially relies on computer processing in its production or\npresentation. There are many kinds of digital art, including digital\ncinema and video, digital photography and painting, electronic music,\nliterary works generated by so-called \u201cchatbots\u201d, NFT art,\nnet art, and video games. For the full range of digital art kinds, the\naim is to identify their essential features, ground their proper\nappreciation, and situate our understanding of them in relation to\npre-existing debates in aesthetics. This first-order inquiry cannot\nproceed without acknowledgment of the enormous interdisciplinary and\npopular interest in digital media. Claims are frequently made about\nfundamental shifts in the way we classify, evaluate, and engage with\nart now that computers seem to be involved in every kind of cultural\nproduction. The so-called \u201cdigital condition\u201d (Kittler\n1999) is characterized by a loss of trust in the image, a new way of\nexperiencing the world as indeterminate and fragmentary, and a\nbreakdown of traditional boundaries between artist and audience,\nartwork and artistic process. If we are looking for evidence of the\ndigital condition, we need to understand its conceptual structure.\nHere\u2019s where the philosopher comes in.\n\nAlthough technology-based art is viewed as the \u201cfinal\navant-garde of the twentieth-century\u201d (Rush 2005), and digital\nart has been part of the mainstream art world since the late 1990s\n(Paul 2008), the philosophy of digital art is still an emerging\nsubfield. Three seminal monographs, one on videogames (Tavinor 2009),\none on digital cinema (Gaut 2010), and one on computer art (Lopes\n2010), have been invaluable in laying the groundwork concerning\nphilosophical questions about art and computer technology. Since these\npublications, further philosophical attention has been given to the\ndigital arts, including the first published volume to focus on the\naesthetics of videogames (see Robson & Tavinor, eds., 2018). It\ncan be challenging for philosophers to keep up with the rapid rate at\nwhich digital technology develops. But a number of recent articles on\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in the arts show that philosophers are\nwell aware of and ready to meet this challenge (Atencia-Linares and\nArtiga 2022; Milli\u00e8re 2022; Moruzzi 2022; Roberts and Krueger\n2022). The body of philosophical work on AI art will no doubt continue\nto grow, as will bodies of work on virtual reality in art and Internet\nart. With this growth, we can expect to to learn a great deal more\nabout the extent and character of the digital cultural revolution.\n",
