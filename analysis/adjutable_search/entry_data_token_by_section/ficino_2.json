    "main_text": "Work || The Platonic Theology\n2.1 The Platonic Theology\n\n\nThis process of intense reading and commenting set the stage for\nFicino to write one of his most interesting works. Between 1469 and\n1474 he composed his Theologia platonica (Platonic\nTheology), which awaited print publication until 1482. The work\u2019s\nsubtitle, On the Immortality of Souls, is indicative of\nFicino\u2019s goals. He feared that his contemporaries were losing their\nway, and he believed that the right sort of approach would help them\nfind it. Above all, there was a tendency, he wrote (in the work\u2019s\ndedicatory preface, addressed to Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici), to separate\nphilosophy from religion. Using Plato, and trying \u201cto paint a\nportrait of Plato as close as possible to the Christian truth,\u201d\n(Allen and Hankins 2001\u201306, vol.1, proem, sec.3,\npp. 10\u201311) seemed to Ficino the way out of this impasse.\n\n\nHow to paint this portrait as fully as possible was the key\nquestion. Ficino considered the Platonic corpus a treasury of wisdom,\nfilled with different subject matters but always, when rightly\ninterpreted, leading one to the divine. In the same preface, he writes\nof Plato that \u201cwhatever subject he deals with, he quickly brings\nit round, in a spirit of utmost piety, to the contemplation and\nworship of God.\u201d Ficino conceived his own Platonic\nTheology as a similar sort of treasury, and as a Christian\ncorrective to a work he greatly admired, Proclus\u2019s own\nPlatonic Theology, a work that, precisely because of its\nthreefold status, seems emblematic: first, Proclus\u2019s work was for the\nmost part \u201cnew\u201d for the fifteenth-century West, one of the\nmany interesting texts uncovered by that century\u2019s tireless search for\nmatters ancient; second, Proclus was a decided anti-Christian; third\nand no less powerfully, Proclus\u2019s style of philosophizing, like much\npagan later Platonism largely unknown to Ficino\u2019s medieval\npredecessors, shared deep family resemblances with Christianity. Among\nthese aspects one can include: the efficacy of theurgic rituals, which\nhad their Christian analogy in sacraments (see Celenza 2001); and a\n\u201cmonotheism\u201d that respected the necessity of having one\nsupreme being (for later Platonists, \u201cthe One,\u201d for\nChristians, \u201cGod\u201d) but that permitted its practitioners to\naccess the divine directly, for pagans, through worship of various\ngods; for Christians, through the cult of the saints (see Athanassiadi\nand Frede 1999, 1\u201320).\n\n\nYet Ficino needed to guard not only against the seductive danger of\nthese \u201cnew\u201d ancient texts, important though they were for\nthe simultaneous appeal and potential instability they generated.  He\nalso inherited from his humanist counterparts in the earlier part of\nthe fifteenth century (men like Leonardo Bruni, 1370\u20131444) the\nnotion that it was imperative to educate society\u2019s elites, the\ningeniosi, or acute wits, as Michael Allen translated the\nterm (see Allen 1998). His Platonic Theology, Ficino hoped,\nwould contain genres of argumentation and styles of language that,\ntogether, would represent a treasury of wisdom, perfectly apt for\ndifferent varieties of his contemporaries who might have wavered in\ntheir faith. For those inclined to the newly fashionable classicizing\nLatinity, Ficino includes in the Platonic Theology countless\nquotations from Latin classics; for those of an Aristotelian bent,\nFicino has natural philosophical arguments (for one example see Allen\nand Hankins (eds.) 2001\u201306, 5.4, vol. 2, pp. 20\u201323 and\ncf. Aristotle, Meteor., 1.3 and 1.9 for descriptions of\n\u201cantiperistasis\u201d to which Ficino seems there to be\nalluding); and for those who might be more inclined to an\nanti-rationalist religiosity, Ficino includes copious biblical\nallusions and quotations. Ficino even has an entire book of the\nPlatonic Theology devoted to refuting Avveroistic ideas, in\nwhich the lion\u2019s share of argumentation harks back in content, if\nnot always in form, to Thomas Aquinas and the scholastic\ntradition. The Platonic Theology was a work of\nsynthesis, but not of systematic philosophy, as thinkers from the\neighteenth century on would have understood that latter term.\nDifferent styles of argumentation, flights of rhetorical fancy,\nnumerous puns, intertextual allusions, un-sourced citations, and overt\nappeals to faith all compete for the reader\u2019s attention.\n",
