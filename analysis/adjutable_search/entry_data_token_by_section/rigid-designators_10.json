    "main_text": "Philosophical Work for Rigidity || Mind\n3.4 Mind\n\nKripke appeals to rigid designation in arguing against the\n identity theory of mind,\n which is really a constellation of theories. A broad division between\nidentity theories can be drawn between type identity theories and\ntoken identity theories: here is a standard Kripkean argument against\ntoken identity theories, which are often thought to be more compelling\nthan type identity theories. Kripke is typically understood to put\nforward something like this argument. \n\nThe Argument Against Token Identity: Suppose that every\nparticular mental event is identical to some particular brain event.\nThen we can take some pain and name it \u2018P\u2019, and\nwe can do the same for the corresponding brain event, calling it\n\u2018C\u2019 (for \u201cc-fiber firing,\u201d assuming\nfor the sake of argument that that is the corresponding brain event).\nAccording to the identity theory, P = C. But in\nreality, P \u2260 C. C could have existed\nwithout P: that very c-fiber firing could have obtained even\nwhile there was no corresponding P. Your c-fibers could have\nbeen blasting away even as you felt nothing at all. In the same way,\nP could have existed without C. You could have felt\nthat same dull, throbbing sensation in your forehead without the\ncorresponding c-fibers having ever acted up. Now, merely showing that\nC could have existed without P and that P\ncould have existed without C does not yet belie\n\u2018P = C\u2019. For this statement might be\ntrue necessarily or contingently. Since P and C\ncould each exist without the other, the statement cannot be\nnecessarily true. But there is still the possibility that the\nstatement is contingently true. There are contingently true\nstatements, as we have seen: e.g., \u2018Hesperus = the brightest\nnon-lunar object in the evening sky\u2019. However, it cannot be that\n\u2018P = C\u2019 is contingently true, as\n\u2018Hesperus = the brightest non-lunar object in the evening\nsky\u2019 is. \u2018Hesperus = the brightest non-lunar object in the\nevening sky\u2019 is contingently true because \u2018Hesperus\u2019\nis a rigid designator and \u2018the brightest non-lunar object in the\nevening sky\u2019 is non-rigid. Because \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018the brightest non-lunar object in the evening sky\u2019\ndesignate the same object at the actual world, \u2018Hesperus = the\nbrightest non-lunar object in the evening sky\u2019 is true; because\n\u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018the brightest non-lunar object in\nthe evening sky\u2019 designate different objects at some other\nworlds, \u2018Hesperus = the brightest non-lunar object in the\nevening sky\u2019 is false at those other worlds. That is why\n\u2018Hesperus = the brightest non-lunar object in the evening\nsky\u2019 is true but contingently so. \u2018P =\nC\u2019, on the other hand, contains two rigid designators.\n\u2018P\u2019 is a name for that very pain, and so rigidly\ndesignates it. \u2018C\u2019 is a name for that very brain\nevent, and so rigidly designates it. Because \u2018P\u2019\nand \u2018C\u2019 are both rigid designators,\n\u2018P = C\u2019 has to be true of necessity if\nit is true at all. Since it is not true of necessity, it is not true\nat all.\n\n\nSome premises in this bare-bones argument are in obvious need of\nsupport, like the modal intuition that P and C could\nhave existed each in the absence of the other. Support has been\nprovided and rejected by different writers. Many philosophers who\nreject anti-materialist arguments along these lines nevertheless make\nuse of rigid designation as a resource in order to frame\nmaterialist views that recognize a parallel between\n\u2018P = C\u2019 and \u2018Water =\nH2O\u2019.\n\nKripke\u2019s views concerning the philosophy of mind could hardly be\ncalled popular. But, as the introduction to an edited volume covering\nthe topic says, \u201cEven authors who disagree with Kripke\u2019s\nfundamental picture tend to present their arguments against an\nimplicitly or explicitly Kripkean backdrop\u201d (Gendler and Hawthorne 2002, p. 26).\n",
