    "main_text": "\n\n\nPhenomenology is the study of structures of consciousness as\nexperienced from the first-person point of view. The central structure\nof an experience is its intentionality, its being directed toward\nsomething, as it is an experience of or about some object. An\nexperience is directed toward an object by virtue of its content or\nmeaning (which represents the object) together with appropriate\nenabling conditions.\n\n\nPhenomenology as a discipline is distinct from but related to other\nkey disciplines in philosophy, such as ontology, epistemology, logic,\nand ethics. Phenomenology has been practiced in various guises for\ncenturies, but it came into its own in the early 20th century in the\nworks of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty and others.\nPhenomenological issues of intentionality, consciousness, qualia, and\nfirst-person perspective have been prominent in recent philosophy of\nmind.\n",
