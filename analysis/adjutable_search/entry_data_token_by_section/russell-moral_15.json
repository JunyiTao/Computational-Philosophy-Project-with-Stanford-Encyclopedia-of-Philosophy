(RoE: 149/Papers 11:\n51)\n\n\nIn particular, he found himself \u201cincapable of believing that all\nthat is wrong with wanton cruelty is that I don\u2019t like it\u201d. Why\nthen was he an emotivist? Because he could not \u201csee how to\nrefute the arguments for the subjectivity of ethical values\u201d\n(RoE: 165/Papers 11: 310\u2013311). What were these\narguments and why did Russell find them so compelling?\n",
