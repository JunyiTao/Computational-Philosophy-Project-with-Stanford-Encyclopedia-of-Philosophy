To take a simple example from Hart\n(1982, 191\u201392), your city council lacks the Hohfeldian power to\naward you a pension; so by definition you have a Hohfeldian immunity\nagainst your city council awarding you a pension. Yet it would be odd\nto say that you have a right against your city council awarding you a\npension. You thus have an immunity, but not a right. Not all\n(collections of) Hohfeldian incidents are rights; it is only those\n(collections of) Hohfeldian incidents that have a certain\nfunction (or perhaps certain functions) that are rights.\nTo take an analogy: all engagement rings are rings, but only rings\nwith a certain function are engagement rings. What, then, is the\nfunction of rights?\n\nThe question of the function of rights is the question of what rights\ndo for those who hold them. Before discussing the two major positions\non this issue, we can survey some statements that theorists have made\nthat may appear to be describing which Hohfeldian incidents are\nrights:\n\nTo have a right is to have a \u201cvalid claim.\u201d (Feinberg\n1970, 257)\n\u201cIn the strictest sense\u201d all rights are claims.\n(Hohfeld 1919, 36) \n\u201cRights are built around the claims of patients on an\nagent.\u201d (Walen 2019, 58) \n\u201cA right, in the most important sense, is the conjunction of\na [privilege] and a claim-right.\u201d (Mackie 1979, 169)\n\u201cRights are permissions rather than requirements. Rights\ntell us what the bearer is at liberty to do.\u201d (Louden 1983,\n95)\n\u201cNo one ever has a right to do something; he only has a\nright that some one else shall do (or refrain from doing)\nsomething.\u201d (Williams 1968, 125)\n\u201cA person who says to another \u2018I have a right to do\nit\u2019 is not saying that \u2026 it is not wrong to do it. He is\nclaiming that the other has a duty not to interfere.\u201d (Raz 1994,\n275)\n\u201cA right is an established way of acting.\u201d (Martin\n1993, 1)\n\u201cIt is hard to think of rights except as capable of\nexercise.\u201d (Hart 1982, 185)\n\u201cA right is a power which a creature ought to\npossess.\u201d (Plamenatz 1938, 82)\n\u201cAll rights are essentially property rights.\u201d (Steiner\n1994, 93)\n\u201cRights are themselves property, things we\nown.\u201d (Feinberg 1973, 75)\n\n\nAt first, this survey might remind one the proverb of the blind men,\neach of whom is feeling a different part of an elephant. However, we\nshould distinguish between two different aims that a theorist might\nhave when she makes a statement of the form \u201cAll rights are\nx.\u201d A theorist may be attempting to analyze\nthe meaning of our ordinary concept of rights, or she may be\nstipulating a definition of \u201crights\u201d within her\nown ethical, political or legal theory.\n\nConsider, for example, Mill\u2019s famous assertion in\nUtilitarianism:\n\n\nWhen we call anything a person\u2019s right, we mean that he has a\nvalid claim on society to protect him in the possession of it, either\nby the force of law, or by that of education and opinion\u2026 To\nhave a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which society\nought to defend me in the possession of. (Mill 1861, 54)\n\n\nAs an analysis of the everyday concept of a right, Mill\u2019s\nassertion would be weak. For example, for centuries many people have\nasserted that God has the right to command man; yet presumably no one\nwho asserts such a right would commit to the idea that society ought\nto defend God in the possession of the power to command. To take\nanother example, there seems nothing incoherent in the thought that\nindividuals have a right not to be protected by society; yet this\nthought could not make sense on Mill\u2019s characterization of what\nrights are. (On Mill, see also Hart 1982, 100\u201304.)\n\nMill\u2019s statement is better seen not as an analysis of the\neveryday concept, but as a stipulative definition of the term\n\u201cright.\u201d Mill stipulates this particular definition\nbecause the idea of \u201cthose possessive relations that are\nvaluable enough that it is worthwhile for society to institute\nsanctions to protect them\u201d is an idea that works well within his\nlarger utilitarian theory. So where Mill\u2019s statement departs\nfrom the common understanding of rights, we should charitably read\nMill as prescribing, instead of describing, usage. Many authors\u2019\npronouncements about rights are charitably interpreted as these kinds\nof exercises in stipulation, rather than as attempts to analyze the\nordinary concept of rights.\n\nTo take an example from the scholarly literature, it is not uncommon\nto encounter a general statement that all rights are (or at least\ninclude) claim-rights (see, e.g., Raz 1986, 166, 173\u201375;\nSteiner, 1994, 55; Kramer, Steiner and Simmonds 1999, 9\u201314).\nThese \u201call rights are claims\u201d statements are better\ninterpreted as stipulative, rather than as analyses of common usage.\n\u201cAll rights are claims\u201d positions cannot recognize, for\nexample, the rights in the Hobbesian state of nature, in which each\nperson has unlimited privilege-rights of self-defense yet no\nclaim-rights against attack. Neither could an \u201call rights are\nclaims\u201d theory recognize that the US Constitution gives Congress\nthe sole (power-) right to declare war. The statement that rights are\nclaims is prescriptive for, not descriptive of, usage.\n\nOccasionally a theorist will say that she is presenting neither an\nanalysis of the ordinary concept of a right, nor merely stipulating a\nnew meaning for the term \u201cright,\u201d but is rather offering\nsome third type of characterization. For instance, Wellman (1995, 136)\nsays that his narrow specification of \u201ca right\u201d is needed\nto provide \u201ca clearer and more revealing map of the law.\u201d\nRaz (1986, 166) frames a contrasting \u201cphilosophical\ndefinition\u201d that, he says, \u201cilluminates a tradition of\npolitical and moral discourse in which different theories offer\nincompatible views of what rights there are and why.\u201d Whether\nthere is room for such a third category of \u201cphilosophical\ndefinition,\u201d which goes beyond both ordinary analysis and\nstipulation, is contested (Wenar 2008).\n2.2.2 The Will Theory and the Interest Theory\n\nThere are two main theories of the function of rights: the will theory\nand the interest theory. Each theory presents itself as capturing an\nordinary understanding of what rights do for those who hold them.\nWhich theory offers the better account of the functions of rights has\nbeen the subject of spirited dispute, literally for ages.\n\nWill theorists maintain that a right makes the rightholder \u201ca\nsmall scale sovereign\u201d (Hart 1982, 183). More specifically, a\nwill theorist asserts that the function of a right is to give its\nholder control over another\u2019s duty. Your property right\ndiagrammed in the figure above is a right, says the will theorist,\nbecause it contains a power to waive (or annul, or transfer)\nothers\u2019 duties. You are the \u201csovereign\u201d of your\ncomputer, in that you may permit others to touch it or not at your\ndiscretion. Similarly a promisee is \u201csovereign\u201d over the\naction of the promisor: a promisee has a right because she has the\npower to waive (or annul) the promisor\u2019s duty to keep the\npromise. In Hohfeldian terms, will theorists assert that every right\nincludes a Hohfeldian power over a claim. In colloquial terms, will\ntheorists believe that all rights confer control over others\u2019\nduties to act in particular ways.\n\nInterest theorists disagree. Interest theorists maintain that the\nfunction of a right is to further the right-holder\u2019s interests.\nAn owner has a right, according to the interest theorist, not because\nowners have choices, but because the ownership makes owners better\noff. A promisee has a right because promisees have some interest in\nthe performance of the promise, or (alternatively) some interest in\nbeing able to form voluntary bonds with others. Your rights, the\ninterest theorist says, are the Hohfeldian incidents you have that are\ngood for you.\n\nThe contest between will-based and interest-based theories of the\nfunction of rights has been waged for hundreds of years. Influential\nwill theorists include Kant, Savigny, Hart, Kelsen, Wellman, and\nSteiner. Important interest theorists include Bentham, Ihering,\nAustin, Lyons, MacCormick, Raz, and Kramer. Each theory has stronger\nand weaker points as an account of what rights do for\nrightholders.\n\nThe will theory captures the powerful link between rights and\nnormative control. To have a right is to have the ability to determine\nwhat others may and may not do, and so to exercise authority over a\ncertain domain of affairs. The resonant connection between rights and\nauthority (the authority to control what others may do) is for will\ntheorists a matter of definition.\n\nHowever, the will theory\u2019s account of the function of rights\nstruggles to explain many rights that most think there are. Within the\nwill theory, there can be no such thing as an unwaivable right: a\nright over which its holder has no power. Yet intuitively it would\nappear that unwaivable rights are some of the most important rights\nthat we have: consider, for example, the unwaivable right not to be\nenslaved (MacCormick 1977, 197). Moreover, since the will theorist\nholds that all rights confer sovereignty, she cannot acknowledge that\nbeings incapable of exercising sovereignty have rights. Within the\nwill theory, it is impossible for incompetents like infants, animals,\nand comatose adults to have rights. Yet we ordinarily would not doubt\nthat these incompetents can have rights, for example the right not to\nbe tortured (MacCormick 1982, 154\u201366). Will theories also have\ndifficulties explaining bare privilege-rights (such as in the\nHobbesian state of nature), which are not rights of authority over\nothers.\n\nThe interest theory is more capacious than the will theory. It can\naccommodate both unwaivable rights (the possession of which may be\ngood for their holders) and the rights of incompetents (who have\ninterests that rights can protect). The interest theory also taps into\nthe deeply plausible connection between holding rights and being\nbetter off.\n\nHowever, the interest theory is also misaligned with any ordinary\nunderstanding of rights. We commonly accept that people can have\ninterests in x without having a right to x; and\ncontrariwise that people can have a right to x without having\ninterests sufficient to explain this. In the first category are\n\u201cthird party beneficiaries\u201d (Lyons 1994, 36\u201346). You\nmay have a powerful interest in the lottery paying out for your\nspouse\u2019s winning ticket, but you have no right that the lottery\npays out to your spouse. In the second category are many of the rights\nof office-holders and role-bearers (Jones 1994, 31\u201332; Wenar\n2013b). Whatever interest a judge may have in sentencing a convict to\nlife in prison, the judge\u2019s interests cannot justify ascribing\nto her the power to make such a dramatic change in the convict\u2019s\nnormative situation.\n\nThe difficulties of the interest theory have often been noted in\nRaz\u2019s version, which is perhaps the most prominent. In\nRaz\u2019s account, \u201cX has a right if X can have rights, and,\nother things being equal, an aspect of X\u2019s well-being (his\ninterest) is a sufficient reason for holding some other person(s) to\nbe under a duty\u201d (Raz 1986, 166).\n\nYet there appear to be many rights for which the interests of the\nputative right-holder are not sufficient to hold other person(s) to be\nunder a duty. For example, Raz himself notices that the interest of a\njournalist in protecting his sources is not itself sufficient reason\nto hold others to be under a duty not to pressure the journalist to\nreveal his sources (Raz 1986, 179, 247\u20138). Raz says that it is\nrather the interests of the general public in an active and\nindependent media that grounds the journalist\u2019s right to protect\nhis sources. Yet as Kamm then objects to Raz, \u201cIf the\nsatisfaction of the interests of others is the reason why the\njournalist gets a right to have his interest protected, his interest\nis not sufficient to give rise to the duty of noninterference\nwith his speech\u201d (Kamm 2002, 485; for a defense of Raz, see\nPallikkathayil 2016).\n\nNor does this difficulty only affect the rights of office-holders like\njournalists; Raz admits that weighty rights such as the rights of free\nexpression and freedom of contract are not justified solely by the\ninterests of the individual citizens who hold them, but also by the\nways that these rights further the common good (Raz 1995,\n30\u201343, 131). Or again, parents may have the right to receive\nchild benefit payments from the state, but here only the interests of\nthe children, and not the interests of the parents, could be\nsufficient to hold the state to be under a duty.\n\nRaz\u2019s version of the interest theory continues to be the most\nwidely-cited account of the function of rights, despite such concerns\nthat are now commonplace in the specialist literature. Kramer\u2019s\nversion of the interest theory, which specifies necessary conditions\nfor holding a legal right, is the major contemporary alternative\n(Kramer 2013, 2017).\n\nWill theorists and interest theorists have developed their positions\nwith increasing technical sophistication. The issues that divide the\ntwo camps are clearly defined, and the debates between them are often\nintense (Kramer, Simmonds, and Steiner 1998, Van Duffel 2012a, Kramer\n2013, McBride 2017, Frydrych 2018). The seemingly interminable debate\nbetween these two major theories has driven some to conclude that the\ndebate itself rests on the mistaken premise that there is a single\nconcept of a right for which these theories provide rival analyses\n(Van Duffel 2012b, Hayward 2013). The deadlock has encouraged other\ntheorists to develop alternative positions on the function of\nrights.\n\n\u201cDemand\u201d theories fill out the idea that, as Feinberg\n(1973, 58\u201359) puts it, \u201cA right is something a man can\nstand on, something that can be demanded or insisted upon without\nembarrassment or shame.\u201d For Darwall (2006, 18), to have a\nclaim-right, \u201cincludes a second-personal authority to resist,\ncomplain, remonstrate, and perhaps use coercive measures of other\nkinds, including, perhaps, to gain compensation if the right is\nviolated.\u201d On Skorupski\u2019s account (2010, XII.6,\nXIV.2\u20133) rights specify what the right-holder may demand of\nothers, where \u201cdemand\u201d implies the permissibility of\ncompelling performance or exacting compensation for non-performance.\nLike the will theory, these demand theories center on the agency of\nthe right-holder. They do not turn on the right-holder\u2019s power\nover the duty of another, so they do not share the will theory\u2019s\ndifficulty with unwaivable rights. They may, however, have more\ndifficulties in explaining power-rights. Demand theories also share\nthe will-theory\u2019s challenges in explaining the rights of\nincompetents, and in explaining privilege-rights. \n\nGilbert (2018) develops not a demand theory of rights, but a theory of\na special class of rights that she calls \u201cdemand-rights.\u201d\nIn her formulation, \u201cX has a demand-right against Y if and only\nif X has the standing to demand of Y that Y \u03c6\u201d (2018, 70).\nGilbert\u2019s paradigm of a demand-right is a promissory right: the\npromisee has the standing to demand performance from the promisor,\nmeaning that the promisee has the authority to demand that the\npromisor do what she promised to do. Gilbert explains this standing to\ndemand in terms of her theory of joint commitment (2013).\n\nOther analyses of what rights do for rightholders are varied. Scanlon\n(2003, 2013) defends the position that rights are constraints on the\ndiscretion of individuals or institutions to act. Sreenivasan (2005,\n2010) puts forward a \u201chybrid\u201d analysis of the claim-right\nthat grafts the interest theory onto the will theory: here the\nfunction of the claim-right is to endow the right-holder with the\namount of control over another\u2019s duty that advances her\ninterests. Wenar (2005) abandons the idea that all rights have any\nsingle function, and sets out a \u201cseveral functions\u201d theory\non which rights perform six distinct functions. Wenar (2013b) then\nsets out a \u201ckind desire\u201d theory of claim-rights, which\nturns on what role-bearers like journalists and parents want as such,\nand more generally on what beings (like humans) want qua the kinds of\nbeings that they are.\n\nScanlon\u2019s analysis is criticized in Gilbert (2004), Wenar\n(2013a); Sreenivasan\u2019s and Wenar\u2019s analyses are critiqued\nin Kramer and Steiner (2007), May (2012). Kramer\u2019s,\nSreenivasan\u2019s and Wenar\u2019s theories are criticized and\ndeveloped in essays by Kramer, May, Penner, Sreenivasan, McBride, and\nCruft in McBride (2017); Kramer\u2019s theory is modified in Kurki\n(2018); Wenar\u2019s theory is defended in Schaab (2018).\n2.2.3 The Direction of a Duty\n\nRecently, theorists have attempted to make progress on the question of\nthe function of rights by scrutinizing the claim-right in particular,\nand by shifting attention onto the duty that corresponds to it. As\nabove, on the standard account what is distinctive about the\nclaim-right is that a duty-bearer\u2019s duty is \u201cdirected\nat\u201d or \u201cowed to\u201d the right-holder. (The promisor,\nfor example, owes a duty of performance to the promisee.) Yet what\ncould account for the directionality of such \u201cdirected\nduties\u201d? (May 2015)\n\nAfter all, not all duties are directed to specific others. For\nexample, the moral duty of affluent people to give some of their\nwealth to charity is not owed to any specific person. And\n\u201cdirected duties\u201d appear to have special normative\nsignificance. The violation of any duty may be wrong (it may be\nwrong for a rich person to give nothing to charity). But the violation\nof a directed duty is more than just a wrong: it is a wronging\nof the being to whom the duty is owed (Thompson 2004). And unlike a\nmere wrong, the wronging of some being calls, ceteris paribus,\nfor apology and compensation. Cruft (2013) further argues that the\nviolation of any duty owed to a being is disrespectful of that being.\nThe question is what could possibly account for the extra significance\nof the duties that have direction. (Cornell 2015 argues against the\nthesis that one can wrong only those to whom one has directed\nduties.)\n\nDarwall (2012) argues that his second-personal theory of morality best\nexplains the relation between duty-bearer and right-holder. (Yet see\nVankieken 2019.) Cruft (2019) agrees that the directed duty-bearer is\nrequired by the nature of her duty to conceive of the right-holder\nsecond-personally, as \u201cyou, on whom I act.\u201d Cruft then\ndistinguishes natural and human rights, which are grounded largely by\nthe good of the right-holder, from conventional rights, which are\ngrounded by how they serve people or values besides the right-holder.\nCruft argues that most property rights are conventional, yet seem to\nbe natural in such a dangerously ideological way that we should speak\nof them as not rights at all, but rather merely as involving certain\ncontrollable duties of others.\n",
