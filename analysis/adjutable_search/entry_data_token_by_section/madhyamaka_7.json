    "main_text": "\u015a\u0101ntideva || Life and works\n6.1 Life and works\n\nAccording to traditional biographies, \u015a\u0101ntideva was born the\nson of a king but abandoned the royal household for life as a Buddhist\nmonk. Best estimates of the time of his activity place him at the end\nof the seventh century. His best-known (and most frequently\ntranslated) work is Bodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra (Introduction\nto the practice of enlightenment), also called\nBodhisattvacary\u0101vat\u0101ra (Introduction to the\npractice of the bodhisattva). He also compiled\n\u015aik\u1e63\u0101samuccaya, an annotated collection of\npassages from Mah\u0101y\u0101na scriptures for students, and he\nauthored a commentary to Vasubandhu\u2019s\nTri\u1e43\u015bik\u0101, a key text in the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra tradition. Partly because he was a masterful\nstylist and wrote delightfully beautiful Sanskrit verse, and partly\nbecause his work exerted a strong influence on Tibetan Buddhism,\n\u015aantideva has been the focus of a considerable amount of modern\nscholarship in Japan, Europe and North America. All this makes him a\ngood access point into Madhyamaka philosophy for those who are not\nspecialists in Indian philosophy.\n\nBodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra is a verse composition divided\ninto ten chapters, each dealing with a different aspect of the\ntraditional depiction of the bodhisattva\u2019s career. The topics of\nthe ten chapters are as follows:\n\nIn praise of bodhicitta, the aspiration to become\nenlightened for the liberation of all sentient beings\nA reflection on cultivating good character through the confession\nof one\u2019s personal shortcomings\nOn acquiring bodhicitta\nOn cultivating watchfulness with respect to\nbodhicitta\nOn the guarding of awareness\nOn the perfection of patience\nOn the perfection of courage\nOn the perfection of meditation\nOn the perfection of wisdom\nOn giving the merits accrued by cultivating virtues to all those\nsuffering beings in need of merit\n\n\nAs is the case with most philosophical works written in verse,\nBodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra is usually studied with a prose\ncommentary. \u015a\u0101ntideva himself provided no prose commentary\nto his work, but a Sanskrit commentary by Praj\u00f1\u0101karamati\nis still extant and is usually consulted by those who translate the\nwork into English from the original Sanskrit.\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s work is also preserved in Tibetan\ntranslation and is furnished with several Tibetan commentaries, which\nare routinely consulted by those who translate\nBodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra into English from its Tibetan\ntranslation.\n",
