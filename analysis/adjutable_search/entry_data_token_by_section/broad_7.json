    "main_text": "Time\n3. Time\n\nIt is possible to distinguish roughly three different phases in\nBroad\u2019s philosophy of time.\n\nIn his (1921a) Broad defends a Russellian theory of time. On this\nEternalist view past, present, and future are equally real.\nThere is nothing ontologically special about the present: the present\nis no more real than the past or the future. Accordingly Broad rejects\nPresentism\u2014the view that only the present is\nreal\u2014as \u201cmere rhetoric rooted in confusion\u201d (1921a,\np. 226). Presentism has its roots in two errors. One of these errors\nis to equivocate between two different senses of\n\u201cco-existence\u201d. \u201cIn one sense the parts of any\nrelated whole co-exist; in another only those events that occupy the\nsame moment of time co-exist.\u201d The whole course of the history\nobviously cannot co-exist in the latter sense, but this does not\n\u201cprevent it from co-existing in the first\u201d. The other\nerror is to believe that \u201cpast, present, and future are\nessential characteristics of objects in time in the same way as before\nand after are, instead of being analysable into the temporal relations\nof states of mind and their objects\u201d (p. 337). Thus Broad\nrejects the view that past, present, and future are characteristics\npossessed by objects in time. These \u201ccharacteristics\u201d are\na mere reflection of our subjective perspective on objects. Some of\nour mental states are essentially contemporary or\nsimultaneous with their objects, e.g. our immediate awareness\nof sense data. Other states are essentially later than their\nobjects, e.g. memories. (Cf. p. 336.) A related, and perhaps more\nimportant facet of Broad\u2019s (1921a) position here, is his\nadoption of a Russellian analysis of tensed discourse. According to\nthis analysis\u2014versions of which were later to become\northodox\u2014the function of tensed verbs or temporal adjectives in\ntensed statements is performed in the analysans by a tenseless copula,\nIS, and a temporal relation\u2014earlier than,\nsimultaneous with, or later than. Thus \u201cIt is\nraining\u201d (or \u201cIt is raining now\u201d) is unpacked as\n\u201cIt IS raining at a moment simultaneous with my assertion that\nit is raining\u201d; \u201cIt has rained\u201d (or \u201cIt rained\nin the past\u201d) is analysed as \u201cIt IS raining at a moment\nearlier than my assertion that it has rained\u201d; \u201cIt will\nrain\u201d (or \u201cIt will rain in the future\u201d) is read as\n\u201cIt IS raining at a moment later than my assertion that it will\nrain\u201d. (Cf. p. 331.)\n\nIn Scientific Thought (1923) Broad rejects the Eternalism he\nhad defended in his (1921a) article. He now advances a theory that\n\u201caccepts the reality of the present and the past, but holds that\nthe future is simply nothing at all\u201d (1923, p. 66). An\nall-important corollary of this Growing Block Theory is the\nthesis that temporal passage is a fundamental feature of\nreality. This feature is accounted for in terms of what Broad holds is\nthe most fundamental form of change, becoming. Becoming is\nthe coming into existence of events.\n\nNothing has happened to the present by becoming past except that fresh\nslices of existence have been added to the total history of the world.\nThe past is thus as real as the present. On the other hand, the\nessence of a present event is, not that it precedes future events, but\nthat there is quite literally nothing to which it has the\nrelation of precedence. The sum total of existence is always\nincreasing, and it is this which gives the time-series a sense [i.e.\ndirection] as well as an order. A moment t is later than a\nmoment t* if the sum total of existence at t\nincludes the sum total of existence t* together with\nsomething more. (1923, p. 66\u20137; Broad\u2019s italics.)\n\n\nAn event is present by virtue of being the most recent\nincrement of reality; when the event is present there is, as Broad\nsays, nothing to which it stands in the relation of precedence. The\nevent becomes past by virtue of acquiring new relations, and\nit acquires these relations because the sum total of existence has\nbeen increased by the addition of fresh slices of reality. Temporal\npassage is the continual growth of the sum total of\nexistence.[10]\n\nOne of the rivalling views on time Broad discusses is a theory that\nmight be labeled The Moving Spotlight Theory. The Moving\nSpotlight Theory accepts the eternalist view that the past, the\npresent, and the future are equally real; it regards \u201cthe\nhistory of the world as existing eternally in a certain order of\nevents.\u201d But it differs from the Russellian theory in that it\naccepts presentness as an irreducible feature of reality. So the fact\nthat the leaf is falling now is not to be analysed as the fact that\nthe event is simultaneous with an utterance or a specific type of\nmental state. The theory claims that presentness is a characteristic\nmoving along the order of events: \u201cAlong [the order of events],\nand in a fixed direction, [\u2026] the characteristic of presentness\n[is] moving, somewhat like the spot of light from a policeman\u2019s\nbull\u2019s-eye traversing the fronts of the houses in a street. What\nis illuminated is the present, what has been illuminated is the past,\nand what has not yet been illuminated is the future\u201d (1923, p.\n59).\n\nBroad is critical of this theory. To understand the nature of time,\nThe Moving Spotlight Theory makes use of a spatial analogy. Such\nanalogies \u201cmay be useful for some purposes, but it is clear that\nthey explain nothing.\u201d Firstly, Broad asks us to consider the\nsuccessive lighting of presentness\u2014now on one event and now on\nanother, and so on. This is itself an event (or a series of\nevents), \u201cand ought therefore to be a part of the series of\nevents, and not simply something that happens to the latter from\noutside\u201d (1923, p. 60). If we suppose (as we seem compelled to)\nthat it is not a part of the original series of events, we are\nlaunched on a vicious regress of time-dimensions. For then the\nsuccessive lightning of later events would have to be conceived of as\nan event of the second order\u2014happening in a\ntime-dimension different from the original one formed by the series of\nfirst-order events. Secondly he presents a related line of\nreasoning\u2014sometimes termed The Rate of Passage\nArgument: If anything moves, it must move with some determinate\nvelocity. It will always be sensible to ask \u2018How fast does it\nmove?\u2019 But since the series along which presentness is supposed\nto move is itself temporal, this question becomes: \u2018how great a\nlapse of time 1 does presentness traverse in a unit of time 2?\u2019\nAgain, a regress of time-dimensions is imminent. (Both of these\narguments receive a clearer formulation and more extensive treatment\nin Broad\n (1938).)[11]\n\nBroad\u2019s later account of time differs in some significant\nrespects from both of the earlier accounts. He now views what he calls\nabsolute becoming as \u201cthe rock-bottom peculiarity of\ntime\u201d. Absolute becoming manifests itself \u201cas the\ncontinual supersession of what was the latest phase by a new\nphase, which will in turn be superseded by another new one. This seems\nto me to be the rock-bottom peculiarity of time, distinguishing\ntemporal sequence from all other instances of one-dimensional\norder, such as that of points on a line, numbers in order of\nmagnitude, and so on\u201d (1959, p. 766).\n\nThis theory has, in Broad\u2019s opinion, various advantages. One\nadvantage mentioned is that it seems to avoid the difficulties with\nthe rate of times passage\u2014difficulties which besets the\nMoving Spotlight Theory, but arguably also the Growing Block Theory.\nThe proposed theory also avoids presupposing that \u201cwhat has not\nyet supervened and what has already been superseded in some sense\n\u2018co-exist\u2019 with each other and with what is now\noccurring,\u201d which he views as a defect of the Moving Spotlight\nTheory. More interestingly, it avoids what Broad now regards as a\ndefect of the Growing Block Theory, viz. that of presupposing\n\u201cthat phases, which have already supervened and been superseded,\nin some sense \u2018co-exist\u2019 with each other and with that\nwhich is now happening\u201d (1959, p. 767).\n\n(For a book-length study on Broad's philosophy of time, see Oaklander\n2020.)\n",
