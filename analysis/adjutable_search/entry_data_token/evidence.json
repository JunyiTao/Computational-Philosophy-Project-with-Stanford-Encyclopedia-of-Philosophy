Ayer, Philosophy in the Twentieth\nCentury\n\n\nAnd when we try to define \u2018evidence\u2019 \u2026 we find it\nvery difficult.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014R.G. Collingwood, The Idea of\nHistory\n\nThe concept of evidence is central to both epistemology and the\nphilosophy of science. Of course, \u2018evidence\u2019 is hardly a\nphilosopher's term of art: it is not only, or even primarily,\nphilosophers who routinely speak of evidence, but also lawyers and\njudges, historians and scientists, investigative journalists and\nreporters, as well as the members of numerous other professions and\nordinary folk in the course of everyday life. The concept of evidence\nwould thus seem to be on firmer pre-theoretical ground than various\nother concepts which enjoy similarly central standing within\nphilosophy. (Contrast, for example, the epistemologist's\nquasi-technical term \u2018epistemic justification\u2019.)\nWhen one compares philosophical accounts of evidence with the way\nthe concept is often employed in non-philosophical contexts, however,\na tension soon emerges. Consider first the kinds of things which\nnon-philosophers are apt to count as evidence. For the forensics\nexpert, evidence might consist of fingerprints on a gun, a bloodied\nknife, or a semen-stained dress: evidence is, paradigmatically, the\nkind of thing which one might place in a plastic bag and label\n\u2018Exhibit A\u2019. Thus, a criminal defense attorney might float\nthe hypothesis that the evidence which seems to incriminate his client\nwas planted by a corrupt law enforcement official or hope for it to be\nmisplaced by a careless clerk. For an archaeologist, evidence is the\nsort of thing which one might dig up from the ground and carefully\nsend back to one's laboratory for further analysis. Similarly, for the\nhistorian, evidence might consist of hitherto overlooked documents\nrecently discovered in an archive or in an individual's personal\n library.[1]\n Reflection on examples such as these naturally suggests that evidence\nconsists paradigmatically of physical objects, or perhaps, physical\nobjects arranged in certain ways. For presumably, physical objects are\nthe sort of thing which one might place in a plastic bag, dig up from\nthe ground, send to a laboratory, or discover among the belongings of\nan individual of historical interest. \n\n However natural such a picture might be, it is at least somewhat\ndifficult to reconcile with historically prominent philosophical\naccounts of the nature of evidence. Russell, the greatest empiricist\nof the first half of the twentieth century, tended to think of\nevidence as sense data, mental items of one's present\nconsciousness with which one is immediately acquainted. In this, he\nstood squarely within the tradition of classical empiricism. Quine,\nthe greatest empiricist of the second half of the century, maintained\nthroughout his career that evidence consisted of the stimulation of\none's sensory\n receptors.[2]\n The logical positivists held that whatever evidence there is for a\ngiven scientific theory is afforded by observation statements\nor \u2018protocol sentence\u2019, linguistic entities with\nsuitably-restricted contents; the precise nature of the restrictions\nbecame a vigorously contested matter within the tradition\n itself.[3]\n According to one recent and influential study, one's evidence consists\nof the totality of propositions that one knows (Williamson 2000).\nAccording to another, one's evidence consists exclusively of one's current mental states (Conee and Feldman 2004). Within\ncontemporary confirmation theory, a prominent version of Bayesianism is\nnaturally understood as identifying one's evidence with those beliefs\nof which one is psychologically certain. Of course, the suggestion that\none might place sense data, sensory receptor stimulations, known\npropositions, or one's current mental states in a plastic bag (or dig them\nup from the ground, or send them to a laboratory, or \u2026) is of dubious\nintelligibility. From the perspective of much ordinary thought and talk\nabout evidence, much philosophical theorizing about evidence would seem\nto embody a particularly grotesque category mistake. \n\n Moreover, it is not simply that the accounts of evidence that have\nbeen advanced by philosophers stand in at least some prima\nfacie tension with much that is said and thought about evidence\noutside of philosophy. As even the cursory survey offered above makes\nclear, philosophers themselves have offered quite divergent theories\nof what sorts of things are eligible to serve as evidence. What might\naccount for such discrepancies?\n\n One possibility is the following.  Both in and outside of philosophy,\nthe concept of evidence has often been called upon to fill a number of\ndistinct roles. Although some of these roles are complementary, others\nstand in at least some measure of tension with one another. Indeed, as\nwe will see below, it is far from obvious that any one thing could\nplay all of the diverse roles that evidence has at various times been\nexpected to play. Different theories about the nature of evidence\nmight thus naturally emerge from different emphases on the competing\ndemands that have been placed on the concept.  In what follows, I\nsurvey some of the theoretical roles that the concept of evidence has\nbeen asked to play and explore some of the relations among them.\n", "toc": [{"#EviWhiJusBel": "1.

Evidence as That Which Justifies Belief\n\nIn any event, the concept of evidence is inseparable from that of\njustification. When we talk of \u2018evidence\u2019 in an\nepistemological sense we are talking about justification: one thing is\n\u2018evidence\u2019 for another just in case the first tends to\nenhance the reasonableness or justification of the second.\u2026 A\nstrictly nonnormative concept of evidence is not our concept of\nevidence; it is something that we do not understand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Jaegwon Kim, \u2018What is\n\u201cNaturalized Epistemology\u201d?\u2019\n\n\n Evidence, whatever else it is, is the kind of thing which can make a\ndifference to what one is justified in believing or (what is\noften, but not always, taken to be the same thing) what it is\nreasonable for one to believe. Some philosophers hold that\nwhat one is justified in believing is entirely determined by one's\nevidence. This view\u2014which sometimes travels under the banner of\n\u2018Evidentialism\u2019\u2014can be formulated as a supervenience\nthesis, according to which normative facts about what one is justified\nin believing supervene on facts about one's evidence (See especially\nConee and Feldman 2004). Thus, according to the Evidentialist, any two\nindividuals who possessed exactly the same evidence would be exactly\nalike with respect to what they are justified in believing about any\ngiven question.\n\n Given Evidentialism, various traditional debates within the theory of\nknowledge are naturally cast as debates about the status of various\nunderdetermination theses. Thus, the skeptic about our knowledge\nof the external world maintains that one's evidence (understood,\nperhaps, as the totality of one's present experiences) does not favor\none's ordinary, commonsense views about one's surroundings over\nvarious skeptical alternatives (e.g., the hypothesis that one is\nhallucinating in an undetectable way). Similarly, one longstanding\ncontroversy that divides realists and antirealists in the philosophy\nof science can be understood as a debate about whether the kind of\nevidence which is available to scientists is ever sufficient to\njustify belief in theories that quantify over entities that are in\nprinciple unobservable, such as electrons or quarks.\n\n Inasmuch as evidence is the sort of thing which confers\njustification, the concept of evidence is closely related to other\nfundamental normative concepts such as the concept of a\nreason. Indeed, it is natural to think that \u2018reason to\nbelieve\u2019 and \u2018evidence\u2019 are more or less synonymous,\nbeing distinguished chiefly by the fact that the former functions\ngrammatically as a count noun while the latter functions as a mass\n term.[4] \n\n To the extent that what one is justified in believing depends upon\none's evidence, what is relevant is the bearing of one's\ntotal evidence. Even if evidence E is sufficient to\njustify believing hypothesis H when considered in isolation,\nit does not follow that one who possesses evidence E is\njustified in believing H on its basis. For one might possess\nsome additional evidence E\u2032, such that one is not\njustified in believing H given E and\nE\u2032. In these circumstances, evidence E\u2032\ndefeats the justification for believing H that would\nbe afforded by E in its absence. Thus, even if I am initially\njustified in believing that your name is Fritz on the basis\nof your testimony to that effect, the subsequent acquisition of\nevidence which suggests that you are a pathological liar tends to\nrender this same belief unjustified. A given piece of evidence is\ndefeasible evidence just in case it is in principle\nsusceptible to being undermined by further evidence in this way;\nevidence which is not susceptible to such undermining would be\nindefeasible evidence. It is controversial whether any\nevidence is indefeasible in this\n sense.[5]\n\n Following Pollock (1986), we can distinguish between\nundercutting and rebutting defeaters. Intuitively,\nwhere E is evidence for H, an undercutting defeater\nis evidence which undermines the evidential connection between\nE and H. Thus, evidence which suggests that you are\na pathological liar constitutes an undercutting defeater for your\ntestimony: although your testimony would ordinarily afford excellent\nreason for me to believe that your name is Fritz, evidence\nthat you are a pathological liar tends to sever the evidential\nconnection between your testimony and that to which you testify. In\ncontrast, a rebutting defeater is evidence which prevents E\nfrom justifying belief in H by supporting not-H in a\nmore direct way. Thus, credible testimony from another source that\nyour name is not Fritz but rather Leopold constitutes a rebutting\ndefeater for your original testimony. It is something of an open\nquestion how deeply the distinction between \u2018undermining\u2019\nand \u2018rebutting\u2019 defeaters cuts.\n\n Significantly, defeating evidence can itself be defeated by yet\nfurther evidence: at a still later point in time, I might acquire\nevidence E\u2033 which suggests that you are not a\npathological liar after all, the evidence to that effect having been\nan artifice of your sworn enemy. In these circumstances, my initial\njustification for believing that your name is Fritz afforded by the\noriginal evidence E is restored. In principle, there is no\nlimit to the complexity of the relations of defeat that might obtain\nbetween the members of a given body of evidence. Such complexity is\none source of our fallibility in responding to evidence in the\nappropriate way. \n\n In order to be justified in believing some proposition then, it is\nnot enough that that proposition be well-supported by some proper\nsubset of one's total evidence; rather, what is relevant is how\nwell-supported the proposition is by one's total evidence. In\ninsisting that facts about what one is justified in believing\nsupervene on facts about one's evidence, the Evidentialist should be\nunderstood as holding that it is one's total evidence that is\nrelevant. Of course, this leaves open questions about what relation\none must bear to a piece of evidence E in order for\nE to count as part of one's total evidence, as well as the\nrelated question of what sorts of things are eligible for inclusion\namong one's total\n evidence.[6]\n\n Given the thesis that evidence is that which justifies belief, one's\nintuitions about the evidence that is available to an individual in a\nhypothetical scenario will shape one's views about what the individual\nwould be justified in believing in that scenario. Of course, one can\nalso theorize in the opposite direction as well: to the extent that\none has independent intuitions about what an individual would be\njustified in believing in a given scenario, such intuitions will shape\none's views about what evidence must be available to an individual so\nsituated\u2014and therefore, one's views about the more general\ntheoretical issue about what evidence is, or what sorts of things can\nand cannot qualify as evidence. Thus, if one is firmly convinced that\nan individual in circumstances C might be justified in\nbelieving that p is the case, it follows immediately that\nbeing in circumstances of kind C is consistent with having\nevidence sufficient to justify the belief that p. As we will\nsee below (Section 2), reasoning of this general form has often\nencouraged a picture according to which one's total evidence is\nexhausted by one's present experiences.\n\n Here is an example of the way in which intuitions about justification\ncan drive one's account of evidence, given a commitment to the\nEvidentialist thesis that changes in what an individual is justified\nin believing always reflect changes in her total evidence. It is\nsometimes suggested that how confident a scientist is justified in\nbeing that a given hypothesis is true depends, not only on the\ncharacter of relevant data to which she has been exposed, but also on\nthe space of alternative hypotheses of which she is aware. According\nto this line of thought, how strongly a given collection of data\nsupports a hypothesis is not wholly determined by the content of the\ndata and the hypothesis. (Nor is it wholly determined by their content\ntogether with the scientist's background theory of how the world\nworks.) Rather, it also depends upon whether there are other plausible\ncompeting hypotheses in the field. It is because of this that the mere\narticulation of a plausible alternative hypothesis can dramatically\nreduce how likely the original hypothesis is on the available\n data.[7] \n\n Consider an historical example that is often thought to illustrate\nthis phenomenon. Many organisms manifest special characteristics that\nenable them to flourish in their typical environments. According to\nthe Design Hypothesis, this is due to the fact that such\norganisms were designed by an Intelligent Creator (i.e., God). The\nDesign Hypothesis is a potential explanation of the relevant facts: if\ntrue, it would account for the facts in question. How much support do\nthe relevant facts lend to the Design Hypothesis? Plausibly, the\nintroduction of the Darwinian Hypothesis as a competitor in the\nnineteenth century significantly diminished the support enjoyed by the\nDesign Hypothesis. That is, even if there were no reason to\nprefer the Darwinian Hypothesis to the Design Hypothesis, the\nmere fact that the Design Hypothesis was no longer the only potential\nexplanation in the field tends to erode (to some extent at least) how\nmuch credence the Design Hypothesis merits on the basis of the\nrelevant considerations.\n\n Assume for the sake of illustration that what one is justified in\nbelieving does in fact depend upon the space of alternative hypotheses\nof which one is aware: as new hypotheses are introduced, one's\njustification for believing already proposed hypotheses changes. Given\nthe Evidentialist thesis that differences in justification are always\nunderwritten by differences in evidence, it follows that a complete\nspecification of one's evidence at any given time will make reference\nto the set of hypotheses which one is aware of at that time. This is\nan example of the way in which intuitive judgments about what\nindividuals are justified in believing in certain circumstances, when\ncoupled with a commitment to Evidentialism, can drive one's theory of\nevidence (i.e., make a difference to which items one classifies as\n\u2018evidence\u2019 in one's theorizing).\n\n The justifying or rationalizing role of evidence is also central to\nother prominent epistemological views, including views which are\nstrictly speaking incompatible with Evidentialism as formulated\nabove. Consider, for example, Bayesianism. (See the entry on\n Bayesian epistemology.)\n The Bayesian holds that what it is reasonable for one to believe\ndepends both on the evidence to which one is exposed as well as on\none's prior probability distribution. According to the Bayesian then,\ntwo individuals who share exactly the same total evidence might differ\nin what it is reasonable for them to believe about some question in\nvirtue of having started with different prior probability\ndistributions. Still, inasmuch as Bayesians often focus upon rational\nbelief change, or on what is involved in rationally revising\none's beliefs over time, the justificatory role of evidence retains a\ncertain pride of place within the Bayesian scheme. For Bayesians\ntypically maintain that that which distinguishes those changes in\none's beliefs that are reasonable from those that are not is that the\nformer, unlike the latter, involve responding to newly-acquired\nevidence in an appropriate\n way.[8]\n Thus, for the Bayesian no less than for the Evidentialist, it is\nevidence which justifies that which stands in need of justification. \n\n Notably, even views which tend to marginalize the role of a subject's\nevidence in determining facts about what he or she is justified in\nbelieving typically do not take facts about the subject's evidence to\nbe wholly irrelevant. Consider, for example, reliabilist\ntheories of epistemic justification (Goldman 1979, 1986). In its\npurest and most straightforward form, reliabilism holds that the\nstatus of a token belief as justified or unjustified depends upon\nwhether or not the psychological process which gives rise to the\nbelief is a reliable one, i.e., one that is truth-conducive. When\nformulated in this way, the concept of evidence plays no role in the\nreliabilist account of justification: in particular, the status of a\ngiven belief as justified or unjustified depends upon whether the\nrelevant belief-forming process is in fact reliable, and not on\nany evidence which the believer might possess which bears on the\nquestion of its reliability (or even, for that matter, on any evidence\nwhich the believer might possess which bears more directly on the\ntruth of the belief itself). Thus, someone who was in fact a reliable\nclairvoyant would be justified in holding beliefs that she forms on\nthe basis of clairvoyance, even if her total evidence strongly\nsuggested both that (i) she does not possess the faculty of\nclairvoyance, and that (ii) the relevant beliefs are false (BonJour\n1985, Chapter 3). However, in response to such examples, reliabilists\ntypically seek to accommodate the intuition that such a subject is not\njustified in maintaining her reliably-arrived-at beliefs in the face\nof her evidence, and they seek to modify the simple reliabilist\naccount to allow for this (See, e.g., Goldman 1986: 109\u2013112). The felt\nneed to modify the original, more straightforward account is, perhaps,\na testament to the resilience of the idea that one's evidence can make\na difference to what one is justified in believing\u2014even if\nother factors are also taken to be relevant.\n2. Rational Thinkers Respect Their Evidence \n\nA rational man is one who makes a proper use of reason: and this\nimplies, among other things, that he correctly estimates the strength\nof evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Ayer, Probability and Evidence\n\n\nInsofar as we are rational in our beliefs, the intensity of belief\nwill tend to correspond to the firmness of the available\nevidence. Insofar as we are rational, we will drop a belief when we\nhave tried in vain to find evidence for it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Quine and Ullian, The Web of Belief\n\n\nA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014David Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding\n\n\n It is characteristic of rational thinkers to respect their evidence.\nInsofar as one is rational, one is disposed to respond appropriately\nto one's evidence: at any given time, one's views accurately reflect\nthe character of one's evidence at that time, and one's views manifest\na characteristic sensitivity or responsiveness to changes in one's\nevidence through time. Of course, rationality is no guarantee of\ncorrectness. Indeed, in a given case one might be led astray by\nfollowing one's evidence, as when one's evidence is\nmisleading.  But being mistaken is not the same as being\nunreasonable. To the extent that one respects one's evidence, one is\nnot unreasonable even when one is\n wrong.[9] \n\n The foregoing remarks, although bordering on the platitudinous,\nnaturally suggest a substantive model of the norms which govern our\npractice of belief attribution. According to the model in question, in\nattributing beliefs to you, I should, all else being equal, attribute\nto you the belief that p just in case it would be reasonable\nfor you to believe that p given your total evidence. This is\nthe core idea behind one popular version of the Principle of\nCharity. According to this line of thought, I am justified in drawing\ninferences about what you believe on the basis of my knowledge of your\nepistemic situation. Thus, if I know that your evidence strongly\nsuggests that it will rain today, then (all else being equal)\nI should attribute to you the belief that it will rain today. On the\nother hand, if I know that your evidence strongly suggests that it\nwill not rain today, then I should likewise attribute to you\na belief to that effect. Although on a given occasion a thinker who is\ngenerally reasonable might fail to believe in accordance with her\nevidence, such cases are exceptional. In the absence of any reason to\nthink that a given case is exceptional in this way, one is licensed to\ndraw inferences about the contents of another's beliefs on the basis\nof information about the character of her evidence. The default\nassumption is that a person's beliefs are those that it is appropriate\nfor her to hold given the evidence to which she has been exposed.\n\n Above, we noted that in a given case one might be led astray by\nfollowing one's evidence: even if p is true, one's evidence\nmight misleadingly suggest that p is not true. When one's\nevidence is misleading, one typically arrives at a false belief by\nbelieving in accordance with it. We ordinarily assume that such cases\nare exceptional. Are there possible worlds in which such cases are the\nnorm? Consider a careful and judicious thinker who consistently and\nscrupulously attends to his evidence in arriving at his beliefs. In\nour world, these habits lead to cognitive prosperity\u2014the\nindividual holds a relatively large number of true beliefs and\nrelatively few false beliefs. (Or at least, he fares significantly\nbetter with respect to truth and falsity than those who fail to attend\nto their evidence and instead form their beliefs in a hasty or\nhaphazard manner.)  Consider next how the same individual fares in a\nworld that is subject to the machinations of a Cartesian evil demon, a\nbeing bent on deceiving the world's inhabitants as to its true\ncharacter. Although the true character of the world in question\ndiffers radically from our own, it is, from the point of view of its\ninhabitants, utterly indistinguishable, for the Demon takes care to\nensure that the courses of experiences that the inhabitants undergo\nare qualitatively identical to the courses of experiences that they\nundergo in our non-delusory world. In the world run by the Cartesian\nDemon, our thinker is no less judicious and no less scrupulous in\nattending to (what he blamelessly takes to be) relevant considerations\nthan he is in our world. Because of his unfortunate circumstances,\nhowever, his beliefs embody a radically false picture of his\nenvironment. Granted that the thinker's beliefs about his environment\nare false, are they any less justified than in our world? Is the\nthinker himself any less rational? Many philosophers maintain that the\nthinker's beliefs are equally well-justified and that the thinker\nhimself is equally rational in the two worlds (See e.g., Cohen 1984\nand Pryor 2001). Apparently, there is strong intuitive resistance to\nthe idea that a thinker whose underlying dispositions and habits of\nthought remain unchanged might become less rational simply in\nvirtue of being located in less fortuitous circumstances. As\nWilliamson (2000) has forcefully emphasized, however, embracing the\njudgement that the thinker is equally rational in \u2018the good\ncase\u2019 and \u2018the bad case\u2019 tends to push one\ninexorably towards a conception of evidence according to which one's\nevidence is exhausted by one's subjective, non-factive mental\nstates. For if rationality is a matter of responding correctly to\none's evidence, then the judgement that the thinker is equally\nrational in the good case and the bad case would seem to require that\nthe thinker has the same evidence for his beliefs in both cases. But\nex hypothesi, the only thing common to the good case and the\nbad case that is a plausible candidate for being the thinker's\nevidence are his non-factive mental states. Thus, the judgement that\nthe thinker is equally rational in both cases, when conjoined with the\nview that rationality is a matter of responding to one's evidence in\nthe appropriate way, seems to force the conclusion that the thinker's\nevidence is limited to his non-factive mental states even in the\ngood case. In this way, the requirement that the thinker has the\nsame evidence in the good case and the bad case seems to encourage\nwhat Williamson calls \u2018the Phenomenal Conception of\n Evidence\u2019.[10]\n\n Consider also how the aforementioned Principle of Charity encourages\nsuch a picture of evidence when it is applied to the world run by the\nDemon. In attributing beliefs to an individual in the bad case, one\nattributes exactly those beliefs that one would attribute if the same\nindividual were in the good case. For if the Demon's illusions are\ntruly undetectable, failure to detect them hardly seems to constitute\na failure of rationality. In attributing commonsense beliefs\nto the individual in the bad case, one proceeds according to the\nPrinciple of Charity: after all, it seems that these are exactly the\nbeliefs that even a perfectly rational (though not infallible) being\nwould have in the circumstances. But if the commonsense beliefs are no\nless reasonable when held in the bad case, then the individual's\nevidence for those beliefs must be just as strong in the bad case as\nin the good case. Indeed, it is natural to describe the bad case as a\nworld in which the thinker's evidence is systematically\nmisleading. The trick to being a good Evil Demon (one\nmight think) is to be effective at planting misleading\nevidence. Intuitively, the Demon misleads his victims by\nexploiting their rationality, inasmuch as he trades on the\nsensitivity of their beliefs to misleading evidence. (Indeed, those\nwho dogmatically cling to favored theories in the face of apparently\ndisconfirming evidence would seem to be relatively less vulnerable to\nbeing manipulated by the Demon.) But the Demon misleads by providing\nhis victims with misleading experiences. Hence the temptation to\nsimply identify one's evidence with one's experiences: once again, the\nphenomenal conception of evidence looms. \n\n As Williamson emphasizes, the insistence that one's evidence is\nidentical in the good case and the bad case effectively rules out many\notherwise-attractive accounts of evidence:\n\n That one has the same evidence in the good and bad cases is a severe\nconstraint on the nature of evidence. It is inconsistent with the view\nthat evidence consists of true propositions like those standardly\noffered as evidence for scientific theories.\u2026 For similar\nreasons [it] does not permit my evidence to include perceptual states\nindividuated in part by relations to the environment. No matter how\nfavorable my epistemic circumstances, I am counted as having only as\nmuch evidence as I have in the corresponding skeptical scenarios, no\nmatter how distant and bizarre. Retinal stimulations and brain states\nfare no better as evidence, for in some skeptical scenarios they are\nunknowably different too (2000:173).\n \n\n In view of its apparent consequences for the theory of evidence, the\nidea that one's evidence is the same in the good case and the bad case\nwarrants further scrutiny. Again, it is uncontroversial that there is\na robust distinction between nonculpable error on the one hand and\nirrationality or unreasonableness on the other. Nonculpable error does\nnot in general make for irrationality, even when such error is\nrelatively widespread and pervasive. Still, it's worth asking just how\nmuch weight the distinction in question can bear. Is any amount of\nnonculpable error about the environment in which one is embedded\ncompatible with perfect rationality? Or rather, at some point, does a\nsufficient amount of error about one's environment tend to compromise\none's ability to form rational beliefs about that environment?\n\n Here is one line of thought for the conclusion that a sufficient\nlevel of nonculpable error about one's environment does tend\nto compromise one's ability to arrive at rational beliefs about that\nenvironment. It's plausible to suppose that much if not all of the\nvalue that we place on believing rationally depends on a connection\nbetween believing rationally and believing what is true (although the\nprecise nature of this connection is no doubt a particularly vexing\ntopic). One might worry that a view according to which even ideal,\nperfect rationality can coexist harmoniously with a more or less\ncompletely mistaken view of one's situation threatens to attenuate the\nconnection between believing rationally and believing truly too far,\nand to render obscure why the former would be valuable relative to the\nlatter. To put the same point in terms of evidence: plausibly, much if\nnot all of the value of respecting one's evidence consists in the\nputative link between doing so and believing the truth. Given this,\none might worry that a view according to which perfectly following\none's evidence is compatible with a more or less completely mistaken\nview of one's situation threatens to render obscure why following\none's evidence would be a good thing to do relative to the goal of\nhaving true rather than false beliefs.\n\n This line of thought is not decisive, however. In general, the value\nof x might consist in its serving as a means to y,\neven if there are conditions in which relying on x utterly\nfails to bring about (or even frustrates the achievement of)\ny. Thus, it might be that the value of a given drug consists\nin its being the miracle cure for some disease, even though in certain\nconditions the drug would have the effect of aggravating the disease.\nSimilarly, it might be that we value following our evidence as a means\nto believing what is true, even though we recognize that there are\ncircumstances such that, were we unfortunate enough to be in them,\ndoing so would hinder or frustrate that goal.\n\n A different tack is pursued by Williamson, who argues at length that\nwe should not accept the idea that one has the same evidence in the\ngood case and the bad case. Central to his argument is the contention\nthat, even if one were to adopt the phenomenal conception of evidence,\nthis would not allow one to vindicate the underlying intuitions that\nseemed to make its adoption attractive in the first place; hence, the\nphenomenal conception of evidence is ultimately not well-motivated. As\nwe have seen, it is the desire to preserve the intuition that a\nsufficiently scrupulous thinker in the bad case can be reasonable in\nhis beliefs (indeed, no less reasonable than a similarly scrupulous\nthinker in the good case) which seems to rule out any conception of\nevidence according to which one's evidence might consist of (say) true\npropositions or facts about the external world. For a thinker in the\nbad case is not in a position to recognize facts about the external\nworld; he is, however, in a position to recognize facts about his own\nexperiences. The view that one's evidence is limited to one's\nexperiences thus seems to be motivated by the idea that one's\nevidence, no matter what else is true of it, must be the sort of thing\nthat one is always in a position to correctly take into account, at\nleast in principle. But (it is claimed) one's experiences are the\nthings that one is always in a position to correctly take into\naccount. Williamson argues that this last thought is a mistake: in\nfact, one is not always in a position to correctly take into account\none's experiences, even in principle. Indeed, Williamson argues that\nthere is no non-trivial condition which is such that one is\nalways in a position to know that it obtains.  Thus, the thought that\nevidence might be such that one is always in a position to know what\none's evidence is is a chimerical one. To insist that in order for x\nto be among one's evidence, x must be such that one is always in a\nposition to know whether one's evidence includes x is thus to impose a\nmisguided and unrealizable desideratum on the theory of\nevidence. In short: \u2018Whatever evidence is, one is not\nalways in a position to know what one has of it\u2019 (2000: 178,\nemphasis added).\n\n Having\nrejected the phenomenal conception, Williamson proposes that we take a\nsubject's evidence to consist of all and only those propositions that\nthe subject\n knows.[11]\n Williamson elaborates this simple and straightforward idea with great\nsophistication; here we focus exclusively on the way in which the\nresulting theory interacts with the theme that rational thinkers\nrespect their evidence. Of course, one immediate consequence of the\nview that a subject's evidence consists of his knowledge is that a\nthinker in the good case and a thinker in the bad case will\ndiffer\u2014indeed, differ significantly\u2014in the evidence which\nthey possess.  When a thinker in the good case comes to know that\nthere is blood on the knife in virtue of having a visual\nexperience as of blood on the knife, the relevant proposition becomes\npart of his total evidence. In contrast, when a thinker in the bad\ncase is caused by the Demon to undergo the same experience (or at\nleast, an experience that is qualitatively indistinguishable) and\narrives at the same belief, the relevant proposition is not part of\nhis total evidence, for the relevant proposition is not true and hence\nnot known. Inasmuch as the scrupulous thinker in the good case will\nknow far more than the scrupulous thinker in the bad case, the former\nwill have far more evidence for his beliefs than the latter. Given\nthat the two thinkers have the same beliefs, it seems that the thinker\nin the good case will be significantly more reasonable in holding\nthose\n beliefs.[12] \n\n How much of a cost is this? We should distinguish between two\ndifferent intuitions one might have about a thinker in the bad\ncase. The first intuition is that a thinker in the bad case has\nexactly the same evidence as a thinker in the good\ncase. Perhaps abandoning this intuition is not much of a cost (if it\nis any cost at all). A different intuition is the following: when a\nthinker in the bad case takes his experiences at face value and forms\nbeliefs about the external world in the usual manner, those beliefs\nare not simply unreasonable, in the way that they would be if, for\nexample, the thinker adopted those same beliefs on a whim, or in the\nabsence of any reason to do so at all.  Abandoning this intuition\nwould seem to be a much heavier price to pay.  However, it is\ncontentious whether this intuition can be preserved on a view\naccording to which one's evidence consists of one's knowledge.\nConsider, once again, a thinker in the bad case who is caused by the\nDemon to have a visual experience as of being in the presence of a\nbloodied knife. Possessing no reason to doubt that the experience is\nveridical, the thinker forms the belief that there is blood on the\nknife in the usual manner. Intuitively, this belief is at the\nvery least better justified than it would be in the absence of the\nrelevant visual experience. On the supposition that one's evidence\nconsists of those propositions that one knows, we can ask: what known\nproposition or propositions justify this belief, to the extent that it\nis justified?  The proposition that there is blood on the knife is\nfalse and therefore not known. Perhaps the thinker's evidence for his\nbelief that there is blood on the knife is the true proposition that\n(i) it appears that there is blood on the knife or the true\nproposition that (ii) my experience is as of there being blood on\nthe\n knife.[13]\n However, some philosophers maintain that in typical cases of\nperception, one does not form beliefs about how things appear to one,\nor about how one's perceptual experience presents things as being:\nrather, in response to one's experiences, one simply forms beliefs\nabout the external world\n itself.[14]\n If this is correct, then, given that knowledge requires belief,\npropositions like (i) and (ii) are not known because they are not\nbelieved. Hence, if this model is correct, then, on the view that\none's evidence consists only of known propositions, the thinker's\nbelief that there is blood on the knife seems to lack any\n justification.[15]\n\n According to the phenomenal conception of evidence, only\none's experiences can serve as evidence. According to Williamson's\nconception of evidence as knowledge, one's experiences are excluded\nfrom counting as evidence\u2014at best, one's evidence includes\nwhatever propositions about one's experiences that one knows. Even if\none abandons the phenomenal conception of evidence, however, one might\nhold on to the idea that one's evidence includes one's\nexperiences, inasmuch as one's experiences can and often do make some\ndifference to what one is justified in believing, regardless of\nwhether one forms beliefs about those experiences themselves. A view\nof evidence that is more liberal than either Williamson's or the\nphenomenal conception might thus take one's evidence to include both\none's experiences and one's knowledge, on the grounds that the beliefs\nof a rational thinker will exhibit direct sensitivity both to what he\nknows and to the experiences that he undergoes. The question of\nwhether one's experiences\u2014as opposed to one's beliefs about\none's experiences, or one's knowledge of one's\nexperiences\u2014can play a direct role in justifying beliefs\nabout the external world is a much contested one in the philosophy of\nperception; it will not be pursued further here.\n\nAn issue that has recently come to the fore concerns the distinction\nbetween first-order evidence and higher-order\nevidence (Christensen 2010, Feldman 2005, Kelly 2005, 2010,\nLasonen-Aarnio 2014). Intuitively, first-order evidence E is\nevidence that bears directly on some target proposition or hypothesis\nH. Higher-order evidence is evidence about the character\nof E itself, or about subjects' capacities and dispositions for\nresponding rationally to E. Suppose that a trained\nmeteorologist carefully surveys the available meteorological data and\nconcludes that it will rain tomorrow. Here, the\nmeteorological data (E) is first-order evidence that bears on\nthe hypothesis (H), that it will rain tomorrow.  Now\nconsider the fact that the meteorologist arrived at the view that\nit will rain tomorrow on the basis of E. This fact is\nhigher-order evidence, inasmuch as it is evidence about the content\nand import of the original meteorological data E. In\nparticular, given that the meteorologist is generally competent when\nit comes to assessing the relevant kind of evidence, the fact that she\narrived at the view that H on the basis of E is evidence for\nthe epistemic propositions that E supports H. Moreover, at\nleast in many contexts, the fact that the meteorologist arrived at the\nview that H on the basis of E will count as evidence,\nnot only for the epistemic proposition that E supports H, but\nalso for the hypothesis itself, i.e., it will rain\ntomorrow. This seems especially clear in cases in which a third\nparty lacks access to the original meteorological evidence E\n(or is incompetent to assess that evidence) but does know that the\nmeteorologist arrived at the verdict that it will rain\ntomorrow on its basis. In these circumstances, it makes sense for\nthe third party to increase his credence in rain tomorrow, once he\nlearns what the meteorologist has concluded. In effect, in these\ncircumstances, one treats the fact that the meteorologist arrived at\nthe belief that it will rain tomorrow as a kind of proxy for\nthe meteorological evidence to which one lacks access, or which one is\nincompetent to assess (Kelly 2005). Here evidence of evidence\n(for H) is itself evidence for H (Feldman 2005). The\ngeneral lesson is that higher-order evidence sometimes serves as\nevidence that should make a difference not only to what one believes\nabout the first-order evidence, but also to one's beliefs about the\nworld itself.\n\nOther cases, however, are less clear-cut. For example, suppose that a\nsecond trained meteorologist evaluates the available meteorological\ndata E and arrives at her own view about the possibility that\nit will rain tomorrow. She then learns that the first meteorologist\narrived at the view that it will rain tomorrow on the basis of\nevidence E. Should the second meteorologist count her\ncolleague's opinion as additional evidence for the hypothesis\nthat it will rain tomorrow? Or would doing so be in effect to engage\nin a kind of illegitimate double counting of the original evidence\n(Kelly 2005, Matheson 2009)? More generally, in what circumstances,\nexactly, is evidence of evidence (for some proposition) evidence for\nthat proposition (Fitelson 2012, Feldman 2014)? Questions about the\nnature and bearing of higher-order evidence are topics of active\nresearch.\n3. Evidence as a Guide to Truth: Evidence as Sign, Symptom, or Mark\n\nThe situation in which I would properly be said to have\nevidence for the statement that some animal is a pig is that,\nfor example, in which the beast itself is not actually on view, but I\ncan see plenty of pig-like marks on the ground outside its retreat. If\nI find a few buckets of pig-food, that's a bit more evidence, and the\nnoises and the smell may provide better evidence still. But if the\nanimal then emerges and stands there plainly in view, there is no\nlonger any question of collecting evidence; its coming into view\ndoesn't provide me with more evidence that it's a pig, I can\nnow just see that it is.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014J.L. Austin, Sense and Sensibilia\n\n\n\u2018Not enough evidence God! Not enough evidence!\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Bertrand Russell, upon being asked what he\nwould reply if, after dying, he were brought into the presence of God\nand asked why he had not been a believer\n\n\n If E is evidence for some hypothesis H, then\nE makes it more likely that H is true: in such\ncircumstances, E confirms H. On the other\nhand, if E is evidence against H, then E\nmakes it less likely that H is true: E\ndisconfirms H. Verification is the limiting\ncase of confirmation: a piece of evidence verifies a hypothesis in\nthis sense just in case it conclusively establishes that hypothesis as\ntrue. At the other end of the spectrum, falsification is the\nlimiting case of disconfirmation: a piece of evidence falsifies a\nhypothesis just in case it conclusively establishes that the\nhypothesis is false. It is at least somewhat controversial whether\nfull-fledged verification or falsification in this sense ever\n occurs.[16]\n\n Plausibly, there are some propositions whose truth or falsity we\ngrasp in an utterly direct, unmediated way. Consider, for example,\nsimple arithmetical truths such as the proposition that\n2+2=4. Traditionally, such truths have been held to be\n\u2018self-evident\u2019; allegedly, they need only to be understood\nin order to be known. If the truth value of every proposition were\ntransparent in this way, perhaps we would have little or no need for\nevidence. In contrast, a central function of evidence is to make\nevident that which would not be so in its absence.\n\n In general, we rely on evidence in cases in which our access to truth\nwould otherwise be problematic. One's recognition that the earth\nis roughly spherical in shape seems to depend on one's evidence\nin a way that one's recognition that 2+2=4 does not. Of course, it can\nbe a contested matter whether one's access to truth in some domain is\nproblematic\u2014and thus, whether one is dependent upon evidence for\ngrasping truths about that domain. Common sense holds that we often\nhave unproblematic access to facts about our immediate physical\nenvironment via sense perception; perhaps in part for this\nreason, common sense regards it as at the very least odd, if not\nsimply wrong, to say that one who finds himself face-to-face with what\nis clearly a pig thereby has strong evidence that the animal\nis a pig. (Although it would no doubt also be odd to assert that one\nlacks evidence that the animal is a pig in such\ncircumstances.) In contrast, much traditional epistemology holds that\none's access to such truths is always deeply problematic; what is\nunproblematic, rather, is one's recognition that one's experiences\nrepresent the world as being a certain way. Hence, much traditional\nepistemology construes the relationship between one's experiences and\none's beliefs about the physical world on the model of the\nrelationship between evidence and hypothesis. On this model, the\nfallibility of sense perception is assimilated to the fallibility of\nnon-deductive inference. (The above quotation from Austin is, of\ncourse, a protest against the model in question.)\n\n As a general matter, evidence seems to play a mediating\nrole vis-a-vis our efforts to arrive at an accurate picture of the\nworld: we seek to believe what is true by means of holding beliefs that\nare well-supported by the evidence, and we seek to avoid believing what\nis false by means of not holding beliefs that are not well-supported by\nthe evidence. The picture is well summarized by Blanshard:\n\n \u2018Surely the only possible rule\u2019, one may say, \u2018is\nto believe what is true and disbelieve what is false.\u2019 And of\ncourse that would be the rule if we were in a position to know what\nwas true and what false. But the whole difficulty arises from the fact\nthat we do not and often cannot. What is to guide us then?\u2026 The\nideal is believe no more, but also no less, than what the evidence\nwarrants (1974: 410\u2013411).\n \n\n Indeed, it is plausible to suppose that both the capacity of evidence\nto justify belief (Section 1) and the fact that rational thinkers\nrespect their evidence (Section 2) depends upon the connection between\nevidence and truth.\n\n Why should attending to evidence constitute a\npromising way of pursuing an accurate view of the world? This question\nis more readily answered on some conceptions of evidence than on\nothers. Thus, consider a theory according to which evidence consists of\nfacts. Given that no true proposition is inconsistent with any\nfact, one has an immediate rationale for not believing any proposition\nthat is inconsistent with one's evidence, for only propositions that\nare consistent with one's evidence are even candidates for being true.\nThe same holds for Williamson's conception of evidence as knowledge:\ninasmuch as any known proposition is true, inconsistency with one's\nevidence entails inconsistency with some truth. Put the other way\naround: if evidence consists of facts or known propositions, then no\nbody of evidence rules out any truth. Notice that the same is not true\nfor conceptions of evidence according to which one's evidence consists\nof one's beliefs, or one's experiences, or propositions of which one is\npsychologically certain: that a proposition is inconsistent with one of\nmy beliefs, or with the content of one of my experiences, or with a\nproposition of which I am psychologically certain, does not guarantee\nthat it is false.\n\n Perhaps the root notion of evidence is that of something which serves\nas a reliable sign, symptom, or mark of that which it is evidence\nof. In Ian Hacking's phrase, this is \u2018the evidence of\none thing that points beyond itself\u2019 (1975: 37). Thus, smoke is\nevidence of fire, Koplik spots evidence of measles, a certain\ndistinctive and off-putting smell evidence of rotten egg. Here, the\nparadigm would seem to be that of straightforward correlation: the\nreason why smoke counts as evidence of fire, but not of impending\nrain, is that smoke is a reliable indicator or symptom of the former\nbut not of the latter. Taken at face value, the idea of evidence as\nreliable indicator tends to encourage an inclusive picture of what\nsorts of things are eligible to count as evidence, according to which\neither mental or non-mental objects, events and states of affairs can\nqualify as such. For such entities would seem to be perfectly capable\nof standing in the relevant relation to other objects, events and\nstates of affairs.\n\n Consider the claim that\n\n (1) Koplik spots are evidence of measles.\n\n\n On what is perhaps its most natural reading, the truth of this claim\nwas an empirical discovery of medical science. At a certain point in\ntime, it was discovered that Koplik spots are a reliable indication of\nmeasles\u2014something which was true, presumably, long before\nthe discovery in question. Here, the evidence relation is understood\nas a relation that either obtains or fails to obtain independently of\nwhat anyone knows or believes about its\n obtaining.[17]\n To the extent that one is concerned to arrive at an accurate picture\nof the world, knowledge of instances of this relation\u2014roughly,\nknowledge of what bits of the world tend to accompany what other bits\nof the world\u2014would seem to be exactly the sort of thing which\none is seeking.  When the evidence relation is construed in this way,\ninvestigating it is of a piece with investigating the world\nitself.\n\n Similarly \n\n (2) Smoke is evidence of fire\n\n \n would seem to have the same empirical status as (1), differing\nchiefly in that it is much more widely known. \n\n When evidence is understood in this way, it is no mystery why\nattending to evidence is a good strategy for one who is concerned to\narrive at an accurate picture of the world: given that Koplik spots\nare in fact a reliable indicator of measles, it obviously behooves\nthose who are concerned to have true beliefs about which individuals\nare suffering from measles to pay attention to facts about which\nindividuals have Koplik spots. Similarly, given that smoke is in fact\na reliable indicator of fire, those who are concerned to have true\nbeliefs about the presence or absence of fire do well to pay attention\nto the presence or absence of smoke. Thus, when we understand\n\u2018E is evidence for H\u2019 as more or less\nsynonymous with \u2018E is a reliable indicator of\nH\u2019, the connection between evidence and truth seems\neasily secured and relatively straightforward. \n\n Of course, although the presence of Koplik spots is in fact a\nreliable guide to the presence of measles, one who is ignorant of this\nfact is not in a position to conclude that a given patient has\nmeasles, even if he or she is aware that the patient has Koplik\nspots. Someone who knows that Koplik spots are evidence of measles is\nin a position to diagnose patients in a way that someone who is\nignorant of that fact is not. In general, the extent to which one is\nin a position to gain new information on the basis of particular\npieces of evidence typically depends upon one's background\nknowledge. This fact is a commonplace among philosophers of science\nand has also been emphasized by philosophically-sophisticated\n historians.[18]\n\n Suppose that one knows that a particular patient has Koplik spots but\nis ignorant of the connection between Koplik spots and\nmeasles. Moreover, suppose that one's ignorance is not itself the\nresult of any prior irrationality or unreasonableness on one's part:\nrather, one has simply never had the opportunity to learn about the\nconnection between Koplik spots and measles. In these circumstances,\ndoes one have evidence that the patient has measles? Taken in one\nsense, this question should be answered affirmatively: one does have\nevidence that the patient has measles, although one is not in a\nposition to recognize that one does.  However, the idea that one has\nevidence in such circumstances seems to sit somewhat awkwardly with\nthe themes that evidence tends to justify belief, and that rational\nthinkers are sensitive to their evidence. For consider the moment when\none first learns that the patient has Koplik spots. Given one's\nignorance of the connection between Koplik spots and measles, one is\nnot in any way unreasonable if one fails to become more confident that\nthe patient has measles. Indeed, given one's ignorance, it seems that\none would be unreasonable if one did become more confident\nthat the patient has measles upon learning that she has Koplik spots,\nand that a belief that the patient has measles held on this basis\nwould be unjustified.\n\n This suggests that the notion of evidence in play in statements such\nas \u2018evidence tends to justify belief\u2019 and \u2018rational\nthinkers respect their evidence\u2019 cannot simply be identified\nwith evidence in the sense of reliable indicator.  Let's call evidence\nin the former sense normative evidence, and evidence in the\nlatter sense indicator evidence.  Although the normative\nnotion of evidence cannot simply be identified with the indicator\nnotion, we would expect the two to be closely linked, inasmuch as\none's possession of normative evidence frequently depends upon one's\nawareness that one thing is indicator evidence of something else.\n\n Reflection on the role that considerations of background theory play\nin determining how it is reasonable for one to respond to new\ninformation have convinced some that the normative notion of evidence\nis better understood in terms of a three place-relation rather than a\ntwo-place relation. According to this view, judgements of the form\n\u2018E is evidence for H\u2019\u2014when this is\nunderstood as more or less synonymous with \u2018E tends to\nmake it more reasonable to believe H\u2019\u2014 are\ntypically elliptical for judgements of the form \u2018E is\nevidence for H relative to background theory\nT\u2019. Thus, given that your background theory includes\nthe claim that Koplik spots are a reliable indication of measles, the\nfact that a particular patient has Koplik spots constitutes normative\nevidence for you (gives you a reason to believe that) the patient has\nmeasles. On the other hand, given that my background theory does\nnot include the claim that Koplik spots are a reliable\nindication of measles, the fact that the same patient has Koplik spots\ndoes not constitute normative evidence for me (give me a\nreason to believe that) the patient has measles.\n\n The view that the status of E as normative evidence for\nH can depend upon considerations of background theory\nimmediately raises questions about the status of the background theory\nitself. Given that one's background theory consists of some set of\npropositions, which set is it? Is it the set of propositions that one\nknows? Or rather, the set of propositions that one believes? Or\nperhaps, the set of propositions that one justifiably\nbelieves? It seems that E might count as evidence for\nH relative to the set of propositions that one believes but\nnot relative to the set of propositions that one knows (or vice\nversa)\u2014which of these, if either, determines whether E\nis evidence for H, in the sense that one's possession of\nE tends to justify one in believing that H is true?\nThe issues that arise here are subtle and delicate; Christensen (1997)\nis a careful and illuminating discussion.\n\nA note about confirmation theory.  Although philosophy had\nin some sense long been concerned with questions about when evidence\nmakes a theory more likely to be true, the investigation of this\nrelationship reached new levels of systematicity and rigor during the\npositivist era. The positivists thought of philosophy as \u2018the\nlogic of science\u2019; they thus took it to be a central task of\nphilosophy to furnish detailed analyses and explications of\nfundamental scientific concepts such as explanation and\nconfirmation.\n\n Hempel (1945) and Carnap (1950) each distinguished two different\n\u2018concepts\u2019 of confirmation: the\n\u2018classificatory\u2019 or \u2018qualitative\u2019 concept on\nthe one hand and the \u2018quantitative\u2019 concept on the\nother. Roughly, the classificatory concept is employed in the making\nof yes-or-no judgements about whether a given piece of evidence does\nor does not support a given hypothesis.  Thus, it is the\nclassificatory concept which is in play when one is concerned with\njudgements of the following form: \u2018Hypothesis H is\nconfirmed by evidence E\u2019. On the other hand, the\nquantitative concept is employed in making numerical judgements about\nhow much support a hypothesis derives from a given piece of\nevidence (e.g,. \u2018Hypothesis H is confirmed by evidence\nE to degree\n R\u2019).[19]\n Formal theories attempting to explicate each of these notions were\ndeveloped. Hempel (1945) took the lead in attempting to explicate the\nqualitative concept while Carnap (1950, 1952) concentrated on the\nquantitative concept. During this period, the philosophical study of\nthe relationship between evidence and theory took on, perhaps for the\nfirst time, the characteristics of something like normal science, and\nbecame a discipline replete with technical problems, puzzles, and\nparadoxes, the anticipated solutions to which were viewed as items on\nthe agenda for future\n research.[20]\n Here lie the origins of present-day confirmation theory, as\nrepresented by Bayesianism in its protean forms (See, e.g., Jeffrey\n1965, 1992, 2004, Horwich 1983, Howson and Urbach 1993) and its rivals\n(e.g., Glymour's (1980) \u2018bootstrapping\u2019 model of\nconfirmation).\n\n Although Carnap's own vision for confirmation theory was ultimately\n abandoned,[21]\n the quantitative approach that he championed proved influential to\nthe subsequent development of the subject. In particular, the emphasis\non attempting to understand confirmation in quantitative terms paved\nthe way for the increased use of mathematics\u2014and\nspecifically, the probability calculus\u2014in the philosophical\nstudy of evidence. The idea that the probability calculus provides the\nkey to understanding the relation of confirmation is central to\nBayesianism, the dominant view within contemporary confirmation\ntheory. An examination of Bayesianism will not be undertaken\n here.[22]\n Instead, we will simply take note of the explication of the concept\nof evidence which the Bayesian offers. At the outset of the present\nsection, we noted that evidence confirms a theory just in case that\nevidence makes the theory more likely to be true; evidence disconfirms\na theory just in case the evidence renders the theory less likely to\nbe true. The Bayesian takes these platitudes at face value and offers\nthe following probabilistic explication of what it is for E\nto be evidence for H: \n\nE is evidence for H if and only if\nProb(H/E) > \n Prob(H).[23 ]\n\n\n That is, E is evidence for H just in case the\nconditional probability of H on E is greater than\nthe unconditional probability of H. Thus, the fact that\nthe suspect's blood is on the knife is evidence for the\nhypothesis that the suspect committed the murder if and only\nif the probability that the suspect committed the murder is greater\ngiven that his blood is on the knife than it would be otherwise.\n\n Similarly \n\nE is evidence against H if and only if\nProb(H/E) < Prob(H).\n \n\n That is, E is evidence against H just in case the\nconditional probability of H on E is less than the\nunconditional probability of H. Thus, the fact that the\nsuspect's fingerprints are not on the knife is evidence against\nthe hypothesis that the suspect committed the murder if and\nonly if the probability that the suspect committed the murder is lower\ngiven the absence of his fingerprints on the knife than it would be\notherwise. Within this probabilistic model, verification (in the sense\nof conclusive confirmation) would involve bestowing probability 1 on\nan hypothesis while falsification would involve bestowing probability\n0 on it.\n\n This straightforward probabilistic model of evidence and confirmation\nis an attractive and natural one. Indeed, hints of it are found in\nAnglo-American\n law.[24]\n The model is not without its critics, however. Achinstein (1983)\ncontends that something can increase the probability of a claim\nwithout providing evidence for that claim. For example, the\ninformation that seven-time Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz went\nswimming increases the probability that Mark Spitz has just drowned;\nnevertheless, according to Achinstein, the former hardly constitutes\nevidence that the latter is\n true.[25]\n According to a line of thought in Goodman (1955), the notion of\nconfirmation that is crucial for science is not to be understood in\nterms of straightforward increase-in-probability. Thus, consider the\ngeneralization that All of the change in my pocket consists of\nnickels.  Examining one of the coins in my pocket and finding\nthat it is a nickel undoubtedly increases the probability that the\ngeneralization is true, inasmuch as it now has one less potential\nfalsifier. But Goodman contends the relevant observation does not\nconfirm the generalization, inasmuch as the observation should not\nmake one more confident that any of the other, as-yet-unexamined coins\nin my pocket is itself a nickel.  (According to Goodman, although\n\u2018accidental generalizations\u2019 such as \u2018All the coins\nin my pockets are nickels\u2019 can have their probabilities raised\nby observations, they cannot be confirmed by them, in the way that\n\u2018law-like generalizations\u2019 can be.)\n\n In general, the idea\nthat the probability calculus provides the key to understanding the\nconcept of evidence has found greater favor among philosophers of\nscience than among traditional epistemologists. In the next and final\nsection, we turn to a cluster of themes that have also been much\nemphasized by philosophers of science, themes which came to the fore as\na result of philosophical reflection upon the role that evidence plays\nwithin scientific practice itself.\n4. Objectivity, Publicity, and Intersubjectivity: Evidence as Neutral Arbiter\n\nWhat is creditable \u2026 is not the mere belief in this or that,\nbut the having arrived at it by a process which, had the evidence been\ndifferent, would have carried one with equal readiness to a contrary\nbelief.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Blanshard, Reason and Belief\n\n\n It is natural to suppose that the concept of evidence is intimately\nrelated to the cognitive desideratum of objectivity.\nAccording to this line of thought, individuals and institutions are\nobjective to the extent that they allow their views about what is the\ncase or what ought to be done to be guided by the evidence, as opposed\nto (say) the typically distorting influences of ideological dogma,\nprejudice in favor of one's kin, or texts whose claim to authority is\nexhausted by their being venerated by tradition. To the extent that\nindividuals and institutions are objective in this sense, we should\nexpect their views to increasingly converge over time: as shared\nevidence accumulates, consensus tends to emerge with respect to\nformerly disputed questions. Objective inquiry is evidence-driven\ninquiry, which makes for intersubjective agreement among\n inquirers.[26]\n Thus, it is widely thought that the reason why the natural sciences\nexhibit a degree of consensus that is conspicuously absent from many\nothers fields is that the former are evidence-driven\u2014and therefore,\nobjective\u2014in ways that the latter are not. \n\n According to this picture, a central function of evidence is to serve\nas a neutral arbiter among rival theories and their\nadherents. Whatever disagreements might exist at the level of theory,\nif those who disagree are objective, then the persistence of their\ndisagreement is an inherently fragile matter, for it is always hostage\nto the emergence of evidence which decisively resolves the dispute in\none direction or the other. Our ability to arrive at consensus in such\ncircumstances is thus constrained only by our resourcefulness and\ningenuity in generating such evidence (e.g., by designing and\nexecuting crucial experiments) and by the generosity of the world in\noffering it up.\n\n The slogan \u2018the priority of evidence to theory\u2019 has\nsometimes been employed in an attempt to capture this general\ntheme. However, this slogan has itself been used in a number of\nimportantly different ways that it is worth pausing to\ndistinguish. \n\n First, the claim that \u2018evidence is prior to theory\u2019 might\nsuggest a simple model of scientific method that is often associated\n(whether fairly or unfairly) with Francis Bacon. According to the\nmodel in question, the collection of evidence is temporally\nprior to the formulation of any theory or theories of the\nrelevant domain. That is, the first stage in any properly-conducted\nscientific inquiry consists in gathering and classifying a large\namount of data; crucially, this process is in no way guided or aided\nby considerations of theory. Only after a large amount of data has\nbeen gathered and classified does the scientist first attempt to\nformulate some theory or theories of the domain in question. On this\nmodel, then, evidence is prior to theory within the context of\ndiscovery. This model\u2014which Hempel (1966) dubbed \u2018the\nnarrow inductivist account of scientific inquiry\u2019\u2014is now\nuniversally rejected by philosophers. For it is now appreciated that,\nat any given time, which theories are accepted\u2014or more weakly,\nwhich theories are taken to be plausible hypotheses\u2014typically\nplays a crucial role in guiding the subsequent search for evidence\nwhich bears on those theories. Thus, a crucial experiment might be\nperformed to decide between two rival theories T1\nand T2; once performed, the outcome of that\nexperiment constitutes an expansion in the total evidence which is\nsubsequently available to the relevant scientific community. If,\nhowever, the two leading contenders had been theories\nT1 and T3, a different crucial\nexperiment would have been performed, which would have (typically)\nresulted in a different expansion in the total evidence. The point\nthat the formulation of hypotheses is often temporally prior to the\ncollection of evidence which bears on their truth (and that this\npriority is no accident) is perhaps most immediately apparent on\nPopper's falsificationist model of science (1959), according to which\nexemplary scientific practice consists in repeatedly attempting to\nfalsify whichever theory is presently most favored by the relevant\nscientific community. But it is no less true on other, less radical\nmodels of science, which (unlike Popper's) allow a role for confirming\nevidence as well as disconfirming evidence. As Hempel puts the\npoint,\n\n In sum, the maxim that data should be gathered without guidance by\nantecedent hypotheses about the connections among the facts under\nstudy is self-defeating, and it is certainly not followed in\nscientific inquiry.  On the contrary, tentative hypotheses are needed\nto give direction to a scientific investigation. Such hypotheses\ndetermine, among other things, what data should be collected at a\ngiven point in a scientific investigation (1966,\n p. 13).[27]\n\n\n A second, quite different, sense of \u2018priority\u2019 in which\nevidence has sometimes been held to be prior to theory is that of\nsemantic priority. According to this view, the meanings of\nhypotheses that involve \u2018theoretical terms\u2019 (e.g.,\n\u2018electron\u2019) depend upon the connections between such\nhypotheses and that which would count as evidence for their\ntruth\u2014typically on such accounts, the observations that would\nconfirm them. The view that (observational) evidence is semantically\nprior to theories was central to the logical positivist conception of\nscience. On this picture, meaning flows upward from the level of\nobservation; a given theory is imbued with whatever meaning it has in\nvirtue of standing in certain relations to the observational level,\nwhich constitutes the original locus of meaning. The picture was\ngradually abandoned, however, in the face of repeated failures to\ncarry through the kind of theoretical reductions that the picture\nseemed to demand, as well as appreciation of the point, forcefully\nemphasized by\n Putnam[28]\n and others, that the meanings of\ntheoretical terms do not seem to change as our views about what counts\nas confirming evidence for hypotheses in which they occur evolve.\n\n A third and final sense of \u2018priority\u2019 in which evidence\nhas often been thought to be prior to theory is that of\nepistemic priority. On this view, it is not that the task of\nevidence gathering either is or ought to be performed earlier in time\nthan the task of formulating theories; nor is semantic priority at\nissue. Rather, the thought is that theories depend for their\njustification on standing in certain relations to evidence (understood\nhere, once again, as that which is observed), but that observations do\nnot themselves depend upon theories for their own justification. That\nis: (observational) evidence is prior to theory within the context\nof justification. This, perhaps, is the interpretation of\n\u2018evidence is prior to theory\u2019 on which the slogan enjoys\nits greatest plausibility. For it seems that our justification for\nbelieving any presently-accepted theory of natural or social science\ntypically does depend upon suitable observations having been made, but\nthat, on the other hand, one can be justified in taking oneself to\nhave observed that such-and-such is the case even if there is\nat present no available theory as to why such-and-such is the\ncase (and indeed, even if such-and-such's being the case is unexpected\nor unlikely given the theories that one presently accepts). To the\nextent that such a justificational asymmetry exists, there would seem\nto be some truth to the idea that evidence is epistemically prior to\n theory.[29]\n And this sort of priority might seem to be exactly what is required\nif evidence is to play the role of neutral arbiter among those who\ncome to the table with different theoretical commitments.\n\n The idea of evidence as a kind of ultimate court of appeal, uniquely\nqualified to generate agreement among those who hold rival theories,\nis a highly plausible one. Nevertheless, complications with this\nsimple picture\u2014some more serious than\nothers\u2014abound. Above, we took note of the widely-held view\naccording to which the bearing of a given piece of evidence on a given\nhypothesis depends on considerations of background theory. Thus, two\nindividuals who hold different background theories might disagree\nabout how strongly a particular piece of evidence confirms a given\ntheory, or indeed, about whether the evidence confirms the theory at\nall. Of course, if the question of who has the superior background\ntheory is itself susceptible to rational adjudication, then this\npossibility need pose no deep threat to objectivity. Often enough,\nthis will be the case. Suppose, for example, that you treat the fact\nthat \n\n(i) the patient has Koplik spots on her skin\n \nas evidence that\n\n (ii) the patient has measles\n \n\n while I do not, simply because you know that Koplik spots are\ntypically an effect of measles while I am ignorant of this fact. Here,\nthat you treat (i) as evidence for (ii) while I do not is attributable\nto the straightforward superiority of your background theory to mine:\nyou possess a crucial piece of medical knowledge that I\nlack. Presumably, if I were to acquire the relevant bit of medical\nknowledge, then I too would treat (i) as confirming evidence for\n(ii). The possibility that those who are relatively ill-informed might\ndiffer from those who are better informed in the way that they respond\nto evidence does not itself cast doubt on the capacity of evidence to\nplay the role of neutral arbiter among theories; clearly, what is\nneeded in such cases is for the worse informed party to become privy\nto those facts of which they are presently ignorant. \n\n However, a recurrent motif in twentieth century philosophy of science\nis that the bearing of evidence on theory is mediated by factors that\nmight vary between individuals in ways that do not admit of such\nrational adjudication. Imagine two eminent scientists, both of whom\nare thoroughly acquainted with all of the available evidence\nwhich bears on some theory. One believes the theory, the other\nbelieves some different, incompatible theory instead.  Must one of the\ntwo scientists be making a mistake about what their shared evidence\nsupports? Perhaps the most natural answer to this question, at least\nat first blush, is \u2018Yes\u2019. A fair amount of twentieth\ncentury philosophy of science shied away from this natural answer,\nhowever, at least in part because of a growing awareness of just how\noften eminent, fully-informed and seemingly rational\nscientists have disagreed in the history of\n science.[30]\n Thus, Thomas Kuhn (1962) would maintain that both scientists might be\nperfectly rational in holding incompatible theories, inasmuch as\nrationality is relative to a paradigm, and the two scientists might be\noperating within different paradigms. Similarly, Carnap (1952) would\nmaintain that both scientists might be rational because rationality is\nrelative to an inductive method or confirmation function, and the two\nscientists might be employing different inductive methods or\nconfirmation functions. As we have noted, for the contemporary\nBayesian, how it is reasonable to respond to a given body of evidence\ndepends upon one's prior probability distribution: the two scientists\nmight thus both be rational in virtue of possessing different prior\nprobability distributions. There are, of course, important differences\namong these accounts of rationality. But notice that they each possess\nthe same structure: what it is reasonable for one to believe depends\nnot only on one's total evidence but also on some further feature\nF (one's prior probability distribution, paradigm, inductive\nmethod.).  Because this further feature F can vary between\ndifferent individuals, even quite different responses to a given body\nof evidence might be equally reasonable. On such views, the bearing of\na given body of evidence on a given theory becomes a highly\nrelativized matter. For this reason, the capacity of evidence to\ngenerate agreement among even impeccably rational individuals is in\nprinciple subject to significant limitations. \n\n Why is relativity to a prior probability\ndistribution (paradigm, inductive method) any more threatening to the\nidea of evidence as neutral arbiter than the previously mentioned\nrelativity to background theory? The difference is this: when I fail to\ntreat Koplik spots as evidence of measles, there is a clear and\nstraightforward sense in which my background theory is inferior to\nyours. By contrast, proponents of the views presently under\nconsideration typically insist that a relatively wide range of prior\nprobability distributions (confirmation functions, inductive methods,\nparadigms) might be equally good. For this reason, such views\nare often criticized on the grounds that they turn the relationship\nbetween evidence and theory into an overly subjective affair.\n\n Proponents of such views are not wholly without resources for\nattempting to alleviate this concern. In particular, many subjective\nBayesians place great weight on a phenomenon known as the\n\u2018swamping\u2019 or \u2018washing out\u2019 of the\npriors. Here, the idea is that even individuals who begin with quite\ndifferent prior probabilities will tend to converge in their views\ngiven subsequent exposure to a sufficiently extensive body of common\nevidence. However, the significance of the relevant convergence\nresults is highly\n controversial.[31] \n\n According to the accounts briefly canvassed here, two individuals of\nimpeccable rationality might radically disagree about the bearing of a\nparticular piece of evidence E on a given hypothesis\nH. Even in such cases, the disputants are not wholly without\ncommon ground. For they at least agree about the characterization of\nthe evidence E: their disagreement concerns rather the\nprobative force of E with respect to H. An even more\nradical challenge to the capacity of evidence to serve as neutral\narbiter among rival theories concerns the alleged theory-ladenness\nof observation.  According to proponents of the doctrine of\ntheory-ladenness, in cases of fundamental theoretical dispute, there\nwill typically be no theoretically-neutral characterization of the\nevidence available.  Rather, adherents of rival theories will\nirremediably differ as to the appropriate description of the\n data itself.[32] \n\n The doctrine of theory-ladenness is perhaps best appreciated when it\nis viewed against the background of the positivist tradition to which\nit was in large part a reaction. For the positivists, evidence was\nboth epistemically and semantically prior to theory. Moreover, central\nto the positivist conception of science as a paradigm of rationality\nand objectivity is the idea that its disputes admitted of rational\nadjudication by appeal to evidence that could be appreciated by both\nsides. For these reasons, the positivists often insisted that the\nfundamental units of evidential significance\u2014observation\nstatements or \u2018protocol sentences\u2019\u2014should employ\nonly vocabulary that is within the idiolect of any minimally competent\nspeaker of the relevant language.  Ideally then, observation\nstatements should be comprehensible to and verifiable by individuals\nwho possess no specialized knowledge or terminological\nsophistication. Thus, Carnap recommended \u2018blue\u2019 and\n\u2018hard\u2019 as exemplary predicates for observation\n sentences.[33]\n As against this, Hanson insisted that\n\n \u2026 the layman simply cannot see what the physicist sees\n\u2026 when the physicist looks at an X-ray tube, he sees the\ninstrument in terms of electrical circuit theory, thermodynamic\ntheory, the theories of metal and glass structure, thermionic\nemission, optical transmission, refraction, diffraction, atomic\ntheory, quantum theory and special relativity (1961:19).\n \n\n But what holds for the physicist and the layman holds also for two\nphysicists with sufficiently different theoretical\ncommitments. Thus\n\n To say that Tycho and Kepler, Simplicius and Galileo, Hooke and\nNewton, Priestly and Lavoisier, Soddy and Einstein, De Broglie and\nBorn, Heisenberg and Bohm all make the same observations but use them\ndifferently is too easy. This parallels the too-easy epistemological\ndoctrine that all normal observers see the same things in x, but\ninterpret them differently. It does not explain controversy in\nresearch science (1961:13).\n \n\n The extent to which observation is theory-laden remains a contested\n matter.[34]\n To the extent that evidence which bears on a theory does not admit of\na neutral characterization among those with sufficiently different\ntheoretical commitments, this threatens to limit the ability of such\nevidence to successfully discharge the role of neutral arbiter in such\ncases. Still, whatever concessions to the proponents of\ntheory-ladenness might be in order, the significance of the doctrine\nthat they defend should not be overstated. For in any case, it seems\nundeniable that theories sometimes are discredited by the emergence of\nevidence which is taken to undermine them\u2014even in the eyes\nof their former\n proponents.[35]\n Let's assume then that evidence sometimes does successfully discharge\nthe function of neutral arbiter among theories and is that which\nsecures intersubjective agreement among inquirers. What must evidence\nbe like, in order for it to play this role? That is, given that\nevidence sometimes underwrites intersubjective agreement, what\nconstraints does this place on answers to the question: what sorts of\nthings are eligible to count as evidence?\n\n Above, we noted that the traditional epistemological demand that\none's evidence consist of that to which one has immediate and\nunproblematic access\u2014and indeed, that one's evidence must be\nsuch that one can appreciate it (at least it in principle) even when\none is in the most dire of epistemic predicaments\u2014has often\nencouraged a phenomenal conception of evidence, according to which\none's evidence is limited to one's experiences or sense data. On this\npicture, evidence consists of essentially private mental states,\naccessible only to the relevant subject. This picture of evidence\nstands in no small measure of tension with the idea that a central\nfunction of evidence is to serve as a neutral arbiter among competing\nviews. For it is natural to think that the ability of evidence to play\nthis latter role depends crucially on its having an\nessentially public character, i.e., that it is the sort of\nthing which can be grasped and appreciated by multiple\nindividuals. Here, the most natural contenders would seem to be\nphysical objects and the states of affairs and events in which they\nparticipate, since it is such entities that are characteristically\naccessible to multiple observers. (I ask what evidence there is for\nyour diagnosis that the patient suffers from measles; in response, you\nmight simply point to or demonstrate the lesions on\nher skin.) On the other hand, to the extent that one's evidence\nconsists of essentially private states there would seem to be no\npossibility of sharing one's evidence with others. But it is precisely\nthe possibility of sharing relevant evidence which is naturally\nthought to secure the objectivity of science. Indeed, it has often\nbeen held that inasmuch as the objectivity of science is underwritten\nby the fact that science is evidence driven, it is the public\ncharacter of scientific evidence which is crucial. On this view, it is\na central methodological norm of science to eschew as inadmissible\n(e.g.) any alleged episodes of incommunicable insight in considering\nwhether to accept or reject a claim. The theme of the essentially\npublic character of scientific evidence has been prominent from the\nearliest days of modern science\u2014it was championed, for example,\nby Robert Boyle, founder of the Royal Society, who insisted that the\n\u2018witnessing\u2019 of experiments was to be a collective\n act[36]\u2014and\n has remained so up until the present day. Unsurprisingly, the theme\nwas taken up by philosophers of science with gusto. Thus, Hempel\nrequired that \u2018all statements of empirical science be capable of\ntest by reference to evidence which is public, i.e., evidence which\ncan be secured by different observers and does not depend essentially\non the observer\u2019 (1952: 22). The idea was echoed by other\nleading positivists (see, e.g., Feigl 1953) as well as by Popper\n(1959). More recently, in the course of reviewing \u2018some of the\nthings objectivity, and specifically scientific objectivity, has been\nthought to involve\u2019, Peter Railton singles out the idea that\n\n\n \u2026 objective inquiry uses procedures that are intersubjective\nand independent of particular individuals and circumstances\u2014for\nexample \u2026 it makes no essential use of introspective or\nsubjectively privileged evidence in theory assessment (1985: 764).\n \n\n In short, it is not simply that the conception of evidence gleaned\nfrom exemplary scientific practice differs from the conception of\nevidence that traditional epistemology seemed to demand (as would be\nthe case if, for example, one was somewhat more inclusive than the\nother). Rather, what seemed to be one of the characteristic features\nof scientific evidence, viz. its potential publicity, is the exact\ncontrary of one of the characteristic features of evidence as\nconstrued by much traditional epistemology, viz. its privacy. Such a\ntension was bound to generate a certain amount of dissonance. One\nhistorically noteworthy manifestation of this dissonance was the\nprotracted debate within the positivist tradition over the nature of\n\u2018protocol sentences\u2019. Here, Carnap's odyssey is perhaps\nthe most illuminating. Early in his philosophical career, Carnap,\nunder the influence of Russell and Ernst Mach (and through them, the\ntradition of classical empiricism) took sense data as the ultimate\nevidence for all of our empirical knowledge.  (Indeed, his early work\nDer Logischer Aufbau der Welt (1928) is largely devoted to\nthe Russellian project of \u2018constructing\u2019 the external\nworld out of sense data.) During this period, Carnap maintained that\nthe protocol sentences that serve as the \u2018confirmation\nbasis\u2019 for scientific theories refer to sense data or (to be\nmore precise) \u2018the sensing of sense data\u2019. However, under\nthe influence of both Popper and Otto Neurath, Carnap ultimately\nabandoned this view of protocol sentences in favor of one on which\nsuch sentences refer not to private mental events but rather to public\nobjects and states of affairs. As recounted in his philosophical\nautobiography, the primary motivation for this change of heart was the\ngrowing conviction that the conception of evidence as private mental\nstates rendered it inadequate to ground the intersubjectivity and\nobjectivity of\n science.[37]\n In this area as in others, the evolution of Carnap's own views was\ncrucial to the evolution of the views of the Vienna Circle as a whole.\nThe episode was well-recounted years later by Ayer: \n\n At the outset \u2026 the prevailing view was that these\n[observation] statements referred to the subject's introspectible or\nsensory experiences \u2026 [I]t was held, following Russell and\nultimately Berkeley, that perceiving physical objects was to be\nanalyzed in terms of having sensations, or as Russell put it, of\nsensing sense data. Though physical objects might be publicly\naccessible, sense data were taken to be private. There could be no\nquestion of our literally sharing one another's sense data, any more\nthan we can literally share one another's thoughts or images or\nfeelings \u2026 [T]his conception of elementary statements was exposed\nto attack on various grounds.\u2026 [T]he most serious difficulty lay\nin the privacy of the objects to which the elementary statements were\nsupposed to refer.\u2026 Because of such difficulties, Neurath, and\nsubsequently Carnap, rejected the whole conception of elementary\nstatements. They argued that if elementary statements were to serve as\nthe basis for the intersubjective statements of science, they must\nthemselves be intersubjective. They must refer, not to private\nincommunicable experiences, but to public physical events (1959:\n17\u201320).\n \n\n Inasmuch as it is the distinctive function of protocol sentences to\nreport one's evidence, a view about what sorts of contents a protocol\nsentence might have is in effect a view about what sorts of things can\ncount as evidence. To abandon a view according to which the subject\nmatter of any protocol sentence concerns the \u2018private\nincommunicable experiences\u2019 of some particular individual is in\neffect to abandon a version of the phenomenal conception of\nevidence. To adopt in its place a view according to which the subject\nmatter of any protocol sentence concerns \u2018public physical\nevents\u2019 is thus a particularly radical shift, inasmuch as this\nlatter view seems to entail that only public physical events\ncan count as evidence\u2014and in particular, that experiences,\nformerly taken to exhaust the category of evidence, are ineligible to\ncount as\n such.[38] \n\n Underneath the positivists' changing views about the nature of\nprotocol sentences, however, lay a fundamental assumption that they\nnever questioned. The assumption in question is the following: that\nthere is some general restriction on the subject matter of a sentence\nif that sentence is a potential statement of one's evidence. This\nassumption was explicitly rejected by Austin: \n\n It is not the case that the formulation of evidence is the function\nof any special sort of sentence.\u2026 In general, any kind\nof statement could state evidence for any other kind, if the\ncircumstances were appropriate.\u2026 (1962: 116; emphases his).\n \n\n According to the alternative picture sketched by Austin, there are,\nindeed, circumstances in which one's having knowledge that things\nare a certain way depends upon one's having\n\u2018phenomenal\u2019 evidence provided by the fact that is how\nthings look, seem, or appear.  Traditional\nepistemology errs, however, in thinking that this is the general\ncase. Indeed, there are circumstances in which the fact that things\nare a certain way constitutes one's evidence for judgements about how\nthey look, seem or\n appear.[39] \n\n Inasmuch as he denies that there are any general restrictions on the\nsubject matter of an evidence statement, Austin's way of thinking\nabout evidence is considerably more liberal or inclusive than that of\nmuch of the tradition. In this respect, his account of evidence\nresembles Williamson's (2000) later theory. As we have seen,\nWilliamson holds that one's evidence consists of everything that one\nknows. In particular, one's evidence is not limited to one's knowledge\nof one's experiences, nor is it limited to one's observational\nknowledge\u2014one's evidence also includes any theoretical\nknowledge that one might possess (p. 190). \n\n On such liberalized views, although one's evidence is not limited to\none's introspectively arrived at knowledge of one's experiences, it\nincludes everything that one knows about one's experiences on\nthe basis of introspection. In this respect, such views are\nincompatible not only with the phenomenal conception of evidence but\nalso with views that would rule out the objects of introspection as\nevidence on the grounds that the objects of introspection lack the\nobjectivity and publicity that is characteristic of genuine\nevidence. However, it is dubious that any view on which evidence plays\na role in justifying belief can consistently observe a constraint\nwhich would preclude the objects of introspection from counting as\ngenuine evidence. Goldman (1997) argues that any such constraint is\ninconsistent with the introspectionist methodology employed in various\nareas of contemporary cognitive science and that this undercuts\n\u2018the traditional view \u2026 that scientific evidence can be\nproduced only by intersubjective methods that can be used by different\ninvestigators and will produce agreement\u2019 (p. 95).\n\n Reflection on examples drawn from more homely contexts also casts\ndoubt on the idea that all genuine evidence is in principle accessible\nto multiple individuals. When one has a headache, one is typically\njustified in believing that one has a headache. While others might\nhave evidence that one has a headache\u2014evidence afforded,\nperhaps, by one's testimony, or by one's non-linguistic\nbehavior\u2014it is implausible that whatever evidence others\npossess is identical with that which justifies one's own belief that\none has a headache. Indeed, it seems dubious that others could have\none's evidence, given that others cannot literally share one's\nheadache. \n\n Here then we see another context in which theoretical demands are\nplaced on the concept of evidence that seem to pull in different\ndirections. On the one hand, it is thought central to the concept of\nevidence that evidence is by its very nature the kind of thing that\ncan generate rational convergence of opinion in virtue of being shared\nby multiple individuals. This encourages the idea that any genuine\npiece of evidence can in principle be grasped by multiple individuals;\nanything which cannot be so grasped is either not genuine evidence or\nis at best a degenerate species thereof. On the other hand, evidence\nis taken to be that which justifies belief. And it seems that many of\nthe beliefs which individuals hold about their own mental lives on the\nbasis of introspection are justified by factors with respect to which\nthey enjoy privileged access. Notably, the positivists' embrace of the\nidea that protocol sentences refer exclusively to publicly-observable\nphysical objects and events was accompanied by an embrace of\nbehaviorism in\n psychology.[40]\n It is characteristic of behaviorism to denigrate the idea that the\ndeliverances of introspection can constitute genuine evidence; on this\ncombination of views then, the thesis that all evidence consists of\nthat which can be shared by multiple observers is upheld. For those who\nreject behaviorism, however, the idea that at least some evidence does\nnot meet this condition is a more difficult one to resist.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Achinstein, Peter, 1983. \u2018Concepts of Evidence,\u2019 in\nAchinstein (ed.) <em>The Concept of Evidence</em>, Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press: 145\u2013174.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1992. \u2018The Evidence Against\nKronz,\u2019 <em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 67: 169\u2013175.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2001. <em>The Book of Evidence</em>, Oxford:\nOxford University Press.", "Austin, J.L., 1962. <em>Sense and Sensibilia</em>, Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press.", "Ayer, A.J., 1936. <em>Language, Truth, and Logic</em>, New York:\nDover.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1946. <em>Language, Truth, and Logic</em>, Second\nedition.
