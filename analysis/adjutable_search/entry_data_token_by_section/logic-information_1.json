    "main_text": "Information as Range || Epistemic logic\n1.1 Epistemic logic\n\nIn this section we will explore how it is that the elimination of\npossibilities corresponding to information-gain is the starting point\nfor research on logics of knowledge and belief that fall under the\nheading of epistemic logics. We will begin with classic\nsingle-agent epistemic logic, before exploring multi-agent epistemic\nlogics. In both cases, since we will be concentrating on logics of\nknowledge as opposed to logics of belief, the information-gained will\nbe hard information.\n\nConsider the waiter example in more detail. Before receiving the hard\ninformation that the soda is for you (and for the sake of the example\nwe are assuming that the waiting is dealing with hard information\nhere), the waiter\u2019s knowledge-base is modelled by a pair of\nworlds (hereafter information states) \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such\nthat in \\(x\\) you ordered the soda and your friend the espresso, and\nin \\(y\\) you ordered the espresso and your friend the soda. After\nreceiving the hard information that the soda is for you, \\(y\\) is\neliminated from the waiter\u2019s knowledge-base, leaving only \\(x\\).\nAs such, the reduction of the range of possibilities corresponds to an\ninformation-gain for the waiter. Consider the truth condition for\nagent \\(\\alpha\\) knows that \\(\\phi\\), written\n\\(K_{\\alpha}\\phi\\): \n\\[\\tag{1} x \\Vdash K_{\\alpha}\\phi \\text{ iff\nfor all } y \\text{ s.t. (such that) } R_{\\alpha}xy, y \\Vdash \\phi \\]\n\n\nThe accessibility relation \\(R_{\\alpha}\\) is an equivalence relation\nconnecting \\(x\\) to all information states \\(y\\) such that \\(y\\) is\nindistinguishable from \\(x\\), given \\(\\alpha\\)\u2019s\nhard information at that state \\(x\\). That is, given what the\nwaiter knows when he is in that state. So, if \\(x\\) was the\nwaiter\u2019s information state before being informed that you\nordered the soda, \\(y\\) would have included the information that you\nordered the espresso, as each option was as good as the other until\nthe waiter was informed otherwise. There is an implicit assumption at\nwork here\u2014that some state \\(z\\) say, where you ordered both the\nsoda and the espresso, is not in the waiter\u2019s information-range.\nThat is, the waiter knows that \\(z\\) is not a possibility. Once\ninformed however, the information states supporting your ordering the\nespresso are eliminated from the range of information corresponding to\nthe waiter\u2019s knowledge.\n\nBasic modal logic extends propositional formulas with modal operators\nsuch as \\(K_{\\alpha}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) is the set of all Kripke\nmodels then we have the following: \n\\[\\begin{align} \\tag{A1} &\\mathbf{K} \\Vdash K_{\\alpha}\\phi \\wedge\nK_{\\alpha}(\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow K_{\\alpha}\\psi \\\\\n\\tag{A2} & \\mathbf{K} \\Vdash \\phi \\Rightarrow \\mathbf{K} \\Vdash\nK_{\\alpha}\\phi \\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIn hard information terms, (A1) states that hard information is closed\nunder (known) implications. Since the first conjunct states that all\nstates accessible by \\(\\alpha\\) are \\(\\phi\\) states, \\(\\alpha\\)\npossesses the hard information that \\(\\phi\\), hence \\(\\alpha\\) also\npossesses the hard information that \\(\\psi\\). (A2) states that if\n\\(\\phi\\) holds in the set of all models, then \\(\\alpha\\) possesses the\nhard information that \\(\\phi\\). In other words, (A2) states that all\ntautologies are known/hard stored by the agent, and (A1) states that\n\\(\\alpha\\) knows the logical consequences of all propositions that\n\\(\\alpha\\) knows (be they tautologies or otherwise). That is, the\naxioms state that the agent is logical omniscient, or an ideal\nreasoner, a property of agents that we will return to in detail\nin the sections\n below.[3]\n\nThe framework explored so far concerns single-agent epistemic logic,\nbut reasoning and information flow are very often multi-agent\naffairs. Consider again the waiter example. Importantly, the\nwaiter is only able to execute the relevant reasoning procedure\ncorresponding to a restriction of the range of information states\non account of your announcement to him with regard to the\nespresso. That is, it is the verbal interaction between several agents\nthat facilitates the information flow that enabled the logical\nreasoning to be undertaken.\n\nIt is at this point that multi-agent epistemic logic raises new\nquestions regarding the information in a group. \u201cEverybody in\n\\(G\\) possesses the hard information that \\(\\phi\\)\u201d (where \\(G\\)\nis any group of agents from a finite set of agents \\(G^*)\\) written as\n\\(E_G\\phi . E_G\\) is defined for each \\(G \\subseteq G^*\\) in the\nfollowing manner: \n\\[\\tag{2} E_G\\phi = \\bigwedge_{\\alpha \\in G} K_{\\alpha}\\phi \\]\n\n\nGroup knowledge is importantly different from common\nknowledge (Lewis 1969; Fagin et al. 1995). Common knowledge is\nthe condition of the group where everybody knows that everybody\nknows that everybody knows \u2026 that \\(\\phi\\). In other\nwords, common knowledge concerns the hard information that each agent\nin the group possesses about the hard information possessed by the\nother members of the group. That everybody in \\(G\\) possesses the hard\ninformation that \\(\\phi\\) does not imply that \\(\\phi\\) is common\nknowledge. With group knowledge each agent in the group may possess\nthe same hard information (hence achieving group knowledge) without\nnecessarily possessing hard information about the hard information\npossessed by the other agents in the group. As noted by van Ditmarsh,\nvan der Hoek, and Kooi (2008: 30), \u201cthe number of iterations of\nthe \\(E\\)-operator makes a real difference in practice\u201d.\n\\(C_G\\phi\\)\u2014the common knowledge that \\(\\phi\\) for\nmembers of \\(G\\), is defined as follows: \n\\[\\tag{3} C_G\\phi = \\bigwedge_{n=0}^{\\infty} E^n_G \\phi \\]\n\n\nTo appreciate the difference between \\(E\\) and \\(C\\), consider the\nfollowing \u201cspy example\u201d (originally Barwise 1988 with the\nenvelope details due to Johan van Benthem).\n\nThere are a group of competing spies at a formal dinner. All of them\nare tasked with the mission of acquiring some secret information from\ninside the restaurant. Furthermore, it is common knowledge amongst\nthem that they want the information. Given this much, compare the\nfollowing:\n\nEach spy knows that the information is in an envelope on one of\nthe other tables, but they don\u2019t know that the other spies know\nthis (i.e., it is not common knowledge).\nIt is common knowledge amongst the spies that the information is\nin the envelope.\n\n\nVery obviously, the two scenarios will elicit very different types of\nbehaviour from the spies. The first would be relatively subtle, the\nlatter dramatically less so. See Vanderschraaf and Sillari (2009) for\nfurther details.\n\nA still more fine-grained use of S5 based epistemic logics is that of\nZhou (2016). Zhou demonstrates that S5 based epistemic logic may be\nused to model the epistemic states of the agent from the perspective\nof the agent themselves. Hence Zhou refers to such an epistemic logic\nas internally epistemic. Zhou then uses a multi-valued logic\nto model the relationship between the agent\u2019s internal knowledge\nbase and their external informational environment. In his (2019), van\nBenthem argues for an understanding of modal logics in general (both\nepistemic and otherwise) as ariing from an explicit approach\nto increasing a logic\u2019s conceptual nuance \u2014 in the sense\nthat they are explicit extensions of classical logic. They wear their\nnew conceptual architechture on their sleaves, so to speak. This is in\ncontrast to those logics to which van Benthem refers as resulting from\nan implicit approach. This implicit approach invloves a\nreinterpretation of the meaning of logical vocabulary, as is the case\nwith intuitionistic logic and relevant logic as conceived of\ntraditionally. van Benthem\u2019s method of translating between\nequivalient (in a sense) implicit and explicit approaches has as an\ninstance that between Kit Fine\u2019s (2017) hyperintensional\ntruth-maker semantics and informationalised modal logic. This is a\npromising foray into such translations between a range of information\nlogics such as those addressed in this entry. \n",
