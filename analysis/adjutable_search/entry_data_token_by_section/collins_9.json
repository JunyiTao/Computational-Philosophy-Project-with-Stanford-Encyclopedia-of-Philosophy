    "main_text": "Collins, Deism and Freethinking || An Essay Concerning the Use of Reason, 1707\n4.1 An Essay Concerning the Use of Reason, 1707\n\nAn Essay Concerning the Use of Reason, Collins\u2019 first\nbook, was published anonymously in 1707 a little before his Letter\nto Mr. Dodwell. The main thrust of the book is to reject\nreligious mysteries. Collins starts his approach to the issues of\nreligion and reason along the same lines that Locke does. He defines\nreason as \u201cthat faculty of the Mind, whereby it perceives the\ntruth, Falsehood, Probability or Improbability of Propositions\u201d\n(1707 [1984: 3]). Propositions consist of words \u201cwhich stand for\nIdeas concerning which some agreement is affirm\u2019d or\ndeny\u2019d\u201d (1707 [1984: 3\u20134]). Thus he accepts\nLocke\u2019s definition of knowledge. He also distinguishes in the\nway Locke does intuitive, demonstrative and probable truths, and\ntreats claims about revelation as probable propositions that largely\nderive from testimony. Perhaps one diversion from Locke is that\nCollins distinguishes between two different kinds of probability. The\nstronger kind resembles demonstration but the connection between ideas\nis merely probable. The weaker kind of probability is a testimony.\nCollins\u2019 position is that a person is not expected to believe\nanything that is not comprehensible by the human intellect. So, if\nterms take on meanings that cannot be understood, humans cannot be\nexpected to believe them.\n\nO\u2019Higgins sees a strong affinity between Collins\u2019 book and\nJohn Toland\u2019s Christianity Not Mysterious, which had\nbeen published in 1696. He quotes Toland\u2019s remark that:\n\n\nWe hold that reason is the only foundation of all\ncertitude\u2026that nothing reveal\u2019d, whether as to its manner\nor to its existence, is more exempted from its disquisitions, than the\nordinary phenomena of nature\u2026that there is nothing in the\ngospel contrary to or above it.\n\n\nO\u2019Higgins claims that this is very much the position that\nCollins is taking in the Essay. In An Essay Concerning\nHuman Understanding Locke allowed that there were some truths\nthat were above reason but compatible with it. Some scholars regard\nthis as a mere verbal commitment to truths above reason, while others\nregard it as substantive. What is clear is that Locke would not accept\ntruths above and contrary to reason. On this point, Locke, Toland, and\nCollins are in complete agreement. Toland, however, has a more radical\nposition than Locke in that he rejects truths above reason, even where\nthese truths are compatible with reason (see Woolhouse 2007: 372).\nThus Toland would not accept the story of the rebellion of the angels\nor the claim that the dead shall rise. Collins, on the other hand,\nseems to hold the same position Locke does. He quotes with approval a\npassage from Robert Boyle who uses an analogy of a deep-sea diver to\nmake the distinction between above reason and contrary to reason\nplausible. If the diver asks you if you can see to the bottom of the\nocean and after you have declared that you cannot, brings up oysters\nwith pearls in them, you will have no objection to the claim that\nthere are oysters with pearls in them at the bottom of the sea. If, on\nthe other hand, the diver claims that the pearls he shows you are\nlarger than the shells containing them, \u201cyou would doubtless\njudge what he asserts contrary to the information of your eyes\u201d\n(Collins 1707 [1984: 25\u20136]). This sounds like Locke\u2019s\nposition. But Agnesina points out that Collins gives this analogy a\ntwist. He writes: \n\n\n\u2026Collins reduces Boyle\u2019s example to its conceptual\nscheme: it is simply a matter of acquisition of knowledge, not of a\ndifferent type or degree of knowledge. (Agnesina 2018: 149) \n\n\nThus Agnesina agrees with O\u2019Higgins that Collins holds the same\nposition as Toland: there are no truths above or contrary to\nreason.\n\nTurning from analogy to theological doctrines, we find that Collins\nrejecting transubstantiation (1707 [1984: 24]). Collins also objects\nto the doctrine of the Trinity because it is not understandable and on\nsome interpretations involves contradictions. Acceptance of the\ndoctrine of the Trinity is the first of the Thirty-nine Articles to\nwhich an Anglican was supposed to subscribe. It is plain that Collins,\nlike Locke, Newton, Clarke, Whiston, Toland, and others, objected to\nthis article. Many of these men concealed their views about the\nTrinity and claimed that they were orthodox Anglicans.\n\nGiven that Collins rejects mysteries and the claims that there are\ntruths above reason why should we accept any part of Holy Scripture?\nCollins holds that it is on account of testimony. Collins writes: \n\n\nThere are ideas join\u2019d in Propositions, which the Mind perceives\nto agree or disagree by the testimony of others. (Collins, 1707: 5)\n\n\n\nTestimony gives rise to a particular kind of knowledge,\nfaith. We learn about facts, current events, historical,\nscientific ones, and so on by having them communicated to us by\nothers. But testimony itself is not enough to produce faith or assent\nunless the people and events themselves are credible. Collins, like\nSpinoza in the Theological-Political Treatise concludes that\nthe writers of the Bible were not writing for philosophers, but\nadapted their expressions to the capacity of understanding of the bulk\nof mankind (Collins 1707: 14). Agnesina points out the similarity in\nCollins\u2019 conclusions not only with Spinoza, but Locke, Le Clerc,\nRichard Simon, and Toland. He remarks that these similarities:\n\n\n\u2026show what enormous pressure the Bible was subjected to in\nthose years. Freed from the Holiness that made it untouchable, it was\nnow minutely examined with the tools of philology. As may easily be\nimagined, this operation was exploited by the most radical thinkers,\nwho discredited its contradictions and inconsistencies, in order to\ngain credit for their own positions. From the opposing side, in a sort\nof contrasting action, the desire was growing to preserve the Bible\nand to \u2019update\u2019 according to the findings of science.\n(Agnesina 2018: 151)\n\n\nBesides the kinds of pressure just noted, there was the act of\ntoleration which came along with the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The\nAnglican Church in the 1690s was on edge as it saw its revenues\nfalling and debates about the fundamental doctrines of the Church were\nat a fever pitch. Thus, the advent of the Boyle Lectures to defend the\nviews of the Anglican Church and show their compatibility with\nNewtonian science is hardly surprising.\n",
