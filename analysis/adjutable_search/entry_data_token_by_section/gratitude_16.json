    "main_text": "Gratitude and Obligation || Reluctance to Receive Beneficence\n5.3 Gratitude and Political Obligation\n\nOne question that hinges on gratitude\u2019s deontological status is\nthe question of whether political\nobligation\u2014subjects\u2019 obligations to their\nstate\u2014can be derived from subjects\u2019 gratitude to the\nstate. Political obligation is often understood in the specific sense\nof obligation to obey the laws and decrees of the state. With this\nunderstanding in mind, the argument from gratitude for political\nobligation runs roughly as follows:\n\n(1)The state benefits its subjects.\n(2)Subjects therefore owe obligations of gratitude to the\nstate.\n(3)Among these is the obligation not to harm the\nstate.\n(4)Disobeying the state\u2019s decrees and laws harms\nthe state.\n(5)Therefore, subjects have an obligation to obey the\nstate\u2019s laws and decrees.\n\n\nThis argument has an ancient pedigree (depending on how one interprets\nPlato [Crito]), and it boasts certain theoretical advantages\nover other derivations of political obligation. It explains, for\ninstance, why subjects have obligations to their own particular state,\nrather than, say, to every state that is just or legitimate. It also\ndoes a better job than other theories of political obligation at\nexplaining why refugees seem to have prima facie obligations to obey\nthe laws of their host countries, at least when those refugees are\ntreated generously, fairly and respectfully (D\u2019Cruz 2014). The\nargument from gratitude for political obligation has also been the\ntarget of many objections.\n\nOne set of objections targets the inference from (1) to (2), arguing\nthat even if the state benefits its subjects, it does not do so in a\nway that calls for gratitude (see\n section 2).\n Some might doubt, in the first place, whether a state, as a non-human\nentity, is capable of intentionally benefiting anyone. In\nresponse to this objection, A.D.M. Walker (1988) points out that we\nsometimes feel gratitude to schools or universities we\u2019ve\nattended for what we take to have been their goodwill or benevolence\ntoward their students. It might be doubted whether states can be the\nproper objects of obligations\u2014that is, whether they are capable\nof having obligations owed to them. As Terrance McConnell (1993)\nnotes, though, we seem to be able to owe obligations of repayment to\ncorporations that have lent us money. Furthermore, the fact that\ninstitutions seem to be able to owe gratitude to individuals suggests\nthat they should be capable of deserving it from individuals as well\n(McConnell 1993: 196).\n\nStates\u2019 agential capacities aside, there are several reasons to\ndoubt whether states have the primary intention of benefiting their\nsubjects and whether states actually sacrifice in granting the\nbenefits they grant (Simmons 1979: 185\u2013188). In the first place,\nthe fact that states receive taxes from their citizens in exchange for\nthe benefits they confer seems to undermine the claim that beneficence\nis a state\u2019s primary intention, and that states make sacrifices\nin order to benefit their subjects. Defenders of the link between (1)\nand (2) might point out that many states spend more money conferring\nbenefits on their subjects than they take in from taxes. They might\nalso note that many subjects receive great benefits from the state\ndespite paying few or no taxes (Walker 1988: 209). Critics, however,\npoint out that every tax-paying subject\u2014even those who pay\nminimal taxes\u2014is forced by the state to pay them (Klosko 1989:\n354; Wellman 1999a: 73). Someone who forces benefits on me, and forces\nme to pay a share for them, may thereby undermine his desert of\ngratitude. Finally, it might be argued that even if the state provides\nsome benefits to its subjects, and provides them intentionally, the\nstate may still lose its claim to gratitude if it subsequently harms\nthose subjects, which many states do through unjust laws or other\ntypes of repression and persecution.\n\nOther critics of the argument from gratitude might concede (2), that\nsubjects owe gratitude to the state, and (3), that this entails a\nspecific obligation not to harm the state, but deny (4), that\ndisobeying the state\u2019s decrees and laws actually harms the\nstate. Such critics could argue that while flouting a state\u2019s\nlaws and decrees might undermine general compliance with those laws,\ndisobeying them secretly or privately need not lead to this\nconsequence. They might also argue that publicly disobeying laws and\ndecrees might not harm the state insofar as those laws and decrees are\nunjust. Public acts of civil disobedience against unjust laws might\nactually improve the state, insofar as they hasten the abolition of\nthose laws, and those laws are detrimental to the state.\n\nIn light of these objections, several philosophers have fallen back on\na version of the argument from gratitude with a weaker and more\nlimited conclusion. Considerations of gratitude, they argue, might\nground the claim that some subjects have some\nobligations of gratitude to the state. McConnell (1993) suggests that\nonly those who have been benefited by the state, and not subsequently\ntreated unfairly by it, might owe the state obligations of gratitude.\nAs for the specific obligations these subjects owe to the state, they\nmay not include the obligation to obey laws and decrees (cf. D\u2019Cruz\n2014); but they may include certain other obligations of wider\nlatitude, e.g., to aid one\u2019s own country in various ways,\nparticipate in civic organizations, vote, or volunteer for a year of\nnational service (McConnell 1993: 207). Ingratitude to the state may\nalso justify special punishment for treason, or for acts aimed\nsquarely at the destruction of the state. Insofar as the state claims\nthe right to compel every subject\u2019s obedience to the laws,\nthough, obligations of gratitude could not be the whole justification\nfor political obligation generally (Klosko 1989: 358).\n\nThe argument from gratitude for political obligation, even in its\nweaker form, might have important ramifications for questions of\npolitical obligation and political authority more generally. For\ninstance, if some subjects have obligations of gratitude to the state,\nand obligations of gratitude cannot be exacted or demanded, then the\nquestion of political obligation (what obligations a subject owes to\nthe state) and the question of political authority (what the state has\na right to demand of its subjects) do not have coextensive answers\n(McConnell 1993: 208).\n",
