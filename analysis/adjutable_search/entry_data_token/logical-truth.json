A widespread, perhaps universally accepted idea is that\npart of what should distinguish logical truths from other kinds of\ntruths is that logical truths should have a yet to be fully understood\nmodal force. It is typical to hold that, in some sense or senses of\n\u201ccould\u201d, a logical truth could not be false or,\nalternatively, that in some sense or senses of \u201cmust\u201d, a\nlogical truth must be true. But there is little if any agreement about\nhow the relevant modality should be understood.\n\nAnother widespread idea is that part of what should distinguish\nlogical truths is that they should be in some sense yet to be fully\nunderstood \u201cformal\u201d. That a logical truth is formal\nimplies at the very least that all the sentences which are appropriate\nreplacement instances of its logical form are logical truths too. In\nthis context, the logical form of a sentence \\(S\\) is supposed to be a\ncertain schema determined uniquely by \\(S\\), a schema of which \\(S\\)\nis a replacement instance, and of which sentences with the same form\nas \\(S\\) are replacement instances too. A form has at the very least\nthe property that the expressions in it which are not schematic\nletters (the \u201clogical expressions\u201d) are widely applicable\nacross different areas of discourse. Among people who accept the idea\nof formality there would be wide agreement that the forms of (1), (2)\nand (3) would be something like \\((1')\\), \\((2')\\) and \\((3')\\)\nrespectively:\n\n\\((1')\\)  If \\(a\\) is\n\\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is \\(Q\\), and \\(a\\) is \\(P\\), then \\(b\\) is \\(Q\\).\n\n\\((2')\\)  If no \\(Q\\)\nis \\(R\\) and some \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\)s, then some \\(P\\)s are not \\(R\\).\n\n\\((3')\\)  If \\(a\\) is a\n\\(P\\) and all \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\), then \\(a\\) is \\(Q\\). \n\n\n\\((1')\\), \\((2')\\) and \\((3')\\) do seem to give rise to sentences that\nintuitively must be true for all appropriate replacements of the\nletters \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(P\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(Q\\)\u201d, and \u201c\\(R\\)\u201d. And expressions such as\n\u201cif\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201csome\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, etc., which are paradigmatic logical expressions,\ndo seem to be widely applicable across different areas of discourse.\nBut the idea that logical truths are or should be formal is certainly\nnot universally accepted. And even among those who accept it, there is\nlittle if any agreement about what generic criteria determine the form\nof an arbitrary\n sentence.[1]\n\nA remarkable fact about logical truth is that many have thought it\nplausible that the set of logical truths of certain rich formalized\nlanguages is characterizable in terms of concepts of standard\nmathematics. In particular, on some views the set of logical truths of\na language of that kind is always the set of sentences of the language\nderivable in a certain calculus. On other, more widespread views, the\nset of logical truths of a language of that kind can be identified\nwith the set of sentences that are valid across a certain range of\nmathematical interpretations (where validity is something related to\nbut different from the condition that all the sentences that are\nreplacement instances of its form be true too; see below, section\n2.3). One main achievement of early mathematical logic was precisely\nto show how to characterize notions of derivability and validity in\nterms of concepts of standard mathematics. (Sections 2.2 and 2.3 give\na basic description of the standard mathematically characterized\nnotions of derivability and validity for standard quantificational\nlanguages, with references to other entries.)\n\nIn part 1 of this entry we will describe in very broad outline the\nmain existing views about how to understand the ideas of modality and\nformality relevant to logical truth. (A more detailed treatment of\nthese views is available in other entries mentioned below, and\nespecially in the entries on the\n analytic/synthetic distinction\n and\n logical constants.)\n In part 2 we will describe, also in outline, a particular set of\nphilosophical issues that arise when one considers the attempted\nmathematical characterizations of logical truth. The question of\nwhether or in what sense these characterizations are correct is bound\nwith the question of what is or should be our specific understanding\nof the ideas of modality and\n formality.[2]\n", "toc": [{"#NatLogTru": "1.

The Nature of Logical Truth\n1.1 Modality\n\nAs we said above, it seems to be universally accepted that, if there\nare any logical truths at all, a logical truth ought to be such that\nit could not be false, or equivalently, it ought to be such that it\nmust be true. But as we also said, there is virtually no agreement\nabout the specific character of the pertinent modality.\n\nExcept among those who reject the notion of logical truth altogether,\nor those who, while accepting it, reject the notion of logical form,\nthere is wide agreement that at least part of the modal force of a\nlogical truth ought to be due to its being a particular case of a true\nuniversal generalization over the possible values of the schematic\nletters in \u201cformal\u201d schemata like \\((1')-(3')\\). (These\nvalues may but need not be expressions.) On what is possibly the\noldest way of understanding the logical modality, that modal force is\nentirely due to this property: thus, for example, on this view to say\nthat (1) must be true can only mean that (1) is a particular case of\nthe true universal generalization \u201cFor all suitable \\(P\\),\n\\(Q\\), \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), if \\(a\\) is a \\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is a \\(Q\\),\nand \\(a\\) is a \\(P\\), then \\(b\\) is a \\(Q\\)\u201d. On one traditional\n(but not uncontroversial) interpretation, Aristotle's claim that the\nconclusion of a syllogismos must be true if the premises are\ntrue ought to be understood in this way. In a famous passage of the\nPrior Analytics, he says: \u201cA syllogismos is\nspeech (logos) in which, certain things being supposed,\nsomething other than the things supposed results of necessity (ex\nanankes) because they are so\u201d (24b18\u201320). Think of\n(2) as a syllogismos in which the \u201cthings\nsupposed\u201d are (2a) and (2b), and in which the thing that\n\u201cresults of necessity\u201d is (2c):\n\n(2a)  No desire is\nvoluntary. \n(2b)  Some beliefs are\ndesires. \n(2c)  Some beliefs are\nnot voluntary. \n\n\nOn the interpretation we are describing, Aristotle's view is that to\nsay that (2c) results of necessity from (2a) and (2b) is to say that\n(2) is a particular case of the true universal generalization\n\u201cFor all suitable \\(P\\), \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), if no \\(Q\\) is \\(R\\)\nand some \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\)s, then some \\(P\\)s are not \\(R\\)\u201d. For\nthis interpretation see e.g. Alexander of Aphrodisias, 208.16 (quoted\nby \u0141ukasiewicz 1957, \u00a741), Bolzano (1837, \u00a7155) and\n\u0141ukasiewicz (1957, \u00a75).\n\nIn many other ancient and medieval logicians, \u201cmust\u201d\nclaims are understood as universal generalizations about actual items\n(even if they are not always understood as universal generalizations\non \u201cformal\u201d schemata). Especially prominent is Diodorus'\nview that a proposition is necessary just in case it is true at all\ntimes (see Mates 1961, III, \u00a73). Note that this makes sense of\nthe idea that (2) must be true but, say, \u201cPeople watch TV\u201d\ncould be false, for surely this sentence was not true in Diodorus'\ntime. Diodorus' view appears to have been very common in the Middle\nAges, when authors like William of Sherwood and Walter Burley seem to\nhave understood the perceived necessity of conditionals like (2) as\ntruth at all times (see Knuuttila 1982, pp. 348\u20139). An\nunderstanding of necessity as eternity is frequent also in later\nauthors; see e.g., Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, B 184. In\nfavor of the mentioned interpretation of Aristotle and of the\nDiodorean view it might be pointed out that we often use modal\nlocutions to stress the consequents of conditionals that follow from\nmere universal generalizations about the actual world, as in \u201cIf\ngas prices go up, necessarily the economy slows down\u201d.\n\nMany authors have thought that views of this sort do not account for\nthe full strength of the modal import of logical truths. A nowadays\nvery common, but (apparently) late view in the history of philosophy,\nis that the necessity of a logical truth does not merely imply that\nsome generalization about actual items holds, but also implies that\nthe truth would have been true at a whole range of counterfactual\ncircumstances. Leibniz assigned this property to necessary truths such\nas those of logic and geometry, and seems to have been one of the\nfirst to speak of the counterfactual circumstances as \u201cpossible\nuniverses\u201d or worlds (see the letter to Bourguet, pp.\n572\u20133, for a crisp statement of his views that contrasts them\nwith the views in the preceding paragraph; Knuuttila 1982, pp. 353 ff.\ndetects the earliest transparent talk of counterfactual circumstances\nand of necessity understood as at least implying truth in all of these\nin Duns Scotus and Buridan; see also the entry on\n medieval theories of modality).\n In contemporary writings the understanding of necessity as truth in\nall counterfactual circumstances, and the view that logical truths are\nnecessary in this sense, are widespread\u2014although many, perhaps\nmost, authors adopt \u201creductivist\u201d views of modality that\nsee talk of counterfactual circumstances as no more than disguised\ntalk about certain actualized (possibly abstract) items, such as\nlinguistic descriptions. Even Leibniz seems to have thought of his\n\u201cpossible universes\u201d as ideas in the mind of God. (See\nLewis 1986 for an introduction to the contemporary polemics in this\narea.)\n\nHowever, even after Leibniz and up to the present, many logicians seem\nto have avoided a commitment to a strong notion of necessity as truth\nin all (actual and) counterfactual circumstances. Thus Bolzano, in\nline with his interpretation of Aristotle mentioned above,\ncharacterizes necessary propositions as those whose negation is\nincompatible with purely general truths (see Bolzano 1837, \u00a7119).\nFrege says that \u201cthe apodictic judgment [i.e., roughly, the\njudgment whose content begins with a \u2018necessarily\u2019\ngoverning the rest of the content] is distinguished from the assertory\nin that it suggests the existence of universal judgments from which\nthe proposition can be inferred, while in the case of the assertory\none such a suggestion is lacking\u201d (Frege 1879, \u00a74). Tarski\nis even closer to the view traditionally attributed to Aristotle, for\nit is pretty clear that for him to say that e.g. (2c)\n\u201cmust\u201d be true if (2a) and (2b) are true is to say that\n(2) is a particular case of the \u201cformal\u201d generalization\n\u201cFor all suitable \\(P\\), \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), if no \\(Q\\) is \\(R\\)\nand some \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\)s, then some \\(P\\)s are not \\(R\\)\u201d (see\nTarski 1936a, pp. 411, 415, 417, or the corresponding passages in\nTarski 1936b; see also Ray 1996). Quine is known for his explicit\nrejection of any modality that cannot be understood in terms of\nuniversal generalizations about the actual world (see especially Quine\n1963). In some of these cases, this attitude is explained by a\ndistrust of notions that are thought not to have reached a fully\nrespectable scientific status, like the strong modal notions; it is\nfrequently accompanied in such authors, who are often practicing\nlogicians, by the proposal to characterize logical truth as a species\nof validity (in the sense of 2.3 below). (See Williamson 2013, ch. 3,\nand 2017, for a recent endorsement of the idea that logical truths are\nto be seen as instances of true universal generalizations over their\nlogical forms, based on the scientific or \u201cabductive\u201d\nfruitfulness of the idea, though not on a disdain of modal\nnotions.)\n\nOn a recent view developed by Beall and Restall (2000, 2006), called\nby them \u201clogical pluralism\u201d, the concept of logical truth\ncarries a commitment to the idea that a logical truth is true in all\nof a range of items or \u201ccases\u201d, and its necessity consists\nin the truth of such a general claim (see Beall and Restall 2006, p.\n24). However, the concept of logical truth does not single out a\nunique range of \u201ccases\u201d as privileged in determining an\nextension for the concept, or, what amounts to the same thing, the\nuniversal generalization over a logical form can be interpreted via\ndifferent equally acceptable ranges of quantification; instead, there\nare many such equally acceptable ranges and corresponding extensions\nfor \u201clogical truth\u201d, which may be chosen as a function of\ncontextual interests. This means that, for the logical pluralist, many\nsets have a right to be called \u201cthe set of logical truths\u201d\n(and \u201cthe set of logical necessities\u201d), each in the\nappropriate\n context.[3]\n (See the entry on\n logical pluralism.)\n On another recent understanding of logical necessity as a species of\ngenerality, proposed by Rumfitt (2015), the necessity of a logical\ntruth consists just in its being usable under all sets of\nsubject-specific ways of drawing implications (provided these sets\nsatisfy certain structural rules); or, more roughly, just in its being\napplicable no matter what sort of reasoning is at stake. On this view,\na more substantive understanding of the modality at stake in logical\ntruth is again not required. It may be noted that, although he\npostulates a variety of subject-specific implication relations,\nRumfitt rejects pluralism about logical truth in the sense of Beall\nand Restall (see his 2015, p. 56, n. 23.), and in fact thinks that the\nset of logical truths in a standard quantificational language is\ncharacterized by the standard classical logic.\n\nYet another sense in which it has been thought that truths like\n(1)-(3), and logical truths quite generally, \u201ccould\u201d not\nbe false or \u201cmust\u201d be true is epistemic. It is an old\nobservation, going at least as far back as Plato, that some truths\ncount as intuitively known by us even in cases where we don't seem to\nhave any empirical grounds for them. Truths that are knowable on\nnon-empirical grounds are called a priori (an expression that\nbegins to be used with this meaning around the time of Leibniz; see\ne.g. his \u201cPrim\u00e6 Veritates\u201d, p. 518). The axioms and\ntheorems of mathematics, the lexicographic and stipulative\ndefinitions, and also the paradigmatic logical truths, have been given\nas examples. If it is accepted that logical truths are a\npriori, it is natural to think that they must be true or could\nnot be false at least partly in the strong sense that their negations\nare incompatible with what we are able to know non-empirically.\n\nAssuming that such a priori knowledge exists in some way or\nother, much recent philosophy has occupied itself with the issue of\nhow it is possible. One traditional (\u201crationalist\u201d) view\nis that the mind is equipped with a special capacity to perceive\ntruths through the examination of the relations between pure ideas or\nconcepts, and that the truths reached through the correct operation of\nthis capacity count as known a priori. (See, e.g., Leibniz's\n\u201cDiscours de M\u00e9taphysique\u201d, \u00a7\u00a723 ff.;\nRussell 1912, p. 105; BonJour 1998 is a very recent example of a view\nof this sort.) An opposing traditional (\u201cempiricist\u201d) view\nis that there is no reason to postulate that capacity, or even that\nthere are reasons not to postulate it, such as that it is\n\u201cmysterious\u201d. (See the entry on\n rationalism vs. empiricism.)\n Some philosophers, empiricists and otherwise, have attempted to\nexplain a priori knowledge as arising from some sort of\nconvention or tacit agreement to assent to certain sentences (such as\n(1)) and use certain rules. Hobbes in his objections to Descartes'\nMeditations (\u201cThird Objections\u201d, IV, p. 608)\nproposes a wide-ranging conventionalist view. The later Wittgenstein\n(on one interpretation) and Carnap are distinguished proponents of\n\u201ctacit agreement\u201d and conventionalist views (see e.g.\nWittgenstein 1978, I.9, I.142; Carnap 1939, \u00a712, and 1963, p.\n916, for informal exposition of Carnap's views; see also Coffa 1991,\nchs. 14 and 17). Strictly speaking, Wittgenstein and Carnap think that\nlogical truths do not express propositions at all, and are just\nvacuous sentences that for some reason or other we find useful to\nmanipulate; thus it is only in a somewhat diminished sense that we can\nspeak of (a priori) knowledge of them. However, in typical\nrecent exponents of \u201ctacit agreement\u201d and conventionalist\nviews, such as Boghossian (1997), the claim that logical truths do not\nexpress propositions is rejected, and it is accepted that the\nexistence of the agreement provides full-blown a priori\nknowledge of those propositions.\n\nThe \u201crational capacity\u201d view and the\n\u201cconventionalist\u201d view agree that, in a broad sense, the\nepistemic ground of logical truths resides in our ability to analyze\nthe meanings of their expressions, be these understood as conventions\nor as objective ideas. For this reason it can be said that they\nexplain the apriority of logical truths in terms of their analyticity.\n(See the entry on the\n analytic/synthetic distinction.)\n Kant's explanation of the apriority of logical truths has seemed\nharder to\n extricate.[4]\n A long line of commentators of Kant has noted that, if Kant's view is\nthat all logical truths are analytic, this would seem to be in tension\nwith his characterizations of analytic truths. Kant characterizes\nanalytic truths as those where the concept of the predicate is\ncontained in or identical with the concept of the subject, and, more\nfundamentally, as those whose denial is contradictory. But it has\nappeared to those commentators that these characterizations, while\napplying to strict tautologies such as \u201cMen are men\u201d or\n\u201cBearded men are men\u201d, would seem to leave out much of\nwhat Kant himself counts as logically true, including syllogisms such\nas (2) (see e.g. Mill 1843, bk. II, ch. vi, \u00a75; Husserl 1901,\nvol. II, pt. 2, \u00a766; Kneale and Kneale 1962, pp. 357\u20138;\nParsons 1967; Maddy 1999). This and the apparent lack of clear\npronouncements of Kant on the issue has led at least Maddy (1999) and\nHanna (2001) to consider (though not accept) the hypothesis that Kant\nviewed some logical truths as synthetic a priori. On an\ninterpretation of this sort, the apriority of many logical truths\nwould be explained by the fact that they would be required by the\ncognitive structure of the transcendental subject, and specifically by\nthe forms of\n judgment.[5]\n But the standard interpretation is to attribute to Kant the view that\nall logical truths are analytic (see e.g. Capozzi and Roncaglia 2009).\nOn an interpretation of this sort, Kant's forms of judgment may be\nidentified with logical concepts susceptible of analysis (see e.g.\nAllison 1983, pp. 126ff.). An extended defense of the interpretation\nthat Kant viewed all logical truths as analytic, including a\nvindication of Kant against the objections of the line of commentators\nmentioned above, can be found in Hanna (2001), \u00a73.1. A\nsubstantively Kantian contemporary theory of the epistemology of logic\nand its roots in cognition is developed in Hanna (2006); this theory\ndoes not seek to explain the apriority of logic in terms of its\nanalyticity, and appeals instead to a specific kind of logical\nintuition and a specific cognitive logic faculty. (Compare also the\nanti-aprioristic and anti-analytic but broadly Kantian view of Maddy\n2007, mentioned below.)\n\nThe early Wittgenstein shares with Kant the idea that the logical\nexpressions do not express meanings in the way that non-logical\nexpressions do (see 1921, 4.0312). Consistently with this view, he\nclaims that logical truths do not \u201csay\u201d anything (1921,\n6.11). But he seems to reject conventionalist and \u201ctacit\nagreement\u201d views (1921, 6.124, 6.1223). It is not that logical\ntruths do not say anything because they are mere instruments for some\nsort of extrinsically useful manipulation; rather, they\n\u201cshow\u201d the \u201clogical properties\u201d that the world\nhas independently of our decisions (1921, 6.12, 6.13). It is unclear\nhow apriority is explainable in this framework. Wittgenstein calls the\nlogical truths analytic (1921, 6.11), and says that \u201cone can\nrecognize in the symbol alone that they are true\u201d (1921, 6.113).\nHe seems to have in mind the fact that one can \u201csee\u201d that\na logical truth of truth-functional logic must be valid by inspection\nof a suitable representation of its truth-functional content (1921,\n6.1203, 6.122). But the extension of the idea to quantificational\nlogic is problematic, despite Wittgenstein's efforts to reduce\nquantificational logic to truth-functional logic; as we now know,\nthere is no algorithm for deciding if a quantificational sentence is\nvalid. What is perhaps more important, Wittgenstein gives no\ndiscernible explanation of why in principle all the \u201clogical\nproperties\u201d of the world should be susceptible of being\nreflected in an adequate notation.\n\nAgainst the \u201crational capacity\u201d,\n\u201cconventionalist\u201d, Kantian and early Wittgensteinian\nviews, other philosophers, especially radical empiricists and\nnaturalists (not to speak of epistemological skeptics), have rejected\nthe claim that a priori knowledge exists (hence by\nimplication also the claim that analytic propositions exist), and they\nhave proposed instead that there is only an illusion of apriority.\nOften this rejection has been accompanied by criticism of the other\nviews. J.S. Mill thought that propositions like (2) seem a\npriori merely because they are particular cases of early and very\nfamiliar generalizations that we derive from experience, like\n\u201cFor all suitable \\(P\\), \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), if no \\(Q\\) is \\(R\\)\nand some \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\)s, then some \\(P\\)s are not \\(R\\)\u201d (see\nMill 1843, bk. II, ch. viii). Bolzano held a similar view (see Bolzano\n1837, \u00a7315). Quine (1936, \u00a7III) famously criticized the\nHobbesian view noting that since the logical truths are infinite in\nnumber, our ground for them must not lie just in a finite number of\nexplicit conventions, for logical rules are presumably needed to\nderive an infinite number of logical truths from a finite number of\nconventions (an argument derived from Carroll 1895; see Soames 2018,\nch. 10, for exposition and G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2019 for criticism of\nthe argument). Later Quine (especially 1954) criticized Carnap's\nconventionalist view, largely on the grounds that there seems to be no\nnon-vague distinction between conventional truths and truths that are\ntacitly left open for refutation, and that to the extent that some\ntruths are the product of convention or \u201ctacit agreement\u201d,\nsuch agreement is characteristic of many scientific hypotheses and\nother postulations that seem paradigmatically non-analytic. (See Grice\nand Strawson 1956 and Carnap 1963 for reactions to these criticisms.)\nQuine (especially 1951) also argued that accepted sentences in\ngeneral, including paradigmatic logical truths, can be best seen as\nsomething like hypotheses that are used to deal with experience, any\nof which can be rejected if this helps make sense of the empirical\nworld (see Putnam 1968 for a similar view and a purported example). On\nthis view there cannot be strictly a priori grounds for any\ntruth. Three recent subtle anti-aprioristic positions are Maddy's\n(2002, 2007), Azzouni's (2006, 2008), and Sher's (2013). For Maddy,\nlogical truths are a posteriori, but they cannot be\ndisconfirmed merely by observation and experiment, since they form\npart of very basic ways of thinking of ours, deeply embedded in our\nconceptual machinery (a conceptual machinery that is structurally\nsimilar to Kant's postulated transcendental organization of the\nunderstanding). Similarly, for Azzouni logical truths are equally\na posteriori, though our sense that they must be true comes\nfrom their being psychologically deeply ingrained; unlike Maddy,\nhowever, Azzouni thinks that the logical rules by which we reason are\nopaque to introspection. Sher provides an attempt at combining a\nQuinean epistemology of logic with a commitment to a metaphysically\nrealist view of the modal ground of logical truth.\n\nOne way in which a priori knowledge of a logical truth such\nas (1) would be possible would be if a priori knowledge of\nthe fact that (1) is a logical truth, or of the universal\ngeneralization \u201cFor all suitable \\(a\\), \\(P\\), \\(b\\) and \\(Q\\),\nif \\(a\\) is \\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is \\(Q\\), and \\(a\\) is \\(P\\), then\n\\(b\\) is \\(Q\\)\u201d were possible. One especially noteworthy kind of\nskeptical consideration in the epistemology of logic is that the\npossibility of inferential a priori knowledge of these facts\nseems to face a problem of circularity or of infinite regress. If we\nare to obtain inferential a priori knowledge of those facts,\nthen we will presumably follow logical rules at some point, including\npossibly the rule of modus ponens whose very correctness\nmight well depend in part on the fact that (1) is a logical truth or\non the truth of the universal generalization \u201cFor all suitable\n\\(a\\), \\(P\\), \\(b\\) and \\(Q\\), if \\(a\\) is \\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is\n\\(Q\\), and \\(a\\) is \\(P\\), then \\(b\\) is \\(Q\\)\u201d. In any case, it\nseems clear that not all claims of this latter kind, expressing that a\ncertain truth is a logical truth or that a certain logical schema is\ntruth-preserving, could be given an a priori inferential\njustification without the use of some of the same logical rules whose\ncorrectness they might be thought to codify. The point can again be\nreasonably derived from Carroll (1895). Some of the recent literature\non this consideration, and on anti-skeptical rejoinders, includes\nDummett (1973, 1991) and Boghossian (2000).\n1.2 Formality\n\nOn most views, even if it were true that logical truths are true in\nall counterfactual circumstances, a priori, and analytic,\nthis would not give sufficient conditions for a truth to be a logical\ntruth. On most views, a logical truth also has to be in some sense\n\u201cformal\u201d, and this implies at least that all truths that\nare replacement instances of its form are logical truths too (and\nhence, on the assumption of the preceding sentence, true in all\ncounterfactual circumstances, a priori, and analytic). To use\na slight modification of an example of Albert of Saxony (quoted by\nBoche\u0144ski 1956, \u00a730.07), \u201cIf a widow runs, then a\nfemale runs\u201d should be true in all counterfactual circumstances,\na priori, and analytic if any truth is. However, \u201cIf a\nwidow runs, then a log runs\u201d is a replacement instance of its\nform, and in fact it even has the same form on any view of logical\nform (something like \u201cIf a \\(P\\) \\(Q\\)s, then an \\(R\\)\n\\(Q\\)s\u201d), but it is not even true simpliciter. So on\nmost views, \u201cIf a widow runs, then a female runs\u201d is not a\nlogical truth.\n\nFor philosophers who accept the idea of formality, as we said above,\nthe logical form of a sentence is a certain schema in which the\nexpressions that are not schematic letters are widely applicable\nacross different areas of\n discourse.[6]\n If the schema is the form of a logical truth, all of its replacement\ninstances are logical truths. The idea that logic is especially\nconcerned with (replacement instances of) schemata is of course\nevident beginning with Aristotle and the Stoics, in all of whom the\nword usually translated by \u201cfigure\u201d is precisely\nschema. In Aristotle a figure is actually an even more\nabstract form of a group of what we would now call\n\u201cschemata\u201d, such as (2\u2032). Our schemata are closer to\nwhat in the Aristotelian syllogistic are the moods; but there seems to\nbe no word for \u201cmood\u201d in Aristotle (except possibly\nptoseon in 42b30 or tropon in 43a10; see Smith 1989,\npp. 148\u20139), and thus no general reflection on the notion of\nformal schemata. There is explicit reflection on the contrast between\nthe formal schemata or moods and the matter (hyle) of\nsyllogismoi in Alexander of Aphrodisias (53.28ff., quoted by\nBoche\u0144ski 1956, \u00a724.06), and there has been ever since. The\nmatter are the values of the schematic letters.\n\nThe idea that the non-schematic expressions in logical forms, i.e. the\nlogical expressions, are widely applicable across different areas of\ndiscourse is also present from the beginning of logic, and recurs in\nall the great logicians. It appears indirectly in many passages from\nAristotle, such as the following: \u201cAll the sciences are related\nthrough the common things (I call common those which they use in order\nto demonstrate from them, but not those that are demonstrated in them\nor those about which something is demonstrated); and logic is related\nto them all, as it is a science that attempts to demonstrate\nuniversally the common things\u201d (Posterior Analytics,\n77a26\u20139); \u201cwe don't need to take hold of the things of all\nrefutations, but only of those that are characteristic of logic; for\nthese are common to every technique and ability\u201d\n(Sophistical Refutations, 170a34\u20135). (In these texts\n\u201clogic\u201d is an appropriate translation of\ndialektike; see Kneale and Kneale 1962, I, \u00a73, who\ninform us that logike is used for the first time with its\ncurrent meaning in Alexander of Aphrodisias.) Frege says that\n\u201cthe firmest proof is obviously the purely logical, which,\nprescinding from the particularity of things, is based solely on the\nlaws on which all knowledge rests\u201d (1879, p. 48; see also 1885,\nwhere the universal applicability of the arithmetical concepts is\ntaken as a sign of their logicality). The same idea is conspicuous as\nwell in Tarski (1941, ch. II, \u00a76).\n\nThat logical expressions include paradigmatic cases like\n\u201cif\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201csome\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, etc., and that they must be widely applicable\nacross different areas of discourse is what we might call \u201cthe\nminimal thesis\u201d about logical expressions. But beyond this there\nis little if any agreement about what generic feature makes an\nexpression logical, and hence about what determines the logical form\nof a sentence. Most authors sympathetic to the idea that logic is\nformal have tried to go beyond the minimal thesis. It would be\ngenerally agreed that being widely applicable across different areas\nof discourse is only a necessary, not sufficient property of logical\nexpressions; for example, presumably most prepositions are widely\napplicable, but they are not logical expressions on any implicit\ngeneric notion of a logical expression. Attempts to enrich the notion\nof a logical expression have typically sought to provide further\nproperties that collectively amount to necessary and sufficient\nconditions for an expression to be logical.\n\nOne idea that has been used in such characterizations, and that is\nalso present in Aristotle, is that logical expressions do not,\nstrictly speaking, signify anything; or, that they do not signify\nanything in the way that substantives, adjectives and verbs signify\nsomething. \u201cLogic [dialektike] is not a science of\ndetermined things, or of any one genus\u201d (Posterior\nAnalytics, 77a32\u20133). We saw that the idea was still present\nin Kant and the early Wittgenstein. It reemerged in the Middle Ages.\nThe main sense of the word \u201csyncategorematic\u201d as applied\nto expressions was roughly this semantic sense (see Kretzmann 1982,\npp. 212 ff.). Buridan and other late medieval logicians proposed that\ncategorematic expressions constitute the \u201cmatter\u201d of\nsentences while the syncategorematic expressions constitute their\n\u201cform\u201d (see the text quoted by Boche\u0144ski 1956,\n\u00a726.11). (In a somewhat different, earlier, grammatical sense of\nthe word, syncategorematic expressions were said to be those that\ncannot be used as subjects or predicates in categorical propositions;\nsee Kretzmann 1982, pp. 211\u20132.) The idea of syncategorematicity\nis somewhat imprecise, but there are serious doubts that it can serve\nto characterize the idea of a logical expression, whatever this may\nbe. Most prepositions and adverbs are presumably syncategorematic, but\nthey are also presumably non-logical expressions. Conversely,\npredicates such as \u201care identical\u201d, \u201cis identical\nwith itself\u201d, \u201cis both identical and not identical with\nitself\u201d, etc., which are resolutely treated as logical in recent\nlogic, are presumably categorematic. (They are of course categorematic\nin the grammatical sense, in which prepositions and adverbs are\nequally clearly syncategorematic.)\n\nMost other proposals have tried to delineate in some other way the\nAristotelian idea that the logical expressions have some kind of\n\u201cinsubstantial\u201d meaning, so as to use it as a necessary\nand sufficient condition for logicality. One recent suggestion is that\nlogical expressions are those that do not allow us to distinguish\ndifferent individuals. One way in which this has been made precise is\nthrough the characterization of logical expressions as those whose\nextension or denotation over any particular domain of individuals is\ninvariant under permutations of that domain. (See Tarski and Givant\n1987, p. 57, and Tarski 1966; for related proposals see also McCarthy\n1981, Sher 1991, ch. 3, McGee 1996, Feferman 1999, Bonnay 2008, Woods\n2016 and Griffiths and Paseau 2022, among others.) A permutation of a\ndomain is a one-to-one correspondence between the domain and itself.\nFor example, if \\(D\\) is the domain {Aristotle, Caesar, Napoleon,\nKripke}, one permutation is the correspondence that assigns each man\nto himself; another is the correspondence \\(P\\) that assigns Caesar to\nAristotle (in mathematical notation,\n\\(P(\\text{Aristotle})=\\text{Caesar}\\)), Napoleon to Caesar, Kripke to\nNapoleon, and Aristotle to Kripke. That the extension of an expression\nover a domain is invariant under a permutation of that domain means\nthat the induced image of that extension under the permutation is the\nextension itself (the \u201cinduced image\u201d of an extension\nunder a permutation \\(Q\\) is what the extension becomes when in place\nof each object \\(o\\) one puts the object \\(Q(o)\\)). The extension of\n\u201cphilosopher\u201d over \\(D\\) is not invariant under the\npermutation \\(P\\) above, for that extension is \\(\\{\\text{Aristotle},\n\\text{Kripke}\\}\\), whose induced image under \\(P\\) is\n\\(\\{\\text{Caesar}, \\text{Aristotle}\\}\\). This is favorable to the\nproposal, for \u201cphilosopher\u201d is certainly not widely\napplicable, and so non-logical on most views. On the other hand, the\npredicate \u201care identical\u201d has as its extension over \\(D\\)\nthe set of pairs \n\n\\(\\{ \\langle \\text{Aristotle, Aristotle} \\rangle, \\langle\n\\text{Caesar, Caesar} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{Napoleon, Napoleon}\n\\rangle, \\langle \\text{Kripke, Kripke} \\rangle\\};\\)\n\n\nits induced image under \\(P\\), and under any other permutation of\n\\(D\\), is that very same set of pairs (as the reader may check); so\nagain this is favorable to the proposal. (Other paradigmatic logical\nexpressions receive more complicated extensions over domains, but the\nextensions they receive are invariant under permutations. For example,\non one usual way of understanding the extension of \u201cand\u201d\nover a domain, this is the function that assigns, to each pair\n\\(\\langle S_1, S_2 \\rangle\\), where \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) are sets of\ninfinite sequences of objects drawn from \\(D\\), the intersection of\n\\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\); and this function is permutation invariant.) One\nproblem with the proposal is that many expressions that seem clearly\nnon-logical, because they are not widely applicable, are nevertheless\ninvariant under permutations, and thus unable to distinguish different\nindividuals. The simplest examples are perhaps non-logical predicates\nthat have an empty extension over any domain, and hence have empty\ninduced images as well. \u201cMale widow\u201d is one example;\nversions of it can be used as counterexamples to the different\nversions of the idea of logicality as permutation invariance (see\nG\u00f3mez-Torrente 2002), and it's unclear that the proponent of\nthe idea can avoid the problem in any non ad hoc way.\n\nAnother popular recent way of delineating the Aristotelian intuition\nof the semantic \u201cinsubstantiality\u201d of logical expressions\nappeals to the concept of \u201cpure inferentiality\u201d. The idea\nis that logical expressions are those whose meaning, in some sense, is\ngiven by \u201cpurely inferential\u201d rules. (See Kneale 1956,\nHacking 1979, Peacocke 1987, Hodes 2004, among others.) A necessary\nproperty of purely inferential rules is that they regulate only\ninferential transitions between verbal items, not between extra-verbal\nassertibility conditions and verbal items, or between verbal items and\nactions licensed by those items. A certain inferential rule licenses\nyou to say \u201cIt rains\u201d when it rains, but it's not\n\u201cpurely inferential\u201d. A rule that licenses you to say\n\u201cA is a female whose husband died before her\u201d when someone\nsays \u201cA is a widow\u201d, however, is not immediately\ndisqualified as purely inferential. Now, presumably in some sense the\nmeaning of \u201cwidow\u201d is given by this last rule together\nperhaps with the converse rule, that licenses you to say \u201cA is a\nwidow\u201d when someone says \u201cA is a female whose husband died\nbefore her\u201d. But \u201cwidow\u201d is not a logical\nexpression, since it's not widely applicable; so one needs to\npostulate more necessary properties that \u201cpurely\ninferential\u201d rules ought to satisfy. A number of such conditions\nare postulated in the relevant literature (see e.g. Belnap 1962 (a\nreply to Prior 1960), Hacking 1979 and Hodes 2004). However, even when\nthe notion of pure inferentiality is strengthened in these ways,\nproblems remain. Most often the proposal is that an expression is\nlogical just in case certain purely inferential rules give its whole\nmeaning, including its sense, or the set of aspects of its use that\nneed to be mastered in order to understand it (as in Kneale 1956,\nPeacocke 1987 and Hodes 2004). However, it seems clear that some\nparadigmatic logical expressions have extra sense attached to them\nthat is not codifiable purely inferentially. For example, inductive\nreasoning involving \u201call\u201d seems to be part of the sense of\nthis expression, but it's hard to see how it could be codified by\npurely inferential rules (as noted by Sainsbury 1991, pp. 316\u20137;\nsee also Dummett 1991, ch. 12). A different version of the proposal\nconsists in saying that an expression is logical just in case certain\npurely inferential rules that are part of its sense suffice to\ndetermine its extension (as in Hacking 1979). But it seems clear that\nif the extension of, say, \u201care identical\u201d is determined by\na certain set of purely inferential rules that are part of its sense,\nthen the extension of \u201care identical and are not male\nwidows\u201d is equally determined by the same rules, which arguably\nform part of its sense; yet \u201care identical and are not male\nwidows\u201d is not a logical expression (see G\u00f3mez-Torrente\n2002).\n\nIn view of problems of these and other sorts, some philosophers have\nproposed that the concept of a logical expression is not associated\nwith necessary and sufficient conditions, but only with some necessary\ncondition related to the condition of wide applicability, such as the\ncondition of \u201cbeing very relevant for the systematization of\nscientific reasoning\u201d (see Warmbro\u0304d 1999 for a position of\nthis type). Others (G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2021) have proposed that\nthere may be a set of necessary and sufficient conditions, if these\nare not much related to the idea of semantic\n\u201cinsubstantiality\u201d and are instead pragmatic and suitably\nvague; for example, many expressions are excluded directly by the\ncondition of wide applicability; and prepositions are presumably\nexcluded by some such implicit condition as \u201ca logical\nexpression must be one whose study is useful for the resolution of\nsignificant problems and fallacies in reasoning\u201d. To be sure,\nthese proposals give up on the extended intuition of semantic\n\u201cinsubstantiality\u201d, and may be somewhat unsatisfactory for\nthat reason.\n\nSome philosophers have reacted even more radically to the problems of\nusual characterizations, claiming that the distinction between logical\nand non-logical expressions must be vacuous, and thus rejecting the\nnotion of logical form altogether. (See e.g. Orayen 1989, ch. 4,\n\u00a72.2; Etchemendy 1990, ch. 9; Read 1994; Priest 2001.) These\nphilosophers typically think of logical truth as a notion roughly\nequivalent to that of analytic truth simpliciter. But they\nare even more liable to the charge of giving up on extended intuitions\nthan the proposals of the previous paragraph.\n\nFor more thorough treatments of the ideas of formality and of a\nlogical expression see the entry\n logical constants,\n and MacFarlane 2000.\n2. The Mathematical Characterization of Logical Truth\n2.1 Formalization\n\nOne important reason for the successes of modern logic is its use of\nwhat has been called \u201cformalization\u201d. This term is usually\nemployed to cover several distinct (though related) phenomena, all of\nthem present in Frege (1879). One of these is the use of a completely\nspecified set of artificial symbols to which the logician assigns\nunambiguous meanings, related to the meanings of corresponding natural\nlanguage expressions, but much more clearly delimited and stripped\nfrom the notes that in those natural language expressions seem (to the\nlogician) irrelevant to truth-conditional content; this is especially\ntrue of symbols meant to represent the logical expressions of natural\nlanguage. Another phenomenon is the stipulation of a completely\nprecise grammar for the formulae construed out of the artificial\nsymbols, formulae that will be \u201cstripped\u201d versions of\ncorrelate sentences in natural language; this grammar amounts to an\nalgorithm for producing formulae starting from the basic symbols. A\nthird phenomenon is the postulation of a deductive calculus with a\nvery clear specification of axioms and rules of inference for the\nartificial formulae (see the next section); such a calculus is\nintended to represent in some way deductive reasoning with the\ncorrelates of the formulae, but unlike ordinary deductions,\nderivations in the calculus contain no steps that are not definite\napplications of the specified rules of inference.\n\nInstead of attempting to characterize the logical truths of a natural\nlanguage like English, the Fregean logician attempts to characterize\nthe artificial formulae that are \u201cstripped\u201d correlates of\nthose logical truths in a Fregean formalized language. In first-order\nFregean formalized languages, among these formulae one finds\nartificial correlates of (1), (2) and (3), things like\n\n \n\\(((\\text{Bad}(\\textit{death}) \\rightarrow \\text{Good}(\\textit{life}))\n\\ \\& \\ \\text{Bad}(\\textit{death})) \\rightarrow\n\\text{Good}(\\textit{life}).\\) \n\n\n  \\((\\forall\nx(\\text{Desire}(x) \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Voluntary}(x)) \\ \\&\\\n\\exists x(\\text{Belief}(x) \\ \\&\\ \\text{Desire}(x)))\\)\n\n\u00a0 \\(\\rightarrow \\exists x(\\text{Belief}(x) \\ \\&\\ \\neg\n\\text{Voluntary}(x)).\\) \n\n\n \n\\((\\text{Cat}(\\textit{drasha}) \\ \\&\\ \\forall x(\\text{Cat}(x)\n\\rightarrow \\text{Mysterious}(x)))\\)\n\n\u00a0 \\(\\rightarrow \\text{Mysterious}(\\textit{drasha}).\\)\n\n\n\n(See the entry on\n logic, classical.)\n Fregean formalized languages include also classical higher-order\nlanguages. (See the entry on\n logic, second-order and higher-order.)\n The logical expressions in these languages are standardly taken to be\nthe symbols for the truth-functions, the quantifiers, identity and\nother symbols definable in terms of those (but there are dissenting\nviews on the status of the higher-order quantifiers; see 2.4.3\nbelow).\n\nThe restriction to artificial formulae raises a number of questions\nabout the exact value of the Fregean enterprise for the demarcation of\nlogical truths in natural language; much of this value depends on how\nmany and how important are perceived to be the notes stripped from the\nnatural language expressions that are correlates of the standard\nlogical expressions of formalized languages. But whatever one's view\nof the exact value of formalization, there is little doubt that it has\nbeen very illuminating for logical purposes. One reason is that it's\nsometimes relatively clear that the stripped notes are irrelevant to\ntruth-conditional content (this is especially true of the use of\nnatural language logical expressions for doing mathematics). Another\nof the reasons is that the fact that the grammar and meaning of the\nartificial formulae is so well delimited has permitted the development\nof proposed characterizations of logical truth that use only concepts\nof standard mathematics. This in turn has allowed the study of the\ncharacterized notions by means of standard mathematical techniques.\nThe next two sections describe the two main approaches to\ncharacterization in broad\n outline.[7]\n2.2 Derivability\n\nWe just noted that the Fregean logician's formalized grammar amounts\nto an algorithm for producing formulae from the basic artificial\nsymbols. This is meant very literally. As was clear to mathematical\nlogicians from very early on, the basic symbols can be seen as (or\ncodified by) natural numbers, and the formation rules in the\nartificial grammar can be seen as (or codified by) simple computable\narithmetical operations. The grammatical formulae can then be seen as\n(or codified by) the numbers obtainable from the basic numbers after\nsome finite series of applications of the operations, and thus their\nset is characterizable in terms of concepts of arithmetic and set\ntheory (in fact arithmetic suffices, with the help of some\ntricks).\n\nExactly the same is true of the set of formulae that are derivable in\na formalized deductive calculus. A formula \\(F\\) is derivable in a\nFregean calculus \\(C\\) just in case \\(F\\) is obtainable from the\naxioms of \\(C\\) after some finite series of applications of the rules\nof inference of \\(C\\). But the axioms are certain formulae built by\nthe process of grammatical formation, so they can be seen as (or\ncodified by) certain numbers; and the rules of inference can again be\nseen as (or codified by) certain computable arithmetical operations.\nSo the derivable formulae can be seen as (or codified by) the numbers\nobtainable from the axiom numbers after some finite series of\napplications of the inference operations, and thus their set is again\ncharacterizable in terms of concepts of standard mathematics (again\narithmetic suffices).\n\nIn the time following Frege's revolution, there appears to have been a\nwidespread belief that the set of logical truths of any Fregean\nlanguage could be characterized as the set of formulae derivable in\nsome suitably chosen calculus (hence, essentially, as the set of\nnumbers obtainable by certain arithmetical operations). Frege himself\nsays, speaking of the higher-order language in his\n\u201cBegriffsschrift\u201d, that through formalization (in the\nthird sense above) \u201cwe arrive at a small number of laws in\nwhich, if we add those contained in the rules, the content of all the\nlaws is included, albeit in an undeveloped state\u201d (Frege 1879,\n\u00a713). The idea follows straightforwardly from Russell's\nconception of mathematics and logic as identical (see Russell 1903,\nch. I, \u00a710; Russell 1920, pp. 194\u20135) and his thesis that\n\u201cby the help of ten principles of deduction and ten other\npremises of a general logical nature (\u2026), all mathematics can\nbe strictly and formally deduced\u201d (Russell 1903, ch. I,\n\u00a74). See also Bernays (1930, p. 239): \u201c[through\nformalization] it becomes evident that all logical inference\n(\u2026) can be reduced to a limited number of logical elementary\nprocesses that can be exactly and completely enumerated\u201d. In the\nopening paragraphs of his paper on logical consequence, Tarski (1936a,\n1936b) says that the belief was prevalent before the appearance of\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems (see subsection 2.4.3 below for\nthe bearing of these theorems on this issue). In recent times,\napparently due to the influence of Tarskian arguments such as the one\nmentioned towards the end of subsection 2.4.3, the belief in the\nadequacy of derivability characterizations seems to have waned (see\ne.g. Prawitz 1985 for a similar appraisal).\n2.3 Model-theoretic Validity\n\nEven on the most cautious way of understanding the modality present in\nlogical truths, a sentence is a logical truth only if no sentence\nwhich is a replacement instance of its logical form is false. (This\nidea is only rejected by those who reject the notion of logical form.)\nIt is a common observation that this property, even if it is\nnecessary, is not clearly sufficient for a sentence to be a logical\ntruth. Perhaps there is a sentence that has this property but is not\nreally logically true, because one could assign some unexpressed\nmeanings to the variables and the schematic letters in its\nlogical form, and under those meanings the form would be a false\n sentence.[8]\n On the other hand, it is not clearly incorrect to think that a\nsentence is a logical truth if no collective assignment of meanings to\nthe variables and the schematic letters in its logical form would turn\nthis form into a false sentence. Say that a sentence is\nuniversally valid when it has this property. A standard\napproach to the mathematical characterization of logical truth,\nalternative to the derivability approach, uses always some version of\nthe property of universal validity, proposing it in each case as both\nnecessary and sufficient for logical truth. Note that if a sentence is\nuniversally valid then, even if it's not logically true, it will be\ntrue. So all universally valid sentences are correct at least\nin this sense.\n\nApparently, the first to use a version of universal validity and\nexplicitly propose it as both necessary and sufficient for logical\ntruth was Bolzano (see Bolzano 1837, \u00a7148; and Coffa 1991, pp.\n33\u20134 for the claim of priority). The idea is also present in\nother mathematicians of the nineteenth century (see e.g. Jan\u00e9\n2006), and was common in Hilbert's school. Tarski (1936a, 1936b) was\nthe first to indicate in a fully explicit way how the version of\nuniversal validity used by the mathematicians could itself be given a\ncharacterization in terms of concepts of standard mathematics, in the\ncase of Fregean formalized languages with an algorithmic grammar.\nEssentially Tarski's characterization is widely used today in the form\nof what is known as the model-theoretic notion of validity,\nand it seems fair to say that it is usually accepted that this notion\ngives a reasonably good delineation of the set of logical truths for\nFregean languages.\n\nThe notion of model-theoretic validity mimics the notion of universal\nvalidity, but is defined just with the help of the set-theoretic\napparatus developed by Tarski (1935) for the characterization of\nsemantic concepts such as satisfaction, definability, and truth. (See\nthe entry on\n Tarski's truth definitions.)\n Given a Fregean language, a structure for the language is a\nset-theoretical object composed of a set-domain taken together with an\nassignment of extensions drawn from that domain to its non-logical\nconstants. A structure is meant by most logicians to represent an\nassignment of meanings: its domain gives the range or\n\u201cmeaning\u201d of the first-order variables (and induces ranges\nof the higher-order variables), and the extensions that the structure\nassigns to the non-logical constants are \u201cmeanings\u201d that\nthese expressions could take. Using the Tarskian apparatus, one\ndefines for the formulae of the Fregean language the notion of truth\nin (or satisfaction by) a set-theoretic structure (with respect to an\ninfinite sequence assigning an object of the domain to each variable).\nAnd finally, one defines a formula to be model-theoretically valid\njust in case it is true in all structures for its language (with\nrespect to all infinite sequences). Let's abbreviate \u201c\\(F\\) is\ntrue in all structures\u201d as \u201cMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d. The\nmodel-theoretic characterization makes it clear that\n\u201cMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d is definable purely in terms of concepts\nof set theory. (The notion of model-theoretic validity for Fregean\nlanguages is explained in thorough detail in the entries on\n classical logic\n and\n second-order and higher-order logic;\n see also the entry on\n model theory.)[9]\n\n(If \\(F\\) is a formula of a first-order language without identity,\nthen if no replacement instance of the form of \\(F\\) is false, this is\na sufficient condition for \\(F\\)'s being model-theoretically valid. As\nit turns out, if \\(F\\) is not model-theoretically valid, then some\nreplacement instance of its form whose variables range over the\nnatural numbers and whose non-logical constants are arithmetical\nexpressions will be false. This can be justified by means of a\nrefinement of the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem. See the entry on\n logic, classical,\n and Quine 1970, ch. 4, for discussion and references. No similar\nresults hold for higher-order languages.)\n\nThe \u201cMT\u201d in \u201cMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d stresses the fact\nthat model-theoretic validity is different from universal validity.\nThe notion of a meaning assignment which appears in the description of\nuniversal validity is a very imprecise and intuitive notion, while the\nnotion of a structure appearing in a characterization of\nmodel-theoretic validity is a fairly precise and technical one. It\nseems clear that the notion of a structure for Fregean formalized\nlanguages is minimally reasonable, in the sense that a structure\nmodels the power of one or several meaning assignments to make false\n(the logical form of) some sentence. As we will mention later, the\nconverse property, that each meaning assignment's validity-refuting\npower is modeled by some structure, is also a natural but more\ndemanding requirement on a notion of structure.\n2.4 The Problem of Adequacy\n\nThe fact that the notions of derivability and model-theoretic validity\nare definable in standard mathematics seems to have been a very\nattractive feature of them among practicing logicians. But this\nattractive feature of course does not justify by itself taking either\nnotion as an adequate characterization of logical truth. On most\nviews, with a mathematical characterization of logical truth we\nattempt to delineate a set of formulae possessing a number of\nnon-mathematical properties. Which properties these are varies\ndepending on our pretheoretic conception of, for example, the features\nof modality and formality. (By \u201cpretheoretic\u201d it's not\nmeant \u201cprevious to any theoretical activity\u201d; there could\nhardly be a \u201cpretheoretic\u201d conception of logical truth in\nthis sense. In this context what's meant is \u201cprevious to the\ntheoretical activity of mathematical characterization\u201d.) But on\nany such conception there will be external, non-mathematical criteria\nthat can be applied to evaluate the question whether a mathematical\ncharacterization is adequate. In this last section we will outline\nsome of the basic issues and results on the question whether\nderivability and model-theoretic validity are adequate in this\nsense.\n2.4.1 Analysis and Modality\n\nOne frequent objection to the adequacy of model-theoretic validity is\nthat it does not provide a conceptual analysis of the notion of\nlogical truth, even for sentences of Fregean formalized languages (see\ne.g. Pap 1958, p. 159; Kneale and Kneale 1962, p. 642; Field 1989, pp.\n33\u20134; Etchemendy 1990, ch. 7). This complaint is especially\ncommon among authors who feel inclined to identify logical truth and\nanalyticity simpliciter (see e.g. Kneale and Kneale,\nibid., Etchemendy 1990, p. 126). If one thinks of the concept\nof logical truth simply as the concept of analytic truth, it is\nespecially reasonable to accept that the concept of logical truth does\nnot have much to do with the concept of model-theoretic validity, for\npresumably this concept does not have much to do with the concept of\nanalyticity. To say that a formula is model-theoretically valid means\nthat there are no set-theoretic structures in which it is false;\nhence, to say that a formula is not model-theoretically valid means\nthat there are set-theoretic structures in which it is false. But to\nsay that a sentence is or is not analytic presumably does not mean\nanything about the existence or non-existence of set-theoretic\nstructures. Note that we could object to derivability on the same\ngrounds, for to say that a sentence is or is not analytic presumably\ndoes not mean anything about its being or not being the product of a\ncertain algorithm (compare Etchemendy 1990, p. 3). (One further\npeculiar, much debated claim in Etchemendy 1990 is that true claims of\nthe form \u201c\\(F\\) is logically true\u201d or \u201c\\(F\\) is not\nlogically true\u201d should themselves be logical truths (while the\ncorresponding claims \u201cMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d and \u201cNot\nMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d are not logical truths). Etchemendy's claim is\nperhaps defensible under a conception of logical truth as analyticity\nsimpliciter, but certainly doubtful on more traditional\nconceptions of logical truth, on which the predicate \u201cis a\nlogical truth\u201d is not even a logical expression. See\nG\u00f3mez-Torrente 1998/9 and Soames 1999, ch. 4 for\ndiscussion.)\n\nAnalogous \u201cno conceptual analysis\u201d objections can be made\nif we accept that the concept of logical truth has some other strong\nmodal notes unrelated to analyticity; for example, if we accept that\nit is part of the concept of logical truth that logical truths are\ntrue in all counterfactual circumstances, or necessary in some other\nstrong sense. Sher (1996) accepts something like the requirement that\na good characterization of logical truth should be given in terms of a\nmodally rich concept. However, she argues that the notion of\nmodel-theoretic validity is strongly modal, and so the \u201cno\nconceptual analysis\u201d objection is actually wrong: to say that a\nformula is or is not model-theoretically valid is to make a\nmathematical existence or non-existence claim, and according to Sher\nthese claims are best read as claims about the possibility and\nnecessity of structures. (Shalkowski 2004 argues that Sher's defense\nof model-theoretic validity is insufficient, on the basis of a certain\nmetaphysical conception of logical necessity. Etchemendy 2008\nrelatedly argues that Sher's defense is based on inadequate\nrestrictions on the modality relevant to logical truth. See also the\ncritical discussion of Sher in Hanson 1997.) Garc\u00eda-Carpintero\n(1993) offers a view related to Sher's: model-theoretic validity\nprovides a (correct) conceptual analysis of logical truth for Fregean\nlanguages, because the notion of a set-theoretical structure is in\nfact a subtle refinement of the modal notion of a possible meaning\nassignment. Azzouni (2006), ch. 9, also defends the view that\nmodel-theoretic validity provides a correct conceptual analysis of\nlogical truth (though restricted to first-order languages), on the\nbasis of a certain deflationist conception of the (strong) modality\ninvolved in logical truth.\n\nThe standard view of set-theoretic claims, however, does not see them\nas strong modal claims\u2014at best, some of them are modal in the\nminimal sense that they are universal generalizations or particular\ncases of these. But it is at any rate unclear that this is the basis\nfor a powerful objection to model-theoretic validity or to\nderivability, for, even if we accept that the concept of logical truth\nis strongly modal, it is unclear that a good characterization of\nlogical truth ought to be a conceptual analysis. An analogy might\nhelp. It is widely agreed that the characterizations of the notion of\ncomputability in standard mathematics, e.g. as recursiveness, are in\nsome sense good characterizations. Note that the concept of\ncomputability is modal, in a moderately strong sense; it\nseems to be about what beings like us could do with certain symbols if\nthey were free from certain limitations\u2014not about, say, what\nexisting beings have done or will do. However, to say that a certain\nfunction is recursive is not to make a modal claim about it, but a\ncertain purely arithmetical claim. So recursiveness is widely agreed\nto provide a good characterization of computability, but it clearly\ndoes not provide a conceptual analysis. Perhaps it could be argued\nthat the situation with model-theoretic validity, or derivability, or\nboth, is the same.\n\nA number of philosophers explicitly reject the requirement that a good\ncharacterization of logical truth should provide a conceptual\nanalysis, and (at least for the sake of argument) do not question the\nusual view of set-theoretic claims as non-modal, but have argued that\nthe universe of set-theoretic structures somehow models the universe\nof possible structures (or at least the universe of possible\nset-theoretic structures; see McGee 1992, Shapiro 1998, Sagi 2014). In\nthis indirect sense, the characterization in terms of model-theoretic\nvalidity would grasp part of the strong modal force that logical\ntruths are often perceived to possess. McGee (1992) gives an elegant\nargument for this idea: it is reasonable to think that given any\nset-theoretic structure, even one construed out of non-mathematical\nindividuals, actualized or not, there is a set-theoretic structure\nisomorphic to it but construed exclusively out of pure sets; but any\nsuch pure set-theoretic structure is, on the usual view, an actualized\nexistent; so every possible set-theoretic structure is modeled by a\nset-theoretic structure, as desired. (The significance of this relies\non the fact that in Fregean languages a formula is true in a structure\nif and only if it is true in all the structures isomorphic to it.)\n\nBut model-theoretic validity (or derivability) might be theoretically\nadequate in some way even if some possible meaning-assignments are not\nmodeled straightforwardly by (actual) set-theoretic structures. For\nmodel-theoretic validity to be theoretically adequate, it might be\nheld, it is enough if we have other reasons to think that it is\nextensionally adequate, i.e. that it coincides in extension with our\npreferred pretheoretic notion of logical truth. In subsections 2.4.2\nand 2.4.3 we will examine some existing arguments for and against the\nplain extensional adequacy of derivability and model-theoretic\nvalidity for Fregean languages.\n2.4.2 Extensional Adequacy: A General Argument\n\nIf one builds one's deductive calculus with care, one will be able to\nconvince oneself that all the formulae derivable in the calculus are\nlogical truths. The reason is that one can have used one's intuition\nvery systematically to obtain that conviction: one can have included\nin one's calculus only axioms of which one is convinced that they are\nlogical truths; and one can have included as rules of inference rules\nof which one is convinced that they produce logical truths when\napplied to logical truths. Using another terminology, this means that,\nif one builds one's calculus with care, one will be convinced that the\nderivability characterization of logical truth for formulae of the\nformalized language will be sound with respect to logical\ntruth.\n\nIt is equally obvious that if one has at hand a notion of\nmodel-theoretic validity for a formalized language which is based on a\nminimally reasonable notion of structure, then all logical truths (of\nthat language) will be model-theoretically valid. The reason is\nsimple: if a formula is not model-theoretically valid then there is a\nstructure in which it is false; but this structure must then model a\nmeaning assignment (or assignments) on which the formula (or its\nlogical form) is false; so it will be possible to construct a formula\nwith the same logical form, whose non-logical expressions have, by\nstipulation, the particular meanings drawn from that collective\nmeaning assignment, and which is therefore false. But then the idea of\nformality and the weakest conception of the modal force of logical\ntruths uncontroversially imply that the original formula is not\nlogically true. Using another terminology, we can conclude that\nmodel-theoretic validity is complete with respect to logical\ntruth.\n\nLet's abbreviate \u201c\\(F\\) is derivable in calculus \\(C\\)\u201d by\n\u201cDC\\((F)\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(F\\) is a logical truth (in our\npreferred pretheoretical sense)\u201d by \u201cLT\\((F)\\)\u201d.\nThen, if \\(C\\) is a calculus built to suit our pretheoretic conception\nof logical truth, the situation can be summarized thus:\n\n(4)  \\(\\text{DC}(F)\n\\Rightarrow \\text{LT}(F) \\Rightarrow \\text{MTValid}(F).\\) \n\n\nThe first implication is the soundness of derivability; the second is\nthe completeness of model-theoretic validity.\n\nIn order to convince ourselves that the characterizations of logical\ntruth in terms of DC\\((F)\\) and MTValid\\((F)\\) are extensionally\nadequate we should convince ourselves that the converse implications\nhold too:\n\n(5) \n\\(\\text{MTValid}(F) \\Rightarrow \\text{LT}(F) \\Rightarrow\n\\text{DC}(F).\\) \n\n\nObtaining this conviction, or the conviction that these implications\ndon't in fact hold, turns out to be difficult in general. But a remark\nof Kreisel (1967) establishes that a conviction that they hold can be\nobtained sometimes. In some cases it is possible to give a\nmathematical proof that derivability (in some specified calculus\n\\(C\\)) is complete with respect to model-theoretic validity, i.e. a\nproof of\n\n(6) \n\\(\\text{MTValid}(F) \\Rightarrow \\text{DC}(F).\\) \n\n\nKreisel called attention to the fact that (6) together with (4)\nimplies that model-theoretic validity is sound with respect to logical\ntruth, i.e., that the first implication of (5) holds. (Strictly\nspeaking, this is a strong generalization of Kreisel's remark, which\nin place of \u201c\\(\\text{LT}(F)\\)\u201d had something like\n\u201c\\(F\\) is true in all class structures\u201d\n(structures with a class, possibly proper, as domain of the individual\nvariables).) This means that when (6) holds the notion of\nmodel-theoretic validity offers an extensionally correct\ncharacterization of logical truth. (See Etchemendy 1990, ch. 11,\nHanson 1997, G\u00f3mez-Torrente 1998/9, and Field 2008, ch. 2, for\nversions of this observation, and Smith 2011 and Griffiths 2014 for\nobjections.) Also, (6), together with (4), implies that the notion of\nderivability is complete with respect to logical truth (the second\nimplication in (5)) and hence offers an extensionally correct\ncharacterization of this notion. Note that this reasoning is very\ngeneral and independent of what our particular pretheoretic conception\nof logical truth is.\n\nAn especially significant case in which this reasoning can be applied\nis the case of standard Fregean first-order quantificational\nlanguages, under a wide array of pretheoretic conceptions of logical\ntruth. It is typical to accept that all formulae derivable in a\ntypical first-order calculus are universally valid, true in all\ncounterfactual circumstances, a priori and analytic if any\nformula\n is.[10]\n So (4) holds under a wide array of pretheoretic conceptions in this\ncase. (6) holds too for the typical calculi in question, in virtue of\nG\u00f6del's completeness theorem, so (5) holds. This means that one\ncan convince oneself that both derivability and model-theoretic\nvalidity are extensionally correct characterizations of our favorite\npretheoretic notion of logical truth for first-order languages, if our\npretheoretic conception is not too eccentric. The situation is not so\nclear in other languages of special importance for the Fregean\ntradition, the higher-order quantificational languages.\n2.4.3 Extensional Adequacy: Higher-order Languages\n\nIt follows from G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem that already\nfor a second-order language there is no calculus \\(C\\) where\nderivability is sound with respect to model-theoretic validity and\nwhich makes true (6) (for the notion of model-theoretic validity as\nusually defined for such a language). We may call this result the\nincompleteness of second-order calculi with respect to model-theoretic\nvalidity. Said another way: for every second-order calculus \\(C\\)\nsound with respect to model-theoretic validity there will be a formula\n\\(F\\) such that \\(\\text{MTValid}(F)\\) but it is not the case that\n\\(\\text{DC}(F)\\).\n\nIn this situation it's not possible to apply Kreisel's argument for\n(5). In fact, the incompleteness of second-order calculi shows that,\ngiven any calculus \\(C\\) satisfying (4), one of the implications of\n(5) is false (or both are): either derivability in\n\\(C\\) is incomplete with respect to logical truth or\nmodel-theoretic validity is unsound with respect to logical truth.\n\nDifferent authors have extracted opposed lessons from incompleteness.\nA common reaction is to think that model-theoretic validity must be\nunsound with respect to logical truth. This is especially frequent in\nphilosophers on whose conception logical truths must be a\npriori or analytic. One idea is that the results of a\npriori reasoning or of analytic thinking ought to be codifiable\nin a calculus. (See e.g. Wagner 1987, p. 8.) But even if we grant this\nidea, it's doubtful that the desired conclusion follows. Suppose that\n(i) every a priori or analytic reasoning must be reproducible\nin a calculus. We accept also, of course, that (ii) for every\ncalculus \\(C\\) sound with respect to model-theoretic validity\nthere is a model-theoretically valid formula that is not\nderivable in \\(C\\). From all this it doesn't follow that (iii)\nthere is a model-theoretically valid formula \\(F\\) such that\nfor every calculus \\(C\\) sound for model-theoretic validity\n\\(F\\) is not derivable in C. From (iii) and (i) it follows of\ncourse that there are model-theoretically valid formulae that are not\nobtainable by a priori or analytic reasoning. But the step\nfrom (ii) to (iii) is a typical quantificational fallacy. From (i) and\n(ii) it doesn't follow that there is any model-theoretically valid\nformula which is not obtainable by a priori or analytic\nreasoning. The only thing that follows (from (ii) alone under the\nassumptions that model-theoretic validity is sound with respect to\nlogical truth and that logical truths are a priori and\nanalytic) is that no calculus sound with respect to model-theoretic\nvalidity can by itself model all the a priori or\nanalytic reasonings that people are able to make. But it's not\nsufficiently clear that this should be intrinsically problematic.\nAfter all, a priori and analytic reasonings must start from\nbasic axioms and rules, and for all we know a reflective mind may have\nan inexhaustible ability to find new truths and truth-preserving rules\nby a priori or analytic consideration of even a meager stock\nof concepts. The claim that all analytic truths ought to be derivable\nin one single calculus is perhaps plausible on the view that\nanalyticity is to be explained by conventions or \u201ctacit\nagreements\u201d, for these agreements are presumably finite in\nnumber, and their implications are presumably at most effectively\nenumerable. But this view is just one problematic idea about how\napriority and analyticity should be explicated. (See also Etchemendy\n1990, chs. 8, 9, for an argument for the unsoundness of higher-order\nmodel-theoretic validity based on the conception of logical truth as\nanalyticity simpliciter, and G\u00f3mez-Torrente 1998/9,\nSoames 1999, ch. 4, Paseau 2014, Florio and Incurvati 2019, 2021, and\nGriffiths and Paseau 2022, ch. 9, for critical reactions.)\n\nAnother type of unsoundness arguments attempt to show that there is\nsome higher-order formula that is model-theoretically valid but is\nintuitively false in a structure whose domain is a proper class. (The\n\u201cintended interpretation\u201d of set theory, if it exists at\nall, might be one such structure, for it is certainly not a set; see\nthe entry on\n set theory.)\n These arguments thus question the claim that each meaning\nassignment's validity-refuting power is modeled by some set-theoretic\nstructure, a claim which is surely a corollary of the first\nimplication in (5). (In McGee 1992 there is a good example; there is\ncritical discussion in G\u00f3mez-Torrente 1998/9.) The most\nwidespread view among set theorists seems to be that there are no\nformulae with that property in Fregean languages, but it's certainly\nnot an absolutely firm belief of theirs. Note that these arguments\noffer a challenge only to the idea that universal validity (as defined\nin section 2.3) is adequately modeled by set-theoretic validity, not\nto the soundness of a characterization of logical truth in terms of\nuniversal validity itself, or in terms of a species of validity based\non some notion of \u201cmeaning assignment\u201d different from the\nusual notion of a set-theoretic structure. (The arguments we mentioned\nin the preceding paragraph and in 2.4.1 would have deeper implications\nif correct, for they easily imply challenges to all characterizations\nin terms of species of validity as well). In fact, worries of this\nkind have prompted the proposal of a different kind of notions of\nvalidity (for Fregean languages), in which set-theoretic structures\nare replaced with suitable values of higher-order variables in a\nhigher-order language for set theory, e.g. with \u201cplural\ninterpretations\u201d (see Boolos 1985, Rayo and Uzquiano 1999,\nWilliamson 2003, Florio and Incurvati 2021; see also Florio and\nLinnebo 2021 and the entry on\n plural quantification).\n Both set-theoretic and proper class structures are modeled by such\nvalues, so these particular worries of unsoundness do not affect this\nkind of proposals.\n\nIn general, there are no fully satisfactory philosophical arguments\nfor the thesis that model-theoretic validity is unsound with respect\nto logical truth in higher-order languages. Are there then any good\nreasons to think that derivability (in any calculus sound for\nmodel-theoretic validity) must be incomplete with respect to logical\ntruth? There don't seem to be any absolutely convincing reasons for\nthis view either. The main argument (the first version of which was\nperhaps first made explicit in Tarski 1936a, 1936b) seems to be this.\nAs noted above, G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem implies that\nfor any calculus for a higher-order language there will be a\nmodel-theoretically valid formula that will not be derivable in the\ncalculus. As it turns out, the formula obtained by the G\u00f6del\nconstruction is also always intuitively true in all domains\n(set-theoretical or not), and it's reasonable to think of it as\nuniversally valid. (It's certainly not a formula false in a proper\nclass structure.) The argument concludes that for any calculus there\nare logically true formulae that are not derivable in it.\n\nFrom this it has been concluded that derivability (in any calculus)\nmust be incomplete with respect to logical truth. But a fundamental\nproblem is that this conclusion is based on two assumptions that will\nnot necessarily be granted by the champion of derivability: first, the\nassumption that the expressions typically cataloged as logical in\nhigher-order languages, and in particular the quantifiers in\nquantifications of the form \\(\\forall X\\) (where \\(X\\) is a\nhigher-order variable), are in fact logical expressions; and second,\nthe assumption that being universally valid is a sufficient condition\nfor logical truth. On these assumptions it is certainly very\nreasonable to think that derivability, in any calculus satisfying (4),\nmust be incomplete with respect to logical truth. But in the absence\nof additional considerations, a critic may question the assumptions,\nand deny relevance to the argument. The second assumption would\nprobably be questioned e.g. from the point of view that logical truths\nmust be analytic, for there is no conclusive reason to think that\nuniversally valid formulae must be analytic. The first assumption\nactually underlies any conviction one may have that (4) holds for any\none particular higher-order calculus. (Note that if we denied that the\nhigher-order quantifiers are logical expressions we could equally deny\nthat the arguments presented above against the soundness of\nmodel-theoretic validity with respect to logical truth are\nrelevant at all.) That the higher-order quantifiers are logical has\noften been denied on the grounds that they are semantically too\n\u201csubstantive\u201d. It is often pointed out in this connection\nthat higher-order quantifications can be used to define sophisticated\nset-theoretic properties that one cannot define just with the help of\nfirst-order quantifiers. (Defenders of the logical status of\nhigher-order quantifications, on the other hand, point to the wide\napplicability of the higher-order quantifiers, to the fact that they\nare analogous to the first-order quantifiers, to the fact that they\nare typically needed to provide categorical axiomatizations of\nmathematical structures, etc. See Quine (1970), ch. 5, for the\nstandard exponent of the restrictive view, and Boolos (1975) and\nShapiro (1991) for standard exponents of the liberal view.) \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alexander of Aphrodisias, <em>In Aristotelis Analyticorum Priorum\nLibrum I Commentarium</em>, M.
