    "main_text": "The Dynamical Approach || Space-time and Explanation on the Dynamical Approach\n4.2 Space-time and Explanation on the Dynamical Approach\n\nWe have already seen how the dynamical approach, qua\nprogramme of ontological reduction, is supposed to play out in the\ncontext of theories with fixed spacetime structure, including both\nNewtonian theories and STR. We have also witnessed Brown and\nPooley\u2019s concerns about the ability of a substantival spacetime\nto explain facts about the behavior of matter. These concerns are\nmotivated by apparent problem cases, in which the symmetries of a\nsubstantival spacetime seem to come apart from those of the dynamical\nlaws governing matter. Such cases include: (i) Newtonian mechanics set\nin Newtonian spacetime (Read 2020a); (ii) the Jacobson-Mattingly\ntheory (Jacobson & Mattingly 2001), in which dynamical symmetries\nare a subset of spacetime symmetries, as a result of the presence of\nan additional (dynamical) symmetry-breaking vector field (Read, Brown\n& Lehmkuhl 2018).\n\nIt is not obvious that these critiques are fair to proponents of a\ngeometrical view. One might take their position not to be that a\ncertain piece of geometrical structure (e.g., the Minkowski metric of\nSTR) invariably constrains matter, whenever it is present in a theory,\nto manifest its symmetries (a claim which seems to be false, in light\nof the above cases). Instead, one might take their claim to be\nconditional: if one has matter which couples to this piece of\ngeometrical structure in such-and-such a way, then that\ngeometrical structure can explain why the laws have the such-and-such\nsymmetries. In (Read, 2020a), the (arguably) straw man version of a\ngeometrical view critiqued by Brown and Pooley is dubbed the\n\u2018unqualified geometrical approach\u2019, in contrast with this\nmore nuanced and defensible version of the view, which is dubbed the\n\u2018qualified geometrical approach\u2019. (Brown might still\nreject the qualified geometrical approach on the grounds that it makes\nexplanatory appeal to objects which violate the \u2018action-reaction\nprinciple\u2019, which states that every entity physical should both\nact on, and react to, other physical entities (Brown 2005, p. 140). If\nso, that this is the real reason for the rejection deserves to be\nflagged; moreover, it remains open whether the objection succeeds\nagainst the non-substantivalist versions of the geometrical view which\nare discussed below.)\n\nFocussing on the qualified geometrical approach, there are also\nquestions regarding the particular sense in which spacetime structure\ncan be said to be explanatory of dynamical symmetries. One notion of\nexplanation discussed in this literature is that of a\n\u2018constructive explanation\u2019.This is derivative on\nEinstein\u2019s distinction between \u2018principle theories\u2019\nand \u2018constructive theories\u2019 (Einstein 1919): for detailed\ndiscussion, see (Brown 2005, \u00a75.2). In brief, a constructive\nexplanation is one in which phenomenological effects are explained by\nreference to real (but possibly unobservable) physical bodies. (For\nfurther discussion of how to understand constructive theories and\nexplanations, see (Frisch 2011).) With the idea of a constructive\nexplanation in mind, one can say this: if a proponent of a geometrical\nview hypostatizes spacetime, then they can give constructive\nexplanations of certain physical effects by appeal to that spacetime\nstructure; otherwise, they cannot. That said, even if one does not\nhypostatise spacetime, and so concedes that spacetime cannot offer\nconstructive explanations of the behaviour of matter, it is not\nobvious that spacetime cannot still facilitate other kinds of\nexplanation. For discussions of these issues, see (Acu\u00f1a 2016;\nDorato & Felline 2010; Frisch 2011; Read 2020b).\n",
