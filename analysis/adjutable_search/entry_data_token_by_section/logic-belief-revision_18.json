    "main_text": "Other operations || Replacement\n6.6 Replacement\n\nBy replacement is meant an operation that replaces one sentence by\nanother in a belief set. It is an operation with two variables, such\nthat \\([p/q]\\) replaces \\(p\\) by \\(q\\). Hence, \\(K[p/q]\\) is a belief\nset that contains \\(q\\) but not \\(p\\).\n\nReplacement aims both at the removal of a sentence \\(p\\) and the\naddition of a sentence \\(q\\). This amounts to two success conditions,\n\\(p \\not\\in K[p/q]\\) and \\(q \\in K[p/q]\\). However, these two\nconditions cannot both be satisfied without exception. First, just as\nfor belief contraction, an exception must be made from the first of\nthem in the case when \\(p\\) is a tautology and so cannot be removed.\nSecondly, the two conditions are not compatible in cases when \\(q\\)\nlogically implies \\(p\\). This can be dealt with by extending the\nexception that is provided for in the Success postulate for\ncontraction from cases when \\(p \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\) to cases when\n\\(p \\in \\Cn(\\{q\\})\\). This gives rise to the following two success\nconditions:\n\n\nContractive success:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\{q\\})\\), then \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K[p/q]\\)).\n\nRevision success:\n\n\\(q \\in K[p/q]\\)\n\n\nReplacement can be used as a kind of \u201cSheffer stroke\u201d for\nbelief revision, i.e. as an operation in terms of which the other\noperations can be defined. Contraction by \\(p\\) can be defined as\n\\(K[p/\\smtop]\\) and revision by \\(p\\) as \\(K[\\smbot/p]\\), where\n\\(\\smbot\\) is falsum and \\(\\smtop\\) is tautology. Provided that the\nunperformable suboperation of removing the tautology \\(\\smtop\\) is\ntreated as an empty suboperation, expansion by \\(p\\) can be defined as\n\\(K[\\smtop/p]\\).\n",
