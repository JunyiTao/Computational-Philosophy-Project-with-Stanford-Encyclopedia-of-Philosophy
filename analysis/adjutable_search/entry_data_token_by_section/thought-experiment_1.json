    "main_text": "Taxonomies of Thought Experiments\n2. Taxonomies of Thought Experiments\n\nMany taxonomies can be found in the literature. They are not mutually\nexclusive. We will present three of them. The first follows the type\nof purpose thought experiments serve. A very rudimentary version of it\ncan be found in Mach (1897 and 1905). Such a classification makes\nsense, because an \u201cimaginary experiment should be judged on its\nspecific purpose\u201d (Krimsky 1973, p. 331). Thought experiments\nare conducted for diverse reasons (see, e.g., DeMay 2006; Sorensen\n1992, pp. 7\u201315), and this in a variety of areas, including\neconomics (see, e.g., Herfeld 2019; Thoma 2016), education (Helm and\nGilbert 1985; Helm et al. 1985, Klassen 2006; Sriraman 2006; Stonier\n1990), history (see, e.g., Maar 2014; Reiss 2009), literature (see,\ne.g., Davies 2007; Elgin 2004), mathematics (see, e.g. Brown 1991\n[2011], pp. 90\u201397; Glas 1999), morality (see, e.g., Hauerwas\n1996; Wilson 2016), as well as the natural sciences (see Krimsky\n1973), the socio-political realm (see, e.g. Roberts 1993: Thaler\n2016), and theology (see, e.g., Gregersen 2014; Fehige 2024). Thought\nexperiments may be used to entertain. This is probably true of short\nstories or novels which some argue qualify as thought experiments if\ncertain conditions apply (see, e.g., Davenport 1983). Some thought\nexperiments fulfil a specific function within a theory (see Borsboom\net al. 2002). Others are executed because it is impossible to run the\nexperimental scenario in the real world (see, e.g., Sorensen 1992, pp.\n200\u2013202). Sometimes thought experiments help to illustrate and\nclarify very abstract states of affairs, thereby accelerating the\nprocess of understanding (see Behmel 2001). Again others serve as\nexamples in conceptual analysis (see Cohnitz 2006). And, then there\nare those that matter in the process of theory discovery (Praem and\nSteglich\u2013Peterson 2015). The thought experiments that have\nreceived most of the attention are taken to provide evidence for or\nagainst a theory, putting them on a par with real-world experiments\n(see, e.g., Gendler 2004). The different ways to use thought\nexperiments, of course, do not exclude one another. Most obviously,\nfor example, a thought experiment can both entertain and make a case\nagainst a theory.\n\nA second taxonomy classifies thought experiments in terms of their\nlogical structure (see Sorensen 1992, pp. 132\u2013166). The idea is\nto divide all thought experiments into two types of \u201calethic\nrefuters\u201d: \u201cAlthough there are a number of ways to\nclassify thought experiments, a refutation format scores the most\npoints when judged by familiarity, specificity, and simplicity.\nAccording to this scheme, thought experiments aim at overturning\nstatements by disproving one of their modal consequences. Modalities\nare operators that are applied to propositions to yield new\npropositions. There are deontic modalities (permissible,\nforbidden), epistemic modalities (know, believe), and\nalethic modalities (possible, necessary). The alethic\nmodalities are the best\u2013known and more\u2013basic modality.\nHence, we won\u2019t miss anything by concentrating on them\u201d\n(Sorensen 1992, p. 135). One type of thought experiment \u201cis\ndesigned to refute a statement by showing that something ruled out as\nimpossible by that statement is really possible after all\u201d\n(Sorensen 1992, p. 135). The most discussed examples in the\nmetaphilosophical discussion on thought experiments is of such a type,\nnamely the Gettier scenarios (see Grundmann & Horvarth 2014;\nSaint-Germier 2019). They are designed to refute the claim that all\nknowledge is justified, true belief. They serve as a \u201cnecessity\nrefuter.\u201d The other type collects examples of \u201cpossibility\nrefuters\u201d. They don\u2019t affirm \u201cthe possibility of the\nthought experiment\u2019s content\u201d. Instead, they establish\n\u201ccopossibilities\u201d. A wonderful example is the scenario of\nan omnipotent God who faces the task of creating a stone too heavy for\nthat God to lift. It seems God cannot succeed. The notion of divine\nomnipotence causes some headache here.\n\nA third taxonomy (see Brown 1991, chapter 2), which has not gone\nunchallenged (see Norton 1993b), is more limited than the first two\ninsofar as it focuses largely on the class of those thought\nexperiments that are taken to function in theory choice, which is the\nuse of thought experiments that has been receiving most of the\nattention. According to this taxonomy, the main division is\nconstructive vs. destructive and resembles Karl\nPopper\u2019s distinction between apologetic and\ncritical thought experiments. Popper actually distinguishes\nbetween three types of thought experiments: heuristic (to\nillustrate a theory), critical (against a theory) and\napologetic (in favour of a theory) (see Popper 1959). His\ncase in favour of a critical and against an apologetic use of thought\nexperiments is very limited. He focuses exclusively on quantum physics\nand doesn\u2019t really say much to address the primary\nepistemological challenge presented by the success of critical thought\nexperiments.\n\nAmong destructive thought experiments, the following subtypes\ncan be identified: the simplest of these is to draw out a\ncontradiction in a theory, thereby refuting it. The first part of\nGalileo\u2019s famous falling bodies example does this. It shows that\nin Aristotle\u2019s account, a composite body (cannon ball and musket\nball attached) would have to fall both faster and slower than the\ncannon ball alone. A second subtype is constituted by those thought\nexperiments that aim to show that the theory in question is in\nconflict with other beliefs that we hold. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\nwell-known cat paradox, for instance, does not show that quantum\ntheory (at least on some interpretations) is internally inconsistent\n(see Schr\u00f6dinger 1935, p. 812; translation: Trimmer 1980, p.\n328): \u201cA cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with the\nfollowing diabolical device (which must be secured against direct\ninterference by the cat): in a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit of\nradioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the course of one\nhour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability,\nperhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a\nrelay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic\nacid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one\nwould say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed.\nThe first atomic decay would have poisoned it. The q-function of the\nentire system would express this by having in it the living and the\ndead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal\nparts.\u201d This thought experiment shows that quantum theory (as\ninterpreted by Bohr) is in conflict with some very powerful common\nsense beliefs we have about macro-sized objects such as\ncats\u2013\u2013they cannot be both dead and alive in any sense\nwhatsoever. The bizarreness of superpositions in the atomic world is\nworrisome enough, says Schr\u00f6dinger, but when it implies that same\nbizarreness at an everyday level, it is intolerable. There is a third\nsubtype of negative thought experiments, namely when, in effect, a\ncentral assumption or premise of the thought experiment itself is\nundermined. For example, as we have seen above, Thomson showed with\nher thought experiment that \u201cright to life\u201d and\n\u201cright to what is needed to sustain life\u201d had been run\ntogether. When distinguished, the argument against abortion is\nnegatively affected.\n\nA fourth sub-type of negative thought experiments are \u201ccounter\nthought experiments\u201d (see Brown 2007). Norton very usefully\nintroduces a related idea:\n\u201cthought-experiment/anti-thought-experiment pairs\u201d (see\nNorton 2004, pp. 45\u201349). Above, we have already encountered this\nsubtype in our discussion of Lucretius\u2019 spear-thought\nexperiment, and with Dennett\u2019s reply to Jackson\u2019s much\ndiscussed Mary the colour scientist thought experiment. Here we would\nlike to add one more example, namely Mach\u2019s counter thought\nexperiment against absolute space. In his Principia\nMathematica, Newton offers a pair of thought experiments as\nevidence for absolute space. One is the bucket thought experiment with\nwater climbing the wall (see Fig. 3), the other is about a pair of\nspheres joined by a cord that maintained its tension in otherwise\nempty space (see Fig. 4). The explanation for these phenomena, argues\nNewton, is absolute space: the bucket and the joined spheres are\nrotating with respect to space itself. In response, Mach modifies the\nscenario and argues, contra Newton, that the two spheres would move\ntoward one another thanks to the tension in the cord, and if we\nrotated a very thick, massive ring around a stationary bucket, we\nwould see the water climb the bucket wall. (For further discussion of\nMach\u2019s counter thought experiment to Newton\u2019s see\nK\u00fchne 2006, pp. 191\u2013202). In short, the point of\nMach\u2019s counter thought experiments is to describe the phenomena\nof the thought experiments\u2019 scenarios differently, that is, to\ndeclare that different things would happen. Mach\u2019s counter\nthought experiment undermines our confidence in Newton\u2019s thought\nexperiments. Absolute space might be a plausible explanation of the\nphenomena in Newton\u2019s thought experiments, but now, in light of\nMach\u2019s counter thought experiment, we\u2019re not so sure of\nthe phenomena itself and thus of the idea of absolute space.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Stages in the bucket\nexperiment\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Two spheres held by a cord in\notherwise empty space\n\n\nTo be effective, counter thought experiments needn\u2019t be very\nplausible at all. In a court of law a jury would convict provided\nguilt is established \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d A common\ndefence strategy is to provide an alternative account of the evidence\nthat has just enough plausibility to put the prosecution\u2019s case\ninto some measure of doubt. That is sufficient to undermine it. A\ncounter thought experiment need only do that much to be effective, and\nin this sense it operates like a \u201cnecessity refuter\u201d in\nSorensen\u2019s sense.\n\nIn addition to destructive ones, there is a second type, the\nconstructive thought experiments. Unsurprisingly, there are\nmany ways they could provide positive support for a theory. One of\nthese is to provide a kind of illustration that makes a theory\u2019s\nclaims clear and evident. In such cases thought experiments serve as a\nkind of heuristic aid. A result may already be well established, but\nthe thought experiment can lead to a very satisfying sense of\nunderstanding. In his Principia Mathematica, Newton provides\na wonderful example showing how the moon is kept in its orbit in just\nthe same way as an object falls to the earth (see Ducheyne 2006, pp.\n435\u2013437). He illustrates this by means of a cannon shooting a\ncannon ball further and further (see Fig. 5). In the limit, the earth\ncurves away as fast as the ball falls, with the eventual result being\nthat the cannon ball will return to the spot where it was fired, and,\nif not impeded, will go around again and again. This is what the moon\nis doing. We could arrive at the same conclusion through calculation.\nBut Newton\u2019s thought experiment provides that elusive sense of\nunderstanding. It\u2019s a wonderful example of the \u201caha\neffect\u201d that is typical of many powerful thought\nexperiments.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. \u201cThe shot heard around\nthe world\u201d\n\n\nThomson\u2019s violinist showed that abortion could be morally\npermissible even when the fetus has a right to life. Similarly,\nEinstein\u2019s elevator showed that light will bend in a\ngravitational field, because according to the principle of\nequivalence, there is no difference between such a frame of reference\nand one that is accelerating in free space; the laws of physics are\nthe same in all. Suppose then, an observer is inside an elevator\nsealed off from the outside so that the observer cannot tell whether\nhe is in a gravitational field or accelerating. If it were\naccelerating, and if a light beam were to enter one side, then, due to\nthe elevator\u2019s motion, the beam would appear to drop or curve\ndown as it crossed the elevator. Consequently, it would have to do the\nsame thing if the elevator was in a gravitational field. Therefore,\ngravity \u2018bends\u2019 light.\n\nMaxwell\u2019s demon showed that entropy could be decreased: The\nsecond law of thermodynamics implies that heat won\u2019t pass from a\ncold body to a hot one. In classical thermodynamics this law is quite\nstrict; but in Maxwell\u2019s kinetic theory of heat there is a\nprobability, though extremely small, of such an event happening. Some\nthought this a reductio ad absurdum of Maxwell\u2019s theory. To show\nhow it is possible to violate the second law, Maxwell imagined a tiny\ncreature who controls a door between two chambers. Fast molecules from\nthe cold box are let into the hot box, and slow molecules from the hot\nare allowed into the cold. Thus, there will be an increase in the\naverage speed in the hot box and a decrease in the average speed of\nmolecules in the cold. Since, on Maxwell\u2019s theory, heat is just\nthe average speed of the molecules, there has been a flow of heat from\na cold body to a hot one.\n\nParfit\u2019s splitting persons shows that survival is a more\nimportant notion than identity when considering personhood (for a\ncritical discussion see Gendler 2002a). We say they \u201cshow\u201d\nsuch and such, but, \u201cpurport to show\u201d might be better,\nsince some of these thought experiments are quite contentious. What\nthey have in common is that they aim to establish something positive.\nUnlike destructive thought experiments, they are not trying to\ndemolish an existing theory, though they may do that in passing. To\nrepeat an important point: in principle, given the fact that thought\nexperiments can be rethought (see Bokulich 2001), and that the\nevidential significance is dependent on historical and local\naccomplishments (see McAllister 1996), it cannot be irrelevant to\nidentify the intention of the thought experimenter, if one wants to\ndetermine the type of a thought experiment: \u201cAn imaginary\nexperiment should be judged on its specific purpose\u201d (Krimsky\n1973, p. 331).\n",
