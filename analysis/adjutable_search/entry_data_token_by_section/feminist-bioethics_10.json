Feminist Contributions to Bioethics Theory\n\nThe distinctive analytic toolkit of feminist bioethics has made\nsignificant theoretical contributions to bioethical thinking. Its\nclose relationship with feminism as a political movement has made\nfeminist bioethics highly critical of philosophical bioethics\u2019\nusual privileging of ideal theory (in the sense of being based around\nthe kind of world we would like to have) and of the search\nfor universalizable principles. Both these approaches tend to increase\nthe appeal of abstraction more, making it harder to see the world as\nit is, with persisting inequality and discrimination, and so obscure\nthe need for radical change and especially for realistic ways to\nachieve it. Feminist ethics has responded through the production of\nits own conceptual contributions to broader ethical theory. The most\nsignificant and best known of these are the ethics of care/care\n ethics[1]\n and the concept of relational autonomy.\n",
