    "main_text": "Early Clinical Research\n2. Early Clinical Research\n\nModern clinical research may have begun on the 20th of May,\n1747, aboard the HMS Salisbury. James Lind, the ship\u2019s surgeon,\nwas concerned with the costs scurvy was exacting on British sailors,\nand was skeptical of some of the interventions, cider, elixir of\nvitriol, vinegar, sea-water, being used at the time to treat it.\nUnlike other clinicians of his day, Lind did not simply assume that he\nwas correct and treat his patients accordingly. He designed a study.\nHe chose 12 sailors from among the 30 or so Salisbury\u2019s crew\nmembers who were suffering from scurvy, and divided them into six\ngroups of 2 sailors each. Lind assigned a different intervention to\neach of the groups, including two sailors turned research participants\nwho received 2 oranges and 1 lemon each day. Within a week these two\nwere sailors again; the others remained patients, and several were\ndying.\n\nThe ethics of clinical research begins by asking how we should think\nabout the fate of these latter sailors. Did Lind treat them\nappropriately? Do they have a moral claim against Lind? It is widely\nassumed that physicians should do what they think is best for the\npatient in front of them. Lind, despite being a physician, did not\nfollow this maxim. He felt strongly that giving sea water to\nindividuals with scurvy was a bad idea, but he gave sea water to 2 of\nthe sailors in his study to test whether he, or others, were right. To\nput the fundamental concern raised by clinical research in its\nsimplest form: Did Lind sacrifice these two sailors, patients under\nhis care, for the benefit of others? \n\nLind\u2019s experiments represent perhaps the first modern clinical\ntrial because he attempted to address one of the primary challenges\nfacing those who set out to evaluate medical treatments. How does one\nshow that any differences in the outcomes of the treatments under\nstudy are a result of the treatments themselves, and not a result of\nthe patients who received them, or other differences in the\npatients\u2019 environment or diet? How could Lind be confident that\nthe improvements in the two sailors were the result of the oranges and\nlemons, and not a result of the fact that he happened to give them to\nthe two patients who occupied the most salutary rooms on the ship?\nLind tried to address the challenge of confounding variables by\nbeginning with patients who were as similar as possible. He carefully\nchose the 12 subjects for his experiment from a much larger pool of\nailing sailors; he also tried to ensure that all 12 received the same\nrations each day, apart from the treatments provided as part of his\nstudy. It is also worth noting that Lind\u2019s dramatic results were\nlargely ignored for decades, leading to uncounted and unnecessary\ndeaths, and highlighting the importance of combining clinical research\nwith effective promulgation and implementation. The Royal Navy did not\nadopt citrus rations for another 50 years (Sutton 2003), at which\npoint scurvy essentially disappeared from the Royal Navy.\n\nLind\u2019s experiments, despite controlling for a number of factors,\ndid not exclude the possibility that his own choices of which sailors\ngot which treatment influenced the results. More recent experiments,\nincluding the first modern randomized, placebo controlled trial of\nStreptomycin for TB in 1948 (D\u2019Arcy Hart 1999), attempt to\naddress this concern by assigning treatments to patients using a\nrandom selection process. By randomly assigning patients to treatment\ngroups these studies ushered in the modern era of controlled, clinical\ntrials. And, by taking the choice of which treatment a given patient\nreceives out of the hands of the treating clinician, these trials\nunderscore and, some argue, exacerbate the ethical concerns raised by\nclinical research (Hellman and Hellman 1991). A foundational principle\nof clinical medicine is the importance of individual judgment. A\nphysician who decides which treatments her patients receive by\nflipping a coin is guilty of malpractice. A clinical investigator who\nrelies on the same methods receives awards and gets published in elite\njournals. One might conclude that sacrifice of the interests of some,\noften sick patients, for the benefit of future patients, is\nessentially mandated by the scientific method (Miller & Weijer\n2006; Rothman 2000). The history of clinical research seems to provide\ntragic support for this view.\n",
