    "main_text": "\n\n\nAncient philosophical theories of soul are in many respects sensitive\nto ways of speaking and thinking about the soul [psuch\u00ea]\nthat are not specifically philosophical or theoretical. We therefore\nbegin with what the word \u2018soul\u2019 meant to speakers of\nClassical Greek, and what it would have been natural to think about\nand associate with the soul. We then turn to various Presocratic\nthinkers, and to the philosophical theories that are our primary\nconcern, those of Plato (first in the Phaedo, then in the\nRepublic), Aristotle (in the De Anima or On the\nSoul), Epicurus, and the Stoics.  These are by far the most\ncarefully worked out theories of soul in ancient philosophy.  Later\ntheoretical developments \u2014 for instance, in the writings of\nPlotinus and other Platonists, as well as the Church Fathers \u2014\nare best studied against the background of the classical theories,\nfrom which, in large part, they derive.\n\n Adopting a bird's-eye view of the terrain that we will be covering,\nand setting many details aside for the moment, we can describe it as\nfollows. From comparatively humble Homeric beginnings, the word\n\u2018soul\u2019 undergoes quite remarkable semantic expansion in\nsixth and fifth century usage.  By the end of the fifth century\n\u2014 the time of Socrates' death \u2014 soul is standardly thought\nand spoken of, for instance, as the distinguishing mark of living\nthings, as something that is the subject of emotional states and that\nis responsible for planning and practical thinking, and also as the\nbearer of such virtues as courage and justice. Coming to philosophical\ntheory, we first trace a development towards comprehensive\narticulation of a very broad conception of soul, according to which\nthe soul is not only responsible for mental or psychological functions\nlike thought, perception and desire, and is the bearer of moral\nqualities, but in some way or other accounts for all the vital\nfunctions that any living organism performs. This broad conception,\nwhich is clearly in close contact with ordinary Greek usage by that\ntime, finds its fullest articulation in Aristotle's theory. The\ntheories of the Hellenistic period, by contrast, are interested more\nnarrowly in the soul as something that is responsible specifically for\nmental or psychological functions. They either de-emphasize or sever\nthe ordinary-language connection between soul and life in all its\nfunctions and aspects.\n",
