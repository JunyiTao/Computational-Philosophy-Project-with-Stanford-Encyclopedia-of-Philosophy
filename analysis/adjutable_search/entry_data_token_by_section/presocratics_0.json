Most of them wrote at least one \u201cbook\u201d\n(short pieces of prose writing, or, in some cases, poems), but no\ncomplete work survives. Instead, we depend on later philosophers,\nhistorians, and compilers of collections of ancient wisdom for\ndisconnected quotations (fragments) and reports about their views\n(testimonia). In some cases, these sources were themselves\nable to consult the works of the Presocratics directly. In many\nothers, the line is indirect and often depends on the work of Hippias,\nAristotle, Theophrastus, Simplicius, and other ancient philosophers\nwho did have direct access. All of the sources for the fragments and\ntestimonia made selective use of the material available to them, in\naccordance with their own special, and varied, interests in the early\nthinkers. (For analyses of the doxographic tradition, and the\ninfluence of Aristotle and Theophrastus on later sources, see Mansfeld\n1999; Runia 2008; Mansfeld and Runia 1997, 2009a, and 2009b; Laks and\nMost, 2016.) Despite (or perhaps because of) the fragmentary nature of\nthe evidence, new material occasionally comes to light. In 1962\n\u201cThe Derveni Papyrus,\u201d probably dating from the second\npart of the fourth century B.C.E., was discovered in Greece (Betegh\n2004, Janko 2001, Kotwick 2017). It is primarily concerned with Orphic\nreligion, including a commentary on a poem attributed to\nOrpheus. Through the work of scholars to reconstruct and interpret it\n(see Kouremenos, P\u00e1ssoglou, & Tantsanaglou 2006) it has\nbecome clear that the author of the commentary was familiar with the\nphilosophical theories of the time, and the papyrus has proved\nvaluable to the study of early Greek Philosophy (see, for instance\nBetegh 2014a and 2014b, and Betegh & Piano 2019). Further new\nPresocratic material was found in a papyrus from Upper Egypt, now in\nStrasbourg, that contains texts from Empedocles, some already included\nin DK, but also previously unknown lines which have complicated our\nunderstanding of Empedocles\u2019 thought. (See Martin &\nPrimavesi 1999, and Janko 2001, 2005.) Although any account of\nPresocratic thinkers has to be a reconstruction, we should not be\noverly pessimistic about the possibility of reaching a historically\nresponsible understanding of them.\n\nCalling this group Presocratic  raises certain difficulties.\nThe term, coined in the eighteenth century, was made current by\nHermann Diels in the nineteenth, and was meant to mark a contrast\nbetween Socrates who was interested in moral problems, and his\npredecessors, who were supposed to be primarily concerned with\ncosmological and physical speculation. \u201cPresocratic,\u201d if\ntaken strictly as a chronological term, is not accurate, for the last\nof them were contemporaneous with Socrates and even Plato. Moreover,\nseveral of the early Greek thinkers explored questions about ethics\nand the best way to live a human life. The term may also suggest that\nthese thinkers are somehow inferior to Socrates and Plato, of interest\nonly as their predecessors, and its suggestion of archaism may imply\nthat philosophy only becomes interesting when we arrive at the\nclassical period of Plato and Aristotle. Some scholars now\ndeliberately avoid the term, but if we take it to refer to the early\nGreek thinkers who were not influenced by the views of Socrates,\nwhether his predecessors or contemporaries, there is probably no harm\nin using it. (For discussions of the notion of Presocratic philosophy,\nsee Long\u2019s introduction in Long (ed.) 1999, Laks 2006, the articles in\nLaks and Louguet 2002, and Laks 2018.) \n\nA second problem lies in referring to these thinkers as\nphilosophers. That is almost certainly not how they could\nhave described themselves. While it is true that Heraclitus says that\n\u201cthose who are lovers of wisdom must be inquirers into many\nthings\u201d (DK22B35/LM9D40), the word he uses,\nphilosophos, does not have the special sense that it acquires\nin the works of Plato and Aristotle, when the philosopher is\ncontrasted with both the ordinary person and other experts, including\nthe sophist (particularly in Plato), or in the resulting modern sense\nin which we can distinguish philosophy from physics or psychology. Yet\nthe Presocratics certainly saw themselves as set apart from ordinary\npeople and also from others (certain of the poets and historical\nwriters, for example, as we can see from Xenophanes and Heraclitus)\nwho were their predecessors and contemporaries. As the fragment from\nHeraclitus shows, the early Greek philosophers thought of themselves\nas inquirers into many things, and the range of their inquiry was\nvast. They had views about the nature of the world, and these views\nencompass what we today call physics, chemistry, geology, meteorology,\nastronomy, embryology, and psychology (and other areas of natural\ninquiry), as well as theology, metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.\nIn the earliest of the Presocratics, the Milesians, it can indeed be\ndifficult to discern the strictly philosophical aspects of the views\nin the evidence available to us. Nevertheless, despite the danger of\nmisunderstanding and thus underestimating these thinkers because of\nanachronism, there is an important sense in which it is quite\nreasonable to refer to them as philosophers. That sense is inherent in\nAristotle\u2019s view (see, e.g., Metaphysics I,\nPhysics I, De Anima I, On Generation and\nCorruption I): these thinkers were his predecessors in a\nparticular sort of inquiry, and even though Aristotle thinks that they\nwere all, for one reason or another, unsuccessful and even amateurish,\nhe sees in them a similarity such that he can trace a line of\ncontinuity of both subject and method from their work to his own. The\nquestions that the early Greek philosophers asked, the sorts of\nanswers that they gave, and the views that they had of their own\ninquiries were the foundation for the development of philosophy as it\ncame to be defined in the work of Plato and Aristotle and their\nsuccessors. Perhaps the fundamental characteristic is the commitment\nto explain the world naturalistically, in terms of its own inherent\nprinciples. (For discussions, see Sassi, 2006, 2018.)\n\nBy contrast, consider the 7th century BCE poem of Hesiod,\nhis Theogony (genealogy of the gods). Hesiod tells the\ntraditional story of the Olympian gods, beginning with Chaos, a vague\ndivine primordial entity or condition. From Chaos, a sequence of gods\nis generated, often by sexual congress, but sometimes no cause for\ntheir coming to be is given. The divine figures that thus arise are\noften connected with a part of the physical universe, or with some\naspect of human experience, so his theogony is also a cosmogony (an\naccount of the generation of the world). The divinities (and the\nassociated parts of the world) come to be and struggle violently among\nthemselves; finally Zeus triumphs and establishes and maintains an\norder of power among the others. Hesiod\u2019s world is one in which\nthe major divinities are individuals who behave like super-human\nbeings (Gaia or earth, Ouranos or sky, Cronos \u2014 an unlocated\nregal power, Zeus); some of the others are personified characteristics\n(e.g., Momus, blame; and Dusnomia, lawlessness). For the Greeks, the\nfundamental properties of divinity are immortality (they are not\nsubject to death) and great power (as part of the cosmos or in\nmanaging events), and each of Hesiod\u2019s characters has these\nproperties (even though in the story some are defeated, and seem to be\ndestroyed). Hesiod\u2019s story is like a vast Hollywood-style family\nhistory, with envy, rage, love, and lust all playing important parts\nin the coming-to-be of the world as we know it. The earliest rulers of\nthe universe are violently overthrown by their offspring (Ouranos is\noverthrown by Cronos, Cronos by Zeus). Zeus insures his continued\npower by swallowing his first consort Metis (counsel or wisdom); by\nthis he prevents the predicted birth of rivals and acquires her\nattribute of wisdom (Theogony 886\u2013900). In a second\npoem, Works and Days, Hesiod pays more attention to human\nbeings, telling the story of earlier, greater creatures who died out\nor were destroyed by themselves or Zeus. Humans were created by Zeus,\nare under his power, and are subject to his judgment and to divine\nintervention for either good or ill. Hesiod\u2019s world, like\nHomer\u2019s, is one that is god-saturated, where the gods may\nintervene in all aspects of the world, from the weather to mundane\nparticulars of human life, acting on the ordinary world order, in a\nway that humans, limited as they are by time, location, and narrow\npowers of perception, must accept but cannot ultimately understand.\nThe Presocratics reject this account, instead seeing the world as a\nkosmos, an ordered natural arrangement that is inherently\nintelligible and not subject to supra-natural intervention. A striking\nexample is Xenophanes DK21B32/LM8D9: \u201cAnd she whom they call\nIris, this too is by nature cloud / purple, red, and greeny yellow to\nbehold.\u201d Iris, the rainbow, traditional messenger of the gods,\nis after all, not supra-natural, not a sign from the gods on Olympus\nwho are outside of and immune from the usual world order; rather it\nis, in its essence, colored cloud. (A good discussion of the Hesiodic\nmyths in relation to Presocratic philosophy can be found in McKirahan\n2011. Burkert 2008 surveys influence from the east on the development\nof Presocratic philosophy, especially the myths, astronomy, and\ncosmogony of the Babylonians, Persians, and Egyptians.)\n\nCalling the Presocratics philosophers also suggests that they\nshare a certain outlook; an outlook that can be contrasted with that\nof other early Greeks (see Moore 2020). Although scholars disagree\nabout the extent of the divergence between the early Greek\nphilosophers and their non-philosophical predecessors and\ncontemporaries, it is evident that Presocratic thought exhibits a\ndifference not only in its understanding of the nature of the world,\nbut also in its view of the sort of explanation of it that is\npossible. This is clear in Heraclitus. Although Heraclitus asserts\nthat those who love wisdom must be inquirers into many things, inquiry\nalone is not sufficient. At DK22B40/LMD20 he rebukes four of his\npredecessors: \u201cMuch learning does not teach understanding; else\nit would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and\nHecataeus.\u201d Heraclitus\u2019 implicit contrast is with himself;\nin DK 22B1/LM D9 and D110 he suggests that he alone truly understands\nall things, because he grasps the account that enables him to\n\u201cdistinguish each thing in accordance with its nature\u201d and\nsay how it is. For Heraclitus there is an underlying principle that\nunites and explains everything. It is this that others have failed to\nsee and understand. According to Heraclitus, the four have amassed a\ngreat deal of information \u2014 Hesiod was a traditional source of\ninformation about the gods, Pythagoras was renowned for his learning\nand especially views about how one ought to live, Xenophanes taught\nabout the proper view of the gods and the natural world, Hecataeus was\nan early historian \u2014 but because they have failed to grasp the\ndeeper significance of the facts available to them, their unconnected\nbits of knowledge do not constitute understanding. Just as the world\nis a kosmos, an ordered arrangement, so too, human knowledge\nof that world must be ordered in a corresponding way.\n",
