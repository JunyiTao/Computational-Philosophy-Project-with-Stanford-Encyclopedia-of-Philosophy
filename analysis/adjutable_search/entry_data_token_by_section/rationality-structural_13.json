    "main_text": "The Normative Significance of Structural Rationality || Transparency and Apparent Reasons Accounts\n3.3 Transparency and Apparent Reasons Accounts\n\nIf there are not necessarily reasons to conform with requirements of\nstructural rationality, this raises the questions of whether there is\nsome other interesting relation between structural rationality and\nreasons, and whether there is an explanation of why it has seemed to\nmany that structural rationality is normatively significant. Two\nprominent views in the literature on rationality \u2013 the\ntransparency account and the apparent reasons account \u2013 provide\nanswers to these questions.\n\nAccording to the transparency account, structural rationality\nis a matter of coherence between one\u2019s attitudes and one\u2019s\nnormative beliefs about such attitudes, and for an attitude to be\nrequired by structural rationality is for one to have a belief that\nthis attitude is supported by conclusive reasons (Kolodny 2005, and on\none reading, Scanlon 2007). On this view, the apparent normativity of\nstructural rationality is due to the fact that from the first-personal\nstandpoint, rationally required attitudes are always believed\nto be supported by conclusive reasons.\n\nThe transparency account faces problems, however. First, the normative\nappearance of rationality is not limited to the first-personal\nperspective. We seem to presuppose that rationality is normatively\nsignificant when we recommend options as rational or\ncriticize responses as irrational, and the hypothesis that\nrationally required responses must be believed to be\nnormatively supported by the agent for whom they are required\ndoes not help to understand this (Bridges 2009; Hussain 2007 \u2013\nsee Other Internet Resources). Second, the assumption that structural\nirrationality always involves a conflict between an attitude and a\nnormative belief about that attitude is questionable: a number of\nplausible instances of structural irrationality \u2013 in particular\nthose involved in certain forms of belief inconsistency and means-end\nincoherence (see \u00a71.4) \u2013 do not seem to involve such a\nconflict.\n\nWhile the transparency account explains rationality in terms of\nbelieved reasons, the apparent reasons account explains rationality in\nterms of \u201capparent reasons\u201d, which are usually understood\nas the reasons we would have if our beliefs were true (e. g.\nParfit 2011; Schroeder 2009; Way 2009; Whiting 2014; Alvarez 2018; see\nalso Sylvan 2015 for a more sophisticated conception of apparent\nreasons). It has been stated as the view that \u201cfor you to be\nrationally required to \\(A\\) is for it to be the case that you would\nhave conclusive reasons to \\(A\\), if your beliefs were true\u201d\n(Way 2009, 4). Parfit (2001) first proposed a view along these lines,\narguably as an account of substantive rationality. However,\nseveral authors have tried to explain structural rationality (and, by\nextension, its apparent or actual normative force) in terms of\napparent reasons as well (Schroeder 2009; Way 2012; Sylvan 2021a).\n\nSome proponents of the apparent reasons account suggest that\nrationality is in fact normative on their view. For example, Schroeder\n(2009) identifies rational requirements with \u201csubjective\noughts\u201d, which he takes to be genuinely normative, and Parfit\nclaims that \u201cnormativity involves reasons or apparent\nreasons\u201d (2011, 59). According to Way (2009), the apparent\nreasons account vindicates the normativity of rationality, because it\nexplains rational requirements in terms of hypothetical truths of the\nform \u2018If your beliefs were true, you would have conclusive\nreason to A\u2019 \u2013 and such truths are in an interesting sense\nnormative, as a normative error theorist is committed to denying them.\nHowever, critics have contended that the sense in which hypotheticals\nabout reasons are normative is a merely technical one that does\nnothing to vindicate the actual normative significance of\nrationality (Kiesewetter 2012). (For more on the normative relevance\nof apparent reasons, see Gonz\u00e1lez de Prado Salas 2018; Sylvan\n2021a).)\n\nThe apparent reasons account also faces similar challenges as the\ntransparency account when it comes to accounting for kinds of\nstructural irrationality that do not involve attitudes with normative\ncontents. While it is straightforward that akratic agents go against\nwhat would be conclusive reasons if their beliefs were true, it is\nmuch more difficult to see that this is true for agents with\n\u201cformally incoherent\u201d attitudes, such as incoherent\ncredences.\n",
