    "main_text": "When is Blame Appropriate? || .3 Other Blamer-Based Worries\n2.4 Varieties of Blame\n\nBecause the nature of blame is controversial, we have tended in this\nsection simply to use the word \u201cblame\u201d, but it\u2019s important\nto remember that one\u2019s views about the ethics of blame will very much\ndepend on what one takes blame to be. For instance, although\nhypocritical moral address (to use Wallace\u2019s term) seems clearly to\nunderwrite the legitimacy of a \"who are you\" charge, it is less clear\nwhether merely harboring a hypocritical blaming judgment is likewise\ninappropriate, or inappropriate in quite the same way. In general, the\ndifference between expressed and unexpressed blame\nis an important distinction to keep in mind when theorizing about the\nways in which blame can go wrong (see Fritz and Miller 2018; Todd\nforthcoming). \n\nMoreover, blame seems to be just one among many ways that we respond\nto wrongdoing, and it\u2019s still an open question just how blame relates\nto activities like holding responsible, demanding answers, punishing,\nand so on. (For some attempted taxonomies, see Macnamara 2011;\nShoemaker 2011; Smith 2012; Tognazzini 2015.) So, answers to the above\nquestions about the ethics of blame will not automatically double as\nanswers to analogous questions about the ethics of these other ways of\ninteracting.\n",
