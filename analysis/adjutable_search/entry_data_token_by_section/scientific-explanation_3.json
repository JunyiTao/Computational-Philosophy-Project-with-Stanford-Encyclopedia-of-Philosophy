    "main_text": "The DN Model || Inductive Statistical Explanation\n2.3 Inductive Statistical Explanation\n\nThe DN model is meant to capture explanation via deduction\nfrom deterministic laws and this raises the obvious question of the\nexplanatory status of statistical laws. Do such laws explain at all\nand if so, what do they explain, and under what conditions? Hempel\n(1965b) distinguishes two\nvarieties of statistical explanation. The first of these,\ndeductive-statistical (DS) explanation, involves the\ndeduction of \u201ca narrower statistical uniformity\u201d from a\nmore general set of premises, at least one of which involves a more\ngeneral statistical law. Since DS explanation involves\ndeduction of the explanandum from a law, it conforms to the same\ngeneral pattern as the DN explanation of regularities.\nHowever, in addition to DS explanation, Hempel also\nrecognizes a distinctive sort of statistical explanation, which he\ncalls inductive-statistical or IS explanation,\ninvolving the subsumption of individual events (like the recovery of a\nparticular person from streptococcus infection) under (what he regards\nas) statistical laws (such as a law specifying the probability of\nrecovery, given that penicillin has been taken).\n\nWhile the explanandum of a DN or DS explanation can\nbe deduced from the explanans, one cannot deduce that some particular\nindividual, John Jones, has recovered from the above statistical law\nand the information that he has taken penicillin. At most what can be\ndeduced from this information is that recovery is more or less\nprobable. In IS explanation, the relation between explanans\nand explanandum is, in Hempel\u2019s words, \u201cinductive,\u201d\nrather than deductive\u2014hence the name inductive-statistical\nexplanation. The details of Hempel\u2019s account are complex, but\nthe underlying idea is roughly this: an IS explanation will\nbe good or successful to the extent that its explanans confers high\nprobability on its explanandum outcome.\n\nThus if it is a statistical law that the probability of recovery from\nstreptococcus, given that one has taken penicillin, is high, and Jones\nhas taken penicillin and recovered, this information can be used to\nprovide an IS explanation of Jones\u2019s recovery. However\nif the probability of recovery is low (e.g., less than 0.5), given\nthat Jones has taken penicillin, then, even if Jones recovers, we\ncannot use this information to provide an IS explanation of\nhis recovery.\n",
