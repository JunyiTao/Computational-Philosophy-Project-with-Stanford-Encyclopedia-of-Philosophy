    "main_text": "Specific Fields || Epistemology\n5.3 Epistemology\n\nThe Greeks, according to Anderson,\n\nare far clearer on many questions than modern philosophers \u2026\nthey avoid many modern errors, and especially \u2026 they are not,\nlike the moderns, obsessed with \u2018the problem of knowledge\u2019\n\u2013 they do not set out to discover (i.e., to know!) how, or how\nmuch, we can know, before they are prepared to know anything. This\n\u2018criticism of the instrument\u2019 amounts to scientific\ndefeatism, and the instrumental view of mind has both prevented a\nknowledge of minds themselves, and hampered the direct inquiry into\nlogical and other scientific problems. (EMP, 82)\n\n\nAnderson\u2019s Hegelian diagnoses of the obsessions of modern\nphilosophy and Cartesianism with epistemology are likely to elicit\nrecognition and appreciation from many contemporary readers.\nCartesianism in modern philosophy represented for Anderson an\nanti-classicist movement: an antipathy towards history and tradition.\nModern philosophy searched within abstract rationality as the ground\nof human knowledge, rather than in concrete and many-sided culture.\nThe whole modern era was characterised by this lack of concreteness\n(EMP, 195). \n\nHegel in this regard stands out as a lonely classical figure within\nthe history of modern philosophy (EMP, 201).\nPhilosophy since Descartes has become infected by practicalism and\nprogressivism and logic has been reduced to the status of an\ninstrument, a generalised method for acquiring new knowledge. Along\nwith this instrumental view of logic came contempt for the syllogism,\nreplaced by Bacon with \u201cinductive reasoning\u201d and by\nDescartes with rational intuition. \n\nEmpiricism for Anderson is primarily the denial of any higher form of\nbeing, any other reality by which experienced reality can be found\nwanting, or dependent, or in a position of striving to emulate, and so\nforth. So also, the importance of modern realism lies not in its\naccount of knowledge, but its development of a theory of independence,\nthe rejection of any conception of relative existence and the\ndevelopment of a logic of situations (JAA, Philosophy\nII Distinction Lectures, 1937).\n\nThere is no criterion of \u201ctruth\u201d, \u201cnothing by\nbelieving which we believe something else\u201d\n(EMP, 55). Truth is simply what is conveyed by the\ncopula, the \u201cis\u201d of the proposition. It cannot reside in\ncorrespondence between a believed proposition and something else we\ncall reality, nor in relations between propositions in terms of\ncoherence. Propositions are not forms of words: we convey our beliefs\nby words, but what we are putting forward for acceptance is not the\nform of words but the state of affairs itself. Representionalist and\ncorrespondence theories of truth are \u201cattempts to get behind the\nproposition \u2013 to maintain (in words!) that we mean more than we\ncan say.\u201d (EMP, 5). We must abandon the notion\nof \u201cthought\u201d as something contrasted with or identified\nwith things. Our thoughts are just our dealings with things \u2013\nAnderson shared with Norman Kemp Smith a quasi-Calvinist conception of\nknowledge as a striving and grappling with problems rather than\nmirroring an external reality. Anderson dismisses most contemporary\nphilosophies as \u201cvarieties of representationalism\u201d\n(EMP, 87). The proposition is not \u201cabout\u201d\nanything in the sense of representing an external reality. \n\nOne of Anderson\u2019s most audacious articles was the 1934\n\u201cMind as Feeling\u201d which attempts to work out exactly how\nmentality should be conceived as belonging to the spatio-temporal\nrealm. Anderson believed that once we admit the spatial nature of mind\nor of anything mental, \u201cCartesianism goes\u201d\n(JAA, Lectures on Reid, 1935.) The mental realm\nconsists as much of situations as the natural and social world, so our\nknowledge of mind is on the same footing as the non-mental. He\nrepudiates the Cartesian subject-object model which sees\nphilosophy\u2019s task as the study of the medium for knowledge\nunderstood as the relation whereby one entity reproduces within itself\nthe essence or intrinsic characteristics of some other entity. There\nis no such medium for there are not different entities within space\nand time requiring such mediation. There is no \u201cknower\u201d\nconceived as a point of consciousness that has stepped outside\nhistory, outside of space and time. In our striving and grappling with\nillusions so as to come to terms with ourselves and the things around\nus we never step outside the movement of things, nor see behind the\nproposition; never reach outside the realm of propositional claim and\ncounter-claim.\n\nWhat is this thing that strives? Anderson adopts a Nietzschean,\npre-Socratic view of mentality as a social structure of instincts and\npassions competing and cooperating. It is the emotions or feelings\nthemselves that strive. The passion of curiosity, for example, is the\nactual agent of inquiry. There is no entity of conscious willing that\ndirects our attention on the world. \u201cPart of the deception, of\ncourse, part of the \u2018analytic\u2019 myth, is of an egoistic\ncharacter (\u2018what do I find when I set my analysis\nmachine rumbling?\u2019), and this is opposed to the fact that\nlanguage and inquiry are inherent in social life, are at all stages\npart of communication.\u201d (EMP, 181.)\n\nThat critical inquiry itself rests on the existence of specific ways\nof carrying on and proceeds from within some definite way of life,\nprovides one important link with the ethical aspect of\nAnderson\u2019s thought. Such ways of life which lift individuals out\nof their humdrum existence and base material concerns are what\nAnderson regards as the embodiment of ethical goodness. For Anderson\nif the good exists we must find it as a natural quality in this world,\njust as we come to know and identify other natural qualities. However,\nthe good is not merely something we discover, but \u201cthat by which\nwe discover things\u201d (EMP, 266). Anderson was\naware that his view of the good as a natural quality would not\nconvince everyone, and that he could do little to convert the\ndoubters. But he claimed that there will be those who recognise the\ntruth of his position, seeing this view of the good as\n\u201csomething with which they have long been in a certain way\nacquainted\u201d (EMP, 267).\n",
