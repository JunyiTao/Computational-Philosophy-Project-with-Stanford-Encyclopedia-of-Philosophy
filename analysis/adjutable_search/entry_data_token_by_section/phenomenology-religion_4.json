    "main_text": "Emotions and religious experience || Emotional feelings and encounter with God\n2.1 Emotional feelings and encounter with God\n\nI say \u201cemotional feelings\u201d in the heading here to\ndistinguish this case from various other uses of feeling language: as\nfor example when we say that we felt something was missing, a usage\nthat may imply no particular phenomenology but only some intuitive\nregistering of an absence, or when we say that we felt a stab of pain,\nwhich will imply some sort of phenomenology but need not suggest the\nkind of directedness that is typical of emotional feelings, as I shall\nsuggest shortly. (Compare Ryle 1971.)\n\nAs with the question of its phenomenology more generally, so there is\ncontroversy surrounding the contribution of emotional feelings, in\nparticular, to the character of religious experience. William Alston\nhas asked: if the phenomenological content of a religious experience\nwere to be purely affective, would that be a reason for doubting that\nit is directed at anything? In that case, he notes, we might well\nsuspect that the experience consists in a felt response to a believed\npresence (1991, pp. 49\u201350), rather than in some presentation of\nGod to the believer.\n\nThis sort of scepticism about the contribution of the emotions to the\nintentionality or God-directedness of religious experience reflects a\ncertain model of their structure, according to which they are\ncomprised of a thought component and a feeling component, where the\nfirst gives rise to the second (as the thought of God\u2019s presence\nis said, in this case, to cause a certain feeling). For example,\nembarrassment on this account will involve the thought (which may be\nsimply entertained rather than asserted) that I have done something\nthat will lower the regard in which I am held by others \u2014 where\nthis thought gives rise to a feeling of a broadly negative nature,\ninvolving some sort of pain, discomfort or distress (and depending on\nthe model, the particular character of this feeling may be taken to be\nrelative to embarrassment or kindred emotions, or understood in more\ngeneric terms) (see Budd 1985, Chapter 1).\n\nSo on this standard account, emotion types can be differentiated by\nreference to the thoughts of which they are comprised. Or where two\nemotions have the same thought content, they can be differentiated by\nreference to the state of feeling that is engendered by the thought,\nas when we treat pity and schadenfreude as distinct emotion types,\nsince they involve different felt responses to the thought of someone\nelse\u2019s misfortune.\n\nThis account of the emotions allows that they are directed at the\nworld. So they are not, on this view, to be assimilated to mere\nstomach churnings or twinges or throbbings: they have some sort of\nintellectual content, and they involve more, therefore, than simply a\nregistering in feeling of some physiological disturbance. (Compare\nagain the case of embarrassment: this is not just a matter of feeling\nflushed, and so on.) On this point then, this account locates\nemotional experience more firmly within our intellectual life than did\nthe late nineteenth century and early twentieth century account,\nassociated with William James and others, which treated the emotions\nsimply as ways of recording changes in physiological condition (James\n1884). However, it remains true on this perspective that the\ndirectedness of the emotions is a function of their thought content,\nwhich is understood in distinction from their feeling content.\n\nSome more recent theories have wanted to challenge this distinction,\nand to regard emotional feelings as themselves forms of thought, or as\nhaving in their own right an intellectual content. This much is often\nimplied in our description of such feelings, as, for example, when we\ncharacterise schadenfreude as a matter of taking pleasure in\nsomeone\u2019s misfortune. This is to represent the pleasure that\narises here as directed at some state of affairs of which it is\ncognisant, rather than supposing simply that the thought of\nsomeone\u2019s misfortune gives rise to a feeling of pleasure.\n\nIf we allow that emotional feelings can have some intellectual content\nin their own right, then we have a powerful tool for understanding how\nthe affective phenomenology of religious experience may turn out to be\nintegral to its God-directedness. For example, returning to\nAlston\u2019s concerns regarding the contribution of emotional\nfeelings to the phenomenal content of religious experience, if we take\nemotional feelings to be intrinsically contentful, then we may wish to\nsay that the phenomenology of a religious experience could be purely\naffective without this posing any difficulty for the thought that the\nexperience is directed at some mind-independent reality \u2014 rather\nthan being simply a sensation-like feeling that is caused by the\nthought that God is present.\n\nThe idea that emotional feelings may constitute a mode of perception\nis a familiar theme in recent work in moral philosophy, in the\nwritings of John McDowell (1981) and others. It has also been defended\nby various philosophers of emotion. For example, John Deigh (1994)\nwrites of how our perception of certain qualities may be realised in\nour felt response to them: I may register the scariness of something\nin my feeling of being scared, rather than say in an affect-neutral\nperception of the thing as scary, which then engenders a felt\nresponse. And analogously we might suppose that on occasions anyway,\nGod is made manifest in certain felt responses, rather than being\nknown in some other fashion, which then gives rise to a correlative\nfeeling (as on the thought-plus-feeling model of emotion).\n\nAt least some elements of Rudolf Otto\u2019s The Idea of the\nHoly (1959) lend themselves to an interpretation of this kind.\nHere, Otto speaks of how God is made known primordially as the\nmysterium tremendum et fascinans, as a reality that is at once\nattractive but also inspires a kind of fear or dread. This sort of\ndread, Otto insists, is sui generis: it is a distinctively religious\nkind of fear that befits our relation to God, and while it is akin to\nthe fear we associate with the \u201cweird,\u201d it is not to be\nsimply conflated with this or any other kind of non-religious\nfear.\n\nOtto distinguishes this approach from Schleiermacher\u2019s\ndiscussion of the \u201cfeeling of absolute dependence.\u201d He\nwrites:\n\nAccording to him the religious emotion would be directly and\nprimordially a sort of self-consciousness, a feeling\nconcerning oneself in a special, determined relation, viz.,\none\u2019s dependence. Thus, according to Schleiermacher, I can only\ncome upon the very fact of God as the result of an inference, that is,\nby reasoning to a cause beyond myself to account for my \u2018feeling\nof dependence\u2019. (Chapter III, p. 10)\n\n\nSo on Schleiermacher\u2019s account, as read by Otto, the divine\nreality is not disclosed directly in feeling, but is instead inferred\nfrom feeling. By contrast, Otto gives this view of the matter:\n\u201cRather, the \u2018creature-feeling\u2019 is itself a first\nsubjective concomitant and effect of another feeling-element, which\ncasts it like a shadow, but which in itself indubitably has immediate\nand primary reference to an object outside the self\u201d (p. 10).\nHere, Otto commits himself to the thought that the divine reality is\ndisclosed directly in states of feeling, where those states can in\nturn give rise to other states of feeling, including the feeling of\ndependence.\n\nOf course, there is a further question about how exactly\n\u201cGef\u00fchl\u201d is to be read in this context, but at least\nsome of the \u201cfeelings\u201d that, according to Otto,\nnon-inferentially disclose the divine reality seem to be affectively\ncharged. For instance, when discussing the \u201cawefulness\u201d\nthat belongs to the \u201ctremendum\u201d dimension of the\nexperience, Otto notes the connection between this feeling and\n\u201cshuddering\u201d or \u201cfeeling horror in the real sense of\nthe word,\u201d and he adds that \u201c\u2018shuddering\u2019 is\nsomething more than \u2018natural\u2019, ordinary fear\u201d\n(Chapter IV, p. 15). Moreover, he begins this chapter by remarking that\n\u201cthe nature of the numinous can only be suggested by means of\nthe special way in which it is reflected in the mind in terms of\nfeeling\u201d (p. 13). In these respects, there is at least some\nbasis for the idea that, in Otto\u2019s judgement, God is presented,\ndirectly and non-inferentially, in our affective responses. And these\nresponses, we might suppose, can play this sort of role because of\ntheir distinctive phenomenological character, which marks them out\nfrom the kinds of feeling that arise in other domains of life.\n(Contrast the dialectical model of the relationship between perception\nand feeling that is envisaged in Alvin Plantinga\u2019s discussion of\nJonathan Edwards: Plantinga 2000, pp. 301\u2013303.)\n\nOtto extends this account to provide a theory of religious language\n\u2014 doctrinal claims are, he thinks, an attempt to convey in\nrational, conceptually articulate terms the content of a\n\u201cnuminous\u201d experience that is itself conceptually\ninarticulate. So here, far from thought generating a correlative\nfeeling, it is feeling and its implicit reckoning with the nature of\nsome transcendent reality that comes first, and discursive thought\nthat follows on behind, trying to stammer out what is known in full\nonly in the relevant experience. One implication of this account is,\nclearly, that the idea of God has some phenomenological content. (See\nSchlamm 1992 for a defence of Otto\u2019s stance on this point, in\nresponse to the criticisms of Katz and others. Murphy 2022 seeks to\ncombine Otto\u2019s approach and the perspective of \u201cperfect\nbeing theology\u201d.)\n",
