    "main_text": "Arguments for Closed Borders || Democracy\n1.7 Democracy\n\n\nDemocratic governance provides another potential link between\nself-determination and controls on immigration. Given that\ndemocracy\u2019s principal virtue is thought to be its connection to\nself-determination, democrats often favor bounded groups which enjoy\ndominion over their own affairs. As Frederick Whelan puts it,\n\u201cdemocracy requires that people be divided into\npeoples (each people hopefully enjoying its own democratic\ninstitutions), with each unit distinguishing between its own\ncitizens\u2014understood in a political sense as those eligible to\nexercise democratic political rights here\u2014and others,\nwho are regarded as aliens here, although (hopefully) citizens\nsomewhere else.\u201d (Whelan 1988: 28) The basic idea here is\nthat, in order for democracies to function, there must be rule\nby the same people upon whom the rule is imposed. But\nthis is possible only if the same group of individuals who first vote\nare subsequently bound by the outcome. If membership constantly\nfluctuated, however, then self-determination would not occur, because\nthe \u201cself\u201d that votes would not match the\n\u201cself\u201d which is then bound by the results.\n\n\nIn response, theorists like Phillip Cole (2000) have suggested at\nleast two grounds on which we might question whether democracy requires\nclosed borders. First, even if Whelan is right that democracy\ncannot function properly unless we sort people into territorially\ndefined groups (What is wrong with a democratic world state, for\ninstance?), why does it follow that the constituents within any given\nset of territorial boundaries must have control over admissions?\nCiting local and regional democratic units within larger federal\nstructures as counterexamples, Coles suggests that \u201c[i]t seems\nclear that democratic rights can be confined to a region, with people\nentering and leaving that region freely and exercising the local\ndemocratic rights during their residency.\u201d (Cole 2000: 184)\nSecond, Cole suggests that one of the chief reasons to insist upon\ndemocracy in the first place is presumably the belief that coercive\npolitical institutions could not permissibly be imposed unless those\ncoerced are given an equal say in how the political arrangements are\nordered. But if so, this makes extending suffrage to only those\nalready within the territorial boundaries objectionable, because, as\nCole reminds us, \u201cthere are two groups subjected to the laws of\nthe state: its own members, and those non-members who are\napplying for inclusion.\u201d (Cole 2000: 186) Thus, because\nexclusive immigration laws are coercively imposed upon foreigners who\nseek to enter, democratic principles suggest that these outsiders\nshould also have a say in immigration laws. So if Cole is right,\nthe democratic case for closed borders is doubly problematic. Not\nonly is it false that open borders is inconsistent with a functioning\ndemocracy, democratic principles may even prohibit a state\u2019s\ncoercively excluding disenfranchised foreigners from entering its\nterritory.\n",
