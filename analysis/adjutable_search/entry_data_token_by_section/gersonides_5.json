    "main_text": "Ethical Views\n6. Ethical Views\n\nGersonides is not known for his ethical views; as we have seen, most\nof his philosophical writings engage matters in the natural sciences.\nIn his biblical commentaries, however, Gersonides focuses on a number\nof ethical issues. To take one example, Gersonides\u2019 commentary\non Songs of Songs is imbued with an extended discussion of\nhuman felicity. In this work, he claims that because of their inherent\nweakness and epistemological imperfections, most human beings are\nincapable of achieving felicity: \u201conly very few individuals can\nacquire even a large measure of it.\u201d (Gersonides, Songs of\nSongs, 6) For these masses, the Torah and its commandments\nfunction as the best guide to moral perfection. But if immortality is\npredicated on intellectual knowledge, and if philosophers such as\nMaimonides and Gersonides have argued that many individuals are\npsycho-physically incapable of embarking on such a rigorous and\nphilosophical course of study, does it follow that not all humans can\nachieve intellectual perfection: is the road the same, and open, to\nall? And is there only one road to ultimate felicity, or are there\nmany routes?\n\nHorwitz claims that this theme is apparent in Gersonides\u2019\nbiblical commentaries: \u201ca central role of Ralbag\u2019s biblical\ncommentaries is the desire to help his readers attain eternal\nintellectual felicity through knowledge of the truth.\u201d (Horwitz 2006,\np. 124) Nowhere is this emphasis seen more clearly than in\nGersonides\u2019 commentary to Song of Songs. Ostensibly the\nSong of Songs describes the love affair and desires of a\nshepherd for a maiden. Generations of commentators saw in the work an\nallegory of the relation between God and the people Israel.\nGersonides, however, provides a philosophical reading of the work that\nincorporates two sets of subsidiary dialogues, first between the human\nmaterial intellect and the Active Intellect, and second between the\nfaculties of the soul and the material intellect. Gersonides spells\nout the import of these discussions in his introduction to the work.\nHe first lays down the premise that \u201cman\u2019s ultimate felicity\nresides in cognizing and knowing God to the extent that is possible\nfor him.\u201d (Song of Songs, 5) Such knowledge is achieved\nthrough observation of the state of existing things in the natural\nuniverse, that is, through the beings that God has created and caused.\nKnowledge of God, therefore, is predicated on knowledge of the natural\norder.\n\nGersonides then unpacks the various levels of enlightenment that he\nfinds in Song of Songs, moving from mathematics, to physics,\nastronomy and finally metaphysics. In this way, Gersonides emphasizes\nthe natural sciences, in particular physics, as a propadeutic to\nmetaphysics. Gersonides is clear that the science of physics builds\nupon moral knowledge derived from Scripture: \u201cthis science is\nimpossible for one who is not strongly settled on the true views from\nthe perspective of Torah and speculation.\u201d (Gersonides Song of\nSongs, 11). Gersonides then unpacks the various allegories and\nsymbolic representations in the work, all of which point to the goal\nof ultimate felicity as the union with God via the Active\nIntellect.\n",
