Some Complexities: A Humungous Fungus and Coral Reefs\n\nIn the early 1990s, a team of biologists reported in the journal\nNature that they had found high levels of genetic identity in\nsamples of a species of fungus (Armillaris bulbosa), which\nhad taken over a large geographic region in Michigan\u2019s Upper\nPeninsula. They used this data to make a case for viewing these\nsamples as constituting parts of one gigantic biological individual\nwith an estimated biomass of more than ten tons and an estimated age\nexceeding 1500 years. They concluded that \u201cmembers of the fungal\nkingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest\norganisms on earth\u201d (Smith, Bruhn, & Anderson 1992: 431).\nSome scientists have questioned whether this final claim about the\norganismal status of the humungous fungus is warranted, and some have\nargued it is mistaken to say the gigantic fungus constitutes a single\nbiological individual. Since then, other scientists have recognized\neven larger funguses as biological individuals (Schmitt & Tatum\n2008).\n\nHow does one judge such claims and disputes? Minimally, more empirical\ninformation about the example is needed. Is the fungus a continuous\nbiological structure? Does it have a determinate growth pattern? Can\nit reproduce? But this empirical information alone doesn\u2019t\nsettle the matter. One must also draw on antecedent concepts of\norganism and biological individual. The empirical information, in\nturn, also allows one to fine-tune, amend, or challenge those\nantecedent concepts, better so than would common sense reflection\nalone. For example, if the humungous fungus is not an organism but\nsome other sort of biological individual, which empirical\nconsiderations motivate this distinction?\n\nConsider a more elaborately described example (Turner 2000: ch.2; see\nalso Skillings 2016: 877\u2013879). Coral reefs are spectacular and\nbeautiful parts of the living world, despite rapidly becoming a thing\nof the past due to the climate changes associated with global warming.\nAt least at the ground level of common sense, they are often thought\nof as consisting of two chief components. The first are accretions of\ncalcite deposits. The second are the small animals, polyps, which\nproduce and grow on the deposits. (Coral polyps belong to the same\nLinnaean class as sea anemones, and to the same Linnaean phylum as\njellyfish.) The polyps are indisputably biological individuals. But\nfurther, conservation biologists also often describe the coral reefs\nthemselves, consisting of the polyps and the deposits considered\ntogether, as living things that can grow and die.\n\nThe reefs are at least biological individuals, typically being thought\nof as ecosystems; formal methods already exist for modeling them as\nsuch (e.g., Huneman 2014). And taking seriously their life, growth and\ndeath leads to the question of whether they too might be organisms: to\na first approximation, metabolically-circumscribed entities that are\nrelatively well-integrated and function as a whole. The dependence\nrelations between the reefs and the polyps does not rule this out,\nsince such dependence is common in organisms. Human beings depend on\ninternal bacteria that outnumber our own cells by about ten to one,\nand yet they are organisms (Ackerman 2012). Similarly, the polyps that\nreefs depend on are themselves dependent on single-celled algae,\ncommonly referred to as zooxanthellae, for the glucose that\nprovides the energy necessary for polyp respiration, which in turn\ndrives the process of calcification. Moreover, it is the zooxanthellae\nthat supply the pigments that give living corals their spectacular\ncolors; when zooxanthellae are absent or diminished, this signals a\nproblem for the long-term survival of a coral reef. Neither are the\nzooxanthellae free of dependence. By infecting the polyps they gain a\nfeeding den crucial to their survival.\n\nFurther reflection along these lines may suggest that an integrated\ncausal network of dependence relations is a mark of being an organism\nor biological individual; \u201ccausal integration, cohesion,\ncollaboration, or agency of parts\u201d is the criterion on Lidgard\nand Nyhart\u2019s (2017a) list of criteria that they found most often\ncited in the literature they reviewed. If that were so, then the coral\nreef may come to be viewed as a better exemplar of either than are the\npolyps and zooxanthellae, as the reef enjoys a kind or degree of\ncomplex, functional integrity that polyps and zooxanthellae arguably\nlack when considered singly (see also Combes 2001). Alternatively,\nperhaps the reef should be thought of as some other kind of biological\nindividual, such as an ecosystem, that contains several distinct\norganisms, the polyps and the zooxanthellae, as proper parts.\n\nAgain, knowing what to say about the striking claim that the\npolyp-zooxanthellae-calcite deposit complex is an organism turns in\npart on the empirical facts, but on more than just those. Polyps,\nzooxanthellae and whole reef complexes do not wear placards that state\nwhich is an example of an organism, and whether all three should be\nviewed as biological individuals of some kind or other (and which\nkind). The interplay between our conceptions and empirical\ncomplexities both allows those conceptions to be unpacked and informs\nhow they might be regimented to better capture nuances of the\nbiological world inaccessible to commonsense reflection alone. \n\nThis interplay has recently involved philosophers and biologists\nattending more squarely to the microbial world\n(O\u2019Malley, Simpson, & Roger 2013; O\u2019Malley 2014),\nrecognizing the various tight integrative and collaborative relations\nbetween what prima facie are distinct biological individuals\n(Dupr\u00e9 & O\u2019Malley 2009, Ereshefsky & Pedroso\n2015), and trying to make sense of the diversity one finds in the\nprocesses of reproduction, metabolism, and development (Godfrey-Smith\n2016b, Griesemer 2016). The next section provides an introductory\nsurvey of this interplay via discussion of three subsidiary\nquestions.\n",
