Life and Writings\n\n\nThe dramatic occasion of Plato\u2019s dialogue, Parmenides, is a \nvisit to Athens by the eminent philosopher Parmenides and Zeno, his \nyounger associate, to attend the festival of the Great Panathenaea. \nPlato describes Parmenides as about sixty-five years old, Zeno as \nnearly forty, and Socrates, with whom they converse, as \u201cquite \nyoung then,\u201d which is normally taken to mean about twenty. \nGiven that Socrates was a little past seventy when executed by the \nAthenians in 399 B.C.E., this description suggests that Zeno was born \nabout 490 B.C.E. He would appear to have been active in Magna Graecia, \nthat is, the Greek-speaking regions of southern Italy, during the \nmid-fifth century B.C.E. There is otherwise little credible information\nabout the circumstances of his life. Diogenes Laertius\u2019s brief \n\u201cLife of Zeno\u201d (D.L. 9.25\u20139) is largely taken up with \nstitching together conflicting reports of his involvement in a brave \nplot to overthrow one of the local tyrants, but how much truth these \nreports contain cannot be determined. Although Diogenes also says \nthat Zeno so loved his native Elea that he had no interest in \nimmigrating to Athens, this report is not inconsistent with his \nhaving spent some time there; and Plutarch\u2019s report that Pericles \nheard Zeno expounding on the nature of things in the manner of \nParmenides (Plu. Pericles 4.5) suggests that Zeno may indeed\nhave visited Athens and read his famous book, as Plato\u2019s \nParmenides implies, to a group of intellectually keen \nAthenians. Vivid evidence of the cultural impact of Zeno\u2019s arguments \nis to be found in the interior of a red-figure drinking cup (Rome, \nMus. Villa Giulia, inv. 3591) discovered in the \nEtrurian city of Falerii and dated to the mid-fifth century B.C.E. It \ndepicts a heroic figure racing nimbly ahead of a large tortoise and \nhas every appearance of being the first known \u201cresponse\u201d \nto the Achilles paradox.\n\n\nPlato\u2019s Parmenides depicts Socrates going as a young man to \nhear Zeno reading from the famous book he has brought to Athens for \nthe first time. Parmenides himself and some others, including \nPythodorus (the dramatic source of Plato\u2019s report) are portrayed as \nentering toward the end of the reading so that they hear only a \nlittle of Zeno\u2019s recitation. Plato then presents an exchange between \nSocrates and Zeno, the first part of which is as follows:\n\n\nOnce Socrates had heard it, he asked Zeno to read the first hypothesis\nof the first argument again, and, after it was read, he said:\n\u201cWhat do you mean by this, Zeno? \u2018If the things that are\nare many, that then they must be both like and unlike, but this is\nimpossible. For neither can unlike things be like, nor like things\nunlike\u2019? Is this not what you say?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d\nsaid Zeno. \u201cThen if it is impossible both for things unlike to\nbe like and for like things to be unlike, then it\u2019s also impossible\nfor there to be many things? For if there were many things, they would\nincur impossibilities. So is this what your arguments intend, nothing\nother than to maintain forcibly, contrary to everything normally said,\nthat there are not many things? And do you think that each of your\narguments is a proof of this very point, so that you consider yourself\nto be furnishing just as many proofs that there are not many things as\nthe arguments you have written? Is this what you say, or do I not\nunderstand correctly?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Zeno,\n\u201cbut you have understood perfectly well what the treatise as a\nwhole intends\u201d (Pl. Prm. 127d6\u2013128a3).\n\n\nWhile the dialogue\u2019s scenario, and thus this exchange, are clearly \nfictional, this passage is nonetheless normally taken as indicating \nthat Zeno composed a single treatise comprising numerous arguments, \ncast in the form of antinomies, all purporting to demonstrate the \nuntenability of the commonsense presumption that there are many \nthings. \n\n\nWhile the later tradition unreliably ascribes other works to Zeno, \nthere is some interesting evidence in the commentary on the \nParmenides by the Athenian Neoplatonist Proclus (5th c. \nC.E.) that he was familiar with a work transmitted under Zeno\u2019s name \ncontaining forty arguments or logoi (Procl. in Prm.\n694, 17\u201318 Steel). Much of what Proclus says about Zeno in his \ncommentary simply recasts what is already present in the above \nexchange, but this comment that this work of Zeno\u2019s contained forty \narguments, taken with certain other things he says, suggests that \nProclus had access to a work with some sort of Zenonian pedigree, a \nwork known to earlier commentators as well (as evidenced by Procl. \nin Prm. 630.26ff., especially 631.25\u2013632.3). If there was a \nwork available in later antiquity entitled The Forty Arguments of\nZeno, it is however unlikely to have been a fair replica of any \noriginal treatise of Zeno\u2019s. In the first place, some of Proclus\u2019 \napparent references to this work suggest that it fathered upon Zeno \narguments akin to some of those in Parmenides\u2019 own elaborate \ndialectical exercise later in the Parmenides. Furthermore, \nAristotle implies that people were reworking Zeno\u2019s arguments soon \nafter they were first propounded. In Physics 8.8, after \ngiving a basic reconstruction of the so-called Stadium paradox (see \nbelow, sect. 2.2.1) recalling its presentation in Physics \n6.9, Aristotle then notes that some propound the same argument in a \ndifferent way; the alternative reconstruction he then describes \n(Arist. Ph. 8.8, 263a7\u201311) is in effect a new \nversion of the original argument.\n\n\nReturning to the Parmenides passage, it should also be noted\nthat Socrates\u2019 description of Zeno\u2019s book, which Plato has Zeno \nendorse, indicates that its arguments had a certain structure and \npurpose. Specifically, the passage indicates that all Zeno\u2019s \narguments opposed the common-sense assumption that there are many \nthings. It might also suggest that these arguments took the form of \nantinomies like the one Socrates specifically cites, so that the \ngeneral pattern of Zeno\u2019s argumentation would have been: if there are\nmany things, these must be both F and not-F; but \nthings cannot be both F and not-F; therefore, it \ncannot be the case that there are many things. Although this \ndescription has inspired some to attempt to accommodate the extant \nparadoxes (of motion, plurality, and place) within a unified \narchitecture that would have provided the plan for Zeno\u2019s original \nbook, if in fact he wrote only one, none of these attempts have \nproved convincing. Since Plato\u2019s description is in a number of \nrespects difficult to square with what we know from other sources of \nZeno\u2019s actual arguments, one should be wary of making it the basis \nfor hypotheses regarding the book\u2019s plan of organization. For one \nthing, the paradoxes of motion reported by Aristotle do not evidently\ntarget the assumption that there are many things, nor do they take \nthe form of antinomies. Moreover, only one of the arguments against \nplurality elsewhere reported, the antinomy of limited and unlimited, \nconforms to the pattern of argumentation exemplified in the antinomy \nof like and unlike described by Plato\u2019s Socrates (see below, 2.1.1). \nThe remaining argument, the antinomy of large and small (see 2.1.2), \npurports to show not only that the assumption that there are many \nthings leads to an apparent contradiction, but, rather more \nambitiously, it purports to reduce each of the contradictory \nconsequences to absurdity. Plato does not actually state, of course, \nthat all Zeno\u2019s arguments took the form of antinomies. In the end, if\nthe characterization of Zeno\u2019s treatise by Plato\u2019s Socrates in the \npassage above is not quite accurate, there remains no more plausible \nview from antiquity regarding the general thrust of his arguments, to\nthe extent that there may have been a single one. One can, moreover, \neasily broaden Socrates\u2019 specification of the target to encompass the\narguments against motion and place by changing it to the slightly \nmore complex thesis that there are many things that move from place \nto place. Socrates might easily have been taking it for granted that,\nfor Zeno, such motion goes along automatically with plurality. What \nwe know of Zeno\u2019s arguments certainly accords with the notion that \nthey were meant to challenge ordinary assumptions about plurality and\nmotion. His arguments are quite literally \n\u201cpara-doxes\u201d\u2014from the Greek para \n(\u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201cagainst\u201d) and \ndoxa (\u201cbelief\u201d or \n\u201copinion\u201d)\u2014arguments for conclusions contrary to \nwhat people ordinarily believe. What more there might be to say about\nZeno\u2019s purposes will be discussed below, after presentation of what \nwe know of his actual arguments.\n2. The Extant Paradoxes\n\n\nThe task of reconstructing Zeno\u2019s arguments is sometimes \ninsufficiently distinguished from the task of developing responses to\nthem. How one reconstructs Zeno\u2019s reasoning certainly determines to \nsome extent what will constitute an effective response. The danger is\nthat one\u2019s idea of how to formulate an effective response may affect \none\u2019s reconstruction of Zeno\u2019s actual reasoning, particularly if one \nimports into his arguments concepts more developed or precise than \nthe ones with which he was actually operating. In some cases, as with\nthe one called the Achilles, the paradox\u2019s power derives to a \nsignificant extent from the very simplicity of the notions it \ndeploys. The reconstructions provided here therefore aim to preserve \nsomething of the manner of Zeno\u2019s own argumentation as we know it \nfrom verbatim quotation of at least portions of some of the preserved\nparadoxes. More formal reconstructions are possible and available. As\nalready noted, at least one effort at improving Zeno\u2019s argumentation \nwas already known to Aristotle. But such efforts can come at the cost\nof historical accuracy, which is the primary goal of this article. \nHow it might be possible to improve Zeno\u2019s arguments will be left to \nothers. Since it is also essential to appreciate just how much (or \nhow little) we know of Zeno\u2019s arguments, the primary evidence for \neach major argument is presented along with a reconstruction.\n2.1 The Arguments Against Plurality\n2.1.1 The Antinomy of Limited and Unlimited\n\n\nIn his commentary on book 1 of Aristotle\u2019s Physics, the\nAlexandrian Neoplatonist Simplicius (6th c. C.E.) quotes verbatim\nZeno\u2019s argument that if there are many things, they are limited and\nunlimited, as follows: \u201cIf there are many things, it is\nnecessary that they be just so many as they are and neither greater\nthan themselves nor fewer. But if they are just as many as they are,\nthey will be limited. If there are many things, the things that are\nare unlimited; for there are always others between these entities, and\nagain others between those. And thus the things that are are\nunlimited\u201d (Zeno fr. 3 DK, i.e., Simp. in\nPh. 140.29\u201333 Diels). This is the only Zenonian antinomy\nthat has the appearance of being preserved in its entirety.\n\n\nThe argument here may be reconstructed as follows. Its overall \nstructure is: If there are many things, then there must be finitely \nmany things; and if there are many things, then there must be \ninfinitely many things. The assumption that there are many things is \nthus supposed to have been shown to lead to contradiction, namely, \nthat things are both finitely and infinitely many. The particular \nargument for the first arm of the antinomy seems to be simply: If \nthere are many things, then they must be just so many as they are. If\nthe many things are just so many as they are, they must be finitely \nmany. Therefore, if there are many things, then there must be \nfinitely many things. Simplicius somewhat loosely describes the \nantinomy\u2019s second arm as demonstrating numerical infinity through \ndichotomy (Simp. in Ph. 140.33\u20134). In fact, the argument \ndepends on a postulate specifying a necessary condition upon two \nthings being distinct, rather than on division per se, and \nit may be reconstructed as follows: If there are many things, they \nmust be distinct, that is, separate from one another. Postulate: Any \ntwo things will be distinct or separate from one another only if \nthere is some other thing between them. Two representative things, \nx1 and x2, will be distinct \nonly if there is some other thing, x3, between \nthem. In turn, x1 and x3 will\nbe distinct only if there is some other thing, \nx4, between them. Since the postulate can be \nrepeatedly applied in this manner unlimited times, between any two \ndistinct things there will be limitlessly many other things. \nTherefore, if there are many things, then there must be limitlessly \nmany things.\n2.1.2 The  Antinomy of Large and Small\n\n\nIn the same stretch of his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s \nPhysics, Simplicius reports at length one of Zeno\u2019s numerous\narguments designed to show how the claim that there are many things \nleads to contradiction. \u201cOne of these,\u201d Simplicius says, \n\u201cis the argument in which he demonstrates that if there are \nmany things, they are both large and small: so large as to be \nunlimited in magnitude, and so small as to have no magnitude. Indeed,\nin this argument he shows that what has neither magnitude nor \nthickness nor bulk would not even exist. \u2018For if\u2019, he \nsays, \u2018it were added to another entity, it would not make it \nany larger; for since it is of no magnitude, when it is added, there \ncannot be any increase in magnitude. And so what was added would just\nbe nothing. But if when it is taken away the other thing will be no \nsmaller, and again when it is added the other thing will not \nincrease, it is clear that what was added and what was taken away was\nnothing\u2019\u201d (Zeno fr. 2 DK = Simp. in Ph. \n139.7\u201315). After thus quoting this portion of the argument, \nSimplicius continues: \u201cZeno says this because each of the many \nthings has magnitude and is infinite [reading apeiron \ninstead of ms. apeir\u00f4n], given that something is \nalways in front of whatever is taken, in virtue of infinite division;\nthis he shows after first demonstrating that none have magnitude on \nthe grounds that each of the many is the same as itself and \none\u201d (Simp. in Ph. 139.16\u201319). Soon after this, \nSimplicius records the argument for unlimited magnitude he has \nalluded to in the first part of the passage just quoted, as follows: \n\u201cInfinity in respect of magnitude he earlier proves in the same\nway. For having first shown that, if what is does not have magnitude,\nit would not even exist, he continues: \u2018But if it is, each must\nhave some magnitude and thickness, and one part of it must extend \naway from another. And the same account applies to the part out \nahead. For that part too will have magnitude and will have part of it\nout ahead. Indeed, it is the same to say this once as always to keep \nsaying it; for no such part of it will be last, nor will one part not\nbe related to another. Thus if there are many things, they must be \nboth small and large, so small as to have no magnitude, and so large \nas to be unlimited\u2019\u201d (Zeno fr. 1 DK, = Simp. in \nPh. 140.34\u2013141.8). \n\n\nSimplicius only alludes to Zeno\u2019s argument for smallness, without \nsetting it out: he says that Zeno derived the conclusion that \n\u201cnone have magnitude on the grounds that each of the many is \nthe same as itself and one.\u201d Although this is not much to go \non, the argument may plausibly be reconstructed as follows. Each of \nthe many is the same as itself and one. Whatever has magnitude can be\ndivided into distinguishable parts; whatever has distinguishable \nparts is not everywhere the same as itself; thus, whatever has \nmagnitude is not everywhere, and so is not genuinely, the same as \nitself. Whatever is not the same as itself is not genuinely one. \nThus, whatever has magnitude is not genuinely one. Therefore, each of\nthe many has no magnitude. The basic assumption here is that to be \n\u201cthe same as itself\u201d is what it means for something to be\n\u201cone\u201d in the strict sense Zeno envisages, whereas any \nmagnitude, which will have distinguishable parts in virtue of being \nspatially extended, will fail to be strictly one and self-identical. \n\n\nThe evidence in Simplicius indicates that Zeno then transitioned to \nthe antinomy\u2019s other arm, the unlimited largeness of things, via the \nfollowing lemma: since what has no magnitude would be nothing, each \nof the many must have some magnitude. Simplicius\u2019s report of how Zeno\nspecifically argued for the second arm\u2019s conclusion, that each of the\nmany is of unlimited magnitude, pertains primarily to its apparent \nsub-argument for the interim conclusion that each thing has \nlimitlessly many parts, which ran as follows. Each of the many has \nsome magnitude and thickness (from the lemma). Whatever has some \nmagnitude and thickness will have (distinguishable) parts, so that \neach of the many will have parts. If x is one of the many, \nthen x will have parts. Since each of these parts of \nx has some magnitude and thickness, each of these parts will\nhave its own parts, and these parts will in turn have parts of their \nown, and so on, and so on, without limit. Thus each of the many will \nhave a limitless number of parts. Whether or not Zeno then made \nexplicit how the antinomy\u2019s final conclusion followed from this, here\nis a plausible reconstruction of the rest of the reasoning was \npresumably supposed to go: Every part of each thing has some \nmagnitude; the magnitude of any object is equal to the sum of the \nmagnitudes of its parts; and the sum of limitlessly many parts of \nsome magnitude is a limitless magnitude. Therefore, the magnitude of \neach of the many is limitless. \n\n\nTaken as a whole, then, this elaborate tour de force of an \nargument purports to have shown that, if there are many things, each \nof them must have simultaneously no magnitude and unlimited \nmagnitude.\n2.2 The Paradoxes of Motion\n\n\nAristotle is most concerned with Zeno in Physics 6, the book\ndevoted to the theory of the continuum. In Physics 6.9, \nAristotle states that Zeno had four arguments concerning motion that \nare difficult to resolve, gives a summary paraphrase of each, and \noffers his own analysis. The ancient commentators on this chapter \nprovide little additional information. Thus reconstruction of these \nfamous arguments rests almost exclusively on Aristotle\u2019s incomplete \npresentation. Note that Aristotle\u2019s remarks leave open the \npossibility that there were other Zenonian arguments against motion \nthat he deemed less difficult to resolve. More importantly, \nAristotle\u2019s presentation gives no indication of how these four \narguments might have functioned within the kind of dialectical scheme\nindicated by Plato\u2019s Parmenides.\n2.2.1 The Stadium, or The Dichotomy\n\n\n\u201cFirst,\u201d Aristotle says, \u201cthere is the argument \nabout its being impossible to move because what moves must reach the \nhalf-way point earlier than the end\u201d (Ph. \n6.9, 239b11\u201313). He says no more about this argument here \nbut alludes to his earlier discussion of it in Physics 6.2, \nwhere, after arguing that both time and magnitude are continuous, he \nasserts: \u201cTherefore the argument of Zeno falsely presumes that \nit is not possible to traverse or make contact with unlimited things \nindividually in a limited time\u201d (233a21\u20133). \nSubsequently, in Physics 8.8, he again raises the question \nof how to respond \u201cto those posing the question of Zeno\u2019s \nargument, if one must always pass through the half-way point, and \nthese are unlimited, and it is impossible to traverse things \nunlimited\u201d (263a4\u20136), and he proceeds to offer what \nhe claims is a more adequate solution than the one presented in \nPhysics 6.2. The argument Aristotle is alluding to in these \npassages gets its name from his mention in Topics 8.8 of \n\u201cZeno\u2019s argument that it is not possible to move or to traverse\nthe stadium\u201d as a prime example of an argument opposed to \ncommon belief yet difficult to resolve (160b7\u20139).\n\n\nThe following reconstruction attempts to remain true to this evidence\nand thus to capture something of how Zeno may originally have argued.\nFor anyone (S) to traverse the finite distance across a \nstadium from p0 to p1 within \na limited amount of time, S must first reach the point half \nway between p0 and p1, namely\np2. \n\n\n\n\n\nBefore S reaches p2, S must \nfirst reach the point half way between p0 and \np2, namely p3. Again, before \nS reaches p3, S must first \nreach the point half way between p0 and \np3, namely p4. There is a \nhalf way point again to be reached between p0 and\np4. In fact, there is always another half way \npoint that must be reached before reaching any given half way point, \nso that the number of half way points that must be reached between \nany pn and any pn-1 is \nunlimited. But it is impossible for S to reach an unlimited \nnumber of half way points within a limited amount of time. Therefore,\nit is impossible for S to traverse the stadium or, indeed, \nfor S to move at all; in general, it is impossible to move \nfrom one place to another.\n2.2.2 The Achilles\n\n\nImmediately after his brief presentation of the Stadium, Aristotle \nintroduces the most famous of Zeno\u2019s paradoxes of motion, that of \nAchilles and the Tortoise: \u201cSecond is the one called \n\u2018Achilles\u2019: this is that the slowest runner never will be\novertaken by the fastest; for it is necessary for the one chasing to \ncome first to where the one fleeing started from, so that it is \nnecessary for the slower runner always to be ahead some\u201d \n(Ph. 6.9, 239b14\u201318). Simplicius adds the \nidentification of the slowest runner as the tortoise (in Ph.\n1014, 5). Aristotle remarks that this argument is merely a variation \non the Dichotomy, with the difference that it does not depend on \ndividing in half the distance taken (Ph. 6.9, \n239b18\u201320), and his analysis, such as it is, emphasizes \nthat this paradox is to be resolved in the same way as the first \nparadox of motion. Whether this is actually the case is debatable.\n\nIf a tortoise starts ahead of Achilles in a race, the tortoise will\nnever be overtaken by Achilles. Let the start of the race be\nrepresented as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the time it takes Achilles to reach the point from which the \ntortoise started (t0), the tortoise will have \nprogressed some distance (d1) beyond that point, \nnamely to t1, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, during the time it then takes Achilles to reach the new \npoint the tortoise has reached (t1), the tortoise\nwill have progressed some new distance (d2) \nbeyond the tortoise\u2019s new starting point, namely to \nt2, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tortoise will again have progressed some further distance \n(d3) beyond t2, namely to \nt3, in the time it takes Achilles to move from \na2(=t1) to \na3(=t2). In fact, during the \ntime it takes Achilles to reach the tortoise\u2019s location at the \nbeginning of that time, the tortoise will always have moved some \ndistance ahead, so that every time Achilles reaches the tortoise\u2019s \nnew starting point, the tortoise will be ahead some. Therefore, the \nslowest runner in the race, the tortoise, will never be overtaken by \nthe fastest runner, Achilles.\n2.2.3 The Arrow\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of the relation of motion and time in \nPhysics 6.8 prepares the way for his objection to the \nZenonian paradox of motion he mentions at the very beginning of \nPhysics 6.9: \u201cZeno reasons fallaciously; for he says \nthat if every thing always is resting whenever it is against what is \nequal, and what moves is always in the now, then the moving arrow is \nmotionless\u201d (Ph. 6.9, 239b5\u20137). Aristotle \nremarks that Zeno relies on the false supposition that time is \ncomposed of indivisible \u201cnows\u201d or instants \n(b8\u20139), a point he soon repeats in identifying the \nargument purporting to show that \u201cthe moving arrow is standing \nstill\u201d as the third of Zeno\u2019s paradoxes of motion \n(b30\u20133). In his Life of Pyrrho, Diogenes Laertius\nreports, \u201cZeno abolishes motion, saying, \u2018What moves \nmoves neither in the place it is nor in a place it is not\u201d \n(D.L. 9.72 = Zeno B4 DK; cf. Epiphanius, Against the \nHeretics 3.11). This report, which Diels and Kranz took to \npreserve a genuine fragment of Zeno\u2019s book, appears to suggest how \nthe argument that the moving arrow is at rest may have figured as \npart of a broader argument against motion. Diogenes, however, is not \na particularly good source for Zeno\u2019s arguments: his Life of \nZeno notes only that he was the first to propound the \n\u201cAchilles\u201d argument, along with many others (D.L. 9.29). \nIt is just as likely, therefore, that Diogenes\u2019 report depends \non an intervening attempt to couch the paradoxes of motion reported \nby Aristotle in the dilemmatic form Plato indicates was typical of \nZenonian argumentation.\n\n\nEven if Diogenes\u2019 report happens to be reliable, we still must rely \non Aristotle in trying to reconstruct the argument that, as in \nDiogenes\u2019 report, what moves does not move in the place where it is. \n(We get no indication from him of any argument of Zeno\u2019s to show that\nwhat moves does not move where it is not; perhaps that was thought \nself-evident.) And Aristotle\u2019s evidence in this instance is an even \nmore meager basis for reconstruction than usual. Thus, according to \nAristotle, the moving arrow (A) is actually standing still. \nThe argument for this conclusion seems to be as follows: What moves \nis always, throughout the duration of its motion, in the now, that is\nto say, in one instant of time after another. So, throughout its \nflight, A is in one instant of time after another. At any \nparticular instant during its flight (t), A \noccupies a place exactly equivalent to its length, that is, \nA is \u201cagainst what is equal.\u201d But whatever is \nagainst what is equal is resting. So A is resting at \nt. But t is no different than the other instants \nduring A\u2018s flight, so that what is the case with \nA at t is the case with A at every other \ninstant of its flight. Thus A is resting at every instant of\nits flight, and this amounts to the moving arrow always being \nmotionless or standing still.\n2.2.4.\u00a0The Moving Rows\n\n\n\u201cFourth,\u201d Aristotle says, \u201cis the one about the\nthings in the stadium moving from opposite directions, being of equal\nbulk, alongside things of equal size, with some moving from the end of\nthe stadium and some from the middle, at equal speed, in which case he\nsupposes it turns out that half the time is equal to its double\u201d\n(Ph. 6.9, 239b33\u2013240a1).\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s ensuing discussion of what he takes to be Zeno\u2019s mistakes\nis based on an exempli gratia scenario normally taken as a\nbasis for reconstruction, as it is here. \u201cFor example,\u201d\nAristotle says, \u201clet the resting equal masses be those marked\nAA, let those\nmarked BB be beginning from the middle, being\nequal in number and size to these, and let those marked\nCC be beginning from the end, being equal in\nnumber and size to these, and moving at the same speed as\nthe Bs\u201d (Arist. Ph.  6.9,\n240a4\u20138). \n\n\n\n\nA\u00a0A\u00a0A\u00a0A\nB\u00a0B\u00a0B\u00a0B\n\u2192\n\u2190\nC\u00a0C\u00a0C\u00a0C\n\n\nDiagram 1\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nA\u00a0A\u00a0A\u00a0A\nB\u00a0B\u00a0B\u00a0B\nC\u00a0C\u00a0C\u00a0C\n\nDiagram 2\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram 1 represents a plausible way of understanding what Aristotle\nenvisages as the starting position in Zeno\u2019s paradox, even though his\ndescription of this position is somewhat underdetermined. Aristotle\ncontinues: \u201cIt follows that the\nleading B and the\nleading C are at the end at the same time,\nonce they move past one another\u201d\n(240a9\u201310). This description suggests a final\nposition as represented in Diagram 2. Since we have no other\nindication of how Zeno himself thought he could derive the conclusion\nAristotle reports, that \u201chalf the time is equal to its\ndouble,\u201d from the description of this situation, we have to rely\non Aristotle for this as well: \u201cIt follows,\u201d Aristotle\nsays, \u201cthat the [leading] C has gone\npast all [the Bs], while the\n[leading] B has gone past half\n[the As], so that the time is half; for each\nof the two is alongside each other for an equal amount of time. But it\nalso follows that the leading B has gone past\nall the\nCs; for the leading C\nand the leading B will be at the opposite ends\nat the same time, because both are alongside\nthe As for an equal time\u201d\n(204a10\u201317). Apparently, Zeno somehow meant to infer\nfrom the fact that the leading B moves past\ntwo As in the same time it moves past all\nfour Cs that half the time is equal to its\ndouble. The challenge is to develop from this less than startling fact\nanything more than a facile appearance of paradox. Since it is\nstressed that all the bodies are of the same size and that the moving\nbodies move at the same speed, Zeno would appear to have relied on\nsome such postulate as that a body in motion proceeding at constant\nspeed will move past bodies of the same size in the same amount of\ntime. He could have argued that in the time it takes all\nthe Cs to move past all\nthe Bs, the leading B\nmoves past two As or goes two lengths, and the\nleading B also moves past\nfour Cs or goes four lengths. According to the\npostulate, then, the time the leading B\ntravels must be the same as half the time it travels. Unfortunately,\nthe evidence for this particular paradox does not enable us to\ndetermine just how Zeno may in fact have argued. Aristotle thinks the\nargument depends upon a transparent falsehood, and one must therefore\nkeep in mind, if it seems he was right, that Aristotle\u2019s presentation\nand reconstruction may itself be colored by his desire to bear out his\naccusation.\n2.3 Other Paradoxes\n\n\nAristotle also gestures toward two additional ingenious arguments by \nZeno, versions of which were also known to Simplicius.\n2.3.1 The Millet Seed\n\n\n\u201cZeno\u2019s argument is not correct, that any portion of millet \nseed whatsoever makes a sound\u201d (Arist. Ph. \n7.5, 250a20\u20131). The version of this argument known to \nSimplicius represents Zeno as engaged in a fictional argument with \nProtagoras, wherein he makes the point that if a large number of \nmillet seeds makes a sound (for example, when poured out in a heap), \nthen one seed or even one ten-thousandth of a seed should also make \nits own sound (for example, in that process) (Simp. in Ph. \n1108.18\u201328). Aristotle\u2019s report is too slight a basis for \nreconstructing how Zeno may in fact have argued, and Simplicius is \nevidently reporting some later reworking. The evidence nonetheless \nsuggests that Zeno anticipated reasoning related to that of the \nsorites paradox, apparently invented more than a century later.\n2.3.2 A Paradox of Place\n\n\nToward the end of the introduction to his analysis of place, \nAristotle notes that \u201cZeno\u2019s difficulty requires some \nexplanation; for if every thing that is is in a place, it is clear \nthat there will also be a place of the place, and so on to \ninfinity\u201d (Arist. Ph. 4.1, 209a23\u20135). His \nsubsequent statement of the problem is even briefer but adds one key \npoint: \u201cZeno raises the problem that, if place is something, it\nwill be in something\u201d (Arist. Ph. \n4.3, 210b22\u20133; cf. Eudemus fr. 78 Wehrli, [Arist.] De \nMelisso Xenophane Gorgia 979b23\u20137, Simp. in \nPh. 562, 3\u20136). Zeno would appear to have argued as follows. \nEverything that is is in something, namely a place. If a place is \nsomething, then it too must be in something, namely some further \nplace. If this second place is something, it must be in yet another \nplace; and the same reasoning applies to this and each successive \nplace ad infinitum. Thus, if there is such a thing as place,\nthere must be limitless places everywhere, which is absurd. \nTherefore, there is no such thing as place. This argument could well \nhave formed part of a more elaborate argument against the view that \nthere are many things, such as that if there are many things, they \nmust be somewhere, i.e. in some place; but there is no such thing as \nplace and thus no place for the many to be; therefore, there are not \nmany things. This is, however, only speculation.\n3. Zeno\u2019s Purposes\n\n\nThe commonly found claim that Zeno aimed to defend the paradoxical \nmonism of his Eleatic mentor, Parmenides, is based upon the \nspeculations by the young Socrates of Plato\u2019s Parmenides on \nZeno\u2019s ulterior motives. After the portion of the exchange between \nSocrates and Zeno quoted above (sect. 1), Socrates turns to \nParmenides and says:\n\n\nIn a way, he has written the same thing as you, but he\u2019s changed it\naround to try to fool us into thinking that he\u2019s saying something\ndifferent. For you say in the verses you\u2019ve composed that the all is\none, and you do a fine and good job of providing proofs of this. He,\non the other hand, says there are not many things, and he too provides\nnumerous and powerful proofs. Given that one says \u201cone\u201d\nand the other \u201cnot many,\u201d and that each speaks in this way\nso as to appear to have said none of the same things, when you are in\nfact saying virtually the same thing, what you\u2019ve said seems said in a\nway that\u2019s beyond the powers of the rest of\nus. (Pl. Prm. 128a6\u2013b6)\n\n\nSocrates virtually accuses Zeno of having plotted with Parmenides to \nconceal the fundamental identity of their conclusions. With so many \nreaders of Plato accustomed to taking Socrates as his mouthpiece in \nthe dialogues, it is not surprising that this passage has served as \nthe foundation for the common view of Zeno as Parmenidean legatee and\ndefender, by his own special means, of Eleatic orthodoxy. \nUnfortunately, this use of the Platonic evidence is unjustifiably \nselective, even prejudicial, in the weight it accords the words put \nin Socrates\u2019 mouth. Plato immediately has Zeno disabuse Socrates of \nhis suspicions about the book\u2019s ulterior purpose. \n\n\nZeno this time replies that Socrates has not altogether grasped the \ntruth about his book. First, he says, the book had nothing like the \npretensions Socrates has ascribed to it (Prm. 128c2\u20135). Zeno\nis made to explain his actual motivation as follows:\n\n\nThe treatise is in truth a sort of support for Parmenides\u2019 doctrine\nagainst those attempting to ridicule it on the ground that, if one is,\nthe doctrine suffers many ridiculous consequences that contradict it.\nThis treatise, therefore, argues against those who say the many are,\nand it pays them back with the same results and worse, intending to\ndemonstrate that their hypothesis \u201cif many are\u201d suffers\neven more ridiculous consequences than the hypothesis of there being\none, if one pursues the issue sufficiently. (Pl. Prm.\n128c6\u2013d6)\n\n\nZeno\u2019s account of how he defended Parmenides against those who \nridiculed him is designed to correct Socrates\u2019 mistaken impression \nthat Zeno was basically just arguing for the same thing as \nParmenides, that the all is one. Zeno is portrayed as trying to \ncorrect this mistaken view of his purposes as born of a superficial \nunderstanding of Parmenides\u2019 doctrine. Zeno\u2019s arguments against \nplurality will seem to entail Parmenides\u2019 doctrine only if his \nthesis, \u201cone is\u201d (hen esti), is taken to mean \nthat only one thing exists. However, the elaborate examination of \nthis very thesis, \u201cone is\u201d (hen esti), by \nParmenides himself in the latter part of the dialogue shows that \nPlato thinks it is not to be understood in any such trivial sense. \nFor not only does Parmenides end up examining the relation of his One\nto other things, which would have been impossible if his doctrine \nentailed their non-existence, but the relation other things have to \nthe One actually proves responsible in a way for their existence. \nZeno cannot be supposing that his arguments against plurality \nentailed the doctrine of Parmenides when that doctrine is represented\nin this same dialogue by Parmenides himself as something altogether \nmore involved than the simple thesis that only one thing exists. \nNevertheless, Zeno\u2019s description of the persons who attempted to \nridicule Parmenides is perfectly compatible with their \nhaving understood the thesis, \u201cone is\u201d (hen \nesti), as an assertion that only one thing exists. Zeno\u2019s \narguments constitute an indirect defense of \nParmenides\u2014\u201ca sort of support\u201d (bo\u00eatheia \ntis, 128c6)\u2014because they do nothing to disabuse his \ndetractors of their superficial understanding of his doctrine. \nInstead, as Zeno says, he tried to show that the assumption that \nthere are many things has consequences every bit as unpalatable as \nthose Parmenides\u2019 critics suppose his position has (cf. Procl. in\nPrm. 619.15\u201321). Thus, while Zeno accepts Socrates\u2019 point that \nhis own arguments aim to show that there are not many things, he \ncorrects Socrates\u2019 impression that, in arguing this point, he was \njust saying the same thing as Parmenides in a different form. \n\n\nThe evidence of Plato\u2019s Parmenides, then, does not license \nthe conventional view that Zeno\u2019s arguments against plurality and \nmotion were intended to support the strict monism of Parmenides. \nClaims to the contrary have rested upon selective and prejudicial use\nof this evidence due to the tendency to privilege Socrates\u2019 remarks \non Zeno\u2019s purposes over Zeno\u2019s own qualifications and corrections of \nthat analysis. What Plato actually suggests is that Zeno aimed to \nshow those whose superficial understanding of Parmenides had led them\nto charge him with flying in the face of common sense, that common \nsense views concerning unity and plurality are themselves riddled \nwith latent contradictions. Such is, essentially, the judgment of \nJonathan Barnes: \u201cZeno was not a systematic Eleatic solemnly \ndefending Parmenides against philosophical attack by a profound and \ninterconnected set of reductive argumentations. Many men had mocked \nParmenides: Zeno mocked the mockers. His logoi were designed\nto reveal the inanities and ineptitudes inherent in the ordinary \nbelief in a plural world; he wanted to startle, to amaze, to \ndisconcert. He did not have the serious metaphysical purpose of \nsupporting an Eleatic monism\u201d (Barnes 1982, 236). However, \nwhether the historical Zeno was actually involved in anything like \nthe dialectical context Plato envisages for him must remain \nuncertain. Even if there were already in Zeno\u2019s day individuals who \nmistook Parmenides\u2019 position for the thesis that only one thing \nexists, the idea that Zeno\u2019s arguments were motivated by a desire to \nrespond to such individuals in kind is as historically unverifiable \nas the claim Plato puts in his mouth that his book was stolen and \ncirculated before he could decide for himself whether to make his \narguments public (Pl. Prm. 128d7\u2013e1). \n\n\nNevertheless, just as Socrates\u2019 initial remark that Zeno\u2019s \narguments were all designed to show that there are not in fact many \nthings remains basically plausible, so there are elements in Zeno\u2019s \naccount of his own purposes that have the ring of historical truth \nand that square well with other evidence. Plato has Zeno continue his\nsecond response to Socrates (quoted above) by saying, \u201cIt was \nwritten by me in such a contentious spirit when I was still young. \n\u2026 You are mistaken in this regard, then, Socrates, that you suppose\nit was written, not under the influence of youthful contentiousness, \nbut under that of a more mature ambition\u201d (Pl. Prm. \n128d6\u2013e3). The point is repeatedly made that Zeno\u2019s book was written \nin a spirit of youthful contentiousness or \u201clove of \nvictory\u201d (philonikia, Prm. 128d7, e2). The \nmore mature Zeno seems a little embarrassed by the combative manner \nevident in the arguments of his younger days, as well he might since \nthat spirit would have come to be seen as typical of the eristic \ncontroversialists who sprang up in the sophistic era. Plato gives yet\nanother nod to the idea that Zeno was a forerunner of eristic \ncontentiousness when he has him say that his book \u201ccontradicts \n(antilegei) those who say the many are\u201d (Prm.\n128d2\u20133). This suggestion that Zeno was a practitioner of what came \nto be known as \u201cantilogic,\u201d or the art of contradiction, \nis consistent with Plato\u2019s representation of him in other dialogues \nas something of a sophist. In the Alcibiades, Socrates \nreports that Pythodorus and Callias each paid Zeno a hundred minae to\nbecome clever and skilled in argument (Alc. 119a3\u20136; cf. \nPrm. 126b\u2013c). Teaching for payment is of course one hallmark\nof the professional educators who styled themselves experts in \nwisdom. That Plato saw Zeno as a practitioner of the specific brand \nof argument known as antilogic is evidenced by the \nPhaedrus\u2019s famous description of him as the \n\u201cEleatic Palamedes\u201d for his ability to make the same \nthings appear to his audience both like and unlike, one and many, \nmoving and at rest (Phdr. 261d6\u20138). Again, at the beginning \nof the Sophist, when Theodorus introduces the Eleatic \nVisitor as an associate of Parmenides and Zeno and their followers, \nSocrates expresses concern that the Visitor may be \u201csome god of\nrefutation\u201d until Theodorus reassures him that the Visitor is \nmore moderate than those who spend their time in eristic and \ncompetitive disputation (Sph. 216a\u2013b). Plato\u2019s references \nthus consistently connect Zeno with the rise of eristic disputation, \nand it is perfectly plausible that his arguments against plurality \nand motion would have been well-known examples of making the weaker \ncase seem the stronger. \n\n\nThe portrait of Zeno and his tactics that emerges from Plato\u2019s \nreferences makes it seem natural that Aristotle, in one of his lost \ndialogues, entitled Sophist, spoke of Zeno as the inventor \nof dialectic (D.L. 8.57; cf. 9.25; S.E. M. 7.7). Precisely \nwhat Aristotle meant by this remains a matter of speculation, given \nthat Aristotle also attributes the invention of dialectic to Socrates\n(Arist. Metaph. M.4, 1078b25\u201330) and to Plato \n(Metaph. A.6, 987b31\u20133); he says he himself \ninvented the theory of it (SE \n34, 183b34\u2013184b8). There is also the question of\nwhether Aristotle viewed Zeno\u2019s arguments as more eristic than \nproperly dialectical. The difference, according to Aristotle, is that\ndialectical arguments proceed from endoxa or \u201cviews \nheld by everyone or by most people or by the wise, that is, by all, \nmost, or the especially famous and respected of the wise,\u201d \nwhereas eristic arguments proceed from what only seem to be, or what \nseems to follow from, endoxa (Top. \n1.1, 100a29\u201330, b22\u20135). Aristotle clearly \nbelieves that some of Zeno\u2019s assumptions have only a specious \nplausibility (see Top. 8.8, 160b7\u20139, SE \n24, 279b17\u201321, Ph. 1.2, 233a21\u201331, \nMetaph. B.4.1001b13\u201316), so that they would\nby Aristotle\u2019s own criteria be examples of eristic rather than\nproperly dialectical arguments. For Aristotle, then, Zeno was a\ncontroversialist and paradox-monger, whose arguments were nevertheless\nboth sophisticated enough to qualify him as the inventor of dialectic\nand were important for forcing clarification of concepts fundamental\nto natural science. Aristotle\u2019s view of Zeno thus seems largely in\naccordance with Plato\u2019s portrayal of him as a master of the art of\ncontradiction. \n\n\nShould we then think of Zeno as a sophist? Certainly Isocrates, the \nrhetorician and contemporary of Plato, did not hesitate to lump \nGorgias, Zeno, and Melissus together as among the other \n\u201csophists\u201d flourishing in the era of Protagoras and all \nproducing tedious treatises advocating the most outrageous claims \n(Isoc. Hel. [Orat. 10] 2\u20133). While there are \ndifficulties in giving precise definition to the term \n\u201csophist,\u201d one feature common to those normally classed \nas such that Zeno lacks is an interest in the interrogation of \ncultural norms and values. Zeno\u2019s influence, however, on the great \nsophists who were his contemporaries and, more generally, on the \ntechniques of argumentation promulgated among the sophists seems \nundeniable. Protagoras\u2019 development of the techniques of antilogic, \nrooted in his claim that there are two opposed arguments on every \nmatter (D.L. 9.51), seems likely to have been inspired by Zeno\u2019s \nnovel forms of argumentation as well as by his advocacy of the most \ncounter-intuitive of theses. Zeno\u2019s influence is especially clear, \nmoreover, in Gorgias\u2019 treatise, \u201cOn Nature, or On What Is \nNot,\u201d both in its penchant for argumentation via antithesis and\nreductio and in its use of premises drawn straight from Zeno\nhimself (see [Arist.] MXG 979a23, b25,\nb37). It is even possible that the famous circle of \ncontemporary intellectuals the great Athenian statesman Pericles \ngathered around himself provided a major conduit for Zeno\u2019s impact on\nthe first generation of sophists. Plutarch, at any rate, records that\n\u201cPericles heard Zeno of Elea discoursing on nature in the \nmanner of Parmenides, and practicing a kind of skill in \ncross-examination and in driving one\u2019s opponent into a corner by \nmeans of contradictory argument\u201d (Plu. Per. 4.5). The \nskill Plutarch attributes to Zeno, still evident in the fragmentary \nremains of his arguments, is just the kind of skill in argument \nmanifested in a great deal of sophistic practice. Although doubts \nhave been raised about the reliability of Plutarch\u2019s report that \nZeno, like Damon and Anaxagoras, was one of the many contemporary \nintellectuals whose company was avidly pursued by Pericles, there is \nlittle that seriously tells against it. Thus George Kerferd has \nargued both that the patronage of Pericles and his keen interest in \nthe intellectual developments of his day must have been critically \nimportant to the sophistic movement and that Zeno\u2019s paradoxes were a \nprofound influence on the development of the sophistic method of \nantilogic, which he sees as \u201cperhaps the most characteristic \nfeature of the thought of the whole period\u201d (Kerferd 1981, \n18\u201323, 59ff., 85).\n\n\nThe evidence surveyed here suggests that Zeno\u2019s paradoxes were \ndesigned as provocative challenges to the common-sense view that our \nworld is populated by numerous things that move from place to place. \nHis apparent demonstrations of how the common-sense view is fraught \nwith contradiction made him an influential precursor of sophistic \nantilogic and eristic disputation. It is not surprising that someone \nlike Isocrates should have viewed Zeno as a sophist to be classed \nwith Protagoras and Gorgias. To ask whether Zeno was in fact a \nsophist, a practitioner of antilogic, an eristic controversialist, or\na proper dialectician is to some extent inappropriate, for these \ndesignations all acquired their normal meaning and range of \napplication only after Zeno\u2019s time. While he perhaps does not fit \nexactly into any of these categories, still his development of \nsophisticated methods of argumentation to produce apparent proofs of \nthe evidently false conclusions that motion is impossible and that \nthere are not in fact many things made it quite natural for Plato, \nAristotle, Isocrates, and others to refer to him under all these \nlabels. \n\n\nIt is remarkable that, while many of the responses to Zeno\u2019s \nparadoxes, and even some modern formulations of the paradoxes \nthemselves, depend on advanced mathematical techniques, Zeno\u2019s \noriginal arguments do not themselves appear to have involved any \nparticularly complicated mathematics. Several of the paradoxes \ninvolve no specifically mathematical notions at all. The Achilles is \nperhaps the best example since it employs only very ordinary notions,\nsuch as getting to where another has started from. The other extant \narguments for the most part deploy similarly prosaic notions: being \nsomewhere or being in a place, being in motion, moving past something\nelse, getting halfway there, being of some size, having parts, being \none, being like, being the same, and so on. Where Zeno seems to have \nleapt ahead of earlier thinkers is in deploying specifically \nquantitative concepts, most notably quantitative concepts of limit \n(peras) and the lack of limit (to apeiron). Earlier\nGreek thinkers had tended to speak of limitedness and unlimitedness \nin ways suggesting a qualitative rather than a quantitative notion. \nWhile one might suppose that Zeno\u2019s turn to a more strictly \nquantitative conception of limit and limitlessness could have been \ninspired by his familiarity with Pythagorean philosophers and \nmathematicians in Magna Graecia, we can in fact trace the philosophy \nof limiters and unlimiteds only back as far as Philolaus, a \nPythagorean roughly contemporary with Socrates and thus a good deal \nyounger than Zeno.\n\n\nWhatever may have spurred Zeno\u2019s development of his collection of \nparadoxes, his arguments quickly achieved a remarkable level of \nnotoriety. They had an immediate impact on Greek physical theory. \nZeno\u2019s powerful principle that any spatially extended entity must be \nlimitlessly divisible would profoundly impact the development of the \nsubtle and powerful physical theories of both Anaxagoras, who accepts\nthe principle, and the early atomists, Leucippus and Democritus, who \nreject it. Zeno\u2019s arguments also had a formative influence on \nAristotle\u2019s own theory of the continuum and of continuous motion. \nMore generally, Zeno\u2019s arguments made it necessary for Greek natural \nphilosophers to develop something more than an everyday conception of\nthe composition of material bodies. His arguments, perhaps more than \nanything else, forced the Greek natural philosophers to develop \nproperly physical theories of composition as opposed to the \nessentially chemical theories of earlier thinkers such as Empedocles.\nThat mathematicians and physicists have worked ever since to develop \nresponses to the more ingenious of his paradoxes is remarkable, \nthough perhaps not surprising, for immunity to his paradoxes might be\ntaken as a condition upon the adequacy of our most basic physical \nconcepts. He may even have offered his collection of paradoxes to \nprovoke deeper consideration of the adequacy of theretofore \nunexamined notions. If so, it is likewise remarkable that he \nsimultaneously developed forms of argument\u2014most notably, \nreductio ad absurdum by means of antinomical and/or regress \narguments\u2014that have ever since been fundamental to \nphilosophical probing of conceptual adequacy. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Further Reading", "Primary Sources", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Further Reading": ["</h3>\n<p>\n\nReferences in this bibliography to items prior to 1980 are more\nselective than those to more recent items.
