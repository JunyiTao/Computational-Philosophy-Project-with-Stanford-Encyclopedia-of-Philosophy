    "main_text": "\n\nAsserting is the act of claiming that something is the case\u2014for\ninstance, that oranges are citruses, or that there is a\ntraffic congestion on Brooklyn Bridge (at some time). We make\nassertions to share information, coordinate our actions, defend\narguments, and communicate our beliefs and desires. Because of its\ncentral role in communication, assertion has been investigated in\nseveral disciplines. Linguists, philosophers of language, and\nlogicians rely heavily on the notion of assertion in theorizing about\nmeaning, truth and inference.\n\nThe nature of assertion and its relation to other speech acts and\nlinguistic phenomena (implicatures, presuppositions, etc.) have been\nsubject to much controversy. This entry will situate assertion within\nspeech act theory and pragmatics more generally, and then go on to\npresent the current main accounts of\n assertion.[1]\n\nBy an account of assertion is here meant a theory of what\na speaker does (e.g., expresses a belief) in making an\nassertion. According to such accounts, there are deep properties of\nassertion: specifying those properties is specifying what asserting\nconsists in. There must also be surface properties, which are\nthe properties by which a competent speaker can tell whether an\nutterance is an assertion, for instance that it is made by means of\nuttering a sentence in the indicative mood.\n\nWe shall classify accounts according two parameters. Firstly, we\ndistinguish between normative and descriptive\naccounts. Normative accounts rely on the existence of norms or\nnormative relations that are essential to assertoric practice.\nDescriptive accounts don\u2019t. Secondly, we distinguish between\ncontent-directed and hearer-directed accounts.\nContent-directed accounts focus on the relation between the speaker\nand the content of the proposition asserted, while hearer-directed\naccounts focus on the relations between speaker and hearer. Some\ntheories have both normative and descriptive components. The entry is\nstructured as follows\n",
