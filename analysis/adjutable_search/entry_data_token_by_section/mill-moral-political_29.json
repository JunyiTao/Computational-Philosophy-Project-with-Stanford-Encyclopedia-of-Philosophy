    "main_text": "Sexual Equality || Is the Sexual Division of Labor Natural?\n5.3 Is the Sexual Division of Labor Natural?\n\nIn rebutting potential defenses of sexual inequality by appeal to\nvarious alleged dimensions of natural inferiority, Mill insists that\nwe cannot determine whether traits commonly found in women are the\nproduct of nature or nurture without suitable social experimentation,\nincluding, the social experiment of sexual equality. In particular,\nthere is the very real possibility that the traits alleged to justify\nsexual discrimination are the product of past discriminatory practice.\nBut Mill does not adhere to this point consistently (see Annas 1977;\nOkin 1979: 226\u201330). At several points, he expresses the\nconviction that most women with a full menu of opportunities will\naccept a traditional sexual division of labor in which they perform\ndomestic functions while their husbands pursue professions in civil\nsociety, and he approves of this traditional division of labor.\n\n\nWhen the support of the family depends, not on property, but on\nearning, the common arrangement, by which the man earns the income and\nthe wife superintends the domestic expenditure, seems to me in general\nthe most suitable division of labor between the two persons. \u2026\nIn an otherwise just state of things, it is not, therefore, I think, a\ndesirable custom, that the wife should contribute by her labour to the\nincome of the family. (SW 297)\n\n\nOf course, Mill is right that a wife should not also have to\nearn a living outside the home if she is working full time within the\nhome. But he gives no reason for thinking that women should have\nfamilies or that, if they do, they, rather than their husbands, should\nbe responsible for matters domestic. Indeed, Mill\u2019s view seems\nto be that for women extra-domestic vocations should be reserved\nprimarily for those without children or whose children are already\ngrown (338). He seems here to assume that the traditional sexual\ndivision of labor is natural. Of course, it is possible that the\ntraditional sexual division of labor would emerge in a system of equal\nopportunity. But this is conjecture. Indeed, one might have thought\nthat his own claims about how the system of unequal opportunity has\nrepressed women\u2019s creative and managerial capacities would have\nsuggested that the traditional sexual division of labor was probably\nnot robust. In defending or at least speculating about the robustness\nof the traditional sexual division of labor, Mill appears to be\nignoring his own methodological strictures.\n",
