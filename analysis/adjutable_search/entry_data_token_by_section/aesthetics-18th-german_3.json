    "main_text": "Gottsched and His Critics: Truth and Imagination\n2. Gottsched and His Critics: Truth and Imagination\n\n\nIn Wolff\u2019s description of the experience of beauty as the\n\u201csensitive cognition of perfection,\u201d cognition is\nnaturally understood as knowledge of truth, so in the first instance\nWolff\u2019s formula meant that the experience of beauty is knowledge of\ntruth by means of the senses. Yet Wolff\u2019s conception of perfection was\nbroad enough to include successful adaptation to an intended purpose,\nand thus in his analysis of our experience of architecture he\nemphasized our sense of the utility of structures as well as a sensory\nresponse to the kind of abstract form that could be considered an\nobject of cognition.  But it was the idea that aesthetic experience is\na sensory apprehension of truth that dominated in Wolff\u2019s most general\nstatements.  After 1720, Wolff\u2019s philosophy enjoyed an influence in\nmost parts of Germany similar to that which the philosophy of Locke\nexercised in most quarters in Britain by then and in France beginning\na decade or two later. So the history of German aesthetics after Wolff\nis a history of the attempt to find room for a fuller account of\naesthetic experience within a framework that privileges the idea of\ncognition, and only gradually was room found for the idea that the\nfree play of our mental powers, including not only imagination but at\nleast for some authors also emotion, could be equally important. The\nfirst round of this struggle was a debate extending from the late\n1720s until the 1740s between the Leipzig literary figure Johann\nChristoph Gottsched and the Z\u00fcrich critics Johann Jacob Bodmer and\nJohann Jacob Breitinger, in which the issue was really just how much\nroom there could be for the freedom of imagination within a theory of\npoetry based on the idea that poetry is a truthful imitation of\nnature. This might be understood as an early form of debate over how\nmuch room there is for the free play of imagination in aesthetic\nexperience.\n\n\nFrom a distance of almost three hundred years, the differences between\nthe \u201ccritical poetics\u201d (critische Dichtkunst) of\nJohann Christoph Gottsched and his critics may seem small, because to\nus they are all so clearly working within the paradigm established by\nWolff. Yet in the 1730s and 1740s their debate was intense, not just\nbecause Gottsched was a self-important controversialist who clearly\nenjoyed being on center stage, but also because their debate about the\nproper scope and power of the imagination was both theoretically\ninteresting and reflected a tectonic shift in German taste. This shift\nis away from the French classicism represented by Racine and Corneille\nto the freer forms of Milton and Shakespeare, which in turn lead to\nthe pan-European romanticism of the later eighteenth and early\nnineteenth centuries.\n",
