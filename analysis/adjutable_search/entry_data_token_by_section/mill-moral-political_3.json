    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Utilitarianism || Psychological Egoism\n2.1 Psychological Egoism\n\nHenry Sidgwick (1838\u20131900), for one, read Mill as a\npsychological egoist (The Methods of Ethics 42\u201344).\nThis is not just guilt by association. For it may appear that Mill\nendorses psychological egoism in his so-called \u201cproof\u201d of\nthe principle of utility in Chapter IV of Utilitarianism.\nThere, Mill aims to show that happiness is the one and only thing\ndesirable in itself (U IV 2). To do this, he argues that\nhappiness is desirable in itself (IV 3), and a central premise in this\nargument is that everyone desires his own happiness (IV 3). Mill later\nargues that only happiness is desirable (IV 4).\n\nBut the proof does not reveal Mill to be a psychological egoist. While\nMill does say that each person has an ultimate desire for her own\nhappiness, he does not say that this is each person\u2019s only\nultimate desire. Indeed, in the second half of the proof he allows\nthat some agents have a disinterested concern for virtue and that they\ncare about virtue for its own sake (IV 4\u20135). And what is true of\nvirtue is no less true of less grand objects of desire, such as money\nor power (IV 6). These too it is possible to desire for their own\nsakes. If psychological egoism claims that one\u2019s own happiness\nis the only thing that is desired for its own sake, then this shows\nthat Mill is not a psychological egoist.\n\nIf we look outside of Utilitarianism we can find even clearer\nevidence of Mill\u2019s doubts about psychological egoism and\nhedonism. In a note to his edition of James Mill\u2019s Analysis\nof the Phenomena of the Human Mind (1869) John Stuart Mill\ndiagnoses a possible equivocation in his father\u2019s doctrine.\n\n\nThat the pleasures or pains of another person can only be pleasurable\nor painful to us through the association of our own pleasures and\npains with them, is true in one sense, which is probably that intended\nby the author, but not true in another, against which he has not\nsufficiently guarded his mode of expression. It is evident, that the\nonly pleasures or pains of which we have direct experience \u2026\n[are] those felt by ourselves \u2026 [and] that the pleasure or pain\nwith which we contemplate the pleasure or pain felt by someone else,\nis itself a pleasure or pain of our own. But if it be meant that in\nsuch cases the pleasure or pain is consciously referred to self, I\ntake this to be a mistake. (Notes II 217\u201318)\n\n\nIn his \u201cRemarks on Bentham\u2019s Philosophy\u201d (1833) Mill\nurges a similar caution in understanding Bentham.\n\n\nIn laying down as a philosophical axiom that men\u2019s actions are\nalways obedient to their interests, Mr. Bentham did no more than dress\nup the very trivial proposition that all people do what they feel\nthemselves most disposed to do \u2026. He by no means intended by\nthis assertion to impute universal selfishness to mankind, for he\nreckoned the motive of sympathy as an interest. (CW X:\n13\u201314)\n\n\nIn both passages Mill makes what is now a familiar diagnosis of the\ntroubles with psychological egoism. He thinks that psychological\negoism is ambiguous between a true but trivial thesis about the\nownership of desire\u2014an agent necessarily acts on his\nown desires\u2014and a substantive but wildly implausible thesis\nabout the content of desires\u2014an agent\u2019s ultimate\ndesire is always and necessarily to promote his own interests or\npleasure. If so, there is no thesis that is both substantive and\nplausible. The substantive thesis may seem speciously attractive if we\ntacitly confuse it with the trivially true thesis. But it seems clear\nfrom Bentham\u2019s and James Mill\u2019s worries about the conflict\nbetween ruler\u2019s interests and the interest of the ruled that\nthey intend something like the substantive psychological thesis. But\nif they do so because they conflate it with the trivial but true\nthesis, then they commit the fallacy of equivocation.\n\nSo Mill rejects the substantive doctrines of psychological egoism and\nhedonism that Bentham and his father sometimes defended or suggested.\nThis is really part of a larger criticism of the conception of\npsychology and human nature underlying Benthamite utilitarianism,\nwhich Mill elaborates in his essays on Bentham. Mill\u2019s desire to\ndistance himself from Benthamite assumptions about human nature and\npsychology are also reflected in his conception of happiness and his\ndoctrine of higher pleasures.\n",
