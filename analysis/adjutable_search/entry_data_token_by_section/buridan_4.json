    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n5. Metaphysics\n\n\nBuridan's metaphysics is thoroughly informed by his logic. He tries\nwherever possible to apply the Summulae's analytical\ntechniques to solve problems in speculative philosophy. His approach\nis critical in the sense that he tends to view traditional problems in\nmetaphysics as based on confusions of logic or language. For the same\nreason, his solutions are not original in the modern sense of being\nwithout precedent, although they have few equals in terms of their\nelegance and economy of expression. Where philosophical argumentation\nis concerned, Buridan is a master craftsman.\n\n\nLike most arts masters in fourteenth-century Paris, Buridan is careful\nto dissociate the metaphysical questions he asks as a philosopher from\nsimilar questions that might be asked by a theologian. Jurisdictional\ndisputes forced Parisian arts masters to be quite clear about how they\nwere approaching a\n problem,[34]\n although what we now identify as medieval philosophy was practiced by\nboth sides. As far as Buridan is concerned, much of the confusion over\nthe proper domains of metaphysics and theology stems from Aristotle\nhimself, who identifies three kinds of speculative science: physics,\nmathematics, and\ntheology (Aristotle,\nMetaphysics VI.1.1026a18; XI.7.1064b1).\nIn his question commentary on the Metaphysics, he provides\nthe standard medieval interpretation of this passage, reading\n\u2018theology\u2019 as \u2018metaphysics\u2019 and\ndifferentiating the three sciences in terms of how they treat their\nrespective subjects: whereas the natural philosopher considers things\ninsofar as they are qualified by motion, and the mathematician insofar\nas they are quantified by number, the metaphysician considers them\nonly insofar as they pertain to the \u201cconcept of being [ad\nrationem essendi]\u201d (QM VI.2:\n 34ra).[35]\n For the difference between metaphysics and theology, however, we need\nto go to the very beginning of the commentary, where he offers the\nfollowing gloss of Aristotle's remarks:\nIt should also be noted that [when we ask whether\nmetaphysics is the same as wisdom,] we are not comparing metaphysics to\ntheology, which proceeds from beliefs that are not known, because\nalthough these beliefs are not known per se and most evident,\nwe hold without doubt that theology is the more principal discipline\nand that it is wisdom most properly speaking. In this question,\nhowever, we are merely asking about intellectual habits based on human\nreason, [i.e.,] those discovered by the process of reasoning, which are\ndeduced from what is evident to us. For it is in this sense that\nAristotle calls metaphysics \u2018theology\u2019 and \u2018the\ndivine science\u2019. Accordingly, metaphysics differs from theology\nin the fact that although each considers God and those things that\npertain to divinity, metaphysics only considers them as regards what\ncan be proved and implied, or inductively inferred, by demonstrative\nreason. But theology has for its principles articles [of faith], which\nare believed quite apart from their evidentness, and further, considers\nwhatever can be deduced from articles of this kind. (QM I.2:\n4ra-rb)\n\n\nThe difference is that theologians take their principles\n(\u2018principia\u2019 = (lit.) \u2018starting\npoints\u2019) from articles of faith rather than, like the\nphilosophers, from what is evident to the senses and intellect. So it\nis possible for the same question\u2014e.g., about the limits of divine\nomnipotence\u2014to be raised in both domains, though it will have a\nmore creaturely orientation for the\n philosopher.[36]\n Buridan concedes de jure place of privilege to theology\nbecause of its subject matter, but treats philosophy and theology as\nde facto equivalent in the speculative realm. Metaphysics, or\nphilosophical wisdom, cannot be ordained by theology because its\nmethods, which are rooted in its principles, are different. Philosophy\nis accordingly not inferior to theology, just\n different.[37]\n\n\nWith regard to the problem of\n universals,[38]\n Buridan does not so much create a new theory as show how our\ntheoretical commitments can be expressed with a minimum of ambiguity\nand fuss. Like Ockham, he is a nominalist, although this term must be\nused with caution in later medieval philosophy because of the modern\ntendency to identify it with the denial of real universals. It must be\nremembered that most fourteenth-century philosophers were nominalists\nin this sense because they associated the contrary doctrine with\nPlato, with whom they were familiar only secondarily as one of the\nauthors whose views are thoroughly discredited by Aristotle in Book I\nof the\n Metaphysics.[39]\n But medieval nominalism involved much more than rejecting Platonic\nuniversals. Its history can be traced to twelfth-century disputes over\nthe reading of sacred texts, in which the techniques of logicians such\nas Abelard were pitted against those of grammarians such as Peter\n Helias.[40]\n As these disputes evolved and matured, nominalism was gradually\nabsorbed into the teaching of philosophers working in the faculty of\narts, so that by Buridan's time, it is better to think of nominalism\nas a practice, or way of doing philosophy, rather than as a piece of\ndoctrine.\n\n\nWhen Buridan considers questions such as \u201cwhether universals\nactually exist outside the soul\u201d (TDUI: 137), his remarks are\nalmost always aimed at clarifying the meaning of the term\n\u2018universal\u2019 with respect to other terms such as\n\u2018individual\u2019, \u2018particular\u2019, and\n\u2018singular\u2019. His rejection of realism is expressed in the\nclaim that universal terms have no ultimate significate, i.e., nothing\noutside the soul they can \u2018make known\u2019 as\n such.[41]\n Hence, an account is needed of what such terms mean. Here, it is\nalmost as if Buridan thinks there is something ill-formed about\npropositions where the term \u2018universal\u2019 occurs in the\nsubject position, for when confronted with them his first move is\nalways to tell us how the term \u2018universal\u2019 is to be\nunderstood (QIP 3: 136, ll.\n 477\u2013488).[42]\n He argues further that the primary\nsignification of \u2018universal\u2019 is \u2018predicable of\nmany\u2019, which makes it a term of second intention, or a term of\nterms, since only terms are predicable (QIP 3: 135\u2013136; 4: 139; TDUI:\n 148).[43]\n The second-intentional status of the term \u2018universal\u2019 is\nalso evident in propositions, where it does not signify a\n\u2018what\u2019 but a \u2018how\u2019, i.e., how we conceive of\nsomething\u2014in this case how the term so designated is\n\u201cindifferent to many supposits,\u201d or individuals\n (TDUI: 59; see Zupko 2013b).[44]\n As we saw above, logic is the study of terms such as\n\u2018proposition\u2019 taken materially, signifying actual tokens\nof the type (QDI I.1: 6). Moving from propositions to arguments,\nBuridan insists that terms in the premises and conclusions of\ndemonstrative arguments must be taken as standing materially, i.e.,\nfor themselves in the particular discourse conditions which surround\nthem, rather than personally, for their extra-mental significates (QIP\n1: 128, ll. 223\u2013237). Likewise, the proximate object of scientific\nknowledge is the actual demonstrated or demonstrable conclusion rather\nthan the state of affairs it signifies, although Buridan is willing to\nconcede that \u201cthe terms of those demonstrable conclusions, or\neven the things signified by those conclusions\u201d might be\nconsidered \u201cremote\u201d, or secondary, objects of knowledge\n(QIP 1: 127, l.\n 208\u2013209).[45]\n Careful and systematic analysis is the best antidote for metaphysical\nperplexity because the trouble usually begins with untutored persons\nwho use some word or concept without knowing what it means.\n\nOn the question of universals, Buridan's main contribution is to\ndevelop what Gyula Klima has nicely termed an \u201cessentialist\nnominalism\u201d, arguing for the reality of the natures underlying our\nsimple substance concepts. Ockham understood universality in terms of\nthe inherent indifference of our cognitive acts, so that despite our\nhaving had different particular experiences of horses, say, we are\nable to form complex concepts that count as universal provided they\nare able to represent all horses; crucially, there is nothing of the\nsubstantial nature of a horse that is conveyed via the senses to the\nintellect on Ockham's theory. Against this, Buridan argues that\nsubstantial concepts cannot merely be collections of complex,\nconnotative concepts, because then we would have the absurd conclusion\nthat substantial terms are not substantial terms, for the concepts\naccording to which they were imposed to signify would not be simple\nsubstance concepts:\nAgain, if the substantial concept of man were complex,\nthen let us posit that it consists of three simple ones,\nnamely, a, b, and c.  Then, if no concept of\nsubstance is simple, a can only be a concept of accident, and\nthe same goes for b and c; therefore, the whole combined\nfrom them would also be only a concept of accident, and not one of\nsubstance, for a whole is nothing over and above its parts.  But this\nis absurd, namely, that the substantial concept of man should be\nnothing but a concept of accidents; therefore, etc. [QP I.4,\ned. Streijger & Bakker: 36, ll. 3\u20139; tr. Klima 2009:\n95]\n\nBuridan proceeds to identify four ways in which one can obtain one\nsimple cognition from another directly, or without any inference [QP\nI.4, ed. Streijger & Bakker: \n36\u201337].[46] \nThe details need not detain us here, but\nsuffice it to say that the \u201cempiricist\u201d side of Buridan's nominalism\nis always leavened by Aristotelian naturalism, which he felt was\nneeded to combat skeptical arguments about scientific knowledge, and\nindeed, about the very existence of substances\u2014arguments Ockham\nnever had to confront.\n\n\nIt also should be noted that Buridan's methods do not always produce\nparsimonious results. Like Ockham, he has only substances and qualities\nin his basic ontology, but he is much more willing than Ockham to\nexpand this in the direction of modes or ways of being when confronted\nwith recalcitrant phenomena. Thus, he argues that we must treat the\nquestion of how something is as distinct from what it\nis if we are to have a coherent understanding of motion, especially\nsince the Ockhamist view is forced to posit an infinite succession of\nspatial qualities (QM V.9: 32va; QP II.3, ed. Streijger & \nBakker, 256\u2013263; QP IV.11, ed. Streijger & Bakker,\n 299\u2013305).[47]\n Likewise, in a famous passage, Buridan is driven by his own\nexperience to reject Ockham's explanation of condensation and\nrarefaction as kinds of locomotion. Why, he asks, does he find himself\nunable to compress further the air in a bellows which has been stopped\nup at one end? Not because of its matter, since more matter could\nexist in a much smaller space; nor because of the substantial form of\nthe air, which would fill a much smaller space once it has been\ncooled; nor even because of the heat it possesses, since more heat\ncould exist in a much smaller space, such as at the end of a red-hot\npoker. No, the air must have a distinct quantitative form or magnitude\npreventing it from being moved. Against those who would do away with\nthis distinction, Buridan argues that \u201ca distinct magnitude of this sort\nhas not been posited in vain, for we have been forced to posit it\nby compelling arguments that make it seem as useful or even more useful to\nnatural philosophy than [the qualities of] whiteness or\nblackness\u201d (QP I.8, ed. Streijger & Bakker, 92, ll. \n3\u20136).[48]\n",
