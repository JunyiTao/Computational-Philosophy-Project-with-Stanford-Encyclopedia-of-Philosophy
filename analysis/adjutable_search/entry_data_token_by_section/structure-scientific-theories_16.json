Because of the Pragmatic View\u2019s attention to\npractice, function, and application, distinguishing structure\nfrom interpretation is more difficult here than under the\nSyntactic and Semantic Views. Any synchronic analysis of the structure\nof models and theories must respect intentional diachronic processes\nof interpreting and using, as we shall now see.\n\nRegarding the import of function in models and theories (thesis #4),\nalready the Belgian philosopher of science Apostel defined modeling\nthus: \u201cLet then \\(R(S,P,M,T)\\) indicate the main variables of\nthe modelling relationship. The subject \\(S\\) takes, in view of the\npurpose \\(P\\), the entity \\(M\\) as a model for the prototype\n\\(T\\)\u201d (1960, 128, see also Apostel 1970). Purposes took\ncenter-stage in his article title: \u201cTowards the Formal Study of\nModels in the Non-Formal Sciences.\u201d MIT Artificial Intelligence\ntrailblazer Minsky also provided a pragmatic analysis:\n\nWe use the term \u201cmodel\u201d in the following sense: To an\nobserver \\(B\\), an object \\(A^*\\) is a model of an object \\(A\\) to the\nextent that \\(B\\) can use \\(A^*\\) to answer questions that interest\nhim about \\(A\\). The model relation is inherently ternary. Any\nattempt to suppress the role of the intentions of the investigator\n\\(B\\) leads to circular definitions or to ambiguities about\n\u201cessential features\u201d and the like. (1965, 45)\n\n\nThis account is thoroughly intentionalist and anti-essentialist. That\nis, mapping relations between model and world are left open and\noverdetermined. Specifying the relevant relations depends on\ncontextual factors such as questions asked, and the kinds of\nsimilarities and isomorphisms deemed to be of interest. The\nappropriate relations are selected from an infinite (or, at least,\nnear-infinite) variety of possible relations (e.g., Rosenblueth and\nWiener 1945; Lowry 1965).\n\nRegarding practice (thesis #5), in addition to ample work on the\nexperimental life mentioned above, consider a small example. A full\nunderstanding of the content and structure of the London\nbrothers\u2019 model of superconductivity requires attention to\ninformal aspects such as analogies. Even London and London (1935)\nstate in the summary of their paper that \u201cthe current [\u201din\na supraconductor\u201c] is characterized as a kind of diamagnetic\nvolume current\u201d (88). They too saw the diamagnetic analogy as\ncentral to their theoretical practices. Criteria and practices of\ntheory confirmation also differ from the ones typical of the Syntactic\nand Semantic Views. While predictive and explanatory power as well as\nempirical adequacy remain important, the Pragmatic View also insists\non a variety of other justificatory criteria, including pragmatic\nvirtues (sensu Kuhn 1977; Longino 1995) such as fruitfulness and\nutility. In a nutshell, the Pragmatic View argues that scientific\ntheory structure is deeply shaped and constrained by functions and\npractices, and that theory can be interpreted and applied validly\naccording to many different criteria.\n",
