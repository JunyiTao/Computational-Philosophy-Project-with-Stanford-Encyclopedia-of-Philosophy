    "main_text": "\n\nCollective intentionality is the power of minds to be jointly directed\nat objects, matters of fact, states of affairs, goals, or values.\nCollective intentionality comes in a variety of modes, including\nshared intention, joint attention, shared belief, collective\nacceptance, and collective emotion. Collective intentional attitudes\npermeate our everyday lives, for instance when two or more agents look\nafter or raise a child, grieve the loss of a loved one, campaign for a\npolitical party, or cheer for a sports team. They are relevant for\nphilosophers and social scientists because they play crucial roles in\nthe constitution of the social world. In joint attention, the\nworld is experienced as perceptually available for a plurality of\nagents. This establishes a basic sense of common ground on which other\nagents may be encountered as potential cooperators. Shared\nintention enables the participants to act together intentionally,\nin a coordinated and cooperative fashion, and to achieve collective\ngoals. The capacity for shared belief provides us with a common stock\nof knowledge, and thus with a background against which relevant new\ninformation which we may want to share with others becomes salient.\nCollective acceptance is crucial for the development of\nlanguage, and for a whole world of symbols, institutions, and social\nstatus. Collective emotions provide us with a shared\nconception of what matters to us, together, and they establish\nreadiness for joint action. In virtue of capacity for collective\nintentionality, we can (and should) engage in joint reasoning and\ndeliberation, and (re-)organize ourselves to make sure that the way we\nlive together is how we, collectively, want it to be, from our\nsmall-scale communities to global politics.\n\nCollective intentional attitudes involve a plurality of participants\nin such a way that the attitudes in question can be ascribed to\nindividuals as a group, or unit. The main philosophical\nchallenge connected with the analysis of collective intentionality is\nin the tension within the expression \u201cindividuals as a\ngroup\u201d. It can be spelled out as a contradiction between the\nfollowing two widely accepted claims (the Central Problem): \n\nCollective intentionality is no simple summation, aggregate, or\ndistributive pattern of individual intentionality (the Irreducibility\nClaim);\n Collective intentionality is had by the participating\nindividuals, and all the intentionality an individual has is their own\n(the Individual Ownership Claim). \n\n\nOver the last couple of decades, a number of theories of collective\nintentionality have been proposed, pointing towards different ways to\nsolve this tension.\n",
