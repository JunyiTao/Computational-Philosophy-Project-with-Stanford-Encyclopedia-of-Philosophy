    "main_text": "Extensions and Elaborations || Macroevolution\n6.5 Macroevolution\n\nMany evolutionists have argued that biological tools can have great\nvalue when developing a historical view of the pattern of cultural\nchange (see, for example, Gray, Greenhill, & Ross 2007; Mace &\nHolden 2005; Lewens 2012, and the entry on\n macroevolution).\n Consider phylogenetics. A variety of biological methods have been\ndeveloped that help us to uncover the structure of evolutionary trees:\nthey show which taxa split from which others and when. It seems clear\nthat cultural items of many kinds (most obviously languages, but also\ntools and techniques) also stand in recognizable genealogical\nrelationships, and this has led many biological anthropologists to use\nphylogenetic methods borrowed or adapted from the biological sciences\nto reconstruct history in the cultural realm.\n\nCritics have sometimes followed Gould (1988) in arguing that these\nbiological methods cannot be properly applied to culture, because\ncultural genealogies invariably take the form of reticulated networks\nrather than branching trees. Cultural change is indeed often highly\nreticulated: it is obvious that a complex object like a car is a\nconfluence of numerous technical lineages, which come together to form\nthe hi-fi system, the engine, the safety devices, and so forth.\nMoreover, as improvements are made to cars these new developments may\nbe borrowed by innovators of bicycles, furniture, toys, and other\nshifting constellations of artifacts.\n\nThese important observations need not undermine the project of\ncultural phylogeny. One response is to look to those aspects of\nculture most amenable to phylogenetic reconstruction, such as deeply\nconserved linguistic terms (Cabrera 2017)\u2014a strategy adopted by\nmany early adopters of phylogenetic methods. Another is to recognize\nthat biological evolution is also reticulated. Bacteria, for example,\ndo not form genealogically isolated lineages, hybridization is rife\namong plants, and there is also considerable borrowing of elements of\nthe genome between apparently isolated mammalian species. Of course,\nthis might show simply that phylogenetic modes of inference are doubly\nimperiled: they don\u2019t work for much of the biological world\neither. But cultural evolutionists (e.g., Gray, Greenhill, & Ross\n2007) are encouraged by inferential developments within biology\nitself, which aim to reconstruct partially reticulated trees by\nproposing so-called \u201creconciliations\u201d of the conflicting\ntrees that traditional methods often propose for species and genes.\nThese have shown promise beyond the original home of cultural\nphylogenetics in reconstructing trees based on language families,\nextending to archaeology and technology (Jordan 2015; Gjesfjeld &\nJordan 2019).\n\nThis kind of work is important, in part because of the uses to which\nwell-confirmed cultural phylogenies can be put. It may be easiest to\nillustrate their value via a simple example. On the face of things,\nlooking for correlations is a reasonable (albeit fallible) way to\ndiscover causal relationships. If, for example, people who smoke often\nget lung cancer, and people with lung cancer are often smokers, then\nwe have good evidence that smoking causes lung cancer (or perhaps that\nlung cancer causes smoking). But there can be strong correlations that\ndo not indicate causation. If, for example, we find that there is a\nstrong correlation in animals between making a moo sound and producing\nlarge quantities of milk, we should not conclude that one causes the\nother. Mooing and milk production go together because the creatures in\nquestion share ancestors in common, who both mooed and gave lots of\nmilk. Of course, in the case of cows this fact of common ancestry is\nso obvious that we hardly notice how it informs our causal inference.\nBut cultural phylogenies are unobvious. Russell Gray, among others,\nhas long argued that when we understand them better, our knowledge of\nphylogenies can then confirm, or undermine, causal hypotheses that are\nclaimed on the basis of correlation.\n\nGray and Watts (2017), for example, have scrutinized what is sometimes\ncalled the Supernatural Punishment Hypothesis. This is the hypothesis\nthat belief in powerful gods, who inflict punishment on wrongdoers,\ntends to result in societies better able to harness the fruits of\ncooperation (see Norenzayan et al. 2016). Gray and Watts again caution\nthat mere correlation between societies that believe in\n\u201cmoralising high gods\u201d and various measures of social\ncomplexity does not count strongly in favor of the Supernatural\nPunishment Hypothesis. One must also consider the potentially\nconfounding consequences of shared ancestry among the societies\nsurveyed. Gray and Watts draw on Austronesian data to argue that\nbelief in moralizing high gods tends to be gained after, not before,\nthe emergence of political complexity. These data, they suggest,\nundermine the thought that moralizing high gods drive this form of\ncomplexity. That said, they do find some support for a weaker\nsupernatural punishment hypothesis based on belief in punishment\ninterventions from natural spirits, ancestral spirits and mythical\nheroes, as well as from moralizing high gods. In their view this type\nof belief facilitated, \u201cthe rise of political complexity\u201d\nwithout \u201chelping sustain it\u201d (Gray & Watts 2017:\n7848). Work such as this indicates the potential for cultural\nphylogenetics to inform broad-sweep hypotheses about not just the\npatterns, but also the causal processes, that have marked the cultural\nhistory of our species.\n\nOf course, phylogenetic methods are far from the only means of\nreconstructing cultural history. More recently, archaeologists have\nargued for new methods and theories based on analogies between\narchaeology and paleobiology. Just as paleobiologists identify\nevolutionary trends and patterns by looking at the fossil\nrecord\u2014notably, periodic mass extinctions and rates of\nspeciation\u2014suitably rich archaeological databases might allow\nresearchers to discern distinctive patterns, processes, and trends in\nthe cultural evolutionary record (Perreault 2019; Gjesfjeld et al.\n2016). Perreault (2012), for instance, compares evolutionary and\narchaeological datasets to quantify the oft-informally made claim that\nculture evolution proceeds more quickly than biological evolution. A\ndifferent set of arguments considers how archaeological databases and\nstatistical techniques may help revise archaeological systematics and\ncultural taxonomy (Riede et al. 2020; Lyman 2021). The two efforts are\nrelated. Classificatory work may feedback into so-called\n\u201cmacro-archaeological\u201d work that includes discerning rates\nof cultural diversification and extinction (Perreault 2019).\n",
