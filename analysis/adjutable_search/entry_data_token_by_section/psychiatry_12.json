    "main_text": "Alternatives to the Medical Model || 4E Philosophy of Psychiatry\n4.2 4E Philosophy of Psychiatry\n\nAn important development that is avowedly sceptical of the existing\nbiomedical paradigm in psychiatry is the rise of approaches inspired by\nthe 4E movement in philosophy of mind \u2013 the \u201cembedded,\nembodied, extended and enactive\u201d tradition. Many philosophers of\npsychology and cognitive scienctists dispute the viability of\nwhat they see as an unduly reductive and anti-environmental tradition\nof philosophical psychology. To this internalist tradition is\nattributed the view that the mind is confined to the \u2018skin and\nskull\u2019 of individual agents and that psychological processes and\ntheir pathologies are entirely explained by the brain and central\nnervous system. On this view, whatever is responsible for cognition is\nwholly within the agent, and thus can be studied while\n\u2018bracketing off\u2019 an agent\u2019s social and material\nenvironment. Externalists have argued that this tradition has both\ndriven and been reinforced by approaches to psychiatry that are too\nbrain-centred (Sneddon 2002, Roberts et al 2019) and lobby for greater\nattention to environmental or other extra-cranial factors.\n(Internalists, or proponents of traditional views of\u00a0 cognition,\none should add, often disagree with this view of what they are\ncommitted to or find the commitments of 4E too vague to be helpful\n(Aizawa 2018, Rupert 2016)). \u00a0As well as externalists, the 4E\nmovement includes \u2018embedded\u2019 theorists who stress the\ndependency of minds on environmental scaffolding (Hutchins 1995) and\n\u201cembodied\u201d theorists who believe that bodies or aspects of\nthe wider environment are constitutive of mental states, and often that\nsensorimotor phenomena are constitutive parts of cognition, rather than\njust the input and output of cognition (or what Hurley (1998) calls the\n\u2018sandwich model\u2019). Enactivism tends to be the more radical\nview that mental life can be explained via the dynamic interaction of\nnervous system, body and environment without reference to mental\nrepresentation (Hutto and Myin 2013).\n\nClark and Chalmers (1997) motivated the extended mind thesis using a\nthought experiment centring upon memory. Its protagonists, Otto and\nInga, each need to remember how to get to MOMA for an exhibition. Inga\nhas been to MOMA many times and gets there via introspective recall. But\nOtto has an impaired\ncapacity to produce, store and retrieve memories. To cope with this, he\ncarries a notebook containing important information. Otto routinely\nconsults and updates his notebook, he always carries it with him, and\nhe endorses its contents. A variant of this view holds that agents are\ntypically embedded in wider set of environmental and social phenomena,\nand that these exogenous factors are explanatorily vital and often\nneglected when it comes to cognition, but that cognition is\nintra-cranial.\n\nThe consensus among 4E proponents is that psychiatry is wedded to a\nnumber of outdated philosophical positions, although there is not\nalways agreement about what these positions are. Zoe Drayson\n(2009), for example, thinks that psychiatry is committed to old\nfashioned models of artificial intelligence that ignore embodiment,\nwhereas other theorists (Davies 2016) think that psychiatry is too\nneglectful of the environment, or has the wrong picture of explanation\nand causation (de Haan 2019). Indeed, it is unclear whether any\nparticular scientific research program derives from core 4E\ncommitments. One might see the movement as what Godfrey-Smith (2001)\ncalls a philosophy of nature or (in this case) a piece of philosophical\nanthropology (cf Gallagher 2017). As Godfrey-Smith puts it (2001,\np.284\u20135) a philosophy of nature comes after science, and aims to\ndescribe and interpret the world as disclosed by science. One can see\n4E as giving us a view of human nature that stresses the\ninterdependence of person and environment and emphasizes the dynamic\naspects of cognition, which is seen as a special kind of animacy.\nBecause of this variety within the movement it is not easy to construct\na core program for philosophical psychiatry that every scholar with\nsome 4E attachments would accept, but there are recurrent themes that\ncan be assessed here.\n\nTo begin with, many externalist approaches to psychiatry contest\nwhat they see as the basic ontological commitments of psychiatry when\nit comes to mental illness, by objecting to what is seen as a reductive\nor internalist thesis that psychiatric conditions are neurological\ndisorders. Competing conceptions of mental illness may accept that\npsychiatric conditions involve neural dysfunction in some sense, but\nthey argue that no psychic process, including pathological ones,\n\u201ccan be reduced to the brain or to localized neural activities:\nthey are embodied, inherently intentional, and context related\u201d\n(Fuchs 2018, p. 253)\n\nThis claim can be made in ways that are more or less committed to 4E\nmachinery. It is possible, for example, to argue, as Levy (2007) does\nfor addiction, that a condition cannot be seen as a brain disorder\nbecause its symptoms only arise in specific social environments. Davies\n(2016) asserts that many psychiatric categories are committed to\n\u2018constitutive externalism\u2019, by which he means that one\ncannot be diagnosed with those conditions unless one stands in certain\nrelations to features of the environment, including the social\nenvironment. This position could be adopted even if one has only very\nweak commitments in the 4E vein; it is based on claims about the\nrelations between subjects and environments rather than theories about\nthe nature of the mind. Furthermore, although Davies asserts that these\nfeatures distinguish psychiatry from somatic medicine, they plainly do\nnot. As Glackin notes (2017) each of Davies\u2019 examples has\nparallels in somatic medicine. In a similar vein, Fuchs (2018) argues\nthat the tendency of contemporary psychiatry is to isolate the patient\nfrom their surroundings and study disorder independently of the\nenvironment.\n\nIt is not easy to evaluate claims like these, given that psychiatry\ndoes pay attention to social and biographical contingencies in a\npatient\u2019s life. It may be that the force of the objection is that\nthese extra-cranial factors are acknowledged but not taken seriously in\ntreatment, which tends to be too much directed at aspects of the\ncondition inside the patient that can be addressed by drugs. In defence\nof psychiatry, one might point out that changing a patient\u2019s\nbrain is often a lot easier than changing society or even the\npatient\u2019s local environment or life circumstances. However, it\ndoes seem clear that prescinding from the details of the situation and\nassessing a patient in a context insensitive way does happen, and it\ncan be a source of problems.\n\nThe purpose of the Otto/Inga example is to challenge the assumption\nthat only processes that take place \u201cin the head\u201d are\npsychological. When Otto consults his diary, he has the occurrent\nbelief that MOMA is located on Fifty-third street. What the authors\nclaim, in addition to this, is that, like Inga, who remembers it\nunaided, Otto also has the dispositional belief that MOMA is located on\nFifty-third street before he consults his notebook. Otto\u2019s\ncapacity for storage and retrieval of memories extends beyond the\nbrain, and encompasses the notebook as a resource, in the same way that\nInga\u2019s storage and retrieval depends on neural resources. Drayson\nand Clark (2019) discuss cases in which sufferers of Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease perform poorly in standard tests but live alone successfully.\nTheir homes are carefully scaffolded by personalised mnemonic props,\nincluding post-it notes, labelled pictures, strategically placed items,\nand messaging centres. If we are interested in an accurate assessment\nof an agent\u2019s mental health we will be led astray if we do not\nfind room in standard capacity tests for the role that an agent\u2019s\nenvironment might play in their cognitive functioning. Further, the\nrole of the environment must also be considered in therapeutic\ncontexts: decisions to relocate subjects from their homes to\nresidential care facilities, for example, are typically accompanied by\ndecline in cognitive health.\n\nAccording to an internalist or scaffolded/situated approach,\nexternal artefacts (such as notebooks) or other agents (such as life\npartners) can only be props that compensate for an incapacity. On this\nview, Otto suffers from a deficit Inga does not have, and is thus less\nhealthy than she is. However, if we think, as externalists do, that\nOtto\u2019s notebook is a part of his cognitive architecture, we\nshould attribute him the same capacity to remember as Inga, for the\nonly difference between Otto and Inga, in this respect, is that\nOtto\u2019s psychological capacity is realised by an agent-environment\nsystem of which he is part.\n\n\nHoffman (2016) argues that the extended mind thesis thus has\nimplications for how we judge the mental health status of an agent,\nincluding whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria for particular\ndisorders. Based on this discussion, we can draw a distinction between\nnarrow, situated and wide theories of mental disorder (Murphy, Donovan\nand Smart forthcoming). The narrow construal is strongly internalist:\nthe only genuine psychological capacities are those realized by\ncognitive architecture internal to the agent. The situated view\nconstrues psychological capacities as intimately dependent upon\nenvironmental states of affairs, and so prohibits methodological\nsolipsism. A full understanding of the capacities exercised require an\nunderstanding of agent-world dynamics.\n\nA wide account tells a different story. Otto\u2019s mental health is not\ncompromised, whatever the state of\u00a0 his brain, because using his\nnotebook he can store and retrieve memories in a functionally\nequivalent manner to Inga. Poor mental health can be the outcome of\nneural dysfunction, but it can also owe to problems with the\nenvironments in which agents are situated, as well as with their\ncapacity to fruitfully exploit environmental resources (Sneddon 2002;\nRoberts, Krueger, and Glackin 2019). The externalist claims that she\ncan discern types of explanations, interventions and strategies that an\ninternalist picture misses.\n4.3 Network models\n\nThe medical model is widely believed to borrow the \u201ccommon\ncause\u201d structure of general medicine, in which observed variables\n(symptoms) indicate the existence of a latent variable that is their\ncause. The network model (Nuijten et al 2016), however, makes a very\ndifferent bet. Rather than an underlying cause or latent variable, it\nattributes the joint occurrence and course of the clustered symptoms to\nthe fact that they are part of the same network: \u201cinstead of\nbeing effects of a common cause, psychiatric symptoms have been argued\nto cause each other\u201d (Borsboom 2017, p.5). This can be\nrepresented as a network\u00a0 in which symptoms are nodes, and the\nconnections between nodes indicate causal relations, which we can\nunderstand using interventionist models of causation.\n\nEach symptom is a node, and a change in a node changes the\nprobability distribution of the other symptoms which are connected to\nthe original node. For example, difficulties in sleeping is likely to\nbe strongly connected to fatigue, and both nodes may be connected to\ndepressed mood, indicating that tired, sleep-deprived people are more\nlikely to feel down and feel bad about themselves. (The connections\ncould run in the other direction too, from low mood to difficulty\nsleeping.) Eventually we see a set of connections stabilizing the\nnetwork as the symptoms of depression switch each other on and even\nsymptom nodes that are not directly connected influence each other via\nshared neighbours (Borsboom 2017, p.6).\n\nThe intuitive appeal of the network model relies on the idea that\nstandard conceptions of medical disease, with their separation of\nunderlying condition and visible symptom, make no sense in psychiatry\nand are implausibly reductive (Borsboom et al 2019, Borsboom 2017).\nHowever, it has been argued in response that the (Bringmann and Eronen\n2018) network and latent variable models are not so easy to\ndistinguish, and that the choice between them is orthogonal to\nquestions of reductionism. Further, although a disease such as\ndepression cannot function as a part of the network, we can include in\nthe network neurological or genetic processes that are taken to be part\nof the underlying state, so that the line between networks and\ntraditional models is blurry. Bringmann and Eronen\u2019s review of\nthe literature suggests that model choice should not be made on the\nbasis of background pictures of disease, but on the basis of other\nfactors, especially the dynamic relations among variables stressed by\nnetwork theorist. The philosophical appeal of a conception of mental\nillness by itself does not legitimate any choice of model.",
