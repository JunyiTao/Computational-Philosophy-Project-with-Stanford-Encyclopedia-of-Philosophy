    "main_text": "Reproduction and Replication || Multi-generation reproduction of phenotypes\n2.1 Multi-generation reproduction of phenotypes\n\nIn contrast to the replicator view that looks for reliably replicating\nentities that either produce copies of themselves, induce the\nproduction of such copies, or pass on their structure through\nreplication processes (Dawkins 1976; Hull 1980), the views discussed\nin what follows see natural selection as depending on the reliable\nmulti-generation reproduction or reconstruction of phenotypes, and\nconceptualize inheritance accordingly (for related discussion of the\ntopics in this section and historical details see the entry on\n replication).\n This perspective opens up many questions that the discussion of\ninheritance systems attempts to address. First among these is how\nhereditary resources or inheritance processes affect the development\nof offspring so as to reliably reconstruct parental phenotypic\ncharacters; this question is shared more generally by developmental\nevolutionary biology (Evo-Devo) and Developmental Systems Theory.\nReconstruction typically occurs during the development of the\noffspring, which is more or less independent from the parent, and may\nbe a complex, multi-stage, and temporally drawn out process. It may\ninvolve more than one inheritance system and depend on interactions\nbetween inheritance systems, depend on persistent environmental\nresources such as sunlight and gravity as well as environmental\nconditions produced by organisms and interactions with them (niche\nconstruction), and depend on processes such as pattern formation that\ngive rise to what might be characterized as emergent properties. We\nnow turn to a discussion of inheritance thus construed vis-a-vis the\nnotion of replication.\n",
