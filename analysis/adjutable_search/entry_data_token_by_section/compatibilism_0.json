    "main_text": "Free Will and the Problem of Causal Determinism\n1. Free Will and the Problem of Causal Determinism\n\nCompatibilism emerges as a response to a problem posed by causal\ndeterminism. But what problem is that? Well, suppose, as the thesis of\ncausal determinism tells us, that everything that occurs is the\ninevitable result of the laws of nature and the state of the world in\nthe distant past. If this is the case, then everything human agents do\nflows from the laws of nature and the way the world was in the distant\npast. But if what we do is simply the consequence of the laws of\nnature and the state of the world in the distant past\u2014then we\ncannot do anything other than what we ultimately do. Nor are we in any\nmeaningful sense the ultimate causal source of our actions, since they\nhave their causal origins in the laws of nature and the state of the\nworld long ago. Determinism therefore seems to prevent human agents\nfrom having the freedom to do otherwise, and it also seems to prevent\nthem from being the sources of their actions. If either of these is\ntrue, then it\u2019s doubtful that human agents are free or\nresponsible for their actions in any meaningful sense. \n\nThese lines of argument, which have been regimented in the work of\nGinet (1966), van Inwagen (1975, 1983), Wisdom (1934), Mele (1995),\nand Pereboom (1995, 2001), among many others, present a real problem\nfor those who are inclined to think that we are free and responsible\nfor our choices and actions and that the natural world might operate\nas a deterministic system (or if not completely deterministic, one in\nwhich an indeterminism is merely stochastic noise that is causally\nirrelevant at the level of human agency). How to respond to such\narguments? On the one hand, incompatibilists accept (some\nversion of at least one of) these arguments and so insist that our\nself-conception as free and responsible agents would be seriously\nmisguided if causal determinism turns out to be true. Some\nincompatibilists argue for these conclusions indirectly\u2014first by\narguing that determinism precludes freedom or control and then second\nby arguing that such freedom is necessary for moral responsibility.\nOther incompatibilists argue directly that causal determinism\nprecludes moral responsibility.\n\nCompatibilists, on the other hand, claim that these concerns miss the\nmark. Some compatibilists hold this because they think the truth of\ncausal determinism would not undermine our freedom to do otherwise\n(Berofsky 1987, Campbell 1997, Vihvelin 2013, etc.). As a result,\nthese compatibilists tell us, the truth of causal determinism poses no\nthreat to our status as morally responsible agents (notice the\nenthymematic premise here: the freedom to do otherwise is sufficient\nfor the kind of control an agent must possess to be morally\nresponsible for her actions). Other compatibilists show less concern\nin rebutting the conclusion that the freedom to do otherwise is\nincompatible with determinism. Compatibilists of this stripe reject\nthe idea that such freedom is necessary for meaningful forms of free\nwill (e.g., Frankfurt 1969, 1971; Watson 1975, Dennett 1984)\u2014the\n\u201cvarieties of free will worth wanting,\u201d (Dennett\n1984). And even more notably, some compatibilists simply deny that\nfreedom of this sort is in any way connected to morally responsible\nagency (e.g., Fischer 1994, Fischer & Ravizza 1998, Scanlon 1998,\nWallace 1994, Sartorio 2016). What we see here is not a unified front\nin the face of the incompatibilist challenge(s).  Instead,\ncompatibilists have been careful to identify the precise elements of\nincompatibilists\u2019 arguments that they take to be erroneous, and\nthen build their respective theories of freedom and responsibility\nwith that in mind. \n\nTo help better situate compatibilist theories, we will now consider in\nmore detail the arguments that incompatibilists have advanced on\nbehalf of their own theories, since it is these arguments that have\nshaped the contours of compatibilist theories. As we mentioned above,\nthe truth of causal determinism apparently poses a problem for freedom\nand responsibility in at least two ways. First, it might entail that\nno one has the freedom to do otherwise, which is a kind of\npower or control over one\u2019s actions that many have regarded as\nnecessary for moral responsibility. Second, it might entail that no\none is the ultimate causal source of his or her actions. That our\nactions originate in our free will and not in forces outside of us\nalso seems like a plausible condition on morally responsible agency.\nWe take each of these potential threats in turn.\n",
