    "main_text": "The Pluralists: Anaxagoras of Clazomenae and Empedocles of Acragas\n7. The Pluralists: Anaxagoras of Clazomenae and Empedocles of Acragas\n\nWhile Zeno and Melissus reinforced Parmenides\u2019 distinction\nbetween what-is (i.e., what must be) and what appears, other\npost-Parmenidean thinkers accepted Parmenides\u2019 arguments against\ncoming-to-be and passing-away (as characterizing what-is), and about\nthe stable nature of what is ultimately real, and argued that these\narguments did not rule out the possibility of metaphysically-based (or\nrational) cosmology. Both Anaxagoras and Empedocles worked within the\nParmenidean pattern while developing distinct cosmological systems\nthat addressed their own particular concerns (especially in the case\nof Empedocles, concerns about the proper way to live). \n\nAnaxagoras (writing in the mid-5th c.) claims, \u201cThe\nGreeks [i.e., ordinary people] do not think correctly about\ncoming-to-be and passing-away; for no thing comes to be or passes\naway, but is mixed together and dissociated from the things that are.\nAnd thus they would be correct to call coming-to-be mixing-together\nand passing-away dissociating\u201d (DK59B17/LM25D15). What seem to\nbe generated objects (human beings, plants, animals, the moon, the\nstars) are instead temporary mixtures of ingredients (such as earth,\nair, fire, water, hair, flesh, blood, dense, dark, rare, bright, and\nso on). Recent treatments of Anaxagoras (Marmodoro 2015, 2017) have\nsuggested that the ingredients are primarily powers that manifest\nthemselves in the mixtures\n produced.[7]\n The original state was universal mixture: \u201cAll things were\ntogether, unlimited both in amount and in smallness, for the small,\ntoo, was unlimited. And because all things were together, nothing was\nevident\u201d (DK59B1/LM25D9). This mixture is set into rotary motion\nby the operation of Mind (Nous \u2013 DK59B12/LM25D27,\nDKB13/LM25DD29b, DK59B14/LM25D28; see discussions in Laks 1993, Lesher\n1995, Menn 1995, Curd 2007), a separate cosmic entity that does not\nshare in such mixture. As the rotation spreads out through the\nunlimited mass of indistinguishably intermingled ingredients, the\nrotation causes a winnowing or separating effect, and the cosmos as we\nknow it emerges from the mixture. Moreover, not only were all\nthings together, they are even now all together, in a\ndifferent way, despite the differentiations now achieved. Everything\nis in everything (DK59B5, B6, B11/LM25D16, D25, D26), in some proportions, however small\nor great \u2013 this is a move to prevent even the appearance of\ncoming-to-be from what-is-not. \n\nAnaxagoras marks an important theoretical step in attributing the\nmotion of his ingredients to an independent, intelligent force\n(although both Plato and Aristotle were disappointed that his theory\nwas not properly\u2014from their point of view\u2014teleological; on\nthis see Sedley 2007, Curd 2018). The rotation begun by Mind is\ncausally responsible for the formation of the heavens and the\nactivities of the great masses of the earth and the water on the\nearth, as well as all meteorological phenomena. Insofar as the causes\nof the operations of the heavens and the phenomena apparent to us from\nday to day are the same at both the macro- and micro-level (the\nrotations that cause the apparent motions of the stars are the same as\nthose that govern the cycles of weather and life and death on earth),\nwe can infer the nature of what is real from what is apparent\n(Anaxagoras\u2019 scientific views are treated in Graham 2006 and\n2013). Although we do not perceive all things as being together, and\nthe move to the ultimate explanations is an inference, it is a\nlegitimate one (\u201cowing to their [the senses\u2019] feebleness,\nwe are not able to determine the truth\u201d yet \u201cappearances\nare a sight of the unseen\u201d DK59B21/LM25D5 and\nDK59B21a/LM25D6).\n\nA younger contemporary of Anaxagoras, Empedocles, who lived in Sicily,\nalso recognized the force of Parmenides\u2019 arguments against\ncoming-to-be and passing-away. (Empedocles also adopts\nParmenides\u2019 poetic meter in order to tell his story.) Empedocles\nproposes a cosmos formed of the four roots (as he calls them), earth,\nwater, air, and fire along with the motive forces of Love and Strife.\nIt is often claimed that, for Empedocles, Love simply produces mixture\nand Strife only causes separation. Empedocles\u2019 view is more\ncomplicated, for both forces mix and separate. Love unites opposed\n(unlike) things by pulling apart and then mixing these unlikes, while\nStrife sets unlikes in opposition and segregates them, hence Strife\nmixes like with like. Just as painters can produce fantastically\nlifelike scenes just by mixing colors, so the operations of Love and\nStrife, using just the four roots can produce \u201ctrees and men and\nwomen, and beasts and birds and water-nourished fish, and long-lived\ngods best in honors\u201d (31B17). These are the things that\nEmpedocles calls \u201cmortal,\u201d and he even provides recipes.\nDK31B73/LM22D73 tells how Kypris (the goddess Aphrodite, i.e. love)\nfashions shapes (or kinds): \u201cshe moistened earth in rain, and\ngave it to quick fire to harden.\u201d DK31B96/LM44D192 gives a\nrecipe for bones; flesh and blood both have the same recipe (earth,\nwater, air, and fire in equal proportions), but differ in the\nrefinement of the mixture (DK31B98/LM44D58a and D190). \n\nLike the other Presocratics, Empedocles has a cosmological theory, in\nhis case, an unending cycle involving the competition between Love and\nStrife. Love overcomes the separating influence of Strife, bringing\ntogether unlikes and so preventing the clinging together of likes. The\ntriumph of Love results in the Sphere, which is a complete mixture\nbecause the four unlike roots are as mixed (integrated) as possible.\nStrife breaks up the sphere by beginning to attract like to like and\nso pulling the mixture apart, until, when it triumphs, there is\ncomplete segregation of the roots. Love resists the separation of\nunlikes and the clinging together of likes, by trying to keep unlike\nthings mixed. The cosmos as we know it is a result of intermediate\nphases between the two extremes of the triumph of one of the\n forces.[8]\n\n\nAlthough Empedocles gives an account of the cosmos, cosmology is not\nhis sole interest. Both fragments and testimonia show his keen\nattention to questions about perception and its role in knowledge, the\nworkings of the body, and psychology. Like the Pythagoreans,\nEmpedocles thought that how one lived was as important as one\u2019s\ntheoretical commitments (and that the two were intimately connected).\nThe ancient evidence seems to suggest that Empedocles was the author\nof two works, commonly called in modern scholarship the\nPhysics and the Purifications, one cosmological and\nthe other ethico-religious. The relation between the two works has\nbeen a matter of some controversy. In the 1990s important new evidence\nfrom the Strasbourg Papyrus showed unequivocally that the cosmological\nand ethico-religious aspects of Empedocles\u2019 thought are\ninextricably intertwined (Martin and Primavesi 1999, Primavesi 2008,\nKingsley 1995), although commentators still disagree about whether\nthis new evidence supports the conclusion that there was a single poem\ncombining\n both.[9]\n The correct philosophical understanding of the physical world and the\ncorrect way to live cannot be separated from one another in\nEmpedocles\u2019 thought (a similar attitude appears in Heraclitus);\none cannot fully understand the world without living\n correctly.[10]\n Like the Pythagorean, the Empedoclean way of life included dietary\nrestrictions and a story of transmigrating daim\u014dns who\nseem to have some kind of personal identity. (Marmodoro 2016 is a\ncollection of recent work on Empedocles.)\n",
