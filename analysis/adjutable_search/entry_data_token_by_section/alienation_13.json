    "main_text": "Alienation and Value || Positive Element\n5.2 Positive Element\n\nIt is the second part of the claim which looks less obvious: that\nalienation is not a wholly negative phenomena, that is, that the loss\nor lack here may not always be the whole story, ethically speaking.\nNote, in particular, that some well-known accounts also locate an\nachievement of something of value in the moment of alienation. The resulting ethical\n\u2018gains\u2019 and \u2018losses\u2019 would then need to be weighed and\njudged overall.\n\nIn order to illustrate this possibility\u2014that alienation can\ninvolve the achievement of something of value\u2014consider the\nnuanced and critical celebration of capitalism found, but not always\nrecognised, in Marx\u2019s writings. One pertinent way of introducing\nthis account involves locating the moment of alienation within a\npattern of development that we might call \u2018dialectical\u2019 in\none sense of that slippery term.\n\nThe dialectical pattern here concerns the developing relationship\nbetween a particular subject and object: the individual, on the one\nhand, and their social role and community, on the other. By a\ndialectical progression is meant only a movement from a stage\ncharacterised by a relationship of \u2018undifferentiated\nunity\u2019, through a stage characterised by a relationship of\n\u2018differentiated disunity\u2019, to a stage characterised by a\nrelationship of \u2018differentiated unity\u2019.\nThere are no further claims made here about the necessity, the naturalness, or the\nprevalence, of such progressions (Cohen 1974: 237).\n\nThe dialectical progression here involves three historical\nstages:\n\nFirst, past (pre-capitalist) societies are said to\nembody undifferentiated unity. In this stage, individuals\nare buried in their social role and community, scarcely\nconceptualising, still less promoting, their own identity and\ninterests as distinguishable from those of the wider community.\n\nSecond, present (capitalist) societies are said to\nembody differentiated disunity. In this stage, independence\nand separation predominate, and individuals care only for themselves,\nscarcely thinking of the identity and interests of the wider\ncommunity. Indeed, they are typically isolated from, and indifferent\nor even hostile towards, the latter.\n\nThird, future (communist) societies are said to\nembody differentiated unity. In this stage, desirable\nversions of community and individuality flourish together. Indeed, in\ntheir new forms, communal and individual identities and communal and\nindividual interests presuppose and reinforce each other. It is\nsometimes said that the contents of the first two stages (community\nand individuality, respectively) have thereby been\n\u2018sublated\u2019\u2014that is, elevated, cancelled, and\npreserved\u2014in this third stage. \u2018Sublated\u2019 is an\nattempted English translation of the German verb\n\u2018aufheben\u2019and its cognates, which Hegel\noccasionally uses to suggest this elusive combination of ideas (e.g.\nHegel 1991b: \u00a724A3, \u00a781A1).\n\nIn the present context, the crucial historical stage is the second\none. This is the stage of alienation, the stage of disunity which\nemerges from a simple unity before reconciliation in a higher\n(differentiated) unity (Inwood 1992: 36). This is the stage associated\nwith present (capitalist) societies involving the problematic\nseparation of individuals from their social role and community. In the\nfirst historical stage (of past pre-capitalist societies) there is a\nproblematic relation, but no separation. And in the third historical\nstage (of future communist societies) there is a separation but it is\na healthy rather than problematic one. In this second historical stage\nof alienation, there is a loss, or lack, of something of value;\nroughly speaking, it is the loss or lack of the individuals\u2019\nattachment to their social role and community. (More precisely, we\nmight say that they have lost a sense of, and connection to, the\ncommunity, and that they lack a healthy sense of, and connection to,\nthe community.)\n\nHowever, this disvalue is not the whole of the historical story,\nethically speaking. In comparison with the first stage, the second\nstage also involves a liberation of sorts from the object in which\nsubjects were previously \u2018engulfed\u2019 (Cohen 1974: 239). The\n\u2018of sorts\u2019 is a way of acknowledging that this is a rather\ndistinctive kind of liberation. The individual here is not necessarily\nrid of the constraints of the other (of their social position and\ncommunity), but they do now at least identify and experience them as\nsuch\u2014that is, as constraints on the individual\u2014whereas\npreviously the individual was engulfed by that other and failed to\nthink of themselves as having any identity and interests outside of\ntheir social position. In short, the loss or lack of something of\nvalue is not the only feature of the second stage of alienation. There\nis also an important gain here, namely, the achievement of what we can\ncall \u2018individuality\u2019. This significant good was missing in\nthe first pre-capitalist stage, and\u2014freed from its present\ndistorting capitalist form\u2014it will be preserved and developed in\nthe communist future of the third historical stage.\n\nThis claim goes beyond the familiar suggestion that alienation forms a\nnecessary step in certain Hegelian and Marxist developmental\nnarratives. The suggestion here is that internal to the second stage,\nthe stage of alienation, there is both a problematic separation from\ncommunity and a positive liberation from engulfment. Those who see\nonly the negative thread in alienation, and fail to see \u2018what is\nbeing achieved within in and distorted by it\u2019, will miss an\nimportant, albeit subtle, thread in Marx\u2019s account of the\nprogressive character of capitalism (Cohen 1974: 253).\n\nThere is a lot going on in this schematic discussion of historical\nstages. The point emphasised here is that theorists\u2014even\ncritics\u2014of alienation need not assume that it is a wholly\nnegative phenomena, ethically speaking. Marx, for example, recognises\nthat the moment of alienation, for all its negative features, also\ninvolves the emergence of a good (individuality), which, in due course\n(and freed from the limitations of its historical origins), will be\ncentral to the human flourishing achieved in communist\nsociety.\n",
