Religious Liberty and Antidiscrimination Laws\n\nLike the right against discrimination, the right of religious liberty\nis enshrined in many domestic and international legal documents. Yet,\nthe two rights often seem to be in conflict with each other.  For\nclaims of religious liberty are frequently made by persons who wish to\nengage in activities that appear to amount to discrimination.  Of\nparticular importance are cases in which religious institutions and\nreligiously-motivated individuals claim to be exempt from the\nrequirements of antidiscrimination laws.\n \n\nClaims of religious exemption to antidiscrimination laws have recently\nbecome the center of political and legal controversy in the U.S. as a\nresult of the Obergefell case, in which the Supreme Court\nfound a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.  However, questions\nregarding the legal and moral validity of religious exemptions to such\nlaws extend well beyond the issue of same-sex marriage.  Moreover,\nmany liberal thinkers who support antidiscrimination laws balk at the\nidea that the laws ought to be applied willy-nilly to all religious\ninstitutions and religiously-motivated persons (Barry 2001:\n174\u201376; Eisgruber and Sager 2007: 65; Greenawalt 1998: 118;\nNussbaum 1999: 114; Galston 2002: 111; Laborde 2017: 175\u201390).\n\nIn the Hosanna-Tabor case (2012), the U.S. Supreme Court\nunanimously held that, under the Constitution, there was a\n\u201cministerial exception\u201d immunizing religious organizations\nfrom lawsuits brought against them by employees claiming that they had\nbeen illegally discriminated against by the organization.  The\nexception applies in the paradigmatic case to employees who perform\nreligious functions, such as ministers and priests, but the Court\nin Hosanna-Tabor ruled that the exception also applied in the\ncase of a church employee whose job was the teaching of secular\nsubjects.  The employee had brought her lawsuit under a statute\nprohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of disability.  The\nCourt held that the church was immune to the suit. \n\n\nChambers rejects the ministerial exception, even when it is limited to\nemployees who perform spiritual functions.  Accordingly, she argues\nthat the Roman Catholic Church should be legally prohibited, on the\nground of \u201cthe fundamental value of gender equality\u201d\n(2008: 141), from ordaining only men.  She points to the harms\nsuffered by women who wish to become priests but also the damage done\nto children who are taught by their Church that \u201cwomen are not\nfit to lead their fellow worshippers\u201d (141). And Chambers\ncontends that \u201cgender equality is \u2026 of sufficient importance\nto merit [legal] intervention\u201d (144) in a religious\norganization\u2019s choice of spiritual leaders.\n\nBy contrast, Laborde contends that \u201cthe government cannot\n[legitimately] force the Roman Catholic Church to ordain female\nclergy, as long as the established doctrine of the church is that only\nmen can be priests\u201d (2017: 180).  She argues that, if a certain\ngroup is a voluntary association \u201cthat individuals join to\npursue a conception of the good that is central to their\nidentity,\u201d then the group has a valid claim to \u201csome\nimmunity from the reach of antidiscrimination legislation\u201d\n(174).  Such immunity enables the members \u201cto live with\nintegrity,\u201d i.e., to live in accordance with \u201ctheir deep\ncommitments and beliefs\u201d (174). Laborde adds that any group\nclaiming an exemption from antidiscrimination law can be legitimately\nrequired to openly profess the discriminatory doctrine that is the\nbasis for its claim. \n\nAt the same time, Laborde rejects the scope of the ministerial\nexception as presented in Hosanna-Tabor. She contends that\nthe Court\u2019s ruling grants religious groups \u201can exorbitant\nright\u201d (177) that exceeds their valid moral claim to choose\ntheir own leaders and members.  Contra the ruling, Laborde\ndoes not think that the claim holds against the teachers of secular\nsubjects at church schools or any other employees whose jobs do not\nconsist in religious work.  Laborde agrees with the Court that the\nsecular judiciary should not address theological questions, but she\nrejects the Court\u2019s view that it is beyond the jurisdiction of\nthe judiciary to examine whether a proffered non-discriminatory\ntheological reason for an employment decision is merely a pretext for\nsome hidden discriminatory motive.\n\nWatson and Hartley also reject Chamber\u2019s view that the Catholic\nChurch should be legally forced to ordain women, arguing that her view\ndoes not hold for a pluralist society in which a church that refuses\nto ordain women is \u201cone among many\u201d (2018: 123), and\n\u201cvaried views about sex and gender\u201d (124) are held across\nthe society\u2019s religious institutions. Watson and Hartley write\nthat the doctrine of the male-only priesthood \u201cis not benign\nwhen it comes to the status of women as free and equal citizens, but\nits affect is blunted in the background culture by various other views\n\u201d (124).\n\nClaims for religious exemptions from antidiscrimination laws have also\nbeen made, not just by organizations, but by individuals acting on the\nbasis of their faith.  Watson and Hartley consider a case in which a\nwedding vendor refuses her services to same-sex couples, invoking her\nreligious belief that same-sex relationships are inherently sinful\n(cf. Masterpiece Cakeshop: 2018).  The vendor claims an\nexemption from a law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of\nsexual orientation.  Watson and Hartley argue that such an exemption\nis illegitimate, even if same-sex couples can avail themselves of the\nservices of other vendors in the area.  The vendor\u2019s claim to an\nexemption is a violation of the reciprocal respect that each citizen\nowes their fellow citizens, because the vendor is asking government to\nact in a way that cannot be justified to persons in same-sex\nrelationships as equal citizens.  In the view of Watson and Hartley,\nthe claim to an exemption rests on the premise that same-sex\nrelationships are inherently inferior to heterosexual ones.  They\nargue that such a premise is not admissible as a valid reason for the\npolicies of government, which, as a matter of justice, must justify\nits actions to all its citizens in a way that respects their equality.\nAnd it is not reasonable to think that anyone in a same-sex\nrelationship can accept the premise of inferiority.  More generally,\nWatson and Hartley contend that \u201callowing public discrimination\non the basis of factors such as sexual orientation, sex, or race\ncreates a kind of second-class citizenship\u201d (2018: 117-118),\nwhich violates the demands of justice. \n\nVallier develops an approach that is more accommodating of religious\nexemptions. He writes that exemptions are justified \u201cin a wide\narray of cases,\u201d perhaps including that of \u201cbakers [of\nwedding cakes] who wish to deny service to homosexual couples on\nreligious grounds\u201d (2016: 17).  Vallier explains that the bakers\nhave a reason, from their point of view, to oppose an\nantidiscrimination law that protects same-sex couples. Moreover, the\nreason is both intelligible to any reasonable member of the public,\nand, because the reason is rooted in \u201cprojects and principles\nthat possess great normative weight\u201d (14) for the bakers, it is\nsufficient from their perspective to reject the law as applied to\nthem. On Vallier\u2019s account, the bakers, then, merit an\nexemption, as long as the exemption \u201cdoes not impose significant\ncosts on other parties that require redress\u201d (3). \n\nVallier understands that many people will argue that the exemption\ndoes in fact impose significant harms on same-sex couples denied\nservices afforded heterosexual couples, but he responds to that\nargument by citing \u201cmore traditional liberal views\u201d on\nwhich \u201ca denial of service will not count as harmful because, in\nnearly all of the relevant cases, gay and lesbian couples have dozens\nof affordable alternative venues to purchase wedding cakes\u201d\n(18).  \n\nWatson and Hartley reject the \u201cmore traditional liberal\nviews\u201don the ground that, even if there are alternative venues\nat which same-sex couples can be served, the couples are still treated\nas second-class citizens, because they are denied on grounds of the\nalleged inferiority of their partnership the full range of services\noffered to the public.  Vallier might reply that equal citizenship is\nsecured as long as the couples have alternative venues, but it is not\nclear how convincing such a reply is, given his admission that the\nactions of the bakers \u201ccan stigmatize homosexual couples through\ntheir denial of service\u201d (17). It would seem that the stigma\namounts to a stamp of inferiority, publicly-enacted through\nexclusionary actions and affixed to persons in same-sex partnerships,\nregardless of the availability to them of alternative venues. \n\n\nAt the same time, Vallier might argue that his analysis of the case of\nthe bakers is on all fours with Watson and Hartley\u2019s account of\nthe male-only priesthood case, in which they contend that an exemption\nis legitimate: the effect of the bakers\u2019 views on same-sex\ncouples, he might say, \u201cis blunted in the background culture by\nvarious other views\u201d (Watson and Hartley 2018: 124) and by the\navailability of alternative venues for the couples. \n\n\nHowever, Watson and Hartley would reply that there is an important\ndistinction between a church, which is a \u201cprivate association,\ncomposed of individuals who affirm, roughly, the same doctrine,\u201d\nwhile a bake shop is a \u201cbusiness of public accommodation\u201d\n(125).  Yet, the question arises: If the social effects on gender\ninequality of the Catholic Church\u2019s male-only priesthood can be\nsufficiently blunted by the background culture, why are the parallel\neffects of anti-gay bake shops on the equal citizenship of gays not\nlikewise blunted? \n\n\nIt seems that, for Watson and Hartley, the decisive consideration in\nthe bake shop/wedding vendor cases is not a matter of causal effects\non society but rather of how persons are treated in the public sphere,\nwhere citizens owe one another treatment as free and equal persons.\nWatson and Hartley regard the bake shop and all other commercial\nenterprises that offer goods and services to the general public as\nbelonging to the public sphere, and they contend that the denial of\nservices on grounds of sexual orientation violates what citizens owe\none another in that sphere, because such a denial constitutes treating\ncitizens in same-sex partnerships as inferior to citizens in\nheterosexual ones. \n\n\nVallier\u2019s view requires a different account of what citizens owe\neach other.  The \u201cmore traditional liberal views\u201d to which\nhe refers contend that commercial enterprises should be placed in the\nprivate sphere and that antidiscrimination laws applying to\nprivately-owned businesses are thereby illegitimate (see Epstein 1995\nand the Civil Rights Cases 1883).  But Vallier does not appear to\nembrace that aspect of the traditional liberal views, instead arguing\nthat the disparaging treatment of gays by the bakers is made\npermissible (in part) by the fact that gays can receive service at\nother bake shops.  The underlying premise appears to be that it is not\nreally a duty of citizens to treat one another as equals, even in the\npublic sphere. For if the bakers did have a duty to treat all of their\nfellow citizens, including gays, as equals in that sphere, then the\nbakers could not be relieved of the duty on the ground that there were\nother citizen-bakers who did treat gays as equals. I am not morally\nlicensed to treat you with disrespect if only there are many others\nwho treat you respectfully. So the disagreement between Vallier and\nWatson/Hartley seems to come down to the issue of exactly what duties\ncitizens owe one another, which in turn rests on the large question of\nwhat a society of free and equal citizens would look like.\n",
