    "main_text": "The Question of Coherence\n2. The Question of Coherence\n\nThe very notion of an ontologically simple being will be dismissed by\nmany as self-evidently incoherent. Among theists, there are those who\nwill argue that DDS does not cohere with some other theistic\ncommitment such as the doctrine of the Trinity. The main concern of\nthis article is not with such intramural coherence questions, but with\nthe question of whether or not DDS is coherent at all. This broad\ncoherence question is not whether the doctrine is true, or even\npossibly true; the question is whether it is possible for us to think\nit without obvious contradictions and category mistakes. Ultimately,\nthe broad coherence question concerns the sort of general metaphysical\nframework that would allow DDS to be discussed as a live option as\nopposed to being dismissed as incoherent from the outset.\n\nA central threat to coherence is the question of how a thing could be\nidentical to its properties. Alvin Plantinga (1980, 47) maintains that\nif God is identical to his properties, then he is a property, and they\nare a single property, in which case God is a single property. Given\nthat properties are abstract entities, and abstracta are causally\ninert, then God is abstract and causally inert \u2014 which is of\ncourse inconsistent with the core tenet of classical theism according\nto which God is the personal creator and sustainer of every contingent\nbeing. No abstract object is either a person or a causal agent. No\nabstract object can be omniscient, or indeed know anything at all.\nMore fundamentally, no abstract entity can be identical to any\nconcrete entity. God as person and creator is concrete. Abstracta and\nconcreta are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. Nothing can be\nboth. Objections similar to Plantinga\u2019s have been raised by\nRichard Gale (1991, 23 ff.), William Hasker (2016, 703) and\nothers.\n\nIt is easy to see that Plantinga-style objections will not appear\ndecisive to those who reject his metaphysical framework. Indeed,\nPlantinga\u2019s accusations of category mistake may strike students\nof the main medieval proponents of DDS as so many misunderstandings\nbased on a foisting of a foreign framework on their ideas. Plantinga,\nalong with many other philosophers, thinks of individuals and\nproperties as belonging to disjoint categories connected by an\nexternal relation of exemplification. Individuals are causally\nefficacious concreta whereas properties are causally impotent\nabstracta. Such an approach to ontology renders the divine simplicity\ninconceivable from the outset. For if God is a concrete individual and\nhis nature (conceived perhaps as the conjunction of his\nomni-attributes) is an abstract property, then the general ontology\nrules out any identity or sameness of God and his nature. Any such\nidentity or sameness would violate the separateness of the two\ncategories. To identify an unexemplifiable concretum with an\nexemplifiable abstractum would amount to a category mistake. At most,\na Plantinga-style approach allows for God\u2019s\nexemplification of his nature where the (first-level)\nexemplification relation, unlike the identity relation, is\nasymmetrical and irreflexive and so enforces the non-identity of its\nrelata. In short, if God exemplifies his nature, then God must be\ndistinct from his nature, just as Socrates must be distinct from his\nnature. God\u2019s nature is then something he has, by\nexemplification, not, pace Augustine, something he is by some\nform of identity or sameness.\n",
