Moral responses to\nrevolutions are often ambivalent or deeply polarized. On the one hand,\nrevolutions promise to be powerful engines of moral progress, allowing\na community to abolish an oppressive social order and providing the\nopportunity to institute a better one. On the other hand, revolutions\nrisk unravelling the fabric of political community and devolving into\nbloody, prolonged conflicts that only manage to reinstate a new\noppressive regime. In this entry, we will clarify the concept of\nrevolution and then go on survey the complex moral issues surrounding\npolitical revolutions.\n\nSection 1 discusses conceptual issues, distinguishing between\ndifferent understandings of revolution and between violent and\nnonviolent revolution; it also distinguishes revolution from\nresistance, rebellion, and secession. Section 2 outlines in broad\nrelief some of the major historical views on the morality of\nrevolution. Section 3 applies the moral framework developed by\ncontemporary just war theory to examine complications facing the\njustification of resorting to revolutionary war (revolutionary jus\nad bellum).

Conceptual Matters\n\nSeveral terms are used to denote extra-constitutional rejection of an\nexisting government\u2019s authority, either tout court or\nin some particular domain: resistance, rebellion, secession,\nrevolution. Resistance need not be total; it can instead involve\ndisobeying some particular law or laws or efforts to thwart only some\nof a government\u2019s policies or the government\u2019s attempt to\nperform particular actions; and resistance can take a number of forms,\nincluding acts of disobedience that are not only public but designed\nto achieve maximal publicity (as in the case of civil disobedience),\nas well as covert acts of noncompliance; and it may also be either\npeaceful or nonviolent and disruptive or not. Rebellion, usefully\ndistinguished from resistance, involves a wholesale rejection of\ngovernment\u2019s authority. But the government\u2019s authority\ncould be rejected for quite different reasons: to do away with\ngovernment altogether (the anarchist\u2019s goal), to establish a new\ngovernment with the same domain of territorial authority, to create a\nnew territorial unit out of part of the territory ruled by the\nexisting government (secession), or to sever part of the territory of\nthe government and join it to another existing state (irredentist\nsecession).\n\nRevolution is commonly understood to have two components: rejection of\nthe existing government\u2019s authority and an attempt to replace it\nwith another government, where both involve the use of forceful\nextra-constitutional means. On this reading, revolution and rebellion\nshare a negative aim, the wholesale rejection of a government\u2019s\nauthority, but revolution includes in addition a positive aim, to\ninstitute a new government in place of the one it has destroyed. Note\nthat on our use of the term, \u201cconstitution\u201d is meant to\nrefer to something broader than foundational legal principles or a\nfoundational legal document. Rather, we understand a constitution to\nexist when there is coordination among a sufficient number of members\nof some group on some basic rules for collective decision-making. On\nour understanding, then, a bargain struck among military elites\ndefining roles in a society run by a military junta counts as a\nconstitution, and a popular militant uprising that aimed at displacing\nsuch a regime would thus count as a revolution.\n\nSome important empirical work relevant to the morality of\nrevolutionary war is to be found in studies of civil war. The latter\nis sometimes defined as a large-scale armed conflict between state\nforces and one or more nonstate parties. This definition may be too\nrestrictive, however, since it would exclude a large-scale armed\nconflict between two or more nonstate parties under conditions in\nwhich the government had disintegrated entirely or still existed but\nwas not capable of fielding forces. A broader understanding of civil\nwar that would encompass that kind of case would be simply that of a\nlarge-scale intrastate armed conflict.\n\nThe preceding terms are not always used in this way in actual\npolitical discourse. For example, the government of the United States\nlabeled the secession of the Southern states from the Union a\nrebellion, while many Confederates called their enterprise the Second\nAmerican Revolution; and the American colonists who strove to secede\nfrom the British Empire tended to call themselves revolutionaries, not\nsecessionists or rebels. (It may be that the Americans avoided the\nterm \u201crebel\u201d because they thought it had negative\nconnotations). Similarly, the Algerian secession from France is often\nreferred to as the Algerian Revolution and wars of colonial liberation\nare rarely called secessionist conflicts, though their goal is\nsecession from a political order centered on a metropolitan state\nwhose territory is not adjacent to the colony. In what follows, the\nterm \u201crevolution\u201d will be reserved for\nextra-constitutional attempts to destroy an existing national\ngovernment and replace it, to the full extent of its territorial\nauthority, with a new government. On this way of sorting out the\nvarious terms, secessionists and revolutionaries are necessarily\nrebels, while rebels need be neither secessionists nor revolutionaries\n(they may be anarchists), and secessionists as such are not\nrevolutionaries.\n\nSometimes the term \u201crevolution\u201d is used in a stronger\nsense, as denoting not just an extra-constitutional attempt to replace\none government with another, but also to effect a fundamental change\nin the type of government, as in a revolution to replace an autocracy\nwith a democracy. Thus some scholars on the Left have contended that\nthe so-called American Revolution was not really a revolution, because\nit did not create or even aim at anything other than a new form of the\nbourgeois state\u2014a state controlled by and in the interest of the\nclass that controls the means of production (Zinn 1980, Jennings\n2000). Many American historians have concluded otherwise, asserting\nthat it was a revolution in the stronger sense because it replaced a\nmonarchy with a republic (Nash 2005; Wood 1993). On this stronger\nunderstanding of revolution as involving a fundamental change in the\ntype of government, secessionists would also be revolutionaries, if\nthe new government they attempt to establish in part of the territory\nof the state would be of a fundamentally different type. For the\nremainder of the discussion, we will use \u201crevolution\u201d in\nthe weaker sense, with the understanding that it can also encompass\nrevolutions in the stronger sense. It is worth noting, however, that\nthe morality of revolution in the stronger sense is, if anything, more\ncomplex than that of the weaker sense, because the former involves not\nonly the extra-constitutional overthrow of the existing government but\nalso the extra-constitutional establishment of a new type of\ngovernment.\n\nOne more distinction is needed. Revolutions may be violent or\nnonviolent and may begin nonviolently and become violent. This\ndistinction, though obviously important, is not so crisp as one might\nthink, because what counts as violence may be disputed. For example,\nattempts to overthrow a government by disruptive techniques (for\nexample conducting general strikes, disabling power grids, or blocking\nmain transportation routes) are not violent in the way in which\ndischarging firearms or detonating explosives is, but they may\nnonetheless cause lethal harms. The chief topic of this entry is\nviolent revolution where \u201cviolence\u201d is understood in the\nmost robust way and as occurring on a large scale; in other words, the\ntopic is revolutionary war as \u201cwar\u201d is usually understood\n(Singer & Small 1994: 5).\n\nIt is well worth noting, however, that there is a position on\nrevolution that obviates the need for a theory of just revolutionary\nwar, namely, the view that large-scale revolutionary violence is never\nmorally justified because the risks of such an endeavor are so great\nand because nonviolent revolution is more efficacious. Some empirical\npolitical scientists have argued that there is good evidence that\nnonviolent revolution is more likely to achieve its ends than\nrevolutionary war (Chenoweth & Stephan 2011). Even if that is true\nas a generalization, the question remains as to whether there are\nexceptions\u2014cases where nonviolence is not likely to achieve the\naims of just revolution or would only achieve them with undue costs in\nterms of human well-being\u2014and whether they can be identified\nex ante. If there are any such cases, there is a need for a\ntheory of just revolutionary war.\n2. Some Major Figures\u2019 Views on the Morality of Revolution\n\nNo attempt can be made here to conduct a survey of views on revolution\nacross the history of Western Philosophy, much less one that\nencompasses other traditions. Instead, it must suffice to say that the\ntypical attitude toward revolution of major figures in the Western\ntradition prior to the modern period was to condemn it or to\nacknowledge its moral permissibility only in very narrow circumstances\n(Morkevicius 2014). Augustine (City of God) and Aquinas\n(Summa theologiae), for example, both condemn rebellion and\nhence revolution, unambiguously urging obedience to the powers that\nbe. Su\u00e1rez (1609) held that only \u201clesser\nmagistrates\u201d had the authority to try to overthrow an existing\ngovernment, with the implication that revolution by those who do not\nalready occupy official roles is never justified. Hobbes (1651),\nexplicitly denied that revolution could ever be justified, holding\ninstead that a subject could only rightly resist government authority\nas a matter of self-defense and then only when the perpetration of\nlethal harm against her was imminent.\n\nPerhaps the most famous condemnation of revolutions comes from\nImmanuel Kant. According to Kant, revolution is never justified,\nregardless of the extent to which political power is abused. He\nwrites: \u201cThe reason a people has a duty to put up with even what\nis held to be an unbearable abuse of supreme authority is that its\nresistance to the highest legislator can never be regarded as other\nthan contrary to law, and indeed as abolishing the entire legal\nconstitution\u201d (Ak 6:320). Kant\u2019s unqualified rejection of\nthe possibility of justified revolution is based in his understanding\nof individual rights as inherently relational. For Kant, the Universal\nPrinciple of Right dictates that constraints on individual freedom are\nto be such that they are compatible with the freedom of all under\nuniversal law (Ak 6:230\u20131). Rights are constituted by claims\nconcerning the conduct of others, but individuals are not in a\nposition to unilaterally enforce those claims. Individual enforcement\nof a rights claim amounts to an individual imposing his will and\ninterpretation of the situation on another, and this kind of\nimposition is impermissible as a basic matter of justice.\nConsequently, a juridical, omnilateral will that is not party to\nrights relations is necessary to enforce rights claims in a way that\nis compatible with the Universal Principle of Right. The state is such\na will. Hence, submission to the state is a necessary condition of\nachieving the juridical conditions of mutual freedom that are required\non grounds of the Universal Principle of Right (for much more detailed\ndiscussions, see: Hill 2002, Korsgaard 2008, Flikschuh 2008).\nRevolution is never justified because it lacks rightful authority.\n\nThe anti-revolutionary arguments just surveyed can be summarized in\nthe following terms. First is the Undue Risk Argument, according to\nwhich the prospect of violent anarchy that follows an attempted\nrevolution is so great that it defeats any other reasons that purport\nto justify political revolution. Second is the Conceptual Argument\noffered by Kant, according to which acts that instigate revolution can\nnever satisfy the requirement of rightful authority, and so are\nnecessarily unjustified.\n\nA number of figures in the history of political thought have opposed\nsuch anti-revolutionary positions. The monarchomachs in late\n16th century France argued that their monarchy was\nunjustified and advocated for revolution and tyrannicide. Francois\nHotman defended this claim by arguing that the French constitution was\nfundamentally based in an assembly of the nation, and the author of\nVindicie contra Tyrannos, publishing under the pseudonym\nStephanus Junius Brutus, argued that subjects are never bound to obey\na prince that oversteps God\u2019s law and that subjects are entitled\nto resist a King that deviates from his divine duties (for an overview\nof the monarchomachs, see Dunning 1904). In his work De Jure Regni\napud Scotos, the Scottish thinker George Buchanan argues for an\nearly conception of popular sovereignty according to which the people\nare entitled to resist and punish tyrants (Macmillan 2016 [1906]\nprovides a comprehensive biography of Buchanan\u2019s life and\nsummary of his political thought).\n\nThe most prominent defense of revolution in the liberal tradition was\noffered by John Locke, according to which revolution is both justified\nand permissible when the state breaches its duty to protect the\nnatural rights of persons (1689, chapter XIX). On Locke\u2019s social\ncontract theory, the state is formed to protect individual rights and\nresolve disputes between persons concerning their rights. The state\nthus acts as a trustee of the rights of individuals, and violation of\nthose rights amounts to a breach of trust (Simmons 1993, pp.\n157\u20138). If the trust is breached, the rights entrusted to the\nstate are returned to civil society, members of which are then\nentitled to defend against violations of those rights through the use\nof force (Locke 1689, section 227, on rights returning to civil\nsociety see Simmons 1993, pp. 171\u20132). We can thus summarize the\ncore of Locke\u2019s view on revolution in terms of the Self-Defense\nArgument, according to which revolution is justified against some\nstate S when S breaches its fiduciary obligation to protect individual\nnatural rights, then the authority to protect these rights returns to\nthe people (for a discussion contrasting Kant\u2019s and\nLocke\u2019s views of revolution, see Flikschuh 2008).\n\nLocke took a more favorable stance toward revolution than Hobbes or\nhis medieval predecessors because he did not believe that the risks of\nphysical insecurity attendant upon the destruction of an existing\ngovernment were as high as those thinkers did. That more optimistic\nview as grounded, in turn, in his belief that the destruction of the\npolitical order need not entail the destruction of society\u2014that\nis, of social practices and habits that effectively control the most\nserious forms of violence (Simmons 1993, p. 171). It is a mistake,\nhowever, to conclude either that Hobbes was right and Locke was wrong\nor vice versa about the consequences for physical security of\nthe destruction of government. A more reasonable view is that the\nrisks of the destruction of government and hence of revolution vary,\ndepending upon the circumstances. If that is so, and if the\njustifiability of revolution depends even in part on the severity of\nthe risks of physical insecurity it involves, then it appears that the\ncontent of a moral theory of revolution must be shaped by empirical\nconsiderations. We return to this point in the subsequent section,\nwhere we introduce a distinction between the different kinds of social\ncontexts within which revolutions take place.\n\nWhereas liberal political philosophers have tended to frame the\njustification for revolution in terms of natural rights and justice,\nrevolution in the Marxist tradition is understood quite differently.\nThere is one strain of Marx interpretation according to which he\nrejects rights-talk altogether, either in favor of the discourse of\nconflicting interests or in favor of the vocabulary of\nself-realization or mankind\u2019s overcoming of alienation from its\n\u201cspecies being\u201d (Buchanan 1982). On this interpretation,\nMarx held that the very concept of rights is an ideological construct\nthat is fostered by and in turn reinforces the egoistic psychology of\nbourgeois society and will be discarded once the transition to\ndeveloped communist society occurs. If the very concept of rights is\nthus both tainted and fated for obsolescence, then the question arises\nas to how else the justification for proletarian revolution might be\nframed (Finlay 2006). One answer that is consistent at least with the\nearly writings of Marx is that proletarian revolution is needed to\ndestroy the conditions of alienation and create the conditions for the\nfull realization of man\u2019s nature as a creative, communal being,\nthe sort of being who will, through processes of scientifically\ninformed collective decision-making, bring the natural and social\nworld fully under deliberate human control for the good of all\n(Economic & Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, in\nMER: 66\u2013125).\n\nEven if Marx thought that successful revolution could be correctly\ndescribed as the overcoming of alienation or more positively as the\nrealization of human \u201cspecies being\u201d, it is doubtful that\nhe thought that proletarian revolution needed to be justified\nin this or any other way. There is, after all, a Marx who derides\n\u201cmoralistic\u201d socialists and who seems to hold that\nsuccessful proletarian revolution is a matter of the historically\ninevitable realization of the common interests of the proletariat, and\nthat the revolution will be effectively motivated by those interests,\nnot by a commitment to any moral principle (On the Division of\nLabor in Production in MER: 683\u2013717). Such\nan interpretation fits well with Marx\u2019s understanding of his\ntheory of history as scientific and realistic. According to this\naccount, the question of whether revolution is justified is idle; it\nwill occur, because the revolution in the mode of production that\nmarks the transition from capitalism to communism will produce a\nfundamental transformation of all social relationships that will carry\nhuman beings beyond the state and beyond politics (Critique of the\nGotha Programme, Part IV, 1875 in MER:\n525\u2013541). On this reading, Marx does not offer a justification\nof revolution so much as he offers an explanation for why a certain\nkind of revolution must (on his view) occur (for a discussion\ncomparing Kant and Marx\u2019s views that argues against the\namoralist reading of Marx, see Ypi 2014)\n\nBy way of summary and as a broad generalization, it is fair to say\nthat at least since the time of Locke, the dominant view on revolution\nin Western Political Philosophy, both in the Liberal and Marxist\ntraditions, and perhaps in popular political culture as well, has been\nconsiderably more permissive than that of Hobbes and Kant and their\nmedieval predecessors. For the remainder of this entry, we will assess\nvarious morally relevant features of revolutions, drawing on insights\ndeveloped in contemporary just war theory.\n3. Revolutionary Jus ad Bellum\n\nContemporary just war theory provides a sophisticated framework for\nassessing the morality of political revolution (see the entry on\n war).\n Just war theory is relevant because revolutions typically involve the\nlarge-scale use of force, both by revolutionaries and by the regime\nthat attempts to thwart their efforts. Locke\u2019s argument in\nsupport of revolution has already illustrated this connection between\nrevolution and just war because he conceives of revolution as an act\nof collective self-defense against usurpers of legitimate\npolitical power.\n\nIn this section, then, we will examine how the satisfaction of typical\njus ad bellum standards faces complications in the case of\nrevolutionary war. Before turning to this analysis, we must introduce\na key distinction concerning the social context of revolutions. The\nsocial context that a revolution takes place in can lead to variation\nwith respect to how violent a given revolution is, a crucial parameter\nfor assessing whether the conditions of jus ad bellum\nobtain.\n\nHow bloody and protracted a revolution is and whether it will be\nsuccessful will in part be a function of how well-organized and\neffective revolutionary leadership is. Accordingly, we will\ndistinguish between what we call Hobbesian revolutionary\ncontexts and Lockean revolutionary contexts. In Lockean\ncontexts, revolutionaries have access to institutional structures,\neither formal or informal, that they can rely on to solve two basic\nproblems: the cooperation problem (mobilizing a sufficient number of\nrevolutionaries) and the coordination problem (organizing the\nrevolutionaries in an effective manner). In Hobbesian contexts, by\ncontrast, such institutional resources are absent.\n\nHobbesian and Lockean contexts thus described are ideal types, with\nmost actual revolutions occurring in contexts that fall somewhere in\nbetween the ideal types. The American Revolution took place in a\nLockean context, insofar as revolutionaries had access to colonial\nlegislatures, through participation in which they had developed skills\nin organization and leadership. These institutional resources enabled\nAmerican revolutionaries to solve the cooperation and coordination\nproblems and to do so through relatively peaceful, democratic means.\nThe early stages of the Russian Revolution, in contrast, took place\nunder Hobbesian conditions, resulting in division and conflict among\nrevolutionary factions and uncoordinated violence by relatively small\ngroups (e.g. mutinying soldiers or striking laborers) acting\nindependently. In the Russian case, as opposed to the American one,\nthe process by which the cooperation and coordination problems were\nsolved did not provide the group that eventually took control of the\nrevolution, the Bolsheviks, with experience in non-coercive,\nrelatively democratic leadership.\n\nCrucially, the social context of a revolution is not fixed because, as\nSkopcol emphasizes, revolutions, to the extent that they are\nsuccessful, involve the creation of new state structures (Skocpol\n2015). Further, the context in which a revolution occurs can also\nchange prior to the successful seizure of sufficient power to build a\nnew state structure. One example of the latter kind is found in the\nIranian Revolution. This revolution began with widespread but\nuncoordinated student protests which, following some student deaths,\nwere transformed by Ayatollah Khomeini into an organized mass protest\nmovement. The institutional resource Khomeini utilized was a network\nof pre-existing religious institutions.\n\nIt will be important to keep in mind the distinction between Hobbesian\nand Lockean revolutionary contexts in order to avoid over generalizing\nabout the risks of revolution. If one assumes, if only implicitly,\nthat revolutions occur in predominantly Lockean conditions, one will\nbe predisposed to rate the risk of anarchy and extreme violence low\nand consequently take a more permissive stance on the justification of\nrevolution. If one assumes that Hobbesian conditions are predominant,\none will infer that the risks of revolution are great and be\npredisposed to regard revolutions as unjustified. Keeping in mind the\nneed to avoid over-generalization, we now turn to a consideration of\nhow standard jus ad bellum criteria apply to revolutions or\nat least to revolutions that are, like most revolutions, likely to\ninvolve large-scale collective violence.\n\nConsider first the just cause requirement. Some causes for revolution\nwe can set aside immediately, namely, those that are patently unjust.\nIt is not a legitimate aim of revolution, for example, to displace a\nliberal state that is reasonably effective at protecting basic human\nrights in order to institute a theocracy that will violate basic human\nrights. Nor would a revolution to institute or preserve slavery be\njustified. More appropriate targets of revolution are Resolute Severe\nTyrannies, defined as regimes that persistently violate some of the\nbasic human rights of large segments of the population, are extremely\nauthoritarian (that is, wholly undemocratic), and are utterly\nimpervious to efforts to reform them (Buchanan 2013, p. 296).\n\nThe moral stakes of opposing a Resolute Severe Tyranny will depend on\nwhich human rights are being violated. When relatively basic rights\nsuch as rights to one\u2019s life, body, or the conditions necessary\nfor subsistence are being violated, then officials and agents of the\nregime are plausibly liable to immediate defensive harm in the\nindividual cases where such violations arise and ending such\nsystematic violation of basic rights is a just cause for armed\nresistance of the regime (Finlay 2015, pp. 78). Tyrannies can be less\nsevere when the human rights they violate are relatively less urgent\nthan these basic rights, which would include political rights or\nrights against discrimination.\n\nWhile there might be cause for replacing a tyrannical regime, the\njustification of revolution encounters a complication when it comes to\ndetermining what kind of government or institutional arrangement ought\nto replace the regime if the revolution proves successful. This\nproblem is especially acute under Hobbesian conditions because\nrevolutionaries have repudiated or cannot avail themselves of existing\npolitical processes for determining political aims and have not yet\ndeveloped new processes for performing that task (at least in the\nearlier stages of the struggle). There may be serious disagreement\namong revolutionaries as to what the goal of the revolution is, with\nno nonviolent, much less legitimate process for resolving it. If\nrevolutionaries lack the institutional resources to determine a common\nunderstanding of what the new political order is to be, then the task\nof evaluating the justness of a revolutionary struggle becomes more\ndifficult. It may be a mistake to say \u201cX is the aim of\nthe revolutionary war-makers\u201d because there may be no one aim\nand the plurality of aims may be mutually inconsistent, with some\nbeing just and others being unjust. In certain contexts, then, the\ncause of a political revolution, its justifying aim, may be\nindeterminate.\n\nThough the cause of revolution may be indeterminate or unjust, it does\nnot follow that joining the fight, once it has started, is necessarily\nwrong or unjust (Buchanan 2013). Whether various individuals are\nmorally justified in joining the war effort depends upon whether they\nhave morally acceptable reasons for doing so, not upon the morality or\nimmorality of the actions others took to initiate the conflict. The\njustification for initiating revolution will be different from the\njustification for joining a revolution. This point is not limited to\nrevolutionary wars, but it may be more significant in the\nrevolutionary case, if generally speaking the initiation of\nrevolutionary wars is harder to justify than some interstate wars,\nespecially wars of self-defense or defense of others against\naggression.\n\nConsider now to the proportionality criterion, applied to\nrevolutionary war. Proportionality is satisfied when the moral\nsignificance of the goods achieved through revolution is greater than\nthe significance of the \u201cbads\u201d or harms or\nrights-violations that will be brought about by revolutionary\nconflict. As Richard Norman and David Rodin argue, the moral urgency\nof political rights seems to be categorically inferior to the\nsignificance of rights to life and limb that will be violated and\nthreatened by revolutionary war, thus making revolutionary war against\ntyrannies that only violate political rights unjustified (Norman 1995:\n128; Rodin 2002: 48). In a similar vein, Jonathan Parry argues that\nrevolutionaries are at a moral disadvantage when it comes to the\nsatisfaction of proportionality. That is because, on Parry\u2019s\nview, in order for some interests to count in the proportionality\ncalculus, the persons to whom those interests are tied must consent to\nthe use of force to protect those interests. And, since\nrevolutionaries are generally less likely to receive consent, this\nmeans that there will be fewer interests that count in favor of\nrevolutionary violence (Parry 2018).\n\nThere are a number of replies that one might offer in response to\nthese challenges concerning proportionality. First, one can argue that\nthe moral significance of the violation of relatively less urgent\nrights aggregates to a cost that is great enough to be proportionate\nto a relatively lesser number of harms to more urgent rights that will\nbe suffered as a consequence of violent revolution (McMahan 2004).\nThis aggregationist argument can also be bolstered by identifying\nfurther goods advanced by revolution. The effects of revolutionary war\nagainst \u201clesser tyranny\u201d on valid norm compliance\nmight also be included. Supposing that it is a valid norm that\ngovernments abstain from harming their citizens and respect the\npolitical liberties of citizens. If international institutions are so\nweak as to be unable to enforce this norm, then the best prospect for\nenforcing a norm of good government is the threat of revolution\nagainst governments that violate the norm. Under these conditions, it\nwould be problematic to restrict proportionality assessments to\nimmediate, direct harms, ignoring the effects on the enforcement of\nimportant norms of justice. Second, one could argue that a regime that\nviolates relatively less urgent rights does so by virtue of issuing a\nconditional threat, explicit or implicit, and that therefore the\nregime is responsible for escalation in conflict that occurs because\nof an assertion of the relatively less urgent rights by individuals,\nand use of force in response to such escalation is justified (McMahan\n1994; Finlay 2015: 63\u201376). Third, one could argue that\nproportionality is sensitive to responsibility, such that when one is\nresponsible for some harm or rights violation then the threshold of\nproportionality is lessened to some extent. So, if a regime is\nresponsible for violations of relatively less urgent human rights,\nthen this fact may make members of the regime liable to a degree of\nforce that would not have otherwise been proportionate (Kapelner\n2019). Fourth, one could argue that revolutions respond to a\ndistinctive kind of wrong that changes the proportionality calculus in\nfavor of revolution. Mattias Iser argues that states that bring about\nwidespread human rights violations thereby fail to recognize the equal\nbasic moral status of citizens, and that this failure of recognition\nis a distinctive kind of wrong that weighs in favor of forceful\nreplacement of prevailing regime (Iser 2017).\n\nThe preceding points concern proportionality in revolutionary war in\ngeneral. Under relatively Hobbesian conditions, there is a further\ncomplication concerning proportionality. In such conditions, aspiring\nrevolutionary leaders face a serious collective action problem that\nestablished states have already solved: they must mobilize a\nsufficient portion of the population to make war effectively, in spite\nof the fact that it will often be rational for any given individual to\nrefrain from participating. As we shall discuss in the context of\njus in bello criteria of just war, revolutionaries will often\nneed to resort to coercing other members of the population in order to\nmotivate cooperation in revolutionary activity. The regime is likely\nto respond in kind to such coercive tactics, producing an escalating\nspiral of violence.\n\nThe discussion so far helps explain a general feature of revolutions,\nnamely, that they are often more violent than interstate wars,\nespecially when undertaken in Hobbesian conditions. Revolutionary wars\npresent a greater risk of literal anarchy, with all of the threats to\nhuman rights and well-being that this usually entails, because\nrevolutionaries, even when they succeed in defeating the regime, may\nnot yet have (and in some cases may never develop) the capacity to\nimpose order. In that sense, the stakes are often higher in\nrevolutionary wars and the traditional likelihood of success\nrequirement of just war theory may be harder to satisfy. Revolutionary\nconflicts, like other intrastate wars, are often especially brutal,\nbecause the lines between combatants and noncombatants tend to be\nblurred, because of the spiral of coercion stemming from strategic\ninteraction regarding revolutionary mobilization mentioned above, and\nbecause individuals and groups often use the general context of\nviolence to settle private conflicts that have little or no connection\nto the issues for which revolution is supposedly undertaken (Kalyvas\n2006: 14).\n\nSimilar complications to those encountered in the case of just cause\nalso arise regarding satisfaction of the rightful authority\nrequirement, especially under Hobbesian revolutionary contexts. It is\ntypically held that in order for some agent to have the rightful\nauthority to wage just war, she must in some significant way represent\nthe persons whose interests the war is meant to protect or promote\n(Finlay 2015 ch. 6; Parry 2018). If \u201crepresents\u201d means\nwhat it does in the context of ordinary democratic politics, namely, A\nrepresents B if and only if A is authorized to act on B\u2019s behalf\nthrough some appropriate public political process (such as an\nelection), then this is a non-starter, since an oppressive regime is\nunlikely to allow any such process.\n\nThis standard, institutionally-based understanding of representation\nwould work as a criterion of rightful authority to initiate\nrevolutionary war only if one of two conditions were satisfied. First,\nthose who initiate revolutionary war were duly chosen as\nrepresentatives prior to the advent of an oppressive regime (as when\nan authoritarian coup usurps an elected government). Second, the\nconstitutional order included pre-authorization for revolution under\ncertain specified conditions. It is worth noting that the French\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen explicitly included a\nright (and indeed a duty) to resist tyranny and that the Inner Service\nAct of the Turkish Armed Forces (articles 35 and 85) goes farther,\ndesignating an agent of revolution by pre-authorizing the military to\ndepose the government if it violates the constitutional requirement of\nsecular government. Just as an advance directive for medical care\nenables a competent patient to pre-authorize agent to act on her\nbehalf in the event of her losing the capacity to act, so a\nconstitutional provision of this sort would enable a people under\nconditions of political freedom to pre-authorize some agent to\ninitiate revolution on its behalf should the abuse of government\nauthority undermine its ability to perform an act of authorization.\nWhereas under Lockean conditions there may be some residual\ninstitutional structures that can be relied on to choose genuinely\nrepresentative revolutionary leaders, when facing a Resolute Severe\nTyranny or occupying Hobbesian contexts it is far less likely that\neither conditions of representation can obtain. A Resolute Severe\nTyranny is not likely to allow any institutional process for\nrepresentation by those who may oppose it.\n\nHere it is important to note that revolutionary conflict in such\nconditions typically begins when a relatively small minority\nundertakes armed struggle against the government and claims to do so\nin the name of the people. The problem is that it is difficult to see\nhow, in Hobbesian contexts, they could be authorized to act on behalf\nof the people.\n\nAnother problem concerning rightful authority in Hobbesian contexts is\nthat there are often two or more parties engaging in revolutionary\nviolence that contend with one another (often violently) to be\nacknowledged, by the people and by other states and international\norganizations, as the sole legitimate revolutionary war-maker.\nRevolutions frequently are characterized by violent struggles for\nleadership, under conditions in which no contender for leadership can\nclaim exclusive legitimacy if any legitimacy at all. So, in addition\nto the fact that Hobbesian conditions are characterized by a lack of\nsocial or institutional resources for the determination of rightful\nauthority, there is the fact that rival revolutionary groups may\nresort to violence among themselves in a bid to claim such\nauthority.\n\nIn the absence of any institutional provisions for choosing\nrepresentatives during the struggle or for pre-authorizing some group\nto serve as representatives prior to it, one might offer a different\nunderstanding of representation that is easier to satisfy in contexts\nwhere political revolutions have some appeal. An agent represents the\npeople, in a fashion that morally empowers her to initiate and lead\nrevolutionary war, if she is committed to and acts appropriately to\nrealize their shared interest or common good (Biggar 2013). It is\nworth noting just how distant this view is from any widely accepted\nnotion of rightful authority to make war in other contexts or for that\nmatter of rightful authority in any context, whether private or\npublic. The fact that Jones is committed to Smith\u2019s good and\nable to promote it effectively does nothing whatsoever to establish\nthat Jones has rightful authority over Jones, much less that he has\nrightful authority to undertake actions supposedly on Jones\u2019s\nbehalf that pose a danger to Jones or others. This understanding of\nrightful authority is subject to all of the objections to paternalism\ntoward competent adults.\n\nAt this point one might make a radical move: simply deny the rightful\nauthority requirement applies to revolutionary wars or at least to\nrevolutionary wars that occur in a Hobbesian context. This move could\nbe qualified with the proviso that although a group attempting to\nexercise leadership in the revolutionary struggle lacks rightful\nauthority, it is justified in assuming the leadership role only if it\nacts in such a way as to bring about conditions in which rightful\nauthority can exist. Similarly, one might argue that rightful\nauthority is not required in the case of a group that can help create\nthe conditions for legitimacy out of a situation of violently anarchic\nstate-breakdown, so long as that group acts in ways that facilitate\nthe establishment of legitimacy. This response to the problem of\nrightful authority calls into question the assumption that a just\nrecourse to war developed for application to interstate wars also\napplies in toto to revolutionary wars. Similarly, as we shall\nsee in the next section, there is also the question of whether\ntraditional jus in bello requirements apply without exception\nto the conduct of revolutionary wars.\n\nLet us turn to the last criterion of jus ad bellum,\nnecessity. The standard of necessity is satisfied when there is no\nless harmful means of achieving the cause for violence. For a\nrevolution to be necessary, it must be the case that existing\ninstitutions are both so deeply morally flawed and recalcitrant to\nreform that nothing short of displacing them and starting anew would\nsuffice to improve upon the existing state of affairs. This is why\ndiscussions about revolution generally take for granted that the\ntarget of revolution is something like a Resolute Severe\nTyranny\u2014only such regimes pose such a significant enough threat\nto the basic rights of persons while barring all prospects for\nreforming political institutions. Plausible candidates for revolution,\nthen, are states that are so organized as to foreclose internal\nchannels for reform. These channels need not be exclusively legal or\nconstitutional. Even states that bar significant portions of the\npopulation from access to legal or political mechanisms for change\nmight not make revolution necessary. Citizens of such states may still\nhave access to options like protest, general strikes, civil\ndisobedience, and uncivil disobedience as a means of forcing the\nrelevant kind of changes, thus making revolution unnecessary. Hence,\nour discussion has followed most discussions of political revolution\nby focusing on the case of extremely repressive regimes like Resolute\nSevere Tyranny, because only under such conditions of complete and\nunrelenting oppression is it plausible that revolution is necessary to\nbring about change.\n4. Revolutionary Jus in Bello\n\nPrinciples of jus in bello specify what kinds of particular\nactions are permissible in making war. Two standards feature\nprominently in discussions of jus in bello. First is\nproportionality, which holds that the specific acts or tactics\nemployed in war must promote the good to such a degree that it\noutweighs the \u201cbads\u201d or harms or rights-infringements of\nthe act or tactic. Second is discrimination, which is typically\nunderstood in terms of non-combatant immunity\u2014innocents are not\nliable to harms and so it is impermissible to target them. A much\ndisputed question is whether all and only civilians qualify as\ninnocents. Here it is worth noting that the original meaning of\n\u201cinnocent\u201d is one who is incapable of inflicting harm.\nSome military personnel, namely those who lack access to weapons or\nhave become incapable of using them may fit this description and some\ncivilians, namely those who supply resources to the military, may\nnot.\n\nA key issue that a theory of the morality of revolutionary war ought\nto address is whether these widely accepted jus in bello\nnorms apply without exception or modification to war-making by\nrevolutionaries or whether, instead, revolutionaries are morally\npermitted to undertake acts of war that the military personnel of\nstates are usually prohibited from performing. This is not a merely\ntheoretical issue: revolutionary warriors have often engaged in\nvarious morally problematic forms of \u201cirregular\u201d warfare.\nThey have assassinated civilian leaders and other civilians such as\ngovernment bureaucrats and judges, attacked regime forces while\nwearing civilian attire (not wearing uniforms or insignia as required\nby the laws of war and not carrying weapons openly), and engaged in\nterrorism, deliberately killing individuals who had no discernible\nconnection with the regime by detonating bombs in public places.\nFurthermore, in order to mobilize people to join the revolution or to\ndeter them from aiding the regime in suppressing it, they have engaged\nin acts of terrorism against the oppressed.\n\nThese examples of irregular tactics fall into four different\ncategories (Finlay 2015, pp. 206\u20138). First is civilian\ncamouflage, which involves combatants retaining the appearance of\ncivilians for the sole purpose of avoiding elimination prior to\ncombat. Second is civilian disguise, which, like civilian\ncamouflage, involves combatants appearing as civilians, but, unlike\ncamouflage, this misleading appearance is used to mislead the enemy\nduring combat. In an example of civilian disguise discussed by Michael\nWalzer, French partisans resisted German occupation by dressing as\npeasants and launching an ambush (Walzer 1977 p. 183). Third is\nhuman shields, a tactic where combatants deliberately locate\nmilitary targets near civilians in order to deter attack (Schmitt\n2009). Fourth, combatants can engage in non-combatant\ntargeting, a tactic that deliberately places non-combatants, e.g.\ncivilians, in harm\u2019s way for the sake of some advantage.\nExamples of non-combatant targeting include: the concealment of\ncivilians in a position close to military targets in the hopes that\nthe enemy harms them with collateral damage, provocation of the regime\nwith the intent of producing harms to civilians, or, of course,\ndeliberate targeting of locations predominantly used or occupied by\ncivilians. The aims of non-combatant targeting can range from\nmotivating the populace to join the revolutionary effort, to coercing\nthe populace into supporting the revolution, to instigating terror and\ndisorder. These irregular tactics are clearly in tension if not\noutright contradiction with jus in bello standards of\nproportionality and discrimination as they expose civilians to greater\nrisks of suffering collateral harm either by making it more difficult\nfor the enemy to discriminate between combatants and non-combatants,\nor by directly exposing non-combatants to greater harms on account of\nusing them as shields or deliberate targeting.\n\nRevolutionaries are often under powerful incentives to employ such\nirregular tactics, because they are disadvantaged relative to their\nadversaries. First, they will generally have less military training\nand less disciplined organization than regime combatants, they will be\nfewer in number, will generally have lower quality arms, and will have\ninferior logistical and intelligence capacities. Secondly,\nrevolutionaries face the challenge of mobilizing a people that has\nsuffered oppression under an unjust regime. Entrenched tyrannical\nregimes typically use their control over education and the media to\ninstill propaganda designed to prevent the people from recognizing\njust how rotten the regime is, how poorly the economy is performing,\nhow inferior the quality of life is compared with that in better\ngoverned countries, and how widespread dissatisfaction with the regime\nactually is. Hence, effective revolutionary action may require the\ndissipation of false consciousness on the part of the people. The\naspiring revolutionary leadership thus may be faced with the task of\ntrying to dismantle the false consciousness of those they hope to\nenlist in the revolutionary struggle. In actual cases, aspiring\nleaders have often used violence and sometimes terrorism in an effort\nto overcome the epistemic obstacles to widespread participation in\nrevolution. For example, they have attacked \u201csoft\ntargets\u201d\u2014policemen or government officials\u2014to\ndemonstrate to the people that \u201cwe have the power to\nhurt them\u201d. Another tactic often used by\nrevolutionaries to overcome epistemic obstacles is to provoke the\nregime to undertake brutal responses to relatively peaceful\ndemonstrations, in order to reveal to all just how ruthless the regime\nis. Such actions, which are condemned by mainstream jus in\nbello thinking, are said to be necessary to instill the sense of\nagency that false consciousness has undermined.\n\nWhile such \u201cirregular\u201d tactics are understandably\nattractive to revolutionaries, the claim that they are justified is\ngenerally regarded with a good deal of skepticism. We start by\nexamining the use of civilian camouflage and civilian disguise. These\ntactics are clearly at odds with standard requirements of\ndiscrimination, according to which combatants must wear uniforms and\nopenly carry their arms so that the enemy can distinguish them from\nnon-combatants. The intuitive appeal of the standard account of\ndiscrimination thus leads some thinkers to argue that civilian\ncamouflage and civilian disguise are impermissible because such\ntactics expose non-combatants to unjust and disproportionate risk of\ncollateral harm (Meisels 2008; Chiu 2010).\n\nThose who argue that civilian camouflage or disguise are permissible\ntypically appeal to fairness. The idea is that, at least in the early\nstages of their struggle, revolutionaries are at a great disadvantage\nvis \u00e0 vis government forces, that this disadvantage is\nsomething for which they are not responsible, and that the\nrevolutionaries should not be expected to let it render unsuccessful\ntheir struggle against a seriously unjust regime (Gross 2010:\n153\u20134). As noted earlier, revolutionaries typically have\ninferior arms and logistical capacities, they have no safe rear areas\nbehind which they can regroup and resupply because there are no battle\nlines as in conventional wars. Finlay argues that for these reasons,\ncivilian camouflage, but not disguise, is a tactic that\nrevolutionaries may permissibly employ (Finlay 2015, pp.\n211\u201312). Civilian camouflage is justified, according to Finlay,\nbecause this tactic serves only to enable revolutionaries to withdraw\ntemporarily from fighting and enabling this both restores fairness to\nthe distribution of rights and duties concerning warfare in asymmetric\ncontexts and is not inconsistent with standard laws of war. The use of\ncivilian disguise, on the other hand, is not permissible, because that\ntactic is not meant to restore fairness with respect to an ability\nnormally protected by the laws of war (i.e. the ability to withdraw\nfrom combat), but rather to diminish the ability of regular combatants\nto defend themselves (Ibid., p. 213).\n\nWhereas civilian camouflage and civilian disguise are tactics that\nonly indirectly contribute to the risk of collateral harm for\ncivilians by making discrimination between combatants and\nnon-combatants more difficult, tactics like the use of human shields\nor non-combatant targeting directly expose non-combatants to\nsignificant risks of harm for the sake of some military advantage and\nso necessarily violate the principle of non-combatant immunity. Many\ntheorists who study irregular conflicts like revolutionary war\ngenerally view such tactics as strictly impermissible.\n\nIt is important to note that critics of such irregular tactics do not\ngenerally claim that as a matter of principle irregular tactics can\nnever be justified. In the face of a \u201csupreme emergency,\u201d\nwhere failure to displace the prevailing regime would be a moral\ncatastrophe, such theorists often grant that irregular tactics that\nwould facilitate resolving the emergency may in fact be justified as a\nlesser evil. The problem lies in allowing persons waging war to judge\nfor themselves whether they occupy an exceptional, supreme emergency\nsituation. The worry is that if participants in war know that such\nexceptions are in principle available to them, then there is a serious\nrisk that their fallible judgments (perhaps shaped by various biases\nor motivated reasoning) lead them to make a wrongful exception and\nemploy tactics that are not in fact justified and which come at a\ndisproportionate harm to innocents and bystanders (Nathanson 2010, pp.\n201\u20138; Nagel 1972; Coady 2002; Coady 2004). Relatedly, one might\nworry that once one belligerent has violated the principle of\nnon-combatant immunity, opposing sides might respond by no longer\ncomplying with the norm in turn, leading to total breakdown of the\nrules of war (Waldron 2010: pp. 88\u201390).\n\nWhether the tactics in question are at risk of being abused will\nnaturally depend on the specific way in which they are employed, so it\nwill be helpful to distinguish the different kinds of non-combatant\ntargeting. First, and most extreme, is terrorism, by which we mean\ndeliberate targeting of non-combatants (for a more detailed and\nextensive discussion of terrorism, see the entry on\n terrorism).\n An example is the targeting of public places where combat is not\noccurring. The aims of such acts can include those of instilling\nterror in the populace, weakening support for the regime, or sending a\nmessage to the regime or international actors.\n\nRevolutionaries can employ tactics that target non-combatants which\nneed not be indiscriminate. Rather, they can employ a second sort of\nirregular tactic which we will call expansive discriminate\ntargeting. This tactic involves the deliberate targeting of\nnon-combatants who are taken to be morally liable to suffer harms from\nrevolutionary war. We will discuss the grounds of such liability\nshortly when we survey arguments given in defensive of irregular\ntargeting.\n\nThird, revolutionaries can rely on provocation of the enemy. The aim\nof this tactic is to provoke agents of the regime to harm\nnon-combatants with the aim of securing greater popular support for\nthe revolutionary movement. Provocation is distinct from the use of\nhuman shields in that the former is offensive whereas the latter is\ndefensive. Combatants employ human shields in the hope that the\npresence of non-combatants dissuades the enemy from launching an\nattack, whereas the intent of provoking the enemy is to have them harm\ninnocents. Fourth and last, combatants can employ coercion against\nnon-combatants with the aim of forcing them to join the revolutionary\neffort.\n\nThe argument from risk of abuse and the risk of breakdown of the rules\nof war applies to some, but not all, of these irregular tactics. These\narguments against irregular tactics are weaker when there are\nnaturally occurring incentives in place that would motivate against\nabusing the irregular tactics or against reciprocating their use and\nwhen the dominant regime does not already engage in the abuse of the\nrelevant sort of tactic. Such a situation is likely to obtain with\nregard to relatively less extreme forms of non-combatant targeting,\nnamely, expansive discriminate targeting and coercing support. In all\nlikelihood, a regime that can be the target of legitimate\nrevolutionary war is likely already employing some kind of coercion to\nbolster its ranks, which makes worries about further abuse of the\ntactic moot. Expansive discriminate targeting is also unlikely to be\nworthwhile for a dominant regime to employ because of its asymmetric\npower vis a vis the revolutionaries.\n\nRevolutionaries are unlikely to have access to established\ninstitutional structures that they can rely on to advance their war\neffort. The enemy of the regime consists of the specific members of\nthe revolutionary movement that threatens it, whereas the enemy of\nrevolutionaries is the regime as such, which is comprised not only of\npolitical officials and the combatants following orders issued by the\nofficials, but also the institutions and structures that keep the\nregime operating, and this makes an expansive understanding of\nlegitimate targets appealing for revolutionaries but not for the\nregime. By contrast, the arguments from risk of abuse and risk of\nbreakdown of the rules of war seem to hold in the case of terrorism\nand the use of human shields. Dominant regimes have some interest in\nemploying either of these tactics as the use of indiscriminate\ntargeting would counteract the likely use of civilian camouflage and\ndisguise that revolutionaries will by necessity employ, and the use of\nhuman shields would presumably be a deterrent against revolutionary\nattack (though, for a qualified defense of the use of human shields,\nsee Fabre 2012, pp. 256\u201367).\n\nEven if the arguments from risk of abuse and risk of breakdown of the\nrules of war do not hold in the case of coercing support and\nemployment of an expansive understanding of legitimate targets, this\ndoes not mean that revolutionaries are justified in deploying such\nirregular tactics. The principle of non-combatant immunity still seems\nto offer a compelling prima facie reason for holding such tactics to\nbe impermissible, and so some positive reason in support of their use\nmust be offered.\n\nIn defense of coercing support, Buchanan 2013 argues that some forms\nof coercion may be permissible, as when revolutionary fighters are\nconscripted through the threat of penalties such as expropriation of\nproperty or even perhaps confinement or lesser restrictions on\nliberty. The most plausible justification for such methods of coerced\nmobilization would characterize the goals of the revolution as public\ngoods of extraordinary moral importance and present coercion as a\nsolution to the collective action problem. For such coercion to be\njustified, it must be the case that the cause of revolution is just,\nthat the good gained by exercising coercion is proportionate to the\nbad of such coercion (i.e., one cannot use coercion to force persons\nto join a futile cause), the recruitment of further persons that can\nonly be achieved by coercion must be necessary for success, and the\nexercise of coercion must satisfy further standard principles\nconcerning the use of coercion to secure a morally significant public\ngood, namely the costs of coercion and contributing to the revolution\nmust be distributed fairly.\n\nWhat if anything can justify the deliberate targeting of\nnon-combatants by revolutionary forces? According to Fabre, \u201cthe\nact of killing an innocent person\u2014which infringes his right not\nto be killed and thereby extinguishes all his other\nrights\u2014cannot be justified unless as a way to avert the greater\nevil of far greater numbers of individuals suffering a similar loss,\nor a violation, of all rights. By implication, violations of the right\nto collective self-determination alone do not justify deliberately\ntargeting innocent non-combatants\u201d (Fabre 2012, p. 253).\n\nNotice that Fabre\u2019s conclusion takes for granted that\nnon-combatants are also innocent. In defense of a more expansive\nground for the deliberate targeting of non-combatants, Finlay argues\nthat some non-combatants are not innocent and that because of this\nfact it can be fair to distribute some of the harms of war to them.\nKey to Finlay\u2019s argument is the claim that there will be some,\nperhaps many, civilians whose conduct contributes to maintaining the\noppressive regime such that they are to some extent responsible for,\nor at least complicit in allowing, the harms of oppression to obtain.\nOn Finlay\u2019s view, then, supposing that targeting non-combatants\nis necessary for advancing a just revolutionary war and that doing so\nis the most proportionate means available, then targeting\nnon-combatants can be justified when the targets are to some extent\ncomplicit or responsible for oppression, which thereby grounds some\ndegree of liability to harm (Finlay 2015, pp. 261\u201383).\nComplications face this kind of argument as what counts as significant\ncontribution is both unclear and disputed. For example, a farmer who\nsupplies food for a tyranny\u2019s secret police or repairs the\nvehicles that they use to hunt down dissidents clearly makes a\ncontribution to their depredations, but it is unclear whether that\nsort of contribution makes her liable to deliberate targeting in war\n(Fabre 2009, Frowe 2014).\n5. Intervention\n\nWhether intervention in revolution can be justified is a question of\ngreat significance for the morality of political revolution. We will\nuse the term \u201cintervention\u201d in a broad sense to refer to\ndeliberate military contributions made by foreign actors. Intervention\nis thus understood to include acts like contributing combatants or\nweapons, as well as acts like instituting a no-fly zone, or providing\nintelligence or logistical support or training in the use of weapons.\nGiven the asymmetrical nature of revolutionary war, military\nassistance from foreign actors may be crucial, perhaps even necessary,\nto the success of revolutionaries.\n\nThough intervention may be of urgent importance for the success of a\nrevolution, the justification of military intervention by foreign\nactors is subject to important moral limitations. Michael Walzer has\nfamously argued that the right of collective self-determination sets\nstringent constraints on what foreign actors may do. On Walzer\u2019s\nview, foreign actors can only initiate unrequested intervention when a\npeople faces a supreme humanitarian emergency, such as genocide\n(Walzer 1977; Walzer 1980). Walzer\u2019s argument results in an\nasymmetry between the justification of revolution and the\njustification of intervention; whereas the former can be justified in\nresponse to oppression that does not reach the threshold of supreme\nhumanitarian emergency, the latter cannot (for discussion of the\nasymmetry position, see Dobos 2011).\n\nBuchanan has argued that respect for self-determination entails quite\ndifferent conclusions (Buchanan 2013). Buchanan rejects two common\nprinciples offered as constraints on intervention based in respect for\nself-determination. The first is Mill\u2019s principle, which holds\nthat popular support for revolution is necessary for intervention to\nbe justified. The second is the consent principle, according to which\nthe beneficiaries of intervention must consent to the intervention for\nit to be justified. Buchanan rejects both these principles because a\npopulace that is oppressed by a Resolute Severe Tyranny faces\nconsiderable obstacles to expression of popular support for revolution\nand consent to intervention.\n\nWithout such constraints on intervention, Buchanan has offered two\ndistinctive kinds of grounds for intervention in revolutions. First,\nhe has argued on the basis of considerations of proportionality that\nforeign actors can justifiably intervene in revolutions that may not\nhave even been instigated rightfully when such intervention serves to\neither a) preempt wrongdoing and the escalation of violence and\ncoercion that tends to take place in revolutionary wars, or b)\nestablish the conditions under which the oppressed are able to\nmeaningfully convey their support for (or opposition to) revolution or\nconsent (or lack thereof) to intervention (Buchanan 2013). Second,\nBuchanan has argued that considerations of self-determination may in\nfact weigh in favor of the justification of intervention (Buchanan\n2016). He argues that respecting a peoples\u2019 right to\nself-determination requires taking measures to protect the conditions\nof the exercise of a group\u2019s self-determination and to promote\nthe conditions under which the group is capable of being\nself-determining. Consequently, on Buchanan\u2019s view respect for\nself-determination, considered by itself, entails a permission to\nintervene in revolutionary wars when doing so will protect or promote\nthe people\u2019s self-determination. This permission extends to\nconsiderations of future generations, such that foreign actors may\nalso intervene in the formation of post-revolutionary government if\nthe post-revolutionary regime was going to be such that the conditions\nof self-determination would not obtain for future persons. It is\nimportant to note that Buchanan\u2019s argument is directed only\nagainst the view that respect for self-determination rules out\nintervention. He does not hold that the fact that an intervention\nwould promote self-determination entails that intervention is\npermissible all things considered. There can be counter-vailing\nconsiderations.\n\nMassimo Renzo offers the following critical reply to Buchanan\u2019s\nargument (Renzo 2018). Renzo first argues that even if a person is\ntemporarily incapable of exercising a right, this does not mean that\nothers cannot violate the right. Accordingly, the fact that some group\nis unable to exercise its right to self-determination does not imply\nthat others may act as though the group had no right to\nself-determination at all. Constraints based in self-determination may\nstill obtain on the grounds of a) past exercises of\nself-determination, and b) available reasons concerning how the group\nwould exercise their right to self-determination if they were able to\ndo so (for a critical reply to Renzo, see Weltman 2019). Buchanan\nmight reply that he acknowledges that the right of self-determination\ncontinues to exist under conditions in which the right-holders are\nincapable of exercising it but the right is violated only when it\ncould be exercised, not by measures that enable its exercise. The idea\nwould be that under conditions in which a tyranny prevents the people\nfrom developing the capacity for self-determination, the right is,\nlatent or in reserve and that respecting self-determination can in\nsome circumstances mean doing what is necessary to make the exercise\nof the right possible.\n\nThe exchange reviewed so far takes for granted that self-determination\nis relevant to some extent in determining the justification of\nintervention. A number of authors, however, deny that\nself-determination is of any import at all. On such views, if jus\nad bellum principles are satisfied, then intervention is\njustified regardless of whether it is supported by beneficiaries\n(McMahan 2010; Altman and Wellman 2011: ch. 5; Teson 2017 ch. 3).\nBecause these arguments reject that respect for self-determination\nsets constraints on intervention, they consequently entail a rejection\nof Walzer\u2019s asymmetrical position, resulting in a symmetry\nbetween permissions to engage in revolutionary war and permissions for\nforeign actors to engage in military intervention.\n\nReplying to such views, Renzo has argued that self-determination is\nindeed a value that sets constraints on the justification of\nintervention (Renzo 2020). Key to Renzo\u2019s argument is the claim\nthat self-determination is an independent value. In support of this\nclaim, Renzo argues that appeal to self-determination is necessary to\nexplain the wrongness of a certain kind of colonialism. Renzo holds\nthat colonialism that does not involve the violation of the basic\nhuman rights of colonized is nevertheless wrong because it violates a\npeople\u2019s right to self-determination. Having established that\nself-determination is indeed an independent value, Renzo goes on to\nargue that respect for the value of self-determination sets a pro\ntanto constraint on the justification of intervention. This\npro tanto constraint requires taking into consideration how a\ncommunity would have exercised its right to self-determination if it\nwere able to do so, and how it has exercised its self-determination in\nthe past in order to determine whether the intervention would be\naccepted by the community. Renzo does not, however, conclude that on\nhis account there is an asymmetry between revolution and intervention.\nRather, he argues that there is a symmetry, because revolutions will\ntend to be instigated by a vanguard group that in effect bears the\nsame relationship to the people as does a foreign actor. Accordingly,\nhe argues that there is symmetry between the justification of\nintervention and the justification of revolution because both must\ntake into consideration the right to self-determination of the\npeople.\n\nAn alternative account of the relationship between revolution and\nintervention is offered by Christopher J. Finlay (Finlay 2020). Finlay\nargues that revolution and intervention are complementary. He holds\nthat intervention is a supplement for revolution, such that the\njustification of intervention is a function of the justification of\nrevolution. In order for intervention to be justified on\nFinlay\u2019s view, it must be that, first, the beneficiaries of\nintervention are unable to secure their own rights, and second, that\ndomestic leaders of a revolution would be unable to succeed on their\nown.\n6. Implications for Further Research in the Philosophy of Revolution\n\nBoth the ethics of revolution and the ethics of intervention in\nrevolution are heavily fact-dependent, because both are shaped by\nconsideration of the likely consequences of engaging in revolution.\nMore specifically, whether individuals or groups ought to or may\npermissibly attempt to overthrow the existing political order and\nreplace it with a new one depends, inter alia, on whether the\nprospects for significant improvement are good, relative to the likely\ncosts of trying to achieving it. And for third parties considering\nwhether to intervene either in support of or in opposition to a\nrevolution an estimate of the risks and benefits is also essential. We\nhave seen that, except in the case of Kant\u2019s Conceptual\nArgument, the division between philosophers who opt for a blanket\nprohibition on revolution (and by implication, on intervention in\nsupport of revolution) and those who hold that revolution is sometimes\njustified is best explained by the hypothesis that the opposing groups\nrely on different estimates of the risks of revolution. But we have\nalso seen that the risks vary depending upon the context in which a\nrevolution occurs. Consequently, a sound philosophical theory of\nrevolution will be particularistic, in this sense: it will acknowledge\nthat there is no correct answer to the question \u201cIs revolution\njustified,\u201d unless the context is specified and a defensible\naccount of the relationship between different contexts and different\nlikely outcomes of revolution is provided. Doing that requires an\nempirically grounded account of the relationship between particular\ncontexts and outcomes. So far, no moral theory of revolution satisfies\nthis requirement.\n\nWe conclude, accordingly, that a defensible theory of the morality of\nrevolution must rely on a descriptive-explanatory theory of how\nlarge-scale political change is likely to occur, a theory that is\ncontext-sensitive. Further, since the question is when, if ever,\nrevolutions are likely to produce a morally better political order,\nwhat is needed is nothing short of a descriptive-explanatory theory of\nmorally progressive large-scale political change.\n\nAnother way to put this fundamental point is that theorizing the\nmorality of revolution should be \u201cnaturalized,\u201d not in the\nsense that normative issues should be reduced to factual ones, but\nrather in the sense that theorists should recognize the relevance of\nthe facts about what actually happens in revolutions. Until they do\nso, perennial debates about whether revolution or reform is the best\npath to moral progress, debates of great importance for the\njustification of revolution, will remain unresolvable. That means that\nthe normative theorizing about revolution, if it is to be concrete\nenough to be action-guiding, requires not just the traditional skills\nof the philosopher, but also recourse to relevant social scientific\ntheories of how large-scale changes come about (a factual question),\nin combination with principled assessments of whether the likely\noutcomes of revolution in various contexts will be morally\nprogressive.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Altman, Andrew, and Christopher Heath Wellman, 2011, <em>A Liberal\nTheory of International Justice</em>, Oxford: Oxford University\nPress.", "St. Augustine, <em>City of God</em> (<em>De civitate Dei</em>),\nHenry Bettenson (trans.), John O\u2019Meara (introduction), London:\nPenguin, 1972.", "Aquinas, Thomas, <em>Summa theologiae</em> (Section IIaIIae 42: On\nSedition), in <em>Aquinas: Political Writings</em> (Cambridge Texts in\nthe History of Political Thought), R.W.
