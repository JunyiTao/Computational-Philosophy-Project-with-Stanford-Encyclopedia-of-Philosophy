    "main_text": "Perception and Sense-data\n5. Perception and Sense-data\n\n\nIt did not take Moore long to realise that the realist position he\nhad advanced in \u2018The Refutation of Idealism\u2019 was too\n\u2018na\u2022ve\u2019 to be tenable; he had to be able to\naccommodate \u2018false\u2019 appearances somehow. But the strategy\nMoore adopted to deal with this remained true to the basic thesis of\n\u2018The Refutation of Idealism\u2019 that one should account for\nthe appearances of things in terms of the properties of the primary\nobjects of experience, and not the qualities of experiences themselves.\nTo elaborate this position Moore introduced the term\n\u2018sense-datum\u2019 to describe these primary objects of\nexperience:\nBut now, what happened to each of us, when we saw that\nenvelope? I will begin by describing part of what happened to\nme. I saw a patch of a particular whitish colour, having a certain\nshape \u2026. These things: this patch of a whitish colour, and its\nsize and shape I did actually see. And I propose to call these things,\nthe colour and size and shape, sense-data \u2026 (Some\nMain Problems of Philosophy 30)\n\n\nMoore implies here that the colour, shape and size are distinct\nsense-data; but he soon revised his terminology so that these are\nregarded as properties of the visual sense-datum he \u2018actually\nsaw\u2019, or \u2018directly apprehended\u2019 as he normally\nsays.\n\n\nOnce the concept of a sense-datum has been introduced in this way,\nit is easy to see that false appearances can be handled by\ndistinguishing between the properties of sense-data we apprehend and\nthe properties of the physical objects which give rise to these\nsense-data. But what is the relationship between sense-data and\nphysical objects? Moore took it that there are three serious candidates\nto be considered: (i) an indirect realist position, according to which\nsense-data are non-physical but somehow produced by interactions\nbetween physical objects and our senses; (ii) the phenomenalist\nposition, according to which our conception of physical objects is\nmerely one which expresses observed and anticipated uniformities among\nthe sense-data we apprehend; (iii) a direct realist position, according\nto which sense-data are parts of physical objects \u2014 so that, for\nexample, visual sense-data are visible parts of the surfaces of\nphysical objects. The indirect realist position is that to which he was\ninitially drawn; but he could see that it leaves our beliefs about the\nphysical world exposed to skeptical doubt, since it implies that the\nobservations which constitute evidence for these beliefs concern only\nthe properties of non-physical sense-data, and there is no obvious way\nfor us to obtain further evidence to support a hypothesis about the\nproperties of the physical world and its relationship to our\nsense-data. This argument is reminiscent of Berkeley's critique of\nLocke, and Moore therefore considered carefully Berkeley's\nphenomenalist alternative. Moore's initial response to this position\nwas that the implied conception of the physical world was just too\n\u2018pickwickian\u2019 to be believable. This may be felt to be too\nintuitive, like Dr. Johnson's famous objection to Berkeley; but Moore\ncould also see that there were substantive objections to the\nphenomenalist position, such as the fact that our normal ways of\nidentifying and anticipating significant uniformities among our\nsense-data draw on our beliefs about our location in physical space and\nthe state of our physical sense-organs, neither of which are available\nto the consistent phenomenalist.\n\n\nSo far Moore's dialectic is familiar. What is unfamiliar is his\ndirect realist position, according to which sense-data are physical.\nThis position avoids the problems so far encountered, but in order to\naccommodate false appearances Moore has to allow that sense-data may\nlack the properties which we apprehend them as having. It may be felt\nthat in so far as sense-data are objects at all, this is inevitable;\nbut Moore now needs to provide an account of the apparent properties of\nsense-data and it is not clear how he can do this without going back on\nthe initial motivation for the sense-datum theory by construing these\napparent properties as properties of our experiences. But what in fact\nturns Moore against this direct realist position is the difficulty he\nthinks it leads to concerning the treatment of hallucinations. In such\ncases, Moore holds, any sense-data we apprehend are not parts of a\nphysical object; so direct realism cannot apply to them, and yet there\nis no reason to hold that they are intrinsically different from the\nsense-data which we apprehend in normal experience. This last point\nmight well be disputed, and at one point Moore himself considers the\npossibility of a distinction between \u2018subjective\u2019 and\n\u2018objective\u2019 sense-data; but once one has introduced\nsense-data in the first place as the primary objects of experience it\nis not going to be easy to make a distinction here without assuming\nmore about experience than Moore at any rate would have wanted to\nconcede.\n\n\nMoore wrote more extensively about perception than about any other\ntopic. In these writings he moves between the three alternatives set\nout here without coming to any firm conclusion. From the outside, it\nseems clear that what was leading him astray was the sense-datum\nhypothesis itself and his reflections on perception can be regarded as\nan extended reductio ad absurdum of this hypothesis. It was\nonly towards the end of his career that he encountered in Ducasse's\nadverbial theory a serious alternative to the sense-datum hypothesis.\nBut the adverbial theory provides no easy way of avoiding the\ndifficulties Moore confronted: Moore rightly objected to Ducasse that\nit is not at all clear how the structure of a sensory field can be\nconstrued in adverbial terms. Yet there were other alternatives: in\nparticular, from the start of the twentieth century the\nphenomenological movement had offered an account of perception based\nupon a recognition of its inherent intentionality which avoids some of\nthe pitfalls of the sense-datum theory. It is, I think, a pity that\nMoore did not engage with this position, but this detachment was all\ntoo characteristic of the relationship at the time between the\nanalytical and phenomenological traditions.\n",
