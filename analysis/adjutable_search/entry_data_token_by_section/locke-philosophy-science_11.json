    "main_text": "Locke and Newton || Epistemology and methodology\n4.2 Ontology\n\nLocke\u2019s discussions of space, body, mind, and God bear some\nstriking similarities to Newton\u2019s, raising questions about the\nextent of those similarities as well as points of influence. Newton\npresents his mature concept of space in the Principia, having\nformulated important aspects of it earlier in the manuscript De\ngravitatione. In both texts, space is distinct from body and is\nreal, infinite, three-dimensional, and homogeneous. Whereas body has\nseparable parts, Newton\u2019s eternal, infinite space is immobile\nand indivisible, having merely distinguishable parts. Although space\nis neither substance nor attribute, it would be a mistake to suppose\nthat it is nothing; as he emphasizes in De gravitatione\n(2004, p. 21, 22), by explaining space\u2019s properties he has shown\nthat it is something.\n\nUnlike Newton, Locke initially accepted a relationist view of space;\nin journal entries of 1676\u201378 and the Early Draft of the\nEssay, space is nothing more than a relation between bodies\nthat do not touch (see Gorham, 2020, p. 221). In the Essay,\nhowever, his discussion of space and its relation to body is strongly\nreminiscent of the Principia\u2019s absolutist conception.\nLocke confesses himself to be among those \u201cwho persuade\nthemselves \u2026 that they can think on Space, without anything in\nit, that resists, or is protruded by Body\u201d (E II.iii.5, p. 126).\nDeclaring that explicating extension in terms of partes extra\npartes would be tautological (E II.iii.15, p. 173) and declining\nto answer the question of whether space is substance or accident (E\nII.iii.17, p. 174), Locke describes our idea of \u201cpure\nSpace\u201d (E II.iii.5, p. 126) as an extension consisting of\n\u201cthe continuity of unsolid, inseparable, and immoveable\nParts\u201d (ibid.; see also E II.xiii.13, 14, which further\ndiscuss space\u2019s perpetual rest and the impossibility of\nseparating its parts, either actually or mentally). Lacking solidity,\nspace poses no resistance to a body\u2019s motion (E II.xiii.12, p.\n172). Again recalling Newton, who takes space to be a consequence of\nGod\u2019s existence (2004, p. 21), Locke invokes God when defending\nhis conception of space: \u201cThose who assert the impossibility of\nSpace existing without Matter, must not only make Body infinite, but\nmust also deny a power in God to annihilate any part of Matter\u201d\n(E II.xiii.21, p. 176).\n\nAnalyzing remarks such as the above, most commentators have concluded\nthat by the time of the published Essay, Locke had fully\nabandoned the relationist view (see Gibson, 1960; Di Biase, 2016;\nGorham and Slowik, 2014; Gorham, 2020). However, Locke tends to\ndescribe our ideas rather than things themselves, and the gap between\nthe two has led a few commentators to conclude that Locke retained his\nearlier relationism or, at least, some inclination toward it (e.g.,\nThomas, 2016; see also Rogers, 1978).\n\nLocke\u2019s concept of body also overlaps considerably with\nNewton\u2019s. In developing a concept of body, Locke notoriously\nfinds the related, general problem about a substratum or substance\n vexing,[28]\n whereas Newton dispenses with the problem more easily. In De\ngravitatione, Newton eliminates the unintelligible notion of\nprime matter by associating perceived properties with determined\nquantities of\n extension.[29]\n Both thinkers attack Descartes\u2019 identification of matter with\nextension, instead sympathizing strongly with the notion of atoms in a\nvoid. Further, Newton\u2019s list in Rule 3 of body\u2019s universal\nqualities includes not only extension, hardness, impenetrability, and\nmobility, but also the vis inertiae\u2014the inherent force\nor power of resisting (Principia, Definition 3), which some\ncommentators take Newton to identify with\n mass.[30]\n Locke\u2019s concept, however, emphasizes extension, mobility, and\nsolidity, without mentioning mass. Still, since Locke explicates\nsolidity in terms of impenetrability, which arises from resistance (E\nII.iv.1), there may be grounds for holding that his concept does after\nall include mass, a position defended by Woolhouse\n (2005).[31]\n At the least, Locke\u2019s discussion of action by impulse\npresupposes mass, as Stein has noted. Nevertheless, presupposing the\nconcept may not amount to including it in the concept of body, since\nas Stein points out, mass for Locke \u201ccannot be construed to\ncorrespond to a simple idea, but can only be understood as a power\n\u2018mediately perceivable\u2019\u201d (Stein 1990, p. 36).\n\nThe question about gravity\u2019s relation to body is also a\npersistent source of controversy for both\n thinkers.[32]\n One point of clarity and consensus is that neither Locke nor Newton\nconsiders the power of gravitational attraction to be essential to\nmatter. Newton consistently denies that it is essential (for instance\nin his explanatory remarks following Rule 3 of the Principia)\nand Locke refers to it only as power superadded or endowed by God.\nLocke\u2019s concept of superaddition is controversial, as noted\nearlier, but he does appear to embrace action at a distance in his\nletter to Stillingfleet. Newton\u2019s writings contain no such\ndramatic pronouncements. So, while a few commentators interpret Newton\nas accepting action at a distance, grounded either in a superadded\nproperty (Henry 1994) or in a relational quality of matter (Schliesser\n2011), his more favorable remarks are at best indirect. Most\ncommentators interpret him as at least having very grave misgivings\nabout distant action, so perhaps Locke was wise to credit his change\nof heart about gravity to \u201cMr. Newton\u2019s incomparable\nbook,\u201d rather than to Newton himself.\n\nWith respect to mind, Locke and Newton are both circumspect about its\nnature and yet may be considered substance dualists. Although Newton\nindicates in De gravitatione that he does not pretend to know\nthe substantial foundation of minds, he consistently presents minds as\nimmaterial, lacking certain characteristics of body, namely, hardness,\nimpenetrability and resistance. Similarly, while Locke explicitly\nallows the possibility of thinking matter in his Essay and\ndiscusses it at length with Stillingfleet, he emphasizes that in all\nprobability, the soul is immaterial (E IV.iii.6, pp. 540\u2013541).\nDoes Locke share Newton\u2019s view that even immaterial spirits are\nspatially extended, such that a mind can co-occupy place with a body?\nA Cartesian interpretation does not seem impossible given\nLocke\u2019s remarks about the possibility of thinking matter, which\ncontrast matter against an immaterial soul that is\n unextended.[33]\n Still, at several passages in the Essay, Locke seems to\nagree with Newton. At E II xxvii.2 (p. 329), he locates minds\nspatially: \u201cFinite spirits having had each its determinate time\nand place of beginning to exist, the relation to that time and place\nwill always determine to each of them its identity, as long as it\nexists\u201d.\n\nFinally, Locke seems to share Newton\u2019s belief in God\u2019s\nsubstantial ubiquity and its implications. As the above-quoted\npassage\u2019s discussion of finite spirits continues, he remarks\nmore generally on the possibility of co-presence: \u201cThese three\nsorts of substances, as we term them, do not exclude one another out\nof the same place\u201d (ibid.). His later remarks about the\n\u201cinfinite Space \u2026 possessed by God\u2019s infinite\nOmnipresence\u201d (E II.xvii.20, p. 222) are similar, but by framing\nthem in terms of third parties\u2019 ideas, Locke leaves more room\nthere for interpretive controversy.\n",
