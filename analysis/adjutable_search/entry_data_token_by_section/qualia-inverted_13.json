For which Opinion, I think,\nthere might be many Reasons offered: but that being besides my present\nBusiness, I shall not trouble my Reader with them; but only mind him,\nthat the contrary Supposition, if it could be proved, is of little use,\neither for the Improvement of our Knowledge, or Conveniency of Life;\nand so we need not trouble our selves to examine it. (1689/1975, II,\nxxxii, 15)\n\n\nIt is regrettable that Locke did not trouble his Reader, because it\nis not at all clear what reasons may be offered. Malebranche was of the contrary opinion: \nYet I believe that it never, or almost never, happens that people see black or white other than as we see them, though they may not seem equally black or white to them. But as for the intermediate colors, such as red, yellow, blue, and especially those compounded from these three, I do not think there are many people who have exactly the same sensation of them. \n (1674\u20135/1997, I, 13, VI)\n\n\nLet \\(p\\) be the claim that when others look at ripe tomatoes, their\nexperiences have \\(Q_{R}\\). Let \\(S\\) be a\nspectrum inversion scenario with the following simple feature: when\nothers look at ripe tomatoes, their experiences have\n\\(Q_{G}\\), not \\(Q_{R}\\).\n(So \\(p\\) and \\(S\\) are incompatible.) Consider the following\nskeptical argument:\n\nArgument C\n\nP1.\n\nOne\u2019s evidence about others\u2019 behavior and use of color words\ndoes not favor \\(p\\) over \\(S\\).\nP2.\n\nOne has no other evidence that favors \\(p\\) over \\(S\\).\nP3.\n\nIf one\u2019s evidence does not favor \\(p\\) over \\(S\\), one does not know \\(p\\).\nTherefore:\n\nC.\n\nOne does not know \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nAlthough philosophers have generally not been impressed by similar\narguments for skepticism about the external world, there is little\nconsensus on the status of arguments along the above lines. For\nexample, Block writes: \u201cI claim we simply do not know whether\nspectrum inversion obtains or not\u201d (1990, 57). Argument C is less\nthreatening than some other skeptical arguments because, even if sound,\ngeneralizations of it to skepticism about other kinds of mental states\nare implausible. For example, a parallel argument against one\u2019s\nknowledge of other\u2019s beliefs would have a dubious first premise.\n\n\nP1 will be denied by an orthodox representationalist. Setting a\ncontroversial skepticism about testimony aside, presumably one can know\non the basis of testimony that tomatoes look red to many people. (See\nShoemaker 1982, 334.) So, since orthodox representationalism equates\n\\(Q_{R}\\) with the property of being an\nexperience of something\u2019s looking red, one may know on the basis of\ntestimony that when others look at tomatoes, their experiences have\n\\(Q_{R}\\).\n\n\nSome philosophers think that the fact that others are biologically\nsimilar to oneself is an important piece of evidence for their mental\nsimilarity (see, e.g., Hill 1991, Ch. 9), and P2 might be denied on\nthese grounds (see, e.g., Papineau 2002, 132).
