Both of these conclusions, if true, would be\ndevastating to the theory of forms. For, first, in the middle\ndialogues, Plato takes for granted that humans can know at least some\nforms (see Meno 76a6\u20137 and Phaedo 74b2\u20133) and\nsketches a method (i.e., dialectic) that is designed to provide humans\nwith knowledge of the forms (Republic 534b3\u2013c5); and, second,\nas Socrates himself accepts, it would be \u201cshocking\u201d (134c4)\nand \u201castonishing\u201d (134d8) to be told that the gods cannot\nknow human affairs.\n\n\nCommentators differ over the proper way to reconstruct and evaluate the\ntwo arguments. With respect to the first argument, some scholars\n(such as Lewis (1979)) claim that the argument is invalid, some (such\nas Peterson (1981)) that there are two different valid ways of\nreconstructing it, others (such as Yi and Bae (1998), and Rickless\n(2007, 86\u201390)) that there is a single way to reconstruct the argument,\none on which it comes out valid. The second argument is usually\nthought to be largely homologous to the first.\n\n\nThe first argument begins with the assumption (call it P1) that nothing\nthat is itself by itself is in (or among) humans (Parmenides\n133c3\u20136). This assumption reflects a particular understanding of\nwhat Separation requires, a conception that is emphasized in the\ndialogues of the middle period (see Symposium 211a8\u2013b1 and\nTimaeus 52a1\u20133\u2014for discussion, see Rickless (2007,\n19\u201320)). Parmenides then adds, and provides instances of, two\nfurther premises, P2 and P3:\n\n\n\n(P2) If X is a form and X is what it is\nin relation to Y, then Y is a form.\n\n\n(P3) If X is in humans and X is what it\nis in relation to Y, then Y is in humans.\n\n\n\nFor many commentators, P2 states that forms are related to other\nforms, but not to sensible things, and P3 states that sensible things\nare related to other sensible things, but not to forms (see, e.g.,\nRyle (1939), Cherniss (1944, 282 ff.), Chen (1944), Runciman (1959),\nSchipper (1965, 15), Matthews (1972), Weingartner (1973,\n185\u2013187), Fujisawa (1974, 30 ff.), Shiner (1974, 24 and 31),\nMcCabe (1994, 90\u201394), Gill (1996, 45\u201348), Sayre (1996,\n88\u201391), and Allen (1997, 193\u2013203)). But there are good\nreasons for thinking that this interpretation is incorrect (see\nForrester (1974), Lewis (1979), Peterson (1981), Yi and Bae (1998),\nand Rickless (2007, 88)).  Plato\u2019s formulation of P2 and P3\npresupposes a distinction between two ways of being: relative being\nand absolute being.  Something has relative being if it is impossible\nto describe its nature without mentioning something else to which it\nis related.  Something has absolute being if it does not have relative\nbeing.  The point of P2 is that it is in relation to another form that\nany form with merely relative being is defined. The point of P3 is\nthat it is in relation to another sensible thing that any sensible\nthing with merely relative being is defined. This reading is confirmed\nby Parmenides\u2019 illustrations of P2 and P3. Mastery itself, he\nsays, is what it is in relation to slavery itself, but it is not the\ncase that mastery itself is what it is in relation to a human\nslave. Similarly, slavery itself is what it is in relation to mastery\nitself, but it is not the case that slavery itself is what it is in\nrelation to a human master. Moreover, a human master is what he is in\nrelation to a human slave, but it is not the case that a human master\nis what he is in relation to slavery itself.  Similarly, a human slave\nis what he is in relation to a human master, but it is not the case\nthat a human slave is what he is in relation to mastery\nitself. Parmenides then instantiates P3 using the example of\nknowledge:\n\n\n(P3K) If X is knowledge in humans and X is what it is in\nrelation to Y, then Y is in humans.\n\n\nAnd finally, Parmenides assumes that knowledge has merely relative\nbeing:\n\n\n(P4) Knowledge is what it is in relation\nto what it is knowledge of.\n\n\nThe reasoning to the first conclusion is straightforward. By P4,\nknowledge is what it is in relation to what it is knowledge of.\nConsequently, by P3K, if X is knowledge in humans, then the\nobject of X (i.e., what X is knowledge of) is in\nhumans. Now, according to Separation, every form is itself by\nitself. But, by P1, nothing that is itself by itself is in\nhumans. Consequently, whatever is in humans is not a form. So\nif X is knowledge in humans, then the object of X is\nnot a form. That is to say, no knowledge in humans (i.e., no knowledge\nthat humans have) has any form as its object.  Thus, from Separation,\nP1, P3K, and P4, it follows that humans do not know any forms.\n\n\nThe second argument begins with two assumptions: (i) that any knowledge\nthat is a form is more precise than any knowledge that is in humans,\nand (ii) that the gods have any knowledge that is more precise than any\nknowledge that is in humans. From these two assumptions, what\nfollows is:\n\n\n(P5) If X is a knowledge and X is a form,\nthen the gods have X.\n\n\nParmenides then reasons as follows. By P2, if X is a form and\nX is what it is in relation to Y, then Y is\na form. By P4, knowledge is what it is in relation to what it is\nknowledge of.  So P2 and P4 together entail P6:\n\n\n(P6) If X is a form and X is a knowledge\nof Y, then Y is a form.\n\n\nNow, by P1, anything that is itself by itself is not in humans, and,\nby Separation, every form is itself by itself. Hence P1 and\nSeparation entail that no form is in humans, i.e., that if Y is a form,\nthen Y is not in humans. This result, taken together with P6,\nentails P7:\n\n\n(P7) If X is a form and X is a knowledge\nof Y, then Y is not in humans.\n\n\nParmenides then infers the following conclusion from the conjunction\nof P5 and P7:\n\n\n(C) If X is a knowledge of Y\nand the gods have X, then Y is not in humans.\n\n\nIf this inference were valid, then Parmenides would have shown that\nthe object of any knowledge the gods have is not in humans, i.e., that\nthe gods do not know human affairs. However, C does not follow\nvalidly from the conjunction of P7 and P5. Rather C follows\nvalidly from the conjunction of P7 and P5* (for details, see Rickless\n(2007, 92)):\n\n\n(P5*) If X is a knowledge and the gods have X, then X\nis a form.\n\n\nThere are three main possibilities here: (i) Plato simply missed the\nfact that the second argument is invalid; (ii) Plato intended his\nreaders to recognize the argument as invalid; and (ii) Plato\nunintentionally misstated P5* as P5. (In any event, it is\ninteresting to note that, whereas P3 but not P2 functions as a premise\nin the first argument, P2 but not P3 functions as a premise in the\nsecond argument.)\n",
