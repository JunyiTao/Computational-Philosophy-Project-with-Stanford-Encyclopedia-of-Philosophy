    "main_text": "Good Will, Moral Worth and Duty\n2. Good Will, Moral Worth and Duty\n\nKant\u2019s analysis of commonsense ideas begins with the thought\nthat the only thing good without qualification is a \u201cgood\nwill\u201d. While the phrases \u201che\u2019s good hearted\u201d,\n\u201cshe\u2019s good natured\u201d and \u201cshe means\nwell\u201d are common, \u201cthe good will\u201d as Kant thinks of\nit is not the same as any of these ordinary notions. The idea of a\ngood will is closer to the idea of a \u201cgood person\u201d, or,\nmore archaically, a \u201cperson of good will\u201d. This use of the\nterm \u201cwill\u201d early on in analyzing ordinary moral thought\nprefigures later and more technical discussions concerning the nature\nof rational agency. Nevertheless, this idea of a good will is an\nimportant commonsense touchstone to which Kant returns throughout his\nworks. The basic idea, as Kant describes it in the Groundwork, is that\nwhat makes a good person good is his possession of a will that is in a\ncertain way \u201cdetermined\u201d by, or makes its decisions on the\nbasis of, whatever basic moral principles there may be. The idea of a\ngood will is supposed to be the idea of one who is committed only to\nmake decisions that she holds to be morally worthy and who takes moral\nconsiderations in themselves to be conclusive reasons for guiding her\nbehavior. This sort of disposition or character is something we all\nhighly value, Kant thought. He believes we value it without limitation\nor qualification. By this, we believe, he means primarily two\nthings.\n\nFirst, unlike anything else, there is no conceivable circumstance in\nwhich we regard our own moral goodness as worth forfeiting simply in\norder to obtain some desirable object. By contrast, the value of all\nother desirable qualities, such as courage or cleverness, can be\ndiminished, forgone, or sacrificed under certain circumstances:\nCourage may be laid aside if it requires injustice, and it is better\nnot to be witty if it requires cruelty. There is no implicit\nrestriction or qualification to the effect that a commitment to give\nmoral considerations decisive weight is worth honoring, but\nonly under such and such circumstances.\n\nSecond, possessing and maintaining a steadfast commitment to moral\nprinciples is the very condition under which anything else is worth\nhaving or pursuing. Intelligence and even pleasure are worth having\nonly on the condition that they do not require giving up one\u2019s\nfundamental moral convictions. The value of a good will thus cannot be\nthat it secures certain valuable ends, whether of our own or of\nothers, since their value is entirely conditional on our possessing\nand maintaining a good will. Indeed, since a good will is good under\nany condition, its goodness must not depend on any particular\nconditions obtaining. Thus, Kant points out that a good will must then\nalso be good in itself and not in virtue of its relationship\nto other things such as the agent\u2019s own happiness, overall\nwelfare or any other effects it may or may not produce A good will\nwould still \u201cshine like a jewel\u201d even if it were\n\u201ccompletely powerless to carry out its aims\u201d (G\n4:394).\n\nIn Kant\u2019s terms, a good will is a will whose decisions are\nwholly determined by moral demands or, as he often refers to this, by\nthe Moral Law. Human beings inevitably feel this Law as a constraint\non their natural desires, which is why such Laws, as applied to human\nbeings, are imperatives and duties. A human will in which the Moral\nLaw is decisive is motivated by the thought of duty. A\nholy or divine will, if it exists, though good,\nwould not be good because it is motivated by thoughts of duty because\nsuch a will does not have natural inclinations and so necessarily\nfulfills moral requirements without feeling constrained to do so. It\nis the presence of desires that could operate independently\nof moral demands that makes goodness in human beings a constraint, an\nessential element of the idea of \u201cduty.\u201d So in analyzing\nunqualified goodness as it occurs in imperfectly rational creatures\nsuch as ourselves, we are investigating the idea of being motivated by\nthe thought that we are constrained to act in certain ways that we\nmight not want to simply from the thought that we are morally\nrequired to do so.\n\nKant confirms this by comparing motivation by duty with other sorts of\nmotives, in particular, with motives of self-interest,\nself-preservation, sympathy and happiness. He argues that a dutiful\naction from any of these motives, however praiseworthy it may be, does\nnot express a good will. Assuming an action has moral worth only if it\nexpresses a good will, such actions have no genuine \u201cmoral\nworth.\u201d The conformity of one\u2019s action to duty in such\ncases is only related by accident to morality. For instance, if one is\nmotivated by happiness alone, then had conditions not conspired to\nalign one\u2019s duty with one\u2019s own happiness one would not\nhave done one\u2019s duty. By contrast, were one to supplant any of\nthese motivations with the motive of duty, the morality of the action\nwould then express one\u2019s determination to act dutifully out of\nrespect for the moral law itself. Only then would the action have\nmoral worth.\n\nKant\u2019s views in this regard have understandably been the subject\nof much controversy. Many object that we do not think better of\nactions done for the sake of duty than actions performed out of\nemotional concern or sympathy for others, especially those things we\ndo for friends and family. Worse, moral worth appears to require not\nonly that one\u2019s actions be motivated by duty, but also that no\nother motives, even love or friendship, cooperate. Yet Kant\u2019s\ndefenders have argued that his point is not that we do not admire or\npraise motivating concerns other than duty, only that from the point\nof view of someone deliberating about what to do, these concerns are\nnot decisive in the way that considerations of moral duty are. What is\ncrucial in actions that express a good will is that in conforming to\nduty a perfectly virtuous person always would, and so ideally we\nshould, recognize and be moved by the thought that our conformity is\nmorally obligatory. The motivational structure of the agent should be\narranged so that she always treats considerations of duty as\nsufficient reasons for conforming to those requirements. In other\nwords, we should have a firm commitment not to perform an action if it\nis morally forbidden and to perform an action if it is morally\nrequired. Having a good will, in this sense, is compatible with having\nfeelings and emotions of various kinds, and even with aiming to\ncultivate some of them in order to counteract desires and inclinations\nthat tempt us to immorality. Controversy persists, however, about\nwhether Kant\u2019s claims about the motive of duty go beyond this\nbasic point (Timmermann 2007; Herman 1993; Wood 1998; Baron 1995).\n\nSuppose for the sake of argument we agree with Kant. We now need to\nknow what distinguishes the principle that lays down our duties from\nthese other motivating principles, and so makes motivation by it the\nsource of unqualified value.\n",
