    "main_text": "Intellectual suicide\n2. Intellectual suicide\n\nQuine insists that the student\u2019s elimination argument is only a\nreductio ad absurdum of the supposition that the student\nknows that the announcement is true (rather than a\nreductio of the announcement itself). He accepts this\nepistemic reductio but rejects the metaphysical\nreductio. Given the student\u2019s ignorance of the\nannouncement, Quine concludes that a test on any day would be\nunforeseen. That is, Quine accepts that the student has no advance\nknowledge of the time of the test, but he rejects that there is no\ntruth in advance as to when the test will be given.\n\nCommon sense suggests that the students are informed by the\nannouncement. The teacher is assuming that the announcement will\nenlighten the students. She seems right to assume that the\nannouncement of this intention produces the same sort of knowledge as\nher other declarations of intentions (about which topics will be\nselected for lecture, the grading scale, and so on).\n\nThere are skeptical premises that could yield Quine\u2019s conclusion\nthat the students do not know the announcement is true. If no one can\nknow anything about the future, as alleged by David Hume\u2019s\nproblem of induction, then the student cannot know that the\nteacher\u2019s announcement is true. (See the entry on\n the problem of induction.)\n But denying all knowledge of the future in order to deny the\nstudent\u2019s knowledge of the teacher\u2019s announcement is\ndisproportionate and indiscriminate. Do not kill a fly with cannon \u2014\nunless it is killer fly and only a cannon will work!\n\nIn later writings, Quine evinces general reservations about the\nconcept of knowledge. One of his favorite objections is that\n\u2018know\u2019 is vague. If knowledge entails certainty, then too\nlittle will count as known. Quine infers that we must equate knowledge\nwith firmly held true belief. Asking just how firm that belief must be\nis akin to asking just how big something has to be to count as being\nbig. There is no answer to the question because \u2018big\u2019\nlacks the sort of boundary enjoyed by precise words.\n\nThere is no place in science for bigness, because of this lack of\nboundary; but there is a place for the relation of biggerness. Here we\nsee the familiar and widely applicable rectification of vagueness:\ndisclaim the vague positive and cleave to the precise comparative. But\nit is inapplicable to the verb \u2018know\u2019, even grammatically.\nVerbs have no comparative and superlative inflections \u2026 . I\nthink that for scientific or philosophical purposes the best we can do\nis give up the notion of knowledge as a bad job and make do rather\nwith its separate ingredients. We can still speak of a belief as true,\nand of one belief as firmer or more certain, to the believer\u2019s\nmind, than another (1987, 109).\n\n\nQuine is alluding to Rudolf Carnap\u2019s (1950) generalization that\nscientists replace qualitative terms (tall) with comparatives\n(taller than) and then replace the comparatives with\nquantitative terms (being n millimeters in height).\n\nIt is true that some borderline cases of a qualitative term are not\nborderline cases for the corresponding comparative. But the reverse\nholds as well. A tall man who stoops may stand less high than another\ntall man who is not as lengthy but better postured. Both men are\nclearly tall. It is unclear that \u2018The lengthier man is\ntaller\u2019. Qualitative terms can be applied when a vague quota is\nsatisfied without the need to sort out the details. Only comparative\nterms are bedeviled by tie-breaking issues.\n\nScience is about what is the case rather than what ought to be case.\nThis seems to imply that science does not tell us what we ought to\nbelieve. The traditional way to fill the normative gap is to delegate\nissues of justification to epistemologists. However, Quine is\nuncomfortable with delegating such authority to philosophers. He\nprefers the thesis that psychology is enough to handle the issues\ntraditionally addressed by epistemologists (or at least the issues\nstill worth addressing in an Age of Science). This \u201cnaturalistic\nepistemology\u201d seems to imply that \u2018know\u2019 and\n\u2018justified\u2019 are antiquated terms \u2013 as empty as\n\u2018phlogiston\u2019 or \u2018soul\u2019.\n\nThose willing to abandon the concept of knowledge can dissolve the\nsurprise test paradox. But to epistemologists who find promise in less\ndrastic responses this is like using a suicide bomb to kill a fly.\n\nOur suicide bomber may protest that the flies have been undercounted.\nEpistemic eliminativism dissolves all epistemic paradoxes.\nAccording to the eliminativist, epistemic paradoxes are symptoms of a\nproblem with the very concept of knowledge.\n\nNotice that the eliminativist is more radical than the skeptic. The\nskeptic thinks the concept of knowledge is coherent and definite in\nits requirements. We just fall short of being knowers. The skeptic\ntreats \u2018No man is a knower\u2019 like \u2018No man is an\nimmortal\u2019. There is nothing wrong with the concept of\nimmortality. Biology just winds up guaranteeing that every man falls\nshort of being immortal. Universal absence of knowledge would be\nshocking. But the potential to shock us should not lead us to kill the\nmessenger (the skeptic) or declare unintelligible the vocabulary\ncomprising the message (specifically, the word\n\u2018know\u2019).\n\nUnlike the messenger telling us \u2018No man is an immortal\u2019,\nthe skeptic has trouble telling us, \u2018There is no\nknowledge\u2019. According to Sextus Empiricus, assertion expresses\nbelief that one knows what is asserted (Outlines of\nPyrrhonism, I., 3, 226). He condemns the assertion\n\u2018There is no knowledge\u2019 (though not the proposition\nexpressed by the assertion) as dogmatic skepticism. Sextus\nprefers agnosticism about knowledge rather than skepticism (considered\nas \u201catheism\u201d about knowledge). Yet it is just as\ninconsistent to assert \u2018No one can know whether anything is\nknown\u2019. For that conveys the belief that one knows that no one\ncan know whether anything is known.\n\nThe eliminativist has even more severe difficulties in stating his\nposition than the skeptic. Some eliminativists dismiss the threat of\nself-defeat by drawing an analogy. Those who denied the existence of\nsouls were accused of undermining a necessary condition for asserting\nanything. However, the soul theorist\u2019s account of what is needed\ngives no reason to deny that a healthy brain suffices for mental\nstates.\n\nIf the eliminativist thinks that assertion only imposes the aim of\nexpressing a truth, then he can consistently assert that\n\u2018know\u2019 is a defective term. However, an epistemologist can\nrevive the charge of self-defeat by showing that assertion does indeed\nrequire the speaker to attribute knowledge to himself. This\nknowledge-based account of assertion has recently been supported by\nwork on our next paradox.\n",
