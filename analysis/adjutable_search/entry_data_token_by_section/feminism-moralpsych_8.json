    "main_text": "The Psychology of the Oppressor\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe topics in feminist moral psychology are motivated by the feminist\naim to end women\u2019s oppression. Although what unites all\nfeminists is that they share this aim, as we have seen, feminists\ndiffer in their views on how best to accomplish this aim.\nSpecifically, regarding topics in moral psychology, feminists differ\nin their views on the following: the role of emotion in moral theory;\nwhether women have deformed desires and to what extent deformed\ndesires interfere with women\u2019s autonomy; the degree to which\nmembers of the dominant group men are responsible for their\nparticipation in women\u2019s oppression; whether members of the\ndominant group are able to take the perspective of the non-privileged;\nwhether the socialization or background circumstances of members of\nthe subordinate group mitigates their responsibility or\nblameworthiness for immoral action unrelated to oppression; and\nwhether women are responsible for resisting their own oppression. We\nshould not conclude that these differences suggest that feminist\nphilosophical scholarship is so divisive as to not be useful. Rather,\nwe should conclude the opposite, that feminist insights have greatly\nenriched the field of moral psychology by bringing philosophers\u2019\nattention to issues that have been previously ignored or not\nsufficiently examined. The progress feminists have made, and continue\nto make, on these issues is essential to eliminating women\u2019s\noppression.\n",
