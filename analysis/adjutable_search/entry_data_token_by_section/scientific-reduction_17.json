If one\ndenies classical substance-dualism and advocates a version of\nreductionism rather than eliminativism for minds, persons and mental\nstate, then one seems to assert that objects or\nsubstances reduce to objects. If one rejects any\ndualistic parallelism of mental and physical events and advocates a\nversion of reductionism rather than eliminativism for events such as\nperceivings, willings or pain events, then one seems to assert that\nevents may reduce to events. If one denies\nproperty-dualism, and advocates a version of reductionism regarding\nproperties such as that of being a person or of being a pain, then one\nseems to be committed to the assumption that properties\nreduce to properties. These different candidate-relata share\none important feature: They are non-representational in nature\n(ignoring cases of objects that are used as vehicles for\nrepresentations); they are real world items, not representations about\nitems in the world. Especially in the philosophy of mind, these\ncandidate relata have received special attention.\n\nIn contrast, most classical explications of reduction developed in the\nphilosophy of science treat the reduction relation to be primarily\ninstantiated by representational entities, such as theories or models.\nBuilding on these two lines of thought, one can, following Van Gulick\n(2001), draw a distinction between representational and\nnon-representational relata of the reduction relation, and accordingly\nbetween representational and ontological reduction.\nIntuitively, the conditions on an appropriate model of ontological\nreduction require the identification of a specific sort of\nintrinsic similarity between non-representational objects,\nsuch as properties or events. In contrast, the conditions on an\nappropriate model of representational reduction require the\nidentification of a specific sort of intentional similarity;\nif one representation reduces to another, it does so because of a\nsimilarity in what, and maybe how, these\nrepresentations represent.\n\nIt is noteworthy that different candidate relata come with different\ncandidate relations: Whereas those who regard properties as the\nprimary relata of reductions might coherently suggest that identity is\nthe relevant link, those who assume that theories are the primary\nrelata of reduction should refrain from this move: No theory reduces\nto itself.\n\nA brief survey of the candidate-relata should thus pair them with the\ncandidate relations that best fit each in turn (Van Gulick 2001).\n",
