    "main_text": "Requirements of Structural Rationality || Wide- vs. Narrow-Scope Requirements\n2.1 Wide- vs. Narrow-Scope Requirements\n\nThe most widely debated \u2013 and arguably most important \u2013\nquestion about the form of structural requirements of rationality is\nwhether these requirements take wide scope (e.g. Broome 1999; Wallace\n2001; Bratman 2009b) or narrow scope (e.g. Korsgaard 1997; Schroeder\n2004; Kolodny 2005). To explain this distinction, recall that\nstructural irrationality involves (at least in the vast majority of\ncases) a tension between at least two attitude-states (where an\nattitude-state might consist in either the presence or the absence of\nan attitude). For example, akrasia involves a tension between a belief\nto the effect that one ought to \\(\\Phi\\) \\([\\rBO\\Phi]\\) and the lack\nof an intention to \\(\\Phi\\) \\([\\rI\\Phi].\\) On the received view,\nhaving this combination of attitude-states is irrational in virtue of\nviolating a requirement of structural rationality. And on a prima\nfacie natural interpretation of such requirements, these\nrequirements are conditional on one (or more) of the relevant\nattitude-states (the \u201cantecedent state(s)\u201d) and take scope\nover some other attitude-state (the \u201cconsequent state\u201d).\nThus, for example, a natural way to understand what Broome (2013) has\ndubbed the \u201cenkratic requirement\u201d \u2013 the requirement\nprohibiting akrasia \u2013 is as follows:\n\nEnkratic requirement, narrow-scope:\n\nIf \\(A\\) believes that she ought to \\(\\Phi\\), then rationality\nrequires \\(A\\) to intend to \\(\\Phi\\) \\([\\rBO\\Phi \\to\n\\rR(\\rI\\Phi)].\\)\n\nAs several authors have emphasized, however, structural requirements\ncan also be understood in a different way (Hill 1973; Greenspan 1975;\nDancy 1977; Darwall 1983; and, more recently, Broome 1999, 2007c,\n2013; Wallace 2001; Bratman 2009b; Brunero 2010, 2020; Way 2011).\nAccording to this alternative reading, structural requirements are not\nconditional on the antecedent state; instead, both the antecedent and\nthe consequent state are part of the scope of requirement, which is\nwhy this is called a \u2018wide scope\u2019 reading. In case of the\nenkratic requirement, this interpretation says:\n\nEnkratic requirement, wide-scope:\n\nRationality requires of \\(A\\) that [if \\(A\\) believes that she ought\nto \\(\\Phi\\), then \\(A\\) intends to \\(\\Phi\\)]\n\\([\\rR(\\rBO\\Phi\\to\\rI\\Phi)]\\).\n\nTo illustrate the relevance of this distinction and the ways in which\nthe two requirements have different consequences, consider Ava, an\nenvironmentalist activist who has gone astray and formed the belief\nthat she ought to extinguish all human life. The narrow-scope and\nwide-scope enkratic requirements will have different results for our\nverdicts about Ava along two dimensions: symmetry and\ndetachment.\n\nBeginning with symmetry: Ava can comply with the wide-scope enkratic\nrequirement in one of two ways: either by coming to intend to\nextinguish human life or by dropping her belief that she ought to\nextinguish human\n life.[5]\n Conversely, she can comply with the narrow-scope enkratic requirement\nonly by coming to intend to extinguish human life. In this sense, the\nwide-scope requirement is symmetric while the narrow-scope\nrequirement is asymmetric. Strikingly, this difference has\nbeen employed as part of arguments for both the wide-scope\nand narrow-scope views. Wide-scopers claim that symmetry is desirable\nbecause it would not be irrational in any good sense for Ava to drop\nher misguided belief instead of coming to intend to extinguish human\nlife (Broome 1999; Worsnip 2021). Narrow-scopers, by contrast, charge\nthat symmetry is undesirable because there is an important difference\nbetween forming an intention on the basis of a normative\nbelief and dropping a normative belief merely on the basis of\nan absence of an intention to follow through on it: the former process\nseems in some way more rational than the latter (Schroeder 2004, 2009;\nKolodny 2005; Bedke 2009; Finlay 2010). Whether this latter charge is\na compelling argument against the wide-scope view depends in large\npart on whether structural requirements such as the enkratic\nrequirement should reflect facts about which states it is rational to\nbase on which: Kolodny (2005) argues that they must, while\nmany wide-scopers (Way 2011; Brunero 2012; Broome 2013) hold that they\ndo not, maintaining that there are independent \u201cbasing\nprohibitions\u201d and \u201cbasing permissions\u201d that account\nfor the rationality of basing in particular.\n\nLet\u2019s now consider detachment. Consider the inference:\n\n(1a)\n\\(\\rBO\\Phi\\to \\rR(\\rI\\Phi)\\)\n(2)\n\\(\\rBO\\Phi\\)\nSo,\n\u00a0\n(3)\n\\(\\rR(\\rI\\Phi)\\)\n\n\nThis inference-pattern is valid via modus ponens. Applied to\nthe case of Ava, this means that we can derive (or\n\u201cdetach\u201d) a requirement for Ava to intend to extinguish\nhuman life (3) from the narrow-scope enkratic requirement (1a) and the\npremise that Ava believes that she ought to extinguish human life (2).\nThe wide-scope account avoids this implication, for the following\ninference is not validated by the propositional calculus:\n\n(1b)\n\\(\\rR(\\rBO\\Phi\\to\\rI\\Phi)\\)\n(2)\n\\(\\rBO\\Phi\\)\nSo,\n\u00a0\n(3)\n\\(\\rR(\\rI\\Phi)\\)\n\n\nHence, the conclusion that Ava is rationally required to intend to\nextinguish all human life (3) does not obviously follow from the\nwide-scope enkratic requirement (1b) and the premise that Ava believes\nthat she ought to extinguish all human life (2). In order for this\ninference to be valid, the deontic logic of rational requirements\nwould need to contain the following axiom:\n\nFactual detachment:\n\nIf \\(p\\), and rationality requires of \\(A\\) that \\(p\\to q,\\) then\nrationality requires of \\(A\\) that \\(q\\).\n\nBut this principle is questionable and widely rejected (see esp.\nBroome 1999).\n\nSome philosophers (e.g., Broome 1999; Bratman 2009b) take the fact\nthat narrow-scope requirements detach while wide-scope requirements do\nnot as a point in favor of the wide-scope requirement. Suppose that we\nhave derived the conclusion that Ava is rationally required to intend\nto extinguish all human life from the narrow-scope enkratic\nrequirement via modus ponens. If we add the further premise that\nrationality is normative (see \u00a73 below) in the sense that we\nought (or have reason) to comply with structural requirements, we are\nforced to conclude that Ava ought (or has reason) to intend\nto extinguish all human life \u2013 simply because she has adopted a\ncrazy belief. But this kind of \u201cbootstrapping\u201d is widely\nregarded as unacceptable (recall \u00a71.1). Thus, if rationality is\nnormative, this seems to tell against the narrow-scope view.\n\nIt is worth noting that the issues of symmetry, detachment, and\nbootstrapping arise with regard to the scope of all structural\nrequirements on attitude-combinations, including those that concern\nonly doxastic states. For one example, take the aforementioned\n(putative) requirement forbidding \u201cepistemic akrasia\u201d,\nwhich requires alignment between one\u2019s higher-order and\nfirst-order doxastic states. Suppose Darren believes that his evidence\nsupports believing that the earth is flat. Again, a narrow-scope\nversion of an anti-epistemic akrasia requirement seems to allow us to\ndetach the conclusion that (structural) rationality requires Darren to\nbelieve that the earth is flat. Wide-scopers will complain that this\nis incorrect, since structural rationality should at least permit\nDarren to instead drop his higher-order belief that the evidence\nsupports believing that the earth is flat (i.e., the requirement\nshould be symmetrical). Moreover, they will say, it is particularly\nobjectionable when paired with the thesis that rationality is\nnormative, since this would allow us to conclude that Darren can make\nit the case that he ought or has reason to believe the earth is flat\nmerely by (unjustifiably) believing that this is what his evidence\nsupports (i.e., would license problematic bootstrapping). On the other\nhand, narrow-scopers will charge that it is more rational to come to\nbelieve \\(p\\) on the basis of a belief that one\u2019s\nevidence supports \\(p\\) than to drop a belief that one\u2019s\nevidence support \\(p\\) on the basis of a mere absence of\nbelief in \\(p\\). Or consider the requirement to respect modus\nponens, and our aforementioned character Ali, who believes he is\nSuperman and that Superman can fly. Wide-scopers will hold that\nstructural rationality should at least permit Ali to drop his belief\nthat he is Superman rather than come to believe he can fly. In\naddition, they will stress that any view that yields the conclusion\nthat Ali can make it the case that he ought or has reason to believe\nhe can fly merely by holding the beliefs that he is Superman and that\nSuperman can fly must be rejected. By contrast, narrow-scopers will\nhold that it is more rational to come to believe \\(q\\) on the basis of\nbelief in \\(p\\) and belief that if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\) than it is to give\nup one\u2019s belief in \\(p\\) or one\u2019s belief that if \\(p\\)\nthen \\(q\\) on the basis of a mere absence of belief in \\(q\\)\n(as distinct from a positive belief that not-\\(q)\\). (For reasons of\nbrevity, we will focus on the practical enkratic requirement in the\nremainder of this section, but as with this subsection, the same\npoints apply to other structural requirements, including those that\nconcern only doxastic states.)\n\nThe wide-scope account has sometimes been charged with assuming a\nmistaken semantic view, namely that ordinary conditionals of\nthe form \u201cIf you \\(\\Phi\\), you ought to \\(\\Psi\\)\u201d are to\nbe read as really expressing the wide-scope requirement that you ought\nto be such that (if you \\(\\Phi\\), then you\n \\(\\Psi)\\).[6]\n Many philosophers of language reject this \u201cwide-scope\nsemantics\u201d (Hansson 1969, van Fraassen 1972, Lewis 1973, Kratzer\n1981; for applications to contemporary debates about rationality, see\nDreier 2009, Schroeder 2011, Dowell 2012, Silk 2014). In response,\nwide-scopers can make two points (Kiesewetter 2017: Ch. 3; Worsnip\n2021: Chs. 6\u20137). First, they can maintain that while the\nfundamental explanation of structural irrationality is provided by\nwide-scope requirements, the semantics of ordinary conditionals is a\ndifferent matter. For example, Worsnip (2021: Ch. 7) combines the\nwide-scope view of structural requirements with a more orthodox,\ncontextualist account of ordinary deontic conditionals along the lines\nof Kratzer (1981). Second, they can point out that the spirit of the\nwide-scope view can be maintained without stating structural\nrequirements as involving conditionals at all. The relevant\nrequirements can instead be understood as requiring disjunctive\nresponses or as prohibitions on combinations of responses. For\nexample, the wide-scope enkratic requirement can be formulated in\neither of the following two ways:\n\nEnkratic requirement, disjunctive:\n\nRationality requires \\(A\\) to [intend to \\(\\Phi\\) or not believe that\nshe ought to \\(\\Phi\\)].\n\nEnkratic requirement, combination prohibition:\n\nRationality requires \\(A\\) to not [believe that she ought to \\(\\Phi\\)\nand not intend to \\(\\Phi\\)].\n\nThese requirements are symmetric and do not allow for detachment; they\nthus share with the original wide-scope formulations the properties\nthat distinguish them from narrow-scope requirements.\n",
