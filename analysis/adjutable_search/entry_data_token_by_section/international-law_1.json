    "main_text": "International Law as Law\n2. International Law as Law\n\nThe two features of international law most commonly invoked by those\nwho call into question its legal character are the absence of a\ncentralized system of enforcement and the role of state consent in the\nformation of rules of international law. Some legal philosophers,\nwhile recognizing that international law possesses some features\ncharacteristic of law, dispute its status as a genuine and\nfully-fledged legal order (e.g., Hart 1961 [2012]). We consider these\ndifferent strands of arguments on the legal nature of international\nlaw in turn.\n",
