    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods for Children\n4. Personal Relationship Goods for Children\n\nSome personal relationship goods have been said to be especially\nimportant, and possibly owed only to, children. Alternatively, some of\nthem may be owed to children in a more robust way than they are owed\nto adults\u2014as outcomes to children and as mere opportunities to\nadults (Macleod 2010b; Lindblom 2018). Children can fully enjoy these\ngoods only if they are well cared for; and some of these\ngoods\u2014discussed below\u2014are themselves personal relationship\ngoods.\n\nDuring childhood, personal relationship goods are instrumental to the\ngood life of children in two ways: by allowing them to enjoy good\nhealth and pleasure during childhood and, due to their developmental\nrole, by contributing to their future adult flourishing, including\ntheir future ability to relate to others (Vaillant 2012). Because of\nthis double aspect, conflicts are in principle possible between\nallowing children to enjoy personal relationship goods in ways that\nmaximize childhood wellbeing versus allowing them to enjoy these goods\nin ways that optimize the wellbeing of the future adult (Hannan 2018).\nFor instance, it is possible that it is best for a child qua\nchild to enjoy as much time as possible in playful interaction with\nloving adults, while for the future adult it may be more\ninstrumentally valuable to use the time for honing competitive\nabilities. An interesting possibility, so far unexplored by normative\ntheorists, is that personal relationship goods are also of\ndevelopmental value for adults. Given that we are capable of some\ndegree of psychological development throughout our lives\u2014or, in\nneurobiological terms, some degree of brain plasticity\u2014it is\npossible that enjoying the goods of personal relationships can help\nfoster psychological development during adulthood. For the purpose of\nthis section, the assumption is that the goods discussed below are of\nparticularly high value to children thanks to their developmental\nrole, and that childhood is a period of life which is developmentally\nspecial, thus requiring that we pay special attention to developmental\ngoods.\n",
