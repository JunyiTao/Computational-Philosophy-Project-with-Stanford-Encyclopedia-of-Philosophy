    "main_text": "Lakatos\u2019s Big Ideas || Against Formalism in Mathematics\n2.1 Against Formalism in Mathematics\n\nThe first is his Philosophy of Mathematics, especially as set forth in\n\u201cProofs and Refutations\u201d (1963\u201364) a series of four\narticles, based on his PhD thesis, and written in the form of a\nmany-sided dialogue. These were subsequently combined in a posthumous\nbook and published, with additions, in 1976. The title is an allusion\nto a famous paper of Popper\u2019s, \u201cConjectures and\nRefutations\u201d (the signature essay of his best-known collection),\nin which Popper outlines his philosophy of science. Lakatos\u2019s\npoint is that the development of mathematics is much more like the\ndevelopment of science as portrayed by Popper than is commonly\nsupposed, and indeed much more like the development of science as\nportrayed by Popper than Popper himself supposed.\n\nWhat Lakatos does not make so much of (though he does not conceal it\neither) is that in his view the development of mathematics is also\nmuch more like the development of thought in general as\nanalysed by Hegel than Hegel himself supposed. There is\nthesis, antithesis and synthesis, \u201cHegelian language, which\n[Lakatos thinks would] generally be capable of describing the various\ndevelopments in mathematics\u201d (P&R: 146). Thus there is a\ncertain sense in which Lakatos out-Hegels Hegel, giving a dialectical\nanalysis of a discipline (mathematics) that Hegel himself despised as\ninsufficiently dialectical (see Larvor 1998, 1999, 2001). Hence\nFeyerabend\u2019s gibe (which Lakatos took in good part) that Lakatos\nwas a Pop-Hegelian, the bastard child of Popperian father and a\nHegelian mother (F&AM: 184\u2013185).\n\nProofs and Refutations is a critique of\n\u201cformalist\u201d philosophies of mathematics (including\nformalism proper, logicism and intuitionism), which, in\nLakatos\u2019s view, radically misrepresent the nature of mathematics\nas an intellectual enterprise. For Lakatos, the development of\nmathematics should not be construed as series of Euclidean deductions\nwhere the contents of the relevant concepts has been carefully\nspecified in advance so as to preclude equivocation. Rather, these\nwater-tight deductions from well-defined premises are the (perhaps\ntemporary) end-points of an evolutionary, and indeed a\ndialectical, process in which the constituent concepts are\ninitially ill-defined, open-ended or ambiguous but become sharper and\nmore precise in the context of a protracted debate. The proofs are\nrefined in conjunction with the concepts (hence \u201cproof-generated\nconcepts\u201d) whilst \u201crefutations\u201d in the form of\ncounterexamples play a prominent part in the process. [One might\nalmost say, paraphrasing Hegel, that in Lakatos\u2019s view\n\u201cwhen Euclidean demonstrations paint their grey in grey, then\nhas a shape of mathematical life grown old\u2026The owl of the\nformalist Minerva begins its flight only with the falling of\ndusk\u201d (Hegel 2008 [1820/21]: 16).]\n\nLakatos is also keen to display the development of mathematics as a\nrational affair even though the proofs (to begin with) are\noften lacking in logical rigour and the key concepts are often\nopen-ended and unclear\n\n\nThe idea\u2014expressed so clearly by Seidel [and clearly endorsed by\nLakatos himself]\u2014that a proof can be respectable without being\nflawless, was a revolutionary one in 1847, and, unfortunately, still\nsounds revolutionary today. (P&R: 139)\n\n\nA corollary of this is that in mathematics many of the\n\u201cproofs\u201d are not really proofs in the full sense of the\nword (that is, demonstrations that proceed deductively from apodictic\npremises via unquestionable rules of inference to certain conclusions)\nand that many of the \u201crefutations\u201d are not really\nrefutations either, since something rather like the\n\u201crefuted\u201d thesis often survives the refutation and arises\nrefreshed and invigorated from the dialectical process.\n\nThis becomes apparent early on in the dialogue, when the Popperian\nGamma protests at the Teacher\u2019s insouciance with respect to\nrefutation, a counterexample to Euler\u2019s thesis (and therefore to\nCauchy\u2019s proof) that, for all regular polyhedra, the number of\nvertices, minus the number of edges, plus the number of faces equals\ntwo. The counterexample is a solid bounded by a pair of nested cubes,\none of which is inside, but does not touch the other:\n\n\n\n\nFor this hollow cube, \\(V - E + F\\) (including both the inner and the\nouter ones) \\(= 4\\). According to Gamma, this simply refutes\nEuler\u2019s conjecture and disproves Cauchy\u2019s proof:\n\n\nGAMMA: Sir, your composure baffles me. A single counterexample refutes\na conjecture as effectively as ten. The conjecture and its proof have\ncompletely misfired. Hands up! You have to surrender. Scrap the false\nconjecture, forget about it and try a radically new approach.\n\nTEACHER: I agree with you that the conjecture has received a\nsevere criticism by Alpha\u2019s counterexample. But it is untrue\nthat the proof has \u201ccompletely misfired\u201d. If, for the time\nbeing, you agree to my earlier proposal to use the word\n\u201cproof\u201d for a \u201cthought-experiment which leads to\ndecomposition of the original conjecture into subconjectures\u201d,\ninstead of using it in the sense of a \u201c guarantee of certain\ntruth\u201d, you need not draw this conclusion. My proof certainly\nproved Euler\u2019s conjecture in the first sense, but not\nnecessarily in the second. You are interested only in proofs which\n\u201cprove\u201d what they have set out to prove. I am interested\nin proofs even if they do not accomplish their intended task. Columbus\ndid not reach India but he discovered something quite interesting.\n\n\nThus even in his earlier work, when he is still a professed disciple\nof Popper, Lakatos is already a rather dissident Popperian. Firstly,\nthere are the hat-tips to Hegel as well as to Popper that\ncrop up from time to time in Proofs and Refutations including\nthe passage where he praises (and condemns) them both in the same\nbreath. (\u201cHegel and Popper represent the only fallibilist\ntraditions in modem philosophy, but even they both made the mistake of\nreserving a privileged infallible status for mathematics\u201d.\nP&R: 139n.1.) Given that Hegel was anathema to Popper (witness his\nfamous or notorious anti-Hegel \u201cscherzo\u201d in The Open\nSociety and Its Enemies, (1945 [1966])) this strongly suggests\nthat Lakatos took his Popper with a large pinch of salt. Secondly, for\nPopper himself a proof is a proof and a refutation is supposed to kill\na scientific conjecture stone-dead. Thus non-demonstrative proofs and\nnon-refuting refutations mark a major departure from Popperian\northodoxy.\n",
