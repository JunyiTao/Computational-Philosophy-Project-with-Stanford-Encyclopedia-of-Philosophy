    "main_text": "Reflections on Knowledge\n7. Xenophanes\u2019 Legacy\n\nMany later writers identified Xenophanes as the teacher of Parmenides\nand the founder of the Eleatic \u201cschool of\nphilosophy\u201d\u2014the view that, despite appearances, what there\nis is a motionless, changeless, and eternal \u2018One\u2019. This\nview of Xenophanes is based largely on Plato\u2019s reference to\n\u201cour Eleatic tribe, beginning from Xenophanes as well as even\nearlier\u201d (Sophist 242d) and Aristotle\u2019s remark\nthat \u201c...with regard to the whole universe, he says that the one\nis the god\u201d (Meta. A5, 986b18), along with some verbal\nsimilarities between Xenophanes\u2019 description of the \u201cone\ngreatest, unmoving god\u201d and Parmenides\u2019 account of a\n\u201cmotionless, eternal, and unitary being\u201d. But the\nXenophanes who speaks to us in the surviving fragments is a\ncombination of rhapsode, social critic, religious teacher, and keen\nstudent of nature. Euripides\u2019 Heracles 1341 ff. echoes\nhis attack on the stories told about the gods by Homer and Hesiod\n(B11\u201312) and a passage of Euripides\u2019 Autolycus\nquoted by Athenaeus (C2) repeats portions of the attack on the honors\naccorded to athletes delivered in B2. In the Republic, Plato\nshows himself the spiritual heir of Xenophanes when he states that the\nguardians of his ideal state are more deserving of honors and public\nsupport than the victors at Olympia, criticizes the stories told about\nthe gods by the poets, and calls for a life of moderate desire and\naction. A pronounced ethic of moderation, sometimes bordering on\nasceticism, runs through much of ancient Greek ethical thought,\nbeginning with Solon and Xenophanes and continuing through Socrates\nand Plato to the Epicureans and Cynics. Xenophanes\u2019 conception\nof a \u201cone greatest god\u201d who \u201cshakes all things by\nthe thought (or will) of his mind\u201d (noou phreni) may\nhave helped to encourage Heraclitus\u2019 belief in an\n\u2018intelligence\u2019 (gn\u00f4m\u00ea) that steers\nall things (B41), Anaxagoras\u2019 account of the nous that\norders and arranges all things (B12), and Aristotle\u2019s account of\na divine nous that inspires a movement toward perfection\nwithout actually doing anything toward bringing it about\n(Metaphysics Lambda.)\n\nIn his Dictionnaire historique et critique (1697) Pierre Bayle began\nthe modern philosophical discussion of the problem of evil by quoting\nXenophanes\u2019 remark (as reported in Diogenes Laertius 9.19) that\n\u201cmost things give way to mind\u201d (ta polla\nh\u00eass\u00f4 nou). Accepting the conjecture proposed by the\nclassical scholar M\u00e9ric Casaubon, Bayle took Xenophanes to be\nasserting that God was unable to make all things conform to his\nbenevolent will. Bayle then assembled a set of texts in support of the\nview that in fact the amount of evil in the universe far exceeds the\namount of good. Bayle\u2019s article sparked a reply from Leibniz (in\nhis Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e of 1710). In his Candide (1759), Voltaire\nsupported Bayle\u2019s view by ridiculing Leibniz\u2019s contention\nthat this is the best of all possible worlds. Although there may be no\ndirect line of influence, we may also consider Feuerbach\u2019s\ncritique of religious belief as a \u2018projection\u2019 of human\nattributes, and Freud\u2019s analysis of religious belief as an\ninstance of \u2018wish-fulfillment\u2019, as two modern successors\nto Xenophanes\u2019 observation of the general tendency of human\nbeings to conceive of divine beings in terms of their own attributes\nand capacities.\n\nXenophanes\u2019 most enduring philosophical contribution was\narguably his pioneering exploration of the conditions under which\nhuman beings can achieve knowledge of the certain truth. The\ndistinction between knowledge and true opinion set out in B34 quickly\nbecame an axiom of ancient Greek accounts of knowledge and survives in\nmodern garb as the \u2018belief\u2019 and \u2018truth\u2019\nconditions of the \u2018standard\u2019 or \u2018tripartite\nanalysis\u2019 of knowledge. It can be plausibly argued that every\nlater Greek thinker, at least until the time of Aristotle, undertook\nto respond to the basic challenge posed in Xenophanes\u2019\nB34\u2014how, given the severely limited character of human\nexperience, anyone can plausibly claim to have discovered the truth\nabout matters lying beyond anyone\u2019s capacity to observe\nfirst-hand. Xenophanes may also be credited with expanding the range\nof topics considered appropriate for philosophical inquiry and\ndiscussion. His Ionian predecessors had initiated the study of\nphenomena \u201cabove the heavens and below the earth\u201d but, so\nfar as we know, they did not turn their critical fire against the\nleading poets of ancient Greece nor did they seek through their\nteachings to correct or improve the conduct of their fellow citizens.\nAlthough many aspects of his thought remain the subject of scholarly\ndebate, Xenophanes was clearly a multi-dimensional thinker who left\nhis mark on many aspects of later Greek thought.\n",
