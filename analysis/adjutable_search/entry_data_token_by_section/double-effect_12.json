One principle or many loosely related exceptions to a general prohibition on causing grave harms?\n\nIt is not at all clear that all of the examples that double effect has\nbeen invoked to justify can be explained by a single principle, since\nthere may be a variety of considerations that bear on the\npermissibility of causing grave harms in particular contexts. Perhaps\nall of these cases have in common the feature that the agent acts to\npromote a good end in a permissible manner and regrets any harms that\nare involved. For some proponents of double effect, these facts are\nenough to show that the harms that are caused should be described as\nmerely foreseen side effects.\n\nCritics of the use of double effect as an explanatory principle point\nout that the proportionality condition is vague and too general,\nrequiring only that the good effect outweigh the foreseen bad effect\nor that there be sufficient reason for causing the bad effect. These\ncritics add that when substantive principles that explain the\npermissibility of causing the kind of harm in question are explicitly\nformulated, these principles are doing all of the justificatory work\n(Davis 1984; McIntyre 2001). These substantive considerations are not\nderived from double effect and in some cases do not support the\ntraditional applications of double effect. If this criticism is\ncorrect, then perhaps the cases that have traditionally been cited as\napplications of the principle of double effect are united only by the\nfact that each is an exception to the general prohibition on causing\nthe death of a human being.\n\nThe historical origins of the principle of double effect as a tenet of\nCatholic casuistry might explain the appearance that there is a single\nprinciple with diverse applications. If one were to assume that it is\nabsolutely prohibited to cause the death of a human being, then it\nwould be impermissible to kill an aggressor in self-defense, to\nsacrifice one\u2019s life to protect others, to hasten death as a\nside effect of administering sedation for intractable pain, to\nendanger non-combatants in warfare, to undertake risky surgery to save\na patient\u2019s life, to perform a hysterectomy on a pregnant woman\nin order to save her life, or to swerve the trolley. However, if one\nwere to assume instead that what is absolutely prohibited is to cause\nthe death of a human being intentionally, then these cases\ncan be viewed as cases in which one might permissibly cause death\nregretfully viewing the death as a \u201cmerely foreseen side\neffect\u201d of pursuing a good end.\n\nHowever, as we have seen, it is hard to make sense of the idea that\nthe soldier who throws himself on a grenade does not view his\nself-sacrifice as a means of protecting his fellow soldiers, or that\nthe physician who performs a hysterectomy on a pregnant woman does not\nsee the removal of the fetus as part of the life-saving procedure. It\nis true that we could emphasize the soldier\u2019s motive by talking\nabout what he intended: that his intention was not to cause his own\ndeath but to protect the lives of his fellow soldiers, or that the\nphysician who performs a hysterectomy on a pregnant woman to save her\nlife did not intend to kill the child, only to remove a cancerous\nuterus containing a fetus. But in the same way we could say of someone\nwho ended her life: her intention was not to kill herself but to bring\nher suffering to an end; and of someone who killed an enemy he\nsuspected of plotting against him that the did not intend to kill the\nenemy but instead intended to insure his own future security. This way\nof speaking amounts to saying that the harm that the agent caused was\nchosen as a means to the agent\u2019s end and was not\npursued for its own sake. But double effect is supposed to condemn,\nnot to justify, grave harms intended as a means to a good end.\n\nSome have developed this kind of criticism by arguing that the appeal\nof the principle of double effect is, fundamentally, illusory: an\nagent\u2019s intentions are not relevant to the permissibility of an\naction in the way that the proponents of the principle of double\neffect would claim, though an agent\u2019s intentions are relevant to\nmoral assessments of the way in which the agent deliberated (see\nMcCarthy 2002; Scanlon 2008). That an agent intended to bring about a\ncertain harm does not make an otherwise permissible action\nimpermissible, but it can explain what is morally faulty about the\nagent\u2019s reasoning in pursuing that line of action.\n",
