    "main_text": "The Nocturnal Council and Political Participation\n6. The Nocturnal Council and Political Participation\n\nA second, more longstanding, controversy about the Laws\nconcerns the role of the body known as the \u201cNocturnal\nCouncil\u201d which is so-called because it meets daily from dawn\nuntil sunrise when everyone has the most leisure from public and\nprivate activities (Laws\n 961B6\u20138).[33]\n The Nocturnal Council is first explicitly mentioned in Book 10 (but\nis alluded to earlier at Laws 632C4\u20136 and\n818A1\u20133) where it is assigned an educational function. Those who\nhave violated Magnesia\u2019s impiety laws due to ignorance, rather\nthan bad character, are to be imprisoned for five years. During their\nimprisonment, the members of the Nocturnal Council meet with them in\norder to reform their beliefs by teaching (Laws 909A). The\nNocturnal Council\u2019s membership seems to include:\n\nthe 10 oldest guardians of the laws,\nthe current supervisor of education and his predecessors,\nexaminers (officials who check the qualifications of those\nentering office and audit them when they leave office) and other\ncitizens who have won awards of honor,\ncertain citizens who have traveled abroad under official auspices\nto gather knowledge and have been invited to participate by the\nNocturnal Council itself, and\neach of the above members is to nominate for membership (whose\nacceptance is subject to the approval of the other members) a younger\nassociate between the ages of 30 and 40 (Laws 951D4\u2013E5\nand 961A1\u2013B6).\n\n\nIn Book 12, the Athenian returns to the Nocturnal Council and\nemphasizes its great importance for the city. The following passage\nfrom Book 12 has encouraged some to think that Plato here grants the\nNocturnal Council very great, or even unlimited, political power.\n\nIf this divine council should come into being for us, dear friends,\nthe city ought to be handed over to it [paradoteon tout\u00f4i\nt\u00ean polin] (Laws 969B2\u20133, cf.\n960B5\u2013E11 and 961C3\u20136)\n\n\nSome scholars have held, on the basis of these passages, that Plato\nintends the Nocturnal Council to be the main political authority in\nMagnesia. On this view, either it will have the same powers as did the\nphilosopher kings in the Republic to change laws and\ninstitutions as it sees fit or the extent of its powers will simply be\nleft to the Nocturnal Council itself to\n determine.[34]\n Such an interpretation has, however, quite high costs. As its main\ncontemporary proponent concedes, it requires us to see the\nLaws as inconsistent: the earlier provisions of political\nauthority to various offices are incompatible with assigning such\nunlimited powers to the Nocturnal\n Council.[35]\n Further, such a grant of power is at least in serious tension with\none of the Laws\u2019 basic political principles. Repeatedly\nin the Laws, Plato emphasizes that allowing any magistrate or\npolitical body unchecked authority runs too great a risk of the abuse\nof power. Such a risk is still too great even if the possessors of\npower have genuine knowledge: even those with full knowledge are\nsubject to corruption in such\n circumstances.[36]\n\nOther interpreters, such as Glenn Morrow, have suggested that the\nNocturnal Council\u2019s role is primarily\n informal.[37]\n This Council is to possess various sorts of knowledge and it must\nalso educate its own members. Even without possessing powers beyond\nthose explicitly assigned to it, the Nocturnal Council should exercise\na considerable influence on Magnesia\u2019s governance. Its members\ninclude some of the city\u2019s most important officials. Plato would\ncertainly expect that these officials\u2019 administration of the\nlaws and revision of them \u2013 if this is permitted \u2013 will be\ninformed by their studies. Perhaps even more important, the younger\nassociate members of the Nocturnal Council will come to fill many\noffices of the state and will exercise an informal, but still\nsignificant, influence on other citizens in the deliberations that\nplay such an important role in Magnesia\u2019s system of government,\nas well as in their other contacts with their fellows.\n\nThere is, however, a third option. Morrow adopts his\n\u201cinformal\u201d interpretation in part because Plato does not\nexplicitly assign to the Nocturnal Council any powers beyond those we\nhave noted. But one could hold that the Laws is not intended\nto provide a fully determinate blueprint of the just\n city.[38]\n On this interpretation, there is an open texture to the political and\nsocial institutions that Plato sketches and we should allow for a\nrange of ways of implementing the basic structure. For example, Plato\nappears to assign to the \u201cguardians of the laws\u201d (the\nnomophulakes) some important role in revising Magnesia\u2019s laws.\nIn his Book 12 discussion, Plato describes the members of the\nNocturnal Council as \u201cthose who will really be guardians of the\nlaws\u201d (Laws 966B5). The members of the Nocturnal\nCouncil will, if properly educated, be \u201cmade into guardians\nwhose like, with respect to the virtue of safekeeping, we have not\nseen come into being in our lives previously\u201d (Laws\n969C2\u20133). We need not see these claims as a volte-face on\nPlato\u2019s part, if we allow for a range of ways in which the\noutline of Magnesia sketched can be realized that fall between\nexcluding the Nocturnal Council from any political role at all and\nseeing them as philosopher kings in disguise. We can thus allow that\nthe Nocturnal Council is intended to have genuine political authority\ngoing beyond its explicitly stated responsibilities that still falls\nwell short of autocratic power, without expecting the\nLaws\u2019 text to make this authority fully\ndeterminate.\n\nBut in addition to the specific issue of the extent of the Nocturnal\nCouncil\u2019s powers, there is a deeper question. The more political\nauthority that is assigned to the Nocturnal Council, the more\npolitically passive most citizens of Magnesia will be. Thus the\nquestion about the power of the Nocturnal Council has significant\nimplications for our evaluation of the ethical capacities of\nnon-philosophical citizens. If their education really does give them\nsome rational appreciation of the principles underlying the laws of\nMagnesia, we should expect that they can, to a significant degree, be\nfree from detailed regulation and supervision by others. Further, not\nonly is it the case that they will be capable of being free from such\nregulation, but we should expect that deliberating and acting upon\ntheir grasp of ethical principles forms an important part of their own\n good.[39]\n If, however, their political activity is reduced to the level of the\ntwo lower classes in the Republic, who have little or no part\nin political deliberation or judicial administration, we might think\nthat Plato has the same fairly low estimate of the ethical capacities\nof ordinary citizens in both works. Resolving the issue of the\nNocturnal Council\u2019s powers thus has broad implications for our\nunderstanding of Plato\u2019s later ethics.\n",
