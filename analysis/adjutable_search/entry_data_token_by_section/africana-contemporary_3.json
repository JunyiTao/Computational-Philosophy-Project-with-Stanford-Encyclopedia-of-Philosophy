    "main_text": "Framing conditions: coloniality, heterodoxy, and historicity\n2. Framing conditions: coloniality, heterodoxy, and historicity\n\nStudies of Africana philosophy and its subfields routinely begin by\nacknowledging that these became recognized areas of professional\nscholarly study only recently. These acknowledgments implicate three\nframing conditions that are crucial for understanding the field.\n\nThe first condition has to do with a version of what Elena Ru\u00edz\ncalls \u201cepistemic imperialism.\u201d This is her name for states\nof affairs in which hegemonic modes of epistemic practice\n\u201creproduce interpretive conditions favorable to the dominant\nassumptions.\u201d Philosophical activity under these conditions\n\u201ccreates and maintains interpretive spaces in philosophy that\nare self-confirming rather than culturally open and plural,\u201d and\nalso \u201cclears the way for the devaluation of non-dominant\nintellectual traditions through tacit methodological\nassumptions\u201d (Ru\u00edz 2018, 52\u201353). What this means is\nthat oppressive conditions exclude their victims from knowledge\nproduction not simply by preventing people with certain bodies,\nbackgrounds, beliefs, or other distinguishing features from entering\nthe institutions charged with knowledge work, but also by engineering\nthe conceptual and theoretical tools to promote epistemic numbness and\nturn exclusion into erasure.\n\nIssues of epistemic imperialism bear on Africana philosophy because\nhegemonic institutions have historically recognized, and to a\nconsiderable degree still recognize, philosophic interventions as\nachieving scholarly respectability by appeal to standards calibrated\nto colonial and apartheid imperatives. One very short version of this\nstory is that the most influential university systems in the\ncontemporary world\u2014including in Africa and the\nCaribbean\u2014started as the creations and tools of European\ncolonial powers or settler colonial authorities. (This is only one\nversion of the story because it is not, of course, a story simply\nabout university systems. It is also a story about, among other\nthings, publishing houses, dictionaries, the word\n\u201cphilosophy,\u201d and the baggage that European elite cultures\nattached to all of these things. Outlaw and Gordon also tell this\nstory well.) Consequently, and not surprisingly, it was only in the\nyears after colonized peoples won formal independence and apartheid\nregimes formally embraced democracy that these institutions began in\nany thoroughgoing way to credit research programs and curricular\ninitiatives not animated by assumptions about African backwardness,\nsavagery, or barbarism.\n\nThe fact that it took many, many years for hegemonic Euro-modern\ninquirers to begin to disentangle epistemic norms from colonial and\napartheid imperatives highlights the second contextual consideration,\ncall this \u201cthe condition of heterodoxy.\u201d Much of the work\nthat sets the agenda for Africana philosophy was produced largely\noutside of the forums that elite European-influenced intellectual\ncultures considered respectable. In some cases, this meant that\nAfrican-descended scholars worked in alternative, often racially\nsegregated, institutions and shared their research in alternative\nspaces. In other cases, it meant that these scholars worked on the\nmargins of mainstream institutions, enjoying or enduring highly\nconstrained interactions with the people who under different\ncircumstances would have been their colleagues and interlocutors. In\nthe vast majority of cases, it meant that people in African and\nAfrican-descended communities refined and employed their own\nmechanisms for producing knowledge. In all of these cases, it meant\nthat Africana intellectual work was importantly heretical or\nheterodox.\n\nAfricana philosophy\u2019s relatively recent arrival on the scene of\n\u201crespectable\u201d knowledge production points to the third\nframing condition for the field, its manifest historicity. The\nfield\u2019s unavoidable status as an artifact of evolving\nsociopolitical conditions puts historical dynamics at issue here in a\nway that other fields (outside of the history of philosophy) can\nusually evade. Because of this, a study of contemporary activity must\nbegin by attending to the development of the field over time, on at\nleast three levels. It is important to attend to the development of\ncertain ideas and to the canonization of certain texts and figures, to\nconsider the evolving social and institutional conditions under which\nAfricana philosophers did their work, and to credit the degree to\nwhich reconsiderations of the history constitute a thriving area of\ncontemporary study.\n",
