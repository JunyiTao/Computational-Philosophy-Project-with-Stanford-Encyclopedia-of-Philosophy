    "main_text": "The Course on Positive Philosophy and the Friendship with Mill || The law of the three stages\n4.1 The law of the three stages\n\nThe structure of the Course explains why the law of the three\nstages (which is often the only thing known about Comte) is stated\ntwice. Properly speaking, the law belongs to dynamic sociology or\ntheory of social progress, and this is why it serves as an\nintroduction to the long history lessons in the fifth and sixth\nvolumes. But it equally serves as an introduction to the work as a\nwhole, to the extent that its author considers this law the best way\nto explain what positive philosophy is.\n\nThe law states that, in its development, humanity passes through three\nsuccessive stages: the theological, the metaphysical, and the\npositive. The first is the necessary starting point for the human\nmind; the last, its normal state; the second is but a transitory stage\nthat makes possible the passage from the first to the last. In the\ntheological stage, the human mind, in its search for the primary and\nfinal causes of phenomena, explains the apparent anomalies in the\nuniverse as interventions of supernatural agents. The second stage is\nonly a simple modification of the first: the questions remain the\nsame, but in the answers supernatural agents are replaced by abstract\nentities. In the positive state, the mind stops looking for causes of\nphenomena, and limits itself strictly to laws governing them;\nlikewise, absolute notions are replaced by relative ones. Moreover, if\none considers material development, the theological stage may also be\ncalled military, and the positive stage industrial; the metaphysical\nstage corresponds to a supremacy of the lawyers and\n jurists.[2].\n\nThis relativism of the third stage is the most characteristic property\nof positivism. It is often mistakenly identified with scepticism, but\nour earlier remark about dogmatism prevents us from doing so.\n\nFor Comte, science is a \u201cconnaissance approch\u00e9e\u201d:\nit comes closer and closer to truth, without reaching it. There is no\nplace for absolute truth, but neither are there higher standards for\nthe fixation of belief. Comte is here quite close to Peirce in his\nfamous 1877 paper.\n\nThe law of the three stages belongs to those grand philosophies of\nhistory elaborated in the 19th century, which now seem quite alien to\nus (for a different opinion, see Schmaus (1982)). The idea of progress\nof Humanity appears to us as the expression of an optimism that the\nevents of the 20th century have done much to reduce (Bourdeau 2006).\nMore generally, the notion of a law of history is problematic (even\nthough it did not seem so to Mill (1842, bk. VI, chap. X)). Already\nDurkheim felt forced to exclude social dynamics from sociology, in\norder to give it a truly scientific status.\n\nThese difficulties, however, are far from fatal to this aspect of\nComte\u2019s thought. Putting aside the fact that the idea of moral\nprogress is slowly regaining some support, it is possible to interpret\nthe three stages as forms of the mind that co-exist whose relative\nimportance varies in time. This interpretation seems to be offered by\nComte himself, who gives several examples of it in his history\nlessons. The germs of positivity were present from the beginning of\nthe theological stage; with Descartes, the whole of natural philosophy\nreaches the positive stage, while moral philosophy remains in the\nmetaphysical stage (1830 (58), v. 2, 714\u2013715).\n",
