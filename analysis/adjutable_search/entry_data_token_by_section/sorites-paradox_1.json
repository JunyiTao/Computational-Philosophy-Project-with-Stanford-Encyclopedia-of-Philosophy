    "main_text": "Different Formulations of the Paradox\n2. Different Formulations of the Paradox\n\nAt least three conditions must be met for an argument to be an\ninstance of the sorites paradox. (1) It must be possible to construct\na sorites series for the predicate in question, viz., a\nfinitely-membered ordering of values on a dimension decisive of the\npredicate\u2019s application. A sorites series for \u2018tall\u2019\nis an ordering on the dimension of height (an ordering of heights),\nfor \u2018old\u2019 an ordering on the dimension of age (an ordering\nof ages), and so forth. (2) Neighboring values in the series must be\nonly incrementally different, i.e., either indiscriminable or just\nslightly different. An incremental difference is supposed to guarantee\nthat if a vague predicate applies to one of a pair of neighbors, it\napplies equally to the other. (Following Wright [e.g., 1975], the\nproperty of applying across incremental differences on a decisive\ndimension is often called the tolerance of a vague term.) (3)\nThe predicate must be true of the first value in the series and false\nof the last.\n\nThe paradox is often presented in the conditional form discussed\nabove. More formally: let \u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 be a soritical\npredicate and let \u2018\\(\\alpha_{n}\\)\u2019 (where n is a\nnatural number) represent a value in a sorites series for\n\u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019. Then the paradox can be represented most\nsimply this way, using Modus Ponens:\n\nConditional Sorites  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\Phi\\alpha_{1}\\\\\n&\\textrm{If } \\Phi\\alpha_{1} \\textrm{ then } \\Phi\\alpha_{2}\\\\\n&\\textrm{If } \\Phi\\alpha_{2} \\textrm{ then } \\Phi\\alpha_{3}\\\\\n&\\textrm{Etc.}\\\\\n&\\textrm{If } \\Phi\\alpha_{n-1} \\textrm{ then } \\Phi\\alpha_{n}\\\\\\hline\n&\\Phi\\alpha_{n} \\textrm{ (where \\(n\\) can be arbitrarily large)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nA different formulation of the paradox replaces the set of conditional\npremises with a universal generalization and proceeds by mathematical\ninduction. Let \u2018n\u2019 be a variable ranging over the\nnatural numbers and let \u2018\\(\\forall n(\\ldots n\\ldots)\\)\u2019\nassert that every number n satisfies the condition\n...n.... Further, let us represent the claim \u2018For any\n\\(n\\), if \\(\\alpha_n\\) is \\(\\Phi\\) then \\(\\alpha_{n+1}\\) is\n\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 as \u2018\\(\\forall n (\\Phi\\alpha_n \\rightarrow\n\\Phi\\alpha_{n+1})\\)\u2019. \n\nMathematical Induction Sorites \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\Phi\\alpha_1 \\\\\n&\\forall n (\\Phi\\alpha_n \\rightarrow \\Phi\\alpha_{n+1}) \\\\\\hline\n&\\forall n(\\Phi \\alpha_n)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nFor example, since a man with 1 hair on his head is bald, and since,\nfor any number of hairs n, if a man with n hairs is bald\nthen so is a man with n+1 hairs, every number n is such\nthat a man with n hairs on his head is bald.\n\nAnother version of the puzzle is a variant of the inductive form. We\nknow that a sorites series for \u2018bald\u2019 contains some\nnumbers of hairs such that men having those numbers of hairs are not\nbald. By the least number principle (equivalent to the principle of\nmathematical induction) there must be a least number, say i+1,\nsuch that a man with i+1 hairs on his head is not bald. Since a\nman with 1 hair on his head is bald, it follows that i+1 must\nbe greater than 1. Hence the series contains a number of hairs\nn (=i) such that a man with n hairs is bald\nwhilst a man with n+1 hairs is not. Let \u2018\\(\\exists\nn(\\ldots n\\ldots)\\)\u2019 assert that some number n satisfies\nthe condition ...n.... Then we can schematize the latter\nreasoning this way:\n\nLine-drawing Sorites \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\Phi\\alpha_1 \\\\\n&{\\sim}\\forall n(\\Phi \\alpha_n) \\\\\\hline\n&\\exists n \\ge 1 (\\Phi\\alpha_{n} \\amp {\\sim}\\Phi\\alpha_{n+1})\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe line-drawing and inductive forms of the puzzle illustrate well the\nsoritical predicament; apparently, competent users of\n\u2018bald\u2019 both must, and must not, draw a line in the series.\nFor convenience in what follows, most of the examples are framed in\nterms of the conditional or inductive forms of the paradox. Of course,\nan adequate resolution of the sorites will presumably need to disarm\nall versions of it.\n\nWe should mention also an informal version of the paradox, known as\nthe \u201cforced march sorites\u201d (Horgan 1994a; Soames 1999).\nHere it is framed in terms of the hypothetical classifications that\nwould be made by a competent speaker proceeding step by step along a\nsorites series. A competent speaker must say that a single grain of\nwheat does not make a heap; but if that\u2019s right, then she must\nalso say that two grains do not make a heap; and that three grains\ndon\u2019t; and so on until she must say that, e.g., one million\ngrains don\u2019t make a heap. As will emerge, the forced march\nsorites plays an important role in several treatments of the\nparadox.\n\nIt is worth noting that the popular definition of vagueness in terms\nof soriticality (e.g., Wright 1976; Bueno & Colyvan 2012) may well\nbe incorrect. If the sorites is a resolvable fallacy, as most\ntheorists of vagueness believe, then vagueness is not after all a\nsource of paradox. Maybe someone will say that even after the correct\ndiagnosis of the puzzle has been discovered, the argument will remain\na paradox because it will still appear to consist in\nunimpeachable reasoning from true premises to a false conclusion. But\nsuch a view makes vagueness far too contingent a property; for all we\nknow, once we have discovered the proper solution to the puzzle, the\nmajor premise will no longer appear true. It may appear true to the\nuninitiated, but this too would be a dubious way to define\nvagueness\u2014viz., as the property of generating an\nargument that previously appeared, or appears to the uninitiated,\nparadoxical. Bueno and Colyvan say that \u201ca predicate is vague\njust in case it can be employed to generate a sorites argument\u201d\n(2012). But what does \u2018can be employed\u2019 mean here? If a\nsorites argument is a fallacy, a vague predicate cannot be\ncorrectly employed in it. Is the criterion supposed to be\nthat a vague predicate is a term which, when employed incorrectly,\nappears temporarily (to the uninitiated?) to generate a sorites\nparadox? (Raffman 2014: 18\u201319)\n\nIn all likelihood, soriticality is an illusory feature of words like\n\u2018old\u2019 and \u2018rich\u2019; their vagueness is real. If\nthat\u2019s right, then apparent soriticality may be best viewed as a\ntemporary symptom of vagueness, or perhaps as an element of\nits \u201csurface characterization\u201d (Smith 2008, e.g., 132; see\nSmith\u2019s third chapter for insight as to what vagueness is).\n",
