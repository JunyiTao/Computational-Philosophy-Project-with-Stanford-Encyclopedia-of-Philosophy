    "main_text": "The Argument from Superdominance\n2. The Argument from Superdominance\n\nPascal maintains that we are incapable of knowing whether God exists\nor not, yet we must \u201cwager\u201d one way or the other. Reason\ncannot settle which way we should incline, but a consideration of the\nrelevant outcomes supposedly can. Here is the first key passage:\n\n\u201cGod is, or He is not.\u201d But to which side shall we\nincline? Reason can decide nothing here. There is an infinite chaos\nwhich separated us. A game is being played at the extremity of this\ninfinite distance where heads or tails will turn up\u2026 Which will\nyou choose then? Let us see. Since you must choose, let us see which\ninterests you least. You have two things to lose, the true and the\ngood; and two things to stake, your reason and your will, your\nknowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to shun,\nerror and misery. Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one\nrather than the other, since you must of necessity choose\u2026 But\nyour happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that\nGod is\u2026 If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose\nnothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.\n\n\nThere are exegetical problems already here, partly because Pascal\nappears to contradict himself. He speaks of \u201cthe true\u201d as\nsomething that you can \u201close\u201d, and \u201cerror\u201d as\nsomething \u201cto shun\u201d. Yet he goes on to claim that if you\nlose the wager that God is, then \u201cyou lose nothing\u201d.\nSurely in that case you \u201close the true\u201d, which is just to\nsay that you have made an error, and since this is something \u201cto\nshun\u201d, it is presumably a cost.\u00a0Pascal believes, of course,\nthat the existence of God is \u201cthe true\u201d\u2014but\nthat is not something that he can appeal to in this argument.\nMoreover, it is not because \u201cyou must of necessity choose\u201d\nthat \u201cyour reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather than\nthe other\u201d. Rather, by Pascal\u2019s own account, it is because\n\u201c[r]eason can decide nothing here\u201d. (If it could, then it\nmight well be shocked\u2014namely, if you chose in a way contrary to\nit.)\n\nFollowing McClennen 1994, Pascal\u2019s argument seems to be best\ncaptured as presenting the following decision table:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGod exists\nGod does not exist \n\nWager for God\nGain all\nStatus quo \n\nWager against God\nMisery\nStatus quo  \n\n\nWagering for God superdominates wagering against God: the worst\noutcome associated with wagering for God (status quo) is at least as\ngood as the best outcome associated with wagering against God (status\nquo); and if God exists, the result of wagering for God is strictly\nbetter than the result of wagering against God. (The fact that the\nresult is much better does not matter yet.) Pascal draws the\nconclusion at this point that you should wager for God.\n\nWithout any assumption about your probability assignment to\nGod\u2019s existence, the argument is invalid. Rationality does\nnot require you to wager for God if you assign probability 0\nto God existing, as a strict atheist might. And Pascal does not\nexplicitly rule this possibility out until a later passage, when he\nassumes that you assign positive probability to God\u2019s existence;\nyet this argument is presented as if it is self-contained. His claim\nthat \u201c[r]eason can decide nothing here\u201d may suggest that\nPascal regards this as a decision under uncertainty, which is to\nassume that you do not assign probability at all to\nGod\u2019s existence. If that is a further premise, then the argument\nis apparently valid; but that premise contradicts his subsequent\nassumption that you assign positive probability. See McClennen for a\nreading of this argument as a decision under uncertainty.\n\nPascal appears to be aware of a further objection to this argument,\nfor he immediately imagines an opponent replying:\n\n\u201cThat is very fine. Yes, I must wager; but I may perhaps wager\ntoo much.\u201d\n\n\nThe thought seems to be that if I wager for God, and God does not\nexist, then I really do lose something. In fact, Pascal himself speaks\nof staking something when one wagers for God, which\npresumably one loses if God does not exist. (We have already mentioned\n\u2018the true\u2019 as one such thing; Pascal also seems to regard\none\u2019s worldly life as another.) In that case, the table is\nmistaken in presenting the two outcomes under \u2018God does not\nexist\u2019 as if they were the same, and we do not have a case of\nsuperdominance after all.\n\nPascal addresses this at once in his second argument, which we will\ndiscuss only briefly, as it can be thought of as just a prelude to the\nmain argument.\n",
