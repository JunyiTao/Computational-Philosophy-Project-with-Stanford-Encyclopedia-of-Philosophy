    "main_text": "Meritocratic Justice || The meritocratic distribution of jobs\n4.2 The meritocratic distribution of jobs\n\nMeritocratic hiring is often described using the language of\ndiscrimination. It is unjust, according the meritocrat, to\ndiscriminate against applicants for a job on any ground other than\nmerit:\n\n\nAccording to a widely held view, when there are a number of applicants\nfor an available job, justice demands that the job be offered to the\nbest-qualified applicant. We express this by saying that \u2026 the\nprinciple involved is one of hiring by merit. This is the principle\nthat condemns discrimination on grounds of sex, race, or religion when\nhiring employees, as well, of course, as good old-fashioned nepotism.\n(David Miller 1999: 156)\n\n\nThis is the moral principle seemingly at work (as Schmidtz [2006]\npoints out) in Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s famous \u201cI Have a\nDream\u201d speech, in which King yearns that his children \u201cnot\nbe judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their\ncharacter\u201d. For the meritocrat, racial discrimination is morally\nwrong because all non-merit-based discrimination is\nwrong.\n\nThe principle has been operationalized. In \u201cblind\nauditions\u201d, pioneered by symphony orchestras, applicants play\nbehind screens so that the jury cannot discover their race, sex,\nappearance, etc. and can only assess the quality of the\nperformance.\n\nIn the United States, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was defended, in\npart, on meritocratic grounds (see Kershnar 2003). The Act prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin,\nand sex. (The U.S. Supreme Court later decided\u2014in Bostock v.\nClayton County\u2014that discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation and gender identity runs afoul of the Act\u2019s\ninjunction against sex-based discrimination, and so is illegal.)\n\nLacking a theory of merit\n (\u00a72.1),\n it is not always clear which features of applicants count as merits\nand which do not. In toy cases\u2014say, hiring a new\nbricklayer\u2014things are simple. A bricklayer must be\nstrong, reliable, precise in his work, and\nso on. Race, gender, and appearance are obviously irrelevant to\nbricklaying.\n\nIn the real world, things are murkier. One example of this is\n\u201creaction qualifications\u201d (Wertheimer 1983). These are\n\n\nqualifications that count as such because of the reactions of\nrecipients, where the recipients are those with whom the successful\ncandidate will interact as a result of filling the relevant position.\n(Mason 2017:\n 49)[4]\n\n\nThe taste discrimination case considered in\n \u00a72.1\n involves a reaction qualification which is not a bona fide\nmerit. Racist customers may react positively to a saleswoman of their\npreferred race. But her race is not a merit. On the other hand,\ncustomers will buy more widgets from a saleswoman who is\npersonable, and that is a merit.\n\nBetween these there are difficult cases. Suppose the saleswoman is\nbeautiful, and her beauty entices customers to buy from her\nwhen they otherwise would not. Is beauty a merit in the context of\nselling widgets? In the context of modeling? Working at McDonalds? Is\nbeing a woman a merit in the context of gynecology (because many women\nwould prefer a female doctor)? A satisfying conceptual analysis of\nmerit would distinguish meritocratic reaction qualifications from\nnon-meritocratic reaction qualifications.\n\nA salient and philosophically interesting issue is affirmative action.\nSome forms of affirmative action do not appear to conflict with\nmeritocratic hiring. For example, making special efforts to solicit\napplicants from historically underrepresented groups and then judging\nthose applicants (along with everyone else) on the basis of merit\nseems compatible.\n\nBut the crux of affirmative action\u2014quotas and preferential\ntreatment\u2014is incompatible with meritocratic hiring. As Robert\nFullinwider (2002 [2018]) says, \u201cthe aims of real world\naffirmative action make race and ethnicity (and sometimes gender)\nsalient, not personal desert or merit\u201d. (See also Nagel\n1973.)\n\nAffirmative action thus helpfully puts the question to meritocratic\njustice. For some, affirmative action\u2019s incompatibility with\nmeritocracy reveals that affirmative action is unjust. For others,\nthis incompatibility is evidence that meritocracy is an erroneous view\nof justice.\n\nThree notes on this. First, meritocrats\u2019 resistance to\naffirmative action should be viewed in light of their commitment to\nequal opportunity\n (\u00a72.3).\n Their argument is not that there are no racial injustices, but that\nthe proper remedy is bolstering equal opportunity rather than quotas /\npreferential treatment.\n\nSecond, affirmative action again illustrates the cleavage between\nmerit and consequences. It might be the case that hiring on the basis\nof race or gender produces better consequences, owing to, for\ninstance, the benefits of a diverse workforce. For the meritocrat,\nthat is irrelevant\u2014it remains unjust, because\ndiscriminatory.\n\nThird, all that said, meritocratic hiring and affirmative action are\nnot necessarily incompatible. Suppose, for example, that there exists\n\u201cimplicit bias\u201d against some group\u2014that is,\nselectors unconsciously regard members of that group as less\nmeritorious than they actually are. If so, then by showing\n\u201cpreference\u201d to members of this group, selectors would\nmerely nullify the bias and ensure that every candidate is judged on\nhis merits. Obviously, whether implicit bias exists is an empirical\nissue. As of now, it is a hotly debated one (see, e.g., Jussim et al.\nforthcoming).\n",
