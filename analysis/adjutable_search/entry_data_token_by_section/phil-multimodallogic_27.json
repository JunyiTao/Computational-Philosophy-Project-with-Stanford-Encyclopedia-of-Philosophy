    "main_text": "Multi-Modal Systems in Philosophical Discussions || The paradox of the perfect believer\n5.3 The paradox of the perfect believer\n\nOn first sight it seems natural to say that one can believe to\n\u2018know\u2019 something, even when in fact one does not actually\nknow it. So believing to know something is philosophically conceived\nto be different from claiming true knowledge. Yet, under the\nassumption that what is known is also believed, this specific\ninterplay between modalities for knowledge and belief can lead us into\ntrouble if we identify belief with a KD45-modality\nB, and knowledge with a S5-modality for\nK. For suppose \\(BK\\varphi \\land \\lnot K\\varphi\\) is assumed.\nThen, by negative introspection of the second conjunct, we derive\n\\(K\\lnot K\\varphi\\). But as knowledge implies belief, we derive\n\\(B\\lnot K\\varphi\\). This together with the first conjunct\n\\(BK\\varphi\\) will give us, by additivity of belief, \\(B(K\\varphi\n\\land \\lnot K\\varphi)\\). Hence we derive the belief in a\ncontradiction, which is not compatible with the assumption of\nconsistency of beliefs (axiom D) in\nKD45. This problem is known as the paradox of the\nperfect believer (and also as the Voorbraak paradox), as it\nwas originally (but equivalently) described (Voorbraak 1993) as the\nderivability of the bridge principle \\(BK\\varphi \\rightarrow\nK\\varphi\\), which states that a belief in knowing a given \\(\\varphi\\)\nis enough to know \\(\\varphi\\). (The derivation of \\(BK\\varphi\n\\rightarrow K\\varphi\\) also relies on the negative introspection of\nknowledge, the normality and consistency of beliefs, and the bridge\nprinciple stating that knowledge implies belief; Gochet &\nGribomont 2006: 114.)\n\nAfter presenting this problem, Voorbraak (1993) proposed to deal with\nit by discarding the bridge principle \\(K\\varphi \\rightarrow\n{B\\varphi}\\). Another option is to allow inconsistent beliefs (Gochet\n& Gribomont 2006: Section 2.6). Still, a further possible\nsolution, closer to the spirit of these notes, is to consider an\nintermediate notion of \u2019knowledge\u2019 that is not as strong\nas the absolute irrevisable (i.e., irrevocable) notion given by the\nS5 modal operator K. More precisely, the\nproposal in Baltag and Smets (2008) looks at Lehrer\u2019s\ndefeasibility theory of knowledge (Lehrer 1990; Lehrer &\nPaxson 1969), and works with the indefeasible (\u201cweak\u201d,\nnon-negatively-introspective) knowledge given, in the\n plausibility models\n discussed above, by the modality \\([\\leq]\\) (read before also as\nsafe belief). Indeed, Lehrer and Stalnaker call this concept\ndefeasible knowledge, a form of knowledge that might be\ndefeated by false evidence, but cannot be defeated by\ntrue evidence. The concept satisfies both the truth axiom\n\\(([\\leq]\\varphi \\rightarrow \\varphi)\\) and positive introspection\n\\(([\\leq]\\varphi \\rightarrow [\\leq][\\leq]\\varphi)\\), but it lacks\nnegative introspection; thus, the previous derivation of inconsistent\nbeliefs from an agent mistakenly believing that she (defeasibly) knows\n\\(\\varphi\\) \\(({B[\\leq]\\varphi} \\land \\lnot [\\leq]\\varphi)\\) is no\nlonger possible. Instead, it can be easily shown how a belief in\ndefeasible knowledge, \\({B[\\leq]\\varphi}\\), is equivalent to a simple\nbelief, \\({B\\varphi}\\).\n",
