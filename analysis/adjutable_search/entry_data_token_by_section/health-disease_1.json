    "main_text": "Naturalism and Constructivism\n2. Naturalism and Constructivism\n\nThe tendency in recent philosophy has been to see disease concepts as\ninvolving empirical judgments about human physiology and normative\njudgments about human behavior or well-being (Bloomfield 2001, Boorse\n1975, Ereshefsky 2009, Culver and Gert 1982, Thagard 1999). First, we\nhave beliefs about the natural functioning of humans \u2013 both our\ncommon sense expectations about the body and scientific theories of\nhuman biology. Second, we make judgments about whether some particular\ncondition or way of life is or is not undesirable, in some relevant\nway. This second set of concerns obviously involves normative\ncriteria, to do with the extent to which a life is unnatural,\nundesirable or failing to flourish in some way. (There is not a clear\nconsensus among writers here.) One important and controversial\nquestion is whether the judgments we make concerning our biology are\nalso normative in some way. A further large question concerns the\nrelationship between the two types of judgments, in both medicine and\ncommon sense.\n\nAnother strain in recent scholarship suggests that our normative\njudgments alone determine who falls under the concepts of health and\ndisease. This view has been less influential in philosophy, but\ncommands widespread adherence in other areas of the humanities and\nsocial sciences (e.g. Kennedy 1983, Brown 1990). Kitcher (1997,\n208\u20139) summarizes the debate as follows:\n\nSome scholars, objectivists about disease, think that there are facts\nabout the human body on which the notion of disease is founded, and\nthat those with a clear grasp of those facts would have no trouble\ndrawing lines, even in the challenging cases. Their opponents,\nconstructivists about disease, maintain that this is an illusion, that\nthe disputed cases reveal how the values of different social groups\nconflict, rather than exposing any ignorance of facts, and that\nagreement is sometimes even produced because of universal acceptance\nof a system of values.\n\n\nKitcher\u2019s objectivism is nowadays more often called naturalism, and\nthat usage is followed here. The simple naturalist/constructivist\nopposition has also been complicated by more recent work and some of\nthose nuances will be introduced here. The next section starts with\nforms of constructivism and the difficulties they face. Then\nnaturalism will be similarly treated, before the discussion moves to\nhealth.\n\nKitcher\u2019s claim that an objectivist analysis, as he puts it, is\n\u201cgrounded\u201d on facts about the human body is perhaps not as\nclear as it might be. Before arriving at some qualifications, then, we\nshould have straightforward statements of naturalism and\nconstructivism in hand. (Although, since the qualifications are not\nyet in place, perhaps no theorist would fully endorse these bald\nversions of the positions.) There are also taxonomies that cut finer.\nBroadbent (2019, p.93) argues that naturalism and normativism are only\ntwo of the distinctions we need to inform the debate. He thinks of\nthem as \u201cdiagonal opposites on a 2\u00d72 matrix of possible\npositions, being Value-Independent Realism and Value-Dependent\nAnti-Realism respectively.\u201d Broadbent also recognizes\nValue-Dependent Realism and his own Value-Independent Anti-Realism.\nWhether or not constructivist analyses should really be seen as\nanti-realist in a metaphysical sense is not always clear, though. For\nreasons outlines below, the philosophical commitments of\nconstructivist views are sometimes hard to grasp.\n\nAt the bottom of the naturalist conception of disease (most\ninfluentially stated by Boorse (1975) and defended in Boorse (1997,\n2014) is that the human body comprises organ systems that have natural\nfunctions from which they can depart in many ways. Some of these\ndepartures from normal functioning are harmless or beneficial, but\nothers are not. The latter are \u2018diseases\u2019. So to call\nsomething a disease involves both a claim about the abnormal\nfunctioning of some bodily system and a judgment that the resulting\nabnormality is a bad one. Boorse uses\u2018illness\u2019 to describe\nthe concept of a disease that causes one\u2019s life to deteriorate. This\nlanguage is not universal, but the distinction between bodily\nmalfunction and normative judgement is widely used. Naturalists\ncontend that the determination of bodily malfunction is an objective\nmatter to be determined by science. They may also argue (Boorse 1997)\nthat determining whether a malfunction is detrimental to human\nwell-being is also an objective matter, but often they concede that\nnormative considerations are the basis for that judgment. So the\nnaturalist position is that a disease is a bodily malfunction that\ncauses one\u2019s well-being to lessen. This malfunction could take many\nforms: it is not a necessary part of the naturalist case that diseases\nconstitute a natural kind.\n\nRather, they could be a set of naturally occurring processes that are\nheld together in virtue of our interest in grouping them as a class.\nKinds that work like this include \u201cweed\u201d or\n\u201cvermin\u201d (Murphy 2006): the existence of the superordinate\nclass depends on human interests but the subordinate members are\nnatural kinds whose natures can be investigated scientifically.\n\nConstructivism, however, argues that human interests do not just\ndefine the superordinate class of diseases. It is human interests, not\nbiological malfunctions, that explain the judgments that subordinate\nmembers have the relevant biological character. Although\nconstructivists accept that disease categories refer to known or\nunknown biological processes they deny that these processes can be\nidentified independently of human values by, for example, a science of\nnormal human nature. Constructivist conceptions of disease are\nnormative through and through, although the precise account of the\nrelevant norms will vary between scholars. Analytically, it seems that\nconstructivism is distinct from the claim that disease is normative.\nHowever, constructivism and normativism do go together. One reason for\nthis often a professed skepticism about the existence of a\nnon-normative concept of malfunction. More broadly, constructivists\nmay think of disease labels as instruments of social control and\nreflections of biologically ungrounded reactions to human difference.\nThere may also exist, though this is less often brought to the fore,\nimportantly different stresses on the kinds of value judgements that\ndifferent theorists think are part of disease categories and their\napplication. Typically, the relevant normative claim is taken to apply\nto the life of the person whose health is under discussion \u2013 it is bad\nfor you to be that way. But in some contested cases the judgments are\noften held to be wider value-disvalue claims about society more\nbroadly \u2013 it is bad for us if you are that way. To make things even\nmore complicated, theorists will sometimes hold that the second type\nof judgement is what is really doing the work, but it masquerades as\nthe first type. Arguments about disease concepts, as we shall see, are\noften bound up with political and social controversies in which\ndiagnostic labels are impugned as instruments of oppression or social\ncontrol. \n\nThe key constructivist contention, as seen in the remark by Amundson\nquoted above, is that there is no natural, objectively definable set\nof human malfunctions that cause disease. Rather, constructivists\nassert that to call a condition a disease is to make a judgment that\nsomeone in that condition is undergoing a specific kind of harm that\nwe explain in terms of bodily processes. But the bodily processes are\nnot objectively malfunctioning; rather, they are merely judged by us\nto be unusual or abnormal because they depart from some shared,\nusually culturally specific, conception of human nature. The crucial\ndifference between the positions then is that for naturalists,\ndiseases are objectively malfunctioning biological processes that\ncause harms. For constructivists, diseases are harms that we blame on\nsome biological process because it causes the harm, not because it is\nobjectively dysfunctional.\n\nHowever, constructivism is hard to define satisfactorily, for two\nreasons. First, its core claim is a denial of the naturalist thesis\nthat disease necessarily involves bodily malfunction. Since there are\nmany views one might hold about the nature of the biological processes\ninvolved in disease that are compatible with the denial of\nmalfunction, the positive constructivist claim varies across theories\nand is often elusive. Reznek (1987) for example, explicitly denies\nthat malfunction is a necessary condition for disease. He does assert\n(ch 9) that diseases involve \u201cabnormal\u201d bodily processes,\nbut he does not say what that means. Constructivists often, as we will\nsee later, argue that disease judgments appeal to biological processes\nthat are to be understood in terms of human practices rather than\nmembership in some putatively biologically definable class of\nabnormalities or malfunctions. We have decided that some harmful\nconditions are the province of the medical profession, and those are\ndiseases.\n\nThat brings up the second reason why constructivism can be an elusive\ntarget: it has often rested on (perfectly reasonable) claims about the\nrole that value judgments have played in medical practice, or on the\nprevalence of culturally specific disagreements about abnormal human\nbehavior or physiology. This means, as we shall see, that\nconstructivists, especially in the social sciences, do not tend to\noffer necessary and sufficient conditions. Rather, they often seek to\nreconstruct the concept of disease as revealed by our practices.\nConstructivism, therefore, often looks like a thesis about how inquiry\nis carried on: first we identify a condition we disvalue, then we look\nfor a biological process that causes it and say that, whatever it is,\nit is abnormal. This stress on our practices is a common\nconstructivist trope, whereas objectivists more often seek to analyse\na concept that will clarify what disease really is, however fumbling\nand biased our attempts to uncover it may have been.\n\nThat both medical practice and lay thought shape disease concepts is\nundeniable. Because of this, we need to introduce a second\ndistinction. Both naturalism and constructivism can take either a\nrevisionist or a conservative form. A conservative view says that our\nfolk concept of illness should constrain a theoretical picture of\nhealth and disease worked out by scientists and clinicians. A\nrevisionist thinks that our existing concepts should be amended in the\nlight of what inquiry uncovers. One could be a conservative or\nrevisionist naturalist, as well as a conservative or revisionist\nconstructivist.\n\nHealth and disease, like many other concepts, are neither purely\nscientific nor exclusively a part of common sense. They have a home in\nboth scientific theories and everyday thought. That raises a problem\nfor any philosophical account: suppose we try to say what health and\ndisease really amount to, from which it follows that the scientific\nconcept should fit the facts about world. If the picture we end up\nwith deviates too far from folk thought, should we worry? You might\nthink that everyday language puts constraints on a concept of health\nthat need to respected, and that if we move too far from ordinary\nusage we have stopped talking about health and started talking about\nsomething else. Furthermore, it is not really possible to argue that\nscientific and vernacular uses of the concepts are fully independent,\nsince the development of science influences everyday thought, and many\nscientific concepts begin in pre-scientific contexts and carry the\nmarks of those origins deep into their careers.\n\nAlthough there is a thriving body of work that tries to analyse the\nconcept of disease \u2013 as we\u2019ll see in a moment \u2013 other\ntheorists dispute the prospects for a successful analysis of the\nconcept of disease. Schwartz (2007) contends that the biomedical\nsciences do not share a general concept of disease that is coherent\nenough to be analyzed. He recommends seeing the proposed analyses as\nintroducing new concepts of disease that are related to existing usage\nbut not bound by it. Concepts so introduced may work in some contexts\nbut not others, and different concepts of disease could be needed for\ndifferent medical purposes. Hesslow (1993) argues that diseases are\nnot interesting theoretical entities in medicine and are irrelevant to\nmost clinical decisions. These focus on how to improve a patient\u2019s\ncondition and do not need to depend on a judgment of disease.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of disease that is currently employed in most\nareas of medicine has undergone a process of development. For much of\nthe modern era there has been a dialectic between two concepts of\ndisease. On the one hand, there has been the idea that a disease is\njust an observable suite of symptoms with a predictable course\nunfolding. This notion dates back to Sydenham in the late seventeenth\ncentury. Kraepelin applied it to psychiatry as the basis for\ndifferential diagnosis, for example between subtypes of what was later\ncalled schizophrenia (1899, 173\u2013175). The approach was\nsupplanted as medicine matured by the concept of diseases as\ndestructive processes in bodily organs which \u201cdivert part of the\nsubstance of the individual from the actions which are natural to the\nspecies to another kind of action\u201d (Snow 1853, 155; for\ndiscussion see Whitbeck 1977, Carter 2003, Broome 2006). This is\nperhaps still the core medical conception of disease. It seeks\nexplanations that cite pathological processes in bodily systems. More\nrecent medicine has tended to weaken this slightly by adopting what\nGreen (2007, ch, 2) calls an \u2018actuarial\u2019 model of disease.\nThis model takes the presence of elevated risk, for example as\nindicated by high blood pressure, to be a disease even in the absence\nof overt symptoms or a clearly destructive pathological process (see\nalso Plutynski 2018, ch. 2).\n\nMedicine recognizes illnesses like hypertension and Cushing\u2019s disease\nthat are the outcome of systems in a poorly regulated state that is\nstable, albeit suboptimal. The idea of a specific pathogenic process\nin medicine includes dysregulation, but this may not accord with folk\nthought.\n\nModern medicine looks naturalistic about disease. One question, then,\nconcerns the extent to which common sense and biomedical concepts are\nrelated. Perhaps both have naturalist commitments, or perhaps common\nsense is driven by values and medicine is not, or perhaps physicians\nare really constructivists who are self-deceived or arguing in bad\nfaith.\n\nThere is little reason to expect scientific and common sense concepts\nto agree in general, so if medicine and everyday thought disagree\nabout disease, we may ask which concept should be adopted. If we wish\nto distil a concept that can play a role in medical inquiry, we may\nside with the scientists. But such proposals, which argue for a sharp\nseparation between scientific and folk uses, are not neutral pieces of\nobservation about the language. They are proposals for purging science\nfrom commonsense constraints that hinder its development. A\nrevisionist view of this sort, in this case, says that our concepts of\nhealth and disease might be a necessary starting point but should not\nconstrain where the inquiry ends up. Other forms of revisionism are\npossible. A revisionist naturalist argues that we should follow the\nscience where it takes us and come up with concepts that further\nscientific inquiry, for example, even if that means that we eventually\nuse the language in ways that look bizarre from the standpoint of\ncurrent common sense. But a revisionist constructivist could argue\nthat our thought, whether medical or lay, should be reformed in the\nservice of other goals, such as emancipation for hitherto oppressed\ngroups. Such revisionist thought was important in overturning the\npsychiatric view, dominant until the 1970s, that homosexuality is a\nmental illness. Activists argued that homosexuality was diagnosed for\noffensive moral reasons and not for medical ones and the\nclassification of homosexuality as a disease was changed as a result\nof lobbying on moral grounds rather than on the basis of any new\ndiscovery. Naturalists will respond that this was not an example of\nusing constructivism for emancipatory ends, but of bringing\npsychiatrists to understand that they were not obeying their own\nnaturalist principles about mental disorder, and showing them that\nthere was no good reason to retain the diagnosis. Much debate between\nnaturalists and constructivists involves competing histories in just\nthis way. Constructivists strive to uncover the role that moral and\nsocial values have always played in medical diagnosis and argue that\nour disease categories are hence not properly naturalistic.\nNaturalists, though they must concede that many diagnoses have been\nbased on moral values that we would now renounce, still insist that\nthe concept of disease, when correctly applied, as it often is, is\nthoroughly naturalistic and not impugned by past failures by the\nmedical profession to live up to its own scientific ambitions.\n\nNaturalists tend towards conceptual conservatism. They typically\nappeal to our intuitions about illness as support for their own\nemphasis on underlying bodily malfunction. This assumes that our\ncurrent concept is in good shape, that common sense and medicine share\na concept of disease, and that medicine should respect lay intuitions\nabout what is or is not a disease. Like many philosophers who think\nabout other concepts with both scientific and common sense uses,\nconservative naturalists about disease think that folk concepts\nspecify what counts as health and disease. The job of medicine is to\nlook at the world and see if anything in nature falls under the\nconcept as revealed by analysis (cf the \u201cCanberra plan\u201d of\nJackson 1998) For revisionists, this understanding of common sense in\nits relation to science is needlessly submissive to folk intuitions. A\nmore revisionist view takes the relevant concepts to be defined by\ntheir role in scientific theories \u2013 Boorse (1997) has argued\nthat disease is a term of art in pathology.\n\nRevisionist naturalists argue that facts about physiological and\npsychological functioning, like other biological facts, obtain\nindependently of human conceptions of the world. Our intuitions might\ntell us that a condition is not a disease. But scientific inquiry\nmight conclude that people with the condition are really suffering\nfrom a biological malfunction. In that case, a conservative would\nrecommend finessing the analysis to ensure that the concept of disease\ndoes not cover this case. A revisionist would say that we must bite\nthe bullet and judge that this case falls under the concept even if\nthat judgment is counterintuitive. A revisionist naturalist regards\nhealth and disease as features of the world to be discovered by\nbiomedical investigation, and therefore loosely constrained, at best,\nby our everyday concepts of health and disease. Lemoine (2013) argues\nthat conceptual analysis always involves a stipulative element\nconcerning controversial or borderline cases. Because contending\nparties will be led by their intuitions to see different stipulations\nas reasonable, conceptual analysis will be very unlikely to decide\nbetween competing analyses that are all reasonably successful at\ncapturing core cases. He suggests that instead philosophers should aim\nto naturalize disease by trying to first understand general features\nof theories in the medical sciences and then looking for perspicuous\nand coherent accounts of different disease types, with a view to\neventually establishing an overall picture of the role disease\nthinking plays in medicine. This approach treats diseases as putative\nnatural kinds and could be highly revisionist, while also leaving open\nthe possibility that some diagnoses represent contingent historical\noutcomes that have left us with an incoherent category. Fuller (2018)\nfollows Lemoine in dissenting from traditional conceptual analyses. He\nargues that we should try to work out what kinds of things diseases\nare rather than worrying about the concept. Fuller reviews the\nontological options and asks first about instances of disease \u2013\nwhat kinds of things are they? \u2013 rather than the concept, but,\nlooking at chronic disease, he goes \u2018bottom-up\u2019, by\nattempting to work out what instances of chronic disease have in\ncommon and making inductive generalizations about them. Fuller thinks\nof diseases \u2013 at least chronic ones but perhaps acute cases too\n\u2013 as dispositions (cf Hucklenbroich (2014). \n\nLange (2007) starts his account of disease from a similar impulse,\ninsisting that diseases play an absolutely essential role in\nexplaining a patient\u2019s symptoms. He argues that this explanatory role\nis characteristic of natural kinds elsewhere in science, and warrants\nthinking of diseases as natural kinds. Lange views diseases as natural\nkinds of incapacities. Stegenga (2018, ch.2.5), discussing Lange\u2019s\nurging that we dissolve broader disease categories in favour of\nfiner-grained biological descriptions, argues that we should see this\nas an eliminativist position, since it dispenses with the concept of\ndisease altogether and replaces it with diverse successor concepts.\nAny theory of disease could advocate for descriptions at finer grains,\nwhile retaining a broad category, as Stegenga says, for education and\npublic communication even if it has no real scientific application.\nThe extent to which we should see a theoretical reform as\neliminativist or merely very revisionist is hard to answer. In both\ncases we might secure an epistemic advance, but one might worry that\nour new vocabularies will deprive people of their ability to\nunderstand themselves by replacing a familiar vocabulary with a\nremote, scientific one tailored to the demands of experts. \n\nConstructivists are usually revisionists. They tend to say that\nconcepts of health and disease medicalize behavior that breaks norms\nor fails in some way to accord with our values; we don\u2019t like pain, so\npainful states count as diseases: we don\u2019t like fat people or drunks,\nso obesity and alcoholism count as diseases. Constructivists will\noften make this case with special vigor when it comes to mental\ndisorder. The critique of the concepts that guide disease applications\nis central to constructivism. \n\nConstructivists are often social scientists and their interests may\nnot map neatly on to philosophical concerns. They are not usually\ninterested in conceptual analysis so much as in tracing the social\nprocesses by which categories are formulated and changed over time.\nConrad (2007, 7\u20138), for example, says he is \u201cnot\ninterested in adjudicating whether any particular problem is really a\nmedical problem\u2026 I am interested in the social underpinnings of\nthis expansion of medical jurisdiction\u201d.\n\nBut constructivists often present their theories as unmasking common\nsense or medical conceptions of disease, and hence as a kind of\nrevisionism. They may accept that diagnoses of ill-health involve\nobjective facts that people appeal to, or presume that they can appeal\nto, when they say that somebody is sick. The assumption might be that\ngerms or other medically relevant causal factors are present in a\nperson and have given rise to visible phenomena that indicate\nill-health. But a constructivist will claim that the actual, often\nunacknowledged, judgments driving the initial assertion that someone\nis unhealthy are derived from social norms. We may discover facts\nabout obesity and its relationship to blood pressure or life\nexpectancy. But the constructivist says that our search for the\nrelevant biological findings is undertaken because we have already\ndecided that fat people are disgusting and we are trying to find a set\nof medically significant properties in order to make our wish to\nstigmatize them look like a medical decision rather than a moral or\naesthetic one. The crucial constructivist claim is that we look for\nthe biological facts that ground disease judgments selectively, based\non prior condemnations of some people and not others. Because they\nclaim that social norms rather than disinterested inquiry drive\nmedicine (and especially, psychiatry), constructivists tend to be\nrevisionists about folk concepts, seeking to bring to light the\nunacknowledged sources of our concepts of health and disease. But\nconstructivism could be a conservative view, aimed at uncovering our\nfolk theory of health and disease. A constructivist who takes this\nview says that our folk concept of disease is that of a pattern of\nbehavior or bodily activity that violates social norms. \n\nThe most philosophically sophisticated recent constructionist view is\nGlackin\u2019s (2019, p.260). He distinguishes the constitution question,\nwhich asks for the physical basis of a person\u2019s condition, from the\nstatus question, which asks what makes a physical configuration a\ndisease? This way of carving the terrain, and the importance of both\nstatus and constitution, is standard among most people who write about\ndisease. The distinctive feature of social construction, in\nGlackin\u2019s sense, is the priority of value judgements. Glackin\nuses the grounding relation to supply an answer to the problem of the\nrelation between constitution and status. That is, the frame for\ngrounding is fundamentally evaluative; the normative has a\nmetaphysical priority. As Glackin (p. 262) puts it, disease states are\ngrounded by the underlying biology or behaviour, but this grounding\nrelation exists in virtue of a set of normative facts that provide the\nframe (in the sense of Epstein 2015: a set of possible worlds that fix\nthe grounding conditions for social facts). \n\nOne could be a constructivist about some diseases, and a naturalist\nabout others. For example, one could be a naturalist about bodily\ndisease but a constructivist about psychiatry. Thomas Szasz (1960,\n1973, 1987), for instance, is usually read as a constructivist who\ndenies that mental illness exists. But in fact Szasz has a very strict\nobjectivist concept of disease as no more than damage to bodily\nstructures.\n\nSzasz argues that mental disorders cannot exist because they are not\nthe result of tissue damage. He is a naturalist about disease, which\nleads him to deny that mental illness is real and to offer a critical\nanalysis of our psychiatric practices. And indeed claims that we are\nmerely taking conduct we don\u2019t like and calling it pathological are\nmore plausible in psychiatry than in other parts of medicine, since\nthere is a long history of psychiatrists who have done just that.\nSamuel Cartwright argued in 1843 that American slaves who tried to\nescape were afflicted with \u201cdrapetomania\u201d or the\n\u201cdisease causing slaves to run away\u201d (Cartwright 2004,\n33); slaves were also found uniquely prone to \u201cdyesthaesia\nAethiopica\u201d, which made them neglect the property rights of\ntheir masters (Brown 1990). Nineteenth century physicians regularly\npracticed cliterodectomy to cure women of sexual desire, which\neverybody knew never afflicted normal females of good family (Reznek\n1987, 5\u20136). More recently, Soviet psychiatrists found that\npolitical dissidents suffered from \u201csluggish\nschizophrenia\u201d. And Horwitz and Wakefield (2007) have suggested\nthat depression has been severely overdiagnosed by recent generations\nof American psychiatrists, leading to the pathologizing of ordinary\nsadness.\n\nOur current taxonomy of illness could involve both naturalist\nintuitions about some conditions and constructivist rationalizations\nabout others. You could use this depiction of everyday thought as a\npremise in an argument for revisionism, on the grounds that our folk\nconcepts are too confused to serve as constraints (Murphy 2006 makes\nthis argument with respect to psychiatry).\n",
