    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in the History of Philosophy || Early Twentieth Century Discussions of Self-Consciousness\n1.4 Early Twentieth Century Discussions of Self-Consciousness\n\nIn the early twentieth century, Frege suggests a form of\nself-acquaintance, claiming that \u201ceveryone is presented to\nhimself in a special and primitive way\u201d (Frege 1918\u20131919:\n333). In a similar vein, in early work Russell (1910) favours the idea\nthat we are acquainted with ourselves, but by the 1920s (1921: 141) he\nseems to endorse a view more in line with Hume\u2019s sceptical\naccount. The same can be said of the Wittgenstein of the\nTractatus, who famously likens the self to the eye which sees\nbut does not see itself (Wittgenstein 1921: 5.6\u20135.641;\nO\u2019Brien 1996; Sullivan 1996). Husserl\u2019s philosophical\ndevelopment seems to have taken the opposite trajectory to that of\nRussell, with his (1900/1901, Investigation V, \u00a78) denial of the\ninner awareness of a \u201cpure ego\u201d being subsequently revised\ninto something resembling Kantian transcendental apperception (Husserl\n1913: \u00a757; Carr 1999: ch. 3; Zahavi 2005: ch. 2). Continuing with\nthe phenomenological tradition, Sartre (1937; Priest 2000) takes\nHusserl\u2019s later view to task, arguing against the view that we\nare continually aware of a transcendent ego, yet in favour of the\npicture of consciousness as involving a \u201cpre-reflective\u201d\nawareness of itself reminiscent of the Heidelberg School view (Wider\n1997: ch. 3; Miguens, Preyer, & Morando 2016). Questions about the\nnature of self-consciousness and, in particular, over whether there is\nan immediate, or intuitive, consciousness of the self, were as lively\nas ever well into the twentieth century.\n",
