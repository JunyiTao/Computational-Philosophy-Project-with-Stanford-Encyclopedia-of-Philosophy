    "main_text": "History of emotion in Christianity || Passions, affections, and emotions\n1.2 Passions, affections, and emotions\n\nIs \u2018emotion\u2019 the right term for the experiences under\nconsideration? In Thomas Dixon\u2019s well-known study (2003) of the\nhistory of the concept of emotion, he argues that the term\n\u2018emotion\u2019 was coined in the early 19th century, by\npsychologists impressed with physics, as a secular replacement for the\nmorally, religiously, and metaphysically freighted distinction between\n\u2018passion\u2019 and \u2018affection.\u2019 In the older\nChristian psychology (which still had distinguished representatives in\nthe late 19th century), the phenomena that we call emotions were\ncalled passions and affections, these two categories being\ndistinguished from one another. Aquinas is a paradigm thinker in this\npsychology of \u201cemotions.\u201d Passions (passiones)\nare feeling-responses such as humans share with animals, responses to\nbodily and sensory occurrences (e.g. sense perceptions of danger, of\nfood, of sexual opportunity). They are marked by visceral commotion\nand are associated with moral temptation or turpitude. Affections\n(affectiones), by contrast, are generated not in the sensory\nappetite, but in the will or intellectual appetite, a psychological\ncapacity peculiar to human beings. Human beings share\naffectiones not with the animals, but with higher beings such\nas angels and God. Passions, however, are not always sinful, and a\npassion can be transformed into an affection if the person feeling it\nendorses it by an act of the will or intellectual appetite. Dixon\nargues that \u2018emotion\u2019 was coined by physiological\npsychologists Thomas Brown, Herbert Spencer, and Alexander Bain. It\nwas later adopted by William James (1884), though his work on\nreligious experience (1901\u201302) was more phenomenological and less\nfocused on physical causation. In \u201cWhat Is An Emotion\u201d\n(1884) James famously proposed that an emotion is just an awareness of\na bodily perturbation that is directly produced by objects (for\nexample, a large bear advancing toward you on a lonely path). In\npsychology even today \u2018emotion\u2019 tends to have this\nphysicalist connotation and is less discriminating than the earlier\nvocabulary of passions and affections, with its openness to spiritual\n\u201cemotions.\u201d Rather than call the briefly sketched biblical\nresponses of joy and so forth emotions, would it not be more\ndiscriminating and less confusing to follow the earlier Christian\nvocabulary and call them affections? If gratitude can succeed, as\nreligious people think it can, in being to God, and if Paul\u2019s joy can\nbe about the moral status of the Corinthians\u2019 remorse, then they\nseem clearly not to be simple responses to physical or\nsensory stimuli. Indeed, most human emotions fail to\nqualify as emotions in the original historical sense of the word. The\nkind that does plausibly qualify \u2014 \u201cthe startle response\u201d\n(see Robinson 1995) \u2014 is only controversially an emotion in\nour ordinary sense of the word. Our ordinary sense is very far from\nits historical origin as Dixon has traced it. Dixon is right that\n\u2018emotion\u2019 blurs the distinction that \u2018passion\u2019\nand \u2018affection\u2019 once embodied. But arguably that\ndistinction is well lost. Fears marked by strong physiological\ncommotion can be evoked by objects inaccessible to animals without an\nintellect, for example, a fall in the stock market. And it seems to\ntake more than the mere sensory \u201cstimulus\u201d of a large bear\ncoming toward me on a lonely path to arouse fear. For example, I may\nrecognize her as my pet, and her rapid advance as her enthusiasm in\ngreeting me. Nor is the moral dividing line between passions and\naffections valid. Passions may be morally beautiful (for example, a\nwoman\u2019s erotically tinged joy upon seeing her husband after an\nabsence) and affections despicable (the cool cruel joy of humiliating\na colleague as you dismantle his pet argument). The very indifference\nof the concept of emotion to whether the object is simple or\nintellectually complex, sensory or not, whether accompanied or not by\nbodily perturbations, and whether it merits moral evaluation or not,\nseems to recommend it in preference to the older vocabulary.\nGratitude, contrition, compassion, joy, hope, and all the other\nreligious emotions fit quite commodiously in the category of\nemotion.\n",
