    "main_text": "Programs\n4. Programs\n\nThe ontology of computer programs is strictly related to the subsumed\nnature of computational systems (see\n \u00a71).\n If computational systems are defined on the basis of the\nsoftware-hardware dichotomy, programs are abstract entities\ninterpreting the former and opposed to the concrete nature of\nhardware. Examples of such interpretations are provided in\n \u00a71.1\n and include the \u201cconcrete abstraction\u201d definition by\nColburn (2000), the \u201cabstract artifact\u201d characterization\nby Irmak (2012), and programs as specifications of machines proposed\nby Duncan (2011). By contrast, under the interpretation of\ncomputational systems by a hierarchy of LoAs, programs are\nimplementations of algorithms. We refer to\n \u00a75\n on implementation for an analysis of the ontology of programs in this\nsense. This section focuses on definitions of programs with a\nsignificant relevance in the literature, namely those views that\nconsider programs as theories or as artifacts, with a focus on the\nproblem of the relation between programs and the world.\n",
