    "main_text": "Further Issues || Gender Justice\n8.5 Gender Justice\n\nOne topic that has recently received renewed attention in the\nliterature on public reason concerns the extent to which the idea of\npublic reason is compatible with a robust commitment to political\nprinciples of gender equality and gender justice. Skeptics have long\nworried that the aspiration to justify political principles to all\nreasonable persons would constrain the pursuit of gender justice. Many\nif not most of the largest religions in the world endorse\ninegalitarian ideals regarding the roles of men and women. If the\nconstituency of public reason includes persons who endorse such\nreligious doctrines, then it might seem strongly egalitarian\nprinciples of gender justice will not be publicly justifiable (Okin\n1994; Okin 2004).\n\nA number of scholars, however, have argued that more robust principles\nof gender justice can be derived from within the framework of liberal\npublic reason (Baehr 2008; Chambers 2018, 48\u201355; Hartley and Watson\n2010; Lloyd 1998; Neufeld and Van Schoelandt 2014; Schouten 2013;\nSchouten 2017; Schouten 2019; Watson and Hartley 2018). These\narguments are developed in different ways, but they generally converge\non the thesis that shared public political values provide a sufficient\nbasis to publicly justify a range of policies designed to mitigate or\neliminate gender-based inequalities.\n8.6 Perspectival Diversity, Anti-Sectarianism, and Perfectionism\n\nA different topic that has only recently begun to receive sustained\nattention concerns perspectival diversity. Theories of public reason\nare explicitly designed to address the fact of reasonable pluralism or\ndisagreement, but the disagreement is often assumed to be only about\nnormative or ethical matters. But persons\u2019 diverse perspectives\ncan also lead to disagreement regarding how to categorize or describe\nthe world. Different parties to a dispute might all agree, for\nexample, that gratuitous harm is wrong, but disagree about whether\nhate speech constitutes harm, or disagree about whether certain\ncreatures are capable of suffering harm. Without a shared account of\nthe world, it might seem the project of public reason faces grave\ndifficulties. Even if certain moral or political rules can be publicly\njustified, our understanding and application of these rules might\nradically diverge given sufficient perspectival diversity regarding\nwhat the world looks like. Gerald Gaus and Ryan Muldoon confront this\nchallenge for theories of public reason in recent work (Gaus 2016;\nGaus 2017; Muldoon 2016). Both suggest that perspectival diversity is\nnot necessarily an obstacle to be overcome, but can also deliver\nimportant epistemic benefits. But both also suggest existing accounts\nof public reason, which often emphasize the importance of persons or\ncitizens sharing a common perspective, are ill-suited to realizing\nthese benefits.\n\nIn a closely related vein some argue that, other things being\nequal, theories of public reason that include a wider diversity of\nviewpoints in the constituency of justification are preferable to\nthose that include a narrower set of views in the justificatory\nconstituency. This idea is sometimes referred to as anti-sectarianism,\nand it has been advanced as a desideratum that speaks in favor of\nconvergence models of public reason and against at least some\nconsensus models (Gaus 2012; Vallier 2017; Vallier and\nMuldoon 2021). But for criticism of anti-sectariarianism as a\ndesideratum see (Quong 2012, 51\u201358; Tahzib 2021). \n\nThe debate over anti-sectarianism also bears on the question of\nwhether, and to what extent, theories of public reason are compatible\nwith perfectionism in political morality. Perfectionists hold that\npolitical power may legitimately be used by appeal to claims about the\nintrinsic or inherent value of certain activities of ways of life\n(Wall 2021). It has been widely assumed that perfectionism is\nincompatible with the idea of public reason since the constituency of\npersons to whom exercises of political power must be justified can be\nassumed to disagree in deep and permanent ways about matters of the\ngood life. This widespread assumption has recently been challenged,\nhowever (Kim 2016; Tahzib 2019.  Also see Chan 2000).\nThese authors suggest that the constituency of justification can and\nshould be idealized to incorporate certain ideas about the good life.\nWhether, and to what extent, this reconciliation of public reason and\nperfectionism is plausible depends in part on one\u2019s views about\nanti-sectarianism as a desideratum.
