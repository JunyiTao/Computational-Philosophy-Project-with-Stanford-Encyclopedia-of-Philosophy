    "main_text": "The Two Faces of Morality: Values and Duties\n1. The Two Faces of Morality: Values and Duties\n\nMoral discourse is normative in nature, that is, concerned with\nguiding behavior rather than describing the world. But this normative\ncharacter of moral judgment falls broadly speaking under two\ncategories, the axiological and the deontic. The former refers to\ngoodness, ideals and virtues; the latter to what ought to be done, to\nduties and obligations, to justice and rights. Whereas the object of\naxiological assessment is primarily states of affairs and human\nagents, the object of deontic evaluation is human actions. For\ninstance, the state of affairs of a world with no war is a moral ideal\nand the individual Socrates is virtuous, whereas the practice of\npaying back debts is obligatory and acts of theft prohibited.\n\nThe axiological face of morality, unlike its deontic counterpart, is\nopen-ended. Virtuous character traits, ethical ideals, or the goal of\npromoting human happiness have no fixed measure and can in principle\nbe always improved and further perfected or realized. Moral\nrequirements are relatively fixed and well defined, having clear\ncriteria of fulfillment and violation. Consequently, the deontic\nsphere of morality is often taken as describing the minimal\nconditions of morality, the basic requirements of social morality that\nsecure a just society, while the axiological sphere aims at higher\nideals which can only be commended and recommended but not strictly\nrequired. In its deontic nature, morality is closely associated with\nthe legal, while the axiological is closer to the ideal or the\nideological (sometimes referred to as \u201cthe ethical\u201d).\nFurthermore, the way in which deontic norms are fixed and universally\nexpected of all members of society presupposes the general\nability of all moral agents to act in the light of these\nnorms. Ideals of goodness and virtue, in their open-ended texture,\ncannot be similarly expected of everyone and their determination is\nnot subjected to the strict condition of \u201c\u2018ought\u2019\nimplies \u2018can\u2019.\u201d\n\nMost ethical theories maintain some form of this two-tier structure of\nthe moral system, although admittedly in different versions and\nemphases. But this double role of normative discourse inevitably\nraises the idea of supererogation, the category of actions that are\npraiseworthy (either in creating good states of affairs or in\nreflecting a particularly virtuous trait of character) yet at the same\ntime not obligatory. Supererogation lies at the intersection of the\naxiological and the deontic, the \u2018good\u2019 and the\n\u2018ought\u2019. Since moral theories of the past (like Aristotle,\nKant and utilitarianism) all appeal in some form to both deontic and\naxiological concepts, the scant and cursory discussion of\nsupererogation in those theories is all the more surprising.\n\nThe most notable exception to this historical generalization is the\nlong-standing and elaborate Roman Catholic doctrine of opera\nsupererogationis. The general background of this doctrine is the\nrecognition of the two faces of morality under the concepts of\n\u201cprecepts\u201d and \u201ccounsels.\u201d The origins of this\ndistinction go back to the New Testament, in which to the question\nwhat one should do to gain eternal life, Jesus replies: \u201cif thou\nwilt enter into life, keep the commandments,\u201d but adds \u201cif\nthou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast and give to the poor and\nthou shalt have treasure in Heaven\u201d (Matthew xix, 16\u201324).\nBeyond charity, the Church Fathers detected in the New Testament two\nadditional evangelical counsels, chastity and obedience: taking a wife\nis no sin, but virginity has a superior value; the life of an ordinary\nChristian cannot be blamed, but that of absolute monastic dedication\nis far better. Forgiveness and love of one\u2019s enemies are also\nreligious ideals that originate in the New Testament and were\nsometimes given a supererogatory interpretation in later Church\ndoctrine.\n\nThe Old Law of the Old Testament is regarded by early Catholic\nthinkers as reflecting the rigid and minimal demands of religious\nmorality, typically formulated in the negative terms of prohibitions\nand precepts (the violation of which entails punishment). The New Law,\nthat of the New Testament, sometimes called the Law of Liberty, leaves\nthe individual free to pursue more edifying ideals of perfection.\nTertullian called this freedom licentia. According to the\nCatholic doctrine, the special merit of supererogatory acts accredited\nto their agent can be used both for that individual\u2019s own\nsalvation and for the salvation of others. The \u201csuperabundant\nmerit,\u201d most typically collected by the actions of Jesus and the\nsaints, who far exceeded what was required for their own salvation, is\ndeposited in the Spiritual Treasury of the Church to be disposed by\nthe Pope and the bishops for remitting the sins of other, ordinary\nbelievers. This is how the institution of Indulgences gradually\ndeveloped in the late middle ages: sinners could buy the remission of\ntheir sins, first by joining the Crusades and later by contributing\nmoney to the coffers of the Church.\n\nThe most articulate exposition of the doctrine of supererogation in\nthe Christian tradition is found in Thomas Aquinas (Summa\nTheologica). Thomas mentions two distinct sources of merit of\nsupererogatory behavior. On the one hand supererogation serves as a\nmore expedient or guaranteed way of achieving everlasting life; on the\nother, it is intrinsically good in being aimed at higher ends than the\nmere fulfillment of the commandments. Precepts are universal in their\nscope, whereas counsels are addressed to the few who have the capacity\nand inclination to pursue the life of perfection. For Thomas, the\nopen-texture character of the counsels of supererogation is what makes\nthe morality of love superior to the authoritarian nature of the\nstrict law. But Thomas does not draw a clear borderline between duty\nand supererogation. It is, for example, not clear whether \u201clove\nthy enemy\u201d is a precept or a supererogatory counsel. It is\nsimilarly unclear whether beneficence (almsgiving) is a duty or lies\nbeyond duty. Nor is the role of virtue in demarcating the\nsupererogatory from the obligatory explained. Thomas says that both\nnatural law and positive law prescribe acts of virtue in general but\nthey do not prescribe every specific virtuous act (except for those\nthat promote the social good of justice and peace). And as for divine\nlaw, it prescribes also other, non-social actions that belong to the\nrelations between man and God but leaves those actions of perfect\nvirtue to the realm of supererogatory counsel.\n\nThe Catholic doctrine of supererogation met with an extremely fierce\nopposition in the times of the Reformation. Luther, Calvin and\nAnglican theologians attacked both the theory of\n\u201csuper-meritorious\u201d actions and the corruption involved in\nthe commercialization of the institution of indulgences for which the\ntheory served as a cover. No human being, not even a saint, can do all\nthat is strictly required as a duty, let alone hope to go beyond that.\nThe way to salvation is not through \u201cworks\u201d but through\ndivine grace alone (Luther 1957). Even the most dramatic acts of\nmartyrdom and self-sacrifice, which served the Catholics as paradigm\nexamples of supererogation, are strictly speaking obligatory.\nProtestant ethics thus undermines the distinction between the two\nfaces of morality: on the one hand, normative requirements cannot be\ndefined in terms of rules fixing minimally prescribed behavior; on the\nother hand, every religiously good behavior is obligatory. Saints and\nsinners are equally dependent on God\u2019s grace for their\nsalvation. Paradoxically, it may be noted, exactly because human\nactions can never fulfill God\u2019s commandments, divine grace is\nnever due or ethically called for: it is typically\nsupererogatory, a free gift of God!\n\nAn interesting parallel to the Christian concept of supererogation can\nbe found in Jewish thought in the notion of \u201clifnim mishurat\nhadin\u201d. Typically, the rabbis dispute its philosophical meaning\nsince it could be literally understood as either \u201cwithin the\nline of law\u201d or \u2014 as it is more often understood \u2014\n\u201cbeyond the line of law\u201d. Some philosophers (like\nNahmanides) follow the former reading, arguing that moral acts of\npiety or charity are obligatory, that is to say duties that apply to\neverybody. Others (notably Maimonides) adhere to the latter, more\nsupererogatory understanding, holding that such acts are either\nobligatory only for the \u201cpious\u201d few or even not obligatory\nfor anyone (Shilo 1978). This debate regarding the possibility of\nsupererogatory acts reflects the deep underlying problem of the whole\nnormative discourse in Jewish thought, namely is there an independent\nsystem of moral norms and ideals which is not directly derived from\nthe Halakhic, commandment-based, legally binding (and enforceable) law\n(Lichtenstein 1975).\n\nThe hostile attitude of the Reformation to supererogation and the\ndisappearance of the institution of indulgences in the Catholic Church\nled to the rapid decline in the theological and philosophical interest\nin the concept of supererogation in the modern era. However, the great\ntheological debates about actions beyond the call of duty set the\nstage for the contemporary discussion of the subject. The revived\ninterest in supererogation since the 1960s has completely shifted the\nfocus from the theological context to the ethical, but the structure\nof the argumentation is often reminiscent of the traditional Christian\ndebate.\n",
