    "main_text": "Quantum Properties || Example of spin half\n2.3 Example of spin half\nLet us apply these ideas to a specific example, that of the spin\ndegree of freedom of a spin-half particle, such as an electron or a\nproton, or a silver atom in its electronic ground state. The operator\n\\(S_z\\) for the \\(z\\) component of spin angular momentum acts on a\n2-dimensional Hilbert space and has eigenvalues \\(+1/2\\) and \\(-1/2\\) in\nunits of \\(\\hbar\\). If \\(\\ket{z^+}\\) and \\(\\ket{z^-}\\) are the corresponding\neigenkets, the projectors corresponding to \\(S_z=\\pm 1/2\\) are \\([z^+]\n=\\dya{z^+}\\) and \\([z^-] =\\dya{z^-}\\). The product of these projectors in\neither order is the zero operator \\(0\\), which is the property that is\nalways false, the quantum counterpart of the empty subset of a\nclassical phase space. Their sum \\([z^+] + [z^-] =I\\) is the identity\noperator, the property that is always true. In physical terms, \\(S_z\\)\nis either positive or negative: it cannot be both (\\([z^+]\\cdot [z^-]\n=0\\)), and it must be one or the other (\\([z^+] + [z^-] =I\\)). This\nexplains the outcome of the Stern-Gerlach experiment.\nIn the same way the \\(x\\) component \\(S_x\\) of angular momentum can\ntake only two values \\(+1/2\\) or \\(-1/2\\), corresponding to the projectors\n\\([x^+] = \\dya{x^+}\\) and \\([x^-] = \\dya{x^-}\\) formed from its eigenkets\n\\(\\ket{x^+}\\) and \\(\\ket{x^-}\\). Consequently, what was stated in the\nprevious paragraph about \\(S_z\\) can also be said about\n\\(S_x\\). However\u2014here we arrive at a central feature of the\nhistories interpretation\u2014it is not meaningful\nto combine discussions of \\(S_z\\) with discussions of \\(S_x\\),\nbecause neither \\([x^+]\\) nor \\([x^-]\\) commutes with \\([z^+]\\) or\n\\([z^-]\\). There is no way of associating the property \u201c\\(S_z=+1/2\\)\nAND \\(S_x=+1/2\\)\u201d with a subspace of the two-dimensional quantum\nHilbert space. One way to see this is that every one-dimensional\nsubspace of this Hilbert space has a physical interpretation:\n\\(S_w=+1/2\\) for some direction \\(w\\) in space, so there are no\npossibilities left over which could correspond to \u201c\\(S_z=+1/2\\)\nAND \\(S_x=+1/2\\)\u201d. But might one assign the zero-dimensional\nsubspace, the proposition that is always false, to \u201c\\(S_z=+1/2\\)\nAND \\(S_x=+1/2\\)\u201d? This is the approach of quantum logic. However,\ntaking the negation of this proposition that is always false has the\nconsequence that the proposition \u201c\\(S_z=-1/2\\) OR\n\\(S_x=-1/2\\)\u201d is always true, which to a physicist seems\nextremely odd. See the\n Further Reading supplement\nfor more details.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the logic associated with the\nhistories approach, see (Griffiths\n2014).\n",
