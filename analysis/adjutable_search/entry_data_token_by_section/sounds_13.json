    "main_text": "Aspatial Theories || Aspatial Auditory Perception\n4.2 Aspatial Auditory Perception\n\nIt is possible to argue that auditory perception is not intrinsically\nspatial independently of a commitment to the claim that sounds do not\nhave spatial locations. This is O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s view, who\nwrites that \n\n\nwhile we have the auditory experience of hearing that a sound comes\nfrom p, we do not have any experience that it is here where it now\nsounds\u2026And this is so for a very interesting reason: namely,\nthat we absolutely never immediately perceive sounds to be at any\nplace. (2000: 446) \n\n\nHowever, O\u2019Shaughnessy does not draw the conclusion that sounds\nhave no spatial locations. On the contrary, as we have seen, he\ndefends a proximal account of the location of sounds, according to\nwhich sounds are where hearers, rather than sources, are (2009).\n\nO\u2019Shaughnessy would not be impressed by allegedly\nphenomenological arguments according to which one normally hears\nsounds as located at their sources. One may still have the feeling\nthat his sophisticated version of proximal theories does not locate\nsounds where an untutored description of what is perceived suggests\nthey are. As a consequence, it appears to be another massive error\ntheory of auditory perception.\n",
