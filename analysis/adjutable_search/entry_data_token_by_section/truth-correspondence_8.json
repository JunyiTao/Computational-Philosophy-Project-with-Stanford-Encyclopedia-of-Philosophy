    "main_text": "Objections to the Correspondence Theory\n5. Objections to the Correspondence Theory\n\nObjection 1: Definitions like (1) or (2) are\ntoo narrow. Although they apply to truths from some domains of\ndiscourse, e.g., the domain of science, they fail for others, e.g.\nthe domain of morality: there are no moral facts.\n\n\nThe objection recognizes moral truths, but rejects the idea that\nreality contains moral facts for moral truths to correspond to. Logic\nprovides another example of a domain that has been\n\u201cflagged\u201d in this way. The logical positivists recognized\nlogical truths but rejected logical facts. Their intellectual\nancestor, Hume, had already given two definitions of\n\u201ctrue\u201d, one for logical truths, broadly conceived, the\nother for non-logical truths: \u201cTruth or falsehood consists in an\nagreement or disagreement either to the real relations of\nideas, or to real existence and matter of fact\u201d\n(Hume, Treatise, 3.1.1, cf. 2.3.10; see also\nLocke, Essay, 4.5.6, for a similarly two-pronged account but\nin terms of object-based correspondence).\n\n\nThere are four possible responses to objections of this sort:\n(a) Noncognitivism, which says that, despite appearances to\nthe contrary, claims from the flagged domain are not truth-evaluable\nto begin with, e.g., moral claims are commands or expressions of\nemotions disguised as truthbearers; (b) Error theory, which\nsays that all claims from the flagged domain are false; (c)\nReductionism, which says that truths from the flagged domain\ncorrespond to facts of a different domain regarded as unproblematic,\ne.g., moral truths correspond to social-behavioral facts, logical\ntruths correspond to facts about linguistic conventions; and\n(d) Standing firm, i.e., embracing facts of the flagged\ndomain.\n\n\nThe objection in effect maintains that there are different brands\nof truth (of the property being true, not just\ndifferent brands of truths) for different domains. On the face of it,\nthis conflicts with the observation that there are many obviously\nvalid arguments combining premises from flagged and unflagged\ndomains. The observation is widely regarded as refuting\nnon-cognitivism, once the most popular (concessive) response to the\nobjection.\n\n\nIn connection with this objection, one should take note of the\nrecently developed \u201cmultiple realizability\u201d view of truth,\naccording to which truth is not to be identified\nwith correspondence to fact but can be realized by\ncorrespondence to fact for truthbearers of some domains of discourse\nand by other properties for truthbearers of other domains of\ndiscourse, including \u201cflagged\u201d domains. Though it retains\nimportant elements of the correspondence theory, this view does not,\nstrictly speaking, offer a response to the objection on behalf of the\ncorrespondence theory and should be regarded as one of its competitors\n(see below, Section 8.2).\n\nObjection 2: Correspondence theories are too\nobvious. They are trivial, vacuous, trading in mere platitudes.\nLocutions from the \u201ccorresponds to the facts\u201d-family are\nused regularly in everyday language as idiomatic substitutes for\n\u201ctrue\u201d. Such common turns of phrase should not be taken to\nindicate commitment to a correspondence theory in any serious\nsense. Definitions like (1) or (2) merely condense some trivial idioms\ninto handy formulas; they don\u2019t deserve the grand label\n\u201ctheory\u201d: there is no theoretical weight behind them\n(cf. Woozley 1949, chap. 6; Davidson 1969; Blackburn 1984,\nchap. 7.1).\n\n\nIn response, one could point out: (a) Definitions like (1) or\n(2) are \u201cmini-theories\u201d\u2014mini-theories are quite\ncommon in philosophy\u2014and it is not at all obvious that they are\nvacuous merely because they are modeled on common usage. (b)\nThere are correspondence theories that go beyond these\ndefinitions. (c) The complaint implies that definitions like\n(1) and/or (2) are generally accepted and are, moreover, so shallow\nthat they are compatible with any deeper theory of truth.  This makes\nit rather difficult to explain why some thinkers emphatically reject\nall correspondence formulations. (d) The objection implies\nthat the correspondence of S\u2019s belief with a fact could\nbe said to consist in, e.g., the belief\u2019s coherence\nwith S\u2019s overall belief system. This is wildly\nimplausible, even on the most shallow understanding of\n\u201ccorrespondence\u201d and \u201cfact\u201d.\n\nObjection 3: Correspondence theories are\ntoo obscure.\n\n\nObjections of this sort, which are the most common, protest that the\ncentral notions of a correspondence theory carry unacceptable\ncommitments and/or cannot be accounted for in any respectable manner.\nThe objections can be divided into objections primarily aimed at the\ncorrespondence relation and its relatives (3.C1, 3.C2), and\nobjections primarily aimed at the notions of fact\nor state of affairs (3.F1, 3.F2):\n\n3.C1: The correspondence relation must be\nsome sort of resemblance relation. But truthbearers do not resemble\nanything in the world except other truthbearers\u2014echoing\nBerkeley\u2019s \u201can idea can be like nothing but an\nidea\u201d.\n\n3.C2: The correspondence relation is very\nmysterious: it seems to reach into the most distant regions of space\n(faster than light?) and time (past and future). How could such a\nrelation possibly be accounted for within a naturalistic framework?\nWhat physical relation could it possibly be?\n\n3.F1: Given the great variety of complex\ntruthbearers, a correspondence theory will be committed to all sorts\nof complex \u201cfunny facts\u201d that are ontologically\ndisreputable. Negative, disjunctive, conditional, universal,\nprobabilistic, subjunctive, and counterfactual facts have all given\ncause for complaint on this score.\n\n3.F2: All facts, even the most simple ones,\nare disreputable.  Fact-talk, being wedded to that-clauses, is\nentirely parasitic on truth-talk. Facts are too much like\ntruthbearers. Facts are fictions, spurious sentence-like slices of\nreality, \u201cprojected from true sentences for the sake of\ncorrespondence\u201d (Quine 1987, p. 213; cf.  Strawson 1950).\n",
