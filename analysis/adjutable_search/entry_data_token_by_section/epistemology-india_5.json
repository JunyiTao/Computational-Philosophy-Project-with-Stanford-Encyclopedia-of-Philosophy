    "main_text": "Knowing That You Know\n3. Knowing That You Know\n\n\nOne of the philosophic problems that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna raised for\nepistemology has to do with an alleged regress of justification on the\nassumption that a pram\u0101\u1e47a is\nrequired in order to know and that to identify the source of a bit of\nknowledge is to certify the proposition embedded. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\nclaims that this is absurd in that it would require an infinite series\nof pram\u0101\u1e47a, of identification of a\nmore fundamental pram\u0101\u1e47a for every\npram\u0101\u1e47a relied on.\n\n\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Ved\u0101nta\nphilosophers argue that such a threat of regress shows that knowledge\nis self-certifying, svata\u1e25\npr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya. Ved\u0101ntins connect\nthe Upanishadic teaching of a truest or deepest self\n(\u0101tman) as having \u201cself-illumining awareness\u201d\n(sva-prak\u0101\u015ba) with a\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 epistemological theory\nof self-certification: at least in the case of spiritual knowledge\n(vidy\u0101) awareness is self-aware. From this it follows\nthat only awareness is right concerning all questions about awareness,\nsince only awareness itself has, so to say, access to itself. Awareness\nitself is the only consideration relevant to any question about\nawareness itself, its existence or its nature.\n\n\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 defends Vedic truth\nby claiming that knowledge of it wears its certification on its sleeve\nlike everyday knowledge where the initial credibility of an occurrent\ncognition seems practically absolute. According to Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (from the late seventh\ncentury), no cognition that in itself purports to be veridical is\nindeed non-veridical; no cognition is absolutely wrong but at worst a\nconfusion. The same causal nexus that produces a veridical cognition\nproduces knowledge of its veridicality. According to\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (deriving from\nKum\u0101rila, Prabh\u0101kara\u2019s teacher), veridicality is known\nthrough the process of inference whereby a cognition itself would be\nknown as having occurred. A cognition, which is an act, produces a\nfeature in the object it cognizes, a \u201ccognizedness,\u201d and then from\napprehension of this feature both the original cognition and its\nveridicality are known. Certification is thus intrinsic to a\ncognition\u2019s being known, that is, with cognitions that are veridical.\nWith respect to knowledge of non-veridicality, extrinsic certification\nis necessary.\n\n\nNy\u0101ya takes an extrinsicality view of certification\n(parata\u1e25\npr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya)\u2014it denies that\nKp entails KKp; to know that you know requires\napperceptive certification\u2014and so seems vulnerable to the regress\ncharge. The solution involves the notion of \u201capperception\u201d\n(anuvyavas\u0101ya), which is a second-level cognition that\nhas another cognition as its object without\nitself being self-aware. Certification, psychologically considered,\ninvolves apperception, a seeing that a challenged, target cognition is\nfalse or true.\n\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana (fourth century, whose\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra commentary is the oldest extant)\nexpressly rebuts the regress charge (we do sometimes certify our claims\nwithout having to certify the certifiers) under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 2.1.20 (448\u201349, translation\nmine):\n\n\nIf comprehension of perception or another (knowledge source) landed us\nin infinite regress, then everyday action and discourse would not go\non through comprehension of self-consciously known objects and their\nknown causes. (However) everyday action and discourse do proceed for\nsomeone comprehending self-consciously known objects and their known\ncauses: when (self-consciously) I grasp by perception an object or I\ngrasp one by inference or I grasp one by analogy or I grasp one by\ntradition or testimony (the four knowledge sources according to\nNy\u0101ya), the (apperceptive) cognition that occurs goes like this:\n\u201cMy knowledge is perceptual\u201d or \u201cMy knowledge is\ninferential\u201d or \u201cMy knowledge is from analogy\u201d or\n\u201cMy knowledge is testimonial.\u201d\n\nAnd motivation to seek righteousness (dharma), wealth,\npleasure, or liberation proceeds through these comprehensions (whereas\nif there is doubt, no such goal-directed activity would occur), as\nlikewise motivation to reject their opposites. Everyday discourse and\naction would cease (to be possible for such a subject) if what is\nalleged were indeed to hold (justificational regress).\n\n\nNy\u0101ya\u2019s strategy is then (1) to charge the objector with making a\n\u201cpragmatic contradiction,\u201d (2) to take veridicality as cognitive\ndefault, and (3) to certify cognitions by source identification as well\nas by inference from the success or failure of the activity that they\nprovoke and guide. We assume without checking that our cognition is\nveridical, but sometimes we need to check. Note that the practical\npursuits that V\u0101tsy\u0101yana mentions as guided by second-order,\nreflective knowledge are: \u201crighteousness (dharma), wealth,\npleasure, [and] liberation.\u201d\n\n",
