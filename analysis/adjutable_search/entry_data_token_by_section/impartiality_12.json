M.C. Henberg, for instance, claims that most if not all\nprocedural accounts of impartiality confuse it with disinterest or\nimpersonality, and thus, ultimately, with indifference. (It should be\nnoted that many impartialists are quite explicit about the link\nbetween morality, impartiality, and the lack of emotion; Baier (1958),\nfor instance, writes that \u201cthe moral point of view [is] that of\nan independent, unbiased, impartial, objective, dispassionate,\ndisinterested observer\u201d (201; see also Firth 1952).) Similarly,\nRichard Brandt argues that it is a mistake to define moral\nimpartiality with reference to an ideal observer who is defined as\n(among other things) disinterested; for after all, \u201cit is not\nclear that a purely disinterested being would support a moral system\nat all\u201d (Brandt 1979, 227). While Brandt\u2019s complaint is\nparticularly directed at the ideal observer theory of (Firth 1952),\nthis objection seems to apply much more broadly; it is obvious, for\ninstance, that Rawls\u2019s veil of ignorance is designed precisely\nto prevent the contractors from acting in an interested manner.\n\nThe problem is not only that impersonal persons of this sort are\nlikely to suffer from massive indifference, but also that there is\nalleged to be a conceptual difficulty with the very idea of conceiving\nimpartiality in such terms. An abstract or impersonal evaluator, it is\nargued, could not possibly make reliable judgments about substantive\nmoral matters (whether or not he was motivated to), since he would be\nunable to appreciate the particular concerns of the contesting\nparties. Both of these difficulties \u2013 the motivational and the\ncognitive \u2013 are well expressed by Iris Marion Young, who rejects\naltogether the idea that morality is primarily a matter of\nimpartiality:\n\nThe ideal of impartiality is an idealist fiction. It is impossible to\nadopt an unsituated point of view, and if a point of view is situated,\nit cannot stand apart from and understand all points of view. It is\nimpossible to reason about substantive moral issues without\nunderstanding their substance, which always presupposes some\nparticular social and historical context; and one has no motive for\nmaking moral judgments and resolving moral dilemmas unless the outcome\nmatters, unless one has a particular and passionate interest in the\noutcome [\u2026] when class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and\nage define different social locations, one subject cannot fully\nempathize with another in a different social location, adopt her point\nof view; if that were possible then the social locations would not be\ndifferent. (Young 1990, 104\u20135; cf. Benhabib 1987, 90)\n\n",
