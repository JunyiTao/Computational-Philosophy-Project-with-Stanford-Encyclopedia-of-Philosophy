    "main_text": "How to Specify the Threshold || Limits of a Rights-Based Account: Duties Towards the Future\n4.6 Limits of a Rights-Based Account: Duties Towards the Future\n\nA sufficientarian interpretation of the threshold notion of harm\n(together with an appropriate conception of wrongdoing) seems to\nprovide us with a plausible understanding of what is owed to future\npeople: the fact that future persons\u2019 existence is contingent on\nour present decisions does not matter where what is in question is our\nability to harm future people\u2019s interests and to violate their\nrights. By employing a non-comparative notion of harm one can justify\nthe present generation\u2019s duties not to violate the rights of\nfuture generations against being harmed. Accordingly, rights-based\nconsiderations may not bear merely upon \u201csame people\nchoices\u201d, but will bear also upon both types of \u201cdifferent\npeople choices\u201d that Parfit distinguishes, namely \u201csame\nnumber choices\u201d (in which the same number of future people live,\nirrespective of present choices) and \u201cdifferent number\nchoices\u201d (in which a different number of future people will live\ndepending on which choices we now make) (Parfit 1984: 355\u2013356).\nThus, intergenerational sufficientarianism allows us to specify the\nconsiderations of justice relevant for decisions concerning population\npolicies: Future people have rights vis-\u00e0-vis us that reflect\nconsiderations of justice as specified by intergenerational\nsufficientarianism. Our correlative duties set a normative framework\nfor most of our decisions concerning future people, including those\nthat have an impact on their number and identity.\n\nHowever, such a framework does not provide a complete moral theory of\nintergenerational relations and especially not in the context of\ndecisions on the existence, number, and identity of future people.\nThere are concerns for future people that cannot be accounted for by\nrights-based considerations (Jonas 1979; Heyd 1992 and 2009a;\nDe-Shalit 1995: ch. 1; Meyer 1997; Thompson 2009; Scheffler 2013:\n60\u201363, 72\u201373,80\u201381; Sanklecha 2017a, 2017b). First,\nconsider the notion that it is important that there be future people\nat all. However, a person-affecting intergenerational\nsufficientarianism will account for the asymmetry of our procreational\nduties (see\n \u00a72.2):\n On the one hand, prospective parents should refrain from procreation\nout of regard for the child(ren) they would have if the life of their\nchild(ren) would fall below the relevant sufficientarian threshold. On\nthe other hand, people have no obligation to procreate out of regard\nfor the interests of possible future children. Possible people have no\nright to be brought into existence (and we do not have the correlative\nobligation to procreate).\n\nSecond, consider the claim that future people should have a life that\nis well above the level of well-being specified by a threshold notion\nof harm. According to the Shift Thesis (introduced in\n \u00a74.3)\n intergenerational sufficientarianism is compatible with denying that\npeople have above-threshold justice claims and with understanding\nthese claims as less weighty justice\n claims.[14]\n The second concern, in part, reflects a third concern, namely the\nnotion that future people should be able to share (at least certain\naspects of) the particular way of life of currently living people.\nBut, presumably, currently living people do not violate the rights of\nfuture people by failing to sustain particularly valuable aspects of\ntheir way of life for them. Thus, if we take into account all three of\nthe above restrictions, intergenerational sufficientarianism may\nspecify no reason for preferring a future with people all of whom have\nlives far above the level of a sufficiency threshold to a future with\nno\n people.[15]\n\nClearly, considerations based on the rights of future people cannot or\ncannot fully account for all the concerns we might have for future\npeople. What considerations besides rights-based considerations can\nguide us in our relations to future people? It has been suggested that\nthe widely shared concerns about the continuation of human life on\nearth at a high level of well-being can, at least in part, be\naccounted for by an obligation toward future people that have no\ncorrelatives in future people\u2019s rights vis-\u00e0-vis current\npeople. This obligation reflects those widely shared concerns about\nfuture people which cannot be accounted for by rights-based\nconsiderations. The obligation can be described along the following\nlines (Baier 1981; Meyer 2005: chs. 4 and 5; Thompson 2009): those\ncurrently alive owe respect to highly valuable goods that their\npredecessors bequeathed to them as well as to more remote future\npeople, and they also owe respect to the highly valuable\nfuture-oriented projects of their contemporaries. Owing such respect\ngives rise to a general obligation, namely that current people should\nnot willfully destroy the inherited goods and the conditions that are\nconstitutive of persons\u2019 pursuit of future-oriented projects. In\nother words, such respect gives rise to a general obligation that one\nnot willfully destroy the social practices on which the possibility of\npeople pursuing future-oriented projects depends. While future people\nbelong to the beneficiaries, the obligation is owed to both present\nand past people (see also\n \u00a75.4).\n",
