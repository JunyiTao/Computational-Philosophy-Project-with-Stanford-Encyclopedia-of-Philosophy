Does the physical implementation\nof a computational operation have a fundamental thermodynamic cost,\npurely by virtue of its logical properties? These two questions lie at\nthe centre of a large body of literature concerned with the Szilard\nengine (a variant of the Maxwell's demon thought experiment),\nLandauer's principle (supposed to embody the fundamental principle of\nthe thermodynamics of computation) and possible connections between\nthe two. A variety of attempts to answer these questions have\nillustrated many open questions in the foundations of statistical\nmechanics.\n",
