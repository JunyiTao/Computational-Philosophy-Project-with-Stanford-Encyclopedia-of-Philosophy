    "main_text": "Rights and Reasons || Conflicts of Rights?\n5.2 Conflicts of Rights?\n\nMost theorists would agree that A\u2019s claim-right gives\nB what Raz (1975, 35\u201348) calls an exclusionary reason:\na second-order reason not to act on some first-order reason.\nDworkin\u2019s trumping metaphor makes it tempting to characterize\nthe normative force of rights in the stronger terms of\nconclusive reasons. We could indeed attempt to define the\nHohfeldian incidents in these terms. A\u2019s having a\nclaim-right that B \u03c6 would imply that B has a\nconclusive reason to \u03c6, and A\u2019s having a\nprivilege-right to \u03c6 would imply that A has no conclusive\nreason not to \u03c6. Powers and immunities would then determine the\nways in which agents were and were not able to alter the patterns of\nconclusive reasons in the world.\n\nWere we to go this route, we would need to temper the\n\u201cconclusiveness\u201d of the conclusive reasons implied by\nrights assertions to accommodate the facts that some rights have\npriority to others, and that few if any rights outweigh absolutely all\nnon-right considerations in all circumstances. If we associate rights\nwith conclusive reasons, then for at least most rights these reasons\ncan only be conclusive with respect to some but not all competing\nconsiderations.\n\nThis line of thought can be developed by saying that the reasons\nassociated with rights are conclusive within the area covered by\nthe right, but are not conclusive outside of that area. Each\nright trumps competing considerations in most circumstances, but there\nare certain circumstances in which another right with higher\npriority\u2014or a pressing non-right consideration\u2014determines\nwhat may or should be done. From this perspective, the conclusive\nreasons implied by rights assertions really are conclusive, but only\nwithin certain circumstances. Every right is absolute, within a\nprecisely delimited space. (Contrast this position with\nGewirth\u2019s defense of a single, unqualified absolute right.)\n\nThe theoretical position at the end of this line of thought is called\n\u201cspecificationism\u201d (Shafer-Landau 1995, Oberdiek 2008).\nThe specificationist holds that each right is defined by an elaborate\nset of qualifications that specify when it does and when it does not\napply: a set of qualifications that define the right\u2019s\n\u201cspace.\u201d\n\nThe test of specificationism is how convincingly it can explain what\noccurs when rights appear to conflict. Rights do often appear to\nconflict (Sinnott-Armstrong 1996; Kamm 2007, 262\u2013301). For example, on\na certain day it may seem that the public\u2019s right to protest is\nconflicting with the government\u2019s right to keep order on public\nproperty. When confronted with a case like this one, we will judge\nthat one or the other (say, the public\u2019s) right should prevail.\nHowever, we do not believe that one of these rights is always stronger\nthan the other. Given different circumstances, our judgment might\nfavor the other (in this case, the government\u2019s) right. When\nrights appear to conflict like this, the usefulness of the image of\nrights as trumps begins to dim. Both of these rights are trump cards,\nyet it does not appear that one right always trumps the other.\n\nA specificationist will attempt to dispel any appearance of conflict\nof rights. For example, a specificationist will say that what is\ncolloquially referred to as \u201cthe public\u2019s right to\nprotest\u201d is actually, on closer examination, \u201cthe\npublic\u2019s right to protest, unless the protest would cause\nserious risk to life or property, or would lead to the spread of a\ndeadly disease, or\u2026\u201d Similarly, the government\u2019s\nright should really be specified more fully as the right: \u201cto\ncontrol what happens on public property, but not to the extent of\nstopping peaceful protest, unless the protest would lead to the spread\nof deadly disease, but not\u2026\u201d On the specificationist\nview, rights never do conflict in the sense of overlapping in a given\ncase. Rather, rights fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, so\nthat in each circumstance there is only one right which determines\nwhat is permitted, forbidden or required. Every right is absolute\nwithin its own area, but the area in which each right prevails is\nelaborately gerrymandered. Rights never conflict: they are always, to\nuse Steiner\u2019s phrase, \u201ccompossible\u201d (Steiner\n1994).\n\nFeinberg (1980, 221\u201351) and Thomson (1990, 82\u2013104) object\nto this specificationist view of rights. First, fully specified rights\nwould be unknowable: no one could set out all of the qualifications\nthat define even the simplest right. Second, rights so understood lose\ntheir explanatory force: for the specificationist rights can only be\nthe conclusions, not the premises, of arguments concerning which side\nin any dispute should prevail. Third, specificationists cannot explain\nthe \u201cmoral residue\u201d of a \u201cdefeated\u201d right. For\ninstance, consider a case in which your property right in the pie\ncooling on your window sill conflicts with John\u2019s right to do\nwhat he must do to keep from starving. John\u2019s right may prevail\nin this case: John may have a right to eat your pie. Still, after John\nrightfully eats your pie he should apologize to you, and compensate\nyou if he can.\n\nThomson alleges that specificationists cannot explain the requirements\nthat John apologizes to and compensates you, since on the\nspecificationist view there is no right of yours that he has violated\nwhen he consumes your food. Thomson prefers the view that there really\nare conflicts of rights, and suggests that we should speak of a\n\u201cdefeated\u201d right as being permissibly\n\u201cinfringed\u201d (instead of \u201cviolated\u201d), leaving\nresidual obligations on the infringer. Frederick (2014) chases down\nsome specificationist replies to these objections, and concludes that\nalthough moral rights are strong moral considerations, they are only\npro tanto. Liberto (2014) develops a more sophisticated\nspecificationist position, which is critiqued by Montague (2015).\nMullins (forthcoming) offers a logical framework of practical reasoning that\nclaims to capture the dynamics of the debate over specification.\n",
