Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274), for\nexample, follows Aristotle in holding that sensation is not deceived\nwith regard to its proper objects, such as colours and sounds\n(ST 1a 17.3), provided that the sense organs are functioning\nproperly and in the right circumstances (Pasnau 2002:\n188\u201389).\n\nDid medieval philosophers embrace a form of genetic empiricism? The\nLatin phrase characterizing an empiricism of this kind\u2014nihil\nest in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu (nothing is in\nthe intellect that was not first in sensation)\u2014was something of\na commonplace. It is found (in variant forms) in the work of\nBonaventure (1221\u20131274), where it is attributed to Aristotle,\nAquinas, Matthew of Aquasparta (ca. 1240\u20131302), and Duns Scotus\n(1266\u20131308) (Cranefield 1970: 78\u201379). Not all accepted the\nidea, as we shall see, but Aristotelians generally took it for\ngranted. Aquinas follows Aristotle (DA 432a7\u20139) in\nholding that all the objects of our understanding \u201chave their\nbeing in the objects of perception,\u201d rather than in some\nseparated, Platonic realm. It follows that \u201cwithout sense\nperception no one can either learn anything new, nor understand\nmatters already learned.\u201d Even when we are thinking about\nsomething we already know, our thought is always accompanied by an\nimage (a \u201cphantasm\u201d), which is a likeness of something\nthat can be perceived (Aquinas In DA 3.13 [para. 791]).\n\nBut even when medieval writers speak of the mind as a tabula\nrasa, we should not attribute to them the kind of genetic\nempiricism later found in the work of John Locke. The blank tablet of\nwhich medievals speak, following Aristotle (DA 430a1), is\nwhat they called the \u201cpassive\u201d or \u201cpotential\u201d\nintellect, which was only one element in the process of cognition\n (sect. 4.3).\n When it comes to the larger picture, medieval philosophers sometimes\ncombine the Aristotelian idea that all knowledge comes through the\nsenses with an Augustinian view, which speak of divine illumination\n (sect. 4.2),\n or with the idea of innate knowledge. Even Aquinas held that we have\na kind of innate capacity, ultimately given by God, to grasp the first\nprinciples of scientific knowledge (Pasnau 2002: 307\u20138). This is\nprobably best thought of as a kind of a dispositional\ninnatism: we are disposed to form certain ideas when presented with\nthe right kind of experience.\n\nAt times Aquinas seems to go further. He writes, for instance, that\nour knowledge arises \u201cpartly from within and partly from\nwithout\u201d and that there is some truth in the idea that \u201cwe\nalready know that which we learn\u201d (Aquinas DV 10.6).\nOnce again, however, this looks like a dispositional innatism: the\nprinciples we employ in forming our beliefs are implicit in the\nstructure of the mind and its operations (Allers 1942: 58) (see\n sect. 4.3).\n Other writers are clearer in combining the tabula rasa idea\nwith a commitment to the idea of innate knowledge. Roger Bacon\n(1215\u20131292), for instance, suggests that the human soul is\ncreated with the species (aspects or forms) of all things\nwithin it, which reflects an Augustinian conception of knowledge. But\nsince the soul\u2019s union with the body hinders our access to this\nknowledge, the human mind (as potential intellect) can be described as\na \u201cblank slate\u201d (tabula nuda or rasa)\n(Bacon In Phys. pp. 7, 9; R. Wood 2007: 54). A similar view\nis found in the work of Robert Grosseteste (ca. 1165\u20131253), who\nalso combines a modified Augustinian belief in divine illumination\n (sect. 4.2)\n with the Aristotelian idea that we gain knowledge of scientific\nprinciples from experience (van Dyke 2009: 688\u201389).\n\nWhile these look like puzzling combinations of empiricist and\nnon-empiricist views, their rationale will become clear shortly\n (sect. 4.3).\n But alongside this qualified genetic empiricism, we also find\nexpressions of a justificatory empiricism. In particular, the work of\nRoger Bacon sets out two forms of justificatory empiricism, both of\nwhich fall under the heading of what he calls scientia\nexperimentalis. The first involves confirming well-founded\ndeliverances of reason by \u201ctrying them out,\u201d as it were,\nfor oneself (Hackett 2015: sect. 5.4.3). Bacon\u2019s rationale for\nurging this kind of testing is that arguments alone are insufficient\nto convince us of the truth of any practical matter.\n\u201cReasoning,\u201d he writes,\n\n\ndraws a conclusion and forces us to grant it, but it does not confirm\nit nor remove doubt so that the mind may rest in the knowledge of the\ntruth, unless this is found by way of experience. \u2026 For if a\nman \u2026 should prove by way of adequate arguments that fire burns\nand harms and destroys things, still the mind of the hearer would not\nrest on this account nor would such a person avoid fire before he had\nplaced his hand or some combustible material in fire, so that he might\ntest by experience [ut per experientiam probaret] what the\nargument had taught. (Bacon OM 6.1)\n\n\nIt follows (in a phrase for which Bacon has become famous) that\n\u201cwithout experience nothing can be sufficiently known\u201d\n(sine experientia nihil sufficienter sciri potest)\n(OM 6.1).\n\nA second form of justificatory empiricism holds that some beliefs can\nbe defended only by reference to experience, there being no\narguments from prior principles that can be adduced in their support.\nThese include, first of all, matters within the domain of the other\nsciences which mere reasoning could never have revealed, such as the\npractical discoveries made by alchemists (Bacon OM 6, 2a\nprae.). But there are also matters that fall outside the domain of any\nspeculative science, fields of inquiry in which scientia\nexperimentalis \u201cby its own power investigates the secrets\nof nature\u201d (Bacon OM 6, 3a prae.). To appreciate what\nthis kind of investigation entailed, we need to understand the class\nof phenomena to which it applied: that of the secrets of nature.\n\nThe domain of natural philosophy was \u201cthe common course of\nnature\u201d (Biard 2001: 79, 80): it dealt with what occurred (in\nAristotle\u2019s phrase) \u201ceither always or for the most\npart\u201d (\u0113 tou aei \u0113 tou h\u014ds epi to polu)\n(Met. 1027a21\u201322). But there existed phenomena that\nfell outside this domain, namely miracles and marvels. Miracles, in\nthe strict sense, were supernatural occurrences, which fell in the\ndomain of theology. But marvellous phenomena were often thought of as\n\u201cpreternatural,\u201d that is to say, as brought about by\noccult but natural properties and powers (Daston 1991: 95\u2013100).\nSuch powers included the influence exercised by the heavenly bodies on\nearthly affairs, as well as mysterious properties of sublunary\nentities, such as the lodestone. These powers were occult in the sense\nof being hidden. But they were also mysterious in that their workings\nwere not explicable in terms of what Aristotelians believed to be the\nfour simple substances (earth, air, fire, and water) and their\nassociated primary qualities (the hot and the cold, the moist and the\ndry) (Pasnau 2011: 44). It is for this reason that they could not be\nproved to exist by demonstrative arguments, but could be known only by\nexperience. This gave rise to a particular form of empiricism\nassociated with the study of \u201cnatural magic.\u201d\n\nAn example can be found in the work of an author already mentioned:\nNicholas of Poland, the radical medical empiricist of Montpellier. In\nhis Antipocras, Nicholas claims that although the presence of\na divinely given power in the most humble of objects cannot be proven\nby reason, it \u201cis made evident by its effect\u201d (hoc\npatet effectu) (Nicholas of Poland Ant. ll.\n202\u20133). In this respect Nicholas seems to have been influenced\nby another work more closely associated with magic, the De\nmirabilibus mundi. This states that there are \u201ccertain\neffects manifest to the senses to which we can assign no\nreason,\u201d as well as effects known only by way of reason. The\nmarvellous powers of natural objects belong to the former category,\nwhich are known by way of practical experience (per\nexperientiam) (Ps-Albertus PA-DM para. 49\u201350).\nWhile this work was falsely attributed to Albert the Great (ca.\n1200\u20131280), Albert himself adopts a similar line when defending\nthe mysterious powers of certain stones: these, too, are known\n\u201cmost convincingly by experience,\u201d although they lack a\nscientific explanation (A-DM 2.1.1).\n\nWhen medieval writers speak of knowing matters per\nexperientiam (by experience), they are understanding the term\nexperientia very broadly. The same may be said of the term\nexperimentalis, so that the phrase scientia\nexperimentalis should be translated as \u201cexperiential\nknowledge\u201d rather than \u201cexperimental science.\u201d\nAlthough Bacon\u2019s scientia experimentalis did include\npractical procedures (experimenta), as were used in alchemy,\nas well as the use of instruments (as in the study of optics and\nastronomy), it also included simple observation as well as reliance on\nsecond-hand reports of dubious value. (We are still a long way from\nthe motto of the seventeenth-century Royal Society: nullius in\nverba, \u201ctake no man\u2019s word for it.\u201d) Nor is\nthere any consistent link with quantification. In only a few fields,\nsuch as astronomy, are the procedures employed by natural philosophers\nassociated with careful measurement.\n\nIn the century following Bacon\u2019s work, we do find the\ndevelopment of what we may call \u201cquantified concepts,\u201d\nparticularly in the study of local motion. We find this, in\nparticular, in the work of the Oxford calculatores associated\nwith Merton College, who are perhaps best known for their formulation\nof the \u201cmean speed theorem.\u201d This was the idea that\n\n\na uniform acceleration produces the same \u2026 distance travelled\nin a given time, as a uniform velocity equal to the instantaneous\nvelocity at the middle instance of the time of acceleration. (Crombie\n1961: 153)\n\n\nBut while such developments mark a break with the Aristotelian\ntradition of a purely qualitative physics, they remain largely\ntheoretical. While the discussions giving rise to the mean speed\ntheorem emerged from everyday observations of falling bodies, the\ntheorem itself was proven arithmetically and geometrically (Clagett\n1959: 256, 259\u201360). The principles developed were not\n\u201coperationalized,\u201d that is to say, expressed in forms that\nwould allow for experimental testing (Clagett 1959: 206). Their\nexperimental testing had to await Galileo\u2019s inclined plane\nexperiments (Crombie 1961: 153\u201354).\n\nThis broad understanding of experience is evident, too, in medieval\nconceptions of the origin and scope of perceptual knowledge. With\nregard to the origins of such knowledge, later empiricists would focus\nalmost exclusively on the five \u201cexterior senses.\u201d But\nmedieval authors, following Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101;\n980\u20131037), commonly list up to five \u201cinterior\nsenses\u201d (Bates 2010: 138\u201339) alongside the exterior ones.\nAquinas reduces these to four: the common sense, the imagination, the\nvis aestimativa (or cogitativa), and the sense\nmemory (Aquinas ST 1a 78.4). The work of these interior\nsenses involves an active role in shaping our perceptions, even those\nof our physical environment. The mind, in other words, is not entirely\npassive, even at its basic levels of operation. The vis\naestimativa, for instance, refers to the power that even\nnon-rational creatures have of making judgements about what is\ndangerous or useful: it shapes our perceptions by adding an evaluative\ncomponent.\n\nWith regard to the scope of experience, this was generally thought to\ninclude knowledge of our own interior acts. That we have some kind of\nimmediate access to such knowledge was \u201cone of the truisms of\nAugustinian thought\u201d (Leff 1975: 28). Its mechanism was\nunclear\u2014Scotus says simply that we know these things \u201cby\nway of a certain sense, that is, an interior perception\u201d\n(quodam sensu, id est, perceptione interiore) (Scotus\nOrd. IV d. 43, q. 2)\u2014but its existence was not in\ndoubt. As an anonymous scribe wrote in the margin of one of\nOckham\u2019s manuscripts, the idea that \u201cthere is nothing in\nthe intellect unless it was formerly in the [exterior] senses\u201d\napplies to \u201cexternal objects, not to its own acts\u201d (Leff\n1975: 28 n.116). In Bacon\u2019s work, this focus on inner experience\nis taken a step further, insofar as his conception of experience\nembraces not only our everyday mental states, but also spiritual\nstates up to and including \u201craptures\u201d in which people have\nvisions of things \u201cof which it is not lawful for human beings to\nspeak\u201d (Bacon OM 6.2). These are experiences brought\nabout by the grace of God, rather than any purely natural process of\ncognition.\n\nI have been arguing that medieval thought included a qualified form of\ngenetic empiricism (to which I shall return) and a distinctive form of\njustificatory empiricism, coupled with a broad understanding of\n\u201cexperience.\u201d What about explanatory empiricism? Insofar\nas medieval natural philosophy was influenced by Aristotle it shared\nhis view of scientific explanations. For the most part these did not\ninvoke unobservable entities that are distinct from the\nexplanandum, but generative powers that stem from very nature\nof the object being investigated\n (sect. 3.2).\n Medieval thinkers did not deny that we could know about unobservable\nentities. God, after all, was an unobservable entity, and thinkers\nsuch as Aquinas thought that \u201cnatural reason\u201d could know\nsomething about God, albeit by way of analogy. (William of Ockham [ca.\n1285\u20131347] would later downplay the extent of such knowledge,\nwithout dismissing it altogether [Leff 1975: 382\u201398].) But there\nwere limits to what we could know about the unobservable features of\nthe natural world (Hutchison 1982: 235\u201336). Aquinas, for\ninstance, appears to endorse Aristotle\u2019s view that when it comes\nto matters that are \u201cnot manifest to the senses\u201d\n(immanifesta sensui) we should not demand \u201ca certain\nand necessary demonstration\u201d; a merely possible explanation may\nbe the best we can achieve (Aquinas In Meteor. 1.7 [lect.\n11]). One could regard this as a very modest kind of explanatory\nempiricism.\n\nOne late medieval writer did embrace a stronger version of explanatory\nempiricism. This was Nicholas of Autrecourt (1299\u20131369).\nNicholas\u2019s central idea is that (outside of the articles of\nfaith) we can have certain knowledge only of propositions whose denial\nwould result in a contradiction. But since we can, without\ncontradiction, affirm the existence of something while denying the\nexistence of that which is thought to be its cause, we can have no\ncertain knowledge when it comes to causation. In a similar way, we\ncannot infer the existence of an underlying substance from appearances\nof things (Thijssen 1987: 243\u201344). More generally, Nicholas\nwrites, \u201cfrom the fact that something is known to be, it cannot\nbe inferred evidently \u2026 that there is some other thing\u201d\n(Letter to Bernard 2, \u00a711 [p. 65]). These observations amount to\na vigorous attack on the Aristotelian ideal of scientific\nunderstanding: the idea that we can (at least in principle) have\ncertain knowledge of the essences of things (Stiefel 1992: 299).\n\nNicholas remains an empiricist rather than a thorough-going sceptic,\nfor he believes that we cannot, without contradiction, deny what\nappears to be the case. I cannot, for example, affirm both that a\n\u201cwhite patch appears to me and that it does not appear to\nme\u201d (Copleston 1974: 253). The problem is that this certainty is\nlimited to appearances; it does not extend to the things themselves.\nTo escape from scepticism, Nicholas has to revert to merely probable\nknowledge. As he writes \u201cif we have any certainty about things,\nit is probable that everything that appears to be is (omne illud\nquod apparet esse sit), and that everything that appears to be\ntrue is true (omne illud quod apparet esse verum sit\nverum)\u201d (EO p. 228). This merely probable\nknowledge is itself conditional: it holds on the condition that\n\u201cwe have any certainty about things.\u201d What makes Nicholas\nconfident this condition is fulfilled is his firm conviction regarding\n\u201cthe goodness and purposiveness of things\u201d (Weinberg 1948:\n127), a view that reminds us of the Stoics\n (sect. 3.3.4\n Nicholas believes that \u201csince falsehood is an evil of the\nintellect, the complete goodness of the universe would have to be\ndenied if the human desire to know were eternally thwarted\u201d\n(Weinberg 1948: 193). But this principle of goodness is itself a\nmatter of merely probable knowledge (Weinberg 1948: 127\u201328).\n",
