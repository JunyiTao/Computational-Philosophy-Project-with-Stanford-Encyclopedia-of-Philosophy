This is hardly true for another issue of\ncentral concern to analytic philosophy of technology, which is the\nstatus and the character of artifacts. This is perhaps not unlike the\nsituation in the philosophy of science, where working scientists seem\nalso to be much less interested in investigating the status and\ncharacter of models and theories than philosophers are.\n\nArtifacts are man-made objects: they have an author (see Hilpinen 1992\nand Hilpinen\u2019s article\n artifact\n in this encyclopedia). The artifacts that are of relevance to\ntechnology are, additionally, made to serve a purpose. This excludes,\nwithin the set of all man-made objects, byproducts and waste products\nand equally, though controversially, works of art. Byproducts and\nwaste products result from an intentional act to make something but\njust not precisely, although the author at work may be well aware of\ntheir creation. Works of art result from an intention directed at\ntheir creation (although in exceptional cases of conceptual art, this\ndirectedness may involve many intermediate steps) but it is contested\nwhether artists include in their intentions concerning their work an\nintention that the work serves some purpose. Nevertheless, most\nphilosophers of technology who discuss the metaphysics of artifacts\nexclude artworks from their analyses. A further discussion of this\naspect belongs to the philosophy of art. An interesting general\naccount which does not do so has been presented by Dipert (1993).\n\nTechnical artifacts, then, are made to serve some purpose, generally\nto be used for something or to act as a component in a larger\nartifact, which in its turn is either something to be used or again a\ncomponent. Whether end product or component, an artifact is \u2018for\nsomething\u2019, and what it is for is called the artifact\u2019s\nfunction. Several researchers have emphasized that an\nadequate description of artifacts must refer both to their status as\ntangible physical objects and to the intentions of the people engaged\nwith them. Kroes and Meijers (2006) have dubbed this view \u201cthe\ndual nature of technical artifacts\u201d; its most mature formulation\nis Kroes 2012. They suggest that the two aspects are \u2018tied\nup\u2019, so to speak, in the notion of artifact function. This gives\nrise to several problems. One, which will be passed over quickly\nbecause little philosophical work seems to have been done concerning\nit, is that structure and function mutually constrain each other, but\nthe constraining is only partial. It is unclear whether a general\naccount of this relation is possible and what problems need to be\nsolved to arrive there. There may be interesting connections with the\nissue of multiple realizability in the philosophy of mind and with\naccounts of reduction in science; an example where this is explored is\nMahner and Bunge 2001.\n\nIt is equally problematic whether a unified account of the notion of\nfunction as such is possible, but this issue has received considerably\nmore philosophical attention. The notion of function is of paramount\nimportance for characterizing artifacts, but the notion is used much\nmore widely. The notion of an artifact\u2019s function seems to refer\nnecessarily to human intentions. Function is also a key concept in\nbiology, however, where no intentionality plays a role, and it is a\nkey concept in cognitive science and the philosophy of mind, where it\nis crucial in grounding intentionality in non-intentional, structural\nand physical properties. Up till now there is no accepted general\naccount of function that covers both the intentionality-based notion\nof artifact function and the non-intentional notion of biological\nfunction\u2014not to speak of other areas where the concept plays a\nrole, such as the social sciences. The most comprehensive theory, that\nhas the ambition to account for the biological notion, cognitive\nnotion and the intentional notion, is Ruth Millikan\u2019s 1984; for\ncriticisms and replies, see Preston 1998, 2003; Millikan 1999; Vermaas\n& Houkes 2003; and Houkes & Vermaas 2010. The collection of\nessays edited by Ariew, Cummins and Perlman (2002) presents an\nintroduction to the topic of characterizing the notion of function,\nalthough the emphasis is on biological functions. This emphasis\nremains very strong in the literature, as can be judged from the most\nrecent critical overview (Garson 2016), which explicitly refrains from\ndiscussing artifact functions.\n\nAgainst the view that, at least in the case of artifacts, the notion\nof function refers necessarily to intentionality, it could be argued\nthat in discussing the functions of the components of a larger device,\nand the interrelations between these functions, the intentional\n\u2018side\u2019 of these functions is of secondary importance only.\nThis, however, would be to ignore the possibility of the\nmalfunctioning of such components. This notion seems to be\ndefinable only in terms of a mismatch between actual behavior and\nintended behavior. The notion of malfunction also sharpens an\nambiguity in the general reference to intentions when characterizing\ntechnical artifacts. These artifacts usually engage many people, and\nthe intentions of these people may not all pull in the same direction.\nA major distinction can be drawn between the intentions of the actual\nuser of an artifact for a particular purpose and the intentions of the\nartifact\u2019s designer. Since an artifact may be used for a purpose\ndifferent from the one for which its designer intended it to be used,\nand since people may also use natural objects for some purpose or\nother, one is invited to allow that artifacts can have multiple\nfunctions, or to enforce a hierarchy among all relevant intentions in\ndetermining the function of an artifact, or to introduce a\nclassification of functions in terms of the sorts of determining\nintentions. In the latter case, which is a sort of middle way between\nthe two other options, one commonly distinguishes between the\nproper function of an artifact as the one intended by its\ndesigner and the accidental function of the artifact as the\none given to it by some user on private considerations. Accidental use\ncan become so common, however, that the original function drops out of\nmemory.\n\nClosely related to this issue to what extent use and design determine\nthe function of an artifact is the problem of characterizing artifact\nkinds. It may seem that we use functions to classify artifacts: an\nobject is a knife because it has the function of cutting, or more\nprecisely, of enabling us to cut. On closer inspection, however, the\nlink between function and kind-membership seems much less\nstraightforward. The basic kinds in technology are, for example,\n\u2018knife\u2019, \u2018aircraft\u2019 and \u2018piston\u2019.\nThe members of these kinds have been designed in order to be used to\ncut something with, to transport something through the air and to\ngenerate mechanical movement through thermodynamic expansion,\nrespectively. However, one cannot create a particular kind of artifact\njust by designing something with the intention that it be used for\nsome particular purpose: a member of the kind so created must actually\nbe useful for that purpose. Despite innumerable design attempts and\nclaims, the perpetual motion machine is not a kind of artifact. A kind\nlike \u2018knife\u2019 is defined, therefore, not only by the\nintentions of the designers of its members that they each be useful\nfor cutting but also by a shared operational principle known to these\ndesigners, and on which they based their design. This is, in a\ndifferent setting, also defended by Thomasson, who in her\ncharacterization of what she in general calls an artifactual\nkind says that such a kind is defined by the designer\u2019s\nintention to make something of that kind, by a substantive idea that\nthe designer has of how this can be achieved, and by his or her\nlargely successful achievement of it (Thomasson 2003, 2007). Qua sorts\nof kinds in which artifacts can be grouped, a distinction must\ntherefore be made between a kind like \u2018knife\u2019 and a\ncorresponding but different kind \u2018cutter\u2019. A\n\u2018knife\u2019 indicates a particular way a \u2018cutter\u2019\ncan be made. One can also cut, however, with a thread or line, a\nwelding torch, a water jet, and undoubtedly by other sorts of means\nthat have not yet been thought of. A \u2018cutter\u2019 would then\nrefer to a truly functional kind. As such, it is subject to the\nconflict between use and design: one could mean by\n\u2018cutter\u2019 anything than can be used for cutting or anything\nthat has been designed to be used for cutting, by the application of\nwhatever operational principle, presently known or unknown.\n\nThis distinction between artifact kinds and functional kinds is\nrelevant for the status of such kinds in comparison to other notions\nof kinds. Philosophy of science has emphasized that the concept of\nnatural kind, such as exemplified by \u2018water\u2019 or\n\u2018atom\u2019, lies at the basis of science. On the other hand it\nis generally taken for granted that there are no regularities that all\nknives or airplanes or pistons answer to. This, however, is loosely\nbased on considerations of multiple realizability that fully apply\nonly to functional kinds, not to artifact kinds. Artifact kinds share\nan operational principle that gives them some commonality in physical\nfeatures, and this commonality becomes stronger once a particular\nartifact kind is subdivided into narrower kinds. Since these kinds are\nspecified in terms of physical and geometrical parameters, they are\nmuch closer to the natural kinds of science, in that they support\nlaw-like regularities; see for a defense of this position (Soavi\n2009). A recent collection of essays that discuss the metaphysics of\nartifacts and artifact kinds is Franssen, Kroes, Reydon and Vermaas\n2014.\n",
