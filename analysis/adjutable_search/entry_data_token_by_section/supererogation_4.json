    "main_text": "Three Views of Supererogation: Problems of Justification || Qualified Supererogationism\n3.2 Qualified Supererogationism\n\nCompletely denying the existence and value of supererogatory action\ndoes not fit with most people\u2019s intuitions. One way to account\nfor supererogation without giving up the moral and theoretical\nprinciple relating the \u2018good\u2019 to the \u2018ought\u2019,\nvalue to duty, is to distinguish between different kinds of duties and\nobligations or to specify conditions and limits of the application of\nduties. Supererogation is a legitimate class of moral action but only\nin a qualified sense, i.e. due to certain conditions that make the\nmoral \u2018ought\u2019 inapplicable or not fully prescriptive. This\nintermediate position seems to be the most common in the literature on\nsupererogation, but it has many forms and variations.\n\nAccounts of supererogation belonging to this group typically appeal to\nthe linguistic hybrid \u201csupererogatory requirements\u201d or\neven \u201csupererogatory duties.\u201d Thus, for instance, contract\ntheorists (Richards 1971) describe principles of supererogation as\nthose that ideal contractors in the original position would consent\nnot to enforce in society. Supererogatory behavior is a\nrequirement, but punishing those who do not fulfill the requirement\nwould be too costly in terms of the relative pain incurred to the\nagent as against the benefit to the potential beneficiary. Failure to\nact supererogatorily is blameworthy and wrong, but lends itself only\nto informal criticism rather than to institutionalized sanction.\nSupererogation is justified only in qualified, circumstantial terms\nrelating to the limited effectiveness of its enforcement. It has no\nintrinsic value. The idea of \u2018Forced supererogation\u2019\nbelongs to this kind of account: there are actions which are\npraiseworthy and although their omission not blameworthy it is plainly\nwrong not to do them (Cohen 2013).\n\nAnother line of justifying supererogation without relinquishing the\nprinciple of \u2018good\u2019-entails-\u2018ought\u2019 goes back\nto Thomas Aquinas but has some contemporary followers who sometimes\nspeak in terms of vocation. Supererogatory behavior is\nrequired, but not of everybody. It can be expected only from\nthose who subjectively feel the commitment to do it or from those who\nare objectively blessed with the necessary strength of character and\nvirtue. Unlike the previous view, which distinguished between duty and\nsupererogation in terms of the overall costs of enforcing duty, this\napproach is based on a principle of excuse: most human\nbeings, due to their frail moral nature and imperfection are excused\nfrom omitting what from an ideal (religious, ethical) point of view is\nprescribed as a duty. The problem with this excused-based view of\nsupererogation is that it is either subjectivist (the individual\nchooses her duties) or aristocratic (distinguishing between classes of\nmoral agents). Furthermore, it fails to distinguish between the common\nappeals to excuses from obligatory action based on the particular\ndifficulty or risk involved in its performance and the general\nexemption from supererogatory action that is sometimes easy and\npossible for everybody (like doing a small favor or showing\nforgiveness). Rawls\u2019 analysis of supererogation also appeals to\nan argument from exemption: \u201cSupererogatory acts are not\nrequired, though normally they would be were it not for the loss or\nrisk involved for the agent himself. A person who does a\nsupererogatory act does not invoke the exemption which the natural\nduties allow\u201d (Rawls 1971, p. 117).\n\nA structurally similar analysis of supererogation is offered in terms\nof reasons for action. We may have a good (even a conclusive) reason\nto act in a certain way, but also a second-order permission not to act\non that good reason. This permission, called\n\u201cexclusionary,\u201d is based on a second-order reason and\nallows the agent to disregard the balance of first order reasons for\naction. An agent acts supererogatorily if despite the permission to\nignore these reasons, decides to act on them (Raz 1975). Typically,\nother-regarding considerations such as promoting the overall good\nserve as the kind of first-order conclusive reasons for an action\n(making it prima facie obligatory), whereas self-regarding\nconsiderations of the individual\u2019s autonomy to pursue her own\ngoals in life support the second-order permission not to engage in\nthat action. Self-sacrifice is again a paradigm example of\nsupererogation. Although personal autonomy is not strictly speaking an\nexcuse, it creates a kind of exemption from doing the morally\nrequired act. But the autonomy of the individual cannot serve to break\nthe good-ought tie-up, since it presupposes the independent\nvalue of the personal good from what ought to be done rather than\nestablish it (Dancy 1988). Furthermore, supererogationists of the\nunqualified kind would resist this exemption-based analysis as playing\ndown the positive moral value of supererogation and relegating it to\nthe morally neutral category of the \u201cpermitted\u201d (Heyd\n1992).\n\nThere is an interesting suggestion that supererogatory action is\ngrounded in moral reasons which are opposed by rational reasons of a\nnonmoral kind (Portmore 2003, Portmore 2008). Thus, I have a perfectly\ngood moral reason to help an AIDS stricken community, but such a\nchoice would, all things considered, be irrational due to the risk to\nmy life and health or to the loss in achieving personal projects with\nwhich I identify. Thus, nonmoral reasons can prevent moral reasons\nfrom having a morally requiring force. Theoretically this\nanalysis opens a wide gap between rationality and morality which\nphilosophers are reluctant to accept. Moral requirements according to\nthis view have force only when they are backed not only by direct\nmoral reasons but also by the entire scheme of reasons by which I make\npractical choices and these might point to a conclusive reason not to\nact morally. \"Supererogatory actions just are those that are morally\ngood, but for which one does not have decisive practical reason\"\n(Dorsey 2013, pp. 381-2). Critics of this approach have pointed out\nthat first, not all supererogatory action is irrational and secondly,\na moral theory which encourages us to perform irrational action is\ndefective (Postow 2005). But note that this critique implies a\nqualified form of supererogationism since the only way to explain why\nwe are free not to act on the best reason overall is that we are\nexcused or exempted from the action supported by the set of moral\nand rational reasons.\n\nQualified versions of supererogationism try to salvage a prescriptive\nelement in the analysis of the concept without collapsing\nsupererogation into duty (which would amount to denying its separate\nexistence). Identifying supererogation with a weaker kind of duty, an\nimperfect duty, a non-universalizable duty, an \u2018ought\u2019\nrather than a duty are all forms of recognition of supererogatory acts\nbut only as being an integral part of an overall conception of duty.\nThey maintain the deontic integrity of the moral system but by that\nrun the risk of losing sight of what makes supererogatory action\nuniquely meritorious, sometimes praiseworthy, and often touching.\n",
