    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy || The Latitude of Forms\n6.2 The Latitude of Forms\n\nIn his minor work, the Tractatus alphabeticus, Wodeham takes\nup the question of qualitative change and offers a position that is\nconsistent with his overall opposition to atomism (cf. Wood 1990).\nAccording to Sylla, there were three dominant views of qualitative\nchange that shaped the context of the discussion: the succession\ntheory, the addition theory, and the admixture theory (Sylla 1973,\n230\u2013232). The succession and addition theory distinguish\nthemselves from the admixture theory in that they are both committed\nto the fact that qualitative forms themselves do not change in degree.\nRather it is the subject that changes in degree through the\nacquisition of a new qualitative form (cf. Sylla 1973, 232; Wood 1990,\n375). Wodeham, in relative concord with the views of Ockham and\nFitzRalph and against the Mertonian Campsall and his usual nemesis\nWalter Chatton, argues against the admixture theory. He claims that it\nis impossible for one and the same quality to be changed while\nretaining its identity. As Wood says: \n\n\nAddition and succession of forms theorists agree on this issue; in no\nsense is it true that the same form undergoes remission or\nintension\u2026strictly speaking it is the subject, not the form,\nwhich becomes more white, more hot or more charitable. (Wood 1990,\n375)\n\n\nA helpful analog can be found in the case of numbers. When the number\n9 is increased to 10, Wodeham understands the admixture theorist to be\nclaiming that the same form has been intensified, but he wonders how\nthis numerically identical form can really be said to retain its old\nidentity now that it has been increased to 10 and is no longer 9.\n\nWhile the succession and addition theorist are united in their\nopposition to any admixture, and while both believe that intension and\nremission occur in the subject and not in the qualitative form, they\ndisagree about just how this intension and remission occurs. In the\nTractatus alphabeticus, Wodeham shows himself to be numbered\namong the addition theorists. The key difference here is that the\nsuccession theorist believes that when a quality increases a new form\nof a given quality destroys and then replaces the old form. Wodeham\nand the addition theorist disagree. They hold that when qualitative\nchange happens, a new form is indeed acquired, but it does not destroy\nthe proceeding form. On the contrary, the new form takes in the\npreceding form as one of its parts. And here, the analogy of\nquantitative change is again helpful. When 9 increases to 10, the\nsuccession theorist argues that the old form of 9 is completely\ndestroyed and replaced by an entirely new form, where no part of the\nold form of 9 contributes to the new form of 10. In opposition, the\naddition theorist argues that when a quality increases, this is\nanalogous to the number 1 being added to 9, and through this addition,\nthe new form of 10 is created. In this case, the old form of 9 has not\nbeen destroyed, but rather becomes a part of the new whole.\n\nA critical underlying difference between the succession and addition\ntheorists is the question over whether forms are indivisible or can be\nperpetually broken down into smaller parts. The succession theorist\nthinks forms are indivisible and do not contain parts (Sylla 1973,\n231). But Adam Wodeham, in harmony with his general anti-atomists\nposition, argues that forms can be infinitely divided. In this way,\nthere is no trouble in saying that, through addition, a new form is\ncreated, which contains the old form as one of its parts.\n",
