    "main_text": "Brief Historical Remarks || The Loci Classici\n3.1 The Loci Classici\n\nThe loci classici are to be found in Book XI of the\nConfessions of Augustine (354\u2013430) and Book V of\nBoethius\u2019s (480\u2013c.525) The Consolation of\nPhilosophy. (The extent to which the Platonism of Philo of\nAlexandria [c. 25 BCE\u2013CE 40], particularly as applied to the idea\nof creation [for example, in his De opificio mundi] was\ninfluential, is not clear.) However, the styles of these two thinkers\nare very different. Boethius presents the idea of timeless eternity as\nstraightforward and relatively problem-free. Augustine wrestles with\nthe idea and expresses continual puzzlement at the idea of time itself\nand with it the contrasting idea of timeless eternity.\n\nIn Boethius, the contrast is between timeless eternity, which only God\nenjoys, and everlastingness, which (following Plato) the world itself\npossesses.\n\n\nIt is the common judgement, then, of all creatures that live by reason\nthat God is eternal. So let us consider the nature of eternity, for\nthis will make clear to us both the nature of God and his manner of\nknowing. Eternity, then, is the complete, simultaneous and perfect\npossession of everlasting life; this will be clear from a comparison\nwith creatures that exist in time.\n\n\u2026for it is one thing to progress like the world in\nPlato\u2019s theory through everlasting life, and another thing to\nhave embraced the whole of everlasting life in one simultaneous\npresent. (Boethius Consolation, V.VI., transl. V. E. Watts\n1969)\n\n\nBoethius uses his view of eternity to address the problem of divine\nforeknowledge (see\n section 6.2).\n If God knows beforehand what we will do then how can we act freely?\nHis answer is that this problem dissolves in the face of the fact that\nGod does not know anything beforehand but has an immediate, atemporal\nknowledge of all things.\n\nIn Boethius, we find several analogies for timeless eternity. One is\nthat between timeless eternity and the centre of a circle. The thought\nis that the centre bears the same relation to any point on the\ncircumference of the circle, and in the same way timeless eternity\nbears the same relation to anything in time. (Aquinas develops this\nanalogy later.) Another analogy is that between God\u2019s timelessly\neternal vision and someone at the summit of a hill taking in at a\nglance what is taking place beneath her.\n\nAugustine connects God\u2019s timeless eternity to God\u2019s being\nthe cause of all times and God\u2019s immutability.\n\n\nWhat times existed which were not brought into being by you? Or how\ncould they pass if they never had existence? Since, therefore, you are\nthe cause of all times, if any time existed before you made heaven and\nearth, how can anyone say that you abstained from working? (Augustine,\nConfessions, XI. xiii (15)).\n\nIt is not in time that you precede times. Otherwise you would not\nprecede all times. In the sublimity of an eternity which is always in\nthe present, you are before all things past and transcend all things\nfuture, because they are still to come. (Augustine,\nConfessions, XI. xiii (16)).\n\nIn you it is not one thing to be and another to live: the supreme\ndegree of being and the supreme degree of life are one and the same\nthing. You are being in a supreme degree and are immutable. In you the\npresent day has no ending, and yet in you it has its end: \u201call\nthese things have their being in you\u201d (Rom.11.36). They would\nhave no way of passing away unless you set a limit to them. Because\n\u201cyour years do not fail\u201d (Ps.101.28), your years are one\nToday. (Augustine, Confessions, I. vi (10))\n\n",
