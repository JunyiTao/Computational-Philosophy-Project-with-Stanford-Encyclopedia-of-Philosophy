    "main_text": "The Reception of Deleuze || The feminist critique\n6.1 The feminist critique\n\nAn early wave of criticism was directed in the 1980s at\nDeleuze\u2019s collaborations with Guattari by feminists such as\nAlice Jardine and Luce Irigaray. Jardine 1985 criticized the concept\nof \u201cbecoming-woman\u201d in A Thousand Plateaus, which\nDeleuze and Guattari position as the first step towards a\nde-subjectivizing \u201cbecoming-indiscernible.\u201d Jardine argued\nthat Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s claim that even women must undergo a\n\u201cbecoming-woman\u201d amounts to a threat to the hard-fought\nvictories of concrete feminist struggle that allowed women to claim a\nsubjectivity in the first place. According to Grosz 1994\u2019s\nsurvey of the early feminist critiques, Irigaray argued that the use\nof \u201cbecoming-woman\u201d as a figure of change incumbent upon\nall, including men, amounts to a masculinist and desexualizing\nappropriation of feminist struggle. In the 1990s and now into the\n2000s, a number of feminists associated with the \u201ccorporeal\nfeminism\u201d movement have attempted positive connections with\nDeleuze in the name of an open and experimental attitude toward bodily\npotentials, in both the singular and political registers, as in the\nphrase \u201cbody politic.\u201d See among others Braidotti 1994 and\n2002; Gatens 1996; Grosz 1994 and 1995; Olkowski 1999; Lorraine 1999;\nand the essays in Buchanan and Colebrook 2002.\n",
