    "main_text": "The Origin of Languages\n2. The Origin of Languages\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b describes how a language develops within a\ncommunity. In [Letters] (114, 115) 134.16\u2013135.14 he\npictures a community whose members have concepts\n(ma\u2018q\u016bl\u0101t, literally \u201cintellected\nthings\u201d, or \u201cintelligibles\u201d in Scholastic\nterminology) that allow them to pick out identifiable objects in the\nexternal world, either individually or as kinds of thing. He refers to\nthese concepts drawn from perception of the external world as\n\u201cprimary concepts\u201d. These people have beliefs, and they\nare able to reason about the world, to deliberate about their actions,\nand to communicate by pointing. But as yet these people have no\nlanguage.\n\nThe first development towards language is that the people come to\nrealize that they can communicate their needs to each other better if\nthey agree to label some objects and concepts with vocal sounds. This\nsets up a conventional correlation between simple (i.e., uncompounded)\nprimary concepts and words, and eventually this correlation comes to\nbe accepted by the whole community. The words are said to\n\u201csignify\u201d the concepts to which they are correlated.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b envisages that a lawmaker will regulate the\ncorrelation and add some words to it for the benefit of the community\n([Letters] (120) 138.4\u20138). Thus a national lexicon is\ncreated; the sounds that are used form a national alphabet. \n\nOnce the idea has become established that words signify meanings, the\ncommunity will aim to develop the language so that words imitate the\n\u201cordering\u201d or \u201cregime\u201d\n(inti\u1e93\u0101m) of the primary concepts\n([Letters] (122) 139.2\u20134). This regime includes any\nrelationships that the concepts have as concepts. For example, two\nconcepts may be similar; so an effort will be made to find a pair of\nsimilar words to express these concepts. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nnotes that this effort may misfire and result in homonymy\u2014a\nsingle word being used for two different concepts ([Letters]\n(124) 140.8\u201310). The pressure to copy similarities also leads to\nmetaphors ([Letters] (127) 141.10).\n\nAlso some concepts are derived from others; the word for the derived\nconcept should be grammatically derived from the word for the other\nconcept. The words for underived concepts should not be grammatically\nderived. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b notes that in practice this\ncorrelation sometimes fails. For example, he takes it that the\nparticiple \u201cliving\u201d (\u1e25ayy) is derived, but\nit is sometimes used to signify the underived concept\n\u201canimal\u201d ([Letters] (26) 74.16, (36) 81.18f).\nLikewise the underived concept \u201cis\u201d is sometimes signified\nby the derived passive participle mawj\u016bd\n([Letters] (84) 113.9).\n\nAlso concepts can be combined into compound concepts, and this\npossibility will be copied in the language too. ([Letters]\n(126) 140.20\u2013141.3.) Taking this view, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nmakes a number of remarks that contain the first explicit formulations\nof the thesis of\n compositionality.[6]\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b clearly believes that mismatches between\nwords and concepts are a bad thing, but it\u2019s less clear why he\nbelieves this, or what he thinks should be done about it. The original\nmatching was set up by an artless consensus of the community,\npresumably because it served some social purpose.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b never analyses in detail what this purpose\nmight be, or, for example, how it would be damaged by using derived\nwords for underived concepts. Does he really fear that a mismatch\ncould lead to a breakdown in communication, even if the whole\ncommunity adopts the mismatch? Germann (2015/6: 138f) has suggested\nthat his fear is more specific: he worries that if mismatches develop,\nteachers\u2014including philosophy teachers\u2014may be unable to\npass information reliably to their students. \n\nAnother possibility is that he is afraid that a mismatch will cause\nerrors in logical reasoning, because the relationships between\nconcepts that make an argument valid will not be visible in the\ncorresponding words. In [Expressions] 102.8\u201315, after\ntelling us that demonstrations and syllogisms take place in internal\nspeech, not external, he comments that\n\n\nmost students don\u2019t have the ability to imagine how concepts are\nordered in the mind, so instead one takes expressions that signify the\nconcepts, so as to enable the student\u2019s mind to make a\ntransition from them to the concepts. \n\n\nAny mismatch between concepts and words could disrupt this process.\n\n\nIn any event, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b is in no hurry to reform the\nlanguage. He is content to continue using the word\nmawj\u016bd for \u201cis\u201d. \n\nThere is one part of the regime of primary concepts that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b never suggests that language should\nreplicate. Some concepts are more inclusive than others; for example,\n\u201canimal\u201d is more inclusive than \u201chuman\u201d.\nFollowing one reading of Aristotle, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b believes\nthat there are ten maximally inclusive simple primary concepts\n(ignoring \u201cthing\u201d, \u201cconcept\u201d,\n\u201cone\u201d, and \u201cbeing\u201d which include all\nconcepts). He refers to these ten concepts as \u201ccategories\u201d\n(maq\u016bl\u0101t, not to be confused with\nma\u2018q\u016bl\u0101t above). But we will prefer to call\nthem by their alternative name \u201csupreme genera\u201d, because\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b confusingly also applies the name\n\u201ccategory\u201d to all simple primary concepts. Languages do\ndistinguish the minimally inclusive concepts, those that apply to just\none thing, by using proper names for them. But it\u2019s unrealistic\nto expect languages to copy the rest of this regime of inclusions, and\nwe know of no place where al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b suggests that it\nshould.\n\nSome of the historical processes mentioned above will have the effect\nof making people think about the primary concepts and their regime.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b points out that as a result, people will now\nhave concepts that classify concepts in the soul rather than\nidentifiable objects in the external world. So these are a new kind of\nconcept, and al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b calls them \u201csecondary\nconcepts\u201d (often translated as \u201csecond\nintelligibles\u201d). Thinking about secondary concepts will give us\n\u201ctertiary concepts\u201d, and so on to infinity. As examples of\nsecondary concepts, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b mentions\n\u201cgenus\u201d, \u201cspecies\u201d, \u201cmore/less\ninclusive\u201d, \u201cknown\u201d, \u201cconcept\u201d. (All\nthis is in [Letters] (7,8)\n 64.9\u201365.8.)[7]\n\nAlthough al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b doesn\u2019t recommend any\nparticular reforms of language, he does make some detailed\nrecommendations for a philosopher who is seeking to translate\nphilosophy from another language and needs to introduce technical\nterms for the purpose. ([Letters] (155) 157.19\u2013158.21.)\nIt would be interesting to compare al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nrecommendations with his own practice, if we could be sure which of\nthe technical terms used for translating Greek writers we can credit\nto him. \n\nHe does introduce some new names for notions that he himself\npioneered. Three noteworthy examples are: \n\n He introduces yuf\u012bdu \u201cprovides\u201d as a\nterm of art for saying that the answer to a question posed in a\nphilosophical debate \u201cprovides\u201d information (cf.\n Section 4\n below). The root is rare in his writings except for this usage, and\nits use in a related sense in linguistic writers probably antedates\nhis use of it (see Giolfo & Hodges 2018). \n He borrows from the linguists the term\nistithn\u0101\u2019 (\u201cexception\u201d) as a name for\nthe inference rules of his hypothetical logic (cf.\n Section 6 below).\n The choice rests on a formal similarity between these rules and a\nproperty of the syntactic construction known as\n \u201cexception\u201d.[8]\n\n His choice of the name \u201csecondary concept\u201d is based\non an analogy with Porphyry\u2019s theory of \u201csecond\nimpositions\u201d, i.e., words for talking about\n words.[9]\n\n",
