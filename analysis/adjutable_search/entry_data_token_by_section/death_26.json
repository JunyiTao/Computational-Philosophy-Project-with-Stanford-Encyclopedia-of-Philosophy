    "main_text": "Never Dying || Never Dying Would be Good\n7.1 Never Dying Would be Good\n\nIn \u201cDeath\u201d (and in The View From Nowhere, p. 224)\nNagel argues that no matter when it happens, dying is bad for those\nwho die. He bases this view on the claim that \u201clife is worth\nliving even when the bad elements of experience are plentiful and the\ngood ones too meager to outweigh the bad ones on their own. The\nadditional positive weight is supplied by experience itself, rather\nthan by any of its contents.\u201d (1970, p. 60) Nagel\u2019s view\nappears to be that it is intrinsically good for us to experience\nthings, and that this good is great enough to outweigh any evils that\naccompany it. Hence a person\u2019s welfare level is positive at any\ntime when she is experiencing things, and no matter how much misery\ncontinued existence will bring her, it is overall good for her to live\nlonger, assuming that she continues to experience things. (Nagel does\nnot argue that being deprived of continued life would be a misfortune\nif that life were entirely devoid of experience.)\n\nNagel considers objections to his view towards the end of his essay.\nOne might argue, Nagel points out (as noted earlier), that mortality\nis not a misfortune on the grounds that the nonrealization of remote\npossibilities (like being immortal) is not harmful, or on the grounds\nthat limitations that are normal to the species (like mortality) are\nnot harmful. He responds that the normality and inevitableness of\ndeath \u201cdo not imply that it would not be good to live\nlonger.\u201d Whenever death comes, it would have been good to live\nlonger, so it is bad for us that we will not: \u201cif there is no\nlimit to the amount of life that it would be good to have, then it may\nbe that a bad end is in store for us all.\u201d (1970, p. 69)\n\nNagel\u2019s case for saying that death is always bad for those who\ndie rests on his claim that the goodness of experiencing outweighs any\naccompanying evils. However, the latter is implausible, as is evident\nto anyone who would rather be sedated into unconsciousness than\nundergo the suffering she would otherwise experience during surgery.\nUnder such circumstances, sedation is overall good for us, despite the\nfact that (indeed: because) it stops us from experiencing things for a\ntime. And once this is acknowledged, it seems reasonable to add that,\nunder certain circumstances, dying would be overall good for us, and\nhence not bad for us after all. It would be overall good for us if the\nfurther life we otherwise would have would bring us great evils, such\nas suffering, that are not offset by goods.\n",
