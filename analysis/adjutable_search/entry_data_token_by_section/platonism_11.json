    "main_text": "The Singular Term Argument || Fictional Objects\n5. The Epistemological Argument Against Platonism\n\nOver the years, anti-platonist philosophers have presented a number of\narguments against platonism. One of these arguments stands out as the\nstrongest, namely, the epistemological argument. This argument goes\nall the way back to Plato, but it has received renewed interest since\n1973, when Paul Benacerraf presented a version of the argument. Most\nof the work on this problem has taken place in the philosophy of\nmathematics, in connection with the platonistic view of mathematical\nobjects like numbers. We will therefore discuss the argument in this\ncontext, but all of the issues and arguments can be reproduced in\nconnection with other kinds of abstract objects. The argument can be\nput in the following way:\n\nHuman beings exist entirely within spacetime.\nIf there exist any abstract mathematical objects, then they do not\nexist in spacetime. Therefore, it seems very plausible that:\nIf there exist any abstract mathematical objects, then human\nbeings could not attain knowledge of them. Therefore,\nIf mathematical platonism is correct, then human beings could not\nattain mathematical knowledge.\nHuman beings have mathematical knowledge. Therefore,\nMathematical platonism is not correct.\n\n\nThe argument for (3) is everything here. If it can be established,\nthen so can (6), because (3) trivially entails (4), (5) is beyond\ndoubt, and (4) and (5) trivially entail (6). Now, (1) and (2) do not\nstrictly entail (3), and so there is room for platonists to maneuver\nhere \u2014 and as we'll see, this is precisely how most platonists\nhave responded. However, it is important to notice that (1) and (2)\nprovide a strong prima facie motivation for (3), because they\nseem to imply that mathematical objects (if there are such things) are\ntotally inaccessible to us, i.e., that information cannot pass from\nmathematical objects to human beings. But this gives rise to a\nprima facie worry (which may or may not be answerable) about\nwhether human beings could acquire knowledge of mathematical objects.\nThus, we should think of this argument not as refuting\nplatonism but as issuing a challenge to platonists. The challenge is\nsimply to explain how human beings could acquire knowledge of abstract\nmathematical objects.\n\nThere are three ways for platonists to respond. First, they can argue\nthat (1) is false and that the human mind is capable of somehow\nforging contact with abstract mathematical objects and thereby\nacquiring information about such objects. This strategy has been\npursued by Plato in The Meno and The Phaedo, and by\nG\u00f6del (1964). Plato's idea is that our immaterial souls acquired\nknowledge of abstract objects before we were born and that\nmathematical learning is really just a process of coming to remember\nwhat we knew before we were born. On G\u00f6del's version of the view,\nwe acquire knowledge of abstract objects in much the same way that we\nacquire knowledge of concrete physical objects; more specifically,\njust as we acquire information about physical objects via the faculty\nof sense perception, so we acquire information about abstract objects\nby means of a faculty of mathematical intuition. Now, other\nphilosophers have endorsed the idea that we possess a faculty of\nmathematical intuition, but G\u00f6del's version of this view \u2014\nand he seems to be alone in this \u2014 involves the idea that the\nmind is non-physical in some sense and that we are capable of forging\ncontact with, and acquiring information from, non-physical\nmathematical\n objects.[15]\n This view has been almost universally rejected. One problem is that\ndenying (1) doesn't seem to help. The idea of an immaterial mind\nreceiving information from an abstract object seems just as mysterious\nand confused as the idea of a physical brain receiving information\nfrom an abstract object.\n\nThe second strategy that platonists can pursue in responding to the\nepistemological argument is to argue that (2) is false and that human\nbeings can acquire information about mathematical objects via normal\nperceptual means. The early Maddy (1990) pursued this idea in\nconnection with set theory, claiming that sets of physical objects can\nbe taken to exist in spacetime and, hence, that we can perceive them.\nFor instance, on her view, if there are two books on a table, then the\nset containing these books exists on the table, in the same place that\nthe books exist, and we can see the set and acquire information about\nit in this way. This view has been subjected to much criticism,\nincluding arguments from the later Maddy (1997). Others to attack the\nview include Lavine (1992), Dieterle and Shapiro (1993), Balaguer\n(1998a), Milne (1994), Riskin (1994), and Carson (1996).\n\nIt may be objected that according to the definitions we've been using,\nviews like Maddy's are not versions of platonism at all, because they\ndo not take mathematical objects to exist outside of spacetime.\nNonetheless, there is some rationale for thinking of Maddy's view as a\nsort of non-traditional platonism. For since Maddy's view entails that\nthere is an infinity of sets associated with every ordinary physical\nobject, all sharing the same spatiotemporal location and the same\nphysical matter, she has to allow that these sets differ from one\nanother in some sort of non-physical way and, hence, that there is\nsomething about these sets that is non-physical, or perhaps abstract,\nin some sense of these terms. Now, of course, the question of whether\nMaddy's view counts as a version of platonism is purely\nterminological; but whatever we say about this, the view is still\nworth considering in the present context, because it is widely thought\nof as one of the available responses to the epistemological argument\nagainst platonism, and indeed, that is the spirit in which Maddy\noriginally presented the view.\n\nThe third and final strategy that platonists can pursue is to accept\n(1) and (2) and explain why (3) is nonetheless false. This strategy is\ndifferent from the first two in that it doesn't involve the\npostulation of an information-transferring contact between human\nbeings and abstract objects. The idea here is to grant that human\nbeings do not have such contact with abstract objects and to explain\nhow they can nonetheless acquire knowledge of such objects. This has\nbeen the most popular strategy among contemporary platonists. Its\nadvocates include Quine (1951, section 6), Steiner (1975, chapter 4),\nParsons (1980, 1994), Katz (1981, 1998), Resnik (1982, 1997), Wright\n(1983), Lewis (1986, section 2.4), Hale (1987), Shapiro (1989, 1997),\nBurgess (1990), Balaguer (1995, 1998a), Linsky and Zalta (1995),\nBurgess and Rosen (1997), and Linnebo (2006). There are several\ndifferent versions of this view; we will look very briefly at the most\nprominent of them.\n\nOne version of the third strategy, implicit in the writings of Quine\n(1951, section 6) and developed by Steiner (1975, chapter four,\nespecially section IV) and Resnik (1997, chapter 7), is to argue that\nwe have good reason to believe that our mathematical theories are\ntrue, even though we don't have any contact with mathematical objects,\nbecause (a) these theories are embedded in our empirical theories, and\n(b) these empirical theories (including their mathematical parts) have\nbeen confirmed by empirical evidence, and so (c) we have empirical\nevidence for believing that our mathematical theories are true and,\nhence, that abstract mathematical objects exist. Notice that this view\ninvolves the controversial thesis that confirmation is\nholistic, i.e., that entire theories are confirmed by pieces of\nevidence that seem to confirm only parts of theories. One might doubt\nthat confirmation is holistic in this way (see, e.g., Sober (1993),\nMaddy (1992), and Balaguer (1998a)). Moreover, even if one grants that\nconfirmation is holistic, one might worry that this view leaves\nunexplained the fact that mathematicians are capable of acquiring\nknowledge of their theories before these theories are applied in\nempirical science.\n\nA second version of the third strategy, developed by Katz (1981, 1998)\nand Lewis (1986, section 2.4), is to argue that we can know that our\nmathematical theories are true, without any sort of\ninformation-transferring contact with mathematical objects, because\nthese theories are necessarily true. The reason we need\ninformation-transferring contact with ordinary physical objects in\norder to know what they're like is that these objects could have been\ndifferent. For instance, we have to look at fire engines in order to\nknow that they're red, because they could have been blue. But we don't\nneed any contact with the number 4 in order to know that it is the sum\nof 3 and 1, because it is necessarily the sum of 3 and 1. (For\ncriticisms of this view, see Field (1989, pp. 233\u201338) and\nBalaguer (1998a, chapter 2, section 6.4).)\n\nA third version of the third strategy has been developed by Resnik\n(1997) and Shapiro (1997). Both of these philosophers endorse\n(platonistic) structuralism, a view that holds that our\nmathematical theories provide true descriptions of mathematical\nstructures, which, according to this view, are abstract. Moreover,\nResnik and Shapiro both claim that human beings can acquire knowledge\nof mathematical structures (without coming into any sort of\ninformation-transferring contact with such things) by simply\nconstructing mathematical axiom systems; for, they argue, axiom\nsystems provide implicit definitions of structures. One\nproblem with this view, however, is that it does not explain how we\ncould know which of the various axiom systems that we might formulate\nactually pick out structures that exist in the mathematical realm.\n\nA fourth and final version of the third strategy, developed\nindependently (and somewhat differently) by Balaguer (1995, 1998a) and\nLinsky & Zalta (1995), is based on the adoption of a particular\nversion of platonism called plenitudinous platonism (Balaguer\nalso calls it full-blooded platonism, or FBP, and Linsky and\nZalta call it principled platonism). Balaguer defines\nplenitudinous platonism (somewhat roughly) as the view that there\nexist mathematical objects of all possible kinds, or the view that all\nthe mathematical objects that possibly could exist actually do exist.\nBut, in general, Balaguer would define a different plenitude principle\nfor every different kind of abstract object. Linsky & Zalta\ndevelop plenitudinous platonism by proposing a distinctive plenitude\nprinciple for each of three basic domains of abstracta: abstract\nindividuals, relations (properties and propositions), and contingently\nnonconcrete individuals (1995, 554). For example, on their view, the\nplenitude principle for abstract individuals asserts (again, somewhat\nroughly) that every possible description of an object characterizes an\nabstract object that encodes \u2014 and, thus, in an important sense,\nhas \u2014 the properties expressed in the description. \n\nBalaguer and Linsky & Zalta then argue that if platonists endorse\nplenitudinous platonism, they can solve the epistemological problem\nwith platonism without positing any sort of information-transferring\ncontact between human beings and abstract objects. Balaguer's version\nof the argument proceeds as follows. Since plenitudinous platonism, or\nFBP, says that there are mathematical objects of all possible kinds,\nit follows that if FBP is true, then every purely mathematical theory\nthat could possibly be true (i.e., that's internally consistent)\naccurately describes some collection of actually existing mathematical\nobjects. Thus, it follows from FBP that in order to attain knowledge\nof abstract mathematical objects, all we have to do is come up with an\ninternally consistent purely mathematical theory (and know that it is\nconsistent). But it seems clear that (i) we humans are\ncapable of formulating internally consistent mathematical theories\n(and of knowing that they are internally consistent), and (ii) being\nable to do this does not require us to have any sort of\ninformation-transferring contact with the abstract objects that the\ntheories in question are about. Thus, if this is right, then the\nepistemological problem with platonism has been solved.\n\nOne might object here that in order for humans to acquire knowledge of\nabstract objects in this way, they would first need to know that\nplenitudinous platonism is true. Linsky & Zalta respond to this by\narguing that plenitudinous platonism (or in their lingo, principled\nplatonism) is knowable a priori because it is required for\nour understanding of any possible scientific theory: it alone is\ncapable of accounting for the mathematics that could be used in\nempirical science no matter what the physical world was like.\nBalaguer's response, on the other hand, is based on the claim that to\ndemand that platonists explain how humans could know that FBP is true\nis exactly analogous to demanding that external-world realists (i.e.,\nthose who believe that there is a real physical world, existing\nindependently of us and our thinking) explain how human beings could\nknow that there is an external world of a kind that gives rise to\naccurate sense perceptions. Thus, Balaguer argues that while there may\nbe some sort of Cartesian-style skeptical argument against FBP here\n(analogous to skeptical arguments against external-world realism), the\nargument in (1)\u2013(6) is supposed to be a different kind of\nargument, and in order to respond to that argument, FBP-ists do not\nhave to explain how humans could know that FBP is true.\n",
