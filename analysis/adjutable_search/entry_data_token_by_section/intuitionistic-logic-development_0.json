    "main_text": "Introduction || The Proof Interpretation\n1.1 The Proof Interpretation\n\nThe standard explanation of intuitionistic logic today is the\nBHK-Interpretation (for \u201cBrouwer, Heyting, Kolmogorov\u201d) or\nProof Interpretation as given by Troelstra and van Dalen in\nConstructivism in Mathematics (Troelstra & van Dalen\n1988: 9):\n\n(H1)A proof of \\(A\n\\wedge B\\) is given by presenting a proof of \\(A\\) and\na proof of \\(B\\).\n(H2)A proof of \\(A \\vee\nB\\) is given by presenting either a proof of \\(A\\) or a\nproof of \\(B\\) (plus the stipulation that we want to\nregard the proof presented as evidence for \\(A \\vee B\\)).\n(H3)A proof of \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\) is a construction which permits us to transform any\nproof of \\(A\\) into a proof of \\(B\\).\n(H4)Absurdity \\(\\bot\\)\n(contradiction) has no proof; a proof of \\(\\neg A\\) is a construction\nwhich transforms any hypothetical proof of \\(A\\) into a\nproof of a contradiction.\n(H5)A proof of\n\\(\\forall xA(x)\\) is a construction which transforms a proof of \\(d\n\\in D\\) (\\(D\\) the intended range of the variable\n\\(x)\\) into a proof of \\(A(d)\\).\n(H6)A proof of\n\\(\\exists xA(x)\\) is given by providing \\(d \\in D\\), and a proof of\n\\(A(d)\\).\n\n\nNotions such as \u201cconstruction\u201d, \u201cpresenting\u201d\nand \u201ctransformation\u201d can be understood in different ways,\nand indeed they have been. Similarly, there have been different ideas\nas to how one may justify that concrete instances of clauses H3 and H4\nindeed work for any (possibly hypothetical) proof of the antecedent.\nLogical principles that are valid on one understanding of these\nnotions may not be valid on another. As Troelstra and van Dalen\nindicate, it is even possible to understand these clauses in such a\nway that they validate the principles of classical logic (Troelstra\n& van Dalen 1988: 9, 32\u201333; see also Sundholm 2004 and Sato\n1997). In the context of the foundational programs of intuitionism and\nconstructivism, all notions are of course understood to be effective;\nbut even then there is room for differences of understanding. Such\ndifferences can have mathematical consequences. On some\nunderstandings, intuitionistic logic turns out formally to be a\nsubsystem of classical logic (namely, classical logic without the\nPrinciple of the Excluded Middle). But that is not the understanding\nof intuitionistic mathematicians, who, in analysis, have constructed\nintuitionistically valid instances of the schema \\(\\neg \\forall x(Px\n\\vee \\neg Px)\\), while classically there can be none (see the section\non\n Strong counterexamples and the Creating Subject (3.3),\n below).\n\nTroelstra and van Dalen specify that the clauses H1\u2013H6 go back\nto Heyting\u2019s explanation from 1934 (hence \u201cH\u201d).\nHeyting\u2019s aim had been to clarify the conception of logic in\nBrouwer\u2019s foundational program in mathematics, which would\nmotivate adding the following clause:\n\n(H0) A proof of an\natomic proposition \\(A\\) is given by presenting a\nmathematical construction in Brouwer\u2019s sense that makes \\(A\\)\ntrue.\n\n\nIndeed, as we will see, a version of the Proof Interpretation is\nimplicit already in Brouwer\u2019s early writings from 1907 and 1908,\nand was notably used by him in his proofs of the bar theorem from 1924\nand 1927, which predate Heyting\u2019s papers on logic. We will\ntherefore begin our account of the historical development of\nintuitionistic logic with Brouwer\u2019s ideas, and then show how,\nvia Heyting and others, the modern Proof Interpretation was arrived\nat.\n",
