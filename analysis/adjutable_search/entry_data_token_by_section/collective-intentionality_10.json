But by now it seems\nclear that analyses of collective intentionality provide significant\ncontributions to the study of social phenomena, and that they form an\nimportant part of the main projects of social ontology (for an\noverview see Hindriks 2018).\n\nTake the example of money (see Searle 1995: 1): there is an enormous\npractical difference between a blank piece of paper and a five-dollar\nbill, but what does this difference consist in? To this some authors,\nincluding Searle (1995, 2010) and Tuomela (2002), have replied that\nthe existence of money depends at least partly on collective\nintentional attitudes, or on a shared practice of treating certain\npieces of paper, and not others, as money. This mechanism, which\naccording to Searle (2010) involves the imposition of status functions\nand specific deontic structures, generalizes to the way communities\ncreate and maintain social institutions, to public offices,\nconventions and cultural sites (such as the Taj Mahal); collective\nattitudes such as collective acceptance seem to play an ineliminable\nrole in the constitution of such social and institutional facts. The\nprecise structure of collective acceptance, however, is not all that\nclear. While it is meant to play the role of both creating and\nmaintaining institutional facts\u2014it is by way of collective\nacceptance that we say that such-and-such is (or counts as) money and\nit is by way of collective acceptance that we acknowledge of\nsuch-and-such that it is (or counts as) money\u2014, it is not easy\nto see how an attitude, whether collective or not, can fulfill these\ntwo functions with opposing directions-of-fit (see Laitinen 2014).\n\nRegardless of these details, integrating a conception of collective\nintentionality into the study of collective phenomena, which encompass\ninstitutional phenomena, is promising for the following very\nfundamental reason. The central concern of the theory of\nintentionality is to grasp the unity of, or the interaction\nbetween, the natural and the mental. The central concern of the theory\nof collective intentionality is to grasp the connections and\ninteractions between the mental and the social. And this is how the\ntheory of collective intentionality can be viewed as part of an\nencompassing ontological project.\n\nOn a more confined terrain, the theory of collective intentionality\nraises and contributes to elaborating on several specific issues\nin social ontology. As noted in the previous subsection, the theory of\ngroup agency\u2014including the issue of whether collective entities\ncan count as subjects of intentional states\u2014poses questions\nabout the ontological status of groups and group agents, and it\ninvites reiterations of familiar discussions about reduction,\nsupervenience, constitution, and composition (and more). But the\ntheory of joint action, especially if it is viewed as involving\nquestions about the specific relations between cooperators or\nco-agents, already raises issues regarding the social identity of\npersons. And once intersubjective relations are cast against the\nbackground of joint projects and shared practices, the study of\ncollective intentionality enters a direct exchange with the analysis\nof recognition and recognitive attitudes (cf. Ik\u00e4heimo &\nLaitinen (eds.) 2011).\n",
