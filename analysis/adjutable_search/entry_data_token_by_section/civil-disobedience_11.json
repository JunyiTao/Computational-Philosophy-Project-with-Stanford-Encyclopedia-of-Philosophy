    "main_text": "Justification || The Problem of Disobedience\n3.1 The Problem of Disobedience\n\nPhilosophers have given many arguments in favor of the moral duty to\nobey the law (see entry on\n political obligation).\n Despite the many critiques of, and general skepticism toward,\narguments for the moral duty to obey the law, most prominently\nfollowing A. John Simmons (1979), theorists of civil disobedience have\ncontinued to conceive of the practice\u2019s illegality as a hurdle\nto surmount (see Lyons 1998 for an analysis of the endurance of such a\nproblematic assumption). They conceive of principled disobedience in\ngeneral as presumptively wrong because it violates political\nobligation, undermines the rule of law, and destabilizes society both\nthrough example, by signaling to others that anyone can disobey if\nthey feel the urge, and in principle, by expressing disrespect for\nlaw\u2019s authority. They contend that civil disobedience in\nparticular is presumptively wrong because of its anti-democratic\nnature. The agent who violates the outcomes of democratic\ndecision-making processes because she disapproves of them puts herself\nabove the law and threatens the legal and democratic order. Some see\nin it a violation of reciprocity, a kind of political\n\u201cblackmail\u201d and a sign of \u201cmoral\nself-indulgence\u201d and arrogance, insofar as a minority, whose\nviews didn\u2019t prevail, disregards democratic processes and\nimposes on the majority its own view of the good and just (C. Cohen\n1971, 138\u201345; Dworkin 1985, 112; Weinstock 2016, 709; for a\nresponse to the charge of \u2018epistemic arrogance\u2019, see\nHindkj\u00e6r Madsen 2021).\n\nRecent scholarship on civil disobedience has taken what may be dubbed\nan anarchist turn, as theorists tend to no longer approach\ncivil disobedience as presumptively wrong and in tension with\npolitical obligation. Although some theorists still defend the latter\n(Smith 2013), most start from skepticism vis-\u00e0-vis the moral\nduty to obey the law (Brownlee 2012; Celikates 2014, 2016). Others\ndefend a disjunctive moral duty to obey the law or disobey it civilly\n(Lefkowitz 2007); and still others argue that the grounds commonly\nused to support political obligation \u2013 the natural duty of\njustice, the principle of fairness, the Samaritan duty, and\nassociative obligations \u2013 yield duties to resist injustice,\nthrough civil and uncivil disobedience, under non-ideal circumstances,\nand that such duties should be considered among our political\nobligations (Delmas 2018a). Likewise, on a virtue-ethical account,\npolitical obligation can be understood as an obligation to respect\nrather than to obey the law, which can sometimes give rise to a duty\nto engage in civil disobedience (Moraro 2019, ch. 6).\n",
