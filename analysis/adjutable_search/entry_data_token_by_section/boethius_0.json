    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nAnicius Severinus Manlius Boethius was born into the Roman aristocracy\nc. 475\u20137 C.E.\u2014about the same time as the last Roman\nEmperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed (August 476). Boethius lived\nmost of his life under the rule of Theoderic, an Ostrogoth educated at\nConstantinople, who was happy to let the old families keep up their\ntraditions in Rome, while he wielded power in Ravenna.\nBoethius\u2019s privileged social position ensured that he was taught\nGreek thoroughly and, though it is unlikely that he travelled to\nAthens or Alexandria, the sites of the two remaining (Platonic)\nphilosophical schools, he was certainly acquainted with a good deal of\nthe work which had been going on there. He was able to spend most of\nhis life in learned leisure, pursuing his vast project of translating\nand commenting philosophical texts. The Roman aristocracy was, by his\nday, thoroughly Christianized, and Boethius also became involved in\nsome of the ecclesiastical disputes of his time, centring mainly\naround a schism between the Latin and the Greek Churches which was\nresolved shortly before his death.\n\nBoethius\u2019s final years are well known to anyone who has read his\nmost popular work, the Consolation of Philosophy. He agreed\nto become Theoderic\u2019s \u2018Master of Offices\u2019, one of\nthe most senior officials, but he quickly fell out with many others at\ncourt, probably because he attacked their corruption. Accused of\ntreason and of engaging in magic, he was imprisoned and (probably in\n526) executed, but not before he had the chance to write his literary\nmasterpiece.\n\nThe Consolation of Philosophy, a prosimetrum (a prose work\nwith verse interludes) which recounts, in polished literary language,\nan imagined dialogue between the prisoner Boethius and a lady who\npersonifies Philosophy, contrasts with the rest of Boethius\u2019s\noeuvre. Besides writing text-books on arithmetic and\ngeometry, closely based on Greek models, Boethius devoted himself to\ntranslating Aristotle\u2019s logic and commenting on it; he produced\na commentary on the Categories and two each on On\nInterpretation and on the Isagoge\n(\u2018Introduction\u2019) by Porphyry, which had become a standard\npart of the logical curriculum. He also composed logical text-books on\ndivision, categorical syllogisms, and on two branches of logic which\nwill require further explanation (see below,\n Section 3):\n hypothetical syllogisms and topical reasoning (along with a\ncommentary on Cicero\u2019s Topics). In three of his four\nTheological Treatises (often known as the Opuscula\nsacra), I, II and V, Boethius uses his logical equipment to\ntackle problems of Christian doctrine; IV, however, is a\nstraightforward statement of Christian doctrine, a sort of confession\nof faith; whilst III is a brief, not specifically Christian\nphilosophical treatise.\n",
