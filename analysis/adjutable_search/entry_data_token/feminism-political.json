Traditional political philosophy largely sidelined\nand excluded the private sphere and civil society from political\ntheorizing, the very realms in which women were largely sequestered.\nIt focused instead on matters of state and governance. The rise of\nliberalism since the seventeenth century abetted this tendency by\ndrawing a sharp line between the public and the private realms. What\nhappened in the household, it held, were not matters of political\nconcern. Today, thanks largely to feminist interventions, political\nphilosophy is a far richer field of philosophical inquiry. It\nunderstands power and governance much more broadly.\n\nIn its own right, feminist political philosophy is a branch of both\nfeminist philosophy and political philosophy. As a branch of feminist\nphilosophy, it serves as a form of critique or a hermeneutics of\nsuspicion (Ric\u0153ur 1970). That is, it serves as a way of opening\nup or looking at the political world as it is usually understood and\nuncovering ways in which women and their current and historical\nconcerns are poorly depicted, represented, and addressed. As a branch\nof political philosophy, feminist political philosophy serves as a\nfield for developing new ideals, practices, and justifications for how\npolitical institutions and practices should be organized and\nreconstructed. Indeed, the feminist refrain that \u201cthe personal\nis political\u201d speaks to the fact that feminist political\nphilosophy is not only concerned with concepts that have always been\nmainstays in political philosophy (e.g., justice, equality, freedom),\nbut with redefining and expanding what is considered\n\u201cpolitical\u201d in the first place (e.g., the family, the\nworkplace, reproduction; Hirschmann 2007). In this sense, feminist\npolitical philosophy may be the paradigmatic branch of feminist\nphilosophy.\n\nWhile feminist philosophy has been instrumental in critiquing and\nreconstructing many branches of philosophy, from aesthetics to\nphilosophy of science, feminist political philosophy is also\nparadigmatic because it best exemplifies the point of feminist theory,\nwhich is, to borrow a phrase from Marx, not only to understand the\nworld but to change it (Marx 1845). And, though other fields have\neffects that may change the world, feminist political philosophy\nfocuses most directly on understanding ways in which collective life\ncan be improved. This project involves understanding the ways in which\npower emerges and is used or misused in public life (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on power).\n As with other kinds of feminist theory, common themes have emerged\nfor discussion and critique, but there has been little in the way of\nconsensus among feminist theorists on what is the best way to\nunderstand them. This introductory article lays out the areas of\nconcern that have occupied this vibrant field of philosophy for the\npast forty years. It understands feminist philosophy broadly to\ninclude work conducted by feminist theorists doing this philosophical\nwork from other disciplines, especially political science but also\nanthropology, comparative literature, law, and other programs in the\nhumanities and social sciences.\n", "toc": [{"#HistContDeve": "1.

Historical Context and Developments\n\nHistorically, political philosophy focused on the state and various\nforms of governance. It largely ignored other realms as outside the\nscope of the political. In general, political thought presumed that\npolitical actors were necessarily male and that politics was a\nmasculine enterprise (Okin 1979). It sharply distinguished the public\nrealm of the state from the purportedly non-political realms of civil\nsociety and the household, hence forgoing any serious scrutiny of\nrelations of domination in the private sphere. It presumed that women\nwere naturally inferior to men and lacked the capacity to rule\nthemselves. Hence traditional political thought deemed that it was\nappropriate for them to be ruled by their fathers or husbands, all in\nthe sanctity of the home, immune from public scrutiny. These\npresuppositions went largely unremarked upon until some women began to\ndemand the same \u201cuniversal\u201d human dignity that men were\nproclaiming in newly republican and democratic states of the\neighteenth century (Gouges 1791). The first feminist\ntheorists\u2014avant la lettre of feminism\u2014began\nquestioning the tenets of political thought not as an abstract\nexercise but out of their very real, lived experience. As feminist\nactivists and theorists entered the fray, they quickly pointed out how\nmany of political theory\u2019s presuppositions were thoroughly\ngendered. Over millennia, feminists noted, political thought coded the\npublic realm as masculine and the private one as feminine; there was\nthe public world of men\u2019s work and the private domain of\nwomen\u2019s labor. Political claims of universality were usually\nquite particular: for men alone.\n\nAs they did this work, drawing on their own experience, feminist\npolitical thinkers began creating new philosophical concepts. Early\nfeminist thinkers pointed out how social conditions (such as the lack\nof education) diminished women\u2019s capacities. Later, other\ntheorists pointed to the ways that women and their concerns were\nexcluded or sidelined. Already in the nineteenth century they were\nnoticing how people are socially constituted. By the mid-twentieth\ncentury, again drawing from their experience and collective\n\u201cconsciousness-raising\u201d groups, they began challenging\nnorms that countenanced women being harassed on the street by catcalls\nand whistles. They created new concepts like \u201csexual\nharassment\u201d and \u201cobjectification\u201d. Over time\nfeminist political philosophers began to notice deeper metaphysical\npresuppositions underlying gender divisions and to comment on how\nphilosophy had long construed such fundamental concepts as reason,\nuniversality, and nature in thoroughly gendered and hence suspect\nways. In doing this work, feminist philosophers began to transform the\nfield of political philosophy itself, moving it from its narrow focus\non governance to a broader focus on philosophical questions of\nidentity, essence, equity, difference, justice, and the good life.\n\nIn the European and U.S. context, earlier generations of feminist\nscholarship and activism, including the first wave of feminism in the\nEnglish-speaking world from the 1840s to the 1920s, focused on\nimproving the political, educational, and economic system primarily\nfor middle-class white women. Its greatest achievements were to\ndevelop a language of equal rights for women and to garner women the\nright to vote. Beginning in the 1960s, second wave feminists made\nfurther interventions in political theory by drawing on the language\nof the civil rights movements (e.g., the language of liberation) and\non a new feminist consciousness that emerged through women\u2019s\nsolidarity movements and new forms of reflection that uncovered sexist\nattitudes and impediments throughout the whole of society.\n\nThese advances opened up new questions, namely: is there anything that\nunites women across cultures, time, and contexts? Just as Marxist\ntheory sought out a universal subject in the person of the worker,\nfeminists theorists sought out a commonality that united women across\ncultures, someone for whom feminist theory could speak. No sooner had\nthat question been posed than it got taken down, as in the title of a\npaper co-written by the Latina feminist philosopher Mar\u00eda\nLugones and the white philosopher Elizabeth Spelman: \u201cHave We\nGot A Theory For You: Feminist Theory, Cultural Imperialism, and the\nDemand for \u2018The Woman\u2019s Voice\u201d (1986). This notion\nof a universal womanhood was also interrupted by other thinkers, such\nas bell hooks, saying that it excluded non-white and non-middle-class\nwomen\u2019s experience and concerns. Hooks\u2019 1981 book titled\nAin\u2019t I a Woman? exposed mainstream feminism as a\nmovement of a small group of middle- and upper-class white women whose\nexperience was very particular, hardly universal. The work of Lugones,\nSpelman, hooks and also Cherr\u00ede Moraga, Gloria Anzald\u00faa,\nAudre Lorde, and others foregrounded the need to account for\nwomen\u2019s multiple and complex identities and experiences. By the\n1990s the debates about whether there was a coherent concept of woman\nthat could underlie feminist politics was further challenged by\nnon-Western women challenging the Western women\u2019s movement as\ncaught up in Eurocentric ideals that led to the colonization and\ndomination of \u201cThird World\u201d people. What is now known as\npostcolonial and decolonial theories further heighten the debate\nbetween feminists who wanted to identify a universal feminist subject\nof woman (e.g., Okin, Nussbaum, and Ackerly) and those who call for\nrecognizing multiplicity, diversity, and intersectionality (e.g.,\nSpivak, Narayan, Mahmood, and Jaggar).\n\nAs a branch of political philosophy, feminist political philosophy has\noften mirrored the various divisions at work in political philosophy\nmore broadly. Prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the\nCold War, political philosophy was usually divided into categories\nsuch as liberal, conservative, socialist, and Marxist. Except for\nconservatism, for each category there were often feminists working and\ncritiquing alongside it. Hence, as Alison Jaggar\u2019s classic text,\nFeminist Politics and Human Nature, spelled out, each\nideological approach drew feminist scholars who would both take their\ncue from and borrow the language of a particular ideology (Jaggar\n1983). Jaggar\u2019s text grouped feminist political philosophy into\nfour camps: liberal feminism, socialist feminism, Marxist feminism,\nand radical feminism. The first three groups followed the lines of\nCold War global political divisions: American liberalism, European\nsocialism, and a revolutionary communism (though few in the west would\nembrace Soviet-style communism). Radical feminism was the most rooted\nin specifically feminist approaches and activism, developing its own\npolitical vocabulary with its roots in the deep criticisms of\npatriarchy that feminist consciousness had produced in its first and\nsecond waves. Otherwise, feminist political philosophy largely\nfollowed the lines of traditional political philosophy. But this has\nnever been an uncritical following. As a field bent on changing the\nworld, even liberal feminist theorists tended to criticize liberalism\nas much or more than they embraced it, and to embrace socialism and\nother more radical points of view more than to reject them. Still, on\nthe whole, these theorists generally operated within the language and\nframework of their chosen approach to political philosophy.\n\nPolitical philosophy began to change enormously in the late 1980s,\njust before the end of the Cold War, with a new invocation of an old\nHegelian category: civil society, an arena of political life\nintermediate between the state and the household. This was the arena\nof associations, churches, labor unions, book clubs, choral societies\nand manifold other nongovernmental yet still public organizations. In\nthe 1980s political theorists began to turn their focus from the state\nto this intermediate realm, which suddenly took center stage in\nEastern Europe in organizations that challenged the power of the state\nand ultimately led to the downfall of communist regimes. It also\nopened up more avenues, beyond the state, for feminist political\ntheorizing.\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, political philosophy along with\npolitical life radically realigned. New attention focused on civil\nsociety and the public sphere, especially with the timely translation\nof J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s early work, the Structural\nTransformation of the Public Sphere (Habermas 1962 [1989]).\nVolumes soon appeared on civil society and the public sphere, focusing\non the ways that people organized themselves and developed public\npower rather than on the ways that the state garnered and exerted its\npower. In fact, there arose a sense that the public sphere ultimately\nmight exert more power than the state, at least in the fundamental way\nin which public will is formed and serves to legitimate\u2014or\nnot\u2014state power. In the latter respect, John Rawls\u2019s work\nwas influential by developing a theory of justice that tied the\nlegitimacy of institutions to the normative judgments that a\nreflective and deliberative people might make (Rawls 1971). By the\nearly 1990s, Marxists seemed to have disappeared or at least become\nvery circumspect (though the downfall of communist regimes\nneedn\u2019t have had any effect on Marxist analysis proper, which\nnever subscribed to Leninist or Maoist thought). Socialists also\nretreated or transformed themselves into \u201cradical\ndemocrats\u201d (Mouffe [ed.] 1992a, 1993, 2000).\n\nNow the old schema of liberal, radical, socialist, and Marxist\nfeminisms were much less relevant. There were fewer debates about what\nkind of state organization and economic structure would be better for\nwomen and more debates about the value of the private sphere of the\nhousehold and the nongovernmental space of associations. Along with\npolitical philosophy more broadly, more feminist political\nphilosophers began to turn to the meaning and interpretation of civil\nsociety, the public sphere, and democracy itself. At this point in the\nearly 1990s new work in political theory turning to civil society\nconverged with feminist political theory that was rendering\n\u201cpolitical\u201d realms that heretofore had been excluded from\nmainstream political theory. A synergy arose between those studying\ncommunitarianisms and feminists working in an ethics-of-care\ntradition: both pointed to how particular care relations and communal\nties were as or more important than abstract principles of justice.\nThey also began to question the binary and hierarchical divisions of\njustice over care, universality over particularity, and the right over\nthe good, all metaphysical suppositions that were hardly neutral.\n2. Contemporary Approaches and Debates\n\nPolitical philosophy today is significantly more interesting, complex,\nand capacious thanks to feminist interventions in the field. While the\nprevious section traces these interventions in broad terms, showing\nhow political philosophy has been transformed as a result, this\nsection will provide more detailed descriptions of some of the major\nsites of concern, debate, and critique animating feminist political\nphilosophy. Because feminist political philosophy is often\ndistinguished by its attention to the concrete realities shaping the\nlives of women, differences among women (cultural, social, economic,\nexperiential) drive the rich diversity of work being done in this\nfield, and difference itself is a major topic for theorizing\nwith respect to foundational concepts like justice, freedom, and\nequality. Thus, it is important to emphasize that there is no\none feminist perspective shaping work in feminist political\nphilosophy, but a rich variety of perspectives emerging from\nparticular contexts, histories, and traditions. They are sometimes in\ntension with each other.\n\nNow in the second decade of the twenty-first century, feminist\ntheorists are doing an extraordinary variety of work on matters\npolitical and democratic that confront new and/or pressing challenges.\nSimilar developments in the areas of global ethics, public policy,\nhuman rights, disabilities studies, bioethics, climate change, and\ninternational development blur the distinction between theory and\npractice in philosophically generative ways.\n\nFor example, in global ethics there is a debate over whether there are\nuniversal values of justice and freedom that should be intentionally\ncultivated for women in the developing world or whether cultural\ndiversity should be prioritized. Feminist theorists have sought to\nanswer this question in a number of different and compelling ways.\n(For some examples see Ackerly 2000; Ackerly & Okin 1999; Benhabib\n2002 and 2006; Butler 2000; Gould 2004; Khader 2019; Abu-Lughod 2013;\nNussbaum 1999a; and Zerilli 2009; see also the entry on\n feminist perspectives on globalization.)\n\n\nModern abolitionist feminism is driven by the contributions of Black\nfeminist philosophers like Angela Davis (2003, 2005, 2016, and in\nDavis, Dent, Meiners, & Richie 2022), whose work on the racialized\nprison industrial complex has helped spur the social-political\nmovement to abolish prisons and develop new theories of restorative\njustice. Contemporary feminist theories of abolitionism have also\nbuilt on\n Michel Foucault\u2019s\n critique of the prison, generating new work on political resistance\nto social structures of incarceration, as well as new ways of\nexploring foundational political concepts like privacy, freedom, and\njustice (Pitts 2021b; Zurn & Dilts [ed.] 2016; Zurn 2021). (See\nalso Ruth Wilson Gilmore 2007 and 2022; Davis, Dent, Meiners, &\nRichie 2022; Guenther 2013; Montford & Taylor [eds] 2022.)\n\nThe work of feminist legal theorists (see the entry on\n feminist philosophy of law)\n has been transformative on both the theory and policy fronts. In her\n1989 article \u201cDemarginalizing the Intersection of Race and\nSex\u201d Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw critiqued\n\u201csingle-axis\u201d legal frameworks for failing to address\nrace- and gender-based discrimination occurring at the intersection of\nmultiple identities (Crenshaw 1989). Instead, she promoted an\nintersectional framework and, along with many others,\ndeveloped a theory of intersectionality as an analytic\nframework for understanding how compounded and intermeshed systems of\nprivilege and oppression structure experience (see also\n section 2.6\n below). Along with Crenshaw, Anita Allen (2011), Martha Fineman (2008\n[2011]), Catherine MacKinnon (1987, 1989), Mari J. Matsuda (1986,\n1996), and Patricia J. Williams (1991) are prominent legal scholars\nwhose work has made significant contributions to debates in feminist\npolitical philosophy.\n\nFeminists contributions in\n ethics and moral psychology\n that emphasize relations of care have also had a major impact on\npolitical philosophy. This intervention has challenged masculinist\ncharacterizations of political subjects as highly independent and\nrational, as well as core concepts within political philosophy (e.g.,\njustice, freedom, rights, sovereignty, and autonomy) derived from that\ncharacterization (see also\n section 2.5\n below).\n\nLikewise, new philosophical work on disabilities, as the entry on\n feminist perspectives on disability\n explains, is informed by a great deal of feminist theory, from\nstandpoint philosophy to feminist phenomenology and feminist care\nethics, as well as political philosophical questions of identity,\ndifference, and diversity (see also Kittay & Carlson [ed.] 2010).\nFeminist political philosophers like Martha Nussbaum (2006) have drawn\non the insights of philosophers of disability to offer new conceptions\nof justice (i.e., the capabilities approach).\n\nUltimately, the number of approaches that can be taken on any of these\nissues are as many as the number of philosophers there are working on\nthem. The remainder of this entry will outline a variety of approaches\nto central concerns in feminist political philosophy, noting general\nfamily resemblances among these approaches (i.e., liberal feminist,\nradical feminist, Marxist feminist, socialist feminist) and\nhighlighting new constellations that have emerged (e.g.,\nintersectional feminisms).\n2.1 Feminist Engagements with Liberalism and Neoliberalism\n\nLiberal feminism\n remains a strong current in feminist political thought. Following\nliberalism\u2019s focus on freedom and equality, liberal\nfeminism\u2019s primary concern is to protect and enhance\nwomen\u2019s personal and political autonomy, the first being the\nfreedom to live one\u2019s life as one chooses and the second being\nthe freedom to help decide the direction of the political community.\nThis follows from Enlightenment liberalism\u2019s core norm of equal\nrespect for personhood, where personhood is tied to moral equality, or\nthe equal worth of persons as moral choosers (Nussbaum 1999a). This\napproach was invigorated with the publication of John Rawls\u2019s\nA Theory of Justice (1971) and subsequently his Political\nLiberalism (1993). Susan Moller Okin (1989, 1979, 1999), Eva\nKittay (1999), Martha Nussbaum (2006), and Amy Baehr (2017) have used\nRawls\u2019s work productively to extend his theory to attend to\nwomen\u2019s concerns.\n\nPerhaps more than any other approach, liberal feminist theory\nparallels developments in liberal feminist activism. While feminist\nactivists have waged legal and political battles to criminalize, as\njust one example, violence against women (which previously, in marital\nrelations, hadn\u2019t been considered a crime), feminist political\nphilosophers who have engaged the liberal lexicon have shown how the\ndistinction between private and public realms has served to uphold\nmale domination of women by rendering power relations within the\nhousehold as \u201cnatural\u201d and immune from political\nregulation. Such political philosophy uncovers how seemingly innocuous\nand \u201ccommonsensical\u201d categories have covert power agendas.\nFor instance, Clare Chambers has critiqued the institution of\nmarriage, arguing that it violates liberal political principles of\nequality and liberty (Chambers 2017a). Feminist critiques of the\npublic/private split supported legal advances that finally led in the\n1980s to the criminalization in the United States of spousal rape\n(Sigler & Haygood 1988). Efforts to politicize the private sphere\nhave also challenged the capitalist economic system that relies on\nwomen\u2019s unpaid labor. As the entry on\n feminist perspectives on class and work\n explains, scholars like Silvia Federici have argued that\nwomen\u2019s unpaid housework and reproductive labor is essential to\nthe social reproduction of capitalism that exploits women. The\n\u201cwages for housework\u201d movement led by scholar-activists\nlike Federici is an attempt to demand remuneration for women\u2019s\nunpaid work (Federici 2012, 2021; more on this Marxist feminist\nlineage in\n section 2.3).\n Reproductive justice, pornography, and sex work are yet more issues\nof convergence for feminist proponents and critics of liberalism alike\n(see the section on Reproductive Rights in the entry on\n feminist philosophy of law;\n Altman & Watson 2019; Watson & Flanigan 2020). While the U.S.\nlegal tradition has typically grounded abortion rights in the right to\nprivacy, feminist political philosophers such as Shatema Threadcraft\n(2016) have understood reproductive justice as more fundamentally\nhaving to do with the freedom to choose one\u2019s destiny. As such,\nit is connected to the history of other struggles for race and gender\nequality in earlier eras.\n\nCarole Pateman and Charles Mills have worked within the liberal\ntradition to show the limits and faults of social contract theory, and\nEnlightenment liberalism more broadly, for women and people of color.\nTheir jointly authored book, Contract & Domination,\nlevels a devastating critique against systems of sexual and racial\ndomination. This work engages and critiques some of the most dominant\nstrains of political philosophy. Martha Nussbaum has defended\nliberalism from some of its critics, arguing that the most appealing\nversions of liberalism successfully avoid feminist criticisms that\nliberalism is overly individualistic, abstract, and rationalist\n(Nussbaum 1999a). She does however take seriously two deep and\nunresolved problems within liberalism \u201cexposed by feminist\nthinkers\u201d: (1) the fact of dependency and the need for care and\n(2) gender inequality and the family (Nussbaum 2004). With respect to\ndependency\u2014the reality of human dependency and thus the need for\ncare throughout the course of life\u2014Asha Bhandary (2020) has\ndeveloped a Rawlsian social contract framework to expose and address\nsystemic inequalities in who receives and provides care (see also\nBhandary & Baehr [eds] 2021 and\n section 2.5\n below). With respect to the second issue, which deals with the social\ninstitution of the family as a site of gender hierarchy and\noppression, Marxist, socialist, and materialist feminists have\nanalyzed the material conditions under which these social arrangements\n(the family and gender hierarchy) have developed. These feminists\ntypically critique liberalism for entrenching social arrangements\n(such as the public/private split and the system of wage labor) that\narise with capitalism and marginalize and disempower women as a social\ngroup (see\n section 2.3\n below).\n\nAs other feminist critics have argued, many of the central categories\nof liberalism occlude women\u2019s lived concerns. For example, the\nright to privacy coveted by classical liberals is a major source of\ncontention for feminists: the private realm, understood as a domain\nfree from state intervention, has historically been the domain where\nwomen and children have experienced the bulk of everyday forms of\noppression. The liberal private/public distinction sequesters the\nprivate sphere, and any harm that may occur there to women, away from\npolitical scrutiny (Pateman 1988). Other feminist critics note that\nliberalism continues to treat as unproblematic concepts that theorists\nin the 1990s and since have problematized, such as \u201cwoman\u201d\nas a stable and identifiable category and the univocity of the self\nunderlying self-rule or autonomy. Decolonial feminists like\nMar\u00eda Lugones have exposed the Eurocentric foundations of this\nview of the self (Lugones 2003; see also\n section 2.7).\n While Mari Matsuda develops a feminist critique of the methodological\nabstraction in liberal theories such as Rawls\u2019 A Theory of\nJustice (Matsuda 1986), others (such as Zerilli 2009) have argued\nthat the universal values that liberal feminists such as Okin\ninvoked were really expanded particulars, with liberal theorists\nmistaking their ethnocentrically derived values as universal ones. In\nthis vein, Falguni Sheth, focusing on the treatment of Muslim women in\nthe contemporary United States, argues that despite liberal claims to\nsecular neutrality, liberal states actively exclude and discriminate\nagainst racialized and marginalized populations (Sheth 2022).\n\nBeyond liberal feminism, contemporary feminist philosophers have led\nthe way in theorizing and critiquing what is known as neoliberalism,\nespecially the ways that neoliberal social and economic forces impact\nthe lives of women. On Wendy Brown\u2019s account (2015),\nneoliberalism refers to a set of relations between state, society, and\nsubjects that mimics and reinforces radical free-market ideals in the\neconomy. These forces, Brown argues, undermine liberal democratic\ncitizenship, public institutions, and popular sovereignty. Nancy\nFraser (2013), Jodi Dean (2009), Bonnie Honig (2017) and Judith Butler\n(2015) join Brown in asking whether democracy\u2014or \u201cthe\ndemos\u201d\u2014can be sustained under neoliberal conditions of\nrapidly increasing economic precariousness and diminishing social and\npolitical resources for resistance. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Anderson asks\nhow putatively positive values like \u201cwork ethic\u201d have\nbecome central to the moral and physical exploitation of workers under\nneoliberalism.\n2.2 Radical Feminism\n\nWhile feminist liberalism continues to flourish, the historical\ndevelopments and emerging debates described in the previous sections\nhave eclipsed or deeply transformed Jaggar\u2019s other three\ncategories of radical, Marxist, and socialist feminism (Jaggar 1983).\nThe \u201cgrand narratives\u201d that underlay the latter two have\nbecome less credible (Snyder 2008). Among theorists, radical feminism\nhas always been somewhat of a niche approach, likely because its\nstance is rather exacting. As the name \u201cradical\u201d suggests,\nradical feminists share the belief that existing structures and\ninstitutions need to be overhauled\u2014rather than\nreformed, as liberalism would have it\u2014in order to get\nat the \u201croot\u201d of women\u2019s oppression.\n\nThose who work in radical feminism continue to take issue with many of\nthe central tenets of liberal feminism, especially its focus on the\nindividual and the supposedly free choices that individuals can make.\nWhere the liberal sees the potential for freedom, the radical feminist\nsees structures of domination that are bigger than any individual. The\nidea that domination and oppression affect social groups in ways that\nare structural and systemic, though they may be\nexperienced differently by members of different social groups, is a\nmajor contribution of feminist political philosophy (Frye 1983; Young\n1990). Radical feminists remain committed to getting at the root of\nmale domination by understanding the source of power differentials,\nwhich some radical feminists, including Catharine MacKinnon, trace\nback to sexuality and the notion that heterosexual intercourse enacts\nmale domination over women.\n\n\nWomen and men are divided by gender, made into the sexes as we know\nthem, by the requirements of its dominant form, heterosexuality, which\ninstitutionalizes male sexual dominance and female sexual submission.\nIf this is true, sexuality is the linchpin of gender inequality.\n(MacKinnon 1989: 113)\n\n\nPatriarchy itself, according to this view, dominates women by\npositioning them as objects of men\u2019s desire (Welch 2015).\nRadical feminists of the 1980s tended to see power as running one-way,\nfrom those with power over those who are being oppressed. As Amy Allen\nputs it,\n\n\nUnlike liberal feminists, who view power as a positive social resource\nthat ought to be fairly distributed, and feminist phenomenologists,\nwho understand domination in terms of a tension between transcendence\nand immanence, radical feminists tend to understand power in terms of\ndyadic relations of dominance/subordination, often understood on\nanalogy with the relationship between master and slave. (2005:\n\u00a73.2)\n\n\nRadical feminists of the 1970s and 1980s sought to reject the\nprevailing order in various ways, sometimes advocating separatism\n(Daly 1973 [1985], 1978 [1990]), the technologization of procreation\n(and thus freeing women from their oppressive role in biological\nreproduction; Firestone 1970), or, as MacKinnon would have it,\nrejecting normative sexuality as rooted in male domination (MacKinnon\n1989). As Nancy Hirschmann notes, many radical feminists take biology\nas a \u201cfundamental starting point\u201d for theorizing\n(Hirschmann 2007: 146). This approach is generally recognized to be\nretrograde.\n\nA new generation of radical feminist theorists are renewing the\ntradition, showing how it has respected concerns such as\nintersectionality (Whisnant 2016) and shares some of the commitments\nof the postmodern feminists discussed below, e.g., skepticism about\nany fixed gender identity or gender binaries and a more fluid and\nperformative approach to sexuality and politics (Snyder 2008), as well\nas the ways that power and privilege continue to hold women back\n(Chambers 2017b: 656).\n2.3 Socialist, Marxist, and Materialist Feminisms\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, many political theorists in Europe,\nthe United States, and Latin America drew on socialist and Marxist\ntexts to develop theories of social change attentive to issues of\nclass relations and exploitation in modern capitalist economies. By\nand large, Marxist feminists focus on how modes of production, along\nwith changing relations of production and reproduction shape the\nsocial arrangements (e.g., the gender division of labor, gender\nhierarchy) and institutions (e.g., marriage, motherhood, the family)\nthat contribute to women\u2019s oppression. After learning of the\nhorrors of Stalinism, most Western Marxists and socialists, feminists\nincluded, were extremely critical of the communist systems in the\nSoviet Union and later in China. Western, mostly anti-communist,\nMarxist thought flourished in Italy (with Antonio Gramsci\u2019s\nwork), England (with Stuart Hall and Raymond Williams\u2019 work),\nFrance (with the Socialisme ou Barbarie group), and the\nUnited States (less so there after McCarthyism, yet renewed somewhat\nin the 1960s with the New Left). Jaggar\u2019s 1983 book summed up\nwell the way feminists were using socialist and Marxist ideas to\nunderstand the way women were exploited and their laboring and\nreproductive work devalued and unpaid though necessary for capitalism\nto function. Drawing on Frederick Engels\u2019 emphasis on the\n\u201creproduction of immediate life\u201d, Marxist and socialist\nfeminists were able to move beyond more orthodox readings of Marx that\nrestrict focus to modes of \u201cproduction\u201d that privilege the\nexperience of men as wage-laborers (Engels 1884: Preface). Social\nreproduction theorists instead analyze forms of labor, most often\nwomen\u2019s unpaid labor, that contribute to the maintenance of life\nat the individual, family, and species level (see Bhattacharya [ed.]\n2017; Federici 2004 and 2021; S. Ferguson 2019). In the entry on\n feminist perspectives on class and work,\n the authors point to much of the work that was going on in this field\nup through the mid-1990s. Since then, the authors note, various\npostmodern, postcolonial, poststructuralist, and deconstructive\ntheories have criticized the bases for socialist and Marxist thought,\nincluding the \u201cgrand narrative\u201d of economic determinism\nand the reduction of everything to economic and material relations.\nDespite this, Marxist analyses remain important to a variety of work\nbeing done in contemporary feminist political philosophy (see Dean\n2009; Delphy 1984; Federici 2004; Fraser 2009, 2022; Gago 2019 [2020];\nSpivak 1987; Vogel 1983).\n\nWhile the lineage and trajectory of materialist feminism (as distinct\nfrom Marxist or socialist feminism) is unclear (see Gimenez 2000),\nMarxist, Socialist, and materialist feminisms all share an attention\nto the concrete material conditions underlying existing social\narrangements (e.g., of gender hierarchy), the historically specific\nnature of these conditions, and a commitment to feminism as an\nemancipatory movement, not merely a scholarly endeavor. Meanwhile,\nfeminists associated with these schools of thought tend to diverge\nwhen it comes to which topics of analysis are taken up, which aspects\nof Marx\u2019s theory are considered pertinent for explaining\nwomen\u2019s oppression, and the relationship between feminism and\n(anti)capitalism (Gimenez 2000). While the categories of socialist and\nMarxist feminisms are less relevant today, materialist feminism is\nexperiencing something of a renaissance. While\n\u201cmaterialist\u201d can mean many things, as in the broader\nfocus on matter and the body animating the work of \u201cNew\nMaterialism\u201d (e.g., see Coole & Frost [ed.] 2010), for the\npurposes of this entry, \u201cmaterialist feminism\u201d has a\ndeeper and more explicit connection to the Marxist usage of the term\n\u201cmaterialism\u201d as described by Engels (and referenced\nabove):\n\n\nAccording to the materialist conception, the decisive element of\nhistory is pre-eminently the production and reproduction of life and\nits material requirements. This implies, on the one hand, the\nproduction of the means of existence (food, clothing, shelter and the\nnecessary tools); on the other hand, the generation of children, the\npropogation of the species. (Engels 1884 [trans. Untermann 1902],\nPreface).\n\n\nIn Martha Gimenez\u2019s view, the fact that materialist feminism has\nsomewhat displaced Marxist and socialist feminisms may have more to do\nwith the \u201cideological balance of power\u201d in politics,\nacademia, and publishing than the strength of feminist critiques of\nMarxism for its alleged economism and class reductionism (Gimenez\n2000: 25).\n\nSince the 1990s, the feminist concern with culture, identity, and\ndifference\u2014issues that were previously marginalized within\nmainstream white Anglo-American and French feminist theory and\nactivism\u2014increased, somewhat displacing Marxist and socialist\nfeminism\u2019s focus on systemic social forces and concrete material\nconditions. Certainly, new generations of materialist feminists and\ncritical theorists tend to be more friendly to postmodern theories of\nmeaning, identity, and subjectivity important in the field (see, for\nexample, Fraser 2009; Fraser & Jaeggi 2018; Amy Allen 2008; McAfee\n2008; and Young 2000) and classic works by philosophers like Angela\nDavis (Women, Race, and Class, 1981) demonstrate that\nconcerns about identity, culture, and difference are not incompatible\nwith Marxist feminist analysis.\n2.4 Poststructuralist Feminisms\n\nLike Marxist/materialist feminists who take seriously the role that\nsexual difference plays in systems of production and reproduction,\npoststructuralist feminists also take sexual difference seriously,\nattending to the ways in which language and meaning-systems structure\nexperience. Notable among them are the so-called French Feminists,\nnamely Cixous, Kristeva, and Irigaray. Of them all, Irigaray may have\nthe most developed political philosophy, including several books on\nthe rights that should be afforded to girls and women.\nIrigaray\u2019s early work (1974 [1985a] and 1977 [1985b]) made the\ncase that in the history of philosophy women have been denied their\nown essence or identity. Rather, they have been positioned as\nmen\u2019s mirror negation. So that to be a man is to not be a woman,\nand hence that woman equals only not-man. Her strategy in response to\nthis is to speak back from the margins to which women have been\nrelegated and to claim some kind of \u201cessence\u201d for women,\nand, along with that, a set of rights that are specifically for girls\nand women (Irigaray 1989 [1994] and 1992 [1996]). Criticisms of her\nviews have been heated, including among feminists themselves,\nespecially those who are wary of any kind of essentialist and\nbiological conflation of women\u2019s identity. To the extent that\nIrigaray is an essentialist, her view would be relegated to what is\nsometimes called symbolic difference feminism (Dietz 2003). However,\nthere are also compelling arguments that Irigaray is wielding\nessentialism strategically or metaphorically, that she isn\u2019t\nclaiming that women really do have some kind of irreducible essence\nthat the history of metaphysics has denied them (Fuss 1989). This\nother reading would put Irigaray more in the performative group\ndescribed below\n (section 2.8).\n The same kind of argument could be made for the work of Julia\nKristeva\u2014that her metaphors of the female chora, for example,\nare describing the Western imaginary, not any kind of womanly reality.\nSo whether French feminist thought should be grouped as difference\nfeminism or performative feminism is still very much open to\ndebate.\n\nTo the extent that the above two types of feminist theory are\npinpointing some kind of specific difference between the sexes, they\nraise concerns about essentialism or identifying distinct values that\nwomen have as women. Such concerns are part of a larger set of\ncriticisms that have run through feminist theorizing since the 1970s,\nwith non-white, non-middle-class, and non-western women questioning\nthe very category of \u201cwoman\u201d and the notion that this\ntitle could be a boundary-spanning category that could unite women of\nvarious walks of life. (See the entries on\n identity politics\n and\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender.)\n Criticisms of a unitary identity of \u201cwoman\u201d have been\nmotivated by worries that much feminist theory has originated from the\nstandpoint of a particular class of women who mistake their own\nparticular standpoint for a universal one. In her 1981 book,\nAin\u2019t I a Woman?: Black women and feminism, bell hooks\nnotes that the feminist movement pretends to speak for all women but\nwas made up of primarily white, middle class women who, because of\ntheir narrow perspective, did not represent the needs of poor women\nand women of color and ended up reinforcing class stereotypes (hooks\n1981). What is so damning about this kind of critique is that it\nmirrors the one that feminists have leveled against mainstream\npolitical theorists who have taken the particular category of men to\nbe a universal category of mankind, a schema that does not in fact\ninclude women under the category of mankind but marks them as other\n(Lloyd 1984 [1993]).\n\nThe question of subjectivity has been a particularly fertile one for\nfeminist political philosophy. Feminist politics and activism,\ninformed by poststructuralist and postcolonial critiques of the\nsubject, have spurred new work that seeks to understand what remains\nof the \u201cfeminist subject\u201d after critiques of essentialism\nand Eurocentrism (Butler 1995; Kramer 2017; Weeks 1998; Zerilli\n2005).\n2.5 Care, Vulnerability, Affect\n\nMany of the recent developments in feminist political philosophy have\nfollowed on the heels of feminist critiques or reinterpretations of\nthe Western philosophical canon. Earlier works by Wendy Brown (1988),\nAlison Jaggar (1989), Genevieve Lloyd (1984 [1993]), Susan Moller Okin\n(1979, 1989), Carole Pateman (1988, 1989), and others, revealed the\nmasculinist foundations of mainstream political theory. As Okin put\nit,\n\n\n[It] has proved to be no simple matter to integrate women into a\ntradition of theorizing created by, for, and about men. (Okin 1998:\n118)\n\n\nAs she goes on to say,\n\n\nGreat value has been placed on things traditionally associated with\nmen\u2014on the allegedly transcendent nonphysical realm, on\nexcessive individualism, on reason as all-important, and on the\nso-called manly virtues\u2014including competitiveness and\naggression. At the same time, the realm of things traditionally\nassociated with women\u2014concern with physical needs and\nnurturance, emotionality, cooperation (with other people and with\nnature)\u2014have been much more inclined to be denigrated. (Okin\n1998: 119)\n\n\nRather than attempting to align their theories with those values of\nindividualism, rationality, and abstraction associated with\nmasculinity (and classical liberalism), many feminist thinkers have\ninstead sought to revalue traditionally denigrated values associated\nwith femininity.\n\nA prime example is care ethics (see the discussion in the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n Drawing on Carol Gilligan\u2019s pathbreaking research in moral\npsychology (Gilligan 1982), which showed that the dominant conception\nof moral development and subjectivity was really a reflection of a\nparticular, masculine style of moral reasoning, feminist political\ntheorists challenged dominant conceptions of political\nsubjectivity, judgment, and action. Just as Gilligan and other\nfeminist ethicists emphasized that styles of moral reasoning\nassociated with women were not inferior because of their\ndistinctiveness from masculinist models\u2014and that distinctiveness\nincludes an emphasis on emotions like empathy and care, responsiveness\nto need, and an awareness of one\u2019s connection with others and\nthe natural world\u2014feminist political philosophers argued that\nways of looking at and organizing the world informed by care are not\ninferior or pathological. This spurred new approaches to theorizing\nfoundational political concepts that are at odds with liberal\npolitical theory in particular. First and foremost, political\ntheorists influenced by the care ethics tradition insist that\npolitical subjects are not independent, but fundamentally\n(inter)dependent, enmeshed in complex networks of relation\nnecessary for survival. This means that as political agents, we do not\nact on our own, but rely on others who are themselves dependent. This\ntransformed view of the self has both theoretical and practical\nimplications. From a care perspective, agency is relational, and\nindividuals are nonsovereign and heteronomous. Taking up insights\nabout our varied proximity to states of dependency throughout the\ncourse of life arising in the field of disability studies, thinkers\nlike Judith Butler have argued that vulnerability is both an enabling\nand constraining feature of our ontological condition and one that is\noften politically induced in particular populations, marking them as\n\u201cprecarious\u201d (Butler 2004, 2015). In her 2017 book The\nRight to Maim, Jasbir Puar draws on similar theoretical\napproaches in disability studies and biopolitics to analyze and\ncritique the ways that the liberal nation-state\n\u201cdebilitates\u201d populations in order to discipline and\ncontrol them (Puar 2017). This recent work marks an interest among\nfeminist political theorists in exposing the myriad ways that\ncontemporary liberal and neoliberal frameworks care-lessly intensify\nand/or manipulate vulnerability. Along with disability, these thinkers\nseek to expose the ways that gender, race, ethnicity, immigration\nstatus, and age are complexly enmeshed in these scenes of abandonment\n(see also Fineman 2008 [2011]; Fraser 2022; Povinelli 2011; Collins\n1990 [2000]). From a policy standpoint, care has also been front and\ncenter for feminist political thinkers, especially in the wake of the\nCOVID-19 global pandemic, which exposed the radical insufficiency of\nour infrastructures of care. The authors of The Care\nManifesto (known as \u201cThe Care Collective\u201d, 2020)\nexplore how we might reorganize our institutions and relationships to\nmeet the moment, including reclaiming public spaces, making healthcare\nfor all a reality, and taking action to protect the natural world.\n\nSome of the foundations and consequences of the care ethics approach\nhave also produced serious skepticism from feminist political\nphilosophers. First, there is the question of whether and, if so, how\nwomen-as-care-givers have distinct virtues. Feminists as a whole have\nlong distanced themselves from the idea that women have any particular\nessence, choosing instead to see femininity and its accompanying\nvirtues as social constructs, dispositions that result from culture\nand conditioning, not biological givens. So for care ethicists to\nchampion the virtues that have inculcated femininity seems also to\nchampion a patriarchal system that relegates one gender to the role of\ncaretaker. The care ethicists\u2019 answer to this problem has often\nbeen to flip the hierarchy. That is, to claim that the work of the\nhousehold is more meaningful and sustaining than the work of the\npolis. But critics, such as Drucilla Cornell, Mary Dietz, and Chantal\nMouffe, argue that such a revaluation keeps intact the dichotomy\nbetween the private and the public and the old association of\nwomen\u2019s work with childcare (Butler & Scott [eds.] 1992;\nPhillips [ed.] 1998: 386\u2013389).\n\nFeminist political theorists associated with the care tradition have\nexplored how the distinct values that arise from practices of care\nmight transform our political concepts, aims, and organizations. How\nmight those activities and values typically relegated to the private\nrealm provide an alternative to the traditional emphases in moral and\npolitical philosophy on impartiality, rationality, and universal\nprinciples of justice in the public realm? The care approach\nchallenged the default to abstract principles in political philosophy,\nleading to intense debates between liberals who advocated universal\nideals of justice and care ethicists who advocated attention to the\nparticular, to relationships, to care. In Gilligan\u2019s early work,\nfor instance, the care approach is presented as opposed to\nwhat she terms \u201cthe justice approach\u201d, giving the\nimpression that the two approaches are separate and mutually exclusive\nstyles of moral reasoning (Gilligan 1982). By the 1990s, however, many\ncare ethicists had revised their views. Rather than seeing care and\njustice as mutually exclusive alternatives, they began to recognize\nthat attention to care should be accompanied by attention to fairness\n(justice) in order to attend to the plight of those with whom we have\nno immediate relation (Koggel 1998). Moreover, they recognized that\nthe need to evaluate existing practices or systems of care requires\napplying principles of justice like equality and fairness (Held [ed.]\n1995; Kittay 2002; Schutte 2002).\n\nLike care, the history of Western philosophy has largely disregarded\nthe role of emotion in political life, in particular because\nemotionality is frequently associated with women and racialized\nothers. However, feminist political philosophers have insisted on the\nimportance of this intersection (for example Hall 2005, Krause 2008,\nand Nussbaum 2013). Building on the contributions of feminist care\nethicists and difference feminists who worked to show the significance\nof positive affects typically associated with femininity in ethical\nencounters\u2014such as love, interest, and care\u2014(see Held\n[ed.] 1995; Tronto 1993), other thinkers worried that this appraisal\nmerely reified a false (gendered) dichotomy between reason and\nemotion, mind and body. Instead, early work by Alison Jaggar (1989),\nElizabeth Spelman (1989 and 1991), Genevieve Lloyd (1984 [1993]),\nElizabeth Grosz (1994), and others argued that reason is both embodied\nand emotion-laden, and that emotion has epistemic and moral value.\nBuilding on this work, feminist political theorists have argued that\nunderstanding the role of emotion and affect is crucial for\nunderstanding a number of important political phenomena: motivation\nfor action (Krause 2008), collective action and community formation\n(Beltr\u00e1n 2009 & 2010; Butler 2004 & 2015), solidarity\nand patriotism (Nussbaum 2006 and 2013), as well as vulnerability\n(Fineman 2008 [2011]), racism and xenophobia (Ahmed 2004 [2014]; Anker\n2014; Ioanide 2015). Meanwhile, others examine the political\nsignificance of specific emotions, for instance: shame (Ahmed 2004\n[2014]), grief (Butler 2004), anger (Cherry 2021; Spelman 1989; Lorde\n1984), fear (Anker 2014), empathy (Hirji 2022), and love (Nussbaum\n2013).\n\nMore recently, many feminist critics have turned their attention to\nthe ways that neoliberalism demands resiliency and self-reliance in\nthe face of increasing precarity. Some borrow from Michel\nFoucault\u2019s late work on biopolitics, examining how neoliberal\ndemands for autonomy, self-sufficiency, self-discipline, and\nself-investment impact individuals on the level of subjectivity,\nmaking both life and the possibility of political action to transform\nthe conditions of life increasingly untenable. Individuals, they\nargue, are met with increasing vulnerability to economic forces and\nfewer resources to overcome vulnerability due to social isolation and\nlimited access to social services (Butler 2015; Povinelli 2011). Some\nfeminists study how subjectivity, affect, and morality accommodate\nthese neoliberal trends. For instance, this shows up in how the demand\nto \u201covercome vulnerability\u201d via the contemporary emphasis\non individual \u201cresilience\u201d attempts to transform\nvulnerable persons, especially women, into productive neoliberal\nsubjects (James 2015), how productive emotions like\n\u201chappiness\u201d are encouraged and unruly ones like\n\u201cwillfulness\u201d are discouraged (Berlant 2011; Ahmed 2014),\nor how the targeted discourse around \u201cself-care\u201d can\ncontribute to individualist consumer culture that diminishes\nwomen\u2019s capacities for collective action (Ahmed 2017). Instead,\nmany feminist critiques challenge neoliberal individualism by\nreasserting that agency need not be synonymous with autonomy, and\npropose nonsovereign or relational accounts of the agentic subject\ninstead (Butler 2015). Along with care, some theorists have turned to\ncontemplative practices like meditation (in the Zen Buddhist\ntradition, for instance) to recover important resources for democratic\nlife (Mariotti 2020).\n2.6 Intersectional Feminisms\n\nOne of the issues that has been most vexing and generative for\nfeminist theory in general and feminist political philosophy in\nparticular is the matter of identity (see the entry on\n identity politics).\n Identity politics, itself a politically vexed term, refers to\npolitical practices of mobilizing for change on the basis of a\npolitical identity (women, Black, Chicana, etc.; see Alcoff 2006;\nMatsuda 1996). The philosophical debate is whether such identities are\nbased on some real difference or history of oppression, and also\nwhether people should embrace identities that have historically been\nused to oppress them. Identity politics in feminist practice is\nfraught because for some feminists, concerns about identity are\nthought to weaken feminist political unity and solidarity (Hooker\n2009; Zerilli 2005). As Emi Koyama writes in the introduction to\n\u201cThe Transfeminist Manifesto\u201d:\n\n\nThe latter half of the twentieth century witnessed an unprecedented\nbroadening of American feminist movement as the result of the\nparticipation of diverse groups of women. When a group of women who\nhad previously been marginalized within the mainstream of the feminist\nmovement broke their silence, demanding their rightful place within\nit, they were first accused of fragmenting feminism with trivial\nmatters, and then were eventually accepted and welcomed as a valuable\npart of the feminist thought. We have become increasingly aware that\nthe diversity is our strength, not weakness. (Koyama 2001: 11)\n\n\nMoreover, feminist theorists of color have shown (Davis 1981; hooks\n1981; Lorde 1984; Mohanty 1991) that the feminist movement has always\nelevated the interests of some groups and ignored or disfigured the\ninterests of others. What looks like unity or neutrality is often\nexclusion. Indeed, those for whom \u201cwoman\u201d is only one of\nseveral sources for group identification (e.g, Black women) have\nraised questions about which identity is foremost or whether either\nidentity is apt. Such questions play out with the question of\n political representation\u2014what\n aspects of identity are politically salient and truly representative,\nwhether race, class, or gender (Phillips 1995; Young 1997, 2000). The\nontological question of women\u2019s identity gets played out on the\npolitical stage when it comes to matters of political representation,\ngroup rights, and affirmative action. The 2008 U.S. Democratic Party\nprimary battle between Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\nturned this philosophical question into a very real and heated one\nfrom Black women throughout the United States. Was a Black woman who\nsupported Clinton a traitor to her race, or a Black woman who\nsupported Obama a traitor to her sex? Or did it make any sense to talk\nabout identity in a way that would lead to charges of treason?\n\nTheories of intersectionality emerged in the U.S. context from the\ngroundbreaking work of multiple thinkers (for an excellent history of\nthe emergence of \u201cintersectionality\u201d within Black feminist\nand womanist thought, see J. Nash 2019), including Kimberl\u00e9\nCrenshaw\u2019s \u201cDemarginalizing the Intersection of Race and\nSex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine,\nFeminist Theory and Antiracist Practice\u201d (Crenshaw 1989),\nPatricia Hill Collins\u2019s book Black Feminist Thought:\nKnowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment (Collins\n1990), Angela Davis\u2019s Women, Race, and Class (Davis\n1981), Audre Lorde\u2019s Sister Outsider (1984), and\nPatricia Williams\u2019s The Alchemy of Race and Rights\n(Williams 1991). While their specific language and emphasis varies,\nthese theorists and others generally agree that intersectionality is\nan analytic framework that helps to understand how oppression and\nprivilege along particular \u201caxes\u201d of identity (gender,\nrace, class, disability, and the like) do not work independently, but\nintermesh in complex ways that shape our social relations, identities,\ninterests, and experiences. The impact of this work was felt strongly\nwhere it originated in feminist legal theory (see\n feminist philosophy of law),\n and has continued to be an important concept for theories of power\nand oppression in and out of feminist political philosophy. (See also\nthe section on\n intersectionality\n in the entry on\n discrimination.)\n2.7 Transnational, Decolonial, and Indigenous Feminisms\n\nWhile intersectionality emerged largely within the U.S. context,\ntransnational, decolonial, and indigenous feminists theorize the\npolitical across, between, and against nation-state borders. Indeed,\n\u201cthe border\u201d becomes an important geopolitical, cultural,\nand symbolic figure animating the work of feminist thinkers in this\narea. Here, like elsewhere in feminist political philosophy, new ideas\nin philosophy are often generated through the examination of practical\npolitical concerns in the lives of women. For scholars working in\nthese areas, many of the issues and theories discussed emerge from\nongoing histories of\n colonialism,\n settler colonialism, and imperialism.\n\nThe writings of postcolonial and transnational feminist theorists\noften raised the need for awareness of multiple global perspectives as\na challenge to Euro- and Anglo-centric feminist theory by focusing on\nthe lived realities of women in the Global South, such as issues\nrelated to working conditions and migration (Walia 2013). Chandra\nTalpade Mohanty\u2019s Feminism without Borders (2003) is a\npathbreaking work in this respect, examining both the theoretical and\npractical political consequences of global capitalism for women across\nthe globe and for the future of feminist struggle. In the Middle\nEastern context, Lila Abu-Lughod famously asked \u201cDo Muslim Women\nNeed Saving?\u201d (2013), challenging the notion in many strains\ndominant in Western feminism that Muslim women are oppressed by their\nown culture (for more on culture see Narayan 1997). Discussing the\nimpact of transnational feminist work during this period, Sharon\nKrause writes that, \u201cthis development involved the \u2018world\ndiversification\u2019 of feminism to a more global, comparative, and\ndifferentiated body of work\u201d (Krause 2011: 106). This\ndiversification, Krause notes, is also due to new literature on\nintersectionality, that is, the ways in which the intersections of our\nmultiple identities (race, gender, orientation, ethnicity, etc.) all\nneed to be attended to in talking about political change (Krause 2011:\n107). Intersectionality also resonates with discussions of\n\u201chybridity\u201d in postcolonial literature, of religion and\nglobalization, and of the experiences of LGBTQ people. \u201cThe\nresult is an explosion of knowledge about the lived experience of\ndifferently placed and multiply-positioned women\u201d (2011: 107).\nGiven so many sources of difference and division among women across\nthe globe, is a transnational feminist solidarity possible? Are there\nuniversal values and commitments on which to ground feminist activism\nand solidarity that do not reproduce Western ethnocentrism and\nimperialism? (For approaches to these questions, see Khader 2019.)\n\nWhile transnational feminist theorists are largely concerned with the\nimpacts of cross-border global processes, indigenous feminist\ncontributions to political theory in the U.S. and Canada have\ndeveloped important critiques of settler colonialism and its\nborders (for more on settler colonial states, decolonial resistance,\nand post-colonial theory see the entry on\n colonialism).\n Audra Simpson\u2019s Mohawk Interruptus: Political Life Across\nthe Borders of Settler States (2014) \u201cinterrupts\u201d\nsettler colonial conceptualizations of political terms like legitimacy\nand sovereignty with alternative meanings rooted in Kahnaw\u00e0:ke\nMohawk life and the political history of the Iroquois Confederacy.\n(See also Leanne Betasamosake Simpson 2017 on place-based resistance\nto settler colonialism.) In the Australian context, Aileen\nMoreton-Robinson challenges the ways that white women inside and\noutside of the academy benefit from colonialism and strategically\nwield power against indigenous women (Moreton-Robinson 2000). These\nconcerns mark a broader and increasing focus among indigenous,\ndecolonial, and intersectional feminists on critiques of whiteness\n(see also Alcoff 2006 & 2015).\n\nDecolonial feminists overlap in many areas with other women of color\nfeminists, but they bring several unique concerns specific to the\ncolonial and post-colonial experience. In contemporary decolonial\ntheory, these concerns are largely framed within the discourse of\n\u201ccoloniality\u201d, first theorized in terms of\n\u201ccoloniality of power\u201d by Anibal Quijano (2003). Here,\n\u201ccoloniality\u201d refers to how relations between colonizer\nand colonized are racialized, for instance how labor, subjectivity,\nand authority are racialized around the colonial system of capitalist\nexploitation. (For more on \u201ccoloniality\u201d, see Lugones\n2010; Mignolo 2000; Maldonado Torres 2008; Wynter 2003.) For feminist\nthinkers like Mar\u00eda Lugones (2007, 2010), gender is another\naxis around which the global capitalist system of power classifies and\ndehumanizes colonized people. For Lugones and others, including\nOy\u00e8r\u00f3nk\u1eb9\u0301 Oy\u011bw\u00f9m\u00ed (1997),\ngender is a colonial imposition in tension with non-modern\ncosmologies, economies, and modes of kinship. Lugones calls this the\n\u201ccoloniality of gender\u201d, noting that de-colonizing gender\nis part of a wider project of decolonial resistance opposed to the\ncategorial, dichotomous, and hierarchical logics of capitalist\nmodernity that are rooted in the colonization of the Americas.\nAccording to Lugones, the autonomous, independent, and univocal\nconception of the self is one of the Eurocentric \u201clogics of\npurity\u201d that has become culturally dominant, shaping our modes\nof political thought and action in ways that pathologize decolonial\nresistance. Lugones\u2019 critique is especially evident in her claim\nthat colonized people are not agents. Here, she does not mean that the\ncolonized and oppressed, including colonized women, lack capacities\nfor action and resistance\u2014indeed, she argues that resistance\nmeets oppression \u201cenduringly\u201d. Rather, she points out that\naccording to the Eurocentric logic that defines agency as fully\ncapacitated, intentional, and autonomous, colonized people are\nconsidered non-agential (Lugones 2005: 86). Instead, she develops the\nconcept \u201cactive subjectivity\u201d to name the kinds of\nresistant practices that develop under conditions of oppression.\nRather than a feminist or decolonial \u201cunity\u201d that\ncollapses difference, Lugones seeks to sustain forms of coalition\nacross difference (Lugones 2003). (See also the section \u201cLatin\nAmerican Feminist Philosophy\u201d in the entry on\n Latin American Feminism.)\n\nIn feminist decolonial literature, resistance is often discussed in\nterms of the coloniality of gender (Lugones 2003, 2007, 2010;\nOy\u011bw\u00f9m\u00ed 1997); language (Spivak 1988); identity and\nsubjectivity\u2014for instance, accounts of hybridity,\nborder-thinking, multiplicity, and mestizaje (Anzald\u00faa\n1987; Ortega 2016; Moraga & Anzald\u00faa [eds] 1981 [2015];\nPitts 2021a); and \u201cworld-traveling\u201d (Lugones 1995; Ortega\n2016). Many of these same thinkers argue that feminism itself must be\ndecolonized, critiquing feminist universalisms that claim to account\nfor the complex intersections of sexuality, race, gender, and class\n(see Khader 2019; Lugones 2010; Mohanty 2003; Verg\u00e8s 2019\n[2021]).\n2.8 Feminist Democratic Theory\n\nAre there any reliable foundations on which to base feminist politics?\nBy the end of the 1990s, postmodern critiques of the subject and\nfeminist critiques of the category \u201cwoman\u201d produced real\nuncertainty about the status of the subject of feminist politics,\nseeing a radical danger of relativism and disunity, and the field\nseemed to be at an impasse. But then another approach began to emerge.\nAs Mary Dietz writes in her 2003 essay on current controversies in\nfeminist theory,\n\n\nIn recent years, political theorists have been engaged in debates\nabout what it might mean to conceptualize a feminist political praxis\nthat is aligned with democracy but does not begin from the binary of\ngender. Along these lines, Mouffe (1992b: 376, 378; 1993), for\nexample, proposes a feminist conception of democratic citizenship that\nwould render sexual difference \u201ceffectively nonpertinent\u201d.\nPerhaps the salient feature of such conceptions is the turn toward\nplurality, which posits democratic society as a field of interaction\nwhere multiple axes of difference, identity, and subordination\npoliticize and intersect. (Dietz 2003: 419; citing Phelan 1994; Young\n1990, 1997, 2000; Benhabib 1992; Honig 1992; K. Ferguson 1993;\nPhillips 1993, 1995; Mouffe 1993; Yeatman 1994, 2001; Bickford 1996;\nDean 1996; Fraser 1997; K. Nash 1998; Heyes 2000; McAfee 2000)\n\n\nFollowing up on what has happened in feminist political theory since\nDietz\u2019s article, Sharon Krause writes that this work is\n\u201ccontesting the old assumption that agency equals\nautonomy\u201d and makes room \u201cwithin agency for forms of\nsubjectivity and action that are nonsovereign but nevertheless\npotent\u201d (Krause 2011; citing Amy Allen 2008, Beltr\u00e1n\n2010, Butler 2004, Hirschmann 2003, and Zerilli 2005.) \u201cFor some\ntheorists\u201d, Krause writes,\n\n\nthis shift involves thinking of agency and freedom in more collective\nways, which emphasize solidarity, relationality, and constitutive\nintersubjectivity. (Krause 2011: 108; citing Butler 2004; Cornell\n2007; Mohanty 2003; and Nedelsky 2005)\n\n\n(As we saw in the previous section, decolonial feminists like Lugones\nwere already critiquing Eurocentric conceptualizations of agency that\npresume individual autonomy and sovereignty [Lugones 2003].)\n\nThis constellation of thinkers have a performative account of politics\nand subjectivity. Performative in several senses: in theorizing how\nagency is constituted, how political judgments can be made in the\nabsence of known rules (Honig 2009: 309), how new universals can be\ncreated and new communities constituted. From a performative feminist\nperspective, feminism is a project of anticipating and creating better\npolitical futures in the absence of foundations. As Linda Zerilli\nwrites,\n\n\npolitics is about making claims and judgments\u2014and having the\ncourage to do so\u2014in the absence of the objective criteria or\nrules that could provide certain knowledge and the guarantee that\nspeaking in women\u2019s name will be accepted or taken up by others.\n(Zerilli 2005: 179)\n\n\nZerilli calls for a \u201cfreedom-centered feminism\u201d that\n\n\nwould strive to bring about transformation in normative conceptions of\ngender without returning to the classical notion of freedom as\nsovereignty\n\n\nthat feminists have long criticized but found difficult to resist\n(ibid.). Rather than basing politics on already existing categories,\nprinciples, or values, a performative approach understands categories\nlike identity and gender to be performatively constituted, thus\nappealing to other people, not to supposed universal truths or\nfoundations. \u201cHow we assume these identities\u201d, Drucilla\nCornell writes,\n\n\nis never something \u201cout there\u201d that effectively determines\nwho we can be as men and women\u2014gay, lesbian, straight, queer,\ntranssexual, transgender, or otherwise. (Cornell 2003: 144)\n\n\nIt is something that is shaped as we live and externalize identities\nwith others.\n\nThis view takes democracy to be an ongoing and unfinished project with\nany outcome open to further contestation. It recuperates many of the\nideals of the Enlightenment\u2014such as freedom, autonomy, and\njustice\u2014but in a way that drops the Enlightenment\u2019s\nmetaphysical assumptions about reason, progress, and human nature.\nInstead of seeing these ideals as grounded in some metaphysical facts,\nthis new view sees them as ideals that people hold and try to\ninstantiate through practice and imagination. Where many ancient and\nmodern ideals of politics were based on suppositions about the nature\nof reality or of human beings, contemporary political philosophies\ngenerally operate without supposing that there are any universal or\neternal truths. Some might see this situation as ripe for nihilism,\narbitrariness, or the exercise of brute power. The democratic\nalternative is to imagine and try to create a better world by\nanticipating, claiming, and appealing to others that it should be so.\nEven if there is no metaphysical truth that human beings have dignity\nand infinite worth, people can act as if it were true in order to\ncreate a world in which it is seen to be so.\n\nDespite the shared post-foundational theorizing among democratic\nfeminist theorists and the commitment to thinking of politics as\nplural, when it comes to thinking about democratic politics, there are\nsharp divergences, namely on the question of \u201cwhat it means to\nactualize public spaces and enact democratic politics\u201d (Dietz\n2003: 419). On this question, theorists tend to diverge into two\ngroups: associational and agonistic. Associational theorists (e.g.,\nBenhabib 1992, [ed.] 1996b; Benhabib & Cornell [eds] 1987; Fraser\n1989; Young 1990, 1997, 2000) gravitate more toward deliberative\ndemocratic theory. They have roots in the socialist and Marxist\ntraditions, especially as they developed in the Frankfurt-School\ntradition of critical theory. They are more optimistic about the\nprospects for democracy. Agonistic theorists (e.g., Mouffe [ed.]\n1992a, 1993, 1999, 2000; Honig [ed.] 1995; Ziarek 2001) worry that\ndemocratic theories that focus on consensus can silence the kind of\ndisagreement essential for democratic progress. Thus they focus more\non plurality, dissensus, and the ceaseless contestation within\npolitics. Agonistic theorists are grounded in much of the\npoststructural feminist approach described earlier, wary of any claims\nto universality and identity.\n\nThe differences spring from, or perhaps lead to, different readings of\nthe philosopher who has most inspired performative political theory:\n Hannah Arendt,\n namely Arendt\u2019s ideas of speech and action in the public\nsphere, of the meaning of plurality, of the ways in which human beings\ncan distinguish themselves. As Bonnie Honig, a champion of the\nagonistic model writes,\n\n\nPolitical theorists and feminists, in particular, have long criticized\nArendt for the agonistic dimensions of her politics, charging that\nagonism is a masculinist, heroic, violent, competitive, (merely)\naesthetic, or necessarily individualistic practice. For these\ntheorists, the notion of an agonistic feminism would be, at best, a\ncontradiction in terms and, at worst, a muddled and, perhaps,\ndangerous idea. Their perspective is effectively endorsed by Seyla\nBenhabib who, in a recent series of powerful essays, tries to rescue\nArendt for feminism by excising agonism from her thought. (Honig\n1995b: 156)\n\n\nAssociational theorists tend to look for ways, amidst all the\ndifferences and questions about the lack of foundations, it is\npossible to come to agreement on matters of common concern. This is\nseen in feminist democratic theory, perhaps best known through the\nworks of Seyla Benhabib (1992, 1996b), greatly inspired by her\nnon-agonistic reading of Arendt and of the work of the German critical\ntheorist, J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Benhabib\u2019s work engages\ndemocratic theorists quite broadly, not just feminist theorists. The\nfollowing passage helps to clarify what she takes to be the best aim\nof a political philosophy: a state of affairs to which all affected\nwould assent. As she writes,\n\n\nOnly those norms (i.e., general rules of action and institutional\narrangements) can be said to be valid (i.e., morally binding), which\nwould be agreed to by all those affected by their consequences, if\nsuch agreement were reached as a consequence of a process of\ndeliberation that had the following features: 1) participation in such\ndeliberation is governed by norms of equality and symmetry; all have\nthe same chances to initiate speech acts, to question, to interrogate,\nand to open debate; 2) all have the right to question the assigned\ntopics of conversation; and 3) all have the right to initiate\nreflexive arguments about the very rules of the discourse procedure\nand the way in which they are applied or carried out. (Benhabib 1996b:\n70)\n\n\nFollowing Habermas, Benhabib contends that certain conditions need to\nbe in place in order for members of a political community to arrive at\ndemocratic outcomes, namely the proceedings need to be deliberative.\nSome take deliberation to be a matter of reasoned argumentation;\nothers see it as less about reason or argumentation but more about an\nopen process of working through choices. (McAfee 2004.)\n\nNot all theorists who tend toward the associational model embrace\ndeliberative theory so readily. Iris Young\u2019s pioneering book,\nJustice and the Politics of Difference and several of her\nsubsequent works have been very influential and led to a good deal of\nhesitance in feminist theoretical communities about the claims of\ndeliberative theory. Where Benhabib is confident that conditions can\nbe such that all who are affected can have a voice in deliberations,\nYoung points out that those who have been historically silenced have a\ndifficult time having their views heard or heeded. Young is skeptical\nof the claims of mainstream democratic theory that democratic\ndeliberative processes could lead to outcomes that would be acceptable\nto all (Young 1990, 1997). Young, along with Nancy Fraser (1989) and\nothers, worried that in the process of trying to reach consensus, the\nuntrained voices of women and others who have been marginalized would\nbe left out of the final tally. Young\u2019s criticisms were very\npersuasive, leading a generation of feminist political philosophers to\nbe wary of deliberative democratic theory. Instead of deliberative\ndemocracy, in the mid 1990s Young proposed a theory of communicative\ndemocracy, hoping to make way for a deliberative conception that was\nopen to means of expression beyond the rational expression of\nmainstream deliberative democratic theory. Young worried that\ndeliberation as defined by Habermas is too reason-based and leaves out\nforms of communication that women and people of color tend to use,\nincluding, as she puts it, \u201cgreeting, rhetoric, and\nstorytelling\u201d. Young argued that these alternative modes of\ncommunication could provide the basis of a more democratic,\ncommunicative theory. In her last major book, Inclusion and\nDemocracy (2000), Young had clearly moved to embrace deliberative\ntheory itself, seeing the ways in which it could be constructed to\ngive voice to those who had been otherwise marginalized. More recent\nfeminist democratic theory has engaged deliberative theory more\npositively (see McAfee & Snyder 2007).\n\nWhere liberal feminists inspired by\n John Rawls\n and democratic feminists inspired by\n J\u00fcrgen Habermas\n and/or\n John Dewey\n hold out the hope that democratic deliberations might lead to\ndemocratic agreements, agonistic feminists are wary of consensus as\ninherently undemocratic. Agonistic feminist political philosophy comes\nout of poststructural continental feminist and philosophical\ntraditions. It takes from Marxism the hope for a more radically\negalitarian society. It takes from contemporary continental philosophy\nnotions of subjectivity and solidarity as malleable and constructed.\nAlong with postmodern thought, it repudiates any notion of\npre-existing moral or political truths or foundations (Ziarek 2001).\nIts central claim is that feminist struggle, like other struggles for\nsocial justice, is engaged in politics as ceaseless contestation.\nAgonistic views see the nature of politics as inherently conflictual,\nwith battles over the direction of political society being the central\ntask of democratic struggle. Advocates of agonistic politics worry\nthat the kind of consensus sought by democratic theorists (discussed\nabove) will lead to some kind of oppression or injustice by silencing\nnew struggles. As Chantal Mouffe puts it,\n\n\nWe have to accept that every consensus exists as a temporary result of\na provisional hegemony, as a stabilization of power, and that it\nalways entails some form of exclusion. (Mouffe 2000: 104)\n\n\nWhere associational theorists seek out ways that people can overcome\nsystematically distorted communication and deliberation, Dietz notes\nthat agonists eschew this project because they understand politics\nas\n\n\nessentially a practice of creation, reproduction, transformation and\narticulation.... Simply put, associational feminists scrutinize the\nconditions of exclusion in order to theorize the emancipation of the\nsubject in the public sphere of communicative interaction; agonistic\nfeminists deconstruct emancipatory procedures to disclose how the\nsubject is both produced through political exclusions and positioned\nagainst them. (Dietz 2003: 422)\n\n3. New Directions in Feminist Political Philosophy\n\nAs a recent review writes,\n\n\nFeminist theory today is a sprawling, productive, diverse intellectual\nand political assemblage. It grows through imaginative\ninterdisciplinary work and critical political engagements. Feminist\ntheory is not only about women, although it is that; it is about the\nworld, engaged through critical intersectional perspectives. (K.\nFerguson 2017)\n\n\nNew work in feminist political philosophy continues to transform\npolitical philosophy, including ancient debates over identity versus\ndifference, the private and the public, certainty and freedom. For\nexample, new readings of Arendt\u2019s philosophy offer hope of\nmoving beyond the associational/agonistic divide in democratic\nfeminist theory (Barker et al. [eds] 2012). Benhabib\u2019s\nproceduralism is being surpassed with more affect-laden accounts of\ndeliberation (Krause 2008; Howard 2017). Instead of the rational\nback-and-forth of reasoned argumentation, theorists are beginning to\nsee deliberative talk as forms of constituting the subject, judging\nwithout pre-conceived truths, and performatively creating new\npolitical projects (Zerilli 2005 and 2016).\n\nSome of the most generative sites for feminist political theorizing\ntoday are the global threats that face all of us, for instance\nenvironmental degradation or the rise of authoritarianism. In\necofeminist perspectives, as the entry on\n feminist environmental philosophy\n explains, the domination and destruction of \u201cnature\u201d has\nlong been recognized as a feminist issue of political significance\n(especially due to the deep associations between femininity and nature\nthat run through Western patriarchal philosophy and culture). More\nrecently, ecofeminists have extended theories of democracy, agency,\nand rights to include elements of the natural world (Nussbaum 2022).\nMeanwhile, with the rise of authoritarianism in governments across the\nglobe in the second decade of the twenty-first century, feminist\npolitical philosophers have tried to understand the roots of recent\nthreats to democracy (Fraser 2019; McAfee 2019; Nussbaum 2018).\n\nIn sum, feminist political philosophy is a still evolving field of\nthought that has much to offer mainstream political philosophy. In the\npast two decades it has come to exert a stronger influence over\nmainstream political theorizing, raising objections that mainstream\nphilosophers have had to address, though not always very convincingly.\nAnd in its newest developments it promises to go even further.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abbey, Ruth, 2011, <em>The Return of Feminist Liberalism</em>,\nDurham, UK: Acumen.", "Abu-Lughod, Lila (ed.), 1998, <em>Remaking Women: Feminism and\nModernity in the Middle East</em>, (Princeton Studies in\nCulture/Power/History), Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.\ndoi:10.1515/9781400831203", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2013, <em>Do Muslim Women Need\nSaving?</em>, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.\ndoi:10.4159/9780674726338", "Ackerly, Brooke A., 2000, <em>Political Theory and Feminist Social\nCriticism</em>, (Contemporary Political Theory), Cambridge/New York:\nCambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511490149", "Ackerly, Brooke A. and Susan Moller Okin, 1999, \u201cFeminist\nSocial Criticism and the International Movement for Women\u2019s\nRights as Human Rights\u201d, in <em>Democracy\u2019s Edges</em>,\nIan Shapiro and Casiano Hacker-Cord\u00f3n (eds), Cambridge/New\nYork: Cambridge University Press, 134\u2013162.\ndoi:10.1017/CBO9780511586361.010", "Ahmed, Sara, 2000, <em>Strange Encounters: Embodied Others in\nPost-Coloniality</em>, (Transformations), London/New York: Routledge.\ndoi:10.4324/9780203349700", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2004 [2014], <em>The Cultural Politics of\nEmotion</em>, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press.
