    "main_text": "Substances, Elements, and Chemical Combination || Lavoisier\u2019s Elements\n1.2 Lavoisier\u2019s Elements\n\nAntoine Lavoisier (1743\u20131794) is often called the father of\nmodern chemistry, and by 1789 he had produced a list of the elements\nthat a modern chemist would recognize. Lavoisier\u2019s list, however, was\nnot identical to our modern one. Some items such as hydrogen and\noxygen gases were regarded as compounds by Lavoisier, although we now\nknow regard hydrogen and oxygen as elements and their gases as\nmolecules.\n\nOther items on his list were remnants of the Aristotelian system which\nhave no place at all in the modern system. For example, fire remained\non his list, although in the somewhat altered form of caloric. Air is\nanalyzed into several components: the respirable part called oxygen\nand the remainder called azote or nitrogen. Four types of earth found\na place on his list: lime, magnesia, barytes, and argill. The\ncomposition of these earths are \u201ctotally unknown, and, until by\nnew discoveries their constituent elements are ascertained, we are\ncertainly authorized to consider them as simple bodies\u201d (1789,\np. 157), although Lavoisier goes on to speculate that \u201call the\nsubstances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds\u201d (1789, p.\n159).\n\nWhat is especially important about Lavoisier\u2019s system is his\ndiscussion of how the elemental basis of particular compounds is\ndetermined. For example, he describes how water can be shown to be a\ncompound of hydrogen and oxygen (1789, pp. 83\u201396). He\nwrites:\n\nWhen 16 ounces of alcohol are burnt in an apparatus properly adapted\nfor collecting all the water disengaged during the combustion, we\nobtain from 17 to 18 ounces of water. As no substance can furnish a\nproduct larger than its original bulk, it follows, that something else\nhas united with the alcohol during its combustion; and I have already\nshown that this must be oxygen, or the base of air. Thus alcohol\ncontains hydrogen, which is one of the elements of water; and the\natmospheric air contains oxygen, which is the other element necessary\nto the composition of water (1789, p. 96).\n\n\nThe metaphysical principle of the conservation of matter\u2014that\nmatter can be neither created nor destroyed in chemical\nprocesses\u2014called upon here is at least as old as Aristotle\n(Weisheipl 1963). What the present passage illustrates is the\nemployment of a criterion of conservation: the preservation of mass.\nThe total mass of the products must come from the mass of the\nreactants, and if this is not to be found in the easily visible ones,\nthen there must be other, less readily visible reactants.\n\nThis principle enabled Lavoisier to put what was essentially\nAristotle\u2019s notion of simple substances (302a15ff., quoted in section\n1.1) to much more effective experimental use. Directly after rejecting\natomic theories, he says \u201cif we apply the term\nelements, or principles of bodies, to express our\nidea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must\nadmit, as elements, all the substances into which we are capable, by\nany means, to reduce bodies by decomposition\u201d (1789, p. xxiv).\nIn other words, elements are identified as the smallest components of\nsubstances that we can produce experimentally. The principle of the\nconservation of mass provided for a criterion of when a chemical\nchange was a decomposition into simpler substances, which was decisive\nin disposing of the phlogiston theory. The increase in weight on\ncalcination meant, in the light of this principle, that calcination\nwas not a decomposition, as the phlogiston theorists would have it,\nbut the formation of a more complex compound.\n\nDespite the pragmatic character of this definition, Lavoisier felt\nfree to speculate about the compound nature of the earths, as well as\nthe formation of metal oxides which required the decomposition of\noxygen gas. Thus, Lavoisier also developed the notion of an element as\na theoretical, last point of analysis concept. While this last point\nof analysis conception remained an important notion for Lavoisier as\nit was for Aristotle, his notion was a significant advance over\nAristotle\u2019s and provided the basis for further theoretical advance in\nthe 19th century (Hendry 2005).\n",
