    "main_text": "Criticizing Naturalism (427d\u2013435d) || Cratylus\u2019 Naturalism\n8.1 Cratylus\u2019 Naturalism\n\nSocrates begins his discussion with Cratylus by observing that the\nproducts of craftsmen are usually of variable quality\n(428e\u2013429a). Cratylus denies that this principle applies to the\nproducts of (linguistic) lawgivers (429b). Even though he takes\netymologically simple names to be imitations, he thus commits himself\nto the following claim:\n\n(C1)\nNo name can be any better or worse than any other name.\n\n\nSocrates takes (C1) to imply that \u201call names have been set down\ncorrectly\u201d and asks Cratylus whether he accepts this implication\n(429b/c). Cratylus responds by endorsing a second claim (429c):\n\n(C2)\nA linguistic device is a name for its (conventional) referents if\nand only if it fulfils the standard of correctness described by\n (NAT**).\n\n\nAnd it soon turns out that there is yet another claim that Cratylus\nwants to defend (429c\u2013430a):\n\n(C3)\nIf a name is not a correct name for an object, it cannot possibly\nbe applied to this object (and thus be used to speak falsely).\n\n\nThese three claims are very counterintuitive, and Socrates immediately\nbegins to attack\n (C3)\n and\n (C1).\n His arguments against these two claims rely on the presupposition\nthat etymologically simple names are imitations and can thus be\ncompared to pictures. To refute (C3), Socrates observes that it is\npossible to assign a picture of a man to a woman, and that it should\ntherefore be equally possible to apply an etymologically simple name\nthat does not imitate the being of a given object to this object\n(430a\u2013431c). This suffices to show that one can speak falsely by\nmisapplying names. To debunk (C1), Socrates points out that if someone\nwere to produce an object that is perfectly like Cratylus in every\nrespect, this object would not be a picture of Cratylus, but a second\nCratylus (432a\u2013c). He infers from this that pictures can\nresemble the objects they depict only to a certain degree (432c/d).\nBut if resemblance comes in degrees, imitative success comes in\ndegrees, and qualitative differences between imitations must be\npossible. Consequently, qualitative differences between etymologically\nsimple names must be possible (433a).\n",
