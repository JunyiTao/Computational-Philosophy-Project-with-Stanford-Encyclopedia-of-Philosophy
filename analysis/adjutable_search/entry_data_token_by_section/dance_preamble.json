    "main_text": "\n\nWhat \u201ccounts\u201d as philosophy is a perennial issue that has\nbeen debated both within and outside of the American Philosophical\nAssociation. Is interdisciplinary philosophy that incorporates not\njust insights from other fields but their methods, commitments, and\nforms of discourse still \u201cphilosophy\u201d? This article\nassumes that it is, holding that a philosophy of something\ncan make recourse to conversations and practices in all the domains\nthat are relevant to what it is of (in this case dance) so long as\ndoing so aids our thinking about the meaning of that domain.\n\u201cPhilosophy\u201d is thus construed broadly here in keeping\nwith how the term is used in the rapidly growing field of the\nphilosophy of dance. The potential for dance philosophy is enormous,\nin part because dance itself is multifaceted enough to make it connect\nwith many branches of philosophy. Indeed, dance has been practiced\nthroughout history for artistic, educational, therapeutic, social,\npolitical, religious and other purposes. There are also types of dance\non the margins of what many would consider dance proper, such as\ndigital dance, or types of competition dance that have features that\nmake them similar to aesthetic sports like gymnastics or figure\nskating, so what counts as \u201cdance\u201d is at issue in some\ncases as well.\n\nOf course, philosophical approaches (once these are identified)\nprovide just some of the many ways to approach dance in order to\nbetter understand what it is and why it matters to us. There are\ntheories and insights offered by dance cultural theorists,\nsociologists, historians, educators, anthropologists, ethnographers,\npractitioners, dance critics, evolutionary biologists, cognitive\nscientists, psychologists and others, for example, that are relevant\nto the questions asked by philosophers but which rely primarily on the\nmethods of analysis culled from those fields. The field known as\n\u201cdance studies\u201d typically makes use of cultural studies\nand history but often also includes one or more of the perspectives\nabove, including all forms of philosophy (particularly applied and\nphenomenology). Recently the Congress on Research in Dance and the\nSociety of Dance History Scholars merged to form the Dance Studies\nAssociation (see Franko 2014a for more on the field of dance studies).\nDance studies research journals and books often provide good resources\nfor academic philosophy and yet often philosophy students neglect to\nconsult them, sometimes due to ignorance and sometimes due to a fear\nthat they might learn to handle dance\n\u201cnon-philosophically\u201d while they are being trained in\ntraditional philosophic methods. This, among other things, has led to\nthe misperception by some scholars that the field of dance philosophy\nis smaller than it in fact is.\n\nAn additional difficulty is that since the research domain of dance\nstudies is more thoroughly interdisciplinary, and sometimes\ntransdisciplinary, than that of those of us working under the\nconstraints of philosophy departments and their research guidelines\n(where tenure is dependent on publishing in traditional philosophy\njournals, for example) it is not always easy to identify the\nphilosophy and philosophy-relevant discourses within it. Indeed, it is\noften the case that dance philosophers who are multi-methodological,\nnotably Sondra Horton Fraleigh and Maxine Sheets-Johnstone, have rich\nphilosophical insights that are erroneously overlooked or\nmisunderstood, especially in those places where their writing deviates\nfrom that of traditional philosophy (see also Erin Manning\u2019s\nprocess philosophy [2013]). It is also the case that some scholars who\nwork in dance rather than philosophy departments, like Anna Pakes, an\nanalytic dance philosopher, do adhere to the disciplinary boundaries\nof academic philosophy and yet their work that is published in dance\nstudies rather than philosophy books and journals can pass by\nunnoticed. \n\nPhilosophy students and others who are interested in dance philosophy\nare advised to take note of these research-relevant conditions and to\nconsider the meta-philosophical question of both methodology and focus\non inquiry when determining how they will write their own work and\nevaluate that of others. Analytic aesthetics philosophers, for\nexample, might want to know what the \u201cwork\u201d of dance as\nart is and this may not be a question of relevance to the continental,\npragmatic, process or dance-studies integrated philosopher. Similarly,\naccounts of dance that focus heavily on the lived experience of dance\nfor dance-makers and performers that answers to the truth of that\nexperience for dance practitioners may be of interest to performance\nphilosophers, pragmatists and phenomenological philosophers but may\nnot be accepted as relevant by those analytic philosophers who are\ninterested in the critical-appreciative stance.\n\nThese methodological choices by dance philosophers reflect normative\nas well as epistemic commitments (cf. McFee 2018 for another account\nof dance philosophy normativity). Issues of social power, oppression,\nand silencing of viewpoints, for example, may be of interest and\nconcern to one group of dance philosophers while another group sees\nthese concerns as external to questions that interest them (such as\nwhether a triple pirouette counts as expert action, say). Finally, as\nthe institutional field of philosophy in the U.S. and elsewhere\nexpands to include non-Western and non-traditional sources of\nphilosophy, such as that by philosophers whose viewpoints were\nmarginalized or excluded for a variety of reasons, what\n\u201ccounts\u201d as the philosophy of dance will need to expand\nwith it. Noticing which domain or sets of domains or non-domains a\ndance philosopher is working in, which questions interest them, and\nwhat counts as evidence for them can go a long way towards avoiding\nmisunderstandings and inapt criticisms of others\u2019 work. This\npresents both the challenge of the Tower of Babel and the opportunity\nof a truly rich and multi-cultural dance philosophy world.
