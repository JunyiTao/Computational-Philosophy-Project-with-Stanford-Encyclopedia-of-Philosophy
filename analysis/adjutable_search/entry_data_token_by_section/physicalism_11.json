    "main_text": "The Condition Question\n4. The Condition Question\n\nEarlier we distinguished two interpretative questions with respect to\nphysicalism, the completeness question and the condition question. So\nfar we have been concerned with the completeness question. I turn now\nto the condition question, the question of what it is for something\n(an object, an event, a process, a property) to be physical.\n\nThis issue has received less attention in the literature than the\nquestions we have been studying so far. But it is just as important.\nWithout any understanding of what the physical is, we can have no\nserious understanding of what physicalism is. After all, what does it\nmean to say that everything is physical, as opposed to chemical or\nfinancial. (The point here is quite general: if Thales says that\neverything is water, we don\u2019t understand what he says unless he\nsays something about what water is. The physicalist is in the same\nboat.)\n",
