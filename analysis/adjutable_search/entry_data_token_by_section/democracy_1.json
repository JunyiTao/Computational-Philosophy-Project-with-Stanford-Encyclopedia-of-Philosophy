    "main_text": "The Justification of Democracy\n2. The Justification of Democracy\n\nIn this section, we examine different views concerning the\njustification of democracy. Proposed justifications of democracy\nidentify values or reasons that support democracy over alternative\nforms of decision-making, such as oligarchy or dictatorship. It is\nimportant to distinguish views concerning the justification\nof democracy from views concerning the authority of\ndemocracy, which we examine in\n section 3.\n Attempts to establish democratic authority identify values or reasons\nin virtue of which subjects have a duty to obey democratic decisions.\nJustification and authority can come apart (Simmons 2001: ch.\n7)\u2014it is possible to hold that the balance of values or reasons\nsupports democracy over alternative forms of decision-making while\ndenying that subjects have a duty to obey democratic decisions.\n\nWe can evaluate the justification of democracy along at least two\ndifferent dimensions: instrumentally, by reference to the outcomes of\nusing it compared with other methods of political decision; or\nintrinsically, by reference to values that are inherent in the\nmethod.\n",
