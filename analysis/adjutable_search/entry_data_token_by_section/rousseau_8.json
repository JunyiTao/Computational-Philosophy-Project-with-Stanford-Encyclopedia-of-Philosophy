    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || Civil religion and toleration\n3.5 Civil religion and toleration\n\nThe final full chapter of The Social Contract expounds\nRousseau\u2019s doctrine of civil religion. Contemporary readers were\nscandalized by it, and particularly by its claim that true (original\nor early) Christianity is useless in fostering the spirit of\npatriotism and social solidarity necessary for a flourishing state. In\nmany ways the chapter represents a striking departure from the main\nthemes of the book. First, it is the only occasion where Rousseau\nprescribes the content of a law that a just republic must have.\nSecond, it amounts to his acceptance of the inevitability of pluralism\nin matters of religion, and thus of religious toleration; this is in\nsome tension with his encouragement elsewhere of cultural homogeneity\nas a propitious environment for the emergence of a general will.\nThird, it represents a very concrete example of the limits of\nsovereign power: following Locke, Rousseau insists upon the inability\nof the sovereign to examine the private beliefs of citizens. The\ntenets of Rousseau\u2019s civil religion include the affirmation of\nthe existence of a supreme being and of the afterlife, the principle\nthat the just will prosper and the wicked will be punished, and the\nclaim that the social contract and the laws are sacred. In addition,\nthe civil religion requires the provision that all those willing to\ntolerate others should themselves be tolerated, but those who insist\nthat there is no salvation outside their particular church cannot be\ncitizens of the state. The structure of religious beliefs within the\njust state is that of an overlapping consensus: the dogmas of the\ncivil religion are such that they can be affirmed by adherents of a\nnumber of different faiths, both Christian and non-Christian.\n\nDespite Rousseau\u2019s concern for religious toleration both in the\nchapter and elsewhere, modern readers have often been repelled by one\nstriking note of intolerance. Rousseau argues that those who cannot\naccept the dogmas can be banished from the state. This is because he\nbelieves that atheists, having no fear of divine punishment, cannot be\ntrusted by their fellow citizens to obey the law. He goes even\nfurther, to suggest the death penalty for those who affirm the dogmas\nbut later act as if they do not believe them.\n",
