    "main_text": "\n\n Though little known in the Anglophone world, and largely forgotten\neven in the Germanic world, August Wilhelm Rehberg (1757-1836) was a\npivotal thinker in the era of classical German philosophy from Kant to\nHegel.  No thinker from that fertile period has been more unjustly\nneglected.  He wrote some acute and highly-regarded reviews of Kant,\nand he corresponded with Kant about the philosophy of\n mathematics.[1]\n Kant's reply to Rehberg's objections is one\nof his most important explanations of his mathematical\n doctrines.[2]\n Such, indeed, was Rehberg's grasp of Kant that\nJ.B. Jachmann, Kant's friend and biographer, regarded him as\n\u201cthe finest head among all your\n students.\u201d[3]\n But Rehberg was much more than a Kantian epigone.  He also made an\noriginal contribution to the pantheism controversy, where he staked\nout his own position vis-\u00e0-vis Jacobi, Mendelssohn,\nHerder and Kant; and he wrote an influential critique of Reinhold's\nElementarphilosophie, which was a potent source of the\nskepticism surrounding neo-Kantian foundationalism in the early 1790s.\nAll these facts are sufficient to give Rehberg a notable, if minor,\nplace in the intellectual pantheon of his age.  They are not, however,\nthe main reason for remembering him.  \n\n Rehberg's historical importance lies chiefly in his critique of the\nFrench Revolution.  In the early 1790s he became renowned as its\nforemost conservative critic.  He was the chief spokesman for the\nso-called \u2018Hannoverian Whigs\u2019, a group of conservative\nwriters based in G\u00f6ttingen who defended the old\nSt\u00e4ndesstaat (i.e., a state based on the old society\nof estates) against revolutionary\n ideology.[4]\n Rehberg provided the philosophical foundations for the politics of the\nHannoverians, and he saw more clearly than they, or any other\nconservative writer of his day, the general philosophical issues\nraised by the Revolution.  The basis for his attack on revolutionary\nideology was his skeptical epistemology, which grew out of his study\nof Hume and Kant.  For all these reasons, Rehberg has been rightly\nregarded as a founding father of German\n conservatism.[5]\n",
