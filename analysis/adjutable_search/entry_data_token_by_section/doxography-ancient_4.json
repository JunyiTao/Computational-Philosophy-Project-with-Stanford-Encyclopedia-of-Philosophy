    "main_text": "Using doxographies\n5. Using doxographies\n\nWhen we inquire into the way ancient authors have used the information\nprovided by A\u00ebtius\u2019 Placita, by its progeny, and\nby its post-Theophrastean predecessors, we often find that the\nfunction of these collections of doxai is not much different\nfrom the functions of similar overviews in the context of\nAristotle\u2019s dialectical discussions. The main objective of these\nauthors, who are in a position to base themselves on evidence that has\nalready been provided with a definite structure, is to ascertain\nwhether a given doxa may eventually prove to be useful, and\nwhich doxai should be rejected\u2014depending, naturally, on\nthe point of view of the user (who may be a physician or a\nphilosopher, a Stoic or an Epicurean, a Platonist or an Aristotelian,\na pagan or a Christian). Sometimes all the doxai belonging to\na specific sub-set, or dealing with a specific theme, may turn out to\nbe unacceptable, or useless, under certain circumstances or to\nsomebody in particular. The fact should never be lost from view that\nthe Placita merely provides a status quaestionis:\nmaterial for instruction, discussion and reflection on, say, the shape\nof the moon, or the size of the sun, or the causes of earthquakes, or\nof the flooding of the Nile, or the various explanations of visual\nperception. Neither a suspension of judgement, in the manner of the\nSkeptics, nor a positive outcome, in the manner of Aristotle or the\nStoics, is ever formulated, no explicit advice ever given either way.\nOnly very rarely is there a critical note.\n\nFurthermore, there is a significant difference between\nAristotle\u2019s overviews (which we know much better than those of\nTheophrastus, so for the sake of clarity one may restrict oneself to\nAristotle) and the corresponding passages and sections in A\u00ebtius\nand his family. Aristotle\u2019s purpose was to make a choice and to\nfind a solution, and many later authors also wanted this. But numerous\nchapters in the Placita literature when taken at face-value\nseem to make a decision impossible, because the bald diaeretic\ncontrast between the tenets listed in the lemmata results in a logjam,\nor diaphonia (\u2018discordance\u2019), as the ancient\nSkeptics called it. It might be concluded from this stalemate that the\nonly remaining option is to suspend one\u2019s judgment. It was at\nthe time impossible, for instance, to find out whether there is one\ncosmic system, or more. It is an attractive idea that at least part of\nthe material (in the course of time naturally updated by the inclusion\nof post-Aristotelian tenets) was adapted by Academic Skeptics to\ninduce the tranquillity of mind which follows upon suspension of\njudgment.\n",
