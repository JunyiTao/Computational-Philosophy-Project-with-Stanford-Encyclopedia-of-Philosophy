    "main_text": "\n\nImre Lakatos (1922\u20131974) was a Hungarian-born philosopher of\nmathematics and science who rose to prominence in Britain, having fled\nhis native land in 1956 when the Hungarian Uprising was suppressed by\nSoviet tanks. He was notable for his anti-formalist philosophy of\nmathematics (where \u201cformalism\u201d is not just the philosophy\nof Hilbert and his followers but also comprises logicism and\nintuitionism) and for his \u201cMethodology of Scientific Research\nProgrammes\u201d or MSRP, a radical revision of Popper\u2019s\nDemarcation Criterion between science and non-science which gave rise\nto a novel theory of scientific rationality.\n\nAlthough he lived and worked in London, rising to the post of\nProfessor of Logic at the London School of Economics (LSE), Lakatos\nnever became a British citizen, but died a stateless person. Despite\nthe star-studded array of academic lords and knights who were willing\nto testify on his behalf, neither MI5 nor the Special Branch seem to\nhave trusted him, and no less a person than Roy Jenkins, the then Home\nSecretary, signed off on the refusal to naturalize him. (See Bandy\n2009: ch. 16, which includes the transcripts of successive\ninterrogations.)\n\nNonetheless, Lakatos\u2019s influence, particularly in the philosophy\nof science, has been immense. According to Google Scholar, by the\n25th of January 2015, that is, just twenty-five days into\nthe new year, thirty-three papers had been published citing\nLakatos in that year alone, a citation rate of over one paper\nper day. Introductory texts on the Philosophy of Science typically\ninclude substantial sections on Lakatos, some admiring, some critical,\nand many an admixture of the two (see for example Chalmers 2013 and\nGodfrey-Smith 2003). The premier prize for the best book in the\nPhilosophy of Science (funded by the foundation of a wealthy and\nacademically distinguished disciple, Spiro Latsis) is named in his\nhonour. Moreover, Lakatos is one of those philosophers whose influence\nextends well beyond the confines of academic philosophy. Of the\nthirty-three papers citing Lakatos published in the first twenty-five\ndays of 2015, at most ten qualify as straight philosophy. The\nrest are devoted to such topics as educational theory, international\nrelations, public policy research (with special reference to the\ndevelopment of technology), informatics, design science, religious\nstudies, clinical psychology, social economics, political economy,\nmathematics, the history of physics and the sociology of the family.\nThus Imre Lakatos was very much more than a philosophers\u2019\nphilosopher.\n\nFirst, we discuss Lakatos\u2019s life in relation to his works.\nLakatos\u2019s Hungarian career has now become a big issue in the\ncritical literature. This is partly because of disturbing facts about\nLakatos\u2019s early life that have only come to light in the West\nsince his death, and partly because of a dispute between the\n\u201cHungarian\u201d and the \u201cEnglish\u201d interpreters of\nLakatos\u2019s thought, between those writers (not all of them\nMagyars) who take the later Lakatos to be much more of a Hegelian (and\nperhaps much more of a disciple of Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs) than he\nliked to let on, and those who take his Hegelianism to be an\nincreasingly residual affair, not much more, in the end, than a habit\nof \u201ccoquetting\u201d with Hegelian expressions (Marx,\nCapital: 103). Just as there are analytic Marxists who think\nthat Marx\u2019s thought can be rationally reconstructed without the\nHegelian coquetry and dialectical Marxists who think that it cannot,\nso also there are analytic Lakatosians who think that Lakatos\u2019s\nthought can be largely reconstructed without the Hegelian coquetry and\ndialectical Lakatosians who think that it cannot (see for instance\nKadvany 2001 and Larvor 1998). Obviously, we cannot settle the matter\nin an Encyclopedia entry but we hope to say enough to illuminate the\nissue. (Spoiler alert: so far as the Philosophy of Science is\nconcerned, we tend to favor the English interpretation. We are more\nambivalent with respect to the Philosophy of Mathematics.)\n\nSecondly we discuss Lakatos\u2019s big ideas, the two contributions\nthat constitute his chief claims to fame as a philosopher, before\nmoving on (thirdly) to a more detailed discussion of some of his\nprincipal papers. We conclude with a section on the Feyerabend/Lakatos\nDebate. Lakatos was a provocative and combative thinker, and it\nfalsifies his thought to present it as less controversial (and perhaps\nless outrageous) than it actually was.\n\nNote: In referring to Lakatos\u2019s chief works (and to a couple of\nPopper\u2019s) we have employed a set of acronyms rather than the\nname/date system, hoping that this will be more perspicuous to\nreaders. The acronyms are explained in the Bibliography.\n",
