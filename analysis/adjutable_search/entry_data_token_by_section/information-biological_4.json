    "main_text": "Signalling systems\n5. Signalling systems\nIn section 2, we noted that Brian\nSkyrms\u2019 work on signalling systems has made this framework a\nvery natural fit for a quite large range of biological phenomena. As\nwe remarked above, it is very intuitive to see hormones such as\ninsulin, testosterone, and growth hormone as signals, as they are\nproduced in one part of the body, and travel to other parts where they\ninteract with \u201creceptors\u201d in a way that modifies the\nactivities of various other structures. It is routine to describe\nhormones as \u201cchemical messages\u201d. The Skyrms framework fits\nthese designed cause and response systems within biological agents for\nthree reasons. First, as noted, this framework shows that signalling\ndoes not require intelligence or an intelligent grasp of signal\nmeaning.\nSecond, the simplest cases for models of signalling are cases in which there is common interest.\nThe sender and receiver are advantaged or disadvantaged by the same\noutcomes. While complete common interest is atypical of\norganism-to-organism communication, the cells and other structures\nwithin an organism share a common fate (with complex exceptions). So\nin this respect the base models might fit organ-to-organ communication\nbetter than they fit between-organism phenomena.\nThird, in many of these biological systems, the abstract structure\nspecified as a signalling system\u2014environmental source, sender,\nmessage, receiver, response\u2014maps very naturally onto concrete\nbiological mechanisms. For example, Ron Planer has recently argued\nthat we should see gene expression as the operation of a signalling\nsystem (Planer 2014). His view is quite nuanced, for the identity of\nthe sender, receiver, and message vary somewhat from case to case. For\nexample, when a protein is a transcription factor, then the gene\ncounts as a sender. He treats other gene-protein relations\ndifferently. The details of his view need not concern us here. The\npoint is that there is machinery in the cell\u2014genes, proteins\nmRNA transcripts, ribosomes and their associated tRNA\u2014that can\nbe plausibly mapped onto sender-receiver systems. There is nothing\nforced about mapping the information-processing sender-receiver\nstructure onto the molecular machinery of the cell.\nHowever, while this framework very naturally fits within cell and\nbetween cell processes, it is much less clear how naturally other\nsuggestions mesh with this framework. For example, in the\nBergstrom-Rosvall picture of intergenerational transmission, who or\nwhat are the senders and receivers? Perhaps in the case of multicelled\norganisms, the receiver exists independently of and prior to the\nmessage. For an egg is a complex and highly structured system, before\ngene expression begins in the fertilised nucleus, and that structure\nplays an important role in guiding that gene expression (Sterelny\n2009; Gilbert 2013). But most organisms are single celled prokaryotes,\nand when they fission, it is not obvious that there is a daughter who exists prior to and\nindependently of the intergenerational genetic message she is to\nreceive.\nLikewise, Nicholas Shea\u2019s Millikan-derived analysis does not\nseem to map naturally onto independently specifiable biological\nmechanisms. For him, the sender of genetic messages is natural\nselection operating on and filtering the gene pool of a population;\nmessages are read by the developmental system of the organism as a\nwhole (Shea 2013). But the less clearly a sender-receiver or\nproducer-consumer framework maps onto independently recognised\nbiological mechanisms, the more plausible a fictionalist or\nanalogical analysis of that case becomes. So we see an important\ndifference between a reader being the developmental system as a whole,\nand reader being a receptor on a cell membrane. The cell-level\nmachinery of transcription and translation (the ribosomal/tRNA\nmachinery, especially) really is a reader or consumer of nucleic acid\nsequences, with the function of creating protein products that will\nhave a variety of uses elsewhere in the cell. But this realization of\nthe causal schematism applies only at the cell level, at the\nlevel at which the transcription and translation apparatus shows up as\na definite part of the machinery. One of the most extraordinary\nfeatures of ontogeny is that it proceeds reliably and predictably\nwithout any central control of the development of the organism as a\nwhole. There is nothing, for example, that checks whether the\nleft-side limbs are the same size as the right side limbs, intervening\nto ensure symmetry. Similarly, there are DNA sequence-readers, and some\nintercellular sender-receiver systems with clear \u201creaders\u201d\n(such as neural structures), but there are no higher-level readers\nthat interpret a message specifying the structure of a whole limb-bud in the embryo.\n",
