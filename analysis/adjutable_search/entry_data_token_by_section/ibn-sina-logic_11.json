Syllogistic\n\nThe culmination of Avicenna\u2019s formal logic is the development of\nan elaborate theory of the syllogism that brings together various\nstrands from ancient and late ancient logic, filtered through\nPeripatetic lenses, and produces a new and original system.\n\nThe theory of the syllogism (qiy\u0101s), in its main\ndivisions, occupies a prominent part in all of Avicenna\u2019s\nlogical works. The doctrinal skeleton remains the same in spite of a\nsignificant re-arrangement of the material, especially in the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t. In the works of the middle period,\nespecially the Na\u011f\u0101t and the extensive treatment of the\nQiy\u0101s, Avicenna follows the path charted by the\nPrior\n Analytics.[13]\nTypes of syllogisms: connective and repetitive\n\nAmong the several innovations Avicenna may be credited with is the\ncodification of a canonical division, echoing distinctions already\nbrewing in ancient and late ancient logic, of syllogisms in a number\nof categories that became standard conceptual vocabulary in later\nArabic logic.\n\nSyllogisms divide into two main types: (1) connective syllogisms\n(iqtir\u0101n\u012b) and (2) repetitive syllogisms\n(isti\u1e6fn\u0101\u02be\u012b).\n\nConnective syllogisms are defined as those in which neither the\nconclusion nor its contradictory is explicitly part of the premises,\nand hence as those syllogisms in which the conclusion is only\npotentially contained in the premises. Connective syllogisms are\ncharacterized by a partial overlap or sharing between the premises (of\na middle term or of a proposition discharged in the conclusion).\n\nRepetitive syllogisms are defined as those in which either the\nconclusion or its contradictory is explicitly part of the\npremises.\n\nFurther discussion of syllogistic arguments include the (i) compound\nsyllogism (qiy\u0101s murakkab), which involves multiple\nsyllogisms such that the conclusion of a syllogism serves as a premise for\nthe next syllogism, whether by an explicit concatenation\n(maw\u1e63\u016bl) or an implicit one\n(mufa\u1e63\u1e63al), as well as other forms that came to\nbe discussed, in later Arabic logic, under the rubric of concomitants\nof the syllogism (law\u0101\u1e25iq al-qiy\u0101s). These\nvariously connect to chapters of the Prior Analytics and include:\n(ii) the proof through the impossible or reductio ad absurdum\n(qiy\u0101s al-\u1e2balf or kal\u0101m il\u0101\nl-mu\u1e25\u0101l), which in Avicenna is interestingly\nanalyzed in terms of a combination of a connective and a repetitive\nsyllogism, (iii) the conversion of the syllogism (\u02bfaks\nal-qiy\u0101s), (iv) the syllogism from opposites (qiy\u0101s\u0101t mu\u02beallafa min muqaddam\u0101t mut\u0101qabila), and (v)\ncircular proof (bay\u0101n ad-dawr).\n",
