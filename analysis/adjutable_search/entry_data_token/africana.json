The Concept of Africana Philosophy\n\n\nThere are significant challenges to the viability of the concept\nAfricana philosophy as well as to an effort to map out an\nencyclopedic overview of the extended and still expanding range of\nendeavors covered by the term. Foremost are the challenges to ordering\nthrough a single concept the geographical, historical, socio-political,\nand cultural differences and complexities that have defined and\ncontinue to define the realities of life of the many persons and\npeoples identified as \u201cAfrican\u201d and \u201cof African\ndescent\u201d in many locales throughout the world. Yet, the viability\nof the concept is grounded on several centuries of continuous, linked,\ncomplicated histories during which Black peoples of Africa, and their\ndescendants, have been regarded as and engaged with, and more or less\nhave come to regard themselves, as \u201cAfrican\u201d peoples, as\npersons and peoples \u201cof African descent.\u201d The long\nhistories of this regarding, by others and by themselves, have thus\nconditioned substantively the history-makings, the socio-political\nlives, the culture-makings and culture-mediations, intellectual\nproductions and philosophizings included, of persons and peoples\nAfrican and of African descent.\n\n\nOn these socially constructive historical groundings rest several key\nheuristic presumptions that are central to Africana\nphilosophy as a metaphilosophical concept for organizing\nintellectual praxes. First, the presumption that there are sufficient\ndistinguishing anthropological, historical, and other commonalities\nand similarities that are shared, more or less, by the many\nbio-cultural groupings of human beings who have been identified, and\nwho subsequently generally have come to identify themselves, as, in\npart, \u201cAfrican\u201d or \u201cof African descent\u201d to\nwarrant ordering under a general heading particular instances of\nphilosophically articulate thought expressed by persons in these\ngroupings and shared with and debated by others within and beyond the\ngroupings. These identifications are consequences of the imposition on\nthe peoples of the continent named \u201cAfrica\u201d of an\nattempted homogenizing racializing ontology by peoples of\nnation-states on another continent that was named \u201cEurope\u201d\nin an aspiration for geo-political and anthropological\nunification. Many \u201cEuropeans\u201d came to believe that beneath\ntheir many formidable differences there was a foundational commonality\nthrough shared raciality and other constitutive virtues that was\ndefinitive of their anthropological and historical superiority as\nharbingers of a theologically and philosophically sanctioned destiny\nto achieve global predominance. It was out of this toxic mix of\nconvictions and aspirations that particular Europeans set about\nconstructing racialized, rank-ordered philosophical anthropologies\nthrough which they construed a continent of diverse peoples as a\nsingle \u201crace\u201d of \u201cAfricans\u201d or\n\u201cNegroes.\u201d The outcomes of the histories of these\ninventive forgings through complex, centuries-long struggles against\nEuropean imperialist impositions and the adaptive endurances of\ncolonization and dispersing enslavements by persons and peoples\nAfrican and African-descendant provide the warrant for the presumption\nof commonalities embraced by the concept Africana philosophy\nwhen considering the philosophizings of people African and\nAfrican-descended subsequent to their encounters with impositions of\nimperialism by people(s) of Europe and European Diasporas.\n\n\nThis first presumption is tempered by a second: namely, that the\nbio-cultural groupings of peoples African and of African descent are\nnot homogeneous, racially or otherwise, neither individually nor\ncollectively, but are constituted by differences and dissimilarities\nas well as by similarities and commonalities. All the more so as\nconsequences of the various groups having created differing\nlife-worlds in differing geographical, political, and historical\nlocations prior to and as a consequence of impositions and disruptions\nof their lives fostered by Europeans and others on one hand; and, on\nthe other, while living interactions and cultural exchanges with other\npeoples, European and European-descended peoples included, which have\ngiven rise to differences in individual and group genomes, histories,\ncultures, interests, and aspirations. Furthermore, identified shared\nsimilarities and commonalities are understood to be\ncontingent, thus neither necessary nor inherent and fixed and\nthus the same for all persons African or of African descent. This\npresumption rules out any ahistorical, a priori claims regarding\nsupposedly definitive \u201cnatural\u201d characteristics of\n\u201cthe\u201d thought of African and African-descended\npeoples assumed as non-contingently widely and generally shared across\nextended historical times and geo-cultural spaces. Africana\nphilosophy as an ordering concept, then, is neither the promise\nof, nor an aspiration for, a unifying philosophy already shared, or to\nbe shared, by all properly thoughtful persons African and/or of African\ndescent. Judgments regarding the always-contingent distinguishing\nfeatures of philosophizing thought and expression by persons African\nand of African descent, and of the extent to which such features are\nshared\u2014to what degree, under what circumstances, to what\nends\u2014are to be achieved by way of combined efforts of\nphilosophical anthropology, sociology of knowledge, and intellectual\nhistories: that is, by way of historically and socio-culturally\nsituated comparative studies of instances of philosophizing.\n\n\nA third presumption: Africana philosophy should not be\nregarded as normatively prescriptive for philosophers identified as\nAfrican or of African descent, as setting requirements for what their\nphilosophizing must have been, or must be, about and to what ends\nbecause of their racial/ethnic identities. Such identities neither\nconfer nor require particular philosophical commitments or obligations.\nSubstantive differences among African and African-descended thinkers\nhave been, and must continue to be, acknowledged and taken into account\nin the ordering of the field and setting agendas for Africana\nphilosophy. There have been, are, and will likely continue to be\npersons African and of African descent for whom their identities as\nsuch are of no import for their philosophizing.\n\n\nOf particular importance, work in Africana philosophy is also\nconditioned by the presumption that contributors need not be persons\nAfrican or of African descent. This presumption rests on the\nunderstanding that the conditioning circumstances, motivations, modes,\nagendas, and importance of the philosophically articulate thought and\naesthetic expressions of persons African and of African descent can be\nidentified, understood, researched, taught, commented on, and taken up\nwith respectful competence by persons neither African nor of African\ndescent. By virtue of their competencies such persons may be identified\nappropriately as, for example, \u201cAfricanists\u201d or\n\u201cAfro-Caribbeanists\u201d or \u201cAfrican\nAmericanists.\u201d\n\n\nFinally, the extent to which these heuristic presumptions are cogent\nand effective in guiding work in Africana philosophy is a matter that\nis to be continuously explored and tested in the agora of disciplined,\nethical scholarship and thus confirmed or disconfirmed, to whatever\nextent appropriate, in accord with proper methods of critical review\nproperly deployed.\n2. Philosophizings Born of Struggles: Conditions of Emergence of Africana Philosophy\n\n\nThe metaphilosophical efforts to map out and order a complex\ndiscursive field of articulations and practices as Africana\nphilosophy are, indeed, emergent disciplinary ventures of\nthe late twentieth century. However, many of the instances of\nthoughtful articulation and aesthetic expressiveness that are being\nidentified and explored as instances of philosophizing were neither\nproduced nor guided by norms and agendas of the discipline of academic\nphilosophy as institutionalized for centuries in various countries of\nWestern European and North America. The same is true for the needs,\nmotivations, objectives, and many of the principal intellectual\nresources that motivated and oriented those instances of articulation\nand creative expression and the formation of the networks of\nidea-spaces and discursive communities that nurtured them. For African\nand African-descended peoples were of little or no philosophical or\nanthropological significance to those who have been the designators,\nhistorians, practitioners, and mediators of the discipline\u2019s\ninstitutionalized canons of issues, figures, agendas, conceptual and\nmethodological traditions, problem-sets, texts or text-analogs,\norganizations, and institutions. The pre-Modern histories of African\nand African-descended peoples; the centuries-long colonized, enslaved,\nand otherwise utterly dehumanizing unfreedom of Black peoples\nthroughout the continents of Africa, Europe, the Americas, and the\nCaribbean; the rapacious unjust exploitation of their bodies, lands,\nresources, and life-opportunities\u2014all of these went mostly\nwithout explicit comment in the discipline of Philosophy, not even as a\nfocus of protest, notwithstanding all of the vaunted concern within the\ndiscipline for conceptions of freedom, justice,\nequality, human nature, and human well-being\ngenerally. Even as European and European-descended philosophes\nof the eighteen, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries fashion decidedly\nnew philosophical anthropologies, socio-political philosophies, and\nphilosophies of histories into complex Enlightenments to ground and\nguide quests to realize the global instantiations of Modernities in\nwhich reason-guided freedom and justice would be foundational to the\nspread of the racialized, capitalist civilizational projects of\nEurocentrism (Amin 1989), there was almost total silence about the intended and\nunintended consequences for peoples African and of African\ndescent\u2014except for claims that colonization and enslavement would\nbring them much needed \u201ccivilizing.\u201d\n\n\nEvolving academic, and subsequently professionalized, Philosophy\nthus aided and abetted, and was a substantial institutionalized\nbeneficiary of, these projects well into the twentieth century when the\nvarious forms and movements of resistance of African and\nAfrican-descended peoples to dehumanization were made more challenging\nwhile animated by motivating declarations of their claims to their\nhumanity and their rights to freedom, justice, and full citizenship. By\nthe middle of the twentieth century, throughout Africa, the Caribbean,\nand the Americas these movements had won major victories of liberation\nfrom the oppressive regimes of Eurocentric racial apartheid and\nexploitation. The movements were also contributing to progressive\ntransformations of these regimes that helped to open them to\nsubstantive measures of real freedom and justice not only for persons\nand peoples African and of African descent, but for other persons and\npeoples of color and, even, for women of European descent.\n\n\nThese historic movements and developments provided contemporary\npioneers of Africana philosophy rich, exemplary ideas, idea-spaces,\nagendas, and social networks on which to draw for motivations,\nmissions, and other resources to forge intellectual agendas and\nstrategies and social networks needed for philosophizing in the\ninterests of people African and of African descent. Hence, the\ntwentieth-century emergence of Africana philosophy as an international\nfield of and for discursive intellectual and expressive aesthetic work\nwith a distinctive mission: to gather up and explore critically\nthoughtful articulations and aesthetic expressions by and about persons\nand peoples African and of African descent as instances of\nphilosophizing; and to fashion revised or new articulations and artful\nexpressions in keeping with, and as aids to, quests for freedom,\njustice, and human dignity by and for these persons and peoples.\n\n\nExamples of such mission-driven creative intellectual and expressive\nwork in service to the liberation and redemption of Black peoples were\nalready at hand in several other disciplines: in history and sociology,\nmusic and literature, art and dance, religion and theology. Moreover,\noutside of academic disciplines, many among several generations of\nfiercely independent, extraordinarily formally and informally educated\n(and in some instances self-taught) socially, politically, and\naesthetically engaged female and male black intellectuals and artists,\nwho devoted much of their lives to service as uplifters of Black\npeoples, had pursued their often very highly productive, and certainly\nvery influential, intellectual and expressive work without ongoing\naffiliations with institutions of higher education, and without the\nassistance of sources of support for articulation and expression, that\nwere dominated and controlled by Europeans and people of European\ndescent. This independence was crucial to the production of their\nseminal reflections, articulations, and artistic creations and\nexpressions. Many of them helped to found and were affiliated with and\nsupported by religious and educational institutions, character-building\nwomen\u2019s and men\u2019s clubs and literary societies;\ninternational missionary ventures; benevolent and political\norganizations; publishing and commercial enterprises; and with local,\nregional, and international anti-colonial and liberatory organizations\nfounded and operated by and devoted to the uplift, freedom, and\nwell-being of African and African-descended peoples. As inspiring role\nmodels, much of their work became resource-reservoirs for new\ngenerations of women and men determined to continue the quests for\nliberation and justice for Black peoples. A matter of significant\ninfluence was that many of these important figures had become\ninternationalists in understanding the similarities and commonalities of\nthe plights suffered by African and African-descended peoples due to\nthe shared agendas for racialized oppression and exploitation forged\nand fostered by White peoples of various nation-states. Consequently,\nmore than a few of the new generations of twentieth-century African and\nAfrican-descended fighters for freedom and justice cultivated\ninternationalist, \u201cPan African\u201d (Geiss 1974) understandings of and\naspirations for what would be needed in the way of intellectual\nresources and strategies to assist with claiming and realizing the full\nhumanity of and just freedom for African and African-descended\npeoples.\n\n\nMany of the contemporary disciplinary pioneers of the\nphilosophizings that are now being gathered under the umbrella of\nAfricana philosophy, though participants in institutionalized,\nprofessional philosophy, have also been intellectual and spiritual\nmembers of the new generations of freedom fighters or otherwise\nsubstantially influenced by them. Thus, many have drawn their\nmotivations, aspirations, and resources for philosophical work from\nbeyond the canonized motivations and traditions of thought\ninstitutionalized in the discipline. Energized and emboldened by the\nlegacies of the role models and liberatory movements, they have taken\non the work of challenging the discipline in order to create room\nwithin its intellectual and organizational structures and processes\nwherein they could pursue agendas of giving consideration to matters of\nphilosophical import to persons and peoples African and of African\ndescent, and of particular import to themselves as persons African and\nof African descent engaged in philosophizing formally and\nprofessionally.\n\n\nAmong the challenges was the need, first, to reconsider\nlong-prevailing defining assumptions regarding the nature of properly\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d thought: namely, that such thought is\ncharacterized by a loving quest for wisdom pursued by persons who have\nthe most highly cultivated forms of disciplined thought, and whose\nlives are materially conditioned such that they have the leisure to\ndevote substantial amounts of their time and energy to reflective\nthought and to working out their thinking for articulate,\nsystematic expression in writing.\n\n\nIt became apparent to many\u2014though by no means to all\u2014of\nthe contemporary pioneers of Africana philosophy within academic\nphilosophy that this image of the ideal philosopher was not appropriate\nfor respectfully identifying or characterizing many of the\nphilosophically thoughtful and expressive persons African and of\nAfrican descent, those, especially, who lived several centuries ago.\nCertainly, throughout the centuries of radically disruptive and\ndehumanizing encounters between peoples African and of African descent\nand peoples of Europe and of the Euro-Americas, and others, the\nphilosophizing efforts of Black people have, indeed, been \u201cborn\nof struggle,\u201d as the philosopher Leonard Harris has so aptly\nnoted. The experiences, thus the philosophizing, of many of these\npersons\u2014and of generations of millions who were their\ncontemporaries, millions more who came before them, and millions more\nwho came after them\u2014were conditioned profoundly by racialized and\ngendered exploitative settler-colonialism in their homelands; for\nothers by racialized and gendered capture, relocation, enslavement, and\noppression in The New World thousands of miles from their or\ntheir ancestors\u2019 homelands; and in all such cases by racialized\nand gendered imperialist encroachments on the very core of their\nbeing by which they were forced to become and to be colonized\n\u201cnatives\u201d and slaves, ontologically as well as\nsocio-economically. Survival and endurance of such conditions by those\nwho managed to do so required coordinated efforts of recovery and\nretention, or the recreation, of the integrity of personhood and\npeoplehood, even of basic humaneness, thus required thoughtful\nontological and political work of the most fundamental significance.\nSo, too, crucial intellectual efforts of the kinds designated moral,\nethical, epistemological, social, religious, theological, and\naesthetic.\n\n\nThus, survival and endurance of conditions of racialized and\ngendered colonization, enslavement, and oppression\u2014not conditions\nof leisured freedom\u2014compelled more than a few African\nand African-descended persons to philosophize. Almost daily, even on\nwhat seemed the most mundane of occasions, oppressed Black people were\ncompelled to consider the most fundamental existential\nquestions: Continue life during what would turn out to be\ncenturies-long colonization and enslavement, of brutal, brutalizing and\nhumiliating gendered and racialized oppression? Or, seek\n\u201cfreedom\u201d in death? Suffer despair until mad? Or, find\nresources for continued living through surreptitiously nurtured\nappreciations of the sacred and beautiful, of irony and tragic comedy,\nwhile cultivating hope and patience aided by discoveries and creations\nof beauty and humaneness in the midst of the physical and\nsoul-distorting psychological brutalities of enforced impoverishments\nof conditions that were not in any way \u201cmundane\u201d living?\nDie at one\u2019s own initiation? Or, capitulate to dehumanization?\nOr, struggle to find and sustain faith and hope for a better life, on\nearth as well as in the afterlife, through creativity and beauty in\nspeech, dance, and song while at work and rest; in thought and\nartistry; in finding and making truth and right; in seeking and doing\njustice; in forging and sustaining relations of family and community\nwhen such relations were largely prohibited; in rendering life\nsacred?\n\n\nFor centuries, persons African and of African descent, for\nthemselves as well as for their associates and successors, have\nhad to ponder the most fundamental questions of existence as a\ndirect consequence of their life-constraining, life-distorting\nencounters with various self-racializing and other-racializing peoples\nof Europe, the Euro-Americas, and elsewhere. And in choosing to live\nand endure, peoples African and of African descent have had to\nforge, test out with their lives, and then refine and further live out\nexplicit strategies by which to avoid being broken by brutality and\nhumiliation and succumbing to fear, despair, or the soul-devouring\nobsession with vengeance. They have had to share with their\nassociates, and those succeeding them, their creative and sustaining\nlegacies for infusing life with spirit-lifting artfulness and their\narticulated ponderings and strategies for surviving, living, and\nenduring with hope despite the circumstances. They have\nhad to philosophize, and to share their philosophizings, in\norder to forge the cross-generational bonds of respectful,\nextended-family, community-sustaining love and mutuality without which\nneither survival nor endurance would have been possible.\n\n\nIndeed, endurance of gendered and racialized colonization,\nenslavement, and oppression that would be continued for centuries\nrequired very compelling, sustaining, persuasive beliefs and nurtured\ninvestments in finding and creating soul-nurturing art and\nexperience-verified praxis-guiding thoughtfulness. These beliefs and\naesthetic considerations had to be articulated and communicated for\nsharing, sometimes surreptitiously, in order that persons and peoples\nendure. And enduring required that the brutalities and humiliations had\nto be countered that were directed, first and foremost, at the defining\ncore of their very being\u2014that is, at their foundational\nnotions of themselves as persons and as distinctive, racialized\npeoples\u2014so as to bring about their cross-generational living of\nsocial death (Patterson 1982). This particular persons did, throughout Africa\nand African Diasporas, and without either the guidance or sanction of\nacademic Philosophy and the discipline\u2019s most canonical\npractitioners even as some among the latter subjected African and\nAfrican-descended peoples to their ontological racism.\n\n\nIt has been instances of such compelled, articulated thoughtfulness\nthat contemporary proponents of Africana philosophy have brought into\nthe discipline of academic Philosophy as the initial historic instances\nof philosophizing constituting the new field. The identification and\ncareful exploration of and commentary on the forms and efficacies of\nthis growing collection of works of thoughtful articulation and\naesthetic expression are now principal forms of endeavor in Africana\nphilosophy. The creation and expression of new articulations and\nexpressions of thoughtfulness by persons African and of African\ndescent, and by other philosophers not African or of African descent,\non these works as well as on old, continuing, or emergent issues\npertinent to Africans and people of African descent make for other\nforms of endeavor in Africana philosophy.\n\n\nThese efforts of recovery, exploration, commentary, and critique\nconstitute an ongoing project-of-projects with several agendas. A first\nagenda involves, as just noted, the identification and recovery of\ninstances and legacies of the \u2018philosophizings born of\nstruggles\u2019. Another very important agenda is the identification\nand recovery of philosophizings that were engaged in long before the\ncenturies-long struggles with peoples of Europe began. A third agenda\nis to learn from the philosophizings the lessons of the considerations\nthat governed or substantially conditioned the organization and living\nof life in the various circumstances in which peoples of Africa forged\ntheir evolutionary adaptations. Another agenda: to understand and\nappreciate fully those philosophizings that nurtured endurance in the\nface of brutalizing assaults on peoples\u2019 being in order\nto learn from the life-affirming, very passionate intellectual and\nemotional endeavors of those among severely abused peoples who have\nbeen, and continue to be, those who work at gathering themselves, their\npeoples, and even those who have abused them into humane integrity,\nindividually and collectively. It is to learn how and why it was and is\nthat from among peoples abused and degraded for centuries in conditions\nof continuous terrorism there have been steady successions of persons\nwho have spared substantial portions of the emotional and intellectual\nenergies they managed to preserve and cultivate, along with nurtured\nsenses of their sacred humanity, to devote to quests for freedom and\njustice, hardly ever to quests for vengeance.\n\n\nYet another agenda is to compare the philosophizings of persons\nAfrican and of African descent intra-racially and inter-racially, as it\nwere\u2014that is, to seek out the similarities and differences in the\nvarious instances and modes of thought and expression of persons\nsituated in similar and different times and places in order to learn\nmore about the forms and agendas of human species-being as manifested\nin philosophizing. An important consequence of pursuing this agenda\nshould be significant contributions to inventories of thoughtfulness\nand aesthetic expression in the storehouses of human civilizations,\ncontributions to the enlargement and enrichment of canons of Philosophy,\nand contributions to revisions of histories and of historiography in the\ndiscipline.\n\n\nStill another agenda is to make of Africana philosophy a collection\nof resources that inspire philosophizing, now and in the future, and\nthat guide such philosophizings by the best lessons found in the\ncollection, among them lessons in how to gain and sustain integrity of\nbody and soul, of person, of womanhood and manhood, of childhood and\nyoung-adulthood, of family and community, of \u201cracial\u201d and\ncultural being, of belief in the sacred sanctity of truth, of justice,\nand of freedom through the exercise of faith and\nhope-sustaining, pragmatically focused reasoning and creative\naesthetic expression in cross-generational conditions of\ndehumanizing brutality. Among the lessons to be relearned: how\nnot to abuse persons and peoples; how not to\nrationalize abuse; how not to live massive lies and\ncontradictions and lives of hypocrisy.\n\n\nWhat follows are brief surveys of several historically contextualized\ndevelopments of philosophizing now being explored as instances of the\nphilosophizing constitutive of the field of \u201cAfricana\nphilosophy.\u201d The survey is not meant to be exhaustive, but one\nthat provides examples and solicits additional contributions in order\nto make the account more comprehensive and accurate.\n3. Africana Philosophy: Continental Africa\n\n\nThe various peoples on the continent that came to be called\n\u201cAfrica\u201d had constructed a variety of more or less complex\nsocieties of varying scale and scope many generations before fifteenth\ncentury encounters with acquisitive explorers and adventurers from the\nvarying configurations of polities, regions, cities, and states that\nhave been identified as Europe and from elsewhere. Several of these\nancient societies\u2014the kingdoms of Mali and Ghana and the royal\ndynasties of Kemet (Ancient Egypt), for example\u2014had evolved\ncomplex social strata that included persons of accomplished learning.\nSome of these persons were stationed in institutions devoted to the\nproduction and distribution of knowledge and creative expression and to\nthe preservation of that knowledge and expression in written and\nartistic works stored in libraries and other repositories and, in the\ncase of works of art, incorporated into the ontologically-structured\nroutines of daily life. Others, in social orders in which advanced\nknowledge was produced and mediated via oral literatures and\ntraditions, were selected and trained to be griots: that is,\npersons with rigorously structured memories who thus became the living\nrepositories, guardians, and mediators of a people\u2019s and/or a\npolitical community\u2019s genealogies and intellectual legacies,\ntheir keepers of wisdom. And in order to preserve shared, adaptive life\nacross generations in all of the various social orders, it was socially\nnecessary to construct and maintain interpretive orderings of natural\nand social realities, as well of creatively imagined origins and\ngenealogies and constructed histories, by which to meaningfully order\nindividual and shared life.\n\n\nThe production of these interpretive and expressive orderings, the\nworking out of the norms by which to structure, justify, and legitimate\nthe interpretations so as to order personal and social life, were,\nindeed, \u201cphilosophical\u201d endeavors: labors devoted\nto the production of successful, time-tested, enduring thought-praxis\nand aesthetic strategies by which to resolve emergent and recurrent\nchallenges to transgenerational survival and flourishing. These were\nexperience-conditioned thoughtful means by which to provide knowledge\nto guide the ordering of meaningful individual and shared life\ntransmitted across generations past, present, and future. Such efforts\nare as old as the peoples now routinely referred to as\n\u201cAfricans.\u201d And the efforts were not destroyed by the\nholocausts of imperialist colonization and domination, nor by\nracialized enslavement and apartheid-oppression, fostered by Europeans\nand others. Still, the philosophizing efforts were disrupted and\ndistorted to various degrees in many instances, were creatively\nadaptive in many others.\n\n\nFor example, during twentieth century anti-colonial and decolonizing\nstruggles to regain freedom from the domination and authoritative\njurisdiction of white racial supremacy over the lives, lands, and\nresources of African peoples, the disruptions and distortions would\ncompel reinvigorated and determined adaptive creativity on the part of\nAfrican peoples who endeavored to recover and repair old, and/or to\ninvent new, agendas and strategies for living in keeping with their will\nto endure. There is a long history of efforts by scholars African and\nof African descent to reclaim Egypt from the intellectual annexation to\nEurope that was urged by Hegel in his The Philosophy of\nHistory. It is still the case that many people throughout Europe\nand the United States regard Egypt as being in \u201cthe Middle\nEast\u201d rather than as constituting the northern portion of the\nAfrican continent. This costly mis-education of popular imaginations\npersists, as well, in historical accounts of various areas of thought\n(though increasingly less so in historiography related to Africa). The\nsystematic production of ignorance and distorted, unethical\n\u201cknowledge\u201d about the peoples of Continental Africa persists\nin academic Philosophy, especially in the training of new\nprofessionals; in the writing of canonical histories of the discipline;\nand in the construction of disciplinary curricula though progressive\nchange has begun. Few in academic Philosophy not engaged in the work of\nAfricana philosophy are likely to know of a long tradition of\nscholarship contesting the claims of the Greco-Roman\n\u201corigins\u201d of Philosophy, an example of which is the\ncontroversial work by George G.M. James, Stolen Legacy (James 1954), in\nwhich he argues, as the title declares, that Greek thinkers\n\u201cstole\u201d Egyptian intellectual legacies that have since been\nattributed erroneously to Greek thinkers as their creations.\n\n\nA provocative and controversial argument, indeed. Still, widespread\ndisciplinary ignorance regarding the histories of ancient peoples and\ncivilizations other than those stipulated as being ancestors of\nEuropean White peoples is a direct and continuing consequence of racism\nin the formation, organization, and practices of communities of\ndiscourse and scholarship and the development of racially segregated\nidea-spaces, intellectual traditions and networks, and scholarly\norganizations throughout Europe and North America. For example, few\nacademic philosophers and workers in other disciplines who are neither\nAfrican nor of African descent are likely to know of the Association\nfor the Study of Classical African Civilizations, an international\norganization of scholars and intellectuals African and of African\ndescent who are determined to \u201crescue and rehabilitate\u201d the\nhistories, intellectual traditions, and wisdom philosophies of Ancient\nAfrica. Thus, few academic philosophers are likely to know of the\nscholarship of various persons in the Association such as Maulana\nKarenga (1986) and Jacob H. Carruthers (1984). Both scholars have contributed\nadditional research and scholarship to studies devoted to reclaiming\nEgyptian thought-traditions as African traditions of thought.\nThese scholars\u2019 efforts and works are paradigmatic examples of\nthe determined production and mediation of new knowledge of African and\nAfrican-descended peoples by African and African-descended, and other,\nscholars who have deliberately worked independently of the mainstream\norganizations of academic professionals in Philosophy and other\ndisciplines.\n\n\nWith little to no evidence in much of the canonical literature and\ncurricula of academic Philosophy that Western philosophers have focused\nattention on questions of historical relations between Egyptian and\nGreco-Roman thinkers, or on African thinkers and traditions of thought,\na number of the pioneers of Africana philosophy have turned to\nindependent, often controversial figures and scholarly projects outside\nof academic, professional Philosophy for their inspiration and for\nintellectual resources and strategies in taking on the challenges of\ncreating intellectual spaces in academic Philosophy for \u201cmatters\nAfrican.\u201d A major resource and intellectual mentor continue to be\nworks by and the person of Cheikh Anta Diop, the intellectually daring\nand pioneering Senegalese scholar who, in The African Origin of\nCivilization: Myth or Reality, published in the early 1970s,\nargued for the reality of the African origin of human civilization. Diop had begun the\nchallenging work of reclaiming African heritages decades earlier by\narguing in a dissertation submitted for the Ph.D. at the University of\nParis that ancient Egyptian civilization was a black African\ncivilization. His explorations in support of his claims have enormous\nimplications for revisions to histories of the origins of Western\nPhilosophy. Similarly, Martin Bernal\u2019s loudly and heatedly\ncontested multi-volume Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of\nClassical Civilization is by far the most widely read, and\nintensely debated, work in this vein to which many have turned.\nHowever, Bernal\u2019s work, which acknowledges a long line of African\nand African-descended scholars who are his precursors, Diop included,\nhas raised hardly a ripple in academic Philosophy. The discipline has\nthus long been overdue for a spirited and disciplined critical\nreconsideration of the possibilities and realities of informing\nGreco-Roman and African Egyptian contributions to the\nhistories of emergence and development of philosophical thought that\nhas been canonized as foundational to the genealogy of Western\nPhilosophy. Africana philosophy has been forged as a novel context of\nprovocations for such critical reconsiderations.\n\n\nMeanwhile, for several decades academic philosophers in Africa, and\nelsewhere, have been involved in intense debates and discussions that\nhave prompted reconstructions of disciplinary enterprises of Philosophy\n(departments in educational institutions as well as national and\ninternational organizations of professional philosophers). The initial\nfocal question at the center of the debates and discussions was whether\nor not there were proper instances of Philosophy in traditional (i.e.,\npre-Modern) Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular. The publication in 1945\nof Placide Tempels\u2019 La Philosophie Bantoue triggered\nmuch of the debate.\n\n\nThe historical context in which the debates and discussions emerged\nand in which they were waged was conditioned thoroughly by European\ncolonial domination and exploitation of African peoples rationalized\nthrough rank-ordering racial characterizations. This rationalizing work\nwas aided significantly by the intellectual efforts of canonical\nEuropean philosophers. David Hume, in a footnote in his \u201cOf\nNational Characters,\u201d philosophized about the \u201cnatural\ninferiority\u201d of Negroes to White people (Hume 1742) and was supported by\nImmanuel Kant (1764), who elaborated his own theory of inferior and superior\nracial types in his writings on anthropology (Kant 1798). Since successive\ngenerations of European and Euro-American White people had been\neducated into widely-shared common senses of their racial superiority\nto inferior Africans by such supposedly philosophically well-reasoned,\nscience-verified, and theologically sanctioned teachings, the claim\nthat there were Africans capable of producing thought of the caliber of\nPhilosophy was regarded by most of them as utterly preposterous.\n\n\nAt the core of the controversy was the pressing question\nwhether African persons were fully and sufficiently human and capable\nintellectually in comparison to the model human par excellence: the\nman of Europe, the White Man, the avatar for all White people\nand for humanity proper, whose defining characteristics were capacities\nfor reasoning and articulate speech (logos). Consequently, the\nclaim of Bantu Philosophy made by Placide Tempels, a Belgium\npriest engaged in missionary work in the then-called Belgian Congo,\nthat Bantu Africans (related ethnic groups identified by the dominant\nlanguage group, Bantu, spoken by the related groups) had an indigenous\nphilosophy was a serious challenge to the racialized philosophical\nontology-cum-anthropology that undergirded colonial domination and\nexploitation. However, Tempels tempered the unsettling implications of\nhis claim by also claiming that Bantu Africans did not have conscious\nknowledge of their philosophy. Rather, he claimed, it was he who was\nable, using the tools at his disposal by virtue of his training in\nPhilosophy, to engage in a hermeneutic of the practices and language of\nthe Bantu and extract the constitutive epistemology and axiology\nstructuring the operative, behavior-guiding philosophy at work in their\nlinguistic practices and normative actions.\n\n\nNonetheless, the impact of Bantu Philosophy was\nsubstantial. Of particular consequence, the debates it prompted helped\nto direct the attention of researchers and scholars in several\ndisciplines (anthropology, ethnology, history, religion, philosophy) to\nthe identification and exploration of the articulate systems of thought\nof various groups of \u201ctraditional\u201d Africans. A number of\nEuropean scholars and researchers who had spent years studying and\nliving among various African peoples were pleased to find confirmed in\nTempels\u2019 book their own positive assessments of Africans\u2019\nthought-systems, social organization, and artistic creativity. Others,\nhowever, disagreed and challenged Tempels\u2019 claims, in a\nparticular case criticizing him for mistaking an \u201cimpetus\nfor\u201d philosophy in the language and behavior of Bantu-speaking\nAfricans as evidence of a developed capacity for articulating a proper\nPhilosophy. This critic concluded that Bantu-Africans had not yet\nfulfilled the conceptual conditions for \u201ctaking off\u201d into\nphilosophizing properly (Crahay 1965). Other scholars engaged in comparative\nexplorations of thought-systems of various African peoples countered\nthe criticism by providing accounts of a number of such systems that\ngave clear evidence of their very capable and developed\nrationality (Forde 1954; Fortes 1965).\n\n\nThe subsequent decades of debates (mid 1940 through the 1980s)\nregarding the possibility of African philosophy and disclosures of the\nlong-developed rationality and humanity of African peoples were\nsignificant consequences for intellectual agendas and practices of\nrevolutionary developments in political arenas manifested in\nanti-colonial struggles throughout the African continent, and in\nefforts to construct new political, economic, social, and cultural\norders after the successes of those struggles. A significant number\namong new generations of African intellectuals\u2014many of them\neducated in institutions in Africa, many of which were administered by\npersons of European descent; and more than a few of them educated\nfurther in the most elite institutions of the colonizing \u201cMother\nCountry\u201d\u2014became radicalized in their opposition to\nracialized colonial domination and exploitation of African peoples and\nresources. A number of these engaged intellectuals regarded Tempels and\nsimilarly oriented European and Euro-American thinkers as allies in\ntheir struggles against the dehumanizing rationalizations that\nsupported European colonialism. Some regarded Bantu Philosophy\nas a defense, even a vindication, of Africans as rational human beings\nquite capable of managing their own lives and therefore capable of\nindependence from colonial rule. Others, however, thought\nTempels\u2019 claims, and similar offerings by others, were misguided\nand misleading candidates for proper instances of philosophical thought\nby Africans. For these dissenters such candidates were really more\nethnological studies of African peoples than philosophical\narticulations by them, and that their proponents were more\nmisguided in seeming to attribute unconscious, unwritten, and widely\nshared putative philosophical systems to all of the persons in the\nparticular groups under discussion. These dissenters disparaged such\naccounts as \u201cethno-philosophy.\u201d\n\n\nAfrican and African-descended intellectuals involved in and\notherwise supporting anti-colonial liberation struggles and\npost-colonial efforts to rehabilitate and further development new\nAfrican nation-states found in these raging debates intellectual\nweapons with which to reclaim, reconstruct, and redefine the histories,\npersonhood, peoplehood, needs, and future possibilities of African\npeoples. Life under exploitative, dehumanizing colonialism compelled\nintellectual and artistic engagements with prevailing conditions and\nspurred the nurturing of imaginative visions of possibilities of\nliberation and of how liberation might be achieved; whether and how\nmodes and agendas of life before the holocausts might be recovered,\nrestored, or adapted to new circumstances as thinkers and practitioners\nof the religious and theological, creative and expressive artists of\nliterature, music, sculpture, dance, and painting all grappled with the\nprofound existential challenges of the loss of personal and communal\nintegrity through the violent imposition of the conflicts of Tradition\nand Modernity and the need for liberation and freedom.\nTwentieth-century struggles on the African continent have thus had\nsignificant consequences for, and impacts on, creative intellectual and\nexpressive work in and with regard to continental Africa, and the\nAfrican Diaspora generally, in giving rise to widespread, prolific, and\nin many cases especially important articulations of social, political,\nethical, and expressive aesthetic thought and feeling. These\narticulations and expressions have become important object-lessons as\nwell as inspiring resources of agendas and critiques drawn on to forge\ndistinctive disciplinary enterprises of academic Philosophy. They have\nbecome, as well, the focus of informative critical thought for a number\nof philosophers focusing on \u201cmatters African.\u201d\n\n\nFor example, the Tempels-inspired debates over the possibilities for\nand nature of philosophizing by persons African became focused, for a\ntime, on discussions of the nature and anthropological distributions of\nmodes of rationality unique to philosophizing, discussions that quickly\nprompted intense debates about the universality or relativity of\n\u201creason,\u201d whether there were cultural (or racial or ethnic)\ndifferences in the nature or the exercise of reasoning, by persons\nAfrican in particular historical and cultural contexts in particular.\nPositions taken in these and other focal debates were developed from\nthe resources of a variety of traditions and schools of academic\nPhilosophy and other disciplines, including analytic philosophy,\nphenomenology, hermeneutical, and existential philosophizings, various\nmodes of social and political philosophy, and Afrocentrism.\n\n\nToday there are a significant and still growing number of formally\ntrained African philosophers throughout the world who draw on and\ncontribute to the discipline and profession of Philosophy. Explicit\ndevelopments of discursive formations, within and beyond the\ndiscipline, that are distinguished as being \u201cAfrican\u201d have\nbeen unfolding through efforts by persons African, African-descended,\nand not of African descent to identify, reconstruct, and create\ntraditions and repositories of literate African thought and artistic\nexpression\u2014oral, written, and in iconic forms of art\u2014as\nforms of philosophizing. An important development has been the taking\non for serious consideration the expressed articulate thought of\nparticular persons past and present who were and are without formal\ntraining or degrees, in academic Philosophy especially, but who have\nengaged in and articulated more or less systematic reflections on\nvarious aspects of life, and the inclusion of instances and traditions\nof such expressed articulate thought in revised and new canons of\nAfrican philosophical thought. An important leading example of efforts\nalong these lines has been the groundbreaking work of deceased Kenyan\nphilosopher H. Odera Oruka on the philosophical thought of traditional\nAfrican sages. Engaging in actual field work in Kenya, Oruka\ninterviewed and conversed with several locally recognized and respected\nsages and amassed a substantial body of transcribed, critically edited,\nand now published texts that are the focus of critical studies as well\nas motivations for more refined work of the same kind in numerous\nplaces on the African continent. Other philosophers, a number of them\nfrom other countries and not of African descent, have taken up\nOruka\u2019s lead and continue to explore the articulate thought of\nindigenous sages while incorporating the sages\u2019 articulations\ninto their research, scholarship, and course-offerings. \u201cSage\nphilosophy\u201d has thus become a subfield of energetic work in\nAfricana philosophy in continental Africa (Oruka 1990b).\n\n\nThe Tempels-inspired debates over whether African or\nAfrican-descended peoples have philosophies or can philosophize have\nbeen resolved\u2014or are no longer taken seriously\u2014and given\nway to explorations of other concerns. Both the anti-colonial struggles\nand the challenges of sustaining post-colonial successes and resolving\nsetbacks and failures have prompted much academic philosophizing. The\nevidence is the development of programs of study leading to advanced\nand terminal degrees in Philosophy with strong emphasis, in a number of\ninstances, on African philosophy in a significant number of\ninstitutions of higher education in several countries (Kenya, Nigeria,\nPeoples Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Republic of Benin, Senegal,\nSouth Africa); the appearance of a variety of journals and other\npublished (and unpublished) philosophical writings and other modes of\narticulate expression (literary works, especially); the development of\nnational organizations (in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt, and elsewhere)\nand international organizations (the Inter-African Council of\nPhilosophy and the Afro-Asian Philosophy Association, the latter with\nheadquarters in Cairo, Egypt, with members from throughout North\nAfrica, Sub-Saharan Africa, Turkey, Europe, and elsewhere) of\nprofessional philosophers and other knowledge-workers; and the\norganization of national, regional, and international conferences\ndevoted to explorations of topics and issues explicitly characterized\nas philosophical.\n\n\nThe continuing maturation of these developments is evident in the\nemergence of different philosophical orientations, agendas, and foci\nthat have, in turn, prompted several thinkers to endeavor to develop\ncritical, metaphilosophical overviews of developing schools or trends\nthat account for their emergence and implications, their similarities\nand differences. H. Odera Oruka (1990a) provided one such overview and\ndistinguished what he termed four \u201ccurrents\u201d in African\nphilosophy. One of these, already mentioned, he joined others in\nlabeling and characterizing as ethno-philosophy: that is,\nsecond-order works that purport to identify and engage in an exegesis\nof the philosophical schemes and significances of articulated thoughts\nand expressions, acts, and modes of behavior shared by and thus\ncharacteristic of particular African ethnic groups. Another current,\npreviously mentioned as having been initiated by Oruka, he termed\nphilosophic sagacity to distinguish what he regarded as the\nrigorous and critically reflective thought of independent-minded\nindigenous thinkers who were not formally educated in modern schools.\nNationalist-ideological philosophy for Oruka was constituted\nby the articulations of persons actively engaged in political life,\nespecially those who led or otherwise contributed substantially to\nstruggles for African independence and sought to articulate conceptions\nby which to create new, liberatory social and political orders. His\ndesignation for a fourth current, professional\nphilosophy, was reserved for work by academically trained\nprofessional teachers and scholars of academic Philosophy and their\nstudents.\n\n\nOther nuanced characterizations and examinations of trends in\nphilosophizing on the African continent have been developed. O. Nkombe\nand Alphonse J. Smet (1978) identified an ideological trend, quite\nsimilar in characterization to Oruka\u2019s\n\u201cnationalist-ideological current,\u201d that includes several\nvery rich lines of articulate socio-political thought devoted to\nreconstructing the political and cultural situations of African peoples\nthat were consequences of European imperialism, enslavement, and\ncolonization: African personality; Pan-Africanism; N\u00e9gritude;\nAfrican humanism; African socialism; scientific socialism;\nConsciencism; and African \u201cauthenticity.\u201d A second trend,\nthe traditionalist, includes efforts that are quite similar to\nOruka\u2019s sage philosophy in that the efforts are focused on\nidentifying philosophizing practices by traditional Africa thinkers,\nexploring the philosophical aspects of manifestations of these\npractices, and examining just how these practices resulted in the\ndevelopment of repositories of wisdom and esoteric knowledge. Nkombe\nand Smet identified a third trend: the intellectual orientations and\npractices of critical thinkers characterized by these\nthinkers\u2019 critiques of the projects of persons grouped in the\nideological and traditionalist trends structuring\ntheir critiques by norms and strategies drawn from familiar\nLeft-critical (Marxist), Liberal Democratic, and creative\nappropriations of other traditions of European thought. Thinkers in the\ncritical group applied the label\n\u201cethno-philosophy\u201d to a number of the instances of thought\nin the traditionalist trend to set apart the latter modes of\nthought, as previously noted, as more akin to ethnology than proper\nphilosophizing. Finally, Nkombe and Smet labeled a fourth grouping the\nsynthetic trend, one characterized by the use of philosophical\nhermeneutics to explore issues and to examine new problems emerging in\nAfrican contexts.\n\n\nStill other scholars have attributed somewhat different\ncharacterizations to these and other traditions or modes of\nphilosophizing in Africa and, importantly, identified newer\ndevelopments. An example of the latter is the pathsetting\nmetaphilosophical and anthologizing work of Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze, the\ndeceased philosopher from Nigeria who pioneered bringing into several\nidea-spaces and discursive communities of academic Philosophy in the\nUnited States and Africa the interdisciplinary writings of contemporary\nscholars and artists from across Africa, African Diasporas, and other\ncountries all of whom are significant contributors to\npostcolonial philosophizings. These are critical explorations\nof the challenges and opportunities facing Africans and people of\nAfrican descent in various national and transnational situations\ndefined by configurations of conditions after colonialism in\nwhich political liberation has not ended the suffering of African\npeoples, resolved long-running problems of individual and social\nidentity, or settled questions regarding the most appropriate relations\nof individuals to communities; of appropriate roles and\nresponsibilities of women and men and their relations to one another;\nof justice and equity after centuries of injustice and dehumanization;\nor of the most appropriate terms on which to order social and political\nlife (Eze 1997).\n\n\nThe heuristic value of the concept of postcolonial is not to\nbe underappreciated, for the various instances in which the successes\nof defeating the classical, directly administered colonial ventures in\nAfrica of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have been compromised\nby situations of indirect rule, or neocolonialism, effected through\neconomic control of the new African nation-states by Western European\nand U.S. American transnational capitalist enterprises and\nmultinational organizations and agencies supposedly providing advice\nand aid. These compromises must be fully appreciated in order to\nunderstand the prospects for full national independence and\nself-determination in the areas of economic, political, social, and\ncultural life generally. Of decisive issue is on what terms, via which\nstrategies, African countries will contend with emergent challenges,\nsome of which are of magnitudes and character neither encountered nor\nimaginable by \u201ctraditional\u201d African thinkers, or, even, by\ncontemporary thinkers. Foremost are the challenges from the scourge of\nHIV AIDS, which is proving to have as much impact demographically,\nthus in other areas of life, as were depletions of populations during\nthe centuries of export enslavement though with consequential\ndifferential impacts on age groups. Likewise challenging are questions\nof the priority and efficacy of armed struggle and the terms of\nengagement in light of recent and ongoing histories of such ventures\non the African continent, too many of which involve conscripting\nchildren into armies as armed warriors. Still other challenges: the\nterms and practices of political governance, at the level of the state\nespecially, as many African nations struggle against collapse or\ndebilitating dysfunction due to corruption, crippling economic\nexploitation, massive underdevelopment of human capital\u2014of\nfemales especially\u2014scarcities of food and other vital resources,\nand due to campaigns of genocide as ethnic affirmations coupled with\nethnic denunciations \u2018go imperial\u2019.\n\n\nScholarly efforts to develop informative and critical\nmetaphilosophical overviews of African philosophical trends, currents,\nand schools of thought, in part to forge new conceptions through which\nto take up these and other pressing challenges, are confirmation of\nthe rich diversity of formal philosophizing by academic philosophers\nand other intellectuals and artists that emerged on the African\ncontinent during recent decades, and of the continuing maturation of\ntheir efforts. A significant number of these intellectual workers,\nphilosophers among them, have cultivated international relationships\nwith other scholars and artists and their organizations; and some of\nthem have spent several years in, or even relocated to, the United\nStates, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, and other countries\nfor both formal education and to work in institutions of higher\neducation.  In the process of doing so many have also developed the\nprofessional relations, practices, and levels of accomplishment and\nrecognition that have led to the publication of works that are\ncontinuing to attract wider critical attention in various discursive\ncommunities and are being added to course and seminar readings. These\nmovements, relocations, cultivations of transnational relationships,\nand expansion of the literature of published works have enriched the\ndevelopment of new idea-spaces, the circulation of ideas, the\nformation of new discursive communities, and thereby contributed\nsubstantially to the development of Africana philosophy. There are now\nhistories of African philosophy and major collections of writings in\nthe subfield by professional African, African-descended, and other\nphilosophers published by major, transnational publishing firms\ncovering a still-expanding list of subject-matters organized, in many\ninstances, by themes long established in academic Philosophy:\nhistorical studies; issues of methodology, logic, epistemology,\nmetaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics; philosophy of religion; political\nand social philosophy (Hallen 2009; Kwame 1995; Mosley 1995; Wiredu\n2004). In several noteworthy instances, these philosophizings are\nconducted by way of deliberate explorations of articulations of the\nsettled thought structuring the life-worlds of particular ethnic\ngroups. Such explorations are being conducted in increasing numbers\nand, in the process, are rehabilitating and giving new meaning and\nheuristic direction to the once disparaged notion of\n\u201cethno-philosophy\u201d by establishing the legitimacy and\nresourcefulness of culturally and ethnologically contextualized\nstudies of articulated thought. As well, such studies will prove\nimportant for comparative studies of philosophizing (Bell\n2002). Hopefully, these efforts will motivate similar studies in other\nparts of the world, contribute to comparative studies that will\nenhance our understandings of philosophizing globally, and curtail\npractices of making false generalizations in some modes of\nphilosophical discourse, as, for example, characterizing the\nthought-endeavors of canonical Greek and European thinkers as being\n\u201cuniversal\u201d in their defining features or salience while\nbeing silent about the racial/ethnic, cultural, and gendered\ncharacteristics of the endeavors on the pretext that such matters are\nof no consequence for the thinkers\u2019\n\u201cphilosophy.\u201d\n4. African Philosophy: Contributions\n\n\nAs an ongoing project-of-projects, it would be unwise to attempt a\ncomprehensive and definitive catalog and assessment of the thematic\nfoci across the full range of articulations and discussions still being\ngathered and explored under the heading of \u201cAfrican\nphilosophy\u201d even as new discussions are emerging. Still, a number\nof developments are worth noting.\n\n\nSeveral canonical subfields of academic philosophical discourses\nstand to be enriched by the inclusion of explorations of\nsubject-matters within African contexts. As already noted, historical\naccounts of \u201cPhilosophy,\u201d in the so-called\n\u201cWest\u201d especially, are being reconsidered in light of\ncritical explorations of more recently disclosed relations between and\namong peoples and places in Africa and \u201cthe West\u201d or\nEurope\u2014among Greece, Rome, and Egypt definitely\u2014and in light of\nfurther explorations of the impact of such relations on even canonical\nthinkers in Europe. In general, the discussion of \u201cthe\norigin of philosophy\u201d in Ancient Greece must be replaced by\ncomparative explorations of the emergence of philosophizing in various\nsettings around planet earth, including pre-colonial North Africa,\nEthiopia (home of Zera Yacob and Walda Heyat, two seventeenth century\nphilosophers (Sumner 1976\u201378)), and places on the continent in which Arabic was a\nprincipal language.\n\n\nAs well, new questions should be posed and explored, among these the\nfollowing: How are canonical figures and subject-matters of the\nEuropean Enlightenments to be understood in light of the extensive\ninvolvements of European nation-states\u2014and of canonical\nfigures\u2014in colonial imperialism and the enslavement of African\npeoples? How did the centuries-long institutionalization of enslavement\naffect the philosophizing of various European thinkers with regard to\nnotions of freedom, the person, the citizen,\njustice, of manhood and womanhood? What was the impact on\ncanonical European thinkers of the presence among them of the\narticulated thought and the persons of such figures as Anton Wilhelm\nAmo (c. 1703\u20131758), a native of Ghana who, at age three, was\ntransported to the Netherlands to be educated and baptized in keeping\nwith colonial Dutch efforts to Christianize Africans? Amo settled in\nGermany and became a highly educated and influential\nteacher-philosopher. As more research and scholarship on such figures\nare completed, understandings of eighteenth century intellectual\ncommunities in Germany and elsewhere in Europe will have to be revised;\nso, too, notions of the meanings and influences of notions of\nrace and their impacts on intellectual productions as well as\non social life.\n\n\nWork in Africana philosophy in general, and African philosophy in\nparticular, compels comparative studies. No longer can it be presumed,\ncertainly not taken for granted, that many canonical notions, even\nso-called \u201cperennial\u201d or \u201cuniversal\u201d issues,\nhave the salience or global significance these issues have long been\nassumed to have. Conceptions of personhood in several indigenous\nAfrican schemes of thought (of Akan and Yoruba peoples, for example)\ninvite comparisons and rethinking of notions of personhood long\nsanctioned in some legacies of Western European and North American\nphilosophizing. For example, Kwasi Wiredu (1987) of Ghana has argued\npersuasively that in the indigenous conceptual-ontological schemes of\nthe Akan it would not be possible, in the normal course of matters, to\ngenerate the \u201cmind-body problem\u201d so central to the\nphilosophizing of Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Explorations of matters of\nlogic, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics in Akan and\nother schemes of thought will illuminate the extent to which Western\nEuropean and North American inventories of philosophical\n\u201cproblems\u201d will have to be revised. Likewise for\nexplorations in the areas of religion, aesthetics, politics, and the\nmeaning of social life.\n\n\nWhile there are near daunting challenges being faced by African\npeoples and other citizens of the continent\u2019s nation-states that\ncompel problem-solving philosophizing for enhanced living, there are,\ntoo, example-lessons of such engaged philosophizing that warrant close\nand appreciative study. One such example is the transformation under\nway in South Africa from the White Racial Supremacy of racial\napartheid to a multiracial, multiethnic democracy. A crucial factor\nconditioning the transformation has been the soul-wrenching work of\nthe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which sponsored public\nhearings during which victims of the evils of apartheid, and\nperpetrators of the evils, disclosed the truths of their suffering and\nof their dehumanizing aggression, respectively. Grounding premises of\nthe TRC project were that disclosures of the truths of\nsuffering and of abuse were necessary in order to\nachieve restorative justice, not just compensatory or\nretributive justice; and that restorative justice is in keeping with\nphilosophical notions such as ubuntu\u2014love, generosity,\nforgiveness\u2014that are foundational to communal life at its best,\nthus are essential to the rehabilitative healing that must be lived\nthrough in forging new persons for a new and democratic South Africa\n(Bell 2002, Chapter 5, \u201cAfrican Moral Philosophy II: Truth and\nReconciliation,\u201d pp. 85\u2013107). Here, then, a case-study in\nthe articulation and testing out of a new conception of justice, of\nethics more generally, in an African context, a case-study that should\nalready be substantively instructive.  Such comparative work in\nacademic Philosophy that engages seriously and respectfully\nphilosophical articulations of African and African-descendant thinking\nhas only just begun\u2026\n5. Africana Philosophy: The African Diaspora\n\n\nThe centuries of enslaving-relocations of millions of African\npeoples to the New Worlds of colonies-cum-nation-states\ncreated by European and Euro-American settler-colonists beginning in\nthe sixteenth century, and the subsequent centuries-long continuations\nof descendants of these African peoples in, and migrations of others\nto, these locales, occasioned the formation of new peoples of\nAfrican descent in the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, and elsewhere.\nIndividuals and groupings of these peoples developed and perpetuated\nshared creative responses to the impositions of various forms of\nsystematized racialized oppression and class exploitation motivated and\nrationalized by notions of White Racial Supremacy, and further complicated by\nconsiderations of sexuality and gender. In the New Worlds, as had\nbecome the case in Africa after the colonizing and enslaving incursions\nof acquisitive peoples from Europe and the Arabian peninsula, the\nrecurrent and decisive foci of life in the racialized crucibles were\nthe struggles to endure while resolving mind- and soul-rending tensions\nthat threatened and otherwise conditioned self- and community-formation\nand living.\n\n\nThere were several major sources of these tensions. One, the traumas\nof the radical dislocations experienced by the\nmillions of persons kidnapped and purchased into relocation to\nenslavement through terrifying transport across thousands of miles of\nocean during which many thousands died. Another, the soul and\npsyche-taxing ambiguities and ambivalences of being compelled to become\nand be, in important senses, both New World \u201cAfrican\u201d\nand \u201cAmerican,\u201d \u201cCanadian,\u201d\n\u201cBrazilian,\u201d \u201cPuerto Rican,\u201d\n\u201cTrinidadian,\u201d \u201cHaitian,\u201d\n\u201cJamaican,\u201d \u201cFrench,\u201d \u201cBritish,\u201d\netc., while, as slaves, being denied full access to the resources of\nthe prevailing meanings and practical realizations of the defining\nidentities of the most highly valued anthropological categorizations\nand social positions in the socio-political orders of the new states\nand locales as well as to the material resources crucial for realizing\nlives of well-being and denied full retention of and access to\nthe self-and community-defining resources of their natal cultures.\n\n\nHow the various African-descendant persons and communities resolved\nthese tensions conditioned the formation of new identities,\nlife-agendas, and praxes for living. Fundamental were the recurrent and\nvaried quests to survive and endure. With whatever\nsuccess there followed other fundamental recurrent and varied\nendeavors. Among the most compelling were quests to define and\nsecure freedom, quests that were profoundly affected by the\nabsence of any recourse to protections of law and by severe limitations\nimposed on Black peoples\u2019 participation in what has come to be\ncalled \u201cthe public sphere.\u201d Participation in this sphere\nwith protection of laws\u2014for example, to articulate one\u2019s\ncase for impartial and fair recognition and respect as a human being,\nparticularly as a woman or man of a despised race\u2014was hardly ever\nallowed in slave-holding polities, and very infrequently even in\nlocales where slavery had been abolished as invidious discrimination\nagainst persons of African descent continued. When speaking out or\notherwise expressing oneself on one\u2019s or one\u2019s\npeople\u2019s behalf was prohibited or strenuously circumscribed and\ncould be punished by beatings, imprisonment, or death with no legal\nprotection, the tensions were indeed wretched.\n\n\nThe variety of reasons for and means of coping in such\ncircumstances, and the variety of conceptions of life to be lived and\nof freedom to be achieved in the various New World locales, were\napproached differently by activist thinkers of African descent,\nconditioned by adaptive continuations\u2014more or less\u2014of some\nOld World African cultural agendas and practices. The efforts gave rise to\ndevelopments of different traditions of thought guiding the formation\nand pursuit of what would become, over time, a variety of agendas,\nfoci, objectives, and strategies of intellectual and practical\nengagement. It is these variegated, historically conditioned, socially\ngrounded, imperatives-driven thought and praxis complexes, immersed in\nand growing out of concerns and struggles for survival, endurance, and\nhuman dignity in freedom, that are being recovered and studied as the\nearliest instances of philosophizing by diasporic persons of African\ndescent and form the bases of the unfolding of several subfields of\nAfricana philosophy.\n6. African American Philosophizings Born of Struggles\n\n\nThe United States of America is one of several New World diasporic\ncontexts of focus for these recovery and study efforts that are being\nconducted under the heading of \u201cAfrican American\nphilosophy.\u201d What follows is a historically contextualized\ndiscussion of several instances of the emergence of philosophizings\nborn of struggles. However, it would be an ethical travesty and a\ncase of epistemological presentist imperialism to require that\nthoughtful, critically reflective articulations by African Americans\nconsidered as instances of philosophizing worthy of the critical\nattention of professional philosophers first meet rigorous, formal\nstandards for \u201cright reasoning\u201d settled on by professionals\nin the discipline during the late twentieth and early twenty-first\ncenturies. For the contexts in which folks of African descent were\ncompelled to reflect on and reason about their first-order lived\nexperiences were substantially conditioned by the agendas and social\nlogics of projects of White Racial Supremacy and constitutive invidious\nanthropologies of raciality, ethnicity, and gender, not agendas\ngoverned by the academic logics of abstract formal reasoning. The\npressing exigencies of daily, cross-generation life under racialized\nenslavement and oppression were what compelled reflective\nthoughtfulness, not leisured, abstractive speculation. Again, what has\nto be witnessed and appreciated across the historical and hermeneutical\ndistances of centuries of history and life-world experiences structured\nby contemporary personal and social freedoms are the natures of the\nlived experiences and situations of those whose articulations, whose\nphilosophizings, are considered as having been born of\nstruggles.\n\n\nMuch psychic energy had to be expended by New World African and\nAfrican-descended peoples contending with the institutionalization of\ntheir enslavement and oppression otherwise that was racialized,\nthereby naturalized, and thoroughly sanctioned and justified by every\nenterprise of deliberate, normative thought and aesthetic\nexpression\u2014law, science, theology, religion, philosophy,\naesthetics, and secular \u201ccommon sense.\u201d (For a historical\naccount of African-American life in the United States see Franklin and\nMoss, Jr. 2000.) In each case a primary resource was the foundational\nmetaphysical and ontological \u201cunit idea\u201d of a hierarchical\nGreat Chain of Being (Lovejoy 1964) on which each race was believed to\nhave a fixed and determining place. Accordingly, as\nliving property it was encumbered on enslaved Africans and\ntheir descendants to live so as to make good on the investments in\ntheir purchase and maintenance by engaging in productive labor,\nwithout compensation, and to endure and reproduce\nas ontological slaves in order to sustain and justify the\ninstitution of their imprisonment. According to this supposedly\ndivinely sanctioned philosophical anthropology, African and\nAfrican-descended children, women, and men were defined as\nconstituting a category of being to which none of the normative moral\nand ethical notions and principles governing civilized life\napplied. Pressed into an ethically null category, they were compelled\nto live lives of\nsocial death stripped of defining webs of ennobling meaning\nconstituted by narratives of previous histories, renewing presents, and\nimagined and anticipated futures of flourishing, cross-generational\ncontinuation.\n\n\nOn the whole, they did not succumb to the requirement to become\nsocially dead, certainly not completely, though many thousands did.\nAlways there were those who cultivated strengths of body,\nmind, soul, and spirit and exerted these in defense of the preservation\nof senses of themselves and of their peoples, of their\n\u201crace,\u201d as having worth beyond the definitions and\nvaluations set on them by rationalizations of institutionalized\nenslavement and oppression. Always there were those who, in\nthe cracks, crevices, and severely limited spaces of slave life and\nconstricted freedom, preserved and shared fading memories of lives of\nbeauty and integrity before the holocaust; who found, created, and\nrenewed nurturings of imaginings of better life to come through\nmusic-making, dancing, and creative expression in the artful fashioning\nand use of items of material culture, and in the communal and personal\nrelations, secular and spiritual, that the slaves formed, sustained,\nand passed on.\n\n\nNurtured by these efforts, they resisted the imposition of\nontological death and nurtured others in resisting. They reflected on\ntheir existence and the conditions thereof; conceived of and put into\npractice ways to endure without succumbing, ways to struggle against\nenslavement and the curtailment otherwise of their lives and\naspirations; and conceived and acted on ways to escape. They studied\ncarefully their enslavers and oppressors and assessed the moral\nsignificance of all aspects of the lives enslavers and oppressors led\nand determined how they, though enslaved and despised, must live\ndifferently so as not to follow their oppressors and enslavers on paths\nto moral depravity. They conceived of other matters, including the\nterms and conditions of freedom and justice; of better terms and\nconditions of existence and of personal and social identities; of how\nto resist and endure while creating things of beauty; how to love in\nspite of their situations; conceived of their very nature as living\nbeings \u2026\n7. 1600\u20131860\n\n\nThese considerations took various forms within and across the\ncenturies. More than a few African and African-descendant persons\nwould engage in concerted intellectual and practical actions directed against\nthe enterprise of enslavement in all of its forms. Their considerations\nand articulations can be found in various repositories of\nphilosophizings: in the lyrics and rhythmic structures and timings of\nvarious genres of music-making; in newspaper writings and pamphlets;\nin poetry and other modes of creative writing; in letters; in slave\nnarratives and autobiographies; in the legacies and documentary\nhistories of institutions, those of Black churches and church\ndenominations especially; in those of women\u2019s and men\u2019s\nservice organizations; in the documentary histories of conventions and\nconvention movements; etc. For from the earliest instances of the\nenslavement of Africans in the colonies in the 1600s and continuing\nthrough the 1800\u20131865 Civil War between forces of the Union of\nNorth and East and forces of the Confederacy of the South, militant\nagitation for the abolition of slavery was a prominent endeavor among\npersons of color both \u201cfree\u201d and enslaved, as were efforts\nto achieve greater respect and freedom for Black women from male\ndomination and oppression and from sexual exploitation as well as from\nracism. Phillis Wheatley (1753?-1784), a young, lettered house-slave\nin Boston, Massachusetts, wrote poems \u201con various subjects,\nreligious and moral,\u201d in one of which she expounded on the\nsignificance of \u201cBeing Brought from Africa to America\u201d and\nextolled Christians to remember that though Negroes be \u201cblack as\nCain,\u201d they, too, can be \u201crefin\u2019d and join th\u2019\nangelic train\u201d (Wheatley [1773] 1997). Aside from\nWheatley\u2019s highly polished and thoughtfully probing poetry,\nthe fact that she had penned the verses prompted such\ndisbelief that her master, and a prominent group of White men of the\ncity, including the governor and lieutenant governor of the state,\nfelt compelled to write letters to the publisher and the reading\npublic to attest that Wheatley had mastered the English language and\nwas, indeed, the author of the verses. Lettered articulation, in high\nverse no less, was a significant counter to claims of Negro\ninferiority, hence the need for legitimation of Wheatley\u2019s\nwritings by White persons of significant standing in order for those\nwritings to enter a race- and gender-constricted literary public\nsphere.\n\n\nWheatley was the first in what would become a long and continuing\nline of enslaved persons of African descent in the United States who\ntook up creative and other genres of writing as a means for engaging in\nresisting oppression and for reclaiming and exercising their humanity\nthrough thoughtful articulation. Slaves\u2019 narrations of the\nstories of their lives and of the conditions of enslavement and of their\naspirations and quests for freedom, constitute an extraordinarily rich\nbody of literature to be studied for philosophizings born of\nstruggles. Olaudah Equiano\u2019s The Interesting Narrative\nof the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African. Written\nby Himself (1789) is but one example of such narratives. Consider\ncarefully Equiano\u2019s recounting having to wrestle with and reclaim\nhis sense of self, even his name, after having been stolen into slavery\nas a child, transported to the New World, and being renamed\n\u201cGustavus Vassa.\u201d A profound and consequential instance of\nexistential philosophizing, Equiano\u2019s Narrative, one that discloses the significance of a\ncompelled struggle to reclaim and exercise a person\u2019s right, and\npower, of identification of self and social being\u2026\n\n\nFor a Negro, slave or free, to indulge in the articulation of\ncritical reflections on the nature of their being and the conditions of\ntheir life was a bold contradiction of prevailing characterizations of\nAfrican peoples and their descendants in the racialized ontologies of\nWhite Racial Supremacy, and a dangerous threat to the enterprise. David\nWalker (1785\u20131830) exemplified the threat. He sent shockwaves of fear\nacross the slaveholding South, especially, with the publication and\nwide distribution of his Appeal in Four Articles; Together with a\nPreamble, to the Coloured Citizens of the World, but in Particular and\nVery Expressly, to Those of the United States of America (1829) in\nwhich he advocated forcefully that Coloured people rise up in armed\nstruggle against their oppressors. Moreover, in articulating his\nprovocative appeal in a written document, Walker employed with great\nskill and impact a strategic use of rhetoric to gain leverage in the\npublic sphere: while ostensibly directing the Appeal to an\naudience of \u201cColoured Citizens\u201d almost none of whom were\nregarded as citizens and very few of whom, among those enslaved\ncertainly, could read and, if they could, would have been prohibited\nfrom getting their hands and minds on such an appeal, in truth was also\ndirected at White slaveowners and oppressors. This strategy would\nbecome a staple in the arsenal of discursive strategies Black folks would\nuse to engage in the work of articulating their considerations and\nadvocating for life-enhancing changes.\n\n\nFrederick Douglass (1817\u20131895), a passionate and indefatigable\nopponent of enslavement, the institution of slavery, and of the\nsubordination of women (\u201cWhat Are the Colored People Doing for\nThemselves?\u201d 1848; \u201cPrejudice Not Natural,\u201d 1849;\n\u201cThe Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered,\u201d\n1854), would use the strategy with superbly nuanced skill. An\nespecially brilliant thinker and prolific writer, he was also\nbrilliant in his oppositional eristic engagements over the\nconstitutional, biblical, and ethnological justifications of Negro\ninferiority and enslavement and over a wide range of other subjects,\nincluding the compelling need for appropriate education (directed at\npreparing the formerly enslaved for productive, economically\nself-sustaining labor), good character, and political equality.\nDouglass was an astute critical thinker and speech-maker, and was a\nforemost thinker with regard to such matters as the constitutionality\nof slavery, of the meanings of freedom and justice,\nand of the implications of both for enslaved, free, and freed Negroes\n(Douglass 1845).  Maria Stewart (1803\u20131879), likewise committed\nto freedom and justice for Black people, was a pioneering feminist in\nspeaking out publicly (\u201cReligion and the Pure Principles of\nMorality, the Sure Foundation on Which We Must Build,\u201d 1831) and\nthus took advantage of cracks in the public sphere to advance the\ncause for abolition and the liberation of women (Stewart\n1831). Sojourner Truth (Isabella Baumfree, 1797\u20131883) was a\nlegendary unlettered but unnervingly bodacious itinerant intellectual\nprovocateur who agitated for ending enslavement and the subordination\nof women (\u201cWoman\u2019s Rights,\u201d 1851). On one celebrated\noccasion, Truth walked uninvited into a Women\u2019s Rights\nConvention of assembled White people, sat down on the edge of the\nspeakers\u2019 stage until she simply had to be recognized, and then\ndelivered her now famous \u201cAr\u2019n\u2019t I a Woman?\u201d\nspeech (Truth 1851).\n\n\nIf slavery were abolished, what did the vocal Negro advocates think\nwould be the most appropriate modes and ends of life for Negro men and\nwomen?\n\n\nFor some it would or should involve assimilation, that is,\nprocesses by which one racial and/or ethnic group is absorbed by\nanother, for some physically as well as socio-culturally, with one\ngroup relinquishing its own racial and/or ethnic cultural\ndistinctiveness to take on the defining life-world character and\npractices of another. For early African American assimilationists this\nwould have meant accepting as appropriate and sufficient goals for\nAfrican American life the country\u2019s pronounced cultural, social,\npolitical, and economic ideals\u2014though generally without\nendorsements of the superiority of the White race\u2014as proof of\ntheir humaneness and of their having \u201crisen\u201d from a\ncondition of \u201csavagery\u201d to having become\n\u201ccivilized,\u201d particularly by having become\nChristianized.\n\n\nHowever, particular care must be taken in characterizing an engaged\nthinker\u2019s commitments and aspirations as\n\u201cassimilationist.\u201d While appropriate and useful in some\ninstances, in others the label is often misused or misplaced, for\nvarious thinkers were quite nuanced in articulating their positions on\nvarious matters: for example, in advocating assimilation of prevailing\neconomic ideas, principles, and practices while advocating social,\ncultural, and political independence for Black people. Douglass, one\nof the most well-known of African American cultural and political\nassimilationists, is an instructive example. He was not an advocate of\nthe assimilation of the Negro race into the White race; rather, he\npreferred, at the extreme, the assimilation of all distinct races into\na single, blended race, so to speak, so that there would no longer be\ndistinct races in which aspirations for super-ordination and\nsubordination could be invested. Similar views on cultural and\neconomic assimilation were articulated by T. Thomas Fortune\n(1856\u20131928), the journalist and advocate of Black unionizing and\npolitical independence (\u201cPolitical Independence of the\nNegro,\u201d 1884), and by the radical abolitionist Henry Highland\nGarnet (1815\u20131881), who at one point was convinced that\n\u201cThis western world is destined to be filled with a mixed\nrace\u201d (\u201cThe Past and the Present Condition and the\nDestiny of the Colored Race,\u201d (1848; 1996, p. 200), emphasis in\nthe original).\n\n\nOn the other hand, there were Negro women and men of the\nseventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries of enslavement for\nwhom the prospect of assimilating with White people in any fashion or\non any terms was to be firmly rejected. Such sentiments were especially\nprominent during the decades leading up to the Civil War as conditions\nbecame even more constraining for supposedly free-born and freedpersons\nwith the passage in 1850 of the Fugitive Slave Law that stripped away\nany legal protection for escaped and former slaves who made it to free\nstates by declaring it legal for any White person to apprehend any\nNegro who could not document their free status and return the person to\nenslavement. Garnet, responding to the circumstances the law created,\nis representative of those Black folks who became advocates of the\nemigration of Negro people to Africa. He was the founder of the African\nCivilization Society, an organization that promoted emigration of\nAmerican Negroes to Africa in keeping with a more positive agenda than\nwas the case with the American Colonization Society, which was\norganized by White people to foster the relocation of troublesome\nabolitionist free Negro people to Liberia, the colony founded with\nfederal support by White Americans intent on preserving the institution\nof slavery and White Racial Supremacy.\n\nEmigrationist considerations and projects thus became\nprominent ventures during this period, advocated with persuasive force\nby other very able activist thinkers, among them Edward Blyden\n(1832\u20131912), James T. Holly (1829\u20131911), and Martin Delany\n(1812\u20131883).  Delany\u2019s The Condition, Elevation,\nEmigration, and Destiny of the Colored People of the United\nStates (1852) was an especially well-reasoned critique of notions\nof citizen prevailing in the United States and a detailing of\nconditions affecting Colored people, including, in his estimation,\ntheir overreliance on \u201cmoral theorizing\u201d and not enough on\npragmatic political reasoning informed by comparative studies of the\nhistories of oppression of other \u201cnations\u201d within\nnation-states dominated by an antagonistic national (i.e., racial)\ngroup (Delany 1852; 2004). Based on his analysis, Delany was convinced\nthat people of color could not enjoy lives as full citizens with full\nrespect and rights in the United States. Hence, he reasoned, people of\ncolor should leave the country for South America\u2014though later he\nwould advocate emigrating to Africa\u2014to establish their own\nindependent nation-state. (However, when the Civil War erupted, Delany\nwas persuaded by Frederick Douglass, his former colleague in\npublishing The North Star newspaper, to join other Black men\nin forming a regiment to aid the Union forces in defeating the\nConfederate Army and the South\u2019s agenda for the continuation of\nthe enslavement and oppression of Black people.)\n\n\nIt is important to note, however, that emigrationists were often\nmotivated not only by desires to escape the various modes and\nintensities of disrespect for their racial being and humanity by\nrelocating to Africa, in particular, but also in order to fulfill\naspirations to engage in missionary work among native peoples on that\ncontinent in order to \u201craise\u201d them from\n\u201csavagery\u201d to \u201ccivilization\u201d through education\nand Christianization. Edward Blyden, for example, spent a large portion\nof his life engaged in educational and missionary work in Liberia.\nJames T. Holly, who advocated emigration to, and himself subsequently\nsettled in, Haiti and authored a lengthy work devoted to\n\u201cdefending the inherent capabilities of the Negro race, for\nself-government and civilized progress\u201d (A Vindication of the\nCapacity of the Negro Race for Self-Government and Civilized\nProgress, 1857), was a clergyman. So, too, was the indomitable\nQueen\u2019s College of Cambridge University-educated Alexander\nCrummell (1819\u20131898), who devoted twenty years of his life to\neducational and missionary work in Liberia and Sierra Leone followed by\nyears of pastoral work in the United States. Crummell (\u201cThe\nRelations and Duties of Free Colored Men in America to Africa,\u201d\n1860; \u201cThe Race Problem in America,\u201d 1888) was a formidable\nand very articulate thinker, author, speechmaker, and organizer with\ncommanding presence. He was a principal founder of the American Negro\nAcademy (1897\u20131924), a gathering of astute minds and engaged Negro men\ndevoted to analyzing the conditions of life of Negroes in the United\nStates, to determining how best to protect them from the continuing\nravages of centuries of enslavement, and to determining how best to\ndevelop the race to achieve political and social equality and economic\njustice.\n\n\nWorthy of critical exploration in the case of these figures: the\nextent to which, and on what terms, each of them embraced (assimilated)\nprevailing European and Euro-American conceptions of\ncivilization and the processes and conditions, states of\ncharacter in particular, by which a person or people could be said to\nbe \u201ccivilized.\u201d It is apparent in their writings and the\nlogic of their missionary work, in other lands as well as within the\nUnited States, that neither figure accepted the long-prevailing\narguments that the Negro race was inherently and ineradicably\ninferior. To the contrary, close scrutiny of their articulations will\nreveal that each was convinced that the civilizational inferiority of\ncontinental Africans, and of the ignorant, brutally constrained Negroes\nof deficient character in the United States, was due to conditions of\ndeprivation fostered by the enslavement and racism perpetrated by White\npeople. At the core of the missionary work of these men, and of many of\ntheir female and male contemporaries and successors, including persons\nwho worked at \u201cuplifting\u201d enslaved and freedpersons in the\nUnited States, was a principled and dedicated commitment to\nwell-reasoned and forcefully articulated belief in the God-given\nhumanity and inherent worth of persons of the Negro race, and fervent\nand equally dedicated belief in the ameliorative and progressive\nbenefits of education and racial independence. And each of these\nseminal figures took himself or herself as a living example of the\nactualization of the potentiality for substantial, qualitative\ndevelopment and advancement by Negroes, contrary to the\ncharacterizations of the race by those who rationalized and otherwise\nsought to justify enslavement and constrictions of the range of\npossibilities for Negro development. The articulations of a significant\nnumber of such persons have been preserved in the vast body of writings\ncontending with enslavement, with aspirations and quests for freedom\nand justice, with what a constitutionally democratic and multiracial\nUnited States of America ought to be in order to include\nColoured people as full citizens and fully respected human beings.\nTheirs are, indeed, philosophizings born of struggles.\n8. 1860\u20131915\n\n\nBeyond question, one of the particularly acute axial periods of\nhistory for people of African descent in the United States of America\nwas that of the half-decade of civil war (1860\u20131865) continued through\nensuing years of Reconstruction-struggles between White proponents of a\nculture of aspiring aristocratic genteel racial supremacy and a\npolitical economy devoted to developing industrial and finance\ncapitalism in the North and East of the country who also wanted to preserve\nthe federated union of states, and White proponents of a regional\ncivilization devoted to a decidedly pronounced and violently\naristocratic Southern hegemonic White Racial Supremacy based on a\npolitical economy of agrarian capitalism supported by enslaved Negro\nlabor, proponents who forged a Confederacy out of states that seceded\nfrom the Union in order to preserve their distinctive civilizational\nproject. For a great many Black people, the hope was that the Union\nforces would prevail in the war, the institution of slavery would be\nabolished, and they would be freed and free to enjoy lives of full\ncitizenship. More than a few devoted themselves, in various ways, to\naiding the Union efforts, some even as fighting soldiers. Frederick\nDouglass played a major role in persuading President Abraham Lincoln to\nallow Negro men to join the Union army as fighting soldiers and in\npersuading many men to join. With President Lincoln\u2019s\nissuance of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 freeing the slaves in\nthe Confederate states and Union victory in the Civil War two years\nlater, the day of Jubilation! for Black people and other\nopponents of the institution of slavery appeared to be at hand.\n\n\nAnd so it seemed. There followed a brief, euphoric period of statutory\nfreedom during which Black people held elective and appointive offices\nin many states that had been part of the Confederacy and otherwise\nmade initial significant gains in other areas of life.  However, a\npost-war (1877) so-called compromise between Republican economic and\npolitical forces in the North and East and those of Democrats in the\nSouth settled a disputed presidential election (a contest Republican\nRutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden) and allowed a South\nnot completely vanquished by the lost war to regain power in its\nregion in exchange for Republican hegemony in the federal\ngovernment.\n\n\nViolent terrorism and brutal repression of Negroes followed\nimmediately, in the South especially, which spawned two decades (mid\n1860s-1880s) of post-Reconstruction struggles by newly-emancipated\nBlack people to survive conditions in which they had been set adrift by\nmany former allies in the North and East and were being pressed back\ninto near-slavery by forces in the South. A Great Migration ensued as\nhundreds of thousands of Negroes left the South for hoped-for better\nopportunities without racial violence in the East, North, Southwest,\nand West of the United States, in some cases in response to persuasive\narticulations by various spokespersons (Edward W. Blyden, James T.\nHolly, and Alexander Crummell, among others) who renewed calls for\nvarious programs of emigration or what some scholars have termed\nseparatist Black Nationalism: migrations within and out of the\ncountry to sites on which all-Black communities and towns would be\nformed (away from the United States in Africa; within the country in\nKansas and Oklahoma, for example).\n\n\nMigrations within the United States were by far the most significant\nof the relocations. And the movements greatly accelerated over the\ndecades as the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth and the\nU.S. American economy was undergoing transformation into an industrial\ngiant and international power as a consequence of meeting the needs of\nproduction to support the country\u2019s participation in the First\nWorld War and other developments. In the North, Northeast, and West of\nthe country this industrialization created historic demands for workers\nand, subsequently, historic opportunities for work. Meanwhile, in the\nSouth rapidly increasing mechanization in agriculture and subsequent\ndecreasing reliance on the labor of nearly-enslaved, hyper-exploited\nNegro tenant farmers and workers, and increasing industrialization in\nthe region, left the greater majority of Black people in dire straits.\nThese developments, combined with hopes for life unrestricted by racial\nsegregation enforced by brutal violence, by lynchings especially,\nexerted additional pull-and-push forces that prompted hundreds of\nthousands to join in the migrations to the country\u2019s industrial\ncenters.\n\n\nIn settling in the new locales, the migrants and their subsequent\ngenerations began to undergo what, with hindsight, became a historic\nand wrenching transformation of what had been, for the most part, a\nbrutally oppressed, illiterate, yet resolute agrarian peasantry into an\nethno-racial urban working class, and the transformation of a\nsignificant few of them into a modern middle class. With the\ntransformations came vexing challenges and opportunities. Among the\nmost compelling needs were for forms of life appropriate to the new\nurban circumstances\u2014as well as for those who remained in the\nrebuilding South\u2014that would sustain the person and a people and\npromote flourishing life in conditions of intense competition with\nother ethno-racial class groups, and high risks of social\ndisintegration and failure as invidious racism, unchecked by federal\nrestraints, became ever more intense and widespread. There were, then,\ncompelling needs for social and cultural as well as economic support as\nnuclear and extended family units were disrupted in being stretched\nacross long miles of migration and crucial forms of communal and\norganizational support that helped to sustain life in the South were in\nvery short supply in the new urban centers. Once again, in the context\nof demanding needs to be met in the struggle to survive and endure,\nparticularly thoughtful and articulate Black persons took up the\nchallenges of conceiving what was best to be done for the well-being of\nthe race, and how best to achieve well-being.\n\n\nAfrican American women were especially prominent in endeavoring to\nattend thoughtfully and pragmatically to the well-being of the race,\nbut also in endeavoring to make good for Black women on the promises\nof Emancipation for social, political, and economic freedom. An\nexemplary figure in this regard is Anna Julia Cooper (1859?-1964), who\ngraduated from Oberlin College in 1884 and, at age sixty-five,\ncompleted a doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne on Slavery and\nthe French Revolutionists, 1788\u20131805 (Cooper 1925). A\ncareer educator before earning her doctorate, Cooper was a pioneering\nfeminist who set out a provocative view of what she regarded as the\nsuperior capacity of women to lead the reformation of the human race\nin her book A Voice from South (1892). Poet, journalist,\nnovelist, and essayist Frances Ellen Watkins Harper (1825\u20131911)\nweighed in with a forceful argument that the \u201cspiritual\naid\u201d that women can provide is crucial for moral development and\nthe social advancement of the human race (\u201cWoman\u2019s\nPolitical Future,\u201d 1893). Memphis, Tennessee-born and Oberlin\nCollege-educated Mary Church Terrell (1863\u20131954) lived a stellar\nlife of articulate leadership in uplift and advocacy organizations\ndevoted to the development and well-being of Colored women (Colored\nWomen\u2019s League, the National Association of Colored Women),\ncommitments articulated in \u201cThe Progress of Colored Women\u201d\n(1898, published 1904) and other writings. Fluent in several\nlanguages, Terrell forged relations with Negro and other women in\nseveral countries who worked for reforms on behalf of women.  And\nparticular note must be taken of the audacious, pistol-totting Ida\nB. Wells-Barnett (1862\u20131931), an investigative journalist and\nnewspaperwoman who took it upon herself, as an anti-lynching crusader,\nto investigate cases of lynching across the country to document the\nfacts of each case, which she published in 1895 as The Red Record:\nTabulated Statistics and Alleged Causes of Lynching in the United\nStates with an introductory letter from Frederick Douglass, with\nwhom she collaborated in many endeavors. During an especially violent\nand trying period, courageous, thoughtful, and articulate activist\nBlack women such as Wells-Barnett, Cooper, Terrell, and others\ninitiated what would become a long and varied tradition of feminist\nphilosophizing and work by women of African descent devoted to the\nenhancing development of Negro persons, families, organizations, and\ncommunities.\n\n\nFew of these thoughtful feminists, it should be noted, were energetic\nadvocates of Nationalist emigration during this turbulent\nperiod. Perhaps because many Nationalist agendas and articulations\nwere soon eclipsed (though by no means completely silenced) during the\nyears of 1880\u20131915 that came to be largely dominated by the\npersuasive ameliorative leadership of Booker T. Washington\n(1856\u20131915), an educator and strategic power-broker who focused\nhis considerable efforts on uplifting a Black southern peasantry into\neducated literacy for economic self-reliance and on the nation-wide\norganization of Negro businesses for the pursuit of predominance in\ncertain sectors of the economy. After delivering a poignant and crafty\ninvited \u201cAtlanta Exposition Address\u201d to resounding praise\nduring an 1895 international industrial exposition, Washington,\nalready well on his way as a leader recognized as such by Negro\npeople, was elevated by certain powerful and influential White people\nto the vaunted position as their leader and spokesman for\n\u201cthe Negro\u201d to whom they would turn to broker matters in\nrace relations. The key to this positioning was the reaction of many\nWhite people, concerned about post-war transformations under way in\nrace relations, to the following declaration in Washington\u2019s\nExposition address: \u201cIn all things that are purely social we can\nbe as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things\nessential to mutual progress\u201d (Washington 1895; 1992, p. 358).\nConcentrating on the first part of his statement, anxious White people\ninterpreted his public endorsement of the \u201cpurely social\u201d\nseparation of the races as an endorsement by Washington of the\nhegemony of White people in all areas.\n\n\nIt was not. In fact, Washington was explicit in the address in\ndeclaring that it was \u201cimportant and right that all privileges\nof the law be ours\u2026\u201d He went further in articulating a\nvision of \u201cthat higher good, that, let us pray God, will come in\na blotting out of sectional differences and racial animosities and\nsuspicions, in a determination to administer absolute justice, in a\nwilling obedience among all classes to the mandates of law\u201d\n(Washington 1895; 1992, p. 359).  Hearing, apparently,\nwhat they wanted to hear, not the fullness of\nwhat Washington wanted them to hear, anxious White people of\npower and influence certified him a \u2018good and safe\u2019 Negro\nand promptly made him their go-to Negro designated by them as\n\u201cthe Leader of the Negro people.\u201d Washington\naccommodated them, in service to his own ego as well as in service to\nthe benefit of the Negro race (by his own reasoning, of course). He\nwas brilliantly skillful in executing a nuanced, pragmatic strategy of\nwearing a mask of seeming accommodation to White hegemony as\nhe promoted Negro empowerment and self-sufficiency through education\nthat stressed disciplined comportment, thrift, industrial and\nagricultural work, and ownership of property (and while clandestinely\nsupporting securing political equality for Negroes). As an enlarged\nfigure who brokered the largesse and influence of White people flowing\nto Negroes throughout the nation, and as the founding administrative\nand educational leader of Tuskegee Institute in Alabama that continues\nto provide education to persons of African descent, Booker T.\nWashington\u2019s philosophizings, political engagements, and\npractical endeavors would have widespread, profound, and lasting\nimpact.\n\n\nWashington was challenged, publicly and on several fronts, by, among\nother thinker-activist Black persons, the astute and irrepressible\nthinker-scholar (and more) William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868\u20131963)\nwhose philosophical stances and strategies for transforming the\nconditions of existence for Black people were substantially\ndifferent from Washington\u2019s seeming public accommodation\nto White social hegemony. In the view of some, Washington might be\nbetter described as a social separatist and economic and political\nconservative committed to Black economic independence made even\nstronger by the predominance of Negroes in some sectors of the national\neconomy resulting in the dependence of White folks on the productivity\nof Black folks. To this end, for Washington and similar conservative\naccommodationists, the economic and political hegemony of White people\nwas to be finessed by strategies of seeming acceptance by\nBlack people that masked surreptitious opposition as Colored people\npursued economic self-reliance, full political citizenship, and\neventual social acceptance that was to be \u201cearned\u201d by\nforming and exercising good character and responsibility through\neducation for, and the practice of, honest, socially productive, and\neconomically rewarding work.\n\n\nDu Bois, however, argued for immediate recognition of and\nrespect for Negro people with full civil and political rights (though\nhe supported qualifications for exercising the franchise for\nall voters), social equality, and economic justice. He became\nan outspoken critic of Washington\u2019s leadership (\u201cOf Mr.\nBooker T. Washington and Others,\u201d 1903) having become impatient\nwith the latter\u2019s accommodating gradualism and the\nspirit-sapping impact he (Du Bois) thought this was having on those\nBlack folks who were ready, even overdue, for full equality and\nrespect (Du Bois 1903; 1992). In contrast to Washington, Du Bois might\nbest be described as a cultural nationalist\nadvocating pluralist integration: pursuit of a racially\nintegrated socially and politically democratic socio-political\norder\u2014and, later in his long life, a democratic socialist\neconomic order\u2014in which diverse racial and ethnic groups\ncultivate and share, and benefit mutually from sharing, the products\nof their cultural distinctiveness to the extent that doing so does not\nthreaten the integration and justness of the social whole.\n\n\nThe two men were from profoundly different backgrounds. Washington had\nbeen born into slavery, but with the aid of education and character\ndevelopment at Hampton Institute he was able to advance to national\nand international prominence as an educator and figure of\nunprecedented influence, which he recounted in his widely read and\ninspiring autobiography Up From Slavery (Washington 1901;\n1963). Du Bois, on the other hand, never had living experience with\nslavery, nor, even, with much in the way of invidious racial\ndiscrimination before entering college in the South. With\nundergraduate degrees from Fisk University and Harvard University,\nstudies at the University of Berlin, and a Ph.D. in History from\nHarvard, Du Bois was one of a very few exceptionally highly educated\npersons in the United States. Drawing on his learning and with\narrogant confidence in his education-enhanced, penetrating, creative,\nand critical intellect, varied, frequent, and penetrating scholarly\nand creative explorations of the history, conditions, and future\nprospects of the Negro and other oppressed races, as well as of\nWestern Civilization, became his passionate and committed life\u2019s\nwork.\n\n\nDu Bois far outstripped Washington in the range of his (Du Bois\u2019s) concerns, the\ndepths of his explorations, and the extent of his seminal involvements\nin and contributions to international organizations and movements\npressing for independence for colonized African and other peoples, his\ncontributions to a number of the international Pan-African Conferences\n(1919, 1921, 1923, 1927, and 1945) and Movement being but one example.\nAnd of particular note, Du Bois studied philosophy with William James\nand others while a student at Harvard, and, for a moment, considered\npursuing a career in the discipline. Though he chose otherwise, his\nvast and rich articulations are frequently philosophically novel and\nastute and thus all the more engaging for researchers, scholars,\nteachers, artists, and millions of readers in various educated publics.\nHis The Souls of Black Folk (1903), for example, has been a\nseminal text for generations of African Americans, and others, who were\ncoming of age intellectually. Many were aided, especially, by his\npoignant characterization and exploration of the vexing tensions of the\nexperience of \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d\u2014of the\n\u201ctwoness\u201d of being both Negro and American\u2014and by his\npromising exploration of how best to work at resolving the tension by\n\u2018merging\u2019 the two selves into one \u2018truer\u2019\nself.\n\n\nFrom Du Bois, then, a philosophy of the soul, if you will, motivated\nby the compelling needs of a racialized people subjected to\nontological as well as social, political, economic, and cultural\ndegradation. In particular, during the turbulent decades of the\norchestrated failure of post-Civil War Reconstruction, when real\npossibilities for racial and economic democracy were being killed at\nbirth by the proponents and guardians of capitalism and White Racial\nSupremacy, Du Bois initially worked out his affirmative cultural\nnationalist position on the raciality of the Negro, and of other\nraces, in \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d (1897; 1992). This\nwas an effort at conceptionalization to which Du Bois would return and\nrework several times, even near the end of his extraordinarily long\nand productive life, as in \u201cWhither Now and Why\u201d (1960;\n1973). Throughout his life Du Bois remained convinced that people of\nAfrican descent should articulate and appropriate a racial identity\nbased on shared history and culture and continue to invest in their\nhistorical legacies and cultural creativity while holding open to all,\n\u201con the principle of universal brotherhood,\u201d the\norganizations, institutions, and cultural riches in and through which\nthe life-worlds of Negro peoples are forged, sustained, and\nshared.\n\n\nBooker T. Washington died in 1915, W.E.B. Du Bois nearly half a\ncentury later (\u2026on the evening before the historic 1963 March on\nWashington for Jobs and Freedom as hundred of thousands of Negroes and\nother supporters converged on the nation\u2019s capital to press for\nfull civil and economic rights). The deaths of both brought to a close\ntheir long reigns of Black male leadership prominence, and\npredominance, in various arenas. Still, they were far from being the\nonly leaders of their people. For as the nineteenth century gave way to\nthe twentieth, Black women were again substantial contributors to the\nintellectual explorations, organizational work, and local, national,\nand international movements seeking freedom and enhanced existence for\nAfrican and African-descendant peoples. They were, as well, influential\non Black male leadership. In 1897, for example, Du Bois accepted an\ninvitation from Alexander Crummell to become a member of the American\nNegro Academy to share in the critical work of developing\nunderstandings of the deteriorating situation of Black people in the\nnation, made worse by widespread racially-motivated violence, in order\nto develop and implement strategies to protect and advance the race.\n(Du Bois offered his proposal in \u201cThe Conservation of\nRaces,\u201d the second Occasional Paper delivered to the group.) Due\nlargely to Crummell\u2019s objections, Black women were not initially\nallowed to become members of the Academy. However, while Crummell was a\nsubstantial influence on Du Bois, he (Du Bois) was also influenced by\nAna Julia Cooper who advised his thinking on a number of matters\nregarding which he conversed with his male colleagues in the Academy.\nOther women\u2014Ida B. Wells, Mary Church Terrell, Jane\nAdams\u2014also exerted critical influence on Du Bois through their\nideas, their organizational work, and their personal relations with\nhim.\n\n\nThese and other thoughtful, articulate, and engaged Black women did\nnot allow themselves to be limited to subordinate roles of influence on\nmale leaders. Rather, as was true for many of their foresisters, they\nhad important matters of concern about which they thought seriously,\ndiscussed in their women\u2019s clubs and other organizations, wrote\nand spoke, and worked with determination to effect progressive\ntransformations in the lives of women and their families as well as for\nthe racial group and the society as a whole. From the especially\nviolent and trying decades of Reconstruction on into the early decades\nof the twentieth century, women such as Wells-Barnett, Cooper, Terrell,\nand others contributed substantially to what has become a long and\nvaried tradition of woman-focused philosophizing and artistic\nexpression by women of African descent in the United States.\n\n\nContinuing the tradition, Elise Johnson McDougald, for example, wrote\nof \u201cThe Struggle of Negro Women for Sex and Race\nEmancipation\u201d (1924\u201325; 1995); Alice Dunbar-Nelson\n(1875\u20131935) of \u201cThe Negro Woman and the Ballot\u201d\n(1927; 1995); Sadie Tanner Mosell Alexander of \u201cNegro Women in\nOur Economic Life\u201d (1930; 1995); and Florence \u201cFlo\u201d\nKennedy produced \u201cA Comparative Study: Accentuating the\nSimilarities of the Societal Position of Women and Negroes\u201d\n(1946; 1995). Working through, and often leading, local, regional,\nnational, and international secular and church-related women\u2019s\nclubs and organizations, these and other Negro women gave defining\nshape to legacies of feminist and womanist engagement and leadership\nthat are now being reclaimed and studied for inspiration and\nguidance. And the efforts and contributions of several of these women\nwould be joined to those of later generations who would become major\ncontributors, in thought and in other ways, to developments that would\nunfold as history-making movements devoted to cultural expressiveness,\ngaining more in the way of civil and economic rights, to gaining\npower, Black Power!, and to gaining more freedom, rights, and\nrespect for women of all ethno-racial groups and socio-economic\nclasses.\n9. 1915\u20132000\n\n\nThe historical context for the subsequent and more recent\ndevelopments and movements was set by transformative dislocations and\nreconfigurations that intensified competitions within and among\nethno-racial groups and socio-economic classes that affected\nsignificantly relations between White and Black races, in particular,\nas the country went through unprecedented industrial and economic\ngrowth and increasing predominance in the Western hemisphere as a\nconsequence of the Great Depression (1929 through the late 1930s and\ninto the early 1940s) and attendant disruptions, recovery from which\nwas spurred significantly by involvements in the Second World War\n(1939\u20131945) and the Korean War (1950\u20131953). There followed several\ndecades of economic expansion and rising prosperity for urban,\nindustrial workers among whom were large numbers of Black workers,\ndescendants of earlier migrants to the urban centers, who benefitted\nfrom the industrial intensifications and thus expanded significantly\nthe growing modern, educated, increasingly economically viable,\nchurch-going, community-sustaining, psychologically secure and\nincreasingly self-confident aspiring Black working and middle classes\nthat were determined to provide successive generations with greater\nfreedom, respect, and economic security bolstered by high expectations\nfor even greater successes and achievements. Spread across both classes\nwere the tens of thousands of Black men who returned to civilian life\nfrom the country\u2019s recently racially integrated Armed Forces\nafter serving at home and overseas to help \u201cmake the world save\nfor democracy.\u201d A great many of these veterans, supported by\nNegro women and men who kept the home-front while enduring the\ndifficulties of wartime sacrifices as they worked the nation\u2019s\nfields and factories though still denied the fullness of citizenship,\nwere unwilling to acquiesce to the subordination to racial apartheid\nand invidious racial discrimination required by the doctrines and\nprograms of White Racial Supremacy that still held sway.\n\n\nThis context became the nurturing soil in which various forms of Black\nNationalism flowered once again as the influence of Washington\u2019s\nphilosophy and strategies declined. Caribbean-born immigrant Marcus\nGarvey (\u201cRace Assimilation,\u201d 1922; 1992; \u201cThe True\nSolution of the Negro Problem,\u201d 1922; 1992; \u201cAn Appeal to the\nConscience of the Black Race to See Itself,\u201d 1923; 1992), proponent of\na militant Black Nationalist philosophy of independence and\nself-reliance for Black peoples world-wide, and of the emigration of\npeople of African descent from the U.S. and elsewhere \u201cback to\nAfrica,\u201d rose to prominence from his base in New York City as\nthe most successful mass organizer of Black people in the history of\nthe U.S. with the founding and internationalization of his United\nNegro Improvement Association (UNIA) (Garvey 1925; 1986; Martin\n1986). Garvey\u2019s organizational and socio-political movement,\nfueled by his \u201cPhilosophy and Opinions\u201d carried by his\norganization\u2019s newspapers and other publications with\ninternational reach, along with the eruption of the Harlem\nRenaissance, likewise in New York, an eruption of literary and\nartistic productions motivated by very thoughtful and passionate\naffirmations of African ancestry and of the positive, creative\nimportance of the cultural and aesthetic significance of African\nAmerican life, were two of the most significant emigrationist and\ncultural nationalist developments of the period. Both were articulated\nthrough and otherwise spawned new, profoundly influential modes of\ncreative, reflective thought and expression.\n\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance was an extraordinary eruption of heightened,\ncritical, and creative self-conscious affirmative racial identification\nby thoughtful Negroes bent on expressing their affirmations of their\nraciality through all of the creative arts and modalities of\narticulation, a development unprecedented in the history of the\npresence of peoples of African descent in the United States (Huggins 2007). The\ncultural significance of the productions and articulations; of the\nengagements, practices, and creations of the bold and talented\nparticipant-contributors; of the organizations, institutions, and\npublications they created and endeavored to sustain (some successfully,\nmany others not) devoted to culture creation, refinement, preservation,\nand mediation\u2014 all continue to have substantial influences even\ntoday, most especially in terms of the novel ideas and idea-spaces and\ndiscursive communities that were created and articulated through the\nbodies of literature and works of art, music, and dance that are still\nbeing mined productively by contemporary artists and scholars. The\nproducers and carriers of the Renaissance were natives of the whole of\nthe African Diaspora, across the Atlantic World especially, as well as\nfrom across the African continent, and they drew on the cultural and\nhistorical legacies of both (and on those from other parts of the world)\nfor inspiration and content for their philosophizing artistic\ncreativity in defining and giving expression to The New\nNegro.\n\n\nAlain Leroy Locke (1886\u20131954), the first African American to\nearn a Ph.D. in Philosophy, from Harvard (having already earned a\ndegree from Oxford and having studied philosophy at the University of\nBerlin), and the first to be named a Rhodes Scholar, was one of the\nsignificant intellectual and facilitating midwives to the production\nand publication of much creative work during the Renaissance (as was\nDu Bois). As the guest editor for a special March 1925 issue\nof Survey Graphic devoted to explorations of race\nand the New York of people of African descent, Locke, titling the\nissue Harlem: Mecca of the New Negro, brought together for\nthe issue writings of fiction and poetry; articles on music, drama,\nthe Negro\u2019s past, \u201cNegro Pioneers,\u201d \u201cThe New\nScene,\u201d \u201cThe Negro and the American Tradition\u201d; and\nmuch else by a racially mixed large group of authors with expertise in\na wide variety of fields. Among these: Du Bois (\u201cThe Negro Mind\nReaches Out\u201d); Elise Johnson McDougald (\u201cThe Task of Negro\nWomanhood\u201d); pioneering Africanist anthropologist Melville J.\nHerskovits (\u201cThe Negro\u2019s Americanism\u201d); sociologist\nE. Franklin Frazier (\u201cDurham: Capital of the Black Middle\nClass\u201d); the young poet and creative writer Count\u00e9e\nCullen (\u201cHeritage\u201d); Howard University-based educator and\nscholar Kelly Miller (\u201cHoward: The National Negro\nUniversity\u201d); poetess Gwendolyn B. Bennett and creative writer\nLangston Hughes writing on music; poems by Angelina Grimke; and a\nlarge number of others. After the great success of the special issue,\nLocke edited and published an anthology, The New Negro, that\nincluded revised versions of most of the material from the Survey\nGraphic special issue, but with much new material and artwork by\nWinold Reiss, a very accomplished artist from Bavaria (Locke\n1925).\n\n\nIn the judgment of many scholars of the Renaissance, The New\nNegro became, in the words of one, \u201cvirtually the central\ntext of the Harlem Renaissance.\u201d The title was taken from the\ncollection\u2019s lead essay, \u201cThe New Negro,\u201d which was\nwritten by Locke. In the essay Locke endeavored to characterize the\n\u201cNew\u201d Negro, the circumstances of the emergence of this\ncharacter-type, the nature of its shared pride-of-race character, its\npsychology and mission and relation to the Negro masses, and the\nconsequences of the emergence of the New Negro for race relations in\nthe United States and for developments in Africa and the African\nDiaspora for which this new group-figure would serve as the avant\ngarde. The anthology, then, is a gateway to an important\nselection of articulations by figures who were seminal contributors to,\nas well as beneficiaries of, the Harlem Renaissance, and to the vast\nand still growing multidisciplinary body of works that explore various\naspects, figures, contributions, and consequences of the\nRenaissance. And Locke\u2019s lead essay is a poignant gateway into\nhis career of philosophizing as well as an adept example of an attempt\nto simultaneously characterize and give agenda-setting character and\nguidance to an extraordinary praxis-guiding artistic and intellectual\nrevolution the focal points of which were determined efforts of\nracial-group self-affirmation and self-determination, beginning with\nthe radical ontological work of redefining and revaluing on\nprogressive terms the meaning of the Negro, then setting the\ntasks by which the New Negro\u2014the \u201cthinking\nNegro,\u201d as Locke characterized the group in his\nessay\u2014would lead through decidedly Negro Africanist-inspired,\nphilosophically-minded cultural creativity and articulate expressions\nof philosophizings born of struggles\u2026\n\n\nAnd lead they did, as a number of the persons, organizations, and\ninstitutions participating in and contributing to the Renaissance, the\nGarvey and other movements, and others in the social classes that were\ninspired by and fed them all became prominent figures in the Civil\nRights/Freedom Movement of the 1950s-mid 1960s during which\n\u201ccivil rights\u201d and \u201cintegration\u201d were major\nobjectives of struggle. The National Association for the Advancement\nof Colored People (NAACP), the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense\nFund (which became formally independent from the NAACP in 1957), and\nthe National Urban League were but three of several organizations that\nwould lead the continuing, but substantially reenergized,\norganizationally strengthened, and philosophically prepared and focused\nstruggles to secure legally sanctioned and guaranteed democratic\nfreedom, social and political equality, economic justice, and human\ndignity for Negroes in the United States of America. Publications and\nstatements from these and other organizations; member correspondences;\nlegal briefs and papers from court cases; the creative and scholarly\nworks from members and descendants of the Renaissance, Garvey, and\nother movements; Black newspapers of the period\u2014all are rich\nrepositories of the philosophizings fueling and guiding the new phase\nof struggle.\n\n\nStudies of these philosophizings are likely to reveal that while\nthere definitely were persons and organizations advocating radical,\neven revolutionary, transformations of the political economy and social\norders of the United States, overwhelmingly the pursuit of\ndesegregation and racial integration as important manifestations of the\nachievement of democratic freedom, social and political equality,\neconomic justice, and human dignity for Negroes using moderate but\nprogressive strategies of legal and civil-disobedience struggles were\ndominant means and agendas of social and political effort exerted by\npeople of African descent in the United States over the last\nhalf-century and more. These commitments were manifested most\nprofoundly in the Civil Rights/Freedom Movement.\n\n\u201cThe Movement,\u201d as it was experienced and known by many\nof those intimately involved, proved to be a phenomenally\nhistoric, personally and socially transformative, national movement with\nprofound international ramifications in Africa\u2014South Africa\nespecially\u2014and other countries. Initially, the attack on racial\napartheid in the quest for racial integration was pursued through legal\nchallenges to de jure racial segregation. A major victory was\nachieved with the unanimous 1954 rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court in\nBrown v. Board of Education I and II that declared\nracial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, thereby\noverturning the Court\u2019s 1896 Plessey v. Ferguson\ndecision that declared that government-sanctioned racial segregation\nwas constitutional as long as \u201cseparate but equal\u201d\nresources and facilities were provided. The team of engaged and\ncreative Black (and White) legal warriors from the NAACP Legal Defense\nand Education Fund and other thinker-scholars (historians,\nsociologists, social psychologists) were successful in persuading the\nJustices on the Court that the invidious discrimination suffered by\nBlack folks within the schemes of White-dominated racial segregation\nwas manifested not only in decidedly unequal resources and facilities,\nbut, through \u201cinferior\u201d education in Negro schools, in\ndebilitating damage to the psychic souls and self-concepts of Negroes,\nthe children especially, which severely impaired their capacity to\ndevelop into and be the kind of persons who could meet the full\nresponsibilities and enjoy the full benefits of citizenship. In short,\nthe legal team forged a legal strategy that rested on the construction\nand successful articulation of a sophisticated philosophical\nanthropology, aided by empirical psychological, sociological, and\nhistorical studies, in support of an argument regarding the vital\nlinkage between the integrity of personhood and democratic citizenship,\nthus between the enabling of democratic citizenry and the education of\nthe person free of resource-impoverishment and the distortions of the\nsoul that were consequences of hierarchic, invidious racial\ndiscrimination that was being imposed on Negro children in racially\nsegregated schools. The Court was persuaded...\n\n\nHowever, this historic victory through persuasive philosophizing was\ninitially stymied by recalcitrant, segregationist local governments and\nan overwhelming majority of White citizens in the Confederate South and\nby much foot-dragging by local governments and White citizens in other\nregions of the country. White opponents of racial integration who were\ndetermined to preserve segregation and White Supremacy unleashed yet\nanother wave of violent terrorism. Nonetheless, the advocates of\ndesegregation and integration were determined to secure full rights and\nhuman dignity for Negro Americans. A new philosophy and strategy of\nstruggle was adopted that, through the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi,\nhad proven successful in defeating Great Britain as the colonial power\ndominating India: non-violent direct action in the pursuit of justice\ngrounded in an explicit philosophical commitment to the\nsanctity of human life, including love for opponents, and to\nthe redeeming and restorative powers, personally and socially, of\nprincipled commitment to engagement in nonviolent struggle.\n\n\nGandhi\u2019s philosophy, the history and intricacies of the\nmovement he led in India, and his leadership were studied closely by a\nyoung Negro missionary to India from the United States, James Morris\nLawson, Jr., who, due to his commitments to nonviolence, had already\nbeen imprisoned for refusing induction into the military during the\nKorean War. Noting from news accounts that reached him in India that\nthe Civil Rights/Freedom Movement in the United States was gathering force,\nLawson returned to the country determined to find ways to become\ninvolved and contribute. While studying theology at Oberlin College in\npreparation for a career as a minister in service to the Movement for\nsocial justice, he was introduced to Martin Luther King, Jr., who came\nto Oberlin to deliver a speech. Lawson was persuaded by King that he (Lawson)\nshould \u201cnot wait, come now\u201d to the South to aid the\nMovement by, among other things, providing instruction in the\nphilosophy of nonviolence. Lawson transferred to the Divinity School of\nVanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and was soon deeply\nengaged in providing intellectual and spiritual guidance and inspiration\nto the educational, psychological, philosophical, and practical\npreparation of legions of mostly young college students in the city who\nwere committed to engaging in nonviolent struggle to end the\nindignities suffered by Black people as a consequence of de\njure White Supremacy and racial segregation. The campaign they\nwaged, led by Fisk University co-ed Diane Nash and with the support of\nincreasing numbers of Nashville\u2019s Black citizens, White college\nstudents, and that of more than a few very principled and dedicated\nanti-segregation White citizens, was eventually successful in bringing\nabout the formal desegregation of the city\u2019s public facilities\nand commercial establishments. Many of the Nashville Movement\u2019s\nleaders and stalwart participants, Lawson included, would become major\ncontributors to the national Movement while other student-participants\nhelped to bring about further historic transformations in the city and\nelsewhere in the South, through their courageous participation in the\nFreedom Rides, especially. (A critical, full-length biography and\nphilosophical study of James M. Lawson, Jr. and his philosophical\ncommitments and engagements have yet to be undertaken and completed\u2026)\n\n\nA philosophy of nonviolence grounded in Christian love motivated and\nguided determined Black people, and allied White and other people, in\nachieving unprecedented progressive transformations of\ncenturies-hardened, intellectually well-supported social, political,\nand, to notable extents, economic life in a United States of America\nordered since its founding by philosophies of White Racial Supremacy\nand Black racial inferiority and subordination. Martin Luther King,\nJr.  (\u201cLove, Law, and Civil Disobedience,\u201d 1961;\n\u201cThe Ethical Demands for Integration,\u201d 1963) has become\nthe signature figure among several of the leaders of this Movement,\nmarked distinctively by his profoundly thoughtful Christian\ntheological and philosophical commitments to nonviolence as the\ngrounding for personal and shared social life as well as for engaging\nin struggles for freedom and justice (Washington, J.M. 1986). However,\nthe groundwork for the Movement he would be called to lead had been\nlaid and further developed by many other organizationally-supported\nNegro women and men of articulate thought and disciplined action from\nlabor and other constituencies: among these A. Philip Randolph (who\nserved as a founding organizer and president of the Brotherhood of\nSleeping Car Porters, president of the Negro American Labor Council,\nand vice president of the AFL-CIO) and Bayard Rustin (a veteran of\nstruggles for civil and other rights for Negroes and workers of all\ncolors), who were the organizers of the 1963 March on Washington for\nJobs and Freedom during which King delivered the speech (\u201cI Have\na Dream...\u201d) in which he invoked a vision for America that became\nhis hallmark and a guiding theme of the Movement.\n\n\nCertainly, Martin Luther King, Jr. is one of the most prolific and\nprofoundly influential, even historic, figures of African descent whose\narticulations continue to compel widespread, intensive study as\nespecially rich instances of religious, moral, theological, and\nsocio-political philosophizing. Still, King\u2019s articulations, as\nwell as the sacrificial life he lived and gave in leadership service,\nfirmly and uncompromisingly grounded in especially thoughtful\ncommitments to Gandhi-inspired nonviolence (\u201cNonviolence and\nRacial Justice,\u201d 1957; \u201cThe Power of Nonviolence,\u201d\n1958) and Jesus-inspired agape love (\u201cLove, Law, and\nCivil Disobediance,\u201d 1961; \u201cA Gift of Love,\u201d 1966)\nawait full and widespread appreciation as the truly phenomenal gifts of\ninspiration, commitment, and guidance to a social movement that they\nwere. They were gifts that, infused in and channeled by the Movement,\nchanged the legal and social structures, the culture of race relations,\nand thereby the history of the United States. These gifts also inspired\nothers in their struggles for similar changes elsewhere in the world.\nThe consequences of the Movement that embodied these gifts confirmed,\nonce again, that the combination of love and nonviolent struggle could,\nindeed, succeed. And, as has been the case throughout the history of\nthe presence of persons of African descent in this country, these\nparticular philosophical gifts were neither forged and developed in,\nnor mediated to others from, the contexts of academic Philosophy, but\nwere, indeed, philosophizings born of struggles, gifts that\nchanged a country for the better that, it is feared, has yet to\nrecognize and embrace fully the confirmed lessons the gifts\nembody\u2026\n\n\nOverwhelmingly, the pursuit of desegregation and racial integration\nas goals of movements for democratic freedom, social and political\nequality, economic justice, and human dignity for Negroes has been\na dominant item on the agendas of social and political philosophies\nmotivating and guiding struggles exerted by people of African descent\nin the United States over the last half-century and more, manifested\nmost profoundly in the Civil Rights/Freedom Movement. However, the\nMovement\u2019s integrationist agenda, moral-persuasionist strategies,\ncommitment to nonviolence, and explicit commitment to a theologically and\nreligiously grounded notion of love for the Movement\u2019s opponents\nwas strongly challenged by other organizational forces (mid-1960s to\nthe early 1970s), especially by \u201cYoung Turks\u201d in the\nMovement\u2019s Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), an\ninfluential number of whom were inspired by the revolutionary\nphilosophies conveyed in the speeches, writings, and organizational\nactivities of Malcolm X and the anti-colonial engagements and writings\nof Frantz Fanon as well as by major figures in decolonizing liberation\nmovements in Africa and elsewhere that were being waged through armed\nstruggle. These Young Turks, and others in a variety of decidedly\nLeft-Nationalist organizations and proto-movements who were inspired by\nvarious notions of revolutionary transformation, initiated yet another\nresurgence of Black Nationalist aspirations and movements that came to\nbe referred to collectively as the Black Power Movement. The period was\nalso complicated by competitive conflicts with a cacophony of persons\nand organizations espousing commitments to anti-Nationalist\nmulti-racial, multi-ethnic socialist and communist agendas.\n\n\nThis was a period of unprecedented tumult, complicated by violent\nrebellions by Black people in urban centers across the country, and by the\nnation\u2019s involvement in a gone-badly-wrong and increasingly\nunpopular war in Vietnam that was highlighted all the more by national and\ninternational movements against the War led principally by young,\ncollege-age people, many of whom had come of age politically through\ntheir involvements in or educative witnessing of the Civil Rights and\nBlack Power Movements. Of particular note, a significant number of\nyoung White women who had been intimately involved in the Civil Rights,\nBlack Power, and Anti-War Movements had become increasingly poignantly\naware of the disrespect for, misuse, and underutilization of women by\nmany men in the Movements and became radicalized into forging a\nmovement to address their concerns, which was subsequently\ncharacterized as the Second Wave Feminist Movement.\n\n\nAll of these developments were fueled by and fostered intense\nintellectual adventures, some of which were also fertilized by\npractical engagements of various kinds. The Black Power Movement, in\nparticular, overlapped with and both fueled and was fueled by\nphilosophizings and engagements that were definitive of more expansive\nand consequential Black Consciousness and Black Arts Movements that, as\nhad the Harlem Renaissance of several decades earlier, spurred an\nintensive and extensive renaissance of aggressively radical and\nexpressive creativity in the arts that was centered, once again, on\nreclaiming for self-definition and self-determination the ontological\nbeing of persons and peoples of African descent, with influences, in\nmany instances, from various Leftist ventures, nationalist and\ninternationalist as well as socialist and communist. This was an\nunstable and volatile mixture that cried out for a clarifying\nphilosophy to provide guidance through the thicket of ideological\npossibilities and the agendas for personal and communal\nidentity-formation and life-praxes that each proffered with greater or\nless coherence and veracity.\n\n\nMore than a few spokesmen and spokeswomen came forward to\nphilosophize on behalf of their group\u2019s or organization\u2019s\n(or their own) vision for \u2018what was to be done\u2019 to insure\nliberation for Black people, people of\nAfrican descent. (\u201cLiberation\u201d was the watchword\nfor the new agenda; \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201cColored\u201d were\ndenigrated and cast aside, no longer acceptable as terms of racial\nidentification). Politics\u2014and all aspects and dimensions of\nindividual and social life were explicitly politicized\u2014became\ndefined by and focused through the lenses of the substantive symbolics\nof racialized and enculturated Blackness, even as the\nintellectual warriors waging the conceptual and other battles on behalf\nof Blackness struggled to find adequate terms and strategies\nwith which to forge satisfactory and effective articulations of the\npassionately sought and urgently needed new identities as articulations\nof long standing identities and life-agendas were discredited and thus\nrendered inadequate for a significant and influential few. For still a\ngreat many other \u201cNegro?\u201d, \u201cBlack?\u201d,\n\u201cColored?\u201d, \u201cAfrican- American?\u201d,\n\u201cAfrican-descended?\u201d, and \u201cAmerican?\u201d persons there\nwas more than a bit of psychic turmoil and tension, no less of\nconsternation and confusion. And hardly any of these persons, nor even\nmany of the most ardent warriors calling for and/or purveying new\nnotions and definitions of \u201cBlack consciousness\u201d and\n\u201cBlack\u201d agendas for individual and shared lives, knew of\nand had recourse to Alain Locke\u2019s sober and sobering\nwell-reasoned \u201cThe New Negro,\u201d nor the rich resources that\nhad been created by the producers and carriers of the Harlem\nRenaissance. And so the intensified ontologizing philosophizing\nproceeded at near breakneck speed driven largely by a generation of\nyoung adults few of whom had, nor would accept, much in the way of\nintellectual or practical guidance from the experienced and wise of\nprevious generations for whom many of the young and arrogant had too little\nrespect\u2026\n\n\nThe reason, Harold Cruse, a wise and very experienced elder of Left\nand Nationalist organizations and struggles and a formidable thinker in\nhis own right, was careful to point out, was due to a severe and\nconsequential disruption of the passing-on of experience-tested and\nverified knowledge from one generation to another by the ravages of the\nwitch-hunting and persecuting of any and all accused of being a\nCommunist or Communist sympathizer during the crusading campaign led by\nSenator Joseph McCarthy during the 1950s. Many lives and careers were\ndestroyed as a result of McCarthy\u2019s campaign, and many persons\nand organizations with Leftist commitments were either destroyed or\ndriven underground, or otherwise left severely tainted and thus made an\n\u201cuntouchable\u201d bereft of employment, even for one-time\nfriends and close associates. (W.E.B. Du Bois was one who suffered this\nfate, which is largely why he made the momentous decision to renounce\nhis citizenship and leave the United States for residence in Ghana, where\nhe died\u2026) The radical Young Turks, then, not short of courage or\npassion, set out on a mission all but impoverished, in many cases, of\nmuch needed historical and intellectual capital, thus were sometimes poorly\narmed for the battles they sought to wage. Still, the\ntrans-generational disruption that Cruse pointed out was not complete.\nThere were those who filled the gap between the Harlem Renaissance and\nthe rise of the new Black renaissance who would be of\nsignificant influence and guidance, and would serve some in the new movements as personal as well as\nintellectual mentors and role models: Richard Wright, Robert Hayden, Ralph Ellison,\nMargaret Walker, Gwendolyn Brooks, Lorraine Hansberry, and James\nBaldwin, among several others.\n\n\nThere would be much philosophizing born of struggles by the\nnew generation. Much credit has to be given to those who had the\nwherewithal of discipline and fortitude, and good fortune, to survive\nand leave legacies of accomplishment that continue to enrich Black\nfolks, and others. The Black Arts Movement, for example, had profound\nimpacts through the productions and articulations that gave new\ndirections and meanings to artistic creativity, to the agendas guiding\ncreativity and expression and the mission of service to various\naudiences. A manifesto, \u201cTowards a Black Aesthetic,\u201d by\nHoyt Fuller (1923\u20131981; Fuller 1994) and his work as editor of\nthe journal Negro Digest, which later was renamed Black\nWorld and was followed by First World when the publisher\nof the latter was pressured to discontinue publication of a journal\nserving Black radicals, were path-setting ventures during a period\nmuch in need of clear paths. Likewise \u201cThe Black\nAesthetic\u201d by the essayist and theorist Addison Gayle,\nJr. (1932\u20131991), his introduction to an anthology that he edited\nand published bearing the same title (Gayle, Jr. 1972). A collection\nof writings on theory, drama, music, and fiction by many of the\nleading artistic minds in the new Black generation, The Black\nAesthetic has come to be regarded by scholars as \u201cthe\ntheoretical bible of the Black Arts Movement\u201d and thus did for\nthe makers of this Movement what Locke\u2019s The New Negro\nhad done for the makers of the Harlem Renaissance. Both Fuller and\nGayle would play roles similar to Locke\u2019s in serving as midwives\nto the creative and critically-minded development of a sizable portion\nof a generation of seriously radicalized Black\nthinkers-artists.\n\n\nThe new activist thinkers-artists of the 1960s\u2014Nikki Giovanni,\nSonia Sanchez, Amiri Baraka, A.B. Spellman, Larry Neal, Mari Evans,\nHaki R. Madhubuti, and Maulana Karenga, for example\u2014were as\nproductive, formidable, and widely influential as were the New\nNegroes of the 1920s and 1930s, even more so as they exploited the\nadvantages of access to the enabling resources of the media of radio,\ntelevision, and recordings in addition to print media, and to the human\nresources that became available through lecture-circuits on college and\nuniversity campuses. Many of these Black warriors of the intellect and\narts took up positions, some settling into them for the long term, on\nthe faculties of colleges and universities and helped to development\nthe guiding philosophies and wage the political battles that ushered in\nnew programs in Black and African Studies. In so doing they magnified\nthe forcefulness and range of their intellectual and artistic powers\nand contributions, and helped to alter cultural and intellectual scenes\nin the United States and the African Disapora\u2026\n10. 1950\u2013Present: Professional Philosophers of African Descent\n\n\nUntil quite recently, there were very few person of African descent\nwho were professionals in the discipline of Philosophy. As already noted, W.E.B. Du\nBois was one of a very few to study Philosophy formally while a student\nat Harvard but decided against pursuing it professionally. Alain Leroy\nLocke was one of the first persons of African descent in America to\nearn a doctoral degree in Philosophy (Harvard University, 1918). A few\nmore followed decades later (1950s), among them Broadus N. Butler, Max\nWilson, Berkeley Eddins, and, still later, Joyce Mitchell Cook, the\nfirst African American female to earn a Ph. D. in Philosophy. These\nwere some of the pioneering persons of African descent in the United\nStates who entered the profession of academic Philosophy with the\ncertification of a terminal degree in the discipline.\n\n\nMore recently (late 1960s through the 1970s) successive generations of\npersons of African descent have entered the profession as cohorts of\nnew generations of young Black women and men entered the academy with\nthe expansion of opportunities for higher education that came as a\nresult of the successes of the desegregation-integration and Civil\nRights Movements. More than a few of these persons were influenced by\nthe Black Power, Black Consciousness, and Black Arts Movements, as\nwell, and in some cases by independence and decolonization movements\non the African continent and in the African Diaspora in the\nCaribbean. The emergence of and pursuit of distinctive agendas within\nacademic Philosophy to articulate and study philosophizings by persons\nAfrican and of African descent were initiated by several of the new\nentrants, agendas that grew out of and were motivated by these\nmovements. Thus, the new entrants were determined to contribute as\neducators, sometimes as engaged intellectuals involved in movement\norganizations, by identifying and contributing to, or by helping to\nforge anew, philosophical traditions, literatures, and practices\nintended, in many instances, to be distinctive of the thought- and\nlife-agendas of Black peoples. Here, then, the wellspring of concerns\nand aspirations that gave rise to calls for, and efforts to set out,\n\u201cBlack\u201d philosophy, then \u201cAfro-American,\u201d and\nlater \u201cAfrican American\u201d philosophy, precursive efforts\nleading to what is now the more or less settled name, but\nstill developing concept, of\nAfricana philosophy.\n\n\nFormal, professional recognition and sanctioning of these efforts,\nwhich had been pursued, with significant impact, through presentations\nof papers on and discussions of various topics in sessions during\nannual meetings of divisions of the American Philosophical Association\n(APA) and other organizations of professional philosophers and other organizations of\nteacher-scholars such as the Radical Philosophers Association (RPA) and\nthe Society for Phenomenological and Existential Philosophy (SPEP),\nwere achieved when, in 1987, the APA recognized the efforts as\nhaving established a legitimate sub-field of Philosophy and made\n\u201cAfricana philosophy\u201d an officially listed specialty in the\ndiscipline. Across the years, the APA\u2019s Committee on\nBlacks in Philosophy has been instrumental in organizing a number of\nthese important sessions, though, of no less importance, many such\nsessions were hosted by other sympathetic and supportive committees of\nthe APA as well as by other organizations of professional\nphilosophers that held meetings concurrent with those of divisions of\nthe Association. Thus, the recognition and sanction have come, to\nsignificant degrees, as results of long efforts led by philosophers\nRobert C. Williams (deceased), William Jones, Howard McGary, Jr., and\nLa Verne Shelton, among others, each of whom gave years of service as\nchairpersons of the APA\u2019s Committee on Blacks in\nPhilosophy. Each also contributed early articulations that initiated\nthe work of forging the sub-field.\n\n\nAlso of special importance to this long development towards\nrecognition and legitimation, and to the production of much of the\nearly writings, presentations, and critical networking collegiality\nthat have been foundational to the development of Africana philosophy,\nwere a series of conferences devoted to explorations of \u201cBlack\nPhilosophy\u201d or of \u201cPhilosophy and the Black\nExperience\u201d that were held during the 1970s, most of them\norganized and hosted at Historically Black Colleges and Universities\n(HCBUs: notably, Tuskegee University, Morgan State University, and\nHoward University) though important gatherings were also held at the\nUniversity of Illinois-Chicago Circle (ca 1970, another thirty\nyears later), Haverford College (an international gathering in the\nsummer of 1982 of African and African American philosophers and\nteacher-scholars from other disciplines), and, more recently, at the\nUniversity of Memphis. Particularly noteworthy in this regard is the\nPhilosophy Born of Struggle Conference, which has been hosted annually\nfor fifteen years primarily through the indefatigable efforts of J.\nEveret Green and Leonard Harris, and the Alain Locke Conference\norganized and hosted biannually by the Department of Philosophy of\nHoward University (Washington, DC).\n\n\nThe development and institutionalization of African American\nphilosophy, of Africana philosophy more generally, with recognition by\nthe American Philosophical Association\u2014though not by all, or\neven most, departments of Philosophy in academic\ninstitutions\u2014have also been facilitated by the noteworthy\nsuccess of many of the pioneers in securing and retaining positions in\nacademic departments (of Philosophy, of Philosophy and Religion, of\nPhilosophy and other disciplines) in various institutions of higher\neducation across the country. A substantial few of these persons have\nearned tenure and promotions, several to the rank of Professor, while\nseveral have even been appointed to endowed\nprofessorships. Consequently, a slowly increasing number of\nphilosophers who are African or of African descent now hold positions\nin departments and programs that serve graduate and professional\nstudents. Of importance, then, have been the growing number of\nlectures and seminars in colleges and universities across the country\ngiven and directed by philosophers of African descent in response to\ninvitations, and as part of regular curricular offerings,\nrespectively, of departments of Philosophy, often with the cooperation\nand co-sponsorship of other departments and programs. These invited\npresentations and regularized curricular offerings reconfirm and\nstrengthen the intellectual legitimacy of much work in Africana\nphilosophy while doing much the same for the invited and teaching\nphilosophers.\n\n\nOne especially significant consequence of these important developments\nis that several of these persons now have built legacies of teaching\nand scholarship that span decades with significant influences on\ngenerations of students. Practitioners of Africana philosophy are even\nproducing new generations of practitioners. And practitioners of all\ngenerations are contributing to the literature of articulate\nexpression of what is now a substantial and growing body of works\nsupporting teaching, research, and scholarship in Africana philosophy\nwhile, in the process of doing so, also initiating, and otherwise\ncontributing to, substantial changes to discursive agendas. Certainly,\nthe example beyond debate continues to be critical explorations\nof race and of \u201cracism,\u201d matters that have\ndistorted the basic institutions, virtually all considerations and\npractices, and all lives across the entirety of the history of the\nUnited States of America, and that of much of the world. However, it\nwas not until philosophers of African descent focused their\nphilosophizing on critical engagements with the racial conditionings\nof the profession and of life generally that discussions, teaching,\nand scholarship within professional Philosophy were opened to and\nconditioned by new critical discursive agendas affecting numerous\nsubfields within the discipline and the organization of the\nprofession, evident in the surge of writings by philosophers African\nand of African descent published in mainstream journals and by\nmainstream publishers.\n\nRace Matters by Cornel West (1994) became the national and\ninternational best-seller that propelled West into prominence as an\nacademic philosopher and preacher-become-public intellectual who\ncontributed to reinvigorated public critiques of racism with\nprofessionally attuned philosophical acumen. Yet, his earlier\npublication Prophesy Deliverance! An Afro-American Revolutionary\nChristianity (1982) had even greater impacts on discourses within\nthe academic disciplines of Philosophy, Theology, and\nReligion/Religious Studies, in particular. Of especially notable\ninfluence were his genealogy of racism and his sketching out of four\ndistinctive traditions of responsive thought generated by Black\nthinkers. West\u2019s genealogical critique drew on several canonical\nfigures (Nietzsche, Michel Foucault) and was thus emblematic of his\nexpansive learnedness and creative ingenuity in drawing on canonical\nfigures to redirect critical thought back upon the social orders and\nhistory-making practices of those subjecting folks of African descent,\nand others, to dehumanization.\n\n\nOthers contributing to and shaping such critiques include Howard\nMcGary, whose Race and Social Justice (1999) brought together\na number of seminal essays in which he explored moral and political\nquestions regarding race and racism in a new and distinctive (and\ndistinctively embodied) voice among practitioners of Analytic\nPhilosophy, a voice concerned with social justice, with issues of\nequity and inclusion especially, while drawing on and highlighting\nlived experiences of African Americans conditioned unjustly and\nimmorally. For McGary, philosophical work was no longer to be confined\nto analysis restricted to \u2018getting the terms\nright\u2019. Rather, having lived experiences of invidious racial\ndiscrimination and impediments to accessing and exploiting conditions\nof possibility by which Black persons might forge individual and\ngroup-shared flourishing lives, across generations, McGary has\nremained committed to disciplined, well-argued clarifications and\nrevisions of key notions by which to pursue and secure social justice,\nmost especially for those \u201cleast well off\u201d: the\nBlack underclass.\n\n\nContinuing such efforts, in a different register, with substantial and\ninnovative contributions is Paul Taylor (who studied with McGary at\nRutgers University). His Race: A Philosophical Introduction\nstands out as an especially clearly-articulated, nuanced, clarifying\nnavigation of many of the complexities of conceptualizations\nof race firmly situated in reconstructions of historical\npractices guided by political and other agendas. Yet, it is\nTaylor\u2019s Black is Beautiful: A Philosophy of Black\nAesthetics that is especially noteworthy. It is, perhaps, the\nfirst-in-decades book-length \u201cassembling\u201d (Taylor\u2019s\nown characterization of his effort) of a\ndeliberately philosophical theory of Black aesthetics: that\nis, a critical theoretical exploration of the roles expressive\npractices and objects play when taken up by Black folks in the\ncreation and maintenance of their lifeworlds. (The philosopher Alain\nLeroy Locke, midwife to the New Negroes of the Harlem Renaissance,\npreceded Taylor by half-a-century in taking seriously Black expressive\nlife, as did W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, James\nBaldwin, Toni Morrison, and numerous others.) Taylor\u2019s efforts\nare doubly innovative in his endeavor to bridge two discursive\ncommunities heretofore not in communication: professional\nphilosophers, and others, concerned with aesthetics who have had\nlittle to no concern with aesthetics in Black life; Black artists and\ncritics fully immersed in the productions of and engagements with\nexpressive practices and objects in Black life with little to no\nengagements with resources drawn from academic, professional\nPhilosophy. As did Alain Locke, Taylor aims to contribute to a new\ngeneration of articulate thinkers who are focusing their critical\nacumen on the expressivity and performativity in productions of self,\nand of self in relations with others, of those who have been\nracialized as Black.\n\n\nBut, how have folks African and of African descent been figured in the\nexpressive practices and products, and in the theorizings of such\naesthetic ventures, produced, in both cases, by folks not Black?\nRobert Gooding-Williams is but one of several philosophers of African\ndescent who probes these questions in his Look, A Negro!\nPhilosophical Essays on Race, Culture and Politics (2006), a\ncollection of essays connected, he notes, by his persistent effort to\nexplore whether it is possible to interpret race in ways that\nwould be in keeping with what is required in political and cultural\nlife if the United States as a polity were to become actually\nstructured by democratic principles and practices while adult citizens\nfully acknowledge the history and continuing legacies of White racial\nsupremacy that have structured the polity from its inception. In the\nchapter on \u201cAesthetics and Receptivity: Kant, Nietzsche, Cavell,\nand Astaire,\u201d for example, Gooding-Williams rehearses accounts\nof aesthetic experiences by the canonic figures Kant (re:\n\u201caesthetic judgment\u201d) and Nietzsche (re: embodied\nsensibilities) in preparation for a critical reading and assessment of\nthe philosopher Stanley Cavell\u2019s aesthetic reading of how the\ndancer Fred Astaire is rendered in a particular movie in which he\nstars (The Band Wagon) as the focal character who is\nable/enabled to reclaim himself (i.e., make a \u201ccomeback\u201d)\nas a star dancer. What Gooding-Williams lifts up is Cavell\u2019s\nfailure to see that the Astaire-character is enabled by a\nBlack male character who, in shining Astaire\u2019s shoes, transfers\nto Astaire and his feet a restoration of rhythmic capabilities by way\nof the rhythms the Black shoeshine-man articulates while brushing the\nAstaire-character\u2019s shoes and polishing them with his\nshine-rag. All of which presumes something (on the part of the\nfilm-maker; so, too, Cavell, though differently...) about the\nembodiment of enabling aesthetic capabilities of particular kinds in\nthe being of the Black character representative of the\nculturally-inflected raciality of Black people.\n\n\nThere are centuries-long, quite rich traditions of thought\narticulated, and political praxis engaged in, by Black folks for whom\nit is the case that the constitutive racially of Black folks is such\nthat it sets the terms not only of identity, but, as well, of the\nethical imperatives of intra- and interracial mutualities, that is, of\nvarious modes and instances of solidarity. And, as well, for\ncompelling pragmatic reasons: to contend with, ultimately to overcome,\ninvidious racial discrimination and oppression. No small matters for\npersons and peoples suffering racialized dehumanization and\nexploitation thus in need of shared motivating and guiding notions of\nhow to gain and sustain freedom and justice. Many concerned to forge\nfreedom in just conditions have sought morally compelling guiding\nunderstandings in shared raciality, in being, by particular\nunderstandings of raciality, a distinctive people, a\ndistinctive nation of Black people. Hence, traditions of\n\u201cBlack Nationalism,\u201d waxing and waning across the\ncenturies, resurgent more recently in various forms (music and art;\n\u201cAfrocentric\u201d thought) and locales in the United States,\nin particular. Tommie Shelby, who became a certified professional\nphilosopher after the resurgent Black nationalisms of the Black Power\nand Black Arts movements, while deeply committed to philosophical\nengagements with and out of contexts of lived experiences of Black\nfolks in which much of his life has been conditioned, has, in\nhis We Who Are Dark: The Philosophical Foundations of Black\nSolidarity, endeavored to work out a philosophically clarified\nand justified account of the terms and agenda of solidarity as a basis\nfor organized and coordinated struggles for justice. The account is\nintended to be both motivating and welcoming of the solidaristic\ncooperation of persons Black and non-Black without needing to resort\nto what he reasons to be the philosophically indefensible racial\nessentialism of various construals of Black nationalism. Yet, the\naccount is intended to be in keeping with important conceptual and\nnormative groundings of Black political cultural life that are, as\nwell, compatible with a notion of political liberalism worked out by\nJohn Rawls. With Shelby\u2019s efforts, too, there is the hard work\nof extending decidedly prominent mainstream philosophical thought\n(that of of Rawls in this particular case) to a creatively critical\nengagement with unjust limiting conditions on the lives of Black folks\nin conjunction with efforts of philosophical reconstruction and\ndefense of principles of Black solidarity that embrace a notion\nof Blackness suitable for emancipatory work.\n11. Publishing and Professional Africana Philosophy\n\n\nLeonard Harris has been a pioneer of published works on African\nAmerican philosophy and continues to be a major contributor in many\nways, not least as an editor of collections that have made widely\navailable important texts that otherwise would not have gotten the\nattention of researchers and scholars concerned with the\nphilosophizings of Black folks. Of particular note, his edited\ncollection The Philosophy of Alain Locke: Harlem Renaissance and\nBeyond (Harris 1989) provides ready access to philosophical\nessays from among Locke\u2019s more than three hundred published and\nunpublished essays and book reviews. And his\nPhilosophy Born of Struggle: Anthology of Afro-American Philosophy\nfrom 1917 (Harris 1983) was for many years the only widely\navailable, somewhat historically organized collection of writings by\nAfrican American professional philosophers and other philosophizing\nBlack scholars. (An important earlier collection is Percy\nE. Johnston\u2019s Afro-American Philosophers. (Johnston\n1970)) More recently new collections devoted to African American\nPhilosophy have been organized and published by Tommy L. Lott (Lott\n2002); by Lott and John P. Pittman (Lott and Pittman 2003); and by\nJames A. Montmarquet and William H. Hardy (Montmarquet and Hardy\n2000).\n\n\nThis publishing is an important part of the story of Africana\nphilosophy, and helps to make and legitimate the case that persons\nAfrican and of African-descent, on the African continent and in the\nAfrican Diaspora in the Americas and elsewhere, are creators and\ncustodians of Africana philosophy. A number of publishers have\nrecognized and accepted these developments and, after substantial,\nlong-standing resistance and outright refusal by many to recognize\nhistoric writings by persons of African descent and contemporary\nscholarship by philosophers African and of African descent as proper\ninstances of philosophical work, have made a priority of adding works\nof Africana philosophy to their lists of published works.\n\n\nOf particular publishing significance is the continuing, regular\nappearance of issues of Philosophia Africana: Analysis of\nPhilosophy and Issues in Africa and the Black Diaspora, a journal\nfor which Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze of DePaul University was founding\neditor until his unexpected death in 2007. Philosophia\nAfricana remains the only scholarly journal in the United States\nthat is devoted to Africana philosophy, though increasingly other\nphilosophy journals are accepting and publishing writings that fall\nwithin the subfield. None, however, have been as generous as\nPhilosophical Forum, which, under the editorial directorship\nof Max Wartofsky (deceased), devoted two entire special issues to\nexplorations of philosophical matters of particular concern to Black\nphilosophers. Noteworthy, too, has been the continuing midwifing of New\nYork-based publisher and scholar Alfred Prettyman, who has devoted\ntime, energy, and other resources to nurturing The Society for the\nStudy of Africana philosophy (originally the New York Society for the\nStudy of Black Philosophy), an organization of philosophers and other\nengaged thinkers of African descent, and persons not of African\ndescent, who come together in his home to present and discuss ideas and\nworks on the way to publication or recently published. For a brief\nperiod Prettyman was editor and publisher of the now dormant The\nJournal of the New York Society for the Study of Black\nPhilosophy.\n\n\nThe professional recognition and legitimation of Africana philosophy\ngenerally, of African, African American, and Afro-Caribbean philosophy\nas sub-foci of the field; the notable success enjoyed by a slowly\nincreasing number of persons African and of African descent in being\nhired, retained, and promoted by departments and programs in\ninstitutions of higher education; more publishing opportunities; a\ncontinuing vigorous schedule of regular conferences and conference\nsessions devoted to explorations of matters pertinent to the\nfield\u2014all of these continue to be crucial to building and\nenhancing the literature-base of the field and to facilitating\nteaching, research, scholarship, and other collegial engagements and\npractices that are essential to forming and sustaining nurturing\ndiscursive communities devoted to engaging philosophizing productive of\nAfricana philosophy. And the enterprise is being enriched by the\nparticipation and contributions of an increasing number of persons,\nstudents and professionals, who are neither African nor of African\ndescent.\n12. Africana Philosophy: Contributions\n\n\nSubstantial progress has thus been made in mitigating some of the\nimpediments that had long hampered recognition of and attending to the\nphilosophizing efforts of persons African and of African descent.\nNonetheless, still more mitigating work remains. There is the need, for\nexample, to bring to consideration for better appreciation the writings\nof several generations of especially thoughtful and insightful Black\nessayists and novelists, poets and musicians, artists and dancers,\npreachers and theologians, and other public-speaking Black\nintellectuals who, through their means of expression, have\nphilosophized about the conditions and prospects of Black folks and, in\nmany cases, have helped to sustain the will and determination to\nendure the assaults on the humanity, on the being, of\npersons and peoples African and of African descent. In this regard, too\nlittle attention has been given, for example, to the philosophical\nwriter-novelist Charles Johnson who, before he became a distinguished\nnovelist, was a graduate student in Philosophy. The articulated thought\nof many other Black writers, some of them novelists, also compel close,\nappreciative readings by philosophers for what these articulations\ndisclose of the writers coming to terms thoughtfully and creatively\nwith the exigencies of existence for Black folks as the writers\nimagined or re-imagined them in the locales and historical moments of\ntheir writerly creations. Likewise in many sermons, speeches, letters,\nsongs, and dances created and expressed, creatively very often, by\nthoughtful Black persons. Of necessity, then, Africana\nphilosophy must be an even more intensive and extensive\ninterdisciplinary enterprise.\n\n\nA principal impediment to the recognition and appreciation of the\nphilosophizings of Black folks have been the thorough investments in\nEurocentrism and White Racial Supremacy that have grounded and\nstructured so much of the historiography within the discipline of\nPhilosophy for so very many decades. Resolving these misconstruals of\nthe discipline\u2019s history will require substantial revisions,\nones inclusive of the philosophizings of persons of many excluded\ngroupings.  In so doing, careful work must be done to reclaim for\nwider distribution and careful study as many as possible of the\nearliest articulations\u2014many of which were never\npublished\u2014that helped pave the way to the development of African\nAmerican philosophy, of Africana philosophy more generally, as fields\nof discourse (Kuklick 2001; Kuklick 2008).\n\n\nWith hindsight, an especially crippling factor in the development of\nAfricana philosophy within academic Philosophy in the United States\n(throughout the African continent and the African Diaspora, in fact)\nhas been that far too little of the attention of the pioneers, and of\npresent practitioners, has been devoted to issues that are of\nsignificance to women African and of African descent even though, as\nhas been indicated through the narration of the history of\nphilosophizing born of struggles, the contributions of Black\nwomen have been significant though seldom with the prominence of\nattention they should have had outside of women\u2019s circles. As\nwas shown, in the New Worlds in which African peoples were being\nre-made/were remaking themselves into new persons and peoples of\nAfrican descent, numerous Black women across the generations were\nchallenged to think hard and long about the assaults on their\ncommunities, their families, their very bodies and souls. Here, then,\na compelling need to foster and support the philosophizing\nefforts of Black women who direct our attention to the lives and\nphilosophizing of Black women, historically and\ncontemporarily. Noteworthy in this regard are the groundbreaking,\ninspiring efforts of philosopher Kathryn Gines in founding the\nCollegium of Black Women Philosophers. The Collegium is bringing\ntogether women from across the country in conferences devoted to\nrecovering and recognizing the contributions of pioneering women\nphilosophers of African descent while exploring present issues and\nforging agendas of further work to be done.\n13. Future Developments\n\n\nThe possible futures of developments in Africana philosophy in\nAfrican and the African Diaspora are open. The initial work of making\nthe case for and legitimacy of African American, African, and Africana\nphilosophy and its subfields has been accomplished with significant\nsuccess even without universal acceptance and respect. That is to be\nexpected, for no intellectual movement or disciplinary sub-field ever\nwins acceptance by all. Still, there is more to be done by way of\nconsolidating the gains while forging new developments as minds are\nturned to challenging issues, many of them novel. To note, for two\ndecades much of the effort of practitioners of Africana philosophy has\nbeen devoted to explorations of race, a foundational and\npervasive complex of forceful factors shaping virtually all aspects and\ndimensions of life in the formation of Modernity in Europe and the\nAmericas, and in every instance in which Europeans encroached on the\nlands and lives of peoples around the globe. Achieving justice without\nracism in polities bequeathed by Modernity is hardly finished business.\nSo, the need to rethink race will be with us for a while\nyet.\n\n\nHowever, the need will be generated by resolutions of old\ndifficulties and challenges. Success will bring new challenges. Among\nthese, settling such questions as whether there can and should be\nnorms, practices, and agendas that are definitive of philosophizing\nidentified as instances of \u201cAfricana\u201d philosophy. If so,\nthen on what terms, and to what ends, are the requisite agendas, norms,\nand practices to be set to serve the best interests of African and\nAfrican-descended peoples, without injustice to non-Black peoples, and\nthereby provide those philosophizing with normative guidance while\nconforming to norms that ensure propriety and truthfulness in\ndiscursive practices on conditions of warrant that are open to and can\nbe confirmed by persons who are neither African nor African-descended?\nShould such concerns continue to be appropriate conditioners of\nphilosophical effort? The praxes and supportive discursive communities\nconstitutive of Africana philosophy will have to meet certain\ninstitutionalized rules governing scholarly practices even as those of\nus committed to the development of the enterprise contribute to\ncritiques and refinements of these institutionalized rules while\ndevising and proposing others.\n\n\nThe work constituting Africana philosophy, on the African continent\nand throughout the African Diaspora, has helped to change the agendas\nand rules of discourse and praxis in Philosophy and other disciplines\nand discursive communities in contemporary academic institutions and\norganizations. The enterprise has been a significant contributor to the\nemergent recognition of the need to give greater respectful attention\nto raciality and ethnicity (as well as to gender, sexual orientation,\nand other constitutive aspects of our personal and social identities)\nas conditioners of philosophical praxis without thereby invalidating\nreconstructed notions of proper reasoning. As well, practitioners of\nAfricana philosophy have aided the development of much wider and deeper\nrecognition and acknowledgment of inadequacies in basic notions and\nagendas in the legacies of Western Philosophy thereby helping to open\nus all to challenging new needs and possibilities for further revising\nphilosophical traditions and practices. The expansion of academic\nPhilosophy to include Africana philosophy is indicative of efforts to\nachieve greater intellectual democracy in multi-ethnic, multi-racial\nsocieties. These developments should be continued, aided by\nphilosophizing persons who are neither African nor of African descent,\nnor, even, professional academic philosophers, and continued as part of\na larger, ongoing effort to appreciate and learn from the many\nlife-enriching creations of all peoples as contributions to\nthe treasure-houses of human civilization.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Africana Philosophy", "African Philosophy", "African American Philosophy", "Afro-Caribbean Philosophy"], "cat_ref_text": {"Africana Philosophy": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Gordon, L, 2008, <em>An Introduction to"], "African Philosophy": ["</em>,\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Monahan, M.
