    "main_text": "Political legitimacy and Public Health || Normative Disagreement and Legitimacy\n3.3 Normative Disagreement and Legitimacy\n\nA small but growing literature addressing concerns about legitimacy\naccepts a broadly liberal view of political morality but emphasizes a\nslightly different set of concerns. More specifically, some argue that\nthe distinctive problems of public health ethics do not merely extend\nto offering answers to moral questions about, say, whether the state\nis permitted to try to reduce the incidence of obesity or whether such\na policy is just. Instead, the public health ethicist also faces moral\nquestions about the normatively appropriate ways for governments to\nrespond to disagreements among its citizen about how to distribute\nresources or what considerations (if any) justify attempts to reduce\nthe incidence of obesity. That is, given the plurality of views about\nthe good life or justice, how should we ultimately arrive at\nparticular policies designed to promote public health? (Kristine\nB\u00e6r\u00f8e et al. 2014; Anomaly 2011; Coggon 2012; Daniels and\nSabin 1997; Daniels and Sabin 2008; Bonotti 2014; Bonotti and Barnhill\n2019)\n\nConsider, for example, a municipal tax on sugar-sweetened beverages.\nPublic health authorities and policymakers may defend the tax by\npointing to the health burdens of rising obesity rates, which are\nfueled by the consumption of sugary beverages that have no redeeming\nnutritional value. Not everyone in the population affected by the tax\nshares the values that underlie this position, however. Some citizens\nreject the view that overweight bodies are somehow objectionable and\ninstead see them as something else entirely \u2013 large or\ntraditionally built bodies that are particularly attractive and\nbeautiful. Other citizens greatly enjoy the pleasures associated with\nsweets, including sweetened beverages. These citizens might object\nthat they value sweets or having a beautiful body so much that they\nare more than willing to assume any associated elevated risk of, say,\nhypertension or diabetes. Here, there is genuine disagreement within\nthe affected population about standards of beauty, the worth of sweet\ndrinks, and how important these values are compared to health. (Other\ndisagreements concern what conception of health we should accept.) If\nthe soda tax is implemented in the name of promoting population\nhealth, then a distinctive issue arises: the justification for the\nsoda tax appeals to a conception of what is overall valuable or good\nthat not all citizens accept. Disagreements about values also plague\npublic health concerns about justice. As we have already noted, there\nare competing theories about why health matters, morally, as well as\nwhether health policy should aim to maximize overall population health\nor reducing unjust inequalities in health status or health care\naccess. In the face of these kinds of disagreements about the good\nlife or justice, what makes public health policies legitimate?\n3.3.1 Public Reason Liberalism\n\nOne line of response to normative disagreement draws on work in\npolitical philosophy that develops theories of public reason or public\njustification (see the\n entry on public reason,\n and the entry on\n public justification).\n According to public reason theorizing, political power is legitimate\nif and only if it is exercised in accordance with shared political\nvalues or normative reasons that idealized members of a political\ncommunity can accept, would accept, could not reject, or would not\nreject. To return to the earlier example, imagine that when defending\na soda tax to citizens, some legislators point to passages in their\npreferred religious texts to support the tax. Other supporters claim\nthat smaller bodies are more beautiful than larger ones, and so we\nshould try to reduce the incidence of obesity. Neither of these\nconsiderations would count as public reasons because reasonable\ncitizens have different aesthetic standards and disagree about which\n(if any) religious texts are authoritative. According to public reason\nliberalism, to justify a policy on the basis of these sorts of reasons\nwhen some (idealized) citizens could not or would not accept those\nreasons would be to run afoul of a requirement of legitimacy.\n\nPublic justification theorists also offer competing explanations as to\nwhy political officials ought only to exercise political power on the\nbasis of values that satisfy requirements of public justification. For\ninstance, some argue that if policies are coercively enforced on the\nbasis of reasons that at least some citizens cannot accept, then we\nfail to accord them the respect to which they are entitled. Others\nfocus less on coercion but nonetheless insist that considerations of\nreciprocity or community generate requirements of public reason. (For\na variety of views about the normative significance of satisfying\nrequirements of public reason, see esp., Quong 2011; Rawls 1993; Gaus\n2010; the entry on\n public reason;\n and the\n entry on public justification.)\n\nRegardless of the preferred rationale, if one accepts the claim that\npolicies are legitimate only if they are justifiable on the basis of\npublic reasons, a great deal turns on how one specifies public\nreasons. And such specifications have significant implications for the\nscope of the mandate of public health. Some argue that public reasons\ninclude reasons that are acceptable given shared epistemic standards\nor values internal to a political culture, or a society\u2019s shared\nconception of justice. Shared conceptions of justice or values in a\npolitical culture are presumably consonant with a broad array of\npublic health interventions. For instance, imagine someone justifying\nvarious programs that would provide access to healthier foods. This\nperson could invoke shared epistemic standards by pointing to evidence\nthat lack of access to adequately nutritious food as a child is\ncorrelated with health outcomes that no rational or reasonable person\nwould want, such as diabetes. The person could invoke a shared\nconception of justice by claiming that the neighborhood one is born\ninto should not determine one\u2019s health prospects (Bonotti and\nBarnhill 2019; Moles 2013; Nielsen and Jensen 2016).\n\nOthers, by contrast, argue for more restrictive conceptions of public\nreasons. For instance, one popular theory of public reason liberalism\nclaims that a reason is public if and only if it is compatible with\nthe \u2018motivational set\u2019 \u2013 which includes desires,\ndispositions of evaluation, and patterns of emotional reaction \u2013\nof each (idealized) person (Bonotti and Barnhill 2019). Given that at\nleast a few (idealized) people will have a motivational set that is\nincompatible with reasons offered in defense of a public health\nmeasure, very few public health interventions will be supported by\npublic health reasons. Accordingly, this restrictive conception of\npublic reasons has restrictive implications for the mandate of public\nhealth. Without further specification of what is meant by \u2018idealized\u2019\ntaking this position may mean that virtually no public health measures\ncould ever be considered legitimate. Because public health policies\nare by design intended to affect large numbers of people, it is hard\nto imagine any public health policy, or indeed any kind of policy,\nthat is compatible with the motivational set of every affected person.\nThere will always be some who object to a proposed policy because it\nis incompatible with their values. It is not, therefore, a coincidence\nthat those who endorse restrictive conceptions of public reasons also\ntend to identify with the liberty tradition. To return to an earlier\nexample, one reason offered in defense of a soda tax is that the tax\nwill reduce overall obesity and thereby improve population health.\nYet, as we saw, at least some people have motivational sets that\nprioritize having a larger body or enjoying sweet drinks over being\nhealthy \u2013 even if we assume a shared conception of health. Since\nthe reason given in defense of the policy is incompatible with the\nmotivational set of some individuals, it is not a public reason. If\nthe health argument was the only reason in defense of a soda tax, then\nthis version of public reason liberalism would claim that the soda tax\nis illegitimate \u2013 it is not justifiable to (idealized) citizens\n(Bonotti and Barnhill 2019).\n3.3.2 Authoritative Decision \u2013 Procedures\n\nA distinct set of responses to disagreement-based concerns about\nlegitimacy focus on designing authoritative decision-procedures. Many\ndefend the claim that when we disagree about conceptions of the good\nlife or justice, allowing the majority to vote is normatively\nattractive \u2013 or even strictly necessary \u2013 because it\nrespectfully resolves such disagreements (see, e.g., Waldron 1999).\nSome theorists addressing topics in public health have taken a similar\ntack. Given disagreement about various values relevant to population\nhealth, some emphasize the importance of utilizing decision-procedures\nthat include stakeholder input, are transparent, or satisfy various\nother values that are discussed in the context of debates about\ndisagreement and authority (Childress et al. 2002; Emanuel 2002; Goold\net al. 2005; Upshur 2002; Marckmann et al. 2015).\n\nWhile less explored, a different set of questions about institutional\ndesign and disagreement concerns the connection between administrative\nagencies, public health, and democratic decision-making. Public health\ndecision-making often occurs within administrative agencies, where\nunelected officials make value judgments about how to interpret or\nimplement legislation or executive directives (Weinstock 2016). This\nfeature of public health raises interesting legitimacy questions,\nquestions that also crop up for national defense or environmental\nagencies or appointed judges. While of considerable interest and\nimportance for public health ethics, there has been relatively little\nwork addressing this topic. Adequately addressing this gap in the\nliterature would require bringing together work on democratic\nlegitimacy, the legitimacy of administrative agencies, and the\nimplications of both for public health, in particular.\n\nPerhaps the most extensive discussion about legitimate\ndecision-procedures as an appropriate response to normative\ndisagreement concerns disagreements about priority-setting. To give a\nsense of these debates and the broader philosophical issues they\nraise, it is worth focusing on an especially influential framework for\nassessing the legitimacy of decision-making about priority setting and\ncoverage issues relevant to public health, Norman Daniels\u2019s and\nJames Sabin\u2019s Accountability for Reasonableness\n (A4R).[27]\n Initially intended to inform decision-making by private insurance\ncompanies, A4R has since been extended to apply to priority setting\ngenerally and health technology assessment.\n\nThe underlying assumption of A4R is that it is easier to reach\nagreement about a decision-procedure for how to go forward in the face\nof substantive moral disagreements about the appropriate distribution\nof health resources than it is to resolve the underlying substantive\ndisagreements themselves (Daniels 2000; Daniels and Sabin 1997;\nDaniels and Sabin 2008). A4R articulates four conditions that, if\nsatisfied, render a decision-procedure legitimate \u2013 even when\nindividuals disagree about fundamental questions about values or\njustice or the decision reached by the procedure. These four\nconditions are as follows:\n\nThe publicity condition requires that rationales for resource\nallocation must be publicly accessible.\nThe relevance condition requires that decisions must invoke\nrelevant reasons that \u2018fair-minded people\u2019 would accept,\nwhere \u2018fair-minded people\u2019 are those who are\n\u2018disposed to finding mutually justifiable terms of\ncooperation\u2019 (Daniels 2008, 118). Here, A4R draws on the\naforementioned work in public reason theorizing as well as work on\ndeliberative democracy; having fair-minded people offering reasons for\ndifferent policies will yield some degree of consensus, at the very\nleast about which reasons are relevant for making a decision (see the\n entry on democracy).\nThe revision and appeals condition requires that mechanisms be in\nplace to allow for challenges and revisions of decisions when new\nevidence or arguments come to light.\nThe regulative condition (also referred to as the enforcement\ncondition) requires that there be voluntary or public regulation of\nthe process of decision-making.\n\n\nDespite its popularity, many object to A4R. A fundamental objection\nquestions the assumption that motivates A4R \u2013 that arriving at\nagreement on a decision-procedure is more feasible than arriving at\nconsensus on substantive values (Friedman 2008; Dawson and Verweij\n2014; Sabik and Lie 2008). Others debate whether the publicity and\nrevision and appeals conditions are sufficiently democratic (Friedman\n2008, 102) or whether publicity is necessary for legitimacy (de Fine\nLicht 2011; Martin and Giacomini and Singer 2002).\n\nPerhaps the most scrutinized aspect of the A4R is the relevance\ncondition. As we saw in the discussion of public reason, political\ntheorists disagree about which sorts of reasons count as public.\nDaniels claims the only relevant class of reasons are those that\nfair-minded people would accept. He argues that to allow every\nconsideration to count equally would make a consensus impossible and\nthat it would be misguided to accord significant weight to\nconsiderations that fair-minded people would reject (Daniels 2009,\n144).\n\nYet narrowing the class of reasons that count in favor of decisions\nleads to its own problems. The fair-minded and unfair-minded alike\nmight very well disagree about who counts as fair-minded, and,\naccordingly, about which sorts of reasons should count when making\npolicy decisions (Hasman and Holm 2005; Friedman 2008). This leads to\na puzzle about how to determine who counts as fair-minded \u2013\nshould we use another procedure that people could accept in order to\ndetermine which reasons count as those that fair-minded people would\ninvoke? And what should we say to those who espouse reasons that are\ndeemed unsuitable because only the unfair-minded would advance\nthem?\n\nA more fundamental worry is that the focus on which reasons count\ncomplicates rather than helps when trying to reach an acceptable\nresolution to disagreements about various questions relevant to public\nhealth. That is, we need not just to resolve disagreements about the\nimportance of various competing normative considerations when engaged\nin priority-setting, but to resolve disagreements about which\nconsiderations and which reasons should be\n excluded.[28]\n Perhaps the most significant worry about the relevance condition is\nthat it avoids questions of legitimacy that arise due to normative\ndisagreement rather than answering such questions. It is not difficult\nto come to a consensus if we only consider the views of those who\nantecedently agree. Presumably, however, if we accept the importance\nof reaching a decision that is acceptable to people who ultimately\ndisagree with it, then gerrymandering the array of reasons that are\nrelevant to decision-making would seem to be counter-productive.\n",
