    "main_text": "Dialectics\n8. Dialectics\n\nMost of Schleiermacher\u2019s earliest philosophical work as part of\nthe romantic movement was in areas of the subject that might\nreasonably be described as peripheral in comparison with such central\nareas as metaphysics and epistemology (in particular, philosophy of\nreligion, ethics, and hermeneutics). This fact, together no doubt with\nthe imposing presence of several intellectual competitors who had\nrecently made or were making contributions in those central areas\n(including Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel), seems to have spurred\nhim to develop his own treatment of them. The result was his\n\u201cdialectics\u201d, which he began presenting in lecture-form in\n1811. (This subject-title calls to mind relevant approaches not only\nin Plato and Aristotle, but also in Kant and Hegel.)\n\nAccordingly, Schleiermacher\u2019s dialectics in some ways carries\nthe marks of a discipline that he felt forced to develop, rather than\none for which he had a clear, compelling vision (as he had for his\nphilosophy of religion and his hermeneutics, for example). For one\nthing, the nature of the discipline undergoes a striking shift between\nits two earliest versions (the lectures of 1811 and\n1814\u201315)\u2014which have the character of fairly conventional\ntreatments of metaphysical and epistemological issues, already\nconcerned to some extent with resolving disagreements indeed, but in a\npurely theoretical way\u2014and its two main later versions (the\nlectures of 1822 and the book-fragment from 1833), which make the art\nof resolving disagreements through conversation the core of the\ndiscipline (albeit that \u201cconversation\u201d here includes not\nonly the paradigm case of oral communication but also written\ncommunication and even dialogue internal to a single person\u2019s\nmind). This shift might be roughly described as one from a more\nAristotelian to a more Socratic-Platonic conception of\n\u201cdialectics\u201d.\n\nFor another thing, in all of its versions Schleiermacher\u2019s\ndialectics has an oddly rag-bag appearance, including as it does not\nonly material that would naturally be classified as metaphysics and\nepistemology, but also large helpings of philosophy of mind, logic\n(especially the logic of concepts and judgments; Schleiermacher treats\nthe logic of syllogism in a reductive and rather deprecatory way),\nphilosophy of science, and philosophy of religion.\n\nIn its final versions (on which I shall focus here), the discipline\nhas the following character: Its concern is with what Schleiermacher\ncalls \u201cpure thought\u201d, as distinguished from the thought of\neveryday affairs or of art\u2014that is, with thought that aims at\ntruth, rather than merely at achieving practical ends or inventing\nfictions. (Schleiermacher denies, though, that the former is sharply\nseparated from the latter two; rather, it is to some degree implicit\nin them as well as vice versa.)\n\nAccording to Schleiermacher, genuine knowledge of its very nature\nrequires, not only (1) correspondence to reality, but also (2)\nsystematic coherence with all knowledge, and (3) universal\nagreement among people. The main motive behind this elaborate position\nseems to be the thought that there is in principle no way to determine\nthe fulfillment of condition (1) directly, so that believers\nneed to rely on guidance by the fulfillment of conditions (2) and (3).\n(The German scholar Manfred Frank, in a well known early\ninterpretation of Schleiermacher\u2019s dialectics that he gave in\nhis book Das individuelle Allgemeine (1985), accentuated\ncondition (3), attributing to Schleiermacher on the strength of it a\nconsensus theory of truth. However, in his subsequent edition of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s dialectics lectures Frank rightly admitted that\nthis interpretation had overlooked the realism implied by condition\n(1). Incidentally, Frank\u2019s self-correction of the reading of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s dialectics that he had given in Das\nindividuelle Allgemeine also undercuts his equally well known\nearly reading of Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics there, which\nbuilt upon this ascription to Schleiermacher of a consensus theory of\ntruth an ascription to him of a\u2014roughly\nGadamerian\u2014conception of interpretation as an ongoing\nconstruction of facts about meaning through the development of\ninterpretations.)\n\nNot surprisingly given how strong the three conditions just mentioned\nare, Schleiermacher considers genuine knowledge to be only an\n\u201cidea\u201d toward which we can make progress, not something\nthat we can ever actually achieve. (Not coincidentally, this position\nresembles his official positions in hermeneutics and translation\ntheory that the correct understanding of another person and the\ncorrect translation of a text are only goals to which we can\napproximate, not ones that we can ever actually achieve. This is a\ncharacteristically romantic pattern.)\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s dialectics is largely conceived as a\nmethodology for making such progress. This project proceeds relatively\nsmoothly in connection with conditions (1) and (2). For example, in\nconnection with (1), Schleiermacher develops certain principles\nconcerning how to form concepts correctly rather than incorrectly\n(i.e., in such a way that\u2014as a more recent idiom would put\nit\u2014they, their superordinate genus-concepts, their subordinate\nspecies-concepts, and their contrasting coordinate concepts\n\u201ccarve nature at the joints\u201d). And in connection with (2),\nwhile he acknowledges that the task of forming a totality of knowledge\nis of its nature incompletable, he nonetheless prescribes what he\ncalls \u201cheuristic\u201d and \u201carchitectonic\u201d\nprocedures for, respectively, amassing pieces of knowledge and forming\nthem together into a coherent whole.\n\nHowever, the project runs into deeper difficulties in relation to\ncondition (3). There are two main problems here. First, besides the\nobvious and avowed impossibility of actually accessing all people in\norder to come to agreement with them, Schleiermacher also identifies a\nfurther obstacle in the way of reaching, or even making significant\nprogress toward, agreement with them: the deep differences that exist\nbetween different languages and modes of thought. The dialectics\nlectures fail to find any promising way of coping with this problem.\nThe 1822 version attempts to do so in two ways, but neither of them\nlooks hopeful. Its first approach consists in hypothesizing a domain\nof \u201cinnate concepts\u201d that are common to everyone (with\ncertain qualifications, for example, that these concepts require\nsensations in order to be actualized). This would certainly solve the\nproblem, but only by contradicting Schleiermacher\u2019s normal, and\nmore plausible, position, from which the problem arose in the first\nplace, that there is no such conceptual common ground between\nall languages (or even, Schleiermacher normally adds, between all\nindividuals who in some sense share a given language). The second\napproach that the 1822 version tries is an argument that we need to\ndevelop a complete history of the differences in question and of how\nthey arose. However, this proposal seems beside the point\u2014a\ndistraction from the problem rather than a solution to it.\n\nIn his 1833 book-fragment Schleiermacher at some points seems close to\ngiving up on this problem, saying in one place that because of it\ndialectics must restrict itself to a specific \u201clinguistic\nsphere\u201d. But at other points he evidently still clings to the\nhope of finding common ground that unites different \u201clinguistic\nspheres\u201d. What sort of solution does he have in mind? The answer\ncan perhaps be seen from an 1831 address that he delivered on\nLeibniz\u2019s idea of a universal language. In this address he in\neffect argues that it was a mistake on Leibniz\u2019s part to suppose\nthat there was already conceptual common ground shared by\neveryone, which could be captured in a universal language (this also\namounts to a rejection of his own dubious idea in the 1822 lectures of\ncommon \u201cinnate concepts\u201d), but that the sort of conceptual\ncommon ground that Leibniz had thus wrongly envisaged as\nalready existing can nonetheless be achieved (or at\nleast approached) for the sciences in the future, namely, by\ncultivating an attitude of openness to the borrowing of conceptual\nresources from other languages when such resources prove themselves\nuseful for the sciences (a process that, according to Schleiermacher,\nis in fact already strongly underway, and which is realizable either\nthrough borrowing the foreign words in question outright or by\ntranslating them into one\u2019s own language in the sort of\nscrupulous way that his theory of translation advocates).\nSchleiermacher notes that this solution requires an (in any case\nhealthy) shedding of prejudices about the superiority of one\u2019s\nown language, mode of thought, and people over others. This looks like\nSchleiermacher\u2019s most promising solution to the problem in\nquestion. He did not, however, live long enough to develop it in\ndetail or to build on it toward a more complete method for resolving\ninterlinguistic disagreements.\n\nThe second, and perhaps more surprising, problem is that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s dialectics lectures do not even develop a\nsubstantive account of how to resolve disagreements through\nconversation within a \u201clinguistic sphere\u201d.\nHowever, here again it is fortunately possible to supplement the\ndialectics lectures with additional material that goes further in such\na direction. One important text in this connection is\nSchleiermacher\u2019s early essay Toward a Theory of Sociable\nConduct (1799), which is precisely concerned with the art of\nconversation within a linguistic sphere. This early essay emphasizes\nthe importance of finding (conceptual) \u201ccontent\u201d that one\nshares with one\u2019s interlocutor(s), and restricting one\u2019s\nconversation to this. Schleiermacher accordingly recommends that one\nbegin a conversation guided by a sort of minimal estimate of such\ncontent arrived at from one\u2019s knowledge of such things as the\nprofession, the educational background, and the class of one\u2019s\ninterlocutor(s), and that one then tentatively and experimentally work\noutwards toward identifying and exploiting further shared\ncontent\u2014a process that he recommends one should undertake, not\nby the heavy-handed method of introducing doubtfully shared content\ndirectly, but rather by the subtler method of introducing it\nindirectly in the form of a dimension of allusion and satire that one\nadds to one\u2019s treatment of already established shared content\n(after which, if the response from the interlocutor(s) is positive, it\ncan join the previously established shared content as a proper\nsubject-matter for direct treatment).\n\nAnother helpful text in this connection is Schleiermacher\u2019s\nhermeneutics lectures, which implicitly revise the earlier account\njust described in two respects: (a) In that account conversation was\nto be restricted to conceptual content that was already shared between\ninterlocutors. But as we saw previously, by the time Schleiermacher\ndelivers the hermeneutics lectures he is skeptical that people\never really share conceptual content. Consequently, he would\npresumably now set the bar for fruitful conversation somewhat lower\nthan strict sharing. (b) Also, it seems reasonable to infer from his\nconception of hermeneutics that he would now place less emphasis on\ndiscovering pre-existing commonalities, or even near-commonalities,\nand more on refining those found and establishing further\nones\u2014in both cases, with the help of an adept use of the art of\nhermeneutics.\n\nFinally, Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics lectures also supply an\nadditional part of his seemingly missing solution to the problem of\nreaching agreement through conversation, both in inter- and in\nintra-linguistic contexts. Clearly, any art of reaching agreement\nthrough conversation is going to depend on an art of interpreting\ninterlocutors. Accordingly, the dialectics lectures explicitly assert\nthat dialectics is dependent on hermeneutics (as well as vice versa),\nSchleiermacher\u2019s conception of hermeneutics as a universal\ndiscipline ensures its applicability to conversations, and\nSchleiermacher indeed mentions in the hermeneutics lectures that he\nsometimes applies his own hermeneutical principles in conversational\ncontexts. In short, Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics itself\nconstitutes an important component of his art of reaching agreement\nthrough conversation.\n\nIn sum, whereas Schleiermacher\u2019s final conception of dialectics\nas a discipline leads one to expect it to provide a fairly detailed\nset of procedures for resolving both inter- and intra-linguistic\ndisagreements in conversation (analogous to the detailed set of\nprocedures for interpretation that one finds in his hermeneutics),\nthis expectation is largely disappointed by the dialectics lectures\nthemselves. However, one can supplement them from other texts in order\nto see how Schleiermacher might have envisaged a fuller solution to\nthis task.\n\nOne last point that should be mentioned in this connection is the\nfollowing. Schleiermacher\u2019s most prominent motive for developing\nsuch an art of conversation is the epistemological one described\nabove. That may or may not be a good motive in the end. However,\nSchleiermacher also has further, independent motives behind this art\nthat are more obviously attractive. Thus, his 1831 address on Leibniz\nimplies two additional motives behind the intercultural side of the\nart: first, Schleiermacher\u2019s cosmopolitan concern for humanity\nas a whole in all of its diversity constitutes a moral reason for\npromoting fruitful intercultural dialogue; and second, his sense that\ninsight, far from being a monopoly of ours, is dispersed among many\ncultures constitutes another reason for us to engage in such dialogue.\nSchleiermacher would presumably say that analogous considerations help\nto justify the intracultural side of the art as well. In addition, the\nessay Toward a Theory of Sociable Conduct emphasizes yet\nanother motive behind the intracultural side of the art. In this essay\nSchleiermacher does not yet mention his later epistemological motive\nat all, but instead focuses on more direct benefits that he expects to\naccrue from fruitful conversation between members of society, in\nparticular the individual\u2019s enrichment of his own limited\nperspective through an incorporation of the different perspectives of\nother people. Schleiermacher would presumably say that an analogous\nconsideration helps to justify the intercultural side of the art as\nwell. In short, even if it were to turn out that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s predominant epistemological motive for\ndeveloping an art of inter- and intra-cultural conversation were\nunpersuasive, such an art might still be valuable for other reasons\nthat he also has in mind such as these ones.\n\nFinally, a few further positions that Schleiermacher develops in his\ndialectics should also be mentioned, albeit more briefly. One rather\nstriking position is a denial that any concepts, thoughts, or\ncognitions are either purely a priori in character or purely\nempirical\u2014either the product of the \u201cintellectual\u201d\nfunction alone or of the \u201corganic\u201d function alone. Rather,\nall are the product of both functions\u2014though the\nproportions in which they are involved vary from case to\ncase.\n\nMore specifically, as Schleiermacher conceives the situation, all are\nlocated on a continuum that stretches between the maximally\n\u201cintellectual\u201d ideas of Being or God and the maximally\n\u201corganic\u201d chaos of sensations. These two extremes do not\nthemselves involve mixture: Being or God is purely intellectual, while\nthe chaos of sensations is purely organic. However, they do not for\nthat reason constitute counterexamples to the position just mentioned,\nbecause they are not themselves strictly speaking concepts, thoughts,\nor cognitions.\n\nAs was mentioned previously, Schleiermacher\u2019s theory of concepts\nalso says that these are in each case defined by relations of\nsubsumption under higher concepts, contrast with correlative concepts\nsimilarly subsumed, and subsumption of further concepts under them.\nSubsumption under the non-concept Being and the subsumption of a class\nof primitive judgments concerning sensations constitute special cases\nat the two extremes of this conceptual hierarchy.\n\nAnother position that Schleiermacher holds is that the (Kantian)\ndistinction between analytic and synthetic judgments is a merely\n\u201crelative\u201d one. Part of his reason for this position seems\nto lie in his view that all judgments are partly empirical in nature\n(a consideration that anticipates Quine). But what he mainly seems to\nhave in mind here is that it is always in some sense up to us to\ndecide how many and which characteristic marks to build into any given\nsubject concept, and therefore how many and which judgments in which\nthat subject concept features will count as analytic or as\nsynthetic.\n\nA last feature of Schleiermacher\u2019s dialectics is more puzzling.\nSchleiermacher notes at one point that he wants to chart a sort of\nmiddle course between ancient dialectics, which had the virtue of\nopenness but the vice of courting skepticism, and the dogmatism of the\nscholastics, for whom everything of importance was pre-decided in a\nreligious principle that they presupposed. His concession to the\nformer position has in effect already been described above. But what\nabout his concession to the latter? This takes the form of positing a\n\u201ctranscendental ground\u201d or God which is (1) beyond all\noppositions, including those of thought/reality, thought/volition, and\nconcept/judgment, (2) beyond Being (even though Being is itself beyond\nsuch oppositions), (3) an essential impulse behind, and accompaniment\nof, all attempts to know, and (4) not thinkable or linguistically\nexpressible but instead felt. This is all rather mysterious. For\nexample, the philosophical rationale for positing such a\n\u201ctranscendental ground\u201d or God as beyond rather than\nidentical with Being is obscure, and so too is the exact way in which\nit is supposed to be the impulse behind, and accompaniment of, all\nattempts to know.\n",
