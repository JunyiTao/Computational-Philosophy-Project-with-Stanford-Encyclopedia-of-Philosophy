Related Developments and Further Challenges\n\nThe battle of the big systems seems to be over, and likewise for the\nheyday of interdisciplinary departments and programs of history and\nphilosophy of science (but see below). So are historicist conceptions\nof rationality dead? Despite claims that historicist philosophy of\nscience has been \u201cwithering on the vine\u201d (Fuller 1991), it\nis fair to say that historicist influences remain important, but in a\nsubtler way. Most philosophers of science are more historically\nsensitive than before, whether or not they identify as historicists.\nHistoricist interests have expanded into \u201cthe naturalistic\nturn\u201d, \u201cthe models turn\u201d, and \u201cthe practice\nturn\u201d, which includes interest in contemporary practices, and,\nto a lesser degree, in future history (Nickles forthcoming).\n\nMoreover, in parallel developments, the classical conception of\nrationality is under attack on many fronts. Herbert Simon (1947)\nintroduced the ideas of bounded rationality and satisficing. Simon\nlater championed the need for a heuristic approach to problem solving\nby humans and computers (Newell & Simon 1972). Various flavors of\nartificial intelligence then led the way in the methodology of problem\nsolving, with heuristics as a central topic and no longer the temporary\nscaffolding of positivism and Popper. Simon\u2019s program in\nadaptive, \u201cecological rationality\u201d is now being expanded\nby Gerd Gigerenzer and the Adaptive Behavior and Cognition group in\nBerlin (Gigerenzer et al. 1999). Simon\u2019s approach and the\n\u201cheuristics and biases\u201d program of Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky (Kahneman et al. 1982), plus work by the\nlatter on prospect theory, triggered the emergence of behavioral\neconomics, which rejects the neo-classical homo economicus\nrationality model. Philosopher Christopher Cherniak\u2019s\nMinimal Rationality (1986) also brought out sharply how\nidealized were traditional philosophical assumptions about\nrationality. In other directions, some computer scientists are\nchallenging the anthropocentrism of received conceptions of rational\ninference by asking why artificial intelligence, including deep\nlearning, should be restricted to human forms of reasoning. Meanwhile,\nbiologists and philosophers are studying the evolution of rationality\n(Okasha & Binmore 2012), and ethologists ask why we should\nwithhold attributions of rationality to animals from chimps and\nelephants to octopuses, simply because they seem to lack a human sort\nof conceptual language.\n\nNonetheless, there is wide agreement that historicist accounts of\nscientific rationality cannot fully supplant traditional views. For\nexample, there surely does exist some \u201cinstant\nrationality\u201d even at research frontiers. One finds a wide\nvariety of decision contexts there, and some of these decisions will\nbe uncontroversially warranted at that time and in that context, while\nothers will not be. Hesse (1980) and many others (see Radnitzky &\nAndersson 1978) raised the issue of how to generalize from historical\ncase studies, for citing case studies can be like citing the\nBible. One can cherry-pick one\u2019s case studies to\nsupport most any position. In any case it is fallacious to generalize\nfrom a few, highly contextualized case studies to conclusions about\nall science at all times. Early historical work in social studies of\nscience faced the same problem. Ironically, such generalization\nabstracts away from the historicity of the case studies themselves.\nThe attempt to replace inductive generalization by testing via an H-D\nmodel also runs into trouble, as we noted in connection to the\nVirginia Tech project. And why should case studies from two or three\nhundred years ago be taken seriously when science itself has changed\nsignificantly in the meantime? Partly for this reason Ronald Giere\n(1973) contended that it was necessary to study only today\u2019s\nscientific practices, that philosophers had no special need of\nconsulting historians.\n\nLate in life, Kuhn himself, surprisingly, rejected the case-study method as too\nwedded to the traditional view of science as a direct search for the\ntruth about the universe. The first generations of historical inquiry\nby philosophers and sociologists so shockingly revealed the presence\nof many non-epistemic factors and the general failure of any method\nfully to justify scientific beliefs, he said, that skepticism was the\nresult. The more people learned about how science is actually done,\nthe more skeptical they became. Declared Kuhn, we can more securely\nderive historical patterning \u201cfrom first principles\u201d and\n\u201cwith scarcely a glance at the historical record itself\u201d\n(1991: 111ff). This is not a complete departure from history, however,\nfor it begins from what he termed \u201cthe historical\nperspective\u201d, a non-whiggish understanding of the decisions\nactually available to the historical actors in their own context.\nKuhn\u2019s main point is that such decisions should be considered\ncomparative (\u201cIs this item better than that one, given the\ncontextual knowledge and standards?\u201d), not as judgments of truth\nor probability. This move reduces the problem of understanding\nbehavior in rational terms to something manageable, he explained.\nDeveloping this point, Kuhn said, will bring the only defensible sort\nof rationality back into scientific practice in a way that largely\navoids the old problems of incommensurability. It will also provide a\ndefensible concept of scientific progress and of scientific\nknowledge (almost by definition)\u2014knowledge as what the\nscientific process produces. This historical perspective was part of\nKuhn\u2019s project of developing a biological analogy for the\ndevelopment of science, wherein disciplinary speciation events\ncorrespond to revolutions. Kuhn held that his approach applied to all\nhuman enterprises, not just science (Kuhn 2000).\n\nRecently, Rogier De Langhe (2014a,b,c, 2017) has been developing a\nbroadly Kuhnian, two-process account of science from an economics\nstandpoint. Instead of doing a series of historical cases, De Langhe\nand colleagues are developing algorithms to detect subtle patterns in\nthe large citation databases now available. In sum, both late Kuhn and\nearly De Langhe are now appealing to the history of science in a more\nabstract, or perhaps comprehensive, manner, a manner complementary to the two-process approach of\nMichael Friedman (below).\n\nAnother general challenge for historicists and others concerned with\nthe rationality of science is how to factor the division of labor in\nscience into a model of scientific rationality. How does individual\nrationality (the traditional focus of economists as well as\nphilosophers) relate to the collective rationality of working groups\nor entire specialist communities? (See Sarkar 1983; Kitcher 1993;\nMirowski 1996; Downes 2001; De Langhe 2014b; Latour 1987 and later for his\nactor-network theory; and the entry on\n social epistemology.)\n Feminist philosophers such as Longino (1990, 2001) and Solomon (2001)\nhave proposed more thoroughgoing social epistemologies of science that\ngo beyond the problem of division of labor, which, in their view, is\nstill often treated individualistically.\n",
