    "main_text": "Dialetheism, Paraconsistency, and Aristotle\n12. Posterior Analytics I 11\n\nThis is an intriguing and relatively neglected text. At first sight it\nlooks as if Aristotle is presenting a valid argument that includes\ncontradictions as some of the premises, which would be surprising\ngiven his account of PNC in Metaphysics IV. However, the text\nis even more obscure than usual.\n\nThere are two basic interpretations. According to one interpretation,\nAristotle does indeed include contradictions, but these are idle and\nplay no real logical role in the argument he presents. According to\nthe other interpretation, following Aquinas\u2019s commentary\n(lecture 20), Aristotle is not claiming that Callias both is and is\nnot Callias or that he is and is not a human being, for example, but\nthat the term \u201canimal\u201dcovers Callias and those who are not\nCallias and not human beings, as Aristotle himself explains when he\nsays that the major term (\u201canimal\u201d) is more extensive than\nthe middle term (\u201chuman\u201d). (In the syllogism All\nAs are Bs; All Bs are Cs;\ntherefore All As are Cs, \u201cA\u201d is the\nmajor term and \u201cB\u201d is the middle term.)\n\nThere are difficulties with both interpretations. Aristotle starts by\nsaying that no demonstration assumes PNC unless it concludes that\nx is F and not not-F. According to the\nfirst interpretation, Aristotle\u2019s explanation about the major\nand middle term is unnecessary. However, according to the second\ninterpretation, the relationship between Aristotle\u2019s main point\nand his comments about PNC is obscure. The text invites further\nelucidation.\n",
