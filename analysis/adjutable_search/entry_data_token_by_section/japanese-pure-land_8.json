    "main_text": "Contours of Pure Land Buddhist Thought || Cosmic Buddhas and Buddha-fields\n2.4 Cosmic Buddhas and Buddha-fields\n\nEven in the early Buddhist tradition, Sakyamuni\u2019s attainment of\nawakening was not regarded as an utterly unique event or even the\nfirst occurrence of buddhahood. Nevertheless, the appearance of a\nbuddha, who bears the epochal role of bringing liberation to beings\nthrough teaching, was regarded as a momentous event in the history of\nthe world. The early tradition had taught instead the ideal of the\narhat, who would enter into nirvana upon death, having completely\neradicated blind passions and attained emancipation from further\nrebirth within the world of samsaric existence.\n\nThe Mahayana tradition, however, recognized the attainment of\nbuddhahood itself\u2014not merely deliverance from afflicting\npassions and samsaric existence\u2014as the genuine goal of religious\npractice and proclaimed it, along with the engagement with beings in\nsamsara that it implied, as the supreme fulfillment for all sentient\nbeings since the beginningless past. It is natural, therefore, that\nMahayana Buddhists recognize the present existence of vast numbers of\ncelestial buddhas and bodhisattvas who had already reached\nattainment.\n\nFurther, it was assumed in Indian Buddhism that two buddhas could not\nappear in a single epoch of a world system, any more than two\n\u201cuniversal monarchs\u201d (cakravartin) could rule\nsimultaneously. Thus, the existence of innumerable buddhas implied\nthat there are myriads of purified buddha-fields over which they\npreside, for it may be expected that, through aeons of history in\nnumberless worlds, countless beings will have attained supreme\nawakening by following the bodhisattva path, and these beings all work\nfor the liberation of others in their own spheres of realization.\nMahayana writings often refer to the concept of the \u201cgreat\nchiliocosm,\u201d which is made up of one billion universes. In the\nMahayana cosmology, there are great chiliocosms countless as the sands\nof the Ganges throughout the ten quarters, and most are buddha-fields,\nor parts of buddha-fields, in which a buddha teaches dharma for the\nbenefit of its inhabitants. Our own universe\u2014called the\nSah\u0101 world, or \u201cworld in which pain must be\nendured\u201d\u2014is the buddha-field of Sakyamuni, the sphere in\nwhich he appeared in order to save the beings within it. Thus, the\nentire cosmos is a panoply of countless buddha-fields in which the\ndrama of the salvation of all beings is carried out, with buddhas and\nbodhisattvas radiating the light of wisdom-compassion for all living\nthings.\n",
