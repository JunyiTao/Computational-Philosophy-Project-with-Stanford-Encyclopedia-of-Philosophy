    "main_text": "Personhood and Social Status\n5. Personhood and Social Status\n\n\nMany commentators agree with Gyekye that the essential ingredient of a\nhuman is what the Akan refers to as okra.  There is, however,\nsome disagreement over the nature of okra. According to\nGyekye,\n\n\nthe okra is that which constitute the innermost self, the\nessence, of the individual person. Okra is individual's\nlife, for which reason it is usually referred to as\nokrateasefo, that is, the living soul, a seeming tautology\nthat yet is significant. The expression is intended to emphasize that\nokra is identical with life. The okra is the\ntransmitter of the individual's destiny (fate:\nnkrabea).  It is explained as a spark of the Supreme\nBeing. The presence of this divine essence in a human being may have\nbeen the basis of the Akan proverb, \u201cAll men are the children of\nGod; no one is the child of the earth (Gyekye 1987,\n85).\n\n\nWhile Gyekye maintains that okra can be accurately rendered\ninto English as \u2018soul,\u2019 Wiredu insists upon drawing a\nsomewhat more subtle distinction between these concepts. For Wiredu\nokra is \u201cthat whose presence in the body means life and\nwhose absence means death and which also received the\nindividual's destiny from God\u201d (Wiredu 1983, 119).  Of\npivotal importance to their disagreement is the normative implication\nof the presence of okra. The normative implication is that\nokra bestows on its possessors basic irreducible respect\nmatched by basic irreducible human rights.\n\n\nLike Wiredu, Gyekye recognizes that there are standards for which\nindividual persons aim that have an important role in how people think\nof themselves and their place in society. Unlike Wiredu, however,\nGyekye denies that facts about a person's ambitions or goals add\nor subtract from that individual's status as a person,\n\n\nThe individual may fail in his strivings and, in the Akan community,\nfor example, may consequently be judged as a \u201cuseless\nperson\u201d (onipa hun), an opprobrium term. But it must be\nnoted that what the individual would be striving for in all these\nexertions is some social status not personhood. The striving are in\nfact part of the individual's self-expression, an exercise of a\ncapacity he has a person. Even if at the end of the day he\nfailed to attain the expected status, his personhood would not for\nthat reason diminish, even though he may lose social respect in the\neyes of the community. So that it is social status not personhood at\nwhich individuals could fail (Wiredu & Gyekye 1992, 111 note\n20).\n\n\nInstead, then, of treating persons as a kind of individual that\nadmits of degrees, Gyekye employs criteria of personhood that are quite\nindependent of individual aims and actions. He maintains that, while\npersons may differ with respect to how they are treated in a community,\nthis difference is a matter of the social status accorded each, not\nfacts about their status as persons. \n",
