    "main_text": "Extensions of the Theory of Descriptions || Plural, mass, and generic descriptions\n4.4 Plural, mass, and generic descriptions\n\nSo far we have discussed singular definite and indefinite descriptions\n(and the possibility that names are descriptions) but as it turns out\nthese types of descriptions are probably not the most commonly\noccurring descriptions in English. Ultimately we also want to take\ninto account plural descriptions (as in \u2018the dogs are\nbarking\u2019), mass noun descriptions (as in \u2018the water is\ncold\u2019), and generics (as in \u2018the dog is a loyal\nfriend\u2019). The question is whether each of these constructions\nmust be treated in a different way, or whether it is possible to unify\ntheir treatment with the analysis of definite descriptions discussed\nabove. Sharvy (1980) suggested that a unified treatment is indeed\npossible (this is also a possibility that Chomsky (1975) saw).\n\nSharvy\u2019s idea was that we could generalize Russell\u2019s\ntheory of descriptions by \u2018the F (or Fs) is\n(are) G\u2019 to be equivalent to the following,\n\n(32) \u2203x(Fx &\n\u2200y(Fy \u2192 y \u2264 x)\n& Gx)\n\n\nwhere F can be either a singular count noun (like\n\u2018dog\u2019), a plural count noun (like \u2018dogs\u2019) or a\nmass noun (like \u2018water\u2019), and the symbol\n\u2018\u2264\u2019 indicates a parthood relation. Following Brogaard\n(2007) we can take this as saying \u2018an F that every\nF is part of satisfies \u201cG\u201d\u2019. It\nfollows then, that a definite description \u2018the F\u2019\n(\u2018the Fs\u2019) denotes the maximal sum or mass in the\nextension of F. So, for example, when we utter \u2018The\ndogs\u2019 we are denoting the maximal set of dogs in the domain of\ndiscourse. When we utter \u2018the water\u2019, we are denoting the\nmaximal mass of water in the discourse. In the case of singular\ndefinite descriptions (like \u2018the dog\u2019) we are still\ndenoting the maximal set of dogs in the domain of discourse (since in\nthis case there is only one dog). In effect, singular definite\ndescriptions are just special cases of Sharvy\u2019s generalized\ntheory of descriptions.\n\nFara (2001) argued that the same strategy can be extended to generics\nas well.\n\n(33) The dog is related to the wolf.\n\n\nIf natural kinds like species and sub-species can bear the parthood\nrelation to one another, then one can extend the Sharvy parthood\noperator to these cases as well. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that\nSharvy\u2019s analysis of these constructions has no competitors, but\nthe fact that he was able to give a unified treatment of these\nconstructions suggests that competitors will have to do the same. It\nreally does seem as though singular, plural, mass, and generic\ndescriptions are not so different in kind. A unified Russellian\ntreatment of the constructions seems possible. In section 7 we will\nreturn to the question of whether the maximality claim should be part\nof the analysis or whether it represents a weakness in the\nanalysis.\n",
