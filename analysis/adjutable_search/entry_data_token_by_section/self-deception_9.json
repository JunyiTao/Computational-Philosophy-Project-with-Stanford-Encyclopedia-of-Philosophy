    "main_text": "Morality and Self-Deception || Moral Responsibility for Self-Deception\n5.1 Moral Responsibility for Self-Deception\n\nWhether self-deceivers can be held responsible for their\nself-deception is largely a question of whether they have the\nrequisite control over the acquisition and maintenance of their\nself-deceptive belief. In general, intentionalists hold that\nself-deceivers are responsible since they intend to acquire the\nself-deceptive belief, usually recognizing the evidence to the\ncontrary. Even when the intention is indirect, such as when one\nintentionally seeks evidence in favor of p or avoids\ncollecting or examining evidence to the contrary, self-deceivers seem\nto intentionally flout their own normal standards for gathering and\nevaluating evidence. So, minimally, they are responsible for such\nactions and omissions.\n\nInitially, non-intentionalist approaches may seem to remove the agent\nfrom responsibility by rendering the process by which she is\nself-deceived subintentional. If my anxiety, fear, or desire triggers\na process that ineluctably leads me to hold the self-deceptive belief,\nit seems I cannot be held responsible for holding that belief. How\ncould I be held responsible for processes that operate without my\nknowledge and which are set in motion without my intention? Most\nnon-intentionalist accounts, however, do allow for the possibility\nthat self-deceivers are responsible for individual episodes of\nself-deception or for the vices of cowardice and lack of self-control\nfrom which they spring. To be morally responsible in the sense of\nbeing an appropriate target for praise or blame requires, at least,\nthat agents have control over the actions in question. Mele (2001),\nfor example, argues that many sources of bias are controllable and\nthat self-deceivers can recognize and resist the influence of emotion\nand desire on their belief acquisition and retention, particularly in\nmatters they deem to be important\u2014morally or otherwise. The\nextent of this control, however, is an empirical question. Nelkin\n(2012) argues that since Mele\u2019s account leaves the content of\nmotivation driving the bias unrestricted, the mechanism in question is\nso complex that \u201cit seems unreasonable to expect the\nself-deceiver to guard against\u201d its operation.\n\nOther non-intentionalists take self-deceivers to be responsible for\ncertain epistemic vices, such as cowardice in the face of fear or\nanxiety and lack of self-control with respect to the biasing\ninfluences of desire and emotion. Thus, Barnes (1997) argues that\nself-deceivers \u201ccan, with effort, in some circumstances, resist\ntheir biases\u201d (83) and \u201ccan be criticized for failing to\ntake steps to prevent themselves from being biased; they can be\ncriticized for lacking courage in situations where having courage is\nneither superhumanly difficult nor costly\u201d (175). Whether\nself-deception is due to a character defect or not, ascriptions of\nresponsibility depend upon whether the self-deceiver has control over\nthe biasing effects of her desires and emotions.\n\nSome question whether self-deceivers do have such control. For\ninstance, Levy (2004) has argued that deflationary accounts of\nself-deception that deny the contradictory belief requirement should\nnot suppose that self-deceivers are typically responsible since it is\nrarely the case that self-deceivers possess the requisite awareness of\nthe biasing mechanisms operating to produce their self-deceptive\nbelief. Lacking such awareness, self-deceivers do not appear to know\nwhen or on which beliefs such mechanisms operate, rendering them\nunable to curb the effects of these mechanisms, even when they operate\nto form false beliefs about morally significant matters. Lacking the\ncontrol necessary for moral responsibility in individual episodes of\nself-deception, self-deceivers seem also to lack control over being\nthe sort of person disposed to self-deception.\n\nNon-intentionalists may respond by claiming that self-deceivers often\nare aware of the potentially biasing effects their desires and\nemotions might have and can exercise control over them (DeWeese-Boyd\n2007). They might also challenge the idea that self-deceivers must be\naware in the ways Levy suggests. One well-known account of control,\nemployed by Levy, holds that a person is responsible just in case she\nacts on a mechanism that is moderately responsive to reasons\n(including moral reasons), such that were she to possess such reasons,\nthis same mechanism would act upon those reasons in at least one\npossible world (Fischer and Ravizza 1999). Guidance control, in this\nsense, requires that the mechanism in question be capable of\nrecognizing and responding to moral and non-moral reasons sufficient\nfor acting otherwise. Nelkin (2011, 2012), however, argues that\nreasons-responsiveness should be seen as applying primarily to the\nagent, not the mechanism, requiring only that the agent has\nthe capacity to exercise reason in the situation under scrutiny. The\nquestion isn\u2019t whether the biasing mechanism itself is\nreasons-responsive but whether the agent governing its operation\nis\u2014that is, whether self-deceivers typically could recognize and\nrespond to moral and non-moral reasons to resist the influence of\ntheir desires and emotions and instead exercise special scrutiny of\nthe belief in question. According to Nelkin (2012), expecting\nself-deceivers to have such a capacity is more likely if we understand\nthe desire driving their bias as a desire to believe that\np, since awareness of this sort of desire would make it\neasier to guard against its influence on the process of determining\nwhether p. Van Loon (2018) points out that discussion of\nmoral responsibility and reasons-responsiveness have focused on\nactions and omissions that indirectly affect belief formation when it\nis more appropriate to focus on epistemic reasons-responsiveness.\nAttitudinal control, not action control, is what is at issue in\nself-deception. Drawing on McHugh\u2019s (2013, 2014, 2017) account\nof attitudinal control, Van Loon argues that self-deceivers on\nMele-style deflationary accounts are responsible for their\nself-deceptive beliefs because they recognize and react to evidence\nagainst their self-deceptive belief across a wide-range of\ncounter-factual scenarios even though their recognition of this\nevidence does not alter their belief and their reaction to such\nevidence leads them viciously to hold the self-deceptive belief.\n\nGaleotti (2016b) rejects the idea that control is the best way to\nthink about responsibility in cases of self-deception since\nself-deceivers on deflationary approaches seem both confused and\nrelatively powerless over the process. Instead, following a modified\nversion of Sher\u2019s (2009) account of responsibility, she contends\nthat self-deceivers typically have, but fail to recognize, evidence\nthat their acts related to belief formation are wrong or foolish and\nso fall below some applicable standard (epistemic, moral, etc.). The\nself-deceiver is under motivational pressure, not incapacitated, and\non exiting self-deception, recognizes \u201cthe faultiness of her\ncondition and feels regret and shame at having fooled herself\u201d\n(Galeotti 2016b). This ex-post reasons-responsiveness\nsuggests self-deceivers are responsible in Sher\u2019s sense even if\ntheir self-deception is not intentional.\n\nIn view of these various ways of cashing out responsibility,\nit\u2019s plausible that self-deceivers can be morally responsible\nfor their self-deception on deflationary approaches and certainly not\nobvious that they couldn\u2019t be.\n",
