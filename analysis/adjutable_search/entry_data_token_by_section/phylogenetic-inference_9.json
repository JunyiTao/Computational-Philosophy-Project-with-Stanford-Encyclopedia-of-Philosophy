Looking Ahead: New Challenges and Opportunities\n\nWe began by noting that a phylogeny reconstructs evolutionary history\nand that different types of entities have an evolutionary\nhistory\u2014for example, genes, organisms, populations, and species\nall have genealogical histories. Assume that we are trying to\nreconstruct the history of species or higher taxa (indeed,\n\u201cphylogeny\u201d itself is sometimes defined this way, e.g.,\nWiley 1981; S. Edwards 2009). Standard methods such as parsimony,\nlikelihood, and bayesian methods all directly infer the history of\ncharacters. So what is the connection between the history of these\ncharacters and the phylogeny of the species? The unstated assumption\nis that the histories of these characters are the same and line up\nwith the species history. We conclude this entry by acknowledging that\nthis unstated assumption is often violated and we consider what effect\nthis has on the theory and practice of phylogenetic inference. As we\nwill see, examining this unstated assumption forces us to directly\nface the question of what a phylogeny actually represents and thus\nwhat \u201cphylogenetic inference\u201d even means.\n\nIn order to facilitate an entry point into this topic we treated\nphylogenetic trees and the histories they represent as simple\nbifurcating entities, i.e., as straight-forward branch-and-node\nstructures. Yet, this is an idealization, and actual phylogenetic\nhistories are typically more complex than this. Branches can fuse\ntogether, and branching events turn out to be more complex than the\nunidimensional instantaneous point a node might suggest.\n\nAs philosophers of science are well aware, idealization in science is\nboth common and serves important purposes (e.g., Cartwright 1983;\nMcMullin 1985; Wimsatt 2007; Weisberg 2007). Yet, it can be fruitful\nto pause and consider if some of these idealizations and simplifying\nassumptions need to be re-examined, are hindering studies, or\ngenerating other road blocks. Indeed, that\u2019s precisely what has\nhappened recently in phylogenetics. Re-examining the utility of\nsimplifying assumptions in phylogenetics has come both from outside\nthe field (particularly from microbiology) and internally (as\nphylogeneticists began to appreciate what might be gained from\nincorporating more complexity). This is (or, at least, can be) a good\nand healthy thing for a science. It puts pressure on scientists and\nphilosophers to further articulate the central commitments of a\nscience, and to consider how to account for new challenges. Challenges\ncan also push a science to adapt and revise those central commitments\nas new evidence, theories, and tools are discovered or developed, or\nto revisit the utility of underlying simplifying assumptions and\nidealizations. This, in turn, helps philosophers of science understand\nhow science can advance. (Haber 2019 describes this in the context of\nphylogenetics as productive disruptions.)\n\nRevisiting the utility of idealizing away the complexity of\nphylogenetic histories has generated both hard challenges and new\nopportunities for phylogeneticists moving forward (Haber 2012, 2019;\nVelasco 2012). Here we provide a brief overview of what relaxing these\nassumptions amounts to, and what kinds of complexity we are\nacknowledging when these assumptions no longer hold. Following this,\nwe briefly describe how this impacts the central commitments and\nproject of phylogenetics.\n",
