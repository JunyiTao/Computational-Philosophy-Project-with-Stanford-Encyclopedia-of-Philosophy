    "main_text": "Models of Brahman, God, and the Dao || Models of the Dao\n2.3 Models of the Dao\n\nThe idea of the Dao (Way, Path, Guide) emerged during the Warring\nStates period in China (fifth to second centuries BCE), when the\nreigning idea of Tian (Heaven) as a kind of personal god or\nGod started to shatter along with the rest of the imperial structures\nof the Zhou Dynasty. Chinese thinkers faced their version of the\nproblem of evil: \u201cWhy is Tian letting this chaos\npersist?\u201d and added \u201cWhere is the dao to\nharmony?\u201d (Perkins 2019; Miller 2003: 37). An extended debate\narose among different schools of thought arguing for different answers\n(Zu\u0308rn 2018: 300ff), including two schools that have endured: the\nearly Ru (Confucian) thinkers who said the dao could be\nbrought back into the human world by reestablishing right social\nrelationships and customs, and the early or\n proto-Daoists[44]\n who found a new focus in the dao in the impersonal,\nconsistent patterns of the non-human natural world. The\nDaodejing (ca. sixth to fourth centuries BCE, hereafter\n\u201cDDJ\u201d) is the earliest Daoist text that reads\nthese natural patterns as evidence of a single force or principle of\nall that there is\u2014as a single metaphysical ultimate\u2014and\n\u201ctentatively\u201d, as Perkins (2019) says well, names this\nultimate \u201cthe dao\u201d or in some translations\n\u201cthe Dao\u201d or \u201cDao\u201d. Though\nthis entry will focus mainly on the Daoist tradition and use the word\n\u201cDao\u201d (hereafter not italicized) to refer to it, the\nres in question runs under other important names and concepts\nin both the Daoist and Ru traditions, including Taiji (Great\nUltimate or Grand One), Xuan Tian (Dark Heaven),\nZhen (Truth or noumenal Reality) and conjoined with\nTian as Tiandao in Ruism.\n\nGradually, the early Daoist thinkers took the Dao to have multiple\nfunctional roles\u2014metaphysically, as the cosmos\u2019 origin,\nits pattern or structure (ti), its functioning\n(yong); and soteriologically as a guide through the cosmos\nfor humans, as Robin Wang says (DDJ ch. 25, Wang 2012: 47).\nCombining the Dao\u2019s role as the origin of all things with its\nundeniable unitariness threw Daoist thinkers into the question of how\nthe One became Many, and thus into a focus on cosmogony. The Daoist\ncosmogonists generally agreed, and agree now, on at least six things\nabout the Dao (the last general model this entry will\nshowcase)\u2014though there is substantial diversity in\ninterpretations of each which help constitute various thinkers\u2019\nmodels of the Dao.\n\nFirst, in a seeming nod to the consistent patterns of the universe\nthat encouraged postulation of the Dao in the first place, the Dao is\ntaken to be immanent in everything. As the Zhuangzi says,\n\n\nThere\u2019s no place [the Dao] doesn\u2019t exist\u2026.It is in\nthe panic grass\u2026.in the tiles and shards\u2026in the piss and\nshit!\u2026\u201cComplete\u201d, \u201cuniversal\u201d,\n\u201call-inclusive\u201d\u2014all point to a single reality.\n(Zhuangzi, sec. 22, Watson translation)\n\n\nSecond, because it is capable of singlehandedly originating\neverything, the Dao is taken to be necessarily ziran, meaning\n\u201cself-so\u201d or \u201cspontaneous\u201d, which is read as\nentailing something like the kind of necessity and aseity of being\ncausa sui in the Thomist tradition (Perkins 2019). Wang\nexplains the entailment in her explication of a famous passage\n(\u201cHuman beings follow earth, earth follows heaven, heaven\nfollows dao, and dao follows ziran\u201d):\nthe Dao\u2019s following ziran arrests the regress because\n\u201cfollowing\u201d spontaneity is the opposite of following since\nspontaneity is making it up yourself on the fly (DDJ, ch. 25;\nWang 2012: 51).\n\nWhat is the nature of a ziran generator of all things, then?\nZhuangzi answers in his inimitable way: \u201cwhat things things is\nnot itself a thing\u201d (ch. 11, see Schipper 1982 [1993: 115]). In\nother words, the third commonly held claim is that the Dao is no\nthing, nothing, nonbeing (wu). Bin Song (2018) helpfully\ndisambiguates several readings of nonbeing, including as (a) sheer\nnothingness, a great vacuum \u201cbefore\u201d time and things; or\n(b) abstract forms not yet made concrete, e.g., Zhu-Xi\u2019s\n\u201cpattern-principles\u201d or Wang\u2019s \u201cpatterns and\nprocesses of interrelatedness\u201d (2018: 48) or, instead of\nnothingness or abstractness, (c) concrete no-thingness, i.e., a\ntotally undetermined whole of being, stuff without form. Song and Poul\nAndersen favor option (c), translating a key phrase in DDJ 21\nthat describes the Dao as a \u201ccomplete blend\u201d and as having\n\u201cmurky indistinctness\u201d, respectively (Song 2018:\n224\u2013230, Andersen 2019: 131\u2013132). Another line in that\nchapter also tells against the Dao\u2019s being sheer\nnothingness:\n\n\nyet within it is a substance, within it is an essence, quite genuine,\nwithin it, something that can be tested. (DDJ, Lau\ntranslation)\n\n\nOn any of these readings of nonbeing, it is clear why the Dao is taken\nto be impersonal: the Dao is not only not anthropomorphic; it is not\neven thingmorphic. It is also clear why it is taken to be ineffable:\nit is not just because its being is beyond us; it is also because it\nis not a being at all, and most uses of words (to talk like Zhuangzi)\nthing it. So we find Daoist texts using the tricks of the ineffability\ntrade to talk about the Dao, including famously, e.g., a use of the\nvia negativa in the opening line of the DDJ:\n\u201cthe way that can be spoken of is not the constant\nway\u2026\u201d Also, in an expression that is perhaps less about\nthe Dao\u2019s ineffability and more about the futility of finding it\nintellectually, there is Zhuangzi\u2019s dynamic semper\nnegativa of \u201ccontinuous self-negation\u201d or\n\u201cunsaying\u201d, visible also in the Buddhist tradition and in\nTillich millennia after and oceans away:\n\n\nThere is being, there is no-being, there is not yet beginning to be\nno-being, there is not yet beginning to be not yet beginning to be\nno-being. (Zhuangzi, sec. 2; on Tillich, Rodkey 2013:\n491\u2013493)\n\n\nThe fourth and fifth widely held views of the Dao are both about how\nnonbeing generates being, namely with wu wei\n(\u201cnon-action\u201d), and in stages. Andersen describes wu\nwei more fully: \u201cthe Way does not cause [things] to come\ninto being but provides a gap that allows things to emerge\u201d\n(2019: 131). To reveal wu wei, Daoist literature frequently\nuses images of the female and infants, e.g., twice over in\nDDJ 10, where wu wei is likened first to\n\u201ckeeping the role of the female\u201d who with no apparent\n(anyway) action naturally nurtures the fetus and then, to use\nAndersen\u2019s words, provides a gap to allow it to emerge in birth;\nand second to \u201cbeing as supple as a babe\u201d who is the\nepitome of the wu wei ruler since a baby does not do anything\nbut gets everyone else to act to please it (Zu\u0308rn in\nconversation; see also Erkes and Ho-Shang-Kung1945: 128).\n\nThe Dao is also taken to generate in stages, and actually in four of\nthem (DDJ 40, 42; Perkins 2019; Robson 2015: 1483; Wang 2012:\n48; etc.). There are various readings of the sequence, but one\nprominent view takes 0 as nonbeing, the Dao; 1 as unity, Being; 2 as\nduality,\n yinyang;[45]\n and 3 as multiplicity, namely heaven, earth and human beings. In a\nprescient recognition of how natural (heaven and earth) and social\n(human) constructions combine to make reality, 3 burgeons into 4,\ni.e., the 10,000 or myriad things that comprise the universe.\nCrucially, 4 returns to 0\u2014to use the feminine imagery, returns\nto the womb where everything is possible and everything\ndevelops\u2014and then the sequence repeats (Pregadio 2016 [2020:\nsec. 4], Wang 2012, 51 citing the Huainanzi). This\nworld-to-Dao-and-back cycle is reminiscent of the\noccasion-to-God-and-back cycle in process theology, though on a grand\nvs. momentary\n scale.[46]\n\nInterestingly, in general, Daoists read the sequence as strictly\ncyclical (so 4 returns to 0, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, \u2026) while\nRuists read it as an \u201cendless advance to novelty\u201d so that\nwe never step into the same cycle twice (i.e., 0, 1, \u2026, 0\u2032,\n1\u2032, \u2026, 0\u2033, 1\u2033, \u2026 etc.) (Song 2018:\n230\u2013232). Moreover, there is an open question whether the\nsequence is temporal or ontological (Song 2018: 225\u2013226) which\nis sometimes crystallized into a debate about whether 0 is temporally\n(and thus ontologically) prior to 1 or merely ontologically so. If the\nmove from 0 to 1 is temporal, then 0 happens before 1 and they are\nreally distinct; as Andersen argues:\n\n\nthe One is a product of the Way, not the Way itself\u2026 [because]\nidentity and stability as a thing in the world depends on being one.\n(Andersen 2019: 180)\n\n\nIf, on the other hand, 0 is only ontologically prior to 1, then\nnonbeing and being are always co-existing as two eternal aspects of\nwhat there is, with being still depending for its existence on\nnon-being like a burning eternal candle depends for its existence on\nits eternal flame. The ontological-only reading seems licensed by\nDDJ 1 which talks about \u201cthe nameless [who] was the\nbeginning of heaven and earth\u201d and \u201cthe named [who] was\nthe mother of the myriad creatures\u2026.these two are the same\nbut diverge in name as they issue forth\u201d (italics mine, for\nmore see Pregadio 2016 [2020: sec. 4.1])\u2014assuming that the\npassage implies that they diverge in name \u201conly\u201d. The\ndispute about how nonbeing and being relate is vexing enough that it\nis a relief, actually, when DDJ 81 throws up its hands and\nsays: \u201ctheir coexistence is a mystery\u201d!\n\nGrasping all this together\u2014that the Dao is the origin of all,\nimmanent in all, ziran, essentially nonbeing, generating\nforms of being by wu wei, generating stage by stage until we\nreach the roiling boil of being in the myriad things\u2014we are able\nto catch the last and perhaps deepest thought of all about the Dao:\nthat it is generative by nature, or as Neville says: \u201cnonbeing\nis simply fecund from the perspective of being\u201d (2008: 3). This\nidea hails back to the I Ching, which takes \u201cthe\nfoundation of the changes\u201d to be sheng sheng, literally\nmeaning \u201clife life\u201d or \u201cgenerating\ngenerating\u201d, sometimes glossed with the phrase shengsheng\nbuxi \u201cgenerating generating never\nceasing!\u201d\u2014held as the highest metaphysical principle by\nRuists (especially neo-Ruists) and not far from Spinoza\u2019s\nnatura naturans (Gao Heng 1998: 388 cited in Perkins 2019).\nThus, at the bottom of it all, there is just endless, unformed,\nspontaneous life stuff, which is generating increasingly formed\nspontaneous life stuff which, because it is shot through with the Dao,\nin turn generates even more, even further formed, spontaneous life\nstuff, and we are off and running to the 10,000 things, until, as yang\nwanes to yin, life life goes back to 0 (death death?), and all is\nstill until it waxes to yang again. In spite of the cycle that always\nsends it back to yin, it is fitting to call the Dao \u201clife\nlife\u201d because it always waxes to life again; the life force is\nirrepressible, no matter how many times it temporarily dies.\n\nThough the Daoist literature does not use these philosophical\ndistinctions much, and though occasionally it is read there as a\nmonism in passing, the standard model of the Dao just recounted is\nbest understood as an impersonal panentheism\u2014as are the\nclassical theisms and Bishop and Perszyk\u2019s model of God\n (Section 2.2).\n The Dao-world relation has the asymmetry that defines panentheism:\nall the forms of being at 1\u20134 (or at least 2\u20134, if Being\nis read as identical to the Dao) depend for their existence on the\nDao, but the Dao does not depend on them, or anything, for its\n existence.[47]\n In addition, if we take the theme of immanence in a full-throated way\nso that really there is nowhere down the line of the stages that the\nDao is not, then the Dao is both the efficient and material cause of\nthe universe, as we saw in the Bhakti Vedanta views. So the view of\nthe Dao traced here is close to the idea of Brahman as the builder of\na house out of Brahmanself, who eternally dwells in this eternal\nBrahman-house which depends on Brahman for its existence but not vice\nversa. But \u201cbuilder\u201d is too intentional for the Dao, and,\nat least on the temporal reading of the sequence, there is no eternal\nhouse and thus no eternal dwelling in it. So try this: think of the\nDao as an eternal seed for a house. The seed sprouts naturally in\nstages into a house filled with 10,000 things which depends on the\nseed but not vice versa, until the house dies back into the seed,\nwhich then lies dormant, pregnant with being, until it sprouts into\nbeing again, and so on, eternally.\n\nAfter all that has been said, the Dao is clearly metaphysically\nultimate in Schellenberg\u2019s sense: it is \u201cthe most\nfundamental fact about the nature of things\u201d (2016: 168). The\nDao is soteriologically ultimate as well, but, as with Brahman, it is\nnot clearly axiologically so. Regarding axiology, first, if we\nunderstand axiology as greatness along all the categories of being, we\ncan see immediately that the Dao, at least understood as 0, has\ngreatness along no category of being since it is not being at all (for\nmore see Kohn 2001:\n 18).[48]\n Moreover, if we narrow the idea of axiology just to the moral\ncategory of being, the Dao is still not axiologically ultimate. In\nmultiple texts, the Dao is taken to be neither good nor bad; it is\ntaken to be what is. Famous among them is DDJ, ch. 5\n(\u201cHeaven and earth are not kind, they treat the ten thousand\nbeings as straw dogs\u201d, see also chs. 18, 62). Interpreters take\nthese passages to mean that the Dao is either amoral\u2014as\nnonbeing, not the kind of thing that has moral interests in the first\nplace; or \u201cvalue-contrarian\u201d (Hansen 2020); or, to add a\nthought, perhaps \u201cananthropocentric\u201d, having moral\nconcerns that are not human-centered (see Mulgan 2015 and 2017). Wang\nBi\u2019s commentary on the straw dogs passage suggests that these\namoral or anti-moral moments spring from the Dao\u2019s and the\nsage\u2019s wu wei:\n\n\nThe one who is kind necessarily creates and erects, impacts and\ntransforms. He shows mercy and acts. If someone creates and erects,\nimpacts and transforms things, then these things lose their true\nreality. If he shows mercy and acts, then these things are not\nentirely there. (quoted in Andersen 2019: 130)\n\n\nIn other words, acting wu wei actually requires not being\nkind in the usual sense. But if Wang Bi is right, maybe there is an\naxiology after all to treating the myriad things like straw dogs:\nbeing kind in the traditional sense may not be being kind deeply since\nit destroys a thing\u2019s power to be itself.\n\nRegarding soteriology, it is agreed that a\u2014or even\nthe\u2014central goal of Daoist practices such as inner alchemy,\nt\u2019ai chi, etc. is to return to the Dao (fandao,\nhuandao, DDJ 16 and 40; Andersen 2019: 126), and\nspecifically to return to nonbeing, which is the Dao at its most\ncreative, powerful and sublime, on the crest of becoming being (Song\n2018: 234\u20135). If we can return to 0, we embody this power and\nsublimity in human form and, as Andersen says, also do our part to\nreturn the cosmos to the start for a new beginning (2019: 123). There\nare specific rituals Daoists do in communal contexts to return. In one\nof the important rites in Daoist liturgy called bugang\n(\u201cwalking along the guideline\u201d), a Daoist high priest\nwalks through the ritual space, with the audience making their own\noccasional movements too, to embody a complete motion of return with a\nsuccessful arrival back to 0 by the end of the rite, when\n\n\nthe forces that animated the universe at the beginning of time may\nonce again be channeled into the community on behalf of which the\nritual is performed. (2019: 118\u2013123)\n\n\nPractitioners outside of ritual contexts also try to return by\ninwardly cultivating the skill of acting as the Dao does when it\ngenerates being: with wu wei. Miller reminds us that wu\nwei is not some loose form of letting go, but is rather a\nspecific \u201cspiritual technology\u201d of intervening very gently\nat the right time, in the right place\u2014as Neville says, with\n\u201ca subtle infinitesimal dose\u201d when there is a rare\n\u201copening for spontaneity [in the otherwise hard-to-beat]\ninertial forces of the Dao\u201d (Miller 2003: 140; Neville 2008:\n47\u201351). Andersen\u2019s take on these efforts is haunting:\n\n\nAn accomplished Daoist resides in the gap between being and nonbeing.\nThe fundamental truth of Daoism is in this gap, in the Way and its\nmanifestation as true and real. (2019: 130)\n\n\nThis thought suggests an answer to the puzzle that surfaced about\nBrahman\u2014about why contact with a metaphysical ultimate that is\nnot axiologically so might still be fulfilling to us. At least for\nthose seeking awareness of Brahman and harmony with the Dao, our whole\ndesire looks like it is to be in the presence of what is true and real\n(Zhen), whether what is true and real is bad or good or\nneither or both. We are fans of unvarnished reality.\n3. Responses to the Diversity of Models of What is Ultimate\n\nAfter surveying these many models of Brahman, God, and the Dao, and\nrecognizing that they are just a small sample of the range of options\nfor modeling Brahman, God, and the Dao, which are in turn a small\nsample of the range of ultimates that could be modeled, one may\nwonder: What should one do with all this information?\n\nPeople respond in various ways after grasping the diversity of the\nmodels. Some abandon the models altogether, either exhausted by their\ncomplexity (embodied in Watt\u2019s wonderful phrase \u201cthe which\nthan which there is no whicher\u201d, 1972: 110), or convinced by\ntheir number and inconsistency that some models logically must be\nmaking a mistake, and it will be very hard to tell which ones. In\nother words, one response to the diversity is to decide more deeply\nthat the nature of what is ultimate is indeed beyond us, if there is\nanything ultimate at all, so it is not worth thinking about it.\n\nIn sharp contrast, others actually embrace the diversity of models as\npart of the path to understanding what is ultimate. The comparative\ntheologians, for example, study novel models in order to carry fresh\ninsights from them back to their own tradition and re-see their own\nmodels more deeply (see Clooney 2010 for an introduction and, e.g.,\nFeldmeier 2019 for the method applied to Buddhist and Christian models\nof the ultimate). An emerging movement, Theology Without Walls (TWW),\ndraws on the models to understand the nature of a globally shared\nultimate, one to which all the models may be intending to refer,\nreading the body of models as data and their number and\ninconsistencies as an interpretive challenge instead of a deal breaker\n(see, e.g., Martin 2020). Ramakrishna offers one such interpretation\nin the TWW spirit: he decides there is no need to choose between the\nmodels because each is a finite start on the \u201cinfinite paths to\nan infinite reality\u201d (see\n Section 2.1)\u2014each\n is news about an ultimate whose nature is so full that we actually\nneed all the models to help us see it. Both TWW and Ramakrishna will\nhave to explain how it is possible for many or all the models to\ndeliver news of what is ultimate given their inconsistency, e.g., by\nrelying on perspectivalism, a phenomenal/noumenal distinction, the\nmodels\u2019 incommensurability, etc. (see Ruhmkorff 2013 for a\nsurvey of options).\n\nOthers fall somewhere between abandoning and embracing the plurality\nof models by recommending that we hold the models loosely somehow,\nthat we attenuate our commitment to them. Kierkegaard for instance\ntells us to move our focus from the content of our model to our\norientation to what we are attempting to model: it is better to pray\nto a false God truly than to a true God falsely (paraphrase of 1846,\nPart Two, Chapter II).[49] \n Similarly, J.R. Hustwit cautions us to\n\u201cbalance engagement with non-attachment\u201d to models to\navoid ego-reinforcement and more (2013: 1003\u20131007)\u2014not far\nperhaps from Zhuangzi\u2019s and Tillich\u2019s semper\nnegativa of holding and letting go model after model, a view\nwhich converts the pile of models into grist for the mill of a\nspiritual practice. For his part, Schellenberg suggests that instead\nof having faith in a specific model of, e.g., Brahman, God or the Dao,\nwe do better to have it in the more general thing (res) that\nunderlies them all\u2014the axiological, soteriological, and\nmetaphysical ultimate which has been the organizing principle of this\nentry. One advantage of reading ultimacy in Schellenberg\u2019s way\nis that the general ultimate is more likely to exist than any of the\nparticular ultimates it covers, since it exists if any of them\n do.[50]\n A second advantage is that Schellenberg\u2019s general ultimate is\nby design the core, the overlooked \u201cheart\u201d of the many\nmodels\u2014the same thing that the particular models it covers are\nabout, just at a higher level of description. So faith in\nSchellenberg\u2019s ultimate permits a \u201cfaith without\ndetails\u201d (2009: ch. 2) in many of the world\u2019s religions\nand philosophies at once.\n\nFor those who, after this long journey through the landscape of models\nand now these responses to them, still hope to discover which model is\nphilosophically the best of them all, know that Wildman (2017) has a\nplan for \u201cthink[ing] our way through the morass\u201d (2017:\nviii). In brief:\n\nidentify the models worth your time;\nplace them in a \u201creverent competition\u201d that scores\nthem on \u201ccomparative criteria\u201d (2017: viii\u2013ix, ff.),\nthen\nadopt the winner, at least provisionally, since the entire inquiry\nis \u201cfallibilist\u201d (2017: 161 and elsewhere).\n\n\nWildman demonstrates his plan by following it himself (2017).\nInterestingly, he frames his options for step 1 in terms of\n\u201centire systems of thought\u201d comprised of combinations of\nmodels of what is ultimate (which he calls \u201cU types\u201d) plus\n\u201contological cosmologies\u201d (\u201cC types\u201d)\u2014an\nidea which may really do a better job of identifying our choices than\nthe models per se do, given their fuller capture of an entire\nworldview. His U types include agential models on which the ultimate\nis personal, ground of being models on which it is impersonal, and\n\u201csubordinate deity\u201d models such as process theology on\nwhich it is \u201cdisjoint:\u201d one or more personal deities\noperate in an impersonal ultimacy (2017: 13, 165, 182). His C types\ninclude supernaturalism, which involves disembodied agency;\nnaturalism, which does not; and monism. Combining the U and C types\nproduces nine U + C views, and to live out step 1 of his plan, he\nchooses his top three to place in competition: supernaturalist\ntheistic personalism (God as a personal perfect being), naturalist\nground of being (think, e.g., the panentheistic impersonal Dao), and\nWhitehead\u2019s or Hartshorne\u2019s process theism. For step (2),\nhe then subjects these three views to his comparative criteria, which\ninclude coherence, ability to handle the problems of evil and the One\nand the Many, fit with the sciences, and most importantly\nnon-anthropomorphism, his main criterion since he takes\nanthropomorphism to result from misapplying human cognitive structures\nthat were naturally selected for mere survival purposes to ideas of\nultimacy (2017: 217).\n\nWhen Wildman ran his competitors against these criteria, the\nnaturalist ground of being system won. But it is obviously up to each\nof us interested in such a project to run our own competitions on the\nmodels we take to be worth our time, with comparative criteria we\nthink make a model truth-conducive, in order to light on the most\nphilosophically satisfying model of what is ultimate that we can. That\nmodel would be the one to then subject to the best arguments for and\nagainst the existence of God and other ultimates, to discover in a\nfully researched and now clarified way, whether there is anything\nultimate.",
