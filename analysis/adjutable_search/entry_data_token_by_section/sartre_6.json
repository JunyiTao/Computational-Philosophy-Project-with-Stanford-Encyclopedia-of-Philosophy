Existential Psychoanalysis and the Fundamental Project\n\nSartre\u2019s radical criticism of Freud\u2019s theory of the\nunconscious is not his last word on psychoanalysis. In the last\nchapters of Being and Nothingness, Sartre presents his own\nconception of an existential psychoanalysis, drawing on some insights\nfrom his attempt to account for Emperor Wilhelm II as a\n\u201chuman-reality\u201d in the 14th notebook from his\nWar Diaries (Sartre 1983b [1984]). This existential version\nof psychoanalysis is claimed to be compatible with Sartre\u2019s\nrejection of the unconscious, and is expected to achieve a\n\u201cpsychoanalysis of consciousness\u201d (Moati 2020: 219),\nallowing us to understand one\u2019s existence in light of their\nfundamental free choice of themselves.\n\nThe very idea of a psychoanalysis oriented towards the study of\nconsciousness rather than the unconscious seems paradoxical\u2014a\nparadox increased by Sartre\u2019s efforts to highlight the\nfundamental differences that oppose his own version of psychoanalysis\nto Freud\u2019s. Sartre contends that Freud\u2019s\n\u201cempirical\u201d psychoanalysis \n\n\nis based on the hypothesis of the existence of an unconscious psyche,\nwhich on principle escapes the intuition of the subject. \n\n\nBy contrast, Sartre\u2019s own existential psychoanalysis aims to\nremain faithful to one of the earliest claims of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology: that all psychic acts are \u201ccoextensive with\nconsciousness\u201d (Sartre 1943 [1956: 570]). For Sartre, however,\nthe basic motivation for rejecting Freud\u2019s hypothesis is less an\ninheritance of Brentano\u2019s descriptive psychology (as was the\ncase for Husserl) than a consequence of Sartre\u2019s fundamental\ncritique of determinism, applied to the naturalist presuppositions of\nempirical psychoanalysis and the particular kind of determinism that\nit involves. In agreement with Freud, Sartre holds that psychic life\nremains inevitably \u201copaque\u201d and at least somewhat\nimpenetrable to us. He also stresses that the philosophical\nunderstanding of human reality requires a method for investigating the\nmeaning of psychic facts. But Sartre denies that the methods\nand causal laws of the natural sciences are of any help in that\nrespect. The human psyche cannot be fully analysed and\nexplained as a mere result of external constraints acting\nlike physical forces or natural causes. The for-itself, being always\nwhat it is not and not what it is, remains free whatever the external\nand social constraints. Sartre is consequently bound to reject any\nemphasis on the causal impact of the past upon the present, which he\nargues is the basic methodological framework of empirical\npsychoanalysis. That does not mean that past psychic or physical facts\nhave no impact on one\u2019s existence whatsoever. Rather, Sartre\ncontends that the impact of past events is determined in relation to\none\u2019s present choice, and understood as the consequence of the\npower invested in this free choice. As he puts it: \n\n\nSince the force of compulsion in my past is borrowed from my free,\nreflecting choice and from the very power which this choice has given\nitself, it is impossible to determine a priori the compelling power of\na past. (Sartre 1943 [1956: 503])\n\n\nPast events bear no other meaning than the one given by a subject, in\nagreement with the free project that orients his or her existence\ntowards the future. Conversely, determinist explanations that construe\none\u2019s present as a mere consequence of the past proceed from a\nkind of self-delusion that operates by concealing one\u2019s free\nproject, and thus contributes to the obliteration of responsibility.\nSartre hence seeks to redefine the scope of psychoanalysis: rather\nthan a proper explanation of human behaviour that relies on the\nidentification of the laws of its causation, psychoanalysis consists\nin understanding the meaning of our conducts in light of one\u2019s\nproject of existence and free choice. One might wonder, then, why we\nneed any such psychoanalysis, if the existential project that\nconstitutes its object is freely chosen by the subject. Sartre\naddresses this objection in Being and Nothingness, claiming\nthat \n\n\nif the fundamental project is fully experienced by the subject and\nhence wholly conscious, that certainly does not mean that it must by\nthe same token be known by him; quite the contrary. (Sartre 1943\n[1956: 570])\n\n\nWhat Freud calls the unconscious must be redescribed as the\nparadoxical entanglement of a \u201ctotal absence of knowledge\u201d\ncombined with a \u201ctrue understanding\u201d (r\u00e9elle\ncomprehension) of oneself (1972, Sit. IX: 111). The\nlegitimacy of Sartre\u2019s existential psychoanalysis of\nconsciousness lies in its ability to unveil the original project\naccording to which one chooses (more or less obscurely) to develop the\nfundamental orientations of their existence. According to Sartre,\nanalysing a human subject and understanding the meaning that orients\ntheir existence as a whole requires that we grasp the specific kind of\nunity that lies behind their various attitudes and conducts. This\nunity can only appear once we discover the synthetic principle of\nunification or \u201ctotalization\u201d (totalisation) that\ncommands the whole of their behaviours. Sartre understands this\ntotalization as an an-going process that covers the entire course of\none\u2019s existence, a process which is constantly reassumed so as\nto integrate the new developments of this existence. For this reason,\nthis never ending process of totalization cannot be fully\nself-conscious or the object of reflective self-knowledge. The\nsynthetic principle that makes this totalization possible is\nidentified by Sartre in terms of fundamental choice: existential\npsychoanalysis describes human subjects as synthetic totalities in\nwhich every attitude, conduct, or behaviour finds its meaning in\nrelation to the unity of a primary choice, which all of the\nsubject\u2019s behaviour expresses in its own way.\n\nAll human behaviour can thus be described as a secondary\nparticularisation of a fundamental project which expresses the\nsubject\u2019s free choice, and conditions the intelligibility of\ntheir actions. On the basis of his diagnosis of Baudelaire\u2019s\nexistential project, for instance, Sartre goes as far as to claim that\nhe is \u201cprepared to wager that he preferred meats cooked in\nsauces to grills, preserves to fresh vegetables\u201d (Sartre 1947a\n[1967: 113]). Sartre legitimates such a daring statement by showing\nits logical connection to Baudelaire\u2019s irresistible hatred for\nnature, from which his gastronomic preferences must derive, and which\nSartre identifies as the expression of the initial free choice of\nhimself that commands the whole of the French po\u00e8te\nmaudit\u2019s existence. In Sartre\u2019s words: \n\n\nHe chose to exist for himself as he was for others. He wanted his\nfreedom to appear to himself like a \u201cnature\u201d; and he\nwanted this \u201cnature\u201d which others discovered in him to\nappear to them like the very emanation of his freedom. From that point\neverything becomes clear. [\u2026] We should look in vain for a\nsingle circumstance for which he was not fully and consciously\nresponsible. Every event was a reflection of that indecomposable\ntotality which he was from the first to the last day of his life\n(Sartre 1947a [1967: 191\u2013192]).\n\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s choice of himself both accounts for the\nsubject\u2019s freedom (insofar as it has been freely accepted as the\nsubject\u2019s own project of existence) and exerts a constraint on\nparticular behaviours and attitudes towards the world, so that he is\nbound to act and behave in a way that must be compatible with that\nchoice. Although absolutely free, such an initial choice takes the\nshape and the meaning of an inescapable and relentless\ndestiny\u2014a destiny in which one\u2019s sense of freedom\nand their inability to act in any other way than they actually did\ncome to merge perfectly: \u201cthe free choice which a man makes of\nhimself is completely identified with what is called his\ndestiny\u201d (Sartre 1947a [1967: 192]).\n\nIn the years following the publication of Being and\nNothingness, Sartre refines this original conception of\nexistential psychoanalysis. He applies it methodically to the\nbiographical analysis of a series of major French writers (Baudelaire\nfirst, then Mallarm\u00e9, Jean Gen\u00eat, Flaubert, and himself\nin Words), warning against the dangers of all kinds of\ndeterminist interpretations, from the constitution of psychological\ntypes to materialist explanations inherited from Marxian historical\nanalyses. Sartre\u2019s analyses become more subtle over time, as he\nsubstitutes fine-grained descriptions of the concrete constraints that\nframe and shape the limits of human lives to the strongly metaphysical\ntheses on freedom that he was first tempted to apply indistinctly to\neach of these writers. Accordingly, existential psychoanalysis plays a\ncentral role in the development of Sartre\u2019s thought from the\nearly 40s up to his last published work on Flaubert. It allows him to\nunify and articulate two fundamental threads of his philosophical\nthinking: his ontological analysis of the absolute freedom of the\nfor-itself in Being and Nothingness; and his later attempt to\ntake into consideration the social, historical and political factors\nthat are inevitably involved in the determination of one\u2019s free\nchoice of their own existence. Already in his War Diaries\nfrom 1940, the method of analysis of \u201chuman reality\u201d\narises from Sartre\u2019s attempt to understand rather than\nexplain (according to Dilthey\u2019s famous distinction) Emperor\nWilhelm II\u2019s historical situation and its relation to the\naspects of his personal life that express his specific way of\nbeing-in-the-world (Sartre 1983b [1984: 308\u2013309]). The\napplication of his method to the specific cases of these French\nwriters allowed him to refine the ahistorical descriptions of his\nearlier work, by bringing the analysis of the subject\u2019s freedom\nback to the material/historical conditions (both internal and\nexternal) of constitution of their particular modes of existing.\n\nSartre\u2019s inquiries into existential psychoanalysis also\nanticipate and intersect with his philosophical investigations on\nhistorical anthropology. The progressive-regressive method presented\nin Search for a Method and Critique of Dialectical\nReason (Sartre 1960a [1976]) was first sketched and experimented\nthrough Sartre\u2019s essays in existential psychoanalysis.\nSartre\u2019s detailed analyses of Flaubert\u2019s biography in\nThe Family Idiot can be read as synthesising the\nhermeneutical methodology theorised in Search for A Method\nand the conception of the freedom involved in one\u2019s initial\nchoice of themselves that arose from Being and Nothingness.\nMoving discretely away from an all-too metaphysical doctrine of\nabsolute freedom, Sartre goes back to the most concrete details of\nFlaubert\u2019s material conditions of existence in order to account\nfor the specific way in which Flaubert made himself able, through the\nwriting of his novels, to overcome his painful situation as a\n\u201cfrustrated and jealous younger brother\u201d and\n\u201cunloved child\u201d thanks to a totalizing project that made\nhim \u201cthe author of Madame Bovary\u201d (Sartre\n1971\u201372 [1987, vol. 2: 7]). If Flaubert\u2019s novel and\nmasterpiece is consequently understood and described as the final\nobjectivation of Gustave\u2019s fundamental project, Sartre is now\ncareful to point out the economic, historic and social conditions\nwithin which this project only finds its full intelligibility.\nSartre\u2019s psychoanalytic method is then expected to reveal,\nbeyond what society has made of Flaubert, what he himself could make\nof what society has made of him. In order to fly away from the painful\nreality of his unbearable familial situation, the young Gustave\nchooses irreality over reality, and chooses it freely, though\nachingly. From that moment on, his dedication to literature commits\nhim to a fictional world that he couldn\u2019t but choose to elect as\nthe realm of his genius.\n",
