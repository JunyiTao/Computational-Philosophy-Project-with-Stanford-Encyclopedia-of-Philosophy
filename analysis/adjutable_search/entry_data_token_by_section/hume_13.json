    "main_text": "The Idea of Necessary Connection || Necessary Connection: Constructive Phase\n6.2 Necessary Connection: Constructive Phase\n\nSince we\u2019ve canvassed the leading contenders for the source of\nour idea of necessary connection and found them wanting, it might\nseem as if we have no such idea, but that would be too hasty.\nIn our discussion of causal inference, we saw that when we find that\none kind of event is constantly conjoined with another, we begin to\nexpect the one to occur when the other does. We suppose there\u2019s\nsome connection between them, and don\u2019t hesitate to call the\nfirst, the cause, and the second, the effect. We\nalso saw that there\u2019s nothing different in the repetition of\nconstantly conjoined cases from the exactly similar single case,\nexcept that after we\u2019ve experienced their constant\nconjunction, habit determines us to expect the effect when the cause\noccurs.\n\nHume concludes that it is just this felt determination of the\nmind\u2014our awareness of this customary transition from one\nassociated object to another\u2014that is the source of our idea of\nnecessary connection. When we say that one object is necessarily\nconnected with another, we really mean that the objects have acquired\nan associative connection in our thought that gives rise to this\ninference.\n\nHaving located the missing ingredient, Hume is ready to offer a\ndefinition of cause. In fact, he gives us two. The first,\n\n\nA cause is an object, followed by another, where all the objects\nsimilar to the first are followed by objects similar to the\nsecond,\n\n\ngives the relevant external impressions, while the\nsecond,\n\n\nA cause is an object followed by another, and whose appearance always\nconveys the thought to the other,\n\n\ncaptures the internal impression\u2014our awareness of being\ndetermined by custom to move from cause to effect. Both are\ndefinitions on Hume\u2019s account, but his \u201cjust\ndefinition\u201d of our idea of cause is the conjunction of the two\n(EHU 7.2.29/76\u201377). Only together do they capture all\nthe relevant impressions involved.\n\nHume locates the source of the idea of necessary connection in\nus, not in the objects themselves or even in our ideas of those\nobjects we regard as causes and effects. In doing so, he completely\nchanges the course of the causation debate, reversing what everyone\nelse thought about the idea of necessary connection. Subsequent\ndiscussions of causation must confront the challenges Hume poses for\ntraditional, more metaphysical, ways of looking at our idea of\ncausation.\n\nHume\u2019s treatment of our idea of causation is his flagship\nillustration of how his method works and the revolutionary results it\ncan achieve. He goes on to apply both his method, and its concrete\nresults, to other prominent debates in the modern period, including\nprobable inference, testimony for miracles, free will, and intelligent\ndesign.\n",
