They argue that current practices do not involve the\nmorally troubling characteristics of their historical predecessors.\nFirst, reprogenetic technologies and practices\nare individual in nature rather than\nstate-sponsored. The intended benefit of any reprogenetic intervention\nis individual/private welfare (that of the child-to-be or of the\nfamily), rather than the welfare of the state. Second, they are\npremised on individual liberty, the freedom of\nparents to choose according to their own values and conceptions of the\ngood life. The state does not mandate contraception, sterilization,\nprenatal testing, abortion, or any other form of eugenic intervention\n(note: there are potential exceptions in which judges or states have\noffered long-term contraception such as Norplant as a condition of\nprobation related to a criminal offense or for the continued provision\nof welfare, see e.g., Dresser 1996). Rather, it allows individuals to\nchoose among a range of alternatives. Third, recognizing that\nindividual parents will often desire different things for their\noffspring, current reprogenetic technologies and practices\npresume value pluralism. This means allowing others to\nchoose in ways that we ourselves would not, in the interest of\npreserving a liberal society that is neutral about conceptions of the\ngood. The aim of a liberal eugenic program is\nto expand reproductive choices for individuals, in\ncontrast to the historical eugenic programs that clearly cut off\nreproductive options for many.\n\n\nOf course, this does not mean that no limits can\nbe imposed on people\u2019s choices. Even liberal eugenics advocates\ntypically presume that some restrictions would need\nto be in place to ensure that prospective parents could not act in ways\nclearly contrary to the interests of their future children, or in ways\nthat seem clearly vicious. As will be discussed below, disagreements\nexist about how and where those limits should be set.\n\n\nFinally, advocates of current reprogenetic\ntechnologies and practices highlight the difference between the kind\nand quality of the science underlying past and current reproductive\npolicies. Past eugenic programs relied on views of race, intelligence,\nand genetics that were, from our current perspective, \u201chopelessly\nwrong\u201d (Agar 2004: 7), while reprogenetic technologies are\ngrounded on purportedly sound scientific theories and evidence.\n\n\nFor advocates of liberal eugenics, the fundamental\ndifferences between the old and the new practices are reasons to reject\nclaims about the moral wrongness of current reprogenetic technologies.\nIn their view, what current and past eugenic practices share is the aim\nof improving our offspring, and arguably that is a morally worthy goal.\n  \n",
