Identity, Distinction, and Individuation\n\nSharpe\u2019s theory of identity and distinction combines in an\noriginal way those of Duns Scotus, Wyclif, and Penbygull.\n\nPenbygull (De universalibus, pp. 189\u201390) had (1)\ndistinguished between the notion of non-identity and that of\ndifference (or distinction); (2) denied that the notion of difference\nimplies that of non-identity; (3) affirmed that the two notions of\ndifference and real identity are logically compatible, thus admitting\nthat (3.1) there are degrees in distinction, and (3.2) that the\ndegrees of distinction between two things can be read as the inverse\nmeasure of their (partial) identity; and (4) suggested the following\ndefinitions for these three notions, that is non-identity, difference\n(or distinction), and (absolute) identity: (4.1) an entity a\nis non-identical with an entity b if and only if there is not\nany form F such that F is present in the same way in\na and b; (4.2) an entity a differs from an\nentity b if and only if there is at least a form F\nsuch that F is directly present in a but not in\nb, or vice versa; (4.3) an entity a is\nabsolutely identical with an entity b if and only if for any\nform F, it is the case that F is present in a\nif and only if it is present in the same way in b (see the\nentry on William Penbygull, \u00a73).\n\nLike Penbygull, Sharpe considers identity and distinction (or\ndifference) as the two possible inverse measures of the coincidence of\nthe metaphysical components of two given entities (QsU., p.\n92). Moreover, he speaks of formal and real (or essential) identity,\nand formal and real (or essential) distinction (or difference), and\nstates that formal identity is stronger than real (or essential)\nidentity, since the former entails the latter, while, on the contrary,\nreal difference is stronger than formal distinction, since the latter\nis entailed by the former (ibid., pp. 91\u201392).\n\nFinally, he admits degrees in formal distinction, as he recognizes two\ndifferent types, the first of which comes very close to that proposed\nby Scotus in his Ordinatio, while the second is drawn from\nWyclif\u2019s Tractatus de universalibus (ch. 4, pp.\n90\u201392). The first type of formal distinction holds among things\nsuch as the intellective faculties of the soul, whereas the second\nholds between such things as the essence of the soul and its\nintellective faculties and a species and its individuals (Quaestio\nsuper libros De anima, q. 2, fol. 236r-v).\n\nThe two different sets of conditions for the formal distinction can be\nformalized as follows:\n\ntwo entities x and y are formally distinct if\nand only if (i) both of them are constitutive elements of the same\nreality, but (ii) neither of them can exist by itself, or (iii) is\npart of the definite description of the other.\ntwo entities x and y are formally distinct if\nand only if (i) there is at least one z such that z\nis predicated of x and not of y, or vice\nversa, but (ii) x and y are really identical,\nas one is directly predicated of the other qua its main\nintrinsic metaphysical component.\n\n\nAccordingly, real identity, which is presupposed by the formal\ndistinction, has to be defined in these terms (QsU, p.\n98):\n\na is really identical with b if and only if both are\nconstitutive elements, or material parts, of the same reality, or one\nof them is directly predicated of the other qua its superior\nin the categorial line (that is, qua its main intrinsic\nmetaphysical component).\n\n\nAs a result, Sharpe\u2019s world consists of finite beings (that is,\n\u201cthings\u201d like men, horses, stones etc.), really existing\noutside the mind, made up of an individual substance and a host of\nformal entities (common substantial natures and accidental forms, both\nuniversal and singular) existing in it and through it, since none of\nthese formal entities can exist by themselves. They are real only\ninsofar as they constitute individual substances or are present in\nindividual substances qua their properties. Specific\nsubstantial natures (or essences) can be conceived from two points of\nview: intensionally (in abstracto) and extensionally (in\nconcreto). Viewed intensionally, specific substantial natures are\nnothing but the set of essential properties that individual substances\nare to instantiate, but considered without any reference to such\ninstantiations. Viewed extensionally, specific substantial natures are\nthose same forms conceived of as instantiated by at least one singular\nsubstance. For instance, human nature considered intensionally is\nhumanity (humanitas), extensionally the universal-man\n(homo in communi). Humanity is properly a form, or more\naccurately, the essential principle of a substantial form, that is,\nsomething existentially incomplete and dependent; the universal-man is\nthis same form considered according to its own mode of being, and\ntherefore as a sort of existentially autonomous and independent entity\n(ibid., p 102). Consequently, like Wyclif, Sharpe holds that\na formal universal actually exists outside the mind if at least one\nindividual instantiates it, so that without individuals, common\nnatures (or essences) are not really universals (ibid., pp.\n105\u201306). This means that the relationship between common natures\nand singulars is ultimately based on individuation, since no actual\nuniversality and no instantiation is possible without individuation.\nOn this subject Sharpe seems to accept the essentials of\nAquinas\u2019 doctrine, since he affirms that (i) the universal-man\nis compounded of both common matter and form and that (ii) matter as\naffected by dimensive quantity and other accidental properties\n(materia quanta et accidentibus substrata) is the very\nprinciple of individuation, since it causes the passage from the level\nof universals to that of singulars (ibid., pp. 137\u201339).\nThus, according to Sharpe, explaining individuation means explaining\nhow a multiplicity of individuals can be obtained from a single\nspecific nature, the problem at issue being the dialectical\ndevelopment from one to many and not the passage from abstract to\nconcrete.\n\nSharpe\u2019s world counts many types of entities: universal and\nindividual substances and accidents (like homo in communi and\nSocrates, and like the general form of whiteness and this particular\nform of whiteness), universal abstract substantial essences (like\nhumanity), universal and individual substantial forms (like the human\nsoul in general and the soul of Socrates), general and individual\ndifferences (like the universal-rationality and the rationality proper\nto Socrates) \u2013 each one characterized by its own mode of being.\nThis world is certainly very complex, but its complexity is exceeded\nby complexity in language. Sharpe denies that there is a close\ncorrespondence between language and the world, as he believes that our\nthought is caused by the world, and our language by our thought, and\nthe relation between causes and effects is a relation of one to\nmany.\n",
