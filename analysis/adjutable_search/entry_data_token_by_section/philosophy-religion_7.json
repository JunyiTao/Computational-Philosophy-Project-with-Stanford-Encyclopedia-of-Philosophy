    "main_text": "Religion and Science\n4. Religion and Science\n\nThe relationship between religion and science has been an important\ntopic in twentieth century philosophy of religion and it seems highly\nimportant today. \n\nThis section begins by considering the National Academy of Sciences\nand Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine)\nstatement on the relationship between science and religion:\n\n\nScience and religion are based on different aspects of human\nexperience. In science, explanations must be based on evidence drawn\nfrom examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or\nexperiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to\nmodification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith,\nin contrast, does not depend only on empirical evidence, is not\nnecessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and\ntypically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are\nnot a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by\nscience. In this sense, science and religion are separate and address\naspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to pit\nscience and religion against each other create controversy where none\nneeds to exist. (NASIM 2008: 12)\n\n\nThis view of science and religion seems promising on many fronts. If\nthe above statement on science and religion is accepted, then it seems\nto insure there is minimal conflict between two dynamic domains of\nwhat the Academies refer to as \u201chuman experience\u201d. The\nNational Academies do seem to be correct in implying that the key\nelements of many religions do not admit of direct scientific\ninvestigations nor rest \u201conly on empirical evidence\u201d.\nNeither God nor Allah nor Brahman (the divine as conceived of in\nJudaism, Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism) is a physical or material\nobject or process. It seems, then, that the divine or the sacred and\nmany other elements in world religions (meditation, prayer, sin and\nforgiveness, deliverance from craving) can only be indirectly\ninvestigated scientifically. So, a neurologist can produce detailed\nstudies of the brains of monks and nuns when they pray and meditate,\nand there can be comparative studies of the health of those who\npractice a religion and those who do not, but it is very hard to\nconceive of how to scientifically measure God or Allah or Brahman or\nthe Dao, heaven, and so on. Despite the initial plausibility of the\nAcademies stance, however, it may be problematic.\n\nFirst, a minor (and controversial) critical point in response to the\nAcademies: The statement makes use of the terms \u201csupernatural\nforces or entities\u201d that \u201care not part of nature\u201d.\nThe term \u201csupernatural\u201d is not the standard term used to\nrefer only to God or the divine, probably (in part) because in English\nthe term \u201csupernatural\u201d refers not just to God or the\ndivine, but also to poltergeists, ghosts, devils, witches, mediums,\noracles, and so on. The later are a panoply of what is commonly\nthought of as preposterous superstition. (The similarity of the terms\nsupernatural and superstitious may not be an\naccident.) The standard philosophical term to reference God in the\nEnglish language, from the seventeenth century onward, is\ntheism (from the Greek theos for god/God). So,\nrather than the statement refer to \u201csupernatural forces or\nentities\u201d, a more charitable phrase might refer to how many\nworld religions are theistic or involve some sacred reality that is\nnot directly, empirically measurable. \n\nMoving beyond this minor point about terminology, religious beliefs\nhave traditionally and today been thought of as subject to evidence.\nEvidence for religious beliefs have included appeal to the contingency\nof the cosmos and principles of explanation, the ostensibly purposive\nnature of the cosmos, the emergence of consciousness, and so on.\nEvidence against religious belief have included appeal to the evident,\nquantity of evil in the cosmos, the success of the natural sciences,\nand so on. \n\nOne reason, however, for supporting the Academies notion that religion\nand science do not overlap is the fact that in modern science there\nhas been a bracketing of reference to minds and the mental. That is,\nthe sciences have been concerned with a mind-independent physical\nworld, whereas in religion this is chiefly a domain concerned with\nmind (feelings, emotions, thoughts, ideas, and so on), created minds\nand (in the case of some religions) the mind of God. The science of\nKepler, Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton was carried out with an\nexplicit study of the world without appeal to anything involving what\ntoday would be referred to as the psychological, the mind or the\nmental. So, Newton\u2019s laws of motion about the attraction and\nrepulsion of material objects make no mention of how love or desire or\nemotional need might be required to explain the motion of two material\nbodies to embrace romantically. The bracketing of mind from the\nphysical sciences was not a sign of early scientists having any doubts\nabout the existence, power and importance of minds. That is, from\nKepler through Newton and on to the early twentieth century,\nscientists themselves did not doubt the causal significance of minds;\nthey simply did not include minds (their own or the minds of others)\namong the data of what they were studying. But interestingly, each of\nthe early modern scientists believed that what they were studying was\nin some fashion made possible by the whole of the natural world\n(terrestrial and celestial) being created and sustained in existence\nby a Divine Mind, an all good, necessarily existing Creator. They had\nan overall or comprehensive worldview according to which science\nitself was reasonable and made sense. Scientists have to have a kind\nof faith or trust in their methods and that the cosmos is so ordered\nthat their methods are effective and reliable. The earliest modern\nscientists thought such faith (in what Einstein refers to as\n\u201cthe rationality and intelligibility of the world\u201d (Cain\n2015: 42, quoting a 1929 statement in Einstein 1954 [1973: 262]) was\nreasonable because of their belief in the existence of God (Cain\n2015).\n\nWhether there is sufficient evidence for or against some religious\nconception of the cosmos will be addressed in\n section 4.\n Let us contrast briefly, however, two very different views on whether\ncontemporary science has undermined religious belief.\n\nAccording to Steven Pinker, science has shown the beliefs of many\nreligions to be false.\n\n\nTo begin with, the findings of science entail that the belief systems\nof all the world\u2019s traditional religions and\ncultures\u2014their theories of the origins of life, humans, and\nsocieties\u2014are factually mistaken. We know, but our ancestors did\nnot, that humans belong to a single species of African primate that\ndeveloped agriculture, government, and writing late in its history. We\nknow that our species is a tiny twig of a genealogical tree that\nembraces all living things and that emerged from prebiotic chemicals\nalmost four billion years ago.\u2026 We know that the laws governing\nthe physical world (including accidents, disease, and other\nmisfortunes) have no goals that pertain to human well-being. There is\nno such thing as fate, providence, karma, spells, curses, augury,\ndivine retribution, or answered prayer\u2014though the discrepancy\nbetween the laws of probability and the workings of cognition may\nexplain why people think there is. (Pinker 2013)\n\n\nFollowing up on Pinker, it should be noted that it would not be\nscientifically acceptable today to appeal to miracles or to direct\nacts of God. Any supposed miracle would (to many, if not all\nscientists) be a kind of defeat and to welcome an unacceptable\nmystery. This is why some philosophers of science propose that the\nsciences are methodologically atheistic. That is, while\nscience itself does not pass judgment on whether God exists (even\nthough some philosophers of science do), appealing to God\u2019s\nexistence forms no part of their scientific theories and\ninvestigations.\n\nThere is some reason to think that Pinker\u2019s case may be\noverstated, however, and that it would be more fair to characterize\nthe sciences as methodologically agnostic (simply not taking\na view on the matter of whether or not God exists) rather than\natheistic (taking a position on the matter). First, Pinker\u2019s\nexamples of what science has shown to be wrong, seem unsubstantial. As\nMichael Ruse points out:\n\n\nThe arguments that are given for suggesting that science necessitates\natheism are not convincing. There is no question that many of the\nclaims of religion are no longer tenable in light of modern science.\nAdam and Eve, Noah\u2019s Flood, the sun stopping for Joshua, Jonah\nand the whale, and much more. But more sophisticated Christians know\nthat already. The thing is that these things are not all there is to\nreligions, and many would say that they are far from the central\nclaims of religion\u2014God existing and being creator and having a\nspecial place for humans and so forth. (Ruse 2014: 74\u201375)\n\n\nRuse goes on to note that religions address important concerns that go\nbeyond what is approachable only from the standpoint of the natural\nsciences.\n\n\nWhy is there something rather than nothing? What is the purpose of it\nall? And (somewhat more controversially) what are the basic\nfoundations of morality and what is sentience? Science takes the world\nas given Science sees no ultimate purpose to reality\u2026 I would\nsay that as science does not speak to these issues, I see no reason\nwhy the religious person should not offer answers. They cannot be\nscientific answers. They must be religious answers\u2014answers that\nwill involve a God or gods. There is something rather than nothing\nbecause a good God created them from love out of nothing. The purpose\nof it all is to find eternal bliss with the Creator. Morality is a\nfunction of God\u2019s will; it is doing what He wants us to do.\nSentience is that by which we realize that we are made in God\u2019s\nimage. We humans are not just any old kind of organism. This does not\nmean that the religious answers are beyond criticism, but they must be\nanswered on philosophical or theological grounds and not simply\nbecause they are not scientific. (2014: 76)\n\n\nThe debate over religion and science is ongoing (for promising work,\nsee Stenmark 2001, 2004).\n",
