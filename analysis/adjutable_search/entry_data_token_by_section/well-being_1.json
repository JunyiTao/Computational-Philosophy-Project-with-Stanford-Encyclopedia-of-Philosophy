    "main_text": "Moore\u2019s Challenge\n2. Moore\u2019s Challenge\n\nThere is something mysterious about the notion of \u2018good\nfor\u2019. Consider a possible world that contains only a single\nitem: a stunning Vermeer painting. Leave aside any doubts you might\nhave about whether paintings can be good in a world without viewers,\nand accept for the sake of argument that this painting has aesthetic\nvalue in that world. It seems intuitively plausible to claim that the\nvalue of this world is constituted solely by the aesthetic value of\nthe painting. But now consider a world which contains one individual\nliving a life that is good for them. How are we to describe the\nrelationship between the value of this world, and the value of the\nlife lived in it for the individual? Are we to say that the world has\na value at all? How can it, if the only value it contains is\n\u2018good for\u2019 as opposed to just \u2018good\u2019? And yet\nwe surely do want to say that this world is better (\u2018more\ngood\u2019) than some other empty world. Well, should we say that the\nworld is good, and is so because of the good it contains\n\u2018for\u2019 the individual? This fails to capture the idea that\nthere is in fact nothing of value in this world except what is good\nfor the individual.\n\nThoughts such as these led G.E. Moore to object to the very idea of\n\u2018good for\u2019 (Moore 1903, pp. 98\u20139). Moore argued that\nthe idea of \u2018my own good\u2019, which he saw as equivalent to\nwhat is \u2018good for me\u2019, makes no sense. When I speak of,\nsay, pleasure as what is good for me, he claimed, I can mean only\neither that the pleasure I get is good, or that my getting it is good.\nNothing is added by saying that the pleasure constitutes my good, or\nis good for me.\n\nBut the distinctions I drew between different categories of value\nabove show that Moore\u2019s analysis of the claim that my own good\nconsists in pleasure is too narrow. Indeed Moore\u2019s argument\nrests on the very assumption that it seeks to prove: that only the\nnotion of \u2018good\u2019 is necessary to make all the evaluative\njudgements we might wish to make. The claim that it is good that I get\npleasure is, logically speaking, equivalent to the claim that the\nworld containing the single Vermeer is good. It is, so to speak,\n\u2018impersonal\u2019, and leaves out of account the special\nfeature of the value of well-being: that it is good for\nindividuals.\n\nOne way to respond both to Moore\u2019s challenge, and to the puzzles\nabove, is to try, when appropriate, to do without the notion of\n\u2018good\u2019 (see Kraut 2011) and make do with \u2018good\nfor\u2019, alongside the separate and non-evaluative notion of\nreasons for action. Thus, the world containing the single individual\nwith a life worth living, might be said to contain nothing good\nper se, but a life that is good for that individual. And this\nfact may give us a reason to bring about such a world, given the\nopportunity.\n",
