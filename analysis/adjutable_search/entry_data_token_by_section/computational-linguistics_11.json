    "main_text": "Semantic interpretation || Mapping syntactic trees to logical forms\n4.1 Mapping syntactic trees to logical forms\n\nFor the next few paragraphs, we shall take semantic interpretation\nto refer to the process of deriving meaning representations from a word\nstream, taking for granted the operation of a prior or concurrent\nparsing phase. In other words, we are mapping syntactic trees to\nlogical forms (or whatever our meaning representation may be). Thus,\nunlike interpretation in the sense of assigning external denotations to\nsymbols, this is a form of \u201csyntactic semantics\u201d (Rapaport 1995).\nIn the heyday of the proceduralist paradigm, semantic interpretation\nwas typically accomplished with sets of rules that matched patterns to\nparts of syntactic trees and added to or otherwise modified the\nsemantic representations of input sentences. The completed\nrepresentations might either express facts to be remembered, or might\nthemselves be executable commands, such as formal queries to a database\nor high-level instructions placing one block on another in a robot's\n(simulated or real) world.\nWhen it became clear in the early 1980s, however, that syntactic\ntrees could be mapped to semantic representations by using\ncompositional semantic rules associated with phrase structure rules in\none-to-one fashion, this approach became broadly favored over pure\nproceduralist ones. In our earlier discussion in section 3.1) of\nmeaning representations within logicist frameworks, we already\nforeshadowed the essentials of logical form computation. There we saw\nsample interpretive rules for a small number of phrase structure rules\nand vocabulary. The semantic rules, such as NP\u2032\n= Det\u2032(N\u2032), clearly indicate how logical\nforms of lower-level constituents should be combined to yield those of\nhigher-level constituents. In the following figure, the sentence\n\n\u201cThetis loves a mortal\u201d has been interpreted by applying the\nearlier set of lexical and interpretive rules to the nodes of the\nphrase structure tree in a bottom-up, left-to-right sweep:\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Semantic interpretation of the parse tree of Figure 1\n\nThe interpretive rules are repeated at the tree nodes from \nsection 3.1, and the result of applying\nthe combinatory rules (with lambda-conversions where possible) are\nshown as well. As can be seen, the Montagovian treatment of NPs as\nsecond-order predicates leads to some complications, and these are\nexacerbated when we try to take account of quantifier scope\nambiguity. We mentioned Montague's use of multiple parses, the\nCooper-storage approach, and the unscoped-quantifier approach to this\nissue in section 3.1. In the\nunscoped-quantifier approach, with a relational interpretation of the\nverb, the respective interpretations of the leaf nodes (words) in\nFigure 4 would become Thetis,\n\u03bby\u03bbx(loves(x, y),\n\u03bbP <\u27e8\u2203P\u27e9>),\nand mortal, and S\u2032 at the root would\nbecome loves(Thetis,\n\u27e8\u2203mortal\u27e9), to be scoped uniquely to\n(\u2203x: mortal(x)\nloves(Thetis, x)). It is easy to see that multiple\nunscoped quantifiers will give rise to multiple permutations of\nquantifier order when the quantifiers are brought to the sentence\nlevel. Thus we will have multiple readings in sentences such as\n\u201cEvery man loves a certain woman\u201d.\n\n",
