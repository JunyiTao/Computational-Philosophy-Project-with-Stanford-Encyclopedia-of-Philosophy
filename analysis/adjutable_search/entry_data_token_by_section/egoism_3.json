    "main_text": "Rational Egoism\n4. Conclusion\n\nProspects for psychological egoism are dim. Even if some version\nescapes recent empirical arguments, there seems little reason, once\nthe traditional philosophical confusions have been noted, for thinking\nit is true. At best it is a logical possibility, like some forms of\nscepticism.\n\nEthical egoists do best by defending rational egoism instead.\n\nRational egoism faces objections from arbitrariness, Nagel and\nRachels, Parfit, Ewing, and evolutionary debunking. These worries are\nnot decisive. Given this, and given the historical popularity of\nrational egoism, one might conclude that it must be taken seriously.\nBut there is at least reason to doubt the historical record. Some\nphilosophers stressed the connection between moral action and\nself-interest because they were concerned with motivation. It does not\nfollow that self-interest is for them a normative standard. And many\nphilosophers may have espoused rational egoism while thinking that God\nensured that acting morally maximized one\u2019s self-interest. (Some\nwere keen to stress that virtue must pay in order to give God a\nrole.) Once this belief is dropped, it is not so clear what they would\nhave said (Shaver 1999 ch. 4; see also Crisp 2019).\n",
