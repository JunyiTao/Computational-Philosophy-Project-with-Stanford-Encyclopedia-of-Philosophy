    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Analyticity and the A Priori\n1.2 Analyticity and the A Priori\n\nAccording to Kant\u2019s original formulation, in analytic judgments\nthe concept of the predicate is contained in the concept of the\nsubject (1781 [1998]: A6\u20137).\n (1),\n that all bachelors are unmarried, provides a good illustration. On\none view, being a bachelor is a complex concept that is composed of\nbeing unmarried as well as being an adult male. So the concept of a\nbachelor \u201ccontains\u201d the concept of being unmarried. Hence,\npart of thinking of someone as a bachelor is thinking of him as\nunmarried. Compare this with the synthetic proposition\n (7),\n that all bachelors are untidy. The concept of being a bachelor is not\npartly composed of the concept of being untidy. Thinking of someone as\nuntidy is not part of thinking of him as a bachelor. So being a\nbachelor does not \u201ccontain\u201d being untidy. A more\ncontemporary understanding holds that sentences are analytic just in\ncase they can be converted into logical truths by replacing terms with\nterms that have equivalent meanings (Frege 1884 [1980]). The more\ncontemporary understanding counts more propositions as analytic than\nKant\u2019s original formulation: for example, all logical truths\nwill be counted as analytic, as well as a sentence such as \u201cif\nthere is blizzard, then there will be snow.\u201d\n\nOne might be tempted to think that all and only propositions expressed\nby analytic sentences can have a priori justification, and\nthat propositions expressed by synthetic sentences can only have a\nposteriori justification. We should resist this temptation. A\nnumber of philosophers, beginning with Kant, have claimed that some\nsynthetic propositions can have a priori justification. As we\nwill discuss below, Kant thought that all moral propositions were\nsynthetic but could be established only by reason. Moreover, if one\nconsiders what is fundamental to the two distinctions, there is no\nobvious reason to assume they would perfectly coincide. The\nanalytic/synthetic distinction fundamentally concerns conceptual or\nmeaning relations, specifically, whether the subject of a proposition\ncontains the predicate or whether the proposition is equivalent to a\nlogical truth. The a priori/a posteriori distinction\nis fundamentally epistemic, being concerned with whether experience is\nrequired for justification. Two such fundamentally different\ndistinctions could coincide, but it is not immediately apparent that\nthey do; it would take considerable work to show that they do.\n\nFinally, we must at least mention Quine\u2019s (1951) important\nattack on the coherence of the analytic/synthetic distinction. He\nargued that there\u2019s no clear way of distinguishing between\nanalytic sentences and sentences that merely express very strongly\naccepted propositions. Many philosophers have found Quine\u2019s\nargument persuasive, but the concept of analyticity has not been\nabandoned by all philosophers, indeed a majority still accept it (see\nentry on\n the analytic/synthetic distinction).\n We will make use of the of the analytic/synthetic distinction in this\nentry.\n",
