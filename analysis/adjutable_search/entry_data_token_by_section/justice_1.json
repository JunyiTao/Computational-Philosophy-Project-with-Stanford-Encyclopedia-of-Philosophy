    "main_text": "Justice: Mapping the Concept || Justice and Individual Claims\n1.1 Justice and Individual Claims\n\nFirst, it shows that justice has to do with how individual people are\ntreated (\u2018to each his due\u2019). Issues of justice\narise in circumstances in which people can advance claims \u2013 to\nfreedom, opportunities, resources, and so forth \u2013 that are\npotentially conflicting, and we appeal to justice to resolve such\nconflicts by determining what each person is properly entitled to\nhave. In contrast, where people\u2019s interests converge, and the\ndecision to be taken is about the best way to pursue some common\npurpose \u2013 think of a government official having to decide how\nmuch food to stockpile as insurance against some future emergency\n\u2013 justice gives way to other values. In other cases, there may\nbe no reason to appeal to justice because resources are so plentiful\nthat we do not need to worry about allotting shares to individuals.\nHume pointed out that in a hypothetical state of abundance where\n\u2018every individual finds himself fully provided with whatever his\nmost voracious appetites can want\u2019, \u2018the cautious, jealous\nvirtue of justice would never once have been dreamed of\u2019 (Hume,\nAn Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals, pp.\n183\u20134). Hume also believed \u2013 and philosophical controversy\non this point persists until today \u2013 that justice has no\nplace in close personal relationships, such as the family, where (it\nis alleged) each identifies with the others\u2019 interests so\nstrongly that there is no need and no reason for anyone to make claims\nof personal entitlement. (See Sandel 1982 for a defence of this view;\nfor a critique, see Okin 1989. See also the entry on\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family).\n\nThat justice is a matter of how each separate person is treated\nappears to create problems for theories such as utilitarianism that\njudge actions and policies on the basis of their overall consequences\naggregated across people \u2013 assuming that these theories wish to\nincorporate rather than discard the idea of justice. In Section 4\nbelow we examine how utilitarians have attempted to respond to this\nchallenge.\n\nAlthough justice is centrally a matter of how individuals are treated,\nit is also possible to speak of justice for groups \u2013 for example\nwhen the state is allocating resources between different categories of\ncitizens. Here each group is being treated as though it were a\nseparate individual for purposes of the allocation.\n",
