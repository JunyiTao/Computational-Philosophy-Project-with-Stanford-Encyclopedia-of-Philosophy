    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nLucrezia Marinella was born in Venice in 1571, and lived there until\nher death in 1653. Her father, Giovanni Marinelli, was a physician,\nand the author of a number of medical treatises, two of which\nconcerned women. He encouraged her intellectual interests, and allowed\nher access to biological and medical works, as well as works of\nphilosophy (natural and moral) and literature. She was thus able to\nobtain a good education. Marinella composed works in a number of\ndifferent genres, including lyric and narrative poetry, and devotional\nliterature, but her skill as a philosophical polemicist demonstrated\ndirect knowledge of the classical literary tradition and training in\nrhetoric and dialectic, all of which were unusual among women at the\ntime (Panizza and Wood 2000, 65). Marinella\u2019s first published\nwork appeared in 1595; her most important work, the treatise entitled\nThe Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of\nMen (hereafter The Nobility) was published in Venice in\n1600, revised and expanded in 1601, and reprinted in 1620. She\ncontinued writing and publishing until her death.\n\nMarinella married another physician, Girolomo Vacca, relatively late\nin life. In the sixteenth century political and economic conditions in\nVenice, and their impact on marriage opportunities, gave women more\nliberty, which may have favored feminist polemics (see Cox 1995). In\nthat context, Marinella\u2019s late marriage may have afforded her\ngreater opportunities for education and a measure of independence.\nThere is some evidence that she was accepted as part of a group of\nintellectuals who formed the second Venetian academy, and that the\nacademy supported and encouraged the expression of her feminist ideas\n(Kolsky 2001, 976). Marinella was commissioned to write The\nNobility, either by Lucio Scarano, to whom it is dedicated (also\na physician, and a philosopher) or by its publisher, Giovanni Battista\nCiotti (Kolsky 2001, 975; Ross 2009, 291). It was intended as a\nresponse to a treatise by Giuseppe Passi, I donneschi\ndiffetti (The Defects of Women). The commission attests\nboth to the reputation Marinella enjoyed as an intellectual, and to\nthe support she received from a wider circle.\n\nIn the sixteenth century the Italian vernacular increasingly replaced\nLatin as the language appropriate to a broad range of topics and\ngenres (Panizza and Wood 2000, 65, 195), so Marinella was not\neccentric in her choice of the vernacular (her father also wrote in\nItalian, and had publicly urged others to do so). The choice did,\nnonetheless, mean that her treatise in defense of women was available\nto more people, especially women. In her own time she was renowned as\nlearned and eloquent, and she acquired a reputation as a rigorous\nscholar and a skillful philosopher; this was certainly in part due to\nthe merits of her published work, but the respect she\nenjoyed\u2014very unusual for a feminist\u2014may have had something\nto do with the seclusion of her life and a reputation for sexual\nmodesty.\n",
