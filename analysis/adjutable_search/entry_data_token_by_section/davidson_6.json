    "main_text": "Meaning and Truth || Tarski and \u2018Convention T\u2019\n3.2 Tarski and \u2018Convention T\u2019\n\nOne of the great advantages of this proposal is that it enables\nDavidson to connect his account of a theory of meaning with an already\nexisting approach to the theory of truth, namely that developed by\nAlfred Tarski (in his seminal work \u2018The Concept of Truth in\nFormalised Languages\u2019, first published in Polish in 1933 and in\nEnglish translation in 1956). Tarski\u2019s theory of truth was\noriginally intended, not as a general account of the nature of truth,\nbut rather as a way of defining the truth-predicate as it applies\nwithin a formal language. Tarski suggests that we arrive at a formal\ndefinition of the predicate \u2018is true\u2019 by providing, for\nevery sentence s in the object language, a matching sentence\np in the meta-language that is a translation of s\n(here, in his use of the idea of translational synonymy, Tarski relies\nupon the concept of meaning in order to get at a theory of truth\n\u2013 Davidson reverses this approach). The resulting\n\u2018T-sentences\u2019 will have the form \u2018s is true\nin language L if and only if p\u2019. That an\nadequate theory should indeed be capable of generating a T-sentence\nfor every sentence in the object-language is the essence of\nTarski\u2019s \u2018Convention T\u2019 \u2013 a requirement that\nclearly matches the holistic requirement Davidson also specifies for\nan adequate theory of meaning. And just as a Davidsonian theory of\nmeaning treats the meaning of whole sentences as dependent on the\ncomponents of those sentences, so a Tarskian theory of truth also\noperates recursively by means of the technical notion of\nsatisfaction \u2013 a notion that stands to open sentences\n(expressions containing unbound variables) as does truth to closed\nsentences (expressions that contain no variables other than bound\nvariables) \u2013 such that the satisfaction conditions of more\ncomplex sentences are seen to depend on the satisfaction conditions of\nsimpler sentences.\n\nThe formal structure that Tarski articulates in his\n\u2018semantic\u2019 account of truth is identical to that which\nDavidson explicates as the basis for a theory of meaning: a Tarskian\ntruth theory can generate, for every sentence of the object-language,\na T-sentence that specifies the meaning of each sentence in the sense\nof specifying the conditions under which it is true. What\nDavidson\u2019s work shows, then, is that meeting the requirement of\nTarski\u2019s Convention T can be seen as the basic requirement for\nan adequate theory of meaning.\n\nA Tarskian truth theory defines truth using a logical apparatus that\nrequires little more than the resources provided within first-order\nquantificational logic as supplemented by set theory. Moreover, it\nalso operates to deliver a definition of truth that is purely\n\u2018extensional\u2019, that is, it defines truth by specifying\njust those instances to which the truth-predicate properly applies\nwithout any reference to \u2018meanings\u2019,\n\u2018thoughts\u2019 or other \u2018intensional\u2019 entities.\nBoth these features represent important advantages for the Davidsonian\napproach (Davidson\u2019s rejection of determinate meanings as having\na significant role to play in a theory of meaning already involves a\ncommitment to an extensional approach to language). However, these\nfeatures also present certain problems. Davidson wishes to apply the\nTarskian model as the basis for a theory of meaning for natural\nlanguages, but such languages are far richer than the well-defined\nformal systems to which Tarski had directed his attention. In\nparticular natural languages contain features that seem to require\nresources beyond those of first-order logic or of any purely\nextensional analysis. Examples of such features include indirect or\nreported speech (\u2018Galileo said that the earth moves\u2019),\nadverbial expressions (\u2018Flora swam slowly\u2019 where\n\u2018slowly\u2019 modifies \u2018Flora swam\u2019) and\nnon-indicative sentences such as imperatives (\u2018Eat your\neggplant!\u2019). An important part of Davidson\u2019s work in the\nphilosophy of language has been to show how such apparently\nrecalcitrant features of natural language can indeed be analysed so as\nto make them amenable to a Tarskian treatment. In \u2018On Saying\nThat\u2019 (1968) and \u2018Quotation\u2019 (1979b) he addresses\nthe question of indirect speech; in \u2018Moods and\nPerformances\u2019 (1979a) he deals with non-indicative utterances;\nand in \u2018Adverbs of Action\u2019 (1985a) he takes up the problem\nof adverbial modification. As in Davidson\u2019s analysis of actions\nand events, the notion of logical form plays an important part in his\napproach here \u2013 the problem of how to apply a Tarskian truth\ntheory to natural language is shown to depend on providing an analysis\nof the underlying logical form of natural language expressions which\nrenders them in such a way that they fall under the scope of a purely\nextensional approach employing only minimal logical resources.\n\nThere is, however, another more general problem that affects\nDavidson\u2019s appropriation of Tarski. Whilst Tarski uses the\nnotion of sameness of meaning, through the notion of translation, as\nthe means to provide a definition of truth (one of the requirements of\nConvention T is that the sentence on the right-hand side of a Tarskian\nT-sentence be a translation of the sentence on the left), Davidson\naims to use truth to provide an account of meaning. But in that case,\nit seems that Davidson needs some other way to constrain the formation\nof T-sentences so as to ensure that they do indeed deliver correct\nspecifications of what sentences mean. This problem is readily\nillustrated by the question of how we are to rule out T-sentences of\nthe form \u201c\u2018Schnee ist weiss\u2019 is true if and only if\ngrass is green.\u201d Since the biconditional \u2018if and only\nif\u2019 ensures only that the sentence named on the left will have\nthe same truth value as the sentence on the right, so it would seem to\nallow us to make any substitution of sentences on the right so long as\ntheir truth value is identical to that on the left. In one respect\nthis problem is met by simply insisting on the way in which\nT-sentences must be seen as theorems generated by a theory of meaning\nthat is adequate to the language in question as a whole (see\n\u2018Truth and Meaning\u2019). Since the meaning of particular\nexpressions will not be independent of the meaning of other\nexpressions (in virtue of the commitment to compositionality the\nmeanings of all sentences must be generated on the same finite base),\nso a theory that generates problematic results in respect of one\nexpression can be expected to generate problematic results elsewhere,\nand, in particular, to also generate results that do not meet the\nrequirements of Convention T. This problem can also be seen, however,\nas closely related to another important point of difference between a\nTarskian truth theory and a Davidsonian theory of meaning: a theory of\nmeaning for a natural language must be an empirical theory (it is,\nindeed, a theory that ought to apply to actual linguistic behaviour)\nand as such it ought to be empirically verifiable. Satisfaction of the\nrequirement that a theory of meaning be adequate as an empirical\ntheory, and so that it be adequate to the actual behaviour of\nspeakers, will also ensure tighter constraints, if such are needed, on\nthe formation of T-sentences. Indeed, Davidson is not only quite\nexplicit in emphasising the empirical character of a theory of\nmeaning, but he also offers a detailed account that both explains how\nsuch a theory might be developed and specifies the nature of the\nevidence on which it must be based.\n",
