    "main_text": "Dualisms\n5. Overarching Themes\n\nThere are a couple of over-arching questions that are worth raising\nnow with a (brief) overview in place. The outline offered here\nsuggests that in a number of different ways feminists are keen to\n\u201cunmask\u201d or \u201cuncover\u201d or\n\u201cdemythologize\u201d certain aspects of our ordinary (and\nphilosophical) thinking. Where ordinarily we take ourselves to be\ndealing with an ontology of substances, natural things, intrinsic\nproperties, we\u2019re in fact dealing with an ontology of social\nthings, relations, and non-substantive (and often normative) kinds.\nBut what is the relationship between these sorts of\n\u201cunmasking\u201d projects and projects that count as part of\n\u201cmainstream\u201d philosophy, or more specifically,\n\u201cmainstream\u201d metaphysics? So much analytic metaphysics\nconsists in \u201creconstructions\u201d of our ordinary concepts; a\nsignificant amount of it is unabashedly \u201crevisionary\u201d. So\nalong those lines, feminist metaphysics would seem to fit right in.\nClearly feminist metaphysics differs from the mainstream in its\nsubject matter and background assumptions, in particular in its focus\non the possible value ladenness of our concepts, categories and\ntheories, and its attention to the potential harms of justificatory\nideologies. But are there more substantial differences? Is feminist\nmetaphysics just \u201cmainstream\u201d metaphysics directed at\ndifferent issues, or is there a deep difference? And if there is a\ndeep difference, what exactly is it? Barnes and Mikkola have recently\ncharged that certain prevalent conceptions of metaphysics in\nnon-feminist circles even rule out feminist metaphysics. The charge is\nthat prevalent conceptions of metaphysics in mainstream metaphysics\ntake metaphysics to be concerned with the basic structure of reality\nand what is \u201cfundamental\u201d, where it is assumed that social\nreality cannot be fundamental or basic (Barnes 2014, forthcoming;\nMikkola forthcoming). Jonathan Schaffer and Ted Sider have engaged\nwith these charges (Schaffer forthcoming; Sider forthcoming),\nattempting to show that their respective metametaphysical theories\nallow room for feminist metaphysics and metaphysics of the social more\ngenerally.\n",
