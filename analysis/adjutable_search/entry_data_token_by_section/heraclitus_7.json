    "main_text": "Knowledge\n5. Knowledge\n\nPlato held that for Heraclitus knowledge is made impossible by the\nflux of sensible objects. Yet Heraclitus does not repudiate knowledge\nor the wisdom that comes from a proper understanding of the world. To\nbe sure, he believes most people are not capable of wisdom;\nunderstanding is a rare and precious commodity, which even most\nreputed sages do not attain to (B28[a]). Yet wisdom is possible, and\nit is embodied in Heraclitus\u2019 message, for those who can discern\nit.\n\nHeraclitus seems to accept the evidence of the senses as in some way\nvaluable: \u201cThe things of which there is sight, hearing,\nexperience, I prefer\u201d (B55). Sight is the best of the senses:\n\u201cThe eyes are more accurate witnesses than the ears\u201d\n(B101a). Yet in contrast to those who view knowledge as an\naccumulation of information or wisdom as a collection of sayings, he\nrequires much more than sensation and memory:\n\nLearning many things does not teach understanding. Else it would have\ntaught Hesiod and Pythagoras, as well as Xenophanes and Hecataeus.\n(B40)\n\n\nIn this statement Heraclitus reviews the leading authorities of his\nday, living (the last three) and dead, dealing with religious and\nsecular knowledge, and finds them all wanting. They spend too much\neffort in collecting information and not enough in grasping its\nmeaning. \u201cWhat intelligence or understanding do they [the\npeople] have?\u201d asks Heraclitus. \u201cThey follow popular bards\nand treat the crowd as their instructor, not realizing that the many\nare base, while the few are noble\u201d (B104). He criticizes Hesiod\non specifics: \u201cThe teacher of the multitude is Hesiod; they\nbelieve he has the greatest knowledge\u2013who did not comprehend day\nand night: for they are one\u201d (B57). In his myths, Hesiod treats\nDay and Night as separate persons, taking turns traveling abroad,\nwhile one remains at home. But this fails to capture the\ninterconnectedness of day and night, and falsifies reality. Heraclitus\ncriticizes Homer, Pythagoras and Archilochus for their inadequacies.\n\n\nIn general, he holds that people do not learn what they should:\n\u201cMany do not understand such things as they encounter, nor do\nthey learn by their experience, but they think they do\u201d (B17).\nIndeed, they do not process the information they receive:\n\u201cHaving heard without comprehension they are like the deaf; this\nsaying bears witness to them: present they are absent\u201d (B34).\nHeraclitus explains: \u201cPoor witnesses for men are the eyes and\nears of those who have barbarian souls\u201d (B107). A barbarian was\na non-Greek; just as a foreigner hears Greek words without\nunderstanding their meaning, most people perceive without\nunderstanding the world around them. Sense perception is necessary for\nknowledge, but not sufficient; without the ability to decipher\ninformation from the senses, one cannot understand the world.\n\nWhat chance is there then to learn the secrets of the world?\nHeraclitus is not wholly pessimistic about human cognitive abilities:\n\u201cAll men have a share in self-knowledge and sound\nthinking\u201d (B116). What is needed is not simply more sense\nexperience or more information, but an improved way of comprehending\nthe message (logos) that the world offers. In this context\nhis curious method of expression begins to make sense. He presents his\nstatements in the form of puzzles, riddles, aper\u00e7us. Many of\nthem support two or more readings, and contain hidden insights. To\ncomprehend them the reader must grasp their complexity and then\ndiscover their unity. To read Heraclitus appropriately is to have a\nrich cognitive experience, as the philosopher hints in his\nintroduction (B1).\n\nHeraclitus often presents a simple concrete situation or image which\nhas implications for our understanding of the world: a river, a bow, a\nroad. He does not generally pronounce generalizations and deduce\nconsequences. Rather, his method can be seen as inductive: he offers\nan example which suggests general principles. Unlike most\nphilosophers, he challenges the right brain rather than the left. He\ndoes not teach in the conventional sense; he offers his readers\nmaterials for understanding and lets them educate themselves. He cites\nwith approval a model of religious instruction:\n\nThe Lord whose oracle is at Delphi neither reveals nor conceals, but\ngives a sign. (B93)\n\n\nThe riddling statements of the Delphic oracle do not provide\nstraightforward answers, but force people to interpret them. His\ntruths come to the attentive reader as discoveries resulting from the\nsolution of a puzzle.\n",
