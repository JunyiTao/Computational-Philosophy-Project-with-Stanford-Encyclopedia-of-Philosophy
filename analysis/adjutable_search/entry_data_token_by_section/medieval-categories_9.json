    "main_text": "Later Middle Ages || William of Ockham (b. ca. 1285, d. 1347)\n5.2 William of Ockham (b. ca. 1285, d. 1347)\n\n\nWilliam of Ockham goes well beyond Scotus in his\nrejection of any kind of isomorphism between words, concepts, and\nthings. Ockham is well known for what is usually called\n\u201cnominalism,\u201d that is, the view that universals or natures\ndo not have any ontological status outside the mind. Moreover, in\ncontrast to many fourteenth-century authors who posit ten categories,\nOckham argues that our experience leads us to posit only two\nextra-mental categories: substance and quality.\n\n\nI claim that even though (I) the moderns hold that in every category\nthere are many things ordered with respect to superiority and\ninferiority in such a way that, according to them, what is superior is\npredicated per se in the first mode and in the nominative case of each\ninferior \u2026 and even though (ii), in order to have such\npredication, they fashion abstract names from adverbs \u2026, and\neven though (iii) they claim that there are ten primarily distinct\n\u201clittle things\u201d that correspond in all cases to these\nabstract names, it nonetheless seems to me that the ancient\nphilosophers did not posit such \u201clittle things,\u201d nor did\nthey claim that it is always by this sort of predication that the\ncategories are predicated of what is contained in them. (Ockham 1991,\nV. q. 22, 471\u201372)\n\n\nThe \u201clittle things\u201d to which Ockham refers in this\npassage are what Scotus calls \u201ccommon natures,\u201d which\naccording to Scotus correspond to the different abstract predicates\nfound in each of the nine accidental categories. For Scotus, such terms\nas \u2018squareness,\u2019 \u2018horseness,\u2019 and\n\u2018fatherhood\u2019 signify distinct and abstract existing\nentities, a view Ockham rejects.\n\n\nFollowing the standard medieval understanding of the opening lines of\nAristotle's On Interpretation, Ockham holds that written and\nvocal words are conventional signs of mental concepts, which are in\nturn natural signs of things. To a certain extent, he also admits that\nwritten and vocal words correspond to mental concepts, so that, just\nas there are ten kinds of predication, i.e., ten kinds of vocal\nutterances (the ten categories), there are also ten kinds of concepts\ncorresponding to them (see Panaccio 1999, 55).  However, Ockham argues\nthat our natural experience gives us no reason to think that the terms\nwe use for the categories signify ten extra-mental entities. Rather,\nexperience supports the view that only individual substances and the\naccident of quality exist extramentally. Ockham uses many semantic\ndevices to make his point (ibid., 71). For example, whereas Scotus\nmight say that \u201cSocrates is a father because of\nfatherhood,\u201d Ockham would rather say that \u201cSocrates is a\nfather because he has generated a son\u201d (Ockham 1991, V. q. 22,\n472; Klima 1999, 136). In this way, instead of positing an abstract\nentity, viz., \u201cfatherhood,\u201d to account for why Socrates is\na father, Ockham gives the activity of Socrates as an individual\nsubstance as the reason why Socrates is a father. However, in other\ncontexts and for specifically theological reasons, particularly when\nit comes to the cases of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the\nEucharist, Ockham is willing to grant that relations are real. (see\nAdams 1987, 267, and Spade 1999, 104)\n\n\nOckham is equally clear concerning the discipline that studies\ncategories. Like Buridan, among others, he held that they are studied\nin grammar and logic, not in metaphysics. Aristotle's\nCategories is concerned with words that\nprimarily signify things, and only indirectly with\nthings. As Ockham puts it in his early Commentary on Aristotle's\ntext:\n\n\nThis is Boethius' intention, when he says: \u201cHe who deals\nwith words that signify, also, in some fashion or other, will deal with\nthings.\u201d For the thing and the signification of the thing are\njoined together. But this discussion which is about words is more\nprimary, whereas that which is framed with respect to the notion of\nthings, is secondary. That is, in the second place, he treats about\nthose things for which [the words] stand. And ignorance of\nAristotle's intention in this book leads many moderns astray,\n[the moderns] believing that he wants many utterances to be understood\nfor things, which really are to be understood of words\nalone\u2013\u2013and by way of analogy, for the intentions and\nconcepts in the soul. (Ockham 1978, q. 1)\n\n\nThe ten categories, then, are studied both in grammar and logic,\nalbeit in different ways, but not in metaphysics. They are studied to\nthe extent that they signify things, but we must not suppose that\nthere is any one-to-one correspondence between words and concepts on\nthe one hand and things on the other. There is generally a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between words and concepts, though even here this is\nnot always true.  For example, in his Summa logicae, he\nclaims that participles and adjectives are distinct parts of speech\naccording to grammar, even though they are not distinct according to\nlogic (Ockham 1974, SL 3). Nevertheless, for Ockham, there\nare ten categories of words and concepts, but the extra-mental things\nthat are signified by them are either individual substances or\nindividual qualities.\n\n\nOckham employs a number of distinctions in the exposition of his\naccount. One of these is particularly important for subsequent authors.\nThis is the distinction between \u201ccategory\u201d taken as one of\nthe ten highest genera (e.g., substance, quantity, quality, etc.) and\n\u201ccategory\u201d taken as the set of coordinated\npredicates contained in each of these genera. In the\nformer sense, the term \u2018category\u2019 refers to each of the ten\nhighest genera, whereas in the latter sense, the term refers to any set\nof predicates ordered to one another. The most famous example of the\nlatter is Porphyry's tree, which starts out with\n\u201csubstance\u201d at the top and includes in descending order\nsuch items as \u201ccorporeal,\u201d \u201cliving,\u201d\n\u201canimal,\u201d and \u201cman.\u201d In the Summa\nlogicae, Ockham presents the distinction as follows:\n\n\n\u2018[C]ategory\u2019 has two senses. In one sense, it is used to\nsignify the whole series of terms ordered according to greater and\nlesser generality. In the other sense, the word is used for the first\nand most general term in each such series. In the second sense of\n\u2018category,\u2019 every category is a simple term of first\nintention\u2026. inasmuch as it signifies things which are not signs.\n(Ockham 1974, SL 40) \n\n\nOckham's view does not go unchallenged.\nWalter Burley (ca. 1275\u20131344/5), for example, develops his mature\ndoctrine of categories in opposition to Ockham in his Commentary on\nthe Old Logic (Conti 1990) and influences such later medieval\nrealists as Robert Arlyngton (fl. 1390), John Sharpe (1360-1415),\nand John Wyclif (1324-1384).\n",
