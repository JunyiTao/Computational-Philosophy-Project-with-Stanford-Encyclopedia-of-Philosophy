    "main_text": "\n\n\nStudents of Plato and other ancient philosophers divide philosophy\ninto three parts: Ethics, Epistemology and Metaphysics. While generally\naccurate and certainly useful for pedagogical purposes, no rigid\nboundary separates the parts. Ethics, for example, concerns how one\nought to live and focuses on pleasure, virtue, and happiness. Since,\naccording to Plato (and Socrates), virtue and happiness require\nknowledge, e.g., knowledge of goods and evils, Plato's ethics is\ninseparable from his epistemology. Epistemology is, broadly speaking,\nthe study of what knowledge is and how one comes to have knowledge.\nAmong the many topics included in epistemology are logic, belief,\nperception, language, science, and knowledge. (\u2018Science\u2019\nderives from the Latin \u2018scientia\u2019, which in turn\ntranslates the Greek \u2018episteme\u2019, from which\nEnglish derives \u2018epistemology\u2019.) Integral to all of these\nnotions is that they (typically) are directed at something. Words refer\nto something; perception (aesthesis in Greek) involves\nperceptibles; knowledge requires a known. In this respect, epistemology\ncannot be investigated without regard to what there is.\n\n\nMetaphysics, or alternatively ontology, is that branch of philosophy\nwhose special concern is to answer the question \u2018What is\nthere?\u2019 These expressions derive from Aristotle, Plato's student.\nIn a collection of his works, the most detailed treatise on the general\ntopic of things that are comes after a treatise on natural things,\nta phusika (from which English derives\n\u2018physics\u2019). Since the Greek for \u2018after\u2019 is\nmeta, this treatise is titled \u2018Metaphysics\u2019. In\nthat work one finds the famous formula that (first) philosophy studies\nbeing\u2014the Greek for which is on\u2014qua being. Hence the\naccount of being is \u2018ontology\u2019\u2014the English suffix\n\u2018-ology\u2019 signifying \u2018study of\u2019: e.g., biology\nis the study of living things.\n\n\nMetaphysics, then, studies the ways in which anything that\nis can be said or thought to be. Leaving to sciences like biology or\nphysics or mathematics or psychology the task of addressing the special\nways in which physical things, or living things, or mathematical\nobjects, e.g., numbers, or souls (minds) come to have the peculiar\nqualities each, respectively, has, the subject-matter of metaphysics\nare principles common to everything. Perhaps the most general principle\nis: to be is to be something. Nothing just exists, we might say. This\nnotion implies that each entity/item/thing has at least some one\nfeature or quality or property. Keeping at a general level, we can\nprovisionally distinguish three factors involved when anything is\nwhatever it is: there is that which bears or has the property, often\ncalled the \u2018subject\u2019, e.g., Socrates, the number three, or\nmy soul; there is the property which is possessed; e.g., being thin,\nbeing odd, and being immortal; and there is the manner or way in which\nthe property is tied or connected to the subject. For instance, while\nSocrates may be accidentally thin, since he can change, that is, gain\nand lose weight, three cannot fail to be odd nor, if Plato is correct,\ncan the soul fail to be immortal. The metaphysician, then, considers\nphysical or material things as well as immaterial items such as souls,\ngod and numbers in order to study notions like property, subject,\nchange, being essentially or accidentally.\n",
