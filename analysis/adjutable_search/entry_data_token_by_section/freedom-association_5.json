    "main_text": "The Right to Exclude || Intimate Associations\n3.1 Intimate Associations\n\nAt some level, we must be able to exclude others from our\nassociations, especially our intimate associations: Families\nwouldn\u2019t be families if the competent members couldn\u2019t\nexercise some control over membership. Moreover, family members as\nindividuals would lack all manner of meaningful personal freedoms if\nthey could not control at least their own membership. Traditionally,\nand in many families today, not all competent family members enjoy\nequal power to determine membership. Patriarchs have long controlled\nwho is welcome within the family: for instance, casting out children\nwho failed to meet some standard of virtue. Denying other competent\nfamily members (equal) say over membership has far-reaching\nimplications. As much feminist literature confirms, to have even\nminimal control over their bodies and their lives, women need a right\nto exclude, where that includes the right to refuse a marriage\nproposal, the right to access contraception, the right to divorce, and\nindeed the right to choose not to spend private time with certain\npeople (Baylis and McLeod 2014). Arguably, both women and men also\nneed a positive right to reproductive assistance where that includes\nmeaningful rights to try to include new family members,\nnamely rights to try to bear children or to adopt children. Taking\nthese rights seriously means recognizing that they are all\nconcomitants of freedom of intimate association (Karst 1980; Mill\n1859).\nLimits to intimate exclusion\n\nA given family member\u2019s rights to exclude must, however, be\nchecked by other family members\u2019 rights to retain membership\nand, indeed, checked also by some non-members\u2019 rights to be\nsufficiently protected and cared for. First, parents have duties to\nensure that their children are adequately associatively-embedded,\nespecially if they\u2019re not going to be primary carers themselves.\nEven with the parents involved, there may be good reason to mitigate\nparents\u2019 \u201cmonopolies of care\u201d, by requiring\nstate-funded early-years childcare. Such mandatory childcare would\nreduce parents\u2019 abilities to control the terms of familial\nassociation, in effect obliging them to permit state intervention at\nthe level of the household (Gheaus 2018: 60).\n\nSecond, divorcing spouses cannot excuse themselves from all duties to\ntheir former partners, especially if that partner is caring for their\nchildren. There are, and should be, limits on the impact they can have\non other family members\u2019 associations with each other.\n\nThird, more contentiously, families might also have duties to look to\nthe associative needs of people who are bereft of close connection,\nfor example by fostering vulnerable children or housing refugees. In\ncrises situations such as the Blitz in Britain, many families living\noutside targeted areas were recruited to house evacuees, sometimes for\nthe duration of WWII. Given the urgency of the situation, these\nfamilies contributions are plausibly described in the language of\nduties and rights rather than that of\nsupererogation. Our \u201cobligatorily gregarious natures\ngive us basic needs to be with other people, especially when we are\nhighly dependent or vulnerable\u201d (Cacioppo & Patrick 2008:\n52). Put more strongly, our deep social needs identify a potential\nlimit both to our freedoms of association and dissociation and to our\ncontrol over the terms of our associations, to guarantee the goods of\nassociation to everyone when they need them (Liao 2015: ch. 3). A\nperson shunned by everyone when everyone exercises their right to\nexclude is denied these important goods (Brownlee 2016b). These basic\nneeds demand association with others, and this claim-right might\noverride others\u2019 permissions, claim-rights, and immunities to\nrefuse such association.\n\nTechnology or the market might provide a way for us to \u201chave our\ncake and eat it too\u201d, as they might offer us the means to\nnavigate simultaneously the often painful, boring, frustrating and\ndemanding labor of carrying out our associative duties and\nmaximizing our associative freedoms. For example, in a situation where\nrobots could be programmed to simulate, approximate or perhaps even\nsurpass in some ways, the kinds of reactions and behaviors typical of\nhuman beings, we can ask whether this could effectively replace the\nneed for humans to take on such work. In Japan, for instance, some\ncare homes have robots that can mimic human responses\u2014tilting\nheads to express sympathy, blinking to indicate\nreceptiveness\u2014which are being used to comfort lonely people, in\nlieu of their absent children or partners. In Japan again, busy adult\nchildren can hire actors to visit their aging parents, instructing the\nactors to pretend to be them. By doing so, both sides\u2014children\nand parents\u2014can perceive this as an effective means of\nnegotiating filial duties. Can such practices\u2014technological or\nmarket-based\u2014meet our basic associative needs while also\nmaximizing our associative choices, meaning that we get to spend time\nonly with those people with whom we really want to spend time? Or will\nsuch replacements inevitably fall short and, worse, eventually change\nthe meanings of what it means to care, such that we, in the words of\nSherry Turkle, come to expect more and more of technology and less and\nless of each other (Turkle 2011)? These thorny questions may become\neasier to answer as the relevant technologies and market initiatives\ncome into their own.\n",
