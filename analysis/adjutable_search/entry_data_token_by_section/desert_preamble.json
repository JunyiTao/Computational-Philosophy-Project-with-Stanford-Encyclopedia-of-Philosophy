    "main_text": "\n\nClaims about desert are familiar and frequent in ordinary\nnon-philosophical conversation. We say that a hard-working student who\nproduces work of high quality deserves a high grade; that a vicious\ncriminal deserves a harsh penalty; that someone who has suffered a\nseries of misfortunes deserves some good luck for a change. \n\nPhilosophers have made use of the concept of desert in several\ncontexts. In discussions of the nature of justice, several\nphilosophers have advocated versions of the idea that justice obtains\nwhen goods and evils are distributed according to desert. In\ndiscussions of the concept of intrinsic value, some philosophers have\nsuggested that happiness may be the greatest good but it has\noutstanding value only when enjoyed by someone who deserves it. In\ntheories about moral obligation, some consequentialists have defended\nthe idea that right acts lead to outcomes in which higher welfare is\npreferentially distributed to people who deserve it. In social and\npolitical philosophy (or philosophy of law) a number of philosophers\nhave appealed to the concept of desert when discussing the\njustification of penalties for violations of law. \n\nSo appeals to desert appear frequently in many contexts, in philosophy\nas well as in ordinary non-philosophical talk. Yet many questions\nremain about desert: how can it be distinguished from mere\nentitlement? What is its conceptual structure? What kinds of things\ncan be deserving? What kinds of things can be deserved? What kinds of\nproperties can serve as bases on which a deserver deserves a desert?\nHow can claims about desert be justified? \n",
