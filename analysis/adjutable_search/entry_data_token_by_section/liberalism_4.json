    "main_text": "The Debate Between the \u2018Old\u2019 and the \u2018New\u2019 || Classical Liberalism\n2.1 Classical Liberalism\n\nLiberal political theory, then, fractures over how to conceive of\nliberty. In practice, another crucial fault line concerns the moral\nstatus of private property and the market order. For classical\nliberals \u2014 \u2018old\u2019 liberals \u2014 liberty and\nprivate property are intimately related. From the eighteenth century\nto the present day, classical liberals have insisted that an economic\nsystem based on private property is uniquely consistent with\nindividual liberty, allowing each to live her life \u2014including\nemploying her labor and her capital \u2014 as she sees fit. Indeed,\nclassical liberals and libertarians have often asserted that in some\nway liberty and property are really the same thing; it has been\nargued, for example, that all rights, including liberty rights, are\nforms of property; others have maintained that property is itself a\nform of freedom (Gaus, 1994; Steiner, 1994). A market order based on\nprivate property is thus seen as an embodiment of freedom\n(Robbins, 1961: 104). Unless people are free to make contracts and\nsell their labour, save and invest their incomes as they see fit, and\nfree to launch enterprises as they raise the capital, they are not\nreally free.\n\nClassical liberals employ a second argument connecting liberty and\nprivate property. Rather than insisting that the freedom to obtain and\nemploy private property is simply one aspect of people\u2019s\nliberty, this second argument insists that private property\neffectively protects liberty, and no protection can be effective\nwithout private property. Here the idea is that the dispersion of\npower that results from a free market economy based on private\nproperty protects the liberty of subjects against encroachments by the\nstate. As F.A. Hayek argues, \u201cThere can be no freedom of press\nif the instruments of printing are under government control, no\nfreedom of assembly if the needed rooms are so controlled, no freedom\nof movement if the means of transport are a government monopoly\u201d\n(1978: 149).\n\nAlthough classical liberals agree on the fundamental importance of\nprivate property to a free society, the classical liberal tradition\nitself is a spectrum of views, from near-anarchist to those that\nattribute a significant role to the state in economic and social\npolicy (on this spectrum, see Mack and Gaus, 2004). At the libertarian\nend of the classical liberal spectrum are views of justified states as\nlegitimate monopolies that may with justice charge for essential\nrights-protection services: taxation is legitimate if necessary and\nsufficient for effective protection of liberty and property. Further\n\u2018leftward\u2019 we encounter classical liberal views that allow\ntaxation for public education in particular, and more generally for\npublic goods and social infrastructure. Moving yet further\n\u2018left\u2019, some classical liberal views allow for a modest\nsocial minimum.(e.g., Hayek, 1976: 87). Most nineteenth century\nclassical liberal economists endorsed a variety of state policies,\nencompassing not only the criminal law and enforcement of contracts,\nbut the licensing of professionals, health, safety and fire\nregulations, banking regulations, commercial infrastructure (roads,\nharbors and canals) and often encouraged unionization (Gaus, 1983b).\nAlthough classical liberalism today often is associated with\nlibertarianism, the broader classical liberal tradition was centrally\nconcerned with bettering the lot of the working class, women, blacks,\nimmigrants, and so on. The aim, as Bentham put it, was to make the\npoor richer, not the rich poorer (Bentham, 1952 [1795]: vol. 1, 226n).\nConsequently, classical liberals treat the leveling of wealth and\nincome as outside the purview of legitimate aims of government\ncoercion.\n",
