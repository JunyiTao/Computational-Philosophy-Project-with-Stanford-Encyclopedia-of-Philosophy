    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\nBorn on the island of Cherso, or Cres, off the coast of Dalmatia,\nin 1529, Francesco Patrizi began his initial scholarly training in his\nhome city, followed by studies in Venice and Ingolstadt, before\nenrolling at the University of Padua in 1547. Although he initially\nintended to study medicine, he quickly turned to the humanities,\nlearning Greek and beginning the systematic analysis of philosophical\ntexts which would come to be the major preoccupation of his\nprofessional life. He spent seven years at Padua working with an\noutstanding faculty in Aristotelian philosophy while engaging in\ndiscussions with thinkers devoted to the study of Plato and other\nalternative philosophical sources. He later travelled to several other\nItalian cities and moved to Cyprus, where he was able to strengthen\nhis knowledge of Greek and assemble a collection of Greek manuscripts\n(Muccillo 1993). Following two excursions to Spain, during which he\nsold a major portion of his Greek manuscripts to Philip II, he was\noffered an appointment to teach Platonic philosophy at the University\nof Ferrara in 1578, a position he held until invited by Cardinal\nIppolito Aldobrandini to accept a similar assignment at the University\nof Rome, the \u201cSapienza\u201d, in 1592. He spent the last years\nof his life as one of the very few philosophers teaching Platonism in\na university setting in late sixteenth-century Italy, passing away in\n1597 while still engaged in defending his controversial work,\n\u201cThe New Universal Philosophy\u201d (Nova de universis\nphilosophia), from the theological criticisms that had led it to\nbe condemned by the Congregation of the Index shortly after it\nappeared in print in 1591. Upon his death, his chair in Platonic\nphilosophy was awarded to the other major university teacher of\nPlatonism in Italy at the time, Patrizi's contemporary and\ncorrespondent, Jacopo Mazzoni (Kristeller 1964, 113-116; Muccillo\n1992).\nBased on the published and unpublished works he wrote during his\ncareer, it is clear that Patrizi's range of interests was quite\nbroad, reflecting both the artistic, historical and literary influence\nRenaissance humanism continued to enjoy in scholarly circles during\nthe sixteenth century as well as the emergence of a devotion to\npractical scientific and engineering issues on the part of many\nphilosophers. A brief survey of his works amply reveals the scope of\nhis concerns [see Bibliography]. Among his earliest publications was a\ncollection of works which appeared at Venice in 1553, including his\nutopian \u201cThe Happy City\u201d (La citt\u00e0\nfelice), a dialogue on honor (Il Barignano) and a\ndiscourse on the diversity of poetic inspirations (Discorso della\ndiversit\u00e0 de' furori poetici). He composed poetic works of\nhis own. In 1560 he published his ten dialogues on history and, two\nyears later, ten dialogues on rhetoric. He also engaged in exchanges\non literary subjects with some of the leading authors of his day.\nIt was not until 1571 that Patrizi put forward his first major\nphilosophical work in a more narrowly construed sense, when the first\npart of his \u201cPeripatetic Discussions\u201d (Discussiones\nperipateticae) appeared at Venice; a greatly expanded version\nwould be published at Basel ten years later. The Discussiones\nwould constitute one of Patrizi's most important contributions\nto Renaissance philosophy. It provided a thoroughgoing analysis and\ncritique of Aristotle's thought, which continued to be the most\ninfluential source in theological as well as secular philosophical\nsettings in the sixteenth century. In addition to taking on the\nleading philosophical tradition of his day, Patrizi's work would\nserve as the basis for his own development of an anti-Aristotelian\nphilosophy in the years ahead. [see section 2].\nBy actively seeking to compare Aristotle's philosophical\nviews with those of other ancient thinkers, the Discussiones\nearns Patrizi a place in the history of a major philosophical genre\nwhich has its roots in classical antiquity and which flourished again\nduring the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in large part due\nto the increased availability of translations and commentaries of the\nworks of Plato and other ancient sources. This\n\u2018Comparatio\u2019 tradition would not only attain popularity in\nprinted works but would provide an alternative model for teaching\nphilosophy and natural science in university settings, where\nPeripatetic views had long held the field. Unlike the\n\u2018Conciliatio\u2019 approach adopted by such thinkers as\nGiovanni Pico della Mirandola, which sought to reconcile the apparent\ndifferences between the teachings of Plato and Aristotle, authors like\nPatrizi and contemporaries such as Jacopo Mazzoni and Paolo Beni\nattempted to use a direct confrontation of the opposing views as a\nmethod for arriving at a position which was most defensible\nphilosophically. In his own major works Patrizi did not hesitate to\nemphasize his opposition to Aristotelianism and his preference for a\nPlatonic approach. [see section 3.]\nThe publication of the Discussiones did not by any means\nsignal an end to Patrizi's broader literary and historical\ninterests, however. In 1583 he published a major study on the ancient\nRoman army, based on his reading of Polybius, Livy and Dionysius of\nHalicarnassus, following it up a decade later with a two-volume\ncomparison of ancient Roman military tactics and strategies with those\nof his own day, probably in attempt to encourage an improvement in\nItalian military standing. He translated works of Platonic thinkers\nsuch as Proclus, the pseudo-John Philoponus, and various tracts in\nmagical philosophy, now recognized as spurious, which were associated\nwith the ancient Egyptian sage Hermes Trismegistus and his\nfollowers. His attention to the latter sources placed him in the\nmiddle of the growing debate on the authenticity and philosophical\nmerit, if any, of the \u201cancient theology\u201d and the practice\nof spiritual and demonic magic by such contemporary thinkers as the\nunfortunate Giordano Bruno. [see section 4].\nShortly before being called to Rome by Pope Clement VIII to teach\nPlatonic philosophy at the University of Rome, the Sapienza, Patrizi\npublished the first edition of his philosophical masterpiece, the\nNova de universis philosophia (Ferrara, 1591; an edition with\nsignificant variants was printed at Venice with a spurious retrodating\nof 1593). In sum, it brings together many of the major themes that had\ndominated his philosophical career: the opposition to Aristotle and\nthe Peripatetic philosophical method, the admiration for Platonism as\na philosophical alternative, together with the incorporation of\ninsights derived from other ancient and modern sources to form a novel\nsystem that Patrizi was proud to call his own and seek to have\nestablished as a new basis for philosophical instruction in the\nuniversities of Europe. Not surprisingly, opposition to his goals was\ndetermined, with critics on both the theological and philosophical\nsides voicing their concerns. In spite of his having produced a series\nof emendations in response to criticisms by theological and\nphilosophical critics, his work was condemned by the Congregation of\nthe Index of prohibited Books \u201cuntil corrected\u201d in\n1592. He was to spend the last years of his life trying to defend his\nviews, which in some cases hindsight shows to have pointed toward some\nof the ways in which science and philosophy would move in the\nSeventeenth Century and beyond.
