    "main_text": "Publishing and Professional Africana Philosophy\n11. Publishing and Professional Africana Philosophy\n\n\nLeonard Harris has been a pioneer of published works on African\nAmerican philosophy and continues to be a major contributor in many\nways, not least as an editor of collections that have made widely\navailable important texts that otherwise would not have gotten the\nattention of researchers and scholars concerned with the\nphilosophizings of Black folks. Of particular note, his edited\ncollection The Philosophy of Alain Locke: Harlem Renaissance and\nBeyond (Harris 1989) provides ready access to philosophical\nessays from among Locke\u2019s more than three hundred published and\nunpublished essays and book reviews. And his\nPhilosophy Born of Struggle: Anthology of Afro-American Philosophy\nfrom 1917 (Harris 1983) was for many years the only widely\navailable, somewhat historically organized collection of writings by\nAfrican American professional philosophers and other philosophizing\nBlack scholars. (An important earlier collection is Percy\nE. Johnston\u2019s Afro-American Philosophers. (Johnston\n1970)) More recently new collections devoted to African American\nPhilosophy have been organized and published by Tommy L. Lott (Lott\n2002); by Lott and John P. Pittman (Lott and Pittman 2003); and by\nJames A. Montmarquet and William H. Hardy (Montmarquet and Hardy\n2000).\n\n\nThis publishing is an important part of the story of Africana\nphilosophy, and helps to make and legitimate the case that persons\nAfrican and of African-descent, on the African continent and in the\nAfrican Diaspora in the Americas and elsewhere, are creators and\ncustodians of Africana philosophy. A number of publishers have\nrecognized and accepted these developments and, after substantial,\nlong-standing resistance and outright refusal by many to recognize\nhistoric writings by persons of African descent and contemporary\nscholarship by philosophers African and of African descent as proper\ninstances of philosophical work, have made a priority of adding works\nof Africana philosophy to their lists of published works.\n\n\nOf particular publishing significance is the continuing, regular\nappearance of issues of Philosophia Africana: Analysis of\nPhilosophy and Issues in Africa and the Black Diaspora, a journal\nfor which Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze of DePaul University was founding\neditor until his unexpected death in 2007. Philosophia\nAfricana remains the only scholarly journal in the United States\nthat is devoted to Africana philosophy, though increasingly other\nphilosophy journals are accepting and publishing writings that fall\nwithin the subfield. None, however, have been as generous as\nPhilosophical Forum, which, under the editorial directorship\nof Max Wartofsky (deceased), devoted two entire special issues to\nexplorations of philosophical matters of particular concern to Black\nphilosophers. Noteworthy, too, has been the continuing midwifing of New\nYork-based publisher and scholar Alfred Prettyman, who has devoted\ntime, energy, and other resources to nurturing The Society for the\nStudy of Africana philosophy (originally the New York Society for the\nStudy of Black Philosophy), an organization of philosophers and other\nengaged thinkers of African descent, and persons not of African\ndescent, who come together in his home to present and discuss ideas and\nworks on the way to publication or recently published. For a brief\nperiod Prettyman was editor and publisher of the now dormant The\nJournal of the New York Society for the Study of Black\nPhilosophy.\n\n\nThe professional recognition and legitimation of Africana philosophy\ngenerally, of African, African American, and Afro-Caribbean philosophy\nas sub-foci of the field; the notable success enjoyed by a slowly\nincreasing number of persons African and of African descent in being\nhired, retained, and promoted by departments and programs in\ninstitutions of higher education; more publishing opportunities; a\ncontinuing vigorous schedule of regular conferences and conference\nsessions devoted to explorations of matters pertinent to the\nfield\u2014all of these continue to be crucial to building and\nenhancing the literature-base of the field and to facilitating\nteaching, research, scholarship, and other collegial engagements and\npractices that are essential to forming and sustaining nurturing\ndiscursive communities devoted to engaging philosophizing productive of\nAfricana philosophy. And the enterprise is being enriched by the\nparticipation and contributions of an increasing number of persons,\nstudents and professionals, who are neither African nor of African\ndescent.\n",
