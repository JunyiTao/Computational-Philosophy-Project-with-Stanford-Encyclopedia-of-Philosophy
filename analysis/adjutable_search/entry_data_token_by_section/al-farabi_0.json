    "main_text": "Enumeration of the Sciences\n1. Enumeration of the Sciences\n\nIn what follows we will underline important scholarly developments of\nthe last thirty years and add useful complements to these listings. In\norder to highlight these scholarly developments we will follow the\ntraditional order of the Aristotelian sciences that\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee himself offers in his Enumeration of\nthe sciences, \u2018Ihs\u00e2\u2019\nal-\u2018ul\u00fbm, one of his most famous texts, as its\nMedieval Latin versions had much influence in the West. There is no\nfull English translation of this text, but Amor Cherni (2015)\npublished an edition with French translation and commentaries.\nRecently, a new critical edition with German translation of one of the two\nMedieval Latin versions have come out: \u00dcber die\nWissenschaften (de scientiis) Dominicus Gundissalinus\u2019\nversion (2006). Alain Galonnier published a critical edition, French translation and study of the other Medieval latin version: Le De scientiis  Alfarabii de Gerard de Cremone (2016). Following this\ntraditional theoretical order makes much sense since we know very\nlittle about the chronological order of\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s works, even if there is some\nindication that The Opinions of the People of the Virtuous\nCity, also known as The Perfect State, and The\nPolitical Regime, also known as The Principles of the\nBeings, may be among his latest works. The paucity of serious\ninformation about the chronological order of\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s works makes it difficult to\ndetermine whether some inconsistencies and tensions between different\nworks result from an evolution in his thought, as Damien Janos claims (2019, pp. 166\u201370), or hint at a distinction\nbetween exoteric and esoteric treatises or simply arise from\nlimitations inherent to human nature that affect even the greatest\nphilosophers. As al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee understood philosophy as\nall-encompassing and attempted to present coherent views, some works\nstraddle several philosophical disciplines and so we will indicate\nwhen such is the case. Al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s knowledge\nof Aristotle\u2019s works is extensive, and even includes some of his\nzoological treatises.\n",
