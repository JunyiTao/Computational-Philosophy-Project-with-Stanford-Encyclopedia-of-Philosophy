    "main_text": "Extensions and alternatives to standard proof-theoretic semantics || 0 Substructural approaches\n4. Conclusion and outlook\n\nStandard proof-theoretic semantics has practically exclusively been\noccupied with logical constants. Logical constants play a central role\nin reasoning and inference, but are definitely not the exclusive, and\nperhaps not even the most typical sort of entities that can be defined\ninferentially. A framework is needed that deals with inferential\ndefinitions in a wider sense and covers both logical and extra-logical\ninferential definitions alike. The idea of definitional reflection\nwith respect to arbitrary definitional rules (see section\n 2.3.2)\n and also natural language applications (see secton\n 3.4)\n point in this direction, but farther reaching conceptions can be\nimagined. Furthermore, the concentration on harmony, inversion\nprinciples, definitional reflection and the like is somewhat\nmisleading, as it might suggest that proof-theoretic semantics\nconsists of only that. It should be emphasized that already when it\ncomes to arithmetic, stronger principles are needed in addition to\ninversion. However, in spite of these limitations, proof-theoretic\nsemantics has already gained very substantial achievements that can\ncompete with more widespread approaches to semantics.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor contributions on a variety of aspects of proof-theoretic semantics\nsee the reader edited by Piecha and Wehmeier (2023, open access).\n",
