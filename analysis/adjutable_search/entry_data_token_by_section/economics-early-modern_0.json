Schools of Economic Thought\n\nAdam Smith\u2019s An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the\nWealth of Nations (1776) is without question the single most\ninfluential tome, both for the early modern period and for the entire\nhistory of economics. Smith\u2019s analysis not only unpacked the\ncore features of money and markets, but also provided a dynamic\nanalysis of the \u201cprogress of opulence\u201d, sweeping across\nthe globe and reaching back to ancient times (see Rothschild & Sen\n2006). He covered the entire range of economics, from price theory to\npublic finance. Significantly\u2014and this may prove his greatest\ncontribution\u2014his first and only other book, The Theory of\nMoral Sentiments (1759), developed a moral psychology that served\nas the foundation for his economics and, arguably, for economics to\nthe present insofar as it still commits to the self-interest axiom\n(see Davis 2003; Schliesser 2017; Fleischacker 2013 [2020]).\nSmith\u2019s first book motivated the universal sympathetic regard\nthat binds us to one another, even to strangers, and it established a\nrestless desire for approbation and hence for wealth as the driving\nforce of human betterment. Finally, his essays on the history of\nscience served to elevate the epistemic standing of economics, and by\nthe first half of the nineteenth century the science of political\neconomy, as it came to be known, was widely esteemed (see Redman\n1997).\n\nSmith remains nonpareil, not only because of the breadth and depth of\nhis work, but also because he provided one of the most penetrating\nanalyses of human behavior to explain our economic condition. If\nHobbes offered a political solution to conflict and penury, Smith\ngrasped a century later that economic forces, the accumulation of\nwealth and the ever-expanding global trade, overrode the power of the\nmost ambitious of sovereigns. Recognition of the immense power of\nmarkets, both local and international, commenced in the seventeenth\ncentury, as a number of prominent twentieth-century economists came to\nrecognize. John Maynard Keynes paid tribute to the English\nMercantilists, John Locke, and William Petty; Friedrich Hayek honored\nthe insights of Bernard Mandeville and Richard Cantillon; Paul\nSamuelson admired Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay; and Milton Friedman praised\nJohn Law. All four\u2014Keynes, Hayek, Samuelson, and\nFriedman\u2014admired and wrote about David Hume\u2019s economics\n(see Schabas & Wennerlind 2020: Ch. 7).\n\nSmith owed a sizable debt to his immediate predecessors, above all to\nhis close friend Hume with whom he exchanged ideas for over\ntwenty-five years (see Harris 2015). There is a grain of truth to\nJoseph Schumpeter\u2019s harsh judgment that\n\n\nthe Wealth of Nations does not contain a single\nanalytic idea, principle, or method that was entirely new in\n1776. (Schumpeter 1954: 184)\n\n\nThis, however, is testament to the theoretical maturity of economics\nby the second half of the eighteenth century. The most robust verities\nof economics, even to this day, are to be found in the pre-Smithian\nliterature (see Hutchison 1988). The core elements of the theory of\nprices had been broached, its grounding in use-value and\nexchange-value, the appeal to the costs of labor and the imperative of\ncost-recovery, as well as the laws of supply and demand in various\nguises, including the concept of the price-elasticity of demand.\nPre-Smithian economists are renowned for contributions to monetary\ntheory, stipulating the form and function of money, the principles of\nbimetallism, debasement and devaluation, the quantity theory of money,\nthe specie-flow mechanism and the multiplier (see Murphy 2009; Arnon\n2010). Gresham\u2019s law, devised circa 1560, was extended from\ndomestic currencies to foreign exchange markets. Financial markets\nbecame increasingly sophisticated, with a wide array of equities,\nbonds, and discounted banknotes in circulation. The state issued\npublic debt in the form of bonds and Exchequer notes, and amassed\nsignificant funds through lotteries and annuities (see Neal 1990). In\nthe stock markets of Hamburg (1558), Amsterdam (1602), and London\n(1698), one could find short selling (windhandel),\nbond-equity swaps, and futures (see De Marchi & Harrison 1994). In\n1747, \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet is reputed to have devised and\nprofited from contracting a percentage of future tax revenues, a novel\ninstrument akin to a modern derivative (Bodanis 2006:\n217\u2013218).\n\nEconomists before Smith, such as Cantillon, Hume, James Steuart, and\nAnne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, discerned some of the key arguments for\nthe gains from trade and the dynamics of economic growth that stemmed\nfrom the division of labor, population growth, economies of scale and,\nabove all, capital accumulation (see Murphy 2009). Because of the\ngrowth of markets and factor mobility, eighteenth-century economists\nrecognized the regional manifestation of a uniform wage and profit\nrate, and thus made insights not only about the inverse relationship\nbetween profits and wages but also about the tendency of the profit\nrate to decline over time. Above all, they did what is essential to\nmost if not all philosophical thought\u2014drive a wedge between\nappearance and reality\u2014distinguishing prices from underlying\nvalues, and the nominal or money wage from the real wage, its\npurchasing power. Petty, Hume, and Smith firmly entrenched the central\ndistinction of the nominal and the real in economic discourse while\nalso grappling with efforts to measure inflation.\n\nAs a field of inquiry, economics was prodigious during the early\nmodern period. From the mid-sixteenth to the late eighteenth century,\nthe catalogue of French and English publications on economics exceeded\nfive thousand entries (see Massie 1760; Th\u00e9r\u00e9 1998;\nHoppit 2006). These took the form of books, short tracts, essays,\npamphlets, and dictionaries, as well as entries in periodicals such as\nthe Gentleman\u2019s Magazine or\n\u00c9ph\u00e9m\u00e9rides du citoyen.\n\nThere were at least a dozen distinct schools of economic thought in\nearly modern Europe (see Hutchison 1988). By far the largest and most\nlong-lived were the Cameralists, and their voluminous output is not\nincluded in the figure of five thousand given above. Cameralists were\nto be found across the Germanic, Scandinavian, and Italian\nprincipalities or republics for much of the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies. Kameralwissenschaft, or the economics of the\nchamber, was primarily a set of courses for young men as preparation\nfor government positions. They also studied philosophy, the\nmetaphysics of Christian Wolff for example, as well as botany,\nchemistry and metallurgy (see Tribe 1978; Wakefield 2009). Some of the\nleading Cameralists, notably Johann Joachim Becher, Joseph von\nSonnenfels, and Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi, advanced distinct\ndoctrines pertaining to autarky or public finance, vestiges of which\nendured in twentieth-century Fascism. Justi\u2019s last book,\nSystem des Finanzwesens (1766), synthesized much of the\nextant knowledge of Cameralism, specifically on fiscal policy. As a\ngroup, they concentrated on resource extraction\u2014mining and\nlogging\u2014as the means to enrichment and self-sufficiency, but\nthere were also schemes, particularly by the Swedish botanist and\nCameralist, Carl Linnaeus, to domesticate non-native plants as a means\nto reduce trade dependencies (see Koerner 1999).\n\nInnumerable writings on money, trade and commerce were posthumously\ngrouped by Adam Smith under the rubric of the \u201cMercantile\nSystem\u201d, or what eventually came to be known as Mercantilism.\nMany of the texts were polemical and self-serving, and endorsed Crown\nrights and monopolistic trade. Mercantilist writings sprang up across\nwestern Europe, particularly in seventeenth-century Sweden, Holland,\nand England (see Magnusson 1994; Stern & Wennerlind 2014). Among\nthese were important works by Gerard de Malynes (1622) and Edward\nMisselden (1623), each of whom made efforts to discover the underlying\nfactors for the economic depression of the 1620s (see Appleby 1978).\nThe two most influential English mercantilists, Thomas Mun (1664) and\nJohn Cary (1695) theorized about the gains from trade and its benefits\nfor national wealth and well-being, and were by no means crude\nbullionists (see Reinert 2011).\n\nOther schools were more localized and less enduring than the\nCameralists or Mercantilists. One of the first is the Salamanca school\nof mid-sixteenth-century Spain that included Luis de Molina,\nMart\u00edn de Azpilcueta, and Francisco Su\u00e1rez (see\nGrice-Hutchinson 1978). Another school drew inspiration from the\nnatural law theories of Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf, who had\naddressed the principles governing contractual obligations in general,\nand the complexities of property rights in particular (see Skinner\n1999). Johan De Wit and Christiaan Huygens of the Dutch Golden age\nrecorded important insights into commercial mathematics (see Daston\n1988; Sylla 2003). The Political Arithmeticians of seventeenth-century\nEngland and Ireland, notably William Petty, Edmund Halley, and John\nGraunt, devised ingenious methods for measuring population, the money\nsupply, and the movement of core prices (see Rusnock 1999). The\nStadialists of eighteenth-century Scotland, namely Lord Kames, Adam\nFerguson, and John Millar, offered a theory of economic development\nbased on four stages, hunting and gathering, shepherding, cultivation,\nand commerce and trade that was partly adopted by Hume and Smith (see\nWolloch 2011).\n\nEarly modern France spawned a number of distinct groups, each one\nadhering to the dictates of a single leader, namely the Colbertistes\n(Jean-Baptiste Colbert), the Gournay Circle\n(Jacques-Claude-Marie-Vincent de Gournay), and most famously, the\nPhysiocrats, who were also known as \u201cles\n\u00e9conomistes\u201d devoted to their founder Fran\u00e7ois\nQuesnay, court physician at Versailles (see Meek 1962; Larr\u00e8re\n1992; Faccarello 1989 [1999]). In the Italian cities, Milan and\nNaples, Enlightenment circles were renowned for espousing the ideals\nof pubblica felicit\u00e0 (public happiness) and\neconomia civile (civil economy). Some of the leading thinkers\nwere Antonio Genovesi, Cesare Beccaria, Pietro Verri, and Ferdinando\nGaliani (see Robertson 2005; Reinert 2018). Portugal housed an active\ngroup of economic thinkers, notably Ant\u00f3nio de Vasconcelos\nNogueira and Isaac da Pinto (Cardoso 1990). In colonial America and\nits early days as the republic of the United States of America,\nBenjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, Alexander Hamilton, and James\nMadison, among others, devised a distinct set of principles on money,\nbanking, capital markets, and property rights that were directly\nindebted to the teachings of Locke, Montesquieu, Hume, and Smith (see\nPocock 1985).\n\nFrom the standpoint of present mainstream economics, the legacy of the\nBritish utilitarians was by far the deepest and longest, starting with\nFrancis Bacon, Shaftesbury (Anthony Ashley Cooper), and Francis\nHutcheson, who coined the phrase \u201cthe greatest happiness for the\ngreatest number\u201d (1725 [1726: \u00a73.8]), a governing principle\nfor both Hume and Smith in their economic inquiries (see Gill 2006;\nDriver 2009 [2014]). Hume\u2019s quartet of \u201chappiness\nessays\u201d (1742 but collected in 1758), and Smith\u2019s two\nbooks (1759, 1776) are replete with insights on the ethical dimensions\nof the pursuit of wealth. Each one recognized that there were many\nimpediments to happiness, that humans are prone to self-deception, to\noverestimate their luck and to underestimate the adversities that life\nholds. They each positioned non-pecuniary goods, equanimity and\nfriendship, as more valuable than material wealth, and issued numerous\ninsights on the various paths one might take with one\u2019s life.\nWhile the debate about the degree to which either Hume or Smith\nadhered more to virtue ethics than to utilitarianism may never be\nresolved, when it comes to their respective economic analyses, their\nconsequentialist observations about untoward ambition or the value of\nforesight fits a utilitarian sensibility (see Sakamoto 2016: Schabas\n2015).\n\nThe early utilitarians, grounded in British empiricism, laid the\nfoundation for both the classical school of political economy and for\nneoclassical economics that commenced with the Marginal Revolution of\nthe 1870s. Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill and Henry Sidgwick made\nmajor contributions to the moral doctrine of utilitarianism and to\npolitical economy. It is important to distinguish the moral doctrine\nof utilitarianism from the utility theory of value that unpacks the\nformation of prices. Utilitarianism provided a framing for economic\nthought from the seventeenth century, whereas the utility theory of\nvalue, while broached multiple times in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, only replaced the labor theory of value in the 1870s.\n\nInterestingly, the majority of the leading contributors to nineteenth\neconomics lived in Britain. This list features David Ricardo, John\nStuart Mill, Alfred Marshall\u2014even Karl Marx, notwithstanding\nJean-Baptiste Say, L\u00e9on Walras, or the Austrians. The\nprevalence of economic discourse in Britain might partly reflect its\nhegemonic standing in global trade, but a more significant factor\nmight be its enlightened culture that fostered freedoms of the press,\nliberal mores, and religious toleration (see Winch 1996).\n\nEighteenth-century economic discourse was more evenly spread across\nthe Continent, but the empiricist school in Britain left the most\nenduring imprint. Locke, Hume and Smith made important contributions\nto economics, whereas scholars have yet to locate significant economic\ninsights in the work of the leading rationalists, Descartes, Spinoza,\nor Leibniz, although Leibniz also wrote extensively on politics. One\ndiscernible pattern is that the leading anglophone contributors to\neighteenth-century economics were, for the most part, not\nEnglish-born, but Dutch, Scottish or Irish; nor were they particularly\ndevout. Locke is the notable exception on both counts. It is important\nto point out that Mandeville (Dutch), Cantillon (Irish-French), and\nthe Scots Law, Hume, and Smith, were inclined to study and promote\ncommerce and trade as the progressive face of a more secular world. If\nmuch of modern economic thinking builds upon moral philosophy, it is\nand was, with a few exceptions, grounded in non-sacred sources.\n\nThis pattern of thinkers on the periphery of the religious status quo\nis also manifest in the nineteenth century, with Say, Ricardo, and the\nMills, p\u00e8re et fils. To engage in the study of economics\ndemands a willingness to overcome the Biblical restrictions on\ncommercial activities. As Voltaire observed, praising the degree of\nreligious diversity in the London stock market,\n\n\nwhere there is not liberty of conscience, there is seldom liberty of\ntrade, the same tyranny encroaching upon commerce as upon Religion.\n(Voltaire [1952: 43])\n\n\nThe fact that individual liberties and religious toleration were more\nprevalent in Britain might provide a more plausible explanation as to\nwhy mainstream economic thought was most cultivated in the English\nlanguage over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\n(see Mokyr 2009). This is in marked contrast to the natural sciences,\nwhich were most concentrated in France in the eighteenth century and\nin Germany in the nineteenth century.\n\nMany contributors to economics were actively engaged in scientific and\nphilosophical societies. The members of the Hartlib Circle of\nmid-seventeenth century England conjoined natural science with\neconomic objectives, not least alchemical pursuits as a solution to\nthe dire shortage of coins (see Wennerlind 2014). Its best known\nmember, the Irish philosopher William Petty, was a leading contributor\nto monetary theory and demography, as well as a founding member of the\nRoyal Society. His economic writings fill two large volumes and he\nbroached the concepts of the transactions level and the velocity of\nmoney, two key variables that cemented the core principle of the\nquantity theory of money. Two of the most renowned philosophers of the\nperiod, Locke and Isaac Newton, were actively engaged in debates over\nthe value of the currency, specifically when Newton served as Warden\nand then Master of the Mint (see Westfall 1981). Hume and Smith were\nmembers of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society (Hume was co-secretary)\nand were close friends of the leading contributors to mainstream\nscience, William Cullen, Joseph Black, and James Hutton in Scotland,\nas well as, in Hume\u2019s case, the French proto-evolutionist Comte\nde Buffon and, in Smith\u2019s case, the French botanist Charles\nBonnet. Smith\u2019s essays on the history of astronomy and of\nphysics, first sketched in the 1750s but updated and revised for the\nrest of his life, display a sophisticated command of science and the\nhistory and philosophy of science. His stance was one of fallibilism\nand instrumentalism, and he broached the possibility that the\nNewtonian system, while ascendant, would one day be superseded (see\nSchliesser 2017).\n\nIn France, the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences offered prizes for\ncontributions to economics, and the multi-volume\nEncyclop\u00e9die (1751\u20131780) produced by Denis\nDiderot and Jean le Rond d\u2019Alembert distinctly positioned\neconomics on the tree of knowledge, as one of the three branches of\nthe moral sciences (politics and natural jurisprudence were the other\ntwo). It contained numerous entries on mining, metallurgy and\ntextiles, including one that illustrated the production of metal pins\nthat most likely inspired Smith for his analysis of the division of\nlabor (Ross 1995, 273-274). There were important entries by Rousseau,\nentitled \u201c\u00e9conomie ou \u0153conomie\u201d (1755), by\nQuesnay, entitled \u201cfermiers\u201d (1756) and\n\u201cgrains\u201d (1757), and by Turgot, entitled\n\u201cfoire\u201d (1756). In sum, eighteenth-century economics was\nconjoined with natural philosophy, both theoretical and applied. It is\nnot by accident that Turgot, best known as an economist and as\nContr\u00f4leur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des finances (1774-1776),\ndevised one of the most critical breakthroughs for the Chemical\nRevolution. His concepts of expansibilit\u00e9 and\nvaporization recognized that each substance, when heated,\nunderwent state changes from solid, to liquid, to gas. A number of the\nleading contributors to eighteenth-century science, notably Carl\nLinnaeus, Leonhard Euler and Antoine Lavoisier, also wrote about\neconomics.\n",
