    "main_text": "Minority Cultural Rights Claims || Assistance rights\n2.2 Assistance rights\n\nDemands for assistance call on the state to preserve the conditions\nunder which various elements of a culture can persist and even thrive,\nespecially minority languages, or to promote and protect cultural\nassociations in various ways, including by offering financial support\nto artists from within these cultural groups, or by providing\nresources to permit the production and distribution of ethnic-language\nmedia. The justification for assistance rights is the same as for\nexemption and modification requests: it is to prevent persistent\nunfairness in access to rights or goods that are meant to be available\nfor all citizens on an equal basis. In the case of assistance rights,\ncultural minority groups argue\u00a0that the majority group has access\nto these goods already, for example to a robust language or media\nspace, and so they request\u00a0state resources to secure\nthese\u00a0goods for cultural minorities as well. Here, whereas the\njustification overlaps with the one offered to defend exemption and\nmodification\u00a0rights\u2014to generate fairness\u2014the\nunderstanding of culture that underpins the demand for these rights is\ndistinct. Typically, exemption and modification claims treat\nculture-as-identity or dialogue, whereas in the case of assistance\nclaims, the background understanding of culture is often\nculture-as-social-formation or culture-as-encompassing group; the\nculture is treated as a whole that requires assistance to protect each\nof its central parts, in order to do\u00a0the job of shaping members\nwell.\n",
