K\u00f6nigsberger observes that this essay was a\n\u201cwork of genius that proved him to be a mathematician of first\nrank\u201d (K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 167).\n\nHelmholtz knew of Euler\u2019s and Lagrange\u2019s previous\nmathematical formulas describing fluid motion. Euler\u2019s equation\ntreated fluids as continua or fields, whereas Lagrange\u2019s\nformulation treats them as discrete particles (see Emanuel 2000, 8).\nHelmholtz took up Euler\u2019s equation, which gives the equations of\nthe flow of fluids in which friction does not alter the fluid\u2019s\nmotion significantly (the \u201cinviscid\u201d fluids). Lagrange had\nremarked that Euler\u2019s equations did not work for\n\u201cviscous\u201d fluids, in which the fluid\u2019s friction\nalters its movement, because Euler\u2019s equations work only on the\nassumption of a general conservation law, and viscous forces are not\nconservative (Farge 2004, cf. K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 167).\n\nHelmholtz, who had formulated a conservation law ten years previously\nin \u201cOn the Conservation of Force,\u201d entered the field at\nthis point. Helmholtz\u2019s own work had concentrated on applying\nthe notion of a potential to fluid movement. But viscous forces do not\nhave potentials. Helmholtz decided to disregard the viscous forces\nthemselves, but also to redefine the problem without appealing to\npotentials. He defined the \u201cvorticity\u201d of a fluid in a\nsmall region as its average rotation or circulation in that region:\nthe rotation at each point on the boundary of the region divided by\nthe area of the region, which is described mathematically as the curl\nof the velocity of the fluid. (In technical terms, Helmholtz evaluated\nthis as the curl of Euler\u2019s equation.) The vorticity of a fluid\nat a single point is a vector quantity. Helmholtz introduced two\nfurther idealizations. A \u201cvortex line\u201d is the tangent to\nthe vorticity vector of a point in the fluid. If you draw vortex lines\non the boundary of a region of the fluid, and then make the region\naround each line indefinitely small, the lines will converge to\n\u201cvortex filaments,\u201d now also called\n\u201cvortices.\u201d\n\nHelmholtz was able to prove three theorems in fluid dynamics using\nthese notions. In their modern expression, they are:\n\n\u201cFluid particles originally free of vorticity [rotation]\nremain free of vorticity.\nFluid particles on a vortex line remain on a vortex line, so that\nvortex lines move with the fluid.\nThe strength of the vorticity is proportional to the length of the\nvortex line\u201d (Fuhs and Shetz 1999, 736).\n\n\nThese laws are used still in fluid dynamics, though they are modified\nslightly from Helmholtz\u2019s original version (they are cited above\nin the contemporary, modified form).\n\nHelmholtz\u2019s work on fluid dynamics is significant\nphilosophically because Helmholtz\u2019s equations requires\nideal fluids, that is, fluids that are free from viscosity\nand perfect continua. Helmholtz\u2019s equations are a paradigm case\nof mathematical idealizations in physics. For a discussion of\nHelmholtz\u2019s work in this context, including his discussions with\nGustav Kirchhoff and the notion, very significant in contemporary\nfluid dynamics, of Helmholtz-Kelvin instability (or Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability), see Eckert 2006, 19ff. For accounts of Helmholtz\u2019s\nuse of idealizations in physics and of the development and\nsignificance of his work in fluid dynamics, see Patton 2009 and\n2012.\n\nIn 1863, a professor of physiology at Bonn, Helmholtz published his\npioneering work on sound waves, acoustics, and musical theory in\nOn the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory\nof Music. One of the most significant discoveries in On the\nSensations of Tone is the precise mathematical description of\n\u201csound vibrations in an open cylindrical tube\u201d\n(K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 206). Helmholtz begins On the Sensations\nof Tone with a description of noise as we experience it in\nordinary life:\n\nWe perceive that generally, a noise is accompanied by a rapid\nalternation of different kinds of sensations of sound. Think, for\nexample, of the rattling of a carriage over granite paving stones, the\nsplashing or seething of a waterfall or of the waves of the sea, the\nrustling of leaves in a wood (Helmholtz 1954 [1863], 7).\n\n\nTo analyze the \u201crapid alternations\u201d of these noises into\ntheir component vibrations, Helmholtz constructed the \u201cHelmholtz\nresonator.\u201d Helmholtz began by removing the bottom of an empty,\nuncorked wine bottle, stretching a membrane over the bottom, and\nfastening the membrane with a band. Then he suspended a single thread,\nwith a bit of wax on the end, from the band so that it hung halfway\ndown the membrane. If the thread is agitated, the bit of wax hits the\nmembrane as a drumstick hits a drum. Based on experimental evidence\nand mathematical reasoning, Helmholtz argued that there will be a\nsingle tone, the \u201cprime tone,\u201d that is the tone at which\nthe membrane vibrates at the highest frequency, based on the thickness\nand size of the membrane. By performing experiments, Helmholtz was\nable to distinguish the prime tones of various membranes. Then if he\nplayed music or made noise, the vibration of the membranes would\nreveal the component vibrations of the sound.\n\nThen Helmholtz had the idea of constructing more sophisticated\nresonators, made of spheres or cylinders of glass or metal. The\nresonators narrow to a small, hollow point at one end, and have a\ncircular opening at the other. Helmholtz placed a small piece of hot\nwax at the small end, let it cool, and then inserted it into his ear\nor the ear of a subject. The prime tone of such a resonator is\ndetermined by its own composition and by the sympathetic vibrations of\nthe ear. If a sound other than the prime tone of the resonator plus\near system is played, the listener hears only muffled noises, but\n\u201cif the proper tone of the resonator is sounded, it brays into\nthe ear most powerfully\u201d (Helmholtz 1954 [1863], 43). Again,\nusing resonators allows an experimenter to distinguish the component\nvibrations of music or ordinary noises, by first determining the prime\nor proper tone of the resonator, and then determining, using the\nresonator, whether the music or noise contains that tone.\n\nHeller (2012) considers Helmholtz\u2019s most enduring contributions\nto be his theories of dissonance and musical harmony (p. 441). In the\ntheory of pitch, Heller analyzes a debate between \u201cHelmholtz and\nGeorg Ohm on one side and Rudolf Koenig and August Seebeck on the\nother\u201d, which engaged physicists and instrument makers alike for\ndecades (441ff.). Heller\u2019s work provides an appreciation of the\nstrengths and weaknesses of Helmholtz\u2019s work from the\nperspective of modern physics and acoustical theory. Deutsch 1984\nprovides a complementary perspective on Helmholtz\u2019s place in the\nhistory of the physiology and psychology of music perception.\n\nHui 2011 and especially 2012 are detailed histories of research in\npsychophysics and in acoustics in 19th century Germany, which\nilluminate not only the social and cultural context, but also the\ndebates over scientific advances and experimental results.\n\nIt is typical of Helmholtz that, even as he was working on acoustics,\nhe realized that his work on sound waves could apply to related wave\nphenomena, if supplemented with mathematical reasoning and\nexperimentation. Recent work on electrodynamics supported the\nconclusion that electricity was a wave phenomenon. In 1845, Faraday\nhad demonstrated the connection between electric and magnetic\nphenomena. In 1856, Wilhelm Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch discovered the\nratio between electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge (Assis\n1994, 18). If he could describe sound vibrations in a cylindrical\ntube, Helmholtz reasoned, similar equations might be successful for\ndescribing the motion of electrical waves around a circular\nboundary.\n\nIn 1861, Helmholtz gave a lecture, \u201cA Universal Method of the\nTransformation of Problems of Electrical Distribution,\u201d to the\nSociety for Natural History and Medicine at Heidelberg. Helmholtz was\nunaware that, in letters to Liouville, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)\nhad achieved the same results that he had, but he was told of this\nimmediately afterward. Helmholtz, who had met Kelvin in 1855 and had\nbeen corresponding with him since 1856, acknowledged Kelvin\u2019s\npriority in the Transactions of the Heidelberg society in 1862, and\nwrote to Kelvin to ask whether he would be willing to publish his\nresults about the \u201cdistribution of electricity at a circular\nedge\u201d (K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 206). Kelvin responded with his\nown results. Between 1861 and 1864, James Clerk Maxwell postulated\nthat light was an electromagnetic wave in the ether (Assis 1994, 18).\nIn 1864, Helmholtz traveled to England. During the trip, Helmholtz met\nwith Kelvin, John Tyndall, George Stokes, James Joule, Michael\nFaraday, Thomas Huxley, Thomas Graham, Max M\u00fcller, and Maxwell.\nHe visited Graham\u2019s, Maxwell\u2019s, and Kelvin\u2019s\nlaboratories. By the end of the 1860s, Helmholtz was well informed on\nthe experimental and theoretical basis of the new electrodynamic\ntheory in England.\n\nAlisa Bokulich (2015) explores the analogies that Maxwell and\nHelmholtz draw between hydrodynamics and electrodynamics, arguing that\ntheir methods give \u201cinsight into debates about the\nrepresentational and explanatory power of mathematical models\u201d\n(p. 28). Susan Sterrett (2017) \u201cprovides a critical history of\nthe concept of physically similar systems\u201d, including the use of\nthe concept in Helmholtz\u2019s theoretical hydrodynamics.\n\nIn 1870, Helmholtz published the first Part of \u201cOn the Theory of\nElectrodynamics,\u201d \u201cEquations of Motion of Electricity in\nConductors at Rest,\u201d in Crelle\u2019s Journal f\u00fcr die\nreine und angewandte Mathematik. In the essay, Helmholtz\nsupported Maxwell\u2019s work, but criticized Wilhelm Weber\u2019s\nelectrodynamic equations, charging that Weber\u2019s equations posit\nan infinite kinetic energy, which contradicts Helmholtz\u2019s\nconservation law of 1847. Weber and Helmholtz disputed the question\nthroughout the 1870s. Over the next several years, Helmholtz published\ntwo more Parts of \u201cOn the Theory of Electrodynamics,\u201d in\nwhich he responded to Weber and continued to support Maxwell\u2019s\nassertion that light is an electromagnetic wave in the ether. The\ndebate between Helmholtz and Weber did not reach a conclusion until\nthe end of the 1880s, when the explanation of electromagnetic force in\nterms of action at a distance between particles in the ether gave way\nto the field theory.\n",
