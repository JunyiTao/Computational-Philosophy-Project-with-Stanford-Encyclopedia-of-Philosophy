The Scientific Endeavor: Astronomy, Optics, and Mechanics\n\n\nGassendi's science is philosophically noteworthy in the way\nthat Descartes' or Kepler's science is, drawing on a robust\nset of views on the nature of the world and what we know of it. His\nscientific work in astronomy, optics, and mechanics is of particular\nimport in suggesting how we should pursue a purely empirical picture of\nthe world, within the limitations of our sensory access and the\nconstraints of tradition.\n\n\nThe principal elements of Gassendi's astronomy include a global\nembrace of empirical method, advanced instrumentation, and\nmeasurement, an interest in unusual celestial phenomena, and a\npartially masked defense of Copernicanism. His embrace of an\nempiricist astronomy can be gauged by his voluminous recorded\nobservations\u2014some presumably with the telescope lenses sent by\nhis friend Galileo\u2014carried out in concert with a league of\nfellow observers strung across Europe and the Near East. A primary\ngoal of these recorded observations was to confirm and extend the\nRudolphine Tables, the project set up by Tycho Brahe and completed by\nKepler, to facilitate calculation of the planet's positions\n(which goal in itself suggests Gassendi's adherence to a\nKeplerian heliocentrism). Another facet of Gassendi's empiricist\nastronomy was his denunciation of astrology as crafted independent of\nany ideas from the senses, impervious to correction by experiment or\nobservation, and thus as failing to qualify as natural or experiential\nknowledge.  This view brought him into direct and bitter conflict with\nJean-Baptiste Morin, who also suspected Gassendi of an\narch-Copernicanism that was not only against Church teaching but would\nobviate the astrological structures central to Morin's theories.\nGassendi's close interests in observation also led to employing\nthe camera obscura to gauge variations in the apparent\ndiameter of the moon\u2014in accordance with its orbit of the Earth\nand the apparent diameter of the Sun. Further, in his work with\nPeiresc, Gassendi tackled the problem of determining longitude by\nreference to lunar eclipses, later working towards this goal with\nClaude Mellan on the first effort to chart the moon.\n\n\nGassendi's interests in unusual celestial phenomena dates back as\nearly as 1621, when he observed the colorful illumination of the sky\nand dubbed these lights \u2018aurora borealis\u2019. Based on his\ncorrespondence with observers as far away as the Levant, he located\nthe source of the illumination at very high altitude, above the\nNorthern Polar region. In 1629, he observed the rare phenomenon of\nparhelia, or false suns, which he explained in his Parhelia\nseu soles\u2026, in terms of the reflection of sunlight by ice or\nsnow crystals at high altitude. This account, shown to be accurate in\nthe nineteenth century, relies on the views of Gassendi and\nPeiresc\u2014based on their microscopical observations\u2014that\ncrystal formations of snow and ice are highly reflective. The great\ntriumph of Gassendi's scanning of the skies was his observation of\nMercury's transit before the Sun (1631), the first such recorded\nobservation and a confirmation of Kepler's prediction of the planetary\norbits in accordance with the Three Laws. This confirmation in turn\nenabled the subsequent calculations (Halley and Gallet, 1677) of the\ndistance between the Earth, the Sun, and the other planets.\n\n\nThe most controversial element of Gassendi's astronomy concerns\nwhether, and to what extent, he may be counted as a defender of\nGalileo and the Copernican view. There is little question that he\nsympathized with Galileo, and that he was fully aware of the merits of\nCopernicanism, at times defending the view and some of its main planks\nopenly. Yet he was also clearly concerned with allegiance to Holy Writ\nas interpreted by the Church, and to this end offers a Church-friendly\naccount of the condemnation that focuses not on the underlying\nheliocentrism but on particularities of the Galilean model (O V 60b).\nHis considered judgment is that the Tychean model is preferable to the\nPtolemaic model, but also to the Copernican model\u2014in the latter\ncase simply because the heliocentric picture does not fit with Church\nteachings. He hastens to suggest, however, that those teachings are\nthemselves warranted by our own current empirical evidence\u2014the\nimplication being that such truths and the concomitant rejection of\nCopernicanism might well be revisable.\n\n\nClosely related to Gassendi's interests in astronomy are a number of\nissues in optics, where he sought to articulate a physiological model\nof vision and a physical model of light. In so doing, Gassendi\ncontributed to early modern efforts that would eventuate in\ndistinguishing these two ends of traditional optics.\n\n\nHis integrated optics model follows an Epicurean and Lucretian\nintromission view, that vision is a function of rays of light atoms or\nimage-bearing atoms that are received by our internal apparatus for\nvision. The structure of this apparatus was of great concern to\nGassendi and his early collaborator on naturalist projects, Peiresc.\nThe premise of their work was that Kepler was largely correct in\npostulating an optical image that gathers many rays into a coherent\nrepresentation in the eye, focused on the retina by the crystalline\nlens. What troubled Gassendi and Peiresc, however, was the notion that\nsuch an image as cast upon the retina would be inverted, leaving the\nproblem of identifying how we see the world as right-side up. Seeking\na physiological solution\u2014as against any psychological capacity\nthat rights the inverted image\u2014they suggested that the retina\nitself acts as a mirror which rights the inverted image projected upon\nit.\n\n\nAnother aspect of this integrated approach to optics was a reliance on\ninternal perceptual phenomena to account for external phenomena\nregarding appearances, illusory or otherwise. This was not a\nuniversally-held view, even in the age of the optics of light and\nvision. In addition to Gassendi's interest in parhelia, he also sought\nto explain apparent discrepancies in the size of the sun and moon at\ndifferent hours by reference to visual experience produced by light\nphenomena (De apparente magnitudine\u2026, 1642). Thus,\nthese bodies appear larger on the horizon than at their apogee because\nthe pupil dilates from the differential exposure to the light at the\nhorizon. (In fact, all such apparent differences are produced by the\ndistance effect of surface features of the area from which the\ncelestial body is viewed.) One key driver of such an appeal to the\ninteraction of light behavior and our visual apparatuses is Gassendi's\nview that some explanatory role must be played here by the common\natomic structure underlying the images intromitted into our eyes and\nthe light rays cast by celestial bodies which are understood as\ncreating such images.\n\n\nGassendi's mechanics shows the strong influence of the Galilean\nprogramme. He addresses the law of free-fall twice, first in a faulty\ntreatment in De Motu (1642), and next in corrected fashion in\nDe proportione qua gravia decidentia accelerantur (1646). In\nthe earlier work, Gassendi focuses on forces compelling the falling\nbody, which he takes to comprise the attractive force of magnetism and\nthe propelling force of air behind the falling body. This combination\nof forces, he suggests, allows for the Galilean law that the distance\ntraveled by bodies in free-fall is proportional to the time of fall\nsquared. However, Gassendi mistakenly takes increases in velocity and\nin distances to be equivalent, leading him to manufacture a false need\nfor greater velocity attained than what would be produced by the\nattractive forces alone. In De Proportione, he acknowledges\nthis error, amends his calculations, and retreats to a causal account\nthat rests on the single force of the terrestrial magnetic\nattraction. This is not one of Gassendi's empirical triumphs,\nthough\u2014in neither work does he make any specific reference to\nobservations or experiments.\n\n\nOne notable success in the experimental domain is his performance of\nthe Galilean test of dropping a stone from the mast of a moving ship,\nrecorded in De Motu. Once dropped, Gassendi shows, the stone\nconserves its horizontal speed (equal to that of the ship, before\nbeing released) and its motion describes a parabola given its downward\nfall. This result successfully refutes one simple anti-Copernican\nargument, by showing that the Earth can move without superadding\nmotion to terrestrial objects otherwise in motion (which\nsuperaddition, opponents of Copernicanism correctly maintained, would\ngenerate much havoc in the motion of terrestrial objects). This much\nGalileo surmised in his original thought experiment, though the\nperformance was excellent publicity for the Galilean perspective and\nan opportunity for Gassendi to think through the issues at stake.\n\n\nIn this regard, Gassendi was able to take a step beyond Galileo's\nconclusions, drawing from this test a generalized principle of inertia\n(the Galilean version of inertia was fundamentally circular, given\nthat bodies in motion would trace the earth's curve). Gassendi saw\nthat the motion of the dropped stone at a sustained speed\u2014in the\nabsence of any contrary force or obstacle\u2014is an instance of\ninertial motion, albeit one where the motion is compositional\n(describing the parabola). Indeed, neither compositionality nor\ndirectionality had any impact on inertial motion, Gassendi concluded:\nany body set in motion in any direction continues, unless impeded, in\nrectilinear path.\n\n\nOther accomplishments in physics included a compelling measurement of\nthe speed of sound (showing that sound travels at the same speed, no\nmatter the nature of its pitch), and the first satisfactory\ninterpretation of the Pascalian barometry experiment. In his account\nof the Puy-de-D\u00f4me experiment, Gassendi proposes that variations\nin air pressure are relative to atmospheric conditions and altitude,\nas the air is an elastic gas. He also suggests that this experiment\n(which he repeats at Toulon in 1650) shows that created vacuum is\npossible, at least as accumulated among part of the air particles in\nthe instrument \u2018sealed\u2019 by the mercury column in the\nexperimental apparatus. In establishing the elasticity of air as a gas\nand accumulated void as a result of particle displacement, Gassendi\nevokes his ontology of atoms and the void.\n",
