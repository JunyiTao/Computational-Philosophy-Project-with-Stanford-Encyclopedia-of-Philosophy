    "main_text": "\n\nIn contemporary legal and political thought, the term \u2018civil\nrights\u2019 is indissolubly linked to the organized, mass liberation\nstruggle of American blacks during the mid-20th century. The Civil\nRights Movement sought the abolition of the Jim Crow system of racial\noppression and exploitation and aimed to make free and equal\ncitizenship a reality for blacks. The idea of civil rights central to\nthe movement referred to the rights belonging, as a matter of justice,\nto free and equal citizens. It was an idea that had found expression\nin those amendments to the U.S. Constitution adopted in the era of\nReconstruction that followed the defeat of the Confederacy in the\nCivil War. \n\nThe Civil Rights Movement sought to redeem the broken promise of free\nand equal citizenship embodied in the Reconstruction amendments.\nSignificant steps had been taken toward fulfilling that promise during\nthe decade that followed the end of the war. However, violent white\nresistance across the former Confederacy and a fading commitment to\nthe promise among Northern whites led to the demise of Reconstruction\nand the rapid consolidation of a new form of racial subjugation. As\nW.E.B. Du Bois poetically put the matter: \u201cThe slave went free; stood\na brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery\u201d\n(1935/1992: 30).\n\nDuring the course of the Civil Rights Movement, a relatively narrow\nidea of civil rights began to dominate public discourse and became the\nstandard idea of what such rights encompassed. The term \u2019civil\nrights\u2019 came to refer, not to the full set of claims\nconstitutive of free and equal citizenship, but to rights against\ndiscrimination, initially denoting discrimination based on race and\nethnicity but soon expanding to include sex, disability, sexual\npreference and other salient categories of social and personal\nidentity. The older and broader idea of civil rights as the full set\nof claims belonging to free and equal citizens was eclipsed, as the\nkinds of issues commonly characterized as involving civil rights\nbecame exclusively concerned with matters of discrimination.\n\nNonetheless, despite the differences in linguistic usage to which the\ntwo ideas of civil rights give rise, there is no substantive\nincompatibility between them. In fact, the older idea subsumes the\nmore recent, on any morally plausible view: it cannot be reasonably\ndenied that the rights constitutive of free and equal citizenship\nencompass, and go beyond, rights against discrimination. But because\ndiscrimination remains a persistent and widely-discussed source of\nsystemic injustice, the standard idea identifying civil rights with\nrights against discrimination is unlikely to fade in the foreseeable\nfuture. Yet, the older idea of civil rights is by no means\nsuperannuated: it remains indispensable to legal and political\ndiscourse, functioning often as part of the implicit normative\nbackground and sometimes as an explicitly articulated subject of the\ndiscourse. This entry will follow the older idea, treating all of the\nrights of free and equal citizens as civil rights; at the same time,\nthe entry gives special attention to current controversies in which\nrights against discrimination are at issue.\n",
