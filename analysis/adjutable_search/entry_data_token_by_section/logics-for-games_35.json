Besides,\nplayers may also change their beliefs about the game upon\ndeliberation, through communication or any other signals they receive,\nbe they reliable or not ( cf.\n Section 4).\n All such dynamic events raise the question of how new information is\nto be incorporated into the agents\u2019 beliefs and when\nprobabilistic updates have corresponding logical revisions or vice\nversa.\n\nIf the new information is of the hard type, accepted as irrevocably\ntrue by all agents, the probabilistic counterpart of logical public\nannouncements is Bayesian conditioning. Both notions track each other\nat a semantic level, meaning that their outputs amount to the same\nthing. Computing beliefs after a public announcement means recomputing\nin the submodel consisting of all states where the information\nreceived was true. This is exactly the same mechanism as for\nrecalculating probabilities in Bayesian update. Moreover, for\nreasoning about updates, both approaches require conditional notions:\nconditional belief and conditional probability respectively. The\nquantitative notion of conditional belief relates to the logical\nnotion of conditional belief \\(B(\\varphi|\\psi)\\), with the slight\ncaveat that the latter also allows for epistemic or doxastic operators\ninside either argument. More refined logical notions of conditional\nbelief arise in the earlier-mentioned plausibility semantics of\n Section 4.1.2,\n (Baltag & Smets 2008).\n\nGiven the co-existence of qualitative and quantitative perspectives,\nit makes sense to ask whether one can track the other. In a\nstatic sense, tracking asks whether different notions of belief can be\ntranslated into each other by omitting or transforming some of the\nsemantic details involved. A dynamic interpretation expands on this by\nasking whether updating, either in the hard or soft varieties of\n Section 4,\n is compatible with these translations in a commutative diagram:\nInformation update in a new perspective after translation should yield\nsame result as first performing a matching update in the old\nperspective and then translating (van Benthem\n2016). In games, the topic of tracking may refer not just to\ninformation update, but also to solution concepts or moves in game\nplay described at the various levels considered in\n Section 2.\n\nThe existence of tracking maps depends on the exact type of update\nconsidered. By now there is a wide variety of updating policies on\nplausibility models (van Benthem & Smets\n2015), not all of which have obvious probabilistic\ncounterparts. Likewise, for well-known varieties of probabilistic\nupdate, such as Jeffrey update, where the probability of selected\npropositions can be reset at will, plausibility counterparts are not\neasy to find, though the attempt of van\nBenthem, Gerbrandy, and Kooi (2009) modifies dynamic-epistemic\nlogic to allow for Jeffrey update and other generalized probabilistic\npolicies.\n",
