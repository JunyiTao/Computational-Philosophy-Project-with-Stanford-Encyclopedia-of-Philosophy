    "main_text": "Passions and Emotions\n6. Passions and Emotions\n\nThe passions and emotions had been a topic of philosophical interest\nsince antiquity and were much discussed in Descartes\u2019 day (James\n1997). His own interest intensified during the 1640s, as a result of\nhis correspondence with Princess Elisabeth (trans. Shapiro, 2007).\nDescartes recognized two separate types of mental states that can be\nclassified as emotions (excitations) of the soul: purely intellectual\nfeelings, such as the intellectual joy of loving God, and\nbody-dependent affects on the mind, called \u201cpassions\u201d (in\nthe etymological sense of the mind being passive in receiving them).\nWe will focus on the latter, which are the subject of Descartes\u2019\nfinal publication, the Passions of the Soul (1649). In the\npreferatory letters to this work, Descartes acknowledged that he\napproaches the passions \u201cas a physicist\u201d or natural\nphilosopher (11:326); but he in fact engaged to some extent all the\nmain genres of writings on the passions: medical, natural\nphilosophical, and moral.\n\nRecall that Descartes attributed only two powers to the mind:\nintellect and will. The intellect is the seat of ideas or perceptions,\nwhich are representations. The will is an active power that responds\nto the represented content, by affirming its truth, denying its truth,\ndoubting it, or desiring it to be the case. The will performs acts\nsuch as choosing to think about mathematics or to raise one\u2019s\narm (Princ. I.32, Pass. I.17\u201319).\n\nIn the Passions (I.22\u201329), Descartes divided the\nperceptions of the intellect that are caused by the body into three\nkinds: perceptions of external objects (such as a candle or a bell);\nperceptions of internal bodily states (such as hunger or thirst); and\nperceptions that we refer to the soul itself, such as bodily love,\nhate, and desire. These passions are \u201cbodily\u201d because it\nis part of their definition that they have a bodily cause (as opposed\nto purely intellectual emotions, which have the soul as cause,\nPass. I.91, 147). This third type of bodily passions can be\ncalled the \u201cpassions proper.\u201d\n\nDescartes defined the passions proper as \u201cperceptions or\nsensations or emotions of the soul that we refer particularly to it\nand that are caused, maintained, and strengthened by some movements of\nthe spirits\u201d (Pass. I.27). Like external sensations,\nthe passions are immediately caused by brain activity (animal\nspirits). But they are referred to the soul, not to an external\nobject, even if they are in many cases triggered by an external\nobject. Suppose that we see a ferocious animal. The sense of vision\ngives us a perception of the shape, size, and color of the animal,\naccording to the ways in which the nerves are affected and cause\nanimal spirits to flow (see Sec. 5). But the flow of animal spirits\nalso causes us to experience the passion of fear. Interestingly,\nDescartes did not hold that we then run from the animal because we\nexperience the fear. Rather, the same flow of spirits that causes us\nto feel fear also, at the same time, by purely mechanical processes\n(see Sec. 4), affects the muscles of the legs so as to make us run.\nThis occurs \u201cwitout any contribution from the soul\u201d\n(Pass. I.38). The function of the experienced passion (the\nfeeling of fear) is to \u201cmove and dispose the soul to want the\nthings for which they prepare the body\u201d (I.40; see also II.52),\nin this case, to make us want to continue running.\n\nThe passions do not respond to all the properties that affect the\nexternal senses. That is, \u201cthe objects which stimulate the\nsenses do not excite different passions in us because of all the\ndifferences in them, but only because of the various ways in which\nthey may harm or benefit us, or in general have importance for\nus\u201d (Pass. II.52). Felt fear responds to the ferocious\nanimal under the aspect of potential harm. Descartes recognized six\nsimple or primitive passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy, and\nsadness (II.69), from which all the other passions are generated.\nWonder arises when we perceive something that is novel. Rare objects\naffect the brain differently than objects we have seen before. The\nresulting brain state causes the body to stay physically focused on\nthe novel object. The experienced passion of wonder then causes us to\nfocus mentally on the same object (II.70\u201378). The inclusion of\nwonder as a primitive type of passion was new (or newly made\nprominent) in the Passions.\n\nThe other five passions present objects as good or bad for us. The\npassion of love makes us want to join ourselves willingly with its\nobject; hatred makes us want to separate ourselves. Desire is a\nfuture-oriented feeling of wanting something it represents as good to\nbe the case. Joy arises from the present possession of a good thing;\nsadness arises when an evil is represented as pertaining to us\n(II.78\u201393). Again, these passions are caused by brain states\nthat arise in the machine of the body. States arise in the brain which\nthen prepare the body for behaviors and cause the felt passion. Here,\nDescartes speaks of brain states as \u201crepresentations\u201d;\njoy, for example, \u201cis a pleasant emotion that the soul has when\nit enjoys a good that impressions in the brain represent to it as its\nown\u201d (II.91). The Passions relies heavily on the\nmechanistic physiology in Descartes\u2019 earlier works.\n\nDescartes\u2019 theory of the passions is complex and covers many\naspects, including the role of the brain, the role of judgment in\ntriggering passions, and the passions in morality. Entrance to the\nliterature can be found in Brown (2006), Rutherford (2021), Shapiro\n(2003), and Hatfield (2007).\n",
