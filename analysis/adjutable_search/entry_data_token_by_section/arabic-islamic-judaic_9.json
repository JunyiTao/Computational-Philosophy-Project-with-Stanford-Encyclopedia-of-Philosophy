    "main_text": "Fakhr al-din al-Razi and Sihab al-din al-Suhrawardi\n10. Fakhr al-din al-Razi and Sihab al-din al-Suhrawardi\n\nTwo Islamic authors pertaining to different ways of Islamic\nAvicennism, Fakhr al-din al-Razi (d. 1210) and Sihab al-din\nal-Suhrawardi (1155-1191), give evidence of having exerted their\n\u2019influence\u2019 over some Jewish philosophers, both in Europe\nand in the Near East.\n\nFakhr al-din al-Razi, a faithful follower and commentator of Avicenna\nand his works as an interpreter of Aristotle, was explicitely\nmentioned and employed as a source by three 14th-century\n\u201cJewish Avicennist\u201d authors (see above, 5). Judah ben\nSolomon Natan mentioned al-Razi\u2019s Oriental Researches\n(al-Mabahit al-mashriqiyya) as one of his reference points in\nthe introduction to his translation of al-Ghazali\u2019s\nIntentions of the Philosophers. Todros Todrosi put some\npassages of the same work, which he personally translated from Arabic\ninto Hebrew, in the margin of his own translation of\npseudo-Farabi\u2019s work, The Sources of Questions: they\nare al-Razi\u2019s definition of the concept of\n\u201cnotification\u201d or \u201cdefinition\u201d, and a\nmetaphysical passage about his \u201cAvicennian\u201d explanation of\nthe chain of the emanations of the intellects from the First\nIntellect, which Todros compares with a similar passage taken from\nAvicenna\u2019s The Salvation. Moreover, in his\nphilosophical anthology Todros mentions other passages about logic\nallegedly taken from al-Razi, which have not yet been identified.\nFinally, Joseph Ibn Waqqar explicitely quotes two passages of\nal-Razi\u2019s commentary on Avicenna\u2019s Remarks and\nAdmonitions, the Core of the Remarks (Lubab\nal-isharat) (see Vajda 1962, 125-126).\n\nAs for Suhrawardi, one of the \u201cmystical\u201d Islamic\ninterpreters of Avicenna, he might have been inspired by some of the\nphilosophical ideas of Abu l-Barakat\u2019s Book About the Point\nof View, in particular his idea about the angels (see Pines 1979,\n254\u2013255), and was explicitly quoted by David ben Joshua\nMaimonides (see Fenton 1984, 36\u201337).\n",
