    "main_text": "The Paradoxes of Motion || The Arrow\n3.3 The Arrow\n\nThe third is \u2026 that the flying arrow is at rest, which result\nfollows from the assumption that time is composed of moments\n\u2026. he says that if everything when it occupies an equal\nspace is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always in a\nnow, the flying arrow is therefore motionless. (Aristotle\nPhysics, 239b30)\n\n\nZeno abolishes motion, saying \u201cWhat is in motion moves neither\nin the place it is nor in one in which it is not\u201d. (Diogenes\nLaertius Lives of Famous Philosophers, ix.72)\n\n\nThis argument against motion explicitly turns on a particular kind of\nassumption of plurality: that time is composed of moments (or\n\u2018nows\u2019) and nothing else. Consider an arrow,\napparently in motion, at any instant. First, Zeno assumes that it\ntravels no distance during that moment\u2014\u2018it occupies an\nequal space\u2019 for the whole instant. But the entire period of its\nmotion contains only instants, all of which contain an arrow at rest,\nand so, Zeno concludes, the arrow cannot be moving.\n\nAn immediate concern is why Zeno is justified in assuming that the\narrow is at rest during any instant. It follows immediately if one\nassumes that an instant lasts 0s: whatever speed the arrow has, it\nwill get nowhere if it has no time at all. But what if one held that\nthe smallest parts of time are finite\u2014if tiny\u2014so that a\nmoving arrow might actually move some distance during an instant? One\nway of supporting the assumption\u2014which requires reading quite a\nlot into the text\u2014starts by assuming that instants are\nindivisible. Then suppose that an arrow actually moved during an\ninstant. It would be at different locations at the start and end of\nthe instant, which implies that the instant has a \u2018start\u2019\nand an \u2018end\u2019, which in turn implies that it has at least\ntwo parts, and so is divisible, contrary to our assumption. (Note that\nthis argument only establishes that nothing can move during an\ninstant, not that instants cannot be finite.)\n\nSo then, nothing moves during any instant, but time is entirely\ncomposed of instants, so nothing ever moves. A first response is to\npoint out that determining the velocity of the arrow means dividing\nthe distance traveled in some time by the length of that time.\nBut\u2014assuming from now on that instants have zero\nduration\u2014this formula makes no sense in the case of an instant:\nthe arrow travels 0m in the 0s the instant lasts,\nbut 0/0 m/s is not any number at all. Thus it is fallacious\nto conclude from the fact that the arrow doesn\u2019t travel any\ndistance in an instant that it is at rest; whether it is in motion at\nan instant or not depends on whether it travels any distance in a\nfinite interval that includes the instant in question.\n\nThe answer is correct, but it carries the counter-intuitive\nimplication that motion is not something that happens at any instant,\nbut rather only over finite periods of time. Think about it this way:\ntime, as we said, is composed only of instants. No distance is\ntraveled during any instant. So when does the arrow actually move? How\ndoes it get from one place to another at a later moment? There\u2019s\nonly one answer: the arrow gets from point \\(X\\) at time 1 to\npoint \\(Y\\) at time 2 simply in virtue of being at successive\nintermediate points at successive intermediate times\u2014the arrow\nnever changes its position during an instant but only over intervals\ncomposed of instants, by the occupation of different positions at\ndifferent times. In Bergson\u2019s memorable words\u2014which he\nthought expressed an absurdity\u2014\u2018movement is composed of\nimmobilities\u2019 (1911, 308): getting from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\)\nis a matter of occupying exactly one place in between at each instant\n(in the right order of course). For further discussion of this\n\u2018at-at\u2019 conception of time see Arntzenius (2000) and\nSalmon (2001, 23-4).\n",
