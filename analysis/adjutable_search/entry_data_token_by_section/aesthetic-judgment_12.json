    "main_text": "Disinterestedness || Disinterestedness: More and Less Ambitious\n3.1 Disinterestedness: More and Less Ambitious\n\nAn idea that plays a large role in Kant\u2019s discussion of the\nsubjective universality of the judgment of taste is that of\ndisinterestedness; and the idea has appealed to many. Kant makes two\nclaims: (a) that pleasure in the beautiful is\n\u201cdisinterested\u201d; and (b) that only pleasure in the\nbeautiful is \u201cdisinterested\u201d (Kant 1790, 5: 204\u2013210\n[2000: 90\u201396: 42\u201350]). These claims are important for\nKant\u2019s project, for Kant connects disinterestedness with the\nclaim to universal validity of the judgment of taste. Before we go any\nfurther, it is important to recognize that the German word\n\u201cinteresse\u201d has a special meaning in eighteenth\ncentury German, and it should not be confused with similar sounding\nEnglish words or contemporary German words. For Kant, an\ninteresse means a kind of pleasure that is not connected with\ndesire; it is neither grounded in desire, nor does it produce it.\n\nWe should distinguish Kant\u2019s more ambitious thesis that\nonly pleasure in the beautiful is disinterested from his less\nambitious claim simply that pleasure in the beautiful is\ndisinterested\u2014for it seems that there could in principle be\nother disinterested pleasures. The less ambitious claim, however, is\ncontroversial enough.\n\nA relatively uncontroversial part of the less ambitious claim is that\npleasure in the beautiful is not grounded in the satisfaction\nof desire. It is plausible, surely, that when we take pleasure in\nsomething that we find beautiful, this is not pleasure in the thought\nthat we have got something that we desire. Kant wants pleasure in the\nbeautiful to be open to all (so there should be no \u201caesthetic\nluck\u201d), and if desires vary from person to person, it seems that\nwe could not require that pleasure from everyone, as the idea\nof universal validity requires. The claim to universal validity would\nbe lost if pleasure in beauty were not disinterested in the sense of\nnot being based on desire. This part of the idea of disinterestedness\nhas much plausibility.\n",
