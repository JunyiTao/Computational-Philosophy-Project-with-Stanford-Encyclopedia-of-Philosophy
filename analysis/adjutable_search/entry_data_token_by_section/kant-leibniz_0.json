    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nLeibniz and his follower Christian Wolff were two of Kant\u2019s most\ncited references. At one time or another, Kant addressed all of\nLeibniz\u2019s main doctrines, including his defense of living forces\nagainst the Cartesians, his attack on absolute space and time against\nthe Newtonians, his immaterial atomism or monadology, his theodicy,\nand his various principles and laws \u2014 the identity of\nindiscernibles, continuity, non-contradiction and sufficient reason.\nThe challenging tone towards the followers of Leibniz that the young\nKant, as an aspiring physicist and cosmologist, and later as a strong\nadvocate of free will, adopted gave way in time to a more respectful\nengagement with the philosopher himself, as Kant became an\nincreasingly determined critic of materialism.\n\nYet Kant\u2019s attitude towards his famous predecessor, whose ideas\nwere extensively discussed in French, and later in Prussian\nintellectual circles after Leibniz\u2019s death in 1716, never\nreaches equilibrium. This is unsurprising, for Kant\u2019s own texts\nshow an attraction to teleological theories of the whole, as well as\nto epistemological caution. Kant describes Leibniz as one of the\ngreatest and most successful reformers of the modern era (9:32), along\nwith John Locke, and as a genius, along with Isaac Newton (7.226). Yet\nhe also refers repeatedly to the errors of the Leibnizians, whom he\nconsiders \u201cdogmatic\u201d philosophers. Their conviction that\nhuman reason could acquire knowledge of supersensible entities,\nincluding the soul and God, necessitated, in Kant\u2019s view, a\n\u201ccritique.\u201d Locke had attempted to construct a critical\nphilosophy against the Cartesians but had failed to carry his\nprogramme through. At the same time, the attacks of Locke and Hume on\nmetaphysics had \u201copened the door to Schwaermerei\u201d. So\ndetermined were Kant\u2019s contemporaries to find affirmations of\nimmortality and divine justice, that, he believed, many had turned to\nthe occult. \u201cSo much there was deceptive, that it is necessary\nto suspend the whole enterprise and to bring instead the method of the\ncritical philosophy into play. This consists of examining the process\nof reason itself, of dividing and testing the human knowledge capacity\nin order to determine how far out its boundaries may be placed\u201d\n(9.32).\n\nThe suspension of the whole enterprise announced by Kant should not\nobscure the fact that Leibniz and Kant shared an ethico-religious\nconception of philosophy. Leibniz wrote in an era in which the\nuniversities were still dominated by Christian philosophy. Whatever\nhis private leanings towards mystical and philosophical religion, he\nbelieved that a strong and unified religious authority was essential\nto the maintenance of moral and political order, and the content of\nmorality did not strike him as problematic. Kant, though steeped in\nProtestant theology and moral philosophy, favoured the newer trend\ntowards the academic autonomy of philosophy and secular morality and\ngovernance. Yet he had to contend with the rising influence of\nmaterialism and deterministic psychology in Germany (10:145); the\nsentiment- and convention-based accounts of morality and moral\nmotivation of the British school, the attacks on metaphysics and\nconventional morals of Helv\u00e9tius, La Mettrie (19:109), and\nVoltaire (15:336) and the attacks of Hume on religion and the concept\nof the soul. How could morality be reconciled with Newtonian science\nand how could the existence of ineluctable duties be established in\nthe face of the variety of human practices and customs established by\nMontesquieu and the numerous travel writers on whose accounts Kant\nrelied in compiling his lectures on Anthropology? Metaphysics could\nnot provide knowledge of the supersensible, including the existence of\nGod, the possibility of the realization of a highest good in the\nnatural world, or the ability of human beings to realize that good\nthrough their endowments. Human aspirations in this regard were\ntranscendent, futile, and \u201centirely vacuous\u201d (20:\n301).\n\nFor Leibniz, the Kingdom of Nature and the Kingdom of Grace were\nparallel orders. Everything in nature happened, as Hobbes and Spinoza\nmaintained, on account of \u2018mechanical\u2019 principles. At the\nsame time, Leibniz insisted in his Principles of Nature and Grace\nbased on Reason (1714):\n\n[A]ll minds, whether of men or [spirits], entering into a kind of\nsociety with God, by virtue of reason and eternal truths, are members\nof a City of God, that is members of the perfect state, formed and\ngoverned by the greatest and best of monarchs. Here there is no crime\nwithout punishment, no good action without proportionate reward, and\nfinally as much virtue and happiness as is possible. (Ariew and\nGarber, 212)\n\n\nReferencing Leibniz, Kant adapted this dualistic scheme into his own\nscheme of transcendental ideas. In nature, everything happened accord\nto laws, though the course of the world might depend on a somewhat\nricher ontology, including lawfully-acting generative forces for the\nformation of plants and animals, than Leibniz had allowed for, forces\nthat human beings might never really understand. At the same time,\nrational beings, though not other souls or minds, formed a moral\ncommunity (see Guyer).\n\nTo view ourselves, therefore, as in the world of grace, where all\nhappiness awaits us, except insofar as we ourselves limit our share in\nit through being unworthy of happiness, is, from the practical\nstandpoint, a necessary idea of reason. (KRV A812/B840)\n\n\nIn this community, reward for having lived a morally worthy life in\nthe form of everlasting happiness was intrinsically deserved, but this\ncould only be hoped for and kept in view, not proved (KRV\nA810\u201318/B841\u201346).\n\nKant denied that the present world contained as much goodness and\nhappiness as possible. Rather, it was definitely progressing towards\ngreater cultural development, and perhaps moral development. Hope and\neffort, especially in the latter struggle where they were most needed,\nwas itself morally mandated (8:8\u201332). So the \u2018idea of a moral\nworld\u2019 had \u2018objective reality\u2019 as a \u2018corpus\nmysticum of the rational beings in it\u2019 even if it was only the\nsensible world viewed in a different but obligatory way.\n\nThe dogmatic metaphysicians preceding him, Kant argued, imagined that\nthey could demonstrate the truth of their doctrines in rigorous\nmathematical fashion, but metaphysical concepts lacked the precision\nand intelligibility of mathematical concepts. At the same time, they\nput their trust in intellectual intuition, which was no more certain\nthan the visionary and mystical writings of Emmanuel Swedenborg, who\nhad set down his hallucinations and angelic dictations in twelve\nvolumes of the Arcana Coelestia (1749\u201356), which Kant\nread in 1765 and satirized in his Dreams of a Spirit Seer in\n1766. Leibniz\u2019s monadology exemplified both errors, for Leibniz\nthought that, merely by rationally considering the problem of the\ndivisibility of matter, he could demonstrate that the basic\nconstituents of the universe were not material particles obeying the\nlaws of mechanics, but living or at least minded beings with\nperception and appetite, acting for the good of the universe. At the\nsame time, the details of his picture of the world behind the\nappearances, incorporating slumbering monads, confused omniscience,\nand the pre-established harmony, seemed to Kant gratuitous\nfancies.\n\nWhere Leibniz rescued ethics and religion by claiming to discover a\nhidden reality of immortal, spontaneous souls forming a Kingdom of\nGrace beneath the material and causally-determined appearances, Kant\nbelieved he could accomplish the task of reconciling the scientific\nview of the world with moral aspiration and accountability by\ninvestigating the necessary preconditions of our experience. Necessary\nforms of thought such as space, time, causality and objecthood would\nthereby be distinguished from constraints embedded in reality. Though\nmaterialism is commonly associated with French Enlightenment figures,\nKant considered it an English vice as well. He associated it not\nhowever with Hobbes and Locke but with Joseph Priestley (KRV B 773;\n4:258), and he was most certainly aware of its German development\nthrough Ernst Platner and others (see Rumore). Determinism and\nmaterialism seemed to him to support a lax moral philosophy, in which\npleasure was conceived as the summum bonum, morality was conventional,\nand humans were anyway machines devoid of responsibility for their\nactions. In those not given to dissipation, skepticism and empiricism\nled, Kant thought, to a sense of moral futility, misanthropy and\ndespair. Kant was determined to attack fashionable, pessimistic, and\nlibertine philosophies, but he had to show that he rejected\nrationalist demonstration as thoroughly as any empiricist.\n\nHis manner of doing so was exceedingly elegant. Kant did not merely\nchallenge the logic of, or poke fun at the extravagances of\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphysics, though he is not above a joke regarding\nthe monads \u2014 potential human lives \u2014 he might be\nswallowing with his morning coffee (2:327). In the antinomies section\nof the Critique of Pure Reason, he shows that, for every\n\u201cproof\u201d of an important metaphysical proposition, such as\ndeterminism, atomism, or the eternity of the universe, a proof of the\ncontrary proposition, such as the existence of exceptions to\nmechanical causality, infinite divisibility, or the temporal finitude\nof the world can be supplied. By attempting to prove too much, human\nrationality accomplished too little. Traditional metaphysics left\nreason perturbed, confused, and unfulfilled.\n\nAs many of Leibniz\u2019s writings were not published until the\n19th or 20th century, an accurate assessment of\nthe relation between the Leibniz and Kant can take into account only\nthose works in circulation in the second half of the 18th\ncentury and available to Kant, his teachers and his interlocutors.\nThese comprised the Meditations on Knowledge, Truth and\nIdeas, the New System of the Nature and Communication of\nSubstances, the Specimen Dynamicum, the\nTheodicy, the Monadology and the Principles of\nNature and Grace, the Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, and\nthe posthumous New Essays, which Kant read four years after\ntheir publication, in 1769. A collection of diverse pieces, edited by\nPierre Desmaizeaux was published in 1720; followed by the more\ncomprehensive Oeuvres philosophiques edited by Rasp\u00e9\nin 1765 , and the Opera Omnia issued by Dutens in 1768.\nChristian Wolff, who may have had privileged access to some of\nLeibniz\u2019s unpublished writings, wrote a series of textbooks\nunder the title Vernunftige Gedancken beginning in 1719,\nreformulating Leibniz\u2019s scattered thoughts on atomism,\ndeterminism, pre-established harmony, and theodicy into scholastic\nformat, that served to bring these doctrines into prominence, as did\nsome writings of Alexander Baumgarten and G.F. Meier, Euler\u2019s\nLetters to a German Princess (1768\u20131772), and Emilie du\nChatelet\u2019s Naturlehre an Ihren Sohn which deal with\nmajor Leibnizian themes, including substance, soul-body relations, and\nthe problem of evil. If Kant brooded on Leibnizian topics, however, it\nwas not, except perhaps in the period of the controversy with J.A.\nEberhard, in which Kant was concerned to distinguish Leibniz from his\nfollowers and to champion what he saw as Leibniz\u2019s special\nPlatonic contributions, with an eye to understanding Leibniz\u2019s\nsystem as a whole or extracting the best possible interpretation from\nit, but rather with an eye to avoiding his errors.\n\nInsofar as Kant professed embarrassment about his pre-1770 essays, it\nmight be tempting to divide his discussion of Leibniz into a\npre-critical (before 1770) and a critical phase. Yet this division is\nnot specially illuminating, and recent scholars have questioned the\nformerly standard periodization (see the entry on\n Kant\u2019s philosophical development).\n The True Measurement of Living Forces, (1747), the\nPhysical Monadology (1756), New Elucidation (1755),\nthe Essay on some Treatments of Optimism (1759), Negative\nQuantities (1763) and the Dreams of a Spirit-Seer (1766)\nare all technically \u201cpre-critical,\u201d but they are critical\nwith respect to logical, physical, and theological Leibnizian\nprinciples and doctrines. It is plausible to see the \u201csilent\ndecade\u201d between 1771 and 1780 as the interval in which Kant\ndecided how to manage the skeptical problem he now saw as threatening\nmorality, arriving finally at the positive philosophy in the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1781) which steers (perhaps only\ntemporarily, judging by the Opus Postumum) a middle course\nbetween visionary and mystical enthusiasm and skepticism. Kant\u2019s\nfurther thoughts on Leibniz were developed in the Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science (1786), the polemical essays,\nOn a Discovery According to which any Critique of Pure Reason has\nbeen made Superfluous by an Earlier One (1790) and What\nProgress has Metaphysics Made in Germany since the Time of Leibniz and\nWolff?(1791), and in the Critique of Judgement\n(1790).\n",
