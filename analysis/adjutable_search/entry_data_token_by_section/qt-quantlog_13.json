    "main_text": "Logics associated with probabilistic models\n4. Logics associated with probabilistic models\n\nAssociated with any probabilistic model \\((\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\) are\nseveral partially ordered sets, each of which has some claim to the\nstatus of an \u201cempirical logic\u201d associated with the model.\nIn this section, I\u2019ll discuss two: the so-called operational\nlogic \\(\\Pi(\\mathcal{A})\\) and the property lattice\n\\(\\mathbf{L}(\\mathcal{A},\\Delta)\\). Under relatively benign conditions\non \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), the former is an orthoalgebra. The latter\nis always a complete lattice, and under plausible further assumptions,\natomic. Moreover, there is a natural order preserving mapping from\n\\(\\Pi\\) to \\(\\mathbf{L}\\). This is not generally an order-isomorphism,\nbut when it is, we obtain a complete orthomodular lattice, and thus\ncome a step closer to the projection lattice of a Hilbert space. \n",
