But that way of justifying\npsychological egoism has a serious weakness. Others can say to this\npsychological egoist: \n\n\nPerhaps the people you know are like this. But my experience\nof the world is rather different from yours. I know many people who\ntry to benefit others for their sake. I myself act altruistically. So,\nat most, your theory applies only to the people in your social\nworld.\n\n\nThe psychological egoist can respond to this criticism in either of\ntwo ways. First, she might claim that his doctrine is supported by\nexperimental evidence. That is, she might believe that (i) the subjects\nstudied by psychologists in carefully conducted experiments have been\nshown to be not purely altruistic, or (more strongly) that these\nsubjects ultimately care only about their own good; and (ii) that we\ncan infer from these experiments that all human beings are\nmotivated in the same way.\n\nThis is a disputed matter. There is experimental evidence that casts\ndoubt on psychological egoism in its strong and in weaker forms, but\nthe controversy continues (see Batson 2011; Stich et al. 2010).\n",
