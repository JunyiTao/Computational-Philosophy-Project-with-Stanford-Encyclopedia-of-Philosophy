    "main_text": "Extending Moral Vegetarian Arguments: Animal Products and Plants || Animal Products\n5.1 Animal Products\n\nAs it might be that meat farming wrong, it might be that animal\nproduct farming is wrong for similar reasons. These reasons stem from\nconcerns about plants, animals, humans, and the environment. This\nentry will focus on the first, second, and fourth and will consider\neggs and dairy.\n5.1.1 Eggs\n\nLike meat birds, egg layers on industrial farms are tightly confined,\ngiven on average a letter-sized page of space. Their beaks are seared\noff. They are given a cocktail of antibiotics. Males, useless as\nlayers, are killed right away: crushed, dehydrated, starved,\nsuffocated. As they age and their laying-rate slows, females are\nstarved so as to force them to shed feathers and induce more laying.\nThey are killed within a couple years (HSUS 2009; cf. Norwood &\nLusk 2011: 113\u2013127, which rates layer hen lives as not worth\nliving).\n\nFreerange egg farming ideally avoids much of this. Yet it still\ninvolves killing off young but spent hens and also baby roosters. It\noften involves painful, stressful trips to industrial slaughterhouses.\nSo, as it is plausible that industrially and freerange farming\nchickens for meat makes them suffer, so too is it plausible that\nindustrially and freerange farming them for eggs does. The same goes\nfor killing.\n\nThe threat to the environment, too, arises from industrial farming\nitself rather than whether it produces meat or eggs. Chickens produce\ngreenhouse gas and waste regardless of whether they are farmed for\nmeat or eggs. Land is deforested to grow food for them and resources\nare depleted to care for them regardless of whether they are farmed\nfor meat or eggs.\n\nIn sum, arguments much like arguments against chicken production seem\nto apply as forcefully to egg production. Arguments from premises\nabout killing, hurting, and harming the environment seem to apply to\ntypical egg production as they do to typical chicken production.\n5.1.2 Dairy\n\nLike beef cattle, dairy cows on industrial farms are tightly confined\nand bereft of much stimulation. As dairy cows, however, they are\nroutinely impregnated and then constantly milked. Males, useless as\nmilkers, are typically turned to veal within a matter of months.\nFemales live for maybe five years. (HSUS 2009; cf. Norwood & Lusk\n2011: 145\u2013150).\n\nFreerange milk production does not avoid very much of this. Ideally,\nit involves less pain and suffering but it typically involves forced\nimpregnation, separation of mother and calf, and an early death,\ntypically in an industrial slaughterhouse. So far as arguments against\nraising cows for meat on the basis that doing so kills them and makes\nthem suffer are plausible, so are analogous arguments against raising\ncows for dairy.\n\nThe threat to the environment is also similar regardless of whether\ncattle are raised for meat or milk. So far as arguments against\nraising cows for meat on the basis that doing so harms the environment\nare plausible, so are analogous arguments against raising cows for\nmilk. Raising cows for meat and for milk produces greenhouse gas and\nwaste; it deforests and depletes resources. In fact, to take just one\nexample, the greenhouse-gas-based case against dairy is stronger than\nthe greenhouse-gas-based case against poultry and pork (Hamerschlag\n2013).\n\nIn sum, arguments much like arguments against beef production seem to\napply as forcefully to dairy production. Arguments from premises about\nkilling, hurting, and harming the environment seem to apply to typical\ndairy production as they do to typical beef production.\n5.2 Plants\n\nAs it might be that animal, dairy, and egg farming are wrong, it might\nbe that plant farming is wrong for similar reasons. These reasons stem\nfrom concerns about plants, animals, humans, and the environment. This\nentry will focus on the first, second, and fourth.\n5.2.1 Plants Themselves\n\nEd drenches Fatima\u2019s prized cactus in pesticides without\npermission. This is uncontroversially wrongful but only\nuncontroversial because the cactus is Fatima\u2019s. If a cactus\ngrows in Ed\u2019s yard and, purely for fun, she drenches it in\npesticides, killing it, is that wrong? There is a family of unorthodox\nbut increasingly common ideas about the treatment of plants according\nto which any killing of plants is at least pro tanto wrongful\nand that treating them as mere tools is too (Marder 2013; Stone 1972,\nGoodpaster 1978, and Varner 1998 are earlier discussions and Tinker\n2015 discusses much earlier discussions). One natural way to\ndevelop this thought is that it is wrong to treat plants this way\nsimply because of the effects on plants themselves. An alternative is\nwrong to treat the plants this way simply because of its effects on\nthe biosphere. In both cases, we can do intrinsic wrong to\nnon-sentient creatures.\n\nThe objection raises an important issue about interests. Singer,\nfollowing Porphyry and Bentham, assumes that all and only sentient\ncreatures have interests. The challenge that Marder, et al. raise is\nthat plants at least seem to do better or worse, to flourish or\nfounder, because they seem to have interests in a certain amount of\nlight, nutrients, and water. One way to interpret the position of\nPorphyry, et al. is that things are not as they seem here and, in\nfact, plants, lacking sentience, have no interests. This invites the\nquestion of why sentience is necessary for interests (Frey 1980 and\n1983). Another way to interpret the position of Porphyry, et al. is\nthat plants do have interests but they have no moral import. This\ninvites the questions of when and why is it permissible to deprive\nplants of what they have interests in. Marder\u2019s view is that\nplants have interests and that these interests carry significantly\nmore moral weight than one might think. So, for example, as killing a\ndog for fun is wrong, so, too, is killing a dandelion. If killing a\nchicken for food we don\u2019t need is wrong, so, too, is killing\nsome carrots.\n\nIf it is impermissible to kill plants to provide ourselves food we\ndon\u2019t need, how far does the restriction on killing extend: To\nbacteria? Pressed about this by Gary Francione, Marder is open-minded:\n\u201cWe should not reject the possibility of respecting communities\nof bacteria without analyzing the issue seriously\u201d (2016:\n179).\n5.2.2 Plant Production and Animals\n\nMarder\u2019s view rests on a controversial interpretation of plant\nscience and, in particular, on a controversial view that vegetal\nresponses to stimuli\u2014for example that \u201croots\u2026are\ncapable of altering their growth pattern in moving toward\nresource-rich soil or away from nearby roots of other members of the\nsame species\u201d (2016: 176)\u2014suffice to show that plants have\ninterests, are ends in themselves, and it is pro tanto wrong to kill\nthem and treat them as tools.\n\nUncontroversially, much actual plant production does have\nvarious bad consequences for animals. Actual plant production in the\nUS is largely large scale. Large-scale plant production\ninvolves\u2014intentionally or otherwise\u2014killing a great many\nsentient creatures. Animals are killed by tractors and pesticides.\nThey are killed or left to die by loss of habitat (Davis 2003; Archer\n2011). The scope of the killing is disputed in Lamey 2007 and Matheny\n2003 but all agree it is vast (cf. Saja 2013 on the moral imperative\nto kill large animals).\n\nThe \u201cintentionally or otherwise\u201d is important to some.\nWhile these harms are foreseen consequences of farming, they are\nunintended. To some, that animals are harmed but not intentionally\nharmed in producing corn in Iowa helps to make those harms permissible\n(see entry on\n doctrine of double effect).\n Pigs farmed in Iowa, by contrast, are intentionally killed. Chickens\nand cows, too. (Are any intentionally hurt? Not typically. Farming is\nnot sadistic.)\n\nThe scale is important, too. Davis (2003) and Archer (2011) argue that\nsome forms of meat production kill fewer animals than plant production\nand, because of that, are preferable to plant production.\n\nThe idea is that if animal farming is wrong because it kills animals\nsimply in the process of producing food we don\u2019t need, then some\nforms of plant farming are wrong for the same reason. More weakly, if\nanimal farming is wrong because it kills very large numbers\nof animals in the process of producing food we don\u2019t need, then\nsome forms of plant farming are wrong for the same reason.\n\nAn outstanding issue is whether these harms are necessary components\nof plant production or contingent. A further issue is how easy it\nwould be to strip these harms off of plant production while still\nproducing foods humans want to eat at prices they are willing to\npay.\n5.2.3 Plant Production and the Environment\n\nA final objection to the permissibility of plant production: There are\nclearly environmental costs of plant production. Indeed, the\nenvironmental costs of plant farming are large: topsoil loss; erosion;\ndeforestation; run-off; resource-depletion; greenhouse gas emissions.\nTo take just the last two examples, Budolfson (2016: 169) estimates that\nbroccoli produces more kilograms of CO2 per thousand\ncalories than pork and that almonds use two and a half times the water\nper thousand calories that chicken does.\n\nIf some forms of animal farming are wrong for those environmental\nreasons, then some forms of plant farming are wrong for those reasons\n(Budolfson 2018).\n\nAgain, an outstanding issue is whether these harms are necessary\ncomponents of plant production or contingent. A further issue is how\neasy it would be to strip these harms off of plant production while\nstill producing foods people want to eat at prices they are willing to\npay.\n5.3 Summary of Animal Product and Plant Subsections\n\nMoral vegetarian arguments standardly oppose treating animals in\nvarious ways while raising them for food that we do not need to eat to\nsurvive. This standardly makes up part of the arguments that it is\nwrong to eat animals.\n\nThese arguments against meat production can be extended mutatis\nmutandis to animal product\n production.[9]\n They can be extended, too, to some forms of plant production. This\nsuggests:\n\n\nThe arguments against industrial plant production and animal product\nproduction are as strong as the arguments against meat production.\n\nThe arguments against meat production show that meat production is\nwrong. Hence,\n\nThe arguments against industrial plant production and animal product\nproduction show that those practices are wrong.\n\n\nOne possibility is that the first premise is false and that some of\nthe arguments are stronger than others.\n\nAnother possibility is that the first premise is true and all these\narguments are equally strong. We would then have to choose between\naccepting the second premise\u2014and thereby accepting the\nconclusion\u2014or denying that meat production is wrong.\n\nAnother possibility is that the argument is sound but of limited\nscope, there being few if any alternatives in the industrialized West\nto industrialized plant, animal product, and meat production.\n\nA final possibility is that the parity of these arguments and evident\nunsoundness of an argument against industrial plant production show\nthat the ideas behind those arguments are being misexpressed. Properly\nunderstood, they issue not in a directive about the wrongness of this\npractice or that. Rather, properly understood, they just show that\nvarious practices are bad in various ways. If so, we can then ask:\nWhich are worse? And in which ways? The literature typically ranks\nfactory farming as worse for animals than industrial plant farming if\nonly because the former requires the latter and produces various\nharms\u2014the suffering of billions of chickens\u2014that the\nlatter does not. Or consider the debate in the literature about the\nrelative harmfulness to animals of freerange farming and industrial\nplant farming. Which produces more animal death or more animal\nsuffering? Ought we minimize that suffering? Or consider the relative\nharmfulness of freerange and industrial animal farming. Some argue\nthat the former is worse for the environment but better for animals.\nIf so, there is a not-easy question about which, if either, to go in\nfor.\n6. Conclusion: Where the Debate About Vegetarianism Stands and Is Going\n\nGiven length requirements, this entry cannot convey the vastness of\nthe moral vegetarian literature. There is some excellent work in the\npopular press. Between the Species, Journal of\nAgricultural and Environmental Ethics, Journal of Animal\nEthics, Environmental Ethics, and Journal of Food\nEthics publish articles yearly. Dozens of good articles have been\nomitted from discussion.\n\nThis entry has omitted quite direct arguments against consuming meat,\narguments that do not derive from premises about the wrongness of\nproducing this or that. Judeo-Islamic prohibitions on pork,\nfor example, derive from the uncleanliness of the product rather than\nthe manner of its production. Rastafari prohibitions on eating meat,\nfor another example, derive in part from the view that meat\nconsumption is unnatural. Historically, such prohibitions and\njustifications for them have not been limited to prohibitions on\nconsuming meat. The Laws of Manu\u2019s prohibition on\nonion-eating derives from what consuming onion will do to the consumer\nrather than the manner of onion-production (Doniger & Smith\n(trans.) 1991: 102). The Koran\u2019s prohibition on alcohol-drinking\nderives from what consuming alcohol will do to the consumer rather\nthan the manner of alcohol-production (5:90\u201391).\n\nArguments like this, arguments against consumption that start from\npremises about intrinsic features of the consumed or about the\nconsumed\u2019s effects on consumers, largely do not appear in the\ncontemporary philosophical literature. What we have now are arguments\naccording to which certain products are wrongfully produced and\nconsumption of such products bears a certain relation to that\nwrongdoing and, ipso facto, is wrong. Moral vegetarians then\nargue that meat is such a product: It is typically wrongfully produced\nand consuming it typically bears a certain relation to that\nwrongdoing. This then leaves the moral vegetarian open to two sorts of\nobjections: objections to the claims about\nproduction\u2014is meat produced that way? Is such\nproduction wrongful?\u2014and objections to the claims connecting\nconsumption to production\u2014is consuming meat related to\nwrongful production in the relevant way? Is being so related wrong?\nExplaining moral vegetarian answers to these questions was the work of\n \u00a72\n and\n \u00a74.\n\nThere are further questions. If moral vegetarian arguments against\nmeat-consumption are sound, then are arguments against animal\nproduct consumption also sound? Might dairy, eggs, and honey\nbe wrongfully produced as moral vegetarians argue meat is? Might\nconsuming them wrongfully relate the consumer to that production?\nExplaining the case for \u201cyes\u201d was some of the work of\n \u00a75.\n\nRelatedly, some plants, fruit, nuts, and other putatively vegetarian\nfoods might be wrongfully produced. Some tomatoes are picked by\nworkers working in conditions just short of slavery (Bowe 2007);\nindustrial production of apples sucks up much water (Budolfson 2016);\nindustrial production of corn crushes numerous small animals to death\n(Davis 2003). Are these food wrongfully produced? Might consuming them\nwrongfully relate the consumer to that production? Explaining the case\nfor \u201cyes\u201d here, too, was some of the work of\n \u00a75.\n\nFischer (2018) suggests that the answers to some of the questions\nnoted in the previous two paragraphs support a requirement to\n\u201ceat unusually\u201d and, one might add, to produce unusually.\nIf meat, for example, is usually wrongfully produced, it must\nbe produced unusually for that production to stand a chance of being\npermissible, perhaps as faultless roadkill (Koelle 2012; Bruckner\n2015) or as the corpse of an animal dead from natural causes (Foer\n2009) or as a test-tube creation (Milburn 2016; Pluhar 2010; see the\nessays in Donaldson & Carter (eds.) 2016 for discussion of\nplant-based \u201cmeat\u201d).\n\nIf consuming meat is usually wrong because it usually bears a certain\nrelation to production, it must be consumed unusually to stand a\nchance of being permissible. Some people eat only food they scavenge\nfrom dumpsters, food that would otherwise go to waste. Some people eat\nonly food that is given to them without asking for any food in\nparticular. If consuming is wrong only because it produces\nmore production, neither of these modes of consumption would be\nwrongful.\n\nAs some unusual consumption might, by lights of the arguments\nconsidered in this entry, turn out to be morally unobjectionable, some\nperfectly usual practices having nothing to do with consumption might\nturn out, by those same lights, to be morally objectionable. Have you\ndone all you are required to do by moral vegetarian lights if you stop\neating, for example, factory-farmed animals? Clearly not. If it is\nwrong to eat a factory-farmed cow, it is for very similar\nreasons wrong to wear the skin of that cow. Does the wrongful\nroad stop at consumption, broadly construed to include buying, eating,\nor otherwise using? Or need consumers do more than not consume\nwrongfully-produced goods? Need they be pickier in how they spend\ntheir money than simply not buying meat, e.g., not going to\nrestaurants that serve any meat? Need they protest or lobby? Need they\ntake more direct action against farms? Or more direct action against\nthe government? Need they refuse to pay rent to landlords who buy\nwrongfully-produced meat? Is it permissible for moral vegetarians to\nbefriend\u2014or to stay friends with\u2014meat-eaters? As there are\nquestions about whether the moral road gets from production to\nconsumption, there are questions about whether the road stops at\nconsumption or gets much farther.\n\nAs discussed in\n \u00a75,\n the moral vegetarian case against killing, hurting, or raising\nanimals for food might well be extended to killing, hurting, or\nraising animals in other circumstances. What, if anything, do those\ncases show about the ethical treatment of pets (Bok 2011; Overall\n(ed.) 2017; Palmer 2010 and 2011)? Of zoo creatures (DeGrazia 2011;\nGruen 2011: Chapter 5; Gruen 2014)? \n\nWhat, if anything, do they show about duties regarding wild animals?\nPalmer 2010 opens with two cases from 2007, one of which involved the\naccidental deaths of 10,000 wildebeest in Kenya, the other involving\nthe mistreatment and death of 150 horses in England. As Palmer notes,\nit is plausible that we are required to care for and help domesticated\nanimals\u2014that\u2019s why it is plausibly wrong to let horses\nunder our care suffer\u2014but permissible to let similar harms\nbefall wild animals\u2014that\u2019s why it is plausibly permissible\nto let wildebeest suffer and die. And yet, Palmer continues, it is\nalso plausible that animals with similar capacities\u2014animals like\nhorses and wildebeest\u2014should be treated similarly. So is the\ntoleration of 10,000 wildebeest deaths permissible? Or do we make a\nmoral mistake in not intervening in such cases? Relatedly, moral\nvegetarians oppose chicken killing and consumption and yet some of\nthem aid and abet domestic cats in the killings of billions of birds\neach year in the United States alone (Loss, et al. 2013; Pressler\n2013). Is this permissible? If so, why (Cohen 2004; Milburn 2015;\nSittler-Adamczewski 2016)? McMahan (2015) argues that standard moral\nvegetarian arguments against killing and suffering lead (eventually)\nto the conclusion that we ought to reduce predation in the wild.\n\nWhat, if anything do moral vegetarian arguments show about duties\nregarding fetuses? There are forceful arguments that if abortion is\nwrong, then so is killing animals for food we don\u2019t need (Scully\n2013). The converse is more widely discussed but less plausible\n(Abbate 2014; Colb & Dorf 2016; Nobis 2016).\n\nFinally, in the food ethics literature, questions of food justice are\namong the most common questions about food consumption. Sexism,\nracism, and classism, are unjust. Among the issues of food justice,\nthen, are how, if at all, the practices of vegetarianism and\nomnivorism or encouragement of them are sexist (C. Adams 1990) or\nracist (Alkon & Agyeman (eds.) 2011) or classist (Guthman 2011).\nIndustrial animal agriculture raises a pair of questions of justice:\nIt degrades the environment\u2014is this unjust to future generations\nwho will inherit this degraded environment? Also, what makes it so\nenvironmentally harmful is the scale of it. That scale is driven, in\npart, by demand for meat among the increasingly affluent in developing\ncountries (Herrero & Thornton 2013). Is refusing to meet that\ndemand\u2014after catering to wealthy Western palates for a long\nstretch\u2014a form of classism or racism?\n\nThe animals we eat dominate the moral vegetarian literature and have\ndominated it ever since there has been a moral vegetarian literature.\nA way to think about these last few paragraphs is that questions about\nwhat we eat lead naturally to questions about other, quite different\ntopics: the animals we eat but also the animals we don\u2019t; eating\nthose animals but also eating plants; refusing to eat those animals\nbut also raising pets and refusing to intervene with predators and\nprey in the wild; refusing to eat but also failing to protest or\nrectify various injustices. Whereas the questions about\nanimals\u2014and the most popular arguments about them\u2014are very\nold, these other questions are newer, and there is much progress to be\nmade in answering them.",
