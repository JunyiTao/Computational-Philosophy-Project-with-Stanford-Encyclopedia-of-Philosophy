    "main_text": "Political Thought\n8. Novalis\u2019s Philosophical Legacy\n\nSoon after Novalis\u2019s death, his friends amongst the romantics,\nled by Tieck and Friedrich Schlegel, started spinning the myth about\nthe \u00fcber-sensitive visionary poet and aesthete, the\nbeautiful soul, forever longing for the unattainable blue flower, the\nsymbol of eternal love and divine grace that would so enthrall the\ncharacter of Heinrich von Ofterdingen. The legend of Novalis as the\narch-romantic author rapidly gained credence, and his literary style\nbecame influential for writers from Georg B\u00fcchner, via the\nsymbolists, to Hermann Hesse and the avant-garde movement in France\nand Germany. In the philosophical domain, the reception of Novalis has\nbeen more reluctant. Some of this reluctance must be explained by the\nfact that until the publication of the critical edition, it was\ndifficult to distinguish between the posthumously created image of\nNovalis, on the one hand, and his real philosophical contribution, on\nthe other. This difficulty also colors the harsh judgments of Hegel,\nNovalis\u2019s most rampant critic among his contemporary\nGermans.\n\nHegel is critical of what he takes to be an undue turn to isolated\nsubjectivity, and in particular its affective and emotional aspects,\nin romantic philosophy. He traces this turn to subjectivity back to\nthe romantic reading of Fichte. The romantics, in his interpretation,\nmisunderstood Fichte\u2019s work. They hypostatized his notion of\nspontaneous self-positing, baking it into a largely aesthetic\nvocabulary of the creative power of imagination. While he places\nNovalis within this framework, Hegel overlooks how he (Novalis) not\nonly draws on but also criticizes Fichte\u2019s philosophy. In\nHegel\u2019s understanding, romanticism in general and\nNovalis\u2019s philosophy in particular leads to a pathological\ncultivation of inwardness, a na\u00efve and otherworldly position that is\nnot only philosophically at fault but also constitutes a genuine\npolitical risk in that it represents an alluring conversion from\ncritical thinking to otherworldly reveries. However, as Otto P\u00f6ggeler\ndemonstrates in his 1956 study, as soon as one distinguishes\nphilosophical romanticism proper from its mythological image, it\nbecomes clear that Hegel stands far closer to the romantics than he\nwas ever willing to admit. In Novalis\u2019s case, the philosophy of\nBildung, a notion that features prominently in Hegel\u2019s\nown work, would be an important point of connection. Others would be\nhis philosophy of interpretation and his conception of the\nrelationship between pre-modern and modern thought.\n\nHegel\u2019s negative assessment proved influential to later times\nand readings of Novalis\u2019s work. Even though Novalis\u2019s\nexperimenting with the philosophical form of the fragment paved the\nway for such stylistically bold and innovative thinkers as Kierkegaard\nand Nietzsche, these figures would, with few exceptions, stage\nthemselves as critics rather than followers of romantic philosophy. In\na wider intellectual context, we find Novalis\u2019s writing attacked\nin Heinrich Heine\u2019s work on recent German literature (1836\n[1995]), Rudolf Haym\u2019s Die romantische Schule (1870),\nArnold Ruge and the young Hegelian philosophy of history (which viewed\nromanticism through the lens of the later Friedrich Schlegel\u2019s\nengagement with Metternich and the restoration), and Karl\nMannheim\u2019s sociological explanation of the rise of German\nconservatism (1925 [1986]).  Whereas the young Georg Luk\u00e1cs\napplauds Novalis\u2019s aesthetics and philosophy of nature, the late\nLuk\u00e1cs worries about the irrationalism of post-Enlightenment\nGerman thought. From the other side of the political spectrum, there\nis Carl Schmitt\u2019s 1919 critique of the romantic movement as\neffecting a dangerous occasionalism in modern political life.\n\nAmong the nineteenth century historians it was Wilhelm Dilthey who, in\nhis grand effort to rehabilitate late eighteenth-century German\nphilosophy, was able to see through the myth of Novalis and call for a\nreassessment of his philosophical work. As is the case with\nDilthey\u2019s return to the young Hegel, his reading of Novalis\nemphasizes the humanistic drive of his thinking as well as his\nphilosophy of art and nature, which gets reinterpreted, in\nDilthey\u2019s lexicon, as a budding philosophy of life. Dilthey,\nhowever, situates Novalis with Goethe and H\u00f6lderlin, and ends up,\nquite against his own intention, highlighting the aesthetic rather\nthan critical-intellectual force of his philosophy.\n\nThe philosophical-literary reception of Novalis\u2019s work first\ntook off with Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1919 study of the romantic\nnotion of literary criticism. In situating the young romantics within\nthe paradigm of Fichte\u2019s philosophy of reflection, Benjamin\nplaces himself well within the traditional reception of their work.\nNonetheless, Benjamin\u2019s interest in philosophy of history, his\nrecognition of philosophers such as Herder, Hamann, and Humboldt, and\nhis general openness towards the late eighteenth-century mindset,\nmakes it possible for him to transcend the framework of traditional\n(Hegelian) prejudices and tease out of the romantic idea of criticism\na pregnant conception of art and subjectivity. Furthermore, because he\nviews modernity as a period of aesthetic reflectivity and\nself-criticism, Benjamin is among the first to see in romantic\nphilosophy a prefiguration of aesthetic modernism and the European\navant-garde. This idea would later fuel the growing interest in German\nromantic philosophy amongst French intellectuals, including\nphilosopher-poets like Maurice Blanchot, George Bataille, and, in the\n1970s and 1980s, the chief proponents of literary deconstruction,\nJacques Derrida and, in an Anglophone context, Paul de Man.\n\nThe broader literary reception of Novalis\u2019s fragments and\npoetical work across comparative literature departments in Europe and\nNorth America contributed to the recent rediscovery of his philosophy:\na rediscovery, one might hope, that will lead to a greater awareness\nof the breadth of his philosophical contribution and a recognition of\nthe fact that his thinking, though celebrated for its religious-poetic\nsensitivity and aesthetic ambience, encompasses much more than that.\nAlthough it is unlikely that Novalis\u2019s work will ever make it to\nthe front rows of academic philosophy, his contribution deserves to be\nrevisited, reread, and reconsidered by scholars of post-Kantian\nthought. Only in this way is it possible fully to reassess the\nsystematic impact of his theory of Bildung, social\nphilosophy, philosophy of history, and theory of language as well as\nhis contribution to aesthetics and philosophy of art.\n",
