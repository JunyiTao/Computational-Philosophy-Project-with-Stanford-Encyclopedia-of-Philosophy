Buffon\u2019s Transformation of Enlightenment Natural History\n\nThe complex set of issues described in the preceding discussion were\nall brought together in the work of Buffon. In a remarkable career\ntransition in 1739 in which he moved from his position as a pensioned\nmathematician in the Paris Royal Academy of Sciences, to the\nDirectorship of the King\u2019s Garden and Natural History Cabinet\n(Jardin du Roi) in Paris, Buffon brought with him to the\ndomain of natural history and to his reflection on issues in biology\nhis deep familiarity with the major theoretical debates dividing\nNewtonians, Cartesians, and Leibnizians in his era. He was also\nintimately acquainted, through his friend Maupertuis. with the debates\nover generation theory and theories of the earth. He fashioned these\ningredients into a set of new perspectives that were to define his\nnovel approach to the life sciences over the last half-century of the\nBourbon monarchy. In the interpretation of this article, Buffon is the\nmajor figure to put together a set of issues that formed the\npre-conditions for transformism in biology, although he would never\nhimself move into this theoretical region. Through his immensely\npopular writings, translated into all major European languages, he\nexerted an influence on discussions that ranged from St. Petersburg in\nRussia to Virginia in the American colonies.\n\nBuffon was able to exert such influence through the concrete\ninstitutional basis provided by the Jardin du Roi, with its\nattendant large Cabinet of specimens collected from all over\nthe world. Under his leadership was created the pre-eminent\neighteenth-century center of research into comparative anatomy,\nchemistry, mineralogy, botany, and biogeographical study (Spary 2000).\nBy providing an institutional setting for these inquiries, the\nspeculations and theoretical reflections of eighteenth-century natural\nhistorians could be subjected to organized critique and specialized\nexamination in a context not found elsewhere in the natural-historical\nsciences of the period. Buffon\u2019s theoretical vision provided a\nconcrete framework against which those immediately associated with the\nJardin were able to develop further reflections on such\nissues as the nature and duration of species, the significance of\ncomparative anatomical studies, the historical relationships of forms,\nthe meaning of fossils, and the systematic relations of living beings\nto one another. Only Buffon\u2019s contemporary, Carolus Linnaeus\n(1707\u20131778), Professor of Medicine and Botany at the University\nof Uppsala in Sweden after 1741, had similar authority in the domain\nof natural history, and Linnaeus did not have the resources and the\ninstitutional authority that characterized the Jardin in the\nlast days of the Bourbon monarchy.\n\nThis simultaneous emergence of Linnaeus and Buffon in the natural\nhistorical sciences of the middle Enlightenment created a major\nrivalry of traditions of inquiry that would play out on several\nfronts. In Buffon, one had the model of the grand and eloquent\ntheoretician of nature who developed major themes in Enlightenment\nnatural philosophy and applied these to biological topics. In\nLinnaeus, one had a pious systematizer of the natural world of his\nera, whose monumental System of Nature (first edition 1735),\nalong with numerous other works, formed the basis for modern\nbiological classification. Their different approaches set the stage\nfor a major theoretical conflict of traditions in natural historical\nscience that would eventually be synthesized in the nineteenth century\n(Hoquet 2007).\n",
