    "main_text": "Content Externalism\n3. Content Externalism\n\nMany mental states or acts (some think all mental states or\nacts) are intentional in that they are about something or other. You\ndo not simply think; you think something. You do not merely\nbelieve or desire; you believe or desire something. This something\nthat you think, believe, desire or, for that matter, hope, fear,\nexpect, anticipate, and so on, is the content of the\nthinking, believing, desiring, hoping, fearing, expecting and\nanticipating. Content externalism\u2014sometimes known as\nsemantic externalism, since content is sometimes known as\nsemantic content\u2014is externalism about the content of mental\nstates or acts.\n\nContent externalism is typically understood as a claim of\ndependent possession which is, in turn, grounded in a more\nbasic claim of individuation dependence. The idea of\ndependent possession is straightforward: whether or not an individual\ncan entertain the content that p (for example, by having a\nbelief, thought, desire or other propositional attitude with this\ncontent) depends on the nature of that individual\u2019s environment\n(and facts about its relation to that environment). It is not possible\nfor an individual to entertain this content unless the environment\ncontains the requisite objects, properties, facts, events etc. of a\ncertain sort (McGinn 1989). Content externalism is the claim that, at\nleast in some cases, though not necessarily all, the possession of a\nmental state with a given content is environmentally dependent in this\nsense.\n\nThis claim of dependent possession is derivative upon a further claim:\nindividuation dependence. The general idea of individuation\ndependence is that the identity of an entity, as an entity of a\nparticular kind s, depends upon things (objects, properties,\nfacts, etc.) distinct from it. A planet is individuation dependent on\na star around which it orbits in the sense that without this star, and\nresulting orbit, it would not be a planet but some other kind of\ncelestial object. The identity of a particular celestial body\nas a planet is dependent on the star and orbit, items\ndistinct from the planet itself. The planet is, in this sense,\nindividuation dependent on the star (Macdonald 1990). A particular\nskin disturbance correctly classified as sunburn is individuation\ndependent on solar radiation in the sense that it can be sunburn only\nif it produced by solar radiation (Davidson 1987). Thus, the\nidentity of a skin disturbance as an instance of sunburn\ndepends on its standing in an appropriate relation to ultraviolet\nradiation, and it cannot be an instance of sunburn unless it stands in\nthis relation. Sunburn is, in this sense, individuation dependent on\nsolar radiation\n\nContent externalism is the thesis that at least some mental content\nis, similarly, individuation dependent on the nature of the\nenvironment, understood as a collection of circumstances that reside\noutside the biological boundaries of the individual. The identity of\ngiven content p is dependent on circumstances that lie outside\nthe biological boundaries of the (objects, properties, facts, events,\netc.) of the individual who entertains this content.\n",
