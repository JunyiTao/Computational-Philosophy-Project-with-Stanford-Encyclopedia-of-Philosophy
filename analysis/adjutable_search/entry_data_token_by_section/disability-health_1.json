Philosophical\ndiscussions of what makes life go well generally recognize three\ndistinct types of accounts. T.M. Scanlon distinguishes \n\n\n\u201cexperiential theories\u2026which hold that the quality of a\nlife for the person who lives it is determined completely\nby\u2026its experiential quality;\u201d \n\n\u201cdesire theories\u2026which hold that the quality of a\nperson\u2019s life is a matter of the extent to which that\nperson\u2019s desires are satisfied;\u201d \n\n\nand \n\n\n\u201csubstantive-good theories\u2026which hold that there are\nstandards for assessing the quality of a life that are not entirely\ndependent on the desires of the person whose life it is\u201d.\n(Scanlon 1998:\n 109ff)[1]\n\n\n\nThe first two accounts are \u201csubjective\u201d, in that they\ndefine well-being as relative to the individual\u2019s mental states,\nwhereas the last theory is \u201cobjective\u201d, assuming a\nsubstantive view about what makes a life go well that is independent\nof the individual\u2019s mental states (see\n SEP entry on well-being).\n\nThese rival accounts of well-being clearly have different implications\nfor the bearing of disability on individual well-being. If, as hedonic\nexperiential theories hold, well-being is a matter of having positive\nexperiences, whether disability reduces well-being depends on whether\nand to what extent it reduces the number or intensity of positive\nexperiences enjoyed by persons with disabilities. On these theories,\nthe self-reports of persons with disabilities carry considerable\nweight in assessments of well-being, at least if we accept the\nassumption that people are in a better position, epistemically, to\nassess the quality of their own experiences than other people\u2019s.\nIndeed, most research on the well-being of people with disabilities\nrelies on self-reports, and those reports do not confirm the grim\nviews of third parties. Most people with disabilities report a quality\nof life similar to people without disabilities (Saigal et al. 1996;\nAlbrecht and Devlieger 1999; Gill 2000; Goering 2008).\n\nFor similar reasons, self-reports ought to carry considerable\nevidentiary weight on desire-based accounts of well-being\u2014though\nperhaps not as much weight as on the experiential view, if we have\nless first-person authority with respect to what our desires and their\nfulfillment than t we do with respect to our experiences. Self-reports\nhave the most limited and contingent relevance on objective accounts,\nsince individuals will not always be in the best position to know how\nwell they are doing in various physical, social, and professional\ndomains.\n\nSome philosophers regard the implication that persons with\ndisabilities can achieve levels of well-being equal to those of their\nable-bodied counterparts as a reductio of subjective accounts\n(see Sen 1980; Crocker 1995). And some disability scholars have been\ndrawn to subjective metrics on the basis of their considered judgment\nthat persons with disabilities can achieve levels of well-being that\nare at least comparable to those of their able-bodied counterparts.\nDespite this, subjective accounts may offer only thin practical\nsupport for the claim that disabled people are not handicapped in the\npursuit of happiness. Many nondisabled philosophers and laypeople are\ninclined to doubt the reliability of disabled persons\u2019\nself-reports to the effect that they are doing well. Some suspect that\nthese ratings are deliberately overstated to take account of their\nexpected discounting by nondisabled people. Others regard them less as\nself-reports than as directives against pity or sympathy. \n\nEven when self-reports are accepted as sincere, the interpretation of\nself-reported well-being is disputed (Menzel et al. 2002; McClimans et\nal. 2013; Barnes 2009b). Some psychologists and philosophers see those\nreports as distorted by adaptation or response-shift; by habituation\nto aversive experiences or a shift to more modest objectives or\ncomparison classes (Menzel et al. 2002; Murray 1996; McClimans, et\nal. 2013). Indeed, the phenomenon of adaptation highlights some of the\ndifferences among rival accounts of well-being.  Adaptation refers to\na group of processes, though which newly disabled people change their\nhabits, activities, and goals to accommodate their disabilities. Among\nthose processes are developing new skills, changing comparison classes\nand goals, and habituating to pleasant or unpleasant experiences\n(Menzel et al. 2002). Although the first of these processes\u2014the\nacquisition of new skills\u2014might reflect a change in objective\nwell-being, the latter two would not (unless feelings of satisfaction\nand pleasure are included on the \u201cobjective\u201d list). But\nhabituating to unpleasant experiences might improve well-being under a\nhedonic account by making the individual feel less pain or more\npleasure. Similarly, insofar as changing one\u2019s goals involves\nchanging one\u2019s desires, and insofar as one\u2019s new\ndesire-set is more satisfiable than one\u2019s old desire set, the\nsecond process of adaptation would also yield an improvement in\nwell-being on the desire-satisfaction view. By contrast, on an\nobjective account of well-being, mere habituation and goal-downsizing\nhabituation would not necessarily improve well-being.\n",
