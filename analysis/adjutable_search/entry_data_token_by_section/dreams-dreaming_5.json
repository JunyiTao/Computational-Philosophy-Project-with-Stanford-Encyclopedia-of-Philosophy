    "main_text": "The ontology of dreams || Are dreams experiences?\n2.1 Are dreams experiences?\n\nCartesian dream skepticism depends on a seemingly innocent background\nassumption: that dreams are conscious experiences. If this is\nfalse, then dreams are not deceptive experiences during sleep and we\ncannot be deceived, while dreaming, about anything at all. Whether\ndreams are experiences is a major question for the ontology of dreams\nand closely bound up with dream skepticism.\n\nThe most famous argument denying that dreams are experiences was\nformulated by Norman Malcolm (1956, 1959). Today, his position is\ncommonly rejected as implausible. Still, it set the tone for the\nanalysis of dreaming as a target phenomenon for philosophy of\nmind.\n\nFor Malcolm, the denial of dream experience followed from the\nconceptual analysis of sleep: \u201cif a person is in any\nstate of consciousness it logically follows that he is not sound\nasleep\u201d (Malcolm 1956: 21). Following some remarks of\nWittgenstein\u2019s (1953: 184; see Chihara 1965 for discussion),\nMalcolm claimed\n\n\nthe concept of dreaming is derived, not from dreaming, but from\ndescriptions of dreams, i.e., from the familiar phenomenon that we\ncall \u201ctelling a dream\u201d. (Malcolm 1959:55)\n\n\nMalcolm argued that retrospective dream reports are the sole criterion\nfor determining whether a dream occurred and there is no independent\nway of verifying dream reports. While first-person, past-tense\npsychological statements (such as \u201cI felt afraid\u201d) can at\nleast in principle be verified by independent observations (but see\nCanfield 1961; Siegler 1967; Schr\u00f6der 1997), he argued dream\nreports (such as \u201cin my dream, I felt afraid\u201d) are\ngoverned by different grammars and merely superficially resemble\nwaking reports. In particular, he denied dream reports imply the\noccurrence of experiences (such as thoughts, feelings, or judgements)\nin sleep:\n\n\nIf a man had certain thoughts and feelings in a dream it no more\nfollows that he had those thoughts and feelings while asleep, than it\nfollows from his having climbed a mountain in a dream that he climbed\na mountain while asleep. (Malcolm 1959/1962: 51\u201352) \n\n\nWhat exactly Malcolm means by \u201cconscious experience\u201d is\nunclear. Sometimes he seems to be saying that conscious experience is\nconceptually tied to wakefulness (Malcolm 1956); other times he claims\nthat terms such as mental activity or conscious experience are vague\nand it is senseless to apply them to sleep and dreams (Malcolm 1959:\n52).\n\nMalcolm\u2019s analysis of dreaming has been criticized as assuming\nan overly strict form of verificationism and a na\u00efve view of\nlanguage and conceptual change. A particularly counterintuitive\nconsequence of his view is that there can be no observational evidence\nfor the occurrence of dreams in sleep aside from dream reports. This\nincludes behavioral evidence such as sleepwalking or sleeptalking,\nwhich he thought showed the person was partially awake; as he also\nthought dreams occur in sound sleep, such sleep behaviors were largely\nirrelevant to the investigation of dreaming proper. He also claimed\nadopting a physiological criterion of dreaming (such as EEG measures\nof brain activity during sleep) would change the concept of dreaming,\nwhich he argued was tied exclusively to dream reporting. This claim\nwas particularly radical as it explicitly targeted the discovery of\nREM sleep and its association with dreaming (Dement & Kleitman\n1957), which is commonly regarded as the beginning of the science of\nsleep and dreaming. Malcolm\u2019s position was that the very project of a\nscience of dreaming was misguided.\n\nContra Malcolm, most assume that justification does not depend on\nstrict criteria with the help of which the truth of a statement can be\ndetermined with absolute certainty, but \u201con appeals to the\nsimplicity, plausibility, and predictive adequacy of an explanatory\nsystem as a whole\u201d (Chihara & Fodor 1965: 197). In this\nview, behavioral and/or physiological evidence can be used to verify\ndream reports (Ayer 1960) and the alleged principled difference\nbetween dream reports and other first-person, past-tense psychological\nsentences (Siegler 1967; Schr\u00f6der 1997) disappears.\n\nPutnam noted that Malcolm\u2019s analysis of the concept of dreaming\nrelies on the dubious idea that philosophers have access to deep\nconceptual truths that are hidden to laypeople:\n\n\nthe lexicographer would undoubtedly perceive the logical (or\nsemantical) connection between being a pediatrician and being a\ndoctor, but he would miss the allegedly \u201clogical\u201d\ncharacter of the connection between dreams and waking impressions.\n[\u2026] this \u201cdepth grammar\u201d kind of analyticity (or\n\u201clogical dependence\u201d) does not exist. (Putnam 1962 [1986]:\n306) \n\n\nNagel argued that even if one accepts Malcolm\u2019s analysis of the\nconcept of dreaming,\n\n\nit is a mistake to invest the demonstration that it is impossible to\nhave experiences while asleep with more import than it has. It is an\nobservation about our use of the word \u201cexperience\u201d, and no\nmore. It does not imply that nothing goes on in our minds while we\ndream. (Nagel 1959: 114) \n\n\nWhether dream thoughts, feelings or beliefs should count as real\ninstances of their kind now becomes an open question, and in any case\nthere is no conceptual contradiction involved in saying one has\nexperiences while asleep and dreaming.\n",
