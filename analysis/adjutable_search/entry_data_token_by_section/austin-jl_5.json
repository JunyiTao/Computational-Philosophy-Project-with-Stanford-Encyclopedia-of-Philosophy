    "main_text": "Knowledge and Perception || Knowledge\n3.1 Knowledge\n\nLet\u2019s begin with some of what Austin says in support of\n (1).\n In his \u201cOther Minds\u201d (1946), Austin sketches a\ndistinction between knowing and believing through appeal to the\ndifferent kinds of challenges that are appropriate to claims to know\nversus claims to believe. First, Austin points out that one who claims\nto know may be challenged to explain how they know, while\nsomeone who claims to believe may be challenged to explain\nwhy they believe. The consequences of failing adequately to\nmeet those challenges are also different: in the first case, the\nconsequences might include that the subject does not know; in\nthe second, the consequence might include, not the subject\ndoesn\u2019t believe, but that they oughtn\u2019t\nto believe. Later, Austin indicates a further basis for the\ndistinction between knowing and believing:\n\n\n\u2026saying \u201cI know\u201d\u2026is not saying\n\u201cI have performed a specially striking feat of cognition,\nsuperior, in the same scale as believing and being sure, even to being\nquite sure\u201d: for there is nothing in that scale\nsuperior to being quite sure. (1946: 99)\n\n\nImportantly, and moving on to claim\n (2),\n Austin holds that knowledge is the upshot of the successful exercise\nof judgmental capacities\u2014which he thinks of as essentially\nlanguage involving\u2014in appropriate circumstances: the successful\nexercise of (judgmental) acumen given (perception- or\ntestimony-based) opportunity. The following two passages are\ncentral to understanding Austin\u2019s views in this area:\n\n\nAny description of a taste or sound or smell (or colour) or of a\nfeeling, involves (is) saying that it is like one or some that we have\nexperienced before: any descriptive word is classificatory, involves\nrecognition and in that sense memory, and only when we use such words\n(or names or descriptions, which come down to the same) are we knowing\nanything, or believing anything. But memory and recognition are often\nuncertain and unreliable. (1946: 92).\n\n\u2026sensa [the things we sense or perceive] are dumb, and only\nprevious experience enables us to identify them. If we choose\nto say that they \u201cidentify themselves\u201d (and certainly\n\u201crecognizing\u201d is not a highly voluntary act of ours), then\nit must be admitted that they share the birthright of all speakers,\nthat of speaking unclearly and untruly. (1946: 97)\n\n\nWe perceive various things, features, events, and states of affairs.\nThe things we perceive are not presented to us as already classified\ninto types. Yet propositional knowledge essentially involves\nclassification: for example, we know that that thing is a\npig. In order to know, we must exercise judgmental capacities,\ntaking stands with respect to the ways the things, features, events,\nand states of affairs are. We must classify the elements into types\nbased on their similarities with elements that we have already\nclassified into types. (Notice that Austin\u2019s view that these\nelements are particulars, articulated in his \u201cTruth\u201d\n(1950a) and \u201cUnfair to Facts\u201d (1954ms), figures\nessentially here.)\n\nReturning to\n (1),\n let\u2019s consider what Austin says about the conditions in which a\nsubject would fail to know. Austin\u2019s discussion is\nhaunted by the following condition: \u201cIf I know, I\ncan\u2019t be wrong\u201d. He never quite endorses the\ncondition. He admits at one point that its third person counterpart\nmakes sense, but characterizes the sense it makes by appeal\nto a prohibition on saying \u201cI know it is so, but I may\nbe wrong\u201d (1946: 98).\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Austin would reject the claim that it is a\nnecessary condition on knowing that it be impossible for one\nto have been wrong\u2014impossible, that is, for one to have\nexercised the same capacities in the same circumstances and to have\njudged incorrectly. For given that he holds that judgmental capacities\nare inherently fallible\n ((3) above),\n it would follow that we can never know anything.\n\n\nThe human intellect and senses are, indeed, inherently\nfallible and delusive, but not inveterately so. Machines are\ninherently liable to break down, but good machines don\u2019t\n(often). It is futile to embark on a \u201ctheory of knowledge\u201d\nwhich denies this liability: such theories constantly end up by\nadmitting the liability after all, and denying the existence of\n\u201cknowledge\u201d. (1946: 98)\n\n\nWhat Austin says here is consistent with the operation of the\ncapacities being reliable in some circumstances, and with their\nreliable operation being such as to give rise to knowledge. So it is\nopen to Austin to hold a view on which knowledge requires that the\nparticular exercises of the capacity to judge on which they\nare based couldn\u2019t have occurred and yet the output judgment be\nmistaken. And it is open to him to hold that if the exercise of\njudgmental capacities is to give rise to knowledge, those capacities\nmust be reliable in the circumstances in which they are\nexercised and given the way they are exercised on that occasion (e.g.,\ncarefully). However, Austin doesn\u2019t make fully explicit that his\nview about knowledge includes either component. And some of what he\nsays\u2014especially in discussion of his performative proposal about\nthe use of \u201cI know\u201d\u2014is in tension with the first\nclaim, on which knowing is incompatible with being\n mistaken.[20]\n (It\u2019s possible that Austin viewed his \u201cIfs and\nCans\u201d (1956a) discussion of abilities as providing further\nillumination concerning the proper understanding of the formula\n\u201cIf one knows, one can\u2019t be wrong\u201d.)\n\nOne potential consequence of Austin\u2019s account concerns\nfoundationalism. Foundationalism typically involves the following\nthree claims. First, many of the ordinary judgments that we\nmake\u2014for example, judgments to the effect that there is a pig\nhere\u2014are inherently risky in the following sense. It\u2019s\npossible for us to make such judgments mistakenly, even in cases in\nwhich we operate as carefully as possible. Second, some of the\njudgments we make, or could make, are not inherently risky: for\nexample, where we are careful only to judge about how things presently\nappear to us, the judgments we make carry no risk of error. Third,\nthen, if our aim is to achieve absolute security, we should avoid\njudgments of the first sort except insofar as they are securely based\nupon judgments of the second sort. (On one view of this type, the\nsecond sort of judgment would be taken to provide evidence on\nwhich judgments of the first sort are based.) Austin\u2019s account\nundermines the first two components of this view. The first component\nis undermined because, although it is always possible to\njudge incorrectly, there are ordinary cases in which our judgments\nabout our environment are, in fact, absolutely secure\n ((4) above):\n\n\n\u2026if I watch or some time an animal a few feet in front of me,\nin a good light, if I prod it perhaps, and sniff, and take note of the\nnoises it makes, I may say, \u201cThat\u201ds a pig\u2019; and this\ntoo will be \u201cincorrigible\u201d, nothing could be produced that\nwould show that I had made a mistake\u2026if the animal then emerges\nand stands there plainly in view, there is no longer any question of\ncollecting evidence; its coming into view doesn\u2019t provide me\nwith more evidence that it\u2019s a pig, I can now just see\nthat it is, the question is settled. (1962a: 114\u2013115)\n\n\nThe second component is undermined because there is no type\nof judgment, and no type of subject matter, with respect to\nwhich error is impossible\n ((3) above).\n In order to have propositional knowledge even about what I am\nexperiencing right now, I must classify it together with other things\nof the same type. And that requires the exercise of capacities that\nare inherently fallible: I may not have had enough experiences of\nthings of the same sort to classify this one securely; I may not have\nattended to what I am experiencing with sufficient care; I may fail\nadequately to remember similar things that I experienced earlier; and\nso forth (1946: 90\u201397; 1962a: 104\u2013131).\n\nOrdinary challenges to judgments or claims, including claims to know,\nare sometimes invitations to detail our credentials\u2014our\npossession of appropriate acumen in making judgments of the type in\nquestion. Sometimes, however, they are invitations to detail our\nfacts\u2014the features of the circumstance that figure in\nour judging in the way that we do. For example, we might claim to know\nthat that presented thing is a goldfinch \u201cby the shape of its\nhead\u201d. If we were to detail our facts in that sort of way, then\nwe might be open to further challenge: someone might claim that\nthat\u2019s not enough of a basis on which to judge that the\npresented thing is a goldfinch. In addition to emphasizing the role of\nspecial acumen in this type of case\u2014not just anyone can tell a\ngoldfinch by the shape of its head\u2014Austin makes two important\nclaims about such potential challenges to our facts. First, Austin\nclaims that, in order for such a challenge to be appropriate, the\nchallenger must have in mind some more or less definite lack, for\nexample by pointing out that birds other than goldfinches have heads\nof that shape. Second, Austin writes:\n\n\nEnough is enough: it doesn\u2019t mean everything. Enough means\nenough to show that (within reason, and for present intents and\npurposes) it \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d be anything else, there is no\nroom for an alternative, competing description of it. It does not\nmean, for example, enough to show it isn\u2019t a stuffed\ngoldfinch. (1946: 84.)\n\n\nThere are at least three, non-exclusive ways of reading Austin\u2019s\nclaim here. The first is as the claim that what suffices for this\nhere to be a goldfinch may not be enough with respect to anything\nin any circumstance. There may be other birds, or other things, with\nheads of the same shape. However, we might still know full well that\nthere are no such birds, and no such things, here; or we may know\nenough about this thing to know it isn\u2019t a bird of that sort, or\none of those other things, even though we haven\u2019t specified how\nwe know in answer to the initial challenge. That is, we may know that\nthis isn\u2019t a stuffed goldfinch\u2014given the rest of\nwhat we know, and the circumstances in which we judge\u2014even\nthough what we explicitly point to in answer to challenges\ndoesn\u2019t alone rule out the possibility. The second way of\nreading Austin here is as allowing that we can know that this is a\ngoldfinch, even though we know that if it\u2019s a stuffed goldfinch,\nthen it is not a goldfinch, and we don\u2019t know that it\nisn\u2019t a stuffed goldfinch. We are entitled\u2014either in\ngeneral, or in circumstances of this sort\u2014to assume or rely upon\nits not being a stuffed goldfinch, even though that is something we\ncan\u2019t rule out and don\u2019t know (see Kaplan 2011 for\ndevelopment of the second way of reading Austin\u2019s views in this\narea). The third way of reading the passage is as claiming that the\nrange of possibilities can vary from occasion to occasion for\njudging or claiming that one knows that this is a goldfinch. On the\nthird reading, it might be impossible, on this occasion, for\nthe presented thing to be a stuffed goldfinch, even though there are\nother occasions on which it would be a possibility. Hence, our facts\ndo not need to foreclose on that possibility on this occasion,\nalthough there might be other occasions on which our facts would need\nto do so. (Travis 2005 develops the third approach. See Millar 2005\nfor objections.)\n\nLet\u2019s turn, then, to\n (7)\u2013(9),\n focusing attention on\n (9),\n the view that utterances of the form \u201cI know that\nsuch-and-such\u201d serve a performative and not a descriptive\nfunction. This is puzzling for at least two reasons: first, the claim\nthat \u201cI know\u201d lacks a descriptive function is apt to seem\nobviously false; and second, it is unclear what, if any, function the\nclaim has in Austin\u2019s account as a whole.\n\nThe main focus of objection to Austin here isn\u2019t the claim that\n\u201cI know that such-and-such\u201d can, on occasion, serve\ndistinctive performative functions. Rather, the concern with\nAustin\u2019s proposal is focused on two more specific claims. First,\nit is focused on the claim that \u201cI know that\nsuch-and-such\u201d always and only serves a distinctive performative\nfunction and so is never at the service of self-description. Second,\nit is focused on the claim that, in cases in which \u201cI know that\nsuch-and-such\u201d is used to serve a performative function, neither\nthe felicity conditions of using the sentence in that way, nor the\ntruth of what, if anything, one thereby states, depend in turn on\nwhether the speaker knows that such-and-such.\n\nAustin is misled here, I think, due to three factors. First, he is\nmisled by similarities between saying \u201cI know that\nsuch-and-such\u201d and saying \u201cI promise that\nsuch-and-such\u201d or \u201cI swear that such-and-such\u201d. But\nthe cases are importantly different. For example, unlike the case of\npromising, in which saying \u201cI promise\u2026\u201d in\nappropriate circumstances makes it so that one has promised\u2026,\nsaying \u201cI know that such-and-such\u201d does not make it so\nthat one knows. Now, as Austin later saw, it is possible to develop an\naccount on which saying \u201cI know that such-and-such\u201d can\nserve more than one purpose and so can function well with respect to\none such purpose while functioning poorly with respect to others (see\ne.g., 1950a: 133 and 1962b). Accordingly, it would be possible to\ndevelop a view on which, for example, saying \u201cI know that\nsuch-and-such\u201d in cases in which one does not know\nwould be improper qua statement (since saying it\ndoesn\u2019t remove the deficit by making it so that one knows),\nwhile properly serving the purpose of giving an audience one\u2019s\nassurance. However, and this is the second reason for which Austin is\nmisled, he had not in \u201cOther Minds\u201d (1946) yet attained\nthe later perspective on which that is a clear possibility. Since he\nnonetheless believes that \u201cI know that such-and-such\u201d\nserves purposes other than statement making, he is forced to efface\nits statement-making function. Finally, and more speculatively, it\nseems that Austin is misled due to his attempting to build into his\naccount a response to a doctrine, common to his Oxford Realist\npredecessors Cook Wilson and Prichard, according to which whether one\nknows or merely believes something is transparent to one. (For\ndiscussion of that feature of Cook Wilson\u2019s and Prichard\u2019s\nviews, see Longworth 2018b, Travis and Kalderon 2013 and Travis 2005.) Although Austin\nrejects the letter of the doctrine, he retains its spirit in\nattempting to provide an account on which avowals of the form \u201cI\nknow that such-and-such\u201d can never be false. (For further\ndiscussion of Austin\u2019s performative proposal, see Warnock 1989:\n24\u201333, Lawlor 2013.)\n\n(For critical engagement with Austin\u2019s work on knowledge, see\nAyer 1967; Baz 2011; Chisholm 1964; Hetherington 2018; Kaplan 2011, 2018; Lawlor 2013, 2018; Leite 2011; Longworth 2018b, Marion 2000a,b; Martin ms (Other\nInternet Resources); Millar 2005; Putnam 1994; Soames 2003:\n171\u2013193; Stroud 1984: 39\u201382; Travis 2005; Travis and Kalderon 2013; Warnock 1989:\n32\u201344; M.
