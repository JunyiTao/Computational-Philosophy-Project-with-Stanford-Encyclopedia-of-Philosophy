    "main_text": "The transcendental deduction\n4. The transcendental deduction\n\nThe transcendental deduction is the central argument of the\nCritique of Pure Reason and one of the most complex and\ndifficult texts in the history of philosophy. Given its complexity,\nthere are naturally many different ways of interpreting the\n deduction.[14]\n This brief overview provides one perspective on some of its main\nideas.\n\nThe transcendental deduction occurs in the part of the\nCritique called the Analytic of Concepts, which deals with\nthe a priori concepts that, on Kant\u2019s view, our understanding\nuses to construct experience together with the a priori forms of our\nsensible intuition (space and time), which he discussed in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic. Kant calls these a priori concepts\n\u201ccategories,\u201d and he argues elsewhere (in the so-called\nmetaphysical deduction) that they include such concepts as substance\nand cause. The goal of the transcendental deduction is to show that we\nhave a priori concepts or categories that are objectively valid, or\nthat apply necessarily to all objects in the world that we experience.\nTo show this, Kant argues that the categories are necessary conditions\nof experience, or that we could not have experience without the\ncategories. In Kant\u2019s words:\n\n[T]he objective validity of the categories, as a priori concepts,\nrests on the fact that through them alone is experience possible (as\nfar as the form of thinking is concerned). For they then are related\nnecessarily and a priori to objects of experience, since only by means\nof them can any object of experience be thought at all.\n\n\nThe transcendental deduction of all a priori concepts therefore has a\nprinciple toward which the entire investigation must be directed,\nnamely this: that they must be recognized as a priori conditions of\nthe possibility of experiences (whether of the intuition that is\nencountered in them, or of the thinking). Concepts that supply the\nobjective ground of the possibility of experience are necessary just\nfor that reason. (A93\u201394/B126)\n\n\nThe strategy Kant employs to argue that the categories are conditions\nof experience is the main source of both the obscurity and the\ningenuity of the transcendental deduction. His strategy is to argue\nthat the categories are necessary specifically for self-consciousness,\nfor which Kant often uses the Leibnizian term\n\u201capperception.\u201d\n",
