    "main_text": "Objections to Pacifism and Possible Replies || Pacifism is Self-contradictory, Unjust, and Not Effective\n6.3 Pacifism is Self-contradictory, Unjust, and Not Effective\n\nObjection: This objection claims that pacifism\nresults in a performative contradiction because an absolute pacifist\nwho is unwilling to defend himself simply ends up dead. A more subtle\nversion of this argument has been articulated by Jan Narveson\n(Narveson 1965) who argued that pacifism involves an internal\ncontradiction that is related to the idea of justice and human rights.\nPacifists are unwilling to use violence to defend against aggression\nbecause they respect life or respect persons. But a contradiction\noccurs when the pacifist who claims that life is an absolute good is\nunwilling to take the necessary steps to defend lives that are\nthreatened by aggression. This objection shares something with those\ndefenders of the just war idea who, like George Weigel, are inspired\nby the Augustinian ideal of using war to defend a tranquil and just\nsocial order. The objection holds that it is immoral to avoid war,\nwhen war could be used to defend the innocent, protect sovereignty,\nand uphold a just international order. This objection can be applied\nboth to defensive wars, in which the state has an obligation to\nprotect its own citizens, and to wars of humanitarian intervention, in\nwhich military power is used to defend the human rights and to\nestablish domestic tranquility and social order in pursuit of peace.\nRelated to this is the claim that nonviolent means of producing social\nchange are ineffective. Critics will claim, for example, that although\nthere appear to be cases of successful nonviolent action in India or\nin the American civil rights movements, these movements were\nsuccessful because of unique set of historical circumstances. Critics\nwill argue that Gandhi\u2019s success was made possible by British\nexhaustion from the World Wars; and they will argue that the success\nof Martin Luther King Jr. was made possible by the threat of violence\nfrom radicals such as the Black Panthers. Moreover, critics will argue\nthat Gandhi and King were successful because their opponents were for\nthe most part sympathetic to their cause from the beginning. But such\ncritics will argue that non-violence will simply not work against\nNazis or terrorists; and that those who think so are dangerously\ndeluded. President Barack Obama articulated this sort of objection to\npacifism in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech (Obama 2009).\nObama expressed respect for pacifists such as Gandhi and King. He\nsaid, \u201cthere is nothing weak, nothing passive, nothing naive in\nthe creed and lives of Gandhi and King.\u201d But he claimed that a\nhead of state cannot be guided by pacifism. And he concluded: \u201cA\nnonviolent movement could not have halted Hitler\u2019s armies.\nNegotiations cannot convince al-Qaeda\u2019s leaders to lay down\ntheir arms.\u201d A similar argument about the efficacy of violence\nhas been made by defenders of insurrectionary violence such as\nMarcuse, Fanon, and Sartre.\n\nReply: One way that a pacifist may reply to this\nobjection is to focus on pacifism as a skeptical political stance\nabout war. Some political pacifists do allow for personal self-defense\nand defense of loved-ones while remaining skeptical of war as a social\nmovement. Another way that a pacifist may reply is to focus on\nconsequences and argue that war produces more negative consequences\nthan nonviolence. Against Narveson, the pacifist might argue that\npacifism is no more contradictory than the idea that we might kill in\norder to defend life. Deontological pacifists will also reply that\nwhile they do value a just and tranquil social order, and may even be\nwilling to die in defense of such as just order, their basic\nprinciples prohibit them from killing in its defense. A pacifist might\nfurther reply to this objection by arguing that the idea that war can\nbe used to defend the innocent is also imprudent and unwise. Pacifists\nwill argue that nonviolent means of defending the just political order\nare the best means to be employed in practice because they remain\nconsistent with the ideals of justice and order that are to be\ndefended. This claim about the unity of means and ends can be used to\nargue against the Fanon/Marcuse justification of violence in\ninsurrection by noting a contradiction in revolutionaries using\nviolence to oppose the violence of oppressive states. A pacifist might\nadd that history shows that violent revolution often either escalates\nor provokes more oppression. With regard to humanitarian intervention,\nsome deontological pacifists will worry that interventions by\noutsiders will run counter to the national right to\nself-determination. And more prudentially minded pacifists will worry\nthat humanitarian intervention will produce resistance and an\nescalation of violence that will undermine the long-term goals of\npolitical stabilization, justice, and reconciliation. Finally, the\npacifist might also appeal to the tragic element in human life: that\nwe often have to make tragic choices in which there is no genuinely\ngood alternative. When confronted with such tragic conflicts, the\npacifist will argue that we should err on the side of peace and take\ncare that we do no harm. The examples of King and Gandhi may in fact\nrequire careful historical analysis; and different historical\ncircumstances will require different sorts of nonviolent action. But,\nfor the pacifist, history shows us the horror of war; and the success\nof Gandhi and King reminds us that there is an alternative. Finally, a\npacifist might also point out that the long term goal of a\ntransformation beyond war is shared by a variety of people, including\nthose who are reluctant to call themselves pacifists. As Obama pointed\nout in his Nobel Peace Prize speech, even if war may be necessary, it\nis also \u201cat some level an expression of human folly.\u201d\nPacifists usually deny that war is necessary. But they agree that war\nis usually an expression of human folly.",
