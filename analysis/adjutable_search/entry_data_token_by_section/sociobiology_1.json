Pop Sociobiology is so-called because it is a\nview about how to study human behavior described in a variety of\nliterature written by Wilson and\n others[4]\n for a general, rather than an academic audience. In this literature,\nWilson and the other \u201cPop sociobiologists\u201d present some\nspeculative and\n preliminary[5]\n sketches of how an evolutionary science of human behavior might\nproceed: Wilson\u2019s main focus in On Human Nature\n(Wilson, 1978) and to a lesser extent the last chapter of\nSociobiology (Wilson, 1975) is to show that such a science is\npossible, to describe some of the techniques that might be used in\npursuing it, and to sketch some possible evolutionary analyses for\ncertain particular human behaviors. Because of its presentation in the\npopular press, \u201cPop Sociobiology\u201d was probably important\nin shaping popular perceptions of the nature of sociobiology in\ngeneral (for example, the Time article, \u201cWhy you do\nwhat you do\u201d 1977, 110 (Aug 1), 54) and consequently drew the\nire of the critics. Unfortunately, the intensity of this debate may\nhave led to a certain amount of mischaracterization of the\nsociobiologists\u2019 views. This section will address the main\nconcerns that the critics raised about Wilson\u2019s early\n\u201cPop\u201d sociobiology, and discuss whether and how far these\nare fair descriptions of his views.\n\nGenetic determinism. In a variety of articles major critics\nof sociobiology such as Stephen J. Gould (1977, 251\u2013259; 1978)\nand the so-called \u201cSociobiology Study Group\u201d (hereafter\nSSG) (Allen et al., 1975; Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the\nPeople, 1976) claim that sociobiologists are strong genetic\ndeterminists. For example, according to the SSG Wilson believes that\nthere are particular genes \u201cfor\u201d behavioral traits,\nincluding indoctrinability, territoriality, warfare and reciprocal\naltruism, and that these genes are subject to natural selection in a\nrelatively straightforward way. Indeed, the SSG (1976) argue that\nclaiming that traits have a selective origin requires that there are\ngenes \u201cfor\u201d them; Wilson\u2019s apparent acceptance that\ntraits may often have a strong cultural component is said to be an\nerror, since if this is true then evolutionary theory tells us nothing\nabout the origin of such traits. Gould (1977) similarly claims that\nsociobiologists do not realize that genes only produce traits with a\ncontribution from the environment.\n\nBoth of these claims are believed, even by other critics, to be unfair\nanalyses of the views of the sociobiologists, and especially\nWilson\u2014for example, Kitcher, one of the strongest critics of\nsociobiology, takes Gould and the SSG to task on this point (Kitcher,\n1985, 22\u201323). In On Human Nature Wilson describes genes\nas, essentially, difference makers\u2014he explicitly claims that\ndifferences in genes, even for heritable traits, only explain the\nvariance in traits across a population; they are by no means\nindependent causes for any trait in individuals and variation in the\nenvironment also accounts for part of the variation in any trait\n(Wilson, 1978, 19). In at least one paper responding to the SSG Wilson\nsays that, on the question of the relative contributions to the\nvariation in human behavior from variation in genes vs. variation in\nthe environment, his \u201cown views lie closer to the\nenvironmentalist than the genetic pole\u201d (Wilson, 1976, 183).\nWilson also does seem to be trying to support his claim that there are\nsome human behaviors which are probably highly heritable: he describes\na variety of different sorts of evidence that might identify them.\nThis evidence includes cross cultural appearance (e.g. Wilson, 1975,\n550; Wilson, 1978, 20, 129); plausible homology with other closely\nrelated species (especially chimpanzees) (e.g. 1978, 20, 27, 151);\nearly development of the trait in question (e.g. 1975, 551; 1978,\n129); differences between individuals that arise without differences\nin their developmental environment (e.g. 1978, 128\u2013130); genetic\nsyndromes that cause behavioral differences (e.g. 1978, 43\u201345);\nand twin studies (e.g. 1978, 145). Finally, Wilson claims that trying\nto change human behavior from its heritable form usually fails or\ncauses misery (Wilson, 1978,\n 20)[6];\n he describes the failures of certain attempts to change the features\nof normal human behavior by massively changing the social environment,\nsuch as the persistence of family ties under slavery (Wilson, 1978,\n136) and in the Israeli kibbutzim (1978, 134). Of course, whether or\nnot all of the above is good evidence for his claims is very much up\nfor debate (Kitcher, 1985; Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the\nPeople, 1976). It is worth bearing in mind that while Wilson thinks\nthe evidence that some human behaviors are heritable is overwhelming\n(Wilson, 1978, 19) he does see many of his specific proposed\nevolutionary explanations as preliminary and speculative rather than\nfully formed (for example, Wilson is explicit that his discussion of\nhomosexuality is preliminary: 1978, 146). For more discussion of the\nproblems relating to heritability when studying the evolution of\nbehavior, see section 4.2. below and the entry on\n heritability.\n\nIgnoring learning and culture. As a concomitant of the\nobjection that Pop Sociobiology was committed to genetic determinism,\nits central players are also often accused of being insensitive to the\nproblem of learning and culture, i.e. to the problem that many traits\nin which they are interested are simply not subject to natural\nselection at all, and that this state of affairs may indeed be common\nin humans (Kitcher, 1985; Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the\nPeople, 1976). However, Wilson, for example, clearly recognized the\nimportant role of culture in many behavioral traits (Wilson, 1976);\nindeed, he thought that even minor genetic differences that made a\ndifference in behavior could be exaggerated by acquired\nculture\u2014this is the so-called \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d\n(although it is seriously in question whether the multiplier effect\nworks \u2013 Maynard Smith and Warren, 1982). Furthermore, partly in\nresponse to these concerns on the part of his critics Wilson\neventually went on to publish Genes, Minds and Culture with\nCharles Lumsden (Lumsden and Wilson, 1981), which was an attempt to\nconsider the effects of cultural transmission on the nature and spread\nof behavioral traits, and of the interaction between genes and\nculture. The book, however, was subject to heavy criticism (see, for\nexample, Kitcher, 1985; Lewontin, 1981; Maynard Smith and Warren,\n1982). The main concern raised was that there was little substance in\nthe models the book provided\u2014the most interesting features of\nthese simply followed from the assumptions built into them, in\nparticular, assumptions about the degree to which genes kept culture\n\u201con a leash\u201d (Lumsden and Wilson, 1981, 13; Wilson, 1978,\n167).\n\nStrong adaptationism. The third problematic feature ascribed\nto Pop Sociobiology was its reliance on an overly strong form of\nadaptationism. In both papers by the SSG (1976) and by Gould and\nLewontin in their famous \u201cSpandrels of San Marco\u201d paper\n(Gould and Lewontin, 1979), the critics of sociobiology argue that\nsociobiologists are committed to a \u201cPanglossian\u201d\nadaptationism. While the \u201cSpandrels\u201d paper is directed at\n\u201cadaptationists\u201d generally, sociobiologists were some of\nits clear targets (for example, David Barash\u2019s (1976) work on\njealousy in male bluebirds).\n\nThe central accusations of the \u201cSpandrels\u201d paper were as\nfollows: that adaptationists treat all traits as adaptations; that\nwhen \u201catomizing\u201d individuals into traits to study they\ntake no care to establish that the traits so atomized could actually\nindependently evolve by natural selection; that they ignore\ndevelopmental constraints on evolution; that they fail to identify\ntraits that are prevalent due to causes other than natural selection;\nthat they fail to distinguish between current adaptiveness and a past\nhistory of natural selection; that they generate adaptationist\nhypotheses, fail to test them properly and replace one such hypothesis\nwith another, ignoring other interesting kinds of evolutionary and\nnon-evolutionary explanation. Instead, according to Gould and\nLewontin, adaptationists tell purely speculative, untestable\n\u201cjust so\u201d stories and present them as science fact.\n\nAgain, insofar as Wilson and other sociobiologists are being purely\nspeculative this criticism may be warranted: quite a lot of the\nevolutionary explanations of particular human behaviors Wilson\ndescribes in the first and last chapters of Sociobiology and\nin On Human Nature are speculation on his part\n(although not entirely speculation). Perhaps the speculative\nadaptationist stories are appropriately described as \u201cjust so\nstories\u201d; the question is whether such stories, treated\nas preliminary hypotheses, are problematic in themselves. Furthermore,\nwhile Wilson made no attempt to test any of his speculative\nhypotheses, behavioral ecologists do try to test adaptationist\nhypotheses about humans and other animals. Again, the proper question\nis whether these tests are appropriate or sufficient to establish the\ntruth of the hypotheses in question. Gould and Lewontin do, however,\nmake some more sophisticated objections to adaptationist methods; some\nof these will be discussed in Section 4.\n",
