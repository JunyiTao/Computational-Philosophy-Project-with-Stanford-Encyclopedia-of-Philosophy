    "main_text": "Guo Xiang: Nature, Destiny, and Self-Realization\n4. Guo Xiang: Nature, Destiny, and Self-Realization\n\nA generation or so after He Yan, Wang Bi and the Seven Worthies of the\nBamboo Grove, Guo Xiang (d. 312) arrived on the Xuanxue\nscene. Accomplished in philosophical debate and other forms of\ncultured discourse, he was highly regarded by his contemporaries as a\nnew Xuanxue champion \u201csecond only to Wang Bi,\u201d\nwhose philosophical prowess had by then acquired legendary\nproportions. Guo Xiang is by far the most important interpreter of the\nZhuangzi in Chinese history. Through his effort, indeed, the\nZhuangzi has come down to us in its present form, divided\ninto thirty-three chapters. Yet, Guo Xiang has also been accused of no\nless an intellectual offense than plagiarism.\n\nAs early as the fifth century, the charge was made that Guo had\nplagiarized the work of Xiang Xiu, a close friend of Ji Kang and\nfellow member of the Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove. Xiang Xiu is\nprimarily noted for his work on the Zhuangzi, though he is\nalso known to have written a commentary to the Yijing.\nAccording to the Shishuo xinyu (4.17), \u201cInitially,\nthere were scores of Zhuangzi commentators, but none could\ngrasp its meaning and essential teachings. Xiang Xiu then went beyond\nthe old commentaries to interpret the Zhuangzi [afresh]. His\nexplanation was subtle and penetrating, which greatly advanced the\ncause of the [Learning in the] Profound.\u201d Xiang Xiu\u2019s\ncommentary was incomplete, as the text goes on to relate, and Guo\nXiang later \u201cstole\u201d it as his own.\n\nThis is a harsh judgment on Guo Xiang. The biography of Xiang Xiu in\nthe Jin shu (Chapter 49) recounts only that Guo Xiang had\n\u201cextended\u201d the former\u2019s work. Although Guo was\nundoubtedly influenced by Xiang Xiu, whose work survives only in the\nform of quotations preserved in later sources, recent scholarship\ngenerally agrees that Guo had drawn his own conclusions. Seeking to\nreconcile the yearning for freedom and transcendence with\nsociopolitical engagement, Guo Xiang fuses together in his\nZhuangzi commentary ontological and ethical insights. It is\nworth noting that despite the extremely unstable political conditions\nthat plagued the early Jin dynasty, and the fact that Guo had come\nfrom a relatively humble background, he enjoyed a long and\ndistinguished public career. Besides the Zhuangzi, Guo also\nwrote on the Laozi and the Lunyu, although these are\nno longer extant except for a few fragments cited in other\nsources.\n\nLike Wang Bi, Guo Xiang recognizes the ontological import of Daoist\nphilosophy. There is no disagreement that all beings originate from\nDao. However, Guo takes issue with the view that the key to unlocking\nthe mystery of Dao lies in the concept of wu, nothingness.\nThis is because nothingness remains an abstraction, a negation\nsignifying what being is not in Wang Bi\u2019s interpretation, and as\nsuch cannot bring about creation. So defined, wu and the\ncategory of beings (you) are mutually exclusive; as Guo\nplainly states, \u201cIt is not only that wu cannot change\ninto being but also that being cannot change into wu\u201d\n[in the abstract sense of nonbeing] (commentary to Zhuangzi\n22).\n\nThe appeal to a divine creator should indeed be rejected, but this\ndoes not entail a nihilistic absence. Having disposed of these\noptions, what does Guo Xiang have to offer in their place? He writes,\n\u201cBecause wu [by definition] is not being, it cannot\nproduce being. Prior to the coming to be of being, it cannot produce\nother beings. In that case, then, who or what brought about the birth\nof being? [The answer can only be that] beings are spontaneously\nself-generated\u201d (commentary to Zhuangzi 2).\n\nXuanxue studies are fond of contrasting Wang Bi\u2019s\nemphasis on wu with Guo Xiang\u2019s focus on being.\nHowever, what is more critical is how Guo Xiang arrives at his\nconclusion. Certainly, the mystery of creation cannot be resolved by\npositing an objectified, transcendent Dao. But, this does not warrant\na flight to nothingness, which as a conceptual device cannot be an\nagent of real production and change. To Guo Xiang, then, the only\nlogical alternative would be to recognize the reality of spontaneous\n\u201cself-production\u201d (zi sheng) and\n\u201cself-transformation\u201d (zi hua or du\nhua). These ideas are already present in Xiang Xiu\u2019s\ncommentary to the Zhuangzi, but in the hands of Guo Xiang,\nthere is now fuller disclosure of the perceived deeper philosophical\nmeaning of ziran.\n\nAt the most basic ontological level, prior to the birth of the myriad\nbeings, being is \u201cso of itself,\u201d which implies that being\nexists eternally. In Guo\u2019s own words, \u201cGenerally, we may\nknow the causes of certain things and affairs near to us. But tracing\ntheir origin to the ultimate end, we find that without any cause, they\nof themselves come to be what they are. Being so of themselves, we can\nno longer question the reason or cause of their being, but should\naccept them as they are\u201d (commentary to Zhuangzi 14).\nIn this sense, \u201cself-production\u201d or\n\u201cself-transformation\u201d does not quite explain\n\u201chow\u201d being came into existence; instead, it offers a\nlogical alternative, which bypasses the philosophical problems\nassociated with both a pure negation and the positing of a particular\ncausal agent. At the epistemological level, the further implication is\nthat self-transformation remains a mystery. Far from being a source of\nperplexities, to Guo Xiang, this frees and reorients the mind to\nrealize the nature of Dao and a life of ziran.\n\nThe doctrine of self-transformation, for which Guo is particularly\nremembered, affirms that the Dao is everywhere and in all things. The\nlogic of immanence takes full effect, once nothingness is removed from\nview. Even in the most base and lowly, as the Zhuangzi\nemphasizes, the presence of Dao can be detected (Chapter 22). To Guo\nXiang, the Zhuangzi can only be alluding to the pervasiveness\nof qi.\n\nAll beings are endowed with a \u201cshare\u201d or allotment\n(fen) of qi, the inexhaustible power of the Dao,\nwhich gives them life and determines their nature and capacity.\nMoreover, the order of nature depicts not a state of random disorder,\nbut an organized regime in which all parts have a role to play. With\nrespect to human beings, for example, the body functions harmoniously\nas a unified whole in accordance with specific principles\n(li). Without undermining the interdependence of the\nmultitude of organs, there is a hierarchical structure to the workings\nof the body, where the mind assumes sovereign control. In these\nrespects, guided by the concepts of qi and principle, Guo\nXiang follows the mainstream Neo-Daoist analysis of\nziran.\n\nGiven that individuals enjoy a particular \u201cshare\u201d of the\nDao, differences in natural endowment should be recognized. For\nexample, due to the different allotment of qi, some people\nare born with a high degree of intelligence or gifted in other ways.\nBecause everything is what it is \u201cso of itself,\u201d Guo Xiang\nmust admit that \u201cwhat one is born with is not something that is\nundue or inappropriate\u201d (commentary to Zhuangzi 5).\nBecause one\u2019s nature is determined by exact principles, one may\nalso speak of destiny in this connection. Is Guo, then, committed to a\nkind of thoroughgoing fatalism? Does this entail a rigid system in\nwhich individuals merely conform to prescribed roles?\n\nIt is a matter of destiny or \u201cfate\u201d that one is born of\nsage character, average capacity, or disadvantaged. In all cases, Guo\nmaintains that one ought to accept one\u2019s natural endowment.\nExtending a naturalistic reading to an old religious concept, this is\nin Guo\u2019s estimation what is meant by the \u201cmandate of\nheaven\u201d (tianming). As it cannot be disputed that there\nare individuals who are blessed with an exceptionally rich qi\nendowment, there is thus some truth to the view held by He Yan and\nothers that sageness is defined by an inborn sage nature. Yet, is it\nthe case that sagehood is restricted to a select few? Guo is also\nconcerned to distinguish destiny as fact from value, and to make room\nfor change and development in human flourishing.\n\nDifferences based on endowment do not constitute any basis for value\njudgment. This is central to Guo\u2019s overall argument and is\nreminiscent of Ruan Ji\u2019s view of naturalness in some respects.\nAs the Zhuangzi repeatedly argues, what needs to be\nrecognized is the \u201cequality of things.\u201d Equality is not to\nbe confused with sameness. In this context, equality suggests that all\nbeings are partners in the larger architecture of Dao. Being gifted\ndoes not necessarily make one \u201cbetter\u201d; even a physically\nor mentally handicapped person is \u201ccomplete\u201d in his or her\nown way. Differences among individuals are undeniable, but they do not\nlegitimize prejudice or discrimination.\n\nAt the sociopolitical level, human relationships are also governed by\nconstant principles; like different parts of the body, individuals\nhave their proper place in the social and political assembly. From\nthis perspective, as opposed to conventional arrangements that can be\nchanged or discarded at will, both the family and the state should be\nunderstood as expressions of ziran.\n\nFurthermore, in view of the hierarchical order of nature, Guo does not\nhesitate to say that the father should be the head of the family, and\nthat the state should be ruled by the king. This would rule out\nanarchism. In this regard, while Guo Xiang and Ruan Ji agree on the\ncentrality of naturalness, they come to very different conclusions on\nthe ideal structure of the state. What needs to be made clear is that\nthe necessary gradation of authority for different roles and\nresponsibilities that comes with a hierarchical system does not\nwarrant any form of authoritarian government that oppresses the\npeople. The father may be the authoritative figure in the family, but\nhe would not be in that position if not for his children. As\n\u201cchildren\u201d of the Dao, all beings are indispensable and\noccupy an equally important station in the order of\nziran.\n\nWhereas scholars such as Wang Bi emphasize unity over multiplicity,\nGuo Xiang underscores the richness and diversity of the Daoist world.\nIndividuality is not sacrificed for political interests, or dissolved\ninto a sea of metaphysical oneness. On the contrary, as Guo forcefully\nargues, there is no greater calamity than the loss of individuality\nand authenticity, of one\u2019s identity as endowed by nature\n(commentary to Zhuangzi 10). Conversely, the Daoist goal can\nbe defined as the realization of one\u2019s nature, and particularly\nthe optimization of one\u2019s inborn capacity. As nature blossoms,\ndestiny is fulfilled.\n\nWhile this may not be able to detract entirely from the charge of\nfatalism, Guo Xiang does aim to introduce a dynamic view of nature and\ndestiny. It also opens up a deeper dimension to the notion of\nsagehood. The Daoist world is never static; it changes and renews\nitself constantly. The mountain or ocean may appear unchanging, but it\nis perpetually in flux. This is mirrored in human existence, where\nindividuals grow with the passage of time (commentary to\nZhuangzi 6). Although constituted by qi and\nregulated by principles, individuals and societies need not be viewed\nas fixed assets without possibility of change and development. Indeed,\nwhile the order of nature must be respected, the person of Dao\nrecognizes the inevitability of change. The sage nourishes his nature\nand adapts constantly to changes in the social and natural\nenvironment. This, as Guo Xiang sees it, brings out the real meaning\nof Daoist nonaction (wuwei).\n\nNonaction \u201cdoes not mean folding one\u2019s arms and keeping\nquiet,\u201d as Guo makes explicit what most Xuanxue\nscholars implicitly acknowledge (commentary to Zhuangzi 11).\nIt is also not a technical skill, requiring special training or\ndiscipline. In Guo Xiang\u2019s interpretation, nonaction stems from\na profound discernment of the way of naturalness, which entails not so\nmuch doing less of certain things, as a mode of being and spirit of\naction guided by the principles of nature, according to which one\nperforms all functions.\n\nThere are two aspects to Guo\u2019s understanding of wuwei.\nFirst, as things and affairs are informed by principles, there is a\nnatural way of action and interaction. Like the fabulous Cook Ding\n(Zhuangzi 3) who could cut up an ox without having to rely on\nsensory perception or mental calculation, and just as spontaneous\naffection characterizes the parent-child relation, the sage\naccomplishes all tasks by simply following the \u201cgrain\u201d or\nnature of phenomena.\n\nSecond, in the light of the equality of things, nonaction ideally\nleads to a sense of freedom and equanimity. Instead of chasing after\nfalse ideals, trying to be like someone else, and ending up a prisoner\nof restless striving and deceit, one should stay true to oneself and\ndevelop one\u2019s nature. If self-sufficiency is assumed, there is\nno point in imitating others, including those blessed with a special\nqi endowment; to do so, indeed, as Guo Xiang puts it, would\nbe like a fish\u2019s aspiring to become a bird (commentary to\nZhuangzi 2).\n\nThis is important and marks Guo\u2019s originality. Nonaction cannot\nbe divorced from naturalness or reserved for those with an inborn sage\nnature alone. What is required of self-fulfillment has already been\ngiven; to clamor after what is foreign to one\u2019s genuine\n\u201cshare\u201d of the Dao is not only futile but also\nself-negating. If this is true, the very idea of sageness needs to be\nreconsidered. \n\nAgain, it should be recognized that there are those who embody a\nspecial sage nature\u2014they are like \u201cpines and\ncypresses,\u201d which are the finest of trees (commentary to\nZhuangzi 5)\u2014but more fundamentally, as Guo Xiang\nexplains, the term \u201csage\u201d designates those who have\nrealized their nature (commentary to Zhuangzi 1). This\neffectively removes any barrier to attaining sagehood. Thus, while Guo\nagrees with He Yan in recognizing the decisive difference of\nqi endowment, he is also able to address Wang Bi\u2019s\nobjection, discussed earlier, and offer an alternative avenue to\nrealizing great peace.\n\nAgainst helplessness and passive resignation, Guo Xiang calls for a\nconstructive celebration of individuality and the plenitude of the\nDaoist world. Free from the hold of desire and the ceaseless\nundulation of discontent, one reaps an inner calm and grows at ease\nwith the external world. Even death loses its fearsome grip, for one\nrealizes that life and death are equally a part of the transformation\nof nature. The person of Dao does not need to live in reclusion or\nshun politics. In fact, any deliberate disavowal of communal life\nwould violate the spirit of naturalness. The important point is that\n\u201calthough the sage [in the broad sense of someone who has\nrealized his true nature] finds himself in the halls of ritual and\ngovernment, his mind is not different from when he is surrounded by\nmountains and trees\u201d (commentary to Zhuangzi 1). Beyond\nthe sway of the emotions, the sage roams the world without being moved\nor enslaved by it. This, to Guo Xiang, truly captures the essence of\n\u201ccarefree wandering,\u201d which is now shown to have a place\nin mundane activities.\n\nPolitically, the ruler should also abide by naturalness and nonaction.\nThis means, besides self-cultivation, allowing and encouraging the\npeople to develop their nature and capacity to the fullest. Thus,\nartificial restrictions and interference should be minimized. Official\nappointments, moreover, must be made on the basis of capacity and not\nby family background, as was commonly the case in Guo\u2019s China.\nIn return, as Guo confidently predicts, ministers and subjects would\nnaturally fulfill their duties, and all under heaven would live in\npeace and contentment. As needs and circumstances change, social and\npolitical practice should not be fossilized. Timely adjustments would\nhelp ensure renewal and harmony in a dynamic realm.\n",
