    "main_text": "Linguistics || Relational Approaches\n4.4 Relational Approaches\n\nTo conclude this section, we will briefly mention some contemporary\napproaches to word meaning that, in different ways, pursue the\ntheoretical agenda of the relational current of the structuralist\nparadigm. For pedagogical convenience, we can group them into two\ncategories. On the one hand, we have network approaches,\nwhich formalize knowledge of word meaning within models where the\nlexicon is seen as a structured system of entries interconnected by\nsense relations such as synonymy, antonymy, and meronymy. On the\nother, we have statistical approaches, whose primary aim is\nto investigate the patterns of co-occurrence among words in linguistic\ncorpora.\n\nThe main example of network approaches is perhaps Collins and\nQuillian\u2019s (1969) hierarchical network model, in which words are\nrepresented as entries in a network of nodes, each comprising a set of\nconceptual features defining the conventional meaning of the word in\nquestion, and connected to other nodes in the network through semantic\nrelations (more in Lehman 1992). Subsequent developments of the\nhierarchical network model include the Semantic Feature Model (Smith,\nShoben & Rips 1974), the Spreading Activation Model (Collins &\nLoftus 1975; Bock & Levelt 1994), the WordNet database (Fellbaum\n1998), as well as the connectionist models of Seidenberg &\nMcClelland (1989), Hinton & Shallice (1991), and Plaut &\nShallice (1993). More on this in the entry on\n connectionism.\n\nFinally, statistical analysis investigates word meaning by examining\nthrough computational means the distribution of words in linguistic\ncorpora. The main idea is to use quantitative data about the frequency\nof co-occurrence of sets of lexical items to identify their semantic\nproperties and differentiate their different senses (for overviews,\nsee Atkins & Zampolli 1994; Manning & Sch\u00fctze 1999;\nStubbs 2002; Sinclair 2004). Notice that while symbolic networks are\nmodels of the architecture of the lexicon that seek to be\npsychologically adequate (i.e., to reveal how knowledge of word\nmeaning is stored and organized in the mind/brain of human speakers),\nstatistical approaches to word meaning are not necessarily interested\nin psychological adequacy, and may have completely different goals,\nsuch as building a machine translation service able to mimic human\nperformance (a goal that can obviously be achieved without reproducing\nthe cognitive mechanisms underlying translation in humans). More on\nthis in the entry on\n computational linguistics.\n",
