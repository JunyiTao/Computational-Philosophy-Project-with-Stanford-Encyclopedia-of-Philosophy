Emergentism\n\nIn the last chapter of his monumental The Mind and Its Place in\nNature Broad defends an Emergentist position with respect to the\nrelation between mind and matter: mental properties are, in his\nopinion, distinct from physical properties; they are properties that\nemerge when neurophysiological processes have attained a\nsufficiently high degree of complexity. His discussion and defense of\nEmergentism features two chief elements. Firstly, there is a\nmeticulous examination of the concept of emergence as such; secondly,\nthere is a discussion of whether there is reason to think that\nemergent phenomena actually exist.\n",
