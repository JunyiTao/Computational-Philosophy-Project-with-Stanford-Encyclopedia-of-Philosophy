    "main_text": "The middle dialogues: Justice and other virtues || The quest for method\n3.4 The quest for method\n\r\nWhat is remarkable in the Phaedrus\u2019 depiction of the\r\nuplifting effect of beauty is not only its exuberant tone and imagery,\r\nwhich goes far beyond the Symposium\u2019s unadorned\r\nscala amoris, but also its intricate interweaving of mythical\r\nand philosophical elements. For, in the midst of his fanciful depiction\r\nof the different fates that are in store for different kinds of souls,\r\nPlato specifies, in quite technical terms, that the capacity \u201cto\r\nunderstand speech in terms of general Forms, proceeding to bring many\r\nperceptions together into a reasoned unity\u201d (249b\u2013c:\r\nsynienai kat\u2019 eidos legomenon, ...eis hen\r\nlogism\u00f4i synairoumenon), is the condition for the\r\nreincarnation of individual souls as human beings. It is this capacity\r\nfor abstract thought that he then calls \u201crecollection of what\r\nthe soul saw when it was travelling with god, when it disregarded the\r\nthings we now call real and lifted up its head to what is truly real\r\ninstead.\u201d The heavenly adventure now seems to amount to no more\r\nthan the employment of the dialectical method that Socrates is going\r\nto describe, without further mythical camouflage, in the\r\ndialogue\u2019s second part. The ability to work out a taxonomy,\r\nestablishing the unity in a given subject-matter and dividing it up\r\naccording to its natural kinds, is the art that characterizes the\r\n\u2018scientific rhetorician\u2019 (265d\u2013266b). Socrates\r\nprofesses the greatest veneration for such a master: \u201cIf I\r\nbelieve that someone is capable of discerning a single thing that is\r\nalso by nature capable of encompassing many, I follow \u2018straight\r\nbehind, in his tracks, as if he were a god\u2019.\u201d So the\r\nheavenly voyage has a quite down-to-earth counterpart in the\r\ndialectical method \u2013 a method that Plato regards as a\r\n\u2018gift of the gods\u2019, as he is going to confirm in the\r\nPhilebus (16c). At the same time, Plato\u2019s esteem for\r\ntaxonomy explains the inner unity of the Phaedrus\u2019\r\nseemingly incongruous two parts as two sides of one coin, and it also\r\nshows why Plato no longer treats the sensory as a mere distraction and\r\ndisturbance of the mind. Instead, the properly conditioned\r\nsouls\u2019 sensory impressions are its first incentives to seek the\r\nhigher and better.\n\r\nWhat concept of happiness is suggested by this \u2018divinely\r\ninspired\u2019 view of human life? Individuals do not, here, find\r\ntheir fulfillment in peaceful interactions in a harmonious community.\r\nInstead, life is spent in the perennial pursuit of the higher and\r\nbetter. But, in that task, the individual is not alone; she shares it\r\nwith kindred spirits. The message of both the Symposium and\r\nthe Phaedrus is, therefore, two-pronged. On the one hand, there\r\nis no permanent attainment of happiness as a stable state of\r\ncompletion in this life. In the ups and downs of life (and of the\r\nafterlife), humans are in constant need of beauty as an incentive to\r\naim for self-perfection. Humans are neither god-like nor wise; at\r\nbest, they are god-lovers and philosophers, demonic hunters for truth\r\nand goodness. To know is not to have, and to have once is not to have\r\nforever. In the Symposium, Diotima states in no uncertain\r\nterms that humans have a perennial need to replenish what they\r\nconstantly lose, both in body and soul, because they are mortal and\r\nchangeable creatures, and the Phaedrus confirms the need for\r\ncontinued efforts because the heavenly voyage is not a one-time\r\naffair. On the other hand, there is also the message conveyed that the\r\npursuit of the good and the beautiful is not a lonely enterprise. As\r\nindicated in the Symposium and further elaborated in the\r\nPhaedrus, love for a beautiful human being is an incentive to\r\nsearch for a higher form of life, a sacred joint journey of two\r\nfriends in communion (255a\u2013256e). The need for, and also the\r\npossibility of, constant self-repletion and -perfection is a motive\r\nthat will reappear in the ethical thought of Plato\u2019s late works,\r\na motif he sometimes presents as the maxim that humans should aim at\r\nthe \u2018likening of oneself to god\u2019 (homoi\u00f4sis\r\nthe\u00f4i in Theaetetus 176b; Timaeus\r\n90c).\n\r\nSober philosophers have a tendency to ignore such visionary talk as a\r\nkind of Schw\u00e4rmerei that lacks the substance to be worth\r\nserious thought. That Plato, appearances notwithstanding, is not\r\nindulging in a god-besotted r\u00eaverie in the\r\nPhaedrus is indicated by his interweaving of the mythical\r\ndepiction in the dialogue\u2019s first part with his specification\r\nand exploration of the dialectical method in the later part\r\n(259e-279c), where Socrates attempts to determine the requirements of\r\n\u2018scientific rhetoric\u2019 (259e\u2013279c). Artful speaking,\r\nas well as artful deception, presupposes knowledge of the truth,\r\nespecially where the identity of the phenomena is difficult to grasp,\r\nbecause similarities can be misleading. This applies in particular to\r\nconcepts like the good and the just, as witnessed by the wide\r\ndisagreement about their nature (263a\u2013c). The development of the\r\n\u2018sharp eye\u2019 that is needed to assign each object to the\r\nright class is the aim of Plato\u2019s method of collection and\r\ndivision, a method on which he expounds at some length in the\r\nPhaedrus. He discusses the care that is needed in order to\r\n\u201csee together things that are scattered about everywhere, and to\r\ncollect them into one kind (mia idea)\u201d, as well as\r\n\u201cto cut the unity up again according to its species along its\r\nnatural joints, and to try not to splinter any part, as a bad butcher\r\nmight do (265d\u2013e).\u201d That this method is supposed to serve\r\nan overall ethical purpose is confirmed by the fact that rhetoric\r\nbased on truth must reflect the speaker\u2019s knowledge not only of\r\nthe different types of souls and the types of speech that fit them\r\n(271d) but also of the truth about just and good things (272d).\n\r\nThat dialectic is geared to this end is somewhat obscured in the\r\nsubsequent discussion in the Phaedrus. First of all, Plato\r\nturns away from this issue in his long depiction of the iniquities of\r\ncontemporary rhetoricians when he contrasts their efforts with that\r\nof the scientific rhetorician. And Plato continues this excursion with\r\na discussion of speaking and writing, culminating in his famous\r\n\u2018critique of writing\u2019. Second, although Plato makes ample\r\nuse of the method of collection and division in later dialogues such\r\nas the Sophist and the Statesman, he seems to pay\r\nlittle heed there to problems of ethics, with the exception of the\r\nPhilebus. But the aptness of the dialectical method in\r\ndiscerning the nature of the good has already been emphasized in the\r\nRepublic (534b\u2013c): \u201cUnless someone can\r\ndistinguish in an account the Form of the Good from everything else,\r\ncan survive all refutation as if in battle... you will say that he\r\ndoes not know the good itself or any other good.\u201d Brief as these\r\nremarks are, they show that the application of dialectic is of central\r\nimportance to the understanding and pursuit of the good. That the good\r\nis nowhere subjected to such treatment must be due to the enormity of\r\nthe task involved in undertaking a systematic identification of all\r\nthat is good and in working out the criteria of distinction. Although\r\nit is unclear whether Plato in the Republic had already\r\nrefined the dialectical method in the systematic way indicated in the\r\nPhaedrus, the hints contained about a \u2018longer\r\nway\u2019 (435d; 504b) to determine the nature of justice and that of\r\nthe other virtues suggest that the development of a systematic method\r\nof collection and division was at least \u2018in the works\u2019. As\r\na closer look at the much later Philebus will show, the\r\ndetermination of what is good about each kind of thing presupposes\r\nmore than a classification by collection and division: the internal\r\nstructure of each kind of entity has also to be determined. Knowledge\r\nis not confined to the comprehension of the objects\u2019 being,\r\nidentity, difference and other interrelations that exist in a given\r\nfield. It also presupposes the knowledge of what constitutes the\r\nobjects\u2019 internal unity and complexity. It would, of course, be\r\nrather presumptuous to claim that Plato had not seen the need to\r\ninvestigate the ontological \u2018anatomy\u2019, as well as the\r\ntaxonomy, of the Forms from early on. But as the late dialogues show,\r\nit took him quite some effort to develop the requisite conceptual\r\ntools for such analyses.\n\r\nBefore we turn to the late dialogues, a final review is in order of\r\nthe kind of good life that Plato envisages in the dialogues\r\nunder discussion here. In the Symposium, the emphasis is on\r\nthe individual\u2019s creative work, which involves others at least\r\nas catalysts in one\u2019s efforts to attain self-perpetuation and\r\nself-perfection. The quality of life attainable by each person\r\ndiffers depending on the kind of \u2018work\u2019 each individual\r\nis able to produce. This is what the scala amoris is all\r\nabout. In the Phaedrus, the emphasis is on the \u2018joint\r\nventure\u2019 of two kindred souls. True friends will get to the\r\nhighest point of self-fulfillment through the joint insights that they\r\nattain. Just as in the Symposium, the philosophical life is\r\ndeemed the best. But then, this preference is found everywhere in\r\nPlato, and it is not unique to him: All ancient philosophers regard\r\ntheir own occupation as the true fulfillment of human nature \u2013\r\nas they saw it. If there are differences between them, they concern\r\nthe kinds of study and occupation that they deemed appropriate for the\r\nphilosopher. The more individualistic view of happiness espoused in\r\nthe Symposium and in the Phaedrus need, however, not\r\nbe seen as a later stage in Plato\u2019s development than the\r\nRepublic\u2019s communitarian conception. They may present\r\ncomplementary, rather than rival, points of view, and no fixed\r\nchronology need be assumed in order to accommodate both.\n4. The late dialogues: Ethics and Cosmology\n4.1 Harmony and cosmic goodness\n\r\nMost modern readers of Plato tend to ignore the significance of\r\nPlato\u2019s late dialogues for his ethical views, for late dialogues\r\nsuch as the Timaeus appear to concentrate on nature and\r\nmetaphysics \u2014 and, for the most part, drop questions such as the\r\nnature of the virtues and the moral psychology of the soul. This\r\nappears to be a shift in emphasis since nature and natural things are\r\nnot among the objects that concern Plato in his earlier and middle\r\nphilosophical investigations. Thus, in the Republic, he\r\ndismisses the study of the visible heaven from the curriculum of\r\nhigher learning, along with the study of audible music. But, such\r\ngeneralizations about Plato\u2019s intentions may be misleading. What\r\nhe denigrates is not the study of the heavenly order as such or that\r\nof harmonics; it is, rather, the extent to which humans must necessarily\r\nrely on their eyes and ears in those concerns. Students of philosophy\r\nare, rather, encouraged to work out the true intelligible order\r\nunderlying the visible heaven and audible music. Not only that: The\r\nascent out of the Cave does include recognition of objects outside,\r\nespecially \u201cthe things in the sky\u201d (R.\r\n516a\u2013b). If Plato is critical of natural science, it is because\r\nof its empirical approach. This echoes the Phaedo\u2019s\r\ncomplaint that one ruins one\u2019s eyes by looking directly at\r\nthings, most of all at the sun (Phdo. 99d\u2013e), while\r\nignoring the \u2018binding force\u2019 of the good. But what kind of\r\n\u2018binding force\u2019 does Plato attribute to \u2018the\r\nGood\u2019? His reticence about this concept, despite its centrality\r\nin his metaphysics and ethics, is largely responsible for the\r\nobscurity of his concept of happiness and of what it is to lead a good\r\nlife. The philosophers\u2019 knowledge supposedly provides a solid\r\nbasis for the good life of the entire community, as well as for that\r\nof the \u2013 perhaps uncomprehending \u2013 majority, because all\r\nbenefit from the good order of the state. But what is \u2018the\r\nGood\u2019 that is responsible for the goodness of all other things?\r\nA lot of ink has been spilt over the following passage in\r\nRepublic book VI, 509b: \u201cNot only do the objects of\r\nknowledge owe their being known to the Good, but their\r\nbeing (ousia) is also due to it, although the Good\r\nis not being, but beyond it (epekeina) in rank and\r\npower.\u201d The analogy with the sun\u2019s maintenance of all that\r\nis alive suggests that the Good is the intelligent inner principle\r\nthat determines the nature of every object that is capable of\r\ngoodness, in the sense that these objects fulfill their respective\r\nfunctions in the appropriate way. Plato does not attempt to state how\r\nsuch a principle of goodness works in all things in the\r\nRepublic, nor does he indicate whether he has in mind a\r\nunifying principle in a strong sense. That he is indeed thinking of an\r\ninternal \u2018binding force\u2019 for all kinds of things is\r\nindicated, however, in Book X, in his elucidation of the ontological\r\ndifferences that exist, respectively, between the Forms as the\r\nproducts of a divine maker, their earthly copies, and the imitation of\r\nthese copies by an artist (R. 596a ff.). According to Plato,\r\nin each case, it is the use or function that\r\ndetermines what it is to be good (601d): \u201cAren\u2019t the\r\nvirtue or excellence, the beauty and correctness of each manufactured\r\nitem, living creature, and action related to nothing but the use\r\n(chreia) for which each is made or naturally adapted?\u201d\r\nGiven that Plato does not limit this account to tools or instruments\r\nbut explicitly includes living things and human actions, he seems to\r\nhave a specific criterion in mind for what constitutes each\r\nthing\u2019s excellence. But what determines the \u2018use\u2019 of\r\na human being, and to what extent can there be a common principle that\r\naccounts for all good things? In the Republic, this question\r\nis answered only indirectly through the isomorphism of the just state\r\nand the just soul, based on a harmonious internal order. The postulate\r\nof such an orderly structure is not explicitly extended beyond the\r\nstate and the soul. In the later dialogues, by contrast, the Good\r\nclearly operates on a cosmic scale. That such is Plato\u2019s view\r\ncomes to the fore in his excursus on the philosopher\u2019s nature in\r\nthe Theaetetus (173c\u2013177c). Contrary to Socrates\u2019\r\ndenial in the Apology, Socrates in the Theaetetus\r\naffirms that the philosopher is to pursue both \u201cwhat lies below\r\nthe earth and the heights above the heaven\u201d (173e):\r\n\u201ctracking down by every path the entire nature of each whole\r\namong the things that are.\u201d And Socrates also concerns himself\r\nthere with the question of \u201cWhat is man? What actions and\r\npassions properly belong to human nature and distinguish it from all\r\nother beings?\u201d In that connection, he compares the discovery of\r\ntruth with \u2018likening oneself to God\u2019 (homoi\u00f4sis\r\nthe\u00f4i) and indicates that there is a unitary principle of\r\ngoodness. The ability to achieve this superhuman state depends on\r\none\u2019s readiness to engage in strenuous philosophical discourse\r\n(177b).\n\r\nIf, in the Republic, the goodness of the individual soul is\r\nexplained in terms of its being a smaller copy of a harmonious\r\nsociety, in the Timaeus, Plato goes for an even larger model.\r\nThe universe and its soul now supply the \u2018large text\u2019 for\r\ndeciphering the nature of the human soul. The structure of the\r\nworld-soul is replicated in the nature of the human soul. That there\r\nis, nevertheless, a close affinity between the Republic and\r\nthe cosmological project that Plato means to pursue in the\r\nTimaeus and its intended sequel is clearly indicated in the\r\npreface to the Timaeus. The tale of the origin of the\r\nuniverse, including human nature, is presented as the first step\r\ntowards fulfilling Socrates\u2019 wish to see his own best city\r\n\u2018in action\u2019 (Ti. 19b\u2013c). From antiquity on,\r\nthis introduction has created the impression that the Timaeus\r\nis the direct continuation of the Republic, an impression\r\nthat explains its juxtaposition in the Corpus Platonicum.\r\nStrong indications speak, however, for a much later date of the\r\nTimaeus. If Plato establishes a link between these two works,\r\nhis intent is to compare as well as to contrast. The continuity\r\nconsists solely in the fact that Socrates reaffirms his adherence to\r\nhis ideal city\u2019s order \u2013 at least in principle\r\n(Ti. 17c\u201319b). It is this order that Critias promises\r\nto illustrate by a narration of the tale of two cities, of the war\r\nbetween pre-historic Athens, a city that exemplifies the ideal order,\r\nand Atlantis, a powerful tyrannical superpower (Ti.\r\n20d\u201326e). However, Plato never completed this project: The\r\nCritias breaks off after some 15 Stephanus-pages, in\r\nmid-sentence, and the third dialogue in the series,\r\nHermocrates, whatever was to have been its content, was never\r\nwritten at all. So, the story of Socrates\u2019 ideal city in\r\naction and of the life of its citizens remains untold. All we\r\nhave is Plato\u2019s cosmic model for such a state and the soul of\r\nits inhabitants (on Plato\u2019s cosmology, see the entry\r\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus by Donald Zeyl and Barbara Sattler in\r\nSEP).\n\r\nA crucial difference between the philosophical approach in the\r\nRepublic and that in the Timaeus lies in the fact\r\nthat, in the latter dialogue, Plato concerns himself with the structure\r\nof the visible heaven as a model for the human soul and also with the\r\nmaterial conditions of human physiology. What is confined to mythology\r\nin Plato\u2019s earlier works is here worked out \u2013 though not\r\nwithout a caveat to the effect that Plato is merely offering\r\na likely story rather than a scientific explanation of the\r\nstructure of the universe, of the human soul, and of human physiology.\r\nPlato\u2019s choice of presenting his explanation of the order of the\r\nuniverse as a story of creation by a so-called demiurge or\r\n\u2018divine workman\u2019 is certainly no accident. It can be\r\nunderstood as a kind of \u2018retractation\u2019 of his deprecatory\r\ndepiction of the divine workman\u2019s heavenly embroidery in\r\nRepublic VII 528e-530d, where such a product is depreciated\r\nbecause of its inferiority to a model conceivable in theory. To be\r\nsure, the Timaeus presupposes the Forms as the divine\r\nworkman\u2019s unchanging models, and he resorts to mathematical\r\nprinciples to explain the cosmic order (27d\u201329d; 30c\u201331b),\r\nbut the focus is almost exclusively on the construction of the visible\r\nheavens. Plato now seems to have convinced himself that in order to\r\nexplain the nature of a living being, it is necessary to show what\r\nfactors constitute such a live organism.\n\r\nThis intention explains certain peculiarities of the Timaeus\r\nthat make the dialogue hard to penetrate, for it falls into three\r\nrather disparate parts. The first part describes the structure of the\r\nworld-soul and its replication in the human soul in a way that\r\ncombines the general principles with those of mathematics and\r\nharmonics and illustrates it with fantastic imagery (29d\u201347e).\r\nThe second part consists of a rather meticulous account of the\r\nelementary corporeal constituents of nature, which are supposedly\r\nformed out of geometrically constructed atoms (47e\u201369a). The\r\nthird part combines elements from the first and second parts in a\r\nlengthy explanation of human physiology and psychology\r\n(69b\u201392c). The first, cosmological, part of the Timaeus\r\ngreatly taxes one\u2019s ability to relate the notion of a divinely\r\ncreated world-soul to the motions of the visible heavens because\r\nPlato offers only the barest hints concerning the intelligible,\r\nmathematical, and harmonic structure that is to explain these motions.\r\nBy contrast, the explanations in the second and third parts are hard to\r\nfollow because of Plato\u2019s quite unique concern with the\r\nstructure and the dynamics of the basic elements of the physical world\r\nin general and with that of human physiology in particular.\n\r\nBut why does Plato burden himself and his readers with such a complex\r\nmachinery, and what does this heavenly instrument have to do with\r\nethics? Since the human soul is formed out of the same ingredients as\r\nthe world soul (albeit of a less pure kind) and displays the same\r\nstructure (41d\u2013e), Plato is clearly not just concerned with the\r\norder of the universe but with that of the human soul as well. He\r\nattributes to it the possession of the kinds of concepts that are\r\nnecessary for the understanding of the nature of all things, both\r\neternal and temporal. The soul\u2019s ingredients are here limited to\r\nthe purely general concepts and to mathematical proportions. There is\r\nno reference to a theory of recollection of the nature of all things.\r\nRather, Plato is concerned to ascertain that the soul has all the\r\ntools for dealing with all objects: (1) the most important concepts\r\nnecessary for the identification and the differentiations in the way\r\nrequired for dialectical procedure; (2) the numbers and proportions\r\nneeded to understand numerical relations and harmonic structures of\r\nall sorts; (3) the capacity of the soul to perform and comprehend\r\nharmoniously coordinated motions. This, it seems, is all the soul\r\nneeds and all it gets so that it can perform its various tasks. The\r\nunusual depiction of the soul\u2019s elements and composition makes\r\nit hard, at first, to penetrate to the rationale of its construction,\r\nand it must remain an open question to what extent Plato expects his\r\nmodel to be taken in a literal rather than in a figurative sense. His\r\noverall message should be clear, however: The soul is a\r\nharmoniously structured entity that can, in principle, function\r\nforever, and it also comprehends the corresponding structures\r\nof other entities and, therefore, has access to all that is good and\r\nharmonious. This last point has consequences for his ethical thought\r\nthat are not developed in the Timaeus itself, but that can be\r\ndetected in some of the other late dialogues.\n4.2 Measure for Measure\n\r\nPlato\u2019s concern with \u2018right measure\u2019 in a sense that\r\nis relevant for ethics is, of course, not confined to his late work.\r\nIt shows up rather early. Already in the Gorgias, Socrates\r\nblames Callicles for the undisciplined state of his soul and\r\nattributes it to his neglect of geometry (508a): \u201cYou\u2019ve\r\nfailed to notice that proportionate equality (geometrik\u00ea\r\nisot\u00eas) has great power among both gods and men.\u201d But\r\nit is unclear whether this expression is to be taken in a more than\r\nmetaphorical sense; it is, at any rate, not repeated anywhere else in\r\nPlato\u2019s earlier work. There is also no indication that Plato\r\ntakes seriously the idea of a \u2018quantification\u2019 of the\r\nnature of the virtues in his middle dialogues. If mathematics looms\r\nlarge, then, it is as a model science on account of its exactness, the\r\nstability of its objects, and their accessibility to reason. A\r\nsystematic exploration of the notion that measure and proportion are\r\nthe fundamental conditions of goodness is confined to the late\r\ndialogues. Apart from the Timaeus\u2019 emphasis on a\r\nprecise cosmic and mental order, there is a crucial passage in the\r\nStatesman (283d\u2013285c), where the Eleatic Stranger\r\ndistinguishes two kinds of \u2018art of measurement\u2019. The first\r\nkind is the ordinary measuring of quantities relative to each other\r\n(\u2018the great and small\u2019). The second kind has a normative\r\ncomponent: It is concerned with the determination of \u2018due\r\nmeasure\u2019 (to metrion). The latter is treated with great\r\nconcern, for the Eleatic Stranger claims that it is the basis of all\r\nexpertise, including statesmanship, the very art that is the subject\r\nof that dialogue (284a\u2013b): \u201cIt is by preserving measure in\r\nthis way that they produce all the good and fine things they do\r\nproduce.\u201d His point is that all good productions and all\r\nprocesses of generation that come to a good end presuppose\r\n\u2018right measure\u2019, while arbitrary quantities (\u2018the\r\nmore and less\u2019) have no such results. The Eleatic Stranger\r\ntherefore suggests a separation of the simple arts of measuring from\r\nthe arts concerned with due measure (284e): \u201cPositing as one\r\npart all those sorts of expertise that measure the numbers, lengths,\r\ndepths, breadths and speeds of things in relation to what is opposed\r\nto them, and as the other, all those that measure in relation to what\r\nis in due measure (to metrion), what is fitting (to\r\nprepon), the right moment (to kairion), what is as it\r\nought to be (to deon) \u2013 everything that is removed from\r\nthe extremes to the middle (meson).\u201d This distinction\r\nfinds no application in the Statesman itself, except that due\r\nmeasure must be presupposed in the final definition of the statesman\r\nas a \u2018kingly weaver\u2019, weaving together the fabric of the\r\nstate by combining the aggressive and the moderate temperaments in the\r\npopulation so as to produce a harmonious citizenry (305e\u2013 311c).\r\nBut no mathematic procedure is specified as the condition of such a\r\n\u2018mixing together of the citizens\u2019 characters\u2019 in due\r\nmeasure.\n\r\nThe importance of \u2018measure\u2019 in a seemingly literal sense\r\nis made explicit; however, in the Philebus, the dialogue that\r\nis concerned with the question of whether pleasure or knowledge is the\r\nstate of mind that constitutes happiness. In that dialogue, number\r\n(arithmos), limit (peras), and measure\r\n(metron) play a crucial role at various points of the\r\ndiscussion, and the Philebus is also the dialogue where Plato\r\nrequires that numerical precision must be observed in the application\r\nof the \u2018divine gift\u2019 of the dialectical procedure of\r\ncollection and division (16c\u201317a). The dialectician must know\r\nprecisely how many species and subspecies a certain genus contains;\r\notherwise, he has no claim to any kind of expertise. Despite this\r\nemphasis on precision and on the need to determine the numerical\r\n\u2018limit\u2019 in every science, Socrates does not provide the\r\nenvisaged kind of collection and division of pleasure and knowledge.\r\nHe avoids that task with the pretense that he suddenly remembers that\r\nneither of the two contenders suffices in itself for the happy life\r\nand that a mixture of the two is preferable. To explain the nature of\r\nthis mixture, Socrates introduces a fourfold division of all beings\r\n(23c\u201327c), a division that uses the categories of\r\n\u2018limit\u2019 and \u2018measure\u2019 in a different way than\r\nthe one suggested earlier for the \u2018divine method of\r\ndialectic\u2019. Limit now concerns the objects\u2019 internal\r\nstructure. As Socrates states, all beings belong in one of four\r\nclasses \u2013 namely (1) limit (peras), (2) the unlimited\r\n(apeiron), (3) the mixture (meixis) of limit and the\r\nunlimited, or (4) the cause (aitia) of such a mixture. As the\r\nsubsequent explications concerning the four classes show, the\r\nunlimited comprises all those things that have no exact measure or\r\ngrade in themselves, such as what is hotter and colder, faster and\r\nslower. Although at first the examples are confined to relative terms,\r\nthe class of the unlimited is then extended to things like hot and\r\ncold, dry and moist, fast and slow, and even heat and frost, i.e., to\r\nall that has no fixed limit or degree. Mixture takes place when such\r\nqualities take on a definite quantity (poson) or due measure\r\n(metrion) that puts a definite limit on their variety. That\r\nonly measured entities qualify as mixtures is not only suggested by\r\nthe examples Socrates refers to (health, strength, beauty, music, and\r\nthe seasons) but by his assertion, later in the dialogue, that a\r\nmixture without due measure or proportion does not deserve its name\r\n(64d\u2013e): \u201cit will necessarily corrupt its ingredients and\r\nmost of all itself. For there would be no blending in such cases at\r\nall but only an unconnected medley, the ruin of whatever happens to be\r\ncontained in it.\u201d The upshot of this discussion is that all\r\nstable entities represent a harmonious equilibrium of their otherwise\r\nlimitless ingredients. Since indeterminate elements usually turn up in\r\npairs of opposites, the right limit in each case must be the right\r\nproportion necessary for their balance. In the case of health, there\r\nwill be the right balance between the hot and the cold, the dry and\r\nthe moist. The cause of the proper proportion for each mixture turns\r\nout to be reason; it is the only member of the fourth class.\r\nAs Socrates indicates, divine reason is the ultimate source of all\r\nthat is good and harmonious in the universe, while human reason\r\nconstitutes order down here (26e\u201327c; 28a\u201330e).\n\r\nThe adoption of this fourfold ontology allows Socrates to assign\r\npleasure and knowledge to two of the four classes of being: Pleasure\r\nturns out to be unlimited because it admits of the \u2018more and\r\nless\u2019. Reason, by contrast, belongs to the fourth class, to the\r\ncauses of good mixtures. On the basis of this classification, Socrates\r\nprovides the criteria for a critical assessment of the different kinds\r\nof pleasure and knowledge (31b\u201359d) and presents happiness as a\r\nmixture of all kinds of knowledge with true and pure kinds of pleasure\r\n(59d-64b). In a final \u2018ranking of goods\u2019, measure and due\r\nproportion, unsurprisingly, get the first rank among the possessions\r\nof the soul, things in proper proportion come in second, reason is\r\nranked third, the arts and sciences obtain fourth place, whereas the\r\ntrue and pure pleasures get fifth and last place on the scale of goods\r\n(64c\u201367b). If Plato in the Philebus is more favorably\r\ndisposed towards a hedonist stance than in some of his earlier works,\r\nhe is so only to a quite limited degree: He regards pleasure as a\r\nnecessary ingredient in human life because both the physical and the\r\npsychic equilibria that constitute human nature are unstable. In a\r\nsense that recalls the Symposium, Plato presupposes that\r\nthere is always some deficiency or lack that needs\r\nsupplementation. Because the range of such \u2018supplements\u2019\r\nincludes learning and the pursuit of the virtues, there are some\r\npleasures that are rightly cherished. But even they are deemed goods\r\nonly insofar as they are a compensation for human imperfection.\n\r\nGiven the importance of \u2018measure\u2019, there is the question\r\nof how serious Plato is about such a \u2018mathematization\u2019 of\r\nhis principles, quite generally. Though harmony and order have been\r\ntreated as important principles in Plato\u2019s metaphysics and\r\nethics from early on, in his late dialogues, he seems to envisage right\r\nmeasure in a literal sense. This explains his confidence that even\r\nphysical entities can attain a relatively stable state. As he suggests\r\nboth in the Timaeus and in the Philebus, not\r\neverything is in a constant flux. On the contrary, those things that\r\npossess the measures that are right for their type are stable entities\r\nand can be the objects of \u2018firm and true beliefs and\r\nconvictions\u2019 (Ti. 37b\u2013c). This applies not only\r\nto the nature of the visible universe but also to the human body and\r\nmind. Plato seems to have felt encouraged to embrace such theories by\r\nthe advances of astronomy and harmonics in his own lifetime so that\r\nhe postulates \u2018due proportion\u2019 in an arithmetical sense as\r\nthe cause of all harmony and stability.\n\r\nPlato\u2019s confidence seems to have extended not only to the\r\nphysical but also to the moral state of human nature. That assumption\r\nis confirmed not only by the emphasis on right mixture in the\r\nPhilebus but also by the discussion in the Laws\r\nabout how the laws are to achieve peace in the state and harmony in\r\nthe souls of the citizens. Plato no longer treats the emotions as a\r\nmenace to the virtues; rather, he assigns to the legislators the task\r\nof providing for an adequate balance of pleasure and pain by\r\nhabituating the citizens in the right way (632a\u2013643a). This\r\nbalance, through paideia, is crucial for maintaining a truly\r\nliberal soul (I 636e): \u201cPleasure and pain flow like two springs\r\nreleased by nature. If a man draws the right amount from the right\r\nspring at the right time, he lives a happy life.\u201d Suffice it to\r\nnote that the comments concerning the right measure of pleasure and\r\npain form the preface to the entire project. That there is a\r\nconsiderable re-evaluation of the emotions in the Laws,\r\ncompared to that in the Republic, is confirmed by the fact\r\nthat, according to Laws II, education is supposed to provide\r\nthe citizens with the right habituation (\u0115thos)\r\nconcerning the measure of pleasure and pain. The function assigned,\r\nthere, to the right measure of pleasure and pain in the\r\ncitizens\u2019 sentimental education clearly anticipates the\r\nAristotelian conception of the moral virtues as the right mean between\r\nexcess and deficiency (II 653b\u2013c): \u201cVirtue is this general\r\nconcord of reason and emotion. But there is one element you could\r\nisolate in any account you give, and this is the correct formation of\r\nour feelings of pleasure and pain, which makes us hate what we ought\r\nto hate from first to last, and love what we ought to love.\u201d The\r\nconfidence expressed in the Laws in the power of due measure\r\nculminates in the famous maxim that God (rather than Protagoras\u2019\r\nMan) is the measure of all things (IV 716c\u2013d): \u201cIn our\r\nview, it is God who is preeminently the \u2018measure of all\r\nthings\u2019, much more so than any man, as they say. So if you want\r\nto recommend yourself to someone of this character, you must do your\r\nlevel best to make your own character reflect his, and on this\r\nprinciple the moderate man is God\u2019s friend, being like him,\r\nwhereas the immoderate and unjust man is not like him and is his\r\nenemy; and the same reasoning applies to the other vices too.\u201d\r\nBut because Plato, like Aristotle after him, carefully refrains from\r\nany kind of specifications of concrete right measures, we should treat\r\nthe \u2018arithmetic\u2019 of the good life with a pinch of salt.\r\nThat individuals differ in their internal and external conditions is\r\nas clear to Plato as it is to Aristotle. This does not shake\r\nPlato\u2019s faith in the Laws that right habituation\r\nthrough the right kind of education, most of all in the arts, will\r\nprovide the necessary inner equilibrium in the soul of the good\r\ncitizen.\n\r\nAre Plato\u2019s views of human nature and the human good more\r\nsympathetic to democratic standards in his last works? If we look at\r\nthe requirements in the Timaeus concerning the good state of\r\nthe human soul in \u2018orderly circles\u2019, Plato seems to remain\r\nas demanding and elitist as ever. But he no longer puts so much\r\nemphasis on the distance between the best and the ordinary. As he\r\nremarks in the Statesman, statesmen don\u2019t stick out\r\nfrom the rest of humankind in mind and body like the queen-bees do in\r\nthe hive (301d-e). Further, even the best of the souls of human beings\r\nare far inferior to the world-soul, because, in the case of human souls,\r\ntheir \u2018incorporation\u2019 means disorder that subsides only\r\ngradually (Ti. 42e-44c). That this applies to all human\r\nbeings suggests that Plato has become more democratic in the sense\r\nthat he regards the \u2018human herd\u2019 as a more uniform flock\r\nthan he did in his earlier days. He retains the conviction, however,\r\nthat a well-ordered soul is the prerequisite of the good life and that\r\nhuman beings stand in need not only of a careful moral education but\r\nalso of a well-regulated life. Whether a life in Plato\u2019s\r\nnomocracy would better please modern minds than a life ruled by\r\nphilosopher-kings is a question that would require a careful perusal\r\nof that enormous compendium of regulations and laws, which makes the\r\ntask of reading and understanding the Laws very hard work.\r\nBut that compendium is at the same time a valuable sourcebook for all\r\nthose interested in Plato\u2019s late moral thought (for a more\r\ndetailed evaluation of the Laws, see the entry Plato on\r\nUtopia in SEP by Chris Bobonich and Katherine\r\nMeadows).\nGlossary\n\naccount: logos\nappetitive part: \u00e9pithumetikon\nart: techn\u00ea\nbeing: ousia\ncause: aitia\nconsonance: sumphonia\ncourage: andreia\ndifference: heteron\neducation: paideia\nenthusiasm: enthusiasmos\nexcellence: aret\u00ea\nform: eidos, idea\nfunction: ergon\nhabit: ethos\nhappiness: eudaimonia\nharmony: harmonia\nkind: eidos, idea\njustice: dikaiosun\u00ea\nlikening to god: homoi\u00f4sis the\u00f4\nlimit: peras\nlook: idea\nlove: er\u00f4s\nmadness, divine: theia mania\nmeasure: metron; metrion\nmixture: meixis\nmodel: paradeigma\nmoderation: s\u00f4phrosun\u00ea\nneed: endeia; chreia\nnumber: arithmos\norder: kosmos\nperplexity: aporia\nquantity: poson\nrational part: logistikon\nreason: nous\nreasoning: logos\nrecollection: anamn\u00easis\nrefutation: elenchos\nsameness: tauton\nself-mastery: egkrateia\nself-sufficiency: autarkeia\nsoul: psuch\u00ea\nsort: eidos, idea\nspirited part: thumoeides\nsteadfastness: s\u00f4t\u00earia\nunlimited: apeiron\nvirtue: aret\u00ea\nweakness of the will: akrasia\nwisdom: sophia\n",
