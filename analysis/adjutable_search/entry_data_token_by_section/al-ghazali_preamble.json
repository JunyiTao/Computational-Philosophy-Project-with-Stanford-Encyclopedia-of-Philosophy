    "main_text": "\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee (c.1056\u20131111) was one of the\nmost prominent and influential philosophers, theologians, jurists, and\nmystics of Sunni Islam. He was active at a time when Sunni theology\nhad just passed through its consolidation and entered a period of\nintense challenges from Shiite Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelite theology\nand the Arabic tradition of Aristotelian philosophy\n(falsafa). Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee understood the importance\nof falsafa and developed a complex response that rejected and\ncondemned some of its teachings, while it also allowed him to accept\nand apply others. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s critique of twenty\npositions of falsafa in his Incoherence of the\nPhilosophers (Tah\u00e2fut al-fal\u00e2sifa) is a\nsignificant landmark in the history of philosophy as it advances the\nnominalist critique of Aristotelian science developed later in 14th\ncentury Europe. On the Arabic and Muslim side\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s acceptance of demonstration\n(apodeixis) led to a much more refined and precise discourse\non epistemology and a flowering of Aristotelian logics and\nmetaphysics. With al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee begins the successful\nintroduction of Aristotelianism or rather Avicennism into Muslim\ntheology. After a period of appropriation of the Greek sciences in the\ntranslation movement from Greek into Arabic and the writings of the\nfal\u00e2sifa up to Avicenna (Ibn S\u00een\u00e2,\nc.980\u20131037), philosophy and the Greek sciences were\n\u201cnaturalized\u201d into the discourse of kal\u00e2m\nand Muslim theology (Sabra 1987). Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s\napproach to resolving apparent contradictions between reason and\nrevelation was accepted by almost all later Muslim theologians and\nhad, via the works of Averroes (Ibn Rushd, 1126\u201398) and Jewish\nauthors, a significant influence on Latin medieval thinking.\n",
