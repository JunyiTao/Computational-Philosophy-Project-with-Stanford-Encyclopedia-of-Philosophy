    "main_text": "The Buddhist account of the emotions || Cognitions, emotions and kle\u015bas\n4.3 Cognitions, emotions and kle\u015bas\n\nWhile the argument about the difference between perception and love\ndoes not show that love requires previous experience, it raises, (at\nleast) two interesting questions about the Buddhist account of the\nemotions: i) why does \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita draw a distinction\nbetween perception and feeling on the basis of the non-existence of\nexternal objects in the case of love, hatred and desire? ii) why does\nhe make a specific argument about love and hatred when he has already\nargued in previous verses of the\nLok\u0101yata-par\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 that all cognitions\nrequire other cognitions as their causes?\n\nIn what follows, these questions are addressed briefly in reverse\norder. The second question raises the general problem of the\ntranslatability of the concept of feeling or emotion into Sanskrit. As\nmentioned in the introduction, there is no general term in Sanskrit\nfor emotion and \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita uses the expression\n\u201clove and hatred etc.\u201d (r\u0101ga-dve\u1e63a +\n\u0101di). In the translation, Jha has taken the\n\u201cetc.\u201d as referring to other feelings, assuming that\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was operating with a psychological\ncategory such as \u201cfeeling\u201d. However, there is no single\nword in the text which would translate as feeling every time it\nappears in the translation. In fact, it is clear that\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita does not mean \u201cfeelings\u201d in\nthe sense of non-representational attitudes towards objects because\nlove and hatred have objects according to him, albeit mental objects.\nSince \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita remains within the context of\nBuddhist psychology and clearly refers to Dharmak\u012brti, it is\nplausible that he means \u201cother kle\u015bas\u201d\ninstead of \u201cother feelings\u201d because love and hatred are\nkle\u015bas and have objects.\n\nIn this context, it is also important to discuss the translation of\nthe term vij\u00f1\u0101na as \u201ccognition\u201d. Both\nterms refer to a mental phenomenon that provides knowledge. This means\nthat they refer to a state of affairs that pertains in the world. Both\nterms presuppose an external or mental object they are directed\ntowards. One important difference between these two terms, which shows\nthe difficulty with translating vij\u00f1\u0101na as\ncognition, is that, according to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, a\nvij\u00f1\u0101na always has an object but it does not have\nto have conceptual content. In this sense, even a sensation or\nfeeling, such as the sensation of pleasure, is a\nvij\u00f1\u0101na because it has an object but lacks\nconceptual content, according to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita. The\nsensation has an object because it provides knowledge about mental\nstates and therefore has to have an object of knowledge. However, this\nobject is not conceptual. So, according to\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, a vij\u00f1\u0101na includes\naffective mental states, such as feelings, sensations and emotions and\ntherefore kle\u015bas. The Western term\n\u201ccognition\u201d, by contrast, excludes affective mental\nstates.\n\nThe whole of the Lok\u0101yata-par\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 of the\nTattva-sa\u1e43graha is one argument for the existence of an\ninfinite chain of vij\u00f1\u0101nas that is independent of\nits physical manifestation. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita,\n\u201clove, hatred and the rest\u201d are examples of\nvij\u00f1\u0101nas. These vij\u00f1\u0101nas are\nalso kle\u015bas but not all vij\u00f1\u0101nas\nare kle\u015bas. Love and hatred are especially useful for\nhis argument because they are fundamental to our experience and\nemphasize the continuity of the \u201cchain of\nvij\u00f1\u0101nas\u201d.\n\nAccording to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita,\nvij\u00f1\u0101nas can include feelings and emotions\nwhereas in Western psychology and philosophy cognitions are distinct\nfrom emotions and feelings. This means that the role of\nvij\u00f1\u0101nas in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\nsystem is different from the role of cognitions in Western psychology\nand philosophy. As I mentioned above, in the history of Western\nphilosophy the distinction between feeling and cognition has often\nbeen used as the demarcation between feeling and rational thought with\nthe ideal of affectless thought. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nother Buddhist philosophers the ideal is not necessarily that of\naffectless thought. Instead, their ideal is that of an existence free\nfrom afflictions (kle\u015bas). So, they try to extinguish\none kind of mental phenomenon but their distinction is different from\nthe distinction between feeling and thought. For them, all mental\nphenomena that provide an obstacle to liberation should be eliminated.\nThis includes what Western psychologists would call emotions or\nfeelings. However, it also includes many affectless cognitions. This\nmeans that the Western psychological category \u201cemotions\u201d\ndoes not feature prominently in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\naccount of the mind. In fact, it is not clear that he would even\nrecognize such a category. According to Buddhist psychology, some\nkle\u015bas straddle the Western divide between feeling and\nthought. They involve both feeling and thought and they are a mental\nphenomenon, called a vij\u00f1\u0101na. Whereas for many\nphilosophers in the history of Western philosophy, the ideal has been\nto purge feeling from thought, in order to attain a standard of\nrationality, the ideal for \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and other\nBuddhist philosophers is to free our mental life from those\nvij\u00f1\u0101nas which are kle\u015bas. The\nreason is not to attain some standard of rationality because, for\nBuddhists, most vij\u00f1\u0101nas are suspect in that they\ninvolve an attachment to the present life and therefore pose an\nobstacle to liberation.\n\nOne question that arises in this context is \u201cwhy does\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita single out love and hatred, instead of\ndiscussing kle\u015bas in general?\u201d. One answer might\nbe that they are fundamental to our human experience and therefore\nlend themselves to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s argument that\ncognitions in general do not come into existence with the body.\n\nIn Western discussions of this topic, feelings are very often\nassociated with some physical change, such as a quicker heartbeat or a\nchange in the chemical make up of the brain. For this reason, emotions\nare very often regarded as providing some link between the mental and\nthe physical. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita mentions this link between\nfeeling and physical changes in TS 1960. He claims that phlegm\n(bal\u0101sa) and other bodily changes are not responsible\nfor love, hatred or perturbations through sexual arousal because there\nis no observed concomitance between them. While this claim might be\ntrue with regard to phlegm, it is obviously false with regard to other\nphysical changes, especially changes in the brain. However, it would\nbe wrong to completely dismiss \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\nargument simply because he turned out to be wrong about this empirical\nclaim. After all, the argument raises important questions about the\nstatus of mental phenomena, such as love and hatred. This becomes\nclear when we think about the other question mentioned earlier: why\ndoes \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita distinguish between perceptions on\nthe one hand and love and hatred on the other hand based on the\nexistence or non-existence of external objects? While\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita often adopts an idealist position\ncompatible with the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra standpoint in the\nTattva-sa\u1e43graha, he seems to switch to a realist\nposition in this case which is compatible with a\nSaut\u0101ntrika standpoint. The best explanation for this\nswitch is that \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla\nare arguing against Lok\u0101yata philosophers (materialists), who do\nnot share the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra outlook on reality. This means that\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla try to find\ncommon ground with these philosophers and therefore share their\nassumptions about the mind-independent existence of an external world.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s and Kamala\u015b\u012bla\u2019s\nargument then is that even with this assumption in place, it does not\nfollow that all cognitions are dependent on or even identical with the\nbody. According to them, the Lok\u0101yata philosophers would have to\ndraw a distinction between perceptions on the one hand and love and\nhatred on the other hand, and while they might be able to account for\nperceptions they are not able to account for love and hatred.\n",
