Traces of Positivism in Religion and Metaethics\n\n\nHare did not suppose that the modern thinking man could long remain\nwhat he called a \u201csimple believer\u201d; so he welcomed\nattempts by R.B. Braithwaite and others to empty religion of dogmatic\ncontent.  He called himself a \u201cChristian empiricist\u201d, but\nthought the question whether he was really a Christian\nterminological.  What he retained for himself was what he once called\na \u201cblik\u201d, an attitude to the world which somehow gave him\nconfidence to live and think morally, trusting (as he put it)\n\u201cin my own continued well-being (in some sense of that world\nthat I may not now fully understand) if I continue to do what is right\naccording to my lights\u201d, as also \u201cin the general\nlikelihood of people like Hitler coming to a bad end\u201d (1950/1:\n38). John Hare (2002: 307) connects the inhibitions that held his\nfather back from belief not just with modern skepticism, but with\n\u201ca philosophical doctrine about meaning which he inherited from\nCarnap and the logical positivists\u201d; for \u201cHe thought he\ncould not make meaningful assertions about subjects, like God, which\nlay beyond the limits of possible sense experience\u201d. Thus he\ndenied that the transcendental has anything to do with prayer, asking\n\u201cWhat is the difference between there being a transcendental God\nwho listens to the prayer and directs events accordingly, and it just\nbeing the case that the events take place?\u201d, and answering\n\u201cNone at all\u201d (1973: 27). The upshot is fatal to the\northodoxies of belief as of unbelief:\nWhere the transcendental is concerned, there is no\ndifference between a true story and a myth; it is therefore wrong to\nspeak of the person who prays having an illusion that there\nis somebody that he is praying to. (ibid.)\nSimple belief, it turns out, lacks even a content.\n\nAlso traceable to positivism was a recurrent tendency to doubt the\nsubstantiality of philosophical disagreement. Presumably Plato was\nmaking a mistake of a kind when, as Hare diagnosed it, he\ninterpreted the experience which we call\n\u201chaving a particular mental image of a square\u201d as\n\u201chaving, on a particular occasion, a mental look at the\nSquare\u201d. (1964: 67)\nWithin meta-ethics, however, Hare was inclined to suppose that such\nvariations fail to be more than verbal. This suspicion was first\nexpressed in an unpublished paper \u201cMoral Objectivity\u201d\n(1949\u201350). Here Hare imagines a White (an objectivist) who calls\n\u201ca moral intuition\u201d what a Black (a subjectivist) calls\n\u201ca feeling of approval\u201d, and wonders about the point at\nissue:\nNow we may well ask, seeing that we are all agreed\nthat there is this experience, no matter what you call it,\nwhat on earth is the point of having long philosophical arguments\nabout what you do call it.\nTake a case of disagreement about pacifism:\nThe Whites describe this situation by saying that\nthere is a difference of opinion between us as to whether fighting\ndoes or does not possess the quality right; the Blacks, on the other\nhand, describe it by saying that we have different feelings about\nfighting. But the situation which they are both trying to describe is\nprecisely the same, and they know it \u2026 They are disagreeing\nmerely about words.\nHare pursued this skepticism in two published\npapers, \u201cNothing Matters\u201d (1959), and \u201cOntology in\nEthics\u201d (1985). Here he suspects of vacuity certain terms that\nget overworked, \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfact\u201d,\n\u201cworld\u201d, \u201cobjective\u201d, \u201crealist\u201d,\n\u201ccognitivist\u201d; hence he thinks it much harder than many\nhave done to define a position that is distinctively objectivist. (It\nis certainly not enough to reassert \u201cMurder is wrong\u201d in a\npeculiar and, as it were, metaethical tone of voice, firm and yet\nunemotive.) What I have traced back to a verificationism that may now\nseem dated becomes well-grounded when applied to abstractions that, as\nappropriated by philosophers, await a clear sense.\n",
