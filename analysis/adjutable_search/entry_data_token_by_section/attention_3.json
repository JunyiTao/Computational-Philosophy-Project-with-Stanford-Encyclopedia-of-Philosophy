    "main_text": "Historical Overview || William James and His Contemporaries: Deflationary Theories\n1.5 William James and His Contemporaries: Deflationary Theories\n\nThe diversity of explanatory roles assigned to attention in the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries meant that theorizing about\nattention at the end of the nineteenth century was in a chaotic state.\nThe ambition for theorists of attention writing at the end of the\nnineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries was to get\nthis chaos into order. The theories of attention proposed in this\nperiod therefore tended to take the form of attempts to reveal\nattention as something less mysterious and less complex than earlier\nwriters had supposed. This ambition to give a \u2018nothing\nbut\u2026\u2019 reduction of attention can be seen in the most\ninfluential work from this period: William James\u2019 The\nPrinciples of Psychology (1890).\n\nOne aspect of James\u2019 approach is to play down the more complex\nperceptual aspects of attention. His chapter on attention includes a\ndiscussion of experiments into what we now call\n\u2018subitizing\u2019\u2014that is, into the ability to perceive\nthe cardinality of small stimulus sets without needing to count their\nmembers\u2014but James writes of these experiments that it \u201cis\nobvious that such observations decide nothing at all about our\nattention, properly so called\u201d (407).\n\nAlthough James plays down attention\u2019s role in complex perceptual\nphenomena, he does assign attention to an important explanatory role\nin the production of behaviour. He claims, for example, that\n\u2018Volition is nothing but attention\u2019 (424). But when James\nmakes such claims it is as part of a general project that seeks always\nto be deflationary where possible. When James associates attention\nwith volition it is as a way of suggesting how volition could be given\na deflationary treatment, not as a way of inflating attention\u2019s\nexplanatory role.\n\nThis deflationary approach to attention\u2019s explanatory remit\nmeans that, when it comes to giving an account of the \u2018intimate\nnature of the attention process\u2019, James can identify two fairly\nsimple processes which, he claims, \u2018probably coexist in all our\nconcrete attentive acts\u2019. and which \u2018possibly form in\ncombination a complete reply\u2019 to the question of\nattention\u2019s \u2018intimate nature\u2019 (1890, 411). The\nprocesses that James identifies are:\n\nThe accommodation or adjustment of the sensory organs, and\nThe anticipatory preparation from within of the ideational centres\nconcerned with the object to which attention is paid. (411)\n\n\nThe first of these processes is reasonably familiar. By \u2018the\naccommodation or adjustment of the sensory organs\u2019 James means\nsuch processes as pointing one\u2019s ears in the right direction,\nbringing one\u2019s eyes into focus, taking a sniff, and so on.\n\nJames\u2019s talk of \u2018anticipatory preparation\u2019 of\n\u2018ideation centres\u2019 is a little less clear, but the point\nis again a quite straightforward one. What James has in mind here is\nsimply imagination. His claim is that when attention does not\ninvolve adjusting one\u2019s sense organs it consists in imagining\nthe things or actions that one is attending to, or looking for.\n\nJames illustrates his claim about attention\u2019s link to\nimagination with an example from Hermann von Helmholtz. This example\nis an important one for James, and it illustrates some important\nfeatures of attention that subsequent theorists have tended to\nneglect. The example involves the variety of attention that needs to\nbe paid when trying to discern the overtones in a note played on the\npiano. Helmholtz asks us to sit at the piano and to play a G, then,\nimagining the sound that we have just heard, to play a low C. Doing\nthis, it is claimed, enables one to hear that G is discernibly there\n(as the third overtone) within the sound produced when C is played.\nHelmholtz\u2019s claim, which James endorses, is that the kind of\nattention that is paid when listening for an overtone is constituted\nby the imagining of what that overtone would sound like. James goes\nonto claim that there is a wide range of cases in which paying\nattention to what one is doing consists in this same sort of\npreparatory imaginative engagement.\n\nHere, as in his more frequently discussed treatment of emotion, it is\ndistinctive of James\u2019s approach that he tries to account for a\nlarge-scale personal-level psychological phenomenon in a realist but\nsomewhat revisionary way, so as to be able to give his account using\nrelatively simple and unmysterious explanatory resources. An\nalternative deflationary approach\u2014one which James explicitly\ncontrasted with his own\u2014is the approach taken in 1886 by F.H.\nBradley.\n\nBradley advocated a view according to which attention is not the sort\nof phenomenon for which an independent and substantive theory can or\nneeds to be given. Bradley does not develop this point in much detail,\nand it is a point on which he would later change his mind, but in his\n1886 article, \u2018Is there a special activity of attention?\u2019,\nBradley was concerned with arguing that a project such as\nJames\u2019s one of identifying particular processes as the\nattention-constituting ones was wrongheaded. He claims that no\nparticular attention-processes can be identified since:\n\nAny function whatever of the body or the mind will be active attention\nif it is prompted by an interest and brings about the result of our\nengrossment with its product. There is no primary act of attention,\nthere is no specific act of attention, there is no one kind of act of\nattention at all. (1886, 316)\n\n\nAlthough Bradley does not use the Lockean vocabulary (and although\nJames himself does not seem to have taken Bradley in this way),\nBradley\u2019s position here has much in common with Locke\u2019s\nclaim that attention is a mode. Bradley\u2019s position,\nlike Locke\u2019s, is that what is essential to an instance of\nattention is not the matter of which processes are taking\nplace, but the facts about how the things that happen happen.\nHe therefore takes the ennumeration of processes to be the wrong form\nfor a theory of attention to take.\n\nOther writers who were contemporary with Bradley and James took\ndifferent approaches to the project of giving a deflationary\nexplanation of attention. In Th\u00e9odule Ribot\u2019s 1888 book\nLa Psychologie De L\u2019Attention the attempt to explain\nattention took an approach that we would now classify as behaviourist.\nIn 1888 behaviourism had not yet been established as a general\napproach in philosophical or psychological theories of the mind, but\nRibot\u2019s suggestion that attention\u2019s behavioural\nmanifestations are essential to it is nonetheless recognizable as an\nearly articulation of behaviourism in a strong form:\n\nAre the movements of the face, the body, and the limbs and the\nrespiratory modifications that accompany attention, simple effects,\noutward marks, as is usually supposed? Or are they, on the contrary,\nthe necessary conditions, the constituent elements, the\nindispensable factors of attention? Without hesitation we accept\nthe second thesis. (1888, 19)\n\n\nA somewhat more moderate version of this behaviour-centred approach\nwas taken by Alexander Bain, who identified attention, not with its\nbehavioural manifestations themselves, but with truncated versions of\nthe motor-control processes that typically bring about those\nbehavioural manifestations: processes \u2018stopping short of the\nactual movement performed by the organ\u2019 (Bain, 1888, 371). Much\nas Ribot\u2019s view can be seen as an early version of behaviourism,\nBain\u2019s view can be seen as an early version of the motor-based\napproaches to attention that can be found in the literature of the\npresent century (see\n Section 2.8\n below).\n",
