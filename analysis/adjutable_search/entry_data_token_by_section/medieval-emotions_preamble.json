    "main_text": "\n\nOne of the many uses of the Greek word pathos in ancient\nphilosophy referred, roughly speaking, to what we call emotions. The\ncorresponding Latin terms were passio, affectus or\naffectio. Medieval theories of emotions were essentially\nbased on ancient sources. The new developments included the discussion\nof emotions from the point of view of Avicennian faculty psychology,\nthe production of systematic taxonomies particularly in\nthirteenth-century Aristotelianism, the detailed studies of voluntary\nand involuntary aspects of emotional reactions, as well as late\nmedieval re-evaluations of the sharp divide between the emotions and\nthe will.\n",
