    "main_text": "Alternative Conceptions of Justification || Postulates and Hinges\n5.1 Postulates and Hinges\n\nOne approach has been to turn to general reflection on what is even\nneeded for justification of an inference in the first place. For\nexample, Wittgenstein raised doubts over whether it is even meaningful\nto ask for the grounds for inductive inferences.\n\n\nIf anyone said that information about the past could not convince him\nthat something would happen in the future, I should not understand\nhim. One might ask him: what do you expect to be told, then? What sort\nof information do you call a ground for such a belief? \u2026 If\nthese are not grounds, then what are grounds?\u2014If you say these\nare not grounds, then you must surely be able to state what must be\nthe case for us to have the right to say that there are grounds for\nour assumption\u2026. (Wittgenstein 1953: 481)\n\n\nOne might not, for instance, think that there even needs to be a chain\nof reasoning in which each step or presupposition is supported by an\nargument. Wittgenstein took it that there are some principles so\nfundamental that they do not require support from any further\nargument. They are the \u201chinges\u201d on which enquiry\nturns.\n\nOut of Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas has developed a general notion of\n\u201centitlement\u201d, which is a kind of rational warrant to hold\ncertain propositions which does not come with the same requirements as\n\u201cjustification\u201d. Entitlement provides epistemic rights to\nhold a proposition, without responsibilities to base the belief in it\non an argument. Crispin Wright (2004) has argued that there are\ncertain principles, including the Uniformity Principle, that we are\nentitled in this sense to hold.\n\nSome philosophers have set themselves the task of determining a set or\nsets of postulates which form a plausible basis for inductive\ninferences. Bertrand Russell, for example, argued that five postulates\nlay at the root of inductive reasoning (Russell 1948). Arthur Burks,\non the other hand, proposed that the set of postulates is not unique,\nbut there may be multiple sets of postulates corresponding to\ndifferent inductive methods (Burks 1953, 1955).\n\nThe main objection to all these views is that they do not really solve\nthe problem of induction in a way that adequately secures the pillars\non which inductive inference stands. As Salmon puts it,\n\u201cadmission of unjustified and unjustifiable postulates to deal\nwith the problem is tantamount to making scientific method a matter of\nfaith\u201d (Salmon 1966: 48).\n",
