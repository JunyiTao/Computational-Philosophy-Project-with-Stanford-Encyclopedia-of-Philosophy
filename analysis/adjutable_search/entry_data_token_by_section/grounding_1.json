    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Determination and explanation\n1.1 Determination and explanation\n\nAn important initial choice point in theorizing about grounding\nconcerns the theses of unionism and separatism\n(Raven 2015: 326). Proponents of unionism work with an\nexplanation-based conception of grounding, stipulating that grounding\nis a form of explanation, what we will call\nexplanationG (Dasgupta 2017; Fine 2012a;\nLitland 2015; Rosen 2010). For unionists, to say that the bowl\u2019s\nbrittleness is grounded in the ionic bonds of its constituent atoms\nis, in the first instance, to say that the bowl is brittle because\nthese bonds are ionic, that it\u2019s brittle in virtue of the ionic\nbonding, or that the brittleness is accounted for by the bonding.\n\nSeparatists, on the other hand, work with a determination-based\nconception of grounding. The guiding idea here is an analogy between\ncausation and grounding. Causation, while itself a form of\ndetermination rather than explanation, nevertheless backs\nexplanations. So too separatists claim with grounding: grounding,\nrather than being a form of explanation, is a form of\ndetermination\u2014what we will call\ndeterminationG\u2014that backs\nexplanations (Audi 2012a; Schaffer 2009, 2012, 2016a; Trogdon 2013a).\nFor separatists, to say that the bowl\u2019s brittleness is grounded\nin the ionic bonds of its constituent atoms is, in the first instance,\nto say that these bonds non-causally generate, produce, or bring about\nthe bowl\u2019s brittleness. Just what the intuitive notion of\nbacking ultimately comes to in the context of causation and grounding\nisn\u2019t an entirely settled matter\u2014some understand backing\nin terms of representation (Trogdon 2018a), while others suggest that\nbacking itself is to be given a grounding-theoretic treatment (Kovacs\n2020; Wirling 2020). (The\n\u201cexplanationG\u201d and\n\u201cdeterminationG\u201d terminology is\nborrowed from Skiles and Trogdon (2021)).\n\nUnionists, as we understand them, are committed to there being\ninstances of a certain form of explanation and to providing an account\nof what it\u2019s like; they don\u2019t have a corresponding\ncommitment regarding any form of determination. For separatists, the\nreverse is the case. Hence, unionism and separatism are importantly\ndifferent theses (cf. Dasgupta 2017: fn. 8; Kovacs 2020). And note\nthat, even if we agree that there is both\nexplanationG and\ndeterminationG, there still may be substantive\nreasons to go with one view rather than the other. For example, if,\nsay, explanationG is conceptually prior to\ndeterminationG, then perhaps we should, all other\nthings being equal, interpret grounding claims as targeting in the\nfirst instance the former rather than the latter. Compare: Strevens\n(2008: Ch. 6) claims that we ought to interpret causal claims (e.g.,\n\u201cThe stone striking the glass caused the window to\nshatter\u201d) as targeting in the first instance causal explanation\nrather than causation understood as a form of determination, as the\nformer is conceptually prior to the latter.\n",
