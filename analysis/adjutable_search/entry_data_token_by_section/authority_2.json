This implies a very distinct dimension of political\nauthority. When a political authority issues a command and the subject\nhas a duty to obey, what is the nature of this duty? One might have a\nduty to obey a command merely because it commands the subject to do\nsomething that is just and any alternative action would be unjust. Here\nthe duty to obey would depend on the content of the command. Commands\nthat are unjust or perhaps even commands that require actions that are\nnot exclusively just may not involve duties at all.\n\n\nThe commands of a legitimate political authority are usually thought\nto involve something more than this. The duty of the subject is\ngrounded not in the content of the command itself but in the nature of\nthe source issuing the command. The duty to obey is then automatically\ngenerated when the command is issued by the appropriate authority and\nwhen it has the right form and provenance. In this respect, the duty to\nobey is content independent or independent of the content of the\nparticular command. One must obey because one has been commanded and\nnot because of the particular content of the command. One must do it\nbecause one has been told to do it. This kind of duty seems to be the\nmost central kind of duty involved in the duty to obey. It is the idea\nthat one must obey the authority because it is the authority. It does\nnot imply of itself that one owes the duty of obedience to the\nauthority so it does not imply that there is a right to rule on the\npart of the authority.\n\n\nHere we must distinguish a duty that is owed to the authority and a\nduty that is merely the result of the authoritative command. The duty\nthat is owed to the authority is grounded in the fact that the\nauthority possesses a feature that gives it a right to command and that\nit is in virtue of that right that one owes obedience. The idea is that\nthere is something just in itself that the authority be obeyed.\n\n\nOne other distinction that is worth making in this connection is the\ndistinction between a preemptive duty to obey and a duty that is not\npreemptive. A preemptive duty is one that replaces other duties. It\nputs other duties out of play when it comes into play. A preemptive\nduty is not weighed against other duties that might relate to what one\nis thinking of doing. Of course, a preemptive duty may not preempt all\nother considerations, its preemption may operate only with a limited\nscope and thus preempt only some limited set of considerations.\n\n\nAn example of a preemptive duty is the case of a promissory\nobligation. If I have agreed to do something for you and I suddenly see\nsome pleasurable alternative to fulfilling my obligation, most people\nwould think that I ought to exclude the consideration of pleasure\naltogether from my deliberations even though the pleasure would be a\nconsideration had I made no promise. It is simply not something that I\ncan legitimately weigh in the balance against the promissory\nobligation. So if an authority issues a command and the duty to obey is\na preemptive duty, then the subject does not weigh the other duties\nthat might otherwise apply to him in the balance with the preemptive\nduty. The preemptive duty simply excludes the other duties. By\ncontrast, if a duty is not preemptive, then when it comes time to\ncomply with it, one must balance it with other duties that weigh for\nand against acting in accord with the duty.\n\n\nMost think that the duties associated with authority are content\nindependent in the sense that one must do what one is told even if one\nis skeptical about the merits of the command. There is some\nskepticism, however, about the claim that legitimate political\nauthorities impose preemptive duties on subjects. These people have\nquestioned the rationality of preemptive duties or reasons for\naction. Surely, there are times when what appear to be preempted\nconsiderations all add up to a consideration that outweighs the\npreempting consideration. How can this be understood on the preemption\nmodel? Some have argued that authoritative commands simply give\nespecially weighty content independent duties, which can be balanced\nagainst other duties (Shapiro 2002). The discussion of instrumentalism\nwill say a bit more about these criticisms below.\n\n\nThe most demanding notion of authority is the idea of a political\nauthority that has a right to rule that correlates with a duty to obey\nthat is owed to the authority and that is a content independent and\npreemptive duty.\n",
