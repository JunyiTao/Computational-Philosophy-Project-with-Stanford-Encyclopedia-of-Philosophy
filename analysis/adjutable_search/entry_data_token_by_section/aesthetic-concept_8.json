    "main_text": "The Concept of the Aesthetic || Aesthetic Value\n2.5 Aesthetic Value\n\nTo count as complete a theory of aesthetic value must answer\ntwo questions:\n\nWhat makes aesthetic value\naesthetic?\nWhat makes aesthetic value\nvalue?\n\n\nThe literature refers to the first question sometimes as the\naesthetic question (Lopes 2018, 41\u201343; Shelley 2019, 1) and\nsometimes as the demarcation question (van der Berg 2020, 2;\nMatherne 2020, 315; Peacocke 2021, 165). It refers to the second as\nthe normative question (Lopes 2018, 41\u201343; Shelley\n2019, 1; Matherne 2020, 315).\n2.5.1 The Aesthetic Question\n\nThe prevailing answer to the aesthetic question is aesthetic\nformalism, the view that aesthetic value is aesthetic because\nobjects bear it in virtue of their perceptual properties, where these\nencompass visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, and tactile\nproperties. Aesthetic formalism rose to prominence when and because\nartistic formalism did, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries\n(see Section 5.1). Because everyone then took artistic value to be a\nspecies of aesthetic value, artistic formalism could gain prominence\nonly by dragging aesthetic formalism in its train. But whereas\nartistic formalism has since fallen from favor, aesthetic formalism\nhas held its ground. The explanation, arguably, has to do with the way\naesthetic formalism honors the conceptual link between the aesthetic\nand the perceptual. Any adequate answer to the aesthetic question must\nmeet what we may call the perceptual constraint, that is, it\nmust plausibly articulate the sense in which aesthetic value is\nperceptual. Aesthetic formalism does this in the clearest possible\nterms.\n\nVersions of aesthetic formalism come in varying strengths. Its\nstrongest versions hold objects to have aesthetic value strictly in\nvirtue of their perceptual properties (Bell 1958/1914; Danto 2003,\n92). Weaker versions either allow objects to have aesthetic value in\nvirtue of their non-perceptual content so long as that content\nexpresses itself perpetually (Zangwill 1998, 71\u201372) or require merely\nthat objects paradigmatically have aesthetic value in virtue of their\nperceptual properties (Levinson 1996, 6). All versions of aesthetic\nformalism struggle, one way or another, to accommodate our\nlong-standing practice of ascribing aesthetic value to objects that do\nnot address themselves primarily to the five bodily senses. Consider\nworks of literature. We have been ascribing aesthetic value to them\nfor as long as we have been ascribing aesthetic value to artworks of\nany kind. How might the aesthetic theorist square her theory with this\npractice? A first approach is simply to dismiss that practice,\nregarding its participants as linguistically confused, as applying\nterms of aesthetic praise to objects constitutionally incapable of\nmeriting it (Danto 2003, 92). But given how extremely revisionist this\napproach is, we ought to wait on an argument of proportionately\nextreme strength before adopting it. A second approach allows that\nliterary works bear aesthetic value, but only in virtue of their\nsensory properties, such as properties associated with assonance,\nconsonance, rhythm, and imagery (Urmson 1957, 85\u201386, 88;\nZangwill 2001, 135\u2013140). But this approach accounts for a mere\nfraction of the aesthetic value we routinely ascribe to works of\nliterature. Suppose you praise a short story for the eloquence of its\nprose and the beauty of its plot-structure. It seems arbitrary to\ncount only the eloquence as a genuine instance of aesthetic value. A\nthird approach treats literary works as exceptional, allowing them,\nalone among works of art, to bear aesthetic value in virtue of their\nnon-perceptual properties (Binkley 1970, 269;\nLevinson 1996, 6 n.9). The difficulty here\nis to explain literature\u2019s exceptionality. If literary works\nsomehow bear aesthetic value in virtue of non-perceptual properties,\nwhat prevents non-literary works from doing the same? Moreover, to\nwhatever degree we allow things to have aesthetic value in virtue of\ntheir non-perceptual properties, to that degree we sever the\nconnection the formalist asserts between the aesthetic and the\nperceptual and so undermine our reason for adopting aesthetic\nformalism in the first place.\n\nWe might be forced to choose from among these three formalist\napproaches to literature if aesthetic formalism constituted the only\nplausible articulation of the sense in which aesthetic value is\nperceptual, but it doesn\u2019t. Instead of holding that aesthetic\nvalue is perceptual because things have it in virtue of their\nperpetual properties, one might hold that aesthetic value is\nperceptual because we perceive things as having it. This would be a\ncorollary of the immediacy thesis as defined in Section 1.1. If, as\nthat thesis holds, aesthetic judgment is perceptual, having all the\nimmediacy of any standard perceptual judgment, then aesthetic\nproperties are perceptual, grasped with all the immediacy of standard\nperceptual properties. That aesthetic properties are thus perceptual\nis Sibley\u2019s point in the following:\n\nIt is of importance to note first that, broadly speaking, aesthetics\ndeals with a kind of perception. People have to see the grace\nor unity of a work, hear the plaintiveness or frenzy in the\nmusic, notice the gaudiness of a colour scheme, feel\nthe power of a novel, its mood, or its uncertainty of tone. (Sibley\n2001, 34, emphasis in original)\n\n\nSibley says that people have to see the grace or unity of a work and\nthey have to feel the power of a novel. He doesn\u2019t say that they\nhave to see the properties in virtue of which a work has grace or\nunity or feel the properties in virtue of which a novel has power: the\nproperties in virtue of which a work has grace or unity need not be\nperceptual and the properties in virtue of which a novel has power\npresumably will not be. Thus the literature problem, over which\nformalism stumbles, does not arise for Sibley, nor for anyone else\ncommitted to the immediacy thesis, including\nShaftesbury (Cooper 1711, 17, 231), Hutcheson (1725,\n16\u201324), Hume (1751, Section I), and Reid (1785, 760\u2013761),\namong others. For the immediacy theorist, the aesthetic value we\nascribe to literary works is aesthetic because we perceive literary\nworks as bearing it.\n2.5.2 The Normative Question\n\nThe prevailing answer to the normative question is aesthetic\nhedonism, the view that aesthetic value is value because things\nhaving it give pleasure when experienced. Aesthetic hedonism achieved\nprominence in the 19th century, roughly when aesthetic formalism did.\nSchopenhauer played a pivotal role in bringing it to prominence by\nreassigning disinterested pleasure from the role it had been playing\nin aesthetic judgment to the role of grounding aesthetic value\n(Schopenhauer 1818 [1969], 195\u2013200). Bentham (1789, ch. 4) and\nMill (1863 [2001]; ch. 2) arguably played larger roles by popularizing\nvalue hedonism, that is, the view that pleasure is the ground of all\nvalue. But whereas value hedonism no longer holds much sway in ethics,\nand Schopenhauer no longer exerts much influence in aesthetics,\naesthetic hedonism has held its ground. The explanation presumably has\nto do with the apparent ease with which aesthetic hedonism explains\nwhy we seek out objects of aesthetic value. Any adequate answer to the\nnormative question must meet what we may call the normative\nconstraint, that is, it must plausibly identify what a\nthing\u2019s having aesthetic value gives us reason to do. Aesthetic\nhedonism, locating that reason in the pleasure taken in experiencing\naesthetically valuable objects, does this in the clearest possible\nterms.\n\nAdvocates of aesthetic hedonism include Schopenhauer 1818 [1969], Clive\nBell 1914 [1958], C. I. Lewis 1946, Monroe Beardsley 1982, George Dickie\n1988, Alan Goldman 1990, Kendall Walton 1993, Malcolm Budd 1995,\nJerrold Levinson 1996, 2002, Gary Iseminger 2004, Robert Stecker 2006,\n2019, Nick Stang 2010 and Mohan Matthen 2017. It is only quite\nrecently that any sustained opposition to hedonism has arisen, a fact\nthat may go some way toward explaining why hedonists, as a rule, see\nno need to argue for their view, opting instead to develop it in light\nof objections an imagined opposition might make.\n\nBeardsley, for instance, leads with this simple formulation of\nhedonism:\n\nThe aesthetic value of an object is the value it possesses in virtue\nof its capacity to provide aesthetic gratification. (Beardsley 1982,\n21).\n\n\nBut he then anticipates a fatal objection. Sometimes we undervalue\naesthetic objects, finding them to have less value than they actually\nhave; other times we overvalue aesthetic objects, finding them to have\ngreater value than they actually have. The simple formulation above is\nconsistent with undervaluation, since it is possible to take less\naesthetic pleasure from an object than it has the capacity to provide,\nbut inconsistent with overvaluation, since it is impossible to take\ngreater aesthetic pleasure from an object than it has the capacity to\nprovide (Beardsley 1982, 26\u201327). To remedy this problem,\nBeardsley appends a rider:\n\nThe aesthetic value of [an object] is the value [it] possesses in\nvirtue of its capacity to provide aesthetic gratification when\ncorrectly and completely experienced (Beardsley 1982, 27, italics\nin original).\n\n\nSuppose we refer to the italicized portion of this formulation as\nthe epistemic qualification and the non-italicized portion as\nthe hedonic thesis. The epistemic qualification renders the\nhedonic thesis consistent with overvaluation, given that you can\nmisapprehend an object such that you take greater aesthetic pleasure\nfrom it than it has the capacity to provide when apprehended correctly\nand completely.\n\nBeardsley\u2019s version of aesthetic hedonism has served as a model\nfor subsequent versions (Levinson 2002, n. 23); at least all\nsubsequent versions consist of an epistemically qualified hedonic\nthesis in some form. Beardsley\u2019s version, however, seems open to\ncounter-example. Consider Tony Morrison\u2019s Beloved, for\ninstance, or Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian. Taking\npleasure from works designed to cause shock, horror, despair, or moral\nrevulsion may seem perverse; surely, it may seem, such works do not\nhave whatever aesthetic value they have in virtue of any pleasure they\ngive. One way to accommodate such cases is to cast aesthetic pleasure\nas a higher-order response, that is, a response that depends on\nlower-order responses, which in some cases might include shock,\nhorror, despair, and moral revulsion (Walton 1993, 508; Levinson 1992,\n18). Another way is to broaden the field of experiences that may\nground aesthetic value. Though pleasure as a rule grounds aesthetic\nvalue, in exceptional cases certain non-hedonic yet intrinsically\nvaluable experiences\u2014which may include horror, shock, despair,\nand revulsion\u2014may also do so (Levinson 1992, 12; Stecker 2005,\n12). The literature refers to this latter, broadened variety of\nhedonism as aesthetic empiricism; it hasn\u2019t settled on\na name for the former variety, but we may call it tiered\nhedonism, given the varying levels of response it takes aesthetic\nexperience to comprise.\n\nYet another objection, anticipated by hedonists, holds hedonism to\nimply the heresy of the separable experience (Budd 1985,\n125). It is a commonplace that for any object bearing aesthetic value\nnothing other than it can have just the particular value it has,\nexcepting the improbable case in which something other than it has\njust its particular aesthetic character. The worry is that hedonism,\ngiven that it regards aesthetic value as instrumental to the value of\nexperience, implies that for any object bearing aesthetic value\nsomething wholly other from it, such as a drug, might induce the same\nexperience and so serve up the same value. The hedonist\u2019s usual\nreply is to assert that aesthetic experience is inseparable from its\nobject, such that for any aesthetic experience, that experience is\njust the particular experience it is because it has just the\nparticular aesthetic object it has (Levinson 1996, 22\u201323; Budd\n1985, 123\u2013124; S. Davies 1994: 315\u201316; Stang 2012,\n271\u2013272).\n\nActual opposition to hedonism did not materialize until the present\ncentury (Sharpe 2000, Davies 2004), and most all of that during the\npast decade or so (Shelley 2010, 2011, 2019; Wolf 2011; Lopes 2015,\n2018; Gorodeisky 2021a, 2021b). Why the opposition took so long to\nshow up is a good question. It is tempting to think its answer resides\nin the obvious truth of the hedonist\u2019s central premise, namely,\nthat aesthetically valuable objects please us, at least in general.\nAnti-hedonists, however, have taken no interest in denying this\npremise. One useful way to think of the dialectic between hedonists\nand their opponents is to regard each as grasping one horn of an\naesthetic version of the Euthyphro dilemma, where hedonists hold\nthings to have aesthetic value because they please and anti-hedonists\nhold things to please because they have aesthetic value (Augustine\n2005/389\u2013391, De vera religione \u00a759; Gorodeisky\n2012a, 201 and 2021b, 262). Seen this way, the fact that aesthetically\nvaluable things please tells not at all in favor of the hedonist;\nindeed, it is precisely this fact that the anti-hedonist thinks the\nhedonist cannot explain.\n\nFor instance, Wolf, in the context of an extended, nuanced case\nagainst value welfarism, argues that aesthetic hedonism cannot account\nfor the fact that Middlemarch is a better novel than the\nDa Vinci Code,given that most people apparently like the latter\nbetter, presumably because it gives them greater pleasure (Wolf 2011,\n54\u201355; see also Sharpe 2000, 326). The hedonist has a ready\nreply in the claim that all standard versions of hedonism are now\nepistemically qualified, that while most people may derive greater\npleasure from the Da Vinci Code, a fully informed\nreader\u2014that is, a reader who gives both texts a correct and\ncomplete reading\u2014will not, assuming Middlemarch to be\nthe better novel. But it\u2019s not clear how much appeal to the\nepistemic qualification ultimately helps the hedonist. The\nanti-hedonist will want to know what best explains the fact that a\nfully informed reader will derive greater pleasure from\nMiddlemarch (Wolf 2011, 55; D. Davies 2004, 258\u2013259;\nSharpe 2000, 325). Suppose we say that it owes to the fully informed\nreader\u2019s grasping the superiority of\nMiddlemarch\u2019s structure, the higher quality of its\nprose, the greater subtlety and depth of its character development,\nand the greater penetration of the insights it affords (Wolf 2011,\n55). Wouldn\u2019t we then be saying that it owes to her grasping the\ngreater aesthetic value of Middlemarch? Wouldn\u2019t that\nbe part of what a fully informed reader is fully informed about?\n\nOf course, the hedonist may allow Middlemarch to be\naesthetically better because of its superior structure, prose,\ncharacter development, and insight; to allow this, from her point of\nview, is simply to allow that these are the elements in virtue of\nwhich a fully informed reader will derive greater pleasure. But here\nit would be good if the hedonist had an argument. Otherwise, the\nanti-hedonist will rightly wonder how it is that a correct and\ncomplete experience of Middlemarch will be an experience of\nevery value-conferring feature of Middlemarch yet not an\nexperience of the value conferred by those features. She will rightly\nwonder whether the hedonist fails to honor her own commitment to\nexternalism about aesthetic value; she will rightly wonder, in other\nwords, whether the hedonist fails to distinguish between a valuable\nexperience and an experience of value, just as the internalist about\naesthetic value fails to distinguish between a coherent and complete\nexperience and an experience of coherence and completeness.\n\nEarlier we attributed the appeal of hedonism to the apparent ease with\nwhich it explains our seeking out objects of aesthetic value.\nAnti-hedonists take that ease to be apparent merely. Some\nanti-hedonists, for instance, argue that at least some aesthetically\nvaluable objects offer up pleasure only on condition that we do not\nseek it (Lopes 2018, 84\u201386; Ven der Berg 2020, 5\u20136; see\nalso Elster 1983, 77\u201385). Lopes puts the point this way:\n\nSometimes an agent has an aesthetic reason to act and yet they could\nnot be motivated to act out of a hedonic desire that would be\nsatisfied by their so acting. To get any pleasure, they must act out\nof non-hedonic motives. Strolling through the Louvre, they happen upon\nthe Chardins, and they look at them. So long as they do not look\nseeking pleasure, they get the pleasure that the paintings afford\n(Lopes 2018, 85\u201386).\n\n\nLopes\u2019s choice of example is not arbitrary. There are particular\nart-critical reasons for thinking that Chardins will frustrate the\nhedonically motivated viewer (Fried 1980, 92; cited in Lopes 2018,\n85), and Lopes is careful to claim that only \u201csome aesthetic\npleasures are essential by-products of acts motivated by other\nconsiderations\u201d (Lopes 2018, 85). But it\u2019s not as if\nLopes\u2019s claim is specific to Chardins. Consider again\nWolf\u2019s assertation that most readers take greater pleasure from\nThe Da Vinci Code than from Middlemarch. If that\nassertion is correct, as it plausibly is, perhaps this is because (a)\nmost readers read for pleasure, and (b) The Da Vinci Code\naffords pleasure to readers who read for it, whereas (c)\nMiddlemarch withholds pleasure from such readers, affording\npleasure instead on readers who read in pursuit of some non-hedonic\ngood.\n\nThere is an apparent tension, moreover, between the hedonist\u2019s\nreliance on the epistemic qualification and her claim that pleasure\nrationalizes our aesthetic pursuits. Consider the\nless-than-fully-informed reader who overvalues The Da Vinci\nCode and undervalues Middlemarch. The epistemic\nqualification is designed to allow the hedonist to explain how this\nmight occur: such a reader takes greater pleasure from The Da\nVinci Code, and less (or lesser) pleasure from\nMiddlemarch, than she would were she fully informed. The\nepistemic qualification, moreover, allows the hedonist to explain why\nthe uninformed reader has aesthetic reason not to undervalue\nMiddlemarch: she is missing out on pleasure that would be\nhers if only she gave Middlemarch a fully informed reading.\nBut the hedonist struggles to explain why the uninformed reader has\nreason not to overvalue the Da Vinci Code. If The Da\nVinci Code gives the reader greater pleasure when she overvalues\nit, not only has she no aesthetic reason to be fully informed, she has\naesthetic reason not to be. It therefore seems that if pleasure\nrationalized our hedonic pursuits, we would take ourselves to have\nreason to experience aesthetic objects in whatever way maximizes our\npleasure. To the degree that we instead take ourselves to have reason\nto experience aesthetic objects completely and correctly\u2014to the\ndegree that we instead take ourselves to have reason to experience\naesthetic objects as having the aesthetic values they in fact\nhave\u2014suggests that pleasure is not the aesthetic good\nwe\u2019re after (Shelley 2011).\n\nBut if pleasure is not the aesthetic good we\u2019re after, what is?\nPart of hedonism\u2019s perceived inevitability over the past century\nor so has owed to our inability even to imagine alternatives to it. If\nopposition to hedonism has been slow to materialize, alternatives have\nbeen slower still. To date, the only fully realized alternative to\nhedonism is Lopes\u2019s network theory of aesthetic normativity,\narticulated and defended in his ground-breaking Being for Beauty:\nAesthetic Agency and Value (2018).\n\nEarlier we noted how Lopes challenges the hedonist on her own terms,\nobjecting that she cannot adequately explain why we seek out objects\nof aesthetic value, given that aesthetic pleasure is at least\nsometimes an essential by-product of our seeking after something else\n(2018, 84\u201386). Lopes\u2019s deeper challenge, however, targets\nthe hedonist\u2019s very terms. Aesthetic considerations rationalize\na very great variety of aesthetic acts, according to Lopes:\nappreciating objects of aesthetic value is one such act, but so too is\nhanging a poster one way rather than another, selecting this book\nrather than that one for a book club, building out a garden this way\nrather than that, conserving one video game rather than another,\npairing this dish with this wine rather than that one, and so on\nad infinitum (2018, 32\u201336). If a theory of aesthetic\nvalue is to accommodate such a vast range of aesthetic acts, without\nsingling out any one as more central than the others, it will have to\nconceive of aesthetic normativity as a species of some very general\nkind of normativity. Lopes, accordingly, conceives of aesthetic\nnormativity as a species of the most generic form of practical\nnormativity; that aesthetic acts ought to be performed well follows\nfrom the premise that all acts ought to be performed well for the\nsimple reason that they are acts (2018, 135\u2013137). As Lopes puts\nit: \u201cAesthetic values inherit their practical normativity from a\nbasic condition of all agency\u2014agents must use what they have to\nperform successfully\u201d (2018, 135). Just which competencies an\naesthetic agent may call upon to perform successfully on any given\noccasion depends on the particular role they happen to be playing in\nthe particular social practice in which they happen to be performing\n(2018, 135). It is from the fact that all aesthetic activity\nnecessarily takes place within the domain of some particular social\npractice that the network theory of aesthetic value takes its name\n(2018, 119).\n\nIn holding aesthetic agents to be performing the greatest variety of\naesthetic acts on the greatest variety of items in coordination with\none another, the network theory departs radically from hedonism. But,\nas Lopes himself observes, the network theory follows after hedonism\nin one fundamental way: inasmuch as both theories \u201canswer the\nnormative question but offer nothing in answer to the aesthetic\nquestion,\u201d both \u201care consistent with any stand-alone\nanswer to the aesthetic question\u201d (2018, 48). The claim that the\nnormative and aesthetic questions admit of stand-alone answers implies\nthat aesthetic value is a species of the genus value\nin a standard species-genus relation, such that what makes aesthetic\nvalue value has no bearing on what makes it aesthetic and vice-versa.\nIt therefore also implies that aesthetic value is not a\ndeterminate of the determinable value, such that what makes\naesthetic value aesthetic is very thing that makes it value.\n\nDo answers to the normative and aesthetic questions stand alone or\nstand together? If we have not yet registered the urgency of this\nquestion, perhaps that is because no one has yet fully articulated,\nlet alone defended, a theory of aesthetic value according to which\naesthetic value is a determinate form of value. Such a theory appears\nto be implicit, however, in Shelley 2011, Watkins and Shelley 2012,\nGorodeisky and Marcus 2018, Gorodeisky 2021a, and Shelley 2022. The\nposition common to these authors has been dubbed the Auburn\nview (Van der Berg 2020, 11). It answers the aesthetic question,\nand therein the value question, by holding an item\u2019s having\naesthetic value to rationalize its appreciation in a distinctively\nself-reflexive way, such that part of what you perceive when you\nappreciate an aesthetically valuable item is that it ought to be\nappreciated as you appreciating it (Shelley 2011, 220\u2013222;\nWatkins and Shelley 2012, 348\u2013350; Gorodeisky and Marcus 2018,\n117\u2013119; Gorodeisky 2021a, 200, 207; Shelley 2022, 12). The\nnetwork theorist may object that the Auburn view privileges acts of\nappreciation as surely as hedonism does, but such an objection, from\nthe Auburn perspective, begs the question. It is in assuming that the\nnormative and aesthetic questions admit of stand-alone answers that\nthe network theorist grants herself the freedom of passing on the\naesthetic question, and it is in passing on the aesthetic question\nthat she grants herself the freedom of treating each of a very great\nvariety of aesthetic acts as equally central. It is in assuming that\naesthetic value is a determinate of the determinable\nvalue, meanwhile, that the Auburnite places herself under the\nnecessity of answering the aesthetic question, and it is in seeking an\nanswer to the aesthetic question that she places herself under the\nnecessity of singling out appreciation as aesthetically central. The\nnetwork theorist and the Auburnite agree that the aesthetic question\ndeserves an answer sooner or later (Lopes 2018, 46). They disagree,\ncrucially, about whether it deserves an answer sooner rather than\nlater.\n\nThe network theory and the Auburn view hardly exhaust the options for\nnon-hedonic theories of aesthetic normativity: Nguyen 2019, Matherne\n2020, Peacocke 2021, Kubala 2021, and Riggle 2022 all represent\npromising new directions. Yet every new theory of aesthetic value,\nhedonic or not, must follow after the network theory or the Auburn\nview in regarding answers to the normative and aesthetic questions as\nstand-alone or stand-together. A lot hangs on the decision to follow\none path rather than the other. Perhaps it\u2019s time we attend to\nit.",
