    "main_text": "Physics: The Critical Period (Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science) || Phenomenology\n2.5 Phenomenology\n\nThe final chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nPhenomenology, focuses on how the motion of matter can be experienced\nmodally. Specifically, Kant spells out conditions for us to judge\nlegitimately that a body possibly moves; is really in motion; or that\nits motion is necessary. Its three Propositions specify (in\naccordance, Kant suggests, with the results of the three previous\nchapters) that (i) rectilinear motion is a merely possible predicate\nof matter, (ii) circular motion is an actual predicate of matter, and\n(iii) the equal and opposite motion of one matter with respect to\nanother is a necessary motion of that matter. In the General Remark to\nthe Phenomenology, Kant discusses the status of absolute space, which\nhad been presupposed by the possible, actual, and necessary motions of\nmatter at issue in the three main propositions, and explains that\nsince it is not itself an object of experience, it must be represented\nby means of an idea of reason (in Kant\u2019s technical sense of\n\u201cidea,\u201d namely, as a concept for which a corresponding\nobject could never be given to us in intuition). Though we can never\nknow absolute space, it nonetheless functions as a regulative\nprinciple that guides us in our scientific practice by forcing us to\nlook for further conditions for the conditioned objects we meet with\nin experience. Kant\u2019s view that ideas of reason can function as\nregulative principles is developed in the Appendix to the\nTranscendental Dialectic in the Critique of Pure Reason.\n\nFriedman\u2019s interpretation of the Phenomenology deserves special\nmention. According to him, in light of Kant\u2019s rejection of\nNewton\u2019s absolute space and time, he must give an account of the\nconcept of true motion \u2013 as change of true place over time\n\u2013 presupposed by classical mechanics. To this end, Kant\n\u201cviews the laws of motion as definitive or constitutive of the\nspatio-temporal framework of Newtonian theory,\u201d hence these laws\n\u201ccount as a priori\u201d for him (1992, 143). The reason Kant\ntakes them as constitutive is the following. In Kant\u2019s\nPhenomenology, the three Newtonian laws define a concept of\ntrue motion: the true motions of bodies just are those that\nobey the dynamical laws. Moreover, the concept must be given\n\u201cobjective meaning in experience,\u201d viz. measured\nempirically. To do so, Kant views Newton\u2019s three laws as holding\nprimarily in a privileged system of reference, namely the\ncenter-of-mass (CM) frame of the system of the world, which the\nCM-frame of our Solar System approximates to a very good degree. Thus,\nby measuring the motions of bodies relative to this frame, we produce\nobjective experience of these motions. However, this frame must first\nbe located. To do so, Kant thinks, we must likewise count the\nlaw of universal gravitation as a priori, not empirical-inductive. If\nwe know a priori that all bodies in the Solar System necessarily\nattract each other, from their observable, mutually-induced\naccelerations we can infer their masses. In turn, knowing their masses\nwill enable us to locate the CM-frame of the system. (In a system of\nbodies, the center of mass is the point relative to which the\nbodies\u2019 distances are in inverse proportion to their masses.)\nWith respect to this distinguished frame, the motions of bodies count\nas their true motions, Friedman claims. However, the CM-frame of the\nSolar System is just approximately an inertial frame. Scientific\ninquiry must ultimately look beyond it, to better and better\napproximations of an inertial frame. And, Kant\u2019s absolute space\nis just the concept that directs our search for such approximations.\nMore recently, Friedman updated and expanded his interpretation in\n(2013). In view of recent scholarship, Friedman has now made a\nconvincing case that it is Kant\u2019s laws of mechanics\n\u2013 not Newton\u2019s three laws, as claimed in (1992) \u2013\nthat define the privileged frame (Kantian absolute space) relative to\nwhich bodies have true motions, in the Phenomenology.\n\nPrior to Friedman\u2019s interpretation, there is relatively little\nsecondary literature that discusses Kant\u2019s Phenomenology.\nCarrier (1992) gave an alternative to Friedman\u2019s account of Kant\non absolute space. Two chapters (by De Bianchi and Massimi,\nrespectively) in McNulty 2022 add to our understanding of this aspect\nin Kant\u2019s thought. Stan (forthcoming) assesses the Phenomenology\nin its early-modern context.\n",
