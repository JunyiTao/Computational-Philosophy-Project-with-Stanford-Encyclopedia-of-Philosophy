Three Views of Supererogation: Problems of Justification\n\nThe modern debate whether there actually are supererogatory acts has\nlost its traditional fervor typical of the great religious disputes\nbetween Catholics and Reformers in the 16th and\n17th centuries. One reason is that there are no direct\npolitical or institutional stakes involved in the contemporary\ndiscussions, such as Church power in granting indulgences (although\nthere is a supererogatory dimension in the contemporary idea of Truth\nand Reconciliation Commissions). Yet, the issue between\nsupererogationists, as they are often called, and their opponents\nstill runs deep and involves the general relationship between the\n\u201cgood\u201d and the \u201cought\u201d.\n\nThe views about the possibility and value of supererogatory acts can\nbe grouped under three categories:\n\nAnti-supererogationism: since all morally good action is\nobligatory, there cannot be a separate class of morally good action\nthe omission of which is not wrong.\nQualified supererogationism: there are actions which lie beyond\nthe call of duty, but their value is derived from their being\nhypothetical duties, subjective duties, duties from which one may be\nexcused, that is, duties in a weaker sense.\nUnqualified supererogationism: supererogatory actions lie entirely\nand without qualification beyond the requirements of morality and that\nis the source of their unique value.\n\n\nLike any classification, this one is somewhat artificial and\narbitrary. Some particular views of supererogation cannot be easily\nand neatly subsumed under one of its categories. The distinction\nbetween (1) and (2) hinges on the nature of the relevant\n\u201cqualification\u201d: even the rigorous deniers of\nsupererogation are willing to accept some form of excuse for not\nengaging in particularly difficult or demanding moral action, and\nqualified supererogationists may often admit that a heroic action is\nobligatory even if it is unrealistic for society to expect individuals\nto perform it. The borderline between (2) and (3) is also often vague,\nsince when one tries to explain what makes a class of actions\nsupererogatory, in the unqualified sense of being fully optional, one\nis often drawn back to the difficulty or risk in performing it, to the\nparticular personal virtue required to do so, or in general terms to\ncertain qualifying conditions which justify leaving them beyond the\ndemands of morality.\n\nThe three views of supererogation are three responses to the\n\u201cparadox of supererogation,\u201d namely how can the moral good\nnot be required as a duty. The first view recognizes the paradox and\naddresses it by denying the very possibility of supererogation; the\nsecond resolves what it sees as an apparent paradox by explaining the\nconditions under which duty loses its prescriptive force; the third\nview denies that there is in the first place any paradox in the gap\nbetween the \u201cgood\u201d and the \u201cought,\u201d thus\nleaving room for an independent category of supererogation.\n",
