    "main_text": "\n\nThe notion of collective responsibility, like that of\npersonal responsibility and shared responsibility,\nrefers in most contexts to both the causal responsibility of\nmoral agents for harm in the world and the blameworthiness that we\nascribe to them for having caused such harm. Hence, it is, like its\ntwo more purely individualistic counterparts, almost always a notion\nof moral, rather than purely causal, responsibility.\nBut, unlike its two more purely individualistic counterparts, it does\nnot associate either causal responsibility or blameworthiness with\ndiscrete individuals or locate the source of moral responsibility in\nthe free will of individual moral agents. Instead, it associates both\ncausal responsibility and blameworthiness with groups and\nlocates the source of moral responsibility in the collective actions\ntaken by these groups understood as collectives.\n\nSince this notion of collective responsibility makes groups, as\ndistinct from their individual members, out to be moral agents, it has\nundergone a great deal of scrutiny in recent years by methodological\nand normative individualists alike. Methodological individualists\nchallenge the very possibility of associating moral agency with\ngroups, as distinct from their individual members, and normative\nindividualists argue that collective responsibility violates\nprinciples of both individual responsibility and fairness. In response\nto these challenges, proponents of collective responsibility set out\nto show that collective responsibility, as well as group intentions,\ncollective action, and group blameworthiness, are metaphysically\npossible and can be ascribed to agents fairly in at least some, if not\nall, cases.\n\nWhile the vast majority of those now writing on collective\nresponsibility in philosophical circles continue to debate the\npossibility of collective responsibility, a growing number of scholars\nhave in recent years placed three further\u2014and very\nimportant\u2014concerns at the center of our attention. The first has\nto do with whether groups have to meet the same stringent conditions\nof moral responsibility that individuals do. (Intentionality becomes a\nprimary site of controversy here.) The second has to do with the\nadvantages and disadvantages of holding particular kinds of groups,\ne.g., nation states, races, and ethnic groups, morally responsible in\npractice. The third has to do with what moral implications follow for\ngroup members from the moral responsibility of their group for harm.\n(Do they, too, become morally responsible for the harms and, if so,\nhow is the blame to be distributed?)\n\nThe backward looking notion of collective responsibility cited above\nis what most philosophers have in mind when they talk about collective\nresponsibility. But during the past several years there has been a\ngrowing interest in what has come to be known as forward looking\ncollective responsibility or forward looking collective moral\nresponsibility. Forward looking collective responsibility, unlike\nits backward looking counterpart, does not focus on whether a\nparticular collective agent caused harm in the sense relevant to moral\nblameworthiness. Nor does it involve itself with blame in general.\nInstead, it focuses on what, if anything, the agent can be expected to\ndo with respect to remedying the harm and preventing its reoccurrence.\nHence, it is sometimes referred to as remedial responsibility\nand incorporated into larger controversies about the scope of our\nduties to respond.\n",
