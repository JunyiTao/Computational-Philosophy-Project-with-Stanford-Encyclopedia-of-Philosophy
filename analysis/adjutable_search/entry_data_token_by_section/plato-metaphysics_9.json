    "main_text": "The Meno\n10. The Meno\n\n\nThe Meno is probably a transitional work, bridging the\nSocratic and the middle period dialogues. While the first third of the\nMeno is concerned with ethical questions, what is virtue and\nis virtue teachable, the last two-thirds address themselves to\nepistemological details generated from the thesis that virtue is\nknowledge. Here we find for the first time mention of recollection,\nwhich Socrates proposes as a solution to a paradox of inquiry put\nforward by Meno. The paradox is this (80d-e):\nFor anything, F, either one knows F or\none does not know F. \n\n\n\nIf one knows F, then one cannot inquire about\nF.\n\n\nIf one does not know F, then one cannot inquire about\nF.\n\n\nTherefore, for all F, one cannot inquire about\nF.\n\n\n\nPlato resolves the paradox by showing that there are different ways\nin which one might be said to \u2018know\u2019 something and that\nsometimes having a belief about F is adequate to begin an\ninquiry into F. In his famous question and answer with a slave\nabout how to find the diagonal of a given square, Socrates argues that\nlatent within the slave is an understanding of how to determine the\ndiagonal (81\u201386b). The slave has various beliefs, some false and some\ntrue, about the way to discover the length of the diagonal. What is\nneeded is only a set of prompts, here a set of questions, to elicit\nfrom the boy the knowledge that is latent within him. Socrates contends\nthat he is leading the slave to recollect what he already knows. In the\nsubsequent stages of the argument, Socrates distinguishes the sense in\nwhich a person can be said to merely have a belief about something\n(into which one might inquire), from the sense in which he can be said\nto know the same thing (97ff). For instance, suppose that Jones has\nlooked at a map and determined how to drive from New York City to\nChicago though he has not done so: just get on Interstate 80 and go\nwest. On the other hand, suppose that Smith has actually driven\nnumerous times from NYC to Chicago by getting on 80 and heading west.\nBoth Jones and Smith have the same belief about how to get from NYC to\nChicago and both will get there by acting on their belief. But only\nSmith has knowledge of the road, whereas Jones has a true belief. The\ntruth of the belief is then not at issue. Rather, Smith has something\nmore, some kind of justification, here based on experience, that\ndistinguishes her from Jones: Jones has only a true belief about how to\nget there; Smith actually knows. Thus in the Meno, we have\nperhaps the first attempt to offer a justified true belief account of\nknowledge: Knowledge is a true belief tied down with an account\n(aitias logismos, 98a). The Meno, then, with its\ndiscussion of recollection, knowledge and belief sets the stage for the\nmiddle Platonic epistemology.\n",
