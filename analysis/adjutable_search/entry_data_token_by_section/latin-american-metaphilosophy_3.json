    "main_text": "What Is Latin American Philosophy?\n2. What Is Latin American Philosophy?\n\nAs noted above, in contemporary Latin American philosophy lively\nmetaphilosophical debates, recognized as such by its participants, are\na frequent occurrence. The Peruvian Augusto Salazar Bondy\n(1925\u20131974) held that such debates belong to \u201cthe\nphilosophy of philosophy\u201d (1968, p. 13). He also divided the\nissues at stake into three categories, descriptive, prescriptive, or\nidentity issues (1968, p. 11), a classification that is for the most\npart still current. One exception is that, today, questions about\nwhether a philosophy is \u201coriginal, genuine, or peculiar\u201d\nare not strictly descriptive. For these predicates seem both\ndescriptive and evaluative, and therefore analogous to others now\nconsidered thick moral predicates, such as\n\u2018cruel,\u2019 \u2018loyal,\u2019 and the like.\n",
