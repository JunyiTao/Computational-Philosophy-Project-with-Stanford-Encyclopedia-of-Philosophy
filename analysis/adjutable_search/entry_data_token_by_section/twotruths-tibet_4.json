    "main_text": "Gelug\n5. Implications\n\nGelug considers the two natures of each phenomenon as the defining\nfactor of the two truths. It argues that the conventional nature of an\nentity, as verified by a conventionally reliable cognitive process,\ndetermines the defining criterion of conventional truth; the ultimate\nnature of the same entity, as verified by an ultimately reliable\ncognitive practice, determines the defining criterion of ultimate\ntruth. Since both truths are ontologically as well as\nepistemologically interdependent, knowledge of conventionally real\nentitity as dependently arisen suffices for knowledge of both truths.\nIn contasty non-Gelug schools\u2014Nyingma, Kagy\u00fc and Sakya\nNon-Gelug, as we have seen, rejects Gelug\u2019s dual-nature theory,\ntreating each conventional entity as satisfying only the definition of\nconventional truth and taking the definition of ultimate truth to be\nontologically and epistemologically transcendent from conventional\ntruth. They argue, instead, it is through the perspectives of either\nan ordinary being or an unenlightened exalted being\n(\u0101ryas) that the definition of conventional truth is\nverified\u2014fully enlightened being (buddhas) do not\nexperience the conventional truth in any respect. Similarly, for\nnon-Gelug, no ordinary being can experience the ultimate truth.\nUltimate truth transcends conventional truth, and the knowledge of\nempirically given phenomena as dependently arisen could not satisfy\nthe criterion of knowing ultimate truth.\n\nFor Gelug, there is an essential compatibility between between the two\ntruths, for the reason that there is a necessary harmony between\ndependently arisen and emptiness of intrinsic reality. As dependently\narisen, empty phenomena are not constructions of ignorant\nconsciousness, so neither is conventional truth such a construction.\nBoth truths are actual truths that stand on an equal footing.\nMoreover, according to this view, whosoever knows conventional truth,\neither directly or inferentially, also knows ultimate truth; whosoever\nknows ultimate truth, also knows phenomena as dependently arisen, and\nhence knows them as empty of intrinsic reality. Where there is no\nknowledge of conventional truth, the converse applies. For non-Gelug,\nthe incommensurability between dependently arisen and emptiness of\nintrinsic reality also applies to the two truths. Accordingly,\nwhosoever knows conventional truth does not know ultimate truth, and\none who knows ultimate truth does not know conventional truth;\nwhosoever knows phenomena as dependently arisen does not know them as\nempty, whereas whosoever knows phenomena as empty does not know them\nas dependently arisen.\n\nWhile Gelug thus distances itself from the subjective division of the\ntwo truths, Nyingma, Kagy\u00fc and Sakya attempt to demonstrate the\nvalidity of their view by arguing that perspective provides the\nprimary basis for the division of the two truths. Unlike Gelug,\nnon-Gelug schools hold that the two truths do not have any objective\nbasis. Instead they are entirely reducible to the experiences of the\ndeluded minds of ordinary beings and the experiences of the wisdom of\nexalted being.\n\nAccording to Gelug, the agent who cognizes the two truths may be one\nand the same individual. Each agent may have all the requisite\ncognitive resources that are potentially capable of knowing both\ntruths. Ordinary beings have only conceptual access to ultimate truth,\nwhile exalted beings, who are in the process of learning, have direct,\nbut intermittent, access. Awakenened beings, however, invariably have\nsimultaneous access to both truths. The view held by non-Gelug argues\nfor separate cognitive agents corresponding to each of the two truths.\nOrdinary beings have direct knowledge of conventional truth, but are\nutterly incapable of knowing ultimate truth. The exalted beings in\ntraining directly know ultimate while they are meditative equipoise\nand conventional truth in post meditative states. Fully awakened\nbuddhas, on the other hand, only have access to ultimate truth.\nAwakened beings have no access to conventional truth whatsoever from\nthe enlightened perspective, although they may access conventional\ntruth from unenlightened ordinary perspectives.\n",
