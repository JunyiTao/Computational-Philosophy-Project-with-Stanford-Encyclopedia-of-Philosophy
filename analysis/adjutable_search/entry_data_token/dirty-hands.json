This question poses what has become known amongst\nphilosophers as the problem of dirty hands. There are many different\nstrands to the philosophical debate about this topic, and they echo\nmany of the complexities in more popular thinking about politics and\nmorality. All, however, involve the idea that correct political action\nmust sometimes conflict with profound moral norms. This entry seeks to\nunravel these strands and clarify the central normative issues about\npolitics that the cry of \u2018dirty hands\u2019 evokes. Beginning\nwith an illustrative passage from a renowned 19th century\nEnglish novel, the essay traces the dirty hands tradition back to\nMachiavelli, though its present vogue is owed mostly to the writings\nof the distinguished American political theorist, Michael Walzer.\nWalzer\u2019s views are explored in the light of earlier theorists\nsuch as Machiavelli and Max Weber and certain vacillations in his\nintellectual posture are briefly discussed. This leads to the posing\nof five issues with which the entry is principally concerned. First,\nis the dirty hands problem simply confused and its formulation the\nmerest contradiction? Second, does the overriding of moral constraints\ntake place within morality or somehow beyond it? Third, can the cry of\ndirty hands be restricted wholly or principally to politics or does it\nspeak equally to other areas of life, and, where politics is\nconcerned, do only the principal agents get dirty hands or do their\ncitizens share in the taint? This is the problem of scope. Fourth, how\nare the circumstances that call for dirty hands best described? Fifth,\nthe dirty hands problem has affinities with the problem raised by\nmoral dilemmas, but the question is: should those similarities be\nallowed to obscure significant differences?\n\nIn the course of addressing these issues, the dirty hands challenge is\nalso distinguished from that of political realism, with which it has\nsome affinities, and the resort to role morality to render dirty hands\ncoherent is discussed, as is the issue of the desirability of shaming\nor punishing dirty hands agents. The relevance of \u201cthreshold\ndeontology\u201d is explored, and it is suggested that much of the\npoint of invoking dirty hands comes from an ambiguous attitude to\nabsolute moral prohibitions, combining a rejection of them with a\ncertain wistful attachment to their flavour.\n", "toc": [{"#Int": "1.

Introduction\n\nAnthony Trollope\u2019s novel, The Way We Live Now, is a\nbiting critique of the corruption of late Victorian morals. One of its\ncentral characters, the shallow Lady Carbury, at one point voices her\nconviction that the praiseworthy deeds of the powerful escape the\nnormal categories of morality. Commenting on the character of the\nnovel\u2019s dominant figure, the grand swindler Melmotte, she says\nto her journalist friend Mr. Booker:\n\n\n\u201cIf a thing can be made great and beneficent, a boon to\nhumanity, simply by creating a belief in it, does not a man become a\nbenefactor to his race by creating that belief?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the expense of veracity?\u201d suggested Mr. Booker.\n\n\u201cAt the expense of anything?\u201d rejoined Lady Carbury with\nenergy. \u201cOne cannot measure such men by the ordinary\nrule.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would do evil to produce good?\u201d asked Mr. Booker.\n\n\u201cI do not call it doing evil\u2026.You tell me this man may\nperhaps ruin hundreds, but then again he may create a new world in\nwhich millions will be rich and happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are an excellent casuist, Lady Carbury.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am an enthusiastic lover of beneficent audacity,\u201d said\nLady Carbury\u2026\n\n\nContemporary moral and political philosophy suffers from no lack of\nenthusiastic admirers of \u201cbeneficent audacity\u201d. At one end\nof a spectrum are those consequentialists who are so captivated by the\nprospect of the new world of \u201chappy millions\u201d that they\nthink it obscurantist to object to any evil means needed to achieve\nit\u2014indeed, they agree with Lady Carbury in not calling such\nmeans evil. At the other end of that spectrum, stand the rather more\nreluctant advocates of \u201cdirty hands\u201d who think that some\nvery good ends, such as the aversion of catastrophe, require the doing\nof evil, but unlike Lady Carbury, they insist on calling it evil,\nthough necessary evil. And like Lady Carbury, they rather think that\nthe agents who so dirty their hands cannot be measured \u201cby the\nordinary rule.\u201d Even so, like W.H. Auden in his poem\n\u201cSpain\u201d, they think such agents doing what current\ncircumstances make \u201cnecessary\u201d should accept the guilt\nthat their immoral actions earn. As Auden puts it:\n\n\n\u201cTo-day the deliberate increase in the chances of death,\n\nThe conscious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder.\u201d\n\n\nThe dirty hands tradition dates back to Machiavelli, though its\npresent currency is largely owed to the American political theorist\nMichael Walzer who gave it the title of dirty hands in an influential\narticle \u201cPolitical Action: the Problem of Dirty Hands\u201d, in\nwhich he coined the term \u201cdirty hands\u201d adapting it from\nJean Paul Sartre\u2019s play of the same name (Walzer 1973). Later,\nWalzer used the idea, though not the term, in his book Just and\nUnjust Wars (1977) in which he argued that an appeal to\n\u201csupreme emergency\u201d could not only explain but justify the\nAllied terror bombing of German cities in the early stages of World\nWar II (Walzer 1977a, 267\u201368). For these early stages, roughly\n(it seems, for Walzer gives no date) up to the end of 1941, the\ndeliberate massacre of thousands of German non-combatants was required\nby supreme emergency, even though it was gravely immoral. The prospect\nand likelihood of a Nazi victory were so dire for the lives and\ncommunal values of those facing defeat that the price of severe\nimmorality was worth paying. In the subsequent conduct of the war,\nWalzer argued, the city bombings were simply immoral (as were the city\nbombings of Japan, including the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and\nNagasaki) and could not be justified by supreme\n emergency.[1]\n When Walzer later revisited the topic of supreme emergency, he made\nit clear that it was a case of dirty hands, indeed he seems to have\ncome to the view that only something like the circumstances\nof supreme emergency could provide a dirty hands justification. So he\nsays, in the later discussion of supreme emergency, that the doctrine\nof dirty hands is that \u201caccording to which political and\nmilitary leaders may sometimes find themselves in situations where\nthey cannot avoid acting immorally, even when that means deliberately\nkilling the innocent.\u201d And again: \u201c\u2026dirty hands\naren\u2019t permissible (or necessary) when anything less than the\nongoingness of the community is at stake, or when the danger that we\nface is anything less than communal death\u201d (Walzer 2004a,\n46).\n2. Shifting Interpretations\n\nThe first thing to notice about this is that the identification of\nsupreme emergency and dirty hands represents a dramatic shift from\nWalzer\u2019s view in his original article, and this shift reflects a\nsignificant ambiguity in the dirty hands tradition. Walzer\u2019s\naccounts of supreme emergency vary somewhat in the treatments in\nJust and Unjust Wars and in the later article,\n\u201cEmergency Ethics\u201d (and we shall attend to this later) but\nin both accounts the necessity to override deep moral constraints only\narises in conditions approaching catastrophe. In the original 1973\npaper, however, the trigger for dirty hands is nowhere near as\nextreme. One example there, with intriguing contemporary relevance,\nconcerned a political leader\u2019s need to torture a suspected\nterrorist in the hope of preventing the likely killing of hundreds of\ninnocent people. This falls well short of the criterion of supreme\nemergency in Walzer\u2019s later writings where the trigger is the\ndevastation of whole peoples and/or their ways of life. Moreover,\nWalzer\u2019s other example in the original paper was of a good\ndemocratic politician bribing a corrupt ward boss to deliver him votes\nwith the promise of improperly delivered school construction\ncontracts. Here not only is the moral violation much less profound\nthan in the former case, but the emergency could hardly be considered\n\u201csupreme\u201d in any sense even if we allow that the votes are\nneeded to win an important election and that the politician is\ngenuinely motivated to do good when elected. In Walzer\u2019s initial\ntreatment, there is also some ambiguity in the use of the term\n\u201cdirty hands\u201d since he sometimes uses it for any\nconspicuous immorality as well as the more interesting and technical\nsense we are concerned with. So he says \u201cIt is easy to get\none\u2019s hands dirty in politics and it is often right to do\nso\u201d (Walzer 1973, 174). The first clause seems to point to the\nwidespread temptation to resort to immorality where the second\nindicates that it isn\u2019t always right to do so, hence demarcating\na positive normative sense of \u201cdirty\u201d from a merely\ndescriptive sense. The use of \u201coften\u201d shows the more\nconcessive attitude to the scope of dirty hands in contrast to\nWalzer\u2019s later view.\n\nEarlier writers concerned with the need for politicians to dirty their\nhands with immoral behaviour show some of this vacillation, sometimes\nstressing the extreme stakes that are involved, but more often\nappearing to view the political process generally as above morality,\nor at least operating with a different morality. (\u201cOne cannot\nmeasure such men by the ordinary rule\u201d). John M. Parrish in an\ninteresting and far-ranging book (Parrish, 2007) shows that there are\nelements of the concern about the generally challenging nature of\npolitics for morality as early as Plato\u2019s Republic.\nParrish\u2019s understanding, however, of what constitutes dirty\nhands is often so broad as to obscure some of the distinctions,\nambiguities and problems arising from current philosophical\ndiscussions. to be fair, he is interested in charting a sort of\npre-history to the contemporary debate, and admits that \u201cthe\nproblem may have changed over time\u201d so that there is \u201ca\nsuccession of dirty hands problems\u201d (Parrish, p. 18). Even so,\nsome of the apparently morally troubling examples he discusses from\nancient intellectual sources have none of the marks of the\ncontemporary problem. Augustine\u2019s insistence, for example, that\neven a justly waged war is morally regrettable is accompanied by the\nuntroubled argument that the warrior whose cause and intention is just\ndoes not sin at all (i.e., violate any moral obligation) in killing\nhis enemy. Parrish\u2019 emphasis on the idea that political life is\npervasively morally problematic, however, does find echoes in early\nmodern treatments that foreshadow the contemporary dirty hands\ndiscussion. One such influential treatment is that of Machiavelli. So\nMachiavelli thinks that the ordinary processes of politics require\nthat the Prince \u201cmust learn how not to be good\u201d, though he\nshould maintain the appearance of virtue and indeed behave virtuously\nwhen the cost is low (Machiavelli 1513, 52). Max Weber stresses the\nway that regard for consequences must dominate the thinking of the\npolitician as contrasted with ordinary or religiously inspired ethics.\nThis contrast lies behind the opposition Weber discerns in\n\u201cPolitics as Vocation\u201d between \u201can ethic of\nresponsibility\u201d and \u201can ethic of ultimate ends\u201d.\nAlthough the terms in which Weber frames the contrast tend to confuse\nrather than clarify the issues, it is probable that one thing he has\nin mind for the \u201cultimate ends\u201d side of the conflict is an\nethic involving absolute prohibitions; he sees these as being in\ntension with an outlook geared to counting consequences. As Weber puts\nit: \u201cthere is an abysmal contrast between conduct that follows\nthe maxim of an ethic of ultimate ends-that is, in religious terms,\n\u2018the Christian does rightly and leaves the results with the\nLord\u2019-and conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of\nresponsibility, in which case one has to give an account of the\nforeseeable results of one\u2019s action\u201d (Weber 1919, 120).\nThe starkness of this contrast is one source of confusion since, as we\nshall see later, absolutists are not totally indifferent to\nconsequences \u2014 not all their ethic consists of absolute\nprohibitions-and non-absolutists need not be obsessed only with\nconsequences. But Weber is adamant that it is impossible in politics\nto adhere generally to any absolutist ethic of ultimate ends, largely\nbecause of what he sees as the central role of violence in politics.\nIn spite of Walzer citing him approvingly (up to a point) in his\noriginal article, Weber does not seem to hold anything like\nWalzer\u2019s mature view. He does not think that an ethic of\nultimate ends suffices most of the time, but gives way in conditions\nof supreme emergency; rather his view appears to be that the ultimate\nends ethic is quite generally inadequate to politics. In fact,\nWeber\u2019s belief that violence is central to the operation of\npolitics is exaggerated, though understandable in the circumstances in\nwhich he wrote, but if it were true it might give his position more\naffinity with Walzer\u2019s idea of supreme emergency. The difference\nwould remain that, although violence may well be a factor in\nestablishing supreme emergency, Walzer\u2019s mature understanding of\nsupreme emergency requires more than simply incursions of\nviolence.\n\nThis ambiguity about the extent of the need for dirty hands is\nreflected in much of the literature on the topic. Numerous writers\nhave followed early Walzer (and some elements in both\nMachiavelli\u2019s and Weber\u2019s treatment of political morality)\nin regarding politics as a zone in which, to quote Neil Levy,\n\u201cdirty actions are part and parcel of ordinary political\nlife\u201d. Levy adds: \u201cPoliticians must make deals, compromise\nwith interests they abhor, distribute favours and neglect\nrelationships\u201d (Levy 2007, 52\u20133, endnote 26). A number of\nthese things are no doubt regrettable or distasteful in varying\ndegrees, but whether they are immoral depends on what the deals are,\nwhat the favours involve, how deep the compromise runs, and how\ndamaging the neglect is (and to what sort of relationship). Much of\nwhat various writers regard as the need for dirty hands in politics is\ndubiously an issue of immorality at all. In order to maintain power\nand get important work done, a politician may have to appoint a member\nof a party in coalition with his own to an important Ministry ahead of\na trusted colleague in his own party who has better credentials for\nthe job. This is disappointing and painful to him and his colleague\nand clearly less than ideal (even though the appointee is, we may\nsuppose, competent enough) but I do not think the act can be seen as\nimmoral. To call it morally disagreeable is to signal the fact that\ncertain valuable relations and ends are put under strain by it, but it\nis clearly not is the same league as torture, murder, or gross\ndeceit.\n\nBernard Williams does indeed distinguish levels of gravity in the\nsinning required of politicians in his exploration of the scope of\ndirty hands, but he also suggests that the politician\u2019s\nnecessary immoralities are very common and distinctive. He\ndistinguishes between the morally \u201cdisagreeable or\ndistasteful\u201d and the morally criminal, the latter being subsumed\nunder a broad category of what he calls \u201cviolence\u201d\n(Williams 1978, 71). Although Williams allows that some political\nactions that are popularly believed to be morally dubious, may well be\nmorally acceptable when circumstances are properly understood, he\ncasts a pretty wide net for the morally disagreeable. It involves such\nthings as \u201clying, or at least concealment and the making of\nmisleading statements; breaking promises; special pleading; temporary\ncoalition with the distasteful; sacrifice of the interests of worthy\npersons to those of unworthy persons; and (at least if in a\nsufficiently important position) coercion up to blackmail\u201d\n(Williams 1978, 59). Yet it is unlikely that all of these, as so\ngenerally described, are morally wrong in all circumstances. True,\nsome philosophers have held as much for some of these\u2014Augustine,\nAquinas and Kant for lying, and Kant for promising\u2014but surely\nlying is acceptable in extreme circumstances such as the need to\nprotect an innocent person from a murderer, and even coercion\n(depending on the definition) isn\u2019t always morally wrong,\nwitness the coercive detention of people reasonably suspected of\ncontagious disease that they are unaware of. It seems that most, if\nnot all the things Williams mentions are in the category\n\u201cnormally morally wrong but morally permissible in certain\ncircumstances\u201d. Even blackmail might be in this category since\nblackmailing a vicious criminal in order to secure the freedom of his\nvictim might (perhaps depending on the kind of blackmail) be morally\npermissible. Notions like regret or remorse are sometimes invoked to\nshow that what had to be done was nonetheless immoral, but apart from\nthe fact that an act such as the blackmail of a vicious criminal need\nnot even be regrettable, there are many things one can rightly regret\nhaving to do that are not immoral, for example, punishing a child by\nwithdrawing privileges. Remorse strikes a stronger, more moralised\nnote, but for that very reason one should be careful not to confuse it\nwith various feelings of discomfort, regret or sorrow for having to do\ncertain things. Further investigation of the nature and appropriate\nconditions for remorse is interesting and difficult, but beyond the\nscope of this discussion, and its role as a criterion of dirty hands\nseems at best inconclusive.\n\nThe idea that dirty hands (in contrast to sheer bad behaviour and\ncorrupt activity) are commonplace in politics is highly dubious, but\njust how extensive the reach of this phenomenon is in politics is\ndifficult to determine, and would be best considered on a case by\ncase, or perhaps category by category, fashion. Clearly, the most\nobvious, and I think the most interesting category is that described\nby Williams with the term \u201cviolence\u201d (though that has the\ncontentious, and I think unfortunate implication that all violence is\nimmoral). This covers the acts that Walzer\u2019s later argument\nseeks to capture with his term \u201csupreme emergency\u201d. His\nterminology and his later practice make the scope of dirty hands\npretty restricted, perhaps more so than Williams intended, but I will\nfollow his example and focus on really grave injustices like murder,\ntorture, rape or slavery that are said to be warranted in conditions\nof extreme emergency.\n\nFirst, however, it is worth noting that enthusiasm to detect the sway\nof dirty hands can lead to misdescription of some complex, disturbing\nmoral situations. An interesting example of this has been explored by\nJennifer Rubenstein in connection with problems facing International\nNGOs providing aid in emergency situations such as the refugee camps\nin the Congo. INGO agents have found that their provision of food and\nmedicine is often exploited by warring factions within refugee camps\nand elsewhere (see also some of Fiona Terry\u2019s discussion and\nexamples in Terry 2002). This confronts them with often agonising\ndecisions about whether to cease aid and leave the areas of distress\nbecause of the harm this exploitation generates, including\ncontinuation of violent conflict. If they leave they abandon suffering\npeople, but if they stay, then they contribute unintentionally to\ngreat harms that others inflict on innocent people. Such problems are\noften described with the vocabulary of \u201cdirty hands\u201d, but,\nas Rubenstein argues, this description is misplaced since, for one\nthing, the aid agencies do not themselves intentionally do harm to\navoid some great evil or achieve some great good. Rubenstein proposes\na category of \u201cspattered hands\u201d to describe these\nsituations in order to emphasise that the soiling is contributed by\nthe actions of others (Rubenstein 2014, Chapter 4). We cannot examine\nthe adequacy of her new category here, but she seems right that the\nexamples are misdescribed as dirty hands.\n\nIt will be apparent from all this that the dirty hands problem needs\ninitially some conceptual clarification; this should proceed with a\nview to five issues. First, there is the question whether the dirty\nhands scenario makes any sense at all; perhaps it is just a muddle.\nSecond, there is the related question whether the overriding that\ndirty hands involve (or purport to involve) takes place within\nmorality or somehow beyond it. Third, there is the question whether\ndirty hands are necessitated only or primarily by politics. Fourth,\nhow are the circumstances that call for dirty hands best described?\nFifth, there is the issue of the relation of the dirty hands problem\nto that of moral dilemmas and the requirements of some form of moral\nabsolutism.\n3. A Conceptual Confusion?\n\nLet us examine these in turn. The structure of dirty hands is such\nthat it seems to involve a contradiction or paradox. The advocate of\ndirty hands says in effect that it is sometimes right to do what is\nwrong, and this seems tantamount to saying that some act is both wrong\nand not wrong. But the dirty hands theorist is not saying that it is\nwrong in some respects and right in others, nor that what would\nnormally be wrong is here right. Rather, it is the whole act in\ncontext that is both categorically wrong and not wrong. In the dirty\nhands scenario we are asked to believe that doing X is\nmorally wrong and yet it is palpably right to do it. As Walzer has\nmore recently written of his own position, it is both\n\u201cprovocative and paradoxical\u201d (Walzer 2004a, 33). Kai\nNielson has urged the point even more strongly, but something of the\nsort has puzzled many who contemplate the problem. The category of\ndirty hands, as described by Walzer and some others is, according to\nNielson \u201ca conceptual confusion with unfortunate moral\nresidues\u201d (Nielson 2000, 140). Clearly such a dismissal would\ncome naturally to a utilitarian or most consequentialists who would\nsimply declare the dirty hands decision to be one in which a right act\n(that producing the best consequences in terms of preference\nsatisfactions, overall increase in happiness or whatever) has been\ndone though it may have been distressing to do it. Nielson disavows\nutilitarianism and calls himself a \u201cweak consequentialist\u201d\nbut the upshot is much the same. He thinks that dirty hands situations\nconfront an agent with a choice of two evils and the agent should\nalways choose the lesser evil. No doubt, in acting against what in\nother circumstances is a deep moral constraint, the agent will\nexperience distress; she will \u201cfeel guilty\u201d but feeling\nguilty is not to be confused with being guilty (Nielson 2000,\n140).\n\nFrom the opposite direction the problem can also be resolved by the\ndenial that the hands should become dirty. An insistence on the\ninviolability of some moral prescriptions makes the paradox disappear\nas neatly as the Nielson manoeuvre. If we hold to the prohibition on\nintentionally killing the innocent, for example, in the face of crises\nlike that supposed by Walzer to necessitate the bombing of German\ncities in the early phase of World War II, then there are no dirty\nhands to have. Such a position is often called absolutist. Absolutist\npositions have been explicitly held by many philosophers, notably\nAugustine, Aquinas, and Kant, and implicitly perhaps by many more. The\nposition involves complexities that we will examine later.\n\nBoth these responses agree in holding that moral reasons rightly\ndominate all others. Another way of defusing the strong appearance of\ncontradiction is to hold that morality is not the only legitimate\ndeterminant of right action and that some other determinant may\noccasionally properly trump it. This provides one answer to the second\npoint of clarification mentioned earlier. Dirty hands problems do not\narise within morality but rather when morality clashes with\nsome other rational necessity of a profound kind that correctly\noverrules\n it.[2]\n The overruling must inspire regret, possibly remorse, but it is\nnonetheless clear that the overruling is in order, indeed required.\nHere, it is important to acknowledge that the overruling in question\nis not merely a description of what often happens. It is common\nknowledge that the demands of morality are often enough overridden by\nother persuasive demands, such as imperatives of self-interest,\ncareerism, political advantage and friendship. It may even be that\npolitics is an arena in which such overpowering happens more commonly\nthan elsewhere, so that participation in it is fraught with moral\nhazard that requires an exceptional moral character to overcome.\nNonetheless, the importance and challenge of the dirty hands scenario\nis not that hands get dirty from time to time, but that it is right\nthat they do so.\n\nIf we allow that non-moral \u201coughts\u201d can sometimes trump\nmoral ones then the dirty hands position may be restated as holding\nthat, in circumstances of extremity, reasons of\n\u201cnecessity\u201d (or whatever) defeat important moral reasons.\nThis seems to be one plausible construal of Machiavelli when he talks\nof the necessity that rulers must learn how not to be good. Of course,\nhe has the model of Christian morality in mind when he calls for its\noverriding and so may be understood as opposing one form of morality\nto another, but a good deal of his discussion can be treated as\nelevating \u201creasons of state\u201d above morality. This is a\nrejection of the idea that moral reasons dominate all other\nreasons.\n\nIt may be useful here to distinguish between dominance and\ncomprehensiveness. Most moral theorists hold that morality is both\ncomprehensive and dominant, that is, it relevant to all decisions and\nwhere relevant it defeats all other reasons. One could however hold\nthat morality is comprehensive but not dominant, or dominant but not\ncomprehensive, or indeed neither dominant nor comprehensive. Our\npresent inquiry is concerned with the first two options. The ideas of\ndominance and comprehensiveness express somewhat different pictures of\nthe status of morality, though an exalted understanding of morality\noften draws on both. Morality\u2019s dominance would consist in its\ntrumping all other considerations whenever it is relevant to them,\nwhereas morality\u2019s comprehensiveness consists in its being\nuniversally relevant whether it trumps other considerations or not. On\nthe present interpretation, dirty hands theorists accept\nmorality\u2019s comprehensiveness (at least with respect to the\ndomains they are concerned with) but reluctantly reject its dominance\nfor one class of decisions.\n\nWe might usefully contrast this with the position of the school of\nthinkers called \u201cpolitical realists\u201d whose outlook has\nsome affinity with the dirty hands theorists to the point that the two\nare sometimes confused. Realists are often viewed (and often present\nthemselves) as rejecting the comprehensive relevance of morality by\nreference to something special about politics or international\nrelations. So we find E.H. Carr stating as \u201cthe realist\nview\u201d that \u201cno ethical standards are applicable to\nrelations between states\u2026\u201d (Carr 1962, 153). Other\nrealists come close to this, though their views are clouded by\nuncertainties about morality\u2019s provenance (as indeed are\nCarr\u2019s). Arthur Schlesinger Jr., for instance, claims:\n\u201cThe raw material of foreign affairs is, most of the time,\nmorally neutral or ambiguous. In consequence, for the great majority\nof foreign-policy transactions, moral principles cannot be\ndecisive\u201d (Schlesinger 1971, 73).The influential American\nrealist, Hans Morgenthau, is anxious to separate politics from\nmorality by maintaining \u201cthe autonomy of the political\nsphere.\u201d He recognises the autonomy of other spheres such as\neconomics, law and morality, but insists that the political realist\nmust \u201csubordinate these other standards to those of\npolitics\u201d (Morgenthau 2006, 13). Here, he echoes the position of\nthe German conservative thinker Carl Schmitt by whom he was clearly\ninfluenced. Schmitt became embroiled with the Nazi Party in the 1930s\nand enjoyed (if that is the word) some fame for a time as a\ntheoretician for the Nazi cause. These quotations all suggest the idea\nthat politics, or some significant area of it, such as international\nrelations, falls quite outside the provenance of morality, thus\ndenying morality comprehensiveness, though the reference to\nmorality\u2019s failure to be \u201cdecisive\u201d hints at a\ndenial of dominance. There are many obscurities in the stance of\npolitical realism, and this is not the place to unravel them, but in\nspite of the ambiguities in pronouncements of the leading theorists in\nthe school, and in spite of some continuity between their outlook on\npolitics and that of the dirty hands theorists, it is clear that the\nrealist\u2019s attitude to morality usually has quite a different\nflavour to that of the dirty hands\n theorists.[3]\n Part of this is captured by the difference between the denials of\ncomprehensiveness and dominance, and this connects with the fact that\nwhen realists reject moral considerations they do so with no deep\nsense of regret or remorse for having done what is morally wrong.\n\nThe denial of dominance preserves a certain coherence for morality\nsince it is not, as it were, at odds with itself; it is at times and\nin context at odds with something else which, following both\nMachiavelli and Walzer, might be called \u201cnecessity\u201d. But\nwhat is this necessity? Clearly, it is not meant to be some form of\ndeterministic necessity, since it would have been possible for the\nBritish leadership in World War II to have rejected the policy of city\nbombing outright, as their declared policy prior to the war had\nindicated they would do, a policy that their initial bombing practices\nindeed\n respected.[4]\n Yet there is a trace of this deterministic thought in the idea of\nsupreme emergency with its implication of something that overwhelms\nthe normal power of morality. We might recall in this connection\nThomas Hobbes\u2019s argument that moral dictates cannot apply when\nthey would lead to self-destruction. Hobbes\u2019s idea is that the\nrationality of self-preservation, which itself gives rise to morality,\nmakes acting on morality null and void when acting on it would defy\nself-preservation. As Hobbes puts it: \u201cThe laws of nature oblige\nin foro interno; that is to say, they bind to a desire that\nthey should take place: but in foro externo: this is to the\nputting of them in act, not always. For he that should be modest, and\ntractable, and perform all he promises, in such time, and place, where\nno man else should do so, should but make himself a prey to others,\nand procure his own certain ruin, contrary to the ground of all laws\nof nature, which tend to nature\u2019s preservation\u201d\n(Leviathan, Ch. XV, p. 99).\n\nHobbes certainly does paint a totally isolated scenario for the person\nwho would obey the moral law\u2014\u201cwhere no man else should do\nso\u201d\u2014and one might wonder whether the institution of\npromising could even exist in so bleakly uncooperative \u201ctime and\nplace\u201d as he supposes. But presumably a sufficient number of\nnon-cooperators would serve to make one \u201ca prey to others\u201d\nand procure \u201ccertain ruin\u201d, and it is the necessity of\navoiding some such ruin that motivates the supreme emergency story,\neven though it is collective rather than individual ruin that lies at\nits heart. Hobbes\u2019s exemption from the need to practice morality\n(rather than desire its operation) makes most sense on a contractarian\nview of morality or in connection with those moral obligations that\nare dependent upon agreement (even if other obligations are not). In a\nworld in which hardly anyone kept their promises or adhered to their\ncontracts, the sense of such commitments would dissipate and entering\ninto what shell remained of them might be folly indeed, and very\nlikely futile as well. But many other areas of morality are not like\nthis, and so even where adherence to moral imperatives may be perilous\nin the extreme, it may not be the folly that Hobbes\u2019s comments\nmake it seem. One woman who survived Belsen, Hanna Levy-Haas, records\nin her diary a philosophical debate she had in the camp with a fellow\nMarxist, Professor K who argued the somewhat Hobbesian case\n(embellished with Marxist terminology) that morality did not apply in\nthe camps because it was superseded by the survival imperative. She\nrejected his argument because it required her \u201csimply to\ncompromise with the enemy, to betray one\u2019s principles, to deny\nspiritual values in the interests of saving one\u2019s skin\u201d\n(Levy-Haas 1982, 65). These comments indicate at the very least that\nthe idea of \u201ctotal ruin\u201d is open to interpretations that\nsee the abandonment or degrading of moral integrity as itself a\nprimary ingredient in such ruin.\n\nThis excursion into the world of the Leviathan nonetheless helps give\nsome sense to the idea that the practice of morality might be\nsuspended for a time and hence morality itself moved aside by an\nexternal necessity. It thus helps show a way that the dirty hands\nstory might be redeemed from incoherence, even if the idea that\nmorality should sometimes be dominated by an external necessity proves\nunacceptable. The dirty hands position might then be coherent but\nfalse. So Hanna Levy-Haas could understand the Professor\u2019s\nargument, but found reason to reject it.\n4. A Conflict Within Morality?\n\nAnother route out of paradox would be to hold that the clash depicted\nby dirty hands theorists occurs within morality. Here, the idea might\nbe that morality itself is not entirely coherent or self-consistent.\nIn certain extreme circumstances, one powerful strand in morality\ncomes into conflict with another. Even more clearly, Weber\u2019s\ndistinction between the ethics of ultimate ends and that of\nresponsibility points in this direction. His idea is expressed\nsomewhat opaquely, but he seems to be claiming that there are two\nstrands in morality, or two types of morality, such that one may be\napplicable to ordinary life, but must yield to the other in matters\npolitical, especially those that involve difficult choices in a\ncontext of violence. Several passages in Walzer\u2019s discussion\ntend in this direction. He holds that a morality of rights and a\nmorality of consequences or utility co-exist in our moral outlook in\nsuch a way that although rights trump utility in normal circumstances,\na \u201cutilitarianism of extremity\u201d rightly overrides the\nmorality of rights in some rare circumstances. As he puts it: in a\nsituation of supreme emergency, \u201ca certain kind of\nutilitarianism reimposes itself\u201d, this being \u201cthe\nutilitarianism of extremity\u201d set against \u201ca rights\nnormality\u201d (Walzer 2004a, 40).\n\nThis contrast between a rights ethic (or other deontological ethic)\nand utilitarianism is one way of locating the clash within morality\nitself. Another way is by having recourse to role morality: within\nmorality itself there are general moral principles, rules etc. and\nthen special moral requirements dictated by significant social roles.\nThese can come into conflict, as when the lawyer\u2019s obligation to\nprovide her client with the best defence and to preserve\nconfidentiality can conflict with the demands of impartial justice. So\nit might be argued that the political role has obligations and rights\nspecial to it that override more general moral obligations and rights.\nWhen it comes to the immensely important role of political leadership,\nwe \u201ccannot measure such men by the ordinary rule\u201d as Lady\nCarbury puts it. This manoeuvre has the advantage of capturing\nsomething important in the dirty hands literature (and it is also\npresent in the realist literature), namely, the emphasis on the\nspecial moral significance of the role of political leadership.\nWalzer, for instance, places great weight upon \u201cwhat political\nleaders are for.\u201d Talking of political and military leaders, he\nsays, \u201cThe effect of the supreme emergency arguments should be\nto reinforce professional ethics, and to provide an account of when it\nis permissible (and necessary) to get our hands dirty\u201d (Walzer\n2004a, 42). An initial problem with this sort of move is that the\nspecial duties and rights of social roles are underpinned by general\nmoral considerations since it is only those roles that can be morally\nsupported by quite general moral considerations that will have a role\nmorality. We may describe the code of the Mafia thug as the morality\nof his role, but usually it is mores rather morality being described.\nEven if it is a requirement of his role that a Mafia hit-man must\nmurder anyone who snitches to the police, this is hardly a moral\nimperative of any sort. And where there are genuine moral duties to a\nrole, and they are endorsed by broader moral considerations, we do not\nbelieve that this endorsement cannot itself be overruled by other\ngeneral moral obligations. The requirements of professional\nconfidentiality, for instance, can be so overridden, as when medical\nconfidentiality regarding a doctor-patient communication stands in the\nway of saving a life. The famous Tarasof case is instructive in this\nrespect. It concerned a counsellor at the University of California at\nBerkeley who learned from his client that he planned to kill his\nex-girl friend. The counsellor was sufficiently worried that he broke\nconfidentiality to tell the police who investigated but took no\nfurther action. The girl friend (Tarasof) was duly murdered by the\nclient, and a court later held that the counsellor should have gone\nfurther and notified Tarasof or her family of the\n danger.[5]\n Other courts have been less demanding, but there is a general\nrecognition that the professional duty of client confidentiality can\nbe overridden by more pressing moral demands.\n\nIndeed, the structure of the role morality defence of the dirty hands\nstory provides a curious inversion of the role morality logic since\nthat logic requires that emergency situations allow or even demand the\noverturning of the role duties by the more general demands of a deeper\nmorality. By contrast, the dirty hands scenario requires the role\nmorality to triumph over the deeper moral outlook that gives sense to\nthe morality of role itself. Here we find yet another paradox\ngenerated by the dirty hands category. It could only be resolved by\nthe insistence that the political role is unique among roles since in\nits case its moral power somehow transcends the general morality. (Or,\nif the dirty hands scenario applies beyond the political, it will be\none of a small set of roles that is unique.) In fact, there is a\nstrong strand of this political exceptionism inherent in the dirty\nhands story. Yet how could the political role have such a status? We\nmight expect such an exaltation of the role from one such as Schmitt,\nbut in fact Walzer himself is drawn to it. Walzer\u2019s position has\nbeen cited as treating the dirty hands conflict as involving a clash\nbetween a rights ethic and a utilitarianism of extremity, but the\nfollowing quote puts his position much more in the role morality\narena. He says in his later treatment: \u201cNo government can put\nthe life of the community and all its members at risk, so long as\nthere are actions available to it, even immoral actions, that would\navoid or reduce the risk\u2026.That is what political leaders are\nfor; that is their first task\u201d (Walzer 2004a, 42). Furthermore,\nthe significance of this task is cashed out in terms of the supreme\nvalue of the specific \u201cmoral community\u201d to which the\npolitical leader belongs. The leader\u2019s obligations will involve\ncalculations of utility, but, in extremis, his or her ultimate\nresponsibility to that community trumps universalist utilitarian\ncalculations as well as specific deontological constraints. When the\n\u201congoingness\u201d of a community\u2019s way of life is\nthreatened then the prospect is that of \u201ca loss greater than any\nthat can be imagined, except for the destruction of humanity\nitself\u201d (Walzer 2004a, 43). These claims, if true, would\ncertainly establish a pre-eminent, if not unique, significance for the\npolitical role, so they need close examination.\n\nWalzer\u2019s two quotes stress significantly different values that\nhe has a tendency to conflate. The first is that of life itself for\nall members of the community, the second that of the continuity of a\n\u201cway of life\u201d. Survival is at issue in both cases but the\nsignificance and weight that each survival should have is surely very\ndifferent. The prospect of universal massacre understandably puts\nstress upon anything constraining the scope of actions to prevent it,\nbut the prospect of forced alterations, set-backs or radical changes\nto a way of life must be less threatening. Even a relatively benign\nforeign occupation may involve extensive and very regrettable changes\nto the way of life of the occupied community perhaps in the form of\nrestrictions on traditional freedoms, such as those of political\nspeech or religious expression, and a degraded position of citizenship\nvis-\u00e0-vis the occupiers. Yet throughout history modified life\nstyles have evolved for such communities that make for the possibility\nof at least coping and even some flourishing. It is not at all obvious\nthat slaughtering innocent people is justified in order to avoid such\nan outcome, or even outcomes notably worse on the same scale.\n\nEven if dirty hands were permitted only to political communities\nfacing extreme situations, it is not at all clear that the exemption\nshould only be available to political communities that have states.\nWalzer does not exactly say this, but his pro-state bias is evident in\nhis discussion of supreme emergency in Just and Unjust Wars.\nEarly in that discussion, he says, for instance, \u201cCan soldiers\nand statesmen override the rights of innocent people for the sake of\ntheir own political community? I am inclined to answer this question\naffirmatively, though not without hesitation and worry\u201d (Walzer\n1977, 254). Further, in a different essay on terrorism, Walzer rejects\narguments on behalf of terrorism by non-state agents that are very\nsimilar to those that he accepts as legitimating the bombing of German\ncities. For example, he claims that the familiar terrorist excuse that\nthey had no alternative in the face of oppression is only \u201ca\npretence.\u201d As he puts it: \u201c\u2018Last resort\u2019 has\nonly a notional finality; the resort to terror is ideologically last,\nnot last in an actual series of actions, just last for the sake of the\nexcuse\u201d (Walzer 2004b, 54). Yet no such scepticism is expressed\nabout the no alternative and last resort justifications offered by\ngovernments who use terrorism in supreme emergency.\n\nBut political communities other than states may surely face supreme\nemergencies, even allowing for the difficulties in interpreting the\nconcept, so the way is open in principle for sub-state terrorism to be\njustified. This is a position that Walzer somewhat reluctantly seems\nnow (in a parenthesis to a later reprinting of the terrorism article)\nto concede, though it goes somewhat against the grain of the article\nitself. The parenthetical comments, published in 2004, are:\n\u201cWould terrorism be justified in a \u2018supreme\nemergency\u2019 as that condition is described [by Walzer in the\nearlier chapter called \u2018Emergency Ethics\u2019]. It might be,\nbut only if the oppression to which the terrorists claimed to be\nresponding was genocidal in character\u201d (Walzer 2004b, 54). There\nare difficulties in matching the complex meanings of\n\u201cgenocide\u201d to Walzer\u2019s communitarian account of\nsupreme emergency. For one thing, a Nazi victory would probably not\nhave meant genocide for the British community yet, according to\nWalzer, they were facing supreme emergency. So, the sources of his\ndifferential treatment of state and sub-state terrorism remain a\npuzzle.\n\nHe goes on to deny that any actual recent terrorism has been \u201ca\nmeans for avoiding disaster\u201d rather than merely a\n\u201creaching for political success\u201d (Walzer 2004b, 54). So\nthe supreme emergency/dirty hands exemption seems available, given\nsignificant qualifications concerning probability of success, for\nterrorists aiming to save a communal way of life. In a later paper\nagain, Walzer allows for exceptional cases in which sub-state\nterrorism might be excusable though not justifiable; he imagines as\nexcusable \u201ca terrorist campaign by Jewish militants against\nGerman civilians in the 1940s\u2014if attacks on civilians had been\nlikely (in fact they would have been highly unlikely) to stop the mass\nmurder of the Jews\u201d (Walzer 2006, 7). The shift from justifiable\nin the earlier quotation to excusable in the later clearly needs more\nexplanation; Walzer seems hesitant, if not confused in his resort to\nthese categories. Nonetheless, on Walzer\u2019s own grounds, there\nwould seem to be a case, given some likelihood of success, for the\nemployment of terrorism by Palestinian groups seeking to salvage what\nremains of their community\u2019s way of life from the ravages of\nIsraeli occupation, settlement and military attack. It is perhaps\npertinent to this prospect that the Palestinians refer to their\ndispossession and ongoing sufferings at the hands of Israel as\n\u201cal-Nakba\u201d: the catastrophe. No doubt, their achieving\nthat prospect would involve some sort of \u201creaching for political\nsuccess\u201d but this hardly counts against its status as a response\nto supreme emergency. The point here is not to make any particular\nclaims about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but rather to stress\nthe idea, noted earlier, that Walzer\u2019s move to a criterion of\ngenocide is puzzling as the sole interpretation of what a threat to\nthe continuity of a communal way of life could mean.\n\nWalzer\u2019s tendency to run together the categories of excuse and\njustification needs some comment because it is symptomatic of the\ntensions inherent in the dirty hands scenario. He realises in the 1973\narticle that it is important to distinguish them. Citing J.L. Austin,\nWalzer remarks that \u201cthe two can seem to come very close\ntogether\u2026but they are conceptually distinct\u2026an excuse is\ntypically an admission of fault; a justification is typically a denial\nof fault and an assertion of innocence\u201d (Walzer 1973, 170;\nWalzer 1974, 72). Yet dirty hands acts involve both an admission of\nfault and a justification. This tends to collapse the distinction\nsince what is justified needs no excuse and the unjustifiable is\nsometimes excusable. Walzer\u2019s discussion for the most part\nclearly treats the dirty hands decisions as justified in some sense,\nwhatever is said about its role as excuse. It is notable that at least\none commentator, Tamar Meisels, explicitly rejects the account in\nterms of justification in her discussion of terrorism and torture but\nshe accepts dirty hands as providing grounds for excuse (Meisels\n2008a, 213\u2013221). Yet not only is this an unlikely interpretation\nof the tradition, but it renders the category of dirty hands far less\ninteresting philosophically and ethically.\n\nThe discussion of the importance and extent of political community\nleads naturally to the question whether the need for dirty hands can\nbe restricted to the political sphere. If hands must be dirtied to\navoid widespread massacre, on the one hand, or damage to the\nmoral-cum-political continuity of a community\u2019s way of life,\nthen why not to avoid the unjustified killing of individuals or small\ngroups or the drastic disruption of individual or small group\u2019s\nway of living. Why should the political community and the political\nrole take such dramatic precedence over such significant groups as\nfamilies and their associated roles? For that matter, why should it\ntake precedence over the individual\u2019s need for survival\nregardless of role? The answer to this is not entirely clear. In\nWalzer\u2019s discussion of supreme emergency and the World War II\ncity bombings, he confronts this question but his discussion is marked\nby what he himself calls \u201chesitation and worry\u201d. It is\nalso marked by appeals to what people are \u201clikely to\nfeel\u201d, \u201cwhat is not usually said\u201d and similar\nphrases. He says: \u201c\u2026it is not usually said of individuals\nin domestic society that they necessarily will or that they morally\ncan strike out at innocent people, even in the supreme emergency of\nself-defense. They can only attack their attackers. But communities,\nin emergencies, seem to have different and larger prerogatives. I am\nnot sure that I can account for the difference, without ascribing to\ncommunal life a kind of transcendence that I don\u2019t believe it to\nhave\u201d (Walzer 1977, 254). Nor, he thinks, can it simply be a\nmatter of the numbers. Yet he persists with the superiority of the\npolitical community: \u201cWe might better say that it is possible to\nlive in a world where individuals are sometimes murdered, but a world\nwhere entire peoples are enslaved or massacred is literally\nunbearable. For the survival and freedom of political\ncommunities\u2014whose members share a way of life, developed by\ntheir ancestors, to be passed on to their children\u2014are the\nhighest values of international society\u201d (Walzer 1977, 254).\nLeaving aside the quibble that an individual facing murder won\u2019t\nfind it possible to live on if she is actually murdered when perhaps\nshe refuses to kill the innocent in order to survive, we might\nquestion the sensitivity of ignoring the way any murder victim\u2019s\nclose relatives find her death unbearable and the prospect of living\non an agonising one. We might also wonder why \u201cwe\u201d\ndon\u2019t find it unbearable to slaughter hundreds of thousands of\ninnocent people to preserve the survival and freedom of our political\ncommunities. Nor is the reference to \u201cthe highest values of\ninternational society\u201d particularly compelling. Where\n\u201cinternational society\u201d refers to the society of states,\nas Walzer seems often to mean, then it is not surprising that such\nstates hold their survival as a pre-eminent value, but non-state\nagents may understandably have different priorities. A mother\nscrounging for the survival of her children in the desperate\nconditions of a third-world slum or primitive refugee camp may just as\nplausibly see herself coming under what Walzer calls, in connection\nwith political communities, \u201cthe rule of necessity (and\nnecessity knows no rules)\u201d (Walzer 1977, 254).\n5. The Scope of Dirty Hands and Some Significant Distinctions\n\nIn his original article on dirty hands, Walzer allows in passing that\nthe phenomenon he is exploring might have a place beyond politics. So,\nhe says: \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue that it is only a\npolitical dilemma. No doubt we can get our hands dirty in private life\nalso, and sometimes, no doubt, we should. But the issue is posed most\ndramatically in politics\u2026\u201d (Walzer 1974, 76). This\nconcession has, however, little influence on his developed position\nwhich is focused wholly on extreme emergency in political contexts.\n(The original article is, after all, called, \u201cPolitical Action:\nthe Problem of Dirty Hands\u201d.) Other writers have been puzzled by\nthe heavy concentration on politics. Michael Stocker, for one, rejects\nthis restriction (Stocker 2000, 32\u20133). Stocker also argues that\nthe dirty hands phenomena, though distinctive in various ways, exhibit\nquite common features of moral conflicts more generally, and partly\nfor this reason he thinks there is no logical incoherence in the dirty\nhands story. Stocker argues that what he calls double-counting, i.e.,\ngiving moral weight to impossible oughts, and allowing for\nnon-action-guiding act evaluations, is a central feature of dirty\nhands, but is not restricted to them since they occur \u201cacross\nthe board\u201d of moral thinking and deciding.\n\nHowever it should be located, the phenomenon of dirty hands can be\neasily assimilated to that of moral dilemma, but this is an\nassimilation that should be resisted. Someone confronted with a\nsupreme emergency is indeed in what is often colloquially called\n\u201ca moral dilemma\u201d in the sense that she faces a disturbing\nand difficult choice situation, but that does not make it a moral\ndilemma in a philosophically interesting sense. In common parlance all\nsorts of situations that cause initial uncertainty and require hard\nmoral thinking to sort out are called moral dilemmas, as philosophers\nwho teach or consult on business ethics are fully aware. This usage is\nharmless enough, but the philosophical usage of the term points to a\nmore disturbing situation and one that needs to be distinguished from\ndirty hands. Both the categories of dirty hands and moral dilemma\ninvolve agonising choice in which there will be grave moral loss\neither way. The most salient difference between the categories is that\na moral dilemma arises only when the choice is such that neither horn\nis decisively supported by morality, indeed morality speaks equally\nagainst both. (There is a parallel dilemma for non-moral normative\ncontexts, if there be any, where normative reasons speak equally\nagainst doing p or doing not-p.) Whichever way the\nagent chooses, her action is unjustified and there is no question of\none course being more necessary or demanded than the other. By\ncontrast, the dirty hands choice is always dictated as the\n\u201cnecessary\u201d course: in the context of political\nemergencies, the community defence always wins the day even over\ninnocent lives. This is the special feature that marks off dirty hands\nfrom moral dilemmas.\n\nA relatively unexplored question concerns whether anything more\ninformative than a reference to \u201cemergency\u201d, supreme or\notherwise, can be provided to illuminate the typical circumstances in\nwhich it is claimed that hands must be dirtied. One line of\nclarification that might be attempted would be to scrutinise more\ncarefully various broad situations in which moral action might be\nespecially under strain in political contexts. A first suggestion\nmight be that politics is essentially a zone of compromise, and it is\nthe pressure of compromise that creates the need for dirty hands. It\nis certainly true that compromise is a pervasive feature of political\nlife, but compromise is hardly unique to politics, nor is it\nnecessarily a pressure for immoral conduct. Indeed, it is arguable\nthat the capacity to compromise is an essential moral ingredient in\nall successful cooperative endeavours, since, apart from its\ninstrumental value, it shows respect for other reasonable participants\nin public action. Nonetheless, compromise clearly has its morally\ndangerous side as indicated by our use of \u201ccompromised\u201d to\ncharacterise someone whose principles have been sullied to an extent\nthat makes them untrustworthy. Since a compromise is a sort of bargain\nwhere parties sacrifice some good objectives in order to gain others,\nit raises a question about how far such deals can go, and this brings\nus into dirty hands territory. Another situation, related to our\nearlier discussion of Hobbes, is that of moral isolation. As noted\nthere, the fact that general adherence to morality has to a\nconsiderable degree broken down, might not give as great a\ndispensation from moral constraints as Hobbes supposes, but at least\nit poses starkly the rationale for compliance. A third situation that\nseems relevant here and needs further exploration is that of\nextrication. Politicians, and others, often find themselves in\nsituations where they have inherited, or are otherwise constrained by,\nthe decisions and policies of others (or even their previous selves)\nthat they now judge unwise or even gravely immoral. So, for example,\nthey may seek to end an unjust war to which their predecessors have\ncommitted the nation, but immediate cessation and withdrawal may not\nbe desirable from several perspectives, including a moral point of\nview. They may very well think that the best extrication strategy\nrequires a temporary continuation of the war, unjust as it is, with a\nview to a withdrawal that better secures the rights of innocent people\nand makes the withdrawal politically possible. Obviously, what such\nsituations might allow in terms of continued immorality needs to be\nspelled out in more detail than space allows here, but equally, it\nseems clear that there is a potential for dirty hands discussion that\nmoves fruitfully beyond the often-vague generalities of\n\u201cemergency\u201d or \u201cextremity\u201d.\n\nSome recent discussions that are relevant to dirty hands problems are\nconcerned with what C\u00e9cile Fabre has called \u201csecond best\u201d\nmoral justifications. In her book on the ethics of spying she argues\nthat although spying activities can involve acts generally considered\nas morally wrong, such as blackmail, unwanted covert surveillance, and\neven treachery or treason, a resort to acts such as these can be\nmorally justified in some contexts of gathering intelligence in a just\ncause. She qualifies this, however, in various ways including\ndisqualifying such resorts when the cause for which the spying is\nundertaken is unjust. So, when discussing espionage activities by a\nnation and its agents to discover important secrets of another nation\nthat they have unjust designs upon, such as waging an immoral war, she\nfirmly denies such a nation the right to use those activities. If, for\nexample, a nation A is planning an unjust war against\nnation B it would be morally unjustified in spying on a\nsuspected cyber facility of B\u2019s with a view to\ndestroying it, even if the facility is likely to be used\nagainst A (either as a pre-emption or in a later\nretaliation). Yet even here, A may be \u201csecond\nbest\u201d morally justified, indeed even have a moral duty, in\nundertaking such spying where it might lead to discovering that the\nfacility is a civilian one and morally should not be targeted. That\nA\u2019s spying reveals the facility to be civilian and\nthus A refrains from attacking it is a sort of moral plus in\nits overall dark moral position in the matter. Fabre insists,\ntherefore, that this second best moral justification allows A\nto proceed but leaves a \u201cmoral taint\u201d\non A\u2019s action since it shouldn\u2019t be undertaking\nspying on Green at all in pursuit of an unjust intervention. This\nmoral taint is a clear echo of the dirty hands story. \n\nAnother discussion with such an echo occurs in Tadros 2020, which\nendorses participating in a war that you know to be unjust in order to\nensure that the war is fought with greater restraint (p. 55). Tadros\nmakes no mention of \u201cmoral taint\u201d and may see the choice\nas morally straightforward if unusual. It seems possible, however, to\nsee it as involving dirty hands and the \u201cmoral taint\u201d of\nparticipating in an unjust war, even for achieving some amelioration\nof the injustice. Either way, a difficulty with the position is that\nit\u2019s hard to see how an individual enlisting in such a war could\nseriously imagine that they could have such an effect in a way that is\nremotely proportional to the extensive moral violations their\ninvolvement requires them to commit or condone, especially given the\nhighly authoritarian structures of armed forces. Those structures mean\nthat the individual would be under regular extreme pressure to kill\nenemy soldiers he has no moral right to harm, as well as the highly\nlikely possibility of similar pressure to kill enemy civilians either\ndirectly or indirectly. Of course, the story might be different if the\nindividual were conscripted to fight in an unjust war and made the\nsecond best of it by doing what they could to minimise the harms they,\nand others, did. This could also come under the heading of extrication\nmorality if they also aimed to extricate themselves by, for instance,\nseeking opportunities to desert.\n\nThe discussion of extrication raises another point about dirty hands\nthat is seldom addressed. Dirty Hands scenarios are often constructed\nvery specifically as giving the agent narrow choices restricted by\nexternal circumstances over which she has no present control. The\nspecific scenario is often then generalised as though those external\ncircumstances, or ones very like them, are immutable for an agent with\nthat sort of background (e.g., a politician). This is, however,, too\nstatic and inflexible a view of moral contexts, roles and agent\ncapacities. In the extrication story discussed earlier, the\npolitician\u2019s \u201cnecessary immorality\u201d is forced upon\nher by the circumstances she has created or inherited, but the point\nof invoking extrication morality within the dirty hands problematic is\nto insist on possibilities of temporary involvement in evil and the\nneed to change the circumstances that require such involvement. The\nruler bent on extrication must persist in waging an unjust war only\nbecause at that time there is no other way that she can end the war by\nchanging the context. But this restriction should be seen here and in\nother dirty hands situations as creating a moral imperative for the\nagent or others to change the background against which the moral\ncrisis has arisen so that similar situations are unlikely to recur. In\nthe unjust war example, the politician might use eventual success in\nending the war to change colonial or neo-colonial policies that fed\nthe resort to war, to remove over-belligerent personnel from the\ndefence establishment, rethink alliances that played a part in\npromoting the unjust war, and so on. Courage, imagination and luck may\nbe needed to realise the relevant possibilities, but without making\nefforts at relevant changes, the agent\u2019s appeal to necessity\nwhen invoking the dirty hands plea should ring hollow.\n6. The Dirty Hands of Citizens\n\nMost of the discussion of dirty hands concentrates upon the situation\nof the individual political leader who must dirty his or her hands,\nbut another interesting question concerns the dirt on the hands of\ncitizens themselves when their leaders act thus on their behalf. This\nis particularly acute for democratic citizens to whom representative\ntheory applies more plausibly than to citizens of an autocracy. In\nWalzer\u2019s original discussion, he insists that part of the\ntension, even agony, of the dirty hands problem arises from the fact\nthat we, the governed, want our leaders to be virtuous, but also want\nthem to have the sort of character that can act against deep moral\nprinciple when the supreme emergency arises. Of the politician who\ndirties his hands in a good cause but realises he is acting immorally,\nWalzer writes: \u201cBecause he has scruples of this sort we know him\nto be a good man. But we\u2026hope that he will overcome his\nscruples\u2026We know he is doing right when he makes the deal\nbecause he knows he is doing wrong\u201d (Walzer 1973, 166; 1974,\n68). But if so, our endorsement would seem to have some implication\nfor our own hands. This is not an implication that Walzer fully\nexplores, though he does say in the last sentence of his original\narticle when discussing the need to penalise dirty hands that we\ncan\u2019t punish the dirty hands of the principal agents\n\u201cwithout getting our own hands dirty, and then we must find some\nway of paying the price ourselves\u201d (Walzer 1973, 180; 1974,\n82).\n\nVarious other writers have however explored the implication, either\ndirectly or as part of the discussion of the supposed need to\n\u201cpunish\u201d dirty hands (for this topic see below). Most\nrecently David Archard complains that \u201c\u2026there has been\nlittle discussion of the putative complicity, and thus also dirtying\nof hands, of a democratic public that authorizes politicians to act in\nits name\u201d (Archard 2013, 777). Here he echoes an earlier\nposition taken by Martin Hollis and also similar claims made by Dennis\nThompson. As Hollis puts it: \u201cPolitical actors, duly appointed\nwithin a legitimate state, have an authority deriving finally from the\nPeople. Currently that means from you and me.\u2026 When their hands\nget dirty, so do ours\u201d (Hollis 1996, 146\u20137). Like Walzer\nthey assume that somehow the ruled require the rulers to dirty their\nhands, and this opens the way to distribute some degree of\nresponsibility or \u201cdirt\u201d to them.\n\nTaking Walzer\u2019s claim first, it is not at all obvious that\n\u201cwe\u201d want or hope that our leaders will violate deep moral\nprohibitions where they judge it necessary to achieve important\npolitical ends or avoid very bad outcomes, even if they remain\nconscious of their wrongdoing. No doubt some of us do and some of us\ndon\u2019t, but the issue is not really one of counting the\npreponderance of desire in the community; it is rather whether there\nis something inherent in the relation of the democratic citizenry to\nits leadership that authorizes the leaders to dirty their hands in the\nrelevant way. Archard explicitly argues for such an authorization,\nclaiming that it is this authorization that gives the citizens a share\nin the taint of dirty hands. Hollis, Dennis Thompson, Neil Levy and\nJanna Thompson rely upon some similar link.\n\nBut what exactly is this the nature of this authorization? It must be\nmore than simply giving certain people the authority to govern on our\nbehalf since that seems compatible with implicit or explicit\nrestrictions upon what they can or cannot do. Clearly, Archard needs\nsome strengthening of what the authorization allows; he tries to\nachieve this by using the idea of a division of labor. Specifically,\nhe argues that there is a both a political and a moral division of\nlabor (Archard 2013, 782). The political is relatively\nuncontroversial: it is the thesis that efficiency is best served by\nthe legitimate, multiple tasks required in a community being divided\nand the task of governing is one of them. This makes no further\nnormative claims about restrictions or entitlements related to the\nexercise of those tasks, and is compatible with most forms of\ngovernment. The moral division asserts that the different roles in\nsociety carry with them different moral prerogatives and duties\nappropriate to the different roles. But whatever the merits of such\nrole morality, it is not clear that it permits rulers to do anything\nat all that they believe will fulfill the purposes of their role.\nCombining the idea of role with that of authorization cannot show that\nthe authorized role player is entitled to use whatever means he or she\njudges the only effective way of achieving the role\u2019s purposes.\nIf it did, then authorizing a debt collector would seem to imply that\nthe agent may torture the debtor if that is the only way to collect a\nsignificant debt.\n\nIt might be conceded that this is ludicrous in the debt-collecting\nexample, but that the political role is different because of the very\nhigh stakes, not only for the politicians, but for the democratic\ncitizens. Yet we have already seen that it is hard to contain the\ndirty hands story within the realm of the political, and very few\npolitical decisions are momentous enough to give politics a status\nsufficiently privileged to exempt its practitioners, through that\nrole, from those deep moral constraints that restrict the\ndebt-collector or other agents in non-political life. Indeed,\nconsciousness of these facts helps explain why Walzer has\nprogressively tightened the conditions in which dirty hands apply. So\nthe question about authorization must focus on whether\n\u201cwe\u201d can plausibly be said to have authorized violations\nof deep moral principle in supreme emergency situations. Dennis\nThompson insists we do when he says that the dirty hands politician\nacts \u201cnot only for us, but with our consent\u2014not only in\nour name but on our principles\u201d (Thompson 1987, 18).\n\nThis confident answer to the question is not however supported by\nargument or even survey, and seems to assume unanimity amongst the\n\u201cwe\u201d of a pluralistic, democratic community that is\nunlikely to obtain. Dennis Thompson relies upon the legitimacy of the\ndemocratic process and citizens\u2019 assent to its outcomes, but,\naside from any general problems with consent theory, the ruler\u2019s\ndirty hands acts are often enough illegal or unconstitutional, as in\nthe case of torture, or in violation of declared policies that got the\nruler elected. Moreover, what we want of our political leaders will\npresumably depend upon who \u201cwe\u201d are and what moral and\npolitical principles \u201cwe\u201d hold. Suppose a dirty hands\ndecision has been made by the leaders to torture an innocent child in\norder to extract information from the child\u2019s radical parent\nabout a \u201cticking bomb\u201d (and suppose that this is a genuine\ndirty hands decision and not one flawed by lack of knowledge or\nignoring of preferable alternatives) then it is plausible to hold that\nthose citizens who think that the moral politician should violate his\n(and their) deep moral objections to torture in such circumstances\nmust share in the guilt or shame that should attach to the politician.\nBut there will surely be many citizens who either think that the moral\nviolation should not have occurred, even in these circumstances, or\nwho think that the prohibition is not as deep as commonly supposed and\nhence that the politician\u2019s decision is right but not immoral.\nIt is implausible to hold that both these groups are implicated in\ndirty hands in the way Archard and others suggest that all democratic\ncitizens, merely by being citizens, are.\n\nMoreover there is a further question underlying the question of\nconsent or authorization or expectation, namely that concerning what\nwe ought to want, expect or authorize and what principles we ought to\nhave. This is the question whether politicians ought to get their\nhands dirty, in any sense of \u201cought\u201d that carries ultimate\nweight. If the politicians are right (in certain, presumably extreme,\ncircumstances) to dirty their hands and they are right to do it on our\nbehalf, then at least those of us who agree that it is right are\ninvolved in what they do and have some responsibility for it. Indeed,\nwe are more than tainted, we are complicit.\n\nEmphasizing the shared guilt of citizens has implications for a\nfurther issue, concerned with how the dirty hands perpetrator should\nbe treated after the event. Walzer argues that the politician\u2019s\ngenuine guilt means that she should suffer a penalty or a shaming for\nhaving done what \u201cwe\u201d want her to do (Walzer 1973,\n177\u20138; 1974 79\u201380). Others have taken a similar line\nthough the position has been criticized by, for example, Tamar Meisels\nand Neil Levy (Meisels 2008a, 227 and Levy 2007 throughout). There are\nserious problems about moral responsibility in claiming that a dirty\nhands agent who does what is morally wrong because he must should be\npunished or publicly disgraced. After all, if the freedom to act is a\nprecondition of moral responsibility and therefore blame, then the\ndirty hand agent who does what is (all-things-considered) necessary\nand somehow right seems immune to the criticism involved in blame.\n(For further elaboration of this and related objections see Levy 2007;\nalso Meisels 2008a, 226\u201327.) The point here, however, is that,\neven if it is proper to blame and shame for dirty hands, then, on the\nsupposition that all citizens share in the taint, selecting only one\nto shame seems distinctly unjust, indeed massively hypocritical. While\nthe rest of us rejoice and celebrate the happy consequences of our\nagent\u2019s necessary misdeed, she is shunned or worse. As already\nnoticed, Walzer does think that punishing the dirty hands conduct of\nthe principal agents makes our own hands dirty (though he\ndoesn\u2019t seem to think that our original authorization of the\nconduct does this). He doesn\u2019t elaborate the point, but it opens\nup intriguing prospects since presumably we dirty \u201cour\u201d\nhands in punishing these agents precisely because, in some sense, they\nare \u201cinnocent\u201d or at least do not deserve punishment\nbecause they have acted \u201crightly\u201d. This opens up bizarre\npossibilities of regress since \u201cwe\u201d now should have to pay\na further price for inflicting a price on ourselves when we have done\nthe right (but immoral) thing in punishing ourselves, and so on and\non. It seems the spreading of responsibility for dirty hands to the\ngoverned community merely adds to worries about the coherence of the\nconcept.\n\nClaims of shared guilt or taint raise further questions about the\nresponsibility that democratic citizens as well as their leadership\nhave for remedying the evil done to the victims of the dirty hands\ndecision. Stephen de Wijze (de Wijze, 2018) argues that not only must\nthe leadership try to justify their decision to their constituents,\nbut they and all their democratic citizens are liable to make\nrestitution to victims for the \u201cnecessary\u201d harm done by\nthe dirty hands decision. Admittedly, he thinks that that although the\ncitizens are complicit their \u201cmoral pollution\u201d is\ngenerally less than the leadership. Even so, they are obliged to make\namends to the victims of the decision. All citizens, he argues, even\nthose dissenting from the decision, must \u201cshare in the moral\nburden, and contribute to the appropriate restitution\u201d (de\nWijze, 2018, 144). So they must pay \u201csome penalty\u201d perhaps\nin the form to increased taxation to effect reparations.\n\nThe claim that all democratic citizens are so obliged needs some\nunpacking since there is clearly a difference in liability for those\nwho enthusiastically supported or were indifferent to the dirty hands\ntactic and those who opposed it. There is some plausibility in the\nclaim that even strongly dissenting democratic citizens incur some\nrestorative and other moral obligations as a result of their\nleaders\u2019 dirty hands behaviour, but support for this claim need\nnot resort to dubious extensions of the idea of collective guilt or\nmoral taint. Membership in a democratic political community (or even\nin some non-democratic ones) creates a set of relationships that\ninvolve forms of identification such that a degree of pride can be\ntaken in good decisions by the leadership and by fellow citizens and a\ndegree of shame or alienation at bad ones. None of this means that the\ndissenting citizen is in any way morally responsible for those\ndecisions, but what it may mean is that the dissenting citizen has\nsome special moral responsibility to criticise those decisions,\nincluding the dirty hands ones that she rejects, and to do what is\npossible, in spite of her lack of pollution or guilt, to repair the\nbad effects. Responsibility for bad acts should be distinguished from\nresponsibility to remedy or compensate for them, though it is a\ncomplex matter how to sketch the lineaments of this distinction.\n7. The Issue of Absolutism\n\nBoth dirty hands and moral dilemmas challenge the idea that some moral\nprohibitions or negative duties are \u201cabsolute\u201d though they\ndo so in different ways. If we deny that there are moral rules or\nprohibitions that stand whatever the context, then it will not be\nsurprising that deep moral prohibitions may be legitimately overridden\nin some circumstances. Indeed, many contemporary moral theories, other\nthan utilitarianism, insist that such overruling remains a permanent\npossibility. The intuitionism of W.D. Ross and his followers, for\ninstance, insists that all duties and obligations are prima facie. It\nis always possible that the prima facie duty not to kill the innocent\nwill clash with some other prima facie duty, such as the duty to\npromote wellbeing or the ruler\u2019s duty to preserve the state or\nprotect the community, and then one\u2019s actual duty will be the\noutcome of weighing the respective force of the clashing prima facie\nduties. One might thus see the dirty hands story as merely a version\nof this outlook, a version that insists that only a very great\nweighting on the other side of the balance can tip the scales against\nsome very significant prima facie obligations. Using terminology of\nThomas Nagel\u2019s, dirty hands would instantiate \u201cthreshold\ndeontology\u201d with a very high threshold for certain action types.\nTo make this assimilation would be to take much of the sting out of\nthe dirty hands story, both because dirty hands would be part of a\nmore commonplace moral perspective rather than a quite special ethic\nfor emergencies, and because there seems to be no room in threshold\ndeontology, or what has been called \u201cbalanced\nexceptionism\u201d (Coady 2004, 778\u20139; Coady 2008, 285\u20137,\n299). for the idea that one has done wrong in doing what is\nnonetheless right. There may be a sense of regret that one cannot\navoid doing something that was prima facie wrong\u2014it would be\nmore comfortable if one\u2019s prima facie duties did not conflict\nand therefore need resolution\u2014but no wrong can be attributed to\nyou if you have done the balancing\n conscientiously.[6]\n The balanced exceptionist can of course acknowledge that some prima\nfacie duties are stronger than others, and hence some presumptive\nwrongs carry more heft than others. Indeed, the balancing story\ncommits its supporters to this acknowledgement since there would be no\npoint to the talk of balancing as a procedure for decision unless\nthere were such differences of weight. But the fact remains that the\ngranting of exemption from the prohibition on intentionally killing\nthe innocent is part of a normal, even routine, business of balancing\npresumptive obligations in order to find what is finally obligatory or\nprohibited. If the scales tell you that it is morally permitted or\neven morally obligatory intentionally to kill the innocent, then in\nthese circumstances it cannot be wrong to do\n so.[7]\n\nIn fact, there is an interesting comparison here with utilitarianism.\nAs we have seen, it is common to contrast balanced exceptionism or\nthreshold deontology with utilitarianism and to establish dirty hands\nas a form of deontology (or intrinsicalism) that yields to the\nutilitarianism of extremity. But there may be room for a utilitarian\nversion of the threshold story, even possibly the dirty hands story.\nSurely a sophisticated version of utilitarianism, such as rule or\nindirect utilitarianism, can have room for the idea that duties,\nvirtues etc. cannot be overridden by ordinary calculations of utility\nsince to allow this would be to risk too much overall disutility. It\nis only in situations of dire or \u201csupreme\u201d emergency that\nthe disutility of abiding by the prohibitions or rules would be great\nenough to override the utilitarian value of keeping to the\n rule.[8]\n So, depending upon the empirical facts and calculations, a\nutilitarian can admit a role for thresholds, supreme emergencies, and\neven dirty hands. But while this might give us a utilitarian version\nof threshold deontology, it will not do as a version of dirty hands,\nsince the utilitarian overriding at the supreme emergency stage will\ninvolve a decision that is simply right, and not in any sense right\nbut still wrong. The only sense in which it remains wrong is that weak\nsense, akin to that attributed to Ross in endnote 35, in which it\nwould have been wrong but for the supreme emergency. For the\nutilitarian, (as indeed for Ross) there is no real moral remainder,\nthough there may be some room for psychological discomfort.\n\nThe moral remainder and the remorse it generates signals the tribute\nthat dirty hands pays to moral absolutism. While actually rejecting\nmoral absolutes, the dirty hands theorist remains entranced by the\nsignificance they give to certain moral constraints. But how do we\ndecide whether moral absolutism should be rejected? It is difficult in\nthe nature of the case to see what could resolve a dispute between\nabsolutists and non-absolutists. Absolutists do not typically regard\nall moral prohibitions as absolute; they restrict their claim to a few\nsuch prohibitions, such as those against intentional killing of the\ninnocent, rape and (for some theorists) torture. Their opponents claim\nthat, even for these cases, emergency scenarios can be imagined in\nwhich \u201cour\u201d intuitions accept the legitimacy of such acts.\nWhere absolutists don\u2019t reject the scenarios as merely fantastic\n(as some certainly are), they simply have different intuitions about\nthe force of the examples. Moreover, they can point out that most\nmoral theorists, including their opponents, are absolutists about some\nmoral issues. Utilitarians allow no exceptions \u201cwhatever the\ncircumstances\u201d to their basic rule of maximising satisfactory\noutcomes, Rawlsian contractualism gives an absolute priority to\ncertain principles of liberty, and similar points apply to other\ntheories normally opposed to absolutism. It might be replied that the\nlevel at which absolutism applies is different, and this is true since\nthe absolutist endorses specific moral prohibitions such as that on\nmurder or torture whereas the other theories are usually absolute at a\nmore abstract level. Yet it is unclear why this is an important\ndifference, or why, if it is, it should count against the absolutist.\nAfter all, it is surely plausible that our conviction that murder or\ntorture is always wrong has more authority than any conviction that we\nshould always maximise the greatest happiness of the greatest number\nor always maximise preference satisfaction. Moreover, some specific\nmoral prohibitions seem proof against even fantastic counter-examples,\ne.g., the principle that it is wrong to torture an innocent child for\nfun. But, even here, it may be hazardous to underestimate the\ningenuity of philosophers in constructing bizarre counter-examples.\nClearly, more remains to be said about the nature of a defensible (or\nobjectionable) absolutism, but our discussion at least serves to\nindicate the significance of absolute prohibitions for the framing of\ndirty hands scenarios.\n\nA further interesting issue about absolutism is its common association\nwith some versions of religious ethics, especially the\nJudeo-Christian. Certainly, there seems to be a strong element of it\nin traditional Catholic moral theology, and Elizabeth Anscombe, who\nwas a committed Catholic of a theologically conservative cast of mind,\nwrote an influential article (1958) which was, inter alia, an\nearly contemporary defence of absolutism against the balanced\nexceptionism of much (she thought all) of the then current moral\nphilosophy. Anscombe tied the notion of moral obligation in the use of\n\u201cought\u201d and \u201cought not\u201d to the concept of\nDivine Law the increased unfashionability of appeal to the commands of\nwhich in connection with obligation having palpably diminished outside\nreligious circles (Anscombe 1958).  Even within those circles,\nhowever, there are problems with a Divine Command ethic as an\nendorsement of absolutism. One can be illustrated through the Biblical\nstory of Abraham\u2019s response to God\u2019s command that he\nshould kill and sacrifice to God his son Isaac. In the Akedah, as the\ntale is often named, Abraham complies until a messenger from God stays\nhis hand at the last moment. Since the intentional killing of an\ninnocent child is a prime example of the absolutely forbidden for\nAnscombe and others there is an obvious incompatibility between a\ndivine command ethic in general and this particular command from God\nthat Abraham is so ready to obey. Exegetes have had various\nexplanations of Abraham\u2019s situation and this is not the place to\nexplore them, other than to point to the primary difficulty of\nGod\u2019s commanding Abraham to to form and begin to put into action\nthe intention to murder his child.\n\nIt is noteworthy that at least one Catholic scholar Evan Sandsmark has\nargued forcefully that the rejection of dirty hands, implicit and\nexplicit the Catholic theological absolutist moral tradition is\nmistaken, and moreover acceptance of the dirty hands category is\nconsistent with absolutism, and even requires it, thereby reinforcing\nthe relevance of my earlier point about the tribute that dirty hands\npays to absolutism. His argument is that the moral taint that is\nessential to the dirty hands act of necessity is best explained by its\ninvolving a guilty violation of an absolute prohibition. Since the\nprohibition remains absolute though the violator has by hypothesis\ndone the right thing then the agent must be remorseful and seek\npenance and appropriate recompense for the offence. Sandsmark\u2019s\ningenious argument strains the sense of the term\n\u201cabsolute\u201d since some sort of \u201cnecessity\u201d\nmakes the prohibition no longer absolutely binding, bringing it nearer\nto Igor Primoratz\u2019s \u201calmost absolute\u201d category in\nconnection with the prohibition of terrorist acts of intentionally\nkilling the innocent (Primoratz, 2013, 110\u2013113). It also seems\nto inherit the problem discussed earlier in this entry about\nseparating the overwhelming dirty hands necessity from morality only\nat the possible cost of achieving coherence at the cost of\nfalsity. \n\nWalzer\u2019s attitude to absolutism is (as it has to be) one of\nrespectful rejection. He says: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\nterrorism can ever be justified. But I also don\u2019t want to defend\nan absolute ban. \u2018Do justice though the heavens fall\u2019 has\nnever seemed to me a plausible moral position\u201d (Walzer 2006, 7).\nElsewhere, he says, after claiming that absolutism is \u201cvery old,\nperhaps older than anything else in our moral understanding\u201d,\nthat at the point of disaster or supreme emergency \u201cabsolutism\nrepresents, it seems to me, a refusal to think about what it means for\nthe heavens to fall\u201d (Walzer 2004a). Such a refusal can indeed\nbe represented as obtuse, but when we come to cash out contemporary\nthinking about falling heavens we might think about the issue of\ntorture, an issue that was one of Walzer\u2019s earliest examples\ngenerating dirty hands. The easy acceptance since September 11, 2001,\namongst some intellectuals of the recourse to torture in situations of\nemergency, frequently it would seem far short of\n\u201csupreme\u201d, has raised questions of the relevance of\nabsolutism even on the part of those who had previously endorsed dirty\nhands or exceptionism of some sort. So, Henry Shue, for instance,\nalways a strong opponent of torture, had nonetheless allowed in his\noriginal treatment of the issue that torture might be morally\npermissible in certain \u201cextreme\u201d circumstances (Shue\n1977\u201378). But in a later, Shue criticises his own admission and\nthe widespread intellectual acceptance of torture in extremis as a\nresort to \u201cdreamland\u201d (Shue 2006). By this he means that\nthe philosophers\u2019 stories about \u201cticking bomb\u201d\nscenarios are basically fantasies that distract from the reality of\nmoral assessment in the real world. Shue\u2019s opposition is now, as\na matter of practice, resolute and absolute. Others have also\nexpressed a commitment to a sort of absolutism in connection with\ntorture. Bob Brecher, for example, provides a criticism of the ticking\nbomb scenario (which is basically the scenario Walzer uses in his\noriginal paper on dirty hands) and from a purely consequentialist\nperspective endorses the need for an absolute condemnation of torture\n(Brecker 2007). As mentioned earlier, Igor Primoratz somewhat\nsimilarly recognises the pull of absolutism about some moral\nimperatives and argues for \u201calmost absolute.\u201d So the\ndebate about torture largely engendered by the \u201cwar on\nterror\u201d has revived interest in the credentials of moral\nabsolutism, although much about the nature and types of absolutism\nremain in need of clarification. In any event, there is clearly reason\nto approach the topic of dirty hands with a degree of suspicion\nregarding Lady Carbury\u2019s enthusiasm for \u201cbeneficent\naudacity\u201d and her contempt for measuring exceptional people by\nthe \u201cordinary rule\u201d appropriate to the rest of us.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Acheson, Dean, 1965, \u201cEthics in International Relations\nToday\u201d, in M.G.
