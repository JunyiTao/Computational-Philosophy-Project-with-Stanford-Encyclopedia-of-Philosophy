    "main_text": "Theories of Color || Color Relationalism\n2.6 Action-Based Theories of Color\n\nThere are other forms of color relationalism which deserve a section\nof their own. They tend to see colors as hybrid properties combining\naspects of the perceiver\u2019s environment and phenomenology.\n\nOne form has links to action-based theories of perception, as\ndeveloped principally by the psychologist, J. J. Gibson. A leading\nexample is the theory defended by Evan Thompson, The Ecological\nView of Colors. On this account, colors are taken to be\ndependent, in part, on the perceiver and so are not intrinsic\nproperties of a perceiver-independent world. Being colored, instead,\nis construed as a relational property of the environment, connecting\nthe environment with the perceiving animal. In the case of the color\nof physical surfaces, \u201cbeing coloured corresponds to the surface\nspectral reflectance as visually perceived by the animals\u201d\n(Thompson 1995: 240; see also Ch. 5, pp. 242\u2013250).\n\n\nIn more detail this account is spelled out in the following way: \n\n\nbeing coloured a particular determinate colour or shade \u2026 is\nequivalent to having a particular spectral reflectance, illuminance,\nor emittance that looks that colour to a particular perceiver in\nspecific viewing conditions. (1995: 245) \n\n\nThompson insists that this account is to be distinguished from both a\nLockean dispositionalist account and an error theory of colors.\nWhether it is or not will depend on what account he can give of\n\u201cas visually perceived by the animal\u201d.\n\nAnother important example of an action-based approach to perception is\nthe theory in No\u00eb 2004. No\u00eb defends what he calls the\nenactive approach to perception. As in the case of Thompson, his\ntheory is guided by Gibson\u2019s work, albeit with modification.\nNo\u00eb sets his view of color within this account, arguing that\ncolor is a relational property, involving the object and the\nenvironment, and crucially related to perceivers. In his theory of\nperception, No\u00eb emphasizes the role of perspectival properties.\nHe distinguishes, for example, between size and perspectival size,\ni.e., size in the visual field or how things look with\nrespect to size from here.\n\n\nSize in the visual field is distinct property from size. It\ncorresponds to the size of the patch that one must fit in on given\nplane perpendicular to the line sight in order to perfectly occlude an\nobject from view. (No\u00eb 2004: 83) \n\n\nActually, No\u00eb makes a distinction between three kinds of\nproperties. Associated with the shape (and size) of an object, say, a\ncube, is its visual potential:\n\n\nThe visual potential of a cube (at least with respect to\nshape) is the way its aspect changes as a result of movement (of the\ncube itself or of the perceiver around the cube). Any movement\ndetermines a set of changes in perceived aspect; any set of changes in\nperceived aspects determines equivalent classes of possible movements,\n(No\u00eb 2004: 77) \n\n\nAccordingly, in the case of shape and size, we can distinguish between\nthree kinds of properties: e.g., vision-independent shape,\nshape\u2019s visual potential and perspectival shape. No\u00eb models\nhis theory of color on the second kind of property: \u201ccolors are\nways colored things change their appearances as color-critical\nconditions change\u201d (No\u00eb 2004: 141). This is an intriguing\ntheory. What isn\u2019t so clear is what exactly perspectival color\nis.\n\nMore recently, other forms of relational theories have emerged:\ntheories defended by Brogaard (2012), Chirimuuta (2015), and\nChirimuuta & Kingdom (2015). Chirimuuta advocates a version of\ncolor relationalism which she calls Color Adverbialism:\n\n\nOn this last account, colors are not properties of external physical\nobjects, or of brains, or of our mental states; instead, they are\nproperties of perceptual processes or interactions which involve\nobjects, brains and mental states. So, according to colour\nadverbialism, \u201cseeing the colours\u201d means \u201cseeing in\na colourful way\u201d. (Chirimuuta & Kingdom 2015: 226) \n\n\nShe appeals, with Kingdom, to recent research on color vision, relied\nto the function of color vision, to argue that it provides great\ndifficulties for Objectivist color realism\u2014both Primitivist and\nReductionist Physicalist\u2014(see also Akins & Hahn 2014). While\nthey admit that anti-realism, especially the form favored by Hardin,\nis in a better position, they think that Color Adverbialism presents\nthe best explanation.\n\nAnother important recent contributions to the philosophy of color is\nthe book by Matthen (2005). In this work, Matthen articulates a theory\nof sense-perception in which color plays a prominent role. The work is\nsignificant for the theory of color that he presents, one that draws\nheavily on comparative studies of color vision among different\nspecies. Matthen replaces his earlier objectivist views on color by an\naccount that has more in common with the ecological theory favored by\nThompson. Matthen agrees with Hardin, Thompson and others that the\nphenomenology of color is not captured, or accounted for, by any of\nthe standard objectivist accounts. Nevertheless, he claims to be\ndefending a realist theory of color and to be rejecting standard\nirrealist theories, including Hardin\u2019s. Matthen\u2019s account\nis complex. The idea is that the senses (the visual sensory system) do\ncategorize objects as \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cyellow\u201d, etc.,\nbut these qualities are related to actions that perceivers can\nperform, and in particular, to \u201cepistemic affordances\u201d.\nThe sensory systems are held to be devices that are in the business of\nclassifying distal stimuli (physical objects) as having certain\nproperties, which stand in similarity and difference relations with\neach other. These categories are constructed by the system and do not,\nat least in the case of color, correspond to any objective properties\nthat are independent of perceivers.\n",
