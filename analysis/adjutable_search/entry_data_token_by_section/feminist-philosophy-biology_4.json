    "main_text": "Feminist Analyses of Particular Areas of Biological Research || Sexual Selection\n3.1 Sexual Selection\n\n\nFeminist interventions regarding evolutionary models of sexual\nselection are important for at least two reasons. First, the role\nof female organisms in evolution was generally neglected or\nmisrepresented by biologists until the later part of the\n20th century. Second, these models provide theoretical\nfoundations for many biological accounts of human nature that support\nsexist and androcentric stereotypes, in particular accounts that\nportray women as passive and coy, and men as active and\npromiscuous.\n3.1.1 What is sexual selection?\n\n\nEvolution by natural selection happens when there are heritable\ndifferences among types of organisms in a population and, as a result\nof these differences, some types leave more offspring than\nothers. This leads to changes in the frequencies of those\ndifferent types of organisms in a population. Darwin described\nsexual selection in terms of \u201cthe advantage which certain\nindividuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in\nexclusive relation to reproduction (1871, vol. 1 256). In other\nwords, this advantage need not be one of physiological or mechanical\nefficiency or longevity, but rather concerns increasing reproductive\npotential. Darwin notes two kinds of sexual selection: male-male\ncompetition and female choice. This twofold characterization of\nsexual selection remains standard in current biological literature\nranging from academic publications to textbooks to the popular\npress. Darwin writes that \u201cthe male is generally eager to\npair with any female\u201d whereas females tend to choose the most\nattractive partner (1859, 70; 1871, 582). Darwin considered the\ncompetition among males \u201cfor the possession of the other\nsex\u201d to result in the improvement of sensory and locomotory\nfeatures and the development of strong passions.\n\n\nThis theme is carried through in his discussion in Sexual\nSelection in Relation to Man, in which hunting, defense of self\nand community, and competition for mates result in the development of\nmen's \u201cobservation, reason, invention and\nimagination.\u201d Women obtain these traits because they inherit them\nfrom their fathers. Darwin writes that \u201cIt is, indeed, fortunate\nthat the law of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes\nprevails with mammals; otherwise it is probable that man would have\nbecome as superior in mental endowment to women, as the peacock is in\nornamental plumage to the peahen\u201d (Darwin, 1871, 565). Whereas\nDarwin believed that male-male competition was generally thought to\nimprove the species, female choice resulted in the development of\nbeauty without utility: \u201ca great number of male animals\u2026\nhave been rendered beautiful for beauty's sake\u201d (Darwin\n1859, 371); \u201cthe most refined beauty may serve as a charm for the\nfemale, and for no other purpose\u201d (1871, vol. 2 92). In this\nview, the expensive and dangerous displays of the peacock are the\nresult of the preference of females for males with the most beautiful\ndisplay. It is worth noting that Darwin developed his notions of\nfemale choice to account for traits that seemed to be maladaptive from\nthe perspective of natural selection alone.\n\n\nSeveral feminist scholars, most especially Ruth Hubbard (1990), have\nclearly pointed out the close parallels of Darwin's account of\neager males competing with one another for access to reticent and\nchoosy females with Victorian gender values (see also, Fausto-Sterling\n1985/1992). It is also noted that the activity of choice Darwin\nascribed to females is caused by a female preoccupation with beauty and\nas such often has negative consequences for both male survival and the\nspecies itself. Nonetheless, feminists have revealed that Darwin\nwas exceptional for theorizing that female choice had any evolutionary\nconsequences at all. For example, as Helena Cronin (1991) points\nout, Darwin's contemporaries, especially Alfred Russell Wallace,\n(1) were skeptical that females had an aesthetic sense, (2) believed\nthat if they did have one, it was unlikely to be stable enough to\nresult in evolutionary change, (3) believed that female choice, if it\ndid exist, would be swamped out by natural selection, and finally (4)\nbelieved that the excessive male displays were likely the result of the\nexcess vigor possessed by male animals and not female choice.\nDarwin's theories of sexual selection and especially of female\nchoice languished for nearly a century.\n\n\nContemporary thought regarding sexual selection is heavily\ninfluenced by the work of biologists Angus Bateman and Robert\nTrivers. Bateman (1948) hypothesized that variance in\nreproductive success would be greater among males than among females.\nFemale reproduction is limited by the number of eggs a female produces\nand during a single reproductive cycle a female uses the sperm from one\nor a small number of copulations. According to Bateman's view,\nonce the female has garnered the sperm needed to fertilize her eggs,\nshe does not benefit from further mating. As a result a female ought to\nbe picky about who she mates with and since, according to the theory,\nsperm is never in short supply, all females are assumed to produce\nabout the same number of offspring. Male reproduction, on the other\nhand, is limited by the number of females that a male can\ninseminate. A male gains benefits from inseminating as many\nfemales as possible. This results in competition among males for access\nto females, with some males mating with many females and some males\nmating with few or no females. Bateman conducted an experiment\nwith fruit flies in which he found higher variance in male reproductive\nsuccess than female reproductive success.\n\n\nTrivers (1972) added considerations of parental care to\nBateman's argument. Trivers argues that females generally\ninvest more than males in reproduction, not only in terms of creating\nlarge eggs, but also in the development and care of offspring. As\na result, females ought to be even choosier regarding mates and become\nan even more limited resource for males. Again, it follows that males\nare motivated to mate with as many females as possible and females are\nmotivated to resist male advances in the hope of choosing the best mate\npossible. This is correlated with and reinforces stereotypes of\nmales as active, promiscuous, and competitive, and females as passive,\ncoy, and nurturing. The rhetoric of the coy female and the promiscuous\nmale is decreasing but is still common among many accounts of sexual\nselection.\n\n\nFeminist philosophers of biology are deeply concerned about the\nwholesale application of this model of sexual selection without\nempirically testing its underlying assumptions and investigating the\nrelationship between the underlying foundations of the model and\ncultural assumptions regarding gender. Whether or not it is\nintended to do so by researchers in the field, this model can offer\nsupport to current gender inequities. As Hubbard (1990, 110) points\nout, \u201cfrom the seemingly innocent asymmetries between eggs and\nsperm flow such major social consequences as female fidelity, male\npromiscuity, women's disproportional contribution to the care of\nchildren, and the unequal distribution of labour by sex.\u201d This\nmodel also provides a basis for arguments that rape is an evolved\nreproductive strategy among human males (Thornhill and Palmer\n2000). And E. O. Wilson (1978, 103) proposes that because of\narguments based on this model \u201ceven with identical education for\nmen and women and equal access to all professions, men are likely to\nmaintain disproportionate representation in political life, business,\nand science.\u201d\n3.1.2 Feminist interventions\n\n\nThe traditional theoretical perspective on sexual selection\ndescribed above is an elegant model. However, it relies on several\nassumptions in order to be applicable to actual cases. Hrdy\n(1986) has described three broad categories of assumptions needed to\nsuccessfully apply this model to real situations. The first\nassumption is that male investment in the production of offspring\nis small relative to female investment. Ruth Hubbard\n(1990) points out that the challenge here is determining the\nappropriate way to characterize and measure investment. Eggs are\nlarger than sperm. So, if one simply considers gamete size, male\ninvestment is smaller. However, males do not use a microscopic\neyedropper to dispense one sperm at a time. Hubbard questions\nwhether investment ought to be measured at the level of the individual\ngamete. When one includes the total amount of energy and resources that\nare need to produce sperm and semen, the energy required to develop and\nmaintain secondary sexual characteristics (differences between the\nsexes that are not directly linked to the reproductive system), the\ncosts of male-male competition, the costs that males of many species\ninvest in defending a territory, and the effort that the males of some\nspecies put into parental care, male costs may turn out to be higher\nthan researchers have historically expected. These male costs may\nbe further increased if one measures them over an individual's\nlifetime as opposed to a single reproductive event. It is\nimportant for researchers to justify their characterization of what\ncounts as investment.\n\n\nThe second assumption is that there is greater variance in male\nthan female reproductive success. While this is the case for\nmany species, (for example, Bateman's fruit flies), it is an\nempirical matter whether or not this applies to other species. In\nsome species, variance in female reproductive success is higher than\nhas been assumed and in some species, variance in male reproductive\nsuccess is lower than is often assumed. Hrdy (1981/1999, 1986)\npoints out that there has been a lack of attention to ways that a\nfemale can end investment in a particular reproductive attempt, for\nexample, female birds abandoning nests or spontaneous abortion among\nsome species of mammals. Attention also needs to be paid to the\neffects of a female's physiological condition and social status\non her reproductive output. Hrdy demonstrates that female\nprimates have an impressive array of active strategies that they employ\nto control their own reproduction. For example, competition and\nsystems of social alliances among female primates can lead to\nunexpected variance in female reproductive success. Hubbard\n(1990) allows that theoretically there could be greater variance in\nreproductive success among men than among women, but claims that\ngenerally most societies have the same number of men and women\nproducing children and do not operate using a few\n\u201csuper-studs.\u201d Hubbard points out that it remains to\nbe demonstrated that weaker men, however one would measure this\ncharacteristic, have fewer children than powerful men and that women\ntend to have similar numbers of children.\n\n\nThe final assumption is that the only evolutionary benefit of\nsex for females is fertilization. As Sterelny and Griffiths\n(1999) report, the power of the model decreases as the gap between sex\nand reproduction increases. Hrdy (1986), focusing on primatology,\npoints out that once the notion of female promiscuity and the idea that\nthere can be more reasons for mating than simply gathering sperm from\none high quality male, were considered, several new hypotheses\nregarding the benefits of female promiscuity emerged. Some of\nthese hypotheses are still linked to reproduction, although the picture\nis more complicated than issues of female choice and male\ncompetition. For example, the diverse paternity hypothesis\npredicts that in unpredictable and changing environments a\nfemale's lifetime reproductive success can be improved by\nproducing offspring with different fathers. Other hypotheses are\nnot directly related to reproduction. Examples include the\nhypothesis that multiple matings and orgasms are physiologically\nbeneficial to females and the hypothesis that females have sex with\nsubordinate males to stop these males from leaving the social\ngroup. Hrdy writes that \u201call but one of these\nhypotheses\u2026were arrived at by considering the world from a\nfemale's point of view\u201d (127). She points\nout that when this change in perspective was happening, primarily in\nthe 1970's, there was an increase in the proportion of women\nprimatologists and that these women were paying attention to female\nprimates. She doubts that it is just chance that led women\nscientists to look at female behaviors, writing in 1986 that \u201cit\nis disconcerting to note that primatologists are beginning to find\npolitically motivated females and nurturing males at roughly the same\ntime that a woman runs for vice president of the United States and Garry\nTrudeau starts to poke fun at \u2018caring males\u2019 in his\ncartoons (137).\u201d\n\n\nMore recent research on sexual selection has embraced a wider range\nof perspectives. In particular there is a growing body of\nfeminist research on topics such as male mate choice, female-female\ncompetition, and the active female role in evolutionary reproductive\nconflicts between the sexes (see Hrdy 1999 and Gowaty 1992, 1997,\n2004). Joan Roughgarden offers an alternative to sexual\nselection, social selection theory, that focuses on the direct\necological benefits of social behavior, including animal mating\nbehavior (2004, 2009). These ecological benefits refer to the\nways that social interactions can improve the number of offspring that\nan individual can raise. This theory can account for the\nempirical evidence that has been used to support sexual\nselection. It does not treat same sex sexuality as anomalous\nbecause these social interactions can provide ecological benefits that\nsupport reproductive success. This theory is the subject of\nlively debate. Sexual selection theory is an active field of research,\nin which there is lots of opportunity for further feminist\nanalyses.\n",
