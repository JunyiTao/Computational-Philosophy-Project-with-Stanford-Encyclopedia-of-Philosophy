    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods in General || Personal Relationships: Reasons, Duties and Goods\n2.3 Personal Relationships: Reasons, Duties and Goods\n\nThe interest in how personal relationships and the goods they produce\ngenerate reasons has given rise to a large and growing body of\nliterature outside the ethics of care (Scheffler 2001; Kolodny 2003;\nKeller 2013; Seglow 2013). Our reasons to be partial towards our close\nassociates often take the form of prima facie duties. Unlike\nsome of the care ethicists (Noddings 2002), its authors do not assume\nthat (close) personal relationships are the paradigm of the rest of\nmorality. Rather, they start from the observation that people have\nspecial permissions towards, and owe special duties to, those with\nwhom they are in personal relationships, such as friends, spouses, or\nfamily members. Often such duties are called associative duties.\n(Although it is also possible that the reasons generated by personal\nrelationships are not moral reasons, in which case they do not\ngenerate moral duties; for an argument why not all good reasons are\nmoral reasons see Susan Wolf 1992).\n\nThere is a debate over whether or not all associative duties can be\nreduced to impartial duties. One plausible interpretation is that we\nall have a general duty to protect the vulnerable and those with whom\nwe stand in personal relationships are unusually vulnerable to us; and\nwe have powerful consequentialist reasons to welcome the formation of\npersonal relationships\u2014and hence the generation of associative\nduties\u2014in order to solve coordination problems (Goodin 1985). A\ncommon complaint about reductionist, or impartial, theories is that\nthey are self-effacing (Keller 2013; Collins 2013): it seems\nappropriate for the agent who is subject to the duty to be motivated\nby their attitude towards the individual to whom the duty is owed, or\nmaybe by the value of the relationship, rather than by impartial\nconsiderations.\n\nAssuming associative duties are indeed irreducible to impartial\nduties, what is their ground? Most prominent families of accounts\npoint to personal projects, to the value the relationship or the value\nof the person to whom the duty is being owed (for a recent critical\ndiscussion see Keller 2013). On the first kind of view, agents\u2019\nground projects\u2014that is, fundamental commitments that are\nclosely connected to their practical identity\u2014give rise to\nreasons (Williams 1981), and possibly duties, and some personal\nrelationships are amongst these projects. According to another view,\nprojects are not morally appropriate grounds for associative duties;\nrather, associative reasons respond to the value of the person with\nwhom one has a personal relationship (Keller 2013). But strangers have\nthe same moral value as our associates; this account will struggle to\nexplain why we only have reasons of partiality towards those with whom\nwe are in relationships. Finally, perhaps the most widespread family\nof views justifies associative duties as grounded in the\nnon-instrumental value of relationships (Scheffler 2001; Seglow 2013),\nor in their final value (Kolodny 2003), or in their moral goodness\n(Jeske 2008). According to some philosophers, moreover, the value of\nsome personal relationships is partly constituted by parties living up\nto their associative duties (Raz 1989; Brighouse & Swift 2014).\nOne version of this view, that is particularly interesting for this\nentry, is Jonathan Seglow\u2019s appeal to relationship goods in\norder to justify associative duties (Seglow 2013). Seglow argues that\nthe most plausible way of interpreting the claim that relationships\ngenerate duties on account of their value is to see how the\nrelationships contribute to the flourishing of the people involved.\nAnd this, in turn, is best understood in terms of the goods uniquely\nmade possible by relationships such as friendships, parent-child\nrelationships and membership in various associations. According to\nSeglow, personal relationship goods are distinctive to these\nrelationships: for instance parents and children owe each other love,\nco-citizens owe each other respect, etc.\n\nNote that there is also logical space for the possibility that\nsome associative duties exist independently from the value of\nthe relationship, for pragmatic reasons, while others, which some have\ncalled pure associative duties, exist in virtue of the\nnon-instrumental value of the relationship (Macleod 2010a).\n\nThe existence and weight of personal relationship goods is widely\nacknowledged irrespective of one\u2019s position on these debates,\nnamely whether one thinks that (a) personal relationships generate\nassociative duties or merely (non-moral) reasons, (b) associative\nduties are reducible to impartial duties or not and (c) associative\nreasons are grounded in personal projects, the value of individuals to\nwhom the duty is being owed, or the value of the relationship.\nObviously, some goods that are crucial for most people\u2019s\nwellbeing can only exist due to human beings\u2019 relational nature:\nfriendship, love, emotional care, attention, affection, company\netc.\n\nPersonal relationship goods are not always easy to individuate. This\nis illustrated in debates about one particular personal relationship,\nand the good that it generates, namely love\u2014a topic that has\nreceived much recent philosophical interest. Love is a form of valuing\nanother individual, whether as an appropriate response to her value\n(Velleman 1999) or by bestowing value on her through the relationship\nwith the beloved (Frankfurt 2004), perhaps by creating a common\nhistory between the individuals in the relationship (Kolodny 2003,\n2010). In either case, love has been said to depend on, or even be\nconstituted by, other personal relationship goods. On David\nVelleman\u2019s (1999) account, according to which love is an\nappraisal of value, an ability to pay special attention to some\nindividuals to whom one is willing to become vulnerable is what makes\npossible love for particular individuals. Others, too, think that\nloving consists in directing one\u2019s attention in order to attend\nto the valuable features of the beloved (Jollimore 2011) and some of\nVelleman\u2019s philosophical predecessors, such as Iris Murdoch,\nbelieved that attention is the very essence of love and claimed that\n\u201cLove is the extremely difficult realization that something\nother than oneself is real\u201d (Murdoch 1959: 51). On this view,\nlove seems to respond to a need to be seen by others, to be known as\none really is rather than be a mere pretext for other\nindividuals\u2019 projections. An alternative view identifies love as\na form of robust concern, or care, for the beloved, for her own sake\n(Soble 1990; LaFollette 1996; Frankfurt 1999).\n\nThe existence of personal relationship goods and of the reasons that\nflow from personal associations create several moral problems: One is\nto explain why it is justified to display partiality towards some\nindividuals, given the standard assumption that morality requires us\nto treat people impartially. The various accounts of associative\nreasons/duties outlined at the beginning of this section grapple with\nthis problem.\n\nA second problem is that it seems morally objectionable, and possibly\nwrong, that people do not benefit equally from personal relationships\nand the goods they generate. Some people are lonely, out of no choice\nor fault of their own; and those who do enjoy (good) personal\nrelationships have partners who can be very unequally resourceful\nand/or invested in the relationship. This is a distributive objection\n(Scheffler 2001), and it obtains independently from the truth about\nthe existence and nature of associative duties. However, if we do have\nassociative duties towards our near and dear, rather than mere reasons\nto bestow personal relationship goods onto them, the inequalities and\nunfairness are even more evident. Personal relationship goods have\nboth instrumental and non-instrumental value (the next section unpacks\nthese different kinds of value and the way it bears on matters of\njustice). To illustrate, love is non-instrumentally valuable to the\nbeloved, and it also allows the beloved to enjoy other desirable\nthings\u2014such as pleasure, or the advantages of having someone who\nknows her well and who is motivated to serve her interests. Therefore,\nthe enjoyment of functional loving relationships makes one better off.\nFurther, some of the benefits that loving relationships bestow on the\nbeloved can have a positional aspect\u2014that is, they give the\nbeloved a competitive edge over others when it comes to opportunities\nfor goods that are external to the relationship. For instance, the\nformal and informal education that loving and resourceful parents give\nto their children do not merely make these children better off than\nthey would otherwise be; but, because they place them in more\nadvantageous positions in the competition for the social goods, they\nrender children who do not benefit from loving and/or resourceful\nparents worse off (Brighouse & Swift 2006).\n\nThe distributive objection provides support to the belief that there\nare moral duties to try and associate with those who don\u2019t yet\nbenefit from close relationships in order to give them an opportunity\nto enjoy various personal relationship goods (Collins 2013) or to\ncreate the social conditions in people are likely to form valuable\nrelationships (as surveyed in\n section 6).\n",
