    "main_text": "Applications of temporal logics || Temporal logics in Artificial Intelligence\n11.2 Temporal logics in Artificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the major areas of application\nof temporal logics. Relating temporal reasoning to AI was suggested\nalready in the early philosophical discussion on AI by McCarthy and\nHayes (1969), the theory of processes and events in Rescher and\nUrquhart (1971, Chapter XIV), and the period-based theories of Hamblin\n(1972); see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (1995) for an overview of\nthese early developments. In the 1980s, temporal representation and\nreasoning gradually became an increasingly prominent theme in AI with\nseveral influential works, including McDermott\u2019s temporal logic\nfor reasoning about processes and plans (McDermott 1982);\nAllen\u2019s general theory of action and time (Allen 1984); the\nEvent Calculus of Kowalski and Sergot (1986); the reified temporal\nlogic by Shoham (1987); the logic of time representation by Ladkin\n(1987); and the work on temporal database management by Dean and\nMcDermott (1987). Galton (1987) provides a systematic account of these\nand other important developments in that period; see also Vila (1994)\nand Pani and Bhattacharjee (2001) for comprehensive reviews.\nInfluential works in the 1990s include the introduction of\ninterval-based temporal logics by Halpern and Shoham (1991) and by\nAllen and Ferguson (1994), with representation of actions and events;\nthe Situation Calculus of Pinto and Reiter (1995); and Lamport\u2019s\nAction Theory (Lamport 1994), etc. Further important developments\nrelating temporal reasoning and AI since then include: temporal\nreasoning in natural language, temporal ontologies, temporal databases\nand constraint solving, temporal planning, executable temporal logics,\nspatial-temporal reasoning, temporal reasoning in agent-based systems,\netc. The field has gradually grown so rich and broad \u2014 as\nwitnessed by the 20-chapter handbook edited by Fisher et al. (2005)\n\u2014 that it is impossible to even briefly survey it here, so we\nonly bookmark a few of the main issues of philosophical relevance that\nhave been in the focus of temporal reasoning and logics in AI.\n\nThe prevailing logical approach to temporal representation and\nreasoning in AI, especially in the 1980s-1990s, has traditionally been\nbased on temporalized variations of first-order logic rather than on\nPrior-style temporal logic. The approach is best illustrated by the\nso-called method of temporal arguments (McCarthy and Hayes\n1969; Shoham 1987; Vila 1994). According to this method, the temporal\ndimension is captured by augmenting propositions and predicates with\n\u2018time stamp\u2019 arguments, as for example \u201cPublish(A.\nPrior, Time and Modality, 1957)\u201d. An alternative, yet\nclosely related approach, is the one of reified temporal\nlogics (McDermott 1982; Allen 1984; Shoham 1987; see Ma and\nKnight 2001 for a survey). This approach makes use of reifying\nmeta-predicates, such as \u2018TRUE\u2019 and \u2018FALSE\u2019,\nbut also \u2018HOLDS\u2019, \u2018OCCURS\u2019,\n\u2018BEFORE\u2019, \u2018AFTER\u2019, interval relations such as\n\u2018MEETS\u2019, \u2018OVERLAPS\u2019, etc., which are applied\nto propositions of some standard logical language (e.g. classical\nfirst-order logic). An example of a reified expression is\n\u201cOCCUR(Born(A. Prior), 1914)\u201d. Associated with theories of\ntime are theories of temporal incidence (cf. Vila 2005).\nStill, the prominence of the modal logic based approach has always\nbeen strong, and it has more recently resurged, e.g. in the context of\nagent-based temporal reasoning (cf. Fisher and Wooldridge 2005).\nTheories of temporal reasoning in AI distinguish between\nfluents, which are propositions describing states of the\nworld that may change over time, and events, representing\nwhat happens in the world and causes changes between states.\nPhilosophical issues arising here concern the nature of fluents and\nevents, the meaning of instantaneous events, the distinction between\nhomogeneous states and inhomogeneous events, the dividing instant\nproblem, the frame problem, etc. For further discussion,\nsee Shoham (1987); Galton (1990); and Vila (2005). See also the\nrelated discussion on reasoning about action and change in Section 4\nof the entry on\n logic and artificial intelligence.\nBoth fluents and events can be considered in discrete or\ncontinuous time and they can be instantaneous or durational. This\nkeeps the debate on instant-based versus\ninterval-based formal models of time alive, with various\ntheories following and comparing both approaches, including van\nBenthem (1983); Allen (1983); Allen and Hayes (1989); Allen and\nFerguson (1994); Galton (1995); Vila (2005); etc. \n\n\nFor further reading and discussion on temporal reasoning and logics in\nAI, see Vila (1994); Galton (1995); the comprehensive handbook Fisher\net al. (2005); and the more concise handbook chapter Fisher\n(2008).\n",
