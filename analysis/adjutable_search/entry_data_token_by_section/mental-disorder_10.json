    "main_text": "The Disorder in Mental Disorder || Formal Definitions\n4.4 Formal Definitions\n\nEschewing a more formal definitions, analyses such as the\n\u201cdistress-impairment\u201d one introduced earlier rely on\nprototypical cases (see Graham 2013, for example), or point\nto intrinsic vagueness that must thwart such efforts (Keil, Keuck\n& Hauswald 2017). Others are more ambitious, proposing analytic\ndefinitions in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions and even\nencompassing other medical conditions as well as mental disorders.\n(For those stressing the inseparability and interdependence of mental\nand bodily disorder, no important distinction is acknowledged between\nmental and physical disorders [P\u00e2rvan 2015].) (i)\u2013(vi)\nbelow are a sample of these efforts. More recent definitions reflect\nincreasing recognition that the diversity of the category must\nfrustrate efforts at a covering definition.\n\nA disease is the absence of normal function of a mechanism or\nprocess in a person that detracts from the person\u2019s survival or\nreproduction (Boorse 1977). More recent elaborations on this\nearly version of the definition emphasize biological function and\nstatistical normality, so that on a bio-statistical theory,\ndiseases are internal states that depress a functional ability\nbelow species-typical levels (relative to age and sex) (Boorse\n1997). Critiques of this definition have challenged its aspiration to\nbe value free; its introduction of an arbitrarily selected reference\nclass; and its failure to honor the accepted distinction between\n\u201cdisease\u201d with its implied defectiveness, and mere\ndifference (Bolton 2008).\nA condition is a mental disorder if and only if (a) the\ncondition causes some harm or deprivation of benefit to the person as\njudged by the standards of the person\u2019s culture, and (b) the\ncondition results from the inability of some internal mechanism to\nperform its natural function, wherein a natural function is an effect\nthat is part of the evolutionary explanation of the existence and\nstructure of the mechanism (Wakefield 1992, 1997). Critiques of\nthis definition occur later in this section and in\n Section 5.\n In addition, definitions in evolutionary theoretic terms introduce a\ncategory of innate risk factors that is belied by the way natural,\nsocial, and individual factors are inextricably interwoven in disorder\n(Bolton 2008). And the formulation relies on unsubstantiated,\nempirical assumptions about the way natural selection underlies\nnatural function (Lilienfeld & Marino 1995; Murphy & Stich\n2000). The relativism in (a) above has been challenged (Gert &\nCulver 2004: 421; Bolton 2008). And rather than exhibiting\ndysfunction, at least some mental disorders may be explained\nrelationally, by traits that are mismatched in the\nperson\u2019s context, due to their developmental or evolutionary\nfeatures (Garson 2015).\nA mental malady is a condition of a person, other than his\nrational beliefs and desires, such that he is suffering, or at\nincreased risk of suffering, an evil (death, pain, disability, loss of\nfreedom or opportunity, or loss of pleasure), in the absence of a\ndistinct sustaining cause (Gert & Culver 2004). The concept\nof a sustaining cause is unacceptably vague and inclusive, permitting\nconditions to count as disorders that are not, intuitively, disorders\nat all (Murphy 2012). For example, some disorders leave permanent,\nnon-pathological alterations in the character that outlast any\nimmediate stressors.\nA condition is pathological if and only if it is an abnormal\nbodily/mental condition that requires medical intervention and that\nharms standard members of the species in standard conditions\n(Reznek 1987: 163\u20134). For criticisms of this definition\u2019s\nappeal to baseline population norms, and to medical intervention, see\ncomments on (i), (ii) and (iv) above. Reference to required medical\nintervention fails to acknowledge risks of over-medicalization and\nover-diagnosis and invokes concerns over enhancement. (See Savulescu,\nter Meulen, & Kahane 2011.)\nDiseases involve deprivation, but a disease is a depriving\nrelation rather than a depriving entity, depending on the patient for\nits existence\u2026the person is not conceived as ontologically\ndiminished or defective because it suffers the deprivation.\nDrawing on Augustine\u2019s ontology of disease, bodily integrity,\nand the human person, Alexandra P\u00e2rvan argues that disease\nstands in ontologically necessary connection with the patient as\nperson. (From this is derived a treatment approach based on how the\nperson relates to the disease, and a goal of reconfiguring the person\nas deprived but not diminished [P\u00e2rvan 2015, 2016].) This\naccount is limited inasmuch as it requires adherence to its\nAugustinian ontology.\nMental disorders are biological kinds whose effects lead to\nharmful consequences \u2026 more natural kinds of mental disorders\n(e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) are biological kinds primarily\nunderwritten by biological mechanisms. More artificial kinds (e.g.,\nhysteria, voyeuristic disorder) are social kinds primarily\nunderwritten by social mechanisms. (Tsou 2022:10).\n\u2026 at least some of the forms (of madness) \u2026 are\nstrategies for solving problems, coping with aspects of the\nenvironment, regulating one\u2019s mental economy \u2026 the\ncreative problem-solving activity of the human mind, or God\u2019s\nstern but benevolent hand, or the healing impetus of nature, or an\nevolutionary adaptation, a purpose-driven process, a well-operated\nmachine \u2026 (Garson 2022:10). If neuropsychiatry ever\nsucceeds in identifying the defective mechanisms it seeks,\nGarson\u2019s analysis must be weakened. Moreover, it seems\nvulnerable to some of the accusations of complexity-defying\noversimplification that have dogged other adaptationist just-so\nstories.\n\n",
