    "main_text": "The Argument for Cartesian Skepticism Employing the Closure Principle\n3. The Argument for Cartesian Skepticism Employing the Closure Principle\n\nMany contemporary philosophers take the canonical argument for\nCartesian Skepticism to involve skeptical hypotheses and a Closure\nPrinciple\n (CP).[5]\n A skeptical hypothesis (with respect to a proposition p and a\nsubject S) is a proposition SH such that if SH\nwere true, then: (a) S would not know p, and (b)\nS would not be able to distinguish SH from a situation\nwhere S knows p. The evil demon scenario that Descartes\nenvisions at the end of his \u201cFirst Meditation\u201d functions\nas a near-universal skeptical hypothesis, for the demon has the power\nto deceive any subject regarding almost any proposition. One way in\nwhich a SH may satisfy (a) is by describing a situation where\np is false, but this is not the only way. Descartes\u2019 evil\ndemon may induce in a disembodied subject\u2019s mind an experience\nas of the subject\u2019s own hands in front of her, as a result of\nwhich the subject believes that there are hands in front of her, while\nat the same time dangling some unattached hands in front of the\nsubject (we are waiving here difficulties having to do with how to\nlocate objects relative to disembodied subjects). The subject\u2019s\nbelief that there are hands in front of her is in that case true, but\nshe still doesn\u2019t know it. The connection between Closure\nprinciples and arguments for skepticism gets complicated if we\ncountenance skeptical hypotheses which do not entail the falsehood of\nthe proposition in question, and so in what follows we limit our\ndiscussion to those that do.\n\nLetting \u201ch\u201d stand for any proposition about the\nexternal world we would ordinarily take ourselves to be justified in\nbelieving, for example, G. E. Moore\u2019s famous \u201chere\u2019s\na hand\u201d (Moore 1939 [1993]), and re-using \u201cSH\u201d for a\nskeptical hypothesis relative to h (we leave the subject\ntacit), we can state the contemporary canonical CP-style argument\nfor Cartesian Skepticism as follows:\n\n\nCP1. If I am justified in believing that h, then I am\njustified in believing that \\({\\sim}\\textit{SH}\\).\nCP2. I am not justified in believing that\n\\({\\sim}\\textit{SH}\\).\nTherefore, I am not justified in believing that h.\n\n\n\nCP1 follows from the following Closure Principle (letting\n\u201cJx\u201d stand for the subject is justified in\nbelieving x):\n\n\nClosure Principle [CP]: For all\npropositions x and y, if x entails y, and\nJx, then Jy.\n\n\n(In the argument above, \\(x = h\\) and \\(y = {\\sim}SH\\).)\n\nA crucial feature of CP is that it does not depend upon employing a\nstringent notion of justification. Suppose that (positive)\njustification comes in degrees, where the lowest degree is something\nlike mere plausibility and the highest degree is absolute certainty.\nCP could be recast as follows:\n\n\nCP*: For all propositions, x and y, if\nx entails y, and Jx to degree u, then\nJy to degree v (where \\(u \\le v)\\).\n\n\nThere appear to be only three ways that one can respond to the\nCP-style skeptical argument: deny at least one premise, deny that the\nargument is valid, or reluctantly accept the conclusion\u2014if\nneither of the first two alternatives succeeds.\n",
