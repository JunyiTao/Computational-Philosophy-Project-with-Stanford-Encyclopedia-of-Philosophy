    "main_text": "Ontology: What Are Models? || Set-theoretic structures\n2.3 Set-theoretic structures\n\nAn influential point of view takes models to be set-theoretic\nstructures. This position can be traced back to Suppes (1960) and is\nnow, with slight variants, held by most proponents of the so-called\nsemantic view of theories (for a discussion of this view, see the\nentry on\n the structure of scientific theories).\n There are differences between the versions of the semantic view, but\nwith the exception of Giere (1988) all versions agree that models are\nstructures of one sort or another (Da Costa and French 2000).\n\nThis view of models has been criticized on various grounds. One\npervasive criticism is that many types of models that play an\nimportant role in science are not structures and cannot be\naccommodated within the structuralist view of models, which can\nneither account for how these models are constructed nor for how they\nwork in the context of investigation (Cartwright 1999; Downes 1992;\nMorrison 1999). Examples for such models are interpretative models and\nmediating models, discussed later in\n Section 4.2.\n Another charge held against the set-theoretic approach is that\nset-theoretic structures by themselves cannot be representational\nmodels\u2014at least if that requires them to share some structure\nwith the target\u2014because the ascription of a structure to a\ntarget system which forms part of the physical world relies on a\nsubstantive (non-structural) description of the target, which goes\nbeyond what the structuralist approach can afford (Nguyen and Frigg\nforthcoming).\n",
