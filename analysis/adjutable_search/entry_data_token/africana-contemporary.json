Framing themes: circumscribing the topic\n\nEarly in his masterful Introduction to Africana Philosophy,\nLewis R. Gordon defines his subject in a deceptively simple way that\nboth anticipates important complexities and sets some basic\nboundaries. Africana philosophy, he says, is \u201cas an area of\nphilosophical research that addresses the problems faced and raised by\nthe African diaspora\u201d (Gordon 2008, 13). The references to\nproblems and to the diaspora immediately point to two vital framing\nthemes for the field.\n1.1 Africanaity\n\nThe first theme has to do with the threshold metaphysical and\nsocio-anthropological assumptions that underwrite the use of\n\u201cAfricana\u201d as a modifier. Things that earn this\nmodifier\u2014people and practices most clearly, institutions and\nmaterial objects somewhat less so\u2014are supposed to be\ninterestingly connected to the continent of Africa and, therefore, to\neach other. This raises obvious questions. What kind of connections\ncount for this purpose? How strong do they have to be?\n\nArguments about how to account for the unity of the Africana condition\ncomprise one of the recurring subjects of Africana philosophy. This\nhas often taken the form of debates about \u201cAfricanity,\u201d\nthe key contours of which have been helpfully chronicled by Souleymane\nBachir Diagne\n (2001).[1]\n Unfortunately, that concept is ambiguous between studies of African\ncommonalities\u2014of what, say, Ghanaians and Eritreans share that\nBritons of African descent may not\u2014and studies of African\ndiasporic continuities. In deference to the distinctiveness of the\nconcerns animating these studies and of the conclusions they often\nreach, I will reserve the notion of Africanity for studies focused on\nthe continent and introduce the notion of Africanaity to\nindicate an interest in wider diasporic connections.\n\nThis is not the place to consider in detail the threshold questions of\nAfricanaity. Luckily it is a fairly intuitive concept, rooted in\nwidely\u2014if often dimly\u2014understood facts about the social\nand political history of Africa and its peoples over the last several\ncenturies. One can debate the precise meaning of these facts or the\nlimits of the intuition underwriting the Africana idea. But the basic\nintuition, even for critics of its extended application in, say, a\nPan-African politics, is provisionally useful as what Lucius T. Outlaw\nJr. calls a \u201cgathering notion,\u201d used to capture the same\ninsight that underwrites locutions like \u201cof African\ndescent,\u201d and to prepare that insight for extension, critique,\nand elaboration (Outlaw 2004, 90).\n1.2 Problematicity\n\nThe notion of Africanaity draws out the part of Gordon\u2019s quick\ndefinition of Africana philosophy that focuses on the diaspora. But\nwhat about the rest? What does it mean to refer to the problems that\nthe diaspora faces and raises? And why dwell on these problems as a\nway of framing this study?\n\nAdditional language from Gordon may be helpful. He explains:\n\n\nSince there was no reason for the people of the African continent to\nhave considered themselves African until that identity was imposed\nupon them through conquest and colonization in the modern era \u2026\nthis area of thought also refers to the unique set of questions raised\nby the emergence of \u201cAfricans\u201d and their diaspora\u2026\n. Such concerns include the convergence of most Africans with the\nracial term \u201cblack\u201d and its many connotations. (Gordon\n2008, 1)\n\n\nGordon\u2019s point is that taking Africanaity seriously means asking\nabout the conditions under which the concept came to have something to\nrefer to. And to ask about these conditions is to explore a handful of\nsocial, methodological, and broadly philosophical problems, and to\nconsider certain oddly robust links between these problems and the\nAfricana condition.\n\nI\u2019ll refer to this constellation of problems and their\nconnection to the Africana condition as problematicity. This second\nframing theme sets three vital tasks for the field.\n\nFirst, it is important to grapple responsibly with the very real\nproblems that face Africa and its diaspora. There are many obvious\nexamples, from imperial incursions and forced migrations to asymmetric\nintegration into the world economy and authoritarian post-independence\ngovernance. Philosophical inquirers may take these conditions as their\nsubject matter, but they will also have to grapple with the way these\nconditions shape and constrain the prospects for intellectual\nwork.\n\nSecond, it is equally important, if not more so, to call out and\ncorrect for the tendency to assume that Africana communities\ndon\u2019t just face problems but are also somehow inherently prone\nto them. The thought here is that the condition of Africanaity is not\nsimply about facing problems, but also, in a way, about being\na problem. I\u2019ve borrowed this way of putting it from a germinal\nformulation by one of the canonical figures of Africana thought. Early\nin his career, W.E.B. Du Bois famously invited his readers to consider\na puzzling question on behalf of people racialized as Black: how\ndoes it feel to be a problem? (Du Bois \u201cOf Our Spiritual\nStrivings\u201d [1903] 1986, 363). That is (in part) to say: how does\nit feel to move through life as a living representative of a\nsociety\u2019s ethical lapses and epistemic incapacities, and to\ncontend with the social pressure to think of oneself as the source of\nthese problems? In light of the substantial overlap between\nAfricanaity and Blackness, the tendency \u201cto view Black people as\na problem people\u201d is very much at issue for Africa and its\ndiaspora (West 1999, 104).\n\nThe phenomenological depth of this second mode of problematicity\npoints to a third mode, which involves not simply facing or being a\nproblem, but also raising problems. We\u2019ve already seen\nthis at work to some degree, in the way the Africana idea prompts\nquestions in metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology. But Africanaity\nalso raises deeper problems of method and world-view and, in some\nsenses of the word, ontology. The discursive event that V. Y. Mudimbe\n(1988) dubs \u201cthe invention of Africa\u201d complicates or, one\nmight say, short-circuits certain standard modern modes of\nphilosophical comportment\u2014or, better put, forces philosophical\nEuro-modernity to misrepresent and perhaps misunderstand its actual\nanimating imperatives. This complication leads Hegel to extrude Africa\nfrom his staging of world history while doing considerable violence to\nactual history and to geography. It leads figures like Thomas\nJefferson and John Locke to mirror the contradictions of modern\npolitical thought in their works and their lives. It leads Fanon (in\nanother germinal contribution to Africana thought) to note that reason\nwalks out of the room when he walks in. Thoughts like these have\ninspired Gordon (2000) and others to organize a great deal of fruitful\nphilosophical work around the epistemological challenges of\n\u201cshifting the geography of reason\u201d and of bringing the\nhuman sciences to bear on populations whose members are often only\ntenuously regarded as\n human.[2]\n\n(To be clear: the claim here is not that African-descended people and\ncultures are somehow problematic by nature. Sober reflection\non the empirical evidence and on plausible meanings of \u201cby\nnature\u201d cannot sustain that thought. The claim is that a)\nEuro-modernity was in some ways built on the conviction that\nAfrican-descended people are inherently problematic, and that b)\nphilosophical interventions that resist this conviction become\nproblems, render themselves problematic, for hegemonic approaches to\nphilosophy.)\n\nThe point of starting with these framing themes is to mark certain\nvital contexts for Africana philosophical reflection. To study\nAfricana philosophy is, first of all, to do the things one does in\nother areas of philosophy: consider a range of characteristic\nquestions and problems, study a cohort of canonical figures and texts,\nparticipate in living debates organized around familiar tropes and\nmoves, and so on. But it is also to do these things in contexts\ndefined by foundational questions\u2014about, for example, the nature\nof philosophical inquiry, the structure and impact of concrete\nmechanisms for knowledge production, and even the humanity of the\ninquirers\u2014to a degree that is fairly unusual. As an emblem of\nthis, consider that the establishment of African philosophy as a\nrespectable subject of study\u2014in a sense of\n\u201crespectable\u201d to be fleshed out below\u2014began with\ndebates over a single, simple, now-obsolete question: can Africans\neven do philosophy?\n\nHaving worked through the themes that emerged from Gordon\u2019s\ndeceptively simple definition of Africana philosophy, we are now in a\nbetter position to receive a similar but more elaborate definition.\nOutlaw describes \u201cAfricana philosophy\u201d as \u201ca\nthird-order, metaphilosophical, umbrella-concept\u2026 . [T]he name\ndoes not refer to a particular philosophy, philosophical system,\nmethod, or tradition\u201d (Outlaw 2017, \u00a71, par. 1). It refers\ninstead to a field of study that emerges from the distinctive\nconditions that produce and implicate Africa and its diaspora, that\ntakes seriously the experiences and reflections of the peoples who are\nmost directly affected and implicated by those conditions, and that,\nas a result of the first two factors, tends to feature certain\nrecurring preoccupations or themes. Some of those preoccupations and\nthemes appear above, and will receive more attention, alongside\nseveral additional themes, in the sections to come.\n\n(Outlaw also identifies a number of \u201ckey heuristic\npresumptions\u201d that can help to ward off easy misconceptions\n[Outlaw 2017, \u00a71, par. 2]. The most important of these\npresumptions are that a) there are responsible ways to account for the\nunity and distinctiveness of the phenomena that bear the predicate\n\u201cAfricana\u201d; b) these accounts do not presuppose uniformity\nand homogeneity among Africana peoples and cultures, and they need not\naspire to or prescribe such uniformity; and c) \u201ccontributors [to\nAfricana philosophy] need not be persons African or of African\ndescent\u201d (Outlaw 2017, \u00a71, par. 5). As noted above, this\nentry will not delve any further into these presumptions. Readers\nseeking reassurance about these issues may consult the foundational\ntexts that Outlaw (2017) and Gordon (2008) explore in their overviews\nof the field.)\n2. Framing conditions: coloniality, heterodoxy, and historicity\n\nStudies of Africana philosophy and its subfields routinely begin by\nacknowledging that these became recognized areas of professional\nscholarly study only recently. These acknowledgments implicate three\nframing conditions that are crucial for understanding the field.\n\nThe first condition has to do with a version of what Elena Ru\u00edz\ncalls \u201cepistemic imperialism.\u201d This is her name for states\nof affairs in which hegemonic modes of epistemic practice\n\u201creproduce interpretive conditions favorable to the dominant\nassumptions.\u201d Philosophical activity under these conditions\n\u201ccreates and maintains interpretive spaces in philosophy that\nare self-confirming rather than culturally open and plural,\u201d and\nalso \u201cclears the way for the devaluation of non-dominant\nintellectual traditions through tacit methodological\nassumptions\u201d (Ru\u00edz 2018, 52\u201353). What this means is\nthat oppressive conditions exclude their victims from knowledge\nproduction not simply by preventing people with certain bodies,\nbackgrounds, beliefs, or other distinguishing features from entering\nthe institutions charged with knowledge work, but also by engineering\nthe conceptual and theoretical tools to promote epistemic numbness and\nturn exclusion into erasure.\n\nIssues of epistemic imperialism bear on Africana philosophy because\nhegemonic institutions have historically recognized, and to a\nconsiderable degree still recognize, philosophic interventions as\nachieving scholarly respectability by appeal to standards calibrated\nto colonial and apartheid imperatives. One very short version of this\nstory is that the most influential university systems in the\ncontemporary world\u2014including in Africa and the\nCaribbean\u2014started as the creations and tools of European\ncolonial powers or settler colonial authorities. (This is only one\nversion of the story because it is not, of course, a story simply\nabout university systems. It is also a story about, among other\nthings, publishing houses, dictionaries, the word\n\u201cphilosophy,\u201d and the baggage that European elite cultures\nattached to all of these things. Outlaw and Gordon also tell this\nstory well.) Consequently, and not surprisingly, it was only in the\nyears after colonized peoples won formal independence and apartheid\nregimes formally embraced democracy that these institutions began in\nany thoroughgoing way to credit research programs and curricular\ninitiatives not animated by assumptions about African backwardness,\nsavagery, or barbarism.\n\nThe fact that it took many, many years for hegemonic Euro-modern\ninquirers to begin to disentangle epistemic norms from colonial and\napartheid imperatives highlights the second contextual consideration,\ncall this \u201cthe condition of heterodoxy.\u201d Much of the work\nthat sets the agenda for Africana philosophy was produced largely\noutside of the forums that elite European-influenced intellectual\ncultures considered respectable. In some cases, this meant that\nAfrican-descended scholars worked in alternative, often racially\nsegregated, institutions and shared their research in alternative\nspaces. In other cases, it meant that these scholars worked on the\nmargins of mainstream institutions, enjoying or enduring highly\nconstrained interactions with the people who under different\ncircumstances would have been their colleagues and interlocutors. In\nthe vast majority of cases, it meant that people in African and\nAfrican-descended communities refined and employed their own\nmechanisms for producing knowledge. In all of these cases, it meant\nthat Africana intellectual work was importantly heretical or\nheterodox.\n\nAfricana philosophy\u2019s relatively recent arrival on the scene of\n\u201crespectable\u201d knowledge production points to the third\nframing condition for the field, its manifest historicity. The\nfield\u2019s unavoidable status as an artifact of evolving\nsociopolitical conditions puts historical dynamics at issue here in a\nway that other fields (outside of the history of philosophy) can\nusually evade. Because of this, a study of contemporary activity must\nbegin by attending to the development of the field over time, on at\nleast three levels. It is important to attend to the development of\ncertain ideas and to the canonization of certain texts and figures, to\nconsider the evolving social and institutional conditions under which\nAfricana philosophers did their work, and to credit the degree to\nwhich reconsiderations of the history constitute a thriving area of\ncontemporary study.\n3. History in contemporary perspective: guiding principles\n\nIntellectual and institutional histories are unusually central to\nAfricana philosophy, and are intertwined to an unusual degree, but\nthis is not the place to explore the institutional histories in\ndetail. The next section will provide a contemporary intellectual\nhistory, in order to establish the structural elements and thematic\npreoccupations that organize a great deal of the contemporary work\nwe\u2019ll soon consider. Still, it is important to organize the\ndiscussion in a way that makes room for responsible institutional\nhistories and accommodates their insights.\n\nAccordingly, three principles will guide the discussion to come.\nFirst, this study will focus on Africana philosophy as a\nfield. This means that the contributions of individual\nthinkers, however provocative or insightful, will be relevant here\nlargely insofar as they bear on the networks of intellectual exchange\nand institutional credentialing that invite description with terms\nlike \u201cdiscipline\u201d and \u201ctradition.\u201d It also\nmeans observing a distinction between the history of Africana\nphilosophy as an enterprise and the history of African-descended\nphilosophers as a cohort. Many members of this cohort have of course\nmade valuable, germinal contributions to the field, beginning with\ntowering figures like Alexander Crummell, whose establishment of the\nAmerican Negro Academy was an early exercise in building these\nnetworks. But many others, as Stephen C. Ferguson II points out,\n\u201cneed not (and have not) exclusively engaged the Africana\nexperience as an area of inquiry\u201d (Ferguson 2009, 23). The\nformer will be part of the story told here; the latter will not.\n\nSecond, this study will focus, to some degree, on\nprofessional academic work. Philosophical activity outside of\nthe academy\u2014in other institutional spaces or prior to the\nemergence of contemporary universities and their professional\nscholars\u2014will not be peremptorily excluded here, but will be\nrelevant insofar as it bears on the work that happens or might happen\nin or near the academy. The academy is of course not the only site for\nresponsible attempts at knowledge production, but it is a mechanism\nfor systematically enshrining certain of these attempts as resources\nfor more work. That is the aspect of Africana philosophy that I mean\nto take up here.\n\nThird, the discussion will approach the field as a\nparadisciplinary formation, which is to say that it will\nfocus on work that happens or might happen in and near philosophy\ndepartments. In speaking here of proximity to philosophy departments,\nI mean principally to capture two overlapping categories of thinkers:\nscholars who take up recognizably philosophical themes or resources\nin, say, departments of English or political science; and historical\nfigures without the sort of departmental affiliation that registers\nfor scholars now, but who make the kinds of moves and noises that\nencourage philosophers to invite them into their narratives of the\nfield. Which is to say: if philosophy of social science can have\nClifford Geertz and philosophy writ large can have Hume, Kierkegaard,\nEmerson, and Jane Addams, then Africana philosophy can have Patricia\nHill Collins and Alexander Crummell (both of whom will return\nbelow).\n\nIt is important to remain in the orbit of the academic discipline of\nphilosophy for at least three reasons: to preserve space for\nreflection on the distinctly philosophical questions that Africanaity\nputs in play, to cultivate distinctly philosophical resources for\ntreating those questions, and to credit the contributions and career\ntrajectories of the few African-descended philosophers who did their\nwork before the field established itself as a going concern. At the\nsame time, though, focusing just on work by card-carrying philosophers\nwould be unduly restrictive. For one thing, the discipline and the\nprofession have long been hostile both to sustained reflection on the\nissues that define the field and, in quite concrete ways, to the\nhumans who attempted to undertake this reflection. As a result, much\nof this reflection has happened and continues to happen in other\nplaces\u2014in political theory, sociology, literary theory, artistic\npractice, and more. In addition, and as a related matter, Africana\nphilosophy has in practice long been remarkably ecumenical, as the\ncontributor lists for key reference works makes clear. Excluding the\npolitical theorists, sociologists, Black studies scholars, and others\nwho have worked, often in conversation with professional philosophers,\nto advance the field would not only needlessly limit the available\nresources but would also run counter to ongoing practice.\n\nWith these guiding principles in place, and in deference to the\nframing conditions of historicity, coloniality, and heterodoxy, the\nnext section will present a swift history of Africana philosophy.\nConstructing historical narratives is always, to some degree, a\npresentist exercise: it is an attempt to read the past while guided by\ncontemporary concerns and informed by contemporary resources. This\nreading will lean into that aspect of the exercise\u2014it is, in\neffect, a reading of the history as seen in contemporary perspective,\nand is therefore also a way of wading a bit further into the\ncontemporary preoccupations that are the subject of this entry.\n\nThis presentist orientation recommends sorting the history into two\nbroad stages. The first is a long pre-history of the\nparadisciplinary formation under scrutiny here, a period, prior to the\nestablishment of the field in hegemonic epistemic communities, during\nwhich many key themes, issues, texts, and figures emerged. The second\nis a shorter, more recent stage, itself composed of three shorter\nperiods, during which the field established itself, achieved\nconsolidation, and moved into the contemporary moment.\n4. Stage one: emergence\n\nLike other areas of philosophical study, Africana philosophy emerged\nand matured as its practitioners identified and continued to explore a\nset of core elements. Of the texts, figures, debates, movements,\nschools, and themes that have come to organize conversations in and\ncontributions to the field, many came into focus during the first\nstage of Africana philosophy\u2019s history. Some had long careers\noutside the academy as resources for political mobilization,\nexistential sustenance, aesthetic experience, and critical\nedification, while others were the product of explicitly scholarly\nreflection. (And some were both.) Whatever their origin, many of these\nearly heterodox elements have made or are making their way into an\nacademic world that long wanted little to do with them, and they\ncontinue to set the agenda for contemporary work.\n\nPrecisely locating the start of this early period once more raises\npotentially knotty metaphysical and empirical puzzles. Before the idea\nof Africa as a unitary entity gained sufficient traction (precisely\nwhen this happened is the empirical puzzle), nothing interestingly\nidentifiable as African or Africana philosophy existed. There was a\ngreat deal of philosophizing in the place that would come to be called\nAfrica, and there may be reasons to link those early activities to the\nself-consciously African-oriented reflections that would emerge later.\nBut Gordon is surely right to say that reading ancient Egypt or Kush\nas what some scholars call a classical African civilization\n\u201cmust \u2026 be a modern imposition onto the past\u201d\n(Gordon 2008, 15). He is also right to point out that we typically\nallow this imposition, often without comment, in other\ncontexts\u2014in studies of Asian philosophy, for example, or in\nassuming the organic coherence of western philosophy from Greece to,\nsay Germany.\n\nOrigin puzzles aside, the long run-up to Africana philosophy\u2019s\narrival as a professional paradisciplinary formation yielded a number\nof themes that figure prominently in accounts of the field. Section\n4.1 will introduce some of these characteristic themes, while Section\n4.2 will consider the question of thematic unity across regions,\nintroducing some of the core thinkers along the way.\n4.1 Characteristic themes\n\nAfter noting the framing themes of (1) Africanaity and (2)\nproblematicity, as discussed above, we might follow Gordon (2008) and\nOutlaw (2017) in noting additional preoccupations like the\nfollowing:\n\nPhilosophical anthropology (because the question of the human of\ncourse looms large for people whose assumed status as subhuman is one\nof the foundation stones of European modernity)\nLiberation (for obvious reasons, beginning with the ethical and\nexistential burdens of living in oppressive circumstances and of\nfinding the balance between justifiable resistance and unethical\noverreach)\nMeta-reflections on reason (because the meaning of reason looms\nlarge for people typically assumed to be emotive, sensual,\nnon-rational brutes, people whose life chances were constrained by,\namong other things, powerful forms of what we now call epistemic\ninjustice)\nIdentity and self-consciousness (because epistemic injustice often\nhampers the pursuit of self-knowledge, and raises the ethical and\nexistential stakes of responsibly constructing the self)\nTheoretical archaeology (this is Dotson\u2019s (2017) term for,\nas Outlaw puts it (2004), the recovery of underappreciated\ncontributions by African-descended individuals and cultures)\n\n\nThese themes are not at all the exclusive preserve of Africana\nthinkers. The key to Africana thought is the way these themes converge\non and grow out of the condition of Africanaity, which is bound up\nwith distinctive modes of racialization and rooted in a particular\nuniverse of overlapping but distinct histories, geographies, and\ncultural practices.\n\nAfricana philosophy of course puts many more themes in play than these\nfew. But extending the list and reducing the space available for\nexplaining what the list means is at this point less useful than\nconsidering what it means for this enterprise to be rooted in\noverlapping sociohistorical contexts. This requires shifting from a\nstudy of unifying themes to a reflection on the centrifugal forces\nthat pull Africana philosophers in the direction of distinctive\nregional and methodological preoccupations.\n\nBefore moving on to these narrower considerations of region and\nmethod, though, a final overarching theme requires mention. Adeshina\nAfolayan and Toyin Falola conclude their introduction to the excellent\nPalgrave Handbook of African Philosophy by identifying a\nnewly pressing need that informs their editorial approach. African\nphilosophers have, they say, long focused on consolidating their\nprofessional standing and navigating intramural scholarly debates.\nHowever understandable that was, it is time, Afolayan and Falola\nsuggest, for \u201cAfrican philosophy to get on the street and get\ntheir theories dirtied by the predicament on the continent\u201d\n(Afolayan and Falola 2017, 12). In other words, African philosophy\nshould embrace its status as what Outlaw (2017), following Leonard\nHarris (following Frederick Douglass), calls a \u201cphilosophy born\nof struggle.\u201d This is clearly one of the overriding themes for\nAfricana philosophy as a whole, and should be added to the list.\n\nPhilosophy born of struggle (because philosophical reflection is\nnot a leisure exercise devoted to unwinding abstract puzzles, or it is\nnot just or always or most crucially that. It is (among other things)\na practice of bringing philosophical impulses and resources to bear on\ncertain pressing problems of life, and of exercising philosophical\nimpulses unrelated to those problems\u2014impulses related instead,\nsay, to beauty, or to the theory of knowledge\u2014despite the\nburdens of frequently problematic situations)\n\n4.2 Regional continuities and discontinuities\n\nScholars routinely distinguish three broad regional approaches to\nAfricana philosophy, one for the continent of Africa and two for the\nregions where the vast majority of participants in the diaspora\nreside: the Caribbean and the Americas. These regions are not just\ngeographically distinct but also have importantly different histories\nand constellations of cultures, not least because of the internal\ncomplexities that complicate region-wide generalizations. In addition,\nthese different regions occupy different places in global networks for\nmainstream knowledge production, which gives them different, and\ndifferently weighted, opportunities for publishing and scholarly\nexchange. In light of these conditions, it is not surprising that the\noccupants of each region often find themselves taking up distinctive\nquestions and problems, and pursuing them using modes of philosophical\nreflection and generic touchstones\u2014specific texts and\nfigures\u2014that are to some degree regionally specific.\n\nRegional specificity notwithstanding, the condition of Africanaity\nmeans in part that important thematic continuities stretch across the\nregions. Some concern the role of violence in anti-racist struggle,\nthe meaning of African roots for people in the diaspora, and the\ntensions between race-based, class-based, and gender-based approaches\nto social justice that call forth talk of intersectionality and\nrelated concepts. Others are importantly rooted in the overarching\nthemes noted above, with special emphasis on decolonization,\nanti-slavery agitation, and anti-imperial struggle.\n\nDespite these continuities, concerns that distinguish the regions are\nnot far to seek. For example, Gordon (2008) reasonably suggests that\nthe question of the modern might be one of Africana philosophy\u2019s\nunifying themes. But each region tends to adopt its own approach.\nAfrican thinkers often explore the relationship between modernity and\ntradition, sometimes linking the prospects for liberation to the\nprospects for modernizing Africa, while at other times complicating\nthe easy distinction between the traditional and the modern and the\neasy conflation of modernization with civilization and of both with\nEurope. Afro-Caribbean thinkers, by contrast, tend to be less\ninterested in a distant \u201ctraditional\u201d world than in the\nworld that resulted from the collision of forced migrants, indigenous\npeoples, and settler colonists. This approach eventuates in, among\nmuch else, Edouard Glissant\u2019s (1989) studies of\ncreolit\u00e9. In the Americas, finally, different\ndemographic conditions and historical trajectories led many (but of\ncourse not all) prominent figures to turn the question of tradition\ninto debates about racial uplift and racial integration.\n4.3 Complications\n\nThe period of emergence set the stage for contemporary work in\nAfricana philosophy by establishing many of the key elements that\nwould come to define the field. Careful study of the period, however,\nreveals some important challenges that continue to confront\ncontemporary work.\n\nOne important complication is the overlay of bias that constrains\nstandard notions of what counts as an intellectual contribution and of\nwho counts as a contributor. The standard notions tend to focus on the\nwritten output of elite men, even in studies of populations, cultures,\nand societies that are not at the top of the relevant social\nhierarchies. Considering the reasons for these biases is beyond the\nscope of this piece, though we can say that some reasons are better\nthan others. (To be sure, writerly output\u2014literature\u2014is\neasier to track and preserve than orature. But even the\nwritten contributions of women are routinely ignored or\nexcluded from the economies of writerly production.)\n\nSuffice it to say for now that one of the recurring challenges of\nAfricana thought in its philosophical modes has to do with crediting\nthe philosophical labor that goes into assembling a responsible life\nunder absurd conditions, when the laborers don\u2019t look or act\nlike standard-issue philosophers. For recent thinkers like Fred Moten\n(2017) in his study of artist Thornton Dial, this is sometimes a\nquestion about the philosophical significance of aesthetic\nproductions. For others, as we\u2019ll soon consider further, it is a\nquestion about the philosophical content of political activism or of\nvernacular cultures. It is almost always, of course, a question about\ncrediting the work of women and people without wealth, high incomes,\nhomes, and other markers of high socioeconomic status.\n\nA second important complication is rooted in a simple question: what\nhappens to local or national traditions if one focuses on broadly\nregional approaches to Africana philosophy? One way to ask this\nquestion is to focus on the differences between, say, Haiti and\nJamaica, and on the differences between Antenor Firmin and Marcus\nGarvey. Another way is to insist on the integrity and importance of\ndistinct national traditions of recognized and recognizably\nphilosophical activity, as Teodros Kiros (2004) and a number of\nscholars do in relation to figures like the 17th century\nEthiopian philosopher Zera Yacob.\n\nThere are two things to say about this possible tension between the\nregional or transnational and the local or national. First, it is\neminently possible for analyses at different scales to co-exist. The\nquestion is just whether there is sufficient warrant to sustain an\nanalysis at each level. One of the main aims of the early stages of\nprofessional Africana philosophy, as we\u2019ll soon see, was\nprecisely to show that there was a transnational enterprise related to\nAfricanaity that required\u2014and had long\nprovoked\u2014philosophical reflection. This in no way precludes more\nlocal studies. Second, one of the central claims of Africana\nphilosophy is that local contexts are often profoundly informed by\nbroader dynamics. Whether those dynamics matter in specific cases is a\nmatter to be settled by appeal to the details of the cases. One\nundeniable feature of the modern world is the way globe-spanning ideas\nabout things like race, reason, and civilization have shaped the life\nchances of large swathes of humanity for generations. This would seem\nto have some bearing on philosophical activity in African communities\nand communities in its diaspora.\n5. Stage two: establishment and consolidation\n\nThe first phase of Africana philosophy\u2019s emergence eventually\ngives way to a period of establishment and consolidation for the field\nas a field. During this time the themes and concerns from the earlier\nphilosophies born of struggle, inflected by regional concerns, make\ntheir way into the orbit of professional philosophy. Along the way,\nthey get translated into the distinctive vocabularies of the\ndiscipline\u2019s subfields and methodological schools, creatively\nexpanding those vocabularies in the process. (Or they acknowledge the\npossibility of this translation and resist or complicate it.)\n\nWe can say that the first phase ends and emergence gives way to\nestablishment when the field begins to get traction among teachers and\nresearchers in academic philosophy. Kwasi Wiredu explains in his\nclassic Companion to African Philosophy that this\ndidn\u2019t begin to happen in African universities until the middle\nto late sixties, as independence ushered in \u201csignificant numbers\nof post-independence African academics\u201d (Wiredu 2004, 2).\nSimilarly, Outlaw points out that the field has become more\nestablished as \u201csuccessive generations of persons of African\ndescent have entered the profession\u201d in the wake of anti-racist\nliberation struggles, and as these persons organized conferences and\nother mechanisms for networking and scholarly exchange, often across\nnational and regional boundaries (Outlaw 2017, \u00a710, par. 2).\n\nIf establishment begins with the arrival of Wiredu\u2019s and\nOutlaw\u2019s academics, it reaches its apex in the 1980s. This is\nthe point at which a number of germinal contributions make their way\ninto print. Think here of Richard A. Wright\u2019s African\nPhilosophy: An Introduction (1984), Cornel West\u2019s\nProphesy Deliverance! (1982), Angela Davis\u2019s Women,\nRace, and Class (1983), the first edition of Leonard\nHarris\u2019s Philosophy Born of Struggle (1983), V. Y.\nMudimbe\u2019s The Invention of Africa (1988), and Edouard\nGlissant\u2019s Caribbean Discourses (1989).\n\nThe 1990s and early 2000s were the years of consolidation. This is the\npoint at which a wave of more securely positioned scholarly\nprofessionals produced work destined for wider influence than the work\nof the previous era. Think here of Kwame Anthony Appiah\u2019s In\nMy Father\u2019s House (1993), Charles W. Mills\u2019s The\nRacial Contract (1997), Lucius T. Outlaw Jr.\u2019s On Race\nand Philosophy (1996), Lewis R. Gordon\u2019s Bad Faith and\nAntiblack Racism (1995), Paget Henry\u2019s Caliban\u2019s\nReason (2000), Kwame Gyekye\u2019s Tradition and\nModernity (1997), the first edition of Patricia Hill\nCollins\u2019s Black Feminist Thought (1990), and the\nrevised edition of Bernard R. Boxill\u2019s Blacks and Social\nJustice (1992).\n\nAs Africana philosophy becomes a professionally recognized field (as\nopposed to a vibrant but heterodox enterprise or tradition,\noverlapping only slightly with mainstream knowledge production), the\nwork begins, one might say, to riff on the discipline\u2019s accepted\nmovements and schools. Africana professional philosophers put\nmainstream professional resources into conversation with many of the\nconcerns and innovations that animated the earlier philosophies born\nof struggle. Far from simply applying sophisticated resources to\npre-philosophical raw material, this exercise at its best blends two\nmodes of philosophical reflection. One enjoys mainstream recognition,\nwhile the other benefits from testing and refinement by application in\nareas that its counterpart ignores; and each can, in principle,\ncompensate for shortcomings in the other. What results is work that\noften\u2014as Moten, following Robinson, says of Black radical\nMarxism\u2014involves both \u201cretention and disruption,\noriginality and response\u201d (Moten 2017,\n 9\u201310).[3]\n (It is also what one might say of the difference that Afro-diasporic\nmusical practices made in and to European traditions, producing new\nforms like samba and jazz along the way. Hence the appeal to\n\u201criffing.\u201d)\n\nUnderstanding this transformative, improvisational relationship is a\nprecondition to properly locating the contributions to the periods of\nemergence and consolidation. With this in mind one can acknowledge\nthat Davis and Outlaw both contribute to and draw from the tradition\nof critical theory, without diminishing either their originality or\ntheir traditional fluency. In similar ways, West and Harris riff on\nthe pragmatist tradition, Mudimbe and Glissant creatively appropriate\nand employ post-structuralist resources, Gordon and Henry, following\nWilliam R. Jones and\n others,[4]\n develop an Africana form of existential phenomenology, and Appiah and\nBoxill represent Africana thought in an analytic key.\n\nI\u2019ll somewhat arbitrarily nominate 2003\u20132004 as the cutoff\nbetween the period of consolidation and the contemporary moment. These\nyears saw the publication of Tommy L. Lott and John P. Pittman\u2019s\nCompanion to African-American Philosophy and Wiredu\u2019s\nCompanion to African Philosophy. I would say of both volumes\nsomething like what Afolayan and Falola say of the Wiredu volume: that\nthey constitute \u201ca significant nod to the appearance of\nAfrican[a] philosophy in \u2026 global academe\u201d (Afolayan and\nFalola 2017, 1).\n6. Reading the contemporary\u2014structure\n\nContemporary Africana philosophy builds on the periods of emergence,\nestablishment, and consolidation in four broad ways. Some thinkers\nwork to fortify and expand the field\u2019s store of germinal texts\nand figures. Others continue to improvise on the defining traits of\nthe mainstream schools and movements. Still others complicate and\nbroaden the map of regional preoccupations. And interventions of all\nthree types push new themes and debates, or new takes on older themes\nand debates, toward the center of the field. The first three will be\nthe subject of this section, while the fourth will be the subject of\nSection 7.\n6.1 Fortifying and expanding, tentpoles and theoretical archeology\n\nOne benefit of the long run-up to the contemporary moment in Africana\nphilosophy is that a tradition of thought has emerged with core\nfigures, texts, and questions. The tradition itself then becomes grist\nfor the mill of philosophical activity. Some of this activity goes to\nidentifying and shoring up (what some people think of as) the\nhistorical foundations of the field, while some goes to expanding the\nedifice that has been built atop those foundations.\n\nOne version of what I\u2019m referring to as fortification or shoring\nup is the outcome of a heightened focus on a few high-profile\nicons\u2014call this the \u201ctentpole approach.\u201d These are\nnotables like Cooper, Du Bois, and Fanon, the touchstone\nfigures\u2014Gordon refers to them as the pillars of African American\nphilosophy\u2014with the clearest prima facie cases for canonical\nstatus. As more philosophers examine the work of these figures and\nproduce more commentary on them and each other, subfields start to\ngrow up around them. This gives Africana philosophy that familiar\nsubdisciplinary shape, whereby anyone who knows anything about the\narea must have something to say about a handful of towering figures.\nOne clear and influential example of this sort of intervention is\nRobert Gooding-Williams\u2019s (2009) magisterial In the Shadow\nof Du Bois.\n\nThe tentpole approach is useful not just for fortification but also\nfor expansion. The expansionist version focuses on iconic figures that\nhave yet to receive the sort of attention from philosophers that\nthey\u2019ve received elsewhere. The aim here\u2014sometimes\nexplicitly undertaken as an exercise in Africana thought, sometimes\nsimply as an exercise in responsible scholarship\u2014is to give\nfigures like James Baldwin, Martin Luther King, Jr., Lorraine\nHansberry, and Audre Lorde the kind of attention that Gordon\u2019s\npillars have received. Tommie Shelby and Brandon M. Terry\u2019s\n(2018) volume on King and Imani Perry\u2019s (2018) study of\nHansberry exemplify this tendency.\n\nAn alternative to the tentpole approach, also with expansionist and\nfortificationist varieties, focuses less on iconic figures than on the\nbroader sweep of the tradition that has grown up around the icons. The\nfortificationist approach here involves recovering the figures and\nideas with which the icons were in conversation, thereby recovering\nnot just the work of individual thinkers but also their environing\nepistemic communities and discursive contexts. This is the spirit in\nwhich Brittney Cooper\u2019s (2017) Beyond Respectability\nrecovers the work of Fannie Barrier Williams with the National\nAssociation of Colored Women at the turn of the twentieth century. The\nexpansionist version of this approach studies neglected texts or\nfigures, either to mine them for philosophical insight or to fill in\notherwise piecemeal histories. In this spirit, John H. McClendon III\nand Stephen C. Ferguson II (2019) offer their remarkable new volume\nAfrican American Philosophers and Philosophy to press for the\nrecovery of card-carrying academic philosophers of African\ndescent.\n6.2 Transforming schools and movements\n\nA second broad category of activity in contemporary Africana\nphilosophy involves something like the improvisational approach\ndiscussed above. Here we find scholars creatively reinventing\nmainstream philosophical traditions, schools, and methods using\nresources from Africana thought. For reasons of space, I can only\nmention a few examples here, and must do so swiftly, on the way to\ncovering this category with nowhere near the depth or breadth it\ndeserves.\n\nThe clearest examples of this transformative tendency often carry the\nsame misleadingly simple adjectival labels as Cedric Robinson\u2019s\nBlack Marxism. Consider Gordon\u2019s pioneering efforts, in\nExistentia Africana (2000) and elsewhere, to define an\nAfricana and decolonial mode of existential phenomenology, and to\nbuild what has become a globe-spanning intellectual community around\nit. Or consider what Gordon calls \u201cAfrican-American\npragmatism,\u201d which has continued to grow and develop in the wake\nof the germinal interventions by West and Harris (Gordon 2008,\n93\u201399). Eddie Glaude (2007) in particular makes clear that this\nwork is not simply about Black people appropriating canonical\nphilosophic resources (or, less kindly, about canonical theory\n\u201cin blackface,\u201d as it were). Very much in the spirit of\nRobinson\u2019s intervention, it is about the way Africana\nintellectual traditions sometimes anticipate and improve upon the\nmoves that define our artificially circumscribed mainstream\ntraditions, and about contemporary scholars putting these traditions\ninto mutually enriching conversation.\n\nWhat Gordon calls \u201cAfrican American analytical philosophy\u201d\n(2008, 110) deserves special mention here, as it brings tools from the\ndominant philosophical paradigm in the Anglophone world to bear on\nAfricana thought\u2019s distinctive themes, issues, and figures.\nMills and Shelby, who join Gordon in the top tier of Africana\nphilosophy\u2019s most visible and influential figures, work squarely\nand creatively in the ethico-political wing of this tradition,\nbuilding on the work of founders like Boxill and Appiah with results\nthat will receive further consideration below. Similar inroads are\nbecoming apparent in aesthetics (Taylor 2016), epistemology (Dotson\n2017), philosophy of language (Anderson 2015), and other fields.\n6.3 Shifting geographies\n\nA third broad focus in contemporary Africana philosophy reimagines the\nregional mapping discussed above. The common tripartite division\nbetween the continent, the Caribbean, and the Americas is reasonable,\nas far as it goes. But some newer work emphasizes the areas that this\nscheme leaves out.\n\nOne area of focus refuses to reduce the diaspora to the Caribbean and\nthe United States, and explores relatively underappreciated Africana\ncommunities. One approach here, championed by Chike Jeffers (2012),\nPeter James Hudson and Aaron Kamugisha (2014), and others, considers\nthe prospects for specifically Canadian forms of Africana thought.\nAnother approach focuses on the diaspora in Europe. Alanna\nLockward\u2019s (2013) BEBoP (Black Europe Body Politics) curatorial\nproject is one striking example of this work, as are the contributions\nby Barnor Hesse (2009) and others to the volume Black Europe and\nthe African Diaspora.\n\nA second area focuses on certain internal complexities of the standard\nracialized geography. This is the spirit in which a growing cohort of\nthinkers is taking up the question of Africa\u2019s white\ninhabitants. These descendants of the settler colonial populations\nhave come of age at some remove from the colonial incursion, were born\non the continent, and, especially in South Africa, have their fortunes\nand senses of themselves bound up in complicated ways with\nAfrica\u2019s prospects. It is unsurprising, then, that their place\non the continent and, as we\u2019ll see below, in the discipline, has\nbecome a subject of philosophical reflection. Samantha Vice\u2019s\n(2010) germinal essay, \u201cHow Do I Live in This Strange\nPlace?\u201d, anchored a version of this discussion in South\n Africa.[5]\n7. Reading the contemporary\u2014evolving themes\n\nWhile the three broad categories of activity discussed so far explore\nthemes that bear on the structure of Africana philosophy as a field,\nthe fourth category reflects more directly on the field\u2019s\nevolving thematic emphases. A number of contemporary interventions\nupdate these defining themes in light of evolving conditions, debates,\nand conceptual resources. Several suggestive examples follow.\n7.1 Gender and sexuality\n\nOne of the key areas of contemporary interest in Africana\nphilosophy\u2014the study of gender and sexuality\u2014is both\npromising and difficult to summarize. In fact, describing it as a\nsingle area would be unforgivably misleading were it not for the\nexpository constraints of this exercise and for all of the\nqualifications that will soon follow. It is less an area than an array\nof topics and issues that have yet to come into focus as a subfield in\nAfricana philosophy in the way they have elsewhere. A detailed study\nof the reasons for the field\u2019s elusiveness are beyond the scope\nof this entry, but it is worth noting that the most obvious\nfactors\u2014the existence of structures that have historically\ndiscouraged or openly excluded the study of these issues or the\nparticipation of the people most likely to take an interest in\nthem\u2014are among the subjects that researchers in this area take\nup.\n\nThese difficulties notwithstanding, studies of gender and sexuality\nare becoming increasingly prominent in Africana philosophy, thanks in\npart to a thaw in the historically constraining structures mentioned\nabove. The issues driving these studies are not new, however, so one\nway to choose a path through this sprawling territory involves simply\ntracking the impact of some germinal texts and influential authors\nfrom earlier periods. Proceeding in this way will require speeding\npast a version of the important question posed by Saba Fatima and her\ncolleagues (2017): how do the various fields that might implicate or\ntransect Africana studies of gender and sexuality\u2014fields like\ndecolonial feminism, Black queer theory, women of color feminism,\nthird world feminism, Black feminism, and so on\u2014relate to each\nother? Treating this difficulty with the care it deserves is beyond\nthe scope of this project. I will simply stipulate to two assumptions:\nthat the categories \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cAfricana\u201d\noverlap sufficiently to justify treating studies of Black gender and\nBlack sexuality as relevant for Africana thought; and that expanding\nthe zone of overlap to include thinkers who might self-identify with\none of the other categories (decolonial, third world, etc.) will\nreveal some useful continuities in the various projects.\n\nOne influential text to consider is Collins\u2019s Black Feminist\nThought. The editors of the journal Ethnic and Racial\nStudies introduce an anniversary symposium on the book by noting\nthat its publication \u201ccan be seen as a turning point in the\nstudy of the intersections between race, class and gender\u2026 .\nIndeed, in terms of books on race and ethnicity that have been\npublished over recent decades, few, if any, have surpassed it in terms\nof its reach as well as its influence\u201d (Bulmer and Solomos 2015,\n2314). This influence extends well into philosophy, as indicated by\nthe two philosophers, both black feminists, who participated in a 2015\nsymposium otherwise made up of (theory-oriented) social scientists.\nFocusing briefly on their work will provide useful windows onto\nemerging developments in the field.\n\nKristie Dotson and Kathryn Belle testify eloquently in word and deed\nto Collins\u2019s impact on their work, and thereby to Collins\u2019\nimpact on the field. Dotson describes Black Feminist Thought\nas \u201cone of the most comprehensive treatments of knowledge\nproblems and the oppression of black women in the USA to date,\u201d\nand praises the way it \u201chighlights epistemological failures as\nan important layer of oppression\u201d (Dotson 2015, 2323).\nDotson\u2019s research (2012, 2017) draws this (and many other\ninfluences) out in the direction of (among much else) a political\nepistemology that engages vigorously with the conditions that have\nboth excluded Black feminism from philosophy and obscured the\ncoherence and relevance of Black feminist intellectual traditions.\nThis scholarly production is continuous with Dotson\u2019s efforts in\nother spheres, like her work with Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\u2019s\nAfrican American Policy Forum and the trainings she offers on feminist\npedagogy.\n\nWhile Dotson focuses on the epistemological dimensions of\nCollins\u2019s exercises in \u201ccritical social theory\u201d\n(Collins 1989, xiv), Belle focuses on its existential and\nphenomenological dimensions. She explains that Collins\u2019s work\n\u201cunderscores the importance of safe spaces for Black women to\nspeak freely as a necessary condition of resistance and\nempowerment\u201d (Belle 2015, 2345). This orientation to agency,\nvoice, and discursive community clearly informs Belle\u2019s work as\na scholar (Davidson, Gines, and Marcano 2010). But it also shapes her\nwork as an institution-builder, most clearly as the driving force\nbehind the Collegium for Black Women Philosophers, which since 2007\nhas aimed, as she puts it, \u201cto create a safe space for Black\nwomen philosophers \u2026 to support, encourage and learn from one\nanother\u201d (Belle 2015, 2345).\n\nIf the opportunity to \u201cinherit\u201d the work of Patricia Hill\nCollins (as Dotson [2015] puts it in the title to her piece on\nCollins) has inspired two influential figures in contemporary U.S.\nBlack feminist philosophy, the issues at the heart of another\nauthor\u2019s germinal text help drive another strain in Africana\nphilosophical studies of gender and sexuality. Nigerian sociologist\nOyeronke Oyewumi\u2019s The Invention of Women (1997) helped\nmake her, as Azille Coetzee and Annemie Halsema put it, \u201cone of\nthe most famous and at the same time contested scholars in African\nfeminist thought\u201d (Coetzee and Halsema 2018, 179). Douglas Ficek\nexplains that her \u201ccentral claim is that gender is not an\nindigenous organizing principle in Yor\u00f9b\u00e1land, that the\n\u2018body-reasoning\u2019 and \u2018bio-logic\u2019 of the West\nare present neither in the language nor in the epistemology of the\nYor\u00f9b\u00e1\u201d (Ficek 2006, 543). This view immediately\ninspired considerable pushback, including sustained scrutiny from\nmultiple contributors to the special African feminisms issue of\nQuest: A Journal of African Philosophy that appeared in\n 2006.[6]\n Oyewumi\u2019s arguments still help frame contemporary efforts to\nrethink the role of gender in African life, as evidenced by her\nprominent role in the articles on gender and feminism in the recent\nPalgrave Companion (e.g., du Toit and Coetzee 2017).\n\nLegal theorist Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw has provided another\ncornerstone for ongoing contemporary reflection on gender and\nsexuality, but has important (and underappreciated) implications well\nbeyond these areas. In two germinal articles from 1989 and 1991, she\nintroduced an account of intersectionality that inspired \u201cthe\nkind of interdisciplinary and global engagement\u201d that\n\u201c[v]ery few theories have generated\u201d (Carbado et al. 2013,\n303). She says in the second of these articles that she began using\nthe notion of intersectionality \u201cto denote the various ways in\nwhich race and gender interact to shape the multiple dimensions of\nBlack women\u2019s employment experiences\u201d (Crenshaw 1991,\n 1244).[7]\n A cottage industry of commentary and analysis has grown up from this\nsimple beginning, with scholars, artists, critics, and activists\ndebating the meanings and proper uses of\n\u201cintersectionality\u201d nearly as much as they employ it.\nIntersectionality remains a hotly contested notion in part because it\nraises a variety of deeply philosophical questions. Scholars have\nasked, for example, what intersectionality means for theories of\npersonal identity, whether it adequately captures the complexity of\nhuman experience, how it bears on the prospects for coalition\npolitics, why this notion stands out from a family of related, older\nnotions in social theory that do similar work, whether standard\napproaches to intersectionality take Black masculinity seriously\nenough, and much more besides.\n\nThe best way to close this section would be to discuss queer\ntheory\u2019s growing impact on Africana philosophy, but there is\nfrustratingly little to say. Many studies outside of philosophy\nexhibit considerable philosophical depth, starting with the pioneering\nwork of Cathy Cohen in political science and continuing with the work\nof figures like C. Riley\n Snorton.[8]\n I have to this point been willing, on the principled grounds noted\nabove, to put card-carrying philosophers into conversation with\nthinkers outside the discipline; but the size of the gap between work\ninside and outside the field is so stark in this case that it deserves\nspecial comment.\n\nAfricana philosophy has yet to take up in earnest the challenge that\nhas roiled Black studies and related fields over the last decade and a\nhalf. Dwight McBride stated this challenge clearly in 2007:\n\n\nTelling the truths of Black life in the United States requires a\nmultiplicity of voices. It takes voices invested in the stories and\nexperiences of Black men and women; Black heterosexuals and Black\ngays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender folk \u2026 Black single\nparents \u2026 and so very much more. When we allow ourselves to be\nsummed up by sanitized versions of Black life in adherence to a form\nof Black respectability, we tell only part of our story. (McBride\n2007, 438\u2013439)\n\n\nMcBride offers these remarks on the way to calling for a \u201cnew\nBlack Studies\u201d that attends more carefully to issues of\nintra-racial diversity. Some version of this call is surely relevant\nfor Africana philosophy. For this reason, forthcoming work by V.\nDenise James and Anika Simpson is particularly welcome in the U.S.\ncontext. (I\u2019ll leave it to commentators with more intimate\nknowledge of other contexts to comment on the promising developments\nelsewhere.) James is working on a philosophical treatment of Audre\nLorde, and Simpson is preparing a study of the way a responsible\nengagement with single black motherhood requires a queering of\nstandard philosophical approaches to family, sexuality, gender, and\npolitical\n life.[9]\n7.2 Critical ethnophilosophy\n\nThe notion of ethnophilosophy arose in the context of debates about\nAfrican philosophy\u2019s proper content and methods, and was most\ncommonly deployed, most prominently by Paulin Hountondji, \u201cas a\nkind of negative characterization of \u2026 the traditionalist\napproach to African philosophy\u201d (Wiredu 2004, 3). Hallen\ndescribes the worrisome version of this approach:\n\n\nEthnophilosophy presents itself as a philosophy of peoples rather than\nof individuals; in African societies one is therefore given the\nimpression that there can be no equivalent to a Socrates or to a Zeno.\nEthnophilosophy speaks only of Bantu philosophy, Dogon philosophy,\nYoruba philosophy\u2026 . Ethnophilosophy\u2019s sources are in the\npast, in what is described as authentic, traditional African \u2026\nprior to \u2018\u2018modernity.\u2019\u2019 These are to be found\nprimarily in products of language: parables, proverbs, poetry, songs,\nmyths\u2026 . [E]thnophilosophy therefore tends to portray African\nbeliefs as things \u2026 that are somehow timeless \u2026 placing\nminimal emphasis upon the rigorous argumentation and criticism that\nare prerequisites to the \u2026 search for truth. (Hallen 2004,\n122)\n\n\nI refer to this as the worrisome version of traditionalism because\nHountondji and others have made room for the possibility of a less\nworrisome, more critical form of traditionalism. Paget Henry, for\nexample, has reclaimed the notion of ethnophilosophy to denote an\nhistorically and culturally rooted corrective to overly abstract\naccounts of the unity of Africana philosophy. He puts it this way:\n\u201cIn spite of the controversy that has raged over the practice of\nethnophilosophy, I think it is a necessary component \u2026 of all\nAfricana-oriented philosophies\u201d (Henry 2000, 154).\n\nHenry here joins Appiah (1993) in calling for a kind of\ncritical ethnophilosophy, which excavates the insights of\nAfricana cultures and makes them philosophically cognizable without\ninsulating them from critical scrutiny or freezing them in the\nprecolonial\n amber.[10]\n The prospect of this sort of work continues to draw attention and\ninspire researchers. One of the clearest examples of this, apart from\nHenry\u2019s approach to Afro-Caribbean philosophy, is in the growing\nliterature seeking to bring specifically African philosophical\nconcepts into contemporary debates in ethics and political philosophy.\nThe notion of ubuntu is probably the most frequent and prominent\nrecipient of this treatment, in ways that have generated considerable\ncontroversy (to which we will return). But there are many other\nexamples. Consider, for example, Mbih Jerome Tosam\u2019s (2014)\nstudy of the philosophical underpinnings of Kom proverbs or Adebola B.\nEkanola\u2019s (2017) examination of the Yor\u00f9b\u00e1\nconception of peace. Outside of the continent, and alongside\nHenry\u2019s redeployment of traditionalism, one finds a growing\nnumber of pieces like Lindsey Stewart\u2019s (2017) study of Hoodoo\nlove rituals as models for the practice of freedom.\n\nAn important set of debates in critical ethnophilosophy grew up around\nthe study of ubuntu in South Africa, and around the role of white\nphilosophers in this work. Thaddeus Metz (2007) and Mogobe Ramose\n(2015) have been perhaps the clearest spokespersons for the positions\nthat, for current purposes, are the keys to the\n debate.[11]\n On one side are scholars who aim to treat the concept of ubuntu as\nanother resource for the work of ethics and political philosophy, and\nwho regard this approach as an expression of respect for indigenous\nAfrican resources. On the other side are scholars for whom the sudden\n\u201cmainstreaming\u201d of African concepts is extremely\nsuspicious, often for reasons very much like the ones that motivate\nworries about the misappropriation of cultural practices related to\naesthetic experience. A short, gentle version of the worry might go\nlike this: In a majority black country with a majority white\nphilosophy professoriate, a country in which the professoriate assumed\nits shape over time not by dint of natural forces or by accident but\nthanks to the careful hoarding of resources and opportunities along\nracial lines, it is unseemly and perhaps blameworthy for white\nphilosophers to start mining resources from African cultures without\nfirst transforming its institutional structures to grant substantive\naccess to people from those cultures (and, Ramose [2015] points out,\noften without learning the relevant languages the way they would learn\nGreek to study the Stoics in earnest). There are of course ways to\ndevelop this worry and ways to respond to it; the point right now is\nsimply to mark debates around it as an example of an area of recent\ninterest in and around Africana philosophy.\n7.3 Political thought in context\n\nA third theme in contemporary work also has obvious roots in older\ntrends. As an enterprise \u201cborn of struggle,\u201d Africana\nphilosophy attends with unusual frequency and consistency to the\nethical and political issues facing its inquirers. The ethical\nimplications of studies in nearly every area, including metaphysics\n(related, say, to the concept of the person) and epistemology\n(related, say, to issues of testimonial injustice), are rarely far\nfrom view. But straightforward political philosophy remains as lively\nan area of investigation as it was when Odera Oruka famously\nidentified \u201cnationalist-ideological\u201d theorizing as one of\nthe four major areas of African philosophical activity (Oruka 1981,\nn.p.).\n\nAfricana philosophies of politics constitute much too massive an area\nto cover responsibly in anything like the space available here. In\naddition, this is an area in which regional and local differences loom\nparticularly large, thereby complicating any broad generalizations.\nNevertheless, three trends are worth noting.\n\nFirst, commentary on iconic figures remains a common undertaking,\nthough the range of figures available for this treatment has of course\nchanged over time. The iconic figures in each region remain live\noptions for study, as evidenced by recent special issues of the\nJournal on African Philosophy on Nkrumah and Azikiwe,\npersistent interest in a variety of venues in Du Bois and Cooper, and\nrecent attempts to rethink the legacies of Senghor and\n Cesaire.[12]\n The contemporary difference is that this work now more often shares\nspace with studies of people like C.L.R. James, Huey Newton, Lorraine\nHansberry, and bell\n hooks.[13]\n\nSecond, and similarly, while scholars continue to undertake\ncontext-sensitive investigations of particular, local issues, those\nissues have changed in the wake of certain epochal, geopolitical\nshifts. The sheer range of issues in play here is particularly\ndaunting, but Ivan Karp and D. A. Masolo provide a helpfully capacious\nframe. They suggest three roughly ten-year stages in the development\nof post-independence African philosophy. The 1970s, they say, were\nabout the ethnophilosophy debates, while the 1980s were about\ncriticizing African modes of cultural production, from traditional\npractices to elite intellectual work. The 1990s, meanwhile, took up a\nnew challenge:\n\n\nThis new phase \u2026 is both a response to and an attempt to\ntheorize the crisis of the postcolonial African state, and it\ncoincides with the emergence of economic, social, and environmental\nproblems that were not imagined to be possible in the utopian worlds\nof newly independent nations. (Karp and Masolo 2000, 2, as quoted in\nAfayolan and Falola 2017, 9)\n\n\nKarp and Masolo\u2019s (2000) description of this new, post-utopian\nphase tracks important dynamics unfolding in Africana communities\nacross the world. In some places it often took the form of reflections\non the disappointments of post-racialism, in many places focused\nintently on the exaggerated optimism and subsequent disappointments of\nthe Obama era. Elsewhere it took the form of reflections on\nneoliberalism or on the imperatives not of anti-colonial struggle or\npost-colonial critique but of decolonial transformation. Central to\nall these cases, though, was the challenge of adapting Africana\nphilosophical resources to evolving political conditions in the wake\nof the Cold War, in the throes of a global war on terror and a\nmultipolar scramble for post-imperial influence.\n\nA third trend shaping Africana philosophies of politics is simply that\na variety of new theories and concepts have come into play. Some of\nthese come, as we have seen, from exercises in critical\nethnophilosophy, like the ubuntu debates in South Africa. Others\nresult from creative conceptual engineering by attentive scholars\ngrappling with their social worlds. Consider here the notion of\nAfropolitanism, first authoritatively theorized in the early 2000s by\nAchille Mbembe, who used it to argue that \u201cthe meaning of\n\u2018being African\u2019 had to be dislodged from race \u2026 and\nbe opened to the flows of global networks and worldly\nhybridities\u201d (Balakrishnan 2017, \u00a74, par. 5). Or consider\nTommie Shelby\u2019s introduction and refusal of the \u201cmedical\nmodel\u201d of social theorizing in relation to urban\n\u201cghettos\u201d (Shelby 2016). Or, finally, consider the\ncontinuing reverberations from Mills\u2019s enormously influential\nracial contract argument (1997).\n\nMills and Shelby are particularly noteworthy in this connection. Until\ntheir early work earned the attention it now enjoys around the world\nand across academic disciplines, it was easier to worry that analytic\napproaches to Africana thought did relatively little with the\ntransformative potential that Africanaity brings to professional\nphilosophy (see Taylor 2009, Gordon 2006). But both have\nrecently called explicitly for \u201cblack radical\u201d approaches\nto standard political-theoretic positions like egalitarianism and\nliberalism (Mills 2017, Shelby 2016). And both have backed up this\ncall by reinventing core theoretical resources from one tradition in\nlight of the other. For example, Mills (1997) reworks the social\ncontract tradition by examining it from the perspective of (a kind of)\ndecolonial or black radicalism, while Shelby (2005) uses elements of\nRawlsian contract theory to rework the black nationalism of figures\nlike Crummell, Du Bois, and Karenga.\n7.4 Black life and social death\n\nA final theme in contemporary Africana philosophy brings us full\ncircle, in a way. It reflects the imperatives of a philosophy born of\nstruggle, it draws out and builds on the core idea of problematicity,\nand it reflects the ongoing effort, just discussed, to find ever more\nadequate conceptual tools for engaging deep problems. This\ntheme\u2014call it a focus on Black life and social\ndeath\u2014unites several different currents of thought and activism,\nall radically distinct but all interested in the ethical and\nexistential stakes of Black life in a world that remains anti-Black\nnot just at the level of individual prejudices but also at the level\nof sociopolitical, epistemic, axiological, and ontological\nstructures.\n\nOne approach to this work eventuates in the Afro-pessimism of Frank\nWilderson, Saidiya Hartman, and others, or in the debates about the\nview between its advocates and those who decline to claim it, like\nMoten. This is a notoriously difficult approach to pin down, in small\npart because a very different view, much more prominent in\ninternational relations than in political theory and philosophy, goes\nby the same\n name.[14]\n With respect to the philosophical view that is our concern here,\nJared Sexton, quoting Bryan Wagner, describes it as \u201camong other\nthings, an attempt to formulate an account of [Black] suffering\n\u2026 \u2018without recourse to the consolation of\ntranscendence\u2019\u201d (Wagner 2009, 2, as quoted in Sexton 2016,\npar. 8). Elsewhere in this remarkable essay, aimed at clearing away\nthe misconceptions and misguided criticisms that swirl around the\nview, Sexton explains:\n\n\nAfro-pessimism is not an intervention so much as it is a reading or\nmeta-commentary\u2026 . It is a reading of what is gained and lost\nin the attempt\u2014the impulse\u2014to \u2026 delimit the\n\u201cbad news\u201d of black life, to fix its precise scope and\nscale, to find an edge beyond or before which true living unfolds.\n(Sexton 2016, par. 16)\n\n\nThe content of and motivation for this reading involves \u201cboth an\nepistemological and an ethical project\u201d (Sexton 2016, par. 15).\nThe ethical project involves resisting a lazy, bad faith optimism that\nbases struggle and activism on hope rather than on a clear-eyed\nconfrontation with the challenges of Black life in an anti-Black\nworld. The epistemological project involves finding the tools for\nachieving this clear-eyed confrontation. In the hands of figures like\nHartman and Christina Sharpe, this means enacting certain vital\nconceptual reorientations, like insisting on the afterlife of the\ntransatlantic slave trade in contemporary modes of social\norganization.\n\nA second way of engaging black life and social death philosophically\ncrystallizes in the various organizational forms and\nanti-organizational tendencies that constitute the Black Lives Matter\nmovement. This is of course not an academic enterprise, but it grows\nfrom many of the same roots, intellectually and ethically, as much of\nthe work under consideration here. The driving forces behind the\nmovement\u2014people like Alicia Garza, Patrice Cullors-Khan, and\nOpal Tometi, the authors of the phrase-cum-social media archiving tool\nthat gives the movement its name\u2014take up expressly philosophical\nquestions about, for example, the requirements of justice, the role of\nthe state (and the legitimacy of state violence), the workings of\npower, and the meaning of the human. What\u2019s more, they often do\nso in ways informed by figures like Fanon, Audre Lorde, Steve Biko,\nand Cedric Robinson. This is philosophy in action: it is \u201cabout\nfinding, articulating, and promoting answers to philosophical\nquestions\u201d as well as about \u201cmodeling a kind of\nphilosophical responsiveness to the conditions of human\nstriving\u201d\u2014call this a robustly engaged version of the art\nof living well (Taylor 2019,\n 297).[15]\n\nA third approach to the questions of black life and social death\nactually runs through both of the approaches mentioned so far. The\nstudy of Black aesthetics and of African-derived cultural practices\nhave become scholarly growth areas thanks in part\u2014but only in\npart\u2014to the central role that aesthetic practices play in the\nwork of antiracist resistance. I say \u201conly in part\u201d\nbecause some of the most interesting work in this area prominently\nresists the temptation to reduce aesthesis to anti-racism. Life in\ncommunities of African-descended persons and others racialized as\nBlack, like life everywhere, has its irremediably aesthetic dimensions\nand resources. These resources are sometimes invested in defensive\nefforts, warding off assaults on Black or African humanity. But they\nare much more often invested in celebrations of life, reflections on\ncommunity, parables of love, provocations for the mind and senses, and\nso on. In fact, a plausible reading of the transnational,\ntranshistorical tradition of Black aesthetics suggests that this work\nroutinely circles around the tension between responsibly facing\nlife\u2019s problems and celebrating and enjoying life\u2019s\npossibilities (Taylor 2016). This tension motivates Albert\nMurray\u2019s charges against Toni Morrison (and others), it inspires\nWest\u2019s critique of Du Bois, and it runs through, without quite\ndefining, Moten\u2019s refusal of Afro-pessimism.\n\nThe contemporary concern with aesthetics in and near Africana thought\nextends a long tradition. Frederick Douglass, for example,\ncomplemented his achievements as a writer and orator with vigorous\nefforts to construct his public image through photography, thereby\nmaking a germinal contribution to modern transatlantic visual culture\n(Gates 2016). The U.S. \u201cNew Negro\u201d movement (usually\nassociated with the Harlem Renaissance), the Negritude movement, and\nthe various Black arts movements around the world were all animated by\nphilosophical commitments, and in the first two cases prominently\nfeatured philosophers (Alain Locke and Leopold Senghor, to start).\nMoving closer to the present, the companion volumes that marked\nAfricana philosophy\u2019s establishment feature contributions on art\nand aesthetics by Nzegwu (2004) and others. Contemporary thinkers\nfollow in their footsteps with special issues on race and aesthetics,\nsymposia on Black aesthetics, and studies of the philosophical import\nof memorials and monuments in racialized\n spaces.[16]\n8. Conclusion\n\nTo discuss studies of black life and social death in the context of\nthis entry is to return to one of the recurring tensions in the field\nof Africana philosophy. It is a field not just born of struggle but\nalso emerging from the crucible of racialization. Africana philosophy\nis importantly related but not reducible to a responsible\nphilosophical race theory: it is a constellation of views, approaches,\ntraditions, problems, debates, and figures that owes its existence as\na somewhat unitary enterprise at least in part to the practices of\nrace-making, but that reaches deeper into the lives of particular\ncommunities than race theory can, with results\u2014like studies of\nthe Yoruba conception of peace\u2014that in no way depend on\nrace-theoretic analysis for their import.\n\nThis study of course leaves out much more than it includes. There is,\nfor example, nothing here about Nkiru Nzegwu\u2019s innovative\ninstitution-building efforts with the International Society for\nAfrican Philosophy and Studies\n (ISAPS)[17]\n and the Africa Knowledge Project, or about Sylvia Wynter\u2019s\nimpactful interventions in decolonial and Afro-Caribbean\n philosophy.[18]\n Nor will there be space to explore Achille Mbembe\u2019s studies of\nnecropolitics, George Yancy\u2019s remarkable reinvention of critical\nphenomenology, the long shadow of Molefi Asante\u2019s Africology,\nthe innovations of Tommy Curry\u2019s Black male studies, Anita\nAllen-Castellitto\u2019s insightful studies of privacy and her\neloquent commentaries on the profession, or the dynamic Afro-futurism\nof figures from Sun-Ra to Janelle Monae.\n\nSilences and oversights are inevitable in a short study of a sprawling\nconstellation of related areas of inquiry. For that reason it is\nfitting to end with language from Outlaw\u2019s version of a similar\nstudy. One might say of this entry what Outlaw says of his: that it\n\u201cis not meant to be exhaustive,\u201d but instead\n\u201cprovides examples and solicits additional contributions in\norder to make the account more comprehensive and accurate\u201d\n(Outlaw 2017, \u00a72, par. 23).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abdel-Shehid, G., and Kolia, Z., 2017, \u201cIn Light of the\nMaster: Re-reading C\u00e9saire and Fanon,\u201d <em>C.L.R.
