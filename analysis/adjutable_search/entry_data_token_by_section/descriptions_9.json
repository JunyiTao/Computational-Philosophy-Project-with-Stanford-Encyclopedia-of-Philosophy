    "main_text": "Extensions of the Theory of Descriptions || Indefinite descriptions\n4.3 Indefinite descriptions\n\nMost of the action in the philosophy of language has been with\ndefinite descriptions, but indefinite descriptions have also generated\na fair bit of attention\u2014some of it mirroring the debates about\ndefinite descriptions. For example Chastain (1975), Donnellan (1978),\nWilson (1978), and Fodor and Sag (1982), held that indefinite\ndescriptions are ambiguous between referential and quantificational\ninterpretations. That is to say, there are referential and\nquantificational uses of indefinite descriptions and these are a\nreflex of a genuine semantical ambiguity. The basic structure of their\nargument was the following. Referential uses of indefinites must be\neither a function of quantifier scope or a semantically referential\nindefinite determiner. Since indefinites with the relevant scopal\nproperties would violate standard syntactic constraints, indefinites\nmust in some cases be semantically referential.\n\nExamples of the kinds of syntactic considerations they had in mind\ninclude island constraints like the following. Quantified expressions\nare ordinarily considered to be clause bound. So, for example, a\nsentence like (26) is not supposed to have the interpretation in\n(26\u2032), where the quantified expression takes wide scope.\n\n\n(26) Someone believes that every man I know is angry.\n\n(26\u2032) *[every y: man(y) and know(I,y)]([Some\nx: person(x)](x believes that y is\nangry))\n\n\nOn the other hand, it seems more natural to say that (27) can have the\ninterpretation corresponding to the structure in (27\u2032).\n\n\n(27) Everyone believes that a man I know is angry.\n\n(27\u2032) [An x: man(x) and\nknow(I,x)]([every y: person(y)](y\nbelieves that x is angry))\n\n\nA more compelling example of an island constraint would be the\nantecedent of a conditional, as in (28), which is not supposed to have\nthe interpretation in (28\u2032).\n\n\n(28) If every person I know is happy then I will be happy.\n\n(28\u2032) *[every x: person(x) and\nknow(I,x)](if x is happy then I will be happy)\n\n\nBut a \u201cwide understanding\u201d of (29) does seem to be\npossible.\n\n\n(29) If a person I know is happy then I will be happy.\n\n(29\u2032) [An x: person(x) and\nknow(I,x)](if x is happy then I will be happy)\n\n\nThe moral was supposed to be that these \u201cwide\u201d readings\nare not the reflex of wide scope quantification (that would be to make\nindefinite descriptions syntactically special), but rather due to the\nfact that the indefinites in these examples are referring\nexpressions.\n\nThe Fodor and Sag argumentation was taken up in the philosophical\nliterature by King (1988) and Ludlow and Neale (1991), who argued that\nthere is a confusion in the Fodor and Sag discussion. Kripke\u2019s\nclaim, of course, was that referential uses of a description are a\nfunction of pragmatics, not quantifier scope. Nor, of course, could a\nreferential use be associated with wide scope, as Kripke (1977) argued\nforcefully\u2014they simply are not the same phenomenon. The problem\nis that the Fodor and Sag arguments do not address the pragmatic\naccount of referential uses, which of course was the alternative\nadvanced by Kripke.\n\nIn addition, there do appear to be more quantifier scope possibilities\nthan the Fodor and Sag proposal seems to allow. Consider (30), from\nLudlow and Neale and (31) from Kripke.\n\n\n(30) Each teacher overheard many exclamations that a student of mine\ncheated.\n\n(31) Hoover charged that the Berrigans plotted to kidnap a high\nAmerican official.\n\n\nIn the case of (30) \u2018a student of mine\u2019 can have narrow\nscope with respect to \u2018every teacher\u2019 but wide scope with\nrespect to \u2018many exclamations\u2019. Similarly, as Kripke\n(1977) observed, intermediate scope is possible in (24) (as when the\nBerrigans have someone in mind, but Hoover does not know who). Similar\nobservations about the possibility of intermediate scope have been\nmade by Farkas (1981), Rooth and Partee (1982), King (1988), Ruys\n(1992) and Abusch (1994). How are Fodor and Sag supposed to generate\nreadings like that, given only a referential/quantificational\nambiguity and no relative scope relations? As Kripke put the point,\n\u201cno two-fold distinction can replace Russell\u2019s notion of\nscope.\u201d While this tells against referential analysis of\nindefinites, it opens a can of worms for the other approaches as well;\nfor example, if indefinite descriptions are ordinary quantified\nexpressions, then why do they have such extraordinary island-escaping\nproperties (or at least appear to)?\n\nOne attractive possibility that has emerged from the literature in\nDiscourse Representation Theory\u2014in particular in work by Heim\n(1982), Kamp (1984), Deising (1992), Kamp and Reyle (1993)\u2014has\nbeen that the appearance of a determiner in an indefinite description\nis chimeral\u2014\u2018a man\u2019 in fact comes to an expression\ncontaining a predicate and a free variable, as in \u2018man\nx\u2019. This free variable might then be picked up by some\nsort of discourse operator as discussed in the previous section.\n\nAccordingly, a sentence like (1) might have a logical form, or better,\na discourse representation structure akin to (1*) (abstracting from\ndetails).\n\n(1*) [[man(x) came in the room] [x turned on the\nTV]]\n\n\nThis general strategy gives us some explanation for why indefinites\nsometimes appear to have island escaping properties as in cases like\nconditionals. The answer is that they don\u2019t escape at all, but\nare free variables that are bound by (or existentially closed by)\noperators outside of the island. This describes the DRT strategy only\nin the most general of terms, but we can already see that the\nquestions that plague the Russellian story have their reflex here as\nwell. Everyone now recognizes that intermediate scope is a possibility\nin cases like (30) and (31), but the question is just what mechanisms\nmake it possible? The Russellian has to opt for operators with unusual\nisland escaping properties. What is the DRT theorist to do?\n\nOne option, explored by Reinhart (1996), Kratzer (1995), and Winter\n(1997), employs the device of choice functions. As Winter informally\ncharacterizes the doctrine, the idea is as follows.\n\n\n(A1) Indefinites lack quantificational force of their own\n\n(A2) An indefinite NP in an argument position, however, ends up\ndenoting an individual, because the semantics involves a free function\nvariable that assigns an individual to the restriction predicate.\n\n(A3) This function variable is existentially closed, together with the\nrestriction that it is a choice function: a function that chooses a\nmember from any non-empty predicate it gets.\n\n\nHow does this help in the case of intermediate scope? For Reinhart\n(1996), choice functions by themselves cannot account for the extant\nphenomena (in particular cases of intermediate scope), so the theory\nmust be supplemented with standard quantifier raising accounts as\nwell. Winter (1997) has offered a more general account employing\nchoice functions (also extending the account to plural indefinites)\nthat purport to make do without the additional resource of quantifier\nraising.\n\nThe interesting conceptual issue that arises, whether we opt for\nstandard DRT accounts or such accounts supplemented with choice\nfunctions, is whether this departs from the Russellian analysis of\nindefinite descriptions in important ways. In one respect, of course,\nthe accounts are very different\u2014Russell takes indefinite\ndescriptions to be existential quantifiers, while the DRT accounts\ntake them to be akin to free variables. On the other hand, once the\nfree variables are interpreted the effect comes to very much the same\nthing: in both cases the accounts are fundamentally\nquantificational.\n\nNot everyone has seen DRT theory and choice functions in this light.\nKratzer (1995) maintained that the choice function provided something\nlike a referential interpretation of an indefinite, here understood as\na \u201cpointing gesture within the mind of the speaker,\u201d but\nas Winter points out this raises some difficult methodological issues,\nand in the view of Ludlow and Neale (1991) this amounts to a\nconflation of the notions of referentiality and specificity, and a\nfurther confusion about the nature of specificity. On their view,\nusing an expression with a particular individual in mind is not the\nsame thing as referring to that individual. For example, according to\nLudlow and Neale, there are a number of possible uses to which we can\nput indefinite descriptions, including referential uses, specific\nuses, definite uses, and purely existential uses. To understand this\ndistinction, consider the following cases.\n\n\n\nReferential use. A teacher announces the following to the\nclass, with a single red haired student in the front row.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to name names, but I have good reason to\nbelieve that red haired student in the front row cheated on\nyesterday\u2019s exam.\u201d In this case the teacher has singular\ngrounds for the utterance, and is communicating directly to the\naudience the identity of the individual that serves as the grounds for\nthe utterance. \n\n\nSpecific use. In this case the teacher has singular grounds,\nand wishes to communicate that fact to the audience, but does not wish\nto communicate the identity of the cheater to the class.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to announce that yesterday I witnessed a\nstudent cheating on the exam.\u201d \n\n\nDefinite use: In this case the teacher knows that there must\nhave been a unique cheater, but does not know the identity of the\ncheater and hence does not have singular grounds for the utterance and\naccordingly is not in a position to communicate the identity of the\ncheater except under extraordinary circumstances. \u201cI have\nstatistical evidence that a student cheated on the exam. Fortunately\nthere only appears to be one cheater.\u201d \n\n\nPurely quantificational use: In this instance not only does\nthe teacher fail to know the identity of the cheater, but also fails\nto know whether or not there was a unique cheater (perhaps there were\nseveral). \u201cI have evidence that a student cheated on the exam.\nThe answer sheet was stolen from my office. Hopefully, there was only\none student involved. We will know more pending an\ninvestigation.\u201d \n\n\nAccording to Ludlow and Neale, it is implausible to think that all of\nthese uses can be chalked up to semantic facts. In each case, the\nproposition expressed is argued to be that which would be expressed if\nthe indefinite determiner were replaced by the existential quantifier.\nThe different uses of descriptions then stem from the application of\nGricean principles of conversational implicature to what was literally\nsaid.\n",
