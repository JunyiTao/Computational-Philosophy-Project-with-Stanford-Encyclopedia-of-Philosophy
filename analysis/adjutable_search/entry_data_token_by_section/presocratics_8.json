    "main_text": "Diogenes of Apollonia and the Sophists\n9. Diogenes of Apollonia and the Sophists\n\nIn the last part of the 5th century, Diogenes of Apollonia\n(active after 440 BCE) revived and revised the Milesian system of\ncosmology, claiming that \u201call the things that are are\nalterations from the same thing and are the same thing\u201d\n(64B2/LM28D3); he identified this single basic substance with air,\nlike Anaximenes more than a century before (Graham 2006, Laks 2008,\n2008a). Diogenes takes care to give arguments for the reality and\nproperties of his basic principle. In DK64B2/LM28D3 he says that only\nthings that are alike can affect one another. If there were a\nplurality of basic substances, each differing in what Diogenes calls\ntheir \u201cown proper nature,\u201d there could be no interaction\nbetween them. Yet the evidence of the senses is clear: things mix and\nseparate and interact with one another. Thus, all things must be forms\nof some one single thing. Like Anaxagoras, Diogenes claims that the\ncosmic system is ordered by intelligence, and he argues that that\n\u201cwhich possesses intelligence (no\u0113sis) is what\nhuman beings call air\u201d (DK64B5/LM28D10). Humans and animals live\nby breathing air, and are governed by it \u2014in them air is both\nsoul and intelligence, or mind (DK64B4/LM28D2). Moreover, Diogenes\nargues, air governs and rules all things and is god (DK64B5/LM28D10).\nThus, like Anaxagoras, Diogenes has a theory grounded in intelligence,\nalthough Diogenes is more fully committed to teleological\nexplanations, insofar as he states explicitly that intelligence\n(no\u0113sis) orders things in a good way (DK64B3/LM28D56).\nIn presenting his arguments, Diogenes fulfills his own requirement for\na philosophical claim. In DK64B1/LM28D2 he says, \u201cIn my opinion,\nanyone beginning a logos (account) ought to present a\nstarting principle (arch\u0113) that is indisputable and a\nstyle that is simple and stately.\u201d He notes that his theory that\nair is soul and intelligence \u201cwill have been made clearly\nevident in this book\u201d (DK64B4/LMD9). \n\nTheophrastus says that Diogenes was the last of the physical\nphilosophers, the physiologoi, or \u201cinquirers into\nnature,\u201d as Aristotle called them; Diogenes Laertius\n(Lives II.16\u201317) gives that title to Archelaus, saying that\nhe was the teacher of Socrates (see Betegh 2013a). There was also\nanother group of thinkers active about this time: the Sophists. Many\nof our views about this group have been shaped by Plato\u2019s\naggressively negative assessment of them: in his dialogues Plato\nexpressly contrasts the genuine philosopher, i.e., Socrates, with the\nSophists, especially in their role as teachers of young men growing\ninto their maturity (youths at the age when Socrates, too, engaged\nwith them in his discussions). Modern scholarship (Woodruff and\nGagarin 2008, Kerferd 1981, Guthrie 1969) has shown the diversity of\ntheir views. They were not completely uninterested in the theoretical\nproblems that concerned others of the Presocratics. Gorgias of\nLeontini questioned the possibility of the certainty that Parmenides\nsought. In his On Nature, or On what-is-not, Gorgias\nclaims that nothing satisfies (or can satisfy) Parmenides\u2019\nrequirements for what-is (Mansfeld 1985, Mourelatos 1987b, Palmer\n1999, Caston 2002, Curd 2006). Protagoras, too, doubted the\npossibility of the strong theoretical knowledge that the Presocratics\nchampioned. The Sophists raised ethical and political questions: Does\nlaw or convention ground what is right, or is it a matter of nature?\nThey traveled widely, sometimes serving as diplomats, and they were\nboth entertainers and teachers. They gave public displays of rhetoric\n(this contrasts with Diogenes of Apollonia\u2019s comments about his\nbook, which seems to imply a more private\n enterprise)[12]\n and took on students, teaching both the art of rhetoric and the\nskills necessary for succeeding in Greek political life. With the\nSophists, as with Socrates, interest in ethics and political thought\nbecomes a more prominent aspect of Greek philosophy.\n",
