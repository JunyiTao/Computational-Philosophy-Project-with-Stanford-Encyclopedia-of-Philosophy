    "main_text": "The Concept of Overall Freedom\n7. Is the Distinction Still Useful?\n\nWe began with a simple distinction between two concepts of liberty,\nand have progressed from this to the recognition that liberty might be\ndefined in any number of ways, depending on how one interprets the\nthree variables of agent, constraints, and purposes. Despite the\nutility of MacCallum\u2019s triadic formula and its strong influence\non analytic philosophers, however, Berlin\u2019s distinction remains\nan important point of reference for discussions about the meaning and\nvalue of political and social freedom. Are these continued references\nto positive and negative freedom philosophically well-founded?\n\nIt might be claimed that MacCallum\u2019s framework is less than\nwholly inclusive of the various possible conceptions of freedom. In\nparticular, it might be said, the concept of self-mastery or\nself-direction implies a presence of control that is not captured by\nMacCallum\u2019s explication of freedom as a triadic relation.\nMacCallum\u2019s triadic relation indicates mere\npossibilities. If one thinks of freedom as involving\nself-direction, on the other hand, one has in mind an exercise-concept\nof freedom as opposed to an opportunity-concept (this distinction\ncomes from C. Taylor 1979). If interpreted as an exercise concept,\nfreedom consists not merely in the possibility of doing\ncertain things (i.e. in the lack of constraints on doing them), but in\nactually doing certain things in certain ways \u2014 for\nexample, in realizing one\u2019s true self or in acting on the basis\nof rational and well-informed decisions. The idea of freedom as the\nabsence of constraints on the realization of given ends might be\ncriticised as failing to capture this exercise concept of freedom, for\nthe latter concept makes no reference to the absence of\nconstraints.\n\nHowever, this defence of the positive-negative distinction as\ncoinciding with the distinction between exercise- and\nopportunity-concepts of freedom has been challenged by Eric Nelson\n(2005). As Nelson points out, most of the theorists that are\ntraditionally located in the positive camp, such as Green or\nBosanquet, do not distinguish between freedom as the absence of\nconstraints and freedom as the doing or becoming of certain things.\nFor these theorists, freedom is the absence of any kind of constraint\nwhatsoever on the realization of one\u2019s true self (they adopt a\nmaximally extensive conception of constraints on freedom). The absence\nof all factors that could prevent the action x is,\nquite simply, equivalent to the realization of x. In other\nwords, if there really is nothing stopping me from doing\nx \u2014 if I possess all the means to do x, and I\nhave a desire to do x, and no desire, irrational or\notherwise, not to do x \u2014 then I do x. An\nequivalent way to characterize the difference between such positive\ntheorists and the so-called negative theorists of freedom lies in the\ndegree of specificity with which they describe x. For those\nwho adopt a narrow conception of constraints, x is described\nwith a low degree of specificity (x could be exemplified by\nthe realization of any of a large array of options); for those who\nadopt a broad conception of constraints, x is described with\na high degree of specificity (x can only be exemplified by\nthe realization of a specific option, or of one of a small group of\noptions).\n\nWhat perhaps remains of the distinction is a rough categorization of\nthe various interpretations of freedom that serves to indicate their\ndegree of fit with the classical liberal tradition. There is indeed a\ncertain family resemblance between the conceptions that are normally\nseen as falling on one or the other side of Berlin\u2019s divide,\ndespite there being some uncertainty about which side to locate\ncertain particular conceptions. One of the decisive factors in\ndetermining this family resemblance is the theorist\u2019s degree of\nconcern with the notion of the self. Those on the\n\u2018positive\u2019 side see questions about the nature and sources\nof a person\u2019s beliefs, desires and values as relevant in\ndetermining that person\u2019s freedom, whereas those on the\n\u2018negative\u2019 side, being more faithful to the classical\nliberal tradition, tend to consider the raising of such questions as\nin some way indicating a propensity to violate the agent\u2019s\ndignity or integrity. One side takes a positive interest in the\nagent\u2019s beliefs, desires and values, while the other recommends\nthat we avoid doing so.\n",
