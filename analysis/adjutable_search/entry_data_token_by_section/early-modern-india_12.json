    "main_text": "Philosophical Psychology || Overview of Philosophical Psychology\n5.1 Overview of Philosophical Psychology\n\nStudy of the nature, content and causes of cognition (buddhi,\nj\u00f1\u0101na, upalabdhi) lies at the very centre of the\nNy\u0101ya philosophical method. In epistemology, the question asked\nis: how do we distinguish between true and false cognitions, and under\nwhat conditions does a true cognition arise? In logical theory, the\nissue is: when does one cognition \u2018follow\u2019 from another,\nin some suitably articulated sense. In philosophy of language, the\nassumption is that sentence structure mirrors cognitive structure, and\nhence that an inquiry into sentence meaning proceeds via an analysis\nof the cognitions sentences \u2018express\u2019. The importance of\nthis topic is reflected by The Manual of Reason, for although\n\u2018cognition\u2019 is technically just one of twenty-four types\nof quality in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika schema, its analysis accounts\nfor nearly half of the book (TS 34\u201374).\n\nThe term \u2018cognition\u2019 is used by the Naiy\u0101yikas to\nrefer to any intentional (sa-vi\u1e63ayaka; object-directed)\nmental state, including states of perceiving, inferring, doubting,\nguessing, remembering, etc., but excluding desiring, hoping,\nsuffering, etc. (cf. Matilal 1968: 7\u20138). Because we say that the\nsubject has such states, they are thought to be\n\u2018qualities\u2019 (in the technical Vai\u015be\u1e63ika sense)\nof the soul. The Manual of Reason states that a cognition is\nthe \u201cground for all linguistic practice\u201d (TS 34),\nreflecting the Ny\u0101ya conception of language as primarily an\ninstrument for transmitting true thoughts from speaker to hearer.\n\nFrom the point of view of epistemology, the most important division,\nwithin the class of cognitions, is between those which are true and\nthe rest. However, the standard Ny\u0101ya classification of the\nspecies of cognition, repeated by The Manual of Reason,\nbegins with another division, between memory cognitions\n(sm\u1e5bti) and the remainder (anubhava;\nnonrecollective cognition). The full classification is as follows:\n\n\ncognition \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\nnonrecollective\n                 (anubhava)\n\nmemory\n                 (sm\u1e5bti)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\ntrue (pram\u0101)\n   perceptual \n   inferential \n   comparison-based \n   testimony-based\nnot true (apram\u0101)\n   false (viparyaya; 4 types)\n   doubt (sa\u1e43\u015baya)\n   tarka\n\n\u2018true\u2019 (yath\u0101rtha)\n\u2018not true\u2019 (ayath\u0101rtha)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nNy\u0101ya epistemology is in effect a theory of the true\nnonrecollective cognitions, and their division into four types on the\nbasis of the different accredited epistemic means\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a-s) by which they are produced. (What\nabout accidentally true cognitions, e.g. the result of a lucky guess?\nThere are well-discussed problems with incorporating them into the\nabove schema). It is clear that, no matter how generally reliable are\nour epistemic methods, it will always be possible for misfires to\nissue occasionally in false cognitions (e.g. perceptual illusions,\nbeliefs resulting from a reporting error, etc.). The Manual of\nReason\u2019s example (TS 72) is of the false pseudo-perceptual\njudgement \u201cThis is a piece of silver\u201d on seeing an\noyster-shell. I will discuss the epistemology of perception, inference\nand testimony in \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 and 9 respectively. Here, I will\nexamine in more detail three types of cognition which, though very\nimportant within the Ny\u0101ya framework, are subsidiary to its\nepistemology. They are: memory, \u2018doubt\u2019 and\ntarka. (Where do dreams fit in the schema? TS 70 states that\nthey belong in the category of \u2018false\u2019 cognitions. This,\nhowever, is odd, since they are not the product of any of the four\npram\u0101\u1e47as misfiring. Neither are they memories or\nstates of doubt. According to Pra\u015bastap\u0101da, dreams are the\nresult of the free movement of the \u2018mind\u2019 when it is not\nconnected with the external sense-faculties, influenced by\nad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, \u2018unseen\u2019 forces.)\n",
