    "main_text": "The Explosive Growth of AI || The Resurgence of Probabilistic Techniques\n4.3 The Resurgence of Probabilistic Techniques\n\nThere is a second dimension to the explosive growth of AI: the\nexplosion in popularity of probabilistic methods that aren\u2019t\nneurocomputational in nature, in order to formalize and mechanize a\nform of non-logicist reasoning in the face of uncertainty.\nInterestingly enough, it is Eugene Charniak himself who can be safely\nconsidered one of the leading proponents of an explicit, premeditated\nturn away from logic to statistical techniques. His area of\nspecialization is natural language processing, and whereas his\nintroductory textbook of 1985 gave an accurate sense of his approach\nto parsing at the time (as we have seen, write computer programs that,\ngiven English text as input, ultimately infer meaning expressed in\nFOL), this approach was abandoned in favor of purely statistical\napproaches (Charniak 1993). At the\n AI@50\n conference, Charniak boldly proclaimed, in a talk tellingly entitled\n\u201cWhy Natural Language Processing is Now Statistical Natural\nLanguage Processing,\u201d that logicist AI is moribund, and that the\nstatistical approach is the only promising game in town \u2013 for\nthe next 50\n years.[34]\n\nThe chief source of energy and debate at the conference flowed from\nthe clash between Charniak\u2019s probabilistic orientation, and the\noriginal logicist orientation, upheld at the conference in question by\nJohn McCarthy and others.\n\nAI\u2019s use of probability theory grows out of the standard form of\nthis theory, which grew directly out of technical philosophy and\nlogic. This form will be familiar to many philosophers, but\nlet\u2019s review it quickly now, in order to set a firm stage for\nmaking points about the new probabilistic techniques that have\nenergized AI. \n\nJust as in the case of FOL, in probability theory we are concerned\nwith declarative statements, or propositions, to which degrees\nof belief are applied; we can thus say that both logicist and\nprobabilistic approaches are symbolic in nature. Both approaches also\nagree that statements can either be true or false in the world. In\nbuilding agents, a simplistic logic-based approach requires agents to\nknow the truth-value of all possible statements. This is not\nrealistic, as an agent may not know the truth-value of some\nproposition \\(p\\) due to either ignorance, non-determinism in the\nphysical world, or just plain vagueness in the meaning of the\nstatement. More specifically, the fundamental proposition in\nprobability theory is a random variable, which can be conceived\nof as an aspect of the world whose status is initially unknown to the\nagent. We usually capitalize the names of random variables, though we\nreserve \\(p,q,r, \\ldots\\) as such names as well. For example, in a\nparticular murder investigation centered on whether or not Mr. Barolo\ncommitted the crime, the random variable \\(Guilty\\) might be of\nconcern. The detective may be interested as well in whether or not the\nmurder weapon \u2013 a particular knife, let us assume \u2013\nbelongs to Barolo. In light of this, we might say that \\(\\Weapon =\n\\true\\) if it does, and \\(\\Weapon = \\false\\) if it doesn\u2019t. As a\nnotational convenience, we can write \\(weapon\\) and \\(\\lnot weapon\\)\nand for these two cases, respectively; and we can use this convention\nfor other variables of this type. \n\nThe kind of variables we have described so far are\n\\(\\mathbf{Boolean}\\), because their \\(\\mathbf{domain}\\) is simply\n\\(\\{true,false\\}.\\) But we can generalize and allow\n\\(\\mathbf{discrete}\\) random variables, whose values are from any\ncountable domain. For example, \\(\\PriceTChina\\) might be a variable\nfor the price of (a particular, presumably) tea in China, and its\ndomain might be \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\), where each number here is in US\ndollars. A third type of variable is \\(\\mathbf{continous}\\); its\ndomain is either the reals, or some subset thereof. \n\nWe say that an atomic event is an assignment of particular\nvalues from the appropriate domains to all the variables composing the\n(idealized) world. For example, in the simple murder investigation\nworld introduced just above, we have two Boolean variables,\n\\(\\Guilty\\) and \\(\\Weapon\\), and there are just four atomic events.\nNote that atomic events have some obvious properties. For example,\nthey are mutually exclusive, exhaustive, and logically entail the\ntruth or falsity of every proposition. Usually not obvious to\nbeginning students is a fourth property, namely, any proposition is\nlogically equivalent to the disjunction of all atomic events that\nentail that proposition. \n\nPrior probabilities correspond to a degree of belief accorded to a\nproposition in the complete absence of any other information. For\nexample, if the prior probability of Barolo\u2019s guilt is \\(0.2\\),\nwe write \n\n    \\[\n    P\\left(\\Guilty=true\\right)=0.2\n    \\]\n\n \n\nor simply \\(\\P(guilty)=0.2\\). It is often convenient to have a\nnotation allowing one to refer economically to the probabilities of\nall the possible values for a random variable. For example,\nwe can write \n\n    \\[\n    \\P\\left(\\PriceTChina\\right)\n    \\]\n\n \n\nas an abbreviation for the five equations listing all the possible\nprices for tea in China. We can also write \n\n    \\[\n    \\P\\left(\\PriceTChina\\right)=\\langle 1,2,3,4,5\\rangle\n    \\]\n\n \n\nIn addition, as further convenient notation, we can write \\(\n\\mathbf{P}\\left(\\Guilty, \\Weapon\\right)\\) to denote the probabilities\nof all combinations of values of the relevant set of random variables.\nThis is referred to as the joint probability distribution of\n\\(\\Guilty\\) and \\(\\Weapon\\). The full joint probability\ndistribution covers the distribution for all the random variables used\nto describe a world. Given our simple murder world, we have 20 atomic\nevents summed up in the equation \n\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{P}\\left(\\Guilty, \\Weapon, \\PriceTChina\\right)\n    \\]\n\n \n\nThe final piece of the basic language of probability theory\ncorresponds to conditional probabilities. Where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)\nare any propositions, the relevant expression is \\(P\\!\\left(p\\given\nq\\right)\\), which can be interpreted as \u201cthe probability of\n\\(p\\), given that all we know is \\(q\\).\u201d For example,\n\n    \\[\n    P\\left(guilty\\ggiven weapon\\right)=0.7\n    \\]\n\n \n\nsays that if the murder weapon belongs to Barolo, and no other\ninformation is available, the probability that Barolo is guilty is\n\\(0.7.\\) \n\nAndrei Kolmogorov showed how to construct probability theory from\nthree axioms that make use of the machinery now introduced, viz., \n\n All probabilities fall between \\(0\\) and \\(1.\\) I.e., \\(\\forall\np. 0 \\leq P(p) \\leq 1\\). \n Valid (in the traditional logicist sense) propositions have a\nprobability of \\(1\\); unsatisfiable (in the traditional logicist\nsense) propositions have a probability of \\(0\\). \n \\(P(p\\lor q) = P(p) +P(q) - P(p\\land q)\\) \n\n\nThese axioms are clearly at bottom logicist. The remainder of\nprobability theory can be erected from this foundation (conditional\nprobabilities are easily defined in terms of prior probabilities). We\ncan thus say that logic is in some fundamental sense still being used\nto characterize the set of beliefs that a rational agent can have. But\nwhere does probabilistic inference enter the picture on this\naccount, since traditional deduction is not used for inference in\nprobability theory?\n\nProbabilistic inference consists in computing, from observed evidence\nexpressed in terms of probability theory, posterior probabilities of\npropositions of interest. For a good long while, there have been\nalgorithms for carrying out such computation. These algorithms precede\nthe resurgence of probabilistic techniques in the 1990s. (Chapter 13\nof AIMA presents a number of them.) For example, given the\nKolmogorov axioms, here is a straightforward way of computing the\nprobability of any proposition, using the full joint distribution\ngiving the probabilities of all atomic events: Where \\(p\\) is some\nproposition, let \\(\\alpha(p)\\) be the disjunction of all atomic events\nin which \\(p\\) holds. Since the probability of a proposition (i.e.,\n\\(P(p)\\)) is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the atomic\nevents in which it holds, we have an equation that provides a method\nfor computing the probability of any proposition \\(p\\), viz., \n\n\\[\n P(p) = \\sum_{e_i\\in\\alpha(p)} P(e_i)\n\\]\n\n\nUnfortunately, there were two serious problems infecting this original\nprobabilistic approach: One, the processing in question needed to take\nplace over paralyzingly large amounts of information (enumeration over\nthe entire distribution is required). And two, the expressivity of the\napproach was merely propositional. (It was by the way the philosopher\nHilary Putnam (1963) who pointed out that there was a price to pay in\nmoving to the first-order level. The issue is not discussed herein.)\nEverything changed with the advent of a new formalism that marks the\nmarriage of probabilism and graph theory: Bayesian networks\n(also called belief nets). The pivotal text was (Pearl 1988).\nFor a more detailed discussion, see the\n\nSupplement on Bayesian Networks.\n \n\nBefore concluding this section, it is probably worth noting that, from\nthe standpoint of philosophy, a situation such as the murder\ninvestigation we have exploited above would often be analyzed into\narguments, and strength factors, not into numbers to be\ncrunched by purely arithmetical procedures. For example, in the\nepistemology of Roderick Chisholm, as presented his Theory of\nKnowledge (1966, 1977), Detective Holmes might classify a\nproposition like  Barolo committed the murder. as\ncounterbalanced if he was unable to find a compelling argument\neither way, or perhaps probable if the murder weapon turned out\nto belong to Barolo. Such categories cannot be found on a continuum\nfrom 0 to 1, and they are used in articulating arguments for or\nagainst Barolo\u2019s guilt. Argument-based approaches to uncertain\nand defeasible reasoning are virtually non-existent in AI. One\nexception is Pollock\u2019s approach, covered below. This approach is\nChisholmian in nature. \n\nIt should also be noted that there have been well-established\nformalisms for dealing with probabilistic reasoning as an instance of\nlogic-based reasoning. E.g., the activity a researcher in\nprobabilistic reasoning undertakes when she proves a theorem \\(\\phi\\)\nabout their domain (e.g. any theorem in (Pearl 1988)) is purely within\nthe realm of traditional logic. Readers interested in logic-flavored\napproaches to probabilistic reasoning can consult (Adams 1996,\nHailperin 1996 & 2010, Halpern 1998). Formalisms marrying\nprobability theory, induction and deductive reasoning, placing them on\nan equal footing, have been on the rise, with Markov logic (Richardson\nand Domingos 2006) being salient among these approaches. \n\nProbabilistic Machine Learning\n\nMachine learning, in the sense given\n above,\n has been associated with probabilistic techniques. Probabilistic\ntechniques have been associated with both the learning of functions\n(e.g. Naive Bayes classification) and the modeling of theoretical\nproperties of learning algorithms. For example, a standard\nreformulation of supervised learning casts it as a Bayesian\nproblem. Assume that we are looking at recognizing digits\n\\([0{-}9]\\) from a given image. One way to cast this problem is to ask\nwhat the probability that the hypothesis \\(H_x\\): \u201cthe digit\nis \\(x\\)\u201d is true given the image \\(d\\) from a sensor. Bayes\ntheorem gives us:  \n\n\\[\n P\\left(H_x\\ggiven  d\\right) = \\frac{P\\left(d\\ggiven  H_x\\right)*P\\left(H_x\\right)}{P\\left(d\\right)}\n\\]\n\n\n\\(P(d\\given H_x)\\) and \\(P(H_x)\\) can be estimated from the given\ntraining dataset. Then the hypothesis with the highest posterior\nprobability is then given as the answer and is given by:\n\\(\\argmax_{x}P\\left(d\\ggiven H_x\\right)*P\\left(H_x\\right) \\) In\naddition to probabilistic methods being used to build algorithms,\nprobability theory has also been used to analyze algorithms which\nmight not have an overt probabilistic or logical formulation. For\nexample, one of the central classes of meta-theorems in learning,\nprobably approximately correct (PAC) theorems, are cast in\nterms of lower bounds of the probability that the mismatch between the\ninduced/learnt fL function and the true function\nfT being less than a certain amount, given that the\nlearnt function fL works well for a certain number\nof cases (see Chapter 18, AIMA). \n",
