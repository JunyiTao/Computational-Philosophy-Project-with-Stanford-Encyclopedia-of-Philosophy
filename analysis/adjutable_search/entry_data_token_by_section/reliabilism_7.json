So Roxanne often looks at the gauge and arrives at\nconjunctive beliefs like the following: On this occasion the gauge\nreads \u201cFull\u201d & the tank is full. Now, the\nperceptual process by which she arrives at the belief that the gauge\nreads \u201cFull\u201d is reliable, and so is the process by which\nshe arrives at the belief that the tank is full (given that the gauge\nfunctions reliably). According to reliabilism, therefore, her belief\nin the indicated conjunction should be justified. Now Roxanne deduces\nthe proposition, On this occasion, the gauge is reporting\naccurately. From multiple instances of this reasoning, she\ninduces the further conclusion: The gauge is generally\nreliable. Finally, with a little more deduction she concludes she\nis justified in believing that her gas tank is full. Since\ndeduction and induction are reliable processes, Roxanne must also be\njustified in believing that her gas gauge is full. But is this verdict\nplausible? Definitely not, says Vogel, because such bootstrapping\namounts to a vicious form of epistemic circularity.\n\nIn response to this problem, we should start by noting that this\nproblem is not specific to reliabilism (Cohen 2002). Indeed, the\nproblem arises for all theories that allow for \u201cbasic\njustification\u201d\u2014that is, justification that is obtained via\nsome process or method X without antecedent justification for\nbelieving that X is reliable. As van Cleve (2003) forcefully\nargues, theories that do not allow for basic justification seem to\nlead to wide-ranging skepticism.\n\nIf we wish to allow for basic justification, can we still give a\nprincipled explanation of why some forms of bootstrapping seem\nillegitimate (for example, the case of Roxanne)? This is an area of\nactive research. One suggestion is that illegitimate forms of\nbootstrapping involve No Lose Investigations. Roughly, a No\nLose Investigation into a hypothesis \\(h\\) is an investigation that\ncould never, in principle, count against \\(h\\). (For suggestions along\nthese lines, see Kornblith 2009; Titelbaum 2010; Douven & Kelp\n2013.) Another suggestion is that illegitimate forms of bootstrapping\nall involve epistemic feedback (Weisberg 2010). Suppose an\nagent believes premises \\(p_1\\) \u2026 \\(p_n\\) from which she infers\nlemmas \\(l_1\\) \u2026 \\(l_n\\), from which she in turn infers a\nconclusion \\(c\\). Epistemic feedback is present when the probability\nof \\(c\\) conditional on \\(l_1\\) \u2026 \\(l_n\\) is greater than the\nprobability of \\(c\\) conditional on \\(p_1\\) \u2026 \\(p_n\\).\nRoxanne\u2019s case can be understood in these terms. She first\nbelieves various premises about the gas gauge readings (e.g., The\ngas gauge read full at time \\(t\\); the gauge reads half-empty at\n\\(t^*\\)). She then infers various lemmas about the state of the\ngas tank (e.g., The tank was full at \\(t\\); the tank was\nhalf-empty at \\(t^*\\)). Finally, by conjoining these premises with\nthese lemmas, she comes to believe the conclusion: The gas tank is\nreliable. The probability of this conclusion conditional on just\nthe lemmas (that is, the beliefs about the state of the gas tank) is\nhigher than the probability of the conclusion conditional on the\npremises (that is, the gas gauge readings). Perhaps by imposing a ban\non either No Lose Investigations or epistemic feedback (or both), we\ncan account for the intuition about Roxanne, while still allowing for\nbasic justification. (For an overview of various responses to the\nbootstrapping problem, see Weisberg 2012.)\nThe Problem of Defeat\n\nAnother challenge for reliabilism comes from the phenomenon of\nepistemic defeat. Consider a case where an agent reliably forms a\nbelief that \\(p\\) at some initial time, and later receives some\nevidence (perhaps misleading evidence) indicating that \\(p\\) is false.\nFor example, suppose Alice looks at a red vase in good lighting\nconditions, and forms the belief that the vase is red. A friend comes\nalong and tells her that she is actually looking at a white vase\nilluminated by red lights. It seems that the receipt of this testimony\nrenders her belief unjustified, even though it was originally formed\nvia a reliable process. Can reliabilists accommodate this verdict?\n\nIn \u201cWhat is Justified Belief?\u201d, Goldman acknowledged this\nsort of problem, and suggested adding a \u201cNo Defeaters\u201d\ncondition to the theory of epistemic justification. There, he\nelucidated an account of defeat in counterfactual terms. Roughly, your\nbelief B is defeated provided there is some reliable (or\nconditionally reliable) process X available to you such that,\nif you were you use X, you would no longer hold B. On\nthis view, Alice\u2019s belief is defeated because if she were to use\nthe process believing her friend\u2019s testimony, she would\nnot have believed B. However, this account of defeat has been\nsubject to various challenges. For example, Beddor (2015) argues that\nit commits a version of the \u201ccounterfactual fallacy\u201d,\nrendering it susceptible to counterexamples. And both Lyons (2009:\n124) and Beddor (2021) point out that it has trouble accommodating\ncases where one defeater is defeated by another.\n\nBut even if we reject an account of defeat along these lines, the\nreliabilist may have other options for dealing with the problem. For\nexample, some might suggest that we can handle this problem by\nappropriately typing the agent\u2019s belief. Perhaps after Alice\nreceives her friend\u2019s testimony, her belief is no longer the\nresult of vision alone, but rather of vision while\ndisregarding testimony that vision is unreliable. (See Constantin\n2020; Nagel 2021 for versions of this response.) An important question\nfor this response is whether it is consistent with our most promising\ntheories of process-typing; in this regard, the problem of defeat is\nconnected to the generality problem. Another strategy for handling\ndefeat is to modify reliabilism by incorporating some evidentialist\nelements into the theory. For now, we will defer a more detailed\ndiscussion of this maneuver to\n \u00a74.2\n below.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the reliabilist\u2019s treatment of\ndefeat may bear on other problems facing reliabilism. Consider again\nthe clairvoyance objection. Yet another response to this objection,\nsuggested briefly by Goldman (1986: 112) is that Norman\u2019s belief\nis prima facie justified, but it is defeated. Whether this\nresponse is viable will depend on the details of the\nreliabilist\u2019s theory of defeat.\nThe Temporality Problem\n\nA more recent challenge to reliabilism, due to Frise (2018), is the\n\u201ctemporality problem\u201d. Reliabilists maintain that the\njustificatory status of a belief depends on the reliability of the\nprocess responsible for that belief. But, Frise points out, a process\ncan be more reliable at one time than at another. To give one of\nFrise\u2019s examples, weather forecasting has improved over time. So\nthe process type, forming a belief based on the forecast is\nmore reliable now than it was twenty years ago. This raises a question\nabout the temporal parameters that we should use when evaluating\nreliability. Suppose we are evaluating whether a belief B is\njustified at a time t. Do we restrict our attention to whether\nthe belief-forming process responsible for B is reliable at\nt? Or do we look at whether it has been reliable at all times\nup until t? Or all times that are temporally close to t?\nOr something else?\n\nThis issue has not received much attention from reliabilists, though\nsee Tolly (2019) for an exception. One question that merits further\ninvestigation is whether the reliabilist\u2019s preferred solution to\nthe generality problem will generalize to help with the temporality\nproblem. For example, according to the \u201ccommon sense\u201d\napproach described above, there is considerable convergence in\nordinary people\u2019s judgments about how to type belief-forming\nprocesses. If this is right, is there also convergence in ordinary\npeople\u2019s judgments about which times are relevant to assessing\nthe reliability of a given process? If so, could we use this common\nsense consensus to make progress on the temporality problem?\n",
