    "main_text": "Evil-Skepticism Versus Evil-Revivalism || Evil and Explanatory Power\n1.2 Evil and Explanatory Power\n\nSome evil-skeptics argue that we should abandon the concept of evil\nbecause it lacks explanatory power and therefore is a useless concept\n(see, e.g., Clendinnen 1999, 79\u2013113; Cole 2006, 2019;\nBaron-Cohen 2011). The concept of evil would have explanatory power,\nor be explanatorily useful, if it were able to explain why certain\nactions were performed or why these actions were performed by certain\nagents rather than by others. Evil-skeptics such as Inga Clendinnen\nand Philip Cole argue that the concept of evil cannot provide\nexplanations of this sort and thus should be abandoned.\n\nAccording to Clendinnen the concept of evil cannot explain the\nperformance of actions because it is an essentially dismissive\nclassification. To say that a person, or an action, is evil is just to\nsay that that person, or action, defies explanation or is\nincomprehensible (see Clendinnen 1999, 81; Baron-Cohen 2011, 5-7; see\nalso, Pocock 1985). (Joel Feinberg (2003) also believes that evil\nactions are essentially incomprehensible. But he does not think that\nwe should abandon the concept of evil for this reason.)\n\nSimilarly, Cole believes that the concept of evil is often employed\nwhen we lack a complete explanation for why an action was performed.\nFor instance, we might wonder why two ten-year-old boys, Robert\nThompson and Jon Venerables, tortured and murdered two-year-old James\nBulger while other ten-year-old boys with similar genetic\ncharacteristics and upbringings cause little harm? Cole believes that\nthe concept of evil is employed in these cases to provide the missing\nexplanation. However, Cole argues that the concept of evil does not\nprovide a genuine explanation in these cases because to say that an\naction is evil is just to say either that the action resulted from\nsupernatural forces or that the action is a mystery. To say that an\nevent resulted from supernatural forces is not to give a genuine\nexplanation of the event because these forces do not exist. To say\nthat an event is a mystery is not to give a genuine explanation of an\nevent, but rather, it is to suggest that the event cannot be explained\n(at least with the information currently available) (2006,\n6\u20139).\n\nEvil-revivalists have offered several responses to the objection that\nthe concept of evil should be abandoned because it is explanatorily\nuseless. One common response is that the concept of evil might be\nworth keeping for descriptive or prescriptive purposes even if it\nisn\u2019t explanatorily useful (Garrard 2002, 323\u2013325; Russell\n2009, 268\u2013269).\n\nAnother common response is to argue that evil is no less explanatorily\nuseful than other moral concepts such as good, bad, right, and wrong\n(Garrard 2002, 322\u2013326; Russell 2009, 268\u2013269). Thus, if\nwe should abandon the concept of evil we should abandon these other\nmoral concepts as well.\n\nEve Garrard and Luke Russell also point out that even if the concept\nof evil cannot provide a complete explanation for the performance of\nan action, it can provide a partial explanation. For instance, Garrard\nargues that evil actions result from a particular kind of motivation.\nCall this an E-motivation. Thus, to say that an action is evil is to\nsay that it has resulted from an E-motivation. This provides a partial\nexplanation for why the action was performed. Furthermore, Garrard has\nargued that if evil actions result from particularly unsavory\nmotivational states then the concept of evil is able to explain why we\nreact with horror in the face of evil actions.  That is, we react with\nhorror in the face of evil actions because they result from\nparticularly despicable motivational states (Garrard 2019, 197. See\nalso, de Wijze 2019, 212). \n",
