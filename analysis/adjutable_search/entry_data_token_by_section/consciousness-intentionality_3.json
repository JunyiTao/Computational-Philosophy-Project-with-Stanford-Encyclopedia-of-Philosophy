Intentionality and the Analytic Heritage\n\nThe late nineteenth/early twentieth century heritage of most analytic\ntreatments of intentionality (or mental representation or content)\nlies most significantly not in the writings of Brentano, Husserl and\ntheir direct intellectual descendants, but in the seminal discussions\nof logico-linguistic concerns in Gottlob Frege\u2019s ([1892] 1952)\n\u201cOn Sense and Reference\u201d, and Bertrand Russell\u2019s\n(1905) \u201cOn Denoting\u201d, widely considered defining documents\nof the analytic tradition. But Frege\u2019s and Russell\u2019s work\ncomes from much the same era and intellectual milieu as\nBrentano\u2019s and the early Husserl\u2019s. And certain points of\ncontact have long been recognized: Russell\u2019s discussion of\nMeinong\u2019s theory of objects; Chisholm\u2019s and Quine\u2019s\ndiscussion of what they took to be \u201cBrentano\u2019s\nthesis\u201d; and the similarities between Husserl\u2019s\nmeaning/object distinction (in Logical Investigation I) and\nFrege\u2019s (prior) sense/reference distinction. Indeed the case has\nbeen influentially (though controversially) made (by F\u00f8llesdal\n1969, 1990) that Husserl\u2019s meaning/object distinction is\nborrowed from Frege (though with a change in terminology) and that\nHusserl\u2019s \u201cnoema\u201d is properly interpreted as having\nthe characteristics of Fregean sense.\n\nHowever, in comparing phenomenological treatments of intentionality to\nthose found in the analytic tradition the following should be kept in\nmind. What Husserl (like Brentano) sought was to characterize general\nfeatures of intentional experience from the subject\u2019s point of\nview. Accordingly, his conception of intentionality is fundamentally\nrooted in reflections on: object-constancy in perceptual experience;\ncontrasts between the ostensible objects of paradigm intentional\nexperiences with these objects \u201cas intended\u201d (i.e., how\nand \u201cas what\u201d they are intended); and the idea that\nexperience (whether perceptual, imaginative, or conceptual) can\nsomehow continue to be \u201cof\u201d something, even when it is\nwithout genuine relation to an object. Thus, in the phenomenological\ntradition, the discussion of intentionality is thoroughly enmeshed\nwith that of experience or consciousness from the start. On the other\nhand, those of Frege\u2019s and Russell\u2019s writings most\ninfluential for discussions of intentionality concentrate on issues\nthat grow from their achievements in logic, and gave rise to ways of\nunderstanding mental states largely through questions about the\nlanguage used to report them. Moreover, for other reasons, during much\nof the twentieth century, analytic philosophy often dissociated\nconsciousness (understood largely or entirely in sensory terms) from\naspects of the mind connected with intentionality. Thus our treatment\nof intentionality in this section will leave the concept of\nconsciousness largely in the background. It will, nonetheless,\nreemerge explicitly in Section 5, when we see how consciousness and\nintentionality were separated, and then reunited in analytic\nphilosophy.\n\nCentral to Frege\u2019s legacy for discussions of mental or\nintentional content has been his distinction between sense\n(Sinn) and reference (Bedeutung), and his use of\nthis distinction to cope with the apparent failures of substitutivity\nof (ordinarily) co-referential expressions in contexts created by\npsychological verbs, of the sort mentioned in Section 2. In\nFrege\u2019s famous example: you may understand the expressions\n\u201cThe Morning Star\u201d and \u201cThe Evening Star\u201d and\nuse them to refer to what is one and the same object\u2014the planet\nVenus. But this is not sufficient for you to know that the Morning\nStar is identical with the Evening Star. For the ways in which an\nobject (the \u201creference\u201d) is \u201cgiven\u201d to your\nmind when you employ these expressions (the senses or Sinne\nyou grasp when you use them) may differ in such a manner that\nignorance of astronomy would prevent your realizing that they are but\ntwo ways in which the same object can be given.\n\nWhile Frege did not himself elaborate a general account of\nintentionality, what he says suggests the following picture.\nIntentional states of mind\u2014thinking about Venus, wishing to\nvisit it\u2014involve some special relation (such as\n\u201cgrasping\u201d)\u2014not to a Venus \u201cin one\u2019s\nmind\u201d, nor to an image of Venus, but to an abstract entity, a\nthought, which also constitutes the sense of a linguistic expression\nthat can be used to report one\u2019s state of mind, a sense that is\ngrasped or understood by speakers who use it.\n\nThis style of account, together with the Fregean thesis that\n\u201csense determines reference\u201d, and the history of\ncriticisms both have elicited, provide a significant part of the\nbackground of contemporary discussions of mental content. It is often\nassumed, with Frege, that we must recognize that thoughts or contents\ncannot consist in images or essentially private \u201cideas\u201d.\nBut philosophers have frequently criticized Frege\u2019s view of\nthought as some abstract entity \u201cgrasped\u201d or\n\u201cpresent to\u201d the mind, and have wanted to replace\nFrege\u2019s unanalyzed grasping of abstract entities with something\nmore \u201cnaturalistic\u201d, or at any rate more\nexplanatory of what is involved in thinking.\n\nReaction to the Fregean picture has determined the character of\nanalytic discussions of intentionality or content in another major\nway. It may be granted that the content of the thought reported is to\nbe identified with the sense of the expression with which we report\nit. But then, it is argued, the identity of this content will not be\ndetermined individualistically, and may in some respects lie beyond\nthe grasp (or not be fully \u201cpresent to\u201d the mind) of the\npsychological subject. For what determines the reference of an\nexpression may be a natural causal relation to the world\u2014as Saul\nKripke (1972) and Hilary Putnam (1975) have argued is true for proper\nnames, like \u201cNixon\u201d and \u201cCicero\u201d, and\n\u201cnatural kind\u201d terms like \u201cgold\u201d and\n\u201cwater\u201d. And (as Tyler Burge (1979) has argued) a speaker\nwho, considered individually, remains qualitatively the same, may\nnevertheless assert something different simply because of a variation\nin the linguistic community to which she belongs. (For example, what\nher utterance of \u201carthritis\u201d means is determined not by\nwhat is \u201cin her head\u201d, but by the medical experts in her\ncommunity. If their usage were to shift, so would the meaning of her\nassertions, independently of any internal change in her.) Now if\nreference and truth conditions of expressions by which one\u2019s\nthought is reported or expressed are not determined by what is in\none\u2019s head, and the content of one\u2019s thought determines\ntheir reference and truth conditions, then the content of one\u2019s\nthought is also not determined individualistically. Rather it is\nnecessarily bound up with one\u2019s causal relations to certain\nnatural substances, and one\u2019s membership in a certain linguistic\ncommunity. Both linguistic meaning and mental contents are\n\u201cexternally\u201d determined.\n\nThe development of externalist conceptions of intentionality informs\nthe reception of Russell\u2019s legacy in contemporary philosophy of\nmind as well. Russell also helped to put in play a conception of the\nintentionality of mental states, according to which each such state is\nseen as involving the individual\u2019s \u201cacquaintance with a\nproposition\u201d (counterpart to Fregean\n\u201cgrasping\u201d)\u2014which proposition is at once both what\nis understood in understanding expressions by which the state of mind\nis reported, and the content of the individual\u2019s state of mind.\nThus for many philosophers influenced by the Russellian heritage,\nintentional states are conceived of as attitudes towards\npropositions\u2014propositional attitudes. Also importantly,\nRussell\u2019s famous analysis of definite descriptions into phrases\nemploying existential quantifiers and predicates underlay many\nsubsequent philosophers\u2019 rejection of any conception of\nintentionality (like Meinong\u2019s) that sees in it a relation to\nnon-existent objects. And, Russell\u2019s treatment drew attention to\ncases of what he called \u201clogically proper names\u201d that\napparently defy such analysis in descriptive terms (paradigmatically,\nthe terms \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d), and which (he\nthought) thus must refer directly to objects. Reflection on such\n\u201cdemonstrative\u201d and \u201cindexical\u201d (e.g.,\n\u201cI\u201d, \u201chere\u201d, \u201cnow\u201d) reference led\nsome (Kaplan 1979; Perry 1977) to maintain that the content of our\nstates of mind cannot always be constituted by Fregean senses but must\nbe seen as consisting partly of public objects in the world outside\nour heads to which we refer, demonstratively,\nindexically\u2014another source of support for an externalist view of\nmental content, hence, of intentionality.\n\nYet another important source of externalist proclivities in twentieth\ncentury philosophy lies in the thought that the meaningfulness of a\nspeaker\u2019s utterances depends on its potential intelligibility to\nhearers: language must be public\u2014an idea that has found\nvarying and influential expression in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein,\nW.V.O. Quine, and Donald Davidson. This, coupled with the assumption\nthat intentionality (or \u201cthought\u201d in the broad (Cartesian)\nsense) must be expressible in language, has led some to conclude that\nwhat determines the content of one\u2019s mind must lie in the\nexternal conditions that enable others to attribute that content.\n\nIt would be appropriate here to note the emergence of another sort of\nexternalism in philosophy of mind and cognitive science since the\n1990s, distinct from the \u201ccontent externalism\u201d made\nprominent by Putnam and Burge, as strains of \u201cembodied\u201d,\n\u201cembedded\u201d, or \u201cenactive\u201d, theorizing about\nperception, cognition and action gained prominence. For instance, on\nthe \u201cextended mind\u201d view advocated in Clark and Chalmers\n1998, mental processes are not confined to representational activity\ninside one\u2019s head\u2014they encompass an embodied interaction\nwith one\u2019s environment\u2014cognition (broadly construed) is\nnot limited to the manipulations of internal representations, but\nextends to the use of things out in the world.\n\nIt should be noted here too that the movement from Frege and Russell\ntoward externalist views of intentional content has been, and\ncontinues to be subject to serious detailed challenges, and has\nprompted development of alternative (sometimes avowedly internalist)\naccounts. (Consider, for example: Crane 1991, Farkas 2008, Ludwig\n1996b, and Searle 1983.) And it is no easy matter even getting clear\nabout the fundamental theses at issue\u2014partly insofar as what it\nmeans to talk about what is \u201cinternal\u201d to the subject, and\njust what is assumed about the notion of content, are often unclear.\nIn fact, Brie Gertler (2012b) argues that the\n\u201cinternalism/externalism debate\u201d is something of a mess,\nand there is ultimately no satisfactory univocal understanding of just\nwhat is under dispute.\n\nOne other aspect of the Frege-Russell tradition of theorizing about\ncontent that impinges on the consciousness/intentionality connection\nis this. If content is identified with the sense or the\ntruth-condition determiners of the expressions used in the\nobject-clause reporting intentional states of mind, it will seem\nnatural (even if it\u2019s not inevitable) to suppose that possession\nof mental content requires the possession of conceptual capacities of\nthe sort involved in linguistic understanding\u2014\u201cgrasping\nsenses\u201d. Here, however, another issue rears its head: is there\nnot perhaps a form of sensory intentionality that does not\nrequire anything as distinctively intellectual or conceptual as is\nneeded for the grasping of linguistic senses or propositions? (This\nwould be a kind of intentionality that could be had by the\npre-linguistic (e.g., babies) or by non-linguistic creatures (e.g.,\ndogs).) Advocates of varying versions of the idea that there is a\ndistinctively \u201cnon-conceptual\u201d kind of content include\nBerm\u00fadez (1998), Crane (1992), Evans (1982), Kelly (2001),\nPeacocke (1992), and Tye (1995). For \u201cconceptualist\u201d\nvoices of opposition to this trend, see Brewer (2005), McDowell\n(1994), and Speaks (2005). A deep difficulty in assessing these\ndebates lies in getting an acceptable conception of concepts\n(and of concept possession) to work with (see Wright 2015).\n\nWe can now see, in the analytic tradition, the emergence of themes\nsimilar to the \u201cdetachability\u201d and \u201cbasic\nforms\u201d themes identified in the connection with the\nphenomenological movement. Later we will discuss these parallels. For\nnow, to round out the present historical sketch so as to inform such\ncomparisons, we may note some of the factors seemingly important to\nthe course discussion took in analytic philosophy. Though its approach\nto intentionality is historically rooted in Fregean and Russellian\ntreatments of logic and language, developments during the twentieth\ncentury sketched above\u2014various forms of externalism, along with\nopposition to allegedly over-intellectualized views of perceptual\nintentionality\u2014came in conflict with this heritage to some\nextent. Among the sources of this shift, one might plausibly find: a\ndisenchantment with early twentieth century conceptions of\nphilosophy\u2019s distinctive role (of, e.g., providing conceptual\nanalyses, and solutions to logico-linguistic puzzles); aligned with\nthis, an increasingly perceived need to support claims in philosophy\nwith experimental science, especially as systematic, academic\npsychology grew more sophisticated and successful; and\nfinally\u2014relatedly\u2014the belief that defending a scientific\nworldview requires defending an ontology typically described as\n\u201cphysicalist\u201d against objections deemed to have\nunacceptably dualist implications. Such factors (and others) helped\nencourage philosophers in the analytic tradition to tie consciousness\nmore closely to intentionality in ways that raised issues similar to\nthose canvassed above in connection with phenomenology\u2014though\noften from rather different motives.\n",
