    "main_text": "Philosophical Influences || Ethics: Kant and Nietzsche\n2.2 Ethics: Kant and Nietzsche\n\nGerman Idealism seems to have exerted another enduring influence on\nWeber, discernible in his ethical worldview more than in his\nepistemological position. This was the strand of Idealist discourse in\nwhich a broadly Kantian ethic and its Nietzschean interlocution figure\nprominently.\n\nThe way in which Weber understood Kant seems to have come through the\nconceptual template set by moral psychology and philosophical\nanthropology. In conscious opposition to the utilitarian-naturalistic\njustification of modern individualism, Kant viewed moral action as\nprincipled and self-disciplined while expressive of genuine freedom\nand autonomy. On this Kantian view, freedom and autonomy are to be\nfound in the instrumental control of the self and the world\n(objectification) according to a law formulated solely from within\n(subjectification). Furthermore, such a paradoxical compound is made\npossible by an internalization or willful acceptance of a\ntranscendental rational principle, which saves it from falling prey to\nthe hedonistic subjectification that Kant found in Enlightenment\nnaturalism and which he so detested. Kant in this regard follows\nRousseau in condemning utilitarianism; instrumental-rational control\nof the world in the service of our desires and needs just degenerates\ninto organized egoism. In order to prevent it, mere freedom of choice\nbased on elective will (Willk\u00fcr) has to be replaced by\nthe exercise of purely rational will (Wille) [Taylor 1989,\n364]. The so-called \u201cinward turn\u201d is thus the crucial\nbenchmark of autonomous moral agency for Kant, but its basis has been\nfundamentally altered; it should be done with the purpose of serving a\nhigher end, that is, the universal law of reason. A willful\nself-transformation is demanded now in the service of a higher law\nbased on reason, or an \u201cultimate value\u201d in Weber\u2019s\nparlance.\n\nWeber\u2019s understanding of this Kantian ethical template was\nstrongly tinged by the Protestant theological debate taking place in\nthe Germany of his time between (orthodox Lutheran) Albrecht Ritschl\nand Matthias Schneckenburger (of Calvinist persuasion), a context with\nwhich Weber became acquainted through his Heidelberg colleague,\nTroeltsch. Suffice it to note in this connection that Weber\u2019s\nsharp critique of Ritschl\u2019s Lutheran communitarianism seems\nreflective of his broadly Kantian preoccupation with radically\nsubjective individualism and the methodical transformation of the self\n[Graf 1995].\n\nAll in all, one might say that \u201cthe preoccupations of Kant and\nof Weber are really the same. One was a philosopher and the other a\nsociologist, but there\u2026 the difference ends\u201d [Gellner\n1974, 184]. That which also ends, however, is Weber\u2019s\nsubscription to a Kantian ethic of duty when it comes to the\npossibility of a universal law of reason. Weber was keenly aware of\nthe fact that the Kantian linkage between growing self-consciousness,\nthe possibility of universal law, and principled and thus free action\nhad been irrevocably severed. Kant managed to preserve the precarious\nidentification of non-arbitrary action and subjective freedom by\nasserting such a linkage, which Weber believed to be unsustainable in\nhis allegedly Nietzschean age.\n\nAccording to Nietzsche, \u201cwill to truth\u201d cannot be content\nwith the metaphysical construction of a grand metanarrative, whether\nit be monotheistic religion or modern science, and growing\nself-consciousness, or \u201cintellectualization\u201d \u00e0 la\nWeber, can lead only to a radical skepticism, value relativism, or,\neven worse, nihilism. According to such a Historicist diagnosis of\nmodernity that culminates in the \u201cdeath of God,\u201d the\nalternative seems to be either a radical self-assertion and\nself-creation that runs the risk of being arbitrary (as in Nietzsche)\nor a complete desertion of the modern ideal of self-autonomous freedom\n(as in early Foucault). If the first approach leads to a radical\ndivinization of humanity, one possible extension of modern humanism,\nthe second leads inexorably to a \u201cdedivinization\u201d of\nhumanity, a postmodern antihumanism [Vattimo 1988, 31\u201347].\n\nSeen in this light, Weber\u2019s ethical sensibility is built on a\nfirm rejection of a Nietzschean divination and Foucaultian resignation\nalike, both of which are radically at odds with the Kantian ethic of\nduty. In other words, Weber\u2019s ethical project can be described\nas a search for non-arbitrary freedom (his Kantian side) in what he\nperceived as an increasingly post-metaphysical world (his Nietzschean\nside). According to Paul Honigsheim, Weber\u2019s ethic is that of\n\u201ctragedy\u201d and \u201cnevertheless\u201d [Honigsheim 2013,\n113]. This deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a\nNietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what\ngives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber\u2019s ethical\nworldview.\n",
