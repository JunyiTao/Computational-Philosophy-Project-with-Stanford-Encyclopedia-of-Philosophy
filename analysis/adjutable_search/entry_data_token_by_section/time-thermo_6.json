    "main_text": "The Problem of the Direction of Time II\n3. The Problem of the Direction of Time II\n\nLife is filled with temporal asymmetries. This directedness is one of\nthe most general features of the world we inhabit. We can break this\ngeneral tendency down into a few more specific temporal arrows.\n\nThe epistemological arrow. Roughly put, we know more about the\npast than the future. I know that yesterday\u2019s broken egg on the\nfloor had a similar outline to Chile\u2019s boundaries, but I have no\nidea what country tomorrow\u2019s broken egg will look like. Albert\n(2000) provides a much better characterization, for no one really\ncounts and compares known propositions between past and future.\nIt\u2019s better to say, as he does, that our way of knowing\nthe past is different than our way of knowing the future. There also\nseem to be more traces of events in the future than in the past. When\nI say something embarrassing, information representing that event is\nencoded on sound and light waves that form a continually increasing\nspherical shell in my future light-cone. I am potentially further\nembarrassed throughout my whole future lightcone. Yet there is no\nindication of the unfortunate event in its backward lightcone.\nThe mutability arrow. We feel the future is \u201copen\u201d or\nindeterminate in a way the past is not. The past is closed, fixed for\nall eternity. Related to this, no doubt, is the feeling that our\nactions are essentially tied to the future and not the past. The\nfuture is mutable whereas the past is not.\nThe psychological arrow. We have very different attitudes toward\nthe past than toward the future. We dread future but not past\nheadaches and prison sentences. This controversial arrow is actually\nmany different asymmetries. Another, much disputed, is that we seem to\nshare a psychological sense of passage through time. Allegedly, we\nsense a moving \u201cnow\u201d, the motion of the present as events\nare transformed from future to past.\nThe explanation-causation-counterfactual arrow. This arrow is\nactually three, yet it seems plausible that there are connections\namong them. Causes typically occur before their effects.\nRelated to the causal asymmetry in some fashion or other is the\nasymmetry of explanation. Usually good explanations appeal to events\nin the past of the event to be explained, not to events in the future.\nIt may be that this is just a prejudice that we ought to dispense\nwith, but it is an intuition that we frequently have. Finally, and no\ndoubt this is again related to the other two arrows as well as the\nmutability arrow, we\u2014at least naively\u2014believe the future\ndepends counterfactually on the present in a way that we do not\nbelieve the past depends counterfactually on the present.\n\n\nThe above list is not meant to be exhaustive or especially clean.\nTemporal asymmetries are everywhere. We age and die. Punchlines are at\nthe ends of jokes. Propensities and dispositions and reproductive\nfitness are all future-directed. We prefer rags-to-riches stories to\nriches-to-rags stories. Obviously there are connections amongst many\nof these arrows. Some authors have explicitly or implicitly proposed\nvarious \u201cdependency charts\u201d that are supposed to explain\nwhich of the above arrows depend on which for their existence. Horwich\n(1987) argues for an explanatory relationship wherein the\ncounterfactual arrow depends on the causal arrow, which depends on the\narrow of explanation, which depends on the epistemological arrow.\nLewis (1979), by contrast, thinks an alleged over-determination of\ntraces grounds the asymmetry of counterfactuals and that this in turn\ngrounds the rest. Suhler and Callender (2011) ground the psychological\narrow on the causal and knowledge asymmetries. The chart one judges\nmost appropriate will depend, to a large degree, upon one\u2019s\ngeneral philosophical stance on many large topics.\n\nWhich dependency chart is the correct one is not our concern here.\nRather, the second \u201cproblem of the direction of time\u201d\nasks: do any (all?) of these arrows ultimately hold in virtue of the\nthermodynamic arrow of time (or what grounds it)?\n\nSklar (1985) provides useful examples to have in mind. Consider the\nup-down asymmetry. It plausibly reduces to the local gravitational\ngradient. Astronauts on the moon think down is the direction toward\nthe center of the moon, not wherever it was when they left Earth. By\ncontrast, there is (probably) merely a correlation between the\nleft-right asymmetry (say, in snail shells) and parity violations in\nhigh-energy particle physics. The second problem asks whether any of\nthe above temporal asymmetries are to the thermodynamic arrow as the\nup-down asymmetry is to the local gravitational gradient. Of course,\nwe don\u2019t expect anything quite so straightforward. Sklar\ndescribes an experiment where iron dust inserted in the ear sacs of\nfish cause the fish to swim upside down when a magnet is held over the\ntank, presumably altering their sense of up and down. But as Jos\nUffink remarked to me, going inside a refrigerator doesn\u2019t cause\nus to remember the future. The connections, if any, are bound to be\nsubtle.\n",
