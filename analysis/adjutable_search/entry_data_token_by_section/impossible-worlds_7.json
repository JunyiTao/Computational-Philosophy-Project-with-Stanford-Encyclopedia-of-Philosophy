    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Impossible Worlds\n3. The Metaphysics of Impossible Worlds\n\nSupporters of impossible worlds disagree over their metaphysical\nnature, just as supporters of possible worlds do. If one accepts\nontological commitment to worlds of any kind, then one faces the\nfollow-up question: just what are they, metaphysically speaking?\n\nThe two main options among modal realists (philosophers who\naccept possible worlds in their ontology) are David Lewis\u2019s\nextreme or genuine modal realism and\nersatzism (or actualism or abstractionism:\nthese terms all have slightly different connotations, which\nwe\u2019ll ignore here). It is a common thought among impossible\nworlds theorists that impossible worlds should just inherit the\nontological status of their possible mates: whatever your favorite\nmetaphysics of possible worlds is, impossible worlds are of the same\nkind. This has been called the Parity Thesis (see Rescher and\nBrandom 1980). As Graham Priest puts it:\n\nAs far as I can see, any of the main theories concerning the nature of\npossible worlds can be applied equally to impossible worlds: they are\nexistent nonactual entities; they are nonexistent objects; they are\nconstructions out of properties and other universals; they are just\ncertain sets of sentences. \u2026 There is, as far as I can see,\nabsolutely no cogent (in particular, non-question-begging) reason to\nsuppose that there is an ontological difference between\nmerely possible and impossible worlds. (Priest 1997b: 580\u20131)\n\n\nYagisawa\u2019s extended modal realism proposes a\nLewis-inspired realist account of impossible worlds and\nimpossibilia (the objects exemplifying absolute\nimpossibilities which inhabit impossible worlds). On this view,\nimpossible worlds are concrete mereological sums of real individuals,\nwhich are causally and spatiotemporally interrelated within each world\nbut never across worlds (see Yagisawa 1988). Yagisawa exploits the\n\u201cargument from ways\u201d we met above: if quantification on\nways the world might be or have been commits us to possible worlds,\nthen, by parity of reasoning, quantification on ways the world might\nnot be commits us to impossible worlds. The argument is backed by\nYagisawa\u2019s considerations on the additional logical and\nphilosophical applications allowed by impossible worlds, which are not\navailable, in his view, to traditional Lewisian modal realism.\nExtended modal realism is a strong position: concrete impossible\nworlds represent absolute and logical impossibilities directly, by\ninstantiating them. So impossibilities and, in particular,\nlogical inconsistencies, are \u201cout there\u201d in reality.\n\nIn his 2010 book, Yagisawa is more distant from Lewisian modal\nrealism. He still admits impossible worlds and impossibilia,\nand he rejects ersatz accounts of them. However, he now takes worlds\nto be points in modal space. Worlds are modal indices for truth, just\nlike times are temporal indices for it; and modal matters are treated\nin a way similar to how four-dimensionalist philosophers, who believe\nin\n temporal parts,\n treat temporal matters. According to four-dimensionalists, material\nobjects are like temporal worms extended across time: an object has a\nproperty at time \\(t\\) by having a temporal stage at time \\(t\\) which\nhas that property. Analogously, for Yagisawa an object has a modal\nproperty, a property at world \\(w\\), by having a modal stage at world\n\\(w\\) which has that property.\n\nMore moderate (Yagisawa would say: too moderate) realists\ntreat impossible worlds as ersatz constructions: abstract\nentities on a par with ersatz possible worlds (see e.g. Mares 1997,\nVander Laan 1997). Modal ersatzism comes in various shapes (Divers\n2002, Part III, is by far the best critical evaluation in the\nliterature). If one takes possible worlds as maximally consistent sets\nof propositions (as per Adams 1974), impossible worlds could be sets\nof propositions that are inconsistent and/or incomplete. Similarly,\nPlantingan ersatzism (possible worlds are particular states of\naffairs) or Stalnakerian ersatzism (possible worlds are world-natures\nor maximal properties) could be easily extended to accommodate\nimpossible worlds. All hands agree that such worlds come at no great\nontological or theoretical cost, once one has accepted ersatz possible\nworlds. After all, ersatz worlds are abstract: they account for\nimpossibilities, not by instantiating them as Lewisian worlds do, but\nby representing them in some way or other. Jago (2012) takes both\npossible and impossible worlds to be constructions out of positive and\nnegative facts, such as Barack Obama\u2019s not being French (see the\nentry on\n facts).\n\nThe extension of ersatzism from possible to impossible worlds appears\nto be particularly straightforward for linguistic ersatzism.\nOn this approach, possible worlds are world-books: sets of\nsentences of a special \u201cworldmaking\u201d language.\n(Carnap\u2019s (1947) state-descriptions and Jeffrey\u2019s (1983)\ncomplete consistent novels are examples of this strategy.) It is easy\nto admit impossible worlds of the same kind, that is, world-books\nwhich are locally inconsistent or incomplete, which fail to comply\nwith some logical law or to be closed under some notion or other of\nlogical consequence.\n\nHowever, there may be reasons to reject the Parity Thesis. If\nLewis\u2019s criticisms of ersatzism in On the Plurality of\nWorlds are right, then each ersatz account of impossible worlds\ninherits the limits of ersatz theories of possible worlds: each of\nthese theories has to resort to intensional entities taken as\nprimitive (such as propositions or states of affairs) in its\nexplanation of what ersatz worlds are, or to primitive modal notions\n(most often, to both). Suppose that, instead, one wants to retain the\nadvantages of both worlds (no pun intended), ersatz and genuine, when\nit comes to impossibilities. Suppose, that is, that (a) one wants to\nemploy a modal framework including both possible and impossible worlds\nto retain the theoretical benefits provided by the latter; and (b) one\nwants to stick to Lewis\u2019s project of a reductive account of\nintensional and modal notions to fully extensional ones\n(contra ersatzism); but also (c) one wants to avoid the\nunwelcome consequences of concrete impossible worlds instantiating\nimpossibilities, such as having true contradictions \u201cout\nthere\u201d in reality (contra Yagisawa\u2019s extended\nmodal realism). One could then try the following hybrid solution: (1)\ngo realist about possible worlds, and (2) exploit the set-theoretic\nmachinery of modal realism to represent different impossible worlds as\ndistinct ersatz, abstract constructions.\n\nTo fulfil these desiderata, Berto 2010 sketches an intermediate\naccount, labeled as Hybrid Modal Realism (HMR), which\ndispenses with the Parity Thesis. The account follows suggestions from\nDivers 2002, Chapter 5, and is similar to a strategy pursued in\nKiourti 2010, Chapter 3. On this view, genuine, concrete possible\nworlds are the basic stuff. Atomic propositions are taken as sets of\npossible worlds. Distinct impossible situations can then be\nrepresented by distinct world-books, taken as set-theoretic\nconstructions from atomic propositions. Krakauer 2013 gives a similar\naccount in terms of\n structured propositions\n built out of ordinary possible worlds. Jago 2012 and Send\u0142ak\n2015 criticise Berto\u2019s approach on the basis that it cannot\ndistinguish the proposition that Hesperus is the second planet\nfrom the sun from the proposition that Phosphorus is the\nsecond planet from the sun. Reinert 2018 attempts to do better by\ncombining Lewisian possible worlds with an ersatz situation-based\naccount of impossible worlds. Fouch\u00e9 2022 develops\nBerto\u2019s hybrid account into a full-fledged hyperintensional\ntheory of content.\n\nA metaphysical account of impossible worlds, alternative both to\nersatzism and to Lewisian realism, has been proposed in Zalta 1997.\nZalta\u2019s powerful theory of abstract objects is based upon his\nlogic of encoding, whose core idea consists in postulating an\nambiguity in the copula of predication: \u201c\\(x\\) is \\(P\\)\u201d\ncan mean that object \\(x\\) exemplifies property \\(P\\), as per ordinary\npredication; but it may also mean that \\(x\\) encodes \\(P\\),\nencoding being a special mode of predication. Abstract objects encode\nproperties, besides exemplifying them; in particular, they can encode\nproperties they do not exemplify (see Zalta 1983). Within this theory,\nsituations are defined as abstract objects that encode states\nof affairs (taken as 0-ary properties); and impossible worlds are\ntaken as maximal situations that are not possible, that is, such that\nit is not possible that all the states of affairs encoded by them\nsimultaneously obtain.\n\nZalta claims that, despite treating worlds as abstract objects, this\nis not an ersatz conception of worlds. A given state of affairs\n\\(p\\)\u2019s obtaining at world \\(w\\) (no matter whether \\(w\\) is\npossible or impossible) is analyzed as:\n\n(Z)  \\(w\\) encodes the\nproperty being-such-that-p, \n\n\nand so being-such-that-p is ascribed, in the encoding sense,\nto \\(w\\). As such, \\(w\\) is (in the encoding sense of the\ncopula, at least) such that \\(p\\). Thus, according to Zalta\u2019s\ntheory of encoding, worlds are in some sense metaphysically\ncharacterized or determined by such states of affairs. And according\nto Zalta nothing of the sort can be claimed of ersatz conceptions of\nworlds.\n\nAll the ontological accounts of impossible worlds presented so far are\nin a broad sense realist. They all accept that sentences referring to\nor quantifying over impossible worlds can be literally true, and take\nthe entailed ontological commitment at face value, although they\ndisagree with each other about the metaphysical status of worlds. A\ndeeply anti-realist alternative to modal metaphysics has also been\ndeveloped:\n modal fictionalism.\n The view is fictionalist (or anti-realist) about worlds. Its\nkey claim is that talk of and quantification over worlds ought to be\nunderstood as literally false: it is only true within a \u201cworlds\nfiction\u201d. We make-believe in the fiction because it delivers\nuseful results in the explanation of modal notions. Modal fictionalism\npromises the theoretical benefits of modal realism without the\nontological costs. We should not include worlds (other than the actual\nworld) in our ontological catalogue. But talking as if there\nwere worlds is useful. Gideon Rosen (1990), a major proponent of the\nview, takes Lewisian modal realism to be the relevant fiction. But it\nis relatively easy to extend such modal fictionalist accounts into\nfictional treatments of possible and impossible worlds,\ntaking e.g. Yagisawa\u2019s extended modal realism as the fiction\nwhich we make-believe. JC Beall (2008) proposes an approach to\nimpossible worlds (see\n section 5.1),\n which can be motivated by the idea that these are worlds where\n\u201clogical fictions\u201d take place.\n",
