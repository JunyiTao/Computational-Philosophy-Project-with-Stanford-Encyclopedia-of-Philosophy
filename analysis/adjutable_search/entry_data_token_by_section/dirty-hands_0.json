    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nAnthony Trollope\u2019s novel, The Way We Live Now, is a\nbiting critique of the corruption of late Victorian morals. One of its\ncentral characters, the shallow Lady Carbury, at one point voices her\nconviction that the praiseworthy deeds of the powerful escape the\nnormal categories of morality. Commenting on the character of the\nnovel\u2019s dominant figure, the grand swindler Melmotte, she says\nto her journalist friend Mr. Booker:\n\n\n\u201cIf a thing can be made great and beneficent, a boon to\nhumanity, simply by creating a belief in it, does not a man become a\nbenefactor to his race by creating that belief?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the expense of veracity?\u201d suggested Mr. Booker.\n\n\u201cAt the expense of anything?\u201d rejoined Lady Carbury with\nenergy. \u201cOne cannot measure such men by the ordinary\nrule.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would do evil to produce good?\u201d asked Mr. Booker.\n\n\u201cI do not call it doing evil\u2026.You tell me this man may\nperhaps ruin hundreds, but then again he may create a new world in\nwhich millions will be rich and happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are an excellent casuist, Lady Carbury.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am an enthusiastic lover of beneficent audacity,\u201d said\nLady Carbury\u2026\n\n\nContemporary moral and political philosophy suffers from no lack of\nenthusiastic admirers of \u201cbeneficent audacity\u201d. At one end\nof a spectrum are those consequentialists who are so captivated by the\nprospect of the new world of \u201chappy millions\u201d that they\nthink it obscurantist to object to any evil means needed to achieve\nit\u2014indeed, they agree with Lady Carbury in not calling such\nmeans evil. At the other end of that spectrum, stand the rather more\nreluctant advocates of \u201cdirty hands\u201d who think that some\nvery good ends, such as the aversion of catastrophe, require the doing\nof evil, but unlike Lady Carbury, they insist on calling it evil,\nthough necessary evil. And like Lady Carbury, they rather think that\nthe agents who so dirty their hands cannot be measured \u201cby the\nordinary rule.\u201d Even so, like W.H. Auden in his poem\n\u201cSpain\u201d, they think such agents doing what current\ncircumstances make \u201cnecessary\u201d should accept the guilt\nthat their immoral actions earn. As Auden puts it:\n\n\n\u201cTo-day the deliberate increase in the chances of death,\n\nThe conscious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder.\u201d\n\n\nThe dirty hands tradition dates back to Machiavelli, though its\npresent currency is largely owed to the American political theorist\nMichael Walzer who gave it the title of dirty hands in an influential\narticle \u201cPolitical Action: the Problem of Dirty Hands\u201d, in\nwhich he coined the term \u201cdirty hands\u201d adapting it from\nJean Paul Sartre\u2019s play of the same name (Walzer 1973). Later,\nWalzer used the idea, though not the term, in his book Just and\nUnjust Wars (1977) in which he argued that an appeal to\n\u201csupreme emergency\u201d could not only explain but justify the\nAllied terror bombing of German cities in the early stages of World\nWar II (Walzer 1977a, 267\u201368). For these early stages, roughly\n(it seems, for Walzer gives no date) up to the end of 1941, the\ndeliberate massacre of thousands of German non-combatants was required\nby supreme emergency, even though it was gravely immoral. The prospect\nand likelihood of a Nazi victory were so dire for the lives and\ncommunal values of those facing defeat that the price of severe\nimmorality was worth paying. In the subsequent conduct of the war,\nWalzer argued, the city bombings were simply immoral (as were the city\nbombings of Japan, including the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and\nNagasaki) and could not be justified by supreme\n emergency.[1]\n When Walzer later revisited the topic of supreme emergency, he made\nit clear that it was a case of dirty hands, indeed he seems to have\ncome to the view that only something like the circumstances\nof supreme emergency could provide a dirty hands justification. So he\nsays, in the later discussion of supreme emergency, that the doctrine\nof dirty hands is that \u201caccording to which political and\nmilitary leaders may sometimes find themselves in situations where\nthey cannot avoid acting immorally, even when that means deliberately\nkilling the innocent.\u201d And again: \u201c\u2026dirty hands\naren\u2019t permissible (or necessary) when anything less than the\nongoingness of the community is at stake, or when the danger that we\nface is anything less than communal death\u201d (Walzer 2004a,\n46).\n",
