    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nRegius was born in Utrecht, The Netherlands (the Republic of the Seven\nUnited Netherlands at the time), on 29 July 1598, into a wealthy\nfamily of brewers, and died on 19 February 1679 in the same\ncity. Following initial studies in Arts at the University of Franeker,\nhe studied medicine at Groningen and Leiden, and subsequently at the\nUniversity of Montpellier (France). In 1623 he received his MD from\nthe University of Padua (Italy). Regius was appointed town physician\nin Utrecht on his return there in 1625 and, following a period as\nheadmaster of the Latin School at Naarden (where he was challenged\nabout his religious orthodoxy as a Calvinist), he returned to Utrecht\nin 1634 and was re-appointed town physician in 1637. The Illustrious\nSchool of Utrecht had become a university in 1636 and, two years\nlater, Regius was appointed \u2018extraordinary\u2019 Professor of\nTheoretical Medicine and Botany (equivalent to an associate professor,\nwho was paid a significantly reduced salary). The following year,\n1639, he was promoted to full professor. In 1640 Regius was awarded a\nsalary increase, on the understanding that he would provide extra\nlectures to his students on natural philosophy. Since there were\nalready professors of philosophy, mathematics, and theology in place\nat Utrecht, all of whom were senior to Regius, this extension of his\ncontract included the seeds of subsequent controversies about\nphilosophical and theological theses, and of disputes about\ndisciplinary boundaries at the University.\n\n\nRegius first came to Descartes\u2019 attention through a mutual friend,\nHenricus Reneri (1593\u20131639), and almost immediately (in August\n1638) began a correspondence with Descartes, which continued until\n1645. In keeping with the custom at that time, he also presided as a\nprofessor over disputations at the University (the equivalent of\nresearch seminars, presented by students in the form of a defence of\ntheses that were composed by their supervisor). The texts of\ndisputations were normally printed and distributed in advance\nof their oral presentation, and some rare copies of Regius\u2019\ndisputations survive. These were initially concerned with medical\nmatters, such as a controversial disputation supporting Harvey\u2019s\ntheory of blood circulation (Regius 1640a). During the year 1641,\nRegius considered publishing a book on natural philosophy, and\nconsulted both Descartes and Gisbertus Voetius (1589\u20131676), the\nProfessor of Theology and University Rector, about his plans. While\nDescartes recommended that Regius develop his ideas in the form of\ndisputations, Voetius initially advised publication as a monograph,\npossibly to avoid conflict with faculty members in theology or\nphilosophy. Regius adopted Descartes\u2019 advice and, in April 1641, he\nbegan a series of disputations under the title Physiologia sive\ncognitio sanitatis (Regius 1641a).\n\n\nIn November 1641, however, Regius initiated a new series of\ndisputations, De illustribus aliquot quaestionibus\nphysiologicis (Regius 1641b), in which he challenged Aristotelian\ntheses that were taught by his colleagues in philosophy and theology at\nthe University. This attracted a very negative response from Voetius,\nwho relied on Aristotelian philosophy to articulate his version of\nCalvinist theology. The resulting lengthy controversy, during which\nRegius lost the support of Descartes while simultaneously continuing\nthe conflict with Voetius, is discussed below. He published the first\nedition of his book on natural philosophy under the title\nFundamenta physices (1646); Chapter XII, entitled De\nhomine (Regius 1646, 245\u2013306), provided a synoptic\nexposition of his controversial views about human nature.\n\n\nDespite the bitter and extended controversy in which Regius engaged\nwith Voetius and the university authorities, he was later appointed Rector of\nthe University of Utrecht (a one-year honorary position) in 1649, and\nagain in 1662. He published an amended, enlarged edition of the\nFundamenta physices under the title Philosophia\nnaturalis in 1654, and a third edition in 1661. A French\ntranslation appeared in 1687. He remained in Utrecht, except for a\nbrief period when he was captured as a hostage by the French army in\nlate 1673, and died there in 1679.\n2. Dispute with Voetius and Descartes\n\n\nRegius attributed his appointment at Utrecht University to his\nfamiliarity with and support for Cartesian philosophy, which was\nacquired initially by reading Descartes\u2019 first book, the Discours\nde la M\u00e9thode \u2026 plus la Dioptrique, les\nM\u00e9t\u00e9ores et la G\u00e9ometrie, 1637 (AT,\nvol. VI). Regius was sympathetic to Cartesian natural philosophy from\nhis initial reading and began to teach it to students, in private\nlessons, and to dictate notes with a view to publishing his own\nsummary of natural philosophy based on Cartesian principles. This\nobjective was further encouraged when he read a copy of Descartes\u2019\nunpublished manuscript, Le Monde (AT, vol.  XI), in 1641. The\nnatural philosophy of Le Monde rejected scholastic forms and\nqualities as philosophical entities that contributed nothing to an\nexplanation of natural phenomena. There was a significant difference,\nhowever, in a university such as Utrecht between not relying on\nscholastic forms and criticizing them publicly. The transition from\nthe former to the latter, in the case of Regius, occurred in 1641.\n\n\nWhile preparing Physiologia (Regius 1641a), Regius sent\nadvance copies of draft disputations to Descartes. Since they were\nbeing presented in Utrecht as examples of Cartesian philosophy,\nDescartes recommended various changes, both to avoid needless\ncontroversy (for example, concerning blood circulation) and, more\nimportantly, to avoid accusations of heresy against himself or\nRegius. Accordingly, he asked Regius to correct the thesis that the\nhuman soul is three-fold, and to argue instead that \u201cin human\nbeings the soul is one, namely a rational soul\u201d (AT III,\n369\u201374: Bos 2002, 63\u201369). During the year 1641, this\npattern of prior consultation with Descartes continued; Regius\naccepted many of Descartes\u2019 suggestions, and incorporated them into\nthe final versions of the disputations.\n\n\nIn November 1641, however, the Utrecht professor inaugurated another\nseries of disputations in which he transgressed from medicine to\nphilosophy and, by implication, into theology, and thereby provoked a\ncontroversy that continued for more than a decade. The most explicit\nchallenge to established Aristotelian teaching occurred when one of\nRegius\u2019 students, Henricus van Loon, claimed in a disputation (8\nDecember 1641) that the human mind and body are two distinct\nsubstances which are joined together in an accidental union [unum\nper accidens].  This thesis addressed, perhaps inadvertently, one\nof the most contentious issues in Christian philosophy and\ntheology, viz.  how to understand the unity of human nature,\nas experienced by each subject, and at the same time defend the\ntraditional Christian beliefs in the immortality of the human soul or\nmind and the resurrection of the body. The immortality of the soul\nseemed to presuppose that the mind or soul was capable of existing\nwithout the body and, for that reason, that it should be classified as\nan Aristotelian substance. When Descartes was informed about this\ndisputation (when it was already too late to recommend amendments), he\nresponded that there was hardly anything more likely to offend or\nantagonize theologians than to say that a human being \u201cis an\naccidental being\u201d (AT III, 460: Bos 2002, 90\u201391).\n\n\nVoetius, with the support of his professorial colleagues in theology,\nreplied to Regius by appending corollaries to his own theological\ndisputations, in December 1641, in which he accused proponents of the\n\u2018new philosophy\u2019 [i.e., Cartesianism] of a number of\nerrors: teaching that a human being is an accidental being, defending\nCopernicanism, and supporting scepticism and irreligion by denying\nsubstantial forms. In the course of these replies to Regius,\nDescartes\u2019 name was also mentioned, and it was clear that Regius and\nDescartes were perceived by Voetius as jointly attempting to undermine\nthe philosophical foundations of Calvinist theology as taught at\nUtrecht. Initially, Descartes joined the debate merely by advising\nRegius how to respond appropriately to Voetius. One part of that\nadvice was that Regius should have dealt with substantial forms as\nDescartes had done in the M\u00e9t\u00e9ores (AT VI,\n239): that he should not have rejected them explicitly but, instead,\nshould merely have omitted them as redundant to genuine\nexplanations.\n\n\nHowever, Descartes also provided Regius with philosophical arguments\nin reply to Voetius. He outlined a number of reasons why they were\njointly opposed to describing the human mind as a substantial form. To\nsay that human beings think because they have a \u2018thinking\nform\u2019 explains nothing; secondly, those who postulate the\nexistence of substantial forms are unable to say more precisely what\nthey are, and thus they appeal to \u2018occult\u2019 realities that\nthey do not understand; and, perhaps most importantly, if the alleged\nsubstantial forms of other natural phenomena were made redundant by \ndevelopments in physics, there would be a danger that the spirituality\nof the mind or soul would be compromised by similar advances in the\nsciences.  \u201cAll the arguments that are used to prove substantial\nforms may be applied to the form of a clock, although no one claims\nthat it is substantial\u201d (AT III, 505: Bos 2002, 115). Many of\nDescartes\u2019 suggestions were incorporated, as amendments, into the\nfinal version of the Regius\u2019 reply to Voetius, which appeared as\nResponsio, sive notae in Appendicem (Regius 1642) on 16\nFebruary 1642. This further inflamed the situation. The following\nmonth, Regius was forbidden by the University to teach natural philosophy in\npublic or in private, and was restricted to lecturing in traditional\nmedicine. The Academic Senate, with the approval of\nthe town council, also issued an official condemnation of Cartesian\nphilosophy. \n\n\nDescartes later joined the controversy in a more public way. He\nincluded a letter to a French Jesuit, \u2018A Letter to Father\nDinet,\u2019 in the second edition of the Meditations (1642),\nwhich was published in Amsterdam and thus became readily available to\nhis critics in Utrecht. While the letter to Dinet criticised Voetius\nwithout naming him explicitly, Descartes\u2019 subsequent\nEpistola ad Voetium (1643) went further by removing the\napparent anonymity of his target in the first letter. The complex\nhistory of the next few years, which is summarized in Verbeek 1992,\nincluded an official ban on the teaching of Cartesian philosophy by the\nlocal authority in Utrecht (the Vroedschap), and the establishment by\nthe same authority of a committee of inquiry into the public\ncontroversy that resulted from Regius\u2019 teaching of Cartesian\nphilosophy. The official report of the university committee on the\nwhole affair, to date, was published in 1643 as the Narratio\nhistorica (Verbeek 1988, 71\u2013123). Meantime, Voetius arranged\nfor one of his supporters, Martinus Schoock (1614\u201369), to write\nan extensive critique of Descartes and Cartesianism, which was\npublished as Admiranda methodus (The Admirable\nMethod) in Utrecht in 1643 (Schoock 1643). The\nAdmirable Method listed, among the most serious charges against\nDescartes, that he was an atheist and a sceptic, and it implied that he\ndeserved the same treatment as heretics, such as Giulio Cesare Vanini\n(1585\u20131619), who had been burned at the stake in Toulouse. While\nthe authorship of this book, Descartes\u2019 replies to it, and\nvarious legal charges of defamation and libel continued for some years,\nDescartes concluded his contribution to the controversy with Voetius in\nthe Apologetic Letter to the Magistrates of Utrecht, which was\nwritten in 1647 and sent to Utrecht in February 1648 (Bos 1999).\n\n\nThe intensity of the dispute between Voetius and those whom he\nidentified as proponents of a \u2018new philosophy\u2019 might\nsuggest agreement, at least between Descartes and Regius, on a common\nphilosophical position. In the course of the Utrecht controversy,\nhowever, an irretrievable breakdown developed in relations between\nDescartes and his former supporter. The epistemology favoured by\nRegius, which reflected his disciplinary expertise in medicine and\nphysiology, left little room for Cartesian metaphysics. When he wrote\nto Descartes, in July 1645 (AT IV, 254\u20136: Bos 2002,\n189\u201390), that many reputable people believed that Descartes\nsecretly held views about the human mind and God that differed from\nthose that he published, and that he had discredited his philosophy by\npublishing the Meditations, it seemed to Descartes that Regius\nwas endorsing the same criticisms that Voetius and Schoock had\nmade earlier. The following year, against Descartes\u2019 advice, Regius published\nthe Fundamenta physices, in which he rejected a number of\nDescartes\u2019 metaphysical theses and thereby incurred the wrath of\nhis former mentor. The French philosopher denounced Regius, as\nmisrepresenting his philosophy, in the preface to the French edition of\nthe Principles of Philosophy (1647). Regius planned to reply\nby adding twenty-one Corollaries to a medical disputation that was scheduled\nfor 2 October 1647, concerning a forty-year old man who had\ninflammation of the feet and legs (Regius 1647b). These Corollaries\nincluded three of the more contentious claims about the mind and God\nthat Regius had earlier removed from Fundamenta physices in\nan unsuccessful attempt to appease Descartes. Although the\ndisputation was banned by the University rector, Regius had already\ndisseminated copies of the text, including the controversial\nCorollaria. Descartes replied with Notae in programma\nquoddam (1648)\u2014i.e., Notes on a Certain\nManifesto\u2014to which Regius replied with an extended version\nof the Corollaria, in A Brief Explanation of the Human Mind\nor the Rational Soul, in which is explained what it is and what it may\nbe (Regius 1648).\n\n\nThe main source of disagreement between Descartes and Regius was their\nrespective accounts of human nature. This had emerged as early as\n1640, when Regius commented on a draft of the Meditations,\nand more explicitly in the disputation (December 1641), which proposed\nthe thesis that the human mind and body are united in an\n\u2018accidental unity.\u2019 In July 1645, when Descartes responded\nto a draft of the Fundamenta\nphysices, he argued that Regius had gone too far in the\nopposite direction by making the union of mind and body so close that\nthe mind was merely a \u2018mode\u2019 of the body\u2014which was\nan even greater error than his earlier mistake (AT IV, 250: Bos 2002,\n188). This issue, of how to conceive of the mind and body as united\nand yet separable, dominated the series of claims and counter-claims\nmade by both philosophers up to 1648. Between 1648 and February 1650,\nwhen Descartes died, the two philosophers did not engage directly with\neach other. Descartes discussed a range of questions with Burman in\n1648, and in response to one query he provided another reminder of the\nextent to which Regius allegedly misunderstood his\nmetaphysics. \u201cAs far as Regius is concerned \u2026 in physics\nhe has always been anxious to follow the views of the author [i.e.,\nDescartes] \u2026 whereas in metaphysics he has done everything\npossible to contradict the author\u2019s views\u201d (Descartes CB, 38:\nAT V, 170).  Descartes\u2019 last publication, Les Passions de\nl\u2019Ame (1649: AT, vol. XI), may be read as his final attempt to\naddress the source of their disagreement, and Regius 1650 may be seen\nas Regius\u2019 response (Verbeek 2017).\n3. Theory of Knowledge and Philosophy of Science\n\n\nOnce Regius had publicly established his independence vis-\u00e0-vis\nDescartes in 1647, he began to publish a theory of knowledge that\nreflected his medical interests (Bellis, 2013) and complemented the account of human\nnature that he adopted in opposition to his former mentor. The result\nwas an epistemology that was closer to that which appeared, almost\nfour decades later, in Locke\u2019s Essay than anything that he\nhad read in Descartes. This transition had begun while drafting\nFundamenta physices, in which Regius denied the need for any\ninnate ideas, including even the idea of God.\n\n\nThe mind, in order to think, does not seem to need innate ideas,\nimages, notions or axioms; rather, its innate faculty of thinking is\nsufficient on its own in order for it to complete all its thinking\nactivities. This is evident in the perception of pain, colour, taste,\nand other similar perceptions, which are genuinely perceived by the\nmind, although none of those ideas is innate. Nor is there any reason\nwhy some ideas rather than others should be innate by their very\nnature. (Regius 1646, 251)\n\n\nRegius supported this with the claim that a young person who had not\nbeen educated would, if asked, deny knowledge of things of which they\nhad no experience (1654, 251). Since an innate idea of God was central\nto the Cartesian project, Regius made his own position explicit by\nalso denying that the idea of God is innate: \u201cEven the idea of\nGod \u2026 does not seem to be innate in us, but is produced in us\ninitially by observing things or is passed on to us by others\u201d\n(Regius 1646, 252).\n\n\nRegius rejected the innateness of ideas for the same reason that\nDescartes had rejected various scholastic entities: it was redundant\nto an adequate explanation of thinking.\n\n\nIt is evident from the perception of titillation and of pain, of\nsounds and light, which arise from the motion of an objective body,\nthat the stimulation of the senses does not require intentional\nspecies, nor spiritual qualities, nor any other unintelligible things,\nbut that local motion alone and its variations suffice for this\npurpose. (Regius 1646, 253\u20134)\n\n\nHe repeated the denial of innate ideas in the Corollaries of 1647:\n\u201cThe mind does not need innate ideas, or notions, or axioms; its\nfaculty of thinking alone is enough for it to perform its own\nactions\u201d (Regius 1647b, Corollary 12). Descartes\u2019 reply, in\nthe Notae (Descartes 1648), conceded the validity of Regius\u2019\nclaim by accepting that their disagreement was merely verbal: \u201cI\nnever wrote or claimed that the mind needs innate ideas which are\nanything other than its faculty of thinking\u201d (AT VIII-2,\n357). Regius subsequently generalized his claim, in\nPhilosophia naturalis (1654: 335); apart from what\nis revealed in Scripture, he argued, all thoughts originate in sensory\nexperience.\n\n\nAll those [i.e., conscious acts], which do not originate in divine\nrevelation, are sensations or derive their origin from sensation. For\nwe cannot will, judge, or remember anything, nor imagine anything, nor\notherwise perceive anything, unless some idea of that thing had been\nimmediately or mediately produced in us by sensation, or subsequently\ntriggered and presented to the mind.\n\n\nThis unequivocally empiricist claim was compounded by the denial of\nany \u2018pure intellect.\u2019 Regius had never appealed to a\n\u2018pure understanding\u2019 as a source of ideas, and had often\nasserted the \u2018organic\u2019 connection between mind and\nbody. He had defined \u2018organic\u2019, in the first of his\nPhysiologia disputations (Bos 2002, 200), in contrast with\n\u2018inorganic\u2019 as almost a synonym for \u2018bodily\ndependent\u2019. Organic parts of the body, such as the nerves,\nveins, or muscles, required a certain physical conformation of the\nbody in order to perform an action. When applied to the mind,\ntherefore, the term \u2018organic\u2019 suggested that the mind\ncould perform mental operations only on condition that various bodily\nparts functioned appropriately at the same time.\n\n\nThese early hints, which were short of an outright denial of a pure\nunderstanding, were interpreted correctly by Descartes in 1647. Regius\nhad defined perception in his banned disputation as \u2018sensation,\nremembering and imagining\u2019 (Regius 1647b: Corollaries,\nno. 18), and Descartes concluded that he was implicitly denying the\nreality of pure understanding: \u201cOne could draw the conclusion\nthat he does not accept any pure understanding, that is, an\nunderstanding that is not concerned with physical images; and\ntherefore he thinks that we have no knowledge of God or the human\nsoul, or of other non-physical things\u201d (AT VIII-2, 363). Regius\nconfirmed that interpretation in his reply: \u201cThe human mind,\nalthough it is a substance that is really distinct from the body, is\nhowever organic in all its actions while it is in the body \u2026 it\ncannot perform any of its actions without bodily organs\u201d (Regius\n1648, 10).  Perhaps he had been applying Descartes\u2019 previous advice\nabout substantial forms\u2014to ignore them rather than deny their\nexistence explicitly\u2014when he refrained from denying a pure\nunderstanding in his earlier writings. By 1654, however, he was ready\nto publish an explicit denial: \u201cSince \u2026 we are able to\nexplain all its operations [i.e., those of the mind] by those\nfaculties of the intellect, which were already explained, there is no\nneed to add to them a pure intellect or anything similar as something\nthat is distinct from them\u201d (Regius 1654, 404). Nonetheless, the\ndenial of a pure intellect did not imply denying that human beings\nhave an idea of God; the latter is acquired in the same way as other\nideas, namely by using an intellect that is organically dependent on\nthe human body.\n\n\nSince all ideas originate in sensation, Regius had to acknowledge that\nwe often come to have ideas that originate from imagined realities and\nthat, in the case of veridical and non-veridical perceptions, the\nsubjective experiences are often sufficiently similar that one cannot\nbe certain of a correspondence between ideas and reality. In contrast\nwith the Cartesian rational defence of the reliability of our\ncognitive faculties, Regius claimed that one must rely on Scripture\nfor this purpose (Regius 1646, 249). However, Scripture does not\nguarantee that our perceptions are always certain. This issue was\nparticularly acute when the realities in question were unobservable\n(Regius 1646, 4).  Regius thought it was obvious that physical bodies\nare composed of insensible particles, and that their description is a\nmatter of hypothesis. When faced with the task of explanation,\ntherefore, he took refuge in some of the central themes of Cartesian\nnatural philosophy. He borrowed the \u2018fable\u2019 used by\nDescartes in Le Monde, that the natural world is composed of\none matter, that it is divided into parts of various sizes and shapes\nin motion, and that all natural phenomena may be explained by the laws\nof nature that apply to those parts (Regius 1646, 4).\n\n\nThis is the positive side of Regius\u2019 account of explanation.  The\nnegative side, as with Descartes, is a rejection of forms and\nqualities as understood by scholastic philosophers. For example,\nRegius had argued in 1641 that one does not explain how the heart\nworks by introducing a \u2018sentient and vegetative soul.\u2019 He\ncommented: \u201cThat is saying nothing more than this: that the\nheart is moved by whatever is the principle by which we live, sense\nand move (for that is how the soul is defined), which begs the\nquestion as to what that is\u201d (Regius 1641b, Disputatio VI,\nCorollary, par. V). Such an explanation of the heart\u2019s motion is\nsimilar to explaining the motion of a clock by \u2018a faculty of a\ncertain kind.\u2019 Regius proposed instead that we think of the\nworld as a great machine, and that we explain natural phenomena by\nhypothesizing how that machine works.\n\n\nThe world, therefore, is a great machine and each of its parts is a\nsmall machine, in which it can be observed and easily demonstrated\nthat there is nothing other than motion or rest, together with size,\nposition, and shape (I wish to make a unique exception of our soul).\nHowever, I regard the forms which are said to be substantial and\nlikewise qualities of a corporeal substance, whether occult or\nmanifest \u2026 as mere non-entities, which conceal our ignorance of\ncauses. (Regius 1641b, para. ix)\n\n\nIt follows from this kind of speculative reasoning about the\nunobservable inner structure of natural phenomena that scientific\nknowledge is only more or less probable. If we imagine a likely cause\nof some phenomenon as a configuration of unobservable particles and,\ndespite further research, cannot discover another possible cause that\nis either as likely or more likely, we should rest content with the\nfirst hypothesis until something better is discovered.\n\n\nWhen any question in physics is proposed for resolution, one should\nfirst think of an intelligible cause by which the effect that is\nobserved in the proposed problem could be explained intelligibly and\nappropriately. One should then look to see if a more appropriate or\nequally appropriate cause can be found. If a more appropriate cause is\nfound, it should be preferred. If one that is equally appropriate is\nfound, it should be treated as equally confirmed. However, if none is\nfound that is equally or more appropriate, the solution found should\nbe adopted until a better or equally good one is found. (Regius 1654,\nEpilogue)\n\n\nThe acceptance of probable hypotheses as the best available was a\nsignificant revision of a model of human knowledge, originally derived\nfrom Aristotle, according to which genuine knowledge must achieve the\ndegree of certainty that is provided by intuition and demonstration\n(Clarke 2011).  While other natural philosophers, even at the\nconclusion of the seventeenth century, refused to classify\nexplanations of natural phenomena as knowledge, because they were\nuncertain, Regius had accepted in mid-century that such uncertainty is\ninevitable except in the case of divine revelation. \u201cAlthough,\napart from divine revelation, there is no apodictic certainty about\nthings that exist outside our mind, but only moral or probable and\nlikely certainty, that is still sufficient to perform adequately and\nto control all the activities of human life, since nothing more is\nrequired for them apart from moral or probable truth or the certainty\nand likelihood of knowledge\u201d (Regius 1654, 351).\n4. Theory of Human Nature\n\n\nRegius acknowledged objections, as early as 1641, to scholastic\ndescriptions of human nature, according to which the human mind or\nsoul was the substantial form of the body that was capable, after\ndeath, of existing on its own. As indicated above, he accepted\nDescartes\u2019 general objections to the intelligibility and explanatory\nusefulness of substantial forms. It was unclear to him, therefore, how\nsuch forms could be used to describe or explain human nature. His\nreservations about substantial forms were articulated in the draft\ncopy of Fundamenta physices, which he had sent to Descartes prior\nto publication. The latter\u2019s objections caused Regius to delete three\nof the more controversial claims about God and the soul from the\npublished text. However, they re-appeared in the Corollaries of Regius\n1647b, and in the second edition of the text, Philosophia\nnaturalis (1654).\n\n\nDescartes had defined material substance in terms of its principal\nattribute, extension. Regius endorsed that position when he rejected\nany distinction between a corporeal substance and its extension.\n\n\nThere is no need to imagine that there is a substance in a body in\nwhich extension exists, and that it is something which in its nature\nor in reality is distinct from extension, because realities should not\nbe multiplied without necessity. Extension does not need such a\nsubject, as something that is distinct from itself; but it is\ncapable of existing on its own. (Regius 1646, 2; the phrase in italics\nwas added in Regius 1654, 3.)\n\n\nOne would expect the same logic to apply to thinking, as an attribute\nthat does not require a distinct substance. Nonetheless, Regius initially\nstopped short of saying that. While accepting that divine revelation\nteaches that the mind is a substance, he emphasized that it is\norganically united with the body. \u201cThe human mind, although it\nis a substance that is really distinct from the body, is however\norganic as long as it exists in the body\u201d (1646, 246). The mind\nwas also described as being \u201cunited most closely with the body\nin one substance\u201d (Regius 1646, 248).\n\n\nHowever, once he had been rebuked publicly by Descartes, Regius was\nfree to express himself more explicitly. In the Corollaries (Regius\n1647b), he wrote:\n\n\nAs far as the nature of things is concerned, it seems possible for the\nsoul to be either a substance or a mode of a physical substance.  Or,\nif we follow some other philosophers [i.e., Descartes] who stipulate\nthat extension and thought are attributes which are present in certain\nsubstances as their subjects, then since these attributes are not\nopposites but are just different from each other, there is nothing to\nprevent the mind from being an attribute of some kind which applies to\nthe same subject as extension, even though neither attribute is\nincluded in the concept of the other (thesis 2).\n\n\nThis is further developed in Regius 1654, in which he argues that the\nconcepts of extension and thinking are not incompatible and,\n\u201caccordingly, they [the attributes] may both be present in the\nsame simple subject\u201d (337). This anticipates the question (and\nthe implied answer) that was discussed by Locke, in the Essay\nIV, iii, 6, whether God may have superadded thought to a material\nsubstance. In the version proposed by Regius, there are no reasons why\nit would be impossible for a material entity to have the property of\nthinking because, although thinking and extension have nothing in\ncommon, they are not incompatible.\n\nRegius also included in the Corollaries two other theses that\nwere critical of Descartes and had been omitted from\nthe Fundamenta Physices: in thesis 3, he claimed that \u2018those\nwho assert that we conceive of the human mind clearly and distinctly\nas necessarily and really distinct from the body are mistaken\u2019, and in\nthesis 13 that \u2018all common notions that are engraved in the mind\nderive their origin from the observation of things or from\ntradition\u2019. Regius also claimed that these conclusions from experience\nand reason, within the scope of natural philosophy, were consistent\nwith thesis 4, that divine revelation provides indubitable evidence\nfor belief that the human mind is a distinct substance.\n\n\nThese early statements in thesis form of criticisms of Descartes were\nsubsequently expanded in Regius 1654. Many of Descartes\u2019\ncontemporaries had understood him as arguing that there must be a real\ndistinction between mind and body because it is possible to doubt\nhaving a body although it is impossible to doubt having a mind. Regius\naddressed this argument explicitly:\n\n\nThe fact that we can doubt the body but cannot possibly doubt the mind\ndoes not prevent the mind from being a mode of the body. That merely\nproves that, while we are doubting the body, we cannot say with\ncertainty that the mind is its mode. In the mean time, since the body\nabout which we doubt may nevertheless subsist and since there is no\nreason why it may not be modified by the mind\u2014which is evident\nfrom what has been said earlier\u2014this is enough to show that the\nmind of which we are certain may be a mode of that doubtful body.\n(1654, 338)\n\n\nGiven Regius\u2019 disagreement with Descartes about the concept of a human\nmind, and his rejection of innate ideas, it was not surprising that he\nalso rejected the ontological argument for God\u2019s existence that\nDescartes had proposed in the Fifth Meditation (AT VII, 65). The Dutch\nphilosopher accepted that the \u201cactual and necessary existence of\nGod is comprehended in the idea or concept of God.\u201d He argued,\nhowever, that it does not follow from that concept that God exists\nactually and necessarily. \u201cIt merely follows that, if he existed\nanywhere, he would exist necessarily rather than contingently or that,\nin that case, he would not be capable of not existing\u201d (Regius\n1654, 357).\n\n\nOne could interpret the gradual dissociation between Regius and\nDescartes, and the rejection by the former of the latter\u2019s\nmetaphysics, as an endorsement by Regius of one dominant feature of\nthe Cartesian enterprise, namely, the new natural philosophy that was\ninaugurated in Le Monde. Regius had followed the logic of\nDescartes\u2019 natural philosophy by denying any explanatory value in the\nhypothesis of souls in animals. \u201cSince indeed the actions of\nbeasts \u2026 can be explained simply by the disposition of their\nspirits and other bodily parts, and since entities should not be\nmultiplied without necessity, we have no reason to attribute any\nintellect to beasts\u201d (Regius 1646, 241\u201342). He might have\nfollowed the same logic in the case of human intelligence, had he not\nbeen restrained by his understanding of the teaching of Scripture, and\nhis apparent acceptance on biblical grounds that the human mind is an\nimmaterial substance. Rather than endorse Cartesian metaphysics, as\nfound in the Meditations, which seemed to return its author\nto the scholastic philosophy that he explicitly rejected, Regius\nstruggled with the competing demands of Scripture and the logic of\nCartesian natural philosophy. The challenge of this conjunction is\nevident in Regius\u2019 repeated attempts to describe the unity of mind and\nbody \u2018in a single substance\u2019 (1646, 248) while maintaining\nthat the mind is \u201csomething that is really distinct from the\nbody and is separable from it in reality\u201d (1646, 246). This\nepistemic dualism, to the effect that we acquire some beliefs from\nnatural knowledge and others from Scripture, has been understood, by\nsome readers, as intellectually dishonest and as a typical libertine\ncamouflage for cryptic materialism (Hallyn, 2005). But, as Bos (2013)\nshows, Regius may have accepted the limits of human knowledge, based\non reason and experience, and also adopted a commonplace understanding\nof the certainty of Scripture. By doing so, he became a reluctant\ndualist without endorsing Cartesian metaphysics.\n",
