Zhu came to Confucianism after a little more than a\ndecade of study of and experimentation with Daoism and Chan (Zen)\nBuddhism. Like many other prominent Confucian thinkers of his era, he\nwas a great admirer of the Cheng brothers and took himself to be\nbuilding on the exegetical and theoretical foundations that they had\nlaid, although he occasionally registered disagreements with some of\ntheir remarks. In his day Zhu was just one among many prominent\nthinkers and teachers who claimed the mantle of the Cheng brothers,\nbut by the end of the Song he came to be seen as the most\nauthoritative spokesperson not just for the Chengs but for the entire\nDaoxue (Learning of the Way) tradition. His interpretation of\nthe Confucian canon became the basis of the civil service examination\nin 1313, so that over time it was closely read by many millions of\naspiring civil servants and students of Confucianism. Consequently,\nZhu\u2019s interpretation of the Confucian tradition has been treated\nby countless Confucians as orthodoxy, and continues to be so regarded\nby many adherents of Confucianism today.\n\nThere were few contemporary areas of inquiry that Zhu Xi did not\ntouch. He made more explicit than any predecesor a certain\nmetaphysical dualism of qi (vital stuff) and li\n(Pattern), which he then used to explain everything from human nature\nto the natural inclinations of plants to the acquisition of moral\nknowledge. He thought carefully and wrote extensively about methods of\ncultivating virtue, defending distinctive views both on big-picture\nissues like the role of speculation and book learning and on\nfiner-grained matters such the purpose of doing chores and the proper\nattitude to adopt when reading. He also wrote at length about\npolitics, history, and the art of administration and government\nservice (Zhu 2019).\n",
