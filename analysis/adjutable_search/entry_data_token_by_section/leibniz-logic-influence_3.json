    "main_text": "Second Wave of Reception || Johann Eduard Erdmann\n3.1 Johann Eduard Erdmann\n\n\nThe most important among these editorial projects was the edition of\nLeibniz\u2019s philosophical works God. Guil. Leibnitii opera\nphilosophica quae exstant Latina Gallica Germanica omnia (Leibniz\n1839/40; cf. Glockner 1932, 59\u201365) prepared in two volumes by\nJohann Eduard Erdmann (1805\u20131892), which included fragments,\npublished there for the first time, containing elaborations of\nLeibniz\u2019s ideas concerning logical calculi. One of the documents is\nLeibniz\u2019s 1696 letter to Gabriel Wagner which contains the famous\ndefinition of logic or the art of reasoning as the art to use the\nintellect (Verstand), i.e., not only to evaluate what is\nimagined, but also to discover (invent) what is hidden. The edition\nalso contains the seminal fragments \u201cSpecimen demonstrandi in\nabstractis\u201d and \u201cNon inelegans specimen demonstrandi in\nabstractis\u201d (Leibniz 1839/40, 94\u201397), the last with the\nalgebraic plus-minus calculus, i.e. a central specimen of Leibniz\u2019s\nvarious attempts to create logical calculi working with the two\n\u201cconstituting\u201d operations \u201cgathering\ntogether\u201d, symbolized by +, and \u201ctaking away\u201d,\nsymbolized by \u2013 (cf. Leibniz 1999, no. 178).\n\n\nJohann Eduard Erdmann studied theology and philosophy at Tartu and\nBerlin (cf. Glockner 1932). Friedrich Schleiermacher and Georg\nFriedrich Wilhelm Hegel were among his teachers. He later became a\nmember of the right wing Hegelian school. In 1839 he was appointed full\nprofessor of philosophy at the University of Halle. Erdmann became\nwell-known for his comprehensive history of modern philosophy entitled\nVersuch einer wissenschaftlichen Darstellung der Geschichte der\nNeueren Philosophie (\u201cAttempt at a scientific presentation of the\nhistory of recent philosophy\u201d), published in seven volumes (Erdmann\n1834\u20131853). This history of philosophy covers the period between\nDescartes and Hegel. In part 2 of vol. 2 of this work, Erdmann\npresented a discussion of Leibniz and the development of idealism\nbefore Kant. This presentation was published in 1842, two years after\nhis edition of Leibniz\u2019s philosophical works. Erdmann reported\nthat while preparing his history he grew unsatisfied with the available\neditions of Leibniz\u2019s works. He therefore intended to unite\nRaspe\u2019s edition with the philosophical parts of Dutens\u2019\nedition and some pieces from the unpublished papers. He started\neditorial work at the archive in Hanover in 1836.\n\n\nIn the chapter on Leibniz, Erdmann stressed the connection between\nmathematics and philosophy. He dealt with Leibniz\u2019s logic in the\nsection on the philosophical method and mentioned Leibniz\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cmethod\u201d as the way to derive all knowledge\nwith the help of \u201cprinciples of knowledge\u201d\n(Erkenntnisprinzipien) (Erdmann 1842, 109). These principles\nare the law of contradiction and the law of sufficient reason. Erdmann\nquoted Leibniz\u2019s letter to Gabriel Wagner containing the\nstatement that logic is the art to use the intellect; logic is\ntherefore the key to all sciences and arts. According to Erdmann,\nLeibniz identifies the logical method with the mathematical method regarding it as the true philosophical method. Erdmann\nfurthermore dealt at length with Leibniz\u2019s \u201cmathematical\ntreatment of philosophy\u201d not only because it was important for\nChristian Wolff and his school, but also \u201cbecause just this point\nis usually ignored in presentations of Leibniz\u2019s\nphilosophy\u201d (ibid., 114). He had good reasons for this evaluation\nbecause most of the relevant writings became only accessible in his own\nedition (Leibniz 1839/40). Erdmann discussed Leibniz\u2019s calculi\ncalling them \u201cmethodic operations\u201d with data in the\n\u201cway of calculating\u201d. He mentioned Leibniz\u2019s idea of\na character script for the calculus which allows using signs without\nalways having a particular meaning in view. Such \u201cpasigraphy\u201d\nwould eliminate the differences between the languages, but, according\nto Erdmann\u2019s evaluation, the idea of a universal language was not\nat the center of Leibniz\u2019s interests. Leibniz\u2019s main point\nwas that \u201call mistakes in reasoning will at once show up in a\nwrong combination of characters, and therefore the application of the\ncharacteristic script provides a means to discover the mistake in a\ndisputed point like in every other calculation\u201d (ibid.,\n122\u2013123).\n\n\nErdmann\u2019s discussion of Leibniz can be evaluated as follows.\nHe opened the way for the inclusion of Leibniz\u2019s conception of\nlogic into the actual philosophical debates on logic. This is all the\nmore astonishing as Erdmann was a Hegelian. Hegel was known and heavily\ncriticized for his depreciation of formal logic. On the other hand,\nstressing the close connection between philosophy and mathematics fits\ninto a time when many philosophers tried to bring philosophy back into\ncontact with the sciences.\n",
