    "main_text": "The Logic of Counterfactuals || Summary\n2.7 Summary\n\nStrict and similarity analyses of counterfactuals showed that it was\npossible to address the semantic puzzles described\nin \u00a71.4 with formally explicit\nlogical models. This dispelled widespread skepticism of\ncounterfactuals and established a major area of interdisciplinary\nresearch. Strict analyses have been revealed to provide a stronger,\nmore classical, logic, but must be integrated with a pragmatic\nexplanation of how counterfactual antecedents are interpreted\nnon-monotonically. Similarity analyses provide a much weaker, more\nnon-classical, logic, but capture the non-monotonic interpretation of\ncounterfactual antecedents within their core semantic model. It is now\na highly subtle and intensely debated question which analysis provides\na better logic for counterfactuals, and which version of each kind of\nanalysis is best. This intense scrutiny and development has also\ngenerated a wave of criticism focused on their treatment of\ntruth-conditions, Goodman\u2019s Problem, and\nintegration with thinking about counterfactuals in psychology and the\nphilosophy of science\n(\u00a72.5, \u00a72.6). None\nof these criticisms are absolutely conclusive, and these two analyses,\nparticularly the similarity analysis, remain standard in philosophy\nand linguistics. However, the criticisms are serious enough to merit\nexploring alternative analyses. These alternative accounts take\ninspiration from a particular diagnosis of the counterexamples\ndiscussed in \u00a72.5: facts\ndepend on each other, so counterfactually assuming p involves\nnot just giving up not-p, but any facts which depended\non not-p. The next section will examine analyses of this\nkind.\n",
