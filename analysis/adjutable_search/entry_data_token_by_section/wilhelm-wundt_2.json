    "main_text": "Experimental psychology: object and method || Object\n3.1 Object\n\n\u201cThe exact description of consciousness [Bewusstsein]\nis the sole aim of experimental psychology\u201d (cited by Titchener\n1921b: 164). Wundt identifies \u201cphysiological\u201d with\n\u201cexperimental\u201d\n psychology.[15]\n Thus, for Wundt, experimental psychology is the unmediated study of\nconsciousness, aided by the experimental protocols of the\nnatural sciences. Yet this definition involves two contestable\nassumptions: first, that \u201cconsciousness\u201d is susceptible to\nexperiment (rejected by Kant); second, that psychology, even if\nconceived as experimental, has for its object consciousness or\n\u201cthe mental\u201d (later rejected by the Behaviorists) (cf.\nHearst 1979b: 10). Let us focus on the first assumption, since it is\none Wundt addresses.\n\nWundt defines consciousness as \u201cinner experience;\u201d it is\nonly the \u201cimmediately\n real\u201d[16]\n phenomena constituting this experience, and nothing behind or beyond\nit, that is the object of psychological, as opposed to\nphysiological or psychophysical investigation (PP II: 636).\nWundt\u2019s project is not only a \u201cpsychology without a\nsoul\u201d, in F.A. Lange\u2019s phrase, but also a science without\na substrate tout\n court.[17]\n Wundt therefore presents himself as a radical empiricist. The subject\nof psychology \u201cis itself determined wholly and exclusively by\nits predicates\u201d, and these predicates derive solely from direct,\ninternal observation (on which below). The basic domain of inquiry,\naccordingly, is that of \u201cindividual psychology\u201d (cf. e.g.\nL III: 160, ff), i.e. of the concrete mental contents\nappearing to particular human beings, and not some mental substance or\nbundle of\n faculties.[18]\n In Wundt\u2019s declaration that individual psychology must become a\nscience via the experimental manipulation of inner phenomena, we see a\npragmatic attitude perhaps peculiar to the working scientist: the\nfuture science as doctrine takes shape in and through the\npresent practice of experimentation, its essays, assays,\ntrials, and errors. Instead of simply submitting to Kant\u2019s\ninjunctions against the very possibility of a scientific psychology,\nWundt finds that certain aspects of our inner experience can be, and\nin fact have been, made susceptible to experiment and mathematical\nrepresentation: Weber and Fechner did this.\n",
