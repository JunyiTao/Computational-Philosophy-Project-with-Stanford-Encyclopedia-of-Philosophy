    "main_text": "Arguments for Broad Content || Burge\u2019s Argument: Semantic Deference\n2.2 Burge\u2019s Argument: Semantic Deference\n\nThe second main source of arguments that ordinary mental content is\nbroad is a series of influential articles by Tyler Burge, including\n\u201cIndividualism and the Mental\u201d (1979). Burge has offered\nseveral lines of argument for the externalist view he calls\n\u201canti-individualism.\u201d These are helpfully distinguished\nand described in the Introduction to Burge 2007. One line of argument,\nclosely related to Putnam\u2019s water example, emphasizes the role\nof the environment in thought about natural kinds. Another line of\nargument defends anti-individualism about perceptual content. I will\nconsider a third much-discussed line of argument, which relies on the\nfact that in many cases we intend what we are thinking or talking\nabout to depend to some extent on the beliefs of others in our\ncommunity, especially those more expert than we.\n\nBurge\u2019s most famous example involves the concept of arthritis.\nHe considers an individual who is unaware that arthritis is a disease\nspecifically of the joints. His subject believes that he has arthritis\nin his thigh. This belief is false, since one cannot have arthritis in\nthe thigh. However, Burge argues, in a world in which all the\nintrinsic facts about the subject were exactly the same as they\nactually are, but in which the term \u2018arthritis\u2019 is\ngenerally used in the subject\u2019s community to refer to rheumatoid\nailments in general, the subject\u2019s belief would have a different\ncontent. It would be a belief that the subject had a rheumatoid\nailment in the thigh, and this is a belief which could possibly be\ntrue. Burge offers a wide variety of other examples making the same\npoint, involving beliefs about such things as sofas and contracts.\nThese latter examples are important because, if successful, they show\nthat broad content extends far beyond beliefs about natural kinds.\n\nThe idea that mental content is broad is the idea that it is not\ndetermined entirely by an individual\u2019s intrinsic properties, but\nis determined in part by features of the individual\u2019s\nenvironment. But if the content of my beliefs is not determined\nentirely by my internal states, what else could determine it? How\ncould anything other than my intrinsic properties determine what I\nthink and believe? The examples just discussed point to two different\nsorts of environmental factor. Putnam\u2019s example of Oscar and his\nTwin Earth duplicate focuses on the contribution of the\nnatural environment. The crucial idea here is that when we\nhave thoughts or beliefs about natural kinds, we often do not know\nwhat the essential features of those kinds are, even though we assume\nthat there are such essential features. In such cases, what we are\nthinking about depends not only on internally available factors, but\nalso on facts about the physical, chemical, or biological makeup of\nthe kinds we are thinking about. Burge\u2019s arthritis example, by\ncontrast, focuses on the contribution of the social\nenvironment. In our thoughts about many kinds of things, including\nnatural kinds but also including kinds invented by humans, such as\nfurniture or contracts, we assume that others may have more expertise\nthan we do about what is and what is not included in the kind in\nquestion. Thus, what we are thinking about depends not only on our\nintrinsic properties, but also on expert opinion. We defer to\nthe experts with regard to what exactly we are thinking about. For\nthis reason, this sort of contribution of the social environment is\nsometimes referred to as \u201csemantic deference.\u201d\n\nThe phenomenon of semantic deference is closely related to what Putnam\nmemorably termed \u201cthe linguistic division of labor.\u201d\nPutnam\u2019s idea was that as long as there are experts on what\ncertain words refer to, we do not all need to have that specialized\nknowledge; we can rely on the knowledge of the experts. In\nBurge\u2019s treatment, however, the phenomenon is not merely\nlinguistic: it is not just that we defer to the experts on the meaning\nof the word \u2018arthritis\u2019; we also defer to the\nexperts on the nature of the disease arthritis. Thus, for\nBurge, the phenomenon affects not only what we mean by the words we\nuse, but also the very contents of our thoughts.\n",
