    "main_text": "Extension\n2. Extension\n\nOne question to ask about the category of object is to ask\nwhat falls under it\u2014what is in its extension? This is the\nExtension Question. The extension of some categories is\nobvious. The extension of the category electron is all the\nelectrons and no non-electrons. The extension of the category\nnumber is all and only the numbers. The extension of the\ncategory composite things is all and only the things that\nhave proper\n parts.[14]\n For some categories, difficult questions arise. Some of those\nquestions involve the question of whether certain things are in the\nextension of the category, e.g., is the Pope in the extension of the\ncategory bachelor? Is a fetus in the extension of the\ncategory person? Some questions concern the nature of the\nthings falling under the category. The extension of the category\nbook includes all and only the books. Does it include ebooks?\nDoes it include some particular and well-loved copy of Material\nBeings, with its stained pages and cover, or the abstract type of\nwhich this particular copy is a token? Answering the Extension\nQuestion leaves many other questions unsettled, one of which is the\nnature of the things that are in the extension. But knowing which\nthings are in the extension is a good start toward figuring out their\nnature.\n\nSo, one important question to ask of the category object is\nwhich things are in its extension. This question will admit a variety\nof answers. And depending on whether there is a contrast class, it\nwill have a variety of interpretations. If object has no\ncontrast class and every thing is in its extension\u2014if both the\nmetaphysical and semantic theses of the Umbrella View are\ncorrect\u2014then the question of the extension of object is\nequivalent to the ontological question (see below). If object\nhas a contrast class\u2014if at least one of the metaphysical and\nsemantic theses of the Umbrella View is false\u2014then the question\nof the extension of object is not equivalent to the\nontological question. Instead, it asks, \u201cOf all the things there\nare, which ones are the objects?\u201d If the contrast class of\nobject is property, then the Extension Question is,\n\u201cWhat things are there that aren\u2019t properties?\u201d If\nthe contrast class is universal, the question is, \u201cWhat\nthings are there that aren\u2019t universals?\u201d If the contrast\nclass hasn\u2019t been specified, and one is starting from what\nordinary people accept, then the Extension Question is, \u201cWhat\nordinary objects are there?\u201d\n",
