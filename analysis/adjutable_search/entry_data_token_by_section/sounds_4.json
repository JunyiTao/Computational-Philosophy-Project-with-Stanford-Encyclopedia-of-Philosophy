The natural scientists\nof the seventeenth century refined the intuition that sound is a\nmovement of air into the wave theory of sounds, which appeared to be\nan obvious competitor for the quality or sensation (proximal)\nview. Galileo registered that \n\n\nsounds are made and heard by us when\u2026the air\u2026is\nruffled\u2026and moves certain cartilages of a tympanum in our\near.\u2026high tones are produced by frequent waves and low tones by\nsparse ones. (1623 [1957: 276]) \n\n\nDescartes joined in and in his Passions of the Soul\nconsidered that what we actually hear are not the objects themselves,\nbut some \u201cmovements coming from them\u201d (1649: XXIII).\nIndeed, around 1636, Mersenne measured the speed of propagation of\nsound waves.\n\nBoth Galileo and Descartes were aware that the medial account was\nrevisionary relative to a common sense view of sounds, or at least as\nrevisionary as is the sensation view. Sounds for the wave view or the\nsensation view are not what we unreflectively take them to be on the\nbasis of the content of auditory perception. (Indeed, Galileo himself\nendorsed both a proximal theory\u2014sounds as sensations\u2014and a\nmedial theory, thereby possibly originating a dualist account.) At the\nsame time Galileo and Descartes, as well as other modern philosophers,\nwere not particularly keen in detailing the phenomenological content\nof auditory perception.\n",
