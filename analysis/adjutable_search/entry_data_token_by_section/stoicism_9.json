    "main_text": "Physical Theory || Categories\n2.6 Categories\n\nAside from the basic ontology, the Stoics identify four genera of\nbeing usually referred to as \u201ccategories\u201d (see especially\nMenn 1999): matter or substance (hupokeimenon), quality\n(poion), disposition (p\u00f4s echon), relative\ndisposition or relation (pros ti p\u00f4s echon). Substance\nis a portion of passive principles or elements. An object so conceived\njust is a lump of matter (unlike prime matter, not entirely\nundifferentiated insofar as it is a portion of it, distinct from some\nother portion). Quality, which is subdivided into common and proper is\na portion of pneuma, organizing the matter so as to give it\ncertain properties. In particular, the portion of pneuma\nserves to unify the underlying matter or substance so as to make it a\nparticular object. This latter role is likely to be that of what is\nidentified as a proper quality, for example the quality of being\nSocrates (on proper qualities, see Nawar 2017). Proper qualities play\nan important role in questions about identity and individuation (cf.\nSedley 1982, Lewis 1995). Objects do not exclusively belong to one or\nthe other category. We can speak of an object as the underlying\nsubstance (the hupokeimenon) or of a qualified object capable\nof bearing further qualities. Disposition and relations are\nparadigmatically properties of already qualified objects, so that the\nfist, for example, is said to be the hand disposed in a certain way\n(Sextus, 33P). Relations are properties which depend on the relata, so\nthat a change in the relata causes the relation to cease to exist, for\nexample \u201cbeing on the right of\u201d. The categories are put to\nwork in various ways, including in ethics and psychology (see\nAlexander, 29A and Seneca, 29B), e.g. in the claim that knowledge is\nthe commanding faculty disposed in a certain way (Sextus, 33P).\n",
