    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in Infants and Non-Human Animals || Episodic Memory\n5.3 Metacognition\n\nAnother body of research pertaining to the question of\nself-consciousness in infants and non-human animals is the work on\nmetacognition (and metamemory). The term \u201cmetacognition\u201d\ntypically refers to the capacity to monitor and control one\u2019s\nown cognitive states, and is manifest in one\u2019s judgements (or\nfeelings) concerning one\u2019s own learning and consequent level of\ncertainty or confidence (J.D. Smith 2009; Beran et al. 2012; Proust\n2013; Fleming & Frith 2014). The suggestion is that if a creature\nis able to monitor their own level of confidence, they are to that\nextent self-conscious. One common paradigm for testing metacognitive\nabilities involves presenting subjects with a stimulus that they must\ncategorise in one of two ways. Crucially, they are also given the\nopportunity to opt out of the test, with correct categorisation\nresulting in the highest reward, opting out resulting in a lower\nreward, and incorrect categorisation resulting in no reward. The\nassumption is that the opt-out response reflects a meta-cognitive\njudgement of uncertainty. Evidence gathered from such a paradigm has\nbeen taken to show metacognitive abilities in some birds (Fujita et.\nal. 2012), dolphins (J.D. Smith et. al. 1995), primates (Shields et.\nal. 1997), and children from the age of around 4 years (Sodian et. al.\n2012).\n\nThe view that success on metacognitive opt-out tests is indicative of\nself-consciousness is not uncontroversial, however. For example, it\nhas been suggested that the uncertainty response is indicative not of\nmetacognitive uncertainty monitoring but rather of first-order,\nenvironmental judgements concerning a third category between the\nintended two (Kornell, Son, & Terrace 2007; Hampton 2009; also see\nCarruthers 2008; Kornell 2014; Musholt 2015: ch. 7). On such an\ninterpretation, the research on metacognition does not provide\ncompelling evidence regarding self-consciousness in infants and\nnon-human animals (but for critical discussion see J.D. Smith 2005;\nJ.D. Smith, Couchman, & Beran 2014; also relevant is the\ndistinction between \u201cevaluativist\u201d and\n\u201cattributivist\u201d accounts of metacognition outlined by\nProust (2013)). The question of the significance of opt-out tests for\nattributions of self-consciousness remains controversial.\n",
