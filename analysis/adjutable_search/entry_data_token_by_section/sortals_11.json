The general opinion among\nphilosophers is that physical object is not a sortal. One reason for\nthis conclusion is that to say something is a physical object does not\ngive its essence, it doesn\u2019t determine what kind of thing it\nis\u2014this depends on the essence notion of sortal. A second\nargument is that it does not provide criteria for counting\u2014the\ntwo halves of a physical object are also physical objects\u2014this\ndepends on the counting notion of sortal. A third is that it gives the\nwrong persistence conditions\u2014the physical object which is a car\nfor a period of time and then becomes a cube of crushed metal is not\nthe same thing. This combines the essence and counting criteria for\nsortals.\n\nAyers (1974) argued that the concept of a physical object is\nfundamental to human cognitive processing and that it does provide\ncriteria for counting and persistence even though it is not a sortal\nsince it does not specify an essence. One important part of his\nargument is the clarification that a physical object is not simply the\nstuff of spatio-temporally continuous space time region but is a the\nstuff of a maximal region. That is, we do not generally regard any\nproper part of a physical object as a physical object.\n\nThe psychologist Xu (1997) has argued that the concept of a physical\nobject is an essential part of cognitive development and is present in\ninfants at a quite early stage. And she argued that physical object is\na sortal because there are counting and persistence conditions (Spelke\n1990). In contrast to Ayers, she argued that the physical object\npersists through even fairly dramatic changes, including her Biblical\nexample of Lot\u2019s wife becoming a pillar of salt (Xu 1997). Her\nposition based on her own work and that of others (Xu & Carey\n1996, Spelke 1996) is that the acquisition of the physical object\nconcept is a crucial stage in cognitive development and is a step\ntoward the development of the more refined sortal concepts that come\nwith language acquisition. And she agrees with Ayers that the\nprimitive concept remains in the cognitive repertoire of adults and\ncan be deployed in cases where someone is confronted with a physical\nobject whose further characteristics are as yet unknown. A similar\nargument is presented in Sarnecki (2008) for the necessity of a\ngeneral sortal for objects as an intermediate step toward the\nacquisition of the sortals of language.\n\nQuine (1960) articulated the claim that differentiation of the world\ninto objects occurs only with the acquisition of language and with the\nconceptual apparatus of identity and quantification. Soja et al.(1991) have provided experimental evidence that might empirically refute Quine\u2019s view. Moreover, research results in primates, such as those presented in Phillips and Santos (2007), and Mendes et al.(2008), provide additional empirical support against Quine\u2019s claim. Nonetheless, a weaker version of Quine\u2019s view has found empirical backing in Imai and Genter (1997) and Yoshida and Smith (2003), as far as quantitative differences are concerned. Also, Xu (2002) has argued that linguistic labels may play a role (in 9-months-old infants) in the acquisition of sortal concepts in infancy.\n\nIn any case, given the basic importance of object information for navigating the\nsurrounding world, it would be surprising if at least some aspects of\nthe concept of physical object was not shared by other species. There has been some\nuncertain evidence of this in primates, and recently appears to be\nstrong evidence of such a concept in very young chickens (Fontanari\net al.2014).\n7.2 Sortals, essences and basic level objects\n\nGelman (2003,2013) and others have provided evidence suggesting a mode of cognition of an essentialist character already operative in children. Specific categories of object and stuff (such as those represented by mass terms and sortals for natural and social kinds, as well as for artifacts) are here assumed to possess an underlying reality that cannot be observed directly. This assumption explains and grounds children\u2019s inductive inferences based on the categories in question. It also explains children\u2019s implicit assignment of causal and other non-obvious properties, as well as sharp and immutable boundaries to such categories. Children view some of these properties as innate. Research results (Caccione et al. 2016; Mendes et al.2018, 2011; and Santos et al.2002) highlight the possibility that essentialist cognition might develop in humans at a pre-linguistic stage, in the form of sortal object individuation. This might apply to certain primates as well (Phillips et al.2010). \n\nA related line of research initiated by Rosch (1973), Rosch et\nal. (1976) suggests that there is a category of basic level\nobjects. Although context can lead to classifications at greater or\nlesser levels of specificity, in most contexts there is a common level\nof description that speakers prefer. For example, while we might\ngenerally describe something as a mammal or a poodle, the most common\nand natural noun would be \u201cdog\u201d. Rosch found considerable\ncommonality in what are regarded as basic level objects across\ncultures although there is some variation. Her characterization of the\nbasic level classifications is that those are the level at which\nrelatively accessible information (shape, color, form of movement)\nprovide the most information about other properties of the object. If\nit is self-moving and dog-shaped it is likely to bark, eat meat, chase\ncats, et cetera. \n\nAlthough Roschian basic level objects are good candidates for\ninformative answers to the question \u201cWhat is it?\u201d they do\nnot provide traditional essences. Traditional essences as\nconceptualized by philosophers and most psychologists are necessary\nand sufficient conditions for being a member of that kind. On that\nconception, learning a new sortal requires knowing the elements and\nhow they combine to define the new kind. On Rosch\u2019s conception,\nsortal words are learned in families and the primary learning\nexperience is becoming familiar with the prototypical members of the\nkind. Prototypes are the best examples, produce the quickest responses\nwhen subjects are queried about kinds, and are the most frequently\ncited when subjects are asked to give examples. In the category of\nbirds, robins are one of the most prototypical, swans are intermediate\nand penguins are very unprototypical. Evidence for Rosch\u2019s view\nof categories, which has clear roots in the views of Wittgenstein,\nconsists of the failure to produce adequate necessary and sufficient\nconditions for most common sortals, as well as the positive\nexperimental evidence just cited.\n\nRelated to the issues of essence, Markman (1989) and Markman et\nal. (2003) have argued that children\u2019s early language learning\nis guided by several principles, one of which is the mutual\nexclusivity constraint. This constraint is that in learning words a\nguiding assumption should be that distinct words refer to distinct\nthings. While this is not always true, Markman and others provide\nevidence that this constraint is operative, and that in the language\nlearning environment of young children it is a very helpful, if\nimperfect constraint. If Rosch is correct about the existence of a\npreferred basic level of objects, it may be that speakers generally\nuse words at that level of objects and thus the exclusivity constraint\nmay be supported by the basic level object hypothesis. However, the\nexperimental data are apparently conflicting on these questions\n(Mervis et al. 1994). Scholl (2008) provides a useful discussion of\nwhether and how philosophy and psychology can interact beneficially in\nunderstanding these issues.\n8. Sortals and Logic\n8.1 Sortals and standard logic\n\nSome philosophers, perhaps most notably Carnap (1950) have used a\nconcept closely akin to sortals in formulating many-sorted logics.\nThere is a technical point to be explained and a controversy to be\ndiscussed in relation to these.\n\nSometimes in applications of first order logic, i.e., when we are\ndealing at length with a specific class of interpretations the domain\ndivides into intuitively disparate kinds of objects, e.g., people and\nnumbers. In the usual formulation, one has predicates, e.g., Px\nand Nx which are true of those kinds of things respectively,\nand so one translates the English sentence \u201cAll numbers are\nodd\u201d as \\((\\forall x)(Nx \\rightarrow Ox)\\) and \u201cSome\nperson is tall\u201d as \\((\\exists x)(Px \\mathbin{\\&} Tx)\\). In a\nmany-sorted logic distinct variables are used for the different kinds\nof objects, perhaps m, n,\u2026 for numbers and\np, q,\u2026 for people. In this language combinations\nof variables with predicates are sometimes restricted so that\nNm and Tp are well-formed but Np and Tn\nare not. If one does not make this restriction then the notation is\nexactly equivalent to standard first-order logic. A many-sorted\nlanguage is expressively equivalent to a single sorted one which has\nadditional predicates for the various sorts of things (cf. Quine\n1966).\n\nFrom a purely technical point of view, one can introduce different\nkinds of variables to reflect any distinction one wants, e.g., there\ncould be distinctive styles of variables for even numbers as opposed\nto odd ones, or for left-handed people as opposed to right-handed.\nHowever, Carnap and others who advocated a many-sorted logic for\nreasons that were more ontological than pragmatic introduced different\nvariables only for what they believed were metaphysically distinct\nkinds of entities, e.g., numbers, physical objects, sense data. In\nthis respect, there is some parallel with ultimate sortals as\ndiscussed above, although Carnap does not make an explicit connection\nwith earlier writers.\n\nA related use of many-sorted logic is to provide a kind of translation\nfrom second-order logic into a first-order logic. In this case instead\nof having second-order quantification over sets (or properties), one\nstays with a first-order language which is supplemented with a\npredicate true of all and only sets (or properties), a distinct style\nof variables for those entities, and with a two-place relation of\neither membership or instantiation.\n8.2 Logics of sortals\n\nStandard logic treats all predicate expressions alike\u2014the\npredicates can be interpreted as any subset of the domain of\nquantification. If any of the claims discussed above about sortals are\ncorrect, then the sortal predicates have distinctive properties, and a\nmore sophisticated logical treatment might provide philosophical\nillumination. One obvious and agreed on principle is that in general\nthe negation of a sortal predicate is not a sortal. This contrasts\nwith the predicates of standard logic where if F is a\npredicate, so is \\(\\neg F\\), (not-F).\n\nThis principle holds regardless of which interpretation of\n\u201csortal\u201d you take. Not only is \u201cis not a cat\u201d\nnot a substantive sortal (Wiggins), you cannot count the non-cats\nsince they include dogs, table, molecules, et cetera.\nHowever, for two of the other logical operators, disjunction and\nconjunction, the situation seems more complex. The expressions\n\u201cdog or cat\u201d, \u201capple or orange\u201d and\n\u201cfork or spoon\u201d all seem to be well-behaved with respect\nto counting and identifying; we can easily imagine a city ordinance\nforbidding homeowners to have more than four dogs or cats. On the\nother hand, \u201cdog or natural number\u201d and \u201ccat or\nclock\u201d seem to provide methods of counting but seem unnatural as\nsortals.\n\nThe first \u201csortal logic\u201d was developed in Stevenson\n(1975). Stevenson develops an account in which he says \u201cWe use\nideas of Geach, Wallace and Wiggins, although we depart from each in\ncertain respects\u201d (1975: 186). Although the formalism follows\nWallace in some respects, the main ideas seem to be those of Wiggins\nrather than Geach. Specifically, his theorem 3.4.5 affirms that for\nany sortals F, G, if b and c are the same\nF, and b is a G, then b and c are\nthe same G, which is a denial of Geach\u2019s relative\nidentity thesis.\n\nTwo principles that Stevenson adopts following Wiggins are:\n\n(i)\n For every sortal F, either F is an ultimate sortal, or there\nis an ultimate sortal G such that F is a restriction\nof G.\n(ii)\n If\ntwo sortals F and G intersect, i.e., they are both true\nof at least one object, then there is a common sortal\nH of which both F and G are restrictions.\n\n\nStevenson proves the formal consistency and completeness of his set of\naxioms. It should be noted that completeness here is with respect to\nthe language used. Since this is a minor adaptation of standard logic,\nthere is no treatment of tense or modality, some essential elements of\nWiggins\u2019s notion of sortal cannot be expressed, e.g., if a\nsortal F applies to b at one time, then it applies to\nb at all times at which b exists, and if a sortal\nF applies to b, then F necessarily applies to\nb.\n\nStevenson does not permit combinations of sortal expressions,\npresumably because there is no easy way to deal with disjunctions and\nconjunctions of sortals in his formulation. However, a slight\ncomplication of his language would suffice to handle the problem. He\nuses \u201cuS\u201d for the ultimate sortal which governs\nsortal \u201cS\u201d. If instead he introduced a set of\nletters \\(U'\\), \\(U''\\) \u2026 for ultimate sortals, he could then\nsuperscript sortal expressions to indicate the ultimate sortal that\ngoverns them. He could then permit the disjunction of \\(S^{U'}\\) and\n\\(T^{U'}\\) since they are governed by the same ultimate sortal, but\nforbid the disjunction of \\(S^{U'}\\) and \\(T^{U''}\\) since they are\ngoverned by different ultimate sortals.\n\nCocchiarella (1977) presents a formal language, though no axioms or\nrules, for a logic of sortals which includes both tense and modal\noperators. His approach, like Wiggins, considers sortals to be\nconcepts. Unlike Wiggins he gives a definition of \u201csortal\nconcept\u201d: as a socio-genetically developed cognitive ability or\ncapacity to distinguish, count and collect or classify things (1977:\n441). He disagrees with Wiggins on both principles\n (i) and (ii) above,\narguing that while they may be true for natural kind terms, there are\nno reasons to believe that there are ultimate sortals of which various\nartifact sortals are restrictions, nor that every intersection of\nsortals must fall under an ultimate sortal. Cocchiarella\u2019s\napproach also goes beyond Stevenson\u2019s in that it involves\nsecond-order logic, i.e., it includes quantification over sortal\nconcepts.\n\nCocchiarella\u2019s ideas have been presented in more rigorous formal\ndetail with axioms and consistency and completeness results for\nsecond-order logic in Freund (2000), tense logic (2001) and modalities\n(2004). More recently, Freund (2019) has formulated several bidimensional logics for sortals that consider modal, tense, and epistemic modalities, as well as complex sortals (i.e., sortals that involve logical combinations of other sortals). These systems presuppose a conceptualist philosophical background closely related to Cocchiarella\u2019s but somewhat more general.\n\nGuarina, Carrara, and Giaretta (1994) develop an account of sortals\nwithin knowledge representation, a subfield of artificial intelligence\nintended to bridge the gap between abstract formal logics and natural\nlanguages. Their definition of a sortal is that it is a predicate that\nprovides countability and is temporally stable. A predicate provides\ncountability if it does not apply to any proper part of what it\napplies to. As they explain this, \u201cstudent\u201d provides\ncountability because no proper part of a student is a student; but\n\u201cred\u201d does not provide countability because parts of red\nthings are also red. Temporal stability means that if the predicate\napplies to something at one time then it must at some other times as\nwell. This is approximately the concept Strawson had in mind. They go\non to distinguish a subset of these, the substantial sortals. A\nsubstantial sortal is one that, if it applies at all, necessarily\napplies all times. This is in close agreement with Wiggins\u2019 use\nof the term. So while \u201cstudent\u201d provides countability and\nis temporally stable, it is not ontologically rigid, so it is a sortal\nbut not a substantial sortal. On the other hand, a cat is always\nnecessarily a cat.\n\nAlthough there are obvious affinities with Strawson and Wiggins, it\nshould be noted that Guarino et al. (1994) are primarily concerned\nwith the distinction between kinds and properties of kinds, while the\nphilosophers were more concerned with things and the stuff they are\nmade of.\n\nBelnap and M\u00fcller develop an alternative account of sortals\nwithin a non-standard formal logic for tense and modality. Unlike the\nusual background of possible worlds for modality, they use ideas from\nBressan (1972) and adopt\ncases as the fundamental background notion They define a\nsortal as a predicate which is modally constant and provides\nseparability. A predicate is modally constant iff it applies\nnecessarily to something whenever it possibly applies. The idea is\nthat while someone might possibly be a student without necessarily\nbeing a student, if they are human they are necessarily human. Thus\n\u201cstudent\u201d is not a sortal but \u201chuman\u201d is. A\npredicate is modally separated just in case it is necessarily true\nthat if any two things having the property are possibly identical,\nthen they are in fact necessarily identical. Using their technical\nterminology of cases, if two things which have a modally separated\nproperty coincide in any case, then they coincide in every case.\nBelnap and M\u00fcller are explicit that they are providing a formal\nframework for classifying predicates, but that applications will\nrequire other kinds of thought:\n\n\nwhether a particular predicate is absolute is assumed to be not a\nmatter of logic, but rather of science and metaphysics. (Belnap &\nM\u00fcller 2014: 397)\n\n\nWhile there is a shared core of concerns in these last two approaches,\nit is clear that in addition to the superficial difference that Belnap\nand M\u00fcller restrict \u201csortal\u201d to approximately the\nsubstantial sortals as defined in Guarino et al. 1994, there are\ndifferences even in the area of overlap. Modal rigidity and modal\nconstancy are very similar. (Some caution is necessary here since the\nmodal logic frameworks differ.) But Belnap and M\u00fcller emphasize\nmodal separability and do not mention a counting requirement, Guarino\net al. (1994) require countability but are not concerned with modal\nidentities.\n\nIn addition to Guarino et al. (1994), computational applications of the notion of sortal can be found recently in upper ontology, a relatively new field in computer sciences. For example, Guizzardi and Wagner (2010) make central use of the notion of sortal in a conceptual framework they call Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). This framework can be used in the design and evaluation of conceptual modeling languages. In UFO, the focus on sortals is on the identity criteria they provide, which contrasts with Guarino et al. (1994) where the emphasis is put instead on countability and persistence. Besides, UFO makes a distinction, among sortals, between rigid and anti-rigid sortals. An instance of a rigid sortal S will be an instance of S in every possible world in which it exists. Anti-rigid sortals will not comply with this feature. From the authors\u2019 examples and further claims, it is clear that rigid sortals correspond to substance sortals and anti-rigid to phase sortals. Because possible worlds are involved, UFO\u2019s framework seems to be committed to individual essentialism. One will then ask whether UFO\u2019s general goal is achievable, given the critique of such essentialism by philosophers of biology. We should finally note that one can also appeal to a tense logic framework to illuminate the distinction between substance and phase sortals, in contrast with UFO\u2019s modal approach.(See Rybola and Pergl (2016a, 2016b) for further examples of recent applications of the notion of sortal in computational ontology.) \n9. Conclusion\n\nA large number of thoughtful philosophers have believed that the\ncategory of sortal was philosophically significant and this\nis a strong indication that there is something important they are\nattempting to delineate and analyze. In the last two decades cognitive\npsychologists and formal ontologists have applied the term in their\nresearch. However, our dissection of the definitions and discussions\nshow that there are numerous distinctions in question and while these\ndistinctions have significant overlap, they are not identical. It\nremains to be seen whether the sortal/non-sortal distinction marks one\nvery important difference, or numerous less important distinctions\nrelated in complex ways.",
