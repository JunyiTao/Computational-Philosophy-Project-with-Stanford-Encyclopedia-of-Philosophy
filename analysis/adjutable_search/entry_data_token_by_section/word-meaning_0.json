    "main_text": "Basics\n1. Basics\n\nThe notions of word and word meaning are problematic\nto pin down, and this is reflected in the difficulties one encounters\nin defining the basic terminology of lexical semantics. In part, this\ndepends on the fact that the term \u2018word\u2019 itself is highly\npolysemous (see, e.g., Matthews 1991; Booij 2007; Lieber 2010). For\nexample, in ordinary parlance \u2018word\u2019 is ambiguous between\na type-level reading (as in \u201cColor and colour\nare spellings of the same word\u201d), an occurrence-level reading\n(as in \u201cthere are thirteen words in the tongue-twister How\nmuch wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck\nwood?\u201d), and a token-level reading (as in \u201cJohn\nerased the last two words on the blackboard\u201d). Before proceeding\nfurther, let us then elucidate the notion of word in more detail\n (Section 1.1),\n and lay out the key questions that will guide our discussion of word\nmeaning in the rest of the entry\n (Section 1.2).\n",
