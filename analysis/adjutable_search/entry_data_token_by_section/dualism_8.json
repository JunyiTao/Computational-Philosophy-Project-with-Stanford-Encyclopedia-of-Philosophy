    "main_text": "Varieties of Dualism: Interaction || Parallelism\n3.3 Parallelism\n\n\nThe epiphenomenalist wishes to preserve the integrity of physical\nscience and the physical world, and appends those mental features that\nhe cannot reduce. The parallelist preserves both realms intact, but\ndenies all causal interaction between them. They run in harmony with\neach other, but not because their mutual influence keeps each other in\nline. That they should behave as if they were interacting\nwould seem to be a bizarre coincidence. This is why parallelism has\ntended to be adopted only by those \u2013 like Leibniz \u2013 who\nbelieve in a pre-established harmony, set in place by God. The\nprogression of thought can be seen as follows. Descartes believes in a\nmore or less natural form of interaction between immaterial mind and\nmaterial body. Malebranche thought that this was impossible naturally,\nand so required God to intervene specifically on each occasion on which\ninteraction was required. Leibniz decided that God might as well set\nthings up so that they always behaved as if they were\ninteracting, without particular intervention being required. Outside\nsuch a theistic framework, the theory is incredible. Even within such a\nframework, one might well sympathise with Berkeley\u2019s instinct that once\ngenuine interaction is ruled out one is best advised to allow that God\ncreates the physical world directly, within the mental realm itself, as\na construct out of experience.\n",
