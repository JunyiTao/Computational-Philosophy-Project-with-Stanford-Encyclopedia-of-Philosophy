    "main_text": "Natural Selection Accounts || Direct Natural Selection Approaches\n5. Unification and Pluralism\n\nSome theorists have argued for the pluralistic idea that biology may\nincorporate (at least) two notions of function, one to explain the\npresence of traits and the other to explain how those traits\ncontribute to the complex capacities of organisms (Millikan 1989;\nSober 1993; Godfrey-Smith 1994). Ron Amundson and George Lauder\n(Amundson & Lauder 1994) argue that paleontology is a part of\nbiology which cannot make use of the etiological account because the\nselection regime for extinct organisms is generally inaccessible, and\nit must therefore depend on Cummins-style functional analysis of\nfossilized remains. However, defenders of pluralism may respond that\neven if it is correct to say that not all parts of biology can use\nboth notions of function, this is consistent with both accounts having\na role within biology. \n\nSome theorists have argued that these two apparently distinct notions\nof function can be unified by regarding the target of explanation as\nthe biological fitness of a whole organism (e.g., Griffiths 1993;\nKitcher 1994; and perhaps Tinbergen 1963 according to Peter\nGodfrey-Smith 1994). Moreno and colleagues (Mossio et al. 2009; Moreno\n& Mossio 2015) have also claimed that their organizational\napproach unifies across backward-looking and forward-looking accounts\nby describing activities that atemporally account for the continuing\npersistence of traits. The viability of this account as one that is\ndistinct from etiological accounts has been challenged by Marc Artiga\nand Manolo Mart\u00ednez (Artiga & Mart\u00ednez 2016), who\nargue that the necessarily multi-generational characterization of\norganizational closure needed to accommodate biological functions for\nparental endowments to offspring (whether transmitted via gametes or\nbehavior) entails the standard etiological structure found in\nWright\u2019s account. \n\nAttention to the actual explanatory practices of contemporary\nbiologists is central to these discussions. This focus on scientific\npractice reflects broader trends within the philosophy of science,\nexpanding beyond the general and abstract questions about scientific\nepistemology and metaphysics that dominated the twentieth century. The\ndiversity of life itself is reflected in the variety of scientific\nattempts to understand it, and as philosophers of biology pursue\nfurther engagement with this variety, novel perspectives on the role\nand appropriateness of functional and teleological notions seem likely\nto result. \n",
