    "main_text": "The body from the inside || Immunity to error through misidentification\n1.2 Immunity to error through misidentification\n\nDespite their differences, all bodily experiences seem to display the\nsame epistemological signature: they ground the immunity to error\nthrough misidentification relative to the first-person of bodily\nself-ascriptions. Self-ascription of a property is said to be immune\nto error if and only if one cannot rationally doubt who instantiates\nthe property when one has gained information about the property in the\nappropriate way (although one can be mistaken about the property that\none ascribes to oneself) (Shoemaker 1968; Evans 1982). For instance,\nif I think that I am anxious because I feel anxious, my thought is\nimmune to error through misidentification of the subject. But if I\nthink that I am anxious because my psychoanalyst told me so, my\nthought is not immune to error. Indeed, the psychoanalyst may have\nconfused me with another patient, who is the person suffering from\nanxiety. To be immune, my thought must be grounded in introspection,\nthat is, on a way of gaining information about one\u2019s mental\nstates from the inside. The question is whether the\nself-ascription not only of mental properties, but also of physical\nproperties (such as body posture) can be immune to error in such a\nway. Consider the following example. I form the judgment that my legs\nare crossed while I am seated around a small table with several other\npersons. Can I rationally doubt that they are mine? If I make this\njudgment on the basis only of my seeing legs, then I can confuse my\nlegs with the legs of the person seated next to me. By contrast, if I\nmake this judgment because I feel my legs as being crossed, then the\nanswer is negative. The inside mode of body senses guarantees immunity\nto error (IEM) because they provide a privileged informational access\nto one\u2019s own body only. Because of this privileged relation, the\njudgement \u201cmy legs are crossed\u201d is not grounded in the\njudgement \u201cthese legs are crossed\u201d and in the\nidentification \u201cthese legs are mine\u201d. Proprioceptive\nexperiences suffice to justify bodily self-ascriptions such that no\nintermediary process of self-identification is required\n(Berm\u00fadez 1998; Brewer 1995; Cassam 1995; Evans 1982).\n\nBodily IEM has been taken by some as evidence that the self is\nembodied. For instance, Evans (1982) and Cassam (1997) use bodily IEM\nas an argument against the Cartesian view of the self. In a nutshell,\none can self-ascribe bodily properties as well as mental properties to\nthe self without self-identification. Hence the object of such\njudgments, the self, is not a Cartesian ego, but a bodily subject of\nboth mental and physical properties. However, others wonder if one is\nentitled to draw such a metaphysical conclusion from the\nepistemological fact of bodily IEM (Chen 2011; J. Smith 2006). Some\nfurther deny that bodily self-ascriptions display the same type of IEM\nas mental self-ascriptions (Shoemaker 1968; Coliva 2012). The IEM of\npain self-ascriptions, for instance, is said to be absolute or\nlogical. On this view, there is no possible world in which one can\nfeel pain and be mistaken about who is feeling pain. By contrast, one\ncan easily conceive a case of a cross-wiring scenario such that A is\nconnected through A\u2019s proprioceptive system both to A\u2019s\nbody and to B\u2019s body. Then A can feel B\u2019s legs being\ncrossed. The question then is whether this cross-wiring scenario\ninvalidates bodily IEM. One can also wonder about actual breach of\nbodily IEM, such as the rubber hand illusion in which subjects\nself-ascribe a hand that does not belong to them (Mizumoto &\nIshikawa 2005). However, one might reply that none of these thought\nexperiments or bodily illusions show that bodily sensations fail to\nguarantee IEM because the epistemic grounds of bodily self-ascriptions\nin these cases differ from ordinary somatosensory judgments (Salje\n2017; Vignemont 2012). At most, they show that bodily IEM is only\nde facto (Evans 1982).\n\nTo recapitulate, although the debate of IEM has mainly focused on the\nascription of mental states, the ascription of bodily properties\nraises three major questions: (i) Can bodily self-ascriptions be\nimmune to error, and if so, what are the appropriate grounds that\nsecure bodily IEM? (ii) Is bodily IEM of a different type from mental\nIEM? (iii) Does bodily IEM reveal the bodily nature of the self?\n",
