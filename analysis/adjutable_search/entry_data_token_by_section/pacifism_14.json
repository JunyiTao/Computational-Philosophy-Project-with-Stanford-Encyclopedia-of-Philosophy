    "main_text": "Deontological Pacifism\n4. Deontological Pacifism\n\nDeontological pacifism is closely related to absolute pacifism.\nDeontological approaches to morality focus on duty and right. One\ntypical idea for deontological pacifism is that there is a basic law\nor principle that prohibits killing, such as \u201cthou shall not\nkill.\u201d\n\nThe most famous theory of deontological ethics is Kant\u2019s.\nKant\u2019s categorical imperative is formulated as follows:\n\u201cAct according to that maxim by which you can at the same time\nwill that it should become a universal law\u201d (Kant 1990, 38). It\nis difficult to supply content to this imperative. Thus, it is not\nclear that the Kantian imperative can be used to rule out war. Indeed,\nKant is a defender of a version of the just war theory, in part\nbecause he believes that states have a duty to defend their citizens.\nAlthough Kant is not himself a pacifist, one might be able to ground\npacifism in Kant\u2019s alternative version of the moral law:\n\u201cAct so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or\nin that of another, always as an end and never as a means only\u201d\n(Kant 1990, 46). Some pacifists use the second formulation of the\ncategorical imperative to support their position by claiming that war\ntreats persons as means and does not respect them as ends in\nthemselves. One version of this idea has been defended by Soran\nReader, who argues that the basic presumption of the \u201cmoral\nstatus of persons\u201d leads to pacifism. Although Reader argues\nthat one can arrive at this perspective from both a consequentialist\napproach and a Kantian one, she relies on the basic intuition that\nrespect for persons as ends in themselves requires us not to kill\nthem. It is possible to use this deontological principle to support a\nmaximal extension of pacifism such that the prohibition against\nkilling might be extended to include a prohibition against killing\nnon-human persons. This interpretation would obviously require a\nfurther analysis of the notion of personhood. Another version of\ndeontological pacifism has been defended by Robert Holmes who claims\nthat morality, properly speaking, focuses on individuals, while war\nfocuses on defending collectives, which are not the proper focal point\nof morality (Holmes 2017b).\n\nIn addition to killing human persons, war violates the moral status of\npersons when, for example, soldiers are viewed as interchangeable cogs\nin the war machine. One might then criticize the apparent \u201cherd\nmentality\u201d of militarism, as Albert Einstein did when he called\nthe militaristic patriotism of the masses a sort of \u201cloathsome\nnonsense\u201d (Einstein 1954, 8) The idea of conscription seems to\nrun counter to the idea of respect for persons. And pacifists may\nargue that it is somehow disrespectful to require soldiers to conform\nto military virtues such as obedience to authority. Arguments against\nmilitarism along these lines were made famous by Thoreau who claimed\nthat in military service \u201cthe mass of men serve the State thus,\nnot as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies\u201d (Thoreau\n2000, 669)\n\nThe more important critique of the way that war betrays human dignity\ncan be found in the pacifist critique of the killing that happens in\nwar. Pacifists might claim that war is a violation of human rights.\nMore concretely the pacifist may claim that all human beings have a\nright to life and that killing in war violates this right.\n\nThis idea has been rejected by Anscombe, Narveson, and others who\nargue that the idea of human dignity or human rights can necessitate\nthe use of violence in defense of these rights. This sort of objection\nholds that it is both inconsistent and immoral for pacifists to reject\nthe use of violence in defense of human rights. As David Luban puts\nthis: \u201cSuch rights are worth fighting for. They are worth\nfighting for not only by those to whom they are denied but, if we take\nseriously the obligation which is indicated when we speak of human\nrights, by the rest of us as well\u201d (Luban 1980, 170).\n\nOne of the ways that pacifists can reply to this objection is to\nemphasize the difference between personal nonviolence and war.\nPacifists may accept that personal self-defense is acceptable; and\nthey may accept the idea of using violence in defense of the innocent\nin concrete personal encounters. (Of course, absolute pacifists who\nemphasized complete nonresistance will not accept such violence at\nall). But pacifism as anti-warism will argue that the violence of war\nis of a different kind. War is dehumanizing violence that kills masses\nof persons without any concern for them as persons. Along these lines,\nThomas Nagel claims that we should be able to justify to the victim\nwhat is being done to them, in light of morally relevant facts about\nthem. At the level of personal violence, it is possible to say that an\naggressor deserves the violence that is inflicted upon him. But at the\nlevel of war, this personal element is lost and instead we have\nkilling en masse, which is an assault on human dignity.\n",
