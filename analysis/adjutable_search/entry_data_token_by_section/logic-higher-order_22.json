    "main_text": "Second-Order Arithmetic\n14. Second-Order Arithmetic\n\nOwing to the central role that real numbers play in mathematics, the\nsecond-order theory of natural numbers, known as second-order\narithmetic (Simpson 1999 [2009]), and denoted \\(Z_2\\), is an\nimportant foundational theory. It is stronger than (first order) Peano\narithmetic but weaker than set theory. It has variables for\nindividuals thought of as natural numbers as well as variables for\nsets of natural numbers thought of as real numbers. In addition there\nare \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\) for arithmetic operations on the individuals.\nAs axioms \\(Z_2\\) has some rather obvious axioms about \\(+\\) and\n\\(\\times\\), the Induction Axiom (\\ref{ind}), and the axioms of\nsecond-order logic, including the Comprehension Principles (\\ref{CA}).\nA surprising amount of mathematics can be derived in \\(Z_2\\). We refer\nto Simpson (1999 [2009]) for details. In a sense, \\(Z_2\\) is a great\nsuccess story for second-order logic.\n\nReverse mathematics uses \\(Z_2\\) to isolate the exact axioms\non which well-known theorems from mathematics rely. In a textbook such\ntheorems are proved perhaps in an informal set theory, but how much\nset theory is actually needed in each case? For example, we may ask\nwhat is the weakest set of axioms from which the Bolzano-Weierstrass\n Theorem[21]\n can be proved? How much set theory, comprehension, choice, induction,\netc is needed? Since \\(Z_2\\) is a natural and sufficient environment\nfor many mathematical theorems, it is an appropriate framework for\nanswering questions raised by the reverse mathematics program. The\nmain (but not the only) distinctions that are made in reverse\nmathematics concern the amount of the Comprehension Principle that is\nneeded in proving this or that mathematical result. In particular, the\nrole of Arithmetic and \\(\\Pi^1_1\\)-Comprehension Principles is\nclarified. The basic theory of real numbers can be developed on the\nbasis of Arithmetic Comprehension only, but proofs relying on the\nnotion of a countable ordinal require the \\(\\Pi^1_1\\)-Comprehension\nPrinciple. Again, we refer to Simpson (1999 [2009]) for details.\n\n",
