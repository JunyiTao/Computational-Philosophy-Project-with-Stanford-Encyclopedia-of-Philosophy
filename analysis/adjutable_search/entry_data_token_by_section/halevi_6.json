The Problem of Creation vs. the Eternity of the World\n\n\nWhile the sage fully appreciates that the Khazar\nking's principal concern is to learn what actions are pleasing\nand displeasing, he also recognizes that the king has been perplexed\nand preoccupied from the beginning with the claim that God created the\nworld out of nothing in six days. The discussion of the divine order\nand of what the attributes of the undisputed prophet are made it clear\nthat knowledge of hidden things in both the past and future was one\nsuch attribute. So it is that in the course of responding to a query\nabout the reliability of the Bible's chronology, the sage\naddresses himself to several of the reasons for the king's\nperplexity about creation, and he does so in unexpected ways. First, he\nflatly dismisses claims about the great antiquity of certain monuments\nin India that allegedly refute the Bible's chronology and of\ncertain records that name people who lived before Adam. He argues that\nthese claims are unconfirmed and that the uneducated multitude which\naccepts such things is wayward and unreliable. It is precisely because\nthe multitude lacks both well established beliefs and an agreed-upon\nchronology, such as the Jews possess, that they succumb so easily to\ncredulousness.\n\n\nWhen the sage is reminded, however, that the philosophers\nbelieve in the past-eternity of the world and support their claims by\nscrupulous investigation, the sage rejects the philosopher's view\nof the past-eternity of the world as well. However, he also excuses the\nphilosophers for being mistaken because their lineage and geographical\nenvironment have left them poorly equipped to receive or acquire, not\nto mention preserve and transmit, reliable information on the matter.\nAs Greeks, they were descendents of Yaphet rather than Shem, which\nmeans that they lacked knowledge confirmed by a divine order (i.e., a\nprophetic experience apprehended by the divine faculty that sees things\nas they really are). Accordingly, they could only speculate about the\nmatter. In addition, the variability and instability of the northern\nclimates contributed to the destruction or loss of what knowledge they\ndid have. The opposite holds true for the descendents of Shem and the\nregion that was their home. Having no special claim to credibility,\nAristotle's view should not be accepted. In fact, the arguments\nfor the two positions turn out to be evenly balanced against each other\nand are therefore inconclusive. In the end, Aristotle preferred the\nidea of the world's past-eternity because of an essentially\ncultural predilection for the abstract argumentation supporting it and,\nof course, because he lacked a reliable tradition supporting the\ncontrary view. Having no such tradition of his own, he never even\nthought to ask others about theirs. Had he lived within a nation that\npossessed such a tradition, like Israel's own, Halevi contends\nthat he would certainly have argued for the\npossibility of creation, for, as the sage\npoints out most emphatically in an oath, the Torah teaches nothing that\ndirectly contradicts the clear evidence of sense experience or the\nconclusion of a genuine demonstration. Halevi does not spell out why he\nthinks Aristotle would have decided to argue for the opposing view, but\nit seems to have some connection with the status and function of oaths,\nwhich calls for further reflection. In any event, even if it were\neventually proven that matter is eternal into the past and many worlds\npreceded this one, an adherent of the Law would still be able to\nmaintain that traditions about the temporal origin of\nthis world and its earliest\ninhabitants remain intact and his faith unimpaired.\n",
