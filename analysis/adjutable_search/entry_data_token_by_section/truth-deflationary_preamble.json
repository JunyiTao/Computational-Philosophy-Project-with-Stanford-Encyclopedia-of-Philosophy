    "main_text": "\n\nDeflationism about truth, what is often simply called\n\u201cdeflationism\u201d, is really not so much a theory of\ntruth in the traditional sense, as it is a different, newer sort\nof approach to the topic. Traditional theories of truth are part of a\nphilosophical debate about the nature of a supposed property of truth.\nPhilosophers offering such theories often make suggestions like the\nfollowing: truth consists in correspondence to the facts; truth\nconsists in coherence with a set of beliefs or propositions; truth is\nwhat is acceptable in the ideal limit of inquiry. According to\ndeflationists, such suggestions are mistaken, and, moreover, they all\nshare a common mistake. The common mistake is to assume that truth\nhas a nature of the kind that philosophers might find out\nabout and develop theories of. The main idea of the deflationary\napproach is (a) that all that can be significantly said about truth is\nexhausted by an account of the role of the expression\n\u2018true\u2019 or of the concept of truth in our talk and thought,\nand (b) that, by contrast with what traditional views assume, this\nrole is neither metaphysically substantive nor explanatory. For\nexample, according to deflationary accounts, to say that \u2018snow\nis white\u2019 is true, or that it is true that snow is white, is in\nsome sense strongly equivalent to saying simply that snow is white,\nand this, according to the deflationary approach, is all that can be\nsaid significantly about the truth of \u2018snow is white\u2019.\nPhilosophers looking for some underlying nature of some truth property\nthat is attributed with the use of the expression \u2018true\u2019\nare bound to be frustrated, the deflationist says, because they are\nlooking for something that isn\u2019t there.\n\nDeflationism comprises a variety of different versions, each of which\nhave gone by different names, including at least the following:\ndisquotationalism, minimalism, prosententialism, the redundancy\ntheory, the disappearance theory, the no-truth theory. There has not\nalways been terminological consensus in the literature about how to\nuse these labels: sometimes they have been used interchangeably;\nsometimes they have been used to mark distinctions between different\ndevelopments of the same general approach. The actual variety of\ndeflationary views has not always been clear in discussions of this\napproach, especially in the earlier literature, where important\ndifferences are occasionally missed. To help clear this up, we will\nuse \u2018deflationism\u2019 to denote the general approach we want\nto discuss and reserve other names for specific versions of that\napproach.\n",
