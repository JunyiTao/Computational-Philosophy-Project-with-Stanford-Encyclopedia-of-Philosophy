    "main_text": "Issues\n1. Issues\n\nEuclid defined a boundary as \u201cthat which is an extremity of\nanything\u201d (Elements, I, def. 13). Aristotle defined the\nextremity of a thing as \u201cthe first thing beyond which it is not\npossible to find any part [of the given thing], and the first within\nwhich every part is\u201d (Metaphysics, V, 1022a4\u20135).\nTogether, these two definitions deliver the classic account of\nboundaries, an account that is both intuitive and comprehensive and\noffers the natural starting point for any further investigation into\nthe boundary concept. Indeed, although Aristotle\u2019s definition\nconcerned primarily the extremities of spatial entities, it applies\nequally well in the temporal domain. Just as the Mason-Dixon line\nmarks the boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania insofar as no\npart of Maryland can be found on the northern side of the line, and no\npart of Pennsylvania on its southern side, so \u201cthe now is an\nextremity of the past (no part of the future being on this side of\nit), and again of the future (no part of the past being on that side\nof it)\u201d (Physics, VI, 233b35\u2013234a2). Similarly\nfor concrete objects and events: just as the surface of an apple marks\nits spatial boundary insofar as the apple extends only up to it, so\nthe referee\u2019s whistle marks the temporal boundary of the game\ninsofar as the game protracts only up to it. In the case of abstract\nentities, such as concepts and sets, the account is perhaps adequate\nonly figuratively. Still, it is telling that one of the Greek words\nfor \u2018boundary\u2019, \u1f45\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, is also a\nword for \u2018definition\u2019: as John of Damascus nicely put it,\n\u201cdefinition is the term for the setting of land boundaries taken\nin a metaphorical sense\u201d (The Fount of Knowledge, I,\n8). Likewise, it is telling that in point-set topology the standard\ndefinition of a set\u2019s boundary (from Hausdorff 1914, \u00a77.2)\nreflects essentially the same intuition: the boundary, or frontier, of\na set A is the set of those points all of whose neighborhoods\nintersect both A and the complement of A (where a\nneighborhood of a point p is, intuitively, a set of points\nthat entirely \u201csurround\u201d p). It is not an\nexaggeration, therefore, to say that the Euclidean-Aristotelian\ncharacterization captures a general intuition about boundaries that\napplies across the board. Nonetheless, precisely this intuitive\ncharacterization gives rise to several puzzles that justify\nphilosophical concern.\n",
