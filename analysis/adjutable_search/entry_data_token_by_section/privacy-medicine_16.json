    "main_text": "Decisional Privacy || Conscientious Refusal of Medical Services\n5.3 Conscientious Refusal of Medical Services by Professionals\n\nIn most countries, the public relies on licensed physicians and\nhospitals for medical care. The medicines physicians recommend are\navailable only from professionally trained, licensed pharmacists. In\nthe U.S., state and federal laws have been enacted to relieve health\ncare providers of the obligation to perform medical services that\noffend their philosophical, moral, or religious beliefs. Some\npolicy-makers have argued that health care practitioners should be\nfree to decline to provide services for which they are professionally\ntrained if doing so genuinely violates personal conscience (Dresser\n2005). Defenders of what have been called \u201cconscience\nclauses\u201d and \u201crefusal laws\u201d see themselves as\ndefending the \u201cprivacy\u201d of pharmacists and health care\nproviders, privacy akin to liberty of thought and freedom of religion\n(White 1999). But opponents of such laws see themselves as the true\ndefenders of privacy, standing up for the \u201cright to\nprivacy\u201d of patients. They stress that the call for refusal laws\nhas been tied to larger \u201cpro life\u201d strategies to limit\naccess to contraceptives, medical abortifacients and surgical\nabortions. They say pharmacists who decline to dispense medication are\nplacing their personal values and autonomy above the values and\nautonomy of patients. Furthermore, pharmacists, like physicians and\nnurses, enjoy the benefits of regulation and have chosen their\nprofessions voluntarily. Private reproductive choices can be exercised\nonly if sufficient numbers of health care professionals are willing to\nperform lawful services.\n\nShould health care workers be required to dispense medications and\nperform procedures that violate their personal scruples? Most\nbioethicists agree that in the context of emergency medicine,\nconscientious refusal has no place. A physician should not refuse to\nterminate an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy threatening the life of the\nmother, for example. There is significant disagreement, however, about\nwhether morally-based refusal is warranted by retail pharmacists. An\nethical code promulgated by a pharmacists association arguably places\npatients\u2019 need and social justice above the personal convictions\nof individual pharmacists (APHA 1994). Whether pharmacists can\nethically refuse may depend upon the proximity of other pharmacists\nwilling to serve in their places. Ethicists also disagree about\nwhether physicians may use their scruples as rationales for refusing\nto answer medical questions or refer patients to abortion providers. A\nfurther, related, question is whether physicians in countries where\nabortion is safe and legal may ethically follow their public or\nprivate employers\u2019 orders to refrain from providing information\nabout abortion services to patients.\n",
