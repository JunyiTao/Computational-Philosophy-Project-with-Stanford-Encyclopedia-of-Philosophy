    "main_text": "Applications of temporal logics || Temporal logics in Artificial Intelligence\n11.3 Temporal logics in Linguistics\n\nTense is an important feature of natural languages. It is a linguistic\ndevice that allows one to specify the relative location of events in\ntime, usually with respect to the speech time. In most languages,\nincluding English, tense becomes manifest in a system of different\nverbal tenses. English allows for a distinction between past, present,\nand future tense (\u2018will\u2019 future) and, traditionally, the\nrespective perfect and progressive forms are referred to as tenses as\nwell.\n\nAs laid out above, Prior\u2019s invention of tense logic was largely\nmotivated by the use of tense in natural language. An alternative\nearly logical approach to tense was provided by Reichenbach (1947),\nwho suggested an analysis of the English verbal tenses in terms of\nthree points in time: speech time, event time, and reference time,\nwhere the reference time is a contextually salient point in time,\nwhich, intuitively, captures the perspective from which the event is\nviewed. Using the notion of reference time, Reichenbach was able to\ndistinguish, for example, between the simple past (\u201cI wrote a\nletter\u201d) and the present perfect (\u201cI have written a\nletter\u201d), which are conflated in Prior\u2019s account. In both\ncases, of simple past and of present perfect, the event time precedes\nthe speech time; but, in the former case the reference time coincides\nwith the event time whereas in the latter case the reference time is\nsimultaneous with the speech time.\n\nNeither Prior\u2019s nor Reichenbach\u2019s frameworks can account\nfor the difference between, for instance, the simple past (\u201cI\nwrote a letter\u201d) and the past progressive (\u201cI was writing\na letter\u201d). The relevant distinction here is one of aspect\nrather than of tense and naturally requires an interval-based or\nevent-based setting to be adequately dealt with. For accounts along\nthese lines, see e.g. Dowty (1979); Parsons (1980); Galton (1984); and\nvan Lambalgen and Hamm (2005).\n\nWhereas Reichenbach\u2019s analysis makes reference to a contextually\nsalient point in time, on Prior\u2019s account tenses are construed\nas temporal operators, which are interpreted as quantifiers over\ninstants in time. This raises the general question: are tenses in\nnatural language to be treated as quantifiers, or do they refer to\nspecific points in time? In an influential paper, Partee (1973)\nprovided the following counterexample against a quantifier treatment\nof tenses: the sentence \u201cI didn\u2019t turn off the\nstove\u201d means neither (1) there is an earlier time instant at\nwhich I do not turn off the stove, nor does it mean (2) there is no\nearlier instant at which I turn off the stove. The first requirement\nis too weak, the second too strong. Partee suggested an analogy\nbetween tenses and referential pronouns. According to this proposal,\ntenses refer to specific, contextually given points in time (e.g. 8\no\u2019clock this morning), which are presupposed to stand in\nappropriate temporal relations to the speech time. Subsequently,\naccounts that restrict quantification to a contextually given time\ninterval (e.g. this morning) have become popular. On these accounts,\nPartee\u2019s example sentence has the intuitive meaning: there is no\nearlier time instant in the contextually salient time interval at\nwhich I turn off the stove. Formally, this idea is compatible with\nboth a quantifier and a referential treatment of tenses; for details\nsee Kuhn and Portner (2002) and Ogihara (2011).\n\nOther pertinent issues in linguistics relating to time concern the\nmeaning of temporal adverbs and connectives, the interaction of tense\nand quantification, the interpretation of embedded tenses and sequence\nof tense, as well as the interrelation of tense and modality. For an\noverview and further discussion on the application of temporal logics\nin linguistics, see e.g. Steedman (1997); Kuhn and Portner (2002);\nMani et al. (2005); ter Meulen (2005); Moss and Tiede (2006); Ogihara\n(2007; 2011); Dyke (2013); and the entry on\n tense and aspect.\n",
