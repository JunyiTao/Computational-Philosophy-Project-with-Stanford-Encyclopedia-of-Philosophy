    "main_text": "Perception || Perception as producing knowledge\n4.1 Perception as producing knowledge\n\nThe processes of production of sensory awarness vary with modality and\nwith the type of thing perceived, earthen, watery, etc., universal or\nparticular, a group of things, something external or internal, and in\nways peculiar to perceivers. Neverthelesss, there are commonalities,\nespecially when it comes to the questions of epistemology, most\nprominently that innumerable instances of knowledge are sensorily\nproduced. But awareness produced by the senses is not how\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba defines perceptual knowledge. If what was\nconsidered an instance of knowledge is discovered to be in fact a\nfalse belief, then we say in English that there was no knowledge in\nthe first place, only a belief that was considered true and warranted.\nThe same logic holds for Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s\n\u2018pratyak\u1e63a\u2019: if what was considered a\nperceptual awareness is discovered to be in fact non-veridical, then\nit is said that there was no perception in the first place, only an\nawareness that was considered veridical and produced by an organ of\nsense.\n\nThus there may be here only a verbal unity achieved cheaply, but it is\nimportant to know that Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba works with this\nunderstanding of the term. Perhaps this is why he spends section after\nsection in his \u201cperception\u201d chapter examining particular\nproblems with objects known such as air, the sound of one\u2019s own\nson\u2019s voice in a \u201ctumultuous racket,\u201d universals and\nthe types of sensory relation occurrent in knowledge thereof, apparent\nsimultaneous perception, and perception of perception itself. His\nchapter is full of phenomenological insights, but the science he\nrelies on to understand the operations of the several sense organs is\nobviously antiquated. Epistemologically, however, the goal is to\nseparate the pseudo-source that generates non-knowledge (awareness\nthat appears to to be true but is not or is not produced in the\nassumed way) from the genuine, and the science is often not relevant\nconsidering the signs of knowledge and non-knowledge. The longest\nsection of the chapter is devoted to a general account of illusion as\n\u201cappearance of something as other than as it is,\u201d\nanyath\u0101-khy\u0101ti-v\u0101da.\n\nIn illusion, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba says, the presentation of\nF-hood\u2014silverhood, for example, in the illusion of\n\u201cseeing\u201d a piece of shell as silver, and saying,\n\u201cSilver,\u201d when it\u2019s really\nmother-of-pearl\u2014originates in things\u2019 really being F,\nthrough previous knowledge of F-hood, real bits of silver in the\nworld. The silverhood predication in the verbalization of the\nperception-like experience is available to become illusory predication\ncontent through previous experience of silver. It gets fused into a\ncurrent perception-like event by means of a foul-up in the normal\ncausal process through the arousing of a silverhood memory-disposition\n(sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) formed by previous experience of\nsilver, or, possibly, by testimony. The content or intentionality of\nan illusion is to be explained causally as generated by real features\nof real things just as is genuine perception although they are\ndistinct cognitive types. To repeat, genuine perception is factive;\nillusion is a perception-imitator (\u201cYou don\u2019t really see\nMaitra because that\u2019s Chaitra\u201d).\n\nPerception gets content not only from the object in connection with\nthe sense organ but also from the classificational power of the mind\nor self. With the perceptual awareness, \u201cThat\u2019s a\npot,\u201d for instance, the pot as an individual in connection with\na sensory faculty is responsible for the cognition of a\nproperty-bearer, for what is called the qualificandum portion of the\nperception, without admixture of memory, but the sensory connection is\nnot by itself responsible for the qualifier portion, the pothood, also\nidentified as the \u201cpredication content\u201d\n(prak\u0101ra, the verbalizable \u201cway\u201d something\nappears), the thing\u2019s classification as a pot. The\nclassificational power of the mind should not, however, be understood\nas innate so much as the product of experience over the course of a\nlifetime. Repeatable features of reality get impressed on the mind or\nself in the form of memory dispositions. That is, in perceiving\na as an F, normally an F-sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra formed\nby previous knowledge-source-produced bits of awareness of things F\nwould be a causal factor. The perception\u2019s own content includes\nthe repeatable nature of the qualifier through the operation of this\nfactor. We see the tree as a tree, and it is a tree in fact.\n",
