    "main_text": "Pragmatics || Presupposition\n2.1 Presupposition\n\nA sentence such as\n\n(4)\nKepler died in misery.\n\n\nis not true unless the singular term \u2018Kepler\u2019 has\nreference. Still, Frege argued that a speaker asserting that Kepler\ndied in misery, by means of (4) does not also assert that\n\u2018Kepler\u2019 has reference (Frege 1892 [TPW: 69]). That Kepler\nhas reference is not part of the sense of the sentence. Frege\u2019s\nreason was that if it had been, the sense of its negation\n\n(5)\nKepler did not die in misery.\n\n\nwould have been that Kepler did not die in misery or\n\u2018Kepler\u2019 does not have reference, which is absurd.\nAccording to Frege, that \u2018Kepler\u2019 has reference is rather\npresupposed, both in an assertion of\n (4)\n and in an assertion of its negation.\n\nThe modern treatment of presupposition has followed Frege in treating\nsurvival under negation as the most important test for presupposition.\nThat is, if it is implied that p, both in an assertion of a\nsentence s and in an assertion of the negation of s,\nthen it is presupposed that p in those assertions (unless\nthat p is entailed by all sentences). Other typical examples\nof presupposition (Levinson 1983: 178\u2013181) include\n\n(6)\nJohn managed [didn\u2019t manage] to stop in time.\n\n\nimplying that John tried to stop in time, and\n\n(7)\nMartha regrets [doesn\u2019t regret] drinking John\u2019s home\nbrew.\n\n\nimplying that Martha drank John\u2019s home brew.\n\nIn the case of\n (4),\n the presupposition is clearly of a semantic nature, since the\nsentence \u201cSomeone is identical with Kepler\u201d, which is true\njust if \u2018Kepler\u2019 has reference, is a logical consequence\nof\n (4)\n and (under a standard interpretation) of (5). By contrast, in the\nnegated forms of\n (6)\n and\n (7),\n the presupposition can be canceled by context, e.g., as in\n\n(8)\nJohn didn\u2019t manage to stop in time. He didn\u2019t even\ntry.\n\n\nThis indicates that in this case the presupposition is rather a\npragmatic phenomenon; it is the speaker or speech act rather than the\nsentence or the proposition expressed that presupposes something.\n\nHowever, the issue of separating semantic from pragmatic aspects of\npresupposition is complex, and regarded differently in different\napproaches to presupposition (for an overview, see Simons\n 2006).[6]\n",
