    "main_text": "Theories of Adjudication || Adjudication in Political Economy\n5.1 Adjudication in Political Economy\n\nAs noted earlier, the political economy strand of economic analysis of\nlaw itself contains two strands that are in tension with each other.\nOn the one hand, the radical political economy strand seeks only to\nexplain legal phenomena rather than to prescribe either the structure\nof legal institutions or the content of particular legal rules. One\nmight find within this strand of political economy a positive theory\nof adjudication but not a normative theory. Indeed, the positive\ntheory advanced argues that judges seek to promote their interests.\nUsually, these interests are defined as policy interests, that is, an\ninterest to promote particular policies.\n\nThe second strand of political economy, constitutional political\neconomy, does have normative aims. It assumes that political\nactors will act in a self-interested fashion within existing\npolitical institutions but that agents will act more impartially in\nthe design of the political institutions within which they\nwill\n work.[24]\n A normative theory of adjudication does emerge from this strand of\npolitical economy, but it differs significantly from the normative\ntheory endorsed by the policy analysis strand of economic analysis of\nlaw. For constitutional political economy, a normative theory of\nadjudication must be a structural one; it should describe the\nstructure of adjudication. The theory thus cannot dictate directly\njudicial motivation because, according to political economy, judges\nwill always act self-interestedly. Adjudicative institutions, however,\ncan be designed to align better the interests of judges with the\ninterests of the designer of the constitution.\n\nIn 1975, Landes and Posner offered a justification for the\nindependence of the judiciary that is often understood as a normative\ntheory of adjudication within the tradition of constitutional\npolitical economy. On the account of Landes and Posner, an independent\njudiciary serves the interest of legislators who seek to impose their\npolicies on the jurisdiction for periods that exceed the length of\ntheir majority in the legislature. As a consequence, they find it in\ntheir interest to have the judiciary enforce the original bargain\nstruck in all legislation.\n\nThis argument contains a normative theory of statutory interpretation.\nJudges ought to enforce the bargains reached by the legislature that\nenacted the statute. On this account, a judge ignores the views of the\ncurrent legislative majority. She also eschews interpretation of the\nstatute in terms of her own policy preferences.\n\nOne should note that, from the perspective of constitutional political\neconomy, the argument of Landes and Posner is incomplete. They ground\ntheir theory of judicial independence in the interests of legislators.\nThe interests of legislators within extant legislative institutions\nmay not coincide with the interests of the constitutional\ndesigner.\n",
