    "main_text": "Two Conceptions of Moral Principles\n1. Two Conceptions of Moral Principles\n\n\nIf we are going to debate the question whether there is a need for\nmoral principles, we need some idea of what we mean by a \u2018moral\nprinciple\u2019. Unfortunately there are two radically different\nconceptions of what moral principles are. The first conception, the\n\u2018absolute\u2019 conception, takes a moral principle to be a\nuniversal claim to the effect that all actions of a certain type are\noverall wrong (or right).  The principle \u2018don\u2019t break your\npromises\u2019can be expressed in various ways: \u2018it is wrong to\nbreak one\u2019s promises\u2019; \u2018all actions that involve breaking a\npromise are wrong\u2019\u2014and so on. On the absolute conception,\nthese all mean that each and every action of breaking a promise is a\nwrong action, whatever else there may be to be said for it. Each such\naction is wrong overall, despite any redeeming features it may\nhave.\n\n\nThere is a very different way of understanding a moral principle, as\n\u2018contributory\u2019 rather than as absolute. Understood in this\nsecond way, our principle maintains that if an action involves\nbreaking a promise, that counts against it. The action is the worse\nfor being a promise-breaking. Of course it may be the worse for being\na promise-breaking but the better for some other feature that it\nhas\u2014that of being kindly meant, say. The contributory conception\nof moral principles allows that more than one principle can apply to\nthe case before us, since it holds that each principle is, as it were,\npartial; each specifies how things are only in a certain respect. But\nactions have many relevant features, some counting in favour and\nothers against. Whether the action is overall right or wrong can only\nbe determined by the overall balance of right and wrong in it. The\ncontributory principles do not themselves tell us how to determine\nthat balance. They only specify contributions one by one, and leave us\nto work out how these add up. Some people suppose that the principles\ncan themselves be ranked in order of importance; if that were right,\nit would be of some help to us in working out what matters most in a\ngiven case. Others suppose that there is no available lexical ordering\nof such a sort, and that the matter is left to unaided\n\u2018judgement\u2019.\n\n\nSince there are these two quite different conceptions of what a\nmoral principle says, our discussion will need to address both\npossibilities. If particularism is true, there is not much room for\nmoral principles of either sort.\n",
