    "main_text": "\n\nFormal epistemology explores knowledge and reasoning using\n\u201cformal\u201d tools, tools from math and logic. For example, a\nformal epistemologist might use probability theory to explain how\nscientific reasoning works. Or she might use modal logic to defend a\nparticular theory of knowledge.\n\nThe questions that drive formal epistemology are often the same as\nthose that drive \u201cinformal\u201d epistemology. What is\nknowledge, and how is it different from mere opinion? What separates\nscience from pseudoscience? When is a belief justified? What justifies\nmy belief that the sun will rise tomorrow, or that the external world\nis real and not an illusion induced by Descartes\u2019 demon?\n\nAnd yet, the tools formal epistemologists apply to these questions\nshare much history and interest with other fields, both inside and\noutside philosophy. So formal epistemologists often ask questions that\naren\u2019t part of the usual epistemological core, questions about\ndecision-making\n (\u00a75.1)\n or the meaning of hypothetical language\n (\u00a75.3),\n for example.\n\nPerhaps the best way to get a feel for formal epistemology is to look\nat concrete examples. We\u2019ll take a few classic epistemological\nquestions and look at popular formal approaches to them, to see what\nformal tools bring to the table. We\u2019ll also look at some\napplications of these formal methods outside epistemology.\n",
