This commentary not only offers\nan excellent account of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din views, including\nthe theory of the two truths, but also offers a sharp critique of many\nviews held by the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins. Vasubandhu based his\ncommentary on the Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 (The\nGreat Commentary), as the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins held their\nphilosophical positions according to the teachings of the\nMah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101. Consequently,\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins are often known as\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas.\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din\u2019s\n ontology[2]\n or the theory of the two truths makes two fundamental claims.\n\nthe claim that the ultimate reality consists of irreducible\nspatial units (e.g., atoms of the material category) and irreducible\ntemporal units (e.g., point-instant consciousnesses) of the five basic\ncategories, and\nthe claim that the conventional reality consists of reducible\nspatial wholes or temporal continua.\n\n\nTo put the matter straightforwardly, for the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins,\nwholes and continua are only conventionally real, whereas the atoms\nand point-instant consciousness are only ultimately real.\n",
