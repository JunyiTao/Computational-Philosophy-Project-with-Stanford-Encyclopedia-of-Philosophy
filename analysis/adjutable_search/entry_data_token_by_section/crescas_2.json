    "main_text": "His works || Passover Sermon\n2.2  Passover Sermon\nIn this short book, which is a based on a sermon that Crescas\nprobably gave on the night of Passover, he explores his opinion about\nsome philosophical questions regarding the subject of the basis of\nbelief in \n miracles.[5]\n These questions arise because of the description\nof the different miracles experienced by the Jews in Egypt. The first\nquestion asksif belief is an act of free will, or if the miracle in\nfact obliges the believer to believe in it (and in the idea that the\nmiracle worker wants to prove through the miracle). After this\nquestion, Crescas addresses the subject of the essence of miracles,\nthe essence of free will, and the relation between free will and\nreward and punishment. The sermon\u2019s conclusion is also the only\nlegalist work of Crescas in our possession.\n\n\nIn this book, Crescas deals with the subject of free will in a less\nprofound manner than in his philosophical magnus opum Or\nHashem, but his opinions here do not contradict his opinion in\nOr Hashem. The difference between the two books on this\nsubject can be attributed to the development of the thought of\nCrescas.  According to one view, the sermon represents an anterior\nstage of Crescas and Or Hashem a posterior one (Sermon on\nthe Passover, pp. 34\u201368).  Another explanation of these\ndifferences could be the difference of style between the two books (a\nsermon versus a profound philosophical tract). The difference between\nthe two books is clearer with regard to the question of the essence of\nmiracles.  Crescas\u2019s opinion in his sermon is that miracles by\nthemselves don\u2019t oblige people to believe in something (as opposed to\nrational proofs that oblige belief). The reason for inherent doubt in\nthe validity of any given miracle is that the people cannot be sure\nthat God and not a human is the author of the miracle. In Or\nHashem (P. 312) Crescas asserts the opposite position. Humans\ncannot do miracles by\n themselves.[6]\nThis is\nthe reason that Crescas claims that the miracle is the best way to\nverify if a prophet is a true one or an\n impostor.[7]\nThis difference between the two works is a very good\nargument for the opinion that the sermon is anterior to Or\nHashem. Ravitzky has said that in the sermon, Crescas followed the\nideas of Rabbi Nissim Girondi, his teacher who believed in the\npossibility of men performing miracles, while years later, in Or\nHashem, Crescas retreated from this opinion and now held that only\nGod could perform miracles.\n",
