    "main_text": "Motivations || Truth, properties and sets\n1.1 Truth, properties and sets\nTheories of truth and predication are closely related to theories of\n properties and\n property attribution. To say that an open formula \\(\\phi(x)\\)\nis true of an individual \\(a\\) seems equivalent (in some sense)\nto the claim that \\(a\\) has the property of\nbeing such that \\(\\phi\\) (this property is signified by the open formula).\nFor example, one might say that \u2018\\(x\\) is a poor philosopher\u2019 is true\nof Tom instead of saying that Tom has the property of being a poor philosopher.\nQuantification over definable properties can then be mimicked in a language\nwith a truth predicate by quantifying over formulas. Instead of saying, for\ninstance, that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exactly the same properties, one\nsays that exactly the same formulas are true of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The\nreduction of properties to truth works also to some extent for sets of\nindividuals.\nThere are also reductions in the other direction: Tarski (1935) has\nshown that certain second-order existence assumptions (e.g.,\ncomprehension axioms) may be utilized to define truth (see the entry\non Tarski\u2019s definition of\ntruth). The mathematical analysis of axiomatic theories of truth\nand second-order systems has exhibited many equivalences between these\nsecond-order existence assumptions and truth-theoretic\nassumptions.\nThese results show exactly what is required for defining a truth predicate\nthat satisfies certain axioms, thereby sharpening Tarski\u2019s insights into\ndefinability of truth. In particular, proof-theoretic equivalences described in\nSection 3.3 below make explicit to what extent a\nmetalanguage (or rather metatheory) has to be richer than the object language\nin order to be able to define a truth predicate.\nThe equivalence between second-order theories and truth theories also has\nbearing on traditional metaphysical topics. The reductions of second-order\ntheories (i.e., theories of properties or sets) to axiomatic theories of truth\nmay be conceived as forms of reductive nominalism, for they replace existence\nassumptions for sets or properties (e.g., comprehension axioms) by\nontologically innocuous assumptions, in the present case by assumptions on the\nbehaviour of the truth predicate.\n",
