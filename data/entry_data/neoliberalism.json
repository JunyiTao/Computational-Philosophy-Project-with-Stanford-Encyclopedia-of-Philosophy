    "main_text": "\n1. Explicating A Challenging Term\n\nFor many years, the term \u201cneoliberalism\u201d has been in\nsearch of a referent. Is neoliberalism an ideology that fetishizes the\nmarket? Or is it a political program aimed at establishing the rule of\nthe capitalist class? Is neoliberalism the enemy of the state? Or does\nit favor the state to sustain the conditions for competitive markets?\nRajesh Venugopal (2015: 166) has argued that neoliberalism\n\n\nis now widely acknowledged in the literature as a controversial,\nincoherent, and crisis-ridden term, even by many of its most\ninfluential deployers,\n\n\nsuch as Michel Foucault (2004 [2010]). Venugopal\u2019s assessment\nwas arguably apt just ten years ago.\n\nBut several recent book-length treatments of neoliberalism (Burgin\n2012; Biebricher 2018; Slobodian 2018; Whyte 2019) have helped give\nform to an arguably inchoate political concept. As Quinn Slobodian\nargues,\n\n\nin the last decade, extraordinary efforts have been made to\nhistoricize neoliberalism and its prescriptions for global governance,\nand to transform the \u201cpolitical swearword\u201d or\n\u201canti-liberal slogan\u201d into a subject of rigorous archival\nresearch. (2018: 3)\n\n\nAlong similar lines, Thomas Biebricher (2018: 8\u20139) argues that\nneoliberalism no longer faces greater analytic hurdles than other\npolitical positions like conservatism or socialism.\n\nIn light of this recent historical work, we are now in a position to\nunderstand neoliberalism as a distinctive political theory.\nNeoliberalism holds that a society\u2019s political and economic\ninstitutions should be robustly liberal and capitalist, but\nsupplemented by a constitutionally limited democracy and a modest\nwelfare state. Neoliberals endorse liberal rights and the free-market\neconomy to protect freedom and promote economic prosperity.\nNeoliberals are broadly democratic, but stress the limitations of\ndemocracy as much as its necessity. And while neoliberals typically\nthink government should provide social insurance and public goods,\nthey are skeptical of the regulatory state, extensive government\nspending, and government-led countercyclical policy. Thus,\nneoliberalism is no mere economic doctrine. According to Biebricher,\nneoliberalism\n\n\nexplicitly addresses the noneconomic preconditions of functioning\nmarkets and the interactive effects between markets and their\nsurroundings. (2018: 27)\n\n\nAnd neoliberals share\n\n\nthe problem of how to identify the factors indispensable to the\nmaintenance of functioning markets. (2018: 26)\n\n\nSlobodian argues that all neoliberals\n\n\nsaw the intellectual project as finding the right state and the right\nlaw to serve the market order. (2018: 87)\n\n\nNeoliberals thereby offer unique institutional prescriptions on\ndistinctive grounds. Importantly, then, neoliberalism as a\nphilosophical doctrine is not an attempt to suffuse institutions with\nthe idea of human agents as homo economicus, (Brown 2019).\nInstead, following Jessica Whyte (2019: 8), neoliberalism has a\nnormative dimension that goes beyond the economic, since neoliberals\nbelieved\n\n\nthat a functioning competitive market required an adequate moral and\nlegal foundation,\n\n\nsuch that the arguments for neoliberal institutions involved an appeal\nto normative principles (2019: 14, 233).\n\nWe can helpfully explicate neoliberalism by examining the political\nconcepts, principles, and policies shared by three twentieth century\npolitical economists: F. A. Hayek, Milton Friedman, and James\nBuchanan. While they were trained as economists, all three wrote in\npolitical theory, and Hayek and Buchanan did so extensively.\nIdentifying the common themes in their work provides an accurate and\nilluminating picture of neoliberalism as a philosophical doctrine.\n\nThese figures were selected in response to the aforementioned\nhistorical research on neoliberalism. Biebricher (2018: 2) identifies\nall three figures as neoliberals, though he also counts Europe-focused\n\u201cordoliberals\u201d, specifically Walter Eucken, Wilhelm\nR\u00f6pke, and Alexander Rustow, as neoliberals. Slobodian (2018:\n268) identifies Friedman, Hayek, and Buchanan as neoliberals, though\nhe also includes the arguably libertarian Ludwig von\n Mises,[1]\n and a long litany of ordoliberals; he also focuses his analysis on\nwhat he calls \u201cGeneva school neoliberalism\u201d, where a great\ndeal of neoliberal thought about global institutions was\n focused.[2]\n Whyte (2019: 31) focuses more on Hayek and Friedman than Buchanan,\nbut she includes them in a larger cast of characters. So, while Hayek,\nFriedman, and Buchanan are not the only neoliberals, they are central\nto the new historical analysis. And by focusing on their thought, we\nnot only ease the burden of analysis, but provide space to focus on\nneoliberal ideas as crafted by their most reflective and insightful\nproponents. Further, other neoliberals said much less about their\nphilosophical commitments, so we have less material to work with.\nPerhaps the relative silence of other neoliberals makes it harder to\njustify using Hayek, Friedman, and Buchanan to represent them, but\ntheir shared political alliances and policies demonstrate substantial\n overlap.[3]\n\nThis entry\u2019s approach to defining neoliberalism differs from\nthat of Biebricher, Slobodian, Whyte, and Brown (Brown 2019) in much\nthe same way as political theorists and philosophers differ from\nhistorians, and indeed how philosophers differ from political\ntheorists. Neoliberalism can be understood as a somewhat static\ndoctrine to provide a basis for evaluation, and that can later serve\nto explicate variations on the view. It is perhaps more natural to\ntreat neoliberalism as a dynamic system of ideas, as historians do,\nand even some political theorists. Nonetheless, a review of Hayek,\nFriedman, and Buchanan reveals a sufficiently static doctrine to count\nas a kind of political philosophy.\n\nThe use of the term \u201cneoliberalism\u201d in this entry does not\nfit all uses of the term. Thus, the goal is less to explain what\n\u201cneoliberalism\u201d really means in all its uses, but\nrather to proffer a meaning based on three criteria. First, the term\n\u201cneoliberalism\u201d should be used to denote a fairly coherent\nset of positions. Second, it should be used to capture the views of\nthose figures most often associated with the position. Finally, we\nshould focus on capturing the most serious and even-handed uses of the\nterm, such as by academic historians, rather than more popular and\npejorative uses of \u201cneoliberalism\u201d. This essay\u2019s\naccount of the meaning of the term satisfies all three criteria. It\nidentifies a coherent doctrine understood in light of the views of its\nproponents, and its use of the term overlaps with the more careful\nuses of the term by recent academic historians. We pursue all three\naims by locating common commitments in the thought of Hayek, Friedman,\nand Buchanan.\n2. Inadequate Descriptions\n\nIf we want to understand neoliberalism in terms of the ideas of those\ncommonly associated with it, and usages proposed by historians, we\nshould understand neoliberalism as a doctrine about how politics and\nthe economy should be organized. It is not a theory of justice or\nlegitimacy. Rather, neoliberals appeal to a plurality of moral\nconsiderations to justify their preferred institutions. We should also\navoid defining neoliberalism as fitting within any of the following\nfour categories. Neoliberalism should therefore not be identified as\n(\u00a72.1) an ethos or conception of the good life, (\u00a72.2) a\nschool of thought within utilitarianism, (\u00a72.3) a version of\nlibertarianism, or (\u00a72.4) an ideal theory.\n2.1 Neoliberalism as Ethos\n\nMany think that neoliberal societies put profit ahead of other central\nvalues. David Harvey, for instance, argues that\n\n\nneoliberalism values market exchange as \u201can ethic in itself,\ncapable of acting as a guide to all human action, and substituting for\nall previously held ethical beliefs\u201d. (2005: 3)\n\n\nGeorge Monbiot insists that neoliberalism\n\n\nsees competition as the defining characteristic of human relations. It\nredefines citizens as consumers. (2016)\n\n\nBrown (2019) agrees. Some say that neoliberalism is an ideology where\neveryone is supposed to focus on economic prosperity or economic\ngrowth. Others say that neoliberalism is an ethos of the firm that\nrejects corporate social responsibility, instead recommending that\nfirms focus solely on their bottom lines (Steger & Roy 2010:\n13).\n\nBut neoliberals instead advance a view about the design of social\ninstitutions, and not a particular ethos of social life. In fact, they\nhave rather little to say about how to live the good life. Instead,\nneoliberals argue that their defense of capitalism does not\nnecessitate profit seeking as a way of life and that markets do not\nproduce people with such an ethos. It is true that they think certain\nattitudes and values, such as an excessive focus on social justice,\nequality of outcomes, hostility to all pursuit of profit, can\nundermine the foundations of a free society. But that does not imply\nthat they embrace a consumerist ethos.\n\nTo illustrate, consider Friedman. Friedman holds that part of the case\nfor freedom is that we don\u2019t know what persons ought to value\nbecause no one really knows what the good life consists in; a free\nsociety is good because it allows people to experiment with different\nforms of life to answer those questions for themselves (Friedman 1987\n[2017: 185]). And while Friedman (1962a [2002: 133]) proclaimed that\ncorporations\u2019 first duty is to maximize profits for their\nshareholders and that public policy should ensure that the\nmaximization of profit works to the benefit of all, even he does not\nadvocate a particular account of what persons ought to value.\n\nHayek and Buchanan are even clearer in denying that the good life\nconsists in economic ends like wealth maximization. Buchanan (1991:\n343) emphasizes personal ethical responsibility, adhering to social\nnorms forbidding debt (1987: 456, 461), and following\n\u201cmoral-ethical rules or norms for behavior\u201d (1999: 451).\nHayek thinks social life in a free society requires that people follow\nan array of rules and norms that have nothing to do with profit\nseeking, since many of these rules are below our conscious thought\n(Hayek 1973). Surprisingly, both Hayek (1988: 135\u2013142) and G.\nBrennan and Buchanan (1985: 150) even think that free societies needed\npeople prepared to act based on fundamentally religious\nimpulses.\n\nAdmittedly, Friedman and Buchanan use homo economicus to\nunderstand much of human behavior. But Buchanan (Brennan and Buchanan\n1981: 81) understands homo economicus broadly; it could be\n\u201cseen to maximize almost anything at all\u201d, and so has no\ninherent commitment to, say, wealth maximization.\n2.2 Neoliberalism as a School of Thought within Utilitarianism\n\nSome theorists claim that \u201cclassical liberalism\u201d, a term\noften used to refer to our three neoliberals, is fundamentally\nutilitarian in its understanding of the basis for social order\n(Freeman 2011:\n 25).[4]\n However, Buchanan (1975) is an avowed contractarian and rejects\nutilitarianism because it requires aggregating personal values in ways\nBuchanan thinks impossible or inappropriate. While many characterize\nFriedman (1974a [2017: 72]) as a utilitarian, he says that \u201cI\nmyself have never accepted utilitarianism\u201d. Friedman\u2019s\ndefense of the free market as maximizing utility was never meant to\nimply that people lacked basic rights that might forbid utility\nmaximization in some cases. Friedman focuses on utility-based\nconsiderations because he thinks they have universal appeal. Hayek\n(1988: 69) not only rejects utilitarianism, he rejects the broader\nclass of consequentialist theories of social order: he rejects any\ndemand for justification where morality is grounded in its production\nof some particular goal, like happiness. Hayek (1978: 132) is better\ndescribed as a contractarian.\n2.3 Neoliberalism as Libertarianism\n\nNeoliberals are much friendlier to the nation-state than libertarians.\nSecond, libertarians often argue for institutional structures directly\nfrom a moral theory and a theory of justice, an approach taken by\nRobert Nozick (1974). In contrast, neoliberals seldom appeal to\nfleshed out theories of justice, such as a theory of natural rights,\neven if they appeal to the language of justice at various point. To\nfocus on the case of natural rights theories of justice, Buchanan does\nnot believe in them. He begins his treatise on political philosophy,\nThe Limits of Liberty, with the insistence that there is no\nmorality beyond what we agree to (Buchanan 1975: 1). Hayek barely\ncomments on natural rights, and Friedman discusses them primarily\nrhetorically. This is not to say that neoliberals reject deontic\nconstraints on the use of state power. Hayek and Buchanan\u2019s\ncontractarianisms forbid pursuing liberty and prosperity in ways that\nall cannot agree to. Neoliberals instead focus on the\nconsequence-based arguments for liberalism without adopting\nconsequentialism. They simply rationalize liberalism in part based on\nthe claim that liberalism has good consequences.\n\nOne is on better ground arguing that neoliberalism is a twentieth\ncentury revival of classical liberal ideas in response to certain\nunique twentieth century challenges. Neoliberalism arose in the late\n1940s as a response to three twentieth century ideologies that\nadvocated large states: communism (as the most prominent form of\nsocialism), fascism, and social democracy. Neoliberals sought to\nconfine state power to a range of functions much more limited than\nthat undertaken by extensive states of these three varieties.\nHayek\u2019s work on informational systems was a response to\ncommunist central planning. Friedman\u2019s monetarism was a response\nto Keynesian macroeconomic policy. And Buchanan\u2019s public-choice\nresearch program was a response to the economics of general\nequilibrium and market failure economics.\n2.4 Neoliberalism as Ideal Theory\n\nPhilosophers have come to understand ideal theory in a number of ways,\nbut we can follow John Rawls\u2019s (1971 [1999: 7\u20138,\n215\u20136, 308\u20139]) understanding of ideal theory as describing\nthe best social and political order in light of certain high-minded\naccounts of human capacities, behavior, and natural circumstances, in\nparticular a preparedness to comply with institutions that embody the\ncorrect conception of justice. Ideal theories of justice provide\naccounts of the \u201crealistic utopia\u201d that citizens should\nstrive for, a society where everyone acts as justice demands by fully\ncomplying with just institutional rules (Rawls 2001: 4, 13).\n\nNeoliberals reject both elements of political theorizing. First, they\ntend to reject theorizing about an ideal. This is because neoliberals\nare often skeptical about our ability acquire moral knowledge; there\nis an epistemic barrier to knowing what is truly right and good.\nAgain, Friedman repeatedly says that the case for a free society is\nthat we don\u2019t know \u201cwhat sin is\u201d and Hayek argues\nthat, given the limitations of our knowledge,\n\n\nIt is at least doubtful whether at this stage a detailed blueprint of\na desirable internal order of society would be of much use\u2014or\nwhether anyone is competent to furnish it. (1944 [2007: 237])\n\n\nHayek does not think that political philosophers invent societies;\nrather, neoliberals do not think they\u2019re in a position to\ndescribe how an ideal society would function.\n\nNow, importantly, Buchanan (1975: 91\u2013106) is a philosophical\nanarchist: \u201cThe ideal society is anarchy, in which no one man or\ngroup of men coerces another\u201d. And Friedman (1974a [2017: 87])\nthinks that it is \u201cdesirable to have a vision of the\nideal\u201d and seems to embrace libertarianism as that ideal.\nFurther, he may think that many of his favored welfare-state policies\nwould not be part of an ideal social order. Yet both Friedman and\nBuchanan think attempts to reach the ideal could backfire and so\npolitical economy should focus making marginal improvements to\ninstitutions. In this way, neoliberals sometimes have political\nideals, but it is not central to their politico-economic doctrine,\nthat is, to what they actually advocate.\n\nSecond, Hayek (1944 [2007: 157\u2013170]), Friedman (1962b [2017:\n23]), and Buchanan (Buchanan and Tullock 1962) all deny that we should\nassume that people will tend to comply with what justice and the law\nrequires. People go wrong, especially when they have too much\npower. As Friedman (1962b [2017: 23]) says, \u201cthe liberal\nconceives of men as imperfect beings\u201d and assumes that\norganizing society is as much about \u201cpreventing\n\u2018bad\u2019 people from doing harm\u201d as it is about helping\nothers do good. Buchanan\u2019s project is to theorize politics\n\u201cwithout romance\u201d and deny the feasibility of a\ncontractarian agreement on principles of justice. If anything,\ncompliance is an endogenous variable in their models of social order,\nwhere different sets of social rules will produce different levels of\ncompliance and are to be chosen in part on that basis. In brief,\ncompliance is never taken for granted. Their non-ideal theory\nis also associated with their opposition to socialisms of all kinds:\nsocialism is irresponsible ideal theory whose purported feasibility\nrests entirely on the illicit assumption that human nature can be\nmodified to make persons more rational and altruistic. Society will\nnot work as socialists predict.\n3. Liberalism\n\nHayek, Friedman, and Buchanan see themselves first and foremost as\ndefenders of individual freedom and the freedom of small groups such\nas the family. Liberty is usually construed negatively, as when Hayek\nsays that liberty is when \u201ccoercion of some by others is reduced\nas much as possible in society\u201d (1960 [2011: 11]). Coercion\noccurs\n\n\nwhen one man\u2019s actions are made to serve another man\u2019s\nwill, not for his own but for the other\u2019s purpose. (1960 [2011:\n133])\n\n\nWe keep coercive power in check by defining a private sphere of\nindividual activity and limiting state power (Caldwell 2004: 289).\nFriedman thinks similarly. His liberalism is understood as the embrace\nof\n\n\na government that is limited primarily to preserving a legal structure\nthat allows people to cooperate voluntarily in the marketplace, and\nwhose power is dispersed. (Butler 1985: 22)\n\n\nFor Friedman, Liberals\n\n\ntake the freedom of the individual, or perhaps the family, as our\nultimate goal in judging social arrangements. (Friedman 1962b [2017:\n22])\n\n\nAnd more directly: \u201cI define freedom as the absence of coercion\nof one person by another\u201d (1987 [2017: 185]).\n\nNeoliberals do not always embrace negative conceptions of liberty\nalone. Hayek\u2019s (1960 [2011: 11]) conception of freedom can be\ninterpreted as republican, as the view that one is free when she is\nfree from arbitrary interference, since Hayek repeatedly worries about\ngovernment engaging in arbitrary controls that prevent people from\ndeveloping long-term plans. This partly explains his insistence that a\nsociety can be free only when it is governed by the rule of law, since\nwhile law typically coercively interferes, it interferes in a\nnon-arbitrary, predictable fashion (1960 [2011: 21, 153]). While\nBuchanan does not share Hayek\u2019s republican sympathies, he too\nagrees that general rules make liberty possible. Critically, none of\nthese three thinkers embrace a moralized conception of freedom where\nfreedom is the condition of a person whose rights are respected, in\ncontrast to libertarians like Nozick (1974).\n\nOne remarkably strong emphasis among neoliberals, especially Hayek, is\nthe importance of the rule of law. All persons have a right to be\ntreated as equals by the legal, administrative, and political\ninstitutions in their society. No one is to be favored according to\ntheir degree of social influence or social power or inherited status.\nWhen people are not protected by the rule of law, their freedoms are\nintolerably restricted because they can be arbitrarily interfered with\nand cannot predict how they will fare in the future. This means they\ncannot make unimpeded use of the liberties that they currently\npossess. Neoliberals wield the rule of law against those who favor\nmore extensive states, including both social-democratic liberals and\nsocialists, on the grounds that extensive administrative states must\nviolate the rule of law to engage in their characteristic activities.\nHayek argues that absolutism arises from \u201cpowerful, centralized\nadministrative machinery\u201d whose professional administrative\nclass becomes \u201cthe main rulers of the people\u201d (1960 [2011:\n193]). Large bureaucracies invariably interfere, and in an arbitrary\nfashion. This dangerous logic of bureaucracy was a fundamental feature\nof Buchanan\u2019s research program, and the rule of law is his\nsolution, too. For these reasons, neoliberals believe equal treatment\nbefore the law is a central procedural liberty that persons possess\nnot only in court but whenever they are subject to state coercion.\nNeoliberals embrace limited government in part because they believe\nthat equal treatment before the law can be achieved only by limiting\ngovernment and embracing capitalist economic liberties like freedom of\ncontract, since both institutional practices allow others to follow\ngeneral rules and avoid seeking approval from an arbitrary authority\n(1960 [2011: 205, 230]).\n\nThe most common rationale for freedom in Hayek and Friedman is\n\u201cignorance\u2014we cannot be sure we are right\u201d (Friedman\n1987 [2017: 185]). As we have seen, while Friedman says he favors\n\u201ca free society because my basic value is freedom itself\u201d,\nhe nonetheless asks, \u201cHow do I justify that preference? \u2026\nIf I really knew what sin is, I could not justify it\u201d (1987\n[2017: 185]). Similarly, Hayek says that the case for individual\nfreedom\n\n\nrests chiefly on the recognition of the inevitable ignorance of all of\nus concerning a great many of the factors on which the achievement of\nour ends and welfare depends. (1960 [2011: 29]; Caldwell 2004:\n347)\n\n\nAnd even: \u201cIf we knew how freedom would be used the case for it\nwould disappear\u201d (Hayek 1960 [2011: 31]). The purpose of\nindividual freedom is to enable each person to\n\n\nmake the fullest use of his knowledge, especially of his concrete and\noften unique knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and\nplace. (1960 [2011: 156\u20137])\n\n\nFriedman focuses on ignorance of moral facts, while Hayek focuses on\nmoral ignorance, as well as ignorance about how to organize\npeople\u2019s lives, but either way, ignorance is the chief\njustification for freedom.\n\nA certain kind of epistemic humility, particularly humility about how\nto organize society and what the consequences of our preferred\npolicies will be, is essential to neoliberal thought. However, as we\nhave seen, sometimes neoliberals adopt a broader skepticism that casts\nour grasp of moral facts into doubt. We ought to see epistemic\nhumility about a wide range of non-normative social facts as an\nessential feature of neoliberal doctrine, whereas humility about moral\nfacts is less central to understanding what neoliberalism is. Thus,\nneoliberalism can be formulated apart from this broader form of moral\nskepticism.\n\nNeoliberals also stress that freedom allows people with different ends\nto cooperate and create peace (Hayek 1978: 111\u2013136). This is an\nimportant theme for Buchanan (1975). As a contractarian, he thinks\nthat the goal of agreement on constitutional rules is to end the\nHobbesian state of war and secure enough peace to establish mutual\ngains from exchange. Thus, a second rationale for extensive negative\nliberties is that they are instrumental for cooperation and peace.\n\nNeoliberals obviously embrace strong rights to private property,\nrights that apply not only to goods and services for one\u2019s own\nconsumption but to capital as well (Hayek 1988: 35; 1973: 107). The\nrationale for private property rights is similar to the general case\nfor liberal liberties that we have already discussed. Hayek (1988: 35;\n1973: 107; 1960 [2011: 35]) and Friedman (1962a [2002: 8\u20139]) in\nparticular argue that we can\u2019t fully distinguish economic from\nother liberties even conceptually. They both famously argue that\npolitical and economic freedom cannot be separated in practice either.\nThat is part of the point of Capitalism and Freedom and\narguably the central point of The Road to Serfdom. Buchanan\n(1993: 230) and Hayek (1960 [2011: 141]) also stress that private\nproperty rights allow persons to make plans, in part because private\nproperty enables people to save money and thereby become less\ndependent on employers and bureaucrats. Private property is further\nthought to be \u201can essential condition for the prevention of\ncoercion\u201d and the wide dispersal of power (Hayek 1960 [2011:\n140]). Freedom of contract is embraced for similar reasons. And to\nrespect these rights, a society will have to embrace capitalism, since\nthe exercise of these rights inexorably yield capitalist economic\narrangements, where capital is held by both capital owners and\nworkers.\n4. Capitalism\n\nWe can understand capitalism as an economic system where the range of\ngoods and services on offer is governed in accord with a strong right\nto private property and a system in which prices are set by private\norganizations. People are free to exchange goods and services under\nwhatever terms they contract for, with few restrictions. Neoliberals\nshare this understanding, even if they do not always defend capitalism\nby name.\n\nIn defending capitalism, neoliberals focus on defeating two foes:\nsocialism and Keynesianism, which they typically consider as offering\nthe most influential alternatives to their preferred institutions.\nSocialism, at least the form of socialism targeted by neoliberals, is\nan economic system where capital is socially owned, typically by\ngovernment, and the capital stock is produced, organized, and its\noutputs distributed by the central government that is, where the\neconomy is centrally planned. Neoliberals attack Marxist socialism in\nthe strongest terms, but Marxists are not their sole targets. Hayek is\nkeen to refute the twentieth century socialist Oskar Lange (1936), who\nadopted some aspects of neoclassical economics. Neoliberals also\ntargeted democratic socialism; for example, Hayek (1944 [2007:\n163\u20134]) targeted Fabian socialists in The Road to\nSerfdom.\n\nThe neoliberal case against socialism is based on three concerns:\ninefficiency, conflict, and power. Socialism is inefficient, generates\nsocial conflict, and concentrates power in dangerous ways. Let\u2019s\nbegin with inefficiency, the familiar argument that socialist\neconomies impoverish society vis-\u00e0-vis\n capitalism.[5]\n Hayek\u2019s early claim to fame was his role in what is called the\nsocialist calculation debate, which concerned how socialist planners\ncan plan the production and distribution of capital goods without the\nuse of a price system. Socialists argued that planners should be able\nto plan by collecting preference and production information from\ncitizens. Ludwig von Mises (1922 [1936/1951]) began the debate by\narguing that, without a price system, the information required to plan\nthe economy did not exist. Without a price system, there is no\ninformation for planners to collect and compute. Oskar Lange (1936)\nreplied that socialist managers of firms could mimic market prices.\nHayek (1945) disagreed with Lange; even if the information required to\nplan the economy existed, it would be too hard to collect and\nimpossible to compute before the relevant information changed. The\nproblem is that the information required to plan the economy is not\ngiven to anyone. For Hayek, we can plan the economy\n\n\nif we possess all the relevant information, if we\ncan start out from a given system of preferences, and if we\ncommand complete knowledge of available means.\n\n\nBut that is \u201cemphatically not the economic problem\nwhich society faces\u201d (1945: 519). Instead,\n\n\nthe \u201cdata\u201d from which the economic calculus starts are\nnever for the whole society \u201cgiven\u201d to a single mind which\ncould work out the implications and can never be so given.\n\n\nIn contrast, the market economy can make use of this information\nthrough the price system. The price system can draw on each\nperson\u2019s local and often tacit knowledge to effectively produce\ngoods and services without collecting that information in one place.\nThe \u201cmarvel\u201d of the market is that, when some raw material\nis scarce,\n\n\ntens of thousands of people whose identity could not be ascertained by\nmonths of investigations, are made to use the material or its products\nmore sparingly,\n\n\nand this occurs\n\n\nwithout an order being issued, without more than perhaps a handful of\npeople knowing the cause. (1945: 527)\n\n\nHayek\u2019s analysis of how minds process information (Caldwell\n2004: 261\u2013285) and how commercial society, and systems of\ncultural and moral rules, evolve is perhaps the principal focus of his\nwork (2004: 286\u2013321). Friedman (2000 [2012: 234]) and Buchanan\n(1969: 87\u20138) agree with Hayek\u2019s\n analysis.[6]\n\nNeoliberals appeal to a range of considerations to justify the market\nbesides informational arguments, such as the creativity of the market\nmechanism and its capacity to raise living standards. Eamonn Butler\n(1985: 22) points out that Friedman\u2019s case for capitalism, as\ndeveloped in Capitalism and Freedom, is based on\n\n\nthe diversity, rapid adjustment, innovation and experimentation found\nin the market.\n\n\nIn Free to Choose, Friedman argues that, when the state\nattempts to centrally plan, ordinary citizens \u201chave a low\nstandard of living\u201d (Friedman & Friedman: 54\u20135). The\nmarket, on the other hand, has \u201cthe remarkable power of raising\nmaterial standards quicker than any other\u201d system, while\npreserving freedom (Butler 1985: 197). Hayek (1978: 67) emphasizes\nthat capitalism preserves competition, which he sees not as a means of\nreaching a market-clearing price but as a \u201cdiscovery\nprocedure\u201d for generating new ideas and innovations. Buchanan\ntends to focus on the argument that markets provide people with better\nincentives than those faced by government officials. Because\n\n\npoliticians and bureaucrats are seen as ordinary persons much like the\nrest of us, (Buchanan 1979: B4 [1984: 20])\n\n\nthey lack the motivation to even try to implement a socialist\nplan. Instead, they will use their power over the economy at least\npartly for selfish ends, which would undermine the effectiveness of\nsocialist government, even if all the informational problems could be\nsolved.\n\nThe next set of arguments against socialism is that socialism creates\nneedless conflict. Hayek writes that socialism\n\n\npresupposes a much more complete agreement in the relative importance\nof different social ends than actually exists\n\n\nand that, as a result,\n\n\nthe planning authority must impose upon the people the detailed code\nof values that is lacking. (1997: 193; also see 1944 [2007: 109,\n166])\n\n\nFriedman argues similarly in saying that\n\n\nthe wider the range of activities covered by the market, the fewer are\nthe issues on which explicitly political decisions are required and\nhence on which it is necessary to achieve agreement. (1962a [2002:\n24])\n\n\nMarkets allow people who disagree to benefit one another despite\nhaving different values. Socialism, in contrast, requires a central\nplan, and so must impose controversial and sectarian values and ends\non everyone. To solve these conflicts and impose a central plan,\nsocialist governments must concentrate political power.\n\nSocialism excessively concentrates power in other ways, too.\nSocialists have often argued that capitalist economic power can be\nreined in by transferring the means of production to society, but\nHayek (1944 [2007: 165]) replies that socialism does not\n\u201cextinguish power\u201d, it just concentrates power in one\nplace. Friedman (1955 [2017: 4]) agrees, arguing that \u201cpolitical\npower by its nature tends to be concentrated\u201d whereas economic\npower \u201ccan be highly deconcentrated if it is organized by means\nof an impersonal market\u201d. The danger of concentrating power in\npolitical institutions is that \u201cgovernment is more subject to\nconcentrated interest groups\u201d, whereas markets are altered by\nthe \u201cdiffuse pressure of millions of individual\nconsumers\u201d. Similarly, while governments promote monopolies,\n\u201cthe market breaks them down\u201d (Butler 1985: 223). An\nadvantage of markets is that people can refuse to engage in exchange,\nwhereas under socialism everyone is caught up in a power struggle.\nAdditionally, Hayek (1978: 99) argues that under socialism, political\npower determines the social position of individuals and groups, an\nironic result of a doctrine whose aim is to diffuse power. Buchanan\n(1993: 246) agrees, though for somewhat different reasons.\n\nNeoliberals do not defend capitalism on the ground that it gives\npeople what they deserve. Friedman and Buchanan do not make such\narguments, and Hayek argues against such claims. Hayek (1978:\n70) repeatedly says that there\u2019s no particular merit in market\noutcomes, and so one cannot say that market income is just or unjust.\nHayek, Friedman, and Buchanan understand that market outcomes are\noften arbitrary from a moral point of view. Markets make some\nundeserving persons rich and some deserving persons poor.\n\nAs noted, Keynesianism is neoliberalism\u2019s other great foe. Let\nus understand Keynesianism as a series of policy proposals aimed at\ncorrecting purported market failures at the macroeconomic level, and\nespecially as the use of deficit-financed spending to manage the\nbusiness cycle and stimulate the economy. These policies were inspired\nby John Maynard Keynes (1935 [1965: 2011]), even if he did not always\nconsistently adopt\n them.[7]\n\nAll three thinkers take great pains to answer Keynesian arguments for\ngovernment intervention. Hayek\u2019s (1941 [2007]) arguments concern\nhow government spending and the monetary authority\u2019s actions\naffect the structure of capital goods across the economy. Contra\nKeynes\u2019s (1935 [1965: 37\u201345]) comfort with statistical\naggregates in the General Theory, Hayek (1941 [2007])\ncontends that relying on simple economic aggregates obscures how\ncapital and investment are structured across the economy. Hayek also\nthinks the premier cause of recessions is policy that makes bank\ncredit too easy, which leads to malinvestment that has to be\nliquidated in a bust. Importantly Hayek\u2019s critique of Keynes was\nnot influential in the latter half of the twentieth century.\nFriedman\u2019s and Buchanan\u2019s ideas, especially\nFriedman\u2019s, carried more weight.\n\nFriedman and Buchanan are concerned about Keynesian claims that\nrecessions are due to declines in aggregate demand and can only be\naddressed with heavy helpings of debt-financed fiscal stimulus (even\nthough Keynes himself was not always a fan of debt-financed\ncountercyclical policy). Friedman (1959) developed the doctrine of\nmonetarism, which holds that inflation is always and everywhere a\nmonetary phenomenon. Inflation and the business cycle can be\ncontrolled by monetary policy and so do not require a fiscal response.\nWith his co-author, Anna Schwartz, Friedman (Friedman & Schwartz\n1963) argues that the Great Depression was due not to a fall in\naggregate demand but was instead caused by the Federal Reserve System,\nironically created to manage recessions, because the Fed allowed the\nmonetary base to collapse. Had the Fed ensured the growth of the\nmonetary supply, the Great Depression could have been avoided. This is\ncentral to the case for the market because the Great Depression was\nwidely blamed on capitalism. If the Depression was a\ngovernment failure, the result of monetary mismanagement,\nthen the Depression provides no basis for rejecting\ncapitalism\u2014and may even provide reason to embrace it.\n\nThe central policy response, for Friedman (1959), is to shift the\nmanagement of the business cycle from Congress to the Federal Reserve\nand lock the Federal Reserve into a monetary expansion rule to prevent\nit from making major mistakes. Monetary-policy makers are simply not\nknowledgeable enough to use monetary policy to manage the business\ncycle. Instead, they should be bound to a rule that would lead to\ngentle inflation, which would both avoid hyperinflation and prevent\ncyclical unemployment by mitigating the dislocations caused by sticky\nnominal wages, contra Keynes (1935 [1965: 231\u20137]). Focusing\nexclusively on growing the monetary base would also prevent a collapse\nin the money supply and thereby avoid some kinds of recession.\n\nBuchanan\u2019s critique of Keynes differs from Friedman\u2019s,\nthough their critiques are mutually reinforcing. Buchanan (1987, 1999)\nthinks that even if Keynes\u2019s diagnosis of recessions is correct,\nhis cure cannot work well so long as governments are staffed with\nreal-world people. Many politicians and government officials are more\nconcerned about benefiting themselves and special interest groups than\nabout promoting the common good. So, when a government engages in\ndebt-financed economic stimulus, the money is more likely to be\ndirected to politicians\u2019 favored groups than to the places the\nstimulus money is most needed. A central difficulty for Keynesian\nfiscal policy is the pervasive risk of government failure caused by\nthe actions of often self-interested economic actors, a consistent\ntheme of The Calculus of Consent (Buchanan & Tullock\n1962). Likewise, once people develop a taste for direct transfers,\nthey will make it hard to shrink the deficit when the recession is\nover, leading to long-term debt and lower economic prosperity and\ngrowth.\n5. Democracy\n\nNeoliberals embrace democracy. More specifically, they endorse equal\nrights to vote and participate in elections, and they support\nparliamentary democracy as the means of enacting legislation. Hayek\nsays,\n\n\nI profoundly believe in the basic principles of democracy as the only\neffective method which we have yet discovered of making peaceful\nchange possible, (1979: xiii)\n\n\nand he claims to be concerned about disillusionment with democracy\n\u201cas a desirable method of government\u201d. For Hayek, the\nmarket system must be \u201cembedded in a set of social\ninstitutions\u201d if it is to work, and that includes a\n\u201cdemocratic polity subject to the rule of law\u201d (Caldwell\n2004: 348). The point of The Road to Serfdom is to argue that\nliberal democratic socialism is unstable and that socialism must cease\nto be democratic or cease being socialism. So any attempt to plan the\neconomy would not only destroy liberal rights; it would inevitably\ndestroy democracy.\n\nHayek\u2019s case for democracy tends to be instrumentalist, as he\nargues that\n\n\nthe true value of democracy is to serve as a sanitary precaution\nprotecting us against an abuse of power. It enables us to get rid of a\ngovernment and try to replace it by a better one. (1979: 137)\n\n\nIt is also \u201cone of the most important safeguards of\nfreedom\u201d (1979: 5). And yet Hayek thinks recognizing that\npersons are equals requires not only equality before the law but\n\u201cthe demand that all men should also have the same share in\nmaking the law\u201d even if democracy is a \u201cmeans rather than\nan end\u201d that needs limits (1960 [2011: 103, 107\u20138]).\n\nThis commitment was shared by members of the Mont Pelerin Society,\nwhich Hayek organized. Angus Burgin argues that\n\n\nAn assumed relationship between free markets and democratic politics\npervaded the society\u2019s discussions throughout its first decade\nof existence and provided a foundational premise for many of the\nmembers\u2019 contributions to its debates. (2012: 117)\n\n\nFriedman routinely defends free markets on the ground that they\ncontribute to political freedom and democracy; both freedoms are\n\u201cinseparable\u201d (Butler 1985: 207). Friedman (1962a [2002:\n9]) often says that he knows of\n\n\nno example in time or place of a society that has been marked by a\nlarge measure of political freedom, and that has not also used\nsomething comparable to a free market to organize the bulk of economic\nactivity.\n\n\nSo, he appears to think that democracy is a great good, but we are led\nto guess the reasons why. One could argue that Friedman\u2019s case\nfor democracy is largely that it protects liberty and allows a bad\ngovernment to be peacefully replaced. But there is little in his\ncorpus that speaks to this question one way or another.\n\nBuchanan is the most democratic of the three. He agrees that democracy\nis essential for social peace and prosperity, but he emphasizes that\npolitical equality requires government to be based on the consent of\nthe people. Democracy is an extension of his individualism:\n\n\nThe approach must be democratic, which in this sense is merely a\nvariant of the definitional norm for individualism. Each man counts\nfor one, and that is that. (Buchanan 1975: 2).\n\n\nWhile Buchanan insists on unanimous consent for\nconstitutional rules (strikingly, among non-ideal persons), he thinks\nthat constitutions may allow for decision-making rules weaker than\nunanimity, such as majority rule. It is true that Buchanan (Buchanan\nand Tullock 1962: 85\u201396) argues that legislative rules should be\nsupermajoritarian rather than majoritarian, but that is still an\nembrace of democracy, especially when undergirded by the consent of\nthe people as a whole.\n\nHowever, unlike many classical and contemporary democratic theorists,\nneoliberals do not see democracy as involving a social ethos or\nnational culture, nor do they see democracy as an expression of\nfreedom in itself. As Hayek (1979: 5) notes, \u201cdemocracy itself\nis not freedom\u201d. Friedman insists that freedom is to be\nunderstood negatively, such that the political process is understood\nas restricting freedom and perhaps protecting it, but not as embodying\nit. Buchanan also criticizes what he regarded as an essentially\n\u201cromantic\u201d view of democracy according to which the will\nof the people is expressed in the actions of a democratic\ngovernment.\n\nNotably, neoliberals spend far more time arguing for limits on\ndemocracy than arguing for democracy itself. This is partly because,\nsince fascism was defeated, the goodness of democracy has been taken\nfor granted by both neoliberals and their interlocutors. Hayek,\nFriedman, and Buchanan instead focus on criticizing\n\u201cunlimited\u201d democracy. Hayek (1944 [2007: 111\u20132]) is\nworried that an unlimited democracy could undermine the rule of law\nand create tyranny. The powers of any \u201ctemporary majority\u201d\nhave to be limited, he says (1960 [2011: 106]). Unlimited power is\n\u201cthe fatal defect of the prevailing form of democracy\u201d and\nis based on the erroneous premise that all law \u201cemanate[s] from\nlegislatures\u201d (1979: 3\u20134). Another problem for unlimited\ndemocracy is that democratic assemblies will take on more power that\nthey can wield effectively and so will be forced to\n\n\nhand [authority] over to the administrators charged with the\nachievement of particular goals. (1960 [2011: 116])\n\n\nIn an unlimited democracy\n\n\nthe holders of discretionary powers are forced to use them, whether\nthey wish it or not, to favour particular groups on whose swing-vote\ntheir powers depend. (1979: 139)\n\n\nThe point of the third volume of Law, Legislation, and\nLiberty was arguably to restore faith in democracy by defending\nlimitations upon it.\n\nFriedman (1962b [2017: 26]) echoes many of these points, stressing\nthat political freedom is just \u201cthe absence of coercion of a man\nby his fellow men\u201d and that the fundamental threat to freedom\n\u201cis the power to coerce\u201d whether that power be in the\nhands of a dictator or of \u201ca momentary majority\u201d. Friedman\nalso worries that democracy will tend to lead to regulation,\ninefficiency, and control if we have \u201cbureaucratic\ndemocracy\u201d rather than \u201cparticipatory\n democracy\u201d.[8]\n\nBuchanan\u2019s (1962: 131\u2013146) rationale for constitutional\nconstraints on democracy is richer and more perceptive than\nHayek\u2019s or Friedman\u2019s. His contract theory is devoted to\narguing that simple majority rule can lead to a variety of problems,\nmost centrally the risks of shifting coalitions of voters or\nlegislators redistributing wealth away from one another, leading to\nPareto-inferior outcomes for all. Another problem with unlimited\ndemocracy is that\n\n\neven under the most favorable conditions the operation of the\ndemocratic process may generate budgetary excesses. Democracy may\nbecome its own Leviathan unless constitutional limits are imposed and\nenforced. (Buchanan 1975: 204\u20135)\n\n\nLimitations on democracy are also required by political equality\nitself, since the \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d is a threat to\nthe minority\u2019s equal rights, and can be especially dangerous\n\u201cbecause it feeds on the idealistic illusion that participation\nis all that matters (Buchanan 1993: 259). Consequently, Buchanan\n(1999: 75\u201388) advocates exit mechanisms, such as federalist\narrangements, that allow people to escape excessive democracy.\n\nFour caveats before the section ends: First, despite their concerns\nabout unlimited democracy, neoliberals want to protect democratic\nrights. One problem they have with expansive states is that large\nstates reduce the effectiveness of each person\u2019s vote. This is\nbecause large governments cannot balance their many tasks and cannot\nsecure agreement on top priorities. The result, Hayek argues, will be\ndemocratic instability, leading to dictatorship. In contrast to more\negalitarian liberals, neoliberals do not attempt to engineer the\ndemocratic process through democratic deliberation. They instead hope\nto protect democratic rights by adopting constitutional constraints\nlater in the democratic process, for example by restricting the power\nto legislate. Second, while neoliberals support restrictions on\ndemocracy, they strongly favor decentralizing of political power and\nensuring that power is held by all and they are committed to\nprotections from governmental and corporate predation and domination.\nAs Friedman notes,\n\n\nBusiness corporations are not a defense of free enterprise. On the\ncontrary, they are one of the chief sources of danger. (Burgin 2012:\n202)\n\n\nThey simply disagree with egalitarian liberals about how to ensure\nthis institutionally. As noted above, neoliberals stress designing\ninstitutions so that corrupt and domineering institutions cannot form,\nwithin or outside government, such as using markets. But they also\nappeal to constitutional mechanisms like supermajority rules (Buchanan\n& Tullock 1962) and federalism (Feld 2014) to limit oppression and\ncorruption. Thus, neoliberals are deeply concerned that people be\nprotected from excessive political control, but they do not emphasize\npublic deliberation is central to securing those ends. We might say\nthey prefer \u201cexit\u201d mechanisms over \u201cvoice\u201d\nmechanisms for restraining the use of political power (Hirschman\n1970). Third, neoliberals are not alone in advocating constitutional\nlimits on democracy, even though most democratic theorists on the left\nplace fewer limitations on democracy than neoliberals do.\n\nFinally, historians of political thought have drawn attention to the\nfact that the neoliberals discussed here were sometimes associated\nwith the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile. But Buchanan\n(Farrant & Tarko 2018) and Friedman (Burgin 2012: 205) have at\nbest a scant connection with that regime and were critical of it.\nUnfortunately, Hayek is another story. Hayek had a partial theory of\n\u201ctransitional dictatorship\u201d that allowed a liberal\ndictator to avoid socialist outcomes and transition a society into a\nliberal democracy, and this helps explain some favorable remarks he\nmade on behalf of the Pinochet regime (Farrant, McPhail, & Berger\n2012; Biebricher 2018: 142\u20137; Slobodian 2018: 277).\nHayek\u2019s support for the regime does not undermine the democratic\ncommitments of neoliberals, but Hayek was arguably too suspicious of\ndemocracy. We can see the dangers in sharply separating liberalism\nfrom democracy, which tempts one to choose liberal dictatorship over\ndemocratic socialism.\n6. The Welfare State\n\nNeoliberals support modest taxation, the redistribution of wealth, the\nprovision of public goods, and the implementation of social insurance,\nembracing a state somewhat more expansive than one where government\nprotects people from foreign powers and domestic criminals, produces\npublic goods, and provides limited services for the poor. For\ninstance, Hayek (Caldwell 2004: 291), Friedman (Butler 1985: 206), and\nBuchanan (1975: 35\u201352) favor government provision of public\ngoods because markets will under-produce public goods, and so\ngovernment should act even if it will sometimes fail (Butler 1985:\n206).\n\nOf course, neoliberals are skeptical of government regulation, largely\nbecause they think regulatory bodies tend to be turned from good\npurposes to bad ones (2007: 93). This is a consistent theme of\nFriedman\u2019s (1962a [2002: 137\u2013160]) work, especially in his\ncriticisms of occupational licensure. And the analysis of rent-seeking\nis one of Buchanan\u2019s main ideas, shared by his long-time\nco-author Gordon Tullock. Large bureaucracies turn too much power over\nto administrators, power that practically begs to be misused by\nspecial interests (Butler 1983: 209). And, of course, neoliberals all\noppose Keynesian fiscal policy, especially debt-financed stimulus\n(Buchanan 1987: 456; Butler 1985: 186). But these concerns are\nconsistent with embracing the welfare state.\n\nHayek is quite friendly to various government interventions. In\nThe Road to Serfdom, Hayek (1944 [2007]) defends\ncountercyclical monetary policy, government construction of\ntransportation infrastructure, social insurance for natural disasters,\ngovernment health insurance, a basic minimum income, and strict\nregulations with respect to working hours, health and safety on the\njob, poisons, deforestation, harmful agricultural methods, noise,\nsmoke, and the prices of goods and services that are natural\nmonopolies (1944 [2007: 22, 43\u20134, 133\u20135, 217]; Burgin\n2012: 90\u20131). Similarly, The Constitution of Liberty\nsays government should prevent of depressions and provide pensions,\nmedical care, and money for education in the form of vouchers (1960\n[2011: 264, 276, 286, 294, 379]). Hayek repeatedly stresses that\nthe\n\n\nold formulae of laissez faire or non-intervention do not provide us\nwith an adequate criterion for distinguishing between what is and what\nis not admissible in a free system. (1960 [2011: 231]; also see Hayek\n1944 [2007: 71]; 1973: 62; 1979: 41)\n\n\nHayek even supports a basic income:\n\n\n\u2026 the assurance of a certain minimum income for everyone\n\u2026 appears not only to be a wholly legitimate protection against\na risk common to all, but a necessary part of the Great Society in\nwhich the individual no longer has specific claims on the members of\nthe particular small groups into which he was born. (1979: 55)\n\n\nWhile Hayek\u2019s use of the term \u201clegitimate\u201d is\nimprecise and may only somewhat overlap with the use of the term in\ncontemporary political philosophy, he apparently thinks that\ngovernments are morally required to engage in welfare-state measures.\nGovernments should pursue poverty relief not only because it is\nbeneficial but because it is the right thing to do. Hayek worries that\nsocial safety nets can get out of control, but he supports them anyway\n(Caldwell 2004: 291).\n\nWhile Friedman is the most libertarian of the three (Burgin 2012:\n213), he never advocates abolishing the redistribution of wealth for\nsome purposes, claiming that government ought to \u201crelieve acute\nmisery and distress\u201d (Friedman 1951 [2012: 7]). Government\nshould\n\n\nprotect members of the community who cannot be regarded as\n\u201cresponsible\u201d individuals, principally children and the\ninsane. (Butler 1985: 206)\n\n\nAnd again,\n\n\nGovernment relief of poverty, the liberal will support and welcome,\nprimarily on the explicitly paternalistic ground of taking care of the\nirresponsible. (Friedman 1974b [2012: 23])\n\n\nOne of his most famous policy proposals is a negative income tax,\nwhere the poor would receive cash transfers if their incomes were low\nenough, financed by positive income taxes on the rich and middle class\n(Friedman 1962a [2002: 191\u20134]). Friedman (1960 [2002:\n191\u20132]) thought this policy was legitimate to reduce poverty\nbecause pure private charity may invite free-riding. He (1962a [2002:\n85\u2013107]) is also the inventor of the school-voucher policy, and\nhe (1974b [2012: 20]) supported compulsory education so long as\ngovernment does not control the\n schools.[9]\n Friedman worried that the welfare state would be too bureaucratic and\nauthoritarian, however, which is why he favored replacing most\nwelfare-state programs with cash transfers.\n\nTwo more points about Friedman on poverty relief. First, Friedman\nthinks that\n\n\n[t]here are no natural rules and definitions of property. There is\nultimately an essentially arbitrary element to where we draw the line.\n(1974a [2017: 86])\n\n\nThis is a point usually stressed by critics of libertarianism on the\nground that property rights are conventional, not natural, and so\ncannot morally prohibit redistribution (Murphy & Nagel 2002). This\npassage suggests that Friedman\u2019s political philosophy does not\ninclude a natural right of private property as an impediment to\nredistribution. Second, Friedman sees his defense of the welfare state\nas a part of his non-ideal theory, not his ideal. He supports vouchers\nand the negative income tax\n\n\nnot because these are necessarily part of my ideal utopia[n] society\nbut because they seem to me the most effective steps, given where we\nare, in moving toward where we want to go. (Burgin 2012: 175)\n\n\nIn fact, Friedman (1974a [2017: 79]) has sympathies with anarchism,\nthough he thinks it is not \u201ca feasible social structure\u201d.\nThis is consistent describing neoliberalism as a non-ideal theory.\nWhile in ideal theory, Friedman is a libertarian, or at least more\nlibertarian than most other neoliberals, his non-ideal theory is\nneoliberalism.\n\nBuchanan is both the hardest to pin down on the welfare state and the\nmost egalitarian. He has virtually nothing to say about government\npoverty relief. Buchanan\u2019s contractarianism nonetheless embraces\nsome redistribution, as he thinks his social contract would yield\nunanimous agreement on having a \u201cproductive\u201d\nstate, which provides many tax-financed goods, and could also provide\nsocial insurance (Buchanan 1975: 124). Buchanan also defends a\nprinciple of equal opportunity, which he thinks requires a 100 percent\ninheritance tax that would prevent the formation of an aristocracy.\nPresumably this principle could justify other forms of\nredistribution.\n\nNeoliberals stridently reject one of the most common rationales for\nthe welfare state, namely pursuing an egalitarian conception of social\njustice. Hayek is clearest on this point, given his total rejection of\nthe very idea of social justice, which he understands, somewhat\npeculiarly, as a set of moral principles that govern the\njustifiability of specific distributions of economic resources, though\nnot moral principles that govern the functioning of an economic system\nas a whole. Hayek (1978: 78) thinks that the idea of social justice is\nconfused in that justice cannot be applied to specific market outcomes\nbecause they are not the result of direct, conscious choices. Social\njustice is an incoherent idea, much like the idea of a \u201cmoral\nstone\u201d. Hayek thinks it imperative that the state not be used to\nachieve a precise income distribution (Caldwell 2004: 350):\n\n\nany policy aiming directly at a substantive ideal of distributive\njustice must lead to the destruction of the Rule of Law. (1944 [2007:\n79])\n\n\nYet Hayek has an idiosyncratic understanding of social justice. He\nthinks it requires the that certain specific economic outcomes be\nimposed, rather than that a society\u2019s moral, legal, and\npolitical rules work to the advantage of all. Hayek supports\nthe latter requirement. Hayek says that the \u201cmost desirable\norder of society\u201d is\n\n\none which we would choose if we knew that our initial position in it\nwould be decided purely by chance (such as the fact of our being born\ninto a particular family). (1978: 132)\n\n\nIf Hayek sounds like Rawls, it is no coincidence. Hayek\u2019s\nreading of Rawls\u2019s earlier papers (not A Theory of\nJustice) led him to believe he had no quarrel with Rawls, for\nRawls\n\n\nacknowledges that the task of selecting specific systems of\ndistributions of desired things as just must be abandoned. (1978:\n 100)[10]\n\n\nThus, Hayek seems to share Rawls\u2019s concept of social\njustice, though not his conception of it. And this concept of\nsocial justice is compatible with liberty. The pursuit of social\njustice only implies the destruction of the rule of law if our\nconception of social justice requires us to tinker with particular\neconomic outcomes (Hayek 1960 [2011: 85]). These points are by now\nwell-understood by Hayek\u2019s defenders (Tomasi 2012:\n142\u2013150).\n\nBuchanan and Friedman are less focused on rejecting social justice,\nbut their positions resemble Hayek\u2019s. Buchanan\u2019s\ncontractarianism leads him to hold that a society\u2019s\ndistributions are fair if they are the product of rules that all agree\nto, and otherwise not, so if pursuing distributive justice means\nbreaking the constitutional rules that we have agreed to, it is\nproblematic. But social contracts may have redistributive rules. If\npeople agree to redistributive rules, then redistribution is\njustified. In this way, Buchanan is closer to Rawls than Hayek is.\n\nFriedman has much less to say about social justice. He mostly stresses\nthat only some kinds of equality are desirable. Friedman (1980 [2017:\n144]) often says, for instance, that we should only seek equality of\nopportunity, not equality of outcome (Butler 1985: 218). But he also\nfeels the need to argue that markets do not have an inherent tendency\nto produce very unequal outcomes. Friedman (1955 [2017: 14]) says\nthat\n\n\nthe way to reduce inequality \u2026 is not by the misleading\npalliative of sharing the wealth but by improving the workings of the\nmarket, strengthening competition, and widening opportunities for\nindividuals to make the most of their own qualities.\n\n\nDifferences in economic power do not argue for a redistributive state\nbut for more capitalism:\n\n\nThe virtue of free enterprise capitalism is that it sets one\nbusinessman against another and is thus the most effective device for\ncontrol. (1974a [2017: 84])\n\n\nFree markets undermine monopoly economic power, whereas government\ngenerates it (Butler 1985: 210).\n7. Criticisms of Neoliberalism\n\nThis section covers criticisms of neoliberalism, but it leaves out a\ngreat many of them. The reason for this is that many of the most\nwell-known criticisms of neoliberalism are simply criticisms of\ncapitalism as such. Accordingly, this section focuses on criticisms\naimed directly at neoliberalism.\n7.1 Ethos Criticisms\n\nMany criticize neoliberalism for structuring society around the\nmarket, commodifying market relations, and in general manipulating\npeople into serving the ends of what is best for commerce or economic\nproduction. In this way, neoliberalism builds society around a cash\nnexus. But unlike full capitalism, neoliberalism does so in a covert\nway that takes serious scholarly work to demonstrate. Neoliberalism\nitself is not an ethos, as noted above, but neoliberalism\nmight be seen to give rise to an excessively capitalist/transactional\nrelationship between persons. While she rejects this characterization\nof neoliberalism, Jessica Whyte argues that it is often characterized\nas\n\n\nan amoral economic ideology that subordinates all values to an\neconomic rationality, (2019: 19)\n\n\nfollowing a number of others, like Wendy Brown (2015). Here the\nanalysis draws heavily on Foucault (2010) where neoliberalism is said\nto reduce practical rationality to economic considerations, where\n\n\nthere is no difference between the infraction of the highway code and\na premeditated murder. (2015: 253\u20134)\n\n\nIndeed, one might make the more worrisome argument that neoliberalism\nleads not so much to selfish attitudes but towards bigoted,\nhierarchical, and traditional ones (Brown 2019: 7, 37).\n7.2 Inequality\n\nOne central concern about neoliberalism is that, even if it boosts\neconomic growth, it also increases economic inequality, which is\nproblematic in several ways. Two kinds of inequality criticisms are\ngenerally offered. The more well-known are the empirical criticisms\nthat neoliberal regimes lead to dangerous inequalities just from the\ndata, such as Thomas Piketty\u2019s book, Capital (2014),\nwhich holds that economic inequality is growing and is a threat to\ndemocracy, much as Martin Gilens\u2019s (2014) work on inequality and\nthe responsiveness of democratic policy-making to the richest 10%.\n\nThe other kind of critique of inequality under neoliberalism is\nderived from Rawls\u2019s work. As is well-known, Rawls rejected\nwelfare-state capitalism and a more robust form of capitalism which he\ncalled the system of natural liberty on the grounds that they do not\nsatisfy Rawls\u2019s two principles of justice (Rawls 2001;\nO\u2019Neill and Williamson 2014). Rawls argued that even\nwelfare-state capitalism cannot protect the value of political liberty\nor realize its priority (Rawls 1993 [2005]) because it allows for the\naccumulation of capital in too few hands, which leads to economic\ndomination of politics, and shuts many people out of the goods of\nowning and operating at least some of the capital they need to enjoy\nthe worth of their constitutional liberties.\n\nAnother kind of inequality that has been raised as a concern for\nneoliberal societies is the imbalance of political power within the\nfirm between bosses and workers. Elizabeth Anderson (2019) has argued,\nfor instance, that this is a form of tyrannical \u201cprivate\ngovernment\u201d and that the institutions defended by neoliberals\n(though she does not use this term) are insufficient to equalize the\nfreedoms of capitalists and workers.\n7.3 Undermining Democracy\n\nA very common criticism of neoliberalism is that it undermines\ndemocracy. This might be because high economic inequality undermines\ndemocracy, as Martin Gilens (2014) argues in Affluence and\nInfluence and defended by Larry Bartels (2008 [2016]). Another\nway in which neoliberalism could undermine democracy is by\nprioritizing the protection of classical liberal economic liberties,\nlike the right to private property. These can lead to restrictions on\nthe ability of democratic citizens to choose to redistribute wealth.\nThis problem is especially acute given Hayek\u2019s favorable view of\nthe Pinochet regime in Chile. Hayek hoped that Chile would become a\ndemocracy, but he believed that the Pinochet coup had allowed Chile to\ndodge the bullet of democratic socialism as advocated by Salvador\nAllende, Pinochet\u2019s predecessor. There is a tension between the\nliberalism and the democratic commitments within neoliberalism that in\npractice tends to mean that democracy suffers.\n7.4. Economic Irrationality\n\nNeoliberal regimes rely heavily on market mechanisms, and neoliberals\nclaim that markets are efficient or at least highly economically\nproductive (neoliberals disagree about how to characterize and explain\nmarket productivity and efficiency). But behavioral economists\n(Kahneman 2013; Ariely 2010) have identified various biases in human\nreasoning that undermine the homo economicus model that\nneoliberals are said to use to model and predict economic development\n(though as shown above, neoliberals have a subtler relationship with\nhomo economicus). See entry on\n bounded rationality.\n7.5 Keynesian Rebuttals\n\nNeoliberalism, as noted, arose in part in response to the dominance of\nKeynesian macro-economic policy. But Keynesians, most notably Paul\nKrugman (2012), have struck back by arguing that neoliberal criticisms\nof Keynesian policy fail. This is especially true because neoliberals\noften claimed that fiscal policy is ineffective stimulus\nvis-\u00e0-vis monetary stimulus. During the Great Recession,\nKrugman argued that the Federal Reserve had lowered interest rates so\nmuch that further monetary stimulus would fail, and so fiscal policy\nhad to intervene.\n\nMany of the criticisms of neoliberal regimes engaging in\n\u201causterity\u201d during the Great Recession are based in an\nunderlying Keynesian model, as the critics of government spending cuts\nduring the Great Recession were often based on the idea that they hurt\nthe economic prospects of the poor, whereas according to neoliberals,\nshrinking government spending during a recession is not harmful to the\npoor for a variety of reasons. See entry on\n philosophy of economics.\n7.6 Trickle-Down Economics\n\nOne common charge against neoliberalism is its false promise of\n\u201ctrickle-down\u201d benefits of economic growth to the poor\nfrom the rich (Quiggin 2012). Strictly speaking, trickle-down\neconomics is not a genuine school of economic thought, nor would\nHayek, Friedman, or Buchanan have accepted that description of their\nviews. They did argue that all would benefit from the prosperity\nbrought about through the free market, but this was not necessarily\nbecause the rich would benefit first. Hayek (1960 [2011]) argued that\nthere is a kind of trickle-down effect for the prices of goods and\nservices, where luxuries for the rich become commonalities for the\npoor because manufacturers figure out how to lower prices to broaden\nmarket penetration over time. And indeed, it is standard in mainstream\neconomics to hold that as businesses accumulate capital, they can\nafford to pay their workers more and so can bid workers away from\nother companies. That process often involves increasing wages, so more\ncapital in the hands of the rich can lead to higher wages for\nthe poor through fairly ordinary causal channels. All the same, many\nneoliberal officials promised gains for the poor that did not often\nmaterialize.\n7.7 Libertarian Criticisms\n\nNeoliberalism and libertarianism are distinct, if related views. And\nin some respects, the neoliberals were libertarian under some\nconditions. Indeed, Buchanan thought anarchy was the morally best\nregime, even if it was infeasible in practice. But it is still common\nfor libertarians to criticize more moderate libertarians for allowing\nany redistribution of wealth, such as Murray Rothbard (1973, 1982\n[2002]), Robert Nozick (1974), or for prioritizing democracy over more\nepistocratic or elite-leaning forms of political decision-making, such\nas Jason Brennan (2016).\n7.8 Colonialist Criticisms\n\nIt is common in some circles to argue that neoliberal regimes are\ncolonialist in character, though in an unusually direct way. The\nthought is that neoliberalism was adopted by regimes in the Anglophone\nworld and in much of Western Europe, and that this formed an\ninternational elite consensus about how economies around the world\nshould be run. This led to a \u201cWashington Consensus\u201d that\ncaused policy interventions that interfered with the democratic\ngovernance of developing nations, increased inequality, and made the\npoor worse off. For comprehensive discussion, see Whyte (2019:\nchapters 3\u20135).\n7.9 Populist/Nationalist Criticisms\n\nIt is increasingly common for right-wing populists to criticize\nneoliberal policy on the grounds that it emphasizes free trade and\nfree immigration lead to a range of deleterious consequences, from the\nshrinking of the industrial base of rich democratic countries like the\nUnited States, such as that advanced by Patrick Deneen (2019). A\nstronger form of this concern is that allowing immigrants from\ndifferent cultures to acquire citizenship within a country will harm\nor degrade the culture and politics of that country.\n7.10 Feminist Criticisms\n\nSome, like Nancy Fraser (2017), worry that neoliberalism has co-opted\nfeminism by making the feminist ideal into one that serves as a kind\nof false market-based meritocracy, where the aim of feminism is, for\ninstance, that woman who has well-paying career, and at its highest\nideal, female entrepreneurship and becoming CEOs of a company. This\nleft feminism unable to attend to the needs and interests of women who\nneoliberalism has harmed. See entry on\n feminist perspectives on globalization.\n7.11 Remaining Criticisms\n\nNeoliberalism is subject to other objections, but many resemble\nproblems for other liberal democratic theories, such as the conflict\nbetween liberal rights (however understood) and democracy\u2014the\n\u201cprocedure-substance\u201d dispute in the deliberative\ndemocracy literature, as well as how any sufficiently liberal approach\nto associational freedom takes the freedom of marginalized groups\nseriously given the prospect for local oppression. Neoliberals have\ndiverse conceptions of freedom, though typically negative, with all\nthe standard criticisms those views invite. And, then, to the extent\nthat neoliberalism like Hayek and Buchanan adopt a contractarian\nframework for justifying institutions, their defenses will inherit all\nthe difficulties with contractarianism.\n8. Summary\n\nThis entry is not meant to determine the one true meaning of\n\u201cneoliberalism\u201d, but rather to illuminate neoliberalism as\na coherent philosophical doctrine embraced by figures commonly called\nneoliberals. The entry also prioritizes more even-handed and less\npejorative uses of the term in recent historical research. This is not\nto discount more historical and dynamic understandings of\nneoliberalism. They contain insight. But the goal of this entry has\nbeen to characterize neoliberalism as a philosophical position. If we\ndo so, we can understand neoliberalism as a politico-economic doctrine\nthat embraces robust liberal capitalism, constitutional democracy, and\na modest welfare\n state.[11]\n",
