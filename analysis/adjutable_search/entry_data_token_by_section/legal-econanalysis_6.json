    "main_text": "The Nature of Law\n3. The Nature of Law\n\nPhilosophical inquiries into the nature of law have generally gone\nunder the rubric \u201cthe concept of law.\u201d Unfortunately, as\nmultiple projects and questions fall under this single rubric, the\ndebate has generated more confusion than clarity. This section seeks\nfirst to disentangle the various questions that have been conflated\nwithin a single concept of law.\n\nThe section then focuses on two of those concepts, identified in the\nnext subsection as the doctrinal and sociological (or social\nscientific) concepts of law. We argue first that economic analysis of\nlaw is not committed to any specific doctrinal concept. Second, and\nfinally, we argue that economic methodology does suggest how to define\na sociological concept of law that is parasitic on a concept of\ngovernance and on the value of legality. \n",
