    "main_text": "What (Linguistic) Ambiguity Isn\u2019t || Context Sensitivity\n2.2 Context Sensitivity\n\nContext sensitivity is (potential) variability in content due purely\nto changes in the context of utterance without a change in the\nconvention of word usage. Thus, \u2018I am hungry\u2019 varies in\ncontent speaker to speaker because \u2018I\u2019 is context\nsensitive and shifts reference depending on who utters it.\n\u2018I\u2019, however, is not massively ambiguous \u2013 if\nanything, the mystery of context sensitive terms has been how they\ncould have a single meaning with multiple reference.\n\u2018Bank\u2019 is ambiguous, not (at least, not obviously) context\nsensitive. Of course, knowledge of context may well help disambiguate\nan ambiguous utterance. Nonetheless, ambiguity is not characterized by\ninteraction with (extra- linguistic) context but is a property of the\nmeanings of the terms.\n",
