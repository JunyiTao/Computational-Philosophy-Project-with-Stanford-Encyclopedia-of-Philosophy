    "main_text": "Ernst Schr\u00f6der\n4. Ernst Schr\u00f6der\n\nFrege\u2019s contributions were not immediately understood or\nappreciated, and in the closing decade of the century logic was\ndominated by the three volumes of Ernst Schr\u00f6der\u2019s\nVorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik (1890\u201395).\nSchr\u00f6der provided an encyclopedic treatment of the logical work\nof Boole and Peirce, systematizing and extending their results.\nPeirce\u2019s quantifiers make their appearance in volume two, but\nthe distinction between first-and second-order quantification is not\ndrawn with comparable clarity. As Frege pointed out in his review\n(1895), Schr\u00f6der\u2019s notation did not distinguish set\nmembership from the subset relation, and as a result it can be\ndifficult to tell whether he intends a given quantification to range\nover the subsets of a domain (i.e., to be second-order) or over its\nelements (i.e., to be first-order). Schr\u00f6der employs both\nsecond-order and first-order quantifications; and in his third volume\nhe used the technique of expanding a second-order quantification into\nan infinite product of first-order quantifications\u2014a technique\nthat was a development of the Peircian product notation, and that was\nto furnish the starting point for the investigations of\nL\u00f6wenheim. But Schr\u00f6der does not extract from his wider\nsystem a sub-system of first-order logic, and does not treat the\ndistinction of orders as itself being of any great significance,\neither mathematically or philosophically. In this sense, he is less\nclear than Peirce\u2019s paper of 1885. (A helpful analysis of\nSchr\u00f6der\u2019s logical work is contained in Brady 2000.)\n",
