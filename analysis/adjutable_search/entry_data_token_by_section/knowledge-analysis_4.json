Lightweight Knowledge\n\nSome epistemologists have suggested that there may be multiple senses\nof the term \u201cknowledge\u201d, and that not all of them require\nall three elements of the tripartite theory of knowledge. For example,\nsome have argued that there is, in addition to the sense of\n\u201cknowledge\u201d gestured at above, another, weak\nsense of \u201cknowledge\u201d, that requires only true belief (see\nfor example Hawthorne 2002 and Goldman & Olsson 2009; the latter\ncontains additional relevant references). This view is sometimes\nmotivated by the thought that, when we consider whether someone knows\nthat p, or wonder which of a group of people know that\np, often, we are not at all interested in whether the relevant\nsubjects have beliefs that are justified; we just want to know whether\nthey have the true belief. For example, as Hawthorne (2002:\n253\u201354) points out, one might ask how many students know that\nVienna is the capital of Austria; the correct answer, one might think,\njust is the number of students who offer \u201cVienna\u201d as the\nanswer to the corresponding question, irrespective of whether their\nbeliefs are justified. Similarly, if you are planning a surprise party\nfor Eugene and ask whether he knows about it, \u201cyes\u201d may be\nan appropriate answer merely on the grounds that Eugene believes that\nyou are planning a party.\n\nOne could allow that there is a lightweight sense of knowledge that\nrequires only true belief; another option is to decline to accept the\nintuitive sentences as true at face value. A theorist might, for\ninstance, deny that sentences like \u201cEugene knows that you are\nplanning a party\u201d, or \u201ceighteen students know that Vienna\nis the capital of Austria\u201d are literally true in the envisaged\nsituations, explaining away their apparent felicity as loose talk or\nhyperbole.\n\nEven among those epistemologists who think that there is a lightweight\nsense of \u201cknows\u201d that does not require justification, most\ntypically admit that there is also a stronger sense which does, and\nthat it is this stronger state that is the main target of\nepistemological theorizing about knowledge. In what follows, we will\nset aside the lightweight sense, if indeed there be one, and focus on\nthe stronger one.\n",
