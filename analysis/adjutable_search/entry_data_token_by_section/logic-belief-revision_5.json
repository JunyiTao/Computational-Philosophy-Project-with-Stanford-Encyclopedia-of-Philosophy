    "main_text": "Contraction || Recovery and its avoidance\n2.3 Recovery and its avoidance\n\nRecovery is the most debated postulate of belief change. It is easy to\nfind examples that seem to validate Recovery. A person who first loses\nand then regains her belief that she has a dollar in her pocket seems\nto return to her previous state of belief. However, other examples can\nalso be presented, in which Recovery yields implausible results. The\nfollowing are two of the examples that have been offered to show that\nRecovery does not hold in general:\n\n\n\nI have read in a book about Cleopatra that she had both a son and a\ndaughter. My set of beliefs therefore contains both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\),\nwhere \\(p\\) denotes that Cleopatra had a son and \\(q\\) that she had a\ndaughter. I then learn from a knowledgeable friend that the book is in\nfact a historical novel. After that I contract \\(p\\vee q\\) from my set\nof beliefs, i.e., I do not any longer believe that Cleopatra had a\nchild. Soon after that, however, I learn from a reliable source that\nCleopatra had a child. It seems perfectly reasonable for me to then\nadd \\(p\\vee q\\) to my set of beliefs without also reintroducing either\n\\(p\\) or \\(q\\). This contradicts Recovery.\n\n\nI previously entertained the two beliefs \u201cGeorge is a\ncriminal\u201d \\((p)\\) and \u201cGeorge is a mass murderer\u201d\n\\((q)\\). When I received information that induced me to give up the\nfirst of these beliefs \\((p)\\), the second \\((q)\\) had to go as well\n(since \\(p\\) would otherwise follow from \\(q)\\).\n\nI then received new information that made me accept the belief\n\u201cGeorge is a shoplifter\u201d \\((r)\\). The resulting new belief\nset is the expansion of \\(K\\div p\\) by \\(r\\), \\((K\\div p)+r.\\) Since\n\\(p\\) follows from \\(r\\), \\((K\\div p)+p\\) is a subset of \\((K\\div\np)+r\\). By recovery, \\((K\\div p)+p\\) includes \\(q\\), from which\nfollows that \\((K\\div p)+r\\) includes \\(q\\).\n\nThus, since I previously believed George to be a mass murderer, it\nfollows from Recovery that I cannot after that believe him to be a\nshoplifter without believing him to be a mass murderer.\n\n\nDue to the problematic nature of this postulate, it should be\ninteresting to find intuitively less controversial postulates that\nprevent unnecessary losses in contraction. The following is an attempt\nto do that:\n\nCore-retainment:\n\nIf \\(q \\in K\\) and \\(q \\not\\in K\\div p\\), then there is a belief set\n\\(K'\\) such that \\(K' \\subseteq K\\) and that \\(p \\not\\in K'\\) but \\(p\n\\in K'+q\\). \n\nCore-retainment requires of an excluded sentence \\(q\\) that it in some\nway contributes to the fact that \\(K\\) implies \\(p\\). It gives the\nimpression of being weaker and more plausible than Recovery. However,\nit has been shown that if an operator \\(\\div\\) for a belief set \\(K\\)\nsatisfies Core-retainment, then it satisfies Recovery.\n\nAttempts have been made to construct operations of contraction on\nbelief sets that do not satisfy Recovery. Arguably, the most plausible\nof these constructions is the operation of severe withdrawal\nthat has been thoroughly investigated by Hans Rott and Maurice\nPagnucco (2000). It can be constructed from an operation of epistemic\nentrenchment by modifying the definition as follows:\n\n\\(q \\in K\\div p\\) if and only if \\(q \\in K\\) and either \\(p \\lt q\\) or\n\\(p \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\). \n\nSevere withdrawal has interesting features, but it also has the\nfollowing property:\n\nExpulsiveness:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\) and \\(q \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\)\nthen either \\(p \\not\\in K\\div q\\) or \\(q \\not\\in K\\div p\\). \n\nThis is a highly implausible property of belief contraction, since it\ndoes not allow unrelated beliefs to be undisturbed by each\nother\u2019s contraction. Consider a scholar who believes that her\ncar is parked in front of the house. She also believes that\nShakespeare wrote the Tempest. It should be possible for her to give\nup the first of these beliefs while retaining the second. She should\nalso be able to give up the second without giving up the first.\nExpulsiveness does not allow this. The construction of a plausible\noperation of contraction for belief sets that does not satisfy\nRecovery is still an open issue.\n",
