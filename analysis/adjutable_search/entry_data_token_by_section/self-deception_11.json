Origin of Self-Deception: Adaptation or Spandrel\n\nQuite aside from the doxastic, strategic, and moral puzzles\nself-deception raises, there is the evolutionary puzzle of its origin.\nWhy do human beings have this capacity in the first place? Why would\nnatural selection allow a capacity to survive that undermines the\naccurate representation of reality, especially when inaccuracies about\nindividual ability or likely risk can lead to catastrophic errors?\n\nMany argue that self-deceptively inflated views of ourselves, our\nabilities, our prospects, or our control\u2014so-called\n\u2018positive illusions\u2019\u2014confer direct benefits in terms\nof psychological well-being, physical health, and social advancement\nthat serve fitness (Taylor and Brown 1994; Taylor 1989; McKay and\nDennett 2009). Just because \u2018positive illusions\u2019 make us\n\u2018feel good,\u2019 of course, it does not follow that they are\nadaptive. From an evolutionary perspective, whether an organism\n\u2018feels good\u2019 or is \u2018happy\u2019 is not significant\nunless it enhances survival and reproduction. McKay and Dennett (2009)\nargue that positive illusions are not only tolerable; evolutionarily\nspeaking, they contribute to fitness directly. Overly positive beliefs\nabout our abilities or chances for success appear to make us more apt\nto exceed our abilities and achieve success than more accurate beliefs\nwould (Taylor and Brown 1994; Bandura 1989). According to Johnston and\nFowler (2011), overconfidence is \u201cadvantageous, because it\nencourages individuals to claim resources they could not otherwise win\nif it came to a conflict (stronger but cautious rivals will sometime\nfail to make a claim, and it keeps them from walking away from\nconflicts they would surely win).\u201d Inflated attitudes regarding\nthe personal qualities and capacities of one\u2019s partners and\nchildren would also seem to enhance fitness by facilitating the\nthriving of offspring (McKay and Dennett 2009).\n\nAlternatively, some argue that self-deception evolved to facilitate\ninterpersonal deception by eliminating the cues and cognitive load\nthat consciously lying produces and by mitigating retaliation should\nthe deceit become evident (von Hippel and Trivers 2011; Trivers 2011,\n2000, 1991). On this view, the real gains associated with\n\u2018positive illusions\u2019 and other self-deceptions are\nbyproducts that serve this greater evolutionary end by enhancing\nself-deceivers\u2019 ability to deceive. Von Hippel and Trivers\n(2011) contend that \u201cby deceiving themselves about their own\npositive qualities and the negative qualities of others, people are\nable to display greater confidence than they might otherwise feel,\nthereby enabling them to advance socially and materially.\u201d\nCritics have pointed to data suggesting high self-deceivers are deemed\nless trustworthy than low self-deceivers (McKay and Dennett 2011).\nOthers have complained that there is little data to support this\nhypothesis (Dunning 2011; Van Leeuwen 2007a, 2013a), and what data\nthere is shows us to be poor lie-detectors (Funkhouser 2019; Vrij\n2011). Some challenge this theory by noting that a simple disregard\nfor the truth would serve as well as self-deception and have the\nadvantage of retaining true representations (McKay and Prelec 2011) or\nthat often self-deceivers are the only ones deceived (Van Leeuwen\n2007a; Kahlil 2011). Van Leeuwen (2013a) raises the concern that the\nwide variety of phenomena identified by this theory as self-deception\nrender the category so broad that it is difficult to tell whether it\nis a unified phenomenon traceable to particular mechanisms that could\nplausibly be sensitive to selection pressures. Funkhouser (2019)\nworries that the unconscious retention of the truth that von Hippel\nand Trivers (2011) propose would generate tells of its own and that\nthe psychological complexity of this explanation is unnecessary if the\ngoal is to deceive others (which is itself contentious) since that\ngoal would be easier to achieve through self-delusion. So, von Hippel\nand Trivers\u2019 (2011) theory may explain self-delusion but not\ncases of self-deception marked by deep conflict (Funkhouser\n2017b).\n\nIn view of these shortcomings, Van Leeuwen (2007a) argues the capacity\nfor self-deception is a spandrel\u2014a byproduct of other\naspects of our cognitive architecture\u2014not an adaptation in the\nstrong sense of being positively selected. While Funkhouser (2017b)\nagrees that the basic cognitive architecture that allows motivation to\ninfluence belief formation\u2014as well as the specific tools used to\nform or maintain biased belief\u2014were not selected for the sake of\nself-deception, it nevertheless makes sense to say, for at least some\ncontents, that self-deception is adaptive (2017b).\n\nWhether it is an adaptation or a spandrel, it\u2019s possible this\ncapacity has nevertheless been retained as a consequence of\nits fitness value. Lopez and Fuxjager (2011) argue that the broad\nresearch on the so-called \u201cwinner effect\u201d\u2014the\nincreased probability of achieving victory in social or physical\nconflicts following prior victories\u2014lends support to the idea\nthat self-deception is at least weakly adaptive since self-deception\nin the form of positive illusions, like past wins, confers a fitness\nadvantage. Lamba and Nityananda (2014) test the theory that\nself-deceived are better at deceiving others\u2014specifically,\nwhether overconfident individuals are overrated by others and\nunderconfident individuals underrated. In their study, students in\ntutorials were asked to predict their own performance on the next\nassignment as well as that of each of their peers in the tutorial in\nterms of absolute grade and relative rank. Comparing these predictions\nand the actual grades given on the assignment suggests a strong\npositive relationship between self-deception and deception. Those who\nself-deceptively rated themselves higher were rated higher by their\npeers as well. These findings lend suggestive support to the claim\nself-deception facilitates other deception. While these studies\ncertainly do not supply all the data necessary to support the theory\nthat the propensity to self-deception should be viewed as adaptation,\nthey do suggest ways to test these evolutionary hypotheses by focusing\non specific phenomena.\n\nWhether or not the psychological and social benefits identified by\nthese theories explain the evolutionary origins of the capacity for\nself-deceit, they may well shed light on its prevalence and\npersistence, as well as point to ways to identify contexts in which\nthis tendency presents high collective risk (Lamba and Nityananda\n2014).\n",
