    "main_text": "Individual essences and bare identities || Chisholm\u2019s Paradox and bare identities\n4.1 Chisholm\u2019s Paradox and bare identities\n\nOne such argument, adapted from Chisholm 1967, goes as follows. Taking\nAdam and Noah in the actual world as our examples (and pretending, for\nthe sake of the example, that the biblical characters are real\npeople), then, on the plausible assumption that not all of their\nproperties are essential to them, it seems that there is a possible\nworld in which Adam is a little more like the actual Noah than he\nactually was, and Noah a little more like the actual Adam than he\nactually was. But if there is such a world, then it seems that there\nshould be a further world in which Adam is yet more like the actual\nNoah, and Noah yet more like the actual Adam. Proceeding in this way,\nit looks as if we may arrive ultimately at a possible world that is\nexactly like the actual world, except that Adam and Noah have\n\u2018switched roles\u2019 (plus any further differences that follow\nlogically from this, such as the fact that in the\n\u2018role-switching\u2019 world Eve is the consort of a man who\nplays the Adam role, but is in fact Noah). But if this can happen with\nAdam and Noah, then it seems that it could happen with any two actual\nindividuals. For example, it looks as if there will be a possible\nworld that is a duplicate of the actual world except for the fact that\nin this world you play the role that Queen Victoria plays in\nthe actual world, and she plays the role that you play in the\nactual world (cf. Chisholm 1967, p. 83 in 1979). But this may seem\nintolerable. Is it really the case that Queen Victoria could have had\nall your actual properties (except for identity with you)\nwhile you had all of hers (except for identity with her)?\n\nHowever, if one thinks that such conclusions are intolerable, how are\nthey to be avoided? The obvious answer is that what is needed, in the\nAdam-Noah case, is that the roles played by Adam and Noah in the\nactual world include some properties that are essential to their\nbearers\u2019 being Adam and Noah respectively: that Adam and Noah\ndiffer non-trivially in their essential properties as well as\nin their accidental properties: more precisely, that Adam has some\nessential property that Noah essentially lacks, or vice versa. For if\n\u2018the Adam role\u2019 includes some property that Noah\nessentially lacks, then, of course, there is no possible world in\nwhich Noah has that property, in which case the Adam role (in all its\ndetail) is not a possible role for Noah, and the danger of a\nrole-switching world such as the one described above is avoided.\n\nThe supposition that Adam and Noah differ in their essential\nproperties in this way, although sufficient to block the generation of\nthis example of a role-switching world, does not by itself imply that\neach of Adam and Noah has an individual essence: a set of\nessential properties whose possession is (not only necessary but also)\nsufficient for being Adam or Noah. Suppose that Adam has, as one of\nhis essential properties, living in the Garden of Eden, whereas Noah\nessentially lacks this property. This will block the possibility of\nNoah\u2019s playing the Adam role, although it does not, by itself,\nimply that nothing other than Adam could play that role.\nHowever, when we reflect on the potential generality of the argument,\nit appears that, if we are to block all cases of role-switching\nconcerning actual individuals, we must suppose that every actual\nindividual has some essential property (or set of essential\nproperties) that every other actual individual essentially lacks. For\nexample, to block all cases of role-switching concerning Adam and\nother actual individuals, there must be some component of \u2018the\nAdam role\u2019 that is not only essential to being Adam, but also\ncannot be played, in any possible world, by any actual individual\nother than Adam.\n\nEven if we suppose that all actual individuals are distinguished from\none another by such \u2018distinctive\u2019 essential properties,\nthis still does not, strictly speaking, imply that they have\nindividual essences. For example, it does not rule out the existence\nof a possible world that is exactly like the actual world except that,\nin this possible world, the Adam role is played, not by Adam, but by\nsome merely possible individual (distinct from all actual\nindividuals). However, if we find intolerable the idea that there are\nsuch possible worlds\u2014worlds that, like the role-switching world,\ndiffer from the actual world only in the identities of some of the\nindividuals that they contain\u2014then, it seems, we must suppose\nthat individuals like Adam (and Noah and you) have (non-trivial)\nindividual essences, where an individual essence of Adam is (by\ndefinition) some property (or set of properties) that is both\nessential to being Adam and also such that it is not possessed, in any\npossible world, by any individual other than Adam\u2014i.e., an\nessential property (or set of properties) that guarantees that its\npossessor is Adam and no one else.\n\nChisholm (1967) arrives at his role-switching world by a series of\nsteps. Thus his argument appears to rely on the combination of the\ntransitivity of identity (across possible worlds) with the assumption\nthat a succession of small changes can add up to a big change. And\n\u2018Chisholm\u2019s Paradox\u2019 (as it is called) is sometimes\nregarded as relying crucially on these assumptions, suggesting that it\nhas the form of a sorites paradox (the type of paradox that\ngenerates, from apparently impeccable assumptions, such absurd\nconclusions as that a man with a million hairs on his head is bald).\n(See, for example, Forbes 1985, Ch. 7.)\n\nHowever, there are versions of the role-switching argument that do not\nrely on the cumulative effect of a series of small changes. Suppose we\nassume that Adam and Noah do not differ from one another in their\nessential properties; in other words, that all the differences between\nthem are accidental (i.e., contingent) differences. It seems\nimmediately to follow that any way that Adam could have been is a way\nthat Noah could have been, and vice versa. But one way that Adam could\nhave been is the way Adam actually is, and one way that Noah could\nhave been is the way Noah actually is. So (if Adam and Noah do not\ndiffer in their essential properties) it seems that there is a\npossible world in which Adam plays the Noah role, and a possible world\nin which Noah plays the Adam role. But there is no obvious reason why\na world in which Adam plays the Noah role and a world in which Noah\nplays the Adam role shouldn\u2019t be the very same world. And in\nthat case there is a possible world in which Adam and Noah have\nswapped their roles. This argument for the generation of a\nrole-switching world does not rely on a series of small changes: all\nthat it requires is the assumption that there is no essential\ndifference between Noah and Adam: or, to put it another way, that any\nessential property of Noah is also an essential property of Adam, and\nvice versa. (See Mackie 2006, Ch. 2; also Adams 1979; cf. Dorr,\nHawthorne, and Yli-Vakkuri 2021.)\n",
