Piety: Welcoming What Happens as Part of the Whole\n\n\nMarcus writes,\n\n\nEvery nature is satisfied with itself when it goes along its way well, and the\nrational nature goes along its way well when it assents to nothing false or unclear\namong its impressions, when it directs impulses to communal actions,\nwhen it generates desires and inclinations for only those things that\nare in our power, and when it welcomes everything apportioned to it by\ncommon nature. (viii.7)\n\n\nThe last of these four behaviors is productive of piety. The\nkey idea in piety is that the cosmos as a whole is providentially\ndesigned, and so is as good as it can be, and so its parts are as good\nas they can be, and so our attitude towards every part ought to be\nacceptance\u2014or as he sometimes puts it more strongly, love.\nAccording to Hadot (1998, 128), Marcus follows Epictetus in\ndistinguishing impulse (horm\u00ea) from desire\n(orexis), and innovates by restricting impulse to the sphere\nof our activity. Desire, parallel to impulse, is restricted to\nthe sphere of our passivity; thus, we should desire whatever befalls\nus. Hadot is mistaken here, for according to the Stoics, our\nreactions to what befalls us are also impulses, and desire is a species\nof impulse. Marcus says either to restrict desire to what is up\nto us (ix.7) or to quench (sb\u00easai) it. Epictetus\ntells us to refrain from desire for the time being (iii.24.23, 24,\n85). The reason to quench desire is the danger of desiring the\nwrong thing: to desire something is to believe it to be good, and\nto have a runaway impulse towards it. This also gives\nus an argument against desiring the things that befall one. We\nmight note that Marcus, in the passage above, recommends not desiring\nbut welcoming (aspazomen\u00ea) whatever befalls one.\nPerhaps we should associate desire (orexis) with pursuing, and\nwelcoming with contentment upon receiving.\n\n\nWe can use our understanding of piety as appreciation of providence\nto illuminate two slogans frequently found in Marcus:\n\u2018providence or atoms?\u2019 and \u2018erase\nimpressions\u2019.\n",
