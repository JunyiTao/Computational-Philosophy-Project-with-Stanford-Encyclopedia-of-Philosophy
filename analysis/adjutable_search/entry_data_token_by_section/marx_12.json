    "main_text": "Theory of History || Functional Explanation\n3.4 Functional Explanation\n\nPrior to Cohen\u2019s work, historical materialism had not been\nregarded as a coherent view within English-language political\nphilosophy. The antipathy is well summed up with the closing words of\nH.B. Acton\u2019s The Illusion of the Epoch: \u201cMarxism\nis a philosophical farrago\u201d (1955: 271). One difficulty taken\nparticularly seriously by Cohen is an alleged inconsistency between\nthe explanatory primacy of the forces of production, and certain\nclaims made elsewhere by Marx which appear to give the economic\nstructure primacy in explaining the development of the productive\nforces. For example, in The Communist Manifesto Marx and\nEngels state that: \u201cThe bourgeoisie cannot exist without\nconstantly revolutionising the instruments of production\u201d\n(MECW 6: 487). This appears to give causal and explanatory\nprimacy to the economic structure\u2014capitalism\u2014which brings\nabout the development of the forces of production. Cohen accepts that,\non the surface at least, this generates a contradiction. Both the\neconomic structure and the development of the productive forces seem\nto have explanatory priority over each other. Unsatisfied by such\nvague resolutions as \u201cdetermination in the last instance\u201d,\nor the idea of \u201cdialectical\u201d connections, Cohen\nself-consciously attempts to apply the standards of clarity and rigour\nof analytic philosophy to provide a reconstructed version of\nhistorical materialism.\n\nThe key theoretical innovation is to appeal to the notion of\nfunctional explanation, also sometimes called \u201cconsequence\nexplanation\u201d (Cohen 1978 [2001]: 249\u2013296). The\nessential move is cheerfully to admit that the economic structure,\nsuch as capitalism, does indeed develop the productive forces, but to\nadd that this, according to the theory, is precisely why we have\ncapitalism (when we do). That is, if capitalism failed to develop the\nproductive forces it would disappear. And, indeed, this fits\nbeautifully with historical materialism. For Marx asserts that when an\neconomic structure fails to develop the productive forces\u2014when\nit \u201cfetters\u201d the productive forces\u2014it will be\nrevolutionised and the epoch will change. So the idea of\n\u201cfettering\u201d becomes the counterpart to the theory of\nfunctional explanation. Essentially fettering is what happens when the\neconomic structure becomes dysfunctional.\n\nNow it is apparent that this renders historical materialism\nconsistent. Yet there is a question as to whether it is at too high a\nprice. For we must ask whether functional explanation is a coherent\nmethodological device. The problem is that we can ask what it is that\nmakes it the case that an economic structure will only persist for as\nlong as it develops the productive forces. Jon Elster has pressed this\ncriticism against Cohen very hard (Elster 1985: 27\u201335). If we were\nto argue that there is an agent guiding history who has the purpose\nthat the productive forces should be developed as much as possible\nthen it would make sense that such an agent would intervene in history\nto carry out this purpose by selecting the economic structures which\ndo the best job. However, it is clear that Marx makes no such\nmetaphysical assumptions. Elster is very critical\u2014sometimes of\nMarx, sometimes of Cohen\u2014of the idea of appealing to\n\u201cpurposes\u201d in history without those being the purposes of\nanyone.\n\nIndeed Elster\u2019s criticism was anticipated in fascinating terms\nby Simone Weil (1909\u20131943), who links Marx\u2019s appeal to\nhistory\u2019s purposes to the influence of Hegel on his thought:\n\n\nWe must remember the Hegelian origins of Marxist thought. Hegel\nbelieved in a hidden mind at work in the universe, and that the\nhistory of the world is simply the history of this world mind, which,\nas in the case of everything spiritual, tends indefinitely towards\nperfection. Marx claimed to \u201cput back on its feet\u201d the\nHegelian dialectic, which he accused of being \u201cupside\ndown\u201d, by substituting matter for mind as the motive power of\nhistory; but by an extraordinary paradox, he conceived history,\nstarting from this rectification, as though he attributed to matter\nwhat is the very essence of mind\u2014an unceasing aspiration towards\nthe best. (Weil 1955 [1958: 43])\n\n\nCohen is well aware of the difficulty of appealing to purposes in\nhistory, but defends the use of functional explanation by comparing\nits use in historical materialism with its use in evolutionary\nbiology. In contemporary biology it is commonplace to explain the\nexistence of the stripes of a tiger, or the hollow bones of a bird, by\npointing to the function of these features. Here we have apparent\npurposes which are not the purposes of anyone. The obvious counter,\nhowever, is that in evolutionary biology we can provide a causal story\nto underpin these functional explanations; a story involving chance\nvariation and survival of the fittest. Therefore these functional\nexplanations are sustained by a complex causal feedback loop in which\ndysfunctional elements tend to be filtered out in competition with\nbetter functioning elements. Cohen calls such background accounts\n\u201celaborations\u201d and he concedes that functional\nexplanations are in need of elaborations. But he points out that\nstandard causal explanations are equally in need of elaborations. We\nmight, for example, be satisfied with the explanation that the vase\nbroke because it was dropped on the floor, but a great deal of further\ninformation is needed to explain why this explanation works.\n\nConsequently, Cohen claims that we can be justified in offering a\nfunctional explanation even when we are in ignorance of its\nelaboration. Indeed, even in biology detailed causal elaborations of\nfunctional explanations have been available only relatively recently.\nPrior to Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882), or arguably Jean-Baptiste\nLamarck (1744\u20131829), the only candidate causal elaboration was\nto appeal to God\u2019s purposes. Darwin outlined a very plausible\nmechanism, but having no genetic theory was not able to elaborate it\ninto a detailed account. Our knowledge remains incomplete in some\nrespects to this day. Nevertheless, it seems perfectly reasonable to\nsay that birds have hollow bones in order to facilitate flight.\nCohen\u2019s point is that the weight of evidence that organisms are\nadapted to their environment would permit even a pre-Darwinian atheist\nto assert this functional explanation with justification. Hence one\ncan be justified in offering a functional explanation even in the\nabsence of a candidate elaboration: if there is sufficient weight of\ninductive evidence.\n\nAt this point the issue, then, divides into a theoretical question and\nan empirical one. The empirical question is whether or not there is\nevidence that forms of society exist only for as long as they advance\nproductive power, and are replaced by revolution when they fail. Here,\none must admit, the empirical record is patchy at best, and there\nappear to have been long periods of stagnation, even regression, when\ndysfunctional economic structures were not revolutionised.\n\nThe theoretical issue is whether a plausible elaborating explanation\nis available to underpin Marxist functional explanations. Here there\nis something of a dilemma. In the first instance it is tempting to try\nto mimic the elaboration given in the Darwinian story, and appeal to\nchance variations and survival of the fittest. In this case\n\u201cfittest\u201d would mean \u201cmost able to preside over the\ndevelopment of the productive forces\u201d. Chance variation would be\na matter of people trying out new types of economic relations. On this\naccount new economic structures begin through experiment, but thrive\nand persist through their success in developing the productive forces.\nHowever the problem is that such an account would seem to introduce a\nlarger element of contingency than Marx seeks, for it is essential to\nMarx\u2019s thought that one should be able to predict the eventual\narrival of communism. Within Darwinian theory there is no warrant for\nlong-term predictions, for everything depends on the contingencies of\nparticular situations. A similar heavy element of contingency would be\ninherited by a form of historical materialism developed by analogy\nwith evolutionary biology. The dilemma, then, is that the best model\nfor developing the theory makes predictions based on the theory\nunsound, yet the whole point of the theory is predictive. Hence one\nmust either look for an alternative means of producing elaborating\nexplanation, or give up the predictive ambitions of the theory.\n",
