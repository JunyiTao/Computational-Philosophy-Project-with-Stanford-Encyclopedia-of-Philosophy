In mathematics and computer science there seems to be a\nconsiderable class of decision problems that cannot be solved\nconstructively in polynomial time, \\(t(x)=x^c\\), where c is a\nconstant and x is the length of the input), but only through\nsystematic search of a large part of the solution space, which might\ntake exponential time, \\(t(x)=c^x\\). This difference roughly coincides\nwith the separation of problems that are computationally feasible from\nthose that are not.\n\nThe issue of the existence of such problems has been framed as the\npossible equivalence of the class P of decision problems that can be\nsolved in time polynomial to the input to the class NP of problems for\nwhich the solution can be checked in time polynomial to the input.\n(Garey & Johnson 1979; see also Cook 2000\n [OIR]\n for a good introduction.) \n\nExample: A well-known example in the class NP is the\nso-called subset sum problem: given a finite set of natural\nnumbers S, is there a subset \\(S^{\\prime}\\subseteq S\\) that\nsums up to some number k? It is clear that when someone\nproposes a solution \\(X \\subseteq S\\) to this problem we can easily\ncheck whether the elements of X add up to k, but we\nmight have to check almost all subsets of S in order to find\nsuch a solution ourselves. \n\nThis is an example of a so-called decision problem. The answer is a\nsimple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, but it might be hard to\nfind the answer. Observe that the formulation of the question\nconditional to S has descriptive complexity \\(\\log k + c\\),\nwhereas most random subsets of S have a conditional descriptive\ncomplexity of \\(|S|\\). So any subset \\(S^{\\prime}\\) that adds up to\nk might have a descriptive complexity that is bigger then the\nformulation of the search problem. In this sense search seems to\ngenerate information. The problem is that if such a set exists the\nsearch process is bounded, and thus effective, which means that the\nphrase \u201cthe first subset of S that adds up to\nk\u201d is an adequate description. If \\(\\textrm{P} =\n\\textrm{NP}\\) then the Kolmogorov complexity and the Levin complexity\nof the set \\(S^{\\prime}\\) we find roughly coincide, if \\(P \\neq\n\\textit{NP}\\) then in some cases \\(Kt(S^{\\prime}) \\gg K(S^{\\prime})\\).\nBoth positions, the theory that search generates new information and\nthe theory that it does not, are counterintuitive from different\nperspectives.\n\nThe P vs. NP problem, that appears to be very hard, has been a rich\nsource of research in computer science and mathematics although\nrelatively little has been published on its philosophical relevance.\nThat a solution might have profound philosophical impact is\nillustrated by a quote from Scott Aaronson:\n\n\nIf P = NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than\nwe usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in\n\u201ccreative leaps,\u201d no fundamental gap between solving a\nproblem and recognizing the solution once it\u2019s found. Everyone\nwho could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could\nfollow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss\u2026. (Aaronson 2006\n\u2013 in the Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nIn fact, if \\(\\textrm{P}=\\textrm{NP}\\) then every object that has a\ndescription that is not too large and easy to check is also easy to\nfind. \n",
