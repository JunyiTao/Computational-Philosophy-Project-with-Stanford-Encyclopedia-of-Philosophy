    "main_text": "Large Cardinal Axioms and the Interpretability Hierarchy\n5. Some Philosophical Considerations\n\n\nThe main question that arises in light of the independence results is\nwhether one can justify new axioms that settle the statements left\nundecided by the standard axioms.  There are two views.  On the first\nview, the answer is taken to be negative and one embraces a radical\nform of pluralism in which one has a plethora of equally legitimate\nextensions of the standard axioms.  On the second view, the answer is\ntaken (at least in part) to be affirmative, and the results simply\nindicate that ZFC is too weak to capture the mathematical truths.\nThis topic is quite involved and lies outside the scope of the present\narticle.  \n\n\n\n\nBut there are other philosophical questions more directly related to\nthe themes of this article.  First, what is the significance of the\nempirical fact that the large cardinal axioms appear to be wellordered\nunder interpretability?  Second, what is the significance of the\nempirical fact that large cardinal axioms play a central role in\ncomparing many theories from conceptually distinct domains?  Let us\nconsider these two questions in turn.\n\n\nOne might try to argue that the fact that the large cardinal axioms\nare wellordered under interpretability is a consideration in their\nfavour.  However, this would be a weak argument.  For, as we have\nnoted above, all \u201cnatural\u201d theories appear to be wellordered\nunder interpretability and this includes theories that are\nincompatible with one another.  For example, it is straightforward to\nselect \u201cnatural\u201d theories from higher and higher degrees of theories\nin the wellordered sequence that are incompatible with one another.\nIt follows that the feature of being wellordered under\ninterpretability, while remarkable, can not be a point in favour of\ntruth.\n\n\nBut large cardinal axioms have additional features that singles them\nout from the class of natural theories in the wellordered sequence of\ndegrees.  To begin with they provide the most natural way to climb the\nhierarchy of interpretability\u2014they are the simplest and most natural\nmanifestation of pure mathematical strength.  But more important is\nthe second component mentioned above, namely, the large cardinal\naxioms act as intermediaries in comparing theories from conceptually\ndistinct domains.  For recall how this works: Given ZFC+\u03c6 and\nZFC+\u03c8 one finds large cardinal axioms \u03a6 and \u03a8 such\nthat (using the methods of inner and outer models) ZFC+\u03c6 and\nZFC+\u03a6 are mutually interpretable and ZFC+\u03c8 and ZFC+\u03a8\nare mutually interpretable.  One then compares ZFC+\u03c6 and\nZFC+\u03c8 (in terms of interpretability) by mediating through the\nnatural interpretability relationship between ZFC+\u03a6 and\nZFC+\u03a8.\n\n\nIt turns out that in many cases this is the only known way to\ncompare ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+\u03c8, that is, in many cases there is\nno direct interpretation in either direction, instead one must\n  pass through the large cardinal axioms.  Can this additional\nfeature be used to make a case for large cardinal axioms?  The answer\nis unclear.  However, what is clear is the absolute centrality of\nlarge cardinal axioms in set theory.\n",
