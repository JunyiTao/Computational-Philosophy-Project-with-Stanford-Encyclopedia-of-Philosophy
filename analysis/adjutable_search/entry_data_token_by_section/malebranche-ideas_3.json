    "main_text": "Other Arguments for Vision in God\n4. Other Arguments for Vision in God\n\nIn the previous section, we examined Malebranche\u2019s most mature\nargument for locating ideas in God in the Argument from Properties.\nThis argument, which first appeared in Elucidations of The Search\nAfter Truth, highlights the Neoplatonic and Augustinian character\nof Malebranchean ideas and reveals his efforts to correct Descartes.\nWhen coupled with the Cartesian view that all perception is\nrepresentational, it provides one of Malebranche\u2019s strongest\nsupports for Vision in God.\n\nWhen first introducing the doctrine of Vision in God in the\nSearch, however, he takes a different tack. There he presents\na negative, or eliminative, argument in which he enumerates five\ncompeting theories of how material objects are known, and then\nsystematically eliminates each one until only Vision in God remains.\nFor such an argument to succeed, one must ensure that the enumeration\nis complete \u2013 that it exhausts all possible theories.\nMalebranche clearly thinks that he satisfies this requirement, though\ncritics from John Locke onwards have complained that it does not. Some\nrecent commentators have attempted to show why Malebranche\u2019s\nenumeration is, indeed, complete or at least why he thinks it is\n(Connell 1967, 162; Nadler 1992, 138\u2013140).\n\nBut rather than pursue that line of thought, we might note something\nelse about Malebranche\u2019s strategy: he does not rest content with\nthe standard structure of an eliminative argument. After raising\ndoubts about the four other theories, he marshals various positive\narguments in support of vision in God. One might think that\nMalebranche is simply making as strong a case as possible for his\npreferred theory or, since he has these other arguments ready to hand,\ndisplaying them for his readers\u2019 edification. But when his\npositive arguments are examined carefully, one finds that many of the\nsame reasons are used to cast doubt upon the rival theories. It would\nappear that as much as trying to convince the reader of Vision in God,\nthe Argument from Elimination lays the groundwork for that doctrine by\nprefiguring the positive reasons in favor of it or, to put it somewhat\ndifferently, by revealing what is required for us to have knowledge of\nmaterial objects. Malebranche holds that once one appreciates the\nrequirements or preconditions for knowledge, she will be forced to\nconclude that only Vision in God satisfies all of them. Thus, behind\nthe surface of Malebranche\u2019s eliminative argument lies a deeper,\nmore positive approach. Given this understanding of\nMalebranche\u2019s strategy, and in the interests of brevity, we\nshall focus here on the positive arguments that he adduces in favor of\nVision in God.\n\nMalebranche\u2019s arguments appeal primarily (but not exclusively)\nto facts about the divine nature and about the relation between God\n\u2013 the infinite substance \u2013 and his finite creation. This\nreflects the theological spirit of Malebranche\u2019s philosophy\ngenerally, but it is also a common strategy of the modern rationalists\n(most notably, Descartes, Spinoza, Malebranche, and Leibniz) to derive\nconclusions about finite beings from considerations about infinite\nbeing. Malebranche identifies five main reasons in support of the\nclaim that \u2018we see all things in God.\u2019 Before developing\nthese reasons, however, he reminds the reader of two other\nconsiderations, introduced previously, that provide a prima facie case\nin favor of Vision in God. First, there must be ideas of all created\nbeings in God, for otherwise he would not have been able to create.\nThe view that \u2018blind creation\u2019 is impossible is part of\nMalebranche\u2019s Augustinian heritage, and relies on the intuition\nthat in order to create something one must have models or archetypes\nof what one is going to create. Ideas, then, serve as these\narchetypes, but they must be in God himself prior to creation for\notherwise there would something external to God constraining what he\ncould create, which would violate his omnipotence or supreme power.\nGod can have the ideas of all things within him because he contains an\ninfinite number of perfections and, as discussed in section 2, he sees\nall possible beings by considering how his perfections can be imitated\nin finite ways. There is a deeper intuition here as well, and that is\nthat if God is truly wise or omniscient then creation must be an\nintelligible and rational process whereby God acts in accordance with\ncertain standards. Malebranche rejects Descartes\u2019 doctrine that\nthe created universe is an arbitrary product of God\u2019s\nindifferent will. Ideas in God, then, constitute these eternal and\nimmutable standards.\n\nSecond, Malebranche holds that created minds enjoy an intimate union\nwith God even in this life, as a result of our complete and utter\ndependence on the creator. As a result of this union, God is always\n\u2018present\u2019 to our mind. Speaking metaphorically,\nMalebranche says that God is, in a sense, the \u2018place\u2019 of\nminds as space is the place of bodies. On the basis of these two\nconsiderations, Malebranche concludes that God could, if he saw fit,\ncause finite minds to see all things in him: \u2018the mind surely\ncan see what in God represents created beings, since what in God\nrepresents created beings is very spiritual, intelligible, and present\nto the mind. Thus, the mind can see God\u2019s works in Him, provided\nthat God wills to reveal to it what in Him represents them\u2019\n(Search 3.2.6, OC 1:437; LO 230). Since the ideas of all\nthings are already in God and our minds enjoy an intimate\nunion with him at all times, it is easy to see how God could make us\nsee all things in him. But, again, Malebranche does not intend these\nconsiderations to be decisive, only to show how Vision in God is\npossible and \u2018conforms to reason\u2019 (ibid., OC 1:438; LO\n230). The introduction of these considerations is primarily strategic,\nfor he then proceeds to develop and reinforce them in his five main\narguments, to which we now turn:\n\n\n\nThe Simplicity of the Divine Ways: Having already highlighted\nthe rational character of creation in the first consideration,\nMalebranche begins this argument with another such point that once\nagain underscores God\u2019s wisdom. God always creates in the\nsimplest of ways. This is a consequence not only of his simplicity,\nbut also of his wisdom and power.\n\nGod never does in very complicated fashion what can be done in a very\nsimple and straightforward way. For God never does anything uselessly\nand without reason. His power and wisdom are not shown by doing lesser\nthings with greater means \u2013 that is contrary to reason and\nindicates a limited intelligence. Rather, they are shown by doing\ngreater things with very simple and straightforward means (ibid.).\n\nHow is Vision in God simpler? And simpler than what? One of the\nalternative theories that he considers in the Argument from\nElimination is that God creates a complete set of innate ideas within\neach mind. But our mind is capable of thinking of an infinite number\nof figures, numbers, etc. Thus, if this alternative theory were true,\nit would mean God would have to create an infinite set of ideas for\nevery finite mind. But as God already contains within his\nunderstanding a complete set of ideas or archetypes for creation, it\nis far simpler for him to reveal them to us, to allow us to see all\nthings in him.\n\nOne should not underestimate the intended force of this argument.\nMalebranche is not conceding that God could have stocked\nevery mind with a complete set of innate ideas but just happened to\nact in accordance with his simplicity. One commentator has noted that\nin the first four editions of the Search, Malebranche begins\nthe argument by saying, \u2018although it is not absolutely denied\nthat God can make an infinity of infinite numbers of entities\nrepresentative of things with each mind he creates, nevertheless one\nought not to believe that he does\u2026.\u2019 Daisie Radner\nconcludes on the basis of this statement that the appeal to simplicity\nis \u2018not considered even by Malebranche to be one of the stronger\narguments for seeing all things in God,\u2019 for it does not rule\nout the alternative view, absolutely speaking (1978, 52). But this\nconclusion misunderstands the sentence above that Malebranche\nsubsequently excised in later editions. To get a grip on what he means\nwe must compare similar language, and a similar point about divine\nsimplicity, to which Malebranche appeals in his theodicy (i.e., his\nsolution to the problem of evil). He attempts to justify the existence\nof evil in the world by saying that although God wished to create the\nbest of all possible worlds absolutely speaking, he was constrained to\nact in such ways as honor his attributes or perfections \u2013\nespecially his simplicity: \u2018His ways must bear the character of\nHis attributes, as well as His work. It is not enough that His work\nhonor Him by its excellence; it is necessary in addition that His ways\nglorify Him by their Divinity\u2019 (Dialogue 9, OC 12:214; JS 163).\nFor Malebranche, God\u2019s works and his ways (or means of creating)\nmust honor him; he therefore strikes a balance between the\n\u2018beauty of the work\u2019 and the \u2018simplicity of his\nways\u2019 (Dialogue 9, OC 12:215; JS 164). This is not the best of\nall possible worlds that God could create, absolutely speaking, but it\nis the best relative to the simplicity of his ways (Jolley 2004). In\nmaking this point, Malebranche is not claiming that God could have\nmade a better world, for that would require violating his simplicity.\nOn the supposition that he is going to create anything, God must act\nso as to honor his perfections; otherwise he would not be an\nall-perfect being, which is impossible. The same point applies to\nMalebranche\u2019s epistemology; here too divine simplicity\nconstitutes a side constraint on God\u2019s actions, such that there\nis no genuine sense in which he could have created each mind with a\ncomplete set of ideas. Divine simplicity demands Vision in God.\n\n\n\nDependence: It is a mark of Christian philosophy generally to\nstress the dependence of created beings on God. This emphasis\nmanifests itself primarily in the traditional doctrine of divine\nconcurrence, according to which God not only creates but also\ncontinually conserves finite minds and bodies in their existence. But\nMalebranche thinks this doctrine has an air of mystery to it, and\nfails to capture the magnitude and character of our dependence:\n\u2018that general and confused term concourse, by means of\nwhich we would explain creatures\u2019 dependence on God, rouses not\na single distinct idea in an attentive mind\u2019 (OC 1:440, LO 231).\nA proper conception of God entails that we depend on God in every way\npossible, not just ontologically but cognitively as well. Vision in\nGod is the only theory that does justice to the latter, for on this\naccount God not only causes us to see material objects but he is the\none in whom we see them: \u2018He is truly the mind\u2019s light and\nthe father of lights\u2019 (ibid.).\n\nThe view that created beings depend completely on God informs\nMalebranche\u2019s entire philosophy. Indeed, Malebranche\nacknowledges this at the end of the chapter we are discussing, where\nhe returns to the theme of dependence and invokes the words of St.\nPaul which he sees his philosophy as vindicating: \u2018In God we\nlive, move, and have our being\u2019 (Acts 17:28). It is sometimes\nsaid that Vision in God is the \u2018epistemological correlate\u2019\nof Malebranche\u2019s Occasionalism, according to which God is the\nonly true cause (McCracken 1983, 66; Nadler 1992, 141; Pyle 2003, 56).\nWhere Occasionalism stresses our dependence on God\u2019s power,\nVision in God underscores our dependence on his wisdom. Without God,\nwe are both causally and cognitively impotent. \n\n\nInfinite Cognitive Capacity: In his first argument,\nMalebranche appealed to the fact that we are capable of thinking of an\ninfinite number of things, at least in principle, and this is obvious\nhe thinks from considerations of mathematical objects, which are\ninfinite in number. The question raised by the third argument \u2013\nwhich Malebranche declares to be his \u2018strongest\u2019 \u2013\nis how this infinite capacity is possible. He might have ended the\nargument here by concluding that we must see all things in God, for a\nfinite mind is incapable of containing an infinity of beings. Instead,\nhe attempts to strengthen his case by observing a further wrinkle in\nthe nature of cognition. Malebranche asserts that whenever we desire\nto think of some particular object we must first survey all beings and\nthen focus on the object we wish to think about. If we did not already\nhave at least a general and confused apprehension of the object we\nwished to consider, then we could not direct our attention to it.\nMalebranche takes this to be a datum of our experience, but the\nunderlying principle is of Platonic origin. Plato famously argues in\nthe Meno that all knowledge is recollection, for it is\nimpossible to inquire about that of which one is ignorant. One must be\nat least dimly aware of all things one seeks to know, and thus\nlearning is more like remembering than discovering something entirely\nnew (cf. McCracken 1983, 66). Augustine (On the Teacher10.33)\nhad already adapted this argument for his own ends, and here\nMalebranche is following suit.\n\nSo each of us is capable of thinking of an infinite number of things\nand, more importantly, in thinking of any particular thing one must\ngrasp this infinity. It is at this point that Malebranche concludes\n(for the reason given above) that this infinity of beings must be in\nGod, and that it is only through our union with God that these beings\nare present to us in thought. How does God contain this infinity? Not\nby literally being composed of an infinity of particular ideas, for\nagain God is perfectly simple. On Malebranche\u2019s conception, God\nis \u2018being in general,\u2019 \u2018infinite being,\u2019 or\n\u2018being without restriction\u2019 (3.2.8, OC 1:456; LO 241). In\nhim, \u2018all beings [are] contained in one\u2019 precisely because\nhe is infinite and indeterminate. This point allows him to further\nclarify the nature of cognition: \u2018not only does the mind have\nthe idea of the infinite, it even has it before that of the\nfinite\u2026. In order for us to conceive of a finite being,\nsomething must necessarily be eliminated from this general notion of\nbeing, which consequently must come first\u2019 (3.2.6, OC 1:441; LO\n232). Here Malebranche follows Descartes in affirming that the idea of\nthe infinite is conceptually prior to the idea of the finite, but then\nadds a twist that pushes him away from Descartes (and closer to\nSpinoza), namely that we conceive particular things by limiting or\nnegating the idea of the infinite. \n\n\nCausal Efficacy: In this argument, Malebranche begins by\nnoting that ideas are causally efficacious \u2018since they act upon\nthe mind and enlighten it\u2019 and \u2018make it happy or unhappy\nthrough pleasant or unpleasant perceptions by which they affect\nit\u2019 (3.2.6, OC 1:442; LO 232). To establish that these ideas are\nin God, he then invokes an Augustinian principle, namely that\n\u2018nothing can act immediately upon the mind unless it is superior\nto it.\u2019 To make sense of this principle, one must envisage, as\nAugustine did, a hierarchy of being in which minds are higher than\nbodies and God constitutes the upper limit of moral perfection. For\nMalebranche, these are the only substances there are. So it follows\nthat only God can act on the soul and, insofar as they are\nefficacious, ideas must be the very substance of God. \n\n\nThe Purpose of Creation: In his final argument, Malebranche\nappeals once again to creation, focusing this time on its purpose. He\nmaintains that as an absolutely perfect being, God can act only for\nhis own glory. There is nothing that he lacks for which created beings\nsomehow compensate. Thus, God created the universe so that his works\nwould reflect his perfections and, as much as possible, be directed\ntoward him. As conscious beings whose thoughts point beyond\nthemselves, minds are especially well suited to this purpose for only\nthey are capable of knowing his perfections. But don\u2019t we know\nother things besides God? Yes, Malebranche will answer, but given\nGod\u2019s aim in creation we can know his works only if we also see\nhim to some extent (3.2.6, OC 1:442\u20133; LO 233). Vision in God\nsatisfies this requirement, for it affirms that we see all things in\nGod by way of ideas that are identical with his substance. \n\n",
