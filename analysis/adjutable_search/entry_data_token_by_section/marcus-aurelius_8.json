Conclusion\n\n\nAs mentioned above (1.1), Marcus\u2019 Meditations touch on many more\ntopics than the ones addressed here, but we get further in\nunderstanding Marcus if we focus on a topic and see how his remarks on\nthat topic are related to his overall project of reminding himself how\na Stoic should live. It would be worth working this out for others of\nhis frequent remarks, such as that we are tiny and temporary fragments\nin the cosmos, that death takes us all in the end, that we ought to\nlive purposively rather than like mechanical toys.\n",
