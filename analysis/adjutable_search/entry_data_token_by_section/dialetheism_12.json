    "main_text": "Objections to Dialetheism || The Argument from Exclusion\n4.2 The Argument from Exclusion\n\nThere are several objections to dialetheism involving the notion of\nexclusion. The very rough idea is that dialetheists have let\nin more truths than non-dialetheists, but subsequently now\nhave trouble keeping enough falisity out. This objection, in\none form or another, has been a recurring theme in criticisms of\ndialetheism. \n\nA version of the argument from exclusion against dialetheism found,\nfor instance, in McTaggart 1922 (see Berto 2006, 2012) is as follows.\nA sentence is meaningful only if it rules something out. But if the\nLNC fails, \\(A\\) does not rule out \\(\\neg A\\), or, a\nfortiori, anything else. Hence meaningful language presupposes\nthe LNC.\n\nThere are problems one may find with this argument. One is that even\nthough a dialetheia does not rule out its negation, it still may rule\nout several other things. A bigger trouble is that the first premise\nlooks to be simply false. Consider again the sentence\n\u2018Everything is true\u2019. This entails everything, and so\nrules out nothing. Yet it is meaningful. It is something that\neveryone, except a trivialist, rejects.\n\nOne might attempt a more sophisticated explanation of the notion of\nruling out, for instance in terms of information theory, or\nperhaps possible worlds. One may claim that a statement \u2018rules\nout\u2019 something insofar as there are situations, or worlds, at\nwhich it fails. In this sense, \u2018Everything is true\u2019 does\nrule something out. But now, it is this account of propositional\nmeaning which can be challenged in general. If mathematical truths\nhave a strictly necessary status (which may safely be assumed here),\nFermat\u2019s Last Theorem rules out nothing: being a necessary\ntruth, it holds at all possible worlds. But it is perfectly\nmeaningful; people wondered whether it was true or false for\ncenturies; and its proof by Andrew Wiles was a substantial\ndiscovery.\n\nOne argument from exclusion, with a more ad hominem twist,\nclaims that the dialetheist has trouble with expressing\ndisagreement with rival positions in debates (see Parsons 1990,\nShapiro 2004, Littman and Simmons 2004). For when the dialetheist\nutters \u2018\\(\\neg A\\)\u2019, this is in itself insufficient to\nrule out that \\(A\\) is the case, given that, in a dialetheic world, it\nmay well be that both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\). Similarly, \u2018\\(A\\) is\nfalse\u2019 and even \u2018\\(A\\) is not true\u2019 might not do the\ntrick, since for the dialetheist some \\(A\\)\u2019s being false, or\nuntrue, does not rule out its being true. As Parsons puts it,\n\nSuppose that you say \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 and Priest replies\n\u2018\\(\\neg A\\)\u2019. Under ordinary circumstances you would think\nthat he had disagreed with you. But then you remember that Priest is a\ndialetheist, and it occurs to you that he might very well agree with\nyou after all\u2014since he might think that \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are\nboth true. How can he indicate that he genuinely disagrees\nwith you? The natural choice is for him to say \u2018\\(A\\) is not\ntrue\u2019. However, the truth of this assertion is also consistent\nwith \\(A\\)\u2019s being true\u2014for a dialetheist, anyway (Parsons\n1990, p. 345).\n\n\nElaborations and repetitions of this line of thought have come to be\nknown in the literature as the \u2018just true\u2019 or \u2018true\nonly\u2019 problem, e.g. Rossberg 2013. (Young 2015, however, argues\nthat the exclusion problem is distinct from the just-true problem.)\n\n\nTo this, the dialetheist has various replies. Priest has argued that\nthe logical operation of negation should be distinguished from the\nspeech acts of denial and the cognitive state of rejection. So, contra\nFrege, assertion of a negation is not the same as denial. The idea is\nthat exclusion is expressed via a primitive notion of\nrejection: to reject \\(A\\) is to positively refuse to believe\nthat \\(A\\). That the notion is taken as primitive means, in\nparticular, that it is not reducible to the acceptance of negation: it\nis a sui generis act. The linguistic counterpart of rejection\nis the speech act of denial. Then the dialetheist can rule out that\n\\(A\\) is the case by denying \\(A\\); and this does not amount to the\nassertion of \\(\\neg A\\) (Priest 2006, Ch. 6). More simply, one can\noften express denials by uttering ordinary language negations:\n\u2018not\u2019 is, in this sense, pragmatically ambiguous.\nWe will come back below to how, and why, rejection-denial may not be\nreducible to the acceptance-assertion of any negation.\n\nAnother way in which the dialetheist may express the exclusion that\n\\(A\\) is the case is by uttering \u2018\\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\)\u2019,\nwhere again \\(\\bot\\) is \u2018Everything is true\u2019. Similarly, a\ndialetheist may try to fix that \\(A\\) is consistent by saying\n\u2018if \\(A\\) is both true and false, then \\(\\bot\\)\u2019.\nConsiderations by e.g. Field (2008, Ch. 27), Murzi and Carrara (2013),\nand Berto (2014), however, cast doubt on whether\n\u2018arrow-falsum\u2019 can work as a dialetheic\nexclusion-expressing device in all cases. One reason is due to\nside-effects of the aforementioned Curry paradox. Another is that\n\u2018arrow-falsum\u2019 is very strong; a mundane sentence\nlike \u2018Alice had spaghetti for dinner\u2019 may be false-only\n(she didn\u2019t), but if it were true too, that wouldn\u2019t be\nabsurd. Cf. Beall 2013, proposing exclusion via non-logical,\ntheory-specific rules of the form \\(A,\\neg A \\vdash \\bot\\)\nfor each sentence \\(A\\) we take to be consistent; Scharp 2018 suggests\npossible problems for this approach. \n\nThe exclusion problem gets its strength from some background\nassumptions. Specifically, it seems to presuppose that the content of\na proposition is given in terms of splitting all possible situations,\nor worlds, into those where the proposition holds and those where it\ndoes not. Even accepting this presupposition, though, would not affect\na dialetheic challenge to the LNC. For a given \\(A\\) to be a\ndialetheia, putting things in these terms, it is sufficient that there\nbe overlap between the worlds where \\(A\\) holds, and those where its\nnegation holds. And this is compatible with the idea of propositional\ncontent as splitting the totality of worlds\u2014but now with\noverlap. The tenability of such an overlap, though, requires\ndiscussing the account of negation from classical logic, to which we\nnow turn.\n",
