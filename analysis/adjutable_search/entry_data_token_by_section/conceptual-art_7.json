    "main_text": "Five Philosophical Themes || The Ontology and Media of Art\n3.2 The Ontology and Media of Art\n\nThe claim that conceptual art is to be identified less with a\nperceivable object than with the meaning or idea it aims to convey,\ngives rise to a host of complex ontological questions. The rejection\nof traditional artistic media, together with the de-materialisation of\nthe art object, forces us to reconsider what seemed to be relatively\nuncomplicated aspects of artistic experience. The answers to questions\nsuch as \u2018Is there in fact any one thing (or set of things) that\nwe must perceive in artistic appreciation?\u2019, and \u2018Is it a\nnecessary condition for the existence of an artwork that it have a\nmedium?\u2019 suddenly become a good deal less obvious.\n\nIn the first instance, conceptual art drives us to review the common\nassumption that appropriate appreciation and engagement with an\nartwork must involve a direct first-hand experience of that piece\nitself. The idea here, to use Frank Sibley\u2019s words, is that\n\n[p]eople have to see the grace or unity of a work,\nhear the plaintiveness or frenzy in the music,\nnotice the gaudiness of colour scheme, feel the\npower of a novel, its mood, or its uncertainty of tone. They may be\nstruck by these qualities at once, or they may come to perceive them\nonly after repeated viewings, hearings, or readings, and with the help\nof critics. But unless they do perceive them for themselves, aesthetic\nenjoyment, appreciation, and judgement are beyond them\u2026 the\ncrucial thing is to see, hear, or feel. (Sibley 1965, 137).\n\n\nThe assumption in question is, then, that although we seem to gain\nsomething from looking at, for example, a postcard or poster of\nKatsushika Hokusai's Fine Wine, Clear Morning\u00a0or\n\u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun\u2019s Self-Portrait in a\nStraw Hat , a genuine judgement about its artistic character\nnecessitates one\u2019s own un-mediated perceptual experience of it.\nBut \u2013 and herein lies the crux of the problem for conceptual art\n\u2013 what if there is nothing for us to get a first-hand perceptual\nexperience of? In the case of Walter De Maria\u2019s Vertical\nEarth Kilometer\n (1977)[6],\n a kilometre-long metal shaft plunged into the surface of the earth so\nthat only the very top is visible, first-hand perceptual experience is\nsimply not something that can be had. More pertinently, what does it\neven mean to have a perceptual engagement with an artwork that claims,\nbasically, to be an idea?\n\nPerhaps the most pressing question, however, has to do with the extent\nto which we are to take conceptual art\u2019s claim of\nde-materialisation seriously. Does the de-materialisation of such art\nnot suggest that there is not only a rejection of traditional artistic\nmedia in conceptual art, but an outright refutation of artistic media\nin general? One possible way of making sense of this idea is with a\ndistinction outlined by Davies, namely that between physical\nmedium and vehicular medium (Davies 2004). Crucially, a\nvehicular medium is said to incorporate not only physical objects\n(such as paintings and sculptures, say) but also actions, events, and\ngenerally more complex entities. In Davies\u2019 words, \u2018[t]he\nproduct of an artist\u2019s manipulation of a vehicular medium will\nthen be the vehicle whereby a particular artistic statement\nis articulated\u2026 The vehicle may, as in the case of\nPicasso\u2019s Guernica, be a physical object, or, as in the\ncase of Coleridge\u2019s Kubla Kahn, a linguistic\nstructure-type, or, as arguably in the case of Duchamp\u2019s\nFountain, an action of a particular kind.\u2019 (Davies\n2004, 59). Adhering to this vehicular medium in art, may then at least\nequip philosophers with a notion that can deflate the concern of\nwhether conceptual art, by rejecting physical media, denies the need\nfor all artistic media.\n\nClearly, conceptual art is not the first kind of art to raise\nontological concerns of this kind. After all, music and literary art,\nbe it traditional or avant-garde, hardly present\nstraightforward cases either. The question of what exactly\nconstitutes, say, a novel or a musical work have been widely discussed\nfor some time (e.g. Davies 2001; Ingarden 1973; Wollheim 1980)\nBuilding on the suggestion that artworks such as musical pieces and\nliterary works are best understood in terms of universals or\n\u2018types\u2019, one view that has been widely discussed in the\nlast two decades or so is based on the idea that not only musical and\nliterary artworks, but all artworks, are types. More\nspecifically, they are to be conceived of as \u2018event- or\naction-types\u2019 (Currie 1988). According to this theory, the\nartwork is thus not the material thing itself but, rather, the way in\nwhich the artist arrived at the underlying structure shared by all\ninstances or performances of that work.\n\nWhilst the general approach fostered by both Currie and Davies is\nclearly congenial to some aspects of conceptual art, it might\nnevertheless still be the case that further work needs to be done if\nthe view that artworks are basically event- or action-types is to\naccommodate all art in the conceptual tradition. Further questions\ninclude what role, if any, is played by the (set of) material thing(s)\nthat many conceptual artists undeniably do present us with.\nWhat, in other words, are we to make of the object (be it a human body\nor a video-recording) that is supposed to transmit the idea which, in\nturn, is said to be the genuine artwork? A good philosophical\nexplanation needs to be given as to how the material thing that is\nregularly presented to the audience is, in fact, relevant to the\nartwork itself. Is the vehicular medium constitutive of the artwork,\nand if so, how exactly does that square with the claim of\nde-materialisation?\n",
