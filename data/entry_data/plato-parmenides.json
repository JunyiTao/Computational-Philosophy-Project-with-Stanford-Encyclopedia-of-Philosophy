    "preamble": "\n\n\nThe Parmenides is, quite possibly, the most enigmatic of\nPlato\u2019s dialogues. The dialogue recounts an almost certainly\nfictitious conversation between a venerable Parmenides (the Eleatic\nMonist) and a youthful Socrates, followed by a dizzying array of\ninterconnected arguments presented by Parmenides to a young and\ncompliant interlocutor named \u201cAristotle\u201d (not the\nphilosopher, but rather a man who became one of the Thirty Tyrants\nafter Athens\u2019 surrender to Sparta at the conclusion of the\nPeloponnesian War). Most commentators agree that Socrates articulates\na version of the theory of forms defended by his much older namesake\nin the dialogues of Plato\u2019s middle period, that Parmenides\nmounts a number of potentially devastating challenges to this theory,\nand that these challenges are followed by a piece of intellectual\n\u201cgymnastics\u201d consisting of eight strings of arguments\n(Deductions) that are in some way designed to help us see how to\nprotect the theory of forms against the challenges. Beyond this, there\nis precious little scholarly consensus. Commentators disagree about\nthe proper way to reconstruct Parmenides\u2019 challenges, about the\noverall logical structure of the Deductions, about the main subject of\nthe Deductions, about the function of the Deductions in relation to\nthe challenges, and about the final philosophical moral of the\ndialogue as a whole.\n\n\nThe Parmenides inspired the metaphysical and mystical\ntheories of the later Neoplatonists (notably Plotinus and later,\nProclus), who saw in the Deductions the key to the hierarchical\nontological structure of the universe.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Overview of the Dialogue\n\n\nPlato\u2019s Parmenides consists in a critical examination\nof the theory of forms, a set of metaphysical and epistemological\ndoctrines articulated and defended by the character Socrates in the\ndialogues of Plato\u2019s middle period (principally Phaedo,\nRepublic II\u2013X, Symposium). According to this\ntheory, there is a single, eternal, unchanging, indivisible, and\nnon-sensible form corresponding to every predicate or property.\nThe theoretical function of these forms is to explain why things\n(particularly, sensible things) have the properties they do.\nThus, it is by virtue of being in some way related to (i.e., by\nparticipating in, or partaking of) the form of beauty that beautiful\nthings (other than beauty) are beautiful, it is by virtue of partaking\nof the form of largeness that large things are large, and so on.\nFundamental to this theory is the claim that forms are separate from\n(at least in the sense of being not identical to) the things that\npartake of them.\n\n\nIn the metaphysics of his middle period, Plato does not provide a\ntheory of the nature of the partaking relation. But in the\nParmenides, Plato considers two accounts of the partaking\nrelation. According to the first \u201cPie Model\u201d account,\nfor X to partake of Y is for the whole or a part\nof Y to be in X (as a part of X). According\nto the second \u201cParadigmatistic\u201d account, for X to\npartake of Y is for X to resemble Y. In the\nfirst part of the dialogue, Plato sets out reasons for thinking that,\non either of these accounts of partaking, the theory of forms is\ninternally inconsistent.\n\n\nImmediately following these criticisms, Plato describes a general\nmethod of training designed to save the forms. The method\nconsists of a series of eight Deductions (with an Appendix to the first\ntwo) focusing on consequences that may be derived from positing the\nbeing of a particular form and consequences that may be derived from\npositing the non-being of that form.\n\n\nIn the second part of the dialogue, Plato instantiates this method,\ntaking the form, the one, as his example. Plato shows, in\nparticular, that whether the one is or is not, the one (and also things\nother than the one: the others) have none of a series of pairs\nof contrary properties (whole/divided, in motion/at rest,\nsame/different, like/unlike, equal/unequal, older/younger). Plato\nalso shows that, whether the one is or is not, the one (and also the\nothers) have (or, at least, appear to have) all of these\ncontrary properties.\n2. The Introductory Section: Zeno\u2019s Argument 126a\u2013128e\n\n\nThe dialogue\u2019s narrator is Cephalus, who has just arrived in\nAthens after a trip from his home in Clazomenae. Cephalus runs\ninto Plato\u2019s half brothers, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and asks them\nto confirm the existence of someone who has completely memorized a\nconversation that Parmenides and Zeno once had with Socrates.\nAdeimantus confirms that his half brother, Antiphon, can recite the\nconversation in toto, having heard it from a friend of\nZeno\u2019s, Pythodorus, in whose house the conversation took\nplace. Cephalus, Adeimantus, and Glaucon then pay a visit to\nAntiphon, who, after a bit of prodding, agrees to replay the\nconversation. As most scholars agree, the conversation putatively\nrecorded by Pythodorus, passed on to Antiphon, and then recounted to\nCephalus, is almost certainly fictitious. This hypothesis partly\nexplains why Plato chose to frame the dialogue at third\nremove.\n\n\nAs Antiphon tells the story, the noted Eleatic philosophers, Parmenides\n(then around 65 years old) and Zeno (then around 40 years old), have\ncome to Athens for the Great Panathenaea. Having heard of their\narrival, a youthful Socrates (then around 20 years old) and some\nfriends of his have come to Pythodorus\u2019s house to listen to Zeno\nread from his book. At the end of Zeno\u2019s performance,\nPythodorus, Parmenides, and Aristotle, who have been waiting outside\nthe house, return and witness an exchange between Zeno and\nSocrates.\n\n\nThe exchange begins with Socrates\u2019 summary of the general\nstructure of one of Zeno\u2019s arguments:\n\nIf the things that are are many, then they are both like and\nunlike.\nNothing can be both like and unlike.\n\nSo,\n\nThe things that are are not many.\n\n\n\nZeno then explains that he intends this argument as a kind of\ndefense of Parmenides\u2019 monism: just as others have argued that\nmonism leads to absurd results (Zeno may be thinking here of the sorts\nof absurdities mentioned by Plato at Sophist 244b\u2013245e), so\npluralism suffers consequences that are, if anything, even more\nabsurd.\n3. Socrates\u2019 Speech: The Theory of Forms 128e\u2013130a\n\n\nSocrates then objects to Zeno\u2019s argument by denying premise\n(2). His lengthy objection depends on the theory of forms\narticulated in Plato\u2019s middle period\ndialogues.\n\n\nOne of the main principles of this theory is Causality\n(Phaedo 100c4\u20136, 100d7\u20138, 100e5\u20136,\n101b4\u20136, 101c4\u20135):\n\n\n(Causality) Things that are F\n(other than the F) are F by virtue of partaking of\nthe F.\n\n\nAnother crucial principle is Separation (Phaedo 75c11\u2013d2,\n100b6\u20137; Republic 476b10, 480a11):\n\n\n(Separation) The F is itself by itself, at\nleast in the sense of being separate from, and hence not identical\nwith, the things that partake of it.\n\n\nAccording to Separation, like things are like by partaking of a\nseparate form of likeness and unlike things are unlike by partaking of\na separate form of unlikeness. Although the properties of being\nlike and being unlike are contraries, they are not\ncontradictories. As Socrates emphasizes, it is possible for\nsensible things to partake of both likeness and unlikeness, and hence\nbe both like and unlike.\n\n\nSocrates does not explain how this is supposed to be possible, but\nwe can extract an explanation from what he says later in his speech\nabout the properties of being one and being many, and from what the\nPhaedo tells us about the properties of being tall and\nshort. At Parmenides 129c, Socrates claims that he\nhimself is one (being one among the seven persons who are present) and\nmany (in having many parts: right/left, front/back, upper/lower).\nAt Phaedo 102b ff., Socrates points out that Simmias is taller\nthan Socrates (and hence tall), but that Simmias is also shorter than\nPhaedo (and hence short). Thus, Simmias is both tall and\nshort. Clearly Socrates envisages the possibility of sensible\nthings being both like in one way and unlike in another. For\nexample, Socrates is like Plato (in that each is a philosopher) and\nunlike Meletus (in that one, but not the other, is a poet). Being\nlike Plato, Socrates is like. Being unlike Meletus, Socrates is\nunlike. Hence Socrates is both like and unlike. The general\nprinciple here is Impurity-S:\n\n\n(Impurity-S)   Sensible things are impure\ninasmuch as they can (and, in fact, often do) have contrary properties.\n\n\n\nIt follows from Impurity-S that premise (2) of Zeno\u2019s argument\nis false. But Socrates is willing to grant that Zeno is not\nentirely mistaken. He insists that although it is far from\nsurprising to be told that sensible things have contrary properties, he\nwould be astonished to learn that forms have contrary\nproperties. Socrates, then, holds that forms are pure,\nin the following sense:\n\n\n(Purity-F) Forms\ncannot have contrary properties.\n\n\nAccording to Purity-F, not only is it the case that the one cannot\nbe both one and many and the like cannot be both like and unlike, but\nit is also the case that the one cannot be both like and unlike and the\nlike cannot be both one and many. (Notice that Purity-F and\nImpurity-S together entail Non-Identity, the claim that no form is\nidentical to any sensible thing. A similar form of argument\nappears at Phaedo 74b\u2013c, a passage in which Socrates argues\nthat whereas sensible things that are equal are also unequal, the equal\nis not unequal, and hence the equal is not identical to any equal\nsensible thing.)\n\n\nSocrates\u2019 speech therefore articulates some of the basic elements\nof the theory of forms, namely Causality and Separation, along with\nImpurity-S and Purity-F. The theory to which Socrates alludes is\nricher than his brief description of it suggests. As the dialogue\nproceeds, the interlocutors invoke a number of additional middle period\nprinciples. One principle that plays an important role in the\nsequel is One-over-Many (see Republic 596a6\u20137):\n\n\n(One-over-Many) For any\nplurality of F things, there is a form of F-ness by\nvirtue of partaking of which each member of the plurality is\nF.\n\n\nIt is from this principle that Plato infers, by means of the Third\nBed Argument (Republic 597c1\u2013d3), the principle of\nUniqueness:\n\n\n(Uniqueness)\nFor any property F, there is exactly one form of F-ness.\n\n\n(Notice that the conjunction of One-over-Many and Uniqueness entails\nCausality.) The sequel also depends on yet another important\nmiddle period principle, Self-Predication:\n\n\n(Self-Predication) For\nany property F, the F is F.\n\n\nFor example, the beautiful is beautiful (Euthydemus 301b5,\nCratylus 439d5\u20136, Hippias Major\n292e6\u20137). It is clear that the point generalizes to all\nproperties, including the property of being large (see Phaedo\n100c4\u20136, 102e5\u20136).  (Notice that Purity-F and\nSelf-Predication together entail the principle that the F\ncannot possess the property that is contrary to F, instances\nof which appear throughout the middle dialogues (Hippias\nMajor 291d1\u20133, Phaedo 102e5\u20136) and in\nSocrates\u2019 speech (Parmenides 129b1\u20133, 129b6\u2013c1).)\nAnd finally, the sequel also repeatedly refers to the principle of\nOneness:\n\n\n(Oneness) Each form is\none.\n\n\nOneness and Uniqueness are different principles: to say that a form\nis one is to say not that it is unique, but rather\nthat it is something that can be counted. For Plato infers the\noneness of the beautiful from the fact that the beautiful and the ugly\nare two, the oneness of the large from the fact that the large and the\nsmall are two, and so on (Republic 475e9\u2013476a6,\n524b3\u20139). Thus the sense in which each form is one is similar to\nthe sense in which Socrates is one, in being one among many\n(Parmenides 129c8\u2013d2).\n4. Problems for the Theory of Forms 130a\u2013134e\n\n\nAt the conclusion of Socrates\u2019 speech, Parmenides articulates\nsix different lines of criticism directed at the theory of forms.\n4.1 The Extent of the Forms 130a\u2013e\n\n\nParmenides begins by questioning Socrates\u2019 initial acceptance\nof the claim that there is a separate form corresponding to\nevery predicate or property. Socrates expresses\nconfidence in the existence of separate forms of justice, beauty,\ngoodness, and every form of that sort, uncertainty about the existence\nof separate forms of humanity, fire, and water, and outright skepticism\nabout the existence of separate forms for hair, mud, and\ndirt.\n\n\nIt is unclear why Socrates finds himself in doubt about the\nexistence of forms for natural kinds (such as humans and water) and\nstuffs or mixtures (such as hair and mud). For some commentators,\nSocrates simply makes \u201ca wrong admission\u201d as a result of\nhis youth and inexperience (Allen 1997, 124; see also Sayre 1996,\n74). After all, Plato alludes to a form of bee at Meno 72b\u2013c,\na form of shuttle at Cratylus 389d, and forms of bed and of\ntable at Republic 596b. Although shuttles, tables, and beds\nare artifacts, and hence perhaps relevantly different from natural\nkinds, such as human beings and water, there seems no reason to think\nthat humans differ from bees in regard to whether they have\ncorresponding forms. However, it is difficult to understand why\nPlato would pen a conversation in which a character who\nembodies his own middle period theory would admit something he has no\ngood reason to admit.\n\n\nOne possibility (see Gill 1996, 22) is that Plato is alluding to the\nmiddle period thesis that only certain types of properties summon the\nunderstanding to think about forms. For example, in the\nRepublic, Socrates claims that whereas \u201cthe\nsoul isn\u2019t compelled to ask the understanding what a finger is,\nsince sight doesn\u2019t suggest to it that a finger is at the same\ntime the opposite of a finger\u201d (523d2\u20136), the soul is compelled\nto ask what the large is and what the small is when sight suggests to\nit that the index finger is both big (relative to the pinky) and small\n(relative to the middle finger). If forms were merely posited to\nexplain the compresence of contrary properties in sensible things, then\nthere would be no need to posit a form corresponding to properties\n(such as water and dirt) that have no contraries. However, this\nis unlikely to be the source of Socrates\u2019 worry here, for the\nRepublic passage does not discuss metaphysical reasons for\npositing the existence of forms, but rather discusses the psychological\nand epistemic question of what prompts the soul to think of forms that\nhave already been posited.\n\n\nAnother option (Rickless 2007, 54\u201355; see also Miller 1986, 46) is that\nPlato means us to recognize a tension between Self-Predication and\nSeparation (or Non-Identity) in the theory of forms. On the one\nhand, the fact that justice is just, beauty beautiful, and goodness\ngood does not suggest that justice, beauty, and goodness are concrete,\nsensible things. That is, Self-Predication gives us no reason to\ndeny that justice, beauty, and goodness are separate forms, numerically\ndistinct from sensible things. By contrast, if there are forms\nfor human and mud, then Self-Predication requires that the human be a\nhuman being and the mud be muddy. It is difficult to see how\nhuman things and muddy things could be non-sensible. So\nSelf-Predication gives us at least some reason to deny that there is a\nform for human and mud that is distinct from every sensible\nthing. This interpretation meshes well with Socrates\u2019\nremark that hair, mud, and dirt \u201care in fact just what we\nsee\u201d and that it is for this reason that \u201cit\u2019s too\noutlandish to think there is a form for them\u201d\n(Parmenides 130d3\u20135).\n4.2 The Whole-Part Dilemma 130e\u2013131e\n\n\nAfter leading Socrates to worry about whether there is indeed a form\ncorresponding to every property, Parmenides derives a number of\nabsurdities from the result of combining the theory of forms with a\nparticular conception of the partaking relation, the Pie Model.\nAccording to the Pie Model, participants literally get a share of the\nforms of which they partake, in a way analogous to the way in which\nthose who partake of a pie literally get a share of the pie. The\nPie Model comes in two versions: according to the Whole Pie Model, for\nX to partake of Y is for X to get the whole\nof Y as its share of Y (i.e., for the whole\nof Y to be in X); according to the Piece-of-Pie\nModel, for X to partake of Y is for X to\nget a (proper) part of Y as its share of Y (i.e.,\nfor a (proper) part of Y to be in X). What\nParmenides goes on to argue is that the theory of forms is internally\ninconsistent on either version of the Pie Model.\n\n\nSuppose, first, that partaking conforms to the Whole Pie Model.  Now\nimagine that there are at one time three sensible F\nthings, A, B, and C, each separate from\neach of the others. According to Causality, each\nof A, B, C is F by virtue of\npartaking of the F, and hence each\nof A, B, C partakes of\nthe F. Given the Whole Pie Model, it follows that\nthe F is, as a whole and at a single time, in each\nof A, B, C. Thus, the whole of\nthe F is in A, the whole of the F is\nin B, and the whole of the F is\nin C. If A, B, and C are in\nseparate places, then Causality and the Whole Pie Model together\nrequire that one and the same form be, as a whole, in separate places\nat the same time. Parmenides concludes that, on this picture, the\nrelevant form would be \u201cseparate from itself\u201d\n(Parmenides 131b2).\n\n\nOn some interpretations (Meinwald 1991, 13\u201314; Allen 1997, 130;\nRickless 2007, 57\u201358), Plato thinks of the claim that a form is\nseparate from itself as an absurdity in itself. On other\ninterpretations (Teloh 1981, 155; Miller 1986, 48; Sayre 1996, 76),\nPlato does not treat this result as absurd in itself. Absurdity\nonly arises when this result is combined with the further thought that\nnothing that is separate from itself could be a single thing. (In\nthis case, the same form would have to be three things, rather than one\nthing.) For the claim that the relevant form is not one\ncontradicts Oneness, the claim that every form is one.\n\n\nSocrates tries to avoid the relevant absurdity, however it is\nunderstood, by supposing that a form is like a day, in the following\nsense: just as a day can be in many separate places at the same time\nwithout being separate from itself, so a form can be in many separate\nplaces at the same time without being separate from itself.\nParmenides does not think much of Socrates\u2019 suggestion. He\nimmediately counters that Socrates\u2019 day is like a sail: a day can\nbe in many separate places at the same time only inasmuch as different\nparts of it are over the separate places, just as a sail can cover many\nseparate people only inasmuch as each person is covered by a different\npart of the sail. Parmenides\u2019 point, then, is that the only\nway to make sense of Socrates\u2019 day analogy is to reduce it to the\nPiece-of-Pie Model, the very model against which Parmenides goes on to\nargue.\n\n\nA number of scholars have balked at Parmenides\u2019 assimilation of\nthe day analogy to the sail analogy (Cherniss 1932, 135; Peck 1953,\n132; Crombie 1963, 330\u2013331; Sprague 1967, 96; Miller 1986, 49\u201350; Sayre\n1996, 76). They have assumed that, whether a day is thought of as\na time-interval or as the sun\u2019s rays (the light of day), it is in\nfact possible for one and the same day to be in separate places at the\nsame time. However, it does not in fact make sense to suppose\nthat a time-interval is in separate places at the same time\n(Rickless 2007, 58). And it is not in fact true that the same\npacket of rays shines on the separate places bathed by the light of\nday; rather, different packets of rays shine on different places\n(Panagiotou 1987, 18). Moreover, it makes little sense to suppose\nthat Plato would introduce a way out of the dilemma he himself has\nconstructed without explicitly alerting his readers to that fact.\nTo suppose otherwise would be to defend a particularly esoteric reading\nof Plato\u2019s intentions.\n\n\nHaving assimilated Socrates\u2019 day analogy to the Piece-of-Pie Model,\nParmenides turns to a criticism of this second version of the Pie\nModel. Suppose, then, the same three sensible F\nthings\u2014A, B, and C\u2014in separate\nplaces at the same time. According to Causality, A,\nB, and C are F by virtue of partaking of\nthe F, and hence A, B, and C\npartake of the F. Given the Piece-of-Pie Model, there is a\npart of the F in each of A, B, and\nC. If the same absurdity generated from the Whole Pie Model\nis to be avoided, we must suppose that the part of the F that\nis in A is numerically distinct from the part of the\nF that is in B and from the part of the F\nthat is in C, and also that the part of the F that\nis in B must be numerically distinct from the part of the\nF that is in C. (Otherwise we would have the same\npart of the F existing, as a whole, in separate places at the\nsame time; and hence we would have something that is separate from\nitself.) Thus the F must have numerically distinct parts, and\nmust therefore be divided (or, at least, divisible). Parmenides\nconcludes from this that the F cannot be one, a conclusion\nthat clearly contradicts Oneness.\n\n\nAlthough many commentators take it for granted that Parmenides\u2019\nconclusion follows from the principle that divided (or divisible)\nthings automatically lose their unity, this supposition makes little\nsense in the wake of Socrates\u2019 speech. There Socrates\ninsisted that he himself is one (in being one among many) even though\nhe has many parts (front and back, upper and lower, and so on).\nSo Socrates does not suppose that it is true in general that a\nthing with parts cannot be one. The hypothesis that makes most\nsense of Socrates\u2019 admission at the end of Parmenides\u2019\ncriticism of the Piece-of-Pie Model that the F cannot be one is that\nSocrates is antecedently committed to Purity-F. For anything that\nhas many parts is ipso facto many (just as Socrates\u2019\nhaving many parts is sufficient for his being many), and yet, by\nPurity-F, no form can have contrary properties. Given that the\nproperty of being one and the property of being many are contraries, it\nfollows from Purity-F and the claim that the F is many that the F\ncannot be one (Rickless 2007, 59\u201360).\n\n\nThe upshot of the Whole-Part Dilemma is that absurdity or\ninconsistency follows from the theory of forms on either of the two\npossible versions of the Pie Model conception of\npartaking. If X\u2019s partaking of Y amounts to the\nwhole of Y being in X (the Whole Pie model), then\nCausality conjoined with the existence of sensible things in separate\nplaces at the same time entails the absurd conclusion that forms are\nseparate from themselves; but if X\u2019s partaking of Y\namounts to a part of Y being in X (the Piece-of-Pie\nModel), then Causality and Purity-F (along with the claim that having\nmany parts is sufficient for being many and the claim that being one\nand being many are contrary properties) are inconsistent with\nOneness.\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the Whole-Part Dilemma, Parmenides extracts four\nmore absurdities from the result of combining Causality with the\nPiece-of-Pie model:\n\nBy Causality, every F thing (other than the F)\nis F by partaking of the F. But, by the Piece-of-Pie\nModel, for X to partake of Y is for X to\nget a part of Y. Thus, every F thing (other than the\nF) is F by getting a part of the F. Now\nlet F be the property of being large. In that case, every\nlarge thing (other than the large) is large by getting a part of the\nlarge. But, Parmenides assumes, if X is a part of Y,\nthen X is smaller than Y (and Y is larger\nthan X), and hence X is (in some way) small. So\nevery large thing (other than the large) is large by getting something\nsmall. But this is absurd: as Socrates himself emphasizes\nat Phaedo 101b, it would be monstrous to say that something\nis made larger by something small. This is an instance of a general\nclaim we might call \u201cNo Causation by Contraries\u201d:\n\n\n(No Causation by Contraries) For any property F, nothing that\nis F could make something possess a property that is contrary\nto the property of being F.\n\nThe result of combining Causality with the Piece-of-Pie Model\nentails that equal things (other than the equal) are equal by getting a\npart of the equal. Given that any part of X must be smaller than\nX (see above), it follows that equal things (other than the\nequal) are equal by getting something that is smaller than the\nequal. But, Parmenides assumes, if X is smaller\nthan Y, then X is unequal to Y, and\nhence X is (in some way) unequal. So every equal thing (other\nthan the equal) is equal by getting something unequal. But, again by\nNo Causation by Contraries, this result is absurd: nothing that is\nunequal could make something be equal.\nThe result of combining Causality with the Piece-of-Pie Model\nentails that small things (other than the small) are small by getting\na part of the small. This result entails that if there are any small\nthings (as indeed there are), then the small must have parts. But\nif X is a part of Y, then Y is larger\nthan X (see above), and hence Y is (in some way)\nlarge. Consequently, the small must be large. But, by\nSelf-Predication, the small is small. So the small is both large and\nsmall. But this result contradicts Purity-F, according to which the\nsmall cannot have contrary properties, and hence cannot be both large\nand small.\nAs before, the result of combining Causality with the\nPiece-of-Pie Model entails that small things (other than the small)\nare small by getting a part of the small. But, Parmenides assumes,\nfor X to get Y is just for Y to be added\nto X. It follows that small things (other than the small) are\nsmall by having a part of the small added to them. But this is absurd:\nit is impossible to make something small by adding something\nto it.\n\n\n\nThese four quick arguments show that the result of combining Causality\nwith the Piece-of-Pie Model does not sit well with other aspects of\nthe theory of forms, in particular No Causation by Contraries (1 and\n2), and the conjunction of Purity-F and Self-Predication (3).\n4.3 The Third Man Argument 132a\u2013b\n\n\nPlato never refers to any argument as the \u201cThird\nMan\u201d. The moniker derives from Aristotle, who in various\nplaces (e.g., Metaphysics 990b17 = 1079a13, 1039a2;\nSophistical Refutations 178b36 ff.) discusses (something akin\nto) the argument at Parmenides 132a\u2013b in these terms.\n\n\nParmenides sets up the argument by pointing out that, according to the\ntheory of forms, Oneness is supposed to follow from\nOne-over-Many. (Some, e.g., Fine (1993, 204), claim that Plato\nmeans the sentence \u201ceach form is one\u201d to express\nUniqueness, not Oneness. But this is certainly not what a\nrelevantly similar sentence expresses at Republic 476a2\u20136 and\n524b7\u201311\u2014see above.) From the existence of a plurality of F\nthings and the fact that, for any such plurality P, there is a form of\nF-ness by virtue of partaking of which each member\nof P is F, it follows that there is one form\n\u201cover\u201d the many members of P (in the sense of\nbeing that by virtue of partaking of which each member of P\nis F). And given that anything that is one \u201cover\u201d\nmany is (in some sense) one, it follows that any form that has\nparticipants is one.\n\n\nThere is a vast literature on the Third Man argument, initiated by the\ngroundbreaking analysis of the reasoning in Vlastos (1954). (See,\namong others, Sellars (1955), Vlastos (1955), Geach (1956), Vlastos\n(1956), Cherniss (1957), Peck (1962), Moravcsik (1963), Strang (1963),\nVlastos (1969), Cohen (1971), Teloh and Louzecky (1972), Peterson\n(1973), Goldstein and Mannick (1978), Mann (1979), Mates (1979),\nPickering (1981), Teloh (1981, 158\u2013167), Waterlow (1982), Prior\n(1985, 64\u201375), Curd (1986), Sharvy (1986), Penner (1987,\n251\u2013299), Scaltsas (1989), Malcolm (1991, 47\u201353), Meinwald\n(1992), Scaltsas (1992), Fine (1993, 203\u2013241), McCabe (1994,\n84\u201387), Schweizer (1994), Frances (1996), Allen (1997,\n152\u2013167), Hunt (1997), Rickless (1998), Pelletier and Zalta\n(2000), and Rickless (2007, 64\u201375).) Most commentators agree\nthat the reasoning relies on at least three principles: One-over-Many,\nSelf-Predication, and Non-Identity (about which more anon). (Allen\n(1997, 163) accepts that the reasoning relies on the claim that the\nlarge is large\u2014an instance of Self-Predication, but denies that\nthe argument, when generalized to forms other than the large, relies\non Self-Predication.) They also agree that the reasoning generates an\ninfinite regress of forms of largeness, and that the argument could be\ngeneralized to generate an infinite regress of forms corresponding to\nany predicate. But commentators differ over why Plato takes the\nregress to be vicious or problematic, and what Plato would have\nrecommended as a way of avoiding the absurdity generated by the\nreasoning.\n\n\nParmenides generates the infinite regress as follows. Consider a\nplurality of large things, A, B, and C. By\nOne-over-Many, there is a form of largeness (call it\n\u201cL1\u201d) by virtue of partaking of\nwhich A, B, and C are large. By\nSelf-Predication, L1 is large. So there is now a new\nplurality of large things, A, B,\nC, and L1. Thus, by One-over-Many, there is a form\nof largeness (call it \u201cL2\u201d) by virtue of\npartaking of which A, B, C, and\nL1 are large. Hence L1 partakes of L2. At this point,\nParmenides assumes something like the following Non-Identity\nassumption:\n\n\n(Non-Identity)\nNo form is identical to anything that partakes of it.\n\n\n(Notice that Non-Identity follows directly from Separation.)  From the\nfact that L1 partakes of L2, Non-Identity entails\nthat L2 is numerically distinct from L1. Thus, there\nmust be at least two forms of largeness, L1\nand L2. But this is not all. By Self-Predication, L2\nis large. So there is now a new plurality of large\nthings, A, B, C, L1,\nand L2. Thus, by One-over-Many, there is a form of largeness\n(call it \u201cL3\u201d) by virtue of partaking of\nwhich A, B, C, L1, and L2\nare large. Hence L1 and L2 both partake\nof L3. But then, by Non-Identity, L3 is numerically\ndistinct from both L1 and L2. Thus, there must be at\nleast three forms of largeness, L1, L2,\nand L3. Repetition of this reasoning, based on One-over-Many,\nSelf-Predication, and Non-Identity, then generates an infinite\nhierarchy of forms of largeness, with each form partaking of every\nform that lies above it in the hierarchy.  (That is, for every m and n\nsuch that m<n, Lm partakes of Ln.)\n\n\nIn what way does the existence of an infinite regress of forms\nrepresent a problem for the theory of forms? One answer to this\nquestion (see Vlastos (1954, 328, fn. 12; 1955), Goldstein and Mannick\n(1978), Penner (1987, 279\u2013282), and Fine (1993, 204)) is that\nthe nature of the problem is fundamentally epistemic. On this view,\nthe theory of forms includes the thesis that, for any\nproperty F, the primary function of the F is to\nexplain the F-ness of F things, and hence to make it\npossible for humans to apprehend and know things as\nF. But, so the story goes, Plato assumes that an infinite\nregress of forms of F-ness, each of which explains\nthe F-ness of the forms of\nF-ness below it in the hierarchy, cannot explain the F-ness of the\noriginal plurality of F things: explanation must come to an end\nsomewhere. Although this interpretation makes sense of the\nepistemic language that Plato sprinkles throughout the Third Man\npassage, it does not make sense of the fact that Parmenides sets up the\nargument by pointing out that the oneness of the large follows from its\nbeing one \u201cover\u201d many large things (see above). So it\nis unlikely that the epistemic reading of the Third Man is what Plato\nhad in mind.\n\n\nOther scholars claim, quite correctly, that the existence of infinitely\nmany forms (indeed, the existence of so much as two forms)\ncorresponding to any predicate is inconsistent with Uniqueness.\nAnd, indeed, this result appears to be at least part of what the Third\nMan argument is designed to uncover. But Plato seems to be\nlooking to establish more than this. For in the last sentence of\nthe relevant passage, Parmenides announces that the argument shows that\neach form is no longer one, but infinitely many. Although most\ncommentators gloss this comment as the claim that there is no longer\none form per predicate, but rather infinitely many, this is not what\nthe sentence actually says. What the sentence suggests is that\nthe existence of infinitely many forms of largeness conflicts with\nOneness.\n\n\nOne way to make sense of this claim is by way of the following chain of\nreasoning. As we\u2019ve seen, One-over-Many, Self-Predication,\nand Non-Identity together generate an infinite hierarchy of forms of\nlargeness, each of which partakes of the forms above it in the\nhierarchy. Thus, L1 partakes of infinitely many forms, L2\npartakes of infinitely many forms, L3 partakes of infinitely many\nforms, and so on. Now there are passages in which Plato appears\nto assume that forms are as many as the predicates that can be truly\napplied to them (see Philebus 14c8\u2013d3, and Rickless (2007,\n71)). And if we assume that Parmenides is still working with the\nPiece-of-Pie model of partaking, then the fact that a form partakes of\ninfinitely many forms entails that it has infinitely many parts, and\nhence is itself infinitely many. So from the existence of an\ninfinite regress of forms and from what appear to be dialectically\nappropriate assumptions, it is possible to argue that each form in the\nhierarchy is infinitely many. Given that the property of being\none and the property of being many are contraries, it then follows\ndirectly from Purity-F that each form in the hierarchy is not\none. This interpretation explains why Parmenides announces at the\nend of the argument that each form is no longer one, but infinitely\nmany (see Rickless (2007, 64\u201375)).\n\n\nMany commentators think that the fundamental inconsistency revealed by\nthe Third Man argument rests with the combination of One-over-Many,\nSelf-Predication, and Non-Identity. For them, the Third Man\nrequires that Plato give up at least one of these principles. But\non the interpretation that best explains the set-up and final sentence\nof the passage, Plato need not give up any of these principles in order\nto avoid inconsistency: he can simply abandon Purity-F (and perhaps\nalso Uniqueness).\n4.4 Forms as Thoughts 132b\u2013c\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the Third Man argument, Socrates suggests that\nit might be possible to avoid all previous inconsistencies at the heart\nof the theory of forms by supposing that forms are thoughts that reside\nonly in minds. In what appears to be a severely truncated\nargument, Parmenides provides two sets of reasons for thinking that\nthis suggestion will not avoid absurdity either. (Allen (1997,\n174) argues that Parmenides only provides a single argument here, one\nthat most would identify as the second of two.)\n\n\nParmenides\u2019 first argument appears to have the following\nstructure. First, all thoughts have intentional objects: every thought\nis of something rather than nothing. Second, the object of\nany thought T is something that T thinks to be one\nover all the instances. But anything that is thought to be one over\nall the instances is a form. Parmenides concludes that the intentional\nobject of every thought is a form, and hence if every form is a\nthought then every form is a thought of a form. Although Parmenides\ndoes not make this explicit, it is plain that if every form is\nnumerically distinct from the form of which it is the intentional\nobject, then (thanks to Self-Predication and Non-Identity) an infinite\nregress of forms beckons (see Rickless (2007, 75\u201379), and also\nGill (1996, 40) and Sayre (1996, 84)). Again, there is nothing to\nsuggest that Plato finds the existence of an infinite regress\nproblematic in itself. Rather, the existence of a regress threatens\nUniqueness, and, when combined in the appropriate way with Purity-F,\nthreatens Oneness. The reasoning that leads to conflict with Oneness\nis parallel to the relevantly similar portion of the Third Man\nargument (see section 4.3 above, and Rickless (2007, 79\u201380) for\ndetails).\n\n\nAs if this weren\u2019t bad enough, Parmenides goes on to derive a\nfurther absurdity from the result of combining the proposal that forms\nare thoughts with the Pie Model conception of partaking. Assuming\nthat thoughts do not have parts, the only way for an object to partake\nof a thought in accordance with the Pie Model is for the object to get\nthe thought as a whole. So if forms are thoughts, then according\nto the Pie Model everything is composed of thoughts, and hence all\nthings think. But, Parmenides assumes, this panpsychist thesis is\nabsurd. Parmenides considers a way of avoiding this absurdity\nthat depends on assuming that something\u2019s having a thought as a\npart does not entail that it is a thinking thing. But, argues\nParmenides, the only way to make sense of this proposal is to assume\nthat thoughts are unthinking, an assumption that is also absurd in\nitself.\n4.5 The Likeness Regress 132c\u2013133a\n\n\nAt the conclusion of Parmenides\u2019 criticism of Socrates\u2019\nsuggestion that forms might be thoughts, Socrates tries a completely\ndifferent tack: he suggests that forms are patterns set in nature\n(paradeigmata) and that partaking of a form amounts to being\nlike it (call the combination of these claims\n\u201cParadigmatism\u201d). Paradigmatism is incompatible both\nwith the proposal that forms are thoughts and with the Pie Model\nconception of partaking. The idea that forms are patterns that\nserve as models for their participants is not new, for it appears in\nvarious places in the dialogues of Plato\u2019s middle period (see\nRepublic 472b7\u2013c7, 510a ff., 597a4\u20135,\n596b6\u20138\u2014and also\nTimaeus 29c1\u20132, 48e5\u201349a1, 50c4\u20136).\n\n\nMost commentators agree that Parmenides\u2019 criticism of\nSocrates\u2019 Paradigmatism depends (at least in part) on the\nconstruction of an infinite regress. But scholars are divided\nover the identity and structure of the regress: whereas some see the\nreasoning as basically indistinguishable from the Third Man argument (e.g.,\nOwen (1953), Vlastos (1954), Cherniss (1957), Hathaway (1973), Lee\n(1973), Teloh (1981, 166), Spellman (1983), Prior (1985, 71\u201375), and\nFine (1993, 211\u2013215)), others see the reasoning as generating a regress\nof forms of likeness (e.g., McCabe (1994, 87\u201389), Schofield (1996),\nAllen (1997, 179\u2013186), and Rickless (2007, 80\u201385)). (The main\ntextual and thematic reasons for preferring the latter reading to the\nformer are clearly described in Schofield (1996)\u2014see also Gill\n(1996, 44\u201345). For a rejoinder to Schofield, see Scolnicov (2003,\n67\u201368).)\n\n\nOn the first view, the regress arises as follows. Consider a plurality\nof F things, A, B, and C. By\nOne-over-Many, each of A,\nB, C is F by virtue of partaking of a form\nof F-ness (say, F1).  By\nSelf-Predication, F1\nis F. Hence A, B, C\nand F1 are all F, and each is like the others in\nbeing F. Now consider the new plurality of F\nthings, A, B, C, and F1. By\nOne-over-Many, each of\nA, B, C, and F1 is F by\nvirtue of partaking of a form of F-ness (say,\nF2). By Non-Identity, F2 is numerically distinct\nfrom F1.  By Self-Predication, F2\nis F. Hence A, B, C, F1,\nand F2 are all\nF, and each is like the others in being F. Now\nconsider the new plurality of F\nthings, A, B, C, F1,\nand F2. By One-over-Many, each\nof A, B, C, F1, and F2\nis F by virtue of partaking of a form of\nF-ness (say, F3). By Non-Identity, F3 is\nnumerically distinct from both F1 and F2. We\ntherefore have three distinct forms of\nF-ness. Repetition of the same pattern of reasoning then\nestablishes the existence of an infinite regress of forms of\nF-ness. This reasoning is homologous to the Third Man argument\ninasmuch as both arguments rely in the very same way on One-over-Many,\nSelf-Predication, and Non-Identity.\n\n\nOn the second view, the regress arises differently. In particular, the\nreasoning relies explicitly on Paradigmatism and on an assumption that\nParmenides emphasizes as he is setting up his criticism, namely that\nthe relation of likeness is symmetrical: if X is\nlike Y, then Y is like X\n(Parmenides 132d5\u20137). Consider two things, A\nand B, that both have the property of being F.\nGiven that there is a property that A and B both\nshare, it follows that\nA is like B and that B is\nlike A. Thus, A is like something (and hence, in\nsome way, like) and B is like something (and hence, in some\nway, like). But, by One-over-Many, A and B are both\nlike by virtue of partaking of a form of likeness\n(say, L1). Now assume for reductio that something is\nlike L1 or L1 is like something. Clearly\nif L1 is like something, then L1 is (in some way)\nlike. And if something is like L1, then, by symmetry of\nlikeness, L1 is like it, and hence again L1 is (in\nsome way) like. So, whether something is like L1\nor L1 is like something,\nL1 is like. Now, by One-over-Many, L1 is like by\nvirtue of partaking of a form of likeness (say, L2), and\nhence L1 partakes of\nL2. By Non-Identity, L2 is numerically distinct\nfrom L1.  But also, by Paradigmatism, L1 is\nlike L2, and hence, by symmetry of likeness, L2 is\nlike L1. So L2 is (in some way) like. By\nOne-over-Many, then, L1 and L2 are like by virtue of\npartaking of a form of likeness (say, L3), and\nhence L1 and L2 both partake of\nL3. By Non-Identity, L3 is numerically distinct from\nboth L1 and\nL2. This gives us three distinct forms of likeness.\nRepetition of the same pattern of reasoning then establishes the\nexistence of an infinite regress of forms of likeness. Taking for\ngranted that the existence of such a regress is in some way absurd or\nproblematic, Parmenides infers that the assumption for\nreductio is false, i.e., that nothing is like L1\nand L1 is like nothing. But this result is itself\nunacceptable. For we already have it that A and B\nare like by virtue of partaking of L1, and hence\nthat A and B partake of L1. By\nParadigmatism, A and B are like L1, and\nhence something is like L1. Moreover, by symmetry of\nlikeness, L1 is like A and B, and\nhence L1 is like something. Thus the assumption\nfor reductio is true. Contradiction. Notice that, on the\nsecond view, the reasoning leading to the relevant regress\nis not homologous to the Third Man argument: instead of\nderiving the claim that each form of likeness is like from\nSelf-Predication, Parmenides infers it from the conjunction of\nParadigmatism and the symmetry of likeness.\n\n\nOn either interpretation of the identity and structure of the relevant\nregress, it is as yet unclear why Parmenides finds the regress\nproblematic. It is reasonable to assume that Parmenides\u2019\nreason for finding the likeness regress problematic is the same as his\nreason for finding the largeness regress problematic in the Third Man\nargument. The same three options canvassed in section 4.3 are\navailable. Some contend that the regress is epistemic and vicious\nby its very nature, others that the regress conflicts with Uniqueness,\nand yet others that the regress leads to the claim that each form in\nthe relevant infinite hierarchy is many, and hence, by Oneness and\nPurity-F, both one and not one.\n4.6 The Greatest Difficulty 133a\u2013134e\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the Likeness Regress, Parmenides raises what he\ncharacterizes as the greatest difficulty for the theory of forms.\nThis difficulty takes the form of two arguments, the first designed to\nshow that, if the forms are as Socrates has described them, they cannot\nbe known by human beings, the second designed to show that, if the\nforms are as Socrates has described them, then the gods cannot know\nhuman affairs. Both of these conclusions, if true, would be\ndevastating to the theory of forms. For, first, in the middle\ndialogues, Plato takes for granted that humans can know at least some\nforms (see Meno 76a6\u20137 and Phaedo 74b2\u20133) and\nsketches a method (i.e., dialectic) that is designed to provide humans\nwith knowledge of the forms (Republic 534b3\u2013c5); and, second,\nas Socrates himself accepts, it would be \u201cshocking\u201d (134c4)\nand \u201castonishing\u201d (134d8) to be told that the gods cannot\nknow human affairs.\n\n\nCommentators differ over the proper way to reconstruct and evaluate the\ntwo arguments. With respect to the first argument, some scholars\n(such as Lewis (1979)) claim that the argument is invalid, some (such\nas Peterson (1981)) that there are two different valid ways of\nreconstructing it, others (such as Yi and Bae (1998), and Rickless\n(2007, 86\u201390)) that there is a single way to reconstruct the argument,\none on which it comes out valid. The second argument is usually\nthought to be largely homologous to the first.\n\n\nThe first argument begins with the assumption (call it P1) that nothing\nthat is itself by itself is in (or among) humans (Parmenides\n133c3\u20136). This assumption reflects a particular understanding of\nwhat Separation requires, a conception that is emphasized in the\ndialogues of the middle period (see Symposium 211a8\u2013b1 and\nTimaeus 52a1\u20133\u2014for discussion, see Rickless (2007,\n19\u201320)). Parmenides then adds, and provides instances of, two\nfurther premises, P2 and P3:\n\n\n\n(P2) If X is a form and X is what it is\nin relation to Y, then Y is a form.\n\n\n(P3) If X is in humans and X is what it\nis in relation to Y, then Y is in humans.\n\n\n\nFor many commentators, P2 states that forms are related to other\nforms, but not to sensible things, and P3 states that sensible things\nare related to other sensible things, but not to forms (see, e.g.,\nRyle (1939), Cherniss (1944, 282 ff.), Chen (1944), Runciman (1959),\nSchipper (1965, 15), Matthews (1972), Weingartner (1973,\n185\u2013187), Fujisawa (1974, 30 ff.), Shiner (1974, 24 and 31),\nMcCabe (1994, 90\u201394), Gill (1996, 45\u201348), Sayre (1996,\n88\u201391), and Allen (1997, 193\u2013203)). But there are good\nreasons for thinking that this interpretation is incorrect (see\nForrester (1974), Lewis (1979), Peterson (1981), Yi and Bae (1998),\nand Rickless (2007, 88)).  Plato\u2019s formulation of P2 and P3\npresupposes a distinction between two ways of being: relative being\nand absolute being.  Something has relative being if it is impossible\nto describe its nature without mentioning something else to which it\nis related.  Something has absolute being if it does not have relative\nbeing.  The point of P2 is that it is in relation to another form that\nany form with merely relative being is defined. The point of P3 is\nthat it is in relation to another sensible thing that any sensible\nthing with merely relative being is defined. This reading is confirmed\nby Parmenides\u2019 illustrations of P2 and P3. Mastery itself, he\nsays, is what it is in relation to slavery itself, but it is not the\ncase that mastery itself is what it is in relation to a human\nslave. Similarly, slavery itself is what it is in relation to mastery\nitself, but it is not the case that slavery itself is what it is in\nrelation to a human master. Moreover, a human master is what he is in\nrelation to a human slave, but it is not the case that a human master\nis what he is in relation to slavery itself.  Similarly, a human slave\nis what he is in relation to a human master, but it is not the case\nthat a human slave is what he is in relation to mastery\nitself. Parmenides then instantiates P3 using the example of\nknowledge:\n\n\n(P3K) If X is knowledge in humans and X is what it is in\nrelation to Y, then Y is in humans.\n\n\nAnd finally, Parmenides assumes that knowledge has merely relative\nbeing:\n\n\n(P4) Knowledge is what it is in relation\nto what it is knowledge of.\n\n\nThe reasoning to the first conclusion is straightforward. By P4,\nknowledge is what it is in relation to what it is knowledge of.\nConsequently, by P3K, if X is knowledge in humans, then the\nobject of X (i.e., what X is knowledge of) is in\nhumans. Now, according to Separation, every form is itself by\nitself. But, by P1, nothing that is itself by itself is in\nhumans. Consequently, whatever is in humans is not a form. So\nif X is knowledge in humans, then the object of X is\nnot a form. That is to say, no knowledge in humans (i.e., no knowledge\nthat humans have) has any form as its object.  Thus, from Separation,\nP1, P3K, and P4, it follows that humans do not know any forms.\n\n\nThe second argument begins with two assumptions: (i) that any knowledge\nthat is a form is more precise than any knowledge that is in humans,\nand (ii) that the gods have any knowledge that is more precise than any\nknowledge that is in humans. From these two assumptions, what\nfollows is:\n\n\n(P5) If X is a knowledge and X is a form,\nthen the gods have X.\n\n\nParmenides then reasons as follows. By P2, if X is a form and\nX is what it is in relation to Y, then Y is\na form. By P4, knowledge is what it is in relation to what it is\nknowledge of.  So P2 and P4 together entail P6:\n\n\n(P6) If X is a form and X is a knowledge\nof Y, then Y is a form.\n\n\nNow, by P1, anything that is itself by itself is not in humans, and,\nby Separation, every form is itself by itself. Hence P1 and\nSeparation entail that no form is in humans, i.e., that if Y is a form,\nthen Y is not in humans. This result, taken together with P6,\nentails P7:\n\n\n(P7) If X is a form and X is a knowledge\nof Y, then Y is not in humans.\n\n\nParmenides then infers the following conclusion from the conjunction\nof P5 and P7:\n\n\n(C) If X is a knowledge of Y\nand the gods have X, then Y is not in humans.\n\n\nIf this inference were valid, then Parmenides would have shown that\nthe object of any knowledge the gods have is not in humans, i.e., that\nthe gods do not know human affairs. However, C does not follow\nvalidly from the conjunction of P7 and P5. Rather C follows\nvalidly from the conjunction of P7 and P5* (for details, see Rickless\n(2007, 92)):\n\n\n(P5*) If X is a knowledge and the gods have X, then X\nis a form.\n\n\nThere are three main possibilities here: (i) Plato simply missed the\nfact that the second argument is invalid; (ii) Plato intended his\nreaders to recognize the argument as invalid; and (ii) Plato\nunintentionally misstated P5* as P5. (In any event, it is\ninteresting to note that, whereas P3 but not P2 functions as a premise\nin the first argument, P2 but not P3 functions as a premise in the\nsecond argument.)\n5. How to Save the Forms: The Plan of the Deductions 134e\u2013137c\n\n\nAfter having articulated potentially devastating criticisms of the\ntheory of forms, one might expect Parmenides to conclude that the\ntheory is a lost cause and should be abandoned. But,\nsurprisingly, Parmenides does exactly the opposite. He claims,\nrather, that one who does not \u201callow that for each thing there is\na character that is always the same\u201d (a clear reference to\nOne-over-Many) will \u201cdestroy the power of dialectic\nentirely\u201d (135b8\u2013c2). Here Parmenides means one of two\nthings, depending on whether \u201cdialectic\u201d is taken in a\ntechnical sense (as meaning the process by which a philosopher is\nsupposed to acquire knowledge of the forms\u2014see Republic\n534b3\u2013c5) or in a non-technical sense (as meaning the ability to\nconverse or communicate).\n\n\nIn any event, Parmenides makes it clear that the power of dialectic\n(however this is understood) cannot be saved unless the forms\nthemselves are saved. As a means of saving the forms, Parmenides\nrecommends a process of training that focuses on forms and takes note\nof the fact that forms wander (in the sense of having contrary\nproperties, such as being like and unlike: 135e1\u20137). In\nparticular, Parmenides suggests that the training process take the\nfollowing shape. First, concerning some form, it must involve\nextracting consequences from the hypothesis that that form is; second,\nconcerning the very same form, it must involve extracting consequences\nfrom the hypothesis that that form is not (135e8\u2013136a2).\nParmenides goes on to say that it is also important to consider\ndifferent sorts of consequences: first, consequences for the form that\nis hypothesized to be (or to not be), and second, consequences for\nthings other than the form that is hypothesized to be (or not to\nbe). Parmenides also says that the training process should\ninvolve extracting consequences for the relevant form in relation to\nitself and in relation to the others, and consequences for things other\nthan the relevant form in relation to themselves and in relation to the\nrelevant form.\n As most commentators agree, the arguments that occupy the second\npart of the dialogue may be grouped into eight distinct stretches of\nreasoning or Deductions, with an additional Appendix to the first two\nDeductions: 155e4\u2013157b5. (Most Neoplatonists take there to be\nnine Deductions.  Rangos (2014), building on remarks in Grote (1865)\nand a seminar of Heidegger from 1930\u201331, argues that the Appendix is\nnot merely a ninth Deduction, but also plays a special role in the\noverall scheme of Deductions.) There is some controversy over the\nprinciples of division that Plato uses to generate the groupings.\nSome, notably Meinwald (1991; 2014), Peterson (1996; 2000; 2003), and\nSayre (1996), argue that the division into eight Deductions should be\nexplained by the three principles of division announced by Parmenides\nin his description of the method of training. On this (non-standard)\npicture, the Deductions should be understood as aiming at the\nfollowing conclusions (where \u2018con-F\u2019 refers to the\nproperty contrary to the property of being F):\n\n\n(D1)\nIf the G is, then the G is not F and\nnot con-F in relation to itself.\n\n(D2)\nIf the G is, then the G is F and\ncon-F in relation to the others.\n(D3)\nIf the G is, then the others are F and\ncon-F in relation to the G.\n(D4)\nIf the G is, then the others are not F and not\ncon-F in relation to themselves.\n(D5)If the G is not, then\nthe G is F and con-F in relation to the\nothers.\n(D6)If the G is not, then\nthe G is not F and not con-F in relation to\nitself.\n(D7)If the G is not, then the\nothers are F and con-F in relation to\nthe G.\n(D8)\nIf the G is not, then the others are not F and\nnot con-F in relation to themselves.\n\n\n\n\nOthers, including Miller (1986), Gill (1996; 2014), Allen (1997), and\nRickless (2007), do not agree with this way of representing the proper\nway of generating eight Deductions. In particular, these scholars take\nissue with the claim that the third principle of division concerns\nwhether the consequences for the relevant form (or for things other\nthan the form) are relative to itself or relative to\nthings other than it. As they see it, the third principle of\ndivision concerns whether the consequences for the relevant form (or\nfor things other than the form) are positive or\nnegative. According to this standard picture, the Deductions\nshould be understood as aiming at the following conclusions:\n\n\n(D1)\nIf the G is, then the G is not F and\nnot con-F (in relation to itself and in relation to the\nothers).\n(D2)\nIf the G is, then the G is F and\ncon-F (in relation to itself and in relation to the\nothers).\n(D3)\nIf the G is, then the others are F and\ncon-F (in relation to themselves and in relation to the\nG).\n(D4)\nIf the G is, then the others are not F and not\ncon-F (in relation to themselves and in relation to the\nG).\n(D5)\nIf the G is not, then the G is F and\ncon-F (in relation to itself and in relation to the\nothers).\n(D6)\nIf the G is not, then the G is not F\nand not con-F (in relation to itself and in relation to the\nothers).\n(D7)\nIf the G is not, then the others are F and\ncon-F (in relation to themselves and in relation to the\nG).\n(D8) If the\nG is not, then the others are not F and not\ncon-F (in relation to themselves and in relation to the\nG). \n\n\n\n(D7 represents something of an anomaly here, because many of the\nconclusions actually derived in that Deduction are of the form: If the\nG is not, then the others appear to be F\nand con-F. See section 6.8 below.) Parmenides then offers to\nengage in the training exercise himself, taking \u201cone\u201d as\nthe relevant instance of \u201cG\u201d, and considering a\nrange of properties as instances of \u201cF\u201d (being\nmany, being a whole, being limited, having shape, being in oneself,\nbeing in another, being in motion, being the same as oneself, being\nthe same as another, being like oneself, being like another, touching\noneself, touching another, being equal to oneself, being equal to\nanother, being (or coming to be) older than oneself, being (or coming\nto be) older than another, being in time, being, being named or spoken\nof, and being the object of an account, opinion, knowledge, or\nperception).\n\n\nOne of the primary motivations for adopting the non-standard picture\nis that the standard picture makes it difficult to understand the\nsecond part of the dialogue as anything other than incoherent.  The\nproblem is this. On the standard picture, D1 and D2 together appear to\nentail that if the one is, then the one is F and is\nnot F (and the one is con-F and is not\ncon-F), and hence that it is not the case that the one\nis. Similarly, D3 and D4 together appear to entail that if the one is,\nthen the others are F and not F (and the others are\ncon-F and not con-F), and hence again that it is not\nthe case that the one is. On the other hand, according to the same\npicture, D5 and D6 together appear to entail that if the one is not,\nthen the one is F and is not F (and the one is\ncon-F and is not con-F), and hence that it is not\nthe case that the one is not. And similarly, D7 and D8 appear to\nentail that if the one is not, then the others are (or at least appear\nto be) F and not F (and the others are, or at least\nappear to be, con-F and not con-F), and hence again\nthat it is not the case that the one is not. Putting all eight\nDeductions together, the overall result on the standard picture is a\nstraightforward contradiction. One advantage of the non-standard\ninterpretation, then, is that it avoids reading the Deductions as an\nextended argument for a necessary falsehood.\n\n\nHowever, there are also good textual reasons to think that the\nstandard picture is superior to the non-standard proposal. For\nexample, in D2, Parmenides argues that if the one is, then the one is\nboth different and the same in relation to itself (147b7\u20138),\nboth like and unlike in relation to itself (148d3\u20134), and both\nolder and younger in relation to itself (152e2\u20133). But according\nto the non-standard picture Parmenides should not be using D2 to argue\nfor consequences about the one in relation to itself; rather,\nParmenides should be using D2 to argue for consequences about the one\nin relation to the others. (In reply to this sort of\ncriticism, Meinwald (1991, 46\u201375; 2014) and Sayre (1996, 114)\nargue, though in different ways, that Plato uses the\nin-relation-to qualifications in a technical, rather than\nordinary, sense. For criticisms of Meinwald\u2019s influential proposal,\nsee Gill (1996, 56, fn. 90; 2014), Sayre (1996, 110\u2013113), and\nRickless (2007, 102\u2013106).)\n\n\nAnother way out of the problem posed by the seeming incoherence of the\nDeductions is to suppose that the subject of one Deduction is\nnumerically distinct from the subject of some of the other\nDeductions. Multisubjectist interpretations of this kind have\nbeen defended by the Neoplatonists (including Plotinus and Proclus),\nCornford (1939), Miller (1986), and Sayre (1996). One of the\nmajor problems facing multisubjectism is the fact that Parmenides is\nquite explicit about the fact that the subject form of each Deduction\nis identical to the subject form of each of the other Deductions.\n(For further criticisms of multisubjectism, see Meinwald (1991,\n24\u201326). For particular criticisms of the Neoplatonist version of\nmultisubjectism, see Allen (1997, 211\u2013215 and 218\u2013224).)\n\n\nThe standard view (if there is one) is that the Deductions have an\naporetic purpose: their aim is to perplex, to set problems that must\nbe solved, either by rejecting some of the premises that lead to the\nmaster contradiction or by finding fault with the relevant\nreasoning. Aporetic interpretations of this sort have been defended by\nSchofield (1977), Gill (1996; 2012) and Allen (1997), with additional\nsupport provided by Patterson (1999). On this kind of view, Plato does\nnot commit to any particular way of solving the problems: the second\npart of the dialogue is simply meant to serve as a challenge to the\nreader.\n\n\nYet another alternative is that detailed logical analysis of the\nDeductions reveals arguments sufficient to establish both that the one\nis and, importantly, that principles such as Purity-F and Uniqueness\nare false. As Rickless (2007, 136\u2013137 and 211) argues, Purity-F\nis a background premise of both D1 and D4. Taken together, then, D1\nand D2 are sufficient to establish that a contradiction follows from\nthe hypothesis that the one is, on the assumption that Purity-F is\ntrue. That is, D1 and D2 together entail that if the one is, then\nPurity-F is false. But D5 and D6 together entail that the one is. It\nthen follows directly that Purity-F must be false. (Gill (2014) argues\nthat the result of D1 and D8, taken together, is that the one must be\nacknowledged to be both one and many.  She also thinks that Plato\nmeans for his readers to recognize that the same acknowledgment is\nneeded to overcome the problematic results of D4.) Moreover, D2\ncontains an argument for the claim that if the one is, then there are\ninfinitely many forms of oneness.  Given that the one is (thanks to D5\nand D6), it follows directly that there must be more than one form\ncorresponding to the property of being one, and hence that Uniqueness\nis false. (Rickless (2007, 238\u2013239) also argues that the second\npart of the dialogue provides sufficient reason to reject No Causation\nby Contraries.)\n6. The Deductions 137c\u2013166c\n\n\nEach Deduction consists of separate stretches of reasoning (call\nthem \u201cArguments\u201d) leading to a number of logically\ninterconnected results (call them \u201cConclusions\u201d). The\nsummary to follow is governed by the following notational\nconventions. Each Deduction receives a number (\u201cD1\u201d\nfor the first Deduction, \u201cD2\u201d for the second Deduction, and\nso on) and each Argument within each Deduction receives a number\n(\u201cA1\u201d for the first Argument, \u201cA2\u201d for the\nsecond Argument, and so on). (The Appendix to the first two\nDeductions will be called \u201cApp\u201d.) If an Argument has\nexactly one Conclusion, the single Conclusion will be referred to as\n\u201cC\u201d. If an Argument has more than one Conclusion, the\nConclusions will be numbered (\u201cC1\u201d for the first\nConclusion, \u201cC2\u201d for the second Conclusion, and so\non).\n6.1 The First Deduction 137c\u2013142a\n\n\nThe aim of D1 is to establish, for a variety of different properties\nF, that if the one is, then the one is neither F nor con-F.\nWithin D1, there are eighteen separate Arguments with the following\nConclusions: If the one is, then the one is not many (D1A1C), the one\nhas no parts (D1A2C1), the one is not a whole (D1A2C2), the one has no\nbeginning, middle, or end (D1A3C), the one is unlimited (D1A4C), the\none has no shape (D1A5C), the one is not in another (D1A6C1), the one\nis not in itself (D1A6C2), the one is nowhere (D1A6C3), the one is not\nin motion (D1A7C), the one is not at rest (D1A8C), the one is not\ndifferent from itself (D1A9C1), the one is not the same as another\n(D1A9C2), the one is not different from another (D1A10C), the one is\nnot the same as itself (D1A11C), the one is not like another or itself\n(D1A12C), the one is not unlike itself or another (D1A13C), the one is\nnot equal to itself or another (D1A14C1), the one is not unequal to\nitself or another (D1A14C2), the one is not the same age as itself or\nanother (D1A15C1), the one is neither younger nor older than itself or\nanother (D1A15C2), the one is not in time (D1A16C), the one neither\ncomes to be nor ceases to be (D1A17C1), the one does not partake of\nbeing (D1A17C2), the one is not (D1A17C3), the one is not one\n(D1A17C4), the one is not named or spoken of, nor is it the object of\nan account, knowledge, perception, or opinion (D1A18C).\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D1 are logically\ninterconnected. The exceptions are D1A1C, D1A9C1, D1A9C2, D1A10C,\nand D1A11C, which do not depend on any previously established\nConclusions. (For details, see Rickless (2007, 112\u2013137).)\n\n\nThe Arguments of D1 also rest on a large number of independent\npremises, among which we find the following: (i) the property of being\none and the property of being many are contraries; (ii) anything that\nhas parts is many; (iii) a whole is a thing with parts from which no\npart is missing; (iv) the beginning, middle, and end of X are\nparts of\nX; (v) the beginning and end of X are the limits\nof X; (vi) to be round is to have extremities that are\nequidistant in every direction from the middle; (vii) to be straight\nis to have a middle that stands in the way of the two extremities;\n(viii) anything that has shape must be either round or straight; (ix)\nif X is in Y, then X is contained all\naround by\nY and X touches Y in many places with many\nparts; (x) if X is contained all around by Y\nand X touches Y in many places with many parts,\nthen X is round; (xi) if X touches Y in\nmany places with many parts, then X has parts; (xii)\nif X both contains itself and is contained by itself,\nthen X is two; (xiii) if X is two, then X\nis many; (xiv) whatever is neither in itself nor in another is\nnowhere; (xv) if X is in motion, then X alters from\nitself or moves spatially; (xvi) if X moves spatially,\nthen X either spins in a circle in the same location or\nchanges from one place to another.\n\n\nIt appears that every Argument of D1 other than D1A9 is logically\nvalid. (However, see Gill (1996, 81, n. 134), who contends that\nD1A12 and D1A13 are fallacious.)) D1A9 seems to commit the\nfallacy of equivocation (see Rickless (2007, 121\u2013123). It also\nappears that almost all the independent premises of D1 are, at least\nfrom Plato\u2019s point of view, either definitionally true or\nself-evident. There are three exceptions to this claim. D1A10\ndepends on the questionable premise that if X is not different by\nitself, then X itself is not different in any way (see Rickless (2007,\n123\u2013124)), and D1A11 depends on the questionable premise that\nif the nature of the F is not identical to the\nnature of the\nG, then if X is G relative to\nitself, X is not F relative to itself (see Rickless\n(2007, 124\u2013126)).\n\n\nBut the most interesting exception is D1A1. In D1A1,\nParmenides argues for D1A1C: that if the one is, then the one is not\nmany. The reasoning is simple. From Oneness or\nSelf-Predication, it follows that the one is one. Consequently,\nif the one is, then the one is one. But the property of being one\nand the property of being many are contraries, and, by Purity-F, no\nform can have contrary properties. Given that the one is a form,\nit follows that if the one is, then the one is not many. The\nnon-obvious premises here are Oneness (or Self-Predication) and\nPurity-F. Whereas some might argue that D1A1 is unsound because\nOneness (or Self-Predication) is false, others might argue that the\nvery point of D1A1 is to show that if the one is and is many, then\nPurity-F is false.\n6.2 The Second Deduction 142b\u2013155e\n\n\nThe aim of D2 is to establish, for a variety of different properties\nF, that if the one is, then the one is both F and\ncon-F. Within D2 there are thirty-three separate Arguments\nwith the following Conclusions: If the one is, then the one partakes\nof being (D2A1C1), the one is not the same as being (D2A1C2), the one\nis a whole (D2A2C1), being and the one are parts of the one (D2A2C2),\nthe one is infinitely many (D2A3C and D2A5C), the different is not the\nsame as the one (D2A4C1), the different is not the same as being\n(D2A4C2), the one has parts (D2A6C1), the one is a whole (D2A6C2), the\none is limited (D2A6C3), the one is unlimited (D2A6C4), the one has a\nbeginning, a middle, and an end (D2A7C1), the one has shape (D2A7C2),\nthe one is in itself (D2A8C1), the one is not nowhere (D2A8C2), the\none is in another (D2A8C3), the one is at rest (D2A9C1), the one is in\nmotion (D2A9C2), the one is the same as itself (D2A10C1), the one is\ndifferent from itself (D2A10C2), the one is different from the others\n(D2A11C), the one is the same as the others (D2A12C), the one is like\nthe others (D2A13C and D2A15C1), the one is unlike the others (D2A14C\nand D2A15C2), the one is like itself (D2A16C1), the one is unlike\nitself (D2A16C2), the one touches itself (D2A17C1), the one touches\nthe others (D2A17C2), the one does not touch itself (D2A18C), the one\ndoes not touch the others (D2A19C), the one is equal to itself\n(D2A20C1), the one is equal to the others (D2A20C2), the one is both\ngreater than and less than itself (D2A21C1), the one is unequal to\nitself (D2A21C2), the one is both greater than and less than the\nothers (D2A22C1), the one is unequal to the others (D2A22C2), the one\nis more than, less than, and equal to itself in number (D2A23C1), the\none is more than, less than, and equal to the others in number\n(D2A23C2), the one partakes of time (D2A24C), the one comes to be\nolder than itself (D2A25C1), the one comes to be younger than itself\n(D2A25C2), the one always is older than itself (D2A26C1), the one\nalways is younger than itself (D2A26C2), the one is the same age as\nitself (D2A27C1), the one is neither older nor younger than itself\n(D2A27C2), the one neither comes to be older nor comes to be younger\nthan itself (D2A27C3), the one is older than the others (D2A28C), the\none is younger than the others (D2A29C), the one is the same age as\nthe others (D2A30C1), the one is neither older nor younger than the\nothers (D2A30C2), the one neither comes to be older nor comes to be\nyounger than the others (D2A31C), the one comes to be younger than the\nothers (D2A32C1), the one comes to be older than the others (D2A32C2),\nthe one partakes of time past, future, and present (D2A33C1), the one\nis and comes to be, was and was coming to be, and will be and will be\ncoming to be (D2A33C2), and the one could be named and spoken of, as\nwell as be the object of an account, knowledge, perception, and\nopinion (D2A33C3).\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D2 are logically\ninterconnected. The exceptions are D2A1C1, D2A1C2, D2A8C2,\nD2A10C1, D2A12C, D2A18C, D2A19C, D2A20C1, D2A20C2, and D2A24C, which do\nnot depend on any previously established conclusions. (For\ndetails, see Rickless (2007, 138\u2013187).)\n\n\nIt appears that every Argument of D2 is logically valid.\n(However, see Gill (1996, 64, n. 107), who contends that D2A8 and D2A9\nare fallacious, and Patterson (1999, 98\u2013100), who argues that D2A8 is\nfallacious.)) Like the Arguments of D1, the Arguments of D2 rest\non a large number of independent premises, including many of the\nindependent premises of D1. Again, most of these premises are, at\nleast from Plato\u2019s point of view, either definitionally true or\nself-evident. (Gill (1996, 83\u201384) objects to one of the premises\nof D2A14 and Patterson objects to one of the premises of D2A28, but\nRickless (2007, 160 and 175) claims that it is unclear whether Plato\nhimself would have found these premises problematic.) There are\nthree exceptions to this claim: D2A4, D2A12, and D2A14. D2A4\ndepends on Causality and No Causation by Contraries, D2A12 depends on\nNo Causation by Contraries, and D2A14C depends on D2A12C. But\nthere are reasons for thinking that No Causation by Contraries is\nfalse. When combined with Causality, No Causation by Contraries\nentails that, for any property F, the F cannot be con-F. But,\nassuming that the one is, this contradicts D2A3C, namely that\nif the one is, then the one is (infinitely) many. So, if\nCausality is true and the one is, then No Causation by Contraries must\nbe false. This result is important, for the falsity of No\nCausation by Contraries would enable Plato to dispatch at least some of\nParmenides\u2019 earlier criticisms of the theory of forms, notably\nthe first two criticisms of the result of combining the theory of forms\nwith the Piece-of-Pie Model conception of partaking\u2014see the end\nof section 4.2 above.\n\n\nNotice that D1 and D2 together entail that if the one is, then\nPurity-F is false. To see why, consider the following. D1 establishes\nthat if Purity-F is true, then if the one is, then the one is\nneither F nor con-F; and D2 establishes that if the\none is, then the one is both F and con-F. So if both\nD1 and D2 are valid and based on acceptable premises (other than\nPurity-F), then D1 and D2 together establish that if Purity-F is true\nand the one is, then the one has\ncontradictory properties. Given that it is impossible\nfor something to have contradictory properties, it is a direct\nconsequence of the conjunction of D1 and D2 that if the one is, then\nPurity-F is false.\n6.3 The Appendix to the First Two Deductions 155e\u2013157b\n\n\nThe function of the Appendix is to show that the Conclusions of D1 and\nD2 together entail that, for a range of properties F, if the\none is, then there is a moment outside of time (the so-called\n\u201cinstant\u201d) at which the one changes from being F\nto being con-F. Within the Appendix, there are five Arguments\nwith the following Conclusions: If the one is, then there are\ntimes T1 and T2 such that T1 is distinct\nfrom T2 and the one partakes of being at T1 and the\none does not partake of being at T2 (AppA1C), there is a\ndefinite time at which the one comes to be (AppA2C1), there is a\ndefinite time at which the one ceases to be (AppA2C2), there is a time\nat which the one ceases to be many (AppA3C1), there is a time at which\nthe one ceases to be one (AppA3C2), there is a time at which the one\nis combined (AppA3C3), there is a time at which the one is separated\n(AppA3C4), there is a time at which the one is made like (AppA3C5),\nthere is a time at which the one is made unlike (AppA3C6), there is a\ntime at which the one is increased (AppA3C7), there is a time at which\nthe one is decreased (AppA3C8), there is a time at which the one is\nmade equal (AppA3C9), there is something (call it \u201cthe\ninstant\u201d) (i) that is in no time at all and (ii) at which the\none changes both from being in motion to being at rest and from being\nat rest to being in motion and (iii) at which the one is neither at\nrest nor in motion (AppA4C), there is something (call it \u201cthe\ninstant\u201d) (i) that is in no time at all and (ii) at which the\none changes both from not-being to being and from being to not-being\nand (iii) at which the one neither is nor is not (AppA5C1), there is\nsomething (call it \u201cthe instant\u201d) (i) that is in no time\nat all and (ii) at which the one changes both from being one to being\nmany and from being many to being one and (iii) at which the one is\nneither one nor many (AppA5C2), there is something (call it \u201cthe\ninstant\u201d) (i) that is in no time at all and (ii) at which the\none changes both from being like to being unlike and from being unlike\nto being like and (iii) at which the one is neither like nor unlike\n(AppA5C3), and there is something (call it \u201cthe instant\u201d)\n(i) that is in no time at all and (ii) at which the one changes both\nfrom being small to being large and from being large to being small\nand (iii) at which the one is neither large nor small (AppA5C4).\n\n\nAll of the individual Arguments within the Appendix are logically\ninterconnected. (For details, see Rickless (2007, 189\u2013198).)\n\n\nIt appears that every Argument of the Appendix is logically\nvalid. Like the Arguments of D1 and D2, the Arguments of the\nAppendix rest on a number of independent premises, including premises\nof D1 and D2. Again, most of the premises are, at least from\nPlato\u2019s point of view, either definitionally true or\nself-evident. (Gill (1996, 86) objects to one of the premises of\nAppA5. For a rejoinder, see Rickless (2007, 195, n. 2).)\nThere is one major exception to this claim, however. All of the\nArguments of the Appendix other than AppA1 depend for their soundness\non the soundness of AppA1. But AppA1 depends for its soundness on\nthe soundness of D1A17, which itself depends for its soundness on the\ntruth of Purity-F. So if Purity-F were false, then all the\nArguments of the Appendix would be unsound.\n6.4 The Third Deduction 157b\u2013159b\n\n\nThe aim of D3 is to establish, for a variety of different\nproperties F, that if the one is, then the others are\nboth F and con-F. Within D3, there are seven\nArguments with the following Conclusions: If the one is, then the\nothers are not the one (D3A1C), the others have parts (D3A2C1), the\nothers are a whole (D3A2C2 and D3A3C2), the others are one (D3A2C3 and\nD3A3C1), the whole and the part of the others are many (D3A4C), the\nwhole and the part of the others are unlimited in multitude (D3A5C1),\nthe whole and the part of the others are unlimited (D3A5C2), the whole\nand the part of the others are limited (D3A6C), each of the others is\nlike itself (D3A7C1), each of the others is like each of the others\nother than itself (D3A7C2), each of the others is unlike itself\n(D3A7C3), and each of the others is unlike each of the others other\nthan itself (D3A7C4). There is also the promise of a number of\nArguments establishing results of the form: If the one is, then the\nothers are both F and con-F.\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D3 are logically interconnected,\nand connected to Arguments within previous Deductions. The only\nexception is D3A2C1, which does not depend on any previously\nestablished Conclusions. (For details, see Rickless (2007,\n198\u2013206).)\n\n\nIt appears that every argument of D3 is logically valid. Like the\nArguments of D1 and D2, the Arguments of D3 rest on a number of\nindependent premises, including premises of D1 and D2. Again, it\nappears that the premises are, at least from Plato\u2019s point of\nview, either definitionally true or self-evident. Thus it appears\nthat, from Plato\u2019s point of view, D3 establishes, without\nreliance on Purity-F or any other potentially problematic assumption,\nthat if the one is, then the others have a host of contrary\nproperties.\n6.5 The Fourth Deduction 159b\u2013160b\n\n\nThe aim of D4 is to establish, for a variety of different properties\nF, that if the one is, then the others are neither F\nnor con-F.  Within D4, there are four Arguments with the\nfollowing Conclusions: If the one is, then the others are not one\n(D4A1C), the others are not many (D4A2C1), the others are not a whole\n(D4A2C2), the others do not have parts (D4A2C3), the others are not\nlike (D4A3C1), the others are not unlike (D4A3C2), the others are not\nboth like and unlike (D4A3C3), the others are not the same (D4A4C1),\nthe others are not different (D4A4C2), the others are not in motion\n(D4A4C3), the others are not at rest (D4A4C4), the others are not\ncoming to be (D4A4C5), the others are not ceasing to be (D4A4C6), the\nothers are not greater (D4A4C7), the others are not equal (D4A4C8),\nand the others are not less (D4A4C9).\n\n\nAll of the individual Arguments in D4 are logically interconnected, and\nconnected to Arguments within previous Deductions. (For details,\nsee Rickless (2007, 207\u2013211).)\n\n\nIt appears that all of the Arguments in D4 are valid. Like the\nArguments of the first three Deductions, the Arguments of D4 rest on a\nnumber of independent premises, including premises of D1 and D2 (but\nnot D3). Again, it appears that most of the premises are, at\nleast from Plato\u2019s point of view, either definitionally true or\nself-evident. There is one major exception to this claim,\nhowever. All of the Arguments of D4 depend for their soundness on\nthe soundness of D1A2. But D1A2 depends for its soundness on the\nsoundness of D1A1, which itself depends for its soundness on the truth\nof Purity-F.\n\n\nSo we can redescribe the Conclusion of D4 as follows: If Purity-F\nis true, then if the one is, then the others do not have a host\nof contrary properties. This means that D3 and D4 together entail that\nif the one is, then Purity-F is false. For, by D3, if the one is, then\nthe others are both F and con-F. But, by D4, if\nPurity-F is true and the one is, then the others are\nneither F nor con-F. So, if Purity-F is true and the\none is, then the others have a host of contradictory\nproperties. Given that it is impossible for anything to have\ncontradictory properties, it follows directly that if the one is, then\nPurity-F is false.\n6.6 The Fifth Deduction 160b\u2013163b\n\n\nThe aim of D5 is to establish, for a variety of different properties\nF, that if the one is not, then the one is both F and con-F.\nWithin D5, there are twelve Arguments with the following Conclusions:\nIf the one is not, then the one is different from the others (D5A1C1),\nwe have knowledge of the one (D5A1C2), the one is different in kind\nfrom the others (D5A2C), the one partakes of something,\nthat, and this (D5A3C), the one is unlike the others\n(D5A4C1), the others are unlike the one (D5A4C2), the one partakes of\nthe unlike (i.e., has unlikeness) in relation to the others (D5A4C3),\nthe one partakes of the like in relation to itself (D5A5C1), the one is\nlike itself (D5A5C2), the one is unequal to the others (D5A6C1), the\nothers are unequal to the one (D5A6C2), the one partakes of the unequal\nin relation to the others (D5A6C3), the one partakes of the large\n(D5A7C1), the one partakes of the small (D5A7C2), the one partakes of\nthe equal (D5A7C3), the one partakes of being (D5A8C1), the one\npartakes of not-being (D5A8C2), the one is in motion (D5A9C), the one\nis not in motion (D5A10C1), the one is at rest (D5A10C2), the one is\naltered (D5A11C1), the one is not altered (D5A11C2), the one comes to\nbe (D5A12C1), the one ceases to be (D5A12C2), the one does not come to\nbe (D5A12C3), and the one does not cease to be (D5A12C4).\n\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D5 are logically interconnected,\nand connected to Arguments within previous Deductions. The\nexceptions are D5A1C1, D5A1C2, D5A3C, D5A5C1, D5A8C1, D5A8C2, and\nD5A10C1, which do not depend on any previously established\nConclusions. (For details, see Rickless (2007, 212\u2013223).)\n\n\nIt appears that all of the Arguments in D5 are valid. Like the\nArguments of the first four Deductions, the Arguments of D5 rest on a\nnumber of independent premises, including premises of D1, D2, and the\nAppendix (but not D3 or D4). Again, it appears that most of the\npremises are, at least from Plato\u2019s point of view, either\ndefinitionally true or self-evident. Thus it appears that, from\nPlato\u2019s point of view, D5 establishes, without reliance on\nPurity-F or any other potentially problematic assumption, that if the\none is not, then the one has a host of contrary properties. In\nother words, as Plato sees it, D5 establishes that if the one is not,\nthen Purity-F is false.\n\n\nWhen combined with the results of D1 and D2 (or, alternatively, with\nthe results of D3 and D4), this result entails that Purity-F is in fact\nfalse. To see this, recall that D1 and D2 (as well as D3 and D4)\ntogether entail that if the one is, then Purity-F is false. Now,\nby D5, if the one is not, then Purity-F is false. So,\nwhether the one is or is not, Purity-F is false. So\nPurity-F is false.\n6.7 The Sixth Deduction 163b\u2013164b\n\n\nThe aim of D6 is to establish, for a variety of different properties\nF, that if the one is not, then the one is neither F\nnor con-F.  Within D6, there are four Arguments with the\nfollowing Conclusions: If the one is not, then the one in no way is\n(D6A1C1), the one in no way partakes of being (D6A1C2), the one in no\nway comes to be (D6A2C1), the one in no way ceases to be (D6A2C2), the\none is not altered in any way (D6A2C3), the one is not in motion\n(D6A2C4), the one is not at rest (D6A2C5), the one does not partake of\nthe small (D6A3C1), the one does not partake of the large (D6A3C2),\nthe one does not partake of the equal (D6A3C3), the one does not\npartake of the like (D6A3C4), the one does not partake of the\ndifferent (D6A3C5), the others are not like the one (D6A4C1), the\nothers are not unlike the one (D6A4C2), the others are not the same as\nthe one (D6A4C3), the others are not different from the one (D6A4C4),\nnone of the following (namely, of that,\nto that, something, this, of this,\nof another, to another, time past, time future, time\npresent, knowledge, perception, opinion, account, and name) is\napplicable to the one (D6A4C5), and the one is in no state at all\n(D6A4C6).\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D6 are logically interconnected,\nand connected to Arguments within previous Deductions. The\nexceptions are D6A1C1 and D6A4C5, which do not depend on any previously\nestablished Conclusions. (For details, see Rickless (2007,\n223\u2013228).)\n\n\nIt appears that all of the Arguments in D6 are valid. Like the\nArguments of the first five Deductions, the Arguments of D6 rest on a\nnumber of independent premises, including premises of D5 (but not D1,\nD2, D3, D4, or the Appendix). Again, it appears that most of the\npremises are, at least from Plato\u2019s point of view, either\ndefinitionally true or just plain obvious. Thus it appears that,\nfrom Plato\u2019s point of view, D6 establishes, without reliance on\nPurity-F or any other potentially problematic assumption, that if the\none is not, then the one has neither of a host of contrary\nproperties.\n\n\nWhen combined with the results of D5, this result entails that the one\nis. To see this, consider the following. D5 establishes that if the\none is not, then the one is both F and con-F; and D6\nestablishes that if the one is not, then the one is neither F nor\ncon-F. So if both D5 and D6 are valid and based on acceptable\npremises, then D5 and D6 together establish that if the one is not,\nthen the one has contradictory properties. Given that it is\nimpossible for something to have contradictory properties, it\nis a direct consequence of the conjunction of D5 and D6 that it is not\nthe case that the one is not. That is to say, D5 and D6 together\nentail that the one is.\n\n\nThis is a significant result, for two reasons. First, it\nreinforces the earlier result obtained from the conjunction of D1, D2,\nand D5 (and from the conjunction of D3, D4, and D5), namely that\nPurity-F is false. For D1 and D2 (as well as D3 and D4) together\nentail that if the one is, then Purity-F is false. But D6\nestablishes that the one is. It then follows directly by modus\nponens that Purity-F is false. Second, the result that the one is\ncan be generalized to establish the being of any form whatever.\nThe reason is that none of the reasoning in the Deductions up to this\npoint depends on the one\u2019s having been chosen as the main subject\nof the Deductions. Every Argument of D1\u2013D6 would go through if\nsome other form were substituted for the one as the main topic of\ndiscussion. Earlier, Parmenides had said that \u201conly a very\ngifted man can come to know that for each thing there is some kind, a\nbeing itself by itself\u201d (135a\u2013b). So he has now revealed\nhimself to be the \u201cvery gifted man\u201d of whom he had\nspoken.\n6.8 The Seventh Deduction 164b\u2013165e\n\n\nThe aim of D7 is to establish, for a variety of different properties\nF, that if the one is not, then the others are\nboth F and con-F.  Within D7, there are six\nArguments with the following Conclusions: If the one is not, then the\nothers are (D7A1C1), the others are other (D7A1C2), the others are\ndifferent (D7A1C3), the others are other than each other (D7A1C4), the\nothers are infinitely many (D7A2C), each of the others appears to be\none (D7A3C1), each of the others is not one (D7A3C2), the others\nappear to be infinitely many (D7A3C3), some of the others appear to be\neven, others odd (D7A3C4), none of the others is either even or odd\n(D7A3C5), among the others there appears to be a smallest (D7A4C1),\neach of the others (even the other that appears smallest) appears\nlarge in relation to its parts (D7A4C2), each of the others appears to\ncome to the equal (D7A4C3), each of the others appears to have no\nbeginning, middle, or end in relation to itself (D7A5C1), each of the\nothers appears unlimited in relation to itself (D7A5C2), each of the\nothers appears limited in relation to another (D7A5C3), each of the\nothers appears to be like itself and each of the others (D7A6C1), and\neach of the others appears to be unlike itself and each of the others\n(D7A6C2).\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D7 are logically interconnected,\nand connected to Arguments within previous Deductions. The\nexceptions are D7A1C1 and D7A3C5, which do not depend on any previously\nestablished Conclusions. (For details, see Rickless (2007,\n228\u2013236).)\n\n\nIt appears that all of the Arguments in D7 are valid. Like the\nArguments of the first six Deductions, the Arguments of D7 rest on a\nnumber of independent premises, including premises of every Deduction\nother than D4 and the Appendix. Again, it appears that most of\nthe premises are, at least from Plato\u2019s point of view, either\ndefinitionally true or just plain obvious. Thus it appears that,\nfrom Plato\u2019s point of view, D7 establishes, without reliance on\nPurity-F or any other potentially problematic assumption, that if the\none is not, then the others appear to have a host of contrary\nproperties. (Thus D7 does not conform exactly to\nParmenides\u2019 earlier description of the method of the\nDeductions. What we would expect from that description is not\nthat D7 would establish that if the one is not then the others\nappear to have contrary properties, but rather that D7 would\nestablish that if the one is not then the others actually have\ncontrary properties. This discrepancy remains something of a\nmystery.)\n\n\nStill, it is possible to extract an interesting result from D7, when\ncombined with a result from D3. D7A1 establishes that if the one is\nnot, then the others are (D7A1C1). But D3 establishes (for\nmany F\u2019s) that if the one is, then the others\nare F. But to be F is to be in some way or other. So\nif the others are F, then the others are. So D3 establishes\n(for many F\u2019s) that if the one is, then the others are. Thus,\nD3 and D7A1C1 together entail that, whether the one is or is not, the\nothers are. Hence D3 and D7 together entail that the others\nare. Assuming that the others are (or, at least, include) all the\nforms other than the one, it follows, in conjunction with the\npreviously established result that the one is (see section 6.7 above),\nthat every form is. This reinforces the previous claim (see\nsection 6.7 again) that the result that the one is can be generalized\nto all the forms.\n6.9 The Eighth Deduction 165e\u2013166c\n\n\nThe aim of D8 is to establish, for a variety of different properties\nF, that if the one is not, then the others are\nneither F nor con-F. Within D8, there are two\nArguments with the following Conclusions: If the one is not, then none\nof the others is one (D8A1C1), the others are not many (D8A1C2), the\nothers cannot be conceived to be either one or many (D8A2C).\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D8 are logically interconnected,\nand connected to Arguments within previous Deductions. The lone\nexception is D8A2C, which depends on none of the Conclusions\nestablished in previous Deductions. (For details, see Rickless\n(2007, 236\u2013238).)\n\n\nIt appears that all of the Arguments in D8 are valid. Like the\nArguments of the first seven Deductions, the Arguments of D8 rest on a\nnumber of independent premises, including premises of D1. Again,\nit appears that most of the premises are, at least from Plato\u2019s\npoint of view, either definitionally true or just plain obvious.\nThus it appears that, from Plato\u2019s point of view, D8 establishes,\nwithout reliance on Purity-F or any other potentially problematic\nassumption, that if the one is not, then the others are, at the very\nleast, neither one nor many.\n\n\nTaken together, D7 and D8 establish that the one is. For D7A2\nshows that if the one is not, then the others are many. But D8A1\nshows that if the one is not, then the others are not many. Thus\nD7 and D8 show that if the one is not, then the others have\ncontradictory properties. Given that nothing can have\ncontradictory properties, it follows directly that the one is.\nThis reinforces the result previously established in section 6.7.\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nScholars are deeply divided about the central interpretive questions\nrelating to a proper understanding of Plato\u2019s\nParmenides. What is the point of Parmenides\u2019\ncriticisms of Socrates\u2019 theory of forms, taken both individually\nand collectively, in the first part of the dialogue? What is the\npoint of Parmenides\u2019 instantiation of his own recommended method\nof training in the second part of the dialogue? And how, in\nparticular, is the second part of the dialogue supposed to bear on the\nfirst?\n\n\nIt is possible that the dialogue as a whole is a kind of satire (Tabak\n(2015)), but given the logical connections both within and across its\nparts, the satirical hypothesis is unlikely.\n\n\nFor some, Parmenides\u2019 criticisms are no more than a \u201crecord\nof honest perplexity\u201d (see Vlastos (1954, 343); Gill (1996; 2012);\nAllen (1997)). On this view, Plato\u2019s intention was simply\nto put forward difficulties for the theory of forms that he himself did\nnot, at least at the time he wrote the dialogue, see a way to\nresolve. The main problem for this interpretation is that, after\nhaving laid out his criticisms of the theory, Parmenides says that it\nshould be possible for a \u201cvery gifted man\u201d to defend the\nexistence of the forms, and thereby explain the possibility of\ndialectic, through a method of training that Parmenides himself goes on\nto instantiate in the second part of the dialogue.\n\n\nFor others, Parmenides\u2019 criticisms are fallacies that someone who\nfollows Parmenides\u2019 recommended method of training will thereby be in\na position to diagnose. On this view, the theory of forms emerges\nrelatively intact at the end of the dialogue. The most influential\nversion of this view belongs to Meinwald (1991; 1992; 2014) and Peterson\n(1996; 2000; 2003). According to Meinwald, Plato meant us to recognize\nthe invalidity of Parmenides\u2019 criticisms of the theory of forms by\nhaving us focus on the in-relation-to qualifications that are\nsupposed to serve as one of the principles of division that explain\nthe fact that the second part takes the shape of eight separate\nDeductions. These qualifications, properly understood, reveal that\nsubject-predicate sentences (of the form \u201cX\nis F\u201d) are ambiguous: to say that X\nis F is to say\neither that X is F in relation to\nitself (i.e.,\npros heauto) or that X is F in\nrelation to the others (i.e., pros ta alla), where to\nsay that X is F\npros heauto is to say that the F is definitionally\ntrue of X, and to say that X is F pros\nta alla is to say that X displays the feature of\nbeing F. As Meinwald argues, if Plato meant us to recognize\nthe existence of such an ambiguity, then he probably meant us to\nrecognize that self-predicational sentences (of the form \u201cThe\nF is F\u201d) are also ambiguous, and that the\nambiguity of such sentences reveals that the Third Man argument and\nthe Greatest Difficulty commit the fallacy of equivocation. The main\nproblem with this particular interpretive strategy is that it is\nprovably false that all versions of the Third Man argument\n(or Greatest Difficulty) come out fallacious if self-predicational\nsentences are ambiguous as between pros heauto and pros\nta alla readings. (For details, see Frances (1996).)\n\n\nThere are other interpretations that are similar to the one defended by\nMeinwald and Peterson. Miller (1986), for example, argues that a\ndiscerning reader who is able to look beneath the surface of the text\nis in a position to recognize that Parmenides\u2019 criticisms are\neffective only on the wrong-headed supposition that forms are\nfundamentally similar to the sensible, material things that partake of\nthem. The point of the dialogue, on this view, is to help the\ndiscerning reader see the forms for what they really are, transcendent\nbeings that should be accessed by reason rather than with the help of\ncategories drawn from sense experience. One of the problems with\nsuch an interpretation is a problem that is common to esoteric readings\nin general: once one has left the surface of the text, there are no\ninterpretive constraints on what one might find beneath the\nsurface. Virtually any interpretation will turn out to\nbe justified by the text. Another problem with this approach is\nthat it pays insufficient attention to the logical interconnections\namong individual criticisms of the theory of forms, and between the\ncriticisms as a whole and the Deductions.\n\n\nThere is another way of answering the three central interpretive\nquestions, one on which Parmenides\u2019 criticisms as well as the\nDeductions come out as serious and valid. (This is the interpretation\ndefended in Rickless (2007), and one aspect of which is defended,\nthough on different grounds, in Gill (2014).) What Parmenides\u2019\ncriticisms reveal is that, whether combined with the Pie Model\nconception of partaking or with Paradigmatism, Plato\u2019s middle period\ntheory of forms is internally inconsistent. It turns out that there\nare three principles the abandonment of which would eliminate all\ninconsistencies apart from the Greatest Difficulty: Purity-F,\nUniqueness, and No Causation by Contraries. Careful logical analysis\nof the second part of the dialogue then reveals that the Deductions\nestablish not only that the forms posited by the middle period theory\nexist, but also that Purity-F, Uniqueness, and No Causation by\nContraries are all false. It is then reasonable to suppose that Plato\nmeant the reader to recognize that the proper way to save the forms is\nby abandoning these three basic assumptions.  And, importantly, this\ncan be done without abandoning the most important principles at the\nheart of the middle period theory, namely One-over-Many and\nSeparation. The aptly-named Greatest Difficulty is then left as a\nchallenge for future work.\n",
