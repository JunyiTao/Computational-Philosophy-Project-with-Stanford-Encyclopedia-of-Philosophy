Attempts to specify the principles that render an exchange\nfair or unfair can be traced back at least as far as Aristotle, who\nargued that a just exchange will embody a kind of reciprocity such\nthat the values of the goods exchanged are proportional\n(Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, Part V). But while the notion of\nproportionality is intuitively appealing, it is somewhat unclear\nprecisely what Aristotle had in mind by it, or what the most\ndefensible explication of the idea would be. To borrow\nAristotle\u2019s own example, if a shoemaker and a builder trade, how\nmany pairs of shoes is proportional to a single house?\n\nIn the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, we find the beginnings of a\nmuch more sophisticated and promising approach to questions such as\nthis. In his Summa Theologiae, Aquinas sought to answer the\nquestion of \u201cwhether a man may lawfully sell a thing for more\nthan it is worth?\u201d The \u201cworth\u201d of a thing, for\nAquinas, was its just price. And the just price, according to Aquinas,\nappears to have been simply the prevailing market price (Summa\nTheologiae, part 2, second part, question 77; see also de Roover\n1958 and Friedman 1980). Rather than relying on some fixed notion of\nproportionality, Aquinas\u2019 just price will be responsive to\nconsiderations of supply and demand. But not just any price\nthat two individuals mutually agree upon will be deemed just on\nAquinas\u2019 standard. Thus, a seller who takes advantage of fraud,\nor a temporary monopoly, to charge an excessive price for an item\nwould be acting unjustly, insofar as his price is in excess of the\nprice at which similar goods typically sell in the relevant market.\nBut Aquinas saw nothing inherently sinful in selling a good for more\nthan one paid for it, or with charging enough to earn a profit, or to\ncompensate for risks involved in the productive process. Seeking\nprofit for its own sake may involve a certain sort of\n\u201cdebasement\u201d, but profit can also be sought in order to\nfulfill necessary or even virtuous ends.\n\nLater Scholastics would devote considerable attention to developing\nand refining the notion of the just price. Of special concern was the\nprice attached to the lending of money, or interest. Since the\nfounding of the Catholic church, it was widely regarded as sinful for\nlenders to charge interest on their loans, and so-called\n\u201cusury\u201d was prohibited by canon and often by secular law.\nMuch of the concern regarding usury seems to have been driven by the\nidea that the charging of interest involves an inequitable\nexchange\u2014lenders give something to borrowers, but demand back\nmore than they have given. But Aquinas seems to have been particularly\nconcerned that borrowers would often be driven to take out loans out\nof necessity, and thus that their consent to the exchange is not fully\nvoluntary (Summa Theologiae, part 2, second part, question\n78).\n\nThe much later natural law theorist John Locke also took up questions\nregarding just and unjust prices, not in either of his well-known\ntreatises on government but in a lesser known tract titled,\nVenditio. Locke, even more explicitly than Aquinas, saw the\njust price as being equivalent to \u201cthe market price at the place\nwhere he sells\u201d (Locke 1661: 340). The relativity of the just\nprice to the particular market in which the transaction takes place is\nimportant. For Locke argued that if two ships sailed laden with corn,\none to Dunkirk where there is a near famine taking place, and the\nother to Ostend where normal conditions obtain, it would not be unjust\nfor the merchant to sell at a significantly higher price in the former\nlocation than in the latter (so long as the higher price is one that\nthe buyers can afford). If the merchant did not charge a\nhigher price, Locke argued, then two problems would result. First, it\nis likely that the merchant\u2019s goods would simply be bought by\nspeculators and resold on a secondary market, thereby simply\nredirecting the profit into somebody else\u2019s hands without doing\nanything to improve the situation of buyers. And second, if merchants\ncannot charge a high price in \u201cgood\u201d markets to cover\ntheir losses in \u201cbad\u201d ones, they will soon operate at a\nnet loss and this will, Locke claims, \u201cquickly put an end to\nmerchandising\u201d (Locke 1661: 342).\n\nWhat would be unjust would be for the merchant to sell an\nitem to a particular individual for a price higher than the general\nmarket rate as might happen, for instance, if that individual is in\nparticular distress. Thus, Locke holds, if anchors typically sell for\na certain price, say 100 pounds, then it would be unjust\n(exploitative) to charge the captain of a distressed ship 5000 pounds\nfor an anchor, simply because one knows he will be compelled to pay\nit. The just price is the going market rate, where that rate is\ndetermined by the general features of supply and demand, and\nnot the particular needs or vulnerabilities of any particular buyer or\nseller.\n\nInterest in exploitation as a feature of economic exchange is thus\nalmost as old as philosophy itself. It was not until the\n19th century, however, that exploitation as a feature of\nemployment relationships came to be a subject of\nphilosophical and political concern. In a sense, of course, the\nemployment relationship is simply another instance of economic\nexchange, with the laborer selling his or her work in exchange for\nmoney in the form of wages. But two ideas led many people to think\nthat there was something special about labor. The first was a belief\nthat labor is the ultimate source of all economic value. The second\nwas the belief that labor morally entitles the laborer to the full\nvalue of that which he or she has produced.\n\nMore will be said about the first of these ideas in the discussion of\nMarx\u2019s theory of exploitation, below. The second idea, and its\nconnection to the idea of labor exploitation, is perhaps best\nillustrated by the theory put forth by the 19th century\nliberal Thomas Hodgskin. For Hodgskin, as for Locke from whose ideas\nhe drew heavily, the right of private property is a natural,\npre-political right. That right consists in\n\n\nthe right of individuals, to have and to own, for their own separate\nuse and enjoyment, the produce of their own industry, with\npower freely to dispose of the whole of that in the manner most\nagreeable to themselves. (Hodgskin 1832: 24)\n\n\nBut while the natural right of property is based on labor, there is\nalso an artificial right of property that is based on nothing\nmore than legislative force. That artificial right cements in place,\nthrough the machinery of government, property claims that had their\norigins not in labor but in violence, conquest, and theft. And it\nthereby enables capitalists to profit without labor, simply by virtue\nof their (illegitimate) control of the means of production (Reeve\n1987b).\n\nFor Hodgskin, capitalists exploit workers in precisely the same way\nthat landlords exploit their tenants. In both cases, one person is\nentitled to a stream of revenue simply by virtue of their legal claim\nof ownership (Hodgskin 1832: 97). The money the landlord earns as rent\ncomes from the wages the tenant earns as a laborer, just as the money\nthe capitalist earns as profit comes from the sale of products\nproduced by his laborers. In both cases, one person is able to live as\na parasite off the productive activities of others, all because the\nstate actively suppresses the natural right of laborers to the full\nproduct of their labor, in favor of the artificial right of property\nestablished by violence. One finds echos of Hodgskin\u2019s concern\nabout harmful parasitism in contemporary discussions of exploitation\nas well (van Donselaar 2009).\n\nEven before Marx, then, we see in the 19th century a tight\nconnection between theories of exploitation and theories of class and\nof class conflict. Marx himself credited the \u201cbourgeois\neconomists\u201d of the French Industrialist school with\nhaving pioneered the economic analysis of class struggle (Marx &\nEngels 1965: 69). For members of that school, the two great classes\ninto which society was divided were productive laborers and\nunproductive social parasites. The class of productive\nlaborers was understood broadly to encompass not only those who\nexerted physical labor to create tangible goods and services, but\nanyone who worked to make goods more useful than they would otherwise\nbe\u2014so laborers, yes, but also entrepreneurs,\narbitrageurs, and even capitalists in their role as managers\nand overseers of investments. The unproductive classes, in contrast,\nconsisted of those who consume value but do not produce it, such as\nthe army, the government, and the state-supported clergy (Raico 1977:\n395).\n\nAccording to Industrialists such as Charles Comte and Jean-Baptiste\nSay, the unproductive classes are able to maintain themselves by using\nthe coercive power of government to forcibly extract resources from\nthe productive. Taxes and tariffs were the most obvious forms such\n\u201cplunder\u201d could take, but the same goal could also be\nachieved by special protections for favored industries including the\nlimited conferral of monopoly power (Say 1964: 146\u2013147).\n\nFor both Hodgskin and for the Industrialists, then, the state was a\nkey agent in facilitating the exploitation of one class of individuals\nby another, and the most certain way to end exploitation was therefore\nto sharply limit the power of the state and to strengthen the\n\u201cnatural\u201d right of private property. But not all theorists\nof the 19th century saw things this way. For Ricardian\nSocialists such as John Bray, ending exploitation would require\nensuring that all persons have equal access to the means of\nproduction, and thereby guaranteeing a system of equal exchange based\non the labor theory of value (Bray 1839). While Hodgskin and the\nIndustrialists sought to purify capitalism from statist interference,\nBray and his fellow socialists sought to eliminate it altogether.\n",
