    "main_text": "Causation: existence as functioning\n5. Causation: existence as functioning\n\nThe Abhidharma\u2019s ontological investigations occasioned a host of\ndoctrinal problems that became the subject of an ongoing debate among\nthe Buddhist schools. One primary controversy centered on the\nprinciple of impermanence: if all phenomena are impermanent, the\nSautr\u0101ntika challenged the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and the\nTherav\u0101da, then dharmas must be changing continuously\nand can neither exist in the past and future nor endure for any period\nof time, however short, in the present. On the other hand, the\nsystematic analysis of experience in terms of momentary\ndharmas required the Abhidharma to provide a rigorous account\nof the processes that govern psychological and physical continuity.\nWhat fuels these processes is causal interaction, but the very notion\nof causation is allegedly compromised by the theory of momentariness.\nIf causes, conditions, and their results are all momentary events, how\ncan an event that has ended have a result? How can an event that\nundergoes distinct stages of origination, endurance, and cessation in\na brief moment have causal efficacy? Notwithstanding their doctrinal\ndifferences, both the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and the Therav\u0101da\nAbhidhamma had to confront these challenges, and they did so by\nformulating complex theories of immediate contiguity that grant causal\nefficacy.\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da developed an analysis of causal\nconditioning in terms of intricate interrelations among four types of\ncondition (pratyaya) and six types of cause (hetu).\nAs documented in the Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya\n(AKB 2.49) based on canonical texts including the\nVij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya, the\nPrakara\u1e47ap\u0101da, and the\nJ\u00f1\u0101naprasth\u0101na, the four conditions are: 1)\nroot cause (literally \u201ccause as condition,\u201d\nhetupratyaya), reckoned the foremost in inciting the process\nof fruition and origination; 2) immediate antecedent, which holds\nbetween a consciousness moment and its immediately preceding moment in\nthat consciousness series; 3) object support, which applies to all\ndharmas insofar as they are intentional objects of\nconsciousness; and 4) predominance, which facilitates sensory\ndiscriminative awareness, e.g., the faculty of sight\u2019s\npredominance over visual cognitive awareness. The six causes are: 1)\ninstrumentality (k\u0101ra\u1e47ahetu), deemed the primary\nfactor in the production of a result; 2) simultaneity or coexistence,\nwhich connects phenomena that arise simultaneously; 3) homogeneity,\nexplaining the homogenous flow of dharmas that evokes the\nseeming continuity of phenomena; 4) association, which operates only\nbetween mental dharmas and explains why the elements of\nconsciousness always appear as assemblages of mental factors; 5)\ndominance, which forms one\u2019s habitual cognitive and behaviorist\ndispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the result of\nactively wholesome or unwholesome dharmas. The four\nconditions and six causes interact with each other in explaining\nphenomenal experience: for instance, each consciousness moment acts\nboth as the homogenous cause as well as the immediate antecedent\ncondition of the rise of consciousness and its concomitants in a\nsubsequent\n moment.[13]\n\nUnderlying this analysis of causal conditioning is the notion of\nexistence as efficacious action, or karma. Karma, a fundamental\nprinciple in Buddhist thought from its inception, is what fuels the\nrepetitive experience in sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the round of\n rebirth.[14]\n In Abhidharma exegesis, the efficacious action or distinctive\nfunctioning of dharmas is understood predominantly as causal\nfunctioning. For the orthodox\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, the existence of\ndharmas as real entities (dravyatas) is determined\nby both their intrinsic nature and particular causal functioning.\nIntrinsic nature, however, is an atemporal determinant of real\nexistence. What determines a dharma\u2019s spatio-temporal\nexistence is its distinctive causal functioning: past and future\ndharmas have capability (s\u0101marthya) of\nfunctioning, while present dharmas also exert a distinctive\nactivity (k\u0101ritra). Present activity is an internal\ncausal efficacy that assists in the production of an effect within a\ndharma\u2019s own consciousness series. It is this activity\nthat determines a dharma\u2019s present existence and\ndefines the limits of the span of its present moment. Capability, by\ncontrast, is a conditioning efficacy externally directed towards\nanother consciousness series: it constitutes a condition that assists\nanother dharma in the production of its own effect (Cox\n2004A, 570\u2013573; Williams 1981, 240\u2013243). A\ndharma\u2019s present activity arises and falls away, but\npast and future dharmas all have potential for causal\nfunctioning and exist as real entities due to their intrinsic nature.\nFor the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, this model\u2014which insists on\nconstant change within the limits of the present moment and implies\nthe existence of dharmas in the three time\nperiods\u2014preserves both the principle of impermanence yet\nexplains continuity and causal efficacy.\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika distinction between a\ndharma\u2019s activity and capability implies that each\ndharma or consciousness moment effects the next moment within\nits series, but it can also act as a contributory condition towards\nproducing a different sort of effect. Activity engenders the next\nmoment within a dharma\u2019s series, while capability\ngenerates a different effect and explains the causal efficacy of past\ndharmas. Williams (1981, 246\u2013247) helpfully notes that\nwe may render this \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d\ncausality, within a consciousness series and transcending it\nrespectively. For example, an instant of visual awareness horizontally\nproduces the next moment of visual awareness and may or may not,\ndepending on other factors such as light and so on, vertically produce\nvision of the object. \u201cIt follows that to be present is to have\nhorizontal causality, which may or may not include vertical\ncausality\u2014a fact which serves to remind us that we are dealing\nhere with primary existents which are frequently positioned within the\nsystem in terms of what they do\u201d (ibid). Thus activity\nor horizontal causality\u2014a dharma\u2019s function of\nprecipitating the next moment of its own consciousness\nseries\u2014individuates that dharma as a particular event\nof its kind. A dharma\u2019s capability or vertical\ncausality, by which it facilitates the occurrence of other\ndharmas outside its consciousness series, locates it within\nthe web of interrelations that connects it with the incessant rise and\nfall of other dharmas, and hence further individuates it as\nthat very particular dharma by manifesting its unique quality\nand intensity of operation.\n\nThe Satur\u0101ntika and the Therav\u0101da developed alternative\ntheories of causal conditioning in conjunction with their rejection of\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da ontological model and their claim that\ndharmas exist only in the present. The Sautr\u0101ntika\nexplained causal interaction among past and future dharmas by\nreference to the idea of \u201cseeds\u201d (b\u012bja), or\nmodifications in subsequent dharma series. The\nSautr\u0101ntika theory of seeds is the precursor of two extremely\nimportant concepts of later Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist thought,\nnamely, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s concepts of \u201cstore\nconsciousness\u201d (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na) and of\nBuddha-nature (tath\u0101gatagarbha) (Cox 1995, 94\u201395; Gethin\n1998, 222). The Therav\u0101da theory of causal conditioning, as set\nout in the Pa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na, proposes a set of\ntwenty-four conditional relations (paccaya) that account for\nall possible ways in which a phenomenon may function in conditioning\nthe rise of another phenomenon. The twenty-four conditional relations\nare: 1) root cause (hetupaccaya); 2) object support; 3)\npredominance; 4) proximity; 5) contiguity; 6) simultaneity; 7)\nreciprocity; 8) support; 9) decisive support; 10) pre-existence 11)\npost-existence; 12) habitual cultivation; 13) karma; 14) fruition; 15)\nnutriment; 16) controlling faculty; 17) jh\u0101na \u2013 a\nrelation specific to meditation attainments; 18) path \u2013 a\nrelation specific to the stages on the Buddhist path; 19) association;\n20) dissociation; 21) presence; 22) absence; 23) disappearance; 24)\n non-disappearance.[15]\n The majority of the Therav\u0101da twenty-four conditions have\ncounterparts in the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da theory and both systems\nshow various other parallel interests and points of resemblance. The\nlikelihood, then, is that the two systems originated before the two\nschools separated and continued to evolve after their separation\n(Conze 1962, 152\u2013153; Kalupahana 1961, 173).\n\nTheir differences notwithstanding, both the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and\nthe Therav\u0101da theories of causal conditioning are based on the\nnotions that dharmas are psycho-physical events that perform\nspecific functions, and that to define what a dhamma is\nrequires one to determine what it does (Gethin 1992A, 150). It turns\nout, then, that the relative positioning of each dharma\nwithin a network of causes and conditions is, first and foremost, a\nmeans for its individuation. Only in a subsidiary sense is this\nnetwork an analysis of causal efficacy. What reappears here is the\ncategorial dimension of the dharma analysis qua a\nmetaphysical theory of mental events in terms of sameness of\nconditional relations. Analogous to the space-time coordinate system\nthat enables one to identify and describe material objects, the\nnetwork of conditional relations may be seen as a coordinate system\nthat locates within it any given dharma, implying that to be\na dharma is to be an event that has a place in that web of\nrelations\u2014an idea reminiscent of Donald Davidson\u2019s\nprinciple of sameness of causes and effects as a condition of identity\nof events (2001 119\u2013120 & 154\u2013161). Two\ndharma instances of the same type would fit into the web of\ncausal conditions in exactly the same way, but would then be\ndistinguished as individual instances on the grounds of their unique\ndegrees and modes of causal efficacy.\n",
