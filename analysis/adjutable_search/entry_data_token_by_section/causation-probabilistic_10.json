    "main_text": "Probability-raising Theories of Causation || The Common Cause Principle\n2.3 The Common Cause Principle\n\nReichenbach (1956) formulated a principle he dubbed the \u2018Common Cause\nPrinciple\u2019 (CCP). Suppose that events A and B are\npositively correlated, i.e., that\n\n\\(\\PP(A \\amp B) \\gt \\PP(A) \\times \\PP(B)\\).\n\n\nBut suppose that neither A nor B is a cause of the\nother. Then Reichenbach maintained that there will be a common cause,\nC, of A and B, satisfying the following\nconditions:\n\n\\(0 \\lt \\PP(C) \\lt 1\\)\n\\(\\PP(A \\amp B \\mid C) = \\PP(A \\mid C) \\times \\PP(B\n\\mid C)\\)\n\\(\\PP(A \\amp B \\mid {\\nsim}C) = \\PP(A \\mid {\\nsim}C)\n\\times \\PP(B \\mid {\\nsim}C)\\)\n\\(\\PP(A \\mid C) \\gt \\PP(A \\mid {\\nsim}C)\\)\n\\(\\PP(B \\mid C) \\gt \\PP(B \\mid {\\nsim}C)\\).\n\n\nWhen events A, B, and C satisfy these conditions,\nthey are said to form a conjunctive fork. 5 and 6 follow from\nC being a cause of A and a cause of B. Conditions\n2 and 3 stipulate that C and \\({\\nsim}C\\) screen off A\nfrom B.\n\nConditions 2 through 6 mathematically entail 1. Reichenbach says that\nthe common cause explains the correlation between A\nand B. The idea is that probabilistic correlations that are not\nthe result of one event causing another are ultimately derived from\nprobabilistic correlations that do result from a causal\nrelationship.\n\nReichenbach\u2019s definition of causation, discussed in\n Section 2.2\n above, appeals to time order: it requires that a cause occur earlier\nthan its effect. But Reichenbach also thought that the direction from\ncauses to effects can be identified with a pervasive statistical\nasymmetry. Suppose that events A and B are correlated,\nand that C satisfies conditions 2\u20136 above, so that\nABC form a conjunctive fork. If C occurs earlier than\nA and B, and there is no event satisfying 2 through 6\nthat occurs later than A and B, then ACB is said\nto form a conjunctive fork open to the future. Analogously,\nif there is a later event satisfying 2 through 6, but no earlier\nevent, we have a conjunctive fork open to the past. If an\nearlier event C and a later event D both satisfy 2\nthrough 6, then ACBD forms a closed fork.\nReichenbach\u2019s proposal was that the direction from cause to\neffect is the direction in which open forks predominate. In our world,\nthere are a great many forks open to the future, few or none open to\nthe past. However, we shall see in\n section 3.6\n below that conjunctive forks are not the best structures for\nidentifying causal direction. \n",
