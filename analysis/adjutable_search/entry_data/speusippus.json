    "preamble": "\n\nSpeusippus of Athens was the son of Plato\u2019s sister Potone; he became\nhead of the Academy on Plato\u2019s death in 348/347 and remained its head\nfor eight years (Diogenes Laertius iv 1), apparently until his death.\nHis date of birth is harder to get a fix on; it has reasonably been\nestimated at ca. 410. He apparently wrote a lot: \u201ca great many\ntreatises and many dialogues\u201d (ibid. iv 4; Diogenes\nlists about 30 titles, and his bibliography is on his own admission\nincomplete). We have very little of what he wrote, if any (we have\nsomething from a work later attributed to him, On Pythagorean\nNumbers, discussed below, but this is not one of Diogenes\u2019\ntitles; and we may have something preserved in Iamblichus, De\ncommuni mathematica scientia iv, also discussed\nbelow).\n\nDiogenes tells us (iv 1) that Speusippus \u201cabided by the views of\nPlato\u201d; from what little we can tell, this is simply false. In\nparticular, Speusippus rejected the Theory of Forms.\n\nReferences will be to the primary sources; the two most recent\ncollections of the fragments (Isnardi Parente 1980, Tar\u00e1n 1981)\nhave indices that will enable the reader to locate the texts (Lang\n1911 does not). Citations from Plato and Aristotle are to any standard\nedition; those from other ancient authors are taken from texts listed\nin the bibliography (translations are in all cases my own, but where\nan alternative English translation is available, I have given a\nreference to it).\n\nWhat we can infer, mostly from Aristotle but with a few supplements\nfrom other authors, will be covered under three headings:\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Metaphysics\n\nAristotle gives us an account of Plato\u2019s metaphysical views that goes\nconsiderably beyond what we find in Plato\u2019s dialogues. In fact,\nAristotle gives us what he says are Plato\u2019s views and also those of\nothers. From this we learn what little we can about Speusippus and his\ncontemporary, Xenocrates.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, all three of Plato, Speusippus, and Xenocrates\nconstructed their worlds operating with two principles\n(archai): the One and something opposed to it. The latter\nappears under different names, and it looks as if the different names\ngo with different ones among the three: \u2018the Indefinite\nDyad\u2019 or \u2018the large and (the) small\u2019 seem to be the\nexpressions favored by Plato, \u2018plurality\u2019 seems to be\nassociated with Speusippus, and \u2018the unequal\u2019 with\nXenocrates. And for Plato, the One was identified with the Good. These\nphilosophers employed these two principles, according to Aristotle, to\ngenerate derivative entities (substances, beings) of other types:\nForms, numbers, and so on. This generation was laid out as if it were\na process in time, but the generation-story was to be understood\ninstead as one understands a mathematical construction: the\nconstruction takes place in time, but what is constructed is an\neternal structure. And in this eternal structure the principles were\nnot temporally first, but first in relation to the dependence on them\nof the things constructed.\n\nThese principles are primarily employed by these three thinkers in\nconnection with numbers. But there are two ranges of number\noperating in Aristotle\u2019s discussions (see Metaphysics I 6,\nXIII 8\u20139). There are what he refers to as formal\nnumbers, one for each numeral; these are the (Platonic) Forms for\nnumbers. But since there is only one for each numeral, and a\nmathematician has to be able to add two and two to get four, there is\nanother range of numbers required: the mathematical numbers,\nindefinitely many for each numeral n, each of the\nindefinitely many a collection of n units. As Aristotle has\nit, Plato accepted both ranges, and Speusippus only mathematical\nnumbers; Speusippus, then, rejects Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms and\nspecifically his belief in formal numbers.\n\nThere are only two passages in which Aristotle mentions Speusippus by\nname in dealing with his metaphysical views: Metaphysics VII\n2. 1028b21 and XII 7. 1072b31. Neither passage gives us anything we\ncould call a \u2018fragment\u2019: there is no indication that any\nactual quoting is taking place. But it is from these meager hints that\nreconstruction of Speusippus\u2019 metaphysics must start.\n\nThe method followed in the reconstruction of Speusippus\u2019 views is a\nmatter of chaining: we start from our two anchor texts, and look for\nother passages in which the views ascribed to him in them are under\ndiscussion. Those passages will sometimes bring in new views; we then\nascribe those views to Speusippus, and go looking for passages in\nwhich those views seem to be alluded to. No one needs to be\ntold how tenuous such chaining is: each link is weak, and compounding\nprobabilities would tell us that a chain of this type is actually\nweaker than its weakest link. But chaining in that way is all we can\ndo. Fortunately, it results in a fairly coherent picture.\n\nIn the first of our two anchor texts, Aristotle, discussing the ways\nin which people have answered the question \u2018what are the\nsubstances?\u2019, ascribes to Plato the view that there are not only\nperceptible substances but eternal ones of two types: forms and\nmathematical objects. He then says that Speusippus thought there were\neven more types of substance; he \u201cstarted from the One\u201d\nand adopted principles (archai) for each of his types of\nsubstance: \u201cone for numbers, another for magnitudes, then for\nsoul\u201d. So we have at least four layers of beings: numbers,\nmagnitudes, souls, and perceptible beings; the One is Speusippus\u2019\nstarting-point, but he has different principles for each level of\nbeing.\n\nIn the other of our anchor texts, Aristotle, having just sketched a\nproof for the existence of an unmoved mover, which he refers to as a\nprinciple (arche) and as \u2018god\u2019, says something\nabout Speusippus\u2019 views about principles: that he (and the\nPythagoreans) suppose that a principle is not characterizable as\n\u2018beautiful\u2019 or \u2018good\u2019, going on the analogy of\nplants and animals, where beauty and goodness emerge in the end state\nrather than the beginning. So, although we have principles at each\nlevel, those principles are not themselves complete entities at that\nlevel.\n\nThen we begin chaining.\n\nIn Metaphysics XIV 4\u20135, Aristotle discusses various\nPlatonistic views about the relationships between the first principles\nand goodness; XIV 4. 1091a34\u201336 refers to contemporaries of\nAristotle\u2019s who deny that the good is among the principles but suppose\nit comes in later in the development; the second of our two anchor\ntexts warrants the guess that Speusippus is among them. And then some\nother things about the passage in XIV fall into place: Speusippus\u2019\nmain way of referring to the principle opposed to the One was\n\u2018plurality\u2019, and, more importantly, he denied a theory\nabout causality that was part of Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms as we find\nthat Theory in, say, the Phaedo: a theory to the effect that\nthe possession of a feature F by a perceptible object was due\nto its participation in something supremely F that transmits\nits being F to the perceptible object; as opposed to this\n\u2018Transmission Theory of Causality\u2019, Speusippus adopted\nwhat we might call a Principle of Alien Causality: the first cause of\nFs is not itself F. This Principle is going to be\ndifficult to formulate, and the word \u2018first\u2019 in this\nformulation needs emphasis: Speusippus surely agrees with Aristotle\nthat the cause of a human being is one or more other human beings, so\npresumably the Principle has to be restricted in some way to\nfirst causes or principles in some more robust\nsense. Unfortunately, the texts (even the Iamblichean passage cited\nbelow) give us no help here.\n\nMetaphysics XIV 5. 1092a11\u201317 returns to the analogy of\nanimals and plants which XII 7 told us Speusippus used; Aristotle\nsays:\n\n\nAnd one does not rightly understand either if one compares the\nprinciples of the whole to that of animals and plants, because from\nindefinite, incomplete things the more complete always arise, which is\nwhy he says it holds thus for the first things, so that the one itself\nis not even a being.\n\n\nSticking by our method of chaining, we add to Speusippus\u2019 package the\nclaim that the One is not a being (1092a14\u201315). And this is an\ninstantiation of the Principle of Alien Causality: the first cause of\nbeings is not itself a being.\n\nAristotle goes on to speak of \u201cthose who say that the beings are\nderived from elements and that of the beings the numbers are the\nfirst\u201d (1092a21\u201322). And again we may suppose that\nSpeusippus is among them: he would say that the elements, not being so\nderived, are not beings, and that numbers, derived from those\nelements, are the first beings. Here we may go back to the first of\nour anchor texts (Metaphysics VII 2. 1028b21) for some\nconfirmation.\n\nThere may be additional confirmation in a more remote source. In a\nLatin translation of part of Proclus\u2019 commentary on Plato\u2019s\nParmenides (the original Greek for this part of the\ncommentary has not survived), Proclus tells us that \u201cthe one is\nprior and a cause of being, therefore it itself according to its\nexistence is not a being, as supporting being; nor does it partake of\nbeing\u201d, and that Speusippus also subscribes to this view,\nalthough Speusippus states it \u201cas if reporting the sentiments of\nthe ancients.\u201d Unfortunately, if this does go back to\nSpeusippus, it may have been contaminated by neoplatonic elements, for\nProclus has Speusippus saying that the ancients thought \u201cthe one\nbetter than being and that from which the being derives\u201d, and\nthis should not be Speusippus, given his rejection of the claim that\nthe One is good (see above). But Speusippus\u2019 rejection of this claim\nwould have been so bizarre to a neoplatonist that perhaps Proclus\nsimply managed to read past it. Perhaps what Proclus (or his source)\nread is that the One is \u2018above\u2019 being and that from which\nbeing derives, and, given his neoplatonic mindset, unhesitatingly\nthought \u2018better than\u2019.\n\nIt has seemed to many scholars that Speusippus\u2019 denial that the One is\na being gains plausibility from Plato\u2019s Republic: VI\n509b2\u201310 has often been read as placing the Form of the Good\n(which, according to the tradition stemming from Aristotle, Plato\nidentifies with the One) \u2018beyond being\u2019 and so making the\ntop of Plato\u2019s ontological ladder not a being, either. But this is\ninconsistent with other passages in the Republic in which the\nForm of the Good is plainly said to be a being (e.g., VII 518cd,\n526e), and the phrase often translated \u2018beyond being\u2019 in\n509b can be read simply as meaning \u2018on the far edge of\nbeing\u2019. This does not mean that there is nothing pertinent in\nPlato; there is, in the later dialogues, especially the\nParmenides (see below). But Republic VI\n509b2\u201310 cannot be cited in support of Speusippus\u2019 view.\n\nIf we accept this much, then, by further chaining, it looks as if we\nhave a quotation or at least paraphrase of Speusippus\u2019 views\nconcerning the One, plurality, the numbers, and even geometrical\nobjects in a chapter of the De communi mathematica scientia\n(On Mathematical Science in General, hereafter DCMS)\nof\u00a0 Iamblichus (3rd century C.E.). Iamblichus was a student of\nPorphyry, who was in turn a student of Plotinus: this is the beginning\nof Neoplatonism, and there are many resemblances as well as\ndifferences between Neoplatonism and Speusippus\u2019 views. But a case has\nbeen made (Merlan 1968) for the idea that chapter iv of DCMS\ncontains paraphrase if not quotation from Speusippus.\n\nIamblichus is known for something that we should call\n\u2018plagiarism\u2019: he often quotes without attribution. This\ncannot have seemed in any way wrong to him: one of his quotations is a\nlongish stretch from Plato\u2019s Republic, and he is not, of\ncourse, claiming that for his own. Presumably it is an act of homage:\nIamblichus is thinking that he can certainly not do better for what he\nwants to say than Plato, so he, with reverence but not attribution,\nquotes. The hope is that he is doing this in iv. There we read:\n\n\nFor the mathematical numbers one must posit two things, the first and\nhighest principles, the One (which indeed one ought not yet even call\na being, because of the fact that it is simple and because of the fact\nthat it is a principle for the things that are, while the principle is\nnot yet such as are the things of which it is a principle), and again\nanother principle, that of plurality, which can in its own right\nprovide division as well, and for this reason we may, by way of making\na comparison appropriate to its capacity, assert it to be like some\nmoist and completely pliable matter; from which, the one and the\nprinciple of plurality, there is produced the first kind, of numbers,\nfrom both of these when combined with the help of some persuadable\nnecessity.\n\n\nA bit later in the chapter, Iamblichus or his source says:\n\n\nBut it is fit to call the one neither beautiful nor good, because of\nthe fact that it is above the beautiful and the good; for it is when\nnature proceeds farther away from the things in the beginning that,\nfirst, the beautiful appears, and, second, when the elements have an\neven longer distance, the good. \n\n\nAlso in DCMS iv, we find:\n\n\nBut the elements from which the numbers are produced do not yet belong\nthere as either beautiful or good; but from the combination of the one\nand the matter that is cause of plurality number exists, and first in\nthese that which is and beauty appear, while next from the elements of\nlines geometrical substance appears, in which in the same way there is\nthat which is and the beautiful, but in which there is nothing either\nugly or bad; but at the extreme in the fourth and fifth levels which\nare combined from the last elements badness comes-to-be, not directly,\nbut from inadvertence and failing to master something of that which\naccords with nature. \n\n\nThe picture here is not Iamblichus\u2019 own; rather, it fits with, and\nexpands on, what we so far have of Speusippus. There are four levels\nof beings, and above them on a level of its own the One, which is not\na being.\n\nAnd here, in the first quoted passage, we are given two arguments to\nthe effect that the One is not a being.\n\nThe first is an argument from the assumed simplicity of the One. This\ncorresponds to things we can find in Plato. In what is frequently\nreferred to as the \u2018first hypothesis\u2019 of Plato\u2019s\nParmenides (137c-142a), Parmenides begins (137c) by laying it\ndown that the One cannot be many; he then argues, first (137cd), that\nif the One is, it must be without parts, since otherwise it would be\nmany. Subsequent argumentation makes this a proscription against all\nattempts to predicate anything positive of the One: any such predicate\nwould pluralize the One, make it consist of parts. Ultimately that\nwill include even the predicate \u2018being\u2019: it is supposed to\nfollow that the One \u201cin no way is\u201d (141e9\u201310), that\nit is not; that is to say, that it is not a being (e11). It is\ndifficult to believe that Plato himself would have bought this\nargument and its conclusion. He did buy into some of the train of\nthought: see Sophist 244b-245e. But both Plato (even in the\nSophist) and Aristotle seem prepared to infer from a\npredication of the form \u2018S is P\u2019 a\nconclusion of the form \u2018S is\u2019, whereas in the first\nhypothesis of the Parmenides and in DCMS iv we have\nan argument that goes from a predication of the form \u2018the One is\nF\u2019 to the conclusion \u2018the One is not\u2019. This\nis not the place to attempt to sort out the relationship between the\nPlatonic passages and Speusippus, but the interesting suggestion has\nbeen made (Graeser 1997, 1999; see also Halfwassen 1993) that Plato is\nresponding to Speusippus in the Parmenides. At any rate, the\nArgument from Simplicity for the One\u2019s not-being goes back to the\nAcademy.\n\nThe second argument for the not-being of the One depends explicitly on\nthe Principle of Alien Causality: \u201cthe principle is not yet such\nas are the things of which it is a principle\u201d; hence the\nprinciple of beings cannot itself be a being.\n\nAfter the One comes the second level, the first beings, numbers, and\nthen magnitudes or geometrical shapes: here we first encounter beauty\nand goodness. And finally the fourth and fifth levels are going to be\nthose of souls and perceptible objects, and it is here that ugliness\nand badness appear.\n\nThe level of numbers comes about when the second principle, plurality,\nkicks in. One of the more confusing things about this level is that\nSpeusippus seems to have supposed that among the numbers was the\nnumber 1: in this he was apparently ahead of his time, for the\ngenerally accepted view was that 1 is not a number (for this see\nAristotle, Metaphysics, book X, Euclid, Elements vii\ndef. 2, proof of prop. 1, et passim). That Speusippus accepted the\nnumber 1 follows from the mathematics of the one extensive fragment of\nhis work that we have: a quotation preserved in pseudo-Iamblichus,\nTheologumena arithmeticae (see below). But if this is so, it\nis essential to recall that we are dealing with Aristotle\u2019s\n\u2018mathematical\u2019 numbers, where there is a\nplurality for each number. So there is a plurality of numbers 1 (so\nthat we can add 1 and 1 to get 2, etc.). Then the One is not the\nnumber 1; the latter comes about when you get a plurality of units,\nany of which counts as a 1, any couple of which counts as a 2, and so\non. That the One is not the number 1 is only what we should expect,\ngiven the Principle of Alien Causality: the principle for numbers is\nnot itself a number.\n\nAristotle more than once complains of Speusippus\u2019\n\u2018episodic\u2019 universe: apparently the train of causality did\nnot start with the One and go down through the various levels, but\nstarted anew at each level. This is explicit in Metaphysics\nVII 2, cited above: Speusippus had new principles for each level of\nbeings. We need not suppose that the One is different at each level of\nbeing in Speusippus\u2019 universe; the text in DCMS would have it\nthat the One is the same principle throughout, but because of\ndifferences in what it refers to as the \u2018matter\u2019 (see\nquotation above), the One is realized in different ways at each level:\nas the number 1, or the unit, in plurality at the level of numbers, as\nthe point, in what DCMS calls \u2018place\u2019 or, we\nmight translate, \u2018locus\u2019, at the level of geometrical\nfigures. The net effect is that what operates at the beginning of the\narithmetical level is the realization of the One in plurality, the\nunit, which, as it were, represents the One at that level, and what\noperates at the beginning of the geometrical level is the realization\nof the One in locus, the point, which similarly represents the One at\nthat level.\n\nWe may have a fair amount of information about what Speusippus thought\nabout numbers, preserved in pseudo-Iamblichus\u2019 Theologumena\narithmeticae (already mentioned). This book is a compilation from\nvarious authors: Anatolius, Nicomachus of Gerasa, possibly Iamblichus\nhimself, possibly authors unknown. It discusses various properties of\neach of the first ten numbers. When it gets to the number 10, the\n\u2018decad\u2019, after a section that looks as if it descends from\nNicomachus, it begins to speak of Speusippus and a book of his which\nit says was entitled \u2018On Pythagorean Numbers\u2019 and\nwas compiled from various Pythagorean writings, especially those of\nPhilolaus (82.10\u201315: that the book had that title and that\nPhilolaus or any other Pythagorean was a source for Speusippus are\nboth problematic claims). After what purports to be a description of\nthe book (82.15\u201383.5), it introduces a long quotation from\nSpeusippus himself concerning the number 10.\n\nThe description preceding the quotation begins (82. 20) with a passage\non the first half of Speusippus\u2019 book, telling us that it talked about\nnumbers of various types and the five so-called \u2018Platonic\nsolids\u2019 (the tetrahedron or pyramid, the cube, the octahedron,\nthe dodecahedron, and the icosahedron, assigned in the Platonic\ntradition starting with Timaeus 54d-56b to the elements of\nwhich the universe was composed and to the universe itself or to the\nfifth element, ether). This is relatively unproblematic.\n\nThe second half of the book, the author tells us, was about the number\n10, the decad. Unfortunately, the description of that half of the book\nthat precedes the quotation contains some wording which it seems\nimpossible to ascribe to Speusippus. The author tells us that\nSpeusippus showed that the number 10 was \u201ca sort of artistic\nform for the cosmic accomplishments, obtaining in its own right (and\nnot because we use it nor as it happens), and lying before the god\nthat is maker of the all as an all-complete paradigm\u201d (De\nFalco/Klein 1975, p. 83.2\u20135, Waterfield 1988, p. 112). The\ntrouble is that we have already got Speusippus rejecting the Theory of\nForms, and in particular denying that aspect of the Theory in which\nthe forms are treated as \u2018paradigms\u2019: ideal cases that\ntransmit their properties to things that participate in them.\n\nAs it happens, this passage is too good to be true: it is almost\nverbatim what Nicomachus himself wants (see Nicomachus\u2019\nIntroductio arithmeticae I vi 1, Hoche 1866 p. 12.1\u201312,\nD\u2019Ooge et al. 1926 p. 189 e.g.). So it seems best not to ascribe it to\nSpeusippus.\n\nThe quotation itself is another matter. But it, too, offers a problem:\nif Speusippus is telling us what Pythagoreans (perhaps especially\nincluding Philolaus) thought, need he be subscribing to the views\nhimself? Speusippus and Xenocrates, among others, were part of a\nrevival of interest in Pythagoreanism within the Academy; it is often\nthought that in the course of this revival Pythagorean views became\ndistorted through the attempt to assimilate them to the views of one\nor another member of the Academy: the revival plainly involved\nAcademicians adopting the views they were ascribing to the\nPythagoreans. And as for our quotation from Speusippus, what text we\nhave certainly shows no disposition on his part to be critical of the\nviews he is allegedly reporting. So perhaps the best conclusion to\nadopt, albeit very tentatively, is that he endorses these views.\n\nIn the quotation Speusippus tells us that the number 10 is\n\u2018perfect\u2019 or \u2018complete\u2019. The explanation in\nEuclid vii Def. 23 (Heiberg/Stamatis 1970 p. 105; Def. 22 in Heath\n1926 p. 278) for the phrase \u2018perfect number\u2019 is\n\u2018number that is the sum of its proper divisors\u2019. This\nmakes the first perfect numbers 6, 28, and 496: 10 is not a perfect\nnumber in this sense. Rather, Speusippus appears to be speaking of 10\nas \u2018perfect\u2019 or \u2018complete\u2019 in a way that fits\nwith his claim that completeness is not there in the beginning but\nonly comes on once the universe has proceeded a certain way, in\nparticular, far enough that we can speak of numbers. What he means can\nbe illustrated by a single example.\n\nHe tells us that a perfect number has to be even, since otherwise it\nwould contain more odd numbers than even ones: a perfect number must\nhave equally many odd and even numbers in it. On that basis he\npronounces 10 perfect.\n\nThis does not look like a mathematically (or philosophically)\ninteresting conception of perfect numbers, and the same is true of the\nother points Speusippus makes in favor of the perfection of the number\n10. But it does incorporate one feature of great interest: on the face\nof it, if Speusippus thinks that within the number 10 there are just\nas many odd as even numbers, he must be counting 1 as an odd number,\nand therefore a number. (The alternative, which actually must finally\nbe considered seriously, is that he is not counting 2 as a number,\neither, but this does not seem likely.) That makes him, as already\nnoted, an exception in his time and place.\n\nWhen we try to consider Speusippus\u2019 metaphysical views as they bear on\nthe other levels of his universe, unfortunately, we have virtually\nnothing further to tell us what is going on: nothing that tells us\neither what might be the representative of the One or what the\nmaterial principle might be at the level of souls, or at the level of\nperceptible bodies. A passage in Stobaeus (Eclogues I 49.32,\nWachsmuth & Hense 1884 p. 364.2\u20137) that apparently descends\nfrom Iamblichus\u2019 De anima tells us that he defined the soul\n\u201cby the extended in every direction\u201d, but this continues\nto resist interpretation.\n2. Epistemology\n\nAristotle says, in Posterior Analytics II 13.\n97a6\u201311:\n\n\nThere is no need for one who is defining and dividing to know all the\nthings that are. And yet some say that it is impossible to know the\ndifferences between something and each other thing while one does not\nknow each other thing, and without the differences one cannot know\neach thing, for a thing is the same as that from which it does not\ndiffer, and it is other than that from which it differs. \n\n\nThe ancient commentators (see esp. Anonymous In An. post.\n584.17\u2013585.2, where the ascription is credited to Eudemus) tell\nus that this is Speusippus\u2019 position (it has antecedents in Plato,\nPhilebus 18c and Theaetetus 208c-e).\n\nIt is a version of what is sometimes called \u2018holism\u2019:\nknowing something involves knowing where it is located among\neverything else. In this particular context, knowing a thing appears\nto be a matter of knowing its definition, and its definition is\nsomething arrived at by the Platonic method of division (there is room\nfor controversy here: see Falcon 2000). An example suggested by what\nAristotle says elsewhere in this same chapter (96a24-b1, much\nsimplified) might be an attempt to define the number 3 as follows:\n\n\n(Dtriad) a triad =df a number, odd, prime \n\n\nWe reach this definition by successive divisions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then the view being ascribed to Speusippus is that knowing the\nnumber 3 is knowing where 3 is on such a grid, along with knowing\nwhere every other number on the grid is.\n\nIt is very difficult to imagine sustaining this epistemological\nholism. It might seem easier if we confined the view to things like\nmathematics. But we already know that Speusippus\u2019 universe extended\nbeyond the realm of mathematical objects, and it seems quite likely\nthat another division suggested by Aristotle in that chapter\n(96b30\u201335) would be acceptable (at least in principle) to\nSpeusippus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difficulty of sustaining the idea that knowing man is a\nmatter of knowing its position on a tree that locates absolutely every\nanimal, or even every ensouled thing, or (worse yet) absolutely\neverything, is enormous. But it looks as if Speusippus would have been\ncommitted to this.\n\nFor we find this in Sextus Empiricus, Adversus mathematicos\nvii 145\u2013146 (Bury 1935 pp. 80, 81):\n\n\n\u2026 but Speusippus said that, since of things some are\nperceptible and others intelligible, the criterion of the intelligible\nones is the scientific account, and that of the perceptible ones is\nthe scientific perception. Scientific perception he understood to be\nthat which partakes of the truth in accordance with the account. For\njust as the fingers of the flautist or harpist have an artistic\nactuality, yet one that is not completed in them in the first\ninstance, but perfected on the basis of discipline conforming to\nreasoning, and as the perception of the musician has an actuality that\ncan grasp what is in tune and what is out of tune, and this is not\nself-grown but comes about on the basis of reasoning, so also the\nscientific perception partakes of its scientific practice as naturally\nderived from the account, leading to the unerring discrimination of\nthe subjects.\n\n\nThe use of the word \u2018scientific\u2019 should not lead one away\nfrom the main point: it translates a word that means \u2018pertaining\nto knowledge\u2019, and Speusippus is claiming that there is\nknowledge at the level of perceived objects. There is no indication\nthat he gave up his holism at this point. So he seems to be committed\nto defending a rather drastic position.\n\nAnd he seems to have pursued knowledge at the level of perceived\nobjects with considerable zeal. We have book-titles such as\nDefinitions and Likes in which Speusippus apparently\nattempted with some zeal to locate various species of plants and\nanimals on something like a division-tree, although the details are\nnot extant. What we hear about Speusippus\u2019 efforts is, for\nexample:\n\n\nMARSHWORTS: Speusippus in book II of Likes says they grow in\nwater, their leaf resembling marsh celery. (Athenaeus II 61c; Gulick\n1927 pp. 266, 267.)\n\nSpeusippus in the Likes calls the melon a\n\u2018gourd\u2019. (Athenaeus II 68e; Gulick 1927 pp. 298, 299.)\n\nSpeusippus in book II of Likes says that trumpet-shells,\npurple-fish, snails, and clams are similar. \u2026 Again, Speusippus\nenumerates next in order, in a separate division, clams, scallops,\nmussels, pinnas, razorfish, and in another class oysters, limpets.\n(Athenaeus III 86c,d; Gulick 1927 pp. 372, 273.)\n\nSpeusippus in book II of Likes says that, of the soft-shells,\nthe crayfish, lobster, mollusc, bear-crab, crab, paguros are\nsimilar. (Athenaeus III 105b; Gulick 1927 pp. 450, 451.)\n\n\nThere are a total of twenty-five such citations in Athenaeus. Most\nsimply record that Speusippus said one organism was like another (as\nwith the last two), or simply record differences of terminology that\nhappened to catch Athenaeus\u2019 eye (as with the second one). The only\none that promises anything more is the first one above, and that\nhardly promises much. But it has been supposed (see Tar\u00e1n 1981)\nthat it implies that Speusippus differentiated species of animals on\nthe basis of features that would not have counted as differentiae in\nAristotle\u2019s way of classifying animals: differences of locale. And it\nis certainly possible that Speusippus\u2019 holism involved a rejection of\nAristotle\u2019s essence-accident distinction: if we take the text quoted\nabove from Aristotle as implying that someone who knows marshworts\nmust know every respect in which they are like or unlike every other\norganism in the universe, and every such differentiating feature is as\ngood as any other in defining them, then we have abandoned the project\nof differentiating organisms as it appeared to Aristotle.\n\nThis line of thought has suggested to some (see Tar\u00e1n 1981)\nthat the criticism of the Method of Division in Aristotle\u2019s Parts\nof Animals I 2\u20133 constitutes a criticism of Speusippus.\nThis possibility remains highly controversial.\n\nIt appears from Simplicius\u2019 Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories (Kalbfleisch 1907 38.19\u201324) that Speusippus\napplied his method of division, however it worked, to language: there\nwe hear of a division of terms even more elaborate than Aristotle\u2019s in\nthe opening chapter of the Categories: there we hear of\nhomonyms, synonyms, and paronyms, but Speusippus differentiated\nbetween tautonyms (uses of the same term), within which there are\nhomonyms (same term but different definitions) and synonyms (same term\nand same definition), and heteronyms (different terms), within which\nthere are heteronyms proper (different names, different things),\npolyonyms (many names, the same thing), and paronyms (as in Aristotle:\ndifferent terms and different things, with one term derivative from\nanother, as \u2018courageous\u2019 and \u2018courage\u2019).\nWhether this classification was not only more elaborate than\nAristotle\u2019s, but also had a different basis (that in Aristotle being a\nclassification of things according to how they are referred to, that\nin Speusippus being a classification of terms themselves), is in\ndispute (Barnes 1971, Tar\u00e1n 1978).\n\nFinally, we know a little bit about Speusippus\u2019 attitude toward the\nepistemology of mathematics. Assuming that Aristotle in\nMetaphysics XIV 3. 1090a25\u201329, 35-b1 is discussing\nSpeusippus (he is talking about \u201cthose who say there is only the\nmathematical number\u201d), Speusippus held that the truths of\nmathematics are not about perceptible things, and that the axioms from\nwhich they follow \u201cfawn on the soul\u201d: that is, perhaps,\nsuggest themselves. And Proclus tells us this (Commentary on Book\nI of Euclid\u2019s Elements, Friedlein 1873 p. 179.8\u201322; Morrow\n1970 p. 141):\n\n\nFor universally, Speusippus says, of the things for which the\nunderstanding is making a hunt, some it puts forward without having\nmade an elaborate excursion, and sets them up for the investigation to\ncome: it has a clearer contact with these, even more than sight has\nwith visible things; but with others, which it is unable to grasp\nstraight off, but against which it makes its strides by inference, it\ntries to effect their capture along the lines of what follows.\n\n\nSo we begin from some sort of intuition by which the axioms suggest\nthemselves and proceed from them to the rest of the mathematical\ntruths.\n\nWe also hear from Proclus of a dispute in the Academy between some,\nwhom we might call \u2018constructivists\u2019, who saw mathematics\nas something like a human construct, and referred to the truths of\ngeometry as \u2018problems\u2019, demanding geometrical\nconstructions, and others, whom we might think of as\n\u2018mathematical realists\u2019, who saw mathematics as describing\nan eternal, unchanging realm of objects, and referred to the truths of\nmathematics as \u2018theorems\u2019 or \u2018objects of\ncontemplation\u2019. Proclus says (Friedlein 1873 pp.\n77.15\u201378.6; Morrow 1970 pp. 63\u201364):\n\n\nBut already among the ancients, some demanded that we call all of the\nthings that follow from the principles theorems, as did Speusippus,\nAmphinomus, and those around them, thinking that for the theoretical\nbranches of knowledge the appellation \u2018theorems\u2019 was more\nappropriate than \u2018problems\u2019, especially in that they make\ntheir accounts about eternal things. For there is no coming-to-be\namong the eternal things, so that the problem could have no place with\nthem, it requiring a coming-to-be and making of that which was not\nbefore, e.g. constructing an equilateral triangle or describing a\nsquare when a line is given, or placing a line at a given point. So\nthey say it is better to say that all these things are, but that we\nlook at their comings-to-be not by way of producing them but by way of\nknowing them, treating the things that always are as if they were\ncoming-to-be. \n\n\nSo Speusippus, as we might have predicted from the foregoing, was\nfirmly in the realist camp.\n\n3. Ethics\n\nSpeusippus certainly wrote about ethics: the bibliography in Diogenes\nlists (in iv 4) one book each on wealth, pleasure, justice, and\nfriendship. But we have nothing that can be properly called a\nfragment.\n\nWe have already seen that Speusippus rejected Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms,\nand that he refused to place the good among the metaphysical first\nprinciples. So he was not obviously prone to the objections of\nAristotle against Platonic ethics in Nicomachean Ethics I 6,\nthe general upshot of which is that Plato\u2019s theory puts the Good out\nof human reach.\n\nSpeusippus appears to have adopted a rather down-to-earth goal, and in\nthis he is a lead-in to Hellenistic concerns. Hellenistic ethics is\ndominated by the identification of the ideal of human happiness as\n\u2018undisturbedness\u2019 (ataraxia). According to\nClement, Stromata II 22, 133 (St\u00e4hlin 1939 p.\n186.19\u201323):\n\n\nSpeusippus, Plato\u2019s nephew, says that happiness is the completed state\nin things that hold by nature, or possession of goods, for which\ncondition all men have desire, while the good ones aim at\nuntroubledness (aochlesia). And the excellences are\nproductive of happiness.\n\n\nThese formulations \u2018anticipate\u2019 Stoic and Epicurean ones:\nthe emphasis on \u2018natural\u2019 conditions is a feature of\nStoicism, and the notion of \u2018untroubledness\u2019 is found in\nEpicurus (see To Menoeceus, in Diogenes Laertius x 127).\n\nThere is an argument implicit in the clause \u201cfor which all men\nhave desire, while the good ones aim at untroubledness\u201d that\nfits in perfectly with a debate about the good and happiness that we\nknow from Aristotle to have been current in the Academy, and in which\nSpeusippus played a leading role. Nicomachean Ethics X 2\nbegins (1172b9\u201310):\n\n\nEudoxus, then, thought pleasure to be the good because he saw all\nthings, both rational and irrational, aiming at it, \u2026. \n\n\nThis sort of \u2018Universal Pursuit Argument\u2019 is one that\nbecame very popular in the Hellenistic period; here we have Eudoxus\napplying it in favor of the claim that pleasure is the good:\n\u2018hedonism\u2019. And Speusippus strenuously denied hedonism\n(see below).\n\nWe might, then, see Speusippus responding to the Universal Pursuit\nArgument construed as favoring hedonism by saying: we should not care\nabout what all things in general aim at, but at what human\nbeings aim at, in fact, more specifically, the good ones\namong them, and what human beings pursue is not pleasure, but the\ncompleted state in things that hold by nature, and the good\nones, more specifically, pursue untroubledness. The word\n\u2018untroubledness\u2019, aochlesia, comes from a verb\nochleein that can just mean \u2018to move\u2019, so\nuntroubledness might well suggest a certain stillness, lack of motion.\nThis will fit with Speusippus\u2019 views on pleasure and pain.\n\nBefore we turn to those, we have a little more with which to flesh out\nSpeusippus\u2019 idea of the good for man; none of it, regrettably, is\nsupplied with argument.\n\nCicero, in various places, ascribes a view to \u201cAristotle,\nSpeusippus, Xenocrates, and Polemon\u201d which he himself rejects.\nIn the Tusculan Disputations he enumerates (V x 29) various\nthings such as poverty, ingloriousness, loneliness, pain, ill health,\netc., which many people (but not he: his own view is the Stoic one\nthat virtue all by itself guarantees happiness) take to be bad things,\nand then says (V x 30, King 1927 pp. 454/455\u2013456/457):\n\n\nTherefore I do not easily give in to \u2026 those ancients,\nAristotle, Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Polemon, since they count the\nthings I have enumerated above among the bad things, and these very\npeople say that the wise man is always happy.\n\n\nCicero is, in the last clause, accusing these people of inconsistency:\nthey think the wise man is always happy, and yet they think there are\nthings such as wealth and health the lack of which would bring about\nunhappiness.\n\nSeneca (Epistulae morales 85.18, Reynolds 1965 i 292, Gummere\n1920 pp. 294, 295) says:\n\n\nXenocrates and Speusippus think that one can become happy even by\nvirtue alone, but not that there is one good, that is morality\n(honestum). \n\n\nThis can be seen as expressive of the same reservation Cicero had. If\nSpeusippus and Xenocrates espoused the view that the virtuous man was\nalways happy but thought that there were non-moral evils such as\npoverty and pain, then they thought that there were non-moral good\nthings as well: the absence of poverty and the absence of pain. So (on\nCicero\u2019s and Seneca\u2019s account) they were not consistent in maintaining\nthat virtue (which incorporates only moral goods) was sufficient for\nhappiness.\n\nAnd it appears that Speusippus and Xenocrates did think that there\nwere non-moral goods; Plutarch, in De communibus notitiis adversus\nStoicos 13. 1065a (Cherniss 1976 pp. 704, 705) refers to\nSpeusippus and Xenocrates as \u201cthinking that health is not\nindifferent and wealth not useless\u201d.\n\nWe are left with two views to ascribe to Speusippus (and to\nXenocrates): that wisdom, or virtue in general, is sufficient for\nhappiness, and that there are non-moral goods the lack of which\nconduces to unhappiness. Cicero\u2019s question as to how these can be\nrendered consistent is a good one, and we have no information about\nhow Speusippus might have answered it.\n\nLet us turn to the one other topic about which we have some purchase\non Speusippus\u2019 ethical views: that of pleasure. Aulus Gellius,\nAtticae noctes IX v 4 (Marshall 1968 p. 284, Rolfe 1927 pp.\n168, 169):\n\n\nSpeusippus and the entire old Academy say that pleasure and pain are\ntwo evils opposed to each other, but that the good is what is in the\nmiddle between the two. \n\n\nThe inclusion of the rest of the Academy along with Speusippus is\npresumably due to the influence of Cicero\u2019s teacher Antiochus\u2019\nunifying efforts. At any rate, there is confirmation that this was\nSpeusippus\u2019 view, from two passages in Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean\nEthics: VII 13, which names Speusippus, and X 2. 1173a5\u201313,\nwhich does not, but repeats the argument of the former passage.\n\nIn the first of those chapters (in 1153b1\u20137) Aristotle mentions\nSpeusippus as having attacked the claim that pleasure is something\ngood. He had canvassed arguments to the effect that pleasure is a bad\nthing earlier in the chapter, and some of the arguments certainly\nsound like Speusippus (1152b12\u201320):\n\n\nAnd so, in favor of the claim that pleasure is not a good at all, it\nis argued (1) that every pleasure is a perceptible coming-to-be toward\na natural state, while no coming-to-be is of the same kind as its\nends, e.g. no house-building is of the same kind as a house. (2)\nAgain, the temperate man avoids pleasures. (3) Again, the intelligent\nman pursues what is painless, not what is pleasant. (4) Again,\npleasures are a hindrance to reflecting, and by as much as one enjoys\nthem, by that much are they more of a hindrance, as with the pleasure\nof sex; for no one could think in the course of that. (5) Again, there\nis no art of pleasure, although everything good is the work of an art.\n(6) Again, children and wild animals pursue pleasures. \n\n\nAssuming that we correctly understood Speusippus\u2019 response to the\nUniversal Pursuit Argument, (2), (3), and (6) are consonant with that\nresponse.\n\nBut (1) plainly echoes material in Plato\u2019s Philebus (see esp.\n53c\u201355a). And that leads to the interesting suggestion that in\nthat dialogue Plato is entering the dispute between Eudoxus and\nSpeusippus. It has been suggested independently of that passage that\nSpeusippus is lurking behind the \u2018harsh thinkers\u2019, the\nanti-hedonists, of 44a-47b (Schofield 1971, Dillon 1996).\n\nIf that is right, and if Graeser\u2019s suggestion that Plato in the\nParmenides is responding to some of Speusippus\u2019 metaphysical\nviews, it is plain that the understanding of some of what is going on\nin late Plato would be aided by an understanding of what was going on\nin Speusippus. The loss of his writings is regrettable indeed.\n",
