Both\nparts were connected in virtue of a correlation that could be\nestablished between selected terms of the theoretical part and\nobservational terms. In the second half of the 1920s, however,\nSchlick\u2019s model, involving separate conceptual systems, was put\naside in favor of a more streamlined conception of scientific theories\nalong lines as suggested by the Aufbau. Clearly, however,\nSchlick\u2019s model represents an early form of the conception of\nscientific theories as uninterpreted calculi connected to observation\nby potentially complicated correspondence rules that Carnap\nreintroduced in (1939) and that became standard in the \u201creceived\nview\u201d. (Another, albeit faint precursor was the idea contained\nin a 1910 remark of Frank\u2019s pointing out the applicability of\nHilbert\u2019s method of implicit definition to the reconstruction\nempirical scientific theories as conceived, also along the lines of\ntwo distinct languages, by the French conventionalists Rey and Duhem;\nsee Uebel 2003.)\n\nEven granted the model in outline, questions arise both concerning its\nobservational base as well as its theoretical superstructure. We\nalready discussed one aspect of the former topic, the issue of\nprotocols, in the previous section; let\u2019s here turn to the\nlatter topic. Talk of correspondence rules only masks the problem that\nis raised by theoretical terms. One of the pressing issues concerns\ntheir so-called surplus meaning over and above their observational\nconsequences. This issue is closely related to the problem of\nscientific realism: are there truth-evaluatable matters of fact for\nscientific theories beyond their empirical, observational adequacy?\nEven though the moniker \u201cneo-positivism\u201d would seem to\nprescribe an easy answer as to what the Vienna Circle\u2019s position\nwas, it must be noted that just as there is no consensus discernible\ntoday there was none in the Circle beyond certain basics that left the\nmatter undecided.\n\nAll in the Vienna Circle followed Carnap\u2019s judgement in\nPseudoproblems of Philosophy (1928b) and Schlick\u2019s\ncontention in his response to Planck\u2019s renewal of anti-Machian\npolemics (1932) that questions like that of the reality of the\nexternal world were not well-formed ones but only constituted\npseudo-questions. While this left the observables of empirical reality\nclearly in place, theoretical entities remained problematical: were\nthey really only computational fictions introduced for the ease with\nwhich they they allowed complex predictive reasoning, as Frank (1932)\nheld? This hardly seems to do justice to the surplus meaning of\ntheoretical terms over and above their computational utility: theories\nemploying them seem to tell us about non-observable features of the\nworld. This indeed was Feigl\u2019s complaint (1950) in what must\ncount as the first of very few forays into \u201csemantical\nrealism\u201d (scientific realism by another word) by a former member\nof the Vienna Circle\u2014and one that was quickly opposed by\nFrank\u2019s instrumentalist rejoinder (1950). Carnap sought to remain\naloof on this as on other ontological questions. So while in the\nheyday of the Vienna Circle itself the issue had not yet come into\nclear focus, by mid-century one could distinguish amongst its\nsurviving members both realists (Feigl) and anti-realists (Frank) as\nwell as ontological deflationists (Carnap).\n\nCarnap\u2019s general recipe for avoiding undue commitments (while\npursuing his investigations of various language forms, including the\nintensional ones Quine frowned upon) was given in terms of the\ndistinction between so-called internal and external questions (1950a).\nGiven the adoption of a logico-linguistic framework, we can state the\nfacts in accordance with what that framework allows us to say. Given\nany of the languages of arithmetic, say, we can state as arithmetical\nfact whatever we can prove in them; to say that there are\nnumbers, however, is at best to express the fact that numbers are a\nbasic category of that framework (irrespective of whether they are\nlogically derived from a still more basic category). As to whether\ncertain special types of numbers exist (in the deflated sense), that\ndepends on the expressive power of the framework at hand and on\nwhether the relevant facts can be proven. Analogous considerations\napply to the existence of physical things (the external world) given\nthe logico-linguistic frameworks of everyday discourse and empirical\nscience. (The near-tautologous nature of these categorical claims in\nCarnap\u2019s hands echoes his earlier diagnosis of metaphysical\nclaims as pseudo-statements; see also 1934/37, Part V.A.) Unlike such\ninternal questions, however, external questions, questions whether\nnumbers or electrons \u201creally exist\u201d irrespective of any\nframework, are ruled out as illegitimate and meaningless. The only way\nin which sense could be given to them was to read them as pragmatic\nquestions concerned with the utility of talk about numbers or\nelectrons, of adopting certain frameworks. Carnap clearly retained his\nbasic position: existence claims remain the\nprovince of science and there must be seen as mediated by the\navailable conceptual tools of inquiry. Logicians of science are in no\nposition to double-guess the scientists in their own proper\ndomain. (Needless to say, Quine 1951b opposed the internal/external distinction as much as his 1951a opposed the analytic/synthetic distinction.)\n\nMatters came to a head with the discovery of a proof (see Craig 1956)\nthat the theoretical terms of a scientific theory are dispensable in\nthe sense of it being possible to devise a functionally equivalent\ntheory that does not make use of them. Did this not rob theoretical\nterms of their distinctive role and so support instrumentalism? The\nnegative answer was twofold. As regards defending their utility,\nCarnap (1963b, \u00a724) agreed with Hempel (1958) that in practice\ntheoretical terms were indispensable in facilitating inductive\nrelations between observational data. As regards the defense of their\ncognitive legitimacy, Carnap held that this demanded determining what\nhe called their \u201cexperiential import\u201d, namely, determining\nwhat specifically their empirical significance consisted in. It was\nfor this purpose that Carnap came to employ Ramsey\u2019s method of\nregimenting theoretical terms. Nowadays this so-called ramseyfication\nis often discussed as a means for expressing a position of\n\u201cstructural realism\u201d, a position midway between\nfully-blown scientific realism and anti-realism and so sometimes\nthought to be of interest to Carnap. Carnap\u2019s own concern with\nramseyfication throws into relief not only the question of the\nviability of one of the Vienna Circle\u2019s most forward-looking\nstances in the debate about theoretical terms\u2014intending to avoid\nboth realism and anti-realism\u2014but also several other issues that\nbear on the question of which, if any, forms of Vienna Circle\nphilosophy remain viable.\n",
