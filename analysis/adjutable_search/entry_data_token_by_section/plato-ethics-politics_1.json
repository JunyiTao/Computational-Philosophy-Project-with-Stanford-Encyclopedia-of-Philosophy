    "main_text": "Introduction: The Question and the Strategy || Rejected Strategies\n1.2 Rejected Strategies\n\n\nAfter the challenge of Glaucon and Adeimantus, Socrates takes off in \na strange direction (from 367e). He suggests looking for justice as a\nvirtue of cities before defining justice as a virtue of persons, on \nthe unconvincing grounds that justice in a city is bigger and more \napparent than justice in a person (368c\u2013369b), and this leads \nSocrates to a rambling description of some features of a good city \n(369b\u2013427c). This may seem puzzling. But Socrates\u2019 indirect approach \nis not unmotivated. The arguments of Book One and the challenge of \nGlaucon and Adeimantus rule out several more direct routes.\n\n\nFirst, Socrates might have tried to settle quickly on a widely \naccepted account of what justice is and moved immediately to \nconsidering whether that is always in one\u2019s interests. But \nBook One rules this strategy out by casting doubt on widely accepted \naccounts of justice. Socrates must say what justice is in order to \nanswer the question put to him, and what he can say is constrained in\nimportant ways. Most obviously, he cannot define justice as happiness\nwithout begging the question. But he also must give an account of \njustice that his interlocutors recognize as justice: if his \naccount of justice were to require torturing red-headed children \nfor amusement, he would fail to address the question that Glaucon and\nAdeimantus are asking.\n\n\nMoreover, Socrates cannot try to define justice by enumerating the \ntypes of action that justice requires or forbids. We might have \nobjected to this strategy for this reason: because action-types can \nbe specified in remarkably various ways and at remarkably different \nlevels of specificity, no list of just or unjust action-types could \nbe comprehensive. But a specific argument in Book One suggests a \ndifferent reason why Socrates does not employ this strategy. When \nCephalus characterizes justice as keeping promises and returning what\nis owed, Socrates objects by citing a case in which returning what is\nowed would not be just (331c). This objection potentially has very \nwide force, as it seems that exceptions could always be \nfound for any action-type that does not include in its description a \nword like \u2018wrong\u2019 or \u2018just\u2019. Wrongful killing\nmay always be wrong, but is killing? Just recompense may always be \nright, but is recompense?\n\n\nSo Book One makes it difficult for Socrates to take justice for\ngranted. What is worse, the terms in which Socrates accepts the\nchallenge of Glaucon and Adeimantus make it difficult for him to take\nhappiness for granted. If Socrates were to proceed like a\nconsequentialist, he might offer a full account of happiness and then\ndeliver an account of justice that both meets with general approval\nand shows how justice brings about happiness. But Socrates does not\nproceed like that. He does not even do as much as Aristotle does in\nthe Nicomachean Ethics; he does not suggest some general\ncriteria for what happiness is. He proceeds as if happiness is\nunsettled. But if justice at least partly constitutes happiness and\njustice is unsettled, then Socrates is right to proceed as if\nhappiness is unsettled.\n\n\nIn sum, Socrates needs to construct an account of justice and an \naccount of happiness at the same time, and he needs these accounts to\nentail without assuming the conclusion that the just person is always\nhappier than the unjust.\n",
