    "main_text": "Pains and Pleasures || Diminishing Marginal Utility\n3.3 Diminishing Marginal Utility\n\nBentham occasionally suggested that pains and pleasures might be\nevaluated in relation to income or wealth, but he was aware of the\nlimitations of this approach. While we might plausibly assume that, of\ntwo individuals with unequal fortunes, the richer of the two would be\nthe happier, it does not follow that adding increments to that\nperson\u2019s wealth will continue to make him happier in the same\nproportion. It is in the nature of the case that the amount of\nincrease in happiness will not be as great as the increase in wealth;\nthe addition of equal increments of money will eventually bring\nsuccessively less of an increase in happiness. Modern economists know\nthis analysis as the law of \u201cdiminishing marginal\nutility\u201d. One of its practical consequences for a utilitarian\nsuch as Bentham is that, where choices present themselves between\ngiving an additional increment to a rich man or to a poor man, more\nhappiness will result from giving it to the poorer of the two. Also,\nthe analysis underscores why money cannot be a direct measure of\nutility, since the utility represented by a particular sum of money\nwill vary depending on the relative wealth of the person who receives\nit. Moreover, it is evident that diminishing marginal utility is also\na feature of the additional increments of pleasure a person may\nexperience beyond a certain point; equal increments of pleasure will\nnot necessarily add to the stockpile of happiness if a person has\nreached a saturation point.\n",
