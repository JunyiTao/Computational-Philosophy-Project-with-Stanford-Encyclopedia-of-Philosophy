Life and Works\n\nThomas Hobbes was born on 5 April 1588. His home town was Malmesbury,\nwhich is in Wiltshire, England, about 30 miles east of Bristol. Very\nlittle is known about Hobbes\u2019s mother. His father, also called\nThomas Hobbes, was a somewhat disreputable local clergyman.\nHobbes\u2019s seventeenth-century biographer John Aubrey tells the\nstory of how \u201cThe old vicar Hobs was a good fellow and had been\nat cards Saturday all night, and at church in his sleep he cries out\n\u2018Trafells is troumps\u2019\u201d [i.e., clubs are trumps]\n(Aubrey 1696, 1.387). The older Thomas Hobbes eventually (in 1604)\nleft Malmesbury, when a dispute with another clergyman, Richard Jeane,\nescalated to the point of a fight in a churchyard. In Aubrey\u2019s\nwords: \u201cHobs stroke him and was forced to fly for it\u201d\n(Aubrey 1696, 1.387).\n\nBy that point the future philosopher Hobbes had himself left\nMalmesbury (in 1602 or 1603), in order to study at Magdalene Hall,\nOxford. His studies there were supported by his uncle, Francis Hobbes,\nwho was a glover. After graduating from Oxford in February 1608,\nHobbes went to work for the Cavendish family, initially as a tutor to\nWilliam Cavendish (1590\u20131628), who later became the second earl\nof Devonshire. Hobbes would work for the same family most of the rest\nof his\n life.[1]\n His work for the Cavendish family is part of what allowed Hobbes to\nthink and write as he did: it gave him access to books, and\nconnections to other philosophers and scientists.\n\nHobbes\u2019s first notable philosophical works are from around 1640.\nBefore then he had, significantly, published in 1629 a translation of\nThucydides\u2019 History of the Peloponnesian War into\nEnglish. Hobbes had also interacted with various prominent\nintellectual figures. On a trip around Europe in the mid-1630s, Hobbes\nmet Marin Mersenne in Paris. Aubrey claims that \u201cWhen he\n[Hobbes] was at Florence \u2026 he contracted a friendship with the\nfamous Galileo Galilei\u201d (Aubrey 1696, 1.366), although\ncuriously Hobbes\u2019s autobiographical writings do not mention\nthis, though they do mention meeting Mersenne. Earlier on, around\n1620, Hobbes worked for some time as a secretary to Francis Bacon.\n\nHobbes first made a notable impact with philosophical writings in the\nearly 1640s. These included his Elements of Law and De\nCive. The Elements of Law, which Hobbes circulated in\n1640, is the first work in which Hobbes follows his typical systematic\npattern of starting with the workings of the mind and language, and\ndeveloping the discussion towards political matters. De Cive\n(1642) was Hobbes\u2019s first published book of political\nphilosophy. This work focuses more narrowly on the political: its\nthree main sections are titled \u201cLiberty\u201d,\n\u201cEmpire\u201d and \u201cReligion\u201d. However, De\nCive was conceived as part of a larger work, the Elements of\nPhilosophy. That work eventually had three parts: De\nCorpore (1655), De Homine (1658), and De Cive\nitself. De Corpore, which is discussed below, covers issues\nof logic, language, method, metaphysics, mathematics, and physics.\nDe Homine, meanwhile, focuses on matters of physiology and\noptics.\n\nAt this time Hobbes also had a series of interactions with Descartes.\nIn 1640 Hobbes sent to Mersenne a set of comments on Descartes\u2019s\nDiscourse and Optics. Descartes saw some of this,\nand sent a letter to Mersenne in response, to which Hobbes also\nresponded. Then in 1641 Hobbes\u2019s objections were among those\npublished along with Descartes\u2019s Meditations. In these\nexchanges and elsewhere, the attitudes of Hobbes and Descartes to one\nanother involved a curious mixture of respect and dismissal. On the\none occasion they are said to have met, in 1648, they did not get\nalong well (Martinich 1999, 171). In earlier letters, Descartes\nsuggested that Hobbes was more accomplished in moral philosophy than\nelsewhere, but also that he had wicked views there (Descartes 1643,\n3.230\u20131). Descartes also worried that Hobbes was \u201caiming\nto make his reputation at my expense, and by devious means\u201d\n(Descartes 1641b, 100). Aubrey reports that the two \u201cmutually\nrespected one another\u201d, but also that Hobbes thought that\nDescartes would have been better off sticking to geometry (Aubrey\n1696, 1.367).\n\nHobbes spent the next decade in exile in Paris, leaving England late\nin 1640, and not returning until 1651. His exile was related to the\ncivil wars of the time. Hobbes was associated with the royalist side,\nand might also have had reason to fear punishment because of his\ndefence of absolute sovereignty in his political philosophy. During\nhis time in France, Hobbes continued to associate with Mersenne and\nhis circle, including Pierre Gassendi, who seems to have been a\nparticular friend of Hobbes\u2019s. Late in his time in France,\nHobbes wrote Leviathan, which was published in 1651. Its\nstructure is somewhat similar to that of the Elements of Law,\nthough it also contains lengthy discussions of matters of scriptural\ninterpretation, and it is probably the most overtly polemical of\nHobbes\u2019s major works.\n\nAfter his return to England in 1651, Hobbes continued to publish\nphilosophical works for several years. De Corpore was\npublished in 1655, and provides Hobbes\u2019s main statements on\nseveral topics, such as method and the workings of language. De\nHomine was published in 1658, completing the plan of the\nElements of Philosophy. In later years Hobbes defended his\nwork in a series of extended debates. These included debates with John\nWallis and Seth Ward that centred on Hobbes\u2019s alleged squaring\nof the circle (Jesseph 1999), debates with John Bramhall about liberty\nand necessity (Jackson 2007), and debates with Robert Boyle about the\nexperimental physics of the Royal Society (Shapin & Schaffer\n1989). He also published a Latin edition of Leviathan in\n1668, in which there were some significant changes and additions\nrelating to controversial topics, such as his treatments of the\nTrinity and the nature of God. But Hobbes\u2019s attention was not on\nphilosophy alone. Indeed, in the 1670s he published translations of\nthe Odyssey and Iliad. And in the late 1660s he\nwrote a history of the civil wars, Behemoth; or, The Long\nParliament, which was published posthumously (Hobbes 1668a).\n\nHobbes died on 4 December 1679 at Hardwick Hall, one of the homes of\nthe Cavendish family, with whom he was still associated after seventy\nyears.\n2. Mind and Language\n\nAt an abstract level, The Elements of Law, the Elements\nof Philosophy, and Leviathan all share a structure.\nHobbes begins with questions about mind and language, and works\ntowards questions in political philosophy. How exactly the parts of\nthe system are connected has long been debated. But Hobbes thinks at\nleast that we will better understand how individuals interact in\ngroups if we understand how individuals work. Thus the first part of\nThe Elements of Law is titled \u201cHuman Nature\u201d and\nthe second \u201cDe Corpore Politico\u201d (i.e., \u201cAbout the\nBody Politic\u201d). Hobbes did not insist it was necessary to work\nthrough all the issues about individuals before tackling the issues\nabout groups, as he acknowledged when he published the third part of\nthe Elements of Philosophy (De Cive) first. But he\ndid think it helpful. Thus even in Leviathan, with its focus\non political and religious matters, Hobbes starts with a story about\nthe workings of the mind. The first six chapters work through issues\nabout the senses, imagination, language, reason, knowledge, and the\npassions.\n2.1 Sense and Imagination\n\nHobbes is a sort of empiricist, in that he thinks all of our ideas are\nderived, directly or indirectly, from\n sensation.[2]\n In addition he tells a causal story about perception, which is\nlargely the story of a causal chain of motions. The object causes\n(immediately or mediately) pressure on the sense organ, which causes\nmotion inside us, all the way to the \u201cbrain and heart\u201d.\nThere this motion causes \u201ca resistance, or counter-pressure, or\nendeavour of the heart to deliver itself; which endeavour, because\noutward, seemeth to be some matter without. And this\nseeming, or fancy, is that which men call\nsense\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 1.4). Quite why this endeavour from inside\nto out should make the sensation seem to come from outside is unclear,\nfor things coming from outside should be moving the other way. At any\nrate, the sensation is strongly grounded in, perhaps even identical\nwith, the internal motions. But what, we might ask, is the quality?\nWhat is, say, red? In this chapter Hobbes seems happy to say that red\nin the object is just motions in it, and that red in us is motions in\nus, which give rise to or are a certain sensation. And he seems happy\nto avoid the issue of whether red itself belongs to the sensation or\nthe object. In the Elements of Law, however, he had proposed\nthe Galilean view that colours inhere in perceivers, not in the\nobjects perceived (Hobbes 1640, 2.4)\n\nImagination is Hobbes\u2019s next topic. His basic thought is that\nour sensations remain after the act of sensing, but in a weaker way:\n\u201cafter the object is removed, or the eye shut, we still retain\nan image of the thing seen, though more obscure than when we see\nit\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 2.2). This is a story about how we form ideas.\nMore generally, imagination has a crucial role in Hobbes\u2019s\npicture of the workings of the mind. One sort of imagination is what\nwe would now call imagination, \u201cas when from the sight of a man\nat one time, and of a horse at another, we conceive in our mind a\nCentaur\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 2.4). That is, we can take the ideas, the\nfaded sensations, from different experiences and combine them\ntogether. But Hobbes also connects imagination, and \u201cthe faculty\nof imagining\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 2.10) closely to memory and to\nunderstanding. Imagination and memory, Hobbes says, are the same\nthing, with two names that point to different aspects of the\nphenomenon of decaying sense. If we want to point to the idea or image\nitself, we use \u2018imagination\u2019, but if we want to point to\nthe decay, we use \u2018memory\u2019 (Hobbes 1651, 2.3).\n\nMoreover, Hobbes thinks that understanding is a sort of imagination.\nThat is, the faculty of imagining is responsible for understanding, as\nwell as for compounding images and for memory. Understanding is,\nHobbes says, \u201c[t]he imagination that is raised in man (or any\nother creature endued with the faculty of imagining) by words or other\nvoluntary signs\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 2.10). Understanding is not\nrestricted to humans. So, for example, \u201ca dog by custom will\nunderstand the call \u2026 of its master\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 2.10).\nBut humans have a sort of understanding that other creatures lack. A\ndog, for instance, can understand the will of its owner, say that its\nowner wants it to sit down. In general, the understanding that\nnon-human animals can have is the understanding of will. But humans\ncan also understand the \u201cconceptions and thoughts\u201d (Hobbes\n1651, 2.10) of others from their uses of language.\n\nUnderstanding is for Hobbes the work of the faculty of imagination,\nand crucially involves language. An account of the workings of\nlanguage is thus crucial for his having an account of the workings of\nthe mind. For Hobbes, the mind contains sense, imagination, and the\nworkings of language, and no further rational faculty, such as the\nCartesian immaterial mind that can grasp natures by clear and distinct\nperception. His story about sensation, the formation of ideas, and the\nworkings of imagination is supposed to explain how some of our thought\nworks. But only with the further story about language and\nunderstanding in place does he have a full alternative to\nDescartes\u2019s story about our cognitive faculties. For Descartes,\nsense and imagination are, as in Hobbes\u2019s story, closely\nconnected to the workings of the brain, but higher cognitive functions\nare performed by the immaterial mind. Hobbes denies the existence of\nthat immaterial mind, and needs other accounts of those functions.\nThis \u2013 combined no doubt with some independent interest in the\ntopic \u2013 leads to Hobbes devoting a fair amount of attention to\nissues in the philosophy of language.\n2.2 Signification\n\nHobbes\u2019s account of language is crucial for his account of the\nmind, and has important connections to his views in political\nphilosophy (Pettit 2008). Reading Hobbes\u2019s various accounts of\nlanguage, it quickly becomes clear that the notion of signification is\ncentral. It is apparently the central semantic relationship in\nHobbes\u2019s story, playing the sort of role that\u2019s played in\nmore recent accounts by meaning or sense or reference (Abizadeh 2015;\nP\u00e9charman 2004). But what is signification? One important\nquestion here is whether and how Hobbes distinguishes signification\n(and the thing signified) from naming (and the thing named).\n\nWhen Hobbes introduces his story about names in the The Elements\nof Law he tells us that \u201cA NAME or APPELLATION therefore is\nthe voice of a man, arbitrarily imposed, for a mark to bring to his\nmind some conception concerning the thing on which it is imposed.\nThings named are either the objects themselves, as man; or the\nconception itself that we have of man, as shape or motion; or some\nprivation, which is when we conceive that there is something which we\nconceive, not in him\u201d (Hobbes 1640, 5.2\u20133). That is,\nHobbes first introduces names as having a private use for individuals,\nto help them to bring particular ideas to mind. (Hobbes uses\n\u2018name\u2019 in a very broad sense. In that chapter alone, he\ngives \u2018Socrates\u2019, \u2018Homer\u2019, \u2018man\u2019,\n\u2018just\u2019, \u2018valiant\u2019, \u2018strong\u2019,\n\u2018comely\u2019, and \u2018faith\u2019 as example of names.)\nNotice here that though the point of using names is to recall ideas,\nthe thing named is not necessarily an idea. It may well be an external\nobject such as, in Hobbes\u2019s example, a man. Later in that\nchapter, Hobbes starts to talk explicitly about signifying rather than\nnaming. Thus in talking about ambiguity Hobbes says that \u201cthe\nword faith sometimes signifieth the same with belief; sometimes it\nsignifieth particularly that belief which maketh a Christian; and\nsometimes it signifieth the keeping of a promise\u201d (Hobbes 1640,\n5.7). However, it is not at all clear that he really means to\nintroduce signifying as a relation distinct from naming here. Indeed,\nhe seems rather to be giving the same relation two different\nnames.\n\nIn Leviathan and De Corpore something more complex\ngoes on (Duncan 2011). The equivalent chapters in Leviathan\nand De Corpore start in the same way, with discussions of the\nrole of names as marks to aid the memory (Hobbes 1651, 4.3; Hobbes\n1655, 2.1). However, both then go straight on to introduce another\nrole for names, as signs to the hearer of the speaker\u2019s thoughts\n(Hobbes 1651, 4.3; Hobbes 1655, 2.2\u20135). And\n\u2018signify\u2019 appears to be the verb corresponding to what\nsigns do. Though there are hints of this account in\nLeviathan, it is set out in most detail in De\nCorpore. There Hobbes says that names alone are not signs:\n\u201cthey are not signs except insofar as they are arranged in\nspeech and are its parts\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 2.3). So when we talk\nabout signification, it\u2019s the act of signifying, of\ncommunicating one\u2019s thoughts by using words that are a sign of\nthem, that is basic. In other terminology, while words name things,\nit\u2019s utterances that have signification.\n\nSomeone might think that, and nevertheless have a derivative notion of\nwhat a word signifies. Hobbes takes some steps in this direction. In\nparticular, we can understand two words having the same signification\nas their being interchangeable without changing the signification of\nthe utterance (Hungerland and Vick 1981, 68). Thus Hobbes uses\n\u2018signify\u2019 when talking about a translation relation, as\nwhen he says in Leviathan that \u201cthe Greeks call it\nfancy, which signifies appearance\u201d (Hobbes\n1651, 2.2). And some interpreters go further, and take Hobbes to\nbelieve that words signify ideas, which are the ideas they call to\nmind when used in utterances.\n2.3 Nominalism\n\nHobbes is a nominalist: he believes that the only universal things are\nnames (Hobbes 1640, 5.6\u20137; Hobbes 1651, 4.6\u20138; Hobbes\n1655, 2.9). The word \u2018tree\u2019 is, Hobbes thinks, a universal\nor common name that names each of the trees. There is one name, and\nthere are many trees. But there is not, Hobbes argues, some further\nthing that is the universal tree. Nor is there some universal idea\nthat is somehow of each or all of the trees. Rather,\n\u2018tree\u2019 names each of the trees, each of the individuals to\nwhich the term applies (not, note, the collection of them).\n\nWhat Hobbes calls common names, those words which apply to multiple\nthings, are applied because of similarities between those things, not\nbecause of any relation to a universal thing or idea. There are, in\nthe minds of speakers, ideas related to those names, but they are not\nabstract or general ideas, but individual images of individual things.\nI could use \u2018tree\u2019 now, associating it with a tall pine\ntree, and tomorrow use \u2018tree\u2019 but have before my mind a\nshort beech tree. What matters, Hobbes says, is that \u201cwe\nremember that vocal sounds of this kind sometimes evoked one thing in\nthe mind, sometimes something else\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 2.9).\n\nHobbes\u2019s nominalism was recognized by his contemporaries, but\nwas also criticized as going too far. Leibniz put the point as\nfollows.\n\n\nHobbes seems to me to be a super-nominalist. For not content like the\nnominalists, to reduce universals to names, he says that the truth of\nthings itself consists in names and what is more, that it depends on\nthe human will, because truth allegedly depends on the definitions of\nterms, and definitions depend on the human will. This is the opinion\nof a man recognized as among the most profound of our century, and as\nI said, nothing can be more nominalistic than it. Yet it cannot stand.\nIn arithmetic, and in other disciplines as well, truths remain the\nsame even if notations are changed, and it does not matter whether a\ndecimal or a duodecimal number system is used (Leibniz 1670, 128).\n\n\nSimilar worries, that Hobbes\u2019s views could not account for the\nfact that the same truths can be expressed in different languages,\nwere expressed by Descartes in his reply to Hobbes\u2019s objections\nto the Meditations (Descartes 1641a, 2.126) and by Henry More\nin his Immortality of the Soul (More 1659, 133\u20134).\nHobbes would apparently say, given his story about signification, that\n\u201cThis bag is red\u201d has the same signification as\n\u201cDiese Tasche ist rot\u201d. However, he does endorse various\nclaims about aspects of language and truth being conventional and\narbitrary. Some such claims are widely agreed upon: whether we write\nfrom left to right or right to left, for instance, and what particular\nmarks we choose to represent words on paper. But Hobbes also endorses\nother, more controversial, claims of this sort. Most controversially\nperhaps, Hobbes thinks that there is a conventionality and\narbitrariness in the way in which we divide the world up in to kinds.\nThough the application of \u2018red\u2019 to some objects and not\nothers is based on similarities between those objects, the\nsimilarities do not demand that we group exactly those objects\ntogether under a name. That is, the groupings and kinds, though based\nin similarities, are not determined by those similarities alone, but\nalso and primarily by our decisions, which involve awareness of the\nsimilarities, but also an arbitrary element. This introduces an extra\narbitrary element into the truth of \u2018This bag is red\u2019, for\neven if all the underlying similarities had been the same, we might\nhave, say, drawn the line between red and orange in a different place.\nHowever, it\u2019s not at all clear that such arbitrariness gives\nrise to the problematic consequences that Descartes and Leibniz think\nit does (Bolton 1977).\n2.4 Reasoning as Computation\n\nHobbes describes reasoning as computation, and offers sketches of the\ncomputation that he thinks is going on when we reason. This idea might\nappear to have significant connections to later views, both to some\nviews of Leibniz\u2019s and to more recent approaches that adopt a\ncomputational theory of mind. This section looks at Hobbes\u2019s\npresentation of the idea, and then briefly at these two possible\nconnections.\n\nIn De Corpore Hobbes first describes the view that reasoning\nis computation early in chapter one. \u201cBy reasoning\u201d, he\nsays \u201cI understand computation. And to compute is to collect\nthe sum of many things added together at the same time, or to know the\nremainder when one thing has been taken from another. To reason\ntherefore is the same as to add or to\nsubtract\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 1.2). In the section that follows,\nHobbes gives some initial examples of addition in reasoning, which are\nexamples of adding ideas together to form more complex ones. Thus\n\u201cfrom the conceptions of a quadrilateral figure, an equilateral\nfigure, and a rectangular figure the conception of a square is\ncomposed\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 1.3). That\u2019s but a small part of\nour mental activity though. Hobbes also describes propositions and\nsyllogisms as sorts of addition:\n\n\na syllogism is nothing other than a collection of a sum which is made\nfrom two propositions (through a common term which is called a middle\nterm) conjoined to one another; and thus a syllogism is an addition of\nthree names, just as a proposition is of two (Hobbes 1655, 4.6).\n\n\nA proposition is in a sense formed by adding the name of the predicate\nto the name of the subject, so by adding \u2018snow\u2019 and\n\u2018white\u2019 we get \u2018snow is white\u2019. (We add\n\u2018is\u2019 as well, but as Hobbes argues, it\u2019s not\nnecessary, for we could indicate the same thing by word order rather\nthan having an extra word as the copula.) In thinking about\nsyllogisms, think about the example \u201cEvery man is an animal;\nevery animal is a body; therefore every man is a body\u201d (Hobbes\n1655, 4.4). In some sense we add the propositions, or at least bits of\nthem: we add the subject of the first proposition to the predicate of\nthe second, aided in this by the middle term. \n\nThis is an intriguing suggestion, but seems not to be very far\ndeveloped. This addition has to follow some rules, especially in the\nsyllogistic case. As Hobbes says, \u201cEvery man is an animal; some\nanimal is a quadruped; therefore, some man is a quadruped\u201d is\n\u201cdefective\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 4.4). But its conclusion too\ninvolves the addition of parts of the premises. Presumably syllogistic\naddition, like arithmetic addition, must have its rules. And of\ncourse, Hobbes was aware of the properties of various good and bad\narguments. But it\u2019s not clear what he added to that discussion\nby bringing in the language of addition. Nor, indeed, is it clear what\nhe really added to his discussion of the workings of the mind by his\noccasional use of such language.\n\nNevertheless, the notion that reasoning is computation has been\nreferred back to more than once. Leibniz explicitly endorsed and\ndeveloped it in one early work: \u201cThomas Hobbes, everywhere a\nprofound examiner of principles, rightly stated that everything done\nby our mind is a computation, by which is to be understood\neither the addition of a sum or the subtraction of a difference\n\u2026 So just as there are two primary signs of algebra and\nanalytics, + and \u2212, in the same way there are as it were two\ncopulas, \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018is not\u2019\u201d (Leibniz\n1666, 3). And the idea appears to have continued to hold some appeal\nfor him. Thus for example Leibniz\u2019s numerical characteristic\n(Leibniz 1679) attempts in another way to use the language of addition\nand subtraction to explain aspects of reasoning.\n\nMuch more recently, some philosophers discussing the computational\ntheory of mind have also seen connections to Hobbes\u2019s idea. The\ncentral idea of a modern computational theory of mind is that the mind\nis a sort of computer. More precisely and technically, \u201cthe\nimmediately implementing mechanisms for intentional laws are\ncomputational \u2026 [Computations] viewed in intension,\nare mappings from symbols under syntactic description to symbols under\nsyntactic description\u201d (Fodor 1994, 8). And very roughly, we\nmight see Hobbes as saying the same thing. There are various mental\nprocesses (compounding ideas, forming propositions, reasoning\nsyllogistically) that we can describe without knowing that reasoning\nis computation. But the underlying process that\u2019s making this\nall work is computation, namely, addition and subtraction. The\nconnections seem to amount to no more than that though, so it\u2019s\nat least rather over-dramatic to say that Hobbes was\n\u201cprophetically launching Artificial Intelligence\u201d\n(Haugeland 1985, 23).\n3. Materialism\n\nBy the time of Leviathan and De Corpore, Hobbes was\nconvinced that human beings (including their minds) were entirely\n material.[3]\n Later on he came to think that even God was a sort of material being\n(Gorham 2013, Springborg 2012). This section focuses on Hobbes\u2019s\nmaterialism about human beings. This was not a popular or widely-held\nposition at the time. Hobbes, however, was a materialist. Why was he a\nmaterialist?\n\nWe might suspect that Hobbes\u2019s story about the workings of mind\nand language (e.g., in the early chapters of Leviathan) is\nsupposed to be an implicit argument for materialism.\n\u2018Look\u2019, we might take Hobbes to be saying, \u2018I can\nexplain all the workings of the mind using only material resources.\nWhat need is there to postulate an immaterial mind when this perfectly\ngood, and more minimal, explanation is available?\u2019 Hobbes\nperhaps suggests this when he notes that his nominalism means we do\nnot need to suppose there\u2019s any faculty other than imagination\nin order to understand how universal thought works (Hobbes 1655, 2.9).\nHowever, for the most part we do not find Hobbes explicitly stating\nthat argument. Instead he presents a series of arguments against\nvarious opponents\u2019 beliefs in immaterial beings (including\nimmaterial human minds).\n\nThere is a prominent suggestion in Leviathan that our\ndiscourse about incorporeal things constitutes \u201cinsignificant\nspeech\u201d.\n\n\nAll other names are but insignificant sounds; and those of two sorts.\nOne when they are new, and yet their meaning not explained by\ndefinition; whereof there have been abundance coined by schoolmen, and\npuzzled philosophers.\n\nAnother, when men make a name of two names, whose significations are\ncontradictory and inconsistent; as this name, an incorporeal\nbody, or (which is all one) an incorporeal\nsubstance, and a great number more. For whensoever any\naffirmation is false, the two names of which it is composed, put\ntogether and made one, signify nothing at all (Hobbes 1655,\n4.20\u20131).\n\n\nThus Hobbes apparently thinks that talk about incorporeal substances\n(such as Cartesian unextended thinking things) is just nonsense. But\nwhy does he think that? Hobbes\u2019s comment about false\naffirmations suggests he thinks that \u2018incorporeal\nsubstance\u2019 is insignificant because \u2018a substance is\nincorporeal\u2019 is false. But that seems to derive the\ninsignificance from the truth of materialism, which is hardly going to\nconvince Hobbes\u2019s opponents. Hobbes does offer a supporting\nargument, when he claims that \u2018incorporeal substance\u2019 and\n\u2018incorporeal body\u2019 are \u201call one\u201d. But that\npremise too will be denied by his opponents, who think that there can\nbe substances that are not bodies, and that \u2018substance\u2019\nand \u2018body\u2019 are far from interchangeable terms.\n\nHobbes offers a further argument against his opponents\u2019 belief\nin immaterial things in De Corpore, in a passage in which he\ntalks at length about the \u201cgross errors\u201d of\nphilosophers.\n\n\nBut the abuse consists in this, that when some men see that the\nincreases and decreases of quantity, heat, and other accidents can be\nconsidered, that is, submitted to reasons, as we say, without\nconsideration of bodies or their subjects (which is called\n\u201cabstraction\u201d or \u201cexistence apart from them\u201d),\nthey talk about accidents as if they could be separated from every\nbody. The gross errors of certain metaphysicians take their origin\nfrom this; for from the fact that it is possible to consider thinking\nwithout considering body, they infer that there is no need for a\nthinking body; and from the fact that it is possible to consider\nquantity without considering body, they also think that quantity can\nexist without body and body without quantity, so that a quantitative\nbody is made only after quantity has been added to a body. These\nmeaningless vocal sounds, \u201cabstract substances,\u201d\n\u201cseparated essence,\u201d and other similar ones, spring from\nthe same fountain (Hobbes 1655, 3.4).\n\n\nThe key mistake, Hobbes thinks, lies in moving from the observations\nthat we can talk about \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, and can\nthink about A without thinking about B, to the conclusion that A can\nexist without B existing. Hobbes attacks various views associated with\nthe Scholastic Aristotelian tradition as resting on that mistake. One\naim of this critical passage is to support materialism by showing a\nproblem with the belief that there can be thought without a body.\nHobbes elsewhere claims that Aristotle thinks that \u201cthe human\nsoul, separated from man, subsists by itself\u201d, so presumably has\nAristotle and Aristotelians in mind as targets (Hobbes 1668b,\n46.17).\n\nWhen Hobbes talks about Aristotelian views, one might ask whether his\ntarget is Aristotle himself, or some later Aristotelians. When Hobbes\ntalks about Aristotelian metaphysics in particular, his main approach\nseems to be to take a certain core view to have been\nAristotle\u2019s, then to criticize both that view and the further\nuses that were made of it. Hobbes\u2019s attitude to Aristotelianism\ncomes across forcefully in a discussion in Behemoth that\nbegins by describing Peter Lombard and John Duns Scotus as writing\nlike \u201ctwo of the most egregious blockheads in the world\u201d\n(Hobbes 1668a, 41\u20132). That exchange has several elements: the\ncondemnation of the philosophical view as nonsensical; the claim that\nsome philosophers aim to confuse; and the claim that views are\npromoted in order to control the public and take their money. However,\nthough Hobbes rejected many of the views of the Scholastic\nAristotelian tradition, his work had several connections\nto it, as is illustrated by Leijenhorst 2002.\n\nThe view that there can be thought without a body is also\nDescartes\u2019s view. Indeed, Hobbes may be thinking of\nDescartes\u2019s argument for that view in the Sixth Meditation. A\nkey claim in Descartes\u2019s argument is that \u201cthe fact that I\ncan clearly and distinctly understand one thing apart from another is\nenough to make me certain that the two things are distinct\u201d\n(Descartes 1641a, 2.54). Descartes argues, via that claim, from his\nability to clearly and distinctly conceive of mind apart from body and\nvice versa, to the conclusion that mind and body are really distinct\n(i.e., are two substances, not one). Abstracting away from the\ndetails, we have an argument from the conceivability of mind without\nbody to the conclusion that the mind is not physical. And such an\nargument is one of Hobbes\u2019s targets in the \u201cgross\nerrors\u201d passage.\n\nHowever Descartes, by endorsing that argument, does not endorse the\nclaim that \u2018if I can conceive of A\u2019s existing without\nB\u2019s existing, then A can exist without B existing\u2019. He\nendorses at most the weaker claim that \u2018if I can clearly and\ndistinctly conceive of A\u2019s existing without B existing, then A\ncan exist without B existing\u2019. There\u2019s a special sort of\nconceivability involved here, clear and distinct conceivability, which\nlicenses the move in this case but not in general. Hobbes\u2019s\nargument seems blind to this distinction.\n\nOverall then, something of a puzzle remains. Hobbes clearly was a\nmaterialist about the natural world, but the explicit arguments he\noffers for the view seem rather weak. Perhaps he just had a good deal\nof confidence in the ability of the rapidly developing science of the\nhis time to proceed towards a full material explanation of the mind.\nJust as his contemporary William Harvey, of whom he thought very\nhighly, had made such progress in explaining biological matters, so\ntoo (Hobbes might have thought) might we expect further scientists to\nsucceed in explaining mental matters.\n4. Method\n\nHobbes was very much interested in scientific explanation\nof the world: both its practice (which he saw himself as engaged in)\nand also its theory. Chapter 9 of Leviathan tells us\nsomething about the differences between scientific and historical\nknowledge, and the divisions between sciences. Chapter 6 of De\nCorpore gives a much fuller treatment of issues in the philosophy\nof science, issues of what Hobbes calls method. Method tells us how to\ninvestigate things in order to achieve scientia, the best\nsort of knowledge.\n\nThose writing about Hobbes\u2019s method have tended to tell one or\nother of two stories about the sort of method he proposes and its\nhistorical roots. One story emphasizes the connections between\nHobbes\u2019s method and Aristotelian approaches. This has often been\ndeveloped into a story about the particular influence on Hobbes of the\nworks of Giacomo Zabarella, a sixteenth-century Aristotelian who\nstudied and taught at the University of Padua, which influence is then\noften said to have been somehow mediated by Galileo. The alternative\nstory emphasizes the connections between Hobbes\u2019s general views\nabout method and the traditions of thinking about method in geometry.\nHere the notions of analysis and synthesis are key. Oddly enough, both\nof these stories can be connected to anecdotes that Aubrey tells about\nHobbes: on the one hand, the report that Hobbes became friendly with\nGalileo while traveling in Italy, and on the other, the tale of how\nHobbes became fascinated with geometry at the age of forty after\nlooking at copy of Euclid\u2019s Elements, not believing a\nproposition, and tracing back the demonstration of it and the\npropositions on which it depended.\n\nThis section tells a version of the first story. (For a helpful recent\ncritical discussion of such an approach, see Hattab 2014.) Still, one\nshould note that Hobbes sometimes uses the language of mathematical\nmethod, of analysis and synthesis, in describing his general method\n(Hobbes 1655, 6.1). Several commentators have seen this, together with\nhis clear admiration for the successes of geometry, as evidence of a\nmore general use of mathematical notions in his account of method\n(Talaska 1988). Adams 2019 argues that Hobbes \u201cproceeds by a\nmethod of synthetic demonstration\u201d in both geometry and\npolitical philosophy. And it might indeed be the case that both\nstories about Hobbes\u2019s method (the Zabarellan and the\nmathematical) have some truth to them.\n \nThose writing about Hobbes often describe Zabarella\u2019s method as\nhaving two parts, resolution and composition. Resolution moves from\nthe thing to be explained, which is an effect, to its causes, and then\ncomposition brings you back from causes to effects. At a suitably\ngeneral level that is correct, but it misses much detail. Most\nimportantly, Zabarella\u2019s method \u2014 as seen for instance in\nhis work De Regressu \u2013 is better described as having\nthree parts. A crucial though somewhat mysterious third step stands\nbetween the move from effect to cause and that from effect to cause.\nThe complete sequence, the arguments from effect to cause and back\nagain, Zabarella calls regressus. This sequence improves our\nknowledge, taking us from confused to clear knowledge of something.\nBut how do we do this? The first step is to move from having confused\nknowledge of the effect to having confused knowledge of the cause.\nRoughly, you need to figure out what caused the thing you\u2019re\ntrying to explain. The second step moves from confused to clear\nknowledge of the cause. This step works, Zabarella thinks, by a sort\nof intellectual examination of the cause. The aim is not just to know\nwhat thing is the cause, but to understand that thing. The final step\nthen moves from the clear knowledge of the cause to clear knowledge of\nthe effect. That is, your new full understanding of the cause gives\nyou better understanding of the thing caused by it.\n\nChapter six of De Corpore is Hobbes\u2019s main work on\nmethod. There Hobbes lays out a model of the proper form of a\nscientific explanation. A proper explanation tells you three things:\nwhat the cause is, the nature of the cause, and how the cause gives\nrise to the effect. Thus Hobbes accepts the Aristotelian idea that to\nhave the best sort of knowledge, scientific knowledge, is to know\nsomething through its causes. Similarities to Aristotelian theories\nsuch as Zabarella\u2019s show up even in section one of chapter six.\nHere Hobbes defines philosophy as knowledge acquired by correct\nreasoning. It is both knowledge of effects that you get through\nconception of their causes and knowledge of causes that you get\nthrough conception of their visible effects. Already we see signs of\nthe Aristotelian picture in which you come to know the cause by\nknowing the visible effect and to know the effect by knowing the\ncause.\n\nMoreover, there is perhaps in Hobbes\u2019s method something like the\nmiddle step of regressus. For Hobbes, to know an effect\nthrough its causes is to know what the causes are and how they work:\n\u201cWe are said to know scientifically some effect\nwhen we know what its causes are, in what subject they are, in\nwhat subject they introduce the effect, and how they do it\u201d\n(Hobbes 1655, 6.1). The requirement to know how the cause works, not\njust what it is, is analogous to the Zabarellan requirement to have\ndistinct knowledge of a cause. Knowledge that the cause exists comes\nfrom the first step of regressus. Complete\nregressus, i.e., complete explanation, requires that you make\na fuller investigation of the cause. For Hobbes, analogously, to get\nto scientia of the effect you need to understand, not just\nwhat the causes are, but how they work.\n\nComparison of Hobbes\u2019s view to Zabarella\u2019s and other more\nfully Aristotelian ones is complicated by Hobbes\u2019s thinking that\nall causes are efficient causes and that motion is the cause of all\nchange in the natural world. In a more fully Aristotelian picture,\nexplanations are causal, but causes can be of several sorts.\nHobbes\u2019s picture is more restrictive: to find the causes is to\nfind the efficient causes. Moreover, he thinks the efficient causes\nare all motions, so the search for causes becomes the search for\nmotions and mechanisms.\n\nFor all that there do seem to be similarities between Hobbes\u2019s\nmethod and older Aristotelian approaches, one might well wonder how\nHobbes could have come to know about Zabarella\u2019s views in\nparticular. One story is that Hobbes learned about this method from\nGalileo, but that claim is problematic. Galileo did know about\nZabarella\u2019s ideas and other similar ones (Wallace 1984).\nHowever, the texts of Galileo in which signs of Zabarellan ideas are\nevident are early ones, but Hobbes knew Galileo\u2019s thought\nthrough his later published works. But even if the\nZabarella-Galileo-Hobbes story is hard to support, there are other\nways in which Hobbes might have learned of Zabarella\u2019s work.\nHarvey, whose work Hobbes greatly admired, and who studied at the\nmedical school in Padua, might also have been an intermediary (Watkins\n1973, 41\u20132). And it\u2019s far from ridiculous to contemplate\nHobbes reading the work of the popular logician Zabarella.\n5. Philosophy of Religion\n\nHobbes\u2019s views about religion have been disputed at great\nlength, and a wide range of positions have been attributed to him,\nfrom atheism to orthodox Christianity. This section focuses on two\ncentral questions: whether Hobbes believes in the existence of God,\nand whether he thinks there can be knowledge from revelation. Some\nimportant aspects of Hobbes\u2019s approach to religion are left\naside. These include religion\u2019s role in politics (Lloyd 1992),\nand the question of whether God plays some fundamental role in\nHobbes\u2019s ethical system (see Warrender 1957 and Martinich 1992,\nbut also Nagel 1959 and Darwall 1994).\n\nHobbes at one point rules a good deal of religious discussion out of\nphilosophy, because its topics are not susceptible to the full\ndetailed causal explanation that is required for scientia,\nthe best sort of knowledge. \u201cThus philosophy excludes from\nitself theology, as I call the doctrine about the nature and\nattributes of the eternal, ungenerable, and incomprehensible God, and\nin whom no composition and no division can be established and no\ngeneration can be understood\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 1.8). Also excluded\nare discussion of angels, of revelation, and of the proper worship of\nGod. But despite these not being, strictly speaking, philosophy,\nHobbes does in fact have a good deal to say about them, most notably\nin Leviathan. Things outside philosophy (in its strict sense)\nmay not be amenable to thorough causal explanation in terms of the\nmotions of bodies, but they may well still be within the limits of\nrational discussion.\n\nMany people have called Hobbes an atheist, both during his lifetime\nand more recently. However, the word \u2018atheist\u2019 did not\nmean the same thing in the seventeenth century as it means now. Thus\nwhen Mintz (1962), in a study of Hobbes\u2019s critics that often\nmentions atheism, summarizes the reasons those critics gave for\ncalling Hobbes an atheist, he lists the views\n\n\nthat the universe is body, that God is part of the world and therefore\nbody, that the Pentateuch and many other books of Scripture are\nredactions or compilations from earlier sources, that the members of\nthe Trinity are Moses, Jesus, and the Apostles, that few if any\nmiracles can be credited after the Testamental period, that no persons\ndeserve the name of \u2018martyr\u2019 expect those who witnessed\nthe ascension of Christ, that witchcraft is a myth and heaven a\ndelusion, that religion is in fact so muddled with superstition as to\nbe in many vital places indistinguishable from it, [and] that the\nChurch, both in its government and its doctrine, must submit to the\ndictates of Leviathan, the supreme civil authority (Mintz 1962,\n45).\n\n\nThus, many of Hobbes\u2019s critics in the seventeenth century,\nincluding those who vehemently attacked his religious views, still\nthought he believed in the existence of God. They thought, however,\nthat he was a rather dubious sort of Christian. Other critics,\nhowever, have thought that Hobbes in fact denied the existence of God.\nThis might seem a curious allegation, for Hobbes often talks about God\nas existing. Certainly, to read Hobbes in this way requires one to\ntake some of his statements at something other than face value.\n\nIn the Elements of Law Hobbes offers a cosmological argument\nfor the existence of God (Hobbes 1640, 11.2). However, he argues, the\nonly thing we can know about God is that he, \u201cfirst cause of all\ncauses\u201d, exists. Our knowledge is limited in this way because\nour thoughts about God are limited: \u201cwe can have no conception\nor image of the Deity\u201d. So when we seem to attribute features to\nGod, we cannot literally be describing God (Hobbes 1640, 11.3).\nWe\u2019re either expressing our inability, as when we call God\nincomprehensible, or we\u2019re expressing our reverence, as when we\ncall God omniscient and just. The same indeed is going on when we call\nGod a spirit: this is not \u201ca name of anything we\nconceive\u201d, but again a \u201csignification of our\nreverence\u201d (Hobbes 1640, 11.3).\n\nThose three views \u2014 support for a cosmological argument, the\nbelief that God is inconceivable by us, and the interpretation of\napparent descriptions of God as not really descriptions \u2014 appear\nto recur in Leviathan (Hobbes 1651, 11.25, 12.6\u20139).\nHowever, in later work, such as the appendix to the 1668 Latin edition\nof Leviathan, Hobbes proposes a different view. The older\nHobbes thought that we could know God to have at least one feature,\nnamely extension. In his Answer to Bishop Bramhall, Hobbes\ndescribes God as a \u201ccorporeal spirit\u201d (Hobbes 1662,\n4.306). By this he means at least that God is extended. Indeed, Hobbes\nseems to think of God as a sort of extended thing that\u2019s mixed\nthrough the rest of the world, not being in every individual place in\nthe world, but able to affect all the things in the world (Hobbes\n1662, 4.306\u201313, especially 4.309\u201310).\n\nWhatever one thinks of the orthodoxy of Hobbes\u2019s earlier views\n\u2014 and one might take the holder of those views just to be a very\nserious believer in the rather orthodox view that God is\nincomprehensible \u2014 this later view that God is corporeal is\nstrange indeed. However, Hobbes does seem in his Answer to Bishop\nBramhall and the Appendix to the Latin edition of\nLeviathan to believe this strange view sincerely. Indeed, he\ngoes to some pains to defend this as an acceptable version of\nChristianity. Whether or not one believes that, this is still on the\nsurface an odd theism rather than atheism.\n\nEven if Hobbes is some sort of theist, he\u2019s a theist who is\nsceptical about many widely held religious views. This is notable to\nsome extent in his critical reading of biblical texts, which was not\nat all a standard approach at the time. Indeed, Hobbes and Spinoza\noften get a good deal of credit for developing this approach.\nIt\u2019s notable too in his treatment of matters related to\nrevelation.\n\nIn chapter 2 of Leviathan Hobbes comes to these topics at a\nslightly surprising point. In the course of discussing the workings of\nimagination, he talks naturally enough about dreams. Emphasizing the\noccasional difficulty of distinguishing dreams from waking life, he\nturns to talk of visions. Dreams had in stressful circumstances, when\none sleeps briefly, are sometimes taken as visions, Hobbes says. He\nuses this to explain a supposed vision had by Marcus Brutus, and also\nwidespread belief in ghosts, goblins, and the like. Later he uses it\nto account for visions of God (Hobbes 1651, 32.6). And Hobbes\nexplicitly uses this to undermine the plausibility of claims to know\nthings because told by God:\n\n\nTo say he [God] hath spoken to him in a dream is no more than to say\nthat he dreamed God spake to him, which is not of force to win belief\nfrom any man that knows dreams are for the most part natural and may\nproceed from former thoughts \u2026 To say he hath seen a vision, or\nheard a voice, is to say that he hath dreamed between sleeping and\nwaking; for in such a manner a man doth many times naturally take his\ndream for a vision, as not having well observed his own slumbering\n(Hobbes 1651, 32.6)\n\n\nThis does not rule out the possibility that God might indeed\ncommunicate directly with an individual by means of a vision. But it\ndoes rule out other people sensibly believing reports of such\noccurrences, for the events reported are easily (and usually if not\nnecessarily always correctly) given a natural explanation as dreams,\nwhich themselves have natural causes.\n\nHobbes takes a similarly sceptical attitude to reports of miracles.\nChapter 37 of Leviathan is a discussion of this topic,\ncentred on Hobbes\u2019s definition of a miracle as \u201ca work\nof God (besides his operation by the way of nature, ordained\nin the creation), done for the making manifest to his elect\nthe mission of an extraordinary minister for their\nsalvation\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 37.7). Though there is some\ndispute about exactly what Hobbes is doing there, there clearly is a\ngood deal of talk about \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cpretended\u201d\nmiracles, with an emphasis on the possibility of trickery, and a\nwarning about believing too hastily in reports of miracles. The\nconclusion is weaker than that of Hume\u2019s more famous argument\nabout the evidence for belief in miracles, but a similar sceptical\nattitude is present.\n\nThe case has often been made, however, that Hobbes was not just\nsomewhat sceptical about some religious claims, but actually denied\nthe existence of God. The idea is that, though Hobbes says that God\nexists, those statements are just cover for his atheism. Moreover,\nthese interpreters claim, there are various pieces of evidence that\npoint to this hidden underlying view. Opinions differ on what the\ncrucial evidence of the hidden atheism is. Jesseph (2002), for\ninstance, argues that Hobbes\u2019s claims about a material God do\nnot add up. Curley (1992) argues that Hobbes\u2019s discussions of\nprophecy and miracles, taken together, contain a suggestive\nproblem.\n\n\nThere is (what I would take to be) a fairly obvious problem of\ncircularity here: in the chapter on miracles we are to judge the\nauthenticity of a miracle by the authenticity of the doctrine it is\nused to support, but in the chapter on prophecy we had to judge the\nprophet\u2019s claim to be God\u2019s spokesman by his performance\nof miracles. If Hobbes is aware of this circularity, he does not call\nattention to it. Perhaps he just did not notice it. Perhaps, as\nStrauss might have suggested, he leaves it to the reader to discover\nthis for himself. (Curley 1992, \u00a75).\n\n\nThere are some tricky general methodological questions here, about\nwhen we can reasonably say that an author is trying to communicate a\nview other than the one apparently stated. Note, however, that for\nsomeone allegedly covering up his atheism to avoid controversy, Hobbes\ntook the curious approach of saying many other intensely controversial\nthings. He was opposed to free will and to immaterial souls, opposed\nto Presbyterianism and to Roman Catholicism, and managed to have\nanti-royalists thinking he was a royalist, but at least one prominent\nroyalist (Clarendon) thinking he supported Cromwell. This was not a\nrecipe for a quiet life. One might see Hobbes as thinking that these\nthings could be said with controversy, but God\u2019s existence only\ndenied with genuine danger. But one needs, at least, a fairly complex\nstory about Hobbes\u2019s attitudes in order to sustain the view that\nhe was sneakily suggesting that God didn\u2019t exist.\n6. Reception\n\nHobbes was a widely read and controversial author. In many cases, the\ndiscussion of his philosophy was about his political philosophy\n(Goldie 1994, Malcolm 2002). However, Hobbes\u2019s non-political\nviews were also discussed. The Cambridge Platonist Ralph Cudworth, for\nexample, devoted considerable energy to arguing against Hobbesian\natheism and materialism. Cudworth\u2019s Cambridge colleague Henry\nMore was also a critic of Hobbes. Margaret Cavendish, meanwhile,\nreacted to Hobbes\u2019s work and developed her own non-Hobbesian\nmaterialism. \n\nOne important connection is that between Hobbes\u2019s work and\nLeibniz\u2019s. Of all the canonical philosophers in the period from\nDescartes to Kant, Leibniz is probably the one who paid most attention\nto Hobbes\u2019s work, and had the most to say about different\naspects of it. Leibniz found Hobbes\u2019s work worthy of serious\nengagement, but ultimately also thought it mistaken in many ways. On\nthe other hand, later empiricist philosophers, in particular Locke and\nHume, develop several Hobbesian themes. Indeed, one might well speak\nof Hobbes, not Locke, as the first of the British empiricists.\n\nThe best known parts of Leibniz\u2019s interaction with Hobbes are\nfrom early in Leibniz\u2019s philosophical career, before 1686, the\nyear in which Leibniz wrote his \u2018Discourse on Metaphysics\u2019\n(Bernstein 1980; Jesseph 1998; Moll 1996, 103\u201336; Wilson 1997).\nHis criticism of Hobbes\u2019s nominalism, and his early adoption of\nthe view that reasoning is computation, were both discussed above.\nLeibniz also paid a good deal of attention to Hobbes\u2019s views\nabout motion, in particular those about conatus or endeavour,\nwhich have application both to physics and to mathematics. And Leibniz\ntwice in the 1670s wrote letters to Hobbes, though it is unclear if\nHobbes ever received them, and there is no evidence of any replies.\nLeibniz continued, moreover, to engage with Hobbes\u2019s work\nthroughout his philosophical career, even if that engagement was never\nquite as intense as it was in a brief early period. There is, for\ninstance, a discussion of Hobbes\u2019s views in the 1709\nTheodicy.\n\nLooking beyond Leibniz, we can see some close connections between the\nwork of Hobbes and that of Locke and Hume, both of whom were well\naware of Hobbes\u2019s views. Locke\u2019s connections to Hobbes,\nthough perhaps not obvious, are there (Rogers 1988). Think of\nLocke\u2019s empiricism (i.e., anti-nativism), his attention to\nlanguage and its workings and related errors, his granting at least\nthe possibility of materialism being true, and his scepticism about\nrevelation. Hume, meanwhile, begins his Treatise with his\nview about ideas being less intense copies of our sensations, a view\nwith a close resemblance to Hobbes\u2019s view about decaying sense.\nRussell (1985; 2008) argues convincingly that Hume modelled the\nstructure of the Treatise on that of Hobbes\u2019s\nElements of Law. And Hume, like Hobbes, combines apparent\nacceptance of a basic cosmological argument with scepticism about many\nreligious claims. Indeed there are enough connections that it\u2019s\nplausible to speak of \u201cthe empiricism of Hobbes\u2026,\nLocke\u2026, and Hume\u201d (Nidditch 1975, viii), rather than of\nthe more conventional trio of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"Pri\">Primary Literature</a>", "<a name=\"Sec\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"Pri\">Primary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Aubrey, J., 1696, <em>Brief Lives</em>, in A.
