Epistemology I \u2014 Epistemic Terms, Principles, Foundationalism\n\nChisholm is perhaps best known for his work in epistemology. Though\nthe details of formulation steadily changed, Chisholm\u2019s\nfundamental position in epistemology remained constant. Chisholm took\nit as a starting point for his epistemological theorizing that we do\nhave knowledge of the external world. In addition, Chisholm accepted\nfurther anti-skeptical doctrines concerning knowledge by memory of the\npast, and a priori knowledge of some necessary truths. He did not\nassume that he could refute skepticism. Rather, he understood\nthe central project of epistemology to be the project of showing in\ndetail how it is possible for us to have quite a lot of the knowledge\nthat, in our reflective moments, we take ourselves to have. In\nadopting this stance, he seems to have been influenced by Moore as\nwell as some of his teachers at Brown and Harvard.\n\nPerhaps the most distinctive element of Chisholm\u2019s theory of\nknowledge is a set of tightly linked epistemic principles. These serve\nto display the relation between directly evident foundational\nknowledge and indirectly evident beliefs about the external world, the\npast, and other matters about which we can have knowledge. In his\ndoctoral dissertation, Chisholm made his earliest attempt to formulate\na set of such principles. [PPS] contains a more sophisticated system\nof principles. In the three editions of [TK] Chisholm presented even\nmore carefully worked out sets of proposed epistemic principles.\n\nWhen he stated these principles, Chisholm made use of several terms of\nepistemic appraisal. He appreciated the importance of explaining\nprecisely what each of these terms means. He also appreciated the\nimportance of explaining precisely how they are related. In an effort\nto explain all this, Chisholm started with a single primitive\nepistemic concept \u2014 this is the concept of greater\nreasonability, which relates the holding of one propositional\nattitude toward some proposition with the holding some other\npropositional attitude toward some proposition. In his discussion of\nthis concept, he pointed out that holding an attitude (belief, denial,\nwithholding) in one proposition could be more reasonable for a certain\nsubject than holding some attitude (belief, denial, withholding) in\nanother proposition. And then, making use of this fundamental\nepistemic concept (as well as the concepts of belief,\nrefraining and negation), Chisholm defined the concepts\nof certainty, being evident, being beyond\nreasonable doubt, being acceptable, and so on.\n\nIn [TK1] (22), Chisholm proposed these definitions of some central\nterms of epistemic appraisal:\n\n\np is reasonable for S at t\n=df believing p is more reasonable for\nS at t than withholding p.\n\np is acceptable for S at t\n=df withholding p is not more reasonable\nfor S at t than believing p.\n\np is evident for S at t\n=df (i) p is reasonable for S at\nt, and (ii) there is no proposition q such that it\nis more reasonable for S to believe q at t\nthan it is for S to believe p.\n\n\nChisholm maintained that there are logical relations among these\nconcepts. Thus, for example, he said that if something is evident,\nthen it is (at least) reasonable. A key necessary condition for\nknowing a proposition, according to Chisholm, was that the proposition\nbe evident. In some of his early works, Chisholm analyzed knowledge as\nevident true belief. In subsequent works he modified this in response\nto the Gettier problem.\n\nChapter 3 of [TK1] provides a good illustration of Chisholm\u2019s\nway of using these terms of epistemic appraisal in the statement of\nhis epistemic principles. In that chapter, he presents a set of nine\nepistemic principles. The first of these concerns\n\u201cself-presenting states\u201d. These are states such as belief,\nhope, fear and other propositional attitudes, as well as phenomenal\nstates of being appeared to in various ways, as well as states of\nintending or undertaking to do something. The principle is:\n\n(A) If there is a \u201cself-presenting state\u201d such that\nS is in that state, then it is evident to S\nthat he is in that state.\n\n\nPrinciple (A) would play a central role in a proposed explanation of\nthe possibility of a certain form of introspective knowledge. For\nexample, it would figure in an explanation of how it is possible for a\nperson to know that it now seems to him that he is seeing a doorknob.\nBy itself, (A) has no implications for knowledge of the external\nworld.\n\nSubsequent principles purport to explain further sorts of knowledge.\nPrinciple (B) says:\n\n(B) If S believes he perceives something to have a property\nF, then the proposition that he does perceive something to\nhave F, as well as the proposition that something has\nF is reasonable for S. ([TK1], 45)\n\n\n(B) applies only in cases in which S thinks he is seeing, or\nsmelling, or in some other way perceiving something to have\nF; it does not imply that in such conditions there actually\nis something that has F, or that it is evident to S\nthat there is something that has F. It implies merely that it\nis reasonable for S to believe this. Since\nreasonability is not a sufficiently strong epistemic condition for\nknowledge, this would not explain how knowledge of the external world\nis possible. But the next principle may seem to explain this.\n\n(C) If there is a sensible characteristic F such that\nS believes that he perceives something to have F,\nthen it is evident to S that he is perceiving\nsomething to have F, and that there is something that has\nF. ([TK1], 47)\n\n\nPrinciple (C) applies only in cases where F is a sensible\ncharacteristic. This would be a feature that is appropriate to one of\nthe senses, or a common sensible. But even when so restricted, (C)\nseems to be a very strong principle, for it seems to imply that some\nof our beliefs about objects in the external world are evident \u2014\nand this would be sufficient for knowledge according to the analysis\nof knowledge that Chisholm accepted at the time.\n\nHowever, on the next page Chisholm expresses some serious reservations\nabout (C). He mentions an analogy to statements of prima facie\nobligation. Such obligations can be overridden. These later remarks\nsuggest that Chisholm had intended (C) to be understood as a principle\nof merely prima facie evidence. Apparently, then, the real\nprinciple is:\n\n(C\u2032) If there is a sensible characteristic F such that\nS believes that he perceives something to have F,\nand this belief does not occur as part of some overriding wider\nsituation, then it is evident to S that he is\nperceiving something to have F, and that there is something\nthat has F.\n\n\nPrinciple (C\u2032) is considerably less bold than principle (C).\nThis can be seen if we reflect on what would count as a counterexample\nto (C). Consider a case in which a person knows perfectly well that he\nhas just taken some hallucinogenic drugs. Suppose he knows the typical\neffects of these drugs. Suppose he has good reason to believe that\nthere are no unicorns, but now he believes that he is perceiving\nsomething to be a unicorn.\n\nPrinciple (C) seems to imply that it is evident to him that there is a\nunicorn. Principle (C\u2032) does not have this implication. The fact\nthat the appearance occurs within this wider context defeats its prima\nfacie epistemic status. Although (C\u2032) is less bold than (C), it\ndoes help to explain how we can have knowledge of the sensible\ncharacteristics of external objects.\n\nThen come three principles about memory:\n\n\n(D) If S believes he remembers having perceived something to\nhave F, then the proposition that he does remember having\nperceived something to have F, as well as the proposition\nthat he did perceive that something had F, and the\nproposition that something was F, is acceptable for\nS.\n\n(E) If F is a sensible characteristic, and S\nbelieves he remembers having perceived something to have F,\nthen the proposition that he does remember having perceived something\nto have F, as well as the proposition that he did perceive\nthat something had F, and the proposition that something was\nF, is reasonable for S.\n\n(F) If there is a self presenting state P such that\nS believes he remembers having been in P, then the\nproposition that he remembers that he was in P, as well as\nthe proposition that he was in P, is one that is\nreasonable for S.\n\n\nNone of these principles would explain how we can have knowledge of\nthe past, for none of these principles implies that beliefs about the\npast can rise to the status of being evident \u2014 and\naccording to Chisholm a person can know a fact only if it is evident\nfor him.\n\nChisholm wanted to say that we can have knowledge of things beyond\nthose we \u201csee with our own eyes\u201d. These would include\nthings that are confirmed by the evidence of our senses. As a step\ntoward achieving this, he has a principle about such things. The\nprinciple makes use of the concept of the empirically\nacceptable. To find what\u2019s empirically acceptable for\nS, just consider all those propositions that get a rating of\nacceptable (or higher) by the aforementioned principles. Those are\nempirically acceptable for S at t. Chisholm does not\ndefine confirmation, but assumes we understand it.\n\n(G) If h is confirmed by the set of all things empirically\nacceptable for S at t, then h is\nacceptable for S at t. ([TK1], 53)\n\n\nBut note that this raises such things up to the level of acceptability\nonly. This is still not enough for knowledge.\n\nConsider a set of propositions that are logically consistent and\nindependent. No member is entailed by any combination of the others;\nno member is such that its negation is entailed by any combination of\nthe others. Suppose each member is confirmed by the combination of all\nthe others. Then that set is \u201cconcurrent\u201d.\n\n(H) If h is a member of a concurrent set of acceptable\npropositions for S at t, then h is\nreasonable for S at t.\n\n\nPrinciple (H) serves to raise the epistemic status of acceptable\npropositions. When they are members of concurrent sets, such\npropositions become reasonable. This is a coherentist element in\nChisholm\u2019s foundationalism in [TK1]. But it is still not quite\nsufficient for knowledge of the external world. For that, Chisholm\nfinally introduces:\n\n(I) If S believes at t that he perceives something to be\nF, and h is the proposition that there is\nsomething having the property F, and h is a member of a\nset of concurrent propositions each of which is acceptable for\nS, then h is evident to S at\nt.\n\n\nSo now we can see how, according to Chisholm at the time of [TK1],\nknowledge of the external world is possible. Let\u2019s take the\nproposition that there is a doorknob here. How can I know that?\nSuppose I am looking at, smelling, feeling, and remembering the\ndoorknob. Then via (B) lots of such propositions are reasonable for\nme. Suppose these all confirm the proposition, d, that there\nis a doorknob here. Then via (G), d is acceptable. Suppose\nall of these together with d form a concurrent set. Then via\n(H), d is reasonable. Suppose I think I am seeing the doorknob, and\nthe proposition that there is a doorknob is a member of a concurrent\nset of acceptable propositions. Then it is evident to me that there is\na doorknob here. If it\u2019s true, then I know it. If all these\nconditions are satisfied, I have knowledge of the external world.\n\nCritics may complain that this set of principles is incomplete and\nsketchy. (Indeed, in spite of the principles about memory, nothing in\nthis system even purports to explain how someone could have knowledge\nof the past.) Chisholm has given us no more than a sketch of a\npossible answer to the question of how empirical knowledge is\npossible. But it reveals the foundational, coherentist, Chisholmian\nepistemic principle-ist structure of his thought. All later variants\nretain these features. What is most distinctive about these principles\nis that they are not instances of more general logical principles and\nChisholm does not claim that they are true in virtue of any facts\nabout causal connections or reliability. They are presented as\nfundamental epistemological facts.\n",
