    "main_text": "Arguments for Dualism || The Aristotelian Argument in a Modern Form\n4.6 The Aristotelian Argument in a Modern Form\n\n\nPutting his anti-materialist argument outlined above, in section 1,\nin very general terms, Aristotle\u2019s worry was that a material organ\ncould not have the range and flexibility that are required for human\nthought. His worries concerned the cramping effect that matter would\nhave on the range of objects that intellect could accommodate.\nParallel modern concerns centre on the restriction that matter would\nimpose on the range of rational processes that we could\nexhibit. Some of these concerns are of a technical kind. G\u00f6del, for example, believed that his famous theorem showed that there are demonstrably rational forms of mathematical thought of which humans are capable which could not be exhibited by a mechanical\nor formal system of a sort that a physical mind would have to be. Penrose (1990) has argued that Turing\u2019s halting problem has similar consequences.But there are other less technical and easier to appreciate issues. I will mention four ways in which physicalist theories of thought seem vulnerable to attack by the dualist\n\n\n(a) At least since the time of Ryle\u2019s Concept of Mind (1949), it has been assumed that thinking can be handled in a dispositionalist way; so only sensations or \u2018raw feels\u2019 constitute a problem for the physicalist. There has been a rise or revival of a belief in what is now called cognitive phenomenology, that is, the belief that thoughts, of whatever kind \u2013 beliefs, desires, and the whole range of propositional attitude state \u2013 are conscious in a more than behavioural functional sense. This raises problems for physicalism, for, just as it is a problem that direct knowledge of \u2018what it is like\u2019 to experience your sensations is ultimately hidden from anyone else, so what you are thinking is directly accessible only privately, once it has been conceded that it has a phenomenology and not just a functional manifestation.\n\n\n(b) Anything purely physical operates solely according to physical laws operating on its physical properties: it does not, at bottom, operate according to meanings, senses, or propositional content. As a \u2018thinking machine\u2019, it is what Dennett (1987: 61) calls \u2018a syntactic engine\u2019, where \u2018syntax\u2019 is used, somewhat extendedly, to signify merely the physical structure of symbols and the consequent rules of their operation, rather than their meaning. The issue is whether, under this constraint, one can give an account for meaningful communication and understanding at all.\n\n\n(c) Physicalist theories of thought almost all focus on the model of\ncomputing, and when it comes to making problem solving (as opposed to\nsimply calculating) computers, computation comes across what is known\nas the Frame Problem. This is clearly expounded in Dennett\n(1984); see also the entry on\n the frame problem. \nThe problem is that the \u2018mechanical mind\u2019 can\nonly follow instructions, cannot see relevance that has not been\nstrictly encoded.This is often expressed by saying it lacks\n\u2018common sense\u2019.\n\n\n(d) There is what has become known as \u2018Benacerraf\u2019s Problem\u2019 (See his\n1983). Numbers, it would seem, are abstract objects, yet our\nintellects operate with them all the time. How does a physical brain\ninteract with an abstract entity? A similar problem could be raised\nfor concepts in general; they are abstract, general entities, not\nphysical particulars, yet they are the meat and drink of thinking. For\na dualist about intellect there does not appear to be the same\nproblem. The immaterial intellect is precisely the sort of thing that\ncan grasp abstract objects, such as numbers and universals \u2013 in the\nAristotelian context, the immaterial intellect is the home of\nforms. (There is still the issue of how this intellectual capacity of\nthe immaterial mind relates to sensory consciousness. According to\nAristotle, perception is a wholly embodied process, but for modern\ndualists, sensory consciousness is not material. In order to unify the\nperceptual and intellectual functions of the mind, traditional\nempiricists tended to be imagists, in their theory of thought, in\norder to assimilate the intellectual to the sensory, but this\nassimilation is rejected by those who believe in a distinct cognitive\nphenomenology, as mentioned in (a) above. The issue of how these two\nfunctions of mind are related in dualism is, it seems to me,\ninsufficiently investigated.)  The difficulty in accounting for the\nbrain\u2019s relation to abstract entities explains why most materialists\ntend to be nominalists,thus reducing thoughts to concrete particulars\nof some kind. (D. M. Armstrong in his (1978) is a striking exception\nto this, accepting an in re theory of universals.) But if you\ndo not find either nominalism or Armstrong\u2019s causal-functional theory\nof thinking convincing, Plato\u2019s idea in the Phaedo that the\nintellect must be such that it can have an affinity with immaterial\nthings begins to look very plausible.\n\n\n\nI will not discuss (a) further, as it is discussed in \nsection 5 of the \nentry on \n  phenomenal intentionality, \nAn immaterialist response to (d) can be found in Robinson (2011).\n\n\nBoth (b) and (c) seem to draw out the claim that a material system\n lacks understanding. John Searle\u2019s famous \u2018Chinese\n Room\u2019 argument (Searle 1980; see also the entry on\n  Chinese room argument) \nseems to support this conclusion, at least if the material system\ntakes the form of a classical computer, manipulating symbols according\nto rules. Searle imagines himself in a room with a letter box through\nwhich strings of symbols are posted in, and, following a book of\nrules, he puts out symbols which the rules dictate, given the strings\nhe is receiving. In fact, Searle says, he has been conducting a\nconversation in Chinese, because the symbols are Chinese script, and\nthe rules those on which a Chinese computer might work, but he has not\nunderstood a word. Therefore neither does a computer understand, so\nwe, understanding creatures, are not computers. If Searle is right,\nthis is the end for the classical \u2018syntactic engine\u2019 as a\nmodel for thought.\n\n\nA blow was struck against the computational theory of thought when, in\n2000, Fodor produced his The Mind Does Not Work That Way, in\nwhich he made clear his belief that the kind of computationalism that\nhe had been describing and developing ever since the 1970s only fits\nsub-personal informational processing, not conscious, problem solving\nthought. I say that he \u2018made this clear\u2019, because he had\nalways mentioned this reservation, but his claim that what he was\ndescribing was \u2018the Language of Thought\u2019 led his readers\ngenerally to take him to be proposing an account of what we normally\nconsider to be thinking, which is not restricted (even if it includes\nat all) sub-personal processes. The modest view it is entirely in line\nwith his close colleague Chomsky\u2019s claim that his\n\u2013 Chomsky\u2019s \u2013 linguistic theories cannot touch the \u2018creative\nuse of language\u2019(See Baker, 2011).\n\n\nOne physicalist response to these challenges is to say that they apply\nonly to the classical computing model, and are avoided by\nconnectionist theories. Classical computing works on rules of\ninference like those of standard logic, but connectionism is rather a\nform of associationism, which is supposedly closer to the way in which\nthe brain works.(See the entry on Connectionism.) The latest version\nof this \u2013 \u2018Deep Learning\u2019 \u2013 is very good at\nface recognition and, in general, pattern recognition, including those\ninvolved in the playing of games like chess and Go. But Gary Marcus\n(2018 \u2013 see Other Internet Resources) and others have pointed\nout the ways in which these impressive machines are quite different\nfrom human thought. Marcus points to ten significant differences, but\nthe two most easy to capture briefly are (i) \u2018deep\nlearning\u2019 is data hungry. We can learn things with very few\ntrials because we latch on to abstract relationships, whereas the\nmachine requires many \u2013 perhaps thousands or millions \u2013 of\nexamples to try to catch extensionally what we get by the abstract or\nintensional relation. (ii) Deep learning is shallow and has a limited\ncapacity for transfer of what it has learnt from one context to\nanother, even though the differences look trivial to us.  It seems\nthat collecting examples cannot itself constitute \u2018getting the\npoint\u2019, though it might manage to mimic it, if the circumstances\nare carefully managed.\n\n\nThe dualist might sum up the situation on thought in the following way. The case against physicalist theories of sensation is that it is unbelievable that what it feels like to be struck hard on the nose is itself either just a case of being disposed or caused to engage in certain behaviours, or that what it feels like is not fundamental to the way you do react. Similarly, the dualist about thought will say, when you are, for example, engaged in a philosophical discussion, and you make a response to your interlocutor, it is obvious that you are intending to respond to what you thought he or she meant and are concentrating on what what you intend to say means. It seems as bizarre to say that this is a bye-product of processes to which meaning is irrelevant, as it is to claim the same about sensory consciousness. You are, in other words, as fundamentally a semantically driven engine, as you are a sensorily consciously driven one. Perhaps, in the case of a sophisticated conversation, the fundamentality of meaning, and of conscious reflection, as a driver is even more obvious than in the case of sensation\n\n\nA dualist could, it seems, argue that Plato was right in claiming that intellect necessarily has an affinity with the realm of abstract entities, and Aristotle was right to think that no material or mechanical system could capture the flexibility built into genuine understanding. We all have our limitations, but there is no specific point, following directly from what we are made of, or how we are \u2018programmed\u2019 which constitutes an absolute barrier.\n",
