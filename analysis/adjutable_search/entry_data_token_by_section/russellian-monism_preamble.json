    "main_text": "\n\nRussellian monism is a theory in the metaphysics of mind, on which a\nsingle set of properties underlies both consciousness and the most\nbasic entities posited by physics. The theory is named for Bertrand\nRussell, whose views about consciousness and its place in nature were\ninformed by a structuralist conception of theoretical physics. On such\na structuralist conception, physics describes the world in terms of\nits spatiotemporal structure and dynamics (changes within that\nstructure) and says nothing about what, if anything, underlies that\nstructure and dynamics. For example, as it is sometimes put, physics\ndescribes what mass and charge do, e.g., how they dispose\nobjects to move toward or away from each other, but not what mass and\ncharge are. Thus, Russell writes the following about the\nevents physics describes:\n\n\nAll that physics gives us is certain equations giving abstract\nproperties of their changes. But as to what it is that changes, and\nwhat it changes from and to\u2014as to this, physics is silent.\n(Russell 1959: 18)\n\n\nRussellian monism can be seen as breaking that silence. It posits\nproperties that underlie the structure and dynamics that physics\ndescribes. Further, according to Russellian monism, those same\nproperties are relevant to, and may at least partly constitute,\nconsciousness.\n",
