Conclusion\n\n\nThe law\u2019s task, put abstractly, is to secure a situation whereby\nmoral goals which, given the current social situation in the country\nwhose law it is, would be unlikely to be achieved without it, and\nwhose achievement by the law is not counter-productive, are realized.\n(Raz 2003 [2009: 178])\n\n\nThis remark could be taken as the essence of legal moralism. The basic\ncore of legal moralism, as we have seen, is a two-part structure,\ncompounded of a wrong and a set of countervailing and potentially\ndefeating factors, such as liberty and privacy. From within legal\nmoralism there are controversies over how morality should itself be\nconceived and controversies over how the first part of the structure\nshould be conceived\u2014all moral wrongs or only a subset of\nthem?\u2014and the second part\u2014which countervailing factors,\nfor example, make the list? And what, if anything, unifies them? While\nRaz\u2019s remark may serve as a pithy statement of legal moralism,\nRaz himself rejected legal moralism, in favour of a version of the\nharm principle. Mill\u2019s original harm principle was based on a\nmonistic utilitarianism. There remain adherents of such a\nutilitarianism, but more influential today is some version of\nvalue-pluralism, such as Raz\u2019s liberal perfectionism. The\nderivation of the harm principle from such pluralistic premises, is as\nwe have seen, a far from straightforward task. Adherents of the harm\nprinciple also manifest a strong divide between those who broadly\ninherit Mill\u2019s principled anti-moralism without his\nanti-paternalism, such as Hart and Raz and those who inherit both\nMill\u2019s principled anti-moralism and his anti-paternalism, such\nas Feinberg. Into the mix comes Rawlsian public reason. Like one kind\nof legal moralist, there is an emphasis on steering the justification\nof legal coercion to the citizens subject to the coercion themselves\nand from this an aspiration to develop a \u201cmodule\u201d of\npolitical practical reasoning, the public reason of all subjects of a\ngiven legal system independent of the comprehensive ethical or\nreligious commitments of some of their number. For the proponent of\npublic reason it is the \u201czeal to embody the whole truth\u201d\nthat is anathema (Rawls 1999: 132\u2013133). To legal moralists such\nas Moore, the moral truth, with due sensitivity to the countervailing\nfactors, should rather be the point. The idea that the law has\nsometimes no limits to hold back the moral truth\u2014which of\nnecessity must lie in the mouth of some (fallible) human\u2014can\ninduce a feeling of vertigo. Perhaps the question ultimately turns on\nwhether there is a genuine alternative.\n",
