    "main_text": "New approaches to ability\n5. New approaches to ability\n\nThe foregoing has indicated serious concerns about the adequacy of the\northodox approaches to ability and its ascription: the conditional\nanalysis (CA), and the modal analysis (MA), of which (CA) is arguably\njust a special case. This raises the question of what a\nnon-hypothetical and non-modal account of ability and its ascription\nmight look like.\n\nSince abilities are, as noted in Section 1.1, a kind of power, one\nnatural idea is to analyze abilities in terms of some other kind of\npower. This appeal may proceed in different ways. One is by appealing\nto dispositions, and by analyzing abilities in terms of this\npurportedly better-understood kind of power. Another is by departing\nmore radically from the standard ontology of recent metaphysics, and\nanalyzing ability in terms of some new and distinctive variety of\npower. We will consider these approaches in turn in Sections 5.1 and\n5.2. Finally, in Section 5.3, we will turn to miscellaneous\nalternative approaches to ability, which reject the conditional and\nmodal analyses, but which do not purport to analyze abilities in terms\nof powers either.\n",
