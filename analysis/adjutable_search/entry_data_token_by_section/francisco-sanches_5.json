Sanches\u2019 Empiricist Scepticism\n\nOne topic of debate regarding Sanches\u2019 scepticism revolves\naround the question of whether he was an Academic sceptic like\nCarneades with whom he identified himself in his letter to Clavius\n (\u00a72.2)\n or whether his scepticism was of the Pyrrhonian variety as Pierre\nBayle (1647\u20131706) claimed it to be in his Dictionary entry on\nSanches (1697 [1820: 76]). However, the distinction between Pyrrhonian\nand Academic scepticism has not always been clear (cf. Striker 1996:\n140\u2013141, 148\u2013149). For Popkin (1964), Sanches\u2019\nscepticism unlike\n Pyrrho\u2019s\n (c. 360 BCE\u2013c. 270 BCE) or\n Sextus Empiricus\u2019\n (c. 160 CE\u2013c. 210 CE), does not call for the suspension of\njudgment \u201cbut rather the more full-fledged negative dogmatism of\nthe Academics\u201d (Popkin 1964: 41). Popkin continues: \n\n\nThe Pyrrhonists, with their more thoroughgoing scepticism, could\nneither assent to the positive theory of knowledge, nor to the\ndefinite conclusion that nihil scitur. (Popkin 1964: 42) \n\n\nBut this characterization of Sanches\u2019 \u201cnihil\nscitur\u201d does not seem completely correct either, for it did\nnot mean, as previously suggested, that absolutely nothing was known.\nInstead Sanches presented it as a diagnosis, pertinent on the one\nhand, to the medical treatment of the body and on the other, to\nphilosophical inquiry concerning the things (rerum) that\ncould indeed be known with some degree of certainty (Lupoli 2009).\nNow, while Limbrick, like Popkin, also views Sanches as an Academic\nsceptic, she, on the other hand emphasizes the notion of Carneadean\nprobabilism and its connection to Sanches\u2019 \u201cmedical\npractice\u201d (1988: 79). To the point, it is not clear that Sanches\nhad any direct knowledge of Sextus Empiricus\u2019 work; what is\nevident, nevertheless, is that he was familiar with Galen\u2019s\nwork, which seems to have influenced his own empiricist\nscepticism.\n\nAdmittedly, pairing Sanches with Galen may at first seem rather odd,\ngiven the latter\u2019s rejection of scepticism. In \u201cMy Own\nBooks\u201d he wrote that he wished to learn \u201cthe science of\nlogical proof\u201d (GAL2: 18) and the method by which to recognize\nwhether a particular proof was sound or not. To accomplish such, he\nsays, he turned to \u201cthe best-reputed Stoic and Peripatetic\nphilosophers of the time\u201d (GAL2: 18), but their conflicting\nlogical theories culminated in confusion. \n\n\nIndeed, as far as these teachers were concerned, I might well have\nfallen into a Pyrrhonian despair of knowledge, if I had not had a firm\ngrip of the disciplines of geometry, mathematics, and\narithmetic\u2026. (GAL2: 18) \n\n\nAnd yet while Galen divided the different approaches to knowledge into\nroughly that of the Rationalists (or Dogmatists), the Empiricists, and\nthe Methodics, his scientific method was a mix of each one of them,\nemphasizing a marriage between theory and empiricism. In his\nintroduction to Galen: Selected Works, P. N. Singer writes:\n\n\n\nThe Empiric school, which was founded in the mid-third century BC by a\nfollower of Herophilus [335 BC\u2013280 BC], was influenced by\nSceptical philosophy, and represented an attempt to engage in the art\nof medicine with as little as possible in the way of theoretical\npostulates. (Singer 1997: xiv) \n\n\nThis almost seems as a corollary to Sanches\u2019 sceptical rejection\nof the theoretical, dogmatic postulates of the Aristotelian syllogism\nand Plato\u2019s Ideas. \n\n\nDenying the possibility of true knowledge concerning the body, the\nEmpiric\u2019s view is that the doctor must rely on experience\n(peira) and precise observation\n(t\u0113r\u0113sis)\u2026. (1997: xiv) \n\n\nIn that light, if indeed it was the mathematical disciplines that\nsaved Galen from falling into a Pyrrhonian despair concerning\nknowledge, it is because his vision of mathematics seems to have had\nthe function of proving along with experience (or experimentation)\ntheories necessary to arrive at correct diagnoses, and not because he\nenvisioned mathematics as an abstract, Platonic discipline.\n\nThus, what prima facie seems to be a major difference between\nGalen and Sanches regarding the truths mathematics may not be so great\nafter all. Doubtlessly, Galen was an Aristotelian philosopher and\nphysician, who subscribed to Aristotelian logic and definitions,\nwhereas Sanches was not and did not; and yet much like Sanches he\ndoubted that any knowledge of the noumenal world (e.g., God,\nthe substance and immortality of the soul, etc.) was possible.\nInterestingly, Galen\u2019s \u201cAn Outline of Empiricism\u201d\nbegins with the following sentence: \n\n\nAll doctors who are followers of experience, just like the\nphilosophers who are called Sceptics, refuse to be called after a man,\nbut rather want to be known by their frame of mind. (GAL1: 23) \n\n\nSuch a statement bears resemblance to Sanches\u2019 questioning of\nuniversals for the very much the same reason; that is to say, because\nthe experience of things (rerum) is always the experience of\nparticulars and not of universals (like Man). Galen later explains:\n\n\n\nWe say that the art of medicine has taken its origin from experience,\nand not from indication. By \u201cexperience\u201d, we mean the\nknowledge of something which is based on one\u2019s own perception,\nby \u201cindication\u201d, the knowledge which is based on rational\nconsequence. For perception leads us to experience, whereas reason\nleads the dogmatics to indication. (GAL1: 24) \n\n\nEarlier empiricists, argues Galen, viewed perception and experience as\nboth the activity of seeing for oneself (autopsia) and as\ncognition, and that is how he thought medical practice ought to be\nconducted (GAL1: 25\u201326). Here we have Galen the physician and\nthe philosopher who wrote: \u201cThe best doctor is also a\nphilosopher\u201d (GAL2: 30\u201334), and the Galen who was to be a\npredecessor of Sanches. But Galen was not alone in being a philosopher\nand a physician. His contemporary Sextus Empiricus seems also to have\nbeen both.\n\nIn section XXXIV of Outlines of Scepticism, Sextus Empiricus\nposed the question \u201cIs medical empiricism the same as\nscepticism?\u201d (SE-OS: 62: 235), to which he answered that if\nempiricism made assertions about \u201cthe inapprenhensibility of\nunclear matters\u201d then it could not be the same as scepticism,\nand the same applied to scepticism, for scepticism was precisely a\nrejection of belief in things that could not be proven (dogmatism).\nNowhere else did these two modes of thought function better, wrote\nSextus Empiricus, than in medicine. He argued:\n\n\nThey might rather adopt, as it seems to me, what is called the Method,\nfor this alone of the medical schools seem to practice no rashness in\nunclear matters and does not presume to say whether they are\napprehensible or inapprehensible, but it follows what is apparent,\ntaking thence, in line with Sceptical practice, what seems to be\nexpedient. (SE-OS: 63: 236\u2013237).\n\n\nMedicine, then, for Sextus Empiricus was what medicine would equally\nbe for the late sixteenth century Sanches: a combination of empiricism\nand scepticism. Medicine took as much from philosophical scepticism,\nas philosophical empiricism took from medicine. Galen\u2019s above\ncritique of \u201cindications\u201d or indicans (cf.\nMaclean 2002: 308\u2013310)\u2014which bears a certain similarity to\nSanches\u2019 critique of demonstration and naming\u2014is best\nexplained by Sextus Empiricus:\n\n\nA sign is indicative, they say, if it signifies that of which it is a\nsign not by having been observed evidently together with the thing it\nsignifies but from its proper nature and constitution (as bodily\nmovements are signs of the soul). That is why they also define this\nsign as follows: An indicative sign is a pre-antecedent statement in a\nsound conditional, revelatory of the consequent. There being two\ndifferent sorts of signs\u2026we argue not against all signs but\nonly against indicative signs, which seem to be a fiction of the\nDogmatists. For recollective signs are found convincing by everyday\nlife: seeing smoke, someone diagnoses fire, having observed a scar, he\nsays that a wound was inflicted. (SE-OS: 93: 101, 102)\n\n\nTo put it Sanchean terms, indicative signs are helpful when they\nrefer to particular things (rerum) in the world; and\nthey are unhelpful when they refer to the dogmatic notion of\nuniversals. Just as Carmen de Cometa/Poem of the Comet was\nwritten to dispel the notion of comets as signs of bad things to come,\nDe divinatione per somnum, ad Aristotelem, rejects the idea\nthat any knowledge can be attained by way of demonic states,\nprophecies, or dreams. In John Owen\u2019s quirky but insightful\nbook, The Skeptics of the French Renaissance, one of the\ncharacters of the dialogue says at the very beginning of the chapter\non Sanches that \n\n\n[i]n an age when science and medicine was mixed up with astrology,\ndivination, charms, and an enormous farrago of superstitious nonsense,\nSanchez held up to his brother physicians the torch of a true Science\nfounded upon experiment, and a due recognition of natural laws. (1893:\n617) \n\n\nThis is obviously significant for its recognition of the importance of\nthe scientific method in Sanches\u2019 elaboration of his scepticism.\nHere both Damian Caluori and Limbrick agree that Sanches\u2019s\ncritique of Aristotelianism and his proposed scepticism was \u201cnot\nonly of theoretical concern\u201d (Caluori 2007: 45), but a practical\none that sought \u201cthe answer to the question of the right\nscientific method to be used in the quest for true knowledge\u201d\n(Limbrick 1988: 25). And while Caluori argues that his empiricist\nscepticism was Pyrrhonian in nature, what is clear for both Caluori\nand Limbrick is that his scepticism was by no means absolute, and that\nfundamental to his rejection of Aristotelianism was his medical\ntraining where particular things needed to be perceived and analyzed\nnot by their names or definitions but rather by the external qualities\nthat they presented to the senses, since such practical matters as\ndiagnoses needed to be made, and cures needed to be prescribed and\nadministered. In comparison to the treatment of the body, such a thing\nas the content of his mind would have seemed much less important to\nSanches.\n",
