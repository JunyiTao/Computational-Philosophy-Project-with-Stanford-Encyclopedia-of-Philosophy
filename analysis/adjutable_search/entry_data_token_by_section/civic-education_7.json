    "main_text": "The Good Democrat || The State, Parents, and Children in Liberal Democracies\n2.1 The State, Parents, and Children in Liberal Democracies\n\nSeveral contemporary philosophers argue that citizens have a\nrelatively demanding role and that they can and should be educated for\nit. Gutmann (1987), for example, argues that democratic\nsociety-at-large has a significant stake in the education of its\nchildren, for they will grow up to be democratic citizens. At the very\nleast, then, society has the responsibility for educating all children\nfor citizenship. Because democratic societies have this\nresponsibility, we cannot leave the education of future citizens to\nthe will or whim of parents. This central insight leads Gutmann to\nrule out certain exclusive suzerainties of power over educational\ntheory and policy. Those suzerainties are of three sorts. First is\n\u201cthe family state\u201d in which all children are educated into\nthe sole good life identified and fortified by the state. Such\neducation cultivates \u201ca level of like-mindedness and camaraderie\namong citizens\u201d that most persons find only in families (Ibid,\n23).  Only the state can be entrusted with the authority to mandate\nand carry out an education of such magnitude that all will learn to\ndesire this one particular good life over all others.\n\nNext is \u201cthe state of families\u201d that rests on the impulse\nof families to perpetuate their values through their children. This\nstate \u201cplaces educational authority exclusively in the hands of\nparents, thereby permitting parents to predispose their children,\nthrough education, to choose a way of life consistent with their\nfamilial heritage\u201d (Ibid, 28).\n\nFinally, Gutmann argues against \u201cthe state of\nindividuals,\u201d which is based on a notion of liberal neutrality\nin which both parents and the state look to educational experts to\nmake certain that no way of life is neglected nor discriminated\nagainst. The desire here is to avoid controversy, and to avoid\nteaching virtues, in a climate of social pluralism. Yet, as Gutmann\npoints out, any educational policy is itself a choice that will shape\nour children\u2019s character. Choosing to educate for freedom rather\nthan for virtue is still insinuating an influential choice.\n\nIn light of these three theories that fail to provide an adequate\nfoundation for educational authority, Gutmann proposes \u201ca\ndemocratic state of education.\u201d This state recognizes that\neducational authority must be shared among parents, citizens, and\neducational professionals, because each has a legitimate interest in\neach child and the child\u2019s future. Whatever our aim of\neducation, whatever kind of education these authorities argue for, it\nwill not be, it cannot be, neutral. Needed is an educational aim that\nis inclusive. Gutmann settles on our inclusive commitment as\ndemocratic citizens to conscious social reproduction, the\nself-conscious shaping of the structures of society. To actuate this\ncommitment we as a society \u201cmust educate all educable children\nto be capable of participating in collectively shaping their\nsociety\u201d (Ibid, 14).\n\nTo shape the structures of society, to engage in conscious social\nreproduction, students will need to develop the capacities for\nexamining and evaluating competing conceptions of the good life and\nthe good society, and society must avoid the inculcation \u201cin\nchildren [of the] uncritical acceptance of any particular way or ways\nof [personal and political] life\u201d (Ibid, 44). This is the crux\nof Gutmann\u2019s democratic education. For this reason, she argues\nforcefully that children must learn to exercise critical deliberation\namong good lives and, presumably, good societies. To assure that they\ncan do so, limits must be set for when and where parents and the state\ncan interfere. Guidelines must be introduced that limit the political\nauthority of the state and the parental authority of families. One\nlimit is nonrepression, which assures that neither the state nor any\ngroup within it can \u201crestrict rational deliberation of competing\nconceptions of the good life and the good society\u201d (Idem). In\nthis way, adults cannot use their freedom to deliberate to prohibit\nthe future deliberative freedom of children. Furthermore, claims\nGutmann, nonrepression requires schools to support \u201cthe\nintellectual and emotional preconditions for democratic deliberation\namong future generations of citizens\u201d (Ibid, 76.)\n\nThe second limit is nondiscrimination, which prevents the state or\ngroups within the state from excluding anyone or any group from an\neducation in deliberation. Thus, as Gutmann says, \u201call educable\nchildren must be educated\u201d (Ibid, 45).\n\nGutmann\u2019s point is not that the state has a greater interest\nthan parents in the education of our children. Instead, her point is\nthat all citizens of the state have a common interest in educating\nfuture citizens. Therefore, while parents should have a say in the\neducation of their children, the state should have a say as well. Yet\nneither should have the final, or a monopolistic, say. Indeed, these\ntwo interested parties should also cede some of their educational\nauthority to educational experts. There is, therefore, a collective\ninterest in schooling, which is why Gutmann finds parental\n\u201cchoice\u201d and voucher programs unacceptable.\n\nBut is conscious social reproduction the only aim of education? What\nabout shaping one\u2019s private concerns? Isn\u2019t educating the\nyoung to be good persons also important? Or are the skills that\nencourage citizen participation also the skills necessary for making\npersonal life choices and personal decision-making? For Gutmann,\neducating for one is also educating for the other:\n\u201c\u2026[M]any if not all of the capacities necessary for\nchoice among good lives are also necessary for choice among good\nsocieties\u201d (p. 40). She goes even further: \u201ca good life\nand a good society for self-reflective people require (respectively)\nindividual and collective freedom of choice\u201d (Idem). Here\nGutmann is stipulating that to have conscious social reproduction\ncitizens must have the opportunity\u2014the freedom and the\ncapacities\u2014to exercise personal or self-reflective choice.\n\nBecause the state is interested in the education of future citizens,\nall children must develop those capacities necessary for choice among\ngood societies; this is simply what Gutmann means by being able to\nparticipate in conscious social reproduction. Yet such capacities also\nenable persons to scrutinize the ways of life that they have\ninherited. Thus, Gutmann concludes, it is illegitimate for any parent\nto impose a particular way of life on anyone else, even on his/her own\nchild, for this would deprive the child of the capacities necessary\nfor citizenship as well as for choosing a good life.\n\nGutmann\u2019s position is that government can and must force one to\nparticipate in an education for citizenship. Children must be exposed\nto ways of life different from their parents\u2019 and must embrace\ncertain values such as mutual respect. On this last point Gutmann is\ninsistent. She argues that choice is not meaningful, for anyone,\nunless persons choosing have \u201cthe intellectual skills necessary\nto evaluate ways of life different from that of their parents.\u201d\nWithout the teaching of such skills as a central component of\neducation children will not be taught \u201cmutual respect among\npersons\u201d (Ibid, 30\u201331). \u201cTeaching mutual respect is\ninstrumental to assuring all children the freedom to choose in the\nfuture\u2026[S]ocial diversity enriches our lives by expanding our\nunderstanding of differing ways of life. To reap the benefits of\nsocial diversity, children must be exposed to ways of life different\nfrom their parents and\u2014in the course of their\nexposure\u2014must embrace certain values, such as mutual respect\namong persons\u2026\u201d (Ibid, 32\u201333).\n\nYet what Gutmann suggests seems to go beyond seeing diversity as\nenrichment. She suggests that children not simply tolerate ways of\nlife divergent from their own, but that they actually respect them.\nShe is careful to say \u201cmutual respect among persons,\u201d\nwhich can only mean that neo-Nazis, while advocating an execrable way\nof life, must be respected as persons, though their way of life should\nbe condemned. Perhaps this is a subtlety that Gutmann intended, but\nWilliam Galston, for one, has come away thinking that Gutmann\nadvocates forcing children to confront their own ways of life as they\nsimultaneously show respect for neo-Nazis.\n\nIn our representative system, argues Galston, citizens need to develop\n\u201cthe capacity to evaluate the talents, character, and\nperformance of public officials\u201d (1989, p. 93). This, he says,\nis what our democratic system demands from citizens. Thus he disagrees\nwith Gutmann, so much so that he says, \u201cIt is at best a partial\ntruth to characterize the United States as a democracy in\nGutmann\u2019s sense\u201d (Ibid, p. 94). We do not require\ndeliberation among our citizens, says Galston, because\n\u201crepresentative institutions replace direct self-government for\nmany purposes\u201d (Idem). Civic education, therefore, should not be\nabout teaching the skills and virtues of deliberation, but, instead,\nabout teaching \u201cthe virtues and competences needed to select\nrepresentatives wisely, to relate to them appropriately, and to\nevaluate their performance in office soberly\u201d (Idem).\n\nBecause civic education is limited in scope to what Galston outlines\nabove, students will not be expected, and will not be taught, to\nevaluate their own ways of life. Persons must be able to lead the\nkinds of lives they find valuable, without fear that they will be\ncoerced into believing or acting or thinking contrary to their values,\nincluding being led to question those ways of life that they have\ninherited. As Galston points out, \u201c[c]ivic tolerance of deep\ndifferences is perfectly compatible with unswerving belief in the\ncorrectness of one\u2019s own way of life\u201d (Ibid, p. 99).\n\nSome parents, for example, are not interested in having their children\nchoose ways of life. Those parents believe that the way of life that\nthey currently follow is not simply best for them but is best\nsimpliciter. To introduce choice is simply to confuse the\nchildren and the issue. If you know the true way to live, is it best\nto let your children wade among diverse ways of life until they can\npossibly get it right? Or should you socialize the children into the\nright way of life as soon and as quickly as possible?\n\nYet what about the obligations that parents, as citizens, and children\nas future citizens, owe the state? How can children be prepared to\nparticipate in collectively shaping society if they have not received\nan education in how to deliberate about choices? To this some parents\nmight respond that they are not interested in having their children\nfocus on participation, or perhaps on anything secular. What these\nparents appreciate about liberal democracy is that there is a clear,\nand firm, separation between public and private, and they seek to\nfocus exclusively on the private. Citizenship offers protections of\nthe law, and it does not require participation. Liberal democracy\ncertainly will not force one to participate.\n\nYet both Galston and Gutmann want to educate children for\n\u201cdemocratic character.\u201d Both see the need in this respect\nfor critical thinking. For Galston children must develop \u201cthe\ncapacity to evaluate the talents, character, and performance of public\nofficials\u201d; Gutmann seeks to educate the capacities necessary\nfor choice among good lives and for choice among good societies.\nHowever much critical thinking plays in democratic character, active\nparticipation requires something more than mere skills, even thinking\nskills.\n\nYet both Galston and Gutmann want to educate children for\n\u201cdemocratic character.\u201d Both see the need in this respect\nfor critical thinking.
