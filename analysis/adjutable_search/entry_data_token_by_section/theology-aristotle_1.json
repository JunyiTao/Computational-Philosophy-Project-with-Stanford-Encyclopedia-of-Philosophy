    "main_text": "Historical questions\n2. Historical questions\nThe most thorough inquiry into the provenance and history of the texts is to be found in Zimmermann 1986, and his major conclusions have been accepted in most subsequent work on the Theology. Yet much remains a matter of doubt and speculation.\nOne thing that seems certain is that the Arabic version was produced in the circle of al-Kindi, a ninth century philosopher who guided the work of several translators. Endress 1973, in a groundbreaking study, showed that the Arabic Plotinus materials can be grouped linguistically and thematically with other works produced by this circle (see further below, \u00a73). Furthermore, there is the evidence of the preface of the Theology itself. The preface begins:\nThe first chapter of the book of Aristotle the philosopher, called in Greek \u2018Theologia\u2019, that is, \u2018discourse on divinity\u2019. The exposition of Porphyry of Syria, translated into Arabic by Ibn Na\u2018ima al-Himsi, and corrected for Ahmad ibn al-Mu\u2018tasim by al-Kindi. [Note: the Arabic names have been shortened for clarity.]\nAhmad ibn al-Mu\u2018tasim is the son of the \u2018Abbasid caliph who reigned from 833\u2013842 AD, so this gives us a fairly reliable date for the production of the Theology, or at least for al-Kindi\u2019s \u2018correction\u2019 of it. This date may in fact apply to the whole original Arabic translation of Plotinus. It is worth noting that this makes the Greek exemplar on which the translation was based earlier than our oldest Greek manuscripts of the Enneads. In fact we know that the Greek basis of the Arabic version represented an independent branch of the tradition, since all our Greek manuscripts lack a section (at Enn. IV.7.8) from the Enneads that is transmitted indirectly by Eusebius, but is found in the Arabic translation (in chapter three of the Theology).\nWe know of Ibn Na\u2018ima al-Himsi from other sources, too: he was a translator of the Kindi circle, and also rendered Aristotle (the Sophistical Refutations and parts of the Physics) into Arabic. Al-Himsi, like many translators of the period, was a Syrian Christian. This raises the question of whether he translated directly from Greek or from an intermediary Syriac version, which was a common practice in the Arabic translation movement. Zimmermann argues that there is no need to postulate a Syriac intermediary, though this has been questioned more recently (Bucur and Bucur 2006, but against postulating a Syriac intermediary Brock 2007).\nMore provocative is the mention of Porphyry. He was a student of Plotinus and edited the latter\u2019s works into the six groupings of nine that are known as the Enneads. We know that the Theology depends on this edition, because it preserves breaks imposed by Porphyry as he split up longer treatises in order to get the number of Plotinian works up to 54. So when the preface suggests that we are dealing with a commentary or \u2018exposition\u2019 of the Enneads by Porphyry, this might just refer to the fact that the original Arabic version was based on his edition. But since Porphyry tells us himself that he wrote comments on Plotinus, some have wished to see in the Arabic Plotinus a translation of a work by Porphyry, which would be a reworking of his master\u2019s thought even more closely based on the text of the Enneads than Porphyry\u2019s extant Sentences. If this is right, the aforementioned paraphrasing and philosophical additions would be an important body of evidence for Porphyry\u2019s thought and his understanding of the thought of his teacher, Plotinus. However, this Porphyrian hypothesis was rejected by Zimmermann, and in this he has again been followed by later scholarship. It may however be that the so-called \u2018headings\u2019 do stem from Porphyry. It has been noted that these show a familiarity with Plotinus\u2019 system that would fit with Porphyrian authorship, and that there is philosophical and philological evidence to suggest that Porphyry\u2019s lost index of main points in the Enneads could well stand behind this element of the Arabic Plotinus (D\u2019Ancona 2012a, Chase 2021).\nSuppose then that the Arabic Plotinus is based directly on the Greek of the Enneads, and not a Syriac version or a Greek paraphrase by Porphyry or anyone else. This would leave us with the simpler hypothesis that al-Kindi\u2019s circle itself was responsible for the re-working of the Enneads. But even here, a question could be raised: which member of al-Kindi\u2019s circle is to be credited with transforming Plotinian thought in this fashion? One might further wonder whether the rather chaotic order of the passages in the Theology and Letter on Divine Science is merely the result of textual catastrophe (with loose sections stitched back together to form the chapters of the Theology), or also preserves some deliberate re-ordering of the text. Both of these issues are matters of dispute. Thus Zimmermann 1986 and Adamson 2002 think that al-Himsi is primarily responsible for the text, with al-Kindi having contributed relatively little; D\u2019Ancona 1995, 2001 has suggested that al-Kindi may have played a larger role. However Adamson and D\u2019Ancona, but not Zimmermann, believe that there may have been deliberate selection and re-ordering of the text at an early stage. One reason to suspect this is that the individual chapters do seem to have internal thematic unity, though the order of chapters does not match the order of topics set out in the preface (D\u2019Ancona 2011a).\nFinally, and most famously, there is the preface\u2019s claim that the work before us is \u2018the book of Aristotle.\u2019 While it is sometimes suggested that this misattribution was intentional\u2014an attempt to win wider readership for the work or to give it authority under false pretences\u2014Zimmermann hypothesized that it is just a later, ill-informed addition, based on a misunderstanding of the rest of the preface. After providing the information quoted above, the preface goes on to suggest how the Theology could be integrated into Aristotelian philosophy. Essentially, the preface gives us to understand that the Theology will say more about God and His relation to the world, and about the immaterial soul, than is divulged by Aristotle himself. On this plausible account, the Kindi circle saw Plotinus\u2019 thought as compatible with, and even completing, Aristotle\u2019s thought; but they did not actually think it was by Aristotle.\n",
