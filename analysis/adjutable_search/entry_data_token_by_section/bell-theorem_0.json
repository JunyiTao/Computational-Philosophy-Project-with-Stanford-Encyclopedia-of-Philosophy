    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIn 1964 John S. Bell, a native of Northern Ireland and a staff member\nof CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research) whose primary\nresearch concerned theoretical high energy physics, published a paper\n(Bell 1964) in the short-lived journal Physics, which\neventually transformed the study of the foundation of quantum\nmechanics. \n\nThe paper showed, under conditions that were relaxed in later work by\nBell (1971, 1976) himself and by his followers (Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt 1969, Clauser and Horne 1974, Aspect 1983, Mermin 1986),\nthat, on the assumption of certain auxiliary conditions, no physical\ntheory that satisfies a certain locality condition, which may be\ncalled Bell locality, can fully reproduce the quantum\nprobabilities for outcomes of experiments. Since that time, variants\non the theorem, with family resemblances, have been formulated.\n\u201cBell\u2019s Theorem\u201d is the collective name for the\nentire family.\n\nThe theorem has roots in Bell\u2019s investigations into the status\nof the hidden-variables program, and on earlier work concerning\nquantum entanglement. \n\nBell presented several formulations of the theorem over the years\n(Bell 1964, 1971, 1976, 1990), and variants of it have been presented\nby others. The original derivation (1964) relied on a set-up involving\nperfect anticorrelation of the results of spin experiments on pairs of\nspin-1/2 particles prepared in the singlet state. Under this\ncondition, the Bell locality condition entails that outcomes of\nexperiments are predetermined by the complete specification of state,\na condition which we will call outcome determinism (OD).\nClauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (1969) derived an inequality, the\nCHSH inequality, that does not require this assumption. Though in\ntheir proof they employed the condition OD, this condition is\nunnecessary for the derivation of the inequality, as shown by Bell\n(1971), who provided a proof of the CHSH inequality that relies on\nneither the assumption of perfect anticorrelation nor an assumption of\noutcome determinism. \n\nOne line of investigation in the prehistory of Bell\u2019s Theorem is\nBell\u2019s examination of the hidden-variables program. This program\ninvolves supplementation of the quantum mechanical state of a system\nby further \u201celements of reality\u201d, or \u201chidden\nvariables\u201d, the incompleteness of the quantum state being the\nexplanation for the statistical character of quantum mechanical\npredictions concerning the system. A pioneering version of a hidden\nvariables theory was proposed by Louis de Broglie in 1926\u20137 (de\nBroglie 1927, 1928), and revived by David Bohm in 1952 (Bohm 1952; see\nalso the entry on\n Bohmian mechanics).\n\nIn a paper (Bell 1966) that was written before the one in which\nBell\u2019s theorem first appeared, but, due to an editorial mishap,\nwas published later, Bell raises the question of the viability of\na hidden-variables theory that reproduces the statistical predictions\nof quantum mechanics via averaging over better defined states that\nuniquely determine the result of any experiment that could be\nperformed. In this paper he examines several theorems that had been\npresented as no-go theorems for theories of this sort, and\nsupplements them with one of his own, a theorem that was\nindependently formulated by Specker (1960), and published by Kochen\nand Specker (1967), and has come to be known as the Kochen-Specker\nTheorem or Bell-Kochen Specker Theorem (see\n entry on the Kochen-Specker Theorem\n for more details). In each case Bell argues that the proof contains\npremises that are physically unwarranted.\n\nThe Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem is a corollary of Gleason\u2019s\ntheorem (Gleason 1957), though Bell and Kochen-Specker obtain it\ndirectly, and not via Gleason\u2019s theorem, whose proof is\nconsiderably more intricate. The question addressed by Gleason has to\ndo with assignments of probabilities to closed subspaces of a Hilbert\nspace (or, equivalently, to projection operators onto such subspaces),\nsuch that the probabilities assigned to orthogonal projections are\nadditive. Gleason proved that, in a Hilbert space of dimension 3 or\ngreater, any such assignment of probabilities can be represented by a\ndensity operator. The BKS theorem deals with the special case in which\nthe assignments are confined to the values 1 or 0.\n\nThe assumption that a definite value (1 or 0) is to be assigned to\neach projector on the system\u2019s Hilbert space, with the condition\nthat values assigned to commuting projectors be additive, is a\nweakening of the assumption of the von Neumann no-go theorem (von\nNeumann 1932), which assumes that the quantum mechanical additivity of\nexpectation values of all observables, whether represented by\ncommuting operators or not, extends to the hypothetical\ndispersion-free states (see section 2 of entry on\n the Kochen-Specker Theorem).\n Despite the prima facie plausibility of this assumption,\nBell regards it, too, as physically unmotivated, and therefore, unlike\nKochen and Specker, does not regard the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem as\na no-go theorem for hidden-variables theories. The reason for this is\nthat the assumption embodies a condition that was later to be known as\n noncontextuality.[1]\n In a Hilbert space of dimension greater than two, any projection\noperator will be a member of more than one complete set of commuting\nprojections. For each of these complete sets, there will be an\nexperiment whose outcomes correspond to the projections in the set.\nThe assumption of noncontextuality amounts to the assumption that a\nvalue can be assigned to a projection operator that is independent of\nwhich of these experiments is to be performed, or as Bell puts it,\nthat \u201cmeasurement of an observable must yield the same value\nindependently of what other measurements may be made\nsimultaneously.\u201d The assumption need not hold; \u201c[t]he\nresult of an observation may reasonably depend not only on the state\nof the system (including hidden variables) but also on the complete\ndisposition of the apparatus\u201d (Bell 1966, 451; 1987b and 2004,\n9 ).\n\nNoncontextual hidden-variables theories that reproduce the predictions\nof quantum mechanics are ruled out by the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem.\nA natural question arises as to the possibility of a contextual\nhidden-variables theory on which the unavoidable contextuality is\nrestricted to local dependencies. Is it possible to have a \ntheory on which the outcome of an experiment performed in some spatial\nregion \\(A\\) is determined by the complete state of a system in a\nway that does not depend on the disposition of experimental apparatus\nat a distance from \\(A\\)?\n\nBell\u2019s article ends with a brief exposition of the Bohm theory,\nnoting in particular the feature that \u201cin this theory an\nexplicit causal mechanism exists whereby the disposition of one piece\nof apparatus affects the results obtained with a distant piece\u201d\n(Bell 1966, 452; 1987b and 2004, 11). The article ends with the\nremark,\n\nBohm of course was well aware of these features of his scheme, and has\ngiven them much attention. However, it must be stressed that, to the\npresent writer\u2019s knowledge, there is no proof that\nany hidden variable account of quantum mechanics\nmust have this extraordinary character. It would therefore be\ninteresting, perhaps, to pursue some further \u2018impossibility\nproofs,\u2019 replacing the arbitrary axioms objected to above by\nsome condition of locality, or of separability of distant systems.\n\n\nTo the second of the above-quoted sentences is attached a note:\n\u201cSince the completion of this paper such a proof has been\nfound.\u201d The potential drama of the announcement was spoiled by\nthe fact that the follow-up paper containing the proof (Bell 1964) had\nalready been published (see Jammer 1974, 303, for an account of the\ncircumstances that led to the publication delay).\n\nThe fact that Bell\u2019s theorem has roots into investigations on\nhidden-variables theories has led to a misconception that the theorem\nis a no-go theorem for hidden-variables theories tout court.\nThere could be no such theorem, since, as Bell himself repeatedly\nemphasized, there is a functioning hidden-variables theory, the de\nBroglie-Bohm theory.\n\nAnother line of investigation leading to Bell\u2019s Theorem was the\ninvestigation of quantum mechanical entangled states, that is, quantum\nstates of a composite system that cannot be expressed either as\nproducts of quantum states of the individual components, or as\nmixtures of product states. That quantum mechanics admits of such\nentangled states was discovered by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger (1926) in\none of his pioneering papers, but the significance of this discovery\nwas not emphasized until the paper of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen\n(1935). They examined correlations between the positions and the\nlinear momenta of two well separated spinless particles and concluded\nthat in order to avoid an appeal to nonlocality these correlations\ncould only be explained by \u201celements of physical reality\u201d\nin each particle \u2014 specifically, both definite position and\ndefinite momentum \u2014 and since this description is richer than\npermitted by the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics their\nconclusion is effectively an argument for a hidden variables\ninterpretation.\n [2]\n See also the entry on the\n Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.\n",
