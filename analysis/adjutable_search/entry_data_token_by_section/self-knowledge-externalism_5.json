    "main_text": "The Reductio to Armchair Knowledge of the External World || Reply 4: Self-Knowledge is Empirical\n2.4 Reply 4: Self-Knowledge is Empirical\n\nSo far, the replies to the reductio have been \u201ccombative\u201d\nin that they seek to undermine some tacit or explicit premise therein.\nYet other responses are \u201cconcessive\u201d in that they admit\nthat the reductio has a point. One concessive response is to reject\nEXT in light of the reductio, though as we saw in section 1, EXT has\nits own arguments to contend with. But a different concession,\nconsidered in this section, is to forgo SK. (There is also a\n\u201cquasi-concessive\u201d response, considered in section 2.5,\nwhere the apriority of (3) is simply embraced rather than rejected as\nabsurd.)\n\nSome incompatibilists indeed take the lesson of the reductio to be\nthat SK is false (see, e.g., McKinsey 2002). The sentiment is often\nthat SK should have been highly suspect from the start. Jacob (2004)\nonce expressed this well as follows:\n\n[T]he contemporary philosophical situation is puzzling. On the one\nhand, few if any features of the special epistemic authority granted\nby both the traditional empiricist and the traditional rationalist\npictures of introspective self-knowledge have survived recent\nphilosophical scrutiny. On the other hand, several\nphilosophers\u2026assume that the alleged special epistemic\nauthority granted to introspective self-knowledge by traditional\nepistemology can bear the burden of an argument against content\nexternalism\u2026I take externalism about the contents of an\nindividual\u2019s thoughts\u2026to be more plausible\u2026than\nanything we may think about introspective\nself-knowledge\u2026Imposing top down constraints\u2026from the\nassumptions about the alleged epistemic status of introspective\nself-knowledge sounds to me like putting the cart before the horse.\n(pp. 401, 402)\n\n\nThis attitude is encouraged by research from empirical psychology,\nwhich suggests that self-knowledge is largely an illusion. (See for\ninstance Nisbett & Wilson 1977, Nisbett & Ross 1980, Gopnik\n1983.) However, even if the research shows we are often ignorant of\nour own minds, it does not follow that this is most often the\ncase. In fact, it has been argued that the current research does not\neven preclude infallible self-directed judgments, such as those\ndescribed in section\n 3.1\n (Parent 2016; 2017, ch. 2).\n\nStill, there are other reasons to surrender SK, and this would be one\nway to understand the lesson of the reductio. For instance, well-known\nQuinean arguments exist against apriori knowledge, though this is not\nthe place to discuss these. (But see section 3 of the entry on\n Quine.)\n Ryle 1963, ch. 6 independently argued that self-knowledge is apriori;\nsuch knowledge was instead achieved via empirical observation of\none\u2019s own behavior. Yet many contemporary philosophers balk at\nthis, since it at least underestimate the \u201cauthority\u201d that\nOscar usually has in judging his own mental states (compared to\nothers\u2019 judgments) (Boghossian 1989, pp. 7\u20138). On the\nother hand, given the psychological research mentioned above, a\nneo-Rylean view may provide just the right amount of first-person\nauthority, to the extent that Oscar observes more of his behavior than\nanyone else (Ludlow & Martin 1993; Martin 1994; McGeer 1996).\n\nThere is a more recent incarnation of this sort of view, supported by\nthe latest from cognitive science (Carruthers 2011). The claim is that\none interprets sensory input when attributing thoughts to oneself,\njust as in attributing thoughts to others. However, the \u201csensory\ninput\u201d behind self-attributions may include input from\ninteroception, proprioception, and the like. Nevertheless, the view\nmaintains that interpretation of \u201cinput\u201d is central in\nboth first-person and third-person attributions of thought, which cuts\ninto so called \u201cfirst-person authority.\u201d\n\nA rather different line against SK derives from an externalist view\nabout concept possession. This view hypothesizes that possession of a\n(non-empty) kind concept requires the ability to ostend or\ndemonstratively identify instances of the kind by perceptual\nmeans (Brewer 1999; 2000a; 2000b). If so, then to possess the water\nconcept is already to know perceptually where (instances of) the stuff\nresides. That in turn normally suffices for knowing that water exists.\nSo when it comes to the reductio, the absurdity stems from thinking\nthat (2) is apriori, since knowledge of (2) already rests on knowledge\nof (3). So one can hardly learn (3) for the first time via knowledge\nof (2)\u2014the learning proceeds in the other direction.\n\nIn the acquisition process, however, the role of demonstrative\nidentification may be unclear. Nevertheless, a similar argument\nagainst SK can be formulated as long as some kind of\nempirical knowledge is needed to acquire the water concept. Indeed, it\nis typically assumed that a person acquires a concept from\nexperience\u2014which already portends that acquisition depends on\nempirical knowledge. Yet if that\u2019s right, then even knowledge of\n(2) has an empirical basis, since possession of the water concept\ndoes. Hence, knowledge of (2) does not qualify as purely apriori .\n\n\nIn response, a defender of SK may concede that there is a\n\u201ctraining period\u201d for acquiring a concept. Still, apriori\nknowledge might be possible in that, once the subject has acquired the\nrelevant concepts, she can use them to gain new knowledge\nwithout further empirical inquiry (Boghossian & Peacocke 2000, p.\n2). But one problem is that EXT usually portrays concept possession in\na way that blurs the distinction between the \u201ctraining\nphase\u201d and the post-acquisition phase (Hawthorne 2007, p. 213).\nFor the externalist thought experiments allow a subject to possess\n(e.g.) the sofa concept even prior to being \u201ctrained\u201d that\nno armchair is a\n sofa.[19]\n\n\nA final line against SK is that, if (1) is not apriori (as is\nplausible), it follows that apriori knowledge of (2) is impossible\n(Gertler 2004). After all, if (1) is not apriori, then Oscar\napparently cannot discriminate apriori between his water concept and\nthe Dry Earthian concept. So it seems incorrect to say that (2) is\nsomething known. Now in fact, this raises the extremely\nimportant question of whether such discriminations are necessary for\nself-knowledge, but further discussion will be delayed until section\n3. The discrimination sub-literature usually addresses the \u201cslow\nswitching\u201d arguments rather than the incompatibilist\u2019s\nreductio.\n",
