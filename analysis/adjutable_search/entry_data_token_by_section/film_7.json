    "main_text": "Film as Philosophy\n8. Conclusions and Prognosis\n\nThe philosophy of film has become a significant area for philosophical and\naesthetic research.  Philosophers have concentrated both on aesthetic\nissues about film as an artistic medium \u2014 the philosophy of film\n\u2014 and questions about the philosophical content of films \u2014 films\nas philosophy.  The sophistication and quantity of contributions in\nboth of these areas continue to increase, as more philosophers have taken\nfilm seriously as a subject for philosophical investigation.\nAs film and its related digital media continue to expand in their\ninfluence upon the lives of human beings, the philosophy of film can\nbe expected to become an even more vital area for philosophic\ninvestigation.  In the coming years, we can look forward to new and\ninnovative contributions to this exciting area of philosophical\nresearch.\n",
