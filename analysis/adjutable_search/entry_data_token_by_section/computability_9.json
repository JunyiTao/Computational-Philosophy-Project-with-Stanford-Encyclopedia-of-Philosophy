    "main_text": "Computational Complexity: Functions Computable in Practice || Reductions and Completeness\n4.1 Reductions and Completeness\n\n\nThere has been a large study of algorithms and the complexity of\nmany important problems is well understood. In particular reductions\nbetween problems have been defined and used to compare the relative\ndifficulty of two problems. Intuitively, we say that \\(A\\) is\nreducible to \\(B\\)  \\((A \\le B)\\) if there\nis an easy-to-compute transformation, \\(\\tau\\), that maps instances of \\(A\\) to\ninstances of \\(B\\) in a way that preserves membership, i.e.,\n\\(\\tau\\)(w) \\(\\in B \\Leftrightarrow\\) w \\(\\in A\\).\n\n\nRemarkably, a high percentage of naturally occurring computational\nproblems turn out to be complete for one of the above classes. (A\nproblem, \\(A\\), is complete for a complexity class \\(C\\) if\n\\(A\\) is a member of \\(C\\) and all other problems \\(B\\)\nin \\(C\\) are no harder than \\(A\\), i.e., \\(B \\le A\\). Two complete problems for the same class have equivalent\ncomplexity.)\n\n\nThe reason for this completeness phenomenon has not been adequately\nexplained. One plausible explanation is that natural computational\nproblems tend to be universal in the sense of Turing\u2019s universal\nmachine. A universal problem in a certain complexity class can simulate\nany other problem in that class.\n\n\nIn 1971, Cook proved SAT is NP complete [Cook, 1971].  Shortly later, \nKarp showed that many important combinatorial problems were also\nNP complete, thus establishing the importance of the class NP [Karp, 1972].\n\n\n\nOur definition of reduction above lacked precision, just saying that the mapping \\(\\tau\\) must by\neasy-to-compute.  The reductions that Karp used were polynomial-time reductions, i.e., \\(\\tau\\) is\ncomputable in polynomial time.  \nSince then, many researchers have observed that natural problems\nremain complete for natural complexity classes under surprisingly weak\nreductions including logspace reductions [Jones, 1973], first-order reductions [Immerman, 1999],\nprojections [Valiant, 1982], and first-order projections [Immerman, 1999].\n\n\n\nWith a very few exceptions, when a natural problem is in NP, it turns out to be either NP complete,\nor in P.  People wondered whether this was always the case.  Ladner proved that if P \\(\\ne\\)  NP, then\nthere is an intermediate problem \\(I\\) that is in NP but not in P and not NP complete [Ladner, 1975].\n\n\n\nLadner\u2019s proof method is called delayed diagonalization.  He generalized his result to show that for\nany two well-behaved complexity classes, C, E such that C is strictly contained in E, there is an\nintermediate class, D such that C is strictly contained in D and D is strictly contained in E.  Thus\nthe ordering of complexity classes is dense.\n\n\n\nHowever, these intermediate problems don\u2019t tend to show up.   This phenomenon has received a great deal of\nattention recently via the dichotomy conjecture of Feder and Vardi [Feder and Vardi, 1999].\nSchaefer introduced this work with an insightful paper in which he studied all\nvariants of the boolean satisfiability problem [Schaefer, 1978].   He proved that each such problem\n    was either NP \ncomplete or in P, thus Ladner\u2019s intermediate problems\ncannot occur among such satisfiability problems.  Since there were just these two possibilities,\nSchaefer called this a dichotomy. \n\n\n\nIn fact, if one looks closer, all of Schaefer\u2019s satisfiability problems are either NP complete, P\ncomplete, \\(\\oplus\\)L complete, NL complete, L complete, or trivial [Allender et al., 2009].  That is the\nnon-trivial problems \nin P may be P complete, or complete for one of these three complexity classes within P.  In other\nwords, if we look closer, the NP/P dichotomy phenomenon problem is really a \u201cmulti-chotomoy\u201d\nphenomenon, namely all non-trivial satisfiability problems are complete for one of five well-known\ncomplexity classes.\n\n\n\nFeder and Vardi studied Schaefer\u2019s dichotomy and conjectured that it holds for all finite-domain\nConstraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) [Feder and Vardi, 1999].\nA finite-domain CSP, C, consists of a finite domain, D, and a finite set of relations \\(R_1,\n\\ldots , R_k\\) over D.  An instance of C consists of a set of variables, \\(v_1, \\ldots v_n\\)\nand a conjunction of atoms \\(\\varphi  \\equiv \\bigwedge R_i(v_{j_1}, \\ldots)\\).\nThe answer to the instance, \\(\\varphi\\), is \u201cyes\u201d, i.e., \\(\\varphi \\in C\\) iff there is an assignment of the\nvariables to elements of the domain, D, so that \\(\\varphi\\) is satisfied.\n\n\n\nWith domains of size 2, a CSP problem is just a satisfiability problem, so Schaefer\u2019s theorem\nalready established the Feder and Vardi conjecture for this case.\nA simple instance of a CSP with domain size 3 is the 3COLOR problem for undirected graphs.  Given such a\ngraph, G, can the vertices of G be colored one of three colors so that no two adjacent vertices have\nthe same color?  To write this as a CSP, let \\(D = \\{R,Y,B\\}\\) be a set of three distinct colors and\nlet the relation \\(N\\) be the not-equal relation  on \\(D\\).  Then from \\(G=(V,E)\\) the instance of 3COLOR\nis\n\\[ \\varphi_G \\quad = \\quad \\bigwedge_{(u,v)\\in E} N(u,v)\\; .\\]\nNote that \\(\\varphi_G\\) says that whenever there is an edge in \\(G\\) between vertices \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), then \\(u\\)\nand \\(v\\) are assigned different colors.\n\n\n\nFeder and Vardi\u2019s conjecture led to an extremely productive research program.  \nIn particular, a rich algebraic theory of CSPs was developed in a number of papers starting with\n[Jeavons et al. 1997]; see [Bulatov, 2018] for a survey.\nEventually, by applying and advancing this algebraic theory, Bulatov and Zhuk independently proved\nthe Feder and\nVardi conjecture [Bulatov, 2017; Zhuk, 2017]. \n\n",
