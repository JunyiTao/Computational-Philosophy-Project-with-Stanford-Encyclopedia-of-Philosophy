    "main_text": "Basic Principles of Reality || The Method of Archai\n2.3 The Method of Archai\n\nIn each area of inquiry Philolaus appears to proceed by identifying\nthe minimum number of archai, \u201cbeginnings\u201d or\n\u201cstarting points,\u201d necessary to explain the phenomena in\nthat area (Huffman 1993, 78\u201392). In the case of the cosmos as a\nwhole, as we have just seen in Fr. 6, Philolaus argues that three\nstarting points must be assumed, limiters, unlimiteds, and harmony, as\na third element to hold these two unlike elements together. In the\ncase of disease, Philolaus identifies three archai, bile,\nblood and phlegm (see 6.2 below). In the case of living creatures, the\nbrain is the starting point to which we must appeal to explain human\nbeings, the heart as the seat of sensation is the crucial factor in\nexplaining animals, the navel as the seat of rooting (the umbilical\ncord is regarded as a root) is the distinctive starting point of\nplants, and finally the genitals are a factor common to all animate\nbeings in contrast to the inanimate world (Fr. 13, see 5.1). This\napproach to explanation seems to have been developed under the\ninfluence of contemporary mathematicians and medical writers. Graham\nargues that in his use of archai to mean something like\n\u201cprinciples\u201d Philolaus achieves \u201c a level of\nabstraction that surpasses ... probably all of his predecessors\u201d\nand takes an important step towards Aristotle\u2019s conception of\narchai as starting points of being or explanation (Graham\n2014: 62). \n",
