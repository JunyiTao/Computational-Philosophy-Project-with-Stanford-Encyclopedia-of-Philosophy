    "main_text": "Global Indeterminacy without Local Indeterminacy\n8. Global Indeterminacy without Local Indeterminacy?\n\nContextualists base their holism about vagueness on top-down\npsychology. Holism can also be logical. We encountered this in the\nsupervaluationist\u2019s rejection of truth-functionality. Instead of\ncalculating the truth-values of all compound statements bottom-up from\nthe truth-values of their component statements, Kit Fine (1975)\nassigned truth-values top-down by counting a statement as true if it\ncomes out true under all admissible precisifications of the entire\nlanguage.\n\nFine\u2019s (2020) new holism parachutes in from R. M.\nSainsbury\u2019s (1996) characterization of vagueness in terms of\nboundarylessness. A precise predicate such as\n\u2018thirty-something\u2019 organizes cases into pigeonholes.\nPositive cases commence at thirty and cease at thirty nine. But\nparadigms and foils of \u2018thirty-ish\u2019 operate as poles of a\nmagnet. Candidates for \u2018thirty-ish\u2019 resemble iron filings.\nThis force field prevents completion of a forced-march sorites\nargument (in which we are marched from a definite instance of a\npredicate to a definite non-instance). Judgment must be suspended\nsomewhere in the series. But it does not follow that there is any\nspecific case such that one must suspend judgment about it.\n\nBorderline status has the mobility of a bubble in a level. The\nprecisificationist\u2019s mistake is to remove the bubble.\nPeirce\u2019s mistake is to freeze the bubble into intrinsic\nuncertainty. This is the dual of the error Peirce attributes to\nRen\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 method of universal doubt. Doubting\neverything is impossible because doubt only gets leverage against a\nfulcrum of presuppositions. (Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s analogy is\nwith the hinges of a door that hold fast in order that the door of\ndoubt can open and close.) These presuppositions are indubitable in\nthe sense that they cannot be challenged within the inquiry.\nWhen the skeptic claims to doubt everything, he winds up doubting\nnothing. The skeptic\u2019s sham doubts are belied by the absence of\nany interruption of his habits. A genuine doubt triggers inquiry.\nInquiry requires presupposition. These background beliefs must be\ntaken for granted. But the necessary existence of certainty does not\nentail any intrinsic certitudes. What must be presupposed for one\ninquiry need not be presupposed for another. By Fine\u2019s\nreckoning, Peirce should have issued a parallel rejection of intrinsic\nuncertitudes. Within any inquiry, there must be some suspension of\njudgment. But it does not follow that any proposition must resist all\ninquiry.\n\nConsider a literary historiographer who, weary of debate about the\nidentity of the first book, demonstrates that \u2018book\u2019 is\nvague by assembling a slippery slope ranging from early non-books to\nparadigm books. According to Peirce, the demonstration succeeds only\nif the spectrum contains some intrinsically doubtful cases. They are\nwhat makes \u2018book\u2019 vague. Fine\u2019s negative thesis is\nthat this reductionist explanation relies on impossible explanans. A\nbooklet can no more be an intrinsically borderline book than it can be\nintrinsically misshelved. Fine\u2019s positive thesis is that\nslippery slopes suffice to demonstrate the vagueness of\n\u2018book\u2019. There are borderline books only in the way there\nare heavy books. In contrast to \u2018mass\u2019,\n\u2018heavy\u2019 requires relativization to a gravitational field.\n\u2018Borderline\u2019 requires relativization to a range of\ncases.\n\nMany-valued logicians have long contended that local indeterminacy is\nincompatible with the law of excluded middle. Fine\u2019s (1975)\nsupervaluationism was designed to reconcile the two. But now Fine\nconcedes the incompatibility. Unlike the many-valued logician, Fine\nblames all the inconsistency on local indeterminacy. Indeed, Fine\ncontinues to think the law of excluded middle is undeniable (which is\nnot to say it must be affirmed). What Fine does deny is\nconjunctive excluded middle: (\\(B \\vee \\neg B) \\wedge (C \\vee\n\\neg C) \\wedge (D \\vee \\neg D) \\wedge \\ldots .\\)  For this principle\nimplies that there is a sharp cut-off in a forced-march sorites\nparadox.\n\nSince conjunctive excluded middle is a theorem of classical logic,\nFine proposes a compatibility semantics that bears a family\nresemblance to intuitionism. Fine reconstructs a pedigree by modifying\nSaul Kripke\u2019s semantics for intuitionistic logic. Timothy\nWilliamson (2020) objects that the resulting logic condemns even more\ninnocent inferences than intuitionism. Others defend local\nindeterminacy by saying that there are paradigm cases of intrinsically\nuncertain propositions such as those opening section one. Paradigms\nsuch as the decapitation riddle concern qualitative vagueness rather\nthan the quantitative vagueness that generates a forced-march sorites\nargument. Kit Fine is at work on a future book that may address the\nworry that his account is incomplete or disjunctive.\n",
