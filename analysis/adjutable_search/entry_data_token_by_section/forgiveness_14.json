    "main_text": "Self-forgiveness\n6. Self-forgiveness\n\nIn the recent years, the topic of self-forgiveness has drawn\nconsiderable attention (see, e.g., Williston 2012; Milam 2015).\nIndeed, it does seem a commonplace that people claim to forgive\nthemselves both for wrongs they commit against others, and for\nself-directed wrongs in the form of some sort of personal failure or\nshortcoming, such as violating a commitment to another person; or\nfailing to adhere to a diet. Although there seems to be no logical\nreason to think self-forgiveness as overcoming various forms of\nself-directed moral reactive attitudes such as disappointment or\ndisgust is fundamentally unlike interpersonal forgiveness, there are\nsignificant differences between the two. First, and notwithstanding\nthe fact that people may be angry with themselves, experience\nself-directed loathing, and struggle to overcome such negative\nemotional attitudes, it is not clear that the idea of resenting\noneself is coherent and, thus, whether forgiveness as overcoming\nself-referential resentment is possible, at least on certain accounts\nof forgiveness. This is because resentment in the sense at issue\nrequires such cognitions as that the wrongdoer is a moral agent and\nthe victim a moral subject whose rights are in some way violated by a\nwrongdoer. That one and the same person is involved simultaneously as\nagent and subject, wrongdoer and victim, in this drama is often\nthought incompatible with the idea that resentment is necessarily\ndirected at other people (Arendt 1958).\n\nNancy Snow (1992) argues that self-forgiveness serves two important\nself-regarding purposes (though see Hughes 1994). First, it serves the\npurpose of restoring wrongdoers to full moral agency even in the\nabsence of the victim\u2019s forgiveness. This is similar to\nHolmgren\u2019s claim (1998) that self-forgiving is a way of\nrestoring or maintaining one\u2019s intrinsic self-worth, which she\nargues is an extension of her analysis of interpersonal forgiveness.\nZenon Szablowinski (2011) concurs, arguing that a failure to\nself-forgive may be detrimental to a wrongdoer\u2019s moral and\npsychological well-being, and that such forgiveness is morally\nappropriate when a wrongdoer\u2019s guilt, shame, or self-loathing\nreach significantly high levels. Second, it constitutes a second-best\nalternative to full interpersonal forgiveness, in the sense that when\nfull interpersonal forgiveness is not forthcoming (and there can be\nmany reasons for this), self-forgiving is nevertheless an important\nand sometimes morally appropriate response to having done wrong.\n",
