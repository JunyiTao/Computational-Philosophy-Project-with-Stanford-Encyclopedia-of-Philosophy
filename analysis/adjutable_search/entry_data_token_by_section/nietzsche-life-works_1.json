Early Writings: 1872\u20131876\n\nNietzsche\u2019s first book was published in 1872 and was entitled\nThe Birth of Tragedy, Out of the Spirit of Music (Die\nGeburt der Trag\u00f6die aus dem Geiste der Musik). Overall, it\nsets forth a more visceral and existential alternative to the late\n18th/early 19th century understanding of Greek culture\u2014an\nunderstanding largely inspired by Johann Winckelmann\u2019s\nHistory of Ancient Art (1764)\u2014which, grounded on the\naesthetics of classical sculpture, hailed ancient Greece as the\nepitome of noble simplicity, calm grandeur, clear blue skies, and\nrational serenity. In 1886, Nietzsche\u2019s book was reissued with a\nrevised title, The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and\nPessimism (Die Geburt der Trag\u00f6die, Oder: Griechentum\nund Pessimismus), along with a lucid and revealing prefatory\nessay\u2014\u201cAn Attempt at Self-Criticism\u201d\u2014which\nexpresses Nietzsche\u2019s own critical reflections on the book,\nlooking back fourteen years. Although he remained proud of the work,\nNietzsche also describes it as questionable, strange and almost\ninaccessible, filled with Kantian and Schopenhauerian formulas that\nwere inherently at odds with the new valuations he was trying to\nexpress.\n\nHaving by this time absorbed the Schopenhauerian view that\nnon-rational forces reside at the foundation of all creativity and of\nreality itself, and that these forces are artistically best conveyed\nin music, Nietzsche identifies a strongly instinctual, wild, amoral,\n\u201cDionysian\u201d energy within pre-Socratic Greek culture as an\nessentially creative and healthy force, locating its prime expression\nin the tragic chorus, and constituting the very life of the tragedy.\nSurveying the history of Western culture since the time of the Greeks,\nNietzsche laments over how this Dionysian, creative energy had been\nsubmerged and weakened as it became overshadowed by the\n\u201cApollonian\u201d forces of logical order and stiff sobriety.\nHe concludes that European culture since the time of Socrates has\nremained one-sidedly Apollonian, repressed, scientific, and relatively\nunhealthy. Wagner expressed similar sentiments in his 1849 essay\n\u201cArt and Revolution,\u201d as he described Western society as\nhaving been on the decline since the times of the ancient Greeks. \n\nAs a means towards a cultural rebirth, Nietzsche advocates in\ncontemporary life, the resurrection and fuller release of Dionysian\nartistic energies\u2014those which he associates with primordial\ncreativity, joy in existence and ultimate truth. The seeds of this\nliberating rebirth Nietzsche perceives in the German music of his time\n(viz., Bach, Beethoven and especially Wagner), and the concluding part\nof The Birth of Tragedy, in effect, adulates the emerging\nGerman artistic, tragic spirit as the potential savior of European\nculture. As one of his early books, The Birth of Tragedy has\na strong Wagnerian and Schopenhauerian flavor, and scholars disagree\nabout the extent to which Nietzsche departs from Schopenhauer in this\nwork and in later works.\n\nSome regard Nietzsche\u2019s 1873 unpublished essay, \u201cOn Truth\nand Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\u201d (\u201c\u00dcber Wahrheit und\nL\u00fcge im au\u00dfermoralischen Sinn\u201d) as a keystone in\nhis thought; some believe that it is a peripheral, conflicted and\nnon-representative fragment in his writings. In this essay, Nietzsche\nrejects the idea of universal constants, and claims, presumably as a\ntruth, that what we call \u201ctruth\u201d is only \u201ca mobile\narmy of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.\u201d His view at\nthis time is that arbitrariness prevails within human experience:\nconcepts originate via the transformation of nerve stimuli into\nimages, and \u201ctruth\u201d is nothing more than the invention of\nfixed conventions for practical purposes, especially those of repose,\nsecurity and consistency. Nietzsche regards our\n\u201cknowledge\u201d as human, all-too-human, mostly a matter of\nself-deception that issues from a deep-seated exercise of metaphorical\nthought. Viewing our existence from a vast and sobering distance,\nNietzsche further notes that there was an eternity before human beings\ncame into existence, and believes that after humanity dies out,\nnothing significant will have changed in the great scheme of\nthings.\n\nBetween 1873 and 1876, Nietzsche wrote the Unfashionable\nObservations (Unzeitgem\u00e4sse Betrachtungen, also\ntranslated as Untimely Meditations or Thoughts Out of\nSeason). These are four (of a projected, but never completed,\nthirteen) studies concerned with the quality of European, and\nespecially German, culture during Nietzsche\u2019s time. They are\nunfashionable and nonconformist (or \u201cuntimely,\u201d or\n\u201cunmodern,\u201d or \u201cout of place\u201d) insofar as\nNietzsche regarded his standpoint as culture-critic to be in tension\nwith the self-congratulatory spirit of the times. The four studies\nwere: David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer (David\nStrauss, der Bekenner und der Schriftsteller, 1873); On the\nUses and Disadvantages of History for Life (Vom Nutzen und\nNachteil der Historie f\u00fcr das Leben, 1874); Schopenhauer\nas Educator (Schopenhauer als Erzieher, 1874);\nRichard Wagner in Bayreuth (1876).\n\nThe first of these attacks David Strauss, whose popular six-edition\nbook, The Old and the New Faith: A Confession (1871)\nencapsulated for Nietzsche the general cultural atmosphere in Germany.\nResponding to Strauss\u2019s advocacy of a \u201cnew faith\u201d\ngrounded upon a scientifically-determined universal\nmechanism\u2014one, however, lubricated by the optimistic,\n\u201csoothing oil\u201d of historical progress\u2014Nietzsche\ncriticizes Strauss\u2019s view as a vulgar and dismal sign of\ncultural degeneracy. Nietzsche\u2019s friend, Overbeck, in his\ncontemporaneous writings, also adopted a critical attitude towards\nStrauss. The second \u201cuntimely meditation\u201d surveys\nalternative ways to write history, and discusses how these ways could\ncontribute to a society\u2019s health. Here Nietzsche claims that the\nprinciple of \u201clife\u201d is a more pressing and higher concern\nthan that of \u201cknowledge,\u201d and that the quest for knowledge\nshould serve the interests of life. This parallels how, in The\nBirth of Tragedy, Nietzsche had looked at art through the\nperspective of life and foreshadows Nietzsche\u2019s hallmark theme\nof \u201clife-affirmation\u201d in his later works.\n\nThe third and fourth studies\u2014on Schopenhauer and Wagner,\nrespectively\u2014address how these two thinkers, as paradigms of\nphilosophic and artistic genius, hold the potential to inspire a\nstronger, healthier and livelier German culture. Nietzsche states here\nthat we all have a duty to help nature complete its goal of producing\nthe highest examples of the human being\u2014these will be the\n\u201cnew redeemers\u201d\u2014which he recognizes in superb\ninstances of the philosopher, the artist and the saint\n(\u201cSchopenhauer as Educator,\u201d Section 5). These celebratory\nstudies on Schopenhauer and Wagner reveal how, as a recurring feature\nof Nietzsche\u2019s thought, he presents us with some higher type of\ncharacter\u2014he offers different models of heroic characters as the\nyears go by\u2014as an ideal towards which he would have his best\nreaders aspire.\n",
