    "main_text": "Animal Cognition Applied to Philosophy || Consciousness\n3.3 Consciousness\n\nPhilosophers are developing theories of consciousness that are\nsensitive to studies of neurobiological and psychological properties\nof animals, including pain, emotions, decision-making, learning,\nmemory, and future planning. Philosophers are also using theories of\nconsciousness to argue for or against animal consciousness. For\nexample, in his book Human and Animal Minds: The Consciousness\nQuestions Laid to Rest (2019), Peter Carruthers argues that since\nconsciousness is neural processing in a human global workspace, and\nnonhuman animals lack the equivalent to a human global workspace, it\ndoesn\u2019t make sense to continue asking whether animals are\nconscious. In contrast, Michael Tye (1997) argues that on his PANIC\ntheory of consciousness most vertebrates and invertebrates will be\nconscious, because they have to evaluate their sense data in order to\nact. Such theory-first approaches often end in a standoff between\ntheories.\n\nSome philosophers and scientists also argue from a more\npre-theoretical position that many species are conscious. In their\nplea for a new science of consciousness, Francis Crick and Christof\nKoch (1990) decided to assume that some mammals are conscious in order\nto study consciousness in animals, which might explain the widespread\nuse of macaque monkeys as research subjects in consciousness studies.\nAndrews (2020c) argues that presuming animal consciousness in this way\nhas a precedent in human sciences; while we can\u2019t prove\nthat humans are conscious, we are justified in presuming\nhumans are conscious, just as we are justified in presuming that there\nis an external world, and that we\u2019re not merely brains in vats.\nThe premise that humans are conscious allows us to do good science,\nand generates findings that are robustly predictive and support other\nfacts that we believe are true. If the premise that animals are\nconscious also supports the fecundity of science, it should be taken\nas starting point.\n\nA common theory-light approach deals with markers for consciousness. A\nmarker is an indicator of something we cannot directly perceive, and\nin the case of consciousness we find markers by relying on our own\nphenomenological experience. For example, in his book Personhood,\nEthics, and Animal Cognition (2012), Gary Varner relies on\nbehavior and physiology of pain in order to argue that nociceptors\nconnected to the brain, endogenous opioids, responsiveness to\nanalgesics, and appropriate pain behavior are sufficient indicators of\nconsciousness. Scientific data current at the time suggested to Varner\nthat all vertebrates experience pain, but among the invertebrates, the\ncurrent science only suggested pain in cephalopods (such as octopus,\nsquid, and cuttlefish). More recently, Tye\u2019s Tense Bees and\nShell-Shocked Crabs: Are Animals Conscious? (2017) suggests we\nuse Newton\u2019s Principle (\u201cfrom similar effects we can infer\nsimilar causes\u201d) and the premise that certain human behaviors\nare caused by consciousness to infer that certain animal behaviors are\ncaused by conscious experience; this approach finds consciousness in\ncrabs, bees, and fish, as well as mammals, birds, and reptiles.\n\nYet another way of finding markers of consciousness is to ask what\nconsciousness is for\u2014the function of consciousness. In their\nbook The Evolution of the Sensitive Soul, Simona Ginsburg and\nEva Jablonka (2019) propose that consciousness evolved with the\ndevelopment of a capacity for an open-ended kind of learning they call\nUnlimited Associative Learning (UAL), originating in the Cambrian era.\nUAL permits organisms to assign value to new and complex stimuli, to\nremember the associations with these stimuli, and to use those\nmemories to make decisions in the future.\n\nThis tension between these different approaches has led philosophers\nto engage in meta-theoretical analysis of how best to answer the\nquestion. Jonathan Birch argues that the debate about invertebrate\nconsciousness can move forward if we adopt a theory-light approach\nover theory-heavy and theory-neutral approaches (Birch forthcoming).\nEric Schwitzgebel (2019) argues that when we rely on a theory of\nconsciousness in order to answer questions about consciousness in\nanimals who are very different from us, such as garden snails, we\ninevitably beg the question, suggesting that any theory-first approach\nto such questions is not going to be helpful. To move forward on\nquestions of consciousness in beings who are very different from the\nmammals, birds, and reptiles many naturally take to be conscious,\nAndrews (2020b) sketches a method she calls the Dynamic Marker\nApproach, which starts by identifying the properties that trigger\nhuman commitments to consciousness in familiar animals, and then\nderives further markers that can be used to identify consciousness in\nunfamiliar ones.\n",
