So computational\nlinguistics is very important.\u201d\n\n\u2013Mark Steedman, ACL Presidential Address (2007)\n\n\n\nComputational linguistics is the scientific and engineering\ndiscipline concerned with understanding written and spoken language\nfrom a computational perspective, and building artifacts that usefully\nprocess and produce language, either in bulk or in a dialogue setting.\nTo the extent that language is a mirror of mind, a computational\nunderstanding of language also provides insight into thinking and\nintelligence. And since language is our most natural and most versatile\nmeans of communication, linguistically competent computers would\ngreatly facilitate our interaction with machines and software of all\nsorts, and put at our fingertips, in ways that truly meet our needs,\nthe vast textual and other resources of the internet.\n\nThe following article outlines the goals and methods of\ncomputational linguistics (in historical perspective), and then delves\nin some detail into the essential concepts of  linguistic\nstructure and analysis (section 2),  interpretation (sections\n3\u20135), and language use (sections 6\u20137), as well as acquisition of\nknowledge for language (section 8), statistical and machine learning\ntechniques in natural language processing (section 9), and\nmiscellaneous applications (section 10).\n\n",
