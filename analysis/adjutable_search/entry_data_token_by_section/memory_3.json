    "main_text": "Kinds of Memory || Alternative taxonomies\n2.2 Alternative taxonomies\n\nSquire\u2019s taxonomy has been extremely influential,\nbut alternative taxonomies have been proposed in both psychology and\nphilosophy. In psychology, Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) proposed a\nmulti-store model in which kinds of memory are distinguished in terms\nof their temporal duration. Ultra short term memory refers to the\npersistence of modality-specific sensory information for periods of\nless than one second. Short term memory refers to the persistence of\ninformation for up to thirty seconds; short term memory, which\nreceives information from ultra short term memory, is to some extent\nunder conscious control but is characterized by a limited capacity.\nLong term memory refers to the storage of information over\nindefinitely long periods of time; long term memory receives\ninformation from short term memory and is characterized by an\neffectively unlimited capacity. Though this taxonomy does not\ndistinguish among importantly different kinds of long term\nmemory\u2014in particular, it does not distinguish\nbetween episodic and semantic memory\u2014it has been\napplied productively in psychological research. With rare exceptions\n(Werning & Cheng 2017), however, it has not\ninformed philosophical discussions.\n\nIn philosophy, Bernecker (2010) has proposed a purely grammatical\napproach, arguing that the kinds of memory are given by the kinds of\nobjects that the verb \u201cto \nremember\u201d can take. He thus\ndistinguishes among memory for objects, memory for properties, memory\nfor events, and memory for propositions or facts. While a grammatical\napproach will strike many in philosophy as natural, this particular\ntaxonomy has so far not been taken up very widely. This may be due in\npart to the fact that, because the basis for the taxonomy is purely\nlinguistic, it has difficulty distinguishing between episodic memory\nas such, which is arguably characterized by a particular\nphenomenology, and mere event memory, which lacks this phenomenology\n(Schechtman 2011). It may also be due in part to the fact that,\nbecause it cuts across the categories employed by the standard\ntaxonomy, it is difficult to apply Bernecker\u2019s\ntaxonomy to studies that rely on the latter.\n",
