    "main_text": "Leibniz on the Laws of Motion || Absolute or relative motion?\n4.3 Absolute or relative motion?\n\n\nAs far as kinematics is concerned, Leibniz, like most of his \ncontemporaries, accepted the observational under-determination of \nconstant linear motion. That is to say, he granted that \u2013 if we\nbracket considerations of force \u2013 there\u2019s no saying which of \ntwo bodies moving relative to each other with a constant velocity is \nreally moving. So, for example, Leibniz would have conceded \nthat we can\u2019t tell just by looking whether Train A or \nTrain B is really moving, even if they are moving \nwith a constant velocity relative to one another. This observational \nunder-determination or \u201cinvariance\u201d \u2013 often called \nGalilean invariance \u2013 is still accepted today, \nalthough the natural assumption that it makes sense to speak of any \nbody as \u201creally\u201d moving with a constant velocity \nindependently of an arbitrarily chosen frame of reference is not. \n\n\nContinuing to restrict ourselves to kinematics, Leibniz appears to \nembrace something even stronger than Galilean invariance. He suggests\nthat not only is constant linear motion observationally \nunderdetermined, but furthermore that \u201cIf we consider change in\nposition alone, or that which is merely mathematical in \nmotion,\u201d then all motion is observationally \nunderdetermined (A VI.iv.2017/Lodge 2003, 278). That is to say, he \nseems to accept that not even accelerations \u2013 changes in \ndirection or speed \u2013 can be detected by empirical observation. \nThus, for example, he writes:\n\n\nThe law of nature concerning the equivalence of hypotheses that we \nestablished earlier, namely, that a hypothesis which once corresponds\nto the present phenomena will always correspond to the subsequent \nphenomena in that way, is not only true for rectilinear motion but \nmore generally, however the bodies act on one another, just as long \nas the system of bodies is isolated from others, or no external agent\ncomes along. (GM VI.507/Lodge 2003, 280) \n\n\nEven if we grant that we cannot tell whether it is our train that is \ngliding along with a constant velocity or the train that we see \nthrough the window, we might nonetheless maintain that we can tell \n\u2013 by, say, the sudden jerk we feel \u2013 if our train has \njust accelerated by increasing its speed, or \u2013 because we feel \nourselves pushed against the wall \u2013 that it is rounding a sharp\ncorner. Leibniz, however, seems to deny \n this,[27]\n insisting instead that \u201cno eye, wherever in matter it might be \nplaced, has a sure criterion for telling from the phenomena where \nthere is motion, how much motion there is and of what sort it is, \nor even whether God moves everything around it, or whether he \nmoves that very eye itself\u201d (AG \n 91).[28]\n\n\n\nFrom the observational under-determination of all motion considered \nkinematically, Leibniz infers that if there were nothing more to \nmotion than change of position relative to other bodies, then there \nwould be no real or genuine motion in the world at \n all.[29]\n He is thus committed to maintaining that if there were nothing more \nto motion than relative change of position, then, since motion could \nbe ascribed with equal right to, say, Train A or Train \nB, then there would be no fact of the matter as to whether \nTrain A or Train B is moving, and thus it would \nmake no sense to say that either Train A or Train B\nis moving. The suggestion that motion be treated as irreducibly \nrelational \u2013 so that motion could be ascribed to Train \nA relative to one reference frame, and to Train B \nrelative to another reference frame \u2013 would have had no \nattraction for Leibniz, who consistently denied that there are any \ngenuine external relations (i.e. relations that do not wholly \nsupervene on intrinsic properties). \n\n\nAccepting the observational under-determination of motion understood \nas mere change of relative position, and finding absurd the \nconsequence that there is no genuine motion in the world, Leibniz \ndenies the premise that there is nothing more to motion than relative\nchange of position. He thus maintains that rather than grant that \nthere is no real motion, \u201cin order to say that something is \nmoving, we will require not only that it change its position with \nrespect to other things but also that there be within itself a cause \nof change, a force, an action\u201d (G IV.396/L 393). Intuitively, \nLeibniz\u2019s suggestion is that genuine motion requires, in addition to \nrelative change of place, a cause of that relative change. To return \nto our earlier example, if Train A moves relative to Train \nB, we should say, according to Leibniz, that Train \nA really moves if and only if, it is the active cause of \ntheir relative motion. Since, for Leibniz, being an active cause, or \nlocus of force, is a non-relativistic property attributable to \nindividual bodies, it is in principle capable of breaking the \n\u201cequivalence of hypotheses\u201d and thus grounding true or \ngenuine motion. \n\n\nWhile force, however, thus provides the necessary metaphysical \ngrounds for the existence of genuine motions, it does not, at least \nas far as the physicist is concerned, solve the empirical issue of \nwhich bodies can be ascribed genuine motion (Garber 1995, 307; but \nsee also Lodge 2003). For, as we have seen, the ascription of force \n\u2013 of vis viva or mv2 \n\u2013 is itself empirically relative to a frame of reference. The \npostulation of force makes genuine motion possible; it does not tell \nus which bodies are genuinely in motion and which are moved merely \nrelatively. In practice Leibniz thus counsels that \u2013 as in \nastronomy \u2013 \u201cone can hold the simplest hypothesis \n(everything considered) as the true one\u201d (GM II 184/AG 308). \nAlthough the metaphysician can rest assured that true motion must be \nabsolute, the physicist must therefore be content to work with \nrelative motions and simplifying assumptions. \n",
