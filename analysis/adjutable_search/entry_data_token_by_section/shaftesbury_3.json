    "main_text": "Introduction || Relationship to Stoicism\n1.4 Relationship to Stoicism\n\nA closely related question is how best to understand\nShaftesbury\u2019s relationship to Stoicism. Stoicism was clearly a\nmajor influence on Shaftesbury, but the exact nature of his\nthought\u2019s relationship to Stoicism is a matter of debate. Some\ncommentators argue that Shaftesbury is essentially a Stoic through and\nthrough (Tiffany 1923; see also Sellars 2016 and Stuart-Buttle 2019).\nOthers argue that some of his ideas comport with Stoicism, while\nothers do not (Maurer and Jaffro 2013).\n\nThe strong Stoic interpretation emphasizes the unpublished\nAskemata, which are notebooks in which Shaftesbury engages in\na process of self-improvement based on Stoic principles (see Klein\n1994: 60 and 81\u201388; Rivers 2000a: 92; Taylor 1989: 251\u20132;\nGatti 2014). Shaftesbury refers to and quotes Stoic sources throughout\nAskemata. When he was writing in these notebooks, Shaftesbury\nseems to have Stoic ideas in the forefront of his mind, and proceeds\non the assumption that those ideas are the key to becoming the person\nhe wants to be. As well, Shaftesbury\u2019s unpublished\nPathologia is a Latin text that is entirely devoted to an\nexplication of Stoic psychology. Shaftesbury\u2019s unpublished\nChartae Socraticae can also be read as an endorsement of\nStoicism and a rejection of contemporary philosophy.\n\nThe main idea the strong Stoic interpretation believes Shaftesbury\nemphasizes is an exclusive concern with the state of one\u2019s own\nsoul, which is within one\u2019s own control, and a resultant\nwithdrawing of concern from everything else. This interpretation\nhighlights the many passages in Askemata in which Shaftesbury\nurges himself to focus only on his internal state, to maintain\nequanimity, not to allow anything external to disturb his serenity.\nShaftesbury\u2019s choice of illustration for the frontispiece of\nCharacteristicks echoes this idea: it\u2019s a ship on a bay\nand a ray of light on a still dish of water, which is intended to\nillustrate quotations from Marcus (\u201cWhat view you take is\neverything, and your view is in your power. Remove it when you choose,\nand then, as if you had rounded the cape, come calm serenity, a\nwaveless bay\u201d) and Epictetus (\u201cAs is the water-dish, so is\nthe soul; as is the ray which falls on the water, so are the\nappearances\u201d). (For discussion of this illustration, see\nPaknadel 1974, 297\u20138.)\n\nThere are, however, aspects of Characteristicks that other\ncommentators have thought to be at odds with the strong Stoic\ninterpretation. Maurer and Jaffro (2013) maintain that\nShaftesbury\u2019s concern with the public good and his endorsement\nof pity do not fit with the Stoic view. Klein\u2019s reading (1994)\nemphasizes the importance Shaftesbury places on aesthetic beauty,\npoliteness, and manners, and how those might differ from Stoicism.\nShaftesbury also refrains from publishing his own thought in the\nsystematic form distinctive of much of Stoic thought (compare to\nPathologia).\n\nDefenders of the strong Stoic interpretation suggest that Shaftesbury\nconceals his true beliefs in order to reach an audience that may not\nbe ready for the unadulterated, austere message of Stoicism. According\nto this interpretation, for instance, Shaftesbury\u2019s real view is\nthat aesthetic beauty (the beauty of physical things, such as art) is\nof no value. He only brings aesthetic beauty into his discussion as a\ndecoy or sugar-coating, a ploy to induce a wider audience toward a\nmoral position that would have left them cold if it had been delivered\nunadorned (see Tiffany 1923; Derhmann 2014; Stuart-Buttle 2019).\n\nAn alternative explanation is that Shaftesbury used his unpublished\nnotebooks as a means to work on improving himself with Stoic ideas\nduring psychologically fraught times, but that those notebooks do not\nnecessarily reflect the essence of his true philosophy (see Klein\n1994). The essays he worked hard to polish and publish as\nCharacteristicks might be a better reflection of his\nconsidered views. Another possibility is that he thought different\nthings at different times: the notebooks might accurately reflect a\nStoic orientation at some points in his life, but for all that he\nstill might have held non-Stoic ideas about aesthetics and public\nconcern at other points. In response, the strong Stoic interpretation\nmay contend that even in Characteristicks there are\nindications (esoteric perhaps, but evident to those who know where to\nlook) that seemingly non-Stoic ideas are but a decoy.\n",
