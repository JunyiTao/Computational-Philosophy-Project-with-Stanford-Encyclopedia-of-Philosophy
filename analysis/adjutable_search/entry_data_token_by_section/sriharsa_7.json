    "main_text": "Epistemology || Knowledge as Primitive\n2.4 Knowledge as Primitive\n\nThese problems are not the only problems that \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\nraises for various definitions of knowledge, but they are useful\ninsofar as they give us a clear understanding of what he takes to be\nan adequate definition of knowledge. He seems to think that a\ndefinition of knowledge should give us a unified decision procedure\nwhich will allow us to correctly predict whether any particular\nawareness-episode is an instance of knowledge without appealing back\nto the notion of knowledge itself. Moreover, insofar as he appeals to\nour intuitions about cases, he also seems to assume that this decision\nprocedure should respect (to some extent) our ordinary concept of\nknowledge. But one might respond to \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a by\npointing out that this approach only makes sense if we assume that the\nconcept of knowledge is analyzable in terms of more basic concepts\nthat do not refer back to knowledge. What if we deny this assumption\nand claim, with writers like Williamson (2000), that the ordinary\nconcept of knowledge is unanalyzable in that manner?\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a entertains a proposal that connects up nicely\nwith this question (KKh 245). He imagines an opponent who says\nthat\n\n\nknowledge v An awareness-episode\nconstitutes knowledge if and only if it is an instance of the natural\nkind property (j\u0101ti) knowledgehood.\n\n\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a is skeptical of the idea that knowledgehood\nis a natural kind property. But even if we set that topic aside, it is\nnot difficult to see that this proposal essentially seeks to avoid\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s objections against the definability\nof knowledge, by treating the concept of knowledge as unanalyzable in\nknowledge-independent terms.\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a imagines the defender of this proposal to be\nsomeone who thinks that our ordinary self-ascriptions of knowledge\nreliably track the presence of knowledgehood in various\nawareness-episodes. But this can only be the case if there is some\nkind of causal connection between knowledgehood and our\nself-ascriptions of knowledge, i.e., if knowledgehood causally\nregulates our self-ascriptions of knowledge. But surely,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a argues, knowledgehood can only give rise to\nself-ascriptions of knowledge insofar as we are aware that\nknowledgehood is instantiated in various awareness-episodes. When we\nsincerely say that some awareness-episode constitutes knowledge, we\nhave to be antecedently aware of knowledgehood as\ninstantiated in that awareness-episode.\n\nThen, the question will be: How do we determine whether an\nawareness-episode is an instance of knowledgehood? Even when the\nawareness-episode is our own, we cannot ascertain whether it is\nknowledge by introspection alone; for, even though we may be aware of\nan awareness-episode by introspection, we could still doubt or be\nmistaken as to whether it is knowledge. So, it seems that we can only\ndetermine whether an awareness-episode constitutes knowledge by means\nof inference on the basis of some kind of symptom. Are there\nmany such symptoms or one? If there is just one symptom distinct from\nknowledgehood, we should just treat that as the defining property of\nknowledge; so, defining knowledge in terms of knowledgehood makes no\nsense. But if there are many such symptoms, we need to say which ones\nthey are; for \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a has already argued that the\nwidely accepted definitions of knowledge are inadequate and therefore\ncannot be reliable symptoms of knowledge.\n\nThe upshot is this. Anyone who defines knowledge in terms of\nknowledgehood and therefore abandons the project of defining knowledge\nin knowledge-independent terms cannot offer any satisfactory story\nabout how we in fact ascribe knowledgehood to various\nawareness-episodes. In the absence of such a story, there is no reason\nto think that there is a genuine property of knowledgehood that we are\ntracking through our practices of knowledge-attribution. Thus, the\nproject of defining knowledge in terms of knowledgehood fails.\n",
