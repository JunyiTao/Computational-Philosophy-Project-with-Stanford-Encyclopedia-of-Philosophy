    "main_text": "The ontology of concepts || Concepts as abilities\n1.2 Concepts as abilities\n\nAccording to the abilities view, it\u2019s wrong to maintain that\nconcepts are mental particulars\u2014concepts are neither mental\nimages nor word-like entities in a language of thought. Rather,\nconcepts are abilities that are peculiar to cognitive agents (e.g.,\nDummett 1993, Bennett & Hacker 2008, Kenny 2010). The concept CAT,\nfor example, might amount to the ability to discriminate cats from\nnon-cats and to draw certain inferences about cats.\n\nWhile the abilities view is maintained by a diverse group of\nphilosophers, the most prominent reason for adopting the view is a\ndeep skepticism about the existence and utility of mental\nrepresentations, skepticism that traces back Ludwig Wittgenstein\n(1953/1958). One of the most influential arguments along these lines\nclaims that mental representations are explanatorily idle because they\nreintroduce the very sorts of problems they are supposed to explain.\nFor example, Michael Dummett cautions against trying to explain\nknowledge of a first language on the model of knowledge of a second\nlanguage. In the case of a second language, it is reasonable to\nsuppose that understanding the language involves translating its words\nand sentences into words and sentences of one\u2019s first language.\nBut according to Dummett, one can\u2019t go on to translate words and\nsentences of one\u2019s first language into a prior mental language.\n\u201c[T]here is really no sense to speaking of a concept\u2019s\ncoming into someone\u2019s mind. All we can think of is some image\ncoming to mind which we take as in some way representing the concept,\nand this gets us no further forward, since we still have to ask in\nwhat his associating that concept with that image consists\u201d\n(Dummett 1993, p. 98). In other words, the mental representation\nitself is just another item whose significance bears explaining.\nEither we are involved in a vicious regress, having to invoke yet\nanother layer of representation (and so on indefinitely) or we might\nas well stop with the external language and explain its significance\ndirectly. (For critical discussion of this type of regress argument,\nsee Fodor 1975, Crane 2015, Laurence & Margolis 1997).\n\nNot surprisingly, critics of the abilities view argue in the other\ndirection. They note difficulties that the abilities view inherits by\nits rejection of mental representations. One is that the view is\nill-equipped to explain the productivity of thought; another is that\nit can say little about mental processes. And if proponents of the\nabilities view remain neutral about the existence of mental\nrepresentations, they open themselves to the criticism that\nexplication of these abilities is best given in terms of underlying\nmental representations and processes (see Fodor 1968 and Chomsky 1980\nfor general discussion of the anti-intellectualist tradition in the\nphilosophy of mind).\n",
