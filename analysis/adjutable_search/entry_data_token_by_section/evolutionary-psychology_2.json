    "main_text": "The Massive Modularity Hypothesis\n3. The Massive Modularity Hypothesis\n\nClaims that the mind has a modular architecture, and even massively\nmodular architecture, are widespread in cognitive science (see e.g.\nHirshfield and Gelman 1994). The massive modularity thesis is first\nand foremost a thesis about cognitive architecture. As defended by\nevolutionary psychologists, the thesis is also about the source of our\ncognitive architecture: the massively modular architecture is the\nresult of natural selection acting to produce each of the many modules\n(see e.g. Barrett and Kurzban 2006; Barrett 2012). Our cognitive\narchitecture is composed of computational devices, that are innate and\nare adaptations (cf. Samuels 1998; Samuels et al. 1999a; Samuels et\nal. 1999b; Samuels 2000). This massively modular architecture accounts\nfor all of our sophisticated behavior. Our successful navigation of\nthe world results from the action of one or more of our many\nmodules.\n\nJerry Fodor was the first to mount a sustained philosophical defense\nof modularity as a theory of cognitive architecture (Fodor 1983). His\nmodularity thesis is distinct from the massive modularity thesis in a\nnumber of important ways. Fodor argued that our \u201cinput\nsystems\u201d are modular\u2014for example, components of our visual\nsystem, our speech detection system and so on\u2014these parts of our\nmind are dedicated information processors, whose internal make-up is\ninaccessible to other related processors. The modular detection\nsystems feed output to a central system, which is a kind of inference\nengine. The central system, on Fodor\u2019s view is not modular.\nFodor presents a large number of arguments against the possibility of\nmodular central systems. For example, he argues that central systems,\nto the extent that they engage in something like scientific\nconfirmation, are \u201cQuinean\u201d in that \u201cthe degree of\nconfirmation assigned to any given hypothesis is sensitive to\nproperties of the entire belief system\u201d (Fodor 1983, 107). Fodor\ndraws a bleak conclusion about the status of cognitive science from\nhis examination of the character of central systems: cognitive science\nis impossible. So on Fodor\u2019s view, the mind is partly modular\nand the part of the mind that is modular provides some subject matter\nfor cognitive science.\n\nA distinct thesis from Fodor\u2019s, the massive modularity thesis,\ngets a sustained philosophical defense from Peter Carruthers (see\nespecially Carruthers 2006). Carruthers is well aware that Fodor (see\ne.g. Fodor 2000) does not believe that central systems can be modular\nbut he presents arguments from evolutionary psychologists and others\nthat support the modularity thesis for the whole mind. Perhaps one of\nthe reasons that there is so much philosophical interest in\nevolutionary psychology is that discussions about the status of the\nmassive modularity thesis are highly\n theoretical.[3]\n Both evolutionary psychologists and philosophers present and consider\narguments for and against the thesis rather than simply waiting until\nthe empirical results come in. Richard Samuels (1998) speculates that\nargument rather than empirical data is relied on, because the various\ncompeting modularity theses about central systems are hard to pull\napart empirically. Carruthers exemplifies this approach as he relies\nheavily on arguments for massive modularity often at the expense of\nspecific empirical results that tell in favor of the thesis.\n\nThere are many arguments for the massive modularity thesis. Some are\nbased upon considerations about how evolution must have acted; some\nare based on considerations about the nature of computation and some\nare versions of the poverty of the stimulus argument first presented\nby Chomsky in support of the existence of an innate universal grammar.\n(See Cowie 1999 for a nice presentation of the structure of poverty of\nthe stimulus arguments.) Myriad versions of each of these arguments\nappear in the literature and many arguments for massive modularity mix\nand match components of each of the main strands of argumentation.\nHere we review a version of each type of argument.\n\nCarruthers presents a clear outline of the first type of argument\n\u201cthe biological argument for massive modularity\u201d:\n\u201c(1) Biological systems are designed systems, constructed\nincrementally. (2) Such systems, when complex, need to have massively\nmodular organization. (3) The human mind is a biological system and is\ncomplex. (4) So the human mind will be massively modularly in its\norganization\u201d (Carruthers 2006, 25). An example of this argument\nis to appeal to the functional decomposition of organisms into organs\n\u201cdesigned\u201d for specific tasks, e.g. hearts, livers,\nkidneys. Each of these organs arises as a result of natural selection\nand the organs, acting together, contribute to the fitness of the\norganism. The functional decomposition is driven by the response to\nspecific environmental stimuli. Rather than natural selection acting\nto produce general purpose organs, each specific environmental\nchallenge is dealt with by a separate mechanism. All versions of this\nargument are arguments from analogy, relying on the key transitional\npremise that minds are a kind of biological system upon which natural\nselection acts.\n\nThe second type of argument makes no appeal to biological\nconsiderations whatsoever (although many evolutionary psychologists\ngive these arguments a biological twist). Call this the computational\nargument, which unfolds as follows: minds are computational problem\nsolving devices; there are specific types of solutions to specific\ntypes of problems; and so for minds to be (successful) general problem\nsolving devices, they must consist of collections of specific problem\nsolving devices, i.e. many computational modules. This type of\nargument is structurally similar to the biological argument (as\nCarruthers points out). The key idea is that there is no sense to the\nidea of a general problem solver and that no headway can be made in\ncognitive science without breaking down problems into their component\nparts.\n\nThe third type of argument involves a generalization of\nChomsky\u2019s poverty of the stimulus argument for universal\ngrammar. Many evolutionary psychologists (see e.g. Tooby and Cosmides\n1992) appeal to the idea that there is neither enough time, nor enough\navailable information, for any given human to learn from scratch to\nsuccessfully solve all of the problems that we face in the world. This\nfirst consideration supports the conclusion that the underlying\nmechanisms we use to solve the relevant problems are innate (for\nevolutionary psychologists \u201cinnate\u201d is usually\ninterchangeable with \u201cproduct of natural\n selection\u201d[4]).\n If we invoke this argument across the whole range of problem sets\nthat humans face and solve, we arrive at a huge set of innate\nmechanisms that subserve our problem solving abilities, which is\nanother way of saying that we have a massively modular mind.\n\nThere are numerous responses to the many versions of each of these\ntypes of arguments and many take on the massive modularity thesis head\non without considering a specific argument for it. I will defer\nconsideration of responses to the first argument type until section 4\nbelow, which focuses on issues of the nature of evolution and natural\nselection \u2013 topics in philosophy of biology.\n\nThe second type of argument is one side of a perennial debate in the\nphilosophy of cognitive science. Fodor (2000, 68) takes this argument\nto rest on the unwarranted assumption that there is no\ndomain-independent criterion of cognitive success, which he thinks\nrequires an argument that evolutionary psychologists do not provide.\nSamuels (see esp. Samuels 1998) responds to evolutionary psychologists\nthat arguments of this type do not sufficiently discriminate between a\nconclusion about domain specific processing mechanisms and domain\nspecific knowledge or information. Samuels articulates what he calls\nthe \u201clibrary model of cognition\u201d in which there is domain\nspecific information or knowledge but domain general processing. The\nlibrary model of cognition is not massively modular in the relevant\nsense but type two arguments support it. According to Samuels,\nevolutionary psychologists need something more than this type of\nargument to warrant their specific kind of conclusion about massive\nmodularity. Buller (2005) introduces further worries for this type of\nargument by tackling the assumption that there can be no such thing as\na domain general problem solving mechanism. Buller worries that in\ntheir attempt to support this claim, evolutionary psychologists fail\nto adequately characterize a domain general problem solver. For\nexample, they fail to distinguish between a domain general problem\nsolver and a domain specific problem solver that is over generalized.\nHe offers the example of social learning as a domain general mechanism\nthat would produce domain specific solutions to problems. He uses a\nnice biological analogy to drive this point home: the immune system is\na domain general system in that it allows the body to respond to a\nwide variety of pathogens. While it is true that the immune system\nproduces domain specific responses to pathogens in the form of\nspecific antibodies, the antibodies are produced by one domain general\nsystem. These and many other respondents conclude that type two\narguments do not adequately support the massive modularity thesis.\n\nFodor (2000) and Kim Sterelny (2003) provide different responses to\ntype three arguments. Fodor\u2019s response is that poverty of the\nstimulus type arguments support conclusions about innateness but not\nmodularity and so these arguments can not be used to support the\nmassive modularity thesis. He argues that the domain specificity and\nencapsulation of a mechanism and its innateness pull apart quite\nclearly, allowing for \u201cperfectly general learning\nmechanisms\u201d that are innate and \u201cfully encapsulated\nmechanisms\u201d that are single stimulus specific and everything in\nbetween. Sterelny responds to the generalizing move in type three\narguments. He takes language to be the exception rather than the rule\nin the sense that while the postulation of an innate, domain specific\nmodule may be warranted to account for our language abilities, much of\nour other problem solving behavior can be accounted for without\npostulating such modules (Sterelny 2003,\n 200).[5]\n Sterelny\u2019s counter requires invoking alternate explanations for\nour behavioral repertoire. For example, he accounts for folk\npsychology and folk biology by appealing to environmental factors,\nsome of which are constructed by our forebears, that allow us to\nperform sophisticated cognitive tasks. If we can account for our\nsuccess at various complex problem solving tasks, without appealing to\nmodules, then the massive modularity thesis is undercut. Sterelny\nsharpens his response to massive modularity by adding more detail to\nhis accounts of how many of our uniquely human traits may have evolved\n(see e.g. Sterelny 2012). Sterelny introduces his \u201cevolved\napprentice\u201d model to account for the evolution of many human\ntraits that many assume require explanation in terms of massive\nmodularity, for example, forming moral judgments. Cecilia Heyes adopts\na similar approach to Sterenly in attacking massive modularity. Rather\nthan presenting arguments against massive modularity, she offers\nalternative explanations of the development of folk psychology that do\nnot rely on the massive modularity thesis (Heyes 2014a; Heyes\n2014b).\n\nHeyes and Sterelny not only reject massive modularity but also have\nlittle expectation that any modularity theses will bear fruit but\nthere are many critics of the massive modularity thesis who allow for\nthe possibility of some modularity of mind. Such critics of\nevolutionary psychology do not reject the possibility of any kind of\nmodularity, they just reject the massive modularity thesis. There is\nconsiderable debate about the status of the massive modularity thesis\nand some of this debate centers around the characterization of\nmodules. If modules have all the characteristics that Fodor (1983)\nfirst presented, then he may be right that central systems are not\nmodular. Both Carruthers (2006) and Barrett and Kurzban (2006) present\nmodified characterizations of modules, which they argue better serve\nthe massive modularity thesis. There is no agreement on a workable\ncharacterization of modules for evolutionary psychology but there is\nagreement on the somewhat benign thesis that \u201cthe language of\nmodularity affords useful conceptual groundwork in which productive\ndebates surrounding cognitive systems can be framed\u201d (Barrett\nand Kurzban 2006, 644).\n",
