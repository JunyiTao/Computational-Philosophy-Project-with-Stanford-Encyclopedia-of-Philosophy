    "main_text": "Mind\n8. Desire\n\n\nIn both perception and thinking, animal souls are in some ways\nactive and in some ways passive. Although both mind and the sensory\nfaculty receive their correlative forms when perceiving or thinking,\nneither is wholly passive in its defining activity. Perception involves\ndiscrimination, while thinking involves selective attending and\nabstraction, both activities, in the sense that each requires more than\nmere passive receptivity. Still, the sorts of activity required for\ncognition and perception do not explain in any obvious way another\ncentral fact about human beings and other animals: animals propel\nthemselves through space in pursuit of objects they desire. Even in his\nfirst characterizations of soul in De Anima, Aristotle is\nalive to the widely held conviction that the soul is implicated in\nmotion (De Animai 2, 405b11; i 5 409b19\u201324). Of course, this\nis a natural connection for him to make, given that every animate\nbeing, that is, every being with a soul, has within it a principle of\nmotion and rest. So, it seems deeply characteristic of living systems\nthat they are able to move themselves in ways likely to result in their\nsurvival and flourishing. Animals move themselves, however, in a\ndistinctive way: animals desire things, with the result that\ndesire is centrally implicated in all manner of animal action. Why did\nostrich run from the tiger? Because, one says easily, it desired to\nsurvive and so engaged in avoidance behavior. Why did the human being\ndrive to the opera and sit quietly in her seat? Because, it seems, she\ndesired to hear the music and to observe the spectacle.\n\n\nIn these, as in countless other cases, the explanation of animal\naction, human and non-human alike, easily and unreflectively appeals to\ndesire. This is why Aristotle does not end his De Anima with a\ndiscussion of mind. Instead, after discussing mind, he notes that all\nanimals are capable of locomotion, only to deny that any one of the\nfaculties of the soul so far considered (viz. nutrition, perception, or\nmind) can account for desire-initiated movement. Although he had\ninitially identified only these three faculties of soul (De\nAnima ii 2, 413b12), Aristotle now notes that something must\nexplain the fact that animals engage in goal-directed behavior in order\nto achieve their conscious and unconscious goals. The wanted\nexplanation cannot, he urges, be found somehow in the nutritive\nfaculty, since plants, as living beings, have that power of soul, but\ndo not move themselves around in pursuit of their goals; nor is it due\nto perception, since even some animals have this faculty without ever\nmoving themselves at all, in any way (Aristotle evidently has in mind\nsponges, oysters, and certain testacea, Historia Animalium i\n1, 487b6\u20139; viii 1 588b12; Partibus Animalium iv 5, 681b34,\n683c8); nor again can it be a product of mind, since insofar as it is\ncontemplative, mind does not focus upon objects likely to issue in\ndirectives for action, and insofar as it does commend action, mind is\nnot of itself sufficient to engender motion, but instead relies upon\nappetite (De Anima iii 9, 432b14\u201333a5). Indeed, using the same\nform of reasoning, that a faculty cannot account for purposive action\nif its activity is insufficient to initiate motion, Aristotle initially\nconcludes that even desire itself (orexis) cannot be\nresponsible for action. After all, continent people, unlike those who\nare completely and virtuously moderate, have depraved desires but do\nnot, precisely because they are continent, ever act upon them (De\nAnima iii 9 433a6\u20138; cf. Nicomachean Ethics i 13,\n1102b26). So their desires are insufficient for action. Consequently,\nhe concludes, desire alone, considered as a single faculty, cannot\nexplain purposive action, at least not completely.\n\n\nUltimately, though, Aristotle does come to the conclusion that there\nis a faculty of desire (orektikon) whose occupation it is to\ninitiate animal motion. (Perhaps his initial reservations pertained\nonly to one species of desire considered in isolation.) In any case, he\nsays plainly: \u201cIt is manifest, therefore, that what is called\ndesire is the sort of faculty in the soul which initiates\nmovement\u201d (De Anima iii 10, 433a31\u2013b1). He understands\nthis conclusion, however, in tandem with another which also serves as a\nqualification of his earlier finding that mind cannot be the source of\nmotion. He holds, in fact, that it is reasonable to posit two faculties\nimplicated in animal movement: desire and practical reason (De\nAnima iii 10, 433a17\u201319), though they do not work in isolation\nfrom one another. Rather, practical reason, broadly construed to\nincorporate the kind of image-processing present in non-human animals,\nis a source of movement when it focuses upon an object of desire as\nsomething desirable. So, practical reason and desire act corporately as\nthe sources of purposive motion in all animals, both human and\nnon-human (De Anima iii 10, 433a9\u201316), even though,\nultimately, it is desire whose objects prick practical intellect and\nset it in motion (De Anima iii 10, 433a17\u20132). For this reason,\nAristotle concludes, there is a faculty of desire whose activities and\nobjects are primarily, if not autonomously or discretely, responsible\nfor initiating end-directed motion in animals. What animals seek in\naction is some object of desire which is or seems to them to be\ngood.\n\n\nAristotle displays some hesitation in his discussion of desire and\nits relation to practical reason in the aetiology of animal action.\nSome have consequently concluded that his treatment can be regarded as\nat best inchoate or, worse, as positively befuddled. There seem to be\nno grounds for any such harsh assessment, however. Equally likely is\nthat Aristotle is simply sensitive to the complexities involved in any\napproach to the intertwining issues in the philosophy of action. Unlike\nsome later Humeans, he evidently appreciates that the data and\nphenomena in this domain are unstable, wobbling and retreating at the\napproach of taxonomizing theory. The antecedents of action, he rightly\nconcludes, involve some sort of faculty of desire; but he is reluctant\nto conclude that desire is the sole or sufficient faculty implicated in\nthe explanation of purposive behavior. In some way, he concludes,\npractical reason and imagination have indispensable roles to play as\nwell.\n",
