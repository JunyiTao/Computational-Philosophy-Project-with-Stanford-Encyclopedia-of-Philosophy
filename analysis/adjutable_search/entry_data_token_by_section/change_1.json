    "main_text": "Change, Cause, Time, Motion\n2. Change, Cause, Time, Motion\n\n\nOur interest in this essay will be on the special case of temporal\nchange. So construed, the notion of change is obviously bound up with\nnotions of cause, time and motion. Now a distinction between change\nand cause can certainly be drawn. It is clear that uncaused change is\nconceptually possible, and arguably actual in such things as\nradioactive decay. Conversely, the operation of a sustaining cause\nresults in no change in a thing, if the thing would otherwise be\nundergoing a change which the sustaining cause prevents. Hence, the\noperation of a cause on a thing is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor change in that thing. Accordingly, we put the topic of cause in\nthe background when discussing change.\n\n\nTime cannot be so backgrounded. The thesis that time could pass\nwithout change in anything at all has proved controversial, and we\nhave adopted the usage that change in a thing implies the passage of\ntime. Aristotle nonetheless argued that change is distinct from time\nbecause change occurs at different rates, whereas time does not\n(Physics IV,10). This essay focusses on the topic of change,\nwhile not denying that the topic of time is inseparable from\nit. Motion, as change in place, will figure prominently in our\ndiscussion.\n\n\nOne well-known idea is that of Cambridge change. This can be arrived\nat by following the well-tried analytical technique of re-casting\nphilosophically important discussions and concepts in the\nmeta-language. Thus a Cambridge change in a thing is a change in the\ndescriptions (truly) borne by the thing. The phrase \u201cCambridge\nchange\u201d seems to be due to Geach (1969, 71\u20132), who so named it\nto mark its employment by great Cambridge philosophers such as\nRussell and McTaggart. It is apparent that Cambridge change includes\nall cases ordinarily thought of as change, such as change of colour,\nfrom \u201cred\u201d to \u201cnon-red.\u201d But it also includes\nchanges in the relational predicates of a thing, such as when I\nchange from having \u201cnon-brother\u201d true of me to having\n\u201cbrother\u201d true of me, just when my mother gives birth to a\nsecond son. It might seem faintly paradoxical that there need be no\n(other) changes in me (height, weight, colouring, memories,\ncharacter, thoughts) in this circumstance, but it is simply a\nconsequence of the above piece of metalinguistic ascent. It does\npoint up, though, that in attempting to capture the object-language\nconcept, one should take note of the distinction between the monadic\nor internal or intrinsic properties of a thing, and its relations or\nexternal or extrinsic features. Thus the natural view of change is\nthat real, metaphysical change in a thing would be change in the\nmonadic or internal or intrinsic properties of the thing. We will\nreturn to this point in Section 5.\n",
