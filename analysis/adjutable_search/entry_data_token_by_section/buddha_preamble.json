These teachings, preserved in\ntexts known as the Nik\u0101yas or \u0100gamas,\nconcern the quest for liberation from suffering. While the ultimate\naim of the Buddha\u2019s teachings is thus to help individuals attain\nthe good life, his analysis of the source of suffering centrally\ninvolves claims concerning the nature of persons, as well as how we\nacquire knowledge about the world and our place in it. These teachings\nformed the basis of a philosophical tradition that developed and\ndefended a variety of sophisticated theories in metaphysics and\nepistemology.\n",
