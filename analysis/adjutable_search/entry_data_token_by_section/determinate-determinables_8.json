    "main_text": "Contemporary accounts of determinables and determinates || Preliminary motivations for the existence and irreducibility of determinables\n3.1 Preliminary motivations for the existence and irreducibility of determinables\n\nThere are perceptual, scientific, causal, semantic, and metaphysical\nconsiderations weighing in prima facie favor of determinables\u2019\nexisting and moreover being metaphysically irreducible to\ndeterminates. Again, these motivations are preliminary; as we\u2019ll\nsee down the line, anti-realists and reductionists take there to be\ngood reasons to resist taking the seeming appearances of existence\nand/or irreducibility at face value\n (see \u00a73.2).\n3.1.1 Determinables as perceived\n\nPerception provides one source of prima facie support for there being\nirreducible determinables. The best such motivations are indirect,\nsince bare claims that we can perceive determinables as distinct from\ndeterminates are\n disputable.[12]\n One such indirect motivation appeals to Sorites phenomena as\nindicating that we fail to perceive fully determinate instances of\nmany properties, including colors, tones, and textures. As Fales puts\nit:\n\n\n[This] is a conclusion which seems forced upon us by the fact that\neach member of a series of colors, etc., may be perceptually\nindistinguishable from its immediate neighbors but easily\ndistinguishable from more distant members of the series. (1990:\n 172)[13]\n\n\nSuch a conclusion supports not just the existence but also the\nirreducibility of determinables, since candidate reductions of\ndeterminables (to, e.g., disjunctions of associated determinates)\nappear to entail that any instance of a determinable is in fact an\ninstance of a (say, disjunct) determinate; but in that case\nneighbouring patches in a Sorites series would be perceptually\ndistinguishable, which they aren\u2019t.\n\nA second indirect perceptual motivation for irreducible determinables\nreflects that our perception of macro-objects typically fails to\nregister micro-determinate details. For example, shape is a\nparadigmatic determinable, but we do not perceive the shapes of trees,\ntables, and the like, in fully determinate microscopic detail (see\nHellie 2005, Stazicker 2016). In re this and the Sorites motivation,\nit is worth noting that even if perceived objects are themselves\nmaximally determinate, perceptual experience may still motivate\nirreducible determinables. As Wilson observes:\n\n\nPerhaps the (instances of) properties perceived are really maximally\ndeterminate, and only perceptual features or modes of presentation are\ndeterminable; but features of perceptual experience are also aspects\nof reality, so the larger point remains. (2012: 5)\n\n\nA third indirect perceptual motivation for irreducible determinables\nis that these best explain our being able to perceive that different\ndeterminates are similar in the relevant determinable respect. Hence\nFales suggests that since we are able \u201cto notice or be aware\nof\u201d the similarity between different shades of red, \u201cit\nseems clear that red is observable every time we observe an instance\nof a shade of red, even though it is not separable from that shade,\nbut is in the shade\u201d (1990: 172).\n3.1.2 Determinables as scientific posits\n\nBoth fundamental physical and special-scientific posits and laws\nappear to be characterized, at least in part, in determinable terms.\nAs Armstrong (1997) and French (2014) observe, it is natural to see\nfundamental physical laws as relating determinables, such as mass and\ncharge, or to themselves be determinable\n relations.[14]\n Special science laws are also naturally seen as involving features\nwhich are determinable in not being maximally precise; for example,\nthe features of aggregates relevant to thermodynamics and statistical\nmechanics average over features of the lower-level entities composing\nthe aggregate, and morphological and physiological features of plants\nand animals are characterized in determinable or functional terms,\nagain abstracting from micro-physical details. Relatedly, that special\nscience features abstract from micro-physical details enters into\nvarious arguments for these being irreducible (see, e.g., Batterman\n1998, Wilson 2010). More generally, the posit of existing and\nirreducible determinables in both fundamental and special sciences is\nin line with a principle of explanation pervasive in the sciences,\naccording to which good explanations do not cite unnecessary details\n(see, e.g., Strevens\n 2004).[15]\n3.1.3 Determinables as causally unspecific\n\nDeterminables appear to be causally unspecific, in having fewer\npowers\u2014in being able to contribute to causing fewer effects, in\nthe circumstances\u2014than their associated determinates. For\nexample, red has the power to get Sophie the pigeon, who\npecks at any red thing, to peck; but red doesn\u2019t have\nthe power to get Sophie\u2019s picky cousin Alice, who pecks only at\nscarlet patches, to peck; for a red patch might be not scarlet, but\nsome other shade of red\u2014say, burgundy (see Yablo 1992, Wilson\n1999, and Shoemaker 2001). Such a lack of causal specificity, combined\nwith a principle of individuation of scientific properties according\nto which they are (perhaps only contingently) distinguished by\ndifferent sets of powers, has been taken to support not just the\nexistence but the irreducibility of determinable features. For\nexample, since instances of disjunctive properties are identical to\ninstances of their disjuncts, reducing determinables to disjunctions\nof associated determinates would render determinable instances as\ncausally specific as determinate instances, and so fail to accommodate\nthe seeming causal unspecificity of determinables.\n3.1.4 Determinables as semantic referents\n\nOn a simple and in some sense default semantics, a sentence of the\nform \u2018\\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\u2019 is true just in case the entity\npicked out by \\(a\\) has the property picked out by \\(F\\). Hence if\n\u2018This ruby is red\u2019 is true then on the default semantics\nthe predicate \u2018red\u2019 refers to the determinable\nred. Irreducibility might moreover be motivated (see Rosen\n2010:128) by noting that a speaker may be competent with a\ndeterminable predicate without being familiar with all the associated\ndeterminates (as reductions of determinables to logical constructions\nof determinates might be thought to require).\n3.1.5 Determinables as a basis for similarity among determinates\n\nAs previously, one motivation for determinables is as providing a\nmetaphysical basis for perceived similarity among determinates\n(Johansson 2000). More generally, determinables may be considered\n\u2018natural\u2019 in the \u2018joint-carving\u2019 sense of\nLewis (1983) in virtue of providing a non-gerrymandered basis for\nobjective similarity among determinates (Wilson 2012).\n\nAgain, each of the motivations in (3.1.1) \u2013 (3.1.5) is\npreliminary. If the seeming appearance of there being irreducible\ndeterminables can be defended against objections, however, the\nphilosophical work these can do in encoding distinctively unspecific\naspects of reality (as per the applications in\n \u00a75)\n would constitute additional positive support for their posit.\n",
