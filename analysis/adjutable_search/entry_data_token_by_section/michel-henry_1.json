Phenomenology of Life and the Concept of Transcendental Affectivity\n\nSince the publication of the Essence of Manifestation in\n1963, Henry\u2019s entire oeuvre was devoted to the systematic\ndevelopment of a phenomenology that, while constituting itself within\nthe phenomenological tradition, criticizes substantially not only\nclassical Husserlian phenomenology but also the works of some of\nHusserl\u2019s most famous successors: Heidegger, Sartre and\nMerleau-Ponty. The originality of Henry\u2019s phenomenology lies in\nthe fact that it considers intentionality to be only one of two modes\nof appearing. In other words, Henry argues that the way in which\nphenomena appear to us cannot be restricted to the\n\u201cconsciousness of something\u201d as classical phenomenology\nwould suggest. On the contrary, for Henry, intentional consciousness\nmust be founded in a more fundamental mode of appearing that\nis precisely non- and even pre-intentional and that\ntherefore essentially differs from intentionality. It is this\nfundamental mode of appearing that Henry designates as\n\u201caffectivity\u201d, \u201cpathos\u201d or\n\u201clife\u201d.\n",
