    "main_text": "Two Kinds of Theory of Meaning\n1. Two Kinds of Theory of Meaning\n\nIn \u201cGeneral Semantics\u201d, David Lewis wrote\n\n\nI distinguish two topics: first, the description of possible languages\nor grammars as abstract semantic systems whereby symbols are\nassociated with aspects of the world; and, second, the description of\nthe psychological and sociological facts whereby a particular one of\nthese abstract semantic systems is the one used by a person or\npopulation. Only confusion comes of mixing these two topics. (Lewis\n1970: 19)\n\n\nLewis was right. Even if philosophers have not consistently kept these\ntwo questions separate, there clearly is a distinction between the\nquestions \u201cWhat is the meaning of this or that symbol (for a\nparticular person or group)?\u201d and \u201cIn virtue of what facts\nabout that person or group does the symbol have that\nmeaning?\u201d\n\nCorresponding to these two questions are two different sorts of theory\nof meaning. One sort of theory of meaning\u2014a semantic\ntheory\u2014is a specification of the meanings of the words and\nsentences of some symbol system. Semantic theories thus answer the\nquestion, \u201cWhat is the meaning of this or that\nexpression?\u201d A distinct sort of theory\u2014a foundational\ntheory of meaning\u2014tries to explain what about some person\nor group gives the symbols of their language the meanings that they\nhave. To be sure, the shape of a correct semantic theory places\nconstraints on the correct foundational theory of meaning, and vice\nversa; but that does not change the fact that semantic theories and\nfoundational theories are simply different sorts of theories, designed\nto answer different questions.\n\nTo see the distinction between semantic theories and foundational\ntheories of meaning, it may help to consider an analogous one. Imagine\nan anthropologist specializing in table manners sent out to observe a\ndistant tribe. One task the anthropologist clearly might undertake is\nto simply describe the table manners of that tribe\u2014to describe\nthe different categories into which members of the tribe place actions\nat the table, and to say which sorts of actions fall into which\ncategories. This would be analogous to the task of the philosopher of\nlanguage interested in semantics; her job is say what different sorts\nof meanings expressions of a given language have, and which\nexpressions have which meanings.\n\nBut our anthropologist might also become interested in the nature of\nmanners; he might wonder how, in general, one set of rules of table\nmanners comes to be the system of etiquette governing a particular\ngroup. Since presumably the fact that a group obeys one system of\netiquette rather than another is traceable to something about that\ngroup, the anthropologist might put his new question by asking, \n\n\nIn virtue of what facts about a person or group does that person or\ngroup come to be governed by a particular system of etiquette, rather\nthan another? \n\n\nOur anthropologist would then have embarked upon the analogue of the\nconstruction of a foundational theory of meaning: he would then be\ninterested, not in which etiquette-related properties particular\naction types have in a certain group, but rather the question of how\naction-types can, in any group, come to acquire properties of this\n sort.[1]\n Our anthropologist might well be interested in both sorts of\nquestions about table manners; but they are, pretty clearly, different\nquestions. Just so, semantic theories and foundational theories of\nmeaning are, pretty clearly, different sorts of theories.\n\nThe term \u201ctheory of meaning\u201d has, in the recent history of\nphilosophy, been used to stand for both semantic theories and\nfoundational theories of meaning. As this has obvious potential to\nmislead, in what follows I\u2019ll avoid the term which this article\nis meant to define and stick instead to the more specific\n\u201csemantic theory\u201d and \u201cfoundational theory of\nmeaning\u201d. \u201cTheory of meaning\u201d simpliciter\ncan be understood as ambiguous between these two\ninterpretations.\n\nBefore turning to discussion of these two sorts of theories, it is\nworth noting that one prominent tradition in the philosophy of\nlanguage denies that there are facts about the meanings of linguistic\nexpressions. (See, for example, Quine 1960 and Kripke 1982; for\ncritical discussion, see Soames 1997.) If this sort of skepticism\nabout meaning is correct, then there is neither a true semantic theory\nnor a true foundational theory of meaning to be found, since the\nrelevant sort of facts simply are not around to be described or\nanalyzed. Discussion of these skeptical arguments is beyond the scope\nof this entry, so in what follows I\u2019ll simply assume that\nskepticism about meaning is false.\n",
