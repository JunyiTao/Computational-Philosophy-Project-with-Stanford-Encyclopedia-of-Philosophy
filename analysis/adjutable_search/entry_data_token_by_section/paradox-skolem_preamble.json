    "main_text": "\n\n\nSkolem's Paradox involves a seeming conflict between two theorems\nfrom classical logic. The L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem says that if a\nfirst-order theory has infinite models, then it has models whose\ndomains are only countable. Cantor's theorem says that some sets are\nuncountable. Skolem's Paradox arises when we notice that the basic\nprinciples of Cantorian set theory\u2014i.e., the very principles used\nto prove Cantor's theorem on the existence of uncountable\nsets\u2014can themselves be formulated as a collection of first-order\nsentences. How can the very principles which prove the existence of\nuncountable sets be satisfied by a model which is itself only\ncountable? How can a countable model satisfy the first-order sentence\nwhich says that there are uncountably many mathematical\nobjects\u2014e.g., uncountably many real numbers?\n\n\nPhilosophical discussion of this paradox has tended to focus on\nthree main questions. First, there's a purely mathematical question:\nwhy doesn't Skolem's Paradox introduce an outright contradiction into\nset theory? Second, there's a historical question. Skolem himself gave\na pretty good explanation as to why Skolem's Paradox doesn't constitute\na straightforward mathematical contradiction; why, then, did Skolem and\nhis contemporaries continue to find the paradox so philosophically\ntroubling? Finally there's a purely philosophical question: what, if\nanything, does Skolem's Paradox tell us about our understanding of set\ntheory and/or about the semantics of set-theoretic language?\n",
