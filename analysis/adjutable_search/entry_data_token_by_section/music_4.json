    "main_text": "Musical Ontology || Higher-level Ontological Issues\n2.2 Higher-level Ontological Issues\n\nIt might seem that, since musical works are ontologically multiple,\nonce we have figured out their true nature, we will know what relation\nholds between the work and its performances, namely, whatever\nrelationship holds between entities of that kind and their instances.\nHowever, since the fundamentalist debate is about the basic\nontological category to which works belong, resolving that debate may\nleave open many questions about the relation between a work and its\nperformances. For instance, is the use of a harpsichord required to\ninstance Bach\u2019s Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in\nperformance? Would producing harpsichord-like sounds on a synthesizer\ndo just as well? What about using another keyboard instrument from\nBach\u2019s time, or a modern piano? Learning that musical works are,\nsay, eternal types will not necessarily help settle this issue of\n\u201cauthentic performance,\u201d which is perhaps the most\ndiscussed music-ontological issue, of interest to philosophers,\nmusicologists, musicians, and audiences alike. (For an excellent\noverview of the authentic performance debate, see S. Davies 2001:\n201\u201353. For an investigation of authenticity with respect to\nthings other than instantiation of the work, see Kivy 1995; Gracyk\n2001, 2009, 2017; Bicknell 2015; and Cray 2019.)\n\nThere have been two sources of widespread confusion in the debate over\nauthenticity in performance. One is a failure to recognize that\nauthenticity is not simply a property, but a relation that comes in\ndegrees and holds with respect to different aspects of its target.\nSomething may be more authentic in one regard and less authentic in\nanother (S. Davies 2001: 203\u20135). Another is the assumption that\nauthenticity is an evaluative concept, in the sense that\n\u201cauthentic\u201d implies \u201cgood.\u201d That this is not\nthe case is clear from the fact that an authentic murderer is not a\ngood thing (S. Davies 2001: 204). Thus, our value judgments will be\ncomplex functions of the extent to which we judge performances\nauthentic in various regards, and the values we assign to those\nvarious kinds of authenticity.\n\nThe central kind of authenticity that has been discussed is\nauthenticity with respect to the instantiation of the work. Most agree\nthat the fullest such authenticity requires the production of the\nright pitches and rhythms in the right order. (For skepticism based on\nthe history of the practice, see Dyck 2014; Ravasio 2019a; and the\ndiscussion in Dodd 2020b and Ravasio 2020.) Pure sonicists\nargue that this is sufficient (e.g., Kivy 1988a). Timbral\nsonicists argue that these pitches must also have timbres\nreflecting the composer\u2019s instrumentation (e.g., Dodd 2007:\n201\u201339). Instrumentalists argue that such sounds must\nbe produced on the kinds of instruments specified in the score (e.g.,\nLevinson 1990c). Much of the debate is over what kinds of aesthetic or\nartistic properties are essential to musical works. If the limpid\ntextures of Bach\u2019s Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 are\nessential to it, then one cannot authentically instance the work using\na grand piano instead of a harpsichord. As such, the debate reflects a\nwider one in aesthetics, musical and otherwise, between\nformalists (or empiricists, or structuralists), who believe\nthat the most important properties of a work are intrinsic ones,\naccessible to listeners unaware of the historical and artistic context\nin which it was created, and contextualists, who believe that\na work is essentially tied to its context of creation. Stephen Davies\nhas argued for a strong contextualism, claiming that one cannot give a\nsingle answer to the question of whether particular instrumentation is\nrequired for the fully authentic instantiation of a work. Works can be\nontologically \u201cthicker\u201d or \u201cthinner\u201d as a\nresult of the specifications of a composer working within certain\nconventions (1991, 2001). The more properties of a fully authentic\nperformance a particular work specifies, the thicker it is. Thus for\nsome works (typically earlier in the history of Western music)\ninstrumentation is flexible, while for others (e.g., Romantic\nsymphonies) quite specific instrumentation is required for fully\nauthentic performances.\n\nIn addition to the question of what constitutes authenticity, there\nhas been debate over its attainability and value. Those who question\nits attainability point to our historical distance from the creation\nof some works (Young 1988). We may no longer be able to read the\nnotation in which the work is recorded, or construct or play the\ninstruments for which it was written. If so, full authenticity is not\nattainable. But we rarely have no idea about these matters, and thus\nwe might achieve partial authenticity (S. Davies 2001: 228\u201334).\nThose who question the value of authenticity often target kinds other\nthan work-instantiation. For instance, one might question the value of\nproducing a performance that authentically captures the sound of\nperformances as they took place in the context of a work\u2019s\ncomposition, on the basis that musicians were not as highly skilled\nthen as now, for instance (Young 1988: 229\u201331). Such arguments,\nthough, have no consequences for the value of work-instantiation. Some\nargue that although we might attain an authentic instance of a work,\nthe idea that we might thereby hear the work as its contemporaries\nheard it is wishful thinking, since the musical culture in which we\nare immersed enforces ways of listening upon us that we cannot escape\n(Young 1988: 232\u20137). Thus the point of such authenticity is\nquestioned. In response, we may consider not only the possibility that\nwe are in a better position to appreciate historical works than\ncontemporary ones, but also the remarkable flexibility people seem to\nshow in enjoying many different kinds of music from throughout history\nand the world (S. Davies 2001: 234\u20137).\n\nJulian Dodd (2020a) argues that there is more than one way to be true\nto a musical work, and thus to produce an authentic performance: One\ncan comply with the score, or one can be true to the music\u2019s\noverall integrity or point (136). When the two conflict,\ninterpretive authenticity trumps score-compliance authenticity\n(147) because the fundamental norm of work-performance practice is to\nperform it in a way that evinces a subtle or profound understanding\nof it (163), while score compliance is valued only because it\ntends to lead to such performances. Andrew Kania responds that it is\nunclear whether, even by the lights of Dodd\u2019s own theory,\nDodd\u2019s central examples are cases of interpretive authenticity\ntrumping score compliance (Kania 2022: 131\u20132). More importantly,\nhe argues that Dodd\u2019s conception of the music\u2019s overall\nintegrity or point misses the importance of the surface-level\ndetails to a work\u2019s meaning or content. Kania suggests, instead,\nthat the fundamental norm of the practice is to evince an\nunderstanding of the work through complying with its\nscore (2022: 127, italics altered).\n\nMoving on from authenticity, a second area that may be independent of\nthe fundamentalist debate is that of comparative ontology. (For\ndispute over this framing issue, see Brown 2011, 2012.) Just as\nclassical works from different historical periods may be ontologically\ndiverse, so may works from different contemporary traditions. Theodore\nGracyk has argued that instances of works of rock music are not\nperformances. Rather, the work is instanced by playing a copy of a\nrecording on an appropriate device (1996; cf. Fisher 1998). Stephen\nDavies has argued that rock is more like classical music than Gracyk\nacknowledges, with works for performance at the heart of the\ntradition, albeit works for a different kind of performance (2001:\n30\u20136). Gracyk\u2019s view has been amplified and defended in\nattempts to find a place for composition, live performance, and\nperformance skill within his basic framework (Kania 2006, Bruno 2013,\nBartel 2017, Magnus 2022).\n\nWork on the ontology of jazz has centered on the nature of\nimprovisation, particularly the relation between improvisation and\ncomposition (Alperson 1984, 1998; Valone 1985; Brown 1996, 2000;\nHagberg 1998; Gould & Keaton 2000; Sterritt 2000; and Young &\nMatheson 2000; Bresnahan 2015; Love 2016; Magnus 2016). This has been\na useful reminder that not all music is the performance of\npre-composed works (Wolterstorff 1987: 115\u201329). However,\nimprovisation can occur within the context of such a work, as in the\nperformance of an improvised cadenza in a classical concerto. Some\nhave argued that there is not as significant a distinction between\nimprovisation and composition as is usually thought (Alperson 1984).\nOthers have argued that all performance requires improvisation (Gould\n& Keaton 2000). Yet others restrict the possibility of\nimprovisation to certain kinds of musical properties, such as\n\u201cstructural\u201d rather than \u201cexpressive\u201d ones\n(Young & Matheson 2000). However, none of these arguments are\ncompelling. Usually they turn on equivocal use of terms such as\n\u201ccomposition\u201d and \u201cperformance,\u201d or beg the\nquestion by defining improvisation in terms of deviation from a score\nor variation of a limited set of \u201cexpressive\u201d\nproperties.\n\nThough jazz is not necessarily improvisational, and very few jazz\nperformances lack any sort of prior compositional process, the\ncentrality of improvisation to jazz presents a challenge to the\nmusical ontologist. One might argue that jazz works are ontologically\nlike classical works\u2014composed for multiple, different\nperformances\u2014but that they tend to be thinner, leaving more room\nfor improvisation (Gould & Keaton 2000; Young & Matheson\n2000). The difficulty is to specify the work without conflating one\nwork with another, since tokening the melody may not be required, and\nmany works share the same harmonic structure. As a result, some argue\nthat the performance is itself the work (Alperson 1984; Hagberg 2002;\nS. Davies 2001: 16\u201319). One problem here is parity with\nclassical music. If jazz performances are musical works in their own\nright, it is difficult to deny that status to classical performances\nof works, yet this seems to multiply works beyond what we usually\nthink is necessary. A third possibility is that in jazz there are no\nworks, only performances (Brown 1996, 2000: 115; Kania 2011b). This is\ncounterintuitive if \u201cwork\u201d is an evaluative term, but it\nis not obvious that this is the case.\n\nJulian Dodd (2014a) argues that the kinds of considerations adduced in\nfavor of these views confuse questions of ontology with questions of\nvalue. Jazz is ontologically like early classical music, according to\nDodd: the focus of critical attention is the improvisatory performance\nrather than the composition it instantiates, but that composition is\nno less a musical work for that difference in critical emphasis. (See\nFisher 2018 for an attempted reconciliation.) Similar considerations\nmight be adduced against the increasingly complicated ontologies of\nrock referred to above. Such arguments return us to debates about the\nmethodology of musical ontology.\n",
