    "main_text": "Meaning and Truth || Truth\n2.2 Truth\n\n\nIn LTL Ayer, following Ramsey (as he thought, but see Field\n1986 for a dissenting view), put forward a redundancy (deflationary)\nview of truth: \u201c\u2026in all sentences of the form\n\u2018p is true\u2019, the phrase \u2018is true\u2019 is\nlogically superfluous\u201d (LTL p. 117). The function of\nsuch a phrase is simply to mark an assertion (or denial, in the case\nof \u2018is false\u2019), so there is no \u2018real\u2019 relation\nof truth, and so no problem of truth for philosophers to worry\nabout. Similarly, when we say a proposition is probable, or probably\ntrue, we are not assigning any intrinsic property to the proposition,\nnor saying that there is any relation it bears to any other\nproposition. We are simply expressing our confidence in that\nproposition, or, more accurately, it expresses the degree of\nconfidence it is rational to possess in the proposition.\n\n\nThis deflationary attitude to truth was supported by his\nverificationism about meaning; Ayer did not have to provide\ntruth-conditions for the meaning of sentences. Assertions had meaning\nin virtue of their verification conditions, and propositions were\ndefined just as an equivalence class of sentences with the same\nverification conditions.\n\n\nDeflationism about truth replaces a concern for a substantial theory\nof truth with a concern about which sentences, or utterances, are\ndeemed to be truth-apt. Ayer denied that moral utterances were\ntruth-apt. Given that he thought that asserting that p was\nequivalent to saying that p was true, he had to deny that\nmoral utterances could be assertions (see section 7).\n\n\nSee the entry\n on the deflationary theory of truth\n for further discussion.\n",
