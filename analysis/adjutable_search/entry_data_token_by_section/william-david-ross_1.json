    "main_text": "The Data of Ethics\n2. The Data of Ethics\n\nRoss attempts to develop an ethical framework that is faithful to and\nreflects the central \u2018moral convictions of thoughtful and\nwell-educated people\u2019 (RG 41; FE 1\u20135). These convictions\nconstitute, for Ross, \u201cthe data of ethics just as\nsense-perceptions are the data of a natural science\u201d (RG 41). At\nleast some of these moral convictions, Ross thinks, constitute\nknowledge the philosopher neither proves nor disproves (RG\n20\u201321n1, 40). An ethical theory should not, Ross contends,\nrepudiate these convictions \u2013 these facts \u2013 in an effort\nto simplify or systematize our moral thinking (RG 19, 40; FE 5,\n83).\n\nOn the face of it, Ross is at odds with moral philosophers like Henry\nSidgwick who take the systematization and correction of common-sense\nmorality as one of the main roles of ethical theorizing (Sidgwick\n1907: 77). Sidgwick, for example, holds that \u201cthe philosopher\nseeks unity of principle, and consistency of method\u201d (even if\nthis leads to revision of common-sense thinking) (Sidgwick 1907, 6)\nand that the role of the moral philosopher is to \u2018enunciate, in\nfull breadth and clearness, those primary intuitions of Reason, by the\nscientific application of which the common moral thought of mankind\nmay be at once systematised and corrected\u2019 (Sidgwick 1907,\n373\u201374).\n\nRoss does, of course, acknowledge errors exist in our moral thinking.\nIndeed, it is, he says, \u2018a mistake to assume that all . . .\n[our] convictions are true, or even that they are all consistent;\nstill more, to assume they are all clear\u2019 (FE 1). Like some\nsense perceptions in science, he says, some of our moral convictions\nmay have to be discarded as illusory (RG 41). They are not discarded\nat the behest of a theory. Instead, they are to be rejected, Ross\nsays, \u2018only when they are in conflict with other convictions\nwhich stand better the test of reflection\u2019 (RG 41). The aim of\nmoral philosophy is to compare our moral convictions with each other,\n\u2018and to study them in themselves, with a view to seeing which\nbest survive such examination, and which must be rejected either\nbecause in themselves they are ill-grounded, or because they\ncontradict other convictions that are better grounded; and to clear\nup, so far as we can, ambiguities that lurk in them\u2019 (FE 1; also\nFE 2\u20133, 190). \n\nRoss suggests most errors in our moral thinking concern media\naxiomata \u2013 or middle principles or rules \u2013 rather\nthan fundamental moral principles (FE 190; RG 20\u201321n1). However, he\nseems at times to consider reflective inquiry with the potential for\nrevisions of a more radical nature. He suggests, for example, inquiry\ninto the \u2018historical origin of\u2026[our moral] beliefs and\npractices\u2019 may show \u2018the most strongly felt repulsions\ntowards certain types of conduct are relics of a bygone system of\ntotems and fetishes, their connexion with which is little suspected by\nthose who feel them\u2019 (RG 13). An inquiry of this kind may lead\nto significant revision of even aspects of moral thinking thought to\nbe fundamental (Singer 2005). \n\nMoreover, Ross at times suggests he aims to reflect the views of the\n\u2018thoughtful and well-educated\u2019 (RG 41) or, what comes to\nthe same thing, what \u2018we\u2019 think (RG 40; FE 102, 104, 134,\n172). But at other times he says he aims to reflect the views of the\n\u2018plain man\u2019 (RG 17, 20\u201321n1, 28, 57; FE 186, 187,\n188; KT 31). If the views of the thoughtful and well-educated and the\nplain man are distinct, and Ross inclines (with some justification)\ntoward the former rather than the latter, his approach to moral\ntheorising may be closer on the matter of reform (though not of\nsystem) to Sidgwick\u2019s (which, to be clear, emphasises what we\nthink on reflection and the consensus of experts (Sidgwick 1907,\n338\u2013343)). This may cause Ross trouble. He faults rival moral views\nfor conflicting with what \u2018plain men\u2019 think about ethics.\nIf he is open to substantially revising the plain person\u2019s\nviews, he may weaken his case against rivals.\n\nIn any case, the novelty of Ross\u2019s moral outlook and its fit\nwith what the plain person thinks will emerge only once its content is\nfully specified. About the data Ross seeks to clarify and honour, a\nnumber of questions emerge. What is its precise content? How is it\nknown? What is its metaphysical status? Together with his fidelity to\nreflective moral attitudes, Ross\u2019s answers to these questions\nconstitute his unique contribution to moral philosophy.\n",
