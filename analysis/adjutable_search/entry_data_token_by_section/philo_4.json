    "main_text": "Philo and Philosophical Schools\n3. Philo and Philosophical Schools\n\nFor us it is clear that Philo never had a philosophical affiliation.\nTo say that he was a Pythagorean, a Platonist, or a Stoic would have\nbeen for him to admit that he sought truth in spaces outside the\nBible. Was he an Eclectic (Mansfeld 1988)? The concept of eclecticism\nis a complicated one. If it means that Philo used different\nphilosophers as sources of inspiration and expression in order to\nelaborate his work, this cannot be denied. On the other hand, if one\nmeans that he built a specific philosophical identity for himself by\nassociating with different doctrines, that seems far from the truth.\nIt would mean that he was in search of an autonomous ego, a\nperspective at odds with his denial of the possibility for an\nindividual to exist truly on his own, i.e., without God\u2019s help.\nMore exactly, if Philo asserted his own individuality, it was in the\nfree modification and criticism of all philosophical doctrines around\nhim, sometimes using them as their creators would never have imagined\npossible.\n",
