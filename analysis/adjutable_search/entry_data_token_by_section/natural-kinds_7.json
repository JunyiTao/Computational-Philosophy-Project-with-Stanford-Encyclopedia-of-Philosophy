The chemical\nelements and chemical compounds appear to be bona fide\nnatural kinds. We refer to chemical kinds in laws, explanations, and\ninductions: that a certain item is iron explains its behaviour and\nthat behaviour is predictable; that iron objects are magnetizable is a\nlaw of nature (criteria 2 and 3 above). Moreover, we can induce that\nall iron is magnetizable, from the observation of particular instances\nof iron objects that are magnetic. And chemical kinds appear to obey\nthe categorical distinctness requirement: iron is clearly distinct\nfrom its neighbours in the periodic table (manganese and cobalt); no\nelements are intermediate kinds (criterion 6 above). Furthermore,\nmicrostructural essentialism seems to be a prima facie\nplausible option for chemical kinds: it is essential to iron that\nsomething made of pure iron is constituted by atoms that have\nprecisely 26 protons in their nuclei.\n2.2.1 Microstructuralism\n\nMicrostructuralism in the philosophy of chemistry is the thesis that\nchemical kinds can be individuated solely in terms of their\nmicrostructural properties (Hendry 2006). As exemplified above by the\ncase of iron, the chemical elements provide paradigmatic kinds that\nmay be individuated microstructurally, since the atomic\nnumber\u2014the number of protons in the nucleus\u2014suffices to\nidentify the element. It is true that macro-level chemical and\nphysical properties can also serve to individuate chemical elements,\nand in the nineteenth century chemists were able to individuate\nelements without knowing what we do about nuclear structure. However,\nit is held that atomic number has explanatory priority: the number of\nprotons in the nucleus, and hence the nuclear charge, explains the\nstructure of electrons surrounding the nucleus, which, in turn,\nexplains the chemical behaviour of the element.\n\nThe microstructuralist can extend this approach from elements to\ncompounds. Compounds are identified principally by their constituent\nelements. Thus carbon dioxide is that compound of carbon and oxygen\nwith the molar proportion 1:2. In more detail, molecules of carbon\ndioxide consist of two oxygen atoms and a single carbon atom. The\npractice of identifying a chemical compound only by its composing\nelements was the norm in chemistry, until the discovery of isomerism\nby Friedrich Woehler in 1827. Isomers are distinct compounds that\nnonetheless share the same constituent elements in the same\nproportion. Thus fulminic acid and cyanic acid may both be expressed\nin terms of constituents in the empirical formula CHNO, but their\ndistinct chemical and physical properties identify them as different\nsubstances. The explanation of isomerism (and many other facts in\norganic chemistry), provided first by August Kekul\u00e9 and\nArchibald Scott Couper, is the fact that certain compounds exist in\nmolecular form and these molecules have internal structure. Thus\nmolecules of isomers have the same atoms in different spatial\narrangements, e.g., CHNO may be arranged as H\u2013O\u2013C\u2261N\n(cyanic acid) or as H\u2013C=N\u2013O (fulminic acid). Isomerism\nmeans that specifying the chemical composition alone is not sufficient\nfor classification. The microstructure of a compound concerns not just\nthe elemental atoms in its molecules, but also their spatial\narrangement.\n\nNeedham (2000) and van Brakel (2000) have argued that compounds such\nas water are dynamic structures whose natures cannot be given in\nstatic accounts of their composing elements. Molecules of\nH2O are polar, with the consequence that the\nelectropositive hydrogen atoms in one H2O molecule will\nbond with the electronegative oxygen atoms in another H2O\nmolecule, such bonds being hydrogen bonds with the result\nthat in liquid water H2O molecules will form polymer-like\nchains known as oligomers. The hydrogen bonds and the\nconsequent chains are responsible for the fact that water is liquid at\nroom temperature (whereas compounds with similarly sized molecules,\nsuch as hydrogen sulphide, methane, and carbon dioxide, are all\ngaseous at room temperature). These oligomers are constantly forming,\nbreaking, and reforming. The rate of such changes and the mean length\nof such oligomers are dependent on the thermodynamic context (in the\nextreme case, an ice crystal may be considered as a single such\noligomer, the crystal structure being dependent on the fixed, strong\nhydrogen bonds). Thus, say Needham and van Brakel, we cannot consider\nwater to be just a compound composed of a collection of H2O\nmolecules. Furthermore, anything that is to be water must be a\nmacroscopic entity, since only macroscopic bodies can bear\nthermodynamic properties, such as melting point, which we use to\nidentify water. Hence, a single H2O molecule is not\nwater.\n\nThese considerations need not undermine the microstructuralist claim.\nMany chemical kinds may exist in any of the solid, liquid, and gaseous\nstates while remaining the same substance, including water. But, water\nvapour will not possess the oligomers present in liquid water and ice.\nSo their presence, however characteristic of water in the liquid and\nsolid phases, cannot be a necessary feature of all bodies of water.\nAbove we saw that atomic number is regarded as the essential feature\nof an element because it explains the other characteristics an element\nhas. Likewise, the structure of the H2O molecule explains\nwhy it is a strongly polar molecule, which in turn explains why it\ntends to form oligomers. As regards thermodynamic properties, Hendry\n(2006) points out that we say that water is contained in a\nperson\u2019s body, without thinking that this water has any\nthermodynamic properties. More generally, thermodynamic properties can\nbe ascribed only to entities in equilibrium, but not all bodies of\nwater are in thermodynamic equilibrium or even nearly so. We may very\nwell use such thermodynamic properties in identifying something as\nwater, but that does not mean that it is in virtue of such properties\nthat something is water.\n\nHendry (2006) points to a potentially more difficult problem, which is\nthat any liquid sample of water, however pure, contains not only\nH2O molecules but also H3O+ and\nOH\u2212 ions. These ions cannot be regarded as\nimpurities, since they are also an inevitable consequence of the polar\nstructure of the H2O molecule. Hendry\u2019s solution is\nto regard H2O molecules as the constituents of water in\nrather the same sense that eggs and flour are the constituents of a\ncake\u2014they go into making the cake but need not retain exactly\nthe form they started with. Water is made from bodies of\nH2O molecules, but not all those retain precisely that\nstructure.\n\nThe taxa in the classical Linnean system of biological classification\nare nested in a hierarchy, as required by Criterion 5 in Section\n1.1.1. But, in certain respects, chemical classification fails to meet\nthis requirement. The phenomenon of allotropy is exhibited\nwhen an element exists in two or more distinct forms. The element\ncarbon has several, including the allotropes diamond and graphite. Tin\nhas two allotropes at room tempreature, white tin (which is metallic)\nand grey tin (which is non-metallic). Some instances of tin will fall\ninto one category and other instances will fall into the other\ncategory. Consequently, classification by element and classification\nby metal or non-metal cannot be combined hierarchically.\n\nSuch cross-cutting classifications are frequently found in organic\nchemistry, where compounds can be classified according to their\nso-called functional groups. Functional groups are specific\ncombinations of atoms within a molecule that will cause the molecule\nto engage in certain reactions and to have other physical and chemical\nproperties that are characteristic of that group. For example,\nalcohols are organic compounds containing a hydroxyl group \u2212OH\nbound to a carbon atom of an alkyl group or derivative of an alkyl\ngroup. Alcohols undergo characteristic reactions such as\nesterification. Since other hydrogen atoms in an alcohol molecule may\nbe substituted by another functional group, the resulting molecule\nwill have properties characteristic of both functional groups and may\nbe classified accordingly. Benzyl alcohol,\nC6H5CH2OH (or BnOH), is obtained from\nmethane, CH4, by replacing one hydrogen atom by an\nalcohol-forming hydroxyl group, \u2212OH, and another by the phenyl\ngroup \u2212C6H5 (Ph) (the phenyl group plus\nthe CH2 from the methane is the benzyl group, i.e.\nBn is PhCH2). Thus benzyl alcohol may be classified either\nas an alcohol, or as an aromatic benzene derivative, since it\nparticipates in the characteristic reactions of the latter, such as\nelectrophilic aromatic substitution or hydrogenation of the benzene\nring. If the hierarchy requirement on a system of natural kinds is\ncorrect, then not all these cross-cutting classifications pick out\nnatural kinds. The claim that the hierarchy requirement is too\nstringent for scientific kinds has been defended by Khalidi (1998) and\nTobin (2010b).\n\nOne may have to deny that metals form a natural kind, and that\nclassification by functional group is a classification into natural\nkinds. (Not all classifications need to be into kinds in order for\nthem to be useful.) Note that in both cases, there is room for\nvagueness. Some elements, such as germanium and antimony, are classed\nas metalloids, with characteristics between metals and non-metals. The\nimpact of a functional group diminishes with the size of the molecules\nof which it is a part and in the presence of competing functional\ngroups, and so in certain cases, classification according to\nfunctional group will be vague. Such vagueness falls foul of the\ncategorical distinctness requirement (Criterion 6 above).\n\nPhilosophers have also discussed classification at the interface of\nbiology and chemistry. Goodwin (2011) has argued that structure is\nfundamental and sufficient for classification of biomolecules, such as\nproteins. Tobin (2010a) and Slater (2009) appeal to developments in\nthe relationship between protein structure and function in a number of\ncases such as moonlighting proteins, intrinsically unstructured\nproteins, and enzymes with multiple structural variants. They claim\nthat the path from structure to function in not straightforward and so\nundermines the fundamental individuating role of structure in protein\nclassification. Slater (2009) takes these developments in the practice\nto constitute an argument in favour of macromolecular pluralism.\nGoodwin (2011) claims that these developments do not undermine the\nfundamental role of structure in protein classification, but instead\nsuggest a more nuanced understanding of this role. (Goodwin, 2011: p.\n534) In a similar vein, Tahko (2020) argues that biochemical kinds\npose a challenge for ontological reductionism and for\nmicrostructuralism, which have led some to motivate a dual theory of\nchemical and biological kinds and others to argue for pluralism about\nnatural kinds. Tahko argues that the main challenge is multiple\nrealization, which he nevertheless, thinks can be addressed. The\nupshot is that there are reasonable prospects for ontological\nreductionism about biochemical kinds, which in his view corroborates\nnatural kind monism. Thus, even if there are indispensable\nclassificatory practices at the higher level, this need not entail\npluralism about biochemical kinds.\n",
