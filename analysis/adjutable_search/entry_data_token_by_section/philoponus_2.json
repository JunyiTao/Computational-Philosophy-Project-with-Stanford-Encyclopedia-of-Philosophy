    "main_text": "Extant Philosophical Commentaries || Theory of Light\n2.1 Theory of Light\n\n\nThe commentary on Aristotle\u2019s On the Soul is apparently the\nearliest to contain passages in which Philoponus  at times abandons\nconventional exegesis in order to criticize an Aristotelian doctrine, a\ntendency which becomes more and more conspicuous in the Physics\ncommentary, dated to 517.  Scholars now believe that at least some of\nthese deviations from commentary proper derive from later revisions\nof earlier expositions in the classroom.  One can distinguish between two kinds of\ncriticism: substantive modification of Aristotelian ideas on the one\nhand, and outright rejection on the other. Philoponus\u2019 commentary\nOn the Soul presents a good example of the former kind of\ncriticism. In On the Soul II 7 Aristotle takes light to be\nincorporeal, and he describes its appearance as an instantaneous\ntransition from the potentiality (d\u00fanamis) of a medium\nto be transparent to the actuality\n(en\u00e9rgeia) of transparency. At pp. 330ff of\nhis commentary, Philoponus offers a constructive kind of criticism\nthat seems to have had momentous consequences for his eventual\nconceptualization of the theory of the impetus (see below). Philoponus\ncontends that Aristotle\u2019s view fails to account both for the laws\nof optics and for the plain phenomenon that the region below the moon\nis warmed by the light of the sun, a celestial body. In an\nAristotelian spirit of modifying the theory so as to save the\nphenomena, he proceeds to re-interpret the term\nen\u00e9rgeia not as a state of actuality, but rather as an\n\u2018incorporeal activity\u2019 which, besides constituting the\ntransparency of the medium, is also capable of warming bodies. Philoponus argues that in the same way soul, as an incorporeal activity in the\nbody, causes the animal to be warm. Due to this novel interpretation\nof Aristotle\u2019s terminology, light is now understood not\nstatically but as something dynamic. And it is possible to trace\nPhiloponus\u2019 further development of the idea. In the\nMeteorology commentary, which belongs to a stage when\nPhiloponus had already abandoned the Aristotelian assumption of an immutable\ncelestial fifth element (ether), he argues that light and heat may be explained best as consequences of the nature of the sun, which is\nfire (In Meteor. 49). Heat, so he explains, is generated when the rays\nemanating from the sun are refracted and warm the air through\nfriction.\n",
