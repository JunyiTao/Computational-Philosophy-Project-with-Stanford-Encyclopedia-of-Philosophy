Holism, non-separability and action at a distance in quantum mechanics\n\n\nThe quantum realm as depicted by all the quantum theories that\npostulate non-locality, i.e., influences between distant (space-like\nseparated) systems, involves some type of non-separability or\nholism. In what follows in this section, we shall consider the nature\nof the non-separability and holism manifested by various\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics. On the basis of this\nconsideration, we shall address the question of whether these\ninterpretations predicate the existence of action at a distance.  We\nstart with the so-called \u2018collapse theories.\u2019\n",
