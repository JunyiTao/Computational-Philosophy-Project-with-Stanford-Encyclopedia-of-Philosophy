    "main_text": "\n\nSocial procedures that have algorithmic aspects can often be improved\nby redesign. This holds for voting and other peaceful decision making\nprocedures, for match-making, for auctioning, for fair division of\nestates, and for many procedures of distributive justice. The\nalgorithmic aspects can be analyzed with formal methods. The term\n\u201csocial software\u201d was coined by Rohit Parikh (2002)\nfor the emerging interdisciplinary\nenterprise that is concerned with the design and analysis of\nalgorithms that regulate social processes. Such analysis and\n(re-)design uses methods from logic, game theory and theoretical\ncomputer\n science.[1]\n The goals of research in formal approaches to social procedures are\nmodeling social situations, developing theories of correctness, and\n(re-)designing social procedures, ideally leading to new social\nbehavior.\n\nLogic, game theory and computer science are not the only disciplines\nthat have something to say about social mechanisms. Such mechanisms\nare also an object of study in voting theory, in auction theory, in\nsocial choice theory, in social epistemology, in mechanism design\ntheory, and in algorithmic game theory. Multi-agent interaction at a\nmore abstract level is studied in artificial intelligence and\ndistributed computing, so all these disciplines have something to say\nabout the formal analysis of social interaction.\n",
