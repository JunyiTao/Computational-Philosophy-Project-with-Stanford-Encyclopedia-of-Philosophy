    "main_text": "Iamblichus\u2019 System || Overarching concepts and general traits\n3.5 Overarching concepts and general traits\n\nIamblichus\u2019 work exerted a very profound influence on the\nsubsequent course of Neoplatonic philosophy. In particular, he stands\nout as an important theologian owing to the shift he brought about\nwith respect to Plotinianism. With Iamblichus, Plotinus\u2019\neconomical approach to metaphysical principles was developed into\nfull-fledged metaphysical laws: in this respect, Iamblichus emerges as\na remote forerunner of Medieval scholasticism. He himself vindicated a\n\u201cscientific theology\u201d (Reply to Porphyry I, 4\n[SS-2013: 10.18]) and established a canon of texts that gave it the\njustification of tradition.\n\nPerhaps the most conspicuous trait of Iamblichean metaphysics is its\nhighly vertical conception of causality. For Iamblichus, an effect\ndoes not enjoy any ontological independence with respect to its cause:\nanything it adds amounts to failure and nothingness. This idea\npredates Iamblichus, but he was the first Pagan philosopher to apply\nit with absolute consistency. Most of his system follows from this one\naxiom, particularly his doctrine of the soul (see\n Section 6).\n The principles\u2019 supervision always lurks in the background:\nsee, e.g., the idea that the intelligible gods \u201ccontain\u201d\nthe visible gods (i.e., planets; Reply to Porphyry I, 19\n[SS-2013: 45.14\u201320]). The idea of the vacuity of effects leads\nto the notion that their sole purpose is to render themselves apt to\nreceive the influx of their causes: Iamblichus calls this\nepit\u0113deiot\u0113s, or \u201creceptivity\u201d. This\nprocess of adaptation accounts for most of the diversity in the\nphenomenal world. Another important law states that \u201ceverything\nis in everything according to its property\u201d: Damascius ascribes\nit to both Iamblichus and Porphyry (In Philebum \u00a7 130 =\nIamblichus In Philebum [D-1973: Fr. 5]). The last words are\nthe most important: superior beings keep their prerogatives in spite\nof the existence of a universal homology, which means for example that\ncauses are present to their effects as causes, i.e., are not\nencompassed by them or relegated to their status. In this way,\nIamblichus manages to preserve at the same time the benefits of divine\nimmanence (the world is not abandoned by the gods) and the requirement\nof divine transcendence, which he feels the need to constantly affirm,\nlest he be accused of debasing divinity.\n\nIamblichus\u2019 programme of a scientific theology (see Lecerf\nand Taormina forthcoming) is based on newly developed\nterminology, of which we have already seen several examples. It also\nrelies on new structures such as divine orders (diakosmoi,\ntaxeis), a notion foreign to Plotinus. Their proliferation\ndoes not bother Iamblichus in the least, since centrifugal tendencies\nare curbed by constantly reasserting the fundamental unity of reality.\nThis is provided for through the return of the same processes in a\nmore or less absolute form (for instance, what exists in a unified\nmanner in the universal Paradigm as a whole appears again in\nindividual paradigms, yet only partially: see In Timaeum\n[D-1973: Fr. 43]). Recurring metaphysical laws serve the same purpose,\nas do schemes such as the regrouping of divine entities in accordance\nwith meaningful numbers, e.g., triads, a structure that adequately\naccounts for uni-multiplicity in reality since it treats as one single\nprocess the succession of an immobile first state\n(mon\u0113), a dynamic procession (proodos) and a\nreturn or \u201cconversion\u201d to the first element\n(epistroph\u0113; see In Timaeum [D-1973: Fr. 53]).\nTriads are thus a prime example of what modern commentators have named\nthe \u201claw of mean-terms\u201d, i.e., the need for a tertium\nquid to provide a mediation between two levels. Continuity is\nthereby introduced in the picture, although the latter remains\nresolutely holistic. The whole stands in relation to its parts as a\ncause to its effect: in this sense, it may be said that Iamblichus\ncreated and almost deified the Neoplatonic system as a unified and\ncoherent account of reality, avoiding any recourse to dualism.\n",
