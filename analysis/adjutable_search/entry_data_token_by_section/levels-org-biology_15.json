Beginning with the\nnotion\u2019s ubiquitous presence in textbooks and other introductory\nstatements in biology (see Schneewei\u00df & Gropengie\u00dfer\n2019 for a review; examples include, e.g., Begon, Townshend &\nHarper 2006; Lobo 2008; Mader 2010; Urry et al. 2016; O\u2019Neill et\nal. 1986), depictions of levels often dominate the first few pages of\nmajor biology textbooks with large centerfold illustrations stretching\nacross whole pages. In this capacity, the levels concept serves as an\norganizational principle that communicates basic themes of the study\nof biology to aspiring scientists early in their training (Brooks\n2023).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Diagram of levels of\norganization from General Biology (Boundless),\n \u00a71.8;\n CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\nSome of the usage patterns one finds in support of these basic themes\nwithin contemporary textbooks include, e.g., (i) the apparent\npreponderance of emergence in living systems, (ii) the need to be\naware of the relative success of reductive and non-reductive,\n\u201csystemic\u201d approaches to analyzing biological phenomena,\nand (iii) the need to actively embed choices of investigation within\nappropriate methods that are more-or-less useful at different scale\nresolutions. These uses, present already in early historical textbook\nreferences to levels, in turn has been offered as a partial\nexplanation for the rapid uptake of the concept in the textbook\nliterature in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nThe efforts of Eugene P. Odum (see especially Odum 1959; 1963; cf.\nOdum 1953) in particular imbued the levels concept with a fundamental\ncharacter attached to the study of the life sciences. In his two\nsuccessful series of textbooks Fundamentals of Ecology (five\neditions) and Ecology (two editions), the levels concept was\nfoundational to the structure of the books themselves, following the\ndifferent scale-bound units of ecology. This \u201clevels\napproach\u201d in turn was applied as a means of teaching students to\nsearch for \u201cdistributive adequacy\u201d in the investigative\npractices of scientists (Brooks 2023). That is, Odum presented one\ncore lesson of the levels concept to be that no one level was\nprivileged over others in delivering the \u201cright\u201d answer to\na given scientific question. Instead, investigating multiple levels\nwould be needed to adequately gather results that would satisfactorily\nanswer scientific questions.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Levels of organization diagram\nredrawn from Odum 1971, 5.\n\n\nTo be sure, while scientific textbooks often only allude to\ncutting-edge science, preferring to display established knowledge\naccessible to novices, this already enables viewing the levels concept\nas exhibiting usefulness for later stages of scientific training,\nparticularly when seen as a scientific doctrine (see Brooks 2021a:\n47\u201350, for a discussion). Specifically, and especially when\nviewed with the motivation to teach students \u201chow to think like\na biologist\u201d (Urry et al. 2016), the centrality of the levels\nconcept in textbooks can be seen as representative of the expressive\npower of the concept in reconstructing scientific reasoning.\n\nIn addition to active usage as an organizing principle in textbooks,\nthe levels concept has also attracted increasing attention from\nscientific educators for improving and innovating new learning and\nteaching strategies in biology. Noting the concept \u201cas central\nto the study and practice of science\u201d (1999: 3), Wilensky and\nResnik argue that focusing on the levels concept as a pedagogical\ndevice is \u201ccritically important to the understanding of many\nscientific phenomena and many foundational philosophical\nquestions\u201d (1999: 17; see also J\u00f6rdens et al. 2016). More\nrecently, Knippels and Waarlo (2018) have reviewed the implementation\nof the so-called \u201cyo-yo strategy\u201d in biology classrooms as\none explicit means of applying the levels concept to introduce and\n\u201cpromote coherent conceptual understanding of various biological\nphenomena\u201d (Knippels & Waarlo 2018: 1). The yo-yo strategy,\ncharacterized as a \u201cheuristic of systems thinking\u201d\n(ibid.), was explicitly developed to aid grasping complicated\nbiological phenomena (such as Mendelian genetics or biological issues\nassociated with understanding sickle cell anemia), for which more\nlinear forms of learning face difficulties in securing student\ncomprehension (see Knippels & Waarlo 2018 for a discussion). This\nstrategy works by first localizing the contributions of different\nleveled components to primary units of the system (e.g., organism,\ncell, molecule), and then shifting \u201cup and down\u201d between\nthese units to gather insight into the specific contributions that\neach unit expresses for more general biological lessons. A related\napproach to implementing levels into active learning strategies has\nbeen developed by Schneewei\u00df and Gropengie\u00dfer (2022; see\nalso Schneewei\u00df, M\u00f6lgen, & Gropengie\u00dfer 2022).\nTheir \u201czoom map\u201d encourages students to not only explore\ndifferent levels of organization in the construction of explanations,\nthey also place a marked emphasis on interacting with the units\nperched at various levels to encourage learning how different levels\ncontribute to answering different questions posed of the same\nphenomenon.\n",
