    "main_text": "Inductive-Statistical Explanation || Statistical Relevance vs. Causal Relevance\n6.2 Statistical Relevance vs. Causal Relevance\n\nSalmon offered a series of counterexamples to Hempel\u2019s approach.\nIn the case of I-S explanations, Hempel required that the nomic\nexpectability of the explanandum must be equal to or greater than .5,\nwhich preserved the symmetry thesis for explanations of this kind.\nThis implied that events with low probability could not be explained.\nThere were persuasive illustrations, moreover, demonstrating that\nexplanations could satisfy Hempel\u2019s criteria, yet not explain\nwhy their explanandum events occur. For example,\n\n(CE-1)\nJohn Jones was almost certain to recover from his cold within a\nweek, because he took vitamin C, and almost all colds clear up within\na week after administration of vitamin C. \n(CE-2)\nJohn Jones experienced significant remission of his neurotic\nsymptoms, for he underwent extensive psychoanalytic treatment and a\nsubstantial percentage of those who undergo psychoanalytic treatment\nexperience significant remission of neurotic symptoms. \n\n\nMost colds clear up within a week, with or without vitamin C, and\nsimilarly for neurotic symptoms. Salmon thought that this problem was\npeculiar to statistical explanations, but was corrected by Henry\nKyburg (1965), who offered examples of the following kind:\n\n(CE-3)\nThis sample of table salt dissolves in water, for it has had a\ndissolving spell cast upon it, and all samples of table salt that have\nhad dissolving spells cast upon them dissolve in water. \n(CE-4)\nJohn Jones avoided becoming pregnant during the past year, for he\nhas taken his wife\u2019s birth control pills regularly, and every\nman who regularly takes birth control pills avoids\npregnancy. \n\n\nFor Hempel, a property \\(F\\) is explanatorily\nrelevant to the occurrence of an outcome \\(G\\) if\nthere is a lawful relationship that relates \\(F\\) to\n\\(G\\). If table salt dissolves in water, so does\nMorton\u2019s table salt, Morton\u2019s finest table salt,\nMorton\u2019s finest table salt bought on sale, and so on. Salmon\nconcluded that Hempel\u2019s conception of I-S explanation was\nwrong.\n\nA student of Reichenbach (1938, 1949), Salmon had adopted and defended\nthe limiting frequency interpretation of physical probability, where\n\u201c\\(P(G/F) = r\\)\u201d means that \\(G\\) occurs\nwith a limiting frequency \\(r\\) in a reference class of\ninstances of \\(F\\), which has to be infinite for limits\nto exist (Salmon 1967, 1971). On this approach, a property \\(H\\)\nis explanatorily relevant to the occurrence\nof an attribute \\(G\\) within a reference class \\(F\\)\njust in case (SR):\n\n(SR)\n\\(P(G/F \\amp H) = m\\) and \\(P(G/F \\amp \\neg H) = n\\), where \\(m\n\\ne n\\);\n\n\nthat is, the limiting frequency for \\(G\\) in \\(F\\)-and-\\(H\\)\ndiffers from the limiting\nfrequency for \\(G\\) in \\(F\\)-and-not-\\(H\\).\nProperties whose presence does not make a difference\nto the limiting frequency for the occurrence of \\(G\\)\nin \\(F\\) would therefore qualify as statistically\nirrelevant. Relative frequencies were typically relied upon in\npractice, but in principle they had to be limiting.\n\nSalmon also rejected Hempel\u2019s requirement that the nomic\nexpectability of a statistical explanation must be equal to or greater\nthan .5, which led him to abandon the notion of explanations as\narguments. Even events of low probability were explainable within the\ncontext of Salmon\u2019s approach, which he compared with\nHempel\u2019s approach as follows:\n\n\nI-S model (Hempel): an explanation is an argument that\nrenders the explanandum highly probable;\n\nS-R model (Salmon): an explanation is an assembly of facts\nstatistically relevant to the explanandum regardless of the\ndegree of probability that results. (Salmon 1971, original\nemphasis)\n\n\nSalmon\u2019s work created a sensation, since Hempel\u2019s\ndominance of the philosophy of science, especially in relation to the\ntheory of explanation, now had a significant rival. The students of\nexplanation who recognized that probabilities as properties of\ninfinite classes posed substantial problems were few, and those who\nrealized that Salmon\u2019s position confronted difficulties of its\nown fewer still.\n\nSalmon was ingenious in devising \u201cscreening off\u201d criteria\nto insure that the properties cited in an S-R explanation were\nrestricted to those that were statistically relevant. He may have\nappreciated that the available evidence was restricted to relative\nfrequencies in finite sequences, but that could be discounted as\ntypical of the distinction between a context \\(\\mathbf{K}\\)\nrepresenting our total knowledge at that time and the truth condition,\nsince scientific knowledge is always tentative and fallible. A deeper\nproblem arose from the existence of properties that were statistically\nrelevant but not explanatorily relevant, however. If women whose\nmiddle initials began with vowels, for example, experienced\nmiscarriages with a different frequency than women whose middle\ninitials began with consonants\u2014even after other properties were\ntaken into account\u2014then that property would have to qualify as\nstatistically relevant and therefore explanatorily relevant\n(Fetzer 1974, 1981). This result implied that statistical relevance\ncannot adequately define explanatory relevance, and Salmon would\ngradually move toward the propensity approach in Salmon (1980,\n1989).\n",
