    "main_text": "\n\nThis article provides a survey of classic and recent work in\nconditional logic. We review the problems of a two-valued analysis and\nexamine logics based on richer semantic frameworks that have been\nproposed to deal with conditional sentences of the form \u201cif\nA, B,\u201d including trivalent semantics,\npossible-world semantics, premise semantics, and probabilistic\nsemantics. We go on to examine theories of conditionals involving\nbelief revision, and highlight recent approaches based on the idea\nthat a conditional is assertable provided the truth of its antecedent\nmakes a relevant difference to that of its consequent. We close with a\nbrief discussion of systems accounting for the interaction of\nconditionals with modalities and speech act operators.\n",
