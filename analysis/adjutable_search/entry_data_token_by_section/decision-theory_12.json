    "main_text": "Challenges to EU theory || On completeness: Vague beliefs and desires\n5.2 On completeness: Vague beliefs and desires\n\nAs noted in\n Section 4,\n criticisms of the EU requirement of a complete preference ordering\nare motivated by both epistemic and desire/value considerations. On\nthe value side, many contend that a rational agent may simply find two\noptions incomparable due to their incommensurable\nqualities. (Here a prominent usage of these terms will be followed,\nwhereby particular options may be described as incomparable in value,\nwhile general properties or dimensions of value may be described as\nincommensurable.) As in, the agent\u2019s evaluations of the\ndesirability of sure options may not be representable by any precise\nutility function. Likewise, on the belief side, some contend (notably,\nJoyce 2010 and Bradley 2017) that the evidence may be such that it\ndoes not commit a rational agent to precise degrees of belief\nmeasurable by a unique probability function.\n\nThere are various alternative, \u201cfuzzier\u201d representations\nof desire and belief that might be deemed more suitable. Halpern\n(2003), for instance, investigates different ways of conceptualising\nand representing epistemic uncertainty, once we depart from\nprobabilities. Presumably there are also various ways to represent\nuncertain desire. Here the focus will be on just one proposal that is\npopular amongst philosophers: the use of sets of probability\nand utility functions to represent uncertainty in belief and desire\nrespectively. This is a minimal generalisation of the standard EU\nmodel, in the sense that probability and utility measures still\nfeature. Roughly, the more severe the epistemic uncertainty, the more\nprobability measures over the space of possibilities needed to\nconjointly represent the agent\u2019s beliefs. This notion of\nrational belief is referred to as imprecise probabilism (see\nthe entry on\n imprecise probabilities).\n Likewise, the more severe the evaluative uncertainty, the more\nutility measures over the space of sure options needed to conjointly\nrepresent the agent\u2019s desires. Strictly speaking, we should not\ntreat belief and desire separately, but rather talk of the\nagent\u2019s incomplete preferences being represented by a set of\nprobability and utility pairs. Recall the requirement that incomplete\npreferences be coherently extendible (refer back to\n Section 1);\n on this representation, all the probability-utility pairs amount to\ncandidate extensions of the incomplete preferences.\n\nThe question then arises: Is there a conservative generalisation of\nthe EU decision rule that can handle sets of probability and utility\npairs? Contender decision rules are standardly framed in terms of\nchoice functions that take as input some set of feasible options and\nreturn as output a non-empty set of admissible choices that is a\nsubset of the feasible options. A basic constraint on these choice\nfunctions is that they respect the agent\u2019s preferences in cases\nwhere options are in fact comparable. That is, if all pairs of\nprobability and utility functions characterising the agent\u2019s\nattitudes agree on the ranking of two options, then these particular\noptions should be ranked accordingly. The relevant constraint on\nchoice functions is that \u201cEU-dominated options\u201d are not\nadmissible choices, i.e., if an option has lower expected utility than\nanother option according to all pairs of probability and utility\nfunctions, then the former dominated option is not an admissible\nchoice. Note that Levi (1986) has a slightly more restrictive\ncondition on admissibility: if an option does not have maximum EU for\nat least one pair of probability and utility functions, then it is not\nadmissible. In ordinary cases where sets of probability and utility\nfunctions are closed convex sets, however, Levi\u2019s condition is\nequivalent to the aforementioned one that rules out EU-dominated\noptions (Schervish et al. 2003).\n\nThe treatment of genuinely incomparable options (those surviving the\nabove admissibility test and yet are not such that the agent is\nindifferent) is where the real controversies begin. See Bradley (2017)\nfor extensive discussion of the various ways to proceed. A\nconsideration that is often appealed to in order to discriminate\nbetween incomparable options is caution. The Maxmin-EU rule, for\ninstance, recommends picking the action with greatest minimum expected\nutility (see Gilboa and Schmeidler 1989; Walley 1991). The rule is\nsimple to use, but arguably much too cautious, paying no attention at\nall to the full spread of expected utilities. The \\(\\alpha\\)-Maxmin\nrule, by contrast, recommends taking the action with the greatest\n\\(\\alpha\\)-weighted sum of the minimum and maximum expected utilities\nassociated with it. The relative weights for the minimum and maximum\nexpected utilities can be thought of as reflecting either the decision\nmaker\u2019s pessimism in the face of uncertainty or else her degree\nof caution (see Binmore 2009).\n\nThere are more complicated choice rules that depend on a richer\nrepresentation of uncertainty involving a notion of\nconfidence. For instance, Klibanoff et al. (2005) propose a\nrule whereby choices are made between otherwise incomparable options\non the basis of confidence-weighted expected utility. It presupposes\nthat weights can be assigned to the various expected utilities\nassociated with an act, reflecting the agent\u2019s confidence in the\ncorresponding probability and utility pairs. There are alternative\nrules that appeal to confidence even in the absence of precise\ncardinal weights. G\u00e4rdenfors and Sahlin (1982), for instance,\nsuggest simply excluding from consideration any probability (and\nutility) functions that fall below a confidence threshold, and then\napplying the Maxmin-EU rule based on the remainder. Hill\u2019s\n(2013) choice theory is somewhat similar, although confidence\nthresholds for probability and utility pairs are allowed to vary\ndepending on the choice problem (and the term \u201cconfidence\u201d\nis itself used differently). There are further proposals whereby acts\nare compared in terms of how much uncertainty they can tolerate (which\nagain depends on levels of confidence) and yet still be a satisfactory\noption (see, e.g., Ben-Haim 2001). These rules are compelling, but\nthey do raise a host of difficult questions regarding how to interpret\nand measure the extra subjective attitudes that play a role, like\n\u201camount of confidence in a belief/desire\u201d and\n\u201csatisfactory level of desirability\u201d.\n",
