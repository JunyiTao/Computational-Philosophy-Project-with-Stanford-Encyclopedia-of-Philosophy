    "main_text": "The \u201cMan Measure\u201d Thesis || \u201cOf all things the measure is man\u201d: the epistemological interpretation\n2.1 \u201cOf all things the measure is man\u201d: the epistemological interpretation\n\nTruth is one of Protagoras\u2019 most famous books. Ancient\nbooks were not necessarily given their titles by their authors; but\nPlato and Aristotle continuously refer to Protagoras\u2019 text as\nAletheia and also make puns, confirming that Protagoras\nhimself gave this title. The notion of \u201ctruth\u201d played a\nprominent role among the Presocratics: in choosing this title,\nProtagoras clearly wanted to present himself as an heir to this\nlong-established tradition; and by questioning the existence of one\nsingle truth, as we will see, he sought to challenge it. The first\nsentence of the treatise fully confirms its author\u2019s provocative\nintentions: \u201cOf all things the measure is man: of those that\nare, that they are; and of those that are not, that they are\nnot\u201d (80B1 DK; for the sake of convenience, this sentence will\nbe abbreviated as MM). MM is one of the few authentic Protagoras\nfragments to have been preserved and many ancient sources confirm that\nthe statement was originally formulated precisely in these terms. The\nproblem, however, is its opacity: ancient readers debated what\nProtagoras really meant, and modern interpretations have only\nincreased doubt. As a matter of fact, it cannot be ruled out that a\ncertain degree of ambiguity was intentional. Truth was not a\nscientific treatise but an epideixis, the text of public\nperformance, which was meant \u201cto demonstrate one\u2019s\nvirtuoso skill in argumentation\u201d (Lee 2005: 27, after Lloyd\n1987: 96). In opening his speech, Protagoras sought to capture the\nattention of his audience (or reader) by making a striking and\nallusive claim. There is nothing odd in all of this, since a desire to\ncapture the audience\u2019s attention was quite typical of the\nsophists, and is confirmed by many other sources (the sentence\nintroducing the treatise on the gods was just as provocative, see\n \u00a74).\n\nThis is not to say that MM had no specific meaning. Simply, it is a\nmatter of dealing with potentially ambiguous elements. In particular,\nit is necessary to clarify the notion of man, i.e., whether\n\u201cman\u201d refers to each individual or to humanity in general:\nin discussing this issue, the meaning of the other terms that make up\nthe sentence will also become clearer. In turn, this will help us\nassess the underlying meaning of Protagoras\u2019 thesis and its\nfield of applicability, so as to determine whether it is only an\nepistemological thesis or whether it also carries practical or\npolitical implications. As it will turn out, the sentence can be read\non different levels, in accordance with the archaic logic which says\nthere is no need to clearly distinguish the different meanings\npossessed by a term.\n\nThere are three main sources for MM: Plato, our most important source,\nAristotle, and Sextus Empiricus. All three understand the\nphrase\u2014at any rate at a first level\u2014as though\n\u201cman\u201d referred to \u201ceach individual\u201d. In the\nTheaetetus MM is equated with the claim that \u201cknowledge\nis sensation\u201d and paraphrased as follows: \u201cjust as each\nthing appears to me, so too it is for me, and just as it appears to\nyou, so too again for you\u201d (Theaetetus 152a). Thus, if\nthe wind appears warm to me, it is warm for me; and if it appears cold\nto another person, it is cold for her. In other words, MM means that\neach person is the measure of her own sensations, and Protagoras\nemerges as a supporter of an empiricist theory that bases knowledge on\nsensory data.\n\nPlato\u2019s testimony is crucial and his reconstruction is also\ntaken up by other authors (see 80A16 DK and 80B1 DK). It is, however,\na reductive interpretation that potentially misleads. The underlying\naim of Theaetetus is not to accurately report the theses of\nPlato\u2019s opponent, but to show their philosophical limits:\naccording to Plato, the MM thesis is a muddled one; the only way to\nmake it clear is by assuming that Protagoras was only speaking of\nsensations; and since (according to Plato) it is impossible to base\nknowledge on sensations alone, it follows that the thesis is\nfallacious. This strict empiricist reading is philosophically\ninteresting but not historically reliable, because Protagoras was not\nspeaking of sensations alone. Remarkably, Plato himself suggests that\nProtagoras\u2019 phrase had a broader meaning by remarking that MM\nalso concerned all opinions and judgements (157d, 170a\u2013171a).\nAristotle and Sextus Empiricus further confirm the need for a broader\ninterpretation: what are at play are not just sensations but more\ngenerally all opinions and judgements (and especially value\njudgements). On this interpretation, MM means that each individual is\nthe ultimate arbiter of all her own judgements\u2014not only that the\nwind is warm or cold, but also that performing a given action is right\nor\n wrong.[1]\n\nThe point just made is crucial for a correct reconstruction of the\noverall meaning of Protagoras\u2019 position. The transition to a\nbroader conception of human activities (not only sense-perceptions but\nhuman judgements as a whole) brings out one aspect of the thesis that\nscholars have all too often overlooked. From the example of wind it\nseems that Protagoras was addressing the problem of human knowledge in\nabstract terms, by examining the general ways in which the process of\nknowledge-acquisition unfolds\u2014in other words, by investigating\nwhat happens to a subject X who at a given moment t\nexperiences sensation f (let us think of the example of the\nwind). This is not correct. It is certainly true that\nProtagoras\u2019 thesis was concerned with human knowledge. However,\nit is not true that it focused on it in an \u201cabstract\u201d way,\nas though men could be stimulated from the outside so as to study\ntheir reactions at given moments and in specific circumstances. This\napproach might work in the case of the wind, but not in that of\njudgements concerning what is good or bad. \u201cMan\u201d refers to\nthe individual, yet not to a generic, impersonal, subject: Protagoras\nhas concrete, historically well-defined people in mind, with their\nideas and prejudices. What is meant by \u201cman\u201d, therefore,\nis each person with his or her own personal history, experiences, and\nexpectations with a past and a future, i.e., people whose judgements\nlargely reflect their individual experience. When I claim that a\ncertain thing or action is good (or beautiful or unjust), I do so on\nthe basis of a series of ideas and opinions that I have acquired over\nthe course of my life and that I have continued to put to test through\nmy engagement with facts\u2014in other words, on the basis of my\nexperience, which is different from that of other people. The true\nmeasure, then, is not man in the abstract sense but rather each\nindividual\u2019s experience (Mansfeld 1981: 44\u201346). Clearly\nthis claim also carries a polemical undertone with respect to the\nso-called \u201cmasters of truth\u201d, that is, philosophers like\nParmenides (see also 80B2 DK), for whom terms such as\n\u201cman\u201d and \u201copinion\u201d were synonymous with\nerror, and the poets who claimed to be divinely inspired. There is no\nprivileged access to any divine or higher reality. The ultimate\npurpose of Protagoras\u2019 statement is to re-evaluate human\nexperiences.\n\nHaving clarified the meaning of \u201cman\u201d, we can now turn to\nconsider the second part of the phrase, \u201cof those that are, that\nthey are; and of those that are not, that they are not\u201d.\nEssentially, it is a matter of clarifying what \u201cthings\u201d\nmeans and in what sense man \u201cmeasures\u201d them. Based on what\nhas been noted so far, we can reasonably claim that what Protagoras\nmeant by \u201cthings\u201d was not just material objects and\nentities with their specific properties (things that can be perceived\nby the senses, such as wind): \u201cthings\u201d are to be\nunderstood in their broadest possible sense as facts or\nevents\u2014e.g., the temperature of the wind, but also an event such\nas performing a certain action and all that happens to man. In this\nrespect, the choice of the term is probably revealing. Chrema\nderives from the verb chraomai, meaning \u201cto\ntreat\u201d, \u201cto use\u201d, \u201cto entertain a relation\nwith\u201d: according to its original meaning, the term describes not\nso much \u201cthings\u201d in themselves (in this case Protagoras\ncould have used onta or pragmata), as in relation to\nus; the emphasis is on the way in which we relate to things, use them,\njudge them, and so on. As far as the notion of measure is concerned,\nit is clear that man is the measure not of the existence of these\nthings and facts, but rather of the way in which they present\nthemselves (e.g., warm/cold or good/bad). The verb \u201cis\u201d\nmust be understood not in an existential sense (in which case it would\nbe difficult to understand what it means for man to be the measure of\nthe non-existence of the things that are not), but rather in a\nmodal-predicative sense: Protagoras is not denying the existence of\nthe external world, but only limiting the possibility of knowing it to\nthe way in which it presents itself to our experience: hence, if I\njudge the wind to be warm, I am the measure of the fact that it is\nwarm and not of the fact that it exists; and if I judge the wind not\nto be warm, I am measure of the fact that it is not warm and not of\nthe fact that it does not exist (but this does not exclude some\nspecific cases where I can also be the measure of existence or lack\nthere of, for instance the Gods: interestingly, the opening sentence\nof fr. 4 on the Gods appears to have existential implications, see\nbelow\n \u00a74).\n Things in themselves do not possess any predetermined truth or any\nintrinsic value: they simply exist, they are what surrounds man, what\nhappens to him. But what matters is the way in which we relate to\nthem: each individual, according to his or her experience, is the\njudge of these facts, insofar as he or she assigns them a degree of\nconsistency or value.\n",
