    "main_text": "The History of Ideas\n3. The History of Ideas\n\nBerlin\u2019s emphasis on the subversive, liberating, anti-orthodox\nnature of philosophy was accompanied by a particular interest in\nmoments of radical change in the history of ideas, and in original,\nheterodox and often marginal thinkers, while his emphasis on the\npractical consequences of ideas led him to focus on those\ntransformations and challenges which, in his view, had wrought\nparticularly decisive changes in people\u2019s moral and political\nconsciousness, and in their behaviour. Finally, his concern with the\nconflicts of his own day led him to concentrate mainly on modern\nintellectual history, and to trace the emergence of certain ideas that\nhe regarded as particularly important, for good or ill, in the\ncontemporary\n world.[9]\n\nMany of Berlin\u2019s writings on the history of ideas were connected\nto his philosophical work, and to one another, in their examination of\ncertain overarching themes. These included the relationship between\nthe sciences and the humanities; the philosophy of history; the\norigins of nationalism and socialism; the revolt against what Berlin\ncalled \u2018monism\u2019 in general, and scientism in particular,\nin the early nineteenth century and thereafter; and the vicissitudes\nof ideas of liberty.\n\nThe narrative of the history of ideas that Berlin developed and\nrefined over the course of his works began with the Enlightenment, and\nfocused on the initial rebellion against what he regarded as that\nepoch\u2019s dominant\n assumptions.[10]\n\nIn Berlin\u2019s account, the thinkers of the Enlightenment believed\nhuman beings to be naturally either benevolent or malleable. This\ncreated a tension within Enlightenment thought between the view that\nnature dictates human ends, and the view that nature provides more or\nless neutral material, to be moulded rationally and benevolently\n(ultimately the same thing) by conscious human interventions \u2013\neducation, legislation, rewards and punishment, the whole apparatus of\n society.[11]\n Berlin also attributed to the Enlightenment the beliefs that all\nhuman problems, both of knowledge and ethics, can be resolved through\nthe discovery and application of the proper method (generally reason,\nthe conception of which was based on the methods of the sciences,\nparticularly Newtonian physics); and that genuine human goods and\ninterests were ultimately compatible, so that conflict, like\nwickedness, was the result of ignorance, misunderstanding, or\ndeception and oppression practiced by corrupt authorities\n(particularly the\n Church).[12]\n\nBerlin saw the school (or schools) of thought that began to emerge\nshortly before the French Revolution, and became ascendant during and\nafter it, as profoundly antagonistic towards the Enlightenment. He was\nmost interested in German Romanticism, but also looked at other\nmembers of the larger tendency he referred to as the\n \u2018Counter-Enlightenment\u2019.[13]\n Berlin\u2019s account sometimes focused on a attack on the\nEnlightenment\u2019s benevolent and optimistic liberalism by\nnationalists and reactionaries; sometimes on the rejection of moral\nand cultural universalism by champions of cultural particularism and\npluralism; and sometimes on the critique of naturalism and scientism\nby thinkers who advocated a historicist view of society as essentially\ndynamic, shaped not by the laws of nature, but by the unlawlike,\npurposeless contingencies of history.\n\nBerlin has been viewed both as an adherent of the Enlightenment who\nshowed a fascination, whether eccentric or admirable, with its\ncritics; and as a critic and even opponent of the Enlightenment, who\nfrankly admired its enemies. There is some truth in both of these\npictures, neither of which does justice to the complexity of\nBerlin\u2019s views. Berlin admired many of the thinkers of the\nEnlightenment, and explicitly regarded himself as \u2018on their\nside\u2019 (Jahanbegloo 1992, 70); he believed that much of what they\nhad accomplished had been for the good; and, as an empiricist, he\nrecognised them as part of the same philosophical tradition to which\nhe belonged. But he also believed that they were wrong, and sometimes\ndangerously so, about some of the most important questions of society,\nmorality and politics. He regarded their psychological and historical\nvision as shallow, excessively uniform, and naive; and he traced to\nthe Enlightenment a technocratic, managerial view of human beings and\npolitical problems to which he was profoundly opposed, and which, in\nthe late 1940s and early 1950s, he regarded as one of the gravest\ndangers facing the world.\n\nBerlin regarded the Enlightenment\u2019s critics as in many ways\ndangerous and deluded. He attacked or dismissed their metaphysical\nbeliefs, particularly the philosophies of history of Hegel and his\nsuccessors. He was also wary of the aesthetic approach to politics\nthat many Romantics had practised and fostered. And, while\nappreciative of some elements in the Romantic conception of liberty,\nhe saw Romanticism\u2019s influence on the development of the idea of\nliberty as largely perverting. But at the same time he thought the\nEnlightenment\u2019s opponents had pointed to many important truths\nthat the Enlightenment had neglected or denied, both negative (the\npower of unreason, and particularly the darker passions, in human\naffairs) and positive (the inherent value of variety and of personal\nvirtues such as integrity and sincerity, and the centrality to human\nnature and dignity of the capacity for choice). Romanticism rebelled\nin particular against the constricting order imposed by reason, and\nchampioned the human will. Berlin was sympathetic to this stance, but\nalso believed that the Romantics had gone too far both in their\nprotests and in their celebrations. He remained committed to the goal\nof understanding the world so as to be able to \u2018act rationally\nin it and on it\u2019 (1990, 2). His interest in critics of the\nEnlightenment reflected both curiosity about the views of those with\nwhom he often disagreed, and a desire to learn from the most acute\nchallenges to a progressive, \u2018liberal\n rationalist\u2019[14]\n (Jahanbegloo 1992, 70) or \u2018rational-liberal\u2019 (Berlin\n2006a, 104) position, so as to appreciate, and repair, its\nshortcomings and vulnerabilities. Berlin\u2019s own articulation of\nliberalism and pluralism attempted to integrate a defence of the\nEnlightenment\u2019s legacy with the insights of its critics.\n",
