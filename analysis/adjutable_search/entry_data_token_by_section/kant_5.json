    "main_text": "Transcendental idealism || The two-objects interpretation\n3.1 The two-objects interpretation\n\nThe two-objects reading is the traditional interpretation of\nKant\u2019s transcendental idealism. It goes back to the earliest\nreview of the Critique \u2013 the so-called G\u00f6ttingen\nreview by Christian Garve (1742\u20131798) and J. G. Feder\n (1740\u20131821)[9]\n \u2013 and it was the dominant way of interpreting Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism during his own lifetime. It has been a live\ninterpretive option since then and remains so today, although it no\nlonger enjoys the dominance that it once\n did.[10]\n\nAccording to the two-objects interpretation, transcendental idealism\nis essentially a metaphysical thesis that distinguishes between two\nclasses of objects: appearances and things in themselves. Another name\nfor this view is the two-worlds interpretation, since it can also be\nexpressed by saying that transcendental idealism essentially\ndistinguishes between a world of appearances and another world of\nthings in themselves.\n\nThings in themselves, on this interpretation, are absolutely real in\nthe sense that they would exist and have whatever properties they have\neven if no human beings were around to perceive them. Appearances, on\nthe other hand, are not absolutely real in that sense, because their\nexistence and properties depend on human perceivers. Moreover,\nwhenever appearances do exist, in some sense they exist in the mind of\nhuman perceivers. So appearances are mental entities or mental\nrepresentations. This, coupled with the claim that we experience only\nappearances, makes transcendental idealism a form of phenomenalism on\nthis interpretation, because it reduces the objects of experience to\nmental representations. All of our experiences \u2013 all of our\nperceptions of objects and events in space, even those objects and\nevents themselves, and all non-spatial but still temporal thoughts and\nfeelings \u2013 fall into the class of appearances that exist in the\nmind of human perceivers. These appearances cut us off entirely from\nthe reality of things in themselves, which are non-spatial and\nnon-temporal. Yet Kant\u2019s theory, on this interpretation,\nnevertheless requires that things in themselves exist, because they\nmust transmit to us the sensory data from which we construct\nappearances. In principle we cannot know how things in themselves\naffect our senses, because our experience and knowledge is limited to\nthe world of appearances constructed by and in the mind. Things in\nthemselves are therefore a sort of theoretical posit, whose existence\nand role are required by the theory but are not directly\nverifiable.\n\nThe main problems with the two-objects interpretation are\nphilosophical. Most readers of Kant who have interpreted his\ntranscendental idealism in this way have been \u2013 often very\n\u2013 critical of it, for reasons such as the following:\n\nFirst, at best Kant is walking a fine line in claiming on the one hand\nthat we can have no knowledge about things in themselves, but on the\nother hand that we know that things in themselves exist, that they\naffect our senses, and that they are non-spatial and non-temporal. At\nworst his theory depends on contradictory claims about what we can and\ncannot know about things in themselves. This objection was\ninfluentially articulated by Jacobi, when he complained that\n\u201cwithout that presupposition [of things in themselves] I could\nnot enter into the system, but with it I could not stay within\nit\u201d (Jacobi 1787, 336).\n\nSecond, even if that problem is surmounted, it has seemed to many that\nKant\u2019s theory, interpreted in this way, implies a radical form\nof skepticism that traps each of us within the contents of our own\nmind and cuts us off from reality. Some versions of this objection\nproceed from premises that Kant rejects. One version maintains that\nthings in themselves are real while appearances are not, and hence\nthat on Kant\u2019s view we cannot have experience or knowledge of\nreality. But Kant denies that appearances are unreal: they are just as\nreal as things in themselves but are in a different metaphysical\nclass. Another version claims that truth always involves a\ncorrespondence between mental representations and things in\nthemselves, from which it would follow that on Kant\u2019s view it is\nimpossible for us to have true beliefs about the world. But just as\nKant denies that things in themselves are the only (or privileged)\nreality, he also denies that correspondence with things in themselves\nis the only kind of truth. Empirical judgments are true just in case\nthey correspond with their empirical objects in accordance with the a\npriori principles that structure all possible human experience. But\nthe fact that Kant can appeal in this way to an objective criterion of\nempirical truth that is internal to our experience has not been enough\nto convince some critics that Kant is innocent of an unacceptable form\nof skepticism, mainly because of his insistence on our irreparable\nignorance about things in themselves.\n\nThird and finally, Kant\u2019s denial that things in themselves are\nspatial or temporal has struck many of his readers as incoherent. The\nrole of things in themselves, on the two-object interpretation, is to\naffect our senses and thereby to provide the sensory data from which\nour cognitive faculties construct appearances within the framework of\nour a priori intuitions of space and time and a priori concepts such\nas causality. But if there is no space, time, change, or causation in\nthe realm of things in themselves, then how can things in themselves\naffect us? Transcendental affection seems to involve a causal relation\nbetween things in themselves and our sensibility. If this is simply\nthe way we unavoidably think about transcendental affection, because\nwe can give positive content to this thought only by employing the\nconcept of a cause, while it is nevertheless strictly false that\nthings in themselves affect us causally, then it seems not only that\nwe are ignorant of how things in themselves really affect us. It\nseems, rather, to be incoherent that things in themselves could affect\nus at all if they are not in space or time.\n",
