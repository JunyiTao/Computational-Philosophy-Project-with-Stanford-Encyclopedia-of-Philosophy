    "main_text": "Association Theories || Gerard\n3.1 Gerard\n\nAlexander Gerard\u2019s theory of taste, advanced in his 1759\nEssay on Taste, is an attempt to mediate, or perhaps to\ntranscend, the dispute between internal-sense and imagination\ntheorists.\n\nGerard accepts as sound Hutcheson\u2019s argument for the internal\nsensibility of taste: that the perceptions of taste are simple, that\nthey arise immediately, and that they arise necessarily, show taste to\nbe a sense; that they are separate from and consequent upon those of\nexternal sense and reflection show taste to be internal (Gerard 1759,\n160\u2013161). But Gerard rejects what Hutcheson regards as a\ncorollary\u2014that taste is an ultimate or irreducible power.\nHutcheson may have taken the irreducibility of taste to follow from\nthe simplicity of its perceptions. Or he may have taken the\nirreducibility of taste to follow, by analogy, from the irreducibility\nof the external senses. But whether taste is irreducible depends\nmerely on whether its perceptions can be traced to some more basic\nmental power. Gerard believes that they can be: in fact he believes\nthat they can all be traced to \u201ccertain exertions\u201d of the\nmore basic power of the imagination (Gerard 1759, 167). Thus while\ntaste is \u201citself a species of sensation \u2026 in respect of\nits principles, [it is] justly reduced to imagination\u201d (Gerard\n1759, 160).\n\nBut what Gerard means by \u201cimagination\u201d is not what either\nAddison or Burke means, though it is not wholly unrelated either.\nOfficially at least, Gerard follows Addison and Burke in regarding\nimagination as a representational power and in opposing imagination to\nsense. But Gerard breaks from Addison and Burke crucially in also\nopposing imagination to memory. This allows him to group sense and\nmemory together as representational powers that purport to present\nideas in correspondence with reality and to isolate imagination as the\nrepresentational power that does not. That imagination is thus\nuntethered from reality does not, however, imply its utter\nlawlessness. It is governed by roughly Humean laws of association,\naccording to which it\n\nassociat[es] chiefly ideas which resemble, or are\ncontrary, or those that are conjoined, either merely by\ncustom, or by the connection of their objects in\nvicinity, coexistence, or causation. (p.\n168)\n\n\nHence another way of putting the contrast between sense and memory, on\nthe one hand, and imagination, on the other, is to say that the former\npresent ideas according to \u201creal bonds of union\u201d whereas\nthe latter presents ideas according to laws of association (Gerard\n1759, 167). In this way association becomes an essential element of\nimagination. Indeed on Gerard\u2019s view there seems, unofficially\nat least, to be no real difference between association and\nimagination\u2014at most imagination is the locus of association.\n\nSo when Gerard claims that the perceptions of taste can be traced to\n\u201ccertain exertions of imagination,\u201d the exertions\nhe has in mind are acts of association. The idea, roughly, is this.\nThe reducibility of taste implies that the perceptions of taste, which\nare pleasures, are not natural to their objects in the way Hutcheson,\nfor example, supposed. Objects of taste must, in other words, acquire\ntheir pleasurability, and association is the mechanism by which they\ndo so. Just how they do so varies, and the variations are too numerous\nfor cataloguing here. There is, however, a basic mechanism to which\nGerard recurs often in his explanations. It seems that the mind forges\nvery strong associations between its own processes and their objects,\nsuch that any pleasure natural to a mental process will transfer to\nits object. It also seems that any process that requires the mind\n\u201cto exert its activity, and put forth its strength, in order to\nsurmount any difficulty,\u201d is naturally pleasurable, as is the\nmind\u2019s consciousness of its success in surmounting any\ndifficulty (Gerard 1759, 3). Hence any object whose processing is\ndifficult enough to require the relevant exertion, but not so\ndifficult as to prevent its success, will give pleasure (Gerard 1759,\n3\u20134). Novel objects give pleasure because their unfamiliarity\nrenders their conception just difficult enough (Gerard 1759,\n5\u20136). Sublime objects give pleasure because their sheer scale\nrenders their conception just difficult enough (Gerard 1759, 14).\nImitations give pleasure because marking resemblances between them and\ntheir originals is just difficult enough (Gerard 1759, 49\u201351).\nAnd ridiculous (that is, humorous) objects give pleasure because\nmarking dissonance or inconsistency amongst their elements is just\ndifficult enough (Gerard 1759, 66\u201369).\n\nIn these and similar ways Gerard reduces internal sense to\nimagination. An important consequence of the reduction is that it\nallows Gerard to be neutral on the question of the primacy of the\nintellectual or the material with respect to objects of taste, over\nwhich internal-sense theorists and imagination theorists had divided.\nGerard, unique among the major British theorists of his century, shows\nno inclination to make one sort of object prior to the other. Indeed,\nwithin the essay\u2019s first pages he offers a rural prospect, a\nscientific discovery, a philosophical theory, a poem, and a painting,\nall as equally uncontroversial examples of objects of taste (Gerard\n1759, 6).\n",
