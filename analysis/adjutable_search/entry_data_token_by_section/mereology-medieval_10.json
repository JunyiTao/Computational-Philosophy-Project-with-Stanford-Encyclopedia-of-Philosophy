But there\nare some questions, many raised by minority parties among those who\nstudied Boethius, about whether a clear, principled distinction\nbetween these two kinds of whole can be maintained.\n\nTo see how these questions can be raised, consider one particular\nintegral whole that Boethius himself seems to countenance, namely, the\nintegral whole consisting of all the human beings on the planet\n(On Division 888c). Granted, this is a very large and diffuse\ndiscrete whole. But if we allow crowds and flocks to be integral\nwholes, there seems to be no principled reason to reject the existence\nof the sum of all humans. (And, again, medieval logicians would have\nhad the authority of Boethius as support.) At the same time each of\nthese human beings is a subjective part of the universal Human Being.\nIf wholes are distinguished by the type of parts that they have, it\nseems that the universal Human Being just is the integral whole\ncomposed of all human beings.\n\nPeter Abelard reports that there were some medieval philosophers who\ndrew this very conclusion. Abelard describes and attacks this\n\u201ccollection theory\u201d of universals in his Logica\nIngredientibus (1, 13.18\u201315.22). For fuller presentations\nand evaluations of Abelard\u2019s critique, one should consult Henry\n(1984, 235\u201359), Freddosso (1978), and Tweedale (1976,\n113\u201315). Here I will give only one objection: Abelard thinks\nthat the collection theory gets the relation of dependence between the\nuniversal and the individuals backwards. According to Abelard, the\ncollection theory is committed to the view that when Socrates dies,\nthe universal Human Being is changed, and if one believes, as Abelard\ndoes, that a discrete integral whole is identical to the sum of its\nparts, then the Human Being that has Socrates as a part is not\nidentical to the Human Being without Socrates. There is a new Human\nBeing. But this, Abelard insists, is contrary to the orthodox\nunderstanding of universals, which states that while the individuals\nthat fall under a universal are impermanent, the universal itself is\npermanent. Indeed, Human Being would exist even if every human being\nwere annihilated.\n\nYet, whatever one ultimately makes of the collection theory and\nAbelard\u2019s counterarguments, this much is clear: the difference\nbetween integral wholes and universal wholes cannot be defined solely\nand simply in terms of the kinds of items that are parts of these\nwholes. Substances can be parts of both. Rather, the distinction\nbetween universal wholes and integral wholes must be maintained in\nterms of more nuanced constraints or properties.\n\nMany medieval philosophers focus on the fact that every part of a\nuniversal whole taken singularly must accept the predication of the\nname and the definition of the whole, whereas this is not true of each\nand every part of an integral whole (Aquinas Summa Theol. III\nq. 90, art. 3; Walter Burley De toto et parte, 302; and\nBuridan Summulae 8.1.4). For example, Socrates and Plato are\nboth parts of the universal whole Human Being, and Human Being is\npredicable of both Socrates and Plato. That is,\n\nSocrates is a human being, and Socrates is a rational, mortal animal.\n\n\nand\n\nPlato is a human being, and Plato is a rational, mortal animal.\n\n\nThis is true of every part of Human Being. In contrast, an\nintegral whole is not predicable of its parts taken singularly. That\nis, one cannot say that\n\nThis piece of wood is a house.\n\n\nIntegral wholes are only predicable of their parts taken all at\nonce.\n\nThis wood and this stone and these other parts taken together are a\nhouse.\n\n\nThis seems to give us a principled way to exclude some items from the\nuniversal whole Human Being and thus to distinguish it from the\nintegral whole consisting of all human beings. For this seems to be\nright: only whole human beings are parts of Human Being. That is,\nSocrates and Cicero are parts of Human Being, but Socrates\u2019\nfinger and Cicero\u2019s head are not parts of Human Being, even\nthough the latter are parts of the integral whole consisting of all\nhuman beings. Socrates and Cicero are parts of Human Being because\nSocrates is a human being and Cicero is a human being. The parts of\nSocrates and Cicero are not parts of Human Being because\nSocrates\u2019 hand is not a human being and Cicero\u2019s head is\nnot a human being; whereas they are part of the integral whole\nconsisting of all the humans, since Transitivity seems to hold for\nintegral parts: if x is a part of y and y\nis a part of z, then x is also a part of z.\n(It should be noted, however, that some medieval authors were\nsuspicious of an unrestricted form Transitivity, even for integral\nwholes. See Arlig 2013 for details.) There is also this: while it is\ntrue that some of the parts of the sum of all human beings will accept\nthe predication of the name and definition of Human Being, if one\nexamines the matter carefully, it turns out that the definition of\nthe sum of all human beings is not the same as the species\nHuman Being, for the sum of all human beings is not itself a rational,\nmortal animal.\n\nThere is a complication that is raised by considering wholes that are\ncomposed of homogeneous parts. Boethius himself illustrates the\nproblem with the example of a bronze rod, which he believes is a\nhomogeneous substance (On Division 879d). Recall that if\nsomething is a homogeneous substance, then every part of that thing is\nalso the same substance. That is, if y is a homogeneous whole\nand x is a part of y, the name and definition of\ny is also predicable of x. Every portion of bronze\ncan take both the name and the definition of bronze, and hence, it\nseems that every part of the bronze rod meets the standard of being a\nsubjective part. Therefore, it seems that the bronze rod is a\nuniversal, which is clearly absurd.\n\nBoethius resolves the puzzle of the rod and its parts by noting that\nwhile it is true that each portion of bronze is bronze, it is not true\nthat a portion of the original quantity of bronze is that original\nquantity of bronze (Boethius On Division 880a)\nBoethius\u2019 solution is often repeated ((ps?) Abelard De\ndivisionibus 169.33\u201336; Albertus Magnus In de Div.\ntract. 2, ch. 5 (Loe ed., 35); and Radulphus Brito In de Top.\nII, q. 9 [1978, 45]; cf. Aquinas Summa Theologiae I, q. 3,\nart. 7).\n\nThe solution points to another difference between integral wholes and\nuniversals. As Abelard puts it, every integral whole \u201cdraws\ntogether\u201d (comprehendere) some quantity\n(Dialectica, 546.21\u201327). The suggestion is that when\nsome items compose an integral whole, that whole will be measurable\nwith respect to some quantity or other. The integral whole that is\nmeasured by some quantity need not be composed out of material\nelements. Consider the mereological sum of the angel Gabriel and the\nangel Michael. If this sum is a whole (and there seems to be no reason\nto deny this), it seems it is an integral whole. However, there are\nsome integral wholes which do not seem to embrace any quantity,\nnamely, thoughts and actions. So there is need to locate yet another\ndifference between universal wholes and integral wholes.\n\nThe last difference that we will consider is this: Universals, like\nHuman Being or Horse, are not literally composed out of their\nspecies. Integral wholes, such as Socrates or a house, are composed\nout of their parts (John Buridan Summulae de Dialectica\n6.4.4; Ockham Expositio in librum Porphyrii 2.16\n[Opera II, 54]). Composites are dependent upon their\ncomponents. Socrates is composed of his body and his soul. If these\ncomponents did not exist and combine to form Socrates, Socrates would\nnot exist. Components are often, but not necessarily, temporally prior\nto the whole that they compose. For example, the house is composed by\nbits of wood, stone, and iron, and these parts existed prior to the\nexistence of the house. Universal wholes are neither dependent upon\ntheir parts, nor are the parts of a universal temporally prior to it.\nThe species existed long before Socrates or Cicero, and will exist\nlong after Socrates and Cicero. Indeed, Human Being can exist, even if\nno individual human being exists.\n\nUnlike the appeal to quantity, the composition criterion can be\napplied to thoughts and actions, for a complex thought requires the\nsimpler concepts that compose it, and penance requires that the\nactions that constitute penance occur.\n\nOn the other hand, it appears that a universal is also a composite.\nEvery universal except for the most general of genera, can be said to\nbe \u201ccomposed\u201d out of a genus and a differentia.\nThese parts are sometimes called \u201cessential\u201d parts of the\nuniversal since the genus and differentia together constitute\nthe essence of the universal (Aquinas Summa Theologiae I, q.\n8, art. 2, ad 3; and I q. 76, art. 8), although to avoid confusion we\nperhaps ought to call them definitional parts. The essence of\na universal is usually encoded in its definition. For example, the\ndefinition of Human Being is rational mortal animal.\nAnimal is the genus, and rationality and mortality are the\ndifferentiae.\n\nMany medieval philosophers try to dampen this criticism by suggesting\nthat the universal is, strictly speaking, not composite; it merely\nmimics composition (again, see Ockham Expositio in librum\nPorphyrii 2.16). Perhaps this is a viable response, but there is\nanother problem with the composition requirement: it does not tell us\nwhy all the parts of integral wholes are integral parts. It was\nalready observed in passing that not all parts of an integral whole\nare plausibly components of their wholes. Consider Socrates. The\nelements are strictly what compose Socrates. It is only when Socrates\nis composed that other parts, such as his hands and feet, come into\nexistence. Or put another way, it is false to say that one makes a\nhuman being by cobbling together hands, feet, and head. Such a\ncreature would be Frankenstein\u2019s monster, not a human being.\n\nIn sum, a number of proposals are offered for how one can distinguish\nuniversal wholes from integral wholes. But perhaps no single proposal\nis universally embraced because of the bewildering variety of items\nthat are integral wholes. An obvious solution would be to reduce the\nnumber of items that can be integral wholes or integral parts. And as\nwe have seen already, some philosophers in fact do this in certain\ncases, as when Abelard eliminates temporal wholes. However, based on\nwhat we presently know, no medieval thinker attempts anything like a\nsystematic eliminative project in mereology as such. (Thus, while\nOckham, for instance, famously undertakes a comprehensive and severe\neliminative project in ontology, he does not attempt to develop a\nsystematic theory of what can and what cannot be a part. Rather, for\nhim, the question whether \u201cpart\u201d is being used either\nproperly or figuratively tends to arise within a specific context and\nthe resolution often appears to be developed on a case by case\nbasis.)\n",
