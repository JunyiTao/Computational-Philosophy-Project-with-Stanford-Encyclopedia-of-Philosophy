    "main_text": "The Nature of Fiction\n1. The Nature of Fiction\n\n\nIn whatever way we characterize the fiction/non-fiction distinction,\nthe distinction is widely recognized as important. We care which\ncategory a work belongs to. We read Lord Macaulay\u2019s The\nHistory of England (1848) to learn about the overthrow of James\nII and its aftermath, and criticize Macaulay for departures from fact\nor for bias: these detract from its value as a work of non-fiction.\nHistorical novels such as Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace\n(1865\u20131867) or Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall (2009)\nalso display bias and they depart in numerous ways from fact, but the\nbias and inaccuracies don\u2019t lessen their value as works of\nfiction. And when a writer passes off a work as a work of non-fiction,\ndeliberately hiding the fact that much of its content was made up, we\nsee that as fraudulent. (There are numerous examples. One famous case\nis \u201cJimmy\u2019s World\u201d, written for the Washington Post\nin 1980 by journalist Janet Cooke; the article won her a Pulitzer\nPrize that she later returned.)\n\n\nNot everyone agrees that the distinction matters. Some have argued\nthat all discourse is on a par, that there is no writing that is per\nse fictional or non-fictional. According to Stanley Fish, for example,\n\n\n\n\nwhen we communicate, it is because we are parties to a set of\ndiscourse agreements which are in effect decisions as to what can be\nstipulated as a fact. It is these decisions and the agreement to abide\nby them, rather than the availability of substance, that make it\npossible for us to refer, whether we are novelists or reporters for\nthe New York Times. (Fish 1980: 242) \n\n\nOther writers make much of the fact that even non-fiction writers\nselect and structure what they write about and how they write about\nit. But even if we grant all this, we don\u2019t need to succumb to\nthe kind of skeptical position such authors argue for. It remains the\ncase that fiction writers by and large accept a distinction between\nthe real world and the fictional worlds they generate. The generation\nof such worlds, which often contain individuals, objects, and even\nkinds of objects, that are very different from those in the real\nworld, is not simply a consequence of broad principles about how we\nalways stipulate and select and structure how we see the world. In\nshort, even those inclined to a kind of constructivist anti-realist\nmetaphysics on the basis of the sorts of arguments Fish appeals to\nmight nonetheless still admit a robust fiction/non-fiction\ndistinction.\n",
