    "main_text": "The Course on Positive Philosophy and the Friendship with Mill || Sociology and its double status\n4.3 Sociology and its double status\n\nSociology has a double status. It is not just one science among the\nothers, as though there is the science of society just as there is a\nscience of living beings. Rather, sociology is the science that comes\nafter all the others; and as the final science, it must assume the\ntask of coordinating the development of the whole of knowledge. With\nsociology, positivity takes possession of the last domain that had\nheretofore escaped it and had been considered forever inaccessible to\nit. Many people thought that social phenomena are so complex that\nthere can be no science of them. Dilthey\u2019s idea of\nGeisteswissenschaft, for instance, is explicitly directed\nagainst positivism and maintains the difference between natural\nphilosophy and moral philosophy. On the contrary, according to Comte,\nthis distinction, introduced by the Greeks, is abolished by the\nexistence of sociology, and the unity that was lost with the birth of\nmetaphysics restored (1830 (58), v. 2, 713\u2013715).\n\nFounding social science therefore constitutes a turn in the history of\nhumanity. Until then, the positive spirit was characterized by the\nobjective method, which works its way from the world to man; but as\nthis goal has now been reached, it becomes possible to invert that\ndirection and go from man to world, to adopt, in other words, the\nsubjective method, which so far had been associated with the\nanthropomorphism of theology. To legitimize that method, it suffices\nto substitute sociology for theology, \u2014 which is equivalent to\nsubstituting the relative for the absolute: whereas God may say to the\nsoul, as in the Imitatio, \u201cI am necessary to you and\nyou are useless to me\u201d,\n Humanity[3]\n is the most dependent of all beings. In the first case, to say that\nGod need us is blasphemy: it would be denying his perfection. The\nsecond case is in some respects a mere consequence of the\nclassification of sciences, if we agree to consider humanity as the\nproper object of sociology. Each science depends on the precedent; as\nthe final science, sociology is the most dependent one. Human life\ndepends for instance on astronomical conditions. Humanity depends also\non each of us, on what we do and not do; on another sense, of course,\neach of us depends on humanity, as said by the law of human order:\nles vivants sont n\u00e9cessairement et de plus en plus\ngouvern\u00e9s par les morts.\n\nTo bring out this eminent place of sociology is the principal aim of\nthe General Conclusions of the Course. The 58th\nlesson raises the question of which science presides over the others\non the encyclopedic scale. To guarantee the harmonious development of\nthe various sciences taken together, the dominance of one among them\nhas to be assumed. Until recently, that role had been played by\nmathematics, but \u2018it will not be forgotten that a cradle is not\na throne\u2019 (1830 (58), v. 2, 718; E., v. 2, 510) (Bourdeau 2004).\nOne should distinguish the first blossoming of the positive spirit\nfrom its systematic development. The human point of view, that is to\nsay, the social point of view, is the only one that is truly\nuniversal; now that sociology is born, it is up to it to be in charge\nof the development of knowledge.\n\nIt goes without saying that Comte\u2019s idea of sociology was very\ndifferent from the current one. To ensure the positivity of their\ndiscipline, sociologists have been quick to renounce its coordinating\nfunction, also known as encyclopedic or architectonic function, which\ncharacterizes philosophy. With its place at the top of the scale, the\nsociology of the Course recapitulates the whole of knowledge,\nwhile the sciences that precede it are but one immense introduction to\nthis final science. As a consequence, no one can become a sociologist\nwithout having had a solid encyclopedic education, one that has no\nplace for economics or social mathematics, but, on the contrary,\nemphasizes biology, the first science that deals with organized\nbeings. How far removed this is from today\u2019s sociology\ncurriculum!\n\nIf sociology merges at places with philosophy, it is also closely\nrelated to history. Comte was thus led to take a stand on a question\nthat deeply divides us today: how should the relations among\nphilosophy of science, history of science, and sociology of science be\nseen? In the Course, history is at once everywhere and\nnowhere: it is not a discipline, but the method of sociology. Dynamic\nsociology is \u2018a history without names of men, or even of\npeople\u2019 (1830 (52), v. 2, 239). It is easy to understand, then,\nthat positivism has always refused to separate the philosophy of\nscience from the history of science. According to positivism, one does\nnot really know a science until one knows its history; indeed, it was\na chair in the general history of science that Comte had asked Guizot\nto create for him at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. Mill\u2019s\nposition was not quite the same, for he took the author of the\nCourse to task for neglecting the production of proof, or, to\nuse modern vocabulary, for being more interested in the context of\ndiscovery than in the context of justification (Mill 1865). The\ncriticism is only partly legitimate: from the second lesson in the\nCourse, Comte carefully distinguishes between the doctrinal\nand the historical study of science, opting for the first while\nleaving the second for the lessons in sociology. Just as for Comte the\nphilosophy of science is not a philosophy of nature but of the mind,\nhe likewise values the history of science less as a subject in its own\nright than as the \u2018most important, yet so far most neglected\npart\u2019 of the development of Humanity (1830 (2), v. 1, 53). Each\nscience is therefore examined twice in the Course: for its\nown sake, in the first three volumes; in its relations to the general\ndevelopment of society, in the final three. In this way, Comte\nsucceeds in reconciling the internalist and externalist points of\nview, usually considered to be incompatible.\n",
