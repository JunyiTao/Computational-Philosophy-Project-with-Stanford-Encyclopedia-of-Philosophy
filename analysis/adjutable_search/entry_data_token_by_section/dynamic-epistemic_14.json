    "main_text": "Belief change and Dynamic Epistemic Logic || Evidential dynamics and justified belief\n4.5 Evidential dynamics and justified belief\n\nOne development in DEL is work aimed toward building logics of\nevidence, belief, and knowledge for use in Formal Epistemology. \n\n Vel\u00e1zquez-Quesada (2009) and van Benthem and\nVel\u00e1zquez-Quesada (2010) study logics of inference and update.\nThese have models containing worlds that explicitly list the formulas\nof which agents are \u201caware\u201d, like awareness logics (Fagin\net al. 1995), except that DEL-style modalities can change these\nawareness sets, allowing agents to increase the formulas of which they\nare aware and make inferences with these formulas over time. In this\nsense, the \u201cawareness sets\u201d may be though of as evidence\nfor the formulas the agents presently know. \n Baltag, Renne, and Smets (2014) study a logic of\n\u201cconclusive\u201d (or \u201cgood\u201d) evidence based on a\ncombination of plausibility models with an adaptation of the syntactic\nbookkeeping mechanisms of Justification Logic (Artemov 2008; Artemov\nand Fitting 2012). They argue that their work generalizes the\nawareness logics of Vel\u00e1zquez-Quesada (2009) and van Benthem\nand Vel\u00e1zquez-Quesada (2010) and better addresses updates with\nhigher-order information. \n A different approach to evidence in Dynamic Epistemic Logic was\nproposed by van Benthem and Pacuit (2011a,b) and studied further in\nvan Benthem, Ferna\u0301ndez-Dunque, and Pacuit (2012, 2014). This\napproach is much less syntactic than the Justification Logic-style\napproaches, focusing instead on the semantic notion of modal\n\u201cneighborhood\u201d (or \u201cminimal\u201d) models that have\nbeen repurposed with an evidential twist. \n\n\nWe refer the reader to\n Appendix K\n for further details. \n",
