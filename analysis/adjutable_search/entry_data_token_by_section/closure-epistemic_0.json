The Argument From the Analysis of Knowledge\n\nThe argument from the analysis of knowledge says that the correct\naccount of knowledge leads to K failure. We can distinguish two\nversions. According to the first version, K fails because\nknowledge requires belief tracking. According to the second, any\nrelevant alternatives account, such as Dretske\u2019s and Nozick\u2019s, leads\nto K failure. According to Dretske (2003: 112\u20133; 2005:\n19), any relevant alternatives account leads \u201cnaturally\u201d\nbut \u201cnot inevitably\u201d to K failure. \n",
