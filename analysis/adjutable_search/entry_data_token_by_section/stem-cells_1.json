    "main_text": "The Ethics of Destroying Human Embryos for Research || When does a human being begin to exist?\n1.1 When does a human being begin to exist?\n\n\nA premise of the argument against killing embryos is that human\nembryos are human beings. The issue of when a human being begins\nto exist is, however, a contested one. The standard view of those\nwho oppose HESC research is that a human being begins to exist with the\nemergence of the one-cell zygote at fertilization. At this stage,\nhuman embryos are said to be \u201cwhole living member[s] of the\nspecies homo sapiens \u2026 [which] possess the epigenetic primordia\nfor self-directed growth into adulthood, with their determinateness and\nidentity fully intact\u201d (George & Gomez-Lobo 2002,\n258). This view is sometimes challenged on the grounds that\nmonozygotic twinning is possible until around days 14\u201315 of an\nembryo\u2019s development (Smith & Brogaard 2003). An\nindividual who is an identical twin cannot be numerically identical to\nthe one-cell zygote, since both twins bear the same relationship to the\nzygote, and numerical identity must satisfy transitivity. That\nis, if the zygote, A, divides into two genetically identical cell\ngroups that give rise to identical twins B and C, B and C cannot be the\nsame individual as A because they are not numerically identical with\neach other. This shows that not all persons can correctly assert\nthat they began their life as a zygote. However, it does not\nfollow that the zygote is not a human being, or that it has not\nindividuated. This would follow only if one held that a condition of an\nentity\u2019s status as an individual human being is that it be\nimpossible for it to cease to exist by dividing into two or more\nentities. But this seems implausible. Consider cases in\nwhich we imagine adult humans undergoing fission (for example, along\nthe lines of Parfit\u2019s thought experiments, where each half of the\nbrain is implanted into a different body) (Parfit 1984). The\nprospect of our going out of existence through fission does not pose a\nthreat to our current status as distinct human persons. Likewise,\none might argue, the fact that a zygote may divide does not create\nproblems for the view that the zygote is a distinct human being.\n\n\nThere are, however, other grounds on which some have sought to\nreject that the early human embryo is a human being. According to\none view, the cells that comprise the early embryo are a bundle of\nhomogeneous cells that exist in the same membrane but do not form a\nhuman organism because the cells do not function in a coordinated way\nto regulate and preserve a single life (Smith & Brogaard 2003,\nMcMahan 2002). While each of the cells is alive, they only become\nparts of a human organism when there is substantial cell\ndifferentiation and coordination, which occurs around day-16 after\nfertilization. Thus, on this account, disaggregating the cells of\nthe 5-day embryo to derive HESCs does not entail the destruction of a\nhuman being.\n\n\nThis account is subject to dispute on empirical grounds. That there is\nsome intercellular coordination in the zygote is revealed by the fact\nthat the development of the early embryo requires that some cells\nbecome part of the trophoblast while others become part of the inner\ncell mass. Without some coordination between the cells, there would be\nnothing to prevent all cells from differentiating in the same\ndirection (Damschen, Gomez-Lobo and Schonecker 2006). The question\nremains, though, whether this degree of cellular interaction is\nsufficient to render the early human embryo a human being. Just how\nmuch intercellular coordination must exist for a group of cells to\nconstitute a human organism cannot be resolved by scientific facts\nabout the embryo, but is instead an open metaphysical question\n(McMahan 2007a).\n",
