    "main_text": "\nThe continuum hypothesis (CH) is one of the most central open\nproblems in set theory, one that is important for both mathematical\nand philosophical reasons. \n The problem actually arose with the birth of set theory; indeed,\nin many respects it stimulated the birth of set theory. In 1874 Cantor\nhad shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the\nnatural numbers and the algebraic numbers. More surprisingly, he\nshowed that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the natural\nnumbers and the real numbers. Taking the existence of a one-to-one\ncorrespondence as a criterion for when two sets have the same size\n(something he certainly did by 1878), this result shows that there is\nmore than one level of infinity and thus gave birth to the higher\ninfinite in mathematics. Cantor immediately tried to determine whether\nthere were any infinite sets of real numbers that were\nof intermediate size, that is, whether there was an infinite\nset of real numbers that could not be put into one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the natural numbers and could not be put into\none-to-one correspondence with the real numbers. The continuum\nhypothesis (under one formulation) is simply the statement that\nthere is no such set of real numbers. It was through his attempt to\nprove this hypothesis that led Cantor do develop set theory into a\nsophisticated branch of \nmathematics.[1]\n Despite his efforts Cantor could not resolve CH. The problem\npersisted and was considered so important by Hilbert that he placed it\nfirst on his famous list of open problems to be faced by the\n20th century. Hilbert also struggled to resolve CH,\nagain without success. Ultimately, this lack of progress was explained\nby the combined results of G\u00f6del and Cohen, which together showed\nthat CH cannot be resolved on the basis of the axioms that\nmathematicians were employing; in modern terms, CH is independent of\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory extended with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). \n This independence result was quickly followed by many others. The\nindependence techniques were so powerful that set theorists soon found\nthemselves preoccupied with the meta-theoretic enterprise of proving\nthat certain fundamental statements could not be proved or\nrefuted within ZFC. The question then arose as to whether there were\nways to settle the independent statements. The community of\nmathematicians and philosophers of mathematics was largely divided on\nthis question. The pluralists (like Cohen) maintained that\nthe independence results effectively settled the question by showing\nthat it had no answer. On this view, one could adopt a\nsystem in which, say CH was an axiom and one could adopt a system in\nwhich \u00acCH was an axiom and that was the end of the\nmatter\u2014there was no question as to which of two incompatible\nextensions was the \u201ccorrect\u201d\none. The non-pluralists (like G\u00f6del) held that the\nindependence results merely indicated the paucity of our means for\ncircumscribing mathematical truth. On this view, what was needed were\nnew axioms, axioms that are both justified and sufficient for the\ntask. G\u00f6del actually went further in proposing candidates for new\naxioms\u2014large cardinal axioms\u2014and he conjectured that they\nwould settle CH. \n G\u00f6del's program for large cardinal axioms proved to be\nremarkably successful. Over the course of the next 30 years it was\nshown that large cardinal axioms settle many of the questions that\nwere shown to be independent during the era of independence. However,\nCH was left untouched. The situation turned out to be rather ironic\nsince in the end it was shown (in a sense that can be made precise)\nthat although the standard large cardinal axioms effectively settle\nall question of complexity strictly below that of CH, they cannot (by\nresults of Levy and Solovay and others) settle CH itself. Thus, in\nchoosing CH as a test case for his program, G\u00f6del put his finger\nprecisely on the point where it fails. It is for this reason that CH\ncontinues to play a central role in the search for new axioms. \n In this entry we shall give an overview of the major approaches to\nsettling CH and we shall discuss some of the major foundational\nframeworks which maintain that CH does not have an answer. The subject\nis a large one and we have had to sacrifice full comprehensiveness in\ntwo dimensions. First, we have not been able to discuss the major\nphilosophical issues that are lying in the background. For this the\nreader is directed to the entry \n \u201cLarge Cardinals and Determinacy\u201d, \nwhich contains a general discussion of the\nindependence results, the nature of axioms, the nature of\njustification, and the successes of large cardinal axioms in the realm\n\u201cbelow CH\u201d. Second, we have not been able to discuss every\napproach to CH that is in the literature. Instead we have restricted\nourselves to those approaches that appear most promising from a\nphilosophical point of view and where the mathematics has been\ndeveloped to a sufficiently advanced state. In the approaches we shall\ndiscuss\u2014forcing axioms, inner model theory, quasi-large\ncardinals\u2014the mathematics has been pressed to a very advanced\nstage over the course of 40 years. And this has made our task somewhat\ndifficult. We have tried to keep the discussion as accessible as\npossible and we have placed the more technical items in the\nendnotes. But the reader should bear in mind that we are presenting a\nbird's eye view and that for a higher resolution at any point\nthe reader should dip into the suggested readings that appear at the\nend of each section.[2] \n There are really two kinds of approaches to new\naxioms\u2014the local approach and the global\napproach. On the local approach one seeks axioms that answer questions\nconcerning a specifiable fragment of the universe, such\nas V\u03c9+1 or V\u03c9+2, where\nCH lies. On the global approach one seeks axioms that attempt to\nilluminate the entire structure of the universe of sets. The\nglobal approach is clearly much more challenging. In this entry we\nshall start with the local approach and toward the end we shall\nbriefly touch upon the global approach. \n Here is an overview of the entry: Section 1 surveys the\nindependence results in cardinal arithmetic, covering both the case of\nregular cardinals (where CH lies) and singular cardinals. Section 2\nconsiders approaches to CH where one successively verifies a hierarchy\nof approximations to CH, each of which is an \u201ceffective\u201d\nversion of CH. This approach led to the remarkable discovery of Woodin\nthat it is possible (in the presence of large cardinals) to have an\neffective failure of CH, thereby showing, that the effective failure\nof CH is as intractable (with respect to large cardinal axioms) as CH\nitself. Section 3 continues with the developments that stemmed from\nthis discovery. The centerpiece of the discussion is the discovery of\na \u201ccanonical\u201d model in which CH fails. This formed the\nbasis of a network of results that was collectively presented by\nWoodin as a case for the failure of CH. To present this case in the\nmost streamlined form we introduce the strong logic\n\u03a9-logic. Section 4 takes up the competing foundational view that\nthere is no solution to CH. This view is sharpened in terms of\nthe generic multiverse conception of truth and that view is\nthen scrutinized. Section 5 continues the assessment of the case for\n\u00acCH by investigating a parallel case for CH. In the remaining two\nsections we turn to the global approach to new axioms and here we\nshall be much briefer. Section 6 discusses the approach through inner\nmodel theory. Section 7 discusses the approach through quasi-large\ncardinal axioms. \n",
