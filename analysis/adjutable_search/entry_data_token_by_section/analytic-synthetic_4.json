    "main_text": "High Hopes || Mathematics\n2.1 Mathematics\n\nAs we noted (\u00a71.2), Frege had developed formal logic to account\nfor our apparently a priori knowledge of mathematics. It is\nworth dwelling on the interest of this problem. It is arguably one of\nthe oldest and hardest problems in Western philosophy, and is easy\nenough to understand: ordinarily we acquire knowledge about the world\nby using our senses. If we are interested, for example, in whether\nit\u2019s raining outside, how many birds are on the beach, whether\nfish sleep or stars collapse, we look and see, or turn to others who\ndo. It is a widespread view that Western sciences owe their tremendous\nsuccesses precisely to relying on just such \u201cempirical\u201d\n(experiential, experimental) methods. However, it is also a patent\nfact about all these sciences, and even our ordinary ways of counting\nbirds, fish and stars, that they depend on often immensely\nsophisticated mathematics, and mathematics does not seem to be known\non the basis of experience. Mathematicians don\u2019t do experiments\nin the way that chemists, biologists or other \u201cnatural\nscientists\u201d do. They seem simply to think, seeming to\nrely precisely on the kind of \u201carmchair reflection\u201d to\nwhich many philosophers also aspire. In any case, they don\u2019t try\nto justify their claims by reference to experiments, arguing that\ntwice two is four by noting that pairs of pairs tend in all cases\nobserved so far to be quadruples.\n\nBut how could mere processes of thought issue in any knowledge about\nthe independently existing external world? The belief that it could\nwould seem to involve some kind of mysticism; and, indeed, many\n\u201cnaturalistic\u201d philosophers have felt that the appeals of\n\u201cRationalist\u201d philosophers to some special faculty of\n\u201crational intuition,\u201d such as one finds in philosophers\nlike Plato, Descartes and Leibniz and, more recently, Katz (1988,\n1990), George Bealer (1987) and Laurence Bonjour (1998), these all\nseem no better off than appeals to \u201crevelation\u201d to\nestablish theology. The program of logicism and \u201canalysis\u201d\nseemed to many to offer a more promising, \u201cnaturalistic\u201d\nalternative.\n",
