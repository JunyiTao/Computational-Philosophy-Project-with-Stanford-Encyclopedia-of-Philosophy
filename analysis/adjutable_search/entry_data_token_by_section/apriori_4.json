    "main_text": "What is the nature of a priori justification? || What is the content of intuitive judgments?\n4.2 What is the content of intuitive judgments?\n\nAnna-Sara Malmgren holds that intuitions are certain kinds of\nmental states some of which are candidates as justifiers of\nintuitive judgments that are made in response to\nphilosophical thought experiments (2011: 267\u2013268). What is\nthe content of such intuitive judgments? Malmgren notes that\nthere are several different ways to characterize intuitive judgments,\nbut because they are all controversial, she characterizes them by\nreference to examples. For her, \u201can intuitive judgment is any\njudgment relevantly similar to certain paradigms or examples\u201d\n(Malmgren 2011: 268). Her paradigm examples are of judgments that are\nevoked in Gettier cases where a person is in some sense lucky to have\na true belief given his evidence, Twin Earth cases where a term or\nphrase does not refer to the same thing in different possible worlds,\nand the trolley case where a heavy man is pushed in front of a trolley\nto stop it from running over five people further down the tracks.\nOthers offer as examples the judgment that it is morally permissible\nto unhook a violinist who has been connected to your kidneys without\nyour consent, even if that will kill him (an example made famous by\nJudith Thomson in the abortion debate), the judgment that it is\nirrational for a man who grants that his life in the future will be\nhappy, not a burden on others, virtuous, productive, with many friends\nand adventures, and will otherwise be worthwhile, to refuse to take a\nlife-saving pill (Derek Parfit\u2019s Early Death 2011:\n270-71), and the judgment that it is irrational for a person now not\nto care about his suffering on any future Tuesday just because\nit\u2019s a Tuesday (Parfit\u2019s Future Tuesday\nIndifference 1984: 124).\n\nMalmgren argues against Timothy Williamson\u2019s view that the\ncontent of intuitive judgments involves counterfactual judgments.\nWilliamson says that in typical Gettier cases we make two judgments: a\njudgment that such a case is possible and a counterfactual judgment\nthat if the case had occurred, it would be a case of a justified true\nbelief without knowledge. These two judgments entail that it is\npossible for a person to have a justified true belief without\nknowledge in a situation like that described in the Gettier example\n(Williamson 2004: 110). While Malmgren agrees that a possibility\njudgment is the content of the intuitive judgments in Gettier cases\n(2011: 281), she denies that it need be reached via the counterfactual\njudgment that Williamson proposes.\n\nMalmgren thinks that descriptions of cases in thought experiments are\nincomplete, and that certain ways of completing them are deviant\nbecause they involve interpretations of the cases that misunderstand\nwhat is intended (2011: 274\u2013275). In the famous Nogot/Havit\nGettier case, the issue is whether Smith knows that someone in his\noffice owns a Ford. Smith sees Nogot driving around in a Ford and,\nsay, believes that Nogot has shown him current ownership papers to a\nFord. But Nogot actually drives a rental car, does not own a Ford, and\nhas shown Smith ownership papers to a Ford he used to own. It would be\na deviant understanding of the example to assume also that Smith has\ngood independent evidence that Havit, who also works in his office,\nowns a Ford. Of course, in that case Smith would know that someone in\nhis office owns a Ford. Malmgren thinks that the interpretation that\nassumes that Smith is hallucinating and has a poor memory of what\npapers he has seen is also deviant. In that case, Smith would not be\njustified in believing that Nogot, and so someone in his office, owns\na Ford.\n\nThe intuitive judgment in the case is: it is possible that a person in\na situation like that described in the example has a justified true\nbelief without knowledge. Williamson thinks that this judgment is\nbased on the counterfactual: if the case had occurred, it would be a\ncase of justified true belief without knowledge. But in the deviant\ncases, it would not be a case of justified true belief without\nknowledge, either because it would be a case of knowledge (the extra\nreasons case where Smith has evidence that Havit owns a Ford) or not a\ncase of justified belief (where Smith is hallucinating, has a poor\nmemory, etc.). However, those deviant cases could occur in the\npossible world that is most similar to the actual world, sometimes\ncalled the \u201cnearest possible world\u201d by philosophers.\nBecause of this, as counterfactuals are usually understood by\nphilosophers, what Williamson takes to be the relevant counterfactual\nwould be false. In the nearest possible world where the standard\ndescription of the case holds, the consequent of the counterfactual\nwould be false. So the case would offer no support for the intuitive\nmodal judgment: it is possible that a person has a justified true\nbelief without knowledge. It seems clear to Malmgren that the case\ndoes support that possibility judgment regardless of whether nearby\nworlds are deviant (making the consequent of the relevant\ncounterfactual false) or not (Malmgren 2011: 278\u2013279). So\nWilliamson must be mistaken in thinking that some counterfactual\njudgment must be the basis of the modal intuitive judgment: it is\npossible to have a justified true belief without knowledge in a case\nlike the one described in the example.\n",
