    "main_text": "Virtue\n14. Virtue\n\nMurdoch speaks often of virtue, and she has been treated as an early\nvirtue theorist. Her Sovereignty essays were given exposure\nby inclusion in some early and canonical virtue ethics collections\n(MacIntyre & Hauerwas 1983; Crisp & Slote 1997). While she may\nwell have helped spur interest in virtue within moral philosophy, she\nis not a virtue theorist. She is not putting forward a view that\nvirtue is a more fundamental moral concept than other concepts, nor is\nshe claiming that approaching right action through the lens of virtue\nis superior to doing so through a Kantian/deontological or utilitarian\napproach. She does not offer an \u201cethical theory\u201d in either\nof these senses. Her invocation of virtue reflects an unsystematized\nrecognition that virtue is part of the toolbox we use to understand\nthe moral domain of life, as are attention, perception, love,\nunselfishness, and (in Metaphysics) duty. She joined with\nvirtue theory in helping to expand the scope of ethics beyond\nprocedures and principles of right action to include how it is good to\nlive and to be (against\n point 5).\n",
