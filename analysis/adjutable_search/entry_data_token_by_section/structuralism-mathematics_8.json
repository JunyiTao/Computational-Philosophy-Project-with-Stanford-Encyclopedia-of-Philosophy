    "main_text": "Category-Theoretic Structuralism || Distinctive Features of Categorical Structuralism\n3.3 Distinctive Features of Categorical Structuralism\n\nBeyond the issue of methodological structuralism, the literature on\ncategorical structuralism during the last 20 years centers around two\nquestions that have already been mentioned. First, in what sense does\ncategory theory provide a framework for philosophical structuralism?\nSecond, why is it better suited for that task than other frameworks,\nsuch as set theory, Shapiro\u2019s structure theory, and\nHellman\u2019s modal logic, as has been claimed?  In recent work on\nthese topics, one can find three related philosophical assumptions\nthat characterize categorical structuralism and distinguish it from\nthe versions of structuralism surveyed earlier. We will treat each of\nthem in turn, starting again with Awodey\u2019s writings.\n\nA first characteristic assumption is that all mathematical theorems\nare schematic statements that have a conditional form. This point is\nexplicit in Awodey (2004). We already saw that according to Awodey a\ncategory-theoretic approach is non-foundational in character. This\nincludes that mathematical axioms and theorems, as expressed in\ncategory theory, should be understood as schematic statements. They do\nnot express truths about the specific nature of mathematical objects,\nbut rather, about their respective properties and relations. In\naddition, mathematical theorems are, at least in principle, all of\nhypothetical form. They can be reconstructed as if-then\nstatements. Note that this view of the logical form of mathematical\ntheorems is prima facie similar to the if-then-ism one can\nfind in Putnam\u2019s works, and earlier in Russell\u2019s, as\nmentioned in section 1.\n \n\nHowever, there is also an important difference between standard\nif-then-ism and a category-theoretic approach in terms of the\nontological commitments involved, as Awodey points out. According to\nstandard if-then-ism, any mathematical statement can be translated\ninto a universally quantified conditional statement, where the\nquantifiers are effectively meta-theoretic in nature, ranging over all\nset-theoretic systems of the right type. As such, the approach\npresupposes a rich ontology of sets in which such systems can be\nconstructed. In contrast, along category-theoretic lines mathematical\ntheorems do not involve such ontological commitments. There is no\nimplicit generalization over the Bourbaki structures of a theory,\ne.g., over all groups, rings, or number systems. Rather, a\nmathematical theorem is \u201ca schematic statement about\na structure [\u2026] which can have\nvarious instances\u201d (Awodey 2004: 57).  These instances\nremain undetermined on purpose, unless a further specification of them\nis needed for the proof of the theorem in question.\n\nA second distinctive feature of categorical structuralism, not only\nfor Awodey, concerns a certain \u201ctop-down\u201d conception of\nmathematical objects characteristic for category theory. According to\nstandard set theory, mathematical objects are constructed from the\n\u201cbottom up\u201d, in successive steps starting from some ground\nlevel (the empty set or also a domain of urelements). Every object is\nthus determined, as a set, in terms of its members. In contrast,\nmathematical objects in category theory are characterized in a\ntop-down fashion, starting with the Eilenberg-Mac Lane axioms and\nusing the notion of morphism. Hence, the objects in a given category,\nsuch as that of rings or topological spaces, are not considered\nindependently of the relevant morphisms. They are fully determined by\ntheir mapping properties, as expressible in the language of category\ntheory. Nothing further is assumed about their inner constitution. In\nparticular, questions about their set-theoretic nature are considered\nredundant (see also Landry & Marquis 2005.)\n\nThird, arguably the most important feature of categorical\nstructuralism is that it verifies a version of the\n\u201cstructuralist thesis\u201d (hinted at earlier). Recall here\nBenacerraf\u2019s argument in his 1965 paper that numbers should not\nbe identified with particular sets, but rather, with positions in an\nabstract structure. Benacerraf also emphasizes that only certain\nproperties are relevant in arithmetic.  For him, these are the\nnumber-theoretic properties, such as \u201cbeing prime\u201d or\n\u201cbeing even\u201d, that can be defined in terms of the\nprimitive relations and functions of the theory at issue.  The general\nstructuralist thesis holds, then, that all (relevant) properties of\nthe objects treated by a mathematical theory should be structural in a\nspecified sense. (The question what \u201cstructural\u201d means\nalso came up earlier.)\n\nCategorical structuralists typically argue that category theory\npresents the most adequate framework for a structuralist understanding\nof mathematical objects given that all the properties expressible in\nits language turn out to be structural (see, e.g., McLarty 1993,\nAwodey 2004, and Marquis 2013). This is so because the\ncategory-theoretic study of mathematical objects, such as rings or\ntopological spaces, allows us to express just the right kind of\n\u201cstructural information\u201d, namely information about the\nstructural properties of these objects. In this context, structural\nproperties are usually characterized in terms of the notion of\nisomorphism invariance. Given a category C, a morphism \\(f: A\n\\rightarrow B\\) presents an isomorphism between objects\nA and B if and only if there is a morphism \\(g: B\n\\rightarrow A\\) such that \\(g \\circ f = 1_A\\) and \\(f \\circ g =1_B\\).\nA property P of an object A in category C is then\nstructural if it remains invariant under the isomorphisms in C,\nthat is, if \\(P(A) \\leftrightarrow P(f(A))\\), for all isomorphisms\nf (cf. Awodey 1996).\n\nWe saw above that the representation of mathematical objects in\ntraditional set theory (proceeding \u201cbottom up\u201d) brings\nwith it the possibility to express all sorts of properties about their\nset-theoretical constitution that are not isomorphism invariant in\nthis sense. The central advantage of category theory over classical\nset theory (and similar approaches) is, according to this argument,\nthat such non-structural properties are simply ruled out in the\ncategorical framework. This point was first stressed in\nMcLarty\u2019s \u201cNumbers Can Be Just What They Have To\u201d\n(1993), which, as the title suggests, presents a rejoinder to\nBenacerraf (1965). McLarty\u2019s central thesis in this article is\nthat Benacerraf\u2019s structuralist program is most successfully\nrealized if one considers numbers to be represented in categorical set\ntheory (such as in ETCS or a subsystem thereof), and not in orthodox\nset theory. \n\nTo elaborate this advantage further, number systems of basic\narithmetic can be characterized in such categorical frameworks as\n\u201cnatural number objects\u201d, as was first shown by\nLawvere. In contrast to their ZFC-based representation, such objects\nare not just isomorphic but share \u201cexactly the same\nproperties\u201d, namely those expressible in the language of the\ncategory of sets. In other words, any two natural number objects are\n\u201cprovably indiscernible\u201d, in the sense that they\n\u201cprovably have the same properties\u201d (McLarty\n1993). Moreover, all of these properties are structural in the above\nsense. As a consequence, Benacerraf\u2019s dilemma of isomorphic\nnumbers systems with different set-theoretic properties does not arise\nin the context of categorical set theory. The conclusion is that\nnumbers can, after all, be identified with sets, but with structural\nones as defined in ETCS.\n\nAs McLarty and others have argued, this observation generalizes from\nnumbers to all other mathematical objects studied in category theory.\nThe claim is that any property of the objects in a given category that\nis expressible in the language of category theory is structural in the\nsense of being isomorphism invariant. The main consequence for a\nstructuralist conception of mathematical objects is summarized by\nAwodey as follows: \n\n\nSince all categorical properties are thus structural, the only\nproperties which a given object in a given category may have, qua\nobject in that category, are structural ones. (Awodey 1996: 214) \n\n\nThis would seem to illustrate a main advantage of categorical forms of\nstructuralism over set-theoretic and similar ones.\n\nA rejoinder should be added, however. McLarty\u2019s and\nAwodey\u2019s claim that all mathematical properties expressible in\ncategorical set theory are isomorphism invariant has been contested,\ne.g., in Tsementzis (2017). In fact, Tsementzis argues that neither\nZFC nor ETCS provide fully structuralist foundations for mathematics,\nsince their respective languages do not, after all, exclusively allow\nfor the formulation of invariant properties. Then again, both\nMakkai\u2019s FOLDS system (Makkai 1995, Other Internet Resources,\n1998) and the Univalent Foundations program developed in Homotopy Type\nTheory (Univalent Foundations Program 2013) seem to meet this\ncondition. Here we have reached another ongoing debate in the\nliterature.\n\nThe technical results just mentioned are clearly relevant for our\ndiscussion, but we cannot explore them further in this general survey.\n(Cf. Awodey 2014 for more on the relation between structuralism and\nthe Univalent Foundations project.) We also have to leave a further,\nmore definite evaluation of the philosophical claims and arguments\nconcerning categorical structuralism to another occasion, interesting\nand important as that debate is. Instead, we now conclude with some\nmore general remarks about structuralism, even beyond the philosophy\nof mathematics.\n",
