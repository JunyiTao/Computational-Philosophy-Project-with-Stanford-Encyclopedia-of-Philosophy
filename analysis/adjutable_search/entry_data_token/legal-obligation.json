This is no accident: obligations are central to\nthe social role of law and explaining them is necessary to an\nunderstanding of law\u2019s authority and, therefore, its nature. Not\nonly are there obligations in the law, there are also\nobligations to the law. Historically, most philosophers\nagreed that these include a moral obligation to obey, or what\nis usually called \u201cpolitical obligation\u201d. For some, this\nis the consequence of some sort of transaction we enter with the\nstate. Since states provide us with crucially important benefits, we\nincur certain duties in return, either because we consent to incurring\nthese duties in exchange for the benefits, or because it would be\nunfair or ungrateful not to reciprocate for them. Other accounts are\nnon-transactional in nature, and ground political obligation in the\nfact that obeying the law enhances our ability to do what we have\nreason to do, in the fact that we have duties to maintain just legal\nsystems, or in special responsibilities qua members of our political\ncommunity. All these lines of argument have been subjected to thorough\ncriticism, and this has led some to deny that law is entitled to all\nthe authority it claims for itself, even when the legal system is\nlegitimate and reasonably just. On this view there are legal\nobligations that some of law\u2019s subjects have no moral obligation\nto perform.\n", "toc": [{"#ObliLaw": "1. Obligations in the Law"}, {"#AuthObliLegi": "2.

Obligations in the Law\n\nEvery legal system contains obligation-imposing laws, but there is no\ndecisive linguistic marker determining which these are. The term\n\u201cobligation\u201d need not be used, nor its near-synonym,\n\u201cduty\u201d. One rarely finds the imperative mood. The Canadian\nCriminal Code imposes an obligation not to advocate genocide thus:\n\n\nEvery one who advocates or promotes genocide is guilty of an\nindictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding\nfive years.\n\n\nThe English Sale of Goods Act says that,\n\n\nWhere the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there is an\nimplied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are of\nmerchantable quality.\n\n\nThat these laws create obligations follows from the way\n\u201coffence\u201d and \u201cimplied condition\u201d function in\ntheir respective areas of law, not from the language in which they are\nexpressed.\n\nOn the face of it, some laws have other functions. A requirement that\n\u201ca will must be signed\u201d generally imposes no\nduty\u2014not a duty to make a will, and not even a duty to have it\nsigned if you do\u2014it sets conditions in the absence of which the\ndocument simply does not count as a valid will. Nonetheless, some\nphilosophers argue that the content of every legal system can and\nshould be represented solely in terms of duty-imposing and\nduty-excepting laws (Bentham Of Laws in General; Kelsen 1960\n[1967]). Bentham asks,\n\n\nWhat is it that every article of law has in common with the rest? It\ncommands and by doing so creates duties or, what is another\nword for the same thing, obligations. (Bentham, Of Laws\nin General [1970: 294])\n\n\n(For a related contemporary view, see Harris 1979: 84\u2013106.) They\nthink that analysing laws this way reveals what legislators or\nsubjects most need to know: under what conditions the coercive power\nof law will ultimately be met. Others argue that even if such a\nreduction were possible, it would be unwieldy, uninformative and\nunmotivated, concealing as it does the different social functions that\nlaws fulfil (Hart 1961 [1994: 26\u201349]) and the different kinds of\nreasons for action that they create (Raz 1975 [1990]). Others still,\ndespairing of any principled way of knowing what a law is, have\nabandoned the problem entirely and tried to develop a theory of law\nthat bypasses it (Honor\u00e9 1977; Dworkin 1978: 71\u201378). At a\nminimum, it does seem clear that whether or not all laws impose\nobligations, they can only be fully understood through their\nrelations to those that do. Thus, a legal right is an interest that\nwarrants holding others under an obligation to protect it, a legal\npower is the ability to create or modify obligations, and so\nforth.\n\nWhat then are legal obligations? They are legal requirements with\nwhich law\u2019s subjects are bound to conform. An\nobligatory act or omission is something the law renders non-optional.\nSince people plainly can violate their legal obligations,\n\u201cnon-optional\u201d does not mean that they are physically\ncompelled to perform, nor even that law leaves them without any\neligible alternative. On the contrary, people often calculate whether\nor not to perform their legal duties. Could it be then that\nobligations are simply weighty reasons to perform, even if sometimes\nneglected or outweighed? This cannot be a sufficient condition: high\ncourts have important reasons not to reverse themselves too\nfrequently, but no legal obligation to refrain. Nor is it necessary:\none has an obligation, but only a trivial reason, not to tread on\nsomeone\u2019s lawn without his consent.\n\nIf their content does not account for the stringency of obligations,\nwhat does? An historically important, though now largely defunct,\ntheory explained it in terms of penalty. According to this view, to\nhave a legal obligation is to be subject to a sovereign command to do\nor forbear, where a command requires an expression of will together\nwith an attached risk, however small, of suffering an evil for\nnon-compliance. As the English jurist John Austin puts it,\n\n\n[w]hen I am talking directly of the chance of incurring the\nevil, or (changing the expression) of the liability or obnoxiousness\nto the evil, I employ the term duty, or the term\nobligation\u2026. (Austin 1832 [1995: 18]; see also Bentham\nOf Laws in General; Hobbes 1651 [1968])\n\n\nOthers conceived an indirect connection between duty and sanction,\nholding that what is normally counted as the content of a legal duty\nis in reality only part of a triggering condition for the mandatory\nnorm which commands or authorizes officials to impose a sanction.\nAccording to this view,\n\n\na norm: \u201cYou shall not murder\u201d is superfluous, if a norm\nis valid: \u201cHe who murders ought to be punished\u201d. (Kelsen\n1960 [1967: 55])\n\n\nThus,\n\n\n[l]egal obligation is not, or not immediately, the behavior that ought\nto be. Only the coercive act, functioning as a sanction, ought to be.\n(Kelsen 1960 [1967: 119])\n\n\nNone of these versions of the sanction theory survived H.L.A.\nHart\u2019s criticisms (Hart 1961 [1994: 27\u201342]; cf. Hacker\n1973; but see Schauer 2015 for a recent reformulation of this\napproach). First, they misleadingly represent a range of disparate\nlegal consequences\u2014including compensation and even\ninvalidation\u2014as if they all function as penalties. Second, they\nrender unintelligible many familiar references to duties in the\nabsence of sanctions, for example, the duty of the highest courts to\napply the law. Third, they offer an inadequate explanation of\nnon-optionality. \u201cYou have an obligation not to murder\u201d\ncannot merely mean \u201cIf you murder you will be punished\u201d,\nfor the law is not indifferent between people, on the one hand,\nmurdering and being jailed, and on the other hand not murdering at\nall. \u201cThe right to disobey the law is not obtainable by the\npayment of a penalty or a licence fee\u201d (Francome v. Mirror\nGroup Newspapers Ltd. [1984] 2 All ER 408 at 412). Such dicta are\ncommonplace and reflect familiar judicial attitudes. Most important,\nthe normal function of sanctions in the law is to reinforce duties,\nnot to constitute them. It is true that one reason people are\ninterested in knowing their legal duties is to avoid sanctions, but\nthis is not the only reason nor is it, contrary to what Oliver Wendell\nHolmes supposed, a theoretically primary one (Holmes 1897). Subjects\nalso want to be guided by their duties\u2014whether in order\nto fulfil them or deliberately to infringe them\u2014and officials\ninvoke them as reasons for, and not merely consequences of,\ntheir decisions.\n\nSensitivity to such matters led Hart to defend a rule-based\ntheory. He says that while sanctions might mark circumstances in which\npeople are obliged to conform, they have an\nobligation only when subject to a practised social rule requiring\nan act or omission. The fact that subjects use it as a rule marks it\nas normative. Three further features distinguish obligation-imposing\nrules: they must be reinforced by serious or insistent pressure to\nconform; they must be believed important to social life or to some\nvalued aspect of it; and their requirements may conflict with the\ninterests and goals of the subject (Hart 1961 [1994: 85\u201388]).\nThis account of the nature of obligations is not an account\nof their validity. Hart does not say that a legal duty is\nbinding whenever there is a willingness to deploy serious pressure in\nits support, etc. He holds that a duty is legally valid if it is part\nof the legal system (i.e., if it is certified as such by the tests for\nlaw in that system), and a legal duty is morally valid only if there\nare sound moral reasons to comply with it. But, at least in his early\nwork, he offers the practice theory as an explanation of duties\ngenerally\u2014legal duties are the creatures of legal rules, moral\nduties of moral rules and so on. (Hart later modified this view, see\n1982: 255\u2013268; and 1961 [1994: 256].)\n\nThe constitutive role of social pressure is sometimes considered an\nAustinian blemish on Hart\u2019s theory, but there are in any case\nmore serious problems with it as a general account of obligations\n(Dworkin 1978: 50\u201354; Raz 1975 [1990: 53\u201358]). People\nreadily speak of obligations when they are well aware that there are\nno relevant social practices, as might a lone vegetarian in a meat\neating society. And Hart\u2019s practice conditions may be satisfied\nin cases where there is no obligation but only generally applicable\nreasons, as when victims are regularly urged to yield their wallets to\na mugger. At best, Hart\u2019s theory will apply only to a special\nclass of obligations in which the existence of a conventional practice\nis an essential part of the reasons for conformity, though even here,\nthe theory is open to doubt (see Dworkin 1978: 54\u201358; Green\n1988: 88\u2013121; cf. Marmor 2011: ch. 3). More recently, some have\nobjected that Hart\u2019s attempt to reduce social rules to social\npractices fails because rules and practices belong to different\nmetaphysical categories. If so, grounding one in the other is a\ncategory mistake. Instead, we should think of the rules of our legal\nsystem as grounded in the planning activities of various officials\nwhose intent is to regulate the behaviour of individuals (as well as\nother bodies) operating within the legal system (Shapiro 2011).\n\nA third account is reason-based. On this view, what\nconstitutes obligations is neither the social resources with which\nthey are enforced, nor the practices in which they may be expressed,\nbut the kind of reasons for action that they offer. Legal obligations\nare content-independent reasons that are both categorical and\npre-emptive in force. The mark of their content-independence is that\ntheir force does not depend on the nature or merits of the action they\nrequire: in most cases, law can impose an obligation to do X\nor to refrain from doing X (Hart 1958; 1982: 254\u201355;\nbut cf. Markwick 2000; Sciaraffa 2009; Valentini 2018). That they are\npre-emptive means that they require the subject to set aside his own\nview of the merits and comply nonetheless. That they are categorical\nmeans that they do not condition their claims on the subject\u2019s\nown goals or interests.\n\nThis view is foreshadowed both in Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, but\nits most influential contemporary version is due to Joseph Raz (1975\n[1990: 35\u201384]). Raz argues that obligations are categorical\nreasons for action that are \u201cprotected\u201d insofar as they\nare combined with special second-order reasons that require\nus to exclude from our deliberation some of the competing first\norder reasons for action. \u201cFirst-order reasons\u201d are\nnormal reasons for action grounded in self-interest, desires or\nmorality; \u201csecond-order reasons\u201d are reasons that we have\nto act (or refrain from acting) on first-order reasons. Thus, the\ndistinctive feature of obligations, according to Raz, is that they\nexclude some contrary reasons\u2014typically at least\nreasons of convenience and ordinary preference\u2014from our\npractical deliberation. Some but not all. An \u201cexclusionary\nreason\u201d is not necessarily a conclusive reason. The stringency\nof an obligation is thus a consequence not of its weight or practice\nfeatures, but of the fact that it supports the required action by\nspecial normative means, insulating it from the general competition of\nreasons. Or at any rate this is what obligations do when they have the\nforce they claim, i.e., when they are binding. The theory does not\nassume that all legal obligations actually are binding from the moral\npoint of view, but it does suppose that the legal system puts them\nforth as if they were\u2014a consequence that some have doubted (Hart\n1982: 263\u2013267; Himma 2001: 284\u2013297). And while this\naccount is invulnerable to the objections to sanction-based and\npractice-based theories, it does need to make good the general idea of\nan \u201cexclusionary reason\u201d, and some philosophers have\nexpressed doubts on that score also.\n\nSome have criticized the very existence of reasons to act for (or\nagainst) other reasons by pointing out that acting for (or against)\nother reasons is not something we can choose to do (Whiting 2017;\nAdams 2021). Others have pointed out that the reasons provided by\nauthoritative directives are best understood as reasons that causally\nconstrain our capacity not to conform with the directives in question\n(Shapiro 2002). Others have argued that what Raz calls exclusionary\nreasons are ultimately simply reasons that outweigh competing reasons\n(Mian 2002), reasons that affect the weight of first order reasons\n(Perry 1989) or reasons that causally change the factual circumstances\nin a way that triggers pre-existing reasons (Enoch 2011 and 2014).\nFinally, others have accepted that exclusionary reasons exist, while\nrejecting the claim that it is ever reasonable to exclude\nentirely from consideration otherwise valid reasons (Regan\n1987; Gur 2007). This has led to formulation of alternative models,\naccording to which obligations are best understood as providing\n\u201cpresumptive reasons\u201d, as opposed to exclusionary reasons\nfor action (Schauer 1991; Renzo 2019). According to these models,\ncompeting reasons for action are not excluded altogether from the\ndeliberation of the agent. Rather, the second-order reasons created by\nthe obligation merely create a presumption in favour of their\nexclusion. Subject to certain epistemic conditions being met, the\npresumption can be rebutted (but see Venezia 2020).\n2. Authority, Obligation, and Legitimacy\n\nA competitive market is not a legal system, even though people adjust\ntheir behaviour in response to relative prices and the whole\nconstitutes a form of social order. Neither was the system of mutual\nnuclear deterrence, though it guided behaviour and generated norms\nthat regulated the Cold War. Many philosophers and social scientists\nagree that a social order is a legal system only if it has effective\nauthority. An effective (or de facto) authority may\nnot be justified, but it does stand in a special relation to justified\n(de jure) authority. Justified authority is what effective\nauthorities claim, or what they are generally recognized to have.\n\nWhat is legal authority, and how is it related to obligations? It is a\nkind of practical authority, i.e., authority over action. On one\ninfluential view, \u201cTo claim authority is to claim the right to\nbe obeyed\u201d (R. P. Wolff 1970: 5). There are, of course,\nauthorities that make no such claim. Theoretical authorities, i.e.,\nexperts, are not characterized by claims to obedience. They need not\neven claim a right to be believed. And there are weaker forms of\npractical authority. To give someone authority to use your car is\nmerely to permit him. But political authority, of which legal\nauthority is one species, is normally seen as a right to rule, with a\ncorrelative duty to obey. On this account law claims the right to\nobedience wherever it sets out obligations. And to obey is not merely\nto comply with the law; it is to be guided by it. Max Weber\nsays it is\n\n\nas if the ruled had made the content of the command the maxim of their\nconduct for its very own sake. (Weber 1922 [1963: II 946])\n\n\nOr, as Robert Paul Wolff somewhat more perspicuously puts it:\n\n\nObedience is not a matter of doing what someone tells you to do. It is\na matter of doing what he tells you to do because he tells you to\ndo it. (R. P. Wolff 1970: 9)\n\n\nThis is not to say that one obeys only in treating the\nauthority\u2019s say-so as an indefeasible reason for action; but one\nmust treat as a binding content-independent reason. The question\nwhether there is an obligation of obedience to law is a matter of\nwhether we should act from the legal point of view and obey the law as\nit claims to be obeyed (Raz 1979: 233\u2013249).\n\nIt is an interesting feature of this account that it supposes that one\ncan tell what the authority requires independent of whether the\nrequirement is justified on its merits. Indeed, one might argue\nthat\n\n\nif there is no way of telling whether an utterance is authoritative,\nexcept by evaluating its contents to see whether it deserves to be\naccepted in its own right, then the distinction between an\nauthoritative utterance and advice or rational persuasion will have\ncollapsed. (Friedman 1973: 132)\n\n\nAn idea of this sort is developed by Raz into one of the leading\narguments for the \u201csources thesis\u201d, the idea that an\nadequate test for the existence and content of law must be based only\non social facts, and not on moral arguments. (See the entry on\n legal positivism.)\n Authority\u2019s subjects\n\n\ncan benefit by its decisions only if they can establish their\nexistence and content in ways which do not depend on raising the very\nsame issues which the authority is there to settle. (Raz 1994:\n219)\n\n\nIf law aims to settle disputes about moral issues, then law must be\nidentifiable without resolving these same disputes. The law is\ntherefore exhausted by its sources (such as legislative\nenactments, judicial decisions, and customs, together with local\nconventions of interpretation). This kind of argument has been\ngeneralized (see Shapiro 1998), but also subjected to criticism. It is\nuncertain what sort of constraint is posed by the idea that it should\nnot involve \u201cthe very same issues\u201d\u2014perhaps if\nmorality is a necessary condition only there could be moral tests for\nauthority that leave the relevant dependent reasons untouched (Coleman\n2001: 126\u2013127). And while law does indeed serve as a scheme for\nguiding and appraising behaviour, it may also have other functions,\nsuch as educating its subjects about right and wrong, and this may be\nill-served the attitude that the rules are to be obeyed in part\nbecause they are the rules (Waluchow 1994).\n\nThe obligation-correlative view of authority is not universally\naccepted. Some argue that the power to impose moral obligations is\nonly one of the many ways in which political authorities have the\ncapacity to shape the normative status of those subject to them. The\ndistinctive feature of political authority, according to this\napproach, is the broader power unilaterally change the duties,\nliberties and claim-rights of their subjects (Copp 1999 and Perry\n2012). Others argue that political authority involves no claim right,\nbut only a set of liberties: to decide certain questions for a society\nand to enforce their decisions. (Soper 2002: 85 ff; cf. Ladenson 1980;\nGreenawalt 1987: 47\u201361; and Edmundson 1998: 7\u201370).\n\nThe liberty conception must answer two questions. First, is it not a\nfeature of a right to decide that it requires subjects to refrain from\nacting on competing decisions? If the law says that abortion is\npermissible and the Church says that it is not, what does the denial\nof the Church\u2019s right to decide amount to if not that public\npolicy should be structured by the former decision and not the latter,\neven if the latter is correct? Second, does the right to enforce\ninclude a duty of subjects to pay the penalty when required? If it\ndoes, then this is only a truncated version of the\nobligation-correlative theory\u2014one that holds that punitive and\nremedial obligations, but not primary obligations, are binding. If\nnot, it is starkly at variance with the actual views of legal\nofficials, who do not think that subjects are at liberty to evade\npenalties if they can.\n\nThis reaches a methodological issue in the philosophy of law. Some\nconsider that the character of law\u2019s authority is a matter for\ndescriptive analysis fixed by semantic and logical constraints of\nofficial language and traditions of argument. Others maintain that\nsuch analysis is impossible or indeterminate, and that we are\ntherefore driven to normative arguments about what legal authority\nshould be (see Soper 2002; Finnis 1979: 12\u201315). Crudely put,\nthey think that we should understand law to claim only the sort of\nauthority it would be justifiable for law to have. Such is the\nmotivation for Friedrich Hayek\u2019s suggestion that\n\n\nThe ideal type of law \u2026 provides merely additional information\nto be taken into account in the decision of the actor. (Hayek 1960:\n150)\n\n\nHayek favours the free market, and concludes that the nature of legal\nauthority should be understood analogically. The most radical position\nof this sort is Ronald Dworkin\u2019s. He prefers what he calls a\n\u201cmore relaxed\u201d understanding of legal authority (Dworkin\n1986: 429). Others have argued that the pre-emptive notion of\nauthority is unsatisfactory because it is too rigid (e.g., Perry\n1989). Dworkin\u2019s objection runs much deeper. His position is not\nthat law communicates only a weaker form of guidance; it is that law\nis not to be understood as trying to communicate anything at all. A\nsubject considering his legal duties is not listening to the law; he\nis engaged in \u201ca conversation with oneself\u201d, and is\n\u201ctrying to discover his own intention in maintaining and\nparticipating in that practice\u201d (Dworkin 1986: 58). On this view\nthere is no fact of the matter about what law claims that is\nindependent of what each does well to regard it as claiming.\n\nHowever we resolve the methodological question, there are two parallel\nnormative questions:\n\nThe problem of obligation: What if anything justifies the\nduty to obey the law, and how far does that obedience properly\nextend?\nThe problem of legitimacy: What if anything justifies the\ncoercive power of law, and how far may that power properly\nextend?\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between these? Some maintain that obligation\ncomes first:\n\n\n[T]hough obligation is not a sufficient condition for coercion, it is\nclose to a necessary one. A state may have good grounds in some\nspecial circumstances for coercing those who have no duty to obey. But\nno general policy of upholding the law with steel could be justified\nif the law were not, in general, a source of genuine obligations.\n(Dworkin 1986: 191)\n\n\nThe idea is that merely having justice on one\u2019s side is an\ninadequate ground for coercing others; one also needs a special title\nflowing from the moral status of the law. (Contrast, for example,\nLocke\u2019s view that everyone has an \u201cexecutive power of the\nlaw of nature\u201d, at least outside political society [Second\nTreatise, \u00a7 13].)\n\nOthers contend that this gets the relationship backwards. First, it is\ndoubtful whether one could have an obligation to obey an illegitimate\nregime. We might think that \u201cacquiescence in, or even consent\nto, clearly unjust institutions does not give rise to\nobligations\u201d (Rawls 1971: 343; but cf. Simmons 1979:\n78\u201379). If so, at least some conditions of legitimacy precede an\nobligation of obedience. Second, there are substantive reasons for\nthinking we would not have obligations to obey if the law were not\nalready justified in upholding its requirements \u201cwith\nsteel\u201d. A legal system that could not justifiably coerce could\nnot assure the law-abiding that the recalcitrant will not take them\nfor suckers. Without being able to solve this assurance problem it\nwould be unjust to impose obligations on them, and unjust to demand\ntheir obedience. Underlying this suggestion is that idea that familiar\nidea that effectiveness is a necessary\u2014but certainly not\nsufficient\u2014condition for justified authority. (See Kelsen 1960\n[1967: 46\u201350]; cf. Finnis 1979: 250. For an alternative\nformulation of the view that there can be no duty to obey until we\nhave established the right of the authority to coerce, see Ripstein\n2004.)\n3. Obligations to the Law\n\nIt may affirm our confidence in the obligation-correlative view to\nknow that from earliest times philosophical reflection on political\nauthority has focused on the obligation to obey. The passive\nobligation of obedience is certainly not all we owe the law (Parekh\n1993: 243; Green 2002: 543\u2013547) but many have taken it to be\nlaw\u2019s minimum demand. This gives rise to a puzzle. As Robert\nPaul Wolff puts it:\n\n\nIf the individual retains his autonomy by reserving to himself in each\ninstance the final decision whether to co-operate, he thereby denies\nthe authority of the state; if, on the other hand, he submits to the\nstate and accepts is claim to authority then \u2026 he loses his\nautonomy. (R. P. Wolff 1970: 9)\n\n\nWolff resolves the dilemma in favour of autonomy, and on that basis\ndefends anarchism.\n\nSome of Wolff\u2019s worries flow from the \u201csurrender of\njudgement\u201d itself\u2014how can it ever be rational to act\nagainst reason as one sees it? Others flow from the fact that it is a\nsurrender to the law. On the first point, it is relevant to\nnotice that promises and contracts also involve surrender of judgement\nand a kind of deference to others (see Soper 2002: 103\u2013139), yet\na rational anarchist needs such voluntary commitments to substitute\nfor authoritative ordering. A principled objection to every surrender\nof judgement is thus self-defeating. Moreover, there seem to be cases\nin which by surrendering judgement on some matters one can secure more\ntime and resources for reflection and decision on things that are more\nimportant, or with respect to which one has greater capacity for\nself-direction. A partial surrender of judgement may therefore enhance\nthe agent\u2019s autonomy overall.\n\nThis suggests that Wolff\u2019s concern is better understood as\nscepticism about whether it is justifiable to surrender one\u2019s\njudgement wholesale to the law. Some philosophers have queried the\nintelligibility of this doubt; they say that it is of the\nnature of law that there is an obligation to obey it, at\nleast in its central case (Fuller 1958 [2000: 100]; Finnis 1979:\n14\u201315). Some go so far as to conclude that it is therefore\nabsurd to ask for any ground of the duty to obey the law: law\nis that which is to be obeyed (McPherson 1967: 64). We need a way into\nthis circle, and the best entrance is in specifying the nature of law\nin away compatible with various theories of its nature. Three features\nare especially important (drawing on Hart 1961 [1994: 193\u2013200];\nRaz 1975 [1990: 149\u2013154]; and Lyons 1984: 66\u201368). First,\nlaw is institutionalized: nothing is law that is not\nconnected with the activities of institutions such as legislatures,\ncourts, administrators, police, etc. Second, legal systems have a\nwide scope. Law not limited to the affairs of small\nface-to-face groups such as families or clans, nor does it only attend\nto a restricted domain of life such as baseball. Law governs\nopen-ended domains of large, loosely structured groups of strangers\nand it regulates their most urgent interests: life, liberty, property,\nkinship, etc. But although law necessarily deals with moral matters,\nit does not necessarily do so well, and this is its third central\nfeature: law is morally fallible. This is acknowledged by\nboth positivists and natural lawyers, whose slogan \u201can unjust\nlaw is not a law\u201d was never intended to assert the infallibility\nof law.\n\nThe question of political obligation, then, turns on whether there is\nare moral reasons to obey the mandatory requirements of a\nwide-ranging, morally fallible, institutionalized authority. This\nobligation purports to be comprehensive in that it covers all legal\nobligations and everyone whose compliance the law requires. It is not\nassumed to bind come what may, though it is to be one genuine\nobligation among others. Some philosophers also consider that it\nshould bind people particularly to their own states, i.e., the states\nof which they are residents or citizens, and that an argument that\ncould not show that one had more stringent duties to obey one\u2019s\nown country than a similarly just foreign one would be in that measure\ndeficient (Simmons 1979: 31\u201335; Green 1988: 227\u2013228).\nFinally, it is common ground the obligation exists only when a\nthreshold condition of justice is met.\n4. Transactional Theories\n\nTwo main strategies are traditionally employed in justifying political\nobligation. One appeals to some sort of transaction existing between\nthe state and its members; the other appeals to specific sets of\nduties that individuals have either simply qua moral agents, or in\nvirtue of particular positions they occupy. We will start by\nconsidering the first one.\n4.1 Consent\n\n\u201cThe Right of all Sovereigns\u201d, says Hobbes in\nLeviathan (chap. 42) \u201cis derived originally from the\nconsent of everyone of those that are to be governed\u201d. In the\nSecond Treatise (\u00a7 95) Locke says:\n\n\nMen being \u2026 by nature all free, equal, and independent, no one\ncan be put out of this estate and subjected to the political power of\nanother without his own consent.\n\n\nThe ideological influence of such theories in the struggles for\nrepresentative government and decolonization was immense. Few now\ndeny, in the words of the United States\u2019 Declaration of\nIndependence, that all governments \u201cderiv[e] their just\npowers from the consent of the governed\u201d, and it is perhaps not\ntoo much to say that consent has become the \u201cgold\nstandard\u201d for political authority (and, indeed, for a\ntheory of any political power; Buchanan 2002).\n\nBut whose consent, and to what? Not the consent of our ancestors, for\nsuch an \u201coriginal\u201d contract, as it was called in the\nseventeenth century, can have no authority over those who did not\nagree to it. A voluntarist theory requires the actual consent of each\nsubject. But this cannot mean consent to every law or application\nthereof. The evident absurdity of that idea leads some to declare\nconsent \u201cintrinsically implausible\u201d: As Finnis puts\nit,\n\n\nthe need for authority is, precisely, to substitute for unanimity in\ndetermining the solution of practical co-ordination problems which\ninvolve or concern everyone in the community. (Finnis 1979: 248)\n\n\nConsent theorists, however, have not generally proposed the principle\nas a solution to \u201cpractical co-ordination problems\u201d.\nUnanimous consent would be a very bad decision rule: the\ntransaction costs would be enormous and hold-outs could block many\ndesirable policies. Consent is more commonly proposed as a part of the\nconstitution rule that sets up the political community in the\nfirst place. Consent theorists reject, therefore, Immanuel\nKant\u2019s idea (discussed below) that the mere capacity of\nA to violently affect B\u2019s interests is\nsufficient licence for anyone to subject them both to a regime of\npositive law (the Metaphysics of Morals \u00a7 44). For\nconsent theorists, an A-B interaction does not\nbecome a candidate for authoritative regulation until\nA and B agree to unite under one jurisdiction. We\ncannot ask which or what sort of authority is justified over both the\nKurds and the Shiites in Iraq until we answer why there should be one\nat all. Beyond this foundational role, however, consent theorists take\ndifferent views of whether it has any further significance in policy.\nLocke thinks it is then displaced by majority rule by delegates as the\nnatural procedure for most decisions; for Rousseau, this is but\nanother form of slavery.\n\nEven in its confined role, however, consent has attracted powerful\ncriticism. (For a good survey see Simmons 1979: 57\u2013100; for a\nqualified defence see Beran 1987.) Much of it has focused on the\nquestions of whether consent is in fact given and, if given, whether\nit would bind. The first thing to notice is that here consent is meant\nto be a performative commitment that undertakes an obligation through\nthe very act of consenting. Thus, it is closer to how we normally\nunderstand the notion of a promise, rather than to how consent is used\nin other contexts. (When you consent to surgery, for example, you\ndon\u2019t incur an obligation to undergo surgery. You simply waive\nyour objection to undergoing surgery.) Like other promises and oaths,\nhowever, there are limits to the validity of consent. Not only because\nconsent is invalid if secured via coercion, manipulation or duress,\nbut also because there are things we lack the moral power to consent\nto. Locke, for example, argues that one can consent neither to be\nkilled nor to slavery, and thus not to anything tantamount to slavery,\nincluding absolute government. One can imagine a similar argument to\nthe conclusion that political consent must be revocable. But as we\nbuild in all these validity conditions, the commitment itself seems to\nbe doing less and less work, leading some to conclude it becomes\n\u201cessentially irrelevant\u201d (Pitkin 1965 [1972: 57]). Consent\nis saved from irrelevance only if we can explain why we also\nvalue a power to bind ourselves to obey. David Hume could conceive no\nreason at all: promise-keeping is an \u201cartificial virtue\u201d\nserving the public good, just like obedience to law. So long as law is\ntolerably legitimate\u2014and Hume is prepared to give it a very wide\nberth\u2014a promise to obey is redundant, for any plausible answer\nto the question of why we are bound by the promise would\n\u201cimmediately, without any circuit, have accounted for our\nobligation to allegiance\u201d; \u201cbeing of like force and\nauthority, we gain nothing by resolving the one into the other\u201d\n(Hume 1748 [1985: 481]).\n\nNow, whilst a consent theory need not \u201cresolve\u201d allegiance\ninto a promise\u2014there may also be non-promissory conditions on\nobedience\u2014, it must explain why it should be conditional on it.\nThree sorts of arguments have been popular. First, there are\ninstrumental reasons for wanting deliberate control over the liability\nto legal duties. In political authority, where the stakes are as high\nas they come, the power to give and withhold consent serves an\nultimate protective function beyond what we could expect from the\nfallible institutions of limited government. Second, consent enables\npeople to establish political allegiances by creating new political\nsocieties or joining existing ones without awaiting the gradual\nemergence of bonds of community and reciprocity; consent is an\nimmediate passport to \u201cperfect membership\u201d in a\ncommonwealth (Locke, Second Treatise, \u00a7 119). Third,\nthough consent is defined by its performative character, ancillary\nnon-performative features naturally accompany it: consent also\nexpresses the acceptability, or at least tolerability, of the\ngovernment. This may mark consented-to rulers as salient from among a\nnumber of possible contenders, and it may signal that they stand a\ngood chance of being effective, which is itself a necessary condition\nfor the justification of any political authority.\n\nIt is open to doubt how persuasive such considerations are. But\nmatters are even worse, for it is in any case clear that many people\nhave done nothing that counts as giving such consent. Even freely\ngiven oaths of office and naturalization do not usually amount to a\ngeneral commitment to obey the law (Greenawalt 1987). Other acts are\neven less plausibly so interpreted. Plato\u2019s Crito\nintroduces the idea that continued residence counts as some kind of\ntacit consent to obey, and Locke extends that to include any enjoyment\nof the benefits of government\u2014\u201cwhether it be barely\ntravelling freely on the highway\u201d (Second Treatise,\n\u00a7 199). Whatever the moral relevance of these facts, they do not\ncount as consent, for people do these things without imagining they\nwill create obligations, and they do them in circumstances in which\nthey have no feasible alternative. Other non-promissory actions, for\nexample voting or participating in politics, fare no better: many do\nnot vote, and few who do regard it as undertaking any duties at all.\nPerhaps we can say that if people consent, and if\nthe relevant legitimacy conditions are fulfilled, then they will have\na duty to obey the law. That is obviously a far cry from establishing\nlaw\u2019s claims, however.\n\nAlternatively, we might amend our theory and justify political\nauthority not by appealing to the fact that we have consented to it,\nbut rather by appealing to the fact that we would, or perhaps should,\nhave consented to it, under some idealized condition\u2014say, if we\nhad been more rational or better informed (Estlund 2008:\n117\u2013135). The problem with this move, however, is that in\ngrounding political authority in hypothetical, rather than\nactual, consent, the view seems to lose much of its appeal.\nThe reason the notion of consent is especially attractive is that it\npromises to reconcile being subject to someone else\u2019s authority\nwith retaining our capacity to act as autonomous agents. Consent does\nthat because insofar as we have consented to someone else having\nauthority over us, any obligations they impose on us, can ultimately\nbe traced back, although indirectly, to an exercise of our will,\nnamely our decision to consent. In this limited sense, the obligations\nin question are obligations that we have willingly incurred. None of\nthis is true in the case of hypothetical consent, however. For our\nwill plays no role in generating any of the obligations that the\npolitical authority imposes on us if the authority is justified not by\nappealing to our actual choice to consent to it, but rather by\nappealing to the hypothetical choice of some idealized version of\nourselves. Indeed, some have argued that hypothetical consent is best\nunderstood as a version of natural duty view in disguise (Simmons\n2005: 117). Ultimately, what justifies political authority here is the\nfact that we have independent reasons to act as the authority\nrequires. For these are the very reasons that explain why we would (or\nshould) consent to an authority that requires those things if we were\nmore rational, or better informed. If so, hypothetical consent is at\nmost a heuristic device which helps us see what those reasons are (Raz\n1986; Sreenivasan 2009; Thomson 1990; but see Enoch 2017).\n4.2 Fairness\n\nEven if we cannot be said to have meaningfully consented to them, it\nseems clear that (reasonably just) political authorities do provide us\nwith crucially important benefits, such as security and the rule of\nlaw. Some have pointed to these benefits to justify our duty to obey\nand support the authorities in question. The core idea here is that\nthose who benefit from a fair scheme of cooperation have a duty to do\ntheir allotted part under that scheme. In other words, if others obey\nthe law to our benefit, we owe them a duty not to take a free-ride on\ntheir compliance (Hart 1955; Rawls 1964).\n\nUpon closer look, however, some of the worries that afflict consent\ntheories crop up here as well. For intuitively it\u2019s only when\nthe benefits produced by a cooperative scheme are accepted by\nits members that the existence of fair-play obligations is\nuncontroversial. If a scheme of cooperation simply thrusts benefits on\npeople as the unavoidable fall-out of the cooperative activity of\nothers\u2014even very valuable benefits\u2014it is doubtful that we\nhave a duty to comply with the scheme. However, it\u2019s unclear in\nwhat sense we can be said to have accepted the benefits provided by\nthe state. After all, the central benefits of an effective legal\nsystem, including security and order, are the sort of non-excludable\npublic goods that Simmons (1979: 138\u2013139) calls \u201copen\nbenefits\u201d. They are provided to all those living in the\nterritory over which the state claims authority, regardless of whether\nthe benefits in question are welcomed or not. Rarely can these\nbenefits be avoided, and when they can, it\u2019s only at great cost.\nMore importantly, states typically claim the same type of authority\nboth over those who accept the benefits and over those who don\u2019t\n(Nozick 1974; Rawls 1964; Simmons 2001: Chapters 1\u20132).\n\nIn reply, some have argued that although it is true that, normally,\nacceptance is required in order to incur fair-play obligations, this\nis not the case when it comes to the sort of \u201cpresumptively\nbeneficial\u201d goods that states provide. Since goods like security\nand order are necessary for any acceptable life, we can presume that\neveryone would pursue these benefits, if doing so were necessary to\nreceive them. Failing to do so would be irrational after all (Klosko\n1991, 2005; see also Arneson 1982; Dagger 1997, 2018). The problem\nwith this argument is that we often make choices that are irrational\nin this sense but\u2014leaving aside cases where paternalistic\ninterference might be justified\u2014this is normally enough to\nshield us from incurring the costs associated with making the\nreasonable choice. Although it might be irrational not to buy a\nparticular life-insurance policy, if I refuse to do so, you\u2019re\nnot allowed to provide me with the policy and expect me to pay for it.\nWhy think that refusing to accept the benefits provided by the state\nshould not protect us in the same way from incurring the costs\nattached to them? After all, these obligations are meant to rule out\nattempts to take advantage of the members of a cooperative scheme by\nexploiting their sacrifices and reaping the benefits produced by the\nscheme without bearing any of the costs associated with their\nproduction. But if I don\u2019t accept the relevant benefits because,\nperhaps foolishly, I fail to appreciate their value, I am not trying\nto take advantage of anyone.\n\nThings are more complicated than we might think at first here because\nit\u2019s not unrealistic that, at least in some cases, the rejection\nof essential open benefits that we know we are going to receive anyway\nmight be the product of motivationally-biased beliefs triggered by a\ndesire to free-ride (i.e., irrational beliefs that we have developed,\nperhaps unconsciously, in order to receive those benefits without\nhaving to contribute our fair share to their production). And\nit\u2019s plausible that when this is what explains our failure to\naccept the benefits in question, our fair-play obligations are not\nundermined (Renzo 2014). But there is no reason to think that this\nexplanation will be valid in every case in which the benefits provided\nby the state are rejected. Realistically, some cases of rejection will\nbe genuine, and in those cases, fairness seems unable to vindicate our\nobligation to obey the law.\n\nA further complication concerns the fact that, despite being\nnon-excludable in the sense that they cannot be selectively provided\nonly to those who ask for them, many of the \u201copen\nbenefits\u201d provided by states are not fairly distributed among\nall citizens. Even in societies that present themselves as liberal and\negalitarian, minorities are often discriminated against and suffer\nserious injustice at the ends of their government. When this is the\ncase, the idea that obedience might required as a way of doing\none\u2019s fair share in maintaining a cooperative scheme for\nreciprocal benefit surely lose much of its force (Shelby 2016; see\nalso Kelly 2022 and Yankah 2022).\n4.3 Gratitude\n\nFairness (in its voluntaristic interpretation) requires some sort of\nacceptance, as opposed to mere receipt, of the benefits produced by\nthe state in order for political obligation to be generated. However,\nsome transactions seem to generate obligations, despite the fact that\nthe benefits received have not been accepted. For example, if you\nprovide me with a benefit, I ought at least to be grateful, and\nexpress my gratitude in a suitable form. Couldn\u2019t this idea be\nused to justify political obligation? Some argue that it can. Obeying\nthe law, according to them, is a way for us to discharge the duty of\ngratitude we owe our own state for the benefits we receive from it\n(Plato [Crito]; W. D Ross 1930; Walker 1988; Klosko\n1989).\n\nOne problem with this account is that the mere receipt of a benefit\ndoesn\u2019t seem enough to warrant a duty of gratitude. Perhaps I\nenjoy listening to your trombone practice, but if you provide this\nbenefit to me unwittingly (perhaps you think that I\u2019m away on\nholiday, while you practice next door) do I owe you a duty of\ngratitude? And do I owe you a duty if your intention is to harm me,\nrather than benefit me? (Perhaps you know I\u2019m next door, and you\npractice loudly in order to bother me, unaware that there\u2019s\nnothing I enjoy more than listening to your trombone.) This seems\nimplausible. The mere provision of a benefit doesn\u2019t seem to\ngenerate duties of gratitude, unless the benefit in question is\nprovided with the right intention. But can states have intentions to\nbegin with (if not in a metaphorical sense)? Those who deny that\nconclude that, for this reason, no duties of gratitude can be owed to\nthem (Simmons 1979: ch. 7; but see Knowles 2002).\n\nThis objection is, in a sense, symmetrical to one considered in\nrelation to fair-play accounts. There we saw that merely receiving the\nservices provided by the state is not enough to ground political\nobligation unless those receiving these benefits have certain mental\nstates (i.e., the intention to accept the benefits). Here the\nobjection is that receiving the same services is not enough to ground\npolitical obligation unless those providing them have certain mental\nstates (i.e., the intention to benefit their recipients). However,\nit\u2019s worth noticing that the former objection applies here as\nwell. As we have seen, the services provided by the state are hard to\navoid and, more importantly, the demands that states make on us are\nthe same whether we welcome those services or not. But the claim that\nwe can incur duties of gratitude for benefits that we don\u2019t\nwelcome, and perhaps explicitly reject, seems controversial. Once\nagain, it might be that it\u2019s irrational to reject the benefits,\nbut if we do (and we are sincere), it\u2019s unclear that any costs\nmay be imposed on us as a way of discharging our duties of\ngratitude.\n5. Non-Transactional Theories\n\nThe appeal of transactional theories is that it seems intuitively\nplausible that political obligation has something to do with the\nduties generated by the important benefits that states provide to\ntheir members. The problem is that the mere provision of benefits\nseems insufficient to generate obligations unless certain\npsychological conditions are fulfilled by those who receive the\nbenefits, and possibly also by those who provide them. But, as we have\nseen, it is doubtful that these conditions will be fulfilled by all\nthose over whom states claim authority.\n\nThis has led some to abandon the idea that political obligation can be\ngrounded in some sort of transaction whereby we offer our allegiance\nto our state in return for the services it provides. Some of the most\ninteresting developments in the contemporary debate consists in\nexploring viable alternatives to this strategy.\n5.1 Instrumental Justification\n\nOne influential line of argument justifies authority instrumentally,\nas a way to help its subjects do what they ought.\n\n\nThe normal and primary way to establish that a person should be\nacknowledged to have authority over another person involves showing\nthat the alleged subject is likely better to comply with reasons which\napply to him (other than the alleged authoritative directives) if he\naccepts the directives of the alleged authority as authoritatively\nbinding, and tries to follow them, than if he tries to follow the\nreasons which apply to him directly. (Raz 1994: 214; see also Raz\n1986: 38\u201369; Raz 2006)\n\n\nRaz calls this the \u201cnormal justification thesis\u201d (NJT). It\nis satisfied only if the authority bases his directives on the reasons\nwhich apply to the subjects (the \u201cdependence thesis\u201d) and\nif the subjects take his directives as \u201cexclusionary\u201d or\n\u201cpre-emptive\u201d reasons (see Section 1 above), displacing\ntheir own judgements about what is to be done on the merits (the\n\u201cpre-emption thesis\u201d). Three points need emphasis. First,\na normal justification is not a unique justification, but one typical\nto a variety of practical and theoretical authorities. At its core\nidea is that justified authorities help their subjects do what they\nalready have good reason to do; it does not apply when it is more\nimportant for the subjects to decide for themselves than to decide\ncorrectly. Second, although NJT has similarities to\nrule-utilitarianism, it is not a utilitarian theory: that requires\nfurther commitments about what sort of reasons are relevant and how\nabout indirect policies may be pursued. Third, NJT does not require\nvalid authority to promote the subject\u2019s self-interest. For\nexample, if there are investments it is immoral to make (e.g., in\ncountries that tolerate slavery) then a consultant\u2019s\nrecommendations merit deference only they steer one away from those\ninvestments: it is not enough (or permissible) for them to maximize\none\u2019s financial returns. NJT is governed by whatever reasons\ncorrectly apply to the case, not reasons of which the agent\nis aware, or which serve his self-interest narrowly understood.\n\nSomething like this does capture the way we justify deferring to\nexpert opinions of scientists or to the advice of doctors who know\nbetter than we do. Were we to try to second-guess them we could not\nprofit from their expertise. To accept them as authoritative therefore\nrequires deferring to their judgement, and allowing that to displace\nour own assessment of what is to be done. This is not blind\ndeference: the subject remains attentive to higher-order\nconsiderations that determine whether the authority is trustworthy,\nacting in good faith, and so on. And the deference may be limited in\nscope and subject to checks of its effectiveness over time.\n\nHow far do such considerations apply to political authority? The idea\nthat political authority is primarily justified by virtue of some\nvaluable service it provides to those that are subject to it certainly\nseems appealing. And the view has a broader application than we might\ninitially think, once we consider the important role that political\nauthority is normally deemed to play in creating or supporting\nvaluable schemes of social cooperation. If we have reasons to support\nsuch schemes and the NJT is correct, we may be justified in obeying\nthe authority, even though the schemes in question are not those we\nwould have chosen ourselves. The NJT is thus considered by many as\nwell placed to justify obedience in general \u201cco-ordination\nproblems\u201d and in situations in which individual reasoning might\nbe self-defeating, for instance, in prisoner dilemmas.\n\nA worry some have raised about NJT is that although able to vindicate\nthe claim that we have reason to act as the authority requires, it\nseems unable to vindicate the claim that we have an obligation to do\nso. As we have seen, authorities are normally thought to have the\nmoral power to impose obligations over us, or at least the right to\ncoerce us to act as they require. Experts, by contrast, lack such\npower. Refusing to comply with their directives, no matter how\nfoolish, doesn\u2019t give them the standing to demand compliance or\nto sanction us if we refuse. One of the main objections raised against\nNJT is that it blurs the distinction between being subject to\nsomeone\u2019s authority and merely receiving advice from an expert\n(Perry 2005; Himma 2007; Darwall 2013: chs. 8\u20139; Tadros 2020;\nbut see Raz 2010). A further objection is that Raz\u2019s view fails\nto pay sufficient attention to the procedural aspects of the\njustification for political authority. We normally think that\nit\u2019s important that the decisions of political authorities are\nthe product of fair-democratic procedures, but a purely instrumental\njustifications seems insensitive to this sort of consideration\n(Waldron 1999; Shapiro 2002; Hershovitz 2003; Christiano 2004; Viehoff\n2011).\n\nAs for its capacity to deal with coordination problems, it is\nuncertain how far deference to authority is really needed here. The\nextent to which people need authoritative guidance to secure\ncooperation varies with context, and law can solve some problems of\ncooperation simply by providing information or by restructuring\nincentives (see Green 1988: 89\u2013157). That suggests that NJT\ncovers only a narrow range of legitimate state activity. But in\nanother way, NJT seems too broad. We do not think that political\nauthority should be acknowledged whenever the rulers can\nbetter ensure conformity to right reason. There are matters that are\ntoo trivial or otherwise inappropriate for political regulation. So\nperhaps some sort of threshold condition must first be met, and NJT\nshould be confined to issues of general social importance.\n(Raz\u2019s view has had a pervasive influence in the debate,\ngenerating a vast literature. Recent works that engage with it include\nShapiro 2002; Perry 2012; Enoch 2014; Macklem 2015.)\n5.2 Necessity and Natural Duty\n\nArguments based on necessity may be motivated by just that worry. On\nthis account, it is not enough that someone be able to help others\ntrack right reason, he must be able to do so within a certain domain.\nLocke thought the most urgent question for political philosophy was to\n\u201cdistinguish exactly the business of civil government\u201d\n(Locke 1689 [1983: 26]), to determine what things are properly\nCaesar\u2019s. Some contemporary writers take a related view.\nElizabeth Anscombe argues that the domain of authority is the domain\nof necessary social functions.\n\n\nIf something is necessary, if it is, for example, a necessary task in\nhuman life, then a right arises in those whose task it is, to have\nwhat belongs to the performance of the task. (Anscombe 1978: 17)\n\n\nBut what tasks are necessary? Some, as we have seen, point to the\nproduction of \u201cpresumptively beneficial public goods\u201d,\ngoods that anyone would want and which require social co-operation to\nproduce (Klosko 1991). Other views are more expansive. Finnis, for\nexample, believes that law must provide a comprehensive framework for\nrealizing a list of supposedly self-evident values including life,\nknowledge, play and religion (Finnis 1979: 81\u201397,\n154\u2013156). In between, we find a range of nuanced intermediate\npositions (see, for example, Copp 1999 and Perry 2012). An influential\nintermediate position ties political authority to the realm of justice\nand grounds obedience in a natural duty. According to John Rawls,\n\n\n[t]his duty requires us to support and comply with just institutions\nthat exist and apply to us. It also constrains us to further just\narrangements not yet established, at least when this can be done\nwithout too much cost to ourselves. (Rawls 1971: 115)\n\n\nThe basis of Rawls\u2019s theory in necessity becomes evident if we\nexplore what it might be for a just institution to \u201capply to\nus\u201d. An Institute for the Advancement of Philosophers\ncannot benefit us, however justly, and then demand that we pay its\ndues (Simmons 1979: 148). If so, it looks as if we need to accept the\nbenefits provided by a given institution before the institution in\nquestion can be said to \u201capply to us\u201d. But that is to\ntransform a natural duty account into a weakly voluntarist one like\nfairness (see above,\n \u00a74.2).\n One way to diagnose the force of such counterexamples is to notice\nthat, although operating justly, the Institute is\nnot something whose activities are required by justice: they\nare optional, not necessary (Waldron 1993).\n\nThis line of argument is one of the most popular in the contemporary\ndebate. Some have developed Rawls\u2019 somewhat vague idea of a duty\nto \u201csupport and comply with just institutions that exist and\napply to us\u201d by drawing on Kant\u2019s political philosophy,\nwhose central idea is that political authority is necessary to give\nconcrete content and shape to moral rights that are otherwise\nindeterminate in the state of nature (Christiano 2008; Ripstein 2009;\nStilz 2009). Others have drawn instead on Locke\u2019s political\nphilosophy, whose central idea is that even if fully determined rights\ndo exist in the state of nature, they cannot be adequately protected\nwithout authoritative mechanisms designed to adjudicate and punish\ntheir violations (Buchanan 2002; Wellman 2005). On either of these\nviews, we have a natural duty to leave the state of nature and enter\ncivil society in order to be able to live next to each other on\npeaceful terms, respecting each other\u2019s rights.\n\nThis duty is often conceived as a positive duty, for example as a duty\nto do our part in saving others from the dangers of the state of\nnature by supporting just institutions (Wellman 2005). But this view\nseems problematic if we accept that the dangers of the state of nature\nare primarily the product of a range of coordination problems which\nare generated by the fact that we live next to each other without\nbeing subject to the same political authority. These are not dangers\nthat we can save others from by subjecting ourselves to the political\nauthority; these are dangers that we expose others to if we live next\nto them without being subject to the political authority (Renzo 2008).\nIf so, the duty to support just institutions is best understood as\ngrounded in a negative duty not to threaten others, rather than in a\npositive one. Political authority is necessary to neutralize the\nthreat we pose to each other when we live in physical proximity while\nlacking mechanisms to set and enforce shared norms (Kant 1797; Renzo\n2011; but see Steinhoff 2016).\n\nThe main challenge for Natural Duty views is, once again, that\nit\u2019s unclear how we should make sense of the idea that certain\ninstitutions \u201capply to us\u201d. For even if we rule out just\ninstitutions whose activities are not required by justice (like\nSimmons\u2019 Institute for the Advancement of\nPhilosophers), we are still left with a large number of\ncandidates that, in principle, seem to have authority over us. At\nleast when we think about the political authority of states, we\nnormally think that the scope of the authority is limited to the\nindividuals living on the territory of each state (or individuals\nrelated in special ways to those living in their territory). And we\nnormally think that those individuals owe political obligations to\ntheir state in particular, obligations that they do not owe to other\nstates, regardless of how just they are. But how can we vindicate this\nidea, if what grounds political authority is our duty to support just\ninstitutions? Why couldn\u2019t we discharge this duty by obeying and\nsupporting some state other than the one which claims authority over\nthe territory where we live? (See Waldron 1993 for an influential\nanswer to this question; and Simmons 2005 for further criticism.)\n\nAnother challenge concerns a second component of Anscombe\u2019s\nclaim that\n\n\n[i]f something is necessary, if it is, for example, a necessary task\nin human life, then a right arises in those whose task it is, to have\nwhat belongs to the performance of the task.\n\n\nSuppose we have adequately answered the question of which tasks states\nought to be perform in order to perform their socially necessary\nfunctions. We then need to identify which rights they needed in order\nto be able to perform such tasks? Anscombe refers to the right to have\nwhat is necessary for the role, but what is that? Hume thought it\nobvious that political society could not exist without \u201cexact\nobedience of the magistrate\u201d but this is surely empiricism\nwithout the facts. Legal systems do tolerate a certain amount of\ndisobedience without this hampering their capacity to function (Green\n1988: 228\u2013230).\n5.3 Constitutive Obligations\n\nA third type of non-transactional view challenges the very idea that a\njustification for political obligation is needed. For example, Thomas\nMcPherson writes\n\n\n[W]hy should I obey the government is an absurd question. We have not\nunderstood what it means to be a member of political society\nif we suppose that political obligation is something we might not have\nhad and that therefore needs to be justified. (McPherson\n1967: 64)\n\n\nOn this view, the many attempts to find independent moral principles\nto justify obligation are not merely mistaken, they are conceptually\nconfused; they exhibit a \u201csymptom of philosophical\ndisorder\u201d (Pitkin 1965 [1972: 75]). The question of political\nobligation should be addressed instead by attending to the meaning of\n\u201cmember\u201d.\n\nIt is hard to find philosophers who still think that normative\nquestions can be resolved by linguistic considerations, but a more\nsophisticated version of this strategy has been recently advanced by\nMargaret Gilbert (2006), relying on the idea that members of political\ncommunities are jointly committed to uphold its institutions, and\nthereby obligated to play their part in executing this joint\ncommitment. (Notice, however, that for Gilbert, these obligations are\nnot moral in nature and thus her view is, in this important respect,\nvery different from all the other views we are considering.)\n\nA more influential version of the constitutive argument appeals to the\nvalue of associative obligations. Here the starting point is the\nobservation that we often find ourselves involved in relationships and\npractices that come with special responsibilities attached to them.\nEven when we have not chosen to be part of them, it\u2019s our very\nmembership in them that brings with it distinctive \u201crole\nobligations\u201d (Hardimon 1994). Failing to realize this fact is\nfailing to correctly interpret the responsibilities and practices in\nquestion (Dworkin 1986: 198). It\u2019s in this sense that Ronald\nDworkin claims that\n\n\n[p]olitical association, like family or friendship and other forms of\nassociation more local and intimate, is itself pregnant of obligation.\n(Dworkin 1986: 206)\n\n\nWe can make sense of these valuable practices and relationships only\nif we correctly understand the role that the obligations associated\nwith them are meant to play. Indeed, some go further and argue that\ngiven that these roles are typically crucial components of our own\nidentity, correctly understanding the obligations in question is\nnecessary to avoid being alienated from ourselves (Horton 2010; Tamir\n1995). The social preconditions of our identity are partly constituted\nby these obligations, so making sense of them is required to\nultimately make sense of who we are. By making sense of these\nobligations, we ultimately make sense of ourselves.\n\nSome have resisted this move by pointing out that while people in\norganic associations do often feel obligations to other members, we\nnormally seek an independent ground to justify them (see Simmons 1996;\nWellman 1997). After all, it\u2019s hardly surprising that members\nwho have been socialized within a certain practice will feel that\ntheir identity is shaped in important ways by the responsibilities\nassociated with it. The worry is that, absent a justification for this\ntreatment, these feelings are merely an instance of false\nconsciousness. It\u2019s worth noticing, however, that whilst this\nmight be an objection for communitarian versions of the theory (Horton\n2010), it is not an objection against Dworkin\u2019s formulation of\nthe associative view. Dworkin does believe that we have\n\n\na duty to honour our responsibilities under social practices that\ndefine groups and attach special responsibilities to membership.\n(Dworkin 1986: 198)\n\n\nprovided the group\u2019s members think that their obligations are\nspecial, personal, and derive from a good faith interpretation of\nequal concern for the well-being of all its members. But for him these\nconditions are not a matter of the members\u2019 actual feelings and\nthoughts. Rather, they are interpretive properties that we would do\nwell to impute to the members. Even so, why think that they ground a\nduty of obedience, as opposed to a duty of respectful attention, or a\nduty to apologize for cases of non-compliance? Certainly obedience is\nnot part of Dworkin\u2019s paradigm virtue of\n\u201cfraternity\u201d\u2014mutual aid and support are the normal\nobligations there. Indeed, the classical associative model for\npolitical authority was not fraternity, but paternity,\nagainst which Locke argued so decisively. This is not to deny that we\nowe something to those decent associations of which we find ourselves\nnon-voluntary members\u2014but this doesn\u2019t seem enough to\nvindicate political obligation (on Dworkin\u2019s view, see Perry\n2008).\n\nA second objection to the associative model consists in pointing out\nthat even if we concede that the model can justify obligations that\nare owed to members of small groups, which are structured around close\npersonal interactions, this is not yet to say that it can do the same\nwith obligations that are owed members of large groups, such as our\npolitical communities, most of whom we never have a chance to meet or\ninteract with (Simmons 2001: Chapter 4; but see Horton 2010 and\nGilbert 2006). It\u2019s unclear, however, how forceful this\nobligation is. Suppose that I\u2019ve been unable to interact with my\nparents or my siblings for most\u2014or even all\u2014of my life,\nfor reasons that none of us could control. Does that mean that my\nspecial obligations to them are automatically cancelled? Perhaps,\nunder certain circumstances, but not necessarily.\n\nA more promising objection targets the idea that associative\nobligations are non-voluntary. This is certainly true if by\n\u201cnon-voluntary\u201d we mean that we don\u2019t necessarily\nchoose to enter the relationships and the practices that are meant to\ngenerate the obligations. While it might be unclear whether we can\nchoose to become friend with someone (as opposed to our friendship\nforming spontaneously), we normally don\u2019t choose to enter our\nfamily. Still, it is possible for parents to disown their children and\nfor children to deny their parents, under certain conditions. When the\nattitudes of reciprocal trust and affection that are meant to support\nthese relationships disappear, the accompanying obligations are\nsignificantly weakened, and possibly extinguished. This has led some\nto argue that associative responsibilities are best understood as\n\u201cquasi-voluntarist\u201d. Although they are not premised on a\nchoice to enter the relationship with which they are associated, they\nare conditional on the relationship being endorsed, if only in the\nminimal sense that we could have stepped out of it, had we wished to\n(Renzo 2012; but see Dagger 2018: 79\u201382). But once we go down\nthis road, we are faced, once again, with the worry afflicting\nvoluntaristic accounts, such as those that appeal to consent or\nfairness. If endorsing our membership in the political community is a\ncondition for having the role obligations associated with such\nmembership, then anyone who fails to do so lacks political\nobligation.\n6. Scepticism and Anarchism\n\nAs the above survey suggests, there are plausible objections to each\nof the dominant justifications for the duty to obey the law. (For\nhelpful assessments of other theories, see also Wasserstrom 1963;\nSmith 1973; Simmons 1979; Huemer 2013.) Each leaves significant gaps\nin the authority of law. This is not an impossibility proof\u2014only\nanarchists like Wolff think that justified political authority is\nimpossible. But neither is it just the familiar problem that\nphilosophical theories provide only a rough fit to our casuistic\njudgements. The problem is that the typical justifications for\nauthority are all sensitive to context in a way that the claims of law\nare not. To put it another way, law itself purports to determine how\nfar and in what contexts its authority binds. (For a formulation of\nthe sceptical view that explores its relationship with legal\npositivism, see Kramer 1999.)\n\nThe resulting scepticism about the obligation to obey has given rise\nto a debate about its significance (Senor 1987; Gans 1992: 90). As in\nother areas of philosophy, some treat sceptical conclusions as a\nreductio against whatever premises seem to support them;\nothers are inclined to follow the arguments where they lead. In\nassessing the significance of scepticism, one needs to bear in mind\nseveral points.\n\nTo begin with, scepticism about political obligation flows from the\nspecial features of legal authority, in particular, its wide\nscope, its institutionalized character, and its moral fallibility.\nThat is why the familiar principles by which we justify the authority\nof teachers, parents, doctors, or executors do not readily generalize\nto cover all laws. Most sceptical arguments are about over-reach. They\ndo not deny that legal authority is often valuable, or that there is\noften content-dependent reason to do what law requires; they do not\ndeny that some people have moral obligations to obey; they do not even\ndeny that there are some laws that everyone has a moral\nobligation to obey. They deny only that the conscientious subject is\nbound to take the law at its word, that he must share the self-image\nof the state.\n\nThis does not amount to endorsing a policy of \u201cpick and\nchoose\u201d. It is consistent with a mixed policy: there may be\nareas and issues with respect to which one should accept an obligation\nof obedience and others where one should apportion one\u2019s\ncompliance to the merits. Hart writes:\n\n\nThe recognition of an obligation to obey the law must as a\nminimum imply that there is at least some area of conduct regulated by\nlaw in which we are not free to judge the moral merits of particular\nlaws and to make our obedience conditional on this judgment. (Hart\n1958: 104)\n\n\nSceptical arguments need not deny that there is some such area; they\ndeny that it coincides with law\u2019s actual claims.\n\nSecondly, scepticism about obligation does not entail scepticism about\nlegitimacy: one may affirm that law is entitled to coerce while\ndenying that all of law\u2019s subjects have a duty to obey it (see\nGreen 1988; Simmons 1979; Edmundson 1998). Scepticism about the\npossibility of legitimate government leads to anarchism of the\nordinary sort; scepticism about political obligation leads only to\nwhat is called \u201cphilosophical anarchism\u201d: the denial that\nlaw has all the authority it claims for itself.\n\nThirdly, scepticism is not the view that assuming an obligation to\nobey would be impermissible, as suggested by anarchists like\nWilliam Godwin or R. P. Wolff and extreme individualists like Thoreau.\nRather, sceptics argue that there are also other morally\npermissible attitudes to have towards the law. These attitudes may be\nmore prevalent, and more justifiable, than some philosophers\nsuppose.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noticing that, if successful, the objections\nconsidered above only show that there is no principle capable of\ngrounding political obligation over all those over whom states claim\nauthority. But why think that a sound theory of political obligation\nshould appeal to a single principle? Perhaps our best account of\npolitical obligation will employ different principles to justify the\nstate\u2019s right to demand our obedience in different areas (Klosko\n2005) and over different individuals (Renzo 2012 and 2014). One way of\novercoming skepticism about political obligation is to be pluralist\nabout it (J. Wolff 2000; Knowles 2010; Mokrosinska; 2012)\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, N.
