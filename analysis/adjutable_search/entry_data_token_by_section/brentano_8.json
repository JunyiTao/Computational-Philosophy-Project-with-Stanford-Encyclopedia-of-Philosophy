    "main_text": "The Impact of Brentano\u2019s Philosophy || Early Reception: The Brentano School\n7.1 Early Reception: The Brentano School\n\nBrentano\u2019s contributions to philosophy were widely discussed\namong philosophers and psychologists at the end of the nineteenth and\nthe beginning of the twentieth century. Moreover, he had a strong\nimpact on an impressive number of students who became famous\nphilosophers on their own right. Often, these philosophers are\nreferred to as the \u201cSchool of Franz Brentano,\u201d (cf.\nAlbertazzi e.al. 1996) in order to underline that all of them drew\nexplicitly (and when not explicitly, then recognizably) on\nBrentano\u2019s work. All members of the school have become\nacquainted with Brentano\u2019s philosophy in his lectures or through\nconversation or correspondence with him, but they form a quite\nheterogeneous group that did not make attempts to jointly develop a\nshared position: there was no general acceptance of a specific\nunifying doctrine of the \u201cSchool\u201d, nor did its members\nmake attempts to unite forces and cooperate on specific projects. What\nunites the School is a vivid interests in the topics that Brentano\ndiscussed in his lectures, first and foremost in psychology and in the\nidea that philosophy should adopt a rigorous, scientific method (cf.\nDewalque 2017a, b). In fact, it was Brentano\u2019s methodological\nmaxim that has raised the interest in most members of the school in\nthe first place, cf., for example, Stumpf (1919) and Husserl (1919),\nboth of who suggest that Brentano\u2019s conception of philosophy as\na rigorous science had a decisive impact on their decision to pursue a\nprofessional career in philosophy.\n\nBrentano\u2019s influence on students has seen different phases that\nare loosely connected to the places where he taught. In his early\nyears in W\u00fcrzburg (1866\u20131873), Brentano became noted mainly\nfor his attempt to renew philosophy on the basis of a rigorous,\nscientific method. His most important students at the time,\n Carl Stumpf\n and\n Anton Marty,\n made a significant academic career in their own right. As Brentano\nwas not yet appointed professor and could, in consequence, not yet\nsupervise PhD theses, both completed their PhD with Lotze in\nG\u00f6ttingen. Stumpf then held positions in Prague, Halle, Munich,\nand Berlin, where he founded a psychological laboratory and gave\ndecisive impulses for the development of Gestalt psychology. Anton\nMarty became professor at the University of Prague and had a strong\ninfluence with his work on the philosophy of language. Both Stumpf and\nMarty developed their own positions and deviated locally from\nBrentano\u2019s views, but they remained faithful followers who\ncontinued to acknowledge the influence that Brentano has had on\nthem.\n\nWhen Brentano took up teaching at the University of Vienna in 1874,\nhis lectures soon became very popular among students. In the first\nyears, Thomas Masaryk (who later became the first president of the\nCzechoslovakia),\n Alexius Meinong,\n Alois H\u00f6fler, and\n Christian von Ehrenfels\n attended Brentano\u2019s lectures. In the years after 1880 (when\nBrentano had lost his chair and was teaching as Privatdozent,\nwhich meant that he could no longer supervise PhD theses) Franz\nHillebrand,\n Edmund Husserl,\n and\n Kazimierz Twardowski\n studied with him. Unlike Stumpf or Marty, Brentano\u2019s students\nin Vienna encountered a mature professor who had his opus\nmaximum already published. Their relation to Brentano, in\nconsequence, was less that of a friendship, and more that between a\nstudent and a renowned professor. Soon many of them have felt the urge\nto overcome Brentano\u2019s influence and define their own,\nindependent philosophical position \u2013 and possibly form a school\nin their own right. In particular Meinong and Husserl, who are\nprobably the most famous representants of Brentano\u2019s school,\ncame to have a rather troublesome relation to their former teacher. It\nis not by accident that both used the term \u201cBrentano\nSchool\u201d only to distance themselves from it.\n\nIn 1895, when Brentano gave up his position as Privatdozent\nin Vienna and moved to Florence, he gave up teaching and could no\nlonger exert a direct influence on students. In this period, the\ncenter of the Brentano school moved to Prague, where Anton Marty held\nregular meetings with interested students, among them Oskar Kraus and\nAlfred Kastil. These second-generation members of the Brentano school\n\u2013 who are often called \u201cBrentanoten\u201d or\n\u201corthodox Brentanists\u201d \u2013 stayed very faithful to\nBrentano\u2019s philosophy, (in particular to his last, reistic phase\nthat they knew first-hand). They saw it as their main task to preserve\nBrentano\u2019s view and to defend them against the developments\nintroduced by Husserl and the early phenomenologists as well as those\nintroduced by Meinong and other members of the Graz School,\nrespectively. After Brentano\u2019s death in 1917, they tried to set\nup and archive for Brentano\u2019s Nachlass and publish\ntexts from it posthumously. While in the first years they achieved\nconsiderable results, not at least due to the help of the Czech\npresident Jan Masaryk, the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938\nforced them into emigration and so brought an end to the Brentano\nSchool.\n",
