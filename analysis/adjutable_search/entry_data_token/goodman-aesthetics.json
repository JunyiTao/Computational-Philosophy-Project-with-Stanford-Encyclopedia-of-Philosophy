Biographical Sketch\n\nGoodman\u2019s personal life (August 7, 1906\u2013November 25, 1998)\nwas linked to art in many and important ways. From 1929 to 1941, he\ndirected an art gallery in Boston: the Walker-Goodman Art Gallery. It\nis through this commitment that he met his wife, Katharine Sturgis, a\nskilled painter whose work is reproduced in Goodman\u2019s Ways\nof Worldmaking (1978a). In 1941, he received a Ph.D. in\nPhilosophy at Harvard University, with a dissertation, A Study of\nQualities (1941), that laid out the nominalist view that would\nlater be presented in his first book, The Structure of\nAppearance (1951). He taught at Tufts University (1945\u201346),\nThe University of Pennsylvania (1946\u201364), Brandeis University\n(1964\u201367), and, from 1967, at Harvard University, where he\nbecame Emeritus Professor in 1977.\n\nThroughout his life, he remained a passionate collector of ancient and\ncontemporary art pieces, as well as a generous lender and donor to a\nnumber of museums. He was a rigorous philosopher who, however, never\nlacked the capacity to talk to artists and researchers in other\nfields. In 1967, at the School of Education of Harvard, he established\nan interdisciplinary program for the study of education and the arts,\n\u201cProject Zero,\u201d which he directed until 1971. Still at\nHarvard, he founded and directed the Summer Dance program. It is,\nthen, not at all surprising that, amongst Goodman\u2019s works, we\nfind, next to philosophical production, multimedia projects that\ncombine\u2014indeed very much in Goodmanian fashion\u2014painting\n(including Sturgis\u2019s work), music, and dance: Hockey\nSeen (1972), Rabbit Run (1973), and Variations\n(1985d).\n2. Classifying and Constructing Worlds\n\nOne way of approaching Goodman\u2019s aesthetics, and of seeing both\nits unity and continuity with his work in other areas of philosophy,\nis by recalling some of the ideas presented in one of his early works,\nFact, Fiction, and Forecast (originally published in 1954\n[Goodman 1983]). There Goodman formulates what he calls \u201cthe\ngeneral problem of projection\u201d (of which the famous \u201cnew\nriddle of induction\u201d is an instance). The problem is grounded in\nthe general idea that we project predicates onto reality (a reality\nthat is itself \u201cconstructed\u201d by those projections,\naccording to the constructivist approach Goodman defended from the\ntime of A Study of Qualities [1941], hence in The\nStructure of Appearance [1951] and, later, in Ways of\nWorldmaking [1978a]). Hume famously claimed that inductions are\nbased on regularities found in experience, and concluded that the\ninductive predictions may very well turn out being false. In Fact,\nFiction, and Forecast, Goodman points out how\n\u201cregularities\u201d are themselves in a sense problematic. Take\nsuch objects as emeralds, which we classify by using the predicate\n\u201cgreen.\u201d They can also be said to be \u201cgrue,\u201d\ni.e., observed up to a certain time t and found green, blue\notherwise. Hence, our observations seem to equally grant two different\ninductions\u2014that emeralds will remain green after t or\nthat they will be blue. The problem is a general one, involving not\njust hypotheses but the projection of any predicate onto the world.\nIndeed, as we divide the world into green and blue\nthings, so could we divide it into grue and bleen\nthings (things that are observed up to t and found blue, and\ngreen otherwise). Notice that, under a description of the world using\nthe \u201cgreen/blue\u201d predicate pair, there may be no change at\ntime t (no change in the color of emeralds and sapphires for\nexample), whereas there would be change under the alternative\n\u201cgrue/bleen\u201d pair. Likewise, whereas there may be change,\nat time t, under \u201cgreen/blue\u201d (in case that, say,\nan emerald is painted over at t), there may be no change\nunder the alternative pair, \u201cgrue/bleen.\u201d The new riddle\nof induction\u2014and, in general, the problem of\nprojection\u2014is, then, to explain what are the bases for\nprojecting certain predicates\u2014\u201cgreen,\u201d\n\u201cblue,\u201d \u201cred,\u201d etc.\u2014onto the world, and\nnot others\u2014\u201cgrue,\u201d \u201cbleen,\u201d\n\u201cgred,\u201d etc. For, as Goodman states it,\n\u201c[r]egularities are where you find them, and you can find them\nanywhere\u201d (1983, 83). There is no difference in principle\nbetween the predicates we use and those we could use, but rather a\npragmatic difference in habit, or of\n\u201centrenchment\u201d of certain predicates and not others.\n\nWhen one combines the idea of predicate entrenchment to that for which\nour successfully projecting certain predicates (and more generally\nsymbols) rather than others modifies our observation and very\nperception of reality (indeed it amounts to constructing\ndifferent realities), one has the basis for Goodman\u2019s general\napproach to our cognitive relationship to the world, of which art is a\nfundamental component. Artworks, too, are symbols, referring to the\nworld (or the worlds they contribute to construct) in a\nvariety of different ways. Understanding the worlds of art is no\ndifferent, in kind, from understanding the worlds of science or of\nordinary perception: it requires interpretation of the\nvarious symbols involved in those areas. Which symbols are\nsuccessfully projected over time\u2014and, for instance, which\nartistic styles are perceived as familiar and which ones as\nrevolutionary, or which linguistic formulas are categorized as literal\nand which ones as metaphorical\u2014largely depends on what is\ncustomary, \u201centrenched,\u201d within a certain cultural,\nartistic, or linguistic community.\n3. The Theory of Symbol Systems in Languages of Art\n\nMost of Goodman\u2019s aesthetics is contained in his Languages\nof Art (which he republished, with slight variations, in a second\nedition in 1976), although what is there presented is clarified,\nexpanded, and sometimes corrected in later essays. As its subtitle,\nAn Approach to a General Theory of Symbols, indicates, this\nis a book with bearings not only on art issues, but on a general\nunderstanding of symbols, linguistic and non-linguistic, in the\nsciences as well as in ordinary life. Indeed, Languages of\nArt has, amongst its merits, that of having broken, in a\nnon-superficial and fruitful way, the divide between art and science.\nGoodman\u2019s general view is that we use symbols in our perceiving,\nunderstanding, and constructing the worlds of our experience: the\ndifferent sciences and the different arts equally contribute to the\nenterprise of understanding the world. As in his works in\nepistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of language, Goodman\u2019s\napproach is often unorthodox and groundbreaking, and yet never in ways\nthat fail to be refreshing and suggestive of future developments (some\nof those developments were pursued by Goodman himself in later essays\nand, most notably, in his last book, co-authored with Catherine Elgin,\nReconceptions in Philosophy and Other Arts and Sciences\n[1988]).\n\nWith respect to art in particular and to symbolic activities in\ngeneral, Goodman advocates a form of cognitivism: by using\nsymbols we discover (indeed we build) the worlds we live in, and the\ninterest we have in symbols\u2014artworks amongst them\u2014is\ndistinctively cognitive. Indeed, to Goodman, aesthetics is but a\nbranch of epistemology. Paintings, sculptures, musical sonatas, dance\npieces, etc. are all made of symbols, which possess different\nfunctions and bear different relations with the worlds they refer to.\nHence, artworks require interpretation, and interpreting them amounts\nto understanding what they refer to, in which way, and within which\nsystems of rules.\n\nSymbolizing is for Goodman the same as referring. Hence, it is\nimportant here to emphasize, first, that reference has, in his view,\ndifferent modes, and, second, that something is a symbol, and\nis a symbol of a given kind, only within a symbol system of\nthat kind, a system governed by the syntactical and semantic rules\nthat are distinctive of symbols of that kind. Of course, natural\nlanguages are examples of symbol systems, but there are many other,\nnon-linguistic systems: pictorial, gestural, diagrammatic, etc.\n3.1 Modes of Reference\n\nThe fundamental notion which is at the core of Goodman\u2019s theory\nof symbols is that of reference\u2014the primitive relation\nof \u201cstanding for\u201d\u2014seen as articulated in different\nmodes, of which denotation is one, and as obtaining not just directly\nbut indirectly as well, sometimes across long chains of reference.\nIndeed, one of the great contributions of Goodman to philosophy is his\ninvestigation of kinds of reference or symbolization. Denotation and\nexemplification are the two fundamental forms of reference out of\nwhich Goodman develops most of his analysis. Denotation is\nthe relationship between a \u201clabel,\u201d such as \u201cJohn F.\nKennedy,\u201d or \u201cThe 34th President of the United\nStates,\u201d and what it labels (Goodman 1976, Chap. 1). In fact,\naccording to Goodman\u2019s nominalist approach, possessing\na feature (or what ordinarily would also be called a property, such as\nbeing blue) just amounts to being denoted by a certain\npredicate or, more precisely, by a \u201clabel\u201d (such as\n\u201cblue\u201d). Hence possession is the converse of\ndenotation. (Of course, labels can be particular or general, as\nreference can be to an individual, as in the \u201cJFK\u201d example\nabove, or, severally, to all the members of a set, as with\n\u201cblue\u201d with respect to all blue items.) Furthermore,\nlabels are not limited to linguistic ones, i.e., to predicates:\npictures, musical symbols, and all other labels classify world items;\nand what something is depends as much on the nonverbal labels applying\nto it as on the predicates it falls under.\n\nExemplification\u2014the sort of reference typical, for\ninstance, of tailors\u2019 swatches\u2014requires possession. In\naddition to possession, however, which of course by itself is not a\nform of symbolization, exemplification requires that the exemplifying\nsymbol refers back to the label or predicate that denotes it.\nHence, exemplification is \u201cpossession plus reference\u201d\n(Goodman 1976, 53). When a feature is referred to in this way, it is\n\u201cexhibited, typified, shown forth\u201d (Goodman 1976, 86).\nWhile any blue object is denoted by the label \u201cblue,\u201d only\nthose things\u2014e.g., blue color swatches\u2014that also refer to\n\u201cblue\u201d and analogous labels exemplify such color, are\n\u201csamples\u201d of it. An important characteristic of samples is\nthat they are selective in the way they function symbolically (see\nalso Goodman 1978a, 63\u201370). A tailor\u2019s swatch does not\nexemplify all of the features it possesses\u2014or all the predicates\nthat denote it\u2014but rather only those for which it is a symbol\n(hence, e.g., predicates denoting color and texture, and not\npredicates denoting size or shape). Which of its properties does a\nsample exemplify depends on the system within which the sample is\nbeing used: color and texture are relevant to the systems used in\ntailoring, not size and shape. Exemplification is for Goodman a common\nand yet, philosophically, unrecognized form of reference. Indeed,\nthroughout his own philosophical oeuvre, we find Goodman using\nexemplification to explain a number of issues: most notably,\nexpression in art, but also, for instance, the notion of artistic\nstyle (1975), how works of architecture can be attributed meaning\n(1985), or the notion of a \u201cvariation upon a theme\u201d in\nsuch arts as music and painting (Goodman, Elgin 1988, Chap. 4).\n\nYet the paths or \u201croutes\u201d of reference can be of many\ndifferent sorts, and indeed symbols may combine in \u201cchains of\nreference\u201d to give rise to instances of complex\nreference (Goodman 1981a). There is, first of all, the sort of\nsymbolization employed by metaphors (as when human beings are\nreferred to as \u201cwolves\u201d), a mode of reference that becomes\ncrucial to Goodman\u2019s analysis of expression in art. In analyzing\nmetaphor, Goodman (1976, Chap. 2; 1979) follows suggestions included\nin Max Black\u2019s famous article on the topic (Black 1954) but\nexpands and adapts them to his own view that denotational\nsymbols\u2014labels\u2014don\u2019t work alone but rather as\nmembers of \u201cschemata\u201d (\u201ca label functions not in\nisolation but as belonging to a family\u201d [Goodman 1976, 71]),\nnormally correlated to some referential \u201crealm.\u201d\n\u201cBlue,\u201d \u201cgreen,\u201d \u201cred,\u201d etc., for\ninstance, typically belong to the same \u201cschema\u201d\u2014a\nset of labels established by context and habit\u2014and the realm of\nreference of such a schema is made of all the ranges of things that\neach label in the schema denotes (all blue objects, all green objects,\netc.). We have an instance of metaphorical reference when a symbol,\nlinguistic or not, is made to refer to something not\nbelonging to the realm normally correlated to the symbol\u2019s\nschema, i.e., not belonging to the sorts of things that the symbols in\nthe schema normally refer to. Hence, calling a painting\n\u201csad\u201d is metaphorical because a predicate that is normally\nprojected upon bearers of mental, emotional states is projected upon\nan inanimate object made of canvas and wood and paint. Using the\nnotions of schema and realm allows Goodman\u2019s analysis to include\nthe claim that typically metaphors bring about rearrangements in a\nfield of reference, which affect several labels at once. It is\nimportant to emphasize that, for Goodman, metaphorical usage is no\nless real or connected to knowledge than literal usage, and\nmetaphorical truth no less a form of truth than literal truth. Indeed,\nthe literal and the metaphorical in a sense lie on the same continuum.\nWhether the application of a label (and the corresponding possession\nof a feature) should be considered literal or metaphorical is just a\nmatter of habit\u2014specifically, a matter of the age of the\nmetaphor, for old metaphors lose their metaphorical status and\nbecome just literal applications. Using a metaphor himself, Goodman\nclaims that \u201ca metaphor is an affair between a predicate with a\npast and an object that yields while protesting\u201d (1976, 69).\nNotice that such a formula includes two elements: that there is\nresistance to a metaphor (deriving from its literal\nfalseness) but also attraction (deriving from the insightful\nreorganization of a schema of labels vis-\u00e0-vis a referential\nrealm, which the metaphor may bring about). A metaphor is a voluntary\nmisassignment of a label, but it is also more than that:\n\u201cWhereas falsity depends upon misassignment of a label,\nmetaphorical truth depends upon reassignment\u201d (1976, 70\nemphasis added).\n\nOther rhetorical figures (although not all of them) can, in\nGoodman\u2019s view be explained in terms of metaphorical\n\u201ctransfers\u201d of this kind, indeed as \u201cmodes of\nmetaphor\u201d: personification, synecdoche, antonomasia, hyperbole,\nlitotes, irony\u2026 (1976, 81\u201385).\n\nOf course, the same item may perform several referential functions at\nthe same time, denoting certain things while exemplifying certain\nfeatures, and do so literally or metaphorically. Furthermore,\nsometimes reference is indirect or mediate (Goodman,\nElgin 1988, 42), brought about by the combination of different forms\nof reference into instances of complex reference. Reference\nmay, so to speak, travel along \u201cchains of\nreference\u201d made of symbols that refer to, or are referred by,\nother symbols. An obvious case is that in which a country like the\nUnited States is referred to by a picture of a bald eagle, thanks to\nthe picture of the bald eagle being a label for a bird that in turn\nexemplifies a label like \u201cbold and free,\u201d which in turn\ndenotes the United States and indeed is, furthermore, exemplified by\nit (Goodman 1984, 62).\n3.2 Symbol Schemes and Symbol Systems\n\nIn general, how a symbol refers\u2014whether it denotes or\nexemplifies, what it denotes or which of its features it exemplifies,\nwhether it does so directly or indirectly, literally or\nmetaphorically\u2014depends on the system of symbolization\nwithin which the symbol is found. Furthermore, a symbol is the sort of\nsymbol it is\u2014linguistic, musical, pictorial, diagrammatic,\netc.\u2014in virtue of its belonging to a symbol system of a certain\nkind. And symbols differ from each other according to their different\nsyntactic and semantic rules.\n\nIndeed, a symbol system, say, the English language, actually\nconsists of a symbol scheme (not to be confused with the\nabove-mentioned notion of a label \u201cschema\u201d)\u2014i.e., of\na collection of symbols, or \u201ccharacters,\u201d with rules to\ncombine them into new, compound characters\u2014associated to a field\nof reference. In the English language, for instance, the symbol scheme\nis made of characters as the letters of the Roman\nalphabet\u2014\u201ca,\u201d \u201cb,\u201d \u201cc,\u201d\netc.\u2014as well as compound characters such as \u201cape\u201d or\n\u201chouse.\u201d Each character comprises all the verbal\nutterances and ink inscriptions, i.e., all the \u201cmarks\u201d\nthat correspond to it. The mode of reference fundamental to symbol\nsystems is denotation: characters denote, stand for items in the field\nof reference. The scheme is governed by syntactical\nrules\u2014determining how to form and combine characters\u2014the\nsystem by semantic rules\u2014determining how the\nrange of symbols in the scheme refer to their field of reference.\n\nThe fundamental notion with reference to which the different\nsyntactical and semantic rules of systems can be explained is that of\na notation\u2014in brief, a symbol system where to each\nsymbol corresponds one item in the realm, and to each item in the\nrealm only one symbol in the system. Hence, for instance, a musical\nscore is a character in a notational system only if it determines\nwhich performances belong to the work and, at the same time, is\ndetermined by each of those performances (Goodman 1976,\n128\u2013130). In a notational symbol scheme all the members of a\ncharacter are interchangeable (that is, there is\n\u201ccharacter-indifference\u201d between the marks that make a\ncharacter) (Goodman 1976, 132\u2013134). Hence, for instance, the\nRoman alphabet is made of characters in a notational scheme because\nany inscription of, say, the letter \u201ca\u201d (A or\na or a\u2026) expresses the same character\nand hence can be chosen at will, and because each of such marks cannot\nbe used for any other letter of the alphabet. The same is true, for\ninstance, of the set of the basic musical symbols used in standard\nmusical notation. Accordingly, the two syntactic requirements of a\nnotation are disjointness (each mark belongs to no more than\none character) and finite differentiation, or\narticulation (in principle, it is always possible to\ndetermine to which character a mark belongs). Symbol schemes that are\nnotational can be compared in their workings to the way\ndigital instruments of measurement work: for any measurement\nindicated by the instrument there is always a definite answer to the\nquestion, What is the measurement? By contrast, schemes that are\nnon-notational are well exemplified by analog systems of\nmeasurement. For their complete lack of articulation, those systems\ncan also be said to be dense throughout: given any mark\n(e.g., a mark in a scale) it could stand for virtually an infinite\nnumber of characters, hence of measurements; or, equivalently, given\nany two marks, there is a virtually infinite number of possible\ncharacters between them. \n\nFor the symbol system also to be notational, more than\nsyntactic disjointness and finite differentiation is required. Symbol\nsystems are notational when 1) the characters are correlated to the\nfield of reference unambiguously (with no character being correlated\nto more than one class of reference, or \u201ccompliance\nclass\u201d), 2) what a character refers to\u2014the compliance\nclass\u2014must not intersect the compliance class of another\ncharacter (i.e., the characters must be semantically\ndisjoint), and 3) it is always possible to determine to which\nsymbol an item in the field of reference complies (i.e., the system\nmust be, semantically, finitely differentiated).With\nexceptions that will have to be spelled out below, a musical score in\nstandard Western notation is a character in a notational system.\nNatural languages like the English language have a notational scheme\nbut fail to be notational systems, because of ambiguities (in English,\n\u201ccape\u201d refers to a piece of land as well as to a piece of\nclothing) and lack of semantic disjointness (\u201cman\u201d and\n\u201cdoctor\u201d have some referents in common). Finally,\npictorial systems fail on both syntactic and semantic grounds.\n4. From Languages of Art to Reconceptions: New Looks at Aesthetic Issues\n\nThe rich and systematic general analysis of modes of reference and of\ntypes of symbol systems presented in Languages of Art allows\nGoodman to address fundamental questions in the philosophy of art: on\nthe nature of the different art forms and the symbolic functions that\nare central to them; on questions of ontology and the importance of\nauthenticity; on the distinction between artistic and non-artistic\nforms of symbolization; and on the role of artistic value.\n4.1 Pictorial Representation\n\nLanguages of Art prompted a lively debate especially\nconcerning Goodman\u2019s claims about the nature of pictorial\nrepresentation, or depiction. According to Goodman, the symbolic\nfunction that is distinctive of pictures is denotation (1976, Chap.\n1)\u2014hence pictures are labels and in that respect are analogous\nto linguistic predicates. The characteristics that distinguish\npictorial systems from other denotational systems (e.g., from natural\nlanguages) make them the very opposite of a notation: pictorial\nsystems are dense throughout and in that respect are similar to other\nanalog systems, such as those of diagrams and maps (1976,\n194\u2013198; Goodman, Elgin 1988, Chap. 7).\n\nAt a first approximation, Goodman\u2019s claim that \u201cdenotation\nis the core of representation\u201d (1976, 5) means that pictures are\npictorial labels for their subjects, individuals or sets of\nindividuals, analogously to how names, or predicates, or verbal\ndescriptions are linguistic labels for their denotata. Yet, of course,\nnot all pictures that have a subject\u2014i.e., all pictures that are\nrepresentational, versus images that are non-representational or\nabstract\u2014have an actual individual as their subject. Some\npictures have just a generic subject (say, a picture of a man, in the\nsense of a picture of no man in particular), others have a fictional\nsubject (a picture of a unicorn, for example). Goodman\u2019s account\nof such cases is in terms of multiple denotation for the\nformer and null denotation for the latter. Some\npictures\u2014exemplary is an illustration of an eagle placed, in a\ndictionary, next to the definition of the word\n\u201ceagle\u201d\u2014refer, severally, to all the members of a\ngiven set, such as the set of eagles. Other pictures, such as pictures\nof unicorns, refer to nothing, since there are no unicorns in reality:\nthey have null denotation. Goodman insists that the existence of\npictures with null denotation does not represent a problem for the\nview that claims that \u201cdenotation is the core of\nrepresentation.\u201d Such pictures are, of course, to be\ndistinguished from other pictures with null denotation, such as\npictures of Pegasus or of Pickwick. Yet, they are so distinguished in\nbeing pictures of a certain\nkind\u2014unicorn-pictures\u2014classified differently from pictures\nof other kinds, such as Pegasus-pictures or Pickwick-pictures.\n\nHence, Goodman appears to analyze pictorial representation as an\nambiguous concept, ambiguous, that is, between a denotational sense\n(\u201cis a picture of a so-and-so\u201d) and a non-denotational\nsense (\u201cis a so-and-so-picture\u201d). This may be seen as a\ndisadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cperceptual\u201d theories of\ndepiction such as those proposed, for instance, by Richard Wollheim\n(1987) and Kendall Walton (1990) (cf. Robinson 2000). Yet concerns on\nGoodman\u2019s treating the concept of depiction as ambiguous are\nmisplaced, for the phrase \u201cpicture of\u201d and its cognates\ncan be easily shown to admit two different interpretations. What can\nbe called the phrase\u2019s relational sense has to do with\nwhat, if anything, a picture refers to; the non-relational\nsense, instead, has to do with, as Goodman would say, the sort of\npicture it is, or better with the picture\u2019s depictive content\n(see, e.g., Budd 1993). Indeed, Goodman is right in claiming that,\nwith any picture, there are always two questions: one, what the\npicture represents, if anything; two, what kind of picture it is\n(1976, 31). Rather, a much more real problem with Goodman\u2019s\ntheory derives from his not addressing some of the most fundamental\nquestions regarding depiction. Goodman articulates his account of\nrelational depiction in some detail: pictures are symbols in symbol\nsystems that are devoted to denotation (although their members may\nhave individual, multiple, or null denotation) and that have certain\n(primarily) syntactic characteristics. Yet, Goodman has nothing to say\non why certain pictures denote what they do. Lacking a theory of\npictorial reference is no oversight on the part of the philosopher\nhowever. The fact is that Goodman is interested in investigating the\n\u201croutes\u201d of reference (1981a)\u2014how symbols can denote\nor exemplify or refer in more complex and indirect ways. He is not\ninterested in the origins, or \u201croots,\u201d of\nreference\u2014hence, with regard to pictures, in how certain marks\nand not others have become commonly correlated with certain kinds of\nitems in the world. This is as much true of what pictures are labels\nfor as of which labels apply to pictures, that is, of how they are\nclassified. Hence, it turns out, Goodman also has not much to say on\nthe non-relational sense of depiction, i.e., with what makes a picture\nthe sort of picture it is (e.g., a man-picture or a unicorn-picture or\na so-and-so-picture). Why pictures are classified in certain\nways\u2014as unicorn-pictures, man-pictures, and so\non\u2014ultimately, is a matter of entrenchment of certain predicates\nout of the many predicates available. Given the actual history of the\nuse of our symbols, certain pictorial labels (i.e., pictures) are\nprojected rather than others, and certain verbal labels are projected\nover those pictorial labels. Accordingly, for the most part,\nGoodman\u2019s theory of depiction is better seen for what it has to\ntell us on its own terms\u2014in general, on what distinguishes\npictorial symbols from symbols of other sorts.\n\nPictures are distinguished from symbols of other sorts in virtue of\nthe distinguishing characteristics of pictorial symbol systems. In\nparticular, pictorial symbol systems are syntactically and\nsemantically dense. That is, given any two marks, no\nmatter how small the difference between them, they could be\ninstantiating two different characters, and given any two characters,\nno matter how small the difference between them, they may have\ndifferent referents (Goodman 1976, 226\u2013227; Goodman, Elgin 1988,\nChap. 7). Hence, pictures are grouped together with such things as\ndiagrams, ungraduated instruments of measurement, and maps\u2014with\nthose symbols, that is, for which, in simpler words, any difference\nmay make a difference: any difference in a mark may correspond to a\ndifferent character, and any difference in the character may stand for\na different correlation to the field of reference. Even a simple\npicture, for Goodman, is dense, in the sense that any, however small,\nmark on the canvas may turn out being relevant to pictorial meaning.\nWhatever the merits of, or problems with, Goodman\u2019s technical\nanalysis, the notion of density is certainly one way to account for\nwhat other thinkers\u2014most notably Kendall Walton\n(1990)\u2014have referred to as an \u201copenendedness\u201d in the\ninvestigation of pictures.\n\nOf course, as pictures are likened to such things as diagrams, they\nalso need to be distinguished from them. Goodman\u2019s claim is that\nthe difference between pictures and diagrams is syntactic, i.e., has\nto do with the composition of the characters or symbols. Pictorial\nsymbol systems, when compared to diagrammatic systems, tend to be\nrelatively replete. That is, to the interpretation of a\npicture typically a larger number of features is relevant than to the\ninterpretation of a non-pictorial dense system. A drawing by Hokusai\nmay be made of the same marks as an electrocardiogram. Yet, while in a\nlinear diagram as the electrocardiogram only relative distances from\nthe originating point of the line matter, in the drawing a higher\nnumber of features\u2014color, thickness, intensity, contrast,\netc.\u2014are relevant (Goodman 1976, 229\u2013230). Diagrams\ntypically are relatively \u201cattenuated.\u201d Accordingly, the\ndifference between diagrams and pictures is only a matter of\ndegree: typically, with a picture a smaller number of\nfeatures can be dismissed as contingent or irrelevant.\n\nThere is indeed more that can be found in Languages of Art\nregarding depiction, and indirectly regarding the notion of being a\nso-and-so-picture or a such-and-such-picture. An important part of\nGoodman\u2019s view on depiction is his critique of the idea that\nresemblance is the distinguishing feature of this sort of\nsymbolization. While Goodman may appear to be, and is usually\ndiscussed as, criticizing the resemblance theory of pictorial\nrepresentation\u2014the \u201cmost na\u00efve view of\nrepresentation\u201d (1976, 3)\u2014his real target is indeed much\nbroader than that. After all, of the resemblance view he also claims\nthat \u201cvestiges\u201d of it, \u201cwith assorted refinements,\npersist in most writing on representation\u201d (1976, 3). What\nmainly concerns Goodman in Languages of Art is to establish\nthe symbolic, and hence ultimately conventional, nature of\npictorial representation\u2014is to draw similarities between\npictorial and nonpictorial forms of symbolization. With regard to\nresemblance, Languages of Art echoes the claim in Fact,\nFiction, and Forecast with regard to regularities: resemblances\ncan be found anywhere, for anything resembles anything else in some\nrespect or other. Hence, Goodman does not deny the existence of\nresemblances between a picture and its subject, rather he claims that\nwhich resemblances are going to be noticed depends on what the system\nof correlation employed makes relevant. To Goodman, pictorial\nrepresentation is always relative to the conceptual framework (that\nis, to the system of classification) within which a picture should be\ninterpreted, in the same way in which vision is relative to the\nconceptual frameworks with which one approaches the visual world. On\nperception, Languages of Art echoes what Goodman had already\nclaimed in his 1960 review of Ernst Gombrich\u2019s Art and\nIllusion: \u201cThat we know what we see is no truer than we see\nwhat we know. Perception depends heavily on conceptual schemata\u201d\n(Goodman 1972, 142). Thinking that vision may ever take place\nindependently of all conceptualization is to rely on the \u201cmyth\nof the innocent eye\u201d: \u201cthere is no innocent eye\n[\u2026]. Not only how but what [the eye] sees is regulated by need\nand prejudice. [The eye] selects, rejects, organizes, associates,\nclassifies, analyzes, constructs\u201d (Goodman 1976, 7\u20138).\n\nAccordingly, realism in pictorial representations is reduced\nto a matter of habit or familiarity, in contrast not\nonly to a resemblance account of realism but to accounts in terms of\namount or accuracy of conveyed information as well. Realistic pictures\ncan include inaccuracies\u2014indeed, those used in games of the type\n\u201cfind the n mistakes in the picture\u201d include\ninaccuracies by definition (Goodman 1984, 127). And the amount of\ninformation is not altered, for instance, by switching from the\nrealistic mode of representation of conventional perspective to the\nnon-realistic mode of, say, reverse perspective (Goodman 1976, 35).\nGoodman\u2019s conventionalism is pervasive and uncompromising: even\nthe rules of perspective in the representation of space, he claims,\nare conventionally established, and provide only a\nrelative\u2014i.e., relative to culturally established conceptual\nschemata\u2014standard of fidelity (1976, 10\u201319). Realistic\npaintings, drawings, etc. are those that are painted or drawn in a\nfamiliar style, i.e., according to a familiar system of correlation.\nTo put it metaphorically, for Goodman, you always need a key to read a\npicture\u2014sometimes the key is more ready at hand, part of\none\u2019s cultural background, other times one must find it and\nlearn how to use it.\n\nThere are claims, in Goodman\u2019s account of depiction, that are\nleft unexplained, especially with respect to pictures with\nindeterminate or fictional reference, that is, with pictures that\nGoodman would classify by predicates like \u201cman-picture,\u201d\n\u201cunicorn-pictures,\u201d etc. Of them, Goodman claims that they\nhave \u201cpurported\u201d denotation (1976, 67), yet without saying\nanything on how that should contribute to pictorial meaning.\nFurthermore, as the analysis progresses, and keeps facing the\nnecessity to account for pictures with indeterminate or fictional\nreference, as well as with the notion of representation-as\n(as in a picture that represents Winston Churchill as a bulldog), a\nsomewhat puzzling claim makes its way into Goodman\u2019s account:\nthat depiction in such cases is really a matter of\nexemplification\u2014exemplification of labels such as\n\u201cunicorn-picture,\u201d \u201cman-picture,\u201d or\n\u201cbulldog-picture\u201d (1976, 66). The motivation for such a\nclaim may be that of finding, after all, a mode of reference capable\nof explaining the way in which such pictures have meaning, i.e., of\naddressing the above-mentioned non-relational sense of depiction. Yet,\nGoodman provides no argument to support the claim that a picture\nrepresenting, say, a unicorn is not just denoted by labels\nsuch as \u201cunicorn-picture\u201d but also refers back to\nthose labels. Lack of actual or determinate reference cannot be\nsufficient to establish that an item denoted by a label refers back to\nthat label. Furthermore, precisely because samples refer to the labels\ndenoting them selectively, an argument would be needed to the effect\nthat pictures of unicorns exemplify such labels as\n\u201cof-a-unicorn,\u201d rather than labels as, say,\n\u201cpicture\u201d or even \u201cpainted by someone\u201d or\n\u201cpainted canvas,\u201d which after all are labels applying to\nsuch pictures.\n\nIn fact, in light of the above-mentioned ambiguity in the concept of\ndepiction, hence of the fundamental distinction between a relational\nand a non-relational sense of \u201cpicture of,\u201d we should\nemphasize how much is left out of Goodman\u2019s attempted\naccount of the concept. Notice how pictures may or may not represent\nsomething, i.e., relationally; yet, insofar as they have depicted\ncontent, they all are, non-relationally, O-pictures, or\nP-pictures, etc., that is, pictures with an O, or P, etc. content.\nSuch non-relational sense of depiction is indeed the one a theory of\ndepiction ought to investigate (cf. Budd 1993), and Goodman\u2019s\ngeneral claims on the syntactic and semantic characteristics of\npictorial (vs. verbal, or musical, or diagrammatic, etc.) symbol\nsystems do not seem able to encompass the fundamental question about\nsuch a notion, hence in a sense the fundamental question for any\ntheory of pictorial representation (cf. Giovannelli 1997). To\nillustrate, Goodman\u2019s account offers suggestions on what makes a\nsymbol a picture of a dog rather than a verbal description of a dog;\nat a very general level, the account has also something to say on what\nmakes a symbol a dog-picture rather than a dog-description. Yet, the\nfundamental question for a theory of depiction is what it means that a\npicture is a dog-picture, i.e., a picture with a dog as its depictive\ncontent, a picture in which competent viewers see a dog, instead of,\nsay, a cat-picture, i.e., a picture in which competent viewer see a\ncat. For better or worse, perceptual theories of depiction offer an\nanswer to that question; yet, no real competing answer is to\nbe found in Goodman. As mentioned, why some type of marks have become\ncorrelated with a certain kind of depictive content (hence presumably\nprompting a visual perception of such content when looking at the\npicture) is a matter of entrenchment; and that, in turn, is a question\nfor the anthropologist and the historian, not the philosopher,\naccording to Goodman.\n4.2 Expression and Exemplification in Art\n\nThe notion of exemplification allows Goodman to offer his theory of\nexpression. More generally, it allows him to indicate an\nimportant source of meaning in addition to denotation. Most works of\nmusic, dance, and architecture, as well as abstract paintings, do not\nrepresent anything at all. Yet, Goodman can show how, next to\nartworks\u2019 representational powers we must recognize, as a\ncentral and pervasive form of symbolization in art, the capacity for\nartworks to call attention to some of their features, that is, to\nexemplify them.\n\nAs for the features that an artwork appears to exemplify despite its\nnot, literally, possessing them (as when, for instance, a painting is\nclaimed to express sadness in spite of the fact that paintings cannot\nliterally be sad) Goodman claims that such features are\nmetaphorically exemplified, or expressed. In brief,\na work of art expresses something when it metaphorically exemplifies\nit. Accordingly, expression is not limited to feelings and emotions\nbut comprises any feature that can be metaphorically attributed to an\nartwork: in architecture, for instance, a building may express\nmovement, dynamism, or being \u201cjazzy\u201d although, literally,\nit can\u2019t have any of those properties (Goodman, Elgin 1988,\n40).\n\nTo expression and exemplification, too, the general rule for which the\nrelationship between a symbol and what it symbolizes is never\n\u201cabsolute, universal, or immutable\u201d (1976, 50) applies.\nHence, like representation, exemplification and expression are\nrelative, in particular they are relative to established use (Goodman\n1976, 48).\n\nGoodman\u2019s suggestions on the role of exemplification in art are\nin many ways enlightening. Applied to art, the notion seems to provide\nsemantic theories, like Goodman\u2019s, with a way to justify the\nattention we pay, not just to what an artwork symbolizes, by to the\nartwork itself: we do so because we are made privy of, and are\ninterested in, those of a work\u2019s features that are shown forth,\ni.e., exemplified (cf. van der Berg 2012, 603). The notion allows to\nexpand the number of features that are deemed significant in a work,\nwhile still explaining such significance in referential terms. A poem,\nfor instance, is not just a representational symbol; typically, what a\npoetic work exemplifies is as important to its meaning and artistic\nvalue as what the work represents. Accordingly, the goal of the\ntranslator must be \u201cmaximal preservation of what the original\nexemplifies as well as of what it says\u201d (1976, 60). As for\nexpression, expanding the scope of the properties that can be\nmetaphorically exemplified, beyond the strictly emotional ones, adds\nexplanatory power to the theory, making it possible to say, e.g., that\na sculpture expresses fluidity (cf. Robinson 2000, 216).\n\nAs is the case for Goodman\u2019s analysis of depiction, with regard\nto exemplification and expression in art, too, one wonders whether\nGoodman\u2019s claims are meant to provide an exhaustive account of\nsuch notions, and not rather just a very general, structural, analysis\nof them. Whichever the case, Goodman\u2019s proposal is much more\nacceptable at that general level. More specific claims, such as that\nexpression and exemplification are relative to the conventionally\nestablished symbol systems at work, like the analogous claim regarding\nrepresentation, prompt questions on the necessity, for Goodman, to\nrecognize naturalistic constraints on what can be exemplified, or\nexpressed, or represented by what. More importantly, when we examine\nspecific cases, it becomes unclear whether the distinction between\nexemplification in general and expression in particular has been well\ndrawn. Since, for Goodman, not only feelings and emotions can be\nexpressed but also such properties as color or sound pitch, one\nwonders what notion \u201cexpressing red,\u201d said of a non-red\nsymbol, amounts to: how different is it from the notion referred to by\n\u201cexpressing sadness\u201d said of something (a musical sonata)\nthat literally is not sad? Furthermore, as a more general concern on\nGoodman\u2019s project of accounting for the nature, interpretation,\nand values of artworks fully extensionalistically (i.e., just in terms\nonly of what they refer to), one wonders whether the role of property\npossession is not undermined by Goodman\u2019s insistence on\nwhat a work exemplifies. Certainly, works of art have significant\nfeatures that they simply possess, without also exemplifying them. A\nwork of art may have to be recognized as, e.g., calm just in the sense\nof having such feature (if needed, having it metaphorically), and such\nfeature be recognized as relevant to the work\u2019s nature and\nvalue\u2014as something that the beholder ought to\nperceive\u2014without it being the case that the work\nexemplifies or expresses calmness.\n\nBe as it may, it is certainly worth considering whether expression,\nhence exemplification, by requiring possession, requires possession\nthat precedes the item\u2019s acquiring exemplifying function. It\ncould be the case that endowing a work with an exemplification\nfunction could, at once, endow the work with the feature it\nexemplifies, a suggestion that seems especially apt to works of art\n(cf. van der Berg 2012). Whether something like that could be\nexplained, as Goodman would want it, with no reference to either the\nintentions of artists or, more generally, the context of artistic\nproduction remains to be seen. Certainly\u2014and the concern, here,\nis not just about expression, but about metaphorical reference and\nexemplification more generally\u2014the suspicion arises that\nGoodman\u2019s approach, in relying solely on the notion of symbol\nsystem to explain reference (i.e., to explain what a symbol refers to\nand how it does refer to it), ends up underanalyzing the key notions\nat play: exemplification, metaphorical reference, and, hence,\nexpression. Goodman\u2019s own understanding of symbol systems is\nthat they emerge when certain rules are codified. Yet, of course,\nartists may succeed, it seems, at securing reference and endowing\ntheir works with artistically relevant features within, and thanks to,\na specific context of production. Appeal to the rules of a system may\nnot be sufficient to explain how reference is indeed secured. That is,\nand going back to an issue mentioned above, the rules of a system may\nnever be granular enough to offer a full explanation of how a work of\nart exemplifies some of its features but not others, or is\nsuccessfully made to possess, metaphorically, features it\nexpresses.\n4.3 Conditions of Identity for Works of Art\n\nGoodman\u2019s theory of symbol systems, as composed of schemes of\ncharacters that are governed, depending on the sort of system, by\ndifferent syntactical rules, and correlated to their extensions\naccording to differing semantic rules, is at the basis of his claims\non the identity conditions of works of art of different kinds. Given\nthe syntactic and semantic characteristics of notational systems, the\ndifferent art forms can be arranged on a spectrum made of the sorts of\nsystems that stand between a pure notation\u2014where there is\nperfect preservation of identity between replicas (or performances) of\nthe work\u2014and fully dense pictorial systems\u2014where every\nwork is an original.\n\nGoodman relates the issue of identity of works to whether a\nwork\u2019s history of production is integral to the work or\nnot. In brief, it appears that in painting and related art forms, such\nas drawing, watercolor, and the like (where there is only one instance\nof a work), but also in etching, woodcut, and the like (where there\ncan be multiple instances of the same work), aspects of the\nwork\u2019s history of production are indeed essential to the\nidentity of the work. Only the actual canvas that was painted by\nRaphael in 1505 counts as the Madonna del Granduca, and only\nthose prints that come from the original plate used by Rembrandt for\nhis Self-Portrait with a Velvet Cap with Plume (1638) count\nas the originals of that work\u2014anything else is a copy, however\napparently indistinguishable from the original. Art forms like\npainting and etching are for this reason named by Goodman\n\u201cautographic\u201d arts: \u201ca work of art is autographic if\nand only if the distinction between original and forgery of it is\nsignificant; or better, if and only if even the most exact duplication\nof it does not thereby count as genuine\u201d (1976, 113). You are\nlooking at Raphael\u2019s Madonna or at Rembrandt\u2019s\nSelf-Portrait only if you are looking at specific items\nproperly connected, historically, to the artist who produced them. By\ncontrast, music, dance, theater, literature, architecture seem to\nallow, although in different ways, for instantiations of the work that\nare independent of the work\u2019s history of production. You can\nlisten to a performance of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony\neven if it is performed (as it would normally be) from a contemporary\nprint of the score. Art forms like music, dance, etc., accordingly,\ncan be called \u201callographic.\u201d\n\nAs the examples above already illustrate, the distinction between\nautographic and allographic arts is not the same as that between arts\nthat are singular and those that are multiple. Etching, for instance,\nis still autographic although multiple. Incidentally, this could allow\nGoodman to account for the interesting hypothesis, advanced by Gregory\nCurrie (1989), of superxerox machines capable of reproducing paintings\nin a molecule-by-molecule faithful way. Such a cloning technique,\nGoodman could say, would transform the art of painting from singular\nto multiple, and yet without changing it from autographic to\nallographic.\n\nNor is the autographic/allographic distinction to be confused with\nthat between one- and two-stage art forms, so distinguished according\nto whether the realization of the work requires some form of\nexecution. A painting (which is autographic) is accessible once\ncompleted, while a theatrical play (allographic) requires a\nperformance. Yet, allographic arts, too, can be one-stage, e.g., in\nthe case of a novel, and autographic arts be two-stage\u2014woodcut\nfor example.\n\nMore relevantly, Goodman articulates his theory of work identity by\naddressing whether a given art form allows for a notational system,\ni.e., for a \u201cscore\u201d that would \u201cspecify the\nessential properties a performance must have to belong to the\nwork\u201d (1976, 212). Accordingly, Goodman\u2019s can also be seen\nas a novel way to account for the fact that some art\nforms\u2014painting and sculpture for instance\u2014do not allow for\nperformances, while other art forms\u2014such as music and\ndance\u2014do. Advanced at first as a tentative approach, and indeed,\nthroughout presented as open to revisions, the proposal is developed\nsomewhat systematically, with the clear intent of showing its\npotential for becoming a general and comprehensive theory. Music,\npainting, literature, theater, dance, and architecture are all\naddressed with respect to the question of their relationships with the\nsyntactic and semantic requirements of a notation. Goodman\u2019s\nframework ends up being quite technical, given the need to refer to\nand explain the syntactic and semantic characteristics of notational\nsystems. Also, such terms as \u201cscore,\u201d\n\u201cscript,\u201d and \u201csketch,\u201d which all acquire\nspecialized meanings. By the same token, the questions are not asked\nhypothetically or just as a mental exercise\u2014in that sense,\ntrivial notations could be devised for any art form (Goodman,\nElgin 1988, Chap. 7). Rather, the questions are addressed with\nreference to the systems of notations already existing, when they do,\nand, more generally, with awareness of the actual history of the\nvarious art forms.\n\nNaturally, music and painting (and with the latter, of course,\nsculpture) end up standing on opposite sides of the spectrum, the\nfirst being allographic and allowing for a notation, the second\nautographic and not admitting of any notation compatible with\npractice. A work of music is, for Goodman, \u201cthe class\nof performances compliant with a character\u201d (1976, 210), where\nthe character is the musical work\u2019s score. Consider that music\nwritten in standard musical notation is, for the most part\u2014or,\nmore precisely, for the \u201cmain corpus of peculiarly musical\ncharacters\u201d (Goodman 1976, 183), i.e., for the flags arranged on\nthe pentagram\u2014in a notational language. All and only those\nperformances that fully correspond to, or \u201ccomply with,\u201d\nthe score count as performances of the work. Even one small mistake on\nthe part of the performer, say, in replacing one note for another, is\nsufficient to declare that, technically, a different work has been\nperformed. On the other hand, other, important aspects of standard\nmusical notation are not in a notational system: indications\nof tempo, for instance, as well as the convention of letting the\nperformer choose the cadenza, give great latitude to the performer.\nHence, in Goodman\u2019s view, while two performances that sound\nalmost exactly alike may not be performances of the same work,\nradically differently sounding performances may be. Notice, however,\nhow the question of identity is here sharply distinct from the\nquestion of value: \u201cthe most miserable performance without\nactual mistakes does count as [a genuine instance of a work], while\nthe most brilliant performance with a single wrong note does\nnot\u201d (Goodman 1976, 186).\n\nOne might be tempted to dismiss Goodman\u2019s proposals for their\nconflicting with ordinary language and musical practice. Yet, it is\nmost important to remember that Goodman is aware of ordinary practice\nand does not expect it to comply with the philosopher\u2019s\ntechnical requirements (as \u201cone hardly expects chemical purity\noutside the laboratory\u201d [1976, 186]). Nor is he interested in\nreforming ordinary language: \u201cI am no more recommending that in\nordinary discourse we refuse to say that a pianist who misses a note\nhas performed a Chopin Polonaise than that we refuse to call a whale a\nfish, the earth spherical, or a grayish-pink human white\u201d\n(Goodman 1976, 187). Indeed, Goodman\u2019s approach to the question\nof notation is, in an important sense, grounded in previous practice,\nfor a notational system is an acceptable one only when projected\nfrom a previous classification of works. Furthermore, the history\nof an art form may include (as music did) an autographic stage, which\nonly at a later time made room for the establishment of a notation, on\nthe grounds of previous practice. Nor is Goodman\u2019s approach\nlacking in application to real musical cases, as his discussion of\nalternative musical notations proves. Without, again, evaluating the\ndifferent systems of musical notation, Goodman shows how an\nalternative system, such as the one proposed by John Cage, is not\nnotational, and is indeed in important ways closer to a\n\u201csketch,\u201d hence to a drawing, than to a score (Goodman\n1976, 187\u2013190).\n\nWhat was just said about music also applies largely, in\nGoodman\u2019s view, to the art of dance. While dance does\nnot yet have a standard notation, Goodman finds the tentative notation\nproposed by Rudolf Laban (which indeed Laban proposed for movement in\ngeneral) to be a good candidate for a notational system, indeed one\nwith fewer departures from notationality than standard musical\nnotation. And here is one of the many areas where the results of an\naesthetic investigation, however tentative, may be relevant to other\nareas of human knowledge and activity. Goodman points out how a\nsuccessful notation for human movement could be of great assistance in\nstudies ranging from psychology to industrial engineering, in which it\nis of utmost importance to find criteria for determining whether, say,\na subject or an experimenter has repeated the same behavior: and\n\u201cthe problem of formulating such criteria is the problem of\ndeveloping a notational system\u201d (1976, 218).\n\nThe conclusion that Goodman reaches about architecture is\nalso a good indicator of the importance placed, in his analysis, on\nthe actual history of an art form. Goodman claims that architecture\ndoes have, in the architect\u2019s plans, something quite close to a\nnotational system, and hence is, because of that, an allographic art:\ndifferent buildings, built in different locations and even with\ncertain differences in materials, would be instances of the same\nwork, provided that they correspond to the same plan. Yet, aware\nof the history of the art form, namely, of its origins as an\nautographic art and of a certain dependence, even today, on the\nparticular history of production of the particular building, Goodman\nconcludes that in fact \u201carchitecture is a mixed and transitional\ncase\u201d (1976, 221). \n\nAs said, painting stands at the opposite extreme from a\nnotational system, since works in this art form are\n\u201canalogs,\u201d characters in syntactically and semantically\ndense systems. It is important to emphasize how that does not mean\nthat a classification of paintings according to a notational system\ncould not be found, or even found easily: a library-type\nclassification for paintings for instance. What it does mean, however,\nis that, given the history of the medium and of the ways of\nclassifying works of painting, a library-type notation would be\nincompatible with established artistic practice. The painting itself\n(or, in the case of etching, only the prints using the original plate)\ncounts (or count) as the work. And what is true of painting\nis true of the sketches that precede the painting. The sketch itself\nis a work of art, and one that is autographic, in spite of its being\nused as a guide to the production of the final work (Goodman 1976,\n192\u2013194).\n\nSince the question of whether a notational system can be devised for a\ngiven art form is ultimately a question on the possibility of a\n\u201clanguage\u201d for that art form, i.e., at least of a\nnotational scheme, art forms that use natural language bear\ninteresting and sometimes surprising results. With a novel, poem, or\nthe script used for a play or movie, the text is a character in a\nnotational scheme. However, what counts as a work in such art forms is\ndifferent. In theater or drama, a work is a set of\nperformances compliant with what established in the script. As in the\ncase of music, Goodman\u2019s analyses involve a departure from the\nordinary use of language: the dialogue of a play really works as a\n\u201cscore,\u201d while stage directions and the like are a\n\u201cscript\u201d\u2014the former is fully notational,\nsyntactically and semantically, the latter does not uniquely determine\nthe performance, nor is it uniquely determined by the performance\n(1976, 210\u201311). It is the \u201cscore\u201d part of the text\nthat allows, in theater, for the work to be located in the set of\nperformances. By contrast, with a novel or a poem,\nwhere no \u201cscore\u201d is part of the text, and hence the text\nis a \u201cscript,\u201d the work, Goodman claims, is the text\nitself (understood as a set of inscriptions fully corresponding, in\nspelling and punctuation, with each other). Even in the later work,\nReconceptions, Goodman reemphasizes this claim (1988a,\n49-65). While endorsing pluralism with regard to the number of correct\ninterpretations (i.e., \u201capplications\u201d) a text may\nyield\u2014indeed considering it often a positive feature of the\nartistic use of language\u2014Goodman insists that the work, in\nliterary art, is the text. Hence, in Jorge Luis\nBorges\u2019s famous Pierre Menard case (that of a fictional\nFrench author trying to write a novel word-for-word identical to\nCervantes\u2019s Don Quixote [Borges 1962]), Goodman claims\nthat what Menard produced was another inscription of Don\nQuixote\u2019s text, hence an instance of the same work, albeit\nwith his actions Menard may have suggested a possible, new\ninterpretation of that work. Incidentally, the contrast between\ntheater and the literature more narrowly conceived (i.e., as not\nincluding drama) may raise a question regarding poetry. Qua text with\nmeaning (or \u201capplications\u201d, a poetic work is the text\nitself; yet, qua text to be performed, e.g., recited out loud for an\naudience, the poem would seem to be considered a character in a\nnotational system, a \u201cscore\u201d with as its field of\nreference the sounds to be uttered. On the other hand, in\ncinema, an art form Goodman does not address, again, one\ncould identify, within the screenplay, a \u201cscore\u201d in the\nparts that indicate dialogue, a \u201cscript\u201d in the scene and\ninstructions, with the ontology of the film itself, however, being\nthat of a multiple art form made of the concrete reproductions of the\nvisual and audio recordings that are displayed in the movie theater or\non the TV screen.\n\nGoodman\u2019s theory of notation, and the analysis of the differing\nways in which different art forms relate to that notion, establish\nalmost a system for the arts, one that perhaps has not yet received\nsufficient credit from theorists working in aesthetics. Instead, for\nthe most part contemporary discussion has concentrated on individual\nart forms and problematic examples.\n\nWithin the ontology of music, the claim for which the score fully, and\nsolely, individuates the work has received the most attention.\nSeparating ontological from evaluative claims, as seen above, Goodman\ncould not state his stance on the matter more clearly: \u201cthe most\nmiserable performance without actual mistakes\u201d counts as an\ninstance of a work, \u201cwhile the most brilliant performance with\none wrong note does not\u201d (1976, 186). Of the two claims, that\ncompliance with a score is necessary for a performance to be\nconsidered a bona fide instance of a musical work has been received\nwith way more controversy than the one for which full compliance is\nsufficient to declare a performance a legitimate work instance. The\nformer claim may seem naturally problematic. First of all, it clearly\nconflicts with actual practice. Of course, as mentioned, Goodman does\nnot aim at reforming ordinary usage. Hence, his view is a form of what\nin art ontological discussions has become known as\n\u201crevisionism\u201d (versus \u201cdescriptivism\u201d; cf.\nDodd 2012) only in the sense that it separates ontological claims from\nactual artistic and art critical practices, thus allowing for even\nradical departures from such practices\u2014yet, again, without\nadvocating their modification. Even if all that is granted, to many,\nincluding thinkers who are sympathetic to the approach, Goodman\u2019s\nleaving no wiggle-room, so as to allow the inclusion of performances\nthat defer from the score for just minor mistakes (when not welcome\nchanges), is problematic. Indeed, and further, there seems to be a\nconceptual problem in making sense of the claim on brilliant and yet\nwrong performances. For, of course, if a performance is wrong, hence\nfails to be an instance of a work, how can it then be referred to as\n\u201cbrilliant,\u201d i.e., a brilliant performance, ultimately,\nof such work (Ridley 2013)? The more general and interesting\nquestion, here, may be whether Goodman\u2019s theory has the resources to\naccount for the kinship an incorrect performance of Beethoven\u2019s\nFifth Symphony has to the Fifth, which other musical\npieces (performances of Three Blind Mice to use\nGoodman\u2019s example) lack. Again, on Goodman\u2019s behalf, dividing,\nhere, might be the only way to conquer. The ontological claim on what\nindividuates an artwork\u2014hence, on what counts as a bona fide\ninstance or performance of a work\u2014is in itself independent of\nclaims, in themselves not even philosophical, on what makes a musical\npiece recognizably similar (or virtually identical) to another. None\nof Goodman\u2019s ontological claims need to deny such empirical facts.\nFurther, recognizability, here, may interestingly intersect with\nsymbolization. After all, Goodman is keenly interested in the symbolic\nrelations between works of art (including, e.g., works that count as\nvariations on the same theme; see 1976, 260\u2013261, and Goodman,\nElgin 1988, Chap. 4). A performance that aims, say, at an especially\nintense and driven rendering of a piece and, as a consequence of that,\nincludes, perhaps unavoidably, departures from the prescribed notes,\nmay be considered a (brilliant) rendering of such a piece by\nvirtue of reference to, including exemplication of, the piece as\nindividuated by the original score, although, ontologically, be\nconsidered\u2014as it should be, Goodman would insist\u2014an\ninstance of a distinct work.\n\nEspecially when concentrating on just one art form and, hence,\npossibly losing sight of Goodman\u2019s more general and systematic\nproject, it might pass unnoticed that the separation between\nevaluative and ontological claims, in Goodman, is borne by an approach\nfor which whatever individuates an artwork in the different art forms\ndoes not necessarily individuate all of the artwork\u2019s\nproperties, in which, aesthetically, we are interested. What Goodman\nsays, e.g., about literature applies to all art forms: \u201cdefining\nliterary works no more calls for setting forth all their significant\naesthetic properties than defining metals calls for setting forth all\ntheir significant chemical properties\u201d (1976, 210). After all,\nin art forms like music written according to traditional Western\nnotation, which have developed a notation, we are legitimately\ninterested in the different performances of a work of art\u2014and in\nthe best ones among them\u2014precisely because what defines them as\nperformances of a work is not the same as the set of aesthetic\nproperties the work has to offer. On the other hand, one might be\nsuspicious of the degree of inclusiveness of aesthetic properties\n(i.e., of non-work-defining properties that may nonetheless be the\nobject of aesthetic attention) Goodman allows. That is, one might\nwonder whether the sufficiency claim, for which mere\ncompliance with a \u201cscore\u201d (in Goodman\u2019s technical sense\nof the term) is all that is needed to identify, within art forms that\nhave notations, bona fide work instances. With respect to the\nallographic arts, Goodman is opposed to making any concession to the\nrelevance of historical properties to the individuation of\nartworks\u2014it\u2019s all left to the rules of the notation, at the\nsyntactic or, if applicable, the semantic level. Hence, a work of\nmusic is whatever the \u201cscore,\u201d semantically, individuates;\nand a work of literature is the text itself, the\n\u201cscript,\u201didentified by the syntactic requirements of\nnotations. Yet, in either case, there would be room for a modified\nnotion of the allographic (investigated, for music, by Levinson 1980),\naccording to which a \u201cscore\u201d or a \u201cscript\u201d are\nbest understood, not just as structures, but as ones projected within\ngiven contexts. Such a move would allow restricting the range of\naesthetic properties a given artwork can comprise. A performance of\nBeethoven\u2019s Fifth executed so as to last a year, within\nsuch a notion of the allographic, could be considered the performance\nof a derivative (and bizarre) work, not of the Fifth.\nSimilarly, interpretations of a novel that were to run against what is\ncompatible with a given historically located projection (say, because\nanachronistic, or because incompatible with the genre a work is in)\ncould, then, be declared inadmissible, or admissible as\ninterpretations of an identical text, yet one projected within a\ndifferent context and effectively amounting to a different work.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing how Goodman, although he begins his\ninvestigation with the autographic/allographic distinction (indeed\nintroduced as a rough approximation), aims at developing an account of\nthe role notation, at the syntactic or semantic level, plays within\ncertain arts but not others. The result is not just an explanation of\nthe autographic nature of some arts and the allographic nature of\nothers. It is a way more articulated account of the variety of ways in\nwhich notationality, when present, has authority in identifying\nartworks in the various arts, hence in differently determining the\nlocalization of what counts as the artwork. To sum up, where a\n\u201cscore\u201d is present, hence syntactic and semantic\nnotationality, usually, the work is a compliance class of\nperformances. Where a \u201cscript\u201d is present, hence a\nnotation only at the syntactic level, usually, the work is a class of\ninscriptions compliant with such script. Where notation is not\nestablished at either the semantic or the syntactic level, there is a\n\u201csketch,\u201d which is usually the work itself, as a concrete\nindividual or series of concrete individuals.\n\nThe complexity of the approach invites caution towards dismissing\nGoodman\u2019s reasoning on the grounds of alleged counterexamples.\nIt is quite clear how Goodman, throughout his work, takes himself as\nmostly offering \u201csuggestions\u201d towards a theory, not yet a\ncomplete one. Further, what he says about architecture, and the art\nform\u2019s being a \u201cmixed and transitional\u201d case, or\nabout drama, and its comprising, in the text of the play,\n\u201cscore\u201d and \u201cscript,\u201d suggests looking at\nways, which Goodman seems to foresee, of combining parts of his\naccount, and achieving more fine-grained results than the mere verdict\non whether an art form is allographic or autographic, notational or\nnot. Hence, in addition to what mentioned above about poetry and\ncinema, it is worth wondering what Goodman could say of certain forms\nof installation and conceptual art. For example, when Sol LeWitt gave\ninstructions to create hisWall Drawings (works that were,\nthen, realized by other individuals), was he producing works that\nrepresent an insurmountable challenge to Goodman\u2019s distinctions\n(cf. Pillow 2003)? One possibility would be to consider LeWitt\u2019s\ninstructions as a \u201cscript,\u201d which could in itself be\ncounted as an artwork (much as a literary work), but, also, as\ninstructions for the production of distinct works, constituted by the\ndrawings actually realized. Such drawings, in turn, could be\nconsidered variations on the \u201ctheme\u201d indicated by those\ninstructions, while each an individual work, a concrete\n\u201csketch\u201d; or, perhaps, each of LeWitt\u2019s Wall\nDrawings is best considered a work with unusual mereology, a\ncompound made of the \u201csketches\u201d\u2014one by one or all\ntogether \u2014and those instructions. Whatever the answer to the\nquestions arising in individual cases, the Goodmanian framework, with\nall its limits and underdeveloped areas, can clearly offer a range of\npossibilities and conceptual intersections. Somewhat relatedly,\nGoodman\u2019s willingness to claim that there are cases, as with the\nclass of performances of a John Cage\u2019s composition embodied in a\nnon-conventional score that qualifies as a \u201csketch,\u201d in\nwhich work identity fails to be established (Goodman 1972b, 83-84),\nmay be worthy of further consideration, as the various developments\nwithin art may have to make room for cases in which the identity of a\nwork is uncertain. \n4.4 Authenticity\n\nAn issue closely related to the ontological question of the identity\nof the work of art in the various art forms\u2014indeed the very\nissue that Goodman uses, in Languages of Art, to introduce\nhis theory of notation\u2014is that of the importance of\nauthenticity in art and of the aesthetic relevance of being a\nforgery. (Goodman\u2019s comments on the question of forgery prompted\na small debate on that issue, mostly represented in a collection\nedited by Denis Dutton [1983].) The brief answer is that authenticity\nmatters only where there is no notationality. Hence, for instance, it\nmakes no difference whether a musical piece is performed from the\noriginal score or from a copy congruent with that, since the score is\nin a notational scheme. Yet it does matter whether one is presented\nwith an original Rembrandt or with a copy of it, since paintings are\nanalogs, symbols in syntactically dense systems.\n\nWith regard to two visually indiscernible paintings, an original and a\ncopy, Goodman addresses the question whether there is any aesthetic\ndifference between the two pictures (1976, 99\u2013102). Notice that,\nif there is a difference, it must not depend on what one can visually\ndiscern at the present time, for ex hypothesis, there is no\nsuch visual difference that can currently be detected. Goodman\u2019s\nanswer is that there is an aesthetic difference between the two\npaintings even now, when we are unable to tell one painting from the\nother, for an awareness that one is the original and the other a copy\ninforms us that a difference may be perceived, and indeed modifies our\npresent perception of the two paintings: now, for instance,\nwe look for differences between the two paintings, we train\nour eyes and minds to discriminate differences that are currently\nindiscernible (1976, 103\u2013105). Goodman\u2019s takes his claims\nto be general and as granting the conclusion that \u201cthe aesthetic\nproperties of a picture include not only those found by looking at it\nbut also those the determine how it is to be looked at\u201d (1976,\n111\u2013112). Hence, even with pictures that are not\n\u201cperfect\u201d copies of other pictures, indeed with\nany picture, knowing how it should be\nclassified\u2014including its classification by authorship, as a\nRembrandt, a Vermeer, or a Van Meegeren\u2014makes a difference to\nhow the picture may be perceived. For perceiving is, after all,\ndetermined by the labels that one projects over what is presented in\nfront of one\u2019s eyes. It must be noticed, then, that this claim\nis all within a theory of perception and, while claiming that\nnon-perceptible features are relevant to perception, hence are\nrelevant to aesthetic experience, it does not claim that\nnon-perceptible features as such are relevant to aesthetic\nexperience.\n4.5 Artistic Style\n\nGoodman\u2019s account of style is a good example of a Goodmanian\n\u201creconception\u201d: the philosophical approach to the issue\nmust not only abandon the characterization of style as related to form\nand hence contrasted to content (for, after all, that an author\nwrites, say, of social issues rather than battles should count as an\naspect of the author\u2019s style), but must, most importantly,\nrecognize the role that classifications in terms of style have in\nunderstanding and appreciating a work. \n\nGoodman invites us to recognize elements of style in a work\u2019s\ncontent, in its form, and in the feelings\nit expresses. His proposal is that the stylistic features of a work\nmake up a subset of the features \u201cof what is said, of what is\nexemplified, or of what is expressed\u201d (Goodman 1978a, 32). In\nparticular, stylistic features are those symbolic properties of a work\nthat allow us to place the work in a certain place, time period, and\nartist\u2019s oeuvre. That is, style properties help in answering\nquestions as \u201cwhere?\u201d, \u201cwhen?\u201d,\n\u201cwho?\u201d with respect to a work\u2014they function,\nmetaphorically, as a signature for a work: \u201cstyle\nconsists of those features of the symbolic functioning of a work that\nare characteristic of author, period, place, or school\u201d (1978a,\n35). Given what Goodman has said, when discussing the issue of\nauthenticity, regarding the aesthetic importance of historical\nproperties of a painting, knowing the style of an artwork is\naesthetically relevant, since \u201cknowledge of the origin of a work\n[\u2026] informs the way the work is to be looked at or listened to\nor read, providing a basis for the discovery of nonobvious ways the\nwork differs from and resembles other works\u201d (1978a, 38). It is\nin virtue of stylistic properties\u2019 link to the symbolic\nfunctions of a work of art that identifying a work\u2019s style,\nespecially when complex and challenging and even difficult to\nidentify, is integral to \u201cthe understanding of works of art and\nthe worlds they present\u201d (1978a, 40).\n4.6 The Question of the Aesthetic and the Question of Merit\n\nGoodman\u2019s conclusions, on what roughly could be considered the\nquestion of what is art as well as on the question of artistic value,\nfollow from his view that aesthetics is really a branch of\nepistemology and that there is ultimately no sharp division between\nart and other forms of human knowledge.\n\nThe aims of art are the aims of symbolic activity in general, and they\nhave to do with understanding. (Understanding is, for\nGoodman, a broader concept than knowledge, one that is not bound by\nliteral truth, and that is thus applicable also to the literally false\nand to what admits of no truth value: metaphors and paintings for\nexample.) Artistic symbols, as symbols in general, are to be judged\nfor the classifications they bring about, for how novel and insightful\nthose categorizations are, for how they change our perception of the\nworld and relations to it. The cognitive value of art counts as\nartistic merit only because the symbols involved and the\nexperiences they bring about belong in some sense to what Goodman\nrefers to as \u201cthe aesthetic.\u201d Hence, the question of when\nsuch symbolic activities and experiences are aesthetic or artistic is\nimportant, although, for Goodman, more in order to recognize the\ncommonalities between art and other human activities, including\nscience, than to isolate the artistic or aesthetic realm from other\nareas of knowledge and experience. \n\nGoodman proposes no definition of art nor of what makes an experience\naesthetic. Since to be a work of art is, for Goodman, to perform\ncertain referential functions, the question \u201cWhat is art?\u201d\nshould be replaced with the question \u201cWhen is art?\u201d. That\nis, the real issue is to know when, typically at least, the symbolic\nactivity in question has features that bring us to call it\n\u201cartistic.\u201d Hence, he suggests the existence of\nsymptoms of the aesthetic, i.e., symbol systems\u2019\ncharacteristics that tend to occur in art. In Languages of\nArt, they were tentatively presented as conjunctively sufficient\nand disjunctively necessary for an experience to be aesthetic. There\nGoodman indicated four of such symptoms: syntactic density,\nsemantic density, syntactic repleteness, and\nexemplificationality (1976, 252\u2013255). In Ways of\nWorldmaking, the list is enriched by a fifth element:\nmultiple and complex reference (Goodman 1978a, 67\u201368).\nIn his later contribution that those are only symptoms seems to be\ntaken even more literally: they are clues that indicate but do not\nguarantee the presence of a work of art; and artistic status is\npossible even without them. In other words, Goodman\u2019s tentative\nclaims on this issue point to symbolic activities and features of\nsymbolic activity that artworks tend to instantiate. On these\ngrounds, Goodman can once again claim that \u201c[a]rt and science\nare not altogether alien\u201d (1976, 255). The same features that\nare characteristic, for instance, of numerical calculation\u2014e.g.,\narticulateness\u2014can be found in musical scores, and the same\nfeatures that could be called aesthetic\u2014such as\nexemplification\u2014can be found in scientific hypotheses as well.\nIn a more complete statement: \u201cThe difference between art and\nscience is not that between feeling and fact, intuition and inference,\ndelight and deliberation, synthesis and analysis, sensation and\ncerebration, concreteness and abstraction, passion and action, mediacy\nand immediacy, or truth and beauty, but rather a difference in\ndomination of certain specific characteristics of symbols\u201d\n(Goodman 1976, 264).\n\nGoodman links artistic status to the performance of certain symbolic\nfunctions in certain ways. Yet, his emphasis on the importance of\nasking when art is rather than what art is should be\nseen as anti-essentialist claim with respect to art: there is no one\nproperty or set of properties, not even a function or set of\nfunctions, that are distinctive of art objects. On the other hand,\nthat emphasis should not be taken to suggest that artworks can slip in\nand out of artistic status just on the grounds of use. Certainly,\nGoodman is committed to claiming that something can be a work of art\nat one time and not another (1978a, 67). Yet, he also emphasizes how\nartistic status is somewhat permanent: \u201cThe Rembrandt painting\nremains a work of art, as it remains a painting, while functioning\nonly as a blanket\u201d (1978a, 69).\n\nGoodman\u2019s positive claims with respect to the experience of art\nare certainly to be taken seriously, in spite of the fact that the\nnegative claims preceding them, once read in light of the later\ndevelopments and applications of cognitive science to art, may sound\ntoo quickly dismissive. Goodman emphasizes the cognitive role\nof emotions in the apprehension of a work of art (1976, 248). In art,\nhe emphasizes, feeling emotions, whether positive or negative,\npleasant or unpleasant, is a way to perceive the work and the world\nthrough the work. Feeling melancholy when listening to a piece of\nmusic, for instance, may be a way to perceive musical features of the\nwork, as well as to perceive the world in terms of them. Hence, the\nemotions serve the understanding. On the other hand, such claims as,\nfor instance, that the view according to which \u201cart is concerned\nwith simulated emotions suggests, as does the copy theory of\nrepresentation, that art is a poor substitute for reality\u201d\n(1976, 246) are, in light of more recent developments, in tension with\nother claims by Goodman, such as that the \u201cactor or\ndancer\u2014or the spectator\u2014sometimes notes and remembers the\nfeeling of a movement rather than its pattern, insofar as the two can\nbe distinguished at all\u201d (1976, 248). For the sort of phenomena\nmentioned in the latter claim may very well be best explained by\ncognitive theories that consider mental simulation and other forms of\nmimicry central to certain imaginative activities as well as to\nmemory.\n\nArt has a general importance to the knowledge enterprise, which is\naddressed with special clarity in Ways of Worldmaking. A\nprimary thesis in that work \u201cis that the arts must be taken no\nless seriously than the sciences as modes of discovery, creation, and\nenlargement of knowledge in the broad sense of advancement of the\nunderstanding, and thus that the philosophy of art should be conceived\nas an integral part of metaphysics and epistemology\u201d (1978a,\n102). A more general thesis of the book is that the multiple and\ncompeting \u201cversions\u201d of the world that humankind\nmakes\u2014through scientific theories (claiming, e.g., that the Sun\nis the center of the universe, or claiming that the Earth is) but also\nthrough mythology, art, philosophy, and so on and so\nforth\u2014literally make worlds; they\n\u201cfabricate\u201d what we call \u201cfacts.\u201d And there\nisn\u2019t just one, all-embracing version of the world:\nmultiple and incompatible versions are possible. That is, Goodman is a\nconstructivist and a relativist. His relativism, however, is not one\nof laissez-faire: versions can be distinguished between right and\nwrong, and indeed attempts to construct a world may fail. For the\nworlds that Goodman posits are not possible worlds brought about by\npossible descriptions of the world. Rather, when the versions are\nright, they are all part of the actual world.\n\nFor such metaphysical and epistemological approach to include the arts\namongst the means to construct worlds, one needs only to add that\nversions of the world include non-verbal versions and non-literal\nversions as well. Art forms that do not use language, such as painting\nor music or architecture, can offer ways of perceiving and\nunderstanding the world\u2014indeed ways to construct a\nworld\u2014allowing us, for instance, to see and hear and perceive\nthings in new and refreshing ways. Works of art can participate in\nworldmaking precisely because they have symbolic functions (1978a,\n102). As linguistic labels categorize the world (and new, unusual\nlabels as \u201cgrue\u201d and \u201cbleen\u201d categorize it\ndifferently), so do pictorial labels, for instance, categorize it in a\nnumber of ways (and some of them indeed in new ways). Visiting a\nmuseum can change our perception of the world, making us notice new\naspects of reality and allowing us to encounter a different reality.\nLiteral denotation, metaphorical denotation, as well as\nexemplification and expression, can all contribute to the construction\nof a world. Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote literally denotes\nno one, yet metaphorically it denotes many of us. And artworks, by\nexemplifying shapes, colors, emotional patterns, etc., as well as by\nexpressing what they literally do not possess, can bring about a\nreorganization of the world of ordinary experience. This is not just\ntrue in the sense that seeing a painting may change our way of seeing\nthe world.
