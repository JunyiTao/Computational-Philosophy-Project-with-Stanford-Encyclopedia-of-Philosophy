    "main_text": "Fundamental Concepts || The Mirror Stage, the Ego, and the Subject\n2.2 The Mirror Stage, the Ego, and the Subject\n\nThe account of the mirror stage is perhaps Lacan\u2019s most famous\ntheoretical contribution (maybe even more famous than the well-known\nthesis apropos the unconscious as \u201cstructured like a\nlanguage\u201d). Initially developed in the 1930s, this account\ninvolves a number of interrelated ingredients. Lacan offers the\nnarrative of this stage as an explanation specifically for the genesis\nand functions of the Freudian psychical agency of the ego\n(Ich, moi). One of the psychoanalytic and\nphilosophical upshots of the mirror stage, a crucial one in\nLacan\u2019s eyes, is that the ego is an object rather than a\nsubject. In other words, the ego, despite conscious senses to the\ncontrary, is not a locus of autonomous agency, the seat of a free,\ntrue \u201cI\u201d determining its own fate. This portrait of the\nego-as-object is at the heart of Lacan\u2019s lifelong critical\npolemics against Anglo-American ego psychology, with the ego\npsychologists seeking to strengthen their patients\u2019 egos by\nappealing to supposed autonomous and \u201cconflict-free\u201d sides\nof these psychical agencies. Against this, Lacan views the ego as\nthoroughly compromised and inherently neurotic to its very core, as a\npassionate defense of a constitutive ignorance of the unconscious.\n\nTo stay at this more general metapsychological level for a little\nwhile longer, Lacan eventually forges, partly on the basis of the\nmirror stage, a distinction between the ego (moi) and the\nsubject (sujet, a word freighted with philosophical\nbaggage\u2014Lacan knowingly adds this word and its philosophical\nvocabulary to analytic discourse, although Freud did not speak of\n\u201cthe subject\u201d and was wary of philosophy). Appearances\nnotwithstanding, the ego is, when all is said and done, an inert,\nfixed bundle of objectified coordinates, a libidinally invested and\nreified entity. By contrast with the ego and the illusory sense of\nfictional selfhood it supports, the psychoanalytic subject of\nLacanianism is an unconscious kinetic negativity defying capture by\nand within ego-level identificatory constructs. The Lacanian\nenunciating subject of the unconscious speaks through the ego while\nremaining irreducibly distinct from it.\n\nReturning to a tighter focus on the mirror stage proper, Lacan,\nrelying on empirical data from the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth\ncenturies, posits that very young children, between the ages of six\nand eighteen months, quickly acquire the ability to identify their own\nimages in reflective surfaces. At this time, infants are lacking in\nmost physical and mental abilities possessed by older human beings.\nPrior to Lacan, Freud already highlights how a biologically dictated\nprematurational helplessness (Hilflosigkeit) naturally\npredestines the human being to the predominance of social nurture over\nmaterial nature due to the protracted period of total reliance on\nother persons for one\u2019s life-or-death vital requirements.\nFollowing Freud here, Lacan fleshes out this helplessness into which\nbirth throws neonates, describing in detail the anatomical,\nphysiological, cognitive, emotional, and motivational facets of this\nnatural condition of post-birth prematurity.\n\nThis initial state of helpless \u201cmotor impotence and nursling\ndependence\u201d entails the infant experiencing a swirl of negative\naffects: anxiety, distress, frustration, and so on. To the young\nchild, motivated by these negative affects, a crucial component of the\nenthralling lure exerted by the fascinating image of his/her body is\nthis image\u2019s promise that he/she can overcome his/her\nHilflosigkeit and be a unified, pulled-together whole, an\nintegrated, coordinated totality like the bigger, more mature others\nhe/she sees around him/her-self (however, according to Lacan,\nindividuals spend their entire lives, beginning thusly, chasing in\nvain after an unattainable state of harmony and mastery first falsely\npromised by the mirror). This imago-Gestalt of virtual\nwholeness, identified with by the infant in a jubilant moment of\n\u201cAha!,\u201d lays down the imagistic nucleus of the thereafter\nontogenetically accreting ego as a series of self-objectifications in\nimages and, soon after with the event of language acquisition, words\ntoo.\n\nFor Lacan, identification with the imago-Gestalt of the\nmoi entails alienation\u2014and this for additional reasons\nover and above those given in the preceding paragraphs. Already in the\n1949 \u00e9crit on the mirror stage, mention is made of\n\u201csome prop, human or artificial\u201d supporting the infant as\nhe/she gazes into the mirror and looks at him/her-self. In 1949, Lacan\nseems to think of this prop more as artificial than human, referring\nto the \u201ctrotte-b\u00e9b\u00e9\u201d (walker)\nleaned on by the child. But, in subsequent revisitations of the mirror\nstage during the 1960s, Lacan dramatically highlights the supporting\nrole of fellow human beings instead. In so doing, he argues that the\ninfant is encouraged to identify with the mirror image as\n\u201cme\u201d by verbal and gestural prompts issuing from the\nbigger other(s) holding him/her up in front of the reflective surface\n(for example, the utterance \u201cThat\u2019s you there!\u201d\naccompanied by pointing and grinning). This later shift of emphasis\nhas two crucial consequences. First, the Imaginary register of the\nmirror does not precede the Symbolic register of language and\nsociality in a linear chronology of developmental stages (as the\nearlier text of \u201cThe Mirror Stage\u201d might be at risk of\nsuggesting); if anything, socio-linguistic variables (for instance,\nthe words and body language of parents) are the causal triggers of the\nchild\u2019s investment in select sensory-perceptual experiences\n(such as the body image in the mirror). Second, this means that the\nimagistic nucleus of the ego is suffused from the get-go with the\ndestinal \u201cdiscourse of the Other\u201d\u2014in this case,\nfateful significations (in Lacanese, \u201cunary traits\u201d)\ncoming from caregivers\u2019 narratives articulated simultaneously\nalong with their encouragements to the child to recognize him/her-self\nin the mirror (\u201cWhat a handsome boy!,\u201d \u201cWhat a\nbeautiful girl!,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to grow up to be big\nand strong, just like your daddy,\u201d etc.).\n\nAs a result of all of the above, Lacan considers the recognition that\nhappens in the mirror stage to amount to \u201cmisrecognition\u201d\n(m\u00e9connaissance). This likewise holds throughout life\nfor all ensuing experiences of \u201crecognizing\u201d oneself as\nbeing a particular kind of \u201cI,\u201d namely, taking\nqua imagining oneself to be a certain sort of ego-level self\n(apropos Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis, it always pays to remember\nWilliam Wordsworth\u2019s line, \u201cThe child is the father of the\nman\u201d). The ego is not only a congealed, heteronomous object\nrather than fluid, autonomous subject, but also, in its very origins,\na repository for the projected desires and fantasies of larger others;\nthe child\u2019s image is a receptacle for his/her parents\u2019\ndreams and wishes, with his/her body image being always-already\noverwritten by signifiers flowing from the libidinal economies of\nother speaking beings. Hence, recognizing the ego as \u201cme,\u201d\nas embodying and representing an authentic, private, unique selfhood\nthat is most genuinely my own, is tantamount to misrecognizing that,\nat root, the ego ultimately is an alienating foreign introject through\nwhich I am seduced and subjected by others\u2019 conscious and\nunconscious wants and machinations. To borrow one of Lacan\u2019s\nmany neologisms, the ego ultimately is something\n\u201cextimate\u201d (i.e., intimately exterior, an internal\nexternality) insofar as it crystallizes \u201cthe desire of the\nOther\u201d (qua others\u2019 conscious and unconscious\nwants and machinations). Or, as the Lacan of the eleventh seminar\nwould put it, there is something in the me more than the me itself to\nthe extent that this moi essentially is a coagulation of\ninter-subjective and trans-subjective alien influences.\n\nFinally, Lacan\u2019s utilization of the idea of the mirror is not\nexclusively literal. Although he often talks of mirrors as shiny\nreflective surfaces, he does not limit mirroring to being a visible\nphysical phenomenon alone. Most importantly, other persons\u2019\nspeech, gestures, postures, moods, facial expressions, and so on\nfrequently can be said to \u201cmirror\u201d back to one an\n\u201cimage\u201d of oneself, namely, a conveyed sense of how one\n\u201cappears\u201d from other perspectives.\n",
