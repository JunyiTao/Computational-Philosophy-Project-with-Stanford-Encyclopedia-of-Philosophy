    "main_text": "The impact of information technology on privacy || The Internet of Things\n2.6 The Internet of Things\n\nDevices connected to the Internet are not limited to user-owned\ncomputing devices like smartphones. Many devices contain chips and/or\nare connected in the so-called Internet of Things. RFID (radio\nfrequency identification) chips can be read from a limited distance,\nsuch that you can hold them in front of a reader rather than inserting\nthem. EU and US passports have RFID chips with protected biometric\ndata, but information like the user\u2019s nationality may easily leak when\nattempting to read such devices (see Richter, Mostowski & Poll\n2008, in Other Internet Resources). \u201cSmart\u201d RFIDs are also\nembedded in public transport payment systems. \u201cDumb\u201d\nRFIDs, basically only containing a number, appear in many kinds of\nproducts as a replacement of the barcode, and for use in logistics.\nStill, such chips could be used to trace a person once it is known\nthat he carries an item containing a chip.\n\nIn the home, there are smart meters for automatically reading and\nsending electricity and water consumption, and thermostats and other devices\nthat can be remotely controlled by the owner. Such devices again\ngenerate statistics, and these can be used for mining and profiling.\nIn the future, more and more household appliances will be connected,\neach generating its own information. Ambient intelligence (Brey 2005),\nand ubiquitous computing, along with the Internet of Things\n(Friedewald & Raabe 2011), also enable automatic adaptation of the\nenvironment to the user, based on explicit preferences and implicit\nobservations, and user autonomy is a central theme in considering the\nprivacy implications of such devices. In general, the move towards a\nservice-oriented provisioning of goods, with suppliers being informed\nabout how the products are used through IT and associated\nconnectivity, requires consideration of the associated privacy and\ntransparency concerns (Pieters 2013). For example, users will need to\nbe informed when connected devices contain a microphone and how and\nwhen it is used.\n2.7 E-Government\n\nGovernment and public administration have undergone radical\ntransformations as a result of the availability of advanced IT systems\nas well. Examples of these changes are biometric passports, online\ne-government services, voting systems, a variety of online citizen\nparticipation tools and platforms or online access to recordings of\nsessions of parliament and government committee meetings. \n\nConsider the case of voting in elections. Information technology may\nplay a role in different phases in the voting process, which may have\ndifferent impact on voter privacy. Most countries have a requirement\nthat elections are to be held by secret ballot, to prevent vote buying\nand coercion. In this case, the voter is supposed to keep her vote\nprivate, even if she would want to reveal it. For information\ntechnology used for casting votes, this is defined as the requirement\nof receipt-freeness or coercion-resistance (Delaune, Kremer & Ryan\n2006). In polling stations, the authorities see to it that the voter\nkeeps the vote private, but such surveillance is not possible when\nvoting by mail or online, and it cannot even be enforced by\ntechnological means, as someone can always watch while the voter\nvotes. In this case, privacy is not only a right but also a duty, and\ninformation technology developments play an important role in the\npossibilities of the voter to fulfill this duty, as well as the\npossibilities of the authorities to verify this. In a broader sense,\ne-democracy initiatives may change the way privacy is viewed in the\npolitical process.\n\nMore generally, privacy is important in democracy to prevent undue\ninfluence. While lack of privacy in the voting process could enable\nvote buying and coercion, there are more subtle ways of influencing\nthe democratic process, for example through targeted (mis)information\ncampaigns. Online (political) activities of citizens on for example\nsocial media facilitate such attempts because of the possibility of\ntargeting through behavioural profiling. Compared to offline political\nactivities, it is more difficult to hide preferences and activities,\nbreaches of confidentiality are more likely, and attempts to influence\nopinions become more scalable.\n2.8 Surveillance\n\nInformation technology is used for all kinds of surveillance tasks. It\ncan be used to augment and extend traditional surveillance systems\nsuch as CCTV and other camera systems, for example to identify\nspecific individuals in crowds, using face recognition techniques, or\nto monitor specific places for unwanted behaviour. Such approaches\nbecome even more powerful when combined with other techniques, such as\nmonitoring of Internet-of-Things devices (Motlagh et al. 2017).\n\nBesides augmenting existing surveillance systems, ICT techniques are\nnowadays mainly used in the digital domain, typically grouped together\nunder the term \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d (Zuboff 2019). Social\nmedia and other online systems are used to gather large amounts of\ndata about individuals \u2013 either \u201cvoluntary\u201d, because users\nsubscribe to a specific service (Google, Facebook), or involuntary by\ngathering all kinds of user related data in a less transparent manner.\nData analysis and machine learning techniques are then used to\ngenerate prediction models of individual users that can be used, for\nexample, for targeted advertisement, but also for more malicious\nintents such as fraud or micro-targeting to influence elections\n(Albright 2016, Other Internet Resources) or referenda such as Brexit\n(Cadwalladr 2019, Other Internet Resources).\n\nIn addition to the private sector surveillance industry, governments\nform another traditional group that uses surveillance techniques at a\nlarge scale, either by intelligence services or law enforcement. These\ntypes of surveillance systems are typically justified with an appeal\nto the \u201cgreater good\u201d and protecting citizens, but their\nuse is also controversial. For such systems, one would typically like\nto ensure that any negative effects on privacy are proportional to the\nbenefits achieved by the technology. Especially since these systems\nare typically shrouded in secrecy, it is difficult for outsiders to\nsee if such systems are used proportionally, or indeed useful for\ntheir tasks (Lawner 2002). This is particularly pressing when\ngovernments use private sector data or services for surveillance\npurposes. \nThe almost universal use of good encryption techniques\nin communication systems makes it also harder to gather effective\nsurveillance information, leading to more and more calls for \u201cback\ndoors\u201d that can exclusively be used by government in communication\nsystems. From a privacy standpoint this could be evaluated as\nunwanted, not only because it gives governments access to private\nconversations, but also because it lowers the overall security of\ncommunication systems that employ this technique (Abelson et al.\n2015).\n3. How can information technology itself solve privacy concerns?\n\nWhereas information technology is typically seen as the cause\nof privacy problems, there are also several ways in which information\ntechnology can help to solve these problems. There are rules,\nguidelines or best practices that can be used for designing\nprivacy-preserving systems. Such possibilities range from\nethically-informed design methodologies to using encryption to protect\npersonal information from unauthorized use. In particular, methods\nfrom the field of information security, aimed at protecting\ninformation against unauthorized access, can play a key role in the\nprotection of personal data.\n3.1 Design methods\n\nValue sensitive design provides a \u201ctheoretically grounded\napproach to the design of technology that accounts for human values in\na principled and comprehensive manner throughout the design\nprocess\u201d (Friedman et al. 2006). It provides a set of rules and\nguidelines for designing a system with a certain value in mind. One\nsuch value can be \u2018privacy\u2019, and value sensitive design\ncan thus be used as a method to design privacy-friendly IT systems\n(Van den Hoven et al. 2015).  The \u2018privacy by design\u2019\napproach as advocated by Cavoukian (2009) and others can be regarded\nas one of the value sensitive design approaches that specifically\nfocuses on privacy (Warnier et al. 2015). More recently, approaches\nsuch as \u201cprivacy engineering\u201d (Ceross & Simpson 2018)\nextend the privacy by design approach by aiming to provide a more\npractical, deployable set of methods by which to achieve system-wide\nprivacy.\n\nThe privacy by design approach provides high-level guidelines in the\nform of principles for designing privacy-preserving systems.\nThese principles have at their core that \u201cdata protection needs\nto be viewed in proactive rather than reactive terms, making privacy\nby design preventive and not simply remedial\u201d (Cavoukian 2010).\nPrivacy by design\u2019s main point is that data protection should be\ncentral in all phases of product life cycles, from initial design to\noperational use and disposal (see Colesky et al. 2016) for a critical\nanalysis of the privacy by design approach). The Privacy Impact\nAssessment approach proposed by Clarke (2009) makes a similar point.\nIt proposes \u201ca systematic process for evaluating the potential\neffects on privacy of a project, initiative or proposed system or\nscheme\u201d (Clarke 2009). Note that these approaches should not\nonly be seen as auditing approaches, but rather as a means to make\nprivacy awareness and compliance an integral part of the\norganizational and engineering culture.\n\nThere are also several industry guidelines that can be used to design\nprivacy preserving IT systems. The Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard (see PCI DSS v3.2, 2018, in the Other Internet Resources),\nfor example, gives very clear guidelines for privacy and security\nsensitive systems design in the domain of the credit card industry and\nits partners (retailers, banks). Various International Organization\nfor Standardization (ISO) standards (Hone & Eloff 2002) also serve\nas a source of best practices and guidelines, especially with respect\nto information security, for the design of privacy friendly systems.\nFurthermore, the principles that are formed by the EU Data Protection\nDirective, which are themselves based on the Fair Information\nPractices (Gellman 2014) from the early 70s \u2013 transparency,\npurpose, proportionality, access, transfer \u2013 are technologically\nneutral and as such can also be considered as high level \u2018design\nprinciples\u2019. Systems that are designed with these rules and\nguidelines in mind should thus \u2013 in principle \u2013 be in\ncompliance with EU privacy laws and respect the privacy of its\nusers.\n\nThe rules and principles described above give high-level guidance for\ndesigning privacy-preserving systems, but this does not mean that if\nthese methodologies are followed the resulting IT system will\n(automatically) be privacy friendly. Some design principles are rather\nvague and abstract. What does it mean to make a transparent design or\nto design for proportionality? The principles need to be interpreted\nand placed in a context when designing a specific system. But\ndifferent people will interpret the principles differently, which will\nlead to different design choices, with different effects on privacy.\nThere is also a difference between the design and the implementation\nof a computer system. During the implementation phase software bugs\nare introduced, some of which can be exploited to break the system and\nextract private information. How to implement bug-free computer\nsystems remains an open research question (Hoare 2003). In addition,\nimplementation is another phase wherein choices and interpretations\nare made: system designs can be implemented in infinitely many ways.\nMoreover, it is very hard to verify \u2013 for anything beyond\nnon-trivial systems \u2013 whether an implementation meets its\ndesign/specification (Loeckx, Sieber, & Stansifer 1985). This is\neven more difficult for non-functional requirements such as\n\u2018being privacy preserving\u2019 or security properties in\ngeneral. \n\nSome specific solutions to privacy problems aim at increasing the\nlevel of awareness and consent of the user. These solutions can be\nseen as an attempt to apply the notion of informed consent to privacy\nissues with technology (Custers et al. 2018). This is connected to the\nidea that privacy settings and policies should be explainable to users\n(Pieters 2011). For example, the Privacy Coach supports customers in\nmaking privacy decisions when confronted with RFID tags (Broenink et\nal. 2010). However, users have only a limited capability of dealing\nwith such choices, and providing too many choices may easily lead to\nthe problem of moral overload (van den Hoven, Lokhorst, & Van de\nPoel 2012). A technical solution is support for automatic matching of\na privacy policy set by the user against policies issued by web sites\nor apps.\n3.2 Privacy enhancing technologies\n\nA growing number of software tools are available that provide some\nform of privacy (usually anonymity) for their users, such tools are\ncommonly known as privacy enhancing technologies (Danezis &\nG\u00fcrses 2010, Other Internet Resources). Examples include\ncommunication-anonymizing tools such as Tor (Dingledine, Mathewson,\n& Syverson 2004) and Freenet (Clarke et al. 2001), and\nidentity-management systems for which many commercial software\npackages exist (see below). Communication anonymizing tools allow\nusers to anonymously browse the web (with Tor) or anonymously share\ncontent (Freenet). They employ a number of cryptographic techniques\nand security protocols in order to ensure their goal of anonymous\ncommunication. Both systems use the property that numerous users use\nthe system at the same time which provides k-anonymity (Sweeney\n2002): no individual can be uniquely distinguished from a group of\nsize k, for large values for k. Depending on the system,\nthe value of k can vary between a few hundred to hundreds of\nthousands. In Tor, messages are encrypted and routed along numerous\ndifferent computers, thereby obscuring the original sender of the\nmessage (and thus providing anonymity). Similarly, in Freenet content\nis stored in encrypted form from all users of the system. Since users\nthemselves do not have the necessary decryption keys, they do not know\nwhat kind of content is stored, by the system, on their own computer.\nThis provides plausible deniability and privacy. The system can at any\ntime retrieve the encrypted content and send it to different Freenet\nusers.\n\nPrivacy enhancing technologies also have their downsides. For example,\nTor, the tool that allows anonymized communication and browsing over\nthe Internet, is susceptible to an attack whereby, under certain\ncircumstances, the anonymity of the user is no longer guaranteed\n(Back, M\u00f6ller, & Stiglic 2001; Evans, Dingledine, &\nGrothoff 2009). Freenet (and other tools) have similar problems\n(Douceur 2002). Note that for such attacks to work, an attacker needs\nto have access to large resources that in practice are only realistic\nfor intelligence agencies of countries. However, there are other\nrisks. Configuring such software tools correctly is difficult for the\naverage user, and when the tools are not correctly configured\nanonymity of the user is no longer guaranteed. And there is always the\nrisk that the computer on which the privacy-preserving software runs\nis infected by a Trojan horse (or other digital pest) that monitors\nall communication and knows the identity of the user.\n\nAnother option for providing anonymity is the anonymization of data\nthrough special software. Tools exist that remove patient names and\nreduce age information to intervals: the age 35 is then represented as\nfalling in the range 30\u201340. The idea behind such anonymization\nsoftware is that a record can no longer be linked to an individual,\nwhile the relevant parts of the data can still be used for scientific\nor other purposes. The problem here is that it is very hard to\nanonymize data in such a way that all links with an individual are\nremoved and the resulting anonymized data is still useful for research\npurposes. Researchers have shown that it is almost always possible to\nreconstruct links with individuals by using sophisticated statistical\nmethods (Danezis, Diaz, & Troncoso 2007) and by combining multiple\ndatabases (Anderson 2008) that contain personal information.\nTechniques such as k-anonymity might also help to generalize\nthe data enough to make it unfeasible to de-anonymize data (LeFevre et\nal. 2005).\n3.3 Cryptography\n\nCryptography has long been used as a means to protect data, dating\nback to the Caesar cipher more than two thousand years ago. Modern\ncryptographic techniques are essential in any IT system that needs to\nstore (and thus protect) personal data, for example by providing\nsecure (confidential) connections for browsing (HTTPS) and networking\n(VPN). Note however that by itself cryptography does not provide any\nprotection against data breaching; only when applied correctly in a\nspecific context does it become a \u2018fence\u2019 around personal\ndata. In addition, cryptographic schemes that become outdated by\nfaster computers or new attacks may pose threats to (long-term)\nprivacy.\nCryptography is a large\nfield, so any description here will be incomplete. The focus will be\ninstead on some newer cryptographic techniques, in particular\nhomomorphic encryption, that have the potential to become very\nimportant for processing and searching in personal data.\n\nVarious techniques exist for searching through encrypted data (Song et\nal. 2000, Wang et al. 2016), which provides a form of privacy\nprotection (the data is encrypted) and selective access to sensitive\ndata. One relatively new technique that can be used for designing\nprivacy-preserving systems is \u2018homomorphic encryption\u2019\n(Gentry 2009, Acar et al. 2018). Homomorphic encryption allows a data\nprocessor to process encrypted data, i.e. users could send personal\ndata in encrypted form and get back some useful results \u2013 for\nexample, recommendations of movies that online friends like \u2013 in\nencrypted form. The original user can then again decrypt the result\nand use it without revealing any personal data to the data processor.\nHomomorphic encryption, for example, could be used to aggregate\nencrypted data thereby allowing both privacy protection and useful\n(anonymized) aggregate information. The technique is currently not\nwidely applied; there are serious performance issues if one wants to\napply full homomorphic encryption to the large amounts of data stored\nin today\u2019s systems. However, variants of the original homomorphic\nencryption scheme are emerging, such as Somewhat Homomorphic\nEncryption (Badawi et al. 2018), that are showing promise to be more\nwidely applied in practice.\n\nThe main idea behind blockchain technology was first described in the\nseminal paper on Bitcoins (Nakamoto, n.d., Other Internet Resources).\nA blockchain is basically a distributed ledger that stores\ntransactions in a non-reputable way, without the use of a trusted\nthird party. Cryptography is used to ensure that all transactions are\n\u201capproved\u201d by members of the blockchain and stored in such a way\nthat they are linked to previous transactions and cannot be removed.\nAlthough focused on data integrity and not inherently anonymous,\nblockchain technology enables many privacy-related applications\n(Yli-Huumo et al. 2016, Karame and Capkun 2018), such as anonymous\ncryptocurrency (Narayanan et al. 2016) and self-sovereign identity\n(see below).\n3.4 Identity management\n\nThe use and management of user\u2019s online identifiers are crucial in the\ncurrent Internet and social networks. Online reputations become more\nand more important, both for users and for companies. In the era of\nbig data correct information about users has an\nincreasing monetary value.\n\n\u2018Single sign on\u2019 frameworks, provided by independent third\nparties (OpenID) but also by large companies such as Facebook,\nMicrosoft and Google (Ko et al. 2010), make it easy for users to\nconnect to numerous online services using a single online identity.\nThese online identities are usually directly linked to the real world\n(off line) identities of individuals; indeed Facebook, Google and\nothers require this form of log on (den Haak 2012). Requiring a direct\nlink between online and \u2018real world\u2019 identities is\nproblematic from a privacy perspective, because they allow profiling\nof users (Benevenuto et al. 2012). Not all users will realize how\nlarge the amount of data is that companies gather in this manner, or\nhow easy it is to build a detailed profile of users. Profiling becomes\neven easier if the profile information is combined with other\ntechniques such as implicit authentication via cookies and tracking\ncookies (Mayer & Mitchell 2012).\n\nFrom a privacy perspective a better solution would be the use of\nattribute-based authentication (Goyal et al. 2006) which allows access\nof online services based on the attributes of users, for example their\nfriends, nationality, age etc. Depending on the attributes used, they\nmight still be traced back to specific individuals, but this is no\nlonger crucial. In addition, users can no longer be tracked to\ndifferent services because they can use different attributes to access\ndifferent services which makes it difficult to trace online identities\nover multiple transactions, thus providing unlinkability for the user.\nRecently (Allen 2016, Other Internet Resources), the concept of\nself-sovereign identity has emerged, which aims for users to have\ncomplete ownership and control about their own digital identities.\nBlockchain technology is used to make it possible for users to control\na digital identity without the use of a traditional trusted third\nparty (Baars 2016).\n4. Emerging technologies and our understanding of privacy\n\nIn the previous sections, we have outlined how current technologies\nmay impact privacy, as well as how they may contribute to mitigating\nundesirable effects. However, there are future and emerging\ntechnologies that may have an even more profound impact. Consider for\nexample brain-computer interfaces. In case computers are connected\ndirectly to the brain, not only behavioral characteristics are subject\nto privacy considerations, but even one\u2019s thoughts run the risk of\nbecoming public, with decisions of others being based upon them. In\naddition, it could become possible to change one\u2019s behavior by means\nof such technology. Such developments therefore require further\nconsideration of the reasons for protecting privacy. In particular,\nwhen brain processes could be influenced from the outside, autonomy\nwould be a value to reconsider to ensure adequate protection.\n\nApart from evaluating information technology against current moral\nnorms, one also needs to consider the possibility that technological\nchanges influence the norms themselves (Boenink, Swierstra &\nStemerding 2010). Technology thus does not only influence privacy by\nchanging the accessibility of information, but also by changing the\nprivacy norms themselves. For example, social networking sites invite\nusers to share more information than they otherwise might. This\n\u201coversharing\u201d becomes accepted practice within certain\ngroups. With future and emerging technologies, such influences can\nalso be expected and therefore they ought to be taken into account\nwhen trying to mitigate effects.\n\nAnother fundamental question is whether, given the future (and even\ncurrent) level of informational connectivity, it is feasible to\nprotect privacy by trying to hide information from parties who may use\nit in undesirable ways. Gutwirth & De Hert (2008) argue that it\nmay be more feasible to protect privacy by transparency \u2013 by\nrequiring actors to justify decisions made about individuals, thus\ninsisting that decisions are not based on illegitimate information.\nThis approach comes with its own problems, as it might be hard to\nprove that the wrong information was used for a decision. Still, it\nmay well happen that citizens, in turn, start data collection on those\nwho collect data about them, e.g. governments. Such\n\u201ccounter(sur)veillance\u201d may be used to gather information\nabout the use of information, thereby improving accountability\n(G\u00fcrses et al. 2016). The open source movement may also\ncontribute to transparency of data processing. In this context,\ntransparency can be seen as a pro-ethical condition contributing to\nprivacy (Turilli & Floridi 2009).\n\nIt has been argued that the precautionary principle, well known in\nenvironmental ethics, might have a role in dealing with emerging\ninformation technologies as well (Pieters & van Cleeff 2009; Som,\nHilty & K\u00f6hler 2009). The principle would see to it that the\nburden of proof for absence of irreversible effects of information\ntechnology on society, e.g. in terms of power relations and equality,\nwould lie with those advocating the new technology. Precaution, in\nthis sense, could then be used to impose restrictions at a regulatory\nlevel, in combination with or as an alternative to empowering users,\nthereby potentially contributing to the prevention of informational\noverload on the user side. Apart from general debates about the\ndesirable and undesirable features of the precautionary principle,\nchallenges to it lie in its translation to social effects and social\nsustainability, as well as to its application to consequences induced\nby intentional actions of agents. Whereas the occurrence of natural\nthreats or accidents is probabilistic in nature, those who are\ninterested in improper use of information behave strategically,\nrequiring a different approach to risk (i.e. security as opposed to\nsafety). In addition, proponents of precaution will need to balance it\nwith other important principles, viz., of informed consent and\nautonomy.\n\nFinally, it is appropriate to note that not all social effects of\ninformation technology concern privacy (Pieters 2017). Examples\ninclude the effects of social network sites on friendship, and the\nverifiability of results of electronic elections. Therefore,\nvalue-sensitive design approaches and impact assessments of\ninformation technology should not focus on privacy only, since\ninformation technology affects many other values as well.",
