    "main_text": "Religion\n4. Other sophists\n\n\nAt Apology 19e\u201320c Plato represents Socrates as naming\nfour individuals who undertake to teach or educate people\n(paideuein anthr\u014dpous) in return for fees; they are\nGorgias (from Leontinoi in Sicily), Hippias (from Elis, in the\nnorth-western Peloponnese, Prodicus (from Ceos, off the southern tip\nof Attica) and Euenus (from Paros, in the southern Aegean). Of the\nfour only Euenus is expressly said to teach \u2018human and political\nexcellence\u2019 (t\u0113s \u2026 aret\u0113s \u2026\nanthr\u014dpin\u0113s te kai politik\u0113s, i.e., success in the\nrunning of one\u2019s life and in public affairs), but the context strongly\nsuggests that the other three are seen as offering the same kind of\ninstruction. Euenus is otherwise known chiefly as a poet (though Plato\nPhaedrus 267a mentions some contributions to rhetorical\ntheory), and his appearance in this context indicates the continuation\ninto the sophistic era of the older tradition of the poet as moral\nteacher (see above). If Gorgias is included in this context among the\nteachers of excellence, there is a difficulty in that at Meno\n95c Meno, a pupil of Gorgias, says that what he most admires about him\nis that not only does he never claim to teach excellence, but that he\nmakes fun of those who do. Consistently with that, in the dialogue\nnamed after him he begins by claiming that what he has to teach is not\nany system of values, but a technique of persuasion, which is in itself\nvalue-free, but is capable of being employed for whatever purposes,\ngood or bad, are adopted by the person who has mastered it, just as\nskill in martial arts can be used for good ends or bad (456a\u2013457c). But\nin fact the distinction is not so clear, since Gorgias is readily\ninduced to agree that a political orator has to know what is right and\nwrong, and that he (Gorgias) will teach his pupil those things if he\nhappens not to know them already (460a\u2013c). Perhaps it is assumed that\nnormally the pupil will know in advance what is right and wrong, so\nGorgias will not have to teach him that, and can concentrate on the\nessential skill of persuasion. But the point of learning to persuade\nwill be to gain power over others, and thereby to achieve personal and\npolitical success. So Gorgias will rightly be counted among the\nteachers of excellence; what is distinctive about his teaching is the\nprominence of persuasion in the achievement of excellence. But\npersuasion, though central, was not everything. At the opening of the\ndialogue (447d\u2013448a) Gorgias claims to be able to answer any question\nanyone puts to him, and says that for many years no-one has asked him\nanything new, which seems to mean \u2018asked me any question to which\nI didn\u2019t already know the answer\u2019 (see also Meno\n70b). Making this claim seems to commit him to the kind of encyclopedic\nknowledge which we find Hippias displaying (see below). His extant\nwritings include display speeches, purportedly in defence of Helen and\nPalamedes against charges of treachery (DK 82B11 and 11a); they seem to\nbe intended partly as examples of stylistic brilliance for its own sake\nand partly as demonstration of skill in adversarial argument,\n\u2018making the weaker argument the stronger\u2019 (see above). In\naddition, we have a philosophical essay \u2018On Non-Being or On\nNature\u2019 (DK 82B3), purporting to be a rebuttal of Parmenides, in\nwhich he maintains that nothing exists, that if anything did exist it\ncould not be known and that if anything could be known it could not be\ncommunicated. Scholarly opinion has been and remains divided as to\nwhether this was intended as a parody of Eleatic writing or as a\nserious piece of philosophy. What can definitely be said is that it\nshows some knowledge of Parmenides, that it at least raises serious\nphilosophical questions, such as the relation of thought to reality and\nthe possibility of referring to things which do not exist, that no\nquestion which it raises is developed to any significant extent and\nthat most of its arguments are extremely feeble. It reads like a piece\nwritten by a clever man with no real interest in philosophy, but it is\ndoubtful whether we shall ever know why he wrote it.\n\n\nHippias was above all a polymath. He first appears in the\nProtagoras (315c) sitting in a professorial chair giving\ndetailed answers to questions on science generally and astronomy in\nparticular, and later (318e) Protagoras in effect accuses him of\ndefrauding his pupils by making them study arithmetic, geometry,\nastronomy and mousik\u0113 (music and poetry) instead\nof concentrating on teaching excellence. In the Greater\nHippias (285b\u2013e) he describes how he lectured at Sparta on\ngenealogy and all aspects of ancient history, and he is variously\nreported as lecturing on painting and sculpture, as having developed a\nmnemonic technique which enabled him to repeat a list of fifty names\nafter a single hearing (both DK 86A2 (Philostratus)), and as appearing\nat the Olympic Games wearing and carrying nothing which he had not made\nhimself, down to his signet-ring (Lesser Hippias 368b). His\nwritings included a list of Olympic victors and a work entitled\nSynag\u014dg\u0113, \u2018Collection\u2019 or\n\u2018Miscellany\u2019, which seems to have been a compendium of\nmiscellaneous information collected from the poets and other sources,\nboth Greek and foreign (DK 86B6 (Clement)). At the Olympic Games he\ngave speeches on any subject anyone proposed, and like Gorgias,\nanswered any question anyone put to him (Lesser Hippias\n363c), and in the same dialogue (346a) he says that since he began\ncompeting (ag\u014dnizesthai) at the games he has never been\nbeaten. Presumably the competitions were eristic contests (see\nabove). Like Protagoras and Prodicus he taught the correct use of\nlanguage (Lesser Hippias 368d), and despite Protagoras\u2019\nstricture, he also offered the standard sophistic fare of poetic\nexegesis (Protagoras 347b, Lesser Hippias passim) and\nmoral and practical instruction (Greater Hippias  286a\u2013c). We\nsaw above that his moral and religious stance was conservative, and\nhis championing of phusis against\nnomos (see above) is rather an appeal to cosmopolitan elitism\nthan any kind of challenge to conventional morality. Perhaps more than\nany other single person he encapsulates the complexity of the sophistic\nphenomenon.\n\n\nProdicus\u2019 position on religion was discussed earlier. Apart\nfrom it he is best known for his insistence on the correct use of\nlanguage (Plato, Euthydemus 277e), in particular fine\ndiscriminations of the senses of near-synonyms, a topic in which he\nseems to have specialised. Plato gives numerous examples in the\nProtagoras (especially 337a\u2013c) and in other dialogues (for\ndetails see DK 84A13\u201318), and Socrates says (Cratylus 384b)\nthat he has attended Prodicus\u2019 \u2018one-drachma\u2019 lecture\non names, but was unfortunately unable to afford the full course, for\nwhich the fee was fifty drachmas (a drachma being a day\u2019s wage\nfor a skilled craftsman at this period). He is reported as having had\nsome interest in natural philosophy, including astronomy (DK 84AI\n(Suda), A5 (Aristophanes) and B3 (Galen)), and as having applied his\nlinguistic theory to medical terminology (DK 84B4 (Galen)). All that\nhas survived of his writings is a paraphrase by Xenophon\n(Memorabilia II.1.21\u201334) of his moral fable of the choice of\nHeracles between Virtue and Vice. In this story Heracles is approached\nat a cross-road by two female figures representing Virtue and Vice,\neach of whom tries to persuade him to follow her by describing the\nattractions of a life with her. Both base their appeal on pleasure,\nVice stressing the meretricious allurements of the voluptuous life,\nwhile Virtue offers the genuine and lasting pleasures of the life of\nhonesty and sobriety, including good reputation and the favor of the\ngods, an appeal which wins the day. In contrast to his radical views on\nreligion, the moral stance expressed here is thoroughly\nconventional. (Mayhew 2011 xiv-xvii gives a useful summary of the basics of Prodicus\u2019 treatment of language.)\n\nFor information on other sophists see Guthrie 1969, ch. 11, and (in\nGerman) Kerferd & Flashar 1998 (secs. 5, Thrasymachus; 8,\nAntiphon; and 11, minor sophists).\n\n\nThe major sophists were considerable celebrities, and were active in\npublic affairs. The Protagoras captures the excitement which\nthey engendered on arriving in a city, the cosmopolitan clientele who\naccompanied them and their associations with the rich and powerful.\nSome made a great deal of money; Hippias boasts (Greater\nHippias 282e) of making, in a single visit to Sicily, more\nthan a hundred and fifty minas, i.e., fifteen thousand drachmas,\nsomething in the region of thirty years\u2019 wages for a skilled\ncraftsman, and Socrates says (Meno 91d) that Protagoras earned\nmore than ten sculptors, including the celebrated Phidias. Protagoras\ndrew up the law-code for the foundation of the Athenian colony of\nThurii in 444/3 (Diogenes Laertius IX.50), and Gorgias, Hippias, Prodicus and\npossibly also Thrasymachus acted as diplomatic representatives of their\nrespective cities. But their wealth and celebrity status has to be set\nagainst the negative reaction they aroused in those of conservative\nviews, e.g. Anytus in Meno 89e\u201394e, who saw them (to\na considerable extent unfairly, as we have seen) as subversive of\nmorality and religion and a bad influence on the young. According to\nPlato in the Apology, it was that climate of opinion, most\nstrikingly expressed in Aristophanes\u2019 Clouds, which had\nled eventually to the condemnation of Socrates on grounds of irreligion\nand the corruption of the young. Consequently, his rehabilitation of\nSocrates leads him to contrast the genuine philosopher with the\nsophists, whom he depicts predominantly as charlatans. That hostile\nportrait was the historical foundation of the conception of the sophist\nas a dishonest argumentative trickster, a conception which remains the\nprimary sense of the word in modern usage, but which considerably\ndistorts what can be recovered of the historical reality.\n",
