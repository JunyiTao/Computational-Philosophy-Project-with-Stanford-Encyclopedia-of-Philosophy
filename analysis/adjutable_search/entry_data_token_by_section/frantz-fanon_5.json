    "main_text": "The Case Studies\n6. Legacy and Influence\n\nWe could say that, in many ways, Fanon\u2019s legacy and influence\noutsizes his modest output as a writer. Fanon wrote for about a\ndecade, which, in any comparison with other major thinkers, is almost\nno time at all. The pages produced, as well, are modest. Black\nSkin, White Masks and The Wretched of the Earth are\nsubstantial books composed of original chapters and analysis, but the\nother two works A Dying Colonialism (1959) and Toward the\nAfrican Revolution (posthumously published in 1964) are comprised\nof short essays, preliminary analyses, and occasional pieces. While\nthose shorter, preliminary, and occasional works are fascinating and\nimportant, they are a portrait of a thinker in motion, a thinker whose\ncommitment to diverse and unfolding revolutionary\nsites required both quick takes and patient contemplation. Fanon moved\nvery quickly through the Algerian struggle and did not hesitate to be\ndeclarative, and his work on black Africa is very much the same,\nalbeit without the same concrete engagement and intellectual\nbackground. Yet, Fanon is also patient and reflective, something we\nsee in the psychiatric studies that simultaneously underpin his\nbroader analyses and suggest other productive avenues for thought.\n\nIn other words, looking back six-plus decades later, we can see\nFanon\u2019s oeuvre as composed of profound, enduring insights and a\nbody of un- and under-developed work. This mixed legacy in the written\nwork has not limited Fanon\u2019s enormous influence. He was, in his\ntime and certainly in the decades following his death, a hero to and\nintellectual inspiration for anti-colonial and anti-racist struggle,\ninforming the work of thinkers from all over the global South. Latin\nAmerican militants drew on Fanon\u2019s insights, as did so many on\nthe continent of Africa and across South Asia. His impact on cultural\nstudies is also sizable. Fanonian concepts inform countless\ndiscussions of race, nation, migration, language, representation,\nvisuality, and so on. This is largely due to Fanon\u2019s unique\nability to engage across theoretical approaches and, in those\napproaches, infuse analysis with rich phenomenological descriptions of\nthe body and psyche under colonial domination. Reiland Rabaka\u2019s\nForms of Fanonism (2011) is especially interesting here for\nits careful work to reinscribe these kinds of analysis into the Black\nradical tradition more broadly.\n\nThe recent publication and translation into English of Fanon\u2019s\nunpublished works, which range from letters to a draft of a play, will\nsurely open up new dimensions of commentary. One of the signature\nfeatures of Fanon-commentary is the creativity of the interlocutors\nwho, if not doing lineage of influence textual study, have worked to\ninterpret and extend Fanon\u2019s ideas. Indeed, this is one of the\nmore interesting features of Fanon scholarship, something Henry Louis\nGates, Jr. famously described as Fanon\u2019s function as a sort of\nRorschach test\u2014we see more in Fanon than is in the text. This is\nthe fecundity of Fanon\u2019s thinking, really. Books like Glen\nCoulthard\u2019s Red Skin, White Masks (2014) and Hamid\nDabashi\u2019s Brown Skin, White Masks (2011) rewrite\nFanon\u2019s first work with an eye toward the similar-yet-different\nforms of colonial experience in indigenous North America (Coulthard)\nand the Middle East (Dabashi). Other writers such as Homi Bhabha,\nNigel Gibson, Lewis Gordon, Richard Pithouse, and others have extended\nFanonian categories and concepts to treat the experience of exile,\nmigration, diaspora, African-American and Caribbean experiences,\ncontemporary post-Apartheid South African struggles for justice, and\nso on. This kind of work underscores the fecundity of Fanon\u2019s\nideas, their elasticity and capacity for extending across historically\nand culturally diverse geographies. Such elasticity and capacity\nlargely derives from Fanon\u2019s attention to the colonized as a\nlumpen and revolutionary force, something to which he gives great\ndescriptive and existential depth, rather than merely making an\nabstract ideological centerpiece. This attentiveness to the presence\nof deep resistance amongst the masses, even in the midst of profound\nand powerful forms of colonial oppression, is one of Fanon\u2019s\ngreatest contributions to revolutionary theorizing of the black\nAtlantic, global south, and racially marginalized populations. It is\nwhy Fanon\u2019s work so exceeds page count and number of books. To\nhave located and described the colonized subject under colonial\ndomination with such precision and texture\u2014this is Fanon\u2019s\ngift to scholars, for sure, but more than that it is his gift to all\nwho are engaged in radical struggle against racialized oppression.\n",
