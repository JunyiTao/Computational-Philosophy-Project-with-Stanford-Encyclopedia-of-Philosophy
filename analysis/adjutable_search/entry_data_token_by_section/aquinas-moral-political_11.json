    "main_text": "Moral principles || Conscience\n3.1 Conscience\n\nConscience in Aquinas\u2019 view is not a special power or presence\nwithin us, but is our practical intelligence at work, primarily in the\nform of a stock of judgments about the reasonableness (rightness) or\nunreasonableness (wrongness) of kinds of action (kinds of option).\nSince each such judgment is of the form \u201c[It is true that]\naction of the kind phi is always [or generally] wrong [or: is\ngenerally to be done, etc.]\u201d or \u201cphi is [always]\n[or: generally] required [or forbidden] by reason\u201d, it must be\nthe case \u2013 as Aquinas stresses very forcefully \u2013 that\none\u2019s conscience is binding upon oneself even when it is utterly\nmistaken and directs or licenses awful misdeeds. For since it is\nlogically impossible that one could be aware that one\u2019s present\njudgment of conscience is mistaken, setting oneself against\none\u2019s own firm judgment of conscience is setting oneself against\nthe goods of truth and reasonableness, and that cannot fail to be\nwrong: ST I-II q. 19 a. 5; Ver. q. 17 a. 4. The fact\nthat, if one has formed one\u2019s judgment corruptly, one will also\nbe acting wrongly if one follows it (ST I-II q. 19 a. 6) does\nnot affect the obligatoriness (for oneself) of one\u2019s conscience.\nThis teaching about conscience was rather novel in his day and to this\nday is often misrepresented or misapplied as a kind of relativism or\nsubjectivism. But it is actually an implication of Aquinas\u2019\nclarity about the implications of regarding moral judgments as\ntrue (or false) and of thus rejecting subjectivism\nand relativism.\n",
