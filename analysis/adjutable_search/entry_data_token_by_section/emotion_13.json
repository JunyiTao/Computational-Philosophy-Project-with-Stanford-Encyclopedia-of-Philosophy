    "main_text": "The Motivational Tradition in Recent Philosophy || Attitudinal and Motivational Theories: Emotions as Attitudes and Motive States\n9.1 Attitudinal and Motivational Theories: Emotions as Attitudes and Motive States\n\nThere are two main flavors of the Motivational Tradition in\ncontemporary philosophy of emotions. The phenomenological\nversion, articulated by Deonna and Teroni (2012, 2015), assumes\nthat emotions are feelings of action readiness. The\nnon-phenomenological version, articulated by Scarantino\n(2014, 2015) identifies emotions as causes of states of action\nreadiness which may or may not be felt. Both versions agree that the\nfundamental aspect of an emotion is the way it motivates the emoter to\nact.\n\nDeonna and Teroni argue that both judgmentalist and perceptual\ntheories of emotion make the mistake of identifying emotions in terms\nof content rather than in terms of attitude or\nmode. As Searle (1979: 48) points out, \u201c[a]ll\nintentional states consist of a representative content in a\npsychological mode\u201d. For example, believing and desiring are\ndifferent psychological modes or attitudes, and they each have a\ncontent\u2014respectively, what is believed or desired as captured by\na proposition.\n\nIf emotions were special kinds of judgments or perceptions, they would\ndiffer from other kinds of judgments or perceptions not in terms of\nattitude but merely in terms of content\u2014what is judged\nor perceived when we emote. Furthermore, the emotions themselves would\ndiffer from one another only in terms of content rather than attitude,\nbecause there would be no attitude specific to, say, anger, shame,\nguilt and so on, but rather a common attitude\u2014the judging\nattitude or the perceiving attitude\u2014towards different contents.\nDeonna and Teroni (2015) think that this approach fails to capture not\nonly what differentiates emotions from one another, but also what\nmakes them special as motivational states.\n\nAs an alternative, they propose an attitudinal theory of\nemotions. On this view, fear of a tiger is neither the judgment\nnor the perception that there is something dangerous at hand, but\nrather the attitude of taking-as-dangerous directed towards the\ncontent that there is a tiger. What gives emotional attitudes their\ncontent, Deonna and Teroni continue, are their cognitive\nbases, which are the ways in which the content that there is a\ntiger is cognized\u2014e.g., through perception, imagination,\ninference and so on (e.g., the perception that there is a tiger).\n\nBut what sort of attitude is the one that constitutes an emotion\nrather than, say, a judgment or a perception? Deonna and Teroni\nconsider emotional attitudes to be essentially experiences of feeling\none\u2019s body ready for action. For example, fear of a dog amounts\nto \u201can experience of the dog as dangerous\u201d insofar as it\nis \u201can experience of one\u2019s body being prepared\u201d for\navoidance (Deonna & Teroni 2015: 303). Similarly, anger at a\nperson \u201cis an experience of offensiveness insofar as it consists\nin an experience of one\u2019s body being prepared to\nretaliate\u201d (2015: 303). Thus, emotions are felt attitudes of\naction readiness irreducible to non-emotional attitudes and specific\nto each emotion (for a critique of the attitudinal theory, see Rossi\n& Tappolet forthcoming).\n\nThe starting point of Scarantino\u2019s (2014) Motivational\nTheory of Emotions is the conviction that emotions are\nirreducible not just to judgments and perceptions, but also to\nfeelings, and should be understood instead as special kinds of\n\u201ccentral motive states\u201d or \u201cbehavioral\nprograms\u201d. Central motive states or behavioral programs are\ndefined by what they do rather than by how they feel. And what they do\nis to provide a \u201cgeneral direction for behavior by selectively\npotentiating coherent sets of behavioral options\u201d (Gallistel\n1980: 322).\n\nThis selective potentiation can result in feelings, but the phenomenal\nchanges are not necessary to the potentiation itself, which consists\nof changes in the probabilities of behavioral options. To exemplify,\nfear involves the selective potentiation of options that share the\ngoal of avoiding a certain target appraised as dangerous, anger\ninvolves the selective potentiation of options that share the goal of\nattacking a certain target appraised as offensive, guilt involves the\nselective potentiation of options that share the goal of repairing a\nrelationship appraised as damaged by actions that fell short of\none\u2019s moral standards, and so on. \n\nThe Motivational Theory of Emotions is inspired by Frijda\u2019s\n(1986) theory of emotions as action tendencies, but there are some\ndifferences. Scarantino (2014, 2015) draws a distinction between an\nemotion and an episode of emotion, with the emotion\ncorresponding to what causes a change in action readiness and the\nepisode of emotion corresponding to the actual change of action\nreadiness. But Scarantino borrows a key ingredient from Frijda\u2019s\n(1986) theory, namely the assumption that action tendencies must have\ncontrol precedence to become emotional. Control precedence\ninvolves interrupting competing processes, preempting access\u2014in\nmemory, inference, perception, etc.\u2014to information not related\nto the avoidance goal and preparing the body for action. \n\nThe idea that emotions are behavioral programs that bring about\nprioritized impulses to act can be combined with an origin\nstory about how some of such programs evolved to deal with\nfundamental life tasks, leading to what Scarantino (2015) has labeled\nthe New Basic Emotion Theory. According to it, learning can affect\nboth what activates the evolved program (input) and what responses the\nprogram brings about (output) through the interplay of the prioritized\naction tendency and regulation. This will result in massive\nvariability of the actual responses observed upon the activation of\nany basic emotion, shielding the New BET from the lack of\n\u201cbodily signatures\u201d problem.\n\nFinally, Scarantino (2014) endorses a teleosemantic theory of content\nfor emotions to deal with the problem of intentionality, and proposes\nthat different emotions differ from one another and from non-emotional\nstates both in terms of the state of prioritized action\ntendency they cause (the attitude) and in terms of what they represent\n(the content). On this view, fear is a prioritizing action control\nprogram which represents dangers because it has the function of\ncausing avoidant behaviors in the presence of danger, anger is a\nprioritizing action control program which represents slights because\nit has the function of causing aggressive behaviors in the presence of\nslights, and so on.\n\nA central challenge for motivational theories of emotions of both\nphenomenological and non-phenomenological varieties is to account for\nthe states of action readiness distinctive of different emotions.\nFirst, many emotions do not appear to motivate action at all. Grief\nand depression, for example, seem to involve a general depotentiation\nof the readiness to act. Second, it is unclear which action tendencies\n\u201cbackward-looking\u201d emotions like regret could elicit,\nbecause they focus on what happened in the past, which cannot be\nchanged. Third, emotions like joy involve the selective potentiation\nof a fairly open range of behavioral options, so it is unclear what\naction tendency may be associated with them. Fourth, it seems to be\npossible for the same action tendency to be associated with different\nemotions, and for different emotions to be associated with the same\naction tendency, provided that these tendencies are described at a\nsufficiently abstract level of analysis (for critiques of motivational\napproaches, see, e.g., Reisenzein 1996; Prinz 2004; Tappolet 2010,\n2016; Eder & Rothermund 2013).\n",
