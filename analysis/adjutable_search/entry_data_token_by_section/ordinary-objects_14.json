The mere possibility of gunky objects\nunderwrites an argument against the nihilist thesis that (actually)\nthere are no composite objects.\n\n(GK1)\nIt is possible for there to be gunky objects.\n(GK2)\nIf gunky objects are possible, then nihilism isn\u2019t\nnecessarily true.\n(GK3)\nIf nihilism isn\u2019t necessarily true, then nihilism\nisn\u2019t actually true.\n(GK4)\nSo, nihilism is false.\n\n\nGK1 is plausible. It seems easy enough to imagine gunky objects, for\ninstance by imagining an object with a right and left half, each of\nwhich itself has a right and left half, which themselves have right\nand left halves \u2026 \u201call the way down\u201d, and never\nterminating in simple parts. Moreover, it may even be that\nactually all objects are gunky. GK2 is trivial: if there are\ngunky objects in world w, then there is something with parts in w, in\nwhich case there are composites in w and nihilism is false in w. GK3\nis plausible as well: the actual world contains what would seem to be\nparadigm cases of composites (trees, etc.), so if composition occurs\nanywhere, it surely occurs here. Moreover, nihilism is meant to be an\nanswer to the special composition question, and one would expect such\nan answer to be giving necessary and sufficient conditions for\ncomposition\u2014in which case one would expect proponents of\nnihilism to regard it as a necessary\n truth.[73]\n\nSome will deny GK1. What does seem obviously possible (and easily\nimaginable) for there to be certain kinds of infinite descent. But\ninfinite descent need not be mereological. For instance, it does seem\npossible for there to be objects that can be divided into two halves,\nand whose halves can in turn be divided into two halves, and so on.\nBut it is controversial whether the fact that o can be\ndivided into two halves, h1 and h2, entails that\no is not simple. One might deny that h1 and h2\nexist at all before the division: they are brought into existence when\no is divided and, a fortiori, are not parts of o prior to division. Or\none might concede that, prior to division, h1 and\nh2 exist and are partially colocated with o, but deny that\nthey are thereby parts of\n o.[74]\n\nOne might instead reject GK3 on the grounds that it runs afoul of\n\u201cHume\u2019s Dictum\u201d, according to which there can be no\nnecessary connections among distinct existences. There is some\ncontroversy about how best to understand Hume\u2019s Dictum and, in\nparticular, whether it prohibits necessary connections even between\noverlapping items (which typically are thought not to be\n\u201cdistinct\u201d in the relevant sense). But assuming that it\ndoes, then it will rule out any principle of composition according to\nwhich simples in certain arrangements cannot fail to compose\nsomething\u2014for this would be to impose a necessary connection\nbetween simples being in that arrangement and the existence of a\n(numerically distinct) whole that they compose. And if we cannot in\ngeneral expect theories of composition to be necessary if true, we\nshould not expect nihilism to be necessary if\n true.[75]\n\nJust as the possibility of infinite descent can be wielded against\nnihilism, the possibility of infinite ascent can be wielded against\nuniversalism. Let us say that a world is \u201cjunky\u201d iff every\nobject in that world is a part of some further object.\n\n(JK1)\nJunky worlds are possible.\n(JK2)\nIf junky worlds are possible, then universalism isn\u2019t\nnecessarily true.\n(JK3)\nIf universalism isn\u2019t necessarily true, then universalism\nisn\u2019t actually true.\n(JK4)\nSo, universalism is false.\n\n\nThe idea behind JK1 is supposed to be that, just as there is no\nlogical or conceptual barrier to an infinite descent of parts, there\nis no logical or conceptual barrier to an infinite ascent of wholes.\n(Though not everyone finds themselves able to conceive of junky\nworlds.) The idea behind JK2 runs as follows. According to\nuniversalism, every plurality of objects has a fusion, and, in\nparticular, the plurality consisting of all things has a fusion. But\nthere can be no fusion of all things in a junky world. For that fusion\nwould have to be a part of something (since the world is junky); but\nif it already has everything as a part, there is nothing left for it\nto be a part of. JK3 can be motivated in much the same way as GK3:\nuniversalism is meant to be an answer to the special composition\nquestion, and thus will presumably be necessary if true. The\nstrategies considered above for resisting the gunk argument seem to\napply equally to the junk argument\u2014one can, for instance, deny\nthat we are imagining what we think we are, or one can invoke\nHume\u2019s Dictum and deny that universalism is necessary if\n true.[76]\n",
