    "main_text": "Maimon\u2019s Influence on the Formation of German Idealism\n7. Maimon\u2019s Influence on the Formation of German Idealism\n\nKant\u2019s high regard for Maimon was shared by a number of the\nimportant figures of the movements of German Enlightenment and\nIdealism. Mendelssohn, of course, had initially recognized the genius\nbeneath Maimon\u2019s coarse exterior, and Reinhold too took Maimon\nseriously, although their relation soured after Maimon published a\nvolume of their increasingly acrimonious correspondence without\nReinhold\u2019s permission. On a much more positive note, Fichte\nwrote that his admiration for Maimon\u2019s talent \u201c[k]nows no\nlimit,\u201d and he continues that \u201cMaimon has completely\noverturned the entire Kantian philosophy as it has been understood by\neveryone until now.\u201d (Gesamtausgabe III, 2: 275)\n\nAlthough Maimon\u2019s positive system was of interest to the German\nphilosophical community in the 1790s, his greatest influence was as a\nskeptic, and in particular as a critic of the \u2018cognitive\ndualism\u2019 that characterized Kant\u2019s critical philosophy.\nThe force of Maimon\u2019s objections to Kant was felt most directly\nby Fichte, who in the Wissenschaftslehre devotes considerable\nattention to Maimon\u2019s skeptical challenge to Kant. For Fichte,\nMaimon pointed out the fatal shortcomings of Kant\u2019s system, but\nfailed to move beyond a skepticism about the prospects for knowledge.\nThis is reflected in Fichte\u2019s claim that Maimon\u2019s position\n\u201cwould ground a skepticism that taught us to doubt our own\nexistence.\u201d (GA I, 2: 369) Fichte sought to remedy this\nsituation by developing a more thoroughgoing idealistic account of\nexperience, one which placed the notion of \u2018positing\u2019 at\nthe center of the system. Only in so doing, Fichte claims, can both\nKant\u2019s dualism and Maimon\u2019s skepticism be avoided.\n\nThe Wissenschaftslehre set the stage for the subsequent rise\nof Absolute Idealism, and its key commitments: the centrality of a\nproductive faculty of mind, as well as an embrace of a rationalist\nmethodology and a concomitant rejection of any type of dualism. In\nthis respect, the project of Absolute Idealism owes much to Maimon,\nwho himself had developed just these themes in his various works. But\nwhere Fichte \u2014 and Schelling and Hegel \u2014 stand as\noptimists about the prospects for this type of philosophical inquiry,\nMaimon remains much less sanguine about the ability of finite minds to\nreach a final \u2018System\u2019 of philosophy. It is perhaps\ntestament to the force of Maimon\u2019s skepticism that while the\nSystems of German Idealism have collapsed, the skeptical challenge\nMaimon poses for accounts of experience remains vital and forceful\n\u2014 if unduly neglected \u2014 today. Maimon, that is,\nanticipates key points of the contemporary debates about the nature of\nGivenness, and his skeptical position offers and interesting and novel\nperspective on discussions of the issue.\n\nMaimon also seems to have played an important role in the reception of\nSpinoza in German Idealism. Maimon was not only the first to try to\ncreate a synthesis between Kantian idealism and Spinozistic pantheism\n(GW III 455), but he was also apparently the first to suggest\nthat Spinoza\u2019s philosophy was not atheistic, but rather a strong\nthough unorthodox religious view. Instead of characterizing\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy as atheism, a view which denies Gods\nexistence, Maimon argues that it should rather be called acosmism,\ninsofar as it denies the reality of the diverse world and affirms the\nsole reality of God. This characterization of Spinoza was later\nadopted by Hegel (See Hegel\u2019s Encyclopedia Logic,\nsections 50 and 151, and his discussion of Spinoza in the Lectures\non the History of Philosophy) and seems to play a central role in\nHegel\u2019s perception of Spinoza.\n",
