    "main_text": "Varieties of Supervenience || Weak and Strong Individual Supervenience\n4.1 Weak and Strong Individual Supervenience\n\nKim (1984, 1987) distinguished two different kinds of individual\nsupervenience, weak and strong. They are defined by means of\nquantification over possible worlds, as follows:\n\nA-properties weakly supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any possible world w\nand any individuals x and y in w, if\nx and y are B-indiscernible in w,\nthen they are A-indiscernible in w.\n\n\nA-properties strongly supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any possible worlds\nw1 and\nw2 and any individuals x\nin w1 and y in\nw2, if x in\nw1 is B-indiscernible from\ny in w2, then x\nin w1 is A-indiscernible\nfrom y in w2. (Kim\n1987.)\n\n\nx and y are A-indiscernible if and only if\nthey are exactly alike with respect to every A-property;\nsimilarly for B-indiscernibility. (Here times are omitted,\nbut of course objects may be A-indiscernible at one time, but\nnot at another.) The possible worlds quantified over might include all\nmetaphysically possible worlds, or only nomologically possible worlds\n(etc.), depending upon what degree of modal force is intended.\n\nAs the names indicate, strong individual supervenience is stronger\nthan weak individual supervenience. (We shall hereafter follow\nestablished usage and drop the word \u2018individual\u2019 unless\nclarity requires it.) Weak supervenience says that there is no\npossible world that contains individuals that are\nB-indiscernible but A-discernible. Strong\nsupervenience entails that there are no possible individuals that are\nB-indiscernible but A-discernible, whether they\nare in the same world or different worlds. When the range of\nworlds is the same, strong supervenience theses entail weak\nsupervenience theses, but the latter do not in general entail the\nformer. It is important to note, however, that when A is\nrestricted to intrinsic properties, strong and weak supervenience are\narguably equivalent; see Section 4.3.4. \n\nOccasionally philosophers appeal to weak supervenience rather than\nstrong supervenience. Hare, for example, said that his claim that\nvalue properties supervene on other properties was intended to be an\nappeal only to weak supervenience (1984, 4). And Davidson similarly\nclaimed that his appeal to supervenience was intended to be an appeal\nonly to weak supervenience (1985, 1993, esp. 4n4). (He said this in\nresponse to Kim (1984), who argued that Davidson cannot appeal to\nstrong supervenience on pain of commitment to strict psychophysical\nlaws, which are incompatible with Davidson\u2019s well-known thesis\nof the anomalism of the mental, according to which there are no strict\npsychophysical laws. See the entry on anomalous monism.)\n\nBut appealing to weak supervenience while denying strong generates a\ncertain explanatory burden. You will recall that we always want an\nexplanation of why a supervenience relation holds (see\n Section 3.7).\n Thus someone who asserts a weak supervenience thesis but denies the\ncorresponding strong supervenience thesis must provide an explanation\nof why the weak supervenience thesis is true that does not entail that\nthe relevant strong supervenience thesis is true as well. And that can\nlook mysterious: if there can be things in different worlds\nthat are A-discernible but not B-discernible, why\ncan\u2019t there be two such things within a single world? If\neverything within each world that is B-indiscernible is\nA-indiscernible, how can different worlds enforce\ndifferent B\u2192A property pairings? (See\nBlackburn on the need to explain the \u201cban on mixed\nworlds,\u201d 1973, 1985, and especially 1984, 184.)\n\nSometimes there is an explanation of why weak supervenience holds\ndespite the fact that strong supervenience does not. If, within a\nworld, two individuals assert exactly the same propositions, then they\nare exactly alike vis-\u00e0-vis having asserted a true proposition:\nthe one asserted at least one true proposition if and only if the\nother did. The reason is that a proposition will have a unique\ntruth-value relative to a world. The following weak supervenience\nthesis thus holds: for any world w, and any individuals\nx and y in w, if x and y\nare indiscernible with respect to what propositions they have\nasserted, then they are indiscernible with respect to having asserted\na true proposition. Contingent propositions, however, are true in some\nworlds and false in others. It is thus possible for two individuals in\ndifferent worlds to assert exactly the same propositions, and yet\ndiffer with respect to having asserted a true proposition. The one\nmight assert many true propositions, while the other fails to assert\nany true proposition. It follows that the following strong\nsupervenience thesis is false: for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, any individuals x in\nw1 and y in\nw2, if x in\nw1 is indiscernible from y\nin w2, with respect to what\npropositions they have asserted, then x in\nw1 is indiscernible from y\nin w2 with respect to having\nasserted a true proposition.\n\nIn contrast, it is by no means clear why mental properties would\nweakly supervene on physical properties without strongly supervening\non them; and the analogous question arises for moral properties and\nnonmoral properties. Davidson and Hare owe us an explanation of why\nmental and moral properties weakly supervene, respectively, on\nphysical and nonmoral ones\u2014and it must be an explanation that\ndoes not entail that strong supervenience holds as well. Simon\nBlackburn\u2019s well-known argument against moral realism basically\nconstitutes an attempt to answer this question for Hare. Though\nBlackburn speaks of \u2018supervenience\u2019 and\n\u2018necessitation\u2019 rather than weak and strong supervenience,\nhis argument against moral realism rests on exactly the\ndemand for explanation that we have been exploring. He claims, 1) that\nmoral properties weakly supervene on nonmoral properties, but do not\nstrongly supervene on them, 2) that this requires explanation, and 3)\nthat projectivists can do this better than moral realists (1973,\n1985.) We are content to note that some such answer is required from\nanyone who holds a weak supervenience thesis without the corresponding\nstrong supervenience thesis.\n\nOne final matter concerning the notions of weak and strong\nsupervenience remains to be discussed. This is that they are sometimes\nformulated differently, by means of modal operators rather than\nquantification over possible worlds:\n\n\nA weakly supervenesm on\nB if and only if necessarily, if anything x has some\nproperty F in A, then there is at least one property\nG in B such that x has G, and\neverything that has G has F, i.e., iff \n\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200F\u2208A[Fx\n\u2192 \u2203G\u2208B(Gx &\n\u2200y(Gy \u2192 Fy))]\n\n\nA strongly supervenesm on\nB if and only if necessarily, if anything x has some\nproperty F in A, then there is at least one property\nG in B such x has G, and\nnecessarily everything that has G has F, i.e., iff\n\n\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200F\u2208A[Fx\n\u2192 \u2203G\u2208B(Gx &\n\u25a1\u2200y(Gy \u2192 Fy))]\n\n\n(Kim 1984)\n\n\nNotice that strong superveniencem is\nformulated just like weak superveniencem,\nexcept that it contains one more necessity operator.\n\nKim initially maintained that the modal operator versions are\nequivalent to the above possible world definitions of weak and strong\nsupervenience respectively (see esp. 1987, 79\u201382). But they are\nnot; they are stronger. On certain assumptions (e.g. that modal\noperators are to be understood as quantifiers over worlds), the modal\noperator versions of strong and weak supervenience respectively entail\nthe possible world versions; but not vice versa (McLaughlin\n1995).\n\nThe reasoning here is basically the same as that given in\n Section 3.2\n above for why supervenience does not guarantee entailment. Both\nweakm and strongm supervenience\nsay i) that it is necessary that everything that has an\nA-property has some B-property or other, and ii)\nthat that B-property entails the A-property. But\nneither i) nor ii) follows from the possible world versions of either\nweak or strong supervenience\u2014unless B is assumed to be\nclosed under the Boolean operations of complementation, infinitary\nconjunction, infinitary disjunction, and property-forming operations\ninvolving quantification (McLaughlin 1995). Without that assumption,\nthe possible worlds versions allow things with A-properties\nto lack B-properties altogether, and a fortiori to\nlack any B-property that entails their A-properties.\nOf course, possible worlds supervenience requires that each pair of\nB-less intraworld (weak) or interworld (strong) individuals\nmust have the same A-properties, but the possible\nworld versions allow B-less individuals to have\nA-properties. The modal operator versions do not.\n\nIt should therefore come as no surprise that the cases that served as\ncounterexamples to the claim that supervenience is a form of\nentailment also serve as counterexamples to the equivalence of the\npossible worlds and modal operator formulations of supervenience.\nBeing F strongly supervenes on being not-F, but\nfails to even weakly supervenem on it.\n{P & Q} strongly supervenes on {P,\nQ}, but fails to even weakly\nsupervenem on it. The possible world\nversions of weak and strong supervenience are weaker than the\ncorresponding modal operator versions. The latter go beyond the basic\nidea that there cannot be an A-difference without a\nB-difference. Again, though, the modal operator versions\nare equivalent to the possible worlds versions if the base\nset B is closed under Boolean operations, and operations\ninvolving quantification.\n",
