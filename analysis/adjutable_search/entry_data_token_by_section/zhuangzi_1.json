    "main_text": "A Modern Philosophical Interpretation || Doubting Intuitionism\n4.4 Doubting Intuitionism\nGraham\u2019s Zhuangzi then addressed this Mencian response in a\npassage that extends the Hume-like skepticism about any identifiable\n\u201cinner self\u201d. That should be what guides the naturally occurring emotive\nreactions that are necessary for a w\u01d2I:me\nthat chooses. It seems, he says, there must be one, but we find no\nevidence of it. We approve of behaviors and place our trust in its\nreactions but find no sign of what is authorizing or making them. \n\nHundreds of parts, nine\nopenings and six viscera included and completed\n (\u6210 ch\u00e9ngfixed)\nin place in us, with which should I feel most akin? Should I be\npleased with them all?  Is there a w\u01d2I:me\namong them?\u00a0 Among them, should we deem some as rulers and as\nservants? Are the rulers and servants incapable of governing each\nother? Are they not capable of taking turns as ruler and servants? Is\nthere a genuine ruler among them?\u00a0 It\u2019s as if trying and\nfailing to grasp its real character has no bearing on whether it is\ngenuine. (Ibid., HY 4/2/16\u201318)\n\nMozi had worried that it would be circular to appeal to intuitions about the word use in a social d\u00e0o to authorize that very practice, for example Confucian ritual. Being a product\nof ritual training. acquired intuitions could not be a sufficiently\nneutral way of justifying our choosing ritual as our social\nguide. Nor could one trained practitioner have authority over another\nin resolving interpretive disputes about how to execute the ritual,\ne.g., about how to apply the terms found in ritual texts to concrete real-time\nbehaviors. He insisted we need a neutral, non-cultural or natural\nbasis for such meta-choices of social practices of choosing and interpreting practices. \n\nThe narrative history of Classical thought found near the end of the\nZhuangzi (Ibid., HY 90/33/1) takes off from this\ndispute between Confucians and Mohists. It welcomes Mozi\u2019s\nimplicit search for neutrality, universality, and greater\nobjectivity. However, the school viewed the familiar debate between a\nutilitarian and traditional morality as interminable because\nMozi\u2019s d\u00e0oguide, like\nConfucius\u2019s, starts from different standards, different \u6210\nch\u00e9ngconstructed commitments to linguistic\npractices. Each relies on their past practice of judging how to use\nthe key moral \u540d m\u00edngnames.\nConfucians would reject Mozi\u2019s standards because they led to what\nConfucians view as the wrong conclusions (e.g., implied\nConfucians should abandon \u7fa9 y\u00ec moral\nrituals such as burial). The Mohists reject burial rituals because\nthey use \u7fa9 y\u00ec morality of the social\nmores reformed according to their standard of general utility.  The\npivotal statement of Zhuangzi\u2019s position is expressed as a riff\non the relativity or dependence of \u662f\u975e\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments about\nlanguage use on natural circumstances, naturally existing past\npractice, commitments and attitudinal gestalt shifts. \nWhere can\n\u9053 d\u00e0oguides hide such that there are\ngenuine and artificial? Where can\n\u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage\u00a0 hide such that\nthere is \u662f \u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not\nthat.  Where can d\u00e0os hide such that they do not\nexist? How can a \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage exist\nand not be \u53ef k\u011bassertible?\nD\u00e0os hide behind small achievements and language hides\nbehind rhetorical flourishes and elaboration. So you have the\n\u201cthis is right-that is wrong\u201d of the Confucians and\nMohists. Of what one says \u201cthis is right\u201d the other says\n\u201cthat is wrong\u201d and of what they say \u201cthat is\nwrong\u201d says \u201cthis is right.\u201d If you want to\n\u201cwrong\u201d what the other \u201crights\u201d and\n\u201cright\u201d what the other \u2018wrong\u2019s, nothing\nmatches \u660e m\u00edngdiscerning. (Ibid.,\nHY4/2/24\u20137)\n\nThough balanced in judging this impasse, the Zhuangzi\u2019s\ninteresting target is the Mohist aspiration to objectivity. Many\nstories in the text target the notion that utility is a\nnaturally constant value\u2014particularly the human utility\nthat Mozi champions. Among this series of parables, the most famous,\nthe useless tree, illustrates the relativity of usefulness to Hui\nShi. (Ibid., \u00a0HY 3/1/46\u20137)\n\nNot only are we implicitly appealing to a d\u00e0o in\nchoosing to adopt a benefit/harm standard, we are also going to appeal\nto interpretive d\u00e0o to judge whether we have followed\nit correctly or not. Mozi had treated moral disputes as disagreements\nabout how to \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinguish in\napplying terms like \u7fa9 y\u00ecmorality and\n\u5584 sh\u00e0ngood-at. He had also objected\nto Confucian reliance on acquired intuition since it made access to\nsuch judgments esoteric. He argued that standards governing such\nevaluative word use should be made by \u6cd5\nf\u01cemeasurement standards that are accessible\nto the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of ordinary people. His utility\nstandard, Zhuangzi is suggesting, is still relative to the\nway of translating it to behavior. \n\nOthers in the ethical debate, notably Yang Zhu and related\nPrimitivists, also appealed to ti\u0101n (natural constancy)\nas a normative arbiter. The growing awareness that norms of behavior\nare intertwined with norms of language use, produced another feature\nof this strand of thought bringing the natural world into our\nguidance. Primitivists came to advocate silence\u2014letting the natural\npaths of the world take over completely. \n For most of history, the Laozi has exemplified this rejection of language. It\ntreated all social \u9053\nd\u00e0ospaths as implicit rejections of the\nnatural \u9053 d\u00e0opath. Graham has argued\nthat echoes of this line of thinking lay in the background of\nMencius\u2019s thought. That concern led him to attempt to substitute\nnatural moral psychology (a natural moral disposition in human\n\u5fc3 x\u012bnheart-mind) for positive social\nmores. \n\nA paradigm of this anti-language, silence trend (cited in the\nZhuangzi\u2019s internal history just before discussing the\nLaozi group ) was Shen Dao. Shen Dao postulated a\n\u201cGreat D\u00e0o\u201d (essentially the actual course\nof cosmic history from past to future) which \u201ceven a clod of\nearth\u201d will follow. We all will follow Great\nD\u00e0o. We can (and should) therefore abandon knowledge\nof how to make linguistic distinctions (\u662f\u975e\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments) to\nfollow Great D\u00e0o. Shen Dao, based on his version of\nlogical determinism (i.e., There being an actual complete history of\nspace-time entails your behavior tomorrow is included) draws an\nanti-normative, quietist and stoic conclusion.\n\nLater Mohist writings contain several acute critiques of such a\ntrending pro-silence posture. Deeming all \u8a00\ny\u00e1nlanguage as not-\u53ef\nk\u011bassertible is not \u53ef\nk\u011bassertible. The explanation, later Mohists\nnoted, lies in the asserter\u2019s own use of\n \u8a00 y\u00e1nlanguage. Rejecting\n(f\u0113i-ing) all sh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgments is\nf\u0113i (wrong, to be rejected). Similarly self-defeating is\n\u201cteaching not to teach.\u201d \n\nZhuangzi\u2019s \u201cpipes of nature\u201d metaphor signals his\ndeparture from these defective Laozi-like or Primitivist\nanti-language positions. Language is natural and arguments for silence\nare self-condemning. So the point of Zhuangzi\u2019s own reflections on the\nabsence of natural normative endorsement of our\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that\u00a0 decisions\nshould not guide us to stop making them. Making them is what\nwe naturally do when we find our\nd\u00e0os in nature. It is natural for us to make\na judgment, but not nature making it. Normativity arises from within\nnature, but nature only makes all its normative, behavior-guiding\npaths for us naturally available.\n",
