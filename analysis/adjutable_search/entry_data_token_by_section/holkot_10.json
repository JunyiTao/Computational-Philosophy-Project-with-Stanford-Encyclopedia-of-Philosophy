    "main_text": "Divine Foreknowledge || The \u201cobligational\u201d model\n6.1 The \u201cobligational\u201d model\n\nWhat Holkot added to the discussion was an elaborate analysis of such\npuzzles using the rules and structure of obligational debates to\nexplore counterfactual possibility. Debates de obligatione\nwere a commonplace in the medieval university curriculum and involved\none person, the \u201copponent\u201d posing a proposition to\nanother, the \u201crespondent,\u201d that, if accepted, would form\nthe basis for a continuing exchange. The posed proposition was usually\na counterfactual or a proposition whose truth status was uncertain.\nThe opponent then proposed further propositions to the respondent,\neach of which might follow from, contradict or be irrelevant to the\nfirst. The respondent was to take the first proposition as true for\nthe time of the debate (understood in Holkot\u2019s version to take\nplace in a single hypothetical instant of time), and to respond with\nagreement or rejection depending on whether the succeeding\npropositions followed from what had been agreed on before or\ncontradicted the preceding concessions. If a proposed proposition was\nunconnected with any of the preceding propositions, the respondent\nwould respond with agreement, rejection or doubt depending on what he\nunderstood the actual state of affairs in the world to be. The forms\nand rules of obligational debate suggested a rigorous format for\nexploring the contingent possibilities, which Holkot adopted (Gelber\n2004, 171\u2013189; Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 26\u201330).\n\nA simple form of the puzzle might proceed as follows:\n\nOpponent: Let it be the case that God knows a will be, where\na is a future contingent.\n\n\nRespondent: I accept.\n\nOpponent: Everything that is possible to be is also possible not to be\n(by the definition of contingency).\n\nRespondent: I accept.\n\nOpponent: As a future contingent, a is possible to be and\npossible not to be.\n\nRespondent: I accept.\n\nOpponent (from the Aristotelian rule that the impossible does not\nfollow from the possible): Let it be the case that a will not\nbe.\n\nRespondent: I accept.\n\nOpponent: Then God is deceived.\n\n\nIn resolving such puzzles, Holkot invoked a series of rules, one of\nwhich has significance for his moral philosophy, as well. Holkot\nargued that when the opponent proposed the initial proposition, he was\nalso implicitly posing the rejection of its contradictory. The\nAristotelian rule that the impossible does not follow from the\npossible, seems to allow the contradictory of the initial proposition\nto enter the debate. But Holkot argued that such a move in effect\namounted to starting the debate all over again with a new starting\npoint, a proposition contradictory to the first. The respondent would\nnow be obliged, if he continued with the debate, to answer in\naccordance with the new contradictory proposition, and would refuse to\nconcede that \u201cGod is deceived.\u201d\n\nHolkot viewed the human relationship to divine revelation as\nequivalent to engaging in an obligational debate. The faithful\nobligated themselves to accept divine revelations as true for the time\nof this life (even though as contingents it was possible that they\nmight not be true), and if God commanded them to act in a way contrary\nto previous commands, the new commandment would supersede the old,\njust as if a new obligational debate had begun. Those who accepted the\nobligation to obey, would also be obligated to live in a way that was\nconsistent with the obligations incurred, even if God did not reveal\nthe details. Human reason was required to discern how to act in\nuncertain cases.\n",
