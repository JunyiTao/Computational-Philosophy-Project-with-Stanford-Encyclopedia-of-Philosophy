    "main_text": "Theory of Decoherence || Decoherent histories\n1.2 Decoherent histories\n\nAs mentioned above, when interference is suppressed in a two-slit\nexperiment, the naive probability formula applies, and we can\ncalculate the detection probabilities at the screen by adding\nprobabilities for what are formally the \u2018trajectories\u2019\nfollowed by individual electrons. The decoherent histories or\nconsistent histories formalism (originating with Griffiths 1984;\nOmn\u00e8s 1988, 1989; and Gell-Mann and Hartle 1990) takes this as\nthe defining feature of decoherence. (See also the entry on the\n consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics.\n There are some differences between the various authors, but we shall\ngloss them\n over.[6])\n\nIn a nutshell, the formalism is as follows. Take a sequence of times\n\\(t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_n\\), and take\northogonal families of (Heisenberg-picture) projections at those\n times,[7]\n with\n\n\n\\[\\tag{1}\n\\sum_{\\alpha_1} P_{\\alpha_1}(t_1) = \\mathbf{1},\\ldots ,\\sum_{\\alpha_{ n} } P_{\\alpha_n}(t_n)\n= \\mathbf{1}\n\\]\n\n\nOne defines histories as time-ordered sequences of projections\nat the given times, choosing one projection from each family,\nrespectively. Such histories form a so-called alternative and\nexhaustive set of histories.\n\nTake a state \\(\\varrho\\). We wish to define probabilities for the set of\nhistories. If one takes the usual probability formula based on\nrepeated application of the Born rule, one obtains\n\n\\[\\tag{2}\n\\text{Tr}(P_{\\alpha_n}(t_n)\\ldots P_{\\alpha_1}(t_0)\n\\varrho P_{\\alpha_1}(t_0)\\ldots P_{\\alpha_n}(t_n))\n\\]\n\n\nWe shall take (2) as defining \u2018candidate probabilities\u2019.\nIn general these probabilities exhibit interference, in the sense that\nsumming over them is not equivalent to omitting the intermediate\nprojections in (2) (\u2018coarse-graining\u2019 the histories). In\nthe special cases in which the interference terms vanish for any pair\nof distinct histories, we say that the set of histories satisfies the\nconsistency or (weak) decoherence condition. It is easy\nto see that this condition takes the form\n\n\\[\\tag{3}\n\\text{ReTr}(P_{\\alpha'_n}(t_n)\\ldots P_{\\alpha'_1}(t_1)\\varrho P_{\\alpha_1}(t_1)\\ldots P_{\\alpha_n}(t_n))\n= 0\n\\]\n\n\nfor any pair of distinct histories (the real part of the \u2018decoherence\nfunctional\u2019 vanishes).\n\nIf this is satisfied, we can view (2) as defining the distribution\nfunctions for a stochastic process with the histories as trajectories.\nDecoherence in the sense of this abstract formalism is thus defined\nsimply by the condition that the quantum probabilities for later\nevents can be calculated as if the state had collapsed at the\nintermediate times. Qualitatively one recovers classical behaviour, in\nthe sense that the histories are assigned quantum probabilities that\nnevertheless satisfy the classical formula of total probability. \n\nA stronger form of the decoherence condition, namely the vanishing of\nboth the real and imaginary part of the decoherence functional, can be\nused to prove theorems on the existence of (later) \u2018permanent\nrecords\u2019 of (earlier) events in a history, which is a\ngeneralisation of the idea of \u2018environmental\n monitoring\u2019.[8]\n For instance, if the state \\(\\varrho\\) is a pure state \\(\\lvert \\psi \\rangle\\langle\\psi\\rvert\\)\nthis (strong) decoherence condition is equivalent, for all \\(n\\),\nto the orthogonality of the vectors\n\n\\[\\tag{4}\nP_{\\alpha_n}(t_n)\\ldots P_{\\alpha_1}(t_1)\\ket{\\psi}\n\\]\n\n\nand this in turn is equivalent to the existence of a set of orthogonal\nprojections\n\\(R_{\\alpha_1 \\ldots\\alpha_i}(t_i)\\)\n(for any \\(t_i \\le t_n\\))\nthat extend consistently the given set of histories and are perfectly\ncorrelated with the histories of the original set (Gell-Mann and\nHartle 1990). Note, however, that these \u2018generalised\nrecords\u2019 need not be stored in separate degrees of freedom, such\nas an environment or measuring\n apparatus.[9]\n\nVarious authors have taken the theory of decoherent histories as\nproviding an interpretation of quantum mechanics. For instance,\nGell-Mann and Hartle sometimes talk of decoherent histories as a\nneo-Everettian approach, while Omn\u00e8s appears to think of\nhistories along neo-Copenhagen lines (perhaps as an experimental\ncontext creating a \u2018quantum phenomenon\u2019 that can stretch\nback into the\n past).[10]\n Griffiths (2002) has probably developed the most detailed of these\ninterpretational approaches (also addressing various earlier\ncriticisms, e.g. by Dowker and Kent (1995, 1996)). In itself, however,\nthe formalism is interpretationally neutral and has the particular\nmerit of bringing out that when interference is suppressed, one can\nreidentify different components of the state over time, making this\nformalism especially appropriate for discussing temporal evolution at\nthe level of the non-interfering components.\n",
