    "main_text": "Appearances and Things in Themselves\n1. Appearances and Things in Themselves\n\nIn the first edition (A) of the Critique of Pure Reason,\npublished in 1781, Kant argues for a surprising set of claims about\nspace, time, and objects:\n\n Space and time are merely the forms of our sensible intuition of\nobjects. They are not beings that exist independently of our intuition\n(things in themselves), nor are they properties of, nor relations\namong, such beings. (A26, A33)\n The objects we intuit in space and time are appearances, not\nobjects that exist independently of our intuition (things in\nthemselves). This is also true of the mental states we intuit in\nintrospection; in \u201cinner sense\u201d (introspective awareness\nof my inner states) I intuit only how I appear to myself, not how I am\n\u201cin myself\u201d. (A37\u20138, A42)\n We can only cognize objects that we can, in principle, intuit.\nConsequently, we can only cognize objects in space and time,\nappearances. We cannot cognize things in themselves. (A239)\n Nonetheless, we can think about things in themselves using the\ncategories (A254).\n Things in themselves affect us, activating our sensible faculty\n(A190,\n A387).[1]\n\n\nIn the \u201cFourth Paralogism\u201d Kant defines\n\u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d:\n\n\nI understand by the transcendental idealism of all\nappearances [Erscheinungen] the doctrine that they are all\ntogether to be regarded as mere representations and not as things in\nthemselves [nicht als Dinge an sich selbst ansehen], and\naccordingly that space and time are only sensible forms of our\nintuition, but not determinations given for themselves or conditions\nof objects as things in themselves [als Dinge an sich\nselbst]. (A369; the Critique is quoted from the Guyer\n& Wood translation (1998))\n\n\nEver since 1781, the meaning and significance of Kant\u2019s\n\u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d has been a subject of\ncontroversy. Kant\u2019s doctrines raise numerous interpretive\nquestions, which cluster around three sets of issues:\n\n(a)\nThe nature of appearances. Are they (as Kant sometimes\nsuggests) identical to representations, i.e., states of our minds? If\nso, does Kant follow Berkeley in equating bodies (objects in space)\nwith ideas (representations)? If not, what are they, and what relation\ndo they have to our representations of them?\n(b)\nThe nature of things in themselves. What can we say\npositively about them? What does it mean that they are not in space\nand time? How is this claim compatible with the doctrine that we\ncannot know anything about them? How is the claim that they affect us\ncompatible with that doctrine? Is Kant committed to the\nexistence of things in themselves, or is the concept of a\n\u201cthing in itself\u201d merely the concept of a way objects\nmight be (for all we know)?\n(c)\nThe relation of things in themselves to appearances. Is\nthe appearance/thing in itself distinction an ontological one between\ntwo different kinds of objects? If not, is it a distinction between\ntwo aspects of one and the same kind of object? Or perhaps an\nadverbial distinction between two different ways of considering the\nsame objects?\n\n\nSections 2\u20136 examine various influential interpretations of\ntranscendental idealism, focusing on their consequences for\n(a)\u2013(c). Section 7 is devoted more narrowly to the nature of\nthings in themselves, topic (b), and the related Kantian notions:\nnoumena, and the transcendental object. The primary focus\nwill be the Critique of Pure Reason itself; while\ntranscendental idealism, arguably, plays an equally crucial role in\nthe other Critiques, discussing them would take us too far\nafield into Kant\u2019s ethics, aesthetics, and\n teleology.[2]\n While transcendental idealism is a view both about space and\ntime, and thus of objects of outer sense as well as inner sense (my\nown mental states), this entry will focus on Kant\u2019s views about\nspace and outer objects. Kant\u2019s transcendental idealist theory\nof time is too intimately tied up with his theory of the self, and the\nargument of the transcendental deduction, to discuss here (see\nFalkenstein 1991; Van Cleve 1999: 52\u201361; and Dunlop 2009 for\nmore on Kant\u2019s theory of time).\n\nBefore discussing the details of different interpretations, though, it\nwill be helpful if readers have an overview of some relevant texts and\nsome sense of their prima facie meaning. The interpretation\nof these texts offered in this section is provisional; later, we will\nsee powerful reasons to question whether it is correct. Since some\nscholars claim there is a change in Kant\u2019s doctrine from the A\nedition of 1781 to the B edition of 1787, we will begin by restricting\nattention to the A edition.\n Section 2.4\n discusses what relevance the changes made in the B edition have for\nthe interpretation of transcendental idealism. However, following\nstandard scholarly practice, for passages present in both editions,\nthe A page number followed by the B page number is given (e.g.,\nA575/B603). Works other than the Critique are cited by volume\nin the \u201cAcademy\u201d edition of Kant\u2019s work (Ak.),\nfollowed by the page number. At the end of this article can be found a\nguide to all the editions and translations of Kant used in its\npreparation.\n",
