    "main_text": "\n\n\nAnalysis has always been at the heart of philosophical method, but it\nhas been understood and practised in many different ways. Perhaps, in\nits broadest sense, it might be defined as a process of isolating or \nworking back to what is more fundamental by means of which something,\ninitially taken as given, can be explained or reconstructed. The \nexplanation or reconstruction is often then exhibited in a \ncorresponding process of synthesis. This allows great variation in \nspecific method, however. The aim may be to get back to basics, but \nthere may be all sorts of ways of doing this, each of which might be \ncalled \u2018analysis\u2019. The dominance of \n\u2018analytic\u2019 philosophy in the English-speaking world, and \nincreasingly now in the rest of the world, might suggest that a \nconsensus has formed concerning the role and importance of analysis. \nThis assumes, though, that there is agreement on what \n\u2018analysis\u2019 means, and this is far from clear. On the \nother hand, Wittgenstein's later critique of analysis in the \nearly (logical atomist) period of analytic philosophy, and \nQuine's attack on the analytic-synthetic distinction, for \nexample, have led some to claim that we are now in a \n\u2018post-analytic\u2019 age. Such criticisms, however, are only \ndirected at particular conceptions of analysis. If we look at the \nhistory of philosophy, and even if we just look at the history of \nanalytic philosophy, we find a rich and extensive repertoire of \nconceptions of analysis which philosophers have continually drawn \nupon and reconfigured in different ways. Analytic philosophy is alive\nand well precisely because of the range of conceptions of analysis \nthat it involves. It may have fragmented into various interlocking \nsubtraditions, but those subtraditions are held together by both \ntheir shared history and their methodological interconnections. It is\nthe aim of this article to indicate something of the range of \nconceptions of analysis in the history of philosophy and their \ninterconnections, and to provide a bibliographical resource for those\nwishing to explore analytic methodologies and the philosophical \nissues that they raise.\n",
