    "main_text": "Beauty || Hippias Major\n1.1 Hippias Major\n\nFor a long time scholars treated the Hippias Major as a\nspurious dialogue. Today most agree that Plato wrote it, and its\nsustained inquiry into beauty is seen as central to Platonic\naesthetics.\n\nThe Hippias Major follows Socrates and the Sophist Hippias\nthrough a sequence of attempts to define to kalon. Socrates\nbadgers Hippias, in classic Socratic ways, to identify beauty\u2019s\ngeneral nature; Hippias offers three definitions. Quite preposterously\nfor instance \u201ca beautiful young woman is beautiful\u201d\n(287e). Hippias had a reputation for the breadth of his factual\nknowledge. He compiled the first list of Olympic victors, and he might\nhave written the first history of philosophy. But his over-ingestion\nof specifics has evidently left him unable to digest his experience\nand generalize to a philosophical definition.\n\nAfter Hippias fails, Socrates tries three definitions. These are\ngeneral but they fail too, and\u2014again in classic Socratic\nmode\u2014the dialogue ends unresolved. In one excursus Socrates says\nbeauty \u201cis appropriate [prepei]\u201d and proposes\ndefining it as \u201cwhat is appropriate [to prepon]\u201d\n(290d). Although ending in refutation this discussion (to 294e) is\nworth a look as the anticipation of a modern debate. Philosophers of\nthe eighteenth century argue over whether an object is beautiful by\nsatisfying the definition of the object, or independently of that\ndefinition (Guyer 1993). Kant calls the beauty that is appropriateness\n\u201cdependent beauty\u201d (Critique of Judgment, section\n16). Such beauty threatens to become a species of the good. Within the\naccepted corpus of genuine Platonic works beauty is never subsumed\nwithin the good, the appropriate, or the beneficial; Plato seems to\nbelong in the same camp as Kant in this respect. (On Platonic beauty\nand the good see Barney 2010.) Nevertheless, and of course, he is no\nsimple sensualist about beauty either. The very temptation in Plato to\nlink the beautiful with the good and to assess it intellectually is\npart of why Porter calls him and Aristotle \u201cformalists,\u201d\nwho diverted ancient theorizing about art from its sensualist origins\n(Porter 2010).\n\nDespite its inconclusiveness the Hippias Major reflects the\nview of beauty found in other dialogues:\n\nBeauty behaves as canonical Platonic Forms do. It possesses the\nreality that Forms have and is discovered through the same dialectic\nthat brings other Forms to light. Socrates wants Hippias to explain\nthe property that is known when any examples of beauty are known\n(essence of beauty), the cause of all occurrences of\nbeauty, and more precisely the cause not of the appearance of beauty\nbut of its real being (286d, 287c, 289d, 292c, 294e,\n297b).\nNevertheless beauty is not just any Form. It bears some close\nrelationship to the good (296d), even though Socrates argues that the\ntwo are distinct (296e ff., 303e ff.). It is therefore a Form of some\nstatus above that of other Forms.\nSocrates and Hippias appeal to artworks as examples of beautiful\nthings but do not treat those as central cases (290a\u2013b,\n297e\u2013298a). So too generally Plato conducts his inquiry into\nbeauty at a distance from his discussion of art. (But the\nRepublic and the Laws both contain exceptions to\nthis generalization: Lear 2010, 361.) \n\n\nThese three aspects of Platonic beauty work together and reflect\nbeauty\u2019s unique place in Plato\u2019s metaphysics, something almost both\nvisible and intelligible.\n",
