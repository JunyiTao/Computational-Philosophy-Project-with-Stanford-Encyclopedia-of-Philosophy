Five Conditions Often Proposed as Necessary for Candidacy for Voluntary Euthanasia\n\nAdvocates of voluntary euthanasia typically contend that if a\nperson\n\nis suffering from a terminal illness;\nis unlikely to benefit from the discovery of a cure for that\nillness during what remains of her life expectancy;\nis, as a direct result of the illness, either suffering\nintolerable pain, or only has available a life that is unacceptably\nburdensome (e.g., because the illness has to be treated in ways that\nlead to her being unacceptably dependent on others or on technological\nmeans of life support);\nhas an enduring, voluntary and competent wish to die (or has,\nprior to losing the competence to do so, expressed a wish to be\nassisted to die in the event that conditions (a)-(c) are satisfied);\nand\nis unable without assistance to end her life,\n\n\nthen there should be legal and medical provision to facilitate her\nbeing allowed to die or assisted to die.\n\nIt should be acknowledged that these conditions are quite restrictive,\nindeed more restrictive than many think appropriate. In particular,\nthe first condition restricts access to voluntary euthanasia to those\nwho are terminally ill. While that expression is not free of\nall ambiguity, for present purposes it can be agreed that it does not\ninclude those who are rendered quadriplegic as a result of accidents,\nor sufferers from motor neurone disease, or individuals who succumb to\nforms of dementia like Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, to say nothing of\nthose afflicted by \u2018existential suffering\u2019. Those who\nconsider that cases like these show the first condition to be too\nrestrictive (e.g., Varelius 2014) may, nonetheless, agree that\nincluding them as candidates for legalized voluntary euthanasia is\nlikely to make it far harder in many jurisdictions to gain sufficient\nsupport for legalization (and so to make it harder to help those\nterminally ill persons who wish to die). Even so, they believe that\nvoluntary euthanasia should be permitted for those who consider their\nlives no longer worth living, not just for for the terminally ill. The\nfifth condition further restricts access to voluntary euthanasia by\nexcluding those capable of ending their own lives, and so may be\nthought unduly restrictive by those who would wish to discourage\nterminally ill patients from attempting suicide. There will be yet\nothers who consider this condition to be too restrictive because\ncompetent patients can always refuse nutrition and hydration (see,\ne.g., Bernat, et al., 1993; Savulescu 2014). Though this is true, many\ncompetent dying persons still wish to have access to legalized\nmedically assisted death, rather than having to rely on refusing\nnutrition and hydration, so that they may retain control over the\ntiming of their deaths and avoid needlessly prolonging the process of\ndying.\n\nThe second condition is intended simply to reflect the fact that it is\nnormally possible to say when someone\u2019s health status is\nincurable. So-called \u2018miracle\u2019 cures may be proclaimed by\nsensationalist journalists, but progress toward medical breakthroughs\nis typically painstaking. If there are miracles wrought by God that\nwill be quite another matter entirely, but it is at least clear that\nnot everyone\u2019s death is thus to be staved off.\n\nThe third condition recognises what many who oppose the legalization\nof voluntary euthanasia do not, namely, that it is not only a desire\nto be released from pain that leads people to request help with dying.\nIn The Netherlands, for example, pain has been found to be a less\nsignificant reason for requesting assistance with dying than other\nforms of suffering like frustration over loss of independence (see\ne.g., Marquet, et al., 2003; Onwuteaka-Philipsen, et al., 2012;\nEmanuel, et al., 2016). Sufferers from some terminal conditions may\nhave their pain relieved but have to endure side effects that, for\nthem, make life unbearable. Others may not have to cope with pain but,\ninstead, with having to rely on forms of life support that\nsimultaneously rob their lives of quality (as with, e.g., motor\nneurone disease). Yet others struggle with psychological distress and\nvarious psychiatric conditions and believe these conditions ought to\nbe counted among the forms of suffering that qualify competent\nindividuals to access medical assistance with dying. There has been\ngreater recognition of, and support for, this position in The\nNetherlands and Belgium than elsewhere, probably because legislation\nin those jurisdictions makes the role of unbearable suffering central\nto the determination of the eligibility of competent individuals for\nmedical assistance with dying. Even so, inclusion of these forms of\nsuffering highlights legitimate issues to do with the competence of at\nleast some of those who suffer from them. (For a helpful recent study\nof the handling of requests for assistance with dying by psychiatric\npatients in The Netherlands see Kim, et al., 2016.)\n\nA final preliminary point is that the fourth condition requires that\nthe choice to die not only be uncoerced and competent but that it be\nenduring. The choice is one that will require time for reflection,\nand, almost certainly, discussion with others, so should not be\nsettled in a moment. Nonetheless, as with other decisions affecting\nmatters of importance, adults are presumed to choose voluntarily and\nto be competent unless the presence of defeating considerations can be\nestablished. (See the entry on\n decision-making capacity.)\n The burden of proof of establishing lack of voluntariness, or lack of\ncompetence, is on those who refuse to accept an adult person\u2019s\nchoice. There is no need to deny that this burden can sometimes be met\n(e.g., by pointing to the person\u2019s being in a state of clinical\ndepression). The claim is only that the onus falls on those who assert\nthat an adult\u2019s choice is not competent.\n\nClearly the five conditions set out above are likely to require some\nrefinement if complete agreement is to be reached but there is\nsufficient agreement for us to proceed without further ado to\nconsideration of the cases for and against legalization of voluntary\neuthanasia. (However, for a fuller discussion of issues concerning the\ndefinition of \u2018euthanasia\u2019 see, e.g., Beauchamp and\nDavidson 1979.)\n",
