    "main_text": "Motivations for Dialetheism || A Simple Case Study: the Liar\n3.2 A Simple Case Study: the Liar\n\nIn its standard version, the Liar paradox arises by reasoning on the\nfollowing sentence:\n\n(1): (1) is false \n\nwhere the number to the left is the name of the sentence to the right.\nAs we can see, (1) refers to itself and tells us something about (1)\nitself. Its truth value? Let us reason by cases. Suppose (1) is true:\nthen what it says is the case, so it is false. Then, suppose (1) is\nfalse: this is what it claims to be, so it is true. If we accept the\naforementioned Law of Bivalence, that is, the principle according to\nwhich all sentences are either true or false, both alternatives lead\nto a contradiction: (1) is both true and false, that is, a dialetheia,\ncontrary to the LNC.\n\nThe paradox can also be produced without any direct self-reference,\nbut via a short-circuit of sentences. For instance, here is a looped\nLiar:\n\n(2a): (2b) is true\n\n(2b): (2a) is false\n\nIf what (2a) says is true, then (2b) is true. However, (2b) says that\n(2a) is false \u2026. And so on: we are in a paradoxical loop. This\nis as old as Buridan (his Sophism no. 9: Plato saying \u2018What\nSocrates says is true\u2019; Socrates replying \u2018What Plato\nsays is false\u2019). \n\nParadoxes of this kind have been known since antiquity (the standard\nLiar is attributed to the Greek philosopher Eubulides, probably the\ngreatest paradox-producer of antiquity). But they were thrown into\nprominence by developments in the foundations of mathematics around\nthe turn of the twentieth century. In the case of each paradox, there\nappears to be a perfectly sound argument ending in a contradiction. If\nthe arguments are sound, then dialetheism is true. Of course, many\nhave argued that the soundness of such arguments is merely an\nappearance, and that subtle fallacies may be diagnosed in them. Such\nsuggestions were made in ancient and medieval logic; but many more\nhave been made in modern logic\u2014indeed, attacking the paradoxes\nhas been something of a leitmotiv of modern logic. And one\nthing that appears to have come out of this is how resilient the\nparadoxes are: attempts to solve them often simply succeed in\nrelocating the paradoxes elsewhere, as so called\n\u2018strengthened\u2019 forms of the arguments show. Let us have a\nlook.\n\nA radical solution, which never won big consensus but has been\nrevitalised in recent times (Pleitz 2018), has it that there just\ncannot be meaningful self-rererential sentences. Various works\n(notably Martin 1967, van Fraassen 1968, Kripke 1975, Field 2008) have\nproposed to solve the Liar paradox by dismissing Bivalence, whereby\nsome sentences are neither true nor false, and the Liar is one such\ntruth value \u2018gap\u2019. Truth value gaps, and the inclusion of\nthe Liar among them, are differently motivated in the various\napproaches. But the common core thought is the following: even though\nthe Liar is a sentence such that, if it were true, it would be false,\nand vice versa, no explicit contradiction according to which\nit is both true and false need follow. We can avoid the contradiction\nby rejecting the idea that truth and falsity are the only two options\nfor a sentence: the Liar is neither. For a comparative survey of the\ntwo kinds of approach, see Beall and Ripley 2018.\n\nThese approaches face difficulties with the so-called\n\u2018strengthened\u2019 Liars\u2014sentences such as the\nfollowing:\n\n(3): (3) is not true.\n\n(4): (4) is false or neither true nor false.\n\nNow these sentences should be, on the gappy theorist\u2019s\nnon-bivalent approach, either true, or false, or neither. But, for\ninstance, if (3) is true, then things are as it claims they are;\ntherefore, (3) is not true (either false or truth-valueless). If (3)\nis false, or neither true nor false, in both cases it is not true; but\nthis is precisely what it claims to be; therefore, it is true. We seem\nto have to conclude that (3) is both true and not true, contrary to\nthe LNC. A similar line of reasoning goes for (4).\n\nAccording to Priest the strengthened Liars show that a single feature\nof the semantic paradox underlies its different formulations. The\ntotality of sentences is divided into two subsets: the true ones, and\ntheir \u2018bona fide complement\u2019\u2014call it the\nRest. Now the essence of the liar is \u201ca particular\ntwisted construction which forces a sentence, if it is in the bona\nfide truths, to be in the Rest (too); conversely, if it is in the\nRest, it is in the bona fide truths\u201d (Priest 1987, p. 23). The\nstandard Liar, \u2018This sentence is false\u2019, is just a\nparticular instance of this, producing a contradiction within the\nbivalent framework, in which the Rest is identified with the set of\nthe false sentences. We can try to resolve the problem by admitting\nsentences that are neither true nor false, so that the false ones\nbecome a proper subset of the Rest. However, the strengthened Liars\nshow that we can use the notions introduced to solve the previous\nparadox to re-describe the Rest. Once the set of sentences is\npartitioned into a trichotomy (true, false, and neither true nor\nfalse), the disjunctive \u2018This sentence is false or neither true\nnor false\u2019 embraces the whole Rest, i.e. the new(ly described)\ncomplement of the set of the true sentences. What about adding more\nvalues? If there is some fourth thing that a sentence can be, besides\ntrue, false, and neither true nor false, we can always take the notion\nfourth thing and produce another strengthened Liar:\n\n(5): (5) is false, or neither true nor false, or the fourth thing.\n\n\nSee Kirkham 1992, pp. 293\u20134. These strengthened liars are also\ncalled revenge liars, and the general phenomenon we have just\nwitnessed has become known as revenge; see Beall 2007, e.g.\nthe introduction, and Cook 2007, among other essays. \n\nThere is no generally agreed upon solution to the semantic paradoxes.\nOne typical way out attempted by the supporters of truth value gaps,\nfor instance, consists in denying that the notion of gap, or\ndefective sentence, or sentence whose truth value is\nindeterminate, can be fully expressed in the language for which\nthey are proposing their theory of truth. The strengthened paradoxes\nthen seem to force the consistent theorist to admit that the proposed\ntheory was formulated in a language different from, and expressively\nmore powerful than, the one whose semantics it was supposed to\nexpress. This entails a limitation of the Tarskian T-schema\ncharacterising truth, i.e., of the equivalence \n\\[\nTr\\langle A\\rangle \\leftrightarrow A\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \u2018\\(Tr\\)\u2019 is the truth predicate for the relevant\nlanguage, and \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) is the appropriate name of sentence\n\\(A\\). This approach makes a rigid distinction between an object\nlanguage and its metalanguage. Such a distinction was introduced by\nTarski to expel the Liar paradox from formalized languages\u2014but\nTarski himself insisted that his solution is inapplicable to natural\nlanguages, which do not appear to depend upon some metalanguage for\ntheir semantics. As Kripke admits at the end of Outline of a\nTheory of Truth, \u201cthe ghost of the Tarski hierarchy is\nstill with us\u201d (scil. the paracompletists: see Kripke 1975, p.\n80).\n\nTarski, in short, identified the cause of the semantic paradoxes to be\nsemantic closure\u2014the fact that natural languages such\nas English satisfy the T-schema. Tarski took this to mean that there\ncan be no consistent formalization of a semantically complete\nlanguage, only a approximation thereof stratified into metalanguages.\nDialetheists agree, but draw the conclusion in the other direction:\nthe appropriate formalization of a language such as ours, because it\nis semantically closed and is not hierarchically stratified, will be\ninconsistent (Priest 1987, ch.1, Beall 2009, ch.1).\n\nThese two features\u2014a claimed immunity to revenge/strengthened\nliars, and dispensing with the object-language/metalanguage\ndistinction\u2014are argued to give dialetheism about the paradoxes\nof self-reference some of its major appeal. As Shapiro (in a critical\nnote) puts it, dialetheists offer that we\n\ndo not need to keep running through richer and richer meta-languages\nin order to chase our semantic tails.\u2026 We embrace some\ncontradictions in the semantics, and get it all from the start\n(Shapiro 2002, p. 818).\n\n\nThe simplicity of a dialetheic theory of truth, then, is\nclaimed as an additional further feature. The two most prominent such\ntheories to date are presented in Priest 1987, and Beall 2009. In the\nformer, the truth predicate \\(Tr\\) for the relevant formal language,\nmodelling the behaviour of truth in English, is simply characterized\nby the unrestricted T-schema, \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\leftrightarrow\nA\\), which, as stressed by many philosophers, is an overwhelmingly\nintuitive\u2014perhaps even analytic\u2014principle concerning\ntruth. It is admitted that some sentences\u2014notably, the\nLiars\u2014are truth value gluts, that is, both true and false (the\nconstruction may also sustain sentences which are both true and not\ntrue, although not all dialetheias need be of this kind); and no\nhierarchy of metalanguages or further epicycles are needed.\n\nBeall\u2019s 2009 theory allows a fully transparent truth\npredicate: one such that for any sentence \\(A\\), \\(Tr\\langle\nA\\rangle\\) and \\(A\\) can be replaced with each other in all\n(non-opaque) contexts salva veritate, that is, producing\nsentences logically equivalent to the sentences one started with. Then\nthe unrestricted T-schema follows from transparency (and the fact that\n\\(A \\rightarrow A\\) is a logical truth) as a special case. In\nBeall\u2019s theory, all sentences \\(A\\) that are\ndialetheias are not only true and false, i.e. (given that falsity is\ntruth of negation), \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\wedge Tr\\langle \\neg\nA\\rangle\\); they are also true and untrue, \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\wedge\n\\neg Tr\\langle A\\rangle\\): this again follows from the transparency of\ntruth. Beall\u2019s theory is based on a (relevant) paraconsistent\nlogic, whose modal semantics employs so-called\n non-normal worlds.\n \n\nOverall, such paradoxes as the Liar provide some evidence for the\ndialetheist\u2019s claim that some contradictions are\nprovably true, in the sense that they are entailed by plain\nfacts concerning natural language and our thought processes. Extended\nLiar paradoxes like \u2018This sentence is not true\u2019 are spelt\nin ordinary English. Their paradoxical characteristics, dialetheists\nargue, are due exactly to the intuitive features of ordinary language:\nunavoidable self-reference; the failure of metalinguistic hierarchies,\nwhich only produce languages that are expressively weaker than\nEnglish; and the obvious presence of a truth predicate for English,\n\u2018is true\u2019, which is characterized, at least extensionally,\nby either the Tarskian T-schema or rules amounting to the transparency\nof truth. For a sustained critical engagement with paraconsistent\ndialetheism as a solution to the semantic paradoxes, see Field 2008,\npart 5 (chapters 23\u201326).\n",
