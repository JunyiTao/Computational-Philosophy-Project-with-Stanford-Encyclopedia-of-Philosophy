    "main_text": "Theology || Foreknowledge and Contingency\n3.1 Foreknowledge and Contingency\n\nGregory\u2019s treatment of divine foreknowledge and future\ncontingents is aimed primarily at Peter Auriol and secondarily at\nOxford theologians (Vignaux 1934, ch. 4; Hoenen 1993, 196\u2013214;\nSchabel 2000, 264\u2013274; Fiorentino 2004; Ciammetti 2011). In\norder to preserve the contingency of events stemming from human free\nwill, Auriol claimed that propositions about future contingents are\nneither true nor false, but rather neutral, and so God does not know\nthat the Antichrist will exist, since \u201cthe Antichrist will\nexist\u201d is neither true nor false. Although like Ockham and\nRimini later, Auriol maintained that exactly how God knows the future\nis incomprehensible to us, he did give a sophisticated explanation and\ndefense of God\u2019s knowledge of our future. Gregory, however,\nchose to focus on the above-mentioned elements in Auriol\u2019s\nposition. Gregory recognized that Auriol\u2019s theory of\nfuture-contingent propositions relies on Aristotle\u2019s stance in\nchapter 9 of On Interpretation. Interestingly, although\nGregory denied the truth of the position itself, he nevertheless held\nthat it was in fact Aristotle\u2019s. Indeed he rejected any attempt\nto interpret Aristotle differently, in the way that many medieval and\nmodern philosophers have tried to do:\n\n[This] is apparently a friendly excuse, but in truth it is more of an\naccusation, because the fact that absurdities ensue [from this\nposition] does not convince us that [Aristotle] did not think that,\nbut convinces us that he ought not to have thought that... Moreover,\nsome modern theologians [i.e., Auriol], great teachers, said that the\nconclusion [denying determinate truth to future-contingent\npropositions] not only was the Philosopher\u2019s intention, but also\nthat it is very true and even demonstrated... (Rimini 1979, 243).\n\n\nSo for Gregory, Auriol was correct that Aristotle denied the Principle\nof Bivalence when applied to propositions about future\ncontingents.\n\nAuriol set up two basic rules for such propositions: (1) if a\nproposition about the future, say, \u201cSocrates will run,\u201d is\ntrue, it is true immutably and inevitably, since no instant can be\nfound when it would be false. (2) The significate of such a\nproposition will inevitably and necessarily be put into being. The\nfoundation for Auriol\u2019s claim is his modal theory: immutability\nand necessity are the same thing. If something is immutable, it cannot\nbe different from what it is, and so it necessarily is the way it\nis.\n\nGregory answered with a rigorous and lengthy defense of Bivalence and\nan alternative modal theory. His defense of Bivalence includes a\ndetailed set of rules for propositions. It is significant that this\nsection of Gregory\u2019s text, some seven pages, stems from Francis\nof Marchia\u2019s refutation of Auriol\u2019s position, a refutation\nadopted and extended by Gregory\u2019s own Augustinian predecessor at\nParis, Michael of Massa. In short, Gregory argued that the Principle\nof Bivalence applies universally, and Aristotle was wrong to make an\nexception in the case of future-contingent propositions. Although this\nwas his basic disagreement with Auriol, Gregory was so careful a\nphilosopher that before he refuted Auriol on this point he corrected\nhis Franciscan predecessor on details and in so doing made\nAuriol\u2019s own theory more precise.\n\nAuriol placed greater emphasis on divine simplicity and necessity than\non divine freedom and contingency when he was wrestling with one of\nthe fundamental problems of Christian philosophical theology: given an\nabsolutely simple and necessary God, what is the source of\ncontingency? Auriol\u2019s own explanation lies in God\u2019s\nrelationship with events in time, but this explanation was not of\ninterest to Rimini, who was convinced by Scriptural prophecy that God\ndoes in fact know the future, and convinced by logic that the\nPrinciple of Bivalence holds universally. So the problem becomes, if\nGod knows that Socrates will run, and the proposition \u201cSocrates\nwill run\u201d is true, will not Socrates run necessarily?\n\nRimini\u2019s answer is a version of the opinio communis, a\nposition with roots in Scotus and the Parisian tradition but which\nOckham and later Oxford scholars refined with their focus on\npropositions. (It is possible that Ockham was influenced by Auriol in\nhis concentration on future-contingent propositions, as some have\nheld, but there is nothing specific to indicate that Ockham knew\nAuriol\u2019s treatment, and after Scotus it was natural for\ntheologians to focus their attention on the truth of future-contingent\npropositions anyway.) The opinio communis relies on\nGod\u2019s freedom to save contingency in the world: everything other\nthan God is ultimately contingent, because God wills and acts freely\nand contingently in creating, and so it is logically possible for the\nthings in the world not to have been or to have been otherwise. At the\nsame time, the common position affirms God\u2019s immutability and\ndeterminate knowledge of such things. The upshot is that true\npropositions about future contingents have always been true and are\nimmutably true, even determinately true, but that they are only\ncontingently true and not necessarily so. So Gregory denies\nAuriol\u2019s equation of necessity and immutability.\n\nGregory\u2019s position relies on interesting uses of common logical\ndevices and distinctions developed at Paris and Oxford over the\npreceding century, such as the distinction between the composite and\ndivided senses of propositions, and that between conditional and\nabsolute necessity. The purpose of these distinctions was to offer a\nway of explaining the contingency of events, but in doing so they\nassumed the ultimate contingency of everything except God. However,\nfar from being an affirmation of the \u201cradical contingency\u201d\nof the world, as some historians have claimed, it was in fact the only\nway for most theologians to save at least some contingency from the\nthreat of absolute logical and divine determinism. In fact, Gregory\nand others admitted that, assuming God\u2019s knowledge of the\nfuture, the future was necessary ex suppositione, although\nnot absolutely, because it is logically possible for immutable God to\nknow otherwise. Peter Auriol, and later Peter de Rivo, Pietro\nPomponazzi, and Martin Luther, would consider these efforts feeble and\ndeluded. The three Peters resorted to alternative theories that others\nconsidered equally feeble and deluded, whereas Luther simply accepted\nthe conclusion that all attempts to save meaningful contingency\ngoverned by human free will were doomed to failure.\n\nWhat is interesting about Gregory\u2019s treatment, again, is not his\noriginality, but the clarity and precision with which he presented the\ncommon position. He even pointed out problems in the discussions of\nthose with whom he broadly agreed, such as Ockham. True, almost all of\nwhat Rimini said could be found in Marchia, Massa, Ockham, Landulph\nCaracciolo, Adam Wodeham, and others, but not in such an organized\nfashion.\n\nOne final element of Gregory\u2019s stance on modal matters that\ndeserves our attention is the contingency or necessity of the past.\nThe opinio communis maintained that the past is somehow\nnecessary in a strong sense, even though it is not absolutely\nnecessary. It seems that Gregory did not go so far as to say that the\npast is necessary (beyond the normal necessity ex\nsuppositione), but he does make some sort of modal distinction\nbetween the past and the future. Thus we can say that Gregory did not\nthink God can change the past, although there has been some\ndisagreement on this issue (Courtenay 1972\u201373; Schabel 2000,\n271\u20132). Suffice it to say that the time has come for a long and\ncareful treatment of the modal status of the past in medieval thought,\nto determine whether any thinker ever really thought the past could be\nchanged. The probable answer is negative.\n",
