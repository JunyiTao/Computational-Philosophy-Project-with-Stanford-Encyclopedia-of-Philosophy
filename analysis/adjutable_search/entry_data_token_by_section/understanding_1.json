    "main_text": "Contexts || Ancient Philosophy\n1.1 Ancient Philosophy\n\nThe ancient Greek word episteme is at the root of our\ncontemporary word \u201cepistemology\u201d, and among philosophers\nit has been common to translate episteme simply as\n\u201cknowledge\u201d (see, e.g., Parry 2003 [2020]).\n\nFor the last several decades, however, a case has been made that\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d is a better translation of\nepisteme. (For early influential arguments see, e.g.,\nMoravscik 1979; Burnyeat 1980, 1981; Annas 1981.) To appreciate why,\nnote that knowledge, as now commonly conceived, can apparently be\nquite easy to get. Thus it seems I can know a proposition such as\nthat it is raining outside just by opening my eyes. It also\nseems that items of knowledge can be in principle isolated or\natomistic. I can therefore apparently know that it is raining while\nknowing very little about other things, such as why it is raining, or\nwhat constitutes rain, or when it will stop.\n\nUnderstanding seems to be different than knowledge in both respects.\nFor one thing, understanding typically seems harder to acquire, and\nmore of an epistemic accomplishment, than knowledge (Pritchard 2010).\nFor another, the objects of understanding seem more structured and\ninterconnected (Zagzebski 2019). Thus the subject matters we try to\nunderstand are often highly complex (quantum mechanics, the U.S. Civil\nWar), and even when we try to understand isolated events (such as the\nspilling of my coffee cup), we typically do so by drawing connections\nwith other events (such as the jostling of the table by my knee).\n\nWith contrasts such as these in mind, it has seemed to several\nscholars of Ancient philosophy that episteme has more in\ncommon with what we would now call \u201cunderstanding\u201d than\nwhat we would now call \u201cknowledge\u201d. Thus Julia Annas notes\nthat, for Plato, the person with episteme has a\nsystematic understanding of things, and is not a mere\npossessor of various truths (Annas 1981: ch. 10). Jonathan Lear\nsimilarly claims that for Aristotle,\n\n\nTo have episteme one must not only know a thing, one must\nalso grasp its cause or explanation. This is to understand it: to know\nin a deep sense what it is and how it has come to be. (Lear 1988:\n6)\n\n\nGranted, what Greek philosophers had in mind by episteme\noften does not fully align with our contemporary ideas about\nunderstanding, because in the hands of philosophers such as Plato and\nAristotle episteme is an exceptionally high-grade epistemic\naccomplishment. For Plato, full episteme seems to require a\ngrasp of the basic elements of reality\u2014in its most complete\nform, a grasp that traces back to the Form of the Good itself (Schwab\n2016, 2020; Moss 2020). For Aristotle, it seems to require an\nappreciation of the deductive relationships that allegedly hold\nbetween natures or first principles and observable phenomena (Burnyeat\n1981). In our contemporary use, by contrast, we often happily ascribe\nunderstanding to quite low-grade cases, where forms or first\nprinciples do not seem to be grasped or even relevant\u2014as when we\ntake ourselves to understand why the coffee cup spilled. Still, with\nits stress on systematicity and interconnectedness, episteme\nplausibly has more in common with our contemporary concept\nunderstanding than our contemporary concept\nknowledge.\n\nIf an understanding-like state was of fundamental epistemic importance\nto the Greeks, it is interesting to ask why the focus of epistemology\nshifted over time, and why an interest in knowledge, especially\npropositional knowledge, came to predominate\u2014including and maybe\nespecially quite isolated bits of propositional knowledge, such as\nthat I am sitting in front of a fire, or that I have two\nhands.\n\nPerhaps the shift occurred in response to the rise of scepticism in\nHellenistic philosophy (Burnyeat 1980: 188; cf. Zagzebski 2001: 236).\nOr perhaps the modern focus on propositional knowledge was a response\nto the wars of religion in sixteenth and seventeenth century Europe,\nwhere it became increasingly important to distinguish good knowledge\nclaims from bad, even with respect to quite isolated claims. (For more\non the modern rise of interest in propositional knowledge, see Pasnau\n2010; 2017.) Regardless of why the shift occurred, a desire to grasp\n\u201chow things hang together\u201d undoubtedly remained a part of\nthe human condition. It is therefore unsurprising that a move to\nrevive understanding as a topic of philosophical inquiry eventually\nemerged.\n",
