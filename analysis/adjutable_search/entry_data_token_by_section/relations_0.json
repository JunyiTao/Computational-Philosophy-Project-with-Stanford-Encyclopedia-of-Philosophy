Preliminary Distinctions\n\nTo understand the contemporary debate about relations we will need to\nhave some logical and philosophical distinctions in place. These\ndistinctions aren\u2019t to be taken for granted. Part of the\ndevelopment of the debate has consisted in the refinement of precisely\nthese distinctions. But you need to understand how, relatively\nspeaking, things got started.\n\nTo begin let\u2019s distinguish between the \u201cdegree\u201d or\n\u201cadicity\u201d or \u201carity\u201d of relations (see, e.g.,\nArmstrong 1978b: 75). Properties are \u201cone-place\u201d or\n\u201cmonadic\u201d or \u201cunary\u201d because properties are\nonly exhibited by particulars or other items, e.g., properties,\nindividually or one by one. Relations are \u201cmany-place\u201d or\n\u201c\\(n\\)-adic\u201d or \u201c\\(n\\)-ary\u201d (where \\(n\\gt 1)\\)\nbecause they are exhibited by particulars only in relation to other\nparticulars. A \u201c2-place\u201d or \u201cdyadic\u201d or\n\u201cbinary\u201d relation is exhibited by one particular only in\nrelation to another. A \u201c3-place\u201d or \u201ctriadic\u201d\nor \u201cternary\u201d relation is exhibited by one particular only\nin relation to exactly two others. And so on. Some examples. The\nrelation that \\(x\\) stands to \\(y\\) whenever \\(x\\) is\nadjacent to \\(y\\) is binary. This is because it takes two\nthings to be adjacent to one another. The relation that \\(x\\) stands\nto \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) whenever \\(x\\) is between \\(y\\) and \\(z\\)\nis ternary because it takes three things for one to fall between the\nother two.\n\nIn these terms, a relation can be distinguished from a\n\u201crelational property\u201d. Whereas a relation is borne by one\nthing to another thing (possibly, in certain cases, to the same\nthing), a relational property is the property of bearing a relation to\nsomething. Suppose \\(a\\) bears a relation \\(R\\) to \\(b\\). Then \\(a\\)\nhas the relational property of bearing \\(R\\) to \\(b\\) whilst \\(b\\) has\nthe property of \\(a\\)\u2019s bearing \\(R\\) to it. Here \\(R\\) is\nbinary whilst the relational properties are unary because they are had\nby single things, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) respectively. For example, marriage\nis a relation between two people but being married to Cleopatra is a\nrelational property had by Antony whilst being married to Antony is a\nrelational property had by Cleopatra.\n\nA \u201cunigrade\u201d relation \\(R\\) is a relation that has a\ndefinite degree or adicity: \\(R\\) is either binary or ternary\u2026\nor \\(n\\)-ary (for some unique \\(n\\)). By contrast a relation is\n\u201cmultigrade\u201d if it fails to be unigrade (the expression is\nowed to Leonard & Goodman 1940: 50). Putative examples include\ncausal, biological, physical, geometrical, intentional and logical\nrelations. Causation appears to be multigrade because a certain number\nof events may be required to bring about an effect on one occasion,\nand a different number of events may be required to bring about an\neffect on another. Similarly, entailment appears to be a multigrade\nrelation because a certain number of premises may be required to\nentail one conclusion but a different number of premises to entail\nanother. Whether there are any multigrade relations and exactly what\nit means to be multigrade is a fraught matter (see Armstrong 1978b:\n93\u20134, 1997: 85, 2010: 23\u20135 and Dixon 2019: 64\u20137 for\narguments against multigrade relations and Morton 1975, Fine 2000: 22,\nMacBride 2005: 569\u201393 and Hossack 2007: 45\u201355 for\narguments in favour of them).\n\nNext, let\u2019s draw a preliminary three-fold distinction between\nbinary relations in terms of their behaviour with respect to the\nthings they relate. A binary relation \\(R\\) is symmetric iff\nwhenever \\(x\\) bears \\(R\\) to \\(y\\), \\(y\\) bears \\(R\\) to \\(x\\). By\ncontrast, \\(R\\) is non-symmetric iff \\(R\\) fails to be\nsymmetric. Asymmetric relations are a special case of\nnon-symmetric ones: R is asymmetric iff whenever \\(x\\) bears \\(R\\) to\n\\(y\\) then \\(y\\) does not bear \\(R\\) to \\(x\\). So whilst all\nasymmetric relations are non-symmetric, not all non-symmetric\nrelations are asymmetric. Some examples. Whenever \\(x\\) is married to\n\\(y\\), \\(y\\) is married to \\(x\\). So the relation in which \\(x\\)\nstands to \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is married to \\(y\\) is a symmetric\nrelation. But if \\(x\\) loves \\(y\\), it isn\u2019t guaranteed that\n\\(y\\) loves \\(x\\). Because, alas, sometimes love is unrequited. So the\nrelation in which \\(x\\) stands to \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) loves \\(y\\) is a\nnon-symmetric relation. But love doesn\u2019t have to go unrequited\notherwise far fewer people would get married, only cynics and gold\ndiggers. So this relation isn\u2019t asymmetric. By contrast, the\nrelation in which \\(x\\) stands to \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is taller than\n\\(y\\) is asymmetric because if \\(x\\) is taller than \\(y\\) then \\(y\\)\nisn\u2019t taller than \\(x\\). This doesn\u2019t exhaust the logical\nclassification of relations. It\u2019s easy to see that further\ndistinctions will need be drawn. Consider, for example, the\nbetween relation. It\u2019s a ternary relation that is\nsymmetric in the sense that if \\(x\\) is between \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) then\n\\(x\\) is between \\(z\\) and \\(y\\). But the between relation\nisn\u2019t completely or strictly symmetric because\nit\u2019s not the case that if \\(x\\) is between \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) then\n\\(y\\) is between \\(x\\) and \\(z\\). So the distinction between symmetric\nand non-symmetric relations for \\(n\\)-ary relations, where \\(n \\gt\n2\\), will need to be qualified. (In what follows we restrict ourselves\nto the more straightforward cases discussed in the philosophical\nliterature on relations. But see Russell 1919: 41\u201352 for a more\nwide-ranging discussion of the logical variety of relations.)\n\nNevertheless, equipped with this three-fold distinction for binary\ndistinction we can now appreciate the significance of one contemporary\ndebate about relations. Our ordinary and scientific views of the world\nare replete with descriptions of things that are non-symmetrically or\nasymmetrically related. For this reason, Russell advocating admitting\nboth non-symmetric and asymmetric relations alongside symmetric ones\n(Russell 1903: \u00a7\u00a7212\u20136, 1914: 58\u20139, 1924: 339).\nBut, more recently, it has been questioned whether it is necessary to\nadmit non-symmetric and asymmetric relations at all, i.e., it has been\nargued that the world contains only symmetric relations by Armstrong\n1997: 143\u20134; Dorr 2004: 180\u20137; Simons 2010: 207\u20131,\nbut for counter-arguments see MacBride 2015: 178\u201394.\n\nNow non-symmetric relations, including asymmetric ones, are typically\ndescribed as imposing an order upon the things they relate; they admit\nof what is also called differential application (Fine 2000:\n8). This means that for any such non-symmetric \\(R\\) there are\nmultiple different ways in which \\(R\\) potentially applies to the\nthings it relates. Why? If the way that loves applies to\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) when \\(a\\) loves \\(b\\) were no different from the way\nthat loves applies to them when \\(b\\) loves \\(a\\), then the\nloves relation couldn\u2019t be non-symmetric, because\notherwise \\(a\\) couldn\u2019t love \\(b\\) without \\(b\\)\u2019s loving\n\\(a\\). So we have to distinguish between the two different ways that\nloves is capable of applying to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Similarly we\ncan distinguish the six different ways that the ternary\nbetween relation potentially applies to three things. By\ncontrast, we\u2019re not required by the same reasoning to\ndistinguish between the different ways in which a (strictly) symmetric\nrelation applies to the things it relates. There\u2019s no\ncorresponding necessity to distinguish the way that the\nadjacency relation applies to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) when \\(a\\) is\nadjacent to \\(b\\) from the way that the adjacency relation applies to\nthem when \\(b\\) is adjacent to \\(a\\) because \\(a\\) cannot be adjacent\nto \\(b\\) without \\(b\\) being adjacent to \\(a\\).\n\nPutting the ideas of the last three paragraphs together, philosophers\noften seek to capture what is distinctive about relations by\ndescribing them in the following manner. Unlike properties, binary\nrelations aren\u2019t exhibited by particulars but by pairs\nof particulars. Similarly ternary universals aren\u2019t exhibited by\nparticulars but by triples of particulars, etc. But, we have\nseen, non-symmetric relations, including asymmetrical ones, are\norder-sensitive. So the pairs, triples, etc., of objects that exhibit\nthese relations must be themselves ordered. It is only ordered pairs,\nordered triples, more generally, \\(n\\)-tuples or sequences that\nexhibit relations (Kim 1973: 222; Chisholm 1996: 53; Loux 1998:\n23).\n\nThere are a number of reasons we should be wary of characterising\nrelations in such quasi-mathematical terms. First, sequences\npresuppose order, the difference between a thing\u2019s coming first\nand thing\u2019s coming second, so cannot be used to explain order\nwithout our going around in a tight circle. Second, it\u2019s\nproblematic to try to explain a relation between two things in terms\nof another thing, a sequence, which is those two things put together\nin an order (MacBride 2005: 590\u20132). If a sequence \\(s\\)\n(\\(=\\langle x, y \\rangle\\)) is conceived as a \u201cone\u201d such\nthat a relation \\(R\\) is really only a monadic feature of it,\n\\(R(s)\\), then it\u2019s mysterious what \\(R\\)\u2019s holding of\n\\(s\\) has to do with \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) being arranged one way rather\nthan another with respect to \\(R\\). If you don\u2019t see the mystery\nstraightaway, reflect that \\(s\\) may have a monadic feature \\(F\\),\nwhich is, so to speak, only to do with \\(s\\) itself rather than its\nmembers. But if \\(R\\) and \\(F\\) are conceived alike, as monadic\nfeatures of \\(s\\), isn\u2019t it mysterious that the possession by\n\\(s\\) of \\(R\\) has consequences for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) whereas \\(F\\)\ndoesn\u2019t? If, alternatively, a sequence is conceived as a\n\u201cmany\u201d, just \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), such that \\(R\\) applies to\nthem directly, then it\u2019s unclear what the appeal to sequences\nhas achieved.\n\nWe cannot avoid the difficulties associated with sequences by\nappealing to the Kuratowski definition of sequences in terms of\nunordered sets (where, e.g., \\(\\langle x, y\\rangle = \\{\\{x\\}, \\{x,\ny\\}\\}\\)) (or Bergmann\u2019s Kuratowski inspired account of order in\nterms of \u2018diads\u2019, see his 1981: 147). There are\nindefinitely many other set-theoretic constructions upon which we may\nrely to model sequences, e.g., Wiener\u2019s, hence the familiar\nobjection that we cannot legitimately fix upon any one such\nconstruction as revelatory of the nature of sequences (see Kitcher\n(1978: 125\u20136) generalising upon a point originally made by\nBenacerraf (1965: 54\u201362)). But there is also the less familiar\nobjection that the Kuratowski definition cannot be used to analyse the\norder inherent in the sequence \\(\\langle x, y\\rangle\\). Compare: we\ncannot analyse personal identity in terms of memory because it\u2019s\nbuilt into the what we mean by memory that you can only remember\nyour own experiences, i.e., the very notion that we set out\nto explain, viz. personal identity, is presupposed by our analysans.\nSimilarly \\(\\{\\{x\\}, \\{x, y\\}\\}\\) only serves as a model of \\(\\langle\nx, y\\rangle\\) relative to the assumption that the thing that belongs\nto a singleton member, namely \\(\\{x\\}\\), of the first class comes\nfirst in the pair \\(\\langle x, y\\rangle\\), so the notion of order\nis presupposed (Hochberg 1981, 2001: 176\u20137).\n\nThe next idea that needs to be introduced is the idea of a\nconverse relation. For any given binary relation \\(R\\), the\nconverse of \\(R\\) may be defined as the relation \\(R^*\\) that \\(x\\)\nbears to \\(y\\) whenever \\(y\\) bears \\(R\\) to \\(x\\) (Fine 2000: 3; van\nInwagen 2006: 459). Note that the relationship between a relation and\nits converse isn\u2019t a matter of happenstance; there\u2019s no\npossibility of a converse of \\(R\\) floating free from \\(R\\) and\nholding between things independently of how \\(R\\) arranges them.\nRather it\u2019s a more intimate relationship which, if it holds,\nholds of necessity. For \\(x\\) to have one to \\(y\\) is, so to speak,\nfor \\(y\\) to have the other to \\(x\\); they neither exist nor can be\nobserved apart from one another but can only be distinguished in\nthought (Geach 1957: 33). Before and after,\nabove and below are prima facie examples of\nmutually converse relations. Non-symmetric relations, including\nasymmetric ones, are distinct from their converses (if they have\nthem). Suppose \\(R\\) is a non-symmetric relation which \\(x\\) bears to\n\\(y.\\) Then the converse of \\(R\\) is borne by \\(y\\) to \\(x\\). But\nsuppose that \\(R\\), as it may, fails to be borne by \\(y\\) to \\(x\\).\nThen something is true of the converse of \\(R\\) that isn\u2019t true\nof \\(R\\) itself, viz. that it is borne by \\(y\\) to \\(x\\).\nHence, the converse of \\(R\\) must be distinct from \\(R\\). More\ngenerally, whilst a binary non-symmetric relation has only one\nconverse, a ternary one has five mutual, distinct converses, a\nquadratic relation has 23 converses, etc. The issue of whether\nrelations have converses is another issue to which we will return\nlater.\n\nThe next distinction we will need, or more accurately, family of\ndistinctions, is between internal and external relations.\nWhat makes them members of a single family is that a relation is\ninternal if its holding between things is somehow fixed by the things\nthemselves or how those things are; external relations are relations\nwhose holding between things isn\u2019t fixed this way. Different\nversions of the internal-external distinction correspond to different\nexplanations of how internal relations are fixed (Ewing 1934:\n118\u201336; Dunn 1990: 188\u2013192; Hakkarainen, Kein\u00e4nen\n& Keskinen, 2019). We don\u2019t need to describe every version\nof the distinction but here are three that are essential to\nunderstanding the contemporary debate.\n\nThe first version of the distinction is owed to Moore. According to\nMoore\u2019s (1919: 47), a binary relation \\(R\\) is internal iff if\n\\(x\\) bears \\(R\\) to \\(y\\) then \\(x\\) does so necessarily. From the\ninternality of \\(R\\), in Moore\u2019s sense, it follows that if \\(x\\)\nexists at all then \\(x\\) indeed bears \\(R\\) to \\(y\\). But if\nit\u2019s possible that \\(x\\) exist whilst failing to bear \\(R\\) to\n\\(y\\), then \\(R\\) is external. The doctrine of the necessity of origin\nprovides one putative example of a relation that\u2019s internal in\nMoore\u2019s sense. If you essentially come from your biological\nparents then you could not have existed whilst failing to be their\noffspring, i.e., the relation of biologically originating\nfrom must be internal in Moore\u2019s sense.\n\nThe second version of the internal-external distinction is favoured by\nArmstrong (1978b: 84\u20135, 1989: 43, 1997: 87\u20139, van Inwagen\n1993: 33\u20134). According to Armstrong, a relation \\(R\\) is\ninternal iff it\u2019s holding between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is\nnecessitated by the intrinsic natures, i.e., non-relational\nproperties, of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\); otherwise \\(R\\) is external. The third\nversion is owed to Lewis. Lewis (1986: 62) advanced the view that an\ninternal relation is one that supervenes upon the intrinsic natures of\nits relata. But Lewis\u2019s definition of \u201cexternal\u201d is\nmore involved: \\(R\\) is external iff (1) it fails to supervene upon\nthe nature of the relata taken separately, but (2) it does supervene\non the nature of the composite of the relata taken together.\n\nSuppose that \\(x\\) is a cube and \\(y\\) is also a cube. It follows that\n\\(x\\) is the same shape as \\(y.\\) So the relation that \\(x\\) bears to\n\\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is the same shape as \\(y\\) is internal in\nArmstrong\u2019s sense. By contrast, spatio-temporal relations are\nexternal (in his sense) because the intrinsic characteristics of \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) don\u2019t necessitate how close or far apart \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are. Lewis intends his distinction to classify the same way. If\n\\(x\\) is the same shape as \\(y\\), but \\(w\\) is not the same shape as\nz, then there must be some difference in intrinsic nature either\nbetween \\(x\\) and \\(w\\) or else between \\(y\\) and \\(z\\). So the\nrelation that \\(x\\) bears to \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is the same shape as\n\\(y\\) is internal in Lewis\u2019s sense. Lewis also claims that the\ndistance between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is an external relation because the\nfollowing conditions are met: (1) \\(x\\) may be closer to \\(y\\) than\n\\(w\\) is to \\(z\\) even though \\(x\\) is an intrinsic duplicate of\n\\(w\\), i.e., shares all and only the same intrinsic characteristics,\nand \\(y\\) an intrinsic duplicate of \\(z\\); (2) the distance between\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) does supervene upon the nature of the composite\n\\(x+y\\). (We\u2019ll return in\n section 3\n to the question whether, as Lewis claims, distance relation supervene\nupon the nature of composites.) But the relation that \\(x\\) bears to\n\\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is the same shape as \\(y\\) isn\u2019t internal in\nMoore\u2019s sense because, let us suppose, \\(x\\) might have been\nspherical whilst \\(y\\) remained a cube; so it doesn\u2019t follow\nfrom the mere fact that \\(x\\) exists that \\(x\\) is the same shape as\n\\(y\\).\n\nThe final distinction, or rather, collection of distinctions, which\nwe\u2019ll introduce here and which needs to be borne in mind when\nconsidering the recent debate on relations, concerns the existence and\nidentity conditions for relations. Since Lewis it has become\ncommonplace to conceive relations as either \u201cabundant\u201d or\n\u201csparse\u201d: according to an abundant conception there is a\nrelation for every arbitrary pair (or triple, or ...) of things\nwhereas according to a sparse conception there are only as many\nrelations as are required to characterise the relational aspects of\nlikeness and difference (Lewis 1986: 61). But this binary distinction\ndoesn\u2019t do justice to the variety of different conceptions of\nthe existence and identity of relations that have been put forward.\nDistinguish, on the one hand, an a posterori view according\nto which relations exist only if they are instantiated and whether\nthey are instantiated is an empirical matter (Armstrong 1978a:\n76\u201377) from, on the other hand, an a priori view\naccording to which their existence is settled by purely logical\nprinciples, for example strong comprehension principles whereby every\nopen formula determines a corresponding property or relation (Zalta\n1988: 46\u20137; Williamson 2013: 226\u20137). Whereas the former\nview might admit space-time separation as a relation (or family of\nrelations) whose instantiation is confirmed by physics, the latter\nwould affirm the existence of a relation corresponding to the open\nformula \u201cx is a much funnier anarchist than\ny\u201d. Between these two extremes are views that allow\nsome relations, for example, relative velocities conceived as\nrelations between different things when one has a certain velocity\nrelative to another, to be uninstantiated for the purposes of\nrounding out scientific theory (Bigelow and Pargetter 1990: 77) and\nviews that allow logically complex relations (RvS, R&S\netc.) insofar as they are built up by logical operations from\nsimple relations (R, S etc.) found in nature (Bealer 1982:\n9\u201310).\n\nThere is a considerable variety of views concerning the identity\nconditions for relations. Distinguish, for example, a\n\u201ccoarse-grained\u201d conception, according to which relations\nare identical just in case they are necessarily equivalent,\ni.e. identical just in case, as a matter of necessity, they\nare exhibited by the same pairs, triples... of things, from a\n\u201cfine-grained\u201d conception, according to which relations\nare identical just in case they have the same analysis in terms of\nsimpler relations (Bealer 1982: 2\u20133, Menzel 1993: 62\u20134).\nAnother approach conceives relations as the same just in case they\nconfer the same causal powers on the pairs, triples... of things\nrelated by them. A further approach to relation identity says that,\nfor example, the dyadic relations R and S are\nidentical if their corresponding relational properties (bearing\nR to a, bearing S to a\netc.) are identical, where properties in general (which,\nrecall, are unary) are identical just in case, according to this view,\nthey are \u201cencodings\u201d of the same \u201cabstract\nobject\u201d. The sense of abstract object here is a specialised one:\nroughly speaking, an abstract object encodes a property by\nencapsulating what it is to exhibit the property in question (Zalta\n1988: 51\u201352). Even though these different conceptions of the\nexistence and identity conditions for relations yield different\nresults in different cases it is important to also bear in mind that\nthey need not invariably be seen as competing. It may be that they\nprovide different notions of relation relevant to different purposes,\nfor example, whether we are interested in relations because of their\nrole in causation, semantics, intentionality and so on (Lewis 1986:\n55\u201359).\n",
