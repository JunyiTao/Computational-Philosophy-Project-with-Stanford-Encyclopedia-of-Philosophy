    "main_text": "Practical reason\u2019s first principles || At the origin of Ought\n2.3 At the origin of Ought\n\nPractical reason, in Aquinas\u2019 view, has both one absolutely\nfirst principle and many truly first principles: ST I-II q.\n94 a. 2. The absolutely first principle is formal and in a sense\ncontentless. Like the logical principle of non-contradiction which\ncontrols all rational thought, it expresses, one might say, the\npressure of reason and is so far from being empty of significance and\nforce that its form may be regarded as the frame, and its normativity\nthe source, for all the normativity of the substantive first\nprinciples and of the moral principles which are inferable from them.\nAquinas articulates it as \u201cGood is to be done and pursued, and\nbad avoided\u201d (ibid.).\n\nThis has often been truncated to (i) \u201cGood is to be done, and\nevil avoided\u201d or even, more drastically, (iia) \u201cDo good\nand avoid evil\u201d or yet more drastically (iib) \u201cAvoid evil\nand seek the good\u201d. But Grisez 1963 gave reason to think these\nabbreviations both exegetically and philosophically unsound. The first\npractical principle is not a command or imperative as (ii) would have\nit, nor is it a moral principle as all these formulae suggest by\nomitting \u201cto be pursued\u201d (see 2.7 below). Both in grammar\nand in propositional content, the principle\u2019s gerundive\n\u201cis-to-be\u201d is neither imperative nor predictive, but\nrationally directive \u2013 an ought \u2013 in the way that\ngets its fully developed and central sense and normativity in the more\nspecified ought of moral standards.\n\nAgainst a Kantian or neo-Kantian primacy or ultimacy of\n\u201cstructures of mind\u201d, Aquinas would say that just as the\npressure of reason articulated in the principle of non-contradiction\nhas its source in the structure of reality \u2013 in the real\nopposition between being and not being \u2013 so\nthe source of the equivalently first practical principle is the real\ndesirability of intelligible goods, and the true\nundesirability of what is not good.\n",
