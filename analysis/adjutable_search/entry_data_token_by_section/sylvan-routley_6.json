    "main_text": "Ontology and Metaphysics\n3. Ontology and Metaphysics\n\n\nIn this section, we present Sylvan\u2019s work in ontology and\nmetaphysics. As discussed below, Sylvan was deeply inspired by Alexius\nMeinong but, as a matter of terminology, their understanding of\n\u2018ontology\u2019 and \u2018metaphysics\u2019 differ: while\nMeinong would situate metaphysics and ontology as small corners within\na more general object theory, Sylvan situated them the other way\naround. (See, for instance, Meinong 1904, \u00a72 and \u00a711; Sylvan\n1995a, 47). In what follows, we follow Sylvan and employ what we take\nto be contemporary standard usage of \u2018ontology\u2019 (roughly\nunderstood as the study of what exists and what does not) and\n\u2018metaphysics\u2019 (roughly understood as the study of the\nstructure of reality), while acknowledging that Meinong-scholars might\ndispute this use of terms. In Section 3.1, we sketch some of the\nessential features of noneism, that is, Sylvan\u2019s theory\nabout non-existent objects. In Section 3.2, we discuss Sylvan\u2019s\nattempt at expanding the horizons of traditional ontology by\ndeveloping a new theory called sistology. Finally, in Section\n3.3, we summarize Sylvan\u2019s heterodox account of pluralism,\nlabelled plurallism.\n",
