    "main_text": "\n\nIf philosophy is the attempt \u201cto understand how things in the\nbroadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest\npossible sense of the term\u201d, as Sellars (1962) put it,\nphilosophy should not ignore technology. It is largely by technology\nthat contemporary society hangs together. It is hugely important not\nonly as an economic force but also as a cultural force. Indeed during\nthe last two centuries, when it gradually emerged as a discipline,\nphilosophy of technology has mostly been concerned with the meaning of\ntechnology for, and its impact on, society and culture, rather than\nwith technology itself. Mitcham (1994) calls this type of philosophy\nof technology \u201chumanities philosophy of technology\u201d\nbecause it accepts \u201cthe primacy of the humanities over\ntechnologies\u201d and is continuous with the overall perspective of\nthe humanities (and some of the social sciences). Only recently a\nbranch of the philosophy of technology has developed that is concerned\nwith technology itself and that aims to understand both the practice\nof designing and creating artifacts (in a wide sense, including\nartificial processes and systems) and the nature of the things so\ncreated. This latter branch of the philosophy of technology seeks\ncontinuity with the philosophy of science and with several other\nfields in the analytic tradition in modern philosophy, such as the\nphilosophy of action and decision-making, rather than with the\nhumanities and social science.\n\nThe entry starts with a brief historical overview, then continues with\na presentation of the themes on which modern analytic philosophy of\ntechnology focuses. This is followed by a discussion of the societal\nand ethical aspects of technology, in which some of the concerns of\nhumanities philosophy of technology are addressed. This twofold\npresentation takes into consideration the development of technology as\nthe outcome of a process originating within and guided by the practice\nof engineering, by standards on which only limited societal control is\nexercised, as well as the consequences for society of the\nimplementation of the technology so created, which result from\nprocesses upon which only limited control can be exercised.\n",
