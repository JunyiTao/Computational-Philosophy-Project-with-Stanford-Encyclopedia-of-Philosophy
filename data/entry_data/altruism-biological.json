    "preamble": "\n\n\nIn evolutionary biology, an organism is said to behave\naltruistically when its behaviour benefits other organisms, at a cost\nto itself. The costs and benefits are measured in terms of\nreproductive fitness, or expected number of offspring. So by\nbehaving altruistically, an organism reduces the number of offspring it\nis likely to produce itself, but boosts the number that other organisms\nare likely to produce. This biological notion of altruism is not\nidentical to the everyday concept. In everyday parlance, an action\nwould only be called \u2018altruistic\u2019 if it was done with the\nconscious intention of helping another. But in the biological sense\nthere is no such requirement. Indeed, some of the most interesting\nexamples of biological altruism are found among creatures that are\n(presumably) not capable of conscious thought at all, e.g. insects. For\nthe biologist, it is the consequences of an action for reproductive\nfitness that determine whether the action counts as altruistic, not the\nintentions, if any, with which the action is performed.\n\n\nAltruistic behaviour is common throughout the animal kingdom,\nparticularly in species with complex social structures. For example,\nvampire bats regularly regurgitate blood and donate it to other members\nof their group who have failed to feed that night, ensuring they do not\nstarve. In numerous bird species, a breeding pair receives help in\nraising its young from other \u2018helper\u2019 birds, who protect\nthe nest from predators and help to feed the fledglings. Vervet monkeys\ngive alarm calls to warn fellow monkeys of the presence of predators,\neven though in doing so they attract attention to themselves,\nincreasing their personal chance of being attacked. In social insect\ncolonies (ants, wasps, bees and termites), sterile workers devote their\nwhole lives to caring for the queen, constructing and protecting the\nnest, foraging for food, and tending the larvae. Such behaviour is\nmaximally altruistic: sterile workers obviously do not leave any\noffspring of their own\u2014so have personal fitness of zero\u2014but their\nactions greatly assist the reproductive efforts of the queen.\n\n\nFrom a Darwinian viewpoint, the existence of altruism in nature is\nat first sight puzzling, as Darwin himself realized. Natural selection\nleads us to expect animals to behave in ways that increase their\nown chances of survival and reproduction, not those of others.\nBut by behaving altruistically an animal reduces its own fitness, so\nshould be at a selective disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis one which\nbehaves selfishly. To see this, imagine that some members of a group of\nVervet monkeys give alarm calls when they see predators, but others do\nnot. Other things being equal, the latter will have an advantage. By\nselfishly refusing to give an alarm call, a monkey can reduce the\nchance that it will itself be attacked, while at the same time\nbenefiting from the alarm calls of others. So we should expect natural\nselection to favour those monkeys that do not give alarm calls over\nthose that do. But this raises an immediate puzzle. How did the\nalarm-calling behaviour evolve in the first place, and why has it not\nbeen eliminated by natural selection? How can the existence of altruism\nbe reconciled with basic Darwinian principles?\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Altruism and the Levels of Selection\n\n\nThe problem of altruism is intimately connected with questions about\nthe level at which natural selection acts. If selection acts\nexclusively at the individual level, favouring some individual\norganisms over others, then it seems that altruism cannot evolve, for\nbehaving altruistically is disadvantageous for the individual organism\nitself, by definition. However, it is possible that altruism may be\nadvantageous at the group level. A group containing lots of\naltruists, each ready to subordinate their own selfish interests for\nthe greater good of the group, may well have a survival advantage over\na group composed mainly or exclusively of selfish organisms. A process\nof between-group selection may thus allow the altruistic behaviour to\nevolve. Within each group, altruists will be at a selective\ndisadvantage relative to their selfish colleagues, but the fitness of\nthe group as a whole will be enhanced by the presence of altruists.\nGroups composed only or mainly of selfish organisms go extinct,\nleaving behind groups containing altruists. In the example of the\nVervet monkeys, a group containing a high proportion of alarm-calling\nmonkeys will have a survival advantage over a group containing a lower\nproportion. So conceivably, the alarm-calling behaviour may evolve by\nbetween-group selection, even though within each group, selection\nfavours monkeys that do not give alarm calls.\n\n\nThe idea that group selection might explain the evolution of\naltruism was first broached by Darwin himself. In The Descent of\nMan (1871), Darwin discussed the origin of altruistic and\nself-sacrificial behaviour among humans. Such behaviour is obviously\ndisadvantageous at the individual level, as Darwin realized: \u201che\nwho was ready to sacrifice his life, as many a savage has been, rather\nthan betray his comrades, would often leave no offspring to inherit his\nnoble nature\u201d (p.163). Darwin then argued that self-sacrificial\nbehaviour, though disadvantageous for the individual\n\u2018savage\u2019, might be beneficial at the group level: \u201ca\ntribe including many members who...were always ready to give aid to\neach other and sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be\nvictorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural\nselection\u201d (p.166). Darwin's suggestion is that the altruistic\nbehaviour in question may have evolved by a process of between-group\nselection.\n\n\nThe concept of group selection has a chequered and controversial\nhistory in evolutionary biology. The founders of modern \nneo-Darwinism\u2014R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. \nHaldane and S. Wright\u2014were all aware that\ngroup selection could in principle permit altruistic behaviours to\nevolve, but they doubted the importance of this evolutionary\nmechanism.  Nonetheless, many mid-twentieth century ecologists and\nsome ethologists, notably Konrad Lorenz, routinely assumed that\nnatural selection would produce outcomes beneficial for the whole\ngroup or species, often without even realizing that individual-level\nselection guarantees no such thing. This uncritical \u2018good of the\nspecies\u2019 tradition came to an abrupt halt in the 1960s, due\nlargely to the work of G.C. Williams (1966) and J. Maynard Smith\n(1964). These authors argued that group selection was an inherently\nweak evolutionary force, hence unlikely to promote interesting\naltruistic behaviours. This conclusion was supported by a number of\nmathematical models, which apparently showed that group selection\nwould only have significant effects for a limited range of parameter\nvalues.  As a result, the notion of group selection fell into\nwidespread disrepute in orthodox evolutionary circles; see Sober and\nWilson 1998, Segestrale 2000, Okasha 2006, Leigh 2010 and Sober 2011 for details of the\nhistory of this debate.\n\n\nThe major weakness of group selection as an explanation of altruism,\naccording to the consensus that emerged in the 1960s, was a problem\nthat Dawkins (1976) called \u2018subversion from within\u2019; see\nalso Maynard Smith 1964. Even if altruism is advantageous at the\ngroup level, within any group altruists are liable to be exploited by\nselfish \u2018free-riders\u2019 who refrain from behaving\naltruistically. These free-riders will have an obvious fitness\nadvantage: they benefit from the altruism of others, but do not incur\nany of the costs. So even if a group is composed exclusively of\naltruists, all behaving nicely towards each other, it only takes a\nsingle selfish mutant to bring an end to this happy idyll. By virtue of\nits relative fitness advantage within the group, the selfish mutant\nwill out-reproduce the altruists, hence selfishness will eventually\nswamp altruism. Since the generation time of individual organisms is\nlikely to be much shorter than that of groups, the probability that a\nselfish mutant will arise and spread is very high, according to this\nline of argument. \u2018Subversion from within\u2019 is generally\nregarded as a major stumbling block for group-selectionist theories\nof the evolution of altruism.\n\n\nIf group selection is not the correct explanation for how the\naltruistic behaviours found in nature evolved, then what is? In the\n1960s and 1970s a rival theory emerged: kin selection or\n\u2018inclusive fitness\u2019 theory, due originally to Hamilton\n(1964). This theory, discussed in detail below, apparently showed how\naltruistic behaviour could evolve\nwithout the need for group-level selection, and quickly\ngained prominence among biologists interested in the evolution of\nsocial behaviour; the empirical success of kin selection theory\ncontributed to the demise of the group selection concept. However, the\nprecise relation between kin and group selection is a source of\nongoing controversy (see for example the recent exchange\nin Nature between Nowak, Tarnita and Wilson 2010 and Abbot\net. al. 2011). Since the 1990s, proponents of \u2018multi-level\nselection theory\u2019 have resuscitated a form of group-level\nselection\u2014sometimes called \u2018new\u2019 group selection\u2014and\nshown that it can permit altruism to evolve (cf. Sober and Wilson\n1998). But \u2018new\u2019 group selection turns out to be\nmathematically equivalent to kin selection in most if not all cases,\nas a number of authors have emphasized (Grafen 1984, Frank 1998, West\net al. 2007, Lehmann et al. 2007, Marshall 2011); this point was\nalready appreciated by Hamilton (1975). Since the relation between\n\u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 group selection is itself a\npoint of controversy, this explains why disagreement about the\nrelation between kin and group selection should persist.\n2. Kin Selection and Inclusive Fitness\n\n\nThe basic idea of kin selection is simple. Imagine a gene which\ncauses its bearer to behave altruistically towards other organisms,\ne.g. by sharing food with them. Organisms without the gene are \nselfish\u2014they keep all their food for themselves, and sometimes get handouts\nfrom the altruists. Clearly the altruists will be at a fitness\ndisadvantage, so we should expect the altruistic gene to be eliminated\nfrom the population. However, suppose that altruists are discriminating\nin who they share food with. They do not share with just anybody, but\nonly with their relatives. This immediately changes things. For\nrelatives are genetically similar\u2014they share genes with one another.\nSo when an organism carrying the altruistic gene shares his food, there\nis a certain probability that the recipients of the food will also\ncarry copies of that gene. (How probable depends on how closely related\nthey are.) This means that the altruistic gene can in principle spread\nby natural selection. The gene causes an organism to behave in a way\nwhich reduces its own fitness but boosts the fitness of its \nrelatives\u2014who have a greater than average chance of carrying the gene\nthemselves. So the overall effect of the behaviour may be to increase\nthe number of copies of the altruistic gene found in the next\ngeneration, and thus the incidence of the altruistic behaviour\nitself.\n\n\nThough this argument was hinted at by Haldane in the 1930s, and to a\nlesser extent by Darwin in his discussion of sterile insect castes\nin  The Origin of Species, it was first made explicit by\nWilliam Hamilton (1964) in a pair of seminal papers. Hamilton\ndemonstrated rigorously that an altruistic gene will be favoured by\nnatural selection when a certain condition, known as\nHamilton's rule, is satisfied. In its simplest version, the\nrule states that b > c/r, where c is\nthe cost incurred by the altruist (the donor), b is the benefit\nreceived by the recipients of the altruism, and r is\nthe co-efficient of relationship between donor and\nrecipient. The costs and benefits are measured in terms of\nreproductive fitness. The co-efficient of relationship depends on the\ngenealogical relation between donor and recipient\u2014it is\ndefined as the probability that donor and recipient share genes at a\ngiven locus that are \u2018identical by descent\u2019. (Two genes\nare identical by descent if they are copies of a single gene in a\nshared ancestor.) In a sexually reproducing diploid species, the value\nof r for full siblings is \u00bd, for parents and offspring\n\u00bd, for grandparents and grandoffspring \u00bc, for full\ncousins 1/8,\u00a0 and so-on. The higher the value of r, the greater\nthe probability that the recipient of the altruistic behaviour will\nalso possess the gene for altruism. So what Hamilton's rule tells us\nis that a gene for altruism can spread by natural selection, so long\nas the cost incurred by the altruist is offset by a sufficient amount\nof benefit to sufficiently closed related relatives. The proof of\nHamilton's rule relies on certain non-trivial assumptions; see Frank\n1998, Grafen 1985, 2006, Queller 1992a, 1992b, Boyd and McIlreath 2006\nand Birch forthcoming for details.\n\n\nThough Hamilton himself did not use the term, his idea quickly\nbecame known as \u2018kin selection\u2019, for obvious reasons. Kin\nselection theory predicts that animals are more likely to behave\naltruistically towards their relatives than towards unrelated members\nof their species. Moreover, it predicts that the degree of\naltruism will be greater, the closer the relationship. In the years\nsince Hamilton's theory was devised, these predictions have been amply\nconfirmed by empirical work. For example, in various bird species, it\nhas been found that \u2018helper\u2019 birds are much more likely to\nhelp relatives raise their young, than they are to help unrelated\nbreeding pairs. Similarly, studies of Japanese macaques have shown that\naltruistic actions, such as defending others from attack, tend to be\npreferentially directed towards close kin. In most social insect\nspecies, a peculiarity of the genetic system known as\n\u2018haplodiploidy\u2019 means that females on average share more\ngenes with their sisters than with their own offspring. So a female may\nwell be able to get more genes into the next generation by helping the\nqueen reproduce, hence increasing the number of sisters she will have,\nrather than by having offspring of her own. Kin selection theory\ntherefore provides a neat explanation of how sterility in the social\ninsects may have evolved by Darwinian means. (Note, however, that the\nprecise significance of haplodiploidy for the evolution of worker\nsterility is a controversial question; see Maynard Smith and Szathmary\n1995 ch.16, Gardner, Alpedrinha and West 2012.)\n\n\nKin selection theory is often presented as a triumph of the\n\u2018gene's-eye view of evolution\u2019, which sees organic\nevolution as the result of competition among genes for increased\nrepresentation in the gene-pool, and individual organisms as mere\n\u2018vehicles\u2019 that genes have constructed to aid their\npropagation (Dawkins 1976, 1982). The gene's eye-view is certainly\nthe easiest way of understanding kin selection, and was employed by\nHamilton himself in his 1964 papers. Altruism seems anomalous from the\nindividual organism's point of view, but from the gene's point of view\nit makes good sense. A gene wants to maximize the number of copies of\nitself that are found in the next generation; one way of doing that is\nto cause its host organism to behave altruistically towards other\nbearers of the gene, so long as the costs and benefits satisfy the\nHamilton inequality. But interestingly, Hamilton showed that kin\nselection can also be understood from the organism's point of view.\nThough an altruistic behaviour which spreads by kin selection reduces\nthe organism's personal fitness (by definition), it increases what\nHamilton called the organism's inclusive fitness. An\norganism's inclusive fitness is defined as its personal fitness, plus\nthe sum of its weighted effects on the fitness of every other organism\nin the population, the weights determined by the coefficient of\nrelationship r. Given this definition, natural selection will act to\nmaximise the inclusive fitness of individuals in the population (Grafen 2006).\nInstead of thinking in terms of selfish genes trying to maximize their\nfuture representation in the gene-pool, we can think in terms of\norganisms trying to maximize their inclusive fitness. Most people find\nthe \u2018gene's eye\u2019 approach to kin selection heuristically\nsimpler than the inclusive fitness approach, but mathematically they\nare in fact equivalent (Michod 1982, Frank 1998, Boyd and\nMcIlreath 2006, Grafen 2006).\n\n\nContrary to what is sometimes thought, kin selection does not\nrequire that animals must have the ability to discriminate relatives\nfrom non-relatives, less still to calculate coefficients of\nrelationship. Many animals can in fact recognize their kin, often by\nsmell, but kin selection can operate in the absence of such an ability.\nHamilton's inequality can be satisfied so long as an animal behaves\naltruistically towards other animals that are in fact its\nrelatives. The animal might achieve this by having the ability\nto tell relatives from non-relatives, but this is not the only\npossibility. An alternative is to use some proximal indicator of\nkinship. For example, if an animal behaves altruistically towards those\nin its immediate vicinity, then the recipients of the altruism are\nlikely to be relatives, given that relatives tend to live near each\nother. No ability to recognize kin is presupposed. Cuckoos exploit\nprecisely this fact, free-riding on the innate tendency of birds to\ncare for the young in their nests.\n\n\nAnother popular misconception is that kin selection theory is\ncommitted to \u2018genetic determinism\u2019, the idea that genes\nrigidly determine or control behaviour. Though some sociobiologists\nhave made incautious remarks to this effect, evolutionary theories of\nbehaviour, including kin selection, are not committed to it. So long as\nthe behaviours in question have a genetical component, i.e.\nare influenced to some extent by one or more genetic factor, then the\ntheories can apply. When Hamilton (1964) talks about a gene which\n\u2018causes\u2019 altruism, this is really shorthand for a gene\nwhich increases the probability that its bearer will behave\naltruistically, to some degree. This is much weaker than saying that\nthe behaviour is genetically \u2018determined\u2019, and is quite\ncompatible with the existence of strong environmental influences on the\nbehaviour's expression. Kin selection theory does not deny the truism\nthat all traits are affected by both genes and environment. Nor does it\ndeny that many interesting animal behaviours are transmitted through\nnon-genetical means, such as imitation and social learning (Avital and\nJablonka 2000).\n\n\nThe importance of kinship for the evolution of altruism is very widely\naccepted today, on both theoretical and empirical grounds.  However,\nkinship is really only a way of ensuring that altruists and recipients\nboth carry copies of the altruistic gene, which is the fundamental\nrequirement. If altruism is to evolve, it must be the case that the\nrecipients of altruistic actions have a greater than average\nprobability of being altruists themselves. Kin-directed altruism is\nthe most obvious way of satisfying this condition, but there are other\npossibilities too (Hamilton 1975, Sober and Wilson 1998, Bowles and\nGintis 2011, Gardner and West 2011). For example, if the gene that\ncauses altruism also causes animals to favour a particular feeding\nground (for whatever reason), then the required correlation between\ndonor and recipient may be generated. It is this correlation, however\nbrought about, that is necessary for altruism to evolve. This point\nwas noted by Hamilton himself in the 1970s: he stressed that the\ncoefficient of relationship of his 1964 papers should really be\nreplaced with a more general correlation coefficient, which reflects\nthe probability that altruist and recipient share genes, whether\nbecause of kinship or not (Hamilton 1970, 1972, 1975).  This point is\ntheoretically important, and has not always been recognized; but in\npractice, kinship remains the most important source of statistical\nassociations between altruists and recipients (Maynard Smith 1998,\nOkasha 2002, West\net al. 2007).\n2.1 A Simple Illustration: the Prisoner's dilemma\n\n\nThe fact that correlation between donor and recipient is the key to\nthe evolution of altruism can be illustrated via a simple \u2018one shot\u2019\nPrisoner's dilemma game. Consider a large population of organisms who\nengage in a social interaction in pairs; the interaction affects their\nbiological fitness. Organisms are of two types: selfish (S) and\naltruistic (A). The latter engage in pro-social behaviour, thus\nbenefiting their partner but at a cost to themselves; the former do\nnot. So in a mixed (S,A) pair, the selfish organism does better\u2014he\nbenefits from his partner's altruism without incurring any\ncost. However, (A,A) pairs do better than (S,S) pairs\u2014for the former\nwork as a co-operative unit, while the latter do not. The interaction\nthus has the form of a one-shot Prisoner's dilemma, familiar from game\ntheory. Illustrative payoff values to each \u2018player\u2019, i.e., each partner\nin the interaction, measured in units of biological fitness, are shown\nin the matrix below.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer 2\n\n\n\n\nAltruist\nSelfish\n\n\nPlayer 1\nAltruist\n11,11\n0,20\n\n\nSelfish\n20,0\n5,5\n\n\nPayoffs for (Player 1, Player 2) in units of reproductive\nfitness\n\n\nThe question we are interested in is: which type will be favoured by\nselection? To make the analysis tractable, we make two simplifying\nassumptions: that reproduction is asexual, and that type is perfectly\ninherited, i.e., selfish (altruistic) organisms give rise to selfish\n(altruistic) offspring. Modulo these assumptions, the evolutionary\ndynamics can be determined very easily, simply by seeing whether\nthe S or the A type has higher fitness, in the\noverall population. The fitness of the S\ntype, W(S), is the weighted average of the payoff to\nan S when partnered with an S and the payoff to\nan S when partnered with an A, where the weights are\ndetermined by the probability of having the partner in\nquestion. Therefore,\n\nW(S) = 5 * Prob(S partner/S) + \n 20 * Prob(A partner/S)\n\n\n\n\n(The conditional probabilities in the above expression should be read\nas the probability of having a selfish (altruistic) partner, given\nthat one is selfish oneself.)\n\n\nSimilarly, the fitness of the A type is:\n\nW(A) = 0 * Prob(S partner/A) +\n 11 * Prob(A partner/A)\n\n\n\n\nFrom these expressions for the fitnesses of the two types of organism,\nwe can immediately deduce that the altruistic type will only be\nfavoured by selection if there is a statistical correlation between\npartners, i.e., if altruists have greater than random chance of being\npaired with other altruists, and similarly for selfish types. For\nsuppose there is no such correlation\u2014as would be the case if the\npairs were formed by random sampling from the population. Then, the\nprobability of having a selfish partner would be the same for\nboth S and A types, i.e., P(S\npartner/S) = P(S partner/A). Similarly,\nP(A partner/S) = P(A\npartner/A). From these probabilistic equalities, it follows\nimmediately that W(S) is greater\nthan W(A), as can be seen from the expressions for\nW(S) and W(A) above; so the\nselfish type will be favoured by natural selection, and will increase\nin frequency every generation until all the altruists are eliminated\nfrom the population. Therefore, in the absence of correlation between\npartners, selfishness must win out (cf. Skyrms 1996). This confirms the point noted in\nsection 2\u2014that altruism can only evolve if there is a statistical\ntendency for the beneficiaries of altruistic actions to be altruists\nthemselves.\n\nIf the correlation between partners is sufficiently strong, in this\nsimple model, then it is possible for the\ncondition W(A) > W(S) to be\nsatisfied, and thus for altruism to evolve. The easiest way to see\nthis is to suppose that the correlation is perfect, i.e., selfish\ntypes are always paired with other selfish types, and ditto for\naltruists, so P(S partner/S) = P(A\npartner/A) = 1. This assumption implies\nthat W(A)=11 and W(S)=5, so\naltruism evolves. With intermediate degrees of correlation, it is also\npossible for the condition W(S)\n> W(A) to be satisfied, given the particular\nchoice of payoff values in the model above.\n\nThis simple model also highlights the point made previously, that\ndonor-recipient correlation, rather than genetic relatedness, is the\nkey to the evolution of altruism. What is needed for altruism to\nevolve, in the model above, is for the probability of having a partner\nof the same type as oneself to be sufficiently larger than the\nprobability of having a partner of opposite type; this ensures that\nthe recipients of altruism have a greater than random chance of being\nfellow altruists, i.e., donor-recipient correlation. Whether this\ncorrelation arises because partners tend to be relatives, or because\naltruists are able to seek out other altruists and choose them as\npartners, or for some other reason, makes no difference to the\nevolutionary dynamics, at least in this simple example. \n3. Conceptual Issues\n\nAltruism is a well understood topic in evolutionary biology; the\ntheoretical ideas explained above have been extensively analysed,\nempirically confirmed, and are widely accepted. Nonetheless, there are\na number of conceptual ambiguities surrounding altruism and related\nconcepts in the literature; some of these are purely semantic, others\nare more substantive. Three such ambiguities are briefly discussed\nbelow; for further discussion, see West et al. 2007, Sachs\net al. 2004 or Lehmann and Keller 2006.\n3.1 Altruism, Co-operation, Mutualism\n\nAccording to the standard definition, a social behaviour counts as\naltruistic if it reduces the fitness of the organism performing the\nbehaviour, but boosts the fitness of others. This was the definition\nused by Hamilton (1964), and by many subsequent authors. However,\nthere is less consensus on how to describe behaviours that boost the\nfitness of others but also boost the fitness of the organism\nperforming the behaviour. As West et al. (2007) note, such\nbehaviours are sometimes termed \u2018co-operative\u2019, but this\nusage is not universal; others use \u2018co-operation\u2019 to refer\nto behaviour that boosts the fitness of others irrespective of its\neffect on self; while still others use \u2018cooperation\u2019 as a\nsynonym for altruism. (Indeed, in the simple Prisoner's dilemma game\nabove, the two strategies are usually called \u2018co-operate\u2019\nand \u2018defect\u2019.) To avoid this confusion, West et\nal. (2007) suggest the term \u2018mutual benefit\u2019 for\nbehaviours that benefit both self and other, while Sachs et\nal. (2004) suggest \u2018byproduct benefit\u2019.\n\n\nWhatever term is used, the important point is that behaviours that\nbenefit both self and others can evolve much more easily than\naltruistic behaviours, and thus require no special mechanisms such as\nkinship. The reason is clear: organisms performing such behaviours\nthereby increase their personal fitness, so are at a selective\nadvantage vis-a-vis those not performing the behaviour. The fact that\nthe behaviour has a beneficial effect on the fitness of others is a\nmere side-effect, or byproduct, and is not part of the explanation for\nwhy the behaviour evolves. For example, Sachs et al. (2004)\nnote that an action such as joining a herd or a flock may be of this\nsort; the individual gains directly, via his reduced risk of\npredation, while simultaneously reducing the predation risk of other\nindividuals. By contrast with an altruistic action, there is no\npersonal incentive to \u2018cheat\u2019, i.e., to refrain from\nperforming the action, for doing so would directly reduce personal\nfitness.\n\nAlso indicative of the difference between altruistic behaviour and\nbehaviour that benefit both self and others is the fact that in the\nlatter case, though not the former, the beneficiary may be a member of\na different species, without altering the evolutionary dynamics of the\nbehaviour. Indeed, there are numerous examples where the\nself-interested activities of one organism produce an incidental\nbenefit for a non-conspecific; such behaviours are sometimes called\n\u2018mutualistic\u2019, though again, this is not the only way that\nthe latter term has been used (West et al. 2007). By\ncontrast, in the case of altruism, it makes an enormous difference\nwhether the beneficiary and the donor are con-specifics or not; for\nif not, then kin selection can play no role, and it is quite unclear how\nthe altruistic behaviour can evolve. Unsurprisingly, virtually all the\nbona fide examples of biological altruism in the living world involve\ndonors and recipients that are con-specifics. (Cases of so-called\n\u2018reciprocal altruism\u2019 are sometimes thought to be\nexceptions to this generalization; but see section 4 below.)\n3.2 Weak and Strong Altruism\n\nA quite different ambiguity concerns the distinction between weak and\nstrong altruism, in the terminology of D.S. Wilson (1977, 1980,\n1990). This distinction is about whether the altruistic action entails\nan absolute or relative fitness reduction for the donor. To count as\nstrongly altruistic, a behaviour must reduce the absolute\nfitness (i.e., number of offspring) of the donor. Strong altruism is\nthe standard notion of altruism in the literature, and was assumed\nabove. To count as weakly altruistic, an action need only reduce\nthe relative fitness of the donor, i.e., its fitness relative\nto that of the recipient. Thus for example, an action which causes an\norganism to leave an additional 10 offspring, but causes each\norganism(s) with which it interacts to leave an additional 20\noffspring, is weakly but not strongly altruistic. The action boosts\nthe absolute fitness of the \u2018donor\u2019, but boosts the\nabsolute fitness of other organisms by even more, thus reducing the\ndonor's relative fitness.\n\n\nShould weakly altruistic behaviours be classified as altruistic or\nselfish? This question is not merely semantic; for the real issue is\nwhether the conditions under which weak altruism can evolve are\nrelevantly similar to the conditions under which strong altruism can\nevolve, or not. Many authors argue that the answer is\n\u2018no\u2019, on the grounds that weakly altruistic behaviours are\nindividually advantageous, so can evolve with no component of kin\nselection or donor-recipient correlation, unlike strongly altruistic\nbehaviours (Grafen 1984, Nunney 1985, West et\nal. 2007). To appreciate this argument, consider a\ngame-theoretic scenario similar to the one-shot Prisoner's dilemma of\nsection 4, in which organisms engage in a pair-wise interaction that\naffects their fitness. Organisms are of two types, weakly altruistic\n(W) and non-altruistic (N). W-types perform\nan action that boosts their own fitness by 10 units and the fitness of\ntheir partner by 20 units; N-types do not perform the action. The\npayoff matrix is thus:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer 2\n\n\n\n\nWeak Altruist\nNon\n\n\nPlayer 1\nWeak Altruist\n30,30\n10,20\n\n\nNon\n20,10\n0,0\n\n\nPayoffs for (Player 1, Player 2) in units of reproductive\nfitness\n\n\nThe payoff matrix highlights the fact that weak altruism is\nindividually advantageous, and thus the oddity of thinking of it it as\naltruistic rather than selfish. To see this, assume for a moment that\nthe game is being played by two rational agents, as in classical game\ntheory. Clearly, the rational strategy for each individual\nis W, for W dominates N. Each individual\ngets a higher payoff from playing W\nthan N, irrespective of what its opponent \ndoes\u201430 rather than 20 if the opponent plays W, 10 rather\nthan 0 if the opponent plays N. This captures a clear sense\nin which weak altruism is individually advantageous.\n\nIn the context of evolutionary game theory, where the game is being\nplayed by pairs of organisms with hard-wired strategies, the\ncounterpart of the fact that W dominates N is the\nfact that W can spread in the population even if pairs are\nformed at random (cf. Wilson 1980). To see this, consider the\nexpressions for the overall population-wide fitnesses of W\nand N:\n\nW(W) = 30 * Prob(W partner/W) + 10\n* Prob(N partner/W)\n\n\nW(N) = 20 * Prob(W partner/N) + 0\n* Prob(N partner/N)\n\n\n(As before, Prob(W partner/W) denotes the\nconditional probability of having a weakly altruistic partner given\nthat one is weakly altruistic oneself, and so-on.)  From these\nexpressions, it is easy to see that W(W)\n> W(N) even if the there is no correlation among\npartners, i.e., even if Prob(W partner/W) =\nP(W partner/N) and P(N partner/W)\n= P(N partner/N). Therefore, weak altruism can evolve in the\nabsence of donor-recipient correlation; as we saw, this is not true of\nstrong altruism. So weak and strong altruism evolve by different\nevolutionary mechanisms, hence should not be co-classified, according\nto this argument.\n\n\nHowever, there is a counter argument due to D.S. Wilson (1977, 1980),\nwho maintains that weak altruism cannot evolve by individual selection\nalone; a component of group selection is needed. Wilson's argument\nstems from the fact that in a mixed (W,N) pair, the\nnon-altruist is fitter than the weak altruist. More generally, within\na single group of any size containing weak altruists and\nnon-altruists, the latter will be fitter. So weak altruism can only\nevolve, Wilson argues, in a multi-group setting\u2014in which the\nwithin-group selection in favour of N, is counteracted by\nbetween-group selection in favour of W. (On Wilson's view, the\nevolutionary game described above is a multi-group setting, involving\na large number of groups of size two.) Thus weak altruism, like strong\naltruism, in fact evolves because it is group-advantageous, Wilson\nargues.\n\n\nThe dispute between those who regard weak altruism as individually\nadvantageous, and those like Wilson who regard it as group\nadvantageous, stems ultimately from differing conceptions of\nindividual and group selection. For Wilson, individual selection means\nwithin-group selection, so to determine which strategy is favoured by\nindividual selection, one must compare the fitnesses of W\nand N types within a group, or pair. For other theorists,\nindividual selection means selection based on differences in\nindividual phenotype, rather than social context; so to determine\nwhich strategy is favoured by individual selection, one must compare\nthe fitnesses of W and N types in the same social\ncontext, i.e., with the same partner. These two comparisons yield\ndifferent answers to the question of whether weak altruism is\nindividually advantageous. Thus the debate over how to classify weak\naltruism is intimately connected to the broader levels of selection\nquestion; see Nunney 1985, Okasha 2005, 2006, Fletcher and Doebeli\n2006, West et al. 2007, for further discussion.\n3.3 Short-term versus Long-term Fitness Consequences\n\n\nA further source of ambiguity in the definition of biological altruism\nconcerns the time-scale over which fitness is measured. Conceivably,\nan animal might engage in a social behaviour which benefits another\nand reduces its own (absolute) fitness in the short-term; however, in\nthe long-term, the behaviour might be to the animal's advantage. So if\nwe focus on short-term fitness effects, the behaviour will seem\naltruistic; but if we focus on lifetime fitness, the behaviour will\nseem selfish\u2014the animal's lifetime fitness would be reduced if it\ndid not perform the behaviour.\n\n\nWhy might a social behaviour reduce an animal's short-term fitness but\nboost its lifetime fitness? This could arise in cases of \u2018directed\nreciprocation\u2019, where the beneficiary of the behaviour returns the\nfavour at some point in the future (cf. Sachs et al. 2004). By\nperforming the behaviour, and suffering the short-term cost, the\nanimal thus ensures (or raises the chance) that it will receive return\nbenefits in the future. Similarly, in symbioses between members of\ndifferent species, it may pay an organism to sacrifice resources for\nthe benefit of a symbiont with which it has a long-term relationship,\nas its long-term welfare may be heavily dependent on the symbiont's\nwelfare.  \n\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the most satisfactory resolution of\nthis ambiguity is to use lifetime fitness as the relevant parameter\n(cf. West et al. 2007) Thus an action only counts as\naltruistic if it reduces an organism's lifetime fitness. This\nstipulation makes sense, since it preserves the key idea that the\nevolution of altruism requires statistical association between donor\nand recipient; this would not be true if short-term fitness were used\nto define altruism, for behaviours which reduce short-term fitness but\nboost lifetime fitness can evolve with no component of kin selection,\nor donor-recipient correlation. However, the stipulation has two\ndisadvantages: (i) it makes it harder to tell whether a given\nbehaviour is altruistic, since lifetime fitness is notoriously\ndifficult to estimate; (ii) it has the consequence that most models of\n\u2018reciprocal altruism\u2019 are mis-named.\n4. Reciprocal Altruism\n\n\nThe theory of reciprocal altruism was originally developed by Trivers\n(1971), as an attempt to explain cases of (apparent) altruism among\nunrelated organisms, including members of different species. (Clearly,\nkin selection cannot help explain altruism among non-relatives.)\nTrivers' basic idea was straightforward: it may pay an organism to\nhelp another, if there is an expectation of the favour being returned\nin the future. (\u2018If you scratch my back, I'll scratch\nyours\u2019.) The cost of helping is offset by the likelihood of the\nreturn benefit, permitting the behaviour to evolve by natural\nselection. Trivers termed with evolutionary mechanism\n\u2018reciprocal altruism\u2019.\n\n\nFor reciprocal altruism to work, there is no need for the two\nindividuals to be relatives, nor even to be members of the same\nspecies. However, it is necessary that individuals should interact\nwith each more than once, and have the ability to recognize other\nindividuals with whom they have interacted in the\n past.[1] \n If individuals interact only once in their lifetimes and never meet\nagain, there is obviously no possibility of return benefit, so there\nis nothing to be gained by helping another. However, if individuals\nencounter each other frequently, and are capable of identifying and\npunishing \u2018cheaters\u2019 who have refused to help in the past,\nthen the helping behaviour can evolve.  A \u2018cheat\u2019 who\nrefuses to help will ultimately sabotage his own interests, for\nalthough he does not incur the cost of helping others, he forfeits the\nreturn benefits too\u2014others will not help him in the\nfuture. This evolutionary mechanism is most likely to work where\nanimals live in relatively small groups, increasing the likelihood of\nmultiple encounters.\n\nAs West et al. (2007) and Bowles and Gintis (2011) note, if altruism is defined by reference to\nlifetime fitness, then Trivers' theory is not really about the\nevolution of altruism at all; for behaviours that evolve via\nreciprocation of benefits, as described by Trivers, are ultimately of\ndirect benefit to the individuals performing them, so do not reduce\nlifetime fitness. Despite this consideration, the label \u2018reciprocal\naltruism\u2019 is well-entrenched in the literature, and the evolutionary\nmechanism that it describes is of some importance, whatever it is\ncalled. Where reciprocal altruism is referred to below, it should be\nremembered that the behaviours in question are only altruistic in the\nshort-term. \n\n\nThe concept of reciprocal altruism is closely related to the\nTit-for-Tat strategy in the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) from\ngame theory. In the IPD, players interact on multiple occasions, and\nare able to adjust their behaviour depending on what their opponent\nhas done in previous rounds. There are two possible strategies,\nco-operate and defect; the payoff matrix (per interaction) is as in\nsection 2.1 above. The fact that the game is iterated rather than\none-shot obviously changes the optimal course of action; defecting is\nno longer necessarily the best option, so long as the probability of\nsubsequent encounters is sufficiently high. In their famous computer\ntournament in which a large number of strategies were pitted against\neach other in the IPD, Axelrod and Hamilton (1981) found that the\nTit-for-Tat strategy yielded the highest payoff. In Tit-For-Tat, a\nplayer follows two basic rules: (i) on the first encounter, cooperate;\n(ii) on subsequent encounters, do what your opponent did on the\nprevious encounter. The success of Tit-for-Tat was widely taken to\nconfirm the idea that with multiple encounters, natural selection\ncould favour social behaviours that entail a short-term fitness\ncost. Subsequent work in evolutionary game theory, much of it inspired\nby Axelrod and Hamilton's ideas, has confirmed that repeated games\npermit the evolution of social behaviours that cannot evolve in\none-shot situations (cf. Nowak 2006); this is closely related to the\nso-called 'folk theorem' of repeated game theory in economics\n(cf. Bowles and Gintis 2011). For a useful discussion of social\nbehaviour that evolves via reciprocation of benefits, see Sachs\net al. 2004.\n\n\nDespite the attention paid to reciprocal altruism by theoreticians,\nclear-cut empirical examples in non-human animals are relatively few\n(Hammerstein 2003, Sachs et al. 2004, Taborsky 2013). This is\nprobably because the pre-conditions for reciprocal altruism to evolve-\nmultiple encounters and individual recognition\u2014are not especially\ncommon. However, one possible example is provided by blood-sharing in\nvampire bats (Wilkinson 1984, 1990, Carter & Wilkinson 2013). It\nis quite common for a vampire bat to fail to feed on a given\nnight. This is potentially fatal, for bats die if they go without food\nfor more than a couple of days. On any given night, bats donate blood\n(by regurgitation) to other members of their group who have failed to\nfeed, thus saving them from starvation. Since vampire bats live in\nsmall groups and associate with each other over long periods of time,\nthe preconditions for reciprocal altruism are likely to be met.\nWilkinson and his colleagues' studies showed that bats tended to share\nfood with their close associates, and were more likely to share with\nothers that had recently shared with them. These findings appear to\naccord with reciprocal altruism theory.\n\n\nTrivers (1985) describes an apparent case of reciprocal altruism\nbetween non con-specifics. On tropical coral reefs, various species of\nsmall fish act as \u2018cleaners\u2019 for large fish, removing\nparasites from their mouths and gills. The interaction is mutually\nbeneficial\u2014the large fish gets cleaned and the cleaner gets\nfed. However, Trivers notes that the large fish sometimes appear to\nbehave altruistically towards the cleaners. If a large fish is\nattacked by a predator while it has a cleaner in its mouth, then it\nwaits for the cleaner to leave before fleeing the predator, rather\nthan swallowing the cleaner and fleeing immediately. Trivers explains\nthe larger fish's behaviour in terms of reciprocal altruism. Since the\nlarge fish often returns to the same cleaner many times over, it pays\nto look after the cleaner's welfare, i.e., not to swallow it, even if\nthis increases the chance of being wounded by a predator. So the\nlarger fish allows the cleaner to escape, because there is an\nexpectation of return benefit\u2014getting cleaned again in the\nfuture. As in the case of the vampire bats, it is because the large\nfish and the cleaner interact more than once that the behaviour can\nevolve.\n5. But is it \u2018Real\u2019 Altruism?\n\n\nThe evolutionary theories described above, in particular kin\nselection, go a long way towards reconciling the existence of altruism\nin nature with Darwinian principles.  However, some people have felt\nthese theories in a way devalue altruism, and that the behaviours they\nexplain are not \u2018really\u2019 altruistic. The grounds for this\nview are easy to see. Ordinarily we think of altruistic actions as\ndisinterested, done with the interests of the recipient, rather than\nour own interests, in mind. But kin selection theory explains\naltruistic behaviour as a clever strategy devised by selfish genes as\na way of increasing their representation in the gene-pool, at the\nexpense of other genes. Surely this means that the behaviours in\nquestion are only \u2018apparently\u2019 altruistic, for they are\nultimately the result of genic self-interest? Reciprocal altruism\ntheory also seems to \u2018take the altruism out of\naltruism\u2019. Behaving nicely to someone in order to procure return\nbenefits from them in the future seems in a way the antithesis of\n\u2018real\u2019 altruism\u2014it is just delayed self-interest.\n\n\nThis is a tempting line of argument. Indeed Trivers (1971) and,\narguably, Dawkins (1976) were themselves tempted by it. But it should\nnot convince. The key point to remember is that biological altruism\ncannot be equated with altruism in the everyday vernacular sense.\nBiological altruism is defined in terms of fitness consequences, not\nmotivating intentions. If by \u2018real\u2019 altruism we mean\naltruism done with the conscious intention to help, then the vast\nmajority of living creatures are not capable of \u2018real\u2019\naltruism nor therefore of \u2018real\u2019 selfishness either. Ants\nand termites, for example, presumably do not have conscious intentions,\nhence their behaviour cannot be done with the intention of promoting\ntheir own self-interest, nor the interests of others. Thus the\nassertion that the evolutionary theories reviewed above show that the\naltruism in nature is only apparent makes little sense. The contrast\nbetween \u2018real\u2019 altruism and merely apparent altruism simply\ndoes not apply to most animal species.\n\n\nTo some extent, the idea that kin-directed altruism is not\n\u2018real\u2019 altruism has been fostered by the use of the\n\u2018selfish gene\u2019 terminology of Dawkins (1976). As we have\nseen, the gene's-eye perspective is heuristically useful for\nunderstanding the evolution of altruistic behaviours, especially those\nthat evolve by kin selection. But talking about \u2018selfish\u2019\ngenes trying to increase their representation in the gene-pool is of\ncourse just a metaphor (as Dawkins fully admits); there is no literal\nsense in which genes \u2018try\u2019 to do anything. Any\nevolutionary explanation of how a phenotypic trait evolves must\nultimately show that the trait leads to an increase in frequency of\nthe genes that code for it (presuming the trait is transmitted\ngenetically.) Therefore, a \u2018selfish gene\u2019 story can by\ndefinition be told about any trait, including a behavioural trait,\nthat evolves by Darwinian natural selection. To say that kin selection\ninterprets altruistic behaviour as a strategy designed by\n\u2018selfish\u2019 genes to aid their propagation is not wrong; but\nit is just another way of saying that a Darwinian explanation for the\nevolution of altruism has been found. As Sober and Wilson (1998) note,\nif one insists on saying that behaviours which evolve by kin selection\n/ donor-recipient correlation are \u2018really selfish\u2019, one\nends up reserving the word \u2018altruistic\u2019 for behaviours\nwhich cannot evolve by natural selection at all.\n\n\nDo theories of the evolution of biological altruism apply to humans?\nThis is part of the broader question of whether ideas about the\nevolution of animal behaviour can be extrapolated to humans, a\nquestion that fuelled the sociobiology controversy of the 1980s and is\nstill actively debated today (cf. Boyd and Richerson 2006, Bowles and\nGintis 2011, Sterelny 2012). All biologists accept that Homo sapiens is an\nevolved species, and thus that general evolutionary principles apply\nto it. However, human behaviour is obviously influenced by culture to\na far greater extent than that of other animals, and is often the\nproduct of conscious beliefs and desires (though this does not\nnecessarily mean that genetics has no influence.) Nonetheless, at\nleast some human behaviour does seem to fit the predictions of the\nevolutionary theories reviewed above. In general, humans behave more\naltruistically (in the biological sense) towards their close kin than\ntowards non-relatives, e.g. by helping relatives raise their children,\njust as kin selection theory would predict. It is also true that we\ntend to help those who have helped us out in the past, just as\nreciprocal altruism theory would predict. On the other hand, humans\nare unique in that we co-operate extensively with our non-kin; and\nmore generally, numerous human behaviours seem anomalous from the\npoint of view of biological fitness. Think for example of adoption.\nParents who adopt children instead of having their own reduce their\nbiological fitness, obviously, so adoption is an altruistic behaviour.\nBut it does not benefit kin\u2014for parents are generally\nunrelated to the infants they adopt\u2014and nor do the parents\nstand to gain much in the form of reciprocal benefits. So although\nevolutionary considerations can help us understand some human\nbehaviours, they must be applied judiciously.\n\n\nWhere human behaviour is concerned, the distinction between biological\naltruism, defined in terms of fitness consequences, and\n\u2018real\u2019 altruism, defined in terms of the agent's conscious\nintentions to help others, does make sense. (Sometimes the label\n\u2018psychological altruism\u2019 is used instead of\n\u2018real\u2019 altruism.) What is the relationship between these\ntwo concepts? They appear to be independent in both directions, as\nElliott Sober (1994) has argued; see also Vromen (2012) and Clavien and Chapuisat (2013).  An action\nperformed with the conscious intention of helping another human being\nmay not affect their biological fitness at all, so would not count as\naltruistic in the biological sense. Conversely, an action undertaken\nfor purely self-interested reasons, i.e., without the conscious\nintention of helping another, may boost their biological fitness\ntremendously.\n\n\nSober argues that, even if we accept an evolutionary approach to human\nbehaviour, there is no particular reason to think that evolution would\nhave made humans into egoists rather than psychological altruists (see\nalso Schulz 2011). On the contrary, it is quite possible that natural\nselection would have favoured humans who genuinely do care about\nhelping others, i.e., who are capable of \u2018real\u2019 or\npsychological altruism.  Suppose there is an evolutionary advantage\nassociated with taking good care of one's children\u2014a quite\nplausible idea. Then, parents who\nreally do care about their childrens' welfare, i.e., who are\n\u2018real\u2019 altruists, will have a higher inclusive fitness,\nhence spread more of their genes, than parents who only pretend to\ncare, or who do not care. Therefore, evolution may well lead\n\u2018real\u2019 or psychological altruism to evolve. Contrary to\nwhat is often thought, an evolutionary approach to human behaviour does\nnot imply that humans are likely to be motivated by\nself-interest alone. One strategy by which \u2018selfish genes\u2019\nmay increase their future representation is by causing humans to be\nnon-selfish, in the psychological sense.\n",
