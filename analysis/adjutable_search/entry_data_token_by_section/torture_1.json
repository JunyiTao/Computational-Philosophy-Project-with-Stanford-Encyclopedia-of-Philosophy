What is Inherently Wrong with Torture?\n\nIn terms of the above definition of torture there are at least two\nthings that are inherently morally wrong with torture. Firstly,\ntorture consists in part in the intentional infliction of severe\nphysical suffering \u2013 typically, severe pain; that is, torture\nhurts very badly. For this reason alone, torture is an evil thing.\n\nSecondly, torture of human beings consists in part in the intentional,\nsubstantial curtailment of individual autonomy. Given the moral\nimportance of autonomy, torture is an evil thing \u2013 even considered\nindependently of the physical suffering it involves. (And if torture\ninvolves the breaking of someone\u2019s will, especially in the\nmaximalist sense, then it is an even greater evil than otherwise would\nbe the case.)\n\nGiven that torture involves both the infliction of extreme physical\nsuffering and the substantial curtailment of the victim\u2019s\nautonomy, torture is a very great evil indeed. Nevertheless, there is\nsome dispute about how great an evil torture is relative to other\ngreat evils, specifically killing and murder.\n\nMany have suggested that torture is a greater evil than killing or\neven murder. For example, Michael Davis claims, \u201cBoth torture\nand (premature) death are very great evils but, if one is a greater\nevil than the other, it is certainly torture\u201d (2005: 165), and\nDavid Sussman says, \u201cYet while there is a very strong moral\npresumption against both killing and torturing a human being, it seems\nthat we take the presumption against torture to be even greater than\nthat against homicide\u201d (2005: 15).\n\nCertainly, torturing an innocent person to death is worse than murder,\nfor it involves torture in addition to murder. On the other hand,\ntorture does not necessarily involve killing, let alone murder, and\nindeed torturers do not necessarily have the power of life and death\nover their victims. Consider police officers whose superiors turn a\nblind eye to their illegal use of torture, but who do not, and could\nnot, cover-up the murder of those tortured; the infliction of pain in\npolice cells can be kept secret, but not the existence of dead\nbodies.\n\nOn the moral wrongness of torture as compared to killing, the\nfollowing points can be made.\n\nFirst, torture is similar to killing in that both interrupt and render\nimpossible the normal conduct of human life, albeit the\nlatter \u2013 but not the former \u2013 necessarily forever. But equally\nduring the period a person is being tortured (and in some cases\nthereafter) the person\u2019s world is almost entirely taken up by\nextreme pain and their asymmetrical power relationship to the\ntorturer, i.e. the torture victim\u2019s powerlessness. Indeed, given\nthe extreme suffering being experienced and the consequent loss of\nautonomy, the victim would presumably rather be dead than alive during\nthat period. So, as already noted, torture is a very great evil.\nHowever, it does not follow from this that being killed is preferable\nto being tortured. Nor does it follow that torturing someone is\nmorally worse than killing him.\n\nIt does not follow that being killed is preferable to being tortured\nbecause the duration of the torture might be brief, one\u2019s will\nmight not ultimately be broken, and one might go on to live a long and\nhappy life; by contrast, being killed \u2013 theological considerations\naside \u2013 is always \u2018followed by\u2019 no life whatsoever.\nFor the same reason it does not follow that torturing a person is\nmorally worse than killing that person. If the harm brought about by\nan act of torture is a lesser evil than the harm done by an act of\nkilling then, other things being equal, the latter is morally worse\nthan the former.\n\nA second point pertains to the powerlessness of the victims of\ntorture. Dead people necessarily have no autonomy or power; so killing\npeople is an infringement of their right to autonomy as well as their\nright to\n life.[11]\n What of the victims of torture?\n\nThe person being tortured is for the duration of the torturing process\nphysically powerless in relation to the torturer. By\n\u201cphysically powerless\u201d two things are meant: the victim is\ndefenceless, i.e., the victim cannot prevent the torturer from\ntorturing the victim, and the victim is unable to attack, and\ntherefore physically harm, the torturer. Nevertheless, it does not\nfollow from this that the victim is entirely powerless\nvis-\u00e0-vis the torturer. For the victim might be able to\nstrongly influence the torturer\u2019s actions, either by virtue of\nhaving at this time the power to harm people other than the torturer,\nor by virtue of having at some future time the power to defend\nhim/herself against the torturer, and/or attack the torturer. Consider\nthe clich\u00e9d example of the terrorist who is refusing to\ndisclose to the torturer the whereabouts of a bomb with a timing\ndevice which is about to explode in a crowded market-place. Perhaps\nthe terrorist could negotiate the cessation of torture and immunity\nfor himself, if he talks. Consider also a situation in which both a\nhostage and his torturer know that it is only a matter of an hour\nbefore the police arrive, free the hostage and arrest the torturer;\nperhaps the hostage is a defence official who is refusing to disclose\nthe whereabouts of important military documents and who is\nstrengthened in his resolve by this knowledge of the limited duration\nof the pain being inflicted upon him.\n\nThe conclusion to be drawn from these considerations is that torture\nis not necessarily morally worse than killing (or more undesirable\nthan death), though in many instances it may well be. Killing is an\ninfringement of the right to life and the right to autonomy. Torture\nis an infringement of the right to autonomy, but not necessarily of\nthe right to life. Moreover, torture is consistent with the retrieval\nof the victim\u2019s autonomy, whereas killing is not. On the other\nhand, the period during which the victim is being tortured is surely\nworse than not being alive during that time, and torture can in\nprinciple extend for the duration of the remainder of a person\u2019s\nlife. Further, according to our adopted definition, torture is an\nintentional or purposive attack on a person\u2019s autonomy; this is\nnot necessarily the case with\n killing.[12]\n Finally, torture can in principle involve the effective destruction\nof a person\u2019s autonomy.\n\nLet us now turn directly to the question of the moral justification\nfor torture in extreme emergencies. Here we must distinguish between\none-off cases of torture, on the one hand, and legalised or\ninstitutionalised torture, on the other.\n",
