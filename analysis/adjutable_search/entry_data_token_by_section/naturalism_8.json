    "main_text": "Methodological Naturalism || Philosophy and Science\n2.1 Philosophy and Science\nIn what follows, \u201cmethodological naturalism\u201d will be\nunderstood as a view about philosophical practice. Methodological\nnaturalists see philosophy and science as engaged in essentially the\nsame enterprise, pursuing similar ends and using similar methods.\nAmong philosophers of religion, \u201cmethodological\nnaturalism\u201d is sometimes understood differently, as a thesis about natural\nscientific method itself, not about philosophical method. In this\nsense, \u201cmethodological naturalism\u201d is the view that religious\ncommitments have no relevance within science: natural science itself\nrequires no specific attitude to religion, and can be practised just\nas well by adherents of religious faiths as by atheists or agnostics\n(Draper 2005). This thesis is of interest to philosophers of religion\nbecause many of them want to deny that methodological naturalism in\nthis sense entails \u201cphilosophical naturalism\u201d, understood\nas atheism or agnosticism. You can practice natural science in just\nthe same way as non-believers, so this line of thought goes, yet\nremain a believer when it comes to religious questions. Not all defenders of religious belief endorse this kind of\n\u201cmethodological naturalism\u201d, however. Some think that religious\ndoctrines do make a difference to scientific practice, yet are\ndefensible for all that (Plantinga 1996). In any case, this kind of\n\u201cmethodological naturalism\u201d will not be discussed further\nhere. Our focus will be on the relation between philosophy and\nscience, not between religion and science.\nWhat exactly is involved in adopting a methodologically naturalist attitude to the relation between philosophy and science? In order to focus what follows, let us understand methodological naturalism as the specific claim that philosophy and science are both concerned to establish\nsynthetic knowledge about the natural world, and moreover to achieve\nthis by a posteriori investigation.\nMethodological naturalists will of course allow that\nthere are some differences between philosophy and science. But they\nwill say that these are relatively superficial, a matter of focusing on different\nquestions rather than any radical difference of approach. For one thing, philosophical questions are often\ndistinguished by their great generality. Where scientists think about\nviruses, electrons or stars, philosophers think about spatiotemporal\ncontinuants, properties, causation or time, categories that\nstructure all our thinking about the natural world. Another common feature of philosophical questions is that they involve some kind of\ntheoretical tangle. Our thinking supports different lines of thought that lead\nto conflicting conclusions. Progress requires an unravelling of\npremises, including perhaps an unearthing of implicit assumptions\nthat we didn\u2019t realize we had.\nFor both these reasons, philosophical issues are rarely resolved by new observational data. The normal philosophical predicament is that we have all the observational data we could want, but aren\u2019t sure of the best way of accommodating them. Still, methodological naturalists will urge, this doesn\u2019t mean that a posteriori synthetic theories are not the aim of philosophy. A theory produced by unravelling the theoretical tangles surrounding some general category can still be an a posteriori synthetic theory, even if no new observational findings went into its construction.\nFrom the methodological naturalist perspective, then, philosophical views are synthetic claims that answer to the overall tribunal of a posteriori observational evidence. The obvious objection to this view, however, is that it does not accord with philosophical practice. In particular, it seems in tension with the central role that intuitions play in philosophy. The typical way to assess philosophical views is arguably to test them against intuitive judgements about possible cases, not against a posteriori observational data. So, for example, the description theory of names is challenged by our intuitions about Kripke\u2019s imagined counterexamples, the tripartite theory of knowledge by our intuitive reactions to Gettier cases, and so on. At first pass, this certainly suggests that philosophy is centrally concerned with the analysis of everyday concepts, not the construction of synthetic theories: it is using intuitions about possible cases to uncover the structure implicit in our concepts. The reliance on intuitions thus argues that, far from delivering synthetic a posteriori knowledge, philosophy uses a priori methods to deliver analytic conclusions.\nMethodological naturalists can respond to this challenge at a number of points. For one thing, they can ask whether intuitions really do play a central role in philosophy. For another, they can query whether, even if they do, they are really a priori intuitions. And finally, they can dispute whether, even if the intuitions are a priori, they are genuinely analytic. It will be convenient to consider these different responses in reverse order.\n",
