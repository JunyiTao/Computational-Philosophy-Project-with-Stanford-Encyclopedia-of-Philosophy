    "main_text": "Consciousness\n7. Consciousness\n\n\nPlace answered the question \u2018Is Consciousness a Brain\nProcess?\u2019 in the affirmative. But what sort of brain process? It\nis natural to feel that there is something ineffable about which no\nmere neurophysiological process (with only physical intrinsic\nproperties) could have. There is a challenge to the identity theorist\nto dispel this feeling. \n\n\nSuppose that I am riding my bicycle from my home to the university.\nSuddenly I realise that I have crossed a bridge over a creek, gone\nalong a twisty path for half a mile, avoided oncoming traffic, and so\non, and yet have no memories of all this. In one sense I was conscious:\nI was perceiving, getting information about my position and speed, the\nstate of the bicycle track and the road, the positions and speeds of\napproaching cars, the width of the familiar narrow bridge. But in\nanother sense I was not conscious: I was on \u2018automatic\npilot\u2019. So let me use the word \u2018awareness\u2019 for this\nautomatic or subconscious sort of consciousness. Perhaps I am not one\nhundred percent on automatic pilot. For one thing I might be absent\nminded and thinking about philosophy. Still, this would not be relevant\nto my bicycle riding. One might indeed wonder whether one is ever one\nhundred percent on automatic pilot, and perhaps one hopes that one\nisn't, especially in Armstrong's example of the long distance truck\ndriver (Armstrong 1962). Still it probably does happen, and if it does\nthe driver is conscious only in the sense that he or she is alert to\nthe route, of oncoming traffic etc., i.e. is perceiving in the sense of\n\u2018coming to believe by means of the senses\u2019. The driver gets\nthe beliefs but is not aware of doing so. There is no suggestion of\nineffability in this sense of \u2018consciousness\u2019, for which I\nshall reserve the term \u2018awareness\u2019.\n\n\nFor the full consciousness, the one that puzzles us and suggests\nineffability, we need the sense elucidated by Armstrong in a debate\nwith Norman Malcolm (Armstrong and Malcolm 1962, p. 110). Somewhat\nsimilar views have been expressed by other philosophers, such as Savage\n(1976), Dennett (1991), Lycan (1996), Rosenthal (1996). A recent\npresentation of it is in Smart (2004). In the debate with Norman\nMalcolm, Armstrong compared consciousness with proprioception. A case\nof proprioception occurs when with our eyes shut and without touch we\nare immediately aware of the angle at which one of our elbows is bent.\nThat is, proprioception is a special sense, different from that of\nbodily sensation, in which we become aware of parts of our body. Now\nthe brain is part of our body and so perhaps immediate awareness of a\nprocess in, or a state of, our brain may here for present purposes be\ncalled \u2018proprioception\u2019. Thus the proprioception even\nthough the neuroanatomy is different. Thus the proprioception which\nconstitutes consciousness, as distinguished from mere awareness, is a\nhigher order awareness, a perception of one part of (or configuration\nin) our brain by the brain itself. Some may sense circularity here. If\nso let them suppose that the proprioception occurs in an in practice\nnegligible time after the process propriocepted. Then perhaps there can\nbe proprioceptions of proprioceptions, proprioceptions of\nproprioceptions of proprioceptions, and so on up, though in fact the\nsequence will probably not go up more than two or three steps. The last\nproprioception in the sequence will not be propriocepted, and this may\nhelp to explain our sense of the ineffability of consciousness. Compare\nGilbert Ryle in The Concept of Mind on the systematic\nelusiveness of \u2018I\u2019 (Ryle 1949, pp. 195\u20138).\n\n\nPlace has argued that the function of the \u2018automatic\npilot\u2019, to which he refers as \u2018the zombie within\u2019, is\nto alert consciousness to inputs which it identifies as problematic,\nwhile it ignores non-problematic inputs or re-routes them to output\nwithout the need for conscious awareness. For this view of\nconsciousness see Place (1999).\n",
