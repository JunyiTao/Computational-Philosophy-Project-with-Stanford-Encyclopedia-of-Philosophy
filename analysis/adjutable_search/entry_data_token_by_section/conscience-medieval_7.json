    "main_text": "The Later-Scholastic Tradition || St Thomas Aquinas: Synderesis and Conscience as Cognitive\n3.2 St Thomas Aquinas: Synderesis and Conscience as Cognitive\n\nThomas Aquinas (1224/25\u20131274) is, by any measure, one of the\nmost important, if not the most important, scholastic theologian of\nthe later Middle Ages. Although his views on conscience and synderesis\nhave received less attention in recent years than his theory of\nnatural law, this is unjustified. For the scholastics, a full account\nof morality includes not only an explanation of how practical norms\nare grounded, but also an understanding of how they are grasped and\nhow it is that rational agents, despite possessing an infallible guide\nto such knowledge, often fail to apply it. One\u2019s metaethics, in\nother words, is inextricably linked to one\u2019s moral psychology,\nwhich is to say, to one\u2019s understanding of how the will and the\nintellect interact with one\u2019s knowledge of right and wrong.\n\nAquinas discussed the issues of synderesis and conscience in several\nof his major works, from his early commentary on the\nSentences and the De veritate to his mature\nSumma theologica (see D\u2019Arcy 1961: 36\u201347). As\nmight be expected, his account is very different from that of his\nFranciscan contemporary Bonaventure. For one thing, Bonaventure\nassigns synderesis to the will. He also describes it, as we saw above,\nas a \u201chabit-like faculty\u201d. Aquinas, as might be expected,\nhews much closer to his Dominican mentor and teacher Albert the Great\n(ca. 1200\u20131280) for whom both synderesis and conscience belong\nto the intellect (see Dougherty 2018: 221).\n\nFor Aquinas, the rational part of the soul comprises the faculties or\npowers of intellect and will. The object of the will is the good, and\nthe object of the intellect is the true. The latter potency is further\ndivided into the speculative intellect (intellectus\nspeculativus) and the practical intellect (intellectus\npracticus). How do these differ? The object of the speculative\nintellect is truth as such, while the object of the practical\nintellect is the good \u201cunder the aspect of truth\u201d (Thomas\nAquinas, Summa theologica I, q. 79, a. 11, ad. 2). Synderesis\nand conscience, for Aquinas, both belong to the practical\nintellect.\n\nAll reasoning must start from immediately evident principles if an\ninfinite regress is to be avoided. This is as true in the realm of\npractical reason as it is in the realm of speculative reason. Once\nsuch principles have been grasped and assented to, more specific\nconclusions can be deduced. How are these principles grasped? In the\ndomain of speculative reason, they are apprehended by the innate\ndisposition that Aquinas calls\nintellectus\u2014\u201cintuitive reason\u201d or\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d\u2014and that Aristotle called\nnous. The objects of this habit are such self-evident\npropositions as that \u201cevery whole is greater than its\npart\u201d and that \u201cthings equal to one and the same are equal\nto one another\u201d (Summa theologica I-II, q 94, a. 2,\ncorp.). Once their terms are known, the intellect immediately grasps\nthe truth of such propositions since they are analytic in nature. The\ncorresponding habit in the domain of practical reason, on the other\nhand, is synderesis: a property of the soul which can never be lost,\nwhich never errs, and whose objects are the first principles of the\nnatural law (De veritate 16.1, corp.). A good description of\nhow Aquinas understands synderesis is Hoffmann\u2019s, who calls it\nan \u201cinfallible moral awareness\u201d (Hoffmann 2012: 255). Like\nunderstanding, synderesis is innate:\n\n\nWherefore the first practical principles, bestowed on us by nature, do\nnot belong to a special power, but to a special natural habit, which\nwe call \u201csynderesis\u201d. Whence \u201csynderesis\u201d is\nsaid to incite to good, and to murmur at evil, inasmuch as through\nfirst principles we proceed to discover, and judge of what we have\ndiscovered. It is therefore clear that \u201csynderesis\u201d is not\na power, but a natural habit. (Summa theologica I, q. 79, a.\n12, corp.)\n\n\nIn broad terms, synderesis is a link between the human intellect and\nthe divine wisdom. The universe is created and governed by a\nprovidential God and is therefore subject to the order of final\ncausality. Accordingly, all things, rational and non-rational alike,\nseek their proper ends. Non-rational beings, since they lack will and\nintellect and are therefore incapable of prudential reasoning, achieve\ntheir ends through the natural inclinations that are implanted in them\nby God. In this sense, they participate in the providential plan for\nall creation that Aquinas calls the \u201ceternal law\u201d: the\ndivine wisdom insofar as it directs all creatures towards their ends\n(Summa theologica I-II, q. 93, a. 1, corp.). They do so,\nhowever, in a diminished way. Rational beings, by contrast,\nparticipate in divine providence in a more excellent way. This\nparticipation in the eternal law is called the natural law, whose\nmoral principles function to direct human beings toward their ultimate\nend: happiness (Summa theologica, I-II, q. 91, a. 2, corp.).\nThese moral principles, which are grasped and accordingly possessed by\nsynderesis, offer an insight into God\u2019s intentions for human\nbeings and therefore into the ultimate purpose of human life. As\nBaylor writes of Aquinas\u2019s theory:\n\n\nMoral principles are based upon and derived from a rationality that is\npresent in reality; they are a human knowledge of the exemplary ideas\nin the divine mind according to which creation is imbued with a\nrational order. (Baylor 1977: 46)\n\n\nPractical reasoning, then, plays a central role in the achievement of\nhappiness, the final end for humans, and therefore in God\u2019s plan\nfor us. Like speculative reasoning, practical reasoning generally\ntakes a deductive form. Just as science is the conclusion of the\ndemonstrative syllogism, so conscience is the conclusion of a\npractical syllogism. The practical syllogism, like the demonstrative\nsyllogism, contains a major premise, a minor premise and a conclusion.\nThe major premise is drawn or deduced from synderesis. The minor\npremise, on the other hand, is drawn either from faith, natural reason\nor human positive law. From the major and minor premises, a conclusion\nis drawn that generates a moral obligation to act (Hoffmann 2012:\n258). This inferential judgment is associated, for Aquinas, with\nconscience: an act\u2014as opposed to a faculty or a habit\u2014that\nincludes a number of applications, such as \u201cto witness, to bind,\nor incite, and also to accuse, torment, or rebuke\u201d (Thomas\nAquinas, Summa theologica I, q. 79, a. 13, corp.).\n\nConscience acts as a \u201cwitness\u201d when it is consciously\naware of some personal wrongdoing, whether of commission or omission.\nIt \u201cbinds\u201d or \u201cincites\u201d when it makes a\njudgement that some act should be performed. Finally, it\n\u201caccuses\u201d, \u201ctorments\u201d or \u201crebukes\u201d\nwhen it judges that some past action was either morally acceptable or\nit was not. Although it is difficult to see how conscience in the\nfirst sense\u2014conscience as witness\u2014can function as an\napplication of knowledge to conduct, this seems less problematic in\nthe second and third senses of the term, which harken back to the\nlegislative and judicial senses of conscience found in St. Paul and\npagan antiquity, respectively (D\u2019Arcy 1961: 46). In any case, an\nexample of the way in which conscience applies the natural\nlaw\u2014whose principles are apprehended by synderesis\u2014 is\narticulated in Aquinas\u2019s De veritate:\n\n\nIf the judgement of synderesis expresses the statement: \u201cnothing\nprohibited by the law of God is to be done\u201d, and if the\nknowledge of higher reason presents this minor premise \u201csexual\nintercourse with this woman is forbidden by the law of God\u201d, the\napplication of conscience will be made by concluding: \u201cthis\nsexual intercourse is to be avoided\u201d. (De veritate, q.\n17, a. 2, corp.; cited in Dougherty 2018: 222)\n\n\nNow the dictates of conscience can either be right, if correctly\ndeduced from the natural law, or wrong, if they are incorrectly\ndeduced. The dictates of the former are the product of a\n\u201ccorrect conscience\u201d and the judgements of the latter are\nthe result of an \u201cerroneous conscience\u201d. Since synderesis\nis infallible, the main source of an erroneous conscience, when it\ndoes occur, is the agent\u2019s adoption of a faulty minor premise in\nthe practical syllogism (De veritate q. 17, a. 2; Potts\ntrans. 1980: 132\u2013133).\n\nNow it is clear that we have an obligation to follow a correct\nconscience since to do so contributes to achieving our final end. But\nwhat of an erroneous conscience? Does this have any authority? For\nAquinas, an erring conscience also binds. It does not, however,\nnecessarily excuse. As Hoffmann puts it,\n\n\nregardless of whether my action is objectively good, evil or\nindifferent, conscience binds, for it is by means of conscience that\nan action is proposed to me as good, bad, or indifferent. (Hoffmann\n2012: 260)\n\n\nFor example, it is objectively right\u2014in accordance with the\nnatural law\u2014to refrain from sex outside of marriage. But suppose\nthat an agent (mistakenly) believes that such abstinence is sinful,\nand yet still refrains. According to Aquinas, this agent, although he\ndoes what is objectively right, nonetheless sins. Why? Because in\nchoosing the opposite of what his conscience dictated, he chose to do\nsomething he believed to be evil. And choosing what is (subjectively\nif not objectively) wrong, for Aquinas, is a sin: \u201c[F] from the\nvery fact that a thing is proposed by the reason as being evil, the\nwill by tending thereto becomes evil\u201d (Summa\ntheologica, I-II, q. 19, a. 5, corp.).\n\nWhat follows from this is that conscience, whether right or erroneous,\nalways binds. As to the question of whether an erroneous conscience\nexcuses, on the other hand, that depends on the type of ignorance that\ncauses it. This is because some types of ignorance render an act\ninvoluntary and therefore excusable, and some do not. Ignorance that\nexcuses is called invincible, and concerns ignorance about the facts\nof the situation (assuming, of course, there is no negligence\ninvolved). Such cases, that is, where an agent could not have known\nbetter under the circumstances and would not have thus acted had he\nknown better, are excusable. Aquinas uses the example of\nfornication\u2014voluntary, illicit sex\u2014to illustrate his\npoint. Although it is a sin to commit adultery, a man is excused if he\nhas sexual relations with a woman who is not his wife, so long as he\nis genuinely, if improbably, mistakes the women for his wife. This\nis\n\n\nbecause this error arises from ignorance of a circumstance, which\nignorance excuses, and causes the act to be involuntary. (Summa\ntheologica I-II, q. 19, a. 6, corp.)\n\n\nIgnorance that contributes to an erroneous conscience that is in any\nway voluntary is vincible, or able to be corrected, and therefore\nculpable if followed. This generally happens where the agent\u2019s\nignorance of the particulars of the situation is either the result of\nnegligence, or where there is ignorance of the relevant moral\nprinciples. The former cases are the result of the agent not taking\nappropriate care to find out about the facts of situation so that he\nor she can sin while feigning ignorance. In the case of one\u2019s\nignorance of universal premises, this too is culpable since it is\none\u2019s obligation to know the moral law. (Summa\ntheologica I-II, q. 19, a. 6, corp.).\n\nBut one might be wondering how it is that culpable ignorance is even\npossible where it relates to general moral principles. How can one go\nwrong about the universal premises that form the major premise of the\npractical syllogism, which are drawn from the precepts which comprise\nthe natural law, if synderesis, which grasps such premises, is\ninfallible? Aquinas\u2019s answer is that there are two types of\nnatural law precepts: primary\u2014or those which are \u201cmost\ngeneral\u201d\u2014and secondary. Aquinas is less specific on this\ntopic than is optimal, but in drawing this distinction he seems to\nmean something like the following. About the primary precepts of the\nnatural law, no-one can go wrong. Unfortunately, as we have seen, such\nprecepts are of a very general character, such as \u201cdo good and\navoid evil\u201d. For such general knowledge to be applicable by\nconscience, it must be further specified. This further specification\ncomprises the secondary precepts of the natural law, which are closely\ndrawn from the former precepts and from natural inclination. About\nsuch secondary, derived precepts of the natural law, such as\n\u201cadultery is to be avoided\u201d, humans are all too prone to\nbecome ignorant. For Aquinas such ignorance is the result either of\nvice or of having been socialized in a culture with \u201cvicious\ncustoms\u201d:\n\n\nI answer that [\u2026] there belongs to the natural law, first,\ncertain most general precepts, that are known to all; and secondly,\ncertain secondary and more detailed precepts, which are, as it were,\nconclusions following closely from first principles. As to those\ngeneral principles, the natural law, in the abstract, can nowise be\nblotted out from men\u2019s hearts. [\u2026] But as to [\u2026] the\nsecondary precepts, the natural law can be blotted out from the human\nheart, either by evil persuasions, just as in speculative matters\nerrors occur in respect of necessary conclusions; or by vicious\ncustoms and corrupt habits [\u2026]. (Summa theologica\nI-II, q. 94, a. 6, corp.)\n\n\nA final problem seems to emerge: are we not, according to\nAquinas\u2019s account of the erroneous conscience, left with the\npossibility of a moral dilemma? For if we have an obligation to always\nfollow our consciences, but we sometimes sin when we do follow them,\nthen it seems that we are sometimes put into a double bind. We seem,\nthat is, to sometimes have conflicting obligations so that regardless\nof what we do, we sin. Aquinas\u2019s solution is that it is only\nwrong to follow a conscience that is in a state of vincible ignorance.\nSince such ignorance is by definition correctable, we can always\nresolve the apparent dilemma by choosing to put aside our ignorance.\nAs far as acting from invincible ignorance is concerned, we are\npardoned.\n",
