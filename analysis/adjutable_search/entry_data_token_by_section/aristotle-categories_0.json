    "main_text": "The Four-Fold Division\n1. The Four-Fold Division\n\nThe Categories divides naturally into three distinct parts\n\u2014 what have come to be known as the Pre-Predicamenta\n(chs.1\u20134), the Predicamenta (chs. 5\u20139), and the\nPost-Predicamenta (chs. 10-15). (These section titles reflect\nthe traditional Latin title of the entire work, the\nPredicamenta.) In the Pre-Predicamenta, Aristotle\ndiscusses a number of semantic relations (1a1\u201316), gives a\ndivision of beings (\u03c4\u1f03 \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1), into four\nkinds (1a20\u20131b9), and then presents his canonical list of ten\ncategories (1b25\u20132a4). In the Predicamenta, Aristotle\ndiscusses in detail the categories of substance (2a12\u20134b19),\nquantity (4b20\u20136a36), relatives (6a37\u20138b24), and quality\n(8b25\u201311a39), and provides a cursory treatment of the other\ncategories (11b1\u201314). And finally, in the\nPost-Predicamenta, he discusses a number of concepts relating\nto modes of opposition (11b15\u201314A25), priority and simultaneity\n(14a26\u201315a13), motion (15a14\u201315b17), and ends with a brief\ndiscussion of having (15b18\u201331). There is considerable debate\nabout whether Aristotle thought all three parts belong to a single\nwork, and if he did, why he thought they are all needed for the work\nto be a unified whole. There is nonetheless widespread agreement that\nat the very heart of the Categories are two systems of\nclassification, one given in the Pre-Predicamenta, and the\nother in the Predicamenta.\n\nAristotle\u2019s first system of classification is of beings,\n(\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1) (1a20). The division proceeds\nby way of two concepts: (1) said-of and (2) present-in. Any being,\naccording to Aristotle, is either said-of another or is not said-of\nanother. Likewise, any being is either present-in another or is not\npresent-in another. Because these are technical notions, one would\nexpect Aristotle to have defined them. Unfortunately, he does not\ndefine the said-of relation; and his definition of the present-in\nrelation is either circular or rests on an undefined concept of being\nin. He says: \u2018By \u201cpresent in a subject\u201d I mean what\nis in something, not as a part, and cannot exist separately from what\nit is in\u2019 (1a24\u20135). Notice that the word \u2018in\u2019\noccurs in this definition of present-in. So, either \u2018in\u2019\nmeans the same as \u2018present-in\u2019, in which case the\ndefinition is circular; or \u2018in\u2019 is itself in need of a\ndefinition, which Aristotle does not give. Hence, Aristotle\u2019s\nfirst system of classification rests on technical concepts whose\nprecise characterization is not settled by anything Aristotle\nsays.\n\nDespite the lack of helpful definitions of these two concepts, there\nis a fairly straightforward, though certainly not uncontroversial,\ncharacterization of them that many scholars have adopted. By focusing\non Aristotle\u2019s illustrations, most scholars conclude that beings\nthat are said-of others are universals, while those that are not\nsaid-of others are particulars. Beings that are present-in others are\naccidental, while those that are not present-in others are\nnon-accidental. Now, non-accidental beings that are universals are\nmost naturally described as essential, while non-accidental beings\nthat are particulars are best described simply as non-accidental. If\nwe put these possibilities together, we arrive at the following\nfour-fold system of classification: (1) accidental universals; (2)\nessential universals; (3) accidental particulars; (4) non-accidental\nparticulars, or what Aristotle calls primary substances. This\nsystem maps readily onto Aristotle\u2019s own terminology, given at\n1a20: (1) Said-of and present-in: accidental universals; (2) Said-of\nand not present-in: essential universals; (3) Not said-of and\npresent-in: accidental particulars; and (4) Not said-of and not\npresent-in: primary substances. A brief discussion of each of these\nclasses should suffice to bring out their general character.\n",
