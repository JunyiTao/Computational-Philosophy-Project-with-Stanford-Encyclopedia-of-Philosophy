The second concerns the role of such\nimitation in the musical expression of emotions. Over the course of\nthe eighteenth century, answers to both questions were characterized\nby a growing skepticism toward imitation (see Lippman 1992: chapter\n6). The gradual rise of instrumental music was certainly partly\nresponsible for this change in attitude. Its increasing formal,\nmelodic, and harmonic complexity made it less plausible to argue that\nit imitated the speaking voice, and yet this complexity only\nheightened music\u2019s power to express and arouse the emotions.\n\nA natural way out of this impasse is to explicitly define expression\nin terms of emotional arousal, distinguishing it from the mere musical\ndepiction of worldly objects, including the external manifestations of\nhuman emotions. This is the option taken by Charles Avison\n(1709\u20131770) in his Essay on Musical Expression, first\npublished in 1752. Avison distinguishes between music resembling\nextra-musical objects, including manifestations of emotions, such as\nlaughter, and music that is able to provoke an emotional response in\nthe listener. The former case is musical \u2018imitation\u2019,\nwhich Avison claims produces \u201ca reflex act of the\nunderstanding\u201d (Avison 1775: 50), while the latter is\n\u2018expression\u2019. Avison argues that the goal of music is to\npursue expression, which is achieved by the competent use of melody\nand harmony. While the idea that music is valuable because it moves\nthe listener was not new, Avison\u2019s clarity in decoupling it from\nimitation is noteworthy.\n\nHowever, other theorists were not as explicit and careful as Avison\nwith their terminology, nor as ready to jettison imitation, which the\neighteenth century considered essential to the fine arts. Moreover, it\nhad been customary since the Camerata\u2019s time to construe\nexpression as dependent on imitation (see Palisca 2006: chapter 10).\nThus, a number of authors adopted conservative positions, defending a\nqualified concept of musical imitation, or simply accepting that\nmusic\u2019s imitative capacities are limited. In the second half of\nthe century, imitation gradually took on a more peripheral role, and\nphilosophers started to focus on alternative sources of value for\nmusic as an art, from formal structure to emotional arousal.\n\nThis gradual rejection of the idea of music as an imitative art is\nperhaps best manifested in France. This might seem puzzling, as the\neighteenth century view of imitation as the hallmark of fine arts\nfound its most famous expression in The Fine Arts Reduced to a\nSingle Principle (1746), by Charles Batteux (1713\u20131780). In\nthis work, Batteux defines art as the imitation of beautiful nature\n(belle nature). Different arts imitate different parts of\nnature. Music imitates the human expression of emotions. It is\ninteresting to note that Batteux repeatedly states that music\nexpresses the emotions, as opposed to imitating them,\nalthough the discrepancy seems to be merely terminological. Batteux\ncan conceive of music that fails to be imitative, but does not\nconsider it valuable:\n\n\nIt would be like a chromatic harpsichord that offers us colours and\nseries of colours. It would amuse the eyes, perhaps, but bore the\nmind. (Batteux 1746: part III, section III, chapter 2)\n\n\nEarlier than Batteux, Jean-Baptiste Du Bos (1670\u20131742) had\nsimilarly construed music as an imitative art in his Critical\nReflections on Poetry and Painting (1719). Du Bos attempts to\nshow that, in vocal music, melody, harmony, and rhythm all contribute\nto the imitation of impassioned speech. Instrumental music imitates\nnatural sounds instead. While he recognizes that music may charm the\nsenses, Du Bos thinks that the only valuable response to music is the\none that comes from its appreciation as an imitation. Music may still\nplease without imitating, but it is only when it imitates that it\nreally moves. Consequently, Du Bos condemns music that fails to be\nimitative.\n\nThe Encyclopedists Jean Le Rond D\u2019Alembert (1717\u20131783) and\nDidier Diderot (1713\u20131784) also hold onto the idea that music is\nessentially imitative. D\u2019Alembert states that\n\n\n[t]he composers of instrumental music will make nothing but an empty\nnoise as long as they do not have in their heads [\u2026] an action\nor an expression to be represented. (D\u2019Alembert 1759:\nXXXVIII)\n\n\nIn the dialogue Rameau\u2019s Nephew (1760), Diderot claims\nthat\n\n\n[s]ong is an imitation of physical noises or of the accents of the\npassions, through the sounds of a scale invented by art or inspired by\nnature, whichever you please, either with the voice or with an\ninstrument. (Diderot 1760: 104ndash;5)\n\n\nMusical imitation is also defended by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but in an\nimportantly qualified version (see the following section).\n\nFrom the 1770s onwards, the view of music as an imitative art appears\nincreasingly untenable, and the idea that music is expressive of the\nemotions because it imitates human expressive behavior also comes\nunder attack. This new trend is evident in works such as Andr\u00e9\nMorellet\u2019s (1727\u20131819) Of Expression in Music and\nImitation in the Arts (1771), as well as Musical Expression\nPlaced Among the Chimeras (1779). This latter work was written by\nBoy\u00e9, whose biographical details are unknown.\nBoy\u00e9\u2019s treatise pairs the rejection of imitation with the\nclaim that melody and harmony are worthy of appreciation in\nthemselves:\n\n\nThe principal object of music is to please us physically, without the\nmind putting itself to the trouble of searching for useless\ncomparisons to it. (quoted in Lippman 1992: 95)\n\n\nThe composer and theorist Michel-Paul Guy de Chabanon\n(1730\u20131792) is arguably the most representative and radical\nexample of the new skeptical mentality. In his Observations on\nMusic and Principally on the Metaphysics of Art (1779), Chabanon\noffers a variety of arguments against the idea that the musical\nexpression of emotions depends on the imitation of their vocal\nmanifestations. Children respond emotionally to music, he observes,\nyet they cannot appreciate musical imitation. The same is true of\nindividuals who are unfamiliar with the Western musical tradition.\nMoreover, imitation is insufficient for expression. For example,\nlaughter is naturally associated with gaiety, but a musical imitation\nof laughter would fail to result in gay music. Thus, music may express\nemotions without imitating their external manifestations. Conversely,\nChabanon observes that music may express emotions that do not have any\ntypical manifestation:\n\n\nMany of our passions have no particular cry associated with them, and\nyet music may express them. (Chabanon 1779: VIII)\n\n\nIn addition to the already mentioned Avison, other English writers\nquestioned the role of imitation in music (see Schueller 1948).\nFrancis Hutcheson (1694\u20131746), in An Inquiry concerning\nBeauty, Order, Harmony, Design (1725), distinguishes between\noriginal and comparative beauty, the former being judged independently\nof any comparison, with the latter depending instead on imitation.\nAccording to Hutcheson, music is an example of original beauty,\nalthough its melodic element also allows for comparative beauty, in\nthat it may resemble impassioned speech. In detecting this\nresemblance,\n\n\nwe shall be touched by it in a very sensible manner, and have\nmelancholy, joy, gravity, thoughtfulness excited in us by a sort of\nsympathy or contagion. (Hutcheson 1725: section VI,\nXII)\n\n\nThis passage is significant because it gives a clear account of how\nmusic may express an emotion (through the imitation of its\ncharacteristic vocal expression), while at the same time arousing it\nin the listener.\n\nIn his Observations on the Correspondence between Poetry and\nMusic (1769), the Irish writer Daniel Webb (1719\u20131798)\nexplains the emotional effects of music by appealing to a\nphysiological theory of emotions similar to Descartes\u2019s.\nAccording to this view, music may give us impressions, that\nis, it may put us in a state of mind, which may be further specified\nby accompanying words. In comparing music with painting and sculpture,\nWebb notes that the latter may act on our emotions only through their\nimitations, that is, their represented content, whereas music may do\nso through both imitations and impressions (Webb 1769: 28). In this\nway, Webb acknowledges that the expressive potential of music is\ngreater than that of the visual arts, and that this privileged\nposition is not due to imitation.\n\nJames Beattie (1735\u20131803), a Scottish philosopher, voices\nconcerns similar to those of Chabanon when he observes that there are\nemotions that music may express, that do not have a typical vocal\nmanifestation. On the basis of this, he rejects the view that music is\nof necessity imitative, though he concedes that it may be. More\nsignificantly, Beattie claims that there is a crucial difference\nbetween music and the paradigmatically imitative art of painting.\nWhile good paintings are of necessity good imitations, and bad\npaintings are necessarily bad ones, good and bad works of music may be\neither good or bad imitations (Beattie 1779: part I, chapter VI,\nsection 1).\n\nThe Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid (1710\u20131796) argues that\nperception presents us with sensations, which function as signs of\nobjective qualities. Some sensations are artificial signs,\ninstituted by human agreement. Such are words\u2014the connection\nbetween \u2018cat\u2019 and the animal sitting on my lap being\narbitrary. Other sensations are natural signs, and function\nindependently of human agency\u2014for instance, the connection\nbetween smoke and fire. Natural signs typically require us to learn\ntheir connection to the signified objective quality, as in the case of\nsmoke and fire. However, in some cases a natural sign signifies\nwithout requiring prior experience\u2014a child can detect the anger\nin an angry face and responds to it immediately. Musical expression is\nexplicitly described by Reid as an example of this category:\n\n\nOne kind of music inspires grief, another love, another rage or fury.\nThese are all material representations of some affection of the mind.\nNone of these are gained by experience. (Lectures on the Fine\nArts, \u201cMind and Body\u201d)\n\n\nThus, musical expression \u201cis nothing but the fitness of certain\nsounds to produce certain sentiments in our minds\u201d (Lectures\non the Fine Arts, \u201cTaste and the Fine Arts\u201d). As for\nthe imitation of birdsong, battles, and the like, Reid maintains that\nthese only marginally contribute to the beauty of music. The\nimportance of Reid\u2019s view resides in his philosophically\ngrounded view of expression, which does not involve imitation at\nall.\n\nThe economist and philosopher Adam Smith (1723\u201390) traces a\nsharp distinction between vocal and instrumental music. He holds that\nthe greater the disparity between medium and imitated object, the more\npleasure an imitative art will occasion (Of the Nature of that\nImitation that Takes Place in what are called The Imitative Arts,\npart I, 6\u20137). Vocal music may thus only slightly resemble\nimpassioned speech, but precisely because of this it will delight us\nwhen it successfully imitates it (Of the Nature of that\nImitation, part II, 12). Instrumental music, however, lacking a\ntext and deprived of vocal articulation, cannot imitate any object\nsuccessfully, as we can hardly ever recognize anything in it unless\nprompted by a description (Of the Nature of that Imitation,\npart II, 17). Smith develops an alternative view of musical\nexpression, which he illustrates with an interesting parallel. Just as\na natural landscape may be gloomy without imitating anything, so may\nmusic. In both cases the description \u2018gloomy\u2019 ascribes a\ndispositional property, that is, it refers to the capacity the\nlandscape and piece of music have of making us gloomy (Of the\nNature of that Imitation, part II, 23). Once more, expression and\nimitation go separate ways.\n\nAlthough perhaps less radically than their French or English\ncounterparts, German intellectuals also increasingly questioned the\nrole of imitation in music.\n\nThe philosopher and scientist Johann Georg Sulzer (1720\u20131779)\nstill adheres to a rather orthodox view of imitation in music, holding\nthat music imitates impassioned speech (Sulzer 1774,\n\u201cMelody\u201d [1792: III, 370\u2013371; 1995: 91\u201392]).\nHe also extends this account to instrumental music, and holds that\nmusic that fails to express emotions is worthless (Sulzer 1774,\n\u201cInstrumental music\u201d [1792: II, 677\u2013679; 1995:\n95\u201397]).\n\nJohann Mattheson (1681\u20131764), the chief Affektenlehre\ntheorist, embraces a Cartesian, physiological explanation of musical\nexpression as the arousal of emotion produced by music\u2019s action\non the animal spirits (this is the standard view of Mattheson\u2019s\ntheory\u2014see Lippman 1992: 115\u2013116; for an alternative\ninterpretation, see Kivy 1984). Thus, the musician who wishes to\ncompose music expressive of an emotion will have to conform to the\nmovements of the animal spirits associated with that emotion. This\nview alters the connection between emotional expression and imitation,\nas expression is no longer dependent on the imitation of impassioned\nspeech.\n\nJohann Gottfried von Herder (1744\u20131803) retains the idea that\nmusic is an imitative art, whose subjects are\n\n\nall such things and incidents as are most eminently characterized by\nmotion and sound; these include all species of motions, sounds,\nvoices, passions expressed through sounds, and so on. (Herder 1769: I,\n19)\n\n\nThis follows from the nature of music: whereas painting is the art of\nspatial coexistence, music is that of succession. It is by respecting\nthese natural boundaries that the arts may achieve their effects.\nThus,\n\n\nmusic, which works wholly through the succession of time, must never\nmake the depiction of objects in space its main object, as\ninexperienced bunglers do. (Herder 1769: I, 16)\n\n\nThere are similarities between Herder\u2019s philosophy of music and\nRousseau\u2019s. Herder also proposes that today\u2019s music and\nlanguage may have a common ancestor, the main function of which was\nexpressive (Herder 1772: part I, section III, 1; Herder 1769: IV,\n8).\n\nHerder is skeptical with regard to the role of mathematical or\nphysical explanations in musical aesthetics, as these fail to explain\nour first-person hedonic and emotional responses. Much like Rousseau,\nhe finds fault in Rameau on these grounds (Herder 1769: IV, 6).\nHowever, Herder does not abandon scientific explanations altogether,\nand in fact appeals to physiology to advance his own hypothesis\n(Herder 1769: IV, 6). While the details of this proposed explanation\nmight be uninteresting, it is noteworthy that, by appealing to a\ncausal explanation, Herder is weakening the link between expression\nand imitation.\n",
