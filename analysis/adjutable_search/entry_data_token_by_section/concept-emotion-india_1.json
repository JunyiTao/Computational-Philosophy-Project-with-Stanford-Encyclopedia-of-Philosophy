    "main_text": "The Ved\u0101nta account of the emotions\n2. The Ved\u0101nta account of the emotions\n\nIn his commentary on the Brahma-s\u016btras,\n\u015aa\u1e43kara makes the well-known argument that the self\n(\u0101tman) exists because its existence is the only way to\naccount for the idea of a subject of experience. This argument relies\non the idea that the self has certain mental qualities, which are\ntermed manas (mind), buddhi (intellect),\nvij\u00f1\u0101na (cognition) or citta\n(consciousness), depending on what mental function is ascribed to\nthem. Different mental functions are doubt, resolution, egoism or\nrecollection [BSBh 2.4.6]. These mental functions, regardless of how\nthey are referred to, have several qualities or modifications,\nincluding desire, imagination, doubt, faith, want of faith, memory,\nforgetfulness, shame, reflection and fear [BSBh 2.3.32] as well as\nlove, aversion, pleasure and pain [BSBh 2.3.29]. This means that,\naccording to \u015aa\u1e43kara, the mind\u2019s cognitive and\nemotional abilities are the qualities of our mental functioning which\nis different from the self.\n\nAt the heart of \u015aa\u1e43kara\u2019s teaching lies the notion\nthat the true knowledge of the \u0101tman is knowledge that\nis devoid of any of the above-mentioned qualities. In this respect one\ncan find a similarity between the Ny\u0101ya school and\n\u015aa\u1e43kara because for both of them cognitive and emotional\nqualities are due to false knowledge or ignorance of the true self.\nThis means that the removal of ignorance results in a removal of\nemotions as well as cognitions. However, it is clear that the emotions\npresent the main obstacle for the realization of the true self because\ndesire and aversion lead to attachment and clinging which cause us to\nneglect the search for liberation that is crucial to Ved\u0101nta\nteaching. So, while \u015aa\u1e43kara distinguishes between what\nWestern philosophers would call cognitions and emotions, he does not\npresent a purely cognitive state of mind without emotions as the ideal\nstate of mind because such a state would be impossible. By definition,\nany purely cognitive state of mind presupposes the existence of a mind\nor intellect. For \u015aa\u1e43kara, however, the problem is that a\nmind will always have certain qualities that would be called emotive\nin Western philosophy, such as desire, aversion, hatred, pleasure or\npain. So, as long there are cognitions, there will also be emotions.\nTherefore, both must be eliminated in order for the self to attain\nliberation. On this point, \u015aa\u1e43kara agrees with the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers. While \u015aa\u1e43kara\ndistinguishes between emotions and cognitions, his distinction is not\nas pronounced as that of the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nphilosophers. He regards both as qualities of the mind or\nintellect.\n",
