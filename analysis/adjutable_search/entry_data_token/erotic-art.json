What is Erotic Art?\n1.1 A Definition of Erotic Art\n\nIn Sex and Reason, Richard Posner proposes to use the word\n\u201cerotic\u201d to describe\n\n\npresentations and representations that are, or at least are taken by\nsome viewers to be, in some sense \u201cabout\u201d sexual activity.\n(Posner 1994: 351)\n\n\nThis characterization needs some narrowing down if one wants to arrive\nat a definition that captures the extension of what we ordinarily\nthink counts as erotic art. For one thing, an extensionally adequate\ndefinition should exclude scientific-behavioral studies or medical\nillustrations of sexual activity (which tend to be neither erotic nor\nartistic in nature). Furthermore, it\u2019s not the case, simply\nbecause some viewers take a painting or a sculpture to be about sexual\nactivity, that we are ipso facto dealing with an erotic\nrepresentation. Someone who is unfamiliar with the story of the\nChristian Bible might take a crucifixion painting to be a depiction of\na sado-masochistic act, but that would be insufficient grounds to\ncall, say, Tintoretto\u2019s Crucifixion\n(1565) a work of erotic art.\n\nPeter Webb\u2019s definition of erotic art as\n\n\nart on a sexual theme related specifically to emotions rather than\nmerely actions, and sexual depictions which are justifiable on\naesthetic grounds (Webb 1975: 2)\n\n\nis already closer to the mark. But even though Webb\u2019s emphasis\non emotions is understandable from an etymological point of\nview\u2014the term \u201cerotic\u201d derives from the Greek word\n\u201ceros\u201d meaning love or passion\u2014he does not succeed\nin spelling out the necessary or sufficient conditions for erotic art.\nMan Ray\u2019s photograph The Prayer\n(1930) shows only the hands, feet, and buttocks of a woman; it\nis not a sexual depiction in the strict sense and there is no show of\nemotions. Still, it is widely considered to be an erotic masterpiece.\nConversely, Ian McEwan\u2019s novella On Chesil\nBeach, set in the early 1960s and telling the story of a\nwedding night that goes horribly wrong, does qualify as \u201cart on\na sexual theme related specifically to emotions\u201d and yet it\nwould be misleading to label it as erotic literature.\n\nInstead of claiming that erotic art is about sexual feelings\nor desires, one could say that erotic art elicits sexual\nfeelings or desires. But this characterization would also be too\nbroad. A pious Madonna and Child painting may elicit sexual feelings\nor desires in some people, but that in and of itself does not make it\nerotic art. The intention to be sexually stimulating appears\ncrucial, as Jerrold Levinson acknowledges in his definition of erotic\nart as\n\n\nart which aims to engage viewers sexually through explicit sexual\ncontent, and that succeeds, to some extent, in doing so. (Levinson\n2006: 252)\n\n\nBut does erotic art need to be explicit? Take Nobuyoshi Araki\u2019s\nfamous close-up photograph of a woman\u2019s eye, sometimes entitled\nThe Look. The artist has tilted the\npicture 90 degrees to make it suggestive of female genitalia, thereby\nsoliciting sensuous feelings and associations in spectators. It is\nhighly erotic, though it has no explicit sexual content.\n\nA more adequate definition, and one that will be adhered to in this\narticle, is the following: erotic art is art that is made with the\nintention to stimulate its target audience sexually, and that succeeds\nto some extent in doing so. This raises the further question what\nsexual stimulation precisely entails. According to Guy Sircello (1979:\n119) it is the inducing of sexual feelings where the latter might be\n(1) feelings in our sexual parts, or (2) feelings in other erogenous\nparts\u2014typically generated by or generating feelings in sexual\nparts. However, a kick below the belt will give a man certain feelings\nin his sexual parts, but not of the sort that erotic art is supposed\nto bring about. So, an important qualification is needed. Sexual\nstimulation is probably best understood as the inducing of sexual\nfeelings, desires and imaginings, that would generally be regarded as\npleasant in themselves. Alternatively, one could adopt\nMatthew Kieran\u2019s nutshell definition of erotic art as art which\n\u201cessentially aims at eliciting sexual thoughts, feelings and\nassociations found to be arousing\u201d (2001: 32).\n1.2 Some Further Distinctions\n\nLevinson (2005) makes a useful distinction between erotic art and what\nhe calls erotica, that is, images intended to sexually\nstimulate but not to reward artistic interest (such as provocative\nlingerie ads). In general, it is good to keep in mind that the domain\nof erotic art only constitutes a small subsection of the much larger\nclass of items that are called erotic (erotic massages, erotic games,\nerotic toys, etc.). Erotic art also seems to fall within the broader\ncategory of sexually themed art. All works of erotic art have\na sexual theme, it could be argued, but not the other way around: many\nartworks with a sexual theme are not works of erotic art. Ian\nMcEwan\u2019s On Chesil Beach has already been mentioned.\nAnother example might be Tracey Emin\u2019s Is\nAnal Sex Legal? (1998), which simply consists of that\nquestion writ large in pink neon light. (The piece is usually\nexhibited together with its complement, Is Legal\nSex Anal? also from 1998).\n\nSexually themed art should be distinguished from sexually\nstimulating art, i.e., art that stimulates its target audience\nsexually, even though it may not have had the aim to do so. While some\nmay find it difficult to think of any examples in this category,\nSircello argues on phenomenological grounds that everything that is\ntruly beautiful, and hence every work of art that is truly beautiful,\nwill be experienced as sexually titillating. For instance, when he\nstudies The Burghers of Calais, with\nits stooped and despondent old men,\n\n\nthe beauty of Rodin\u2019s restless surface leads me \u2026 to rub\nthat glorious bronze, and once again comes that warmth in the\ntesticles, that stirring in the penis, that itch in the nipples and\nthe tongue. (1979: 225)\n\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\nwhen I inspect the austere and meticulous Zurbaran still life, notice\nthe painstaking precision of its details \u2026 (I) feel forthwith\nthose stirrings in the groin. (1979: 225)\n\n\nHowever, while Sircello judges his arousal to be \u201cneither\nabnormal nor idiosyncratic\u201d and to be fully \u201cappropriate\nand natural\u201d (1979: 226) not everyone might agree with that\nassessment.\n\nThe counterpart of sexually stimulating art is failed erotic\nart (or as Levinson 2006 would have it \u201cnominally erotic\nart\u201d): art that aims but does not succeed in stimulating its\ntarget audience sexually (see also Mag Uidhir 2010). Anti-erotic\nart, on the other hand, is art that aims to induce\nnegative sexual feelings, thoughts, and imaginings in its\ntarget audience. Otto Dix\u2019s Old\nCouple (1923) or George Grosz\u2019s\nSex Murder in the Ackerstrasse (1916\u20137) could\nserve as illustrations. More recently, feminist artists such as Kiki\nSmith have explored the dark, violent, abject aspects of sexuality in\ntheir work (see, for instance, Smith\u2019s\nTale, 1992, and Blood Pool,\n1992).\n\nFinally, because censorship and moral policing have often prevented\nartists from making work that is openly erotic, it is worth drawing\nattention to the existence of covertly erotic art, that is,\nart made with the covert intention to stimulate its target\naudience sexually and that succeeds to some extent in doing so. A good\nexample are the so called \u201csukashi shunga\u201d (hidden shunga)\nthat were popular in Japan at the beginning of the 20th\ncentury. Shunga are woodblock prints, often created by Japan\u2019s\nleading artists, depicting highly erotic scenes. While there were\nalready regulations in the early 18th century against the\ndistribution of shunga, it was only at the end of the 19th\ncentury, in the wake of Japan\u2019s increasing openness towards the\nWest, that censorship laws were really being enforced. As a result,\nhidden (see-through) shunga prints were designed to escape the strict\neye of the censor. What at first sight appear to be beautifully drawn\npostcards depicting landscapes with some space in the middle and at\nthe corners to write one\u2019s message, when held up to the light,\nturn out to be sexually explicit lovemaking scenes (Aki 2013: 47). An\nexample of an entirely different kind might be Maria Scanu\u2019s\nsculpture of Madonna del Naviganti (1999) or Vermeer\u2019s\nMilk Maid (1657\u201358).\nGiven that milk maids had a reputation for sexual availability in 17th\ncentury Holland, some scholars have argued that the painting has a\ncovert erotic message, with the foot warmer on the floor suggesting\nfeminine desire (because foot warmers would heat not only the feet but\neverything under a woman\u2019s skirt) and one of the Delft tiles in\nthe scene depicting Cupid, while another tile shows a traveling man\npossibly suggesting that the maid is thinking of an absent lover\n(Liedtke 2009).\n2. Modern Aesthetics and the Problem of Erotic Art \n\nAre there \u00fcberhaupt any works of erotic art? This may\nseem a silly question, especially to anyone who is familiar with art\nhistory and with the well-established tradition of erotic art in\nparticular. But to students of modern aesthetics, that is, the\nphilosophy of art and beauty from roughly the beginning of the\n18th century to the end of the 19th century,\nthat question will not appear absurd at all.\n2.1 The Aesthetic Disenfranchisement of the Erotic\n\nModern aesthetics famously built a wall between aesthetic pleasure, on\nthe one hand, and sensual or sexual pleasures, on the other hand,\nleaving precious little room for works that aim to combine the two.\nThe problem becomes clear when we consider Immanuel Kant\u2019s\nCritique of Judgment (1790), arguably the most central and\ninfluential work of that period. According to Kant, a pure aesthetic\njudgment is based entirely on a feeling of disinterested pleasure,\ni.e., a pleasure that does not depend on or generate a desire for the\nobject. But since works of erotic art are meant precisely to tap into\nand stimulate our sexual appetites and desires, it is hard to see how\nthey can be the object of an aesthetic judgment. They are rather\nprimed to be the object of what Kant calls a judgment of the\nagreeable, based on an \u201cinterested pleasure\u201d, in this case\nthe titillation provided by the alluring depictions of attractive\nbodies and seductive poses. The sensual pleasure offered by such\nrepresentations is very different from the enjoyment that occurs in an\naesthetic experience and which results from the free play of the\ncognitive faculties of imagination and understanding. According to\nKant, it is because aesthetic judgments are grounded not in any\ninterest, but rather in the subjective conditions of cognition, which\nare shared by all rational beings, that they can lay claim to\nuniversality. The pleasure solicited by erotic art can obviously not\nlay claim to such universality since it will depend on one\u2019s\nsexual preferences and inclinations.\n\nKant was not the first to introduce disinterestedness as hallmark of\nthe aesthetic and isolate it as such from what is merely sensually or\nsexually appealing. Anthony Ashley Cooper, the third Earl of\nShaftesbury, is often credited with this insight. In his\nCharacteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times (1711)\nShaftesbury already stated that the response solicited by beauty is\none of rational and refined contemplation, far removed from the crude\npleasures that we receive through our senses.\n\nA problem that immediately arises for Shaftesbury\u2019s account is\nthe one posed by the \u201cdazzling form\u201d of a beautiful woman\n(1964 [1711]: 136). Here, beauty and sensual appeal, far from being\nantithetical, actually seem to go hand in hand. Still, Shaftesbury\ninsists that the two kinds of pleasure are utterly distinct, even\nthough, in this particular case, erotic pleasure may indeed follow in\nthe wake of aesthetic pleasure. One could make a comparison, he\nwrites, with someone who goes from contemplating the beauty of a tree\nto fantasizing about its tasty fruits. Both activities are\npleasurable, but the pleasures involved are very different: one is a\ndisinterested aesthetic pleasure, the other is a pleasure informed by\nour self-interest. It points to a sensual joy, based on an appetite\nthat we have in common with animals, or \u201cbrutes\u201d as\nShaftesbury prefers to call them. The contemplation of beauty, by\ncontrast, is unique to us rational beings. That\u2019s because beauty\nis exclusively an object of the mind.\n\nBut can one really draw the distinction in such absolute terms? When\nwe admire an attractive man or woman, isn\u2019t it precisely their\nbeauty that activates the senses and gives rise to certain\nbodily passions? And if so, doesn\u2019t this prove that the two are\nintimately linked? Shaftesbury dismisses this line of thought almost\nout of hand. After all, we wouldn\u2019t say that it is the\nbeauty of the fruit that attracts and brings joy to the\nprowling animal in search of food; or that it is the beauty of the\nfood served at the dinner table that makes us humans hungry. What\nwhets and satisfies appetite of both humans and animals is not the\nstriking form, but what lies beneath that striking form, that which is\nmere matter. (Accordingly, the more a mouthwatering dish or body is\nviewed, the further they are from satisfying by mere view.) Just as it\nis not the material that makes a sculpture beautiful, but rather the\nartistic intentions and designs that shape the material, so it is not\nthe body in itself, something that is mere matter, that is\nbeautiful:\n\n\nWhat is it you admire but mind, or the effect of mind? Tis mind alone\nwhich forms. All which is void of mind is horrid, and matter formless\nis deformity itself. (1964 [1711]: 132)\n\n\nMind is the only true object of beauty. Moreover, it is only\nthrough the mind that beauty can be apprehended and\nappreciated, for if animals can\u2019t know and enjoy beauty\nprecisely because they have only senses, it follows that man\ncan\u2019t conceive or enjoy beauty through his senses (the\n\u201cbrutish part\u201d).\n\nIt is evident that, for Shaftesbury, erotic art, which is all about\npresenting desirable bodies and stirring up sensual pleasures, can\nhave no legitimate place within the realm of the aesthetic. Yet, apart\nfrom a brief passage in which he denounces the \u201cself-improving\nartist\u201d who makes a fortune by \u201cstudying bodies\u201d\n(1964 [1711]: 144), Shaftesbury does not explicitly criticize or\nattack any kind of art or artist. (Like Kant, his primary focus is not\nart, but beauty.) Someone who does explicitly take up such a critical\nstance, however, is Arthur Schopenhauer. If Shaftesbury is the\nphilosopher who inspired Kant to develop the theory of\ndisinterestedness, then Schopenhauer is the philosopher who, inspired\nby Kant, has taken this notion of disinterestedness and worked it up\ninto a fully-fledged philosophy of art.\n\nThis is not the place to discuss all the minutiae of\nSchopenhauer\u2019s The World as Will and Representation\n(1818). Crucial, for our purposes, is his concept of \u201cdas\nReizende\u201d, which will here be translated as \u201cthe\nstimulating.\u201d The stimulating is \u201cthat which excites the\nwill by directly presenting to it satisfaction, fulfillment\u201d\n(Schopenhauer 1969 [1818]: 207). It ought to be shunned at all price\nin art, says Schopenhauer, because it\n\n\ndraws the beholder down from pure contemplation, demanded by every\napprehension of the beautiful, since it necessarily stirs his will by\nobjects that directly appeal to it. Thus the beholder no longer\nremains pure subject of knowing, but becomes the needy and dependent\nsubject of willing. (Schopenhauer 1969 [1818]: 207)\n\n\nThis is contrary to the aim of art, which is to facilitate will-less\ncontemplation of the Ideas.\n\nSchopenhauer is quite specific about what the stimulating consists\nin:\n\n\nIn historical painting and in sculpture (it) consists in nude figures,\nthe position, semi-drapery, and whole treatment of which are\ncalculated to excite lustful feeling in the beholder. (1969 [1818]:\n207\u20138)\n\n\nIt is important to note that he does not object to depicting the nude\nfigure as such\u2014after all, \u201cthe ancients\u201d did so\n\u201calmost always free from \u2026 fault\u201d (ibid.).\nWhat he objects to is a particular treatment of the nude, one\nwhich is designed to excite lustful feelings in the beholder. In other\nwords, what he targets and denounces is erotic art. Like Shaftesbury\nand Kant he is drawn to make a comparison with food. Fruit is\nadmissible as a subject matter for paintings\n\n\nfor it exhibits itself as a further development of the flower, and as\na beautiful product of nature through form and colour, without our\nbeing positively forced to think of its edibility. (ibid.:\n207\u20138)\n\n\nBut what is not admissible are prepared and served-up dishes, depicted\nwith a high degree of realism. Dutch still life paintings depicting\noysters, herrings, crabs, bread, butter, beer, wine, excite the\nappetite and are objectionable for the exact same reasons as erotic\npaintings and sculptures, which excite sexual appetite, are\nobjectionable: they stimulate the will and as such put an end to any\naesthetic contemplation of the object. Given that the function of art\nis to facilitate aesthetic experience, it follows for Schopenhauer\nthat \u201cthe stimulating \u2026 is everywhere to be avoided in\nart\u201d (ibid: 208; see also Neill 2012).\n2.2 The Legacy of Modern Aesthetics\n\nModern aesthetics has cast a long shadow into the 20th and\neven the 21st century, and the idea that the aesthetic and\nthe erotic are fundamentally incompatible has proved to be very\ninfluential throughout.\n\nClive Bell, the great champion of aesthetic formalism, inscribes\nhimself neatly in that tradition. In his landmark book, Art\n(1914), he begins by drawing a sharp contrast between the aesthetic\nemotion, which is provoked by works of art in virtue of a certain\npleasing combination of lines and colors, and sexual feelings and\ndesires which are provoked by sensually appealing bodies. The two\ncould not be more different, he thinks:\n\n\nlet no one imagine, because he has made merry in the warm tilth and\nquaint nooks of romance, that he can even guess at the austere and\nthrilling raptures of those who have climbed the cold, white peaks of\nart. (1961 [1914]: 42)\n\n\nNevertheless, Bell acknowledges, as did Shaftesbury, that the two\nemotions are often confused partly because in everyday speech the word\n\u201cbeauty\u201d is used indiscriminately for items that fall in\neach of the two categories (beautiful works of art, attractive men and\nwomen). To prevent any further confusion, he insists therefore on\nusing the word \u201csignificant form,\u201d instead of beauty, for\nthe combination of lines and colors that produces the aesthetic\nemotion. (Shaftesbury, one will recall, was revisionist in the\nopposite direction, refusing to employ the word beauty for that which\nis merely desirable.)\n\nWhat about those works of art that appeal to our sensual feelings and\ndesires and that are so popular with the man in the street?\n\n\nThe art that they call \u201cbeautiful\u201d is generally closely\nrelated to the women. A beautiful picture is a photograph of a pretty\ngirl; beautiful music, the music that provokes emotions similar to\nthose provoked by young ladies in musical farces; and beautiful\npoetry, the poetry that recalls the same emotions felt, twenty years\nearlier, for the rector\u2019s daughter. (1961 [1914]:\n28\u201329)\n\n\nBell has no patience with ignorant folks who seek out pictures, poems,\nor music for these reasons. They are simply confusing the sensual and\nthe aesthetic. Of course, this does not mean that paintings depicting\npretty girls cannot be art. They can, but if they are art, they will\nbe so despite their erotic content. For example, when Manet\u2019s\nOlympia, a picture of a\nprostitute, caused a storm of indignation in Paris of the 1860s, Emile\nZola defended the painting in terms that Bell would have approved\nof:\n\n\nTell them aloud, dear master, that you are not what they think you\nare, that a painting is for you a mere pretext for analysis. You\nneeded \u2026 clear and luminous tones, and you introduced a\nbouquet; you needed black tones and you placed in a corner a Negress\nand a cat. (Zola 1991: 161)\n\n\nFor Bell and his fellow formalists, significant form is the only\nimportant artistic criterion. Where it comes to insulating the\naesthetic from the erotic, many prominent philosophers in the\n20th century have followed in Bell\u2019s footsteps, even\nwhen they do not subscribe to his formalism. In The Principles of\nArt (1938), R. G. Collingwood observes how \u201cthe words\n\u2018beauty\u2019, \u2018beautiful\u2019, as actually used, have\nno aesthetic implication\u201d since they often indicate \u201cthe\nsatisfaction of some desire or the arousing of some emotion\u201d\n(1938: 38\u201341). For Collingwood, a beautiful man or woman\nordinarily means one whom we find sexually desirable. And he firmly\nstates that this \u201chas nothing whatever to do with aesthetic\nexperience. It has to do with that other kind of experience that Plato\ncalled eros\u201d (1938: 41). Similarly, Monroe Beardsley\ninsisted on a strict divide between the two sorts of responses and\nrevised his theory of aesthetic experience when it was pointed out to\nhim that it did not exclude sexual experiences from the realm of the\naesthetic (Beardsley 1982). Edward Bullough famously posited\n\u201cpsychical distance\u201d as a prerequisite for experiencing\nart and concluded that\n\n\nexplicit references to organic affections, \u2026 especially to\nsexual matters, lie normally below the Distance-limit, and can be\ntouched on by Art only with special precautions. (1969: 403)\n\n\nEven in the 21st century one will find philosophers who are\ndeeply sceptical about the aesthetic and artistic potential of the\nerotic. Mohan Matthen, for instance, states that \u201cerotic art\ntends not to be great art\u201d because\n\n\neven when erotica are artistic \u2026 they have too direct an effect\non sexual response, and this distracts the viewer\u2019s attention\naway from the work itself. (2011: 354)\n\n\nThe more erotic a work of art, the more difficult it is to appreciate\naesthetically. Matthen makes this claim in an essay review of The\nArt Instinct (2009), a book on evolutionary aesthetics written by\nDenis Dutton, who also claims that eroticism is best avoided in art,\nthough for different reasons than Matthen. While the latter considers\nthe sexual response too distracting, Dutton argues that it is rather\ntoo crude and too basic to count as a proper aesthetic response. A\nhigh degree of meaning-complexity is the hallmark of all great art,\naccording to Dutton, but while love is complex, \u201c(s)ex itself is\njust too simple\u201d (2009: 238). As a consequence,\n\n\nlove is the most pervasive theme for representative arts everywhere,\n(whereas) explicit eroticism does not tend to figure importantly in\nthe greatest masterpieces. (2009: 238)\n\n\nJust like a bowl of corn syrup and a plate of sugar will never be\ndinner, Dutton flippantly observes, erotic paintings, novels, and\npoems will never qualify as art of the highest order. (It is certainly\nnoteworthy that Dutton, who is the antipode of modern aesthetics in\ndoing away with the very notion of a disinterested pleasure and\nassuming that matters of sexual reproduction are vital in explaining\nour interest in art and aesthetics, actually finds himself in the\ncompany of Schopenhauer, Kant, and Shaftesbury where erotic art is\nconcerned.)\n\nTo recapitulate: if (disinterested, contemplative) aesthetic responses\nare indeed irreconcilable with (interested, bodily) sexual responses,\nas so many philosophers of art in the past have thought, then there\nhardly remains any conceptual space for works that aim for both kinds\nof response. Yet, we do, as a matter of fact, have this longstanding\ntradition of erotic art, not just in the West but also in many\nnon-Western cultures. How to account for this?\n\nProponents of modern aesthetics could simply bite the bullet here and\nargue, as Mohan Matthen does, that erotic art tends not to be great\nart, or, following Bell, that erotic paintings, books, poems can only\nattain art status despite their erotic content. But that is a big\nbullet to bite, by any standard. Not only are there so many\noutstanding works of erotic art, but the eroticism of these works is\nalso more often than not an integral part of their status and value as\nart. To be sure, there are nude paintings and sculptures which seem to\nqualify first and foremost as studies in formal beauty (certain\nsculptures of Henry Moore come to mind). But anyone who would regard,\nsay, The Naked Maja by Goya (c.\n1797\u20131800) or Les D\u00e9lassements\nd\u2019Eros by Gerda Wegener (1925) as a mere formal exercise\nwould entirely misunderstand and fail to appreciate what these works\nare about. That is why the great majority of aestheticians today\nprefer the other horn of the dilemma. Instead of denying the existence\nof genuinely erotic art, they will deny that aesthetic and erotic\nresponses are antithetical and hence reject the basic tenets of modern\naesthetics.\n2.3 The Aesthetic Rehabilitation of the Erotic\n\nModern aesthetics and its 20th century formalist and\nexperientialist heirs have been criticized from many sides. But\ninstead of offering a general critique, let us consider briefly some\nof the philosophers who, in attacking modern aesthetics, have\nexplicitly pleaded for the inclusion of the sexual within the domain\nof aesthetics.\n\nOne of the most vehement early critics was Friedrich Nietzsche. In an\noft-quoted passage in On the Genealogy of Morals (1887:\nIII.6) Nietzsche shifts attention to the artist\u2019s point of view\nto reveal a fundamental flaw in modern aesthetics:\n\n\nWhen our aestheticians tirelessly rehearse, in support of Kant\u2019s\nview, that the spell of beauty enables us to view even nude female\nstatues \u201cdisinterestedly\u201d we may be allowed to laugh a\nlittle at their expense. The experiences of artists in this delicate\nmatter are rather more \u201cinteresting\u201d; certainly Pygmalion\nwas not entirely devoid of aesthetic feeling.\n\n\n(NB: For Nietzsche\u2019s texts we have relied on the classic edition\nof Colli & Montinari, 1967\u201378. On the Genealogy of\nMorals is abbreviated as GM, The Will to Power is\nabbreviated as WP, and Twilight of the Idols is abbreviated\nas TI. The translations we have used are listed in the\nbibliography)\n\nPygmalion fell under the spell of the beautiful statue he had created,\nbut his enjoyment was certainly not bereft of any desire. For\nNietzsche, the case of Pygmalion is not exceptional, but rather\nemblematic: \u201cAll art works tonically, increases strength,\ninflames desire\u201d (WP \u00a7809). And, as he writes in\nTwilight of the Idols (1889),\n\n\nall beauty incites to procreation\u2014\u2026 precisely this is the\nproprium of its effect, from the most sensual regions up into\nthe most spiritual\u2026. (TI IX.22)\n\n\nTo believe, as Schopenhauer, Kant, Shaftesbury seem to have done, that\nin matters of beauty and art there is such a thing as\n\u201cimmaculate perception\u201d (an aesthetic regard pure of any\ndesire), is simply to deceive oneself.\n\nFar from building a wall between the aesthetic and the sexual,\nNietzsche sees them as intimately linked: \u201cThe demand for art\nand beauty is an indirect demand for the ecstasies of sexuality\u201d\n(WP \u00a7805). The two experiences really share the same structure\nand phenomenology. As with sexual experience, if there is to be\n\u201cany aesthetic doing or seeing, one physiological condition is\nindispensable: rapture\u201d (TI IX, 8). And the pleasure that one\nreceives is not a disembodied, cognitive pleasure\u2014a unique kind\nof experience that would set us apart from animals. No,\n\n\nart reminds (us) of states of animal vigour: it is on the one hand an\nexcess and overflow of blooming corporeality into the world\nof images and desires: on the other, an excitation of the animal\nfunctions through the images and desires of intensified life. (WP\n\u00a7802)\n\n\nThus, while the erotic masterpieces of the past must qualify as\nregrettable anomalies for someone like Schopenhauer, Nietzsche has no\ntrouble at all in giving them a place.\n\nWithin contemporary aesthetics, Alexander Nehamas and Richard\nShusterman have made a serious and sustained effort to make room for\nthe erotic within aesthetics and art. In the first few pages of his\nbook Only a Promise of Happiness (2007), Nehamas lays his\ncards on the table. Mentioning Kant and Schopenhauer as his\nadversaries, he states uncompromisingly that \u201cthe only reaction\nappropriate to beauty is eros\u2014love, the desire to\npossess it\u201d (2007: 6). While eros should not\nnecessarily be understood in a sexual sense here, Nehamas does think\nthat erotic encounters provide an instructive model for aesthetic\nexperiences in general:\n\n\nThe most abstract and intellectual beauty provokes the urge to possess\nit no less than the most sensual inspires the passion to come to know\nit better. (2007: 7)\n\n\nEach judgment of beauty is future oriented, is identical with the\nspark of desire, and contains, in the words of Stendhal, a promise of\nhappiness (Stendhal 1926: 74; Nehamas 2007: 55).\n\nFor Nehamas, too, erotic art is not at all a recalcitrant exception in\nneed of explanation. Quite the contrary, it offers the best possible\ninroad to understanding what beauty and art are all about. It\u2019s\nnot a coincidence that the touchstone work of art, to which Nehamas\nreturns again and again, is Manet\u2019s Olympia. Far from\nbeing an exercise in formal beauty, as Zola would have it, this is a\npainting that is precisely designed\n\n\nto jolt the audience, especially the men, into acknowledging that what\nthey were enjoying was not a painted canvas or an idealized figure\nwith an edifying message but a naked woman of their own place and\ntime. (Nehamas 2007: 27)\n\n\nIt is erotic in every sense of the word and for Nehamas it does what\nall great art should do: spark the audience\u2019s desire.\n\nIf Nehamas mainly takes issue with the disavowal of desire within\nmodern aesthetics, Richard Shusterman\u2019s main target is the\n\u201cidealist-rationalist repugnance for the body\u201d which he\nfinds is permeating the entire tradition of Western philosophy (2005:\n324; see also Irvin (ed.) 2016). To counter this, Shusterman proposes\na new discipline, \u201csomaesthetics,\u201d which aims to study the\n\u201cexperience and use of one\u2019s body as a locus of\nsensory-aesthetic appreciation and creative self-fashioning\u201d\n(1999: 302) and which has as one of its main subsidiary ambitions to\n\u201c(i)mprove our appreciation of the artistry, beauty, meaning\nthat sexual experience can offer\u201d (2008: 85). In several of his\nessays he argues that sexual experience itself can qualify as an\naesthetic experience, since most of the crucial features attributed to\naesthetic experiences are also attributable to erotic experiences:\nthey are pursued and valued for their own sake, they are rich in\nintensity and stand out distinctively from the flow of ordinary\nhumdrum experience, they display harmonies of structure and developing\nform, they are being subjectively savored but also intentionally\ndirected at an object, they deeply engage thought, feeling, and\nimagination, and stimulate both body and mind (2007: 57, 2008: 93).\nHence, instead of ignoring or disenfranchising the tradition of erotic\nart, Shusterman pleads for the reassertion of an \u201cars\nerotica\u201d which would not just involve a renewed attention for\ncertain works of the past, but would entail the development of genuine\nerotic art forms that could help increase our understanding of the\nrelation between aesthetics and sex, deliver aesthetically rewarding\nerotic experiences, and deepen our appreciation of the aesthetic\npotential of other somatic practices (2007: 57; 2021).\n3. Contemporary Aesthetics and the Problem of Pornographic Art\n\nWhile not everyone will take the aesthetic recuperation of the erotic\nas far as Shusterman and Nehamas, very few philosophers today will\ndeny the existence and aesthetic legitimacy of erotic art. So, does\nthis mean that the wall between the sexual and the aesthetic has been\ntorn down? Not entirely. It seems more accurate to say that the battle\nlines have been redrawn. The suspicion towards the erotic may have\nlargely subsided in contemporary aesthetics, but it has been replaced\nby a very pronounced scepticism of the pornographic. Many philosophers\nof art, including Roger Scruton, Jerrold Levinson, and Christy Mag\nUidhir, deny that there is (or can be) such a thing as pornographic\nart. In other words, they advocate a strict divide between erotic art\nand pornography. Some of their scepticism, one cannot fail to notice,\nbears a significant resemblance to the earlier resistance against\nerotic art.\n\nPornographic representations are sexually explicit and rich in\nanatomical detail, Scruton points out, whereas works of erotic art\nrely on suggestion and, instead of focusing on certain body parts,\nwill try to capture the individuality, personality, and subjectivity\nof the represented person. In Titian\u2019s\nVenus of Urbino (1538), for instance, it is not the\nsexual organs but the face, as \u201cwindow to the soul,\u201d that\nprovides the focus of attention (1986: 154, 2005: 11, 2009: 149). A\npornographic image, by contrast, \u201cis like a magic wand that\nturns subjects into objects, people into things\u2014and thereby\ndisenchants them, destroying the source of their beauty\u201d (2009:\n163). As part of his project to rehabilitate beauty as the central\naesthetic and artistic category, Scruton also appeals to the\ndistinction between \u201cthe nude\u201d and \u201cthe naked\u201d\nmade famous by Kenneth Clark (1956). The artistic nude constitutes, as\nthe subtitle of Clark\u2019s book indicates, a \u201cStudy in Ideal\nForm\u201d: the body is beautifully shaped and framed by the\nconventions of art. The people in pornographic images are not nude,\nbut naked. They are deprived of clothes, and as such exposed in an\nembarrassing way. Furthermore, while the Titian nude retains a\ndetached serenity, pornography arouses the viewer, which is always\n\u201can aesthetic defect, a \u2018fall\u2019 into another kind of\ninterest than that which has beauty as its target\u201d (2009:\n160).\n\nLevinson also wishes to separate erotic art from pornography in terms\nof the kind of response they call for, yet his argument is markedly\ndifferent from Scruton\u2019s. Here\u2019s a summary of\nLevinson\u2019s argument:\n\nErotic art consists of images centrally aimed at a certain sort of\nreception (R1).\nPornography consists of images centrally aimed at a certain sort\nof reception (R2).\nR1 essentially involves attention to form/vehicle/medium/manner,\nand so entails treating images as in part opaque.\nR2 essentially excludes attention to form/vehicle/medium/manner,\nand so entails treating images as wholly transparent.\nR1 and R2 are incompatible.\nHence, nothing can be both erotic art and pornography; or at the\nleast, nothing can be coherently projected as both erotic art and\npornography; or at the very least, nothing can succeed as erotic art\nand pornography at the same time. (2005: 239)\n\n\nElsewhere in the article Levinson makes it clear that by\n\u201cR1\u201d he means aesthetic delight or aesthetic experience\nand that \u201cR2\u201d refers to sexual arousal and release:\n\n\nthe aims of true pornography and the aims of art, erotic art included,\nare not compatible, but war against one another (\u2026). One\ninduces you, in the name of arousal and release, to ignore the\nrepresentation so as to get at the represented, the other induces you,\nin the name of aesthetic delight, to dwell on the representation.\n(2005: 234)\n\n\nThis has been the single most influential argument in recent debates\non the relation between erotic art and pornography, winning many\nsupporters (Matthen 2011; Nanay 2012; Neill 2012) but also attracting\na substantial amount of criticism (see, for instance, Kania 2012;\nDavies 2012; van Brabandt and Prinz 2012; Patridge 2013). While one\nmay want to challenge some of Levinson\u2019s premises (as Maes 2009\ndoes in a systematic way), one could also question whether his rather\nradical conclusion really follows from said premises. After all, it\nseems that one can (coherently and successfully) aim at\nincompatible audience responses, as long as one does not expect these\nresponses to be elicited at the same time, in the same audience (see\nMaes 2011).\n\nAs opposed to key representatives of modern aesthetics, both Levinson\nand Scruton have no problem acknowledging the existence of erotic art.\nHowever, they do object very strongly to the possibility of there\nbeing pornographic art, and it\u2019s not hard to discern in their\nrespective objections\u2014which rely on notions such as beauty,\ncontemplation, ideal form, aesthetic experience\u2014the remnants and\nresidual influence of modern aesthetics. This is less obvious in\nChristy Mag Uidhir\u2019s attempt to draw a line between pornography\nand art. While Scruton insists on the controversial connection between\nart and beauty, and Levinson builds his case on the idea that a work\nof art\u2019s main purpose is to produce an aesthetic experience and\ndraw attention to its own formal features, Mag Uidhir\u2019s argument\ndoes not rely on any such substantial claims. He does not even claim\nthat art has or should have a purpose. Mag Uidhir asks us only to\naccept that if a work of art has a purpose, including perhaps\nthe purpose of sexual titillation as is the case in erotic art, then\nthat purpose must be manner specific. Here\u2019s how he arrives at\nhis exclusivist position (2009: 194):\n\nIf something is pornography, then that something has the purpose\nof sexual arousal (of some audience).\nIf something is pornography, then that something has the purpose\nof sexual arousal and that purpose is manner inspecific.\nIf something is art, then if that something has a purpose, then\nthat purpose is manner specific.\nIf something is art, then if that something has the purpose of\nsexual arousal, then that purpose is manner specific.\nA purpose cannot be both manner specific and manner\ninspecific.\nTherefore, if something is pornography, then it is not art.\n\n\nFor a purpose to be manner specific, according to Mag Uidhir, is for\nit to be essentially constituted both by an action (or state of\naffairs) and a manner, such that the purpose is to perform that action\n(or bring about that state of affairs) in that particular manner. A\npurpose is manner inspecific, on the other hand, if failure to perform\nthe action (or bring about the state of affairs) in the prescribed\nmanner does not necessarily constitute failure to satisfy the\npurpose.\n\nMag Uidhir\u2019s approach is markedly different from Scruton\u2019s\nand Levinson\u2019s. Still, regarding the central issue, he aligns\nhimself squarely with other sceptics. He, too, thinks that artists or\npornographers attempting to produce something that is both (erotic)\nart and pornography, in fact attempt the impossible. However, recent\ncritics of Mag Uidhir have raised doubts about his second premise\n(Davies 2012; Patridge 2013), as well as the general validity of his\nargument (Maes 2012). These critics belong to a growing number of\nphilosophers who find exclusivists\u2019 arguments unconvincing and\nargue for the existence of pornographic art as a subclass of erotic\nart (Kieran 2001, van Brabandt and Prinz 2012, Fokt 2012).\n4. Erotic Art vs Pornography: Beyond Aesthetics\n\nBesides aesthetics, there are at least two other areas of academic\nstudy where the distinction between erotic art and pornography has\nbeen at the centre of serious philosophical debate: feminist theory\nand art history.\n4.1 Erotic Art, Art History, and the Cultural History of Pornography\n\nArt historians who write about erotic art are often quite anxious to\ndraw a strict dividing line between \u201chigh brow\u201d erotic art\nand \u201clow brow\u201d pornography. Kenneth Clark, mentioned\nearlier, famously stated to the Longford Committee Investigating\nPornography:\n\n\nTo my mind art exists in the realm of contemplation \u2026 the\nmoment art becomes an incentive to action it loses its true character.\n(Longford 1972: 280)\n\n\nThis was his main objection to pornography: that it was in essence an\nincentive to sexual acts. However, as a justification for the radical\nseparation of art and pornography this will not do. For one thing,\nClark seems to overlook the fact that there are numerous religious or\npolitically inspired masterpieces that call on people to change their\nlives or perform certain actions (the Isenheim\nAltarpiece, 1512\u201316, or Delacroix\u2019s\nLiberty Leading the People,\n1830, come to mind).\n\nThis brings us to another rationale for separating erotic art and\npornography that is very popular among art historians (and is somewhat\nreminiscent of Dutton\u2019s expressed reservations towards eroticism\nin art). Art is necessarily multi-layered, it is argued, whereas\npornography is one-dimensional; it has only one job to do and\ntherefore lacks the formal and structural intricacy, the cognitive\ncomplexity, and interpretive openness of art (see, for example, Webb\n1975: 6; Mahon 2005: 14; Wallace et al. 2007: 15). But while the\nIsenheim Altarpiece and Liberty Leading the People\nmay indeed be very complex works, there is good reason to believe that\nthe insistence on the simplicity of pornography is itself the result\nof an oversimplification. Let us examine this claim in more\ndetail.\n\n(1) A simple purpose? It is tempting to think of pornography\nas having only one, very rudimentary purpose: sexual arousal of the\naudience. But a look at very early pornographic works, those that were\nproduced in France and England between 1500 and 1800, shows how\nmisleading that conception is. Almost all pornographic works of that\nera deliberately used the shock of sex to criticize religious and\npolitical authorities (Hunt 1996: 35). With their truth-telling trope\nthey were meant to function as a powerful antidote to the many forms\nof repression in society and often had the explicit aim to educate\npeople about politics, religion, society, and of course, sex (Lubey\n2022). It is not a coincidence that these books were known in 18th\ncentury France as \u201clivres philosophiques\u201d (they were\nconsidered just as dangerous to society as philosophical treatises)\nand that the rise in pornography around 1740 coincided with the\nhey-day of the Enlightenment (Hunt 1996; Darnton 1995). Quite a few of\nthe pornographic novels of that time even carried the term\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d in the title (think of Sade\u2019s\nLa Philosophie dans le Boudoir,\n1795) and some of them were actually written by prominent\nphilosophers who were keen to use this extremely popular genre to\ndivulge some of their ideas to the masses (think of Diderot\u2019s\nLes Bijoux Indiscrets,\n1748).\n\nIn one of the most notorious examples of the genre, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\nPhilosophe (1748),\nwritten by the philosopher Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis\nd\u2019Argens, a great variety of copulations is used to communicate\nwhat is in essence a materialist and mechanistic metaphysics. In\nanonymous bedrooms, bodies brought together by individual need and\ninterest collide just like the atoms of the natural philosophers\n(Jacob 1996: 160). And the bodies themselves are described as machines\npowered by the relentless motion inherent in matter, by passions they\ncannot control:\n\n\nThe arrangement of our organs, the disposition of our fibers, a\ncertain movement of our fluids, all determine the type of passions\nwhich work upon us, directing our reason and our will in the smallest\nas well as the greatest actions we perform. (Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\nPhilosophe, excerpted in Darnton 1995: 100)\n\n\nOr, as the main character herself observes:\n\n\nMen and women couple like machines. Love for them is a tingling in the\nepidermis, a surge of liquids, a rush of particles through the fibers,\nand nothing more. (Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Philosophe,\nexcerpted in Leemans 2002: 257)\n\n\n(2) Formal and structural simplicity? Pornography of the\nenlightenment era also serves to tackle another misconception. It has\nbeen argued that, because the main aim of pornographers is to sexually\narouse the audience, they are forced to include as many sexually\nexplicit scenes as possible, leaving precious little room for plot\ndevelopment or formal intricacies (Steiner 1975). The pornographer\n\u201cconcocts no better than a crude excuse for a beginning; and\nonce having begun, it goes on and on and ends nowhere\u201d (Sontag\n1994: 39). Pornography, as Adorno already noted, lacks the\nbeginning-middle-end form characteristic of literature (Sontag 1994:\n39). Yet, again, this gives us far from a waterproof criterion for\ndistinguishing erotic literature from pornography. For instance, the\nstructural complexity of the pornographic novel, Histoire\nde Dom B\u2026 Portier des Chartreux\n(1741), with its embedded stories and variety of narrators, has\noften been noted by scholars (Frappier-Mazur 1996: 211). The careful\ncomposition of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, where the author has\narranged the parts to maximize the refraction, so that wherever the\nreader turns he seems to see throbbing sexuality, provides another\ncounterexample (Darnton 1995).\n\n(3) One-dimensional in its effect on the audience? It could\nbe thought that sexual arousal is such a powerful, bodily state that\nit must block out all other functions, most notably our cognitive\nfaculties. Levinson claims that this is precisely what distinguishes\nsexual arousal from sexual stimulation, which he thinks is\nnot incompatible with the cognitive activity required for\naesthetic appreciation (2005: 232). Other philosophers have challenged\nthis controversial distinction (Blackburn 2006: 52; Maes 2012).\nMoreover, even if one were to accept the animal-like nature of sexual\narousal, that does not mean that it cannot be cognitively rewarding\nand artistically appropriate. As one commentator of Cleland\u2019s\nFanny Hill notes:\n\n\nThe stimulus of reading a scene in Fanny Hill makes in the\nreader\u2019s own nature the point made in the text. The reader may\nbe moved to reconsider the merits of stoicism, revaluate the powers of\nthe mind to control the body, reread his Descartes and think again of\nthe dividing line between mind and the b\u00eate-machine. (Braudy\n1991: 85)\n\n\n(4) Simple to interpret? While questions of interpretation\narise frequently in relation to works of erotic art, people rarely\nseem to have interpretive qualms where pornography is concerned.\nIndeed, if an interpretation typically attempts to account for those\nelements in a work whose presence is not immediately obvious to the\ntarget audience (Carroll 2009), there may seem no need for an\ninterpretation in the case of pornography since it is all too obvious\nwhy such films or novels include one sexually explicit scene after\nanother. Still, here too it is important not to jump to conclusions.\nThere are (at least) two different kinds of interpretative projects\none could engage in, each with its own set of lead questions.\n\u201cWhat is the work about?\u201d is one question one could ask.\nAnother question is \u201cWhat does the work reveal about the author\nor the time, place, culture, society in which it was made?\u201d\nWhile the former is central to the discipline of art criticism, the\nlatter question will usually be the starting point of interpretations\noffered by cultural historians, sociologists, psychoanalysts. These\nlatter interpretations, where pornography is concerned, will be\neverything but simple given the incredible complexity of the\npornographic landscape with its huge catalogue of taboos, body types,\nsex acts, and other things that get people\u2019s blood flowing.\nPornography offers us, in the words of Laura Kipnis, \u201cthe royal\nroad to the cultural psyche\u201d (2006: 118) and as such can prove\nto be a gold mine for interpretations. The other question\u2014What\nis the work about?\u2014seems less pertinent, especially in relation\nto the formulaic and repetitive video clips one finds on porn\nwebsites. Nevertheless, there are other types of pornography where\nissues about meaning and \u201caboutness\u201d do seem highly\nrelevant, such as the philosophical pornography mentioned above and\nthe feminist pornography that will be discussed in the next\nsection.\n\nIn closing, it is worth mentioning a thesis recently put forward by\nEaton (2018), based on art historical considerations regarding the\nfunction of erotic images in 16th-century Italy. Eaton argues that the\nroot of the erotic art/pornography distinction was\u2014at least in\nthat particular context\u2014class. The need for a special category\nof unsanctioned illicit images arose at the very time when print\nculture was beginning to threaten elite privilege. What made an erotic\nrepresentation exceed the boundaries of acceptability, Eaton suggests,\nwas not its extreme libidinosity but, rather, its widespread\navailability and, thereby, its threat to one of the mechanisms of\nsustaining class privilege.\n4.2 Erotic Art, Feminist Theory, and Objectification\n\nIn a short but oft-quoted essay, Gloria Steinem describes what is for\nher \u201ca clear and present difference\u201d:\n\n\nLook at any photo or film of people making love, really making love.\n\u2026 there is usually sensuality and touch and warmth, an\nacceptance of bodies and nerve endings. \u2026 Now look at any\ndepiction of sex in which there is clear force, or an unequal power\nthat spells coercion. \u2026 The first is erotic: a mutually\npleasurable, sexual expression between people who have enough power to\nbe there by positive choice. \u2026 The second is pornographic: its\nmessage is violence, dominance, and conquest. (Steinem 1995: 31)\n\n\nThis idea that there is an important moral difference between\nerotic art and pornography, in so far as pornography focuses on sex\nthat is aggressive, emotionless, or alienated, while the focus of\nerotic art is on love, passion, and equality between partners, has\nbeen very influential (see, for example, Ellis 2006: 30; Mahon 2005:\n15; Ridington 1989: 27). However, delineating the distinctiveness of\nerotic art, as opposed to pornography, in terms of a particular\ncontent will not in and of itself establish that the latter is\nimmoral, while the former is not. As Theodore Gracyk (1987) has\nargued, the morally objectionable character of a representation can\nnever be just a matter of represented subject matter. For an artist\ncan decide to depict rape or other aggressive forms of abuse in an\nattempt to precisely warn and protest against such degradation of\nwomen or men (recall the work of Kiki Smith). That is why Helen\nLongino is careful to define pornography as\n\n\nverbal or pictorial material which represents or describes sexual\nbehavior that is degrading or abusive to one or more of the\nparticipants in such a way as to endorse the degradation.\n(1980: 43, our emphasis)\n\n\nLongino is only one of the many authors who have tried to capture what\nis morally problematic about pornography. But the intricacies of that\ndebate will not concern us here. Our focus is on erotic art, rather\nthan pornography. Still, it is worth considering some of the more\nbasic arguments, because they can be, and have been, put to use in\ndiscussions on the distinction between erotic art and pornography.\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward way to argue that pornography is\nmorally objectionable (in a way that erotic art is not) is to argue\nthat it is harmful. The harm that pornography does may occur in the\nproduction phase, and take the form of coercion, brutality, violence,\nor rape. But even if no harm takes place in the making of pornography,\nand models are treated fairly and with respect, there can still be\npost-production harms. Some have argued that the pornographic\nmaterials themselves constitute harm because, as a form of\nhate speech, they silence and subordinate women (MacKinnon 1987;\nLangton 1993, 2009; Maitra 2009). Others have emphasized that exposure\nto pornographic material may cause harm (Eaton 2007). The\nlatter claim is further refined by specifying the frequency of\nexposure (isolated/cumulative), the nature of the material\n(egalitarian/inegalitarian), the kind of harm inflicted\n(physical/psychological), and whom it is mainly inflicted on\n(consumer/third party). By systematically eroticizing aspects of\ngender inequality, inegalitarian pornography is mainly thought to\ncause harm to a third party, in particular women, through the\npernicious effect it has on its consumers (Eaton 2007).\n\n\u201cExploitation\u201d and \u201cobjectification\u201d are terms\nthat are used particularly often to describe what is wrong with\npornography. Martha Nussbaum (1995), for instance, has written a\nseminal essay on different forms of objectification and how they apply\nto pornography (see also Stock 2015). Artists like Nancy Spero have\ndefined pornography as \u201cstuff that exploits women\u2019s\nbodies\u201d (quoted in Cembalest 1989: 142). It might be thought,\nand indeed Spero and others have argued, that these ethical terms may\nserve to demarcate (erotic) art from pornography\u2014pornography\nbeing exploitative or objectifying in a way that (erotic) art is\nnot.\n\nThis way of drawing the line is significantly problematized by the\nemergence of feminist pornography. Examples are films like Skin.Like.Sun\n(2010, dir. Jennifer Lyon Bell and\nMurielle Scherre) and When We Are Together, We Can Be\nEverywhere (2015, dir. Marit \u00d6stberg), Molly\nKiely\u2019s graphic novel That Kind of\nGirl (1999), or Dirty Diaries,\na collection of Swedish movie shorts (2009). Mutual pleasure\nand consent are absolutely key in these pornographic works which seem\nto exhibit none of the moral flaws manifest in mainstream pornography\n(no exploitation, objectification, or eroticization of gender\ninequality). What is more, in rejecting sexual repression,\nself-oppression, and hypocrisy, these works are often said to have a\npositive, consciousness-raising force (Willis 1995; Taormino et al.\n2013; Maes 2017; 2020; Eaton 2017).\n\nBut even if one were to disregard this rapidly growing subgenre of\npornography, and argue that there is something deeply wrong with\nany type of pornography, that in itself would still not\njustify a strict divide between erotic art and pornography. For every\nplausible account of the relation between moral and artistic\nvalue\u2014whether it is autonomism, ethicism, immoralism, or\ncontextualism\u2014will acknowledge that works of art, including\nworks of erotic art, can be deeply morally flawed (Gaut 2007; see also\nEaton 2003 for an in depth analysis of Titian\u2019s\nRape of Europa, 1562). What\nis more, it appears that whatever (moral) objection one wants to bring\nforward against mainstream pornography, it is likely to apply to some\nerotic art as well (Patridge 2013). First, harm may be inflicted when\nerotic art is being produced (Brown 2002 tells the harrowing story of\nCellini and the Nymph of Fontainebleau). Second, some erotic art may\nalso constitute harm. At least, Langton and MacKinnon\u2019s\narguments seem to carry over seamlessly to (certain strands of) erotic\nart. One of the difficult questions for Langton and MacKinnon\u2014do\npornographers possess the appropriate authority to perform the speech\nacts of silencing and subordinating women?\u2014appears even easier\nto answer in the affirmative in the case of artists since their\nperceived authority is much less contentious. Third, some erotic art\nmay cause harm in the same way as pornography, that is, by eroticizing\naspects of gender inequality and thus shaping people\u2019s sexual\npreferences in such a way that sustains the current inequality between\ngenders (Eaton 2012). Finally, a detailed case is made by,\nrespectively, Cooke 2012 and Eaton 2012 that neither exploitation nor\nobjectification is unique to pornography and that both are present in\nmany works of erotic art\u2014a presence that is frequently\nunacknowledged precisely because critics tend to focus exclusively on\npornography and too often consider art to be above (moral)\ncriticism.\n\nTo conclude, it does not seem possible to make a clear-cut distinction\nbetween erotic art and pornography based on moral or feminist grounds.\nCritiques of pornography have focused on features that are shared by a\nmuch wider class of cultural products and by (some) works of erotic\nart in particular. This is not necessarily bad news for feminists. On\nthe contrary, feminists could embrace this conclusion as it implies\nthat their critiques are wider ranging than they at first appear to be\n(see Kania 2012; Mikkola (ed.) 2017; Mikkola 2019).\n5. Further questions\n\nMany more philosophical questions remain to be examined in relation to\nerotic art. The following will likely play an important role in future\nresearch on this topic. First, what exactly does it mean for a\nrepresentation to be voyeuristic and what, if anything, is the\ndifference between voyeurism in artistic and non-artistic\nrepresentations? The question was already raised in John\nBerger\u2019s classic Ways of Seeing (1972) and has since\nthen been addressed in Schellekens 2012 and Eaton 2012. The latter\nalso offers a philosophical re-interpretation of the influential but\nstrongly psychoanalytically informed concept of the \u201cmale\ngaze\u201d (Mulvey 1989). To say that a work embodies the male gaze,\nEaton submits, is simply to say that it prescribes that its audience\nperceives the woman represented as primarily a sex object. As such,\nthe tradition of the female nude in Western art promotes sexually\nobjectifying, heteronormative erotic taste, and thereby has insidious\neffects on gender equality. Following on from this, Lavallee (2016)\nargues that Eaton\u2019s thesis is mainly based on the experiences of\nwhite women and does not pay adequate attention to the lives of\nnonwhite women. This act of exclusion exposes a more general bias in\ndiscussions of female representations in art. Different kinds of\nbodies have been subjected to different kinds of objectifying\nconstrual. Lavallee therefore suggests that the ethics of nudity in\nart must be extended to take such variation into account (see also\nTaylor 2016, especially chapter 4).\n\nSecond, what is the role of transgression in erotic art? While\nfeminist philosophers have rightly highlighted the moral dangers\ninvolved in the production and dissemination of sexual imagery, other\nphilosophers and most notably Georges Bataille (1985, 1986), have\nargued that norm-breaking, and in particular the violation of social\nor moral norms about sexual behavior, is indispensable for sexual\narousal and provides a basis for other affective states, such as\ndisgust, humor, and awe, which are often in play in sexual encounters\nand representations. (For a demystified and less radical version of\nthis argument, see Newall 2012. For a general discussion of the role\nof transgression in art, see Julius 2002).\n\nThird, how does the degree of eroticism of a work of erotic art relate\nto its goodness as art, and how do the criteria for assessing erotic\nart differ from those appropriate to assessing art of other sorts? By\nreflecting on the appreciation and artistic status of art with a\nnon-artistic primary intended function, such as religious, political\nor erotic art, Davies (2012) makes a good start in answering these\nquestions.\n\nFourth, there are interesting differences between art forms that are\nworth investigating. For instance, philosophical discussions of erotic\nart have often focused on visual art or literature. But Benovsky\n(2021) draws attention to erotic experiences qua proprioceptive\nexperiences and defends the claim that, under the right circumstances,\nsuch experiences can bring about proprioceptive artworks. Adil Mustafa\nAhmad notes in relation to Islamic art that\n\n\npractically all that is perceived as erotic (acceptable, sublime) when\ndescribed in literature is seen as pornographic (off-putting and\nvulgar) if projected in painting and sculpture. (Ahmad 1994: 281)\n\n\nIn Western art, too, there appear to be different degrees of\npermissibility if one compares literature with the visual arts. How to\nexplain this? How to explain, furthermore, the absence, or\nnear-absence, of the genre of erotic art in what are sometimes called\nthe non-representational arts? There seems to be very little erotic\narchitecture and it is not entirely clear whether there is any\nabsolute music that qualifies as erotic. There are erotic dances, of\ncourse, but these are rarely performed within an art context or\nconsidered as art works.\n\nTo illuminate the latter phenomenon it might be helpful to reflect on\nissues of fictionality and imagination\u2014a fifth important\nresearch strand. As Cain Todd (2012) argues, the awareness of\nfictionality of sexual representations ensures that one\u2019s\nimaginative engagement implies merely imagined\n\u201cdesire-like\u201d states, whereas the voyeuristic appreciation\nof a stripper\u2019s erotic dance seems to preclude this sort of\nengagement, and in virtue of doing so, involves real sexual desire.\nOne might think that, characteristically, arousal-directed imagining\ntowards a sexual representation is de se in that one uses the\nimage as a prop to imagine committing or witnessing certain sexual\nacts and, indeed, Todd argues that the engagement with sexual imagery\ncan possess certain cognitive values, insofar as it involves the self\nin de se imaginative projects. But notwithstanding the\napparent plausibility of such claims, this is denied by Stock (2012)\nwho argues that enjoying erotica does not always involve imagining\nsomething about oneself.\n\nSixth, if erotic art and pornography are not mutually exclusive, why\nis there not more art that qualifies as both? Van Brabandt and Prinz\n(2012) address this question in relation to cinema. Despite the many\nresemblances between art films and pornographic films\u2014jump cuts,\nlong takes, \u201cBrechtian\u201d acting, a cinema\nv\u00e9rit\u00e9-like grittiness, arousal of strong emotions, an\nexploration of the extremes of human experience and of the margins of\nsociety\u2014they argue that market forces are mainly to be blamed\nfor the lack of overlap between the two. Mari Mikkola (2013), by\ncontrast, builds on recent work in the ontology of artifacts to\nspeculate about the possibility of porno-art\u2014a new class of\nobjects growing out of the extant categories of pornography and art,\nwithout being reducible to either one.\n\nSeventh, obscenity and censorship issues will continue to play a key\npart in research on erotic art. They crop up in philosophical\ndiscussions of the nude (Nead 1992; Hammer 1997; Danto 2000; Scruton\n2009) and of art that challenges the classical ideal of beauty\n(O\u2019Hear 1991, Danto 1995, Mey 2007). They are also central to\nstipulative distinctions between erotic art and pornography\n(Maes 2012). George P. Elliott, for instance, defines pornography\nas\n\n\nthe representation of directly or indirectly erotic acts with an\nintrusive vividness which offends decency without aesthetic\njustification. (1970: 74\u201375)\n\n\nA normative definition of this kind will bring to mind certain legal\ndescriptions of obscenity such as the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s\nnotorious Miller test, set forth in Miller v. California\n(1973). This test proposed a three-pronged criterion for obscenity:\nx is obscene if (1) it is found appealing to the prurient\ninterest by an average person applying contemporary community\nstandards, (2) it depicts sexual conduct, specifically defined by the\napplicable state law, in a patently offensive way and (3) taken as a\nwhole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific\nvalue. The Miller test has proved problematic in many respects, one of\nits most evident flaws being the conflation of two ideas\u2014the\npornographic and the obscene (Nussbaum 2004). Recent philosophical\nattempts to define the obscene have avoided this\nmistake\u2014allowing for non-pornographic obscenities and obscene\nerotic art (e.g., Kieran 2002).\n\nFinally, if erotic representations and art works help to shape how we\nsee and engage with bodies, how can they be mobilised to challenge (or\nperpetuate) oppression based on race, sexual orientation, age, size,\nand disability? Audre Lorde\u2019s \u201cUses of the Erotic\u201d\n(1978) has been a seminal text. But while Davidson (2016), Cahill\n(2016), Lintott & Irvin (2016), Mikkola (ed., 2017) and\nThorneycroft (2021) offer some recent perspectives, much more work\nstill needs to be done on this front.\n\nIn sum, it will be clear that any serious thinking about erotic art\nleads to fundamental questions about the nature of aesthetics, the\nmoral impact and status of representations, and the boundaries of art.\nAs such there can be little doubt that this topic will prove to be\nfruitful for further philosophical investigation.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Painting, Sculptures, and Photographs Referenced", "Literature and Films Referenced"], "cat_ref_text": {"Painting, Sculptures, and Photographs Referenced": "</h3>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"art\"><a href=\"http://www.musee-unterlinden.com/collections/lexperience-le-retable-dissenheim/retable/le-retable-dissenheim-un-chef-doeuvre-de-lart/\" target=\"other\"><em>Isenheim Altarpiece</em></a>\n (1512\u201316), Unterlinden Museum, Colmar, France</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Araki, Nobuyoshi, <em>The Look</em> (1993)</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Dix, Otto, <em>Old Couple</em> (1923)</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Emin, Tracey,\n <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/emin-is-anal-sex-legal-t11890\" target=\"other\"><em>Is Anal Sex Legal?</em></a>\n (1998), Tate, London</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Emin, Tracey,\n <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/emin-is-legal-sex-anal-t11889\" target=\"other\"><em>Is Legal Sex Anal?</em></a>\n (1998), Tate, London</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Grosz, George,\n <a href=\"http://collections.lacma.org/node/181305\" target=\"other\"><em>Sex Murder in the Ackerstrasse</em></a>\n (1916\u20137)</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Delacroix, Eug\u00e8ne,\n <a href=\"https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010065872\" target=\"other\"><em>Liberty Leading the People</em></a>\n (1830), Louvre</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Goya, Francisco,\n <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-nude-maja/\" target=\"other\"><em>The Naked Maja</em></a>\n (c. 1797\u20131800), Prado, Spain</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Manet, Edouard,\n <a href=\"http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire_id/olympia-7087.html\" target=\"other\"><em>Olympia</em></a>\n (1863) Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Ray, Man,\n <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/46735/man-ray-prayer-la-priere-american-negative-1930-print-1960/\" target=\"other\"><em>The Prayer</em></a>\n (1930)</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Rodin, Auguste,\n <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burghers_of_Calais\" target=\"other\"><em>The Burghers of Calais</em></a></li>\n<li class=\"art\">Scanu, Maria, <em>Madonna del Naviganti</em>\n(1999)</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Smith, Kiki, <em>Tale</em> (1992)</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Smith, Kiki,\n <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/122231\" target=\"other\"><em>Blood Pool</em></a>\n (1992)</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Tintoretto,\n <a href=\"http://www.scuolagrandesanrocco.org/home/tintoretto/sala-dellalbergo-tintoretto/\" target=\"other\"><em>Crocifissione</em></a>\n (1565), Scuola Grande di San Rocco, Venice</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Titian,\n <a href=\"http://www.uffizi.org/artworks/venus-of-urbino-by-titian/\" target=\"other\"><em>Venus of Urbino</em></a>\n (1538), Uffizi, Florence</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Titian,\n <a href=\"http://www.gardnermuseum.org/collection/artwork/3rd_floor/titian_room/europa\" target=\"other\"><em>Rape of Europa</em></a>\n (1562), Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Vermeer, Johannes,\n <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-2344\" target=\"other\"><em>Milk Maid</em></a>\n (1657\u201358), Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam</li>\n<li class=\"art\">Wegener, Gerda, <em>Les D\u00e9lassements\nd\u2019Eros</em> (1925)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"LiteFilmRefe\">", "Literature and Films Referenced": "</h3>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"art\">Bell, Jennifer Lyon &amp;
