One possible way to understand \u2018woman\u2019\nin this claim is to take it as a sex term: \u2018woman\u2019 picks\nout human females and being a human female depends on various\nbiological and anatomical features (like genitalia). Historically many\nfeminists have understood \u2018woman\u2019 differently: not as a\nsex term, but as a gender term that depends on social and cultural\nfactors (like social position). In so doing, they distinguished sex\n(being female or male) from gender (being a woman or a man), although\nmost ordinary language users appear to treat the two interchangeably.\nIn feminist philosophy, this distinction has generated a lively\ndebate. Central questions include: What does it mean for gender to be\ndistinct from sex, if anything at all? How should we understand the\nclaim that gender depends on social and/or cultural factors?

The sex/gender distinction.\n\nThe terms \u2018sex\u2019 and \u2018gender\u2019 mean different\nthings to different feminist theorists and neither are easy or\nstraightforward to characterise. Sketching out some feminist history\nof the terms provides a helpful starting point.\n1.1 Biological determinism\n\nMost people ordinarily seem to think that sex and gender are\ncoextensive: women are human females, men are human males. Many\nfeminists have historically disagreed and have endorsed the sex/\ngender distinction. Provisionally: \u2018sex\u2019 denotes human\nfemales and males depending on biological features\n(chromosomes, sex organs, hormones and other physical features);\n\u2018gender\u2019 denotes women and men depending on\nsocial factors (social role, position, behaviour or\nidentity). The main feminist motivation for making this distinction\nwas to counter biological determinism or the view that biology is\ndestiny.\n\nA typical example of a biological determinist view is that of Geddes\nand Thompson who, in 1889, argued that social, psychological and\nbehavioural traits were caused by metabolic state. Women supposedly\nconserve energy (being \u2018anabolic\u2019) and this makes them\npassive, conservative, sluggish, stable and uninterested in politics.\nMen expend their surplus energy (being \u2018katabolic\u2019) and\nthis makes them eager, energetic, passionate, variable and, thereby,\ninterested in political and social matters. These biological\n\u2018facts\u2019 about metabolic states were used not only to\nexplain behavioural differences between women and men but also to\njustify what our social and political arrangements ought to be. More\nspecifically, they were used to argue for withholding from women\npolitical rights accorded to men because (according to Geddes and\nThompson) \u201cwhat was decided among the prehistoric Protozoa\ncannot be annulled by Act of Parliament\u201d (quoted from Moi 1999,\n18). It would be inappropriate to grant women political rights, as\nthey are simply not suited to have those rights; it would also be\nfutile since women (due to their biology) would simply not be\ninterested in exercising their political rights. To counter this kind\nof biological determinism, feminists have argued that behavioural and\npsychological differences have social, rather than biological, causes.\nFor instance, Simone de Beauvoir famously claimed that one is not\nborn, but rather becomes a woman, and that \u201csocial\ndiscrimination produces in women moral and intellectual effects so\nprofound that they appear to be caused by nature\u201d (Beauvoir 1972\n[original 1949], 18; for more, see the entry on\n Simone de Beauvoir).\n Commonly observed behavioural traits associated with women and men,\nthen, are not caused by anatomy or chromosomes. Rather, they are\nculturally learned or acquired.\n\nAlthough biological determinism of the kind endorsed by Geddes and\nThompson is nowadays uncommon, the idea that behavioural and\npsychological differences between women and men have biological causes\nhas not disappeared. In the 1970s, sex differences were used to argue\nthat women should not become airline pilots since they will be\nhormonally unstable once a month and, therefore, unable to perform\ntheir duties as well as men (Rogers 1999, 11). More recently,\ndifferences in male and female brains have been said to explain\nbehavioural differences; in particular, the anatomy of corpus\ncallosum, a bundle of nerves that connects the right and left cerebral\nhemispheres, is thought to be responsible for various psychological\nand behavioural differences. For instance, in 1992, a Time\nmagazine article surveyed then prominent biological explanations of\ndifferences between women and men claiming that women\u2019s thicker\ncorpus callosums could explain what \u2018women\u2019s\nintuition\u2019 is based on and impair women\u2019s ability to\nperform some specialised visual-spatial skills, like reading maps\n(Gorman 1992). Anne Fausto-Sterling has questioned the idea that\ndifferences in corpus callosums cause behavioural and psychological\ndifferences. First, the corpus callosum is a highly variable piece of\nanatomy; as a result, generalisations about its size, shape and\nthickness that hold for women and men in general should be viewed with\ncaution. Second, differences in adult human corpus callosums are not\nfound in infants; this may suggest that physical brain differences\nactually develop as responses to differential treatment. Third, given\nthat visual-spatial skills (like map reading) can be improved by\npractice, even if women and men\u2019s corpus callosums differ, this\ndoes not make the resulting behavioural differences immutable.\n(Fausto-Sterling 2000b, chapter 5).\n1.2 Gender terminology\n\nIn order to distinguish biological differences from\nsocial/psychological ones and to talk about the latter, feminists\nappropriated the term \u2018gender\u2019. Psychologists writing on\ntranssexuality were the first to employ gender terminology in this\nsense. Until the 1960s, \u2018gender\u2019 was often used to refer\nto masculine and feminine words, like le and la in\nFrench. However, in order to explain why some people felt that they\nwere \u2018trapped in the wrong bodies\u2019, the psychologist\nRobert Stoller (1968) began using the terms \u2018sex\u2019 to pick\nout biological traits and \u2018gender\u2019 to pick out the amount\nof femininity and masculinity a person exhibited. Although (by and\nlarge) a person\u2019s sex and gender complemented each other,\nseparating out these terms seemed to make theoretical sense allowing\nStoller to explain the phenomenon of transsexuality:\ntranssexuals\u2019 sex and gender simply don\u2019t match.\n\nAlong with psychologists like Stoller, feminists found it useful to\ndistinguish sex and gender. This enabled them to argue that many\ndifferences between women and men were socially produced and,\ntherefore, changeable. Gayle Rubin (for instance) uses the phrase\n\u2018sex/gender system\u2019 in order to describe \u201ca set of\narrangements by which the biological raw material of human sex and\nprocreation is shaped by human, social intervention\u201d (1975,\n165). Rubin employed this system to articulate that \u201cpart of\nsocial life which is the locus of the oppression of women\u201d\n(1975, 159) describing gender as the \u201csocially imposed division\nof the sexes\u201d (1975, 179). Rubin\u2019s thought was that\nalthough biological differences are fixed, gender differences are the\noppressive results of social interventions that dictate how women and\nmen should behave. Women are oppressed as women and \u201cby\nhaving to be women\u201d (Rubin 1975, 204). However, since\ngender is social, it is thought to be mutable and alterable by\npolitical and social reform that would ultimately bring an end to\nwomen\u2019s subordination. Feminism should aim to create a\n\u201cgenderless (though not sexless) society, in which one\u2019s\nsexual anatomy is irrelevant to who one is, what one does, and with\nwhom one makes love\u201d (Rubin 1975, 204).\n\nIn some earlier interpretations, like Rubin\u2019s, sex and gender\nwere thought to complement one another. The slogan \u2018Gender is\nthe social interpretation of sex\u2019 captures this view. Nicholson\ncalls this \u2018the coat-rack view\u2019 of gender: our sexed\nbodies are like coat racks and \u201cprovide the site upon which\ngender [is] constructed\u201d (1994, 81). Gender conceived of as\nmasculinity and femininity is superimposed upon the\n\u2018coat-rack\u2019 of sex as each society imposes on sexed bodies\ntheir cultural conceptions of how males and females should behave.\nThis socially constructs gender differences \u2013 or the amount of\nfemininity/masculinity of a person \u2013 upon our sexed bodies. That\nis, according to this interpretation, all humans are either male or\nfemale; their sex is fixed. But cultures interpret sexed bodies\ndifferently and project different norms on those bodies thereby\ncreating feminine and masculine persons. Distinguishing sex and\ngender, however, also enables the two to come apart: they are\nseparable in that one can be sexed male and yet be gendered a woman,\nor vice versa (Haslanger 2000b; Stoljar 1995).\n\nSo, this group of feminist arguments against biological determinism\nsuggested that gender differences result from cultural practices and\nsocial expectations. Nowadays it is more common to denote this by\nsaying that gender is socially constructed. This means that genders\n(women and men) and gendered traits (like being nurturing or\nambitious) are the \u201cintended or unintended product[s] of a\nsocial practice\u201d (Haslanger 1995, 97). But which social\npractices construct gender, what social construction is and what being\nof a certain gender amounts to are major feminist controversies. There\nis no consensus on these issues. (See the entry on\n intersections between analytic and continental feminism\n for more on different ways to understand gender.)\n2. Gender as socially constructed\n2.1 Gender socialisation\n\nOne way to interpret Beauvoir\u2019s claim that one is not born but\nrather becomes a woman is to take it as a claim about gender\nsocialisation: females become women through a process whereby they\nacquire feminine traits and learn feminine behaviour. Masculinity and\nfemininity are thought to be products of nurture or how individuals\nare brought up. They are causally constructed (Haslanger\n1995, 98): social forces either have a causal role in bringing\ngendered individuals into existence or (to some substantial sense)\nshape the way we are qua women and men. And the mechanism of\nconstruction is social learning. For instance, Kate Millett takes\ngender differences to have \u201cessentially cultural, rather than\nbiological bases\u201d that result from differential treatment (1971,\n28\u20139). For her, gender is \u201cthe sum total of the\nparents\u2019, the peers\u2019, and the culture\u2019s notions of\nwhat is appropriate to each gender by way of temperament, character,\ninterests, status, worth, gesture, and expression\u201d (Millett\n1971, 31). Feminine and masculine gender-norms, however, are\nproblematic in that gendered behaviour conveniently fits with and\nreinforces women\u2019s subordination so that women are socialised\ninto subordinate social roles: they learn to be passive, ignorant,\ndocile, emotional helpmeets for men (Millett 1971, 26). However, since\nthese roles are simply learned, we can create more equal societies by\n\u2018unlearning\u2019 social roles. That is, feminists should aim\nto diminish the influence of socialisation.\n\nSocial learning theorists hold that a huge array of different\ninfluences socialise us as women and men. This being the case, it is\nextremely difficult to counter gender socialisation. For instance,\nparents often unconsciously treat their female and male children\ndifferently. When parents have been asked to describe their\n24-hour old infants, they have done so using\ngender-stereotypic language: boys are describes as strong, alert and\ncoordinated and girls as tiny, soft and delicate. Parents\u2019\ntreatment of their infants further reflects these descriptions whether\nthey are aware of this or not (Renzetti & Curran 1992, 32). Some\nsocialisation is more overt: children are often dressed in gender\nstereotypical clothes and colours (boys are dressed in blue, girls in\npink) and parents tend to buy their children gender stereotypical\ntoys. They also (intentionally or not) tend to reinforce certain\n\u2018appropriate\u2019 behaviours. While the precise form of gender\nsocialization has changed since the onset of second-wave feminism,\neven today girls are discouraged from playing sports like football or\nfrom playing \u2018rough and tumble\u2019 games and are more likely\nthan boys to be given dolls or cooking toys to play with; boys are\ntold not to \u2018cry like a baby\u2019 and are more likely to be\ngiven masculine toys like trucks and guns (for more, see Kimmel 2000,\n 122\u2013126).[1]\n\nAccording to social learning theorists, children are also influenced\nby what they observe in the world around them. This, again, makes\ncountering gender socialisation difficult. For one, children\u2019s\nbooks have portrayed males and females in blatantly stereotypical\nways: for instance, males as adventurers and leaders, and females as\nhelpers and followers. One way to address gender stereotyping in\nchildren\u2019s books has been to portray females in independent\nroles and males as non-aggressive and nurturing (Renzetti & Curran\n1992, 35). Some publishers have attempted an alternative approach by\nmaking their characters, for instance, gender-neutral animals or\ngenderless imaginary creatures (like TV\u2019s Teletubbies). However,\nparents reading books with gender-neutral or genderless characters\noften undermine the publishers\u2019 efforts by reading them to their\nchildren in ways that depict the characters as either feminine or\nmasculine. According to Renzetti and Curran, parents labelled the\noverwhelming majority of gender-neutral characters masculine whereas\nthose characters that fit feminine gender stereotypes (for instance,\nby being helpful and caring) were labelled feminine (1992, 35).\nSocialising influences like these are still thought to send implicit\nmessages regarding how females and males should act and are expected\nto act shaping us into feminine and masculine persons.\n2.2 Gender as feminine and masculine personality\n\nNancy Chodorow (1978; 1995) has criticised social learning theory as\ntoo simplistic to explain gender differences (see also Deaux &\nMajor 1990; Gatens 1996). Instead, she holds that gender is a matter\nof having feminine and masculine personalities that develop in early\ninfancy as responses to prevalent parenting practices. In particular,\ngendered personalities develop because women tend to be the primary\ncaretakers of small children. Chodorow holds that because mothers (or\nother prominent females) tend to care for infants, infant male and\nfemale psychic development differs. Crudely put: the mother-daughter\nrelationship differs from the mother-son relationship because mothers\nare more likely to identify with their daughters than their sons. This\nunconsciously prompts the mother to encourage her son to\npsychologically individuate himself from her thereby prompting him to\ndevelop well defined and rigid ego boundaries. However, the mother\nunconsciously discourages the daughter from individuating herself\nthereby prompting the daughter to develop flexible and blurry ego\nboundaries. Childhood gender socialisation further builds on and\nreinforces these unconsciously developed ego boundaries finally\nproducing feminine and masculine persons (1995, 202\u2013206). This\nperspective has its roots in Freudian psychoanalytic theory, although\nChodorow\u2019s approach differs in many ways from Freud\u2019s.\n\nGendered personalities are supposedly manifested in common gender\nstereotypical behaviour. Take emotional dependency. Women are\nstereotypically more emotional and emotionally dependent upon others\naround them, supposedly finding it difficult to distinguish their own\ninterests and wellbeing from the interests and wellbeing of their\nchildren and partners. This is said to be because of their blurry and\n(somewhat) confused ego boundaries: women find it hard to distinguish\ntheir own needs from the needs of those around them because they\ncannot sufficiently individuate themselves from those close to them.\nBy contrast, men are stereotypically emotionally detached, preferring\na career where dispassionate and distanced thinking are virtues. These\ntraits are said to result from men\u2019s well-defined ego boundaries\nthat enable them to prioritise their own needs and interests sometimes\nat the expense of others\u2019 needs and interests.\n\nChodorow thinks that these gender differences should and can be\nchanged. Feminine and masculine personalities play a crucial role in\nwomen\u2019s oppression since they make females overly attentive to\nthe needs of others and males emotionally deficient. In order to\ncorrect the situation, both male and female parents should be equally\ninvolved in parenting (Chodorow 1995, 214). This would help in\nensuring that children develop sufficiently individuated senses of\nselves without becoming overly detached, which in turn helps to\neradicate common gender stereotypical behaviours.\n2.3 Gender as feminine and masculine sexuality\n\nCatharine MacKinnon develops her theory of gender as a theory of\nsexuality. Very roughly: the social meaning of sex (gender) is created\nby sexual objectification of women whereby women are viewed and\ntreated as objects for satisfying men\u2019s desires\n(MacKinnon 1989). Masculinity is defined as sexual dominance,\nfemininity as sexual submissiveness: genders are \u201ccreated\nthrough the eroticization of dominance and submission. The man/woman\ndifference and the dominance/submission dynamic define each other.\nThis is the social meaning of sex\u201d (MacKinnon 1989, 113). For\nMacKinnon, gender is constitutively constructed: in defining\ngenders (or masculinity and femininity) we must make reference to\nsocial factors (see Haslanger 1995, 98). In particular, we must make\nreference to the position one occupies in the sexualised\ndominance/submission dynamic: men occupy the sexually dominant\nposition, women the sexually submissive one. As a result, genders are\nby definition hierarchical and this hierarchy is\nfundamentally tied to sexualised power relations. The notion of\n\u2018gender equality\u2019, then, does not make sense to MacKinnon.\nIf sexuality ceased to be a manifestation of dominance, hierarchical\ngenders (that are defined in terms of sexuality) would cease\nto exist.\n\nSo, gender difference for MacKinnon is not a matter of having a\nparticular psychological orientation or behavioural pattern; rather,\nit is a function of sexuality that is hierarchal in patriarchal\nsocieties. This is not to say that men are naturally disposed\nto sexually objectify women or that women are naturally\nsubmissive. Instead, male and female sexualities are socially\nconditioned: men have been conditioned to find women\u2019s\nsubordination sexy and women have been conditioned to find a\nparticular male version of female sexuality as erotic \u2013 one in\nwhich it is erotic to be sexually submissive. For MacKinnon, both\nfemale and male sexual desires are defined from a male point of view\nthat is conditioned by pornography (MacKinnon 1989, chapter 7).\nBluntly put: pornography portrays a false picture of \u2018what women\nwant\u2019 suggesting that women in actual fact are and want to be\nsubmissive. This conditions men\u2019s sexuality so that they view\nwomen\u2019s submission as sexy. And male dominance enforces this\nmale version of sexuality onto women, sometimes by force.\nMacKinnon\u2019s thought is not that male dominance is a result of\nsocial learning (see 2.1.); rather, socialization is an expression of\npower. That is, socialized differences in masculine and feminine\ntraits, behaviour, and roles are not responsible for power\ninequalities. Females and males (roughly put) are socialised\ndifferently because there are underlying power inequalities. As\nMacKinnon puts it, \u2018dominance\u2019 (power relations) is prior\nto \u2018difference\u2019 (traits, behaviour and roles) (see,\nMacKinnon 1989, chapter 12). MacKinnon, then, sees legal restrictions\non pornography as paramount to ending women\u2019s subordinate status\nthat stems from their gender.\n3. Problems with the sex/gender distinction\n3.1 Is gender uniform?\n\nThe positions outlined above share an underlying metaphysical\nperspective on gender: gender\n realism.[2]\n That is, women as a group are assumed to share some characteristic\nfeature, experience, common condition or criterion that defines their\ngender and the possession of which makes some individuals women (as\nopposed to, say, men). All women are thought to differ from\nall men in this respect (or respects). For example, MacKinnon\nthought that being treated in sexually objectifying ways is the common\ncondition that defines women\u2019s gender and what women as\nwomen share. All women differ from all men in this respect.\nFurther, pointing out females who are not sexually objectified does\nnot provide a counterexample to MacKinnon\u2019s view. Being sexually\nobjectified is constitutive of being a woman; a female who\nescapes sexual objectification, then, would not count as a woman.\n\nOne may want to critique the three accounts outlined by rejecting the\nparticular details of each account. (For instance, see Spelman [1988,\nchapter 4] for a critique of the details of Chodorow\u2019s view.) A\nmore thoroughgoing critique has been levelled at the general\nmetaphysical perspective of gender realism that underlies these\npositions. It has come under sustained attack on two grounds: first,\nthat it fails to take into account racial, cultural and class\ndifferences between women (particularity argument); second, that it\nposits a normative ideal of womanhood (normativity argument).\n3.1.1 Particularity argument\n\nElizabeth Spelman (1988) has influentially argued against gender\nrealism with her particularity argument. Roughly: gender realists\nmistakenly assume that gender is constructed independently of race,\nclass, ethnicity and nationality. If gender were separable from, for\nexample, race and class in this manner, all women would experience\nwomanhood in the same way. And this is clearly false. For instance,\nHarris (1993) and Stone (2007) criticise MacKinnon\u2019s view, that\nsexual objectification is the common condition that defines\nwomen\u2019s gender, for failing to take into account differences in\nwomen\u2019s backgrounds that shape their sexuality. The history of\nracist oppression illustrates that during slavery black women were\n\u2018hypersexualised\u2019 and thought to be always sexually\navailable whereas white women were thought to be pure and sexually\nvirtuous. In fact, the rape of a black woman was thought to be\nimpossible (Harris 1993). So, (the argument goes) sexual\nobjectification cannot serve as the common condition for womanhood\nsince it varies considerably depending on one\u2019s race and\n class.[3]\n\nFor Spelman, the perspective of \u2018white solipsism\u2019\nunderlies gender realists\u2019 mistake. They assumed that all women\nshare some \u201cgolden nugget of womanness\u201d (Spelman 1988,\n159) and that the features constitutive of such a nugget are the same\nfor all women regardless of their particular cultural backgrounds.\nNext, white Western middle-class feminists accounted for the shared\nfeatures simply by reflecting on the cultural features that condition\ntheir gender as women thus supposing that \u201cthe\nwomanness underneath the Black woman\u2019s skin is a white\nwoman\u2019s, and deep down inside the Latina woman is an Anglo woman\nwaiting to burst through an obscuring cultural shroud\u201d (Spelman\n1988, 13). In so doing, Spelman claims, white middle-class Western\nfeminists passed off their particular view of gender as \u201ca\nmetaphysical truth\u201d (1988, 180) thereby privileging some women\nwhile marginalising others. In failing to see the importance of race\nand class in gender construction, white middle-class Western feminists\nconflated \u201cthe condition of one group of women with the\ncondition of all\u201d (Spelman 1988, 3).\n\nBetty Friedan\u2019s (1963) well-known work is a case in point of\nwhite\n solipsism.[4]\n Friedan saw domesticity as the main vehicle of gender oppression and\ncalled upon women in general to find jobs outside the home. But she\nfailed to realize that women from less privileged backgrounds, often\npoor and non-white, already worked outside the home to support their\nfamilies. Friedan\u2019s suggestion, then, was applicable only to a\nparticular sub-group of women (white middle-class Western housewives).\nBut it was mistakenly taken to apply to all women\u2019s lives\n\u2014 a mistake that was generated by Friedan\u2019s failure to\ntake women\u2019s racial and class differences into account (hooks\n2000, 1\u20133).\n\nSpelman further holds that since social conditioning creates\nfemininity and societies (and sub-groups) that condition it differ\nfrom one another, femininity must be differently conditioned in\ndifferent societies. For her, \u201cfemales become not simply women\nbut particular kinds of women\u201d (Spelman 1988, 113): white\nworking-class women, black middle-class women, poor Jewish women,\nwealthy aristocratic European women, and so on.\n\nThis line of thought has been extremely influential in feminist\nphilosophy. For instance, Young holds that Spelman has\ndefinitively shown that gender realism is untenable (1997,\n13). Mikkola (2006) argues that this isn\u2019t so. The arguments\nSpelman makes do not undermine the idea that there is some\ncharacteristic feature, experience, common condition or criterion that\ndefines women\u2019s gender; they simply point out that some\nparticular ways of cashing out what defines womanhood are misguided.\nSo, although Spelman is right to reject those accounts that falsely\ntake the feature that conditions white middle-class Western\nfeminists\u2019 gender to condition women\u2019s gender in general,\nthis leaves open the possibility that women qua women do\nshare something that defines their gender. (See also Haslanger [2000a]\nfor a discussion of why gender realism is not necessarily untenable,\nand Stoljar [2011] for a discussion of Mikkola\u2019s critique of\nSpelman.)\n3.1.2 Normativity argument\n\nJudith Butler critiques the sex/gender distinction on two grounds.\nThey critique gender realism with their normativity argument (1999\n[original 1990], chapter 1); they also hold that the sex/gender\ndistinction is unintelligible (this will be discussed in section\n3.3.). Butler\u2019s normativity argument is not straightforwardly\ndirected at the metaphysical perspective of gender realism, but rather\nat its political counterpart: identity politics. This is a\nform of political mobilization based on membership in some group (e.g.\nracial, ethnic, cultural, gender) and group membership is thought to\nbe delimited by some common experiences, conditions or features that\ndefine the group (Heyes 2000, 58; see also the entry on\n Identity Politics).\n Feminist identity politics, then, presupposes gender realism in that\nfeminist politics is said to be mobilized around women as a group (or\ncategory) where membership in this group is fixed by some condition,\nexperience or feature that women supposedly share and that defines\ntheir gender.\n\nButler\u2019s normativity argument makes two claims. The first is\nakin to Spelman\u2019s particularity argument: unitary gender notions\nfail to take differences amongst women into account thus failing to\nrecognise \u201cthe multiplicity of cultural, social, and political\nintersections in which the concrete array of \u2018women\u2019 are\nconstructed\u201d (Butler 1999, 19\u201320). In their attempt to\nundercut biologically deterministic ways of defining what it means to\nbe a woman, feminists inadvertently created new socially constructed\naccounts of supposedly shared femininity. Butler\u2019s second claim\nis that such false gender realist accounts are normative. That is, in\ntheir attempt to fix feminism\u2019s subject matter, feminists\nunwittingly defined the term \u2018woman\u2019 in a way that implies\nthere is some correct way to be gendered a woman (Butler 1999, 5).\nThat the definition of the term \u2018woman\u2019 is fixed\nsupposedly \u201coperates as a policing force which generates and\nlegitimizes certain practices, experiences, etc., and curtails and\ndelegitimizes others\u201d (Nicholson 1998, 293). Following this line\nof thought, one could say that, for instance, Chodorow\u2019s view of\ngender suggests that \u2018real\u2019 women have feminine\npersonalities and that these are the women feminism should be\nconcerned about. If one does not exhibit a distinctly feminine\npersonality, the implication is that one is not \u2018really\u2019 a\nmember of women\u2019s category nor does one properly qualify for\nfeminist political representation.\n\nButler\u2019s second claim is based on their view\nthat\u201c[i]dentity categories [like that of women] are never merely\ndescriptive, but always normative, and as such, exclusionary\u201d\n(Butler 1991, 160). That is, the mistake of those feminists Butler\ncritiques was not that they provided the incorrect definition of\n\u2018woman\u2019. Rather, (the argument goes) their mistake was to\nattempt to define the term \u2018woman\u2019 at all. Butler\u2019s\nview is that \u2018woman\u2019 can never be defined in a way that\ndoes not prescribe some \u201cunspoken normative requirements\u201d\n(like having a feminine personality) that women should conform to\n(Butler 1999, 9). Butler takes this to be a feature of terms like\n\u2018woman\u2019 that purport to pick out (what they call)\n\u2018identity categories\u2019. They seem to assume that\n\u2018woman\u2019 can never be used in a non-ideological way (Moi\n1999, 43) and that it will always encode conditions that are not\nsatisfied by everyone we think of as women. Some explanation for this\ncomes from Butler\u2019s view that all processes of drawing\ncategorical distinctions involve evaluative and normative commitments;\nthese in turn involve the exercise of power and reflect the conditions\nof those who are socially powerful (Witt 1995).\n\nIn order to better understand Butler\u2019s critique, consider their\naccount of gender performativity. For them, standard feminist accounts\ntake gendered individuals to have some essential properties\nqua gendered individuals or a gender core by virtue of which\none is either a man or a woman. This view assumes that women and men,\nqua women and men, are bearers of various essential and\naccidental attributes where the former secure gendered persons\u2019\npersistence through time as so gendered. But according to Butler this\nview is false: (i) there are no such essential properties, and (ii)\ngender is an illusion maintained by prevalent power structures. First,\nfeminists are said to think that genders are socially constructed in\nthat they have the following essential attributes (Butler 1999, 24):\nwomen are females with feminine behavioural traits, being\nheterosexuals whose desire is directed at men; men are males with\nmasculine behavioural traits, being heterosexuals whose desire is\ndirected at women. These are the attributes necessary for gendered\nindividuals and those that enable women and men to persist through\ntime as women and men. Individuals have \u201cintelligible\ngenders\u201d (Butler 1999, 23) if they exhibit this sequence of\ntraits in a coherent manner (where sexual desire follows from sexual\norientation that in turn follows from feminine/ masculine behaviours\nthought to follow from biological sex). Social forces in general deem\nindividuals who exhibit incoherent gender sequences (like\nlesbians) to be doing their gender \u2018wrong\u2019 and they\nactively discourage such sequencing of traits, for instance, via\nname-calling and overt homophobic discrimination. Think back to what\nwas said above: having a certain conception of what women are like\nthat mirrors the conditions of socially powerful (white, middle-class,\nheterosexual, Western) women functions to marginalize and police those\nwho do not fit this conception.\n\nThese gender cores, supposedly encoding the above traits, however, are\nnothing more than illusions created by ideals and practices that seek\nto render gender uniform through heterosexism, the view that\nheterosexuality is natural and homosexuality is deviant (Butler 1999,\n42). Gender cores are constructed as if they somehow\nnaturally belong to women and men thereby creating gender dimorphism\nor the belief that one must be either a masculine male or a feminine\nfemale. But gender dimorphism only serves a heterosexist social order\nby implying that since women and men are sharply opposed, it is\nnatural to sexually desire the opposite sex or gender.\n\nFurther, being feminine and desiring men (for instance) are standardly\nassumed to be expressions of one\u2019s gender as a woman. Butler\ndenies this and holds that gender is really performative. It is not\n\u201ca stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts\nfollow; rather, gender is \u2026 instituted \u2026 through a\nstylized repetition of [habitual] acts\u201d\n(Butler 1999, 179): through wearing certain gender-coded clothing,\nwalking and sitting in certain gender-coded ways, styling one\u2019s\nhair in gender-coded manner and so on. Gender is not something one is,\nit is something one does; it is a sequence of acts, a doing rather\nthan a being. And repeatedly engaging in \u2018feminising\u2019 and\n\u2018masculinising\u2019 acts congeals gender thereby making people\nfalsely think of gender as something they naturally are.\nGender only comes into being through these gendering acts: a female\nwho has sex with men does not express her gender as a woman.\nThis activity (amongst others) makes her gendered a\nwoman.\n\nThe constitutive acts that gender individuals create genders as\n\u201ccompelling illusion[s]\u201d (Butler 1990, 271). Our gendered\nclassification scheme is a strong pragmatic construction:\nsocial factors wholly determine our use of the scheme and the scheme\nfails to represent accurately any \u2018facts of the matter\u2019\n(Haslanger 1995, 100). People think that there are true and real\ngenders, and those deemed to be doing their gender \u2018wrong\u2019\nare not socially sanctioned. But, genders are true and real only to\nthe extent that they are performed (Butler 1990, 278\u20139). It does\nnot make sense, then, to say of a male-to-female trans person that\ns/he is really a man who only appears to be a woman.\nInstead, males dressing up and acting in ways that are associated with\nfemininity \u201cshow that [as Butler suggests] \u2018being\u2019\nfeminine is just a matter of doing certain activities\u201d (Stone\n2007, 64). As a result, the trans person\u2019s gender is just as\nreal or true as anyone else\u2019s who is a\n\u2018traditionally\u2019 feminine female or masculine male (Butler\n1990,\n 278).[5]\n Without heterosexism that compels people to engage in certain\ngendering acts, there would not be any genders at all. And ultimately\nthe aim should be to abolish norms that compel people to act in these\ngendering ways.\n\nFor Butler, given that gender is performative, the appropriate\nresponse to feminist identity politics involves two things. First,\nfeminists should understand \u2018woman\u2019 as open-ended and\n\u201ca term in process, a becoming, a constructing that cannot\nrightfully be said to originate or end \u2026 it is open to\nintervention and resignification\u201d (Butler 1999, 43). That is,\nfeminists should not try to define \u2018woman\u2019 at all. Second,\nthe category of women \u201cought not to be the foundation of\nfeminist politics\u201d (Butler 1999, 9). Rather, feminists should\nfocus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our\nunderstandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also\nwithin the feminist movement.\n3.2 Is sex classification solely a matter of biology?\n\nMany people, including many feminists, have ordinarily taken sex\nascriptions to be solely a matter of biology with no social or\ncultural dimension. It is commonplace to think that there are only two\nsexes and that biological sex classifications are utterly\nunproblematic. By contrast, some feminists have argued that sex\nclassifications are not unproblematic and that they are not solely a\nmatter of biology. In order to make sense of this, it is helpful to\ndistinguish object- and idea-construction (see Haslanger 2003b for\nmore): social forces can be said to construct certain kinds of objects\n(e.g. sexed bodies or gendered individuals) and certain kinds of ideas\n(e.g. sex or gender concepts). First, take the object-construction of\nsexed bodies. Secondary sex characteristics, or the physiological and\nbiological features commonly associated with males and females, are\naffected by social practices. In some societies, females\u2019 lower\nsocial status has meant that they have been fed less and so, the lack\nof nutrition has had the effect of making them smaller in size (Jaggar\n1983, 37). Uniformity in muscular shape, size and strength within sex\ncategories is not caused entirely by biological factors, but depends\nheavily on exercise opportunities: if males and females were allowed\nthe same exercise opportunities and equal encouragement to exercise,\nit is thought that bodily dimorphism would diminish (Fausto-Sterling\n1993a, 218). A number of medical phenomena involving bones (like\nosteoporosis) have social causes directly related to expectations\nabout gender, women\u2019s diet and their exercise opportunities\n(Fausto-Sterling 2005). These examples suggest that physiological\nfeatures thought to be sex-specific traits not affected by social and\ncultural factors are, after all, to some extent products of social\nconditioning. Social conditioning, then, shapes our biology.\n\nSecond, take the idea-construction of sex concepts. Our concept of\nsex is said to be a product of social forces in the sense\nthat what counts as sex is shaped by social meanings. Standardly,\nthose with XX-chromosomes, ovaries that produce large egg cells,\nfemale genitalia, a relatively high proportion of \u2018female\u2019\nhormones, and other secondary sex characteristics (relatively small\nbody size, less body hair) count as biologically female. Those with\nXY-chromosomes, testes that produce small sperm cells, male genitalia,\na relatively high proportion of \u2018male\u2019 hormones and other\nsecondary sex traits (relatively large body size, significant amounts\nof body hair) count as male. This understanding is fairly recent. The\nprevalent scientific view from Ancient Greeks until the late\n18th century, did not consider female and male sexes to be\ndistinct categories with specific traits; instead, a \u2018one-sex\nmodel\u2019 held that males and females were members of the same sex\ncategory. Females\u2019 genitals were thought to be the same as\nmales\u2019 but simply directed inside the body; ovaries and testes\n(for instance) were referred to by the same term and whether the term\nreferred to the former or the latter was made clear by the context\n(Laqueur 1990, 4). It was not until the late 1700s that scientists\nbegan to think of female and male anatomies as radically different\nmoving away from the \u2018one-sex model\u2019 of a single sex\nspectrum to the (nowadays prevalent) \u2018two-sex model\u2019 of\nsexual dimorphism. (For an alternative view, see King 2013.)\n\nFausto-Sterling has argued that this \u2018two-sex model\u2019\nisn\u2019t straightforward either (1993b; 2000a; 2000b). Based on a\nmeta-study of empirical medical research, she estimates that 1.7% of\npopulation fail to neatly fall within the usual sex classifications\npossessing various combinations of different sex characteristics\n(Fausto-Sterling 2000a, 20). In her earlier work, she claimed that\nintersex individuals make up (at least) three further sex classes:\n\u2018herms\u2019 who possess one testis and one ovary;\n\u2018merms\u2019 who possess testes, some aspects of female\ngenitalia but no ovaries; and \u2018ferms\u2019 who have ovaries,\nsome aspects of male genitalia but no testes (Fausto-Sterling 1993b,\n21). (In her [2000a], Fausto-Sterling notes that these labels were put\nforward tongue\u2013in\u2013cheek.) Recognition of intersex people\nsuggests that feminists (and society at large) are wrong to think that\nhumans are either female or male.\n\nTo illustrate further the idea-construction of sex, consider the case\nof the athlete Maria Pati\u00f1o. Pati\u00f1o has female\ngenitalia, has always considered herself to be female and was\nconsidered so by others. However, she was discovered to have XY\nchromosomes and was barred from competing in women\u2019s sports\n(Fausto-Sterling 2000b, 1\u20133). Pati\u00f1o\u2019s genitalia\nwere at odds with her chromosomes and the latter were taken to\ndetermine her sex. Pati\u00f1o successfully fought to be recognised\nas a female athlete arguing that her chromosomes alone were not\nsufficient to not make her female. Intersex people, like\nPati\u00f1o, illustrate that our understandings of sex differ and\nsuggest that there is no immediately obvious way to settle what sex\namounts to purely biologically or scientifically. Deciding what sex is\ninvolves evaluative judgements that are influenced by social\nfactors.\n\nInsofar as our cultural conceptions affect our understandings of sex,\nfeminists must be much more careful about sex classifications and\nrethink what sex amounts to (Stone 2007, chapter 1). More\nspecifically, intersex people illustrate that sex traits associated\nwith females and males need not always go together and that\nindividuals can have some mixture of these traits. This suggests to\nStone that sex is a cluster concept: it is sufficient to\nsatisfy enough of the sex features that tend to cluster together in\norder to count as being of a particular sex. But, one need not satisfy\nall of those features or some arbitrarily chosen supposedly\nnecessary sex feature, like chromosomes (Stone 2007, 44).\nThis makes sex a matter of degree and sex classifications should take\nplace on a spectrum: one can be more or less female/male but there is\nno sharp distinction between the two. Further, intersex people (along\nwith trans people) are located at the centre of the sex spectrum and\nin many cases their sex will be indeterminate (Stone 2007).\n\nMore recently, Ayala and Vasilyeva (2015) have argued for an inclusive\nand extended conception of sex: just as certain tools can be seen to\nextend our minds beyond the limits of our brains (e.g. white canes),\nother tools (like dildos) can extend our sex beyond our bodily\nboundaries. This view aims to motivate the idea that what counts as\nsex should not be determined by looking inwards at genitalia or other\nanatomical features. In a different vein, \u00c1sta (2018) argues\nthat sex is a conferred social property. This follows her more general\nconferralist framework to analyse all social properties: properties\nthat are conferred by others thereby generating a social status that\nconsists in contextually specific constraints and enablements on\nindividual behaviour. The general schema for conferred properties is\nas follows (\u00c1sta 2018, 8):\n\n\nConferred property: what property is conferred.\n\nWho: who the subjects are.\n\nWhat: what attitude, state, or action of the subjects\nmatter.\n\nWhen: under what conditions the conferral takes\nplace.\n\nBase property: what the subjects are attempting to\ntrack (consciously or not), if anything.\n\n\nWith being of a certain sex (e.g. male, female) in mind, \u00c1sta\nholds that it is a conferred property that merely aims to track\nphysical features. Hence sex is a social \u2013 or in fact, an\ninstitutional \u2013 property rather than a natural one. The schema\nfor sex goes as follows (72):\n\n\nConferred property: being female, male.\n\nWho: legal authorities, drawing on the expert opinion\nof doctors, other medical personnel.\n\nWhat: \u201cthe recording of a sex in official\ndocuments ... The judgment of the doctors (and others) as to what sex\nrole might be the most fitting, given the biological characteristics\npresent.\u201d\n\nWhen: at birth or after surgery/ hormonal\ntreatment.\n\nBase property: \u201cthe aim is to track as many\nsex-stereotypical characteristics as possible, and doctors perform\nsurgery in cases where that might help bring the physical\ncharacteristics more in line with the stereotype of male and\nfemale.\u201d\n\n\nThis (among other things) offers a debunking analysis of sex: it may\nappear to be a natural property, but on the conferralist analysis is\nbetter understood as a conferred legal status. \u00c1sta holds that\ngender too is a conferred property, but contra the discussion in the\nfollowing section, she does not think that this collapses the\ndistinction between sex and gender: sex and gender are differently\nconferred albeit both satisfying the general schema noted above.\nNonetheless, on the conferralist framework what underlies both sex and\ngender is the idea of social construction as social significance:\nsex-stereotypical characteristics are taken to be socially significant\ncontext specifically, whereby they become the basis for conferring sex\nonto individuals and this brings with it various constraints and\nenablements on individuals and their behaviour. This fits object- and\nidea-constructions introduced above, although offers a different\ngeneral framework to analyse the matter at hand.\n3.3 Are sex and gender distinct?\n\nIn addition to arguing against identity politics and for gender\nperformativity, Butler holds that distinguishing biological\nsex from social gender is unintelligible. For them, both are\nsocially constructed:\n\nIf the immutable character of sex is contested, perhaps this construct\ncalled \u2018sex\u2019 is as culturally constructed as gender;\nindeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence\nthat the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no\ndistinction at all. (Butler 1999, 10\u201311)\n\n\n(Butler is not alone in claiming that there are no tenable\ndistinctions between nature/culture, biology/construction and\nsex/gender. See also: Antony 1998; Gatens 1996; Grosz 1994; Prokhovnik\n1999.) Butler makes two different claims in the passage cited: that\nsex is a social construction, and that sex is gender. To unpack their\nview, consider the two claims in turn. First, the idea that sex is a\nsocial construct, for Butler, boils down to the view that our sexed\nbodies are also performative and, so, they have \u201cno ontological\nstatus apart from the various acts which constitute [their]\nreality\u201d (1999, 173). Prima facie, this implausibly\nimplies that female and male bodies do not have independent existence\nand that if gendering activities ceased, so would physical bodies.\nThis is not Butler\u2019s claim; rather, their position is that\nbodies viewed as the material foundations on which gender is\nconstructed, are themselves constructed as if they provide\nsuch material foundations (Butler 1993). Cultural conceptions about\ngender figure in \u201cthe very apparatus of production whereby sexes\nthemselves are established\u201d (Butler 1999, 11).\n\nFor Butler, sexed bodies never exist outside social meanings and how\nwe understand gender shapes how we understand sex (1999, 139). Sexed\nbodies are not empty matter on which gender is constructed and sex\ncategories are not picked out on the basis of objective features of\nthe world. Instead, our sexed bodies are themselves discursively\nconstructed: they are the way they are, at least to a substantial\nextent, because of what is attributed to sexed bodies and how they are\nclassified (for discursive construction, see Haslanger 1995, 99). Sex\nassignment (calling someone female or male) is normative (Butler 1993,\n 1).[6]\n When the doctor calls a newly born infant a girl or a boy, s/he is\nnot making a descriptive claim, but a normative one. In fact, the\ndoctor is performing an illocutionary speech act (see the entry on\n Speech Acts).\n In effect, the doctor\u2019s utterance makes infants into girls or\nboys. We, then, engage in activities that make it seem as if sexes\nnaturally come in two and that being female or male is an objective\nfeature of the world, rather than being a consequence of certain\nconstitutive acts (that is, rather than being performative). And this\nis what Butler means in saying that physical bodies never exist\noutside cultural and social meanings, and that sex is as socially\nconstructed as gender. They do not deny that physical bodies exist.\nBut, they take our understanding of this existence to be a\nproduct of social conditioning: social conditioning makes the\nexistence of physical bodies intelligible to us by discursively\nconstructing sexed bodies through certain constitutive acts. (For a\nhelpful introduction to Butler\u2019s views, see Salih 2002.)\n\nFor Butler, sex assignment is always in some sense oppressive. Again,\nthis appears to be because of Butler\u2019s general suspicion of\nclassification: sex classification can never be merely descriptive but\nalways has a normative element reflecting evaluative claims of those\nwho are powerful. Conducting a feminist genealogy of the body (or\nexamining why sexed bodies are thought to come naturally as female and\nmale), then, should ground feminist practice (Butler 1993,\n28\u20139). Feminists should examine and uncover ways in which social\nconstruction and certain acts that constitute sex shape our\nunderstandings of sexed bodies, what kinds of meanings bodies acquire\nand which practices and illocutionary speech acts \u2018make\u2019\nour bodies into sexes. Doing so enables feminists to identity how\nsexed bodies are socially constructed in order to resist such\nconstruction.\n\nHowever, given what was said above, it is far from obvious what we\nshould make of Butler\u2019s claim that sex \u201cwas always already\ngender\u201d (1999, 11). Stone (2007) takes this to mean that sex\nis gender but goes on to question it arguing that the social\nconstruction of both sex and gender does not make sex identical to\ngender. According to Stone, it would be more accurate for Butler to\nsay that claims about sex imply gender norms. That is, many\nclaims about sex traits (like \u2018females are physically weaker\nthan males\u2019) actually carry implications about how women and men\nare expected to behave. To some extent the claim describes certain\nfacts. But, it also implies that females are not expected to do much\nheavy lifting and that they would probably not be good at it. So,\nclaims about sex are not identical to claims about gender; rather,\nthey imply claims about gender norms (Stone 2007, 70).\n3.4 Is the sex/gender distinction useful?\n\nSome feminists hold that the sex/gender distinction is not useful. For\na start, it is thought to reflect politically problematic dualistic\nthinking that undercuts feminist aims: the distinction is taken to\nreflect and replicate androcentric oppositions between (for instance)\nmind/body, culture/nature and reason/emotion that have been used to\njustify women\u2019s oppression (e.g. Grosz 1994; Prokhovnik 1999).\nThe thought is that in oppositions like these, one term is always\nsuperior to the other and that the devalued term is usually associated\nwith women (Lloyd 1993). For instance, human subjectivity and agency\nare identified with the mind but since women are usually identified\nwith their bodies, they are devalued as human subjects and agents. The\nopposition between mind and body is said to further map on to other\ndistinctions, like reason/emotion, culture/nature,\nrational/irrational, where one side of each distinction is devalued\n(one\u2019s bodily features are usually valued less that one\u2019s\nmind, rationality is usually valued more than irrationality) and women\nare associated with the devalued terms: they are thought to be closer\nto bodily features and nature than men, to be irrational, emotional\nand so on. This is said to be evident (for instance) in job\ninterviews. Men are treated as gender-neutral persons and not asked\nwhether they are planning to take time off to have a family. By\ncontrast, that women face such queries illustrates that they are\nassociated more closely than men with bodily features to do with\nprocreation (Prokhovnik 1999, 126). The opposition between mind and\nbody, then, is thought to map onto the opposition between men and\nwomen.\n\nNow, the mind/body dualism is also said to map onto the sex/gender\ndistinction (Grosz 1994; Prokhovnik 1999). The idea is that gender\nmaps onto mind, sex onto body. Although not used by those endorsing\nthis view, the basic idea can be summed by the slogan \u2018Gender is\nbetween the ears, sex is between the legs\u2019: the implication is\nthat, while sex is immutable, gender is something individuals have\ncontrol over \u2013 it is something we can alter and change through\nindividual choices. However, since women are said to be more closely\nassociated with biological features (and so, to map onto the body side\nof the mind/body distinction) and men are treated as gender-neutral\npersons (mapping onto the mind side), the implication is that\n\u201cman equals gender, which is associated with mind and choice,\nfreedom from body, autonomy, and with the public real; while woman\nequals sex, associated with the body, reproduction,\n\u2018natural\u2019 rhythms and the private realm\u201d (Prokhovnik\n1999, 103). This is said to render the sex/gender distinction\ninherently repressive and to drain it of any potential for\nemancipation: rather than facilitating gender role choice for women,\nit \u201cactually functions to reinforce their association with body,\nsex, and involuntary \u2018natural\u2019 rhythms\u201d (Prokhovnik\n1999, 103). Contrary to what feminists like Rubin argued, the\nsex/gender distinction cannot be used as a theoretical tool that\ndissociates conceptions of womanhood from biological and reproductive\nfeatures.\n\nMoi has further argued that the sex/gender distinction is useless\ngiven certain theoretical goals (1999, chapter 1). This is not to say\nthat it is utterly worthless; according to Moi, the sex/gender\ndistinction worked well to show that the historically prevalent\nbiological determinism was false. However, for her, the distinction\ndoes no useful work \u201cwhen it comes to producing a good theory of\nsubjectivity\u201d (1999, 6) and \u201ca concrete, historical\nunderstanding of what it means to be a woman (or a man) in a given\nsociety\u201d (1999, 4\u20135). That is, the 1960s distinction\nunderstood sex as fixed by biology without any cultural or historical\ndimensions. This understanding, however, ignores lived experiences and\nembodiment as aspects of womanhood (and manhood) by separating sex\nfrom gender and insisting that womanhood is to do with the latter.\nRather, embodiment must be included in one\u2019s theory that tries\nto figure out what it is to be a woman (or a man).\n\nMikkola (2011) argues that the sex/gender distinction, which underlies\nviews like Rubin\u2019s and MacKinnon\u2019s, has certain\nunintuitive and undesirable ontological commitments that render the\ndistinction politically unhelpful. First, claiming that gender is\nsocially constructed implies that the existence of women and men is a\nmind-dependent matter. This suggests that we can do away with women\nand men simply by altering some social practices, conventions or\nconditions on which gender depends (whatever those are). However,\nordinary social agents find this unintuitive given that (ordinarily)\nsex and gender are not distinguished. Second, claiming that gender is\na product of oppressive social forces suggests that doing away with\nwomen and men should be feminism\u2019s political goal. But this\nharbours ontologically undesirable commitments since many ordinary\nsocial agents view their gender to be a source of positive value. So,\nfeminism seems to want to do away with something that should not be\ndone away with, which is unlikely to motivate social agents to act in\nways that aim at gender justice. Given these problems, Mikkola argues\nthat feminists should give up the distinction on practical political\ngrounds.\n\nTomas Bogardus (2020) has argued in an even more radical sense against\nthe sex/gender distinction: as things stand, he holds, feminist\nphilosophers have merely assumed and asserted that the distinction\nexists, instead of having offered good arguments for the distinction.\nIn other words, feminist philosophers allegedly have yet to offer good\nreasons to think that \u2018woman\u2019 does not simply\npick out adult human females. Alex Byrne (2020) argues in a similar\nvein: the term \u2018woman\u2019 does not pick out a social kind as\nfeminist philosophers have \u201cassumed\u201d. Instead,\n\u201cwomen are adult human females\u2013nothing more, and nothing\nless\u201d (2020, 3801). Byrne offers six considerations to ground\nthis AHF (adult, human, female) conception.\n\nIt reproduces the dictionary definition of\n\u2018woman\u2019.\nOne would expect English to have a word that picks out the\ncategory adult human female, and \u2018woman\u2019 is the only\ncandidate.\nAHF explains how we sometimes know that an individual is a woman,\ndespite knowing nothing else relevant about her other than the fact\nthat she is an adult human female.\nAHF stands or falls with the analogous thesis for girls, which can\nbe supported independently.\nAHF predicts the correct verdict in cases of gender role\nreversal.\nAHF is supported by the fact that \u2018woman\u2019 and\n\u2018female\u2019 are often appropriately used as stylistic\nvariants of each other, even in\n hyperintensional\n contexts.\n\n\nRobin Dembroff (2021) responds to Byrne and highlights various\nproblems with Byrne\u2019s argument. First, framing: Byrne assumes\nfrom the start that gender terms like \u2018woman\u2019 have a\nsingle invariant meaning thereby failing to discuss the possibility of\nterms like \u2018woman\u2019 having multiple meanings \u2013\nsomething that is a familiar claim made by feminist theorists from\nvarious disciplines. Moreover, Byrne (according to Dembroff) assumes\nwithout argument that there is a single, universal category of woman\n\u2013 again, something that has been extensively discussed and\ncritiqued by feminist philosophers and theorists. Second,\nByrne\u2019s conception of the \u2018dominant\u2019\nmeaning of woman is said to be cherry-picked and it ignores a\nwealth of contexts outside of philosophy (like the media and the law)\nwhere \u2018woman\u2019 has a meaning other than AHF.\nThird, Byrne\u2019s own distinction between biological and social\ncategories fails to establish what he intended to establish: namely,\nthat \u2018woman\u2019 picks out a biological rather than a social\nkind. Hence, Dembroff holds, Byrne\u2019s case fails by its own\nlights. Byrne (2021) responds to Dembroff\u2019s critique.\n\nOthers such as \u2018gender critical feminists\u2019 also hold views\nabout the sex/gender distinction in a spirit similar to Bogardus and\nByrne. For example, Holly Lawford-Smith (2021) takes the prevalent\nsex/gender distinction, where \u2018female\u2019/\u2018male\u2019\nare used as sex terms and \u2018woman\u2019/\u2019man\u2019 as\ngender terms, not to be helpful. Instead, she takes all of these to be\nsex terms and holds that (the norms of) femininity/masculinity refer\nto gender normativity. Because much of the gender critical\nfeminists\u2019 discussion that philosophers have engaged in has\ntaken place in social media, public fora, and other sources outside\nacademic philosophy, this entry will not focus on these\ndiscussions.\n4. Women as a group\n\nThe various critiques of the sex/gender distinction have called into\nquestion the viability of the category women. Feminism is the\nmovement to end the oppression women as a group face. But, how should\nthe category of women be understood if feminists accept the above\narguments that gender construction is not uniform, that a sharp\ndistinction between biological sex and social gender is false or (at\nleast) not useful, and that various features associated with women\nplay a role in what it is to be a woman, none of which are\nindividually necessary and jointly sufficient (like a variety of\nsocial roles, positions, behaviours, traits, bodily features and\nexperiences)? Feminists must be able to address cultural and social\ndifferences in gender construction if feminism is to be a genuinely\ninclusive movement and be careful not to posit commonalities that mask\nimportant ways in which women qua women differ. These\nconcerns (among others) have generated a situation where (as Linda\nAlcoff puts it) feminists aim to speak and make political demands in\nthe name of women, at the same time rejecting the idea that there is a\nunified category of women (2006, 152). If feminist critiques of the\ncategory women are successful, then what (if anything) binds\nwomen together, what is it to be a woman, and what kinds of demands\ncan feminists make on behalf of women?\n\nMany have found the fragmentation of the category of women problematic\nfor political reasons (e.g. Alcoff 2006; Bach 2012; Benhabib 1992;\nFrye 1996; Haslanger 2000b; Heyes 2000; Martin 1994; Mikkola 2007;\nStoljar 1995; Stone 2004; Tanesini 1996; Young 1997; Zack 2005). For\ninstance, Young holds that accounts like Spelman\u2019s reduce the\ncategory of women to a gerrymandered collection of individuals with\nnothing to bind them together (1997, 20). Black women differ from\nwhite women but members of both groups also differ from one another\nwith respect to nationality, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation and\neconomic position; that is, wealthy white women differ from\nworking-class white women due to their economic and class positions.\nThese sub-groups are themselves diverse: for instance, some\nworking-class white women in Northern Ireland are starkly divided\nalong religious lines. So if we accept Spelman\u2019s position, we\nrisk ending up with individual women and nothing to bind them\ntogether. And this is problematic: in order to respond to oppression\nof women in general, feminists must understand them as a category in\nsome sense. Young writes that without doing so \u201cit is not\npossible to conceptualize oppression as a systematic, structured,\ninstitutional process\u201d (1997, 17). Some, then, take the\narticulation of an inclusive category of women to be the prerequisite\nfor effective feminist politics and a rich literature has emerged that\naims to conceptualise women as a group or a collective (e.g. Alcoff\n2006; \u00c1sta 2011; Frye 1996; 2011; Haslanger 2000b; Heyes 2000;\nStoljar 1995, 2011; Young 1997; Zack 2005). Articulations of this\ncategory can be divided into those that are: (a) gender nominalist\n\u2014 positions that deny there is something women qua\nwomen share and that seek to unify women\u2019s social kind by\nappealing to something external to women; and (b) gender realist\n\u2014 positions that take there to be something women qua\nwomen share (although these realist positions differ significantly\nfrom those outlined in Section 2). Below we will review some\ninfluential gender nominalist and gender realist positions. Before\ndoing so, it is worth noting that not everyone is convinced that\nattempts to articulate an inclusive category of women can succeed or\nthat worries about what it is to be a woman are in need of being\nresolved. Mikkola (2016) argues that feminist politics need not rely\non overcoming (what she calls) the \u2018gender controversy\u2019:\nthat feminists must settle the meaning of gender concepts and\narticulate a way to ground women\u2019s social kind membership. As\nshe sees it, disputes about \u2018what it is to be a woman\u2019\nhave become theoretically bankrupt and intractable, which has\ngenerated an analytical impasse that looks unsurpassable. Instead,\nMikkola argues for giving up the quest, which in any case in her view\nposes no serious political obstacles.\n\nElizabeth Barnes (2020) responds to the need to offer an inclusive\nconception of gender somewhat differently, although she endorses the\nneed for feminism to be inclusive particularly of trans people. Barnes\nholds that typically philosophical theories of gender aim to offer an\naccount of what it is to be a woman (or man, genderqueer, etc.), where\nsuch an account is presumed to provide necessary and sufficient\nconditions for being a woman or an account of our gender terms\u2019\nextensions. But, she holds, it is a mistake to expect our theories of\ngender to do so. For Barnes, a project that offers a metaphysics of\ngender \u201cshould be understood as the project of theorizing what\nit is \u2014if anything\u2014 about the social world that ultimately\nexplains gender\u201d (2020, 706). This project is not equivalent to\none that aims to define gender terms or elucidate the application\nconditions for natural language gender terms though.\n4.1 Gender nominalism\n4.1.1 Gendered social series\n\nIris Young argues that unless there is \u201csome sense in which\n\u2018woman\u2019 is the name of a social collective [that feminism\nrepresents], there is nothing specific to feminist politics\u201d\n(1997, 13). In order to make the category women intelligible,\nshe argues that women make up a series: a particular kind of social\ncollective \u201cwhose members are unified passively by the objects\ntheir actions are oriented around and/or by the objectified results of\nthe material effects of the actions of the other\u201d (Young 1997,\n23). A series is distinct from a group in that, whereas members of\ngroups are thought to self-consciously share certain goals, projects,\ntraits and/ or self-conceptions, members of series pursue their own\nindividual ends without necessarily having anything at all in common.\nYoung holds that women are not bound together by a shared feature or\nexperience (or set of features and experiences) since she takes\nSpelman\u2019s particularity argument to have established definitely\nthat no such feature exists (1997, 13; see also: Frye 1996; Heyes\n2000). Instead, women\u2019s category is unified by certain\npractico-inert realities or the ways in which women\u2019s lives and\ntheir actions are oriented around certain objects and everyday\nrealities (Young 1997, 23\u20134). For example, bus commuters make up\na series unified through their individual actions being organised\naround the same practico-inert objects of the bus and the practice of\npublic transport. Women make up a series unified through women\u2019s\nlives and actions being organised around certain practico-inert\nobjects and realities that position them as women.\n\nYoung identifies two broad groups of such practico-inert objects and\nrealities. First, phenomena associated with female bodies (physical\nfacts), biological processes that take place in female bodies\n(menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth) and social rules associated with\nthese biological processes (social rules of menstruation, for\ninstance). Second, gender-coded objects and practices: pronouns,\nverbal and visual representations of gender, gender-coded artefacts\nand social spaces, clothes, cosmetics, tools and furniture. So, women\nmake up a series since their lives and actions are organised around\nfemale bodies and certain gender-coded objects. Their series is bound\ntogether passively and the unity is \u201cnot one that arises from\nthe individuals called women\u201d (Young 1997, 32).\n\nAlthough Young\u2019s proposal purports to be a response to\nSpelman\u2019s worries, Stone has questioned whether it is, after\nall, susceptible to the particularity argument: ultimately, on\nYoung\u2019s view, something women as women share (their\npractico-inert realities) binds them together (Stone 2004).\n4.1.2 Resemblance nominalism\n\nNatalie Stoljar holds that unless the category of women is unified,\nfeminist action on behalf of women cannot be justified (1995, 282).\nStoljar too is persuaded by the thought that women qua women\ndo not share anything unitary. This prompts her to argue for\nresemblance nominalism. This is the view that a certain kind of\nresemblance relation holds between entities of a particular type (for\nmore on resemblance nominalism, see Armstrong 1989, 39\u201358).\nStoljar is not alone in arguing for resemblance relations to make\nsense of women as a category; others have also done so, usually\nappealing to Wittgenstein\u2019s \u2018family resemblance\u2019\nrelations (Alcoff 1988; Green & Radford Curry 1991; Heyes 2000;\nMunro 2006). Stoljar relies more on Price\u2019s resemblance\nnominalism whereby x is a member of some type F only\nif x resembles some paradigm or exemplar of F\nsufficiently closely (Price 1953, 20). For instance, the type of red\nentities is unified by some chosen red paradigms so that only those\nentities that sufficiently resemble the paradigms count as red. The\ntype (or category) of women, then, is unified by some chosen woman\nparadigms so that those who sufficiently resemble the woman paradigms\ncount as women (Stoljar 1995, 284).\n\nSemantic considerations about the concept woman suggest to\nStoljar that resemblance nominalism should be endorsed (Stoljar 2000,\n28). It seems unlikely that the concept is applied on the basis of\nsome single social feature all and only women possess. By contrast,\nwoman is a cluster concept and our attributions of womanhood\npick out \u201cdifferent arrangements of features in different\nindividuals\u201d (Stoljar 2000, 27). More specifically, they pick\nout the following clusters of features: (a) Female sex; (b)\nPhenomenological features: menstruation, female sexual experience,\nchild-birth, breast-feeding, fear of walking on the streets at night\nor fear of rape; (c) Certain roles: wearing typically female clothing,\nbeing oppressed on the basis of one\u2019s sex or undertaking\ncare-work; (d) Gender attribution: \u201ccalling oneself a woman,\nbeing called a woman\u201d (Stoljar 1995, 283\u20134). For Stoljar,\nattributions of womanhood are to do with a variety of traits and\nexperiences: those that feminists have historically termed\n\u2018gender traits\u2019 (like social, behavioural, psychological\ntraits) and those termed \u2018sex traits\u2019.\nNonetheless, she holds that since the concept woman applies\nto (at least some) trans persons, one can be a woman without being\nfemale (Stoljar 1995, 282).\n\nThe cluster concept woman does not, however,\nstraightforwardly provide the criterion for picking out the category\nof women. Rather, the four clusters of features that the concept picks\nout help single out woman paradigms that in turn help single out the\ncategory of women. First, any individual who possesses a\nfeature from at least three of the four clusters mentioned\nwill count as an exemplar of the category. For instance, an\nAfrican-American with primary and secondary female sex\ncharacteristics, who describes herself as a woman and is oppressed on\nthe basis of her sex, along with a white European hermaphrodite\nbrought up \u2018as a girl\u2019, who engages in female roles and\nhas female phenomenological features despite lacking female sex\ncharacteristics, will count as woman paradigms (Stoljar 1995,\n 284).[7]\n Second, any individual who resembles \u201cany of the paradigms\nsufficiently closely (on Price\u2019s account, as closely as [the\nparadigms] resemble each other) will be a member of the resemblance\nclass \u2018woman\u2019\u201d (Stoljar 1995, 284). That is, what\ndelimits membership in the category of women is that one resembles\nsufficiently a woman paradigm.\n\n4.2 Neo-gender realism\n4.2.1 Social subordination and gender\n\nIn a series of articles collected in her 2012 book, Sally Haslanger\nargues for a way to define the concept woman that is\npolitically useful, serving as a tool in feminist fights against\nsexism, and that shows woman to be a social (not a\nbiological) notion. More specifically, Haslanger argues that gender is\na matter of occupying either a subordinate or a privileged social\nposition. In some articles, Haslanger is arguing for a revisionary\nanalysis of the concept woman (2000b; 2003a; 2003b).\nElsewhere she suggests that her analysis may not be that revisionary\nafter all (2005; 2006). Consider the former argument first.\nHaslanger\u2019s analysis is, in her terms, ameliorative: it aims to\nelucidate which gender concepts best help feminists achieve their\nlegitimate purposes thereby elucidating those concepts feminists\nshould be using (Haslanger 2000b,\n 33).[8]\n Now, feminists need gender terminology in order to fight sexist\ninjustices (Haslanger 2000b, 36). In particular, they need gender\nterms to identify, explain and talk about persistent social\ninequalities between males and females. Haslanger\u2019s analysis of\ngender begins with the recognition that females and males differ in\ntwo respects: physically and in their social positions. Societies in\ngeneral tend to \u201cprivilege individuals with male bodies\u201d\n(Haslanger 2000b, 38) so that the social positions they subsequently\noccupy are better than the social positions of those with female\nbodies. And this generates persistent sexist injustices. With this in\nmind, Haslanger specifies how she understands genders:\n\nS is a woman iff [by definition] S is\nsystematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political,\nlegal, social, etc.), and S is \u2018marked\u2019 as a\ntarget for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features\npresumed to be evidence of a female\u2019s biological role in\nreproduction.\n\n\nS is a man iff [by definition] S is\nsystematically privileged along some dimension (economic, political,\nlegal, social, etc.), and S is \u2018marked\u2019 as a\ntarget for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features\npresumed to be evidence of a male\u2019s biological role in\nreproduction. (2003a, 6\u20137)\n\n\nThese are constitutive of being a woman and a man:\nwhat makes calling S a woman apt, is that S is\noppressed on sex-marked grounds; what makes calling S a man\napt, is that S is privileged on sex-marked grounds.\n\nHaslanger\u2019s ameliorative analysis is counterintuitive in that\nfemales who are not sex-marked for oppression, do not count as women.\nAt least arguably, the Queen of England is not oppressed on sex-marked\ngrounds and so, would not count as a woman on Haslanger\u2019s\ndefinition. And, similarly, all males who are not privileged would not\ncount as men. This might suggest that Haslanger\u2019s analysis\nshould be rejected in that it does not capture what language users\nhave in mind when applying gender terms. However, Haslanger argues\nthat this is not a reason to reject the definitions, which she takes\nto be revisionary: they are not meant to capture our intuitive gender\nterms. In response, Mikkola (2009) has argued that revisionary\nanalyses of gender concepts, like Haslanger\u2019s, are both\npolitically unhelpful and philosophically unnecessary.\n\nNote also that Haslanger\u2019s proposal is eliminativist: gender\njustice would eradicate gender, since it would abolish those sexist\nsocial structures responsible for sex-marked oppression and privilege.\nIf sexist oppression were to cease, women and men would no longer\nexist (although there would still be males and females). Not all\nfeminists endorse such an eliminativist view though. Stone holds that\nHaslanger does not leave any room for positively revaluing what it is\nto be a woman: since Haslanger defines woman in terms of\nsubordination,\n\nany woman who challenges her subordinate status must by definition be\nchallenging her status as a woman, even if she does not intend to\n\u2026 positive change to our gender norms would involve getting rid\nof the (necessarily subordinate) feminine gender. (Stone 2007, 160)\n\n\nBut according to Stone this is not only undesirable \u2013 one should\nbe able to challenge subordination without having to challenge\none\u2019s status as a woman. It is also false: \u201cbecause norms\nof femininity can be and constantly are being revised, women can be\nwomen without thereby being subordinate\u201d (Stone 2007, 162;\nMikkola [2016] too argues that Haslanger\u2019s eliminativism is\ntroublesome).\n\nTheodore Bach holds that Haslanger\u2019s eliminativism is\nundesirable on other grounds, and that Haslanger\u2019s position\nfaces another more serious problem. Feminism faces the following\nworries (among others):\n\n\nRepresentation problem: \u201cif there is no real group of\n\u2018women\u2019, then it is incoherent to make moral claims and\nadvance political policies on behalf of women\u201d (Bach 2012,\n234).\n\nCommonality problems: (1) There is no feature that all women\ncross-culturally and transhistorically share. (2) Delimiting\nwomen\u2019s social kind with the help of some essential property\nprivileges those who possess it, and marginalizes those who do not\n(Bach 2012, 235).\n\n\nAccording to Bach, Haslanger\u2019s strategy to resolve these\nproblems appeals to \u2018social objectivism\u2019. First, we define\nwomen \u201caccording to a suitably abstract relational\nproperty\u201d (Bach 2012, 236), which avoids the commonality\nproblems. Second, Haslanger employs \u201can ontologically thin\nnotion of \u2018objectivity\u2019\u201d (Bach 2012, 236) that\nanswers the representation problem. Haslanger\u2019s solution (Bach\nholds) is specifically to argue that women make up an objective type\nbecause women are objectively similar to one another, and not simply\nclassified together given our background conceptual schemes. Bach\nclaims though that Haslanger\u2019s account is not objective enough,\nand we should on political grounds \u201cprovide a stronger\nontological characterization of the genders men and\nwomen according to which they are natural kinds with\nexplanatory essences\u201d (Bach 2012, 238). He thus proposes that\nwomen make up a natural kind with a historical essence:\n\nThe essential property of women, in virtue of which an individual is a\nmember of the kind \u2018women,\u2019 is participation in a lineage\nof women. In order to exemplify this relational property, an\nindividual must be a reproduction of ancestral women, in which case\nshe must have undergone the ontogenetic processes through which a\nhistorical gender system replicates women. (Bach 2012, 271)\n\n\nIn short, one is not a woman due to shared surface properties with\nother women (like occupying a subordinate social position). Rather,\none is a woman because one has the right history: one has undergone\nthe ubiquitous ontogenetic process of gender socialization. Thinking\nabout gender in this way supposedly provides a stronger kind unity\nthan Haslanger\u2019s that simply appeals to shared surface\nproperties.\n\nNot everyone agrees; Mikkola (2020) argues that Bach\u2019s\nmetaphysical picture has internal tensions that render it puzzling and\nthat Bach\u2019s metaphysics does not provide good responses to the\ncommonality and presentation problems. The historically essentialist\nview also has anti-trans implications. After all, trans women who have\nnot undergone female gender socialization won\u2019t count as women\non his view (Mikkola [2016, 2020] develops this line of critique in\nmore detail). More worryingly, trans women will count as men contrary\nto their self-identification. Both Bettcher (2013) and Jenkins (2016)\nconsider the importance of gender self-identification. Bettcher argues\nthat there is more than one \u2018correct\u2019 way to understand\nwomanhood: at the very least, the dominant (mainstream), and the\nresistant (trans) conceptions. Dominant views like that of\nBach\u2019s tend to erase trans people\u2019s experiences and to\nmarginalize trans women within feminist movements. Rather than trans\nwomen having to defend their self-identifying claims, these claims\nshould be taken at face value right from the start. And so, Bettcher\nholds, \u201cin analyzing the meaning of terms such as\n\u2018woman,\u2019 it is inappropriate to dismiss alternative ways\nin which those terms are actually used in trans subcultures; such\nusage needs to be taken into consideration as part of the\nanalysis\u201d (2013, 235).\n\nSpecifically with Haslanger in mind and in a similar vein, Jenkins\n(2016) discusses how Haslanger\u2019s revisionary approach unduly\nexcludes some trans women from women\u2019s social kind. On\nJenkins\u2019s view, Haslanger\u2019s ameliorative methodology in\nfact yields more than one satisfying target concept: one that\n\u201ccorresponds to Haslanger\u2019s proposed concept and captures\nthe sense of gender as an imposed social class\u201d; another that\n\u201ccaptures the sense of gender as a lived identity\u201d\n(Jenkins 2016, 397). The latter of these allows us to include trans\nwomen into women\u2019s social kind, who on Haslanger\u2019s social\nclass approach to gender would inappropriately have been excluded.\n(See Andler 2017 for the view that Jenkins\u2019s purportedly\ninclusive conception of gender is still not fully inclusive. Jenkins\n2018 responds to this charge and develops the notion of gender\nidentity still further.)\n\nIn addition to her revisionary argument, Haslanger has suggested that\nher ameliorative analysis of woman may not be as revisionary\nas it first seems (2005, 2006). Although successful in their reference\nfixing, ordinary language users do not always know precisely what they\nare talking about. Our language use may be skewed by oppressive\nideologies that can \u201cmislead us about the content of our own\nthoughts\u201d (Haslanger 2005, 12). Although her gender terminology\nis not intuitive, this could simply be because oppressive ideologies\nmislead us about the meanings of our gender terms. Our everyday gender\nterminology might mean something utterly different from what we\nthink it means; and we could be entirely ignorant of this.\nPerhaps Haslanger\u2019s analysis, then, has captured our everyday\ngender vocabulary revealing to us the terms that we actually employ:\nwe may be applying \u2018woman\u2019 in our everyday language on the\nbasis of sex-marked subordination whether we take ourselves to be\ndoing so or not. If this is so, Haslanger\u2019s gender terminology\nis not radically revisionist.\n\nSaul (2006) argues that, despite it being possible that we unknowingly\napply \u2018woman\u2019 on the basis of social subordination, it is\nextremely difficult to show that this is the case. This would require\nshowing that the gender terminology we in fact employ is\nHaslanger\u2019s proposed gender terminology. But discovering the\ngrounds on which we apply everyday gender terms is extremely difficult\nprecisely because they are applied in various and idiosyncratic ways\n(Saul 2006, 129). Haslanger, then, needs to do more in order to show\nthat her analysis is non-revisionary.\n4.2.2 Gender uniessentialism\n\nCharlotte Witt (2011a; 2011b) argues for a particular sort of gender\nessentialism, which Witt terms \u2018uniessentialism\u2019. Her\nmotivation and starting point is the following: many ordinary social\nagents report gender being essential to them and claim that they would\nbe a different person were they of a different sex/gender.\nUniessentialism attempts to understand and articulate this. However,\nWitt\u2019s work departs in important respects from the earlier\n(so-called) essentialist or gender realist positions discussed in\nSection 2: Witt does not posit some essential property of womanhood of\nthe kind discussed above, which failed to take women\u2019s\ndifferences into account. Further, uniessentialism differs\nsignificantly from those position developed in response to the problem\nof how we should conceive of women\u2019s social kind. It is not\nabout solving the standard dispute between gender nominalists and\ngender realists, or about articulating some supposedly shared property\nthat binds women together and provides a theoretical ground for\nfeminist political solidarity. Rather, uniessentialism aims to make\ngood the widely held belief that gender is constitutive of who we\n are.[9]\n\nUniessentialism is a sort of individual essentialism. Traditionally\nphilosophers distinguish between kind and individual essentialisms:\nthe former examines what binds members of a kind together and what do\nall members of some kind have in common qua members of that\nkind. The latter asks: what makes an individual the\nindividual it is. We can further distinguish two sorts of individual\nessentialisms: Kripkean identity essentialism and Aristotelian\nuniessentialism. The former asks: what makes an individual\nthat individual? The latter, however, asks a slightly\ndifferent question: what explains the unity of individuals? What\nexplains that an individual entity exists over and above the sum total\nof its constituent parts? (The standard feminist debate over gender\nnominalism and gender realism has largely been about kind\nessentialism. Being about individual essentialism, Witt\u2019s\nuniessentialism departs in an important way from the standard debate.)\nFrom the two individual essentialisms, Witt endorses the Aristotelian\none. On this view, certain functional essences have a unifying role:\nthese essences are responsible for the fact that material parts\nconstitute a new individual, rather than just a lump of stuff or a\ncollection of particles. Witt\u2019s example is of a house: the\nessential house-functional property (what the entity is for, what its\npurpose is) unifies the different material parts of a house so that\nthere is a house, and not just a collection of house-constituting\nparticles (2011a, 6). Gender (being a woman/a man) functions in a\nsimilar fashion and provides \u201cthe principle of normative\nunity\u201d that organizes, unifies and determines the roles of\nsocial individuals (Witt 2011a, 73). Due to this, gender is a\nuniessential property of social individuals.\n\nIt is important to clarify the notions of gender and\nsocial individuality that Witt employs. First, gender is a\nsocial position that \u201ccluster[s] around the engendering function\n\u2026 women conceive and bear \u2026 men beget\u201d (Witt\n2011a, 40). These are women and men\u2019s socially mediated\nreproductive functions (Witt 2011a, 29) and they differ from the\nbiological function of reproduction, which roughly corresponds to sex\non the standard sex/gender distinction. Witt writes: \u201cto be a\nwoman is to be recognized to have a particular function in\nengendering, to be a man is to be recognized to have a different\nfunction in engendering\u201d (2011a, 39). Second, Witt distinguishes\npersons (those who possess self-consciousness), human\nbeings (those who are biologically human) and social\nindividuals (those who occupy social positions synchronically and\ndiachronically). These ontological categories are not equivalent in\nthat they possess different persistence and identity conditions.\nSocial individuals are bound by social normativity, human beings by\nbiological normativity. These normativities differ in two respects:\nfirst, social norms differ from one culture to the next whereas\nbiological norms do not; second, unlike biological normativity, social\nnormativity requires \u201cthe recognition by others that an agent is\nboth responsive to and evaluable under a social norm\u201d (Witt\n2011a, 19). Thus, being a social individual is not equivalent to being\na human being. Further, Witt takes personhood to be defined in terms\nof intrinsic psychological states of self-awareness and\nself-consciousness. However, social individuality is defined in terms\nof the extrinsic feature of occupying a social position, which depends\nfor its existence on a social world. So, the two are not equivalent:\npersonhood is essentially about intrinsic features and could exist\nwithout a social world, whereas social individuality is essentially\nabout extrinsic features that could not exist without a social\nworld.\n\nWitt\u2019s gender essentialist argument crucially pertains to\nsocial individuals, not to persons or human beings: saying\nthat persons or human beings are gendered would be a category mistake.\nBut why is gender essential to social individuals? For Witt, social\nindividuals are those who occupy positions in social reality. Further,\n\u201csocial positions have norms or social roles associated with\nthem; a social role is what an individual who occupies a given social\nposition is responsive to and evaluable under\u201d (Witt 2011a, 59).\nHowever, qua social individuals, we occupy multiple social\npositions at once and over time: we can be women, mothers, immigrants,\nsisters, academics, wives, community organisers and team-sport coaches\nsynchronically and diachronically. Now, the issue for Witt is what\nunifies these positions so that a social individual is\nconstituted. After all, a bundle of social position occupancies does\nnot make for an individual (just as a bundle of properties like\nbeing white, cube-shaped and sweet do not\nmake for a sugar cube). For Witt, this unifying role is undertaken by\ngender (being a woman or a man): it is\n\na pervasive and fundamental social position that unifies and\ndetermines all other social positions both synchronically and\ndiachronically. It unifies them not physically, but by providing a\nprinciple of normative unity. (2011a, 19\u201320)\n\n\nBy \u2018normative unity\u2019, Witt means the following: given our\nsocial roles and social position occupancies, we are responsive to\nvarious sets of social norms. These norms are \u201ccomplex patterns\nof behaviour and practices that constitute what one ought to do in a\nsituation given one\u2019s social position(s) and one\u2019s social\ncontext\u201d (Witt 2011a, 82). The sets of norms can conflict: the\nnorms of motherhood can (and do) conflict with the norms of being an\nacademic philosopher. However, in order for this conflict to exist,\nthe norms must be binding on a single social individual.\nWitt, then, asks: what explains the existence and unity of the social\nindividual who is subject to conflicting social norms? The answer is\ngender.\n\nGender is not just a social role that unifies social individuals. Witt\ntakes it to be the social role \u2014 as she puts it, it is\nthe mega social role that unifies social agents. First,\ngender is a mega social role if it satisfies two conditions (and Witt\nclaims that it does): (1) if it provides the principle of synchronic\nand diachronic unity of social individuals, and (2) if it inflects and\ndefines a broad range of other social roles. Gender satisfies the\nfirst in usually being a life-long social position: a social\nindividual persists just as long as their gendered social position\npersists. Further, Witt maintains, trans people are not\ncounterexamples to this claim: transitioning entails that the old\nsocial individual has ceased to exist and a new one has come into\nbeing. And this is consistent with the same person persisting and\nundergoing social individual change via transitioning. Gender\nsatisfies the second condition too. It inflects other social roles,\nlike being a parent or a professional. The expectations attached to\nthese social roles differ depending on the agent\u2019s gender, since\ngender imposes different social norms to govern the execution of the\nfurther social roles. Now, gender \u2014 as opposed to some other\nsocial category, like race \u2014 is not just a mega social role; it\nis the unifying mega social role. Cross-cultural and trans-historical\nconsiderations support this view. Witt claims that patriarchy is a\nsocial universal (2011a, 98). By contrast, racial categorisation\nvaries historically and cross-culturally, and racial oppression is not\na universal feature of human cultures. Thus, gender has a better claim\nto being the social role that is uniessential to social individuals.\nThis account of gender essentialism not only explains social\nagents\u2019 connectedness to their gender, but it also provides a\nhelpful way to conceive of women\u2019s agency \u2014 something that\nis central to feminist politics.\n4.2.3 Gender as positionality\n\nLinda Alcoff holds that feminism faces an identity crisis: the\ncategory of women is feminism\u2019s starting point, but various\ncritiques about gender have fragmented the category and it is not\nclear how feminists should understand what it is to be a woman (2006,\nchapter 5). In response, Alcoff develops an account of gender as\npositionality whereby \u201cgender is, among other things, a\nposition one occupies and from which one can act politically\u201d\n(2006, 148). In particular, she takes one\u2019s social position to\nfoster the development of specifically gendered identities (or\nself-conceptions): \u201cThe very subjectivity (or subjective\nexperience of being a woman) and the very identity of women are\nconstituted by women\u2019s position\u201d (Alcoff 2006, 148).\nAlcoff holds that there is an objective basis for distinguishing\nindividuals on the grounds of (actual or expected) reproductive\nroles:\n\nWomen and men are differentiated by virtue of their different\nrelationship of possibility to biological reproduction, with\nbiological reproduction referring to conceiving, giving birth, and\nbreast-feeding, involving one\u2019s body. (Alcoff 2006, 172,\nitalics in original)\n\n\nThe thought is that those standardly classified as biologically\nfemale, although they may not actually be able to reproduce, will\nencounter \u201ca different set of practices, expectations, and\nfeelings in regard to reproduction\u201d than those standardly\nclassified as male (Alcoff 2006, 172). Further, this differential\nrelation to the possibility of reproduction is used as the basis for\nmany cultural and social phenomena that position women and men: it can\nbe\n\nthe basis of a variety of social segregations, it can engender the\ndevelopment of differential forms of embodiment experienced throughout\nlife, and it can generate a wide variety of affective responses, from\npride, delight, shame, guilt, regret, or great relief from having\nsuccessfully avoided reproduction. (Alcoff 2006, 172)\n\n\nReproduction, then, is an objective basis for distinguishing\nindividuals that takes on a cultural dimension in that it positions\nwomen and men differently: depending on the kind of body one has,\none\u2019s lived experience will differ. And this fosters the\nconstruction of gendered social identities: one\u2019s role in\nreproduction helps configure how one is socially positioned and this\nconditions the development of specifically gendered social\nidentities.\n\nSince women are socially positioned in various different contexts,\n\u201cthere is no gender essence all women share\u201d (Alcoff 2006,\n147\u20138). Nonetheless, Alcoff acknowledges that her account is\nakin to the original 1960s sex/gender distinction insofar as sex\ndifference (understood in terms of the objective division of\nreproductive labour) provides the foundation for certain cultural\narrangements (the development of a gendered social identity). But,\nwith the benefit of hindsight\n\nwe can see that maintaining a distinction between the objective\ncategory of sexed identity and the varied and culturally contingent\npractices of gender does not presume an absolute distinction of the\nold-fashioned sort between culture and a reified nature. (Alcoff 2006,\n175)\n\n\nThat is, her view avoids the implausible claim that sex is exclusively\nto do with nature and gender with culture. Rather, the distinction on\nthe basis of reproductive possibilities shapes and is shaped by the\nsorts of cultural and social phenomena (like varieties of social\nsegregation) these possibilities gives rise to. For instance,\ntechnological interventions can alter sex differences illustrating\nthat this is the case (Alcoff 2006, 175). Women\u2019s specifically\ngendered social identities that are constituted by their context\ndependent positions, then, provide the starting point for feminist\npolitics.\n5. Beyond the Binary\n\nRecently Robin Dembroff (2020) has argued that existing metaphysical\naccounts of gender fail to address non-binary gender identities. This\ngenerates two concerns. First, metaphysical accounts of gender (like\nthe ones outlined in previous sections) are insufficient for capturing\nthose who reject binary gender categorisation where people are either\nmen or women. In so doing, these accounts are not satisfying as\nexplanations of gender understood in a more expansive sense that goes\nbeyond the binary. Second, the failure to understand non-binary gender\nidentities contributes to a form of\n epistemic injustice\n called \u2018hermeneutical injustice\u2019: it feeds into a\ncollective failure to comprehend and analyse concepts and practices\nthat undergird non-binary classification schemes, thereby impeding on\none\u2019s ability to fully understand themselves. To overcome these\nproblems, Dembroff suggests an account of genderqueer that they call\n\u2018critical gender kind\u2019:\n\na kind whose members collectively destabilize one or more elements of\ndominant gender ideology. Genderqueer, on my proposed model, is a\ncategory whose members collectively destabilize the binary axis, or\nthe idea that the only possible genders are the exclusive and\nexhaustive kinds men and women. (2020, 2)\n\n\nNote that Dembroff\u2019s position is not to be confused with\n\u2018gender critical feminist\u2019 positions like those noted\nabove, which are critical of the prevalent feminist focus on gender,\nas opposed to sex, kinds. Dembroff understands genderqueer as a gender\nkind, but one that is critical of dominant binary understandings of\ngender.\n\nDembroff identifies two modes of destabilising the gender binary:\nprincipled and existential. Principled destabilising \u201cstems from\nor otherwise expresses individuals\u2019 social or political\ncommitments regarding gender norms, practices, and structures\u201d,\nwhile existential destabilising \u201cstems from or otherwise\nexpresses individuals\u2019 felt or desired gender roles, embodiment,\nand/or categorization\u201d (2020, 13). These modes are not mutually\nexclusive, and they can help us understand the difference between\nallies and members of genderqueer kinds: \u201cWhile both resist\ndominant gender ideology, members of [genderqueer] kinds resist (at\nleast in part) due to felt or desired gender categorization that\ndeviates from dominant expectations, norms, and assumptions\u201d\n(2020, 14). These modes of destabilisation also enable us to formulate\nan understanding of non-critical gender kinds that binary\nunderstandings of women and men\u2019s kinds exemplify. Dembroff\ndefines these kinds as follows:\n\nFor a given kind X, X is a non-critical gender\nkind relative to a given society iff X\u2019s members\ncollectively restabilize one or more elements of the dominant gender\nideology in that society. (2020, 14)\n\n\nDembroff\u2019s understanding of critical and non-critical gender\nkinds importantly makes gender kind membership something more and\nother than a mere psychological phenomenon. To engage in collectively\ndestabilising or restabilising dominant gender normativity and\nideology, we need more than mere attitudes or mental states \u2013\nresisting or maintaining such normativity requires action as well. In\nso doing, Dembroff puts their position forward as an alternative to\ntwo existing internalist positions about gender. First, to Jennifer\nMcKitrick\u2019s (2015) view whereby gender is dispositional: in a\ncontext where someone is disposed to behave in ways that would be\ntaken by others to be indicative of (e.g.) womanhood, the person has a\nwoman\u2019s gender identity. Second, to Jenkin\u2019s (2016, 2018)\nposition that takes an individual\u2019s gender identity to be\ndependent on which gender-specific norms the person experiences as\nbeing relevant to them. On this view, someone is a woman if the person\nexperiences norms associated with women to be relevant to the person\nin the particular social context that they are in. Neither of these\npositions well-captures non-binary identities, Dembroff argues, which\nmotivates the account of genderqueer identities as critical gender\nkinds.\n\nAs Dembroff acknowledges, substantive philosophical work on non-binary\ngender identities is still developing. However, it is important to\nnote that analytic philosophers are beginning to engage in gender\nmetaphysics that goes beyond the binary.\n6. Conclusion\n\nThis entry first looked at feminist objections to biological\ndeterminism and the claim that gender is socially constructed. Next,\nit examined feminist critiques of prevalent understandings of gender\nand sex, and the distinction itself. In response to these concerns,\nthe entry looked at how a unified women\u2019s category could be\narticulated for feminist political purposes. This illustrated that\ngender metaphysics \u2014 or what it is to be a woman or a\nman or a genderqueer person \u2014 is still very much a live issue.\nAnd although contemporary feminist philosophical debates have\nquestioned some of the tenets and details of the original 1960s\nsex/gender distinction, most still hold onto the view that gender is\nabout social factors and that it is (in some sense) distinct\nfrom biological sex. The jury is still out on what the best, the most\nuseful, or (even) the correct definition of gender is.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alcoff, L., 1988, \u201cCultural Feminism Versus\nPost-Structuralism: The Identity Crisis in Feminist Theory\u201d,\n<em>Signs</em>, 13: 405\u2013436.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2006, <em>Visible Identities</em>, Oxford:\nOxford University Press.", "Andler, M., 2017, \u201cGender Identity and Exclusion: A Reply to\nJenkins\u201d, <em>Ethics</em>, 127: 883\u2013895.", "\u00c1sta (Sveinsd\u00f3ttir), 2011, \u201cThe Metaphysics of\nSex and Gender\u201d, in <em>Feminist Metaphysics</em>, C.
