    "main_text": "The Affects || The Variety of Affects\n2.2 The Variety of Affects\n\n\nPerhaps the psychological view that Spinoza introduces at IIIp28 is\nsusceptible to the sort of objection which one might raise against\npsychological hedonism, the view that human beings only desire\npleasure, the avoidance of pain, and what is instrumental to these\nthings. It may seem to some people that IIIp28 is not consistent with\ntheir own experience of their motives in acting. So, someone with a\nstrong sense of justice might say: \nIt\u2019s not that I like Jones or would get any joy from having\nhim walk. I think the guy\u2019s a jerk, and I hate to think of him out on\nthe street. But I want him to be released from prison. He simply did\nnot do what he\u2019s been convicted of, so he should be set\nfree.\n\n\nOn the basis of introspective observations like this one, one might\ncomplain that, even if Spinoza\u2019s account of the affects can be shown\nto be consistent with the general theory of striving as it is\npresented at IIIp6, still the theory of affects is not itself a\nrealistically complex account of human desire, since it cannot account\nfor desires like this one in which, on the face of it, one anticipates\nsadness in the desired end. The plausibility of Spinoza\u2019s view depends\nupon the extent to which it can reasonably redescribe this desire, and\nother similarly troubling desires, in ways which are consistent with\nIIIp28.\n\n\nSpinoza attempts to show that there are many varieties of joy, sadness,\nand desire. Thus he might attempt to address the complaint by showing\nthat its author offers a slightly inaccurate description of the\nsituation:\nThe author denies liking Jones. Let us suppose even that\nhe hates Jones. Even so, that does not mean that the author\nanticipates no joy at all in Jones\u2019s release. Knowing that his\nsociety is just in at least this one case may reassure the author\ninasmuch as it gives him reason to think that he might be fairly\ntreated himself. That is, it might be a kind of hope (IIIp18s2) which\nmotivates the desire. Or perhaps there are people the author likes,\nhis fellow citizens generally perhaps, to whom he wishes a similar\npeace of mind. The author may want the release in order to find a kind\nof joy, whether it be out of his ambition to please them or simply out\nof his human kindness (IIIp29s) or nobility (IIIp59s), in the\nwell-being of these other people.\n\n\nFar from insisting that there is one particular kind of emotion that\nmoves people, Spinoza writes that there is an innumerable variety of\naffects:\nIII Proposition 56: There are as many species of Joy,\nSadness and Desire, and consequently of each affect composed of these\n(like vacillation of mind) or derived from them (like love, hate, hope,\nfear, etc.), as there are objects by which we are\naffected.\n\n\nIIIp51 assures us, moreover, that the same object might affect\ndifferent people, or even the same person at different times, in\ndifferent ways. So Spinoza protects himself from the charge that IIIp28\nis obviously false (albeit at the risk of forwarding an unfalsifiable\npsychological claim) by arguing that, despite the seeming simplicity of\nthat proposition, it cannot be falsified by the great variety of\nconscious human motives.\n\n\nAlthough Spinoza repeatedly insists that the variety of affects is\ninnumerable, he nevertheless does characterize, in his own terms, many\nof the traditional passions, each of which is a kind of joy,\nsadness, or desire. A few of Spinoza\u2019s\nparticular accounts are notable.\n\nPity (commiseratio) is for Spinoza a species\nof sadness, sadness that arises from injury to another (IIIp22s), and\nso to feel pity, on Spinoza\u2019s view is to experience a decrease in\none\u2019s own power to persevere in being. If continued perseverance in\nbeing is what virtuous agents seek, then, Spinoza will be committed to\nthe view that pity is not a virtue. Indeed, Spinoza writes at IVp50c,\n\u201cA man who lives according to the dictates of reason, strives, as far\nas he can, not to be touched by pity.\u201d So Spinoza stands apart from\ntraditional Christian views on this subject (and also on the subjects\nof humility and repentance), and with Hobbes who conceives of pity in\nLeviathan VI as a kind of grief and so a decreasing of human\nperfection. This revisionary tendency in his thought is tempered,\nhowever, by IIIp54, where he presents pity, and also the other\ntraditional Christian virtues of humility and repentance, as, if not\ngenuine virtues themselves, at least means to virtue, by which people\nare made more able to come to learn to follow the dictates of\nreason.\n\nSelf-esteem (acquiescentia in se ipso) which\nSpinoza introduces at IIIp30 as Joy accompanied by the idea of oneself\nas an internal cause becomes an important part of Spinoza\u2019s ethical\ntheory, a species of which is even blessedness (beatitudo,\nsee IV, App. 4), the highest form of human happiness. Human beings, as\nfinite modes, cannot on Spinoza\u2019s view avoid affecting and being\naffected by external objects. Nevertheless, Spinoza\u2019s emphasis on\nself-esteem and, in his ethical theory, on self-knowledge suggests\nthat to the extent that we are able to bring about effects, including our\nown emotions, as whole or adequate causes of those effects we are more free and\nbetter off. His remarks concerning the impossibility of controlling\nthe passions and the desirability of controlling them nevertheless to\nthe extent that we can (V Preface) similarly emphasize the ethical\nimportance of self-knowledge and freedom from external influences.\n\nFear (metus) and wonder (admiratio), together with the theory of the imitation of affects, are notions that are fundamental to Spinoza\u2019s accounts of human society. Reasonable citizens (or all citizens insofar as they are reasonable) will willingly obey the rules of the state (IVp37s2, IVp73). Fear, in the Ethics, seems to be government\u2019s most valuable means of bringing passionate citizens to cooperate and obey: at IVp37s2, Spinoza suggests that states should rely on threats. In the Theological Political Treatise, however, Spinoza\u2019s accounts of religion, and particularly of miracles and scripture, suggest that devotion devotio, a passion associated with wonder at Ethics IIIp52s, is a better political motive than fear. In Chapter 5, for example, Spinoza writes of Moses\u2019s introduction of religion into the Hebrew state:\nTwo things in particular forced this on him: the stubborn mentality of the people (because it would not allow itself to be compelled solely by force) and the threat of war. For if war is to go well, it is better to encourage the soldiers than to frighten them with penalties and threats. In this way they will be eager to distinguish themselves for excellence and nobility of spirit rather than merely to avoid punishment.\n\n\nThe theory of the imitation of affects informs these and other accounts of social dynamics in Spinoza. Human beings tend, he argues, to imitate the affects of those that we take to be similar to ourselves (IIIp27), and we tend, when we feel a given affect toward a person whom we take to differ from us, to feel that same affect toward that person\u2019s whole class or nation (IIIp46). Spinoza grounds these doctrines on a series of claims about our associative tendencies at Ethics IIIpp14\u201324. \n\n\nFinally, active joy and active desire\nwhich Spinoza introduces at IIIp58 represent a separate class of\naffects notable both for their novelty against the background of\ntraditional accounts of the passions and also for their importance to\nSpinoza\u2019s ethical arguments of Parts IV and V. On traditional accounts\nof the passions, even Descartes\u2019s (The Passions of the Soul,\nI.1), actions and passions are the same thing, regarded from different\nperspectives: when A does X to B, X is an action for A but a passion\nfor B. For Spinoza, however, anything which follows in a person where\nthat person is an \u201cinadequate\u201d or partial cause of the thing, is a\npassion, and anything that follows where a person is an \u201cadequate\u201d or\ntotal cause of the thing is an action. Thus Spinoza\u2019s class of active\naffects places a strong emphasis on people\u2019s roles as total causes of\nwhat they do; because it becomes for Spinoza ethically important that a\nperson be active rather than passive, that emphasis raises a host of\nquestions about the extent to which a person, a particular thing\ninteracting constantly with other things and indeed requiring some of\nthem for sustenance, can come to resist passion and guide himself by\nmeans of joy and the active desires. \n\n\nBecause joy and sadness as introduced at IIIp11s are passions, all\nof the desires arising from them or species of them are passive as\nwell, that is, they are not desires which arise from a person\u2019s\nstriving alone but only as a partial cause in combination with other,\nultimately external causes. Active joy, which must include at least\nsome types of warranted self-esteem, and active desires, among which\nSpinoza lists at IIIp59s tenacity (animositas) and nobility\n(generositas), are wholly active however; that is, they are\nemotions and desires that people have only insofar as they are adequate\ncauses, or genuine actors. (Notice that sadness cannot ever be an\nactive emotion. People cannot, insofar as they are active bring it\nabout that their power of acting is decreased, so passive sadness,\nunlike passive joy and desire, has no active counterpart.)\n\n\nOf these active affects, the most important for an interpretation of\nSpinoza\u2019s ethics and political philosophy is likely\nnobility. Spinoza\u2019s predominant egoism, together with some of his\nstill stronger statements of psychological egoism such as that at I\nAppendix, suggest that individuals are not, or are not often,\naltruistic. Moreover, his ethics, with its emphasis on self-esteem and\nself-knowledge appears in ways to be an individualistic one: the good,\nwhen I attain it, is a perfection of myself, not of society or the\nworld. However, Spinoza does offer an argument (IVp37) for the view\nthat any good that I want for myself I will have reason to want for\nothers as well, and, in the Ethics, this argument forms the\nbasis of morality and the state (IVp37s1 and s2, respectively). This\nis also a theme of the opening sections of the Treatise on the\nEmendation of the Intellect (see, especially, Spinoza (1), II/8\n23-II/9 3). Nobility is the active affect most closely related to\nSpinoza\u2019s views about morality and the state.  As Spinoza defines it,\nit is a wholly active desire to join others in friendship and to aid\nthem. It helps to supply, in Spinoza theory of the affects, a basis\nfor the view that aiding others is virtuous and rational.\n\nFurther reading: Recent interpretations of\nSpinoza\u2019s theory of consciousness include Miller 2007, Garrett 2008,\nNadler 2008, LeBuffe 2010c, and Marshall 2014.
