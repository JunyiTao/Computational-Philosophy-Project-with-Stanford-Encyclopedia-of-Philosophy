It is so not only because of the multiplicity of approaches\nand dimensions from which meaning can be studied but also due to the\nfact the theoretical landscape is changing swiftly and dynamically.\nFirst, there is the dimension of the ongoing debates concerning the\ndelimitation of explicit content (e.g., Jaszczolt 2009a, 2016a).\nSecond, discussions about \u2018defaultness\u2019 are propelled by\nthe debates concerning the literal/nonliteral vis-\u00e0-vis\nsalient/nonsalient distinction (e.g., Giora & Givoni 2015; Ariel\n2016). Next, defaultness plays an important role in computational\nlinguistics that develops statistical models for learning\ncompositional meaning using \u2018big data\u2019 (Jurafsky &\nMartin 2017 [Other Internet Resources]; Liang & Potts 2015). More\nrecently, the ongoing \u2018revolution\u2019 in philosophy of\nlanguage noticeable in the progressing departure from analytic\nphilosophy has brought in the debates on socially expected, or\nsocially and politically correct \u2013 and as such, standard, or\ndefault \u2013 meanings in the context of discussions on epistemic\nnorms for assertion (e.g., Goldberg 2011, 2015), theories of\nargumentation (e.g., Macagno 2022), and, relatedly, commitment and\naccountability for one\u2019s linguistic actions (e.g., Haugh 2013;\nBorg 2019). Defaults are also relevant in the discussions of the\nconventional import of lexical items such as expressives in that their\nstandard expressive (often offensive) meaning may not arise in certain\ntypes of context; the view on their truth-evaluability (or at least on\nwhat aspects of their meaning are truth-evaluable) is then closely\nrelated to the value one attaches to this context-dependence (Potts\n2007, 2012; Richard 2008; Geurts 2007).\n\nAll in all, the term \u2018default meaning\u2019 has been used in a\nvariety of ways in the literature, including statistically common\ninterpretation, predictable meaning, salient meaning, or automatically\nretrieved meaning. To begin with a common-sense definition, default\ninterpretation of the speaker\u2019s utterance is normally understood\nto mean salient meaning intended by the speaker, or presumed by the\naddressee to have been intended, and recovered (a) without the help of\ninference from the speaker\u2019s intentions or (b) without any\nconscious inferential process whatsoever. Default interpretations,\ninterpretations producing the standard content, are defined\ndifferently depending on how \u2018default\u2019 is defined: as a\ndefault for the lexical item, a default for the syntactic structure, a\ndefault for a particular construction, or even a default for a\nparticular context (where, in addition, there is a necessary\ncorrelation with the adopted definition of \u2018context\u2019). The\ndelimitation of such defaults can proceed according to different\nmethods that, again, can affect the results, and as such further\ncontribute to the definition of defaults. For example, the\npsychological route is associated with automatic, inference-free\ninterpretations, while the statistical route appeals to quantitative\nanalyses of data, where the latter can pertain to corpora of\nconversations or big databases of word co-occurrence as used in\nstatistical, distributional approaches in computational semantics.\n\nIn what follows, I attend to such seminal conceptualisations of\ndefaultness, their provenance, and their relative merits (Sections\n1\u20133). Section 4 follows with some remarks on what can be called\n\u2018dynamic defaultness\u2019 in the theories and models of a\njoint construction (\u2018co-construction\u2019) of meaning that are\nsteadily gaining ground across different strands of pragmatic research\n(Lewis 1979; Asher and Lascarides 2013; Elder and Haugh 2018). Next, I\nbriefly move to the role of defaults on the crossroads of philosophy\nof language with disciplines such as ethics, epistemology, and law\n(Section 5).\n\nThe overview of the major perspectives and debates makes it clear that\nthere is no consensus in the literature as to the unique set of\nproperties that default interpretations should exhibit, opening up the\ndiscussion as to whether the term has only an intra-theoretic utility.\nNext, of course, comes the question of the utility of the\nterm and the utility of the concept \u2013\nsomething I touch upon in the concluding section in the context of\nconceptual engineering.\n", "toc": [{"#DefaInteSemaPrag": "1.

Default Interpretations in Semantics and Pragmatics\n1.1 Defaults, the Said, and the Unsaid\n\nIn post-Gricean pragmatics it has been accepted that communicators\nconvey more information than is contained in the expressions they\nutter. For example, sentences (1a)\u2013(2a) normally convey\n(1b)\u2013(2b).\n\n(1a) Tom finished writing a paper and went skating.\n(1b) Tom finished writing a paper and then went skating.\n(2a) Picasso\u2019s painting is of a crying woman.\n(2b) The painting executed by Picasso is of a crying woman.\n\nSuch additions to the content of the uttered sentence were called by\nGrice (1975) generalized conversational implicatures (GCIs),\nthat is, instances of context-independent pragmatic inference.\nSubsequently, the status of such context-independent additions has\nbecome the subject of heated debates. Some post-Griceans stay close to\nGrice\u2019s spirit and propose that there are salient, unmarked,\npresumed meanings that occur independently of context (Horn, e.g.,\n2004, 2012; Levinson 1995, 2000; Recanati 2004). Some identify default\nmeanings as those arising automatically in a given situation of\ndiscourse (Jaszczolt, e.g., 2005, 2010, 2016b; Elder & Jaszczolt\n2016). Others reject defaults tout court and subsume such\nsalient meanings under a rather broad category of context-dependent\npragmatic inference (Sperber & Wilson 1986; Carston 2002).\n\nNext, some, following Grice, consider such pragmatic contributions to\nutterance meaning to be generalized conversational implicatures\n(Levinson), others classify them as pragmatic input to what is said,\nalbeit using a variety of theory-specific labels (Recanati, Carston),\nreserving the term \u2018implicature\u2019 for meanings that can be\nrepresented by a separate logical form and that function independently\nfrom the content of the main utterance in reasoning. Others define\nthem as contributions to primary meanings where the latter cut across\nthe explicit/implicit divide (Jaszczolt). Yet another possibility is\nto regard them as a separate level of what is implicit in what is said\n(Bach 1994, 2007; Horn 2006). In short, the status of such\n\u2018default\u2019 meanings is still far from clear. However, at\nleast in general terms, there is a reason for drawing a distinction\nbetween salient, automatic enrichments and costly pragmatic inference\nsince some of these pragmatic contributions go through\nnormally, unnoticed, as a matter of course. As Horn (2004:\n4\u20135) puts it,\n\nWhatever the theoretical status of the distinction, it is apparent\nthat some implicatures are induced only in a special context\n(\u2026), while others go through unless a special context\nis present \u2026.\n\nIn the above, the differences in using the term \u2018default\u2019\nconsist of the acceptance or rejection of at least the following\nproperties:\n\ncancellability (also known as defeasibility) of preferred\ninterpretations;\navailability of preferred interpretations without making use of\nconscious inference;\nshorter time required for their formation by the speaker and\nrecognition by the addressee as compared with that required for the\nmeanings induced through inference;\nthe availability of preferred interpretations prior to the\ncompletion of the processing of the entire proposition (local,\npre-propositional defaults).\n\n\nWhen analysed in standard truth-conditional semantics, defaults can\ncontribute to the truth-conditional content or affect what is implicit\n\u2013 presupposed or implicated (see e.g., Potts 2015). The side on\nwhich we find defaults in this distinction is largely dictated by the\norientation concerning the semantics/pragmatics boundary, where the\nchoice ranges from traditional semantic minimalism to radical versions\nof contextualism. I discuss these in more detail in the following\nsections. But it has to be remembered that the category is tangential\nto such concepts as what is said, conversational implicature,\nconventional implicature, presupposition, or, to use a more general\nterm, projective content (on universals in projective content see\nTonhauser et al. 2013). For example, presuppositions are\nstronger than defaults: presupposition triggers such as\n\u2018know\u2019, \u2018regret\u2019, \u2018again\u2019 or\n\u2018manage\u2019 do not give the hearer much option of\ninterpretation, save admitting some form of metalinguistic or\nquotative reading when these are negated as in (3).\n\n(3) I didn\u2019t forget about your birthday again; it is\n    the first time it happened.\n\nWhat is said can rely on various types of defaults (Section 2) and\ncontextually salient interpretations (Section 3), but likewise it can\nrely on effortful pragmatic inference from a variety of sources\navailable in the situation of discourse. Relevant implicatures can be\nconventional (Grice 1975; Potts 2005) and conversational generalised,\nthe latter understood either as grammar-driven (Chierchia 2004) or,\nmore loosely, language-system-driven (Levinson 2000 and Section 1.3),\nbut implicatures can also be entirely context-dependent\n(particularised). To add to this multi-dimensionality,\ncontext-dependent implicatures can on some occasions arise\nautomatically, so when our definition of defaults relies on the\ndefinitional criterion of the automaticity of the process, as\ndiscussed above, then, by this definition, such implicatures can also\nbe dubbed \u2018defaults\u2019 (Giora & Givoni 2015; Jaszczolt\n2016a). In short, pursuing the standard route of analysing the types\nof content will not get us far with analysing defaults.\nSaid/implicated, at-issue, or question-under-discussion-driven\nanalyses (e.g., Roberts 2004) will encounter defaults on either side of\nthe pertinent dichotomies.\n\nA further complication in linking defaultness with the categories of\nthe said or the unsaid is the fact that even weak implicatures or\npresuppositions adopted through accommodation can enjoy either status.\nIn (4), we can accommodate globally the presupposition in (5) \u2013\neither via inference or automatically.\n\n(4) Tom says that Ian hasn\u2019t finished writing a novel.\n(5) Ian is writing a novel.\n\nAs a result, (5) can enjoy the default status according to some of the\nstandard understandings of defaults as automatic, or more frequent,\nmore salient, or even more \u2018literal\u2019 interpretations, or,\nalternatively, it can simply be an interpretation that is easier to\nprocess \u2013 arguably, in itself a plausible criterion for\n\u2018defaultness\u2019.\n\nNext, conventional implicatures, that is lexical meanings that,\naccording to Grice (1975), do not contribute to what is said, have, at\nfirst glance, less to do with defaultness: they are entrenched,\nnon-cancellable and form-dependent (detachable), and they cannot be\ncalculated from maxims, principles or heuristics (Horn 1988: 123).\nHowever, more recent inquiries into the related category of\nexpressives gives more scope for pursuing defaultness. Slurs are,\narguably, offensive by default but their derogatory import does not\ncarry across to context of banter and camaraderie. As to whether the\nexpressive content is an implicature or part of what is said, the\nmatter is still hotly discussed (see e.g., Richard 2008; Sileo 2017).\nIn what follows, I try to bring some order into this unwieldy term\nvis-\u00e0-vis the semantics/pragmatics distinction and finish with\nsome reflections on its usefulness for semantics and pragmatics.\n1.2 Default Reasoning\n\nBe that as it may, default meanings come from default reasoning.\nAccording to Kent Bach (1984), in utterance interpretation we use\n\u2018jumping to conclusions\u2019, or \u2018default\nreasoning\u2019. In other words, speakers know when context-dependent\ninference from the content of the sentence is required and when it is\nnot. When it is not required, they progress, unconsciously, to the\nfirst available and unchallenged alternative. This step is cancellable\nwhen it becomes obvious to the addressee that the resulting meaning is\nnot what the speaker had intended. What is important in this view is\nthe proposed distinction between (conscious) inference and the\nunconscious act of \u2018taking a step\u2019, as Bach (1984: 40)\ncalls it, towards the enriched, default interpretation. Such a move to\nthe default meaning is not preceded by a conscious act of deliberation\nas to whether this meaning was indeed intended by the speaker. Rather,\nit just goes through unless it is stopped by some contextual or other\nfactors that render it implausible.\n\nBach founds his account on the Gricean theory of intentional\ncommunication and therefore he has a ready explanation for the fact\nthat different meanings come with different salience. He makes an\nassumption that intentions allow for different degrees of strength\n(Bach 1987). He also adds that salience has a lot to do with\nstandardisation (Bach 1995; 1998) which consists of interpreting an\nutterance according to a pattern that is established by previous usage\nand as such short-circuits the process of (conscious) inference. In\nshort, \u2018jumping to conclusions\u2019 is performed unconsciously\nand effortlessly.\n\nFor Bach, such default meanings are neither implicatures nor what is\nsaid (or explicatures): they are implicit in what is said, or\nimplicitures. They are a result of \u2018fleshing out\u2019\nthe meaning of the sentence in order to arrive at the intended\nproposition, or \u2018filling in\u2019 some conceptual gaps in the\nsemantic representation that, only after this filling in, becomes a\nfull proposition. An example of \u2018fleshing out\u2019 is given in\n(6b), where the minimal proposition is expanded. \u2018Filling\nin\u2019 is exemplified in (7b), where a so-called propositional\nradical is completed.\n\n(6a)Tom is too young.\n(6b)Tom is too young to drive a car.\n(7a)Everybody likes philosophy.\n(7b)Everybody who reads the SEP likes philosophy.\n\n\nBut default meanings do not exhaust the category membership of the\nimpliciture: implicitures can be a result of default reasoning as well\nas a context-dependent process of inference. Analogous to the\ndistinctions discussed before, default meanings are orthogonal to the\ndistinction between what is said, impliciture, and implicature: the\ndefault/inferential distinction cuts across all three.\n1.3 Presumptive Meanings and Cancellability\n\nStephen Levinson (1995, 2000) argues for default interpretations that\nhe calls presumptive meanings and classifies as implicatures.\nHe uses the term borrowed from Grice, generalized conversational\nimplicatures (GCIs), but ascribes some properties to them that\ndifferentiate them from Grice\u2019s GCIs. For Levinson, GCIs are\nneither properly semantic nor properly pragmatic. They should not be\nregarded as part of semantics as, for example, in Discourse\nRepresentation Theory (Kamp and Reyle 1993), nor should they be seen\nas a result of context-dependent inference performed by the hearer in\nthe process of the recovery of the speaker\u2019s intention. Instead,\n\u201cthey sit midway, systematically influencing grammar and\nsemantics on the one hand and speaker-meaning on the other.\u201d\n(Levinson 2000: 25).\n\nSuch presumed meanings are the result of rational, communicative\nbehaviour and arise through three assumed heuristics: (1) \u2018What\nisn\u2019t said, isn\u2019t\u2019; (2) \u2018What is expressed\nsimply is stereotypically exemplified\u2019, and (3)\n\u2018What\u2019s said in an abnormal way isn\u2019t normal\u2019,\ncalled Q, I, and M heuristics (principles) respectively.\nLevinson\u2019s GCIs, unlike their Gricean progenitors, can arise at\nvarious stages in utterance processing: the hearer need not have\nprocessed the whole proposition before arriving at some presumed\nmeanings. Also, unlike Grice\u2019s GCIs that are taken to be\nspeaker\u2019s intended meanings, Levinson\u2019s presumptive\nmeanings seem to be hearer\u2019s meanings, obtained by the\nhearer as a result of the assumptions he or she made in the process of\nutterance interpretation (see Saul 2002 and Horn 2006 for discussion).\nOn the other hand, like Grice\u2019s GCIs, they are cancellable\nwithout contradiction.\n\nNow, when defaults are delimited by contextual salience, arguably,\ncancellation may not occur except for cases of miscommunication. In\nother words, when the meaning is salient in a given context, it is\nlikely that it had been meant by the speaker unless the speaker\nmisjudged the common ground. But when they are understood as\nlanguage-system-driven meanings, \u00e0 la Levinson\u2019s GCIs,\ncancellability constitutes direct evidence of such defaultness.\nSalient components of meaning added to the overtly expressed content\n(in the form of additional information or choices of interpretation)\ntend to be entrenched and as such difficult to cancel. But as\nJaszczolt (2009a, 2016a) demonstrates, cancellability is a property\nthat does not side with implicit as opposed to explicit content but\nrather with salience. If the main intended message is communicated\nindirectly, as in (8b), then it is the implicature (8c) that is\ndifficult to cancel.\n\n(8)(Fred and Wilma talking about Wilma\u2019s piano recital)\n(8a)Fred: Was the recital a success?\n(8b)Wilma: Lots of people left before the end.\n(8c)The recital was not a success.\n\nThe presence or absence of cancellation in utterance interpretation is\nstill a matter of dispute. It is difficult at present to decide\nbetween the rival views (i) that a particular GCI arose and was\nsubsequently cancelled or (ii) that it did not arise at all due to\nbeing blocked by the context. There is not sufficient experimental\nevidence to support either stance. The answer to this question is\nclosely dependent on the answer to the so-called globalism-localism\ndispute. If, as Levinson claims, default interpretations arise\n\u2018locally\u2019, out of the processing of a pre-propositional\nunit such as a word or a phrase, then they have to be subjected to\nfrequent cancellation once the proposition has been processed. If,\nhowever, despite the incrementality of the interpretation process they\narise post-propositionally, or \u2018globally\u2019, in accordance\nwith Grice\u2019s original assumption, then utterance interpretation\ncan proceed without costly backtracking (see Geurts 2009; Jaszczolt\n2008, 2009a, 2016a; Noveck & Sperber 2004).\n1.4 Rhetorical Structure Rules\n\nGricean pragmatics is not the only approach in which defaults are\ndiscussed. Defaults and nonmonotonic reasoning are also well\nentrenched in\n computational linguistics.\n Defaults are distinguished there with respect to various units of\nmeaning, from morphemes and words to multisentential units (Asher\n& Lascarides 1995; Lascarides & Copestake 1998). In this\nsection I focus on intersentential default links and in the next I\nplace \u2018glue logic\u2019 in the context of some other\nunderstandings of defaults in computational semantics.\n\nThe tradition of defaults in nonmonotonic reasoning can be traced back\nto Humboldt, Jespersen and Cassirer, and more recently to\nReiter\u2019s (1980) default logic and his default rules of the\nform:\n\nA:B\n\nC\n\nwhere C can be concluded if A has been concluded and\nB can be assumed (and not B cannot be proven). Such\ndefaults can be built into standard logic:\n\nIt is just as valid to conclude \u2018Presumably x is\nB\u2019 from \u2018x is A\u2019 and\n\u2018A\u2019s are normally B\u2019 as it is to\nconclude \u2018x is B\u2019 from \u2018x\nis A\u2019 and the \u2018All A\u2019s are\nB\u2019. One does not have to set one\u2019s mind to a\ndifferent mode of reasoning to get the former. Veltman (1996: 257).\n\n\nBut the resulting logic will become nonmonotonic because there are\ndefault rules and default operators in the language. The literature on\nthe topic is vast and is best considered as a separate topic from our\ncurrent concern (see e.g., Thomason (1997) for an overview).\n\nA good example of how default interpretations can be accounted for in\nformal semantic theory is Segmented Discourse Representation Theory\n(SDRT, e.g., Asher & Lascarides 2003). SDRT is an offshoot of\nDiscourse Representation Theory, a dynamic semantic approach to\nmeaning according to which meaning arises incrementally through\ncontext change. In SDRT, defaults are regarded as highly probable\nroutes that an interpretation of a sentence may take in a particular\nsituation of discourse. There are rules of discourse, so-called\nrhetorical structure rules, that produce such default\ninterpretations. These rules spell out the overall assumption that\ndiscourse is coherent and that this coherence can be further\nelaborated on by proposing a set of regularities. For example, two\nevents represented as two consecutive utterances are presumed to stand\nin the relation of Narration, where the event described in\nthe first utterance precedes the one from the second utterance. If the\nsecond utterance describes a state, then it stands in the relation of\nBackground to the first one. There are many other types of\nsuch relations, among them Explanation and Elaboration. Axioms prevent\na relation from being of two incompatible types at the same time. The\nrelations between states and events are computed as strong\nprobabilities, in the process called defeasible reasoning. The laws of\nreasoning are \u2018defeasible\u2019 in the sense that if the\nantecedent of a default rule is satisfied, then its consequent is\nnormally, but not always, satisfied. The inference normally,\nbut not always, obtains: ceteris paribus, the relation\npredicted by the law obtains, but in certain circumstances it may not.\nIt is also nonmonotonic in that the relation may disappear with the\ngrowth of information.\n\nSDRT includes the following components: (i) the semantics of sentences\nalone, that is the underspecified output of the syntactic processing\nof the sentences; (ii) the semantics of information content, that is,\nfurther addition to these underdetermined meanings, including default\nadditions summarised by rhetorical structure rules; and (iii) the\nsemantics of information packaging that \u2018glues\u2019 such\nenriched representations by means of the rules of the rhetorical\nstructure of discourse. This \u2018gluing together\u2019 is\ndefeasible, in that the rules result in the dependency\nA>B, that is \u2018if A, then normally\nB\u2019, where A and B stand for the\nenriched propositional representations of two sentences. In other\nwords, they stand for the meanings of two consecutive utterances.\n\nThe main strength of this approach is that it is fully formalized and\nit allows for computational modelling of discourse that takes\npragmatic links between utterances seriously and incorporates them in\nthe semantics. Next, it also aspires to cognitive reality and although\nthe cognitive reality of the particular rules can be disputed, the\nview of discourse processing that they jointly produce is highly\nplausible. Finally, as the authors often stress, SDRT allows them, for\nmost part, to model discourse without recourse to speakers\u2019\nintentions. However, a direct comparison with Gricean accounts of\ndefaults is precluded by the fact that we would not be comparing like\nwith like. In SDRT, the default interpretations are the defaults that\nare formalized with respect to the actually occurring discourse: there\nare rules that tell us how to take two events represented in two\nconsecutive sentences, there are also rules that specify the relation\nbetween them depending on some features of their content. Gricean\ndefaults are, on the contrary, defaults for speakers\u2019 overall\nknowledge state: they may arise because the speaker did not\nsay something he or she could have said or because the\nspeaker assumed some cultural or social information to be shared\nknowledge. For example, we cannot formalize the interpretation of (9a)\nas (9b) by means of rhetorical structure rules. The interpretation of\n(9a) as (9b) fits under the SDRT component (ii) rather than (iii)\nabove, i.e., the semantics of information content rather than\npackaging.\n\n(9a)Pablo\u2019s painting is of a crying woman.\n(9b)Picasso\u2019s painting is of a crying woman.\n\nFinally, it has to be mentioned that the discourse relations that for\nAsher and Lascarides belong to the \u2018glue logic\u2019 can\nalternatively be conceived of as part of the grammar proper: Lepore\n& Stone (2015), for example, incorporate conventions into\nminimalistically understood, grammar-driven semantics, and a fortiori\ninto grammar proper; following Lewis\u2019s (1979) ideas on\nconvention and \u2018scorekeeping\u2019, they propose that\n\u201csemantics describes interlocutors\u2019 social competence in\ncoordinating on the conversational record\u201d (Lepore & Stone\n2015: 256). Merits of putting conventions into grammar are, however,\nnot easy to find (for a review see Jaszczolt 2016b).\n1.5 Computational Semantics Landscape\n\nThe computational semantics landscape contains a few landmarks in\nwhich the concept of a default figures prominently, albeit under\ndifferent labels. I have already discussed the role of defaults and\ninheritance reasoning in artificial intelligence research in the\nexample of SDRT. This kind of research in computational linguistics is\narguably the closest to theoretical linguistic semantics and\npragmatics in that it directly appeals to human practices in\nreasoning. Pelletier & Elio (2005) refer to this characteristic as\nthe psychologism of nonmonotonic logics, and thus a property that was\nso fiercely banished from logic by Frege as a form of a\n\u2018corrupting intrusion\u2019, in that \u2018being true\nis quite different from being held as true\u2019 (Frege\n1893: 202). Pelletier and Elio write:\n\nUnlike most other reasoning formalisms, nonmonotonic or default\nreasoning, including inheritance reasoning, is\n\u201cpsychologistic\u201d \u2013 that is, it is defined only as\nwhat people do in circumstances where they are engaged in\n\u201ccommonsense reasoning\u201d. It follows from this that such\nfundamental issues as \u201cwhat are the good nonmonotonic\ninferences?\u201d or \u201cwhat counts as \u2018relevance\u2019 to\na default rule?\u201d, etc., are only discoverable by looking at\npeople and how they behave. It is not a formal\nexercise to be discovered by looking at mathematical systems, nor is\nit to be decided by such formal considerations as\n\u201csimplicity\u201d or \u201ccomputability\u201d, etc.\nPelletier & Elio (2005: 30).\n\n\nOther landmarks include research on default feature specification in\nsyntactic theory and default lexical inheritance (e.g., Gazdar et\nal. 1985; Boguraev & Pustejovsky 1990; Lascarides et al.\n1996), where default inheritance comes from a simple idea pertaining\nto all taxonomies: regular features belonging to an entity of a\ncertain type are inherited from the categories higher up in the\ntaxonomic hierarchy, that is simply by virtue of the membership of a\ncertain ontological type. As a result, only the non-default features\nhave to be attended to (on various semantic networks in computational\nlinguistics see also Stone 2016). To generalize, this line of research\ncan lead to incorporation of information into logical forms,\nincluding, as can be seen in the example of SDRT, dynamic logical\nforms of discourses. In a different camp there are statistical,\ndistributional approaches to meaning where meaning is derived from\ninformation about co-occurrence of items gleaned from corpora and then\nquantitatively analysed. This orientation gave rise to current\nvector-based approaches (see, e.g., Jurafsky & Martin 2017 [Other\nInternet Resources]; Coecke et al. 2010 and for discussion\nLiang & Potts 2015). Vector semantics exploits the finding that\ndates back at least to Harris (1954) and Firth (1957) that the meaning\nof a word can be computed from the distribution of the words in its\nimmediate context. The term \u2018vector semantics\u2019 derives\nfrom the representation of the quantitative values in this\ndistribution called a \u2018vector\u2019, where the latter is\ndefined as a distributional model that presents information in the\nform of a co-occurrence matrix. Vectors have been around since the\n1950s but it is only recently that such distributional methods have\nbeen combined with logic-based approaches to meaning (see Liang &\nPotts 2015). Vectors can measure the similarity of texts with respect\nto a lexical item, the similarity of lexical items with respect to\nsources, or, what interests us most, the co-occurrence of selected\nwords in a selection of contexts (using additional methods to rule out\nco-occurrence by chance). In distributional semantics therefore the\nsalient or default meaning is the meaning given by the observed high\nco-occurrence or, in other words, delimited by the high conditional\nprobability of its occurrence in the context of other words.\n\nCurrent compositional semantics is beginning to combine compositional\nsemantic theory (logic-based approaches discussed above) with\nstatistical models, conforming to the standard view of\ncompositionality on which complex meanings are a function of lexical\nmeanings and the mode of combination, arrived at through a recursive\nprocess, but at the same time aiming at capturing the generalization\nfrom (finite) past experiences that would inform machine learning.\nDefaults arise in this context in several different forms: (i) as\nshortcuts to standard meanings of more semantically predictable\ncategories, that is, closed-class words such as determiners, pronouns\nor sentential connectives. (This can be extended perhaps to types of\npredictable projective content such as various types of implicature or\npresupposition; see Tonhauser et al. 2013); (ii) as\npredictable cross-sentential discourse relations; (iii) as predictable\ndiscourse-anaphoric links; (iv) as meaning arising from frequent\nsyntagmatic associations; (v) as meaning arising from frequent\nconversational scenarios, to name a few salient concepts. In this new,\npositively eclectic orientation in computational linguistics that\ncombines logical and statistical approaches, the label\n\u2018default\u2019 is likely to lead to more confusion than utility\nin that it can pertain to either of the two contributing orientations.\nOn the other hand, if the findings lead to the same set of what we can\ncall \u2018shortcuts through possible interpretations\u2019, the\nconfusion may be of merely a methodological rather than ontological\nimportance.\n1.6 Defaults in Optimality-Theory Pragmatics\n\nOptimality-Theory pragmatics (OT pragmatics, Blutner 2000; Blutner and\nZeevat 2004; ) is another attempt at a computational modelling of\ndiscourse but unlike SDRT it makes use of a post-Gricean,\nintention-based account of discourse interpretation. The process of\ninterpretation is captured in a set of pragmatic constraints. The\npragmatic additions to the underdetermined output of syntax are\ngoverned by a rationality principle called an optimization procedure\nthat is spelled out as a series of constraints. These constraints are\nranked as to their strength and they are defeasible, that is, they can\nbe violated (see Zeevat 2000, 2004). The resulting interpretation of\nan utterance is the outcome of the working of such constraints. OT\npragmatics formalizes and extends the Gricean principles of\ncooperative communicative behaviour as found in Horn (1984) and\nLevinson (1995, 2000). For example, STRENGTH means preference for\nreadings that are informationally stronger, CONSISTENCY means\npreference for interpretations that do not conflict with the extant\ncontext, FAITH-INT stands for \u2018faithful interpretation\u2019,\nthat is interpreting the utterance without leaving out any aspect of\nwhat the speaker says. The ordering of these constraints is FAITH-INT,\nCONSISTENCY, STRENGTH. The interaction of such constraints, founded on\nLevinson\u2019s heuristics, explains how the hearer arrives at the\nintended interpretation. At the same time, this model can be regarded\nas producing default, presumed interpretations. With respect to\nfinding an antecedent for an anaphor, for example, the interaction of\nthe constraints explains the general tendency to look for the referent\nin the immediately preceding discourse rather than in the more remote\nfragments or, rather than constructing a referent ad hoc. In\nother words, it explains the preference for binding over accommodation\n(van der Sandt 1992, 2012).\n\nDefaults in OT pragmatics combine the precision of a formal account\nwith the psychological reality of Gricean intention-based\nexplanations. The main difference is that they don\u2019t seem to be\ndefeasible: OT pragmatics tells us how an actual interpretation arose,\nrather than what the default interpretation could be. Constraints are\nranked, so to speak, post hoc: they explain what actually\nhappened and why, rather than what should happen according to the\nrules of rational communicative behaviour. In other words, context is\nincorporated even sooner into the process of utterance interpretation\nthan in Gricean accounts and allows for non-defeasible, albeit\nstandard, default, interpretations. With respect to this feature they\nresemble defaults of Default Semantics discussed in Section 1.8.\n1.7 Defaults in Truth-Conditional Pragmatics\n\nIn truth-conditional pragmatics (Recanati, e.g., 2004, 2010), the\nmeaning of an utterance consists of the output of syntactic processing\ncombined with the output of pragmatic processing. Pragmatic\nprocessing, however, is not necessarily fulfilled by conscious\ninference: processes that enrich the output of syntax are\nsub-doxastic, direct, and automatic. The resulting representation of\nutterance meaning is the only representation that has cognitive\nreality and it is subject to truth-conditional analysis. On this\naccount, the content of an utterance is arrived at directly, similar\nto the act of perception of an object. Recanati calls this view\nanti-inferentialist in that \u201ccommunication is as direct as\nperception\u201d (Recanati 2002: 109): the processing of the\nspeaker\u2019s intentions is (at least normally) direct, automatic,\nand unreflective. Such processes enriching the actually uttered\ncontent are called primary pragmatic processes. Some of them make use\nof contextual information, others are context-independent. So, they\ninclude some cases of Grice\u2019s GCIs as well as some\nparticularised implicatures (PCIs; on implied content see also\nTonhauser et al. 2013) \u2013 but only the ones which\nfurther develop the logical form of the uttered sentence. When the\npragmatic addition constitutes a separate thought, it is, on this\naccount, an implicature proper, arrived at through a secondary,\nconscious, and reflective pragmatic process.\n\nThere are two kinds of enrichment of the content obtained through the\nsyntactic processing: (i) completing of a semantically incomplete\nproposition as in (10b), called saturation, and (ii) further\nelaboration of the meaning of the sentence that is not guided by any\nsyntactic or conceptual gaps but instead is merely triggered by the\nhearer\u2019s opinion that something other than the bare meaning of\nthe sentence was intended, as in (11b). The latter process is called\nfree enrichment.\n\n(10a)The fence isn\u2019t strong enough.\n(10b)The fence isn\u2019t strong enough to withstand the gales.\n(11a)John hasn\u2019t eaten.\n(11b)John hasn\u2019t eaten dinner yet.\n\nDefault interpretations are here defaults for processing of an\nutterance in a particular context. Automatic and unconscious\nenrichment produces a default interpretation of the utterance and\n\u201c[o]nly when there is something wrong does the hearer suspend or\ninhibit the automatic transition which characterizes the normal cases\nof linguistic communication\u201d. (Recanati 2002: 109). To sum up,\nsuch defaults ensue automatically, directly, without the effort of\ninference. They are cancellable, they can make use of contextual\nclues, but they are not \u2018processes\u2019 in any cognitively\ninteresting sense of the term: they don\u2019t involve conscious\ninference, albeit, in Recanati\u2019s terminology, they involve\ninference in the broad sense: the agent is not aware of performing an\ninference but is aware of the consequences of this pragmatic\nenrichment of the interpreted sentence.\n1.8 Types of Defaults in Default Semantics\n\nOne of the main questions to ask about any theory of utterance\ninterpretation is what sources information about meaning comes from.\nIn Default Semantics, (Jaszczolt, e.g., 2009, 2010, 2016a, 2021),\nutterance meaning is the outcome of merging of information that comes\nfrom five sources: (i) word meaning and sentence structure (WS); (ii)\nsituation of discourse (SD); (iii) properties of human inferential\nsystem (IS); (iv) stereotypes and presumptions about society and\nculture (SC); and world knowledge (WK). WS is the output of the\nsyntactic processing of the sentence, or its logical form. SD stands\nfor the broadly understood context in which the discourse is immersed.\nIS pertains to properties of mental states which trigger certain types\nof interpretations. For example, the property of intentionality\nensures that we normally use referring expressions with a referential\nintention that is the strongest for the given context. SC pertains to\nthe background knowledge of societal norms and customs and cultural\nheritage. WK encompasses information about physical laws, nature,\nenvironment, etc. It is important to stress that the four sources that\naccompany WS do not merely enrich the output of the latter. All of the\nsources are equally powerful and can override each other\u2019s\noutput. This constitutes a substantial breakaway from the established\nboundary between explicit and implicit content.\n\nThe identification of the sources also allows us to propose a\nprocessing model in Default Semantics in which three types of\ncontribution to utterance interpretation are distinguished: (i)\nprocessing of the sentence (called combination of word meaning and\nsentence structure, WS); (ii) conscious pragmatic inference (CPI) from\nthree of the sources distinguished above: SD, SC, and WK; and (iii)\ntwo kinds of default, automatic meanings: cognitive defaults (CD)\ntriggered by the source IS, and social, cultural and world-knowledge\ndefaults (SCWD).\n\nThe primary meaning is arrived at through the interaction of these\nprocesses and therefore need not bear close resemblance to the logical\nform of the sentence; the output of WS can vary in significance as\ncompared with the output of other types of processes. For example, to\nborrow Bach\u2019s (1994) scenario, let us imagine little Johnny\ncutting his finger and crying, to which his mother reacts by uttering\n(12a).\n\n(12a)You are not going to die.\n\nThe what is said/explicature of (12a) is something to the\neffect of (12b). There may also be other communicated meanings but\nthose fall in the domain of implicatures.\n\n(12b)You are not going to die from this cut.\n\nIn Default Semantics, the primary content of an utterance is its most\nsalient meaning. This is so even when this meaning does not bear any\nresemblance to the logical form derived from the syntactic structure\nof the uttered sentence. In other words, CPI can override WS and\nproduce, say, (12c) as utterance meaning (called  primary\nmeaning, represented in a merger representation) for the\ngiven context. The explicit content of the utterance need not be even\npartially isomorphic with the meaning of the uttered sentence: it need\nnot amount to the development of the sentence\u2019s logical\nform.\n\n(12c)There is nothing to worry about.\n\nCDs and SCWDs are default interpretations. Similar to Recanati\u2019s\nautomatic free enrichment, these default meanings cut across\nGrice\u2019s GCI/PCI divide. Some of them arise due to the properties\nof words or constructions used and are present by default\nindependently of the context of the utterance, while others are\ndefault meanings for the particular situation of discourse. CDs are\ndefault interpretations that are triggered by the properties of mental\nstates. For example, when speakers use a definite description in an\nutterance, they normally use it referentially (about a particular,\nknown, intersubjectively recognisable individual) rather than\nattributively (about whoever fits the description). This default\nreferential use can be given a functional as well as a cognitive\nexplanation. Firstly, it can be explained in terms of the strength of\nthe referential intention associated with the act of utterance:\nceteris paribus, humans provide the strongest information relevant and\navailable to them. At the same time, in cognitive terms, it can be\nexplained through the property of mental states that underlie the\nspeaker\u2019s speech act: this is the property of\nintentionality or aboutness, in the sense in which\nthe mental state is about a particular object, be it a person, thing,\nor situation. Like the strongest referring, so the strongest\naboutness, is the norm, the default. For example, the description\n\u2018the architect who designed St Paul\u2019s cathedral\u2019 in\n(13a) is likely to be interpreted as \u2018Christopher Wren\u2019,\nas in (13b).\n\n(13a)The architect who designed St Paul\u2019s cathedral was a\n    genius.\n(13b)Sir Christopher Wren was a genius.\n\nNext, SCWDs are default interpretations that arise due to the shared\ncultural and social background of the interlocutors. To use a well\nworn example, in (14a), it is the shared presumption that babies are\nraised by their own mothers that allows the addressee to arrive at\n(14b).\n\n(14a)The baby cried and the mother picked it up.\n(14b)The baby cried and the baby\u2019s mother picked it up.\n\nIn CDs and SCWDs, no conscious inference is involved. The natural\nconcomitant of reducing the role of the logical form (WS) to one of\nfour equally potent constituents of utterance meaning is a revised\nview of compositionality. The compositional nature of meaning is\nretained as a methodological assumption but this compositionality is\nnow sought at the level of the merger of information from the five\nsources, arrived at through the interaction of the four identified\nprocesses. The output of these processes is called merger\nrepresentation and is expected to be a compositional structure.\nCurrent research focuses of providing an algorithm for the interaction\nof the output of the identified processes.\n2. Definitional Characteristics of Default Interpretations\n\nIt is evident from the sample of approaches presented above that the\nnotion of default meaning is used slightly differently in each of\nthem. We can extract the following differences in the understanding of\ndefault interpretations:\n\n[1a] Defaults belong to competence.\n\nvs.\n\n[1b] Defaults belong to performance.\n\n[2a] Defaults are context-independent.\n\nvs.\n\n[2b] Defaults can make use of contextual information.\n\n[3a] Defaults are easily defeasible.\n\nvs.\n\n[3b] Defaults are not normally defeasible.\n\n[4a] Defaults are a result of subdoxastic, automatic process.\n\nvs.\n\n[4b] Defaults can involve conscious pragmatic inference.\n\n[5a] Defaults are developments of the logical form of the uttered\nsentence.\n\nvs.\n\n[5b] Defaults need not enrich the logical form of the sentence but may\noverride it (which is orthogonal to the question as to whether\ndefaults have to be literal meanings)\n\n[6a] Defaults can all be classified as one type of pragmatic process.\n\nvs.\n\n[6b] Defaults come from qualitatively different sources in utterance\nprocessing.\n\nThere is also disagreement concerning the following properties, to be\ndiscussed below:\n\n[7a] Defaults are always based on a complete proposition.\n\nvs.\n\n[7b] Defaults can be \u2018local\u2019,\n\u2018sub-propositional\u2019, based on a word or a phrase.\n\n[8a] Defaults necessarily arise more quickly than non-default\nmeanings. Hence they can be tested for experimentally by measuring the\ntime of processing of the utterance.\n\nvs.\n\n[8b] Defaults do not necessarily arise more quickly than non-default\nmeanings because both types of meaning can be based on conscious,\neffortful inference. Hence, the existence of defaults cannot be tested\nexperimentally by measuring the time of processing of the\nutterance.\n\nThe \u2018whose meaning\u2019 question also give rise to\ncontroversies, such as those discussed in Section 4:\n\n[9a] Default meanings are static: they are intended, or recovered, or\n(normally) both.\n\nvs.\n\n[9b] Default meanings are dynamic, interactional, and as such are the\nresult of the joint construction of meaning in conversation.\n\nQuestions on the boundary of linguistics and ethics, linguistics and\nepistemology, or linguistics and law (to name a few) also give rise to\nrival positions, such as:\n\n[10a] Speakers are accountable only for the minimal semantic content\nof their utterances.\n\nvs.\n\n[10b] Speakers are accountable for standard, default (in one of the\nabove senses) interpretations or their utterances.\n\nThis may lead to more specific controversies, such as:\n\n[10a\u2032] What counts as a lie or an insult pertains to default (in\none of the above senses) content.\n\nvs.\n\n[10b\u2032] What counts as a lie or an insult pertains to minimal\nsemantic content.\n\nThese are addressed in Section 5.\n\n[1]\u2013[8] are the most standardly accepted characteristics of\ndefault interpretations in theoretical semantics and pragmatics. We\nshall not include here definitional characteristics of defaults in\ncomputational linguistics as these are a subject for a separate study.\nSome of the properties in [1]\u2013[8] are interrelated, some of the\nothers just tend to occur together. Levinson\u2019s presumptive\nmeanings, for example, are defeasible, i.e., fulfil [3a], local [7b],\npertain to competence [1a], and are faster to process than inferential\nmeanings [8a]. They are competence defaults of the type [1a] because\nthey arise independently of the situation of discourse and are\ntriggered by the construction alone, due to the presumed default\nscenario that it pertains to. For example, scalar inference from\n\u2018many\u2019 to \u2018not all\u2019 is a case of a\ncompetence-based, context-independent, local default. Similarly, the\nrhetorical structure rules of SDRT give rise to competence defaults.\n(15b) is a result of the common, shared knowledge that pushing\nnormally results in falling.\n\n(15a)You pushed me and I fell.\n(15b)You pushed me and as a result I fell.\n\nAs regards feature 7, it is at least conceivable that presumed\nmeanings arise as soon as the triggering word or construction has been\nprocessed by the hearer. For Levinson (1995, 2000), salient meanings\nhave this property of arising even before the processing of the\nsentence is completed but can subsequently be cancelled if further\ncontext witnesses against them.. In other words, they arise\npre-propositionally or locally. Discourse\ninterpretation proceeds incrementally and similarly the assignment of\ndefault meanings to the processed segments is incremental. For\nexample, the scalar term many in (16a) triggers the presumed\nmeaning not all as soon as it has been processed. The\nsubscript d in (16b) stands for the default meaning and is\nplaced immediately after the triggering construction.\n\n(16a)Many people liked Peter Carey\u2019s new novel.\n(16b)Many (d many but not all) people liked Peter\n    Carey\u2019s new novel.\n\nSimilarly, \u2018paper cup\u2019 and \u2018tea cup\u2019 give rise\nto presumed meanings locally, as in (17b) and (18b) respectively.\n\n(17a)Those paper cups are not suitable for hot drinks.\n(17b)Those paper cups (d cups made of paper) are not\n    suitable for hot drinks.\n(18a)I want three tea cups, three saucers and three spoons please.\n(18b)I want three tea cups (d cups used for drinking tea),\n    three saucers and three spoons please.\n\nInferences such as those in (17b) and (18b) are very common. They are,\nhowever, substantially different from the inference in (16b) in that\nthe resulting meaning is the lexical meaning of the collocation,\nsimilar to that of a compound. Other examples include \u2018pocket\nknife\u2019 vs. e.g., \u2018bread knife\u2019, and \u2018coffee\nspoon\u2019 vs. e.g., \u2018silver spoon\u2019. It is worth\nremembering that on Levinson\u2019s account, presumed, salient\ninterpretations can be explained through the principles of rational\ncommunicative behaviour summed up as his Q, I and M heuristics (see\nSection 1.2 and Levinson 1995, 2000). (16b) arises through the\nQ-heuristic, \u2018What isn\u2019t said isn\u2019t\u2019, while\n(17b) and (18b) arise through the I-heuristic, \u2018What is\nexpressed simply is stereotypically exemplified\u2019. Most\ngenerally, the defaults that arise through the Q-heuristic exploit a\ncomparison with what was not, but might have been, said. For example,\n\u2018most\u2019 triggers an inference to a denial of a stronger\nitem \u2018all\u2019; \u2018believe\u2019 triggers an inference to\n\u2018not know\u2019. At the same time, they are all easily\ncancellable, as (16c) illustrates.\n\n(16c)Many, and possibly all, people liked Peter Carey\u2019s new\n    novel.\n\nI-heuristic exploits only what there is in the sentence: it is an\ninference to a stereotype and as such is not so easily cancellable.\nFor example, (19) and (20) seem rather bizarre.\n\n(19)Those paper cups, I mean cups used for storing paper, are full.\n(20)I want three tea cups, I mean cups used for storing tea\n    leaves.\n\nPerhaps the fact that these defaults are not so easily cancellable\ncomes from their property of resembling lexical compounds and, like in\nthe case of compounds, the link between the juxtaposed lexemes is very\nstrong in their case. If indeed it is plausible to treat them on a par\nwith compounds, then they are not very useful as a supporting argument\nfor local defaults: instead of defaults, we have lexical meaning of\ncompounds.\n\nLocal defaults allow us to dispose of the level of an underspecified\npropositional representation in semantic theory. Since the inferences\nproceed incrementally, then as soon as the triggering expression is\nencountered, there is no level of a minimal proposition that would\nconstitute a foundation for further inferences. If there is one, it is\njust accidental, in that the triggering item may just happen to be\nplaced at the end of the sentence, for example \u2018tea cups\u2019\nin the first clause of (20) above. But it is also important to note\nthat the status of such defaults is still far from clear. For example,\nLevinson\u2019s defaults are local, but at the same time\n\u2018cancellable\u2019 to the extent that the context may prevent\nthem from arising. This leads to a difficulty in examples such as\n(21)\u2013(22).\n\n(21)You are allowed five attempts to get the prize.\n(22)You are allowed to do five minutes of piano practice today\n    because it is late.\n\nIt is clear that in (21) \u2018five\u2019 is to be understood as\n\u2018at most five\u2019. How are we to model the process of\nutterance interpretation for this case? Are we to propose that the\ninference from \u2018at least five\u2019 to \u2018exactly\nfive\u2019 takes place and is then cancelled? Or are we to propose\nthat \u2018five\u2019 is by default \u2018at least five\u2019 (or\nunderdetermined five, or \u2018exactly five\u2019, depending on the\norientation (see Horn 1992; Koenig 1993; Bultinck 2005) and becomes\naltered in the process of pragmatic inference to \u2018at most\nfive\u2019 in the context of \u2018allow\u2019? But then,\n\u2018allow\u2019 is also present in (22) and the inference to\n\u2018at most\u2019 is not at all salient: doing a longer piano\npractice is generally preferred but may not be what the addressee\nlikes doing and \u2018five\u2019 may end up, in this context, to\nmean \u2018as little as five\u2019 or \u2018five or more\u2019,\nstressing that more than five is not expected but allowed. In (23),\nthe problem is even more salient. If \u2018five\u2019 triggers\nlocally the \u2018exactly\u2019 meaning, then the default has to be\ncancelled immediately afterwards when \u2018are needed\u2019 has\nbeen processed and the \u2018at least\u2019 interpretation becomes\nobvious.\n\n(23)Five votes are needed to pass the proposal.\n\nAlternatively, we can stipulate that the first inference takes place\nafter the word \u2018needed\u2019. It is clear that a lot needs to\nbe done to clarify the notion of local defaults: most importantly, (i)\nwhat counts as the triggering unit, (ii) to what extent context is\nconsulted, and (iii) how common cancellation is. But it seems that if\ndefaults prove to be so local as to arise out of words or even\nmorphemes, then they are part of the computational power of grammar\nand they belong to grammar and lexicon rather than to semantics and\npragmatics. Chierchia (2004) and Landman (2000) represent this view.\nChierchia argues that since scalar implicatures do not arise in\ndownward-entailing contexts (contexts that license inference from a\nset to its subset), there is a clear syntactic constraint on their\nbehaviour (but see Chemla et al. 2011). Jaszczolt (2012)\ncalls such units that give rise to defaults or inferential\nmodification \u2018fluid characters\u2019, employing Kaplan\u2019s\n(1989) content-character distinction, to emphasise the fact that the\nunit of meaning that leads to inference or to a default meaning varies\nfrom context to context and from speaker to speaker: characters are\n\u2018fluid\u2019 because they correspond to \u2018flexible\ninferential bases\u2019 or \u2018flexible default bases\u2019. But\nmuch more theorizing and substantial empirical support are needed to\nestablish the exact size of such local domains and the corresponding\nfluid characters.\n\nAs far as feature [8] is concerned, experimental work helps decide\nbetween [8a] and [8b], measuring the recovery time for the default\nmeaning as opposed to the non-default one. The development of the\nability to use scalar inferences has also been tested (Noveck 2001,\n2018; Papafragou & Musolino 2003; Musolino 2004; Noveck and\nSperber 2004; Geurts 2010; see also contributions to Cummins and\nKatsos 2019 ). It has been argued on the basis of some evidence that\ndefault interpretations are not faster to produce and can be absent\naltogether from processing in the case of five-year old subjects.\nNoveck (2004) provides the following evidence against Levinson\u2019s\nautomatic and fast defaults. Children were presented with some\ndescriptions of situations in which the order of the events was\ninverted in narration. They had to assess whether the description was\ntrue or false. The outcome was that the children who agreed with the\ninverted description reacted faster than the ones who disagreed. It\nwas then concluded that enriching \u2018and\u2019 to \u2018and\nthen\u2019 is not automatic: it takes time. And, if pragmatically\nenriched responses take longer, then they cannot be the default ones\n(see Noveck 2004: 314). Similarly, with scalar terms, if one could\ndemonstrate that the enriched readings, such as \u2018some but not\nall\u2019 for \u2018some\u2019, arise faster than \u2018some but\nnot necessarily not all\u2019, one would have strong evidence in\nsupport of the defaults view.\n\nThe problem is that all these experiments assume Levinson\u2019s\nnotion of a fast and inference-free default while this is, as we have\nseen, by no means the only understanding of default interpretations,\nand, arguably, not even the most commonly assumed one. The\nexperimenters talk of arguments for and against \u2018the Default\nView\u2019, \u2018the Default Model\u2019 (see also Bezuidenhout\nand Morris 2004, Breheny et al 2006), while, in fact there is no such\nunique model to be falsified: there are very different understandings\nof defaultness even in post-Gricean pragmatics alone, as is evident\nfrom Section 1. The list of possible defining characteristics of\ndefault interpretations in [1]\u2013[8] shows that one cannot talk\nabout the default meaning. At the same time, it is much\nharder to provide any experimental evidence for or against salient\nmeaning that draw on some contextual information, arise late in\nutterance processing, and are not normally cancellable. The latter\nalso seem much more intuitively plausible than Levinson\u2019s rigid\ndefaults in that they are simply shortcuts through costly pragmatic\ninference and as such can be triggered by the situation itself rather\nthan by the properties of a lexical item or construction at large.\nThey are just normal, unmarked meanings for the context at hand and it\nis not improbable that such default, salient interpretations will\nprove to constitute just the polar end of a scale of degrees of\ninference rather than have qualitatively different properties from\nnon-default, clearly inference-based interpretations. They will occupy\nthe area towards the \u2018zero\u2019 end of the scale of inference\nbut will not trigger the dichotomy \u2018default vs. inferential\ninterpretation\u2019. But since it is debatable whether salience\nought to be equated with defaultness in he first place, our\nterminological quandary comes back with full strength (see Section\n3).\n\nIt is also difficult to pinpoint the boundary between default and\nnon-default interpretations when we allow context and inference to\nplay a role in default meanings, that is when we allow [2b] and [8b].\nThis does not mean, however, that we should pour them out with the\nbath water and resort to proposing nonce-inference in the case of\nevery single utterance produced in discourse. When context-dependence\nof defaults is allowed, then the main criterion for such meanings is\ntheir subdoxastic arrival. When conscious inference is allowed, then\nthe main criterion is the fact that only minimal contextual input is\nallowed, such as, say, the co-text in (24). In (24), the definite\ndescription \u2018the first daughter\u2019 has the attributive\nrather than referential reading.\n\n(24)The first daughter to be born to Mr and Mrs Brown will be called\n    Scarlett.\n\nOn a traditional Gricean view of post-propositional, sentence-based\npragmatic inference, we have here the default attributive reading: the\nexpression \u2018to be born\u2019 and the future auxiliary\n\u2018will\u2019 signal that no particular, extant, known individual\nis referred to. This is also the view followed in Default Semantics\n(Section 1.8) where both inference and defaults are \u2018assumed to\nbe global\u2019 \u2013 \u2018assumed\u2019 in the sense of a\nmethodological assumption put in place until we have the means to test\nthe actual length of fluid characters and the content of the\ncorresponding default bases. In other words, information arrived at\nthrough WS merges with that from CPI, CD and SCWD when all of\nthe WS is ready. But in Default Semantics there is no default involved\nin (24): we have WS merging with CPI to produce the attributive\nreading. On Levinson\u2019s presumptive meanings account (Section\n1.3), it can be stipulated that (24) would fall in-between GCIs and\nPCIs: the only context that is required is the sentence itself, so the\nexample is not different from any other cases of GCIs. But the\nlocality of the GCI is the problem: depending on how we construct the\nlength of the triggering expression, we obtain a GCI or a PCI. When we\nconstrue it as \u2018the first daughter\u2019, the sub-part of the\ndefinite noun phrase, then we obtain the referential reading as the\ndefault, to be cancelled by \u2018to be born\u2019. In short, we\ndon\u2019t know yet, at the current state of theorizing and\nexperimenting, which of the potential defining characteristics of\ndefaults to employ. Neither are we ready to propose the demarcation\nline between default and non-default interpretations. We can conceive\nof the first as shortcuts through inference but such a definition will\nnot suffice for delimiting a category. We can, however, concede that\ndefault interpretations are governed by principles of rational\nbehaviour in communication, be it Gricean maxims, neo-Gricean\nprinciples or heuristics, the logic of information structuring of\nSDRT, or a version of defeasible logic as presented above.\n\nAll in all, it appears that the diversity of default interpretations\npertains not only to their features listed in [1]\u2013[8] but also\nto their provenance. This diversified use makes the term heavily\ntheory-dependent. Next, we can move to orthogonal, albeit not less\nimportant, discussions of defaults vs. salience and defaults vs.\nliteral meaning.\n3. Defaults, Salience, and Literalness\n\nIn pragmatic theory, the term \u2018default\u2019 is often used in\nassociation with the term \u2018salience\u2019, so it is important\nto clarify the similarities and differences between them. For Giora\n(e.g., 2003; Giora & Givoni 2015), salience and defaultness are two\ndifferent concepts. Salience depends merely on \u2018accessibility in\nmemory due to such factors as frequency of use or experiential\nfamiliarity\u2019 (Giora 2003: 33). For her, salience concerns\nmeanings, while defaultness concerns interpretations:\n\nDefining defaultness in terms of an automatic response to a stimulus\npredicts the superiority of default over non-default counterparts,\nirrespective of the degree of non-salience, figurativeness, context\nstrength\u2026. (Giora & Givoni 2015: 291)\n\n\nSo, salience is here a graded phenomenon (see here Giora 2003 for her\nexperimentally supported Graded Salience Hypothesis). Salience is also\nindependent from the literalness of the interpretation: the highly\naccessible meaning is not always the literal one. According to Giora\n(2003: 33), \u2018literality is not a component of salience\u2019.\nThe latter is caused by experience, frequency of use, and as such is\nreflected in the accessibility in memory. Her experiments demonstrated\nthat \u2018familiar instances of metaphor and irony activated their\nsalient (figurative and literal) meanings initially, regardless of\ncontextual information\u2019 (p. 140).\n\nReconciling defaultness with salience may, however, be problematic in\nparticular cases, leading to the proposal of the degrees of\ndefaultness (Giora & Givoni 2015), and to a rather\ncounterintuitive diluting of the concept of a default. For example,\nsarcasm can rely on non-salient but default interpretation\n\u2013 non-salient when the interpretation is compositionally put\ntogether instead of being processed as a conventionalised unit.\n\nOn the other hand, for Jaszczolt (e.g., 2016a) defaultness relies\nprecisely on salience that leads to automatic meaning retrieval. She\ncalls this view Salience-Based Contextualism: the meaning of an\nutterance is derived through a variety of interacting processes, some\nof which rely on automatic interpretations such as cognitive defaults\nor socio-cultural and world knowledge defaults identified in the\ntheory of Default Semantics and discussed in Section 1.8. Such\ndefaults are defaults for the context and for the speaker, but\nsalience that predicts them is not. According to Salience-Based\nContextualism, words and structures can trigger salient, automatically\nretrieved meanings. This is guaranteed by the fact that language is a\nsocio-cultural as well as a cognitive phenomenon and as such is shaped\nby its common use in discourse on the one hand, and by the structure\nand operations of the brain on the other (see Jaszczolt 2016a: 50).\nSalience is situation-free (although not always co-text free \u2013\nsee above on fluid characters), defaultness is not: it is easy to\nimagine a speaker who does not make use of the available salient\ninterpretation because he or she lacks the necessary sociocultural\nbackground, knowledge of the laws of physics, or is guided by the\ncontext towards a different interpretation. Defaultness applies to a\nflexible unit on the basis of which an interpretation is formed (a\nfluid character). Defaults in conversation result from emergent\nintentionality (Haugh 2008, 2011): they rely on the process of\nco-construction of meaning discussed in Section 4. So, conversational\ndefaults subsume salient meanings \u2013 literal or not, such as\nGiora\u2019s salient meanings understood as conventional,\nprototypical, familiar, or frequent.\n\nOne of the important corollaries of this salience-based defaultness is\nthe possible redundancy of the literal/nonliteral distinction. If\nwords exhibit strong influences on each other in a string as well as\ninfluences from the situation of discourse (sometimes called\n\u2018lateral\u2019 and \u2018top-down influences\u2019,\nrespectively \u2013 see e.g., Recanati 2012), then we have little\nreason for postulating literal meaning. For example, in (25), we have\nlittle reason for postulating \u2018literal\u2019 meanings of\n\u2018city\u2019 or \u2018asleep\u2019: either of the words may\naccommodate to fit the other, and the appropriate interpretation will\nfollow.\n\n(25)The city is asleep. (from Recanati 2012: 185).\n\nIf \u2018city\u2019 means \u2018inhabitants of the city\u2019,\n\u2018asleep\u2019 applies to it directly. If it means the place\nwith its infrastructure, \u2018asleep\u2019 has to adjust to mean\nsomething to the effect of \u2018quiet\u2019, \u2018dark\u2019 or\n\u2018showing no movement\u2019. But neither of the processes has a\nclear point of departure: there is no obvious, clearly definable move\nfrom literal to non-literal. Such co-occurrence comes with degrees of\nsalience of certain meanings. Such options can also be viewed as\n\u2018probabilistic meanings\u2019 that are \u2018contextually\naffirmed\u2019, to use Allan\u2019s (2011: 185) terminology, through\nnonmonotonic inferences either in the co-text or by some other factor\nin the common ground.\n\nHowever, probabilistic meanings presuppose ambiguity, while in general\nthe salience- and default-oriented semantics and pragmatics relies on\nthe assumption of underspecification. While in the case of (26)\u2013(27)\nan ambiguity account appears justified when viewed from the\nperspective of the inventory of the lexicon in a language system (in\nthat one would expect an analogy from \u2018leopard\u2019 and\n\u2018fox\u2019 to \u2018lamb\u2019 and \u2018goat\u2019, while\nin the context of the sentence this analogy is not present, as shown\nin (26a) and (27a)), most cases of lexical adjustment cannot be traced\nback to properties of entries in the lexical inventory.\n\n(26)Jacqueline prefers leopard to fox.\n(27)Harry prefers lamb to goat.\n(26a)Jacqueline prefers leopard skin to fox fur.\n(27a)Harry prefers eating lamb to eating goat.\n\n(from Allan 2011: 180). Probabilistic meaning, according to Allan,\nought to be included in the lexicon: a lexeme ought to be listed in\nthe lexicon with different interpretations, annotated for their\nprobability and circumstances in which this meaning is likely to\noccur. He calls such probabilistic meanings \u2018grades of\nsalience\u2019.\n\nIt is evident that this proposal brings us to the territory of\nvector-based semantics in computational linguistics, while, on the\nother hand, accounts based on intention- and context-driven adjustment\nsuch as Recanati\u2019s and Jaszczolt\u2019s pull in the direction\nof post-Gricean pragmatics. But as Sections 1.1\u20131.8 demonstrate, the\ntwo traditions are not necessarily incompatible. Lexical salience and\nradical contextualism about the lexicon point in the same direction as\ndistributional accounts in computational semantics: we have\nprobabilities of certain meanings because these are meanings derived\nfrom the \u2018company a word keeps\u2019, to adapt Firth\u2019s\n(1957: 11) famous dictum. All in all, content words are strongly\ncontext-dependent \u2013 to the extent that perhaps indexicality\nought to be viewed not as a defining feature of some lexical items but\nas a gradable feature of the entire lexicon. But what counts as\nindexicality is a separate theoretical question that cannot be pursued\nhere.\n\nNext, there is one more reason why salience has to be clearly\ndistinguished from defaultness. Let us consider demonstratives. The\nobject referred to by using \u2018that\u2019 can be located with the\nhelp of (i) the recognition of the speaker\u2019s intention, or (ii)\nthe act of pointing, or even (iii) the presence of a particular\nprominent object in the visual field of the interlocutors. All these\ncombine to delimit the concept of salience: such an object has to be\n(made) salient for the linguistic demonstration to succeed. Here\nsalient meaning is entirely, or almost entirely (allowing for\nthe grammatical rendering of e.g., the proximal/distal distinction)\ndetermined by the given context and by the speaker\u2019s knowledge\nthat it is the relevant context (see Lewis 1979 on\nscorekeeping; Cappelen and Dever 2016 for a discussion). What is\nimportant for us here is that salience can be produced by the\nuse of a context-dependent term: objects are brought to salience by\nthe use of an indexical. Salience so understood is still compatible\nwith the situation-independent concept of salience discussed above (to\ndistinguish it from defaultness) in that it is the semantic meaning,\nthe character (Kaplan 1989) of the demonstrative that triggers the\nbringing-to-salience process.\n\nNow, on the one hand, linguistic research informs us that expressions\nwith thin semantic content such as anaphorically used demonstrative\npronouns or personal pronouns are employed for referents whose\ncognitive status is high. In other words, they are used when the\nobject is in focus of attention or at least activated in memory\n(Gundel et al. 1993; see Jaszczolt 2002: 140\u2013149 for a\ndiscussion). On the other hand, when combined with an act of\ndemonstration, the object can be made salient. Cappelen and\nDever (2016) discuss here two types of successful referring by\ndemonstratives: pointing and intending (i.e. (i) and (ii) above),\ncontrasted with prominence (i.e. (iii) above). The first creates\nsalience, while the latter pertains to extant salience; the first\nbrings entities into focus, while the latter exploits their in-focus\ncognitive status. What is of particular interest to semanticists (of\nboth orientations discussed here, Gricean and computational) is that\nthe first type allows for accommodation (Lewis 1979): objects are made\nmore salient when communication requires it.\n\nTo conclude, salience clearly differs from defaultness but for\nexpressions (words, phrases, sentences) for which delimiting default\ninterpretations makes sense, salience can provide an explanans.\n4. Co-construction of Meaning: Towards Dynamic, Interactional Defaults\n\nIt is not a new observation that interlocutors can have collective, or\njoint, intentions in communication. Joint construction of meaning has\nbeen attended to in approaches as different as game theory (Lewis\n1979; Parikh 2010), action theory (Searle 1990) and conversation\nanalysis (Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson 1974). But it is only more\nrecently that the joint construction (or co-construction) of meaning\nhas begun to come to the forefront of pragmatics tout court.\nFor example, Arundale\u2019s so-called Conjoint Co-constituting Model\nof Communication focuses on the interactive construction of\nimplicatures (Arundale 1999, 2010; Haugh 2007, 2008; Haugh and\nJaszczolt 2012). Next, Elder and Haugh (2018) propose a model of\ncomplex inferential work, continuing for several conversational turns,\nthat can account for mismatches between the expected and the actual\ninferences, as well as for the fact that speakers may not have precise\nintentions while issuing an utterance and be open to negotiating\nmeaning. These aspects of communication had often been neglected, or\neven denied, in post-Gricean research.\n\nIt is no surprise that understanding communication as emergent\nmeanings, as negotiating intentions and commitments (see e.g., Geurts\n2019; Elder 2021) is taking the concept of default to the new\nterritory of dynamic, co-constructed meanings. Elder and Haugh, for\nexample, aim at modelling the joint construction of the meaning that\nis settled on by the interlocutors as the main content \u2013 as they\nsay, akin to the \u2018primary meaning\u2019 of Default Semantics\n(Jaszczolt 2005) or to Ariel\u2019s (2002) \u2018privileged\ninteractional interpretation\u2019 \u2013 free from any formal\nconstraints that the logical form of the uttered sentence might\nimpose, but instead, and in addition, flowing freely, as conversation\nprogresses, with dynamic, changing intentions. Such co-constructed\nmeaning is steered by default interpretations that are assigned\nprivately by each side but also sometimes rejected in favour of what\nprogressively emerges as a default inference \u2013 an interactively\nconstructed meaning that is sensitive to what is fit to be taken for\ngranted, and as such sensitive to what other parties would, and do,\ntake for granted. In short, dynamic, interactional pragmatics comes\nwith dynamic, interactional defaults.\n5. Defaults and Accountability\n\nInteractional pragmatics discussed in the previous section highlights\nanother important aspect of communication that was largely neglected\nin early pragmatic theories, namely speaker accountability. Haugh\n(2013: 53) presents it as follows:\n\nFirst, what a speaker is held accountable for goes beyond the veracity\nof information to include other moral concerns, such as social rights,\nobligations, responsibilities and the like. Second, to be held\ninteractionally accountable differs from inferring\ncommitment. The former is tied to an understanding of speaker meaning\nas arising through incremental, sequentially grounded discourse\nprocessing \u2026, while the latter is tied to a punctuated view of\nspeaker meaning that arises at the level of utterance processing.\n\n\nAs he says, it is important to view speaker meaning as a\ndeontological concept \u2013 that is, view it from the\nperspective of moral philosophy and norms of what actions are\npermitted or not permitted in conversation. Viewing speaker meaning as\ndeonotological puts emphasis on practical applications of speech, on\nsuch moral norms and on the consequences of conversational behaviour.\nAnd this is where defaultness comes to the fore, propelled by the\nquestion as to what kind of content speakers ought to be held\naccountable for. Should it be the kind of meaning that speakers feel\ncommitted to, or the kind of meaning that they, sometimes\ninadvertently, communicated? Or, perhaps, merely the minimal semantic\ncontent? Emma Borg (2019), for example, distinguishes between what she\ncalls (i) strict liability, that is liability for the minimal\nproposition pertaining to one\u2019s utterance, delimited according\nto the principles of her Minimal Semantics (Borg 2004, 2012), and (ii)\nconversational liability (a gradable concept), applied to potential\ninterpretations of an utterance in the context of conversation. But\nsuch philosophical solutions don\u2019t go far enough in that they\nmerely offer a more fine-grained classification rather than\nimplementable answers. Next, Elder and Haugh (2018) focus on\n\u2018the most salient propositional meaning that is\nostensively made operative between interlocutors\u2019 (p. 595),\nwhich allows them to offer a proposal with more direct utility for\ndiscussions of moral responsibility. The concept of dynamic, operative\nmeaning allows them to argue that it is the addressee\u2019s response\nthat makes the speaker accountable for the emergent meaning \u2013\nthe meaning that the interlocutors settle for in the next turn when\nthe original speaker becomes aware of their \u2018reflexive\naccountability\u2019. But, again, feasibility of implementation has\nto wait for a model with some predictive power.\n\nAll in all, the concepts of commitment, liability (including legal\nliability) and accountablity are beginning to get to the forefront of\nphilosophy of language, pragmatics, and contextualist semantics (and\nas such, necessarily, also metasemantics and metapragmatics, see\nJaszczolt 2022), and take the concept of defaultness with them to the\nnew dynamic, interactive dimension. The offshoots of those debates are\nample. For example, they open up new perspectives on such questions as\nwhat counts as an assertion, insult, slur, or a lie: what kind of\ncontent ought we to include, and, on the other hand, what norms ought\nwe to adopt? Here are a few snapshots.\n\nSanford Goldberg asks what constitutes the speech act of assertion,\nand what epistemic norm assertion should satisfy. He says that\nassertions are \u201cspeech acts in which a given proposition is\npresented as true, where this presentation has certain\nforce (what we might call assertoric force)\u201d\n(Goldberg 2015: 5) and that \u201c[i]t is mutually manifest to\nparticipants in a speech exchange that assertion has a robustly\nepistemic norm; that is, that one must: assert that p, only if E(one,\n[p])\u201d (p.96), where \u2018E\u2019 stands for a description of\na mutually manifest epistemic standard. But this opens up the question\nas to what counts as asserted content, for linguistic as well as\nsocial, legal, and ethical purposes. Is it merely minimal content?\nBut, perhaps, there is no such thing as minimal content in that here\nare no core meanings, no context-free concepts (cf. Rayo 2013)? Or,\nperhaps, one ought to opt for Levinson-style presumptive meanings\n(Section 1.3), or context-driven defaults (Sections 1.7\u20131.8), or even\ninteractive meanings that emerge thanks to salience and defaultness of\ncertain interpretations (Section 4)? Scope for theorizing and\nexperimentation is still ample.\n\nRelatedly, default meaning is an important concept for the discussion\nof deception, such as lying and misleading. Insincerity has recently\nengendered heated debates in linguistic pragmatics in that it is a\nmoot point what exactly counts as lying. For example, is lying saying\nsomething that the speaker believes to be false? Or is it saying\nsomething with an intention to deceive but the content of which need\nnot necessarily be false (see e.g., Stokke 2018)? And, what exactly\ncounts as \u2018saying\u2019 for the purpose of lying (see e.g Saul\n2012)? Further, can one lie through implicatures and presuppositions\n(Meibauer 2014)? And perhaps we ought to venure even further. As\nHeffer (2020: 6) says, \u201c\u2026we need to extend the\nscope of untruthfulness both from utterance insincerity\n(lying and misleading) to discursive insincerity (withholding), and\nfrom intentional insincerity to epistemic irresponsibility\u201d (see\nalso Carson 2010). Epistemic sincerity is the default in ordinary,\n\u2018non-strategic\u2019 contexts, so, lying, misleading, and\nbullshitting (that is, speaking without regard for truth or falsehood)\ncan easily go through. But here the question as to what exact meaning\nthe speaker is accountable for is intimately related to the question\nof conversational salience and defaults.\n\nNow, it appears that for the debates at a crossroads of theory of\nmeaning and ethics, the crucial understanding of defaultness is that\nof salient emergent meaning in conversation. As we have seen here,\nsuch defaults can be abused \u2013 a topic that is of interest to\npragmatics as well as to theories of argumentation. Let us consider\none more snapshot, this time an example of an argumentative strategy\nof decontextualisation, where instead of inferring the default\ninterpretation (in the sense of the automatic, most salient\ninterpretation for the context), the addressee reacts to the\ndecontextualized semantic content of the speaker\u2019s utterance.\nThis is traditionally called \u2018the fallacy of ignoring\nqualifications\u2019 (secundum quid or secundum quid et\nsimpliciter, loosely translatable as \u2018what is true in a way\nand what is true absolutely\u2019. It is a form of deceit that, as\nMacagno (2022) argues, is best explicated in a broader pragmatic\ncontext of ignoring not only what is explicit but also of what is\nimplicit:\n\nAccording to this view, the secundum quid does not result\nfrom the \u2018suppression\u2019 or \u2018ignoring\u2019 of\nexplicit qualifications or evidence (\u2026); rather, it is\ncommitted when an implicit qualification is reconstructed in a way\nthat was not intended and could not be presumed. (Macagno 2022: 6)\n\n\nAs he says, post-Gricean pragmatic theories are indispensable here for\nexplaining how this form of manipulation works, in that they can\ninvoke principles and heuristics of how the intended meaning is\nrecovered by the addressee. He focuses on contextualist accounts that\ncapture the proposition expressed, or Recanati\u2019s what is said\nand Sperber and Wilson\u2019s explicature. Secundum quid is\nexplained as a strategy of manipulation that makes use of the\npragmatic process of enrichment, but relying not on the\nassumptions shared by the interlocutors but instead substituting\nunwarranted, strategically chosen ones:\n\nThe qualified or absolute interpretations are fallacious because they\nare different from the \u2018default\u2019, \u2018salient\u2019,\nor more generally \u2018plain\u2019 meaning. (Macagno 2022: 7)\n\n\nThe importance of such defaults for argumentation theory requires no\nfurther defence.\n6. Concluding Remarks and Future Prospects\n\nThis comparison of various selected approaches to default\ninterpretations in semantics and pragmatics allows for some\ngeneralizations. Firstly, it is evident from the surveyed literature\nthat, contrary to the assumptions of some experimental pragmaticists,\nthere is no one, unique \u2018default model\u2019 of utterance\ninterpretation. Instead, default (and salient) meanings are recognised\nin many approaches to utterance interpretation but they are defined by\ndifferent sets of characteristic features. Next, in the present state\nof theorizing, data-based analyses and experimenting, while the\nrationale for default interpretations is strong, some of the\nproperties of such interpretations are still in need of further\ninvestigation. For example, the discussions of locality of defaults\nand their subdoxastic arrival are in need of empirical support before\nthey can be taken any further. In other words, a \u2018fluid\ncharacter\u2019 is in need of empirical identification \u2013 and\neven more so when we add the dynamic perspective of interactively\nachieved, co-constructed meanings.\n\nMoreover, the principle and method for delimiting a default\ninterpretation as distinguished from an inferential interpretation is\nstill a task for the future. The existence of a shortcut through\ncostly inference is an appealing and hardly controversial thesis but\nthe exact properties of such meanings are still subject to\ndisputes.\n\nNext, the automatic arrival at context-dependent meanings has to be\ndiscussed as part of the debate between the direct access view and the\nmodular view of language processing. Direct access predicts that\ncontext is responsible for activating relevant senses to the extent\nthat the salience of the particular sense of a lexical item does not\nplay a part. According to the modular view, lexical meanings that are\nnot appropriate for the context are also activated, only to be\nsuppressed at a further stage of processing. With the rise of theories\nthat sit between these polar views, the question of the compatibility\nof the salience in the lexicon and the default status of utterance\ninterpretations requires more attention. What can be attributed to the\nlexicon and what to the context of utterance remains an unresolved\nquestion.\n\nFinally, whether we approach defaults through distributional\ncomputational semantics, theoretical truth-conditional semantics,\npost-Gricean pragmatics, or some version of a combined view, progress\nin research on defaults in human reasoning will necessarily require\nprogress in technology. No matter how powerful our theories are, they\nwill have to be tested either on large corpora, or through\nneuroimaging: more traditional methods of psycholinguistic experiments\nor small databases will always leave a wide margin of doubt as to\n\u2018is it really how human reasoning works\u2019? If there are big\ngeneralizations to be made regarding how we jump to conclusions, these\nwill have to be modern equivalents of the 19th century\nphenomenological ideas, founded on intentionality of mental states,\ninformativeness of acts of communication, all predicted by assumed\nefficiency (but not necessarily cooperation), but with access to\nmodern methods of empirical corroboration (or falsification).\n\nIn this context, can we safely assume that the concept of default\nmeaning will sail with the most successful approaches to human\ncommunication, or is it in need of precisification now, when it is so\ndiversely used (and sometimes misused)? Conceptual engineering is\noften a risky business. But going along with the common-sense use is\nnot so: meanings that \u2018spring to mind\u2019 are default\nmeanings \u2013 it is just that for some purposes we want to talk\nabout meanings and associations that spring to mind in the context\nof a particular discourse, and for others, in the language\nsystem alone. This degree of flexibility, further justified by\ndiverse objectives in employing the concept \u2013 as diverse as,\nsay, making an interlocutor accountable for a strongly conveyed but\n\u2019unsaid\u2019 insult on the one hand, and devising algorithms\nfor training machines to use language to communicate on the other, is\nprobably not so difficult for theorists of meaning to live with.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Allan, K., 2011, \u201cGraded Salience: Probabilistic Meaning in\nthe Lexicon\u201d, in <em>Salience and Defaults in Utterance\nProcessing</em>, K.
