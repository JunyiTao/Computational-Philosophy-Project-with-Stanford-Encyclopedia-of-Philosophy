    "main_text": "Major Philosophical Themes and Methods in Philo || Allegory\n4.1 Allegory\n\nPhilo\u2019s name has almost become a byword for allegory (Sellin\n2011). There are many arguments to defend this association, but it\nwould be an error to affirm that he was merely an allegorist. In many\npassages he defines with precision what can be called his methodology\nof allegory. In Praem. 61\u201365, he says that there are\nsecret meanings, reachable only with God\u2019s help. He\ndistinguishes three cases by which a secret meaning may be\nascertained: (a) directly by divine illumination, or (b1) indirectly\nin the shadow of literal interpretation, and/or (b2) by allegorical\ninterpretation. It must be added that he not only uses the word\nallegoria, but also uponoia, a Platonic term which\nby this time may have been somewhat archaic. The two terms are not\nexactly synonymous for him. In Opif. 157, he posits that\nBiblical tales are not the kind of myths in which poets and sophists\nrejoice but are in fact \u201cindications of character types which\ninvite allegorical interpretation through the explanation of hidden\nmeanings\u201d. Nevertheless, according to Philo, it is an error to\nexclude literal meanings. As he notes in Migr. 89\u201393,\n\n\n\nthere are some who, regarding laws in their literal sense in the light\nof symbols of matters belonging to the intellect, are over punctilious\nabout the latter, while treating the former with easy-going neglect.\nSuch men I for my part should blame for handling the matter in too\neasy and off-hand a manner: they ought to have given careful attention\nto both aims, to a more full and exact investigations of what is not\nseen and in what is seen to be stewards without reproach. \n\n\nFor him, allegory assumes importance when literal interpretation\nencounters difficulty, for example, when it suggests conclusions in\ncontradiction with God\u2019s absolute perfection. In Leg.\n2.19, he does not hesitate to say that the creation of Eve from one of\nAdam\u2019s ribs was a most improbable myth, if taken literally. It\nbecomes likely only if one understands that \u201cribs\u201d are in\nfact the powers of Adam\u2019s mind. It has been amply demonstrated\nthat Philo\u2019s use of allegory was not born ex nihilo.\nFor example, an allegorical interpretation of the garment of the high\npriest (Mos. 2.117) as a microcosmic reproduction of the\nuniverse is found in Wisdom of Solomon 18:24, probably written at the\nend of the first century BCE. This suggests a Jewish source. On the\nother hand, many examples evince Philo\u2019s perfect knowledge of\nGreek allegories in the interpretation of Homeric and Hesiodic myths.\nHe does not hesitate to evoke some of these by name. For example,\nspeaking about the earth in Aet. 63, he says that she was\nrightly called Pandora, since she gives to living things all that is\nuseful. In Greek d\u00f4ron means a present. The allegorical\ninterpretation is here based on etymology, as are those of the\ngreatest Stoic allegorist of the imperial period, Cornutus.\nResearchers have recently shown great interest in Philo\u2019s\nlinguistic remarks. Most of the time, however, he adapts classical\nallegorical interpretations to a Jewish context. For example, in\nConf. 170 he quotes Homer, Iliad 2.204\u2013205,\ntwo verses in which the poet praises the power of a single man. Philo\ndenies that this should be interpreted as a general principle of\npolitics; under his own interpretation, it is instead a poetic\nreference to almighty God. In one of his most famous passages, Philo\ninterprets the tale of Mambre, in Genesis 18:1\u201315, where Abraham\nreceives three men he initially believed to be foreigners. The author\nreminds his readers (QG 4.2) that Homer, who in recounting\nOdysseus\u2019 homecoming, says that gods often disguise themselves\nin order not to be immediately recognized by humans (Odyssey\n17.483\u2013487).\n\nA central problem in Philo\u2019s use of allegory is the nature of\nthe debt he owes to those he calls fusikoi. Since he evokes\nthem regarding the interpretation of some Biblical difficulties, they\nwere most likely Jewish exegetes using Stoic methods in which, at\nleast at that time, etymology played a strong role. For Long (1992),\nthere is a big difference between Stoic \u201callegory\u201d, based\non etymological and, more generally, linguistic bases, and the\nallegories of Philo. Stoic allegoresis, he says, \n\n\nwas not an attempt like [Philo\u2019s], to distinguish figurative\nfrom literal meaning, but an effort to normalize language and remove\nambiguity according to their own understanding of the empirical world.\n(1992 [1996: 210]) \n\n\nIn fact, the problem of the exact nature of Stoic allegoresis is\ncontroversial. It can be remarked that Philo\u2019s allegory is not\nmerely symbolic. Especially when mentioning the fusikoi, he\nhimself draws upon etymology, for example, about Sara whose name in\nthe Chaldean language (i.e., in Hebrew) means \u201cthe ruler\u201d\n(Abr. 99), and for whom nothing is more dominant than virtue\n(80). If it is probable that in Alexandria at this time there were a\ngreat variety of allegorists blending literary, philosophical, and\nspiritual currents, then we can say that Philo was very skillful in\ndrawing upon each of these. To this observation, let us add a\nPhilonian conception of allegory that appears not to have interested\nlater scholars: in his interpretation of one of Joseph\u2019s dreams\nin Somn. 2.8, Philo states that he will follow the method of\nallegory which he calls a \u201cwise architect\u201d. This\nexpression is a \u201chapax\u201d, i.e., an isolated case. The best\nway to understand the meaning of this phrase is given by Plutarch when\nhe says that Alexander, seeking the proper place for the Egyptian city\ndestined to bear his name, had a vision (Life of Alexander\n26). In it, Homer recites two verses for him in which he mentioned the\nisland of Paros (Odyssey 4.354\u201355). Alexander declares\nto his friends that he will follow Homer\u2019s advice since he was\nthe wisest architect\u2014an already well-known story in Alexandria\nto which Philo alludes in his own way. The difference between\nPhilo\u2019s reference to Alexander and Plutarch\u2019s is itself\ninteresting. In the latter case, Homer is not only the greatest poet\nbut also the father of all science. In the former, it is not the poet\nbut the exegete that unveils the meanings of dreams. And dreams sent\nby God always reveal something about the truth of the world.\n",
