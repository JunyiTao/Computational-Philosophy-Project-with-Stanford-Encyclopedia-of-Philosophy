    "main_text": "The challenge of internal diversity || Universalist vs differentialist conceptions of citizenship\n2.1 Universalist vs differentialist conceptions of citizenship\n\nThe universalist or unitary model defines citizenship primarily as a\nlegal status through which an identical set of civil, political and\nsocial rights are accorded to all members of the polity. T.H.\nMarshall\u2019s seminal essay \u201cCitizenship and Social\nClass\u201d is the main reference for this model, which became\nprogressively dominant in post-World War II liberal democracies.\nMarshall\u2019s central thesis was that the 20th\ncentury\u2019s expansion of social rights was crucial to the working\nclass\u2019s progressive integration in British society (Marshall\n 1950).[6]\n Similar stories were told in other Western democracies: the\ndevelopment of welfare policies aimed at softening the impact of\nunemployment, sickness and distress was fundamental to political and\nsocial stability. The apparent success of the post-war welfare state\nin securing social cohesion was a strong argument in favour of a\nconception of citizenship focused on the securing of equal civil,\npolitical and social rights.\n\nThe universalist model was aggressively targeted at the end of the\n1980s as the moral and cultural pluralism of contemporary liberal\nsocieties elicited increasing theoretical attention. Scepticism\ntowards the universalist model was spurred by concerns that the\nextension of citizenship rights to groups previously excluded had not\ntranslated into equality and full integration, notably in the case of\nAfro-Americans and women (Young 1989; Williams 1998). A questioning of\nthe causal relation assumed between citizenship as a uniform legal\nstatus and civic integration followed.\n\nCritics argued that the model proves exclusionary if one interprets\nuniversal citizenship as requiring (a) the transcendence of\nparticular, situated perspectives to achieve a common, general point\nof view and (b) the formulation of laws and policies that are\ndifference-blind (Young 1989). The first requirement seems\nparticularly odious once generality is exposed as a myth covering the\nmajority\u2019s culture and conventions. The call to transcend\nparticularity too often translates into the imposition of the majority\nperspective on minorities. The second requirement may produce more\ninequality rather than less since the purported neutrality of\ndifference-blind institutions often belies an implicit bias towards\nthe needs, interests and identities of the majority group. This bias\noften creates specific burdens for members of minorities, i.e. more\ninequality.\n\nCritics of this (failed) universalism have proposed an alternative\nconception of citizenship based on the acknowledgment of the political\nrelevance of difference (cultural, gender, class, race, etc.). This\nmeans, first, the recognition of the pluralist character of the\ndemocratic public, composed of many perspectives, none of which should\nbe considered a priori more legitimate. Second, it entails\nthat, in certain cases at least, equal respect may justify\ndifferential treatment and the recognition of special minority\nrights.\n\nOnce these two points are conceded, the question becomes when, and for\nwhat reason, the recognition of particular rights is either justified\nor illegitimate. This discussion is necessarily context specific,\nfocusing on concrete demands made by groups in particular\ncircumstances, and shies away from easy generalizations. It has led to\nan array of publications covering issues ranging from the fate of\n\u2018minorities within minorities\u2019 to how tolerant liberal\nsocieties should be of illiberal groups,\n etc.[7]\n\nThe model of differentiated citizenship has generated its own share of\ncriticisms and queries, particularly with regards to the overall\neffects of its implementation. Critics focus on its impact on the\npossibility of a common political practice. Consider Iris\nYoung\u2019s vision of a heterogeneous public where participants\nstart from their \u201csituated positions\u201d and attempt to\nconstruct a dialogue across differences. This dialogue requires\nparticipants to be \u2018public-spirited\u2019 \u2014 open to the\nclaims of others and not single-mindedly self-interested. Unlike\ninterest group pluralism, which does not require justifying\none\u2019s interest as right or as compatible with social justice,\nparticipants are supposed to use deliberation to come to a decision\nthat they determine to be best or more just (Young 1989, 267). While\nwelcoming Young\u2019s conception of the democratic public, one may\ndoubt that the policies and institutions associated with a\ndifferentiated model of citizenship would either motivate or enable\ncitizens to engage in such dialogue.\n\nThis analysis is tied to a wider literature on the virtues required of\ncitizens in pluralist liberal democracies and on ways to favour their\ndevelopment. Stephen Macedo (1990), William Galston (1991), and Eamonn\nCallan (1997), among others, have all emphasized the importance of\npublic reasonableness. This virtue is defined as the ability to listen\nto others and formulate one\u2019s own position in a way that is\nsensitive to, and respectful of, the different experiences and\nidentities of fellow citizens, acknowledging that these differences\nmay affect political views. This raises many questions: how and where\ndoes one develop this and related virtue(s)? If a differentiated model\nof citizenship simply allows individuals and groups to retreat into\ntheir particular enclaves, how are they to develop either the\nmotivation or the capacity to participate in a common forum?\n\nThis explains the abiding interest of political philosophers in\neducation. If citizens of diverse societies are to develop the\n\u2018right\u2019 attitudes and dispositions, does this mean\nencouraging a common education, the development of a school curriculum\nthat teaches respect for difference, while providing the necessary\nskills for democratic discussion across these differences? In this\ncase, should demands for separate schools or dispensations for\nminorities be resisted? How flexible should public schools be towards\nminorities if the goal is to make them feel welcome and ensure that\nthey do not retreat into parochial institutions (Callan 1997; Gutmann\n1999; Brighouse 2000,\n 2006)?[8]\n\nCritics of differentiated citizenship have also argued that policies\nthat break with difference-blind universalism weaken the integrative\nfunction of citizenship. If embracing multicultural and minority\nrights means that citizens lose their sense of collective belonging,\nit may also affect their willingness to compromise and make sacrifices\nfor each other. Citizens may then develop a purely strategic attitude\ntowards those of different backgrounds. As Joseph Carens puts it:\n\u201cFrom this perspective, the danger of [\u2026] differentiated\ncitizenship is that the emphasis [it] place[s] on the recognition and\ninstitutionalization of difference could undermine the conditions that\nmake a sense of common identification and thus mutuality\npossible\u201d (Carens 2000, 193).\n\nIn addressing these and similar queries, Will Kymlicka and Wayne\nNorman have broadly distinguished between three types of demands:\nspecial representation rights (for disadvantaged groups),\nmulticultural rights (for immigrant and religious groups) and\nself-government rights (for national minorities) (Kymlicka and Norman\n1994; Kymlicka, 1995, 176\u2013187). The first two are really demands\nfor inclusion into mainstream society: special representation rights\nare best understood as (temporary) measures to alleviate the obstacles\nthat minorities and/or historically disadvantaged groups face in\nhaving their voices heard in majoritarian democratic institutions.\nReforming the electoral system to ensure the better representation of\nminorities may raise all sorts of difficult issues, but the aim is\nclearly integration into the larger political society, not\nisolation.\n\nSimilarly, the demands for multicultural rights made by immigrant\ngroups are usually aimed either at exemption from laws and policies\nthat disadvantage them because of their religious practices or at\nensuring public support for particular education and/or cultural\ninitiatives to maintain and transmit elements of their cultural and\nreligious heritage. These should be seen as measures designed to\nfacilitate their inclusion in the larger society rather than as a way\nto avoid integration. It is only claims to self-government rights,\ngrounded in a principle of self-determination, that potentially\nendanger civic integration since their aim is not to achieve a greater\npresence in the institutions of the central government, but to gain a\ngreater share of power and legislative jurisdiction for institutions\ncontrolled by national minorities.\n\nAddressing this kind of demand through a simple reaffirmation of the\nideal of common citizenship is not a serious option. It may only\naggravate the alienation felt by members of these groups and feed into\nmore radical political projects, including secession. Further, to say\nthat recognition of self-government rights may weaken the bonds of the\nlarger community is to suppose that these bonds exist in the first\nplace and that a significant proportion of national minorities\nidentify with the larger society. This may be overly optimistic. If\nthese bonds do not exist, or remain quite weak, what is needed is the\nconstruction of a genuine dialogue between the majority society and\nminorities over what constitutes just relations, through which\ndifference can be recognized. The hope is that dialogue would\nstrengthen, rather than weaken, their relationship by putting it on\nfirmer moral and political grounds (Carens 2000, 197).\n\nThis broadly positive assessment of the effects of differentiated\ncitizenship on civic integration is contested. On the one hand,\nleft-leaning authors have complained that multicultural politics make\negalitarian policies more difficult to achieve by diverting\n\u201cpolitical effort away from universalistic goals\u201d and by\nundermining efforts to build a broadly based coalition supporting\nambitious policies of redistribution (Barry 2001, 325). On the other\nhand, events like September 11, the Mohammed cartoons affair (2005,\nsee Klausen 2009), riots in the banlieux of Paris (2005),\nLondon (2011) and Stockholm (2017), as well as a series of terrorist\nattacks in Europe have led to a backlash against multicultural\npolicies. The belief that demands for multicultural rights are really\ndemands for inclusion in the larger society has been thrown into\ndoubt, notably in the case of Muslim immigrants.\n\nTo allay fears about the supposed trade-off between cultural\nrecognition and redistribution, supporters of multiculturalism cite\nthe lack of empirical studies establishing a negative correlation\nbetween the adoption of multicultural policies and a robust welfare\nstate (Banting and Kymlicka 2006, Banting 2005). Further, claims that\nthe push for multicultural policies diverts energies, time and\nresources from the struggle for redistributive policies assume that\nthe pursuit of justice is zero-sum, seemingly a false generalization.\nOn the contrary, it can be argued that: \u201cthe pursuit of justice\nin one dimension helps build a broader political culture that supports\nstruggles for justice in other dimensions\u201d (Kymlicka 2009). In\nthe same vein, to claim that paying attention to issues of cultural\nrecognition tends to warp our sensitivity to economic injustice is to\nassume that we can only be sensitive to one dimension of injustice at\na time. However, it is equally plausible that sensitivity to a\nparticular type of injustice may favour, rather than hinder,\nsensitivity to other injustices.\n\nIn response to concerns about social and civic unity, liberal\ndemocracies have introduced a series of policies aimed at better\nsecuring the integration of immigrants: requiring minimal linguistic\nproficiency in the majority language as a condition of citizenship or\nbanning religious symbols from public schools. These policies have\nsometimes been heralded as signaling the development of a\n\u2018muscular liberalism\u2019 (Former British PM David Cameron,\nquoted by Joppke 2014) as an alternative to multiculturalism. They\nhave been hotly debated from the perspective of factual efficacy as\nwell as from a normative perspective. The introduction of\n\u2018citizenship tests\u2019 for resident immigrants has led to a\nvigorous debate among normative theorists: under what conditions and\nin what form can they be justified? Some, like Carens (2010a), have\nargued that they are basically unjust, no matter what form they take.\nIf one understands membership in a society to flow from long-term\nresidence, as Carens does, then any test that \u201cprevents a full\nmember of a society from becoming a citizen unjustly deprives her of\nan entitlement to citizenship\u201d (Mason 2014, 143). Other\ntheorists have taken a more positive view of the tests: seeing them as\nan incentive for immigrants to acquire basic knowledge of\nliberal-democratic principles, as well as the political institutions\nand history of the host country. As such, they also serve as an\n\u201cimplicit statement of the nation\u2019s political\nvalues\u201d (Miller 2016, 138). On this view, as long as certain\nconditions are met, so that the tests are neither too difficult nor\ntoo expensive and give applicants the possibility to take them again\nif they fail, etc., then there is nothing deeply objectionable to them\n(though the empirical question of their efficacy remains open). In\ncontrast, tests that purport to \u2018weed out\u2019 immigrants who\ndo not share \u2018our\u2019 liberal values are generally held to be\nincompatible with liberal principles. This has led some theorists to\nquestion how \u2018muscular\u2019 can liberalism really be (Joppke\n2014).\n\nIn the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, some liberal\ndemocracies have introduced legislation giving the state the power to\nrevoke the citizenship of those convicted or suspected of terrorist\n activities.[9]\n Given the principle recognized in international law that no one\nshould be left stateless, these legislations usually apply only to\ncitizens holding dual or multiple citizenships.\n\u2018Denationalisation\u2019 is sometimes described in this context\nas \u201ca technique for extending the functionality of immigration\nlaw in counter-terrorism\u201d (Macklin 2015, see also Barry and\nFerracioli 2016). Though states cannot deport their own citizens,\ndenationalisation allows them to first withdraw citizenship and then\ndeport. These legislations raise several normative issues. Firstly,\nthey seem to contradict the basic idea that citizenship is a\nfundamental right, not a privilege (Lenard 2018; Gibney 2013; Macklin\n2015). Secondly, since they weaken the security normally attached to\nthe status of citizen, they can be described as demoting citizenship\n\u201cto another category of permanent residence\u201d (Macklin\n2015). Thirdly, it is argued that by targeting only dual (or multiple)\ncitizens, the new legislations treat them as second-class citizens\n(Gibney 2013, 653). In contrast, other theorists insist that that the\nnature of terrorist crimes (akin to acts of war against the state)\nwarrants this kind of response (Schuck 2015; Joppke 2015). Concerning\nthe worry that the legislations discriminate against dual citizens,\nthe response is that the difference in treatment between mono-citizens\nand dual citizens is justified since the consequences of\ndenationalisation are also very different in each case. Individuals\nholding a single citizenship are the only ones facing statelessness as\na consequence of denationalisation (Barry and Ferracioli 2016). Where\nparticipants in the debate find some common ground is in their shared\ncriticism of the specific form that some legislations have taken, most\nnotably the 2006 British Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act. In\nthe wake of the 7 July 2005 Tube bombing in London, the Act replaced\nthe standard for deprivation present in the 2002 legislation (the\n\u201cvital interests of the state\u201d test) with a much weaker\nand vague standard providing for revocation in cases where an\nindividual\u2019s holding citizenship is \u201cnot conducive to the\npublic good\u201d (quoted by Gibney 2013, 650). Also deeply\nconcerning is the progressive expansion of legislative measures to\nallow for \u201cproactive and administrative\ndenationalisation\u201d (Brown Prener 2023, 3\u20134). While the\nefficiency of denationalisation as a measure aimed at reducing the\nincidence of terrorist activity remains doubtful, its value appears to\nbe primarily symbolic, expressing what some authors see as a\n\u2018fitting\u2019 response of liberal democracies to those intent\non attacking their very foundations (Barry and Ferracioli 2016; see\nLenard 2018 for a counterargument). This symbolic understanding of\ndenationalisation highlights the persistent significance of the\nlanguage of allegiance in contemporary liberal democratic thought,\nthough some argue that this very language is incompatible with liberal\ndemocratic principles (Irving 2022).\n\nWorries about the integration of Muslim immigrants in Western liberal\ndemocracies have fostered a persisting interest in the complex\nrelations between the liberal political cultures dominant in the West,\nthe different versions of secularism that they affirm, religion, and\ncitizens of faith. Research has focused on religion\u2019s place in\nthe public sphere (Parekh 2006, Laborde 2008, Brahm Levey and Modood\n2009, Modood 2019) as well as on the relation between religion,\ngender, and\n citizenship.[10]\n",
