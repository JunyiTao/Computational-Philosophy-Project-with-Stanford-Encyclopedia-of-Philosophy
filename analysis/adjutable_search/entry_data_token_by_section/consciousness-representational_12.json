Objections to the Representational Theory\n\nThe (strong) representational theory entails the obvious supervenience\nclaim: that there can be no difference in sensory qualities without a\nrepresentational difference. Objections to the theory have most often\ncome in the form of counterexamples to that thesis. But we shall begin\nwith four more general complaints.\n",
