    "main_text": "What is mental imagery? || The format of mental imagery\n1.5 The format of mental imagery\n\nThe format of a representation is different from its content. Two\nrepresentations can have the same content but different formats. The\nusual starting point of talking about representational format is the\ndifference between the way pictures and sentences represent. Pictures\nrepresent imagistically or iconically and sentences represent\nnon-imagistically or propositionally. They may represent the same\nthing: say, a red apple on a green table. But they represent this red\napple on a green table differently (for example, to just mention one\noften-emphasized difference, very few parts of the sentence\n\u201cthere is a red apple on a green table\u201d represent part of\nwhat the sentence itself represents, whereas many parts of the picture\nof the red apple on a green table represent part of what the whole\npicture represents) \u2013 the format of the representation is\ndifferent.\n\nSo the question is: does mental imagery represent the way pictures do\nor the way sentences do? This was the central question of the\nso-called \u2018Imagery Debate\u2019 of the 1980s (in the imagistic\ncorner: Kosslyn 1980, in the propositional corner: Pylyshyn 1981, see\nTye 1991 for a good summary). It was this debate that made\nphilosophers take the concept of mental imagery seriously again, after\na long period of behaviorist-inspired skepticism about anything\nimagery-related.\n\nThe Imagery Debate is historically significant for yet another reason:\nit helped us to appreciate how interpersonal variations in mental\nimagery can have a major impact on one\u2019s\nphilosophical/theoretical positions. An important and fairly large\nstudy conducted at a time when the Imagery Debate was on its way out\nshows this very clearly. It mapped how philosophers\u2019 and\npsychologists\u2019 intuitions about the format of mental imagery\nvary as a result of the vividness of their mental imagery. The results\nshowed that the vividness of imagery has significant impact on\ntheoretical commitments in this debate (Reisberg 2003). Researchers\nwith less vivid mental imagery were more likely to take the\npropositional side and those with more vivid mental imagery tended to\ncome down on the iconic side.\n\nAs the dependence on the vividness of one\u2019s mental imagery\nshows, it is far from clear that the Imagery Debate is a substantive\ndebate, and many psychologists and neuroscientists (including some of\nthe original participants of this debate) explicitly declared this\ndebate dead (see esp. Pearson and Kosslyn 2015). There are many ways\nof characterizing the distinction between imagistic and propositional\nformats, some more controversial than others. Appeal to holism or the\n\u2018picture principle\u2019 have been more on the controversial\nside (Kulvicki 2014). Describing iconic format as\n\u201crepresentation of magnitudes, by magnitudes\u201d (Peacocke\n2019, p. 52) is on the less controversial side. And at least according\nto these criteria it seems clear that mental imagery has iconic\nformat.\n\nPerceptual representations represent magnitudes by means of\nmagnitudes. In the case of vision, for example, they represent\nmagnitudes like illumination, contours, color and they do so by means\nof magnitudes in the early sensory cortices. The early visual cortices\nare retinotopic (Grill-Spector and Malach 2004 for a summary and\nTalavage et al. 2004 on equivalent claims regarding the non-visual\nsense modalities). If you are looking at a triangle, there is a\nroughly triangle-pattern activation of direction-sensitive neurons in\nyour primary visual cortex. This is iconic format par excellence. And\nif you visualize a triangle, there is also a roughly triangle-pattern\nactivation of direction-sensitive neurons in your primary visual\ncortex (Kosslyn et al. 2006). Again, iconic format par excellence, at\nleast according to the \u2018representation of magnitudes, by\nmagnitudes\u2019 criteria.\n",
