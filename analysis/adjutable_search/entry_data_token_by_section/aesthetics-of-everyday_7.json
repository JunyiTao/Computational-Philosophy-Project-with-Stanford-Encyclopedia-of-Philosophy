Blurring the Line between Art and Life\n\nThe emergence of everyday aesthetics discourse parallels the\nincreasing attempt at blurring the distinction between art and life in\ntoday\u2019s artworld. Although there have been many examples\nthroughout art history of depicting slices of everyday life,\nsuch as Dutch still life paintings, twentieth-century art introduced\nand experimented with different modes of appropriating everyday life,\nmost famously with the use of ready-mades. Since then, artists have\nbeen trying to overcome the presumed separation between art and real\nlife in a number of ways: rejecting the art institutional setting as a\nlocation for their art; denying the necessity of authorial authority;\nembracing various changes made to their works both by nature and human\nagency; blurring the creator/spectator dichotomy by collaborating with\nthe general public to create art as a joint venture; changing the role\nof the artist from the creator/choreographer to a facilitator who\nprovides an occasion or an event for things to happen; literally\nimproving the environment and society by planting trees, cleaning a\nriver, and playing the role of a social worker to promote a dialogue\namong people in conflict; and engaging in mundane activities like\ncooking and farming with tangible products for consumption. These\nattempts have given rise to a number of genres, including situationist\nart, conceptual art, environmental art, happening, performance,\nactivist art, socially engaged art, and art projects characterized as\nembodying \u201crelational aesthetics\u201d or \u201cdialogical\naesthetics\u201d (Kaprow 1993; Spaid 2002, 2012; Bourriaud 2002;\nKester 2004, 2011; Dezeuze 2006; Johnstone 2008; Bishop 2012).\n\nParalleling the movement of art to embrace everyday life, there is a\nmovement in the opposite direction: for everyday life to embrace art.\nWhile aestheticization of life is not a new phenomenon, what is\nnoteworthy in the so-called organizational aesthetics and artification\nstrategy is that they deploy art and art-like ways of thinking and\nacting in those areas of life which have not been traditionally\nassociated with art or aesthetics: medicine, business, education,\nsports, and science, among others, as well as organizational life in\ngeneral (Dars\u00f8 2004; Naukkarinen and Saito 2012; Ratiu 2017b).\nThese professional practices typically privilege rational discourse\ncomprised of logic and rules, but they cannot ignore their aesthetic\ndimensions. Art and aesthetics in this context are not regarded as\ndecorative amenities or prettifying touches. Rather, organizational\naesthetics and artification strategy are based upon the premise that\nhumans negotiate life, whatever the context may be, through sensory\nknowledge and affective experiences by interacting with others and the\nenvironment. As such, working with the aesthetic dimensions of these\nprofessional activities and environments cannot but help achieve the\nrespective goals and, perhaps more importantly, contribute to the\nwellbeing of the members and participants. Art and aesthetics can be a\npowerful ally in directing human endeavors and actions and determining\nthe quality of activities and environments. Such effects range from\nfacilitating creativity and imagination in educational and business\nventures and providing humane and healing environments for vulnerable\npopulations, such as hospital patients and nursing home residents, to\nrendering scientific data easily graspable (Pine and Gilmore 1998;\nLinstead 2000; Postrel 2003; Howes 2005, 2013; Duncum 2007; Tavin\n2007; Dee 2010, 2012; Schulze 2013; Moss and O\u2019Neill 2013, 2014;\nRatiu 2017b; Krawczyk forthcoming).\n\nAs stated at the beginning of this entry, everyday aesthetics was\nfirst proposed as a way of accounting for those aesthetically charged\ndimensions of our lives that had not been adequately addressed by\nart-centered aesthetics. However, early works of everyday aesthetics,\nsuch as given by Saito (2007), are criticized for a rather outdated\nand overly restrictive characterization of so-called art-centered\naesthetics. The presumed distinguishing conditions of art-aesthetics,\nsuch as a relatively clear frame, privileging higher sense, authorial\nidentity, stable identity of the object, and the spectator mode of\nexperience, are no longer applicable to many examples of art today.\nConsequently, the critics urge everyday aesthetics to go beyond simply\nproviding a venue to enumerate those aesthetic dimensions of everyday\nlife that had previously been overlooked and to provide a conceptual\nfoundation. In particular, they advocate conceiving everyday\naesthetics as a continuation of aesthetics discourse that had\npreviously been focused on art (the view variously characterized as a\nweak formulation, continuistic pole, extraordinarist stance, or\nmonolithist model), rather than as something distinct and separate\nfrom art aesthetics (a strong formulation, discontinuistic pole,\nfamiliarity stance, or pluralist model) (see Dowling 2010; Ratiu 2013;\nIannilli 2016; Matteucci 2016 for a clear and helpful\n\u201cmapping\u201d and \u201cnomenclature\u201d of these strands\nof everyday aesthetics).\n\nThose who support the continuity model are specifically concerned to\nprovide a basis for intersubjectivity and normativity for everyday\naesthetics by referencing these features that support aesthetics\ndiscourse in general. Without such a framework, the worry is that\neveryday aesthetics may degenerate into a totally subjective, laissez\nfaire affair which would render the entire project trivial. Unless we\npresuppose the possibility of a sensus communis, that is,\ncommunicability though not necessarily commonality, which makes\nsharing and understanding the other\u2019s experience possible, we\nare locked into a subjective, solipsistic silo. Furthermore, they\npoint out that the monadic characterization of everyday aesthetics\nwithin the general aesthetics discourse is not conducive to fruitfully\naccounting for the ways in which everyday life and art interact and\nform a continuous, ongoing flux of a person\u2019s embodied\nexperience of the lived world. Popular and socially engaged forms of\nart permeate people\u2019s everyday life more than ever and there is\nno reason not to consider experiencing them as a pervasive dimension\nof their lived world. Ultimately, the nature of art is open and\ndynamic and is very much an integral part of people\u2019s life, and\neveryday aesthetics is better served by considering the continuity\nbetween art and everyday. In other words, the initial reactionary mode\nof everyday aesthetics needs to be recast as a proactive mode that\naddresses the totality of our aesthetic engagement with the world,\nwhich includes art, nature, and everyday (Ratiu 2013; Potgieter 2017).\nAlthough approaching the issue from a different angle, another\npossibility is to develop Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s distribution of the\nsensible and explore what is deemed aesthetically relevant within a\nspecific cultural/historical/social context. For the consideration of\nthe regime of the sensible, the presumed distinction between art and\nlife becomes irrelevant (Vihalem 2018).\n",
