In baseball, for\ninstance, it appears that over time batters have been striking out\nmore frequently, despite their improving in their ability to hit more\ndifficult pitches while remaining as good at hitting less difficult\nones (Watt 2016 [see Other Internet Resources]). \nThis could be accounted for by the fact that\npitchers have been throwing a higher proportion of difficult-to-hit\npitches. This highlights the way that statistics about success rates\nin performing a task can be misleading in cases where the\ntask-difficulty changes over time.\n",
