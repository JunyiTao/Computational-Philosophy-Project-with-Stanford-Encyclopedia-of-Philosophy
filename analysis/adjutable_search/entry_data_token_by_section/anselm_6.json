    "main_text": "Freedom, Sin, and Redemption || Truth in statements and in the will\n4.1 Truth in statements and in the will\n\nIn On Freedom of Choice (De libertate arbitrii)\nAnselm defines freedom of choice as \u201cthe power to preserve\nrectitude of will for its own sake\u201d (DLA 3). He\nexplores the notion of rectitude of will most thoroughly in On\nTruth (De veritate), so in order to understand the\ndefinition of freedom of choice, we must look first at Anselm\u2019s\ndiscussion of truth. Truth is a much broader notion for Anselm than\nfor us; he speaks of truth not only in statements and opinions but\nalso in the will, actions, the senses, and even the essences of\nthings. In every case, he argues, truth consists in correctness or\n\u201crectitude.\u201d Rectitude, in turn, is understood\nteleologically; a thing is correct whenever it is or does whatever it\nought, or was designed, to be or do. For example, statements are made\nfor the purpose of \u201csignifying that what-is is\u201d\n(DV 2). A statement therefore is correct (has rectitude)\nwhen, and only when, it signifies that what-is is. So Anselm holds a\ncorrespondence theory of truth, but it is a somewhat unusual\ncorrespondence theory. Statements are true when they correspond to\nreality, but only because corresponding to reality is what statements\nare for. That is, statements (like anything else) are true\nwhen they do what they were designed to do; and what they were\ndesigned to do, as it happens, is to correspond to reality.\n\nTruth in the will also turns out to be rectitude, again understood\nteleologically. Rectitude of will means willing what one ought to will\nor (in other words) willing that for the sake of which one was given a\nwill. So, just as the truth or rectitude of a statement is the\nstatement\u2019s doing what statements were made to do, the truth or\nrectitude of a will is the will\u2019s doing what wills were made to\ndo. In DV 12 Anselm connects rectitude of will to both\njustice and moral evaluation. In a broad sense of \u2018just\u2019,\nwhatever is as it ought to be is just. Thus, an animal is just when it\nblindly follows its appetites, because that is what animals were meant\nto do. But in the narrower sense of \u2018just\u2019, in which\njustice is what deserves moral approval and injustice is what deserves\nreproach, justice is best defined as \u201crectitude of will\npreserved for its own sake\u201d (DV 12). Such rectitude\nrequires that agents perceive the rectitude of their actions and will\nthem for the sake of that rectitude. Anselm takes the second\nrequirement to exclude both coercion and \u201cbeing bribed by an\nextraneous reward\u201d (DV 12). For an agent who is coerced\ninto doing what is right is not willing rectitude for its own sake;\nand similarly, an agent who must be bribed to do what is right is\nwilling rectitude for the sake of the bribe, not for the sake of\nrectitude.\n\nSince, as we have already seen, Anselm will define freedom as\n\u201cthe power to preserve rectitude of will for its own\nsake,\u201d the arguments of On Truth imply that freedom is\nalso the capacity for justice and the capacity for moral\npraiseworthiness. Now it is both necessary and sufficient for justice,\nand thus for praiseworthiness, that an agent wills what is right,\nknowing it to be right, because it is right. That an agent wills what\nis right because it is right entails that he is neither compelled nor\nbribed to perform the act. Freedom, then, must be neither more nor\nless than the power to perform acts of that sort.\n",
