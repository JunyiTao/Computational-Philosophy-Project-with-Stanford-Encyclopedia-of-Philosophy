Newton argues that the parts of space are their own places,\nand for a place to be moved out of itself is absurd. A more expansive\nantecedent of this argument occurs in De Gravitatione,\napplied specifically to time: if yesterday and tomorrow were to\ninterchange their temporal relations with respect to the remainder of\ntime, then yesterday would become today, and today yesterday. Thus,\nNewton held an interestingly holistic identity criterion for the parts\nof space and time.  \n",
