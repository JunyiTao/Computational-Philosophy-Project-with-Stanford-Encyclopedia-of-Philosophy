    "main_text": "Libertarianism, Left and Right\n5. Anarchism and the State\n\nLibertarians are highly skeptical of political authority and state\nlegitimacy. Where a state is understood to be an agency with an\nexclusive right to lay down and enforce laws within a territory, it is\nnot clear how it could do this without either the consent of all\npeople subject to it, or by violating all of the rights of its\ncitizens. Of course, all states fail to satisfy this requirement for\nmost of their subjects (Spooner 1867, Simmons 1976, 1993). Many\nlibertarians embrace, at least philosophical, anarchism, and are\nthereby deeply suspicious of social contract theory. Philosophical\nanarchists believe that we have no duty to obey the laws of the state\nsimply because they come from the state. Some laws reflect natural\nmoral precepts like \u201cdo not murder or steal,\u201d and so we\nshould obey those laws because they happen to be just, but not because\nthe state has made them just. The implication of this is that\nthe state\u2019s enforcement of the rest of their body of law is\nillegitimate, and amounts to little more than a large group of armed\nagents imposing their will on non-consenting third parties.\n\nThe strongest version of the libertarian critique of the state\u2019s\nauthority is articulated by Lysander Spooner: the laws of the state\neither reflect natural justice and are therefore superfluous, or they\ncontravene natural justice, and are illegitimate (1882). Libertarians\nare not necessarily political anarchists in that they may\nbelieve justice is not served by directly attempting to abolish the\nstate (e.g., Simmons 2000, ch. 6), though many are (e.g. Chartier\n2012, ch. 6) Libertarian anarchists tend to be optimistic about the\npossibility of anarchic provision of justice, and of public goods, and\noffer sophisticated, if radical, accounts of how a just, stateless\nsociety could operate (Barnett 1986b, 2014 chs 7\u20139, Molinari\n1849, Rothbard 1978, ch. 12, Friedman 1989, pt. 2, Hoppe 2009, Huemer\n2012, chs 10\u201312, Chartier 2012, chs 3\u20135, Leeson 2014, Long\n2008b, Murphy 2008, Skoble 2008, Tannehill & Tannehill 1970, pt.\n2). The right-libertarian1 version of this theory is known\nas anarcho-capitalism whereas the left-libertarian1\nversion is known as left market anarchism.\n\nEssential to the libertarian view of the state is the moral parity\nthesis which says that individual state actors \u2013 and\ntherefore, states as composite actors \u2013 have the same rights and\nduties as private citizens (Brennan 2016b, 2019, 2021). Libertarians\ntherefore sharply differ from, for example, neo-Roman republicans and\nneo-Kantians in rejecting any fundamental distinction between public\nand private action. For libertarians, only a person\u2019s consent\ncan give you the right to do things to them that would ordinarily be\nrights-violations. The purportedly special moral status of acting in a\npublic capacity is not something that libertarians can reconcile with\nnatural equality (Long 1995, 2001 [Other Internet Resources],\nChristmas 2019).\n\nEven though libertarians are generally quite hostile to state\nauthority, this does not mean that the state cannot permissibly\nundertake certain minimal activities. After all, if all persons are\nentitled to defend rights, then the state may undertake such actions\nas well. It has the same permission to enforce individual rights as\nanyone else. However, it does not have any prima facie right to stop\nothers from doing this too. These activities do not presuppose any\nspecial authority since such activities are permissible with or\nwithout people\u2019s prior consent (unless, of course, such\nactivities involve the violation of rights themselves). However, no\nagency that engages in rights-protection could force anyone to pay for\nits protection, and hence could not legitimately exercise a tax power.\nWithout the right to tax and to hold an exclusive right to use force\nto protect rights, the state is really just a private agency like any\nother.\n\nRobert Nozick offered a controversial and subtle argument that a\nstate, with strictly curtailed domain of activity, could exist without\nanyone\u2019s rights being violated. It is often known as an\n\u201cinvisible hand argument\u201d for the state (1974, pt 1). In a\nsituation in which rights were enforced by a plethora of protective\nassociations, where each association protects the rights of those who\nvoluntarily chose to become members and pay fees, there would be a\nsignificant advantage in being a member of that protective association\nwith the most members within your territory. The more people who are\nin the same protective association as you, the more people you can\nhave peaceful, predictable, low risk social and economic interactions\nwith. For this reason, Nozick believed one protective association\nwould come to dominate the market for protection and would be a de\nfacto monopoly. Those who are not members of the association, if\nand when they enter a dispute over rights with a member, will have no\nother choice but to be subjected to the dominant associations\nprocedures for determining wrongdoing. Whilst the dominant association\ndoes not claim any exclusive right to administer all disputes, it is,\nby a matter of fact, the only agency administering disputes (Bader\n2021).\n\nWhen there is a plurality of competing associations, each particular\nassociation has an interest in cooperating with others when a dispute\narises between its respective members. However, when there is one\ndominant association, Nozick argues that it serves its members by\noutlawing new competitors, given that it would introduce alternative\nand most importantly risky procedures into its system of\nadministering justice. In coercively prohibiting new entrance into the\nprotection market, it enforces its monopoly, and thereby becomes a\nde jure monopoly and not a merely de facto one.\n\nMoreover, Nozick argues that this association can even charge fees to\nthose who do not voluntarily become members, so long as it provides\nthem with protection that provides protection to their rights that\nleaves their rights as protected or more protected than if they did\nnot. So, out of anarchy, a state emerges without violating\nanyone\u2019s rights. Of course, if the state engaged in any further\nactivities, for example, redistributing wealth in a way that was not\nstrictly necessary to the protection if rights, it would be\nviolating rights and would be illegitimate. This state is therefore\nreferred to as the \u201cminimal state\u201d.\n\nThere are reasons to think that when it comes to enforcing justice, it\nis important that there be an agency whose decision is final. This, is\na matter of fact, is going to be the one with the greatest capacity\nfor coercion. Some therefore believe states as such can have\nlegitimacy so long as they primarily use their unique capacity for\ncoercion to secure justice (Renzo 2011, Christmas 2022b).\n\nNozick\u2019s argument is a potentially strong one as it uses\nanarchist premises to argue that a state could in principle emerge\nthrough just steps. Note also that it applies to both\nright-libertarian2 and left-libertarian2\ntheories, on the latter the state is just enforcing a different\nset of rights over external objects.\n\nWhilst the argument is sophisticated, it has come under attack from a\nvariety of angles. Anarchists argue that a de facto monopoly would not\nbe just in using force to prohibit anyone else from forming a new\nprotective association. Therefore any de facto monopoly remains merely\nde facto and challengers to the state would always be justified in\nprotecting people\u2019s rights in alternative ways so long as they\nwere consistent with justice (Chartier 2011, pp. 257\u2013262). They\nalso argue that a de facto monopoly is less likely to be a faithful\nguarantor of justice and the possibility of external challenge is\nnecessary to safeguard justice (Long 2008b).\n\nNon-libertarian liberals argue that even if the argument is internally\ncoherent in terms of showing that a de jure monopoly could emerge\njustly, it does not yield a state that wields public power,\nbut only a form of overwhelming private power, such as the states of\nfeudal Europe (Freeman 2001, Anderson 2017). To be a legitimate\ngovernment, a state must exercise power over all on behalf of\nall, and not simply be a nexus of private contracts between\nindividuals.\n\nAn additional problem with the argument is that Nozick presents the\nminimal state as if it were the terminus of the invisible hand\nprocesses rather than a moment on a continuum. Whilst he insists that\nanarchy would not be a stable equilibrium and a minimal state would\nemerge, he does not attempt to show that a minimal state is a stable\nequilibrium. Once it has succeeded in having a justified monopoly on\nrights protection, it may well continue to extent its power,\ninfluence, and wealth beyond that which is necessary to secure\nindividuals\u2019 rights.\n\nRelatedly, Nozick argues that taxation is only justified to the extent\nthat it is necessary to fund the protection of rights. This is often\ntaken to mean that the state would be \u201csmall\u201d and its\ntaxes \u201clow\u201d. However, there is an important difference\nbetween minimalism in terms of the quality justificatory grounds of\nstate power, and minimalism in the actual quantitative size of the\nstate. It is possible that due to empirical circumstances, a state\nthat is limited to only protecting rights, and only taxing so much as\nto fund such activities, nonetheless requires a vast bureaucratic\napparatus. If this turns out to be the case, questions arise as to how\nsuch a large organization should be internally organized in order to\nensure its efficient functioning. It may require elements of\nbureaucracy and administrative discretion, as well as democracy and\nopen-access. Therefore, the size and structure of government is not\ndetermined a priori by its functions being limited to the protection\nof rights. Whilst the courts and the police are the morally necessary\noutputs of the state apparatus, we cannot know a priori what\norganizational complexities are necessary for their stable and\nefficient functioning. Whatever they are, they seem to be consistent\nwith the normative foundations of the minimal state (Murphy 2023).\nNon-ideal libertarian theorizing along these lines converges with\nneoliberalism, insofar as it recognizes a reasonably strong state as\ninstrumentally essential to the maintenance of a market-based social\norder (Vallier 2021).\n\nDemocratic theorists often argue that state authority holds that\nstates can be legitimate if they are democratic, libertarians tend to\nbe skeptical about this view. A large body of empirical findings has\nshown that voters tend to be radically uninformed, ignorant, and\nbiased about political issues. And democratic deliberation does\nlittle, if anything, to improve this. Indeed, it seems like it is\nrational for people to remain ignorant about politics. Given that\none\u2019s causal influence on the quality of political decisions is\nnegligible, and it is costly in terms of time and effort to become\ninformed, it is rational for people to remain ignorant. Most people\nthus vote in ways that have more to do with signaling their\nideological allegiance or virtues, and less with the merits of the\nissues (Caplan 2008, Somin 2016, Brennan 2016a, Pincione &\nTes\u00f3n 2011).\n\nIn addition to voter ignorance, many libertarians fear the more\ngeneral dynamics of state power. Public choice theory points out that\nsince the best way to understand the behavior of political agents is\nalong roughly maximizing lines, there is little reason to think that\nthe state will generally behave in the public interest (Tullock &\nBuchanan 1962). Thus, many government policies impose widely dispersed\ncosts on the populace to confer localized benefits on a few, often\npolitically well-connected elites. Examples include the large-scale\nbailouts of financial companies and agricultural subsidies.\n\nWhere libertarians view of democracy positively it will therefore be\ninstrumental in general, and agonistic in particular.\nDemocracy\u2019s value will be cashed out in terms of its role in\nlimiting the excessing power of the state, rather than in any\npurported intrinsic value of citizens sharing positive control over\ngovernment (Levy 2017). Democratic regimes, whilst far from ideal on a\nlibertarian standard, tend to have a far better track record of\nsupporting individual rights to socioeconomic liberty than any other\nregime. Whilst voters do not turn out to vote for candidates favouring\nlibertarian reforms per se, the overall effect of democratic\ninstitutions seems to be a liberalizing force on government and a\nconstraint on state excess, on this view of democracy (Levy 2018).\n",
