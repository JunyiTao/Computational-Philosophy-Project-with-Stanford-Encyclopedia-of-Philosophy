    "main_text": "Biographical\n1. Biographical\n\nChisholm was born in North Attleboro, Massachusetts in 1916. As an\nundergraduate, he studied philosophy at Brown University where he\nworked with a number of distinguished philosophers including C. J.\nDucasse and R. M. Blake. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University\nin 1942. At Harvard, Chisholm worked mainly with C. I. Lewis and\nDonald C. Williams. Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore visited Harvard\nduring Chisholm\u2019s time there and each of them evidently played\nan important role in Chisholm\u2019s development as a\nphilosopher.\n\nAfter serving in the Army (primarily as a psychological tester) and\ngetting married, Chisholm was employed briefly as a lecturer at the\nBarnes Foundation in Pennsylvania. An amusing account of\nChisholm\u2019s experience at the Barnes Foundation can be found in\nChisholm\u2019s intellectual autobiography in [LLP]. He then returned\nto Brown as an assistant professor. He remained at Brown for the rest\nof his long career (aside from periods as visiting professor at\nHarvard, Graz, Princeton, Chicago, Massachusetts, Salzburg, and\nseveral other places). He was Editor of Philosophy and\nPhenomenological Research from 1980 until 1986. He was then\nAssociate Editor until the time of his death.\n\nAs a result of his dealings with Russell and Moore, Chisholm became\naware of the work of Brentano and Meinong. His interest in these\nphilosophers eventually led to correspondence with Austrian\nphilosophers and visits to Graz. Several of Chisholm\u2019s\npublications, perhaps especially \u201cSentences about\nBelieving\u201d and [B&IV], helped to make some of\nBrentano\u2019s leading ideas familiar to American philosophers. In\n1972 Chisholm was awarded an honorary doctorate at Graz. He was\nintrigued to discover that it would now be correct to address him as\n\u201cProfessor Doktor Doktor h. c. Roderick M. Chisholm.\u201d\n\nChisholm was a tremendously successful teacher of philosophy. His\ncourses, both at the undergraduate level and at the graduate, were\nalways packed with enthusiastic students and colleagues. In spite of\nhis great distinction, he was modest and amusing in the classroom. He\nenjoyed engaging in animated critical discussion with students, and\nencouraged his students to present their questions and objections. In\nmany cases these questions led to revisions of the doctrines Chisholm\nhad presented. He was always pleased to receive good criticism, and\nshowed enormous creativity in producing revisions in his attempts to\novercome the problems. In his autobiography, Chisholm mentions how\ndelighted he was to have had such eager \u201crefuters\u201d in his\nclasses at Brown as well as at other places where he visited. For a\ntouching discussion of Chisholm\u2019s teaching style, see Taylor\n(1975) .\n\nChisholm directed about 59 doctoral dissertations, thus making him\nperhaps the third most prolific producer of philosophy PhDs in\nAmerican history. Many of his students went on to have distinguished\ncareers of their own. If we consider the class containing\nChisholm\u2019s students and the students of those students, it\nbecomes obvious that through his teaching, Chisholm influenced a\nremarkable number of philosophers. In addition, many of\nChisholm\u2019s colleagues and friends turned their attention to\nChisholm\u2019s work.\n\nChisholm published an extraordinary number of journal articles and\nreviews. A short discussion of some of the most important of these is\nincluded below in Section 13. He also edited, co-edited, and\ntranslated several works of others. Among the most important of the\nbooks written by Chisholm are: Perceiving: A Philosophical\nStudy [PPS], Theory of Knowledge ([TK1], [TK2], and\n[TK3] for first, second, and third editions), Person and Object: A\nMetaphysical Study [P&O], The First Person: An Essay on\nReference and Intentionality [FP], The Foundations of\nKnowing [FK], Brentano and Intrinsic Value [B&IV],\nOn Metaphysics [OM], and A Realistic Theory of\nCategories: An Essay on Ontology [RTC].\n\nChisholm received a remarkable array of academic honors and awards. He\nwas a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, President\nof the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association,\nPresident of the Metaphysical Society of America, and a member of many\nother distinguished councils and boards. He presented important\nlectures at Oxford, London, Stanford, and elsewhere. A volume of the\nLibrary of Living Philosophers is devoted to his work.\n\nAmong the books devoted to Chisholm are Analysis and\nMetaphysics (Lehrer 1975) [A&M], Roderick M.\nChisholm (Bogdan 1986) [RMCp], Essays on the Philosophy of\nRoderick M. Chisholm (Sosa 1979) [EPRMC], and The Philosophy\nof Roderick M. Chisholm (Hahn 1997) [LLP]. A special issue of the\njournal Metaphilosophy devoted entirely to Chisholm\u2019s\nwork was published in October of 2003.\n\nChisholm died in Providence, Rhode Island, in January of 1999.\nMemorial Minutes on Chisholm written by Ernest Sosa appeared in the\nProceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical\nAssociation in May of 1999. Chisholm\u2019s intellectual\nautobiography can be found in \u201cMy Philosophical\nDevelopment\u201d in [LLP]. An earlier version of his intellectual\nautobiography appears as the \u201cSelf-Profile\u201d in [RMCp].\nSome readers may be amused by Fred Feldman\u2019s Banquet Address\nfrom the Chisholm Memorial Conference held at Brown in November, 2000\nand available online (see Other Internet Resources).\n",
