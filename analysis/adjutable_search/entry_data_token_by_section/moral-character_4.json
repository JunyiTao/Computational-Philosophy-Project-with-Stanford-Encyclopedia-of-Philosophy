    "main_text": "Some ancient Greek views || Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE)\n2.4 Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE)\n\nAristotle accepts Plato\u2019s division of the soul into two basic\nparts (rational and non-rational) and agrees that both parts\ncontribute to virtuous character. Of all the Greek moralists,\nAristotle provides the most psychologically insightful account of\nvirtuous character. Because many modern philosophical treatments of\ncharacter (see Sections 3 and 4 below) are indebted to\nAristotle\u2019s analysis, it is best to discuss his position in some\ndetail.\nAristotle\u2019s definition of good moral character\n\nAristotle defines virtuous character in Nicomachean Ethics\nII.6: \n\nExcellence [of character], then, is a state concerned with choice,\nlying in a mean relative to us, this being determined by reason and in\nthe way in which the man of practical wisdom (phronimos)\nwould determine it. Now it is a mean between two vices, that which\ndepends on excess and that which depends on defect.\n(1106b36\u20131107a3)\n\n\nBy calling excellence of character a state, Aristotle means that it is\nneither a feeling nor a capacity nor a mere tendency to behave in\nspecific ways. Rather it is the settled condition we are in when we\nare well off in relation to feelings and actions. We are well off in\nrelation to our feelings and actions when we are in a mean or\nintermediate state in regard to them. If, on the other hand, we have a\nvicious character, we are badly off in relation to feelings and\nactions, and we fail to hit the mean in regard to them.\n\nSo it is not easy to hit the mean. \u201cAnyone can get angry \u2013\nthat is easy \u2013 or give or spend money; but to do this to the\nright person, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right\naim, and in the right way, that is not for everyone, nor is it\neasy.\u201d That is why goodness is praiseworthy (epaineton)\nand fine (kalon) (Nicomachean Ethics\n1109a26\u201330).\nVirtue as a mean state\n\nAristotle emphasizes that the mean state is not an arithmetic mean,\nbut one relative to the situation. The different particular virtues\nprovide illustrations of what Aristotle means. Each virtue is set over\nor concerned with specific feelings or actions. The virtue of mildness\nor good temper, for example, is concerned with anger. Aristotle thinks\nthat a mild person ought to be angry about some things (e.g.,\ninjustice and other forms of mistreatment) and should be willing to\nstand up for himself and those he cares about. Not to do so would, in\nAristotle\u2019s view, indicate the morally deficient character of\nthe inirascible person. It would also be inappropriate to take offense\nand get angry if there is nothing worth getting angry about. That\nresponse would indicate the morally excessive character of the\nirascible person. The mild person\u2019s reactions are appropriate to\nthe situation. Sometimes intense anger is appropriate; at other times\ncalm detachment is. \nThe psychological unity of the virtuous person and the disunity of non-virtuous conditions\n\nThat the virtuous person\u2019s emotional responses are appropriate\nto the situation indicates that her emotional responses are in harmony\nwith her correct reasoning about what to do. Aristotle says that the\nnon-rational part of a virtuous person\u2019s soul \u201cspeaks with\nthe same voice\u201d (homoph\u00f4nei, Nicomachean\nEthics 1102b28) as the rational part. That the virtuous\nperson\u2019s soul is unified and not torn by conflict distinguishes\nthe state of being virtuous from various non-virtuous conditions such\nas continence (enkrateia), incontinence (akrasia),\nand vice (kakia) in general. \n\nAristotle seems to think that, at bottom, any non-virtuous person is\nplagued by inner doubt or conflict, even if on the surface she appears\nto be as psychologically unified as virtuous people. Although a\nvicious person may appear to be single-minded about her disdain for\njustice and her pursuit of material goods and power, she must seek out\nothers\u2019 company to forget or ignore her own actions. Aristotle\nseems to have this point in mind when he says of vicious people in\nNicomachean Ethics IX.4 that they are at odds with themselves\nand do not love themselves. Virtuous persons, on the other hand, enjoy\nwho they are and take pleasure in acting virtuously.\n\nLike the morally vicious person, the continent and incontinent persons\nare internally conflicted, but they are more aware of their inner\nturmoil than the morally vicious person. Continence is essentially a\nkind of self-mastery: the continent person recognizes what she should\ndo and does it, but to do so she must struggle against the pull of\nrecalcitrant feelings. The incontinent person also in some way knows\nwhat she should do, but she fails to do it because of recalcitrant\nfeelings.\n\nAristotle\u2019s position on incontinence seems to incorporate both\nSocratic and Platonic elements. Recall that Socrates had explained\napparently incontinent behavior as the result of ignorance of what\nleads to the good. Since, he thought, everyone desires the good and\naims at it in his actions, no one would intentionally choose a course\nof action believed to yield less good overall. Plato, on the other\nhand, argued that incontinence can occur when a person\u2019s\nnon-rational desires move him to act in ways not endorsed by his\nrational desire for the greater good. Aristotle seems to agree with\nSocrates that the cognitive state of the incontinent person is\ndefective at the moment of incontinent behavior, but he also agrees\nwith Plato that a person\u2019s non-rational desires cause the\nincontinent action. This may be what Aristotle means when he writes\nthat \u201cthe position that Socrates sought to establish actually\nseems to result; for it is not what is thought to be knowledge proper\nthat the passion overcomes \u2026 but perceptual knowledge\u201d\n(Nicomachean Ethics, 1147b14\u201317).\nMoral education and the human function\n\nBecause Aristotle thinks that virtue is a unified, unconflicted state\nwhere emotional responses and rational assessments speak with the same\nvoice, he, like Plato, thinks that the education of our emotional\nresponses is crucial for the development of virtuous character. If our\nemotional responses are educated properly, we will learn to take\npleasure or pain in the right things. Like Plato, Aristotle thinks\nthat we can take a person\u2019s pleasures and pains to be a sign of\nhis state of character. \n\nTo explain what the virtuous person\u2019s pleasures are like,\nAristotle returns to the idea that virtue is an excellent state of the\nperson. Virtue is the state that makes a human being good and makes\nhim perform his function well (Nicomachean Ethics\n1106a15\u201324). His function (his ergon or characteristic\nactivity) is rational activity, so when we exercise our fully\ndeveloped rational powers well, when we realize our nature as rational\nbeings, we are good (virtuous) human beings and live well (we are\nhappy) (Nicomachean Ethics, I.7). \n\nAccording to Aristotle, human beings can reason in ways that non-human\nanimals cannot. They can deliberate about what to do, about what kind\nof lives to live, about what sort of persons to be. They can look for\nreasons to act or live one way rather than another. In other words,\nthey can engage in practical reasoning. They can also think about the\nnature of the world and why it seems to behave as it does. They can\nconsider scientific and metaphysical truths about the universe. This\nis to engage in theoretical reasoning (\u201ccontemplation\u201d or\nthe\u00f4ria). There is no agreement among scholars as to\nwhether, and how, these types of reasoning can be distinguished. (For\na discussion of theoretical and practical reason in Aristotle, see the\nrelated entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s ethics.)\n But as we shall see when we discuss Aristotle\u2019s\nPolitics, we can assume, for the purposes of this discussion,\nthat theoretical and practical rational activity are at least related\ntypes of rational activity, in that each involves exercising\none\u2019s abilities to think and to know and to consider truths that\none has figured out.\n\nHow do one realize these powers fully? Not by becoming adept at every\nkind of activity in which deliberating and judging on the basis of\nreason is called for. For then one would have to master every kind of\ncultural, scientific, and philosophical activity. Rather,\nAristotle\u2019s idea is that an individual develops these abilities\nto the extent that he enjoys and values the exercise of his realized\nrational powers in a wide variety of different and even seemingly\nunconnected activities. When that happens, his exercise of these\nabilities is a continuing source of self-esteem and enjoyment. He\ncomes to like his life and himself and is now a genuine self-lover\n(Nicomachean Ethics 1168b28\u20131169a3).\n\nIn Nicomachean Ethics) IX.8, Aristotle clarifies the motives\nand reasoning of virtuous people by contrasting genuine self-love with\na defective type that is reproachable. People with reproachable\nself-love want most to have the biggest share of money, honors, and\nbodily pleasures (cf. Nicomachean Ethics I.5). Because one\nperson cannot have a big share without denying these goods to others,\nthese are the goods that are contested and fought over. This\ncompetitive approach to these external goods leads to all sorts of\nmorally vicious behavior, for example, overreaching\n(pleonexia), aggression, wasteful luxury, intemperance,\nboastfulness, and vanity. In contrast to reproachable self-lovers,\ngenuine self-lovers will take pleasure in the right things (they will\nenjoy the exercise of their deliberative and decision-making powers\nrather than the accumulation of wealth or power). As a result, they\nwill avoid many of the actions, and will be unattracted to many of the\npleasures, of the common vices. Because they have the proper attitude\ntoward external goods, they will be ready to sacrifice such goods if\nby doing so they achieve what is fine. They recognize that when\neveryone concentrates on doing what is fine, their actions promote the\ncommon good (Nicomachean Ethics 1169a6). The virtuous\nperson\u2019s reasoning reflects his correct conception of how to\nlive (he has phron\u00easis or practical wisdom) and his\nconcern for the fine: he sees that his own good is included in the\ngood of the community (Nicomachean Ethics\n1169a3\u20136).\nThe need for relationships and community\n\nBecause an individual\u2019s good is included in the good of\ncommunity, the full realization of an individual\u2019s rational\npowers is not something he can achieve or maintain on his own. It is\nhard, Aristotle says in Nicomachean Ethics IX.9, for a\nsolitary person to be continuously active, but it is easier with\nothers. To realize our powers fully we need at least a group of\ncompanions who share our interests and with whom we can cooperate to\nachieve our mutually recognized goals. In this kind of cooperative\nactivity, we are parts of a larger enterprise, so that when others\nact, it is as though we are acting, too. In this way, these activities\nexpand our conception of who \u201cwe\u201d are, and they make the\nuse of our powers more continuous and more stable. Examples listed by\nAristotle include sailors on a ship, soldiers on an expedition,\nmembers of families, business relationships, religious associations,\ncitizens of a political community, and colleagues engaged in\ncontemplative activity. As Aristotle explains in Rhetoric\nII.4, if we and our cooperative partners do their parts responsibly,\neach will develop feelings of friendship for the others involved. In\nthis way, successful cooperative activity transforms persons\u2019\ndesires and motivations. Although we may have initiated activity for\nself-interested reasons, the psychological result is that we come to\nlike our cooperative partners and to develop a concern for their good\nfor their own sakes. This change, Aristotle indicates, is caused to\noccur in us. It is not chosen. Once bonds of friendship are formed, it\nis natural for us to exhibit the social virtues Aristotle describes in\nNicomachean Ethics IV.6\u20138, which include generosity,\nfriendliness, and mildness of temper. \n\nAristotle thinks that, in addition to friendships, wider social\nrelations are required for the full development of our rational\npowers. He says in Nicomachean Ethics I.7 that we are by\nnature political beings, whose capacities are fully realized in a\nspecific kind of political community (a polis or city-state).\nAristotle\u2019s ideal political community is led by citizens who\nrecognize the value of living fully active lives and whose aim is to\nmake the best life possible for their fellow citizens, thereby\npromoting the common good (Politics 1278b19\u201326, cf.\n1280b8\u201312). When citizens deliberate and legislate about the\ncommunity\u2019s educational, office-holding, and economic policies,\ntheir goal is to determine and promote the conditions under which\ncitizens can fully develop their deliberative and decision-making\npowers (Politics 1332b12\u201341).\n\nThus Aristotle recommends in Politics VII-VIII that the city\nprovide a system of public education for all citizens, a\nrecommendation that was radical for his time. He envisions that young\npeople will learn not simply to read and write, but also to appreciate\nthe beauty of the world around them and to gain some understanding of\nhow the universe works. If education is successful, young people will\nwant to use their powers in deciding, judging, and discriminating.\nThey will then be well-positioned to take their place as\ndecision-makers in the citizen assembly and judicial system and,\nbecause of sortition and a system of office rotation, as eventual\nholders of public office. The city\u2019s economic policies support\nthe aim of the political and educational institutions. Because\nAristotle sees that citizens need material resources if they are to\nparticipate fully in public life, he recommends that the state\ndistribute parcels of land to all. Yet there is no need, in his view,\nto establish economic equality, as long as existing inequalities are\nnot large enough to promote the formation of elite groups or to\nprovoke justified anger or envy. These various policies \u2013\neducational, political, economic \u2013 make it possible for a sense\nof justice to pervade the city, as they serve to confirm that all\ncitizens are valued as equal practical deliberators and\npolicy-makers.\n\nAristotle\u2019s criticisms of deviant political states take a\nrelated line: states that encourage the consumption and accumulation\nof external goods for their own sake, or states that promote warfare\nand military supremacy as an end in itself, mistake the nature of the\nbest human life. Citizens of such states will grow up to love most\nsomething other than the exercise of realized human rational powers,\nand as a result they will be prone to such traditional vices as\ninjustice, lack of generosity, and intemperance. \n\nThat living well requires active political deliberation and\npolicy-making explains why Aristotle excludes natural slaves, women,\nand manual workers from citizenship, and helps to clarify his view\nthat citizens should be private property-owners. In Aristotle\u2019s\nview, natural slaves lack the capacity for deliberation and\ndecision-making that is required for living well. Women have a\ndeliberative capacity, but it is not \u201cauthoritative.\u201d\nManual laborers are occupied with the production of necessities. They\nhave decision-making powers, but their exercise is limited by the\nlaborer\u2019s need to survive, for he must conform to the demands of\nhis working conditions. Moreover, manual work is often dull and\nrepetitive, making little demand on workers\u2019 rational powers.\nAs private property-owners, citizens are not vulnerable to these\nproblems. With private property, an individual has a supply of\nresources that is under his control; his decision determines what\nhappens to it. Thus he is able to take pleasure from generous action\n\u2013 from helping his friends, guests, and companions.\n\nFor more detailed discussion of the relation between Aristotle\u2019s\nethical and political views, see Irwin (1985, 1996, 2007), Kraut\n(2002) and Schofield (2006). On Aristotle\u2019s discussions of\nfriendship, see Cooper (1980). \nSummary\n\nPlato and Aristotle agree that excellent moral character involves more\nthan a Socratic understanding of the good. They think that virtue\nrequires a harmony between cognitive and affective elements of the\nperson. Aristotle tries to explain what this harmony consists in by\nexploring the psychological foundations of moral character. He thinks\nthat the virtuous person is characterized by a nonstereotypical\nself-love that he understands as a love of the exercise of fully\nrealized rational activity. Yet this self-love is not an individual\nachievement. Its development and preservation require (a) friendships\nin which individuals desire the good of others for others\u2019 own\nsakes and (b) a political community where citizens are equal and\nsimilar, and where political and economic arrangements promote the\nconditions under which self-love and friendship flourish. \n",
