    "main_text": "Arguments against PAP || The Irrelevance of Determinism\n3.1 The Irrelevance of Determinism\n\nAs noted earlier\n (\u00a72.2),\n it looks as if PAP is supported by our ordinary practices of praise\nand blame. In particular, those who could not avoid what they\u2019ve\ndone are excused. But despite these initial appearances, ordinary\npractices might end up undermining the principle.\n\nConsider again causal determinism, a thesis often thought to rule out\nalternatives. Determinism is a substantive empirical claim, and no\none, certainly no ordinary person, knows whether it\u2019s true (see\nentry on\n causal determinism).\n It appears, then, that if we presuppose PAP in ordinary life, we\nshould for the time being withhold judgment on whether any person is\nresponsible for her actions, cautiously awaiting a verdict from\nscientists on the question of determinism. But, the argument goes, it\nwould be absurd to think we have to wait for scientific progress to\ndecide whether, say, Kevin should be grateful to Denise for picking up\nhis mail when he was on vacation, or a victim of fraud should blame\nthe con artist. These and similar reactions are justified however\nthings turn out in the recherch\u00e9 domain of\nmicro-physics. Determinism\u2019s threatened block of alternatives is\nirrelevant to whether someone should be praised or blamed (P. F.\nStrawson 1962; Dennett 1984b: ch. 6; Fischer 2006: 5).\n\nIn reply, PAP\u2019s defenders might take a cue from contextualists\nand say that in ordinary contexts, determinism is routinely (and\nproperly) ignored. This would explain why micro-physics never appears\nin ordinary thinking about responsibility, but in a way compatible\nwith our recognizing PAP\u2019s truth: if determinism were to become\nsalient\u2014as it is in philosophical and scientific\ncontexts\u2014its block of alternatives would cause us to\nretract our ordinary judgments (cp. Hawthorne 2001). Another option is\nto say that we ordinarily assume\u2014even if we don\u2019t yet\nknow\u2014that determinism is false (Wiggins 1973: \u00a78), and with\nthis we normally take ourselves to have alternatives. Perhaps if we\nbecame determinists, we would stop our practices of praise and blame,\nor at least stop thinking they were justified, precisely because we\nendorse PAP or some closely related principle. There is a growing\nexperimental literature on whether we would attribute moral\nresponsibility under the explicit assumption of determinism, but the\nresults so far seem to be mixed (Sommers 2010; Nichols 2015: ch.\n4).\n",
