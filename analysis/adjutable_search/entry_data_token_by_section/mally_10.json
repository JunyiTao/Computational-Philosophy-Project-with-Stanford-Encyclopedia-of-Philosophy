    "main_text": "Ethics: Norms and Values || .4 Trends in Mally\u2019s ethics after 1926/27\n4. Philosophy and National Socialist Ideology\n\n\nAfter the end of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy 1918, Mally became a\nmember of the Gro\u00dfdeutsche Volkspartei, a German\nnational and mostly anti-semitic party in the Austrian parliament,\nwhich agitated, like Sch\u00f6nerer and his followers, for Austria\u2019s\nannexation to Germany. In February 1938, Mally joined\nthe Volkspolitisches Referat, an organisation with the goal\nto unite all Austrian nationalist movements (including the National\nSocialists). The same year he also entered the NS Lehrerbund\n(National Socialist Teachers\u2019 Association).  Two months after the\nannexation of Austria by Germany in March 1938, Mally became a member\nof the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers Party), i.e., the Nazi\nparty. Given all this political involvement in Austria\u2019s and later\nGermany\u2019s national movements, the question has been legitimately\nraised whether and how his political attitude influenced his\nphilosophical work. It seems to be appropriate to pursue this question\nand some answers to it in its historical development.\n\n\nFirst, it is interesting how the Nazis themselves classified Mally\u2019s\nphilosophical work with respect to their ideology.  According to their\njudgment of the political reliability of philosophy professors in\nGermany (then including Austria) by the\nReichssicherheitsdienst of the Reichsf\u00fchrer SS,\nthere were six groups:\n\n\nDenominationally bound philosophers;\nLiberal philosophers; \nIndifferent philosophers; \nPolitically positive philosophers; \nNational Socialist philosophers;\nPositive junior scholars (Nachwuchskr\u00e4fte).\n\n(Korotin 2007: 8; translation by the authors)\n\n\nMally was ranked in group 2 and thus categorized as\n\u201cliberal\u201d, which here meant \u201cneither national\nsocialist nor system dependent\u201d according to Korotin (2007:\n8). The term \u2018liberal\u2019 was used by the Nazis for German\nnationalists who were not considered to be National Socialists.\n\n\nSecond, after World War II, no one seemed to have serious concerns\nabout Mally\u2019s philosophical work (or even just parts of it) in view of\nhis political attitude. In 1971, a collection of essays (including\nGro\u00dfes Logikfragment and Grundgesetze des\nSollens) was edited by Karl Wolf and Paul Weingartner, with\nintroductory comments by the editors as well as by Hans Mokre. It was\nonly in the 1990s when a critical and serious discussion of the\nquestion how Mally\u2019s political views influenced his philosophical work\nbegan.\n\n\nThird, Sauer 1998 claimed that Mally\u2019s National Socialist views\nclearly shaped his philosophical writings. Sauer provides a number of\nquotes from, and references to, Mally\u2019s writings and private\ncorrespondence, as well as a critical evaluation. He condemns Mally\u2019s\nentire later philosophical work as not being worthy of any further\ninvestigation. Thus Sauer challenged the philosophical community to\nseriously investigate all of Mally\u2019s work, including some of his\nunpublished manuscripts and personal correspondence. Sch\u00f6nafinger 1994\ncomes to similar results, based on previously unpublished work by\nSauer and referencing to personal documents and lecture notes in the\narchives of the Graz University Library. In 2008, Sagheb-Oehlinger\ndevoted her entire master\u2019s thesis to this problem. She analyzed\nthoroughly all \u201clater\u201d philosophical writings of Mally by\nproviding ten categories like racism, anti-semitism, cult of\nthe F\u00fchrer, anti-democratic, National Socialist education,\netc. In addition she studied Mally\u2019s private correspondence with his\nphilosophical \u201csoulmate\u201d and pen friend, Gertraud Laurin,\nwhich extended over a period of ten years\n(1934\u20131944). Sagheb-Oehlinger\u2019s final result can be summed up\nthe following way: Mally cannot clearly be seen a \u201cNational\nSocialist philosopher\u201d, but there is no doubt about the national\nsocialist ideological content of his Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der\nPhilosophie (1938a) (Sagheb-Oehlinger 2008: 143). This is\ndifferent from what Sauer (1998) had concluded. To give just one\nexample, in his description of Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Philosophie\n(Mally 1938a) Sauer names the two National Socialist main values\nemphasized in Mally\u2019s book, the \u201cbasic value of blood\u201d and\nthe \u201cduty to keep the race clean and breed it higher\u201d\n(Sauer 1998: 184). He then continues:\n\nWith one brief word, the\nphilosophical placet is granted to the whole barbaric madness of the\nracist legislation and racist separation, of the legislation of\nhereditary health and the forced sterilization in huge numbers of\ninsane people (or what was identified as such) and social\nnonconformists. (Sauer 1998: 184)\n\n Whilst it is correct that Mally (in\nMally 1938a) certainly supported this ideology that led to these\natrocities, Sauer\u2019s general conclusion that all of Mally\u2019s late\nphilosophy stands in one row with the works of all the other Nazi\nphilosophers is questionable. Also his concluding question whether\nthere remains anything of Mally\u2019s philosophy worth to be saved finds\nits positive answer in the preceding sections. For more details see the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n\n\nFinally, considering these opposing views, we want to give our own\nadditional assessment of Mally\u2019s philosophical writings with respect to\nhis national socialist involvement. Though Mally was an analytic,\nscientifically oriented philosopher who produced original contributions\nin various fields of philosophy, it is a fact that National Socialist\nideas and principles inspired some of his later philosophical works. He\npresents us with a case where, in certain parts of his work, it is not\neasy to separate his private political convictions from the content.\nNevertheless, it is important to stress that many of Mally\u2019s works are\nfree from any untoward political influences, and their philosophical\nvalue should in no way be diminished by his political views. But, of\ncourse, there are works that do contain National Socialist ideology. We\nwill outline the grades of National Socialist involvement in Mally\u2019s\nwork below, but first we present a short sketch of Mally\u2019s central\nNationalist Socialist (NS) theses.\n\n\nIn NS ideology, the concept of das Volk (the people),\nespecially das deutsche Volk (the German people), plays a\ncentral role. From the early 1930s on, Mally tried to provide a\nphilosophical justification for the value judgments (1) that das\nVolk is more important than its individual members, and (2) that\nthe Germans constitute the dominant people. He further stated an\nanti-reduction thesis, namely, that the concept of das Volk\ncannot be reduced to the concepts of each of its members (the\nindividual persons). He thus wanted to\n\n\u201cfight against\nsubjectivist, Jewish-positivist and related doctrines \u2026 and\nreplace them by something healthier\u201d. (From Mally\u2019s curriculum\nvit\u00e6, dated September 23, 1938, six months after the Anschluss;\nunpublished, University of Graz Library/Nachlass-Sammlung. This is,\nhowever, not a philosophical work but can rather be seen as an\nopportunistic self-description).\n\nThis fact also explains why Mally saw himself in opposition to the\nVienna Circle and the logical positivists, who he thought of as being\nthe prime exponents of the \u201cindividualist\nideology\u201d\u2014an ideology which (according to Mally) tries to\ndeprive the world of its meaning (Sinn).  Mally saw das\nVolk as a \u201cquasi-person\u201d, having a body, a mind, and\na soul; das Volk cannot be completely rationally\ncomprehended, it rather has to be experienced (erlebt). He\nmaintains that the \u201cessential reality\u201d of das\nVolk is revealed through this experience, i.e., its meaning, and\nthus, the meaning of its \u201cdynamic development\u201d is\nrevealed. Furthermore, different V\u00f6lker (peoples) have\ndifferent properties, depending on their origin, their development,\nculture, etc. These properties allegedly yield a significantly moral\ndifference: the German people are supposed to rank among the peoples\nwith the highest value and have therefore to be kept\n\u201cpure\u201d. External influences have to be eliminated, so that\ndas deutsche Volk can be \u201cbred\u201d to even higher\nstates of development, and thus gradually strive towards a state where\nits meaning can be totally fulfilled (see Mally 1934b, 1935 and\n1938a).\n From any reasonable perspective today, all his NS\n\u201ctheses\u201d are either barely understandable, or simply\nfalse.  Obviously, his allegations reflect Nazi ideology. In any case,\nmuch of what we find in the writings just described has nothing to do\nwith serious and solid philosophy. If we summarize the NS involvement\nin Mally\u2019s writings between 1904 and 1944, we may distinguish three\ndifferent grades, not in chronological order. Grade 1 is\n\u201cNS-ideology free\u201d. These are purely philosophical\nwritings such as Mally 1904, 1912, 1923, 1926, and 1938b.  In grade 2,\nwe count philosophical writings partially interpretable by, and\napplicable to, Nazi ideology, such as Mally 1935 and 1940.  Finally,\nwe can count as grade 3 the pure Nazi propaganda in articles or\npamphlets such as Mally 1934b and 1938a. For an assessment of Mally\u2019s\nphilosophical involvement in NS-ideology, see also Roschitz 2016b,\nch.7, 143\u2013157.\n\n\nAs we have shown above, Mally\u2019s logical as well as ontological\nideas, concepts and theories are still being discussed in contemporary\nphilosophical research. His value theory and ethical philosophy,\nhowever, are largely unknown and deserve widespread attention as his\nviews are diametrically opposed to what is generally accepted today.\nMoreover, this short overview should make clear that there are many\nparts in Mally\u2019s writings that deserve serious further philosophical\ninvestigation.\n",
