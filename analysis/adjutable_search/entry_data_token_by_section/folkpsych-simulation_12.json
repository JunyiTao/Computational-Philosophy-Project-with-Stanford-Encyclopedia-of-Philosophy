    "main_text": "The Role of Mental Simulation in Mindreading || Mindreading without Judgement\n4.3 Mindreading without Judgement \n\nThe main strategy adopted by the advocates of the Constitution View in\nresponding to the Anti-Constitution argument consists in impugning the\nidentification of mindreading events with events of judging\nthat someone else has a certain mental state. A prominent version of\nthis position is Gordon\u2019s (1995, 1996) Radical\nSimulationism, according to which representing someone\nelse\u2019s mental states does not require the formation of\njudgments involving the application of mentalistic\nconcepts. Rather, Gordon proposes that the main bulk of\nmindreading events are non-conceptual representations of\nothers\u2019 mental states, where these non-conceptual\nrepresentations are constituted by mental simulation events. If this\nis true, many mindreading events are constituted by mental\nsimulation events, and thus the Constitution View is correct.\n\nThe following case should help to get Radical Simulationism across.\nSuppose that I want to represent the mental state that an\nindividual\u2014call him \u201cMr Tees\u201d\u2014is in right now.\nAccording to Gordon, there is a false assumption behind the idea that,\nin order to do so, I need to form a judgment with the content Mr\nTees is in M (where \u201cM\u201d is a\nplaceholder for a mentalistic concept). The false assumption is that\nthe only thing that I can do is to simulate myself in Mr\nTees\u2019s situation. As Gordon points out, it is also possible for\nme to simulate Mr Tees in his situation. And if I do so, my\nvery simulation of Mr Tees constitutes a representation of\nhis mental state, without the need of forming any judgment. This is\nhow Gordon makes his point:\n\n\nTo simulate Mr Tees in his situation requires an egocentric shift, a\nrecentering of my egocentric map on Mr Tees. He becomes in my\nimagination the referent of the first person pronoun \u201cI\u201d.\n\u2026 Such recentering is the prelude to transforming myself in\nimagination into Mr Tees as much as actors become the characters they\nplay. \u2026 But once a personal transformation has been\naccomplished, \u2026 I am already representing him as being\nin a certain state of mind. (Gordon 1995: 55\u201356)\n\n\nIt is important to stress the dramatic difference between\nGordon\u2019s Radical Simulationism and Goldman\u2019s Three-Stage\nModel. According to the latter, mental simulation events causally\ncontribute to representing other people\u2019s mental states,\nbut the mindreading event proper is always constituted by a\njudgment (or a belief). Moreover, Goldman maintains that the ability\nto form such judgments requires both the capacity to\nintrospect one\u2019s own mental states (more in this in\n section 4.4)\n and possession of mentalistic concepts. None of this is true\nof Radical Simulationism. Rather, Gordon proposes that, in the large\nmajority of cases, it is the very mental simulation event itself that\nconstitutes a representation of someone else\u2019s mental\nstates. Furthermore, since such mental simulation events neither\nrequire the capacity for introspection nor possession of mentalistic\nconcepts, Radical Simulationism entails the surprising conclusion that\nthese two features play at best a very minor role in mindreading. A\ntestable corollary is that social interaction often relies on an\nunderstanding of others that does not require the explicit application\nof mental state concepts.\n",
