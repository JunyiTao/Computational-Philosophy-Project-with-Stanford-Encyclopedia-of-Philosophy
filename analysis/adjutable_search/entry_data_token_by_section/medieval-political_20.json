    "main_text": "Marsilius of Padua\n12. Marsilius of Padua\n\nAnother upsurge in writing about politics was prompted by the actions\nof Pope John XXII (r. 1316\u201334). John\u2019s opponents included\nMarsilius of Padua and William of Ockham. Pope John rejected the\nFranciscan doctrine that those who practice the highest form of\nreligious poverty, like Christ and the Apostles, will own nothing\nwhatever, either as individuals or as a body. Relying on arguments\ndrawn from the civil law, John held that no one can justly use\nconsumables, such as food, without owning what they use. Since no one\ncan live without using things, at least food, no one can justly live\nwithout property, as the Franciscans claimed to do (Robinson 2012:\n29ff.; Miethke 2012). John also became involved in conflict with\nLudwig of Bavaria. Relying on the papal claim that the emperor-elect\nrequires papal approval, John rejected the electors\u2019 choice of\nLudwig as Roman Emperor (see\n \u00a78;\n Lambertini 2012).\n\nMarsilius of Padua\u2019s Defensor pacis\n (1324)[62]\n set out to refute the doctrine of papal fullness of power and, in\nparticular, to prove that the pope is not the source of government\npower. He argues that all coercive power comes from the people\n(44\u20139, 61\u20133/65\u201372, 88\u201390), and that no people\ncan have more than one supreme ruler, who is the source of all\ncoercive power in that community (80\u20136/114\u201322). (Marsilius\nis the first exponent of the doctrine of sovereignty later put forward\nby Hobbes and many others, i.e., the doctrine that there must be\nultimately just one coercive power in a state.) The supreme ruler\ncannot be a cleric, since Christ has forbidden the clergy to become\ninvolved in temporal affairs (113\u201340/159\u201392). And the\nsupreme ruler does not enforce divine law as such, since God wills\nthat divine law should be enforced by sanctions only in the next\nworld, to give every opportunity for repentance before death (164,\n175\u20139/221, 235\u20139). The supreme ruler is therefore not an\nenforcer of religion and his rule is not subject to direction by the\nclergy. Within the Church, the pope has from Christ no more authority\nthan any other cleric. Christ did not appoint Peter as head of the\nChurch, Peter never went to Rome, the bishop of Rome is not\nPeter\u2019s successor as head of the Church (44\u20139/61\u20133).\nAs for religious poverty, Marsilius sides with the Franciscans and\ntakes their doctrine further: not only is it legitimate for religious\nto live entirely without ownership of property (they can use what they\nneed with the owner\u2019s permission), but this is what Christ\nintended for all the clergy (183\u20134, 196\u2013215/244\u20136,\n262\u201386). Thus on his view the pope and clergy should have no\nlordship at all, either in the sense of coercive jurisdiction or in\nthe sense of ownership of property. His position is diametrically\nopposite that of Giles of Rome.\n\nMarsilius did believe that the Church exercised some authority over\nits members, but, so far as this was a doctrinal authority, it was\nexercised not by the pope but by a general council (Marsilius held\nthat the Bible and general councils are infallible, but not the pope\n(274\u20139/360\u201366)). Now that Europe is Christian a general\ncouncil cannot be convened or its decisions enforced except by the\nChristian lay ruler (287\u201398/376\u201390). The establishment of\na hierarchy and the division of the Church into bishoprics and other\nacts of Church government are also done by authority of the lay ruler.\nRather than secular government being subordinated to the Church, the\nChurch is subordinated to the secular government in all that concerns\ncoercive\n power.[63]\n\n",
