    "main_text": "Causality and Cosmology || Emanation: Celestial Intelligences, Souls and Bodies\n5.4 Emanation: Celestial Intelligences, Souls and Bodies\n\nAvicenna explains the creation of the world with an idea he adopted\nfrom Arabic Neo-Platonic writings: emanation, in Arabic\nfay\u1e0d (literally \u201cflow\u201d; cf. the Latin\nfluxus; Hasnawi 1990), which, like the Greek\naporrein originally indicated the flow of water from a\nsource. By virtue of an act of thought which is outside time and\ntotally auto-reflective\u2014the First Principle is Itself\nintelligence, as well as subject and object of intellection:\n\u02bfaql, \u02bf\u0101qil and ma\u02bfq\u016bl\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 6, 357, 3\u201312; cf. Arist.,\nMetaph., XII (\u039b) 7, 9)\u2014a thinking entity is\nderived from the First Principle: an intellect or intelligence\n(\u02bfaql) which is both the objectification of the\nintellection of the Principle and an active subject of thought. To the\nextent that is possible for a caused entity (which is in itself\nrelative), this first emanated intelligence is \u201cone\u201d\n(\u201cfrom the one, insofar as it is one, comes only one\u201d:\nex uno non fit nisi unum; Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX,\n4, 405, 13\u201314; cf. IX, 5, 411, 1, 5\u20136;\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t, III, ed. Duny\u0101, 95\u2013102;\ncf. Ta\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t, 97, 12\u201313). Nevertheless,\nunlike the Principle, which is absolutely simple, this first caused\nintelligence is already a complex existence. The reason for its\nexistence lies in fact not only in itself\u2014as in the case of the\nFirst Principle\u2014but in itself (in its possibility) and in the\nFirst Principle\u2019s act of thinking, which makes it necessary:\nthis first created intelligence is therefore twofold.\n\nIndeed the intrinsic duality of the first caused intelligence exhibits\nboth the structure of the universe (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I,\n7, 47, 18\u201319) and, at the same time, the reason the universe\nunfolds: if the First Principle\u2019s thought can only be simple and\nauto-reflective, that of the first caused intelligence is already a\ncomplex thought. This first caused intelligence has not only two\npossible objects of thought (its Principle and itself); it also has a\nthought of itself, which is in turn complex: it reflects the duality\nof its own being, in which essence and existence (and therefore\npossibility and necessity) are to be distinguished. Hence the first\ncaused intelligence thinks of the First Principle and then proceeds in\nits auto-intellection according to a descent which, as in a mirror,\nreflects (thus showing it in reverse), the ontological order of\ncausality: the intelligence thinks first of all of its existence or\nactualization (its necessity per aliud) and then recognizes\nits potential foundation (its essence as possible). The effect of this\narticulation is consequently triple (\u201cfrom every intelligence\nthree things follow\u201d: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 4, 406\n11\u201315): \n\nfrom the act by which the first caused intelligence thinks of the\nFirst Principle and aims at it, a further intelligence originates;\nfrom the act by which it thinks of itself and aims at itself, two\nentities originate: \na soul, which is an intelligence bound to a body and which is, in\nsome texts, equated to the practical intellect\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 387, 4\u20137); and \nthe celestial body to which this intelligence is bound.\n\n\nClearly, the consequence of the immediacy of the divine act is the\nnecessity of the series: only one caused element can derive directly\nfrom the absolutely unique Principle. Multiplicity is produced by\nmediation and the product of divine causality is divided between what\nis created directly (and is necessarily one) and what is created by\nway of mediation. With his emanative doctrine, Avicenna thus maintains\nthe idea of the absolute causation of being and simultaneously\nestablishes two distinct kinds of effects: those that correspond to\nthe intermediate (mutawassi\u1e6d), which is caused without\nmediation, and those that are like the last caused thing\n(ma\u02bfl\u016bl), which is caused by virtue of the\nintermediate and is only an effect. In Avicenna\u2019s emanative\nscheme, the first effects correspond to the celestial entities (and,\nstrictly speaking, only to the first one, which is caused or\n\u201cinstaured\u201d or absolutely created: al-mubda\u02bf\nal-awwal); the following ones are, roughly speaking, all the\neffects (and, strictly speaking, the sublunary effects).\n\nThis pattern also explains the relations among the different causal\nseries: as is the case in the Neo-Platonic tradition Avicenna divides\nthe four Aristotelian causes into internal and external as regards the\nthing of which they are causes (Jolivet 1991; Bertolacci 2002;\nWisnovsky 2003b); thus he inserts them in a hierarchy\n(cause-intermediate-caused) that places the intermediate term above\nthe last effect, but below the absolute cause. In the sublunary world,\nfor example, the form is part of the cause of matter and is superior\nto it, because it is an intermediate in the causal relation that binds\nmatter (the last caused thing) to the intelligence\u2014the dator\nformarum\u2014 from which both form and matter result\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, II, 4, 87, 13\u201389, 15; VI, 1, 259,\n7\u201310). Moreover, the effects that are caused without mediation\nare absolutely created (or \u201cinstaured\u201d) and immaterial and\nconsequently defined only by the ontological composition of the\npossibility of their essence and the necessity of their existence;\nthose that are caused by virtue of a mediation are defined by virtue\nof their ontological composition (possibility and necessity; existence\ndistinct from essence), but also by virtue of the composition that is\nconsequent to the mediation: they are material entities, composed of\nmatter and form. In this sense the whole of the cosmos is explained:\nthe intelligences (al-\u02bfuq\u016bl) that are caused\ndirectly by the Necessarily Existent (properly speaking only the first\nof them); the entities originated by virtue of the intellection of the\nfirst intelligences: the souls (al-nuf\u016bs) and the\nheavenly bodies (al-a\u01e7r\u0101m al-sam\u0101wiyya). Both\nof these have an influence on the sublunary world and\u2014like the\ncelestial intelligences\u2014are sometimes called\n\u201cangels\u201d in religious terms (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t,\nX, 1); they are followed by the world of simple effects: the beings of\nthe sublunary world. \n\nIndeed the intellectual process is welded to cosmology (in which the\nPtolemaic system is painstakingly harmonized with Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, Book \u039b and De Caelo). The whole\nof the heavens is explained in terms of emanation or flow. In some\ntexts, Avicenna mentions \u201cten intelligences after the\nFirst\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 3, 401, 9\u201312):\nthe Heavens\u2014the outermost orb, and the orb of the fixed stars,\nand then Saturn, and so on, up to and including, according to the\ntraditional scheme, the animated spheres of Jupiter, Mars, the Sun,\nVenus, Mercury and the Moon\u2014are bound to the intelligences. The\nearth is at the center. Theology, metaphysics, cosmology and\n(celestial) noetic seem fused with one another.\n\nThe noetic process also explains the multiplicity of intelligibles:\nthe Aristotelian idea of the First Principle as noesis\nnoeseos is interpreted by means of Themistius\u2019 idea of Its\nknowing all things through Itself (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII,\n6, 359, 15\u2013360, 10; Commentaire Lambda: 13; Pines 1987;\nBertolacci 2006), but in the Principle\u2019s thinking the multiple\nis intellected as a \u201cwhole\u201d and \u201cat once\u201d and\nappears to be reduced to something unique (to one\nintelligible). Thus, its order (tart\u012bb), the syllogistic\nconcatenation of intellection that corresponds to reality, is a\nconsequent of divine intellection and is in a sense relocated from the\nthought of the First Principle to that of its immediate effects\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 362, 17\u2013366). \n",
