    "main_text": "Defining Expected Utility\n1. Defining Expected Utility\n\n\nThe concept of expected utility is best illustrated by\nexample. Suppose I am planning a long walk, and need to decide whether\nto bring my umbrella. I would rather not tote the umbrella on a sunny\nday, but I would rather face rain with the umbrella than without\nit. There are two acts available to me: taking my umbrella, and\nleaving it at home. Which of these acts should I choose?\n\n\nThis informal problem description can be recast, slightly more\nformally, in terms of three sorts of entities. First, there are\noutcomes\u2014objects of non-instrumental preferences.  In\nthe example, we might distinguish three outcomes: either I end up dry\nand unencumbered; I end up dry and encumbered by an unwieldy umbrella;\nor I end up wet. Second, there are states\u2014things\noutside the decision-maker\u2019s control which influence the outcome of\nthe decision. In the example, there are two states: either it is\nraining, or it is not.  Finally, there are acts\u2014objects\nof the decision-maker\u2019s instrumental preferences, and in some sense,\nthings that she can do. In the example, there are two acts: I may\neither bring the umbrella; or leave it at home. Expected utility\ntheory provides a way of ranking the acts according to how\nchoiceworthy they are: the higher the expected utility, the\nbetter it is to choose the act. (It is therefore best to choose the\nact with the highest expected utility\u2014or one of them, in the\nevent that several acts are tied.)\n\n\nFollowing general convention, I will make the following assumptions\nabout the relationships between acts, states, and outcomes.\n\nStates, acts, and outcomes are propositions, i.e., sets of\npossibilities. There is a maximal set of possibilities, \\(\\Omega\\), of\nwhich each state, act, or outcome is a subset.\nThe set of acts, the set of states, and the set of outcomes are\nall partitions on \\(\\Omega\\). In other words, acts and states are\nindividuated so that every possibility in \\(\\Omega\\) is one where exactly\none state obtains, the agent performs exactly one act, and exactly one\noutcome ensues. \nActs and states are logically independent, so that no state rules\nout the performance of any act.\nI will assume for the moment that, given a state of the world,\neach act has exactly one possible outcome. (Section 1.1 briefly\ndiscusses how one might weaken this assumption.)\n\n\n\nSo the example of the umbrella can be depicted in the following\nmatrix, where each column corresponds to a state of the world; each row\ncorresponds to an act; and each entry corresponds to the outcome that\nresults when the act is performed in the state of the world.\n\n\n\nstates\n\n\nit rains\nit does not rain\n\n\nacts\ntake umbrella\nencumbered, dry\nencumbered, dry\n\n\nleave umbrella\nwet\nfree, dry\n\n\n\n\nHaving set up the basic framework, I can now rigorously define\nexpected utility. The expected utility of an act \\(A\\) (for\ninstance, taking my umbrella) depends on two features of the\nproblem:\n\nThe value of each outcome, measured by a real number called a\nutility.\nThe probability of each outcome conditional on \\(A\\).\n\n\n\nGiven these three pieces of information, \\(A\\)\u2019s expected\nutility is defined as:\n\n\\[\nEU(A) = \\sum_{o \\in O} P_{A}(o) U(o)\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere \\(O\\) is is the set of outcomes,\n\\(P_{A}(o)\\) is the probability of outcome \\(o\\) conditional on \\(A\\), and \n\\(U(o)\\) is the utility of \\(o\\).\n\n\nThe next two subsections will unpack the conditional probability\nfunction \\(P_A\\) and the utility function \\(U\\).\n",
