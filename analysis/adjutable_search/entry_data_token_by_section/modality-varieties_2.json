    "main_text": "Epistemic and Metaphysical Modality || Dualism\n1.2 Dualism\n\nDualists distinguish between two concepts of propositional necessity,\nmetaphysically necessity and epistemic necessity.\nThe two notions are not coextensive. At least some of the sentences in\nKripke\u2019s examples express propositions that possess the one kind\nof necessity but not the\n other.[4]\n\nOnce the existence of a distinctively metaphysical form of\npropositional necessity is accepted, it is natural to wonder whether\nit is possible to say more about its nature. Kit Fine (1994) offers an\naccount of it that appeals to the traditional distinction between\nthose properties of a thing that it possesses by its very nature and\nthose that it has merely accidentally. For example, it lies in the\nnature of water to be composed of hydrogen and oxygen\u2014being\ncomposed in this way is part of what it is to be water\u2014but it is\nmerely accidental to water that we use it to brush our teeth. A\nproposition is metaphysically necessary just in case it is true in\nvirtue of the natures of things. (Also see Kment 2014, chs. 6\u20137,\nand Ditter 2020.) Other philosophers (Rayo 2013, \u00a72.2.1, ch.\n5; Dorr 2016) have discussed the idea that metaphysical necessity can\nbe explained in terms of the idiom \u201cTo be \\(F\\) is to be\n\\(G\\)\u201d (as in \u201cTo be water is to be\nH2O\u201d). Yet another account ties the metaphysical\nnotion of necessity constitutively to causation and explanation (Kment\n2006a,b, 2014, 2015a; also see the exchange between Lange 2015 and\nKment 2015b).\n\nDualism requires us to dismantle the picture of inquiry, information\nand content sketched in the introduction to\n section 1.\n Note that it is natural for a dualist to distinguish the space of\nmetaphysically possible worlds from the space of\nepistemically possible worlds, i.e., from the space of\n(maximally specific) ways the world might be that cannot be ruled out\non the basis of ideal reasoning alone, without empirical evidence\n(Soames 2005, 2011). The range of epistemically possible worlds\noutstrips the range of metaphysically possible worlds: there are some\nways the world couldn\u2019t have been, but which cannot be ruled by\nideal reasoning alone. For example, there is no metaphysically\npossible world where gold has atomic number 78. But prior to carrying\nout the right chemical investigations, we don\u2019t have enough\nevidence to exclude all scenarios where gold has that atomic number,\nso some worlds where gold has atomic number 78 are epistemically\npossible. Empirical evidence is not used only to rule out\n(metaphysical) possibilities, but is sometimes needed to rule out\nmetaphysical impossibilities that are epistemically possible.\nConsequently, we cannot in general identify information with sets of\nmetaphysically possible worlds, since we need to distinguish between\nstates of information in which the available evidence rules out the\nsame metaphysically possible worlds but different metaphysically\nimpossible worlds. By the same token, the information encoded in a\nsentence cannot in general be identified with a set of metaphysically\npossible worlds, since two sentences may be true in all the same\nmetaphysically possible worlds, but not in all the same epistemically\npossible worlds. If we wanted to identify information and sentential\ncontents with sets of worlds, it would seem more promising to use sets\nof epistemically possible worlds. But the dualist may instead reject\nthe possible-worlds account of information and propositions altogether\n(see, e.g., Soames 1987, 2003, 395f.).\n",
