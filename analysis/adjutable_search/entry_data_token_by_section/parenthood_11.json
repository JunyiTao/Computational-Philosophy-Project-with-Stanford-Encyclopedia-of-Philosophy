    "main_text": "The Morality of Procreation || State Policies\n3.5 State Policies\n\nMany bioethicists move beyond a focus on individual rights to consider\nbroader effects of reproductive policy. As discussed in 2.2, these\ninclude communitarian conservatives who are concerned with the effects\nof reproductive policy, particularly regarding ARTs, on social\nattitudes towards the value of life and the meaning of family (Sandel\n2007). They also include liberals who share values of autonomy and\nequality with repro-libertarians, and as a result treat market\nexchanges and consensual services as \u201cinnocent until proven\nguilty.\u201d But rather than focusing just on the effects of\nparticular procreative choices, these liberals also attend to the\nimpact of institutionalizing practices such as genetic selection or\nIVF within a society that aims to maintain liberal background\ninstitutions (Glover et al. 1989; Buchanan et al. 2000; Brock 2005).\nInstitutionalization foregrounds concerns that liberals focused on\nindividual choices downplay, such as the effects of large numbers, the\nincentives that policies create, and opportunity costs. Thus for\npolicy liberals it will be impossible to determine the scope of\nprocreative rights without considering institutional structure and\nsocial context, given reasonable assumptions about human\nmotivations.\n\nFor instance, when many people make similar reproductive choices, the\nresulting \u201cbaby boom\u201d may reshape the social, economic,\npolitical, and environmental landscape. Such concerns apply to the use\nof ARTs, such as for sex selection: sex ratios might become grossly\nskewed in countries with a strong preference for male children (Xue\n2010). Such societal consequences are also predicted by disability\ntheorists who argue that normalizing genetic testing and embryo\nselection or abortion to prevent certain impairments could lead to\nincreased stigma against and decreased resources for people with such\nimpairments (see also the entry on\n disability).\n Such concerns might provide grounds for restricting ARTs or\nincentivizing their use.\n\nMuch recent debate has focused on the effects of the legal institution\nof the family on procreative choices and child welfare. Arguments for\nincentivizing procreation within marriage assume that children reared\nwithin marriages will benefit as contrasted with those reared outside\nmarriages (Galston 1991, chap. 10; but see Young 1995). Others have\nargued that legally separating marriage and parenting will allow the\nstate to support both children and their caregivers more directly\n(Shrage 2018) or that recognizing more than two parents will benefit\nchildren as well as serving broader social goals such as resource\nconservation (Gheaus 2019, Grill 2020). Such revisionist arguments\nextend to legal institutionalization of non-parental care for\nchildren: for example, Gheaus has argued for the institutional\nprovision of non-parental care on child welfare grounds (Gheaus 2011,\n2018b), and Brake for the legal recognition of paid childcare workers\nas family (Brake 2018). Liberal feminists have argued for state family\npolicy\u2014such as parental leave and incentives for egalitarian\nco-parenting\u2014to promote gender equality (e.g., Schouten 2019).\nAdoption policy has also been the focus of recent discussion, with\ndebates over open adoption and attention to the difficulties of LGBT\nadoption (Haslanger and Witt 2006; Baylis and McLeod 2014, Part IV).\nFamily policy also has effects on racial equality, as Dorothy Roberts\npoints out in her criticism of state policies on terminating parental\nrights which disporpotionately affect black families (Roberts\n2006).\n\nLiberal accounts of procreative autonomy may face problems in a\ncontext of social inequality and over-population. Some affirm\nprocreative autonomy, but regard it as compatible with apparently\ncoercive population policies such as limitations on the number of\nchildren particular persons may have. This may be because they regard\nprocreative autonomy as a merely prima facie right, less weighty than\nother rights, such as the right to a minimally decent quality of life\n(Bayles 1979). Or they may conceive of procreative autonomy more\nnarrowly than is commonly done (O\u2019Neill 1979; Hill 1991).\nO\u2019Neill, for example, construes procreative autonomy as\nrequiring an intention to rear the resulting child so that it has a\nlife at least normal for its society. Without such intentions, parents\nare not exercising a right to procreate, and thus policies to curtail\ntheir behavior do not constitute coercive infringements of procreative\nautonomy. Recent work in this area has examined the extent to which\nthe state is justified in restricting procreation in light of its\nenvironmental costs (e.g., Conly 2016). In sum, on such views,\nprocreative autonomy is one among many important forms of autonomy,\nwhich may conflict among themselves, and with the state\u2019s\nlegitimate (or compulsory) ends such as the provision of public goods\nand compliance with national constitutions. Talk of rights, from such\na standpoint, is appropriate only within a nexus of liberties, claims,\npowers, and ends. From such a perspective, the implications of a right\nto procreative autonomy are much less straightforward than from the\nindividually focused repro-libertarian perspective.\n\nOne further problem for liberals is posed by divergent societal views\non the nature of the good for children. Respecting such divergent\nviews seems to be required by equal respect, but this is in tension\nwith the need to define standards for child welfare and parental\nauthority. For example, balancing child welfare and parent autonomy\nmay be difficult in culturally diverse societies, in which state\nstandards of child welfare may be criticized as discriminatory against\nchild-rearing practices of cultural minorities (e.g., Dwyer 2018; for\ndiscussion of child welfare and state neutrality, see Fowler 2010 and\n2014).\n",
