    "main_text": "The Nature of Intuitions\n1. The Nature of Intuitions\n\nConsider the claim that a fully rational person does not believe both\np and not-p. Very likely, as you considered it, that\nclaim seemed true to you. Something similar probably happens when you\nconsider the following propositions:\n\n[I1]  If\nnot-not-p, then p.\n[I2]  Torturing a\nsentient being for fun is wrong.\n[I3]  It is impossible\nfor a square to have five sides.\n[I4]  A person would\nsurvive having their brain transplanted into a new body.\n\n\nThe focus of this entry is intuitions\u2014mental states or events in\nwhich a proposition seems true in the manner of these\npropositions.\n\nIt appears clear that ordinary usage includes more in the extension of\nthe term \u201cintuition\u201d than such states, as it would allow\nthat a parent might have an intuition that their child is innocent of\nsome crime or an archaeologist might have an intuition that an ancient\nsite of some interest was in a certain area. Some psychological\nresearch seems similarly permissive. Consider recent research on\n\u201cintuitions\u201d in naturalistic decision making (Klein 1998).\nSuch research has shown that agents with sufficient experience in a\ngiven domain (e.g., neonatal nursing, fire-fighting, or chess) arrive\nat judgments and make decisions on the basis of a cognitive process\nother than conscious considerations of various options and the\nweighing of evidence and utilities. Such expert\n\u201cintuitions\u201d that some infant suffers from sepsis, that a\nfire will take a certain course, or that a certain chess move is a\ngood one, appear immediately in consciousness.\n\nLess important than linguistic usage in various domains is whether our\ntheorizing captures the relevant psychological and epistemological\njoints to be found in the world. The focus of the present entry is the\nrole of intuitions in distinctively philosophical (and other\n\u201carmchair\u201d) inquiry. It is plausible (and will be assumed\nhere, but see Nado 2014 for doubts) that the intuitions of interest in\nphilosophy constitute a single epistemic and psychological kind\nexemplified by [I1]\u2013[I4] and by many additional examples which\nappear in\n \u00a72.2\n and\n \u00a72.3\n below, but not the sort noted in the previous paragraph.\n",
