    "main_text": "Perception\n4. Perception\n\nAs with the English word \u2018perception\u2019, the Sanskrit\n\u2018pratyak\u1e63a\u2019 so translated is used for both\nthe process of sensory connection with an object perceived and as the\nresultant awareness. In common Sanskrit, the word\n\u2018pratyak\u1e63a\u2019, etymologically \u201cbefore\nthe eyes,\u201d means something like \u201cexperientially\nevident\u201d when used as an adjective and \u201cimmediate\nexperience\u201d or \u201csense experience\u201d as a noun.\nInternal perceptions as of thought and emotion, pleasure and pain, and\nindeed of a \u201cself,\u201d \u0101tman, are considered in\nNy\u0101ya to be mediated by a \u201cmind\u201d or, in a better\ntranslation, an \u201cinternal organ,\u201d manas. A\nperception that targets a preceding perception or another cognition or\nmental event is given a special word,\n\u2018anuvyayas\u0101ya\u2019, \u201capperception,\u201d\nliterally an \u201cafter-cognition,\u201d a type of perception that\nis especially important in cross-school controversy. The internal\norgan, manas, also serves the function of channeling\ninformation from sense organs and bringing it together in perceptual\nknowledge for a self. Such a mental organ is denied by Buddhist\nadversaries and others in other schools, and is hotly debated within\nNy\u0101ya.\n",
