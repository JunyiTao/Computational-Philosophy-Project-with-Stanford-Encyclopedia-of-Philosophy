    "main_text": "Minority Cultural Rights Claims\n2. Minority Cultural Rights Claims\n\nThe four views of culture described above inform the cultural claims\nthat both individuals and groups make against the state. The specific\nthreats that individuals and groups face, and which demand a kind of\nprotection, are distinct, as are the responses that states may have in\nresponse to the claims made by individuals and groups (Eisenberg 2009:\n20\u201321). In some cases, claims are made for accommodations for\nall members of a group qua group; in others, claims are made with\nrespect to particular individuals; and there may well be connection\namong these. For example, a group may demand language protection\npolicies, or an individual may claim a right to speak her mother\ntongue in legal proceedings. These rights are related to each other,\nand may be in some cases derived from one another: one\u00a0reason an\nindividual has a right to speak her mother tongue in legal proceedings\nmay be because the state has recognized her language as an official\nlanguage either of the state, or of a sub-state jurisdiction, for\nexample. As a matter of accommodation, it will be important\nin what follows to notice when claims are made for accommodations that\napply to individuals and when they are accommodations that apply to\ngroups; although some philosophers are keen to assess whether cultural\nrights are best understood as individual or group rights (Casals\n2006), the analysis below proceeds by assuming that they can be both\n(following Levy 2000: 125).\n\nNotice as well that the term \u201caccommodation\u201d is a kind of\ncatch-all to include the wide range of claims an individual or group\ncan make against a state on the basis of culture. Political\nphilosophers have attempted to distinguish among these claims in\nmyriad ways, in order to make sense of them. Many such rights are\nclaimed by immigrant groups (typically) to a state, who require\ncertain accommodations from the state in order to better integrate\ninto that state. In the larger debate around the value of\nmulticulturalism, there is considerable discussion about which sorts\nof accommodations encourage the integration of, especially, culturally\ndistinct newcomers, and which sorts permit or even encourage their\nseparation from the larger society (e.g., Sniderman & Hagendoorn\n2007). Some scholars worry, as well, that a focus on how best to\naccommodate cultural minority groups travels with ignoring (perhaps\nwilfully) more important questions of redistribution to those who are\nless well off (Barry 2001; Fraser 1995). In general, however,\nmulticultural theorists agree that accommodation rights are most\ndefensible when they support the integration of minorities in general,\nand newcomers in particular, as well as when they are aimed at\nremedying persistent\u00a0inequalities between majority and minority\ngroups.\n\nIt is worth noting that not everyone readily agrees that\n\u201cculture\u201d should be treated as a source of distinct legal\nand political claims, however. For example, Sarah Song points\nout\u00a0that so-called \u201cmulticultural\u201d claims are often\nin fact claims to accommodate a wide range of groups, including\nracial, religious and ethnic groups. Many political theorists of\ncultural rights appear to believe that\u00a0there are distinct and\nrecognizable cultural groups, making distinctive cultural claims,\nwhereas in their example-giving they rely on a \u201cwide range of\nexamples involving religion, language, ethnicity, nationality, and\nrace\u201d (Song 2009: 177). Rarely is \u201cculture\u201d alone\nthe basis for a claim against a state. Rather, says Song, so-called\ncultural claims are in fact often demands\u00a0for other\nwell-understood and defensible democratic goods. Most such\ndemands\u00a0are for religious accommodations, well-defended by\nstandard liberal defenses of freedom of conscience; others are demands\nfor reparations for past and ongoing wrong, in the form of affirmative\naction; others yet are demands\u00a0for democratic inclusion, often\nrooted in a morally problematic history of deliberate exclusion. Once\nthe reasons for these \u201ccultural\u201d demands are revealed\nclearly, we will often find democratically defensible reasons to\nrespect and accommodate them, without needing to resort to relying on\nculture as a distinct entity, giving rise to a distinct set of\nrights-claims.\u00a0The result is that the controversy associated with\nproperly defining cultures and identifying their members can be\navoided in many instances. However, this analysis can make it\ndifficult to treat cases where something called \u201cculture\u201d\ninteracts with, or supplements, religious, ethnic, and racial\nclaims.\n\nTake the case of the choice, made by referendum, to ban minarets on\nmosques in Switzerland. The defensibility of the ban has been the\nsubject of deliberation among political philosophers, and one key\npoint of contention has been whether and to what extent minarets are\nreligiously required by Islam. Many interpreters propose\nthat, since minarets are not obligatory according to Islamic religious\nrequirements, the choice to ban them is regrettable (because of what\nit says about the public place of Islam in Switzerland), but it does\nnot violate the religious freedom of practising Muslims in\nSwitzerland, and as a result is permissible (Miller 2016). In making\nthis claim, however, what is ignored is the cultural\nsignificance of minarets. Without a recognition of the distinct place\nof culture in certain claims, a full understanding of the minaret case\ncannot be reached. The same challenge can be seen in deliberations\naround whether Muslim women should be permitted to wear face coverings\nin public spaces. Some commentators suggest that, because (according\nto some interpretations) Islamic texts do not appear to\nrequire face coverings, women can be denied the right to\nengage in this practice, without violating their religious freedom. In\nmaking this argument, its defenders notice that the choice to cover\nfaces is in effect a (mere) cultural interpretation of\nIslamic requirements, as evidenced by the fact that only some\ncommunities of practising Muslims engage in the practice. For some\nscholars, it is essential to separate religious from cultural\nclaims\u2014liberal democratic states take religious claims\nvery seriously as matters of conscience, and have a long\nhistory of zealously protecting religious freedom. So, having\ndetermined that a claim is not one of religious freedom, such\nscholars believe they can\u00a0comfortably deny the request for\npermission to cover faces in public spaces. However, ignoring the\ncultural dimensions of the claim\u2014or treating them as though they\nare obviously of less significance than the underlying religious\nclaim\u2014fails to treat the case properly. In particular,\nit\u00a0fails to take seriously that religious obligations necessarily\nhave cultural interpretations, that a full recognition of religious\nfreedom entails recognizing their cultural interpretations,\nand that specifically cultural legal and political accommodation (of a\nreligious commitment)\u00a0will thereby be called for.\n\nIn what follows, distinct types of cultural claims, made against a\nstate\u2019s major institutions, will be examined. These claims are,\nas will be seen, sometimes made by individuals and sometimes by\ngroups. Where relevant, the analysis will highlight whether the\nconcept of culture that is being deployed is culture-as-encompassing\ngroup, culture-as-social-formation, culture-as-narrative, or\nculture-as-identity. The analysis will not always be neat. In some\ncases, there will be multiple defenses of a cultural right, which rely\non distinct understandings of culture.\n",
