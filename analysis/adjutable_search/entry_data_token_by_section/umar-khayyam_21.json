    "main_text": "Khayyam in the West || Orientalism and the European Khayyam\n5.1 Orientalism and the European Khayyam\nThe earliest extant translation of the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t was produced by Thomas Hyde in the 1760s when his translation of a single quatrain appeared in the Veterum Persarum et Parthorum et Medorum Religionis. It was not until the 19th century, however, that the Western world and literary circles discovered Umar Khayyam in all his richness.\nThe voyage of the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t to the West began when Sir Gore Ouseley, the British ambassador to Iran, presented his collection to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University upon his return to England. In the 1840s Professor Edward Byles Cowell of Oxford University discovered a copy of the Ruba\u2018iyyat of Khayyam and translated several of the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t. Amazed by their profundity, he shared them with Edward FitzGerald, who took an immediate interest and published the first edition of his own translation in 1859. Four versions of FitzGerald\u2019s Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t were published over his lifetime as new quatrains were discovered. Realizing the free nature of his work in his first translation, FitzGerald chose the word rendered to appear on the title page in later editions instead of \u201ctranslation\u201d (Lange 1968).\n",
