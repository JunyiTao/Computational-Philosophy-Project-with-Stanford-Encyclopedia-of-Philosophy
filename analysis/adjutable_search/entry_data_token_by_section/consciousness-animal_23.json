It is also behind the idea that knowing\nthat horses have near 360\u00b0 vision, or that raptors have two fovea\non each retina, may tell us something about the nature of their\nexperiences \u2014 how the world appears to them \u2014 if it is\ngranted that they have such experiences. Neural investigation adds a\nfurther layer of analysis to scientific understanding of the nature of\nperception. For instance, Leopold & Logothetis (1996) used neural\ndata to support inferences about the percepts of monkeys under\nconditions of binocular rivalry (see also: Myserson et\nal. 1981; Rees et al. 2002). And Leopold et\nal. (2003) argue that neural recordings can be used to\ncorroborate the non-verbal \u201creports\u201d of monkeys shown\nambiguous visual stimuli.  (Think here of whether it is possible for\nthe monkey to report that it is subject to Gestalt switches like those\narising from ambiguous figures such as the duck-rabbit or figure-vase\nillusions.)\n The phenomenon of blindsight, a form of unconscious visual\nperception that arises with damage to specific areas of primary visual\ncortex, has also been investigated in surgically lesioned monkeys\n(Stoerig & Cowey 1997), with a close correspondence between the\nmonkeys\u2019 deficits and those of the human patients vis-\u00e0-vis\nparts of the visual field that can be processed only unconsciously,\nand those for which the patients retain consciousness. The non-verbal\napproach to assessing visual awareness has been further validated by\nStoerig et al. (2002).  Blindsight subjects, both human and monkey, do\nnot spontaneously respond to things presented to their scotomas (areas\nwhere they are visually unaware), but must be trained to make\nresponses using a forced-response paradigm (Stoerig & Cowey\n1997). \n\n\nThe emphasis on visual perception in most of these examples, no doubt\nreflects a primatocentric bias.  We human primates are highly visual\ncreatures, and, as Nagel (1974) argued, we face considerable hurdles\nin imagining (again, a visual metaphor) the subjective experiences of\ncreatures in modalities in which humans are weak or completely\nunendowed. The examples of research also reflect an anthropocentric\nbias in that much of the animal experimentation is explicitly targeted\nat relieving human disorders. Although there is good work by\nneuroethologists on the psychophysics of echolocation by bats and\ndolphins, or on the sensory capacities of weakly electric fish,\nquestions of subjective awareness are generally not broached in that\nliterature.\n\n\nAs with the investigation of animal pain, fine-grained analysis of the\nneural correlates of consciousness may reveal subtle differences\nbetween different species.  For instance, Rees et al. (2002)\nreport that while the behavior of rhesus monkeys is rather similar to\nhumans under conditions of binocular rivalry, \u201cthe firing of\nmost cells in and around V1 primarily reflects stimulus properties\nrather than the conscious percept reported by the animal ... However,\nseveral neuroimaging studies in humans have presented evidence that\nargues for a stronger role of V1 in binocular rivalry and hence, by\nimplication, visual awareness.\u201d Nevertheless, it is noteworthy\nthat they take the behavioral evidence to be unproblematically\ndescribable as report of a conscious percept by the monkey.\n",
