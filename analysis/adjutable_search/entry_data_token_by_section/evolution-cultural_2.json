    "main_text": "What Evolves? || Transmission and Inheritance\n2.2 Transmission and Inheritance\n\nThere are two major approaches to marking out the distinctive nature\nof cultural transmission and inheritance. The first looks at important\naspects of the content of information; the second, the\nrelevant channel of transmission mechanisms.\n\nAs an example of the first approach, consider Jablonka and Lamb\n(2005). They claim that only some forms of social transmission make\nuse of a system of symbols. While it is true, for instance,\nthat some birds inherit their song by social transmission, this does\nnot imply that birdsong is a symbolic system. Humans, by contrast,\ntrade in publicly-accessible symbols.\n\nThis approach allows for further distinctions among types of symbol\nsystem that make them more or less amenable to change. In some cases,\nthe relationship between a symbol and what is represented is\narbitrary. This the case for a word like \u201cairplane\u201d, which\ndoes not look or sound like a plane. This arbitrariness can facilitate\nrapid change in the scripts or sounds used to denote a plane (Kelly et\nal. 2021). In cases of iconic symbolism, the relationship is\none of resemblance: signs for the airport do look like a plane. These\nmay be less likely to change (Miton & Morin 2021).\n\nJablonka and Lamb use the characteristic differences between typical\nmodes of social inheritance in animals and humans to illuminate the\nimpact symbolic transmission systems have on human cultural evolution\n(see also: Deacon 1997). Although they argue that there can be\nnon-linguistic symbolic systems (Jablonka & Lamb 2005: 224),\nlanguage exemplifies nicely the way in which systems of symbols\ncontain elements that can be recombined in countless ways to yield a\nvast array of different meaningful messages. Furthermore, repositories\nof symbolically stored information, such as books, computer databases,\nand libraries can also be searched, annotated, edited and so forth, in\nways that add to their power and versatility. Such repositories can be\npowerful means by which knowledge accumulates across generations.\n\nThis manner of thinking opens several challenging issues. One\nimportant issue is the degree to which symbolic systems resemble other\ninheritance systems. Consider, by way of example, Stegmann\u2019s\n(2004) discussion of the sense in which the genetic code is\n\u201carbitrary\u201d. One quickly realizes that attempts to specify\nwhat makes some inheritance system a symbolic system, and to\ndifferentiate between types of symbolic systems (linguistic,\nnon-linguistic and so forth) is philosophically demanding.\n\nA contrasting approach aims at distinguishing cultural inheritance and\ntransmission by focusing on a distinctive channel by which\ninformation moves. Typically, this identifies cultural inheritance\nwith information carried by mechanisms of social learning, as opposed\nto genetically transmitted information, or information transmitted via\nother \u201cchannels\u201d (Boyd & Richerson 1985; Richerson\n& Boyd 2005). Yet what is social learning?\n\nIn an important overview of work on cultural evolution, Henrich\ndefines this key notion alongside the notion of \u201cindividual\nlearning\u201d that it is regularly contrasted with:\n\n\n\u2026 social learning refers to any time an individual\u2019s\nlearning is influenced by others, and it includes many different kinds\nof psychological processes. Individual learning refers to situations\nin which individuals learn by observing or interacting directly with\ntheir environment (Henrich 2016: 12)\n\n\nOne consequence of this definition (a consequence which Henrich\nexplicitly recognizes) is that \u201csocial learning\u201d and\n\u201cindividual learning\u201d are not exclusive. In our species it\nis rarely the case that what an individual learns is free from\ninfluence by others. Even in extreme cases, where we learn by probing\nour surroundings well away from social company, almost every aspect of\nthe environments we interact with\u2014and hence what we end up\nlearning from those environments\u2014has been affected by other\npeople\u2019s past actions. The structures and contents of our\ndwellings and workplaces, the constitutions of the domesticated plants\nand animals we interact with, the cultivated and engineered\nenvironments we live in, all have been affected by the activities of\nour predecessors.\n\nYet as the distinction between social and individual learning blurs,\nthe question of whether there is a distinctive culture channel becomes\nless clear (Lewens 2017). For there are numerous ways in which\nactivities of one generation can, by altering or maintaining stable\nfeatures of biotic, social, and technical environments, have an\ninfluence over what individuals in the following generations end up\nlearning (Laland, Odling-Smee, & Feldman 2000).\n\nIn response to these concerns, researchers have been motivated to find\nfurther distinguishing characteristics of sub-varieties of social\nlearning. Henrich, for instance holds that\n\n\n\u2026the least sophisticated forms of social learning occur simply\nas a by-product of being around others, and engaging in individual\nlearning.\n\n\nHe reserves the term \u201ccultural learning\u201d for the\n\n\nmore sophisticated subclass of social learning abilities in which\nindividuals seek to acquire information from others. (2016:\n12\u201313)\n\n\nCritics of these final comments (e.g., Clarke & Heyes 2017; Heyes\n2018) have urged further research concerning whether individual\nlearning\u2014which, as we have seen, can take place in felicitously\nstructured environments\u2014truly is less sophisticated than forms\nof learning directed to the behaviors of others. They encourage us to\nquestion whether there is an additional form of complexity in the\ncognitive mechanisms that underpin social (compared with individual)\nlearning, and whether social learning has greater functionality with\nrespect to the generation of increasingly refined behaviors,\ntechnologies, norms and institutions across populations.\n",
