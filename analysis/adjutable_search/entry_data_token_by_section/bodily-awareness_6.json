    "main_text": "The perceptual model of bodily awareness || The spatiality of bodily awareness\n2.2 The spatiality of bodily awareness\n\nOne can also question the perceptual character of bodily sensations on\nthe basis of their peculiar spatiality. We experience sensations\n\u201cat-a-part-of-body-at-a-point-in-body-relative-space\u201d\n(O\u2019Shaughnessy 1980). In Berm\u00fadez\u2019s (2005) terms,\nbodily sensations have both A-location (i.e., bodily frame of\nreference independent of the posture of the body) and B-location\n(i.e., external frame relative to the posture of the body). But how to\naccount for A and B-location? As Merleau-Ponty (1945: 98) warns,\n\u201cordinary spatial relations do not cross\u201d the experience\nof the space of the body. It seems indeed that the way we experience\nbodily space does not follow some basic spatial rules (Coburn 1966;\nVesey 1964; Margolis 1966; K. Baier, 1964; Holly 1986). For instance,\nthe pain that I feel in my thumb is not felt in my mouth when my thumb\nis in my mouth (Block 1983). Nor does it seem to make sense to claim\nthat the pain in my thumb is far from the pain in my foot. How can one\nenvisage accounting for bodily space in terms of Cartesian reference\nframe when one cannot provide a center of this frame, nor suggest axes\non which one could compute distances and directions (Berm\u00fadez\n2005)? One may conclude that the claim that one feels pain in\nthe finger does not indicate the location of the sensation, but rather\nthe state of the finger (Noordhof 2001; for discussion see Tye 2002).\nOne may then question whether bodily\nsensations themselves are intrinsically spatial. According to the\nLocal sign theory, as defended in the 19th century by psychologists\nsuch as Wundt, Titchener and James, each sensible nerve gives rise to\nits own characteristic sensation that is specific to the body part\nthat is stimulated but spatial ascription does not derive from the\nspatial content of bodily sensations themselves. As described by James\n(1890: 798), the Local sign theorists deny \n\n\nthat there can be in a sensation any element of actual locality, any\ntone as it were which cries to us immediately and without further ado,\n\u201cI am here\u201d, or \u201cI am there\u201d. \n\n\nHowever, there seems to be no non-spatial differences between\nsensations in one\u2019s right and left hands (Holly 1986;\nO\u2019Shaughnessy 1980; Margolis 1966; Coburn 1966). How then do I\nfeel the right or the left hand to be touched? And how to account for\nsensations felt to be located in phantom limbs (K. Baier 1964)? It is\nhard to explain spatial ascription of bodily sensations if bodily\nsensations are not intrinsically spatial.\n\nAccording to A. D. Smith (2002), perception requires the possibility\nof achieving different perspectives on perceptible objects through\nself-movement. This comes with the existence of perceptual constancies\n(see Burge 2010 for the importance of perceptual constancies).\nHowever, unlike other perceptual objects, the body cannot be felt from\ndifferent perspectives. Smith thus claims that bodily sensations are\nmere sensations; they do not count as perceptual. Likewise, Matthen\n(forthcoming) distinguishes within the sense of touch the tactual\nsensation on one\u2019s skin and the haptic perception of the object.\nThese are two distinct types of experiences and only haptic\nexperiences are truly spatial, and thus truly perceptual. On the\ncontrary, Martin (1992) claims that there is no reason to draw a\ndistinction within tactile experiences: one can simply shift\none\u2019s attention from the bodily side to the exteroceptive side\nof the same perceptual experience (see also O\u2019Shaughnessy 1989).\nNonetheless, according to Martin (1992), touch differs from vision\ninsofar as it has no unified tactile field equivalent to the visual\nfield (see also Richardson 2013; Hopkins 2011).\n",
