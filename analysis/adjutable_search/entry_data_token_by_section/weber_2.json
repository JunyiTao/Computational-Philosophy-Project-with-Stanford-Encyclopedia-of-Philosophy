    "main_text": "Philosophical Influences || Knowledge: Neo-Kantianism\n2.1 Knowledge: Neo-Kantianism\n\nWeber encountered the pan-European cultural crisis of his time mainly\nas filtered through the jargon of German Historicism [Beiser 2011].\nHis early training in law had exposed him to the sharp divide between\nthe reigning Labandian legal positivism and the historical\njurisprudence championed by Otto von Gierke (one of his teachers at\nBerlin); in his later incarnation as a political economist, he was\nkeenly interested in the heated \u201cstrife over methods\u201d\n(Methodenstreit) between the positivist economic methodology\nof Carl Menger and the historical economics of Schmoller (his mentor\nduring the early days). Arguably, however, it was not until Weber grew\nacquainted with the Baden or Southwestern School of Neo-Kantians,\nespecially through Wilhelm Windelband, Emil Lask, and Heinrich Rickert\n(his one-time colleague at Freiburg), that he found a rich conceptual\ntemplate suitable for the clearer elaboration of his own\nepistemological position.\n\nIn opposition to a Hegelian emanationist epistemology, briefly,\nNeo-Kantians shared the Kantian dichotomy between reality and concept.\nNot an emanent derivative of concepts as Hegel posited, reality is\nirrational and incomprehensible, and the concept, only an abstract\nconstruction of our mind. Nor is the concept a matter of will,\nintuition, and subjective consciousness as Wilhelm Dilthey posited.\nAccording to Hermann Cohen, one of the early Neo-Kantians, concept\nformation is fundamentally a cognitive process, which cannot but be\nrational as Kant held. If our cognition is logical and all reality\nexists within cognition, then only a reality that we can comprehend in\nthe form of knowledge is rational \u2013 metaphysics is thereby\nreduced to epistemology, and Being to logic. As such, the process of\nconcept formation both in the natural (Natur-) and the\ncultural-historical sciences (Geisteswissenschaften) has to\nbe universal as well as abstract, not different in kind but in their\nsubject matters. The latter is only different in dealing with the\nquestion of values in addition to logical relationships.\n\nFor Windelband, however, the difference between the two kinds of\nknowledge has to do with its aim and method as well.\nCultural-historical knowledge is not concerned with a phenomenon\nbecause of what it shares with other phenomena, but rather because of\nits own definitive qualities. For values, which form its proper\nsubject, are radically subjective, concrete and individualistic.\nUnlike the \u201cnomothetic\u201d knowledge that natural science\nseeks, what matters in historical science is not a universal law-like\ncausality, but an understanding of the particular way in which an\nindividual ascribes values to certain events and institutions or takes\na position towards the general cultural values of his/her time under a\nunique, never-to-be-repeated constellation of historical\ncircumstances. Therefore, cultural-historical science seeks\n\u201cideographic\u201d knowledge; it aims to understand the\nparticular, concrete and irrational \u201chistorical\nindividual\u201d with inescapably universal, abstract, and\nrational concepts. Turning irrational reality into rational concept,\nit does not simply paint (abbilden) a picture of reality but\ntransforms (umbilden) it. Occupying the gray area between\nirrational reality and rational concept, then, its question became\ntwofold for the Neo-Kantians. One is in what way we can understand the\nirreducibly subjective values held by the historical actors in an\nobjective fashion, and the other, by what criteria we can select a\ncertain historical phenomenon as opposed to another as historically\nsignificant subject matter worthy of our attention. In short, the\nissue was not only the values to be comprehended by the seeker of\nhistorical knowledge, but also his/her own values, which are no less\nsubjective. Value-judgment (Werturteil) as well as value\n(Wert) became a keen issue.\n\nAccording to Rickert\u2019s definitive elaboration, value-judgment\nprecedes values. He posits that the \u201cin-dividual,\u201d as\nopposed to mere \u201cindividual,\u201d phenomenon can be isolated\nas a discrete subject of our historical inquiry when we ascribe\ncertain subjective values to the singular coherence and indivisibility\nthat are responsible for its uniqueness. In his theory of\nvalue-relation (Wertbeziehung), Rickert argues that relating\nhistorical objects to values can still retain objective validity when\nit is based on a series of explicitly formulated conceptual\ndistinctions. They are to be made firmly between the\ninvestigator\u2019s values and those of the historical actor under\ninvestigation, between personal or private values and general cultural\nvalues of the time, and between subjective value-judgment and\nobjective value-relations. In so positing, however, Rickert is making\ntwo highly questionable assumptions. One is that there are certain\nvalues in every culture that are universally accepted within that\nculture as valid, and the other, that a historian free of bias must\nagree on what these values are. Just as natural science must assume\n\u201cunconditionally and universally valid laws of nature,\u201d\nso, too, cultural-historical science must assume that there are\n\u201cunconditionally and universally valid values.\u201d If so, an\n\u201cin-dividual\u201d historical event has to be reduced to an\n\u201cindividual\u201d manifestation of the objective process of\nhistory, a conclusion that essentially implies that Rickert returned\nto the German Idealist faith in the meaningfulness of history and the\nobjective validity of the diverse values to be found in history. An\nempirical study in historical science, in the end, cannot do without a\nmetaphysics of history. Bridging irrational reality and rational\nconcept in historical science, or overcoming hiatus\nirrationalis (\u00e0 la Emil Lask) without recourse to a\nmetaphysics of history still remained a problem as acutely as before.\nWhile accepting the broadly neo-Kantian conceptual template as Rickert\nelaborated it, Weber\u2019s methodological writings would turn mostly\non this issue.\n",
