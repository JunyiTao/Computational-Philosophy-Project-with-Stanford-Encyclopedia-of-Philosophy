    "main_text": "Other Issues Concerning Simplicity || Principles of Plenitude\n6.3 Simplicity and Induction\n\nThe problem of induction is closely linked to the issue of simplicity.\nOne obvious link is between the curve-fitting problem and the\ninductive problem of predicting future outcomes from observed data.\nLess obviously, Schulte (1999) argues for a connection between\ninduction and ontological parsimony. Schulte frames the problem of\ninduction in information-theoretic terms: given a data-stream of\nobservations of non-unicorns (for example), what general conclusion\nshould be drawn? He argues for two constraints on potential rules.\nFirst, the rule should converge on the truth in the long run (so if no\nunicorns exist then it should yield this conclusion). Second, the rule\nshould minimize the maximum number of changes of hypothesis, given\ndifferent possible future observations. Schulte argues that the\n\u2018Occam Rule\u2019\u2014conjecture that \\(\\Omega\\) does not exist\nuntil it has been detected in an experiment\u2014is optimal relative\nto these constraints. An alternative rule\u2014for example,\nconjecturing that \\(\\Omega\\) exists until 1 million negative results have\nbeen obtained\u2014may result in two changes of hypothesis if, say,\n\\(\\Omega\\)\u2019s are not detected until the 2 millionth experiment. The Occam\nRule leads to at most one change of hypothesis (when an \\(\\Omega\\) is\nfirst detected). (See also Kelly 2004, 2007.) Schulte (2008) applies\nthis approach to the problem of discovering conservation laws in\nparticle physics. The analysis has been criticized by Fitzpatrick\n(2013), who raises doubts about why long-run convergence to the truth\nshould matter when it comes to predicting the outcome of the very next\nexperiment, and the debate is continued in Kelly et al. (2016).\n\nWith respect to the justification question, arguments have been made\nin both directions. Scientists are often inclined to justify\nsimplicity principles on broadly inductive grounds. According to this\nargument, scientists select new hypotheses based partly on criteria\nthat have been generated inductively from previous cases of theory\nchoice. Choosing the most parsimonious of the acceptable alternative\nhypotheses has tended to work in the past. Hence scientists continue\nto use this as a rule of thumb, and are justified in so doing on\ninductive grounds. One might try to bolster this point of view by\nconsidering a counterfactual world in which all the fundamental\nconstituents of the universe exist in pairs. In such a\n\u2018pairwise\u2019 world, scientists might well prefer pairwise\nhypotheses in general to their more parsimonious rivals. This line of\nargument has a couple of significant weaknesses. Firstly, one might\nlegitimately wonder just how successful the choice of parsimonious\nhypotheses has been; examples from chemistry spring to mind, such as\noxygen molecules containing two atoms rather than one. Secondly, and\nmore importantly, there remains the issue of explaining why\nthe preference for parsimonious hypotheses in science has been as\nsuccessful as it has been.\n\nMaking the justificatory argument in the reverse direction, from\nsimplicity to induction, has a strong historical precedent in\nphilosophical approaches to the problem of induction, from Hume\nonwards. Justifying the \u2018straight rule\u2019 of induction by\nappeal to some general Principle of Uniformity is an initially\nappealing response to the skeptical challenge. However, in the absence\nof a defense of the underlying Principle itself (and one which does\nnot, on pain of circularity, depend inductively on past success), it\nis unclear how much progress this represents. There have also been\nattempts (see e.g. Steel 2009) to use simplicity considerations to\nrespond to Nelson Goodman\u2019s \u2018new riddle of induction.\u2019\n",
