    "main_text": "Introduction || The Argument Against the Traditional Square\n1.2 The Argument Against the Traditional Square\n\n\nWhy does the traditional square need revising at all? The argument\nis a simple\n one:[2]\nSuppose that \u2018S\u2019 is an empty term; it\nis true of nothing. Then the I form: \u2018Some\nS is P\u2019 is false. But then its contradictory\nE form: \u2018No S is P\u2019\nmust be true. But then the subaltern O form:\n\u2018Some S is not P\u2019 must be true. But that\nis wrong, since there aren\u2019t any Ss.\n\n\nThe puzzle about this argument is why the doctrine of the\ntraditional square was maintained for well over 20 centuries in the\nface of this consideration. Were 20 centuries of logicians so obtuse as\nnot to have noticed this apparently fatal flaw? Or is there some other\nexplanation?\n\n\nOne possibility is that logicians previous to the 20th century must\nhave thought that no terms are empty. You see this view referred to\nfrequently as one that others\n held.[3]\n But with a few very\nspecial exceptions (discussed below) I have been unable to find anyone\nwho held such a view before the nineteenth century. Many authors do not\ndiscuss empty terms, but those who do typically take their presence for\ngranted. Explicitly rejecting empty terms was never a mainstream\noption, even in the nineteenth century.\n\n\nAnother possibility is that the particular I form\nmight be true when its subject is empty.  This was a common view\nconcerning indefinite propositions when they are read\ngenerically, such as \u2018A dodo is a bird\u2019, which (arguably)\ncan be true now without there being any dodos now, because being a\nbird is part of the essence of being a dodo.  But the truth of such\nindefinite propositions with empty subjects does not bear on the forms\nof propositions that occur in the square.  For although the indefinite\n\u2018A dodo ate my lunch\u2019 might be held to be equivalent to\nthe particular proposition \u2018Some dodo ate my lunch\u2019,\ngeneric indefinites like \u2018A dodo is a bird\u2019, are quite\ndifferent, and their semantics does not bear on the quantified\nsentences in the square of opposition. \n\nIn fact, the traditional doctrine of [SQUARE] is completely coherent\nin the presence of empty terms. This is because on the traditional\ninterpretation, the O form lacks existential\nimport. The O form is (vacuously) true if its subject\nterm is empty, not false, and thus the logical interrelations of\n[SQUARE] are unobjectionable. In what follows, I trace the development\nof this view.\n",
