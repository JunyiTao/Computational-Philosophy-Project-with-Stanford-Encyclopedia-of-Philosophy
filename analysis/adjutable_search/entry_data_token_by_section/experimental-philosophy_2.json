    "main_text": "Research in Experimental Philosophy || The Negative Program\n2.1 The Negative Program\n\nIn the Theaetetus, Socrates asks, \u201cHerein lies the\ndifficulty which I can never solve to my satisfaction\u2014What is\nknowledge?\u201d (146a). The subsequent philosophical discussion often\nproceeds by setting out various hypotheses, e.g., that knowledge is\ntrue belief, and considering possible counterexamples to the\nhypothesis. So, for instance, Socrates argues that knowledge\nisn\u2019t simply true belief because a skilled lawyer can persuade a\nperson to have a belief that is true, but that belief wouldn\u2019t\nactually be knowledge [see the entry on the\n Theaetetus].\n Socrates typically expects, and receives, agreement from his\ninterlocutor. Nor does Socrates ask his interlocutor, \u201cWhat is\nyour conception of knowledge\u201d or \u201cWhat counts as\nknowledge for Athenians?\u201d Rather, he seems to expect a global\nanswer about what knowledge is. In addition, he seems to expect that\nknowledge has a single nature, as suggested by his telling Theaetetus,\n\u201cI want you\u2026 to give one single account of the many\nbranches of knowledge\u201d (148d).\n\nWork in the negative program of experimental philosophy uses\nempirical work to challenge this traditional philosophical project.\nTwo somewhat different challenges have been developed.\n2.1.1 The argument from diversity\n\nOne challenge arises from the prospect of systematic diversity in how\ndifferent populations of people think about philosophical questions.\nThe possibility of such diversity had been raised before (e.g., Stich\n1990), but experimental philosophers have sought to provide evidence\nof such diversity. For instance, an early study reported differences\nbetween East Asian students and Western students on famous cases from\nepistemology (Weinberg et al. 2001). Another early study provided\nevidence for cultural differences in judgments about reference. East\nAsians were more likely than Westerners to have descriptivist\njudgments about the reference of proper names (Machery et al. 2004).\nSome studies have also found gender differences in intuitions about\nphilosophical cases (see, e.g., Buckwalter & Stich 2014; Friesdorf\net al. 2015). In addition, there are systematic individual differences\nin philosophical intuition; for example, people who are more\nextraverted are more inclined to compatibilism about responsibility\n(Feltz & Cokely 2009).\n\nThis apparent diversity in intuitions about philosophical matters has\nbeen used to challenge the use of intuitions in philosophy to tell us\nabout the nature of things like knowledge and reference. If intuitions\nabout knowledge turn out to exhibit diversity between populations,\nthen this looks to put pressure on a traditional philosophical\nproject. In rough form, the worry arises from the following\nclaims:\n\nD1. The philosophical\ntradition uses intuitions regarding philosophically important\ncategories or kinds like knowledge in an effort to determine\nthe nature of those categories\nD2.  Knowledge\n(like many other philosophical categories) has a single nature.\nIt\u2019s not the case that knowledge is one thing in Athens and\nanother thing in Sparta. \nD3.  Intuitions about\nphilosophical categories systematically vary between populations (by\nculture, for instance)\nD4.  The diversity in\nintuition cannot be dismissed by privileging the intuitions of one\npopulation.\n\n\nEach of these claims has been challenged. Some argue that philosophers\ndo not\u2014or should not\u2014rely on intuitions (thus rejecting\nD1) (see\n section 3.1);\n others hold, contra D4, that certain populations (e.g., professional\nphilosophers) are specially positioned to have reliable intuitions\n(see\n section 3.2).\n\nAnother way to defuse the challenge is to argue (contra D2) that we\nneedn\u2019t suppose that knowledge has a single nature, but\ninstead allow for a kind of pluralism. For instance,\n\u201cknowledge\u201d might pick out different epistemic notions in\ndifferent communities. A pluralist might allow, or even celebrate,\nthis diversity. Even if other communities have different epistemic\nvalues than we do, this need not undermine our valuing knowledge, as\nit is construed in our community (e.g., Sosa 2009: 109; also Lycan\n2006). For a pluralist, empirical demonstrations of diversity\nneedn\u2019t undermine traditional philosophical methods, but might\ninstead reveal important epistemic features that we have missed.\n\nA more conservative response to the challenge, which leaves\ntraditional philosophy largely untouched, is to question whether there\nreally is diversity between populations in intuitions about\nphilosophical categories. One way to develop this response is to claim\nthat participants in different populations might simply interpret the\nscenarios in different ways; in that case, we could explain their\ndifferent answers by saying that they are responding to different\nquestions (e.g., Sosa 2009). \n\nMore importantly, a growing body of empirical evidence has called into\nquestion the claim that there really are large differences in\nphilosophical intuitions across populations. Some of the original\nfindings of culture differences have not replicated (e.g., Nagel et\nal. 2013; Kim & Yuan 2015); similarly, many of the original\nfindings of gender differences haven\u2019t replicated (e.g.,\nSeyedsayamdost 2015; Adleberg et al. 2015). These findings provide\nstrong reason to believe that some of the effects suggested by early\nexperimental philosophy studies do not, in fact, exist at all.\nMoreover, experimental philosophers have also uncovered robust\ncross-cultural uniformity. For instance, one recent cross-cultural\nstudy examined intuitions about Gettier cases across four very\ndifferent cultures (Brazil, India, Japan, and the USA), with\nparticipants in all groups tending to deny knowledge to the\nprotagonist in Gettier cases (Machery et al. 2015). This suggests that\nthere might be a universal \u201ccore folk epistemology\u201d\n(Machery et al. 2015). In any case, these kinds of results suggest\nthat there is less diversity than had been suggested.\n2.1.2 The argument from sensitivity\n\nThe foregoing argument is based on diversity between populations. But\nexperimental philosophers in the negative program have also used\nintra-individual diversity to undermine traditional philosophical\nmethods (Swain et al. 2008; Sinnott-Armstrong 2008; Weinberg\n2016).\nExperimental philosophers have found that people\u2019s judgments\nabout philosophical cases are sensitive to various kinds of contextual\nfactors that seem to be philosophically irrelevant. The same person\nwill give different responses depending on apparently irrelevant\nfactors of presentation. People\u2019s judgments about cases are\naffected by the induction of irrelevant emotions (Cameron et al.\n2013), the order in which cases are presented (Petrinovich and\nO\u2019Neill 1996; Swain et al. 2008; Wright 2010), and the way an\noutcome is described (e.g., Petrinovich and O\u2019Neill 1996;\nSchwitzgebel & Cushman 2015).\n\nSensitivity to contextual factors has been used to challenge the\nphilosophical use of intuition in a way that is somewhat distinct from\nthe diversity argument. The challenge begins with the same assumption\nabout the role of intuitions in philosophy, but then draws on somewhat\ndifferent considerations:\n\nS1.  The philosophical\ntradition uses intuitions regarding philosophically important\ncategories or kinds like knowledge in an effort to determine\nthe nature of those categories\nS2.  A person\u2019s\njudgments about philosophical cases are sensitive to contextual\nfactors like the order of presentation.\nS3.  Sensitivity to\nthese factors is epistemically inappropriate\nS4.  This inappropriate\nsensitivity cannot be dismissed by privileging the intuitions of one\npopulation (e.g., philosophers)\nS5.  We can\u2019t\ntell, from the armchair, which of our judgments are inappropriately\nsensitive in this way.\n\n\nThis set of claims presents a challenge because it seems that even\nphilosophers are susceptible to these epistemically inapt influences,\nand we can\u2019t tell which of our intuitions are to be trusted.\nThus, philosophers are on shaky epistemic ground when they rely on\ntheir intuitions to try to glean philosophical truths.\n\nObviously, the argument from sensitivity is developed in different\nways depending on the category in question and the evidence of\nsensitivity, but it\u2019s useful to see how the general claims\n(S1\u2013S5) might be questioned. (See\n section 3.1\n for the rejection of intuition in philosophy (S1) and\n section 3.2\n for a defense of privileged populations [contra S4]).\n\nAlthough there are replicable effects on the influence of contextual\nfactors, pace S2 many of these effects seem too small to\nthreaten the practice of relying on intuitions (see, e.g.,\nDemaree-Cotton 2016; May 2014). The effect might amount to the\ndifference between 2.2 and 2.5 on a 7 point scale. It\u2019s hard to\nsee how such a difference threatens the practice of relying on the\noperative intuitions.\n\nIn some cases, contextual factors have more pronounced effects, and do\nlead to changes in participants\u2019 verdict about a case. For\ninstance, judgments about certain moral dilemmas and judgments about\ncertain epistemic cases are changed depending on previously seen cases\n(e.g., Petrinovich & O\u2019Neill 1996; Swain et al. 2008).\nHowever, it\u2019s possible that participants respond differently to\na case because the contextual differences actually provide an\nepistemically appropriate basis for changing one\u2019s judgment. For\ninstance, in the order effect studies, seeing one case can provide\nevidence about the appropriate response on another case\n(Horne & Livengood 2016). On this view, we can grant that\nparticipants change their judgment, but deny that they are doing so in\na way that is epistemically inappropriate.\n\nFinally, even if people\u2019s judgments do change in epistemically\ninappropriate ways, people might be able to recognize which judgments\nare especially trustworthy. For instance, only some thought\nexperiments are susceptible to order effects, and it turns out that\nfor these thought experiments, people have lower confidence in their\nresponses (e.g., Wright 2010; Zamzow & Nichols 2009). This\nsuggests (contra D5) that there might be an internal\nresource\u2014confidence\u2014that can be used to discern which\njudgments are epistemically unstable.\n2.2 Free Will and Moral Responsibility\n\nResearch in experimental philosophy has explored many aspects of lay\nbeliefs regarding free will. Experimental philosophers have designed\nimproved scales for measuring belief in free will (Nadelhoffer et al.\n2014; Deery et al. 2015), they have investigated the role of the\ndesire to punish in attributing free will (Clark et al. 2014), and\nthey have examined the impact of the belief in free will on moral\nbehavior (Baumeister et al. 2009). But the most intensively studied\nissue concerns intuitions about whether free will is compatible with\ndeterminism.\n\nExperimental philosophers have argued that the philosophical defense\nof incompatibilism depends on intuitions (e.g., Nahmias et al., 2006).\nThe question about whether incompatibilism is true depends on a wide\nvariety of factors, but experimental philosophers have argued that one\nfactor that plausibly matters is the alleged intuitiveness of the\nthought that determinism is incompatible with free will (Murray &\nNahmias 2014, but see Sommers 2010). This then generates a question\nthat invites an empirical inquiry: is incompatibilism\nintuitive? (Nahmias et al. 2006).\n\nOne of the first experimental studies on free will found that people\nseemed to have compatibilist intuitions. Participants were presented\nwith a scenario describing a deterministic universe, and then asked\nwhether a person in the scenario was free and morally responsible\n(Nahmias et al. 2006). In one case, participants were asked to imagine\na future scenario in which there is a supercomputer that is capable of\npredicting all future human behavior when provided with a complete\ndescription of the universe along with the laws of nature. In this\nscenario, a man robs a bank, and participants are asked whether the\nman is morally responsible for his action. Somewhat surprisingly, most\nparticipants gave compatibilist answers, saying that the person was\nmorally blameworthy. This basic finding held across a number of\nscenarios.\n\nIn these early studies on intuitions about free will and moral\nresponsibility, the description of determinism focused on the fact\nthat in a deterministic universe, every event is in principle\npredictable from the past and the laws. In addition, the scenarios\ninvolved particular agents in our world doing bad things. Later\nstudies emphasized the causal nature of\ndeterminism\u2014that what happens at a given point is completely\ncaused by what happened previously\u2014and stressed that what\nhappens in a deterministic universe is inevitable given the\npast. Even with this description of determinism, participants still\ntend to say that a specific concrete individual in such a universe who\ncommits a heinous crime is free and responsible (Nichols & Knobe\n2007; Roskies & Nichols 2008). However, when asked a more abstract\nquestion about whether it is possible in general for people in such a\ndeterministic universe to be free and responsible, participants tend\nto say that morally responsibility is not possible in a deterministic\nuniverse. This incompatibilist response was also found in a cross\ncultural sample with participants from India, Hong Kong, Colombia, and\nthe United States (Sarkissian et al. 2010). In addition to the\nabstract nature of the question, another important element seems to be\nwhether one is considering an alternate deterministic universe or\ncontemplating the possibility that our own universe is deterministic.\nWhen led to consider our own universe as deterministic, participants\nwere more likely to say that people would still be morally responsible\n(Roskies & Nichols 2008).\n\nThus, it seems like people give compatibilist responses under some\nconditions and incompatibilist responses under others. One reaction to\nthis apparent inconsistency is to treat one set of responses as\ndefective. Some experimental philosophers maintain that it\u2019s the\nincompatibilist responses that don\u2019t reflect people\u2019s true\njudgments. The best developed version of this view maintains people\naren\u2019t affirming incompatibilist responses at all (Nahmias &\nMurray 2011; Murray & Nahmias 2014). Instead, when people deny\nfree will and responsibility it\u2019s because they misunderstand the\ndescription of determinism. In particular, people mistakenly interpret\nthe description of determinism to mean that our mental states lack\ncausal efficacy, that the production of our behavior\n\u201cbypasses\u201d our mental states. That is, on this view,\npeople wrongly think that determinism means that a person will behave\nas she does regardless of what she thinks, wants, or intends (Murray\n& Nahmias 2014).\n\nOf course, if people\u2019s mental states have no impact on their\nbehavior, that is an excellent reason to think that people\naren\u2019t morally responsible for their behaviors. So, if people\ninterpret determinism to mean bypassing, it is perfectly\nrational for them to infer the lack of free will and responsibility\nfrom bypassing. However, it seems to be a flat-out confusion to\ninterpret determinism as bypassing. Even if determinism is true, our\nbehavior might be caused (not bypassed) by our mental states. Thus, if\npeople give incompatibilist responses because they confuse determinism\nwith bypassing, then people\u2019s responses don\u2019t reflect a\nreal commitment to incompatibilism.\n\nSurprisingly, people do make bypassing judgments when given a\ndescription of causal determinism. For instance, when presented with a\ndescription of a determinist universe, many participants agreed that\nin that universe, \u201cwhat a person wants has no effect on what\nthey end up doing\u201d (Murray & Nahmias 2014). This suggests\nthat people go through the following confused process: determinism\nmeans bypassing, and bypassing means no free will. If that\u2019s\nright, then the incompatibilist response really is a confusion.\nHowever, another explanation is that people think that determinism\nmeans no free will, and it\u2019s the denial of free will that leads\nto the bypassing judgments. The idea would be roughly that if we\ndon\u2019t have free will, then in some way our mental states\ndon\u2019t lead to our behavior in the way we had thought. Some\nexperimental philosophers have used statistical causal modeling to try\nto tease these two possibilities apart, arguing that it\u2019s the\nlatter explanation that is the right one (Bj\u00f6rnsson 2014; Rose\n& Nichols 2013). That is, people take determinism to entail that\nthere is no free will, and it is this judgment that there is no free\nwill that leads to the bypassing judgment.\n\nThus, there is some reason to think that incompatibilist responses do\nreflect many people\u2019s intuitions. What about the compatibilist\nresponses? Some experimental philosophers maintain that it is these\njudgments that are distorted. On one view, the distortion is caused by\nemotional reactions (e.g., Nichols & Knobe 2007). However, a\nmeta-analysis indicates that there is very little evidence that\nemotions play a critical role in generating compatibilist judgments\n(Feltz & Cova 2014). A different argument for demoting\ncompatibilist judgments holds that many people who affirm free\nwill in deterministic scenarios lack any sensitivity to compatibilist\nconsiderations, but instead will affirm free will even under\nfatalistic conditions in which it is explicitly stipulated that\nJohn\u2019s behavior is inevitable \u201cregardless of the past\nevents in John\u2019s life and the laws of nature\u201d. (This view\nis dubbed \u201cfree will no matter what\u201d; Feltz & Millan\n2015.) One line of argument based on these results is that if\npeople\u2019s attributions of free will are so insensitive, it can\nhardly be said that people appreciate the consistency of free will and\ndeterminism. However, subsequent studies found that in these\nfatalistic scenarios, subjects who affirmed free will still tended to\nthink that the source of the action was in the agent, in harmony with\n\u201csource compatibilism\u201d (Andow & Cova 2016).\n\nThus, the state of the evidence currently suggests that people do have\nboth incompatibilist and compatibilist intuitions. Future empirical\nwork might uncover more clearly what factors and processes draws\npeople in one direction or the other. There are also open questions\nabout whether the role of different psychological mechanisms in\nintuitions about free will has implications for philosophical\nquestions for whether we are truly free and responsible.\n2.3 Impact of Moral Judgment\n\nIt is common to distinguish between two kinds of judgments that people\nmake about morally significant situations. On one hand, people can\nmake straightforwardly moral judgments (e.g., judgments about\nmoral wrongness, about obligation, about blameworthiness). On the\nother, they can make judgments that might be morally relevant but that\nstill appear to be in some important sense non-moral\njudgments (about whether the agent acted intentionally, whether\nshe caused certain outcomes, whether she knew what she was doing). A\nquestion now arises as to how to understand the relationship between\nthese two different kinds of judgments.\n\nOne possible view would be that the relationship is entirely\nunidirectional. Thus, it might be thought that (a) people\u2019s\nmoral judgments depend on prior non-moral judgments, but (b)\npeople\u2019s non-moral judgments do not depend on prior\nmoral judgments. We can illustrate this view with the example of the\nrelationship between people\u2019s moral judgments and their\nintentional action judgments. It seems clear that people\u2019s moral\njudgments about whether an agent is deserving of blame might depend on\nprior non-moral judgments about whether this agent acted\nintentionally. However, one might think that things do not go in the\nopposite direction. It is not as though your non-moral judgment that\nthe agent acted intentionally could depend on a prior moral judgment\nthat her action was wrong.\n\nAlthough this view might seem intuitively compelling, a series of\nstudies in experimental philosophy have called it into question. These\nstudies suggest that people\u2019s moral judgments can impact their\njudgments even about what might appear to be entirely non-moral\nquestions. Such results have been obtained for a wide variety of\ndifferent apparently non-moral judgments. \n\n When an agent knows that she will bring about an outcome but is\nnot specifically trying to bring it about, people are more inclined to\nsay that she brought it about intentionally when it is\nmorally bad than when it is morally good (Knobe 2003).\n When an agent correctly believes that an outcome will arise but\nis only correct in this belief as the result of a coincidence, people\nare more inclined to say that she has knowledge when the\noutcome is morally bad than when it is morally good (Beebe & Shea\n2013; Buckwalter 2014).\n When an agent has a lot of positive emotion and a high opinion of\nher life, people are less inclined to say that she is truly\nhappy when her life is morally bad than when it is morally\ngood (Phillips, Nyholm & Liao 2014).\n When a number of different factors are each individually\nnecessary for an outcome to arise, people are more inclined to regard\none of the factors as a cause when it is morally bad than\nwhen it is morally good (Alicke 1992; Hitchcock & Knobe\n2009).\n\n\nEffects of moral judgment have also been observed on numerous other\njudgments, including everything from action individuation (Ulatowski,\n2012) to attributions of weakness of will (May & Holton 2012) to\nthe semantics of gradable adjectives (Egr\u00e9 & Cova\n2015).\n\nThese findings might be philosophically relevant at two different\nlevels. On one hand, each individual effect might be relevant to\nphilosophical work that aims to understand the corresponding concept\nor property. Thus, the findings about intentional action judgments\nmight be relevant to philosophical work about intentional action,\nthose about happiness judgments might be relevant to philosophical\nwork about happiness, and so forth. At the same time, the general\nfinding that moral judgment has this pervasive influence might be\nrelevant to philosophical work that focuses on the human mind and the\nway people make sense of the world. For example, these findings could\nhelp us to understand the nature of folk psychology or the\nrelationship between our ordinary folk theories and more systematic\nscientific theories.\n\nTo make progress on these two issues, research has focused on trying\nto understand why these effects arise. That is, researchers have aimed\nto provide hypotheses about the precise cognitive processes that give\nrise to the patterns observed in people\u2019s judgments. These\nhypotheses then, in turn, have implications for philosophical\nquestions both about specific concepts and properties and about the\nhuman mind.\n\nExisting research has led to a proliferation of hypotheses, drawing on\ntheoretical frameworks from a variety of fields (see Cova 2016 for a\nreview of seventeen hypotheses about the intentional action effect).\nStill, although there are numerous distinct specific hypotheses, it\nseems that the basic approaches can be grouped into four broad\nfamilies.\n\nFirst, it might be that the effect is not truly driven by moral\njudgment. Existing studies show that people make different\njudgments depending on whether the agent is doing something helpful or\nharmful, but of course, there are many differences between helpful and\nharmful actions other than their moral status. For example, a number\nof researchers have argued that the effect is in fact driven by\npeople\u2019s beliefs about the mental states of the agents in the\nvignettes (Sloman, Fernbach & Ewing 2012; Sripada & Konrath\n2011). Agents will tend to have different sorts of mental states when\nthey are doing something helpful than when they are doing something\nharmful, and it might be that this difference in mental states is\ndriving all of the observed effects.\n\nSecond, it might be that the effect is indeed driven by moral judgment\nbut that it is the result of an error. On this view, moral\nconsiderations do not play any real role in the concepts at work here\n(people\u2019s concepts of intentional action, of happiness, etc.).\nRather, people\u2019s judgments are being biased or distorted by some\nfurther process which gets in the way of their ability to correctly\napply their own concepts. For example, some researchers have argued\nthat the effect is due to a process of motivated cognition (Alicke,\nRose & Bloom 2011). People believe the agent to be blameworthy and\nwant to justify that belief. This desire to justify blame then\ndistorts their judgments about what might seem to be purely factual\nmatters.\n\nThird, it might be that the effect is driven by moral judgment and\ndoesn\u2019t involve an error but nonetheless simply reflects a\nfact about how people use words, rather than a fact about their\napplication of the corresponding concepts. Researchers often make\ninferences from facts about how people use certain words\n(\u2018intentionally,\u2019 \u2018happy,\u2019\n\u2018knows\u2019) about how people apply the corresponding concepts\n(the concept of intentional action, of happiness, of knowledge).\nHowever, it is also possible for factors to influence the use of our\nwords without influencing the use of these concepts, and some\nresearchers have suggested that this is the process at work in the\npresent effects. For example, it has been suggested that these effects\narise as a result of conversational pragmatics, with people trying to\navoid the pragmatic implicatures that would be generated by making\ncertain claims that are in fact literally true (Adams & Steadman\n2004). Alternatively, it has been suggested that the relevant words\n(e.g., \u2018intentionally\u2019) are actually associated with more\nthan one different concept and that the impact of morality arises not\nbecause morality plays a role in any of these concepts but rather\nbecause it plays a role in the way people resolve the ambiguity of the\nword itself (Nichols & Ulatowski 2007). On these sorts of views,\npeople are not necessarily making a mistake when their use of language\nis impacted by moral judgment, but all the same, moral judgment is not\nplaying a role in their more basic capacities to make sense of the\nworld.\n\nFourth, it might be that moral judgment actually plays a role in\npeople\u2019s basic capacities to apply the relevant concepts.\nFor example, it has been argued that the concept of happiness is\nitself a value-laden concept (Phillips et al. 2014). Similarly, it has\nbeen suggested the concepts of intentional action and causation make\nuse of a form of counterfactual thinking in which moral judgments play\na key role (Icard, Kominsky & Knobe 2017; Phillips, Luguri &\nKnobe 2015). On this last view, the effects observed in these\nexperiments point to a genuine role for moral judgment in the most\nbasic capacities underlying people\u2019s application of the relevant\nconcepts.\n\nDebates between these rival views remain ongoing. Within the more\nrecent literature, discussion of these questions has become\nincreasingly interdisciplinary, with many of the key contributions\nturning to methods from cognitive neuroscience, developmental\npsychology, or computational cognitive science.\n2.4 Epistemology\n\nWithin experimental work in epistemology, the primary focus of\nresearch has been on the patterns of people\u2019s ordinary\nattributions of knowledge. As we\u2019ve seen\n (section 2.1),\n evidence on epistemic intuitions plays a prominent role in the\nnegative program. But work in experimental epistemology has not been\ndominated by any one single issue or question. Rather, it has been\ndivided among a number of different strands of research, which have\neach been pursued separately.\n\nOne important topic has been the role of stakes in\npeople\u2019s knowledge attributions. Suppose that Keith considers\nsome available evidence and then concludes (correctly) that the bank\nwill be open on Saturday. Now consider two cases. In the\nlow-stakes case, it is not especially important whether the\nbank actually is open. By contrast, in the high-stakes case,\nKeith\u2019s whole financial future depends on whether the bank is\nopen or not. The key question now is whether this difference in stakes\nhas any impact on whether it is correct to say: \u201cKeith knows\nthat the bank will be open\u201d. \n\nWithin the non-experimental literature, philosophers have appealed to\na wide variety of arguments to help resolve this question. Although\nmany of these arguments do not directly involve people\u2019s\nintuitions about cases (Brown 2013a; see also Fantl & McGrath\n2009; Hawthorne 2004), some specifically rely on the empirical claim\nthat people would be more willing to attribute knowledge when the\nstakes are low than when the stakes are high (DeRose 1992). Among\nphilosophers who accept this empirical claim, there has been\nconsiderable debate about precisely how to explain the purported\nimpact of stakes (DeRose 1992; Hawthorne 2004; Rysiew 2001; Stanley\n2005). \n\nSurprisingly, a number of early findings from the experimental\nepistemology literature suggested that people\u2019s ordinary\nknowledge attributions actually don\u2019t depend on stakes.\nFor example, people seem to say that Keith knows the bank will be open\non Saturday not only in the low-stakes case but also in the\nhigh-stakes case (Buckwalter 2010; Feltz & Zarpentine 2010; May et\nal. 2010). This experimental finding threatens to undermine the entire\ndebate within the non-experimental epistemology literature. After all,\nif there is no effect of stakes, then there is no question as to how\nto understand this effect.\n\nSubsequent experimental work in this area has therefore focused on the\nquestion as to whether the stakes effect even exists at all. Some have\ncriticized the early experiments that did not find an effect (DeRose\n2011). Others have shown that although the effect does not emerge in\nthe experimental paradigms used by those early experiments, it does\nemerge in other paradigms (Pinillos 2012; Sripada & Stanley 2012;\nbut see Buckwalter & Schaffer 2015, for a critique). Regardless of\nhow these debates are resolved, recent experimental work seems to have\nestablished, at a very minimum, that the pattern of people\u2019s\nepistemic intuitions is not quite the way it was assumed to be within\nthe previous non-experimental literature.\n\nA second question concerns the relationship between knowledge and\nbelief. Clearly, a mental state can only count as knowledge if it\nsatisfies certain conditions that go beyond anything that would be\nrequired for the state to count as belief. Thus, there can be cases in\nwhich a person believes that p but does not know that\np. A question arises, however, as to whether the converse\nalso holds. That is, a question arises as to whether a mental state\nmust satisfy certain conditions to count as a belief that go beyond\nwhat would be required for it to count as knowledge. Can there be\ncases in which a person knows that p but does not believe\nthat p?\n\nStrikingly, a series of studies suggest that people do attribute\nknowledge in certain cases in which they would not be willing to\nattribute belief (Myers-Schulz & Schwitzgebel 2013; see also\nMurray et al. 2013; Rose & Schaffer 2013; Buckwalter et al. 2015;\nShields 2016). In one study, participants were given a vignette about\na student taking a history test who faces the question: \u201cWhat\nyear did Queen Elizabeth die?\u201d She has reviewed this date many\ntimes, but at that one moment, she is flustered by the pressure and\ncan\u2019t recall the answer. She therefore decides just to guess,\nand she writes down \u20181603.\u2019 In fact, this is the correct\nanswer. When given this vignette, experimental participants tended to\nsay that (a) the student knows that Queen Elizabeth died in\n1603 but to deny that (b) she believes that Queen Elizabeth\ndied in 1603 (Myers-Schulz & Schwitzgebel 2013, drawing on a\nvignette from Radford). Similar effects have been obtained for\nnumerous other cases (Murray et al. 2013; Rose & Schaffer 2013;\nBuckwalter et al. 2015; Shields 2016).\n\nResearch in this area aims to understand why this effect arises and\nwhat implications it has for epistemology. One view is that\npeople\u2019s concept of belief truly does involve certain conditions\nthat are not required by their concept of knowledge (Myers-Schulz\n& Schwitzgebel 2013). An alternative view is that there is more\nthan one sense of \u2018belief,\u2019 such that knowledge requires\nthe mental state picked out by one of the senses but not the other.\nWithin work that adopts this latter approach, there have been a number\nof more specific suggestions about how to spell out the difference\nbetween the two senses and what relation each has to the ordinary\nconcept of knowledge (Rose & Schaffer 2013; Buckwalter et al.\n2015).\n\nExperimental epistemology has also explored numerous other issues. A\nseries of studies indicate that people actually do attribute knowledge\nin \u2018fake barn\u2019 cases (Cola\u00e7o et al. 2014; Turri\n2017). Others show that judgments about whether a person\u2019s\nmental state counts as knowledge depend on whether that person\u2019s\nevidence comes from facts about an object itself or from statistical\nbase rates (Friedman & Turri 2015). Still others have explored\nissues at the intersection of formal semantics and epistemology,\nexploring the impact of specific linguistic factors on knowledge\nattributions (Schaffer & Szab\u00f3 2014).\n2.5 Other Topics\n\nWe have been focusing in on four specific areas in which there have\nbeen especially prominent contributions from experimental philosophy,\nbut we should emphasize that it is not as though the majority of\nexperimental philosophy research falls into one or another of these\nareas. On the contrary, research in experimental philosophy is highly\ndiverse, and it has actually been getting steadily more heterogeneous\nin recent years.\n\nFirst, experimental philosophers have been pursuing an ever more\ndiverse array of topics. On one hand, there has been a surge of\nexperimental research using more formal, mathematical tools, including\nwork on causation using Bayes nets (e.g., Livengood & Rose 2016).\nand work in formal semantics on everything from gradable adjectives to\nconditionals to epistemic modals (Liao & Meskin 2017; Cariani\n& Rips 2017; Khoo 2015). On the other, there has been a\nproliferation of work addressing core topics in the humanities,\nincluding art, religion and even questions at the intersection of\nexperimental philosophy and the history of philosophy (De Cruz &\nDe Smedt 2016; Liao et al. 2014; Nichols 2015).\n\nSecondly one finds an ever-growing diversity of experimental methods.\nThere are still plenty of studies that proceed by giving participants\nvignettes and asking for their intuitions, but in contemporary\nexperimental philosophy, one also finds studies using corpora (Reuter\n2011), reaction times (Philips & Cushman 2017), neuroimaging\n(Greene et al. 2001), even\nstudies that look at whether ethics professors actually behave\nethically (Schwitzgebel & Rust 2014).\n\nFinally, and perhaps most noticeably, there is an increasingly close\nconnection between research in experimental philosophy and research in\npsychology. For example, the experimental research program on\nintuitions about trolley problems has been dominated by contributions\nfrom psychology (e.g., Cushman et al. 2006; Wiegmann et al. 2012), but\nthere have also been important contributions from philosophers (e.g.,\nMikhail 2011; Kahane & Shackel 2008). Conversely, there have been\nnumerous recent papers in psychology that aim to contribute to\nresearch programs that originated in experimental philosophy (Samland\n& Waldmann 2016; Feldman & Chandrashekar forthcoming; Starmans\n& Friedman 2012). \n3. Challenges to Experimental Philosophy\n\nAs is the case with any healthy research area, there is lots of\ndispute about issues within experimental philosophy. There are\ndisagreements about particular studies, the implications of different\nkinds of results, and so on. But there are also broad challenges to\nthe very idea that experimental philosophy research could prove\nhelpful in addressing the philosophical questions. We focus here on\nthree of the most prominent of these challenges.\n3.1 Disputing the Role of Intuitions in Philosophy\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, much work in experimental philosophy presupposes\nthat intuitions play an important role in philosophical inquiry. Work\nin the negative program characteristically starts with the assumption\nthat intuitions play a central role in the philosophical tradition.\nOutside of the negative program, experimental philosophers want to\nunderstand what people\u2019s intuitions are about philosophical\nmatters and why they have these intuitions. Several philosophers,\nhowever, challenge the role of intuitions in philosophy in ways that\nalso pose a challenge to the philosophical significance of much\nexperimental philosophy.\n3.1.1 Philosophers don\u2019t rely on intuitions\n\nOne way to reject the role of intuitions is simply to deny that\nphilosophers use intuitions as justification for their views\n(Williamson 2007; Cappelen 2012; Deutsch 2009, 2010, 2015). According\nto such \u201cintuition deniers\u201d, the experimental\ninvestigation of intuitions is thoroughly irrelevant to philosophy\n(e.g., Cappelen 2012: 1; for discussion, Nado 2016). Obviously if this is right, then\nthe negative program is arguing against a thoroughly mistaken\nconception of philosophy.\n\nAlthough work in metaphilosophy often assumes that philosophers use\nintuitions as evidence, this is exactly what is challenged by\nintuition deniers. It is granted on all sides that philosophers\nsometimes mention intuitions, but according to the intuition deniers,\nintuitions are not integral to the philosophical work. In particular,\nintuition deniers maintain that a careful inspection of philosophical\npractice reveals that philosophers don\u2019t rely on intuitions to\njustify philosophical views; rather, philosophers rely on\narguments (see, e.g., Cappelen 2012: 170; Deutsch 2009:\n451).\n\nThere have been several responses to the intuition deniers, but\nperhaps the most prominent response to is that the arguments of\nintuition deniers depend on an implausibly strong conception of the\nnotion of intuition (e.g., Chalmers 2014; Devitt 2015;\nWeinberg 2014). Once we focus on a less demanding notion of intuition,\nit\u2019s plausible that philosophers often rely on intuitions as\nevidence for philosophical theses (Devitt 2015). Indeed, some have\nargued that for classic examples like Gettier cases, it\u2019s hard\nto see how the argument works if it doesn\u2019t rely on intuitions\n(see, e.g., Brown 2017; Sytsma & Livengood 2015: 92\u201393)\nExperimental philosophers have also argued against intuition deniers\non experimental grounds, noting that a recent study found that over\n50% of philosophers agree with the statement \u201cintuitions are\nuseful for justifying philosophical claims\u201d (Kuntz & Kuntz\n2011; see Sytsma & Livengood 2015: 91).\n3.1.2 Philosophers shouldn\u2019t rely on intuitions\n\nA rather different way to challenge the study of intuitions in\nexperimental philosophy is to deny that the study of intuitions is an\napt subject matter for philosophical inquiry. On this view, we can\ngrant that it\u2019s a fact that philosophers rely on intuitions, but\nit\u2019s a lamentable fact. The use of intuitions in philosophy is\nmisguided for reasons that have nothing in particular to do with\nexperimental philosophy\u2014the appeal to intuitions is a relic,\nwhich should be rejected because it doesn\u2019t actually answer the\nphilosophical questions. This conclusion threatens positive\napplications of experimental philosophy (see, e.g.,\n sections 2.2\u20132.4),\n but is of course, perfectly consistent with the conclusion urged by\nthe negative program in experimental philosophy\n (section 2.1).\n\nOne influential argument against the use of intuitions builds on the\nrejection of descriptivist theories of reference, according to which\nconcepts refer to kinds via a set of associated descriptions. In place\nof descriptivism, some maintain that concepts refer in virtue of the\nfunction of the concept (e.g., Millikan 2000). Other views maintain\nthat concepts refer in virtue of a causal chain connecting the concept\nto the kind (Putnam 1973). On these anti-descriptivist views, people\ncan have wildly mistaken intuitions regarding the application of their\nconcepts. As a result, probing lay intuitions might be an ineffective\nway to investigate the kinds of things to which our concepts refer\n(e.g., Fischer 2015; Kornblith 2002).\n\nAnti-descriptivism itself doesn\u2019t entail that appeal to\nintuitions is philosophically irrelevant. Indeed, some of the most\ninfluential arguments against descriptivist theories of reference seem\nto depend on intuitions (Devitt 2015). However, some argue that rather\nthan relying on intuitions about kinds, we should investigate the\nkinds themselves. So, if the concept knowledge picks out a\nnatural kind, we can consult the distribution and characteristics of\nknowledge as it is instantiated in the world. Using intuitions to\nunderstand knowledge would be like using intuitions to\nunderstand gold. The way we come to understand the nature of\ngold is to examine samples of gold rather than people\u2019s\nintuitions about gold. Similarly, the way to understand\nknowledge is to examine samples of knowledge as it presents\nin animals, rather than people\u2019s intuitions about knowledge\n(Kornblith 2002). To examine knowledge by intuitions is at best\ninefficient, and at worst a complete distraction from the task of\nunderstanding what knowledge is. This objection is primarily directed\nat traditional forms of conceptual analysis, but insofar as\nexperimental philosophy focuses on intuitions, it is in the same leaky\nboat (Kornblith 2013: 197).\n\nThe claim that philosophers shouldn\u2019t rely on intuitions\nconstitutes a broad attack on conceptual analysis, in both its\ntraditional and experimental guises. Not surprisingly, there have been\nseveral defenses of the importance of intuitions for doing philosophy.\nFor instance, some philosophers argue that in order even to pick out\nthe kind of interest, we need to rely on our intuitive sense of what\nbelongs in the category (e.g., Goldman 2015). To determine the\ncharacteristics of knowledge, we need to have a way of picking out\nwhich items are genuine members of the kind, and for this we must rely\non our intuitive understanding of knowledge. In addition, if we reject\noutright the appeal to what intuitively belongs to a category,\nit\u2019s hard to make sense of the intelligibility of eliminativism\n(e.g., Berm\u00fadez 2006: 305), since eliminativists typically\nargue that there is a mismatch between intuitive notions of, e.g.,\nfree will, and the kinds of things in the world. To give up on the\nsignificance of characterizing our intuitive commitments is to\npreemptively exclude eliminativist views, which have long been\nregarded as of central philosophical interest.\n3.2 Defending Privileged Intuitions Rather Than Those of Ordinary Experimental Participants\n\nA second objection would be that even if intuitions do matter, we\nshould not be concerned with just any old kind of intuition. Rather,\nour concern should be with a distinctive class of intuitions.\nFor example, research in philosophy has traditionally been conducted\nby trained philosophers who spent years thinking about difficult\nproblems. There is good reason to suspect that the intuitions\ngenerated by this type of process will have a special sort of\nepistemic status, and perhaps these sorts of intuitions can play a\nlegitimate role in philosophy. By contrast, the intuitions explored\nwithin experimental philosophy research tend to be those of ordinary\nfolks, with no prior background in philosophy, and one might think\nthat intuitions of this latter type have no real philosophical\nsignificance.\n\nOne way of spelling out this concern is in terms of what has come to\nbe known as the expertise objection. The key contention here\nis that trained philosophers have a distinctive type of expertise.\nThus, if we want to understand the process at the core of traditional\nphilosophical practice, we need to study people who have this type of\nexpertise. It is no good just looking at the judgments of people who\nhave never taken a single philosophy course. A number of philosophers\nhave developed objections along more or less these lines though with\nimportant differences (Williamson 2007; Ludwig 2007).\n\nThis is an important objection, and to address it, experimental\nphilosophers launched a major effort to study the intuitions of\ntrained philosophers. The results show that trained philosophers still\nshow order effects (Schwitzgebel & Cushman 2012), actor/observer\neffects (Tobia et al. 2013), and effects of temperament (Schulz,\nCokely, & Feltz 2011). Thus, existing work provides at least some\nevidence against the claim that trained philosophers have a\ndistinctive expertise that allows them to escape the sorts of biases\nthat plague the judgments of ordinary folks.\n\nOf course, there are numerous ways of defending the objection against\nthis type of response. It could be argued that although philosophers\ndo not have an ability to avoid biases of the type studied within\nexperimental philosophy, their judgments do differ from those of\nordinary folks in some other important respect. Similarly, it could be\nargued that what gives certain intuitions their privileged epistemic\nstate is not the fact that they come from a particular type of person\n(trained philosophers) but rather the fact that they are the product\nof a particular way of approaching the question (sustained reflection)\n(see, e.g., Kauppinen 2007).\n3.3 But is it Philosophy?\n\nFinally, it might be objected that experimental philosophy simply\nisn\u2019t philosophy at all. On this view, there are certain\nproperties that differentiate work in philosophy from work in other\ndisciplines. Research in experimental philosophy lacks these\nproperties and is therefore best understood as falling outside the\nphilosophical tradition entirely. Note that this last objection is not\nconcerned with the question as to whether experimental philosophy has\nany value but rather with the question as to whether it should be\nconsidered part of a particular discipline. As one recent paper puts\nit, \n\n\n\u2026 what is at issue is not whether there is room for such\nempirical study, but whether there is room for it now as a branch of\nphilosophy. (Sorell forthcoming: 6)\n\n\nIn actual practice, debate over this objection has tended to focus on\nquestions in the history of philosophy. Clearly, numerous philosophers\nfrom Aristotle through Nietzsche were deeply concerned with empirical\nquestions about human nature, so it might seem that the default view,\nat least in the absence of any counterarguments, should be that work\non these issues can indeed count as philosophy. The key question,\nthen, is whether there are any legitimate counterarguments.\n\nOne possible argument would be that although the people we now regard\nas philosophers did work on these issues, this aspect of their work\nshould not be regarded as falling within the discipline of philosophy.\nAnthony Appiah questions this gambit:\n\n\nYou would have a difficult time explaining to most of the canonical\nphilosophers that this part of the work was echt\nphilosophy and that part of their work was not. Trying to\nseparate out the \u201cmetaphysical\u201d from the\n\u201cpsychological\u201d elements in this corpus is like trying to\npeel a raspberry. (Appiah 2008: 13)\n\n\nAccording to this response, there is a well-established practice\nwithin the history of philosophy of exploring empirical and\npsychological questions, and it is actually the idea of carefully\nseparating the psychological from the philosophical that should be\nregarded as a departure from philosophical tradition.\n\nMore recent work on these issues has been concerned especially with\nthe early modern period. It has been noted that some of the most\nprominent philosophers in this period actually conducted experimental\nstudies (Sytsma & Livengood 2015), and some explicitly referred to\nthemselves as \u2018experimental philosophers\u2019 (Anstey &\nVanzo 2016). Though contemporary experimental philosophy obviously\ndiffers in certain respects from these historical antecedents, one\nmight argue that the work of contemporary experimental philosophers is\nbest understood as a continuation of this broad historical\ntradition.\n\nOn the other side, it has been argued that this historical continuity\npicture fails to take account of a change in the use of the word\n\u2018philosophy\u2019 (Sorell forthcoming). In the Renaissance,\nphysics was referred to as \u2018philosophy,\u2019 but we would not\nsay that all research in contemporary physics belongs in the\ndiscipline of philosophy. Similarly, even if work on the psychology of\nmoral judgment was historically classified as philosophy, one might\nthink that it should not be regarded today as falling into the\ndiscipline of philosophy but rather into a distinct discipline.\n\nCertainly, partisans on both sides of this debate should agree that\nthe boundaries of a discipline can change over time, but this point\ncuts both ways. Just as the boundaries of a discipline may have\nchanged in the past, they can change in the future. It will therefore\nbe interesting to see how the boundaries of the discipline of\nphilosophy evolve over the course of the next few decades and how this\nevolution impacts the status of experimental philosophy.",
