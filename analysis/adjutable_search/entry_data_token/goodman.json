Life\nHenry Nelson Goodman was born on August 7, 1906, in Somerville,\nMassachusetts (USA), to Sarah Elizabeth (Woodbury) Goodman and Henry\nL.  Goodman. In the 1920s he enrolled at Harvard University and\nstudied under\n Clarence Irving Lewis (who later became his Ph.D. supervisor),\n Alfred North Whitehead, \nHarry Scheffer, W.E. Hooking, and Ralph Barton Perry.  Goodman\ngraduated from Harvard in 1928. It took him, however, 12 more years\nuntil he finished his Ph.D. in 1941 with A Study of Qualities\n(SQ). There are several possible reasons for the lateness of his\nPh.D. Maybe the most important was that Goodman was Jewish, and\ntherefore not eligible for a graduate fellowship at Harvard (Schwartz\n1999; Elgin 2000a; Scholz 2005). He had to work outside the university\nto finance his studies. From 1928 until 1940, Goodman worked as the\ndirector of the Walker-Goodman Art Gallery at Copley Square,\nBoston. This interest and activity in the artworld is more frequently\ncited as a reason for the lateness of his Ph.D. During his graduate\nstudies Goodman was also a regular participant in W.V. Quine\u2019s\nseminars on the philosophy of the\n Vienna Circle \n(in particular of Rudolf Carnap). Goodman also worked closely with\nHenry Leonard, who wrote his Ph.D. at the same time under Alfred North\nWhitehead\u2019s supervision. After military service, Goodman taught\nbriefly as \u201cinstructor in philosophy\u201d at Tufts College,\nand was then hired as associate professor (1946\u201351) and later as\nfull professor (1951\u201364) at the University of Pennsylvania. He\nserved briefly as Harry Austryn Wolfson Professor of Philosophy at\nBrandeis University (1964\u201367), finally returning to Harvard in\n1968, where he taught philosophy until 1977. At Harvard, he\nfounded Project-Zero, a center to study and improve education\nin the arts. Besides being an art gallery director as a graduate\nstudent, and private art collector throughout his life, Goodman was\nalso involved in the production of three multimedia-performance\nevents, Hockey Seen: A Nightmare in Three Periods and\nSudden Death (1972), Rabbit, Run (1973),\nand Variations: An Illustrated Lecture Concert (1985) (Carter\n2000, 2009).\nGoodman was more interested in solving philosophical problems than\nin his celebrity as a philosopher. He authorized only two interviews\n(Goodman 1980, 2005), did not write an autobiography, and rejected the\ninvitation to be honored with a volume in the prestigious Schilpp\nLibrary of Living Philosophers (Elgin 2000a, 2). Sparse bits of\ninformation about his personal life can only be gathered from the\nautobiographies of his contemporaries and their published\ncorrespondences (e.g., Quine 1985; Creath 1990) or his obituaries\n(e.g., Carter 2000; Elgin 1999 (Other Internet Resources), 2000a,\n2000b; Elgin et al. 1999; Mitchell 1999; Scheffler 2001; Scholz 2005;\nSchwartz 1999). Goodman died on November 25, 1998, in Needham,\nMassachusetts, at the age of 92, after a stroke.\n2. Anti-Absolutism\nNelson Goodman\u2019s philosophy synthesizes German/Austrian Logical\nEmpiricism, as developed and practiced by philosophers like Rudolf\nCarnap and Carl Hempel, with American Pragmatism of the kind practiced\nand advocated by C.I. Lewis. Goodman, however, departs from both\ntraditions considerably. As we will see, he departs from Lewis\u2019s\npragmatism in dismissing the idea of an indubitable given in\nexperience. He departs from logical empiricism in giving up a\nprincipled analytic/synthetic distinction.\n2.1 The Myth of the Given in Experience\nGoodman\u2019s philosophy\u2014especially his epistemology\u2014is\nusually considered to be in opposition to the philosophy of the\nLogical Positivists, and of Rudolf Carnap in particular. But this\ncharacterization overlooks an important continuity between the\nphilosophy of the Logical Positivists and Goodman\u2019s work. The received\nview, that Goodman\u2019s main work, The Structure of Appearance\nwas intended as an anti-foundationalist reconception of\nCarnap\u2019s Der logische Aufbau der Welt (cf. Elgin 2001;\nHellman 1977) is particularly misleading here.\nIn fact, Goodman was quite aware that Carnap\u2019s work was itself\nanti-foundationalist in the same respect as his. Already in his\ndissertation thesis A Study of Qualities (which was later\ndeveloped into The Structure of Appearance), Goodman\nwrites:\n\n[\u2026] Carnap has made it clear that what we take as ground\nelements [for a constitutional system] is a matter of choice. They are\nnot dignified as the atomic units from which others must be built;\nthey simply constitute one possible starting point. [\u2026] In\nchoosing erlebs, Carnap is plainly seeking to approximate as closely\nas possible what he regards the original epistemological state\n[\u2026] Yet whether it does so or not is no test of the\nsystem. [\u2026] Hence [\u2026] argument concerning whether the\nelements selected are really primitive in knowledge is extraneous to\nthe major purpose of the system. (SQ, 96\u201398)\n\nThe quote makes it obvious that Goodman himself did not consider\nhis constructionalist approach in A Study of Qualities as an\nepistemological alternative to Carnap\u2019s. Insofar as criticism of a\nfoundationalist epistemology does play a role in The Structure of\nAppearance or A Study of Qualities, this criticism was\nrather directed at the philosophy of C.I. Lewis, who was Goodman\u2019s\nteacher at Harvard. Lewis indeed held the view that empiricism must\npresuppose the incorrigibility and indubitability of what is given in\nexperience. According to Lewis, I might need to revise, for example,\nthat I saw a plane crossing the sky when I learn that what I mistook\nfor a plane was Superman. However, nothing can make me revise that\nthere was a blue and a red spot in the center of my visual field that\nthen led to the (false) belief that there was a plane.\nA Study of Qualities, on the other hand, begins with the\nargument that even the simplest judgments of this sort\u2014as the\none about a blue and a red spot in the center of my visual\nfield\u2014might be revised in the light of new evidence. My judgment\nthat I had a blue spot in the middle of my visual field a few seconds\nago when I looked at a ripe apple under normal conditions might be\nrevised when I now judge that I have a red spot in my visual field,\nlooking at the same object under the same conditions and know that it\ncould not have changed its color. However, if such revisions can be\nmade in retrospect, nothing of the \u201cgiven\u201d is indubitable\nor incorrigible. Judgments about qualia, in this sense, are decrees;\nwhich judgments are accepted is a matter of the overall coherence of\nmy system of beliefs and my other qualia judgments. \n\nThe literal unverifiabilty of such quale-recognition is,\nnevertheless, in the last analysis beyond question. If I say the green\npresented by that grass now is the same as the green presented by it\nat a certain past moment, I cannot truly verify that statement because\nI cannot revive that past moment. The statement therefore constitutes\nan arbitrary and supreme decree. But a decree, simply because it is\narbitrary, is not therefore necessarily haphazard. My\nquale-identifications are influenced; I do not feel equally inclined\nto identify the color presented by the grass now with the color\npresented by a cherry a moment ago, though such a decree if made would\nbe equally supreme and unchallengeable on strict grounds. We are all\nmuch in the same position of absolute but sane monarchs; our\npronouncements are law, but we use our heads in making them. (SQ, 17;\ncmp. SA (2nd ed.), 134)\n\nAlso in this respect Goodman is following Carnap and the logical\nempiricists. C.I. Lewis emphasizes this in his \u201cLogical\nPositivism and Pragmatism\u201d (Lewis 1941). There he explains that\nthe main difference between the empiricism of the pragmatists and the\nempiricism of the logical positivists (especially the Carnap\nof Philosophy and Logical Syntax (1935)) is that the latter\nwere ready to analyze empirical knowledge fully in the so-called\n\u201cformal mode\u201d. Accordingly, they analyze empirical\nknowledge as more or less coherent systems of accepted sentences, some\nof which are \u201cprotocols\u201d, some are sentences of\nmathematics and logic, some are generalizations, etc. In particular,\nthe formal mode would not distinguish between statements such as\n\u201cThis object looks red\u201d and \u201cThis object is\nred\u201d.\nFor Lewis, this sort of empiricism is not worthy of the name. After\nall, the experiential element does not seem to show up at all in this\nkind of formal analysis. Lewis claims instead that a proper empiricism\nmust treat sentences of the form \u201cThis looks red.\u201d as\nspecial, indubitable statements. We might err when classifying things\nas being red, but we cannot err when it comes to recognizing things as\nlooking red. This is \u201cthe given\u201d in experience, the\nphenomenal states we find ourselves in when making\nexperiences. Without such an indubitable element, Lewis fears that our\nepistemology would necessarily collapse into a coherence theory of\ntruth (Lewis 1952).  Goodman, on the other hand, is ready to bite that\nbullet when throwing away the indubitable given. Lewis, the major\nadvocate of pragmatism, comments on this move by Goodman that his\n\u201cproposal is, I fear, a little more pragmatic than I dare to\nbe\u201d (Lewis 1952, 118).\nIndeed, Goodman\u2019s early and later philosophy is\nanti-foundationalist. This is truly a characteristic of his work on\ninduction, metaphysics, logic and even the languages of art. It\nshould, however, not be interpreted as a counter program to logical\npositivism.  What Goodman did\u2014in all these areas\u2014is better\nunderstood as a continuation and enlargement of Carnap\u2019s program. This\nis obvious if we consider Goodman\u2019s relativism and irrealism. It is\nalso apparent when we think about his pluralism in logic and his\ninsistence that there are more cognitively valuable representation\nsystems than just the sciences, namely the languages of\nart. His anti-foundationalism therefore is more than just a\nrestatement that there is no \u201cbedrock\u201d for\nknowledge\u2014as was argued by Karl Popper and Otto Neurath,\nbut also that there are no fundamental ontological objects, that there\nare no fundamental logical principles, and that there are no\nprivileged representation systems.  All of these echo Rudolf Carnap\u2019s\nfamous Principles of Tolerance (Carnap 1934): tolerance with regards\nto ontology, to logical principles, and to representation systems in\ngeneral. \n2.2 The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction and Likeness of Meaning\nGoodman did, however, considerably depart from the logical\npositivists in denying the comprehensibility of the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction. This rejection and Goodman\u2019s gradual account of synonymy\n(or, rather, likeness of meaning) developed out of an exchange of\nletters between Morton White, Quine, and Goodman, which is also the\nhistorical background of Quine\u2019s famous \u201cTwo Dogmas of\nEmpiricism\u201d (Quine 1951a).\nOn 25 May 1947, Morton White wrote a letter to Quine asking for\nadvice on a paper in which he tried to deal with a solution to C.H.\nLangford\u2019s paradox of analysis proposed by Alonzo Church. White was\nespecially unhappy with Church\u2019s invocation of abstract objects in\norder to explicate the notion of synonymy. White sent his\ndiscontentment with the proposed solution to Quine (White\u2019s original\npaper appeared in print in 1948 under the title \u201cOn the\nChurch\u2013Frege Solution of the Paradox of Analysis\u201d) and\nthen sent Quine\u2019s answer to Goodman. In 1947 the three discussed the\nmatter by letter, until White was eventually chosen to write a survey\nof their discussion, which appeared in 1950 under the title \u201cThe\nAnalytic and the Synthetic: An Untenable Dualism\u201d. Quine\npresented his view on the matter in an address to the American\nPhilosophical Association, which was published in 1951 as \u201cTwo\nDogmas of Empiricism\u201d (Quine 1951a).\nAt that time the postulation of new abstract objects, such as\nFregean senses or other intensional objects, in order to explicate a\ncertain notion of synonymy seemed an unacceptable move for someone\nwith nominalist leanings such as Quine and a purist such as White. For\nQuine, an explication of \u201csynonymy\u201d or\n\u201canalyticity\u201d and the like should rather be given in\nbehavioristic terms. The explication should tell us in what way\n\u201canalyticity\u201d and \u201csynonymy\u201d make a difference\nin speaker behavior. To learn that the difference lies in postulated\nabstract objects did not seem to explicate the notions in any\npromising way.\nGoodman\u2019s original discontentment with the whole situation was more\nserious. In a letter to White and Quine he claimed that not only did\nhe find the explications of \u201csynonymy\u201d and\n\u201canalyticity\u201d so far provided to be problematic, but he\ndid not even understand what these terms were supposed to mean\npre-theoretically:\n\nWhen I say I don\u2019t understand the meaning of \u201canalytic\u201d\nI mean that very literally. I mean that I don\u2019t even know how to apply\nthe terms. I do not accept the analogy with the problem of defining,\nsay, confirmation. I don\u2019t understand what confirmation is, or let us\nsay projectibility, in the sense that I can\u2019t frame any adequate\ndefinition; but give me any predicate and (usually) I can tell you\nwhether it is projectible or not. I understand the term in\nextension. But \u201canalytic\u201d I don\u2019t even understand this\nfar; give me a sentence and I can\u2019t tell you whether it is analytic\nbecause I haven\u2019t even implicit criteria\u2026. I can\u2019t look for a\ndefinition when I don\u2019t know what it is I am defining. (Goodman in a\nletter to Quine and White, 2 July 1947, in White 1999, 347)\n\nGoodman\u2019s remark is instructive, since it undermines a move that\nGrice and Strawson would later make against Quine\u2019s argumentation in\n\u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism\u201d. In their \u201cIn Defense of\na Dogma\u201d (Grice and Strawson 1956) they argue that Quine\u2019s\nskepticism about the analytic-synthetic distinction as such is\nundermotivated in light of our pre-theoretic grasp of the\ndistinction. Goodman\u2019s claim is that there in fact is no such\npre-theoretic grasp of the distinction.\nThe official result of the exchange between White, Goodman, and\nQuine was that any sharp analytic-synthetic distinction is\nuntenable and should just be abandoned:\n\nI think that the problem is clear, and that all considerations\npoint to the need for dropping the myth of a sharp distinction between\nessential and accidental predication (to use the language of the older\nAristotelians) as well as its contemporary formulation\u2014the sharp\ndistinction between analytic and synthetic. (White 1950, 330)\n\nGoodman\u2019s view on the matter had already appeared in print in 1949\nunder the title \u201cOn Likeness of Meaning\u201d. In this paper\nGoodman proposes a purely extensional analysis of meaning, the upshot\nof which is that no two different expressions in a language are\nsynonymous. He discusses several objections to theories of meaning\nthat rely on intensional entities (such as, for example, Fregean\nsenses) to explicate the notion of synonymy in non-circular ways, such\nthat the question of whether two terms are \u201csynonymous\u201d is\ncomprehensible as well as scrutable. Goodman eventually rejects\nintensional approaches and opts for an extensional theory for sameness\nof meaning. According to such an extensional theory, two expressions\nhave the same meaning if and only if they have the same\nextension. This criterion is certainly intelligible, but also\nscrutable; we can\ndecide by induction, conjecture, or other means\nthat two predicates have the same extension without knowing exactly\nall the things they apply to. (PP, 225)\nBut an extensional theory is, of course, not thereby free of\nproblems. Consider, for example, the expression \u201cunicorn\u201d\nand \u201ccentaur\u201d, which have the same extension (namely the\nnull-extension) but differ in meaning. Hence, whereas sameness of\nextension is a necessary condition for sameness of meaning, sameness\nof extension does not seem to be sufficient for sameness of meaning.\nGoodman proposes an extensional fix to this problem that gives\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for sameness of meaning. He\nobserves that although \u201cunicorn\u201d and \u201ccentaur\u201d\nhave the same extension, simply because of the trivial fact that they\ndenote nothing, \u201ccentaur-picture\u201d and\n\u201cunicorn-picture\u201d do have different extensions. Clearly,\nnot all centaur-pictures are unicorn-pictures and vice\nversa. Thus the flight to compounds makes an extensional\ncriterion possible:\n[I]f we call the extension of a predicate by\nitself its primary extension, and the extension of its compounds as\nsecondary extension, the thesis is as follows: Two terms have the same\nmeaning iff they have the same primary and secondary extensions. (PP,\n227)\n The primary extensions of \u201cunicorn\u201d\n and \u201ccentaur\u201d are the same (the null-extension), but\n their secondary extensions do differ: the compounds\n \u201cunicorn-picture\u201d and \u201ccentaur-picture\u201d\n differ in extension.\nIf we allow all kinds of compounds equally, we arrive immediately\nat the result that by our new criterion no two different expressions\nhave the same meaning. Consider the expressions \u201cbachelor\u201d\nand \u201cunmarried man\u201d: \u201cis a bachelor but not an\nunmarried man\u201d is a bachelor description that is not an\nunmarried-man description. Hence, by Goodman\u2019s criterion, the\nsecondary extensions of \u201cbachelor\u201d and \u201cunmarried\nman\u201d differ because the primary extensions of at least one of\ntheir compounds do. Since the same trick can be pulled with any two\nexpressions, Goodman is left with the result that no two different\nexpressions are synonymous, but he is ready to bite this bullet.\nP-descriptions that are not Q-descriptions are easy to construct for\nany P and Q (provided these are different terms) and\nthese constructions might well be relatively uninteresting. If only\nsuch uninteresting constructs are available to make a difference in\nsecondary extension, P and Q, despite being not strictly\nsynonymous, might be more synonymous than a pair of predicates for\nwhich we are able to find interesting compounds (as in the case of\n\u201ccentaur\u201d and \u201cunicorn\u201d). This turns sameness\nof meaning of different terms into likeness of meaning, and synonymy\nand analyticity into a matter of degree.\n\n3. Nominalism and Mereology\n3.1 Nominalisms\n\u201cNominalism\u201d can refer to a variety of different,\nalbeit related, positions. In most cases, it either refers to the\nrejection of universals or of abstract objects. What nominalism means\nfor Goodman undergoes two radical changes. In his Ph.D. thesis, A\nStudy of Qualities, he uses the label \u201cnominalist\u201d to\ndescribe constructional systems whose constructional basis does not\ninclude abstracta, such as Carnap\u2019s system in the Aufbau\n(Carnap 1928). Whether classes are used in the construction, as\nCarnap\u2019s Aufbau indeed does, is irrelevant for the\ncharacterization of these systems as\n\u201cnominalist\u201d. Nominalism is not an issue of discussion\nhere; \u201cnominalist\u201d merely occurs as a classification (for\nmore details on constructional systems see\n section 4\nbelow.)\nGoodman first endorses a nominalist position in his famous joint article\nwith W.V. Quine, \u201cSteps Toward a Constructive Nominalism\u201d\n(1947). Goodman and Quine set the agenda in the very first sentence\nof the article: \u201cWe do not believe in abstract\nobjects\u201d. And they conclude the first paragraph: \u201cAny\nsystem that countenances abstract entities we deem unsatisfactory as\na final philosophy\u201d (Goodman and Quine 1947, 105).\nGoodman and Quine first discuss nominalistically acceptable\nreductions of platonist statements. \u201cPlatonist\u201d here\nrefers to the use of terms for classes, numbers, properties, and\nrelations\u2014in short, anything that is not a concrete particular. \nThe first examples are straightforward and their resolutions are\nwell-known today.  \u201cClass \\(A\\) is included in\nclass \\(B\\)\u201d can be rendered as \u201cEverything that is\nan \\(A\\) is a \\(B\\)\u201d (where \u201c\\(A\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(B\\)\u201d now stand for the appropriate predicates,\nrather than for classes). \u201cClass \\(C\\) has two\nmembers\u201d, or \u201cThe number of \\(C\\)s is 2\u201d, is\nrendered as \u201cThere are two \\(C\\)s\u201d, and spelt out\nformally (based on Russell\u2019s theory of definite \n descriptions\u2014see\n the discussion in the entry on Russell)\n as:\n\n\\[\n\n\\exists x \\exists y(x \\ne y \\land \\forall z(Cz \\equiv (z = x \\lor z = y)))\n\n\\]\n\nNo recourse to classes or other abstract entities (e.g., numbers)\nis necessary. However, this strategy does not deliver a general recipe\nto account for statements that are typically expressed in a\nstraightforward set-theoretic way. For instance, it seems to Goodman\nand Quine that there is no general recipe for expressing statements\nlike \u201cThere are more cats than dogs\u201d in a nominalistically\nacceptable fashion. If the total number of dogs were known, then, in\nprinciple, the quantifier strategy above could be used\u2014albeit\nthat, with hundreds of millions of dogs alive today, it would\ncertainly not be practical. Quine and Goodman suggest a translation\ninto the language of mereology with an additional auxiliary predicate\n\u201cbigger than\u201d; while this provides a surprisingly\nversatile solution for many cases, it is still not completely general\n(Goodman and Quine 1947, 110\u201311). Further, a general\ndefinition of the ancestral of a relation \n(as first given by Gottlob Frege 1879, \u00a726) seemed to Quine and\nGoodman at the time to be out of reach for the nominalist.  Leon\nHenkin (1962, 188\u201389) finds an elegant solution, quantifying\nover lists of successive inscriptions. Goodman later (PP, 153)\nsuggests that his technique to formulate the ancestral of matching\n(SA, \u00a7\u00a7IX\u2013X) could also solve the problem. We note\nthat if second-order logic can be made palatable to the\nnominalist\u2014perhaps by adopting a plural interpretation of\nsecond-order logic \n (Boolos 1984, 1985), or a proof-theoretic semantics, \nor in any other way\u2014Frege\u2019s original definition (which is not\nformulated in set theory, but in his version of second-order logic)\ncan be employed (Rossberg and Cohnitz 2009).\nEven though these two particularly pressing gaps appear to be\ncapable of being closed, a general recipe for recasting platonist\nstatements appears out of reach, in particular, when we consider\nstatements of pure mathematics itself. Without such a nominalist\nrecasting, Goodman and Quine hold, platonist mathematical\nstatements cannot be deemed intelligible from a strictly nominalist\nperspective. The question becomes, according to Goodman and Quine,\n\n\nhow, if we regard the sentences of mathematics merely as strings of\nmarks without meaning, we can account for the fact that mathematicians\ncan proceed with such remarkable agreement as to methods and\nresults. Our answer is that such intelligibility as mathematics\npossesses derives from the syntactical or metamathematical rules\ngoverning those marks. (Goodman and Quine 1947, 111)\n\n\n\n\nGoodman and Quine construct a theory of syntax for the\nset-theoretic language and a proof theory based on the Calculus of\n Individuals (see\n section 3.2 below) \n supplemented with a token-concatenation theory. The tokens in question\nare concrete, particular inscriptions of the logical symbols,\nvariable-letters, parentheses, and the \u201c\\(\\in\\)\u201d (for\nset-membership) that are use to formulate the language of set\ntheory. Primitive predicates are introduced to categorize the\ndifferent primitive symbols: all concrete, particular\n\u201c\\(\\in\\)\u201d-inscriptions, for instance, fall under the\npredicate \u201cEp\u201d. Concrete complex formulae, e.g., \n\u201c\\(x \\in y\\)\u201d, are concatenations of concrete primitive\nsymbols\u2014in our case the concatenation of\n\u201c\\(x\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\in\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(y\\)\u201d. Bit by bit, Goodman and Quine define their\nway up to which concrete inscriptions count as correctly formed\nsentences of the language of set theory, and finally which concrete\ninscriptions count as proofs and theorems. Goodman and Quine argue\nthat in this way the nominalist can explain the \u201cremarkable\nagreement\u201d of mathematicians mentioned above.\nSince Quine and Goodman not only impose nominalistic strictures,\nbut also finitism in their joint article (Quine and Goodman 1947,\n\u00a72), the syntactic and proof-theoretic notions defined still fall\nshort of the usual platonist counterparts. Even if any given sentence\nor proof is finite in length, the platonist would hold that there are\nsentences and proofs of any finite length, and thus sentences and\nproofs that are too long to have a concrete inscription in a given\nfinite universe.  Moreover, there are infinitely many (and indeed\nuncountably many) truths of mathematics, but\u2014in particular, in a\nfinite universe\u2014there will only ever be finitely many\ninscriptions of theorems. Even if the universe is in fact infinite,\nperhaps a theory of syntax and proof should not make itself hostage to\nthis circumstance.\nPlatonists and nominalists will likely disagree whether Goodman and\nQuine successfully argue their case in their joint paper. Goodman and\nQuine will be able to account for any actual mathematical proof and\nany theorem actually proven, since there are at any stage only\nfinitely many of them, each of which is small enough to fit in our\nuniverse comfortably. Thus, arguably, they reach their goal of\nexplaining the agreement in mathematical practice without presupposing\nmathematical platonism. Due to its finitistic nature, however, the\naccount radically falls short of giving explications that are\nextensionally equivalent to the platonists\u2019 conceptions (see Rossberg\nand Cohnitz 2009 for discussion and a landscape of possible\nsolutions). Goodman later (1956) explains that nominalism is not\nincompatible with the rejection of finitism; it is\n at most incongruous [\u2026]. The nominalist is\nunlikely to be a non-finitist only in much the way a bricklayer is\nunlikely to be a ballet dancer. (PP, 166; on the question of finitism\nsee also MM, 53; Field 1980; Hellman 2001; Mancosu\n2005)\nGiven the ardent pronouncements in the 1947 article with Quine, the\ncommon misunderstanding that Goodman\u2019s mature nominalism encompasses,\nor is motivated by, the rejection of abstract objects is\nunderstandable. Nonetheless, it is incorrect. Goodman does not reject\nall abstract objects: in The Structure of Appearance, he\nembraces qualia as abstract objects (see\n section 4 below), \nsome of which (in fact all but moments) are universals (SA,\n\u00a7VII.8). Goodman\u2019s mature nominalism, from The Structure of\nAppearance onwards, is a rejection of the use of sets\n(and objects constructed from them) in constructional systems, and no\nblanket rejection of all universals or abstract particulars. To be\nsure, Goodman also refuses to acknowledge properties and other\nnon-extensional objects, but the reason for his rejection of such entities is\nindependent, and in fact more fundamental, than his nominalism: it is\nhis strict requirement of extensionality (WW, 95n3; see also\n section 6 below). \nGoodman does occasionally include extensionalism in his nominalism\n(see LA, xiii, 74; under the entry \u201cnominalism\u201d the index\nof LA references some passage which discusses properties ; see also\nMM, 51; WW, 10n14). Strictly speaking, however, nominalism for Goodman\nis the refusal to use class terms in a constructional system\u2014no\nmore, and no less.\nGoodman presents two positive considerations for the rejection of a\nset-theoretic language (not counting the remarks in Goodman and Quine\n1947, 105). Methodologically, nominalistic constructions have the\nadvantage that they do not use any resources that the platonist could\nnot accept (Goodman 1958; PP, 171). The advantage of a nominalistic\nconstruction is thus one of parsimony:\n\nAs originally presented in A Study of Qualities [\u2026]\nthe system was not nominalistic. I feel that the recasting to meet\nnominalistic demands has resulted not only in a sparser ontology but\nalso in a considerable gain in simplicity and clarity. Moreover,\nanyone who dislikes the change may be assured that the process of\nreplatonizing the system\u2014unlike the converse process\u2014is\nobvious and automatic; and this in itself is an advantage of a\nnominalistic formulation. (SA, Original Introduction, page L of the\n3rd. ed.; regarding the simplicity remark see SA, \u00a7III.7)\n\nAll resources employed by the nominalist are (or should be)\nacceptable to the platonist, while the converse may not be the case\n(see also Goodman 1956, 31 (PP, 171); MM, 50).\nBy the time he writes The Structure of Appearance, Goodman\nhas come around to a different criterion for whether or not a system\nobeys nominalistic structures: the predicates present in the whole\nsystem (SA, \u00a7II.3). This is as opposed to merely considering the\nbasis of the system in answer to this question as he does in A\nStudy of Qualities (as mentioned above). In Goodman 1958 (see\nalso SA, \u00a7III.7), he suggests a different, perhaps more precise,\nway to characterize nominalistic systems in terms of the\nsystem\u2019s generating relation:\n\nSystem S is nominalistic iff S does not\ngenerate more than one entity from exactly the same atoms\nof S.\n\nGoodman describes the criterion as demanding that \u201csameness\nof content\u201d entails identity. Systems that have only\nmereological means of \u201cgenerating\u201d composite objects (see\nsection\n 3.2 Mereology below) \ncount as nominalistic according to this criterion. Parthood is\ntransitive, so from atoms a and b only one further\nobject can be \u201cgenerated\u201d, the mereological sum\nof a and b. A set-forming operation, however, will\ndistinguish, for instance, between {a, b} (the set\nof a and b) and {{a, b}} (the set\ncontaining the set of a and b) and {{a},\n{b}} (the set containing the singleton set of a and\nthe singleton set of b). None of the these three are pairwise\nidentical. Membership is not transitive. The first and third contain\ntwo members, but not the same members (both a and b\nare members of the first set, but not of the third), while the second\nset has only one member (namely the first set). All three (and\ninfinitely many others) are generated from the same atoms, however, or\nas Goodman might put it, they have the same content: a\nand b. A system featuring a set-theoretic generating relation\nthus does not count as nominalistic.\nThe sameness-of-content criterion was criticized by David Lewis\n(1991, 40) as question-begging. Lewis suggests that the only\nalternatives for generating relations that Goodman allows are\nmereological, set-theoretical, or a combination of the two, and that\nonly mereological generation passes the test. Unless one rejects set\ntheory already, Lewis contends, one would not find the criterion\nplausible. There are, however, non-extensional mereological systems\nthat violate the sameness-of-content criterion as well (see entry\non mereology). Moreover, the\nsameness-of-content criterion may be understood as a version of \nOckham\u2019s Razor, demanding not to multiply entities beyond necessity.\n3.2 Mereology\nThe Polish logician Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski (1886\u20131939) must\nsurely count as the father of mereology\u2014the theory of parts and\nwholes\u2014but around 1930, Goodman re-invents the theory together\nwith his fellow graduate student Henry S. Leonard\n(1905\u20131967). Only in 1935 do Goodman and Leonard learn of\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s work through one of their fellow students, W.V.  Quine\n(Quine 1985, 122). An early version of Leonard and Goodman\u2019s system is\ncontained in Leonard\u2019s Ph.D. thesis, Singular Terms (Leonard\n1930). In 1936, Leonard and Goodman present their mature system at a\nmeeting of the Association of Symbolic Logic; the corresponding paper\nis published four years later under the title \u201cThe Calculus of\nIndividuals and Its Uses\u201d (Leonard and Goodman\n1940). Subsequently, Goodman uses the calculus in his own\nPh.D. thesis, A Study of Qualities (SQ), and a version of it\nin The Structure of Appearance (SA). Little is known about\nthe nature of Goodman and Leonard\u2019s cooperation on the calculus.\nGoodman attributes the first thought for the collaborative project to\nLeonard (PP, 149). Leonard, more concretely, suggests in a (still)\nunpublished note:\n\nIf responsibilities can be divided in a collaborative enterprise, I\nbelieve that it may be fairly stated that the major responsibility for\nthe formal calculus [\u2026] was mine, while the major\nresponsibility for discussions of applications [\u2026] lay with\nGoodman. (Leonard 1967)\n\nQuine only mentions that he himself \u201cwas able to help them on\na technical problem\u201d (Quine 1985, 122). Leonard\u2019s system\nof Singular Terms is significantly different from, and indeed\nin philosophically interesting ways weaker than, the Calculus of\nIndividuals (Rossberg 2009), but the exact extent of Goodman\u2019s\ntechnical contribution to the calculus remains unknown.\nPerhaps surprisingly, nominalistic scruples were not the driving\nforce behind the development the Calculus of Individuals. Instead, their goal is to\nsolve a technical problem in Carnap\u2019s Aufbau (1928) (see\n section 4 below), \nand to this end they employ both set-theoretic and mereological\nnotions. Leonard, in his Ph.D.  thesis (supervised by Alfred North\nWhitehead), presents his calculus as \u201can interpolation in\nWhitehead and Russell\u2019s Principia Mathematica between *14 and\n*20\u201d (Leonard 1967), and makes liberal use of class-terms in the\nformulation (Leonard 1930). Also the joint\npaper of Leonard and Goodman is formulated using class terms, as is\nthe system Goodman used in his own Ph.D. thesis, A Study of\nQualities (1941, SQ). It is not until his joint article with\nQuine (Goodman and Quine 1947) and his Structure of\nAppearance (1951, SA) that Goodman eschews the use of set theory\nto formulate the Calculus of Individuals.\nAs mentioned above, parthood, as opposed to the set-theoretic\nnotion of membership, is transitive: if a is a part\nof b and b is a part of c, then a\nis a part of c. Neither the system Leonard and Goodman\npresent in their 1940 article, nor the version in Goodman\u2019s A\nStudy of Qualities, nor the calculus he uses in The Structure\nof Appearance, take \u201cpart\u201d as primitive. Rather, it\nis in all three cases defined based on the sole primitive notion\nadopted: overlap in SA, and discreteness in the\nother two systems. Overlap can pre-systematically be understood as\nsharing a part in common; discreteness as sharing no part in\ncommon. All three systems indeed define parthood so that these two\npre-systematic understandings come out as theorems.\nThe Calculus of Individuals in all its formulations contains\nprinciples of mereological summation and mereological fusion.\nMereological summation is a binary function of individuals, so that\nthe sum s of two individuals a and b is\nsuch that both a and b, and all their parts, are\nparts of s\u2014and also all sums of parts of a\nand b and are parts of s. Mereological fusion is a\ngeneralization of the mereological summation. In Leonard and Goodman\n1940 fusion is defined using sets: all the members of a set \u03b1\nare \u201cfused\u201d in the sense that they, and all their parts,\nand all the fusions amongst their parts, end up being parts of the\nindividual that is the fusion of set \u03b1.\nThe technical details of the different versions of the Calculus of\nIndividuals can be found in this supplementary document:\nThe Calculus of Individuals in its different versions\n (see also entry on \n mereology).\nUnrestricted mereological fusion has been widely criticized as too\npermissive. \nIt allows for so-called scattered objects (e.g., the sum of the Eiffel\nTower and the Moon) and in the case of Goodman\u2019s construction\nin The Structure of Appearance for sums of radically\ndifferent kinds of objects, like sounds and colors. W.V. Quine, after\nendorsing this principle in a joint paper with Goodman (Goodman and\nQuine 1947), becomes one of its first critics in his review of The\nStructure of Appearance:\n\npart, clear initially as a spatio-temporal concept, is here\nunderstood only by spatio-temporal analogy. [\u2026] When finally we\nproceed to sums of heterogeneous qualia, say a color and two sounds\nand a position and a moment, the analogy tries the imagination. (Quine\n1951b, 559)\n\nGoodman (1956) maintains that the criticism is disingenuous if put\nforward by a platonist: set-theoretic \u201ccomposition\u201d is as\nleast as permissive as mereological fusion. Whenever there is a fusion\nof scattered concrete objects, there is also a set of them (see Simons\n1987 or van Inwagen 1990 for prominent criticisms of unrestricted\ncomposition).\n4. The Structure of Appearance\nThe Structure of Appearance is perhaps Goodman\u2019s main\nwork, although it is less widely known than, for\nexample, Languages of Art. It is, in fact, a heavily revised\nversion of Goodman\u2019s Ph.D. thesis, A Study of Qualities. SA\nis a constitutional system, which, just like Rudolf Carnap\u2019s Der\nlogische Aufbau der Welt, shows how from a basis of primitive\nobjects and a basic relation between those objects all other objects\ncan be obtained by definitions alone. We commented above already on\nthe anti-foundationalist nature of both Carnap\u2019s and Goodman\u2019s\nconstitutional systems. For them, the point of carrying out such a\nconstruction was not to provide a foundationalist reduction to some\nprivileged basis (of experience or ontology), but rather to study the\nnature and logic of constitutional systems as such. In this sense,\nGoodman\u2019s interest in other \u201cworld versions\u201d, such as the\nlanguages of art, should be seen as a continuation of his project in\nSA.\n4.1 Goodman on Analysis\nBecause Goodman is interested in the nature and logic of\nconstitutional systems as such, he begins his discussion in The\nStructure of Appearance with meta-theoretical considerations.\nSince the project of SA is to develop a constitutional system that\ndefines other notions from a predetermined basis, the question is\nwhich conditions of adequacy should be in place for evaluating the\ndefinitions. Constitutional systems are systems of rational\nreconstruction, i.e., the concepts, objects, or truths that get\nconstituted by definition from the basis are supposedly counterparts\nof concepts, objects or truths that we accept already\npre-theoretically.\nOne might think that such a reconstruction is only successful\nif definiens and definienda are synonymous. However,\nGoodman argues that the definiens of an accurate definition\nneed have neither the same intension nor even the same extension as\nthe definiendum; thus, taking as an example Alfred North\nWhitehead\u2019s analysis of geometrical points, points in space may be\ndefined equally well as certain classes of straight lines or as\ncertain infinite convergent sets of concentric spheres; but these\nalternative definientia are neither cointensive (synonymous)\nnor coextensive with each other. A set of sets of straight lines is\njust not the same set of objects as a set of infinite convergent sets\nof concentric spheres. Hence, their accuracy notwithstanding, the\nrespective definitions are not coextensive with, let alone synonymous\nwith, the definiendum. Accuracy of constructional definitions\namounts to no more than a certain homomorphism of\nthe definiens with the definiendum. This means that\nthe concepts of the constructional system must provide a structural\nmodel for the explicanda in the sense that for every connection\nbetween entities that is describable in terms of the explicanda, there\nmust obtain a matching connection, stateable in terms of the\nrespective explicata or definientia, among the counterparts\nthat the entities in question have within the system. In this way the\ntwo different definitions of \u201cpoint\u201d serve their purpose\nequally well. The objects in the sets generated\u2014although being\nvery different in kind\u2014stand in just the right relations to one\nanother within the sets to serve as an explicatum for\n\u201cpoint\u201d as geometry demands. This rather pragmatic\ncriterion of adequacy for philosophical analyses serves Goodman well\nfor a number of reasons. The most important is perhaps that Goodman\ndoes not believe there was any such thing as identity in meaning of\ntwo different expressions (see our discussion of likeness of meaning\nabove). Thus, if synonymy was made the criterion of adequacy, no\nanalysis could ever satisfy it. But relaxing the criteria of adequacy\nfor philosophical analyses to structure-preservation also supports\nGoodman\u2019s more radical theses in epistemology and metaphysics,\nespecially in his later philosophy. One of his reasons to replace the\nnotion of truth with that of \u201crightness of symbolic\nfunction\u201d, the notion of certainty with that of\n\u201cadoption\u201d, and the notion of knowledge with that of\nunderstanding is the thought that the new system of concepts preserves\nthe structural relations of the old without preserving the\nphilosophical puzzles related to truth, certainty and knowledge (RP,\nchapter X).\n4.2 The Critique of Carnap\u2019s Aufbau\nGoodman\u2019s predecessor in studying a constitutional system by the\nmeans of modern formal logic is, as we already said, Rudolf Carnap,\nwho follows a very similar project as Goodman in his Der logische\nAufbau der Welt (Carnap 1928). In this book Carnap investigates\nthe example of a world built up from primitive temporal parts of the\ntotality of experiences of a subject (the so-called \u201celementary\nexperiences\u201d or just \u201cerlebs\u201d) and thus faces the\nproblem of abstraction: how can qualities, properties and their\nobjects in the world be abstracted from our phenomenal\nexperiences.\nCarnap tries to show that by using the method of\n\u201cquasi-analysis\u201d all the structure can be retained from\nthe basis if the \u201cerlebs\u201d are ordered by a simple relation\nof part-similarity. Very roughly, the idea is that, although the\nindividual temporal slices of our totality of experience are not\nstructured (and thus have no parts), we can, via quasi-analysis, get\nto their quasi-parts, the \u201cqualities\u201d they share with\nother time-slices with which they are part-similar. Of course, time\nslices of the totality of our experiences can be part-similar with\neach other in a variety of ways. Perhaps two slices are similar with\nrespect to what is in our visual field at the time in question, or\nthey are similar with respect to what we hear or smell. However, since\nthe time-slices are primitives in the system, we cannot yet even talk\nabout these respects or ways in which the slices should be similar in\norder to, for example, be considered experiences of the same\ncolor. Carnap\u2019s ingenious idea is to group exactly those erlebs\ntogether that are mutually part-similar, thereby grouping exactly\nthose that share (pre-theoretically speaking) a property. For simple\ncases the quasi-analysis seems to give exactly the right\nresults. Consider the following group of erlebs that,\npre-theoretically have different colors.\n\n\nFigure 1a.\n\nHowever, we do not yet know that there are such things as\ncolors. In fact the only thing we know about the erlebs\n(A\u2013F) is that they are part similar as displayed\nin the following graph (where part-similarity between erlebs is\nindicated by a line):\n\n\nFigure 1b.\n\n\n\nIf we take the graph and now group exactly those erlebs together\nthat are mutually part-similar, we get the following sets:\n\n\\[\n\\{A, B, C, F\\}, \\{A, E, F\\}, \\{C, D, F\\}\n\\]\n\nBut, of course, these sets correspond exactly to the extensions of\nthe colors in our example (viz. black, green, and red). Thus, by\nknowing about the part-similarity between erlebs alone, we seem to be\nable to reconstruct their properties with the method of\nquasi-analysis.\nGoodman observes, however, that in unfavorable circumstances\nquasi-analysis will lead to the wrong results. Consider the following\nsituation:\n\n\nFigure 2a.\n\nThis corresponds to the following graph:\n\n\nFigure 2b.\n\nIf we use Carnap\u2019s rule for quasi-analysis, we will obtain all\ncolor classes except \\(\\{A, E, F\\}\\), the color class for\n\u201cgreen\u201d, because green only occurs in \u201cconstant\ncompanionship\u201d with the color \u201cblack\u201d. Goodman calls\nthis the \u201cconstant companionship difficulty\u201d.\nA second problem can be illustrated with the following example of\nerlebs:\n\n\nFigure 3a.\n\nThis corresponds to this graph:\n\n\nFigure 3b.\n\nBut here \\(\\{A,C,F\\}\\) should be a color class resulting from\nquasi-analysis, although \\(A\\), \\(C\\), and \\(F\\) have in fact\nno color in common.  Goodman calls this problem \u201cthe difficulty\nof imperfect community\u201d. It is controversial to what extent\nthese problems are devastating for Carnap\u2019s project, but Goodman\nconsidered them to be serious.\n4.3 Goodman\u2019s Own Construction\nIn contrast to Carnap, Goodman begins from a realist basis,\nconsidering the example of a system built on phenomenal qualities,\nso-called qualia (phenomenal colors, phenomenal sounds, etc.) and thus\nfaced the problem of concretion: how can concrete experiences\nbe built up from abstract particulars?\nIn the visual realm, a concretum is a color-spot moment,\nwhich may be construed as the sum of a color, a visual-field place and\na time, all of which stand in a peculiar relation of togetherness.\nGoodman adopts this relation as a primitive and then shows how, by\nmeans of it, it is possible to define the concept of the concrete\nindividual as well as the various relations of qualification in which\nqualia and certain sums of qualia stand to the fully or partially\nconcrete individuals that exhibit them.\nAfter this is done, Goodman faces his second major constructional\nobjective. He has to order the qualia into different categories. The\nproblem is to construct for each of the categories (color, time,\nplace, and so forth) a map that assigns a unique position to each\nquale in the category, and that represents the relative likeness of\nqualia by nearness in position. The solution to the problem requires\nin each case the specification of a set of terms by means of which the\norder at hand can be described, and then the selection of primitives\nsuitable to define them. Goodman thereby shows how predicates\nreferring to size and shape of phenomenal concreta may be introduced,\nand he suggests briefly some approaches to the definition of the\ndifferent categories of qualia by reference to their structural\ncharacteristics.\nGoodman shows in SA how using a mereological system can help to\navoid the difficulty of imperfect community for a system built on a\nrealist base (such as SA), as well as for a system built on a\nparticularistic base (such as Der logische Aufbau der Welt).\nThe constant companionship difficulty, on the other hand, does not\narise in SA because no two concreta can have all their qualities in\ncommon.\n4.4 The Significance of The Structure of Appearance\nVery many of the side issues dealt with in A Study of\nQualities and The Structure of Appearance reappear in\nGoodman\u2019s later philosophy. The \u201cgrue\u201d-problem (to be\nexplained in the next section) as a problem of what predicates to use\nfor projection and the related problem of how to analyze disposition\npredicates, as well as the question of how to explicate simplicity,\ntense, aboutness, and so on, all have their roots in Goodman\u2019s\ndissertation. Alas, his most important work is also his most\ncomplicated, which is perhaps the reason why it is so often ignored.\nOther writings by Goodman are seemingly more accessible and have thus\nattracted a wider readership. However, it is arguable that the\nsignificance of Goodman\u2019s \u201ceasier\u201d pieces cannot be\nassessed adequately without relating them to the problems and projects\nof A Study of Qualities and The Structure of\nAppearance.\n5. The Old and the New Riddle of Induction and their Solution\n5.1 The Old Problem of Induction is a Pseudo-problem\nThe old problem of induction is the problem of justifying inductive\ninferences. What is traditionally required from such a justification\nis an argument that establishes that using inductive inferences does\nnot lead us astray. Although it seems to be a meaningful question\nwhether there is such a justification for our inductive practices,\nDavid Hume argues that there can be no such justification (Hume\n[1739\u201340] 2000; see the discussion of Hume in the entry on\n the problem of induction).\nIt is important to understand that Hume\u2019s argument is\ngeneral. It is not just an argument against a particular\nattempt to justify induction in the sense above, but a general argument\nthat there can be no such justification at all.\nIn order to see the generality of this argument, we have to note\nthat the same problem also arises for deduction (FFF,\n\u00a7III.2). That deduction is in the same predicament is observed by\nGoodman and exploited for his solution of Hume\u2019s problem of induction.\nThus the upshot of Goodman\u2019s understanding of Hume\u2019s argument is that\nthere can be no justification of our inferential practices, if such a\njustification requires a reason for their justifiedness. Accordingly,\nthe old problem of induction, which requires such a justification of\ninduction, is a pseudo-problem.\n5.2 Hume\u2019s Problem, Logic, and Reflective Equilibrium\nIf the problem of induction is not how to justify induction in the\nsense mentioned above, then what is it? It is helpful here to look at\nthe case of deduction. Instances of deductive inferences are justified\nby showing that they are inferences in accordance with valid rules of\ninference. According to Goodman, the rules of logic are in turn valid\nbecause they are more or less in accordance with what we intuitively\naccept as instances of a valid deductive inference (FFF, 64).\nOn the one hand, we have certain intuitions about which deductive\ninferences are valid; on the other hand we have rules of inference.\nConfronted with an intuitively valid inference, we check whether it\naccords to the rules we already accept. If it does not, we might\nreject the inference as invalid. If, however, our intuition that the\npurported inference is valid is stronger than our confidence that our\nlogical rules are adequate, we might consider amending the rules. This\nsoon leads to a complicated process. We have to take into account that\nthe rules must remain coherent and not too complicated to apply. In\nlogic, we want the rules to be, for example, topic neutral, i.e.,\napplicable to inferences (as far as possible) independent of specific\nsubject matter. On the other hand, we also want to extract as much\ninformation from premises as possible, so we do not want to risk being\ntoo cautious in accepting rules. In this process we make adjustments\non both sides, slowly bringing our judgments concerning validity into\na reflective equilibrium with the rules for valid inferences\nuntil we finally get a stable system of accepted rules. (The term\n \u201creflective equilibrium\u201d\nwas introduced by John Rawls (1971) for Goodman\u2019s technique.)\nReflective equilibrium is a story about how we actually\njustify our inferential practices. According to Goodman, nothing more\ncan be demanded or achieved. It seems, perhaps, prima facie\ndesirable that we also seek a justification in the sense of the old\nproblem, but Hume\u2019s argument suggests that such a justification is\nimpossible. If this is correct, the remaining problem is to define our\ninferential practices by bringing explicit rules into reflective\nequilibrium with our tutored intuitions. \u201cJustified\u201d or\n\u201cvalid\u201d are predicates that are applied to inferences on\nthis basis.\nIt thus also becomes clearer how Goodman thought about Hume\u2019s\nsolution\u2014that induction is merely a matter of custom or habit.\nHume\u2019s solution might be incomplete, but it is basically correct.  The\nremaining task is then to explicate the pre-theoretic notion of valid\ninductive inference by defining rules of inference that can be brought\ninto a reflective equilibrium with intuitive judgments of inductive\nvalidity.\n5.3 The New Riddle of Induction\nBefore presenting Goodman\u2019s solution, we first have to discuss\nGoodman\u2019s own challenge, the so-called \u201cNew Riddle of\nInduction\u201d.\nConsider the following two (supposedly true) statements:\n\n(B1)\n This piece of copper conducts electricity.\n\n(B2)\n This man in the room is a third son.\n\n\nB1 is a confirmation instance of the following regularity\nstatement:\n\n(L1)\nAll pieces of copper conduct electricity.\n\n\nBut does B2 confirm anything like L2?\n\n(L2)\nAll men in this room are third sons.\n\n\nObviously, it does not. But what makes the difference? Both\nregularity statements (L1 and L2) are built according to the exact\nsame syntactical procedure from the evidence statements. Therefore, it\ndoes not seem to be for a syntactical reason that B1 confirms L1 but\nB2 fails to confirm L2. Rather, the reason is that statements like L1\nare lawlike, whereas statements like L2 at best express accidentally\ntrue generalizations. Lawlike statements, in contrast to accidentally\ntrue general statements, are confirmed by their instances and support\ncounterfactuals. L1 supports the counterfactual claim that if this\nthing I have in my hand were a piece of copper, it would conduct\nelectricity. In contrast, supposing that it is indeed true, L2 would\nnot support that if an arbitrary man were here in the room, he would\nbe a third son. To tell which statements are lawlike and which\nstatements are not is therefore of great importance in the philosophy\nof science.  A satisfactory account of induction (or corroboration -- \n see the discussion of Popper in the entry on \n the problem of induction) \nas well as explanation and prediction requires this distinction.  \nGoodman, however, shows that this is extremely hard to get.\nHere comes the riddle. Suppose that your research is in gemology.\nYour special interest lies in the color properties of certain\ngemstones, in particular, emeralds. All emeralds you have examined\nbefore a certain time \\(t\\) were green (your notebook is full of\nevidence statements of the form \u201cEmerald \\(x\\) found at\nplace \\(y\\) date \\(z (z \\le t)\\) is green\u201d). It seems that,\nat \\(t\\), this supports the hypothesis that all emeralds are\ngreen (L3).\nNow Goodman introduces the predicate \u201cgrue\u201d. This\npredicate applies to all things examined before some future\ntime \\(t\\) just in case they are green but to other things\n(observed at or after \\(t\\)) just in case they are blue:\n\n(DEF1)  \\(x\\) is\ngrue \\(=_{df}\\) \\(x\\) is examined before \\(t\\) and green \u2228\n\\(x\\) is not so examined and blue \n\nUntil \\(t\\) it is obviously the case that for each statement\nin your notebook, there is a parallel statement asserting that the\nemerald \\(x\\) found at place \\(y\\) date \\(z (z \\le t)\\) is\ngrue. Each of these statements is analytically equivalent with the\ncorresponding one in your notebook. All these grue-evidence statements\ntaken together confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are grue (L4),\nand they confirm this hypothesis to the exact same degree as the\ngreen-evidence statements confirmed the hypothesis that all emeralds\nare green. But if that is the case, then the following two predictions\nare also confirmed to the same degree:\n\n(P1)\nThe next emerald first examined after \\(t\\) will be green.\n\n(P2)\nThe next emerald first examined after \\(t\\) will be grue.\n\n\nHowever, to be a grue emerald examined after \\(t\\) is not to\nbe a green emerald. An emerald first examined after \\(t\\) is grue\niff it is blue. We have two mutually incompatible predictions, both\nconfirmed to the same degree by the past evidence. We could obviously\ndefine infinitely many grue-like predicates that would all lead to\nnew, similarly incompatible predictions.\nThe immediate lesson is that we cannot use all kinds of weird\npredicates to formulate hypotheses or to classify our evidence. Some\npredicates (which are the ones like \u201cgreen\u201d) can be used\nfor this; other predicates (the ones like \u201cgrue\u201d) must be\nexcluded, if induction is supposed to make any sense. This already is\nan interesting result. For valid inductive inferences the choice of\npredicates matters. \nIt is not just that we lack justification for accepting a general\nhypothesis as true only on the basis of positive instances and lack of\ncounterinstances (which was the old problem), or to define what rule\nwe are using when accepting a general hypothesis as true on these\ngrounds (which was the problem after Hume). The problem is to explain\nwhy some general statements (such as L3) are confirmed by their\ninstances, whereas others (such as L4) are not. Again, this is a\nmatter of the lawlikeness of L3 in contrast to L4, but how are we\nsupposed to tell the lawlike regularities from the illegitimate\ngeneralizations?\nAn immediate reply is that the illegitimate generalization L4\ninvolves a temporal restriction, just as L2 was restricted spatially\n(see e.g., Carnap 1947). The idea would be that predicates that cannot\nbe used for induction are analytically \u201cpositional\u201d, i.e.,\ntheir definitions refer to individual constants (for places or times).\nA projectible predicate, i.e., a predicate that can be used for\ninduction, has no definition which would refer to such individual\nconstants but is purely qualitative (e.g., because it is a basic\npredicate). The trouble is that this reply makes it relative to a\nlanguage whether or not a predicate is projectible. If we begin with a\nlanguage containing the basic predicates \u201cgreen\u201d and\n\u201cblue\u201d (as in English), \u201cgrue\u201d and\n\u201cbleen\u201d are positional. \u201cBleen\u201d is defined as\nfollows:\n\n(DEF2)\n \\(x\\) is bleen \\(=_{df}\\) \\(x\\) is\n    examined before \\(t\\) and blue \u2228 \\(x\\) is not so\n    examined and green\n\n\nBut if we start with a language that has \u201cbleen\u201d and\n\u201cgrue\u201d as basic predicates, \u201cgreen\u201d and\n\u201cblue\u201d are positional:\n\n(DEF3)\n\\(x\\) is green \\(=_{df}\\) \\(x\\) is\n    examined before \\(t\\) and grue \u2228 \\(x\\) is not so\n    examined and bleen\n\n(DEF4)\n\\(x\\) is blue \\(=_{df}\\) \\(x\\) is\n    examined before \\(t\\) and bleen \u2228 \\(x\\) is not so\n    examined and grue\n\n\n\n\nBoth languages are symmetrical in all their semantic and\nsyntactical properties. So the positionality of predicates is not\ninvariant with respect to linguistically equivalent\ntransformations. But if this is the case, there is no semantic or\nsyntactic criterion on whose basis we could draw the line between\nprojectible predicates and predicates that we cannot use for\ninduction.\n5.4 Goodman\u2019s Solution\nGoodman\u2019s solution to the new riddle of induction resembles Hume\u2019s\nsolution in an important way. Instead of providing a theory that would\nultimately justify our choice of predicates for induction, he develops\na theory that provides an account of how we in fact choose predicates\nfor induction and projection. Goodman observes that predicates like\n\u201cgreen\u201d are favored over predicates like\n\u201cgrue\u201d, because the former are much\nbetter entrenched, i.e., in the past we projected many more\nhypotheses featuring \u201cgreen\u201d or predicates co-extensional\nwith \u201cgreen\u201d than hypothesis featuring the predicate\n\u201cgrue\u201d. If two hypotheses are the same with respect to\ntheir empirical track-record, then the hypothesis that uses the better\nentrenched predicates overrides the alternatives. On the basis of\nthese considerations, Goodman defines projectibility (and\ncognates) for hypotheses (FFF, 108):\n\nA hypothesis is projectible iff it is supported,\nunviolated, and unexhausted, and all hypotheses conflicting with it\nare overridden.\nA hypothesis is unprojectible iff it is unsupported, exhausted,\nviolated, or overridden.\nA hypothesis is nonprojectible iff it and a conflicting hypothesis\nare supported, unviolated, unexhausted, and not overridden.\n\nThe last definition takes care of situations when we are confronted\nwith two hypotheses that are in conflict and neither has a better\nentrenched predicate. Entrenchment can even be further refined to\naccount for cases in which a predicate inherits the entrenchment from\nanother of which it is derivative. (The critical literature on Goodman\u2019s\nNew Riddle is too extensive to do it justice here; see Stalker 1994  \nand Elgin 1997c for selections of important essays on the topic. \nStalker 1994 also contains an annotated bibliography, comprising \nover 300 entries. The discussion of course continued after the 1990s and the\nliterature is still growing.)\n\n\nGoodman\u2019s solution makes projectibility essentially a matter of\nwhat language we use and have used to describe and predict\nthe behaviour of our world. However, this language-, or better\nversion-relativism is just another aspect of Goodman\u2019s\nirrealism.\n6. Irrealism and Worldmaking\n6.1 Irrealism\nGoodman labels his own position \u201cirrealism\u201d. Irrealism,\nroughly, is the claim that the world dissolves into versions.\nGoodman\u2019s irrealism is certainly the most controversial aspect of his\nphilosophy.\nTwo lines of argument can be separated in Goodman\u2019s writings (Dudau\n2002). First, Goodman argues that there are conflicting statements\nthat cannot be accommodated in a single world version: some truths\nconflict (WW, 109\u201316; MM, 30\u201344). If that is the case, we\nneed many worlds, if any, to accommodate the conflicting versions and\nbring them in unison with the standard correspondence account of\ntruth, that is, that the truth of a statement is its being in\ncorrespondence with a world. The second line of argument seems to be\nthat we need no worlds at all if we need many. If we need a world for\neach version, why postulate the worlds over and above the\nversions?\nLet us first have a closer look at the first line of reasoning. The\nEarth stands still, revolves around the Sun, and runs many other\ncourses as well at the same time. Yet nothing moves while at rest. As\nGoodman concedes, the natural response to this is that the\nsentences\n\n(S1)\nThe Earth is at rest.\n\n(S2)\n The Earth moves.\n\n\nshould be understood as elliptical for\n\n(S1\u2032)\nThe Earth is at rest according to the geocentric system.\n\n(S2\u2032)\nThe Earth moves according to the heliocentric system.\n\n\nHowever, according to Goodman, this would be wrong-headed (WW,\n112).  Consider the following two historiographical sentences:\n\u201cThe kings of Sparta had two votes\u201d and \u201cThe kings\nof Sparta had only one vote\u201d. The first sentence is part of a\nreport by Herodotus, the second part of a report by Thucydides. There\nis, again, an inclination to understand these sentences as ellipses\nfor \u201cAccording to Herodotus, the kings of Sparta had two\nvotes\u201d, and \u201cAccording to Thucydides, the kings of Sparta\nhad only one vote\u201d. But obviously these latter two sentences do\nnot tell us anything about Sparta. They only tell us about what\nHerodotus and Thucydides said about Sparta. It is true that\n\u201caccording to Herodotus, the kings of Sparta had two\nvotes\u201d, even if they actually had no vote or had three\nvotes. The same holds for the relativizations to the geocentric and\nthe heliocentric systems: it is true that the Earth is at rest\naccording to the geocentric system, but that still does not inform us\nabout the world. Thus, if we assume that (S1) and (S2) are both true,\nwe end up with a contradiction if we take them to be literally true of\none and the same world. If we do not take them to be literally true,\nbut to be elliptical and implicitly relativized, we end up with two\ntruths that are not about any world. At least, they are not about the\nparts of the world we were interested in. They turn out to be truths\nabout versions, but not truths about planets. The solution chosen by\nGoodman is to claim that they are about two different worlds. Both\nstate a literal truth about a world, but just not about the same\nworld.\nIt is crucial for Goodman\u2019s argument that in the conflict between\n(S1) and (S2) we have (a) an actual conflict between statements, and\n(b) no other way to resolve that conflict (like, for example,\nrejecting at least one of the two statements in a non-arbitrary\nway). Of course, other contemporaries of Goodman, such as Quine and\nCarnap, also consider the problem that experience alone might\nunderdetermine theory-choice, but believed that pragmatic criteria\nwill in the long run allow us to arrive at one all-encompassing\ncoherent version of the world. In Quine\u2019s (Quine 1981) and Carnap\u2019s\n(Carnap 1932) philosophies, this is assumed to be a physical version.\nBut Goodman does not believe in physicalist reductivism. First of all,\nthere does not currently seem to be any convincing evidence that all\ntruths are reducible to physics (just consider the problem of reducing\nmental truths to physical truths), and, secondly, physics itself does\nnot even appear to form a coherent system (WW, 5). Hence, for Goodman,\nwe are stuck with conflicting world versions we consider true. Since,\nas we have seen above, relativism is no option for\nGoodman\u2014because it would make true statements true about\nversions only\u2014we arrive at Goodman\u2019s pluralism: conflicting true\nversions correspond to different worlds.\nThe second line of reasoning in Goodman\u2019s writings toys with the\nidea that there are no worlds that the right versions answer\nto\u2014or at the very least that such worlds are not necessary. The\nworld versions suffice, and are really the only things that are\ndirectly accessible, anyway. The versions can for many purposes be\ntreated as worlds (WW, 4 and 96; cmp. MM, 30\u201333).\nGoodman of course recognizes a difference between versions and\nworlds. A version can be in English and comprise words. Worlds are\nneither in English nor comprise words. However, for a version that is\ntrue of a world, the world has to answer to it in a way. A world that\n\u201ccorresponds\u201d to (S1), for example, is a world with\nplanets and spacetime that is so arranged that one of the planets,\nEarth, is at rest in it. But \u201cplanet\u201d,\n\u201cspacetime\u201d, \u201cat rest\u201d, and so on are ways to\ncategorize reality that depend on a version. These predicates are the\nones chosen in this very version. There was no world that came ordered\nin correspondence with these predicates before this version was\nconstructed. Instead, the world corresponds to the version expressed\nby (S1), because the world with that structure was made, when that\nversion was made.\nBut what are worlds made of? Should we not at least assume Reality\nto be some kind of stuff that allows structuring with alternative\nversions as dough allows structuring with a cookie-cutter? Does there\nnot have to be some substance for our versions to project structure\nonto? According to Goodman, this \u201ctolerant realist view\u201d\nthat a plurality of worlds can be versions of a unique underlying\nReality is also nothing but a useless addition. A Reality underlying\nthe worlds must be unstructured and neutral, and thus serves no\npurpose. If there are many equally satisfactory versions of the world\nthat are mutually incompatible, then there is not very much left that\nthe \u201cneutral Reality\u201d could be. Reality would have no\nplanets, no motion, no spacetime, no relations, no points, no\nstructure at all. One can assume there is such a thing, Goodman seems\nto admit, but only because Reality is really not worth fighting for\n(or fighting against, for that matter). If we can tell true from false\nversions and explain why some are true versions and others false\nversions of worlds without assuming anything like an underlying\nreality, why assume it then? Parsimony considerations should lead us\nto refrain from postulating it.\n6.2 Worldmaking\nWhile Goodman insists that \u201cthere are many worlds, if\nany\u201d (MM, 127; see also MM, 31), Goodman\u2019s worlds should not be\nconflated with possible worlds. There are no merely possible Goodman\nworlds, they are all actual (WW, 94 and 104; MM, 31). It is Goodman\u2019s\nview that worlds are \u201cmade\u201d by answering to right\nversions, but there are no (merely possible) worlds that correspond to\nfalse versions. It is important to note that this view does not\ncollapse into irrationalism or a fancy form of cultural relativism\nfavored by postmodern thinkers. Making a true version is not\ntrivial. Not surprisingly, it is not any easier than making a true\nversion is for a realist. How we make true versions is absolutely the\nsame on both accounts; the difference is only with respect\nto what we do when we make true versions (see WW and\nMcCormick 1996 for discussion).\nThe constraints on worldmaking are strict. We cannot just create\nthings; predicates must be entrenched and thus there must be some\nclose continuity with former versions. Simplicity will keep us from\ncreating new things from scratch, coherence from making anything in\nconflict with beliefs with higher initial credibility, and so on.\nA world is made by making a world version. So, according to\nGoodman, the making of a world version is what has to be understood.\nCarnap\u2019s Aufbau, as already mentioned, presents a world\nversion, the systems in A Study of Qualities and The\nStructure of Appearance are world versions, and so are scientific\ntheories. The heliocentric and geocentric worldviews are relatively\nprimitive world versions, while Einstein\u2019s theory of general\nrelativity is a more sophisticated one. World versions do not have to\nbe constructed in a formal language, though; indeed, they do not need\nto be in a language, formal or informal, at all. The symbol systems\nused in the arts\u2014such as in painting, for instance\u2014can be\nused in the process of worldmaking too. It is in this sense that\nphilosophy, science, and art are all epistemically significant; they\nall contribute to our understanding; they all help to create\nworlds.\nMaking a world version is difficult. Acknowledging a great number\nof them does not make it easier. The hard work lies, for example, in\ncreating a constructional system that overcomes the problems of its\npredecessors, is simple, uses well-entrenched predicates, or\nsuccessfully replaces them with new ones (which is even harder),\nallows us to make useful predictions and so on. For Goodman,\nscientists, artists, and philosophers are faced with analogous\nproblems in this.\nGoodman\u2019s insistence that we make worlds when we make their\nversions and that we might just as well replace talking about worlds\nwith talk about versions creates a problem that is not simply solved\nby acknowledging that making a true version is very hard. Making a\nversion and making the objects that the version is about are clearly\ntwo different tasks. As Israel Scheffler writes in the abstract to\n\u201cThe Wonderful Worlds of Goodman\u201d:\n\nThe worldmaking urged by Goodman is elusive: Are worlds to be\nidentified with (true) world-versions or do they rather comprise what\nis referred to by such versions? Various passages in [WW] suggest one\nanswer, various passages another. That versions are made is easy to\naccept; that the things they refer to are, equally, made, I find\nunacceptable. (Scheffler 1979, 618)\n\nIndeed, Scheffler argues, Goodman confusingly uses\n\u201cworld\u201d and \u201cworldmaking\u201d both in a versional\nand in an objectual sense. As we said above, Goodman\u2019s claim is that\nwe make a world in the objectual sense by making a version of it.  The\nclaim is based on his conviction that the only structure of the world\nto which all true versions correspond does not exist independently;\nrather, it is only to be found because we project this structure onto\nthe world with our conceptualizations. His favorite example is the\nconstellation known as \u201cBig Dipper\u201d. Indeed, we\n\u201cmade\u201d the Big Dipper by picking out one arbitrary\nconstellation of stars and naming it. (More precisely, it is a\nso-called asterism that is part of the constellation Ursa\nMajor\u2014but the point still stands.) Which arrangement of\nheavenly bodies makes up the Big Dipper is purely conventional and\nhence only due to our conceptualization. Hilary Putnam (1992a)\nsuggests that this idea may have some plausibility for the Big Dipper,\nbut it does not, for instance, hold true of the stars that constitute\nthe Big Dipper. True, \u201cstar\u201d is a concept with partly\nconventional boundaries; however, that the concept \u201cstar\u201d\nhas conventional elements does not make it a matter of convention that\n\u201cstar\u201d applies to something (and thus merely a matter of\nmaking a world version).\nPutnam also points out that there is a tension between Goodman\u2019s\nnotion of worldmaking and his first line of thought that leads to his\nirrealism: the idea that there are conflicting statements in different\nadequate world versions. As Putnam argues, to say that a statement of\none world version is incompatible with that of another (such that a\nsingle world cannot accommodate both versions) requires that the\nexpressions in the two versions have the same meaning. However, it is\nnot clear that our ordinary notion of meaning allows such\ninter-version comparison of sameness of meaning (a thought that\nGoodman should be sympathetic to, since he already doubts an\nintra-version notion of that kind). Moreover, there might be better\nways to compare alternative versions (e.g., by way of\nhomomorphism-relations between versions, as developed by Goodman in SA\nand discussed above in 4.1) and to explain how versions relate despite\ntheir apparent incompatibility (for example, by paying attention to\nthe practice of scientists who manage to move from one version to\nanother).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a id=\"PriSou\">A.
