    "main_text": "\n\n\nPaul-Henri Thiry, Baron d\u2019Holbach was a philosopher, translator,\nand prominent social figure of the French Enlightenment. In his\nphilosophical writings Holbach developed a deterministic and\nmaterialistic metaphysics, which grounded his polemics against\norganized religion as well as his utilitarian ethical and political\ntheory. As a translator, Holbach made significant contributions to the\nEuropean Enlightenment in science and religion. He translated German\nworks on chemistry and geology into French, summarizing many of the\nGerman advances in these areas in his entries in Diderot\u2019s\nEncyclopedia.  Holbach also translated important English works on\nreligion and political philosophy into French. Holbach remains best\nknown, however, for his role in Parisian society. The close circle of\nintellectuals that Holbach hosted and, in various ways, sponsored\nproduced the Encyclopedia and a number of revisionary religious,\nethical, and political works that contributed to the ideological basis\nfor the French Revolution. Despite the radical views of many members\nof his coterie, however, Holbach\u2019s broader visiting guest list\nincluded many of the most prominent intellectual and political figures\nin Europe. His salon, then, was at once a shelter for radical thought\nand a hub of mainstream culture.\n",
