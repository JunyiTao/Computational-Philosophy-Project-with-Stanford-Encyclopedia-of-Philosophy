    "main_text": "The Basic Structure of the Conventional Formulation || Effective Field Theories and Renormalization\n2.4 Effective Field Theories and Renormalization\n\n\nIn the 1970s a program emerged in which the theories of the standard\nmodel of elementary particle physics are considered as effective field\ntheories (EFTs) which have a common quantum field theoretical\nframework. EFTs describe relevant phenomena only in a certain domain\nsince the Lagrangian contains only those terms that describe particles\nwhich are relevant for the respective range of energy. EFTs are\ninherently approximative and change with the range of energy\nconsidered. EFTs are only applicable on a certain energy scale, i.e.,\nthey only describe phenomena in a certain range of energy. Influences\nfrom higher energy processes contribute to average values but they\ncannot be described in detail. This procedure has no severe\nconsequences since the details of low-energy theories are largely\ndecoupled from higher energy processes. Both domains are only\nconnected by altered coupling constants and the renormalization group\ndescribes how the coupling constants depend on the energy.\n\n\nThe main idea of EFTs is that theories, i.e., in particular the\nLagrangians, depend on the energy of the phenomena which are\nanalysed. The physics changes by switching to a different energy\nscale, e.g., new particles can be created if a certain energy\nthreshold is exceeded. The dependence of theories on the energy\nscale distinguishes QFT from, e.g., Newton\u2019s theory of gravitation\nwhere the same law applies to an apple as well as to the moon.\nNevertheless, laws from different energy scales are not completely\nindependent of each other. A central aspect of considerations about\nthis dependence are the consequences of higher energy processes on the\nlow-energy scale.\n\n\nOn this background a new attitude towards renormalization developed in\nthe 1970s, which revitalizes earlier ideas that divergences result\nfrom neglecting unknown processes of higher energies. Low-energy\nbehavior is thus affected by higher energy processes. Since higher\nenergies correspond to smaller distances this dependence is to be\nexpected from an atomistic point of view. According to the\nreductionist program the dynamics of constituents on the microlevel\nshould determine processes on the macrolevel, i.e., here the\nlow-energy processes. However, as, for instance hydrodynamics shows,\nin practice theories from different levels are not quite as closely\nconnected because a law which is applicable on the macrolevel can be\nlargely independent of microlevel details. For this reason analogies\nwith statistical mechanics play an important role in the discussion\nabout EFTs. The basic idea of this new story about renormalization is\nthat the influences of higher energy processes are localizable in a\nfew structural properties which can be captured by an adjustment of\nparameters. \u201cIn this picture, the presence of infinities in\nquantum field theory is neither a disaster, nor an asset. It is simply\na reminder of a practical limitation\u2014we do not know what happens\nat distances much smaller than those we can look at directly\u201d\n(Georgi 1989: 456). This new attitude supports the view that\nrenormalization is the appropriate answer to the change of fundamental\ninteractions when the QFT is applied to processes on different energy\nscales. The price one has to pay is that EFTs are only valid in a\nlimited domain and should be considered as approximations to better\ntheories on higher energy scales. This prompts the important question\nwhether there is a last fundamental theory in this tower of EFTs which\nsupersede each other with rising energies. Some people conjecture\nthat this deeper theory could be a string theory, i.e., a theory which\nis not a field theory any more. Or should one ultimately expect from\nphysics theories that they are only valid as approximations and in a\nlimited domain? Hartmann (2001) and Castellani (2002) discuss the fate\nof reductionism vis-\u00e0-vis EFTs. Williams (2019) argues that EFTs by no means undermine a realist interpretation of QFT, provided one adopts a more refined notion of scientific realism. Wallace (2011) and Fraser\n(2011) discuss what the successful application of renormalization\nmethods in quantum statistical mechanics means for their role in QFT,\nreaching very different conclusions. Egg et al. (2017) review that debate by comparing it to Bohmian QFT.\n",
