Music and Universal Harmony\n\nOf all the mixed-mathematical disciplines in which Mersenne took an\ninterest, music was undeniably the one to which he devoted the most\neffort and passion. His 1623 Quaestiones already included a\nlong musicological digression on the therapeutic power attributed to\nthe music of the Hebrews, and generally to the music of the Ancients,\nwhose harmonics he dreamed of restoring. The idea was taken up and\ndeveloped in the 1627 Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019harmonie\nuniverselle, published under the transparent pseudonym of\n\u201cSieur de Sermes\u201d. The science of intellectual music and\nthe understanding of the proportions that govern nature, lost through\nnegligence, must be restored and linked to the science of\n\u201csensual music\u201d, which addresses our hearing but which,\nseparated from the former, is no longer able to fulfill its true\nfunction: elevating the senses above material objects, rather than\nlinking them together. Mersenne\u2019s great work on musical theory,\nthe eight books of Harmonie Universelle, was published from\n1636 to 1637. It presents a great many editorial variants, as Mersenne\nnever ceased to work on it, annotating his own copy. The important\n\u201cTrait\u00e9 de la nature du son\u201d, which constitutes the\nfirst part of the work, focuses on the study, undertaken in a\nmechanistic spirit, of acoustic quantities, their physical nature and\ntheir effects on physiology and passions. Mersenne, drawing on Isaac\nBeeckman, establishes experimentally the laws connecting the\nvibration, the length and tension of the strings, making an important\ncontribution to acoustic science.\n\nEpistemological, metaphysical and aesthetic aspects are intertwined in\nMersenne\u2019s musical agenda. Music was to Mersenne a\nmixed-mathematical science, just as astronomy, whose primary aim was\nto \u201csave the phenomena\u201d through more or less plausible\nhypotheses. The musical phenomena par excellence is\n\u201cconsonance\u201d, that is the fact that certain sounds put\ntogether are agreeable to the ear. Recent musical practices, new\ninstruments and polyphonic music had disclosed new modes of consonance\nthat were previously unknown, and Mersenne saw his proper task in an\neffort to find the best physico-mathematical hypotheses that would be\nable to account for them, and could be used to invent more\n\u201cperfect\u201d musical pieces (chants). Seeking such\nhypotheses, Mersenne relentlessly asked his correspondents how they\ncould account for the fact that certain sounds put together are\nagreeable and others not. For example, in November 1627, he asked a\ncorrespondent in Rome:\n\n\nIf the said Galileus be at Rome or if you should know some other\nexcellent mathematician-musician, I pray you to find out from him why,\nof all the sounds put together, only those which form the octave, the\nfifth, the third, and the sixth and their replicas are agreeable to\nthe ear, and which of all the dissonances is the most disagreeable one\nand why. I have been told that the said Galilei knows this reason. (MC\nI: 603, translated in Mace 1970: 8)\n\n\nMersenne\u2019s own general hypothesis was that consonance was due to\nthe coincidence of the vibrations of the air, which itself depended on\ncertain exact ratios in the mechanical properties of the instrument,\ne.g., the length, tension and breadth of the strings. However, as\nconsonance was judged by the ear rather than directly by reason,\ndiscrepancies were found. For example, experiments showed that the ear\nhears an octave when the tensions of the strings are in a ratio of 1\nto 4.25, whereas the physico-mathematical, Pythagorean, hypothesis\nprescribed 1 to 4. So here one would have to find ways to correct, or\n\u201cdiscipline\u201d experience through reason, in a move that is\nquite typical of Mersenne\u2019s epistemology (see Dear 1988).\n\nIn spite of those discrepancies, Mersenne was truly fascinated by the\nfact that the human mind, in its musical appreciation, is so to speak\nattuned to mathematical harmonies. The perception of consonance\nalthough mediated (and perhaps distorted) by our feeling, is not mere\nsensual pleasure, as Descartes, for example, seemed to think. Properly\nunderstood, it has a rational dimension, as it discloses to men the\n\u201cuniversal harmony\u201d, the underlying mathematical order\nthat is present at every level of reality, and that connects them\ntogether. Mersenne could have found in Kepler\u2019s Harmonices\nmundi the idea of such an archetypal harmony, ordering each level\nof reality, and innate to the human mind. He did not accept however\nKepler\u2019s rather dismissive view of music, which had led him to\ndefine harmonics in purely geometrical terms, stripped from whatever\nis sensorial and \u201cacoustic\u201d in it.\n\nContrary to what is sometimes held, the seeming adoption of an\nintegral mechanism in the last musical works is no renunciation of the\nmetaphysical consideration in harmonics. According to De Buzon (1994:\n127, my translation), the causes and effects of consonance are indeed\ntreated physically, but the pleasure taken to harmonics, \u201calbeit\nan ordinary experience, is a phenomenon that is entirely\ntheological\u201d. Musical pleasure shows both our destination and\nour state in this world. It raises us to the contemplation of the\ndivine unity, which is so to speak embodied in musical unison:\n\n\nconsonances depend on the unison as lines on the point, number on\nunity, and creatures on God. That is why the more they approach it the\nsweeter they become; because consonances have nothing sweet nor\nagreeable but that which they borrow from union of their sounds, which\nis the greater as it approaches unison. (HU II: Livre Premier des\nconsonances, 15, translated in Mace 1970: 13)\n\n\nBut musical pleasure also reveals our imperfect and sensuous nature.\nThus, for instance, although \u201cunison\u201d is the simplest and\nmost divine harmony, we tend to prefer in this world other, less\nperfect consonances and even dissonance.\n\nIn considering the general interconnection of sciences, Mersenne\ngranted music an almost architectonic function. All the sciences\nborrow something from each other. As manifested in the encyclopedic\ncharacter of the Harmonie Universelle, music was for Mersenne\nas the connecting principle of the various disciplines, allowing for\ntheir exposition. A thorough investigation of musical properties\nrequires forays into theology, moral philosophy (the passions of the\nsoul), optics, arithmetic and geometry, and of course mechanics as\nsounds are motions of the air, that have to be accounted for in a\nmechanical way. Conversely, and at a deeper level, music may be seen\nas a total science, theoretically capable of representing the\nproportions that exist between all parts of the mechanical\nuniverse:\n\n\nit is also easy to conclude that one can represent everything in the\nworld and, consequently all the sciences, by means of Sound; for,\nsince everything consists in weight, number and measure, and sounds\nrepresent these three properties, they can signify anything one\nwishes, excluding metaphysics. (HU 1: 43)\n\n\nIn particular music may teach men how, through motions, objects\ncommunicate their properties to the senses, which themselves are like\ninstruments, more or less well attuned to the external motions of the\nsensible. Music would then become the general science of the\nproperties of the sensible, a kind of general aesthesis uniting mixed\nmathematics in one universal science, whose acquisition would make our\nelevation to the consideration of the first cause easier (QT:\n161).\n",
