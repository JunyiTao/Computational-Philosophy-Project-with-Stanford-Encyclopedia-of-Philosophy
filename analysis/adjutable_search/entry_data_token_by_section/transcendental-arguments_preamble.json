    "main_text": "\n\nAs standardly conceived, transcendental arguments are taken to be\ndistinctive in involving a certain sort of claim, namely that\nX is a necessary condition for the possibility of\nY\u2014where then, given that Y is the case, it\nlogically follows that X must be the case too. Moreover,\nbecause these arguments are generally used to respond to sceptics who\ntake our knowledge claims to be problematic, the Y in\nquestion is then normally taken to be some fact about us or our mental\nlife which the sceptic can be expected to accept without question\n(e.g., that we have experiences, or make certain judgements, or\nperform certain actions, or have certain capacities, and so on), where\nX is then something the sceptic doubts or denies (e.g., the\nexistence of the external world, or of the necessary causal relation\nbetween events, or of other minds, or the force of moral reasons). In\nthis way, it is hoped, scepticism can be overturned using\ntranscendental arguments that embody such transcendental claims.\n\nAt first sight, this anti-sceptical potential of such arguments makes\nthem seem powerful and attractive, by offering a proof of what\notherwise might seem to be known only through inductive reasoning or\nfallible experience. However, as we shall see, transcendental\narguments conceived of in this ambitious form have struggled to live\nup to this promise, though they still have their devotees.\nNonetheless, the potential for such arguments has been kept alive, by\nreassessing their possible uses, where it has been suggested that they\ncan perhaps be given a more modest role, which then makes them more\nviable and enables their apparent difficulties to be set aside.\nWhether this is indeed the case, and whether even if it is, this then\nleaves them denuded of their anti-sceptical value and allure, remains\nan open question, and will be discussed further below. We will then\ndiscuss some recent developments in modal metaphysics and epistemology\nto see if they provide useful conceptual resources. We will also\nconsider how far transcendental arguments can serve a role not just in\nepistemology in defending our claims to knowledge, but also in ethics,\nin persuading the sceptic of the force of certain moral considerations\nand principles. Moreover, we will briefly discuss how transcendental\narguments have been used in philosophy of psychology and perception,\nwhere anti-scepticism is often not the goal.\n",
