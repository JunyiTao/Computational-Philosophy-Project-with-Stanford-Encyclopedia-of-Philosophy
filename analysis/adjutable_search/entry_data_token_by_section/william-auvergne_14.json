    "main_text": "The Soul || The Human Soul and the Human Being\n7.3 The Human Soul and the Human Being\n\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of William\u2019s teaching about the\nsoul is his identification of the human soul with the human being and\nhis denial that the human body constitutes in whole or part the human\nbeing. Instead, William describes the body variously as a house, the\nsoul its inhabitant; as a prison, the soul its captive; as a cloak,\nthe soul its wearer, and so on. Nevertheless, the definition of a\nhuman being\u2014he perhaps has in mind the Platonic conception of\nthe human being as \u201ca soul using a body\u201d\u2014involves a\nreference to the body, and it this, William thinks, that has led\npeople to believe that the body is a part of a human being. But this\nis an error akin to thinking that because a horseman is defined by\nreference to a horse, the horse must therefore be a part of the\nhorseman. William is aware, of course, that at times we do seem to\nascribe to ourselves, and thus to the human being, the acts of the\nbody or things that happen to the body, but he holds that these are\nnon-literal modes of speaking, akin to a rich man\u2019s complaint\nthat he has been struck by hail, when in fact it was his vineyard that\nwas struck.\n\nWilliam, as usual, offers numerous arguments for the identification of\nthe soul and human being. He argues that the body cannot be a part of\na human being, since the soul and body no more produce a true unity\nthan, for example, a carpenter and his ax, and a human being is a true\nunity. And he notes that since the soul is subject to reward and\npunishment in the afterlife for actions we correctly attribute to the\nhuman being or ourselves, it must be identified with the human being.\nHe also points to cases where our use of names or demonstratives\nreferring to human beings must be understood as referring to their\nsouls, and concludes that this shows that human beings are their\nsouls.\n",
