    "main_text": "Policies and Institutions || General Measures\n6.1 General Measures\n\nThere is general agreement that states cannot distribute personal\nrelationship goods\u2014or the relationships that generate\nthem\u2014directly, but it can shape society in numerous ways that\nwould affect both the existence and the distribution of these goods\n(Brake 2017; Cordelli 2015a). More specifically, policies and\ninstitutions\u2014including social norms\u2014can enable people to\nmeet other people in conditions that make them more likely to relate\nto them in personal ways, encourage people to voluntarily enter\npersonal relationships and influence people\u2019s internal resources\nand abilities to have good relationships (Cordelli 2015a).\n\nCare ethicists who believe that care-giving should be treated as a\nprimary good advocate the creation of social safety networks to\nsupport care-givers and make sure that, by performing the\ntime-intensive work of care, they do not end up socially disadvantaged\n(Kittay 1999). One view is that we ought to socially support\ncare-giving through a restructuring of economies, such that all\nindividuals have access to jobs remunerated well enough to allow them\nto care for themselves and their dependents (Engster 2007; Cordelli\n2015a) and, moreover, that jobs should not systematically interfere\nwith workers\u2019 ability to care, and that governments should\nensure enough caring services (Engster 2007).\n\nBut more specific measures have also been proposed in order to ensure\nthat all individuals have access to personal relationships and their\ngoods\u2014including caring relationships. Most generally, states\ncould educate citizens to be competent care-givers (Brake 2017) and\neven target boys as future care-givers (Behrends & Schouten 2017).\nMore generally, states could inculcate sociability through education\n(Cordelli 2015a). Further, states could support the civil society by\nencouraging volunteering and educational organizations (Cordelli\n2015a), for example by using tax-incentives to encourage engagement in\nvoluntary associations\u2014this could mean the provision of each\ncitizen with a voucher or tax-credit to be spent in support of\nqualifying associations that produce personal relationship goods\n(Cordelli 2015a). Also, states could create, run and subsidize\ncultural centers and social clubs (Brake 2017). They could also design\npublic spaces such that people have ample opportunities to socialize\non playgrounds, parks and other public spaces (Brake 2017; Brownlee\n2016a).\n\nBrake (2010, 2012) defends a radically reformed institution of\nmarriage, justified by reference to the goods created by caring\nrelationships between spouses, but which would allow individuals to\nde-bundle these goods and spread them across several relationships.\nCurrently, spouses can confer various advantages\u2014including\nrelational advantages\u2014on each other, but the institution of\nmarriage restrict access to these advantages by organizing them around\nmonogamous sexuality. If marriage were to be minimal, that is if\npeople could associate with each other for the sake of forming caring\n(and not necessarily sexual) relationships, and also to choose the\nnumber of partners and the kind of relational goods at the center of\ntheir union, this would give them more ample and fair opportunities to\nform and protect their caring relationships.\n\nBrownlee (2013, forthcoming) advocates a reform of the punishment and\nmedical care institutions to avoid long-term isolation whenever\npossible, in order to ensure that prisoners\u2019 and patients\u2019\nright against social deprivation is not violated. Quarantine, she\nthinks, should only be used when strictly necessary, and even then\nindividuals should be enabled to remain in touch with their near and\ndear with the help of technology; and particular individuals (such as\nparents) ought to be allowed to take more risks than they currently\nmay for the sake of avoiding separation from their children. She also\nargues that the practice of punishing through solitary confinement\nshould be abolished.\n\nFinally, several philosophers defended the proposal that states should\nensure everybody\u2019s access to caring relationships (which,\npresumably, includes access to some personal relationship goods) by\nrequiring all citizens to spend some time caring for those in need.\nThis policy could mean the creation of a \u201ccare corps\u201d\nservice based on conscription (Bubeck 1999; Fabre 2006; Robeyns 2011)\nor voluntary, state-incentivized, participation (Brake 2017).\nDepending on how such a service would be set up, it could encourage\nthe formation of robust, long-term personal relationships\u2014for\ninstance, by enabling continuity in care between the care-givers and\nthose in need for care. Yet, if there cannot be a duty to love, this\nproposal could only work for some, but not all personal relationship\ngoods.\n\nAs mentioned above, due to personal histories that go back to their\nchildhood, many people fail to enjoy personal relationship goods\naltogether (when they are unable to enter or maintain relationships)\nor else disproportionately struggle with the bads of personal\nrelationships. To the extent to which they are not responsible for\nthis situation, there is a case for arguing that they are entitled to\nsubsidized programs\u2014such as counseling or therapy\u2014to\nremedy their inability to relate to others in healthy ways.\n\nSome proposals have to do specifically with enabling adults to enjoy\nthe personal relationship goods that families make available. Richard\nArneson (2014) argues that non-parents ought to subsidize parents in\norder to ensure that the less well-off parents\u2014who would\notherwise need to spend most of their time in payed jobs\u2014have\naccess to the meaningful work of childrearing.\n",
