Aumann\u2019s surprising result\nis that even if agents condition their beliefs on private information,\nmere common knowledge of their conditioned beliefs and a common prior\nprobability distribution implies that their beliefs cannot be\ndifferent, after all!\n\n\nProposition 3.1\n\nLet \\(\\Omega\\) be a finite set of states of the world. Suppose\nthat\n\nAgents \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) have a common prior probability\ndistribution \\(\\mu(\\cdot)\\) over the events of \\(\\Omega\\) such that\n\\(\\mu(\\omega) \\gt 0\\), for each \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\), and\nIt is common knowledge at \\(\\omega\\) that \\(i\\)\u2019s posterior\nprobability of event \\(E\\) is \\(q_i(E)\\) and that \\(j\\)\u2019s\nposterior probability of \\(E\\) is \\(q_j(E)\\).\n\n\nThen \\(q_i(E) = q_j(E)\\).\n\n\nProof.\n \n[Note that in the proof of this proposition, and in the sequel,\n\\(\\mu(\\cdot\\mid B)\\) denotes conditional probability; that is, given\n\\(\\mu(B)\\gt 0, \\mu(A\\mid B) = \\mu(A\\cap B)/\\mu(B)\\).]\n\n\nIn a later article, Aumann (1987) argues that the assumptions that\n\\(\\Omega\\) is finite and that \\(\\mu(\\omega) \\gt 0\\) for each \\(\\omega\n\\in \\Omega\\) reflect the idea that agents only regard as\n\u201creally\u201d possible a finite collection of salient worlds to\nwhich they assign positive probability, so that one can drop the\nstates with probability 0 from the description of the state space.\nAumann also notes that this result implicitly assumes that the agents\nhave common knowledge of their partitions, since a description of each\npossible world includes a description of the agents\u2019 possibility\nsets. And of course, this result depends crucially upon (i), which is\nknown as the common prior assumption (CPA).\n\nAumann\u2019s \u201cno disagreement\u201d theorem has been\ngeneralized in a number of ways in the literature. Cave 1983\ngeneralizes the argument to 3 agents. Bacharach 1985 extends it to\ncases in which agents observe each other\u2019s decisions rather than\nposteriors. Milgrom and Stokey, 1982 use it crucially for their\nno-trade theorem, applying no disagreement to show that speculative\ntrade is impossible. Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis 1982 generalize the\nargument to a dynamic setting in which two agents communicate their\nposterior probabilities back and forth until they reach an agreement\n\u2013 this particular take on the agreement theorem has been\ncharacterized in terms of dynamic epistemic logic by D\u00e9gremont\nand Roy, 2009 and applied to cases of epistemic peer disagreement by\nSillari 2019. McKelvey and Page 1986 further extend the results of\nGeanakoplos and Polemarchakis to the case of \\(n\\) individuals. (See\nalso Monderer and Samet 1989 and, for a survey, Geanakoplos 1994.)\n\nHowever, all of these \u201cno disagreement\u201d results raise the\nsame philosophical puzzle raised by Aumann\u2019s original result:\nHow are we to explain differences in belief? Aumann\u2019s result\nleaves us with two options: (1) admit that at some level, common\nknowledge of the agents\u2019 beliefs or how they form their beliefs\nfails, or (2) deny the CPA. Thus, even if agents do assign precise\nposterior probabilities to an event, Aumann shows that if they have\nmerely first-order mutual knowledge of the posteriors, they can\n\u201cagree to\n disagree\u201d.[18]\n Another way Aumann\u2019s result might fail is if agents do not have\ncommon knowledge that they update their beliefs by Bayesian\nconditionalization. Then clearly, agents can explain divergent\nopinions as the result of others having modified their beliefs in the\n\u201cwrong\u201d way. However, there are cases in which neither\nexplanation will seem convincing and denying the requisite common\nknowledge seems a rather ad hoc move. Why should one think\nthat such failures of common knowledge provide a general explanation\nfor divergent beliefs?\n\nWhat of the second option, that is, denying the\n CPA?[19]\n The main argument put forward in favor of the CPA is that any\ndifferences in agents\u2019 probabilities should be the result of\ntheir having different information only, that is, there is no reason\nto think that the different beliefs that agents have regarding the\nsame event are the result of anything other than their having\ndifferent information. However, one can reply that this argument\namounts simply to a restatement of the Harsanyi\n Doctrine.[20]\n3.2 Convention\n\nSchelling\u2019s Department Store problem of Example 1.5 is a very\nsimple example in which the agents \u201csolve\u201d their\ncoordination problem appropriately by establishing a\nconvention. (see also the entry on\n convention\n in this encyclopedia.) Using the vocabulary of game theory, Lewis\n(1969) defines a convention as a strict coordination\nequilibrium of a game which agents follow on account of their\ncommon knowledge that they all prefer to follow this coordination\nequilibrium in a recurrent coordination problem. A coordination\nequilibrium of a game is a strategy combination such that no agent is\nbetter off if any agent unilaterally deviates from this combination.\nAs with equilibria in general, a coordination equilibrium is\nstrict if any agent who deviates unilaterally from the\nequilibrium is strictly worse off. The strategic form game of Figure\n1.3 summarizes Liz\u2019s and Robert\u2019s situation. The\nDepartment Store game has four Nash equilibrium outcomes in pure\nstrategies: \\((s_1, s_1),\\) \\((s_2, s_2),\\) \\((s_3, s_3)\\), and\n\\((s_4,\n s_4)\\).[21]\n These four equilibria are all strict coordination equilibria. If the\nagents follow either of these equilibria, then they coordinate\nsuccessfully. For agents to be following a Lewis-convention in this\nsituation, they must follow one of the game\u2019s coordination\nequilibria. However, for Lewis to follow a coordination equilibrium is\nnot a sufficient condition for agents to be following a convention.\nFor suppose that Liz and Robert fail to analyze their predicament\nproperly at all, but Liz chooses \\(s_2\\) and Robert chooses \\(s_2\\),\nso that they coordinate at \\((s_2, s_2)\\) by sheer luck. Lewis does\nnot count accidental coordination of this sort as a convention.\n\nSuppose next that both agents are Bayesian rational, and that part of\nwhat each agent knows is the payoff structure of the Intersection\ngame. If the agents expect each other to follow \\((s_2, s_2)\\) and\nthey consequently coordinate successfully, are they then following a\nconvention? Not necessarily, contends Lewis in a subtle argument on p.\n59 of Convention. For while each agent knows the game and\nthat she is rational, still she might not attribute the same knowledge\nto the other agent. If each agent believes that the other agent will\nfollow her end of the \\((s_2, s_2)\\) equilibrium mindlessly, then her\nbest response is to follow her end of \\((s_2, s_2)\\). But in this case\nthe agents coordinated as the result of their each falsely believing\nthat the other acts like an automaton, and Lewis thinks that any\nproper account of convention must require that agents have\ncorrect beliefs about one another. In particular, Lewis\nrequires that each agent involved in a convention must have mutual\nexpectations that each is acting with the aim of coordinating with the\nother. The argument can be carried further on. What if both agents\nbelieve that they will follow \\((s_2, s_2)\\), and believe that each\nother will do so thinking that the other will choose \\(s_2\\)\nrationally and not mindlessly? Then, say, Liz would coordinate as the\nresult of her false second-order belief that Robert believes that Liz\nacts mindlessly. Similarly for third-order beliefs and so on for any\nhigher order of knowledge.\n\nLewis concludes that a necessary condition for agents to be following\na convention is that their preferences to follow the corresponding\ncoordination equilibrium be common knowledge (the issue whether\nconventions need to be common knowledge has been debated recently, cf.\nCubitt and Sugden 2003, Binmore 2008, Sillari 2008, and, for an\nexperimental approach, see Devetag et al. 2013, for a connection to\nthe topic of rule-following, see Sillari 2013). So on Lewis\u2019\naccount, a convention for a set of agents is a coordination\nequilibrium which the agents follow on account of their common\nknowledge of their rationality, the payoff structure of the relevant\ngame and that each agent follows her part of the equilibrium.\n\nA regularity \\(R\\) in the behavior of members of a population \\(P\\)\nwhen they are agents in a recurrent situation \\(S\\) is a\nconvention if and only if it is true that, and it is common\nknowledge in \\(P\\) that, in any instance of \\(S\\) among the members of\n\\(P\\),\n\n\neveryone conforms to \\(R\\);\neveryone expects everyone else to conform to \\(R\\);\neveryone has approximately the same preferences regarding all\npossible combinations of actions;\neveryone prefers that everyone conform to \\(R\\), on condition that\nat least all but one conform to R;\neveryone would prefer that everyone conform to \\(R'\\), on\ncondition that at least all but one conform to \\(R'\\),\n\n\nwhere \\(R'\\) is some possible regularity in the behavior of members of\n\\(P\\) in \\(S\\), such that no one in any instance of \\(S\\) among\nmembers of \\(P\\) could conform both to \\(R'\\) and to \\(R\\).\n\n(Lewis 1969, p.\n 76)[22]\n\n\nLewis includes the requirement that there be an alternate coordination\nequilibrium \\(R'\\) besides the equilibrium \\(R\\) that all follow in\norder to capture the fundamental intuition that how the agents who\nfollow a convention behave depends crucially upon how they expect the\nothers to behave.\n\nSugden (1986) and Vanderschraaf (1998) argue that it is not crucial to\nthe notion of convention that the corresponding equilibrium be a\ncoordination equilibrium. Lewis\u2019 key insight is that a\nconvention is a pattern of mutually beneficial behavior which depends\non the agents\u2019 common knowledge that all follow this\npattern, and no other. Vanderschraaf gives a more general definition\nof convention as a strict equilibrium together with common\nknowledge that all follow this equilibrium and that all would have\nfollowed a different equilibrium had their beliefs about each other\nbeen different. An example of this more general kind of convention is\ngiven below in the discussion of the Figure 3.1 example.\n3.3 Strategic Form Games\n\nLewis formulated the notion of common knowledge as part of his general\naccount of conventions. In the years following the publication of\nConvention, game theorists have recognized that any\nexplanation of a particular pattern of play in a game depends\ncrucially on mutual and common knowledge assumptions. More\nspecifically, solution concepts in game theory are both\nmotivated and justified in large part by the mutual or common\nknowledge the agents in the game have regarding their situation.\n\nTo establish the notation that will be used in the discussion that\nfollows, the usual definitions of a game in strategic form, expected\nutility and agents\u2019 distributions over their opponents\u2019\nstrategies, are given here:\n\n\nDefinition 3.2\n\nA game \\(\\Gamma\\) is an ordered triple \\((N, S,\n\\boldsymbol{u})\\) consisting of the following elements:\n\n\nA finite set \\(N = \\{1,2, \\ldots ,n\\}\\), called the set of\nagents or players.\nFor each agent \\(k \\in N\\), there is a finite set \\(S_k =\n\\{s_{k1},s_{k2}, \\ldots ,s_{kn_k}\\}\\), called the alternative pure\nstrategies for agent \\(k\\). The Cartesian product \\(S = S_1\n\\times \\ldots \\times S_n\\) is called the pure strategy set\nfor the game \\(\\Gamma\\).\nA map \\(\\boldsymbol{u} : S \\rightarrow \\Re^n,\\) called the\nutility or payoff function on the pure strategy set.\nAt each strategy combination \\(\\boldsymbol{s} = (s_{1j_1}, \\ldots\n,s_{nj_n}) \\in S\\), agent \\(k\\)\u2019s particular payoff or utility\nis given by the \\(k\\)th component of the value of\n\\(\\boldsymbol{u}\\), that is, agent \\(k\\)\u2019s utility \\(u_k\\) at\n\\(\\boldsymbol{s}\\) is determined by \n\n\\[\nu_k (\\boldsymbol{s}) = I_k (\\boldsymbol{u}(s_{1j_1}, \\ldots ,s_{nj_n}))\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(I_k (\\boldsymbol{x})\\) projects \\(\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\Re^n\\)\nonto its \\(k\\)th component. \n\n\n\nThe subscript \u2018\\(-k\\)\u2019 indicates the result of removing\nthe \\(k\\)th component of an \\(n\\)-tuple or an \\(n\\)-fold\nCartesian product. For instance, \n\n\\[\nS_{-k} = S_1 \\times \\ldots \\times S_{k-1} \\times S_{k+1} \\times \\ldots \\times S_n\n\\]\n\n\ndenotes the pure strategy combinations that agent \\(k\\)\u2019s\nopponents may play.\n\nNow let us formally introduce a system of the agents\u2019 beliefs\ninto this framework. \\(\\Delta_k (S_{-k})\\) denotes the set of\nprobability distributions over the measurable space \\((S_{-k},\n\\mathfrak{F}_k)\\), where \\(\\mathfrak{F}_k\\) denotes the Boolean\nalgebra generated by the strategy combinations \\(S_{-k}\\). Each agent\n\\(k\\) has a probability distribution \\(\\mu_k \\in \\Delta_k(S_{-k})\\),\nand this distribution determines the (Savage) expected\nutilities for each of \\(k\\)\u2019s possible acts:\n\n\\[\nE(u_k (s_{k j})) = \\sum_{A_{-k} \\in S_{-k}} u_k (s_{kj}, \\boldsymbol{s}_{-k}) \\mu_k (\\boldsymbol{s}_{-k}),\\ j = 1, 2, \\ldots ,n_k\n\\]\n\n\nIf \\(i\\) is an opponent of \\(k\\), then \\(i\\)\u2019s individual\nstrategy \\(s_{i j}\\) may be characterized as a union of strategy\ncombinations \\(\\bigcup\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_{-k}\\mid s_{ij}\\in\n\\boldsymbol{s}_{-k}\\} \\in \\mathfrak{F}_k\\), and so \\(k\\)\u2019s\nmarginal probability for \\(i\\)\u2019s strategy \\(s_{i j}\\) may be\ncalculated as follows: \n\n\\[\n\\mu_k (s_{ij}) = \\sum_{\\{s_{-k}\\mid s_{ij}\\in s_{-k}\\}} \\mu_{k}(s_{-k})\n\\]\n\n\n\\(\\mu_k(\\cdot \\mid A)\\) denotes \\(k\\)\u2019s conditional probability\ndistribution given a set \\(A\\), and \\(E(\\cdot \\mid A)\\) denotes\n\\(k\\)\u2019s conditional expectation given \\(\\mu_k(\\cdot\\mid\nA).\\)\n\nSuppose first that the agents have common knowledge of the full payoff\nstructure of the game they are engaged in and that they are all\nrational, and that no other information is common knowledge. In other\nwords, each agent knows that her opponents are expected utility\nmaximizers, but does not in general know exactly which strategies they\nwill choose or what their probabilities for her acts are. These common\nknowledge assumptions are the motivational basis for the solution\nconcept for noncooperative games known as rationalizability,\nintroduced independently by Bernheim (1984) and Pearce (1984). Roughly\nspeaking, a rationalizable strategy is any strategy an agent\nmay choose without violating common knowledge of Bayesian rationality.\nBernheim and Pearce argue that when only the structure of the game and\nthe agents\u2019 Bayesian rationality are common knowledge, the game\nshould be considered \u201csolved\u201d if every agent plays a\nrationalizable strategy. For instance, in the \u201cChicken\u201d\ngame with payoff structure defined by Figure 3.1,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJoanna \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\\(s_1\\)\n\\(s_2\\)  \n\n\nLizzi\n\\(s_1\\)\n(3,3)\n(2,4) \n\n\\(s_2\\)\n(4,2)\n(0,0)  \n\n\nFigure 3.1\n\n\nif Joanna and Lizzi have common knowledge of all of the payoffs at\nevery strategy combination, and they have common knowledge that both\nare Bayesian rational, then any of the four pure strategy profiles is\nrationalizable. For if their beliefs about each other are defined by\nthe probabilities \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\alpha_1 &= \\mu_1 \\text{ (Joanna plays } s_1), \\text{ and} \\\\\n\\alpha_2 &= \\mu_2 \\text{ (Lizzi plays } s_1)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nthen \n\n\\[\n E(u_i (s_1)) = 3\\alpha_i + 2(1 - \\alpha_i) = \\alpha_i + 2\n\\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[\n E(u_i (s_2)) = 4\\alpha_i + 0(1 - \\alpha_i) = 4\\alpha_i, \\ i = 1, 2\n\\]\n\n\nso each agent maximizes her expected utility by playing \\(s_1\\) if\n\\(\\alpha_i + 2 \\ge 4\\alpha_i\\) or \\(\\alpha_i \\le 2/3\\) and maximizes\nher expected utility by playing \\(s_2\\) if \\(\\alpha_i \\ge 2/3\\). If it\nso happens that \\(\\alpha_i \\gt 2/3\\) for both agents, then both\nconform with Bayesian rationality by playing their respective ends of\nthe strategy combination \\((s_2,s_2)\\) given their beliefs,\neven though each would want to defect from this strategy combination\nwere she to discover that the other is in fact going to play \\(s_2\\).\nNote that the game\u2019s pure strategy Nash equilibria, \\((s_1,\ns_2)\\) and \\((s_2, s_1)\\), are rationalizable, since it is rational\nfor Lizzi and Joanna to conform with either equilibrium given\nappropriate distributions. In general, the set of a game\u2019s\nrationalizable strategy combinations contains the set of the\ngame\u2019s pure strategy Nash\n equilibria.[23]\n\nRationalizability can be defined formally in several ways. A variation\nof Bernheim\u2019s original (1984) definition is given here.\n\n\nDefinition 3.3\n\nGiven that each agent \\(k \\in N\\) has a probability distribution\n\\(\\mu_k \\in \\Delta_k(s_{-k})\\), the system of beliefs \n\n\\[\n  \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = (\\mu_1 , \\ldots ,\\mu_n) \\in \\Delta_1 (S_{-1}) \\times \\cdots \\times \\Delta_n (S_{-n})\n\\]\n\n\nis Bayes concordant if and only if,\n\n(3.i)\nFor \\(i \\ne k, \\mu_i (s_{kj}) \\gt 0 \\Rightarrow s_{kj}\\) maximizes\n\\(k\\)\u2019s expected utility for some \\(\\sigma_k \\in\n\\Delta_k(s_{-k}),\\)\n\n\nand (3.i) is common knowledge. A pure strategy combination\n\\(\\boldsymbol{s} = (s_{1j_1}, \\ldots ,s_{nj_n}) \\in S\\) is\nrationalizable if and only if the agents have a Bayes\nconcordant system \\(\\mu\\) of beliefs and, for each\nagent \\(k \\in N\\),\n\n(3.ii)\n\\(E(u_k (s_{kj_k})) \\ge E(u_k (s_{ki_k})),\\) for \\(i_k \\ne\n j_k\\).[24]\n\n\n\n\nThe following result shows that the common knowledge restriction on\nthe distributions in Definition 3.1 formalizes the assumption that the\nagents have common knowledge of Bayesian rationality.\n\n\nProposition 3.4\n\nIn a game \\(\\Gamma\\), common knowledge of Bayesian rationality is\nsatisfied if, and only if, (3.i) is common knowledge.\n\nProof.\n\n\nWhen agents have common knowledge of the game and their Bayesian\nrationality only, one can predict that they will follow a\nrationalizable strategy profile. However, rationalizability becomes an\nunstable solution concept if the agents come to know more about one\nanother. For instance, in the Chicken example above with \\(\\alpha_i\n\\gt 2/3, i = 1, 2\\), if either agent were to discover the other\nagent\u2019s beliefs about her, she would have good reason not to\nfollow the \\((s_2,s_2)\\) profile and to revise her own beliefs\nregarding the other agent. If, in the other hand, it so happens that\n\\(\\alpha_1 = 1\\) and \\(\\alpha_2 = 0\\), so that the agents maximize\nexpected payoff by following the \\((s_2, s_1)\\) profile, then should\nthe agents discover their beliefs about each other, they will still\nfollow \\((s_2, s_1)\\). Indeed, if their beliefs are common knowledge,\nthen one can predict with certainty that they will follow\n\\((s_2,s_1)\\). The Nash equilibrium \\((s_2,s_1)\\) is characterized by\nthe belief distributions defined by \\(\\alpha_1 = 1\\) and \\(\\alpha_2 =\n0\\).\n\nThe Nash equilibrium is a special case of correlated equilibrium\nconcepts, which are defined in terms of the belief distributions\nof the agents in a game. In general, a correlated\nequilibrium-in-beliefs is a system of agents\u2019 probability\ndistributions which remains stable given common knowledge of the game,\nrationality and the beliefs themselves. We will review two\nalternative correlated equilibrium concepts (Aumann 1974, 1987;\nVanderschraaf 1995, 2001), and show how each generalizes the Nash\nequilibrium concept.\n\n\nDefinition 3.5\n\nGiven that each agent \\(k \\in N\\) has a probability distribution\n\\(\\mu_k \\in \\Delta_k (s_{-k})\\), the system of beliefs\n\n\\[\n \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^* = (\\mu_1^*, \\ldots ,\\mu_n^* ) \\in \\Delta_1 (s_{-1}) \\times \\ldots \\times \\Delta_n (s_{-n})\n\\]\n\n\nis an endogenous correlated equilibrium if, and only if,\n\n(3.iii)\n For \\(i \\ne k, \\mu_i^*(s_{kj}) \\gt 0 \\Rightarrow s_{kj}\\)\nmaximizes \\(k\\)\u2019s expected utility given \\(\\mu_k^*.\\)\n\n\nIf \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^*\\) is an endogenous correlated equilibrium a\npure strategy combination \\(\\boldsymbol{s}^* = (s_1^*, \\ldots ,s_n^*)\n\\in S\\) is an endogenous correlated equilibrium strategy\ncombination given \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^*\\) if, and only if, for\neach agent \\(k \\in N,\\)\n\n(3.iv)\n\\(E(u_k (s_k^*)) \\ge E(u_k (s_{ki}))\\) for \\(s_{ki} \\ne\ns_k^*.\\)\n\n\n\nHence, the endogenous correlated equilibrium \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^*\\)\nrestricts the set of strategies that the agents might follow, as do\nthe Bayes concordant beliefs of rationalizability. However, the\nendogenous correlated equilibrium concept is a proper refinement of\nrationalizability, because the latter does not presuppose that\ncondition (3.iii) holds with respect to the beliefs one\u2019s\nopponents actually have. If exactly one pure strategy combination\n\\(\\boldsymbol{s}^*\\) satisfies (3.iv) given \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^*\\),\nthen \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^*\\) is a strict equilibrium, and in\nthis case one can predict with certainty what the agents will do given\ncommon knowledge of the game, rationality and their beliefs. Note that\nDefinition 3.5 says nothing about whether or not the agents regard\ntheir opponents\u2019 strategy combinations as probabilistically\nindependent. Also, this definition does not require that the\nagents\u2019 probabilities are consistent, in the sense that\nagents\u2019 probabilities for a mutual opponent\u2019s acts agree.\nA simple refinement of the endogenous correlated equilibrium concept\ncharacterizes the Nash equilibrium concept.\n\n\nDefinition 3.6\n\nA system of agents\u2019 beliefs \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^*\\) is a Nash\nequilibrium if, and only if,\n\n\ncondition (3.iii) is satisfied,\nFor each \\(k \\in N, \\mu_k^*\\) satisfies probabilistic\nindependence, and\nFor each \\(s_{kj} \\in s_k\\), if \\(i, l \\ne k\\) then\n\\(\\mu_i^*(s_{kj}) = \\mu_l^*(s_{kj})\\).\n\n\n\nIn other words, an endogenous correlated equilibrium is a Nash\nequilibrium-in-beliefs when each agent regards the moves of his\nopponents as probabilistically independent and the agents\u2019\nprobabilities are consistent. Note that in the 2-agent case,\nconditions (b) and (c) of the Definition 3.6 are always satisfied, so\nfor 2-agent games the endogenous correlated equilibrium concept\nreduces to the Nash equilibrium concept. Conditions (b) and (c) are\ntraditionally assumed in game theory, but Skyrms (1991) and\nVanderschraaf (1995, 2001) argue that there may be good reasons to\nrelax these assumptions in games with 3 or more agents.\n\nBrandenburger and Dekel (1988) show that in 2-agent games, if the\nbeliefs of the agents are common knowledge, condition (3.iii)\ncharacterizes a Nash equilibrium-in-beliefs. As they note, condition\n(3.iii) characterizes a Nash equilibrium in beliefs for the\n\\(n\\)-agent case if the probability distributions are consistent and\nsatisfy probabilistic independence. Proposition 3.7 extends\nBrandenburger and Dekel\u2019s result to the endogenous correlated\nequilibrium concept by relaxing the consistency and probabilistic\nindependence assumptions.\n\n\nProposition 3.7\n\nAssume that the probabilities \n\n\\[\n \\mu = (\\mu_1 ,\\ldots ,\\mu_n) \\in \\Delta_1 (s_{-1}) \\times \\ldots \\times \\Delta_n (s_{-n})\n\\]\n\n\nare common knowledge. Then common knowledge of Bayesian rationality is\nsatisfied if, and only if, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) is an endogenous\ncorrelated equilibrium.\n\nProof.\n\n\nIn addition, we have:\n\n\nCorollary 3.8 (Brandenburger and Dekel, 1988)\n\nAssume in a 2-agent game that the probabilities \n\n\\[\n \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = (\\mu_1,\\mu_2) \\in \\Delta_1 (s_{-1}) \\times \\Delta_2 (s_{-2})\n\\]\n\n\nare common knowledge. Then common knowledge of Bayesian rationality is\nsatisfied if, and only if, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) is a Nash\nequilibrium.\n\nProof.\n\nThe endogenous correlated equilibrium concept reduces to the Nash\nequilibrium concept in the 2-agent case, so the corollary follows by\nProposition 3.7.\n\n\nIf \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^*\\) is a strict equilibrium, then one can\npredict which pure strategy profile the agents in a game will follow\ngiven common knowledge of the game, rationality and\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^*.\\) But if \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^*\\) is such that\nseveral distinct pure strategy profiles satisfy (3.iv) with respect to\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^*\\), then one can no longer predict with certainty\nwhat the agents will do. For instance, in the Chicken game of Figure\n3.1, the belief distributions defined by \\(\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2 = 2/3\\)\ntogether are a Nash equilibrium-in-beliefs. Given common knowledge of\nthis equilibrium, either pure strategy is a best reply for each agent,\nin the sense that either pure strategy maximizes expected utility.\nIndeed, if agents can also adopt randomized or mixed\nstrategies at which they follow one of several pure strategies\naccording to the outcome of a chance experiment, then any of the\ninfinitely mixed strategies an agent might adopt in Chicken is a best\nreply given\n \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^*\\).[25]\n So the endogenous correlated equilibrium concept does not determine\nthe exact outcome of a game in all cases, even if one assumes\nprobabilistic consistency and independence so that the equilibrium is\na Nash equilibrium.\n\nAnother correlated equilibrium concept formalized by Aumann (1974,\n1987) does give a determinate prediction of what agents will do in a\ngame given appropriate common knowledge. To illustrate Aumann\u2019s\ncorrelated equilibrium concept, let us consider the Figure 3.1 game\nonce more. If Joanna and Lizzi can tie their strategies to their\nknowledge of the possible worlds in a certain way, they can follow a\nsystem of correlated strategies which will yield a payoff vector they\nboth prefer to that of the mixed Nash equilibrium and which is itself\nan equilibrium. One way they can achieve this is to have their friend\nRon play a variation of the familiar shell game by hiding a pea under\none of three walnut shells, numbered 1, 2 and 3. Joanna and Lizzi both\nthink that each of the three relevant possible worlds corresponding to\n\\(\\omega_k = \\{\\)the pea lies under shell \\(k\\}\\) is equally likely.\nRon then gives Lizzi and Joanna each a private recommendation, based\nupon the outcome of the game, which defines a system of strategy\ncombinations f as follows \n\n\\[\\tag{\\(\\star\\)}\nf(\\omega) =\n\\begin{cases}\n (s_1, s_1) \\text{ if } \\omega_k = \\omega_1 \\\\\n (s_1, s_2) \\text{ if } \\omega_k = \\omega_2 \\\\\n (s_2, s_1) \\text{ if } \\omega_k = \\omega_3\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\\(f\\) is a correlated strategy system because the agents tie\ntheir strategies, by following their recommendations, to the same set\nof states of the world \\(\\Omega\\). \\(f\\) is also a strict Aumann\ncorrelated equilibrium, for if each agent knows how Ron makes his\nrecommendations, but knows only the recommendation he gives her,\neither would do strictly worse were she to deviate from her\n recommendation.[26]\n Since there are several strict equilibria of Chicken, \\(f\\)\ncorresponds to a convention as defined in Vanderschraaf (1998). The\noverall expected payoff vector of \\(f\\) is (3,3), which lies outside\nthe convex hull of the payoffs for the game\u2019s Nash equilibria\nand which Pareto-dominates the expected payoff vector (4/3, 4/3), of\nthe mixed Nash equilibrium defined by \\(\\alpha_1 = 2/3\\), \\(i = 1,\n 2.\\)[27]\n The correlated equilibrium f is characterized by the probability\ndistribution of the agents\u2019 play over the strategy profiles,\ngiven in Figure 3.3:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJoanna \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\\(s_1\\)\n\\(s_2\\)  \n\n\nLizzi\n\\(s_1\\)\n\u2153\n\u2153 \n\n\\(s_2\\)\n\u2153\n0  \n\n\nFigure 3.3\n\n\nAumann (1987) proves a result relating his correlated equilibrium\nconcept to common knowledge. To review this result, we must give the\nformal definition of Aumann correlated equilibrium.\n\n\nDefinition 3.9\n\nGiven a game \\(\\Gamma = (N, S, \\boldsymbol{u})\\) together with a\nfinite set of possible worlds \\(\\Omega\\), the vector valued function\n\\(f: \\Omega \\rightarrow S\\) is a correlated n-tuple. If\n\\(f(\\omega) = (f_1 (\\omega), \\ldots ,f_n (\\omega))\\) denotes the\ncomponents of \\(f\\) for the agents of \\(N\\), then agent \\(k\\)\u2019s\nrecommended strategy at \\(\\omega\\) is \\(f_k (\\omega).\\) \\(f\\)\nis an Aumann correlated equilibrium iff \n\n\\[\nE(u_k \\circ f) \\ge E(u_k (f_{-k}, g_k)),\n\\]\n\n\nfor each \\(k \\in N\\) and for any function \\(g_k\\) that is a function\nof \\(f_i\\).\n\n\nThe agents are at Aumann correlated equilibrium if at each possible\nworld \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\), no agent will want to deviate from his\nrecommended strategy, given that the others follow their recommended\nstrategies. Hence, Aumann correlated equilibrium uniquely specifies\nthe strategy of each agent, by explicitly introducing a space of\npossible worlds to which agents can correlate their acts. The\ndeviations \\(g_i\\) are required to be functions of \\(f_i\\), that is,\ncompositions of some other function with \\(f_i\\), because \\(i\\) is\ninformed of \\(f_i (\\omega)\\) only, and so can only distinguish between\nthe possible worlds of \\(\\Omega\\) that are distinguished by \\(f_i\\).\nAs noted already, the primary difference between Aumann\u2019s notion\nof correlated equilibrium and the endogenous correlated equilibrium is\nthat in Aumann\u2019s correlated equilibrium, the agents correlate\ntheir strategies to some event \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\) that is external\nto the game. One way to view this difference is that agents who\ncorrelate their strategies exogenously can calculate their expected\nutilities conditional on their own strategies.\n\nIn Aumann\u2019s model, a description of each possible world\n\\(\\omega\\) includes descriptions of the following: the game\n\\(\\Gamma\\), the agent\u2019s private information partitions, and the\nactions chosen by each agent at \\(\\omega\\), and each agent\u2019s\nprior probability distribution \\(\\mu_k(\\cdot)\\) over \\(\\Omega\\). The\nbasic idea is that conditional on \\(\\omega\\), everyone knows\neverything that can be the object of uncertainty on the part of any\nagent, but in general, no agent necessarily knows which world\n\\(\\omega\\) is the actual world. The agents can use their priors to\ncalculate the probabilities that the various act combinations\n\\(\\boldsymbol{s} \\in S\\) are played. If the agents\u2019 priors are\nsuch that for all \\(i, j \\in N,\\) \\(\\mu_i(\\omega) = 0\\) iff \\(\\mu_j\n(\\omega) = 0,\\) then the agents\u2019 priors are mutually\nabsolutely continuous. If the agents\u2019 priors all agree,\nthat is, \\(\\mu_1 (\\omega) = \\ldots = \\mu_n (\\omega) = \\mu(\\omega)\\)\nfor each \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\), then it is said that the common\nprior assumption, or CPA, is satisfied. If agents are following\nan Aumann correlated equilibrium \\(f\\) and the CPA is satisfied, then\n\\(f\\) is an objective Aumann correlated equilibrium. An\nAumann correlated equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium if the CPA is\nsatisfied and the agents\u2019 distributions satisfy probabilistic\n independence.[28]\n\nLet \\(s_i (\\omega)\\) denote the strategy chosen by agent \\(i\\) at\npossible world \\(\\omega\\). Then \\(s: \\Omega \\rightarrow S\\) defined by\n\\(s(\\omega) = ( s_1 (\\omega),\\ldots ,s_n (\\omega) )\\) is a correlated\n\\(n\\)-tuple. Given that \\(\\mathcal{H}_i\\) is a partition of\n \\(\\Omega\\),[29]\n the function \\(s_i : \\Omega \\rightarrow s_i\\) defined by \\(s\\) is\n\\(\\mathcal{H}_i\\)-measurable if for each \\(\\mathcal{H}_{ij}\n\\in \\mathcal{H}_{i}, s_i (\\omega')\\) is constant for each \\(\\omega'\n\\in \\mathcal{H}_{ij}.\\) \\(\\mathcal{H}_i\\)-measurability is a formal\nway of saying that \\(i\\) knows what she will do at each possible\nworld, given her information.\n\n\nDefinition 3.10\n\nAgent \\(i\\) is Bayes rational with respect to \\(\\omega \\in\n\\Omega\\) (alternatively, \\(\\omega\\)-Bayes rational) iff\n\\(s_i\\) is \\(\\mathcal{H}_i\\)-measurable and \n\n\\[\nE(u_i \\circ s \\mid \\mathcal{H}_i)(\\omega) \\ge E(u_i (v_i, s_{-i}) \\mid \\mathcal{H}_i)(\\omega)\n\\]\n\n\nfor any \\(\\mathcal{H}_i\\)-measurable function \\(v_i : \\Omega\n\\rightarrow s_i\\).\n\n\nNote that Aumann\u2019s definition of \\(\\omega\\)-Bayesian rationality\nimplies that \\(\\mu_i (\\mathcal{H}_i (\\omega)) \\gt 0\\), so that the\nconditional expectations are defined. Aumann\u2019s main result,\ngiven next, implicitly assumes that \\(\\mu_i (\\mathcal{H}_i (\\omega))\n\\gt 0\\) for every agent \\(i \\in N\\) and every possible world \\(\\omega\n\\in \\Omega\\). This poses no technical difficulties if the CPA is\nsatisfied, or even if the priors are only mutually absolutely\ncontinuous, since if this is the case then one can simply drop any\n\\(\\omega\\) with zero prior from consideration.\n\n\nProposition 3.11 (Aumann 1987)\n\nIf each agent \\(i \\in N\\) is \\(\\omega\\)-Bayes rational at each\npossible world \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\), then the agents are following an\nAumann correlated equilibrium. If the CPA is satisfied, then the\ncorrelated equilibrium is objective.\n\nProof.\n\n\nPart of the uncertainty the agents might have about their situation is\nwhether or not all agents are rational. But if it is assumed that all\nagents are \\(\\omega\\)-Bayesian rational at each \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\),\nthen a description of this fact forms part of the description of each\npossible \\(\\omega\\) and thus lies in the meet of the agents\u2019\npartitions. As noted already, descriptions of the agents\u2019\npriors, their partitions and the game also form part of the\ndescription of each possible world, so propositions corresponding to\nthese facts also lie in the meet of the agents\u2019 partitions. So\nanother way of stating Aumann\u2019s main result is as follows:\nCommon knowledge of \\(\\omega\\)-Bayesian rationality at\neach possible world implies that the agents follow an Aumann\ncorrelated equilibrium.\n\nPropositions 3.7 and 3.11 are powerful results. They say that common\nknowledge of rationality and of agents beliefs about each other,\nquantified as their probability distributions over the strategy\nprofiles they might follow, implies that the agents\u2019 beliefs\ncharacterize an equilibrium of the game. Then if the agents\u2019\nbeliefs are unconditional, Proposition 3.7 says that the agents are\nrational to follow a strategy profile consistent with the\ncorresponding endogenous correlated equilibrium. If their beliefs are\nconditional on their private information partitions, then Proposition\n3.11 says they are rational to follow the strategies the corresponding\nAumann correlated equilibrium recommends. However, we must not\noverestimate the importance of these results, for they say nothing\nabout the origins of the common knowledge of rationality and\nbeliefs. For instance, in the Chicken game of Figure 3.1, we\nconsidered an example of a correlated equilibrium in which it was\nassumed that Lizzi and Joanna had common knowledge of the\nsystem of recommended strategies defined by \\((\\star).\\) Given this\ncommon knowledge, Joanna and Lizzi indeed have decisive reason to\nfollow the Aumann correlated equilibrium f. But where did this common\nknowledge come from? How, in general, do agents come to have the\ncommon knowledge which justifies their conforming to an equilibrium?\nPhilosophers and social scientists have made only limited progress in\naddressing this question.\n3.4 Games of Perfect Information\n\nIn extensive form games, the agents move in sequence. At each stage,\nthe agent who is to move must base her decisions upon what she knows\nabout the preceding moves. This part of the agent\u2019s knowledge is\ncharacterized by an information set, which is the set of\nalternative moves that an agent knows her predecessor might have\nchosen. For instance, consider the extensive form game of Figure\n3.4:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4\n\n\nWhen Joanna moves she is at her information set \\(I^{22} = \\{C^1,\nD^1\\},\\) that is, she moves knowing that Lizzi might have chosen\neither \\(C^1\\) or \\(D^1\\), so this game is an extensive form\nrepresentation of the Chicken game of Figure 3.1.\n\nIn a game of perfect information, each information set consists of a\nsingle node in the game tree, since by definition at each state the\nagent who is to move knows exactly how her predecessors have moved. In\nExample 1.4 it was noted that the method of backwards induction can be\napplied to any game of perfect\n information.[30]\n The backwards induction solution is the unique Nash equilibrium of a\ngame of perfect information. The following result gives sufficient\nconditions to justify backwards induction play in a game of perfect\ninformation:\n\n\nProposition 3.12 (Bicchieri 1993)\n\nIn an extensive form game of perfect information, the agents follow\nthe backwards induction solution if the following conditions are\nsatisfied for each agent \\(i\\) at each information set \\(I^{ik}\\):\n\n\\(i\\) is rational, \\(i\\) knows this and \\(i\\) knows the game,\nand\nAt any information set \\(I^{jk + 1}\\) that immediately follows\n\\(I^{ik}, i\\) knows at \\(I^{ik}\\) what \\(j\\) knows at \\(I^{jk +\n1}\\).\n\nProof.\n \n\nProposition 3.12 says that far less than common knowledge of the game\nand of rationality suffices for the backwards induction solution to\nobtain in a game of perfect information. All that is needed is for\neach agent at each of her information sets to be rational, to know the\ngame and to know what the next agent to move knows! For instance, in\nthe Figure 1.2 game, if \\(R_1 (R_2)\\) stands for \u201cAlan (Fiona)\nis rational\u201d and \\(\\mathbf{K}_i (\\Gamma)\\) stands for\n\u201c\\(i\\) knows the game \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d, then the backwards\ninduction solution is implied by the following:\n\nAt \\(I^{24}, R_2\\) and \\(\\mathbf{K}_2 (\\Gamma)\\).\nAt \\(I^{13}, R_1, \\mathbf{K}_1 (\\Gamma), \\mathbf{K}_1 (R_2)\\), and\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2 (\\Gamma)\\).\nAt \\(I^{22}, \\mathbf{K}_2 (R_1), \\mathbf{K}_2\\mathbf{K}_1 (R_2)\\),\nand \\(\\mathbf{K}_2\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2 (\\Gamma)\\).\nAt \\(I ^{11}, \\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2 (R_1),\n\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2\\mathbf{K}_1 (R_2)\\), and\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2\n (\\Gamma)\\).[31]\n\n\nOne might think that a corollary to Proposition 3.11 is that in a game\nof perfect information, common knowledge of the game and of\nrationality implies the backwards induction solution. This is the\nclassical argument for the backwards induction solution. Many\ngame theorists continue to accept the classical argument, but in\nrecent years, the argument has come under strong challenge, led by the\nwork of Reny (1988, 1992), Binmore (1987) and Bicchieri (1989, 1993).\nThe basic idea underlying their criticisms of backwards induction can\nbe illustrated with the Figure 1.2 game. According to the classical\nargument, if Alan and Fiona have common knowledge of rationality and\nthe game, then each will predict that the other will follow her end of\nthe backwards induction solution, to which his end of the backwards\ninduction solution is his unique best response. However, what if Fiona\nreconsiders what to do if she finds herself at the information set\n\\(I^{22}\\)? If the information set \\(I^{22}\\) is reached, then Alan\nhas of course not followed the backwards induction solution. If we\nassume that at \\(I^{22}\\), Fiona knows only what is stated in (iii),\nthen she can explain her being at \\(I^{22}\\) as a failure of either\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2\\mathbf{K}_1 (R_2)\\) or\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2 (\\Gamma)\\) at\n\\(I^{11}\\). In this case, Fiona\u2019s thinking that either\n\\(\\neg\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2\\mathbf{K}_1 (R_2)\\) or\n\\(\\neg\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2(\\Gamma)\\) at\n\\(I^{11}\\) is compatible with what Alan in fact does know at\n\\(I^{11}\\), so Fiona should not necessarily be surprised to find\nherself at \\(I^{22}\\), and given that what she knows there is\ncharacterized by (iii), following the backwards induction solution is\nher best strategy. But if rationality and the game are common\nknowledge, or even if Fiona and Alan both have just have mutual\nknowledge of the statements characterized by (iii) and (iv), then at\n\\(I^{22}\\), Fiona knows that \\(\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2\\mathbf{K}_1\n(R_2)\\) or \\(\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2\\mathbf{K}_1\\mathbf{K}_2\n(\\Gamma)\\) at \\(I^{11}\\). Hence given this much mutual knowledge,\nFiona no longer can explain why Alan has deviated from the backwards\ninduction solution, since this deviation contradicts part of what is\ntheir mutual knowledge. So if she finds herself at \\(I^{22}\\), Fiona\ndoes not necessarily have good reason to think that Alan will follow\nthe backwards induction solution of the subgame beginning at\n\\(I^{22}\\), and hence she might not have good reason to follow the\nbackwards induction solution, either. Bicchieri (1993), who along with\nBinmore (1987) and Reny (1988, 1992) extends this argument to games of\nperfect information with arbitrary length, draws a startling\nconclusion: If agents have strictly too few or strictly too\nmany levels of mutual knowledge of rationality and the game\nrelative to the number of potential moves, one cannot predict that\nthey will follow the backwards induction solution. This would\nundermine the central role backwards induction has played in the\nanalysis of extensive form games. For why should the number of levels\nof mutual knowledge the agents have depend upon the length of the\ngame?\n\nThe classical argument for backwards induction implicitly assumes that\nat each stage of the game, the agents discount the preceding moves as\nstrategically irrelevant. Defenders of the classical argument can\nargue that this assumption makes sense, since by definition at any\nagents\u2019 decision node, the previous moves that led to this node\nare now fixed. Critics of the classical argument question this\nassumption, contending that when reasoning about how to move at any of\nhis information sets, including those not on the backwards\ninduction equilibrium path, part of what an agent must consider\nis what conditions might have led to his being at that information\nset. In other words, agents should incorporate reasoning about the\nreasoning of the previous movers, or forward induction\nreasoning, into their deliberations over how to move at a given\ninformation set. Binmore (1987) and Bicchieri (1993) contend that a\nbackwards induction solution to a game should be consistent with the\nsolution a corresponding forward induction argument recommends. As we\nhave seen, given common knowledge of the game and of rationality,\nforward induction reasoning can lead the agents to an apparent\ncontradiction: The classical argument for backwards induction is\npredicated on what agents predict they would do at nodes in the tree\nthat are never reached. They make these predictions based upon their\ncommon knowledge of the game and of rationality. But forward induction\nreasoning seems to imply that if any off-equilibrium node had been\nreached, common knowledge of rationality and the game must have\nfailed, so how could the agents have predicted what would happen at\nthese nodes?\n3.5 Communication Networks\n\nSituations in which a member of a population \\(P\\) is willing to\nengage in a certain course of action provided that a large enough\nportion of \\(P\\) engages in some appropriate behavior are typical\nproblems of collective action. Consider the case of an agent\nwho is debating whether to join a revolt. Her decision to join or not\nto join will depend on the number of other agents whom she expects to\njoin the revolt. If such a number is too low, she will prefer not to\nrevolt, while if the number is sufficiently large, she will prefer to\nrevolt. Michael Chwe proposes a model where such a situation is\nmodeled game-theoretically. Players\u2019 knowledge about other\nplayers\u2019 intentions depends on a social network in\nwhich players are located. The individual \u2018thresholds\u2019 for\neach player (the number of other agents that are needed for that\nspecific player to revolt) are only known by the immediate neighbors\nin the network. Besides the intrinsic value of the results obtained by\nChwe\u2019s analysis regarding the subject of collective action, his\nmodel also provides insights about both the relation between social\nnetworks and common knowledge and about the role of common knowledge\nin collective action. For example, in some situations, first-order\nknowledge of other agents\u2019 personal thresholds is not sufficient\nto motivate an agent to take action, whereas higher-order knowledge\nor, in the limit, common knowledge is.\n\nWe present Chwe\u2019s model following (Chwe 1999) and (Chwe 2000).\nSuppose there is a group \\(P\\) of \\(n\\) people, and each agent has two\nstrategies: \\(r\\) (revolt, that is participating in the collective\naction) and \\(s\\) (stay home and not participate). Each agent has her\nown individual threshold \\(\\theta \\in \\{1, 2,\\ldots, n+1\\}\\)\nand she prefers \\(r\\) over \\(s\\) if and only if the total number of\nplayers who revolt is greater than or equal to her threshold. An agent\nwith threshold 1 always revolts; an agent with threshold 2 revolts\nonly if another agent does; an agent with threshold \\(n\\) revolts only\nif all agents do; an agent with threshold \\(n+1\\) never revolts, etc.\nThe agents are located in a social network, represented by a binary\nrelation \\(\\rightarrow\\) over \\(P\\). The intended meaning of \\(i\n\\rightarrow j\\) is that agent \\(i\\) \u2018talks\u2019 to agent\n\\(j\\), that is to say, agent \\(i\\) knows the threshold of\nagent \\(j.\\) If we define \\(B(i)\\) to be the set \\(\\{j \\in P : j\n\\rightarrow i\\},\\) we can interpret \\(B(i)\\) as \\(i\\)\u2019s\n\u2018neighborhood\u2019 and say that, in general, \\(i\\) knows the\nthresholds of all agents in her neighborhood. A further assumption is\nthat, for all \\(j,k \\in B(i),\\) \\(i\\) knows whether \\(j \\rightarrow\nk\\) or not, that is, every agent knows whether her neighbors are\ncommunicating with each other. The relation \\(\\rightarrow\\) is taken\nto be reflexive (one knows her own threshold).\n\nPlayers\u2019 knowledge is represented as usual in a possible worlds\nframework. Consider for example the case in which there are two\nagents, both with one of thresholds 1, 2 or 3. There are nine possible\nworlds represented by ordered pairs of numbers, representing the first\nand second player\u2019s individual thresholds respectively: 11, 12,\n13,\u2026, 32, 33. If the players do not communicate, each knows her\nown threshold only. Player 1\u2019s information partition reflects\nher ignorance about player\u2019s 2 threshold and it consists of the\nsets \\(\\{11, 12, 13\\},\\) \\(\\{21, 22, 23\\},\\) \\(\\{31, 32, 33\\};\\)\nwhereas, similarly, player 2\u2019s partition consists of the sets\n\\(\\{11, 21, 31\\},\\) \\(\\{12, 22, 32\\},\\) \\(\\{13, 23, 33\\}.\\) If player\n1\u2019s threshold is 1, she revolts no matter what player 2\u2019s\nthreshold is. Hence, player 1 revolts in \\(\\{11, 12, 13\\}\\). If player\n1\u2019s threshold is 3, she never revolts. Hence, she plays \\(s\\) in\n\\(\\{31, 32, 33\\}\\). If her threshold is 2, she revolts only if the\nother player revolts as well. Since in this example we are assuming\nthat there is no communication between the agents, player 1 cannot be\nsure of player\u2019s 2 action, and chooses the non-risky \\(s\\) in\n\\(\\{21, 22, 23\\}\\) as well. Similarly, player 2 plays \\(r\\) in \\(\\{11,\n21, 31\\}\\) and \\(s\\) otherwise. Consider now the case in which \\(1\n\\rightarrow 2\\) and \\(2 \\rightarrow 1\\). Both players have now the\nfinest information partitions. Thresholds of 1 and 3 yield \\(r\\) and\n\\(s\\), respectively, for both players again. However, in player\n1\u2019s cells \\(\\{21\\}\\) and \\(\\{22\\}\\), she knows that player 2\nwill revolt, and, having threshold 2, she revolts as well. Similarly\nfor player 2 in his cells \\(\\{12\\}\\) and \\(\\{22\\}\\). Note, that the\ncase in which both players have threshold 2, yields both the\nequilibrium in which both players revolt and the equilibrium in which\neach player stays home. It is assumed that in the case of multiple\nequilibria, the one which results in the most revolt will obtain.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5\n\n\nThe analysis of the example above applies to general networks with\n\\(n\\) agents. Consider for example the three person network \\(1\n\\rightarrow 2, 2 \\rightarrow 1, 2 \\rightarrow 3\\), represented in\nfigure 3.5a (notice that symmetric links are represented by a line\nwithout arrowheads) and assume that each player has threshold 2. The\nnetwork between players 1 and 2 is the same as the one above, hence if\nthey have threshold 2, they both revolt regardless of the threshold of\nplayer 3. Player 3, on the other hand, knows her own threshold and\nplayer 2\u2019s. Hence, if they all have threshold 2, she cannot\ndistinguish between the possibilities in the set \\(\\{122, 222, 322,\n422\\}\\). At 422, in particular, neither player 1 nor player 2 revolt,\nhence player 3 cannot take the risk and does not revolt, even\nif, in fact, she has a neighbor who revolts. Adding the link \\(1\n\\rightarrow 3\\) to the network (cf. figure 3.5b) we provide player 3\nwith knowledge about player 1\u2019s action, hence in this case, if\nthey all have threshold 2, they all revolt. Notice that if we break\nthe link between players 1 and 2 (so that the network is \\(1\n\\rightarrow 3\\) and \\(2 \\rightarrow 3)\\), player 3 knows that 1 and 2\ncannot communicate and hence do not revolt at 222, therefore she\nchooses \\(s\\) as well. Knowledge of what other players know about\nother players is crucial.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6\n\n\nThe next example reveals that in some cases not even first-order\nknowledge is sufficient to trigger action, and higher levels of\nknowledge are necessary. Consider four players, each with threshold 3,\nin the two different networks represented in figure 3.6\n(\u2018square\u2019, in figure 3.6a, and \u2018kite\u2019, in\nfigure 3.6b.) In the square network, player 1 knows that both\n2 and 4 have threshold 3. However, she does not know about player\n3\u2019s threshold. If player 3 has threshold 5, then player 2 will\nnever revolt, since he does not know about player 4\u2019s threshold\nand it is then possible for him that player 4 has threshold 5 as well.\nPlayer 1\u2019s uncertainty about player 3 together with player\n1\u2019s knowledge of player 2\u2019s uncertainty about player 4\nforce her not to revolt, although she has threshold 3 and two\nneighbors with threshold 3 as well. Similar reasoning applies to all\nother players, hence in the square no one revolts. Consider now the\nkite network. Player 4 ignores player 1\u2019s and player\n2\u2019s thresholds, hence he does not revolt. However, player 1\nknows that players 2 and 3 have threshold 3, that they know that they\ndo, and that they know that player 1 knows that they do. This is\nenough to trigger action \\(r\\) for the three of them, and indeed if\nplayers 1, 2 and 3 all revolt in all states in \\(\\{3331, 3332, 3333,\n3334, 3335\\}\\), this is an equilibrium since in all states at least\nthree people revolt each with threshold three.\n\nThe difference between the square and the kite networks is that,\nalthough in the square enough agents are willing to revolt for a\nrevolt to actually take place, and they all individually know this, no\nagent knows that others know it. In the kite, on the other hand,\nagents in the triangle not only know that there are three agents with\nthreshold 3, but they also know that they all know it, know that they\nall know that they all know it, and so on. There is common knowledge\nof such fact among them. It is interesting to notice that in\nChwe\u2019s model, common knowledge obtains without there been a\npublicly known fact (cf. section 2.2). The proposition\n\u201cplayers 1, 2 and 3 all have threshold 3\u201d (semantically:\nthe event \\(\\{3331, 3332, 3333, 3334, 3335\\})\\) is known by players 1,\n2 and 3 because of the network structure, and becomes common knowledge\nbecause the network structure is known by the players. To be sure, the\nnetwork structure is not just simply known, but it is actually\ncommonly known by the players. Player 1, for example, does not only\nknow that players 2 and 3 communicate with each other. She also knows\nthat players 2 and 3 know that she knows that they communicate with\neach other, and so on.\n\nIn complete networks (networks in which all players\ncommunicate with everyone else, as within the triangle in the kite\nnetwork) the information partitions of the players coincide, and they\nare the finest partitions of the set of possible worlds. Hence, if\nplayers have sufficiently low thresholds, such fact is commonly known\nand there is an equilibrium in which all players revolt.\n\n\nDefinition 3.13\n\nWe say that \\(\\rightarrow\\) is a sufficient network if there\nis an equilibrium such that all players choose to revolt.\n\n\nFor a game in which all players have sufficiently low thresholds, the\ncomplete network is clearly sufficient. Is the complete network\nnecessary to obtain an equilibrium in which all players revolt? It\nturns out that it is not. A crucial role is played by structures of\nthe same kind as the \u2018triangle\u2019 group in the kite network,\ncalled cliques. In such structures, \u2018local\u2019\ncommon knowledge (that is, limited to the players part of the\nstructure) arises naturally. In a complete network (that is, a network\nin which there is sufficient but not superfluous communication for it\nto fully revolt) in which cliques cover the entire population, if one\nclique speaks to another then every member of that clique speaks to\nevery member of the other clique. Moreover, for every two cliques such\nthat one is talking to the other, there exists a \u2018chain\u2019\nof cliques with a starting element. In other words, every pair of\ncliques in the relation are part of a chain (of length at least 2)\nwith a starting element (a leading clique.) Revolt propagates\nin the network moving from \u2018leading adopters\u2019 to\n\u2018followers\u2019, according to the social role\nhierarchy defined by the cliques and their relation. Consider the\nfollowing example, in which cliques are represented by circles and\nnumbers represent the thresholds of individual players:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7\n\n\nHere the threshold 3 clique is the leading clique, igniting revolt in\nthe threshold 5 follower clique. In turn, the clique of a single\nthreshold 3 element follows. Notice that although she does not need to\nknow that the leading clique actually revolts to be willing to revolt,\nthat information is needed to ensure that the threshold 5 clique does\nrevolt, and hence that it is safe for her to join the revolt. While in\neach clique information about thresholds and hence willingness to\nrevolt is common knowledge, in a chain of cliques information is\n\u2018linear\u2019; each clique knows about the clique of which it\nis a follower, but does not know about earlier cliques.\n\nAnalyzing Chwe\u2019s models for collective action under the respect\nof weak versus strong links (cf. both Chwe 1999 and Chwe 2000)\nprovides further insights about the interaction between communication\nnetworks and common knowledge. A strong link, roughly speaking, joins\nclose friends, whereas a weak link joins acquaintances. Strong links\ntend to increase more slowly than weak ones, since people have common\nclose friends more often than they share acquaintances. In terms of\nspreading information and connecting society, then, weak links do a\nbetter job than strong links, since they traverse society more quickly\nand have therefore larger reach. What role do strong and weak links\nplay in collective action? In Chwe\u2019s dynamic analysis, strong\nlinks fare better when thresholds are low, whereas weak links are\nbetter when players\u2019 thresholds are higher. Intuitively, one\nsees that strong links tend to form small cliques right away (because\nof the symmetry intrinsic in them: my friends\u2019 friends tend to\nbe my friends as well); common knowledge arises quickly at the local\nlevel and, if thresholds are low, there is a better chance that a\ngroup tied by a strong link becomes a leading clique initiating\nrevolt. If, on the other hand, thresholds are high, local common\nknowledge in small cliques is fruitless, and weak links, reaching\nfurther distances more quickly, speed up communication and building of\nthe large cliques needed to sparkle collective action. Such\nconsiderations shed some light on the relation between social networks\nand common knowledge. While it is true that knowledge spreads faster\nin networks in which weak links predominate, higher-order knowledge\n(and, hence, common knowledge) tends to arise more slowly in this kind\nof networks. Networks with a larger number of strong links, on the\nother hand, facilitate the formation of common knowledge at the local\nlevel.\n",
