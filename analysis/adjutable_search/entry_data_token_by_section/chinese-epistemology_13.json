    "main_text": "Buddhist Influences and the Neo-Confucian Epistemology || The Structural Principle as the Leading Principle of Comprehension\n4.3 The Structural Principle as the Leading Principle of Comprehension\n\nFollowing the Chinese Middle Ages, the main Neo-Confucian ontological\nconcept of structural pattern or principle (li \u7406), as\nopposed to vital creativity (qi \u6c23), gradually evolved\ninto a new, crucial epistemological notion.\n\nIn the context of Neo-Confucian philosophy, things can generally be\nrecognized or understood through their basic structural principles.\nJust as dao in classical Daoist cosmogony represents the\nall-embracing fundamental law which manifests itself simultaneously\nwithin every single entity of being, the Neo-Confucian li\nexpresses itself on both, the level of cosmic unity, as well as on the\nlevel of its concrete manifestations. The nature of li is thus\nboth holistic and binary, transcendent and immanent. According to this\nnew aspect of being, knowledge can only be achieved by following these\nprinciples of the external world.\n\nAlthough dao as the elementary metaphysical force is abstract\nand therefore cannot be apprehended directly, it can, in Neo-Confucian\nthought be recognized through both intuition and reason. The\nepistemological role of the concept li becomes even more\nsalient, for li was developed not only as the structural\nprinciple that defines the concrete state of being of everything that\nexists, but also as the leading structural principle of human reason\n(see\n section 1.2).\n\nAfter distinguishing between subjective and objective knowledge, Shao\nYong warns against subjectivity, which is a consequence of our\ninability to recognize or understand structural principles underlying\nreality, making him one of the first philosophers to apply the term\nli in the Neo-Confucian sense. In this relatively new\ncontext, he often applied the term wu li \u7269\u7406\n(lit.: structural patterns or principles of things), which would, in\nmodern Chinese, serve as the translation of the Western word physics\n(in the sense of physical science). Given his approach, it comes as no\nsurprise to find him stressing the distinction between\n\u201ctrue\u201d recognition and false mysticisms. Zhu Xi also\nadvocated comprehension in accordance with the principle li\n(Zhu 1999: 8, 25). Like Shao Yong, he was convinced that li\nwas not only the structural principle that governs the existence\nof all external things, but also a necessary and inseparable part of\nthe human heart-mind (Zhu 1999: 60, 6, 7). However, in Zhu Xi\u2019s\nview the spiritual functions of li did not refer only to\nhuman reason, but also represented the human ability to perceive and\ncomprehend the external world (Zhu 1999: 47). Following the priority\nof moral principles within Confucian (and Neo-Confucian)\nepistemologies, as the central and universal principle, Zhu Xi\u2019s\nli also naturally incorporated ethical components (Zhu 1999:\n8, 20).\n",
