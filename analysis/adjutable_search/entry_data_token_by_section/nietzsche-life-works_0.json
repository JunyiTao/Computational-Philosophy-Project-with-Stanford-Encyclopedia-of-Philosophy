Life: 1844\u20131900\n\nIn the small German village of R\u00f6cken bei L\u00fctzen, located in\na rural farmland area about 20 miles southwest of Leipzig, Friedrich\nWilhelm Nietzsche was born at approximately 10:00 a.m. on October 15,\n1844. The date coincided with the 49th birthday of the Prussian King,\nFriedrich Wilhelm IV, after whom Nietzsche was named, and who had been\nresponsible for Nietzsche\u2019s father\u2019s appointment as\nR\u00f6cken\u2019s town pastor.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s uncle and grandfathers were also Lutheran ministers,\nand his paternal grandfather, Friedrich August Ludwig Nietzsche\n(1756\u20131826), was further distinguished as a Protestant scholar,\none of whose books (1796) affirmed the \u201ceverlasting survival of\nChristianity.\u201d Nietzsche\u2019s grandparents on both sides were\nfrom the Province of Saxony, with his paternal grandfather, paternal\ngrandmother (Erdmuthe Dorothea Krause, 1778\u20131856), maternal\ngrandfather (David Ernst Ohler, 1787\u20131859) and maternal\ngrandmother (Johanna Elisabeth Wilhelmine Hahn, 1794\u20131876)\nhaving been born respectively in the small towns of Bibra (just south\nof Jena), Reichenbach (southeast of Jena), Zeitz (between Jena and\nLeipzig), and Wehlitz (just northwest of Leipzig).\n\nWhen Nietzsche was nearly 5 years old, his father, Karl Ludwig\nNietzsche (1813\u20131849) died from a brain ailment (July 30, 1849)\nand the death of Nietzsche\u2019s two-year-old brother, Ludwig\nJoseph, followed traumatically six months later (January 4, 1850).\nHaving been living only yards away from R\u00f6cken\u2019s church in\nthe house reserved for the pastor and his family, the Nietzsche family\nleft their home soon after Karl Ludwig\u2019s death. They moved to\nnearby Naumburg an der Saale, where Nietzsche (called\n\u201cFritz\u201d by his family) lived with his mother, Franziska\n(1826\u20131897), his grandmother, Erdmuthe, his father\u2019s two\nsisters, Auguste and Rosalie (d. 1855 and 1867, respectively), and his\nyounger sister, Therese Elisabeth Alexandra (1846\u20131935).\n\nFrom the ages of 14 to 19 (1858\u20131864), Nietzsche attended a\nfirst-rate boarding school, Schulpforta, located about 4km from his\nhome in Naumburg, where he prepared for university studies. The\nschool\u2019s rigid educational atmosphere was reflected in its long\nhistory as a former Cistercian monastery (1137\u20131540), with\nbuildings that included a 12th century Romanesque chapel and a 13th\ncentury Gothic church. At Schulpforta\u2014a school whose alumni\nincluded the German Idealist philosopher, Johann Gottlieb Fichte\n(1762\u20131814) and the philologist, Ulrich von\nWilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff (1848\u20131931)\u2014Nietzsche met his\nlifelong friend, Paul Deussen (1845\u20131919), who was confirmed at\nNietzsche\u2019s side in 1861, and who was to become an Orientalist,\nhistorian of philosophy, and in 1911, the founder of the Schopenhauer\nSociety. During his summers in Naumburg, Nietzsche led a small music\nand literature club named \u201cGermania,\u201d and became\nacquainted with Richard Wagner\u2019s music through the club\u2019s\nsubscription to the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik. The teenage\nNietzsche also read the German romantic writings of Friedrich\nH\u00f6lderlin and Jean-Paul Richter, along with David Strauss\u2019s\ncontroversial and demythologizing Life of Jesus Critically\nExamined (Das Leben Jesu kritisch bearbeitet, 1848).\n\nAfter graduating from Schulpforta, Nietzsche entered the University of\nBonn in 1864 as a theology and philology student, and his interests\nsoon gravitated more exclusively towards philology\u2014a discipline\nwhich then centered upon the interpretation of classical and biblical\ntexts. As a student of philology, Nietzsche attended lectures by Otto\nJahn (1813\u20131869) and Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl\n(1806\u20131876). Jahn was a biographer of Mozart who had studied at\nthe University of Berlin under Karl Lachmann (1793\u20131851)\u2014a\nphilologist known both for his studies of the Roman philosopher,\nLucretius (ca. 99\u201355 BCE), and for having developed the\ngenealogical, or stemmatic, method in textual recension; Ritschl was a\nclassics scholar whose work centered on the Roman comic poet, Plautus\n(254\u2013184 BCE).\n\nInspired by Ritschl, and following him to the University of Leipzig in\n1865\u2014an institution located closer to Nietzsche\u2019s hometown\nof Naumburg\u2014Nietzsche quickly established his own academic\nreputation through his published essays on two 6th century BCE poets,\nTheognis and Simonides, as well as on Aristotle. In Leipzig, he\ndeveloped a close friendship with Erwin Rohde (1845\u20131898), a\nfellow philology student and future philologist, with whom he would\ncorrespond extensively in later years. Momentous for Nietzsche in 1865\nwas his accidental discovery of Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s The\nWorld as Will and Representation (1818) in a local bookstore. He\nwas then 21. Schopenhauer\u2019s atheistic and turbulent vision of\nthe world, in conjunction with his high praise of music as an art form\ncaptured Nietzsche\u2019s imagination, and to this day, the extent to\nwhich the \u201ccadaverous perfume\u201d of Schopenhauer\u2019s\nworld-view continued to permeate Nietzsche\u2019s mature thought\nremains a matter of scholarly debate. After discovering Schopenhauer,\nNietzsche read F.A. Lange\u2019s newly-published History of\nMaterialism and Critique of its Present Significance\n(1866)\u2014a work that criticizes materialist theories from the\nstandpoint of Kant\u2019s critique of metaphysics, and that attracted\nNietzsche\u2019s interest for its view that metaphysical speculation\nis an expression of poetic illusion.\n\nIn 1867, as he approached the age of 23, Nietzsche entered his\nrequired military service and was assigned to an equestrian field\nartillery regiment close to Naumburg, during which time he lived at\nhome with his mother. While attempting to leap-mount into the saddle,\nhe suffered a serious chest injury and was put on sick leave after his\nchest wound refused to heal. He returned shortly thereafter to the\nUniversity of Leipzig, and in November of 1868, met the composer\nRichard Wagner (1813\u20131883) at the home of Hermann Brockhaus\n(1806\u20131877), an Orientalist who was married to Wagner\u2019s\nsister, Ottilie. Brockhaus was himself a specialist in Sanskrit and\nPersian whose publications included (1850) an edition of the\nVendidad Sade\u2014a text of the Zoroastrian religion, whose\nprophet was Zarathustra (Zoroaster).\n\nWagner and Nietzsche shared an enthusiasm for Schopenhauer, and\nNietzsche\u2014who had been composing piano, choral and orchestral\nmusic since he was a teenager\u2014admired Wagner for his musical\ngenius, magnetic personality and cultural influence. Wagner was the\nsame age Nietzsche\u2019s father would have been, and he had also\nattended the University of Leipzig many years before. The\nNietzsche-Wagner relationship was quasi-familial and sometimes-stormy,\nand it affected Nietzsche deeply. Early on, he could write (in 1869)\nthat his friendship with Wagner was the \u201cgreatest\nachievement\u201d [die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Errungenschaft] of\nhis life, and he was still energetically engaged in appraising and\npondering Wagner\u2019s cultural significance twenty years later at\nthe end of his writing life. But Nietzsche broke with Wagner\npersonally and intellectually in the late 1870s, and his assessments\nbecame increasingly negative (and more and more explicit) as time went\non. Nevertheless, even after their break, Nietzsche was still\nreminiscing wistfully in 1882 about how his days with Wagner had been\nthe best of his life. During the months surrounding Nietzsche\u2019s\ninitial meeting with Wagner, Ritschl recommended Nietzsche for a\nposition on the classical philology faculty at the University of\nBasel. The Swiss university offered Nietzsche the professorial\nposition, and he began teaching there in May, 1869, at the age of 24.\n\n\nAt Basel, Nietzsche\u2019s satisfaction with his life among his\nphilology colleagues was limited, and he established closer\nintellectual ties to the historians Franz Overbeck (1837\u20131905)\nand Jacob Burkhardt (1818\u20131897), whose lectures he attended.\nOverbeck\u2014who roomed for five years in the same house as\nNietzsche\u2014became Nietzsche\u2019s close and enduring friend,\nexchanging many letters with him over the years, and rushing to\nNietzsche\u2019s assistance in Turin immediately after his\ndevastating collapse in 1889. Nietzsche also cultivated his friendship\nwith Richard Wagner and visited him often at his Swiss home in\nTribschen, a small town near Lucerne. Never in outstanding health,\nfurther complications arose from Nietzsche\u2019s August-October 1870\nservice as a 25-year-old hospital attendant during the Franco-Prussian\nWar (1870\u201371), where he participated in the siege of Metz. He\nwitnessed the traumatic effects of battle, took close care of wounded\nsoldiers, and contracted diphtheria and dysentery.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s enthusiasm for Schopenhauer, his studies in\nclassical philology, his inspiration from Wagner, his reading of\nLange, his interests in health, his professional need to prove himself\nas a young academic, and his frustration with the contemporary German\nculture, all coalesced in his first book\u2014The Birth of\nTragedy (1872)\u2014which was published in January 1872 when\nNietzsche was 27. Wagner showered the book with praise, but a\nvitriolic, painfully-memorable and yet authoritative critical reaction\nby Ulrich von Wilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff\u2014who later became one\nof Germany\u2019s leading philologists\u2014immediately dampened the\nbook\u2019s reception, not to mention Nietzsche\u2019s class\nenrollments in Basel.\n\nWilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff came from an aristocratic family of\ndistant Polish descent and knew Nietzsche as a student at Schulpforta.\nIn his critique, he referred to Nietzsche as a disgrace to\nSchulpforta, and said that in light of the latter\u2019s prophetic,\nsoothsaying, exaggerated and historically uninformed style of writing,\nNietzsche should instead \u201cgather tigers and panthers about his\nknees, but not the youth of Germany.\u201d It is intriguing that in\nThus Spoke Zarathustra, written thirteen years later,\nNietzsche invokes the comparable imagery of a lion nuzzling warmly at\nthe knees of Zarathustra in the book\u2019s concluding and\ninspirational scene, as if to acknowledge that his proper audience is,\nindeed, not a set of university professors.\n\nAs Nietzsche continued his residence in Switzerland between 1872 and\n1879, he often visited Wagner at his new (1872) home in Bayreuth,\nGermany. In 1873, he met Paul R\u00e9e (1849\u20131901), who, while\nliving in close company with Nietzsche in Sorrento during the autumn\nof 1876, would write On the Origin of Moral Feelings (1877).\nDuring this time, Nietzsche completed a series of four studies on\ncontemporary German culture\u2014the Unfashionable\nObservations (1873\u201376)\u2014which focus respectively upon\n(1) the historian of religion and culture critic, David Strauss, (2)\nissues concerning the social value of historiography, (3) Arthur\nSchopenhauer and (4) Richard Wagner, both as heroic inspirations for\nnew cultural standards.\n\nNear the end of his university career, Nietzsche completed Human,\nAll-Too-Human (1878)\u2014a book that marks a turning point in\nhis philosophical style and that, while reinforcing his friendship\nwith R\u00e9e, also ends his friendship with the anti-Semitic\nWagner, who comes under attack in a thinly-disguised characterization\nof \u201cthe artist.\u201d Despite the damage done by the\nunflattering review of The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche\nremained respected in his professorial position in Basel, but his\ndeteriorating health, which led to migraine headaches, eyesight\nproblems and vomiting, necessitated his resignation from the\nuniversity in June, 1879, at age 34. At this point, he had been a\nuniversity professor for ten years, and had just less than another ten\nyears of productive intellectual life remaining.\n\nFrom 1880 until his collapse in January 1889, Nietzsche led a\nwandering, Roma-like existence as a stateless person (having given up\nhis German citizenship, and not having acquired Swiss citizenship),\ncircling almost annually between his mother\u2019s house in Naumburg\nand various French, Swiss, German and Italian cities. His travels took\nhim through the Mediterranean seaside city of Nice (during the\nwinters), the Swiss alpine village of Sils-Maria (during the summers,\nlocated near the present-day ski resort of St. Moritz), Leipzig (where\nhe had attended university, and had been hoping to resume his teaching\ncareer in 1883), Turin, Genoa, Recoaro, Messina, Rapallo, Florence,\nVenice, and Rome, never residing in any place longer than several\nmonths at a time.\n\nOn a visit to Rome in 1882, Nietzsche, now at age thirty-seven, met\nLou von Salom\u00e9 (1861\u20131937), a 21 year old Russian woman\nwho was studying philosophy and theology in Zurich. They had an active\nintellectual relationship and Nietzsche appears to have fallen in love\nwith her. Their relationship did not develop on a romantic level, and\ntheir friendship took a turn for the worse when Salom\u00e9 and Paul\nR\u00e9e left Nietzsche and moved to Berlin. In the years to follow,\nSalom\u00e9 would write a book about Nietzsche (Friedrich\nNietzsche in seinen Werken [Friedrich Nietzsche in his Works]) in\n1894, and would later become an associate of Sigmund Freud, who she\nmet in 1911. Salom\u00e9\u2019s insightful book on Nietzsche is one\nof the first to propose the division of Nietzsche\u2019s writings\ninto early, middle, and late periods.\n\nThese nomadic years were the occasion of Nietzsche\u2019s main works,\namong which are Daybreak (1881), The Gay Science\n(1882/1887), Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883\u201385),\nBeyond Good and Evil (1886), and On the Genealogy of\nMorals (1887). Nietzsche\u2019s final active year, 1888, saw the\ncompletion of The Case of Wagner (May-August 1888),\nTwilight of the Idols (August-September 1888), The\nAntichrist (September 1888), Ecce Homo (October-November\n1888) and Nietzsche Contra Wagner (December 1888).\n\nOn the morning of January 3, 1889, while in Turin, Nietzsche\nexperienced a mental breakdown which left him an invalid for the rest\nof his life. Coincidentally, on virtually the same date, viz., January\n4, his little brother, Joseph, had died many years before. Nietzsche,\nupon witnessing a horse being whipped by a coachman at the Piazza\nCarlo Alberto\u2014although this episode with the horse could be\nanecdotal\u2014threw his arms around the horse\u2019s neck and\ncollapsed in the plaza, never to return to full sanity.\n\nSome argue that Nietzsche was afflicted with a syphilitic infection\n(this was the original diagnosis of the doctors in Basel and Jena)\ncontracted either while he was a student or while he was serving as a\nhospital attendant during the Franco-Prussian War; some claim that his\nuse of chloral hydrate, a drug which he had been using as a sedative,\nundermined his already-weakened nervous system; some speculate that\nNietzsche\u2019s collapse was due to a brain disease he inherited\nfrom his father; some maintain that a mental illness gradually drove\nhim insane; some maintain that he suffered from a slow-growing,\nfrontal cranial base tumor; some maintain that he suffered from\nCADASIL syndrome, a hereditary stroke disorder; some maintain that\nNietzsche suffered from a tumor on the surface of the brain growing\nbehind his right eye. The exact cause of Nietzsche\u2019s\nincapacitation remains unclear. That he had an extraordinarily\nsensitive nervous constitution and took an assortment of medications\nis well-documented as a more general fact. To complicate matters of\ninterpretation, Nietzsche states in a letter from April 1888 that he\nnever had any symptoms of a mental disorder.\n\nDuring his creative years, Nietzsche struggled to bring his writings\ninto print and never doubted that his books would have a lasting\ncultural effect. He did not live long enough to experience his\nworld-historical influence, but he had a brief glimpse of his growing\nintellectual importance in discovering that he was the subject of 1888\nlectures given by Georg Brandes (Georg Morris Cohen) at the University\nof Copenhagen, to whom he directed the above April 1888\ncorrespondence, and from whom he received a recommendation to read\nKierkegaard\u2019s works. Nietzsche\u2019s collapse, however,\nfollowed soon thereafter.\n\nAfter a brief hospitalization in Basel, he spent 1889 in a sanatorium\nin Jena at the Binswanger Clinic, and in March 1890 his mother took\nhim back home to Naumburg, where he lived under her care for the next\nseven years in the house he knew as a youngster. After his\nmother\u2019s death in 1897, his sister Elisabeth\u2014having\nreturned home from Paraguay in 1893, where she had been working since\n1886 with her husband Bernhard F\u00f6rster to establish an Aryan,\nanti-Semitic German colony called \u201cNew Germany\u201d\n(\u201cNueva Germania\u201d)\u2014assumed responsibility for\nNietzsche\u2019s welfare. In an effort to promote her brother\u2019s\nphilosophy, she rented the \u201cVilla Silberblick,\u201d a large\nhouse in Weimar, and moved both Nietzsche and his collected\nmanuscripts to the residence. This became the new home of the\nNietzsche Archives (which had been located at the family home for the\nthree years preceding), where Elisabeth received visitors who wanted\nto observe the now-incapacitated philosopher.\n\nOn August 25, 1900, Nietzsche died in the villa as he approached his\n56th year, apparently of pneumonia in combination with a stroke. His\nbody was then transported to the family gravesite directly beside the\nchurch in R\u00f6cken bei L\u00fctzen, where his mother and sister now\nalso rest. The Villa Silberblick was eventually turned into a museum,\nand since 1950, Nietzsche\u2019s manuscripts have been located in\nWeimar at the Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv\n",
