    "main_text": "\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 (980\u20131037)\u2014the Avicenna of Latin\nfame\u2014is arguably the most important representative of\nfalsafa, the Graeco-Arabic philosophical tradition beginning\nwith Plato and Aristotle, extending through the Neoplatonic commentary\ntradition and continuing among philosophers and scientists in the\nmedieval Arabic world. Avicenna\u2019s fame in many ways is a result\nof his ability to synthesize and to extend the many intellectual\ntrends of his time. These trends included not only the aforementioned\nGreek traditions, but also the Islamic theological tradition,\nKal\u0101m, which was emerging at the same time that the Greek\nscientific and philosophical texts were being translated into Arabic.\nAvicenna\u2019s own unique system survives in no fewer than three\nphilosophical encyclopedias\u2014Cure (or The\nHealing), The Salvation and Pointers and\nReminders. Each provides a comprehensive worldview ranging from\nlogic to psychology, from metaphysics to ethics (although admittedly,\nethics is treated only scantly). At the middle of this Avicennan\nworldview is natural philosophy or physics (\u02bfilm\n\u1e6dab\u012b\u02bf\u012b). The significance of natural\nphilosophy, and Avicenna\u2019s physics in particular, is twofold.\nFirst, it represents Avicenna\u2019s best attempt to explain the\nsensible world in which we live and to provide the principles for many\nof the other special sciences. Second, Avicenna\u2019s natural\nphilosophy lays the foundations for a full understanding of his\nadvancements in other fields. Examples of this second point include,\nbut are certainly not limited to, the ramifications of logical\ndistinctions for the sciences, the physical basis of psychology (as\nwell as the limitation of physicalism for a philosophy of mind) and\nthe introduction of key problems that would become the focal points of\nmetaphysical inquiry. In all cases, Avicenna assumes his readers know\ntheir physics.\n\nAs others before him, Avicenna understands natural philosophy as the\nstudy of body insofar as it is subject to motion. Thus the present\nentry, after an overview of medieval physics generally, turns to\nAvicenna\u2019s account of the nature of body followed by his account\nof motion. Central to an account of bodies is whether they are\ncontinuous or atomic, and so one must consider Avicenna\u2019s\ncritique of atomism and his defense and analysis of continuous\nmagnitudes. The discussion of motion follows in two steps: one, his\naccount of motion and, two, his account of the conditions for motion.\nThe section on motion concentrates on Avicenna\u2019s unique\nunderstanding of the Aristotelian definition of motion as the first\nactuality of potential as potential, while the conditions for motion\ninvolve his understanding of time and place.\n",
