    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion\n6. Reception\n\nHobbes was a widely read and controversial author. In many cases, the\ndiscussion of his philosophy was about his political philosophy\n(Goldie 1994, Malcolm 2002). However, Hobbes\u2019s non-political\nviews were also discussed. The Cambridge Platonist Ralph Cudworth, for\nexample, devoted considerable energy to arguing against Hobbesian\natheism and materialism. Cudworth\u2019s Cambridge colleague Henry\nMore was also a critic of Hobbes. Margaret Cavendish, meanwhile,\nreacted to Hobbes\u2019s work and developed her own non-Hobbesian\nmaterialism. \n\nOne important connection is that between Hobbes\u2019s work and\nLeibniz\u2019s. Of all the canonical philosophers in the period from\nDescartes to Kant, Leibniz is probably the one who paid most attention\nto Hobbes\u2019s work, and had the most to say about different\naspects of it. Leibniz found Hobbes\u2019s work worthy of serious\nengagement, but ultimately also thought it mistaken in many ways. On\nthe other hand, later empiricist philosophers, in particular Locke and\nHume, develop several Hobbesian themes. Indeed, one might well speak\nof Hobbes, not Locke, as the first of the British empiricists.\n\nThe best known parts of Leibniz\u2019s interaction with Hobbes are\nfrom early in Leibniz\u2019s philosophical career, before 1686, the\nyear in which Leibniz wrote his \u2018Discourse on Metaphysics\u2019\n(Bernstein 1980; Jesseph 1998; Moll 1996, 103\u201336; Wilson 1997).\nHis criticism of Hobbes\u2019s nominalism, and his early adoption of\nthe view that reasoning is computation, were both discussed above.\nLeibniz also paid a good deal of attention to Hobbes\u2019s views\nabout motion, in particular those about conatus or endeavour,\nwhich have application both to physics and to mathematics. And Leibniz\ntwice in the 1670s wrote letters to Hobbes, though it is unclear if\nHobbes ever received them, and there is no evidence of any replies.\nLeibniz continued, moreover, to engage with Hobbes\u2019s work\nthroughout his philosophical career, even if that engagement was never\nquite as intense as it was in a brief early period. There is, for\ninstance, a discussion of Hobbes\u2019s views in the 1709\nTheodicy.\n\nLooking beyond Leibniz, we can see some close connections between the\nwork of Hobbes and that of Locke and Hume, both of whom were well\naware of Hobbes\u2019s views. Locke\u2019s connections to Hobbes,\nthough perhaps not obvious, are there (Rogers 1988). Think of\nLocke\u2019s empiricism (i.e., anti-nativism), his attention to\nlanguage and its workings and related errors, his granting at least\nthe possibility of materialism being true, and his scepticism about\nrevelation. Hume, meanwhile, begins his Treatise with his\nview about ideas being less intense copies of our sensations, a view\nwith a close resemblance to Hobbes\u2019s view about decaying sense.\nRussell (1985; 2008) argues convincingly that Hume modelled the\nstructure of the Treatise on that of Hobbes\u2019s\nElements of Law. And Hume, like Hobbes, combines apparent\nacceptance of a basic cosmological argument with scepticism about many\nreligious claims. Indeed there are enough connections that it\u2019s\nplausible to speak of \u201cthe empiricism of Hobbes\u2026,\nLocke\u2026, and Hume\u201d (Nidditch 1975, viii), rather than of\nthe more conventional trio of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume.\n",
