    "main_text": "What Exactly is AI?\n2. What Exactly is AI?\n\nSo far we have been proceeding as if we have a firm and precise grasp\nof the nature of AI. But what exactly is AI? Philosophers\narguably know better than anyone that precisely defining a particular\ndiscipline to the satisfaction of all relevant parties (including\nthose working in the discipline itself) can be acutely challenging.\nPhilosophers of science certainly have proposed credible accounts of\nwhat constitutes at least the general shape and texture of a given\nfield of science and/or engineering, but what exactly is the\nagreed-upon definition of physics? What about biology? What, for that\nmatter, is philosophy, exactly? These are remarkably difficult, maybe\neven eternally unanswerable, questions, especially if the target is a\nconsensus definition. Perhaps the most prudent course we can\nmanage here under obvious space constraints is to present in\nencapsulated form some proposed definitions of AI. We do\ninclude a glimpse of recent attempts to define AI in detailed,\nrigorous fashion (and we suspect that such attempts will be of\ninterest to philosophers of science, and those interested in this\nsub-area of philosophy). \n\nRussell and Norvig (1995, 2002, 2009), in their aforementioned\nAIMA text, provide a set of possible answers to the \u201cWhat\nis AI?\u201d question that has considerable currency in the field\nitself. These answers all assume that AI should be defined in terms of\nits goals: a candidate definition thus has the form \u201cAI is the\nfield that aims at building \u2026\u201d The answers all fall under\na quartet of types placed along two dimensions. One dimension is\nwhether the goal is to match human performance, or, instead, ideal\nrationality. The other dimension is whether the goal is to build\nsystems that reason/think, or rather systems that act. The situation\nis summed up in this table:\n\n\n\n\nHuman-Based\nIdeal Rationality \n\nReasoning-Based:\n Systems that think like humans. \n Systems that think rationally. \n\nBehavior-Based:\n Systems that act like humans. \n Systems that act rationally. \n\n\nFour Possible Goals for AI According to AIMA \n\n\nPlease note that this quartet of possibilities does reflect (at least\na significant portion of) the relevant literature. For example,\nphilosopher John Haugeland (1985) falls into the Human/Reasoning\nquadrant when he says that AI is \u201cThe exciting new effort to\nmake computers think \u2026 machines with minds, in the\nfull and literal sense.\u201d (By far, this is the quadrant that most\npopular narratives affirm and explore. The recent\n Westworld\n TV series is a powerful case in point.) Luger and Stubblefield (1993)\nseem to fall into the Ideal/Act quadrant when they write: \u201cThe\nbranch of computer science that is concerned with the automation of\nintelligent behavior.\u201d The Human/Act position is occupied most\nprominently by Turing, whose test is passed only by those systems able\nto act sufficiently like a human. The \u201cthinking\nrationally\u201d position is defended (e.g.) by Winston (1992). While\nit might not be entirely uncontroversial to assert that the four bins\ngiven here are exhaustive, such an assertion appears to be quite\nplausible, even when the literature up to the present moment is\ncanvassed. \n\nIt\u2019s important to know that the contrast between the focus on\nsystems that think/reason versus systems that act, while found, as we\nhave seen, at the heart of the AIMA texts, and at the heart of\nAI itself, should not be interpreted as implying that AI researchers\nview their work as falling all and only within one of these two\ncompartments. Researchers who focus more or less exclusively on\nknowledge representation and reasoning, are also quite prepared to\nacknowledge that they are working on (what they take to be) a central\ncomponent or capability within any one of a family of larger systems\nspanning the reason/act distinction. The clearest case may come from\nthe work on planning \u2013 an AI area traditionally making central\nuse of representation and reasoning. For good or ill, much of this\nresearch is done in abstraction (in vitro, as opposed to in vivo), but\nthe researchers involved certainly intend or at least hope that the\nresults of their work can be embedded into systems that actually do\nthings, such as, for example, execute the plans. \n\nWhat about Russell and Norvig themselves? What is their answer to the\nWhat is AI? question? They are firmly in the the \u201cacting\nrationally\u201d camp. In fact, it\u2019s safe to say both that they\nare the chief proponents of this answer, and that they have been\nremarkably successful evangelists. Their extremely influential\nAIMA series can be viewed as a book-length defense and\nspecification of the Ideal/Act category. We will look a bit later at\nhow Russell and Norvig lay out all of AI in terms of intelligent\nagents, which are systems that act in accordance with various\nideal standards for rationality. But first let\u2019s look a bit\ncloser at the view of intelligence underlying the AIMA text. We\ncan do so by turning to Russell (1997). Here Russell recasts the\n\u201cWhat is AI?\u201d question as the question \u201cWhat is\nintelligence?\u201d (presumably under the assumption that we have a\ngood grasp of what an artifact is), and then he identifies\nintelligence with rationality. More specifically, Russell sees\nAI as the field devoted to building intelligent agents, which\nare functions taking as input tuples of percepts from the external\nenvironment, and producing behavior (actions) on the basis of these\npercepts. Russell\u2019s overall picture is this one:\n\n\n\nThe Basic Picture Underlying Russell\u2019s Account of\nIntelligence/Rationality \n\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this diagram a bit, and take a look, first, at the\naccount of perfect rationality that can be derived from it. The\nbehavior of the agent in the environment \\(E\\) (from a class \\(\\bE\\)\nof environments) produces a sequence of states or snapshots of that\nenvironment. A performance measure \\(U\\) evaluates this sequence;\nnotice the box labeled \u201cPerformance Measure\u201d in the above\nfigure. We let \\(V(f,\\bE,U)\\) denote the expected utility\naccording to \\(U\\) of the agent function \\(f\\) operating on\n \\(\\bE\\).[16]\n Now we identify a perfectly rational agent with the agent function:\n \n\n\\[\\tag{1}\\label{eq1}\nf_{\\opt} = \\argmax_f V(f,\\bE,U)\n\\]\n\n\nAccording to the above equation, a perfectly rational agent can be\ntaken to be the function \\(f_{opt}\\) which produces the maximum\nexpected utility in the environment under consideration. Of course, as\nRussell points out, it\u2019s usually not possible to actually build\nperfectly rational agents. For example, though it\u2019s easy enough\nto specify an algorithm for playing invincible chess, it\u2019s not\nfeasible to implement this algorithm. What traditionally happens in AI\nis that programs that are \u2013 to use Russell\u2019s apt\nterminology \u2013 calculatively rational are constructed\ninstead: these are programs that, if executed infinitely fast,\nwould result in perfectly rational behavior. In the case of chess,\nthis would mean that we strive to write a program that runs an\nalgorithm capable, in principle, of finding a flawless move, but we\nadd features that truncate the search for this move in order to play\nwithin intervals of digestible duration. \n\nRussell himself champions a new brand of intelligence/rationality for\nAI; he calls this brand bounded optimality. To understand\nRussell\u2019s view, first we follow him in introducing a\ndistinction: We say that agents have two components: a program, and a\nmachine upon which the program runs. We write \\(Agent(P, M)\\) to\ndenote the agent function implemented by program \\(P\\) running on\nmachine \\(M\\). Now, let \\(\\mathcal{P}(M)\\) denote the set of all\nprograms \\(P\\) that can run on machine \\(M\\). The bounded\noptimal program \\(P_{\\opt,M}\\) then is: \n\n\\[\nP_{\\opt,M}=\\argmax_{P\\in\\mathcal{P}(M)}V(\\mathit{Agent}(P,M),\\bE,U)\n\\]\n\n\nYou can understand this equation in terms of any of the mathematical\nidealizations for standard computation. For example, machines can be\nidentified with Turing machines minus instructions (i.e., TMs are here\nviewed architecturally only: as having tapes divided into squares upon\nwhich symbols can be written, read/write heads capable of moving up\nand down the tape to write and erase, and control units which are in\none of a finite number of states at any time), and programs can be\nidentified with instructions in the Turing-machine model (telling the\nmachine to write and erase symbols, depending upon what state the\nmachine is in). So, if you are told that you must\n\u201cprogram\u201d within the constraints of a 22-state Turing\nmachine, you could search for the \u201cbest\u201d program given\nthose constraints. In other words, you could strive to find the\noptimal program within the bounds of the 22-state architecture.\nRussell\u2019s (1997) view is thus that AI is the field devoted to\ncreating optimal programs for intelligent agents, under time and space\nconstraints on the machines implementing these\n programs.[17]\n\n\nThe reader must have noticed that in the equation for \\(P_{\\opt,M}\\)\nwe have not elaborated on \\(\\bE\\) and \\(U\\) and how equation\n\\eqref{eq1} might be used to construct an agent if the class of\nenvironments \\(\\bE\\) is quite general, or if the true environment\n\\(E\\) is simply unknown. Depending on the task for which one is\nconstructing an artificial agent, \\(E\\) and \\(U\\) would vary. The\nmathematical form of the environment \\(E\\) and the utility function\n\\(U\\) would vary wildly from, say, chess to Jeopardy!. Of\ncourse, if we were to design a globally intelligent agent, and not\njust a chess-playing agent, we could get away with having just one\npair of \\(E\\) and \\(U\\). What would \\(E\\) look like if we were\nbuilding a generally intelligent agent and not just an agent that is\ngood at a single task? \\(E\\) would be a model of not just a single\ngame or a task, but the entire physical-social-virtual universe\nconsisting of many games, tasks, situations, problems, etc. This\nproject is (at least currently) hopelessly difficult as, obviously, we\nare nowhere near to having such a comprehensive theory-of-everything\nmodel. For further discussion of a theoretical architecture put\nforward for this problem, see the\n Supplement on the AIXI architecture.\n \n\nIt should be mentioned that there is a different, much more\nstraightforward answer to the \u201cWhat is AI?\u201d question. This\nanswer, which goes back to the days of the original Dartmouth\nconference, was expressed by, among others, Newell (1973), one of the\ngrandfathers of modern-day AI (recall that he attended the 1956\nconference); it is: \n\nAI is the field devoted to building artifacts that are intelligent,\nwhere \u2018intelligent\u2019 is operationalized through\nintelligence tests (such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale),\nand other tests of mental ability (including, e.g., tests of\nmechanical ability, creativity, and so on).\n\n\nThe above definition can be seen as fully specifying a concrete\nversion of Russell and Norvig\u2019s four possible goals. Though few\nare aware of this now, this answer was taken quite seriously for a\nwhile, and in fact underlied one of the most famous programs in the\nhistory of AI: the ANALOGY program of Evans (1968), which solved\ngeometric analogy problems of a type seen in many intelligence tests.\nAn attempt to rigorously define this forgotten form of AI (as what\nthey dub Psychometric AI), and to resurrect it from the days of\nNewell and Evans, is provided by Bringsjord and Schimanski (2003) [see\nalso e.g. (Bringsjord 2011)]. A sizable private investment has been\nmade in the ongoing attempt, now known as\n Project Aristo,\n to build a \u201cdigital Aristotle\u201d, in the form of a machine\nable to excel on standardized tests such at the AP exams tackled by US\nhigh school students (Friedland et al. 2004). (Vibrant work in this\ndirection continues today at the\n Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.)[18]\n In addition, researchers at Northwestern have forged a connection\nbetween AI and tests of mechanical ability (Klenk et al. 2005). \n\nIn the end, as is the case with any discipline, to really know\nprecisely what that discipline is requires you to, at least to some\ndegree, dive in and do, or at least dive in and read. Two decades ago\nsuch a dive was quite manageable. Today, because the content that has\ncome to constitute AI has mushroomed, the dive (or at least the swim\nafter it) is a bit more demanding.\n",
