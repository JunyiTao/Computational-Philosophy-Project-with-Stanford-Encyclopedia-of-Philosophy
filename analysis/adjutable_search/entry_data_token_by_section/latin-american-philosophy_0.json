    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\nThe history of Latin American philosophy is usefully divided into five\nperiods: Pre-Columbian, Colonial, Independentist, Nationalist, and\nContemporary (that is, the twentieth century to the present). Most\nperiods are characterized by the dominance of a particular tradition:\nthe Pre-Columbian by Amerindian religious cosmologies, the Colonial by\nscholasticism, the Independentist by Early Modern philosophy and\nEnlightenment thought, and the Nationalist by positivism. However, the\ncontemporary situation is more complex and varied. For that reason, it\nis discussed in a separate and subsequent section, apart from the\nother historical periods that are the focus of this section.\n\nThere is good evidence that in at least the major pre-Columbian\ncivilizations there were attempts to explore questions about the nature\nof reality, the limits of knowledge, and the basis of right action.\nMoreover, such work persisted in various forms for some time after the\nConquest (Restrepo 2010; Maffie 2014). Whether this body of work is rightly\ncharacterized as philosophy or something else is a disputed matter,\nwith scholars disagreeing about how best to characterize it (see\nNuccetelli, 2001, ch. 3; Mignolo, 2003). It is clear that the\nreflective and speculative work of pre-Columbian Amerindian peoples was\nundertaken without any familiarity with the Western philosophical\ntradition. Those inquiries were also generally undertaken within the\nreligious frameworks of their places and times and the literary or\npresentational modes in which such questions were entertained were\ntypically removed from traditional forms of European philosophical\nproduction.\n\nDespite these differences with European philosophy, and despite the\noften fragmentary and frequently second-hand information that survives\nconcerning pre-Columbian thought, extant works have nevertheless\nsupported a variety of intriguing and subtle accounts of those\nphilosophical or proto-philosophical\n reflections.[1]\nStill, the conventional view about the pre-Columbian\nperiod is that its reflections had little to no impact on the\nindisputably philosophical intellectual production in the period that\nimmediately followed the\n Conquest.[2]\n\nEuropean-derived philosophy began in Latin America in the sixteenth\ncentury. Among the most notable figures of this period is\nBartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas (1484\u20131566), whose work on the\nrights of conquered Amerindians has had a particularly important and\nlong-lasting legacy. Scholasticism, introduced by the Spanish and\nPortuguese clergy that arrived with the conquistadores, was\nthe dominant philosophical perspective. Most of the work produced\nduring the first two centuries in the colonies was cast in the\nframework used in the Iberian peninsula. It was particularly indebted\nto the thought of both sixteenth-century Iberians and their medieval\npredecessors. Important figures included Francisco Su\u00e1rez\n(1548\u20131617) and Francisco de Vitoria (1492\u20131546), and\nearlier medieval philosopher-theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas\n(1225\u20131274) and John Duns Scotus (1265/6\u20131308). Most of\nthese authors were born in the Iberian peninsula, but many of them had\nsettled in the colonies. Among the most important, apart from Las\nCasas, are Alonso de la Vera Cruz (ca.  1504\u201384), who composed\nthe first fully philosophical treatises in Latin America, Tom\u00e1s\nde Mercado (ca. 1530\u20131575), and Antonio Rubio\n(1548\u20131615). Some of the works of these authors, such as Rubio\u2019s\nLogica mexicana, were known and used in Europe.\n\nHumanism also had some influence, as is clear from the work of Juan\nde Zum\u00e1rraga (ca.1468\u20131548) and Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz\n(1651\u20131695), among others. Sor Juana has the distinction of being the\nfirst Latin American thinker to raise questions concerning the status\nof women in Latin American society. She is also retrospectively\nregarded as the first Latin American feminist writer and philosopher\n(see also the section on feminist philosophy, below.)\n\nThe eighteenth century, under the influence of modern philosophy and\nthe Enlightenment, helped prepare the way for the revolutionary wars of\nindependence. Philosophical discussions of the time were dominated by\npolitical thought. Even so, scholasticism continued to influence\nthe intellectual class and stoked an ongoing interest in traditional\nmetaphysical questions. Authors such as Juan Benito D\u00edaz de\nGamarra y D\u00e1valos (1745\u20131783) and Francisco Javier Clavijero\n(1731\u20131787), both from Mexico, were influenced by early modern\nphilosophers such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650). However, the\nwave of independentist thought found its greatest inspiration in\nEnlightenment political philosophy. In particular, liberal political\nideals based on the thought of the French philosophes helped\nto consolidate independentist views throughout Latin America. Among the\nsignificant Latin American inheritors of that tradition were\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (1783\u20131830) in Venezuela and Colombia,\nMiguel Hidalgo (1753\u20131811) and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos\n(1765\u20131815) in Mexico, and much later, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed\n(1854\u20131895) in Cuba.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many Latin American countries secured\nindependence from European colonial powers. In the wake of\nindependence, the newly liberated peoples faced the challenge of\nforming stable, enduring nations out of the remnants of the Spanish\nand Portuguese empires. The predominant political concerns of that era\nincluded the organization and consolidation of the new nations, along\nwith aspirations for social stability, national integration of largely\ndiverse peoples. The overarching ambition in many nations was to\nachieve the same economic and social progress enjoyed by other nations\nin Europe and North America.\n\nIn this context, the ideology of choice was a version of positivism. The positivist\nmotto, \u201corder and progress,\u201d which graces the Brazilian\nflag, suggests why positivism was especially appealing in the context\nof nation building. Positivism\u2019s emphasis on both empirical\nscience and pragmatic solutions appeared to provide a practical\nfoundation for attaining the diverse ends of the new nations. Indeed,\npositivism became so influential and widely accepted by intellectuals\nthat it became the official state philosophy of several nations. It was\neven used to justify dictatorial regimes, as in the case of Mexico.\n\nPositivism of the Latin American variety was derived from a peculiar\nmix of European ideas primarily originating in the thought of Auguste\nComte (1798\u20131857), Herbert Spencer (1820\u20131903), and Ernst Haeckel\n(1834\u20131919). The period of positivist hegemony, in which it was the\ndominant philosophical perspective in Latin America, extended roughly\nfrom the middle of the nineteenth century to the first decade of the\ntwentieth. Among the most famous positivists were Gabino Barreda\n(1818\u20131881) and Justo Sierra (1848\u20131912) in Mexico, Jos\u00e9\nVictorino Lastarria (1817\u20131888) in Chile, and Domingo Faustino\nSarmiento (1811\u20131888) in Argentina. Andr\u00e9s Bello (1781\u20131865),\nfrom both Venezuela and Chile, and Juan Bautista Alberdi (1810\u20131884)\nand Esteban Echevarr\u00eda (1805\u20131851), from Argentina, were\ntransitional figures between independentist liberal thought and\npositivism. Later, Jos\u00e9 Ingenieros (1877\u20131925), from Argentina,\nand Enrique Jos\u00e9 Varona (1849\u20131933), from Cuba, prepared the way\nfor the revolt against positivism, although their thought arose in a\npositivist context and maintained an alliance with positivist\nideas. \n",
