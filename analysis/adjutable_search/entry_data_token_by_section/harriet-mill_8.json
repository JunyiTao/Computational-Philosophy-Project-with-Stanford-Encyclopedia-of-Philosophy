    "main_text": "Taylor Mill\u2019s Influence on Mill || The Countervailing Assessment\n4.3 The Countervailing Assessment\n\nAlice Rossi criticizes this \u201cminimalist\u201d approach to\nestimating Taylor Mill\u2019s influence on Mill when she observes\nthat \u201cone senses in Mill scholars an unwitting desire to reject\nHarriet Taylor as contributing in any significant way to the vigor of\nMill\u2019s analysis of political and social issues unless it\nincluded some tinge of sentiment or political thought the scholar\ndisapproved of, in which case the disliked element was seen as\nHarriet\u2019s influence\u201d (1970, 44\u20135). Some\ncommentators, however, have inclined toward a \u201cmaximalist\u201d\nstance. Chief among these is Jacobs, whose basic interpretative\napproach is to take Mill\u2019s characterizations of Taylor Mill and\ntheir collaboration at face value, although she departs from this\npractice when she believes that there is evidence that Mill may not\nhave given Taylor Mill the full credit she was due. For example, in an\nunpublished essay Taylor Mill writes that\n\nThere seems to be this great distinction between physical and moral\nscience; That while the degree of perfection the first has attained is\nmarked by the progressive completeness and exactness of its rules,\nthat of the latter is in the state most favourable to, and most\nshowing healthfulness as it advances beyond all classification except\non the widest and most universal principles. The science of morals\nshould rather be called an art\u2026. (H. T. Mill, [CW], 141)\n\n\nJacobs takes this comment to establish that Taylor Mill is the\noriginator of Mill\u2019s distinction between the logics of arts and\nsciences at the end of the System of Logic, and she accuses\nMill of having in this case understated Taylor Mill\u2019s\ncontribution to one of his works (Jacobs 2002, 203n27; J. S. Mill,\n[SOL],\n 943\u201352).[7]\n And while Mill states that Taylor Mill learned almost as much from\nhim as he from her, Jacobs appears to think otherwise. In toting up\nthe advantages of the collaboration to each of them, she notes that\n\u201cHarriet administered Mill\u2019s daily life, nursed his ego,\nand provided him with ideas.\u201d In return, according to Jacobs,\nMill gave Taylor Mill little more than Mary Ann Evans got for herself\nby becoming George Eliot: she merely \u201cacquired the freedom to\nwrite provocative articles \u2026 and to be heard as a man, with\nseriousness and consideration\u201d (Jacobs 2002, 129\u201331).\n\nConservative historian Gertrude Himmelfarb also credits Taylor Mill\nwith having made a very significant difference to Mill\u2019s\nphilosophical output, at least during one stage of his life. In\ncontrast to Jacobs, however, she maintains that this influence was\ndecidedly for the worse. She decries in particular Taylor Mill\u2019s\neffect on Mill\u2019s views on liberty, arguing that it was only when\nHarriet\u2019s influence on him was at its peak that Mill embraced a\nsimplistic liberalism grounded on his sweeping and absolute liberty\nprinciple instead of a more nuanced political theory that treats\nliberty as an important value but one that can be limited by other\nvalues (Himmelfarb 1974, 208\u201372). (Himmelfarb\u2019s maximalist\nreading clearly might be seen as a limit case of the approach that\nRossi challenges.)\n",
