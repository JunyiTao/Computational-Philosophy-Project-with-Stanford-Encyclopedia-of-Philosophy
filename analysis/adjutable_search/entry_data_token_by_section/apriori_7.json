As we have\nseen, Timothy Williamson has argued that certain acquired\nskills can be used to provide justification for believing a\nproposition for which the person does not have evidence, namely, the\nskill of bringing ideas together in imagination. His proposal is that\nin the case of the inches/centimeters proposition it is this\nskill at making comparisons of length in imagination, and\nthen observing the results, not a person\u2019s perceptual evidence,\nthat justifies him in believing that proposition.\n\nEven if true, it seems that we can distinguish empirically based from\nunderstanding based employment of a skill. Manipulating in imagination\ntwo circles of unequal radii can bring a person to understand that\nthey cannot intersect in more than two points. Creating an\nimage of a line nine inches long next to an image of a typical ant can\nbring a person to believe that the distance between the front and back\nlegs of a typical ant is less than nine inches, but not that it\nmust be. Science fiction films sometimes depict giant ants that\ncould have been actual. Further, skills at judging, say, that\nin Sheep you do not know that there are sheep in the field is\nbased on your understanding the concept \u201cknowledge\u201d. But\nyour skill in judging that sheep have wool requires more to qualify as\nknowledge than understanding that proposition: you need to know what\nsheep in fact are like. A detective\u2019s skill at deducing via\ndisjunctive syllogism that Jones is the murderer is similar to a\ngeometer\u2019s deducing that a quadrilateral has four interior\nangles or that the Pythagorean Theorem is true, but the nature of the\npremises can make all the difference between whether the reasoning is\na posteriori or a priori. So even if the exercise of\nrelevant skills can provide justification apart from evidence, how the\nskill is used, and in particular on what subject matter, seems to be a\nbasis for distinguishing a priori from a posteriori\n(empirical) justification.\n\nAnother view that rejects the idea that a justified belief must be\nfounded on evidence says that all of our beliefs are\nprima facie justified so all of them are what one might call\n\u201cdefault reasonable\u201d, that is, justified barring reasons\nto reject them (this is what Gilbert Harman (2001) calls\n\u201cgeneral foundationalism\u201d). On some accounts of a\npriori justification, namely those that hold that a\npriori justification is justification independent of\nempirical evidence, general foundationalism would imply that all\nof a person\u2019s beliefs are prima facie (or weakly) a\npriori justified since that justification would stem merely from\nthe fact that the person believes them, not from any empirical\nevidence that supports them. On this view, and contrary to\ninitial appearances, there is really no difference in the way the\npropositions at the start of this essay are prima facie\njustified since they are all weakly a priori justified if you\naccept them. The general foundationalist view might add that, if some\nare all things considered less justified than others, it is\nbecause of the relationships between them. Coherence considerations\naccount for all things considered justification and are what upset\ninitially equal prima facie justification. Further, this view\nhas the implication that you could be prima facie justified\nin believing extremely bizarre propositions, say, beliefs about what\nhappens on the planet Gliese 581d, a planet scientists have\njudged may be \u201cfriendly to life\u201d (Russell 2012: 100), even\nthough you have no empirical or testimonial evidence to support your\nbeliefs about this alien planet. You may, but need not, also believe\nthat the Gliesians are in touch with you (but not others) via\ntelepathy because you are \u201cthe chosen one\u201d. Insofar as you\nhave no defeating evidence, you could even be all things\nconsidered justified in believing all those things about the\nGlieseans, despite having no evidence to support your beliefs. But it\nseems that a coherent set of beliefs about Gliese 581d would not\nprovide a priori justification of all of them even if it\nprovided some sort of justification for them. That would be drawing\nthe boundaries of the a priori too broadly.\n\nHartry Field also holds that belief in certain propositions can be\n\u201cdefault reasonable\u201d, that is, justified but not on the\nbasis of evidence. He seems to think that if a belief\u2019s being\n\u201cdefault reasonable\u201d were sufficient for its being a\npriori justified, too many beliefs would count as being a\npriori justified. That\u2019s because he thinks, for example,\nthat \u201cPeople usually tell the truth\u201d is default reasonable\nbut not a priori justified. So he adds the requirement that\nan a priori justified belief cannot be empirically\ndefeasible (Field 2000: 119\u2013120; cited in Casullo 2012c:\n318\u2013320). But we have seen above that paradigm cases of a\npriori justification can be defeated by empirical considerations\n(see above,\n sec. 3).\n So by adding the requirement of no empirical defeat, Field\u2019s\nview will imply that there are no a priori justifiable\npropositions. On the other hand, if he drops that requirement, he\nfaces the same problem as Harman in drawing the boundaries of a\npriori justification too broadly.\n\nA final view of a priori justification according to which it\ndoes not rest on nonexperiential evidence holds that we are\nentitled to accept certain propositions on no evidence and\nthat entitlement on no grounds or evidence is what a priori\njustification amounts to. To be entitled to accept, or trust, some\npresupposition is for it to be rational to accept or trust\nit, though this is supposed to be different from being justified in\nbelieving it. Crispin Wright proposes that the laws of logic\nand the presupposition that we are not now in the midst of a coherent\nand continuing dream, not now brains-in-a vat, etc., are rational\npresuppositions, some of which are standard presuppositions of\nscience. That\u2019s because certain \u201ccognitive projects\u201d\n(i) could not be pursued without presupposing those things, (ii) there\nis no evidence to think that those presuppositions are false (even if\nalso none to think them true), and (iii) nothing will be lost, and\nsomething may be gained, by accepting these presuppositions (see\nJenkins 2007). The gains and losses must not be pragmatic gains and\nlosses such as gains and losses in happiness, prestige,\naccomplishments, wealth and the like. Otherwise all that would follow\nis that it is practically rational to accept the\npresuppositions. The gains and losses must be epistemic, that is,\nhaving to do with truth, or probable truth, or with evidence because\nWright wants the rational acceptance of such presuppositions to be an\nanswer to the skeptic about knowledge and epistemic justification.\n\nCarrie Jenkins has questioned whether the project-relative rationality\nof a presupposition that Wright proposes is enough to make it rational\nto accept that presupposition (Jenkins 2007). For instance, when\nconducting certain inquiries, it might be rational relative to\nsome project or kind of inquiry to accept that the world is a\npretty orderly place, yet not epistemically rational to accept the\npresupposition itself. Maybe we should suspend judgment about that\nuntil we go look at the world.\n\nWe might think of these presuppositions as heuristics, rules that if\nfollowed usually aid us in the pursuit of truth but in certain\ncontexts can be rationally doubted. Perhaps they do not necessarily\ndetermine what it is rational to believe or accept. In moral\nphilosophy, anti-utilitarians often claim that there are many moral\nrules that prohibit lying, cheating, stealing, torturing, etc, and\nthat these rules sometimes require people not to maximize utility. Act\nutilitarians often respond by saying that these are useful guides to\ndoing what has the best consequences, but they are not definitive of\nwhat makes actions right or wrong. Wright\u2019s presuppositions seem\nto be analogous to what act utilitarians see as heuristics or\nsecondary rules.\n\nIn summary, it seems that accounts of a priori justification\nthat do not hold that it rests on evidence provided by a\nnonexperiential source are in danger of counting certain beliefs or\nacceptances as a priori justified that, intuitively, do not\nseem to be. They are in danger of drawing the circle of a\npriori justification too broadly (Harman), to include\npropositions that are \u201cdefault reasonable\u201d (Field), or are\npresuppositions of science (Wright) that may be justified but do not\nseem to be a priori justified. The attempt by Field to narrow\nthat circle seems to rest on a doubtful assumption, namely, that a\npriori justification cannot be defeated by empirical\nevidence.\n\nIf one thinks that some sort of justification can derive from what is\ndefault reasonable or through relevant entitlements, one might adopt\nCasullo\u2019s view that there are different types of knowledge or\njustification, broadly construed: a priori which rests on\nnonexperiential evidence; a posteriori which rests on\nempirical evidence; and a third type of justification that does not\nrest on any evidence (Casullo 2012c: 324\u2013326). This section has\nraised some problems for this third conception of justification.\n\nWe turn next to considerations that seem to count for the view that\nintellectual intuitions are evidence for the propositions that are\ntheir objects.\n",
