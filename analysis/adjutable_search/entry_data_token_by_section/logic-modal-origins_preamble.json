    "main_text": "\n\nModal logic can be viewed broadly as the logic of different sorts of\nmodalities, or modes of truth: alethic (\u201cnecessarily\u201d),\nepistemic (\u201cit is known that\u201d), deontic (\u201cit ought\nto be the case that\u201d), or temporal (\u201cit is always the case\nthat\u201d) among others. Common logical features of these operators\njustify the common label. In the strict sense however, the term\n\u201cmodal logic\u201d is reserved for the logic of the alethic\nmodalities, as opposed for example to temporal or deontic logic. From\na merely technical point of view, any logic with non-truth-functional\noperators, including first-order logic, can be regarded as a modal\nlogic: in this perspective the quantifiers too can be regarded as\nmodal operators (as in Montague 1960). Nonetheless, we follow the\ntraditional understanding of modal logics as not including\nfull-fledged first-order logic. In this perspective it is the modal\noperators that can be regarded as restricted quantifiers, ranging over\nspecial entities like possible worlds or temporal instants. Arthur\nPrior was one of the first philosophers/logicians to emphasize that\nthe modal system S5 can be translated into a fragment\nof first-order logic, which he called \u201cthe uniform monadic\nfirst-order predicate calculus\u201d (Prior and Fine 1977: 56).\nMonadic, since no relation between worlds needs to be stated for\nS5; and uniform as only one variable is needed to\nquantify over worlds (instants) when bound, and to refer to the\nprivileged state (the actual world or the present time) when free (see\nPrior and Fine 1977). Concerning the technical question of which\nmodel-theoretic features characterize modal logics understood as\nwell-behaved fragments of first-order logic, see Blackburn and van\nBenthem\u2019s \u201cModal Logic: A Semantic Perspective\u201d\n(2007a).\n\nThe scope of this entry is the recent historical development of modal\nlogic, strictly understood as the logic of necessity and possibility,\nand particularly the historical development of systems of modal logic,\nboth syntactically and semantically, from C.I. Lewis\u2019s\npioneering work starting in 1912, with the first systems devised in\n1918, to S. Kripke\u2019s work in the early 1960s. In that short span\nof time of less than fifty years, modal logic flourished both\nphilosophically and mathematically. Mathematically, different modal\nsystems were developed and advances in algebra helped to foster the\nmodel theory for such systems. This culminated in the development of a\nformal semantics that extended to modal logic the successful\nfirst-order model theoretic techniques, thereby affording completeness\nand decidability results for many, but not all, systems.\nPhilosophically, the availability of different systems and the\nadoption of the possible worlds model-theoretic semantics were\nnaturally accompanied by reflections on the nature of possibility and\nnecessity, on distinct sorts of necessities, on the role of the formal\nsemantics, and on the nature of the possible worlds, to mention just a\nfew. In particular, the availability of different systems brings to\nthe fore the philosophical question of which modal logic is the\ncorrect one, under some intended interpretation of the modal\noperators, e.g., as logical or metaphysical necessity. Questions\nconcerning the interpretability of modal logic, especially quantified\nmodal logic, were insistently raised by Quine. All such questions are\nnot pursued in this entry which is mostly devoted to the formal\ndevelopment of the subject. On Quine\u2019s interpretative concerns see\nBallarin 2021.\n\nModal logic is a rich and complex subject matter. This entry does not\npresent a complete survey of all the systems developed and of all the\nmodel theoretic results proved in the lapse of time under\nconsideration. It does however offer a meaningful survey of the main\nsystems aiming to be useful to those looking for an historical outline\nof the subject matter that, even if not all-inclusive, delineates the\nmost interesting model theoretic results and indicates further lines\nof exploration. Bull and Segerberg\u2019s (1984: 3) useful division\nof the original sources of modal logic into three distinct\ntraditions\u2014syntactic, algebraic, and model theoretic\u2014is\nadopted. For other less influential traditions, see Bull and Segerberg\n(1984: 16). See also Lindstr\u00f6m and Segerberg\u2019s \u201cModal\nLogic and Philosophy\u201d (2007). The main focus of this entry is on\npropositional modal logic, while only some particular aspects of the\nsemantics of quantified modal logic are briefly discussed. For a more\ndetailed treatment of quantified modal logic, consult the SEP entry on\n modal logic.\n Concerning the entry\u2019s notation, notice that \\(\\Rightarrow\\) is\nadopted in place of Lewis\u2019s fishhook for strict implication, and\n\\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) for strict equivalence.\n",
