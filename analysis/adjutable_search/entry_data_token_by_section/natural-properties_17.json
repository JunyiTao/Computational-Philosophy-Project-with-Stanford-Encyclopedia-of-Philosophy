    "main_text": "Naturalness and other notions || Ampliative inference\n4.8 Ampliative inference\n\nGoodman\n (1954)\n noticed an epistemologically interesting contrast between the\nproposition that all emeralds are green and the proposition that all\nemeralds are grue (where \u2018grue\u2019 was defined to mean\n\u2018either green and observed before \\(t\\) or blue and not observed\nbefore \\(t\\)\u2019, for some fixed time \\(t\\)). Although Goodman\nhimself does not speak in these terms, one apparent contrast relates\nto rationality: if one gathered many emeralds before \\(t\\)\nand observed all to be green (and therefore also grue), it would be\nrational to become confident that all emeralds are green, whereas it\nwould not be rational in the same circumstances to become confident\nthat all emeralds are\n grue.[56]\n Philosophers who talk about naturalness have generally seen some\nconnection between this contrast and the fact that greenness is more\nnatural than grueness. However, there has been little consensus about\nhow this connection should be worked out.\n\nFollowing Goodman, the contrast is often summarised by saying that\n\u2018green\u2019 or greenness is \u201cprojectible\u201d, and\n\u2018grue\u2019 or grueness is not. Projectibility is also thought\nof as coming in degrees, the idea perhaps being that a generalization\nabout a more projectible property requires less evidence to make a\ngiven level of confidence rational than the corresponding\ngeneralization about a less projectible property. The difficulty of\nmaking this adequately precise, let alone of working backwards from an\nassignment of degrees of projectibility to a description of the\nrational response(s) to some given evidence, should not be\nunderestimated (see Earman\n 1985\n for some distinctions). But insofar as we are willing to theorise in\nterms of both projectibility and naturalness, we can consider the\nsimple proposal that a property\u2019s degree of projectibility is\nequal to its degree of naturalness. One worry about this (see\nWeatherson\n 2013)\n is that one might want to say for other reasons that being\ngreen is much less natural than, say, being electrically\ncharged, whereas there is no obvious sense in which it would take\nless evidence to be rationally convinced that all emeralds are\nelectrically charged than that all emeralds are green.\n\nAnother approach links Goodman\u2019s contrast to the venerable idea\nthat simpler hypotheses are preferable to more complex hypotheses.\nInduction can be understood (Harman\n 1973;\n White\n 2005),\n as a special case of \u201cinference to the best explanation\u201d,\nwhere being \u201cbest\u201d is partly a matter of simplicity: the\nsuggestion is that the hypothesis (i.e. the proposition) that all\nemeralds are green is simpler than the hypothesis that all emeralds\nare grue. The degree of simplicity of a proposition might simply be\nidentified with its degree of naturalness (see\n \u00a73.3\n above).[57]\n\nOn a third approach, inductive inferences are reconstructed as\nepisodes of Bayesian conditionalisation (see the entry on\n Bayesian epistemology),\n so that the grue-green contrast is traced back to the fact that some\nprior credence functions are more rational than others. In\nthis setting, the most straightforward way to bring in naturalness\nwould be to simplify identify the ideally rational prior credence\nfunctions with the maximally natural functions (within the class of\nfunctions meeting certain formal constraints, such as the axioms of\nprobability\n theory).[58]\n One might also take naturalness to be merely one of several factors\ncontributing to rationality. Or one could appeal to it in some other\nway: for example, Dorr and Hawthorne\n (2013)\n suggest that reasonable prior credence functions might be weighted\naverages of all sufficiently natural probability functions, in which\nmore natural probability functions receive higher weights.\n\nOne difficulty for all these ways of invoking naturalness in the\ntheory of rationality is that, given the popular doctrine of\nexternalism about the content of belief, according to which duplicate\nthinkers in different environments can believe different propositions\n(see the entry on\n externalism about mental content),\n they lead to the much less popular doctrine of externalism about\nrationality, according to which duplicate thinkers can differ as\nregards the rationality of the inductive inferences they are engaging\nin. (For some arguments against externalism about rationality, see\nWedgwood\n 2002).\n For example, the discovery (by nineteenth-century mineralologist\nAlexis Damour) that the term \u2018jade\u2019 applies to two\ndifferent minerals, jadeite and nephrite, suggests that being\njade is a less natural property than, say, being\nturquoise. The idea that naturalness is connected to the\nrationality of induction threatens to imply that even before\nDamour\u2019s discovery, rationality required less confidence in\nuniversal generalizations about jade (e.g. that all jade can be\npolished with bamboo) than it would have required for duplicate\nbelievers in worlds where all the nephrite in the actual world had\nbeen replaced by jadeite, so that the word \u2018jade\u2019\nexpressed the property being jadeite. Indeed, even those who\nembrace externalism about rationality on other grounds might not be\nhappy with this particular instance of it: there seems to be something\nirrational about someone who, without the benefit of any special\nobservations like those of Damour, is simply disposed to be more\ncautious in endorsing generalizations about jade than in endorsing\ncorresponding generalizations about turquoise.\n\nTo avoid this result without giving up on externalism about mental\ncontent, one might say that what matters in the theory of rationality\nthe naturalness of concepts rather than properties,\nand say that concepts jade and turquoise are equally\nnatural despite the fact that the properties they correspond to are\nnot. But for this to be illuminating, one will need to provide some\npicture of what concepts are, and how naturalness for them relates to\nnaturalness for properties (see\n \u00a73.3).\n\nWeatherson\n (2013;\n see\n Other Internet Resources)\n has a related objection to the claim that naturalness, understood as\nplaying certain other roles we have already discussed (e.g.\u00a0in\nthe analysis of duplication) also makes for projectibility: he argues\nthat being green is highly projectible whereas being an\nelectron is not highly projectible, since merely finding that all\nobserved electrons have a certain mass does not strongly support the\nconclusion that all electrons have that mass, unless one acquires\nfurther evidence which supports the hypothesis that being an electron\nis very natural. Opponents of externalism about mental content, such\nas Lewis\n (1981),\n might respond that their theory of induction is in the first instance\nabout rationality in the formation of narrow beliefs and\ncredences, and propositions like all electrons have mass\n\\(m\\) are not narrowly believed (see the entry on\n narrow mental content).\n But externalists about content will also need to be cautious about\nembracing Weatherson\u2019s argument, since if they want to speak of\n\u201cdegrees of projectibility\u201d at all, there is pressure for\nthem to say that a single property can be denoted by different\nconcepts with different degrees of projectibility.\n",
