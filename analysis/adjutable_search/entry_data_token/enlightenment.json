The philosophes constituted an\ninformal society of men of letters who collaborated on a loosely\ndefined project of Enlightenment exemplified by the project of the\nEncyclopedia (see below 1.5). However, there are noteworthy\ncenters of Enlightenment outside of France as well. There is a\nrenowned Scottish Enlightenment (key figures are Frances Hutcheson,\nAdam Smith, David Hume, Thomas Reid), a German Enlightenment (die\nAufkl\u00e4rung, key figures of which include Christian Wolff,\nMoses Mendelssohn, G.E. Lessing and Immanuel Kant), and there are also\nother hubs of Enlightenment and Enlightenment thinkers scattered\nthroughout Europe and America in the eighteenth century.\n\nWhat makes for the unity of such tremendously diverse thinkers under\nthe label of \u201cEnlightenment\u201d? For the purposes of this\nentry, the Enlightenment is conceived broadly. D\u2019Alembert, a\nleading figure of the French Enlightenment, characterizes his\neighteenth century, in the midst of it, as \u201cthe century of\nphilosophy par excellence\u201d, because of the tremendous\nintellectual and scientific progress of the age, but also because of\nthe expectation of the age that philosophy (in the broad sense of the\ntime, which includes the natural and social sciences) would\ndramatically improve human life. Guided by D\u2019Alembert\u2019s\ncharacterization of his century, the Enlightenment is conceived here\nas having its primary origin in the scientific revolution of the 16th\nand 17th centuries. The rise of the new science progressively\nundermines not only the ancient geocentric conception of the cosmos,\nbut also the set of presuppositions that had served to constrain and\nguide philosophical inquiry in the earlier times. The dramatic success\nof the new science in explaining the natural world promotes philosophy\nfrom a handmaiden of theology, constrained by its purposes and\nmethods, to an independent force with the power and authority to\nchallenge the old and construct the new, in the realms both of theory\nand practice, on the basis of its own principles. Taking as the core\nof the Enlightenment the aspiration for intellectual progress, and the\nbelief in the power of such progress to improve human society and\nindividual lives, this entry includes descriptions of relevant aspects\nof the thought of earlier thinkers, such as Hobbes, Locke, Descartes,\nBayle, Leibniz, and Spinoza, thinkers whose contributions are\nindispensable to understanding the eighteenth century as \u201cthe\ncentury of philosophy par excellence\u201d.\n\nThe Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions\nand ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789. The energy\ncreated and expressed by the intellectual foment of Enlightenment\nthinkers contributes to the growing wave of social unrest in France in\nthe eighteenth century. The social unrest comes to a head in the\nviolent political upheaval which sweeps away the traditionally and\nhierarchically structured ancien r\u00e9gime (the monarchy,\nthe privileges of the nobility, the political power of the Catholic\nChurch). The French revolutionaries meant to establish in place of the\nancien r\u00e9gime a new reason-based order instituting the\nEnlightenment ideals of liberty and equality. Though the\nEnlightenment, as a diverse intellectual and social movement, has no\ndefinite end, the devolution of the French Revolution into the Terror\nin the 1790s, corresponding, as it roughly does, with the end of the\neighteenth century and the rise of opposed movements, such as\nRomanticism, can serve as a convenient marker of the end of the\nEnlightenment, conceived as an historical period.\n\nFor Enlightenment thinkers themselves, however, the Enlightenment is\nnot an historical period, but a process of social, psychological or\nspiritual development, unbound to time or place. Immanuel Kant defines\n\u201cenlightenment\u201d in his famous contribution to debate on\nthe question in an essay entitled \u201cAn Answer to the Question:\nWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d (1784), as humankind\u2019s release\nfrom its self-incurred immaturity; \u201cimmaturity is the inability\nto use one\u2019s own understanding without the guidance of\nanother.\u201d Expressing convictions shared among Enlightenment\nthinkers of widely divergent doctrines, Kant identifies enlightenment\nwith the process of undertaking to think for oneself, to employ and\nrely on one\u2019s own intellectual capacities in determining what to\nbelieve and how to act. Enlightenment philosophers from across the\ngeographical and temporal spectrum tend to have a great deal of\nconfidence in humanity\u2019s intellectual powers, both to achieve\nsystematic knowledge of nature and to serve as an authoritative guide\nin practical life. This confidence is generally paired with suspicion\nor hostility toward other forms or carriers of authority (such as\ntradition, superstition, prejudice, myth and miracles), insofar as\nthese are seen to compete with the authority of one\u2019s own reason\nand experience. Enlightenment philosophy tends to stand in tension\nwith established religion, insofar as the release from self-incurred\nimmaturity in this age, daring to think for oneself, awakening\none\u2019s intellectual powers, generally requires opposing the role\nof established religion in directing thought and action. The faith of\nthe Enlightenment \u2013 if one may call it that \u2013 is that the\nprocess of enlightenment, of becoming progressively self-directed in\nthought and action through the awakening of one\u2019s intellectual\npowers, leads ultimately to a better, more fulfilled human\nexistence.\n\nThis entry describes the main tendencies of Enlightenment thought in\nthe following main sections: (1) The True: Science, Epistemology, and\nMetaphysics in the Enlightenment; (2) The Good: Political Theory,\nEthical Theory and Religion in the Enlightenment; (3) The Beautiful:\nAesthetics in the Enlightenment.\n", "toc": [{"#TruSciEpiMetEnl": "1.

The True: Science, Epistemology and Metaphysics in the Enlightenment\n\nIn this era dedicated to human progress, the advancement of the\nnatural sciences is regarded as the main exemplification of, and fuel\nfor, such progress. Isaac Newton\u2019s epochal accomplishment in his\nPrincipia Mathematica (1687), which, very briefly described,\nconsists in the comprehension of a diversity of physical phenomena\n\u2013 in particular the motions of heavenly bodies, together with\nthe motions of sublunary bodies \u2013 in few relatively simple,\nuniversally applicable, mathematical laws, was a great stimulus to the\nintellectual activity of the eighteenth century and served as a model\nand inspiration for the researches of a number of Enlightenment\nthinkers. Newton\u2019s system strongly encourages the Enlightenment\nconception of nature as an orderly domain governed by strict\nmathematical-dynamical laws and the conception of ourselves\nas capable of knowing those laws and of plumbing the secrets of nature\nthrough the exercise of our unaided faculties. \u2013 The conception\nof nature, and of how we know it, changes significantly with the rise\nof modern science. It belongs centrally to the agenda of Enlightenment\nphilosophy to contribute to the new knowledge of nature, and to\nprovide a metaphysical framework within which to place and interpret\nthis new knowledge.\n1.1 Rationalism and the Enlightenment\n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 rationalist system of philosophy is one\nof the pillars on which Enlightenment thought rests. Descartes\n(1596\u20131650) undertakes to establish the sciences upon a secure\nmetaphysical foundation. The famous method of doubt Descartes employs\nfor this purpose exemplifies (in part through exaggerating) an\nattitude characteristic of the Enlightenment. According to Descartes,\nthe investigator in foundational philosophical research ought to doubt\nall propositions that can be doubted. The investigator determines\nwhether a proposition is dubitable by attempting to construct a\npossible scenario under which it is false. In the domain of\nfundamental scientific (philosophical) research, no other authority\nbut one\u2019s own conviction is to be trusted, and not one\u2019s\nown conviction either, until it is subjected to rigorous skeptical\nquestioning. With his method, Descartes casts doubt upon the senses as\nauthoritative source of knowledge. He finds that God and the\nimmaterial soul are both better known, on the basis of innate ideas,\nthan objects of the senses. Through his famous doctrine of the dualism\nof mind and body, that mind and body are two distinct substances, each\nwith its own essence, the material world (allegedly) known through the\nsenses becomes denominated as an \u201cexternal\u201d world, insofar\nas it is external to the ideas with which one immediately communes in\none\u2019s consciousness. Descartes\u2019 investigation thus\nestablishes one of the central epistemological problems, not only of\nthe Enlightenment, but also of modernity: the problem of objectivity\nin our empirical knowledge. If our evidence for the truth of\npropositions about extra-mental material reality is always restricted\nto mental content, content before the mind, how can we ever be certain\nthat the extra-mental reality is not other than we represent it as\nbeing? Descartes\u2019 solution depends on our having secured prior\nand certain knowledge of God. In fact, Descartes argues that\nall human knowledge (not only knowledge of the material world\nthrough the senses) depends on metaphysical knowledge of God.\n\nDespite Descartes\u2019 grounding of all scientific knowledge in\nmetaphysical knowledge of God, his system contributes significantly to\nthe advance of natural science in the period. He attacks the\nlong-standing assumptions of the scholastic-aristotelians whose\nintellectual dominance stood in the way of the development of the new\nscience; he developed a conception of matter that enabled mechanical\nexplanation of physical phenomena; and he developed some of the\nfundamental mathematical resources \u2013 in particular, a way to\nemploy algebraic equations to solve geometrical problems \u2013 that\nenabled the physical domain to be explained with precise, simple\nmathematical formulae. Furthermore, his grounding of physics, and all\nknowledge, in a relatively simple and elegant rationalist metaphysics\nprovides a model of a rigorous and complete secular system of\nknowledge. Though major Enlightenment thinkers (for example Voltaire\nin his Letters on the English Nation, 1734) embrace\nNewton\u2019s physical system in preference to Descartes\u2019,\nNewton\u2019s system itself depends on Descartes\u2019 earlier work,\na dependence to which Newton himself attests.\n\nCartesian philosophy also ignites various controversies in the latter\ndecades of the seventeenth century that provide the context of\nintellectual tumult out of which the Enlightenment springs. Among\nthese controversies are the following: Are mind and body really two\ndistinct sorts of substances, and if so, what is the nature of each,\nand how are they related to each other, both in the human being (which\npresumably \u201chas\u201d both a mind and a body) and in a unified\nworld system? If matter is inert (as Descartes claims), what can be\nthe source of motion and the nature of causality in the physical\nworld? And of course the various epistemological problems: the problem\nof objectivity, the role of God in securing our knowledge, the\ndoctrine of innate ideas, and others.\n\nBaruch Spinoza\u2019s systematic rationalist metaphysics, which he\ndevelops in his Ethics (1677) in part in response to problems\nin the Cartesian system, is also an important basis for Enlightenment\nthought. Spinoza develops, in contrast to Cartesian dualism, an\nontological monism according to which there is only one substance, God\nor nature, with two attributes, corresponding to mind and body.\nSpinoza\u2019s denial, on the basis of strict philosophical\nreasoning, of the existence of a transcendent supreme being, his\nidentification of God with nature, gives strong impetus to the strands\nof atheism and naturalism that thread through Enlightenment\nphilosophy. Spinoza\u2019s rationalist principles also lead him to\nassert a strict determinism and to deny any role to final causes or\nteleology in explanation. (See Israel 2001.)\n\nThe rationalist metaphysics of Leibniz (1646\u20131716) is also\nfoundational for the Enlightenment, particularly the German\nEnlightenment (die Aufkl\u00e4rung), one prominent expression\nof which is the Leibnizian rationalist system of Christian Wolff\n(1679\u20131754). Leibniz articulates, and places at the head of\nmetaphysics, the great rationalist principle, the principle of\nsufficient reason, which states that everything that exists has a\nsufficient reason for its existence. This principle exemplifies the\ncharacteristic conviction of the Enlightenment that the universe is\nthoroughly rationally intelligible. The question arises of how this\nprinciple itself can be known or grounded. Wolff attempts to derive it\nfrom the logical principle of non-contradiction (in his First\nPhilosophy or Ontology, 1730). Criticism of this alleged\nderivation gives rise to the general question of how formal principles\nof logic can possibly serve to ground substantive knowledge of\nreality. Whereas Leibniz exerts his influence through scattered\nwritings on various topics, some of which elaborate plans for a\nsystematic metaphysics which are never executed by Leibniz himself,\nWolff exerts his influence on the German Enlightenment through his\ndevelopment of a rationalist system of knowledge in which he attempts\nto demonstrate all the propositions of science from first principles,\nknown a priori.\n\nWolff\u2019s rationalist metaphysics is characteristic of the\nEnlightenment by virtue of the pretensions of human reason\nwithin it, not by reason\u2019s success in establishing its claims.\nMuch the same could be said of the great rationalist philosophers of\nthe seventeenth century. Through their articulation of the\nideal of scientia, of a complete science of reality, composed\nof propositions derived demonstratively from a priori first\nprinciples, these philosophers exert great influence on the\nEnlightenment. But they fail, rather spectacularly, to realize this\nideal. To the contrary, what they bequeath to the eighteenth century\nis metaphysics, in the words of Kant, as \u201ca battlefield of\nendless controversies.\u201d However, the controversies themselves\n\u2013 regarding the nature of God, mind, matter, substance, cause,\net cetera, and the relations of each of these to the others \u2013\nprovide tremendous fuel to Enlightenment thought.\n1.2 Empiricism and the Enlightenment\n\nDespite the confidence in and enthusiasm for human reason in the\nEnlightenment \u2013 it is sometimes called \u201cthe Age of\nReason\u201d \u2013 the rise of empiricism, both in the practice of\nscience and in the theory of knowledge, is characteristic of the\nperiod. The enthusiasm for reason in the Enlightenment is primarily\nnot for the faculty of reason as an independent source of knowledge,\nwhich is embattled in the period, but rather for the human cognitive\nfaculties generally; the Age of Reason contrasts with an age of\nreligious faith, not with an age of sense experience. Though the great\nseventeenth century rationalist metaphysical systems of Descartes,\nSpinoza and Leibniz exert tremendous influence on philosophy in the\nEnlightenment; moreover, and though the eighteenth-century\nEnlightenment has a rationalist strain (perhaps best exemplified by\nthe system of Christian Wolff), nevertheless, that the\nEncyclopedia of Diderot and D\u2019Alembert is dedicated to\nthree empiricists (Francis Bacon, John Locke and Isaac Newton),\nsignals the ascendency of empiricism in the period.\n\nIf the founder of the rationalist strain of the Enlightenment is\nDescartes, then the founder of the empiricist strain is Francis Bacon\n(1561\u20131626). Though Bacon\u2019s work belongs to the\nRenaissance, the revolution he undertook to effect in the sciences\ninspires and influences Enlightenment thinkers. The Enlightenment, as\nthe age in which experimental natural science matures and comes into\nits own, admires Bacon as \u201cthe father of experimental\nphilosophy.\u201d Bacon\u2019s revolution (enacted in, among other\nworks, The New Organon, 1620) involves conceiving the new\nscience as (1) founded on empirical observation and experimentation;\n(2) arrived at through the method of induction; and (3) as ultimately\naiming at, and as confirmed by, enhanced practical capacities (hence\nthe Baconian motto, \u201cknowledge is power\u201d).\n\nOf these elements of Bacon\u2019s revolution, the point about method\ndeserves special emphasis. Isaac Newton\u2019s work, which stands as\nthe great exemplar of the accomplishments of natural science for the\neighteenth century, is, like Bacon\u2019s, based on the inductive\nmethod. Whereas rationalist of the seventeenth century tend to\nconceive of scientific knowledge of nature as consisting in a system\nin which statements expressing the observable phenomena of nature are\ndeduced from first principles, known a priori, Newton\u2019s\nmethod begins with the observed phenomena of nature and reduces its\nmultiplicity to unity by induction, that is, by finding mathematical\nlaws or principles from which the observed phenomena can be derived or\nexplained. The evident success of Newton\u2019s\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d procedure contrasts sharply with the seemingly\nendless and fruitless conflicts among philosophers regarding the\nmeaning and validity of first principles of reason, and this contrast\nnaturally favors the rise of the Newtonian (or Baconian) method of\nacquiring knowledge of nature in the eighteenth century.\n\nThe tendency of natural science toward progressive independence from\nmetaphysics in the eighteenth century is correlated with this point\nabout method. The rise of modern science in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries proceeds through its separation from the\npresuppositions, doctrines and methodology of theology; natural\nscience in the eighteenth century proceeds to separate itself from\nmetaphysics as well. Newton proves the capacity of natural science to\nsucceed independently of a priori, clear and certain first principles.\nThe characteristic Enlightenment suspicion of all allegedly\nauthoritative claims the validity of which is obscure, which is\ndirected first of all against religious dogmas, extends to the claims\nof metaphysics as well. While there are significant Enlightenment\nthinkers who are metaphysicians \u2013 again, one thinks of Christian\nWolff \u2013 the general thrust of Enlightenment thought is\nanti-metaphysical.\n\nJohn Locke\u2019s Essay Concerning Human Understanding\n(1690) is another foundational text of the Enlightenment. A main\nsource of its influence is the epistemological rigor that it displays,\nwhich is at least implicitly anti-metaphysical. Locke undertakes in\nthis work to examine the human understanding in order to determine the\nlimits of human knowledge; he thereby institutes a prominent pattern\nof Enlightenment epistemology. Locke finds the source of all our\nideas, the ideas out of which human knowledge is constructed, in the\nsenses and argues influentially against the rationalists\u2019\ndoctrine of innate ideas. Locke\u2019s sensationalism exerts great\ninfluence in the French Enlightenment, primarily through being taken\nup and radicalized by the philosophe, Abb\u00e9 de\nCondillac. In the Treatise on Sensations (1754), Condillac\nattempts to explain how all human knowledge arises out of sense\nexperience. Locke\u2019s epistemology, as developed by Condillac and\nothers, contributes greatly to the emerging science of psychology in\nthe period.\n\nLocke and Descartes both pursue a method in epistemology that brings\nwith it the epistemological problem of objectivity. Both examine our\nknowledge by way of examining the ideas we encounter directly in our\nconsciousness. This method comes to be called \u201cthe way of\nideas\u201d. Though neither for Locke nor for Descartes do\nall of our ideas represent their objects by way of\nresembling them (e.g., our idea of God does not represent God\nby virtue of resembling God), our alleged knowledge of our environment\nthrough the senses does depend largely on ideas that allegedly\nresemble external material objects. The way of ideas implies the\nepistemological problem of how we can know that these ideas do in fact\nresemble their objects. How can we be sure that these objects do not\nappear one way before the mind and exist in another way (or not at\nall) in reality outside the mind? George Berkeley, an empiricist\nphilosopher influenced by John Locke, avoids the problem by asserting\nthe metaphysics of idealism: the (apparently material) objects of\nperception are nothing but ideas before the mind. However,\nBerkeley\u2019s idealism is less influential in, and characteristic\nof, the Enlightenment, than the opposing positions of materialism and\nCartesian dualism. Thomas Reid, a prominent member of the Scottish\nEnlightenment, attacks the way of ideas and argues that the immediate\nobjects of our (sense) perception are the common (material) objects in\nour environment, not ideas in our mind. Reid mounts his defense of\nna\u00efve realism as a defense of common sense over against the\ndoctrines of the philosophers. The defense of common sense, and the\nrelated idea that the results of philosophy ought to be of use to\ncommon people, are characteristic ideas of the Enlightenment,\nparticularly pronounced in the Scottish Enlightenment.\n1.3 Skepticism in the Enlightenment\n\nSkepticism enjoys a remarkably strong place in Enlightenment\nphilosophy, given that confidence in our intellectual capacities to\nachieve systematic knowledge of nature is a leading characteristic of\nthe age. This oddity is at least softened by the point that much\nskepticism in the Enlightenment is merely methodological, a tool meant\nto serve science, rather than a position embraced on its own account.\nThe instrumental role for skepticism is exemplified prominently in\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations on First Philosophy (1641), in\nwhich Descartes employs radical skeptical doubt to attack prejudices\nderived from learning and from sense experience and to search out\nprinciples known with certainty which may serve as a secure foundation\nfor a new system of knowledge. Given the negative, critical,\nsuspicious attitude of the Enlightenment towards doctrines\ntraditionally regarded as well founded, it is not surprising that\nEnlightenment thinkers employ skeptical tropes (drawn from the ancient\nskeptical tradition) to attack traditional dogmas in science,\nmetaphysics and religion.\n\nHowever, skepticism is not merely a methodological tool in the hands\nof Enlightenment thinkers. The skeptical cast of mind is one prominent\nmanifestation of the Enlightenment spirit. The influence of Pierre\nBayle, another founding figure of the Enlightenment, testifies to\nthis. Bayle was a French Protestant, who, like many European\nphilosophers of his time, was forced to live and work in politically\nliberal and tolerant Holland in order to avoid censorship and prison.\nBayle\u2019s Historical and Critical Dictionary (1697), a\nstrange and wonderful book, exerts great influence on the age. The\nform of the book is intimidating: a biographical dictionary, with long\nscholarly entries on obscure figures in the history of culture,\ninterrupted by long scholarly footnotes, which are in turn interrupted\nby further footnotes. Rarely has a work with such intimidating\nscholarly pretentions exerted such radical and liberating influence in\nthe culture. It exerts this influence through its skeptical\nquestioning of religious, metaphysical, and scientific dogmas.\nBayle\u2019s eclecticism and his tendency to follow arguments without\npre-arranging their conclusions make it difficult to categorize his\nthought. It is the attitude of inquiry that Bayle displays, rather\nthan any doctrine he espouses, that mark his as distinctively\nEnlightenment thought. He is fearless and presumptuous in questioning\nall manner of dogma. His attitude of inquiry resembles both that of\nDescartes\u2019 meditator and that of the person undergoing\nenlightenment as Kant defines it, the attitude of coming to think for\noneself, of daring to know. This epistemological attitude, as manifest\nin distrust of authority and reliance on one\u2019s own capacity to\njudge, expresses the Enlightenment values of individualism and\nself-determination.\n\nThis skeptical/critical attitude underlies a significant tension in\nthe age. While it is common to conceive of the Enlightenment as\nsupplanting the authority of tradition and religious dogma with the\nauthority of reason, in fact the Enlightenment is characterized by a\ncrisis of authority regarding any belief. This is perhaps best\nillustrated with reference to David Hume\u2019s skepticism, as\ndeveloped in Book One of A Treatise of Human Nature\n(1739\u201340) and in his later Enquiries Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1748). While one might take Hume\u2019s\nskepticism to imply that he is an outlier with respect to the\nEnlightenment, it is more convincing to see Hume\u2019s skepticism as\na flowering of a crisis regarding authority in belief that is internal\nto the Enlightenment. Hume articulates a variety of skepticisms. His\n\u201cskepticism with regard to the senses\u201d is structured by\nthe epistemological problem bound up with the way of ideas, described\nabove. Hume also articulates skepticism with regard to reason in an\nargument that is anticipated by Bayle. Hume begins this argument by\nnoting that, though rules or principles in demonstrative sciences are\ncertain or infallible, given the fallibility of our faculties, our\napplications of such rules or principles in demonstrative inferences\nyield conclusions that cannot be regarded as certain or infallible. On\nreflection, our conviction in the conclusions of demonstrative\nreasoning must be qualified by an assessment of the likelihood that we\nmade a mistake in our reasoning. Thus, Hume writes, \u201call\nknowledge degenerates into probability\u201d (Treatise,\nI.iv.i). Hume argues further that, given this degeneration, for any\njudgment, our assessment of the likelihood that we made a mistake, and\nthe corresponding diminution of certainty in the conclusion, is\nanother judgment about which we ought make a further assessment, which\nleads to a further diminution of certainty in our original conclusion,\nleading \u201cat last [to] a total extinction of belief and\nevidence\u201d. Hume also famously questions the justification of\ninductive reasoning and causal reasoning. According to Hume\u2019s\nargument, since in causal reasoning we take our past observations to\nserve as evidence for judgments regarding what will happen in\nrelevantly similar circumstances in the future, causal reasoning\ndepends on the assumption that the future course of nature will\nresemble the past; and there is no non-circular justification of this\nessential assumption. Hume concludes that we have no rational\njustification for our causal or inductive judgments. Hume\u2019s\nskeptical arguments regarding causal reasoning are more radical than\nhis skeptical questioning of reason as such, insofar as they call into\nquestion even experience itself as a ground for knowledge and\nimplicitly challenge the credentials of Newtonian science itself, the\nvery pride of the Enlightenment. The question implicitly raised by\nHume\u2019s powerful skeptical arguments is whether any\nepistemological authority at all can withstand critical scrutiny. The\nEnlightenment begins by unleashing skepticism in attacking limited,\ncircumscribed targets, but once the skeptical genie is out of the\nbottle, it becomes difficult to maintain conviction in any authority.\nThus, the despairing attitude that Hume famously expresses in the\nconclusion to Book One of the Treatise, as the consequence of\nhis epistemological inquiry, while it clashes with the self-confident\nand optimistic attitude we associate with the Enlightenment, in fact\nreflects an essential possibility in a distinctive Enlightenment\nproblematic regarding authority in belief.\n1.4 Science of Man and Subjectivism in the Enlightenment\n\nThough Hume finds himself struggling with skepticism in the conclusion\nof Book One of the Treatise, the project of the work as he\noutlines it is not to advance a skeptical viewpoint, but to establish\na science of the mind. Hume is one of many Enlightenment thinkers who\naspire to be the \u201cNewton of the mind\u201d; he aspires to\nestablish the basic laws that govern the elements of the human mind in\nits operations. Alexander Pope\u2019s famous couplet in An Essay\non Man (1733) (\u201cKnow then thyself, presume not God to scan/\nThe proper study of mankind is man\u201d) expresses well the intense\ninterest humanity gains in itself within the context of the\nEnlightenment, as a partial substitute for its traditional interest in\nGod and the transcendent domain. Just as the sun replaces the earth as\nthe center of our cosmos in Copernicus\u2019 cosmological system, so\nhumanity itself replaces God at the center of humanity\u2019s\nconsciousness in the Enlightenment. Given the Enlightenment\u2019s\npassion for science, the self-directed attention naturally takes the\nform of the rise of the scientific study of humanity in the\nperiod.\n\nThe enthusiasm for the scientific study of humanity in the period\nincorporates a tension or paradox concerning the place of humanity in\nthe cosmos, as the cosmos is re-conceived in the context of\nEnlightenment philosophy and science. Newton\u2019s success early in\nthe Enlightenment of subsuming the phenomena of nature under universal\nlaws of motion, expressed in simple mathematical formulae, encourages\nthe conception of nature as a very complicated machine, whose parts\nare material and whose motions and properties are fully accounted for\nby deterministic causal laws. But if our conception of nature is of an\nexclusively material domain governed by deterministic, mechanical\nlaws, and if we at the same time deny the place of the supernatural in\nthe cosmos, then how does humanity itself fit into the cosmos? On the\none hand, the achievements of the natural sciences in general are the\ngreat pride of the Enlightenment, manifesting the excellence of\ndistinctively human capacities. The pride and self-assertiveness of\nhumanity in the Enlightenment expresses itself, among other ways, in\nhumanity\u2019s making the study of itself its central concern. On\nthe other hand, the study of humanity in the Enlightenment typically\nyields a portrait of us that is the opposite of flattering or\nelevating. Instead of being represented as occupying a privileged\nplace in nature, as made in the image of God, humanity is represented\ntypically in the Enlightenment as a fully natural creature, devoid of\nfree will, of an immortal soul, and of a non-natural faculty of\nintelligence or reason. The very title of J.O. de La Mettrie\u2019s\nMan a Machine (1748), for example, seems designed to deflate\nhumanity\u2019s self-conception, and in this respect it is\ncharacteristic of the Enlightenment \u201cscience of man\u201d. It\nis true of a number of works of the Enlightenment, perhaps especially\nworks in the more radical French Enlightenment \u2013 notable here\nare Helv\u00e9tius\u2019s Of the Spirit (1758) and Baron\nd\u2019Holbach\u2019s System of Nature (1770) \u2013 that\nthey at once express the remarkable self-assertiveness of humanity\ncharacteristic of the Enlightenment in their scientific aspirations\nwhile at the same time painting a portrait of humanity that\ndramatically deflates its traditional self-image as occupying a\nprivileged position in nature.\n\nThe methodology of epistemology in the period reflects a similar\ntension. Given the epistemological role of Descartes\u2019 famous\n\u201ccogito, ergo sum\u201d in his system of knowledge,\none might see Descartes\u2019 epistemology as already marking the\ntransition from an epistemology privileging knowledge of God to one\nthat privileges self-knowledge instead. However, in Descartes\u2019\nepistemology, it remains true that knowledge of God serves as the\nnecessary foundation for all human knowledge. Hume\u2019s\nTreatise displays such a re-orientation less ambiguously. As\nnoted, Hume means his work to comprise a science of the mind or of\nman. In the Introduction, Hume describes the science of man as\neffectively a foundation for all the sciences since all sciences\n\u201clie under the cognizance of men, and are judged of by their\npowers and faculties.\u201d In other words, since all science is\nhuman knowledge, scientific knowledge of humanity is the\nfoundation of the sciences. Hume\u2019s placing the science of man at\nthe foundation of all the sciences both exemplifies the privilege\nafforded to \u201cmankind\u2019s study of man\u201d within the\nEnlightenment and provides an interpretation of it. But Hume\u2019s\nmethodological privileging of humanity in the system of sciences\ncontrasts sharply with what he says in the body of his science about\nhumanity. In Hume\u2019s science of man, reason as a faculty of\nknowledge is skeptically attacked and marginalized; reason is\nattributed to other animals as well; belief is shown to be grounded in\ncustom and habit; and free will is denied. So, even as knowledge of\nhumanity supplants knowledge of God as the keystone of the system of\nknowledge, the scientific perspective on humanity starkly challenges\nhumankind\u2019s self-conception as occupying a privileged position\nin the order of nature.\n\nImmanuel Kant explicitly enacts a revolution in epistemology modeled\non the Copernican in astronomy. As characteristic of Enlightenment\nepistemology, Kant, in his Critique of Pure Reason (1781,\nsecond edition 1787) undertakes both to determine the limits of our\nknowledge, and at the same time to provide a foundation of scientific\nknowledge of nature, and he attempts to do this by examining our human\nfaculties of knowledge critically. Even as he draws strict limits to\nrational knowledge, he attempts to defend reason as a faculty of\nknowledge, as playing a necessary role in natural science, in the face\nof skeptical challenges that reason faces in the period. According to\nKant, scientific knowledge of nature is not merely knowledge of what\nin fact happens in nature, but knowledge of the causal laws\nof nature according to which what in fact happens must\nhappen. But how is knowledge of necessary causal connection in nature\npossible? Hume\u2019s investigation of the idea of cause had made\nclear that we cannot know causal necessity through experience;\nexperience teaches us at most what in fact happens, not what\nmust happen. In addition, Kant\u2019s own earlier critique\nof principles of rationalism had convinced him that the principles of\n(\u201cgeneral\u201d) logic also cannot justify knowledge of\nreal necessary connections (in nature); the formal principle\nof non-contradiction can ground at best the deduction of one\nproposition from another, but not the claim that one\nproperty or event must follow from another in the\ncourse of nature. The generalized epistemological problem Kant\naddresses in the Critique of Pure Reason is: how is science\npossible (including natural science, mathematics, metaphysics), given\nthat all such knowledge must be (or include) knowledge of real,\nsubstantive (not merely logical or formal) necessities. Put in the\nterms Kant defines, the problem is: how is synthetic, a priori\nknowledge possible?\n\nAccording to Kant\u2019s Copernican Revolution in epistemology\naddressed to this problem, objects must conform themselves to human\nknowledge rather than knowledge to objects. Certain cognitive forms\nlie ready in the human mind \u2013 prominent examples are the pure\nconcepts of substance and cause and the forms of intuition, space and\ntime; given sensible representations must conform themselves to these\nforms in order for human experience (as empirical knowledge of nature)\nto be possible at all. We can acquire scientific knowledge of nature\nbecause we constitute it a priori according to certain cognitive\nforms; for example, we can know nature as a causally ordered domain\nbecause we originally synthesize a priori the given manifold of\nsensibility according to the category of causality, which has its\nsource in the human mind.\n\nKant saves rational knowledge of nature by limiting rational knowledge\nto nature. According to Kant\u2019s argument, we can have rational\nknowledge only of the domain of possible experience, not of\nsupersensible objects such as God and the soul. Moreover Kant\u2019s\nsolution brings with it a kind of idealism: given the mind\u2019s\nrole in constituting objects of experience, we know objects only as\nappearances, only as they appear according to our faculties,\nnot as they are in themselves. This is the subjectivism of\nKant\u2019s epistemology. Kant\u2019s epistemology exemplifies\nEnlightenment thought by replacing the theocentric conception of\nknowledge of the rationalist tradition with an anthropocentric\nconception.\n\nHowever, Kant means his system to make room for humanity\u2019s\npractical and religious aspirations toward the transcendent as well.\nAccording to Kant\u2019s idealism, the realm of nature is limited to\na realm of appearances, and we can intelligibly think supersensible\nobjects such as God, freedom and the soul, though we cannot know them.\nThrough the postulation of a realm of unknowable noumena (things in\nthemselves) over against the realm of nature as a realm of\nappearances, Kant manages to make place for practical concepts that\nare central to our understanding of ourselves even while grounding our\nscientific knowledge of nature as a domain governed by deterministic\ncausal laws. Though Kant\u2019s idealism is highly controversial from\nits initial publication, a main point in its favor, according to Kant\nhimself, is that it reconciles, in a single coherent tension, the main\ntension between the Enlightenment\u2019s conception of nature, as\nordered according to deterministic causal laws, and the\nEnlightenment\u2019s conception of ourselves, as morally free, as\nhaving dignity, and as perfectible.\n1.5 Emerging Sciences and the Encyclopedia\n\nThe commitment to careful observation and description of phenomena as\nthe starting point of science, and then the success at explaining and\naccounting for observed phenomena through the method of induction,\nnaturally leads to the development of new sciences for new domains in\nthe Enlightenment. Many of the human and social sciences have their\norigins in the eighteenth century (e.g., history, anthropology,\naesthetics, psychology, economics, even sociology), though most are\nonly formally established as autonomous disciplines later. The\nemergence of new sciences is aided by the development of new\nscientific tools, such as models for probabilistic reasoning, a kind\nof reasoning that gains new respect and application in the period.\nDespite the multiplication of sciences in the period, the ideal\nremains to comprehend the diversity of our scientific knowledge as a\nunified system of science; however, this ideal of unity is generally\ntaken as regulative, as an ideal to emerge in the ever-receding\nend-state of science, rather than as enforced from the beginning by\nregimenting science under a priori principles.\n\nAs exemplifying these and other tendencies of the Enlightenment, one\nwork deserves special mention: the Encyclopedia, edited by\nDenis Diderot and Jean La Rond d\u2019Alembert. The\nEncyclopedia (subtitled: \u201csystematic dictionary of\nthe sciences, arts and crafts\u201d) was published in 28 volumes\n(17 of text, 11 of plates) over 21 years (1751\u20131772), and\nconsists of over 70,000 articles, contributed by over 140\ncontributors, among them many of the luminaries of the French\nEnlightenment. The work aims to provide a compendium of existing human\nknowledge to be transmitted to subsequent generations, a transmission\nintended to contribute to the progress and dissemination of human\nknowledge and to a positive transformation of human society. The\norientation of the Encyclopedia is decidedly secular and\nimplicitly anti-authoritarian. Accordingly, the French state of the\nancien r\u00e9gime censors the project, and it is completed\nonly through the persistence of Diderot. The collaborative nature of\nthe project, especially in the context of state opposition,\ncontributes significantly to the formation of a shared sense of\npurpose among the wide variety of intellectuals who belong to the\nFrench Enlightenment. The knowledge contained in the\nEncyclopedia is self-consciously social both in its\nproduction \u2013 insofar as it is immediately the product of what\nthe title page calls \u201ca society of men of letters\u201d \u2013\nand in its address \u2013 insofar as it is primarily meant as an\ninstrument for the education and improvement of society. It is a\nstriking feature of the Encyclopedia, and one by virtue of\nwhich it exemplifies the Baconian conception of science characteristic\nof the period, that its entries cover the whole range and scope of\nknowledge, from the most abstract theoretical to the most practical,\nmechanical and technical. \n2. The Good: Political Theory, Ethical Theory and Religion in the Enlightenment\n2.1 Political Theory\n\nThe Enlightenment is most identified with its political\naccomplishments. The era is marked by three political revolutions,\nwhich together lay the basis for modern, republican, constitutional\ndemocracies: The English Revolution (1688), the American Revolution\n(1775\u201383), and the French Revolution (1789\u201399). The\nsuccess at explaining and understanding the natural world encourages\nthe Enlightenment project of re-making the social/political world, in\naccord with the models we allegedly find in our reason. Enlightenment\nphilosophers find that the existing social and political orders do not\nwithstand critical scrutiny. Existing political and social authority\nis shrouded in religious myth and mystery and founded on obscure\ntraditions. The criticism of existing institutions is supplemented\nwith the positive work of constructing in theory the model of\ninstitutions as they ought to be. We owe to this period the basic\nmodel of government founded upon the consent of the governed; the\narticulation of the political ideals of freedom and equality and the\ntheory of their institutional realization; the articulation of a list\nof basic individual human rights to be respected and realized by any\nlegitimate political system; the articulation and promotion of\ntoleration of religious diversity as a virtue to be respected in a\nwell ordered society; the conception of the basic political powers as\norganized in a system of checks and balances; and other now-familiar\nfeatures of western democracies. However, for all the enduring\naccomplishments of Enlightenment political philosophy, it is not clear\nthat human reason proves powerful enough to put a concrete, positive\nauthoritative ideal in place of the objects of its criticism. As in\nthe epistemological domain, reason shows its power more convincingly\nin criticizing authorities than in establishing them. Here too the\nquestion of the limits of reason is one of the main philosophical\nlegacies of the period. These limits are arguably vividly illustrated\nby the course of the French Revolution. The explicit ideals of the\nFrench Revolution are the Enlightenment ideals of individual freedom\nand equality; but, as the revolutionaries attempt to devise rational,\nsecular institutions to put in place of those they have violently\noverthrown, eventually they have recourse to violence and terror in\norder to control and govern the people. The devolution of the French\nRevolution into the Reign of Terror is perceived by many as proving\nthe emptiness and hypocrisy of Enlightenment reason, and is one of the\nmain factors which account for the end of the Enlightenment as an\nhistorical period.\n\nThe political revolutions of the Enlightenment, especially the French\nand the American, were informed and guided to a significant extent by\nprior political philosophy in the period. Though Thomas Hobbes, in his\nLeviathan (1651), defends the absolute power of the political\nsovereign, and is to that extent opposed to the revolutionaries and\nreformers in England, this work is a founding work of Enlightenment\npolitical theory. Hobbes\u2019 work originates the modern social\ncontract theory, which incorporates Enlightenment conceptions of the\nrelation of the individual to the state. According to the general\nsocial contract model, political authority is grounded in an agreement\n(often understood as ideal, rather than real) among individuals, each\nof whom aims in this agreement to advance his rational self-interest\nby establishing a common political authority over all. Thus, according\nto the general contract model (though this is more clear in later\ncontract theorists such as Locke and Rousseau than in Hobbes himself),\npolitical authority is grounded not in conquest, natural or divinely\ninstituted hierarchy, or in obscure myths and traditions, but rather\nin the rational consent of the governed. In initiating this model,\nHobbes takes a naturalistic, scientific approach to the question of\nhow political society ought to be organized (against the background of\na clear-eyed, unsentimental conception of human nature), and thus\ndecisively influences the Enlightenment process of secularization and\nrationalization in political and social philosophy.\n\nBaruch Spinoza also greatly contributes to the development of\nEnlightenment political philosophy in its early years. The\nmetaphysical doctrines of the Ethics (1677) lay the\ngroundwork for his influence on the age. Spinoza\u2019s arguments\nagainst Cartesian dualism and in favor of substance monism, the claim\nin particular that there can only be one substance, God or nature, was\ntaken to have radical implications in the domains of politics, ethics\nand religion throughout the period. Spinoza\u2019s employment of\nphilosophical reason leads to the denial of the existence of a\ntranscendent, creator, providential, law-giving God; this establishes\nthe opposition between the teachings of philosophy, on the one hand,\nand the traditional orienting practical beliefs (moral, religious,\npolitical) of the people, on the other hand, an opposition that is one\nimportant aspect of the culture of the Enlightenment. In his main\npolitical work, Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (1677),\nSpinoza, building on his rationalist naturalism, opposes superstition,\nargues for toleration and the subordination of religion to the state,\nand pronounces in favor of qualified democracy. Liberalism is perhaps\nthe most characteristic political philosophy of the Enlightenment, and\nSpinoza, in this text primarily, is one of its originators.\n\nHowever, John Locke\u2019s Second Treatise of\nGovernment (1690) is the classical source of modern liberal\npolitical theory. In his First Treatise of Government, Locke\nattacks Robert Filmer\u2019s Patriarcha (1680), which\nepitomizes the sort of political theory the Enlightenment opposes.\nFilmer defends the right of kings to exercise absolute authority over\ntheir subjects on the basis of the claim that they inherit the\nauthority God vested in Adam at creation. Though Locke\u2019s\nassertion of the natural freedom and equality of human beings in the\nSecond Treatise is starkly and explicitly opposed to\nFilmer\u2019s view, it is striking that the cosmology underlying\nLocke\u2019s assertions is closer to Filmer\u2019s than to\nSpinoza\u2019s. According to Locke, in order to understand the nature\nand source of legitimate political authority, we have to understand\nour relations in the state of nature. Drawing upon the natural law\ntradition, Locke argues that it is evident to our natural reason that\nwe are all absolutely subject to our Lord and Creator, but that, in\nrelation to each other, we exist naturally in a state of equality\n\u201cwherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one\nhaving more than another\u201d (Second Treatise, \u00a74).\nWe also exist naturally in a condition of freedom, insofar as we may\ndo with ourselves and our possessions as we please, within the\nconstraints of the fundamental law of nature. The law of nature\n\u201cteaches all mankind \u2026 that, being all equal and\nindependent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health,\nliberty, or possessions\u201d (\u00a76). That we are governed in our\nnatural condition by such a substantive moral law, legislated by God\nand known to us through our natural reason, implies that the state of\nnature is not Hobbes\u2019 war of all against all. However, since\nthere is lacking any human authority over all to judge of disputes and\nenforce the law, it is a condition marred by\n\u201cinconveniencies\u201d, in which possession of natural freedom,\nequality and possessions is insecure. According to Locke, we\nrationally quit this natural condition by contracting together to set\nover ourselves a political authority, charged with promulgating and\nenforcing a single, clear set of laws, for the sake of guaranteeing\nour natural rights, liberties and possessions. The civil, political\nlaw, founded ultimately upon the consent of the governed, does not\ncancel the natural law, according to Locke, but merely serves to draw\nthat law closer. \u201c[T]he law of nature stands as an eternal rule\nto all men\u201d (\u00a7135). Consequently, when established\npolitical power violates that law, the people are justified in\noverthrowing it. Locke\u2019s argument for the right to revolt\nagainst a government that opposes the purposes for which legitimate\ngovernment is taken by some to justify the political revolution in the\ncontext of which he writes (the English revolution) and, almost a\nhundred years later, by others to justify the American revolution as\nwell.\n\nThough Locke\u2019s liberalism has been tremendously influential, his\npolitical theory is founded on doctrines of natural law and religion\nthat are not nearly as evident as Locke assumes. Locke\u2019s\nreliance on the natural law tradition is typical of Enlightenment\npolitical and moral theory. According to the natural law tradition, as\nthe Enlightenment makes use of it, we can know through the use of our\nunaided reason that we all \u2013 all human beings, universally\n\u2013 stand in particular moral relations to each other. The claim\nthat we can apprehend through our unaided reason a universal\nmoral order exactly because moral qualities and relations (in\nparticular human freedom and equality) belong to the nature of things,\nis attractive in the Enlightenment for obvious reasons. However, as\nnoted above, the scientific apprehension of nature in the period does\nnot support, and in fact opposes, the claim that the alleged moral\nqualities and relations (or, indeed, that any moral qualities\nand relations) are natural. According to a common\nEnlightenment assumption, as humankind clarifies the laws of nature\nthrough the advance of natural science and philosophy, the true moral\nand political order will be revealed with it. This view is expressed\nexplicitly by the philosophe Marquis de Condorcet, in his\nSketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human\nMind (published posthumously in 1795 and which, perhaps better\nthan any other work, lays out the paradigmatically Enlightenment view\nof history of the human race as a continual progress to perfection).\nBut, in fact, advance in knowledge of the laws of nature in the\nscience of the period does not help with discernment of a natural\npolitical or moral order. This asserted relationship between natural\nscientific knowledge and the political and moral order is under great\nstress already in the Enlightenment. With respect to Lockean\nliberalism, though his assertion of the moral and political claims\n(natural freedom, equality, et cetera) continues to have considerable\nforce for us, the grounding of these claims in a religious cosmology\ndoes not. The question of how to ground our claims to natural freedom\nand equality is one of the main philosophical legacies of the\nEnlightenment.\n\nThe rise and development of liberalism in Enlightenment political\nthought has many relations with the rise of the mercantile class (the\nbourgeoisie) and the development of what comes to be called\n\u201ccivil society\u201d, the society characterized by work and\ntrade in pursuit of private property. Locke\u2019s Second\nTreatise contributes greatly to the project of articulating a\npolitical philosophy to serve the interests and values of this\nascending class. Locke claims that the end or purpose of political\nsociety is the preservation and protection of property (though he\ndefines property broadly to include not only external property but\nlife and liberties as well). According to Locke\u2019s famous\naccount, persons acquire rightful ownership in external things that\nare originally given to us all by God as a common inheritance,\nindependently of the state and prior to its involvement, insofar as we\n\u201cmix our labor with them\u201d. The civil freedom that Locke\ndefines, as something protected by the force of political laws, comes\nincreasingly to be interpreted as the freedom to trade, to exchange\nwithout the interference of governmental regulation. Within the\ncontext of the Enlightenment, economic freedom is a salient\ninterpretation of the individual freedom highly valued in the period.\nAdam Smith, a prominent member of the Scottish Enlightenment,\ndescribes in his An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the\nWealth of Nations (1776) some of the laws of civil society, as a\nsphere distinct from political society as such, and thus contributes\nsignificantly to the founding of political economy (later called\nmerely \u201ceconomics\u201d). His is one of many voices in the\nEnlightenment advocating for free trade and for minimal government\nregulation of markets. The trading house floor, in which people of\nvarious nationalities, languages, cultures, religions come together\nand trade, each in pursuit of his own self-interest, but, through this\npursuit, supplying the wants of their respective nations and\nincreasing its wealth, represents for some Enlightenment thinkers the\nbenign, peaceful, universal rational order that they wish to see\nreplace the violent, confessional strife that characterized the\nthen-recent past of Europe.\n\nHowever, the liberal conception of the government as properly\nprotecting economic freedom of citizens and private property comes\ninto conflict in the Enlightenment with the value of democracy. James\nMadison confronts this tension in the context of arguing for the\nadoption of the U.S. Constitution (in his Federalist #10). Madison\nargues that popular government (pure democracy) is subject to the evil\nof factions; in a pure democracy, a majority bound together by a\nprivate interest, relative to the whole, has the capacity to impose\nits particular will on the whole. The example most on Madison\u2019s\nmind is that those without property (the many) may seek to bring about\ngovernmental re-distribution of the property of the propertied class\n(the few), perhaps in the name of that other Enlightenment ideal,\nequality. If, as in Locke\u2019s theory, the government\u2019s\nprotection of an individual\u2019s freedom is encompassed within the\ngeneral end of protecting a person\u2019s property, then, as Madison\nargues, the proper form of the government cannot be pure democracy,\nand the will of the people must be officially determined in some other\nway than by directly polling the people.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s political theory, as presented in his\nOn the Social Contract (1762), presents a contrast to the\nLockean liberal model. Though commitment to the political ideals of\nfreedom and equality constitutes a common ground for Enlightenment\npolitical philosophy, it is not clear not only how these values have a\nhome in nature as Enlightenment science re-conceives it, but also how\nconcretely to interpret each of these ideals and how properly to\nbalance them against each other. Contrary to Madison, Rousseau argues\nthat direct (pure) democracy is the only form of government in which\nhuman freedom can be realized. Human freedom, according to\nRousseau\u2019s interpretation, is possible only through governance\naccording to what he calls \u201cthe general will,\u201d which is\nthe will of the body politic, formed through the original contract,\nconcretely determined in an assembly in which all citizens\nparticipate. Rousseau\u2019s account intends to avert the evils of\nfactions by structural elements of the original contract. The contract\nconsists in the self-alienation by each associate of all rights and\npossessions to the body politic. Because each alienates all, each is\nan equal member of the body politic, and the terms and conditions are\nthe same for all. The emergence of factions is avoided insofar as the\ngood of each citizen is, and is understood to be, equally (because\nwholly) dependent on the general will. Legislation supports this\nidentification with the general will by preserving the original\nequality established in the contract, prominently through maintaining\na measure of economic equality. Rousseau\u2019s account of the ideal\nrelation of the individual citizen to the state differs from\nLocke\u2019s; in Rousseau\u2019s account, the individual must be\nactively engaged in political life in order to maintain the\nidentification of his supremely authoritative will with the general\nwill, whereas in Locke the emphasis is on the limits of governmental\nauthority with respect to the expressions of the individual will.\nThough Locke\u2019s liberal model is more representative of the\nEnlightenment in general, Rousseau\u2019s political theory, which in\nsome respects presents a revived classical model modified within the\ncontext of Enlightenment values, in effect poses many of the enduring\nquestions regarding the meaning and interpretation of political\nfreedom and equality within the modern state.\n\nBoth Madison and Rousseau, like most political thinkers of the period,\nare influenced by Baron de Montesquieu\u2019s The Spirit of the\nLaws (1748), which is one of the founding texts of modern\npolitical theory. Though Montesquieu\u2019s treatise belongs to the\ntradition of liberalism in political theory, given his scientific\napproach to social, legal and political systems, his influence extends\nbeyond this tradition. Montesquieu argues that the system of\nlegislation for a people varies appropriately with the particular\ncircumstances of the people. He provides specific analysis of how\nclimate, fertility of the soil, population size, et cetera, affect\nlegislation. He famously distinguishes three main forms of\ngovernments: republics (which can either be democratic or\naristocratic), monarchies and despotisms. He describes leading\ncharacteristics of each. His argument that functional democracies\nrequire the population to possess civic virtue in high measure, a\nvirtue that consists in valuing public good above private interest,\ninfluences later Enlightenment theorists, including both Rousseau and\nMadison. He describes the threat of factions to which Madison and\nRousseau respond in different (indeed opposite) ways. He provides the\nbasic structure and justification for the balance of political powers\nthat Madison later incorporates into the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIt is striking how unenlightened many of the Enlightenment\u2019s\ncelebrated thinkers are concerning issues of race and of gender\n(regarding race, see Race and Enlightenment: A Reader, edited\nby Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze). For all the public concern with the\nallegedly universal \u201crights of man\u201d in the Enlightenment,\nthe rights of women and of non-white people are generally overlooked\nin the period. (Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s Vindication of the\nRights of Woman (1792) is a noteworthy exception.) When\nEnlightenment thinkers do turn their attention to the social standing\nof women or of non-white people, they tend to spout unreasoned\nprejudice. Moreover, while the philosophies of the Enlightenment\ngenerally aspire or pretend to universal truth, unattached to\nparticular time, place or culture, Enlightenment writings are rife\nwith rank ethno- and Eurocentrism, often explicit.\n\nIn the face of such tensions within the Enlightenment, one response is\nto affirm the power of the Enlightenment to improve humanity and\nsociety long beyond the end of the eighteenth century, indeed, down to\nthe present day and into the future. This response embraces the\nEnlightenment and interprets more recent emancipation movements and\nachievement of recognition of the rights and dignity of traditionally\noppressed and marginalized groups as expressions of Enlightenment\nideals and aspirations. Critics of the Enlightenment respond\ndifferently to such tensions. Critics see them as symptoms of\ndisorder, ideology, perversity, futility or falsehood that afflict the\nvery core of the Enlightenment itself. (See James Schmidt\u2019s\n\u201cWhat Enlightenment Project?\u201d for discussion of critics of\nthe Enlightenment.) Famously, Adorno and Horkheimer interpret Nazi\ndeath camps as the result of \u201cthe dialectic of the\nEnlightenment\u201d, as what historically becomes of the supremacy of\ninstrumental reason asserted in the Enlightenment. As another example,\nwe may point to some post-modern feminists, who argue, in opposition\nto the liberal feminists who embrace broadly Enlightenment ideals and\nconceptions, that the essentialism and universalism associated with\nEnlightenment ideals are both false and intrinsically hostile to the\naspirations to self-realization of women and of other traditionally\noppressed groups. (See Strickland and the essays in Akkerman and\nStuurman.) This entry is not the place to delineate strains of\nopposition to the Enlightenment, but it is worth noting that\npost-Enlightenment social and political struggles to achieve equality\nor recognition for traditionally marginalized or oppressed groups are\nsometimes self-consciously grounded in the Enlightenment and sometimes\nmarked by explicit opposition to the Enlightenment\u2019s conceptions\nor presuppositions.\n2.2 Ethical Theory\n\nMany of the leading issues and positions of contemporary philosophical\nethics take shape within the Enlightenment. Prior to the Enlightenment\nin the West, ethical reflection begins from and orients itself around\nreligious doctrines concerning God and the afterlife. The highest good\nof humanity, and, accordingly, the content and grounding of moral\nduties, are conceived in immediately religious terms. During the\nEnlightenment, this changes, certainly within philosophy, but to some\nsignificant degree, within the population of western society at large.\nAs the processes of industrialization, urbanization, and dissemination\nof education advance in this period, happiness in this life, rather\nthan union with God in the next, becomes the highest end for more and\nmore people. Also, the violent religious wars that bloody Europe in\nthe early modern period motivate the development of secular,\nthis-worldly ethics, insofar as they indicate the failure of religious\ndoctrines concerning God and the afterlife to establish a stable\nfoundation for ethics. In the Enlightenment, philosophical thinkers\nconfront the problem of developing ethical systems on a secular,\nbroadly naturalistic basis for the first time since the rise of\nChristianity eclipsed the great classical ethical systems. However,\nthe changes in our understanding of nature and cosmology, effected by\nmodern natural science, make recourse to the systems of Plato and\nAristotle problematic. The Platonic identification of the good with\nthe real and the Aristotelian teleological understanding of natural\nthings are both difficult to square with the Enlightenment conception\nof nature. The general philosophical problem emerges in the\nEnlightenment of how to understand the source and grounding of ethical\nduties, and how to conceive the highest good for human beings, within\na secular, broadly naturalistic context, and within the context of a\ntransformed understanding of the natural world.\n\nIn ethical thought, as in political theory, Hobbes\u2019 thought is\nan important provocation in the Enlightenment. Hobbes understands what\nis good, as the end of human action, to be \u201cwhatsoever is the\nobject of any man\u2019s appetite or desire,\u201d and evil to be\n\u201cthe object of his hate, and aversion,\u201d \u201cthere being\nnothing simply and absolutely so; nor any common rule of good and\nevil, to be taken from the nature of the objects themselves\u201d\n(Leviathan, chapter 6). Hobbes\u2019 conception of human\nbeings as fundamentally motivated by their perception of what is in\ntheir own best interest implies the challenge, important for\nEnlightenment moral philosophy, to construct moral duties of justice\nand benevolence out of such limited materials. The basis of human\naction that Hobbes posits is immediately intelligible and even shared\nwith other animals to some extent; a set of moral duties constructed\non this basis would also be intelligible, de-mystified, and fit within\nthe larger scheme of nature. Bernard Mandeville is sometimes grouped\nwith Hobbes in the Enlightenment, especially by critics of them both,\nbecause he too, in his popular Fable of the Bees; or, Private\nVices, Public Benefits (1714), sees people as fundamentally\nmotivated by their perceived self-interest, and then undertakes to\ntell a story about how moral virtue, which involves conquering\none\u2019s own appetite and serving the interests of others, can be\nunderstood to arise on this basis.\n\nSamuel Clarke, an influential rationalist British thinker early in the\nEnlightenment, undertakes to show in his Discourse concerning the\nUnchangeable Obligations of Natural Religion (1706), against\nHobbes, that the absolute difference between moral good and moral evil\nlies in the immediately discernible nature of things, independently of\nany compacts or positive legislation by God or human beings. Clarke\nwrites that \u201cin men\u2019s dealing \u2026 one with another,\nit is undeniably more fit, absolutely and in the nature of the thing\nitself, that all men should endeavor to promote the universal good and\nwelfare of all; than that all men should be continually contriving the\nruin and destruction of all\u201d. Likewise for the rest of what\nmorality enjoins upon us. According to Clarke, that some actions\n(those we call morally good or required) are \u201cfit to be\ndone\u201d and others not fit is grounded upon the immediately\nevident relations in which things stand to each other in nature, just\nas \u201cthe proportions of lines or numbers\u201d are evident to\nthe rational perception of a reasonable being. Similarly, Christian\nWolff\u2019s rationalist practical philosophy also grounds moral\nduties in an objective rational order. However, the objective quality\non which moral requirements are grounded for Wolff is not the\n\u201cfitness\u201d of things to be done but rather their\nperfection. Wolff counts as a founder of the Aufkl\u00e4rung\nin part because of his attempted derivation of ethical duties from an\norder of perfection in things, discernable through reason,\nindependently of divine commands.\n\nRationalist ethics so conceived faces the following obstacles in the\nEnlightenment. First, as implied above, it becomes increasingly\nimplausible that the objective, mind-independent order is really as\nrationalist ethicists claim it to be. Second, even if the objective\nrealm were ordered as the rationalist claims, it remains unclear how\nthis order gives rise (on its own, as it were) to obligations binding\non our wills. David Hume famously exposes the fallacy of deriving a\nprescriptive statement (that one ought to perform some action) from a\ndescription of how things stand in relation to each other in nature.\nPrima facie, there is a gap between the rationalist\u2019s objective\norder and a set of prescriptions binding on our wills; if a supreme\nlegislator must be re-introduced in order to make the conformity of\nour actions to that objective order binding on our wills, then the\nalleged existence of the objective moral order does not do the work\nthe account asks of it in the first place.\n\nAlongside the rationalist strand of ethical philosophy in the\nEnlightenment, there is also a very significant empiricist strand.\nEmpirical accounts of moral virtue in the period are distinguished,\nboth by grounding moral virtue on an empirical study of human nature,\nand by grounding cognition of moral duties and moral motivation in\nhuman sensibility, rather than in reason. The Third Earl of\nShaftesbury, author of the influential work Characteristics of\nMen, Manners, Opinions, Times (1711), is a founding figure of the\nempiricist strand. Shaftesbury, like Clarke, is provoked by\nHobbes\u2019 egoism to provide a non-egoistic account of moral\nvirtue. Shaftesbury conceives the core notion of the goodness of\nthings teleologically: something is good if it contributes to the\nwell-being or furtherance of the system of which it is a part.\nIndividual animals are members of species, and therefore they are good\nas such insofar as they contribute to the well-being of the species of\nwhich they are a part. Thus, the good of things, including human\nbeings, for Shaftesbury as for Clarke, is an objective quality that is\nknowable through reason. However, though we can know what is good\nthrough reason, Shaftesbury maintains that reason alone is not\nsufficient to motivate human action. Shaftesbury articulates the\nstructure of a distinctively human moral sensibility. Moral\nsensibility depends on the faculty of reflection. When we reflect on\nfirst-order passions such as gratitude, kindness and pity, we find\nourselves approving or liking them and disapproving or disliking their\nopposites. By virtue of our receptivity to such feelings, we are\ncapable of virtue and have a sense of right and wrong. In this way,\nShaftesbury defines the moral sense that plays a significant role in\nthe theories of subsequent Enlightenment thinkers such as Francis\nHutcheson and David Hume.\n\nIn the rationalist tradition, the conflict within the breast of the\nperson between the requirements of morality and self-interest is\ncanonically a conflict between the person\u2019s reason and her\npassions. Shaftesbury\u2019s identification of a moral sentiment in\nthe nature of humanity renders this a conflict within sensibility\nitself, a conflict between different sentiments, between a\nself-interested sentiment and an unegoistic sentiment. Though both\nShaftesbury and Hutcheson, no less than Clarke, oppose Hobbes\u2019s\negoism, it is nonetheless true that the doctrine of moral sensibility\nsoftens moral demands, so to speak. Doing what is morally right or\nmorally good is intrinsically bound up with a distinctive kind of\npleasure on their accounts. It is significant that both Shaftesbury\nand Hutcheson, the two founders of modern moral sense theory,\narticulate their ethical theory in conjunction with an aesthetic\ntheory. Arguably the pleasure we feel in the apprehension of something\nbeautiful is disinterested pleasure. Our susceptibility to\naesthetic pleasure can be taken to reveal that we apprehend and\nrespond to objective (or, anyway, universal) values, not only or\nnecessarily on the basis of reason, but through our natural\nsensibility instead. Thus, aesthetics, as Shaftesbury and Hutcheson\nindependently develop an account of it, gives encouragement to their\ndoctrines of moral sensibility. But an account of moral virtue, unlike\naesthetics, requires an account of moral motivation. As noted\nabove, both Shaftesbury and Hutcheson want to do justice to the idea\nthat proper moral motivation is not the pursuit of pleasure, even\ndisinterested pleasure, but rather an immediate response to the\nperception of moral value. The problem of giving a satisfying account\nof moral motivation is a difficult one for empiricist moral\nphilosophers in the Enlightenment.\n\nWhile for Shaftesbury, at the beginning of the moral sense tradition,\nmoral sense tracks a mind-independent order of value, David Hume,\nmotivated in part by a more radical empiricism, is happy to let the\nobjective order go. We have no access through reason to an independent\norder of value which moral sense would track. For Hume, morality is\nfounded completely on our sentiments. Hume is often regarded as the\nmain originator of so-called \u201cethical subjectivism\u201d,\naccording to which moral judgments or evaluations (regarding actions\nor character) do not make claims about independent facts but merely\nexpress the subject\u2019s feelings or attitudes with respect to\nactions or character. Such subjectivism is relieved of the difficult\ntask of explaining how the objective order of values belongs to the\nnatural world as it is being reconceived by natural science in the\nperiod; however, it faces the challenge of explaining how error and\ndisagreement in moral judgments and evaluations are possible.\nHume\u2019s account of the standards of moral judgment follows that\nof Hutcheson in relying centrally on the \u201cnatural\u201d\nresponses of an ideal observer or spectator.\n\nHume\u2019s ethics is exemplary of philosophical ethics in the\nEnlightenment by virtue of its belonging to the attempt to provide a\nnew, empirically grounded science of human nature, free of theological\npresuppositions. As noted above, the attempts by the members of the\nFrench Enlightenment to present a new understanding of human nature\nare strongly influenced by Locke\u2019s \u201csensationalism\u201d,\nwhich, radicalized by Condillac, amounts to the attempt to base all\ncontents and faculties of the human mind on the senses. Typically, the\nFrench philosophes draw more radical or iconoclastic\nimplications from the new \u201cscience of man\u201d than English or\nScottish Enlightenment figures. Claude-Adrien Helv\u00e9tius\n(1715\u20131771) is typical here. In De\nl\u2019\u00e9sprit (1758), Helv\u00e9tius follows the\nLockean sensationalism of Condillac and pairs it with the claim that\nhuman beings are motivated in their actions only by the natural desire\nto maximize their own pleasure and minimize their pain. De\nl\u2019\u00e9sprit, though widely read, gives rise to strong\nnegative reactions in the time, both by political and religious\nauthorities (the Sorbonne, the Pope and the Parlement of Paris all\ncondemn the book) and by prominent fellow philosophes, in\ngreat part because Helv\u00e9tius\u2019s psychology seems to\ncritics to render moral imperatives and values without basis, despite\nhis best attempts to derive them. Helv\u00e9tius attempts to ground\nthe moral equality of all human beings by portraying all human beings,\nwhatever their standing in the social hierarchy, whatever their\nspecial talents and gifts, as equally products of the nature we share\nplus the variable influences of education and social environment. But,\nto critics, Helv\u00e9tius\u2019s account portrays all human beings\nas equal only by virtue of portraying all as equally worthless\n(insofar as the claim to equality is grounded on all being equally\ndetermined by external factors). However, Helv\u00e9tius\u2019s\nideas, in De l\u2019\u00e9sprit as well as in its\nposthumously published sequel De l\u2019homme (1772), exert\na great deal of influence, especially his case for the role of\npleasure and pain in human motivation and the role of education and\nsocial incentives in shaping individuals into contributors to the\nsocial good. Helv\u00e9tius is sometimes regarded as the father of\nmodern utilitarianism through his articulation of the greatest\nhappiness principle and through his influence on Bentham.\n\nHelv\u00e9tius is typical in the respect that he is radical in the\nrevisions he proposes, not in common moral judgments or customs of the\ntime, but rather regarding the philosophical grounding of those\njudgments and customs. But there are some philosophers in the\nEnlightenment who are radical in the revisions they propose regarding\nthe content of ethical judgments themselves. The Marquis de Sade is\nmerely the most notorious example, among a set of Enlightenment\nfigures (including also the Marquis de Argens and Diderot himself in\nsome of his writings) who, within the context of the new naturalism\nand its emphasis on the pursuit of pleasure, celebrate the avid\npursuit of sexual pleasure and explicitly challenge the sexual mores,\nas well as the wider morality, of their time. The more or less\nfictionalized, philosophically self-conscious \u201clibertine\u201d\nis one significant expression of Enlightenment ethical thought.\n\nIf the French Enlightenment tends to advance this-worldly happiness as\nthe highest good for human beings more insistently than the\nEnlightenment elsewhere, then Rousseau\u2019s voice is, in this as in\nother respects, a discordant voice in that context. Rousseau advances\nthe cultivation and realization of human freedom as the\nhighest end for human beings and thereby gives expression to another\nside of Enlightenment ethics. As Rousseau describes it, the capacity\nfor individual self-determination puts us in a problematic relation to\nour natural desires and inclinations and to the realm of nature\ngenerally, insofar as that realm is constituted by mechanistic\ncausation. Though Rousseau places a great deal of emphasis on human\nfreedom, and makes significant contributions to our understanding of\nourselves as free, he does not address very seriously the problem of\nthe place of human freedom in the cosmos as it is conceived within the\ncontext of Enlightenment naturalism.\n\nHowever, Rousseau\u2019s writings help Kant to the articulation of a\npractical philosophy that addresses many of the tensions in the\nEnlightenment. Kant follows Rousseau, and disagrees with empiricism in\nethics in the period, in emphasizing human freedom, rather than human\nhappiness, as the central orienting concept of practical philosophy.\nThough Kant presents the moral principle as a principle of practical\nreason, his ethics also disagrees significantly with rationalist\nethics in the period. According to Kant, rationalists such as Wolff,\ninsofar as they take moral prescriptions to follow from an end given\nto the will (in Wolff\u2019s case, the end of perfection), do not\nunderstand us as autonomous in our moral activity. Through\ninterpreting the faculty of the will itself as practical reason, Kant\nunderstands the moral principle as internally legislated, thus as not\nonly compatible with freedom, but as equivalent to the principle of a\nfree will, as a principle of autonomy. As noted above, rationalists in\nethics in the period are challenged to explain how the objective moral\norder which reason in us allegedly discerns gives rise to valid\nprescriptions binding on our wills (the gap between is and\nought). For Kant, the moral order is not independent of our\nwill, but rather represents the formal constraints of willing as such.\nKant\u2019s account thus both avoids the is-ought gap and interprets\nmoral willing as expressive of our freedom.\n\nMoreover, by virtue of his interpretation of the moral principle as\nthe principle of pure practical reason, Kant is able to redeem the\nordinary sense of moral requirements as over-riding, as potentially\nopposed to the claims of one\u2019s happiness, and thus as different\nin kind from the deliverances of prudential reasoning. This ordinary\nsense of moral requirements is not easily accommodated within the\ncontext of Enlightenment empiricism and naturalism. Kant\u2019s stark\ndichotomy between a person\u2019s practical reason and her sensible\nnature is strongly criticized, both by the subsequent Romantic\ngeneration and in the contemporary context; but this dichotomy is\nbound up with an important benefit of Kant\u2019s view \u2013 much\npromoted by Kant himself \u2013 within the context of the\nEnlightenment. Elaborated in the context of Kant\u2019s idealism as a\ncontrast between the \u201crealm of freedom\u201d and the\n\u201crealm of nature\u201d, the dichotomy enables Kant\u2019s\nproposed solution to the conflict between freedom and nature that\nbesets Enlightenment thought. As noted above, Kant argues that the\napplication of the causal principle is restricted to the realm of\nnature, thus making room for freedom, compatibly with the causal\ndetermination of natural events required by scientific knowledge.\nAdditionally, Kant attempts to show that morality \u201cleads\nineluctably to\u201d religious belief (in the supersensible objects\nof God and of the immortal soul) while being essentially not founded\non religious belief, thus again vindicating the ordinary understanding\nof morality while still furthering Enlightenment values and\ncommitments.\n2.3 Religion and the Enlightenment\n\nThough the Enlightenment is sometimes represented as the enemy of\nreligion, it is more accurate to see it as critically directed against\nvarious (arguably contingent) features of religion, such as\nsuperstition, enthusiasm, fanaticism and supernaturalism. Indeed the\neffort to discern and advocate for a religion purified of such\nfeatures \u2013 a \u201crational\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d\nreligion \u2013 is more typical of the Enlightenment than opposition\nto religion as such. Even Voltaire, who is perhaps the most\npersistent, powerful, vocal Enlightenment critic of religion, directs\nhis polemic mostly against the Catholic Church in France \u2013\n\u201cl\u2019inf\u00e2me\u201d in his famous sign-off in\nhis letters, \u201c\u00c9crasez\nl\u2019inf\u00e2me\u201d (\u201cCrush the infamous\u201d)\nrefers to the Church, not to religion as such. However, controversy\nregarding the truth-value or reasonableness of religious belief in\ngeneral, Christian belief in particular, and controversy regarding the\nproper place of religion in society, occupies a particularly central\nplace in the Enlightenment. It\u2019s as if the terrible, violent\nconfessional strife in the early modern period in Europe, the bloody\ndrawn-out wars between the Christian sects, was removed to the\nintellectual arena in the Enlightenment and became a set of more\ngeneral philosophical controversies.\n\nAlongside the rise of the new science, the rise of Protestantism in\nwestern Christianity also plays an important role in generating the\nEnlightenment. The original Protestants assert a sort of individual\nliberty with respect to questions of faith against the paternalistic\nauthority of the Church. The \u201cliberty of conscience\u201d, so\nimportant to Enlightenment thinkers in general, and asserted against\nall manner of paternalistic authorities (including Protestant),\ndescends from this Protestant assertion. The original Protestant\nassertion initiates a crisis of authority regarding religious belief,\na crisis of authority that, expanded and generalized and even, to some\nextent, secularized, becomes a central characteristic of the\nEnlightenment spirit. The original Protestant assertion against the\nCatholic Church bases itself upon the authority of scripture. However,\nin the Enlightenment, the authority of scripture is strongly\nchallenged, especially when taken literally. Developing natural\nscience renders acceptance of a literal version of the Bible\nincreasingly untenable. But authors such as Spinoza (in his\nTractatus Theologico-Politicus) present ways of interpreting\nscripture according to its spirit, rather than its letter, in order to\npreserve its authority and truth, thus contributing to the\nEnlightenment controversy of whether some rationally purified version\nof the religion handed down in the culture belongs to the true\nphilosophical representation of the world or not; and, if so, what its\ncontent is.\n\nIt is convenient to discuss religion in the Enlightenment by\npresenting four characteristic forms of Enlightenment religion in\nturn: deism, religion of the heart, fideism and atheism.\n\nDeism. Deism is the form of religion most associated with the\nEnlightenment. According to deism, we can know by the natural light of\nreason that the universe is created and governed by a supreme\nintelligence; however, although this supreme being has a plan for\ncreation from the beginning, the being does not interfere with\ncreation; the deist typically rejects miracles and reliance on special\nrevelation as a source of religious doctrine and belief, in favor of\nthe natural light of reason. Thus, a deist typically rejects the\ndivinity of Christ, as repugnant to reason; the deist typically\ndemotes the figure of Jesus from agent of miraculous redemption to\nextraordinary moral teacher. Deism is the form of religion fitted to\nthe new discoveries in natural science, according to which the cosmos\ndisplays an intricate machine-like order; the deists suppose that the\nsupposition of God is necessary as the source or author of this order.\nThough not a deist himself, Isaac Newton provides fuel for deism with\nhis argument in his Opticks (1704) that we must infer from\nthe order and beauty in the world to the existence of an intelligent\nsupreme being as the cause of this order and beauty. Samuel Clarke,\nperhaps the most important proponent and popularizer of Newtonian\nphilosophy in the early eighteenth century, supplies some of the more\ndeveloped arguments for the position that the correct exercise of\nunaided human reason leads inevitably to the well-grounded belief in\nGod. He argues that the Newtonian physical system implies the\nexistence of a transcendent cause, the creator God. In his first set\nof Boyle lectures, A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of\nGod (1705), Clarke presents the metaphysical or \u201cargument\na priori\u201d for God\u2019s existence. This argument\nconcludes from the rationalist principle that whatever exists must\nhave a sufficient reason or cause of its existence to the existence of\na transcendent, necessary being who stands as the cause of the chain\nof natural causes and effects. Clarke also supports the empirical\nargument from design, the argument that concludes from the evidence of\norder in nature to the existence of an intelligent author of that\norder. In his second set of Boyle lectures, A Discourse Concerning\nthe Unchangeable Obligations of Natural Religion (1706), Clarke\nargues as well that the moral order revealed to us by our natural\nreason requires the existence of a divine legislator and an afterlife,\nin which the supreme being rewards virtue and punishes vice. In his\nBoyle lectures, Clarke argues directly against the deist philosophy\nand maintains that what he regards as the one true religion,\nChristianity, is known as such on the basis of miracles and special\nrevelation; still, Clarke\u2019s arguments on the topic of natural\nreligion are some of the best and most widely-known arguments in the\nperiod for the general deist position that natural philosophy in a\nbroad sense grounds central doctrines of a universal religion.\n\nEnlightenment deism first arises in England. In On the\nReasonableness of Christianity (1695), Locke aims to establish\nthe compatibility of reason and the teachings of Christianity. Though\nLocke himself is (like Newton, like Clarke) not a deist, the major\nEnglish deists who follow (John Toland, Christianity Not\nMysterious [1696]); Anthony Collins, A Discourse of\nFreethinking [1713]; Matthew Tindal, Christianity as Old as\nCreation [1730]) are influenced by Locke\u2019s work. Voltaire\ncarries deism across the channel to France and advocates for it there\nover his long literary career. Toward the end-stage, the farcical\nstage, of the French Revolution, Robespierre institutes a form of\ndeism, the so-called \u201cCult of the Supreme Being\u201d, as the\nofficial religion of the French state. Deism plays a role in the\nfounding of the American republic as well. Many of the founding\nfathers (Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, Paine) author statements or\ntracts that are sympathetic to deism; and their deistic sympathies\ninfluence the place given (or not given) to religion in the new\nAmerican state that they found.\n\nReligion of the Heart. Opposition to deism derives sometimes\nfrom the perception of it as coldly rationalistic. The God of the\ndeists, arrived at through a priori or empirical argument and referred\nto as the Prime Mover or Original Architect, is often perceived as\ndistant and unconcerned with the daily struggles of human existence,\nand thus as not answering the human needs from which religion springs\nin the first place. Some important thinkers of the Enlightenment\n\u2013 notably Shaftesbury and Rousseau \u2013 present religion as\nfounded on natural human sentiments, rather than on the operations of\nthe intellect. Rousseau has his Savoyard Vicar declare, in his\nProfession of Faith in Emile (1762), that the idea of\nworshiping a beneficent deity arose in him initially as he reflected\non his own situation in nature and his \u201cheart began to glow with\na sense of gratitude towards the author of our being\u201d. The\nSavoyard Vicar continues: \u201cI adore the supreme power, and melt\ninto tenderness at his goodness. I have no need to be taught\nartificial forms of worship; the dictates of nature are sufficient. Is\nit not a natural consequence of self-love to honor those who protect\nus, and to love such as do us good?\u201d This \u201cnatural\u201d\nreligion \u2013 opposed to the \u201cartificial\u201d religions\nenforced in the institutions \u2013 is often classed as a form of\ndeism. But it deserves separate mention, because of its grounding in\nnatural human sentiments, rather than in reason or in metaphysical or\nnatural scientific problems of cosmology.\n\nFideism. Deism or natural religion of various sorts tends to\nrely on the claim that reason or human experience supports the\nhypothesis that there is a supreme being who created or authored the\nworld. In one of the most important philosophical texts on natural\nreligion to appear during the Enlightenment, David Hume\u2019s\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion (published posthumously\nin 1779), this supposition is criticized relentlessly, incisively and\nin detail. Naturally, the critical, questioning attitude\ncharacteristic of the Enlightenment in general is directed against the\narguments on which natural religion is based. In Part Nine of the\nDialogues, Samuel Clarke\u2019s \u201cargument a\npriori\u201d (as defended by the character Demea) is dispatched\nfairly quickly, but with a battery of arguments. But Hume is mainly\nconcerned in the Dialogues with the other major pillar of\nnatural religion in the Enlightenment, the \u201cempirical\u201d\nargument, the teleological argument or the argument from design.\nCleanthes, the character who advances the design argument in the\ndialogue, proceeds from the rule for empirical reasoning that like\neffects prove like causes. He reasons that, given the resemblance\nbetween nature, which displays in many respects a \u201ccurious\nadaptation of means to ends\u201d, and a man-made machine, we must\ninfer the cause of nature to be an intelligence like ours, though\ngreater in proportion as nature surpasses in perfection the products\nof human intelligence. Philo, the skeptical voice in the\nDialogues, presses Cleanthes\u2019 argument on many fronts.\nHe points out that the argument is only as strong as the similarity\nbetween nature or parts of nature and man-made machines, and further,\nthat a close scrutiny reveals that analogy to be weak. Moreover,\naccording to the principle of the argument, the stronger the evidence\nfor an author (or authors) of nature, the more like us that\nauthor (or authors) should be taken to be. Consequently, according to\nPhilo, the argument does not support the conclusion that God\nexists, taking God to be unitary, infinite, perfect, et cetera. Also,\nalthough the existence of evil and disorder in nature may serve\nactually to strengthen the case for the argument, given the disorder\nin human creations as well, the notion that God authors evil and\ndisorder is disturbing. If one denies that there is disorder and evil\nin nature, however implausibly, the effect is to emphasize again the\ndissimilarity between nature and human products and thus weaken the\ncentral basis of the argument. With these and other considerations,\nPhilo puts the proponent of the empirical argument in a difficult\ndialectical position. But Cleanthes is not moved. He holds the\ninference from the phenomenon of the curious adaptation of means to\nends in nature to the existence of an intelligent and beneficent\nauthor to be so natural as to be impervious to the philosophical\ncavils raised by Philo. And, in the ambiguous conclusion of the work,\nPhilo seems to agree. Though Hume himself seems to have been an\natheist, one natural way to take the upshot of his Dialogues\nis that religious belief is so \u201cnatural\u201d to us that\nrational criticism cannot unseat it. The ambiguous upshot of the work\ncan be taken to be the impotence of rational criticism in the face of\nreligious belief, rather than the illegitimacy of religious belief in\nthe face of rational criticism. This tends toward fideism, the view\naccording to which religious faith maintains its truth over against\nphilosophical reasoning, which opposes but cannot defeat it. Fideism\nis most often associated with thinkers whose beliefs run contrary to\nthe trends of the Enlightenment (Blaise Pascal, Johann-Georg Hamann,\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard), but the skeptical strain in the\nEnlightenment, from Pierre Bayle through David Hume, expresses itself\nnot only in atheism, but also in fideism.\n\nAtheism. Atheism is more present in the French Enlightenment\nthan elsewhere. In the writings of Denis Diderot, atheism is partly\nsupported by an expansive, dynamic conception of nature. According to\nthe viewpoint developed by Diderot, we ought to search for the\nprinciples of natural order within natural processes themselves, not\nin a supernatural being. Even if we don\u2019t yet know the internal\nprinciples for the ordering and development of natural forms, the\nappeal to a transcendent author of such things is reminiscent, to\nDiderot\u2019s ear, of the appeal to Aristotelian \u201csubstantial\nforms\u201d that was expressly rejected at the beginning of modern\nscience as explaining nothing. The appeal to a transcendent author\ndoes not extend our understanding, but merely marks and fixes the\nlimits of it. Atheism (combined with materialism) in the French\nEnlightenment is perhaps most identified with the Baron\nd\u2019Holbach, whose System of Nature (1770) generated a\ngreat deal of controversy at the time for urging the case for atheism\nexplicitly and emphatically. D\u2019Holbach\u2019s system of nature\nis strongly influenced by Diderot\u2019s writings, though it displays\nless subtlety and dialectical sophistication. Though most\nEnlightenment thinkers hold that morality requires religion, in the\nsense that morality requires belief in a transcendent law-giver and in\nan after-life, d\u2019Holbach (influenced in this respect by Spinoza,\namong others) makes the case for an ethical naturalism, an ethics that\nis free of any reference to a supernatural grounding or aspiration.\nLike Helv\u00e9tius before him, d\u2019Holbach presents an ethics\nin which virtue consists in enlightened self-interest. The\nmetaphysical background of the ethics he presents is deterministic\nmaterialism. The Prussian enlightened despot, Frederick the Great,\nfamously criticizes d\u2019Holbach\u2019s book for exemplifying the\nincoherence that troubles the Enlightenment generally: while\nd\u2019Holbach provides passionate moral critiques of existing\nreligious and social and political institutions and practices, his own\nmaterialist, determinist conception of nature allows no place for\nmoral \u201coughts\u201d and prescriptions and values.\n3. The Beautiful: Aesthetics in the Enlightenment\n\nModern systematic philosophical aesthetics not only first emerges in\nthe context of the Enlightenment, but also flowers brilliantly there.\nAs Ernst Cassirer notes, the eighteenth century not only thinks of\nitself as the \u201ccentury of philosophy\u201d, but also as\n\u201cthe age of criticism,\u201d where criticism is centrally\n(though not only) art and literary criticism (Cassirer 1932, 255).\nPhilosophical aesthetics flourishes in the period because of its\nstrong affinities with the tendencies of the age. Alexander\nBaumgarten, the German philosopher in the school of Christian Wolff,\nfounds systematic aesthetics in the period, in part through giving it\nits name. \u201cAesthetics\u201d is derived from the Greek word for\n\u201csenses\u201d, because for Baumgarten a science of the\nbeautiful would be a science of the sensible, a science of sensible\ncognition. The Enlightenment in general re-discovers the value of the\nsenses, not only in cognition, but in human lives in general, and so,\ngiven the intimate connection between beauty and human sensibility,\nthe Enlightenment is naturally particularly interested in aesthetics.\nAlso, the Enlightenment includes a general recovery and affirmation of\nthe value of pleasure in human lives, against the tradition of\nChristian asceticism, and the flourishing of the arts, of the\ncriticism of the arts and of the philosophical theorizing about\nbeauty, promotes and is promoted by this recovery and affirmation. The\nEnlightenment also enthusiastically embraces the discovery and\ndisclosure of rational order in nature, as manifest most clearly in\nthe development of the new science. It seems to many theorists in the\nEnlightenment that the faculty of taste, the faculty by which we\ndiscern beauty, reveals to us some part of this order, a distinctive\nharmony, unities amidst variety. Thus, in the phenomenon of aesthetic\npleasure, human sensibility discloses to us rational order, thus\nbinding together two enthusiasms of the Enlightenment.\n3.1 French Classicism and German Rationalism\n\nIn the early Enlightenment, especially in France, the emphasis is upon\nthe discernment of an objective rational order, rather than upon the\nsubject\u2019s sensual aesthetic pleasure. Though Descartes\u2019\nphilosophical system does not include a theory of taste or of beauty,\nhis mathematical model of the physical universe inspires the\naesthetics of French classicism. French classicism begins from the\nclassical maxim that the beautiful is the true. Nicolas Boileau writes\nin his influential didactic poem, The Art of Poetry (1674),\nin which he lays down rules for good versification within different\ngenres, that \u201cNothing is beautiful but the true, the true alone\nis lovable.\u201d In the period the true is conceived of as an\nobjective rational order. According to the classical conception of art\nthat dominates in the period, art imitates nature, though not\nnature as given in disordered experience, but the ideal\nnature, the ideal in which we can discern and enjoy \u201cunity in\nmultiplicity.\u201d In French classicism, aesthetics is very much\nunder the influence of, and indeed modeled on, systematic, rigorous\ntheoretical science of nature. Just as in Descartes\u2019 model of\nscience, where knowledge of all particulars depends on prior knowledge\nof the principle from which the particulars are deduced, so also in\nthe aesthetics of French classicism, the demand is for systematization\nunder a single, universal principle. The subjection of artistic\nphenomena to universal rules and principles is expressed, for example,\nin the title of Charles Batteaux\u2019s main work, The Fine Arts\nReduced to a Single Principle (1746), as well as in\nBoileau\u2019s rules for good versification.\n\nIn Germany in the eighteenth century, Christian Wolff\u2019s\nsystematic rationalist metaphysics forms the basis for much of the\nreflection on aesthetics, though sometimes as a set of doctrines to be\nargued against. Wolff affirms the classical dictum that beauty is\ntruth; beauty is truth perceived through the feeling of pleasure.\nWolff understands beauty to consist in the perfection in things, which\nhe understands in turn to consist in a harmony or order of a manifold.\nWe judge something beautiful through a feeling of pleasure when we\nsense in it this harmony or perfection. Beauty is, for Wolff, the\nsensitive cognition of perfection. Thus, for Wolff, beauty corresponds\nto objective features of the world, but judgments of beauty are\nrelative to us also, insofar as they are based on the human faculty of\nsensibility.\n3.2 Empiricism and Subjectivism\n\nThough philosophical rationalism forms the basis of aesthetics in the\nearly Enlightenment in France and Germany, thinkers in the empiricist\ntradition in England and Scotland introduce many of the salient themes\nof Enlightenment aesthetics. In particular, with the rise of\nempiricism and subjectivism in this domain, attention shifts to the\nground and nature of the subject\u2019s experience of beauty, the\nsubject\u2019s aesthetic response. Lord Shaftesbury, though not\nhimself an empiricist or subjectivist in aesthetics, makes significant\ncontributions to this development. Shaftesbury re-iterates the\nclassical equation, \u201call beauty is truth,\u201d but the truth\nthat beauty is for Shaftesbury is not an objective rational order that\ncould also be known conceptually. Though beauty is, for Shaftesbury, a\nkind of harmony that is independent of the human mind, under the\ninfluence of Plotinus, he understands the human being\u2019s\nimmediate intuition of the beautiful as a kind of participation in the\noriginal harmony. Shaftesbury focuses attention on the nature of the\nsubject\u2019s response to beauty, as elevating the person, also\nmorally. He maintains that aesthetic response consists in a\ndisinterested unegoistic pleasure; the discovery of this\ncapacity for disinterested pleasure in harmony shows the way for the\ndevelopment of his ethics that has a similar grounding. And, in fact,\nin seeing aesthetic response as elevating oneself above\nself-interested pursuits, through cultivating one\u2019s receptivity\nto disinterested pleasure, Shaftesbury ties tightly together\naesthetics and ethics, morality and beauty, and in that respect also\ncontributes to a trend of the period. Also, in placing the emphasis on\nthe subject\u2019s response to beauty, rather than on the objective\ncharacteristics of the beautiful, Shaftesbury makes aesthetics belong\nto the general Enlightenment interest in human nature. Thinkers of the\nperiod find in our receptivity to beauty a key both to understanding\nboth distinctively human nature and its perfection.\n\nFrancis Hutcheson follows Shaftesbury in his emphasis on the\nsubject\u2019s aesthetic response, on the distinctive sort of\npleasure that the beautiful elicits in us. Partly because the\nNeo-Platonic influence, so pronounced in Shaftesbury\u2019s\naesthetics, is washed out of Hutcheson\u2019s, to be replaced by a\nmore thorough-going empiricism, Hutcheson understands this distinctive\naesthetic pleasure as more akin to a secondary quality. Thus,\nHutcheson\u2019s aesthetic work raises the prominent question whether\n\u201cbeauty\u201d refers to something objective at all or whether\nbeauty is \u201cnothing more\u201d than a human idea or experience.\nAs in the domain of Enlightenment ethics, so with Enlightenment\naesthetics too, the step from Shaftesbury to Hutcheson marks a step\ntoward subjectivism. Hutcheson writes in one of his Two\nTreatises, his Inquiry Concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony,\nDesign (1725) that \u201cthe word \u2018beauty\u2019 is taken\nfor the idea raised in us, and a sense of beauty for\nour power of receiving this idea\u201d (Section I, Article\nIX). However, though Hutcheson understands beauty to be an idea in us,\nhe takes this idea to be \u201cexcited\u201d or\n\u201coccasioned\u201d in us by distinctive objective qualities, in\nparticular by objects that display \u201cuniformity amidst\nvariety\u201d (ibid., Section II, Article III). In the very\ntitle of Hutcheson\u2019s work above, we see the importance of the\nclassical ideas of (rational) order and harmony in Hutcheson\u2019s\naesthetic theory, even as he sets the tenor for much Enlightenment\ndiscussion of aesthetics through placing the emphasis on the\nsubjective idea and aesthetic response.\n\nDavid Hume\u2019s famous essay on \u201cthe standard of taste\u201d\nraises and addresses the epistemological problem raised by\nsubjectivism in aesthetics. If beauty is an idea in us, rather than a\nfeature of objects independent of us, then how do we understand the\npossibility of correctness and incorrectness \u2013 how do we\nunderstand the possibility of standards of judgment \u2013 in this\ndomain? The problem is posed more clearly for Hume because he\nintensifies Hutcheson\u2019s subjectivism. He writes in the\nTreatise that \u201cpleasure and pain\u2026.are not only\nnecessary attendants of beauty and deformity, but constitute their\nvery essence\u201d (Treatise, Book II, part I, section\nviii). But if a judgment of taste is based on, or expresses,\nsubjective sentiments, how can it be incorrect? In his response to\nthis question, Hume accounts for the expectation of agreement in\njudgments of taste by appealing to the fact that we share a common\nhuman nature, and he accounts for \u2018objectivity\u2019 or\nexpertise in judgments of taste, within the context of his\nsubjectivism, by appealing to the normative responses of well-placed\nobservers. Both of these points (the commonality of human nature and\nthe securing of \u2018objectivity\u2019 in judgments based on\nsentiments by appeal to the normative responses of appropriately\nplaced observers) are typical of the period more generally, and\nespecially of the strong empiricist strain in the Enlightenment. Hume\ndevelops the empiricist line in aesthetics to the point where little\nremains of the classical emphasis on the order or harmony or truth\nthat is, according to the French classicists, apprehended and\nappreciated in our aesthetic responses to the beautiful, and thus,\naccording to the classicists, the ground of aesthetic responses.\n3.3 Late Enlightenment Aesthetics\n\nImmanuel Kant faces squarely the problem of the normativity of\njudgments of taste. Influenced by Hutcheson and the British empiricist\ntradition in general, Kant understands judgments of taste to be\nfounded on a distinctive sort of feeling, a disinterested\npleasure. In taking judgments of taste to be subjective (they are\nfounded on the subject\u2019s feeling of pleasure) and non-cognitive\n(such judgments do not subsume representations under concepts and thus\ndo not ascribe properties to objects), Kant breaks with the German\nrationalist school. However Kant continues to maintain that judgments\nof beauty are like cognitive judgments in making a legitimate claim to\nuniversal agreement \u2013 in contrast to judgments of the agreeable.\nThe question is how to vindicate the legitimacy of this demand. Kant\nargues that the distinctive pleasure underlying judgments of taste is\nthe experience of the harmony of the faculties of the imagination and\nthe understanding, a harmony that arises through their \u201cfree\nplay\u201d in the process of cognizing objects on the basis of given\nsensible intuition. The harmony is \u201cfree\u201d in an experience\nof beauty in the sense that it is not forced by rules of the\nunderstanding, as is the agreement among the faculties in acts of\ncognition. The order and harmony that we experience in the face of the\nbeautiful is subjective, according to Kant; but it is at the same time\nuniversal and normative, by virtue of its relation to the conditions\nof human cognition.\n\nThe emphasis Kant places on the role of the activity of the\nimagination in aesthetic pleasure and discernment typifies a trend in\nEnlightenment thought. Whereas early in the Enlightenment, in French\nclassicism, and to some extent in Christian Wolff and other figures of\nGerman rationalism, the emphasis is on the more-or-less static\nrational order and proportion and on rigid universal rules or laws of\nreason, the trend during the development of Enlightenment aesthetics\nis toward emphasis on the play of the imagination and its\nfecundity in generating associations.\n\nDenis Diderot is an important and influential author on aesthetics. He\nwrote the entry \u201cOn the Origin and Nature of the\nBeautiful\u201d for the Encyclopedia (1752). Like Lessing in\nGermany, Diderot not only philosophized about art and beauty, but also\nwrote plays and influential art criticism. Diderot is strongly\ninfluenced in his writings on aesthetics by the empiricism in England\nand Scotland, but his writing is not limited to that standpoint.\nDiderot repeats the classical dictum that art should imitate nature,\nbut, whereas, for French classicists, the nature that art should\nimitate is ideal nature \u2013 a static, universal rational\norder \u2013 for Diderot, nature is dynamic and productive. For\nDiderot, the nature the artist ought to imitate is the real\nnature we experience, warts and all (as it were). The particularism\nand realism of Diderot\u2019s aesthetics is based on a critique of\nthe standpoint of French classicism (see Cassirer 1935, p. 295f.).\nThis critique exposes the artistic rules represented by French\nclassicists as universal rules of reason as nothing more than\nconventions marking what is considered proper within\na certain tradition. In other words, the prescriptions within the\nFrench classical tradition are artificial, not\nnatural, and constitute fetters to artistic genius. Diderot\ntakes liberation from such fetters to come from turning to the task of\nobserving and imitating actual nature. Diderot\u2019s\nemphasis on the primeval productive power and abundance of nature in\nhis aesthetic writings contributes to the trend toward focus on\nartistic creation and expression (as opposed to artistic appreciation\nand discernment) that is a characteristic of the late Enlightenment\nand the transition to Romanticism.\n\nLessing\u2019s aesthetic writings play an important role in elevating\nthe aesthetic category of expressiveness. In his famous\nLaoco\u00f6n: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry\n(1766), Lessing argues, by comparing the famous Greek statue with the\nrepresentation of Laoco\u00f6n\u2019s suffering in Virgil\u2019s\npoetry, that the aims of poetry and of the visual arts are not\nidentical; he argues that the aim of poetry is not beauty, but\nexpression. In elevating the aesthetic category of expressiveness,\nLessing challenges the notion that all art is imitation of nature. His\nargument also challenges the notion that all the various arts can be\ndeduced from a single principle. Lessing\u2019s argument in\nLaoco\u00f6n supports the contrary thesis that the distinct\narts have distinct aims and methods, and that each should be\nunderstood on its own terms, not in terms of an abstract general\nprinciple from which all arts are to be deduced. For some, especially\nfor critics of the Enlightenment, in this point Lessing is already\nbeyond the Enlightenment. Certainly it is true that the emphasis on\nthe individual or particular, over against the universal, which one\nfinds in other late Enlightenment thinkers, is in tension with\nEnlightenment tenets. Herder (following Hamann to some extent) argues\nthat each individual art object has to be understood in its\nown terms, as a totality complete unto itself. With Herder\u2019s\nstark emphasis on individuality in aesthetics, over against\nuniversality, the supplanting of the Enlightenment with Romanticism\nand Historicism is well advanced. But, according to the point of view\ntaken in this entry, the conception of the Enlightenment according to\nwhich it is distinguished by its prioritization of the order of\nabstract, universal laws and principles, over against concrete\nparticulars and the differences amongst them, is too narrow; it fails\nto account for much of the characteristic richness in the thought of\nthe period. Indeed aesthetics itself, as a discipline, which, as\nnoted, is founded in the Enlightenment by the German rationalist,\nAlexander Baumgarten, owes its existence to the tendency in the\nEnlightenment to search for and discover distinct laws for distinct\nkinds of phenomena (as opposed to insisting that all phenomena be made\nintelligible through the same set of general laws and principles).\nBaumgarten founds aesthetics as a \u2018science\u2019 through the\nattempt to establish the sensible domain as cognizable in a way\ndifferent from that which prevails in metaphysics. Aesthetics in\nGermany in the eighteenth century, from Wolff to Herder, both typifies\nmany of the trends of the Enlightenment and marks the field where the\nEnlightenment yields to competing worldviews.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Bacon, F., 1620. <em>The New Organon (Novum Organum)</em>, ed. by\nLisa Jardine and Michael Silverthorne, Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 2000.", "Batteaux, C., 1746. <em>Les beaux arts r\u00e9duit \u00e0 un\nm\u00eame principe</em> (<em>The Fine Arts Reduced to a Single\nPrinciple</em>).
