    "main_text": "Dirac and the Foundations of Quantum Theory || Wightman\u2019s Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory\n4.2 Wightman\u2019s Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory\n\nIn the early 1950s, theoretical physicists were inspired to axiomatize\nQFT. One motivation for axiomatizing a theory, not the one for the\ncase now under discussion, is to express the theory in a completely\nrigorous form in order to standardize the expression of the theory as\na mature conceptual edifice. Another motivation, more akin to the case\nin point, is to embrace a strategic withdrawal to the foundations to\ndetermine how renovation should proceed on a structure that is\nthreatening to collapse due to internal inconsistencies. One then\nlooks for existing piles (fundamental postulates) that penetrate\nthrough the quagmire to solid rock, and attempts to drive home others\nat advantageous locations. Properly supported elements of the\nsuperstructure (such as the characterization of free fields,\ndispersion relations, etc.) may then be distinguished from those that\nare untrustworthy. The latter need not be razed immediately, and may\nultimately glean supportive rigging from components not yet\nconstructed. In short, the theoretician hopes that the axiomatization\nwill effectively separate sense from nonsense, and that this will\nserve to make possible substantial progress towards the development of\na mature theory. Grounding in a rigorous mathematical framework can be\nan important part of the exercise, and that was a key aspect of the\naxiomatization of QFT by Wightman.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Schwartz\u2019s theory of distributions was used by\nWightman (1956) to develop an abstract formulation of QFT, which later\ncame to be known known as axiomatic quantum field theory.\nMature statements of this formulation are presented in Wightman and\nG\u00e5rding (1964) and in Streater and Wightman (1964). It was\nfurther refined in the late 1960s by Bogoliubov, who explicitly placed\naxiomatic QFT in the rigged Hilbert space framework (Bogoliubov et\nal. 1975, p. 256). It is by now standard within the axiomatic\napproach to put forth the following six postulates: spectral condition\n(there are no negative energies or imaginary masses), vacuum state (it\nexists and is unique), domain axiom for fields (quantum fields\ncorrespond to operator-valued distributions), transformation law\n(unitary representation in the field-operator (and state) space of the\nrestricted inhomogeneous Lorentz group \u2013\n\u201crestricted\u201d means inversions are excluded, and\n\u201cinhomogeneous\u201d means that translations are included),\nlocal commutativity (field measurements at spacelike separated regions\ndo not disturb one another), asymptotic completeness (the scattering\nmatrix is unitary \u2013 this assumption is sometimes weakened to\ncyclicity of the vacuum state with respect to the polynomial algebra\nof free fields). Rigged Hilbert space entered the axiomatic framework\nby way of the domain axiom, so this axiom will be discussed in more\ndetail below.\n\nIn classical physics, a field is is characterized as a scalar- (or\nvector- or tensor-) valued function \\(\\phi(x)\\) on a domain that\ncorresponds to some subset of spacetime points. In QFT, a field is\ncharacterized by means of an operator rather than a function. A\nfield operator may be obtained from a classical field\nfunction by quantizing the function in the canonical manner \u2013\nsee Mandl (1959, pp. 1\u201317). For convenience, the field operator\nassociated with \\(\\phi(x)\\) is denoted below by the same expression\n(since the discussion below only concerns field operators). Field\noperators that are relevant for QFT are too singular to be regarded as\nrealistic, so they are smoothed out over their respective domains\nusing elements of a space of well-behaved functions known as test\nfunctions. There are many different test-functions spaces\n(Gelfand and Shilov 1977, Chapter 4). At first, the test-function\nspace of choice for axiomatic QFT was the Schwartz space\n\\(\\Sigma\\), the space of functions whose elements have partial\nderivatives of all orders at each point and such that each function\nand its derivatives decreases faster than \\(x^{-n}\\) for any \\(n\\in\nN\\) as \\(x\\rightarrow \\infty\\). It was later determined that some\nrealistic models require the use of other test-function spaces. The\nsmoothed field operators \\(\\phi[f\\)] for \\(f \\in \\Sigma\\) are known as\nquantum field operators, and they are defined as follows\n\n\\[ \\phi[f] = \\int d^4 x f(x)\\phi(x). \\]\n\n\nThe integral (over the domain of the field operator) of the product of\nthe test function \\(f(x)\\) and the field operator \\(\\phi(x)\\) serves\nto \u201csmooth out\u201d the field operator over its domain; a more\ncolloquial description is that the field is \u201csmeared out\u201d\nover space or spacetime. It is postulated within the axiomatic\napproach that a quantum field operator \\(\\phi[f\\)] may be represented\nas an unbounded operator on a separable Hilbert space \\(\\Eta\\), and\nthat \\(\\{\\phi[f]: f\\in \\Sigma \\}\\) (the set of smoothed field\noperators associated with \\(\\phi(x))\\) has a dense domain \\(\\Omega\\)\nin \\(\\Eta\\). The smoothed field operators are often referred to as\noperator-valued distributions, and this means that for every\n\\(\\Phi,\\Psi \\in \\Omega\\) there is an element of the space of\ndistributions \\(\\Sigma^x\\), the topological dual of \\(\\Sigma\\), that\nmay be equated to the expression \\(\\langle \\Phi {\\mid} \\phi[\\\n]{\\mid}\\Psi\\rangle\\). If \\(\\Omega'\\) denotes the set of functions\nobtained by applying all polynomials of elements of \\(\\{\\phi[f]: f\\in\n\\Sigma \\}\\) onto the unique vacuum state, then the axioms mentioned\nabove entail that \\(\\Omega'\\) is dense in \\(\\Eta\\) (asymptotic\ncompleteness) and that \\(\\Omega'\\subset \\Omega\\) (domain axiom). The\nelements of \\(\\Omega\\) correspond to possible states of the elements\nof \\(\\{\\phi[f]: f\\in \\Sigma \\}\\). Though only one field has been\nconsidered thus far, the formalism is easily generalizable to a\ncountable number of fields with an associated set of countably indexed\nfield operators \\(\\phi_k (x)\\) \u2013 cf. (Streater and Wightman\n1964).\n\nAs noted earlier, the appropriateness of the rigged Hilbert space\nframework enters by way of the domain axiom. Concerning that axiom,\nWightman says the following (in the notation introduced above, which\ndiffers slightly from that used by Wightman).\n\nAt a more advanced stage in the theory it is likely that one would\nwant to introduce a topology into \\(\\Omega\\) such that \\(\\phi[f\\)]\nbecomes a continuous mapping of \\(\\Omega\\) into \\(\\Omega\\). It is\nlikely that this topology has to be rather strong. We want to\nemphasize that so far we have only required that \\(\\langle\n\\Phi{\\mid}\\phi[f]{\\mid}\\Psi\\rangle\\) be continuous in \\(f\\)\nfor \\(\\Phi ,\\Psi\\) fixed; continuity in the\npair \\(\\Phi ,\\Psi\\) cannot be expected before we put a suitable strong\ntopology on \\(\\Omega\\) (Wightman and G\u00e5rding 1964, p. 137).\n\n\nIn Bogoliubov et al. (1975, p. 256), a topology is introduced\nto serve this role, though it is introduced on \\(\\Omega'\\) rather than\non \\(\\Omega\\). Shortly thereafter, they assert that it is not hard to\nshow that \\(\\Omega'\\) is a complete nuclear space with respect to this\ntopology. This serves to justify a claim they make earlier in their\ntreatise:\n\n\u2026 it is precisely the consideration of the triplet of spaces\n\\(\\Omega \\subset \\Eta \\subset \\Omega^*\\) which give a natural basis\nfor both the construction of a general theory of linear operators and\nthe correct statement of certain problems of quantum field theory\n(Bogoliubov et al. 1975, p. 34).\n\n\nNote that they refer to the triplet \\(\\Omega \\subset \\Eta \\subset\n\\Omega^*\\) as a rigged Hilbert space. In the terminology introduced\nabove, they refer in effect to the Gelfand triplet \\((\\Omega , \\Eta ,\n\\Omega^x )\\) or (equivalently) the associated rigged Hilbert space\n\\((\\Omega , \\Omega^x)\\) .\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the status of the field in\nalgebraic QFT differs from that in Wightman\u2019s axiomatic QFT. In\nboth approaches, a field is an abstract system having an infinite\nnumber of degrees of freedom. Sub-atomic quantum particles are field\neffects that appear in special circumstances. In algebraic QFT, there\nis a further abstraction: the most fundamental entities are the\nelements of the algebra of local (and quasi-local) observables, and\nthe field is a derived notion. The term local means bounded\nwithin a finite spacetime region, and an observable is not regarded as\na property belonging to an entity other than the spacetime region\nitself. The term quasi-local is used to indicate that we take\nthe union of all bounded spacetime regions. In short, the algebraic\napproach focuses on local (or quasi-local) observables and treats the\nnotion of a field as a derivative notion; whereas the axiomatic\napproach (as characterized just above) regards the field concept as\nthe fundamental notion. Indeed, it is common practice for proponents\nof the algebraic approach to distance themselves from the field notion\nby referring to their theory as \u201clocal quantum physics\u201d.\nThe two approaches are mutually complementary \u2013 they have\ndeveloped in parallel and have influenced each other by analogy\n(Wightman 1976). For a discussion of the close connections between\nthese two approaches, see Haag (1996, p. 106).\n5 Philosophical Issues\n",
