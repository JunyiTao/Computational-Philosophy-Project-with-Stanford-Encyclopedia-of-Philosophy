    "main_text": "How can information technology itself solve privacy concerns? || Cryptography\n3.3 Cryptography\n\nCryptography has long been used as a means to protect data, dating\nback to the Caesar cipher more than two thousand years ago. Modern\ncryptographic techniques are essential in any IT system that needs to\nstore (and thus protect) personal data, for example by providing\nsecure (confidential) connections for browsing (HTTPS) and networking\n(VPN). Note however that by itself cryptography does not provide any\nprotection against data breaching; only when applied correctly in a\nspecific context does it become a \u2018fence\u2019 around personal\ndata. In addition, cryptographic schemes that become outdated by\nfaster computers or new attacks may pose threats to (long-term)\nprivacy.\nCryptography is a large\nfield, so any description here will be incomplete. The focus will be\ninstead on some newer cryptographic techniques, in particular\nhomomorphic encryption, that have the potential to become very\nimportant for processing and searching in personal data.\n\nVarious techniques exist for searching through encrypted data (Song et\nal. 2000, Wang et al. 2016), which provides a form of privacy\nprotection (the data is encrypted) and selective access to sensitive\ndata. One relatively new technique that can be used for designing\nprivacy-preserving systems is \u2018homomorphic encryption\u2019\n(Gentry 2009, Acar et al. 2018). Homomorphic encryption allows a data\nprocessor to process encrypted data, i.e. users could send personal\ndata in encrypted form and get back some useful results \u2013 for\nexample, recommendations of movies that online friends like \u2013 in\nencrypted form. The original user can then again decrypt the result\nand use it without revealing any personal data to the data processor.\nHomomorphic encryption, for example, could be used to aggregate\nencrypted data thereby allowing both privacy protection and useful\n(anonymized) aggregate information. The technique is currently not\nwidely applied; there are serious performance issues if one wants to\napply full homomorphic encryption to the large amounts of data stored\nin today\u2019s systems. However, variants of the original homomorphic\nencryption scheme are emerging, such as Somewhat Homomorphic\nEncryption (Badawi et al. 2018), that are showing promise to be more\nwidely applied in practice.\n\nThe main idea behind blockchain technology was first described in the\nseminal paper on Bitcoins (Nakamoto, n.d., Other Internet Resources).\nA blockchain is basically a distributed ledger that stores\ntransactions in a non-reputable way, without the use of a trusted\nthird party. Cryptography is used to ensure that all transactions are\n\u201capproved\u201d by members of the blockchain and stored in such a way\nthat they are linked to previous transactions and cannot be removed.\nAlthough focused on data integrity and not inherently anonymous,\nblockchain technology enables many privacy-related applications\n(Yli-Huumo et al. 2016, Karame and Capkun 2018), such as anonymous\ncryptocurrency (Narayanan et al. 2016) and self-sovereign identity\n(see below).\n",
