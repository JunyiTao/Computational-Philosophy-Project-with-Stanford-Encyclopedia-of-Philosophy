The study of inheritance systems is aimed at\nidentifying and classifying the various mechanisms and processes of\nheredity, the types of hereditary information that is passed on by\neach, the functional interaction between the different systems, and\nthe evolutionary consequences of these properties.\n\nIt is now common to identify heredity with the transmission of genes,\nor even more concretely with the transmission of DNA sequence, from\nparents to offspring. It is, however, clear on reflection that there\nare other ways in which offspring may receive from parents resources\nor cues that affect their development. This is particularly apparent\nin humans, and the suggestion that social and cultural cues may serve\nas an additional \u201cinheritance system\u201d has been made many\ntimes. These observations, and the models of dual inheritance of genes\nand culture (e.g., Boyd & Richerson 1985; Cavalli-Sforza &\nFeldman 1981; Durham 1991; for a recent overview see Mesoudi 2011,\nLewens 2015), are a useful starting point from which to approach the\nmore general project of elucidating the notion of inheritance system.\nCultural inheritance, however, is a broad category, whereas the\nanalysis of inheritance systems discussed below tends to be more\nfine-grained (see Sterelny 2001: 337). The term \u201cinheritance\nsystems\u201d is used to describe different mechanisms, processes,\nand factors, by which different kinds of hereditary information and\nvariation are stored and transmitted between generations.\n\nWe present the discussion of inheritance systems in the context of\nseveral debates. First, between proponents of monism about heredity\n(gene-centric views), holism about heredity (Developmental Systems\nTheory), and those stressing the role of multiple systems of\ninheritance. Second, between those analyzing inheritance solely in\nterms of replication and transmission, and views that stress the\nmulti-generation reproduction of phenotypic traits. A third debate is\nconcerned with different criteria that have been proposed for\nidentifying and delimiting inheritance systems. A fourth controversy\nrevolves around the evolutionary implications of the existence of the\ndifferent inheritance systems, for example the significance of the\n\u201cLamarckian\u201d aspects of some of the inheritance systems\nthat have been identified, such as epigenetic inheritance and\nbehavioral inheritance, as well as potentially the inheritance of\nmicrobial symbionts (i.e., the microbiome) that allow the transmission\nof environmentally induced characters (i.e., \u201csoft\ninheritance\u201d).\n\nThis entry is organized as follows: Sections 1 and 2 provide common\nground and historical context for the discussion.

Introduction\n1.1 Heredity and Inheritance\n\nIt is useful to distinguish between the following terms. The terms\nheredity and hereditary will be used henceforth to\nrefer to reliable resemblance relations between parents and offspring.\nParticular traits (phenotypic or genotypic) may be hereditary in this\n sense.[1]\n The term inheritance will be used to refer to causal\nprocesses of transmission between parents and offspring that account\nfor heredity, and the mechanisms responsible for them. We might, for\nexample, say that eye color is hereditary, and that genetic\ninheritance accounts for the heredity of eye color (or, more formally,\nfor the heredity of variations in eye color). Multiple inheritance\nprocesses may be implicated in the heredity of a particular phenotypic\ntrait. Inheritance is often construed as transmission of information,\nthough this notion raises difficulties; this issue is discussed in\n section 2.4.\n\nThe terms parent and offspring are used in a general\nsense, since transmission may be from individuals other than the\ngenetic parents of the organism (i.e., non-vertical). Multiple\ninheritance systems may lead to multiple\n\u201cparent-offspring\u201d relations.\n1.2 Early Work On Non-Genetic Inheritance\n\nModern evolutionary theory equates inheritance with the transmission\nof genes from parents to offspring and as such focuses only on genetic\ninheritance (which will be further described in section 3.3.1).\nNevertheless, biologists have long known of patterns of inheritance,\nand eventually of inheritance mechanisms, that go beyond genetic\ninheritance (Jablonka & Lamb 2005; Sapp 1987). Two fundamental\ntypes of arguments led to this conclusion: arguments based on\nobservations regarding patterns of inheritance, and arguments\nconcerned with the localization of hereditary factors inside cells.\nArguments of the first kind were based on hereditary relations and\ninheritance patterns that fail to conform to the rules of Mendelian\ninheritance (e.g., maternal inheritance). If Mendelian inheritance\npatterns are the result of the way the chromosomes in the eukaryotic\ncell nucleus behave, non-Mendelian heredity must depend on separate\ninheritance processes, mechanisms, or systems (Beale 1966; Sager\n1966). Second, there were observations of hereditary phenomena that\nseemed to depend on factors residing in the cytoplasm of cells, rather\nthan their nucleus, where the genetic material is localized. The\ninterpretation of these observations was highly contested (Darlington\n1944; Sapp 1987).\n\nToday, we know that some of these observations are related to the\n(maternal) inheritance of organelles residing in the cytoplasm, such\nas the mitochondria and chloroplasts, organelles which carry their own\nDNA. This however does not encompass all the mechanisms which underlie\ncytoplasmatic inheritance. Paradigmatic work on cytoplasmatic\ninheritance done by Sonneborn, Beale, Nanney, and their colleagues in\nthe 1950s and 1960s, was concerned with patterns of inheritance in\nunicellular organisms, and in particular the protist genus\nParamecium. It was suggested that the self-sustaining\nregulatory loops that maintain gene activity or inactivity in a cell\nwould persist through cell division, provided the non-DNA components\nof the system (many of which reside in the cytoplasm in eukaryotic\nmicroogranisms) were shared among daughter cells. In this way,\nalternative regulatory phenotypic states would be inherited. Among the\nproperties whose inheritance was studied were mating-type variations,\nserotype variations, and the structural or \u201csurface\ninheritance\u201d of ciliary structures. Remarkably, microsurgical\nchanges to the ciliary structures on the surface of\nParamecium cells are inherited by offspring. The stability of\ninduced characters once the stimulus was removed (called\n\u201ccellular memory\u201d) and the number of generations\ncharacters were maintained varied widely. However, the results\nindicated that long-term stability and heritability need not be the\nresult of changes to the DNA sequence (Nanney 1958).\n\nDuring the 1950s to 1970s a growing set of observations indicated that\ndetermined and differentiated states of cells are transmitted in cell\nlineages. These observations concerned studies of Drosophila imaginal\ndiscs by Ernst Hadorn; Briggs and King\u2019s cloning experiments\nwith amphibians; Mary Lyon\u2019s work on X-chromosome inactivation;\nand work establishing the in vitro clonal stability of\ncultured cell lines. Eventually, the term epigenetic\ninheritance came to refer to hereditary variation that does not\ninvolve changes to the DNA sequence.\n\nThe brief account of some of the early work on unicellular organisms\ngiven above illustrates some of the distinctions that are elaborated\nin the rest of this entry. One group of questions is concerned with\nthe properties of hereditary relations, the sources of variations (in\nparticular, whether they can be environmentally induced), the\nstability of variations and their regulation, and so on. A second\nclass of questions is concerned with the way hereditary information is\nstored and transmitted. It is here that we can locate the debates\nabout nuclear versus cytoplasmatic inheritance and about the primacy\nof DNA as the information store of the cell. Although the distinction\nbetween these two groups of questions is useful, many of the topics\nand controversies to be discussed in this entry involve both.\n1.3 Monism, Holism, and Multiple Systems views\n\nThe increasing focus by biologists on DNA as a \u201cmaster\nmolecule\u201d containing coded genetic information, after the\ndiscovery of the double helix structure in 1953, on the one hand, and\nthe gene-selectionist view articulated in 1966 by George Williams in\nhis book Adaptation and Natural Selection, which culminated\nin the \u201creplicator\u201d concept in philosophy of biology\n(Dawkins 1976; Hull 1980, see entry:\n Replication and Reproduction),\n on the other, led to a tendency to view biological inheritance as\nconsisting of a single channel of transmission. This channel is\nunderstood to involve the inheritance of genetic information encoded\nin DNA (or, in some viruses in RNA), a view often referred to as\n\u201cgeno-centrism\u201d. It should be noted that the replicator\nconcept itself does not rule out non-genetic replicators (Dawkins\n1976, see also the discussion by Sterelny, Smith, & Dickison\n1996). The dual-inheritance model of biological and cultural evolution\nwhich is based on two types of replicators, genes and memes, is a\nparadigmatic example that is based on the replicator framework, and\nthat involves both more than one channel of inheritance and\nnon-genetic inheritance (for detailed discussion of the notion of\ncultural inheritance see the entry on\n cultural evolution).\n Accounts of heredity that are based on the notion of replicators may\napproach non-genetic inheritance by characterizing multiple\nkinds of replicators (e.g., memes), each of which is supposed\nto underlie a different channel of non-genetic inheritance. John\nMaynard Smith and E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry\u2019s account of\nMajor Transitions in Evolution is organized around\ntransitions to new kinds of ways in which information is stored and\ntransmitted, understood as transitions to new kinds of replicating\nentities (Maynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995), and multiple\ntypes of replicators are embraced by the notion of the extended\nreplicator (Sterelny 2001; Sterelny et al. 1996, see entry:\n Replication and Reproduction)\n discussed below. More typically, however, non-genetic forms of\ninheritance, with the possible exception of cultural inheritance in a\nfew groups of higher animals, are often ruled out as not fulfilling\nthe requirements imposed by the definition of a replicator (regarding\nthe debate whether human cultural evolution is best understood through\napplying a replicator framework to learning and imitation, see Lewens\n2015, chps. 1 and 2). It should be emphasized that the replicator view\nposited replicators, typically genes, as the unit of selection; the\nwork discussed in this entry is concerned with the biological\nprocesses and mechanisms involved in inheritance, and is not concerned\ndirectly with the debate about the unit of selection. Implications\nregarding selection are elaborated in\n section 4.1.\n\nApproaches that rule out or ignore non-genetic inheritance might be\ncharacterized as \u201cmonist\u201d in their treatment of the\nquestion of the existence and significance of multiple inheritance\nsystems. Monist tendencies may be traced back already to Wilhelm\nJohannsen\u2019s work at the beginning of the 20th century. While\nJohannsen invented the term \u201cgene\u201d in order to remain\nuncommitted to a specific view about the material constitution of\nhereditary factors, both this term and the notion of\n\u201cgenotype\u201d that he developed suggest a monist view of\ninheritance. This tendency was reinforced by molecular genetics and\nthe replicator framework.\n\nHow do monist views handle the other forms of inheritance that are\nknown to exist? Consider the mitochondria. Monist accounts regard the\nmaternal inheritance of organelles such as the mitochondria, which\nmight conceivably be thought to constitute a separate inheritance\nchannel, if not system, to be of marginal conceptual importance.\nFirst, it can be argued that being based on genetically coded\ninformation (DNA sequence), the similarities with nuclear inheritance\nallows it to be seen as not involving a distinct inheritance system,\nif this notion is understood to refer to the way hereditary\ninformation is stored and transmitted. Indeed, views that focus on\nmultiple inheritance systems may, for the very same reason, not\nconsider the inheritance of plastids as based on a distinct\ninheritance system. Second, it is assumed that the evolution of\ncomplex organismal traits is to be explained by natural selection\nacting on variation in genetic information in the nucleus. Thus,\nmitchondrial inheritance, and plastid inheritance more generally, are\nconsidered to be of limited explanatory value when trying to give a\ngeneral account of the evolution of the organism (beyond the early\nstages of endosymbiogenesis), and is of interest mainly when\nconsidering the evolution of the mitochonrdia themselves, in which\ncase there is yet again a single inheritance system that is relevant,\nthat of the mitochondrial genome. Similar reasoning is applied more\ngenerally to reject forms of supposedly extra-genetic inheritance that\nare not based on the transmission of DNA, by claiming either that the\ninheritance fails to be the transmission of information or that the\ninformation that can be transmitted is limited and thus not\nevolutionarily significant, and is merely the transmission of material\nresources or infrastructure. Cashed out in the terms of the replicator\nframework, arguments against supposed cases of extra-genetic\ninheritance are that they do not lead to the establishment of\nreplicators, which are entities that are faithfully copied and passed\ndown multiple generations, yet replicators are necessary for evolution\nby natural selection, or that extra-genetic inheritance leads to\nreplicators that are limited in the repertoire of variants they\nsupport (see Godfrey-Smith 2000). Proponents of the multiple\ninheritance systems view and of holistic views about inheritance argue\nthat these requirements are either unnecessary or too strong, and lead\nto a distorted understanding of evolution (see Griffiths & Gray\n2001; Jablonka 2001).\n\nIn contrast to monist views, proponents of \u201cDevelopmental\nSystems Theory\u201d (DST) (Griffiths & Gray 1994, 2001) offer a\nradical reformulation of evolutionary theory, including the notion of\ninheritance and the treatment of extra-genetic inheritance. DST\napplies the notion of inheritance to any developmental resource that\nis reliably present in successive generations, and which is part of\nthe explanation of the similarity between generations (Griffiths &\nGray 2001). While embracing the existence of non-genetic inheritance,\nand its significance for evolutionary accounts, these researchers\nargue against separating these phenomena into multiple channels or\nsystems of inheritance (Griffiths & Gray 2001): Inheritance\nphenomena are so intertwined in their effects on development, and each\nrelies on others to have its developmental effect, that it is both\nmore realistic and scientifically more productive not to separate them\ninto distinct channels, systems, or replicator types. The DST approach\nmight be characterized as \u201cholistic\u201d in its treatment of\ninheritance.\n\nIn contrast to monism and holism, the views discussed in this entry\nidentify and classify various mechanisms and processes of inheritance,\nthe types of hereditary information that are passed on by each, the\nfunction and interaction of the different systems, and the\nevolutionary consequences of these properties. Contemporary views on\nevolution that stress the role of multiple systems of inheritance have\nbeen greatly influenced by the work Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb, in\nparticular their arguments about the evolutionary role of epigenetic\ninheritance (Jablonka 2001, 2002; Jablonka & Lamb 1995, 2005/2014,\n2006) . In addition to the line of work influenced by Jablonka and\nLamb, extra-genetic inheritance is stressed by DST, albeit in the form\nof holism about inheritance, and in the \u201cextended\nreplicator\u201d framework elaborated by Kim Sterelny et al.\n(Sterelny 2001; Sterelny et al. 1996).\n\nResponding to pressure from DST, the extended replicator approach\nelaborates the account of non-genetic replicators provided by the\nreplicator framework (Dawkins 1976; Hull 1980) to include non-genetic\nreplicators, while retaining the replicator/interactor distinction\nwhich both the holism of DST and the multiple systems view of Jablonka\nand Lamb reject: Replicators form lineages, while interactors, through\nwhich replicators interact with the environment, are ephemeral (see\n section 2.2\n for discussion). Sterelny et al. (1996) emphasize the distinction\nbetween genes as factors having \u201ca distinctive informational\nrole in inheritance\u201d and other reliably present developmental\nresources. According to them, this distinctive informational role\nexplains why genes, and not just any resource, represent the\nphenotype and have a special developmental role. They embrace other\ncases of biological replication if they can be informational in the\nstrong sense their account demands. In a nutshell, the main\nrequirements are that the replicator have the biofunction (i.e.,\nproper function or evolutionarily selected function) of representing\nthe phenotype (or aspects of it) and that it play a causal role in the\nproduction of the phenotype. Genes according to this view do not have\na unique or privileged role in determining the phenotype; however,\nthey do have a distinctive informational role (see\n section 2.4).\n Whether other types of replicators exist is an empirical matter, and\nviewing various biological processes as replication may be\nscientifically productive according to Sterelny et al. (1996). In more\nrecent work, Griffiths appeals to causal specificity for roughly the\nsame purpose. He frames the debate as being about the extent to which\nnon-genetic inheritance is involved in the precise determination of\nthe phenotype, or how specific the causal relation is (see\n section 2.4).\n1.4 Variation, Hereditary Variation, and Inheritance Systems\n\nA fundamental requirement for evolutionary change via natural\nselection is the existence of variation in the population.\nHowever, for variations to have evolutionary effect they need to be\n(at least partly) hereditary or heritable (see entry on\n heritability;\n I will here focus on hereditary variations and hereditary\ntransmissibility as defined above, and will not discuss the notion of\nheritability which is a population term). It is hereditary\nvariations that fuel evolution through natural selection\n(Lewontin 1970, 1985). Thus, if we aim to give a general account of\npossible evolutionary change we may start by examining and classifying\nhereditary variations (Jablonka & Lamb 2005). Hereditary\nvariation, in turn, may be accounted for in terms of inheritance\nmechanisms, hence by accounts of inheritance systems. As a\nstarting point we can understand the notion of inheritance system as\nreferring to mechanisms, processes, and participating factors, that\nare involved in transmission between parents and offspring leading to\nhereditary relations. Several influential accounts of inheritance\nsystems that are of philosophical interest are discussed in\n section 3.\n2. Reproduction and Replication\n\nWork on inheritance systems is often situated in the context of\ndevelopmental evolutionary biology, and attaches great significance to\nthe ways in which inheritance interacts with the development of\nphenotypes. This section contrasts this perspective on inheritance\nwith views that focus on replication. James Griesemer\u2019s\nreproducer notion which combines inheritance and development is\npresented. Finally, the relationship between inheritance systems and\nnotions of biological information is discussed.\n2.1 Multi-generation reproduction of phenotypes\n\nIn contrast to the replicator view that looks for reliably replicating\nentities that either produce copies of themselves, induce the\nproduction of such copies, or pass on their structure through\nreplication processes (Dawkins 1976; Hull 1980), the views discussed\nin what follows see natural selection as depending on the reliable\nmulti-generation reproduction or reconstruction of phenotypes, and\nconceptualize inheritance accordingly (for related discussion of the\ntopics in this section and historical details see the entry on\n replication).\n This perspective opens up many questions that the discussion of\ninheritance systems attempts to address. First among these is how\nhereditary resources or inheritance processes affect the development\nof offspring so as to reliably reconstruct parental phenotypic\ncharacters; this question is shared more generally by developmental\nevolutionary biology (Evo-Devo) and Developmental Systems Theory.\nReconstruction typically occurs during the development of the\noffspring, which is more or less independent from the parent, and may\nbe a complex, multi-stage, and temporally drawn out process. It may\ninvolve more than one inheritance system and depend on interactions\nbetween inheritance systems, depend on persistent environmental\nresources such as sunlight and gravity as well as environmental\nconditions produced by organisms and interactions with them (niche\nconstruction), and depend on processes such as pattern formation that\ngive rise to what might be characterized as emergent properties. We\nnow turn to a discussion of inheritance thus construed vis-a-vis the\nnotion of replication.\n2.2 Inheritance and replication\n\nAs mentioned earlier, two major influences led to the emphasis on\nreplication as a necessary condition for evolution via natural\nselection: the influence of the replicator framework and the discovery\nof the molecular basis of genetic inheritance, in particular DNA\nreplication. In their 1953 paper on the structure of DNA, James Watson\nand Francis Crick famously noted that the properties of the double\nhelix structure suggest a straightforward method for replicating the\nDNA sequence. It is now known that DNA replication is\nsemiconservative: each of the strands of the double stranded DNA\nmolecule is used as a template for constructing a complementary\nstrand, and the replication process results in two DNA molecules, each\ncontaining one of the original strands and one newly constructed\nstrand. In the absence of mutations, each of the new double stranded\nDNA molecules has the same sequence of base pairs (nucleotides) the\noriginal DNA molecule had. DNA replication explains how the\ninformation in the DNA sequence is copied, so that when the cell\ndivides each daughter cell ends up with a complete copy of the\noriginal cell\u2019s DNA. This is a critical element of genetic\ninheritance, though the genetic inheritance processes of mitosis and\nmeiosis are far more involved than DNA replication, which is only one\ncomponent of them.\n\nWhen considered from the perspective of accounting for the reliable\nreconstruction of parental phenotypes, replication of the kind found\nin genetic inheritance is seen to be neither sufficient nor necessary\nfor heredity (Jablonka 2004, has a particularly clear discussion of\nthese issues). The inheritance of cellular properties as a consequence\nof self-sustaining metabolic loops, one kind of cellular epigenetic\ninheritance, is an example of inheritance not involving replicators.\nPartly on the basis of cellular epigenetic inheritance and similar\nobservations about other forms of extra-genetic inheritance, such as\nbehavioral and linguistic transmission, that do not conform with the\nreplicator framework, Jablonka has argued that the\nreplicator/interactor distinction should be rejected (Jablonka 2001,\n2004). More generally, she argued that \u201cthe replicator/vehicle\ndichotomy\u2026 is meaningless in all cases in which the\ntransmission of information or the generation of new heritable\ninformation depends on development\u201d (Jablonka 2001: 114).\nGodfrey-Smith (2009: sec. 2.4) discusses formal arguments showing that\nreplicators are not a necessary condition for evolution by natural\nselection.\n\nDNA replication is also not sufficient for explaining cellular\nheredity, since cellular heredity depends on support from epigenetic\nnuclear and cytoplasmatic inheritance mechanisms that maintain proper\ngene regulation. This point has been made during the historical\ndebates about cytoplasmatic inheritance (Nanney 1958; Sapp 1987).\nMoreover, cellular epigenetic inheritance is essential for cell\ndifferentiation in multi-cellular organisms, which involves the\nestablishment of lineages of cells that produce tissue specific\nphenotypes that are not due to differences in DNA sequence.\nDifferentiated cells inherit their tissue-specificity, which they\nusually do not alter throughout their life-cycle. This means that in\naddition to its role in cellular heredity, cellular epigenetic\ninheritance is essential for the multi-generation reconstruction of\nphenotypes of multi-cellular organisms, regardless of any direct role\ntransgenerational epigenetic inheritance plays in the transmission of\ncharacters from parent to offspring above the cellular level, though\nsuch effects are also well known (see Jablonka & Raz 2009).\n2.3 The reproducer concept\n\nJames Griesemer has proposed the reproducer as a fundamental\nnotion for thinking about reproduction in evolution. A reproducer is\nan entity that multiplies with material overlap between parent and\noffspring, transferring mechanisms conferring the capacity to develop\nthe capacity to reproduce (Griesemer 2000a: S361, 2000b, 2000c, see\nalso the entry on\n replication,\n section 8). By definition, being a reproducer is a property\napplicable to systems that have developmental capacities. In contrast\nwith traditional accounts of natural selection that focus on heredity,\nGriesemer\u2019s analysis of reproduction processes attempts to\nintegrate heredity and development in a single conceptual scheme.\nGodfrey-Smith has argued that both requirements emphasized by\nGriesemer \u2014 material overlap between generations, and the\ncapacity to develop \u2014 are too strong, and are not required for a\nformal account of evolution via natural selection per se\n(Godfrey-Smith 2009: 83\u201384).\n\nBased on the reproducer concept, Griesemer has proposed an analysis of\nmodes of multiplication in which reproduction, inheritance, and\nreplication are special cases of multiplication processes (Griesemer\n2000a: S360; 2000c). According to this classification, inheritance\nprocesses are reproduction processes in which there are evolved\nmechanisms for producing hereditary relations in development.\nReplication processes in turn are inheritance processes with\nevolved coding mechanisms. Thus, replication (which is contrasted by\nGriesemer with mere copying) is a special case of inheritance, itself\na special case of biological reproduction. Genetic inheritance is a\nreplication process and as such it involves coding mechanisms. Since\ngenes do not constitute mechanisms of development in their own right,\nbut are pieces of mechanisms, Griesemer argues that they cannot have\nthe privileged explanatory role often accorded to them (Griesemer\n2000a: 364). According to Griesemer\u2019s classification, epigenetic\ninheritance processes can be classified as inheritance processes which\nare not replication processes (Griesemer 2000c: 250).\n\nBoth Griesemer and Godfrey-Smith applied their respective notions of\nreproducers to the question of collective reproduction, involving\nentities that can reproduce but that contain other things than can\nalso reproduce (see Godfrey-Smith 2012, Griesemer 2018; for further\ndiscussion see entry on\n the biological notion of individual).\n The paradigmatic test cases are multi-cellular organisms (arguably,\ncollective reproducers) and animal groups (who are arguably not).\nGriesemer focuses on the role of scaffolding and levels of\ncompositional organization, while Godfrey-Smith characterizes\ncollective reproduction according to the degree of overall integration\nof the reproducer, the degree of reproductive (germ/soma)\nspecialization, and the degree of a reproductive bottleneck. The\nproperties characterizing collective reproducers are arguably related\nto the inheritance systems involved (for one intriguing suggestion\nconcerned with the role of epigenetic inheritance in the origin of the\ngerm-line see Lachmann & Libby 2016). \n\nGriesemer\u2019s classification of reproducers is an abstraction\nhierarchy. It provides a formal taxonomy of reproducers, arranging\nthem in a series of nested classes. The classification of inheritance\nsystems suggested by Jablonka and Lamb (Jablonka 2001; Jablonka &\nLamb 2005/2014) discussed in the next section, in contrast, enumerates\ntypes of concrete inheritance systems found in the living world.\n2.4 Inheritance systems and notions of information\n\nIt is tempting to try to apply the notion of information to the study\nof inheritance systems in general, and extra-genetic inheritance in\nparticular, since on an abstract level inheritance may be thought of\nas transmission of information or informational resources from parent\nto offspring (as opposed to the transmission of material resources).\nHowever, it is notoriously difficult to come up with notions of\ninformation that are suitable for studying the various aspects of\nbiological phenomena (see the entry on\n biological information\n for a survey) and a fair amount of skepticism may be in order.\n\nA common argument in favor of treating genetic inheritance as having a\nunique developmental role is the claim that genes play an\ninformational role, not shared by other hereditary developmental\nresources. The holistic view of inheritance articulated by\nDevelopmental Systems Theory downplays the significance of the idea\nthat inheritance should be conceived as the transmission of\ninformation between generations (Griffiths & Gray 2001; Sterelny\n2001: 334, see also the discussion in Sterelny et al. 1996: 379). In\nparticular, DST uses the so-called parity argument to reject\nthe view that DNA is uniquely informational while other inherited\nresources merely provide material support for reading or interpreting\nDNA (Griffiths & Knight 1998). In recent work Griffiths applies an\ninformation-theoretic measure of causal specificity to measure how a\ngiven factor contributes to the precise determination of the\nphenotype. This measure is produced by combining the classic notion of\nmutual information, as found in Shannon information theory, with\nWoodward\u2019s notion of speficity of causes (Woodward 2010).\nGriffiths (2017) argues that this framework naturally extends to\nvarious epigenetic marks and non-coding regions of DNA that are\ncausally specific, while at the same time distinguishing these cases\nfrom many other causes of the same outcomes, such as the presence of\nRNA polymerase, that lack such specificity.\n\nJablonka (Jablonka 2001, 2002) introduced her discussion of\ninheritance systems by characterizing them as systems that carry\nhereditary information, which in turn she defined as \u201cthe\ntransmissible organization of an actual or potential state of a\nsystem\u201d (cf. the different notion of information and\nrepresentation favored by Sterelny et. al. 1996). A common framework\nfor discussing hereditary information can then be used to compare and\nanalyze various inheritance systems and expose their differences as\nwell similarities (see\n section 3.3).\n3. Classification of Inheritance Systems\n\nIt is now fairly common in biological discourse to talk about various\nforms of inheritance in addition to genetic inheritance. The two types\nof inheritance most often referred to are probably cellular epigenetic\ninheritance and cultural and behavioral inheritance in humans and\nvarious animals. There is however no standardized or de facto system\nor nomenclature used to classify inheritance systems and their\nproperties. This is partly due to the wide range of hereditary\nphenomena and the debates described earlier. A principled taxonomy\nwould provide a guide for identifying inheritance systems, delimiting\nthem from one another, comparing their properties and possible\nfunctions, and so on.\n\nThis section begins by making clear the distinction between\ninheritance systems and channels of inheritance. Various criteria that\nhave been proposed for identifying inheritance systems are then\npresented. The section concludes with a detailed discussion of the\ninfluential account of inheritance systems presented by Jablonka and\nLamb and a discussion of ecological inheritance and niche\nconstruction.\n3.1 Inheritance Channels\n\nAn important distinction between inheritance channels and\ninheritance systems should be made before classifying\ninheritance systems. This distinction plays a central role in\ncontroversies over classifying and delimiting inheritance systems.\nSimply put, inheritance channels refer to \u201croutes across\ngenerations\u201d (in the words of Sterelny et al. (Sterelny et al.\n1996: 390)) through which hereditary resources or information pass\nfrom parent to offspring. The notion of inheritance system, in\ncontrast, as used by Jablonka and Lamb in particular, is meant to\nclassify inheritance factors, mechanisms, and processes, and the ways\nin which they store and carry hereditary information (Jablonka 2001;\nJablonka & Lamb 2005).\n\nMultiple inheritance channels may be involved in the reconstruction of\nthe phenotype. For example, as noted in the discussion of cellular\nheredity, inheritance of organelles during cell division is required\nfor the survival of daughter cells in addition to the inheritance of\nthe nuclear genome. The role of multiple channels is particularly\napparent in cases where phenotypes depend on symbiotic associations\nand thus on the transmission of symbionts. Examples of transmission of\nsymbionts include: (1) The transmission of gut bacteria, which are\nrequired for digestion and for normal intestinal development, from\nmother to offspring. (2) Fungus-growing ants depend on the cultivation\nof fungus for food in underground gardens. When new queens leave their\nparent colonies, they carry a fragment of the fungus with them to the\nsite of the new colony. (3) Various species of aphids, clams, and\nsponges allow some bacteria to pass through the oocytes from parent to\noffspring, leading to vertical transmission parallel to genetic\ntransmission. As a final example of multiple channels of inheritance\nnote that cultural transmission in humans and animals, which is\nrequired for the reconstruction of behavioral phenotypes such as bird\nsongs, food preferences, and other cultural traditions (Avital &\nJablonka 2000), may also be considered to constitute supplementary\ninheritance channels.\n\nThe same inheritance system may be used in multiple inheritance\nchannels. For example, the genetic inheritance system as defined by\nJablonka and Lamb is responsible for the inheritance of the\ninformation in the DNA in the eukaryotic nucleus and in the DNA of\nmitochondria. Horizontal gene transfer more generally is considered by\nJablonka and Lamb to belong to the genetic system (Jablonka & Lamb\n2005:. 233), though it typically involves additional vectors or\ntransmission channels. Conversely, a single inheritance channel may\ninvolve multiple inheritance systems, in the sense used by Jablonka\nand Lamb. For example, DNA methylation, an epigenetic mark, copied in\ncellular epigentic inheritance, is tied to the copying and\ntransmission of DNA. This arguably constitutes a single channel.\nEpigenetic mechanisms and heredity play a role in various properties\nof the genetic system, affecting things such as mutation and\nrecombination rates and hence genetic variation. Perhaps more\nfundamentally, epigenetic mechanisms are part of the mechanisms\n\u2018operating\u2019 the genetic channel. The inheritance of the\ngenome, when a cell divides, involves recreation of the mother\ncell\u2019s epigenetic state, a process that goes beyond copying\n(Lamm 2011, 2014; Lamm & Jablonka 2008).\n\nWhile many interesting cases involve identifying new inheritance\nchannels which are based on new inheritance systems, and discussions\nare often ambiguous as to which of the two notions they refer to, the\nstudy of inheritance systems is a separate endeavor from the analysis\nof the inheritance channels affecting individual organisms or traits.\nThe holistic view about inheritance, found in Developmental Systems\nTheory, rejects both the analysis of inheritance in terms of multiple\nsystems and in terms of multiple channels, arguing that both\ndistinctions are at most convenient idealizations (Griffiths &\nGray 2001), and it is not unusual for debates about holism to conflate\nthe discussion of the two issues. DST proponents argue that some\ndevelopmental resources are not easily represented as channels,\nespecially persistent resources, that holism is more heuristically\nproductive, and that channels are not statistically independent\ninformation carriers (Griffiths & Gray 2001; see also the useful\ndiscussion by Griesemer et al. (2005: 526)).\n\nIn response to the DST rejection of multiple channel accounts of\ninheritance, Griesemer et al. (2005) note the multiple ways in which\nchannels can be independent from one another. Channels may be\nindividuated as separate channels physically, chemically, or\nbiologically, regardless of whether they are statistically independent\ninformation channels. Additionally, causal independence should not be\nrequired for individuating inheritance channels. While Jablonka and\nLamb use a notion of biological information to characterize\ninheritance systems, they are not individuated based on statistical\nindependence, but rather mechanistically (or, more accurately,\nmechanismically, that is by identifying classes of inheritance\nmechanisms) and by biological function.\n3.2 Identifying and delimiting inheritance systems\n\nAs it is hereditary variations that are needed for evolution via\nnatural selection, Jablonka and Lamb set out to study different\ninheritance systems (where system is understood roughly to\nmean a set of interacting factors and mechanisms) by identifying\ndifferent kinds of hereditary variation (Jablonka 2001; Jablonka &\nLamb 1995, 2005/2014). Their approach can be described as focused on\nthe mechanismic basis for different types of hereditary phenotypic\nvariation. They have identified multiple inheritance systems, each\nwith several modes of transmission, that have different properties,\nand that interact and coevolve (Jablonka 2001: 100; Jablonka &\nLamb 2005/2014). The systems are said to carry information, defined as\nthe transmissible organization of an actual or potential state of a\nsystem. A detailed account of their mechanismic classification is\npresented in\n section 3.3.\n\nA different approach to characterizing and possibly for identifying\nand delimiting inheritance systems posits that to count as an\ninheritance system a system has to have evolved for the purpose of\ntransmitting hereditary information, i.e., to have the\n\u201cmeta-function\u201d of producing heritable phenotypes (Shea\n2007). In this respect this approach is reminiscent of the extended\nreplicator approach of Sterelny et al. (1996). Other requirements that\nhave been proposed in the literature are the demand for\n\u201cunlimited\u201d heredity, i.e., unlimited repertoire of\nvariants the system can store and transmit, needed for sustained or\ncumulative evolution (see discussion in Godfrey-Smith 2000; Maynard\nSmith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995: 43), and the ability to generate\nfine-grained response to selection (see Griffiths 2001: 460). Both\nthese requirements regard genetic inheritance as having a privileged\nrole in development and evolution in comparison with epigenetic\ninheritance processes. Jablonka and Lamb address these concerns with\nevolvability by noting that multiple instances of limited systems of\ninheritance may exist within one cell (e.g., multiple self-sustaining\nmetabolic cycles), thus extending the repertoire of hereditary\nvariations, and by emphasizing the effects limited hereditary systems\ncan have on the evolution of genetic variations (see the discussion of\ngenetic assimilation below). Jablonka also argues that the requirement\nfor high fidelity of replication (e.g., Sterelny 2001) is not as\nnecessary for inheritance systems that employ filtering mechanisms\nthat ensure that transmitted variations are typically adaptive\n(Jablonka 2002). For further discussion of the requirement for\nevolvability see the discussion of Sterelny\u2019s Hoyle conditions\nin\n section 4.6.\n\nIt should be noted that all the properties discussed above are\nproperties of systems, not properties of particular hereditary\nrelations, of particular transmission events, or of replicator\ntokens.\n3.3 Mechanismic Classification of Inheritance Systems\n\nJablonka and Lamb characterize four broadly defined inheritance\nsystems: two fairly specific inheritance systems \u2014 the\ngenetic inheritance system and the symbolic inheritance\nsystem found in human languages \u2014 and two classes of\ninheritance systems \u2014 cellular and organismal epigenetic\ninheritance systems and behavioral inheritance systems.\nThe systems are classified and grouped according to the way they store\nand transmit variations and by the properties of the hereditary\nrelations they give rise to.\n\nJablonka and Lamb\u2019s classification of inheritance systems on the\nbasis of their mechanismic differences is not the only classification\napproach which focuses on hereditary variations. Recently,\nHelanter\u00e4 & Uller (2010) analyzed the inheritance systems\nJablonka and Lamb identified based on their evolutionary consequences.\nThey claim that Jablonka and Lamb\u2019s mechanismic classification\ndoes not match a classification of means of inheritance according to\ntheir evolutionary properties, and suggested classifying them into\nthree categories: vertical transmission which covers cases in\nwhich traits are transmitted from parent to offspring such as genetic\ninheritance and some epigenetic phenomena; induction which\ncovers cases in which the environment determines change between parent\nand offspring such as induced genetic mutations and maternal effects;\nand acquisition which covers cases in which traits originate\nfrom non-parental individuals or other sources, for example horizontal\ngene transfer and various forms of learning. Similarly, Day and\nBonduriansky (2011), using a unified framework based on the Price\nEquation, have argued that while the diversity of inheritance\nmechanisms is very large they give rise to a much more limited set of\ninheritance patterns, characterized as unique combinations of\nreproductive transmission rules.\n\nThe properties of the inheritance systems that Jablonka and Lamb chose\nto study are those they deemed to be most pertinent for understanding\ninheritance, and its evolutionary consequences (Jablonka 2001: 100).\nIn more recent work Jablonka and Lamb (2005/2014) distinguish between\nproperties of the way information is reproduced, and properties\nrelated to whether variation is targeted, responsive to the\nenvironment, or otherwise biased (the so-called \u201cLamarckian\ndimension\u201d). Among the properties of reproduction of information\nthat they identify are whether reproduction results from ordinary\ncellular activity and relies on general purpose cellular mechanisms or\nwhether a dedicated copying system (i.e., cellular machinery) exists;\nwhether the inheritance system can transmit latent (unexpressed)\ninformation or is information necessarily expressed phenotypically;\nand whether information is transmitted solely to offspring (referred\nto as vertical transmission) or to neighbors as well\n(horizontal transmission).\n\nThe properties related to targeting, constructing, and planning of\ntransmitted variation that Jablonka and Lamb identify are:\n\nIs variation targeted, in the sense that the production of\nvariants is biased towards producing some possible variants (i.e.,\n\u201cnon-random\u201d)?\nIs variation subject to developmental filtering and modification\nbefore transmission, as found for example in behavioral\ninheritance?\nIs variation constructed through direct planning by the\norganisms?\nCan variations change the selective environment, for example by\nchanging the environmental niche the organism occupies?\n\n\nWe now describe in more detail each of inheritance systems Jablonka\nand Lamb identified. Jablonka\u2019s and Lamb\u2019s analysis of\ninheritance systems is summarized in tables 1 and 2.\n\n\n\nInheritance system\nOrganizations of information\nDedicated copying system?\nTransmits latent (nonexpressed) information?\nDirections of transmission\nRange of variation \n\nGenetic\nModular\nYes\nYes\nMostly vertical\nUnlimited \n\nEpigenetic\n \n\nSelf-sustaining loops\nHolistic\nNo\nNo\nMostly vertical\nLimited at the loop level, unlimited at the cell level\n\n\nStructural templating\nHolistic\nNo\nNo\nMostly vertical\nLimited at the structure level, unlimited at the cell level\n\n\nRNA silencing\nHolistic\nYes\nSometimes\nVertical and sometimes horizontal\nLimited at the single transcript level, unlimited at the cell\nlevel \n\nChromatin marks\nModular and holistic\nYes (for methylation)\nSometimes\nVertical\nUnlimited \n\nOrganism-level developmental legacies\nHolistic\nNo\nNo\nMostly vertical\nLimited \n\nBehavioral\n \n\nBehavior-affecting substances\nHolistic\nNo\nNo\nBoth vertical and horizontal\nLimited at the single behavior level, unlimited for\nlifestyles \n\nNonimitative social learning\nHolistic\nNo\nNo\nBoth vertical and horizontal\nLimited at the single behavior level, unlimited for\nlifestyles \n\nImitation\nModular\nProbably\nNo\nBoth vertical and horizontal\nUnlimited \n\nSymbolic\nModular and holistic\nYes, several\nYes\nBoth vertical and horizontal\nUnlimited \n\n\nTable 1.

Targeting, constructing, and\nplanning transmitted variation\n\n\n(The tables above are reproduced with permission from Eva Jablonka and\nMarion J. Lamb, Evolution In Four Dimensions: Genetic, Epigenetic,\nBehavioral, and Symbolic Variation In The History Of Life, MIT\nPress 2005.)\n3.3.1 The Genetic Inheritance System (GIS)\n\nThe genetic inheritance system (GIS) uses the nucleotide sequence in\nnucleic acids, typically DNA, to store and transmit information (i.e.,\nhereditary variation), and includes the machinery responsible for DNA\nreplication, error correction etc. The GIS uses encoded\ninformation, as nucleotide sequences code for amino acids that form\nproteins using the genetic code which specifies which amino acid\ncorresponds to each triplet of nucleotides (called a codon). The DNA\nsequence also specifies functional RNA molecules. DNA nucleotides can\nbe modified independently of each other, a property referred to as\nmodular organization; it has been argued that coded\ninformation requires modular replication (Szathm\u00e1ry 2000).\nGenerally speaking, the genetic system provides unlimited\nheredity, since the nucleotide sequence is not limited in size,\nand each position in it can contain any nucleotide. These,\nparticularly the claim that the sequence length is unconstrained, are\nof course idealized assumptions. Unlimited heredity and modularity are\nmost often attributed to the genetic system as a whole, not only to\nprotein coding regions, and it is often argued that they are unique to\nit. Like the GIS, the symbolic inheritance system (discussed below),\nwhich is restricted to human beings, exhibits unlimited and modular\nheredity.\n\nVarious kinds of regulatory regions in DNA are spread throughout most\ngenomes. They comprise \u201cnon-coding\u201d sequences, in the\nsense that they do not code for proteins and do not depend on the\ngenetic code. Regulatory regions affect gene expression and chromatin\ndynamics. It is still debated in the scientific community whether\nthere are general properties of sequence organization that determine\nthese functions, which would suggest a high-order code. It should be\nnoted that various non-coding sequences interact in specific ways with\nepigenetic mechanisms (such as DNA methylation and histone\nmodifications) in order to produce their regulatory effects. The\ngenome which is the seat of genetic information is also a focal point\nfor the operation of critical epigenetic mechanisms, and it may turn\nout not to be possible to fully understand the properties of the\ngenetic inheritance system and its evolution in isolation from\nepigenetic inheritance (Jablonka & Lamb 2008; Lamm 2011,\n2014).\n\nSome mechanisms that generate variation in DNA are invoked in\nparticular conditions (e.g., stress conditions), and produce variation\nthat is non-random in location and/or pattern (e.g., Levy &\nFeldman 2004; reviewed in Jablonka & Lamb 2005: chap. 3). However,\nit is widely perceived that most genetic variations are the result of\nnon-directed processes that are not responsive to specific inducing\nconditions.\n3.3.2 Epigenetic Inheritance Systems (EISs)\n\nEpigenetic inheritance occurs when environmentally-induced and\ndevelopmentally-regulated variations, or variations that are the\nresult of developmental noise, are transmitted to subsequent\ngenerations of cells or organisms (Jablonka & Lamb 2005). The term\nepigenetic inheritance is used in a broad sense and in a narrow sense.\nThe narrow sense refers to the systems that underlie cellular\nheredity. Four EISs in the narrow sense are discussed by Jablonka and\nLamb (2005/2014): (1) Self-sustaining steady-states of metabolic\ncycles. Transmission of the components of the cycle, such as proteins\nand metabolites, can lead to reconstruction of the cycle in the\ndaughter cell. Self-sustaining loops can also maintain the\ntranscription levels of genes. For example, a transcriptional\nself-sustaining loop is most likely responsible for white-opaque\nswitching in Candida albicans, a change in phenotypic state\nthat involves a change in cell appearance, mating behavior, and\npreferred host tissues that is heritable for many generations. (2)\nStructural inheritance of cell structures, such as cellular membranes\nand the cilia on the cell surface of ciliates. (3) Chromatin marking\nof various kinds that consists of molecular marks on chromosomes\n(specifically, DNA methylation and histone modifications, which\ninvolve chemical groups attached to DNA and to proteins around which\nthe DNA molecules are wrapped in eukaryotic cells). Some of these\nmarks are copied by dedicated copying machinery, others seem to be\nreconstructed as a result of regular genome dynamics from partial\nmarkings transmitted to daughter cells (e.g., Henikoff, Furuyama,\n& Ahmad 2004; reviewed in Lamm 2014). (4) Inheritance of small RNA\nmolecules that affect gene expression. The most well-known case\ninvolves RNA silencing (RNAi), a post-transcriptional silencing\nmechanism, though more and more classes of regulatory RNA molecules\nand related pathways are being identified and characterized.\n\nEpigenetics in the broad sense refers to two kinds of inheritance. (1)\nCellular epigenetic inheritance through mitotic cells and\ntransgenerational epigenetic inheritance through meiotic cells.\nTransgenerational heredity of DNA methylation has been observed in\nunicellular organisms, plants, and mammals, suggesting that\ntransgenerational epigenetic inheritance may be more prevalent than\noften suspected (Jablonka & Raz 2009). (2) Hereditary effects that\nby-pass the germline, for example through early developmental inputs\nthat lead to regeneration of previous developmental conditions (e.g.,\nhormonal and neural conditions) and other forms of phenotypic\ntransmission, such as the transmission of symbionts and\nparasites, e.g., gut bacteria (Jablonka & Raz 2009).\n\nIn transgenerational epigenetic transmission, alternative phenotypes\ncan persist for several, possibly many, generations, though their\npersistence may be more limited than that of genetic changes. They may\nthus have evolutionary effects in addition to the role played by\ncellular epigenetic inheritance in the development of multi-cellular\norganisms that was noted above. Generally, epigenetic inheritance\npiggybacks on general developmental and physiological mechanisms of\ncells, and is a by product of other physiological functions, not the\nresult of an independent copying system that is content neutral; DNA methylation is a\nnotable exception. Epigenetic inheritance typically is\nholistic rather than modular in its storage and transmission\n(i.e., it is not comprised of units of information that can be changed\nindependently of one another), and supports a limited\nrepertoire of hereditary variants (e.g., the steady-states of a\nmetabolic cycle). However, one cell may include many instances of\nindependent self-sustaining metabolic cycles and structurally\ntransmitted cellular components, for example, increasing the\nrepertoire of cellular variations that can be inherited via these\nforms of inheritance. Typically, EISs (with some exceptions, such as\nDNA methylation) cannot transmit unexpressed (latent) information,\nalthough the transmission of partial factors or marks, which are not\nsufficient for expression, may be reliably sufficient when additional\ndevelopmental factors are added.\n3.3.3 Behavioral Inheritance Systems (BISs)\n\nJablonka and Lamb (Jablonka 2001; Jablonka & Lamb 2005) focus on\nthree types of behavioral inheritance: (1) Inheritance of\nbehavior-affecting substances. The inducing substances bias the\nbehavior of offspring leading to limited behavioral heredity. A\nparadigmatic case is the \u201ctransmission\u201d of food\npreferences from mother to offspring via molecular cues passed through\nthe placenta. (2) Non-imitative social learning that leads to\nsimilarity in behavior. Here, naive organisms learn through\ninteraction with environmental circumstances that elicit particular\nbehavior and by observing the behavior of experienced adults, though\nnot by copying or imitating their behavior. A famous case of\nnon-imitative social learning involved the spread of milk-bottle\nopening behavior in blue tits and great tits. It appears that the\nbehavior spread through the contact of birds with open milk-bottles or\nwith experienced birds using bottles as food sources, not by imitating\nthe method of opening the bottles. (3) Imitation and instruction. In\ncontrast with the other behavioral inheritance systems, imitation is\nmodular (behavioral patterns are imitated independently of other\npatterns in the same behavioral sequence) and may depend on a\ndedicated copying system or systems.\n\nWhile the GIS and EISs transmit information mostly from parent to\noffspring (i.e., vertically), all behavioral inheritance\nsystems are directly or indirectly influenced by the social\nenvironment, and are thus capable of transmitting information to\nneighbors as well, that is horizontally. A second property\nshared by behavioral forms of inheritance is that for a behavior to be\ntransmitted it has to be expressed.\n3.3.4 The Symbolic Inheritance System (SIS)\n\nThe symbolic inheritance system refers to all symbolic communication,\nbut mainly to linguistic communication, and is unique to humans. The\nsymbolic inheritance system shares some properties with the genetic\ninheritance system, notably modularity, unlimited\nvariability, the use of coded information, and the\ncapacity to transmit latent information. Its origins are in\nbehavioral inheritance and it shares some of the properties of\nbehavioral inheritance, in particular the capacity for horizontal\ntransmission and developmental filtering of variation\nprior to transmission.\n\nJablonka and Lamb\u2019s account of cultural evolution in humans\nappeals to the properties of symbolic inheritance, most critically\nthat variations are not blindly copied but rather reconstructed by\nlearners in ways that are sensitive to meaning, social context, and\nthe history of the individuals involved (Jablonka & Lamb\n2005/2014). They contrast their view with the meme based account of\ncultural evolution presented by Dawkins and Blackmore (e.g., Blackmore\n1999), which takes cultural items to be stored in human brains and\ntransmitted to other human agents in the form of faithful replication,\nand cultural change to involve the differential success of replication\nof the different cultural items. Jablonka and Lamb argue that focusing\non replication and selection rather than on the generation of variants\nand on reconstruction processes is particularly harmful for\nunderstanding cultural evolution.\n3.4 Niche Construction Theory and Ecological Inheritance\n\nNiche construction theory (Odling-Smee, Laland, & Feldman 2003)\nespouses the notion of ecological inheritance through which\nprevious generations as well as current neighbors can affect organisms\nby altering the external environment or niche that they experience.\nThis purportedly creates an inheritance channel that operates in\nparallel with genetic inheritance. Ecological inheritance is defined\nas the inheritance of selection pressures that were modified by niche\nconstruction activities (Odling-Smee 2010: 176). Niche construction\nleads to ecological inheritance if changes to the ecological niche\npersist or accumulate and establish modified selection pressures. Note\nthat while the notion of ecological inheritance suggests viewing niche\nconstruction as a transmission process, the focus on the modifications\ndone to the niche highlights persistence. Extending the notion of\necological inheritance to the realm of development, Odling-Smee (2010:\n181) defines niche inheritance as the inheritance of an\ninitial organism-environment relationship, or \u201cniche,\u201d\nfrom ancestors. Niche inheritance can thus affect organisms\u2019\ndevelopment directly, rather than through selection. For a recent\ndiscussion of the differences between selective niche construction and\ndevelopmental niche construction see Stotz (2017).\n\nOdling-Smee et al. (2003) note that ecological inheritance \u201cmore\nclosely resembles the inheritance of territory or property than it\ndoes the inheritance of genes.\u201d In particular, it includes\ntransmission of material resources that are difficult to construe as\ninformational. Odling-Smee (2010: 181) enumerates fundamental\ndifferences between ecological inheritance and genetic inheritance:\n(1) Ecological inheritance is transmitted through an external\nenvironment. It is not transmitted by reproduction. (2) Ecological\ninheritance need not depend on the transmission of discrete\nreplicators (though this mechanism is not ruled out). (3) Ecological\ninheritance is continuously transmitted by multiple organisms, to\nmultiple other organisms, within and between generations, throughout\nthe lifetime of organisms. (4) Ecological inheritance is not always\ntransmitted by genetic relatives. It should be noted that some of\nthese properties of ecological inheritance are shared by extra-genetic\ninheritance more generally.\n\nOdling-Smee (2010) distinguishes two transmission channels:\ntransmission through direct connection during reproduction between the\ninternal environments of parent and offspring and transmission through\nan external environment. In channel 1, the internal environment,\nOdling-Smee includes Jablonka\u2019s and Lamb\u2019s genetic and\nepigenetic inheritance systems, and some kinds of maternal effects. In\nchannel 2, transmission through an external environment, he includes\nthe inheritance of modified selection pressures in the external\nenvironments of organisms as a consequence of prior communicative\nniche construction, and includes Jablonka\u2019s and Lamb\u2019s\nbehavioral and symbolic inheritance systems. All the inheritance\nsystems just mentioned transmit semantic information, according to\nOdling-Smee. In addition, both transmission channels are used to\ntransmit energy and matter. Cytoplasmic inheritance of various kinds,\nand some kinds of maternal effects, are considered by Odling-Smee to\nbe energy and material resources transmitted through the internal\nenvironment, and traditional ecological inheritance of selection\npressures is non-semantic inheritance that is passed through an\nexternal environment.\n4. Developmental and Evolutionary Implications\n\nOne of the best arguments for studying heredity through the\nperspective afforded by multiple inheritance systems is that this\nperspective opens up questions about the evolutionary and\ndevelopmental relations and interactions between the various\ninheritance systems that are characterized. Among these questions are\nquestions about whether each system creates new targets of selection,\nabout the ways in which inheritance systems may provide developmental\nscaffolding for other inheritance systems, about the regulatory role\nthey may have in relation to one another, and about the evolution of\ninheritance systems. We now turn to these issues.\n\nNon-genetic inheritance can have an effect on the ecological\nconditions an organism faces by affecting or determining behavior and\nactivities, thus increasing or dampening selection. The result is a\nfeedback loop between actions of the organism and selection that leads\nto what Conrad Waddington referred to as the cybernetic nature of\nevolution (Waddington 1961). Behavioral and symbolic inheritance, in\nparticular, can reinforce this process. By thus affecting the\nselective challenges faced by the organism, the evolutionary feedback\nloop can turn short-term hereditary effects, that would not survive\nmany generations, into long term evolutionary change.\n Section 4.4\n further discusses the ramifications of this phenomenon.\n\nJablonka and Lamb (2005/2014) present a general account of biological\nevolution based on the multiple inheritance systems perspective. They\nargue that evolution can occur through any of the inheritance systems\nthey identify (e.g., the behavioral) without necessarily involving\ngenetic changes. This can happen through natural selection operating\non non-genetic hereditary variations. Epigenetic changes are usually\ngenerated at a higher rate than genetic changes, often as a result of\nchanges in environmental conditions, and the variation that is\ngenerated may have a higher chance of being beneficial than blind\nvariation. This may allow rapid adaptation to changing conditions.\nThese claims apply to behavioral inheritance and symbolic inheritance\nas well. Shea, Pen, & Uller (2011) distinguish between the\nadaptation resulting from selection on epigenetic variations, which\nthey term selection-based effects, and the adaptation\nresulting from induced response to the environment, which they term\ndetection-based effects, and discuss their evolutionary and\ndevelopmental consequences. Selection-based effects lead to adaptation\nvia natural selection operating on reliably transmitted epigenetic\nvariations and are analogous to the selection-based effects of genetic\ninheritance, though epigenetic variation may occur more rapidly and\nits frequency may increase due to environmental challenges.\nDetection-based effects, in contrast, are the result of directional\nvariation and are a form of phenotypic plasticity.\n\nWhile Jablonka\u2019s and Lamb\u2019s approach is similar to that of\nMaynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry (Maynard Smith &\nSzathm\u00e1ry 1995), in that Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\nfocus on changes in the way hereditary information is stored and\ntransmitted, Jablonka and Lamb argue that Maynard Smith and\nSzathm\u00e1ry neglect the evolutionary role played by distinct\ninformation-transmitting systems. In particular, they argue that\nMaynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\u2019s approach neglects the role\nof instructive processes, of the sort typically found in EISs, BISs,\nand the SIS, which lead to induced hereditary changes that are acted\nupon by natural selection (Jablonka & Lamb 2005: 343). Maynard\nSmith and Szathm\u00e1ry, in contrast, argue that even with the\nexistence of epigenetic inheritance processes, natural selection\nworking on mutations that are typically not adaptive (i.e.,\nnon-directed) remains the fundamental evolutionary process (Maynard\nSmith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995: 249).\n4.1 Units of Selection\n\nOnce it is accepted that more than one inheritance system or,\nalternatively, more than one independently inherited replicator may be\ninvolved in the reproduction of organisms (let alone multiple kinds of\nreplicators), questions about units of selection have to be addressed.\nAs each inheritance system can lead to hereditary variations, there\nmay be multiple lineages related to the production of a single\norganism and even single phenotypic traits. Evolution may happen in\neach lineage, and, in particular, each lineage may be\n\u201ctracked\u201d by natural selection.\n\nAccording to the traditional view in evolutionary theory selection\noperates on individual organisms. This view can incorporate multiple\ninheritance systems and channels within a single evolutionary process\nby viewing each inheritance system or channel as providing\ndevelopmental resources for the construction of individual organisms,\nleading to a single evolutionary process operating on lineages of\norganisms (qua interactors). Alternatively, lineages of phenotypic\ntraits that may be affected by more than one inheritance system or\nchannel may be subject to selection. According to this view phenotypic\ntraits are the targets or units of selection (Jablonka 2004).\n\nAccording to views that explain evolution in terms of replicators,\nmultiple kinds of replicators can support multiple and distinct\nevolutionary processes. The most prominent example of this line of\nthought concerns the view that genes are supplemented by memes that\nare units of cultural transmission, and each is manifested in a\nseparate evolutionary process: biological evolution operating on\nlineages of genes and cultural evolution operating on lineages of\nmemes. The extended replicator framework, in contrast, accepts the\npossibility of multiple kinds of replicators, but considers a single\nevolutionary process that determines the fate of lineages of different\nkinds of replicators by the success of their associated interactors\nand extended phenotypic effects (Sterelny et al. 1996: 378).\n4.2 Scaffolding\n\nWilliam Wimsatt and James Griesemer (2007) discuss multi-channel\ninheritance using the notion of scaffolding from\ndevelopmental psychology. Scaffolding refers to structures and\nfunctional processes that provide a supporting framework for\ndevelopment (see Caporael et al. 2013). Traits inherited through one\ninheritance system can provide scaffolding for other inheritance\nsystems. Wimsatt and Griesemer suggest that if the flow of information\nmust be scaffolded in such a way that carriers develop in appropriate\nconditions in order to assimilate, use, and carry the information,\nthen the scaffolding must propagate or persist alongside the\ninformation in the channel \u2014 leading to multi-channel\ninheritance (Wimsatt & Griesemer 2007: 286). They suggest that\nthis applies to any information that is sufficiently complex. As a\nconsequence it applies essentially to all biological and cultural\nphenomena.\n\nA related notion is suggested by Peter Godfrey-Smith, who defines\nscaffolded reproducers as \u201centities which get\nreproduced as part of the reproduction of some larger unit (a simple\nreproducer), or that are reproduced by some other entity\u201d\n(Godfrey-Smith 2009: 88). This notion is more restricted than\nWimsatt\u2019s and Griesemer\u2019s appeal to scaffolding, as it\nonly refers to scaffolding of reproduction. Godfrey-Smith classifies\ngenes as scaffolded reproducers since they rely on cellular machinery\nfor their reproduction (p. 130).\n4.3 The ontogeny of inheritance systems\n\nInheritance systems themselves develop so as to be able to store,\ntransmit, and receive hereditary information. Put differently, the\ninheritance of the capacity for inheritance may itself involve\ndevelopmental reconstruction processes. These developmental processes\nmay depend on two types of resources: resources and cues from other\ninheritance channels (e.g., the genetic system specifies elements of\nthe brain, which are required for behavioral inheritance), and cues\nthat are transmitted through the same channel and affect its further\ndevelopment (e.g., linguistic cues affecting linguistic abilities).\nRecent research on chromatin dynamics makes it clear that genetic\ninheritance relies on multiple epigenetic mechanisms, and suggests\nthat we should be cautious with the distinction between a genetic\ninheritance system and cellular epigenetic inheritance systems (Lamm\n2011, 2014).\n\nAn interesting example from recent research is the suggestion that\nsensorimotor experience plays a role in the development of the\ncapacity for imitation in the human brain (Catmur, Walsh, & Heyes\n2009). It is argued that if this model is correct, then \u201chuman\nimitation is not only a channel, but also a product of cultural\ninheritance\u201d (Catmur et al. 2009: 2376), since imitation not\nonly takes part in cultural inheritance, it is shaped by it as well.\nThus, cultural inheritance may provide scaffolding for the development\nof imitation abilities in humans, which further affect behavioral and\ncultural inheritance.\n4.4 Assimilation\n\nOne of the most interesting ways in which multiple inheritance systems\ncan interact evolutionarily is through processes such as the\nBaldwin Effect and genetic assimilation. These\nnotions purport to explain how selection can drive developmental\nresponses to environmental demands to become less dependent on the\npresence of the external stimuli, and become increasingly hereditary\n(see Ancel 1999, 2000; Crispo 2007; Scheiner 2014, Weber & Depew\n2003). In these processes, non-genetic variants affect the selection\nof genetic variations in favor of those that produce congruent\nphenotypic results (Jablonka & Lamb 2005/2014: chap. 7). In the\nsimplest case, originally discussed by Baldwin, a developmental\nresponse to the environment allows organisms to survive and reproduce\nfor enough generations for genetic mutations to accumulate through\nnatural selection and make the developmental accommodation to the\nexternal stimulus unnecessary. The genetic mutations that are favored\nare those that act in tandem with the developmental response. Conrad\nWaddington characterized a process he termed genetic\nassimilation leading to similar results, but emphasized the role\nplayed by changes in combinations of genes and reorganization of\ngenetic networks following the reshuffling of genes during the sexual\nprocess. The developmentally produced variants that lead the\nassimilation process need not be hereditary, and may be the result of\nrecurrent plastic developmental responses in each generation. When\nthey are hereditary, however, their inheritance can reinforce their\nspread in the population.\n\nA similar phenomenon can result from processes of niche construction,\nwhich affect the selective environment faced by organisms and their\ndescendants (Odling-Smee et al. 2003). A particularly well known\nexample of the possible effects of cultural niche construction on\ngenetic evolution is the relationship between a history of dairy\nfarming in a culture and the prevalence of adults with a genetic\nvariant enabling them to continuously produce lactase, the enzyme\nneeded to digest fresh milk (Durham 1991; Mace 2009). This example\nillustrates how cultural evolution can drive genetic evolution, a\nelement of gene-culture coevolution.\n\nPhenomena such as these may be characterized as being\n\u201cLamarckian\u201d in flavor, even though they operate according\nto traditional Darwinian theory, since they provide room for\ninstructive or induced processes in evolution. The epigenetic,\nbehavioral, and symbolic dimensions in evolution discussed by Jablonka\nand Lamb produce induced variation which may affect evolution through\nprocesses of assimilation as well as through their hereditary affects.\nIn this way various inheritance systems other than the genetic can\nindirectly affect the evolution of genetic traits.\n\nAssimilation may typically result in the response being partially\nrather than entirely independent of external stimuli. In other words,\nthe response may become less dependent on external stimuli, and more\nbiased in favor of particular results, without becoming automatic.\nJablonka and Lamb call this phenomenon partial assimilation\n(Jablonka & Lamb 2005: 290), and see it as particularly important\nfor understanding the way behavior (BISs) and language (the SIS)\naffect the evolution of mind. A further mechanism, identified by\nAvital and Jablonka, is assimilate and stretch. Here, given a\nlimited and fixed capacity for learning, new learned elements may be\nrecruited, when part of a behavioral sequence that formerly depended\non learning becomes genetically assimilated (Avital & Jablonka\n2000).\n\nAlexander Badyaev suggests an evolutionary continuum of inheritance\nsystems that reflect the extent or stage of assimilation from\nepigenetic (in the broad sense of Jablonka and Lamb) to genetic\ninheritance. Parental effects may be a transient stage along this\ncontinuum, whose assimilation depends on the dynamics of the\nenvironment, and other constraints (Badyaev 2009; Badyaev & Uller\n2009; Helanter\u00e4 & Uller 2010; see also: Yona et al.\n2015).\n\nThe overall picture that emerges from the consideration of\nassimilation is of evolution driven by developmental capacities and\nbiases that affect which genetic mutations are selected. Mary-Jane\nWest-Eberhard summarized this observation with the claim that genes\nare typically followers in evolution rather than the ones leading the\nway (Jablonka 2006; West-Eberhard 2003).\n4.5 Regulation and control\n\nAlready in 1958 David Nanney suggested that the difference between\ngenetic and what we would now call cellular epigenetic inheritance\nlies not in their physical location (i.e., whether they lie in the\nnucleus or the cytoplasm), but rather that the genetic system\nmaintains a set of \u201clibrary specifications\u201d while the\nepigenetic control system (to use his terminology) determines\nwhich specificities are expressed in each particular cell, accounting\nfor cell differentiation (Nanney 1958). Thus, according to Nanney, the\nepigenetic inheritance system plays a regulatory role in relation to\nthe genetic system.\n\nConsidering epigenetic control systems as providing a regulatory\nfunction allowed Nanney to suggest that they may be expected to (1) be\nless stable, (2) be more susceptible to extrinsic control than genetic\nsystems, and (3) exhibit a limited number of \u201cstates\u201d,\nsince they are constrained by the information available in the genetic\nsystem at each particular time (Nanney 1958). These properties are\nindeed exhibited by the cellular epigenetic systems that have since\nbeen identified, which play a role in cellular (e.g., genomic)\nregulation. DNA methylation and histone modifications can lead to gene\nsilencing, for example. The transgenerational hereditary properties of\nepigenetic markings may be subsequent to their regulatory function;\nhowever, in multicellular organisms, transgenerational heredity of\nepigenetic marks is constrained by their developmental role, since\nparental epigenetic markings may have to be reset in gametes so that\nthey can fulfill their developmental function anew in offspring (Shea\net al. 2011; see also Lachmann & Libby 2016).\n4.6 Evolution of Inheritance Systems\n\nVarious suggestions have been made about the evolutionary history\nunderlying the multiple systems of inheritance that have been\nidentified and about their role in the evolution of life. In general,\nepigenetic inheritance allows rapid response to inducing stimuli and\nmay be more advantageous than mutation/selection cycles in specific\ntypes of fluctuating environments. This may be particularly important\nin small populations and diploid organisms, in which mutations are\ntypically recessive (Nanney 1960). Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\nargued that evolution typically moves from limited to unlimited\nsystems of inheritance or, to use their conceptual framework, from\nlimited to unlimited hereditary replicators, and from holistic to\nmodular replication (Maynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995;\nSzathm\u00e1ry 2000, 2015). This evolutionary trend is manifested in\nthe major transitions in evolution to new levels of individuality (and\nnew kinds of inheritance) that they have characterized. However, the\nco-existence of multiple systems of inheritance and its evolutionary\nsignificance is downplayed by such an account. Jablonka and Lamb\n(Jablonka 1994; Jablonka & Lamb 2006), in contrast, emphasize the\nrole played by inheritance systems other than the genetic, in\nparticular by epigenetic inheritance, in evolutionary transitions.\nThey place particular importance on the role of epigenetic inheritance\nin the evolution of multi-cellularity (see also Maynard Smith 1990;\nNanney 1958, 1960; Shea et al. 2011) and in the evolution of the\nchromosome (Jablonka & Lamb 2006). Nanney (1960) suggested that\nepigenetic inheritance played a role in cell specialization in\nunicellular populations (colonies), which conferred economic benefits\nto individual cells and enabled populations to survive environmental\ntraumas due to their heterogeneity, prior to the emergence of true\nmulti-cellularity. In addition, Jablonka (Jablonka 2001: 113) argues\nthat with the evolution of repair and compensatory mechanisms\ninheritance systems become more limited. Two ways around the\nevolutionary stasis that would result are the move to higher levels of\nindividuality (Jablonka 1994), and the transition to coded\ninformation. Ruth Sager (1966) suggested it may be adaptive to use\ninheritance systems minimizing variability to control traits that are\ncrucial for survival.\n\nKim Sterelny (2001) presented a set of requirements that an\ninheritance system (\u201creplication system,\u201d in his words)\nshould meet if it is to support evolvability. Three fundamental\nproperties are necessary: (1) blocking outlaws; (2) stable\ntransmission of phenotypes; (3) generation of variation. Using these\nhigh-level desiderata, Sterelny articulates a series of nine\nconditions, called the Hoyle-conditions after Sterelny\u2019s thought\nexperiment: a vertical, i.e., \u201conly to offspring and from\nparents\u201d (C1), simultaneous (C2), and unbiased transmission (C3)\nof components (or replicators) that are irreversibly committed to\ntheir biological role as replicators (C4). Further, to ensure\nstability, replication has to be high-fidelity (C5), and the mapping\nbetween replicators and system organization (i.e, \u201cthe\ngenotype-phenotype map\u201d) has to be robust (C6). The requirement\nto support the generation of variation is cashed out in terms of being\nable to support a large, if not unlimited, set of variants or, in\nSterelny\u2019s framework, replicators (C7), having a\n\u201csmooth\u201d (quasi-continuous) mapping between replicators\nand system organization, i.e., small changes should result in small\neffects on organization (C8). Finally, the generation of biological\norganization from replicators should be modular (C9), in the sense\nthat each replicator or small group of replicators should be\nresponsible for only one or a few traits. Whether an inheritance\nsystem fulfills the Hoyle conditions is a matter of degree. Clearly,\nthe genetic system comes closest to meeting the full set of Hoyle\nconditions. Responding to Sterelny\u2019s arguments, Griesemer et al.\nargue that we should direct our attention to the evolution of\ninheritance systems (Griesemer et al. 2005). They note that the Hoyle\nconditions are a product of evolution, not a necessary precondition\nfor inheritance that can support evolvability. In addition, they point\nout that the Hoyle conditions may be met in a distributed\nmanner, that is by multiple inheritance systems each of which fails to\nmeet the criteria on its own but that together give rise to the\nrequired properties. Griesemer et al. also argue that the Hoyle\nconditions may conflict: satisfying one may limit the ability to\nsatisfy others.\n\nA significant aspect of the evolution of inheritance systems that is\nneglected by most contemporary accounts is the relationship between\nproperties of populations and fine-grained properties of inheritance\nsystems, in particular the relationship between the properties of\ninheritance systems and the mating strategies of species. The\nphenotypic variations produced by an inheritance system depend on\npopulation level considerations such as these which determine, in the\ngenetic case, the frequency of heterozygotes (and hence the\nsignificance of dominance and recessivity) and the probability that\ncalibrated gene networks will not be disrupted by sexual reproduction\n(e.g., because genes are adjacent on the chromosome or because the\nalleles are fixed in the relevant population). Population-level\nconsiderations also apply to the analysis of epigenetic variation and\ninheritance. For example, population size may affect the evolutionary\nconsequences of induced epigenetic variation (Rapp & Wendel 2005).\nPopulation level considerations are not typically addressed by\ncontemporary accounts of inheritance systems, yet clearly have\nevolutionary implications.\n\nThis issue was central to Cyril Darlington\u2019s analysis in his\n1939 book The Evolution of Genetic Systems (Darlington 1939).\nDarlington noted that the organization of the karyotype, or the\n\u201cgenetic system\u201d to use his terminology, and its dynamics\nthroughout the mating group, affect the hereditary combinations that\nare produced, and hence hereditary variation, and can lead to\nreproductive isolation and speciation. The following quote gives the\ngeneral flavor of Darlington\u2019s line of thought,\n\n\nThere must be a relationship between the hereditary materials, and\ntheir behaviour, throughout the whole group or species; and it is on\nthis relationship the genetic system depends for its\ncharacter. Hybridity optimum, segregation, and recombination must all\nbe related throughout the group. Furthermore, they must be related not\nmerely amongst themselves, but also to the mating habits of the\nindividuals which compose the group, and to the barriers which make\nthat group by separating or isolating it from others. (Darlington and\nMather 1949: 237; their italics).\n\n\nDarlington argued that the genetic system of a species is connected to\nits preference for inbreeding or outbreeding, since together they\naffect the frequency of heterozygosity (Darlington 1939; Darlington\n& Mather 1949). He noted that Mendelian inheritance establishes a\ncycle between free and potential (latent) genetic variability\n(Darlington & Mather 1949: 276): Potential variability is\ncontained by heterozygotes, while free variability is\nexhibited by the phenotypes of their offspring as a result of\nsegregation. \n5. Conclusions\n\nThe study of inheritance systems attempts to synthesize recent\ndiscoveries about inheritance mechanisms and processes in nature with\nreflection about the nature and dynamics of evolutionary processes.\nThe term \u201cinheritance system\u201d is typically used to refer\nto both mechanisms and factors involved in inheritance, but the term\nlacks a standard definition which goes beyond enumerating various\npurported inheritance systems, and it is unclear if a single\ndefinition can capture the different uses of the term. A principled\ndefinition that determines how inheritance systems are individuated\nand delimited\u2014if indeed they can be\u2014 may be essential for\naddressing many conceptual issues that remain open (see Griesemer et\nal. 2005). The lack of a universally accepted definition may explain\nthe fruitfulness of the term but also suggests approaching the\nliterature with caution.\n\nThe discussion above tried as much as possible to present a unified\nframework for the discussion of inheritance systems that is not tied\nto any particular account. It contrasted the multiple inheritance\nsystems view with monist (i.e., geno-centrism) and holistic views\n(i.e., DST) about inheritance\n (section 1.3)\n and stressed the developmental, mechanism-oriented, perspective on\nreproduction that underlies many discussions of inheritance systems\n(see\n section 2).\n\nThe multiple inheritance system perspective highlights a variety of\nquestions (see\n section 4)\n and many fundamental questions remain open. Some of them depend on\nempirical work, perhaps most importantly determining the prevalence\nand stability of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance\n(Helanter\u00e4 & Uller 2010; Jablonka & Raz 2009; Shea et al.\n2011). The developmental aspects of many of the inheritance systems\ndiscussed in this entry, in particular behavioral inheritance, are\nstill not fully understood. Generally, many open questions remain\nabout the interactions between the various systems and about their\nevolution, in particular the evolution of social learning and the\nevolution of language. A crucial element downplayed by most\ncontemporary accounts is the connection between population level\nissues, such as population size, mating strategies, etc., and the\nproperties of inheritance systems. Addressing these issues requires\nquantitative modeling, and eventually the integration of multiple\ninheritance systems with their different characteristics into\npopulation genetics (see Day & Bonduriansky 2011, Geoghegan &\nSpencer 2012).\n\nSeveral topics that are receiving significant attention in the biology\nresearch community are directly related to the discussion of\ninheritance systems. One is the invigorated field of cultural\nevolution and social learning (see Whiten 2017). A second area is the\ndiscussion of inheritance of regulatory RNA molecules, an epigenetic\ninheritance process that goes beyond the transmission of RNA and\ninvolves developmental re-production (see Veigl 2017). A third area,\nalready receiving significant attention from philosophers, is the\nhereditary properties and function of the microbiome. This is tied to\nthe recent interest in holobionts, a term that refers to assemblages\nof multiple species, notably multi-cellular organisms and bacteria,\nthat form ecological and potentially evolutionary units. It has been\nargued by some researchers that holobionts are units of selection and\nthat the combined genome of the host and symbionts, dubbed \u2018the\nhologenome\u2019, is conceptually analogous to the genome, with the\nbacteria being analogous to genes. Arguably, this inheritance system\nhas Lamarckian dimensions. Other researchers argue that the degree of\nvertical transmission of symbionts is typically too low to qualify the\nholobionts as units of selection. For discussion of these issues see\nHurst (2017), Opstal & Bordenstein (2015), and section IV of\nGissis, Lamm & Shavit (2018). Finally, increasing knowledge of the\ngenetic system itself, in particular the role of chromatin shape and\ndynamics in gene expression as well as in mutation, recombination, and\nother fundamental processes, may lead to new perspectives on the\nrelation between the genetic system and epigenetic mechanisms, and\nimprove our understanding of the transmission of chromatin state.\nArguably, the DNA and non-DNA components of the genome should be seen\nand studied as a dynamic and responsive developmental system (Lamm\n2011, 2014). Moreover, better understanding of how genetic adaptation\nis reached under experimental conditions suggests how physiological\nand epigenetic responses may facilitate adaptation via other means,\nmaking a fitness improving response increasingly more robust, up to\npotentially becoming established via appropriate mutations (Yona et\nal. 2015). These results may lead to rethinking the dichotomy between\nplasticity and evolvability (Lamm & Jablonka 2008) and support the\nidea of \u201cnatural genetic engineering\u201d systems (see Shapiro\n2011). \n\nNon-genetic inheritance can have short term evolutionary effects and\ncan affect genetic evolution (e.g., through genetic assimilation).\nHowever, the long-term and macro-evolutionary significance of\nnon-genetic inheritance, and in particular its effects on the way\npopulations respond to selection is still being debated (e.g.,\nHelanter\u00e4 & Uller 2010: 4). Jablonka\u2019s and Lamb\u2019s\nevolutionary views stress the role of \u201csoft inheritance,\u201d\nor the inheritance of acquired characters, which is exhibited by many\nof the non-genetic inheritance systems. Partly on account of this they\nare among those who raise the need to revise and extend the Modern\nEvolutionary Synthesis (Pigliucci & M\u00fcller 2010). The Modern\nSynthesis marginalized soft inheritance and viewed significant\nevolutionary change to be solely the result of gradual selection\nworking on random variations. The assumptions underlying this view are\nchallenged by work on non-genetic inheritance.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ancel, L. W. (1999).
