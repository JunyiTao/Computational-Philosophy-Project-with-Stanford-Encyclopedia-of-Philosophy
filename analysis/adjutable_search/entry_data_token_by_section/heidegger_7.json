    "main_text": "The Later Philosophy || Technology\n3.3 Technology\n\n\nIn his 1953 piece The Question Concerning Technology,\nHeidegger begins with the everyday account of technology according to\nwhich technology is the vast array of instruments, machines, artefacts\nand devices that we human beings invent, build, and then exploit. On\nthis view technology is basically a tool that we control. Heidegger\nclaims that this everyday account is, in a sense, correct, but it\nprovides only a limited \u201cinstrumental and anthropological\ndefinition\u201d of technology (Question Concerning\nTechnology 312). It depicts technology as a means to an end\n(instrumental) and as a product of human activity (anthropological).\nWhat needs to be exposed and interrogated, however, is something that\nis passed over by the everyday account, namely the essence of\ntechnology. To bring this into view, Heidegger reinterprets his earlier\nnotion of intelligibility in terms of the concept of a\nclearing. A clearing is a region of Being in which things are\nrevealed as mattering in some specific way or another. To identify the\nessence of technology is to lay bare technology as a clearing, that is,\nto describe a technological mode of Being. As Heidegger puts it in the\nContributions (61: 88), \u201c[i]n the context of the\nbeing-question, this word [machination, technology] does not name a\nhuman comportment but a manner of the essential swaying of\nbeing\u201d.\n\n\nSo what is the character of entities as revealed technologically?\nHeidegger's claim is that the \u201crevealing that holds sway\nthroughout modern technology\u2026 [is]\u2026 a challenging\u2026\nwhich puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supply energy\nwhich can be extracted and stored as such\u201d (Question\nConcerning Technology 320). The mode of revealing characteristic\nof modern technology understands phenomena in general\u2014including\nthe non-biological natural world, plants, animals, and indeed human\nbeings\u2014to be no more than what Heidegger calls\nstanding-reserve, that is, resources to be exploited as means\nto ends. This analysis extends to regions of nature and sections of\nsociety that have not yet been harnessed positively as resources. Such\nunexploited elements (e.g., an unexplored jungle, this year's\nunemployed school leavers) exist technologically precisely as\npotential resources.\n\n\nHeidegger's flagship example of technology is a hydroelectric\nplant built on the Rhine river that converts that river into a mere\nsupplier of water power. Set against this \u201cmonstrousness\u201d\n(Question Concerning Technology 321) is the poetic habitation\nof the natural environment of the Rhine as signalled by an old wooden\nbridge that spanned the river for hundreds of years, plus the river as\nrevealed by H\u00f6lderlin's poem \u201cThe Rhine\u201d. In\nthese cases of poetic habitation, natural phenomena are revealed to us\nas objects of respect and wonder. One might think that Heidegger is\nover-reacting here, and that despite the presence of the hydroelectric\nplant, the Rhine in many ways remains a glorious example of natural\nbeauty. Heidegger's response to this complaint is to focus on how\nthe technological mode of Being corrupts the very notion of unspoilt\nareas of nature, by reducing such areas to resources ripe for\nexploitation by the tourist industry. Turning our attention to\ninter-human affairs, the technological mode of Being manifests itself\nwhen, for example, a friendly chat in the bar is turned into networking\n(Dreyfus 1993). And, in the light of Heidegger's analysis, one\nmight smile wryly at the trend for companies to take what used to be\ncalled \u2018personnel\u2019 departments, and to rename them\n\u2018human resources\u2019. Many other examples could be given, but\nthe general point is clear. The primary phenomenon to be understood is\nnot technology as a collection of instruments, but rather technology as\na clearing that establishes a deeply instrumental and, as Heidegger\nsees it, grotesque understanding of the world in general. Of course, if\ntechnological revealing were a largely restricted phenomenon,\ncharacteristic of isolated individuals or groups, then\nHeidegger's analysis of it would be of limited interest. The\nsting in the tale, however, is that, according to Heidegger,\ntechnological revealing is not a peripheral aspect of Being. Rather, it\ndefines our modern way of living, at least in the\nWest.\n\n\nAt this point one might pause to wonder whether technology really is\nthe structure on which we should be concentrating. The\ncounter-suggestion would be that technological thinking is merely the\npractical application of modern mathematical science, and that the\nlatter is therefore the primary phenomenon. Heidegger rejects this\nview, arguing in contrast that the establishment of the technological\nmode of revealing is a necessary condition for there to be mathematical\nscience at all, since such science \u201cdemands that nature be\norderable as standing-reserve\u201d by requiring that \u201cnature\nreport itself in some way or other that is identifiable through\ncalculation and that it remain orderable as a system of\ninformation\u201d (Question Concerning Technology 328).\nEither way, one might object to the view of science at work here, by\npointing to analyses which suggest that while science may\nreduce objects to instrumental means rather than ends, it need not\nbehave in this way. For example, O'Neill (2003) develops such an\nanalysis by drawing explicitly on (one interpretation of) the Marxist\n(and ultimately Aristotelian) notion of the humanization of the\nsenses. Good science may depend on the capacity for the\ndisinterested use of the senses, and so foster a non-instrumental\nresponsiveness to natural objects as ends rather than as means. This is\na \u2018humanization\u2019 because the disinterested use of the\nsenses is a characteristically human capacity. Thus to develop such a\ncapacity is to develop a distinctively human virtue, something which is\na constituent of human well-being. Moreover, if science may sometimes\noperate with a sense of awe and wonder in the face of beings, it may\npoint the way beyond the technological clearing, an effect that, as we\nshall see later, Heidegger thinks is achieved principally by some great\nart. \n\n\nBy revealing beings as no more than the measurable and the\nmanipulable, technology ultimately reduces beings to\nnot-beings (Contributions 2: 6). This is our first\nproper glimpse of the oblivion of Being, the phenomenon that, in the\nContributions, Heidegger also calls the abandonment of Being,\nor the abandonment of beings by Being (e.g., 55: 80). The notion of a\nnot-being signals two things: (i) technological revealing drives out\nany sense of awe and wonder in the presence of beings, obliterating the\nsecularized sense of what is sacred that is exemplified by the poetic\nhabitation of the natural environment of the Rhine; (ii) we are\nessentially indifferent to the loss. Heidegger calls this indifference\n\u201cthe hidden distress of no-distress-at-all\u201d\n(Contributions 4: 8). Indeed, on Heidegger's diagnosis,\nour response to the loss of any feeling of sacredness or awe in the\nface of beings is to find a technological substitute for that feeling,\nin the form of \u201clived-experience\u201d, a drive for\nentertainment and information, \u201cexaggeration and uproar\u201d\n(Contributions 66: 91). All that said, however, technology\nshould not be thought of as a wholly \u2018negative\u2019 phenomenon.\nFor Heidegger, technology is not only the great danger, it is also a\nstage in the unfolding of Being that brings us to the brink of a kind\nof secularized salvation, by awakening in us a (re-)discovery of the\nsacred, appropriately understood (cf. Thomson 2003, 64\u201366). A rough\nanalogy might be drawn here with the Marxist idea that the unfolding of\nhistory results in the establishment of capitalist means of production\nwith their characteristic \u2018negative\u2019 elements\u2014labour treated merely as a commodity, the multi-dimensional alienation\nof the workers\u2014that bring us to the brink of (by creating the\nimmediate social and economic preconditions for) the socialist\ntransformation of society. Indeed, the analogy might be pushed a little\nfurther: just as the socialist transformation of society remains\nanything but inevitable (Trotsky taught us that), Heidegger argues that\nthe salvation-bringing transformation of the present condition of human\nbeing is most certainly not bound to\noccur.\n\n\nTo bring all these points into better view, we need to take a step\nback and ask the following question. Is the technological mode of\nrevealing ultimately a human doing for which we are responsible?\nHeidegger's answer is \u2018yes and no\u2019. On the one hand,\nhumankind is the active agent of technological thinking, so humankind\nis not merely a passive element. On the other hand, \u201cthe\nunconcealment itself\u2026 is never a human handiwork\u201d\n(Question Concerning Technology 324). As Heidegger later put\nit, the \u201cessence of man is framed, claimed and challenged by a\npower which manifests itself in the essence of technology, a power\nwhich man himself does not control.\u201d (Only a God\ncan Save Us; 107, my emphasis). To explicate the latter\npoint, Heidegger introduces the concepts of destining (cf. the\nearlier notion of \u2018destiny\u2019) and enframing.\nDestining is \u201cwhat first starts man upon a way of\nrevealing\u201d (Question Concerning Technology 329). As such\nit is an a priori transcendental structure of human Being and so beyond\nour control. Human history is a temporally organized kaleidoscope of\nparticular ordainings of destining (see also On the Essence of\nTruth). Enframing is one such ordaining, the \u201cgathering\ntogether of the setting-upon that sets upon man, i.e., challenges him\nforth, to reveal the actual, in the mode of ordering, as\nstanding-reserve\u201d (Question Concerning Technology 325).\nThis is, of course, a way of unpacking the point (see above) that\ntechnology is \u201ca manner of the essential swaying of being\u201d\n(Contributions 61: 88), that is, of Being's own\nessential unfolding. \n\n\nEnframing, then, is the ordaining of destining that ushers in the\nmodern technological clearing. But there is more to it than that. To\nsee why, consider the following criticism of Heidegger's\nanalysis, as we have unpacked it so far. Any suggestion that\ntechnological thinking has appeared for the first time along with our\nmodern Western way of living would seem to be straightforwardly false.\nTo put the point crudely, surely the ancient Greeks sometimes treated\nentities merely as instrumental means. But if that is right, and\nHeidegger would agree that it is, then how can it be that technological\nthinking defines the spirit of our age? The answer lies in\nHeidegger's belief that pre-modern, traditional artisanship (as\nexemplified by the old wooden bridge over the Rhine), manifests what he\ncalls poiesis. In this context poiesis is to be understood as\na process of gathering together and fashioning natural materials in\nsuch a way that the human project in which they figure is in a deep\nharmony with, indeed reveals\u2014or as Heidegger sometimes\nsays when discussing poiesis, brings forth\u2014the essence\nof those materials and any natural environment in which they are set.\nThus, in discussing what needs to be learnt by an apprentice to a\ntraditional cabinetmaker, Heidegger writes:\n\n\nIf he is to become a true cabinetmaker, he makes himself answer and\nrespond above all to the different kinds of wood and to the shapes\nslumbering within wood\u2014to wood as it enters into man's\ndwelling with all the hidden riches of its essence. In fact, this\nrelatedness to wood is what maintains the whole craft. Without that\nrelatedness, the craft will never be anything but empty busywork, any\noccupation with it will be determined exclusively by business concerns.\nEvery handicraft, all human dealings, are constantly in that danger.\n(What is Called Thinking? 379)\n\n\nPoiesis, then, is a process of revealing. Poietic events are acts of\nunconcealment\u2014one is tempted to coin the ugly neologism\ntruth-ing\u2014in which entities are allowed to show\nthemselves. As with the closely related notion of original truth that\nis at work in Being and Time, the idea of entities showing\nthemselves does not imply that what is revealed in poiesis is something\nindependent of human involvement. Thus what is revealed by the\nartisanship of the cabinetmaker is \u201cwood as it enters into\nman's dwelling\u201d. This telling remark forges a crucial\nphilosophical link (and not merely an etymological one) between the\npoietic and poetic. Poietic events and poetic habitation involve the\nvery same mode of intelligibility.\n\n\nBy introducing the concept of poiesis, and by unearthing the\npresence of the phenomenon in traditional artisanship, Heidegger is\nsuggesting that even though technological thinking was a possibility in\npre-modern society, it was neither the only nor the dominant mode of\nbringing-forth. So what has changed? Heidegger argues that what is\ndistinctive about enframing as an ordaining of destining is (i) that it\n\u201cdrives out every other possibility of revealing\u201d\n(Question Concerning Technology 332), and (ii) that it covers\nup revealing as such (more precisely, covers up the\nconcealing-unconcealing character of appropriation), thereby leaving us\nblind to the fact that technology is, in its essence, a clearing. For\nHeidegger, these dual features of enframing are intimately tied up with\nthe idea of technology as metaphysics completing itself. He\nwrites: \u201c[a]s a form of truth [clearing] technology is grounded\nin the history of metaphysics, which is itself a distinctive and up to\nnow the only perceptible phase of the history of Being\u201d\n(Letter on Humanism 244). According to Heidegger, metaphysics\nconceives of Being as a being (for more on the reduction of Being to a\nbeing, see section 2.2.1 above). In so doing, metaphysics obscures the\nconcealing-unconcealing dynamic of the essential unfolding of Being, a\ndynamic that provides the a priori condition for there to be beings.\nThe history of metaphysics is thus equivalent to the history of Western\nphilosophy in which Being as such is passed over, a history that, for\nHeidegger, culminates in the nihilistic forces of Nietzsche's\neternally recurring will-to-power. The totalizing logic of metaphysics\ninvolves the view that there is a single clearing (whatever it may be)\nthat constitutes reality. This renders thought insensitive to the\nfundamental structure of Being, in which any particular clearing is\nontologically co-present with the unintelligible plenitude of\nalternative clearings, the mystery. With this totalizing logic in view,\nenframing might be thought of as the ordaining of destining that\nestablishes the technological clearing as the one dominant picture, to\nthe exclusion of all others. Hence technology is metaphysics completing\nitself.\n\n\nWe are now in a position to deal with two items of unfinished\nbusiness. First, recall the stylistic shift that characterizes\nHeidegger's later work. Heidegger not only increasingly engages\nwith poetry in his later thinking (especially the works of the German\nlyric poet H\u00f6lderlin), he also adopts a substantially more poetic\nstyle of writing. But why? The language of metaphysics, which\nultimately unpacks itself as technological, calculative thinking, is a\nlanguage from which Heidegger believed he did not fully escape in\nBeing and Time (see quotation from the Letter on\nHumanism at the beginning of section 3.1 above, and Vallega-Neu\n2003 24\u20139 for discussion). What is needed to think Being historically,\nto think Being in its essential unfolding, is a different kind of\nphilosophical language, a language suggested by the poetic character of\ndwelling. It is important to realize that Heidegger's intention\nhere is not to place Being beyond philosophy and within the reach of\npoetry, although he does believe that certain poets, such as\nH\u00f6lderlin, enable us to glimpse the mysterious aspect of Being.\nHis intention, rather, is to establish that the kind of philosophy that\nis needed here is itself poetic. This explains the stylistic component\nof the turn.\n\n\nSecondly, recall the loss of dwelling identified by Heidegger.\nModern humankind (at least in the West) is in the (enframed) grip of\ntechnological thinking. Because of this promotion of instrumentality as\nthe fundamental way of Being of entities, we have lost sight of how to\ninhabit the fourfold poetically, of how to safeguard the fourfold in\nits essential unfolding. Such safeguarding would, in a sense, be the\nopposite of technological thinking. But what \u2018opposite\u2019\namounts to here needs to be worked out with care. Given contemporary\nconcerns over deforestation, global warming and the like, it is\ntempting to think that Heidegger's analysis of technology might\nprovide the philosophical platform for some sort of extreme\neco-radicalism. However, while there is undoubtedly much of value to be\nsaid about the contribution that Heidegger's thinking may make to\ncontemporary debates in environmental ethics (see e.g., Zimmerman 1983,\n1993, 2002), Heidegger was no eco-warrior and no luddite. Although he\noften promoted a romantic image of a pre-technological age inhabited by\nworthy peasants in touch with nature, he did not believe that it is\npossible for modern humankind to forge some pastoral Eden from which\ntechnology (in both the everyday and the essential sense) is entirely\nabsent. So we should neither \u201cpush on blindly with\ntechnology\u201d nor \u201ccurse it as the work of the devil\u201d\n(Question Concerning Technology 330). Indeed, both these\noptions would at root be technological modes of thinking. The way\nforward, according to Heidegger, is not to end technology, but rather\nto inhabit it differently (see e.g., Vallega-Neu 2003 93 note 15). We\nneed to transform our mode of Being into one in which technology (in\nthe sense of the machines and devices of the modern age) is there for\nus to enjoy and use, but in which technology (in the sense of a mode of\nBeing-in-the-world) is not our only or fundamental way of encountering\nentities. And what is the basic character of this reinhabiting? It is\nto shelter the truth of Being in beings (e.g.,\nContributions 246: 273), to safeguard the fourfold in its\nessential unfolding. In what, then, does this safeguarding\nconsist?\n",
