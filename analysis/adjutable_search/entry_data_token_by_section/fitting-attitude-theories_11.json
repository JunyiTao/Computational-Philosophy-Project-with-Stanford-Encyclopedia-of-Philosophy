    "main_text": "Outstanding Issues || The Wrong Kind of Value Problem\n3.2 The Wrong Kind of Value Problem\n\nThe Wrong Kind of Value problem (WKV problem) also poses\ncounterexamples to at least certain FA theories. It alleges that there\ncan be cases in which something has value without calling for any\nvaluing response on the part of anyone\u2014i.e., the thing\nisn\u2019t fitting for anyone to value, there\u2019s no reason for\nanyone to value it, it\u2019s not the case that anyone ought to value\nit, etc. In short: there are cases where facts about value\ncan\u2019t correspond to normative facts to the effect that\nsome valuing response is called for, since in some cases the former\nsort of fact can obtain without the latter.\n\nTo illustrate, consider an example, the spirit of which is due to\nKrister Bykvist (2009), in which there are happy egrets, but no past,\npresent, or future agents, i.e., beings capable of having a valuing\nresponse. Plausibly, the egrets\u2019 pleasure has value. But, the\nthought goes, since there are no beings in this world capable of\nvaluing the egrets\u2019 pleasure, the egrets\u2019 pleasure\ncan\u2019t be valued and hence a valuing response to it can\u2019t\nbe fitting or otherwise called for. Thus, the value of the\negrets\u2019 happiness doesn\u2019t correspond to a normative fact\nabout a valuing response. Hence, FA theories must be extensionally\ninadequate.\n\nAnother kind of example is due to Andrew Reisner (2015). In this kind\nof example, the value of something in a given world depends on whether\nanyone in that world values that thing. If anyone in the relevant\nworld does value the thing, then the thing becomes disvaluable, or\nbad. However, if no one values it, then it\u2019s valuable. (There\nare various ways of filling out this kind of case, but these are its\nimportant structural features; for Reisner\u2019s preferred version,\nsee ibid., 467\u20138.) In this kind of case, valuing something\nvaluable extinguishes its value. Reisner claims that it therefore\ncan\u2019t be fitting to value the valuable thing; hence, FA theories\nare extensionally inadequate.\n\nDefenders of FA theory have responded to these cases in various ways\n(Orsi 2013a; Way 2013; Elliott 2017; Rowland 2019). Perhaps the most\npopular response to each is one that purports to answer both. This\nresponse agrees that it\u2019s not fitting (or otherwise called for)\nfor anyone in the happy egret world to value the egrets\u2019\npleasure (since there are no beings capable of valuing in this world)\nand that it\u2019s not fitting for anyone in the world Reisner\ndescribes to value the thing whose value would be extinguished if\nanyone in that world were to value it. But, the response goes,\nit\u2019s nonetheless fitting for beings in other possible\nworlds\u2014us, for example\u2014to value the egrets\u2019 pleasure\n(so far as it goes) and to value the valuable thing whose value would\nbe eliminated were to it be valued by its worldmates (Orsi 2013a; Way\n2013; Rowland 2019). Hence, in both kinds of case, the value at stake\ncan still be said to correspond to normative facts about a certain\nvaluing response, albeit a response to be had by beings of other\nworlds.\n\nReisner (2015) anticipates and criticizes the above response on\nvarious grounds, though see Rowland (2019, ch. 7) for an extended\nreply. A different response, also offered by Rowland, suggests that FA\ntheorists might state their theory counterfactually, claiming\n(roughly) that whenever something has value, that\u2019s fully\nbecause valuing it would be called for were there any beings\ncapable of valuing it around. On this formulation of FA theory,\nsomething has value if, in the nearest world where there are beings\ncapable of valuing it, their valuing it is called for. Since a valuing\nresponse to the egrets\u2019 pleasure is evidently called for in the\nnearest world where there are beings capable of valuing it, this\nformulation of the theory thus predicts that the birds\u2019 pleasure\nhas value. Thus, this formulation of FA theory seems at least to avoid\nBykvist\u2019s kind of counterexample. However, it doesn\u2019t also\nobviously avoid Reisner\u2019s. In Reisner\u2019s case, unlike\nBykvist\u2019s, the nearest world where there are beings capable of\nvaluing the valuable thing in question is the same world that contains\nthe valuable thing. But recall: if beings in that world were to value\nthe valuable thing, the thing wouldn\u2019t be valuable. And\naccording to Reisner, this means that it can\u2019t be fitting or\notherwise called for, for those beings to value the thing in question.\nReisner here relies on a principle according to which it can be\nfitting for an agent S to value a thing x only if\nx would be fitting to value, conditional on\nS\u2019s valuing it. If this principle is true, then the\ncounterfactual proposal fails to address Reisner\u2019s case; but see\nRowland (ibid.) for arguments that it\u2019s false.\n\nWhich of these responses to the WKV problem is preferable, and whether\neither is ultimately acceptable, remain open questions, and so\nconstitute avenues for further research. Two final points are worth\nemphasis. First, the force of the WKV problem, unlike that of the WKR\nproblem, seems to depend not at all on which normative property of\nresponses that FA theories appeal to in their explanations of\nevaluative facts. In particular, the problem seems to apply with equal\nforce to FA theories that appeal to the fittingness of human\nresponses and to those that appeal to reasons for those\n responses.[8]\n Hence, the WKV problem may apply more widely than the WKR problem.\nBut, secondly, the WKV problem seems in another way narrower than the\nWKR problem. For while the WKR problem applies not only to FA theories\nof value simpliciter, but also to FA theories of specific\nevaluative properties, such as those of being shameful or disgusting,\nthe WKV problem may not generalize in this way. For notice that the\nWKV problem illustrates and supports the worry, mentioned in section\n1.1, that facts about value simpliciter can seem independent\nof (normative) facts about actual or possible human responses. But\nfacts about what\u2019s shameful or disgusting\nseemingly couldn\u2019t be independent of (normative) facts about the\nhuman responses of shame or disgust (D\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2006;\nJacobson 2011; D\u2019Arms 2022). Perhaps something could be valuable\nin a world without valuers, but could something be shameful in a world\nwithout shame? If not, then the WKV problem may be a problem for some,\nbut not all, FA theories, depending on the evaluative properties the\ntheories target. At best, then, the WKV problem wouldn\u2019t be a\nreason to reject FA theory tout court, but only to be more\nselective about which FA theories we accept.\n",
