    "main_text": "The Various Roles of Sophismata\n4. Sophismata Literature\n\nIn the Introduction of the Catalogue (Ebbesen and Goubier\n2010, vol. I), we find an elaborate description of the medieval genre\nof sophismata. This genre was based on disputational\npractices in medieval universities. In its most basic form, it\nincluded the discussion of a problematic proposition, beginning with\nthe presentation of the proposition, followed by a proof, a disproof,\nand a solution, sometimes accompanied by a response to the opposing\narguments (see our section 2.2). The joint discsussion of these steps\nwas known as corpus sophismatis. A respondent\u2019s\nsolution to the sophisma could be followed by an attack,\nleading to yet another exchange of arguments. In other instances the\ndiscussion of the sophisma could continue with a discussion\nof related problems, the first of which was often dealt with in an\nelaborate way. These kinds of sophismata are quite long.\n\nSophismata are found in a variety of texts, which scholars\nhave categorized into different kinds. Abstractiones\ntreatises are collections of sophismata arranged by a type of\nsyncategorematic word (e.g., exceptive words, exclusive words,\nconditional words, disjunctive words, and so on), or sometimes by the\ndistinction that is used to solve them. The material covered in each\nsophisma is mostly confined to a corpus.\nSyncategoremata are treatises devoted to syncategorematic\nwords; in these treatises sophismata are used to illustrate\nor to give more refined explanations of the logical behaviour of the\ndifferent syncategorematic words (or kinds of syncategorematic words).\nIn Distinctiones treatises, the starting points are\ndistinctions or logical rules connected with sentences that contain a\nsyncategorematic word. The material in these treatises is usually\norganized around the type of syncategorematic word at issue. Besides\nthese different kinds of treatises (the boundaries of which, however,\nare not very clear), we also find collections of sophismata\nthat seem to be (fictional or faithful) reports of oral disputations.\nThese collections can contain grammatical sophismata, but the\nlatter are also found in separate, rather loosely-organized,\ntreatises. Sophismata also play an important role in general\nmanuals of logic, and in other works \u2014 often written by the same\nauthors, or by different authors working in the same milieu as the\nformer collections \u2014 with titles such as On Exponibles,\nOn Consequences, Sophistry, etc.\n\nEven if there are technical distinctions among these types of\ntreatises, all of them play the same roles mentioned above: they\nprovide students with logical skills that can be applied to any\nsubject whatsoever.\n",
