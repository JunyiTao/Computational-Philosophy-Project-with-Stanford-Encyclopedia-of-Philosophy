    "main_text": "The Laws of Thought\n2. The Laws of Thought\n\n Like many representatives of 19th-century logic and\nphilosophy of science, Jevons starts his investigation by examining the\nnature of the Laws of Thought. Jevons argues that these Laws are\ntrue both \u201cin the nature of thought and things\u201d. \nGiven that science is in the mind and not in the things, the Laws of\nThought seem to be purely subjective and only verified in the\nobservation of the external world. However, Jevons argues that it\nis impossible to prove the fundamental laws of logic by reasoning,\nsince they are already presupposed by the notion of a proof. \nHence, the Laws of Thought must be presupposed by science as \u201cthe\nprior conditions of all thought and all knowledge\u201d. \nFurthermore, our thoughts cannot be used as a criterion of truth, since\nwe all know that mistakes are possible and omnipresent. Hence, we\nneed to presuppose objective Laws of Thought in order to discriminate\nbetween correct and incorrect reasoning. It follows that Jevons\nregards the Laws of Thought as objective laws.\n\n The fundamental mental powers for knowledge acquisition are the power\nto discriminate, to detect identity and to retain. The\nfundamental laws of thought are threefold: the Law of Identity, the Law\nof Contradiction and the Law of Duality. The first law is\ndescribed as \u201cWhatever is, is\u201d and implies that a thing is\nalways identical with itself. Jevons does not define the concept\nof \u201cidentity\u201d, and tends to regard it as\nself-evident. The second law is the classical law of\ncontradiction: \u201cA thing cannot both be and not be\u201d. \nThe third law is the law of the excluded middle: \u201cA thing must\neither be or not be.\u201d  Jevons suggests that these three laws\nare merely different aspects of one and the same Law, but considers it\nimpossible to express this Law in less than three lines. His\nsymbolic representation of these laws is as follows:\n\n\n\n(1)\nA = A\nLaw of Identity\n\n\n(2)\nAa = 0\nLaw of Contradiction\n\n\n(3)\nA = AB \u00b7|\u00b7 Ab\nLaw of Duality\n\n\n\n\n The absence of a clear definition of \u2018identity\u2019 is\nstriking, especially since Jevons recognises that there are different\nkinds and degrees of sameness. The main problem is then to point\nout a \u201csufficient degree of likeness or sameness\u201d. \nThe simplest form of inference is making use of a pattern, proxy,\nexample or sample. If the sample \u201cexactly represents the\ntexture, appearance, and general nature\u201d of a certain commodity,\nthen what is true for the sample will also be true for the commodity as\na whole. This approach evades defining similarity, as it\npresupposes that the sample is an \u2018exact representation\u2019 of\nthe commodity whereas it is unclear under what conditions that would be\nthe case. All processes of inference are based on the principle\nof substitution. All knowledge is derived from sensual\nexperience, which implies that all knowledge is inductive. \nDeduction is the inverse process of induction, and both rely upon the\nnature of identity. \n",
