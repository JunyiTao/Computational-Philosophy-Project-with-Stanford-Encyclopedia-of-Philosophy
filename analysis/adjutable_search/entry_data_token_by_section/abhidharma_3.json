The dharma taxonomy: a metaphysics of experience\n\nThe Abhidharma attempts to individuate and determine the unique\nidentity of each dharma yield complex intersecting taxonomies\nof dharmas organized by multiple criteria or sets of\nqualities. Abhidharma texts of different schools proposed different\ndharma taxonomies, enumerating a more or less finite number\nof dharma categories. It is important to remember, though,\nthat the term dharma signifies both any category that\nrepresents a type of occurrence as well as any of its particular\ntokens or instances. The Therav\u0101da introduced a system of\neighty-two dhamma categories, meaning that there are\neighty-two possible types of occurrence in the experiential world, not\neighty-two occurrences. These are organized into a fourfold\ncategorization. The first three categories include the bare phenomenon\nof consciousness (citta) that encompasses a single\ndhamma type and of which the essential characteristic is the\ncognizing of an object; associated mentality (cetasika) that\nencompasses fifty-two dhammas; and materiality or physical\nphenomena (r\u016bpa) that include twenty-eight\ndhammas that make up all physical occurrences\n(Abhidh-av 1). All the eighty-one dhamma types in\nthese three broad categories are conditioned\n(sa\u1e45khata). Conditioned dhammas arise and\ncease subject to numerous causes and conditions and constitute\nsentient experience in all realms of the round of rebirth\n (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra).[8]\n The eighty-second dhamma that comprises the fourth category\nis unconditioned (asa\u1e45khata): it neither arises nor\nceases through causal interaction. The single occurrence in this\nfourth category is nirvana (Pali, nibb\u0101na).\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da adopted a system of seventy-five basic\ntypes of dharmas organized into a fivefold categorization.\nThe first four categories comprise all conditioned\n(sa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta) dharmas and include, again,\nconsciousness (citta, one single dharma); associated\nmentality (caitta, encompasses forty-six dharmas);\nand physical phenomena (r\u016bpa, eleven dharmas);\nbut also factors dissociated from thought\n(cittaviprayuktasa\u1e43sk\u0101ra, fourteen\ndharmas). The last category is mentioned neither in the\ns\u016btras nor in the Therav\u0101da lists, but is found\npredominantly in northern Indian Abhidharma texts of all periods. The\nspecific dharmas included within it vary, but they are all\nunderstood as explaining a range of experiential events, being\nthemselves dissociated from both material form and thought. The fifth\ncategory in the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da taxonomy, that of the\nunconditioned (asa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta), comprises three\ndharmas, namely, space and two states of cessation\n(nirodha), the latter being a term that connotes the\nculmination of the Buddhist path (Cox 1995; 2004A, 553\u2013554).\n\nThe Abhidharma analyzes in great detail each of these categories, thus\ncreating relational schemata whereby each acknowledged experience,\nphenomenon, or occurrence can be determined and identified by\nparticular definition and function. Especially important is the\nanalysis of consciousness or citta, on which much of\nAbhidharma doctrinal thought is built. Consider the Therav\u0101da\nanalysis of consciousness, whose basic principles are shared with the\nother Abhidharma systems.\n\nThe epitome of the operation of consciousness is citta as\nexperienced in the process of sensory perception that, in Abhidharma\n(as in Buddhism in general), is deemed the paradigm of sentient\nexperience. Citta can never be experienced as bare\nconsciousness in its own origination moment, for consciousness is\nalways intentional, directed to a particular object that is cognized\nby means of certain mental factors. Citta, therefore, always\noccurs associated with its appropriate cetasikas or mental\nfactors that perform diverse functions and that emerge and cease\ntogether with it, having the same object (either sensuous or mental)\nand grounded in the same sense faculty. Any given consciousness\nmoment\u2014also signified by the very term citta\u2014is\nthus a unique assemblage of citta and its associated mental\nfactors such as feeling, conceptualization, volition, or attention, to\nname several of those required in any thought process. Each assemblage\nis conscious of just one object, arises for a brief instant and then\nfalls away, followed by another citta combination that picks\nup a different object by means of its particular associated mental\nfactors.\n\nThe classic Abhidhamma scheme as gleaned from the first book of the\nAbhidhamma-pi\u1e6daka, the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i, and as organized by the\ncommentarial tradition describes eighty-nine basic types of\nconsciousness moments, i.e., assemblages of citta and\ncetasika (Dhs Book I; Vism XIV\n81\u2013110; Abhidh-av 1\u201315; Abhidh-s\n1\u20135). It classifies these basic citta types most\nbroadly according to their locus of occurrence, beginning with the\nsense-sphere (k\u0101m\u0101vacara) that includes forty-five\ncitta types, most prominently those that concern the\nmechanics of perception of sensuous objects; next come eighteen\nform-sphere (r\u016bp\u0101vacara) consciousnesses that\nconcern the mind that has attained meditative absorption\n(jh\u0101na); followed by eight formless-sphere\n(ar\u016bp\u0101vacara) consciousnesses that constitute the\nmind that has reached further meditative attainments known as formless\nstates; finally, there are eighteen world-transcending\n(lokuttara) consciousnesses that constitute the mind at the\nmoment of awakening itself: these have nirvana as their object. Within\nthese four broad categories many other classifications operate. For\ninstance, some dhammas are wholesome, others unwholesome;\nsome are resultant, others are not; some are motivated, others are\nwithout motivations. These attribute matrices, writes Cox (2004A,\n552), form \u201can abstract web of all possible conditions and\ncharacteristics exhibited by actually occurring dharmas. The\nindividual character of any particular dharma can then be\nspecified in accordance with every taxonomic possibility, resulting in\na complete assessment of that dharma\u2019s range of\npossible occurrences.\u201d\n\nVarious scholars have argued that this system reflects a dynamic\nconception of dharmas: that Abhidharma understands\ndharmas as properties, activities, or patterns of\ninterconnection that construct one\u2019s world, not as static\nsubstances (e.g., Cox 2004A, 549ff; Gethin 1992A, 149\u2013150;\nKarunadasa 2010, Ch. 4; Nyanaponika 1998, Ch. 2 & 4; Ronkin 2005,\nCh. 4; Waldron 2002, 2\u201316). The Abhidharma lists of dharmas are\n\u201cexplicitly open\u201d and reflect \u201ca certain reluctance\nand hesitancy to say categorically that such and such is the\ndefinitive list of dharmas\u201d (Gethin 2017, 252), leaving room for\ncontinued debates about what is and is not a dharma. For the\nAbhidharma, as for Buddhism in general, the limits of one\u2019s\nworld are set by the limits of one\u2019s lived experience, and the\ncausal foundation for lived experience is the operation of one\u2019s\ncognitive apparatus. According to the Buddhist path, the nature of\nlived experience as based on one\u2019s cognitive apparatus is to be\ncontemplated by investigating the very nature of one\u2019s mind\nthrough the practice of meditation. From this perspective, Abhidharma\nrepresents the theoretical counterpart to the practice of meditation.\nWithin this context of Buddhist practice, dharmas are\ndistinct (but interrelated) functions, energies, or causally\nsignificant aspects\u2014in this sense\n\u201ccomponents\u201d\u2014of consciousness moments.\n\nThe categorial analysis of dharmas is therefore a meditative\npractice of discernment of dharmas: it is not intended as a\nclosed inventory of all existing dharmas \u201cout\nthere\u201d in their totality, but rather \u201chas a dual\nsoteriological purpose involving two simultaneous processes\u201d\n(Cox 2004A, 551). First, as \u201cevaluative\u201d analysis, the\ndharma typology maps out the constituents and workings of the\nmind and accounts for what makes up ordinary wholesome consciousness\nas opposed to the awakened mind. For instance, consciousness types\nthat arise in a mind that has attained meditative absorption become\nincreasingly refined and may never involve certain tendencies or\ndefilements that might potentially occur in ordinary (even wholesome)\nconsciousness. To watch dharmas as dharmas, writes\nGethin (2004, 536), \u201cinvolves watching how they arise and\ndisappear, how the particular qualities that one wants to abandon can\nbe abandoned, and how the particular qualities that one wants to\ndevelop can be developed. Watching dhammas in this way one\nbegins to understand [\u2026] certain truths\n(sacca)\u2014four to be exact\u2014about these\ndhammas: their relation to suffering, its arising, its\nceasing and the way to its ceasing. And in seeing these four truths\none realizes the ultimate truth\u2014dhamma\u2014about the\n world.\u201d[9]\n\nThe second, \u201cdescriptive\u201d soteriological process involved\nin the categorization of dharmas reveals the fluid nature of\nsentient experience and validates the fundamental Buddhist teaching of\nnot-self (Skt., an\u0101tman, Pali, anatta). The\nincreasingly detailed enumerations of dharmas demonstrate\nthat no essence or independent self could be found in any phenomenon\nor its constituents, since all aspects of experience are impermanent,\narising and passing away subject to numerous causes and conditions.\nEven the handful dharmas that are categorized as\nunconditioned (that is, having no cause and no effect) are shown to be\nnot-self. The practice of the discrimination of dharmas thus\nundermines the apparently solid world we emotionally and\nintellectually grasp at that is replete with objects of desire and\nattachment. \u201cTry to grasp the world of the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i, or the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na,\u201d Gethin notes (1992B, 165),\n\u201cand it runs through one\u2019s fingers.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the very notion of the plurality of dharmas as\nthe building blocks or the final units of analysis of sentient\nexperience signifies a considerable shift in the Buddhist\nunderstanding of dharma. Abhidharma thought was gradually\ndrawn into espousing a naturalistic explanation of dharmas as\nthe fundamental constituents of the phenomenal world, increasingly\nassociating dharmas as primary existents. The category of the\nunconditioned within the dharma taxonomy also asserted the\npossibility of enduring or permanent dharmas, in contrast to\nall other dharmas that arise and cease through causal\ninteraction. The Abhidharma exegesis, then, occasioned among Buddhist\ncircles doctrinal controversies that could be termed ontological\naround such issues as what the nature of a dharma is; what,\nin the internal constitution of a dharma, makes it the very\nparticular it is; the manner of existence of dharmas; the\ndynamics of their causal interaction; and the nature of the reality\nthey constitute. The distinctive principles and their ensuing\nontological interpretations constructed by the Buddhist schools were\nlargely shaped by a radical construal of impermanence as\nmomentariness.\n",
