Nevertheless,\nit is plausible that corruption in general, including institutional\ncorruption frequently, if not typically, involves the despoiling of\nthe moral character of persons and in particular, in the case of\ninstitutional corruption, the despoiling of the moral character of\ninstitutional role occupants qua institutional role\noccupants. To this extent institutional corruption involves personal\ncorruption and, thereby, connects institutional corruption to moral\ncharacter. If the moral character of particular institutional role\noccupants, (e.g., police detectives), consists in large part of their\npossession of certain virtues definitive of the role in question\n(e.g., honesty, independence of mind, impartiality) then institutional\ncorruption will frequently involve the displacement of those virtues\nin these role occupants by corresponding vices, (e.g., dishonesty,\nweak mindedness, bias); that is, institutional corruption will\nfrequently involve institutional personal corruption.\n\nAs noted above, the relationship between institutional corruption and\npersonal corruption is something that has been emphasized\nhistorically, e.g., by Plato, Aristotle and Machiavelli. However, some\nrecent theorists of structural corruption have tended to downplay this\nrelationship. Lessig\u2019s notion of dependence corruption (Lessig\n2011), in particular, evidently decouples structural corruption from\n(institutional) personal corruption (see\n section 2.3.3\n below).\n\nPersonal corruption, i.e., the state of having been\ncorrupted, is not the same thing as performing a corrupt\naction, i.e., being a corruptor. Typically, corruptors are\nthemselves corrupted, but this is not necessarily the case. Consider,\nfor example, a parent who pays a one-off bribe to an immigration\nofficial in order to be reunited with her child. The parent is a\ncorruptor by virtue of performing a corrupt action, but she is not\nnecessarily corrupted by her, let us assume, morally justifiable\naction.\n\nDoes personal corruption imply moral responsibility for one\u2019s\ncorrupt character? This issue is important in its own right but it\nalso has implications for our understanding of structural corruption.\nCertainly, many, if not most, of those who are corrupted are morally\nresponsible for being so. After all, they do or should know what it is\nto be corrupt and they could have avoided becoming corrupt. Consider,\nfor instance, kleptocrats, such as Mobuto and Marcos, who have looted\nbillions of dollars from the public purse (Sharman 2017), or senior\nmembers of multi-national corporations who have been engaged in\nongoing massive bribery in China and elsewhere (Pei 2016). These\nkleptocrats and corporate leaders are not only corruptors, they are\nthemselves corrupt; moreover, they are morally responsible for being\nin their state of corruption.\n\nHowever, there appear to be exceptions to the claim that personal\ncorruption necessarily or always brings with it moral responsibility\nfor one\u2019s corrupt character, e.g., adolescents who have been\nraised in criminal families and, as a result, participate in the\ncorrupt enterprises of these families. These individuals perform\nactions which are an expression of their corrupt characters and which\nalso have a corrupting effect.\n\nWhat of the moral responsibility of corruptors for their corrupt\nactions? It is plausible that many, if not most, corruptors are\nmorally responsible for their corrupt actions (e.g., the legions of\nthose rightly convicted of corruption in criminal courts\u2014and\ntherefore, presumably, morally responsible for their actions\u2014in\njurisdictions around the world), but there appear to be exceptions,\ne.g., those who are coerced into offering bribes.\n\nOne school of thought in the theory of social institutions that might\nwell reject the view that corruptors are necessarily or even typically\nmorally responsible (or, therefore, blameworthy) for their corrupt\nactions is structuralism (L\u00e9vi-Strauss 1962 [1966]) and\nespecially structural Marxism (Althusser 1971). According to the\nlatter view institutional structure and, in particular, economic\nclass-based relations largely determine institutional structures and\ncultures, and regularities in the actions of institutional actors. On\nthis anti-individualist conception neither institutional corrosion nor\ninstitutional corruption\u2014supposing the two notions can be\ndistinguished (see below)\u2014are ultimately to be understood by\nrecourse to the actions of morally responsible individual human\nagents. Strong forms of structuralism are inconsistent with most\ncontemporary philosophical accounts of institutional corruption, not\nthe least because these accounts typically assume that institutions\nhave an inherently normative\u2014rather than merely\nideological\u2014dimension. However there are echoes of weaker forms\nof structuralism in some of these accounts when it comes to the issue\nof the moral responsibility of human persons for institutional\ncorruption. One influential contemporary theorist of corruption who\napparently does not accept the view that corruptors are necessarily or\nalways morally responsible (or, therefore, blameworthy) for their\ncorrupt actions is Lessig (Lessig 2011) (see\n section 2.3.3\n below).\n\nThe upshot of our discussion of (institutional) personal corruption\nand moral responsibility is as follows. We now have, at least\nnotionally, a fourfold distinction in relation to corruptors: (1)\ncorruptors who are morally responsible for their corrupt action and\nblameworthy; (2) corruptors who are morally responsible for their\ncorrupt action but not blameworthy; (3) corruptors who are not morally\nresponsible for having a corrupt character, but whose actions: (a) are\nexpressive of their corrupt character, and; (b) have a corrupting\neffect; (4) corruptors who do not have a corrupt character and are\nneither morally responsible nor blameworthy for their corrupt actions,\nyet whose actions have a corrupting effect, e.g., by virtue of some\nform of structural dependency for which individual human persons are\nnot morally responsible.\n2.1.2 Institutional Corrosion and Structural Corruption\n\nNaturally, in the case of institutional corruption typically greater\ninstitutional damage is being done than simply the despoiling of the\nmoral character of the institutional role occupants. Specifically,\ninstitutional processes are being undermined, and/or institutional\npurposes subverted. A further point is that the undermining of\ninstitutional purposes or processes typically requires the actions of\nmultiple agents; the single action of a single agent is typically not\nsufficient. The multiple actions of the multiple agents in question\ncould be a joint action(s) or they could be individual actions taken\nin aggregate. A joint action is one in which two or more agents\nperform a contributory individual action in the service of a common or\ncollective end (Miller 2010: Chapter 1) or, according to some\ntheorists, joint intention (Bratman 2016: Chapter 1). For instance,\nmotivated by financial gain, a group of traders within the banking\nsector might cooperate with one another in order to manipulate a\nfinancial benchmark rate, such as LIBOR (London Interbank Borrowing\nRate) (Wheatley 2012).\n\nHowever, arguably, the undermining of institutional processes and/or\npurposes is not a sufficient condition for institutional corruption.\nActs of institutional damage that are not performed by a corruptor and\nalso do not corrupt persons might be thought to be better\ncharacterized as acts of institutional corrosion. Consider,\nfor example, funding decisions that gradually reduce public monies\nallocated to the court system in some large jurisdiction. As a\nconsequence, magistrates might be progressively less well trained and\nthere might be fewer and fewer of them to deal with the gradually\nincreasing workload of cases. This may well lead to a diminution over\ndecades in the quality of the adjudications of these magistrates, and\nso the judicial processes are to an extent undermined. However, given\nthe size of the jurisdiction and the incremental nature of these\nchanges, neither the magistrates, nor anyone else, might be aware of\nthis process of judicial corrosion, or even able to become aware of it\n(given heavy workloads, absence of statistical information, etc.). At\nany rate, if we assume that neither the judges nor anyone else can do\nanything to address the problem then, while there has clearly been\njudicial corrosion, arguably there has not been judicial corruption.\nWhy is such corrosion not also corruption?\n\nFor institutional corrosion to constitute corruption, it might be\nclaimed (Miller 2017: Chapter 3), the institutional damage done needs\nto be avoidable; indeed, it might also be claimed that the relevant\nagents must be capable of being held morally responsible for the\ndamage, at least in the generality of cases. So if the magistrates in\nour example were to become aware of the diminution in the quality of\ntheir adjudications, could cause additional resources to be provided\nand yet chose to do nothing, then arguably the process of corrosion\nmight have become a process of corruption.\n\nAn important question that arises here is whether or not institutional\ncorruption is relative to a teleological or purpose-driven conception\nof institutions and, relatedly, whether the purposes in question are\nto be understood normatively. Arguably, the institutional purposes of\nuniversities include the acquisition of new knowledge and its\ntransmission to students; moreover, arguably, knowledge acquisition is\na human good since it enables (indirectly), for instance, health needs\nto be met. However, it has been suggested that the purposes of\npolitical institutions, in particular, are too vague or contested to\nbe definitive of them (Ceva & Ferretti 2017; Warren 2004). One\nresponse to this is to claim that governments are in large part\nmeta-institutions with the responsibility to ensure that\nsociety\u2019s other institutions realize their distinctive\ninstitutional purposes. On this view, an important purpose of\ngovernments is provided, in effect, by the purposes of other\nfundamental institutions. For instance, an important purpose of\ngovernments might be to ensure market-based institutions operate in a\nfree, fair, efficient and effective manner (Miller 2017: 14.1).\n2.1.3 Institutional Actors and Corruption\n\nNaturally, there are many different kinds of entities which might\ncausally undermine institutions, including other collective entities.\nHowever, collectivist accounts of institutions go beyond the\nascription of causal responsibility and, in some cases, ascribe moral\nresponsibility. Firstly, such collectivist accounts of institutions\nascribe intentions, beliefs and so on to organizations and other\ncollective entities per se. Secondly, this ascription of mindedness to\ncollective entities leaves the way open to ascribe moral agency to\nthese entities (French 1979; List & Pettit 2011). On such\ncollectivist accounts corruptors include collective entities; indeed,\ncorruptors who are morally responsible for their corrupt actions. Thus\nLockheed Corporation, on this view, was a moral agent (or, at least,\nan immoral agent) which corrupted the Japanese government (a second\nmoral agent) by way of bribery. Other theorists, typically referred to\nas individualists, reject minded collective entities (Ludwig 2017;\nMiller 2010). Accordingly to individualists, only human agents are\npossessed of minds and moral\n agency.[4]\n Thus collective entities, such as organizations, do not have\nminds and are not per se moral agents. Accordingly, it is only human\nagents who culpably perform actions that undermine legitimate\ninstitutional processes or purposes.\n\nAn important related issue that arises at this point pertains to the\nhuman agents who perform acts of corruption. Are they necessarily\ninstitutional actors? It might be thought that this was not the case.\nSupposing a criminal bribes a public official in order to get a permit\nto own a gun. The criminal is not an institutional actor and yet he\nhas performed an act of institutional corruption. However, in this\nexample the public official has accepted the bribe and she is an\ninstitutional actor. So the example does not show that institutional\ncorruption does not necessarily involve the participation of an\ninstitutional actor. What if the criminal offered the bribe but it was\nnot accepted? While this may well be a crime and is certainly an\nattempt at institutional corruption, arguably, it is not an actual\ninstance of an act of institutional corruption but rather a failed\nattempt. Moreover, it is presumably not an instance of institutional\ncorruption because the institutional actor approached refused to\nparticipate in the attempted corrupt action. Let us pursue this issue\nfurther.\n\nAs we saw in\n section 1,\n corruption, even if it involves the abuse of public office, is not\nnecessarily pursued for private gain. However, according to many\ndefinitions of corruption institutional corruption necessarily\ninvolves abuse of public office. Moreover, our example of an attempted\nbribe to secure a gun permit involves a public official. However, we\nhave canvassed arguments in section 1 that contra this view acts of\ncorruption might be actions performed by persons who do not hold\npublic office, e.g., price-fixing by market actors, a witness who\ngives false testimony in a law court. At this point in the argument we\nneed to invoke a distinction between persons who hold a public office\nand persons who have an institutional role. CEOs of corporations do\nnot hold public office but they do have an institutional role. Hence a\nCEO who embezzles his company\u2019s money is engaged in corruption.\nAgain, citizens are not necessarily holders of public offices, but\nthey do have an institutional role qua citizens, e.g., as\nvoters. Hence a voter who breaks into the electoral office and stuffs\nthe ballot boxes with falsified voting papers in order to ensure the\nelection of her favored candidate is engaged in corruption,\nnotwithstanding the fact that she does not hold public office.\n2.2 Causal Theory of Institutional Corruption\n\nThe causal theory of institutional corruption (Miller 2017)\npresupposes a normative teleological conception of institutions\naccording to which institutions are defined not only as organizations\nor systems of organizations with a purpose(s), but organizations or\nsystems of organizations the purpose(s) of which is a human good. The\ngoods in question are either intrinsic or instrumental goods. For\ninstance, universities are held to have as their purpose the discovery\nand transmission of knowledge, where knowledge is at the very least an\ninstrumental good. (For criticisms see Thompson 2018 and Ceva &\nFerretti 2021.)\n\nIf a serviceable definition of the concept of a corrupt action is to\nbe found\u2014and specifically, one that does not collapse into the\nmore general notion of an immoral action\u2014then attention needs to\nbe focused on the moral effects that some actions have on\npersons and institutions. An action is corrupt only if it corrupts\nsomething or someone\u2014so corruption is not only a moral concept,\nbut also a causal or quasi-causal concept. That is, an action\nis corrupt by virtue of having a corrupting effect on a\nperson\u2019s moral character or on an institutional process or\npurpose. If an action has a corrupting effect on an institution,\nundermining institutional processes or purposes, then\ntypically\u2014but not necessarily\u2014it has a corrupting effect\nalso on persons qua role occupants in the affected\ninstitutions.\n\nAccordingly, an action is corrupt only if it has the effect of\nundermining an institutional process or of subverting an institutional\npurpose or of despoiling the character of some role occupant\nqua role occupant. In light of the possibility that some acts\nof corruption have negligible effects, such as a small one-off bribe\npaid for a minor service, this defining feature needs to be qualified\nso as to include acts that are of a type or kind that tends to\nundermine institutional processes, purposes or persons (qua\ninstitutional role occupants)\u2014as well as individual or token\nacts that actually have the untoward effects in question. Thus\nqualified, the causal character of corruption provides the\nsecond main feature of the causal theory of institutional corruption,\nthe first feature being the normative teleological conception of\ninstitutions. I note accounts predicated on these two assumptions have\nancient origins, notably in Aristotle (Hindess 2001).\n\nIn keeping with the causal account, an infringement of a specific law\nor institutional rule does not in and of itself constitute an act of\ninstitutional corruption. In order to do so, any such infringement\nneeds to have an institutionally undermining effect, or be of\na kind that has a tendency to cause such an effect, e.g., to defeat\nthe institutional purpose of the rule, to subvert the institutional\nprocess governed by the rule, or to contribute to the despoiling of\nthe moral character of a role occupant qua role occupant. In\nshort, we need to distinguish between the offence considered in itself\nand the institutional effect of committing that offence. Considered in\nitself the offence of, say, lying is an infringement of a law, rule,\nand/or a moral principle. However, the offence is only an act of\ninstitutional corruption if it has some institutionally undermining\neffect, or is of a kind that has such a tendency, e.g., it is\nperformed in a courtroom setting and thereby subverts the judicial\nprocess.\n\nA third feature of the causal theory of institutional corruption\npertains to the agents who cause the corruption. As noted in\n section 2.1.3,\n there are many different kinds of entities which might causally\nundermine institutions, including other collective entities. However,\nit is an assumption of the causal theory of corruption that only human\nagents are possessed of minds and moral agency. Accordingly, on the\ncausal theory it is only human agents who culpably perform actions\nthat undermine legitimate institutional processes or purposes.\n\nA fourth and final feature of the causal theory also pertains to the\nagents who cause corruption. It is a further assumption of the causal\ntheory that the human agents who perform acts of corruption (the\ncorruptors) and/or the human agents who are corrupted (the corrupted)\nare necessarily institutional actors (see discussion above in\n section 2.1.3).\n More precisely, acts of institutional corruption necessarily involve\na corruptor who performs the corrupt action qua occupant of an\ninstitutional role and/or someone who is corrupted qua\noccupant of an institutional role.\n\nIn light of the above discussion the following normative theory of\ncorruption suggests itself: the causal theory of institutional\ncorruption (Miller 2017: Chapter 3).\n\nAn act x (whether a single or joint action) performed by an\nagent (or set of agents) A is an act of institutional\ncorruption if and only if:\n\nx has an effect, or is an instance of a kind of act that\nhas a tendency to have an effect, of undermining, or contributing to\nthe undermining of, some institutional process and/or purpose\n(understood as a collective good) of some institution, I,\nand/or an effect of contributing to the despoiling of the moral\ncharacter of some role occupant of I, agent (or set of\nagents) B, qua role occupant of I;\nAt least one of (a) or (b) is true:\n\n\nA is a role occupant of I who used the\nopportunities afforded by their role to perform x, and in so\ndoing A intended or foresaw the untoward effects in question,\nor should have foreseen them;\nB could have avoided the untoward effects, if\nB had chosen to do\n so.[5]\n \n\n\nNote that\n (2) (a)\n tells us that A is a corruptor and is, therefore, either\n(straightforwardly) morally responsible for the corrupt action, or\nA is not morally responsible for A\u2019s corrupt\ncharacter and the corrupt action is an expression of\nA\u2019s corrupt character.\n\nNotice also that the causal theory being cast in general terms, i.e.,\nthe undermining of institutional purposes, processes and/or persons\n(qua institutional role occupants), can accommodate a\ndiversity of corruption in a wide range of institutions in different\nsocial, political and economic settings, past and present, and\naccommodate also a wide range of mechanisms or structures of\ncorruption, including structural relations of dependency, collective\naction problems and so on.\n\nA controversial feature of the causal account is that organizations\nthat are entirely morally and legally illegitimate, such as criminal\norganizations, (e.g., the mafia), are not able to be corrupted (Lessig\n2013b). For on the causal account the condition of corruption exists\nonly relative to an uncorrupted condition, which is the condition of\nbeing a morally legitimate institution or sub-element thereof.\nConsider the uncorrupted judicial process. It consists of the\npresentation of objective evidence that has been gathered lawfully, of\ntestimony in court being presented truthfully, of the rights of the\naccused being respected, and so on. This otherwise morally legitimate\njudicial process may be corrupted, if one or more of its constitutive\nactions are not performed in accordance with the process as it ought\nto be. Thus to present fabricated evidence, to lie under oath, and so\non, are all corrupt actions. In relation to moral character, consider\nan honest accountant who begins to \u201cdoctor the books\u201d\nunder the twin pressures of a corrupt senior management and a desire\nto maintain a lifestyle that is only possible if he is funded by the\nvery high salary he receives for doctoring the books. By engaging in\nsuch a practice he risks the erosion of his moral character; he is\nundermining his disposition to act honestly.\n2.3 Theories of Political Corruption\n2.3.1 Proceduralist Theories of Political Corruption\n\nLet us term theories of corruption which focus on the undermining of\ninstitutional procedures or processes, as opposed to institutional\npurposes, proceduralist theories of institutional corruption. Mark\nWarren has elaborated a proceduralist theory of the corruption of\ndemocracies, in particular; a theory which he terms \u201cduplicitous\nexclusion\u201d (Warren 2006). (Relatedly and more recently, Ceva\n& Ferretti speak of bending public rules in the service of\n\u201csurreptitious agendas\u201d as definitive of corruption (Ceva\n& Ferretti 2017: 6), although in a recent work they have shifted\nto a notion of corruption in terms of lack of accountability (Ceva\n& Ferretti 2018; Ceva & Ferretti 2021). See discussion below\nin 2.3.4.)\n\nDemocratic political institutions are characterized by equality (in\nsome sense) with respect to these processes. Warren offers a\nparticular account of democratic equality and derives his notion of\ncorruption of democratic political institutions from this. According\nto Warren, democracies involve a norm of equal inclusion such that\n\n\nevery individual potentially affected by a collective decision should\nhave an opportunity to affect the decision proportional to his or her\nstake in the outcome. (Warren 2004: 333)\n\n\nCorruption of democracies occurs under two conditions: (1) this norm\nis violated and; (2) violators claim to be complying with the norm\n(Warren 2004: 337). Warren contrasts his theory of duplicitous\nexclusion with what he terms \u201coffice-based\u201d accounts\n(Warren 2004:329\u201332).The latter might be serviceable for\nadministrative agencies and roles but is, according to Warren,\ninadequate for democratic representatives attempting to \u201cdefine\nthe public interest\u201d (Warren 2006: 10) and relying essentially\non the political process, rather than pre-existing agreement on\nspecific ends or purposes, to do so. This latter point is made in one\nway of another by other theorists of modern representative\ndemocracies, such as Thompson (2013) and Ceva & Ferretti (2017:\n5), and is an objection to teleological accounts (such as the causal\n account\u2014section 2.2\n above).\n\nWarren\u2019s other necessary condition for the corruption of\ninstitutions, namely duplicity, resonates with the emphasis in the\ncontemporary anti-corruption literature and, for that matter, in much\npublic policy on transparency; transparency can reveal duplicity and\nthereby thwart corruptors. Moreover, the duplicity condition\u2014and\nthe related surreptitious agenda condition of Ceva &\nFerretti\u2014is reminiscent of Plato\u2019s ring of Gyges (Plato\nGorgias); corruption is something done under a cloak of\nsecrecy and typically involves deception to try to ensure the cloak is\nnot removed. Unquestionably, corruption often flourishes under\nconditions of secrecy. Moreover, corruptors frequently seek to deceive\nby presenting themselves a committed to the standards that they are\n(secretly) violating. But contra Warren\u2014and, for that matter,\nCeva & Ferretti\u2014corruption does not necessarily or always\nneed to be hidden in order to flourish. Indeed, in polities and\ninstitutions suffering from the most serious and widespread forms of\ncorruption at the hands of the very powerful, there is often little or\nno need for secrecy or deception in relation to the pursuit of corrupt\npractices; corruption is out in the open. Consider Colombia during the\nperiod of the drug lord, Pablo Escobar\u2019s, \u201creign\u201d;\nthe period of the so-called \u201cnarcocracy\u201d. His avowed and\nwell-advertised policy was \u201csilver or lead\u201d, meaning that\npoliticians, judges, journalists and so on either accepted a bribe or\nrisked being killed (Bowden 2012). Against this it might be suggested\nthat at least corruption in democracies always involves hiding\none\u2019s corrupt practices. Unfortunately, this seems not to be the\ncase either. As Plato pointed out long ago in The Republic,\ndemocracies can suffer a serious problem of corruption among the\ncitizenry and when this happens all manner of corrupt practices on the\npart of leaders and others will not only be visible, they will be\ntolerated, and even celebrated.\n\nWarren\u2019s theory is evidently not generalizable to many other\ninstitutions, namely, those that are not centrally governed by\ndemocratic norms and, in particular, by his norm of equal inclusion.\nConsider, for instance, military institutions. Most important\ndecisions made by military personal in wartime\u2014as opposed to\nthose made by their political masters, such as whether to go to war in\nthe first place\u2014are made in the context of a hierarchical\nstructure; they are not collective decisions, if the notion of a\ncollective decision is to be understood on a democratic model of\ndecision-making, e.g., representative democracy. Moreover, with\nrespect to, for instance, the decision to retreat or stand and fight a\ncombatant does not and cannot reasonably expect to have \u201can\nopportunity to affect the decision proportional to her stake in the\noutcome\u201d. The combatant\u2019s personal stake might be very\nhigh; his life is at risk if he stands and fights and, therefore, he\nmight prefer to retreat. However, military necessity in a just war\nmight dictate that he and his comrades stand and fight and, therefore,\nthey are ordered to do so by their superiors back at headquarters and,\nas virtuous combatants, they obey. I note that Machiavelli contrasts\ncombatants possessed of the martial virtues with corruptible\nmercenaries who only fight for money and who desert when their lives\nare threatened (Machiavelli The Prince: Chapter 12).\n2.3.2 Thompson: Individual versus Institutional Corruption\n\nThompson\u2019s groundbreaking and influential theory of\ninstitutional corruption takes as its starting point a distinction\nbetween what Thompson refers to as individual corruption and\ninstitutional corruption. When an official accepts a bribe in return\nfor providing a service to the briber, this is individual corruption\nsince the official is accepting a personal benefit or gain in exchange\nfor promoting private interests (Thompson 2013: 6). Moreover, the\nfollowing two conditions evidently obtain: (i) the official intends to\nprovide the service (or, at least, intends to give the impression that\nhe will provide the service) to the bribee; (ii) the official and the\nbribee intentionally create the link between the bribe and the\nservice, i.e., it is a quid quo pro. By contrast,\ninstitutional corruption involves political benefits or gains, e.g.,\ncampaign contributions (that do not go into the political\ncandidates\u2019 own pockets but are actually spent on the campaigns)\nby public officials under conditions that tend to promote private\ninterests (Thompson 2013: 6). The reference to a tendency entails that\nthere is some kind of causal regularity in the link between acceptance\nof the political benefits and promotion of the private interests\n(including greater access to politicians than is available to others\n(Thompson 2018)). However, the officials in question do not intend\nthat there be such a link between the political benefits they accept\nand their promotion of the private interests of the provider of the\npolitical benefits. Rather\n\n\nthe fact that an official acts under conditions that tend to create\nimproper influence is sufficient to establish corruption, whatever the\nofficial\u2019s motive. (Thompson 2013: 13)\n\n\nI note that in the case of institutional corruption and, presumably,\nindividual corruption (in so far as it involves the bribery of public\nor private officials) the actions in question must undermine some\ninstitutional process or purpose (and/or perhaps institutional role\noccupant qua role occupant). Thus Thompson says of\ninstitutional corruption:\n\n\nIt is not corrupt if the practice promotes (or at least does not\ndamage) political competition, citizenship representation, or other\ncore processes of the institution. But it is corrupt if it is of a\ntype that tends to undermine such processes and thereby frustrate the\nprimary purposes of the institution. (Thompson 2013: 7)\n\n\nWhile Thompson has provided an important analysis of an important\nspecies of institutional corruption, his additional claim that\nofficials who accept personal benefits in exchange for promoting\nprivate interests, i.e., a common form of bribery, is not a species of\ninstitutional corruption is open to question (and a point of\ndifference with the causal theory). As mentioned in\n section 1,\n this species of bribery of institutional actors utilizing their\nposition\u2014whether that position be one in the public sector or in\nthe private sector\u2014can be systemic and, therefore, extremely\ndamaging to institutions. Consider the endemic bribery of police in\nIndia with its attendant undermining of the provision of impartial\n(Kurer 2005; Rothstein & Varraich 2017), obligatory (Kolstad 2012)\nand effective police services, not to mention of public trust in the\npolice. Some police stations in part of India are little more than\nunlawful \u201ctax\u201d collection or, better, extortion agencies;\nlocal business people have to pay the local police if they are to\nguarantee effective police protection, truck drivers have to pay\nbribes to the police at transport checkpoints, if they are to transit\nexpeditiously through congested areas, speeding tickets are avoided by\nthose who pay bribes, and so on. Moreover, endemic bribery of this\nkind is endemic in many police forces and other public sector agencies\nthroughout so-called developing countries, even if it is no longer\npresent in most developed countries.\n\nThompson invokes the distinction between systemic and episodic\nservices provided by a public official in support of his distinction\nbetween individual and institutional corruption. By\n\u201csystemic\u201d Thompson means that the service provided by the\nofficial\n\n\nis provided through a persistent pattern of relationships, rather than\nin episodic or one-time interactions. (The particular relationships do\nnot themselves have to be ongoing: a recurrent set of one-time\ninteractions by the same politician with different recipients could\ncreate a similar pattern.) (Thompson 2013: 11)\n\n\nHowever, as our above example of bribery of police in India makes\nclear, Thompson\u2019s individual corruption can be, and often is,\nsystemic in precisely this sense. In more recent work Thompson has\ndrawn attention to mixed cases involving, for instance, both a\npersonal and a political gain\u2014the political gain not necessarily\nbeing a motive\u2014and suggested that if the dominant gain is\npolitical rather than personal then it is institutional corruption or\nperhaps a mix of individual and institutional corruption (Thompson\n2018). Fair enough. However, this does not remove the objection that\nsystemic bribery (for instance) involving only personal gain (both as\na motive and an outcome) are, nevertheless, cases of institutional\ncorruption.\n\nThompson uses the case of Charles Keating to outline his theory\n(Thompson 1995 and 2013). Keating was a property developer who made\ngenerous contributions to the election campaigns of various U.S.\npoliticians, notably five senators, and then at a couple of meetings\ncalled on a number of these to do him a favor in return. Specifically,\nKeating wanted the senators to get a regulatory authority to refrain\nfrom seizing the assets of a subsidiary of a company owned by Keating.\nThe chair of the regulatory authority was replaced. However, two years\nlater the assets of the company in question were seized and\nauthorities filed a civil racketeering and fraud suit against Keating\naccusing him of diverting funds from the company to his family and to\npolitical campaigns. Thompson argues that the Keating case involved:\n(1) the provision or, at least, the appearance of the provision of an\nimproper service on the part of legislators (the senators) to a\nconstituent (Keating), i.e., interfering with the role of a regulator\non his behalf; (2) a political gain in the form of campaign\ncontributions (from Keating to the senators), and; (3) a link or, at\nleast, the appearance of a link between (1) and (2), i.e., the\ntendency under these conditions for the service to be performed\nbecause of the political gain.\n\nAccordingly, the case study involves at least the appearance of\ncorrupt activity on the part of the senators. Moreover, Thompson\nclaims that such an appearance might be sufficient for institutional\ncorruption in that damage has been done to a political institution by\nvirtue of a diminution in public trust in that institution. Thus the\nappearance of a conflict of interest undermines public trust which in\nturn damages the institution. The appearance of a conflict of interest\narises when legislators use their office to provide a questionable\n\u201cservice\u201d to a person upon whom they are, or have been,\nheavily reliant for campaign contributions. Evidently, on\nThompson\u2019s account of institutional (as opposed to individual)\ncorruption it is not necessary that the legislators in these kinds of\ncircumstance ought to know that their actions might well have the\nappearance of a conflict of interest, ought to know that they might\nhave a resulting damaging effect, and ought to know, therefore, that\nthey ought not to have performed those actions. Certainly, the\nsenators in the Keating case ought to have known that they ought not\nto perform these actions. However, the more general point is that it\nis not clear that it would be a case of corruption, if it were\nnot the case that the legislators in question ought to have\nknown that they ought not to perform the institutionally damaging\nactions in question. On the causal account\n (section 2.2\n above), if legislators or other officials perform institutionally\ndamaging actions that they could not reasonably be expected to know\nwould be institutionally damaging then they have not engaged in\ncorruption but rather incidental institutional damage (and perhaps\ncorrosion if the actions are ongoing).\n\nAs outlined above, Thompson has made a detailed application of his\ntheory to political institutions and, especially to campaign financing\nin the U.S.. However, he views the theory as generalizable to\ninstitutions other than political ones. It is generalizable, he\nargues, in so far as \u201cpublic purposes\u201d can be replaced by\n\u201cinstitutional purposes\u201d and \u201cdemocratic\nprocess\u201d with \u201clegitimate institutional procedures\u201d\n(Thompson 2013: 5). Certainly, if the theory is to be generalizable\nthen it is necessary that these replacements be made. The question is\nwhether making these replacements is sufficient. Moreover, the\nparticular species of institutional corruption that he has identified\nand analyzed might exist in other institutions but do so alongside a\nwide range of other species to which his analysis does not\napply\u2014including, but not restricted to, what he refers to as\nindividual corruption. Thompson has recently identified some other\nforms of institutional corruption to which he claims his theory\napplies (Thompson 2018). For instance, the close relationship that\nmight obtain between corporations and their auditing firms. The\nsalient such relationships are those consisting of auditing firms\nundertaking profitable financial consultancy work for the very\ncorporations which they are auditing; hence the potential for the\nindependent auditing process to be compromised. These relationships\ncertainly have the potential for corruption. However, they do not\nappear to be paradigms of institutional corruption in Thompson\u2019s\nsense since, arguably, undertaking such consultancy work is not\nprima facie an integral function of auditing firms\nqua auditors in the manner in which, for instance, securing\ncampaign finance is integral to political parties competing in an\nelection (to mention Thompson\u2019s paradigmatic example of\ninstitutional corruption).\n\nNewhouse has attempted to generalize Thompson\u2019 theory, but in\ndoing so also narrows it. Newhouse argues that Thompson\u2019s theory\nis best understood in terms of breach of organizational fiduciary\nduties (Newhouse 2014). An important underlying reason for this, says\nNewhouse, is that Thompson\u2019s (and, for that matter,\nLessig\u2019s) account of institutional corruption presuppose that\ninstitutions have an \u201cobligatory purpose\u201d (Newhouse 2014:\n555) Fiduciary duties are, of course, obligatory. Moreover, they are\nwidespread in both the public and private sector; hence the theory\nwould be generalized. On the other hand, there are many institutional\nactors who do not have fiduciary duties. Thus if Newhouse is correct\nin thinking that Thompson\u2019s theory of institutional corruption\nprovides a model for breach of organizational fiduciary duty and\nonly for breach of organizational fiduciary duty, the\nambition to generalize Thompson\u2019s theory will remain\nsubstantially unrealized.\n2.3.3 Lessig\u2019s Dependence Corruption\n\nLawrence Lessig has argued that the U.S. democratic political process\nand, indeed, Congress itself, is institutionally corrupt and that the\ncorruption in question is a species of what he calls \u201cdependency\ncorruption\u201d (Lessig 2011 and 2013a). Lessig argues that although\nU.S. citizens as a whole vote in the election of, say, the U.S.\nPresident, nevertheless, the outcome is not wholly dependent on these\ncitizens as it should be in a democracy or, at least, as is required\nby the U.S. Constitution. For the outcome is importantly dependent on\na small group of \u201cFunders\u201d who bankroll particular\ncandidates and without whose funding no candidate could hope to win\noffice. Accordingly, there are really two elections. In the first\nelection only the Funders get to \u201cvote\u201d since only they\nhave sufficient funds to support a political candidate. Once these\ncandidate have been \u201celected\u201d then there is a second\nelection, a general election, in which all the citizens get to vote.\nHowever, they can only vote on the list of candidates\n\u201cpre-selected\u201d by the Funders. Lessig\u2019s account of\nthe U.S. election is complicated, but not vitiated, by the existence\nof a minority of candidates, such as Bernie Sanders, who rely on\nfunding consisting of small amounts of money from a very large number\nof Funders. It is further complicated but not necessarily vitiated by\nthe rise of demagogues such as Donald Trump who, as mentioned above,\ncan utilise social media and computational propaganda to have an\nelectoral influence much greater than otherwise might have been the\ncase (Woolley and Howard 2019).\n\nOn Lessig\u2019s view there are two dependencies in play, namely, the\ndependency of the outcome of the election on the citizenry and the\ndependency of this outcome on the Funders. However, these two\ndependencies are inconsistent. Therefore, the question that now arises\nis which dependency is legitimate. Clearly, the dependency on the\ncitizenry as a whole is legitimate since this is what the Constitution\nclearly intended. Since these funders are not representative of the\nU.S. citizenry the dependency on the Funders is illegitimate and a\ncorruption of the democratic process in the U.S..\n\nLessig states that his notion of dependency corruption cuts across\nThompson\u2019s notions of individual and institutional corruption\n(Lessig 2013a: 14). Regarding the relation to Thompson\u2019s notion\nof institutional corruption: On the one hand, dependence corruption\ninvolves a tendency, as does Thompson\u2019s notion of institutional\ncorruption (see above\n section 2.3.2).\n On the other hand, on Thompson\u2019s theory, a politician, or set\nof politicians, can receive campaign contributions from Funders and\nfurther their private interests without being dependent on them. So in\nthis respect Thompson\u2019s notion of institutional corruption is\nwider than Lessig\u2019s notion of dependence corruption. Regarding\nthe relation to Thompson\u2019s notion of individual corruption: A\npolitician, or set of politicians, may come to depend on personal\nbenefits from Funders. This is dependence corruption but on\nThompson\u2019s theory it is presumably individual corruption.\n(Although, perhaps, it might not be individual corruption in\nThompson\u2019s sense, if it involves a regularity and hence\ntendency).\n\nLessig offers a plausible analysis of the corruption of the U.S.\nelectoral system by the Funders. Two related questions now arise. Is\nLessig\u2019s theory of dependence corruption correct? Is the notion\nof dependence corruption generalizable to institutions other than\npolitical institutions and, if so, to what extent?\n\nThe extent to which Lessig\u2019s notion of dependence corruption is\ngeneralizable is ultimately an empirical question; it is a matter of\nseeking to apply it widely and waiting on the outcome (see, for\ninstance, Light\u2019s analysis of corruption in the pharmaceutical\nindustry (Light, Lexchin, & Darrow 2013)). However, as mentioned\nabove in the comparison of Lessig\u2019s account with that of\nThompson, Lessig does not see his dependence account as entirely\ngeneralizable.\n\nUnlike the causal account of corruption (see\n section 2.2\n above), Lessig\u2019s notion of institutional corruption commits him\nonly to normatively neutral institutional purposes (Lessig 2014;\nLessig 2013b: 14) rather than to morally good or otherwise valuable\ninstitutional purposes. Accordingly, by Lessig\u2019s lights, to say\nof a university that it has as a fundamental purpose to educate (to\nsome objectively acceptable, minimum standard) is merely to say that\nthis is a de facto fundamental purpose. Therefore, being\nmarket-based it could change its order of priorities; i.e., it would\nbe perfectly entitled to prioritize profit over educational standards,\njust as, for instance, a retail store is perfectly entitled to\nprioritize profit over its standards of service to its customers.\n\nAccording to Lessig, dependence corruption does not necessarily\ninvolve corrupt persons. As we have seen, Lessig\u2019s favored\nexample of dependence corruption is the dependency of the outcome of\nU.S. elections on a small group of large funders of those campaigning\nfor political office rather than on the American people. Lessig\nsuggests that those who engage in dependence corruption could be\n\u201cgood souls\u201d (Lessig 2011: 17). Here we need to keep in\nmind distinctions between being evil and being corrupt, and between\nbeing corrupt and being morally responsible for one\u2019s\ncorruption. A corrupt person is not necessarily an evil person. After\nall, as we have seen, a corrupt person might only be corrupt\nqua institutional actor. Thus a corrupt police officer might\nbe a good father and husband. Moreover, corruption admits of degrees.\nSo a corrupt police officer might be a so-called grass-eater rather\nthan a so-called meat-eater; their corrupt character might only\nmanifest itself in relatively minor forms of corruption, e.g., minor\nbribe-taking, rather than in major forms of corruption, e.g.,\non-selling large quantities of heroin seized from drug dealers.\n\nWhat of moral responsibility and corruption? Consider Lessig\u2019s\nown favored example of dependence corruption. Surely, moral\nresponsibility for corruption of the U.S. electoral system can be\nassigned to U.S. legislators, in particular, as well as the Funders\nwho finance campaigns in the expectation (presumably) of favorable\nlegislation if their candidates are elected. Lessig distinguishes\nbetween\n\n\nresponsibility for changing individual behavior within the system and\nresponsibility for changing the system itself. (Lessig 2013a: 15)\n\n\nAccording to Lessig\n\n\nthe sin of a Congressman within such a system is not that she raises\ncampaign money. It is that she doesn\u2019t work to change the\ncorruption that this dependence upon a small set of funders produced.\n(Lessig 2013a: 15)\n\n\nSo apparently direct participation in the corruption of the electoral\nsystem by legislators and (?) Funders is not a sin. Lessig\u2019s\nclaim here might be that the corruptors of the U.S. electoral system\nare not engaged in sinful acts because they are not morally\nresponsible for this wrongdoing. This claim is open to question. The\nactions of the legislators and Funders (and, for that matter, the\nlobbyists) that are constitutive of dependence corruption (offering\nand receiving (directly and indirectly) campaign funds) are avoidable\nand the legislators and Funders are, or ought to be, aware of the\ninstitutional damage being done by their combined actions. Moreover,\nin suggesting that the legislators have a moral responsibility to\nchange the system, Lessig, in effect, concedes as much. How could they\nhave a moral responsibility to change the system if they were not\naware of it and their role in it?\n\nWhat might be influencing Lessig at this point is the degree of the\nmoral responsibility, specifically, full and partial responsibility.\nIt is the combined effect of the many individual actions of a large\nnumber of legislators (and Funders and lobbyists) that does the\ninstitutional damage. Therefore, each only makes a small causal\ncontribution and each, therefore, only has a small share in the moral\nresponsibility for the outcome. Moreover, in relation to changing the\nsystem, there is a need for joint action; it is a joint moral\nresponsibility involving shared partial individual\nresponsibility. Thus legislators could, and know they could, jointly\nact to enact campaign finance reform to address the problem of\ndependency by, for example, restricting campaign contributions.\nAccordingly, the moral responsibility in play is a species of\ncollective responsibility; specifically, joint moral responsibility\n(Miller 2010: Chapter 4).\n2.3.4 Ceva & Ferretti: Office Accountability\n\nCeva & Ferretti understand political corruption widely to include\nnot only the corruption of politicians but of public officials in\ngeneral, including police officers, members of the professions, such\nas doctors and teachers, and others in the public sector. They define\npolitical corruption in terms of two individually necessary and\njointly sufficient conditions: \u201cThere must be a public official\nwho (1) acts in her institutional capacity as an officeholder (office\ncondition) (2) for the pursuit of an agenda whose rationale may not be\nvindicated as coherent with the terms of the mandate of her power of\noffice (mandate condition)\u201d (Ceva & Ferretti 2021: 19). The\nfirst condition, namely that political corruption involves a public\nofficial who acts in her institutional capacity, is familiar (see\nabove). What of condition (2), the mandate condition?\n\nThe mandate condition concerns the motive or reason guiding the office\nholder\u2019s action; the action is performed for the pursuit of an\nagenda with a rationale. So the officeholder\u2019s action considered\nin itself might or might not be an exercise of a constitutive\ninstitutional right or duty of the office in question. But what is\nthis rationale that would render the action corrupt? The rationale in\nquestion is one that \u201cmay not be vindicated as coherent with the\nterms of the mandate of her power of office\u201d. The key notion\nhere is that of coherence with the mandate of the powers of office.\nHere the powers of office are presumably simply the institutional\nrights and duties constitutive of an office, e.g., the right of\nlegislators to vote on legislation, the duty not to take bribes. So,\nin summary, corruption involves the performance of an action(s) the\nmotivating reason for which does not cohere with the mandate\nauthorizing an office holder\u2019s rights and duties qua office\nholder.\n\nCeva & Ferretti further argue that the relations between\norganizational roles generate a deontic dimension. For instance, they\nsay: \u201cOffice accountability governs the institutional relations\nbetween office holders. As participants in these relations,\nofficeholders are established with the authority to require that one\nanother \u2018gives an account\u2019 of their actions\u201d (Ceva\n& Ferretti 2021: 25). They provide the example of a physician:\n\u201cBy following this course of action, the physician is also in\nthe position of justifying her conduct to her colleagues with\nreference to the terms of her power mandate, thus fulfilling office\naccountability. By her action, the physician is accountable not only\nto the other doctors\u2026but also to the hospital staff\u201d\n(Ceva & Ferretti 2021:26).\n\nCeva & Ferretti also address the question, What is wrong with\ncorruption? In doing so they offer a distinctive theory. According to\nthem political corruption is inherently wrong (as opposed to wrong by\nvirtue of its consequences) because it is \u201ca specific form of\ninteractive injustice consisting in a violation of the duty of office\naccountability\u201d (Ceva & Ferretti 2021: 122). Thus, it turns\nout that political corruption is inherently wrong because it is\nunjust. More specifically, political corruption involves an action by\nan institutional member which is unjust to his colleagues since each\nmember owes it to every other member to do his duty.\n\nA question might arise at this point in relation to the scope of the\nnotion of an institution that Ceva & Ferretti\u2019s employ in\ntheir account of political corruption (understood as corruption of\npublic institutions). For instance, are those who are entitled to vote\nin a democracy themselves institutional role occupants of the\ninstitution of government? Are patients in a public hospital\nthemselves role occupants of the hospital or students in a public\nschool role occupants of the school? Ceva & Ferretti deploy an\naccount of a public institution according to which the answer to these\nquestions is in each case in the negative. For on their account of the\ncorruption of public institutions there must be an officeholder\npossessed of a mandate who engages in corruption. But citizens,\nhospital patients and school students are not office holders with\nmandates. Indeed, citizens are the source of the mandate as, arguably\n(supposing there is a mandate), are patients and if not students, at\nleast their parents (on the students\u2019 behalf). One untoward\nconsequence of this view is that evidently citizens, patients and\nstudents cannot themselves directly engage in acts of corruption\n(understood as corruption of public institutions) or, at least, if\nthey can their actions would fall outside Ceva & Ferretti\u2019s\ntheory of institutional corruption.\n\nAt any rate, to return to the question of the wrongness of corruption,\nwe saw above that on Ceva & Ferretti\u2019s view this consists in\ncorruption being a form of interactive injustice. Accordingly,\ninteractive justice goes hand in glove with office accountability. On\nthis view a teacher who fails students who do not provide her with\nsexual favors, and gives high marks to those who do, is performing\ncorrupt actions by virtue of her unjust treatment of her teaching\ncolleagues. Ceva & Ferretti argue that the normative source\n(relevant to the inherent wrongness of corrupt actions) of the\nprinciple of impartiality in the practice of the assessment by\nteachers of their students\u2019 work lies in the role-based\nrelations that the teacher has with her fellow teachers (and other\nschool staff) (Ceva & Ferretti 2021: 98). So this teacher\u2019s\naction is not corrupt by virtue of the injustice done to the students\n(although Ceva & Ferretti agree that it would be unfair to the\nstudents), but rather by virtue of the injustice done to the\nteacher\u2019s colleagues. Contrary to Ceva & Ferretti it could\nreasonably be claimed that the primary form of institutional\ncorruption involved here lies in the corruption of the teacher-student\nrelationship (and its harmful consequences). More generally, Ceva\n& Ferretti\u2019s theory of political corruption evidently\nprivileges relationships between office holders at the expense of\nthose whom they serve.\n3. Noble Cause Corruption\n\nAs we saw earlier, in the paradigm cases corrupt actions are a species\nof morally wrong, habitual, actions. What of the motive for corrupt\nactions? We saw above that there are many motives for corrupt actions,\nincluding desires for wealth, status, and power. However, there is\napparently at least one motive that we might think ought not to be\nassociated with corruption, namely, acting for the sake of the good.\nHere we need to be careful. For sometimes actions that are done for\nthe sake of the good are, nevertheless, morally wrong actions. Indeed,\nsome actions that are done out of a desire to achieve the good are\ncorrupt actions, namely, acts of so-called noble cause corruption.\n\nThis is not the place to provide a detailed treatment of the\nphenomenon of noble cause corruption (Kleinig 2002; Miller 2016:\nChapter 3). Rather let us simply note that even in cases of noble\ncause corruption\u2014contra what the person who performs the action\nthinks\u2014it may well be the case that the corrupt action morally\nought not to be performed; or at least the corrupt action is pro\ntanto morally wrong, even if it is morally permissible all things\nconsidered. Accordingly, the person who performs it may well be\ndeceiving him or herself, or be simply mistaken when they judge that\nthe action morally ought to be performed. So their motive, i.e., to\nact for the sake of what is right, has a moral deficiency. They are\nonly acting for the sake of what they believe is morally\nright, but in fact it is not morally right; their belief is a false\nbelief. So we can conclude that corrupt actions are habitual actions\nthat are at the very least pro tanto morally wrong and quite\npossibly morally wrong all things considered, and therefore in all\nprobability not motivated by the true belief that they are\nmorally right.\n\nHere there are more complex excuses and justifications available for\nwhat might first appear to be an act of noble cause corruption.\nPerhaps a police officer did not know that some form of evidence was\nnot admissible. The police officer\u2019s false belief that an action\nis right (putting forward the evidence in a court of law) was\nrationally dependent on some false non-moral belief (that the evidence\nwas admissible); and the police officer came to hold that non-moral\nbelief as a result of a rational process (he was informed, or at least\nmisinformed, that the evidence was admissible by a senior officer).\nThis would incline us to say that the putative act of noble cause\ncorruption was not really an act of corruption\u2014although it might\nserve to undermine a morally legitimate institutional\nprocess\u2014and therefore not an act of noble cause corruption. This\nintuition is consistent with the causal account of corruption in\nparticular. The police officer in question did perform an action that\nundermined a legitimate criminal justice process. However, his action\nwas not corrupt because he is not a corruptor. He did not intend to\nundermine the process, he did not foresee that the process would be\nundermined, and (let us assume) he could not reasonably have been\nexpected to foresee that it would be undermined. Nor is his action the\nexpression of a corrupt character.\n\nEarlier, it was suggested that acts of noble cause corruption are\npro tanto morally wrong and that this is typically contra\nwhat the actor believes. However, it is conceivable that some\nacts of noble cause corruption are morally justified all things\nconsidered. Perhaps the act of noble cause corruption while wrong\nin itself, nevertheless, was morally justified from an all\nthings considered standpoint. If so, we might conclude that the action\nwas not an act of corruption (and therefore not an act of noble cause\ncorruption). Alternatively, we might conclude that it was an act of\ncorruption, but one of those few acts of corruption that was justified\nin the circumstances. Perhaps both options are possibilities.\n\nSuppose an undercover police officer offers a \u201cbribe\u201d to a\ncorrupt judge for the purpose, supposedly, of getting the judge to\npass a lenient sentence on a known mafia crime boss. The police\nofficer is actually engaged in a so-called \u201csting\u201d\noperation as part of an anti-corruption strategy. The judge accepts\nthe bribe and is duly convicted of a criminal offence and jailed. (Let\nus also assume that the judge is already so corrupt that he will not\nbe further corrupted by being offered the bribe.) The police officer\noffers the bribe for the purpose of achieving a moral good, i.e.,\nconvicting a corrupt official. However, we are disinclined to call\nthis a case of corruption. Presumably the reason for this is that in\nthis context the \u201cbribe\u201d does not have a corrupting\neffect; in particular, it does not succeed in undermining the judicial\nprocess of sentencing the crime boss. So this is a case in which a\nprima facie act of noble cause corruption turns out not be an\nact of corruption, and therefore not an act of noble cause corruption.\nA less straightforward case is the one where the action does have a\ncorrupting effect. Consider two possibilities: (i) The sting is\ncontinued for a while (to catch other corrupt judges) and paid for (by\nbribes) verdicts are temporarily enforced during the sting; (ii) The\nprocess of considering and accepting the money offered by the\ndisguised police officer further despoils the judge\u2019s character\nbut has no further effect on court proceedings (because the judge is\narrested within minutes). In both cases, arguably, the officer\nconducting the sting operations committed an act of corruption.\n\nWhat of morally justified acts of noble cause corruption. Suppose\nsomeone bribes an immigration official in order to ensure that his\nfriend\u2014who is ineligible to enter Australia\u2014can in fact\nenter Australia, and thereby have access to life-saving hospital\ntreatment. This act of bribery is evidently an act of institutional\ncorruption; a legitimate institutional process has been subverted.\nHowever, the person acted for the sake of doing what he believed to be\nmorally right; his action was an instance of noble cause corruption.\nMoreover, from an all things considered standpoint\u2014and in\nparticular, in the light of the strength of the moral obligations owed\nto close friends when their lives are at risk\u2014his action may\nwell be morally justified. Accordingly, his act of corruption may well\nnot have a corrupting effect on himself. Plausibly, this explains any\ntendency we might have not to describe his action as an action of\ncorruption. But from the fact that the person was not corrupted it\ndoes not follow that the act did not corrupt. Moreover, it does not\neven follow that some person or other was not corrupted. Clearly, in\nour example, the immigration official was corrupted and, therefore,\nthe action was pro tanto morally wrong, even if the action\nwas morally right all things considered.\n\nIn this section the following propositions have been advanced: (a) the\nphenomenon of noble cause corruption is a species of corruption, and\nit is seen to be so by the lights of the causal account of corruption\nin particular; (b) conceivably, some acts of noble cause corruption\nare morally justified all things considered; (c) instances of\nstructural corruption favored by Lessig and/or Thompson are\npotentially cases of noble cause corruption, but this is not\nnecessarily the case.\n4. Integrity Systems\n\nThus far our concern has been with theorizing institutional\ncorruption. Indeed, most of the philosophical work undertaken to date\nhas consisted in such theorizing. However, there are some salient\nexceptions to this. For instance, Pogge has suggested undermining the\ninternational borrowing privileges of authoritarian governments who\nhave removed democratic governments (Pogge 2002 [2008]: Chapter 10);\nWenar (2016) argues for the enforcement of property rights (popular\nresource sovereignty) in relation to the resources curse; Lessig\n(Lessig 2011) has elaborated a raft of specific measures to reform the\nsystem of campaign contributions in the U.S.; Alexandra and Miller\n(2010) have outlined ways to utilize reputational devices in some\nsectors in which reputational loss hurts the \u201cbottom line\u201d\n(see also Brennan & Pettit 2005 for an account of the theoretical\nunderpinnings of such practical reforms).\n\nHowever, at a more general level there is an apparent need on the part\nof philosophers to conceptualize the notion of an anti-corruption\nsystem or, more broadly, an integrity system for institutions\n(Klitgaard 1988; Pope 1997; Anechiarico & Jacobs 1998; Klitgaard\net al. 2000; Preston & Sampford 2002; Baker 2005; Miller 2017). An\nintegrity system is an institutional arrangement the purpose of which\nis to promote ethical attitudes and behavior and, crucially, to\nprevent or, at least, reduce institutional corruption. For instance,\nan integrity system for a police organization might consist of a set\nof laws and regulations, an internal affairs department comprised of\ncorruption investigators, an external oversight body, professional\nreporting mechanisms, an enforceable code of ethics, a complaints and\ndiscipline process, and so on. The contribution of philosophers to\nintegrity systems has been threefold. Firstly, they have offered\nsynoptic or \u201cbirds-eye\u201d views of the architecture of such\nsystems and in so doing determined whether they are fit for normative\ninstitutional purpose. Naturally, this work presupposes theories of\nthe normative institutional purposes of the institutions in question\n(Lessig 2011; Thompson 1995). Secondly, they have addressed a variety\nof ethical issues that have arisen in the design and implementation of\nintegrity systems and their various institutional components.\nConsider, for instance, the range of ethical issues that arise in\nrelation to anti-corruption systems for police organizations, e.g.,\nentrapment, privacy/surveillance (Miller 2016). Thirdly, they have\nidentified the underlying causal and/or rational basis of the\ncorruption and, in light of this, designed appropriate anti-corruption\nmeasures. (Pogge 2002 [2008]: Chapter 6; Lessig 2011); van den Hoven,\nMiller, & Pogge 2017). An important set of structural problems\nfacilitating corruption are collective action problems, e.g.,\nregulatory arbitrage in the global financial system and tax havens\n(Obermayer & Obermaier 2016; Rothstein & Varraich 2017). One\nkind of solution proposed is that of an enforceable cooperative scheme\nat the international level (Eatwell & Taylor 2000).\n\nIntegrity systems can be thought of as being either predominantly\nreactive or predominantly preventive, albeit the distinction is\nsomewhat artificial since there is always a need for both reactive\nelements, e.g., investigations of corrupt actions, and preventive\nelements, e.g., ethics training and transparency mechanisms. Reactive\nsystems are fundamentally linear. They frame laws and regulation that\nset out a series of offences, wait for transgressions, investigate,\nadjudicate and take punitive measures. In many areas, including\ninstitutional corruption, resources are limited and, thus, ethically\ninformed decisions have to be made in relation to the prioritization\nof corrupt activity to be investigated and to what extent. This\nethical problem is to be distinguished from the problem of\nunder-resourcing motivated by a desire to hamstring anti-corruption\ninitiatives. Moreover, both problems are to be distinguished from the\ndebate between those who favor increased laws and regulations to\ncombat, for instance, financial corruption, and those who argue for a\ndecrease in such laws and regulations since they unnecessarily\nincrease the cost of doing business.\n\nPreventive institutional mechanisms for combating corruption can be\ndivided into four categories. Mechanisms designed to reduce the\nmotivation to engage in corruption, e.g., ethics education programs;\nmechanisms to reduce the capacity of those motivated to engage in\ncorruption, e.g., legislation to downsize oligopolies to prevent\ncartels (Rose-Ackerman 1999), exploitation of the lack of trust\nbetween corruptors (Lambsdorff 2007), democratization and the\nseparation of powers (\u201cpower corrupts\u201d (Acton 1887 [1948:\n364]) to reign in powerful, corrupt governments (Johnston 2014);\nmechanisms to eliminate or reduce the opportunity to engage in\ncorruption, e.g., conflict of interest provisions; mechanisms to\nexpose corrupt behavior, e.g., oversight bodies, media organizations\n(Pope 1997; Spence et al. 2011).\n\nIt is self-evident that there is need for both reactive and preventive\nelements if an integrity system is to be adequate. This point obtains\nwhether or not the integrity system in question pertains to a single\norganization, an industry, an occupational group, or an entire\nsociety. However, the reactive and preventive elements need to cohere\nin an overall holistic integrity system (Miller 2017). A further point\noften overlooked is that if an integrity system is to be effective it\npresupposes a framework of accepted social norms in the sense of\nsocially accepted moral principles. Social norms provide the standards\nwhich determine what counts as corruption. Moreover, in so doing they\ndetermine whether or not such behavior will be tolerated or not.\nRevealing corruption has very little effect if the wider community to\nwhom the corruption is revealed are tolerant or otherwise accepting of\nit.\n5. Conclusion\n\nCorruption is a highly diverse phenomenon, including bribery,\nnepotism, false testimony, cheating, abuse of authority and so on.\nMoreover, corruption takes different forms across the spectrum of\ninstitutions giving rise to political corruption, financial\ncorruption, police corruption, academic corruption and so on. The\ncausal theory of corruption is a sustained attempt to provide an\naccount which accommodates this diversity. In doing so it emphasizes\nthe causal as well as the normative dimension of institutional\ncorruption. The most influential contemporary philosophical theories\nof political corruption are those of Dennis Thompson and Lawrence\nLessig. Moreover, Lessig\u2019s notion of dependence corruptions\nlooks to be generalizable to a degree to institutions other than\npolitical institutions. Likewise the mechanism that lies at the heart\nof Thompson\u2019s theory may be generalizable to a degree to\ninstitutions other than political institutions. However, as they\nstand, neither of these theories provides a general or comprehensive\ntheory of institutional corruption (and Lessig\u2019s theory, at\nleast, is not intended to do so). The wide diversity of corrupt\nactions implies that there may well need to be a correspondingly wide\nand diverse range of specific anti-corruption measures to combat\ncorruption in its different forms, and indeed in its possibly very\ndifferent contexts. Recent decades have seen the rise of whole systems\nof anti-corruptions mechanisms encased in what are referred to as\nintegrity systems. Here we can distinguish reactive from preventive\nelements of an integrity or anti-corruption system and, arguably, an\neffective integrity system should integrate reactive and preventive\nelements in an overall holistic system.",
