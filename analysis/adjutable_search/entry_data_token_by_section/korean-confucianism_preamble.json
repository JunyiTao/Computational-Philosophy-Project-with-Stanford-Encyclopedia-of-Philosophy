    "main_text": "\n\nKoreans have been key players in Asian intellectual history and have\nhistorically been great propagators of intercultural adaptation. The\n\u201cThree Teachings\u201d of China, in the form of Buddhism,\nConfucianism, and Daoism (sometimes written \u201cTaoism\u201d), had\nall made their way into Korea by the fifth century CE, blending with\nthe pre-existing institutions and culture there. Korean Confucians had\nused Confucian ideas, especially those advocating hierarchy and moral\nleadership, to bolster a powerful state bureaucracy in order to\nprovide society with a rigidly structured and organised modus\nvivendi. In this context, philosophical thought was linked with\naction, and with concrete implications for oneself, one\u2019s\nfamily, and one\u2019s state (indeed, the world). Confucians, who\nwere not particularly concerned with the spiritual life of\nindividuals, sought an organised pathway to create an ethical and\nsocially guiding discourse. Inevitably, confrontations arose between\ndifferent groups, and intellectually, they gave rise to a series of\nphilosophical debates that have shaped Korean Confucianism, especially\nduring its phase of maturation during the Chos\u014fn dynasty\n(1392\u20131910), when its recalibrated form, Neo-Confucianism,\ndisplaced Buddhism as a rival intellectual and philosophical\nsystem.\n\nThe sections below will trace the main ideas and themes of Korean\nConfucianism, with in depth examinations of several philosophical\ndebates and key philosophical ideas, while underscoring one of the\nmore salient features of Korean Confucianism, sagehood, which has\npotential for our lives now in the twenty-first century.\n",
