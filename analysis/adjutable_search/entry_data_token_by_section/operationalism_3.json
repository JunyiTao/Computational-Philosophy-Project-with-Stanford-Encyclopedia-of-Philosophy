    "main_text": "Bridgman\u2019s ideas on operational analysis || Implications outside physics\n1.4 Implications outside physics\n\nBridgman also extended his operationalist thinking by considering its\nimplications outside physics. This was important to him at least from\nthe time of The Logic of Modern Physics, in which he\nventured: \u201cmany of the questions asked about social and\nphilosophical subjects will be found to be meaningless when examined\nfrom the point of operations. It would doubtless conduce greatly to\nclarity of thought if the operational mode of thinking were adopted in\nall fields of inquiry as well as in the physical\u201d (30\u201332).\nTo Bridgman it was clear that \u201cto adopt the operational point of\nview \u2026 means a far-reaching change in all our habits of\nthought\u201d. He knew that in practice this would be a very\ndifficult thing to do: \u201cOperational thinking will at first prove\nto be an unsocial virtue; one will find oneself perpetually unable to\nunderstand the simplest conversation of one\u2019s friends, and will\nmake oneself universally unpopular by demanding the meaning of\napparently the simplest terms of every argument\u201d. Perhaps this\nthrowaway remark was a sign of things to come, as Bridgman would in\nthe end find himself rather isolated and plagued by misunderstanding,\neven among those who found his philosophical ideas worth discussing,\nas we will see in Section 2.\n\nBridgman did not develop in detail his operationalist ideas in\nrelation to any other science than physics, apparently content to\nleave that job to the specialists in the respective fields. Some other\nscientists and philosophers did take up Bridgman\u2019s call for\noperationalist reforms, with interesting consequences. Now, it would\nbe fair to say that operationalism did not change the practice of\nphysics itself drastically from what it would have been anyway, and\nmost physicists followed him only as far as he asserted what was\ncommon sense to them. The situation was perhaps similar in other\nphysical sciences, too. For example, operational thinking has always\nbeen an important part of chemistry, sometimes explicitly so, for\nexample in Lavoisier\u2019s famous \u201coperational\u201d\ndefinition of a chemical element as a substance that has not yet been\ndecomposed further. David Hull (1968) indicates that some key terms in\nbiology has been criticised for not being operational, and calls for a\nnuanced view on the matter. Hugh Petrie (1971) laments that a\npositivist dogma originating from a misunderstanding of operationalism\nhas had a negative influence on the social sciences. Moyer (1991,\n393\u2013394) records Bridgman\u2019s influence on the University of\nChicago economist Henry Schultz, and the strong and explicit\noperationalist orientation of Paul Samuelson\u2019s early work. Paul\nMarshall (1979) argues, with particular attention to political\nscience, that operationalism has left a methodological legacy in the\nsocial sciences lasting well beyond its decline within the philosophy\nof science.\n\nThe field that was most significantly and expressly affected by\noperationalism was psychology. Behaviorist psychologists took up\noperationalism (or operationism, as it was more often called\nin psychology) as a weapon in their fight against more traditional\npsychologists, especially those who prized introspection as the most\nimportant source of psychological knowledge. The Harvard psychologist\nEdwin Boring (1886\u20131968) saw Bridgman\u2019s philosophy as a\nmodern substitute for positivism, and he seems to have coined the term\n\u201coperationism\u201d (see Walter 1990, 178). It was\nBoring\u2019s student Stanley Smith Stevens (1906\u20131973) who was\nperhaps the most aggressive promoter of operationism in psychology\n(Hardcastle 1994; Feest 2005). Stevens saw operationism as a sure\nmethod of increasing rigor in psychological experiments and discourse,\nasserting that \u201cto experience is, for the purpose of science, to\nreact discriminately\u201d, since these reactions are what science\ncan measure and record publicly (quoted in Feest 2005, 136). Echoing\nBridgman\u2019s take on Einstein, Stevens declared in 1935:\n\u201cThe revolution that will put an end to the possibility of\nrevolutions is the one that defines a straightforward procedure for\nthe definition and validation of concepts. \u2026 Such a procedure\nis the one which tests the meaning of concepts by appealing to the\nconcrete operations by which the concept is determined. We may call it\noperationism\u201d (quoted in Walter 1990, 180).\n\nIn his concrete research in psychology Stevens focused on\npsychophysics, starting with his Ph.D. dissertation on the perceived\nattributes of tones, written under Boring\u2019s supervision. Another\nnotable operationist in psychology was Edward Chace Tolman\n(1886\u20131959), also a Harvard Ph.D., who taught for most of his\nlife at the University of California at Berkeley. Starting with his\nresearch on problem-solving behavior in rats, Tolman gave an\noperational treatment of desire, for example operationalizing hunger\nin terms of \u201ctime since last feeding\u201d. Tolman did not deny\nthat hunger was a subjective feeling, nor was it the main object of\nhis research, but insisted that controlling for degrees of hunger in\nhis experiments required tractable operations that would allow\nscientists to get a hold on something related to that subjective\nexperience (see Feest 2005, 136\u2013138). In Gustav Bergmann\u2019s\nassessment, operationism helped behaviorism to move from its initial\nmetaphysical Watsonian variety to its modern version (Bergmann in\nFrank 1956, 53).\n\nDespite the strong popularity of operationist behaviorism in certain\nquarters, it never commanded a complete consensus even in American\npsychology. Perhaps the most unexpected opposition came from Bridgman\nhimself. Behaviorists were wanting to use operations to attain\nobjectivity in psychology, which for them meant taking psychological\ndiscourse away from attempts to describe private experience. This was\njust the wrong move in Bridgman\u2019s view, as we will see in more\ndetail in Section 2.4 below. Bridgman engaged in some discussion with\nStevens but discovered that the latter\u2019s enthusiasm for\n\u201coperational ideas\u201d was really for something that he could\nnot agree with. By 1936 he declared privately: \u201cI have rather\nwashed my hands of him\u201d (quoted in Walter 1990, 184).\nBridgman\u2019s disagreement with B. F. Skinner (1904\u20131990) was\neven more severe, and resulted in a prolonged dispute between the two\n(Holton 2005; Walter 1990, 188\u2013192). Operationism became a\nsubject of great controversy in psychology, epitomized in a 1945\nspecial issue of the Psychological Review devoted to a\nsymposium on operationism suggested by Boring, who remained supportive\nof the movement at some critical distance.\n\nUljana Feest considers that operationism did leave a lasting and\npositive legacy in psychology. The maxim of operationism dictates that\npsychologists should provide concepts with operational definitions by\nspecifying paradigmatic experimental conditions for their application,\nand this remains a useful methodological tenet (Feest 2011, 403). In\nFeest\u2019s view a sufficiently sophisticated understanding of\noperationism in psychology was only reached by the second generation\nof operationists, who consciously employed what she calls the\nmethodological (rather than positivist) reading of operationism.\nFeest\u2019s analysis reinforces R. C. Grace\u2019s (2001)\nview that the early operationist psychologists made the mistake of\nadopting a very restrictive version of Bridgman\u2019s ideas, but\nthat this mistake was corrected in the 1950s with the adoption of\n\u201cmultiple\u201d or \u201cconvergent\u201d operationism. These\nsophisticated operationists did not take operational definitions to\ngive full and fixed meanings of concepts, but used them as provisional\ntools aiding their scientific investigations. As Feest puts it:\n\u201cI believe that in offering operational definitions, scientists\nwere partially and temporarily specifying their usage of\ncertain concepts by saying which kinds of empirical indicators they\ntook to be indicative of the referents of the\nconcepts.\u201d(Feest 2005, 133; emphases original)\n",
