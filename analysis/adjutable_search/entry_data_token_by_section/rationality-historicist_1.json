    "main_text": "Historicist Conceptions of Rationality: The Battle of the Big Systems || The Historical Turn in Philosophy of Science\n1.2 The Historical Turn in Philosophy of Science\n\nKuhn\u2019s Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962/1970a)\nwas the original manifesto of historicist philosophy of science and\nremains the primary reference point. His work thus provides the most\nuseful platform for recounting early historicist efforts\u2014and the\ndifficulties they faced. We shall then take a briefer look at other\nmajor contributors. Kuhn had been anticipated in quite diverse ways by\nKant, Hegel, William Whewell, \u00c9mile Meyerson, Ernst Cassirer,\nAlexandre Koyr\u00e9, Philipp Frank, Gaston Bachelard, Ludwik Fleck,\nHans Reichenbach, Rudolf Carnap, W.V. Quine, Michael Polanyi, Hesse,\nToulmin, and Hanson and was immediately followed by Lakatos,\nFeyerabend, Shapere, Laudan, and others (see the entry on\n Thomas Kuhn;\n also Hoyningen-Huene [1989] 1993 and Rheinberger [2007] 2010b).\n\nThe famous opening sentence of Structure was:\n\n\nHistory, if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or\nchronology, could produce a decisive transformation in the image of\nscience by which we are now possessed. That image has previously been\ndrawn, even by scientists themselves, mainly from the study of\nfinished scientific achievements as these are recorded in the classics\nand, more recently, in the textbooks from which each new scientific\ngeneration learns to practice its trade. Inevitably, however, the aim\nof such books is persuasive and pedagogic; a concept of science drawn\nfrom them is no more likely to fit the enterprise that produced them\nthan an image of a national culture drawn from a tourist brochure or a\nlanguage text. This essay attempts to show that we have been misled by\nthem in fundamental ways. Its aim is a sketch of the quite different\nconcept of science that can emerge from the historical records of the\nresearch activity itself.\n\n\nKuhn modeled the history of a science as a succession of dogmatic\nperiods of \u201cnormal science\u201d under a\n\u201cparadigm\u201d, separated by \u201crevolutionary\u201d\ntransitions to the next paradigm. According to Kuhn such a break from\nthe past rejuvenates a field that had stagnated under the weight of\nanomalies that it no longer seemed to have the resources to solve. A\nnew paradigm introduces changes at all levels, from established\ndatabases and instrumentation to the conceptual framework, goals,\nstandards, institutional organization, and research culture\u2014so\nmuch so that some older practitioners can hardly recognize the new\nparadigm as their field. This disconnect produces\n\u201cincommensurability\u201d across paradigm change, ranging from\ncommunication failure to problems of rational choice between the two,\nsince there exists no fixed measure of success. At his most radical,\nKuhn modeled revolutionary decisions on political revolution at the\ncommunity level and on religious conversion at the individual level,\nadding that scientists on different sides of a paradigm debate\n\u201clive in different worlds\u201d ([1962] 1970a: ch. 10). Under\ncritical pressure, he subsequently softened his position. In fact, he sought\nto clarify the notion of incommensurability to the end of his life\n(Sankey 1997). Kuhn exemplifies the irony that, while historicists\nused deep change as a weapon to beat up traditionalists, it presented\nserious problems for the historicists themselves as well.\n\nKuhn\u2019s book was his attempt to answer the question posed by the\nabove quotation. This question immediately raised another: How can\nappeal to history achieve that transformative change? In particular,\nhow can descriptive claims about the past (or present\nscience, for that matter) affect our normative judgments\nabout rational beliefs and behaviors? How can history inform a\nmethodology of science? This is a version of the so-called\n\u201cis-ought\u201d problem. Can there really be a\n\u201cjudgment\u201d of history?\n\nOver the next decade or two, most philosophers of science came to\nagree that there was a disconnect between science as historically\npracticed and the normative models of the received philosophers. The\nhistoricists therefore presented the philosophical community with a\nmomentous dilemma: either reject most of science to date as irrational\nor else accept that science is generally rational and use the\nhistorical information to revise our deeply entrenched logical and\nprobabilistic conception of rationality. Some positivists and Popperians\nattempted to finesse option one by arguing that the history of science\napproximated the traditional view of rationality closely enough if we\ntreated their sanitized, abstract models of science as regulative\nideals. Kuhn and other historicists defended option two, taking the\nrationality of science to be practically axiomatic. Wrote Kuhn,\n\n\nI do not for a moment believe that science is an intrinsically\nirrational enterprise \u2026. I take this assertion not as a matter\nof fact, but rather of principle. Scientific behavior, taken as a\nwhole, is the best example we have of rationality. (1971: 143f; quoted\nby Hoyningen-Huhne [1989] 1993: 251f.)\n\n\nWhat was Kuhn\u2019s revised conception of rationality and how was it\nbased on history (to the degree that it was)? While he provided no\nexplicit, general theory of rationality, Kuhn\u2019s challenge here\nwas greater than many appreciate. The positivists and Popperians had\npractically invented modern, academic philosophy of science. For them,\nscientific rationality was wholly a matter of making correct theory\nacceptance decisions in context of justification, where the hypotheses\nand test data are already on the table, the data are theory-neutral,\nand the goals and standards are logically independent of theory. To\nKuhn this picture of science was more like a photographic negative in\nwhich light and dark are reversed. Let us count the ways.\n\n(1) Although his work deepened the problem of underdetermination by\ninsisting that logic plus data is insufficient to determine theory\nchoice, Kuhn reduced the magnitude of the problem of justifying\nscientific claims by rejecting traditional realism and the\ncorrespondence theory of truth. No longer must scientists justify a\ntheoretical claim as true. Instead, he adopted the Kantian critical\nposition that no enterprise, including science, has the ability to\nestablish the final, metaphysical truth about the world. Instead,\nscience is largely a problem-solving enterprise, and scientists\nare in position to evaluate the goodness of proposed problem\nsolutions, relative to previous attempts. \u201c[T]he unit of\nscientific achievement is the solved problem\u201d ([1962] 1970a:\n169). What demarcates science from nonscience and pseudoscience is\nsustained support (over historical time) of a puzzle-solving\ntradition, not the application of a nonexistent \u201cscientific\nmethod\u201d to determine whether the claims are true or false or\nprobable to some degree. With justified truth claims gone, new\naccounts of scientific discovery, knowledge, explanation, and progress\nwill also be needed.\n\n(2) Contrary to most empiricist views, the data are not\ntheory-neutral, hence not cumulative from one period of science to\nanother. \n\n(3) Moreover, Kuhn extended the claim that observation is theory laden\nto say that all major aspects of a science are laden by the\nothers. Substantive data and theoretical claims, methodological\nstandards, goals, and even the social institutions of science are all\nbound up in mutual dependence. (The received view had kept them\nseparate and independent in order to avoid mutual contamination\nallegedly leading to circularity; see Scheffler 1967.) It is this\ninternal feedback that introduces the interesting, nonlinear dynamics\ninto Kuhn\u2019s model, since the feedback produces coupled\ninteraction terms (Kuhn 1977: 336; Nickles 2013b; De Langhe\n2014b).\n\n(4) This tight coherence implies that normal science is conservative\nand closed, in contrast to Popper\u2019s science as an \u201copen\nsociety\u201d (Popper 1945). Contrary to tradition, said Kuhn,\nscientific rationality does not consist in advancing hypotheses and\ntesting them severely. To challenge the constitutive pillars of a\nscientific field, as Popper and the positivists advocated, would\ndestroy it, for all theories and conceptual frameworks face\npotentially falsifying anomalies at all times (Kuhn [1962] 1970a and\n1970b; Lakatos 1970 agreed). Popper\u2019s \u201ccritical\nrationalism\u201d, the key to Popper\u2019s Enlightenment conception\nof political democracy as well as scientific advance, is actually\nirrational; for such criticism would undercut the\nresearchers\u2019 reason for being.\n\n(5) Kuhn claimed that Popper and others had missed the existence of\nkey structures in the history of science\u2014the longer-term\napproaches that he called paradigms and hence both normal and truly\nrevolutionary science. There are different historical scales in play:\nindividual theories, paradigms, and the still longer-term perspective\nof a succession of paradigms. So Kuhn adopted a two-tiered or\ndouble-process conception of science in which there is, first, a\nconstitutive framework (the paradigm), held immune to revision during\nperiods of normal science, and, second, change from one framework to\nanother. For these frameworks are historically contingent and are\neventually displaced by others. Kuhn\u2019s two-process account\nsharply clashed with the one-process account of Popper (1963) and many\nothers. Ironically, given that Kuhn was also attacking positivist\npositions, and given his greater sympathy for Popper, the two-process\naccount was closer to the \u201cpositivists\u201d Reichenbach and\nCarnap than to Popper (see Reisch 1991; Carnap 1950; De Langhe\n2014a,b; Nickles 2013a).\n\n(6) Thus two different accounts of scientific rationality are\nrequired, not one: one to cover the relatively smooth change within\nnormal science under a single paradigm and the other to handle radical\nparadigm change. This immediately implies that there are two basic\ntypes of scientific change, hence two problems of scientific change\nand/or two problems of progress to be solved, hence two accounts of\nscientific rationality needed to solve them. What were Kuhn\u2019s\nconstructive claims?\n\n(7) We should seek neither a single, neutral method of all science at\nall times nor an account based on explicit methodological rules. Most\nnormal scientific decisions are based on skilled judgments, not rules\n(Kuhn [1962] 1970a: chs. 5, 10). The appearance of rules in scientific\npractice is a sign of crisis, of breakdown. Contrary to tradition,\nneither rationality within a paradigm nor rational choice between\nparadigms is a matter of following rules. It is not the application of\na formal, logic- or probability-based algorithm. In both cases it is a\nmatter of skilled judgment (of different kinds).\n\n(8) Informal scientific judgment depends heavily upon rhetoric and\njudgments of heuristic fertility in the context of discovery\u2014the\nvery items that had been expressly excluded from the context of\nrational justification by the dominant tradition. For Kuhn, normal\nproblem solving is a matter of modeling new puzzles solutions on\nestablished precedents, the exemplars, where modeling crucially\ninvolves judgments of similarity, analogy, or metaphor. (Whereas\nPopper\u2019s methodology is a learning theory in which we learn only\nfrom our mistakes, in Kuhn\u2019s we learn also (mainly) from our\nsuccesses\u2014the exemplars, which, over time ratchet up our\nknowledge within normal science.) In paradigm change, the rhetorical\ntropes used in persuasion are typically more abstract and tenuous than\nin normal science. Kuhn\u2019s account of the rational acceptance of\nparadigm change had to remain thin because of incommensurability. Here\nthe justification problem was all the more difficult because new\nparadigms generally lose some of the successes of their predecessors\n(so called \u201cKuhn loss\u201d of problem solutions but also data,\ntheory, goals, and standards).\n\n(9) Kuhn\u2019s novel constructive move in dealing with the\nrationality of paradigm change was to bring in a prospective dimension\nof heuristic fertility judgments. From the point of view of key,\ncreative scientists, the old paradigm has exhausted its resources,\nwhereas radical new ideas and practices can not only resolve some old\nanomalies (retrospective confirmation) but, equally importantly, can\nreinvent and thereby preserve the field by opening up new frontiers\nwith much interesting new work to be done. For them the field now had\na future. To be sure, heuristic guidance was also a feature of normal\nscience, but there it was built in implicitly.\n\nIn sum, Kuhn turned the traditional ideas of scientific justification,\nbased on the discovery-justification-context distinction, on their\nhead. Ironically, once we take the research scientists\u2019 points\nof view, the more interesting forms of scientific cognition, including\njustification, occur in contexts of discovery. All of this according to Kuhn.\n\nCritics countered that, while the historicist upstarts had scored some\ndamaging critical points, their positive accounts of scientific\nrationality were underdeveloped, vague, and unconvincing. Political\nrevolution and religious conversion as models of rational\nbehavior?! Clark Glymour (1980: 7, 96ff) called the new approach\n\u201cthe new fuzziness\u201d. Could intuitive judgment really\nreplace standard confirmation theory? And what would be the analogous\nrelation of evidence to theory at the metamethodological level, where\nnow \u201ctheory\u201d was the set of methodological rules or theory\nof rationality itself? (Historicists replied that it is not their fault\nif real-life decision-making is a messy business that often outruns\navailable formal rules.) Shapere (1984: chs. 3\u20135) was a severe\nearly critic of Kuhn, and Lakatos (1970: 178) reported that Kuhn had\nreplaced rationality with \u201cmob rule\u201d. Since Shapere and\nLakatos were historicists, we see that the historicists could disagree\nsharply among themselves. Feyerabend will provide the most vivid\nexample.\n\nKuhn\u2019s insightful treatment of science from the working\nscientists\u2019 point of view provided a microlevel conception of\nrational decision-making. But did he have a metamethodological account\nof how to decide among competing theories of scientific rationality?\nAgain, not an explicit and comprehensive account, only some\nconstructive suggestions. Like all historicists, he said that a\nrationality theory must fit the history of science and that the\ntraditional accounts failed this history test. An adequate theory must\nalso be progressive and avoid epistemological relativism. Kuhn (and\nmany others) simply built in these norms from the outset. Such a move\nworks well among most friends of historicism but not well for critics,\nwho think these presuppositions simply beg the normativity of history\nquestion. Given incommensurability, are not rationality,\nprogressiveness, and denial of relativism key items that must be\nargued for? In other passages, Kuhn did argue for them, but few\ncritics were convinced.\n\nOn the positive side, Kuhn made an epistemological economy claim. \n\n\n[I]n its normal state \u2026 a scientific community is an immensely\nefficient instrument for solving the problems or puzzles that its\nparadigms define. ([1962] 1970a: 166; cf. Wray 2011: ch. 7) \n\n\nIt is clear that Kuhn considered science more\nefficient on his own account than on Popper\u2019s, because the double process enables\nextreme specialization (Wray 2011; De Langhe 2014c). Indeed,\ntraditional accounts fail Kuhn\u2019s demarcation\ncriterion\u2014that a genuine science supports a puzzle-solving\ntradition. Given Kuhn\u2019s conviction that science is progressive\nin terms of problem-solving success, predictive accuracy, simplicity\n(the reworking and streamlining of problem-solving efficiency over\ntime), and so on, it supposedly follows that his account makes science\nboth rational and non-relativistic. Critics disagreed.\n\nThere also seems to be a kind of transcendental argument strategy\nbehind Kuhn\u2019s approach, as a response to the quasi-Kantian\nquestion: Given that science, as historically practiced, is\nlargely rational and progressive, but not in the standard way, how are\nits rationality and progress possible? Supposedly, the study of the\nhistorical patterns will show the way.\n\nKuhn often described his two-process view as \u201cKant with moveable\ncategories\u201d. Accordingly, there is also a dialectical,\nquasi-Hegelian reading: from the myriad of micro-decisions by the\ncommunity of scientists in a given field over time, with lots of fits\nand starts, a progressive enterprise emerges, although not one that is\nteleologically converging on the metaphysical truth about the universe\nor on any other \u201cend\u201d. However, on this view we have\nabandoned the idea that individual scientific decisions are typically\ndriven by an explicit concern for rationality. In several areas of\nphilosophy there are heated controversies about whether higher-order\nemergents have genuine causal power and hence genuine explanatory\nforce. To that degree, it remains unclear what role the desire to be\nrational plays, as opposed to more mundane motives. This problem\narises for other historicists as well, as David Hull will note. (See\nthe entries on\n mental causation\n and on\n internalist vs. externalist conceptions of epistemic justification.)\n\nOn rationality as socially emergent, we may jump ahead here to note that feminist\nphilosophers of science such as Helen Longino and Miriam Solomon have\ndefended scientific rationality as a socially emergent norm (Longino\n1990, 2001; Solomon\n2001). They thereby address the question of how a naturalistic,\nscience-as-practiced approach to scientific knowledge can nonetheless\nhave normative implications. However, they do not shy away from making\npolicy proposals for changing (improving) scientific\npractices and their supporting institutions. On their accounts, some\nother factors, such as political/ideological ones, also socially\nemerge and can have top-down causal efficacy on individual\npractitioners but without negating the agency and autonomy of those\nindividuals. Here familiar issues of \u201cmethodological\nindividualism\u201d come into play. (See the entries on\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science,\n feminist perspectives on science,\n feminist social epistemology,\n and\n feminist political philosophy.)\n\nThe vigorous attacks on Kuhn as a radical subjectivist and\nirrationalist who was undermining not only philosophy but the Western\nintellectual tradition now look exaggerated, but it is fair to say\nthat the five big problem-complexes of normativity, incommensurability\n(including meaning change), relativism, social knowledge, and deep but\nrational progressive change are extremely difficult and remain open to\ndebate today. For many philosophers of science, relativism is the big\nbugaboo that must be defeated at all costs. For them, any view that\nleads to even a moderate relativism is thereby reduced to absurdity.\nHistoricist philosophers have insisted on relativity to historical\ncontext but, with few exceptions, have made a sharp distinction\nbetween relativity and outright relativism. Some\ncritics have not found this distinction convincing (see the entry on\n relativism,\n Kindi & Arabatzis 2012 and Richards & Daston 2016).\n",
