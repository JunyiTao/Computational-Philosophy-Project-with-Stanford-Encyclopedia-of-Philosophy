    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\nThe philosophical debate about backward causation is relatively new.\nOnly little consideration of the problem can be found in the\nphilosophical literature before Michael Dummett and Anthony Flew\ninitiated their discussion in the mid 1950s. The reason for this is\ntwofold. No empirical phenomena seem to demand a notion of backward\ncausation for our understanding of them. And for a long time it was\nthought that such a notion involved either a contradiction in terms or\na conceptual impossibility. David Hume\u2019s definition of the cause\nas the one of two events that happens before the other thus rules out\nthat the cause can happen after its effect. Moreover, according to\nKant\u2019s idea of synthetic a priori truth the claim that\nthe cause temporally precedes its effect was considered to state such\na truth. In 1954 Michael Dummett and Anthony Flew had a discussion\nabout whether an effect can precede its cause. Dummett defended the\nidea whereas Flew argued that it involved contradictions in terms.\n\nTwo years later, Max Black (1956) presented an argument against\nbackward causation, which became known as the bilking argument, and\nlater attempts to meet the argument seemed to generate all kinds of\nparadoxes. Imagine \\(B\\) to be earlier than \\(A\\), and let \\(B\\) be\nthe alleged effect of \\(A\\). Thus, we assume that \\(A\\) causes \\(B\\),\neven though \\(A\\) is later than \\(B\\). The idea behind the bilking\nargument is that whenever \\(B\\) has occurred, it is possible, in\nprinciple, to intervene in the course of events and prohibit \\(A\\)\nfrom occurring. But if this is the case, \\(A\\) cannot be the cause of\n\\(B\\); hence, we cannot have backward causation. Since then\nphilosophers have debated the effectiveness of the bilking argument in\nparticular and, in general, the validity and the soundness of the\nconcept of backward causation.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, physicists began to discuss the possibilities\nof particles travelling with a speed greater than light, the so-called\ntachyons, and as a consequence a similar debate about paradoxes\ninvolving backward causation arose among them. In case superluminal\nparticles, like tachyons, exist and could be used to generate signals,\nit seemed possible to communicate with the past because tachyons going\nforward in time with respect to one set of reference frames would\nalways be seen as travelling backwards in time from another set of\nreference frames.\n\nNow and then physicists and philosophers also invoke backward\ncausation in order to explain some experimental and theoretical\nresults within quantum mechanics. For instance, this might be in\nconnection with understanding quantum entanglement after several\nexperiments have proven the violation of Bell\u2019s inequalities.\n",
