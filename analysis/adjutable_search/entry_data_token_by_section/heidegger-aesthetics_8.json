    "main_text": "Heidegger\u2019s Philosophical Critique of Aesthetics: Introduction || Phenomenology Against Aesthetic Subjectivism\n2.6 Phenomenology Against Aesthetic Subjectivism\n\n\nFollowing the phenomenological dictum that we should describe our\nexperience of art in a way that is not distorted by the presuppositions\nwe have inherited from the metaphysical tradition is easier said than\ndone, however, for at least two reasons. First, the\nsubject/object dichotomy is so deeply entrenched in our\nself-understanding that it has come to implicitly structure the\nfundamental aesthetic approach (as we have seen). Second, it is\nnot immediately clear where (let alone how) we should look to discover\nart in a non-aesthetic way. Indeed, it now seems natural for us\nto think that what makes our experience of art objects significant is\nthat such experiences allow us human subjects temporarily to transcend\nthe sphere of our own subjectivity by getting in touch with art objects\noutside ourselves, because these transcendent experiences can\nprofoundly enrich our subjective experience.\n\n\nIn Heidegger\u2019s view, however, this aesthetic perspective gets\nthe story backward. We do not begin confined to our subjective\nspheres, temporarily leave those spheres behind in order to experience\nart objects, only to return back to subjectivity once again, enriched\nby the \u201cbooty\u201d we have captured during our adventure in the\nexternal world of art objects (BT 89/SZ 62). The reverse is\ntrue: Human existence originally \u201cstands\noutside\u201d (ek-sistere) itself, integrally involved with\nthe world in terms of which we ordinarily make sense of\n ourselves.[22]\nWe do\noccasionally experience ourselves as subjects confronting objects (for\nexample, when we try to learn to draw or paint realistically, or when\nwe find ourselves standing befuddled before an art object), but the\nexperience of ourselves as subjects confronting objects is\ncomparatively infrequent and takes place on the background of a more\nbasic experience of ourselves as integrally involved with the world of\nour practical concerns, an experience of fundamental self/world\nintertwinement to which we always return.\n\n\n\u201cProximally and for the most part [or \u2018initially and\nusually,\u2018 zun\u00e4chst und zumeist],\u201d as Heidegger\nlikes to say, we do not stand apart from the entities that populate our\nworld, observing them dispassionately\u2014or even passionately,\nhoping to transcend an isolated subjective sphere which in fact we are\nusually already beyond. Why, then, should we privilege the\ndetached, subject/object framework that results from the breakdown of\nour engaged experience when we try to approach art\nphilosophically? We should not; trying to approach art while\nstaying within the aesthetic approach is like trying to learn what it\nis like to ride a bike by staring at a broken bicycle: It is so\nto privilege the detached perspective of the observer that the\nparticipatory perspective gets eclipsed and forgotten. In\nHeidegger\u2019s view, the phenomenologically faulty presuppositions\nof modern philosophy have misled aesthetics into looking for the work\nof art in the wrong place, at a derived rather than the basic level of\nhuman interaction with the world, and thus into mistaking an intense\nsubjective experience of an external object for an encounter with the\ntrue work of art.\n\n\nModern aesthetics presupposes the subject/object dichotomy and then\nproblematically tries to describe the subsequent interaction between\ntwo allegedly heterogeneous domains, instead of recognizing and seeking\nto describe the prior role works of art play in the background of our\neveryday worldly engagement, in which no such dichotomy can yet be\nfound. Heidegger\u2019s post-aesthetic thinking about the work\nof art will thus instead seek to describe the usually unnoticed way in\nwhich artworks can form and inform our basic historical sense of what\nis and what matters (as we saw in section 1.1). Heidegger\u2019s\nthinking about the formative role art can play in the background of our\nself-understanding is \u201cpost-aesthetic\u201d in that it seeks to\nget past the constitutive mistakes of aesthetics, but it might also be\ncharacterized as \u201cpre-aesthetic\u201d insofar as the way he\ntries to go beyond aesthetics is by getting back behind aesthetics in\norder to do justice to that more primordial level of existence\naesthetics overlooks. Indeed, although this initially sounds\nparadoxical, Heidegger suggests that the best way to get beyond\naesthetic experience is to transcend it from within (that is, to\nexperience the way a subject\u2019s experience of an aesthetic object\ncan lead beyond or beneath itself), as we will see when we turn to his\nphenomenological analysis of Van Gogh\u2019s painting.\n\n\nTo sum up, then, because aesthetics tries to describe artworks from\nthe perspective of a subject confronting an external art object, the\naesthetic approach begins always-already \u201ctoo late\u201d (BT\n249/SZ 207). Aesthetics looks for art in the wrong place (at a\nderivative rather than primordial level of human interaction with the\nworld), and what it finds there is not the true work of art.\nMisled by the presuppositions of modern philosophy, aesthetics\noverlooks that more primordial level of human existence where,\nHeidegger will argue, true art inconspicuously accomplishes its\nontologically-revolutionary work.\n",
