    "main_text": "Roles, the Self, and the Generalized Other\n3. Roles, the Self, and the Generalized Other\n\nOne of the most noteworthy features of Mead\u2019s account of the\nsignificant symbol is that it assumes that anticipatory experiences\nare fundamental to the development of language. We have the ability to\nplace ourselves in the positions of others\u2014that is, to\nanticipate their responses\u2014with regard to our linguistic\ngestures. This ability is also crucial for the development of the self\nand self-consciousness. For Mead, as for Hegel, the self is\nfundamentally social and cognitive. It should be distinguished from\nthe individual, who also has non-cognitive attributes. The self, then,\nis not identical to the individual and is linked to\nself-consciousness. It begins to develop when individuals interact\nwith others and play roles. What are roles? They are constellations of\nbehaviors that are responses to sets of behaviors of other human\nbeings. The notions of role-taking and role playing are familiar from\nsociological and social-psychological literature. For example, the\nchild plays at being a doctor by having another child play at being a\npatient. To play at being a doctor, however, requires being able to\nanticipate what a patient might say, and vice versa. Role playing\ninvolves taking the attitudes or perspectives of others. It is worth\nnoting in this context that while Mead studied physiological\npsychology, his work on role-taking can be viewed as combining\nfeatures of the work of the Scottish sympathy theorists (which James\nappealed to in The Principles of Psychology), with\nHegel\u2019s dialectic of self and other. As we will discover\nshortly, perspective-taking is associated not only with roles, but\nwith far more complex behaviors.\n\nFor Mead, if we were simply to take the roles of others, we would\nnever develop selves or self-consciousness. We would have a nascent\nform of self-consciousness that parallels the sort of reflexive\nawareness that is required for the use of significant symbols. A\nrole-taking (self) consciousness of this sort makes possible what\nmight be called a proto-self, but not a self, because it doesn\u2019t\nhave the complexity necessary to give rise to a self. How then does a\nself arise? Here Mead introduces his well-known neologism,\nthe generalized other. When children or adults take\nroles, they can be said to be playing these roles in dyads. However,\nthis sort of exchange is quite different from the more complex sets of\nbehaviors that are required to participate in games. In the latter, we\nare required to learn not only the responses of specific others, but\nbehaviors associated with every position on the field. These can be\ninternalized, and when we succeed in doing so we come to\n\u201cview\u201d our own behaviors from the perspective of the game\nas a whole, which is a system of organized actions.\n\nThe organized community or social group which gives to the individual\nhis unity of self may be called \u201cthe generalized other.\u201d\nThe attitude of the generalized other is the attitude of the whole\ncommunity. Thus, for example, in the case of such a social group as a\nball team, the team is the generalized other in so far as it\nenters\u2014as an organized process or social activity\u2014into the\nexperience of any one of the individual members of it. (MSS, 154)\n\n\nFor Mead, although these communities can take different forms, they\nshould be thought of as systems; for example, a family can be thought\nof systemically and can therefore give rise to a generalized other and\na self that corresponds to it. Generalized others can also be found\nin\n\nconcrete social classes or subgroups, such as political parties,\nclubs, corporations, which are all actually functional social units,\nin terms of which their individual members are directly related to one\nanother. The others are abstract social classes or subgroups, such as\nthe class of debtors and the class of creditors, in terms of which\ntheir individual members are related to one another only more or less\nindirectly. (MSS, 157)\n\n\nIn his Principles of Psychology, a book Mead knew well,\nWilliam James discusses various types of empirical selves, namely, the\nmaterial, the social, and the spiritual. In addressing the social\nself, James notes how it is possible to have multiple selves.\n\nProperly speaking, a man has as many social selves as there are\nindividuals who recognize him and carry an image of him in their\nmind. To wound any one of these his images is to wound him. But as the\nindividuals who carry the images fall naturally into classes, we may\npractically say that he has as many different social selves as there\nare distinct groups of persons about whose opinion he cares.\nHe generally shows a different side of himself to each of these\ndifferent groups. (James 1890, 294)\n\n\nFrom Mead\u2019s vantage point, James was on the right track.\nHowever, the notion of audience is left undeveloped in James, as is\nthe manner in which language is utilized in the genesis of the self\nand self-consciousness. For Mead, James\u2019s audiences should be\nthought of in terms of systemically organized groups, such as we find\nin certain games, which give rise to generalized others. Further, we\nneed an account of how we come to view ourselves from the perspective\nof these groups that goes beyond the concept of \u201csympathetic\nattachments.\u201d Such an account involves reflexivity, which\noriginates with the vocal gesture and is essential to taking roles and\nthe perspective of the generalized other. In addition, reflexivity\nhelps make possible the capacity to \u201csee\u201d ourselves from\never wider or more \u201cuniversal\u201d communities. Mead relates\nthe latter capacity to cosmopolitan political and cultural\norientations. It\u2019s worth noting that for Mead a full account of\nthe self should address the phylogenetic as well as the\nontogenetic.\n",
