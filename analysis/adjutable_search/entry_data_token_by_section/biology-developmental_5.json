    "main_text": "The Epistemological Organization of Developmental Biology || Erotetic Organization\n2.2 Erotetic Organization\n\nThe criterion of epistemic transparency\n (Section 2.1)\n encourages an exploration of our third interpretive option\u2014the\nlack of reference to theories should be taken at face value.\nDevelopmental biology is organized primarily by stable, broad domains\nof problems that correspond to abstract representations of major\nontogenetic processes (differentiation, pattern formation, growth, and\nmorphogenesis;\n Section 1.2).\n Yet how do we interpret the \u201ctheoretical\u201d aspects of\ndevelopmental biology (e.g., positional information models of pattern\nformation) and the utilization of theories from other domains (e.g.,\nbiochemistry)? One way is to distinguish between theory-informed\nscience\u2014using theoretical knowledge\u2014and theory-directed\nscience\u2014having a theory that directs inquiry and organizes\nknowledge (Waters 2007b); developmental biology is theory-informed but\nnot theory-directed. Theories need not be wholly absent from\ndevelopmental biology but\u2014when present\u2014they play roles\nvery different from standard philosophical expectations. Developmental\nbiology uses theoretical knowledge from biochemistry when appealing to\nmorphogen gradients to explain how segments are established or\nchemical thermodynamics when invoking reaction\u2013diffusion\nmechanisms to explain pigmentation patterns. It also uses theoretical\nknowledge derived from within developmental biology, such as\npositional information models. Different kinds of theory inform\ndevelopmental biology, but these do not organize research\u2014they\nare not necessary to structure the knowledge and direct investigative\nactivities. Developmental biologists are not focused on confirming and\nextending the theory of reaction\u2013diffusion mechanisms, nor are\nthey typically organizing their research around positional\n information.[6]\n This theoretical knowledge is used in building explanations but does\nnot provide rails of guidance for how to proceed in a research\nprogram. All sciences may use theoretical knowledge, but this is not\nthe same as all sciences having a theory providing direction and\norganization.\n\nWhy think that problems provide organizational architecture for the\nepistemology of developmental biology? They are a pervasive feature of\nits reasoning practices, illustrated in textbooks that capture\nsubstantial community consensus about standards of explanation,\nexperimental methods, essential concepts, and empirical content.\nUnlike evolutionary biology textbooks that discuss the theory of\nnatural selection or economics textbooks that talk about microeconomic\ntheory, an examination of several editions of major textbooks indicate\nthat developmental biology does not have similar kinds of\ntheories.\n\nJonathan Slack\u2019s Essential Developmental Biology (Slack\n2006, 2013) is organized around four main types of processes, also\ndescribed as clustered groups of problems, which occur during\nembryonic development: regional specification (pattern formation),\ncell differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth. These broad clusters\nare then fleshed out along a standard timeline of early development,\nhighlighting gametogenesis, fertilization, cleavage, gastrulation, and\naxis specification\n (see Section 1.2).\n Different experimental approaches (cell and molecular biology,\ndevelopmental genetics, and experimental embryology) are utilized in a\nspecific set of model organisms\n (see below, Section 4)\n to dissect the workings of these developmental phenomena. Subsequent\nchapters cover later aspects of development (e.g., organogenesis),\nwith different systems treated in depth by tissue layer,\ndifferentiation and growth, or in relation to evolutionary questions\n(see below,\n Section 5).\n Throughout this presentation, no specific theory, set of hypotheses,\nor dominant model is invoked to organize these different domains of\ninvestigation. Instead, broad clusters of questions that reflect\ngenerally delineated processes (differentiation, specification,\nmorphogenesis, and growth) set the agenda of research.\n\nScott Gilbert\u2019s Developmental Biology exhibits a\nsimilar pattern (Gilbert 2000 [2003, 2006, 2010]). Developmental\nbiology is constituted by two broad questions (\u201cHow does the\nfertilized egg give rise to the adult body? And how does that adult\nbody produce yet another body?\u201d), which can then be subdivided\ninto further categories, such as differentiation, morphogenesis,\ngrowth, reproduction, regeneration, evolution, and environmental\nregulation. These questions can be parsed more analytically in terms\nof five variables: abstraction, variety, connectivity, temporality,\nand spatial composition. The values given to these variables structure\nthe constellation of research questions within the broad problem\nagendas corresponding to generally delineated processes. For example,\nresearch questions oriented around events in zebrafish gastrulation\nare structured in a way that differs from the research questions\noriented around vertebrate neural crest cell migration because they\ninvolve different values for the five variables: abstraction\n(zebrafish vs. vertebrates), temporality (earlier vs. later), spatial\ncomposition (tissue layer interactions vs. a distinctive population of\ncells), variety (epiboly vs. epithelium to mesenchyme transition), and\nconnectivity (gut formation and endoderm vs. organogenesis and\nectoderm/mesoderm). These configurations can be adjusted readily in\nresponse to shifts in the values for different variables (Love\n 2014).[7]\n\nThis anatomy of problems, with explicit epistemological structure\nderived from different values for these variables, operates to\norganize the science of development. Investigators from different\ndisciplines can be working on the same problem but asking different\nquestions that require distinct but complementary methodological\nresources. Knowledge and inquiry in developmental biology are\nintricately organized, just not by a central theory or group of\nmodels, and this erotetic organization is epistemologically accessible\nto the participating scientists. While theoretical knowledge,\nespecially that drawn from molecular biological mechanisms (see the\nentry on\n molecular biology)\n and mathematical models (e.g., reaction\u2013diffusion models) is\nubiquitous (theory-informed), the clusters of problems that\nreappear across the textbooks and correspond to different types of\nprocesses provide the governing architecture (not\ntheory-directed), which can be characterized explicitly according\nto the variables described. Further analysis of this problem anatomy\nis possible, including how it is displayed in regular research\narticles and not just textbooks, as well as other areas of biology\n(see, e.g., Brigandt and Love 2012).\n",
