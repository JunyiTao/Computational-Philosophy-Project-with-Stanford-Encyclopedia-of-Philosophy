Reasons for Singular Propositions: The reduplication argument\n\nPeter Strawson's reduplication argument, developed in (1959,\n20\u201322), can be construed as an argument for singular\npropositions. Strawson used the argument to support the related thesis\nthat demonstrative identification is fundamental to our\nability to identify and hence refer to, in speech and thought,\nindividuals. Demonstrative identification of o is\nenabled by one sensibly discriminating o from other\nindividuals. So one can demonstratively identify only individuals that\none has perceived. But one can think about other individuals as\nwell. These further individuals, then, must be descriptively\nidentified. Individuals that one identifies demonstratively are\ndirectly identified and not identified in virtue of their satisfies\nqualities by which the agent conceives the object, as individuals\ndescriptively identified are. (This distinction is reminiscent of\nRussell's distinction between thought by acquaintance and thought by\ndescription. We compare Russell and Strawson in more detail below.)\nStrawson's notion of demonstrative identification is thus closely\nrelated to the notions of direct reference and singular\npropositions.\n\n\nA reduplication universe is one in which the same set of qualities are\ndistributed in the same pattern across two regions. There are both\ntemporal and spatial versions of reduplication. We shall focus on the\nspatial version, as Strawson does. Suppose that Sally lives in a\nreduplication universe. Sally is standing in front of Bill, thinking\nthat he has a stain on his shirt. In another region of the universe\nthere is a qualitatively identical set of circumstances. So, there is\nSally*, who is just like Sally, standing in front of Bill*, who is\njust like Bill, thinking that he has a stain on his shirt. For any\npurely qualitative condition Bill satisfies, Bill* satisfies it\ntoo. Nonetheless it seems highly intuitive that Sally is thinking\nabout Bill and not Bill* (and Sally* is thinking about Bill* and not\nBill); after all, it is Bill and not Bill* that she is standing in\nfront of and who is the obvious source of her judgment.\n\n\nSuppose that all forms of identification were descriptive, so that\nidentifying an object required qualitatively discerning it from all\nothers. Then, as Sally cannot discern Bill from Bill* in wholly\nqualitative terms, her thought is not determinately about Bill rather\nthan Bill*. But intuitively her thoughts are about Bill, in virtue of\nthe fact that she is in perceptual contact with Bill rather than\nBill*. This is even more clear when we consider Sally's thought about\nherself. When Sally says to herself, \u2018\u2018I am\nhungry\u2019\u2019, she is thinking of herself and not Sally*. But\nif her thought about herself were in terms of purely qualitative\nconditions, then she would be unable to think determinately of herself\ninstead of Sally*. So, she must be capable of an alternative form of\nthought and identification that is distinct from and does not\npresuppose descriptive identification. Call this form of\nidentification demonstrative identification.  We have argued\nthat it is distinct from and does not depend upon descriptive\nidentification.\n\n\nThe argument we have presented above presupposes that Sally and Sally*\nand Bill and Bill* are numerically distinct but qualitatively\nindiscernible pairs of objects. Although many find this to be a\ngenuine possibility, thanks in large part to Max Black (1952)\nand Robert Adams (1979), there is a long tradition that\nsubscribes to the Identity of Indiscernibles (PII), according to\nwhich, for any objects x and y, if, for every\nquality F, x is F if and only if y\nis F (i.e., if x and y are qualitatively\nindiscernible), then x=y. But the argument can be\ndeveloped in such a way that it does not presuppose the falsity of\nPII. Let there be a quality that Bill and Bill* lacks. Then the\ndistinctness of Bill from Bill* is consistent with PII. But now let\nSally (and thus Sally*) be unaware of Bill's (and Bill*'s)\ninstantiating that quality. As long as Bill and Bill* are\nqualitatively indiscernible as far as Sally is concerned and\nyet intuitively Sally is thinking of Bill and not Bill*, the above\nargument for the irreducibility of demonstrative identification to\ndescriptive identification goes through, even if it is not possible\nfor there to be distinct objects with all the same qualities.\n\n\nSo far we have argued that demonstrative identification is not\nreducible to descriptive identification. But Strawson makes the\nstronger claim that, in the reduplication universe, descriptive\nidentification depends on demonstrative identification. To get this\nstronger claim consider an object that Sally has never perceived but\ncan intuitively think about \u2014 say, Bill's mother. Strawson\nclaims that considering this case proves false the claim \u201cthat\nwhere the particular to be identified cannot be directly located\n[i.e., cannot be demonstratively identified because it cannot be\nperceptually discriminated], its identification must rest ultimately\non description in purely general [i.e., qualitative] terms\u201d\n(1959, 21). Bill's mother (call her Morgan) is\nqualitatively indiscernible from Bill*'s mother. So Sally is unable to\ndistinguish in purely qualitative terms Morgan from every other object\nin the universe. But intuitively she can nonetheless think of\nher. This is because Sally can demonstratively identify Bill and thus\nhave thoughts determinately about Bill as opposed to his qualitative\ntwin Bill* and then think of Morgan under the descriptive condition\nBill's mother. As Bill is directly given, this is a condition\nthat Morgan and not her qualitative twin Morgan* satisfies. Thus\nSally's ability to descriptively identify objects in the universe is\nultimately grounded in her ability to demonstrative identify some\nstock of objects, identifying other objects in virtue of the unique\nrelations they bear to members of that stock. Strawson argues that the\ngeneral way of relating objects one has not perceived to those\ndemonstratively identified is by way of spatio-temporal\nrelations. (See (1959, 22) in particular, but much of the discussion\nthat follows in chapter 1 is aimed at establishing the Kantian claim\nthat spatio-temporal relations are the privileged set of relations for\nenabling identification of particulars.)\n\n\nLet's grant that to have a thought determinately about an individual\nin a reduplication universe requires possessing an irreducible,\nfundamental form of demonstrative identification. What bearing does\nthat have on thought about individuals in nonreduplication universes\nand in particular thought about individuals in our universe, which we\ntake, rightly we can suppose, to be a nonreduplication\nuniverse. Although Strawson does not argue in this way, the following\nseems compelling. Grant that our universe is in fact not a\nreduplication universe. But it could have been. Had there been, in\nsome distant part of the universe, a qualitative duplicate of me and\nmy surroundings, my thought would not have taken a different form than\nit actually has. But the considerations above show that, had we been\nliving in a reduplication universe, then demonstrative identification\nwould have been irreducible and fundamental. But then it is actually\nirreducible and fundamental.\n\n\nWe end this section by briefly comparing Strawson's view with\nRussell's and the contemporary neo-Russellian's views. We have seen\nthat, for Russell, like Strawson, demonstrative identification plays a\ncrucial role, in the form of acquaintance. But unlike Strawson,\nRussell denies that we demonstratively identify extra-mental\nindividuals. Russell can deliver the intuitively correct results that\nSally's thoughts are determinately about Bill and not Bill*, even\nthough she is not, on Russell's view, able to demonstratively identify\nBill. This is because Sally can demonstratively identify her sense\ndata that are caused by Bill and not Bill*. On Russell's view, Sally\ndescriptively identifies even Bill, but the descriptive condition she\nemploys contains direct reference to her occurrent sense data. She is\nthus able to form a descriptive (although not purely qualitative)\ncondition that Bill satisfies and Bill* does not. For this reason,\nRussell is better able to handle the reduplication argument than the\nFregean.\n\n\nBoth Strawson and Russell claimed that thought about particulars is\nultimately grounded on direct reference. But they disagree about what\nwe can directly refer to, with Strawson claiming that it includes\nperceived objects in the external world and Russell that it only\nincludes mental particulars. It is important to note, however, that as\nfar as the reduplication argument is concerned, this difference is of\nlittle consequence. As long as there is a stock of individuals that\nare thought of directly and not in terms of purely qualitative\nconditions that can serve as the anchors in terms of which the\nqualitatively indiscernible objects can then be discerned, the\nintuition that Sally is thinking determinately of Bill and not Bill*\nis respected.\n Strawson maintained that an agent can demonstratively identify\nonly objects that she has perceived. Neo-Russellians typically go a\nstep further, claiming that an agent can think directly about objects\nshe has not perceived in virtue of standing in the appropriate\ncommunicative chains ending in the object. So, even though you have\nnever perceived Plato, we will safely suppose, you can nevertheless\nthink directly about Plato in virtue of your standing in a\ncommunicative chain that ultimately traces back to perceptions (on the\npart of other agents in the communicative chain) of Plato. (For a\nrepresentative of this view, see Bach's (1994, chapter 2).) Some\nneo-Russellians go even further and maintain that there needn't be any\nperceptual contact at all with an object to think about it\ndirectly. (See, for example, Kaplan 1975b, where he defends the thesis\nthat the dthat-operator can transform any designating expression into\na directly referential term, competence with which enables an agent to\nthink about the designation of the original term directly. Hence, Le\nVerrier was able to think about Neptune directly despite the lack of\nperceptual contact with the planet (we will suppose) in virtue of his\ncompetence with the expression \u2018dthat[the cause of the\nperturbations in Uranus's orbit]\u2019. See also Robin Jeshion's\n(2002) for a similar view, in that she too thinks perceptual contact\nwith an object is not necessary for thinking of that object directly,\nalthough she does not appeal to Kaplan's dthat-operator. (For more on\nthese topics, see the papers collected in Jeshion 2010.)\n\n\nWe thus have a spectrum of views that agree that there is direct\nreference to individual in thought and language but disagree about its\nscope, from Russell's restrictive view of direct reference, according\nto which an agent can only think directly about her occurrent sense\ndata, to the liberal view of direct reference held by Kaplan and\nJeshion, according to which objects that have never been perceived can\nbe thought about directly. All of these views respect the intuition\nthat Sally's thoughts are determinately about Bill and not\nBill*. Thus, while the reduplication argument makes a powerful case\nthat there is some direct reference and hence that singular\nproposition are necessary for an adequate account of reference to\nindividuals in thought and language, it does not settle the further\nissue of how much of our thought is direct and involves the grasping\nof singular propositions and what is thought by description. That is,\nwhile the reduplication argument might settle that there are singular\npropositions, we must appeal to different considerations, like those\ninvolved in the argument from indexicals and demonstratives, to\nresolve the further issue of what individuals can be constituents of\nsingular propositions and under what conditions.\n",
