    "main_text": "Methodological Naturalism || Synthetic A Priori Intuitions?\n2.3 Synthetic A Priori Intuitions?\nIt is worth noting that not all philosophers who advertise themselves as engaging in \u201cconceptual\nanalysis\u201d are committed to the idea that this involves analytic a priori knowledge. In many cases philosophers who describe themselves in this way go on to explain that in their view \u201cconceptual\nanalysis\u201d is a matter of articulating synthetic claims and assessing them against a posteriori evidence. A particularly clear version of this picture of conceptual analysis is offered by Robert Brandom (2001). Similarly, recent advocates of \u201cconceptual engineering\u201d are explicit that in their view \u201cconcepts\u201d embody substantial commitments which are open to criticism on a posteriori grounds (Cappelen 2018, Cappelen, Plunket and Burgess 2019). In the end, it is not clear what differentiates \u201cconceptual analysis\u201d in this sense from the a posteriori assessment of theories. In any case, this species of conceptual analysis seems perfectly consistent with methodological naturalism. (See also Goldman 2007.)\nOther philosophers are also explicit that \u201cconceptual\nanalysis\u201d issues in synthetic claims, but simultaneously regard\nit as a source of a priori knowledge (e.g. Jenkins 2008,\n2012). This combination of views is less straightforward. In\nparticular, it seems open to the traditional query: how is such\nsynthetic a priori knowledge possible? If some claim is not\nguaranteed by the structure of our concepts, but answers to the nature\nof the world, then how is it possible to know it without a\nposteriori evidence?\nYet other philosophers distance themselves from talk of conceptual\nanalysis, but even so feel that philosophical reflection is a source\nof synthetic a priori intuition (Sosa 1998, 2007). They too\nwould seem to face the traditional query of how synthetic a\npriori knowledge is possible.\nIn this context, Timothy Williamson has recently argued that the\ntraditional distinction between a priori and a\nposteriori knowledge is less than clear-cut, and in particular\nthat it breaks down in connection with the intuitions on which\nphilosophers rely. In Williamson\u2019s view, there is a distinctive\nphilosophical method in which intuitive judgements play a central\nrole, but there is no warrant for classifying the relevant intuitions\nas a priori rather than a posteriori (Williamson\n2013).\nHowever, it is arguable that this does not so much address as\nby-pass the underlying question. Perhaps philosophical intuitions are\nnot best classified as clearly \u201ca priori\u201d. But,\nif philosophy\u2019s distinctive methodology relies on synthetic\nintuitions, this still seems to call for some explanation of their reliability.\nDoubts about the reliability of philosophical intuitions have been\namplified over the past few years by the findings of\n\u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d. Empirical studies have\nindicated that many central philosophical intuitions are by no means\nuniversal, but rather peculiar to certain cultures, social classes and\ngenders (Knobe and Nichols 2008, 2017). This variability of intuitions is in\nobvious tension with their reliability. If different people have\nopposed philosophical intuitions, then it cannot be that intuitions of\nthis kind are always true.\nTimothy Williamson has responded to this challenge from\nexperimental philosophy by suggesting that, while the intuitions of\nordinary people on philosophical matters might be unreliable, those of\nphilosophers in particular can be trusted. In his view, a proper\nphilosophical training winnows out mistaken philosophical reactions\n(2007: 191; 2011).  However, this position still seems to call for a\npositive explanation of how synthetic philosophical knowledge might be\nestablished without a posteriori evidence, even if it is\nrestricted to trained philosophers.\nThe possibility of such an explanation is not of course to be\ndismissed out of hand. There is no contradiction in\nthe idea of experience-independent access to synthetic truths. After\nall, until the eighteenth century no modern philosopher doubted that\nGod had bestowed on us powers of reason that would enable us to\narrive at perception-independent knowledge of a range of synthetic\nclaims. Even if few contemporary philosophers would still appeal to\nGod in this context, there are other possible mechanisms that could\nplay an equivalent role.[13] It is not to be ruled out that our\nbiological heritage, for example, has fixed a range of beliefs in us\nwhose reliability owes nothing to our individual ontogenetic\nexperience.  Indeed there is a case for viewing certain aspects of\nour cultural heritage as playing a similar role, imbuing us with\ncertain beliefs whose justification rests on ancestral rather than\nindividual experience.[14]\nHowever, it is one thing to point to the general possibility of\nbiological and cultural mechanisms constituting\nexperience-independent sources of reliable knowledge, another to\nshow that such mechanisms operate within philosophy. Even if there\nare areas of thought which rest on such foundations, this does not\nshow that the intuitions of philosophers in particular have a\nsimilar backing. Moreover, there is arguably direct reason to doubt\nthat they do. It is not just the intuitions of everyday people on\nphilosophical matters that have a poor track record. The same applies\nto philosophers through history. It is not hard to think of\ndeep-seated intuitions appealed to by past philosophers that have\nsince been discredited. (A purely mechanical being cannot reason;\nspace must be Euclidean; an effect cannot be greater than its cause;\nevery event is determined; temporal succession cannot be relative.)\nIn the next section we will see that there is reason to suppose that\nthis unreliability is intrinsic to the nature of philosophy.\n",
