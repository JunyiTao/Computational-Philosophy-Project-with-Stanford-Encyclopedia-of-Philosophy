    "main_text": "Criteria: What Counts? || Force\n2.3 Force\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the law defines the crime of rape as comprising\ntwo separate elements: force and lack of consent. As West observes, in\nsuch jurisdictions\n\nsex that is undeniably forced is, nevertheless, not rape if\nthe victim \u201cconsented\u201d to it; and \u2026 sex that is\nundeniably nonconsensual is, nevertheless, not rape if there was no\nforce used to obtain it. (1996, 233)\n\n\nWest explains that, historically, rape law has seen two kinds of\nforced sex as consensual: first, the sex that a man forces on his wife\n(since she was thought to have \u201cconsented\u201d permanently and\nirrevocably to sex by getting married); and second, submission or\nacquiescence in the face of a show of force and/or a threat of more\nviolence to come. Furthermore, she points out, women are often\nportrayed in both pornographic and mainstream media as enjoying, and\n(the assumption is) therefore consenting to, forceful and even violent\nsex; such assumptions often derail rape cases, as when a defendant\nclaims that the encounter was simply \u201crough sex\u201d that was\nenjoyed by the victim. Underlying the inclusion of a nonconsent\nrequirement over and above the force requirement, according to West,\nis the view that \u201cwomen consent to forced sex all the\ntime\u2014so forced sex alone can\u2019t be rape\u201d (239). Cases\nof nonconsensual but unforced sex, on the other hand, include those in\nwhich the victim is induced to have sex through fraudulent\nmisrepresentation (for instance, a doctor telling her that sex with\nhim is necessary for her cure), and those in which she is coerced\nthrough nonviolent means (for instance, a professor telling her that\nshe must have sex with him to pass the course). The tendency of the\nlaw to see such encounters as meaningfully consensual departs\nstrikingly from how consent is understood in other areas; as West\nobserves, \u201cfraud or coercion that vitiates consent in\nnonsexual contexts constitutes either criminal or tortious\nactivity\u201d (240).\n\nMost feminists see the dual requirement of force and nonconsent as\nredundant at best and, at worst, as defining many rapes out of\nexistence. Feminists differ, however, as to how rape laws should\nideally be structured. Perhaps the most common view is that the force\nrequirement should be eliminated, and rape defined simply as\nnonconsensual sex, with differing degrees of severity depending on\nwhether and how much force and violence are employed (Estrich 1987).\nWhile some state statutes are now written this way, they often build\nphysical force into the definition of non-consent; thus in practice\nthey function very much like the dual requirement of force and\nnon-consent (Anderson 2005a, 630).\n\nAnother alternative is to eliminate the nonconsent requirement,\ndefining rape simply as forced sex. MacKinnon defends a variant of\nthis strategy, contending that \u201cRape should be defined as sex by\ncompulsion, of which physical force is one form. Lack of consent is\nredundant and should not be a separate element of the crime\u201d\n(1989, 245). This approach has the advantage of focusing on what the\nperpetrator did, rather than on how the victim responded (that is, on\nwhether her behavior constituted, or could reasonably have been seen\nby the perpetrator as constituting, consent).\n\nA third approach is to separate the two elements into two separate\ncrimes, one based on the use of force and the other on the lack of\nconsent. McGregor defends this idea, proposing that:\n\nIf either the offender engaged in sexual activity through the use of\nforce or he failed to secure meaningful consent, then [he] has\ncommitted an offense \u2026. Rather than requiring both conditions,\nas the current statutes do, or attempting to pack all cases into one\nor the other of the conjuncts \u2026 this approach recognizes that\nthere are at least two different offenses \u2026 for which there are\ndifferent conditions and different levels of seriousness. (1996, 190)\n\n\nSchulhofer (1998) argues, in a similar vein, that the law should\nrecognize two different offenses: sexual assault, which involves the\nuse of \u201cphysical force to compel another person to submit to an\nact of sexual penetration\u201d (283); and sexual abuse, a lesser\n(though still felonious) crime, which involves sexual penetration\nwithout the other person\u2019s affirmative and freely given consent.\nSome commentators have observed that developing such a lesser offense\nmay aid in winning convictions, as juries are reluctant to convict\nnonviolent offenders of rape. Anderson (2005a) criticizes this\napproach, however, pointing out that survivors of what she calls\n\u201call-American rape\u201d (nonconsensual sex without extrinsic\nforce or violence, usually committed by an acquaintance) suffer trauma\nat least as severe as do survivors of forceful rape. She contends that\n\u201call-American rape\u201d should retain the powerful label (and\npotentially severe penalty) of rape, while rapists who employ violence\nextrinsic to the rape itself should be charged with rape and\nother offenses (such as kidnapping or aggravated assault) as\nappropriate.\n",
