    "preamble": "\n\nIt is a truism that two speakers can say the same thing by uttering\ndifferent sentences, whether in the same or different languages. For\nexample, when a German speaker utters the sentence \u2018Schnee ist\nweiss\u2019 and an English speaker utters the sentence \u2018Snow is\nwhite\u2019, they have said the same thing by uttering the sentences\nthey did. Proponents of propositions hold that, speaking strictly,\nwhen speakers say the same thing by means of different declarative\nsentences, there is some (non-linguistic) thing, a proposition, that\neach has\n said.[1]\n This proposition is said to be expressed by both of the sentences\nuttered (taken in the contexts of utterance\u2014to accommodate\ncontextually sensitive expressions) by the speakers, and can be\nthought of as the information content of the sentences (taken in those\ncontexts). The proposition is taken to be the thing that is in the\nfirst instance true or false. A declarative sentence is true or false\nderivatively, in virtue of expressing (in the context in which it is\nuttered\u2014this contextual sensitivity shall henceforth be ignored\nand so qualifications of this sort dispensed with) a true or false\nproposition.\n\nPropositions are thought to perform a number of other functions in\naddition to being the bearers of truth and falsity and the things\nexpressed by declarative sentences. When a German and English speaker\nbelieve the same thing, say that the earth is round, the thing they\nboth believe is not a sentence but a proposition. For the English\nspeaker would express her belief by means of the sentence \u2018The\nearth is round\u2019 and the German speaker would express her belief\nby means of the different sentence \u2018Die Erde ist rund\u2019.\nThus when people believe, doubt and know things, it is propositions\nthat they bear these cognitive relations to. Finally, it is the\nproposition a sentence expresses, and not the sentence itself, that\npossesses modal properties such as being necessary, possible or\ncontingent.\n\nThat propositions perform these various functions is agreed upon by\nvirtually all advocates of\n propositions.[2]\n There is considerably less agreement concerning the nature of the\nthings, propositions, that perform these\n functions.[3]\n\nTo say that propositions are structured is to say something about the\nnature of propositions. Roughly, to say that propositions are\nstructured is to say that they are complex entities, entities having\nparts or constituents, where the constituents are bound together in a\ncertain way. Thus, particular accounts of structured propositions can\n(and do) differ in at least two ways: 1) they can differ as to what\nsorts of things are the constituents of structured propositions; and\n2) they can differ as to what binds these constituents together in a\nproposition. Various accounts of structured propositions that differ\nin these ways will be discussed below.\n\nPut this way, the view that propositions are structured is purely a\nmetaphysical thesis about what propositions are like and entails\nnothing about the relation between a sentence and the proposition it\nexpresses. But of course structured proposition theorists do have\nviews about the relation between a sentence and the proposition it\nexpresses.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Setting Up the Problems\n\nIntuitively, given that a sentence expresses a structured proposition,\nthe proposition will have parts or constituents that are the semantic\nvalues of words or subsentential complex linguistic expressions\noccurring in the sentence; and the proposition will have a structure\nsimilar to the structure of the sentence. For example, assuming that\nthe semantic value of a name is its bearer and that the semantic value\nof a transitive verb is a relation, a structured proposition theorist\nwill likely hold that the sentence\n\n(1) Jason loves\nPatty\n\n\nexpresses a proposition consisting of Jason, the loving relation and\nPatty, bound together in some way into a unity. Letting\n\u2018j\u2019 stand for Jason, \u2018p\u2019 for\nPatty and \u2018L\u2019 for the loving relation, we can\nrepresent the proposition in question as follows:\n\n(1a) [j[L[p]]]\n\n\nThus (1a)\u2019s structure is very close to that of (1); and (1a) has\nas constituents the semantic values of the words occurring in (1).\nIndeed, in the case of (1) and (1a), all and only semantic values of\nwords in the sentence are constituents of the proposition. But a given\naccount of structured propositions may not hold that this is the case\nin general for any one of at least three reasons. First, one might\nhold that certain words as they occur in phrases in sentences do not\ncontribute their semantic values to the propositions expressed by\nthose sentences because the semantic values of these words instead\npartially determine the semantic values of the phrases in which they\noccur, where these latter semantic values are contributed to the\nproposition. For example, one might hold that in the sentence\n\n(2) Colin is a tall\nyoung man.\n\n\nthe phrase \u2018is a tall young man\u2019 contributes to the\nproposition expressed by (2) the property of being a tall young man,\nwhich is its semantic value. Thus, though the semantic value of the\nword \u2018tall\u2019 partly determines the semantic value of the\nphrase \u2018is a tall young man\u2019, the proposition expressed by\n(2) contains no constituent that is the semantic value of the word\n\u2018tall\u2019 alone. Second, one might hold that a sentence may\nexpress a proposition (in a context), where the proposition has\nconstituents not contributed by any syntactic constituent of the\nsentence, let alone any word in the sentence. For example, Mark\nCrimmins [1992] claims that an utterance of the sentence\n\n(3) It\u2019s\nraining\n\n\nexpresses a proposition to the effect that it is raining at a\nparticular time and place. The present tense manages to somehow\ncontribute the time of utterance to the proposition. But no syntactic\nconstituent of the sentence contributes the place to the proposition,\nthough Crimmins claims it is a constituent of the proposition\n expressed.[4]\n Third, one might hold that certain words simply have no semantic\nvalues, and so make no contribution to propositions. So-called\nneoplanastic \u2018ne\u2019 in French might be thought to be an\nexample of this.\n\nBut even if, for one of the above reasons or some other reason, a\nsentence does not express a proposition whose constituents are\nprecisely the semantic values of words in the sentence, we can still\nsay that structured proposition theorists hold that sentences\nexpresses propositions, where many (and likely most) constituents of\nthe proposition are semantic values of words or phrases occurring in\nthe sentence. So in the case of (1) and (1a), the constituents of the\nproposition are precisely the semantic values of the words in (1). In\nthe case of (2) and (2a) (given the assumptions made above), the\nconstituents of (2a) are precisely the semantic values of the name\n\u2018Colin\u2019 and the verb phrase \u2018is a tall young\nman\u2019. And in the case of (3), the proposition it expresses has\nthree constituents, two of which are contributed by\n\u2018raining\u2019 and the present tense construction.\n\nThus, ignoring, or at least not dwelling on, the qualifications just\nmade, we can say that structured proposition theorists hold that\nsentences express propositions that are complex entities (most of)\nwhose constituents are the semantic values of expressions occurring in\nthe sentence, where these constituents are bound together by some\nstructure inducing bond that renders the structure of the proposition\nsimilar to the structure of the sentence expressing it.\n\nThis highlights an important feature of structured proposition\naccounts that distinguishes them from the other main competing account\nof propositions, namely the account of propositions as sets of\npossible worlds (to be discussed below). Because structured\npropositions have as parts the semantic values of expressions in the\nsentences expressing them, the semantic values of those expressions\nare recoverable from the semantic values of the sentences (i.e. the\npropositions).\n\nIt is perhaps worth noting that one could have a theory according to\nwhich the semantic values of expressions in a sentence are recoverable\nfrom the proposition expressed by the sentence, even though the\nsemantic values of the expressions are not (mereological or set\ntheoretic) parts of the proposition. For example, George Bealer [1993]\nformulates what he calls an algebraic conception of propositions (see\nalso Bealer [1982]). Bealer associates with each proposition a\n\u201cdecomposition tree.\u201d This decomposition tree shows how a\ngiven proposition is the result of the application of logical\noperations to individuals, properties, relations or other propositions\n(e.g. the application of the logical operation of negation to a\nproposition P yields a proposition that is true iff P is\nfalse; the application of the logical operation of singular\npredication to an item and a property yields a proposition that is\ntrue iff the item possesses the property, etc.). In general, a\nsentence will express a proposition such that the semantic values of\nexpressions in the sentence will occur on the decomposition tree\nassociated with the proposition. Thus, the semantic values of\nexpressions in a sentence will be recoverable from the proposition\n(together with its decomposition tree) expressed by the sentence.\nHowever, Bealer denies that these semantic values are in any sense\nset-theoretic members or mereological parts of the proposition. Bealer\nappears to hold that the proposition is metaphysically simple and has\nno parts at all. As the term is used here then, Bealer\u2019s is not\nan account of structured propositions for this reason. We will see\nbelow that others hold similar \u201calgebraic\u201d conceptions of\npropositions, where the propositions are complex entities consisting\nof constituents bound together in certain ways and so are structured\npropositions.\n\nSince the structured proposition expressed by a sentence has a\nstructure similar to that of the sentence and has as constituents\nsemantic values of expressions occurring in the sentence, the theory\nof structured propositions allows for distinct necessarily equivalent\npropositions. For example, the propositions expressed by\n\u2018Bachelors are unmarried\u2019 and \u2018Brothers are male\nsiblings\u2019 presumably are both necessarily true and hence are\nnecessarily equivalent. But clearly the propositions expressed by\nthese sentences have different constituents and so are distinct. The\nproposition expressed by the former presumably contains the semantic\nvalue of \u2018bachelor\u2019 (perhaps, the property of being a\nbachelor), whereas the proposition expressed by the latter\ndoesn\u2019t. And the proposition expressed by the latter contains\nthe semantic value of \u2018brother\u2019, whereas the proposition\nexpressed by the former doesn\u2019t. This is an important virtue of\nthe structured proposition view. The fact that it has this feature and\nthat its main competitor, the possible worlds account of propositions\n(discussed below), doesn\u2019t is one of the reasons many favor the\nstructured proposition view.\n\nIn discussing recent accounts of structured propositions below, it\nwill be shown how, on those accounts, sentences that are necessarily\nequivalent may express distinct propositions; and how the semantic\nvalues of expressions in a sentence are recoverable from the\nproposition expressed by the sentence.\n2. From Possible Worlds to Structured Propositions\n\nBecause the structured proposition view arose in large part due to\ndissatisfaction with the then prevailing view of propositions,\ndiscussing this other account of propositions will help to illuminate\nstructured proposition views. The late 1950s and 1960s saw the\ndevelopment of a new sort of model theory, \u201cpossible worlds\nsemantics\u201d, for systems of modal logic. In the framework of\npossible world semantics, linguistic expressions are assigned\nextensions \u201cat\u201d possible worlds. Thus, e.g. names, n-place\npredicates and sentences are assigned individuals, sets of\nn-tuples of individuals, and truth values, respectively, at\ndifferent possible worlds. Intuitively, possible worlds are to be\nthought of as \u201cways things could have been\u201d, and the\nassignment of (possibly different) extensions to expressions at\ndifferent possible worlds is part of capturing this intuition. Thus\nthere might have been more or fewer cows, and this is reflected in the\nfact that the extension of \u2018cow\u2019 (intuitively, the set of\nthings that are cows) can vary from possible world to possible\nworld.\n\nBecause we wish the extensions of expressions to vary from possible\nworld to possible world (at least in some cases), it is natural to\nassociate with each expression a function from possible worlds to\nextensions appropriate to that sort of expression. Thus we associate\nwith names, functions from possible worlds to individuals; with\nn-place predicates functions from possible worlds to sets of\nn-tuples; and with sentences, functions from possible worlds to\ntruth values. Such functions from possible worlds to extensions of the\nappropriate sort are often called intensions of the expressions in\nquestion, and the term \u2018intension\u2019 shall be used this way\nthroughout the present\n work.[5]\n Now since most think that the extensions of sentences are truth\nvalues, as indicated above, the intension of a sentence is a function\nfrom possible worlds to truth values. Intuitively, it maps a world to\ntrue if the sentence is true at that world. Thus the intension of a\nsentence can be seen as the primary bearer of truth and falsity at a\nworld: the sentence has the truth value it has at the world in virtue\nof its intension mapping that world to that truth value. Further,\nmodal operators were typically construed as operating on the\nintensions of the sentences they embed, and so those intensions could\nplausibly be thought of as possessing modal properties. Since\npropositions were traditionally held to be the primary bearers of\ntruth and falsity and the bearers of modal properties, it was natural\nfor possible world semanticists to identify propositions with\nfunctions from possible worlds to truth values (sentential\nintensions), or equivalently, sets of possible worlds (the set of\npossible worlds at which the sentence in question is true). Indeed,\nthis identification was thought by many to vindicate the previously\nmysterious notion of a\n proposition.[6]\n Possible worlds were apparently needed for the model theory of modal\nlogic anyway; why not build propositions out of them?\n\nCurrent structured proposition accounts arose largely out of\ndissatisfaction with the idea that propositions are sets of possible\nworlds (or functions from worlds to truth values). In fact, there were\nat least two quite distinct motivations for abandoning the view of\npropositions as sets of worlds and adopting the structured proposition\naccount.\n\nThe first had to do with the way propositions are individuated on a\npossible worlds account. The view that propositions are sets of\npossible worlds does not individuate propositions very finely. For\nexample, consider any pair of sentences that express metaphysically\nnecessary propositions, say \u2018Bachelors are unmarried\u2019 and\n\u2018Brothers are male siblings\u2019. Since these propositions are\ntrue in all possible worlds, each must be the set of all possible\nworlds. But there is only one such set. Thus there is only one such\nproposition! Hence these two sentences express the same proposition.\n(The view also predicts that all true sentences of mathematics express\nthe same (necessary) proposition, that any two necessarily equivalent\nsentences express the same proposition, that the conjunction of any\nsentence S with a necessarily true sentence expresses the same\nproposition as S, and so on.)\n\nThis should make clear that the account of propositions as sets of\nworlds is not a structured proposition account. For, as we saw, on a\nstructured proposition account, the semantic values of expressions in\na sentence are recoverable from the proposition expressed by the\nsentence, since those semantic values are constituents of the\nproposition. This is why on such an account, \u2018Bachelors are\nunmarried males\u2019 and \u2018Brothers are male siblings\u2019\nexpress distinct propositions: the propositions have different\nconstituents. But on the possible worlds account, the property of\nbeing a bachelor is in no sense recoverable from or a constituent of\nthe proposition expressed by \u2018Bachelors are unmarried\u2019.\nFor the latter proposition is just the set of all possible worlds. How\ncould the property of being a bachelor be \u201crecovered\u201d from\nthis set? Similarly, the property of being a brother is not\nrecoverable from the proposition expressed by \u2018Brothers are male\nsiblings.\u2019 Again, the latter proposition is just the set of all\npossible worlds.\n\nFurther, if propositions are sets of possible worlds, belief is\nconstrued as a relation between individuals and propositions and\nsentences of the form \u2018A believes that P\u2019\nassert that the individual A stands in the belief relation to\nthe proposition expressed by \u2018P\u2019, then for any\nnecessarily equivalent sentences \u2018P\u2019 and\n\u2018Q\u2019, \u2018A believes that P\u2019\nand \u2018A believes that Q\u2019 cannot differ in\ntruth value. This means that, for example, if \u2018A believes\nthat 1+1=2\u2019 is true, so is \u2018A believes that there\nis no greatest natural number\u2019. These consequences of the view\nthat propositions are sets of possible worlds were appreciated early\non; and theorists made a variety of attempts to make these\nconsequences seem less unpalatable. Despite these valiant efforts,\nmany philosophers viewed these consequences as a sign that there was\nsomething very wrong with the view that propositions are sets of\npossible worlds. Thus, philosophers were open to an account of\npropositions that individuated propositions more finely than the\npossible worlds account. As we have seen, the structured proposition\naccount is just such an account.\n\nIn order to make clear the second motivation for abandoning the view\nof propositions as sets of worlds and adopting the structured\nproposition account, we must discuss the notions of rigid designation\nand direct reference. A rigid designator is an expression that\ndesignates the same individual in all possible circumstances or\nworlds. In the early 1970\u2019s, Saul Kripke argued in Naming and\nNecessity that ordinary proper names are rigid designators. Kripke\nclaimed that when we consider a sentence containing an ordinary proper\nname, such as\n\nAristotle was a great philosopher\n\nand ask whether it would have been true or false in various\ncounterfactual circumstances, it is the properties of the very same\nman, Aristotle, in those circumstances that are relevant to the truth\nof the sentence. So, \u2018Aristotle\u2019 designates the same man\nin these various counterfactual circumstances; it is a rigid\ndesignator.\n\nAt around the same time, David Kaplan argued that indexicals (e.g.\n\u2018I\u2019, \u2018here\u2019, \u2018now\u2019) and\ndemonstratives (e.g. \u2018that\u2019, \u2018you\u2019,\n\u2018he\u2019) are directly referential. Concerning directly\nreferential expressions, Kaplan wrote:\n\nFor me, the intuitive idea is not that of an expression which turns\nout to designate the same object in all possible circumstances, but an\nexpression whose semantical rules provide directly that the referent\nin all possible circumstances is fixed to be the actual referent. In\ntypical cases the semantical rules will do this only implicitly, by\nproviding a way of determining the actual referent, and no way of\ndetermining any other propositional component. (Kaplan [1977] p. 493)\n\n\nThus, a directly referential expression is a rigid designator: its\nassociated semantic rules determine the actual referent of the\nexpression (in a context) and when evaluating what is said by the\nsentence containing the expression (in that context) in other possible\ncircumstances, this same referent is always relevant. To illustrate,\nif John utters\n\nI ski.\n\nat the present time and we want to evaluate whether what John said by\nmeans of that utterance is true or false in other possible\ncircumstances, it is John\u2019s properties in those other\ncircumstances that are relevant. Thus, \u2018I\u2019 is rigid: when\nevaluating the truth or falsity of what is said by an utterance of a\nsentence containing \u2018I\u2019 in counterfactual circumstances,\nit is the properties of the person whom \u2018I\u2019 referred to in\nthe utterance (the actual utterer) that are relevant.\n\nKaplan intended to contrast directly referential expressions with\nexpressions such as definite descriptions, which, though designating\nparticular individuals, do so by means of descriptive conditions being\nexpressed by the description and satisfied by the designated\nindividual. Thus Kaplan wrote that directly referential expressions\n\u201crefer directly without the mediation of Fregean Sinn as\nmeaning\u201d. (Kaplan [1977] p. 483) The designation of definite\ndescriptions is mediated by something like a Fregean sense (i.e. their\nassociated descriptive conditions).\n\nOf course, even if descriptions are not directly referential, some are\nrigid designators. For example, \u2018the successor of 1\u2019\ndesignates the same individual (2) in all possible worlds. So, though\nall directly referential expressions are rigid designators, some rigid\ndesignators are not directly referential. As was mentioned above, in a\npossible worlds semantics linguistic expressions are associated with\nintensions, functions from possible worlds to appropriate extensions.\nIn the case of expressions designating individuals, these intensions\nwill be functions from possible worlds to individuals. Note that all\nrigid designators (whether directly referential or not) will have\nintensions that are constant functions: they will be functions that\nmap all possible worlds to the same individual. Thus possible worlds\nsemantics tends to blur the distinction between directly referential\nexpressions and rigid non-directly referential expressions (e.g. rigid\ndefinite descriptions). To make the distinction between directly\nreferential expressions and rigid non-directly referential expressions\nmore vivid, Kaplan invoked the notion of structured propositions:\n\n\nIf I may wax metaphysical in order to fix an image, let us think of\nthe vehicles of evaluation\u2014the what-is-said in a given\ncontext\u2014as propositions. Don\u2019t think of propositions as\nsets of possible worlds, but rather as structured entities looking\nsomething like the sentences which express them. For each occurrence\nof a singular term in a sentence there will be a corresponding\nconstituent in the proposition expressed. The constituent of the\nproposition determines, for each circumstance of evaluation, the\nobject relevant to evaluating the proposition in that circumstance. In\ngeneral the constituent of the proposition will be some sort of\ncomplex, constructed from various attributes by logical composition.\nBut in the case of a singular term which is directly referential, the\nconstituent of the proposition is just the object itself. Thus it is\nthat it does not just turn out that the constituent determines the\nsame object in every circumstance, the constituent (corresponding to a\nrigid designator) just is the object. There is no determining to do at\nall. On this picture\u2014and this is really a picture and not a\ntheory\u2014the definite description\n\n(1) The n[(snow\nis slight & n2=9) \u2228 (~snow is slight &\n22=n+1)]\n\n\nwould yield a constituent which is complex although it would determine\nthe same object in all circumstances. Thus, (1), though a rigid\ndesignator, is not directly referential from this (metaphysical) point\nof view. (Kaplan [1977] p. 494\u2013495)\n\n\n(Kaplan goes on to attribute this \u201cmetaphysical picture\u201d\nof structured propositions to Russell.) Adopting this structured\nproposition account makes it simple to distinguish between directly\nreferential expressions and other expressions, rigid or not. Directly\nreferential expressions contribute their referents (in a context) to\nthe propositions expressed (in that context) by the sentences\ncontaining them. Non-directly referential expressions contribute some\ncomplex that may or may not determine the same individual in all\npossible circumstances. Thus the desire to distinguish clearly between\ndirectly referential expressions and other rigid designators prompted\nKaplan to re-introduce the Russellian notion of a structured\nproposition into the philosophical literature (see the discussion of\nRussell below). However, Kaplan [1977] tends to treat the notion of a\nstructured proposition as a heuristic device. He repeatedly calls it a\npicture, explicitly says that it is not part of his theory, and in his\nformal semantics he adopts the possible worlds account of propositions\n(contents of formulae), taking them to be functions from worlds (and\ntimes) to truth values.\n\nMany current direct reference theorists take the structured\nproposition account much more seriously. It is part of their theory in\nthe sense that when they say that an expression is directly\nreferential they are literally saying that it contributes its referent\nto propositions expressed by sentences containing it, (e.g. see the\ndiscussion of Salmon and Soames below).\n3. Some Recent Accounts of Structured Propositions\n\nHaving discussed structured proposition accounts in a general way, the\nbest way to further illuminate these accounts of propositions is to\ndiscuss some recent work on structured propositions. In so doing, we\nshall see various respects in which accounts of structured\npropositions can differ. Three caveats before proceeding. First, as\nwas mentioned above, structured proposition accounts, unlike possible\nworld accounts of propositions, allow for distinct necessarily\nequivalent propositions, and thus individuate propositions more finely\nthan possible worlds accounts. There are other accounts of\npropositions, or things that are intended to do the work of\npropositions, as in the previously mentioned example of Bealer [1993],\nthat are not structured proposition accounts (given the way that term\nis used here), but that allow for distinct necessarily equivalent\npropositions or things that are to do the work of propositions.\nAnother example is the interpreted logical form account defended by\nLarson and Ludlow [1993]. Though such accounts will not be discussed\nhere, the reader should be aware of them and that they are motivated\nby many of the considerations that motivate structured proposition\ntheorists. In particular, they attempt to individuate propositions (or\nthings that do the work of propositions) more finely than possible\nworlds accounts of propositions. Second, discussing a sampling of\nrecent work on the view that propositions are structured will not (and\nis not intended to) exhaust the versions of structured proposition\napproaches that there are. Rather, only some of the main issues and\ncurrent approaches will be highlighted. To that end, three broad\napproaches to structured propositions will be discussed; these are the\nNeo-Russellian Approach, the Structured Intensions Approach, and the\nAlgebraic Approach. In discussing each approach, a number of authors\nwho adopt the approach will be mentioned, but for definiteness, only a\nrepresentative of each approach will be highlighted in explaining it.\nThe reader should be aware that these groupings are somewhat loose,\nand that there may be important differences among authors who are\ngrouped together. Third, though questions will be raised here and\nthere, criticisms of the various approaches discussed will be left\naside. The task at hand is simply that of introducing the reader to\napproaches to structured propositions; criticizing the various\napproaches is a task for another day.\n3.1 The Neo-Russellian Approach\n\nIn a series of papers and a book, Scott Soames [1985, 1987, 1989] and\nNathan Salmon [1986a, 1986b, 1989a, 1989b] have laid out what is\nprobably the best known current theory of structured propositions.\nThere are some differences of detail between Salmon and Soames, but\nboth shall be treated here as holding the same view. Though some of\ntheir contributions will be discussed separately, the main account\nfollowed will be that laid out in Soames [1987].\n\nFirst, Soames [1985,1987] produced what many take to be a devastating\nattack on the view of propositions as sets of possible worlds. Soames\nshowed that even when one tries to get more fine-grained\npropositions-as-sets-of-worlds by allowing metaphysically impossible\nworlds (e.g. worlds in which George Bush is identical with Ronald\nReagan), inconsistent worlds (in which a thing can both possess and\nlack a property), and incomplete worlds (where some purported\n\u201cmatters of fact\u201d are simply not settled), the resulting\nview, when combined with other independently plausible assumptions, is\nriddled with overwhelming difficulties. These difficulties all stem\nfrom the fact, noted earlier, that on the worlds view, sentences with\nvery different syntactic structures and containing words with\ndifferent semantic values may express the same proposition. Soames\n[1987] concludes that we ought to give up the view that propositions\nare sets of worlds of any sort, and embrace an account of propositions\naccording to which propositions are structured entities, with\nindividuals, properties and relations as constituents. Soames called\nthese structured Russellian propositions. If the syntactic structures\nof sentences and the semantic values of words occurring in them are\nreflected in the structures and constituents of propositions they\nexpress, sentences with different syntactic structures and containing\nwords with different semantic values, whether true in all the same\nworlds or not, may express different propositions. It is perhaps worth\nnoting that having sentences with different syntactic structures and\ncontaining words with different semantic values express different\npropositions doesn\u2019t require one to hold that propositions\nthemselves are structured and contain the semantic values of the words\nas constituents. Still, it is a natural way of accounting for why\nsentences with different syntactic structures and containing words\nwith different semantic values that are true in all the same worlds\nexpress different propositions. Soames [1987] sketches a formal theory\nof structured propositions, including an assignment of structured\npropositions to the sentences of a simple formal language, and a\ndefinition of truth relative to a circumstance for structured\npropositions.\n\nSoames and Salmon are direct reference theorists, holding that names\n(as well as indexicals and demonstratives) have their referents as\ntheir semantic values and so contribute them to the propositions\nexpressed by sentences containing them. Further they hold that\npredicates and intransitive verbs have properties as their semantic\nvalues; and that transitive verbs have relations as their semantic\nvalues. Thus they hold that sentences such as\n\n(4) Scott\nruns.\n(5) Scott saw\nNathan.\n\n\nexpress the propositions\n\n(4a) <\u2009<\u2009o\u2009>,\nR\u2009>\n(5a) <\u2009<\u2009o,\no\u2032\u2009>, S\u2009>\n\n\nwhere o is Scott , o\u2032 is Nathan, R is the\nproperty of running, and S is the relation of seeing. The\nnegation of (4) expresses the proposition\n\n(4b) <\u2009NEG,\n<\u2009<\u2009o\u2009>,\nR\u2009>\u2009>\n\n\nwhere NEG is the truth function for negation. And the conjunction of\n(4) and (5) (in that order) expresses the proposition\n\n(5b) <\u2009CONJ<\u2009\n<\u2009<\u2009o\u2009>, R\u2009>,\n<\u2009<\u2009o, o\u2032\u2009>,\nS\u2009>\u2009>\u2009>\n\n\nwhere CONJ is the truth function for conjunction. Similar remarks\napply to sentences formed with other truth functional connectives.\nFurther a sentence such as\n\n(6) Something\nruns.\n\n\nexpresses the proposition\n\n(6a) <\u2009SOME,\ng\u2009>\n\n\nwhere SOME is the property of being a nonempty set and g is the\nfunction from individuals o\u2032 to the proposition\n<\u2009<\u2009o\u2032\u2009>,\nR\u2009>, (where, as before, R is the property of\nrunning).\n\nIt should be easy to imagine the definition of truth relative to a\ncircumstance for structured propositions of the sort mentioned above.\nFor example, (5a) will be true at a circumstance c iff\n<\u2009o, o\u2032\u2009> is in the extension\nof the relation S at c. (5b) will be true at c\niff CONJ maps the truth values of\n<\u2009<\u2009o\u2009>, R\u2009> and\n<\u2009<\u2009o, o\u2032\u2009>,\nS\u2009> at c to truth. And (6a) will be true at\nc iff there is an individual in c that g maps to\na proposition that is true in c, (in that case the set of\nindividuals in c that g maps to propositions true in\nc possesses SOME).\n\nIt should be clear that on this account of propositions sentences that\nare necessarily equivalent may express distinct propositions, and that\nthe semantic values of expressions in a sentence are recoverable from\nthe proposition it expresses. For example, \u2018All bachelors are\nunmarried\u2019 and \u2018All brother are male\u2019 are both true\nin all possible worlds. But on the present view, the former expresses\na proposition that has as a constituent a propositional function\nmapping an object to the proposition that that object is unmarried;\nthe latter does not. Further, e.g. the semantic value of\n\u2018runs\u2019 as it occurs in sentence (4) is recoverable from\nthe proposition (4) expresses in that it is a constituent of that\nproposition. Similar remarks apply to 5/5a and 6/6a (except that in 6a\nthe semantic value of \u2018runs\u2019 is encoded in g: that\nis, g maps individuals o to the proposition that\no runs, which in turn has the semantic value of\n\u2018runs\u2019 as a constituent).\n\nNote that this account of propositions (including the commitment to\nnames being directly referential) entails that sentences that differ\nonly with respect to coreferential names express the same proposition.\nThus\n\nMark Twain is Samuel Clemens.\n\nand\n\nSamuel Clemens is Samuel Clemens.\n\nexpress the same proposition on this view. Many have found this result\nincredible, since it would appear that the one sentence could be\ninformative and the other not. Salmon and Soames also hold that\n\u2018believes\u2019 expresses a relation between individuals and\npropositions, so that \u2018Scott believes that Mark Twain is Samuel\nClemens\u2019 expresses a proposition to the effect Scott stands in\nthe believes relation to the proposition expressed by \u2018Mark\nTwain is Samuel Clemens\u2019. But then it follows that \u2018Scott\nbelieves that Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens\u2019 and \u2018Scott\nbelieves that Samuel Clemens is Samuel Clemens\u2019 express the same\nproposition (since the embedded sentences in both belief ascriptions\nexpress the same proposition) and so cannot diverge in truth value.\nMany have found this consequence of the Salmon-Soames view of\npropositions (and belief ascriptions) hard to swallow as well.\n\nSalmon [1986] is largely an extended defense of these two consequences\nof the Salmon-Soames view. It is beyond the scope of the present work\nto explain Salmon\u2019s defense and the interested reader should\nconsult that work\n directly.[7]\n Soames [2002] deals with these issues, among others, as well.\n\nIn the formal semantics offered by Salmon and Soames, propositions are\nordered n-tuples (or concatenations of n-tuples), as are\n(4a), (5a), (5b) etc. above. But since Salmon and Soames say nothing\nexplicitly about the matter, it is unclear whether these\nn-tuples and concatenations merely represent propositions in\nthe formalism, or whether Soames and Salmon take them to be\npropositions. If the former, then the Salmon and Soames view is\nincomplete and we need to be told what propositions really are, and\nmore specifically what it is that really holds propositions together\n(i.e. what the corner brackets in (4a), (5a) etc. stand for). If the\nlatter, then the view at least seems to have trouble accounting for\nsome of the properties possessed by propositions. Propositions have\ntruth conditions: they are true or false, depending on how the world\nis. So if some ordered n-tuples are propositions, some ordered\nn-tuples have truth conditions. But ordered n-tuples\ndon\u2019t seem to be the kinds of things that have truth conditions.\nIndeed, presumably many ordered n-tuples have no truth\nconditions, (e.g. <\u20091,2,3\u2009>). So how/why did those\nn-tuples that are propositions come to have truth conditions?\nSimilar remarks apply to modal properties. Propositions are necessary,\ncontingent, and possible. These, again, don\u2019t seem to be\nproperties of n-tuples. Finally, if propositions are ordered\nn-tuples, that is, set theoretic constructions, it is hard to\nsee why a particular set theoretic construction is the proposition in\nquestion (and so has truth conditions, modal properties, etc.) as\nopposed to some other set theoretic construction that seems equally\nwell suited to the task. For example, we said that the sentence\n\n(4) Scott\nruns.\n\n\nexpresses the proposition/set theoretic construction\n\n(4a) <\u2009<\u2009o\u2009>,\nR\u2009>\n\n\nBut the following set theoretic construction seems equally suited to\nbe the proposition (4) expresses:\n\n(4b) <\u2009R,\n<\u2009o\u2009>\u2009>\n\n\nSo why it is that (4a), instead of (4b), is the proposition (4)\nexpresses, and has modal properties and truth conditions? \n\nThese questions as to what holds structured propositions together and\ngives them their structure, and how/why proposition have truth\nconditions turns us to other recent work within the neo-Russellian\napproach. While adopting more or less the same view as Salmon and\nSoames on the semantic values of different kind of words (though\nclaiming to be strictly neutral on the question of what the semantic\nvalues of names and predicates are), Jeffrey C. King [1995, 1996,\n2007, 2009] develops a view as to what binds the constituents of\npropositions together and how/why propositions have truth conditions.\nHe holds that propositions are not n-tuples and that a complex\nrelation binds together the constituents of a proposition and provides\nthe proposition with its\n structure.[8]\n Further, King is motivated by the idea that propositions cannot be\nthe kinds of things that by their very natures and independently of\nminds and languages have truth conditions. Hence, a radical feature of\nKing\u2019s view is that we speakers of natural languages endow\npropositions with their truth conditions, as a result of which he\ncalls his account a naturalized account of propositions.\n\nIn order to explain what complex relation King claims binds the\nconstituents together, consider the sentence \u2018Dara swims\u2019\nand, idealizing considerably for the sake of exposition, assume that\nits syntactic structure at LF is as follows:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nCall the syntactic relation between \u2018Dara\u2019 and\n\u2018swims\u2019 here R. King sometimes calls R the\nsentential relation of the sentence \u2018Dara swims\u2019. Among\nthe reasons that the English sentence in Figure 1 is true iff Dara\nswims is that the sentential relation R is interpreted by\nEnglish speakers in a certain way. We interpret it as\nascribing the semantic value of \u2018swims\u2019 to the\nsemantic value of \u2018Dara\u2019. As King points out, this is a\ncontingent matter. There might have been a language containing the\nsentence \u2018Dara swims\u2019 the speakers of which took the\nsentence to be true iff Dara fails to possess the property of\n swimming.[9]\n The difference in truth conditions of the sentence \u2018Dara\nswims\u2019 in these two languages is due to the speakers of the\nlanguages interpreting the syntactic concatenation in the sentence\ndifferently. And of course we English speakers interpreting R\nin the way we do (described above) is not an isolated matter. In\ngeneral we interpret syntactic concatenation by composing semantic\nvalues of the concatenated lexical items in certain\n ways.[10]\n King sometimes puts this by saying that we interpret syntactic\nconcatenation as instructing us to compose semantic values in certain\nways. The fact that R in Figure 1 is interpreted by English\nspeakers as ascribing the semantic value of \u2018swims\u2019 to the\nsemantic value of \u2018Dara\u2019 is expressed by saying that in\nEnglish, R encodes\n ascription.[11]\n It is the fact that R encodes ascription in English that makes\nthe English sentence \u2018Dara swims\u2019 have truth conditions\nrather than being a list of Dara and the property of\n swimming.[12]\n\nReturning to the main theme, we are trying to say what relation holds\ntogether Dara and the property of swimming in the proposition that\nDara swims on King\u2019s view. King claims that we ought to be sure\nthat we pick a relation such that there are good independent grounds\nfor thinking that Dara and the property really do stand in that\nrelation, so that the proposition in question exists. Given that\n\u2018Dara\u2019 has Dara as its semantic value and that\n\u2018swims\u2019 has the property of swimming as its semantic\nvalue, then in virtue of the existence of the English sentence\n\u2018Dara swims\u2019, here is a two-place relation that Dara and\nthe property of swimming stand in:\n\n(Relation)\n\nthere is a language L, a context c and lexical items a and b of L\nsuch that a and b occur at the left and right terminal nodes\n(respectively) of the sentential relation R that in L encodes\nascription and ___ is the semantic value of a in c and ___ is the\nsemantic value of b in c.\n\nFollowing King, let\u2019s call an object possessing a property, or\nn objects standing in an n-place relation, or an object\nstanding in a relation to a property, or n properties standing\nin an n-place relation and so on a fact. Then since Dara stands\nin the above relation to the property of swimming, the following is a\nfact:\n\n(Fact)\n\nthere is a language L, a context c and lexical items a and b of L\nsuch that a and b occur at the left and right terminal nodes\n(respectively) of the sentential relation R that in L encodes\nascription and Dara is the semantic value of a in c and the property\nof swimming is the semantic value of b in c.\n\nThat the English sentence \u2018Dara swims\u2019 exists, that\n\u2018Dara\u2019 has as its semantic value (in any context) Dara and\nthat \u2018swims\u2019 has as its semantic value (in any context)\nthe property of swimming jointly suffice for the existence of this\nfact. Equally, that the German sentence \u2018Dara schwimmt\u2019\nexists (and that the words in the sentence have the semantic values in\ncontext that they do) and that the English sentence \u2018I\nswim\u2019 taken in a context in which Dara is the speaker exists\neach suffices for the existence of this fact as well. Without the\nexistence of any such sentences, the fact in question wouldn\u2019t\nexist.\n\n(Fact), or what is the same thing, Dara standing in (Relation) to the\nproperty of swimming, is almost what King claims is the proposition\nthat Dara swims. To see what more needs to be added, note that there\nis no reason to think that (Fact) has truth conditions and so is\neither true or false. But consider again (Relation), which relates\nDara and the property of swimming in (Fact). Since Dara stands in\n(Relation) to the property of swimming in the proposition that Dara\nswims, call (Relation) the propositional relation of the proposition\nthat Dara swims. Now if this propositional relation encoded\nascription, as does the sentential relation R that is a component of\nthe propositional relation, the proposition would have truth\nconditions. For in that case, the propositional relation would be\ninterpreted as ascribing the property of swimming to Dara and so the\nproposition would be true iff Dara possesses the property of\n swimming.[13]\n Hence, King claims that the following fact is the proposition that\nDara swims, where we now include as part of the fact/proposition that\nthe propositional relation in it encodes ascription: there is a\nlanguage L, a context c and lexical items a and b of L such that a and\nb occur at the left and right terminal nodes (respectively) of the\nsentential relation R that in L encodes ascription and Dara is the\nsemantic value of a in c and the property of swimming is the semantic\nvalue of b in\n c.[14]\n Since Dara does possess the property of swimming, there is also the\nfact of her possessing this property. But note that this fact is quite\ndistinct from the fact that King claims is the proposition that Dara\nswims. Still, the former makes the latter true. But had there been no\nfact of Dara possessing the property of swimming, the fact that is the\nproposition that Dara swims would still have existed and sadly would\nhave been\n false.[15]\n\nKing claims that his account has several significant\n virtues.[16]\n First, on his account it is hard to deny that propositions exist\ngiven fairly minimal assumptions; and there is no mystery about what\nthey are. Second, his theory is naturalized, in the sense that it is\nsomething we do that endows propositions with truth\nconditions. Third, and related to the previous point, we can give some\nexplanation as to how and why propositions have truth\n conditions.[17]\n On the proposed explanation the representational powers of sentences\nand their users are explanatorily prior to those of propositions.\n\nIn more recent work, King has emended his account of propositions in\nvarious ways. On King\u2019s [2007] view, because of the role the\nsyntax of a sentence plays in the propositional relation expressed by\nthe proposition it expresses, sentences with any difference in their\nsyntactic structures express different proposition. However, in both\nKing, Speaks, & Soames [2014] and especially in King [2018], King\nformulates a version of his view that allows sentences with quite\ndifferent syntactic structures, whether in the same or different\nlanguages, to express the same proposition. In King, Speaks, &\nSoames [2014], King gives his most explicit account to date of how it\nis that propositions have truth conditions and so represent the world\nas being a certain\n way.[18]\n\n\nFinally, we turn to a discussion of a view of propositions recently\nchampioned by Scott Soames [2010a, 2010b]. Soames follows King [2007,\n2009] in rejecting the view that propositions are things that are\nrepresentational, and so have truth conditions, independently of minds\nand languages on the grounds that such a view is ultimately mysterious\nand unintelligible. Again following King, Soames thinks that the fact\nthat propositions are representational must ultimately be explained in\nterms of the representational capacities of agents. However,\nSoames\u2019 positive account of how/why propositions have truth\nconditions differs in important ways from King\u2019s.\n\nSoames begins with the notion of the mental act of predication, which\nhe takes to be primitive. However, by way of illustration, if an agent\nperceives an object o as red, and so has a perceptual\nexperience that represents o as being red, the agent\npredicates redness of o. Similarly, if an agent\n\u201cthinks of\u201d o as\n red[19],\n or \u201cform[s] the nonlinguistic perceptual belief that\no is\n red\u201d.[20]\n For Soames, predicating redness of o does not amount to\nbelieving that o is red. To believe that o is red, one\nmust predicate redness of o and do something like endorse the\npredication. It is hard to say precisely what predicating\namounts to since the notion is primitive for Soames. An agent\npredicating redness of o is an event token. Of course there may\nwell be many event tokens of agents predicating redness of some object\no by an agent perceiving it as red, an agent thinking of it as\nred and so on. Soames claims that the proposition that o is red\nis the event type of an agent predicating redness of\no. Other more complex propositions are identified with events\ntypes of agents performing sequences of primitive mental\n acts.[21]\n Soames doesn\u2019t say what he takes events (types or tokens) to\nbe. But since he thinks that propositions are structured entities with\nconstituents, he must think that event types are structured entities\nwith constituents. Presumably, the proposition that o is\nred\u2014the event type of an agent predicating redness of\no\u2014has o and redness as constituents. \n\nLike King, Soames grounds the representational capacities of\npropositions in the representational capacities of agents. Soames\nclaims that the event tokens of agents ascribing redness to o\nare things that inherently have truth conditions. They are things that\nare inherently true iff o is red. These tokens are for Soames\ntokens of the event type that is the proposition that o is red:\nthe event type of an agent predicating redness of o. Soames\nclaims that the event type that o is red has truth conditions\nbecause of its \u201cintrinsic connection\u201d to the event tokens\nof agents predicating redness of o, which, as indicated, are\nthemselves things that inherently have truth conditions.\n\nIn King, Speaks, & Soames [2014] and Soames [forthcoming], Soames\namends his theory of proposition in several respects. Two of those\nchanges are the following. First, Soames [2010] had rejected the view\nthat cognitive act types are propositions on the grounds that act type\nare things that we do, but propositions are not. In King, Speaks,\n& Soames [2014], Soames makes clear that he no longer finds this\nargument persuasive and is inclined to identify propositions with\ncognitive act types. Second, Soames gives a new account represent\nthings as being a certain way. On the new account, propositions\nrepresent things as being a certain way in a derivative sense. Just as\nan act can be intelligent in the derivative sense that in performing\nit an agent is acting intelligently, the proposition that o is red\nrepresents in the derivative sense that in performing that act an\nagent represents o as being red. \n\nPeter Hanks [2015] defends a view with some similarities to\nSoames\u2019 view discussed above. As did Soames, Hanks follows King\nin endorsing the three novel claims from King [2007] and subsequent\nwork mentioned above: (i) Hanks rejects theories according to which\npropositions have truth conditions and so represent the world as being\na certain way by their very natures and independently of minds and\nlanguages as mysterious; (ii) holds that an adequate theory of\npropositions must explain how\\why propositions have truth\nconditions and so represent the world as being a certain way; (iii)\nand holds that since the representational capacities of propositions\ncannot be something they have inherently and by their natures, their\nrepresentational capacities must derive from and be explained by the\nrepresentational capacities of thinking agents. \n\nIn simple cases of judging and asserting, Hanks claims we perform\nactions of predicating properties of objects. In judging that Donald\nTrump is a demagogue without speaking, one thinks of Trump (refers to\nhim in thought), thinks of the property of being a demagogue\n(expresses the property in thought) and predicates the property of\nTrump. In asserting that Trump is a demagogue, one refers to him,\nexpresses the property and predicates it of him, here using linguistic\nmeans. According to Hanks, in predicating a property of an object, one\nportrays the object as being a certain way and so does something that\nis true or false. Hence, Hanks claims these token acts of predicating\nare true or false. Hanks notion of predication is inherently assertive\nand committing, unlike Soames\u2019 notion of predication. There is\nnot some non-committal thing you do in predicating and then add\nendorsement or commitment. On Hanks view, predicating is\ncommitting to the object possessing the property in question. The\nproposition that Donald Trump is a demagogue is the act type of\npredicating being a demagogue of Trump. Hanks holds that this\nact type would exist even if it had no tokens. In general, whether\nthey have tokens or not, Hanks holds that the act types that are\npropositions exist. \n\nThe proposition that Trump is a demagogue is the act type of referring\nto Trump, expressing the property of being a demagogue and predicating\nit of Trump, as we have seen. What Hanks calls the interrogative\nproposition expressible by the question \u2018Is Trump a\ndemagogue?\u2019 is the act type of referring to Trump, expressing\nthe property of being a demagogue and combining Trump and the property\nin an interrogative way (rather than predicating the property\nof Trump). Hanks gives a similar account of the imperative\nproposition expressed by the command \u2018Trump, be a\ndemagogue!\u2019 As a result, Hanks rejects the claim that there is\nsome common underlying content running through the (assertive)\nproposition, imperative proposition and interrogative proposition\nregarding Trump being a demagogue. There are just three different\npropositions here with their different \u201cforces\u201d\n(assertive, interrogative, imperative) built in. \n\nHanks\u2019 explanation of why propositions as act types of the sort\ndescribed have truth conditions comes in two steps. First, Hanks\nargues that token acts of predicating properties of objects have truth\nconditions. Hanks recognizes that some may doubt whether act tokens\nare the kinds of things that can be true and false. His main argument\nthat they can be is that we have adverbial modifiers\n\u2018truly\u2019 and \u2018falsely\u2019 and that these attribute\nproperties to action tokens. So just as \u2018quickly\u2019 in\n\u2018Obama quickly stated that Clinton is eloquent.\u2019\nattributes a property to Obamas\u2019s action, so Hanks claims that\n\u2018truly\u2019 in \u2018Obama truly stated that Clinton is\neloquent.\u2019 attributes the property of being true to an action of\nObama. Hanks then tries to argue that the action type of\npredicating being a demagogue of Cruz inherits the property of having\ntruth conditions from its instances. Note that here it must be actual\nand possible instances that truth conditions are inherited from, since\nHanks wants propositions that have never been and never will be\ntokened to have truth conditions. The argument here is complex since\nHanks notes that types inherit certain kinds of properties from tokens\nand not others. Hence, Hanks seeks to explain why the having of truth\nconditions is the kind of property a type inherits from its (actual\nand possible) tokens. \n\nOn Hanks\u2019 theory there are many more propositions than one might\nhave thought. First, there is the proposition that is the act type\nconsisting of referring to Clinton using \u2018Clinton\u2019 and\npredicating eloquence of her. It is true iff Clinton is eloquent. Then\nthere is a distinct proposition with those same truth conditions that\nis the act of referring to Clinton in any way whatsoever and\npredicating eloquence of her. Next, there is another proposition with\nthese same truth conditions consisting of the act of referring to\nClinton using \u2018Clinton\u2019 while thinking of her as\nObama\u2019s former secretary of state and predicating eloquence of\nher. In addition, there is another proposition with the same truth\nconditions consisting of referring to Clinton using\n\u2018Clinton\u2019 while thinking of her as a former first lady and\npredicating eloquence of her. And so on. Again, all these propositions\nare true iff Clinton is eloquent. There is even a proposition\nconsisting of referring to Clinton using \u2018Clinton\u2019 while\ndrawing a round square and predicating eloquence of her.\n [22]\n\n\nAbove we saw that for Hanks, predication endows propositions with an\ninherent element of judgment or assertion. Predicating a property of\nan object commits the predicator to the object having that\nproperty. For Hanks, she did something false if it doesn\u2019t. But\nthis raises a problem for him. In disjunctive, negated, conditional\npropositions and others, embedded propositions do not have assertive\nforce. They aren\u2019t asserted. But if these embedded propositions\ninherently have an assertoric or judgmental element, how can this be?\nTo address this Hanks claims that \u2018or\u2019, \u2018if\u2019\nand \u2018not\u2019 create cancellation contexts. Since e.g.\n\u2018or\u2019 creates a cancellation context on Hanks\u2019\nview, in uttering the following sentence I fail to assert that Trump\nis a demagogue:\n\nTrump is a demagogue or Clinton is eloquent. \n\nEach disjunct expresses a proposition that includes as a sub act the\nact of predicating a property of the object according to Hanks. But\nthe predication is cancelled. Hence, the asserting/committing element\nin the proposition is cancelled. Hanks must walk a very fine line\nhere. The inherently assertive committal aspect of predication is what\nexplains both that propositions are true and false and that unembedded\npropositions make\n assertions.[23]\n To explain why some embedded propositions don\u2019t make\nassertions, Hanks appeals to the notion of the predication being\ncancelled in virtue of occurring in a cancellation context. But of\ncourse Hanks will want to say that the embedded proposition still has\ntruth conditions and is true or false. Somehow in canceling the\npredication, though assertive force is cancelled the truth conditions\nand truth-value aren\u2019t, even though predication is responsible\nfor both. \n\nAbove it was mentioned that King [2007] and subsequent work endorsed\nthree novel claims about propositions. Two of these are: (i) theories\naccording to which propositions have truth conditions and so represent\nthe world as being a certain way by their very natures and\nindependently of minds and languages are mysterious and to be\nrejected; (ii) an adequate theory of propositions must explain\nhow\\why propositions have truth conditions and so represent the world\nas being a certain\n way.[24]\n It was also noted that Soames and Hanks follow King in this respect.\nIn a sense, Speaks does too insofar as he feels the need to explain\nthe \u201caboutness\u201d or intentionality of some mental\n states.[25]\n So most recent literature has taken onboard King\u2019s two claims\nabove. Philosophy being what it is, however, there have been recent\ntheorists who want to return to something like the classical theories\nof Frege and Russell, where propositions were thought to be mind and\nlanguage independent abstract objects that by their very natures had\ntruth conditions and so represent the world as being a certain way. On\nsuch a view, both of King\u2019s claims are rejected. Propositions\nare precisely held to have truth conditions by their natures and\nindependently of minds and languages; and it is denied that there can\nbe any explanation of how/why propositions have truth conditions.\nTrenton Merricks [2015] defends such a view. According to Merricks,\npropositions are abstract, necessary existents that essentially\nrepresent the world as being a certain\n way.[26]\n He also holds that the fact that propositions essentially represent\nthings as being a certain way is primitive. That is, this fact has no\n explanation.[27]\n Further, Merricks holds that propositions are simple: they have no\n constituents.[28]\n On this last point at least Merricks departs from the classical views\nof Frege and Russell on which propositions do have constituents. \n\nLorraine Juliano Keller [2014] expresses sympathy for a similar view\nthat she calls propositional primitivism. On this view,\npropositions are fine-grained sui generis entities. They are\nnot reducible to nor can they be explained by entities in another\nontological category. Her primitivist thinks that not much of anything\ncan be said about the inner nature of propositions except that they\nare abstract, mind and language independent entities with no\nconstituents or structure. While King, Soames, Hanks and perhaps\nSpeaks see in such a view mystery or worse, primitivists like Keller\nand Merricks see elegance and simplicity. \n3.2 The Structured Intension Approach\n\nHaving seen the main features of neo-Russellian approaches, let us\nturn to structured meaning accounts. The roots of these accounts can\nbe traced to Rudolf Carnap [1947], and his notion of intensional\nisomorphism. David Lewis [1972] and Max Cresswell [1985] have worked\nout similar, detailed versions of the structured meanings approach,\nthough there are important differences in their views.\nCresswell\u2019s [1985] version of the view will be discussed\n here.[29]\n Because our concern is with conceptions of structured propositions,\nthere are many features of Cresswell [1985] that will not be discussed\n(e.g. Cresswell\u2019s account of the semantics of verbs of\npropositional attitude).\n\nBoth Lewis [1972] and Cresswell [1985] are motivated by some of the\nsame considerations that motivated neo-Russellians like Salmon and\nSoames. Lewis and Cresswell both wish to find a more fine grained\n\u201csemantic value\u201d for sentences than functions from worlds\n(or, as in Lewis [1972], indices) to truth values or, equivalently,\nsets of worlds. For example, Cresswell [1985] claims that verbs of\npropositional attitude are (sometimes) sensitive to more than the\nintensions (functions from worlds/indices to truth values) of the\nsentences they embed. Thus Cresswell claims that\n\n\n\u2026one might easily have two sentences \u03b1 and\n\u03b2 that are true in exactly the same worlds and yet are\nsuch that\n\nx \u03c6s that \u03b1\n\nis true, but\n\nx \u03c6s that \u03b2\n\nis false. (Cresswell [1985] p. 73; \u03c6 of course is a verb of\npropositional attitude).\n\n\nThus Cresswell wishes to associate with a sentence (or more\naccurately, a \u2018that\u2019 clause) some semantic value that is\nmore fine grained than a set of worlds, so that attitude verbs may\n(sometimes) distinguish between sentences that are true in exactly the\nsame worlds. Strictly, Cresswell holds that sometimes attitude verbs\nare sensitive only to the sets of worlds in which the sentences they\nembed are true (i.e. their intensions); but sometimes attitude verbs\nare sensitive to more than this. In these latter cases, Cresswell\nwishes to associate a semantic value more fine grained than a set of\nworlds with the embedded sentence (or \u2018that\u2019 clause).\nCresswell accomplishes this by holding that \u2018that\u2019 in\nEnglish attaches to a sentence to form a name, and that\n\u2018that\u2019 in this role is highly ambiguous. In one of its\nmeanings, \u2018that\u2019 attaches to a sentence and forms a name\nof the intension of the sentence (i.e. the set of worlds in which it\nis\n true).[30]\n In such cases, the attitude verb is sensitive only to the intension\nnamed by the \u2018that\u2019 clause following it. However,\n\u2018that\u2019 has another meaning on which it combines with a\nsentence to form the name of a much more fine-grained entity (in the\nsense that sentences true in all the same worlds may be associated\nwith different fine-grained entities). In such cases, verbs of\nattitude are sensitive to differences in these fine-grained entities.\nSince our concern is with structured propositions, or with semantic\nvalues of sentences more fine grained than sets of worlds, the focus\nwill henceforth be on Cresswell\u2019s account of these fine-grained\nentities named by some \u2018that\u2019\n clauses.[31]\n Henceforth, then, when the fine grained entity associated with a\nsentence or \u2018that\u2019 clause on Cresswell\u2019s view is\ndiscussed, what is being discussed is what a \u2018that\u2019 clause\ncontaining the sentence names, given that the meaning of\n\u2018that\u2019 in the \u2018that\u2019 clause is the one that\nwhen combined with the sentence yields a name of the most fine grained\nentity named by any \u2018that\u2019 clause in which the sentence\noccurs. This is important to bear in mind, since for Cresswell,\nstrictly speaking, a sentence not in a \u2018that\u2019 clause does\nnot express this fine grained entity.\n\nConsider the sentence\n\n(7) Max\nruns.\n\n\nFor Cresswell, the meaning of a predicate like \u2018runs\u2019 is\nessentially its intension: a function from individuals to sets of\nworlds (it maps an individual to the worlds at which she\n runs).[32]\n Let Ir be this intension. The meaning of a\nname like \u2018Max\u2019 (in some cases at least) is simply its\nreferent: o. Thus, the fine grained entity associated with (7)\nis the ordered pair:\n\n(7a) <\u2009o,\nIr\u2009>\n\n\nThe negation of (7) will be associated with the following:\n\n(7b) <\u2009NOT,\n<\u2009o,\nIr\u2009>\u2009>\n\n\nwhere NOT is the function from sets of worlds to sets of worlds that\nmaps a set of worlds to its complement. Finally, the sentence:\n\n(8) Someone\nruns.\n\n\nis associated with\n\n(8a) <\u2009\u03a3,\nIr\u2009>\n\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the function from functions from individuals to sets\nof worlds to sets of worlds such that \u03a3(f)={w: for\nsome o, w is in f(o)}. \n\nIt should be clear that as on the neo-Russellian approach, sentences\nthat are true in all the same worlds may be associated with different\nfine grained entities of the sort posited by Cresswell. For example,\neven if \u2018All brothers are siblings\u2019 and \u2018All\nbachelors are male\u2019 are true in exactly the same worlds, the\nfine grained entity associated with the latter will contain the\nmeaning (function from individuals to sets of worlds) of\n\u2018male\u2019 and the fine grained entity associated with the\nformer will not. It should also be clear that the semantic values of\nexpressions are recoverable from the propositions expressed by\nsentences containing them. For example, the semantic value of\n\u2018runs\u2019 as it occurs in (7) is a constituent of the\nfine-grained entity expressed by (7) (i.e. (7a)). Similar remarks\napply to (7b) and (8a).\n\nA final remark about Cresswell\u2019s view is in order. The\nfine-grained entities we have been discussing are what verbs of\npropositional attitude are sensitive to when they are sensitive to\nmore than the intension/set of worlds associated with a sentence they\nembed. However, they do not seem to be the primary bearers of truth\nfor Cresswell. For Cresswell, each sentence is associated with a set\nof worlds/intension, which Cresswell calls a proposition; and the\ntruth or falsity of a sentence at a world is determined by what\nproposition it expresses. So these seem to be the primary bearers of\ntruth and falsity for\n Cresswell.[33]\n Thus, it appears that for Cresswell, in contrast to the\nneo-Russellians, the primary bearers of truth and falsity and the fine\ngrained entities associated with the sentences (or \u2018that\u2019\nclauses) that verbs of attitude embed and to which they are\n(sometimes) sensitive are different.\n3.3 The Algebraic Approach\n\nFinally, we turn to algebraic approaches. Though Bealer in some sense\nadopts an algebraic approach to propositions (see the above\ndiscussion), he apparently holds that propositions have no (set\ntheoretic or mereological) parts, and so doesn\u2019t count as a\nstructured proposition theorist in the sense in which the term is used\nhere. Thus, we will consider here adherents to the algebraic approach\nwho do hold that the propositions yielded by their algebras are\ncomplex and have \u201cparts\u201d. Aside from Bealer [1979, 1982\nand 1993], work in this tradition includes Edward Zalta [1983 and\n1988], and Christopher Menzel [1993]. The focus here will be on the\nformulations in Edward Zalta [1988]. Though Zalta has an extensive,\naxiomatized theory of propositions, and ordinary and abstract\nindividuals, properties, and relations, we confine our attention here\nto his view about propositions. Still, since Zalta views propositions\nas zero-place relations, we will say something about his views on\nproperties and relations.\n\nAdvocates of the algebraic approach such as Zalta, like the\nneo-Russellians and the advocates of structured meaning approaches,\nthink that a good theory of propositions must allow for distinct,\nnecessarily equivalent propositions. Thus, he writes:\n\n\u201cNecessarily equivalent propositions may be distinct. If the\ntheory of propositions is not fine-grained enough to distinguish\nnecessarily equivalent propositions, the ability to accurately\nrepresent belief is lost\u201d (Zalta 1988, p. 57)\n\n\nTo appreciate how Zalta achieves the goal of having a fine-grained\ntheory of propositions, we begin by discussing how he views relations\ngenerally, since, as just mentioned, Zalta takes propositions to be\nzero-place relations (and properties to be one-place relations). Zalta\nholds that relations are \u201cprimitive entities\u201d, by which he\nmeans that they are not to be explained or \u201cdefined\u201d in\nterms of other entities/notions. But at least some relations are\ncomplex. For example, if we take a two-place relation (between\nobjects) Rxy and \u201cplug\u201d one of its\nargument places with the object b, we get the one-place\nrelation (property) Rxb (\u201cbearing R\nto\n b\u201d).[34]\n This one-place relation is complex, having b and R as\nparts. Similarly, if we take a three-place relation\nSxyz and \u201cuniversalize\u201d the\nthird argument position, we get a two place relation that we might\nrepresent thus: (z)Sxyz\n(\u201cx and y (in that order) stand in S to\neverything\u201d). Here again, the two-place relation is complex,\nhaving S and (something corresponding to)\n\u201cuniversalization\u201d as parts. Zalta\u2019s idea is that\nproperties, relations and individuals can be \u201charnessed\ntogether\u201d to form new, complex relations. In his axiomatized\ntheory of relations, Zalta introduces a comprehension schema for\nrelations (see Zalta [1988] p. 46) that insures that all manner of\ncomplex relations will be available. To insure that all instances of\nthe comprehension schema are true in all interpretations of his\naxiomatized theory, Zalta has these interpretations include the\nfollowing group of \u201clogical functions\u201d:\nPLUGi, NEG, COND, UNIVi,\nREFLi, j CONVi, j,\nVACi, NEC, WAS and WILL. Roughly (and suppressing\nreference to worlds and times) PLUGi is a function\nthat maps an n-place relation R and an object b\nto the n-1 place relation R\u2032 such that\n<\u2009o1, \u2026,\noi-1, oi+1,\n\u2026, on\u2009> stand in\nR\u2032 iff <\u2009o1, \u2026,\noi-1, b,\noi+1, \u2026,\non\u2009> stand in R. NEG is a\nfunction that maps an n-place relation R to an\nn-place relation R\u2032 such that n things\nstand in R\u2032 iff they don\u2019t stand in\n R.[35]\n Thus the repeated application of these functions yields appropriate\nrelations to make true the instances of Zalta\u2019s comprehension\nschema for relations. For example, consider the following two\ninstances of his comprehension schema (where \u2018F\u2032 is\na variable ranging over one-place relations; \u2018b\u2019 is\na name of an individual; and the other predicate letters are constants\nand so name particular\n relations):[36]\n\n(\u2203F)(Fx iff Rxb) \n\n(\u2203F)(Fx iff ~Px) \n\nIf we apply PLUG2 to the individual denoted by\n\u2018b\u2019 and the (two-place) relation denoted by\n\u2018R\u2019, we get a one-place relation that makes the\nfirst instance of the schema true; and if we apply NEG to the\ndenotation of \u2018P\u2019, we get a one-place relation that\nmakes the second instance true.\n\nAs we have mentioned, propositions are zero-place relations for Zalta.\nThus, PLUGi and the rest of the \u201clogical\nfunctions\u201d mentioned above can be applied to various entities to\nyield propositions. Thus the proposition expressed by a sentence like\n\n\nEd runs.\n\nis the result of applying the PLUG1 function to the\nproperty of running and Ed. This proposition consists of Ed saturating\nthe one argument place of the running property. Similarly, a sentence\nlike\n\nEd does not run.\n\nexpresses the proposition that is the result of applying\nPLUG1 to running and Ed as before, and then applying NEG to\nthe output of PLUG1. Finally, a sentence like\n\nEverything runs.\n\nexpresses the result of applying UNIV1 to the property of\nrunning. This idea that there is some group of \u201clogical\nfunctions\u201d whose repeated application to some other entities\nyield complex propositions (and relations) is characteristic of what\nare being called algebraic approaches.\n\nIt should be clear that necessarily equivalent sentences may express\ndistinct propositions on Zalta\u2019s view. For example, the\nsentences \u2018All brother are male siblings\u2019 and \u2018All\nbachelors are unmarried\u2019 express propositions that are true in\nall possible worlds. But the first expresses a proposition that\nresults from applying COND to the properties of being a brother and\nbeing a male sibling, and applying REFL1,2 and then\nUNIV1 to the output of COND. The second does not, but\ninstead results from applying these functions in the same order to the\nproperties of being a bachelor and being unmarried. Further, it should\nbe clear that the semantic values of expressions are recoverable from\nthe propositions expressed by sentences in which they occur. E.g. both\nEd and the property of running, which are the semantic values of\n\u2018Ed\u2019 and \u2018runs\u2019, are constituents of the\nproposition that Ed runs, which is expressed by \u2018Ed runs\u2019,\nsince this proposition consists of Ed saturating the one argument\nplace in the property of running.\n\nHaving sketched Zalta\u2019s view of propositions it is worth\nmentioning a couple points about it. First, at least in some cases,\nwhat binds together the constituents of a proposition is in some sense\n\u201cbuilt into\u201d one of the constituents of the proposition\nfor Zalta, (as we shall see below, the same is true for Frege and\nRussell). Consider again the sentence:\n\nEd runs.\n\nRecall that this sentence expresses the proposition that results from\napplying PLUG1 to Ed and the property of running. The\noutput is Ed saturating (\u201cplugged into\u201d) the one argument\nplace of the property of running. There are two things to notice about\nthis proposal. First, it is one of the constituents of the\nproposition, the running property, that binds the constituents of the\nproposition together. The proposition is held together in virtue of Ed\n\u201cplugging\u201d the one argument place in the running property.\nSecond, the proposition just is Ed \u201cplugging\u201d/possessing\nthat property!\n\nSuch a view immediately raises a worry about false propositions\n(discussed below in connection with Russell\u2019s POM account of\npropositions). For one might argue as follows. Suppose Ed\ndoesn\u2019t run. Then Ed doesn\u2019t plug/saturate the one\nargument place in the property of running (i.e. doesn\u2019t possess\nthis property). But Ed possessing the running property just is the\nproposition that Ed runs. Thus there is no proposition that Ed runs.\nSimilar reasoning shows that any other false proposition fails to\nexist. So there are no false propositions.\n\nObviously, Zalta does not want to be saddled with this result, and he\nisn\u2019t. He holds that the even if Ed doesn\u2019t run, there is\na proposition consisting of Ed saturating the argument place in the\nrunning property. That proposition simply isn\u2019t true. To put the\npoint somewhat paradoxically, even if Ed doesn\u2019t run, he\npossesses the property of running, so that we have our (false)\nproposition.\n\nTo some, Zalta will appear to have confused a proposition with what\nmakes it true. Ed possessing the running property isn\u2019t the\nproposition that Ed runs, one might think. It is what makes that\nproposition true! Of course Zalta must deny this. Having identified\nthe proposition with the thing that other theorists take to be what\nmakes the proposition true, Zalta holds that nothing outside of the\nproposition makes it true:\n\nThe metaphysical truth or falsity of these logical complexes\n[propositions] is basic. If a proposition is true, there is nothing\nelse that \u201cmakes it true\u201d. Its being true is just the way\nthings are (arranged). (Zalta [1988] p.56)\n\n\nSo the idea is that whether Ed runs or not, he saturates the one\nargument place in the running property, so that we have the\nproposition that Ed runs. If Ed does run, so that the proposition is\ntrue, it is just a basic, brute fact that the proposition is true.\n\nFinally, though we shall not go into it here, it is worth mentioning\nthat when Zalta gets to the semantics of verbs of propositional\nattitudes, it is not only the propositions considered thus far that\nare objects of the attitudes and make belief ascriptions true or\nfalse. Zalta ends up claiming that sentences embedded with respect to\nattitude verbs are ambiguous, sometimes expressing the sorts of\npropositions we are discussing, and sometimes expressing other\npropositions that instead of containing the individuals, properties\nand relations thus far discussed, contain senses of these individuals,\nproperties and relations. These senses are \u201cabstract\u201d\nindividuals and relations, instead of the ordinary individuals and\nrelations discussed thus far. Hence Zalta ends up with a theory of\nbelief ascriptions that invokes both fine-grained propositions and\nneo-Fregean senses. The interested reader should consult Zalta [1988].\n\n4. Historical Antecedents to Current Views: Frege\n\nAs with many ideas discussed in contemporary philosophy of language,\nthe idea that propositions are structured is present in Gottlob\nFrege\u2019s writings. Frege had a view both about the constituents\nof structured propositions and about what held these constituents\ntogether in the proposition. Frege held that simple linguistic\nexpressions are associated with entities he called senses. Though\nthere is some controversy about precisely how to understand the notion\nof sense, Frege explicitly distinguishes the sense of a linguistic\nexpression from both the subjective ideas speakers associate with the\nexpression and the thing in the world the expression \u201cstands\nfor\u201d. Further, the sense of an expression determines what thing\nin the world the expression stands for. Thus the sense of a proper\nname such as \u2018Ronald Reagan\u2019 must be distinguished from\nany subjective ideas speakers associate with the name (e.g. feelings\nof anger, fondness, etc.) and from Reagan himself. And the sense of\nthe name \u201cpicks out\u201d Reagan as the thing in the world the\nname stands for. It may help to think of the sense as some descriptive\ncondition satisfied uniquely by Reagan (and not to think any more\nabout what is meant by a descriptive condition). Complex linguistic\nexpressions are also associated with senses. And Frege held that the\nsense of a complex expression is a function of the senses of its\nsimple parts and how they are put together. Frege called propositions\nthoughts (Gedanken), and held that the thought/proposition expressed\nby a sentence is itself a sense. And, like the senses of other complex\nlinguistic expressions, the proposition/thought expressed by a\nsentence is a function of the senses of the words in the sentence and\nhow they are put together. Now Frege at least sometimes appears to\nhold the stronger view that the sense of a sentence\n(proposition/thought) has as constituents the senses of the words in\nthe sentence. And as the following quotation shows, his account of how\nthese sense-constituents are held together in the proposition/thought\ndepends on different kinds of linguistic expressions having different\nkinds of senses:\n\nFor not all parts of a thought can be complete; at least one must be\n\u2018unsaturated\u2019, or predicative; otherwise they would not\nhold together. For example, the sense of the phrase \u2018the number\n2\u2019 does not hold together with that of the expression \u2018the\nconcept prime number \u2018 without a link. We apply such a link in\nthe sentence \u2018the number 2 falls under the concept prime\nnumber\u2019; it is contained in the words \u2018falls under\u2019,\nwhich need to be completed in two ways\u2014by a subject and an\naccusative; and only because their sense is thus\n\u2018unsaturated\u2019 are they capable of serving as a link.\n(Frege [1892] p. 54)\n\n\nRemarks like this suggest that Frege\u2019s view was that\npropositions are complex entities whose parts are other senses. The\nproposition is held together in virtue of the fact that at least one\nof the senses is unsaturated (Frege sometimes also says predicative,\nor in need of supplementation). Other senses \u201csaturate\u201d or\ncomplete the unsaturated senses and in so doing are bound to them to\nform the proposition/thought. Thus, on this way of interpreting Frege,\nthe mechanism for binding together the constituents of a structured\nproposition is built right into some of the constituents, (recall that\nthis was true of the view of Zalta [1988] as well).\n5. Historical Antecedents to Current Views: Russell\n\nBertrand Russell, to whom many current structured propositions\ntheorists attribute the idea of structured propositions, held various\nviews about the nature of propositions over the course of his career.\nHowever, the account of propositions held by Russell that is thought\nby many to be the progenitor of current accounts of structured\npropositions is the one Russell defended in Russell [1903]. We shall\nconfine our attention to that account here. Russell differed with\nFrege both on what the constituents of structured propositions are and\non what binds them together in the proposition. Russell uses the word\n\u2018term\u2019 for constituents of propositions. Thus he\nwrites:\n\nWhatever may be an object of thought, or may occur in any true or\nfalse proposition \u2026I call a term\u2026.A man, a moment, a\nnumber, a class, a relation, a chimaera, or anything else that can be\nmentioned, is sure to be a term; and to deny that such and such a\nthing is a term must always be false. (Russell [1903] p. 43)\n\n\nThus we already see that Russell differs from Frege on what kinds of\nthings can be constituents of propositions. For Frege, all\nconstituents of propositions are senses. For Russell, a man or a\nmountain can be a constituent of a proposition. In a now famous\ncorrespondence with Frege, Russell replied to Frege\u2019s assertion\nthat the sense of the name \u2018Mont Blanc\u2019, and not Mont\nBlanc itself \u201cwith all its snowfields\u201d, occurs in the\nproposition/thought that Mont Blanc is 4,000 meters high, by saying:\n\n\nI believe that in spite of all its snowfields Mont Blanc itself is a\ncomponent part of what is actually asserted in the proposition\n\u2018Mont Blanc is more than 4,000 metres high\u2019. (Frege [PMC]\np. 169)\n\n\nRussell goes on to distinguish two kinds of terms or propositional\nconstituents:\n\nAmong terms, it is possible to distinguish two kinds, which I shall\ncall respectively things and concepts. The former are the terms\nindicated by proper names, the latter those indicated by all other\nwords. (Russell [1903] p. 44)\n\n\nSo for Russell, all propositional constituents are things or concepts.\nOn Russell\u2019s view, a sentence such as:\n\nSocrates is human\n\nexpresses a proposition with three constituents, corresponding to the\nthree words in the sentence. Socrates himself is one of the\nconstituents, the other two constituents being the concepts\ncontributed by \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018human\u2019.\n\nHaving seen that Russell held different kinds of things to be\nconstituents of propositions than did Frege, we shall turn to his\nviews on what binds together the constituents of structured\npropositions. Russell appears to hold that the propositional\ncontributions of verbs (which contributions Russell often calls verbs)\nhold together the constituents of propositions. Thus he writes:\n\nConsider, for example, the proposition \u2018A differs from\nB\u2019. The constituents of this proposition, if we analyze\nit, appear to be only A, difference, B. Yet these\nconstituents, thus placed side by side, do not reconstitute the\nproposition. The difference which occurs in the proposition actually\nrelates A and B, whereas the difference after analysis\nis a notion which has no connection with A and B.\n(Russell [1903] p. 49)\n\n\nAnd later Russell writes:\n\nOwing to the way in which the verb [propositional contribution of a\nverb] actually relates the terms of a proposition, every proposition\nhas a unity which renders it distinct from the sum of its\nconstituents. (Russell [1903] p. 52)\n\n\nRussell\u2019s idea that a proposition is something beyond the sum of\nits constituents certainly seems correct. The collection, or\nmereological sum, of A, difference and B is not the\nproposition that A differs from B. Different\npropositions may have the same Russellian constituents, as with the\npropositions expressed by the following sentence pair:\n\nJason loves Patti.\n\nPatti loves Jason.\n\nHowever, Russell\u2019s idea that the propositional contribution of\nthe verb binds the constituents together (in different ways in the\ncase of our pair of sentences) is hard to understand. In the next to\nlast quotation from Russell above, he suggests that the proposition\nexpressed by \u2018A differs from B\u2019, whose\nconstituents are A, difference and B, is held together\nby difference actually obtaining between A and B. If we\ncall difference a relation, the proposition would consist of A\nstanding in the relation of difference to B. Russell makes a\nnumber of remarks that suggest that this is his view. But it would\nseem that this cannot be correct. Intuitively, A standing in\nthe relation of difference to B is what makes the proposition\nthat A differs from B true. It is not the proposition\nitself. For if it were, it would seem that if A doesn\u2019t\nstand in the difference relation to B, then there is no (false)\nproposition to the effect that A differs from B. And\nquite generally, for the same reason it would appear that there are no\nfalse propositions. Perhaps Russell meant that propositional\ncontributions of verbs hold propositional constituents together in\nsome other manner. But it certainly is not clear what that manner\nwould be. Or perhaps he held a view similar to Zalta\u2019s discussed\nabove.\n",
