At the end of\nAugust, 1918, he began writing The Star of Redemption and\nsending what he wrote back home to his mother on military postcards.\nAfter the war ended, he returned home first to Kassel, and then to\nFreiburg, devoting himself entirely to writing. He finished the\nStar in the middle of February, 1919.\n",
