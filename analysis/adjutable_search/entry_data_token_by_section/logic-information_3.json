    "main_text": "Information as Range || Quantitative Approaches\n1.3 Quantitative Approaches\n\nQuantitative approaches to information as range also have\ntheir origins in the inverse relationship principle. To\nrestate\u2014the motivation being that the less likely the truth of a\nproposition as expressed in a logical language with respect to a\nparticular domain, the greater the amount of information encoded by\nthe relevant formula. This is in contrast to the information measures\nin the mathematical theory of communication (Shannon 1953\n[1950]) where such measures are gotten via an inverse relationship on\nthe expectation of the receiver \\(R\\) of the receipt of a signal from\nsome source \\(S\\).\n\nAnother important aspect of the classical theory of information, is\nthat it is an entirely static theory\u2014it is concerned\nwith the informational content and measure of particular formulas, and\nnot with information flow in any way at all.\n\nThe formal details of classical information theory turn on the\nprobability calculus. These details may be left aside here, as the\nobvious conceptual point is that logical truths have a\ntruth-likelihood of 1, and therefore an information measure of 0.\nBar-Hillel and Carnap did not take this to mean that logical truths,\nor deductions, were without information yield, only that their theory\nof semantic information was not designed to capture such a property.\nThey referred to such a property with the term psychological\ninformation. See Floridi (2013) for further details.\n\nA quantitative attempt at specifying the information yield of\ndeductions was undertaken by Jaakko Hintikka with his theory of\nsurface information and depth information (Hintikka\n1970, 1973). The theory of surface and depth information extends\nBar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s theory of semantic information from the\nmonadic predicate calculus all the way up to the full polyadic\npredicate calculus. This itself is a considerable achievement, but\nalthough technically astounding, a serious restriction of this\napproach is that it is only a fragment of the deductions carried out\nwithin full first-order logic that yield a non-zero information\nmeasure. The rest of the deductions in the full polyadic predicate\ncalculus, as well as all of those in the monadic predicate calculus\nand propositional calculus, measure 0, (see Sequoiah-Grayson 2008).\nFor recent elaborations upon Hintikka\u2019s distinction between\nsuface and depth information, both formal and philosophical, see\nPanahy (2023), Hernandez and Quiroz (2022 [Other Internet Resources]),\nNegro (2022), and Ramos Mendon\u00e7a (2022).\n\nThe obvious inverse situation with the theory of classical semantic\ninformation is that logical contradictions, having a truth-likelihood\nof 0, will deliver a maximal information measure of 1. Referred to in\nthe literature as the Bar-Hillel-Carnap Semantic Paradox, the\nmost developed quantitative approach to addressing it is the theory of\nstrongly semantic information (Floridi 2004). The conceptual\nmotivation behind strongly semantic information is that for a\nstatement to yield information, it must help us to narrow down the set\nof possible worlds. That is, it must assist us in the search for the\nactual world, so to speak (Sequoiah-Grayson 2007). Such a\ncontingency requirement on informativeness is violated by\nboth logical truths and logical contradictions, both of which measure\n0 on the theory of strongly semantic information. See Floridi (2013)\nfor further details. See also Brady (2016) for recent work on the\nrelationship between quantitative accounts of information and\nanalyticity. For a new approach to connecting quantitative and\nqualitative measures of information, see Harrison-Trainor et\nal. (2018)\n",
