    "main_text": "A Moral Case for Voluntary Euthanasia\n3. A Moral Case for Voluntary Euthanasia\n\nOne central ethical contention in support of voluntary euthanasia is\nthat respect for persons demands respect for their autonomous choices\nas long as those choices do not result in harm to others. Respect for\npeople\u2019s autonomous choices is directly connected with the\nrequirement for competence because autonomy presupposes competence\n(cf., Brock 1992). People have an interest in making important\ndecisions about their lives in accordance with their own conception of\nhow they want to live. In exercising autonomy, or self-determination,\nindividuals take responsibility for their lives; since dying is a part\nof life, choices about the manner of their dying and the timing of\ntheir death are, for many people, part of what is involved in taking\nresponsibility for their lives. Many are concerned about what the last\nphase of their lives will be like, not merely because of fears that\ntheir dying might involve them in great suffering, but also because of\nthe desire to retain their dignity, and as much control over their\nlives as possible, during this phase. A second contention in support\nof voluntary euthanasia was mentioned at the beginning of this entry,\nnamely the importance of promoting the well-being of persons. When\nsomeone is suffering intolerable pain or only has available a life\nthat is unacceptably burdensome (see the third condition above), and\nhe competently requests medical assistance with dying, his well-being\nmay best be promoted by affording him that assistance. When harnessed\ntogether, the value to individuals of making autonomous choices, and\nthe value to those individuals who make such choices of promoting\ntheir own well-being, provide the moral foundation for requests for\nvoluntary euthanasia. Each consideration is necessary for moral\njustification of the practice, but taken in isolation neither suffices\n(see, e.g., Young 2007, 2017; Sumner 2011, 2017).\n\nThe technological interventions of modern medicine have had the effect\nof stretching out the time it takes for many people to die. Sometimes\nthe added life this brings is an occasion for rejoicing; sometimes it\ndrags out the period of significant physical and intellectual decline\nthat a person undergoes with the result that life becomes no longer\nworth living. Many believe there is no single, objectively correct\nanswer as to when, if at all, a person\u2019s life becomes a burden\nand hence unwanted. If they are right, that simply points up the\nimportance of individuals being able to decide autonomously for\nthemselves whether their own lives retain sufficient quality and\ndignity to make life worth living. Others maintain that individuals\ncan be in error about whether their lives continue to be worth living\n(cf., Foot 1977). The conditions outlined above in Section 2 are\nintended by those who propose them to serve, among other purposes, to\nsafeguard against such error. But it is worth adding that in the event\nthat a person who considers that she satisfies those conditions is\njudged by her medical attendants to be in error about whether it would\nbe worth her continuing to live, the likely outcome is that those\nattendants will refuse to provide medical assistance with dying.\n(Evidence that will be mentioned below shows that this happens\nfrequently in jurisdictions in which medically assisted dying has been\nlegalized.) Unless a patient is able to be transferred to the care of\nother medical professionals who accept her assessment, she will have\nto rely on her own resources (e.g., by refusing nutrition and\nhydration). Even so, other things being equal, as long as a critically\nill person is competent, her own judgement of whether continued life\nis a benefit to her ought to carry the greatest weight in any\nend-of-life decision making regardless of whether she is in a severely\ncompromised and debilitated state. The idea that a competent\nindividual\u2019s autonomous judgment of the value to her of\ncontinued life should trump an assessment by others of her well-being\nshould not be thought surprising because precisely the same happens\nwhen a competent patient refuses life-prolonging treatment.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of argument, that it is agreed that we should\nrespect a person\u2019s competent request for medical assistance with\ndying (e.g., so as to enable her to achieve her autonomously chosen\ngoal of an easeful death). It might be thought that in such an\neventuality different moral concerns will be introduced from those\nthat arise in connection with competent refusals. After all, while\ncompetent patients are entitled to refuse any form of medical\ntreatment, they are not entitled to insist on the administration of\nforms of medical treatment that have no prospect of conferring a\nmedical benefit or are not being provided for reasons to do with\nscarcity of medical resources or affordability. While each of these\npoints is sound, it remains the case that medical personnel have a\nduty to relieve suffering when that is within their capacity.\nAccordingly, doctors who regard medical assistance with dying as an\nelement of appropriate medical care will consider it morally\npermissible to agree to a request for assistance with dying by a\ncompetent dying patient who wishes to avoid unnecessary suffering. The\nreason for claiming only that this is morally permissible rather than\nmorally obligatory will be explained in a subsequent paragraph. (For\nfurther reflections on the issue of responses to requests for medical\nassistance see, for instance, Dworkin in Frey, et al. 1998; Sumner\n2011; Young 2017.)\n\nNotwithstanding this response, as was seen earlier, at least some\nproponents of voluntary medically assisted dying wish to question why\nmedical assistance with dying should be restricted to those covered\nby, in particular, the first three conditions set out above in Section\n2. If people\u2019s competent requests for medically assisted death\nshould be respected why impose any restrictions at all on who may have\naccess to medically assisted death? Why, for example, should those\nsuffering from depression, or forms of dementia, not be eligible for\nmedically assisted dying? Most proponents of voluntary medically\nassisted dying hold that there are at least two reasons for\nrestricting access to it to those who satisfy the conditions set out\nearlier (or, a modified set that takes account of the concerns\ncanvassed in the discussion of those proposed conditions). First, they\ncontend that there are political grounds for doing so, namely, that\nbecause legalizing medically assisted dying for competent individuals\nis politically contested, the best hope for its legalization lies in\nfocusing on those forms of suffering most likely to effect law reform.\nThat is why some proponents deny the eligibility even of sufferers\nfrom conditions like \u2018locked-in\u2019 syndrome, motor neurone\ndisease, and multiple sclerosis for voluntary medically assisted dying\nsince, strictly, they are not terminally ill, and reliance has to be\nplaced in consequence on their claim to be suffering unbearably.\nSecond, and relatedly, most proponents of the legalization of medical\nassistance with dying have been cautious about supporting medically\nassisted death for those suffering from, for example, depression and\ndementia, because not only are they not terminally ill, but their\ncompetence to request assistance with dying is apt to be called into\nquestion, particularly in instances where they have given no prior\nindication of their preference for such assistance. Restricting access\nto medical assistance with dying to those whose suffering is less\nlikely to be disputed avoids becoming embroiled in controversy. Some\ncritics of the restrictive approach (e.g., Varelius 2014) take a\nharder line still and claim that it should not even be necessary for a\nperson to be suffering from a medical condition to be eligible for\nmedical assistance with dying; it should be enough to be \u2018tired\nof life\u2019. Only in a few jurisdictions, viz., Switzerland, The\nNetherlands and Belgium, has this issue been seriously broached.\nRegardless of what may happen in those jurisdictions, those seeking\nthe legal provision of medical assistance with dying in other\njurisdictions seem likely to maintain that if such assistance is to be\nseen as a legitimate form of medical care it has to be provided in\nresponse to a medical condition (rather than because someone is\n\u2018tired of life\u2019), and, indeed, restricted to those who\nsatisfy the conditions outlined earlier in Section 2 (or some similar\nset of conditions). In short, these latter hold that making an\nautonomous request for assistance with dying is necessary, but should\nnot be sufficient, for triggering such assistance.\n\nThere is one final matter of relevance to the moral case for voluntary\nmedically assisted death on which comment must be made. The comment\nconcerns a point foreshadowed in a previous paragraph, but it is also\nlinked with the remark just made about the insufficiency of an\nautonomous request for assistance with dying to trigger that\nassistance. It is important to make the point that respect has to be\nshown not only for the dying person\u2019s autonomy but also for the\nprofessional autonomy of any medical personnel asked to lend\nassistance with dying. The value (or, as some would prefer, the right)\nof self-determination does not entitle a patient to try to compel\nmedical professionals to act contrary to their own moral or\nprofessional values. Hence, if voluntary euthanasia is to be legally\npermitted, it must be against a backdrop of respect for professional\nautonomy. Similarly, if a doctor\u2019s view of her moral or\nprofessional responsibilities is at odds with her patient\u2019s\ncompetent request for euthanasia, she should make provision, where it\nis feasible to do so, for the transfer of the patient to the care of a\ndoctor who faces no such conflict. Given that, to date, those who\ncontend that no scope should be permitted for conscientious objection\nwithin medical practice have garnered very little support for that\nview, making use of referrals and transfers remains the most effective\nmeans of resolving such disagreements.\n\nOpponents of voluntary euthanasia have endeavored in a variety of ways\nto counter the very straightforward moral case that has been laid out\nabove for its legalization (see, for example, Keown 2002; Foley, et\nal. 2002; Biggar 2004; Gorsuch 2006). Some of the counter-arguments\nare concerned only with whether the moral case warrants making the\npractice of voluntary euthanasia legal, whereas others are concerned\nwith trying to undermine the moral case itself. In what follows,\nconsideration will be given to the five most important\ncounter-arguments. (For more comprehensive discussions of the morality\nand legality of medically assisted death see Keown 2002; Biggar 2004;\nGorsuch 2006; Young 2007; Sumner 2011.)\n",
