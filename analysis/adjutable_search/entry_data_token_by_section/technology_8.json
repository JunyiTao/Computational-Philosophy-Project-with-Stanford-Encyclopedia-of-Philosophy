    "main_text": "Analytic Philosophy of Technology || Other Topics\n2.6 Other Topics\n\nThere is at least one additional technology-related topic that ought\nto be mentioned because it has created a good deal of analytic\nphilosophical literature, namely Artificial Intelligence and related\nareas. A full discussion of this vast field is beyond the scope of\nthis entry, however. Information is to be found in the entries on\n Turing machines,\n the Church-Turing thesis,\n computability and complexity,\n the Turing test,\n the Chinese room argument,\n the computational theory of mind,\n functionalism,\n multiple realizability, and\n the philosophy of computer science.\n",
