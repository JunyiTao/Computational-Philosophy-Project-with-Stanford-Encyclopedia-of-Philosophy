    "main_text": "Theories of Decolonization and Post-colonial Theory\n5. Theories of Decolonization and Post-colonial Theory\n\nFrantz Fanon was one of the leading theorists of the struggle for\ndecolonization. His two most influential works focused on anti-black\nracism and the impact of colonial violence. Black Skin, White\nMasks (2008 [1952]) describes racialized subjectivity and the\nstructural conditions that sustain racial domination. Drawing on\nexistentialism, psychoanalysis, and literary theory, Fanon\ndemonstrates the constitutive effects of European colonialism on\nidentity. It details the traumatic consequences of immersion in a\ncultural framework that pathologizes blackness, thereby dividing the\nracialized subject. Wretched of the Earth (1961) was the\nmost influential philosophical account of the anti-colonial struggle\nand the challenges of post-colonial governance. The book provides a\ncomplex account of the relationship between violence and liberation.\nViolence is the foundation of the colonial regime, and therefore\ninevitably plays a role in its overthrow, but Fanon also explores its\npsychological dimension. Revolutionary violence can be a productive\nredirection of the internalized violence characteristic of the\nexperience of oppression because it can bring about structural change.\nIt is also a praxis that generates political agency, group cohesion\nand national identity. Wretched of the Earth also includes\nincisive reflections on the way that colonial states continue to exert\neconomic power after independence. According to Fanon, the economic\nexploitation typical of colonialism can be secured in a new way\nthrough the leadership of the comprador bourgeoisie, a segment of the\nindigenous managerial class that is allied with foreign economic\ninterests. He also suggests that collective identity based on\nethnicity or national consciousness can have harmful effects, when it\nfunctions ideologically to mask class differences in service of elite\neconomic interests. Fanon\u2019s Marxist-influenced approach to\nanti-colonial critique is part of a black radical traditional that\nincludes other Caribbean thinkers such as Eric Williams, whose book\nCapitalism and Slavery (1994) demonstrated that the wealth\nextracted from sugar plantations bankrolled the industrial revolution\nand C.L.R James\u2019s The Black Jacobins (1989), which\nretold the story of the Haitian Revolution from the perspective of the\nvictorious revolutionaries. These books were foundational for\ntheories of racial capitalism, a position that holds that racialized\nexploitation and capital accumulation are mutually reinforcing.\n(Robinson 2000)\n\nAnother seminal critic of colonialism is Mahatma Gandhi. He is\nremembered for his leadership of the Indian independence movement, his\ncritique of British colonialism, and his theory of political\nresistance. Among his theoretical innovations is the concept of\nsatyagraha. While the literal meaning is closer to\n\u201cholding on to truth,\u201d the term is often used to describe\nnon-violent resistance or civil disobedience. According to Gandhi, it\nis through the practice of non-cooperation with oppression that the\nforce of truth is animated. The central place of non-violence in\nGandhi\u2019s theory and practice reflects the influence of the Hindu\nconcept ahimsa, or avoiding harm, but this principle was\ntransformed in the context of anti-colonial struggle. Gandhi was a\nprolific writer who was deeply engaged in theoretical and political\ndebates. Among his influential writings was the book Hind\nSwaraj (1997), published in 1909. It takes the form of a dialogue\nbetween a Reader and an Editor. The text provides an account of\nBritish domination in India, an analysis of the meaning of\nswaraj (self-rule), a discussion of political strategy, and a\ncritique of Western civilization. Gandhi denaturalizes \u201cWestern\ncivilization\u201d by showing that the underlying materialism is not\nnormatively justified and the alleged benefits of colonialism (modern\nmedicine, technology) are actually harmful to the human condition. He\nalso shows that the colonists fail in their own terms, pointing out\nthat the European colonists claimed to bring civilization but cemented\ntheir rule by engaging in brutal violence.\n\nContemporary literary theorists have also drawn attention to practices\nof representation that reproduce a logic of subordination that endures\neven after former colonies gain independence. The field of\npostcolonial studies was influenced by Edward Said\u2019s\npath-breaking book Orientalism. In Orientalism Said\napplied Michel Foucault\u2019s technique of discourse analysis to the\nproduction of knowledge about the Middle East. The term orientalism\ndescribed a structured set of concepts, assumptions, and discursive\npractices that were used to produce, interpret, and evaluate knowledge\nabout non-European peoples. Said\u2019s analysis made it possible for\nscholars to deconstruct literary and historical texts in order to\nunderstand how they reflected and reinforced the imperialist project.\nUnlike previous studies that focused on the economic or political\nlogics of colonialism, Said drew attention to the relationship between\nknowledge and power. By foregrounding the cultural and epistemological\nwork of imperialism, Said was able to undermine the ideological\nassumption of value-free knowledge and show that \u201cknowing the\nOrient\u201d was part of the project of dominating it.\nOrientalism can be seen as an attempt to extend the\ngeographical and historical terrain of the poststructuralist critique\nof Western epistemology.\n\nSaid uses the term orientalism in several different ways. First,\norientalism is a specific field of academic study about the Middle\nEast and Asia, albeit one that Said conceives quite expansively to\nencompass history, sociology, literature, anthropology and especially\nphilology. He also identifies it as a practice that helps define\nEurope by creating a stable depiction of its other, its constitutive\noutside. Orientalism is a way of characterizing Europe by drawing a\ncontrasting image or idea, based on a series of binary oppositions\n(rational/irrational, mind/body, order/chaos) that manage and displace\nEuropean anxieties. Finally, Said emphasizes that it is also a mode of\nexercising authority by organizing and classifying knowledge about the\nOrient. This discursive approach is distinct both from the materialist\nview that knowledge is simply a reflection of economic or political\ninterests and from the idealist view that scholarship is disinterested\nand neutral. Following Foucault, Said describes discourse as a form of\nknowledge that is not used instrumentally in service of power but\nrather is itself a form of power.\n\nThe second quasi-canonical contribution to the field of post-colonial\ntheory is Gayatri Spivak\u2019s \u201cCan the Subaltern\nSpeak?\u201d (1988). Spivak works within Said\u2019s problematic of\nrepresentation but extends it to the contemporary academy. Spivak\nquestions the idea of transparent subaltern speech. When well-meaning\nscholars want to let the subaltern \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d\nthey hope that removing the intermediary (the expert, the judge, the\nimperial administrator, the local elite) will enable some authentic\ntruth based on experience to emerge. But experience itself is\nconstituted through representation; therefore denying the problem of\nrepresentation does not make it go away but only makes it harder to\nrecognize. The central claim of the essay is that\n\u201crepresentation has not withered away.\u201d Since power is\neverywhere, even in language itself, transparency and authenticity are\nimpossible; this means that the messy and controversial work of\ninterpretation is necessary.\n\nAijaz Ahmad has argued that, despite Spivak\u2019s claims to be\nworking within the Marxist tradition, her essays exhibit contempt for\nmaterialism, rationalism, and progress, the core features of Marxism\n(Ahmad 1997). According to Ahmad, Spivak is concerned with narratives\nof capitalism rather than the institutional structures and material\neffects of capitalism as a mode of production. Spivak\u2019s sharp\ncriticism of movements that essentialize subaltern subjects casts\ndoubt on the basic premise of Marxist politics, which privileges the\nproletariat as a group with shared, true interests that are produced\nby the capitalist system.\n\nVivek Chibber (2013) and Dipesh Chakrabarty (2007) have taken up these\nissues. In his influential book Provincializing Europe,\nChakrabarty argues that distinctively European concepts such as\ndisenchanted space, secular time, and sovereignty inform the social\nsciences. When these standards are treated as universal, the third\nworld is seen as incomplete or lacking. Chibber challenges the\nposition. Chibber advances a critique of Subaltern Studies and defends\nuniversal categories such as capitalism, class, rationality, and\nobjectivity. He argues that these categories need not be reductionist\nor Eurocentric and that they are useful in illuminating the motivation\nof political actors and the structural constraints faced by leaders in\ncountries such as India.\n\nThis debate reflects a tension that runs through the field of\npostcolonial studies. Although some thinkers draw on both Marxism and\npoststructuralism, the two theories have different goals, methods, and\nassumptions. In the humanities, postcolonial theory tends to reflect\nthe influence of poststructuralist thought, while theorists of\ndecolonization focus on social history, economics, and political\ninstitutions. Whereas postcolonial theory is associated with the\nissues of hybridity, diaspora, representation, narrative, and\nknowledge/power, theories of decolonization are concerned with\nrevolution, economic inequality, violence, and political identity.\n\nSome scholars have begun to question the usefulness of the concept\npost-colonial theory. Like the idea of the Scottish four-stages\ntheory, a theory with which it would appear to have little in common,\nthe very concept of post-colonialism seems to rely on a progressive\nunderstanding of history (McClintock 1992). It suggests, perhaps\nunwittingly, that the core concepts of hybridity, alterity,\nparticularity, and multiplicity may lead to a kind of methodological\ndogmatism or developmental logic. Moreover, the term\n\u201ccolonial\u201d as a marker of this domain of inquiry is also\nproblematic in so far as it suggests historically implausible\ncommonalities across territories that experienced very different\ntechniques of domination. Thus, the critical impulse behind\npost-colonial theory has turned on itself, drawing attention to the\nway that it may itself be marked by the utopian desire to transcend\nthe trauma of colonialism (Gandhi 1998).\n",
