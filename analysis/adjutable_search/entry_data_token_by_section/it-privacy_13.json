    "main_text": "How can information technology itself solve privacy concerns? || Privacy enhancing technologies\n3.2 Privacy enhancing technologies\n\nA growing number of software tools are available that provide some\nform of privacy (usually anonymity) for their users, such tools are\ncommonly known as privacy enhancing technologies (Danezis &\nG\u00fcrses 2010, Other Internet Resources). Examples include\ncommunication-anonymizing tools such as Tor (Dingledine, Mathewson,\n& Syverson 2004) and Freenet (Clarke et al. 2001), and\nidentity-management systems for which many commercial software\npackages exist (see below). Communication anonymizing tools allow\nusers to anonymously browse the web (with Tor) or anonymously share\ncontent (Freenet). They employ a number of cryptographic techniques\nand security protocols in order to ensure their goal of anonymous\ncommunication. Both systems use the property that numerous users use\nthe system at the same time which provides k-anonymity (Sweeney\n2002): no individual can be uniquely distinguished from a group of\nsize k, for large values for k. Depending on the system,\nthe value of k can vary between a few hundred to hundreds of\nthousands. In Tor, messages are encrypted and routed along numerous\ndifferent computers, thereby obscuring the original sender of the\nmessage (and thus providing anonymity). Similarly, in Freenet content\nis stored in encrypted form from all users of the system. Since users\nthemselves do not have the necessary decryption keys, they do not know\nwhat kind of content is stored, by the system, on their own computer.\nThis provides plausible deniability and privacy. The system can at any\ntime retrieve the encrypted content and send it to different Freenet\nusers.\n\nPrivacy enhancing technologies also have their downsides. For example,\nTor, the tool that allows anonymized communication and browsing over\nthe Internet, is susceptible to an attack whereby, under certain\ncircumstances, the anonymity of the user is no longer guaranteed\n(Back, M\u00f6ller, & Stiglic 2001; Evans, Dingledine, &\nGrothoff 2009). Freenet (and other tools) have similar problems\n(Douceur 2002). Note that for such attacks to work, an attacker needs\nto have access to large resources that in practice are only realistic\nfor intelligence agencies of countries. However, there are other\nrisks. Configuring such software tools correctly is difficult for the\naverage user, and when the tools are not correctly configured\nanonymity of the user is no longer guaranteed. And there is always the\nrisk that the computer on which the privacy-preserving software runs\nis infected by a Trojan horse (or other digital pest) that monitors\nall communication and knows the identity of the user.\n\nAnother option for providing anonymity is the anonymization of data\nthrough special software. Tools exist that remove patient names and\nreduce age information to intervals: the age 35 is then represented as\nfalling in the range 30\u201340. The idea behind such anonymization\nsoftware is that a record can no longer be linked to an individual,\nwhile the relevant parts of the data can still be used for scientific\nor other purposes. The problem here is that it is very hard to\nanonymize data in such a way that all links with an individual are\nremoved and the resulting anonymized data is still useful for research\npurposes. Researchers have shown that it is almost always possible to\nreconstruct links with individuals by using sophisticated statistical\nmethods (Danezis, Diaz, & Troncoso 2007) and by combining multiple\ndatabases (Anderson 2008) that contain personal information.\nTechniques such as k-anonymity might also help to generalize\nthe data enough to make it unfeasible to de-anonymize data (LeFevre et\nal. 2005).\n",
