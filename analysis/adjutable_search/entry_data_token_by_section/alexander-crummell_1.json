American slavery created a class of forced laborers\nwho possessed few legal rights. And while exceptions existed, the\ngeneral path to slavery was through the trans-Atlantic slave trade,\nvirtually ensuring that slaves were blacks. But rights in any of their\nsenses\u2014legal, political, or even moral\u2014are far subtler than a casual\nobserver might grasp. Let us call this the Problem of Civil Rights.\n\nThe Problem of Civil Rights concerns the question whether\nblacks (ought to) enjoy legally established guarantees, together with\ncorresponding obligations on the State. In the American federal legal\nsystem, this bifurcates\u2014importantly, it turns out\u2014into legal\nguarantees by and obligations on the federal government, and those by\nand on the several states.\n\n\nThe Civil Rights Problem arises directly for blacks who are slaves.\nGiven that they are explicitly referred to in the U.S. Constitution in\nterms of their status as forced laborers rather than in terms of\nmembership as citizens in civil society (see Article IV, for instance),\nthe courts have tended to interpret their legal rights in extremely\nnarrow terms. It will not be sufficient to merely argue, as some might\nbe tempted, that the curtailment of legal rights for blacks is\narbitrary and hence unfair. The Constitutional language (and\ncorresponding intent) is important and not easily dismissed. Moreover,\ncommon law approaches to labor and slave property in international\ncontexts is complex and sometimes conflicting, so clarity will be\ndifficult to achieve.\n\n\nOne hope may be to exploit the dualistic character of American\ncitizenship: inhabitants of individual states are regarded as legal\ncitizens of that state by the rules and customs of that state, and\n(separately) are regarded as citizens of the Union. If a free state\nwanted to confer citizenship and the legal rights that accrue to that\nstatus on blacks, it may do so without the interference of federal\nstatute. (Of course, the same goes for slave states.) As a theoretical\nmatter Crummell could take the approach that some freedom, if\nachievable, could provide a prima facie justification for\nbroad expansion later, leaving to the political strategists the actual\nimplementation of that expansion.\n\n\nHowever, a dizzying series of Supreme Court opinions\u2014the\nAntelope (1825), the Amistad (1841), Groves v.\nSlaughter (1841), Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842), and\nStrader v. Graham (1850)\u2014culminating in the Dred Scott\nopinion (1856) helped undermine that theoretical approach. These cases\neach helped clarify the legal scope of black civil rights, in a way\ngenerally unfavorable to blacks. The rebellion on the Amistad\nwould have led to restoring kidnapped black Africans to their purported\nSpanish owners if narrow questions of international treaty obligations\nhad been read differently. The slave status of blacks was not affected\nby their transient residence in a free state, as was held in\nStrader. Fugitive slaves were presumed to be subject to\nreturn, as the Court held in Prigg, despite the somewhat\nweaker obligation of states to carry out the requisite extraditions.\nThe difficulty presented by this series of opinions is well captured by\nthe Court's interpretation of fugitive slave laws, and shows the\nheadwind against Crummell.\n\n\nIt is historically well known that the object in the clause in the\nConstitution of the United States relating to persons owing service and\nlabor in one state escaping into other states was to secure to the\ncitizens of the slaveholding States the complete right and title of\nownership in their slaves as property in every State in the Union into\nwhich they might escape from the State where they were held in\nservitude. The full recognition of this right and title was\nindispensable to the security of this species of property in all the\nslaveholding States, and indeed was so vital to the preservation of\ntheir domestic interests and institutions that it cannot be doubted\nthat it constituted a fundamental article without the adoption of which\nthe Union could not have been formed. Its true design was to guard\nagainst the doctrines and principles prevailing in the non-slaveholding\nStates by preventing them from intermeddling with or obstructing or\nabolishing the rights of the owners of slaves. (Prigg v.\nPennsylvania, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 539 (1842), at 540)\n\n\n\nIt is clear that, on this legal interpretation of the Constitution,\nthe civil rights of blacks are fundamentally incompatible with the\nproperty rights of citizens, as long as slavery is legal anywhere.\nWritten by Chief Justice Taney on the eve of the Civil War, the\nopinion in Scott v. Sandford (1856)\u2014the Dred Scott\ncase\u2014provides a most dramatic version of the narrow\nconstitutional reading of black legal rights. The Negro has no\nrights a white man is bound to respect, Taney famously concluded,\nand thus Dred and Harriet Scott, two slaves suing for their freedom,\nwere ruled ineligible to bring that suit before the Court. Moreover,\nthe problem was not confined to enslaved blacks. Not only did Taney\nconclude that blacks were not citizens, he held that they would not be\ncitizens even if freed. And no individual state could by extending\nlegal rights to blacks make them citizens of the Union proper. These\nholdings helped shut down several promising argument strategies\navailable to Crummell.\n\n\nCrummell's early thought in the 1840s began to respond to these\ngathering philosophical pressures on the notion of black civil rights.\nHe reasoned that if arguments in favor of rights were partial to\nblacks or otherwise based on the local conditions of black Americans,\nthen those civil rights would be subject to future retraction on\nsimilarly partial or consequentialist grounds. And in any case, public\nsympathy can be volatile and unreliable, setting up backlashes. Such\nshaky ground for legal rights for blacks would be disastrous. In\nparticular, though black service to the country created\n\u201cfavorable considerations\u201d for the wider acceptance of\ntheir demands for justice, it remained an insufficient and\n\u201cuntenable\u201d justification (Crummell, \u201cNew York\nConvention Address,\u201d 202). \u201cWe object to others placing\nour rights upon complexion,\u201d he explained, so \u201c[w]e\nourselves [should] not lay our claims to consideration on this or any\nsimilar ground.\u201d Only a general, rational solution can provide a\n\u201cjust and impartial guarantee\u201d of such civil rights as\nthose protecting voting (201). Notice that Crummell is not making the\nmerely political point that rights ought not be based on the\npartiality that the public (and its duly elected representatives in\nlegislatures) might extend to blacks. He's making the stronger logical\ncase that it's the nature of rights to be non-partial.\n\n\nThis is the driving force of his positive solution to the Problem of\nCivil Rights\u2014call it the Natural Rights\nArgument\u2014which begins by asserting that rights exist, and\nnot merely in the conventional or partial sense of public\nsympathy. They have a \u201chigher origin\u201d and a \u201cpurer\nbirth,\u201d as much in the sense of logical priority as in the sense\nof metaphysical independence. That is, Crummell takes the Problem of\nCivil Rights to require for its solution an appeal to rights as\nexisting prior to and independent of the legal environment in which\nsuch rights are contested and adjudicated.\n\n\nTo take the Amistad as an example, we might give a\nconventional, partial view of rights as taking them to be supported by\nthe sympathies of reasonable and empathetic onlookers. On that\nreading, Cinque and the other Africans who rose up and killed many of\ntheir captors had a right of self-defense, as well as a right to have\ntheir case heard in court, given the appalling circumstance of their\nkidnapping. Surely, any American would protest in just the same way if\ncaptured, and no one would think it too extreme to use whatever force\nwas required to resist kidnapping. But a reading based on a natural\nview of rights, the sort Crummell is urging, would make much of the\nfact that the right to self-defense, especially by non-Americans in\nAmerican waters, is one that attaches to persons, and not merely\ncitizens, and so is a right that pre-exists rights granted by\nlaw. Indeed, it is the obligation of law to properly capture any such\npre-existing rights from what a number of philosophers regard as our\n\u201cnatural state.\u201d The decision might have turned out the\nsame, but the reasoning would be different.\n\n\nThe second step in Crummell's Natural Rights Argument holds that\nrights may be inferred from the \u201csettled and primary\nsentiments\u201d of human nature as well as from the \u201coriginal\ngrounds of high dignities\u201d and \u201cexalted tendencies\u201d\nof our common humanity (\u201cNew York\nConvention Address,\u201d 201). This is an important part of his reasoning, in\nthat rights are not merely abstract principles applied to human\naffairs, but are derivable from our passionate and emotional\nnatures. In the previous century Hume made much of the textured moral\npersonality in his discussion of the nature of action in\nsociety. Though he would certainly not endorse Crummell's advocacy of\nnatural rights in this discussion, he would surely admire his appeal\nto the sentiments of human nature as a ground for legal and political\naction. Hume was a great champion of emotion and\npassion\u2014\u201csentiments,\u201d in that era's idiom\u2014as part of the\nrationalizing of what we do. It is not that we can subordinate our\nactions to reason; it is that our reason can grasp what we do from our\nemotional nature and come to understand and make sense of it. Crummell\nsees this as an important part of his account.\n\n\nIn that way the Amistad supports a fuller interpretation\nthan might otherwise be available. Recall that on the conventional,\npartial reading, the justification for African self-defense is from\npublic sympathy for their actions. Crummell's natural rights reading\nnot only corrects that idea so that the law ought to bend to\npre-existing self-defense rights, but that those rights are inferable\nfrom our sentimental nature provides a corollary explanation of\nprecisely why public sympathy arises at all. There is little that\nnineteenth-century Americans would understand about newly arrived\nAfricans on a slave ship; they do not share language, religion, or much\nof anything else. But the deeply human response to an absurd,\ndangerous\u2014and so clearly wrong\u2014circumstance arouses in each\nof us the passion that was stirred in Cinque. Our sympathy arises, not\nas a condition of right, but as a consequence of it.\n\n\nThe third step in the Natural Rights Argument holds that any being\nendowed with the \u201clight of reason\u201d that exercises the\nvarious \u201cexalted attributes\u201d of reason possesses certain\npeculiar rights on the \u201cground of their nature.\u201d This\nexplicit confidence in the powers of reason that drives the argument\nis important to Crummell, and is the main reason he and Hume do not\ntravel far together in this discussion. But Crummell needs this sort\nof rationalistic account, given that reason is our faculty for\ndiscovering such logical connections as that between circumstantial\nfact and abstract right, making it essential to the inferences that\njustify that right in human affairs. It is one thing to observe that\nsuch-and-such is the case, as one might in reviewing the facts of\nthe Amistad case. But it is quite another to articulate a\npre-existing right, abstract at least in the sense that it requires\ncalling up, even if (as Crummell claims) it has a basis in our\nsentimental nature. Presumably one needs the ability to reflect on\ngeneral principles of action, surely a subtle rational power, as well\nas the reasoning required to apply such reflection to the facts\nobserved. Such coordinated thinking and observing could then be\nbrought to cases such as the Amistad, where one could argue\nthat the general principle that holds that self-defense is permissible\napplies to these very facts.\n\n\nCrummell's concept of reason is thus both natural (in that\nit's derived from our natural state, pre-existing the law) and\ncategorical (in that it is to be applied to those facts and\ncircumstances that come under it, independent of political\ncontingencies), and so ought not be jeopardized by the kind of\ncontingent appeals made by adherents of conventional and partial\nviews.\n\n\nHis first line of defense of the Natural Rights Argument is positive,\nwhile his second is negative. The argument only succeeds if blacks in\nfact count as an instance of its third step, the generalization about\nbeings who are endowed with the light of reason.  His positive defense\nbegins by asserting that blacks \u201care men,\u201d an obvious\nclaim that is certainly necessary yet insufficient to ground the\nargument. One can easily see this by noticing that a racist might\npresume that some men are unequal for being less rational, due to\ntheir race; hence more reasons are needed. Crummell thus offers what\nmay be called a Common Sympathies Premise, asserting that\nblack political sympathies \u201chave the same being and\nnature\u201d as those in any other group (\u201cNew York\nConvention Address,\u201d 202). His thinking is that\nblacks have the same kinds of beliefs about political circumstances\nand desires about political interests and outcomes as any group\nwould. The inference is clear, and blacks are not only men (and\nwomen), but are men (and women) endowed with reason. Hence, blacks do\nindeed count as an instance of step one.\n\n\nThe argument is negatively supported by black disfranchisement, that\npolitical circumstance in which blacks were denied the right to vote.\nDisfranchisement shows that both the rights-are-inferable and\nthe rights-are-real-and-impartial premises to be violated in\nthe case of black Americans. The First Disfranchisement\nPremise states that the disfranchised condition of blacks creates\nthe \u201cyearnings and longings for the exercise of political\nprerogatives, that are the product of the adaptedness of man's social\nnature to political arrangements, striv[ing] with irrepressible\npotency within us\u201d (\u201cNew York\nConvention Address,\u201d 202). Black reactions to political power\n\u201cnot proceeding from, yet operating upon\u201d them play out as\nthey would for any population in a subordinated state, implying their\ncommon humanity. The idea behind this claim is that the negative\nreaction blacks have to the curtailment of their legal rights is\nsimilar to how any group in that circumstance would feel and react;\nhence we have another (admittedly negative) reason to take them as\nrational beings.\n\n\nThe Second Disfranchisement Premise argues from\ndisfranchisement to the \u201cindignities and wrongs\u201d resulting\ntherefrom; the \u201caccumulated potency\u201d of these wrongs\ngenerates \u201can increase and intenseness of proscription,\u201d\nillustrating how human nature's \u201clegitimate exercises\u201d are\n\u201chindered\u201d (\u201cNew York Convention Address,\u201d 203). In making this point Crummell shows,\nagain, that blacks are reacting to their difficult legal and political\ncircumstance. But this time theirs is a kind of moral discomfort, an\nintense sense that a wrong is being perpetrated against them. If he is\nright, he has once again supported the Natural Rights Argument's third\npremise by showing that blacks are reasonable and hence full members\nof civil society.\n\n\nOn a first read the Disfranchisement Premises appear to presuppose\nthe conclusion they aim to show. They appeal to the effects of wrongs\nto make the case that blacks are fully human, and hence ought to have\ntheir civil rights protected. But whether the treatment of blacks\ncounts as a wrong is the very question at issue. Of course, in\ncontemporary legal contexts the issue doesn't even get started, since\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth amendments (ratified after the Civil War)\nprohibit the denial of civil rights to blacks. During the slavery era,\nthough, that point faced a stiff legal headwind, especially in\nslavery-related cases argued before the Supreme Court, and so positive\narguments needed to be produced.\n\n\nOne less-than-satisfying way to avoid this fallacy is to read the two\nPremises conditionally: if blacks enjoy full moral status, then\ndisfranchisement counts as a wrong, particularly given the\npsychological evidence of the First Disfranchisement\nPremise. This kind of reading simply takes the wrongness of\ndisfranchisement as a consequence of the condition that\nblacks are rational beings in the sense required for membership in\nsociety. That gives the argument a bit more nuance, since technically\nCrummell is not asserting that blacks have that status; he would\nsimply be supposing, as if for the sake of argument, that they do, but\nthen showing that, if they do, then the psychological state of blacks\ncounts as a harm. The problem with this reading is that it offers no\nmore than what any conditional logical proof can offer\u2014support\nfor the conditional in question\u2014when what one really seeks is\nsupport for the antecedent as well. It may be that the connection\nbetween condition and consequence is made, but what we really want is\nsome reason to think that the condition has indeed been satisfied in\nthe case of blacks. It is easy to construct, for instance, a\npaternalistic counter-argument on which black discomfort with their\ndisfranchisement results from exposure to abolitionist opinions. On\nthat reasoning, the obvious solution is to limit the exposure rather\nthan grant blacks the right to vote\u2014an obviously dissatisfying\nconclusion, to say the least.\n\n\nA better gloss is to take the Second Disfranchisement Premise as an\nanalysis of the First: it is not merely that blacks are\npsychologically harmed by their disfranchised status, but that they\nunderstand their psychological response to political marginality as a\nmoral wrong. Hence they respond not merely to the fact of their\npolitical weakness, but also to the denial it represents of their moral\ncharacter and efficacy qua moral. This route is more robust,\nsince it recognizes in blacks a complex moral interpretation of the\nharm they are suffering, which presupposes the condition the\nearlier rendering could only stipulate. That presupposition is\nvirtuous, though, since the psychological facts in question are\nverifiable, and if they hold, they directly establish the moral status\nin question. Moreover, paternalism is forestalled, since a moral\njudgment by blacks of their own condition counts as prima\nfacie evidence that they are moral agents capable of such\njudgments.\n\n\nCrummell's conclusion follows directly, and black Americans are\njustified in claiming \u201cequal and entire rights\u201d with other\ncitizens \u201con the ground of our common humanity\u201d\n(\u201cNew York Convention Address,\u201d 203).\n\n\nThe Natural Rights Argument is bold and brisk in the way a young\nthinker's first serious foray into moral argument is apt to be. While\nsomewhat programmatic, it nevertheless provides the logical framework\nhe needs to address moral questions about blacks. Surely they are owed\na remedy for civil-rights violations if they are the proper bearers of\nsuch rights, for instance. And they would presumably forfeit any such\nremedy if they expatriated to Africa, Canada, or Europe, places many\nactivists were urging them to resettle to. Hence the value of his\nreasoning for practical responses to problems in black life. However,\nthe argument runs up several philosophical debts. First, is the moral\nreasoning by which rights are justified some special precinct of a more\ngeneral kind of reasoning? What does this show about the metaphysical\nbasis of normative concepts? Second, the Crummellian moral philosopher\nowes the reader an account of human nature, since rights are inferred\nfrom it. Moreover, both the Common Sympathies Premise and the\nDisfranchisement Premises turn on some broader psychology of agency.\nWhat does that look like? And third, how can the timeless character of\nmoral concepts like rights be reconciled with the evolving character of\nthe human condition\u2014the progress from slavery to freedom, for\ninstance? Much of Crummell's more mature moral philosophy attempts to\npay these debts; they are discussed in turn below.\n",
