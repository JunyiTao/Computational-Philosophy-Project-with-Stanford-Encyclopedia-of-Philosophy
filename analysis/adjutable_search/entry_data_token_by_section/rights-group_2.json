    "main_text": "Groups as right-holders\n3. Groups as right-holders\n\nNo-one ascribes rights promiscuously to every kind of group, so what\nmakes a group the kind of group that might bear rights? For many\ntheorists an essential condition is the integrity it manifests: a\ngroup must surmount a threshold of unity and identity as a group if it\nis to be capable of bearing rights.\n\nThus Peter French (1984, 5\u201318) distinguishes between\n\u201caggregate collectivities\u201d and \u201cconglomerate\ncollectivities\u201d. An aggregate collectivity is a mere collection\nof individuals such as a crowd or the people standing at a bus stop or\na statistical category such as middle-income earners. If we were to\nascribe either moral responsibility or moral rights to an aggregate,\nthose would be reducible, without remainder, to the responsibilities\nand rights of the several individuals who made up the aggregate. A\nconglomerate collectivity, by contrast, has a unified being since it\nis formally constituted as an organization with an internal structure,\nrules, offices and decision-procedures. (For a similar, but not\nidentical, distinction between aggregates and organizations, see Copp\n1984.) French\u2019s examples of conglomerates include the Democratic\nParty, the US Congress, the US army, the Red Cross, university\nfaculties and business corporations. Organizations of this sort have\nidentities that are not exhausted by those of the persons in them; one\nperson\u2019s leaving and another\u2019s joining does not yield a new\norganization. Thus, \u201cwhat is predicable of a conglomerate is not\nnecessarily predicable of all of those or any of those individuals\nassociated with it\u201d (1984, 13), including the rights and\nresponsibilities we might ascribe to the conglomerate. French does not\ndeny that the individuals in a conglomerate, such as a business\ncorporation, will have rights and responsibilities relating to its\nactivities; he denies only that the rights and responsibilities of the\nconglomerate can be distributed without remainder amongst those\nindividuals. Thus, if the Gulf Oil Corporation buys or sells property,\nor joins a cartel, or is found causally responsible for environmental\npollution and held morally responsible for cleaning it up, the\nCorporation as agent and as patient is not reducible to the\nindividuals who are currently associated with it.\n\nDwight Newman (2011, 4) distinguishes in a similar fashion between\n\u201csets\u201d and \u201ccollectivities\u201d. A set, like\nFrench\u2019s aggregate, becomes a different set each time its membership\nchanges. A collectivity, by contrast, remains identifiable as the same\ncollectivity even though its membership changes. For both French and\nNewman, a group\u2019s having an identity that survives changes in its\nmembership is essential to its being the kind of group that might bear\nrights. (See also Graham 2002, 68\u20139; List and Pettit 2011,\n31\u201332; Van Dyke 1977.)\n\nThe phenomenon of a group\u2019s having an identity and existence that is\nseparate from its members is most readily apparent in the case of\nformally organised groups. So, for example, we can think of a football\nclub or a university department or a trade union as remaining the same\nfootball club, university department or trade union, even though the\nindividuals who constitute its members change over time. When you or I\njoin or leave a formally constituted organisation, there is something\nindependent of ourselves that we join or leave. Thus, if we ascribe\nrights to a formally constituted group, the right-bearing group will\nbe something other than the set of individuals who happen to belong to\nit at any moment.\n\nFormal organization may not be deemed essential to a group\u2019s having an\nirreducible and enduring identity. Nations, for example, are often\nconceived as entities whose identities run across successive\ngenerations of nationals. A nation\u2019s historic entitlement to a\nparticular territory would typically be conceived as the entitlement\nof a single enduring entity rather than a right inherited and\nbequeathed by successive generations of nationals so that,\nhistorically, no temporally continuous entity has possessed rights\nover the territory. People are given to thinking of nations in this\nunitary and enduring fashion even in cases, such as the Kurds, where a\nnation has not been instantiated in a state, or the Poles, where the\nnation has been deprived of political independence for lengthy periods\nof its history. Whether we conceive a group as having an identity and\nbeing that supersedes that of its members turns not just on what we\nfind in the world, but also on how we see it.\n\nFor some proponents of group rights, we should look for the integrity\nessential for right-bearing neither in the group\u2019s internal\norganization nor in its objective characteristics but in its\nsubjectivity. What matters is that the individuals who make up the\ngroup feel themselves strongly bound together as members of a group\nwith which they identify. Marlies Galenkamp holds that a right-holding\ngroup must possess a strong form of intra-group solidarity and be the\nkind of group that communitarians describe as a constitutive community\n(1993, 81\u2013100, 111\u20132, 131; see also Segesvary 1995).\nMichael McDonald (1991) argues that it is a shared understanding\namongst individuals that they are normatively bound to each other that\nmakes them a group for moral purposes. That shared understanding may\nbe related to and promoted by shared objective characteristics, such\nas a common history, language, system of belief or social condition,\nbut it is still the subjectivity of the group rather than those\nobjective features that is crucial to its being a right-bearing group.\nLarry May (1987) and Paul Sheehy (2006, 151\u2013173) also find the\nsource of a group\u2019s moral status in the interrelatedness of its\nmembers, but argue those interrelationships are significant for the\ncommon interests and needs to which they give rise.\n\nA significant measure of unity and identity might then be essential\nfor a group\u2019s being the kind of group that can bear rights but, if it\nis, that condition would seem necessary rather than sufficient. Those\nwho question the very idea of group rights do not deny that groups\ncome in different forms or that some exhibit a high degree of unity or\nthat groups can be very important in people\u2019s lives. They deny only\nthat we have reason to ascribe groups, however unified and however\nsignificant, the moral properties they must possess if they are to be\nindependent right-holders. So where do proponents of group rights find\nthose properties?\n\nPhilosophical analyses of rights have been dominated by two rival\ntheories. One is the choice or will theory according to which to have\na right is to possess a choice (e.g. Hart 1982; Steiner 1998). On that\ntheory, rights can be possessed only by beings capable of choice. If\nwe take the case of claim-rights (rights that impose corresponding\nduties upon others), those rights should be ascribed only to beings\ncapable of exercising control over the performance of the\ncorresponding duties. We can possess rights only if we are capable of\nexercising them.\n\nThe other theory is the interest or benefit theory for which the\ncrucial feature of a right lies in its providing for the\nright-holder\u2019s interest or benefit (e.g. Kramer 1998; Lyons 1969). If\nwe take the case of claim-rights again, those rights can be ascribed\nto the beings at whose interests the corresponding duties are\ndirected, irrespective of whether the right-bearer is able to control\nthe performance of those duties. Of course, not every interest will\ngenerate a right and interest theorists usually therefore propose more\ndiscriminating versions of the theory. David Lyons (1969, 176), for\nexample, provides that someone has a claim-right only if they are the\n\u201cdirect, intended beneficiary\u201d of another\u2019s duty. In\nanother much-used formulation, Joseph Raz (1986, 166) holds that X has\na right \u201cif and only if X can have rights, and, other things\nbeing equal, an aspect of X\u2019s well-being (his interest) is a\nsufficient reason for holding some other person(s) to be under a\nduty\u201d.\n\nIn conformity with these rival theories, some accounts of group rights\nemphasize a group\u2019s capacity for choice or, as it is more commonly\ndescribed, its capacity for \u201cagency\u201d as the crucial test\nof its capacity to possess rights, while others focus upon the group\u2019s\ncapacity to possess interests as a group.\n\nA capacity for agency is central to the ascription of rights to groups\nin the accounts of Peter French (1984, 1995) and Christian List and\nPhilip Pettit (2011). French argues that we have reason to ascribe\nsome groups the moral agency and moral personality that we ordinarily\nascribe to human individuals. If a group is to be a moral agent, it\nmust be capable of intentional action as a group; it must be able to\nhave purposes, plans, goals and interests that motivate its conduct.\nIt must also be capable of making rational decisions about its\nintentions and of responding to events and ethical criticism by\nadjusting its intentions and behaviour as those bear upon others\n(1995, 10-12). Conglomerate groups, such as business corporations,\nwhich possess internal decision structures and expressly formulated\npolicies, can meet those conditions. That suffices to make them both\nmoral group agents and \u201cfull-fledged moral persons\u201d\nequipped with moral responsibilities and moral rights. They are\nproperly accorded \u201cwhatever privileges, rights and duties as\nare, in the normal course of affairs, accorded to all members of the\nmoral community\u201d (1984, 32).\n\nFor List and Pettit (2011) a group can be an agent if it has\nrepresentational states, so that it can form beliefs, and motivational\nstates so that it can possess desires. It must also be capable of\nprocessing and acting on its beliefs and desires and of attaining a\nminimal level of rationality, particularly consistency, in the way its\nattitudes connect with one another and with its environment. Organized\ngroups, such as states, churches, commercial corporations and\nvoluntary associations, can, they argue, satisfy those conditions and\nso be agents. The attitudes formed by such groups supervene on those\nof their individual members but are not reducible to those of their\nmembers. A group can therefore possess agency as a group.\n\nThe specific case that List and Pettit make for group agency is\nepistemological rather than ontological and cannot be reproduced here.\nAgency alone, however, does not make the case for group rights. A\nrobot could be an agent but it would not bear rights since it would\nnot possess the sort of agency required for personhood. List and\nPettit adopt a \u201cperformative\u201d conception of personhood,\naccording to which being a person turns on what an entity can do\nrather than the stuff of which it is made. To be a person is to be\n\u201can agent who can perform effectively in the space of\nobligations\u201d (173). It is to be capable of participating in a\nsystem of conventions, such as a system of law, in which the\nparticipator contracts and honours obligations to others and derives\nentitlements from the obligations of others. Group agents possess that\nnormative capability and so should be accounted persons. As persons,\nthey can and should be held morally responsible for their actions and\nbe credited with rights, albeit fewer rights than we should ascribe to\nnatural human persons (on which, see section 7 below).\n\nMaking group agency a necessary condition for group right-holding\nsignificantly limits the range of groups that might possess rights.\nAdina Preda (2012), for example, an adherent of the choice theory,\nholds that only organized groups equipped with collective\ndecision-procedures can possess rights since only they are capable of\nintentional action as groups. Groups that lack those structures, such\nas ethnic or linguistic groups, may have members who possess\nindividual rights relating to their group characteristics, but the\ngroups of which they are members will not possess rights as\ngroups.\n\nThose who subscribe to the interest theory of rights can view the\nrange of groups that might possess rights much more generously. Thus\nKeith Graham points out (2002, 89\u201393) that a group does not have\nto be a moral agent to be a moral patient or to be treated more or\nless justly or to flourish more or less well. Similarly for May\n(1987), McDonald (1991) and Sheehy (2006) the critical consideration\nis that a group can have interests as a group that are more than the\naggregated interests of its individual members. That renders groups\ncapable of being harmed or of being treated unjustly as groups and\ntherefore suitable candidates for rights.\n\nThe most developed and sophisticated interest-based account of group\nrights has come from Dwight Newman. For Newman (2011, Part I) groups\nthat constitute right-bearing \u201ccollectivities\u201d can range\nfrom corporations and churches to cultural groups and hockey teams. A\ncollectivity is distinguished by the central values to which it is\ncommitted and by a structure which defines its membership and marks it\noff from other groups. Its members are essential to its existence, but\nthe collectivity is no mere aggregation of its members. Rather, it\nsupervenes on its members. It supervenes on their existence but also\non their relationships with one another and their beliefs about those\nrelationships. Supervenience does not imply reducibility; neither the\nexistence of the collectivity, nor its actions or intentions, can be\nreduced to those of its individual members. For Newman a collectivity\nhas moral status as a collectivity. It can therefore bear moral rights\nand moral responsibilities as a collectivity. It can also have\ninterests, which are other than the aggregated interests of its\nmembers; those interests will lie in whatever makes the collectivity\u2019s\nlife go better as a collectivity. In conformity with Raz\u2019s conception\nof rights, a group\u2019s interests will generate rights whenever they are\nof sufficient importance to justify the ascription of duties to\nothers.\n\nMiodrag Jovanovi\u0107 (2012) provides another interest-based account\nof group rights but of a rather different sort. Current international\nand domestic systems of law ascribe rights to groups, such as rights of\nself-determination and rights designed to protect their cultures.\nJovanovi\u0107 seeks to explicate those rights by uncovering the\n\u201cnormative moral standpoint\u201d implicit in them. That\nstandpoint, which he himself endorses, is, he argues,\n\u201cvalue-collectivism\u201d: \u201cthe view that collective\nentities can have inherent value, which is independent of its\ncontribution to the well-being of individual members\u201d (2012, 6).\nIn other words, we should understand the legal rights attributed to a\ngroup as grounded in the irreducibly collective value of the group, a\nvalue that is not reducible to the value of the group for the several\nindividuals who constitute its members. Jovanovi\u0107 does not\nascribe those rights to every sort of group recognised in law. In\nparticular, he does not ascribe them to juristic persons, such as\nbusiness corporations and trade unions. Rather, he ascribes them only\nto groups that possess a pre-legal existence and identity, such as\nnational, ethnic, linguistic and religious groups. It is the\nirreducibly collective interests of those groups that, on his account,\nlegal group rights should aim to protect and promote.\n",
