The existence of a thing is\nassociated with its perfected form in the future. In this sense, the\nafterlife is merely a relative concept. As we have seen, it is the\nintellect and the faculty of imagination that are the distinguishing\nfeatures that constitute individual survival. Contrary to most\nphilosophers before him, matter is not the principle of individuation\nand therefore individual identity and personhood can exist divorced\nfrom matter, and the soul is immaterial, as are the bodies of the\nafterlife (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, IX: 311).\n\nOne\u2019s existence is a process of reversion to the One, an\nunfolding of becoming that progresses from our corporeal incipience\nwith the body through the perfection of the soul that gradually\njettisons the physical body of this world in search of the beatitude\nand ecstasy of the intelligible world and of the afterlife (Mulla\nSadra 2001\u20135, IX: 164). The existence of the afterlife is more\nsubtle, more perfect and closer to the One. The pleasures and pains of\nthe afterlife that are scripturally discussed are primarily spiritual\nand intelligible although they retain an attachment to a body, unlike\nthe body of this world, one which is devoid of matter (Mulla Sadra\n2001\u20135, IX: 165\u20136).\n\nMatter is inert and pure potentiality and, since the existence of the\nafterlife is free from potentiality and baseness, the body of the\nafterlife cannot be material. It is an image of the body that a\nparticular identity possessed. Mulla Sadra was keen to insist upon the\nQur\u2019anic account of bodily resurrection but he recognised that\nit was difficult to provide a philosophical account of the\nresurrection of this world\u2019s physical body. Hence his solution\nis to argue that humans have different bodies corresponding to\ndifferent levels of existence, in itself an application of substantial\nmotion. Corporeal existence is not eternal but mortal (Mulla Sadra\n2001\u20135, IX: 167). Bodies in this world exist through sensible\nforms; but the existence of the afterlife involves spiritual bodies\nattached to intelligible forms (Jambet 2006: 394\u20136). A corollary\nof his position on the survival of the soul-intellect in the afterlife\nthrough its perfection is the recognition that some intellects that\nremain potential and un-actualised have no afterlife. They are\nprevented from sharing in the happiness of the afterlife because the\nexistence of the afterlife has no place for the absence of active\nintellect and potentiality (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, IX:\n183\u20138). The account that he gives of the afterlife for the body\nis simple. The soul has creative power that stems from its direct\nrelationship with the creative power of God and after the death of the\nbody, it does not lose that power, nor does it lose its memory.\nRather, it produces a body of sorts from the memory of its prior\nembodiment and its mutual growth from its corporeal inception. The key\nissue was whether that body which the soul provides in the afterlife,\nanimated by the creative power of the divine, constitutes the bodily\nresurrection of scripture.\n\nMulla Sadra, wishing to save the appearance of the Qur\u2019anic\naccount, asserts that scripture does not define the nature of the body\nthat is resurrected. The body of this world has physicality,\ncorporeality, volume and so forth and significantly is finite. The\nbody of the afterlife is \u2018born of the (perfected) soul\u2019\nand still retains the property of being a body but unlike one with\nwhich we are familiar (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, IX, 279\u201380).\nThe second birth of the human is this new body and soul of the\nafterlife: he tries to settle his argument with a quotation from\nJesus: \u2018One who is not born twice will never reach the heavens\nof the afterlife\u2019 (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, IX: 302).\n",
