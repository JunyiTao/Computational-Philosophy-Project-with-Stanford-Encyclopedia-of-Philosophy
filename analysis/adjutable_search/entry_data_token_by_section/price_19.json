    "main_text": "Building on Hume || Hume on Induction\n4.5 Hume on Induction\n\nPrice (1940b) takes Hume\u2019s discovery of the problem of induction\nto be \u201cHume\u2019s greatest service to Philosophy\n[\u2026and\u2026] one of the most important advances in the whole\nhistory of thought\u201d (1940b: 30). On Price\u2019s (1940b:\n17\u201331) helpful, detailed analysis, the problem is, for instance,\nnot that induction seems to be \u201can irrational\nprocess\u201d (like committing logical fallacies is) but a\n\u201cnon-rational\u201d one (like sleeping) (1940b: 31).\nPrice interprets Hume\u2019s \u201cmore constructive solution of the\nproblem\u201d (1940b: 31) as the articulation of a sense of\nreasonableness, a criterion of \u201cjust reasoning\u201d, an\ninductive sense \u201cover and above the principles of deductive\ninference enunciated by Formal Logic\u201d (1940b: 35). Asking why it\nis sensible or reasonable to generalise and predict in an inductive\nway is to ask an important though \u201cmeaningless question\u201d\nor \u201cnot a question at all\u201d (1940b: 34). This reading of\nHume is echoed later in Strawson\u2019s (1952: 256ff) famous\n\u201canalytic solution\u201d (Snowdon 2009: \u00a78.4). According\nto Price, this dissolution fits well with ordinary thinking about\nreasonableness (1940b: 36; and\n \u00a72.3\n above). However, Price (1969: ch. 7, 176ff; also 1940b: 29) argues\nthat Hume\u2019s conception of induction is too narrow, since it\nholds only for \u201cthe causal sort of constant conjunction\u201d\n(1969: 176); induction is relevant also in other contexts.\n",
