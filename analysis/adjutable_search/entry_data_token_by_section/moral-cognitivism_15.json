    "main_text": "Motivations for Non-cognitivism || The Distinctiveness of Moral Disagreement?\n3.5 The Distinctiveness of Moral Disagreement?\n\nTheorists sometimes present the motivations for noncognitivism as\nrooted in the distinctive nature of moral disagreement. For example,\nGibbard (1990) begins with a puzzle about how (for instance) two\npeople who both fully understand the prisoner\u2019s dilemma scenario\ncan still disagree over what it is rational for someone in such a\nsituation to do. It doesn\u2019t seem that they are asking after the\nmeaning of the word \u2018rational\u2019 yet there also\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be any descriptive fact over which they\ndisagree. And Stevenson (1944) begins his book by distinguishing the\nkind of disagreement in play when two people disagree in their\nordinary beliefs from \u201cdisagreements in attitude\u201d which\ninvolve conative clash. Having made the distinction he suggests that\nmoral disagreements involve both, and then uses that diagnosis to\nmotivate his own noncognitivism as developed in the rest of the\nbook.\n\nWhile each of these theorists highlights disagreement, it seems that\ndisagreement is only part of what generates the argument for\nnoncognitivism. On one reading, Gibbard\u2019s argument seems to\ntacitly involve one of the assumptions that makes the Open Question\nArgument seem compelling \u2013 that property identities are fully\ntransparent to competent thinkers. Our confidence that the dispute\nover what is rational in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma dispute is not\nover a descriptive fact seems rooted in the stipulation that all the\ndescriptive facts are clear to both thinkers. But that stipulation\nonly settles the matter if we further assume that the identity of\nrationality and the property picked out the the relevant description\n(if indeed there is such and identity) will be transparent to the\nparties to the dispute. So this reading of Gibbard\u2019s argument\nwill have it stand or fall with the Open Question Argument.\n\nOn a second reading of Gibbard\u2019s argument it emphasizes the\ndistinctive practical or action-guiding nature of moral concepts. What\nany purely descriptive account of the dispute leaves out is that the\nparties disagree about what to do when in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma.\nThis version of Gibbard\u2019s point aligns with Stevenson\u2019s\n\u2013 there is a kind of practical disagreement that purely\ncognitive analyses of moral arguments leave out. If that is the point\nof adverting to disagreement we are back with the motivating concerns\ndiscussed in section 3.3. So it may be best to just think of\ndisagreement as highlighting these prior ideas.\n",
