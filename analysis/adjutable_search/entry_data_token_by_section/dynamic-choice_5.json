    "main_text": "Challenging Choice Situations, Problematic Preference Structures, and Dynamic Choice Problems || Autonomous Benefit Cases\n1.5 Autonomous Benefit Cases\n\nThe discussions in the preceding three sections suggest that, when it\ncomes to serving one\u2019s concerns well, the ability to choose\ncounter-preferentially may be quite helpful. This point is reinforced\nby the possibility of autonomous benefit cases.\n\nIn autonomous benefit cases, one benefits from forming a certain\nintention but not from carrying out the associated action. The\nautonomous benefit cases that have figured most prominently in the\nliterature on dynamic choice are those in which carrying out the\naction associated with the beneficial intention is detrimental rather\nthan just unrewarding. Among the most famous autonomous benefit cases\nis Gregory Kavka\u2019s \u201ctoxin puzzle\u201d (1983). In\nKavka\u2019s invented case,\n\nan eccentric billionaire\u2026places before you a vial of\ntoxin\u2026[and provides you with the following information:] If you\ndrink [the toxin], [it] will make you painfully ill for a day, but\nwill not threaten your life or have any lasting effects\u2026. The\nbillionaire will pay you one million dollars tomorrow morning if, at\nmidnight tonight, you intend to drink the toxin tomorrow\nafternoon\u2026. You need not drink the toxin to receive the money;\nin fact, the money will already be in your bank account hours before\nthe time for drinking it arrives, if you succeed\u2026. [The]\narrangement of\u2026external incentives is ruled out, as are such\nalternative gimmicks as hiring a hypnotist to implant the\nintention\u2026 (Kavka 1983, 33\u20134)\n\n\nPart of what is interesting about this case is that, even though most\npeople would gladly drink the toxin for a million dollars, getting the\nmillion dollars is not that easy. This is because one does not get the\nmillion dollars for drinking the toxin. Indeed, one does not get\nanything but a day of illness for drinking the toxin. As Kavka\nexplains, by the time the toxin is to be consumed, one either already\nhas the million in one\u2019s account or not; and drinking the toxin\nwill not get one any (additional) funds. Assuming one has no desire to\nbe ill for nothing, drinking the toxin seems to involve acting\ncounter-preferentially\u2014and this is, if not impossible, at least\nno easy feat. So, given a clear understanding of the situation, one is\nlikely to find it difficult, if not impossible, to form the intention\nto drink the toxin. Presumably, one cannot form the intention to drink\nthe toxin if one is confident that one will not drink it. If only one\ncould somehow rely on the cooperation of one\u2019s future self, one\ncould then genuinely form the intention to drink the toxin and thus\nget the million\u2014a wonderful result from the perspective of both\none\u2019s current and one\u2019s future self. But, alas,\none\u2019s future self will, it seems, have no reason to drink the\ntoxin when the time for doing so arrives.\n\nHere again we have a situation in which doing well by oneself is not\neasy.\n",
