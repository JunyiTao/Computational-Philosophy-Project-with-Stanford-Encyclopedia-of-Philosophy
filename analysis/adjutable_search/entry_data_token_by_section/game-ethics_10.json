Analyzing Morally Significant Social Issues\n\nIf contractarian approaches to justifying moral and political orders\nhave been the area of ethics where the use of game theory has been\nmost systematic, the area where its deployment is likely to be most\nimpactful going forward is in the analysis of morally significant\nsocial issues. Examples range from global issues, like how to combat\nclimate change; to issues that arise within states or communities,\nlike tax policy or how to manage common pool resources; to issues that\nprimarily concern individuals and groups, like how to elicit optimal\nlevels of effort from individuals engaged in cooperative endeavors.\nBelow we will discuss three examples in more detail.\n",
