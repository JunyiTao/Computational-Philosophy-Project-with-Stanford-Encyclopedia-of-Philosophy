    "main_text": "14th Century Theories of Consequence || The British School\n3.4 The British School\n\nIn the British tradition, which is then continued in Italy in the late\n14th century and 15th century (Courtenay 1982),\nthe definition of consequence in terms of necessary truth-preservation\n(TP) is also unanimously adopted, as for example in Billingham\n(Billingham/Weber 2003, 80), Strode (cited in (Pozzi 1978, 237)) and\nPaul of Venice (Logica Parva, p. 167). In fact, these authors\npresent variations of (TP) without much discussion or analysis,\ncontrary to what is found in Buridan\u2019s treatise, for example. More\ngenerally, the treatises in this tradition are characterized by a\nlesser degree of conceptual sophistication if compared to the earlier\ntreatises by Ockham, Burley or Buridan. The goal seems to be mostly\npedagogical, i.e. presenting \u2018rules of thumb\u2019 to argue\ncorrectly, rather than presenting a systematic, conceptual analysis of\nthe concept of consequence.\n\nStill, what is characteristic of this tradition is a specific\ninterpretation of the idea of the conclusion being\ncontained/understood (intelligitur) in the premises \u2014\nthat is, condition (Co) \u2013 which these authors rely on\nextensively to define the concept of formal consequence. We have seen\nthat for Abelard, something like (Co) is a necessary condition for all\nconsequences/inferences, which Martin (2004) spells out in terms of a\ncriterion of relevance. 13th century authors, such as\nKilwardby (for whom (Co) provided the definition of natural\nconsequences) and Faversham, also discussed variations of this idea\n(Read 2010, 177/8), but prior to the late 14th century, it\nwas not always formulated in epistemic/psychological terms. The\nauthors in the 14th century British tradition typically\nformulate the definition of formal consequence on the basis of\nvariations of (Co), but giving it a very explicitly epistemic\ntwist.\n\nLavenham, for example, says (as quoted in King 2001, 133): \u201cA\nconsequence is formal when the consequent necessarily belongs to the\nunderstanding of the antecedent, as it is in the case of syllogistic\nconsequence, and in many enthymematic consequences\u201d. Strode\npresents a similar formulation:\n\nA consequence said to be formally valid is one of which if it is\nunderstood to be as is adequately signified through the antecedent\nthen it is understood to be just as is adequately signified through\nthe consequent. For if someone understands you to be a man then he\nunderstands you to be an animal. (Translation in Normore 1993, 449).\n\n\nSeveral other authors formulated similar definitions, such as\nBillingham (Weber 2003, 80) and Fland (Fland/Spade 1976). Normore\n(1993, 449) argues that a significant transformation occurred in the\n14th century British tradition, which \u201cputs in play\nthe idea that deduction is not an objective relation between abstract\nobjects or sentences but a mental operation performed on the bases of\nwhat can be understood or imagined.\u201d This is noticeable not only\nin the definitions of formal (as opposed to material) consequence, but\nalso in the very definitions of consequence which begin to mention\nmental acts, such as: \u201ca consequence is a derivation\n(illatio) of the consequent from the antecedent\u201d\n(Strode, quoted in Normore 1993, 449).\n\nThe epistemic/psychological interpretation of these formulations of\nformal consequences has not gone uncontested; arguably, they are\nequally compatible with a semantic interpretation emphasizing\nthe signification of sentences (Read 2010, 178). But it is clear that,\nwhile the Parisian tradition defined the concept of formal consequence\nin terms of (ST), the British tradition formulated the same concept in\nterms of (Co). Both were ideas that had been floating around for\ncenturies, but which yield very different conceptions of what counts\nas a formal consequence. These two approaches are not only\nintensionally divergent; they also disagree on the extension of the\nclass of formal consequences. (ST)-formal consequences do not include\nenthymematic consequences such as \u2018Socrates is a man, therefore\nSocrates is an animal\u2019, but (Co)-formal consequences typically\ndo. For British authors, the class of material consequences is often\ncomposed exclusively of consequences of the kind \u2018from the\nimpossible anything follows\u2019 and \u2018the necessary follows\nfrom anything\u2019, which satisfy the truth-preservation criterion\n(TP) a fortiori, but typically fail relevant/containment\ncriteria. \u2018God does not exist, therefore you are a donkey\u2019\ncounts as a valid consequence according to (TP) (\u2018God does not\nexist\u2019 is considered to be an impossible sentence), but the\nconsequent is not contained in the antecedent in the same way as in\n\u2018Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is an animal\u2019. To\nmark this distinction, 14th century British authors would\ntypically view the former as a material consequence and the latter as\na formal consequence (Ashworth & Spade 1992).\n",
