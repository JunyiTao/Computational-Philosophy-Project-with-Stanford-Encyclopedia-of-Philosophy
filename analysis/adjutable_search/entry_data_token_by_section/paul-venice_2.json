    "main_text": "Logic || Identities and Distinctions\n2.1 Identities and Distinctions\n\nPaul\u2019s formulation of the theory of identity and distinction is\na further development of Duns Scotus\u2019 and Wyclif\u2019s\ndoctrines on the subject. The Italian master recognizes two main types\nof identity: material (secundum materiam) and formal\n(secundum formam). There is material identity when the\nmaterial cause is the same, either in number (it is a case of the same\nthing called in different ways) or by species (it is a case of two\nobjects made of the same kind of stuff). There is formal identity when\nthe formal cause is the same. This happens in two ways: if the form at\nissue is the singular form of the individual composite, then there is\na unique object known in different ways; if the form at issue is the\ncommon essence instantiated by the singular form, then there are two\ndistinct objects belonging to the same species or genus (In\nMetaph., book V, tr. 2, chap. 3, fol. 185ra). Correspondingly,\nthe main types of distinction (or difference) are also two: material\nand formal. There is material distinction when the material cause is\ndifferent, so that the objects at issue are separable entities. In\ngeneral, there is formal distinction when the formal cause is\ndifferent. This happens in two ways: if the material cause is also\ndifferent, then it is a particular case of material distinction. If\nthe material cause is the same, then a further analysis is necessary.\nIf the material cause is the same by species only, then it is an\nimproper case of formal distinction; but if the material cause is the\nsame in number, then there is properly formal distinction, since the\nforms at issue have different definite descriptions but share the same\nsubstrate of existence, so that they are one and the same thing in\nreality. For example, there is a proper formal distinction in the case\nof the two properties of being-capable-of-laughing (risibile)\nand of being-capable-of-learning (disciplinabile), which are\nconnected forms instantiated by the same set of individual substances\n(In Metaph., book V, tr. 2, chap. 3, fol. 185rb).\n\nMaterial distinction is a necessary and sufficient criterion for real\ndifference, traditionally conceived, whereas there is formal\ndistinction if and only if there is one substance in number (i.e.\nmaterial identity in the strict sense) and a multiplicity of formal\nprinciples with different descriptions instantiated by it. Paul\ntherefore inverts the terms of the question in relation to what\nearlier approaches had done. By means of the formal distinction Duns\nScotus and John Wyclif had tried to explain how it is possible to\ndistinguish many different real aspects internal to the same\nindividual substance (the passage is from one to many). On the\ncontrary, Paul is attempting to reduce multiplicity to unity (the\npassage is from many to one). What Paul wants to account for is the\nway in which many different entities of a certain kind (i.e. of an\nincomplete and dependent mode of existence) can constitute one and the\nsame substance in number.\n",
