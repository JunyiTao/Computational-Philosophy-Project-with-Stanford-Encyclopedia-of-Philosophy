    "main_text": "Grounds of Moral Status\n5. Grounds of Moral Status\n\nAccounts differ on what it is about the individual that grounds or\nconfers moral status and to what degree. This section will focus\nprimarily on the grounds of FMS. We begin with the Sophisticated\nCognitive Capacities accounts and their main strengths and\nshortcomings, especially when it comes to capturing the\n\u201ccommonsense view\u201d discussed in section 1. We then show\nthat alternative accounts also face troubles. So, the challenge\nremains to provide a plausible unified account of the grounds of FMS,\nespecially for those who wish to defend the commonsense view. The\norder of presentation is, roughly, dialectical, not historical.\n",
