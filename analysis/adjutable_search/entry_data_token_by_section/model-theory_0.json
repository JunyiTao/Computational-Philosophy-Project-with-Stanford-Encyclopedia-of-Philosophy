    "main_text": "Basic notions of model theory\n1. Basic notions of model theory\n\nSometimes we write or speak a sentence \\(S\\) that expresses nothing\neither true or false, because some crucial information is missing\nabout what the words mean. If we go on to add this information, so\nthat \\(S\\) comes to express a true or false statement, we are said to\ninterpret \\(S\\), and the added information is called an\ninterpretation of \\(S\\). If the interpretation \\(I\\) happens\nto make \\(S\\) state something true, we say that \\(I\\) is a\nmodel of \\(S\\), or that \\(I\\) satisfies \\(S\\), in\nsymbols \u2018\\(I \\vDash S\\)\u2019. Another way of saying that \\(I\\)\nis a model of \\(S\\) is to say that \\(S\\) is true in \\(I\\),\nand so we have the notion of model-theoretic truth, which is\ntruth in a particular interpretation. But one should remember that the\nstatement \u2018\\(S\\) is true in \\(I\\)\u2019 is just a paraphrase of\n\u2018\\(S\\), when interpreted as in \\(I\\), is true\u2019; so\nmodel-theoretic truth is parasitic on plain ordinary truth, and we can\nalways paraphrase it away.\n\nFor example I might say\n\nHe is killing all of them,\n\n\nand offer the interpretation that \u2018he\u2019 is Alfonso\nArblaster of 35 The Crescent, Beetleford, and that \u2018them\u2019\nare the pigeons in his loft. This interpretation explains (a) what\nobjects some expressions refer to, and (b) what classes some\nquantifiers range over. (In this example there is one quantifier:\n\u2018all of them\u2019). Interpretations that consist of items (a)\nand (b) appear very often in model theory, and they are known as\nstructures. Particular kinds of model theory use particular\nkinds of structure; for example mathematical model theory tends to use\nso-called first-order structures, model theory of modal\nlogics uses Kripke structures, and so on. \n\nThe structure \\(I\\) in the previous paragraph involves one fixed\nobject and one fixed class. Since we described the structure today,\nthe class is the class of pigeons in Alfonso\u2019s loft today, not\nthose that will come tomorrow to replace them. If Alfonso Arblaster\nkills all the pigeons in his loft today, then \\(I\\) satisfies the\nquoted sentence today but won\u2019t satisfy it tomorrow, because\nAlfonso can\u2019t kill the same pigeons twice over. Depending on\nwhat you want to use model theory for, you may be happy to evaluate\nsentences today (the default time), or you may want to record how they\nare satisfied at one time and not at another. In the latter case you\ncan relativise the notion of model and write \u2018\\(I \\vDash_t\nS\\)\u2019 to mean that \\(I\\) is a model of \\(S\\) at time \\(t\\). The\nsame applies to places, or to anything else that might be picked up by\nother implicit indexical features in the sentence. For example if you\nbelieve in possible worlds, you can index \\(\\vDash\\) by the possible\nworld where the sentence is to be evaluated. Apart from using set\ntheory, model theory is completely agnostic about what kinds of thing\nexist.\n\nNote that the objects and classes in a structure carry labels that\nsteer them to the right expressions in the sentence. These labels are\nan essential part of the structure.\n\nIf the same class is used to interpret all quantifiers, the class is\ncalled the domain or universe of the structure. But\nsometimes there are quantifiers ranging over different classes. For\nexample if I say\n\nOne of those thingummy diseases is killing all the birds.\n\n\nyou will look for an interpretation that assigns a class of diseases\nto \u2018those thingummy diseases\u2019 and a class of birds to\n\u2018the birds\u2019. Interpretations that give two or more classes\nfor different quantifiers to range over are said to be\nmany-sorted, and the classes are sometimes called the\nsorts. \n\nThe ideas above can still be useful if we start with a sentence \\(S\\)\nthat does say something either true or false without needing further\ninterpretation. (Model theorists say that such a sentence is fully\ninterpreted.) For example we can consider\nmisinterpretations \\(I\\) of a fully interpreted sentence\n\\(S\\). A misinterpretation of \\(S\\) that makes it true is known as a\nnonstandard or unintended model of \\(S\\). The branch\nof mathematics called nonstandard analysis is based on nonstandard\nmodels of mathematical statements about the real or complex number\nsystems; see\n Section 4\n below.\n\nOne also talks of model-theoretic semantics of natural\nlanguages, which is a way of describing the meanings of\nnatural language sentences, not a way of giving them\nmeanings. The connection between this semantics and model theory is a\nlittle indirect. It lies in Tarski\u2019s truth definition of 1933.\nSee the entry on\n Tarski\u2019s truth definitions\n for more details.\n",
