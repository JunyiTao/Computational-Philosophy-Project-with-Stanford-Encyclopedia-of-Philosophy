    "main_text": "Physical cartesianism and the consequences of metaphysical divergence || The principle of inertia and striving\n3.3 The principle of inertia and striving\n\nAn intriguing shift in the language Spinoza uses in the PCP\nto articulate the Cartesian laws of motion is suggestive of how\nSpinozistic and Cartesian inertia may differ. In PCP IIp16,\nSpinoza states \u201cevery body which moves in a circle, as for\nexample, a stone in a sling, is continuously determined to go on\nmoving along a tangent.\u201d The immediately succeeding proposition,\nPCP IIp17, states, \u201cEvery body that moves in a circle\nstrives to move away from the center of the circle that it\ndescribes\u201d (emphasis added). Spinoza has substituted\n\u201cstrives\u201d for \u201cis continuously determined to\ndo\u201d, the Latin \u201cconari\u201d for the\n\u201ctendere\u201d of PCP IIp16, which is what\nDescartes had used in expressing his own version of the law of\ncentrifugal motion. This substitution arguably involves a shift in\ndynamical implication. Conari usually has the sense of the\nEnglish \u201cexertion\u201d, \u201ceffort\u201d\n\u201cundertaking\u201d, or \u201cimpulse\u201d; reading\nconari in accord with this usual sense, PCP IIp17\nnot only describes what a body moving circularly will do when it is\nnot compelled by an external cause, but attributes that action to the\neffort or impulse of the moving body. PCP IIp17's invocation\nof conari, if we read it in this active sense, signals an\nongoing effort, a continuous directedness, in this case, at\nhomeostasis.\n\nOne must be quite circumspect in drawing inferences from this\nterminological shift on Spinoza's part. For one thing, the word for\nwhich conari is substituted, tendere, can have\nsimilar connotations itself, carrying the sense of a try or an\nattempt. For another, \u201cconari\u201d is, as Curley\npoints out (Spinoza 1985, p. 280 n. 43), a perfectly good Cartesian\nword, and in Descartes' usage, it is quite clear that\n\u201cconari\u201d is not intended to imply anything really\nactive on the part of the \u201cstriving\u201d body. In\nPrinciples 3.56, Descartes tells us that the striving\n(conari) after some motion of inanimate things \u201cmerely\nmeans that they are positioned and pushed into motion in such a way\nthat they will in fact travel in that direction, unless they are\nprevented by some other cause\u201d. Spinoza faithfully reiterates\nthis passive sense of \u201cstriving\u201d on Descartes' behalf in\nPCP IIId3. On the other hand, \u201cconari\u201d\nis also cognate with a perfectly good Spinozistic word,\n\u201cconatus\u201d, which is his term in the\nEthics for an individual's inherent power of striving to\npersevere in its being (IIp6). Spinoza identifies this power as the\nessence of the individual (IIIp7), and further identifies its increase\nwith the individual's increased power of action, as opposed to\npassion, that is, with an increase in power of self-determination as\nopposed to external determination (IIIp11). This suggests that\n\u201cconari\u201d, as Spinoza intends it, involves\nsomething more than the mere passive tendency the term signifies for\nDescartes. Recalling once again that the inertial tendency of bodies\ndescribed in PCP IIp14 cannot, for Spinoza, be accounted for\nby appeal, in the manner of Descartes, to divine will, the\nsubstitution of \u201cconari\u201d for\n\u201ctendere\u201d in PCP IIp17 may signal the\nfact that Spinoza is all along thinking of inertia as resulting from\nan active principle in bodies as such.\n\nIf Spinoza's principle of inertia is to provide a ground for\nPCP IIp17 taken as involving \u201cconari\u201d in\nan active sense, then it must be taken to amount to the claim not just\nthat bodies will not in fact change their state unless externally\ndetermined to do so, but also that even while external causes are\nacting on a body (e.g., the sling holding the stone in circular\nmotion), the body's own impulse is at work actively endeavoring to\ndetermine it to move as it would in the absence of that external\ncause. And reading Spinozistic inertia this way, imputing to the body\na continuous effort to move so as to maintain the state it\nwould be in absent external determination, also suits it to ground the\nPLMM. Given the symmetry of interaction, each of the bodies to an\ninteraction, being externally determined to change by the other, will\nstrive to resist change as far as it is able. Plausibly, then, the\ntotal change of state resulting from the resolution of the opposition\nof the interacting bodies will be the least total possible. This\nsuggests, at least tentatively, that even in the PCP, Spinoza\nis at work attempting to shore up worries in the foundations of\nCartesian physics that stem from the unduly passive Cartesian\nconstrual of the equation of body with extension.\n\n",
