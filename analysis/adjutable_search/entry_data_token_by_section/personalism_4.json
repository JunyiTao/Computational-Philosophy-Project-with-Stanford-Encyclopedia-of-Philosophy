    "main_text": "Eastern personalism\n5. Eastern personalism\n\n\nIn some respects close parallels to or equivalents of Western\npersonalism are present in Islamic, Buddhist, Vedantic, and Chinese\nthought, although comparative work in this field is confronted with\noften formidable problems of translation and interpretation.\n\n\nWith regard to Islam, it should first of all be pointed out that\nclassic Islamic philosophy, with its roots in classical Greek\nphilosophy, is not Eastern in the same sense as Buddhist, Vedantic,\nChinese, and Japanese thought. It shares roots with Augustinianism and\nThomism, and thus with some of the traditions that have been central\nto the development of personalism in the West. On the other hand, it\nhas been observed that there is no conceptual equivalent of the\nWestern philosophical concept of \u201cperson\u201d in Arabic and in\nclassic Islamic philosophy, something which would seem to confirm the\nimportance of the specifically Christian, to a considerable extent\nTrinitological, terminological and conceptual origins of the term. But\nas there are other sources of personalism than the Trinitological\nthought that was decisive for the early formation of the concept\n(when, it should also be remembered, it was not yet fully\npersonalistic in the modern sense), and as these sources have also\nproduced Jewish versions of personalism, the historical absence of a\nconceptual equivalent in Arabic has not precluded the development of\nIslamic personalism. Themes with regard to the self and the nature of\nGod which are very similar to those of Western personalists are found\nin a modern Muslim thinker like Muhammad Iqbal\n(1877\u20131938). Mohammed Aziz Lahbabi (1922\u20131993) explicitly\nsought to develop a Muslim version of personalism, and was influenced\nnot least by Mounier.\n\n\nNo precise conceptual counterpart of \u201cperson\u201d is found in\nthe more properly Eastern traditions of thought either, traditions\nwhich do not share the Greek philosophical roots. When we speak of\npersonalism in the case of these traditions, it is in the sense of\nthemes and positions, elaborated in terms of other concepts, closer to\nsuch Western ones as \u201cself\u201d and \u201cindividual\u201d,\nwhich are part of Western personalism and enter into the definition of\nthe modern concept of person.\n\n\nThe term \u2018personalism\u2019 has, for instance, been applied to\nthe early Buddhist school called puggalavada, which takes\npositions with regard to the identity and continuity of the individual\nself which differ from what has traditionally been considered the\northodox ones of Theravada Buddhism. Other versions of these positions\nare found later in some of the currents of Mahayana thought.\n\n\nMore unambiguous parallels are found, however, in\nVedanta. The vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) school\nturned against advaita\u2019s radical non-dualism, and insisted\nnot only on what in English works by representatives of this school\nand later schools which are similarly critical of advaita, is\noften explicitly termed the personal concept of brahman or\nthe absolute, but also on a personal understanding of the individual\nbeings that are conceived as fragmentary selves (jivatmas)\nthat are \u201cparts\u201d \u2013 at the same time one with and\ndistinct transformations \u2013 of\nbrahman. As the different classical darshanas of\nIndian thought are not wholly isolated and receive influences\nfrom each other, elements of Samkhya thought are also taken up in\npersonalistic Vedanta, as are still further elements of Yoga, and of\nthe traditional Hindu scriptural legacy. It is the clarity, the\ntraditional primordiality, and the fundamental nature of the teaching\nof the permanent self, the atman, in Vedanta, and not least in\nthe schools critical of advaita, which make this personalism\nmore unambiguous than puggalavada\u2019s in Buddhism.\n\n\nA striking feature of the debates within Vedanta between the\nnon-dualist, impersonalist schools and the theistic, personalist ones\nis the partial similarities with and parallels to the opposition\nbetween nineteenth-century representatives absolute idealism and\npersonalistic idealism in the West, despite the distance between them\nin time and space, the mutual independence, and the different\nconceptual contexts. But while there is a long-standing scholarly\ntradition of comparative work on advaita Vedanta and absolute\nidealism (not least in F. H. Bradley\u2019s version), only very\nlittle such work has as yet been done on the vishishtadvaita\nand similar personalist Vedantic schools and the early, idealistic\npersonalists in the West.\n\n\nWhat most clearly distinguishes Vedantic personalism from Western\npersonalism is that the former builds on the fundamental teaching\nof all Vedanta that the true self exists beyond the\nlimitations of the transient body and the mind, and beyond the\ntendency \u2013 called in Sanskrit the ahamkara, literally,\nthe \u201cI-maker\u201d \u2013 to identify with these, whereas\nWestern personalism is often characteristically defined in terms which\nfrom the perspective of Vedanta must be seen as pertaining to the\nmental level, or sometimes, in particular in the twentieth century, to\nthe physical body.\n\n\nThis does not mean, however, that according to personalistic Vedanta\nthe body should be ignored or devalued. It is from its perspective\nprimarily the erroneous identification with the mind that is harmful\nto the body, as it indeed is to the proper use of the mind itself. The\nactualization of our true and higher nature as consciousness, as\nthe sat-cit-ananda (being/eternity, knowledge, and bliss)\nthat are the nature of the atman-brahman, brings light to\nboth the body and the mind, including all the faculties so closely\nanalysed by Western personalists, like will, imagination, and\nreason. Thus it at least indirectly supports, to the extent it is\nneeded, the moral character-formation on the humanistic level which is\nemphasized by Western personalism.\n\n\nMost traditional Chinese and Japanese thought shares with personalism\nan emphasis on the need for concrete, practical transformation of\ncharacter as a prerequisite for insight. In the Chinese and Japanese\nversions of Buddhism, the Indian tradition of devising specific\npractices and exercises for this purpose was continued, but gradually\ndisconnected from the parallel and very strong theoretical and\nmetaphysical legacy of India. This development can be said to\nculminate in Zen. But the emphasis on the practical is found also in\nTaoism, which contributed to the development of Zen. At the same time\nall of these schools share an understanding of the ultimate or true\nreality as rather impersonal than personal, which makes them further\nremoved from personalism than Vedanta.\n\n\nConfucianism shares with the other Chinese and Japanese traditions the\nemphasis on the practical. Contrary to them, however, it is focused\nmuch more exclusively on the \u201chumanistic\u201d level, on moral\ncharacter-formation, and the requirements of the social order. While\nits humanistic orientation is in line with personalism, Confucianism\nis, however, more concerned with the practical attainment of the\ngeneral ideals of true humanity and gentlemanliness as understood in\ntraditional China, than with the personal individuality and uniqueness\nwhich Western personalists stress as related to, and often indeed as\ninseparable from, a true understanding and affirmation of universal\nvalues. Neo-Confucianism, as developed by Chu Hsi (1130\u20131200),\nintroduced strong metaphysical elements, but the understanding of the\nmetaphysical principles or laws, li, was still a generalist\none. Other Neo-Confucians differed to some extent in this respect,\nand, as Confucianism is a living tradition in today\u2019s China, new\nthinkers keep developing versions of it which are closer to\npersonalism. This, and the importance of humanist character-formation,\nspeaks in favour of the designation of Confucianism in general as a\npersonalistic philosophy. But there are also some considerations that\nspeak against it, both general ones regarding some aspects of\nhistorical Chinese society, and, in view of Chu Hsi\u2019s version of\nNeo-Confucianism, metaphysical ones.\n",
