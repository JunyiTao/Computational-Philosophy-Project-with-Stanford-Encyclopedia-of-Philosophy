Mincemeat Unmade: Lakatos versus Feyerabend\n\nAccording to his friend Paul Feyerabend, Lakatos was \u201cwas a\nfascinating person, an outstanding thinker and the best philosopher of\nscience of our strange and uncomfortable century\u201d (Feyerabend\n1975a: 1). Writing in 1981, John Fox raised a cynical eyebrow:\n\n\nAs when Lakatos similarly praises Popper, it is easy to suspect\nindirect self-advertisement: building up one\u2019s opponent so that\nthe announced victory is taken as winning a world title (Fox 1981:\n92).\n\n\nWith Motterlini\u2019s publication of the Feyerabend/Lakatos\ncorrespondence (F&AM), Fox\u2019s suspicions have been amply\nconfirmed. It is quite clear that Lakatos and Feyerabend were engaged\nin a self-conscious campaign of mutual boosterism, leading up to a\nplanned epic encounter between a fallibilistic rationalism, as\nrepresented by Lakatos, and epistemological anarchism, as represented\nby Feyerabend. As Feyerabend put it \u201cI was to attack the\nrationalist position, Imre was to restate and defend it, making\nmincemeat of me in the process\u201d (Feyerabend 1975b: preface).\nThis Battle of the Titans was to consist of Feyerabend\u2019s\nAgainst Method and Lakatos\u2019s projected reply, which is\nreferred to, in their correspondence, by the mysterious acronym\n\u201cMAM\u201d.\n\nSometimes the mutual boosterism went a bit too far, causing pain and\ndistress to serious-minded philosophers who regarded Popperian\ncritical rationalism as a bulwark against a resurgent Nazism:\n\n\nHans Albert is on the verge of suicide [writes Lakatos to Feyerabend].\nAllegedly somebody told him that in Kiel you will describe critical\nrationalism as a \u201cmental disease\u201d, and he thinks that will\nbe the end of Reason in Germany. I told him that though you are AN\nEXTREMELY GREAT MAN, that you will not bring Nazism back\nsingle-handedly\u2026. (F&AM: 291).\n\n\nBut although they had interested motives for talking each other up, it\nis clear that the mutual admiration between Feyerabend and Lakatos was\nquite sincere. Each genuinely regarded the other as the man to\nbeat.\n\nFeyerabend\u2019s criticism of Lakatos is summed up in his joking\ndedication to Against Method: To IMRE LAKATOS Friend and\nFellow-Anarchist. In other words Feyerabend\u2019s charge is\nthat for all his law-and-order pretensions as a defender of the\nrationality of science and a critic of pseudoscience, Lakatos is\nreally an epistemic anarchist malgr\u00e9 lui.\nFeyerabend\u2019s epistemological anarchism is sometimes summed up by\nthe slogan \u201cAnything goes\u201d but that is a little\nmisleading. His point is rather this: If you want a set of\nmethodological rules distinguishing between good science and bad\nscience, the only thing that won\u2019t exclude some of\nwhat you (Dear Reader) regard as the best science is the\nprinciple \u201cAnything goes\u201d. Anything else would rule out\nwhat is widely regarded as some of the best science as unscientific.\nThus a large proportion of Feyerabend\u2019s Against Method\nis devoted to \u201cpraising\u201d Galileo for his allegedly\nanti-Popperian practices and his dodgy (but progressive) rhetorical\ntricks. Everyone agrees that Galileo was a great scientist. But if\nGalileo was great, then the rules that supposedly constitute great\nscience are defective since they would exclude some of the greatest of\nGalileo\u2019s great deeds.\n\nBut what about Lakatos? Feyerabend poses a dilemma. Suppose we apply\nthe Lakatos\u2019s methodology of scientific research programmes in a\nconservative or rigouristic spirit. Scientists are urged to abandon\ndegenerating research programmes in favour of the progressive, and\ngrant-giving agencies are urged to defund them. After all, such\nprogrammes are condemned by the Demarcation Criterion as bad\nscience or even non-science! At the very least, the adherents\nof degenerating research programmes must bear the stigma of\nirrationality, owning up to their scientific sins. But in that case\nLakatos\u2019s MSRP would be condemning some research programmes to\ndeath as bad science or even non-science that might otherwise recover\ntheir progressive (and hence their scientific) status. Thus Lakatos\nwould be vulnerable to the same criticism that he himself applies to\nPopper\u2014he would be excluding some of the best science as\nunscientific (that is, research programmes that have suffered a\ndegenerating phase only to stage a magnificent comeback). In response\nto this, Lakatos distinguished appraisal from advice, and said that\nthe task of the philosopher of science is to issue rules of appraisal,\nnot to advise scientists (or grant-giving agencies) about what they\nought to do. The Demarcation Criterion can evaluate the current state\nof play but it does not tell anyone what to do about it. (To\nparaphrase Marx\u2019s Thesis XI, \u201cMethodologists hitherto have\nattempted to change the world of scientific research in\nvarious ways; the point, however is to appraise it\u201d.)\nThe MSRP does enjoin a principle of scientific honesty, namely that\nthe adherents of degenerating research programmes should own up to\ntheir methodological shortcomings, such as the lack of novel\npredictions or the falsification of the predictions that they have\nmade. However, so long as they admit to these failures they can\n(rationally?) persist in their degenerate ways.\n\nBut in that case Lakatos is gored by the other horn of\nFeyerabend\u2019s dilemma. For Feyerabend argues that a Demarcation\nCriterion that cannot tell anyone what to do or not to do is scarcely\ndistinguishable from \u201cAnything goes\u201d. To revert to\nFeyerabend\u2019s political analogy, what is the difference between\nan anarchist society and a \u201cstate\u201d where the\n\u201cpolice\u201d can appraise people for their\n\u201ccriminal\u201d or \u201claw-abiding\u201d behaviour but can\nnever make an arrest or send anyone to jail? That\u2019s a\n\u201cstate\u201d which isn\u2019t a state and a \u201cpolice\nforce\u201d which isn\u2019t a police force! We have not scientific\nlaw-and-order but anarchy, accompanied by uplifting sermons and\nbenedictions posthumously bestowed on the mighty scientific dead.\n\nWhat was Lakatos\u2019s response to this dilemma? It is sometimes\nsuggested, not least by Feyerabend himself, that Lakatos did have, or\nwould have had, an answer but that he did not live to write it up.\nTheir correspondence suggests otherwise. Although the locus\nclassicus of Feyerabend\u2019s argument is chapter 16 of\nAgainst Method (1975b) he had already developed his dilemma\nin \u201cConsolations for the Specialist\u201d (1968) and Lakatos\nhad access to successive versions of the argument in the successive\ndrafts that Feyerebend sent him in the last is six years of his life.\nYet there is no trace of a counterargument in Lakatos\u2019s\nsurviving letters to Feyerabend. Instead there are a series of\nfearsome threats.\n\n\nI am now greatly grateful for your depicting me as God and\nyourself as the Devil. I also return the compliment: for me\nyou are the only philosopher worth demolishing. But there is\none trouble: I can take you to such little pieces\nthat only an electromicroscope can discover you again. Will you be\nvery hurt? (F&AM: 268\u20139.)\n\n\nHowever, aside from these threats, a developed answer to\nFeyerabend\u2019s dilemma is conspicuous by its absence. One is\nreminded of King Lear:\n\n\nI will do such things,\u2014\n\nWhat they are, yet I know not: but they shall be\n\nThe terrors of the earth.\n\n\nThe upshot is that if there is a Lakatosian answer to\nFeyerabend\u2019s dilemma, it is an answer that has to be concocted\non his behalf. One of us has a go in Musgrave 1976, but for the\nMethodology of Scientific Research Programmes, it is still, very much,\nan open problem.\n",
