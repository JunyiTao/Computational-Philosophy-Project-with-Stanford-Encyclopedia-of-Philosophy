    "main_text": "The Ethics of Belief: A brief history || Origins of the debate\n1.1 Origins of the debate\n\nThe locus classicus of the ethics of belief debate is,\nunsurprisingly, the essay that christened it. \u201cThe Ethics of\nBelief\u201d was published in 1877 by Cambridge mathematician and\nphilosopher William Kingdon Clifford, in a journal called\nContemporary Review. At the outset of the essay, Clifford\ndefends the stringent principle that we are all always\nobliged to have sufficient evidence for every one of our\nbeliefs. Indeed, the early sections of \u201cThe Ethics of\nBelief\u201d are so stern that William James would later characterize\nClifford as a \u201cdelicious enfant terrible\u201d who\ndefends doxastic self-control \u201cwith somewhat too much of\nrobustious pathos in the voice\u201d (1896, 8). \n\nJames's more permissive view\u2014initially a commentary on Clifford\npresented to the Philosophy Clubs of Yale and Brown, then published as\n\u201cThe Will to Believe\u201d in 1896\u2014has become a kind of\ncompanion piece, and together the two essays constitute the touchstone\nfor later discussions.\n\nClifford's essay is chiefly remembered for two things: a story and a\nprinciple. The story is that of a shipowner who, once upon a time, was\ninclined to sell tickets for a transatlantic voyage. It struck him\nthat his ship was rickety, and that its soundness might be in\nquestion. Knowing that repairs would be costly and cause significant\ndelay, the shipowner managed to push these worries aside and form the\n\u201csincere and comfortable conviction that his vessel was\nthoroughly safe and seaworthy.\u201d He sold the tickets, bade the\npassengers farewell, and then quietly collected the insurance money\n\u201cwhen she went down in mid-ocean and told no tales\u201d (1877,\n70).\n\nAccording to Clifford (who himself once survived a shipwreck, and so\nmust have found this behavior particularly loathsome), the owner in\nthe story was \u201cverily guilty of the death of those men,\u201d\nbecause even though he sincerely believed that the ship was sound,\n\u201che had no right to believe on such evidence as was before\nhim.\u201d Why did he have no such right? Because, says Clifford,\n\u201che had acquired his belief not by honestly earning it in\npatient investigation, but by stifling his doubts\u201d (1877, 70).\nAfter making this diagnosis, Clifford changes the end of the story:\nthe ship doesn't meet a liquid demise, but rather arrives safe and\nsound into New York harbor. Does the new outcome relieve the shipowner\nof blame for his belief? \u201cNot one jot,\u201d Clifford declares:\nhe is equally guilty\u2014equally blameworthy\u2014for believing\nsomething on insufficient evidence. \n\nClifford goes on to cite our intuitive indictments of the\nshipowner\u2014in both versions of the story\u2014as grounds for his\nfamous principle: \n\n(Clifford's Principle) \u201cIt is wrong always,\neverywhere, and for anyone to believe anything on insufficient\nevidence.\u201d\n\n\nDespite the synchronic character of his famous Principle,\nClifford's view is not merely that we must be in a certain state at\nthe precise time at which we form a belief. Rather, the obligation\nalways and only to believe on sufficient evidence governs our\nactivities across time as well. With respect to most if not all of the\npropositions we consider as candidates for belief, says Clifford, we\nare obliged to go out and gather evidence, remain open to new\nevidence, and consider the evidence offered by others. The\ndiachronic obligation here can be captured as follows:\n\n(Clifford's Other Principle) \u201cIt is wrong\nalways, everywhere, and for anyone to ignore evidence that is relevant\nto his beliefs, or to dismiss relevant evidence in a facile\nway.\u201d (Van Inwagen 1996, 145)\n\n\nThere might be at least two kinds of diachronic obligation here: one\ngoverning how we form and hold beliefs over time, and the other\ngoverning how we relinquish or revise beliefs over time. If someone\nviolates such a diachronic obligation by \u201cpurposely avoiding the\nreading of books and the company of men who call in question\u201d\nhis presuppositions, Clifford warns, then \u201cthe life of that man\nis one long sin against mankind\u201d (1877, 77). \n\nDespite the robustious pathos, it is not clear in the end that\nClifford's considered position is as extreme as these two principles\nmake it sound. In the later part of his essay Clifford puts forward a\nview about what it is for evidence to be \u201csufficient\u201d that\nsuggests a more moderate stance. Still, the story about the shipowner\ntogether with the sternly-worded Principles turned Clifford into the\niconic representative of a strict \u201cEvidentialist\u201d position\nin the ethics of belief\u2014the position, roughly, that we are\nobliged to form beliefs always and only on the basis of sufficient\nevidence that is in our possession. (For more on the notion of\n\u201cevidence\u201d and the varieties of Evidentialism, see\n\u00a74-\u00a75 below).\n\nJames's Non-Evidentialist alternative to Clifford is far more\npermissive: it says that there are some contexts in which it is fine\nto form a belief even though we don't have sufficient\nevidence for it, and even though we know that we don't. In fact, James\nand many of his \u201cpragmatist\u201d followers claim that\nsometimes we are positively obliged to form beliefs on\ninsufficient evidence, and that it would be a significant prudential,\nintellectual, or even moral failure to do otherwise. \u201cOur\npassional nature not only lawfully may, but must, decide an option\nbetween propositions, whenever it is a genuine option that cannot by\nits nature be decided on intellectual grounds\u201d (1896, 11).\n\nAs permissive as this sounds, however, James is by no means writing a\nblank doxastic check. In \u201cThe Will to Believe\u201d he lays out\na series of strict conditions under which an \u201coption\u201d\ncounts as \u201cgenuine\u201d and believing without sufficient\nevidence is permitted or required. For instance, the option must be\nbetween \u201clive\u201d hypotheses\u2014i.e. hypotheses that are\n\u201camong the mind's possibilities\u201d (thus, belief in the\nancient Greek gods is not a live option for us these days). There must\nalso be no compelling evidence one way or the other, the option must\nbe \u201cforced\u201d such that doing nothing also amounts to making\na choice, and the option must concern a \u201cmomentous\u201d issue.\nIn the absence of those conditions, James reverts happily to a broadly\nEvidentialist picture (see Gale 1980, 1999, Kasser and Shah 2006, and\nAikin 2014). (For more on the varieties of Non-Evidentialism, see\n\u00a76 below).\n",
