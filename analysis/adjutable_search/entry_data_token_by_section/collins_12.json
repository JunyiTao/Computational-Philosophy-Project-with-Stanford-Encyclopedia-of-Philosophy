What\nexactly is Collins trying to achieve in this book? Reflecting on the\nfirst two sections of the Discourse, James O\u2019Higgins\nnotes: \n\n\nA good deal of what he wrote can be interpreted as the writing of an\nanti-clerical protestant, insisting on private judgment for the laity.\nA few other passages\u2026such as those from Varo and Socrates, seem\nto imply a bias against Christianity itself, or at least against\nRevelation. (O\u2019Higgins 1970: 89) \n\n\nSome of Collins\u2019 critics accused him of being an atheist. But,\nunless one gives the work an esoteric reading, this hardly seems\nwarranted. Collins is, however, clearly extolling a universal religion\nbased on reason.\n\nThe Discourse received a good number of replies. Steele\ncommented that the author of the Discourse deserved \u201cto\nbe denied the common benefits of air and water\u201d (quoted in\nO\u2019Higgins 1970: 78). The Guardian campaigned against\nthe Discourse. Among the articles it published were some by\nthe young George Berkeley. There is a certain amount of scholarly\ndebate about how effective these replies were. From early on,\nhistorians have often claimed that Richard Bently in his Remarks\nabout a late Discourse of Freethinking delivered a crushing\nrejoinder to Collins. James O\u2019Higgins in his book-length study\nof Collins probably gives the most balanced assessment.\nO\u2019Higgins admits that Bently, on the whole, makes a strictly\nad hominem attack on Collins. He attacked Collins\u2019\nscholarship and accused him of atheism. O\u2019Higgins thinks that\nBently succeeded in showing that \u201cCollins was not the man to\nproduce a critical edition of the Bible\u201d (O\u2019Higgins 1970:\n84). O\u2019Higgins also remarks that Bently correctly points out\nthat Collins did not understand the role of textual variants in\nreducing (rather than increasing) our uncertainty about the meaning of\na text. Since Collins is maintaining that everyone capable of doing so\nshould reason about religious matters, claims that he failed to reason\ncorrectly may have more bite to them than other ad hominem\narguments. But while these are good points, set against the fact that\nBently completely failed to address the main issue of religious\nauthority, this can hardly amount to a crushing rejoinder.\n",
