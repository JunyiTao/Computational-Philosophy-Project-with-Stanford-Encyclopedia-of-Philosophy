    "main_text": "On computational complexity || Distinguishing notions of complexity\n1.3 Distinguishing notions of complexity\nWith these conventions in place, we can now record several respects in which the meaning assigned to the word \u2018complexity\u2019 in computational complexity theory differs from that which is assigned to this term in several other fields.  In computational complexity theory, it is problems \u2013 i.e. infinite sets of finite combinatorial objects like natural numbers, formulas, graphs  \u2013 which are assigned \u2018complexities\u2019.  As we have just seen, such assignments are based on  the time or space complexity of the most efficient algorithms by which membership in a problem can be decided. A distinct notion of complexity is studied in Kolmogorov complexity theory (e.g., Li and Vit\u00e1nyi 1997). Rather than studying the complexity of sets of mathematical objects, this subject attempts to develop a notion of complexity which is applicable to individual combinatorial objects \u2013 e.g. specific natural numbers, formulas, graphs, etc. For instance, the Kolmogorov complexity of a finite string \\(x \\in \\{0,1\\}^*\\) is defined to be the size of the smallest program for a fixed universal Turing machine which outputs \\(x\\) given the empty string as input. In this setting, the \u2018complexity\u2019 of an object is thus viewed as a measure of the extent to which its description can be compressed algorithmically.\nAnother notion of complexity is studied in descriptive complexity theory (e.g., Immerman 1999). Like computational complexity theory, descriptive complexity theory also seeks to classify the complexity of infinite sets of combinatorial objects. However, the \u2018complexity\u2019 of a problem is now measured in terms of the logical resources which are required to define its instances relative to the class of all finite structures for an appropriate signature. As we will see in \n Section 4.4 this approach often yields alternative characterizations of the same classes studied in computational complexity theory. \n\nYet another subject related to computational complexity theory is algorithmic analysis (e.g. Knuth (1973), Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest 2005). Like computational complexity theory, algorithmic analysis studies the complexity of problems and also uses the time and space measures \\(t_M(n)\\) and \\(s_M(x)\\) defined above. The methodology of algorithmic analysis is different from that of computational complexity theory in that it places primary emphasis on gauging the efficiency of specific algorithms for solving a given problem. On the other hand, in seeking to classify problems according to their degree of intrinsic difficulty, complexity theory must consider the efficiency of all algorithms for solving a problem. Complexity theorists thus make greater use of complexity classes such as \\(\\textbf{P},\\textbf{NP}\\), and \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\) whose definitions are robust across different choices of reference model.  In algorithmic analysis, on the other hand, algorithms are often characterized relative to the finer-grained hierarchy of running times \\(\\log_2(n), n, n \\cdot \\log_2(n), n^2, n^3, \\ldots\\) within \n \\(\\textbf{P}\\).[7]\n\n",
