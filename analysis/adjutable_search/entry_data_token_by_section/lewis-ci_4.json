    "main_text": "Empirical Knowledge\n5. Empirical Knowledge\n\nIn AKV, Lewis distinguished three classes of empirical statements.\nFirst, there are expressive statements formulating what is\npresently given in experience and about the truth of which we can be\ncertain (Lewis 1946, 171\u201371, 183, 204, 327). Second, there are\nterminating judgements and statements formulating and\npredicting what we would experience were we to be presented with some\nsensory cue and perform some action. The form of terminating\njudgements is: \n\nIf (or given) \\(S\\), then if \\(A\\), it would be the case\nthat \\(E\\), i.e. \\(((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow E)\\), (Lewis 1946, 184, 205)\n\n\nwhere \\(S, A\\), and \\(E\\) all are formulated in\nexpressive language and concern particular presentable experiences\nabout which we can be certain, and \u201c\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u201d is neither\nlogical entailment nor material implication but what Lewis calls\n\u201creal connection\u201d that gives rise to subjunctive or\ncounterfactual conditionals. Real connections (an example of which are\ncausal connections) are inductively established correlations by virtue\nof which one observable item may indicate another. Terminating\njudgements, as expressing a general claim about a repeatable mode of\naction and a sequent experience, Lewis (1946, 219) claimed, are not\ndecisively verifiable but are decisively falsifiable. Third, there are\nnon-terminating judgements, including objective\njudgment, that are confirmable and disconfirmable by experience,\nthanks to their sense meaning, but are neither decisively verifiable\nnor decisively falsifiable. \n\nObjective judgements include not only perceptual judgements like\n\u201cThere is a white piece of paper before me\u201d in which we\nconceptualize and interpret a given experience by relating it to other\npossible experiences, but also a vast number of other beliefs about\nthe material world supported by our perceptual beliefs, e.g.\nstatements about the future outcome of space explorations, or\ngeneralizations like \u201cAll men have noses\u201d, or non-analytic\nstatements about theoretical entities. Objective judgements\ndon\u2019t strictly imply terminating judgements of the form\n\\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow E\\) (Lewis 1946, 237).\nInstead, the sense meaning of objective judgments consists of an\nindefinitely large set of general probabilistically qualified\nconditional judgements of the form \u201cIf it were the case that\n\\(S \\amp A\\), then, in all likelihood,\n\\(E\\)\u201d (Lewis, 1946, 237). Any objective perceptual\njudgement \\(P\\) thus analytically entails and is entailed by, an\nindefinitely large set of hypothetical or conditional judgements of\nthe form,\n\n\\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\),\n\nwhere \\((h)E\\) means that, in all probability\n\\(E\\), and expresses, not the probability of the conditional\n\\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow E)\\), but \u201ca\nrelation of probability\u201d between \\(E, S\\), and\n\\(A\\). (Lewis 1946, 250)\n\n\nNone of these conditional judgements are decisively verifiable or\nfalsifiable by experience. (Lewis (1946, 247) sometimes calls the\nstatements that constitute the empirical content of objective\nstatements terminating judgements nonetheless). However, as expressing\nreal connections, they are nonetheless confirmable and disconfirmable\nby experience, as are the objective judgements whose sense meaning\nthey constitute. \n\nFor example, to use Lewis\u2019s examples, suppose \\(P\\) is\n\u201ca sheet of paper lies before me\u201d. Its analytic\nentailments might include, \u201cIf \\(S_1\\) (I were to\nseem to see a sheet of paper before me) and \\(A_1\\) (I\nwere to seem to move my eyes), then, probably, \\(E_1\\)\n(I would seem to see the sheet of paper displaced)\u201d, as well as\n\u201cIf \\(S_2\\) (I were to seem to feel paper with my\nfingers), and \\(A_2\\) (I were to seem to pick it up and\ntear it), then, probably, \\(E_2\\) (I would seem to see\nor feel torn paper)\u201d, and so on. On the other hand, suppose\n\\(P\\) is \u201cThere is a doorknob before me\u201d. Its truth\nmight then entail the truth of a complex set of conditionals like\n\u201cIf I were to seem to see a doorknob, and were to seem to reach\nout towards it and grasp it, then, probably, I would seem to feel\nsomething hard and round\u201d, etc.\n\nIn MWO Lewis says in one place not only that appearances are\nphysically conditioned by objects and the physical circumstances of\none\u2019s body and perception, which is certainly a reason for\nwanting to know such physical facts, but that these conditions enter\ninto the basic understanding or meaning of material object statements:\n\u201cIt is such conditions which are expressed in the\n\u2018if\u2019 clause of those \u2018If \u2026 then\n\u2026\u2019 propositions in which the predictions implicit in an\ninterpretation may be made explicit\u201d (Lewis 1929, 286). However,\nin AKV he explicitly rejects this position: \u201cThus those\nconditions which are directly pertinent to a confirmation and\ngenuinely ascertainable are not objective facts but must be included\namongst the given appearances. They must be items of direct\npresentation; and we might think of them as already covered by\n\u2018\\(S\\)\u2019 in our paradigm: \\(S\\) being given, if\n\\(A\\) then, with probability \\(M, E\\)\u201d (Lewis 1946,\n246). The result is that \\(S\\) in Lewis\u2019 paradigm strictly\nspeaking won\u2019t just include the visual presentation of a\ndoorknob, for example, but the appearance of daylight or the feeling\nof being clear headed as part of the whole presentation. Arguably,\nthat, together with the probability qualifier, allows him to avoid\nQuine\u2019s worries about circumstances of perception and the\ntestable implications of empirical beliefs (Lewis 1946, 242\u20136).\n\n\nNo number of successful or failed tests will render the objective\njudgement true or false with theoretical certainty. However, Lewis\nthought the principle of inverse probabilities meant that the\njudgement can be highly probable with a few positive confirmations,\neven practically certain, in so far as the probability of \\(P\\) when\n\\(S\\) and \\(A\\) and \\(E\\) obtain may approach certainty as the\nimprobability of \\(E\\) approaches certainty when \\(S\\) and \\(A\\) and\nnot \\(P\\) obtain. The principle also explains why further tests may\ncontinue to increase our warranted assurance in the judgement even\nmore, though not as dramatically as earlier tests increased our\nwarrant (Lewis 1946, 190\u201392). Since confirming and gaining\nassurance that \\(P\\) gives us assurance in all the predictions that\n\\(P\\) entails about future experience (Lewis 1946, 239), the principle\nof inverse probabilities may explain how we can act on these\npredictions with increasing confidence. Even though experience of\ninstances of \\(S\\) and \\(A\\) and \\(E\\) can confirm and increase the\nprobability of one sensory conditional entailed by \\(P\\) independent\nof direct experiential confirmation of the other sensory conditionals\nentailed by \\(P\\), experiential confirmation of one conditional increases the\nprobability of the others, and vice versa (Lewis 1946, 348,\nfootnote 6). \n\nOur empirical knowledge of objects and objective events and\nproperties, the generalizations they support concerning patterns of\nobjective events and properties, and the use we make of all this for\nfurther inductions, has a complex \u201cmany-storied\ncharacter\u201d. Nonetheless, the \u201cwhole edifice still rests at\nbottom on these primitive generalizations which we make in terms of\ndirect experience\u201d (Lewis 1946, 261). (Lewis (1929, 332; 1946,\n261) contrasted these primitive generalizations that underlie our\nobjective beliefs with what he says we normally call \u201cempirical\ngeneralizations\u201d that concern patterns of objective events and\nmay formulate natural laws supporting causal explanations.) However,\nthe empirical justification for these primitive generalizations and\nultimately for our objective beliefs can\u2019t rest on current sense\nexperience alone and requires evidence concerning the past. At the\nsame time, what is given to us isn\u2019t the past itself about which\nwe can never be certain, but just current sense presentation and\ncurrent recollection or sense of past experience. \n\nLewis appreciated the problem memory posed for his epistemology much\nmore clearly in AKV than in MWO. In AKV, Lewis (1946, 334) argued that\nwhatever we ostensibly remember, whether as explicit recollection or\nmerely in our sense of the past, is prima facie credible just\nbecause so remembered. So there are data of sense presentation and\nalso data of \u201cseeming to remember\u201d or \u201cpresent\nmemory\u201d (Lewis 1946, 353, 354) that constitute our ultimate\nevidence, and it is only through the latter and the principle of\nmemorial prima facie credibility that empirical\ngeneralizations and the beliefs they support can be inductively\nsupported by premises about past experience as well as about directly\napprehended present experience. Further the credibility of our\nrecollections, together with the whole range of empirical beliefs more\nor less dependent on them, can be solidified and increased through the\nmutual support or congruence of the whole, or can be diminished\nthrough incongruence. \n\nA set of beliefs is congruent for Lewis (1946, 338) when the\nantecedent probability of each is increased by the assumption of the\ntruth of the rest. A physical object statement \\(P\\) and the set\nof sensory conditionals that constitute its content form a congruent\nset, as we have seen. Indeed, by virtue of exhausting the empirical\ncontent of \\(P\\), Lewis (1946, 348\u20139, footnote 6) thinks\nthe sensory conditionals constitute a congruent set by themselves. In\nany case, the degree of warrant enjoyed by the various elements of a\nmature system of empirical belief, especially one that counts as\nknowledge, depends on the inferential support the elements\nprovide each other and the total empirical and memorial data present.\nHowever, Lewis emphasizes that for the members of a congruent system\nto have any degree of probability, \u201cit is absolutely requisite\nthat some at least of the set of statements possess a degree of\ncredibility antecedent to and independent of the remainder of those in\nquestion, and derivable from the relation of them to direct\nexperience\u201d (Lewis 1946, 339).\n\nAs a result, the \u201cwhole\nintricate network\u201d of the empirically credible, Lewis notes,\n\u201cwill be constituted at bottom by linkages of ground and\nconsequence, which is in general a one way relation\u201d (Lewis\n1946, 351). Disentangling the network would reveal particular linkages\nof prior probability relationships that would confer some\ndegree of initial probability not just on what we recall of past\nexperience but on simple generalizations from past experience and the\nexpectations of future experiences and thus interpretations of\nexperience these recollections inductively support, even in the\nhypothetical absence of (other) objective beliefs with which they are\ncongruent. Moreover, the recollections that support them and form part\nof an overall congruent system must have some degree of credibility\nindependent of each other and the rest. The improbability of\nindependently probable congruent recollections all being true were the\nbeliefs they inferentially support and that inferentially support them\nnot true makes it unlikely that they are illusions of memory and\nincreases the initial probability enjoyed antecedently by the\nrecollections and what they support (Lewis 1946, 352\u20133).\nSpelling out the antecedent and independent probability constraints is\ntricky, to which Lewis devotes an extended discussion (Lewis 1946,\n332\u201357). \n\nThe principle of the prima facie credibility of mnemic\npresentation of past experience can\u2019t itself be justified\ninductively for Lewis, on pain of circularity. Nor did he think it is\nsimply a postulate \u2014 something we have to assume for empirical\nknowledge to be possible. Instead, he argued that it is constitutive\nof the lived world of experience and something for which there is no\nmeaningful alternative. Sceptical alternatives designed to undermine\nthe principle are ones that are inaccessible to knowledge and thus\nones for which there is no criterion in experience. So it is an\n\u201canalytic statement\u201d that the past is knowable, and a\nsimilar claim was made for the relevance of past experience to the\nfuture, and thus for the knowability of empirical reality. The\nphilosophical problem for Lewis (1946, 360\u20132) is to formulate\ncorrectly the criteria that \u201cdelimit empirical reality and\nexplicate our sense of it\u201d. \n\nIn MWO, he defended induction in more detail by arguing that not every\nprediction is compatible with an evidence base, and that successive\nrevision of one\u2019s predictions in the light of new experience\ncan\u2019t help but make for more successful predictions (Lewis 1929,\n367, 386). Nelson Goodman\u2019s well known \u201cgrue\u201d\nexample (Goodman 1955) poses problems for the relevance of the first\nclaim and the force of the second. At other times, Lewis simply\nfollowed Hans Reichenbach in claiming that we can be assured only that\nif any procedures will achieve success in prediction, inductive ones\nwill, without clearly distinguishing that claim from any attempt at an\nanalytic justification of induction.\n\nRationally credible or warranted or justified belief, Lewis thought,\nis probable on the evidence, but the presentation of his views on\nprobability was underdeveloped in MWO, and complex, and sometimes\nconfusing, in AKV. In AKV, Lewis defended an a priori account\nof probability or what he sometimes called expectation.\nHowever, he rejected the Principle of Indifference often associated\nwith a priori accounts, understood as the principle that in\nthe absence of any reason for thinking one a priori\npossibility more likely than another, they are equiprobable (Lewis\n1946, 306\u2013314). The expectation or probability\n\\(a/b\\) of a proposition \\(P\\) is always relative\nto some set of empirical data or premises \\(D\\). The expectation\ncorresponds to an a priori valid estimate of the frequency of\nsome property mentioned in \\(P\\) in some reference class\nmentioned in \\(P\\) , which estimate is derived from data or\npremises \\(D\\), given the a priori valid principles of\nprobabilistic inference, including the principles of induction.\nHypothetical or conditional probability statements that are a\npriori valid license valid probabilistic inferences from premises\nabout evidence or data to probabilistic conclusions. However, for\nLewis, both hypothetical and categorical probability are always\nrelativized to an evidence base, despite his occasional apparent talk\nof a priori valid probability statements as licensing\ninferences from empirical evidence to a (detachable) conclusion\n\u201cProbably, P\u201d.\n\nLewis rejected the view that probabilities are empirically based\nestimates of the limiting value of the frequency of instances of a\nproperty in a population, and thus expressed in non-terminating\njudgments. First, he thought that any attempt to define probabilities\nas the ratio of instances of one property among instances of another\nproperty as the latter approaches infinity would make probability\njudgments empirically untestable. Second, he argued that, if\nprobability judgements were empirical frequency claims, then the\nprobability judgements would themselves only be probable, something\nthat can\u2019t be coherently accounted for. Nonetheless, Lewis\nrecognized the need to assure ourselves rationally that the frequency\nas validly estimated from the data is closely in accord with the\nactual frequency and that there is nothing in the case at hand\naffecting the occurrence of the property which isn\u2019t taken into\naccount in the specification of the reference class. Lewis dubbed this\nthe reliability of the determination of probability or\nexpectation. He thought that reliability is a function of the adequacy\nof data (e.g. size of sample), the uniformity with which the frequency\nof some property in the data as a whole also holds for subsets of the\ndata, and the proximateness or degree of resemblance of the\ncase at hand in P to the data, all of which he also thought are\nlogical relations.\n\nThus, in AKV, Lewis (1946, 305) claimed that the full statement of a\nprobability judgement should be of the form \u201cThat \\(c\\),\nhaving property \\(F\\), will also have property \\(G\\), is\ncredible on data \\(D\\), with expectation \\(a/b\\)\nand reliability \\(R\\)\u201d, and is assertable in whatever sense\n\\(D\\) is. The judgement is valid when, in accordance with the\na priori rules of probability and the correct rules of\njudging reliability, \\(D\\) gives the estimate\n\\(a/b\\) of the frequency of \\(F\\)s among\n\\(G\\)s, and \\(D\\)\u2019s adequacy, uniformity, and\nproximateness to the case in point, yields reliability \\(R\\). A\nvalid probability judgement is true when \\(D\\) is true, and is a\ncategorical rather than a hypothetical judgement when \\(D\\) is\ncategorically asserted as true. The assertion of the empirical data\n\\(D\\) is the only empirical element in the probability judgement,\nwhich otherwise has no testable implications for experience. However,\nthe belief \\(P\\), that \\(c\\) which has \\(F\\) is also\n\\(G\\), is an empirical belief that may be rationally credible,\nempirically justified, and warranted, in so far as \\(D\\) is given\nand the degree of assurance or belief corresponds to an a\npriori degree of probability (expectation) of \\(P\\) on\n\\(D\\) that is sufficiently reliable. Further, acceptance of\n\\(P\\) counts as empirical knowledge in so far as,\nfirstly, \\(P\\) is true, secondly, the degree of probability or\nexpectation of \\(P\\) on \\(D\\) is sufficiently high as to\napproach practical certainty, and, thirdly, \\(D\\) consists of all\nrelevant data (Lewis, 1946, 314\u201315).\n\nIt is important to distinguish probabilistically qualified\ncounterfactual statements of the form \\((S \\amp A)\n\\rightarrow(h)E\\) from a priori probability\nstatements of the form \\(\u201c\\text{Prob}(E, \\text{ on } S \\text{ and }\nA) \\gt .5\u201d.\\) Both express conditional probabilities.\nHowever, the former express \u2018real\u2019 connections knowable by\ninduction from past experience (Lewis 1946, 250). They constitute the\nanalytically entailed consequences of an objective material objective\nstatement \\(P\\), but can\u2019t themselves be analytic truths.\nThe latter, on the other hand, if true, are analytically true,\nknowable a priori, with zero intension, and entailed by any\nstatement whatsoever, and so can hardly constitute the empirical\nmeaning of contingently true material object statements. Yet, apart\nfrom denying that \u201c\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u201d can be understood either as\nmaterial implication or strict implication, Lewis had little to say in\nprint about what the truth conditions of subjunctive or counterfactual\nconditionals are. Murphey (2005, 332) quotes correspondence from Lewis\ncomplaining that Goodman and Chisholm in their writings miss the\nobvious interpretation of \u201cIf \\(A\\) were the case, then\n\\(B\\) would be the case\u201d, namely that \\(A\\) plus other\npremises of the (actual or hypothetical) case inductively justify the\nconclusion \\(B\\). Lewis needs to say more then about what, if\nanything, distinguishes \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow E\\) from \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow \n(h)E\\). Is it the degree of probability of \\(E\\)\non the premises, practically certain in the former case, only somewhat\nprobable in the latter? Another problem is to interpret the remark so\nas to avoid turning counterfactuals into a priori analytic\ntruths, albeit ones concerning probabilities. Nonetheless, Lewis\nemphasized their importance, and the importance of the real\nconnections they express, for the possibility of realism about the\nmaterial world and the rejection of any sort of idealism or view that\nphysical objects are simply mind-dependent collections of experiences\n(Lewis 1946, 226, Lewis 1955, in Lewis 1970). The sensory conditionals\n\\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow E\\) and \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) can be true, as can the\nmaterial object statement \\(P\\) that entails them, quite apart\nfrom the truth of the expressive statements \\(S\\) and \\(A\\).\n\n\nChisholm (1948) raised an important challenge to Lewis\u2019 claim\nthat a physical object statement \\(P\\) entails a set of\ncounterfactual statements expressing claims about what experiences one\nwould have or would be likely to have were one to (seem to) carry out\ncertain tests upon being presented with certain sensory cues. If\n\\(P\\) entails \\(T\\), then for any \\(Q\\) consistent with\n\\(P, P\\) and \\(Q\\) also entail \\(T\\). However,\nChisholm argued, for any material object statement \\(P\\) and for\nany sensory conditional \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow \n(h)E\\), there will be some other material object\nstatement \\(M\\) about the circumstances of perception that is\nconsistent with \\(P\\), such that \\(P\\) and \\(M\\) can\nboth be true while \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow \n(h)E\\) is false. For example, suppose \\(P\\) is\n\u201cThere is a doorknob before one\u201d and \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) is \u201cIf one were to\nseem to see a doorknob and have the experience of reaching out with\none\u2019s hand, then, in all likelihood, one would seem to feel\nsomething hard and round\u201d, and \\(M\\) is \u201cOne\u2019s\nfingertips have been permanently anaesthetized\u201d. (Expanding the\nunderstanding of \\(S\\) to include sensory correlates of\ncircumstances of perception, as Lewis (1946, 245\u20136) suggests,\npresumably just requires expanding the understanding of \\(M\\)\nwith some imagination.) A material object statement like \\(P\\),\ntherefore, doesn\u2019t entail sensory conditionals like \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) . Instead of\nLewis\u2019 empiricism about the meaning and justification of\nmaterial object statements, Chisholm proposed that our spontaneous\nperceptual beliefs about the world, e.g. that one is seeing a\ndoorknob, are prima facie justified just by virtue of being\nsuch spontaneous perceptual beliefs, quite apart from any inductive\njustification from present and past experience that might be\nreconstructed. Lewis\u2019 own defence of the prima facie\ncredibility of memory, Chisholm thought, prepared the way for his\nalternative. Quine (1969), on the other hand, thought that\nChisholm\u2019s problem just shows that what have consequences for\nexperience and are tested by experience are never individual material\nobject statements in isolation from each other but only sets of them\nor theories. Quine saved empiricism by drawing a holistic moral from\nthe sort of problem Chisholm posed. \n\nIn a rare reply to critics, Lewis (1948, reprinted in Lewis 1970,\n322\u20133) objected that Chisholm had misunderstood the implication\nof the probability qualifier. The familiar rule \u201cIf \\(P\\)\nentails \\(T\\), then for any \\(Q, P\\) and \\(Q\\)\nentail \\(T\\)\u201d doesn\u2019t apply, he claims, when\n\\(T\\) is any kind of probability statement. \\(E\\) not being\nprobable on \\(P\\) and \\(M\\) and \\(S\\) and \\(A\\) is\nperfectly consistent with \\(E\\) being probable on \\(P\\) and\n\\(S\\) and \\(A\\) and its truth doesn\u2019t undermine the\ntruth of the claim that \\(P\\) entails \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\). Chisholm might respond that\nthe familiar rule is simply a consequence of the meaning of entailment\nor strict implication, according to which it is not possible that\n\\(P\\) and not \\(T\\). Furthermore, Lewis isn\u2019t simply\nasserting that \\(E\\) is probable on \\(P\\) and \\(S\\) and\n\\(A\\), but, as Lewis (1946, 248\u201350) himself says in his\nformal summary of his view, that the subjunctive conditional\n\\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) is an\nanalytic consequence of \\(P\\), at least in the way \\(X\\)\nis coloured is a consequence of \\(X\\) is red, and is\n(strictly) implied by \\(P\\), as a conclusion to a premise, even\nif not solely by reference to the \u201crules of deductive\nlogic\u201d. Of course, \u201c\\(P\\) strictly implies\n\\(((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E)\\)\u201d\nitself strictly implies \u201c\\((P \\amp S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) \u201d (but not\nconversely), and neither is contradicted by \u201c\\((P \\amp S \\amp A \\amp M) \\rightarrow\\)\nnot\\((h)E\\)\u201d. However, \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) expresses in its own right\nan \u201cin all likelihood\u201d relation of probability between\n\\(E\\) and the possibly counterfactual \\(S\\) and \\(A\\)\n(Lewis 1946, 250), quite apart from \\(P\\), a relation that, for\nLewis, holds when it is in accord with the a priori rules of\nprobability (including inductive inference) relative to the empirical\ndata D (Lewis 1946, 305,314), e.g. in the simplest case, recollections\nof past instances of \\(E\\) usually following \\(S\\) and\n\\(A\\). Chisholm\u2019s challenge seems to remain, whether it is\npossible for \\(P\\) and \\(M\\) to be true and \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) false. \n\nNonetheless, as Lewis (1948, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 318\u2013321)\nnotes in a breakdown of cases, the probabilistically qualified\nsubjunctive \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow \n(h)E\\) (\u201cIf one were to seem to see a doorknob\nand have the experience of reaching out with one\u2019s hand, then,\nin all likelihood, one would seem to feel something hard and\nround\u201d) is compatible with occasional failures of prediction.\nThus, he can point out that in cases where the truth of \\(M\\)\n(\u201cOne\u2019s fingertips have been permanently\nanaesthetized\u201d) somehow doesn\u2019t affect the sensory cues\nand is recent enough to have not (yet) significantly altered the\npatterns in the data D, e.g. of instances of \\(E\\) usually\nfollowing \\(S\\) and \\(A, (S \\amp A)\n\\rightarrow(h)E\\) remains true when \\(P\\)\n(\u201cThere is a doorknob before one\u201d) and \\(M\\) are\ntrue. That\u2019s because in such cases \\((S \\amp A)\n\\rightarrow(h)E\\) is still supported by the extant data of\nexperience and memory D in accord with the a priori rules,\ndespite the truth of \\(M\\), and the reliability of that\nprobability assessment is still warranted by the data and rules for\njudging reliability, although \\(M\\) might affect the actual\nreliability of the probability assessment in the cases at hand, and\nmight eventually affect the actual frequency of \\(E\\) over time.\nMuch depends here on the understanding of probability statements and\nconditionals, and Lewis\u2019 account isn\u2019t without its\ntensions. In different (but more normal) cases where \\(M\\) does\nmanifest itself by affecting the sensory cues, making \\(S_1\\)\ntrue, for example, one seems to have tingly, numb fingertips, in\naddition to \\(S\\), one seems to see a doorknob, \\((S \\amp S_1 \\amp A) \\rightarrow\\) not \\((h)E\\) might\nindeed be true, but, as Lewis would emphasize, it is consistent with\n\\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow(h)E\\). Finally,\nin yet different (and bizarre) cases where the longstanding truth of\n\\(M\\) when \\(P\\) was true in the past didn\u2019t affect\nthe sensory cues but significantly affected the pattern with\n\\(E\\), making D1, e.g. \\(E\\) not usually following\n\\(S\\) and \\(A\\) in recalled instances, the actual empirical\ndata, rather than D as in the first case, it seems that D1\nwouldn\u2019t have led us to expect \\(E\\) upon \\(S\\) and\n\\(A\\). However, that expectation is constitutive in part of our\nobjective thought \\(P\\), and thus, as Firth (1950) suggests, the\nfailure of the sensory conditional \\((S \\amp A)\n\\rightarrow(h)E\\) to hold relative to D1 is arguably\nirrelevant to its entailment by the thought we express by\n\u201cP\u201d. In any case, one might wonder how sensory\nconditionals like \\((S \\amp A) \\rightarrow \n(h)E\\), which, for Lewis, express generalizations\nconcerning what any one would (likely) experience and which must do so\nif they are to provide the empirical content of objective judgements\nabout an interpersonal material world, can nonetheless be warranted\ninductively by premises concerning only patterns in the personal\nexperience of the putative knower, in particular how their probability\ncan be judged to be sufficiently reliable, without reference to any\nbackground beliefs about how the material world interacts with persons\ngenerally and their bodies to affect experience. \n\nYet, if Lewis were simply to drop the analytic entailment claim that\ngives probabilistically qualified sensory conditionals like \\((S \\amp\nA) \\rightarrow(h)E\\) a privileged semantic role, and rest content with\nthe various consistent probability statements relating \\(E\\) to \\(P\\),\n\\(S\\), \\(A\\), and \\(M\\), the character of his empiricism would become\npuzzling. If the consistent relative probability statements in\nquestion are the probabilistically qualified subjunctive conditionals,\n\\(\u201c(P \\amp S \\amp A \\rightarrow(h)E\u201d\\) and\n\\(\u201c(P \\amp S \\amp A \\amp M) \\rightarrow \\text{not}(h)E)\u201d,\\) then the statements in question are empirical\npropositions justified by induction. The justification for them thus\nwill presuppose prior knowledge of the truth of material object\nstatements like \\(P\\) and \\(M\\), perhaps in the way Chisholm suggests,\nrather than explain why and how we can know such propositions solely\non the basis of present and past experience of the given. On the other\nhand, if the relative probability statements are\na priori analytic statements in their own right, then it is\nthe total set of such statements that will constitute the empirical\nmeaning of \\(P\\), statements like\n\n\\[\n \u201c\\text{Prob}(E, \\text{ given } P \\amp S \\amp A \\amp M) \\lt .5\u201d\n\\] \n\nas much as\n\n\\[\n\u201c\\text{Prob}(E, \\text{ given } P \\amp S \\amp A\\gt .5\u201d,\n\\]\n\n\nthus including statements containing other\nmaterial object statements like \\(M\\). Even when the relativization to\nother background material object statements isn\u2019t explicit, the\nprobability statement would seem to be implicitly relative to some\nbackground assumption of material normality. In other words, Lewis\nwould have abandoned reductionism for Quine\u2019s holistic\nconclusion that individual material object statements like \\(P\\),\napart from other material object statements, have \u201cno fund of\nexperiential implications to call their own\u201d (Quine 1969,\n79).\n\nAs noted earlier, Lewis (1929, 286) and Lewis (1936b) flirts with a\nversion of Quine\u2019s alternative. However, in AKV and in his reply\nto Chisholm, Lewis clearly repudiates it: if Chisholm were right that\n\u201cno statement of objective fact had consequences for direct\nexperience without further premises specifying objective conditions of\nperception\u201d, then, Lewis says, \u201cthe type of empiricism of\nwhich my account is one variant\u2014verification-theories and\nconfirmation-theories\u2014will be altogether indefensible\u201d\n(Lewis 1948, reprinted in Lewis 1970, 318). The result, he adds, would\nbe a fatally flawed \u201ccoherence theory of empirical truth\u201d\nthat leaves us with \u201cnothing..but skepticism\u201d. \n",
