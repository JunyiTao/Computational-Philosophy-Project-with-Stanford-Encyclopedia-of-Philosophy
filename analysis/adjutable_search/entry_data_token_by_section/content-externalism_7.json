    "main_text": "Extended Mind\n5. Extended Mind\n\nThe expression extended mind was coined by Clark and Chalmers (1998), but essentially the same view has gone by a variety of names,\nincluding \u201cactive externalism\u201d, \u201cextended cognition\u201d (both Clark and Chalmers 1998), \u201cvehicle externalism\u201d (Hurley 1998), \u201cenvironmentalism\u201d (Rowlands 1999),\nand \u201ccognitive integration\u201d (Menary 2007). While this variegation in nomenclature is unimportant in itself, it is important\nto (a) to distinguish extended mind from other views with which it might be confused, and (b) capture the significant internal variegation in views that might be classified as versions of extended mind. First, however, the general idea needs to be delineated (see Menary 2010 for a collection of thematic papers, both pro and con).\n\nMental content is not free-floating. Wherever there is mental content\nthere is something that has it\u2014a vehicle of content.\nMental states (belief, desires, hopes, and fears, etc.) are\nnatural candidates for vehicles of content. So too are mental\nacts (believing, desiring, hoping, fearing, etc.). As a\nrough, initial approximation, extended mind is the view\nthat not all mental states or acts are exclusively located inside the\nperson who believes, desires, hopes, fears, and so on. Rather, some\nmental states or acts are, in part, constituted by factors\n(e.g., structures, processes) that are located outside the biological\nboundaries of the individuals that have them. Thus, extended mind differs from content externalism not merely in being about mental vehicles rather than mental contents, but also in being committed to a claim of external location rather than simply external\nindividuation. If extended mind is true, some vehicles of\ncontent are not, entirely, located inside the biological boundaries of\nindividuals that have them. Rather, they are, partly, constituted by,\nor are composed of, factors that lie outside those boundaries. \n\nThe distinction between states and acts is, in the context of this\nform of externalism, a significant one, and the general idea of\nextended mind can be developed in two quite different ways\ndepending on whether we think of the vehicles of content as states or\nas acts. Thinking of the vehicles of content as states leads to a\nstate-oriented version of extended mind. Thinking of\nthese vehicles as acts leads to a process-oriented\nalternative.\n",
