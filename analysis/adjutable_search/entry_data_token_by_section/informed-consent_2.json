    "main_text": "Why informed consent? || Protection\n2.1 Protection\n\nThe simplest rationale for the informed consent requirement is that it\nprotects study participants\u2019 and patients\u2019 health and\nwelfare. It protects participants from investigators\u2019\noverzealous attempts to promote science and personal careers, even on\nparticipants\u2019 backs, and it also protects regular patients from\nneglectful clinicians or from overconfident, but often wrong,\n paternalistic\n ones. While many moral doctrines oppose harming study participants or\npatients, bioethicists\u2019 expositions of this instrumental\nrationale typically echo utilitarian philosopher\n John Stuart Mill,\n for whom \u201cOver himself, over his own body and mind, the\nindividual is sovereign\u201d (Mill 1990, 135; see also ch. 3). They\nexplain that patients and research participants are typically the best\njudges of their own good and mind it far more than the doctor does,\neven when the doctor is convinced that he or she acts in their best\ninterests (compare Mill 1990, e.g. 215). They add that doctors\u2019\ntraining scarcely prepares them to know patients\u2019 distinctive\nnon-medical interests.\n\nHowever, insofar as the goal is to protect patients and trial\nparticipants from harm, why honor informed consent requirements when\nmany physicians and patients\u2014a Condorcet\n\u201cjury\u201d\u2014are fairly certain that a particular patient\nor participant is not making a decision that furthers her own medical\ninterests? In clinical care, for example, patients\u2019 biases and\nignorance about medicine arguably tend to exceed those of physicians;\nsometimes, patients refuse interventions that everyone\nconsiders best for them\u2014even family, friends, and these patients\nthemselves, before a change of heart. In the future, patients may\nrefuse interventions that highly-reliable algorithms predict patients\nlike them to be glad to have undergone. Indeed, some patients\nknowingly jeopardize their own health in the name of religious or\nmoral commitments. This being the case, why is it important\u2014as\nit seems to many of us and as is enshrined in law\u2014to honor the\nrequirement of informed consent? For example, why honor the\nrequirement when a fully capacitated Jehovah\u2019s Witness refuses a\nblood transfusion on religious grounds? Why honor it when health is\nnot at stake, for example, in experiments on stored tissue? Finally,\nspecifically from a utilitarian standpoint, why honor the requirement\non occasions when it seems to set back collective health, for example,\nwhen we cannot develop a new drug that would help many, because no one\nis altruistic enough to consent to participate in its risky study?\n",
