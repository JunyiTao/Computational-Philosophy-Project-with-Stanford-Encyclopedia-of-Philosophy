    "main_text": "Biographical Note\n1. Biographical Note\n\nWesley Charles Salmon was born in Detroit on 9 August 1925, to Wallis,\na mechanical and electrical engineer, and Ruth Springer Salmon, a\nschoolteacher. After completing primary and secondary school in\nDetroit, and studying at Wayne University (now Wayne State University)\nfrom 1943\u201344, in 1944 Salmon moved to the University of Chicago.\nTaken with admiration for the charismatic minister of his\nfamily\u2019s Methodist church, Salmon entered the University of\nChicago Divinity School with the intention to become a minister\nhimself. However, as he writes in the autobiographical note published\nin What? Where? When? Why? (1982), once in Chicago he left\nhis \u201cbelief in virtually every tenet of Christianity, as well as\nall confidence in the social value of religion\u201d (Salmon 1982c:\n281). He then decided to turn to philosophy and in 1947 obtained his\nMA in Philosophy with a thesis on Whitehead\u2019s conception of\nfreedom.\n\nIn Chicago, Salmon was quite unhappy with the Thomistic focus of the\nPhilosophy department, where the scientifically oriented philosophy he\nfavored was somewhat disregarded, in spite of the presence there of\nRudolf Carnap, with whom at that time he did not have much\ninterchange. Closer interaction between them took place in 1963, while\nSalmon was visiting the University of Minnesota Center for Philosophy\nof Science for the Winter and Spring terms, and was given the\nopportunity to pay a one week visit to Carnap in Los Angeles, together\nwith Herbert Feigl, and Grover Maxwell. That visit was the occasion\nfor daily discussions on the nature of confirmation and inductive\nlogic. Such a stimulating exchange fueled many writings, including the\nmasterpiece The Foundations of Scientific Inference (1967a),\nwhose fiftieth anniversary edition was re-published in 2017 with an\nintroduction by Christopher Hitchcock.\n\nAfter receiving his MA, Salmon decided to move to UCLA. Although he\nclaimed to have taken that decision attracted by the warm Californian\nclimate, his choice proved decisive, because there he encountered Hans\nReichenbach, who supervised his Ph.D. dissertation on John Venn, and\nwho exercised a dominant influence on all of his subsequent work.\nAfter obtaining his Ph.D. in 1950, Salmon held teaching positions at\nWashington State College; UCLA; Northwestern University, and Brown\nUniversity.\n\nIn 1963 Salmon moved to the recently founded (1960) department of\nHistory and Philosophy of Science of Indiana University, where his\nphilosophical attitude underwent an important turn, that he so\ndescribes:\n\n\nAt Indiana, for the first time, I found myself dealing with graduate\nstudents and colleagues who had strong scientific backgrounds and a\nfair degree of scientific sophistication. It became essential for me\nto treat philosophy of science, not as a discipline looking inward\nupon other branches of philosophy, but as one which looks outward\ntoward the various scientific disciplines. [\u2026] I came to the\nconviction, which I still hold, that philosophy which remains out of\ncontact with other disciplines runs the great risk of becoming quite\nsterile. (Salmon 1982c: 282)\n\n\nAs a result of such developments, besides continuing to work on the\nissues which had always been on his mind, namely induction,\nconfirmation, probability and the nature of scientific inference,\nSalmon became deeply interested in the philosophy of space and time,\npublishing the introductory book Space, Time, and Motion\n(1975a), which can be considered a pearl of clarity; the collection\nZeno\u2019s Paradoxes (1970a); and a number of subsequent\npapers. During his years at Indiana University Salmon started working\nalso on explanation, a subject that remained at the heart of his\nproduction for the rest of his life.\n\nAfter his first marriage ended in divorce, in 1971 Salmon married\nMerrilee Ashby, herself a philosopher of science. In 1973 Salmon and\nhis wife left Indiana and took positions at the University of Arizona,\nto stay there until 1981 when they both moved to the University of\nPittsburgh. There, in 1983 Salmon was appointed University Professor\nat the Philosophy department as a successor of Carl Gustav Hempel, a\nposition he held until his retirement in 1999. In Pittsburgh\nphilosophy of science was flourishing, thanks to a large community\nbelonging not only to the department of Philosophy, but also the\ndepartment of History and Philosophy of Science, the Center for\nPhilosophy of Science, and the Philosophy department of Carnegie\nMellon University. As a member of such a lively philosophical\ncommunity Salmon enjoyed a most congenial atmosphere for twenty\nextremely productive years, leading to the publication of the book\nScientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World\n(1984), a milestone of the literature on scientific explanation and\nthe apex of Salmon\u2019s work on the topic, the collection, edited\nwith Philip Kitcher, Scientific Explanation (1989), which\nincluded as a chapter the essay \u201cFour Decades of Scientific\nExplanation\u201d, to be published one year later as a book (1990a),\nand a long series of articles which later merged into the two\ncollections Causality and Explanation (1998) and Reality\nand Rationality, edited by P. Dowe and M.H. Salmon, which\nappeared posthumously in 2005.\n\nAlong the years Salmon gave lectures and courses as a visiting\nprofessor in many universities and other prestigious institutions\naround the world, including the university of Bologna, where in 1988\nhe delivered a lecture course on \u201cForty years of scientific\nexplanation\u201d; the university of Melbourne (1978), and Kyoto\nUniversity, where in the Spring 2000 he last taught for one term.\nSalmon was also very active in promoting philosophy of science, and\nserved as President of the Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of\nScience division of the International Union of History and Philosophy\nof Science (now IUHPST: International Union of History and Philosophy\nof Science and Technology) from 1996 to 2000.\n\nOn 22 April 2001 Salmon died in a car accident on his way home from a\nfamily visit in Indiana.\n\nFrom his first book Logic (1963a), which was translated into\nSpanish, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, French, Portuguese, and German,\nto his last publication, the article \u201cThe Causal Structure of\nthe World\u201d (2010), Salmon published fifteen authored and edited\nbooks, and over two hundred articles, reviews and comments of other\nauthors. All of his publications, written in a crystal clear style,\nare characterized by rigorous argumentation and original thought.\nIntroductory books like Logic, Space, Time and\nMotion, and Foundations of Scientific Inference are\nmasterpieces which have served as reference books for generations of\nstudents and researchers operating in various fields, while\nStatistical Explanation and Statistical Relevance,\nScientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World,\nExplanation and Causality, and Reality and\nRationality are unparalleled sources of inspiration for\nphilosophers of science working on explanation, causality, and\nscientific rationality. An ardent admirer of Italian culture, in the\n1990s Salmon enjoyed a fruitful cooperation with Dennis Looney, at the\ntime a professor of Italian at the University of Pittsburgh. They\ntaught a few courses focused on the intersections between the Italian\ncultural tradition and the history of science, considering among\nothers Dante, Leonardo, Galileo, Leopardi, Galvani, Fermi, Calvino,\nand Primo Levi. At the time of his sudden death Salmon was working on\na book, co-authored by Looney, a draft of which, bearing the title\n\u201cItalian Science and Letters: Draft\u201d, is accessible as\npart of the Wesley C. Salmon Papers collection, Archives of\nScientific Philosophy (Doc. 31735033465448, Box 26, Folder 1\n \u2013 see Other Internet Resources).\n",
