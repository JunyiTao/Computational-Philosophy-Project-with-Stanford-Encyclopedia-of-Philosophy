    "main_text": "Alternative accounts || Learning theory\n8.1 Learning theory\n\nIn belief revision theory, the focus is on consistency rather than\ntruthfulness. In contrast, learning theory is devoted to induction and\nthe attainment of true beliefs. A research question is represented as\na partition of the set of possible worlds, i.e. a distribution of all\npossible worlds into non-overlapping sets. The research question has\nbeen fully answered when it is known which of these partitions\ncontains the actual world. Information received by the agent\nsuccessively narrows down the set of partitions that may contain it.\nThe central issue is how to construct an inductive strategy, i.e. a\nstrategy for which investigations to perform and in what order, and\nhow to interpret them (Kelly 1999). Although this problem has\nconnections with belief revision, operations not satisfying the\nstandard AGM postulates have usually played a prominent role in the\ndiscussion. (Genin and Kelly 2019)\n",
