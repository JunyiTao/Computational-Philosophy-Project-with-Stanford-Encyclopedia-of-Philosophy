    "main_text": "Donor Matching and Selection || Selection against Disability and Disadvantage\n3.2 Selection against Disability and Disadvantage\n\nThe desire to have a child free from disability and disease is often\nconsidered the least contentious ground for gamete donor selection.\nParents and prospective parents, after-all, tend to want the best for\ntheir children and diseases and disabilities can make the attainment\nof a \u2018good life\u2019 harder. Given this, and the fact\nthat donor selection, unlike other forms of selective reproduction,\nraises few thorny questions regarding women\u2019s rights over their\nown bodies and the moral permissibility of abortion or the destruction\nof embryos, the dominant position among philosophers regarding gamete\nselection for the purpose of disability avoidance is one of\npermissiveness (see for example: Robertson 1994; Glover et al.\n1989; Glover 2006; Strong 1997; Bennett 2001; Wilkinson 2010).\nRobertson (1994) sums up this view well when he states:\n\n\nThe desire not to have a child with serious defects is not itself\nimmoral, and actions to avoid such a reproductive outcome should be\nrespected as an important aspect of procreative liberty. The question\nthen is what means to achieve that goal are acceptable \u2026\nPreconception selection by voluntary selection of mates or gametes\nraises the fewest problems \u2026 Concern with the genetic fitness of\na mate may not be romantic but it is rational if one is concerned\nabout the health of spouse and offspring. Mate selection should thus\nbe left to the individual. Similarly, the selection of a gamete donor\nshould be left to the couple that needs this service. (Roberson 1994:\n154)\n\n\nSome go further, arguing that donor selection for the purpose of\ndisability-avoidance is not merely permissible but, in certain\ncircumstances, obligatory (see, for example: Savulescu 2001; Savulescu\n& Kahane 2009; Harris 1985, 2002; Buchanan et al 2000; Glover\n1989; Glover 2006). Discussions regarding this matter have tended to\nfocus less on gamete donor selection and more on the selection of\nembryos and fetuses through pre-implantation and pre-natal genetic\ndiagnosis. However, as Holm and Bennett (2014) and Williams (2017)\nnote, arguments suggesting a moral obligation to select against\ndisability in these contexts apply to gamete donor selection too.\n\nIndeed, that this is the case can be seen clearly in the negative\nmedia reaction and public outrage directed towards a deaf couple who,\nafter deliberately conceiving a deaf child in the early 2000s via the\nuse of a 5th generation deaf sperm donor, were vilified by\nthe tabloid media and condemned by the US National Association of the\nDeaf. (For interesting and insightful commentaries on this case see\nSavulescu 2002; Spriggs 2002; Fahmy 2011.) It can also be seen in the\nfact that many countries require that clinics screen out\npotential donors for heritable diseases prior to their inclusion on\nthe donor register. A notable example of this is the UK\u2019s Human\nFertilisation and Embryology Act which, since 2008, has included a\nclause prohibiting the selection of gamete donors and embryos\n\n\nthat are known to have a gene, chromosome, or mitochondrion\nabnormality involving a significant risk that a person with the\nabnormality will have or develop: (a) a serious physical or mental\ndisability, (b) a serious illness, or (c) another serious medical\ncondition. (HFE Act 2008, s. 14(4)(9) \u2013 see Other Internet\nResources)\n\n\nYet on what grounds might such an obligation be based? Some suggest\nthat a moral basis for such an obligation may be found by focusing\non the interests of and/or the rights of the children that will result\nfrom our procreative decisions (see Davis 2001 for a\nrights-focused approach). Arguments falling into this category thus\nfocus on person-affecting reasons, picking out the harms or limits to\nopportunity associated with certain disabilities as providing good\nreason to select against donors with traits liable to result in such\nharms and limits to opportunity. Such an approach is intuitive.\nHowever, given the conclusions of the Non-Identity Problem (see the entry\non\n the non-identity problem),\n many question the logic of appeals to the interests of the child\ncreated in all but cases of the most severe disabilities. For, as it\nis generally held that a life with a disease or disability is better\nthan no life at all, and selection decisions alter who it is that\ncomes to exist rather than the prospects of determinate future\npersons, a focus on the interests of future children cannot ground\nsuch an obligation (Bennett 2009; Parfit 1984; Parker 2007; Robertson\n1994).\n\nOthers suggest that although the objects of our procreative efforts\nmay not be harmed by being born with a disability, prospective parents\nmay nevertheless have good moral reason to select against disability\nin their offspring on the basis of other considerations. These include\nappeals to the interests of others whose interests may be affected by\nour reproductive decisions such as existing children and other\ndependents (Roberts 2009) and taxpayers in countries with socialized\nmedical and welfare systems (Heyd 1995; Fahmy 2011; Rakowski 2002;\nWilliams 2017); appeals to the claim that to fail to take reasonable\nsteps to prevent disability in one\u2019s future children is contrary\nto common conceptions of the good parent (Steinbock & McClamrock\n1994); and to the suggestion that that those who fail to avoid\ndisability in their offspring act wrongly as they deliberately or\nnegligently choose to create a state of affairs that is strictly worse\n(in terms of some particular value such as happiness/preference\nsatisfaction) than the state of affairs that could have been created\nhad they chosen differently (Harris 1985; Parfit 1984; Glover 1989;\nGlover 2006). (See the entry on\n eugenics\n for a more detailed treatment and criticisms of different arguments\nin support of an obligation to select against disability.)\n\nSuch arguments have, however, been criticized on a number of grounds.\nSome suggest that parental obligations to their offspring cannot be so\nstrong as to ground an obligation to select against disability\n(Williams 2017); others claim that \u201ccomplex concepts such as the good\nlife, the best life, and human flourishing, are not reducible to\nsimple elements or constituent parts which might be identified by the\ntesting of embryos [and selection of sperm donors]\u201d (Parker 2007:\n281); and others still question the link between disability and low\nlevels of welfare (Barker & Wilson, 2019) and/or claim that\nappealing to impersonal harms devalues those with disabilities by\nsuggesting that their lives are worth less than those without\ndisabilities (Asch 2003; Bennett 2009). Yet, while many authors\nsuggest that there cannot be an obligation to select against\ndisability, it is often held that prospective parents should still be\nat liberty to select against disability in their offspring on the\nbasis of personal preferences.\n\nAmong a number of authors associated with the disability rights\nmovement however, a different claim is made. For, such authors suggest\nthat not only can there be no moral obligation to select against\ndisability, parental preferences to screen out disabled donors are\nmorally problematic for two reasons. The first regards the messages\nthat such preferences send about and towards persons living with\ndisabilities, ones which may be seen as discriminatory and offensive:\n\u201cexpress[ing] a hurtful attitude about and a hurtful message to\npeople who live with [disabilities]\u201d (Parens & Asch 1999:\nS2). The second is that the desire to select against disabling genetic\ntraits is based on misinformation regarding both the severity and true\nnature of disability. In terms of severity, for example, it has been\nwidely reported that persons with disabilities tend to report good\nquality of life despite the fact that most (non-disabled) observers\nsuggest the opposite (for work on the disability paradox see Albrecht\n& Devlieger 1999). Regarding the true nature of disability, it is\nclaimed that contrary to the views of many, who hold that disability\nis inherently disadvantageous, many (and, for those who take an\nextreme approach, all) of the harms associated with disability are\nsocially constructed. That is, they are often not the result of\nfailures in functioning but society\u2019s failing to account for\neveryone when designing physical, economic, and social institutions\n(Glackin 2010). Thus, it is suggested that as disability is often not\na feature intrinsic to those who suffer it, to attempt to prevent\ndisability by preventing the existence of persons with disabilities is\nvery much akin to attempts to prevent sexism or racism by preventing\nthe births of black people and women: an inappropriate response to a\nsocial problem (Asch 2003).\n\nTaken to extremes, however, social constructivism is often viewed as\nirredeemably flawed by the academic community and a great number of\nable bodied and disabled persons alike. Robert Kitcher expresses this\nwell when he notes that if we take a wholly social constructivist\nview\n\n\nattempts to decrease the incidence of Tay-Sachs will be no different\nfrom Northern Indian sex selection or from anticipated future efforts\nto cure lesbians. (Kitcher 1996: 215)\n\n\n(See the entries on\n parenthood and procreation\n &\n eugenics\n for more in depth discussion of the suggestion that there may be a\nmoral obligation to select against disability in our offspring and the\nentry\n disability: definitions, models, experience\n for more information on models of disability.)\n",
