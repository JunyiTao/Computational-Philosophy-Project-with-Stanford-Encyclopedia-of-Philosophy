Biographical Sketch of McTaggart\n\n\nJohn McTaggart Ellis McTaggart was born on the third of September,\n1866, in Norfolk Square in London, to Francis Ellis and Susan\nMcTaggart (Rochelle 1991, 16). He was named at birth \u201cJohn\nMcTaggart Ellis\u201d, but took on the second iteration of\n\u201cMcTaggart\u201d after his great-uncle, also named \u201cJohn\nMcTaggart\u201d, died without descendents and willed his money to\nFrancis Ellis on the condition that his family assumed the surname\n\u201cMcTaggart\u201d. And so John McTaggart Ellis became John\nMcTaggart Ellis McTaggart. (At Cambridge, he was sometimes referred to\nas \u201cMcT\u201d.)\n\nHe began preparatory school at Weybridge, but because of his frequent\nadvocacy of atheism he was removed, and transplanted to Caterham.\nThere he became notorious for refusing to play football, preferring\nrather to lie in the middle of the field (Levy 1981, 101).\nHe began to study Immanuel Kant\u2019s\nCritique of Pure Reason around this\n time (Rochelle 1991, 20).\nHe moved from Caterham to Clifton College as a boarding student in 1882. He\n cherished his memories of Clifton College, despite the perhaps not\n infrequent bullying he encountered\n there.[3]\n\n\nHe began his study of philosophy at Trinity College in Cambridge in\n1885 (Rochelle 1991, 42).  In 1886 he joined the influential secret\ndiscussion group, the Cambridge Apostles (Rochelle 1991, 45; Levy\n1981, 103).  At this time, A.N. Whitehead was already a member of the\ngroup, and G.  E. Moore and Bertrand Russell would soon join in the\nearly 1890s.  McTaggart graduated in 1888 (Rochelle 1991, 57).  He was\nelected a Prize Fellow of Trinity College in 1891 on the basis of his\ndissertation on Hegel\u2019s dialectic, which was later recast as\nhis Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic. In 1897 he was made a\nlecturer in Moral Sciences (Philosophy) at Trinity College, and he\nheld this post until he retired in 1923 at the age of 56 (Geach 1979,\n14). He died unexpectedly two years later, in 1925.\n\n\nInspired by the work of F.H. Bradley, he published a pamphlet\n\u201cThe Further Determination of the Absolute\u201d in 1893. (This\npamphlet is reprinted in his Philosophical Studies.) There he\nargued that there are three stages to demonstrating the\n\u201cidealist\u2019s philosophy\u201d. First, prove that the world\nis not exclusively matter, next prove that it is exclusively spiritual,\nand finally determine the nature of spirituality. He argues that it\nfollows from Hegel\u2019s dialectic that the universe is timeless, and\nthat both knowledge and desire are mere appearance. The true reality\nthat gives rise to these appearances consists in finite spirits\nperceiving and loving one another. The production of \u201cThe Further\nDetermination of the Absolute\u201d was an emotional experience as\nwell for McTaggart. He wrote in a letter that \u201cIt was like\nturning one\u2019s heart inside\n out\u201d (Dickinson 1931, 37).\n\n\nThroughout his life, he defended the claim that ultimate reality\nconsists of loving spirits. He did not live to see his final defense in\nprint. He died in 1925, at the age of 58, two years before the second\nvolume of the Nature of Existence was published in 1927 under\nthe editorial care of C.D. Broad.\n\nF.H. Bradley was an important influence on McTaggart. McTaggart thought\nthat Bradley was \u201cthe greatest of living philosophers\u201d and\nonce told G.E. Moore that when Bradley walked in, \u201che felt as if\na Platonic Idea had entered the\n room\u201d.[4]\nMcTaggart also greatly admired\nSpinoza, enough to have a quotation from Spinoza engraved on his\ntombstone. But McTaggart\u2019s philosophical views were distinctively\nhis own.\n\nIn turn, McTaggart was influential in the intellectual development of\nG.E. Moore. McTaggart was Moore\u2019s youngest philosophy teacher at\nCambridge. According to Paul Levy what influenced Moore most was\nMcTaggart\u2019s \u201cconstant insistence on clearness, on asking\nthe question \u2018what does this mean\u2019\u201d (Levy 1981, 60).\nMoore read and commented on early drafts of both\nMcTaggart\u2019s Some Dogmas of Religion, published first in\n1906, and the first volume of the Nature of\n Existence.[5]\n\n\n\nBertrand Russell, whose early work was deeply influenced by McTaggart,\nclaims that McTaggart was very shy. In his autobiography, Russell\nwrites:\n\n\n\u2026 McTaggart was even shyer than I was. I heard a knock on my\ndoor one day\u2026 a very gentle knock. I said \u201ccome in\u201d\nbut nothing happened. I said \u201ccome in\u201d louder. The door\nopened, and I saw McTaggart on the mat. He was already a president of\nthe union, and about to become a fellow, and I was inspired and in awe\non account of his metaphysical reputation, but he was too shy to come\nin, and I was too shy to ask him in. I cannot remember how many\nminutes this situation lasted, but somehow or other he was at last in\nthe room. (Russell 1951, 88)\n\n\nRussell also tells us later in his autobiography that he wondered if\nhe would ever do as good as work as McTaggart (Russell 1951, 200).\n\nC.D. Broad described McTaggart, who was his director of studies\nat\n Cambridge (Redpath 1997, 571),\nthusly:\n\n\nTake an eighteenth-century English Whig. Let him be a mystic. Endow\nhim with the logical subtlety of the great schoolmen and their belief\nin the powers of human reason, with the business capacities of a\nsuccessful lawyer, and with the lucidity of the best type of French\nmathematician. Inspire him (Heaven knows how) in early youth with a\npassion for Hegel. Then subject him to the teaching of Sidgwick and the\ncontinual influence of Moore and Russell. Set him to expound Hegel.\nWhat will be the result? Hegel himself could not have answered\nthis question a priori, but the course of the world history\nhas solved it ambulando by producing McTaggart. (C.D. Broad,\n1927, pp.312-313, quoted in Keeling 1929.)\n\nHe was on most accounts an unusual fellow, with a big head and a\ncrab-like\n walk (Rochelle 1991, 97).\nPeter Geach (1971, 10) reports that,\n\u201cTo the end of his days he walked down corridors with a curious\nshuffle, back to the wall, as if expecting a sudden kick from\nbehind.\u201d Unlike F.H. Bradley, whose feline-directed nocturnal\nactivities were not so benign, McTaggart saluted cats whenever he\nmet\n them (Dickinson 1931, 68; Rochelle 1991, 97). \n(F.H.\nBradley preferred to shoot cats; see the entry on \n F. H. Bradley.) His preferred\nmethod of transportation was a tricycle, a fact which led a Cambridge\npaper to publish the following poem about him:\n\nPhilosopher, your head is all askew; your gait is not majestic in the\nleast; you ride three wheels, where other men ride two;\nPhilosopher, you are a funny beast.\n\n\nMcTaggart was delighted by this\n poem.[6]\n",
