    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Existence, Reality, and Causation\n2.1 Existence, Reality, and Causation\n\nThroughout his commentaries \u015aa\u1e45kara employs two related\ncriteria, dependence and persistence, to determine what is real. He\ndefines the real as that which does not change its nature, whereas\nwhat is unreal does change (see, e.g., GKBh 2.6; TaiUBh 2.1.1). The\nprimary distinction here is change. Something which persists is more\nreal than what is transient because what is transient is subject to\nnegation. His canonical illustration is a clay pot. One may shape a\nsubstantial cause such as clay into new names and forms, from a lump\nto a pot to a plate. With each new form, the former is destroyed, yet\nthe clay continues through each. This example illustrates his\nfoundational discriminative reasoning of continuity and discontinuity,\nwhich determines the relationship of what persists and what does not\npersist between two things (see\n \u00a74.3\n below). Accordingly, the clay persisting through causation is\nrelatively more real than the non-persisting lump, pot, and plate\nforms, because clay is not negatable. In this illustration, clay is\nanalogous to brahman, the underlying existence of the\nuniverse, and the pot is analogous to objects.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara also incorporates the persistence argument to show\nthat one term (clay) is independent of another (pot)\u2014clay is\nmore real based on independence in causation. The pot form arises out\nof the clay cause, is sustained by clay, and resolves back into clay\nupon its destruction. The pot depends on clay for its being. Its form\nand mass possess no objective existence apart from its clay substance.\nTherefore, the clay is more real based on a hierarchy of dependency.\nThis hierarchical relationship reveals an asymmetrical\ndependence\u2014pot form depends upon clay substance for its being,\nbut clay substance does not depend on the particular pot form.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara draws several important conclusions from this:\n\nthe metaphysical ground possesses more reality than the grounded\neffect;\nthe effect is wholly reducible to its causal ground; and\ntherefore the effect is not different than its ground.\n\n\n(See ChUBh ch. 6 and BrS\u016bBh 2.1.15\u201320 for\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s understanding of cause and effect; see\nPotter 1981: 65\u20137 for a summary of his views on causality).\n\nEverything in the universe undergoes constant change; however,\naccording to \u015aa\u1e45kara, objects cannot simply come into being\nand go out of being. They must depend on something else, some existent\ncause, for their being. \u015aa\u1e45kara argues that prior to\nuniverse emergence, when all objects, time, and space, are unmanifest,\nonly primordial undifferentiated existence exists (see ChUBh\n6.2.1\u20132 for example). This existence is a single potential cause\nfree of form; but even after the universe emerges, there is still just\nthat single cause. It persists through all objects and causation, like\nthe clay persists through its changing forms. He concludes that every\nobject, including the universe itself, is a temporal artifact, simply\na name (n\u0101ma) and form (r\u016bpa). The entire\nuniverse is not different from brahman, and its form is less\nreal than brahman. All forms are less real than existence\nitself. Foundational existence is transitive, lending existence to\nobjects, like the clay to each of its forms. Furthermore, the\nrelationship is asymmetrical\u2014pure undifferentiated existence\ndoes not depend on objects, but objects depend on existence. Objects\nborrow their existence from this metaphysical ground and lack any\nindependent being apart from it. They are not different than their\ncause, and therefore their names and forms are only provisionally real\nappearances.\n\nIn considering \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s position, it is questionable\nwhere to locate the given existence possessed by objects in everyday\npropositions like, \u201cthis pot exists\u201d, \u201cthis seed\nis\u201d, or \u201cthe shirt is\u201d. How would one isolate the\nobject\u2019s existence within its particular form? For\n\u015aa\u1e45kara, this question is misguided and unanswerable\nbecause form does not delimit existence. When one encounters a form\nand seeks its existence in the locus of its substantial cause, one\nencounters another form that decomposes into further forms. For\nexample, the existence of a shirt depends on its causal cloth\nsubstance; however, cloth existence depends on threads, thread\nexistence depends on fibers, and fibers are composed of further subtle\ncauses, ad infinitum. Similarly, we may view the pot beyond\nthe boundaries of an illustration\u2014clay is the material cause of\nthe pot, but has further causes, like minerals and water, which\nthemselves depend on a descending chain of subtler causes.\n\nReductions of wholes to aggregates of parts, forms to further forms,\nproperties to other properties, effects to causes, or names to further\nnames are infinite. They never bottom out in a metaphysical\nfoundation. The proposition that an object\u2019s form delimits\nexistence crumbles because the regress defers an object\u2019s\nexistence to the next ontological level, an unending descent into\nsubtler causes or further mereological parts. Therefore, attempting to\nisolate stable independent existence as delimited by a given form is a\nreceding horizon. The form\u2019s existence is self-evident at each\npoint, but forever out of objective reach. \u015aa\u1e45kara argues\nthat this non-finding of existence in a form or as a form should not\nlead to positing the emergence of objects (e.g., properties, forms,\nwholes, etc.) from non-existence somewhere in the chain of dependency\n(a position he interprets as Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophy). Nor\nshould one conclude that if no unchanging ultimate essence can be\nobjectified, then everything must be empty of essential existence, and\ntherefore no metaphysical foundation ultimately exists (see ChUbh\n6.2.1\u20132). He considers this latter position, which he construes\nas the Madhyamika Buddhist, to be counter-intuitively nihilistic. It\nalso conflicts with his premises that existence is self-evident and\nthat it persists even as something evolves or devolves. Decomposition\nchains do not reveal any disruption of existence, only disruption of\nforms.\n\nThe philosophical upshot of \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s metaphysic is\nthat no form or object constitutes the fundamental ground of\nexistence. This explains why one cannot isolate existence itself\nthrough hierarchical descension or ascension in the realm of causation\nand objects. If this very effort is misguided, then the non-finding of\nexistence in an object does not entail an absolute absence of\nexistence, nor the object\u2019s emergence from non-existence. He\nrejects the presupposition that objects possess a property of\nexistence, or that the object delimits existence in spatial-temporal\nways. Existence is formless and nondual in reality. Therefore, in\nlight of \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s theory of causation, one cannot\nattribute independent reality to an object. Objects are divisible,\nderivative, dependent, and transient. They are merely names,\nnominalist wholes that lack any independent being. By negating the\nreality of their name and form one discovers that objects are in fact\nnumerically identical to formless existence. If this existence is not\nbound by space or time, which are also forms, it must be nondual. (See\n\u015aa\u1e45kara on BrS\u016b 2.1.15, ChU 6.2.2, and BhG 2.16 for\nfurther discussion of these points).\n",
