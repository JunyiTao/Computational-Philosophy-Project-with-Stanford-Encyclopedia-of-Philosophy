    "main_text": "Practical Consequences: The Artist and the Community\n8. Problems\n\nCollingwood\u2019s theory is generally lumped together with that of\nBenedetto Croce as an expressive and idealist theory. There are of\ncourse differences, but the established picture is not inaccurate. And\ntogether with Croce\u2019s theory, Collingwood\u2019s has a fatal\ndefect (without questioning the starting-point, that the essence of\nart to be expressive): In identifying the artwork with what we would\nnormally think of as the experience of the artwork, he makes nonsense\nof the idea that the spectator interprets the artwork, and\ncan do so more or less accurately; that different people can argue\nabout the self-same work of art. It has become a truism that the\nartist is no better placed than the audience to interpret a work\nrightly, a truism that Collingwood, with his fulminations again\naesthetic individualism, would agree. But then the various imaginative\nexperiences have nothing to conform to, if artwork and experience and\nhence artwork and interpretation cannot be separated. That would be\nfatal to the theory; however, it is not clear that anything\nsubstantial would be lost, if Collingwood were simply to identify the\nwork of art with the \u2018bodily work\u2019, thereby\nre-establishing room for interpretation to operate. This would seem to\nsit better with his idea that art is on a level with language, where\nlanguage is a public phenomenon.\n\nAn apparent further defect in Collingwood\u2019s case in particular\nis his account of language. It is full of admirable insights, but it\nis probably misconceived from back to front. The insistence that\nlanguage is always expressive is dogmatic, and leads Collingwood to\ndeny that there is any categorical distinction between poetry and\nscientific writing, which many may take as a reductio ad\nabsurdum (298). And more seriously so far as his philosophy of\nart is concerned, one might wonder about his account of consciousness\nas tied to language. According to it\u2014the theory of\nimagination\u2014merely to attend to something is thereby to\nexpress it, and furthermore is to do something\nlinguistic. Even if we allow Collingwood his generalised\nnotion of language as appertaining to gesture and so on, surely there\nhas to be a separation between consciousness or attention and\nexpression. As C. J. Ducasse pointed out, it seems that when we look\nat a vase full of flowers, do we not create a \u201cwork of\nart\u201d unless we draw or paint it (Ducasse 1929, 52\u201354).\n\nFinally, it is hard to swallow whole Collingwood\u2019s distinction\nbetween art and craft. The consequences are too severe. For example,\nCollingwood, rigorously applying the distinction, says that insofar as\nhis activity is art in the proper sense, an artist, since he has no\nidea what he is to express until he expresses it, cannot set out to\nwrite, say, a tragedy\n (116).[2]\n There is something right in the idea that that the artist cannot\n\u2018plan and execute\u2019 an inspiration. But the distinction\nCollingwood is after is surely not so cut and dried as that. He needs\nat any rate a more selective weapon to attack his bugbear of amusement\nart.\n",
