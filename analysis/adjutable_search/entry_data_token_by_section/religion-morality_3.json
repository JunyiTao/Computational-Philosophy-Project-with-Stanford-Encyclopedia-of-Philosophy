    "main_text": "Modern Philosophy\n5. Contemporary Philosophy\n\n\nIn the twentieth century professional philosophy in the West divided\nup into two streams, sometimes called \u2018Analytic\u2019 and\n\u2018Continental\u2019, and there were periods during which the two\nschools lost contact with each other. Towards the end of the century,\nhowever, there were more philosophers who could speak the languages of\nboth traditions. The beginning of the analytic school is sometimes\nlocated with the rejection of a neo-Hegelian idealism by G.E. Moore\n(1873-1958). One way to characterize the two schools is that the\nContinental school continued to read and be influenced by Hegel, and\nthe Analytic school (with some exceptions) did not. Another way to\nmake the distinction is geographical; the analytic school is located\nprimarily in Britain, Scandinavia and N. America, and the continental\nschool in the rest of Europe, in Latin America and in certain schools\nin N. America.\n\n\nWe will start with some figures from the Continental school, and then\nmove to the analytic (which is this writer's own). Martin Heidegger\n(1889\u20131976) was initially trained as a theologian, and wrote his\ndissertation on what he took to be a work of Duns Scotus. He took an\nappointment under Edmund Husserl (1855\u20131938) at Freiburg, and\nwas then appointed to succeed him in his chair. Husserl's program of\n\u2018phenomenology\u2019 was to recover a sense of certainty about\nthe world by studying in exhaustive detail the cognitive structure of\nappearance. Heidegger departed from Husserl in approaching Being\nthrough a focus on \u2018Human Being\u2019 (in\nGerman Dasein) concerned above all for its fate in an alien\nworld, or as \u2018anxiety\u2019 (Angst) towards death\n(see Being and Time I. 6). In this sense he is the first\nexistentialist, though he did not use the term. Heidegger emphasized\nthat we are \u2018thrown\u2019 into a world that is not\n\u2018home\u2019, and we have a radical choice about what\npossibilities for ourselves we will make actual. Heidegger drew here\nfrom Kierkegaard, and he is also similar in describing the danger of\nfalling back into mere conventionality, what Heidegger calls\n\u2018the They\u2019 (das Man). On the other hand he is\nunlike Kierkegaard in thinking of traditional Christianity as just one\nmore convention making authentic existence more difficult. In\nHeidegger, as in Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, it is hard to find a\npositive or constructive ethics. Heidegger's position is somewhat\ncompromised, moreover, by his initial embrace of the Nazi party. In\nhis later work he moved increasingly towards a kind of quasi-religious\nmysticism. His Romantic hatred of the modern world and his distrust of\nsystem-building led to the espousal of either silence or poetry as the\nbest way to be open to the \u2018something\u2019 (sometimes he says\n\u2018the earth\u2019) which reveals itself only as\n\u2018self-secluding\u2019 or hiding itself away from our various\nconceptualizations. He held the hope that through poetry, and in\nparticular the poetry of H\u00f6lderlin, we might be able to still\nsense something of the unknown god who appears \u2018as the one who\nremains unknown,\u2019 who is quite different from the object of\ntheology or piety, but who can bring us back to the Being we have long\nlost sight of (Poetry, Language, Thought, 222).\n\n\nJean-Paul Sartre (1905-80) did use the label\n\u2018existentialist\u2019, and said that \u2018Existentialism is\nnothing else than an attempt to draw all the consequences of a\ncoherent atheist position\u2019 (Existentialism and Human\nEmotions, 51). He denied (like Scotus) that the moral law could\nbe deduced from human nature, but this was because (unlike Scotus) he\nthought that we give ourselves our own essences by the choices we\nmake. His slogan was, \u2018Existence precedes essence\u2019 (Ibid.,\n13). \u2018Essence\u2019 is here the defining property of a thing,\nand Sartre gave the example of a paper cutter, which is given its\ndefinition by the artisan who makes it. Sartre said that when people\nbelieved God made human beings, they could believe humans had a\nGod-given essence; but now that we do not believe this, we have\nrealized that humans give themselves their own essences (\u2018First\nof all, man exists, turns up, appears on the scene, and, only\nafterwards, defines himself.\u2019 Ibid., 15). On this view there are\nno outside commands to appeal to for legitimation, and we are\ncondemned to our own freedom. Sartre thought of human beings as trying\nto be God (on a Hegelian account of what God is), even though there is\nno God. This is an inevitably fruitless undertaking, which he called\n\u2018anguish\u2019. Moreover, we inevitably desire to choose not\njust for ourselves, but for the world. We want, like God, to create\nhumankind in our own image, \u2018If I want to marry, to have\nchildren, even if this marriage depends solely on my own circumstances\nor passion or wish, I am involving all humanity in monogamy and not\nmerely myself. Therefore, I am responsible for myself and for everyone\nelse. I am creating a certain image of man of my own choosing. In\nchoosing myself, I choose man\u2019 (Ibid., 18). To recognize that\nthis project does not make sense is required by honesty, and to hide\nthis from ourselves is \u2018bad faith\u2019. One form of bad faith\nis to pretend that there is a God who is giving us our tasks. Another\nis to pretend that there is a \u2018human nature\u2019 that is doing\nthe same thing. To live authentically is to realize both that we\ncreate these tasks for ourselves, and that they are futile.\n\n\nThe twentieth century also saw, within Roman Catholicism, forms of\nChristian Existentialism and new adaptations of the system of Thomas\nAquinas. Gabriel Marcel (1889\u20131973), like Heidegger, was\nconcerned with the nature of Being as it appears to human being, but\nhe tried to show that there are experiences of love, joy, hope and\nfaith which, as understood from within, give us reason to\nbelieve in an inexhaustible Presence, which is God. Jacques Maritain\n(1882\u20131973) developed a form of Thomism that retained the\nnatural law, but regarded ethical judgment as not purely cognitive but\nguided by pre-conceptual affective inclinations. He gave more place to\nhistory than traditional Thomism did, allowing for development in the\nhuman knowledge of natural law, and he defended democracy as the\nappropriate way for human persons to attain freedom and dignity. The\nnotion of the value of the person and the capacities given to persons\nby their creator was at the center of the \u2018personalism\u2019 of\nPope John Paul II's\nThe Acting Person (1979), influenced by Max Scheler\n(1874\u20131928).\n\n\nNatural law theory has been taken up and modified more recently by\nthree philosophers who write in a style closer to the analytic\ntradition, John Finnis, Alastair MacIntyre and Jean Porter. Finnis\nholds that our knowledge of the fundamental moral truths is\nself-evident, and so is not deduced from human nature. His Natural\nLaw and Natural Rights (1980) was a landmark in integrating the\nmodern vocabulary and grammar of rights into the tradition of Natural\nLaw. MacIntyre, who has been on a long journey back from Marxism to\nThomism, holds that we can know what kind of life we ought to live on\nthe basis of knowing our natural end, which he now identifies in\ntheological terms. In After Virtue (1981) he is still\ninfluenced by a Hegelian historicism, and holds that the only way to\nsettle rival knowledge claims is to see how successfully each can\naccount for the shape taken by its rivals. A different account of\nnatural law is found in Porter, who in Nature as Reason\n(2005) retains the view that our final motivation is our own happiness\nand perfection, but rejects the view that we can deduce absolute\naction-guiding moral principles from human nature. Another\ncontemporary school is virtue ethics, for example Philippa Foot in\nNatural Goodness (2001) and Rosalind Hursthouse in On\nVirtue Ethics (1999). They are not Roman Catholic but they are\nstrongly influenced by Aristotle and Aquinas. They emphasize the\nnotion of virtue which belongs to human nature just as bees have\nstings. Hursthouse ends her book by saying that we have to hold onto\nthe hope that we can live together, not at each other's\nexpense, a hope which she says used to be called belief in (God's)\nProvidence (On Virtue Ethics, 265). One final contribution to\nbe mentioned here is Linda Zagzebski's Divine Motivation\nTheory (2004) which proposes, as an alternative to divine command\ntheory, that we can understand all moral normatively in terms of the\nnotion of a good emotion, and that God's emotions are the best\nexemplar. We will return to the rebirth of divine command theory at\nthe end of this entry.\n\n\nMichel Foucault (1926\u201384) followed Nietzsche in aspiring to\nuncover the \u2018genealogy\u2019 of various contemporary forms of\nthought and practice (he was concerned, for example, with our\ntreatment of sexuality and mental illness), and how relations of power\nand domination have produced \u2018discourses of truth\u2019\n(\u201cTruth and Power,\u201d Power, 131). In his later\nwork he described four different aspects of the \u2018practice of the\nself\u2019: We select the desires, acts, and thoughts that we attend\nto morally, we recognize ourselves as morally bound by some particular\nground, e.g., divine commands, or rationality, or human nature, we\ntransform ourselves into ethical subjects by some set of techniques,\ne.g., meditation or mortification or consciousness-raising, and\nfinally, we propose a \u2018telos\u2019 or goal, the way of\nlife or mode of being that the subject is aiming at, e.g.,\nself-mastery, tranquility or purification. Foucault criticized\nChristian conventions that tend to take morality as a juristic and\noften universal code of laws, and to ignore the creative practice of\nself-making. Even if Christian and post-Christian moralists turn their\nattention to self-expression, he thought they tend to focus on the\nconfession of truth about oneself, a mode of expression which is\nhistorically linked to the church and the modern\npsycho-sciences. Foucault preferred stressing our freedom to form\nourselves as ethical subjects, and develop \u2018a new form of\nright\u2019 and a \u2018non-disciplinary form of power\u2019\n(\u201cDisciplinary Power and Subjection,\u201d\nPower, 242). He did not, however, tell us much more about\nwhat these new forms would be like.\n\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas (1929-) proposed a \u2018communicative\nethics\u2019 that develops the Kantian element in Marxism (The\nTheory of Communicative Action, Vols. I and II). By analyzing the\nstructure of communication (using speech-act theory developed in\nanalytic philosophy) he lays out a procedure that will rationally\njustify norms, though he does not claim to know what norms a society\nwill adopt by using this procedure. The two ideas behind this\nprocedure are that norms are valid if they receive the consent of all\nthe affected parties in unconstrained practical communication, and if\nthe consequences of the general observance of the norms (in terms of\nhow each person's interests are affected) are acceptable to\nall. Habermas thinks he fulfills in this way Hegel's aim of\nreconciling the individual and society, because the communication\nprocess extends individuals beyond their private perspectives in the\nprocess of reaching agreement. Religious convictions need to be left\nbehind when entering the public square, on this scheme, because they\nare not communicable in the way the procedure requires. In recent work\nhe has modified this position, by recognizing that certain religious\nforms require their adherents to speak in an explicitly religious way\nwhen advancing their prescriptions for public life, and it is\ndiscriminatory to try to prevent their doing so.\n\n\nWithin contemporary Jewish ethics mention should be made of Martin\nBuber (1878\u20131965) and Emmanuel Levinas (1906\u201395). Buber's\nform of existentialism emphasized the I-You relationship, which exists\nnot only between human beings but (out of that) between human beings\nand God. When we reject I-You relationship, we return to I-It\nrelations, governed by our impositions of our own conceptualizations\non objects. Buber said these two relations are\nexhaustive. \u2018There is no I as such but only the I of the basic\nword I-You and the I of the basic word I-It.\u2019 (I and\nThou, 54). Levinas studied under Husserl, and knew Heidegger,\nwhose work he first embraced and then rejected. His focus, like\nBuber's, was on the \u2018ethics of the Other\u2019, and he held\nthat the face of the Other makes a demand on us even before we\nrecognize our freedom to accept it or reject it. To meet the Other is\nto have the idea of Infinity (Ethics and Infinity,\n90\u20131).\n\n\nWe are sometimes said to live now in a \u2018post-modern\u2019\nage. This term is problematic in various ways. As used within\narchitectural theory in the 1960's and 1970's it had a relatively\nclear sense. There was a recognizable style that either borrowed bits\nand pieces from styles of the past, or mocked the very idea (in\nmodernist architecture) of essential functionality. In philosophy, the\nterm is less clearly definable. It combines a distaste for\n\u2018meta-narratives\u2019 and a rejection of any form of\nfoundationalism. The effect on philosophical thinking about the\nrelation between morality and religion is two-fold. On the one hand,\nthe modernist rejection of religion on the basis of a foundationalist\nempiricism is itself rejected. This makes the current climate more\nhospitable to religious language than it was for most of the twentieth\ncentury. But on the other hand, the distaste for over-arching theory\nmeans that religious meta-narratives are suspect to the same degree as\nany other, and the hospitality is more likely to be towards bits and\npieces of traditional theology than to any theological system as a\nwhole. Habermas uses the term \u2018post-secular age\u2019 to\ndescribe our current condition, in which the secularization hypothesis\n(that religion was destined to wither away under the impact of science\nand education) has apparently failed.\n\n\nMention should be made of some movements that are not philosophical in\na professional sense, but are important in understanding the relation\nbetween morality and religion. Liberation theology, of which a leading\nspokesman from Latin America is Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez (1928-), has\nattempted to reconcile the Christian gospel with a commitment\n(influenced by Marxist categories) to revolution to relieve the\ncondition of the oppressed. The civil rights movement (drawing heavily\non Exodus), feminist ethics, animal liberation, environmental\nethics, and the gay rights and children's rights movements have shown\nspecial sensitivity to the moral status of some particular oppressed\nclass. The leadership of some of these movements has been religiously\ncommitted, while the leadership of others has not. At the same time,\nthe notion of human rights, or justified claims by every\nhuman being, has grown in global reach, partly through the various\ninstrumentalities of the United Nations. There has, however, been less\nconsensus on the question of how to justify human\nrights. There are theological justifications, deriving from the image\nof God in every human being, or the command to love the neighbor, or\nthe covenant between God and humanity (see Wolterstorff,\nJustice: Rights and Wrongs, chapter 16). Whether\nthere is a non-theological justification is not yet clear. Finally,\nthere has also been a burst of activity in professional ethics, such\nas medical ethics, engineering ethics, and business ethics. This has\nnot been associated with any one school of philosophy rather than\nanother. The connection of religion with these developments has been\nvariable. In some cases (e.g., medical ethics) the initial impetus for\nthe new sub-discipline was strongly influenced by theology, and in\nother cases not.\n\n\nThe origin of analytic philosophy can be associated with\nG.E. Moore. His Principia Ethica (1903) can be regarded as\nthe first major ethical document of the school. He was strongly\ninfluenced by Sidgwick at Cambridge, but rejected Sidgwick's negative\nviews about intuitionism. He thought that intrinsic goodness was a\nreal property of things, even though (like the number two) it does not\nexist in time and is not the object of sense experience. He explicitly\naligned himself here with Plato and against the class of empiricist\nphilosophers, \u2018to which most Englishmen have belonged\u2019\n(Principia Ethica, 162). His predecessors, Moore thought, had\nalmost all committed the error, which he called \u2018the\nnaturalistic fallacy,\u2019 of trying to define this value property\nby identifying it with a non-evaluative property. For example, they\nproposed that goodness is pleasure, or what produces pleasure. But\nwhatever non-evaluative property we try to say goodness is identical\nto, we will find that it remains an open question whether that\nproperty is in fact good. For example, it makes sense to ask whether\npleasure or the production of pleasure is good. This is true also if\nwe propose a supernatural property to identify with goodness, for\nexample the property of being commanded by God. It still makes sense\nto ask whether what God commands is good. This question cannot be the\nsame as the question \u2018Is what God commands what God\ncommands?\u2019 which is not still an open question. Moore thought\nthat if these questions are different, then the two properties,\ngoodness and being commanded by God, cannot be the same, and to say\n(by way of a definition) that they are the same is to commit the\nfallacy. Intrinsic goodness, Moore said, is a simple non-natural\nproperty (i.e., neither natural nor supernatural) and indefinable. He\nthought we had a special form of cognition that he called\n\u2018intuition,\u2019 which gives us access to such properties. By\nthis he meant that the access was not based on inference or argument,\nbut was self-evident (though we could still get it wrong, just as we\ncan with sense-perception). He thought the way to determine what\nthings had positive value intrinsically was to consider what things\nwere such that, if they existed by themselves in isolation,\nwe would yet judge their existence to be good.\n\n\nAt Cambridge Moore was a colleague of Bertrand Russell\n(1872\u20131970) and Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951). Russell\nwas not primarily a moral philosopher, but he expressed radically\ndifferent views at different times about ethics. In 1910 he agreed\nwith Moore that goodness (like roundness) is a quality that belongs to\nobjects independently of our opinions, and that when two people differ\nabout whether a thing is good, only one of them can be right. By 1922\nhe was holding an error theory (like that of John Mackie,\n1917\u201381) that although we mean by \u2018good\u2019 an\nobjective property in this way, there is in fact no such thing, and\nhence all our value judgments are strictly speaking false (\u201cThe\nElement of Ethics,\u201d Philosophical Essays). Then by 1935\nhe had dropped also the claim about meaning, holding that value\njudgments are expressions of desire or wish, and not assertions at\nall. Wittgenstein's views on ethics are enigmatic and subject to\nwildly different interpretations. In the Tractatus (which is\nabout logic) he says at the end, \u2018It is clear that ethics cannot\nbe put into words. Ethics is transcendental. (Ethics and aesthetics\nare one and the same.)\u2019 (Tractatus, 6.421). Perhaps he\nmeans that the world we occupy is good or bad (and happy or unhappy)\nas a whole, and not piece-by-piece. Wittgenstein (like Nietzsche) was\nstrongly influenced by Schopenhauer's notion of will, and by his\ndisdain for ethical theories that purport to be able to tell one what\nto do and what not to do. The Tractatus was taken up by the\nLogical Positivists, though Wittgenstein himself was never a Logical\nPositivist. The Logical Positivists held a\n\u2018verificationist\u2019 theory of meaning, that assertions can\nbe meaningful only if they can in principle be verified by sense\nexperience or if they are tautologies (for example, \u2018All\nbachelors are unmarried men.\u2019) This seems to leave ethical\nstatements (and statements about God) meaningless, and indeed that was\nthe deliberately provocative position taken by A.J. Ayer\n(1910\u201389). Ayer accepted Moore's arguments about the\nnaturalistic fallacy, and since Moore's talk of \u2018non-natural\nproperties\u2019 seemed to Ayer just nonsense, he was led to\nemphasize and analyze further the non-cognitive ingredient in\nevaluation which Moore had identified. Suppose I say to a cannibal,\n\u2018You acted wrongly in eating your prisoner.\u2019 Ayer thought\nI am not stating anything more than if I had simply said,\n\u2018You ate your prisoner.\u2019 I am, rather, evincing my moral\ndisapproval of it. It is as if I had said, \u2018You ate your\nprisoner\u2019 in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the\naddition of some special exclamation marks (Language, Truth and\nLogic, 107\u20138).\n\n\nThe emotivist theory of ethics had its most articulate treatment in\nEthics and Language by Charles Stevenson (1908\u201379). Stevenson\nwas a positivist, but also the heir of John Dewey (1859\u20131952) and the\nAmerican pragmatist tradition. Dewey had rejected the idea of fixed\nends for human beings, and stressed that moral deliberation occurs in\nthe context of competition within a person between different ends,\nnone of which can be assumed permanent. He criticized theories that\ntried to derive moral principles from self-certifying reason, or\nintuition, or cosmic forms, or divine commands, both because he\nthought there are no self-certifying faculties or self-evident norms,\nand because the alleged derivation disguises the actual function of\nthe principles as devices for social action. Stevenson applied this\nemphasis to the competition between people with different\nends, and stressed the role of moral language as a social instrument\nfor persuasion (Ethics and Language, Ch. 5). On his account,\nnormative judgments express attitudes and invite others to share these\nattitudes, but they are not strictly speaking true or false.\n\n\nWittgenstein did not publish any book after the Tractatus,\nbut he wrote and taught; and after his death Philosophical\nInvestigations was published in 1953. The later thought of\nWittgenstein bears a similar relation to the Tractatus as\nHeidegger bears to Husserl. In both cases the quest for a kind of\nscientific certainty was replaced by the recognition that science is\nitself just one language, and not in many cases prior by right. The\nlater Wittgenstein employed the notion of different \u2018forms of\nlife\u2019 in which different \u2018language games\u2019 including\nthose of religion are at home (Philosophical Investigation,\n\u00a77, 19, 373). In Oxford there was a parallel though distinct\ndevelopment centering round the work of John Austin\n(1911\u201360). Austin did not suppose that ordinary language was\ninfallible, but he did think that it preserved a great deal of wisdom\nthat had passed the test of centuries of experience, and that\ntraditional philosophical discussion had ignored this primary\nmaterial. In How to do Things with Words (published\nposthumously) Austin labeled \u2018the descriptive fallacy\u2019 the\nmistake of thinking that all language is used to perform the act of\ndescribing or reporting, and he attributed the discovery of this\nfallacy to Kant (How to do Things with Words, 3).\n\n\nR.M. Hare (1919\u20132002) took up the diagnosis of this fallacy, and\nproposed a \u2018universal prescriptivism\u2019 which attributed\nthree characteristics to the language of morality. First, it is\nprescriptive, which is to say that moral judgments express the will in\na way analogous to commands. This preserves the emotivist insight that\nmoral judgment is different from assertion, but does not deny the role\nof rationality in such judgment. Second, moral judgment is\nuniversalizable. This is similar to the formula of Kant's categorical\nimperative that requires that we be able to will the maxims of our\nactions as universal laws. Third, moral judgment is overriding. This\nmeans that moral prescriptions legitimately take precedence over any\nother normative prescriptions. In Moral Thinking (1981) Hare\nclaimed to demonstrate that utilitarianism followed from these three\nfeatures of morality, though he excluded ideals (in the sense of\npreferences for how the world should be independently of the agent's\nconcurrent desires or experience) from the scope of this argument. God\nenters in two ways into this picture. First, Hare proposed a figure he\ncalls \u2018the archangel\u2019 who is the model for fully critical\n(as opposed to intuitive) moral thinking, having full access to all\nthe relevant information and complete impartiality between the\naffected parties. Hare acknowledge that since archangels (e.g.,\nLucifer) are not reliably impartial in this way, it is really God who\nis the model. Second, we have to be able to believe (as Kant argued)\nthat the universe sustains morality in the sense that it is worthwhile\ntrying to be morally good. Hare thought that this requires something\nlike a belief (he called it a \u2018blik\u2019) in the operation of\nProvidence (\u201cThe Simple Believer,\u201d Essays on Religion\nand Education, appendix, 37\u20139).\n\n\nThe most important opponent of utilitarianism in the twentieth century\nwas John Rawls (1921\u20132005). In his Theory of Justice\n(1971) he gave, like Hare, an account of ethics heavily indebted to\nKant. But he insisted that utilitarianism does not capture the Kantian\ninsight that each person is an end in himself or herself, because it\n\u2018does not take seriously the distinction between persons\u2019\n(Theory of Justice, 22). He constructed the thought\nexperiment of the \u2018Original Position\u2019 in which individuals\nimagine themselves not knowing what role in society they are going to\nplay or what endowments of talent or material wealth they possess, and\nagree together on what principles of justice they will accept. Rawls\nthought it important that substantive conceptions of the good life\nwere left behind in moving to the Original Position, because he was\nattempting to provide an account of justice that people with competing\nvisions of the good could agree to in a pluralist society. Like early\nHabermas he included religions under this\nprohibition. In Political Liberalism (1993) he conceded that\nthe procedure of the Original Position is itself ideologically\nconstrained, and he moved to the idea of an overlapping consensus:\nKantians can accept the idea of justice as fairness (which the\nprocedure describes) because it realizes autonomy, utilitarians\nbecause it promotes overall utility, Christians because it is part of\ndivine law, etc. But even here Rawls wanted to insist that adherents\nof the competing visions of the good leave their particular\nconceptions behind in public discourse and justify the\npolicies they endorse on grounds that are publicly accessible. He\ndescribed this as the citizen's duty of civility (Political\nLiberalism, iv).\n\n\nThe section of this entry on the continental school discussed briefly\nthe topic of postmodernism. Within analytic philosophy the term is\nless prevalent. But both schools live in the same increasingly global\ncultural context. In this context we can reflect on the two main\ndisqualifiers of the project of relating morality intimately to\nreligion that seemed to emerge in the nineteenth and twentieth\ncenturies. The first disqualifier was the prestige of natural science,\nand the attempt to make it foundational for all human knowledge. The\nvarious empiricist, verificationist, and reductionist forms of\nfoundationalism have not yet succeeded, and even within modern\nphilosophy there has been a continuous resistance to them. This is not\nto say they will not succeed in the future (for example we may\ndiscover a foundation for ethics in the theory of evolution), but the\nconfidence in their future success has waned. Moreover, the\nsecularization hypothesis seems to have been false, as mentioned\nearlier. Certainly parts of Western Europe are less attached to\ntraditional institutional forms of religion. But taking the world as a\nwhole, religion seems to be increasing in influence rather than\ndeclining as the world's educational standards improve. The second\nmain disqualifier was the liberal idea (present in the narrative of\nthis entry from the time of the religious wars in Europe) that we need\na moral discourse based on reason and not religion in order to avoid\nthe hatred and bloodshed that religion seems to bring with it. Here\nthe response to Rawls has been telling. It seems false that we can\nrespect persons and at the same time tell them to leave their\nfundamental commitments behind in public discourse, and it seems false\nalso that some purely rational but still action-guiding component can\nbe separated off from these competing substantive conceptions of the\ngood (see Wolterstorff, \u201cAn Engagement with Rorty\u201d.) It is\ntrue that religious commitment can produce the deliberate targeting of\ncivilians in a skyscraper. But the history of the twentieth century\nsuggests that non-religious totalitarian regimes have at least as much\nblood on their hands. Perhaps the truth is, as Kant saw, that people\nunder the Evil Maxim will use any available ideology for their\npurposes. Progress towards civility is more likely if Muslims,\nChristians, Jews, (and Buddhists and Hindus) are encouraged to enter\n\u2018the public square\u2019 with their commitments\nexplicit, and see how much common ethical ground there in fact\nis. This writer has done some of this discussion, and found the common\nground surprisingly extensive, though sometime common language\ndisguises significant differences. Progress seems more likely in this\nway than by trying to construct a neutral philosophical ground that\nvery few people actually accept.\n\n\nOne recent development in analytic ethical theory has been a revival\nof divine command theory parallel to the revival of natural law theory\nthat I have already described. A pioneer in this revival was Philip\nQuinn's Divine Command and Moral Requirements (1978). He\ndefended the theory against the usual objections (one, deriving from\nPlato's Euthyprho, that it makes morality arbitrary, and the\nsecond, deriving from a misunderstanding of Kant, that it is\ninconsistent with human autonomy), and proposed that we understand the\nrelation between God and moral rightness causally, rather than\nanalyzing the terms of moral obligation as meaning\n\u2018commanded by God\u2019. Though we could stipulate such a\ndefinition, it would make it obscure how theists and non-theists could\nhave genuine moral discussion, as they certainly seem to do. Robert\nM. Adams, in a series of articles and then in Finite and Infinite\nGoods (1999), first separates off the good (which he analyzes\nPlatonically in terms of imitating the ultimate good, which is God)\nand the right. He then defends a divine command theory of the right by\narguing that obligation is always obligation to someone, and\nGod is the most appropriate person, given human limitations. John\nHare, In\nGod and Morality (2007) and Divine Command (2015),\ndefends a version of the theory that derives from God's sovereignty\nand defends the theory against the objection that obedience to divine\ncommand itself requires justification. He also compares Christian,\nJewish and Muslim accounts of divine command. Thomas L. Carson's\nValue and the Good Life (2000) argues that normative theory\nneeds to be based on an account of rationality, and then proposes that\na divine-preference account of rationality is superior to all the\navailable alternatives. An objection to divine command theory is\nmounted by Mark Murphy's An Essay on Divine Authority (2002)\nand God and Moral Law (2012) on the grounds that divine\ncommand only has authority over those persons that have submitted\nthemselves to divine authority, but moral obligation has authority\nmore broadly. William Wainwright's Religion and Morality\ndefends the claim that divine command theory provides a more\nconvincing account of moral obligation than any virtue-based theory,\nincluding Zagzebski's divine motivation theory, discussed\nearlier. Finally, C. Stephen Evans, in Kierkegaard's Ethics of\nLove: Divine Commands and Moral Obligations (2004) and\nGod and Moral Obligation(2013) articulates both in\nKierkegaard and in its own right a divine command theory that is\nargued to be superior to all the main alternative non-theist accounts\nof the nature and basis of moral obligation.\n\n\nTo conclude this entry, the revival of interest in divine command\ntheory, when combined with the revival of natural law theory I already\ndiscussed, shows evidence that the attempt to connect morality closely\nto religion is undergoing a robust recovery within professional\nphilosophy.\n",
