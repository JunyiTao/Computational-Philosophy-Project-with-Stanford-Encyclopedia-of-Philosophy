    "main_text": "Basic Elements and Assumptions of Game Theory || On Interpreting Payoffs: Morality and Efficiency in Games\n2.7 On Interpreting Payoffs: Morality and Efficiency in Games\n\nMany readers, but especially philosophers, might wonder why, in the\ncase of the example taken up in the previous section, mechanism design\nshould be necessary unless players are morbidly selfish sociopaths.\nSurely, the players might be able to just see that outcome\n(4, 5) is socially and morally superior; and since the whole problem\nalso takes for granted that they can also see the path of actions that\nleads to this efficient outcome, who is the game theorist to announce\nthat, unless their game is changed, it\u2019s unattainable? This\nobjection, which applies the distinctive idea of rationality urged by\nImmanuel Kant, indicates the leading way in which many philosophers\nmean more by \u2018rationality\u2019 than descriptive game theorists\ndo. This theme is explored with great liveliness and polemical force\nin Binmore\n (1994,\n 1998).\n\nThis weighty philosophical controversy about rationality is sometimes\nconfused by misinterpretation of the meaning of \u2018utility\u2019\nin non-psychological game theory. To root out this mistake, consider\nthe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma again. We have seen that in the unique NE\nof the PD, both players get less utility than they could have through\nmutual cooperation. This may strike you, even if you are not a Kantian\n(as it has struck many commentators) as perverse. Surely, you may\nthink, it simply results from a combination of selfishness and\nparanoia on the part of the players. To begin with they have no regard\nfor the social good, and then they shoot themselves in the feet by\nbeing too untrustworthy to respect agreements.\n\nThis way of thinking is very common in popular discussions, and badly\nmixed up. To dispel its influence, let us first introduce some\nterminology for talking about outcomes. Welfare economists typically\nmeasure social good in terms of Pareto efficiency. A\ndistribution of utility \\(\\beta\\) is said to be Pareto\nsuperior over another distribution \\(\\delta\\) just in case from\nstate \\(\\delta\\) there is a possible redistribution of utility to\n\\(\\beta\\) such that at least one player is better off in \\(\\beta\\)\nthan in \\(\\delta\\) and no player is worse off. Failure to move from a\nPareto-inferior to a Pareto-superior distribution is\ninefficient because the existence of \\(\\beta\\) as a\npossibility, at least in principle, shows that in \\(\\delta\\) some\nutility is being wasted. Now, the outcome (3,3) that represents mutual\ncooperation in our model of the PD is clearly Pareto superior to\nmutual defection; at (3,3) both players are better off than\nat (2,2). So it is true that PDs lead to inefficient outcomes. This\nwas true of our example in Section 2.6 as well.\n\nHowever, inefficiency should not be associated with immorality. A\nutility function for a player is supposed to represent everything\nthat player cares about, which may be anything at all. As we have\ndescribed the situation of our prisoners they do indeed care only\nabout their own relative prison sentences, but there is nothing\nessential in this. What makes a game an instance of the PD is strictly\nand only its payoff structure. Thus we could have two Mother Theresa\ntypes here, both of whom care little for themselves and wish only to\nfeed starving children. But suppose the original Mother Theresa wishes\nto feed the children of Calcutta while Mother Juanita wishes to feed\nthe children of Bogota. And suppose that the international aid agency\nwill maximize its donation if the two saints nominate the same city,\nwill give the second-highest amount if they nominate each\nothers\u2019 cities, and the lowest amount if they each nominate\ntheir own city. Our saints are in a PD here, though hardly selfish or\nunconcerned with the social good.\n\nTo return to our prisoners, suppose that, contrary to our assumptions,\nthey do value each other\u2019s well-being as well as their\nown. In that case, this must be reflected in their utility functions,\nand hence in their payoffs. If their payoff structures are changed so\nthat, for example, they would feel so badly about contributing to\ninefficiency that they\u2019d rather spend extra years in prison than\nendure the shame, then they will no longer be in a PD. But all this\nshows is that not every possible situation is a PD; it does\nnot show that selfishness is among the assumptions of game\ntheory. It is the logic of the prisoners\u2019 situation,\nnot their psychology, that traps them in the inefficient outcome, and\nif that really is their situation then they are stuck in it\n(barring further complications to be discussed below). Agents who wish\nto avoid inefficient outcomes are best advised to prevent certain\ngames from arising; the defender of the possibility of Kantian\nrationality is really proposing that they try to dig themselves out of\nsuch games by turning themselves into different agents.\n\nIn general, then, a game is partly defined by the payoffs\nassigned to the players. In any application, such assignments should\nbe based on sound empirical evidence. If a proposed solution involves\ntacitly changing these payoffs, then this \u2018solution\u2019 is in\nfact a disguised way of changing the subject and evading the\nimplications of best modeling practice.\n",
