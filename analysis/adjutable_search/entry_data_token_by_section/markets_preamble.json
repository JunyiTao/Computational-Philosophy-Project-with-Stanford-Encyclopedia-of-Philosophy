    "main_text": "\n\nMarkets are institutions in which individuals or collective agents\nexchange goods and services. They usually use money as a medium of\nexchange, which leads to the formation of prices. Markets can be\ndistinguished according to the goods or services traded in them (e.g.,\nfinancial markets, housing markets, labor markets), according to their\nscope (e.g., regional, national, international markets), or according\nto their structure (e.g., competitive markets, oligopolistic markets,\nmonopolistic markets). From a normative perspective, markets are of\ninterest for a number of reasons: various arguments for and against\nmarkets relate to central questions of social and political\nphilosophy. In addition, markets depend on, and in turn influence,\nmany other institutions and aspects of social life. They thus\nco-determine the ways in which values such as liberty, justice or\nsolidarity can be realized. Questions as to which markets, for what\ngoods, can be defended by normative arguments, and how they relate to\nother institutions, are therefore at the core of thinking about a just\nsociety.\n\nMarkets are analyzed in a variety of disciplines, including sociology,\nhistory, and, most notably, economics. In philosophy, the interest in\nquestions relating to markets has seen ebbs and flows. Starting\nroughly in the 18th century, one finds debates about a\nsociety in which markets are a social sphere of their own, and have an\nimpact on society as a whole. This article presents the most important\nstrands of the philosophical debate about markets. It offers some\ndistinctions between the concept of markets and related concepts, as\nwell as a brief outline of historical positions vis-\u00e0-vis\nmarkets. The main focus is on presenting the most common arguments for\nand against markets, and on analyzing the ways in which markets are\nrelated to other social institutions. In the concluding section\nquestions about markets are connected to two related themes,\nmethodological questions in economics and the topics of business\nethics and corporate social responsibility.\n",
