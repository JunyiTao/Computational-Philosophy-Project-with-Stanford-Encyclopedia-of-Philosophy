    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy of immunology is a subfield of philosophy of biology\ndealing with ontological and epistemological issues related to the\nstudies of the immune system. While speculative investigations and\nabstract analyses have always been part of immune theorizing, until\nrecently philosophers have largely ignored immunology. Yet the\nimplications for understanding the philosophical basis of organismal\nfunctions framed by immunity offer new perspectives on fundamental\nquestions of biology and medicine. Developed in the context of history\nof medicine, theoretical biology, and medical anthropology, philosophy\nof immunology differs from these related branches of study in its\nfocus on traditional philosophical questions concerning identity,\nindividuality, ecology, cognition, scientific methodology and theory\nconstruction. This broad agenda derives from immunology\u2019s\nmultifaceted research program that has developed from its initial\nclinical challenges of host defense, transplantation, autoimmunity,\ntumor immunology, and allergy. In addition to these well-established\nresearch areas, immunity is now understood to play a central role in\nother physiological functions, development, ecology, and evolutionary\nmechanics. Holding together these diverse domains of inquiry lie\nphilosophical commitments oriented by organismal identity. In this\nregard, pertinent issues are raised concerning \n\n cognition (organization of immune perception and information\nprocessing), \n the character of individuality (framed by the ecological context\nof immune-mediated assimilation and rejection), and \n the dynamics of complex systems (understood as holistic systems\nbiology). \n\n\nIndeed, immunology, in the context of cognitive science, evolutionary\nbiology, environmental sciences, and development provides multi-focal\nperspectives for philosophy of science.\n",
