    "main_text": "Kantian and Neo-Kantian Interpretations || Immunizing Strategies\n3.2 Immunizing Strategies\n\nFollowing the experimental confirmation of the general theory in 1919,\nfew Kantians attempted to retain, unadulterated, all of the components\nof Kant\u2019s epistemological views. Several examples will suffice\nto indicate characteristic \u201cimmunizing strategies\u201d\n(Hentschel 1990). The Habilitationsschrift of E. Sellien\n(1919), read by Einstein in view of his criticism expressed in an\nOctober 1919 letter to Moritz Schlick (Howard 1984: 625), declared\nthat Kant\u2019s views on space and time pertained solely to\nintuitive space; as such Kant\u2019s views were impervious to the\nmeasurable spaces and times of Einstein\u2019s empirical theory. The\nwork of another young Kantian philosopher, Ilse Schneider, personally\nknown to Einstein, affirmed that Kant merely had held that the space\nof three-dimensional Euclidean geometry is the space in which\nNewton\u2019s gravitational law is valid, thus no objections to Kant\ncould be marshalled from the four-dimensional variably curved\nspacetimes of general relativity. Furthermore, Einstein\u2019s\ncosmology (1917b) of a finite but unbounded universe was regarded as\nin complete accord with the \u201ctranscendental solution\u201d to\nthe First Antinomy in the Second Book of the Transcendental Dialectic.\nHer verdict was that apparent contradictions between relativity theory\nand Kantian philosophy disappear on closer examination of both\ndoctrines (Schneider 1921: 71\u201375).\n",
