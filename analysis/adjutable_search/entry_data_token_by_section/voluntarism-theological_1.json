    "main_text": "Metaethical and normative theological voluntarism || Theological voluntarism and theism\n1.1 Theological voluntarism and theism\n\nOne does not have to be a theist in order to be a theological\nvoluntarist. One can affirm normative theological voluntarism or\nmetaethical theological voluntarism while failing to affirm theism;\natheists and agnostics can be theological voluntarists of either\nstripe. With respect to normative theological voluntarism: one might\nclaim that while it is true that any being that merits the title of\n\u2018God\u2019 merits obedience, we should not believe that there\nis such a being. (Compare: if, through some glitch in promotions,\nthere happened to be no lieutenants in the army at some time, it would\nnot cease to be true that privates ought to obey lieutenants. One\ncould believe that that there are no lieutenants while believing that\nprivates ought to obey their lieutenants.) With respect to metaethical\ntheological voluntarism: one might claim that, for example, the\nconcept of obligation is ineliminably theistic, though there is no\nGod; that God does not exist counts not against metaethical\ntheological voluntarism but rather against the claim that the concept\nof obligation has application. (Compare: one might believe that\n\u2018sin\u2019 is properly defined as \u2018offense against\nGod.\u2019 One can clearly affirm this definition while rejecting\nGod\u2019s existence; all that one is committed to thereby is that\nthere really are no sins.)\n",
