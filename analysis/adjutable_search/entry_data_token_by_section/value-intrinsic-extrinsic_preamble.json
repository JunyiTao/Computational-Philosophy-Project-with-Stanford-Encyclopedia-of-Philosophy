    "main_text": "\n\nIntrinsic value has traditionally been thought to lie at the heart of\nethics. Philosophers use a number of terms to refer to such value. The\nintrinsic value of something is said to be the value that that thing\nhas \u201cin itself,\u201d or \u201cfor its own sake,\u201d or\n\u201cas such,\u201d or \u201cin its own right.\u201d Extrinsic\nvalue is value that is not intrinsic.\n\nMany philosophers take intrinsic value to be crucial to a variety of\nmoral judgments. For example, according to a fundamental form of\nconsequentialism, whether an action is morally right or wrong\nhas exclusively to do with whether its consequences are intrinsically\nbetter than those of any other action one can perform under the\ncircumstances. Many other theories also hold that what it is right or\nwrong to do has at least in part to do with the intrinsic value of the\nconsequences of the actions one can perform. Moreover, if, as is\ncommonly believed, what one is morally responsible for doing\nis some function of the rightness or wrongness of what one does, then\nintrinsic value would seem relevant to judgments about responsibility,\ntoo. Intrinsic value is also often taken to be pertinent to judgments\nabout moral justice (whether having to do with moral rights\nor moral desert), insofar as it is good that justice is done and bad\nthat justice is denied, in ways that appear intimately tied to\nintrinsic value. Finally, it is typically thought that judgments about\nmoral virtue and vice also turn on questions of intrinsic\nvalue, inasmuch as virtues are good, and vices bad, again in ways that\nappear closely connected to such value.\n\nAll four types of moral judgments have been the subject of discussion\nsince the dawn of western philosophy in ancient Greece. The Greeks\nthemselves were especially concerned with questions about virtue and\nvice, and the concept of intrinsic value may be found at work in their\nwritings and in the writings of moral philosophers ever since. Despite\nthis fact, and rather surprisingly, it is only within the last one\nhundred years or so that this concept has itself been the subject of\nsustained scrutiny, and even within this relatively brief period the\nscrutiny has waxed and waned.\n",
