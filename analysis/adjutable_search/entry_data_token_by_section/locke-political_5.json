    "main_text": "Separation of Powers and the Dissolution of Government\n6. Separation of Powers and the Dissolution of Government\n\nLocke claims that legitimate government is based on the idea of\nseparation of powers. First and foremost of these is the legislative\npower. Locke describes the legislative power as supreme (Two\nTreatises 2.149) in having ultimate authority over \u201chow the\nforce for the commonwealth shall be employed\u201d (2.143). The\nlegislature is still bound by the law of nature and much of what it\ndoes is set down laws that further the goals of natural law and\nspecify appropriate punishments for them (2.135). The executive power\nis then charged with enforcing the law as it is applied in specific\ncases. Interestingly, Locke\u2019s third power is called the\n\u201cfederative power\u201d and it consists of the right to act\ninternationally according to the law of nature. Since countries are\nstill in the state of nature with respect to each other, they must\nfollow the dictates of natural law and can punish one another for\nviolations of that law in order to protect the rights of their\ncitizens.\n\nThe fact that Locke does not mention the judicial power as a separate\npower becomes clearer if we distinguish powers from institutions.\nPowers relate to functions. To have a power means that there is a\nfunction (such as making the laws or enforcing the laws) that one may\nlegitimately perform. When Locke says that the legislative is supreme\nover the executive, he is not saying that parliament is supreme over\nthe king. Locke is simply affirming that \u201cwhat can give laws to\nanother, must needs be superior to him\u201d (Two Treatises\n2.150). Moreover, Locke thinks that it is possible for multiple\ninstitutions to share the same power; for example, the legislative\npower in his day was shared by the House of Commons, the House of\nLords, and the King. Since all three needed to agree for something to\nbecome law, all three are part of the legislative power (1.151). He\nalso thinks that the federative power and the executive power are\nnormally placed in the hands of the executive, so it is possible for\nthe same person to exercise more than one power (or function). There\nis, therefore, no one-to-one correspondence between powers and\ninstitutions (Tuckness 2002a).\n\nLocke is not opposed to having distinct institutions called courts,\nbut he does not see interpretation as a distinct function or power.\nFor Locke, legislation is primarily about announcing a general rule\nstipulating what types of actions should receive what types of\npunishments. The executive power is the power to make the judgments\nnecessary to apply those rules to specific cases and administer force\nas directed by the rule (Two Treatises 2.88\u201389). Both\nof these actions involve interpretation. Locke states that positive\nlaws \u201care only so far right, as they are founded on the law of\nnature, by which they are to be regulated and interpreted\u201d\n(2.12). In other words, the executive must interpret the laws in light\nof its understanding of natural law. Similarly, legislation involves\nmaking the laws of nature more specific and determining how to apply\nthem to particular circumstances (2.135) which also calls for\ninterpreting natural law. Locke did not think of interpreting law as a\ndistinct function because he thought it was a part of both the\nlegislative and executive functions (Tuckness 2002a).\n\nIf we compare Locke\u2019s formulation of separation of powers to the\nlater ideas of Montesquieu (1989), we see that they are not so\ndifferent as they may initially appear. Although Montesquieu gives the\nmore well known division of legislative, executive, and judicial, as\nhe explains what he means by these terms he reaffirms the superiority\nof the legislative power and describes the executive power as having\nto do with international affairs (Locke\u2019s federative power) and\nthe judicial power as concerned with the domestic execution of the\nlaws (Locke\u2019s executive power). It is more the terminology than\nthe concepts that have changed. Locke considered arresting a person,\ntrying a person, and punishing a person as all part of the function of\nexecuting the law rather than as a distinct function (Tuckness\n2002a).\n\nLocke believed that it was important that the legislative power\ncontain an assembly of elected representatives, but as we have seen\nthe legislative power could contain monarchical and aristocratic\nelements as well. Locke believed the people had the freedom to create\n\u201cmixed\u201d constitutions that utilize all of these. For that\nreason, Locke\u2019s theory of separation of powers does not dictate\none particular type of constitution and does not preclude unelected\nofficials from having part of the legislative power. Locke was more\nconcerned that the people have representatives with sufficient power\nto block attacks on their liberty and attempts to tax them without\njustification. This is important because Locke also affirms that the\ncommunity remains the real supreme power throughout. The people retain\nthe right to \u201cremove or alter\u201d the legislative power\n(Two Treatises 2.149). This can happen for a variety of\nreasons. The entire society can be dissolved by a successful foreign\ninvasion (2.211), but Locke is more interested in describing the\noccasions when the people take power back from the government to which\nthey have entrusted it. If the rule of law is ignored, if the\nrepresentatives of the people are prevented from assembling, if the\nmechanisms of election are altered without popular consent, or if the\npeople are handed over to a foreign power, then they can take back\ntheir original authority and overthrow the government\n(2.212\u201317). They can also rebel if the government attempts to\ntake away their rights (2.222). Locke thinks this is justifiable since\noppressed people will likely rebel anyway, and those who are not\noppressed will be unlikely to rebel. Moreover, the threat of possible\nrebellion makes tyranny less likely to start with (2.224\u20136). For\nall these reasons, while there are a variety of legitimate\nconstitutional forms, the delegation of power under any constitution\nis understood to be conditional.\n\nLocke\u2019s understanding of separation of powers is complicated by\nthe doctrine of prerogative. Prerogative is the right of the executive\nto act without explicit authorization for a law, or even contrary to\nthe law, in order to better fulfill the laws that seek the\npreservation of human life. A king might, for example, order that a\nhouse be torn down in order to stop a fire from spreading throughout a\ncity (Two Treatises 2.159). Locke defines it more broadly as\n\u201cthe power of doing public good without a rule\u201d (2.166).\nThis poses a challenge to Locke\u2019s doctrine of legislative\nsupremacy. Locke handles this by explaining that the rationale for\nthis power is that general rules cannot cover all possible cases and\nthat inflexible adherence to the rules would be detrimental to the\npublic good and that the legislature is not always in session to\nrender a judgment (2.160). The relationship between the executive and\nthe legislature depends on the specific constitution. If the chief\nexecutive has no part in the supreme legislative power, then the\nlegislature could overrule the executive\u2019s decisions based on\nprerogative when it reconvenes. If, however, the chief executive has a\nveto, the result would be a stalemate between them. Locke describes a\nsimilar stalemate in the case where the chief executive has the power\nto call parliament and can thus prevent it from meeting by refusing to\ncall it into session. In such a case, Locke says, there is no judge on\nearth between them as to whether the executive has misused prerogative\nand both sides have the right to \u201cappeal to heaven\u201d in the\nsame way that the people can appeal to heaven against a tyrannical\ngovernment (2.168).\n\nThe concept of an \u201cappeal to heaven\u201d is an important\nconcept in Locke\u2019s thought. Locke assumes that people, when they\nleave the state of nature, create a government with some sort of\nconstitution that specifies which entities are entitled to exercise\nwhich powers. Locke also assumes that these powers will be used to\nprotect the rights of the people and to promote the public good. In\ncases where there is a dispute between the people and the government\nabout whether the government is fulfilling its obligations, there is\nno higher human authority to which one can appeal. The only appeal\nleft, for Locke, is the appeal to God. The \u201cappeal to\nheaven,\u201d therefore, involves taking up arms against your\nopponent and letting God judge who is in the right.\n",
