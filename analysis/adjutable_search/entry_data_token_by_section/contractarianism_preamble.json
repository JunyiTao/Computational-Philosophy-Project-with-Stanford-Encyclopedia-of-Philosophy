    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cContractarianism\u201d names both a political theory of the\nlegitimacy of political authority and a moral theory about the origin\nor legitimate content of moral norms. The political theory of\nauthority claims that legitimate authority of government must derive\nfrom the consent of the governed, where the form and content of this\nconsent derives from the idea of contract or mutual agreement. The\nmoral theory of contractarianism claims that moral norms derive their\nnormative force from the idea of contract or mutual agreement.\nContractarians are skeptical of the possibility of grounding morality\nor political authority in either divine will or some perfectionist\nideal of the nature of humanity. Social contract theorists from the\nhistory of political thought include Hobbes, Locke, Kant, and\nRousseau. The most important contemporary political social contract\ntheorist is John Rawls, who effectively resurrected social contract\ntheory in the second half of the 20th century, along with David\nGauthier, who is primarily a moral contractarian. There is no\nnecessity for a contractarian about political theory to be a\ncontractarian about moral theory, although most contemporary\ncontractarians are both. It has been more recently recognized that\nthere are two distinct strains of social contract thought, which now\ntypically go by the names contractarianism and\n contractualism.\n\nContractarianism, which stems from the Hobbesian line of social\ncontract thought, holds that persons are primarily self-interested,\nand that a rational assessment of the best strategy for attaining the\nmaximization of their self-interest will lead them to act morally\n(where the moral norms are determined by the maximization of joint\ninterest) and to consent to governmental authority. Contractarianism\nargues that we each are motivated to accept morality \u201cfirst\nbecause we are vulnerable to the depredations of others, and second\nbecause we can all benefit from cooperation with others\u201d\n(Narveson 1988, 148). Contractualism, which stems from the Kantian\nline of social contract thought, holds that rationality requires that\nwe respect persons, which in turn requires that moral principles be\nsuch that they can be justified to each person. Thus, individuals are\nnot taken to be motivated by self-interest but rather by a commitment\nto publicly justify the standards of morality to which each will be\nheld. Where Gauthier, Narveson, or economist James Buchanan are the\nparadigm Hobbesian contractarians, Rawls or Thomas Scanlon would be\nthe paradigm Kantian contractualists. The rest of this entry will\nspecifically pertain to the contractarian strain wherever the two\ndiverge.\n",
