    "main_text": "Non-monotonic logic and human reasoning\n4. Non-monotonic logic and human reasoning\n\nIn view of the fact that test subjects seem to perform very poorly in\nvarious paradigmatic reasoning tests (e.g., Wason\u2019s Selection Task\n (Wason 1966)\n or the Supression Task\n (Byrne 1989)),\n main streams in the psychology of reasoning have traditionally\nascribed to logic at best a subordinate role in human reasoning. In\nrecent years this assessment has been criticized as the result of\nevaluating performances in tests against the standard of classical\nlogic whereas other standards based on probabilistic considerations or\non NMLs have been argued to be more appropriate. \n\nThis resulted in the rise of a new probabilistic paradigm\n (Oaksford and Chater 2007,\n Pfeifer and Douven 2014) where \nprobability theory provides a calculus for\nrational belief update. Although the program is sometimes phrased in\ndecidedly anti-logicist\n terms,[7]\n logic is here usually understood as monotonic and deductive. The\nrelation to NML is less clear and it has been argued that there are\nclose connections especially to probabilistic accounts of NML\n (Over 2009,\n Pfeifer and Kleiter 2009).\n Politzer and Bonnefon 2009\n warn against the premature acceptance of the probabilistic paradigm\nin view of the rich variety of alternatives such as possibility\nmeasures, plausibility measures, etc.).\n \n\nAnother argument for the relevance of NML is advocated in\n Stenning and Van Lambalgen (2008)\n who distinguish between reasoning to and reasoning from\nan interpretation. In the former process agents establish a logical\nform that is relative both to the specific context in which the\nreasoning takes place and to the agent\u2019s goals. When establishing a\nlogical form agents choose\u2014inter alia\u2014a formal language, a\nsemantics (e.g., extensional vs. intensional), a notion of validity,\netc. Once a logical form is established, agents engage in lawlike\nrule-based inferences which are based on this form. It is argued that\nin the majority of cases in standard reasoning tasks, subjects use\nnon-monontonic logical forms that are based on closed world\nassumptions. \n\nNon-monotonic logicians often state that their motivation stems from\nobserving the defeasible structure of actual commonsense reasoning.\nEmpirical studies have been explicitly cited as both inspiration for\nworking on NMLs and as standards against which to evaluate NMLs.\nHowever, it has also been noted that logicians often rely too much on\ntheir own intuitions without critically assessing them against the\nbackground of empirical studies\n (Pelletier and Elio 1997).\n \n\nVarious studies investigate their test subjects\u2019 tendency to reason\naccording to specific inference principles of NMLs. Most studies\nsupport the descriptive adequacy of the rules of system P. There are,\nhowever, some open or controversial issues. For instance, while some\nstudies report results suggestive of the adequacy of weakened monotony\nprinciples such as Cautious Monotony\n (Schurz 2005,\n Neves et al. 2002,\n Pfeifer and Kleiter 2005)\n and Rational Monotony\n (Neves et al. 2002),\n Benferhat et al. (2005) report mixed results. Specificity considerations play a\nrole in the reasoning process of test subjects in\n Schurz (2005),\n whereas according to\n Ford and Billington (2000)\n they do not.\n Benferhat et al. (2005)\n are specifically interested in the question whether the responses of\ntheir test subjects corresponded better to Lexicographic Closure or to\nRational Closure. While the results were not fully conclusive they\nstill suggest a preference for the former. \n\nPelletier and Elio (1994)\n investigate various relevant factors that influence subjects\u2019\nreasoning about exceptions of defaults or inheritance relations. Their\nstudy makes use of the benchmark problems for defeasible reasoning\nproposed in\n Lifschitz (1989).\n It is, for instance, observed that the exceptional status of an\nobject A with respect to some default is more likely to spread\nto other objects if they share properties with A that may play\na role in explaining the exceptional status. For example, when\nconfronted with a student club that violates the default that student\nclubs only allow for student members, subjects are more likely to\nascribe this exceptional status also to another club if they learn\nthat both clubs have been struggling to maintain minimum membership\nrequirements. \n\nThe question of the descriptive adequacy of NMLs to human reasoning is\nalso related to questions concerning the nature and limits of\ncognitive modules in view of which agents are capable of logical\nreasoning. For instance, the question arises, whether such modules\ncould be realized on a neurological level. Concerning the former\nquestion there are successful representations of NMLs in terms of\nneural networks (see\n Stenning and Van Lambalgen (2008),\n Garcez et al (2009),\n H\u00f6lldobler and Kalinke (1994)\n for\n logic programming\n with closed world assumptions,\n Besold et al (2017)\n for input/output logic, and\n Leitgeb (2001)\n for NMLs in the tradition of\n Selection semantics).\n \n",
