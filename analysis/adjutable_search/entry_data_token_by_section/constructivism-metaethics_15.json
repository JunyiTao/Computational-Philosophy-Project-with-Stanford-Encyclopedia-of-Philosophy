    "main_text": "The Euthyphro Question\n7. The Euthyphro Question\n\nConstructivism\u2019s insight is that practical truths should be\nexplained in terms of the constitutive features of practical\nreasoning, which the notion of \u2018construction\u2019 is supposed\nto capture. But critics argue that the constructivist conception of\npractical reasoning is either arbitrary or parasitic on independent\nmoral values. The objection often takes the form of a metaethical\ndilemma similar to the dilemma discussed by Plato in the\nEuthyphro (10a). Either the practical standpoint is subject\nto moral constraints or it is not. If it is not, then \n\n\nthere is no reason to expect that the principles that emerge \u2026\nwill capture our deepest convictions, or respect various platitudes\nthat fix our understanding of ethical concepts. (Shafer-Landau 2003:\n42) \n\n\nIf it is, then the constraints are not themselves constructed and\nacceptance of them commits one to realism (Shafer-Landau 2003: 42).\nConstructivism thus either grounds moral truths on arbitrary standards\nor collapses into realism.\n\nThere are at least two ways of formulating and motivating this\nobjection. First, the objection can be that constructivism relies on\nmoral intuitions, which it never proves. Second, the objection can be\nthat the appeal to unconstructed norms that govern and constitute the\nactivity of rational choice commits one to realism.\n",
