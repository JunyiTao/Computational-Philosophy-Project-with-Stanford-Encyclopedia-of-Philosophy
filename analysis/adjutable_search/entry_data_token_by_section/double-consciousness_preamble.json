    "main_text": "\n\nDouble-consciousness is a concept in social philosophy\nreferring, originally, to a source of inward \u201ctwoness\u201d\nputatively experienced by African-Americans because of their\nracialized oppression and disvaluation in a white-dominated society.\nThe concept is associated with William Edward Burghardt Du Bois, who\nintroduced the term into social thought in his groundbreaking The\nSouls of Black Folk (1903). Its source has been traced back from\nthere, by recent commentators, to the development of clinical\npsychology in the nineteenth-century North Atlantic, and to trends in\nidealist philosophies of self \u2013 the transcendentalism of Ralph\nWaldo Emerson and G.W.F. Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology of\nSpirit. It is thus indirectly related to other nineteenth- and\ntwentieth-century riffs on Hegelian themes, such as false\nconsciousness and bad faith. In our day it continues to be used by\nnumerous commentators on racialized cultures, societies, and\nliteratures; by cultural and literary theorists; and by students and\nresearchers of Africana Philosophy. Recent philosophical debates\ncenter on the significance of the concept for Du Bois\u2019s thought\noverall, its theoretical coherence, and its relevance given current\nsocial conditions.\n",
