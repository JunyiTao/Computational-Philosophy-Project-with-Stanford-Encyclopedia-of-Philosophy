    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nThe son of an Anglican clergyman, Whitehead graduated from Cambridge\nin 1884 and was elected a Fellow of Trinity College that same year.\nHis marriage to Evelyn Wade six years later was largely a happy one\nand together they had a daughter (Jessie) and two sons (North and\nEric). After moving to London, Whitehead served as president of the\nAristotelian Society from 1922 to 1923. After moving to Harvard, he\nwas elected to the British Academy in 1931. His moves to both London\nand Harvard were prompted in part by institutional regulations\nrequiring mandatory retirement, although his resignation from\nCambridge was also done partly in protest over how the University had\nchosen to discipline Andrew Forsyth, a friend and colleague whose\naffair with a married woman had become something of a local\nscandal.\n\nIn addition to Russell, Whitehead influenced many other students who\nbecame equally or more famous than their teacher, examiner or\nsupervisor himself. For example: mathematicians G. H. Hardy and J. E.\nLittlewood; mathematical physicists Edmund Whittaker, Arthur\nEddington, and James Jeans; economist J. M. Keynes; and philosophers\nSusanne Langer, Nelson Goodman, and Willard van Orman Quine. Whitehead\ndid not, however, inspire any school of thought during his lifetime,\nand most of his students distanced themselves from parts of his\nteachings that they considered anachronistic. For example:\nWhitehead\u2019s conviction that pure mathematics and applied\nmathematics should not be separated, but cross-fertilize each other,\nwas not shared by Hardy, but seen as a remnant of the fading mixed\nmathematics tradition; after the birth of the theories of relativity\nand quantum physics, Whitehead\u2019s method of abstracting some of\nthe basic concepts of mathematical physics from common experiences\nseemed antiquated compared to Eddington\u2019s method of world\nbuilding, which aimed at constructing an experiment matching world\nfrom mathematical building blocks; when, due to Whitehead\u2019s\njudgment as one of the examiners, Keynes had to rewrite his fellowship\ndissertation, Keynes raged against Whitehead, claiming that Whitehead\nhad not bothered to try to understand Keynes\u2019 novel approach to\nprobability; and Whitehead\u2019s main philosophical\ndoctrine\u2014that the world is composed of deeply interdependent\nprocesses and events, rather than mostly independent material things\nor objects\u2014turned out to be largely the opposite of\nRussell\u2019s doctrine of logical atomism, and his metaphysics was\ndispelled by the logical positivists from their dream land of pure\nscientific philosophy.\n\nDespite the fact that he did not inspire any school of thought during\nhis life, his influence on contemporaries was significant. The\nlate Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Felix\nFrankfurter, wrote:\n\n\nFrom knowledge gained through the years of the personalities who in\nour day have affected American university life, I have for some time\nbeen convinced that no single figure has had such a pervasive\ninfluence as the late Professor Alfred North Whitehead. (New York\nTimes, January 8, 1948)\n\n\nMoreover, Whitehead\u2019s philosophical views posthumously inspired\nthe movement of process philosophy and theology, and today\nWhitehead\u2019s ideas continue to be felt and are revalued in\nvarying degrees in all of the main areas in which he worked. One of\nthe most important factors in recent Whitehead scholarship is the\ngradual publishing of volumes of The Edinburgh Critical Edition of\nthe Complete Works of Alfred North Whitehead. Two volumes of\nThe Harvard Lectures of Alfred North Whitehead, mainly\ncontaining student notes of lectures and seminars given by\nWhitehead at Harvard from September 1924 until May 1927,\nhave already been published by Edinburgh University Press in\n2017 and 2021 respectively (see the Primary Literature section of the\nBibliography below), and four more volumes are on their\nway. Their publication is a stimulus for Whitehead\nresearchers all over the world, as is clear from the 2020 book edited\nby Brian Henning and Joseph Petek, Whitehead at Harvard,\n1924\u20131925.\n\nA short chronology of the major events in Whitehead\u2019s life is\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n1861\nBorn February 15 in Ramsgate, Isle of Thanet, Kent,\nEngland. \n\n1880\nEnters Trinity College, Cambridge, with a scholarship in\nmathematics. \n\n1884\nElected to the Apostles, the elite discussion club founded by\nTennyson in the 1820s; graduates with a B.A. in Mathematics; elected a\nFellow in Mathematics at Trinity. \n\n1890\nMeets Russell; marries Evelyn Wade. \n\n1903\nElected a Fellow of the Royal Society as a result of his work on\nuniversal algebra, symbolic logic, and the foundations of\nmathematics. \n\n1910\nResigns from Cambridge and moves to London. \n\n1911\nAppointed Lecturer at University College London. \n\n1912\nElected President of both the South-Eastern Mathematical\nAssociation and the London branch of the Mathematical Association for\nthe year 1913. \n\n1914\nAppointed Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Imperial\nCollege of Science and Technology. \n\n1915\nElected President of the Mathematical Association for the\ntwo-year period 1915\u20131917. \n\n1921\nMeets Albert Einstein. \n\n1922\nElected President of the Aristotelian Society for the one-year\nperiod 1922\u20131923. \n\n1924\nAppointed Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University.\n\n\n1931\nElected a Fellow of the British Academy. \n\n1937\nRetires from Harvard. \n\n1945\nAwarded Order of Merit. \n\n1947\nDies December 30 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. \n\n\n\n\nMore detailed information about Whitehead\u2019s life can be found in\nthe comprehensive two-volume biography A.N. Whitehead: The Man and\nHis Work (1985, 1990) by Victor Lowe and J.B. Schneewind. Paul\nSchilpp\u2019s The Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead\n(1941) also includes a short autobiographical essay, in addition to\nproviding a comprehensive critical overview of Whitehead\u2019s\nthought and a detailed bibliography of his writings.\n\nOther helpful introductions to Whitehead\u2019s work include Victor\nLowe\u2019s Understanding Whitehead (1962), Stephen\nFranklin\u2019s Speaking from the Depths (1990), Thomas\nHosinski\u2019s Stubborn Fact and Creative Advance (1993),\nElizabeth Kraus\u2019 The Metaphysics of Experience (1998),\nRobert Mesle\u2019s Process-Relational Philosophy\n(2008), John Cobb\u2019s Whitehead Word Book (2015) and\nJay McDaniel\u2019s What is Process Thought? (2021). Recommendable\nfor the more advanced Whitehead student are Ivor Leclerc\u2019s\nWhitehead\u2019s Metaphysics (1958), Wolfe Mays\u2019\nThe Philosophy of Whitehead (1959), Donald Sherburne\u2019s\nA Whiteheadian Aesthetics (1961), Charles Hartshorne\u2019s\nWhitehead\u2019s Philosophy (1972), Lewis Ford\u2019s The\nEmergence of Whitehead\u2019s Metaphysics (1984), George Lucas\u2019\nThe Rehabilitation of Whitehead (1989), David Griffin\u2019s\nWhitehead\u2019s Radically Different Postmodern Philosophy\n(2007), Steven Shaviro\u2019s Without Criteria\n(2009), Isabelle Stengers\u2019 Thinking with Whitehead\n(2011), and Didier Debaise\u2019s Speculative Empiricism: Revisiting\nWhitehead (2017a).
