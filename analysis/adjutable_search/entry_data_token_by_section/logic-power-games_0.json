    "main_text": "The Logic Underneath Games\n1. The Logic Underneath Games\n\nA game is a mathematical description of the relation\nbetween a set of individuals (or groups of\nindividuals) and a set of potential outcomes.\nIndividuals choose, independently and concurrently, a\nsubset of the outcomes, with the final outcome being selected from the\ncombination of each choice. Independently means that\nindividuals\u2019 choices do not influence one another.\nConcurrently means that each individual\u2019s choices are\ntaken not knowing the other players\u2019 choices. Each individual is\nassumed to have a preference over the set of outcomes, i.e., he or she\nlikes some outcomes more than others, and typically assumed to know\nthe other individuals\u2019 potential choices and preferences,\nadjusting their decisions accordingly.\n\nGames are used to model all sorts of situations, ranging from animal\nbehavior to international conflict resolution (Osborne &\nRubinstein 1994). A useful application for the purpose of this entry\nis collective decision-making, an instance of which is going to be the\nworking example throughout.\n\n\nExample 1 (The treaty of Rome). The treaty of Rome\n(1958\u20131973) established the European Economic Community.\nAccording to Article 148 of the Treaty, acts of the Council (one of\nthe main legislative institutions) required for their adoption:\n\n12 votes (if the act was proposed by the Commission), or\n12 votes by at least 4 member states (if the act was not proposed\nby the Commission).\n\n\nThe values above refer to the EU-6, the founding member states. The\ntreaty allocated the votes as follows:\n\n4 votes: France, Germany, Italy;\n2 votes: Belgium, The Netherlands;\n1 vote: Luxembourg.\n\n\nThis scenario can be described as a game.\n\nThere are six players, the Countries:\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n\nThey vote on one issue at the time. Issues can be binary, e.g., the\nadoption of a border-protection scheme, or multi-valued, e.g., how\nmany millions should be spent on the adoption of a border-protection\nscheme.\n\nCountries might have preferences over the outcome of the vote\nor even over the other Countries\u2019 specific vote, and they\nusually vote without knowing how the others have voted.\n\nOften times, these games are such that no participant is, alone,\ncapable of deciding the final outcome, but, in some cases, they could\ncooperate and agree on a joint strategy.\n\n\nDepending on players\u2019 preferences, knowledge and capabilities\nsome outcomes will be more likely to be chosen. In order to understand\nwhich ones, game theory has devised solution concepts, formally\nfunctions from the set of games to the set of outcomes in each of\nthese games, which describe players\u2019 rationality in mathematical\nterms. Solution concepts, as we will see later, can be succinctly\nexpressed in simple and well-behaved logics.\n\nNext we describe games as mathematical structures, emphasizing various\nkey ingredients (e.g., the possibility of forming coalitions, the\npossibility to take decisions in time etc.) and the best suited\nlanguages to express them.\n",
