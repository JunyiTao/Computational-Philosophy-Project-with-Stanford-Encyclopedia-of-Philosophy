    "main_text": "Interactivity || Defining Interactive Works\n4.1 Defining Interactive Works\n\nNot all digital works are interactive, and not all interactive works\nare digital. However, since computers are inherently interactive, much\nof the early philosophical literature on interactivity arose from the\nemergence of computer art (also see Smuts 2009; Lopes 2001; Saltz\n1997). The distinctive character of interactive digital art is best\nconsidered in tandem with the work\u2019s ontology.\n\nBefore analyzing interactivity any further, first, consider the\nfollowing description of the digital installation \u201cUniverse of\nWater Particles on a Rock where People Gather\u201d (henceforth,\n\u201cRock where People Gather\u201d) by TeamLab:\n\n\n\u201cRock where People Gather\u201d is reproduced in a virtual\nthree-dimensional space. Water is simulated to fall onto the rock, and\nthe flow of the water draws the shape of the waterfall. The water is\nrepresented by a continuum of numerous water particles and the\ninteraction between the particles is then calculated. Lines are drawn\nin relation to the behavior of the water particles. The lines are then\n\u201cflattened\u201d using what TeamLab considers to be\n\u201cultrasubjective\u201d space.\n\nWhen a person stands on the rock or touches the waterfall, they too\nbecome like a rock that changes the flow of water. The flow of water\ncontinues to transform in real time due to the interaction of people.\nPrevious visual states can never be replicated, and will never reoccur\n(TeamLab 2018).\n\n\n\u201cRock where People Gather\u201d illustrates that interactive\nworks permit us to appreciate both the work and the properties brought\nabout by the interactions. To define these characteristics of\ninteractive art, Dominic Lopes states, \u201cA work of art\nis interactive just in case it prescribes that the\nactions of its users help generate its\ndisplay\u201d (Lopes 2010:36, original emphasis). The display is\nanything that is instanced in a work, or the perceptual properties\nthat come about via interactivity. Users help generate these features\nmaking interactive works distinctive. However, at this point, one\ncould imagine reading the chapters of, let us say, a digitized copy of\nThe Brothers Karamazov in random order, thereby changing what\nproperties get instanced from the original work. Does this example\nqualify as interactive art in the Lopesian sense? Although some\nstories, such as choose-your-own-adventure books, allow readers to\nshuffle the narrative arc, most traditional stories do not; if the\nrandomized Karamazov example is interactive, it is only so in\nthe weakest sense of the term because users are not\nprescribed to change the properties as described. Another way\nto think about these differences returns us to a work\u2019s\nstructure. Readers who decide to roguishly randomize a story merely\nchange how they access a work\u2019s structure simply\nbecause the medium does not prohibit it, whereas readers of\nchoose-your-own-adventure books and other interactive works can change\nthe work\u2019s structure in a prescribed manner (Lopes\n2001:68).\n",
