    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || Equal opportunity\n2.3 Equal opportunity\n\nA classic example of meritocracy (perhaps first used by Lyndon Johnson\nin a 4 June 1965 address at Howard University) is a footrace. Justice\nis done\u2014the race is fair\u2014only if the medal is given to the\nrunner who crosses the finish line first (and not, say, to the runner\nwith the lightest skin). However, that is a necessary, not a\nsufficient, condition for justice. For if some runners had a head\nstart\u2014if there was unequal opportunity\u2014then the\nrace was unjust, and the \u201cwinner\u201d has no moral claim on\nthe medal. But if the medal is awarded purely on the basis of merit,\nand against a background of equal opportunity, then the winner\ndeserves that medal, and justice has been done.\n\nIn a meritocracy there is an \u201cequal starting line\u201d (or, to\nuse another common, athletic metaphor, a \u201clevel playing\nfield\u201d) from which people compete for scarce social goods. That\nequal starting line, when coupled with a merit-based distributive\nrule, provides a full theory of distributive justice. (For more on the\nconnection between meritocracy and equal opportunity, see Arneson 2002\n[2015], Daniels 1978, Mulligan 2018b, and Goldman 1977.)\n\nSometimes the aforementioned idea of equal opportunity is referred to\nas \u201cfair\u201d or \u201csubstantive\u201d equal opportunity,\nand the merit-based distributive rule as \u201cformal\u201d equal\nopportunity. When things are put in those terms, a meritocracy is\nsimply a society in which there is equal opportunity (fair and\nformal).\n\nWhile the equal starting line metaphor is handwavy, equal opportunity\nhas been made rigorous (see Roemer 1998). And the ideal has clear\nramifications for public policy, such as estate/inheritance taxes (so\npeople don\u2019t accrue wealth on the basis of family circumstances\ninstead of merit) and public education (so that the children of poor\nfamilies receive the same quality education as the children of the\nrich).\n\nThere are two salient debates within the equal opportunity literature\nimportant to meritocracy. The first is whether there is a moral\ndifference between (i) social advantage, like being born into\na rich family, and (ii) natural advantage\u2014like\nintelligence (important: insofar as it is genetically- rather than\nenvironmentally-derived). The meritocrat is committed to nullifying\nthe former through equal opportunity, but what about the latter?\n(Nullifying natural advantage would consist in providing extra\nresources to those who are naturally disadvantaged.)\n\nThe second debate involves the extent to which the state may interfere\nin family affairs to establish equal opportunity (see Fishkin 1983).\nEven with robust \u201cexternal\u201d measures (estate taxes, public\neducation), different families will show different degrees of care for\ntheir children. That will lead to some inequality of opportunity.\n\nIndeed, different kinds of care\u2014not just parental\nattention versus neglect\u2014may lead to inequalities of\nopportunity. One family may inculcate a love and aptitude for music in\ntheir child; another family may stress sports. The philosophical\nissues here are to explain what is problematic and what is not, and to\ndraw the line between the government\u2019s interest in establishing\nequal opportunity and the liberty of parents to raise their children\nas they see fit.\n",
