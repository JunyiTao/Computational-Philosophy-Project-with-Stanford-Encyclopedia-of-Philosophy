    "main_text": "Original Works || Be\u1e25inat ha-Dat\n4. Conclusion: Impact and Legacy\n\nIn the Hebrew versions of his philosophical works, as well as in\nBe\u1e25inat ha-Dat, Del Medigo explicitly refers to himself\nas a Jewish sage and disciple of Maimonides, and often downplays the\nimportance of his own Aristotelian compositions. Del Medigo would\ntherefore have been pleased to discover that in modern scholarship he\nis mainly remembered as a Jewish thinker. Yet by judging the content\nof his Italian works, which constitute the bulk of his literary\noutput, Del Medigo\u2019s contribution to the history of philosophy\nis manifested in that he was among the first to merge, in his\ntranslations as well as in his original works, the Hebrew and Latin\nAverroist schools, which until his day existed as two separate\nphilosophical traditions. By doing so, Del Medigo contributed to the\ncreation of a unified corpus of Averroes\u2019 works, which had a\ndecisive impact on the Aristotelian Renaissance tradition and up until\nthe early modern period. In other words, despite his religious\naffiliation, Del Medigo\u2019s contribution lies clearly within the\nrealm of the Aristotelian tradition, which, qua philosophical\ntradition, transcends religious and linguistic boundaries.\n",
