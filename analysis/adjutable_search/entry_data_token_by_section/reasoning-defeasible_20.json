    "main_text": "Logical Approaches || Metalogical Desiderata\n5.2 Metalogical Desiderata\n\nOnce monotonicity is given up, the question arises: why call the\nrelation of defeasible consequence a logical consequence\nrelation at all? What properties do defeasible consequence and\nclassical logical consequence have in common, that would justify\ntreating them as sub-classes of the same category? What justifies\ncalling nonmonotonic consequence logical?\n\nTo count as logical, there are certain minimal properties\nthat a relation must satisfy. First, the relation ought to permit\nreasoning by lemmas or subconclusions. That is, if a proposition\n\\(p\\) already follows from a set \\(\\Gamma\\), then it should make no\ndifference to add \\(p\\) to \\(\\Gamma\\) as an additional premise.\nRelations that satisfy this condition are called cumulative.\nCumulative relations satisfy the following two conditions (where\n\u201c\\(C(\\Gamma)\\)\u201d represents the set of defeasible\nconsequences of \\(\\Gamma)\\):\n\nCut:\nIf \\(\\Gamma \\subseteq \\Delta \\subseteq C(\\Gamma)\\), then \\(C(\\Delta) \\subseteq C(\\Gamma)\\).\n\nCautious Monotony: \nIf \\(\\Gamma \\subseteq \\Delta\n\\subseteq C(\\Gamma)\\), then \\(C(\\Gamma) \\subseteq C(\\Delta)\\).\n\nIn addition, a defeasible consequence relation ought to be\nsupraclassical: if \\(p\\) follows from \\(q\\) in\nclassical logic, then it ought to be included in the defeasible\nconsequences of \\(q\\) as well. A formula \\(q\\) ought to\ncount as an (at least) defeasible consequence of itself, and anything\nincluded in the content of \\(q\\) (any formula \\(p\\) that\nfollows from \\(q\\) in classical logic) ought to count as a\ndefeasible consequence of \\(q\\) as well. Moreover, the defeasible\nconsequences of a set \\(\\Gamma\\) ought to depend only on the content of\nthe formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\), not in how that content is represented.\nConsequently, the defeasible consequence relation ought to treat\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and the classical logical closure of \\(\\Gamma\\) (which we\u2019ll\nrepresent as \u201c\\(Cn(\\Gamma)\\)\u201d) in exactly the same\nway. A consequence relation that satisfies these two conditions is\nsaid to satisfy full absorption (see Makinson 1994, 47).\n\nFull Absorption:\n\\(Cn(C(\\Gamma)) = C(\\Gamma) = C(Cn(\\Gamma))\\)\n\nFinally, a genuinely logical consequence relation ought to enable us\nto reason by cases. So, it should satisfy a principle called\ndistribution: if a formula \\(p\\) follows defeasibly from both\n\\(q\\) and \\(r\\), then it ought to follow from their\ndisjunction. (To require the converse principle would be to reinstate\nmonotonicity.) The relevant principle is this:\n\nDistribution:\n\\(C(\\Gamma) \\cap C(\\Delta) \\subseteq C(Cn(\\Gamma) \\cap Cn(\\Delta))\\).\n\nConsequence relations that are cumulative, strongly absorptive, and\ndistributive satisfy a number of other desirable properties, including\nconditionalization: If a formula \\(p\\) is a defeasible\nconsequence of \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{q\\}\\), then the material\nconditional \\((q \\rightarrow p)\\) is a defeasible consequence\nof \\(\\Gamma\\) alone. In addition, such logics satisfy the property of\nloop: if \\(p_1 \\dproves p_2 \\ldots p_{n-1} \\dproves p_n\\) (where \u201c\n\\(\\dproves\\)\n\u201d represents the defeasible consequence relation), then the\ndefeasible consequences of \\(p_i\\) and\n\\(p_j\\) are exactly the same, for any\n\\(i\\) or\n \\(j\\).[2]\n\nThere are three further conditions that have been much discussed in\nthe literature, but whose status remains controversial:\ndisjunctive rationality, rational monotony, and\nconsistency preservation.\n\n\nDisjunctive Rationality:\nIf \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{p\\} \\notdproves r\\), and \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{q\\}\n\\notdproves r\\), then \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{\\)(p \\(\\vee\\) q)\\(\\} \\notdproves\nr\\).\n\nRational Monotony:\nIf \\(\\Gamma \\dproves A\\), then either \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{B\\} \\dproves A\\)\nor \\(\\Gamma \\dproves \\neg B\\).\n\nConsistency Preservation:\nIf \\(\\Gamma\\) is classically consistent, then so is \\(C(\\Gamma)\\) (the\nset of defeasible consequences of \\(\\Gamma)\\).\n\n\nAll three properties seem desirable, but they set a very hight\nstandard for the defeasible reasoner.\n",
