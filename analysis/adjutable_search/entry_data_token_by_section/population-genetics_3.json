    "main_text": "Population-Genetic Models of Evolution || Selection at One Locus\n3.1 Selection at One Locus\n\nNatural selection occurs when some variants in a population enjoy a\nsurvival or reproductive advantage over others. The simplest\npopulation-genetic model of natural selection focuses on a single\nautosomal locus with two alleles, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), in a large\npopulation. Random mating is assumed. The three diploid genotypes\n\\(A_1 A_1,\\) \\(A_1 A_2\\) and \\(A_2 A_2\\) have different fitnesses,\ndenoted by \\(w_{11},\\) \\(w_{12}\\) and \\(w_{22}\\) respectively. These\nfitnesses are assumed to be constant across generations. A\ngenotype\u2019s fitness may be defined, in this context, as the\naverage number of successful gametes that an organism of that genotype\ncontributes to the next generation\u2014which depends on how well the\norganism survives, how many matings it achieves, and how fertile it\nis. Unless \\(w_{11},\\) \\(w_{12}\\) and \\(w_{22}\\) are all equal, then\nnatural selection will occur, which may lead the genetic composition\nof the population to change.\n\nSuppose that initially, i.e., before selection has operated, the\nzygote genotypes are in Hardy-Weinberg proportions and the frequencies\nof the \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) alleles are \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) respectively,\nwhere \\(p + q = 1\\). The zygotes then grow to adulthood and reproduce,\ngiving rise to a new generation of offspring zygotes. Our task is to\ncompute the frequencies of \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) in the second\ngeneration; let us denote these by \\(p'\\) and \\(q'\\) respectively,\nwhere \\(p' + q' = 1\\). (Note that in both generations, we consider\ngene frequencies at the zygotic stage; these may differ from the adult\ngene frequencies if there is differential survivorship.)\n\nIn the first generation, the genotypic frequencies at the zygotic\nstage are \\(p^2 , 2pq\\) and \\(q^2\\) for \\(A_1 A_1,\\) \\(A_1 A_2,\\)\n\\(A_2 A_2\\) respectively, by the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The three\ngenotypes produce successful gametes in proportion to their fitnesses,\ni.e., in the ratio \\(w_{11}:w_{12}:w_{22}\\).  The average fitness in\nthe population is \\(w = p^2 w_{11} + 2pq w_{12} + q^2\nw_{22}\\). Assuming there is no mutation, and that Mendel\u2019s law\nof segregation holds, then an \\(A_1 A_1\\) organism will produce only\n\\(A_1\\) gametes, an \\(A_2 A_2\\) organism will produce only \\(A_2\\)\ngametes, and an \\(A_1 A_2\\) organism will produce \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\)\ngametes in equal proportion (on average). Therefore, the proportion of\n\\(A_1\\) gametes, and thus the frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele in the\nsecond generation at the zygotic stage, is:\n\n\\[\\tag{1}\n\\begin{align}\np' &= \\frac{p^2 w_{11} + \\frac{1}{2} (2pq w_{12})}{w} \\\\\n&= \\frac{p^2 w_{11} + pq w_{12}}{w}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nEquation (1) is known as a \u2018recurrence\u2019 equation\u2014it\nexpresses the frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele in the\nsecond generation in terms of its frequency in the first generation.\nThe change in frequency between generations can then be written\nas:\n\n\\[\\tag{2}\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta p &= p' - p \\\\\n&= \\frac{p^2 w_{11} + pq w_{12}}{w} - p \\\\\n&=  \\frac{pq[p(w_{11} - w_{12}) + q(w_{12} - w_{22})]}{w}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIf \\(\\Delta p \\gt 0\\), then natural selection has led the\n\\(A_1\\) allele to increase in frequency; if\n\\(\\Delta p \\lt 0\\) then selection has led the\n\\(A_2\\) allele to increase in frequency. If\n\\(\\Delta p = 0\\) then no gene frequency change has occurred,\ni.e., the system is in allelic equilibrium. (Note, however, that the\ncondition \\(\\Delta p = 0\\) does not imply that no\nnatural selection has occurred; the condition for that is\n\\(w_{11} = w_{12} = w_{22}\\). It is possible for natural selection to occur\nbut to have no effect on gene frequencies.)\n\nEquations (1) and (2) show, in precise terms, how fitness differences\nbetween genotypes will lead to evolutionary change. This enables us to\nexplore the consequences of various different selective regimes.\n\nSuppose firstly that \\(w_{11} \\gt w_{12} \\gt w_{22}\\), i.e., the \\(A_1\nA_1\\) homozygote is fitter than the \\(A_1 A_2\\) heterozygote, which in\nturn is fitter than the \\(A_2 A_2\\) homozygote. By inspection of\nequation (2), we can see that \\(\\Delta p\\) must be positive (so long\nas neither \\(p\\) nor \\(q\\) is zero). So in each generation, the\nfrequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele will be greater than in the previous\ngeneration, until it eventually reaches fixation. Once the \\(A_1\\)\nallele reaches fixation, i.e., \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 0\\), no further\nevolutionary change will occur, for if \\(p = 1\\) then \\(\\Delta p =\n0\\).  This makes good sense intuitively: since the \\(A_1\\) allele\nconfers a fitness advantage on organisms that carry it, its relative\nfrequency in the population will increase from generation to\ngeneration until it is fixed.\n\nIt is obvious that analogous reasoning applies in the case where\n\\(w_{22} \\gt w_{12} \\gt w_{11}\\). Equation (2) tells us that \\(\\Delta p\\)\nmust then be negative, so long as neither \\(p\\) nor \\(q\\) is\nzero, so the \\(A_2\\) allele will sweep to fixation.\n\nA more interesting situation arises when the heterozygote is superior\nin fitness to both of the homozygotes, i.e., \\(w_{12} \\gt w_{11}\\) and\n\\(w_{12} \\gt w_{22}\\)\u2014a phenomenon known as heteroygote\nsuperiority. Intuitively it is clear what should happen in this\nsituation: an equilibrium situation should be reached in which both\nalleles are present in the population. Equation (2) confirms this\nintuition. It is easy to see that \\(\\Delta p = 0\\) if either allele\nhas gone to fixation (i.e., if \\(p = 0\\) or \\(q = 0)\\), or, thirdly,\nif the following condition obtains:\n\n\\[\np(w_{11} - w_{12}) + q(w_{12} - w_{22}) = 0\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhich reduces to\n\n\\[\np = p^* = \\frac{(w_{12} - w_{22})}{(w_{12} - w_{22}) + (w_{12} - w_{11})}\n\\]\n\n\n(The asterisk indicates that this is an equilibrium condition.) Since\n\\(p\\) must be non-negative, this condition can only be satisfied\nif there is heterozygote superiority or inferiority; it represents an\nequilibrium state of the population in which both alleles are present.\nThis equilibrium is known as polymorphic, by contrast with\nthe monomorphic equilibria that arise when either of the\nalleles has gone to fixation. The possibility of polymorphic\nequilibrium is quite significant. It teaches us that natural selection\nwill not always lead to homogeneity; in some cases, selection\npreserves the genetic variation found in a population.\n\nNumerous evolutionary questions can be addressed using simple\npopulation-genetic models of this sort. For example, by incorporating\na parameter which measures the fitness differences between genotypes,\nwe can study the rate of evolutionary change, permitting us\nto ask questions such as: how long will it take for selection to\nincrease the frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele from 0.1\nto 0.9? If a given deleterious allele is recessive, how much longer\nwill it take to eliminate it from the population than if it were\ndominant? In this way, population genetics converted the theory of\nevolution into a quantitatively precise one.\n\nThe one-locus model outlined above is unlikely to apply to many\nreal-life populations, due to the simplifying assumptions it makes. In\nreality, selection is rarely the only evolutionary force in operation,\ngenotypic fitnesses are unlikely to be constant across generations,\nMendelian segregation does not always hold exactly, and not all\nevolving populations are large. Much effort in population genetics has\nbeen put into making more realistic models which relax these\nassumptions and are thus more complicated. But the one-locus model\nillustrates the essence of the population-genetic analysis of\nevolutionary change.\n",
