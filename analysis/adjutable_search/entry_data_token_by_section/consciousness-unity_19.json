    "main_text": "Theories of Unity || The Internal Links Theory\n7.3 The Internal Links Theory\n\nNow we turn to the idea that unified consciousness of contents and\nexperiencing requires some kind of phenomenally evident relation among\nthe contents of the unified conscious state (in addition to the\ncontents being aspects of a single unified act of consciousness) and\nsome attempts to model this relationship. We might call this the\nrelational model of unified consciousness. It is a descendant\nof Kant\u2019s claim examined in\n Section 1\n that unified consciousness requires conceptual interconnectedness in\nthe objects of consciousness; as he put it, \n\n\nall appearances stand in a thoroughgoing connection according to\nnecessary laws, and hence stand in a transcendental affinity\nof which the empirical affinity is the mere consequence. (1781/1787:\nA113\u2013114) \n\n\nKant\u2019s argument for this claim seems to have been that synthesis\nof represented objects to produce a single complex object is a\nnecessary condition of consciousness of self as single common subject.\nWithout represented objects being tied together in a single complex\nobject, one might be aware of the subject of an individual\nrepresentation but one could not be aware of the subject of one such\nrepresentation as the subject of other such representations. Rather, I\nshould have \u201cas many-coloured and diverse a self as I have\nrepresentations of which I am conscious ..\u201d. (B134)\u2014as are\nin fact had by me, for I would not, of course, be aware that it was\nme. \n\nOne recent expression of the idea is Hurley\u2019s (1998) claim that\nconscious states must satisfy a normative requirement if unified\nconsciousness is to result. Specifically, they must \u2018cohere\nsemantically\u2019. (It is not entirely clear that satisfying this\nnormative requirement requires that the contents of consciousness be\nlinked in the way that Kant urged.) Even more recently, Revonsuo\n(2003) has urged that phenomenal contents must be situated in the same\n\u2018phenomenal space\u2019 in order to be unified, adding,\n\u201cI am inclined to treat phenomeno-spatiality as the basic\nunifying feature of human consciousness\u201d.\n\nFor theorists of this persuasion, these phenomenally evident spatial,\ncausal, etc., relations among contents explain why my perceptual\nstates typically present one coherent world in which, for instance, a\nwall in front of me and starting at one end of my visual field will\ncontinue across that field. Are such connections among the contents of\nan experience necessary for their being presented together in\nexperience? Some recent theorists have argued that they are not (Bayne\n2004; Brook 2005). One can have unified consciousness of a siren that\nthat one is hearing, an average grade that one is calculating, and a\nfictitious landscape that one is visualizing. In what possible way\ncould items as diverse as these have to be connected to one another?\nThey are not even all in space or contiguous to one another and they\nare certainly not causally interconnected, yet I can experience all\nthree in a single act of unified consciousness. \n\nDoesn\u2019t there have to be at least logical coherence among the\ncontents? As we just saw, Hurley (1998) makes this claim, as does\nBaars (1988). Hurley, for example, argues that we cannot believe\nmutually inconsistent things when we are conscious of both in a single\nunified experience. Could the disconnect among unified conscious\nstates extend to them actually being inconsistent with one another?\nContrary to Hurley and Baars, the evidence suggests that it could.\nSuppose that one sees a stick immersed in water as being bent but\nfeels it to be straight or knows that this is an illusion. Here,\none\u2019s conscious perception that it is bent conflicts with\none\u2019s conscious belief that it is not bent, yet these states are\nunified in one consciousness (Bayne 2000). Tye (2003: 38) does not\nconsider this illusion to be an example of incoherence. He holds that\nhere touch corrects vision, making the stick appear to be straight,\nand so belief renders the appearance mere appearance. That claim is\ncontroversial. Bayne (2004: 227) discusses another example, inverting\nspectacles, more plausibly. These glasses render one\u2019s visual\ncontents inconsistent with one\u2019s tactile contents, yet\nconsciousness of the visual contents remains unified with\nconsciousness of the tactile contents. \n\nIn fact, it would seem that there can be incompatibilities even within\na perceptual modality. Thus, Tye (2003: 38\u201339) notes that there\nare pictures that depict impossible situations. He also discusses the\nwaterfall effect, in which, after staring at a waterfall for some\ntime, if one looks at the adjacent rock face, a portion of the rock\nsurface will appear to be moving\u2014and not moving (relative to the\narea around it; not everyone accepts that both elements are\nsimultaneously present in the waterfall illusion; see Crane 1988).\nThese examples suggest that we can have unified consciousness of\npretty much any collection of items whatsoever, no matter how they are\nrelated to one another. Indeed, it is not easy to specify any relation\namong unified contents or acts of experiencing (beyond their being\nunified) that is required for them to be unified. If so,\nHurley\u2019s (1998) suggestion that meeting a normative requirement\nis necessary for unified consciousness, specifically, a requirement\nthat the experienced properties of things in unified consciousness\ncohere semantically, is in trouble. \n",
