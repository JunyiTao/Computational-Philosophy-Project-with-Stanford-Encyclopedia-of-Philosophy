    "main_text": "Aspects of Illocutionary Force || Conditions of Satisfaction\n3.2 Conditions of Satisfaction\n\n\nOne suggestion might come from the related notion of conditions of\nsatisfaction. This notion generalizes that of truth. As we saw in\n2.3, it is internal to the activity of assertion that it aims to\ncapture how things are. When an assertion does so, not only is it\ntrue, it has hit its target; the aim of the assertion has been met. A\nsimilar point may be made of imperatives: it is internal to the\nactivity of issuing an imperative that the world is enjoined to\nconform to it. The imperative is satisfied just in case it is\nfulfilled. Assertions and imperatives both have conditions of\nsatisfaction\u2014truth in the first place, and conformity in the\nsecond. In addition, it might be held that questions have answerhood\nas their conditions of satisfaction: A question hits its target just\nin case it finds an answer, often in a speech act, such as an\nassertion, that answers the question posed. Like the notion of\ndirection of fit, however, the notion of conditions of satisfaction is\ntoo coarse-grained to enable us to make some valuable distinctions\namong speech acts. Just to use our earlier case again: an assertion\nand a conjecture that P have identical conditions of\nsatisfaction, namely that P be the case. May we discern\nfeatures distinguishing these two speech acts, in a way enabling us to\nmake finer-grained distinctions among other speech acts as well? I\nshall return to this question in Sections 6\u20137.\n",
