    "main_text": "Traditional Definition of Lying\n1. Traditional Definition of Lying\n\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of lying to others. The\ndictionary definition of lying is \u201cto make a false statement\nwith the intention to deceive\u201d (OED 1989) but there are\nnumerous problems with this definition. It is both too narrow, since\nit requires falsity, and too broad, since it allows for lying about\nsomething other than what is being stated, and lying to someone who is\nbelieved to be listening in but who is not being addressed.\n\n\nThe most widely accepted definition of lying is the following:\n\u201cA lie is a statement made by one who does not believe it with\nthe intention that someone else shall be led to believe it\u201d\n(Isenberg 1973, 248) (cf. \u201c[lying is] making a statement believed\nto be false, with the intention of getting another to accept it as\ntrue\u201d (Primoratz 1984, 54n2)). This definition does not specify\nthe addressee, however. It may be restated as follows:\n\n(L1)\nTo lie =df to make a believed-false statement to\nanother person with the intention that the other person believe that\nstatement to be true.\n\n\nL1 is the traditional definition of lying. According to L1, there\nare at least four necessary conditions for lying. First, lying requires\nthat a person make a statement (statement condition). Second, lying\nrequires that the person believe the statement to be false; that is,\nlying requires that the statement be untruthful (untruthfulness\ncondition). Third, lying requires that the untruthful statement be made\nto another person (addressee condition). Fourth, lying requires that\nthe person intend that that other person believe the untruthful\nstatement to be true (intention to deceive the addressee\ncondition).\n\n\nThese four necessary conditions need to be explained before\nobjections to L1 can be entertained and alternative\ndefinitions can be considered.\n",
