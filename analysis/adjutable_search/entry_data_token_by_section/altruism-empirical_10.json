    "main_text": "Beyond Egoism vs. Altruism\n7. The Bottom Line\n\nBatson and his collaborators have accomplished a great deal. They have\nformulated a sophisticated altruist hypothesis, the empathy-altruism\nhypothesis, that can be tested against competing egoist hypotheses,\nand they have designed experiments making a strong case that many of\nthose egoist hypotheses are false. But to show that altruism is true,\nit is not enough to show that specific egoist hypotheses can\u2019t\nexplain specific episodes of helping behavior. Nor would it be enough\nto show that all plausible versions of egoism are false. It must also\nbe shown that episodes of helping behavior that can\u2019t be\nexplained egoistically can\u2019t be explained by another process,\nsuch as principalistic ultimate motivation or ultimate motivation by a\nnon-moral norm. In addition, the defender of altruism must show that\nnon-egoistic episodes of helping behavior are not the product of the\nhabitual or Pavlovian systems. None of Batson\u2019s experiments were\ndesigned to rule out these non-egoistic options or others that might\nbe suggested. So there is still much work to be done. \n\nOn a more positive note, it seems that Batson and his associates have\nshown quite conclusively that the methods of experimental psychology\ncan move the debate forward. Indeed, one might argue that Batson has\nmade more progress in this area during the last four decades than\nphilosophers using the traditional philosophical methodology of a\npriori arguments buttressed by anecdote and intuition have made in the\nprevious two millennia. Their work powerfully demonstrates the utility\nof empirical methods in moral psychology; philosophical moral\npsychologists debating the altruism-egoism question have always made\nempirical claim, and it is now evident that the human sciences possess\nresources to help us empirically assess those empirical claims.\n",
