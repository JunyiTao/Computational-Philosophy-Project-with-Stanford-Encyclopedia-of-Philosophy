    "main_text": "The Classical Republican Tradition || The Instrumental Turn\n3.1 The Instrumental Turn\n\nBeginning with Skinner (1984), Sunstein (1988), and Pettit (1989), an\nalternative interpretation of the tradition began to emerge.\nUndoubtedly, the classical republicans were committed to the\nimportance of active political participation, civic virtue, combating\ncorruption, and so forth. But rather than viewing these as\nintrinsically valuable components of a particular vision of the good\nlife, these authors argued, they should instead be viewed as\ninstrumentally useful tools for securing and preserving\npolitical liberty, understood as independence from arbitrary rule.\nRepublicanism, on this view, has its roots not in an Aristotelian\nvision of the ancient Greek polis, but rather in Roman jurisprudence\nwith its fundamental and categorical distinction between free men and\ncitizens on the one hand, and dependent slaves on the other. This\ninstrumental or \u2018neo-Roman\u2019 interpretation of the\ntradition was cemented in major contributions by Spitz (1995), Pettit\n(1997), Dagger (1997), and Skinner (1998).\n\nThere now exists a considerable historiographical literature advancing\nthis new interpretation, including studies of Machiavelli (Skinner\n1983, 1984; Viroli 1998), the seventeenth-century English republicans\n(Dzelzainis 1995; Skinner 1998, 2000; Lovett 2005, 2012a, 2020);\nRousseau (Viroli 1998); many Americans of the founding era (Sellers\n1994); Wollstonecraft (Coffee 2012; Halldenius 2015); some of the\nFrench revolutionaries (Hammersley (2010);\u00a0and the\nnineteenth-century American labor republicans (Gourevitch 2015). These\nand other contemporary civic republicans argue that a careful reading\nof the classical republican texts firmly rejects the perfectionist\ninterpretation favored by civic humanists.\n\nMoreover, the instrumental turn was vital to establishing interest in\nrepublicanism as a viable contemporary political doctrine. The\ndifficulty with civic humanism, as many critics have pointed out, is\nthat a perfectionist vision of human flourishing through active\npolitical virtue is out of step with modern political and social\nconditions. There is simply no hope for\u00a0recreating the experience\nof the Greek polis in economically complex mass democracies\ncharacterized by reasonable pluralism (Herzog 1986; Goodin 2003;\nBrennan and Lomasky 2006). This objection is removed, however, if we\nregard civic virtue instrumentally, as merely one tool among others\nfor securing political liberty. Insofar as republicans are willing to\nuse that tool, and thus willing to support public policies designed to\ndeliberately cultivate civic virtue, they must perhaps reject stronger\ndoctrines of liberal neutrality; but they will nevertheless be happy\nto endorse broad principles of toleration (Honohan 2013; Lovett and\nWhitfield 2016). Thus properly understood, republicanism is fully\n\u201ccompatible with modern pluralistic forms of society\u201d\n(Pettit 1997, 8).\n",
