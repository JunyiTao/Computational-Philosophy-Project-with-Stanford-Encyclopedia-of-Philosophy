At least some conscious\nstates appear to have the motive force they do intrinsically. In\nparticular, the functional and motivational roles of conscious\naffective states, such as pleasures and pains, seem intrinsic to their\nexperiential character and inseparable from their qualitative and\nphenomenal properties, though the view has been challenged (Nelkin\n1989, Rosenthal 1991). The attractive positive motivational aspect of a\npleasure seems a part of its directly experienced phenomenal feel, as\ndoes the negative affective character of a pain, at least in the case\nof normal non-pathological experience.\n\n\nThere is considerable disagreement about the extent to which the\nfeel and motive force of pain can dissociate in abnormal cases, and\nsome have denied the existence of such intrinsically motivating aspects\naltogether (Dennett 1991). However, at least in the normal case, the\nnegative motivational force of pain seems built right into the\nfeel of the experience itself.\n\n\nJust how this might be so remains less than clear, and\nperhaps the appearance of intrinsic and directly experienced\nmotivational force is illusory. But if it is real, then it may be one\nof the most important and evolutionarily oldest respects in which\nconsciousness makes a difference to the mental systems and processes in\nwhich it is present (Humphreys 1992).\n\n\nOther suggestions have been made about the possible roles and value\nof consciousness, and these six surely do not exhaust the options.\nNonetheless, they are among the most prominent recent hypotheses, and\nthey provide a fair survey of the sorts of answers that have been\noffered to the Why question by those who believe consciousness does\nindeed make a difference.\n",
