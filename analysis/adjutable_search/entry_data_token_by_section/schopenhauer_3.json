    "main_text": "The World as Will\n4. The World as Will\n\nIt is a perennial philosophical reflection that if one looks deeply\nenough into oneself, one will discover not only one\u2019s own\nessence, but also the essence of the universe. For as one is a part of\nthe universe as is everything else, the basic energies of the universe\nflow through oneself as they flow through everything else. For that\nreason it is thought that one can come into contact with the nature of\nthe universe if one comes into substantial contact with one\u2019s\nultimate inner being.\n\nAmong the most frequently-identified principles that are\nintrospectively brought forth \u2013 and one that was the standard\nfor German Idealist philosophers such as Fichte, Schelling and Hegel\nwho were philosophizing within the Cartesian tradition \u2013 is the\nprinciple of self-consciousness. With the belief that acts of\nself-consciousness exemplify a self-creative process akin to divine\ncreation, and developing a logic that reflects the structure of\nself-consciousness, namely, the dialectical logic of position,\nopposition and reconciliation (sometimes described as the logic of\nthesis, antithesis and synthesis), the German Idealists maintained\nthat dialectical logic mirrors the structure not only of human\nproductions, both individual and social, but the structure of reality\nas a whole, conceived of as a thinking substance or\nconceptually-structured-and-constituted being.\n\nAs much as he opposes the traditional German Idealists in their\nmetaphysical elevation of self-consciousness (which he regards as too\nintellectualistic), Schopenhauer philosophizes within the spirit of\nthis tradition, for he believes that the supreme principle of the\nuniverse is likewise apprehensible through introspection, and that we\ncan understand the world as various manifestations of this general\nprinciple. For Schopenhauer, this is not the principle of\nself-consciousness and rationally-infused will, but is rather what he\nsimply calls \u201cWill\u201d \u2013 a mindless, aimless,\nnon-rational impulse at the foundation of our instinctual drives, and\nat the foundational being of everything. Schopenhauer\u2019s\noriginality does not reside in his characterization of the world as\nWill, or as act \u2013 for we encounter this position in\nFichte\u2019s philosophy \u2013 but in the conception of Will as\nbeing devoid of rationality or intellect.\n\nHaving rejected the Kantian position that our sensations are caused by\nan unknowable object that exists independently of us, Schopenhauer\nnotes importantly that our body \u2013 which is just one among the\nmany objects in the world \u2013 is given to us in two different\nways: we perceive our body as a physical object among other physical\nobjects, subject to the natural laws that govern the movements of all\nphysical objects, and we are aware of our body through our immediate\nawareness, as we each consciously inhabit our body, intentionally move\nit, and feel directly our pleasures, pains, and emotional states. We\ncan objectively perceive our hand as an external object, as a surgeon\nmight perceive it during a medical operation, and we can also be\nsubjectively aware of our hand as something we inhabit, as something\nwe move willfully, and of which we can feel its inner muscular\nworkings. \n\nFrom this observation, Schopenhauer asserts that among all the objects\nin the universe, there is only one object, relative to each\nof us \u2013 namely, our physical body \u2013 that is given in two\nentirely different ways. It is given as representation (i.e.,\nobjectively; externally) and as Will (i.e., subjectively; internally).\nOne of his notable conclusions is that when we move our hand, this is\nnot to be comprehended as a motivational act that first happens, and\nthen causes the movement of our hand as an effect. He maintains that\nthe movement of our hand is but a single act \u2013 again, like the\ntwo sides of a coin \u2013 that has a subjective feeling of willing\nas one of its aspects, and the movement of the hand as the other. More\ngenerally, he adds that the action of the body is nothing but the act\nof Will objectified, that is, translated into perception. \n\nAt this point in his argumentation, Schopenhauer has established only\nthat among his many ideas, or representations, only one of them (viz.,\nthe [complex] representation of his body) has this special\ndouble-aspected quality. When he perceives the moon or a mountain, he\ndoes not under ordinary circumstances have any direct access to the\nmetaphysical inside of such objects; they remain as representations\nthat reveal to him only their objective side. Schopenhauer asks,\nthough, how he might understand the world as an integrated whole, or\nhow he might render his entire field of perception the most comprehensible, for as things stand, he can directly experience the\ninside of one of his representations, but of no others. To answer this\nquestion, he uses the double-knowledge of his own body as the key to\nthe inner being of every other natural phenomenon: he regards \u2013\nas if he were trying to make the notion of universal empathy\ntheoretically possible \u2013 every object in the world as being\nmetaphysically double-aspected, and as having an inside or inner\naspect of its own, just as his consciousness is the inner aspect of\nhis own body. This is his rationale for rejecting Descartes\u2019s\ncausal interactionism, where thinking substance is said to cause\nchanges in an independent material substance and vice-versa.\n\nThis precipitates a position that characterizes the inner aspect of\nthings, as far as we can describe it, as Will. Hence, Schopenhauer\nregards the world as a whole as having two sides: the world is Will\nand the world is representation. The world as Will (\u201cfor\nus\u201d, as he sometimes qualifies it) is the world as it is in\nitself, which is a unity, and the world as representation is the world\nof appearances, of our ideas, or of objects, which is a diversity. An\nalternative title for Schopenhauer\u2019s main book, The World as\nWill and Representation, might well have been, The World as\nReality and Appearance. Similarly, his book might have\nbeen entitled, The Inner and Outer Nature of Reality. \n\nAn inspiration for Schopenhauer\u2019s view that ideas are like inert\nobjects is George Berkeley (1685\u20131753), who describes ideas in\nthis deactivated way in his A Treatise Concerning the\nPrinciples of Human Knowledge (1710) [Section 25]. A primary\ninspiration for Schopenhauer\u2019s double-aspect view of the\nuniverse is Baruch (Benedict) de Spinoza (1632\u20131677), who\ndeveloped a similarly-structured metaphysics, and who Schopenhauer had\nstudied in his early years before writing his dissertation. A\nsubsequent, but often highlighted inspiration is from the Upanishads\n(c. 900\u2013600 BCE) which also expresses a double-aspected view of the universe as having objective and subjective aspects, referred to respectively as Brahman and Atman. \n\nOnly a few months after completing his dissertation, Schopenhauer was\nexposed to classical Indian thought in late 1813 by the orientalist\nFriedrich Majer (1771\u20131818), who visited Johanna\nSchopenhauer\u2019s salon in Weimar. Schopenhauer also probably met\nat the time, Julius Klaproth (1783\u20131835), who was the editor of\nDas Asiatische Magazin. As the records of his library book\nwithdrawals indicate, Schopenhauer began reading the Bhagavadgita in\nDecember 1813 or very soon thereafter, and the Upanishads in March\n1814, coincident with the time when Schopenhauer\u2019s thought\nassumed an explicitly atheistic quality. Only a year before this, he\nwas referring to himself explicitly in his notebooks as an\n\u201cilluminated theist,\u201d i.e., a mystic, in an 1812\ndiscussion of Schelling\u2019s philosophy (Manuscript\nRemains, Vol. 2, p. 373).\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s appreciation for Indian thought was augmented in\nDresden during the writing of The World as Will and\nRepresentation by his 1815\u20131817 neighbor Karl Friedrich Christian Krause.  Not only was Krause a metaphysical panentheist (see biographic segment above), he was also\nan enthusiast of South Asian thought. Familiar with the Sanskrit\nlanguage, he introduced Schopenhauer to publications on India in the\nAsiatisches Magazin, and these enhanced Schopenhauer\u2019s\nstudies of the first European-language translation of the Upanishads:\nin 1801, a Persian version of the Upanishads (the Oupnekhat) was\nrendered into Latin by the French Orientalist, Abraham Hyacinthe\nAnquetil-Duperron (1731-1805) \u2013 a scholar who also introduced\ntranslations of Zoroastrian texts into Europe in 1771. \n\nDespite its general precedents within the philosophical family of\ndouble-aspect theories, Schopenhauer\u2019s particular\ncharacterization of the world as Will is nonetheless novel and daring.\nIt is also frightening and pandemonic: he maintains that the world as\nit is in itself (again, sometimes adding \u201cfor us\u201d) is an\nendless striving and blind impulse with no end in view, devoid of\nknowledge, lawless, absolutely free, entirely self-determining and\nalmighty. Within Schopenhauer\u2019s vision of the world as Will,\nthere is no God to be comprehended, and the world is conceived of as\nbeing inherently meaningless. When anthropomorphically considered, the\nworld is represented as being in a condition of eternal frustration,\nas it endlessly strives for nothing in particular, and as it goes\nessentially nowhere. It is a world beyond any ascriptions of good and\nevil.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s denial of meaning to the world differs radically\nfrom the views of Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, all of whom sustained a\ndistinct belief that everything is moving towards a harmonious and just\nend. Like these German Idealists, however, Schopenhauer explained how the world that we experience daily is the result of the\nactivity of the central principle of things. Just as the German Idealists accounted for the great chain of being \u2013 the rocks,\ntrees, animals, and human beings \u2013 as the increasingly\ncomplicated and detailed objectifications of self-consciousness,\nSchopenhauer explained the world as\nobjectifications of Will. \n\nFor Schopenhauer, the world we experience is constituted by\nobjectifications of Will that correspond first, to the general root of\nthe principle of sufficient reason, and second, to the more specific\nfourfold root of the principle of sufficient reason. This generates a two-tiered outlook (viz., Will [= reality] vs.\nobjects-in-general [= appearance]), that articulates into a\nthree-tiered outlook (viz., Will [= reality] vs. universal,\nnon-spatio-temporal objects vs. individual, spatio-temporal objects),\nby further distinguishing between universalistic and individualistic\nlevels within the sphere of objects. \n\nThe general philosophical pattern of a single world-essence that\ninitially manifests itself as a multiplicity of abstract essences,\nthat, in turn, manifest themselves as a multiplicity of physical\nindividuals is found throughout the world. It is characteristic of\nNeoplatonism (c. third century, C.E., as represented by Plotinus\n[204\u2013270]), as well as the Buddhist Three Body Doctrine\n[trikaya] of the Buddha\u2019s manifestation, that is\ndeveloped in the Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism as represented\nby Maitreya (270\u2013350), Asanga (375\u2013430) and Vasubandu\n(400\u2013480).\n\nAccording to Schopenhauer, corresponding to the level of the universal\nsubject-object distinction, Will is immediately objectified into a set\nof universal objects or Platonic Ideas. These constitute the timeless\npatterns for each of the individual things that we experience in space\nand time. There are different Platonic Ideas, and although this\nmultiplicity of Ideas implies that some measure of individuation is\npresent within this realm, each Idea nonetheless contains no plurality\nwithin itself and is said to be \u201cone.\u201d Since the Platonic\nIdeas are in neither space nor time, they lack the qualities of\nindividuation that would follow from the introduction of spatial and\ntemporal qualifications. In these respects, the Platonic Ideas are\nindependent of the specific fourfold root of the principle of\nsufficient reason, even though it would be misleading to say that\nthere is no individuation whatsoever at this universal level, for\nthere are many different Platonic Ideas. Schopenhauer refers to the Platonic Ideas as the direct\nobjectifications of Will and as the immediate objectivity of\nWill.\n\nWill\u2019s indirect objectifications appear when our minds continue\nto apply the principle of sufficient reason beyond its general root\nsuch as to introduce the forms of time, space and causality, not to\nmention logic, mathematics, geometry and moral reasoning. When Will is\nobjectified at this level of determination, the world of everyday life\nemerges, whose objects are, in effect, kaleidoscopically multiplied\nmanifestations of the Platonic forms, endlessly dispersed throughout\nspace and time. \n\nSince the principle of sufficient reason is \u2013 given\nSchopenhauer\u2019s inspiration from Kant \u2013 the epistemological\nform of the human mind, the spatio-temporal world is the world of our\nown reflection. To that extent, Schopenhauer says that life is like a\ndream. As a condition of our knowledge, Schopenhauer believes that the\nlaws of nature, along with the sets of objects that we experience, we\nourselves create in way that is not unlike the way the constitution of\nour tongues invokes the taste of sugar. As Galileo Galilei\n(1564\u20131642) states in \u201cThe Assayer\u201d (1623), if ears\ntongues and noses were removed from the world, then odors, tastes, and\nsounds would be removed as well.\n\nAt this point, what Schopenhauer has developed philosophically is\nsurely interesting, but we have not yet mentioned its more remarkable\nand memorable aspect. If we combine his claim that the world is Will\nwith his Kantian view that we are responsible for the individuated\nworld of appearances, we arrive at a novel outlook \u2013 an outlook\nthat depends heavily upon Schopenhauer\u2019s characterization of the\nthing-in-itself as Will, understood to be an aimless, blind\nstriving.\n\nBefore the human being comes onto the scene with its principle of\nsufficient reason (or principle of individuation) there are no\nindividuals. It is the human being that, in its very effort to know\nanything, objectifies an appearance for itself that involves the\nfragmentation of Will and its breakup into a comprehensible set of\nindividuals. The result of this fragmentation, given the nature of\nWill, is terrible: it is a world of constant struggle, where each\nindividual thing strives against every other individual thing. The\nresult is a permanent \u201cwar of all against all\u201d akin to\nwhat Thomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679) characterized as the state of\nnature. \n\nKant maintains in the Critique of Pure Reason that we create\nthe laws of nature (CPR, A125). Adding to this, Schopenhauer\nmaintains in The World as Will and Representation that we\ncreate the violent state of nature, for his view is that the\nindividuation we impose upon things, is imposed upon a blind striving\nenergy that, once it becomes individuated and objectified, turns\nagainst itself, consumes itself, and does violence to itself. His\nparadigm image is of the bulldog-ant of Australia, that when cut in\nhalf, struggles in a battle to the death between its head and tail.\nOur very quest for scientific and practical knowledge creates \u2013\nfor Schopenhauer sinfully and repulsively \u2013 a world that feasts\nnightmarishly upon itself.\n\nThis marks the origin of Schopenhauer\u2019s renowned pessimism: he\nclaims that as individuals, we are the anguished products of our own\nepistemological making, and that within the world of appearances that\nwe structure, we are fated to fight with other individuals, and to\nwant more than we can ever have. On Schopenhauer\u2019s view, the\nworld of daily life is essentially violent and frustrating; it is a\nworld that, as long as our consciousness remains at that level where\nthe principle of sufficient reason applies in its fourfold root, will\nnever resolve itself into a condition of greater tranquillity. As he\nexplicitly states, daily life \u201cis suffering\u201d\n(WWR, Section 56) and to express this, he employs images of\nfrustration taken from classical Greek mythology, such as those of\nTantalus and the Danaids, along with the suffering of Ixion on the\never-spinning wheel of fire. The image of Sisyphus expresses the same\nfrustrated spirit.\n",
