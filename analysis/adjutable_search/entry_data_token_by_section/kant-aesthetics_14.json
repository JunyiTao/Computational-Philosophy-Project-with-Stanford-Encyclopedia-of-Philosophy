    "main_text": "Teleology || Organisms as Natural Purposes\n3.3 Organisms as Natural Purposes\n\nIn \u00a7\u00a764\u201365 of the Analytic of Teleological Judgment,\nKant introduces the notion of a \u201cnatural purpose\u201d or\n\u201cnatural end\u201d [Naturzweck] and argues both that\n\u201corganized beings\u201d, that is, plants and animals,\ninstantiate the concept of a natural purpose and also that they are\nthe only beings in nature that do so (\u00a765, 376). (Kant sometimes\nsays that they are natural purposes, and sometimes only that they must\nbe \u201cregarded\u201d or \u201cconsidered\u201d as natural\npurposes.) Organized beings (or, to use the more modern term,\n\u201corganisms\u201d) are, or must be considered as, purposes\nbecause we can conceive of their possibility only on the assumption\nthat they were produced in accordance with design. They thus meet the\ndefinition of \u201cpurpose\u201d given at \u00a710. (In the terms\nintroduced in\n Section 3.1,\n they display \u201cinner objective material purposiveness\u201d.)\nBut they are, or must be considered, as products of nature rather than\nproducts of conscious design.\n\nWhat makes an organism qualify as a natural purpose is that it is\n\u201cboth cause and effect of itself\u201d (\u00a764, 371). Kant\ngives a preliminary explanation of this idea at \u00a764 by calling\nattention to three respects in which an organism, such as a tree,\nstands in a causal relation to its own existence. First, in producing\noffspring which resemble it, a tree \u201cproduces itself as far as\nits species is concerned\u201d, so that the species of the tree\nmaintains itself in existence. Second, a tree preserves itself as an\nindividual by taking in nourishment from outside and converting it\ninto the kind of organic substance of which it, itself, is made.\nThird, and most important, the various parts of a tree mutually\nmaintain one another in existence and hence maintain the whole tree in\nexistence. For example, while the leaves are produced by the tree as a\nwhole and depend on it for their growth and maintenance, they are in\nturn necessary for the growth and maintenance of the other parts of\nthe tree, for example the trunk and roots. Kant also mentions a number\nof further phenomena illustrating the way in which an organism is\n\u201ccause and effect\u201d of itself, in particular the capacity\nof certain organisms to regenerate missing parts, and more generally\nthe capacity of organisms to repair damage to themselves.\n\nKant goes into more detail about the notion of a natural purpose in\n\u00a765, where he specifies two conditions something must meet in\norder to be a natural purpose. The first, that the \u201cparts are\npossible\u2026only through their relation to the whole\u201d\n(\u00a765, 373), is a condition on something\u2019s being, not only a\nnatural purpose, but a purpose tout court. It thus applies\nnot only to living things but also to artifacts, such as watches, in\nwhich each part is there for the sake of its relation to the whole,\nand is thus in a sense there only on account of its relation to the\nwhole. The second condition, which applies only to purposes which are\nnatural, is that \u201cthe parts of the thing\u2026are reciprocally\ncause and effect of their form\u201d (ibid.). (This corresponds to\nthe third of the features to which Kant drew our attention in the\nexample of the tree at \u00a764.) This condition is not met by\nartifacts, a point which Kant illustrates by appeal to the example of\na watch, whose parts, unlike the parts of a plant or animal, do not\nproduce one another or maintain one another in existence.\n\nKant is concerned, then, to emphasize both an analogy and a disanalogy\nbetween organisms and artifacts. As in the case of artifacts, we can\nmake sense of organisms (that is, understand their structure and\nworkings) only by appeal to teleological notions. We make sense of an\norganism by coming to understand what the functions of its various\nparts are (e.g., by coming to understand that the function of the\nheart is to pump blood round the body, or that the heart is there\n\u201cin order to\u201d pump blood round the body) just as we make\nsense of an artifact such as a watch by coming to understand the\nfunctions of its parts (e.g., that a particular wheel is\nthere in order to turn the hour hand). But organisms are unlike\nartifacts in that they are not produced or maintained by an external\ncause, but instead have the self-producing and self-maintaining\ncharacter that is revealed in the kinds of vital properties\n(reproduction of young, capacity to nourish themselves, reciprocal\ndependence of parts, capacity for self-repair) which Kant illustrates\nwith the example of the tree.\n\nThe question of how the natural character of organisms can be\nreconciled with their status as purposes, and hence of the very\ncoherence of the notion of a \u201cnatural purpose\u201d, is\nindirectly addressed by Kant in the Dialectic of Teleological Judgment\nin the form of a question about how we are to reconcile the apparently\nconflicting demands of mechanistic and teleological explanation with\nregard to living things (see\n Section 3.4\n below). But it can also be raised in a more direct form. How is it\npossible to regard one and the same object both as a purpose (hence as\nsomething which has been produced as a result of conscious design),\nand as natural (hence\u2014on the face of it\u2014something which\nhas not been produced as a result of conscious design)? To say that we\nregard it only as if it were designed does not on its own\ndispose of the question, for it is not clear what it is to regard\nsomething that is not designed \u201cas if\u201d it were designed:\nif we are not ascribing to organisms the property of being artifacts,\nthen in what respect can we coherently regard them as similar to\nartifacts?\n\nGinsborg (2001) attempts to resolve the problem of coherence by appeal\nto a conception of purposiveness as normativity (see\n Section 3.1\n above), arguing that organisms can be regarded as subject to\nnormative standards without supposing that they were designed to\naccord with those standards. Alternative solutions are offered by\nKreines (2005), who agrees that the notion of a purpose has normative\ncontent but denies that organisms for Kant are in fact purposes, and\nby Beisbart (2009), who argues that the appeal to normativity is\nunnecessary for making sense of organisms as natural purposes, since\nwe can conceive of a natural object as artefact-like by conceiving of\nits parts as produced reciprocally by one another and by the whole (in\nthe way illustrated by Kant through the example of the tree at\n\u00a764). Gambarotto (2018: 14\u201322) addresses the problem by\ndenying that Kant\u2019s notion of a natural purpose is coherent;\nKant, according to Gambarotto, holds an \u201cunstable\u201d view,\nbecause he was unable to free the notion of teleology from that of\nintention.\n\nWhile much discussion of Kant\u2019s biological teleology has\nfocussed on the Dialectic of Teleological Judgment, rather than the\nAnalytic, there is an excellent discussion of the Analytic of\nTeleological Judgment in McLaughlin (1990: ch. 1), which sets\nKant\u2019s view of organisms in the context of eighteenth-century\nbiology. Huneman 2007 is a useful collection of articles which also\nset Kant\u2019s views on organisms in historical context. Other\ndiscussions of the Analytic\u2019s treatment of organisms as natural\npurposes include Zumbach (1984), Illetterati (2014), \u0160ustar\n(2014), and Goy (2014b). Fricke (1990), Guyer (2003b), and Steigerwald\n(2006) relate Kant\u2019s view of organisms as natural purposes to\nhis views about reflective judgment more generally. Breitenbach (2014)\nargues that the ascription of purposiveness to organisms is a matter\nof our regarding organic natural processes as analogous to\nreason\u2019s intentional activity. An interesting question is raised\nby the fact that Kant\u2019s conception of an organism appears to\ncome apart from the idea of a living thing, since Kant describes\n\u201clife\u201d as belonging only to beings with desires. Does\nKant, then, not count plants as living things? Nunez (2021) addresses\nthis question by suggesting that, in a sense, plants have desires even\nthough they are not conscious.\n\nGuyer (2001a) discusses the apparent threat posed by organisms to\nKant\u2019s conception of natural science as unified; a similar\nproblem is raised in Zammito (2012: 123). Breitenbach (2017) argues\nthat the threat is illusory, since the laws under which we unify\nnature include teleological principles.\n\nWhile Kant\u2019s account of organisms as natural purposes is often\ndiscussed in the context of Kant\u2019s account of natural science or\nof eighteenth-century biology, some commentators explore its\nimplications for Kant\u2019s moral teleology and views on rational\nfreedom; see for example N. Fisher (2019) and Ostaric (2021).\n",
