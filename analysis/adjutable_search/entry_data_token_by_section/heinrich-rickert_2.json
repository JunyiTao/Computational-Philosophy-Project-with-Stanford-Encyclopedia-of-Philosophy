    "main_text": "Theory of Science\n3. Theory of Science\n\nEmpirical reality becomes nature when we conceive it with\nreference to the general. It becomes history when we conceive it with\nreference to the distinctive and the individual.\n(Rickert 1986, 54)\n\n\nRickert\u2019s theory of science is primarily geared towards a\nphilosophical elucidation of the natural and the historical sciences.\nThis is intended to provide a defense of the sui generis\nscientificity of the historical sciences against the threat of\npositivism and naturalism. Rickert\u2019s work on this issue builds\nupon Windelband\u2019s influential paper History and Natural\nScience (Windelband 1980, 169\u2013185). While Rickert criticizes some\nterminological and argumentative limits of his teacher\u2019s essay,\nthe bulk of his lengthy volume, The Limits of Concept Formation in\nNatural Science: An Introduction to the Historical Sciences\n(Rickert 1986), is consistent with the tenets of Windelband\u2019s\nposition.\n\n\nWindelband pointed out that the customary distinction of the\nempirical sciences into natural sciences and\nGeisteswissenschaften (that is, literally spiritual or mental\nsciences and used in German to indicate the humanities and the social\nsciences) is deeply misleading (Windelband 1980, 173). This is because\nit seems to suggest that these two groups of sciences differ primarily\nwith respect to their subject matter, that is, in the first case\n\u2018nature\u2019 and in the second case \u2018mind\u2019.\nHowever, there are at least two problems with this classification: (1)\na significant number of disciplines commonly considered\nGeisteswissenschaften have little or nothing to do with the\nstudy of the human mind. Take, for instance, art history, political\neconomics or archeology. None of these disciplines seems to have mental\nprocesses and states as their subject matter. (2) According to this\nclassification psychology should be considered a\nGeisteswissenschaft and presumably even the most fundamental\nof all Geisteswissenschaften in that it studies the human mind\nin the most direct and rigorous fashion. Indeed, in late nineteenth\ncentury Germany there was a widely spread expectation that progress in\npsychology should have led to significant reforms in all other\nhumanistic fields of research. This expectation, however, clashes with\nthe fact that psychology\u2019s method is much more similar to that of\nphysics, chemistry, and biology than with that of literary studies or\nmusicology. Psychology, too, seeks to determine its subject matter in\nterms of general laws and works with the aid of mathematical\nmodels and experiments. Considering these anomalies Windelband\u2019s\nproposal is to drop content-related distinctions altogether and rely\nexclusively on a methodological distinction between\n\u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cidiographic\u201d sciences\n(Windelband 1980, 175). One group of sciences works by way of positing\ngeneral laws and understanding its objects as examples of such general\nlaws (nomo-thetic). Another group of sciences aims at producing\nilluminating descriptions of irreducibly individual and unrepeatable\noccurrences (idiographic). Most importantly, \u201cthe same subjects\ncan be the object of both a nomothetic and an idiographic\ninvestigation\u201d (Windelband 1980, 175). From this purely\nmethodological point of view, sciences like psychology, physics,\nchemistry, and biology all belong in the same group as nomothetic,\nwhereas sciences like history, art history, and musicology are to be\nconsidered idiographic. This distinction is meant to reorganize the\nuniverse of knowledge and to avoid unhelpful encroachments of empirical\npsychology on the work of humanistic disciplines, whose theoretical\naims are fundamentally alien to nomothetic inquiry.\n\n\nRickert enhances and corrects Windelband\u2019s perspective in two\nways: (1) He revises his terminology and rejects the phrase\n\u2018idiographic\u2019, which seems to suggest a purely pictorial or\nreproductive procedure. This would not qualify as knowledge by\nRickert\u2019s epistemological standards (see Zijderveld 2006,\n246\u2013255; Ferrari 1998). (2) He insists on the necessity of\nbeginning a reflection on the classification of the sciences with\na purely methodological criterion, but only to articulate subsequently a\nmore adequate content-related distinction to replace the customary\nNaturwissenschaft/Geisteswissenschaft pair (Rickert 1962,\n11).\n\n\nRickert defines the task of a logical/methodological investigation\nof the sciences in the following terms: \u201cThe logical\ndistinctiveness of an empirical science is to be understood in terms of\nthe relationship the content of its concepts bears to empirical reality\nin its unique and distinctive form\u201d (Rickert 1986, 114). In\nother words, the task of a theory of science is to determine how the\nscience under scrutiny forms its concepts and in so doing\novercomes the unsurveyable, \u201cimmeasurable manifold\u201d\n(Rickert 1962, 32) of empirical reality as it is given in intuition.\nConcept formation for Rickert indicates \u201cthe conclusion of an\ninvestigation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 27), that is the fulfillment of the\nscientific task posed at the beginning of that investigation. In\nkeeping with his general rejection of a pictorial theory of knowledge\n(see above), Rickert rejects the view that the empirical sciences would\nsimply have to depict (abbilden) reality as it is in itself.\nRather, the task of the empirical sciences is to re-mold\n(umbilden) immediately given reality and form\nconcepts, in which only a small fraction of the original given\nis taken up. The criteria for such selections and re-molding activities\nculminating in the formation of a scientific concept are the\nspecific preoccupation of the philosophy of science.\n\n\nAs for the natural sciences, Rickert contends that Kant already\nprovided a satisfactory definition of their logical structure. In the\nProlegomena Kant stated: \u201cNature is the\nexistence of things, insofar as [sofern] that\nexistence is determined according to universal laws\u201d (Kant 2002,\n89; Rickert 1962, 5). Following Kant, Rickert defines the natural\nsciences as generalizing (Rickert 1986, 34; Rickert 1962, 46),\nthat is, they form their concepts by way of moving away from\nthe individual, unrepeatable occurrences encountered in experience. As\nWindelband already saw, the natural sciences view individual\noccurrences as mere examples of general laws. In this way,\nindividuality \u201cfixes the limits of natural scientific\nconcept formation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 40) and calls forth its logical\ncomplement: \u201cindividualizing concept-formation\u201d\n(Rickert 1986, 62) as the method defining the historical sciences. The\nlogical distinction between the sciences, then, has to be between the\ngeneralizing natural sciences and the individualizing historical\nsciences. In other words, while the natural sciences build their\nconcepts by way of disregarding what is individual, the historical\nsciences build their concepts in order to grasp precisely what is\nindividual.\n\n\nHow are we to understand, then, historical individuality?\nRickert\u2019s definition unfolds in three stages (Rickert 1986, 98).\n(1) In the broadest sense, the individual is every single empirical\nreality in its uniqueness and distinctiveness. This, however, is not\nyet historically relevant individuality. (2) In a more\nspecific and etymological sense, a historical individual is what\n\u201cshould not be divided\u201d (Rickert 1986, 85), that is, it is\nan individual whose \u201cuniqueness is related to a value\u201d\n(Rickert 1986, 84). Rickert suggests to compare a lump of coal and the\nfamous Koh-i-noor diamond. While the lump of coal can be split at any\ntime without any significant loss, the Koh-i-noor ought not be\nspilt because it is a good, that is, a bit of reality related\nto a value and valued by any subject capable of carrying out\nvaluations. (3) The historical individual as the object of the\nhistorical sciences has to be a good related to generally\nacknowledged values as opposed to merely personal values. In other\nwords, while a certain item can be valuable to me as an individual (for\ninstance, because a beloved person gave it to me), this is not enough\nto make it an object of historical interest. The Koh-i-noor, on the\ncontrary, has a more than merely individual historical relevance\nbecause it is inextricably related to the historical vicissitudes of\nIndia and British colonialism.\n\n\nThe notions of value and value-relatedness are\ncrucial to determine Rickert\u2019s material or\ncontent-related (inhaltlich) criterion for the demarcation of\nthe sciences. In this respect we have to distinguish between the\nvalue-free sphere of nature and the value-related sphere of\nculture (Rickert 1962, 21). Accordingly, the material\ndistinction that has to replace the customary distinction between\nnatural sciences and Geisteswissenschaften is the distinction\nbetween the sciences of nature (value-free objects) and the sciences of\nculture (value-related objects). It is the reference to objectively\nacknowledged cultural values that \u2018preserves\u2019 the\nindividuality of empirical objects and makes them relevant to\nhistorical inquiry.\n\n\nIn the context of this distinction Rickert insists on the important\ndistinction between Wertung, or valuation, and\nWertbeziehung, or the act of relating something to a value.\nThe two notions stand in sharp opposition. While human subjects in\ntheir practical lives constantly engage in valuations resulting in\npositive or negative value-judgments, the historical scientist must\nabstain from every act of valuation and limit herself to the\nascertainment of objective value-relations in the cultural materials\nunder scrutiny. \u201cAccordingly, if it is to express the character\nof history as a theoretical science, the procedure that we speak of as\noriented to values is to be most sharply separated from one\nthat posits values. This means that history treats values only\nin so far as they are actually accepted by subjects so that\ncertain objects are actually denoted as goods. Thus, even if\nhistory deals with values, it is not a science that posits\nvalues\u201d (Rickert 1962, 89). Rickert gives the following example\nto illustrate this distinction: \u201cWe can regard the personality of\nLuther as either a good thing or a bad thing. In other words, we can\nbelieve that it was a stroke of luck for the cultural development of\nGermany or that it brought misfortune. On this point, the opinions of\nhistorians will probably always be in disagreement. But no one who\nknows the facts will doubt that Luther had some sort of\nsignificance with reference to generally acknowledged values,\nand it can never occur to a historian to claim that Luther\u2019s\npersonality is historically unimportant\u201d (Rickert 1986,\n93; for a critical response to this view see Oakes 1988, 111\u2013144).\n\n\nBy contrasting the generalizing method of the natural sciences dealing\nwith value-free objects and the individualizing (i.e., historical)\nmethod of the cultural sciences dealing with value-related objects,\nRickert does not mean to say that values play no role in the natural\nsciences or that generalizing procedures and general objects are\ncompletely absent form the cultural sciences. On the contrary, he\nemphasizes that \u201cnatural science is not free of\nvaluations\u201d (Rickert 1986, 93). In a way that anticipates much\nlate twentieth century philosophy of science (see for instance Laudan\n1985; Lacey 1999; Allchin 1999) Rickert insists that natural science\nand, for that matter, science in general obeys \u201clogical values\nto which the investigator is committed, and which are implicitly\npresupposed in all scientific concept formation\u201d (Rickert 1986,\n94). What remains \u2018value-free\u2019 is the material that the\nnatural sciences investigate. To stay with the above example, for a\nmineralogist studying diamonds the Koh-i-noor will be merely an\ninstance of some general law of crystallization as much as any other\ndiamond. It is not considered in its relation to culturally\nacknowledged values. On the other hand, the historical sciences do not\ncompletely dispense with elements of generality. Rickert identifies\nfour senses in which \u2018the general\u2019 is at play in\nhistorical research.  \u201cFirst, the elements of all scientific\nconcepts are general\u201d (Rickert 1986, 115). This means that, for\nexample, in order to form the concept \u2018French Revolution\u2019\nwe have to use general concepts such as \u2018French\u2019 and\n\u2018revolution\u2019. However, these two general concepts are\ncompounded in order to capture a unique historical event. In a second\nsense, as we saw, history has to take into account the relation of\nevents and objects to general values. However, the fact that\na certain object has a reference to a general value (e.g. the French\nRevolution bears a reference to the general value \u2018political\nfreedom\u2019) does not make the concept of that object general.\n\u201cThird, historical science never regards individuals in\nisolation, as the generalizing sciences do, but in a general\nnexus\u201d (Rickert 1986, 115). We cannot understand the\nindividual Robespierre unless we view his actions in the meaningful\ngeneral context of the French Revolution. Such \u2018nexus\u2019,\nhowever, is not itself a general concept but is itself an\n\u2018individual\u2019, that is, a unique and unrepeatable\nconstellation of events. Fourth, in some cases the historical\nscientist will deliberately study groups of individuals, say,\nlate-medieval serfs in Holland. In this case single individuals\n(either people or objects) will be seen as mere examples of dynamics\nand characteristics pertaining to their group in a way that seems to\nresemble the generalizing procedure of natural science.  However, even\nin this case the historian is not interested in the \u2018general\nnature\u2019 of human groups but in the individuality of the group at\nissue.\n\n\nRickert engaged in a lifelong controversy with another prominent\ntheorist of the human sciences, Wilhelm Dilthey (on the controversy see\nMakkreel/Luft 2010 and Makkreel 2010). Dilthey advocated the necessity\nto maintain a primarily content-related distinction to demarcate\ndifferent ambits of science and he defended the legitimacy of the\nphrase Geisteswissenschaft. Dilthey rejected the argument that\npsychology could not be foundational for the human sciences because of\nits methodological similarity to the natural sciences. He considered\nthe empirical (or, in his language, explanative) psychology of his time\nto be deeply flawed in that it imitated the methods of the natural\nsciences without paying attention to the specificity of the mental\ndomain (Dilthey 2010, 119). Psychology, for Dilthey, should be\nconducted in a descriptive-analytical spirit, starting off from the\noverall meaningfulness and intelligibility of mental phenomena and\nworking to describe the intricate connections or nexuses of\nsignificance characterizing human life (Dilthey 2010, 182). \u201cSuch\na psychology will become the foundation of the human sciences, just as\nmathematics grounds the natural sciences\u201d (Dilthey 2010, 165).\nThis is because, for Dilthey, all the products of culture studied by\nthe human sciences are nothing but \u201cpsychic life that has become\nobjective, [\u2026] the products of active forces of a psychic nature\nand stable configurations formed from psychic elements and their\nlaws\u201d (Dilthey 2010, 171). For this reason, Dilthey contends that\nin the human sciences we can only understand, as opposed to\nexplain, (Dilthey 2010, 119) cultural products (poems,\nartworks, juridical systems, etc.) to the extent that we\nreactivate the psychic life at their origin and\nrelive (nacherleben) the life-experience that brought\nthem about. If we had theoretical tools provided by a descriptive\npsychology to orient ourselves in the complexity of psychic\nobjectifications, we would make significant advancements in the human\nsciences, too.\n\n\nRickert is willing to grant the \u201cparamount significance of\nmental beings within the historical material\u201d (Rickert 1986, 123)\nand the importance of \u201chistorical personalities that\nvaluate\u201d (Rickert 1986, 122) for the cultural sciences. He is\nalso open to the use of Geist, provided that this term is\nconsidered synonymous with culture. However, he insists that\nDilthey\u2019s emphasis on psychic life and reliving is both\nsystematically and methodologically misleading. First, not all\nof psychic life is relevant in the cultural sciences. Most psychic\nmanifestations, both those occurring in individuals and those\nobjectified in cultural objects, are completely devoid of historical\nsignificance, in that they lack the reference to a general value.\nSecond, even if we had the capacity to relive past experiences in their\ntotal intensity and vividness, this would not amount to\nunderstanding those experiences and their cultural\nobjectifications. In the historical sciences, too, to know does not\nmean merely to mirror or depict a real object. Only if the notion of\nvalue and the objective value-relatedness of historical\nindividuals (be they physical or psychic) are taken as the\nsystematic point of departure can the subjectivity involved in history\nbe adequately understood. \u201cThe fact that history is a science of\nmental entities does not determine its logical structure, for mental\nprocesses can also be represented in a natural scientific or\ngeneralizing fashion. Rather, the converse is true: On the basis of the\nlogical structure of historical science [\u2026] it can be understood\nwhy history primarily takes a certain kind of mental life as the object\nof its investigation\u201d (Rickert 1986, 127).\n\n\nRickert\u2019s theory of generalizing and individualizing concept\nformation as the systematically fundamental criterion for the\ndemarcation of science elicited other waves of criticism. Husserl, for\nexample, considered it an oversimplification of the Kantian problem of\nthe transcendental deduction in that Rickert simply takes for granted\nthat the infinite, unsurveyable manifold of immediate experience is\namenable to conceptualization (Husserl 2001, 91). However, given his\npremises it is hard to see why a completely chaotic and heterogeneous\nimmediate experience would nonetheless lend itself to conceptual\nrationalization. The problem, according to Husserl, is that for Rickert\n\u201cworld-experience (Welterfahrung) remains an empty\nword\u201d (Husserl 2001, 100). Moreover, and similarly to Dilthey,\nHusserl laments the fact that Rickert downplays historically active\nsubjectivity as the source of culture. Like Rickert, Husserl\ndistinguishes between nature and culture in terms of \u201cthe world\nconsidered without significance\u201d as opposed to \u201cthe world\nfull of significance\u201d (Husserl 2002, 139), however, he\nimmediately relates back such significance to the operations of\n\u201cmeaning-bestowing subjectivity, which endows things with\nspiritual meaning [vergeistigen] through operations of\nsignificance [Bedeutungsleistungen]\u201d (Husserl 2002,\n140). For this reason, Husserl considers the whole dispute about\nwhether the correct pair of concepts to demarcate the ambits of science\nshould be nature/Geist (Dilthey) or nature/culture (Rickert)\n\u201ca mere verbal dispute\u201d (Husserl 2002, 140). Another line\nof criticism of Rickert\u2019s distinction comes from his student,\nEmil Lask. In his personal notes Lask forcefully asserts that \u201ca\npurely logical meaning of nature must be absolutely denied\u201d (Lask\n1924, 272). Lask argues that in Rickert\u2019s reconstruction\nnatural-scientific generalization and historical individualization are\ntreated as equally legitimate and complementary ways of conceptualizing\nempirical reality. Against this view Lask contends that the\ngeneralizations carried out by the natural sciences presuppose a\npreliminary \u2018devitalization\u2019 (Ert\u00f6tung) and\n\u2018quantification\u2019 of reality, in which the dimension of\nsignificance and value is put out of play (Lask 1924, 244). In a way\nthat anticipates Husserl\u2019s later treatment of this issue in\nThe Crisis of the European Sciences (Husserl 1970). Lask points\nout that our original experience of the world is pervaded with value\nand significance and it is only by way of an abstractive impoverishment\nof this original experience that the natural sciences create their\nvalue-free (and to that extent artificial) field of research. As a\nmatter of fact, however, there is evidence that Rickert was well aware\nof the quantifying tendency of natural science (see for instance\nRickert 1900, 76), although he did not assign to it a central role.\n",
