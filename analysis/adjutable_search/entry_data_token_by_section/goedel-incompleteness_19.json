That is, in his\n1951 Gibbs lecture, G\u00f6del drew the following disjunctive\nconclusion from the incompleteness theorems: \n\n\neither \u2026 the human mind (even within the realm of pure\nmathematics) infinitely surpasses the power of any finite machine, or\nelse there exist absolutely unsolvable diophantine problems. \n\n\nG\u00f6del speaks about this statement as a \u201cmathematically\nestablished fact\u201d (G\u00f6del 1951; for more discussion on\nG\u00f6del\u2019s disjunctive claim, see, e.g., Shapiro 1998).\nAccording to G\u00f6del, the second alternative \n\n\nseems to disprove the view that mathematics is only our own creation\n\u2026 that mathematical objects and facts \u2026 exist\nobjectively and independently of our mental acts and decisions. \n\n\nG\u00f6del was nonetheless inclined to deny the possibility of\nabsolutely unsolvable problems, and although he did believe in\nmathematical Platonism, his reasons for this conviction were\ndifferent, and he did not maintain that the incompleteness theorems\nalone establish Platonism. Thus G\u00f6del believed in the first\ndisjunct, that the human mind infinitely surpasses the power of any\nfinite machine. Still, this conclusion of G\u00f6del follows, as\nG\u00f6del himself clearly explains, only if one denies, as does\nG\u00f6del, the possibility of humanly unsolvable problems. It is not\na necessary consequence of incompleteness theorems.\n\nNow G\u00f6del was, unlike the later advocates of the so-called\nG\u00f6delian anti-mechanist argument, sensitive enough to admit that\nboth mechanism and the alternative that there are humanly absolutely\nunsolvable problems are consistent with his incompleteness theorems.\nHis fundamental reasons for disliking the latter alternative are much\nmore philosophical. G\u00f6del thought in a somewhat Kantian way that\nhuman reason would be fatally irrational if it asked questions it\ncould not answer (for critical discussion, see Kreisel 1967; Boolos\n1995; Raatikainen 2005).\n\nAs a reaction to Lucas\u2019 argument, but before the publication of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Gibbs Lecture, Paul Benacerraf (1967) put forward\nmore qualified conclusions that interestingly resemble some ideas of\nG\u00f6del. He argued that it is consistent with all the facts that I\nam indeed a Turing machine, but that I cannot ascertain which one. For\nsome critical discussion, see Chihara 1972 and Hanson 1971.\n6.5 Mysticism and the existence of God?\n\nSometimes quite fantastic conclusions are drawn from\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems. It has been even suggested that\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems, if not exactly prove, at least give\nstrong support for mysticism or the existence of God. These\ninterpretations seem to assume one or more misunderstandings which\nhave already been discussed above: it is either assumed that\nG\u00f6del provided an absolutely unprovable sentence, or that\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems imply Platonism, or anti-mechanism, or\nboth.\n\nFor more discussion about the philosophical aspects of the\nincompleteness theorems, see Raatikainen 2005 and Franz\u00e9n\n2005.\nFurther reading\n\nA standard reference for the incompleteness theorems is:\n\nSmory\u0144ski, C., 1977, \u201cThe incompleteness\ntheorems,\u201d in Handbook of Mathematical Logic, J.\nBarwise (ed.), Amsterdam: North-Holland, pp. 821\u2013866\n [available online].\n\n\nThere are several introductory textbooks in mathematical logic which\ngive a good exposition of the incompleteness theorems and related\ntopics; for example:\n\nBoolos, G., and R. Jeffrey, 1989, Computability and\nLogic, 3rd revised edition, Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press.\nEnderton, H., 1972, A Mathematical Introduction to Logic,\nNew York: Academic Press.\nVan Dalen, D., 2004, Logic and Structure, 4th\nedition, Berlin: Springer.\n\n\nTwo books that are dedicated to the incompleteness theorems are:\n\nSmullyan, R., 1991, G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness\nTheorems, Oxford: Oxford University Press.\nSmith, P., 2007, An Introduction to G\u00f6del\u2019s\nTheorems, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\n\n\nAnother useful book on the incompleteness theorems and related topics\nis:\n\nMurawski, R., 1999, Recursive Functions and Metamathematics:\nProblems of Completeness and Decidability, G\u00f6del\u2019s\nTheorems. Dordrecht: Kluwer.\n\n\nA comprehensive, more advanced book on these themes is:\n\nH\u00e1jek, P. and Pudl\u00e1k, P., 1993, Metamathematics\nof First-Order Arithmetic, Berlin: Springer.\n\n\nAnother useful book, including also some more advanced topics is:\n\nFranz\u00e9n, T., 2004, Inexhaustibility: A Non-Exhaustive\nTreatment, Lecture Notes in Logic 16, ASL, Wellesley: A.K.\nPeters.\n\n\nThe more philosophical aspects around the incompleteness theorems are\nsurveyed in the following two sources (Franz\u00e9n is an\naccessible, informal, and yet reliable, explanation of the\nincompleteness theorems):\n\nRaatikainen, P., 2005, \u201cOn the Philosophical Relevance of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems,\u201d Revue\nInternationale de Philosophie, 59: 513\u2013534\n [available online].\nFranz\u00e9n, T., 2005, G\u00f6del\u2019s Theorem: An\nIncomplete Guide to its Use and Abuse, Wellesley: A.K.\nPeters.\n\n\nThe following two papers survey various issues around the first\nincompleteness theorem:\n\nBeklemishev, L. D., 2010, \u201cG\u00f6del incompleteness theorems\nand the limits of their applicability.
