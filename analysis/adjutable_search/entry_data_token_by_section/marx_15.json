    "main_text": "Economics || Reading Capital\n4.1 Reading Capital\n\nHow to read Marx\u2019s economic writings, and especially his\nmasterpiece Capital Volume 1,  remains a matter of\ncontroversy. An orthodox reading is that Marx\u2019s essential task\nis to contribute to economic theory, based on a modified form of the\nlabour theory of value. Others warn against such a narrow\ninterpretation, pointing out that the character of Marx\u2019s\nwriting and presentation is very far from what one would expect in a\nstandard economic text. Hence William Clare Roberts (2017), for\nexample, argues that Capital Volume 1 is fundamentally a work\nof political theory, rather than economics. Be that as it may,\nnevertheless, the work does contain substantial presentation of an\neconomic analysis of capitalism, and it is on this that we will focus\nhere.\n",
