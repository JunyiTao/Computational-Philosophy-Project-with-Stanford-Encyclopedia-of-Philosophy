Does Fine-Tuning for Life Require a Response?\n\nMany researchers believe that the fine-tuning of the universe\u2019s\nlaws, constants, and boundary conditions for life calls for inferring\nthe existence of a divine designer (see\n Section 3)\n or a multiverse\u2014a vast collection of universes with differing\nlaws, constants, and boundary conditions (see\n Section 4).\n The inference to a divine designer or a multiverse typically rests on\nthe idea that, in view of the required fine-tuning, life-friendly\nconditions are in some sense highly improbable if there is\nonly one, un-designed, universe. It is controversial, however, whether\nthis idea can coherently be fleshed out in terms of any philosophical\naccount of probability.\n",
