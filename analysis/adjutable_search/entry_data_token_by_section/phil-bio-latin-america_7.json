    "main_text": "The Problem of Race || Genomic Medicine and Forensic Genetics\n3.3 Genomic Medicine and Forensic Genetics\n\nThe flagbearer of the promises of genomic medicine in Mexico is the\nINMEGEN (Schwartz Mar\u00edn 2011; L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n &\nVergara Silva 2011). In addition to the aforementioned problematic\nsituations that genomic medicine must still overcome in order to\nfulfill its promises, Arroyo-Santos (2011), Garc\u00eda-Deister and\nL\u00f3pez-Beltr\u00e1n (2015), and L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n\n(2018) have emphasized that the relevant correlation in terms of\nprevention and improvement of the health of Mexicans is not between\nobesity or diabetes and certain genetic variants but rather between\nobesity or diabetes and the country\u2019s socioeconomic\ndeterioration and the associated growing malnutrition.\n\nFinally, we will refer to the analysis that has been made of forensic\ngenetics. In addition to the distinct degrees of development, the\ndifferent roles it plays in different countries have been pointed out\nby Garc\u00eda-Deister and L\u00f3pez-Beltr\u00e1n (2015, 2017).\nThus, whereas in Argentina forensic genetics was organized around\nsocial movements like Las Abuelas de la Plaza de Mayo, it has\nplayed a key role in the process of returning the remains of\ndisappeared persons to their families and in the search for children\nappropriated during the last military dictatorship (Penchaszadeh 2011,\nArgentine Forensic Anthropology Team\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n In Colombia, although forensic technicians are aware of disputes\namong population geneticists, they use and endorse the relations\nestablished between genetics, race, and geography because they fit\nwith common-sense notions of visible bodily difference and the\nregionalization of race in the Colombian nation\n(Schwartz-Mar\u00edn, Wade, Cruz-Santiago, & C\u00e1rdenas\n2015).\n",
