    "main_text": "Basic Concepts || Indian Background\n1.1 Indian Background\n\nBuddhism was founded some time between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE\nin South Asia. The fundamental teachings of Buddhism are that ordinary\nlife is suffused with (Skt.) dukkha (often translated as\n\u201csuffering\u201d), and that dukkha is caused by the\nillusory belief in persistent individual selves. The belief in selves\nleads to endless craving (Skt. tanha) which is unsatisfiable,\nbecause it is a longing by one illusory entity (the personal self) to\npermanently possess other equally illusory things. Escape from craving\n(and hence dukkha) is only possible by achieving\nenlightenment, which is fully believing the truth of no-self (Skt.\nanatman). Enlightenment leads to universal compassion:\ndukkha is seen to belong to no one, so there is no reason to\nprefer the elimination of what would conventionally be described as\n\u201cmy suffering\u201d to \u201cyour suffering\u201d or\n\u201ctheir suffering.\u201d The illusory world of independent\nselves is referred to as (Skt.) \u201csamsara,\u201d and\nthe state achieved through enlightenment is (Skt.)\n\u201cnirvana.\u201d \n\nThe two major sects of the Buddhist religion are Theravada and\nMahayana. These sects have a great variety of philosophical\nformulations, but three of the more influential schools are Abhidharma\n(Theravada), Madhyamaka (Mahayana), and Yogacara (Mahayana). Each of\nthese schools interprets the key concepts of Buddhism in different\nways. \n Abhidharma Buddhists\n argue that the things that are taken to be\nindependent, persistent selves by common sense (such as particular\nmonks like \u201cNagasena\u201d and objects like chariots) exist\nonly by convention. However, these conventionally existing entities\nare ontologically grounded in other, genuinely existing (Skt.)\n dharmas\n (entities such as instantaneous configurations of\nmatter, or temporary mental states). Although these dharmas\nare transient and causally dependent on one another, they also possess\na self-nature (Skt. \n svabhava). \n\nIn contrast, Madhyamaka Buddhists (like Nagarjuna) argue that, because\nall dharmas are causally dependent, nothing is ultimately\ngrounded. They describe this by saying that reality is characterized\nby \u201cemptiness\u201d \n(Skt. sunyata), in the sense that\neverything is \u201cempty\u201d of self-nature and an independent,\npersistent self. The doctrine of emptiness is easy to misunderstand,\nand is sometimes mistakenly conflated with metaphysical nihilism.\nHowever, Buddhists distinguish their view from both Annihilationism\n(Skt. uccheda-drsti) and Eternalism (Skt.\nsasvata-drsti). Annihilationism is the view that nothing\nexists in any sense, while Eternalism is the view that something\nexists that is eternal, unchanging, and unconditioned by anything\nelse. Madhyamaka denies both extremes, and holds that while\ndharmas do exist, each dharma\u2019s existence is\n\u201cconditioned\u201d (causally or conceptually dependent) on\nsomething else, without any ultimate ground. \n\nYogacara\n offers a third alternative: everything is \u201cempty\u201d\nof a mind-independent self. All that exists are mental states.\nConsistent with the doctrine of \u201cno-self,\u201d Yogacara\nBuddhists deny that there is a substantial entity that has, thinks, or\nexperiences the mental states. However, in order to explain why there\nare correlations among experiences (for example, why the apparent\nexperience of \u201cmy starting a fire\u201d is correlated with the\napparent experience of \u201cyou feeling warmth\u201d), Yogacara\nposits a \n repository consciousness\n (Skt. alayavijnana) which\nmetaphorically contains the \u201cseeds\u201d of previous\nexperiences that bear fruit in later experiences. \n",
