    "main_text": "Should we doubt the evidential force of intellectual intuitions? || Experimental philosophy\n6.2 Experimental philosophy\n\nA new branch of philosophy called experimental philosophy (X-phi for\nshort) has studied the intuitive judgments of people (often\nstudents) when presented with well-known examples in epistemology and\nethics. They ask these people (often from different ethnic, cultural,\neconomic, and educational backgrounds) whether someone in a\nhypothetical scenario knows, or only believes, that some proposition\nis true, say, in Sheep whether the person knows, or only\nbelieves, that there are sheep in the field. In ethics they may\npresent the subjects with a case and ask them if it is wrong, or not\nwrong, to do what is described. In a case often called\nTransplant, five innocent people are desperately in need of\ncertain vital organs, and the only way to save them is to cut up some\ninnocent person and distribute his organs to the five (transplant\nsurgery has been perfected and our potential donor is a perfect match\nto all five). Experimental philosophers will ask their subjects\nwhether it is wrong, or not wrong, to cut up the one to save the five,\nand then record their intuitive judgments. In another case\noften called Trolley, a runaway trolley is on track A\nand headed for five innocent people who are trapped on that track. All\nperson S can do to keep the trolley from running over the five\nis to turn the trolley down track B where one innocent person\nis trapped. If S does nothing, five will die; if he throws the\nswitch via a remote device, the one on track B will be killed.\nOr what if someone pushed a heavy person in front of the trolley to\nstop it from running over the five? Experimental philosophers ask\nwhether it would be wrong, or not wrong, for S to throw the\nswitch or push the man. They record the data, which they take to be\nintuitive judgments on the cases, and note differences in the\nresponses, say, between different ethnic or economic groups.\n\nSome of the initial studies that seemed to show that there are\ndifferences along ethnic, cultural, and economic lines in response to\nexamples have not been replicated (see Turri 2018; Wykstra 2018 for an\noverview of the work in X-Phi.). Other studies have been criticized\nbecause of their experimental design. Apart from these experimental\nflaws, claims about disagreements in intuition have been criticized as\nepistemically irrelevant because the so-called\n\u201cintuitions\u201d of subjects are not what philosophers have in\nmind when they refer to a priori or rational intuitions\n(Bealer 1998: 202, 213). If what philosophers mean by\n\u201cintuitions\u201d requires that they stem from full\nunderstanding of concepts in ideal cognitive circumstances, then the\n\u201cintuitions\u201d that experimental subjects have do not\nqualify, for they lack full understanding and the cognitive\ncircumstances they are in probably do not qualify as ideal.\n\nOne might think that from an epistemic standpoint, the\n\u201cintuitions\u201d that philosophers have when considering\n\u201csuitably elementary propositions\u201d are what should be\nstudied because, as Bealer said, \u201cif we limit ourselves to\nsuitably elementary propositions, then relative to them we\napproximate ideal cognitive conditions\u201d, and\nphilosophers come nearer to having a full understanding of the\nrelevant concepts. Studies of that sort are being done (see\nSchwitzgebel & Cushman 2012, 2015). Some results suggest that\nphilosophers\u2019 intuitions, like those of non-philosophers, are\naffected by how an example is described (called \u201cframing\neffects\u201d) and by the order in which the examples are presented\n(\u201cordering effects\u201d). This suggests that the intuitions of\nphilosophers are no more reliable than those of non-philosophers. But\nperhaps the experimental situation is not ideal and that ideal\nconditions are the ordinary settings in which philosophers do their\nwork. (See, Kahneman\u2019s description (2011: 234\u2013235) of the\napproach taken by Gary Klein and his followers who criticize\nartificial experiments and recommend studying \u201creal people doing\nthings that matter\u201d (Kahneman 2011: 235).\n",
