    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe topic of divine freedom concerns the extent to which a divine\nbeing \u2014 in particular, the supreme divine being, God \u2014 can\nbe free.  Two preliminary questions play a central role in framing the\ndiscussion of divine freedom. I: Apart from freedom, what properties\nare held to be essential to God? II: What conception(s) of freedom\ngovern the inquiry? Discussions of divine freedom typically concern\nthe traditional conception of God as a being who is essentially\nomnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and eternal. With respect to\nthe second question, there are two conceptions of freedom common in\nphilosophical discussion: the compatibilist conception and the\nlibertarian conception. The topic of divine freedom concerns the\nquestion of whether God, as traditionally conceived, can enjoy\nwhatever sort and degree of freedom required for moral responsibility,\nthankfulness, and praise. But when it is asked, \u201cCan God be\nFree?\u201d it is important to specify what it is about which God\nmight be thought to act freely. Since God is essentially omnipotent,\nomniscient, perfectly good, and eternal, it is clear that God is not\nfree to weaken himself, to become ignorant, to do something evil, or\nto destroy himself. But it does seem important that God be free with\nrespect to bringing about any one of a number of possible worlds, as\nwell as free to bring about no world at all. What if, however, among\npossible worlds there is one that is the best? Is God then free to\ncreate any world other than the best?  This question has been a center\nof controversy for centuries. In considering this question and others\nit will be helpful to consider the views of some important\nphilosophers who have contributed significantly to the literature on\nthe topic of divine freedom. The philosophers whose views will be\nconsidered most fully are Leibniz and Samuel Clarke. These two are\nparticularly important because, in addition to being very able\nphilosophers, they engaged each other in the controversy between the\ncompatibilist's and the libertarian view of freedom. In the justly\nfamous Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, Leibniz championed\ncompatibilism, while Clarke represented the libertarian cause. In\naddition to Leibniz and Clarke, some important 20th century\ncontributions on this topic by Thomas Morris and Robert Adams will\nalso be discussed.\n",
