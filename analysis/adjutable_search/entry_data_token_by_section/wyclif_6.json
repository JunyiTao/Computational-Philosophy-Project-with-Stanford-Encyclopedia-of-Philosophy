    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Being and analogy\n3.1 Being and analogy\n\nThe point of departure for Wyclif\u2019s metaphysics is the notion of\nbeing, since it occupies the central place in his ontology. After Duns\nScotus, the real issue for metaphysics was the relationship between\nbeing and, on the other side, God and creatures, as Scotus\u2019\ntheory of the univocity of the concept of being was an absolute\nnovelty, full of important consequences for the development of later\nmedieval philosophy. Wyclif takes many aspects from Scotus\u2019\nexplanation, but strongly stresses the ontological implications of the\ndoctrine. Wyclif, like Scotus, claims that the notion of being is the\nmost general one, a notion entailed by all others, but he also states\nthat an extra-mental reality corresponds to the concept of\nbeing-in-general (ens in communi). This extra-mental reality\nis predicated of everything (God and creatures, substances and\naccidents, universal and individual essences) according to different\ndegrees, since God is in the proper sense of the term and any\nother entity is (something real) only insofar as it shares the being\nof God (De ente in communi, chap. 1, pp. 1\u20132; chap. 2,\np. 29; De ente praedicamentali, chap. 1, p. 13; chap. 4, p.\n30; Tractatus de universalibus, chap. 4, p. 89; chap. 7, p.\n130; chap. 12, p. 279; De materia et forma, chap. 6, p.\n213).\n\nIf being is a reality, it is then clear that it is impossible to\naffirm its univocity. The Doctor Subtilis thought of being as\nsimply a concept, and therefore could describe it as univocal in a\nbroad sense (one name \u2014 one concept \u2014 many natures).\nWyclif, on the contrary, is convinced that the being-in-general is an\nextra-mental reality, so he works out his theory at a different level\nthan does Scotus: no more at the intensional level (the meaning\nconnected with the univocal sign, or univocum univocans), but\nat the extensional one (the thing signified by the mental sign,\nconsidered as shared by different entities according to different\ndegrees). For that reason, he cannot use Aristotelian univocation,\nwhich hides these differences in sharing. Thus he denies the univocity\nof being and prefers to use one of the traditional notions of analogy\n(De ente praedicamentali, chap. 3, pp. 25, 27), since the\nbeing of God is the measure of the being of other things, which are\ndrawn up on a scale with the separated spiritual substances at the top\nand prime matter at the bottom. Therefore he qualifies being as an\nambiguous genus (ibidem, p. 29), borrowing an expression\nalready used by Grosseteste in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nPosterior Analytics. The analogy of being does not entail a\nmultiplicity of correlated meanings, however, as in Thomas Aquinas.\nSince Wyclif hypostatizes the notion of being and considers\nequivocity, analogy, and univocity as real relations between things,\nnot as semantic relations between terms and things, his analogy is\npartially equivalent to the standard Aristotelian univocity, since\nwhat differentiates analogy from univocity is the way a certain nature\n(or property) is shared by a set of things: analogous things\n(analoga) share it according to different degrees\n(secundum magis et minus, or secundum prius et\nposterius), while univocal things (univoca) share it all\nin the same manner and at the same degree. This is the true sense of\nhis distinction between ambiguous genera, like being and accident\n(accidens), and logical genera, like substance (De ente\npraedicamentali, chap. 4, pp. 30, 32). Hence, according to this\naccount, being in general is the basic component of the metaphysical\nstructure of each reality, which possesses it in accordance with its\nown nature, value, and position in the hierarchy of created\nbeings.\n\nUnfortunately, this theory is weak in an important point, since Wyclif\ndoes not clarify the relation between being-in-general and God. On the\none hand, being is a creature, the first of all the creatures; on the\nother hand, God should share it, as being-in-general is the most\ncommon reality, predicated of all, and according to him\nto-be-predicated-of something means to-be-shared-by it. As a\nconsequence, a creature would be in some respect superordinated to God\n\u2014 a theological puzzle that Wyclif failed to acknowledge.\n",
