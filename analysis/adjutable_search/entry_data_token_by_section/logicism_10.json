Recent Work Inspired by the Grundgesetze, or Departing From It\n\nWe have seen that there has been a revival of interest in neologicism\nsince the early 1980s. One of the ways in which work in this period\nhas sought to rescue logicism from Fregean disaster (without\nsacrificing Basic Law V altogether, and without invoking HP as a\nstarting point) has been the study of various \u2018fragments of\nGrundgesetze\u2019. The collectively shared idea of this\ncompany of scholars, deriving from Parsons 1987, is as follows:\nFrege\u2019s Grundgesetze succumbed to Russell\u2019s Paradox.\nBut Frege\u2019s system is a big one. Let us see if we can extract a\nfragment of it that is (a) consistent, and (b) strong enough to afford\na decent amount of\n Arithmetik.[48]\n This is typical of standard consistency-restoring revisions of\ntheories troubled by inconsistency, but whose main goal(s) one is\ntrying to salvage from the wreckage. The progress that has been made\nin this direction thus far is worth reporting. We shall call these\ntheoretical efforts \u2018fragmenting\u2019.\n\nThe fragmenting scholars just mentioned all take as primitive a\nterm-forming variable-binding abstraction operator that applies to\npredicates to form singular terms. Their notational choices for this\noperator vary. Here we shall speak generically of terms of the form\n\\(@xA(x)\\). For \\(@\\), Parsons follows Frege in using a breath mark\n(like a comma) placed above the variable \\(x\\). Heck uses a\ncaret (circumflex) placed immediately before \\(x\\), and\nplaces a period immediately after \\(x\\) in the variable-binding\nprefix. Wehmeier uses the caret placed immediately above\n\\(x\\). Boccuni (not exactly a fragmenter\u2014see below) uses the\nformulation \\(\\{x:A(x)\\}\\) with a colon where contemporary set\ntheorists would have a solidus: \\(\\{x \\mid A(x)\\}\\). Each of these\nauthors is therefore using some form of set- or class-abstraction\nterms, formed by means of a variable-binding abstraction operator.\n\nReturning to our use of \\(@\\) as a generic symbol covering each of\nthese idiosyncratic variants, we remind the reader that Basic Law V,\nin schematic form (where \\(A(x)\\) and \\(B(x)\\) are\nplaceholders for formulae), would be expressed as \n\\[@xA(x)=@xB(x)\\leftrightarrow\\forall x(A(x)\\leftrightarrow B(x)).\\]\n\n\nBasic Law V in axiomatic form would be second-order:\n\n\\[ \\forall F \\forall G [@xF(x) = @xG(x) \\leftrightarrow \\forall x(F(x)\n\\leftrightarrow G(x))].  \\]\n\n\nParsons 1987 gives a model-theoretic proof that schema V is\nconsistent with first-order logic. (This had been conjectured by\nSchroeder-Heister 1987.) J. Burgess 1998 gives a proof-theoretic and\nconstructive proof of the same result. Heck 1996 extends\nParsons\u2019 argument to prove that both the simple and the ramified\npredicative fragments of Frege\u2019s system are consistent.\nWehmeier 1999 provides a consistency proof for a theory in monadic\nsecond-order logic, consisting of axiom V and a higher-order\ncomprehension principle. Ferreira and Wehmeier 2002 proves the\nconsistency of schema V and the same comprehension\nprinciple. The higher-order principle in question is known as\n \\(\\Delta^{1}_1\\)-comprehension.[49]\n\nAnother recent innovation akin to the study of proper fragments of\nGrundgesetze involves use of the resources of the logic of\n plural quantification.\n This of course takes us out of the realm of genuine\nfragments of Grundgesetze. But the ideas are closely\nrelated to those of the foregoing fragmenters.\n\nBoccuni 2011 provides an interpretation for a language admitting\nplural quantification, an interpretation that Boccuni argues makes\ntrue every instance of the principles constituting the system she\ncalls PG (short for \u2018Plural Grundgesetze\u2019). These\nare a Plural Comprehension Principle, a Predicative Comprehension\nPrinciple, and Schema V. Boccuni 2013 presents PG as \u2018a\nconsistent second-order system which is aimed [at deriving]\nsecond-order Peano\n arithmetic\u2019.[50]\n\nAnother recent innovation in the quest for a workable neologicist\nunderstanding of Fregean (double-barreled) abstraction that is worthy\nof mention was by Studd 2016. As he points out,\n\n\nThe key drawback with existing responses in this style [i.e., avoiding\n\u2018full second-order logic with an impredicative comprehension\nprinciple for Concepts\u2019] is that they undermine the neologicist\nrecovery of mathematics. Frege\u2019s theorem relies on full\nsecond-order logic. The predicative theory, and its ramified variants,\nare too weak to interpret second-order arithmetic, PA\\(_2\\) (see John\nP. Burgess 2005, ch. 2).\n\n\nIn his exposition Studd eschews the use of plural logic, but makes\nremarks along the way to the effect that one could use plural-logical\nlanguage to express his claims, if one so wished. He reverts to\nconsideration of abstractive terms. He diagnoses the problem of\nfinding an \u201cadequacy criterion \u2026 to sift the\n\u2018good\u2019 [double-barreled\u2014NT] abstraction principles\nlike Hume\u2019s principle from the \u2018bad\u2019 ones like Basic\nLaw V.\u201d He concludes that this approach to the bad company\nproblem\n\n\nis on the wrong track \u2026 if neologicists are to retain the\nambition of extending their success with arithmetic to other branches\nof mathematics, including standard Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set\ntheory.\n\n\nStudd diagnoses the problem with double-barreled abstraction\nprinciples as arising from the fact that they are static.\nThey are taken to govern an all-inclusive domain that cannot itself be\nextended with denotations for the abstractive terms featuring on the\nleft-hand side. Studd proposes that we should instead conceive of\nabstraction as dynamic, in allowing for extension of the\ndomain by the newly abstracted abstracta. And he formulates a theory\nof double-barreled abstraction that would permit this.\n",
