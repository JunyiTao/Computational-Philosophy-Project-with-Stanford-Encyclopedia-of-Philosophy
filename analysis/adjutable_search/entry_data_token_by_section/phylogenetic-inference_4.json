    "main_text": "Phylogenetic Inference and Philosophy || Computational Limits and Big Data\n2.2 Computational Limits and Big Data\n\nBearing in mind what we said above about the interconnectedness of\ncharacter analysis and phylogenetic analysis, we will now proceed to\nthe second part, analysis of the data. At this stage, computational\nlimits loom large. Even if we are concerned only with inferring the\ntopology of a phylogeny, the number of possible trees grows\nexponentially relative to the number of terminal branches we include\non a tree. The formula for calculating the number of possible tree\ntopologies is relatively straight-forward (Felsenstein 2004):\n\n\\[\\frac{(2n-3)!}{2^{n-2}(n-2)!}\\]\n\n\nwhere n is the number of taxa. The upshot is that even a\nsmall expansion of terminal branches results in an exponential\nincrease in the number of possible topologies. So, for example, there\nare 15 possible phylogenetic trees for a group of 4 species, over 34\nmillion for 10 species, and \\(8 \\times 10^{21}\\) with 20\n species.[6]\n\nThis means that exhaustive evaluation of all possible hypotheses very\nquickly becomes all but impossible\u2014even as our capacity for this\nhas grown with increased computing power. Finding the most\nparsimonious tree, the maximum likelihood tree, and even doing a\nmultiple sequence alignment to begin with are all NP-complete\n problems[7]\n (Graham & Foulds 1982; Wang & Jiang 1994; Chor & Tuller\n2005). Bayesian inference is similarly computationally intractable\n(Ronquist, Mark, & Huelsenbeck 2009).\n\nIn response, researchers have developed heuristic search strategies to\nexplore possible tree space. For example, in Bayesian analysis the\nprobability space of possible trees is so large that starting by\nrandomly selecting a tree will be highly inefficient. It will almost\nsurely fail to provide a good estimate of the posterior probability\ndistribution, since the interesting regions will only occupy a small\npart of that distribution space (Ronquist et al. 2009). A common\nheuristic is to start with a parsimony or distance-methods tree.\nThough these methods typically perform worse than model-based\napproaches, they are much less computationally expensive and can\nquickly generate an initially plausible tree that Bayesian\nphylogeneticists use as a launching off point to explore the tree\nprobability space (e.g., using hill-climbing algorithms such as Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling). Innovations like these are one\nreason that computational phylogenetics is an important field in both\nstatistics and computer science. Philosophers of science interested in\nhow scientists explore and use so-called \u201cBig Data\u201d would\nprofit from examining how phylogeneticists have developed, adapted,\nand employed heuristic search strategies.\n\nSetting aside computational and practical problems leaves us with what\nappears to be a straightforward epistemological question\u2014which\nmethods are best justified in licensing phylogenetic inferences? We\nbegin our examination of this question by looking at arguments in\nfavor of a particular method, parsimony.\n",
