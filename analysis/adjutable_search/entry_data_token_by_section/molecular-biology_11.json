    "main_text": "Molecular Biology and General Philosophy of Science || Explanation\n3.2 Explanation\n\nTraditionally, philosophers of science took successful scientific\nexplanations to result from derivation from laws of nature (see the\nentries on\n laws of nature\n and\n scientific explanation).\n On this deductive-nomological account (Hempel and Oppenheim 1948), an\nexplanation of particular observation statements was analyzed as\nsubsumption under universal (applying throughout the universe),\ngeneral (exceptionless), necessary (not contingent) laws of nature\nplus the initial conditions of the particular case. Philosophers of\nbiology have criticized this traditional analysis as inapplicable to\nbiology, and especially molecular biology.\n\nSince the 1960s, philosophers of biology have questioned the existence\nof biological laws of nature. J. J. C. Smart (1963) emphasized the\nearth-boundedness of the biological sciences (in conflict with the\nuniversality of natural laws). No purported \u201claw\u201d in\nbiology has been found to be exceptionless, even for life on earth (in\nconflict with the generality of laws). And John Beatty (1995) argued\nthat the purported \u201claws\u201d of, for example, Mendelian\ngenetics, were contingent on evolution (in conflict with the necessity\nof natural laws). (For further discussion, see Brandon 1997; Lange\n2000; Mitchell 1997; Sober 1997; Waters 1998; Weber 2005.) Hence,\nphilosophers\u2019 search for biological laws of nature,\ncharacterized as universal, necessary generalizations, has ceased.\n\nWithout traditional laws of nature from which to derive explanations,\nphilosophers of biology have been forced to rethink the nature of\nscientific explanation in biology and, in particular, molecular\nbiology. Two accounts of explanation emerged: the unificationist and\nthe causal-mechanical. Philip Kitcher (1989, 1993) developed a\nunificationist account of explanation, and he and Sylvia Culp\nexplicitly applied it to molecular biology (Culp and Kitcher 1989).\nAmong the premises of the \u201cWatson-Crick\u201d argument schema\nwere \u201ctranscription, post-transcriptional modification and\ntranslation for the alleles in question\u201d, along with details of\ncell biology and embryology for the organisms in question (Kitcher\n1989). An explanation of a particular pattern of distribution of\nprogeny phenotypes in a genetic cross resulted from instantiating the\nappropriate deductive argument schema: the variables were filled with\nthe details from the particular case and the conclusion derived from\nthe premises.\n\nWorking in the causal-mechanical tradition pioneered by Wesley Salmon\n(1984, 1998), other philosophers turned to understanding mechanism\nelucidation as the avenue to scientific explanation in biology\n(Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2005; Bechtel and Richardson 1993; Craver\n2007; Darden 2006a; Glennan 2002; Machamer, Darden, and Craver 2000;\nSarkar 1998; Schaffner 1993; Woodward 2002, 2010). There are\ndifferences between the various accounts of a mechanism, but they hold\nin common the basic idea that a scientist provides a successful\nexplanation of a phenomenon by identifying and manipulating variables\nin the mechanisms thereby determining how those variables are situated\nin and make a difference in the mechanism; the ultimate explanation\namounts to the elucidation of how those mechanism components act and\ninteract to produce the phenomenon under investigation. As mentioned\nabove (see\n Section 2.1,\n see also entry on mechanisms in science), an elucidated mechanism\nallows for the explanatory features of understanding, prediction, and\ncontrol.\n\nThere are several virtues of the causal-mechanical approach to\nunderstanding scientific explanation in molecular biology. For one, it\nis truest to molecular biologists\u2019 own language when engaging in\nbiological explanation. Molecular biologists rarely describe their\npractice and achievements as the development of new theories; rather,\nthey describe their practice and achievements as the elucidation of\nmolecular mechanisms (Baetu 2017; Craver 2001; Machamer, Darden,\nCraver 2000). Another virtue of the causal-mechanical approach is that\nit captures biological explanations of both regularity and variation.\nUnlike in physics, where a scientist assumes that an electron is an\nelectron is an electron, a biologist is often interested in precisely\nwhat makes one individual different from another, one population\ndifferent from another, or one species different from another.\nPhilosophers have extended the causal-mechanical account of\nexplanation to cover biological explanations of variation, be it\nacross evolutionary time (Calcott 2009) or across individuals in a\npopulation (Tabery 2009, 2014). Tabery (2009, 2014) characterized\nbiological explanations of variation across individuals in a\npopulation as the elucidation of \u201cdifference mechanisms\u201d.\nDifference mechanisms are regular causal mechanisms made up of\ndifference-making variables, one or more of which are actual\ndifference makers (see\n Section 2.3\n for the discussion of Waters\u2019 (2007) concept of an actual\ndifference maker). There is regularity in difference mechanisms;\ninterventions made on variables in the mechanisms that change the\nvalues of the variables lead to different outcomes in the phenomena\nunder investigation. There is also variation in difference mechanisms;\ninterventions need not be taken to find differences in outcomes\nbecause, with difference mechanisms, some variables are actual\ndifference makers which already take different values in the natural\nworld, resulting in natural variation in the outcomes.\n\nBut philosophers have also raised challenges to the causal-mechanical\napproach. One complaint has been that mechanistic explanations\ndon\u2019t work well in systems biology, a field distinct from\nmolecular biology but that nonetheless draws on the work of molecular\nbiologists. While some argue that systems biology is best explained\nusing mechanisms (cf. Boogerd et al. 2007; Matthiessen 2017;\nRichardson and Stephan 2007; Bechtel 2011; Bechtel and Abrahamsen\n2013), others argue that it requires non-mechanistic explanation (cf.\nBraillard 2010; Kuhlmann 2011; Silberstein and Chemero 2013).\n\nAnother complaint has been that mechanistic explanations fail to\nprovide a satisfactory account of the complexity of living systems\nbecause they fail to devote serious attention to the \u201cthoroughly\nprocessual character of living systems\u201d (Dupre 2012: 19). Those\nwho prefer a \u201cprocess-oriented\u201d ontology (Bapteste and\nDupre 2013; Bickhard 2011; Campbell 2015; Dupre 2012; Jaeger and Monk\n2015; Jaeger et al. 2012; Meincke 2018; Nicholson and Dupre 2018)\nargue that mechanistic accounts mistakenly assume that parts composing\na mechanism can be identified independently of the activities or\nprocesses in which they are involved. Instead, as Anne Sophie Maincke\nexplains, if there are parts or substances, they must be\n\u201creconceptualised as stabilized higher-order processes that\npersist as long as stabilization can be maintained\u201d (2018).\nProcesses are ontologically primary. Recent literature in molecular\nbiology on molecular pathways (cf. Boniolo and Campaner 2018; Brigandt\n2018; Ioannides and Psillos 2017; Ross 2018) seems to be another\ninstantiation of this shift from mechanistic to processual\nexplanations. But Christopher Austin (2016) has recently challenged\nthe idea that processual explanations can be sufficiently grounded\n\u201cwithout the metaphysical underpinning of the very\nmechanisms which processes purport to replace\u201d (639).\n",
