    "main_text": "Bayesian Networks for Legal Applications\n3. Bayesian Networks for Legal Applications\n So far we examined how probability theory can help to assess single items of evidence such as a DNA match. But things are often more complicated.\nIn legal cases, different lines of evidence may converge, such as two\nwitnesses who testify that the defendant was seen at the crime scene,\nor they may diverge, such as a witness who asserts the defendant was\nseen at the crime scene while DNA testing shows no genetic match\nbetween the defendant and the scene. Another source of complexity is\nthat the hypotheses put forward by the parties in a trial are often\ncomplex structures of statements. How can different statements, and\ntheir supporting evidence, be combined and the overall\nprosecutor\u2019s case (or the defense\u2019s case) be\nevaluated?\n\nThe probability of a hypothesis given multiple pieces of evidence can,\nin principle, be assessed by sequential applications of Bayes\u2019\ntheorem. Consider, for example, a case in which the defendant faces\ntwo pieces of incriminating evidence: a DNA match and hair evidence\nfound at the scene matching the defendant\u2019s hair color.\nAssume\u2014as is often done\u2014that someone\u2019s hair color is\nindependent of someone\u2019s genetic profile. Say the likelihood\nratio of hair evidence is 40 and the likelihood ratio of the DNA match\nis 200, that is, it is 40 times more likely (and 200 times more\nlikely) to find the evidence given the guilt hypothesis than the\ninnocence hypothesis. If the prior odds of guilt to innocence are\n\\(\\slashfrac{1}{1000}\\), the posterior odds would be\n\\(\\slashfrac{1}{1000}\\times 40\\times 200=8\\).\n\nThese calculations are straightforward, but in more realistic cases,\nthere will be complications. The parties at trial will often put\nforward several piecemeal claims that need to be combined together to\nform a theory of what happened. For example, the prosecutor may\npresent eyewitness testimony to argue that the defendant ran away from\nthe crime scene, along with documentary evidence as proof of a motive.\nThe different piecemeal claims, each supported by distinct pieces of\nevidence, must be combined to form structured hypotheses about what\nhappened. Since different claims and different pieces of evidence may\ndepend on one another, direct calculations would soon become\nunmanageable. Fortunately, a tool exists to make the task easier:\nBayesian networks. This section identifies guidelines for deploying\nBayesian networks in the presentation, aggregation and evaluation of\ncomplex bodies of evidence and hypotheses.\n",
