    "main_text": "Truth and language || The coherence theory and meaning\n6.6 Truth and assertion\n\nThe relation between truth and meaning is not the only place where\ntruth and language relate closely. Another is the idea, also\nmuch-stressed in the writings of Dummett (e.g., 1959), of the relation\nbetween truth and assertion. Again, it fits into a platitude:\n\nTruth is the aim of assertion.\n\n\nA person making an assertion, the platitude holds, aims to say\nsomething true.\n\nIt is easy to cast this platitude in a way that appears false. Surely,\nmany speakers do not aim to say something true. Any speaker who lies\ndoes not. Any speaker whose aim is to flatter, or to deceive, aims at\nsomething other than truth.\n\nThe motivation for the truth-assertion platitude is rather different.\nIt looks at assertion as a practice, in which certain rules are\nconstitutive. As is often noted, the natural parallel here is\nwith games, like chess or baseball, which are defined by certain\nrules. The platitude holds that it is constitutive of the practice of\nmaking assertions that assertions aim at truth. An assertion by its\nnature presents what it is saying as true, and any assertion which\nfails to be true is ipso facto liable to criticism, whether\nor not the person making the assertion themself wished to have said\nsomething true or to have lied.\n\nDummett\u2019s original discussion of this idea was partially a\ncriticism of deflationism (in particular, of views of Strawson, 1950).\nThe idea that we fully explain the concept of truth by way of the\nTarski biconditionals is challenged by the claim that the\ntruth-assertion platitude is fundamental to truth. As Dummett there\nput it, what is left out by the Tarski biconditionals, and captured by\nthe truth-assertion platitude, is the point of the concept of\ntruth, or what the concept is used for. (For further discussion, see\nGlanzberg, 2003a and Wright, 1992.)\n\nWhether or not assertion has such constitutive rules is, of course,\ncontroversial. But among those who accept that it does, the place of\ntruth in the constitutive rules is itself controversial. The leading\nalternative, defended by Williamson (1996), is that knowledge, not\ntruth, is fundamental to the constitutive rules of assertion.\nWilliamson defends an account of assertion based on the rule that one\nmust assert only what one knows.\n\nFor more on truth and assertion, see the papers in Brown and Cappelen\n(2011) and the entry on\n assertion.\n",
