    "main_text": "Free Will\n3. Free Will\n\n\nHow to reconcile the complementary agency of God and of natural causes\nwas a central metaphysical problem for those, in the seventeenth\ncentury, who accepted divine intervention in the natural world. One of\nthe solutions offered (for example, by Malebranche and La Forge) was\noccasionalism, which resulted in part from a recognition of God's\nomnipotence. Unless God's causality were understood as inadequately\nefficacious, occasionalists thought it was redundant to require a\nsupplementary causal activity on the part of natural phenomena or\nhuman agents in order to cause the effects that are attributed both to\nthem and to God's agency. Pascal's account of free will reflected this\ndilemma at the heart of human choice. His discussion owes much to that\nof Augustine (2010), On Free Choice.\n\n\nPascal was little concerned about the freedom of human choices that\nresult, for example, in deciding to read one book rather than another,\nor in analyses of what it means to claim that an agent could have\nchosen or done otherwise. The comprehensive concupiscence under which\nhuman nature struggled, according to Pascal's account of the Fall,\nimplied that what are usually called human \u2018choices\u2019 are\ndetermined by the dominant desires of each individual. That provided a\nnaturalistic theory of mundane human choices. The less mundane cases,\nwhich were the focus of Pascal's interest, include those where someone\n\u2018chooses\u2019 to act morally or otherwise. According to the\nJansenist theory of grace, God intervenes in the lives of individuals\nand makes it possible for them to choose something that otherwise they\ncould not have chosen, namely, to act in a manner that is conducive to\nsalvation. If God's assistance is sufficient to guarantee the efficacy\nof a human choice, it would seem that the choice of a human agent is\ndetermined by God's greater power. On the other hand, if God's grace\nwere inefficacious, it would seem as if He provides inadequate\nassistance because He relies on natural human powers to exercise free\nwill and thereby to supply what is missing from divine grace. This\nlatter position was rejected by Pascal as heretical and\nsemi-Pelagian.\n\n\nPascal's solution was to endorse an interpretation of Augustine's\ntheory of grace, and to re-describe as \u2018free\u2019 the choice\nof a human will that is \u2018infallibly\u2019 motivated by God's\nefficacious grace.\nHuman beings, by their own nature, always have the power\nto sin and to resist grace, and since the time of their corruption\nthey always have an unfortunate depth of concupiscence which\ninfinitely increases this power of resistance. Nevertheless, when it\npleases God to touch them with his mercy, He makes them do what he\nwants them to do and in the manner in which he wishes them to act,\nwithout this infallibility of God's operation destroying in any way\nthe natural freedom of human beings \u2026 That is how God disposes\nthe free will of human beings without imposing any necessity on them,\nand how free will, which can always resist grace but does not always\nwish to do so, directs itself both freely and infallibly towards\nGod. (Provincial Letters: I, 800, 801)\nThe \u00c9crits sur la gr\u00e2ce, which was drafted at\nabout the same time as the\nProvincial Letters, summarizes the Augustinian position as\nfollows: God predestines some human beings for salvation and saves\nthem by \u201cmeans that are certain and infallible\u201d (II,\n262). There are also others to whom God gave graces \u201cthat would\nhave led them to salvation had they used them properly\u201d (I,\n262), but He chose not to provide them with the \u2018unique grace of\nperseverance\u2019 without which it is impossible to be saved. By\ndefending the necessity of God's grace and its infallible efficacy,\nand by assuming that some people resist this divine assistance, Pascal\nwas forced by the logic of his position to endorse a theory of divine\npredestination. If God were to provide efficacious grace to each\nperson, they could not fail to be saved.  Therefore, if some are\ndamned, that must be because God has decided not to rescue them from\nthe Fallen condition into which they have been born as a result of\nAdam's sin.\n\n\nIt would be easy, philosophically, to accept the limitations of\nhuman powers on which this account is based as a theologically inspired\naccount of weakness of the will. However, it is difficult to see in\nwhat sense human choice is free when it is determined infallibly by a\ndivinely originated desire that the will of each individual, to whom it\nis granted, finds irresistible. For Pascal, one's choice of\nsalvation is free in the sense that it expresses one's strongest\ndesire; but the desire itself is communicated only to those who are\npredestined by God, and is such that the recipient is guaranteed to\nfollow it.\n",
