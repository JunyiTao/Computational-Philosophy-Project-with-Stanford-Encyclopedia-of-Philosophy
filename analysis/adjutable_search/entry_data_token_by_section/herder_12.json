    "main_text": "Political Philosophy\n10. Political Philosophy\n\nHerder is not usually thought of as a political philosopher. But he\nwas one, and moreover one whose political ideals are more admirable,\ntheoretical stances more defensible, and thematic focuses of more\nenduring relevance than those of any other German philosopher of the\nperiod (including Kant). His most developed treatment of political\nphilosophy occurs relatively late, in a work prompted by the French\nRevolution of 1789: the Letters for the Advancement of\nHumanity (1793\u20137) (including the early draft from 1792,\nwhich is important for its frank statement of his views about domestic\npolitics).\n\nWhat are the main features of Herder\u2019s political philosophy? Let\nus begin with his political ideals, first in domestic and\nthen in international politics. In domestic politics, the mature\nHerder is a liberal, a republican, a democrat, and an egalitarian\n(this, it should be noted, in historical circumstances where such\npositions were by no means commonplace, and were embraced at a\npersonal cost).\n\nHis liberalism is especially radical in that it advocates\nvirtually unrestricted freedom of thought and expression (including\nfreedom of worship). He has several reasons for this position: (1) He\nfeels that such freedom belongs to people\u2019s moral dignity. (2)\nHe believes that it is essential for individuals\u2019\nself-realization. (3) He believes that people\u2019s capacities for\ndiscerning the truth are very limited and that it is only through a\nconstant contest between opposing viewpoints that the cause of truth\ngets advanced. (John Stuart Mill would later borrow from these\nconsiderations\u2014largely via Wilhelm von Humboldt\u2014to form\nthe core of his own case for freedom of thought and expression in\nOn Liberty.)\n\nHerder is also committed to republicanism and democracy\n(advocating a much broader franchise than Kant, for example). He has\nseveral reasons for this position, ultimately deriving from an\negalitarian concern for the interests of all members of society: (1)\nHe feels it to be intrinsically right that the mass of people should\nshare in their government, rather than having it imposed upon them.\n(2) He believes that this will better serve their other\ninterests as well, since government by also tends to be\ngovernment for. (3) He in particular believes that it will\ndiminish the warfare that is pervasive under the prevailing autocratic\npolitical r\u00e9gimes of Europe, where it benefits the few rulers\nwho decide on it but costs the mass of people dearly.\n\nFinally, Herder\u2019s egalitarianism also extends beyond\nthat. He does not reject class differences, property, or inequalities\nof property outright. But he does oppose all hierarchical oppression;\nargue that all people in society have capacities for self-realization,\nand should receive the opportunity to fulfill them; and insist that\ngovernment should intervene to ensure that they do receive it, for\nexample, by guaranteeing education and a minimum standard of living\nfor the poor.\n\nConcerning international politics, Herder has often been classified as\na \u201cnationalist\u201d or (perhaps even worse) a \u201cGerman\nnationalist\u201d (for example, by R.R. Ergang in Herder and the\nFoundations of German Nationalism [1931] and K.R. Popper in\nThe Open Society and its Enemies [1945]). Some other\nphilosophers from the period deserve such a characterization (for\ninstance, Fichte). But where Herder is concerned it is deeply\nmisleading and unjust. On the contrary, like Kant\u2019s, his\nfundamental position in international politics is a committed\ncosmopolitanism, an impartial concern for all human\nbeings. This is a large part of the force of his ideal of\n\u201chumanity\u201d. Hence, for example, in the Letters for the\nAdvancement he approvingly quotes F\u00e9nelon\u2019s remark,\n\u201cI love my family more than myself; more than my family my\nfatherland; more than my fatherland humankind\u201d\n(HPW 389). Moreover, Herder\u2019s cosmopolitanism\nis arguably a good deal purer than Kant\u2019s. Kant\u2019s is\nundermined by various prejudices that he harbors \u2013 in\nparticular, racism, antisemitism, and misogyny (for a charitable\ndiscussion, see Kleingeld 2013). By contrast, Herder\u2019s is free\nof such prejudices, which he indeed worked tirelessly to combat.\n\nHerder does indeed also insist on respecting, preserving, and\nadvancing national groupings. However, this is entirely unalarming,\nfor the following reasons: (1) For Herder, this is emphatically\nsomething that must be done for all national groupings\nequally\u2014not just or especially Germany! (In the\nLetters for the Advancement he emphatically rejects any such\nnotion of a \u201cfavorite people [Favoritvolk]\u201d, as\nhe puts it [HPW 394].) (2) The \u201cnation\u201d\nin question is not racial but linguistic and cultural (in the\nIdeas and elsewhere Herder indeed criticizes and rejects the\nvery concept of race). (3) Herder does not seek to seal off nations\nfrom each other\u2019s influence or to keep them static; he regards\ninter-linguistic and -cultural exchange and linguistic-cultural\ndevelopment as normal and welcomes them. (4) Nor does his commitment\nto national groupings involve a centralized, militarized state (in the\nIdeas and elsewhere he strongly advocates the disappearance\nof such a state and its replacement by loosely federated local\ngovernments with minimal instruments of force). (5) In addition, his\ninsistence on respecting national groupings is accompanied by the\nstrongest denunciations of military conflict, colonial exploitation,\nand all other forms of harm between nations; a demand that nations\ninstead peacefully cooperate and compete in trade and intellectual\nendeavors for their mutual benefit; and a plea that they should indeed\nactively work to help each other.\n\nMoreover, Herder has compelling reasons for this insistence on\nrespecting national groupings: (1) The deep diversity of values\nbetween nations entails that homogenization is only a fantasy:\nnon-existent hitherto and impracticable for the future. (2) Such\ndiversity also entails that, to the extent that it is\npracticable, it cannot occur voluntarily but only through external\ncoercion. (3) In practice, attempts to achieve it, for example, by\nEuropean colonialism, are moreover coercive from, and subserve,\nulterior motives of domination and exploitation. (4) Furthermore, real\nnational variety is positively valuable, both as affording individuals\na vital sense of local belonging and in itself.\n\nIndeed, Herder\u2019s pluralist cosmopolitanism is an important and\nattractive alternative to the homogenizing forms of cosmopolitanism,\nbased on illusions concerning either the fact or the prospect of\nuniversally shared values, that have predominated since the\nEnlightenment and are still popular today, both among philosophers\n(especially in the Anglophone world) and in international political\norganizations such as the United Nations.\n\nAnother important part of Herder\u2019s political philosophy, which\nbears on both domestic and international politics, is his striking\npreference for an ideal of humanity over his age\u2019s\nideal of human rights. (For further details, see Section 5 of\nthe\n Supplementary Discussion.)\n\nNow that we have surveyed the various political ideals that make up\nHerder\u2019s political position, one final issue still needs to be\naddressed. It might still be objected that all of this does not yet\nreally amount to a political theory\u2014such as other\nphilosophers have provided, including some of Herder\u2019s\ncontemporaries in Germany. In a sense that is true, but\nphilosophically defensible; in another sense it is false.\n\nIt is true in the following sense. There is indeed no grand\nmetaphysical theory underpinning Herder\u2019s position\u2014no\nPlatonic theory of forms, no correlation of political institutions\nwith \u201cmoments\u201d in a Hegelian Logic, no\n\u201cdeduction\u201d of political institutions from the nature of\nthe self or the will \u00e0 la Fichte or Hegel, or whatnot. But that\nis quite deliberate, given Herder\u2019s skepticism about such\nmetaphysics. And is it not indeed philosophically a good thing?\n\nNor does Herder have any account purporting to justify the moral\nintuitions at work in his political position as a sort of theoretical\ninsight (in the manner of Kant\u2019s theory of the\n\u201ccategorical imperative\u201d or Rawls\u2019s theory of the\n\u201coriginal position\u201d, for example). But that is again quite\ndeliberate, given his sentimentalism in ethics, and his rejection of\nsuch theories as both false and harmful. And is he not again right\nabout this, and the absence of such an account therefore again a good\nthing?\n\nNor is Herder sympathetic with such tired staples of political theory\nas natural rights, the state of nature, the social contract, the\ngeneral will, and utopias for the future. But again, he has good\nspecific reasons for skepticism about these notions. So this again\nseems like a good thing.\n\nThis, then, is the sense in which the objection is correct; Herder\ndoes indeed lack a \u201cpolitical theory\u201d of these\nsorts. But he lacks it on principle, and is arguably quite\nright to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, in another sense it is false to say that he lacks a\n\u201cpolitical theory\u201d. For he does have a\n\u201cpolitical theory\u201d of a different, and arguably far more\nvaluable, sort. First, consistently with his general empiricism, his\nposition in political philosophy is deeply empirically informed. For\ninstance, as can be seen from the Dissertation on the Reciprocal\nInfluence of Government and the Sciences (1780), his thesis\nconcerning the importance of freedom of thought and expression, and\nthe competition between views that it makes possible, for producing\nintellectual progress is largely based on the positive historical\nexample of ancient Greece, and in particular Athens, as contrasted\nwith later societies, such as Rome, that lacked the freedom and\ncompetition in question and generated correspondingly weaker\nintellectual achievements. And in the 1792 draft of the Letters\nfor the Advancement he even describes the French Revolution and\nits attempts to establish a modern democracy as a sort of\n\u201cexperiment\u201d from which we can learn (for example, learn\nwhether democracy can be successfully extended to nations that are\nmuch larger than ancient Athens).\n\nSecond, in conformity with his general sentimentalism in ethics, he is\nacutely aware that his political position ultimately rests on moral\nsentiments\u2014his own and, for its success, other people\u2019s as\nwell. For example, in the 10th Collection of the\nLetters for the Advancement he emphasizes that people\u2019s\nmoral \u201cdispositions\u201d or \u201cfeelings\u201d play a\nfundamental role as essential supports for his political\nposition\u2019s realization. This standpoint absolves him of the need\nto do certain sorts of theorizing\u2014not only precluding any need\nfor cognitivist groundings of the moral intuitions in question, but\nalso promising short, effective solutions to various problems that\nwould no doubt look like real brain-teasers to a cognitivist. However,\nit also leads him to engage in theorizing of another sort, namely,\ntheorizing about the ways in which, and the causal means by which,\npeople\u2019s moral sentiments should be molded in order to realize\nthe ideals of his political position. His discussion of moral\n\u201cdispositions\u201d in the 10th Collection is an example of\nsuch theorizing\u2014concerning the ways in which, rather\nthan the causal means by which. Some of his extensive\ntheorizing about causal means (education, exemplary individuals, laws,\nliterature, and so on) has already been discussed earlier in this\narticle.\n\nThese two sorts of political theorizing\u2014empirical\ntheorizing and theorizing about moral sentiments\u2014are\ndeeply developed in Herder. And they are arguably much more pointful\nthan the sorts that are not.\n\nIn short, to the extent that Herder\u2019s political philosophy\nreally is theoretically superficial, it is, to borrow a phrase of\nNietzsche\u2019s, \u201csuperficial\u2014out of\nprofundity\u201d (whereas more familiar forms of political\nphilosophy are profound\u2014out of superficiality). And in another,\nmore important, sense it is not theoretically superficial at all.\n",
