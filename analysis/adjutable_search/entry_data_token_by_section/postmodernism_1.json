The Postmodern Condition\n\nThe term \u201cpostmodern\u201d came into the philosophical lexicon\nwith the publication of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard's La\nCondition Postmoderne in 1979 (in English: The Postmodern\nCondition: A Report on Knowledge, 1984), where he employs\nWittgenstein's model of language games (see Wittgenstein 1953) and\nconcepts taken from speech act theory to account for what he calls a\ntransformation of the game rules for science, art, and literature\nsince the end of the nineteenth century. He describes his text as a\ncombination of two very different language games, that of the\nphilosopher and that of the expert. Where the expert knows what he\nknows and what he doesn't know, the philosopher knows neither, but\nposes questions. In light of this ambiguity, Lyotard states that his\nportrayal of the state of knowledge \u201cmakes no claims to being\noriginal or even true,\u201d and that his hypotheses \u201cshould\nnot be accorded predictive value in relation to reality, but\nstrategic value in relation to the questions raised\u201d (Lyotard\n1984 [1979], 7).  The book, then, is as much an experiment in the\ncombination of language games as it is an objective\n\u201creport.\u201d\n\nOn Lyotard's account, the computer age has transformed knowledge into\ninformation, that is, coded messages within a system of transmission\nand communication. Analysis of this knowledge calls for a pragmatics\nof communication insofar as the phrasing of messages, their\ntransmission and reception, must follow rules in order to be accepted\nby those who judge them. However, as Lyotard points out, the position\nof judge or legislator is also a position within a language game, and\nthis raises the question of legitimation. As he insists, \u201cthere\nis a strict interlinkage between the kind of language called science\nand the kind called ethics and politics\u201d (Lyotard 1984 [1979],\n8), and this interlinkage constitutes the cultural perspective of the\nWest. Science is therefore tightly interwoven with government and\nadministration, especially in the information age, where enormous\namounts of capital and large installations are needed for\nresearch.\n\nLyotard points out that while science has sought to distinguish\nitself from narrative knowledge in the form of tribal wisdom\ncommunicated through myths and legends, modern philosophy has sought\nto provide legitimating narratives for science in the form of\n\u201cthe dialectics of Spirit, the hermeneutics of meaning, the\nemancipation of the rational or working subject, or the creation of\nwealth,\u201d (Lyotard 1984 [1979], xxiii). Science, however, plays\nthe language game of denotation to the exclusion of all others, and\nin this respect it displaces narrative knowledge, including the\nmeta-narratives of philosophy. This is due, in part, to what Lyotard\ncharacterizes as the rapid growth of technologies and techniques in\nthe second half of the twentieth century, where the emphasis of\nknowledge has shifted from the ends of human action to its means\n(Lyotard 1984 [1979], 37). This has eroded the speculative game of\nphilosophy and set each science free to develop independently of\nphilosophical grounding or systematic organization. \u201cI\ndefine postmodern as incredulity toward\nmeta-narratives,\u201d says Lyotard (Lyotard 1984 [1979], xxiv). As\na result, new, hybrid disciplines develop without connection to old\nepistemic traditions, especially philosophy, and this means science\nonly plays its own game and cannot legitimate others, such as moral\nprescription.\n\nThe compartmentalization of knowledge and the dissolution of\nepistemic coherence is a concern for researchers and philosophers\nalike. As Lyotard notes, \u201cLamenting the \u2018loss of\nmeaning\u2019 in postmodernity boils down to mourning the fact that\nknowledge is no longer principally narrative\u201d (Lyotard 1984\n[1979], 26). Indeed, for Lyotard, the de-realization of the world\nmeans the disintegration of narrative elements into\n\u201cclouds\u201d of linguistic combinations and collisions among\ninnumerable, heterogeneous language games.  Furthermore, within each\ngame the subject moves from position to position, now as sender, now\nas addressee, now as referent, and so on. The loss of a continuous\nmeta-narrative therefore breaks the subject into heterogeneous\nmoments of subjectivity that do not cohere into an identity. But as\nLyotard points out, while the combinations we experience are not\nnecessarily stable or communicable, we learn to move with a certain\nnimbleness among them.\n\nPostmodern sensibility does not lament the loss of narrative\ncoherence any more than the loss of being. However, the dissolution\nof narrative leaves the field of legitimation to a new unifying\ncriterion: the performativity of the knowledge-producing system whose\nform of capital is information. Performative legitimation means\nmaximizing the flow of information and minimizing static\n(non-functional moves) in the system, so whatever cannot be\ncommunicated as information must be eliminated. The performativity\ncriterion threatens anything not meeting its requirements, such as\nspeculative narratives, with de-legitimation and\nexclusion. Nevertheless, capital also demands the continual\nre-invention of the \u201cnew\u201d in the form of new language\ngames and new denotative statements, and so, paradoxically, a\ncertain paralogy is required by the system itself. In this\nregard, the modern paradigm of progress as new moves under\nestablished rules gives way to the postmodern paradigm of inventing\nnew rules and changing the game.\n\nInventing new codes and reshaping information is a large part of the\nproduction of knowledge, and in its inventive moment science does not\nadhere to performative efficiency. By the same token, the\nmeta-prescriptives of science, its rules, are themselves objects of\ninvention and experimentation for the sake of producing new\nstatements. In this respect, says Lyotard, the model of knowledge as\nthe progressive development of consensus is outmoded. In fact,\nattempts to retrieve the model of consensus can only repeat the\nstandard of coherence demanded for functional efficiency, and they\nwill thus lend themselves to the domination of capital. On the other\nhand, the paralogical inventiveness of science raises the possibility\nof a new sense of justice, as well as knowledge, as we move among the\nlanguage games now entangling us.\n\nLyotard takes up the question of justice in Just Gaming (see\nLyotard 1985 [1979]) and The Differend: Phrases in\nDispute (see Lyotard 1988 [1983]), where he combines the model\nof language games with Kant's division of the faculties\n(understanding, imagination, reason) and types of judgment\n(theoretical, practical, aesthetic) in order to explore the problem\nof justice set out in The Postmodern Condition. Without the\nformal unity of the subject, the faculties are set free to operate on\ntheir own. Where Kant insists that reason must assign domains and\nlimits to the other faculties, its dependence upon the unity of the\nsubject for the identity of concepts as laws or rules de-legitimizes\nits juridical authority in the postmodern age. Instead, because we\nare faced with an irreducible plurality of judgments and\n\u201cphrase regimes,\u201d the faculty of judgment itself is\nbrought to the fore. Kant's third Critique therefore\nprovides the conceptual materials for Lyotard's analysis, especially\nthe analytic of aesthetic judgment (see Kant 1790).\n\nAs Lyotard argues, aesthetic judgment is the appropriate model for\nthe problem of justice in postmodern experience because we are\nconfronted with a plurality of games and rules without a concept\nunder which to unify them. Judgment must therefore be reflective\nrather than determining. Furthermore, judgment must be aesthetic\ninsofar as it does not produce denotative knowledge about a\ndeterminable state of affairs, but refers to the way our faculties\ninteract with each other as we move from one mode of phrasing to\nanother, i.e. the denotative, the prescriptive, the performative, the\npolitical, the cognitive, the artistic, etc. In Kantian terms, this\ninteraction registers as an aesthetic feeling. Where Kant emphasizes\nthe feeling of the beautiful as a harmonious interaction between\nimagination and understanding, Lyotard stresses the mode in which\nfaculties (imagination and reason,) are in disharmony, i.e. the\nfeeling of the sublime. For Kant, the sublime occurs when our\nfaculties of sensible presentation are overwhelmed by impressions of\nabsolute power and magnitude, and reason is thrown back upon its own\npower to conceive Ideas (such as the moral law) which surpass the\nsensible world. For Lyotard, however, the postmodern sublime occurs\nwhen we are affected by a multitude of unpresentables without\nreference to reason as their unifying origin. Justice, then, would\nnot be a definable rule, but an ability to move and judge among rules\nin their heterogeneity and multiplicity. In this respect, it would be\nmore akin to the production of art than a moral judgment in Kant's\nsense.\n\nIn \u201cWhat is Postmodernism?,\u201d which appears as an appendix\nto the English edition of The Postmodern Condition, Lyotard\naddresses the importance of avant-garde art in terms of the aesthetic\nof the sublime. Modern art, he says, is emblematic of a sublime\nsensibility, that is, a sensibility that there is something\nnon-presentable demanding to be put into sensible form and yet\noverwhelms all attempts to do so. But where modern art presents the\nunpresentable as a missing content within a beautiful form, as in\nMarcel Proust, postmodern art, exemplified by James Joyce, puts\nforward the unpresentable by forgoing beautiful form itself, thus\ndenying what Kant would call the consensus of taste. Furthermore,\nsays Lyotard, a work can become modern only if it is first\npostmodern, for postmodernism is not modernism at its end but in its\nnascent state, that is, at the moment it attempts to present the\nunpresentable, \u201cand this state is constant\u201d (Lyotard 1984\n[1979], 79). The postmodern, then, is a repetition of the modern as\nthe \u201cnew,\u201d and this means the ever-new demand for another\nrepetition.\n",
