    "main_text": "A New Metaphysics and Epistemology || How do our minds know?\n3.1 How do our minds know?\n\nDescartes had no doubt that human beings know some things and are\ncapable of discovering others, including (at least since his\nmetaphysical insights of 1629) fundamental truths about the basic\nstructure of reality. Yet he also believed that the philosophical\nmethods taught in the schools and used by most of his contemporaries\nwere deeply flawed. Accordingly, the doctrines of scholastic\nAristotelian philosophy contained a basic error about how fundamental\ntruths, such as those in metaphysics, are obtained. He articulated\nthis error in the First Meditation, by saying (not in his own voice,\nbut in that of the reader): \u201cWhatever I have up till now\naccepted as most true I have acquired either from the senses or\nthrough the senses\u201d (7:18). He then challenged the veridicality\nof the senses with the skeptical arguments of the First Meditation,\nincluding the dream argument (that we might experience sensory images\nwhile dreaming that are indistinguishable from waking experience) and\nthe argument that a deceptive God or an evil deceiver is causing our\nsensory experience or causes us to err even when reasoning.\n\nIn the Aristotelian scheme against which Descartes was moving, all\nknowledge arises through the senses, in accordance with the slogan\n\u201cThere is nothing in the intellect that was not previously in\nthe senses\u201d (7:75, 267). Similarly, orthodox scholastic\nAristotelians agreed that there is \u201cno thought without a\nphantasm,\u201d or an image. Descartes explained these convictions as\nthe results of childhood prejudice (7:2, 17, 69, 107; Princ.\nI.71\u20133). As children, we are naturally led by our senses in\nseeking benefits and avoiding bodily harms. As a result, when we grow\ninto adults we are \u201cimmersed\u201d in the body and the senses,\nand so we accept the philosophical view that the senses reveal the\nnature of reality (7:38, 75, 82\u20133).\n\nAlthough Descartes ultimately accepted the senses as a source of some\nkinds of knowledge, he denied that they reveal the natures of\nsubstances (7:83). Rather, the human intellect perceives the nature of\nreality through purely intellectual perception. This means that, in\norder to procure the fundamental truths of metaphysics, we must\n\u201cwithdraw the mind from the senses\u201d (7:4, 12, 14) and turn\ntoward our innate ideas of the essences of things, including the\nessences of mind, matter, and an infinite being (God). Descartes\nconstructed the Meditations so as to secure this process of\nwithdrawal from the senses in Meditation I. Meditation II discovers an\ninitial truth, the cogito (7:25), elsewhere summarized as the\nargument \u201ccogito, ergo sum,\u201d or \u201cI think, therefore\nI am\u201d (7:140). The cogito result is known with\ncertainty because it is \u201cclearly and distinctly\u201d perceived\nby the intellect (7:35). Clear and distinct intellectual perception,\nindependent of the senses, is, then, the mark of truth (7:35, 62,\n73).\n\nDescartes unfolds a sequence of clear and distinct perception in\nMeditations III\u2013VI and again in Principles I\u2013II.\nWe consider these results in Secs. 3.3\u20133.5. For now, let us\nexamine Descartes\u2019 thoughts about the senses as a source of\nknowledge, different from pure intellect.\n\nDescartes\u2019 conclusion in Meditation VI that the senses do not\nreveal the \u201cessential nature\u201d of external objects (7:83)\ndiffers from his position in the Rules. In that work, he\nallowed that some \u201csimple natures\u201d pertaining to corporeal\nthings can be known through the images of the senses (10:383, 417). In\nthe Meditations, he held that the essence of matter is\napprehended by innate ideas, independently of any sensory image\n(7:64\u20135, 72\u20133). To that extent, his position\npost-Rules agrees with the Platonic tradition in philosophy.\nBut Plato denigrated the senses as a source of knowledge. Descartes\nwas not a full-blown Platonist in that he did not totally disparage\nsensory knowledge.\n\nDescartes assigned two roles to the senses in the acquisition of human\nknowledge. First, he acknowledged that the senses are usually adequate\nfor detecting benefits and harms for the body. Their natural function\nis \u201cto inform the mind of what is beneficial or harmful for the\ncomposite of which the mind is a part\u201d (7:83), that is, for the\ncomposite of mind and body. Here, he adopted a widely held conception\nof sensory function within natural philosophy, also found in the\nAristotelian and medical literatures.\n\nSecond, he acknowledged an essential role for the senses in natural\nphilosophy. Older interpretive literature sometimes has Descartes\nclaiming to derive all natural philosophical or scientific knowledge\nfrom the pure intellect, independent of the senses. But Descartes knew\nfull well that he could not do that. He distinguished between the\ngeneral principles of his physics and the more particular mechanisms\nby which he explained natural phenomena such as magnetism or the\nproperties of oil and water. He claimed to derive the general\nprinciples \u201cfrom certain seeds of truth\u201d that are innate\nin the mind (Disc. 6:64). These include the fundamental\ndoctrine that the essence of matter is extension (Princ.\nII.3\u20134, IV.203). For particular phenomena, he relied on\nobservations to determine their properties (such as the properties of\nthe magnet), and he acknowledged that multiple hypotheses about\nsubvisible mechanisms could be constructed to account for those\nphenomena. The natural philosopher must, therefore, test the various\nhypotheses by their consequences, and consider empirical virtues such\nas simplicity and scope (Disc. VI; Princ.\nIV.201\u20136). Further, Descartes knew that some problems require\nmeasurements that rely on the senses, including determining the size\nof the sun (Med. 7:80, Princ. III.5\u20136) or the\nrefractive indexes of various materials (Met. VIII).\n\nAlthough Descartes recognized an important role for the senses in\nnatural philosophy, he limited that role by comparison with\nAristotelian epistemology. Many scholastic Aristotelians held that all\nintellectual content arises through a process of intellectual\nabstraction that starts from sensory images found in the faculty of\nimagination. Mathematical objects are formed by abstraction from such\nimages. Even metaphysics rests on knowledge derived by abstraction\nfrom images. Of course, they held that the intellect plays a crucial\nrole in abstracting mathematical objects or the essences of natural\nthings. By contrast, Descartes affirmed that the truths of mathematics\nand metaphysics are grasped by the pure intellect operating\nindependently of the senses and without assistance from the\nimagination.\n\nAs regards knowledge, Descartes accepted that in order to know\nsomething you must not only represent it as true (e.g., \u201cthe\nessence of matter is extension\u201d), but you must also affirm its\ntruth and do so with some justification. In his scheme of mental\ncapacities, the intellect, as the faculty of representation, offers\ncontent for judgment. A second mental faculty, the will (Med.\nIV, Princ. I.32\u20134), affirms or denies the truth of that\ncontent (e.g., asserts that the essence of matter is extension).\n\nNot all content deriving from the intellectual faculty is\n\u201cpure.\u201d Purely intellectual content arises from innate\nideas without any accompanying brain processes. Other intellectual\nacts require the presence of the body: sense perception, imagination,\nand corporeal (body-involving) memory. The content of these acts is\nless clear and distinct than that of pure intellect, and may indeed be\nobscure and confused (as in the case of color sensations).\nNonetheless, the will can affirm or deny such intellectual content.\nWith clear and distinct purely intellectual perceptions, the will is\njustified in affirming their truth. (As discussed in the next\nsubsection, no error can arise in these judgments.) For lesser degrees\nof clarity and distinctness, care must be taken in what the will\naffirms (Med. IV, Princ. I.66\u201370,\nIV.205\u20136). (See Newman 2019.)\n\nIn sum, in considering Descartes\u2019 answer to how we know, classes\nof knowledge differ in the degree of expected certainty. Metaphysical\nfirst principles as known by the intellect acting alone should attain\nabsolute certainty. Practical knowledge concerning immediate benefits\nand harms is known by the senses. Such knowledge needn\u2019t attain\nabsolute certainty; even so, it is usually accurate enough. Objects of\nnatural science are known by a combination of pure intellect and\nsensory observation: the pure intellect tells us what properties\nbodies can have, and we use the senses to determine which particular\ninstances of those properties bodies do have. For submicroscopic\nparticles, we must reason from observed effects to potential cause. In\nthese cases, our measurements and our inferences may be subject to\nerror, but with care we may hope to arrive at the truth.\n",
