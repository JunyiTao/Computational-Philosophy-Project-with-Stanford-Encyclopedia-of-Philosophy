    "main_text": "Categories and Universals || Natures and Individuation\n4.3 Natures and Individuation\n\nThe genus and species concepts that we find in the categories are what\nmediaeval philosophers took to be universals, which following\nAristotle they unanimously agreed are what is \u201cpredicable of\nmany\u201d (On Interpretation 7, 17a38\u2013b1). No one\ndisagreed that the term \u2018humanity\u2019 was predicable of many\nparticular human beings. The pressing metaphysical question was rather\nwhether there is a property of being-human, i.e. humanity, that all\nsingular human beings share or not, which would explain why it is true\nto say that Plato and Socrates, for instance, are human beings. The\nrealist holds that there is some kind of universal entity \u2013 a\nrepeatable and instantiable property \u2013 that all the particular\nentities or members of some kind exemplify. But since it is obvious\nthat Socrates and Plato are both human beings and yet that each is a\nsingular, individual entity, the realist also has to give some account\nof how the property of being-human is individuated so as to constitute\nSocrates on the one hand and Plato on the other. The nominalist, by\ncontrast, denies that any such universal entity exists, holding\ninstead that all entities are just particular.\n\nChatton wades into the debate between Scotus, a realist, and Ockham, a\nnominalist, most extensively in Lectura d. 2, q. 5, defending\nScotus\u2019 position against Ockham\u2019s unrelenting attack\ncontained in the latter\u2019s Ordinatio d. 2, q. 6. We see\nthat Chatton adopts Scotus\u2019 basic picture of the metaphysical\nstructure of substances, both immaterial substances like angels and\nmaterial substances like human beings, cats, and trees. In each case,\nthe particular entities of a given kind, for instance each and every\nhuman being, are constituted by various natures \u2013 humanity,\nanimality, etc. \u2013 and what Chatton calls an \u2018individual\nproperty.\u2019 Also known as a haecceity, the individual property\nof, say Socrates, is what individuates each substantial and accidental\nnature such that they are Socrates\u2019s humanity,\nanimality, whiteness, etc. and not Plato\u2019s, who has his own\nindividual property that makes his humanity, animality, whiteness. his\nown. The nature of humanity as such is a repeatable and instantiable\nproperty but as individuated, Socrates\u2019s humanity is not; it is\nutterly individual and singular. Scotus thought, and Chatton\nemphasizes this in the face of Ockham\u2019s conviction that every\nthing is radically particular, that natures never exist as such out\nthere in external reality. Natures either exist in extra-mental\nreality as individuated and singular, Socrates\u2019s humanity and\nPlato\u2019s humanity each being numerically one and distinct from\none another, or natures exist in the mind as universal concepts where\nthey are indeed predicable of many.\n\nChatton insists that despite the fact that Socrates\u2019s humanity\ncan only exist as individuated, as Socrates\u2019s humanity and no\none else\u2019s, nonetheless if taken as such and in abstraction from\nits instantiation in Socrates, humanity is the sort of thing for which\nit is not contradictory to be instantiated by another individual, like\nPlato. The reason, he thinks, is that the definition of\nSocrates\u2019s humanity, definable as \u2018rational animal\u2019,\nis intrinsically general, containing no reference to Socrates\nthat would restrict its signification to his and only his humanity. If\nSocrates\u2019s humanity were intrinsically particular to him, its\ndefinition would have to be something like \u2018this rational\nanimal\u2019 pointing at Socrates. Yet, this cannot be the case for\nthe simple reason that human beings other than Socrates exist and each\nof their humanities is likewise definable as \u2018rational\nanimal\u2019 and not \u2018this rational animal\u2019.\n\nThe upshot of this is that there must be some kind of distinction\nwithin Socrates between his humanity as it is definable by its\nspecific definition and his individual property (e.g.,\nLectura 2, d. 5, paragraph 24). In light of this distinction,\nit is, then, not contradictory (Chatton uses the expression \u201cnot\nrepugnant to\u201d) to Socrates\u2019s humanity to be Plato\u2019s\neven though it is in fact impossible for Socrates\u2019s humanity to\nbe Plato\u2019s. This complicated line of counter-factual reasoning\nfinds its inspiration in Scotus but takes centre-stage in\nChatton\u2019s discussion of natures and individuation. It is not\nrepugnant to natures, taken as such, to be instantiated by multiple\nparticular entities of the same kind at once. It is repugnant to\nnatures, as individuated, to be instantiated by multiple particular\nentities of the same kind at once.\n\nIt should now be clear what Chatton means when he says that an\nindividual is in a category. Socrates is the individual res\nwhose species concept \u2013 \u2018human being\u2019 \u2013 is\nessentially predicated by all the genus concepts within its given\ncategorial line \u2013 \u2018animal,\u2019 \u2018body,\u2019\n\u2018substance\u2019 \u2013 and he is nothing but a set of\nindividuated natures. Similarly, the whiteness that inheres in\nSocrates, whose specific concept \u2018whiteness\u2019 is\nessentially predicated by \u2018colour,\u2019 \u2018sensible\nquality,\u2019 \u2018quality\u2019 is an individuated nature.\nIndividuals, or rather individuated natures, fall into the ten basic\nclasses of things that are signified by category concepts.\n",
