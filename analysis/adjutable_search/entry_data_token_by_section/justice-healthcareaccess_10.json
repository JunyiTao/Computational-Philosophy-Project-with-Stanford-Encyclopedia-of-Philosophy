    "main_text": "What Kinds of Health Care Do We Owe Each Other?\n5. Is There a Right to Health or Health Care?\n\nIf health care were the only or most important determinant of\npopulation health, then an opportunity-based account of justice and\nhealth would be right to focus solely on a right to health care and to\nignore the more contentious and possibly misleading right claim to\nhealth. A right to health care would then be a special case of a right\nto fair equality of opportunity. Such a right to health care is\nproperly understood as system-relative. The entitlements it involves\nare contingent claims to an array of health care services that protect\nfair shares of the opportunity range under reasonable resource\nconstraints.\n\nThis simple picture of a right to health care must be modified in two\nways to accommodate points already made in our discussion. First,\nsince the category of socially controllable factors determining\npopulation health and its distribution is clearly broader than health\ncare alone (even if we include traditional public health measures\nwithin the domain of health care), the point of claiming a right to\nhealth cannot simply be to claim that others owe us certain kinds of\nhealth care. Does this give us more reason to talk about a right to\nhealth? Second, whatever sense we can make out of a right to health\n(or health care), the specific entitlements it involves cannot be\ndetermined except through a fair deliberative process. Consider these\nmodifications in turn.\n\nIf health needs are broader than needs for health care, should we try\nto make sense of a right to health? We face an immediate and serious\nobjection. The expression \u201cright to health\u201d appears to\nembody confusion about the kind of thing that can be the object of a\nright claim. Health is an inappropriate object, whereas health care\nis. If our poor health is not the result of anyone\u2019s doing, or\nfailing to do, something for us or to us that might have prevented, or\nmight cure, our condition, then it is hard to see how any right of\nours is violated.\n\nPeople who claim a right to health may mean something less troubling.\nThey should be understood to be claiming that certain individuals or\ngroups or society as a whole are obliged to perform various actions,\nsuch as designing certain institutions and distributing important\ngoods in certain ways that promote or maintain or restore their\nhealth, and they are obliged to refrain from actions that interfere\nwith it. The reference to health should be construed as a\nhandy way to characterize functionally the relevant,\nsocially-controllable actions, namely those that affect population\nhealth and its distribution. This gloss on the meaning of a right to\nhealth broadens the range of actions from the provision of health care\nto the meeting of the broader set of health needs that arises when we\ngrasp the broader determinants of health. This gloss allows us to see\nwhy some advocates, for example of a human right to health, have\ninsisted on a \u201cright to health\u201d and not just on a\n\u201cright to (certain) health care services.\u201d They want, and\nreasonably so, the right to imply that there are obligations to\nperform a broad range of actions that affect health, even if these\nactions are not normally construed as health care services and even if\nthey involve factors outside the health sector, however broadly\nconstrued. The gloss makes it clear, however, that a right to health,\nso understood, is not violated when there has been a just distribution\nof the socially controllable factors affecting health, yet health\nfails anyway. Consequently, we do not have to denounce as confused\nthose who claim a right to have the full range of their health needs\nmet.\n\nJust what entitlements follow from a right to have a broad set of\nhealth needs met is system relative and depends on resource allocation\ndecisions that are made in a fair deliberative process. To see the\npoint, consider an objection sometimes made to the narrower claim to a\nright to health care, namely Fried\u2019s (1978) objection that an\nindividual right to health care invites falling into a\n\u201cbottomless pit.\u201d Fried is worried that if we posit a\nfundamental individual right to have needs satisfied, no other social\ngoals will be able to override the right claims to all health-care\nneeds.\n\nNo such fundamental right to have specific needs met is directly\nposited on the view sketched here. Rather, the particular rights and\nentitlements of individuals to have certain needs met are specified\nonly as a result of a fair deliberative process aimed at meeting\npopulation health needs fairly. Typically, not all health needs can be\nmet under reasonable resource constraints. Deciding which needs should\nactually be met and what resources are to be devoted to doing\nso\u2014both within and outside the health sector\u2014requires\ncareful moral judgment and a wealth of empirical knowledge about the\neffects of alternative allocations. The right to health can yield\nentitlements only to those needs that it is reasonable to try to\nmeet.\n\nThis restriction on how we specify the content of the right to health\nmeans, for example, that we cannot directly infer from (a) the moral\nfact that Jack has a right to health care and (b) the empirical fact\nthat an experimental pancreas transplant offers him his only chance at\nsurvival that (c) Jack is entitled to that intervention. Jack\u2019s\nmedical entitlements\u2014given his right\u2014depend both on his\ncondition and on the array of interventions it is reasonable to\nprovide the population of which he is a member. That reasonable array\nin turn depends on what we know is effective, what resources we have,\nand what priority should be given to meeting his need compared to that\nof others. If pancreas transplants are of unproven efficacy, or if\ntheir cost or cost-effectiveness makes including them in a benefit\npackage unreasonable, given what else it would be better to include,\nthen coverage for such transplants may be denied for Jack and others.\nAlthough a moral right to health is grounded in the general idea that\nwe have obligations to protect opportunity by promoting normal\nfunctioning, its specific content is in this fundamental way\nsystem-relative.\n\nWe noted earlier some dimensions of the limit setting that must go on.\nThe various institutions that affect opportunity must be weighed\nagainst each other. Similarly, the resources required to provide for\nfair equality of opportunity must be weighed against what is needed to\nprovide for other important social institutions. This is true even\nthough guaranteeing fair equality of opportunity has (lexical or\nstrict) priority over principles of justice promoting wellbeing in\nother ways, at least within Rawls\u2019s theory of justice as\nfairness. The point is that institutions, including health care\ninstitutions, capable of protecting opportunity can be maintained only\nin societies whose productive capacities they do not undermine. The\nbugaboo of the bottomless pit is less threatening in the context of\nsuch a theory. The price paid is that we are less clear, in general\nand abstracting from the application of the theory to a particular\nsociety, just what the individual claim comes to.\n\nThe right to health must be system relative for another reason that is\nimplied by a deeper feature of the opportunity-based account. What is\nspecial about meeting health needs, for purposes of justice, is that\nit contributes to protecting individuals\u2019 fair shares of the\nnormal opportunity range for their society. That range, to emphasize\nthe point, is society relative. This relativity, however, then also\ninfects claims about what we are entitled to when a health system is\ndesigned for a specific society. The relativization of the normal\nrange to a society captures an important requirement for a theory of\njust health care. It is not a feature we should lightly abandon. The\nimportance of meeting specific health needs will vary depending on\nfacts about a society, and a distributive principle must leave room\nfor such variation. Curing dyslexia might well be more important in\nsome societies than others, though it is an instance of pathology in\nall of them. (Suppose a disease is widespread, even universal, in a\nsociety. Say it is a form of anemia that affects all and is\ndebilitating across the board. One might think that impact on the\nnormal opportunity range will not tell us how important it is to treat\nthis disease, since it hurts all individuals equally. But the\nopportunity account still helps us here, for it is not only a\nprinciple governing competitive advantage. The anemia in this case is\na disease which keeps each individual from adequately carrying out any\nlife plan that otherwise would be reasonable in his society. Remember,\nthe reference point is normal species-functioning, not simply\nfunctioning in a certain society.)\n\nConsider the claim that it is a matter for the courts to decide what\nshould be included in a right to health or health care. In some\ncountries, such a right is embodied in the constitution of the\ncountry. In Colombia, for example, the public has been encouraged to\nfile law suits, called tutelas, some of which are aimed at compelling\ninsurance schemes to cover services that should be covered (by law) in\nthe benefit package and some of which aim to expand coverage for the\nplaintiff to include a service not part of the defined benefit\npackage. Further, all signatories to international treaties that\nrecognize a human right to health are legally bound to recognize that\nright, and arguably, their courts should play a role in doing so. We\nmight distinguish two roles of the courts. One uncontroversial role\nwould be to insist that the delegated authorities (the ministry of\nhealth) specify the criteria and the process used to define the\nbenefit package, and then exercise judicial review of whether specific\ndecisions are made through that process that use those criteria. A\nmore controversial role would be for the courts to try to determine\nmore directly what should be included in a right to health. To perform\nthe latter task, the courts would need to know many things about the\ncapability of the health system to sustainably deliver a particular\nservice in light of competing claims on services, that is on\nresources. If the courts are not in a position to play that role, then\nthey should restrict their task to making sure that the ministry of\nhealth performs that task according to an acceptable process.\n\nWe shall conclude by considering how equal must our rights to health\nor health care be? Specifically, must everyone receive exactly the\nsame kinds of health-care services and coverage, or is fairness in\nhealth care compatible with a \u2018tiered\u2019 system? Around the\nworld, even countries that offer universal health insurance differ in\ntheir answers to this question. In Canada, for example, no\nsupplementary insurance is permitted. Everyone is served solely by the\nnational health-insurance schemes, though people who seek additional\nservices or more rapid service may go elsewhere, as some Canadians do\nby crossing the border. In Britain, supplementary private insurance\nallows about 10 per cent of the population to gain quicker access to\nservices for which there is extensive queuing in the public system.\nBasing a right to health care on an obligation to protect equality of\nopportunity is compatible with the sort of tiering the British have,\nbut it does not require it, and it imposes some constraints on the\nkind of tiering allowed.\n\nThe primary social obligation is to assure everyone access to a tier\nof services that effectively promotes normal functioning and thus\nprotects equality of opportunity. Since health care is not the only\nimportant good, resources to be invested in the basic tier are\nappropriately and reasonably limited, for example, by democratic\ndecisions about how much to invest in education or job training as\nopposed to health care. Because of their very high \u201copportunity\ncosts,\u201d there will be some beneficial medical services that it\nwill be reasonable not to provide in the basic tier, or to provide\nonly on a limited basis, for example, with queuing. To say that these\nservices have \u201chigh opportunity costs\u201d means that\nproviding them consumes resources that would produce greater health\nbenefits and protect opportunity more if used in other ways.\n\nIn a society that permits significant income and wealth inequalities,\nsome people will want to buy coverage for these additional services.\nWhy not let them? After all, we allow people to use their after-tax\nincome and wealth as they see fit to pursue the quality of life and\nopportunities they prefer. The rich can buy special security systems\nfor their homes. They can buy safer cars. They can buy private\nschooling for their children. Why not allow them to buy supplementary\nhealth care for their families?\n\nOne objection to allowing a supplementary tier is that its existence\nmight undermine the basic tier either economically or politically. It\nmight attract better-quality providers away from the basic tier, or\nraise costs in the basic tier, reducing the ability of society to meet\nits social obligations. The supplementary tier might undermine\npolitical support for the basic tier, for example, by undercutting the\nsocial solidarity needed if people are to remain committed to\nprotecting opportunity for all. These objections are serious, and\nwhere a supplementary tier undermines the basic tier in either way,\neconomically or politically, priority must be given to protecting the\nbasic tier. In principle, however, it seems possible to design a\nsystem in which the supplementary tier does not undermine the basic\none. If that can be done, then a system that permits tiering avoids\nrestricting liberty in ways that some find seriously\nobjectionable.\n\nA second objection is not to tiering itself but to the structure of\ninequality that results. Compare two scenarios. In one, most people\nare adequately served by the basic tier and only the best-off groups\nin society have the means and see the need to purchase supplementary\ninsurance. That is the case in Great Britain. In the other, the basic\ntier serves only the poorest groups in society and most other people\nbuy supplementary insurance. The Oregon plan to expand Medicaid\neligibility partly through rationing the services it covers has\naspects of this structure of inequality, since most people are covered\nby plans that avoid these restrictions (Daniels, 1991). The first\nscenario seems preferable to the second on grounds of fairness. In the\nsecond, the poorest groups can complain that they are left behind by\nothers in society even in the protection of their health. In the\nfirst, the majority has fewer grounds for reasonable resentment or\nregret.\n\nIf the basic tier is not undermined by higher tiers, and if the\nstructure of the inequality that results is not objectionable, then it\nis difficult to see why some tiering should not be allowed. There is a\nbasic conflict here between concerns about equality and concerns about\nliberty, between wanting to make sure everyone is treated properly\nwith regard to health care and wanting to give people the liberty to\nuse their resources (after tax) to improve their lives as they see\nfit. In practice, the crucial constraint on the liberty we allow\npeople seems to depend on the magnitude of the benefit available in\nthe supplementary tier and unavailable in the basic tier. Highly\nvisible forms of saving lives and improving function would be\ndifficult to exclude from the basic tier while we make them available\nin a supplementary tier. In principle, however, some forms of tiering\nwill not be unfair even when they involve medical benefits not\navailable to everyone.\n",
