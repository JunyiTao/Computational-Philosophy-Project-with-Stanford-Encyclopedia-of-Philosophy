    "main_text": "Narrative Identity and the Turn to Selfhood\n6. Memory, History, Forgetting\n\nAll these threads in Ricoeur\u2019s philosophy come together in\nRicoeur\u2019s last big book (Memory, History, Forgetting,\n2004) pointing to the final revised lectures on recognition. This\nthree part work first takes up the question of memory and recollection\nin response to questions about uses and abuses of memory in\ncontemporary society. Ricoeur lists these as occurring on a\npathological-therapeutic level as the problem of blocked memory; on a\npractical level as manipulated memory, and on an ethical-political\nlevel as obligated memory. He then asks whether history is a remedy\nfor or a hindrance to these problems. This leads him back to the\nquestion of the epistemology of historical research and writing, a\ntopic he already had addressed in History and Truth (1965)\nand Time and Narrative. Now the question is to what extent\nhistory depends on memory. Historians know more about the past than\nindividuals remember, but can history completely break with an appeal\nto memory as a kind of testimony? I was there, believe me. The problem\nhere is suspicion not simply falsification. What is new to\nRicoeur\u2019s account is that he sees at work a closer tie between\nexplanation and understanding than he had considered in his earlier\nwork where explanation aids understanding. He now speaks of what he\ncalls explanatory understanding. It runs through what, following the\nFrench historian Michel de Certeau, he now calls the historiographical\noperation that characterizes the whole process of historical\ndocumentation, research, and writing. This shift in Ricoeur\u2019s\nthinking leads him to consider the question of historical\nrepresentation as an image based on both narration and rhetoric.\nHistory as written, he suggests, \u201cstands for\u201d the past as\n\u201chaving been\u201d.\n\nOn this basis, he can again ask about human existence as historical,\nas being within time and ultimately uncanny. He seeks particularly to\naddress the problem of forgetting in relation to the three problems\nlisted earlier. Traces of the past can be lost, and that past will be\nforgotten in the sense of being beyond memory. But what of forgetting\nwhere the traces remain? Here is where the problems of blocked,\nmanipulated, or commanded memory remain, especially in the latter case\nwith attempts to order forgetting either through amnesty or\ncensorship. This problem leads to an epilogue on the possibility of\nforgiveness, something Ricoeur admits is left incomplete. Along the\nway though, he shows that the idea of guilt, historical guilt\nnecessarily runs up against the limit of the imprescriptible and that\nforgiveness, which is difficult but not impossible, is something like\na gift, one that unbinds the agent from the act. Beyond the\ndistinction of a happy memory and an unhappy one in other words lies\nthe possibility of a forgetting held in reserve. To forgive is not to\nforget. It is this idea of forgiveness as a gift, but not one\nrequiring or expecting a gift in return but as something received and\npassed on as a second gift that leads the discussion of mutual\nrecognition and states of peace in Ricoeur\u2019s last book, The\nCourse of Recognition.\n\nRicoeur\u2019s argument there starts from the surprising fact that\nthere has been no recognized theory of recognition similar to what\nexists for theories of knowledge. In fact, when he looks in the\ndictionary he finds that the word (which in French carries as strong a\nsense of gratitude as of what English calls recognition), the word has\nnumerous lexical senses. Ricoeur therefore proposes to construct a\nchain of conceptual meanings that runs from recognition in the active\nvoice to its use in the passive voice, to being recognized. The demand\nfor recognition that runs through this sequence can only be answered,\nhe claims, by mutual recognition, \u201cwhere this mutual recognition\neither remains an unfulfilled dream or requires procedures and\ninstitutions that elevate recognition beyond the friendship of\nface-to-face relations to the political plane\u201d (The Course\nof Recognition, 19). This sequence of concepts of recognition\nruns from identifying something to identifying oneself to recognizing\nand being recognized by others. In the process the concept moves away\nfrom simply being identified with knowledge. Instead it opens the way\nto knowledge as it relates to self-knowledge and genuine community for\nwhich one is and can be grateful in that recognition \u201clightens\nthe weight of obligation to give in return and reorients this toward a\ngenerosity equal to the one that led to the first gift [of being\nrecognized]\u201d (243).\n",
