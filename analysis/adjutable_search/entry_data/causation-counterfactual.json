    "main_text": "\n1. Lewis\u2019s 1973 Counterfactual Analysis\n\nThe guiding idea behind counterfactual analyses of causation is the\nthought that \u2013 as David Lewis puts it \u2013 \u201cWe think of\na cause as something that makes a difference, and the difference it\nmakes must be a difference from what would have happened without it.\nHad it been absent, its effects \u2013 some of them, at least, and\nusually all \u2013 would have been absent as well\u201d (1973b,\n161).\n\nThe first explicit definition of causation in terms of counterfactuals\nwas, surprisingly enough, given by Hume, when he wrote: \u201cWe may\ndefine a cause to be an object followed by another, and where all\nthe objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to\nthe second. Or, in other words, where, if the first object had\nnot been, the second never had existed\u201d (1748, Section VII).\nIt is difficult to understand how Hume could have confused the first,\nregularity definition with the second, very different counterfactual\ndefinition (though see Buckle 2004: 212\u201313 for a brief\ndiscussion).\n\nAt any rate, Hume never explored the alternative counterfactual\napproach to causation. In this, as in much else, he was followed by\ngenerations of empiricist philosophers. The chief obstacle in\nempiricists\u2019 minds to explaining causation in terms of\ncounterfactuals was the obscurity of counterfactuals themselves, owing\nchiefly to their reference to unactualised possibilities. The true\npotential of the counterfactual approach to causation did not become\nclear until counterfactuals became better understood through the\ndevelopment of possible world semantics in the early 1970s.\n\nThe best known and most thoroughly elaborated counterfactual theory of\ncausation is David Lewis\u2019s theory in his (1973b). Lewis\u2019s\ntheory was refined and extended in articles subsequently collected in\nhis (1986a). In response to doubts about the theory\u2019s treatment\nof preemption, Lewis subsequently proposed a fairly radical revision\nof the theory (2000/2004a). In this section we shall confine our\nattention to the original 1973 theory, deferring the later changes he\nproposed for consideration below.\n\n1.1 Counterfactuals and Causal Dependence\n1.2 The Temporal Asymmetry of Causal Dependence\n1.3 Transitivity and Preemption\n1.4 Chancy Causation\n\n1.1 Counterfactuals and Causal Dependence\n\nLike most contemporary counterfactual theories, Lewis\u2019s theory\nemploys a possible world semantics for counterfactuals. Such a\nsemantics states truth conditions for counterfactuals in terms of\nsimilarity relations between possible worlds. Lewis famously espouses\nrealism about possible worlds, according to which non-actual possible\nworlds are real concrete entities on a par with the actual world\n(Lewis 1986e). However, most contemporary philosophers would seek to\ndeploy the explanatorily fruitful possible worlds framework while\ndistancing themselves from full-blown realism about possible worlds\nthemselves (see the entry on\n possible worlds).\n\nThe central notion of a possible world semantics for counterfactuals\nis a relation of comparative similarity between worlds (Lewis\n1973a). One world is said to be closer to actuality than\nanother if the first resembles the actual world more than the second\ndoes. In terms of this similarity relation, the truth condition for\nthe counterfactual \u201cIf A were (or had been) the case,\nC would be (or have been) the case\u201d is stated as\nfollows:\n\n(1)\n\u201cIf A were the case, C would be the\ncase\u201d is true in the actual world if and only if either\n(i) there are no possible A-worlds; or (ii) some\nA-world where C holds is closer to the actual world\nthan is any A-world where C does not hold.\n\n\nWe shall ignore the first case in which the counterfactual is\nvacuously true. The fundamental idea of this analysis is that the\ncounterfactual \u201cIf A were the case, C would be\nthe case\u201d is true just in case it takes less of a departure from\nactuality to make the antecedent true along with the consequent than\nto make the antecedent true without the consequent.\n\nIn terms of counterfactuals, Lewis defines a notion of causal\ndependence between events, which plays a central role in his theory of\ncausation (1973b).\n\n(2)\nWhere c and e are two distinct possible\nevents, e causally depends on c if and only\nif, if c were to occur e would occur; and if\n    c were not to occur e would not occur.\n\nThis condition states that whether e occurs or not depends on\nwhether c occurs or not. Where c and e are\nevents that actually occur, this truth condition can be simplified\nsomewhat. For in this case it follows from the second formal condition\non the comparative similarity relation that the counterfactual\n\u201cIf c were to occur e would occur\u201d is\nautomatically true: this formal condition implies that a\ncounterfactual with true antecedent and true consequent is itself\ntrue. Consequently, the truth condition for causal dependence\nbecomes:\n\n(3)\nWhere c and e are two distinct actual\nevents, e causally depends on c if and only\n    if, if c were not to occur e would not occur.\n\nThere are three important things to note about the definition of\ncausal dependence. First, it takes the primary relata of causal\ndependence to be events. Lewis\u2019s own theory of events\n(1986b) construes events as classes of possible spatiotemporal\nregions. However, different conceptions of events are compatible with\nthe basic definition (Kim 1973a; for an alternative broadly Lewisian\ntake on events see McDonnell 2016 and Kaiserman 2017). Indeed, it even\nseems possible to formulate it in terms of facts rather than events\n(Mellor 1995, 2004).\n\nSecond, the definition requires the causally dependent events to be\ndistinct from each other. Distinctness means that the events\nare not identical, neither is part of the other, and neither implies\nthe other. This qualification is important if spurious non-causal\ndependences are to be ruled out. (For this point see Kim 1973b and\nLewis 1986b.) For while you would not have written \u2018Larry\u2019\nif you had not written \u2018rr\u2019; and you would not have said\n\u2018Hello\u2019 loudly if you had not said \u2018Hello\u2019,\nneither dependence counts as a causal dependence since the paired\nevents are not distinct from each other in the required sense.\n\nConvinced by the need to make room in his analysis for causation by\n(and of) absence \u2013 as when the gardener\u2019s failure to water\nthe plants causes their death \u2013 Lewis later amended his view to\nthe view that causal dependence is a matter of counterfactual\ndependence between events or their absences (Lewis 2000: \u00a7X;\n2004b). We shall largely ignore this complication in what follows; for\nsome discussion of causation by absence see Schaffer 2000b, Beebee\n2004b, McGrath 2005, Livengood and Machery 2007, Dowe 2009.\n\nThird, the counterfactuals that are employed in the analysis are to be\nunderstood according to what Lewis calls the standard interpretation.\nThere are several possible ways of interpreting counterfactuals; and\nsome interpretations give rise to spurious non-causal dependences\nbetween events. For example, suppose that the events c and\ne are effects of a common cause d. It is tempting to\nreason that there must be a causal dependence between c and\ne by engaging in the following piece of counterfactual\nreasoning: if c had not occurred, then d would not\nhave occurred; and if d had not occurred, e would\nnot have occurred. But Lewis says the former counterfactual, which he\ncalls a backtracking counterfactual, is not to be used in the\nassessment of causal dependence. The right counterfactuals to be used\nare non-backtracking counterfactuals that typically hold the\npast fixed up until the time (or just before the time) at which the\ncounterfactual\u2019s antecedent is supposed to obtain. Thus if\nc had not occurred, d \u2013 which in fact occurred\nbefore c \u2013 would have occurred anyway; so on the\nstandard interpretation, where backtracking counterfactuals are false,\nthe inference to the claim that e causally depends on\nc is blocked.\n1.2 The Temporal Asymmetry of Causal Dependence\n\nWhat constitutes the direction of the causal relation? Why is this\ndirection typically aligned with the temporal direction from past to\nfuture? In answer to these questions, Lewis (1979) argues that the\ndirection of causation is the direction of causal dependence; and it\nis typically true that events causally depend on earlier events but\nnot on later events. He emphasises the contingency of the latter fact\nbecause he regards backwards or time-reversed causation as a\nconceptual possibility that cannot be ruled out a priori.\nAccordingly, he dismisses any analysis of counterfactuals that would\ndeliver the temporal asymmetry by conceptual fiat.\n\nLewis\u2019s explanation of the temporal asymmetry of counterfactual\ndependence comes from a combination of his analysis of the similarity\nrelation together with the (alleged) \u2018asymmetry of\noverdetermination\u2019 \u2013 a contingent feature of the world.\nAccording to this analysis, there are several respects of similarity\nto be taken into account in evaluating non-backtracking\ncounterfactuals: similarity with respect to laws of nature and also\nsimilarity with respect to particular matters of fact. Worlds are more\nsimilar to the actual world the fewer miracles or violations of the\nactual laws of nature they contain. Again, worlds are more similar to\nthe actual world the greater the spatio-temporal region of perfect\nmatch of particular fact they have with the actual world. If the laws\nof the actual world are deterministic, these rules will clash in\nassessing which counterfactual worlds are more similar to the actual\nworld. For a world that makes a counterfactual antecedent true must\ndiffer from the actual world either in allowing some violation of the\nactual laws (a \u2018divergence miracle\u2019), or in differing from\nthe actual world in particular fact. Lewis\u2019s analysis allows a\ntradeoff between these competing respects of similarity in such cases.\nIt implies that worlds with an extensive region of perfect match of\nparticular fact can be considered very similar to the actual world\nprovided that the match in particular facts with the actual world is\nachieved at the cost of a small, local miracle, but not at the cost of\na big, diverse miracle.\n\nTaken by itself, this account contains no built-in time asymmetry.\nThat comes only when the account is combined with the asymmetry of\noverdetermination: the (alleged) fact that effects are rarely\noverdetermined by their causes, but causes are very often\noverdetermined by their effects. Taking an example from Elga (2000):\nsuppose that Gretta cracks an egg at 8.00 (event c), pops it in\nthe frying pan, and eats it for her breakfast. What would have\nhappened had c not occurred? The right answer (Answer 1) is\nthat the egg would not then have been fried and Gretta would not have\neaten it \u2013 and not (Answer 2) that she would still have fried\nand eaten the egg, but these events would somehow have come about\ndespite her failing to crack it in the first place. The question is:\nhow does Lewis\u2019s analysis of the similarity relation deliver Answer\n1 and not Answer 2? In particular, consider worlds where there is\nperfect match of particular fact until just before 8.00, and then a\nmiracle, and then no perfect match of particular fact thereafter. Call\nthe closest such world World 1. Now consider worlds where there is no\nperfect match of particular fact before 8.00 (and in particular,\nGretta does not crack the egg), a miracle just after 8.00, and\nthen perfect match of particular fact thereafter. Call the closest\nsuch world World 2. (Intuitively, in the first case we keep the past\nfixed, insert a miracle just before 8.00 so that c doesn\u2019t\noccur, and the future unfolds thereafter according to the (actual)\nlaws. In the second case, we keep the future fixed, insert a miracle\njust after 8.00 so that c doesn\u2019t occur, and the past\nunfolds according to the (actual) laws.) Why is World 1 closer to\nactuality than is World 2?\n\nLewis\u2019s answer to that question comes from the fact that\nc leaves very many traces: at 8.02, for example, there is the\negg cooking in the pan, the cracked empty shell in the bin, traces of\nraw egg on Gretta\u2019s fingers, her memory of having just now cracked\nit, and so on. So in World 2, Gretta fails to crack the egg but then,\nshortly thereafter, seems to remember cracking it, there is the egg in\nthe pan, the empty shell in the bin, and so on. So World 2 \u2013\nsince it contains all of these events without the egg being cracked in\nthe first place \u2013 needs to contain not just one miracle but\nseveral: one to take care of each of these effects. World 1, by\ncontrast, requires just the one small miracle to stop Gretta cracking\nthe egg. Hence World 2 contains a \u2018big, diverse\u2019 miracle while\nWorld 1 contains just one small miracle; hence World 1 is closer to\nactuality than is World 2; hence Lewis\u2019s analysis yields the correct\nresult that had Gretta not cracked the egg, she would not have eaten\nit.\n\nThe result in Gretta\u2019s case generalises to the extent that causes\nare overdetermined by their effects but effects are not overdetermined\nby their causes. Overdetermination of effects by causes does of course\nhappen \u2013 as when the victim is simultaneously shot by several\nassassins \u2013 but it is relatively rare, and even when it happens\nthe effect is overdetermined only by a handful of events. By contrast,\nthe leaving of traces is ubiquitous \u2013 and (or so Lewis needs to\nthink) the extent of overdetermination, in any given case, is much\ngreater than in cases of cause-to-effect overdetermination. Both of\nthese, however, are contingent features of the actual world (or so\nLewis claims; but see \u00a72.1 below).\n\nIn general, then, the symmetric analysis of similarity and the de\nfacto asymmetry of overdetermination together imply that worlds\nthat accommodate counterfactual changes by preserving the actual past\nand allowing for divergence miracles are more similar to the actual\nworld than worlds that accommodate such changes by allowing for\nconvergence miracles that preserve the actual future. This fact in\nturn implies that, where the asymmetry of overdetermination obtains,\nthe present counterfactually depends on the past, but not on the\nfuture.\n1.3 Transitivity and Preemption\n\nAs Lewis notes (1973b), causal dependence between actual events is\nsufficient for causation, but not necessary: it is possible to have\ncausation without causal dependence. A standard case of\n\u2018pre-emption\u2019 will illustrate this. Suppose that two shooters\nconspire to assassinate a hated dictator, agreeing that one or other\nwill shoot the dictator on a public occasion. Acting side by side,\nassassins A and B find a good vantage point, and,\nwhen the dictator appears, both take aim (events a and b\nrespectively). A pulls her trigger and fires a shot that hits\nits mark, but B desists from firing when he sees A\npull her trigger. Here assassin A\u2019s actions (such as\nher taking aim) are causes of the dictator\u2019s death, while\nB\u2019s actions (such as his taking aim) are merely\npreempted potential causes. (Lewis distinguishes such cases of\npreemption from cases of symmetrical overdetermination\nin which two processes terminate in the effect, with neither process\npreempting the other. Lewis believes that these cases are not suitable\ntest cases for a theory of causation since they do not elicit clear\njudgements.) The problem raised by this example of preemption is that\nboth actions are on a par from the point of view of causal dependence:\nhad neither A nor B acted, then the dictator would\nnot have died; and if either had acted without the other, the dictator\nwould have died.\n\nTo overcome this problem Lewis extends causal dependence to a\ntransitive relation by taking its ancestral. He defines a causal\nchain as a finite sequence of actual events c,\nd, e, \u2026 where d causally depends on\nc, e on d, and so on throughout the\nsequence. Then causation is finally defined in these terms:\n\n(4)\nc is a cause of e if and only if there\n    exists a causal chain leading from c to e.\n\nGiven the definition of causation in terms of causal chains, Lewis is\nable to distinguish preempting actual causes (such as a) from\npreempted potential causes (such as b). There is a causal chain\nrunning from a to the dictator\u2019s death, but no such\nchain running from b to the dictator\u2019s death. Take, for\nexample, as an intermediary event occurring between a and the\ndictator\u2019s death, the bullet from A\u2019s gun\nspeeding through the air in mid-trajectory. The speeding bullet\ncausally depends on a, since that particular bullet would not\nhave been in mid-trajectory had A not taken aim; and the\ndictator\u2019s death causally depends on the speeding bullet, since\nby the time the bullet is in mid-trajectory B has refrained\nfrom firing so that the dictator would not have died without the\npresence of the speeding bullet. (Recall that we are not allowed to\n\u2018backtrack\u2019: it is not true that if the bullet had not been\nmid-trajectory A would not have taken aim, and hence it is not\ntrue that had the bullet not been mid-trajectory B would have\nfired after all.) Hence, we have a causal chain, and so causation. But\nno corresponding intermediary can be found between b and the\ndictator\u2019s death; hence b does not count as causes of\nthe death.\n\nLewis\u2019s definition of causation also delivers the result that\ncausation is a transitive relation: whenever c causes d\nand d causes e, it will also be true that c\ncauses e. The transitivity of causation fits with at least some\nof our explanatory practices. For example, historians wishing to\nexplain some significant historical event will trace the explanation\nback through a number of causal links, concluding that the event at\nthe beginning of the causal chain is responsible for the event being\nexplained. As we shall see later, however, some authors have claimed\nthat causation is not in fact transitive.\n1.4 Chancy Causation\n\nSo far we have considered how the counterfactual theory of causation\nworks under the assumption of determinism. But what about causation\nwhen determinism fails? Lewis (1986c) argues that chancy causation is\na conceptual possibility that must be accommodated by a theory of\ncausation. Indeed, contemporary physics tells us the actual world\nabounds with probabilistic processes that are causal in character. To\ntake a familiar example (Lewis 1986c): suppose that you mischievously\nhook up a bomb to a radioactive source and Geiger counter in such a\nway that the bomb explodes if the counter registers a certain number\nof clicks within ten minutes. If it happens that the counter registers\nthe required number of clicks and the bomb explodes, your act caused\nthe explosion, even though there is no deterministic connection\nbetween them: consistent with the actual past and the laws, the Geiger\ncounter might not have registered sufficiently many clicks.\n\nIn principle a counterfactual analysis of causation is well placed to\ndeal with chancy causation, since counterfactual dependence does not\nrequire that the cause was sufficient, in the circumstances, for the\neffect \u2013 it only requires that the cause was necessary in the\ncircumstances for the effect. The problem posed by abandoning the\nassumption of determinism, however, is that pervasive indeterminism\nundermines the plausibility of the idea that \u2013 preemption and\noverdetermination aside \u2013 effects generally counterfactually\ndepend on their causes. In the Geiger counter case above, for example,\nsuppose that the chance of the bomb exploding can be altered by means\nof a dial. (A low setting means the Geiger counter needs to register a\nlot of clicks in order for the bomb to go off in the next ten minutes,\nthus making the explosion very unlikely; a high setting means it needs\nto register very few clicks, thus making the explosion very likely.)\nThe dial is on a low setting; I increase the chance of the bomb\nexploding by turning it up. My act was a cause of the explosion, but\nit\u2019s not true that, had I not done it, the bomb would not have\nexploded; it would merely have been very unlikely to do so. \n\nIn order to accommodate chancy causation, Lewis (1986c) defines a more\ngeneral notion of causal dependence in terms of chancy\ncounterfactuals. These counterfactuals are of the form \u201cIf\nA were the case Pr (C) would be\nx\u201d, where the counterfactual is an ordinary\nwould-counterfactual, interpreted according to the semantics above,\nand the Pr operator is a probability operator with narrow\nscope confined to the consequent of the counterfactual. Lewis\ninterprets the probabilities involved as temporally indexed\nsingle-case chances. (See his (1980) for the theory of single-case\nchance.)\n\nThe more general notion of causal dependence reads:\n\n(5)\nWhere c and e are distinct actual events,\ne causally depends on c if and only if, if\nc had not occurred, the chance of e\u2019s\noccurring would be much less than its actual chance.\n\nThis definition covers cases of deterministic causation in which the\nchance of the effect with the cause is 1 and the chance of the effect\nwithout the cause is 0. But it also allows for cases of irreducible\nprobabilistic causation where these chances can take non-extreme\nvalues, as in the Geiger-counter-with-dial example above. It is\nsimilar to the central notion of probabilistic relevance used in\nprobabilistic theories of type-causation, except that it employs\nchancy counterfactuals rather than conditional probabilities. (See the\ndiscussion in Lewis 1986c for the advantages of the counterfactual\napproach over the probabilistic one. Also see the entry\n probabilistic causation.)\n\nThe rest of the theory of chancy causation follows the outlines of the\ntheory of deterministic causation: again, we have causation when we\nhave one or more steps of causal dependence.\n2. Problems for Lewis\u2019s Counterfactual Theory\n\nIn this section we consider the principal difficulties for\nLewis\u2019s theory that have emerged in discussion over the last\nforty-five years.\n\n2.1 Temporal Asymmetry\n2.2 Transitivity\n2.3 Preemption\n\n2.1 Temporal Asymmetry\n\nThere have been several important critical discussions of\nLewis\u2019s explanation of the temporal asymmetry of causation. (For\nsome early discussions see Horwich 1987: Chap. 10; Hausman 1998: Chap.\n6; Price 1996: Chap. 6.) One important criticism concerns the\n\u2018asymmetry of miracles\u2019 that is central to Lewis\u2019s\naccount of the temporal asymmetry of causation: a miracle that\nrealises a counterfactual antecedent about particular facts at time\nt by having a possible world diverge from the actual world\njust before the time t is, Lewis claims, smaller and less\ndiverse than a miracle that realises the same counterfactual\nantecedent and makes a possible world converge to the actual world\nafter the time t. Adam Elga (2000) has argued that the\nasymmetry of miracles does not hold in many cases. \n\nElga\u2019s argument proceeds by way of the example of Gretta cracking an\negg described earlier, and the basic idea is that in fact World 2\nabove \u2013 the closest world where particular fact in the past up\nuntil shortly after 8.00 doesn\u2019t match actuality (and, in\nparticular, Gretta doesn\u2019t crack the egg), there is a miracle\nshortly after 8.00, and thereafter World 2 evolves according to the\nactual world\u2019s laws and matches actuality perfectly with respect to\nparticular fact. Thinking in the future-to-past direction for now,\nconsider what happens at the actual world from a time-reversed point\nof view: Gretta transfers the egg from her plate to the hot pan, the\npan cools down and the egg uncooks, and then it leaps up into the\nwaiting shell, which closes neatly around it. Now (to get us to World\n2) insert a small miracle \u2013 at 8.05, say, when the egg is\nnicely cooked in the pan \u2013 altering just the positions of a few\nmolecules, say, so that what happens (again, proceeding from future to\npast) is that (lawfully, once the miracle has occurred) the egg just\nsits in the pan, cooling down and transferring heat to the pan in the\nprocess, and then gradually rots in the way that eggs normally do\n(except that they normally do that in the past-to-future direction).\nThe idea is that, while World 2 (viewed from past to future) looks\nexceedingly strange \u2013 after all, it involves Gretta devouring\nwhat was once a horrible rotten egg that somehow found its way into\nher pan and then bizarrely de-rotted \u2013 none of that is unlawful.\nIt is just, thanks to the laws of thermodynamics, spectacularly\nunlikely.\n\nBut how does this help us with the original problem with World 2,\nnamely the fact that all of the traces of Gretta\u2019s actual\negg-cracking, such as her remembering cracking it, the presence of the\nempty, broken eggshell in the bin, and so on, would have to somehow be\nindividually be brought about in World 2 by additional miracles, in\norder to preserve perfect match of particular fact from 8.05 onwards?\nThe short answer is that they don\u2019t. The \u2018traces\u2019 are there in\nWorld 2 all right, and of course we would normally expect such\n\u2018traces\u2019 to point pretty conclusively to Gretta having recently\ncracked an egg. But they don\u2019t lawfully entail that she did.\nAgain looking at World 2 from a time-reversed perspective, we take the\nworld as it is after 8.05, \u2018traces\u2019 and all, and run the laws\nbackwards (apart from the small miracle that makes the egg rot slowly\nin the pan rather than leaping up into the waiting shell). What\n\u2018follows\u2019 (still going backwards in time) is anyone\u2019s guess, and\nwhatever it is it will doubtless look bizarre when viewed in the\nusual, past-to-future direction. Be that as it may, World 2 is a world\nwith a single, small miracle at 8.05, with perfect match of particular\nfact thereafter, which is just as close to the actual world as is\nWorld 1, where there is a small miracle before Gretta cracks\nthe egg. So, Elga argues, there is no asymmetry of counterfactual\ndependence, as Lewis defines it.\n\nSeveral authors have come to the conclusion that a viable account of\nthe asymmetry of counterfactual dependence must derive not from the\nasymmetry of miracles, as Lewis claims, but from thermodynamic\nasymmetry: from the fact that entropy increases towards the future. In\nparticular, David Albert (2000) proposes that we need to assume the\n\u2018Past Hypothesis\u2019: the assumption that the universe began in an\nextremely low entropy condition. The Past Hypothesis and its\nrelationship to the asymmetry of counterfactual dependence has been\nmuch discussed. (See Frisch 2005, 2007; Loewer 2007; Price and Weslake\n2009; Kutach 2002, 2013.)\n2.2 Transitivity\n\nAs we have seen, Lewis builds transitivity into causation by defining\ncausation in terms of chains of causal dependence. However, a number\nof alleged counter-examples have been presented which cast doubt on\ntransitivity. (Lewis 2004a presents a short catalogue of these\ncounterexamples.) Here is a sample of two counterexamples.\n\nFirst, an unpublished but much-discussed example due to Ned Hall. A\nhiker is walking along a mountain trail, when a boulder high above is\ndislodged and comes careering down the mountain slopes. The hiker\nnotices the boulder and ducks at the appropriate time. The careering\nboulder causes the hiker to duck and this, in turn, causes his\ncontinued stride. (This second causal link involves double\nprevention: the duck prevents the collision between hiker and\nboulder which, had it occurred, would have prevented the hiker\u2019s\ncontinued stride.) However, the careering boulder is the sort of thing\nthat would normally prevent the hiker\u2019s continued stride and so\nit seems counterintuitive to say that it causes the stride.\n\nSecond, an example due to Douglas Ehring (1987). Jones puts some\npotassium salts into a hot fire. Because potassium compounds produce a\npurple flame when heated, the flame changes to a purple colour, though\neverything else remains the same. The purple flame ignites some\nflammable material nearby. Here we judge that putting the potassium\nsalts in the fire caused the purple flame, which in turn caused the\nflammable material to ignite. But it seems implausible to judge that\nputting the potassium salts in the fire caused the flammable material\nto ignite.\n\nVarious replies have been made to these counterexamples. L.A. Paul\n(2004) offers a response to the second example that involves\nconceiving of the relata of causation as event aspects: she\nargues that there is mismatch between the event aspect that is the\neffect of the first causal link (the flame\u2019s being a purple\ncolour) and the event aspect that is the cause of the second causal\nlink (the flame\u2019s touching the flammable material). Thus, while\nit\u2019s true that the purple flame did not cause the ignition,\nthere is no failure of transitivity after all. Maslen (2004) solves\nthe problem by appealing to a contrastivist account of causation (see\n\u00a74 below): the contrast situation at the effect-end of the first\ncausal statement does not match up with the contrast situation at the\ncause-end of the second causal statement. Thus, the first causal\nstatement should be interpreted as saying that Jones\u2019s putting\npotassium salts in the fire rather not doing so caused the flame to\nturn purple rather than yellow; but the second causal\nstatement should be interpreted as saying that the purple\nfire\u2019s occurring rather than not occurring caused the\nflammable material to ignite rather not to ignite. Where there is a\nmismatch of this kind, we do not have a genuine counterexample to\ntransitivity. \n\nThe first example cannot be handled in the same way. Some defenders of\ntransitivity have replied that our intuitions about the intransitivity\nof causation in these examples are misleading. For instance, Lewis\n(2004a) points out that the counterexamples to transitivity typically\ninvolve a structure in which a c-type event generally\nprevents an e-type but in the particular case the\nc-event actually causes another event that counters the\nthreat and causes the e-event. If we mix up questions of what\nis generally conducive to what, with questions about what caused what\nin this particular case, he says, we may think that it is reasonable\nto deny that c causes e. But if we keep the focus\nsharply on the particular case, we must insist that c does in\nfact cause e.\n\nThe debate about the transitivity of causation is not easily settled,\npartly because it is tied up with the issue of how it is best for a\ncounterfactual theory to deal with examples of preemption. As we have\nseen, Lewis\u2019s counterfactual theory relies on the transitivity\nof causation to handle cases of preemption. If such cases could be\nhandled in some other way, that would take some of the theoretical\npressure off the theory, allowing it to concede the alleged\ncounterexamples to transitivity without succumbing to the difficulties\nposed by preemption. (For more on this point see Hitchcock 2001. For\nan extensive discussion of the issues around transitivity see Paul and\nHall 2013: Chap. 5.)\n2.3 Preemption\n\nAs we have seen, Lewis employs his strategy of defining causation in\nterms of chains of causal dependence not only to make causation\ntransitive, but also to deal with preemption examples. However, there\nare preemption examples that this strategy cannot deal with\nsatisfactorily. Difficulties concerning preemption have proven to be\nthe biggest bugbear for Lewis\u2019s theory. (Paul and Hall 2013:\nChap. 3 contains an extensive discussion of the problems posed by\npreemption and other kinds of redundant causation for counterfactual\ntheories.) \n\nIn his (1986c: 200), Lewis distinguishes cases of early and\nlate preemption. In early preemption examples, the process\nrunning from the preempted alternative is cut short before the main\nprocess running from the preempting cause has gone to completion. The\nexample of the two assassins, given above, is an example of this sort.\nThe theory of causation in terms of chains of causal dependence can\nhandle this sort of example. In contrast, cases of late preemption are\nones in which the process running from the preempted cause is cut\nshort by the main process running to completion and bringing about the\neffect before the preempted potential cause has the opportunity to do\nso. The following is an example of late preemption due to Hall\n(2004).\n\nBilly and Suzy throw rocks at a bottle. Suzy throws first so that her\nrock arrives first and shatters the glass; Billy\u2019s rock sails\nthrough the air where the bottle had stood moments earlier. Without\nSuzy\u2019s throw, Billy\u2019s throw would have shattered the\nbottle. However, Suzy\u2019s throw caused the bottle to shatter,\nwhile Billy\u2019s throw is merely a preempted potential cause. This\nis a case of late preemption because the alternative process\n(Billy\u2019s throw) is cut short by the main process (Suzy\u2019s\nthrow) running to completion.\n\nLewis\u2019s theory cannot explain the judgement that Suzy\u2019s\nthrow caused the shattering of the bottle. For there is no causal\ndependence between Suzy\u2019s throw and the shattering, since even\nif Suzy had not thrown her rock, the bottle would have shattered due\nto Billy\u2019s throw. Nor is there a chain of stepwise dependences\nrunning cause to effect, because there is no event intermediate\nbetween Suzy\u2019s throw and the shattering that links them up into\na chain of dependences. Take, for instance, Suzy\u2019s rock in\nmid-trajectory.\u00a0 This event depends on Suzy\u2019s initial\nthrow, but the problem is that the shattering of the bottle does not\ndepend on it, because even without it the bottle would still have\nshattered because of Billy\u2019s throw.\n\nTo be sure, the bottle shattering that would have occurred without\nSuzy\u2019s throw would be different from the bottle shattering that\nactually occurred with Suzy\u2019s throw. For a start, it would have\noccurred later. This observation suggests that one solution to the\nproblem of late preemption might be to insist that the events involved\nshould be construed as fragile events. Accordingly, it will be true\nrather than false that if Suzy had not thrown her rock, then the\nactual bottle shattering, taken as a fragile event with an essential\ntime and manner of occurrence, would not have occurred. Lewis himself\ndoes not endorse this response on the grounds that a uniform policy of\nconstruing events as fragile would go against our usual practices, and\nwould generate many spurious causal dependences. For example, suppose\nthat a poison kills its victim more slowly and painfully when taken on\na full stomach. Then the victim\u2019s eating dinner before he drinks\nthe poison would count as a cause of his death since the time and\nmanner of the death depend on the eating of the dinner. (For\ndiscussion of the limitations of this response see Lewis 1986c,\n2000.)\n\nThe solution to the late preemption problem that Lewis cautiously\nendorses in his 1986c appeals to the notion of quasi-dependence.\nConsider a case that resembles the case of Billy and Suzy throwing\nrocks at a bottle. Suzy throws a rock (c) and shatters the\nbottle (e) in exactly the same way in which she does in the\noriginal case. But in this case Billy and his rock are entirely\nabsent. In the original case, e is caused by but does not\ncounterfactually depend on c, whereas in this second case\ne is caused by and does counterfactually depend on c.\nBut the intrinsic character of the process leading from c to\ne is just the same in both cases. Thus, Lewis says, in the\noriginal case (with Billy also throwing), e quasi-depends on\nc. So \u201cwe could redefine a causal chain as a sequence of\ntwo or more events, with either dependence or quasi-dependence at each\nstep. And as always, one event is a cause of another iff there is a\ncausal chain from one to the other\u201d (1986c, 206). (A related\nidea is pursued in Menzies 1996 and 1999.) Note that, this proposed\ndefinition of a causal chain notwithstanding, the quasi-dependence\nsolution does not demand transitivity in the way that Lewis\u2019s\nearlier solution to the problem of early preemption did: with back-up\npotential causes safely out of the way, in all cases of preemption\n(early and late), the effect should straightforwardly quasi-depend on\nits cause.\n\nLewis\u2019s dissatisfaction with his own attempts to deal with the\nproblem of late preemption, as well as his theory\u2019s inability to\ndeal with \u2018trumping preemption\u2019 (Schaffer 2000a), led to\nthe development of his 2000 theory. A further problem relating to\npreemption that arises for chancy causation \u2013 which the 2000\ntheory does not address \u2013 is discussed in\n \u00a75.4\n below.\n3. Lewis\u2019s 2000 Theory\n\nIn an attempt to deal with the various problems facing his 1973\ntheory, Lewis developed a new version of the counterfactual theory,\nwhich he first presented in his Whitehead Lectures at Harvard\nUniversity in March 1999. (A shortened version of the lectures\nappeared as his 2000. The full lectures are published as his\n2004a.)\n\nCounterfactuals play a central role in the new theory, as in the old.\nBut the counterfactuals it employs do not simply state dependences of\nwhether one event occurs on whether another event\noccurs. The counterfactuals state dependences of whether,\nwhen, and how one event occurs on whether,\nwhen, and how another event occurs. A key idea in the\nformulation of these counterfactuals is that of an alteration\nof an event. This is an actualised or unactualised event that occurs\nat a slightly different time or in a slightly different manner from\nthe given event. An alteration is, by definition, a very fragile event\nthat could not occur at a different time, or in a different manner\nwithout being a different event. Lewis intends the terminology to be\nneutral on the issue of whether an alteration of an event is a version\nof the same event or a numerically different event.\n\nThe central notion of the new theory is that of influence:\n\n(6)\nWhere c and e are distinct events, c\ninfluences e if and only if there is a substantial\nrange c1, c2, \u2026 of different not-too-distant\nalterations of c (including the actual alteration of\nc) and there is a range e1, e2, \u2026 of\nalterations of e, at least some of which differ, such that if\nc1 had occurred, e1 would have occurred, and if\nc2 had occurred, e2 would have occurred, and so on.\n\nWhere one event influences another, there is a pattern of\ncounterfactual dependence of whether, when, and how upon whether,\nwhen, and how. As before, causation is defined as an ancestral\nrelation:\n\n(7)\nc causes e if and only if there is a\n    chain of stepwise influence from c to e.\n\nOne of the points Lewis advances in favour of this new theory is that\nit handles cases of late as well as early preemption. (The theory is\nrestricted to deterministic causation and so does not address the\nexample of probabilistic preemption described below in\n \u00a75.4.)\n Reconsider, for instance, the example of late preemption involving\nBilly and Suzy throwing rocks at a bottle. The theory is supposed to\nexplain why Suzy\u2019s throw, and not Billy\u2019s throw, is the\ncause of the shattering of the bottle. If we take an alteration in\nwhich Suzy\u2019s throw is slightly different (the rock is lighter,\nor she throws sooner), while holding fixed Billy\u2019s throw, we\nfind that the shattering is different too. But if we make similar\nalterations to Billy\u2019s throw while holding Suzy\u2019s throw\nfixed, we find that the shattering is unchanged.\n\nAnother point in favour of the new theory is that it handles cases of\n\u2018trumping\u2019 preemption, first described by Jonathan\nSchaffer (2000a). Lewis gives an example involving a major and a\nsergeant who are shouting orders at the soldiers. The major and\nsergeant simultaneously shout \u2018Advance!\u2019; the soldiers\nhear them both and advance. Since the soldiers obey the superior\nofficer, they advance because the major orders them to, not because\nthe sergeant does. So the major\u2019s command preempts or trumps the\nsergeant\u2019s. Other theories have difficulty with trumping cases,\nincluding \u2013 or so Lewis believes \u2013 his own attempt to\nsolve the late preemption problem by appealing to quasi-dependence\n(2000, 184-5). The trumping case is one in which the causal chain\nleading from the sergeant\u2019s shout to the soldiers\u2019\nadvancing runs to completion \u2013 or at least, Lewis thinks, it is\nepistemically possible that it does \u2013 just as the chain leading\nfrom the major\u2019s shouting does. So it is an intrinsic duplicate\nof the comparison case where the sergeant shouts but the major\ndoesn\u2019t; hence the soldiers\u2019 advancing quasi-depends on\nthe sergeant\u2019s shout, which is the wrong result. Lewis\u2019s\nargues that his new theory handles trumping cases with ease. Altering\nthe major\u2019s command while holding fixed the sergeant\u2019s,\nthe soldier\u2019s response would be correspondingly altered. In\ncontrast, altering the sergeant\u2019s command, while holding fixed\nthe major\u2019s, would make no difference at all.\n\nThere is, however, some reason for scepticism about whether the new\ntheory handles the examples of late preemption and trumping completely\nsatisfactorily. In the example of late preemption, Billy\u2019s throw\nhas some degree of influence on the shattering of the bottle. For if\nBilly had thrown his rock earlier (so that it preceded Suzy\u2019s\nthrow) and in a different manner, the bottle would have shattered\nearlier and in a different manner. Likewise, the sergeant\u2019s\ncommand has some degree of influence on the soldiers\u2019 advance in\nthat if the sergeant had shouted earlier than the major with a\ndifferent command, the soldiers would have obeyed his order. In\nresponse to these points, Lewis must say that these alterations of the\nevents are too distant to be considered relevant. But some metric of\ndistance in alterations is required, since it seems that similar\nalterations of Suzy\u2019s throw and the major\u2019s command are\nrelevant to their having causal influence.\n\nIt has also been argued that the new theory generates a great number\nof spurious cases of causation (Collins 2000; Kvart 2001). The theory\nimplies that any event that influences another event to a certain\ndegree counts as one of its causes. But common sense is more\ndiscriminating about causes. To take an example of Jonathan Bennett\n(1987): rain in December delays a forest fire; if there had been no\nDecember rain, the forest would have caught fire in January rather\nthan when it actually did in February. The rain influences the fire\nwith respect to its timing, location, rapidity, and so forth. But\ncommon sense denies that the rain was a cause of the fire,\nthough it allows that it is a cause of the delay in the fire.\nSimilarly, in the example of the poison victim discussed above, the\nvictim\u2019s ingesting poison on a full stomach influences the time\nand manner of his death (making it a slow and painful death), but\ncommon sense refuses to countenance his eating dinner as a cause of\nhis death, though it may countenance it as a cause of its\nbeing a slow and painful death. Pace Lewis, common sense\ndoes not take just anything that affects the time and manner of an\nevent to be a cause of the event simpliciter.\n4. Contextualism vs. Invariantism\n\nA question that has received increasing attention in recent years is\nwhether causation is an \u2018invariant\u2019 relation or whether,\ninstead, the truth of a given causal claim varies according to the\ncontext within which it is under discussion. (Note that\n\u2018invariant\u2019 is often used to describe a causal\nrelationship that is stable across a wide range of different\ncircumstances; this is not the meaning of \u2018invariant\u2019 as\nit is being used here.) There is a wealth of evidence that\npeople\u2019s causal judgements are sensitive to contextual factors\n(Hilton & Slugoski 1986; Cheng & Novick 1991; Knobe &\nFraser 2008; Hitchcock & Knobe 2009; Clarke et al. 2015; Kominsky\net al. 2015; Icard et al. 2017); however, in principle one might hold\nthe invariantist line and insist that what varies with context is not\ntruth but merely assertibility.\n\nConsider a standard problem case: the gardener and the Queen equally\nfail to water my flowers while I\u2019m on holiday, and their\nsubsequent death (e) counterfactually depends equally on their\nomissions. But many people\u2019s judgement is that only the\ngardener\u2019s \u2013 and not the Queen\u2019s \u2013 omission is\na genuine cause of their death (Beebee 2004b, McGrath 2005, Livengood\n& Machery 2007). We might accommodate that judgement by claiming\nthat it is false that the Queen\u2019s omission was a cause of\ne, and conclude that we need some additional constraint on\ncausation aside from counterfactual dependence, e.g. that causes must\nbe \u2018deviant\u2019 or abnormal: the gardener\u2019s behaviour\nwas deviant (he was supposed to, or perhaps normally does, water my\nflowers) but the Queen\u2019s was entirely normal (she never waters\nmy flowers, nor would anyone expect her to). Or we might accommodate\nthe judgement by appealing to pragmatic factors such as salience: the\ngardener\u2019s and the Queen\u2019s omissions are both, equally,\ncauses of e, but in most conversational contexts the\nQueen\u2019s omission simply isn\u2019t relevant. For example, if\nI\u2019m interested in finding out who is to blame for the\nflowers\u2019 death, the Queen\u2019s neglect is simply irrelevant\nto my investigation since it\u2019s obvious that she is not to\nblame.\n\nLewis himself takes this latter, invariantist approach (Lewis 2004b).\nThe causes of any given event are many and varied, and in any given\nexplanatory context most of them fail to be salient; that is why it\nstrikes us as wrong to mention them (Lewis 1986d). Lewis\u2019s\napproach is to explain (some of) the phenomena that motivate\ncontextualism by appealing to a broadly Gricean story about\nconversational implicature. An advantage of invariantism is that it\nallows us to conceive of causation as a fully objective,\nmind-independent \u2013 or, as Menzies (2009: 342) puts it, a\n\u2018natural\u2019 \u2013 relation.\n\nIt is unclear, however, that all alleged cases of context-dependence\ncan be dealt with in this manner. Suzy\u2019s theft of the coconut\ncake from the shop caused her subsequent illness: having bought the\ncake, she ate it \u2013 but (as she soon discovered) she\u2019s\nallergic to coconut. Or did it? It depends, it would seem, on what we\ncontrast her theft of the coconut cake with. If she\u2019d left the\nshop empty-handed \u2013 or stolen a Bath bun instead \u2013 she\nwouldn\u2019t have been ill. But if she\u2019d paid for the cake\ninstead of stealing it, she still would have been ill. We sometimes\nmark the intended contrast by, for example, stress: Suzy\u2019s theft\nof the coconut cake caused her illness, but her theft of\nthe coconut cake didn\u2019t.\n\nLewis\u2019s original theory of events (1986b) was tailor-made to\ndeal with such cases \u2013 or so it might seem. According to that\ntheory, an event is a set of spatio-temporal regions of worlds. We can\ndistinguish between, for example, the event that is essentially\nSuzy\u2019s theft of a cake (e1) and the event that\nis essentially her acquiring (one way or another) a coconut cake\n(e2): the two events consist in two different (but\noverlapping) sets of spatio-temporal regions of worlds that share\ntheir actual-world member, namely what actually happened in the cake\nshop. And so \u2013 at least on the face of it \u2013 we can say\nthat e2 was a cause of her illness but\ne1 was not (since had she not stolen a cake, she\nwould have bought the coconut cake instead).\n\nIt is unclear, however, that appeal to the essential features of\nevents successfully deals with the problem. After all, what if, had\nSuzy not stolen a cake, the cake she would have bought was a Bath bun\nand not the coconut cake she actually stole? (She really wanted a cake\nbut didn\u2019t have enough money for the coconut cake.) And in any case,\nLewis\u2019s own official view is that in supposing a putative cause\nc absent we \u2018imagine that c is completely and cleanly\nexcised from history, leaving behind no fragment or approximation of\nitself\u2019 (2004a: 90). So we don\u2019t appear to be able to recover the\ntruth of the claim that Suzy\u2019s theft of the cake was not a\ncause of her subsequent illness. Moreover, Lewis\u2019s 2000 theory of\ncausation as influence abandons the distinction between the essences\nof events to which the above response appealed: we have various\nalterations of the theft of the coconut cake (c) \u2013\nincluding the purchase of a coconut cake and the theft of a Bath bun,\nfor example \u2013 some of which would have resulted in an alteration\nof the effect e (Suzy\u2019s illness) and some of which would not\nhave. The degree of influence of c on e either is or is\nnot sufficient to make it the case that c was a cause of\ne; either way, \u2018Suzy\u2019s theft of the coconut cake was a\ncause of her illness\u2019 comes out either true or false\nindependently of context, which \u2013 according to the contextualist\n\u2013 is the wrong result. (The invariantist, however, might insist\nthat there is no real problem here. \u2018Because she stole a coconut\ncake\u2019 would be an inappropriate response to the question\n\u2018Why is Suzy ill?\u2019 if the request comes from the doctor,\nwho is not interested in how she procured the cake; but it would be an\nappropriate response in the context of a discussion about, say, Suzy\ngetting her comeuppance from her shoplifting habit.)\n\nCei Maslen (2004), Jonathan Schaffer (2005) and Robert Northcott\n(2008) all defend \u2018contrastive\u2019 accounts of causation. Schaffer\nconceives causation as a four-place relation \u2013 c rather\nthan c* caused e rather than e* \u2013 and\nclaims that context (or other devices, such as stress on a particular\nword) generally fixes the implied contrasts (c* and e*)\nin our ordinary, two-place causal talk, thereby playing a role in the\ntruth or falsity of our (two-place) causal claims. Note that\ncontrastivism about causation is a distinct position from the view\nthat explanations are (always or sometimes) contrastive (see e.g.\nLewis 1986d, \u00a7VI; Lipton 1991; Hitchcock 1999). On a contrastivist\nview of explanation, explanations (always or sometimes) take the form\n\u2018Why P rather than Q?\u2019, where the contrast\n(Q) may be explicitly stated or implied by the context in which\nthe question \u2018Why P?\u2019 is asked. Such a view is entirely\ncompatible with an invariantist view of causation, since the role of\nthe contrast may merely be to select which of P\u2019s causes is\ncited appropriately in answering the question. Note also that\ncontrastivism about explanation does not appear to solve the (alleged)\nproblem at hand. In the case of Suzy\u2019s theft of the cake, it is the\ncontrast on the side of causes (and hence explananda) that is at\nissue, and not the contrast on the side of the effect (explanandum);\nit is unclear how we might vary the contextually salient contrast to\n\u2018Suzy became ill\u2019 in such a way that different contrasts\ndeliver different verdicts on whether \u2018Suzy stole the coconut\ncake\u2019 is an appropriate explanans.\n\nWhile the contrastivist account of causation is generally considered\nto be a version of causal contextualism, contrastivism is nonetheless\ninvariantist in the sense that there is a context-independent fact of the matter about\nwhich four-place causal relations hold: it\u2019s just plain true that Suzy\u2019s stealing the cake\nrather than leaving empty-handed caused her to be ill rather than\nwell, and false that her stealing rather than buying the cake caused\nher to be ill rather than well. The contrastivist account might therefore be seen as a\nkind of middle road between invariantism and contextualism. (See\nSteglich-Petersen 2012 and Montminy & Russo 2016 for critical\ndiscussions of contextualism/contrastivism.)\n\nThe contextualist/invariantist debate arises in a slightly different\nform in much of the debate about the structural equations framework\n(see\n \u00a75.5\n below), to which we now turn.\n5. The Structural Equations Framework\n\nA number of contemporary philosophers have explored an alternative\ncounterfactual approach to causation that employs the structural\nequations framework. (Early exponents include Hitchcock 2001, 2007;\nWoodward 2003; Woodward and Hitchcock 2003.) This framework, which has\nbeen used in the social sciences and biomedical sciences since the\n1930s and 1940s, received its state-of-the-art formulation in Judea\nPearl\u2019s landmark 2000 book. Hitchcock and Woodward acknowledge\ntheir debt to Pearl\u2019s work and to related work on causal Bayes\nnets by Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines (2001).\nHowever, while Pearl and Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines focus on issues\nto do with causal discovery and inference, Woodward and Hitchcock\nfocus on issues of the meaning of causal claims. For this reason,\ntheir formulations of the structural equations framework are better\nsuited to the purposes of this discussion. The exposition of this\nsection largely follows that of Hitchcock 2001.\n5.1 SEF: The Basic Picture\n\nThe structural equations framework describes the causal structure of a\nsystem in terms of a causal model of the system, which is identified\nas an ordered pair <V, E>, where V is a set\nof variables and E a set of structural equations stating\ndeterministic relations among the variables. (We shall confine our\nattention to deterministic systems here; see \u00a75.4 for a brief\ndiscussion of chancy causation.) The variables in V describe\nthe different possible states of the system in question. While they\ncan take any number of values, in the simple examples to be considered\nhere the variables are binary variables that take the value 1 if some\nevent occurs and the value 0 if the event does not occur. For example,\nlet us formulate a causal model to describe the system exemplified in\nthe example of late preemption to do with Billy and Suzy\u2019s rock\nthrowing. We might describe the system using the following set of\nvariables:\n\nBT = 1 if Billy throws a rock, 0 otherwise;\nST = 1 if Suzy throws a rock, 0 otherwise;\nBH = 1 if Billy\u2019s rock hits the bottle, 0\notherwise;\nSH = 1 if Suzy\u2019s rock hits the bottle, 0\notherwise;\nBS = 1 if the bottle shatters, 0 otherwise.\n\n\nHere the variables are binary. But a different model might have used\nmany-valued variables to represent the different ways in which Billy\nand Suzy threw their rocks, their rocks hit the bottle, or the bottle\nshattered.\n\nThe structural equations in a model specify which variables are to be held\nfixed at their actual values and how the values of other variables\ndepend on one another. There is a structural equation for each\nvariable. The form taken by a structural equation for a variable\ndepends on which kind of variable it is. The structural equation for\nan exogenous variable (the values of which are determined by\nfactors outside of the model) takes the form of Z = z,\nwhich simply states the actual value of the variable. The structural\nequation for an endogenous variable (the values of which are\ndetermined by factors within the model) states how the value of the\nvariable is determined by the values of the other variables. It takes\nthe form:\n\nY = f(X1,\u2026,\nXn)\n\n\nWhat does this structural equation mean? There are in fact competing\ninterpretations. Pearl (2000) regards the structural equations as the\nconceptual primitives of his framework, describing them as\nrepresenting \u2018the basic mechanisms\u2019 of the system under\ninvestigation. However, for the purposes of exposition, it is more\nconvenient to follow the interpretation of Woodward (2003) and\nHitchcock (2001), who think of the structural equations as expressing\ncertain basic counterfactuals of the following form:\n\nIf it were the case that X1 = x1,\nX2 = x2,\u2026,\nXn = xn, then it\nwould be the case that Y =\nf(x1,\u2026,xn).\n\n\nAs this form of counterfactual suggests, the structural equations are\nto be read from right to left: the antecedent of the counterfactual\nstates possible values of the variables X1 through\nto Xn and the consequent states the\ncorresponding value of the endogenous variable Y. There is a\ncounterfactual of this kind for every combination of possible values\nof the variables X1 through to\nXn. It is important to note that a structural\nequation of this kind is therefore not, strictly speaking, an identity\nsince there is a right-to-left asymmetry built into it. This asymmetry\ncorresponds to the asymmetry of non-backtracking counterfactuals. For\nexample, supposing that the actual situation is one in which neither\nSuzy nor Billy throws a rock so the bottle does not shatter, the\nnon-backtracking counterfactual \u201cIf either Suzy or Billy had\nthrown a rock, the bottle would have shattered\u201d is true. But the\ncounterfactual \u201cIf the bottle had shattered, either Suzy or\nBilly would have thrown a rock\u201d is false. \n\nAs an illustration, consider the set of structural equations that\nmight be used to model the late preemption example of Billy and Suzy.\nGiven the set of variables V listed above, the members of the\nset of the structural equations E might be stated as\nfollows:\n\nST = 1;\nBT = 1;\nSH = ST;\nBH = BT & ~SH;\nBS = SH v BH.\n\n\nIn these equations logical symbols are used to represent mathematical\nfunctions on binary variables: ~X = 1 \u2212 X;\nX v Y = max{X, Y}; X & Y\n= min{X, Y}. The first two equations simply state the\nactual values of the exogenous variables ST and BT. The\nthird equation encodes two counterfactuals, one for each possible\nvalue of ST. It states that if Suzy had thrown a rock (which in\nfact she did), her rock would have hit the bottle; and if she\nhadn\u2019t thrown a rock, it wouldn\u2019t have hit the bottle. The\nfourth equation encodes four counterfactuals, one for each possible\ncombination of values for BT and ~SH. It states that if\nBilly had thrown a rock and Suzy\u2019s rock hadn\u2019t hit the\nbottle, Billy\u2019s rock would have hit the bottle, but it\nwouldn\u2019t have done so if one or more of these conditions had not\nbeen met. The fifth equation also encodes four counterfactuals, one\nfor each possible combination of values for SH and BH.\nIt states that if one or other (or possibly both) of Suzy\u2019s rock\nor Billy\u2019s rock had hit the bottle, the bottle would have\nshattered; but if neither rock had hit the bottle, the bottle\nwouldn\u2019t have shattered.\n\nThe structural equations above can be represented in terms of a\ndirected graph. The variables in the set V are represented\nas nodes in the graph. An arrow directed from one node X to\nanother Y represents the fact that the variable X\nappears on the right-hand side of the structural equation for\nY. In this case, X is said to be a parent of\nY. Exogenous variables are represented by nodes that have no\narrows directed towards them. A directed path from X to\nY in a graph is a sequence of arrows that connect X with\nY. The directed graph of the model described above of Billy and\nSuzy example is depicted in Figure 1 below:\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nThe arrows in this figure tell us that the bottle\u2019s shattering\nis a function of Suzy\u2019s rock hitting the bottle and\nBilly\u2019s rock hitting the bottle; that Billy\u2019s rock hitting\nthe bottle is a function of Billy\u2019s throwing a rock and\nSuzy\u2019s rock hitting the bottle; and that Suzy\u2019s rock\nhitting the bottle is a function of her throwing the rock. It\u2019s\nimportant to note that the nodes in the graph represent variables and\nnot \u2013 as in the case of \u2018neuron diagrams\u2019, such as\nthose found in Lewis 1986c \u2013 values of variables. Note also that\nwhile the arrows tell us that there are counterfactual dependence\nrelations between the values of the variables \u2013 all of the\npossible values, not just the actual ones \u2013 they don\u2019t\ntells us what those dependence relations are; for that, you have to\nlook at the structural equations. For example, the directed graph only\ntells us that the value of BH counterfactually depends somehow\nor other on the values of BT and SH; e.g. it\ndoesn\u2019t tell us that if Billy had thrown and Suzy\u2019s rock\nhadn\u2019t hit, Billy\u2019s rock would have hit.)\n\nAs we have seen, the structural equations directly encode some\ncounterfactuals. However, some counterfactuals that are not directly\nencoded can be derived from them. Consider, for example, the\ncounterfactual \u201cIf Suzy\u2019s rock had not hit the bottle, it\nwould still have shattered\u201d. As a matter of fact, Suzy\u2019s\nrock did hit the bottle. But we can determine what would have happened\nif it hadn\u2019t done so, by replacing the structural equation for\nthe endogenous variable SH with the equation SH = 0,\nkeeping all the other equations unchanged. So, instead of having its\nvalue determined in the ordinary way by the variable ST, the\nvalue of SH is set \u2018miraculously\u2019. Pearl describes\nthis as a \u2018surgical intervention\u2019 that changes the value\nof the variable. In terms of its graphical representation, this\namounts to wiping out the arrow from the variable ST to the\nvariable SH and treating SH as if it were an exogenous\nvariable. After this operation, the value of the variable BS\ncan be computed and shown to be equal to 1: given that Billy had\nthrown his rock, his rock would have hit the bottle and shattered it.\nSo this particular counterfactual is true. This procedure for\nevaluating counterfactuals has direct affinities with Lewis\u2019s\nnon-backtracking interpretation of counterfactuals: the surgical\nintervention that sets the variable SH at its hypothetical\nvalue but keeps all other equations unchanged is similar in its\neffects to Lewis\u2019s small miracle that realises the\ncounterfactual antecedent but preserves the past.\n\nIn general, to evaluate a counterfactual, say \u201cIf it were the\ncase that X1,\u2026,Xn, then\n\u2026\u201d, one replaces the original equation for each variable\nXi with a new equation stipulating its hypothetical\nvalue,while keeping the other equations unchanged; then one computes\nthe values for the remaining variables to see whether they make the\nconsequent true. This technique of replacing an equation with a\nhypothetical value set by a \u2019surgical intervention\u2019\nenables us to capture the notion of counterfactual dependence between\nvariables:\n\n(8)\nA variable Y counterfactually depends on a\nvariable X in a model if and only if it is actually the case\nthat X = x and Y = y and there exist\nvalues x\u2032 \u2260 x and y\u2032 \u2260 y\nsuch that replacing the equation for X with X =\n    x\u2032 yields Y = y\u2032.\n\nOf course, so far we just have something we are calling a\n\u2018causal model\u2019, \u27e8V, E\u27e9; we haven\u2019t\nbeen told anything about how to extract causal information from it. As\nshould be obvious by now, the basic recipe is going to be roughly as\nfollows: the truth of \u2018c causes e\u2019 (or\n\u2018c is an actual cause of e\u2019), where c\nand e are particular, token events, will be a matter of the\ncounterfactual relationship, as encoded by the model, between two\nvariables X and Y, where the occurrence of c is\nrepresented by a structural equation of the form X =\nx1 and the occurrence of e is represented by a\nstructural equation of the form Y = y1. We can see\nstraightaway, however, that we can\u2019t straightforwardly identify\ncausation with counterfactual dependence as defined in (8) above.\nThat would get us the truth of \u201cSuzy\u2019s throw caused her\nrock to hit the bottle\u201d (ST = 1 and SH = 1, and,\nsince SH = ST is a member of E, we know that if we\nreplace ST = 1 with ST = 0, we get SH = 0). But\nit won\u2019t get us, for example, the truth of \u201cSuzy\u2019s\nthrow caused the bottle to shatter\u201d, since if we replace\nST = 1 with ST = 0 and work through the equations we\nstill end up with BS = 1.\n\nHow, then, might we define \u2018actual causation\u2019 using the\nstructural equations framework? We\u2019ll get there by considering\nhow SEF deals with cases of late preemption such as the Suzy and Billy\ncase. Halpern and Pearl (2001, 2005), Hitchcock (2001), and Woodward\n(2003) all give roughly the same treatment of late preemption. The key\nto their treatment is the employment of a certain procedure for\ntesting the existence of a causal relation. The procedure is to look\nfor an intrinsic process connecting the putative cause and effect;\nsuppress the influence of their non-intrinsic surroundings by\n\u2018freezing\u2019 those surroundings as they actually are; and\nthen subject the putative cause to a counterfactual test. So, for\nexample, to test whether Suzy\u2019s throwing a rock caused the\nbottle to shatter, we should examine the process running from\nST through SH to BS; hold fix at its actual value\n(that is, 0) the variable BH which is extrinsic to this\nprocess; and then wiggle the variable ST to see if it changes\nthe value of BS. The last steps involve evaluating the\ncounterfactual \u201cIf Suzy hadn\u2019t thrown a rock and\nBilly\u2019s rock hadn\u2019t hit the bottle, the bottle would not\nhave shattered\u201d. It is easy to see that this counterfactual is\ntrue. In contrast, when we carry out a similar procedure to test\nwhether Billy\u2019s throwing a rock caused the bottle to shatter,we\nare required to consider the counterfactual \u201cIf Billy\nhadn\u2019t thrown his rock and Suzy\u2019s rock had hit the bottle,\nthe bottle would not shattered\u201d. This counterfactual is false.\nIt is the difference in the truth-values of these two counterfactuals\nthat explains the fact that it was Suzy\u2019s rock throwing, and not\nBilly\u2019s, that caused the bottle to shatter. (A similar theory is\ndeveloped in Yablo 2002 and 2004 though not in the structural\nequations framework.)\n\nHitchcock (2001) presents a useful regimentation of this reasoning. He\ndefines a route between two variables X and Z in\nthe set V to be an ordered sequence of variables <X,\nY1,\u2026, Yn, Z> such\nthat each variable in the sequence is in V and is a parent of\nits successor in the sequence. A variable Y (distinct from\nX and Z) is intermediate between X and\nZ if and only if it belongs to some route between X and\nZ. Then he introduces the new concept of an active causal\nroute:\n\n(9)\nThe route <X, Y1,\u2026,\nYn, Z> is active in the causal\nmodel <V, E> if and only if Z depends\ncounterfactually on X within the new system of equations\nE\u2019 constructed from E as follows: for all Y\nin V, if Y is intermediate between X and Z\nbut does not belong to the route <X,\nY1,\u2026, Yn, Z>,\nthen replace the equation for Y with a new equation that sets\nY equal to its actual value in E. (If there are no\nintermediate variables that do not belong to this route, then\nE\u2019 is just E.) (Hitchcock 2001: 286).\n\nThis definition generalises the informal idea sketched in the example\nof Suzy and Billy. <ST, SH, BS> is an active causal route\nbecause when we hold BH fixed at its actual value\n(Billy\u2019s rock doesn\u2019t hit the bottle), BS\ncounterfactually depends on ST. By contrast, the route\n<BT, BH, BS> is not active because when we hold SH\nfixed at its actual value (Suzy\u2019s rock does hit the bottle),\nBS does not counterfactually depend on BT.\n\nIn terms of the notion of an active causal route, Hitchcock defines\nactual or token causation in the following terms:\n\n(10)\nIf c and e are distinct actual events and X\nand Z are binary variables whose values represent the\noccurrence and non-occurrence of these events, then c is a\ncause of e if and only if there is an active causal route\nfrom X to Z in an appropriate causal model <V,\n    E>.\n\n(We shall return to the notion of an \u2018appropriate causal\nmodel\u2019 in\n \u00a75.3\n below.)\n\nAs stated, (10) doesn\u2019t handle cases of symmetric\noverdetermination \u2013 as when Suzy and Billy both throw their\nrocks independently, each throw is sufficient for the bottle to break,\nand both rocks hit the bottle \u2013 so neither throw preempts the\nother, since neither throw is on an active route as defined in (9).\nTo deal with such cases, Hitchcock weakens (10) by replacing the\n\u2018active route\u2019 in (10) with the notion of a weakly\nactive route (2001: 290). The essential idea here that there is a\nweakly active route between X and Z just when Z\ncounterfactually depends on X under the freezing of some\npossible, not necessarily actual, values of the variables that are not\non the route from X to Z. Intuitively, to recover\ncounterfactual dependence between Suzy\u2019s throw and the\nshattering we hold fixed BT = 0: had Suzy not thrown in the model\nwhere Billy doesn\u2019t throw, the bottle would not have\nshattered. Similarly for Billy\u2019s throw.\n\nThe basic strategy deployed here to deal with both preemption and\nsymmetric overdetermination bears an obvious similarity to\nLewis\u2019s quasi-dependence solution to the late preemption\nproblem. Lewis resorts to quasi-dependence because the shattering of\nthe bottle (e) does not counterfactually depend on Suzy\u2019s\nthrow (c), thanks to what would have happened had she not\nthrown (viz, Billy\u2019s rock would have shattered the bottle\ninstead). e quasi-depends on c, however, because of the\nfact that in a possible world with the same laws where the intrinsic\ncharacter of the process from c to e is the same but\nBilly doesn\u2019t throw, there is the required counterfactual\ndependence. \u2018Freezing\u2019 variables that are not intrinsic to\nthe c-e process at their actual values (in late\npreemption cases) \u2013 e.g. freezing BH at 0 \u2013 turns\nroughly the same trick. The core difference is that Lewis\u2019s\nsolution involves appealing to the truth of a perfectly ordinary\ncounterfactual (\u201cIf Suzy had not thrown, \u2026\u201d) at a\npossible world where some actual events (e.g. Billy\u2019s hit)\ndon\u2019t occur, while the structural-equations solution involves\nappealing to the truth of a counterfactual with a special kind of\nantecedent (\u201cHad Suzy not thrown and Billy\u2019s rock still\nnot hit, \u2026\u201d). Hitchcock calls these \u2018explicitly\nnonforetracking\u2019 (ENF) counterfactuals. (Similarly for symmetric\noverdetermination, where we \u2018freeze\u2019 BT at 0\n\u2013 this time a non-actual value \u2013 to recover counterfactual\ndependence between Suzy\u2019s throw and the shattering.)\n5.2 SEF and Counterfactuals\n\nThose who have pursued the SEF approach to providing an analysis of\n\u2018actual\u2019 causation \u2013 that is, the causal relation\nbetween actual, particular events \u2013 have had very little to say\nabout the semantics of the counterfactuals that underpin SEF. Some\nauthors (e.g. Hitchcock 2001) explicitly \u2013 and many authors\nimplicitly \u2013 assume a broadly Lewisian approach to\ncounterfactuals, so that the structural equations are representations\nof relations of facts about counterfactual dependence \u2013 as\ndescribed above \u2013 whose truth conditions are broadly\nLewisian.\n\nOn the other hand, one might go in the other direction, using the SEF\napproach to deliver the truth conditions for counterfactuals by\ntreating the structural equations (such as SH = ST) as\nrepresentations of causal dependency relationships, which in\nturn deliver those truth conditions (Galles & Pearl 1998, Woodward\nand Hitchcock 2003, Schulz 2011, Briggs 2012). Relatedly, one might\neschew a Lewisian, miracle-based conception of an intervention and\ndefine interventions in explicitly causal terms (see e.g. Woodward and\nHitchcock 2003: 12\u201313).\n\nThe choice between these two different ways of proceeding connects\nwith the broader debate about whether causation should be analysed in\nterms of counterfactuals or vice versa. Lewis, of course, takes the\nformer approach. One attraction of doing so \u2013 at least for him\n\u2013 is that it fits within a broadly Humean agenda: since\ncausation is a modal notion, it threatens the thesis of Humean\nsupervenience (Lewis 1986a, ix) unless it can somehow we cashed out in\nterms of similarity relations between worlds, where those similarity\nrelations do not appeal in turn to causal (or other Humean\nsupervenience-violating) features of worlds. Lewis\u2019s analysis of\ncounterfactuals, together with his analysis of laws, turns that trick.\nBy contrast, other authors have argued that the trick simply cannot be\nturned: we cannot analyse counterfactuals without appealing to\ncausation (Edgington 2011).\n\nThere are deep metaphysical issues at stake here, then: one might view\nthe SEF approach as offering a more sophisticated variant of\nLewis\u2019s approach that shares the reductionist aspirations of\nthat approach. Or one might \u2013 especially if one is sceptical\nabout the prospects for those reductionist aspirations \u2013 take\nthe SEF approach in anti-reductionist spirit, viewing it not as a way\nof defining causation in non-causal terms but rather as a way of\nextracting useful and sophisticated causal information from an\ninherently causal model of a given complex situation.\n5.3 Models and Reality\n\nIt is a general feature of the SEF approach that the model need not\ninclude as variables all of the factors that are relevant to the\neffect under consideration (and indeed no model never does \u2013\nthere are just too many factors). In the Billy/Suzy model above, for\nexample, there are no variables describing the actual and possible\nstates corresponding to causal intermediaries between Billy\u2019s or\nSuzy\u2019s throwing (or not throwing) and their respective rocks\nhitting (or not hitting) the bottle. So what determines which\nvariables should and should not be included in the model in order to\nuncover the causal relationships between the variables we\u2019re\ninterested in?\n\nIt\u2019s important to stress that there is no uniquely correct model\nto be had for any given situation. A model that, for example,\ninterpolated large numbers of intermediaries between Suzy\u2019s\nthrow and her rock\u2019s hitting the bottle would reveal more of the\ncausal structure of both the actual situation and various different\ncounterfactual alternatives. But that doesn\u2019t make it the\n\u2018right\u2019 model for considering the causal status of\nBilly\u2019s and Suzy\u2019s respective throws with respect to the\nshattering of the bottle. Such a model would deliver the same result\nas the simple one described above, and so the additional variables\nwould simply be an unnecessary complication. On the other hand, there\nare limits on what we can leave out. For example, a causal model that\njust included ST and BS as variables would not deliver\nthe result that Suzy\u2019s throw caused the bottle to shatter, since\nthat counterfactual is not true on this model. (To get it to come out\ntrue, we need to include BH and hold it fixed at its actual\nvalue, BH = 0.)\n\nSo what are the constraints on causal models, such that they\naccurately represent the causal facts that we\u2019re interested in\n(Halpern and Hitchcock 2010: \u00a7\u00a74\u20135)? Various authors\nhave proposed constraints that tell us what count as (to use\nHitchcock\u2019s term) \u2018apt\u2019 models, many of which are\nanalogues of Lewis\u2019s constraints and for the same reasons,\nnamely to ensure that there is no spurious counterfactual dependence.\nThus Hitchcock (2001: 287) proposes that the values of variables\nshould not represent events that bear logical or metaphysical\nrelations to one another, and Blanchard and Schaffer (2017: 182)\npropose that the values allotted should represent intrinsic\ncharacterisations. Hitchcock (2001: 287) also proposes that the\nvariables should not be allotted values \u2018that one is not willing\nto take seriously\u2019 (about which more below). Halpern and\nHitchcock (2010) add a \u2018stability\u2019 constraint: adding\nadditional variables should not overturn the causal verdicts. (This\nconstraint addresses the problem of the \u2018model\u2019 described\nabove that just includes ST and BS; that model delivers\na verdict, namely that Suzy\u2019s throw doesn\u2019t cause the\nbottle to shatter, which is overturned by adding additional\nvariables.) And Hitchcock (2007: 503) proposes the constraint that the\nmodel \u201cshould include enough variables to capture the essential\nstructure of the situation being modeled\u201d. (Though if one had\nreductionist aspirations, this constraint would appear to render\none\u2019s analysis of causation viciously circular, since the\n\u2018essential structure\u2019 of the situation is presumably its\nessential causal structure \u2013 just what a causal model is\nsupposed to deliver.)\n\nPrecisely what the constraints should be on \u2018apt\u2019 or\n\u2018appropriate\u2019 models is a matter of ongoing philosophical\ndebate (Blanchard and Schaffer 2017: \u00a71.3). The focus here is on\nconstraints that guarantee that a model does not deliver spurious\nresults (e.g. that Suzy\u2019s throw doesn\u2019t cause the bottle\nto shatter). However, SEF is also used as a practical tool in\nscientific inquiry, and this brings additional normative questions\ninto play concerning the choice of variables and their range of\npermitted values. In the context of assigning blame for the broken\nbottle, for example, it would not be relevant to include the strength\nof the bottle\u2019s glass as a variable; by contrast, a local shop\nowner \u2013 tired of Suzy and Billy\u2019s vandalism (they\nroutinely break his shop window as well as any bottles they come\nacross) \u2013 might be very interested in the question of what\nstrength of glass might suffice to withstand their rock-throwing. (See\ne.g. Woodward 2016, Hitchcock 2017, and \u2013 for a practical\nexample in the context of causal inference in machine learning \u2013\nChalupka, Eberhardt & Perona 2017.) \n5.4 SEF and Chancy Causation\n\nAs we saw in\n \u00a71.4\n above, Lewis revised his 1973 account of causation to take account of\nchancy causation. Any account of causation that is based on the idea\nthat causes increase the chances of their effects encounters two main\nproblems: chance-increase is neither necessary nor sufficient for\ncausation. (Case 1: The doctor reduces the patient\u2019s very high\nchance of a heart attack by drastic surgery. Unfortunately, the\nsurgery itself causes the patient to have a heart attack. The surgery\nlowers the chance of, but causes, the heart attack. Case 2: Billy and\nSuzy are throwing rocks at the bottle again. Each of their throws\nincreases the chance of the bottle shattering, but Suzy\u2019s throw\npre-empts Billy\u2019s. Billy\u2019s throw raises the chance of, but\ndoes not cause, the bottle\u2019s shattering.)\n\nThe first kind of case can (perhaps) be dealt with by Lewis\u2019s\nmodified 1973 account, by finding some intermediate event d\nsuch that the surgery raises the chance of d and d in\nturn raises the chance of the heart attack. But it can\u2019t deal\nwith the second kind of case: Billy\u2019s throw meets Lewis\u2019s\nsufficient condition for chancy causation and so the modified 1973\naccount erroneously counts it as a cause (Menzies 1996). This is a\nproblem that Lewis saw for his own account and never solved: his\nlater, 2000 account of causation as \u2018influence\u2019 assumes\ndeterminism (2000: n.1; Lewis 2004a: 79\u201380) and so ignores the\nproblem. Examples of both kinds have been the subject of extensive\ndiscussion in the context of both counterfactual and probabilistic\ntheories of causation. (For discussions about how best to deal with\nthem within theories that don\u2019t assume determinism, see Barker\n2004; Beebee 2004a; Dowe 2000, 2004; Hitchcock 2004; Kvart 2004;\nNoordhof 1999, 2004; Ramachandran 1997, 2004.)\n\nSEF accounts similarly overwhelmingly assume determinism: as with\nLewis\u2019s original 1973 account, the basic building block of such\naccounts is non-chancy counterfactual dependence. However there have\nbeen recent attempts to extend SEF-based analyses to cover chancy\ncausation by Fenton-Glynn (Glynn 2011, Fenton-Glynn 2017; see also the\nentry on\n Probabilistic Causation,\n \u00a74.4).\n5.5 Defaults and Deviants\n\nIn\n \u00a74\n we saw two examples of the kinds of case that have motivated some\nauthors to endorse contextualism. The examples exhibit different\nfeatures. In the case of the theft of the coconut cake, the idea is\nthat in different contexts of utterance, the very same causal claim\n\u2013 \u201cSuzy\u2019s theft of the coconut cake from the shop\ncaused her subsequent illness\u201d \u2013 can vary in truth value,\ndepending on whether the context determines that what is at issue is\nSuzy\u2019s criminality (theft rather than purchase) or, instead,\nwhich item she stole (coconut cake rather than Bath bun). The case of\nthe gardener and the Queen, by contrast, is a case where the (alleged)\ncause (the gardener\u2019s omission) and non-cause (the\nQueen\u2019s) stand in the same counterfactual relationship to the\neffect, and yet judgements differ with respect to their causal\nstatus.\n\nA major focus of the debate within the SEF approach has been the\nsecond kind of case \u2013 cases of what Menzies calls\n\u2018counterfactual isomorphs\u2019 (Menzies 2017), where two\ndifferent scenarios have isomorphic causal models and yet our\njudgements about what causes what differs in the two different\nscenarios. For example, consider a case of \u2018bogus\nprevention\u2019 (Hiddleston 2005): believing that Killer has\npreviously poisoned Victim\u2019s coffee, Bodyguard puts an antidote\ninto it. However, in fact Killer had a change of heart and\ndidn\u2019t poison the coffee. Victim survives \u2013 but his\nsurvival was not, surely, caused by Bodyguard\u2019s action, for\nthere was no threat to Victim\u2019s life that Bodyguard neutralized.\nIt is possible, however, to construct a causal model of this case that\nis isomorphic to a standard case of symmetric overdetermination: Billy\nand Suzy are throwing rocks again, but this time both of their throws\nhit the bottle at the same time, so that each is sufficient for its\nshattering and neither hit pre-empts the other. In that case\n(allegedly), we identify both Billy\u2019s and Suzy\u2019s throws as\ncauses of the bottle\u2019s shattering (Blanchard and Schaffer 2017:\n185\u20136).\n\nOne broad line of response to the problem of counterfactual isomorphs\nhas been to distinguish between \u2018default\u2019 (or\n\u2018normal\u2019) and \u2018deviant\u2019 events, and to build\nthis distinction into the way in which causal information is extracted\nfrom the model. For example, Menzies\u2019 approach exploits the\nmachinery seen above with respect to Hithcock\u2019s solution to the\nproblem of symmetric overdetermination, which involves fixing\n\u2018off-path\u2019 variables at non-actual values. Menzies\u2019\nsuggestion is that we fix those variables at their \u2018most\nnormal\u2019 values, so that in effect we evaluate the relevant\ncounterfactuals from the perspective of a world where those normal\nvalues are actualised rather than from the perspective of the actual\nworld (Menzies 2004, 2007, 2009).\n\nIntuitively, the basic idea is that (in the overdetermination case)\nthe \u2018most normal\u2019 value of each of BT and ST\nis 0 (throwing rocks at bottles isn\u2019t normal!), so from the\nperspective of a world where ST = 0, BS counterfactually\ndepends on ST (and similarly for BT). So both\nBilly\u2019s and Suzy\u2019s throws count as causes of the\nbottle\u2019s shattering. Poisoning someone\u2019s coffee is also\nnot normal. So we hold Killer\u2019s failure to poison the coffee\nfixed (so in this case the \u2018most normal\u2019 world is just the\nactual world as far as the poisoning is concerned), which delivers the\nright result that Victim\u2019s survival does not counterfactually\ndepend on Bodyguard\u2019s administering the antidote. (See Hitchcock\n2007 for a different solution that trades on the default/deviant\ndistinction.)\n\nIt is hard to see, however, how there could be a univocal and\nreasonably well defined notion of \u2018normality\u2019 that would\ndeliver clear verdicts on what the \u2018normal\u2019 or\n\u2018default\u2019 values of variables are, and hence would deliver\nan objectively \u2018correct\u2019 set of models, all of which\ndeliver the same verdict for the same situation (Blanchard and\nSchaffer 2017: \u00a7\u00a72 and 3). Blanchard and Schaffer argue that\n\u2018default-relativity\u2019 does not solve some of the problems\nit was supposed to solve; more importantly, however, they argue that\nthe alleged cases of isomorphic causal models are not really genuine\ncases in the first place: they arise because one (or both) of the\nrelevant models falls foul of the independently-motivated criteria for\n\u2018aptness\u2019 (see\n \u00a75.3\n above). For example, one such criterion is that the variables not be\nallotted values \u2018that one is not willing to take\nseriously\u2019 (Hitchcock 2001: 287). But the case of the gardener\nand the Queen violates that criterion: the possibility of the Queen\nwatering my flowers is, precisely, one that we do not take seriously.\nIn other cases, they argue, the isomorphism results from deploying\n\u2018impoverished\u2019 models: models that fail to include enough\nvariables to adequately represent the \u2018essential causal\nstructure\u2019 of the situation being modelled (Blanchard and\nSchaffer 2017: \u00a73).\n\nBlanchard and Schaffer\u2019s own view is that, insofar as our causal\njudgements do exhibit something like default-relativity, this is due\nto cognitive heuristics that engender biases in our judgements.\nAlternatives to \u2018deviant\u2019 events tend to \u2018leap\nout\u2019 at us \u2013 they are salient because they are easy to\nimagine \u2013 whereas alternatives to \u2018default\u2019 events\ndon\u2019t. Blanchard and Schaffer\u2019s view can thus be seen as a\nversion of invariantism, where the kinds of case that are supposed to\nmotivate contextualism are accommodated through features of our causal\ntalk and thought that are extraneous to the (non-norm-dependent)\nconcept of causation.\n\nA host of issues remain in this area. One is whether or not we should\ndemand a uniquely \u2018correct\u2019 answer to the question of what\ncount as \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018default\u2019 values of\nvariables in the first place; perhaps, if for example there are\ndifferent dimensions of \u2018normality\u2019 (statistical\nlikelihood, consonance with moral or legal norms, etc.), we should\nembrace the idea that two apt models of the very same situation might\ndeliver different and equally correct results, depending on how the\nnormal or default values are set \u2013 which in turn would depend on\nthe context (e.g. the purpose for which the model is being\ndeployed).\n\nMore general issues that lie in the background of the debate about\n\u2018default-relativity\u2019 include whether the purpose of the\nconcept of causation is best served by an \u2018egalitarian\u2019 or\n\u2018invariantist\u2019 concept of causation or rather by one that\ntakes the concept to enshrine normative considerations. Hitchcock\n(2017), for example, argues that since our interest in what causes\nwhat is, in essence, an interest in what kinds of intervention would\nbring about the kinds of results we want, we should take the latter\nline. A still more general issue is whether there is just one concept\nof causation at which all of the accounts on the table are or should\nbe aiming, or instead several (Hall 2004, McDonnell 2018). Or perhaps\ncausation is what Nancy Cartwright (following Neurath) calls a\n\u2018Ballung\u2019 concept: \u201ca concept with rough, shifting,\nporous boundaries, a congestion of different ideas and implications\nthat can in various combinations be brought into focus for different\npurposes and in different contexts\u201d (2017: 136).\n",
