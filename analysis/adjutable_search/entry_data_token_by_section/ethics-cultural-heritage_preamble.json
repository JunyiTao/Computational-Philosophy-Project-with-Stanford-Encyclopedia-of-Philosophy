    "main_text": "\n\nDo members of cultural groups have special claims to own or control\nthe products of the cultures to which they belong? Is there something\nmorally wrong with employing artistic styles that are distinctive of a\nculture to which you do not belong? What is the relationship between\ncultural heritage and group identity? Is there a coherent and morally\nacceptable sense of cultural group membership in the first place? Is\nthere a universal human heritage to which everyone has a claim?\nQuestions such as these concern the ethics of cultural heritage (or\nheritage ethics, for short). This entry seeks to provide an overview\nof the philosophical work on topics in heritage ethics, as well as\nintroduce readers to some of the most philosophically relevant\nliterature from other disciplines.\n\nRunning through the specific topics discussed below is a set of common\nthemes. One theme concerns a tension between universalism and cultural\nspecificity. On the one hand, there is a pull towards conceiving of\ncultural heritage as universally valuable, grounding consequent rights\nor permissions for all concerning its use and ownership. On the other\nhand, there is a push for culturally specific rights and restrictions\nthat recognize the special claims of particular cultural groups. A\nrelated theme concerns the distribution of power among cultural groups\nand the role that colonial dynamics have played in establishing\ncurrent patterns of access to, and control over, cultural heritage. A\nthird theme concerns how we understand the composition and boundaries\nof cultural groups, and whether any such account can avoid charges of\nessentialism (the idea that there is a necessary \u201cessence\u201d\nto cultural group membership). As we will see, specific controversies\nover cultural property, repatriation, cultural appropriation, and\nheritage preservation, are each shaped by these recurrent themes.\n\nOn the one hand, cultural heritage is about the past, as suggested by\nthe ubiquitous framing of heritage ethics topics in terms of the\nquestion \u201cWho owns the past?\u201d But on the other hand,\ncultural heritage is just as much about the present and the future:\nabout how culture is embroiled in contemporary moral controversies,\nand about what our cultural legacy will be.\n",
