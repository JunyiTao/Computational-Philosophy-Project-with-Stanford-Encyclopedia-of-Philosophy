    "main_text": "Explanatory Roles for Attention || Attention and Other Minds\n3.3 Attention and Other Minds\n\nThere are empirical results, coming from developmental psychology,\nwhich are suggestive of an intimate link between the development of\nvarious abilities related to attention and the development of various\ncapacities that are involved in understanding the mental states that\nare expressed in interactions between the infant and its\ncaregiver.\n\nAn ability to appreciate what others are attending to appears to be a\ncrucial stage in a normal infant\u2019s development towards\nunderstanding the fact that its caregivers\u2019 utterances have\nreferential intentions behind them. More generally, capacities for\nattention develop at important milestones on the route to the\nacquisition of some distinctively human cognitive capacities (Moore\nand Dunham, 1995). There is a distinctive developmental pathway in\nwhich normal human infants develop an ability and a willingness to\nattend to their mother, an ability and willingness to attend to the\nthing that she is attending to, and then, most importantly, an ability\nand willingness to enter into episodes in which there is a third\nobject that mother and child are attending to jointly, with\nmutual understanding of the fact that their attention is shared\n(Reddy, 2010, Trevarthen, 2011). In these episodes infants and\ncaregivers employ complex cues, involving speech, gaze-following, and\npointing.\n\nThere is good evidence that the child\u2019s progression along this\npathway is related to its development of abilities to respond\nappropriately to the mental states of others, and to the development\nof its ability to acquire new vocabulary on the basis of an\nunderstanding of what the words used by its mother refer to. A\nlongitudinal study suggests that the earlier stages in this pathway\nare predictive of the age at which infants reach the later ones\n\u2013 thereby providing some evidence for the hypothesis that this\nsequence is a causal one \u2013 with the mastery at twelve months of\npointing as a means to direct the attention of others being predictive\nof false belief understanding at the age of fifty months, even when\nfactors relating to temperament and language are factored out (Sodian\n& Kristen-Antonow, 2015). Another source of evidence comes from\nthe fact that the arrested development of these attention-involving\nabilities is a revealing marker of the impairments suffered by\nautistic children (Kanner, 1943, Hobson and Hobson, 2011).\u00a0\nFurther evidence may also come from the fact that a lack of such\nabilities is related to limitations in the mental-state attribution\nabilities of non-human primates, although this last claim is more\ncontroversial (Call & Tomasello, 2005).\n\nSome progress has been made towards extracting philosophical lessons\nfrom the empirical work indicating that joint attention has a role to\nplay here, in the explanation of distinctively human aspects of\ncognitive and social development, and also \u2013 once that\ndevelopment is complete \u2013 in the explanation of the way in which\nsome elementary social phenomena are transacted. (For several\ndevelopmental examples, see the papers collected in Eilan, et\nal. 2005, and Seemann 2011; for a discussion of joint attention\nin adult cases of shared intention, see Fiebich and Gallagher, 2012,\nwho argue that jointly attending has a basic, elementary status, as\nthe most minimal instance of a joint action.)\n\nOne of the points at which philosophical difficulties arise is in\ncharacterizing the sharedness of the attention that is\nimplicated in this developmental trajectory. Christopher Peacocke has\nargued that the way in which joint attention episodes are shared\ninvolves a kind of reciprocal recognition of the other\u2019s\nrecognition of one\u2019s own attention, and that it therefore\ninvolves a kind of mutual openness that is analogous to the openness\nof \u2018common knowledge\u2019, as that notion figures in\nphilosophical analyses of communication and convention (see the entry\non\n convention).\n Since joint attention is achieved by young children, its achievement\ncannot plausibly be thought to make any sophisticated intellectual\ndemands. Peacocke therefore argues that awareness of reciprocated\nopenness must be more fundamental than the intellectual achievement of\ncommon knowledge.\u00a0 He suggests that it should instead be\nunderstood as a variety of perceptual awareness that makes\nsuch common knowledge possible (Peacocke, 2005). John Campbell shares\nPeacocke\u2019s view of joint attention as being a perceptual\nphenomenon, as opposed to a phenomenon that is achieved when\none\u2019s perception is reflected on in a certain way, but Campbell\ndiffers from Peacocke in taking the person with whom attention is\nshared to be fellow subject of the joint experience, not an\nobject who figures in the content of the experience that each\njoint-attender individually has (Campbell, 2002, Ch. 8).\nCampbell\u2019s attempt to shift the explanation of sharedness from\nthe cognitive to the perceptual domain is rejected by Lucas Battich\nand Bart Geurts (Battich and Guerts, 2020), who suggest that\nCampbell\u2019s view suffers from problems that originate in his\nrelational conception of perception. They therefore claim that the\nissues here cast light on the long-running debates between\nrepresentation-based and relation-based theories of perception (see\nthe entry on\n the problem of perception).\n",
