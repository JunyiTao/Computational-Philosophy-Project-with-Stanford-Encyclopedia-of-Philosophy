    "main_text": "The Epistemological Organization of Developmental Biology\n2. The Epistemological Organization of Developmental Biology\n\nOne recurring theme in the long history of investigations into\ndevelopment is that explaining the ontogeny of form consists of many\ninterrelated questions about diverse phenomena\n (Section 1.2).\n Sometimes philosophers have attempted to compress these questions\ninto one broad problem.\n\n\nThe real question concerning metazoan ontogeny is just how a single\ncell gives rise to the requisite number of differentiated cell\nlineages with all the right inductive developmental interactions\nrequired to reproduce the form of the mature organism (Moss 2002:\n97).\n\nThe central problem of developmental biology is to understand how a\nrelatively simple and homogeneous cellular mass can differentiate into\na relatively complex and heterogeneous organism closely resembling its\nprogenitor(s) in relevant aspects (Robert 2004: 1).\n\n\nThis language is not necessarily incorrect but can lead to skewed\ninterpretations. For example, Philip Kitcher has argued that: \n\n\nIn contemporary developmental biology, there is \u2026 uncertainty\nabout how to focus the big, vague question, How do organisms develop?\n(Kitcher 1993: 115)\n\n\nThis is simply false. While it is true that these questions have been\nmanifested with differing frequency and vigor through history, and the\nability to answer them (as well as the nature of the questions\nthemselves) has been contingent on different research strategies and\nmethods, the issue has not been an unwieldy central problem. But\nscrutinizing the structure of developmental biology\u2019s questions\nis not merely an exercise in clarification. It is crucial for\nunderstanding how the science of developmental biology is\norganized.\n",
