    "main_text": "Paraphrase\n3. Paraphrase\n\nSometimes the effort to render a given original in a given medium\nrequires approximation and elaboration of various sorts, so that any\nrendering of the given original in the given medium will be correct\nonly up to a point and incorrect thereafter (such is approximation)\nand more complex or longwinded than the thing rendered (such is\nelaboration). When this is the case we often call our renderings\nparaphrases of their originals. Sometimes originals and\nparaphrases are both verbal, and the aim of the paraphrase is to\nexplain or exposit the original: think of a lawyer\u2019s paraphrase\nof an obscure statute or a preacher\u2019s paraphrase of a cryptic\nBible passage. Sometimes neither original nor paraphrase is verbal and\nthe aim is to adapt the original in some sense or other:\nthink of a polyphonic paraphrase by Palestrina of a snatch of medieval\nplainsong or the paraphrase of an acanthus leaf in the design of a\nCorinthian capital.\n\nThe effort to translate a literary work from one language to another,\nto render the original work in a language not its own, involves a\ncomplex mixture of exposition and adaptation. Translational rendering\nis especially likely to resort to approximation and\nelaboration\u2014paraphrase\u2014when confronted by metaphors and\nother figures of speech. Yet it is often said that poetry is\nwhat\u2019s lost in translation, to the point where Coleridge\nproposed \u201cuntranslatableness in words of the same language\nwithout injury to the meaning\u201d as \u201cthe infallible test of\na blameless style\u201d (Biographia Literaria, chap. 22). If\nmetaphor is a form of poetry, it might seem to follow that paraphrase\nin words of the same language is impossible or uncalled for\nwhere metaphor is concerned. The American New Critic Cleanth Brooks\nargued as much in a famous essay called \u201cThe Heresy of\nParaphrase\u201d (1947).\n\nNevertheless, there is a familiar way of registering how one takes or\nunderstands a given metaphor, naturally called paraphrase,\nsuch that dispensing with it entirely would condemn\narticulate consumers of metaphor to an unproductive silence. It is\nhard not to sympathize with Stanley Cavell when he writes in\n\u201cAesthetic Problems of Modern Philosophy\u201d (1969):\n\nNow suppose I am asked what someone means who says, \u201cJuliet is\nthe sun.\u201d \u2026 I may say something like: Romeo means that\nJuliet is the warmth of his world; that his day begins with her; that\nonly in her nourishment can he grow. And his declaration suggests that\nthe moon, which other lovers use as an emblem of their love, is merely\nher reflected light, and dead in comparison; and so on. In a word, I\nparaphrase it. Moreover, if I could not provide an explanation of this\nform, that is a very good reason, a perfect reason, for supposing that\nI do not know what it means. Metaphors are paraphrasable.\n\n\nHe adds:\n\nThe \u201cand so on\u201d which ends my example of paraphrase is\nsignificant. It registers what William Empson called the\n\u201cpregnancy\u201d of metaphors, the burgeoning of meaning in\nthem\u2026 The over-reading of metaphors so often complained of, no\ndoubt justly, is a hazard they must run for their high interest.\n\n\nPerhaps we can agree that explications of the sort Cavell has in mind\nexist and have some legitimate role to play in the understanding and\nappreciation of metaphor\u2014and agree to call such explications\nparaphrases\u2014while agreeing to disagree about how they\nrelate to the language they purport to explain.\n\nThe paraphrasability of poetry in general and metaphor in particular\nis an important topic of debate in aesthetics: See Levinson (2001),\nCamp (2006), Hills (2008), Lepore (2009), Lamarque (2015), Currie and\nFrascaroli (2021).\n",
