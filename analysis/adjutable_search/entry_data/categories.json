    "preamble": "\n\nA system of categories is a complete list of highest kinds or genera.\nTraditionally, following Aristotle, these have been thought of as\nhighest genera of entities (in the widest sense of the term), so that\na system of categories undertaken in this realist spirit would ideally\nprovide an inventory of everything there is, thus answering the most\nbasic of metaphysical questions: \u201cWhat is there?\u201d\nSkepticism about our ability to discern a unique system of basic\ncategories of \u2018reality itself\u2019 has led others to approach\ncategory systems not with the aim of cataloging the highest kinds in\nthe world itself, but rather with the aim of elucidating the\ncategories of our conceptual system or language. Thus Kant makes the\nshift to a conceptualist approach by drawing out the categories that\nare a priori necessary for any possible cognition of objects.\nSince such categories are guaranteed to apply to any possible object\nof cognition, they retain a certain sort of ontological import,\nalthough this application is limited to phenomena, not the thing in\nitself. After Kant, it has been common to approach the project of\ncategories in a neutral spirit that Brian Carr (1987, 7) calls\n\u201ccategorial descriptivism\u201d, as describing the categorial\nstructure that the world would have according to our thought,\nexperience, or language, while refraining from making commitments\nabout whether or not these categories are occupied, or are ontically\nfundamental. Edmund Husserl approaches categories in something like\nthis way, since he begins by laying out categories of\nmeanings, which may then be used to draw out\nontological categories (categories of possible objects meant)\nas the correlates of the meaning categories, without concern for any\nempirical matter about whether or not there really are objects of the\nvarious ontological categories discerned.\n\nA system of ontological categories drawn out in any of these modes has\nthe potential for a great many uses in philosophy, but those who would\noffer such systems of categories also face a variety of difficulties.\nThey must address the issue of what the proper methods are by means of\nwhich categories are to be distinguished, how many categories there\nare and what they are, whether or not there is a single summum\ngenus subsuming all other categories, and whether we should\ndistinguish a single system of categories or multiple dimensions of\ncategories \u2013 issues on which there has been little\nagreement.\n\nOver the past hundred years, skepticism about the possibility of\noffering a uniquely true and complete system of ontological categories\nhas led discussion of categories to shift from attempts to offer\ncomplete systems of categories to attempts merely to draw particular\ndistinctions, especially among our conceptual or linguistic\ncategories. Work on category differences, unlike that on category\nsystems, does not generally purport to answer deep metaphysical\nquestions about what things or kinds of things exist; instead,\ncategory differences are typically articulated as a way of diagnosing\nand avoiding various philosophical problems and confusions.\nNonetheless, even those who merely argue for category differences owe\nan account of the conditions under which two concepts, terms, or\nobjects belong to different categories.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Category Systems\n1.1 Aristotelian Realism\n\nPhilosophical interest in categories may be traced back to Aristotle\nwho, in his treatise Categories, attempts to enumerate the\nmost general kinds into which entities in the world divide. He does\nnot begin from a single highest kind, but rather lists the following\nas the ten highest categories of things \u201csaid without any\ncombination\u201d (Categories 1b25):\n\nSubstance (e.g., man, horse)\nQuantity (e.g., four-foot, five-foot)\nQuality (e.g., white, grammatical)\nRelation (e.g., double, half)\nPlace (e.g., in the Lyceum, in the market-place)\nDate (e.g., yesterday, last year)\nPosture (e.g., is lying, is sitting)\nState (e.g., has shoes on, has armor on)\nAction (e.g., cutting, burning)\nPassion (e.g., being cut, being burned)\n\n\nThere are two sorts of substance: a primary substance is, e.g., an\nindividual man or horse; the species (and genera) of these\nindividuals (e.g., man, animal) are secondary\nsubstances. While the ten categories are all equally highest kinds,\nprimary substances nonetheless have a certain sort of priority, since\n\u201call the other things are either said of the primary substances\nas subjects or in them as subjects. So if the primary substances did\nnot exist it would be impossible for any of the other things to\nexist\u201d (Categories 2b4).\n\nElsewhere, in Metaphysics (998b22), Aristotle argues\nexplicitly that there cannot be a highest genus (e.g., of\nbeing or unity) shared by entities of different\ncategories (cf. Ackrill 1963, 81). For a species is defined in terms\nof its subsuming genus and differentia (e.g., man is definable as an\nanimal that is rational), and while the genus (animal) may be\npredicated of the species (man), it may not be predicated of the\ndifferentia (rational). As a result, if being (or unity) were\na genus, no differentiae could be said to have being (or to be one);\nbut \u201cthe differentiae of any genus must each of them both have\nbeing and be one\u201d (Metaphysics 998b22\u20133).\n\nThe ancient Greek term \u2018kategoria\u2019 described what could be\nsaid against someone in a court of law, and indeed Aristotle uses what\ncan be said of or in a subject as a route to\ndistinguishing categories. There is controversy in the literature,\nhowever, about precisely how he arrived at his categories (Studtmann\n2007). On one prominent interpretation, put forward by J. L. Ackrill,\nAristotle arrived at his list of categories by way of distinguishing\n\u201cdifferent questions which may be asked about something\u201d\nand noting \u201cthat only a limited range of answers can be\nappropriately given to any particular question\u201d (Ackrill 1963,\n78\u20139), e.g., the question \u2018what is it\u2019 can only be\nasked of a substance, and only answers describing substances are\nappropriate. The question \u2018how much\u2019, by contrast,\nrequires a quantity for an answer, and so on.\n\nBut although on this interpretation Aristotle seems to have arrived at\nhis categories by considering different sorts of question and answer,\nthe categories he was offering were supposed to be categories of\nentities, not of language; language was just a clue to truths about\nthe world. As J. L. Ackrill writes, Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories \u201cis not primarily or explicitly about names,\nbut about the things that names signify\u2026Aristotle relies\ngreatly on linguistic facts and tests, but his aim is to discover\ntruths about non-linguistic items\u201d (1963, 71).\n\nOther interpretations have also been suggested about how\nAristotle\u2019s categories were derived. Some hold that\nAristotle\u2019s list was arrived at by reflecting on grammatical\ncategories, and assuming a parallelism between structures of language\nand structures of the world (Baumer 1993). But others have developed\ninterpretations that do not consider Aristotle to have arrived at his\ncategories by considering linguistic matters such as grammatical\nstructure or the questions we may ask. Instead, they take them to\narise from more worldly considerations such as which types of entity\nany sensible particular must be related to (Moravcsik 1967). For an\noverview of the interpretive options, see Studtmann (2007).\n\nIn any case, regardless of how the categories were derived,\nAristotle\u2019s approach to categories is generally taken to be in\nthe spirit of what Brian Carr calls \u201ccategorial realism\u201d\n\u2013 an approach conceiving of a system of categories as a list of\nthe highest genera of beings (not merely of language or thought\n\u2013 even if those may be used in deriving the metaphysical\ncategories). As Studtmann (2007) puts it, Aristotle \u201c assumes\nrather than defends a posture of realism with respect to the\nmetaphysical structures of the world\u201d. Given this approach, a\ncomplete system of categories would offer a systematic inventory of\nwhat there is, considered at the most abstract level (although it is\nnot clear whether Aristotle intended his categories to be exhaustive).\nThus on a categorial realist approach, providing a system of\ncategories can be seen as one, or even the central task of\nmetaphysics (cf. Grossman 1983, 3). Such a system of categories may\nalso play a central role in answering individual questions of nature,\nproviding the most general sort of answer to questions of the form\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d, and providing the basis for definitions\nof narrower sorts of things by specifying the most general category\n(genus) under which things of this sort fall, and the differentia that\ndistinguishes them from other things of the same category. This has\nendured as the paradigmatic approach to categories, and several recent\nauthors have offered new theories of categories in this spirit of\nAristotelian realism (see \u00a71.4 below).\n1.2 Kantian Conceptualism\n\nOthers, however, have shied away from this robustly realist approach\nto categories, generally on grounds of skepticism about our ability to\ndiscern intrinsic divisions in \u2018reality itself\u2019, and have\ninstead treated the project of categories as a matter of laying out\nthe highest categories governing our conceptual scheme. This shift in\napproach to what Carr (1987, 6) calls \u201ccategorial\nconceptualism\u201d was made famous by Immanuel Kant. While Kant\nfamously denied that we have access to intrinsic divisions (if any) of\nthe thing in itself that lies behind appearances or phenomena, he held\nthat we can discover the essential categories that govern\nhuman understanding, which are the basis for any possible cognition of\nphenomena. Thus, as H. J. Paton puts it, for Kant \u201cWe can have\na priori knowledge by means of the categories, only if the\ncategories are due to the nature of the mind and are imposed by the\nmind on the objects which it knows\u201d (1936, 258).\n\nIn his Critique of Pure Reason, Kant arrives at his list of\ncategories by first enumerating the forms of possible\njudgment (A70/B95\u2013A93/B109). On this view, objective\nempirical judgments (i.e., empirical judgments which purport to refer\nto objects rather than merely subjective seemings or connections of\nsense impressions, and which purport to be universally valid for all\njudging subjects) are endowed with their objectivity and generality in\nvirtue of the a priori concepts embodied in the relevant forms of\njudgment. If we can identify all of the possible forms of objective\nempirical judgment, we can then hope to use them as the basis to\ndiscover all of the most general concepts or categories that are\nemployed in making such judgments, and thus that are employed in any\ncognition of objects (K\u00f6rner 1955, 48\u201349).\n\nThus in distinguishing his categories, Kant begins from Aristotelian\nlogic in outlining four respects in which one can classify any\njudgment: according to its quantity, quality, relation, or modality.\nIn each of these respects or \u2018moments\u2019 of judgment, there\nare three alternative classifications; thus, e.g., in respect of\nquantity, a judgment may be universal, particular, or singular; in\nrespect of its relation, a judgment may be categorical, hypothetical,\nor disjunctive, and so on. These Aristotelian ways of classifying\njudgments are the clue to discerning the twelve correlated concepts of\nthe understanding. So, e.g., from noting that all judgments are either\nuniversal (e.g., All swans are white), particular (e.g., Some swans\nare white) or singular (e.g., Cygmund is white), we can arrive at the\nthree corresponding categories of quantity: unity, plurality, and\ntotality. Via this route, Kant ultimately distinguishes twelve pure\nconcepts of the understanding (A80/B106), divided into four classes of\nthree:\n\nQuantity\n\n\nUnity\nPlurality\nTotality\n \nQuality\n\n\nReality\nNegation\nLimitation\n \nRelation\n\n\nInherence and Subsistence (substance and accident)\nCausality and Dependence (cause and effect)\nCommunity (reciprocity)\n \n\nModality\n\n\nPossibility\nExistence\nNecessity\n \n\n\nThe categories are presented as forming a single exhaustive list, with\nthe four classes of categories imposing four different forms of unity\non the object known (Paton 1936, 295\u20139). Thus, one may\nseparately inquire after an object\u2019s quantity, quality,\nrelation, and modality, receiving one of the three sub-answers in each\ncase on the way to a more complete characterization of the object.\n\nAlthough these are categories of the understanding, they nonetheless\nretain a certain sort of ontological import, as it is a\npriori that they apply universally to all objects of possible\ncognition (A79/B105). In this way, by delineating the concepts that\nare a priori necessary for the cognition of objects,\nwe can acquire knowledge of categories governing any possible\nobject of cognition, and so acquire a sort of descriptive set\nof ontological categories, though these must be understood explicitly\nas categories of objects of possible cognition, not of the\nthing in itself. Thus Kant was able to treat his system of concepts as\na system of categories in something like the Aristotelian sense,\n\u201cfor our primary purpose is the same as his [Aristotle\u2019s],\nalthough widely diverging from it in manner of execution\u201d\n(A80/B105). Nonetheless, it is clear that for Kant the categories find\ntheir original source in principles of human understanding, not in\nintrinsic divisions in mind-independent reality, and are discoverable\nby paying attention to possible forms of human judgment, not by study\nof the world itself, nor by study of our contingent manners of\nspeaking. An approach like Kant\u2019s has been defended more\nrecently by P. F. Strawson and others following him, who undertake the\nproject of \u201cdescriptive metaphysics\u201d, which is concerned\nwith describing \u201cthe most general features of our conceptual\nstructure\u201d (1959 [1963], xiii), thus providing more general and\ndurable results than we might expect analyses of language to give us.\n\n1.3 Husserlian Descriptivism\n\nEdmund Husserl introduced two sorts of innovation to the study of\ncategories. First, while Aristotle used language as a clue to\nontological categories, and Kant treated concepts as the route to\ncategories of objects of possible cognition, Husserl explicitly\ndistinguished categories of meanings from categories of\nobjects, and attempted to draw out the law-like correlations\nbetween categories of each sort (Smith 2007, 139ff.). Secondly,\nwhereas Aristotle and Kant each lay out a single system of categories,\nHusserl distinguishes two ways of arriving at top-level ontological\nclassifications: by formalization and by\ngeneralization, yielding two separate, orthogonal, systems of\ncategories, in two different dimensions (cf. Smith 2004, chapter\n8).\n\nHusserl is careful to distinguish categories of meanings (by\nway of which we can think about the highest kinds or\n\u2018essences\u2019 of objects) from the categories meant\n\u2013 the latter are the categories of objects, or\nontological categories, considered as the highest essences\nthat entities might have: \u201cby \u2018categories\u2019 we can\nunderstand, on the one hand, concepts in the sense of meanings, but on\nthe other also, and to better effect, the formal essences themselves\nwhich find their expression in these meanings\u201d (1913 [1962],\n61\u20132). But although the two sorts of categories must be\ndistinguished, according to Husserl categories of the two sorts are\nessentially correlated (see below), so we can learn about one by way\nof the other.\n\nRegardless of whether we are studying categories of meanings or of\nobjects, Husserl is quite clear that the study of categories, for him,\nis an entirely a priori matter; the categories of meanings\nand objects alike \u201carise \u2026 solely in relation to our\nvarying thought-functions: their concrete basis is solely to be found\nin possible acts of thought, as such, or in the correlates which can\nbe grasped in these\u201d (1913 [2000], 237). As he puts it later, in\nthe Ideas, the study of categories is a study of essences,\nbased in essential insights about the types of meanings and\ncorrelative types of things. Such studies of essence may be conducted\nby way of imaginative variation of cases, independently of any matter\nof fact, including whether or not there actually is anything\nof the ontological kinds distinguished (1913 [1962], 51).\nThus Husserl\u2019s ontological categories, in this sense, are\ndescriptive categories of highest essences of possible things\n(that might fall under those essences), and do not purport to provide\nan inventory of what things actually exist (as a matter of\nempirical fact).\n\nHusserl provides an extensive discussion of categories of meaning in\nthe Logical Investigations, arguing that differences in\ncategories of meaning (which seem to be more like syntactic than\nsemantic categories) can be distinguished by noting where nonsense\nresults from substituting one term for another. E.g., in the sentence\n\u201cThis tree is green\u201d we may substitute \u201cchair\u201d\n\u2013 but not \u201ccareless\u201d \u2013 for \u201ctree\u201d\nwithout turning sense into nonsense, marking the difference between\nthe meaning categories of nominative material and\nadjectival material (1913 [2000], 511\u2013512).\nHusserl\u2019s understanding of \u2018nonsense\u2019 is rather\nstrict: he counts only those strings of words that are\nsyntactically incorrect (so that they form a mere \u2018heap\nof words\u2019 and cannot be combined into any unified meaning\n(Husserl 1913 [2000], 522)) as strictly nonsensical, and thus as signs\nof differences in categories of meaning. (Husserl repeatedly\ndistinguishes the nonsense of verbal formations like \u201ca round\nor\u201d (in which no unified meaning emerges) from cases of mere\nabsurdity such as \u201ca round square\u201d, in which the\nexpression has a unified meaning, although it is a priori\nthat no object can correspond to the expression (1913 [2000],\n516\u201317)).\n\nCorrelated with the categories of meanings are ontological\ncategories; e.g., object, state of affairs, unit, plurality, number,\nand relation are (formal) categories that categorize objects, not\nmeanings (Husserl 1913 [2000], 237). Categories of the two sorts are,\naccording to Husserl, connected by \u2018ideal laws\u2019. Thus, for\nexample, presumably objects are the ontological correlates of the\nmeaning category of nominative expressions, properties are the\nontological correlates of adjectival expressions, and states of\naffairs are the ontological correlates of propositions. So while\nHusserl does not (to my knowledge) explicitly lay out a method of\ndiscerning ontological categories, it may be that we can\nderive them by beginning from the above nonsense test for\ndistinguishing meaning categories, and then shifting attention to the\ncorrelative ontological categories, since \u201cpure truths\nconcerning meaning can be transformed into pure truths concerning the\nobject\u201d (1913 [1962], 61).\n\nAs well as explicitly distinguishing categories of meanings from\ncategories of the correlated objects that could possibly be\n\u2018meant\u2019, Husserl introduced a second innovation to the\nstudy of categories by distinguishing highest formal essences\n(which Husserl calls \u2018categories\u2019) from highest\nmaterial essences (which he calls \u2018regions\u2019)\n(1913 [1962], \u00a710; cf. Smith 1995, 329\u2013330 and Smith 2007,\n142\u2013148). Thus far I have been describing the formal\nontological categories, the correlates of the different meaning\ncategories distinguishable by the nonsense test. In fact, Husserl\nreserves the term \u2018category\u2019 for the highest formal\ngenera, which are distinguished by a process of formalization\n\u2013 a removal of content. These \u2018categorial essences\u2019\nbegin with \u2018object in general\u2019 at the top of the tree,\nwhich is then divided at the next level into categories including (as\nexamples) object, state of affairs, property, relation, number, etc.\n(compare lists 1913 [2000], 237 and 1913 [1962], 61). Much as\nAristotle distinguished (independent) primary substances from\n(dependent) things of other kinds, within his formal categories\nHusserl distinguishes the \u2018substrative\u2019 category of\nindividuals (or, more properly, the mere this-there) from the\ndependent \u2018syntactic objectivities\u2019 \u2013 the correlates\nof nominative terms that are derived from ways in which we speak about\nthe primary substances (1913 [1962], 62\u20133 and 67) (as, e.g., the\nnominative term \u2018this relation of brightness\u2019 may be\nderived from claims that \u2018A is brighter than B\u2019 (1913\n[2000], 797\u20138)).\n\nHusserl\u2019s material categories, by contrast, classify entities\naccording to their nature or essence, with the highest material genera\nto be arrived at by a process of generalization to the most\ngeneral kind of content involved, rather than by the\nformalization that involves an emptying of all content (1913\n[1962], 65). The highest material categories are the three regions:\nnature (including physical objects and events), culture (including\nartifacts, social entities, and values), and consciousness (cf. Smith\n2004). While formal and material category systems each form a\nhierarchy (1913 [1962], 64), considered jointly their categories are\nnot mutually exclusive, since one and the same entity may be\ncategorized either in terms of its material nature or its form. For\nfurther discussion of Husserl\u2019s categories, see Smith (2007,\n135\u2013161).\n\nHusserl is nowhere explicit about the proper method for distinguishing\nmaterial ontological categories, but he does distinguish material\nabsurdity from formal absurdity, and from the formal nonsense that\nmarks the difference in meaning categories (1913 [2000], 523).\nExpressions are formally absurd if it is a priori\nthat no object could correspond to them, based purely on formal,\nlogical laws, without regard to which particular material concepts are\nemployed, e.g., \u201ca round not-round thing\u201d is formally\nabsurd; its absurdity would remain regardless of which adjective we\nsubstituted for \u2018round\u2019 or which noun for\n\u2018thing\u2019. On the other hand, expressions are materially\nabsurd if the impossibility of there being any corresponding object is\nbased in the particular material concepts employed, e.g., \u2018a\nround square\u2019 is a materially absurd expression based in the\nparticular meanings of \u2018round\u2019 and \u2018square\u2019.\nThus presumably one could attempt to distinguish material ontological\ncategories by the material absurdity that results from substituting\nexpressions for objects of different material kinds; \u2018a\nround table\u2019, for example, makes perfect sense, but if we\nsubstitute for \u2018table\u2019 a term for a geometric figure such\nas \u2018square\u2019 or for a day of the week such as\n\u2018Thursday\u2019, we get a materially absurd statement (to which\nit is a priori that nothing corresponds). As we will see in\n\u00a72.2 below, Gilbert Ryle developed Husserl\u2019s nonsense test\nfor category differences in something like this way.\n\nRoman Ingarden (1960 [1964], 22ff) took Husserl\u2019s\nmulti-dimensional ontology one step further. Like Husserl, he\ndistinguished formal categories from material categories, but he also\ndistinguished categories in a third dimension: existential categories\n(those describing an entity\u2019s mode of being). The highest\nexistential categories on Ingarden\u2019s list are the real\n(spatio-temporal being), the ideal (abstract), the absolute\n(completely independent, atemporal), and purely intentional\n(consciousness-dependent). While any conceivable entity should be\nuniquely locatable in a single category of each dimension, the three\nsorts of ontology are mutually orthogonal, providing different most\nabstract ways of considering the putative entity in question. Thus,\ne.g., a sculpture might be categorized formally as an object,\nmaterially as a work of art, and existentially as purely\nintentional.\n1.4 Recent Category Systems\n\nIn the twentieth century, systems of ontological categories fell\nsomewhat out of fashion (for reasons I will discuss in \u00a71.5\nbelow), with most discussion of categories shifting to merely\narticulating category differences rather than aiming to\noutline a comprehensive system of categories.\n\nOne important exception to this comes in the work of Samuel Alexander,\nwho, in his 1920 work Space, Time and Deity develops a theory\nof categories in the realist spirit. Alexander defends a monist\nontology in which he posits Space-Time as \u201cthe one monistic\nentity that encompasses every entity and every feature in\nreality\u201d (Fisher 2015, 246). He sees the categories as grounded\non the intrinsic nature of Space-Time, and posits as categorial\nfeatures only those which are \u2018pervasive\u2019, that is,\ninstantiated by every entity. The categories he identifies come in\nthree \u2018grades\u2019 (or ranks of increasing complexity, in\nwhich the latter grades presuppose the former), giving us the\nfollowing system:\n\nGrade 1\n\n\nExistence\nUniversality\nRelation\nOrder\n \nGrade 2\n\n\nSubstance\nCausality\nQuantity\nNumber\n \nGrade 3\n\n\nMotion\n \n\n\nIn recent years there have also been several notable attempts to offer\nnew systems of categories in either the realist or descriptivist\nspirit, although little agreement exists about what the categories are\nor how one could decide among competing systems.\n\nIngvar Johansson (1989) and Roderick Chisholm (1996) both take a\nneo-Aristotelian realist approach to categories, attempting to lay out\na complete system of the categories, where this is understood as\nproviding a list of categories of real entities in the world. Ingvar\nJohansson explicitly insists that his interest is in the world:\n\u201cThis book is a book about the world. I am concerned with\nontology, not merely with language\u201d (1989, 1), and attempts to\noffer \u201ca realist theory of categories regarded as real aspects\nof being\u201d (1989, 2). His list (1989, 20) includes nine main\ncategories (some of which subdivide further):\n\nSpace-time\nState of affairs\nQuality\n\n\nSubstance\nProperty\n \nExternal Relation\nGrounded Relation\nInertia\nSpontaneity\nTendency\nIntentionality\n\n\nReal\n\n\nPresentational\nRepresentational\n \nFictional\n \n\n\nUnlike Aristotle, Johansson makes no explicit use of language in\ndiscerning ontological categories, instead appealing to the method of\nsuccessive abstraction (Johansson 1989, 1\u20132). Thus, e.g., we\narrive at the category \u2018quality\u2019 by moving up in\nabstraction from a particular shade of dark red, to red, color, and\nfinally quality. Similarly (to use an example of Sellars\u2019) one\nmight try to arrive at the category of \u2018substance\u2019 by\nconsidering an individual entity, say, Fido, and moving by successive\nabstraction from \u201cFido is a dachshund\u201d through \u201cFido\nis a dog\u201d and \u201cFido is an animal\u201d, ultimately\nreaching \u201cFido is a substance\u201d (1970 [1974], 321). Like\nAristotle\u2019s categories, Johansson\u2019s categories top out\nwith a number of distinctions without a highest single category\nsubsuming them all.\n\nLike Aristotle and Johansson, Roderick Chisholm presents his work on\ncategories as being \u201cabout the ultimate categories of\nreality\u201d (1996, 3). Unlike them, however, Chisholm (1996, 3)\nlays out categories in the form of a Porphyrian tree starting from a\nsingle most general category comprising everything, but divided into\nsuccessively narrower genera at lower levels of branching. (For an\ninteresting discussion of whether such general terms as\n\u2018entity\u2019 or \u2018thing\u2019 could be seen as naming a\nhighest category, see Thompson 1957, cf. \u00a72.3 below).\nChisholm\u2019s system of categories thus reads:\n\nEntia\n\n\nContingent\n\n\nStates\n\n\nEvents\n \nIndividuals\n\n\nBoundaries\nSubstances\n \n \nNecessary\n\n\nStates\nNonstates\n\n\nAttributes\nSubstance\n \n \n \n\n\nOther contemporary authors have approached the issue of categories in\na purely descriptive spirit. Reinhardt Grossmann, for example,\ndistinguishes eight highest categories (1983, xvi):\n\nIndividuals\nProperties\nRelations\nClasses\nStructures\nQuantifiers\nFacts\nNegation\n\n\nBut although Grossmann characterizes his book as an attempt to\n\u201cbring Aristotle\u2019s Categories up-to-date\u201d\n(1983, xv), he is explicit in denying that he is making any claims\nabout whether or not there are things belonging to any of the eight\ncategories he distinguishes, taking this as beyond the scope of\nontology (1983, 10\u201312).\n\nJoshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz (1994) lay out a tree-form system\nof categories, with entity the summum genus,\nsubdivided into abstract and concrete (rather than\nChisholm\u2019s contingent and necessary), each of\nwhich is further subdivided:\n\nEntity\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nProperty\nRelation\nProposition\n \nConcrete\n\n\nEvent\nTime\nPlace\nSubstance\n\n\nMaterial Object\nSpirit\n \nLimit\nCollection\nPrivation\nTrope\n \n \n\n\nThey, too, explicitly offer their system of categories in the spirit\nof categorial description, as offering an analysis of the various\npossible categories of being, rather than making any claims about\nwhich of these categories is non-empty (1994, 7\u20138).\n\nE. J. Lowe takes categories to be categories of \u201cwhat kinds of\nthings can exist and coexist\u201d (2006, 5). Such categories, he\nargues, are to be individuated according to the existence and/or\nidentity conditions of their members; fundamental categories are those\nregarding which the existence and identity conditions for their\nmembers cannot be exhaustively specified in terms of ontological\ndependence relations they bear to entities of other categories (2006,\n8). Accordingly, he argues that there are four fundamental ontological\ncategories: objects (individual substances such as Fido), modes\n(property or relation instances such as Fido\u2019s four-leggedness),\nkinds (substantial universals such as the kind dog), and\nattributes (property or relation universals, such as being\nfour-legged). But although he argues that there are exactly four\nfundamental categories, Lowe nonetheless takes a hierarchical\napproach to arranging categories. The four fundamental categories\nappear at the third level of his hierarchical chart; the categories\nthat appear at the higher levels (particulars and universals at the\nsecond level; entity at the top) are \u201cmere abstractions and do\nno serious ontological work on their own account\u201d (2006, 39).\nHis fuller chart of categories appears as follows:\n\nEntities\n\n\nParticulars\n\n\nObjects\n\n\nSubstances\nNon-substances\n \nModes (monadic and relational)\n \nUniversals\n\n\nKinds\nAttributes (properties and relations)\n \n \n\n\nOthers, taking the project of developing categories in an explicitly\nrealist spirit and driven by the goal of offering a parsimonious\nontology, have aimed to offer a more minimal system of fundamental\nontological categories. For example, Laurie Paul (2016) has recently\ndefended a \u2018one-category\u2019 ontology that accepts (at the\nfundamental level) only the existence of intrinsic characters or\nqualities. Against those who accept more categories, she argues that\nwe have no need (for example) for a fundamental division between\nindividuals and their properties, and that a one-category ontology is\nboth more parsimonious and has a better claim to carve the world at\nits \u2018ontological joints\u2019.\n1.5 Skepticism about Category Systems\n\nBoth realist and descriptivist category systems, at least as\ntraditionally presented, seem to presuppose that there is a unique\ntrue answer to the question of what categories of entity there are\n\u2013 indeed the discovery of this answer is the goal of most such\ninquiries into ontological categories. Grossman, for example, argues\nthat a list of categories must be complete, contain everything, with\neverything in its proper place (1983, 4). Johansson similarly\ntakes his project as to \u201cdevelop a coherent system of\nall the most abstract categories needed to give a true\ndescription of the world\u201d (1989, 1). Arguments about which of\nthe many systems of categories offered is correct likewise seem to\npresuppose that there is a uniquely correct list of categories.\n\nBut actual category systems offered vary so much that even a short\nsurvey of past category systems like that above can undermine the\nbelief that such a unique, true and complete system of categories may\nbe found. Given such a diversity of answers to the question of what\nthe ontological categories are, by what criteria could we possibly\nchoose among them to determine which is uniquely correct?\n\nSome minimal standards of adequacy immediately suggest themselves\n(Butchvarov 1995, 75). Whether one takes a realist or descriptivist\napproach to providing a system of categories, if that system is\nsupposed to be comprehensive, it clearly must meet at least the\nstandard of being exhaustive \u2013 providing a category for\neverything there is (on the realist approach) or might be (on the\ndescriptive approach). Nonetheless, one may, as Hoffman and\nRosenkrantz (1994, 140) do, present a system of some\nfundamental categories without taking it to be exhaustive.\n\nAnother minimal criterion of adequacy is generally taken to be that\nthe highest categories (or, for tree systems, the categories at each\nlevel of branching) be mutually exclusive, ensuring that whatever\nthere is (or might be) finds its place in exactly one highest\ncategory, or one category at each level (Chisholm 1989, 162). (This\nstill allows for nested categories, so that something may belong to\nboth a more specific category like substance and a more general\ncategory like individual.)\n\nBut these criteria are not enough to provide the needed reassurance.\nFirst, we lack assurance that most proposed category systems meet even\nthese minimal conditions. As mentioned above, Aristotle drew out his\ncategories largely by considering the types of question that could be\nasked (and the types of answer appropriate to them). It is difficult\nto know, however, how one can be assured that all kinds of questions\nhave been surveyed, and so difficult to know that an exhaustive list\nof categories has been offered \u2013 a point Aristotle does not\nattempt to demonstrate (Ackrill 1963, 80\u201381). Indeed, the fact\nthat Aristotle provides different lists of categories in different\nplaces suggests that he did not consider his list final and\nexhaustive. Similarly, Kant\u2019s system of categories can be\nthought to be exhaustive only as long as the list of forms of judgment\nfrom which he derives them exhausts the possible forms of judgment\n\u2013 but we have reason to think this is not so (K\u00f6rner 1955,\n50). Johansson, as we have seen, instead uses the method of successive\nabstraction. But it is not clear how following such a method could\nensure either that the categories thereby distinguished are exhaustive\n(how do we know we have considered something of each highest kind if\nwe do not yet know what the highest kinds are?) or even mutually\nexclusive.\n\nSecondly, even if we can verify that the standards of mutual\nexclusivity and exhaustiveness are met, these conditions alone are far\ntoo weak to uniquely pick out a system of categories. Provided one\naccepts the law of the excluded middle, an endless supply of mutually\nexclusive and exhaustive classifications can be generated at will: we\ncan divide things into the spatio-temporally located and the\nnot-spatio-temporally-located, the intentional and the\nnon-intentional, the extended and the non-extended, to name but a few\nof the more relevant ways in which things could be divided. Indeed one\nof the sources of puzzlement about categories comes from the fact that\nphilosophers have selected so many different sorts of divide as\nthe fundamental category difference \u2013 for Descartes,\nthe extended and the thinking (unextended), for Chisholm the\ncontingent and the necessary, for Hoffman and Rosenkrantz the concrete\nand the abstract, and so on. Thus another reason for skepticism about\nthe existence of a unique set of categories comes from the\nfact that categories are supposed to be the most abstract genera under\nwhich things (may) fall. But from any given entity, abstraction may\napparently be done in a variety of ways \u2013 even if we are careful\nto do so in ways that ensure mutual exclusivity and\nexhaustiveness.\n\nDoubts about possibilities for discovering the one true category\nsystem have led many to eschew talk of category systems altogether,\nand others to adopt some kind of relativism about category systems\nthat ceases to take systems of categories seriously as candidate lists\nof the single set of highest genera under which anything\nfalls (or could fall). Jan Westerhoff (2005), for example, argues that\nthere is no unique, absolute set of ontological categories. On his\nview categories in metaphysics turn out to be analogous to axioms in\nmathematical theories; in each case, there may be more than one way to\nsystematize our knowledge from a relatively simple basis. The result\nis a kind of relativity about systems of categories: \u201cwhich set\nof ontological categories we choose is primarily a matter of\nconvenience, in the same way as specific axiomatizations of\npropositional logic or Newtonian mechanics are more convenient to use\nthan others\u201d (2005, 218). As a result, Westerhoff argues, we\nmust reassess the importance of ontological categories in metaphysics\n\u2013 these should not be considered \u201cthe most fundamental\nparts of the world, but... the most fundamental parts of our\nsystematization of the world\u201d (2005, 135).\n\nOthers have taken the variety of category systems explicitly offered\nor presupposed by philosophers as mere evidence of the particular\npresuppositions of their thought, or prejudices of their age \u2013\nnot as evidence about anything to do with the world and its divisions.\nThus, e.g., Stephan K\u00f6rner\u2019s discussion of categorial\nframeworks is designed to make explicit how a thinker\u2019s\nframework categorizes objects, making use of certain individuative\nprinciples, and making clear his reasons for holding that framework\n(1970, 10). R. G. Collingwood, in similar vein, treats the task of\nmetaphysics generally as merely uncovering the \u201cpresuppositions\nunderlying ordinary science\u201d (1940 [1998]).\n\nThe specific worries about (1) guaranteeing the mutual exclusiveness\nand joint exhaustiveness of the categories, and (2) whether or not any\nsingle system of categories could purport to be uniquely correct, can,\nhowever, be met by certain ways of formulating ontological categories.\nThe first sort of worry can be met by ensuring that categories (of the\nsame level) are defined in ways that guarantee mutual exclusiveness\nand exhaustiveness. Thus, e.g., Thomasson (1999, chapter 8)\ndistinguishes categories in terms of what relations of dependence a\npurported entity has or lacks on mental states (and a second\ndimension is distinguished in terms of what relations of dependence a\npurported entity has or lacks on spatio-temporally located objects),\nso that the law of the excluded middle alone ensures mutual\nexclusiveness and exhaustiveness of the categories distinguished.\n(Dummett\u2019s method of distinguishing categories provides another\nroute for guaranteeing mutual exclusivity \u2013 see \u00a72.3\nbelow).\n\nMulti-dimensional systems (Husserl 1913 [1962], \u00a710; Ingarden\n1960 [1964], Chapter 2; Thomasson 1999, Chapter 8; Smith 2007, Chapter\n8) address the second worry to some extent by acknowledging that the\ndifferent dimensions of categorization are possible, and that no\none-dimensional list can purport to completeness. In principle,\nmulti-dimensionalists may even accept that there is no fixed number or\nlimit on how many one-dimensional lists of categories there may be,\nthough each such list may purport to provide a unique, correct,\nexhaustive categorization of entities considered in the chosen\nrespect.\n\nIn any case, given the great potential uses of a system of categories\n(many of which do not depend on claims that that category system is\nuniquely \u2018correct\u2019), we should not prematurely abandon\nattempts at developing and evaluating systems of categorization. Even\nif we do not think of a category system as providing a realist\ninventory of all that exists or a description of the fundamental\nintrinsic \u2018divisions of reality\u2019, a system of categories\nlaid out in the descriptivist spirit provides a framework within which\nexistence questions can be answered in a systematic and wholesale way,\nby enumerating categories so that we can then undertake further\ninvestigations into whether or not there really is anything of each\nkind. Working from within a categorial framework can help ensure that\nwhatever ontology we provide is principled and unified, avoiding\nad hoc and piecemeal decisions. The descriptivist\u2019s\ncategories also provide a tool that may be used elsewhere in ontology,\ne.g., in helping to ensure that comparisons of parsimony are\nlegitimately made (by examining which categories of entity are\naccepted and which denied by various theories), and in checking that\npotential solutions to metaphysical problems are not overlooked by\ntacit use of a category system that is not exhaustive (Thomasson 1999,\nChapters 8 and 9). Another important use of systems of categories is\nthat, with a proposed set of categories laid out, we can, as Daniel\nNolan (2011) suggests, go on to investigate questions about the\nrelationships among entities that are placed in different categories:\nfor example, questions about whether events depend on or are grounded\nin things, or (as Nolan suggests) whether things and events may\nultimately be identified as belonging to a single category.\nAssumptions about categorizations play such a strong role in\nphilosophical discussions (e.g., discussions of the Cartesian theory\nof mind, Platonist theories of mathematics, etc.), that doing the work\non categories necessary to make these categorial assumptions explicit\nand open them for examination must remain a highly useful exercise\nregardless of doubts about the prospects for discovering a uniquely\ncorrect system of categories.\n1.6 Categories in Other Disciplines\n\nFor those who approach categories in a descriptive spirit, as a matter\nof determining the categories of our language or thought, it is\nnatural to turn to linguistics or cognitive science for\nassistance.\n\nA prominent approach to determining the ontological categories that\nare implicit in the use of natural language is via Natural Language\nOntology, which provides one way of undertaking a descriptivist\napproach to categories. As Friederike Moltmann (2017) makes clear,\nhowever, the methodology for doing natural language ontology is\nimportantly different from attempts to determine a common sense\nontology by simply asking what ontological claims or categories people\nexplicitly accept or would accept on reflection. So, for example,\nNatural Language Ontology doesn\u2019t determine the ontological\ncategories of a natural language by looking to explicit assertions\nspeakers make (or would assent to) about categories, such as\n\u201cobjects are not events\u201d. Instead, natural language\ncategory distinctions are revealed by uncovering the\npresuppositions of sentences used by ordinary speakers. For\nexample, the fact that one can acceptably say \u201cThe building\nexisted last year\u201d but not \u201cThe building took place last\nyear\u201d, and \u201cJohn\u2019s arrival took place last\nweek\u201d but not \u201cJohn\u2019s arrival existed last\nweek\u201d, it has been argued, presupposes a difference of category\nbetween material objects and events, since the conditions of\napplicability for these predicates apparently presuppose that they\napply to entities of different categories (Moltmann 2017, Section\n3.1). Since Natural Language Ontology \u201cconcerns itself with the\nontological categories and structures a speaker accepts when using a\nlanguage, not those a speaker accepts when engaging in some form of\nphilosophical reflection\u201d, its results may differ widely from\nthe ontological categories many philosophers would reflectively\naccept, and even from those commonly attributed to natural language\n(Moltmann 2017, Section 1). We have reason to engage in natural\nlanguage ontology, Moltmann argues, since it may give us \u201cthe\nbest indication of how we, implicitly, conceive of things\u201d\n(2017, Section 7). A question that remains is whether there will be a\nuniform ontology found across all natural languages, perhaps one fixed\nby our cognitive structure.\n\nOne might, of course, turn to cognitive science to attempt to address\nthe question of whether there is a fixed system of categories\ndetermined by our cognitive structure. And indeed, discussions of\ncategories also play an important role in cognitive science, where the\ngoal is not to discover the fundamental categories of being, but\nrather the means by which experiencers come to categorize their world.\nHere, debates have centered on how humans in fact come to group things\ninto categories \u2013 whether this involves lists of definitional\n(observable or hidden) features, resemblance to prototypes, prominent\nfeatures weighted probabilistically, etc. Debates also concern the\nrelation between conceptual and linguistic categories, which levels of\ncategory are more basic, whether there is a most basic set of\ncategories, whether or to what extent categorizations are consistent\nacross cultural groups, and whether or not some fundamental categories\nare innate. The psychologist Susan Carey (2011) has engaged in a\nnumber of studies on infants and primates which, she argues, suggest\nthat there are a number of concepts of \u2018core cognition\u2019\nthat are innate, designed to represent certain classes of entity in\nthe world, and that are shared across pre-linguistic human infants,\nadults, and other primates. These include the concept of object (taken\nas a sortal concept that makes use of boundedness and spatio-temporal\ncontinuity in individuation), quantity, intentional agency, and\ncausation. For further discussion of the debates about categorization\nin cognitive science see Lakoff (1987) and Rakison and Oakes\n(2003).\n\nRecently, work on ontological categories has attracted interest not\nonly among philosophers, but also in information science and the\nbiomedical sciences, where ontologies are used to organize the\nknowledge represented in information systems (Smith 2003). In some\ncases, the ontologies developed are domain-specific (e.g. specific to\nmedical information, geographic information, etc.), but there has also\nbeen a great deal of interest in developing a \u2018top-level\u2019\nontology of maximally general categories applicable to all specific\ndomains and enabling data sharing across systems. It is such top-level\nontologies that draw upon philosophical work on ontological categories\nmost directly, although categorial distinctions also play a crucial\nrole in domain-specific ontologies. Both sorts of philosophical work\non categorization promise to have a wide variety of practical\napplications to information management that are just beginning to be\nexplored (see Sowa 1995, Munn & Smith (eds.) 2008)\n2. Category Differences\n\nMuch recent work on categories has been influenced by skepticism about\nthe possibility of offering a system of ontological categories.\nDifficulties like those mentioned above have undermined the idea that\na uniquely true and comprehensive system of ontological categories can\nbe found. The skepticism that comes from noting the proliferation of\ncategory systems is compounded by general skepticism about\nmetaphysics. In some cases this has come from imputations of logical\npositivists that all metaphysical talk is nonsense. More recently, the\nskepticism has arisen from general doubts about the epistemology of\nmetaphysics (Bennett 2009, Kriegel 2013, Thomasson 2015), as well as\nmore specific doubts that we can make sense of the idea that the world\nhas a distinctly \u2018ontological structure\u2019, or that we could\ndiscover what that structure is.\n\nAs a result, while categories have continued to play a central role in\nanalytic philosophy in the past century, and while some have continued\nto pursue work on categories in the realist spirit, others have\nshifted their focus to identifying differences in\nsemantic categories rather than drawing out systems\nof ontological categories. Thus when Gilbert Ryle (1949, 1938\n[1971]) talks of categories, he does not speak directly of categories\nof entities, but rather of differing logical types of\nconcepts, where such type differences are detectable by the\nabsurdities that result from substituting in terms of one sort for\nterms of another in sentences of certain kinds (see \u00a72.2 below).\nWilfrid Sellars, developing a strategy of Ockham\u2019s, argues\nexplicitly that we may construe category statements as disguised\nmetalinguistic statements about the conceptual role of certain\nexpressions (and their functional counterparts in other languages).\nAccording to Sellars, \u201cSocrates is a substance\u201d, for\nexample, has the sense of \u201cThe \u00b7Socrates\u00b7 is a\nbasic mental singular term\u201d, and \u201cYellow is a\nquality\u201d has the sense of \u201cThe \u00b7yellow\u00b7 is a\n(one-place) predicate (in mentalese)\u201d (1970 [1974], 328) (where\nthe \u201c\u00b7___\u00b7\u201d notation has the function of\nenabling us to speak about linguistic roles without being tied to a\nparticular natural language). As a result, we can replicate the work\ndone by traditional category distinctions between, e.g., substance and\nquality, without committing ourselves ontologically to the existence\nof qualities or other abstracta (1970 [1974], 329). On Sellars\u2019\nview, the categories are \u201cmetaconceptual, second-order\nfunctional classifications of the most fundamental types of\nfirst-order conceptual roles within a norm-governed linguistic\npractice or conceptual framework\u201d (O\u2019Shea forthcoming,\nsection 1). An interesting upshot of this Sellarsian way of looking at\nthe categories is that are not fixed, but may change over time as the\nconceptual roles in our norm-governed practices change (O\u2019Shea\nforthcoming, section 2).\n2.1 The Uses of Category Distinctions\n\nThose who focus on articulating category distinctions rather than on\nlaying out complete systems of categories generally invoke categories\nnot in hopes of providing answers to such basic metaphysical questions\nas \u2018what exists\u2019, but rather as a way of exposing,\navoiding, or dissolving various presumed philosophical mistakes,\nconfusions, and paradoxes.\n\nThus, e.g., Russell and Whitehead introduced type theory (which might\nin some sense be considered a theory of categories) to avoid a certain\nform of paradox found in Fregean set theory (where we must consider\nthe putative set of all non-self membered sets, which is a member of\nitself if and only if it is not a member of itself), liar\u2019s\nparadoxes (\u201cThis sentence is false\u201d, which is true if and\nonly if it is false), etc. On their analysis, paradoxes like these\narise from the attempt to form an illegitimate totality by trying to\ncollect into a single totality a collection that has members that\npresuppose the existence of the totality. To avoid such paradoxes, we\nmust accept that \u201cWhatever involves all of a collection\nmust not be one of the collection\u201d (1913 [1962], 37) and thus\nthat such totalities (involving all of a collection) must be of a\nhigher type, making, e.g., classes of sets of a higher type than are\nsets of individuals, and so on, leading to an infinite hierarchy of\ntypes. The type-mixing paradox-generating claims are rejected as\nill-formed and meaningless (1913 [1962]).\n\nMost famously, Ryle (1949) introduced the idea of the category mistake\nas a way of dispelling the confusions he thought to be rampant in the\nCartesian theory of the mind, and thus of dissolving many apparent\nproblems in philosophy of mind. According to Ryle, one makes a\ncategory mistake when one mistakes the logical type or category of a\ncertain expression (1949, 16\u201317). Thus, e.g., a foreigner would\nmake a category mistake if he observed the various colleges,\nlibraries, and administrative offices of Oxford, and then asked to be\nshown the university. The foreigner mistakes the university for\nanother institution like those he has seen, when in fact it is\nsomething of another category altogether: \u201cthe way in which all\nthat he has already seen is organized\u201d (1949, 16). The category\nmistake behind the Cartesian theory of mind, on Ryle\u2019s view, is\nbased in representing mental concepts such as believing, knowing,\naspiring, or detesting as acts or processes (and concluding they must\nbe covert, unobservable acts or processes), when the concepts of\nbelieving, knowing, and the like are actually dispositional (1949,\n33). Properly noting category distinctions may help alleviate a\nvariety of philosophical problems and perplexities, and the idea of\nthe category mistake was widely wielded (by Ryle and others) with this\naim. Ofra Magidor suggests that it is \u201cfar from clear what Ryle\ntook the central mistake in the dualistic position to be\u201d (2013,\n10). Jonah Goldwater (forthcoming), however, argues that, in The\nConcept of Mind, the category mistakes Ryle identifies all have\nthe form of mistakenly conjoining entities that belong in two\ndifferent categories \u2013 implicitly assigning their conjuncts to a\nshared category. But on Ryle\u2019s view (Goldwater argues) there is\noften no single highest category (\u2018existent\u2019) under which\nwe can subsume the conjoined entities, and so we cannot sensibly\nconjoin, count, or quantify over them together. This, Goldwater\nargues, not only clarifies the basis for Ryle\u2019s critique of both\nCartesian and physicalist theories of mind, but also has the potential\nto dissolve various current debates in metaphysics, such as arguments\nagainst co-location that are based on denying (for example) that there\nis a statue and a lump both on the pedestal. Huw\nPrice (2009, 330\u2013335) argues that the category differences Ryle\nidentifies can be seen as underlain by functional differences\nin the sorts of language used. The thought that category mistakes are\nsymptoms of underlying functional differences, as Price puts it,\nsuggests that to evaluate claims of category mistakes, and their\nrelevance to traditional \u2018metaphysical\u2019 problems, we need\n\u201cfirst-order scientific inquiries into the underlying functions\nof language in human life\u201d (Price 2009, 335). Thomasson (2022,\n23\u201329) picks up this idea, and begins to suggest how work in\nsystemic functional linguistics can provide a way of understanding\ndifferences in linguistic function that may underlie a range of\nphilosophical problems.\n\nWork on category distinctions also has other applications in assessing\ntraditional debates in metaphysics. Thomasson (2007) argues that\nvarious mistakes and puzzlements in ontology can be traced to the\nmistaken use of category-neutral existential and quantificational\nclaims. A great many arguments in ontology rely on claims about\nwhether, in various situations, there is some object present\n(or how many objects there are), where the term \u2018object\u2019\nmust be used in a category-neutral way for the argument to go through\n(Thomasson 2007, 112\u2013118). But if existential and\nquantificational claims must tacitly presuppose some category or\ncategories of entity over which we are quantifying, then such\narguments go astray. Thomasson (2007) gives independent grounds for\nthinking that all quantification must at least tacitly presuppose a\ncategory or categories of entity over which we are quantifying, and\nargues that adopting that view provides the uniform basis for\ndissolving a number of problems supposed to arise with accepting an\nontology of ordinary objects. Jonah Goldwater (2021) argues that the\narguments standardly given for being eliminativist about a certain\nkind of entity all rely on mistaken principles or judgments about\nontological categories, to which the right response is typically to\nrectify these mistakes about categories, not to eliminate the\nentities. This analysis, Goldwater argues, provides a kind of indirect\nsupport for \u2018permissivist\u2019 ontologies, that would accept\nthe existence of numbers, properties, holes, or other entities to\nwhich metaphysicians have often sought to avoid commitment.\n\nWork on category distinctions is also relevant to debates in\nlinguistics and philosophy of language about what, exactly, a category\nmistake is, and why category mistakes are infelicitous. Analyzing\ncategory mistakes and why they are infelicitous (as Magidor 2019 makes\nclear) has further relevance for linguistic theories of syntax,\nsemantics, pragmatics, and of metaphorical and fictional discourse.\nMagidor (2013, 2019) surveys past answers to the question of what\nmakes a category mistake infelicitous, including: that they are\nsyntactically ill-formed, that they are meaningless, that they are\nmeaningful but lacking in truth-value, and that they are (despite\nbeing well formed, meaningful and having truth-value) pragmatically\ninappropriate. Magidor argues against the first three options, and\ndefends instead a presuppositional account of why sentences that seem\nto contain category mistakes are infelicitous. Roughly, on her view, a\nsentence like \u2018Two is green\u2019 triggers the presupposition\nthat two is colored \u2013 a presupposition that is difficult to\naccommodate (2013, 132). Thus, on her analysis, the sentence is\ninfelicitous, but still has a truth-value (it is false).\n2.2 The Ryle/Husserl Method of Distinguishing Categories\n\nWhile those who only make use of the idea of category differences\n(rather than purporting to offer a category system) have no need to\nworry about how to provide an exhaustive list of categories, they\nnonetheless owe an account of the conditions under which we can\nlegitimately claim that two entities, concepts, or terms are of\ndifferent categories, so that we know when a category mistake is (and\nis not) being made. Otherwise, they would face the charge of\narbitrariness or ad hocery in views about which categories\nthere are or where category differences lie. Yet there is little more\nagreement about the proper criteria for distinguishing categories than\nthere is about what categories there are.\n\nRyle famously considered absurdities to be the key to detecting\ncategory differences. But although Ryle made the method famous, he\napparently derived the idea from Husserl\u2019s method of\ndistinguishing categories of meaning (cf. Ryle 1970, 8; Simons 1995,\n120; Thomasson 2002, 124\u20138, and \u00a71.3 above). But while\nHusserl used syntactic nonsense as a way of detecting\ndifferences in categories of meaning (yielding different\ngrammatical categories), Ryle broadened the idea, taking\nabsurdities more widely conceived to be symptoms of\ndifferences in logical or conceptual categories\n(1938 [1971], 180). Thus, e.g., the statement \u201cShe came home in\na flood of tears and a sedan-chair\u201d (Ryle 1949, 22) is perfectly\nwell-formed syntactically, but nonetheless Ryle classifies it as a\nsentence that is absurd, where the absurdity is a symptom of the fact\nthat the sentence conjoins terms of different categories.\n\nIn his earlier paper \u201cCategories\u201d, Ryle describes the test\nfor category differences as follows: \u201cTwo proposition-factors\nare of different categories or types, if there are sentence-frames\nsuch that when the expressions for those factors are imported as\nalternative complements to the same gap-signs, the resultant sentences\nare significant in the one case and absurd in the other\u201d (1938\n[1971], 181) \u2013 in other words, two expressions (or rather: what\nthey signify) differ in category if there are contexts in which\nsubstituting one expression for the other results in absurdity. This\ntest, of course, provides no way of establishing that two expressions\nare of the same category (but only that they are not), since\nthere is an infinite number of sentence-frames, and one may always yet\nbe found that does not permit the substitution to be made without\nabsurdity. It also leaves open and merely intuitive the notion of\n\u2018absurdity\u2019 itself; in fact, Ryle concludes his paper\n\u201cCategories\u201d with the question \u201cBut what are the\ntests of absurdity?\u201d (1938 [1971], 184). Ryle\u2019s approach\nwas further developed, in a more formal fashion, by Fred Sommers\n(1959, 1971).\n\nJ. J. C. Smart (1953) criticized Ryle\u2019s criterion for drawing\ncategory distinctions on grounds that it could apparently be used to\nestablish a category difference between any two expressions\nwhatsoever. \u201cThus \u2018the seat of the \u2013 is hard\u2019\nworks if \u2018chair\u2019 or \u2018bench\u2019 is put into the\nblank, but not if \u2018table\u2019 or \u2018bed\u2019 is. And if\nfurniture words do not form a category, we may well ask what do\u201d\n(1953, 227). Without a test for absurdity apart from a certain kind of\nintuitive unacceptability to native speakers, we seem to be left\nwithout a means of declaring \u2018Saturday is in bed\u2019 to be a\ncategory violation but \u2018The seat of the bed is hard\u2019 not\nto be. Bernard Harrison attempts to meet this challenge by\ndistinguishing the sorts of inappropriateness that result from\nviolations of category facts (such as the former) from those that\nresult from mere violations of facts of usage (the latter) (1965,\n315\u201316). The use of the term \u2018bed\u2019 could conceivably\nbe extended in ways that would make \u2018The seat of the bed is\nhard\u2019 acceptable (e.g., if beds came to be made with seats),\nwhereas \u2018Saturday\u2019 could not conceivably be extended in a\nway that would make \u2018Saturday is in bed\u2019 acceptable\n\u2013 any such attempted \u2018extension\u2019 would just involve\nusing \u2018Saturday\u2019 homonymously (e.g., as the name for a day\nof the week and for a person) (1965, 316\u201318). For further\ndiscussion of intersubstitutability approaches to drawing category\ndistinctions, see Westerhoff (2005, 40\u201359 and 2002,\n338\u2013339). Westerhoff (2004) develops a method of distinguishing\ncategories based on substitutability in worldly states of affairs\nrather than language.\n2.3 Fregean Approaches to Distinguishing Categories\n\nFrege treats distinctions in categories as correlates of distinctions\nin types of linguistic expression. The category of object,\nfor example, is distinguished by reference to the linguistic category\nof proper name (Dummett 1973 [1981], 55\u201356; cf. Wright\n1983, 13 and Hale 1987, 3\u20134) \u2013 i.e., an object just is the\ncorrelate of a proper name, where proper names are held to include all\nsingular terms (including singular substantival phrases preceded by\nthe definite article). Broadly Fregean approaches have been more\nrecently developed and defended by Michael Dummett (1973 [1981]) and\nBob Hale (2010).\n\nHale develops and defends the Fregean idea that \u201cthe division of\nnon-linguistic entities into different types or categories [is]\ndependent upon a prior categorization of the types of expressions by\nmeans of which we refer to them\u201d (2010, 403). As he develops the\nidea, to be an object is \u201cto be the referent of a\npossible singular term, to be a property is to be the\nreferent of a possible (first-level) predicate, and so on for\nother cases\u201d (2010, 411). He also argues that this encourages a\ndeflationary approach to existence questions according to which we may\nargue for the existence of entities of a certain kind by simply\narguing \u201cthat there are true statements involving expressions of\nthe relevant kind\u201d (2010, 406).\n\nDummett (1973 [1981]) also aims to develop and precisify a broadly\nFregean approach to category distinctions. Frege leaves the\ndistinction between so-called \u2018proper names\u2019 and other\nparts of speech merely intuitively understood, but Dummett argues\nthat, e.g., one could make a start at criteria for distinguishing\nproper names by requiring substitutability of terms while preserving\nthe well-formedness of a sentence (which, as we have seen in\n\u00a71.3, also plays a role in Husserl\u2019s distinction of meaning\ncategories), and while preserving the validity of various patterns of\ninference (where the latter requirement is needed to distinguish\nproper names from other substantival terms such as\n\u2018someone\u2019 and \u2018nobody\u2019) (1973 [1981], 58 ff.).\n(For further refinements of these criteria, see Dummett (1973 [1981],\n61\u201373) and Hale (1987, Chapter 2).)\n\nIn line with Frege\u2019s requirement (1884 [1968], \u00a762) that\nnames must be associated with a criterion of identity, Dummett argues\nthat an additional test (beyond these formal tests) is needed to\ndistinguish genuine proper names (to which objects correspond) from\nother sorts of expression: \u201cEven though an expression passes the\nmore formal tests we devised, it is not to be classified as a proper\nname, or thought of as standing for an object, unless we can speak of\na criterion of identity, determined by the sense of the expression,\nwhich applies to the object for which it stands\u201d (1973 [1981],\n79).\n\nThus once grammatical categories are distinguished, enabling us to\nthereby distinguish the logical category object by reference\nto the linguistic category of proper name, we can go on to\ndraw out category distinctions among objects. To avoid confusion,\nDummett calls the first range of distinctions (among logical\ncategories of objects, properties, relations, etc.) distinctions among\n\u2018types\u2019 and the second range of distinctions (within the\ntype object) distinctions among \u2018categories\u2019\n(1973 [1981], 76).\n\nSince, as Dummett argues (in a point further developed in Lowe 1989\nand Wiggins 2001), proper names and sortal terms must be associated\nwith a criterion of identity that determines the conditions under\nwhich the term may be correctly applied again to one and the same\nthing (1973 [1981], 73\u201375), we may use the associated criteria\nof identity in order to distinguish categories of objects referred to.\nAll of those names and general sortal terms (usable in forming complex\nnames) that share a criterion of identity are said to be terms of the\nsame category, even if the criteria of application for the\nassociated sortals vary (1973 [1981], 546). Thus, e.g., the sortal\nterms \u2018horse\u2019 and \u2018cow\u2019 (similarly, names of\nhorses and cows) are terms of the same category, since they share the\nidentity criteria suitable for animals.\n\nAs Lowe (1989, 108\u2013118) notes, this approach to categories\nblocks certain reductivist moves in metaphysics. For, e.g., if sortal\nterms such as \u2018person\u2019 and \u2018organism\u2019 are\nassociated with different identity conditions, then those who seek to\nreductively identify persons with biological organisms are involved in\na category mistake.\n\nThe idea that category distinctions among objects may be drawn out in\nterms of the identity and/or existence conditions associated with\nterms of each category has recently gained popularity. Though they\ndiffer in details, versions of the approach have been utilized not\nonly by Frege, Dummett and Hale but also by Lowe (2006, 6) and\nThomasson (2007).\n\nThis approach to drawing category distinctions among objects can avoid\nvarious potential problems and sources of skepticism. It is not\nsubject to problems like those Smart raised for Ryle\u2019s\ncriterion, for days of the week clearly have different identity\nconditions than do persons, whereas beds and chairs seem to share\nidentity conditions (those suitable for artifacts). Such a method of\ndrawing out categories also is not subject to the sorts of skepticism\nraised above for category systems. Here there is no claim to provide\nan exhaustive list of categories, and for a principled reason:\ndifferent categories may come into discussion as long as nominative\nterms or concepts associated with distinct identity conditions may be\ninvented.\n\nFollowing this method also guarantees that the categories\ndistinguished are mutually exclusive, for it is a corollary of this\nposition that entities may be identified only if they are governed by\nthe same identity conditions (and meet those), so that it is ruled out\na priori that one and the same entity could belong to two or\nmore distinct categories, in violation of the mutual exclusivity\nrequirement.\n\nThis method of distinguishing categories also provides a principled\nway of answering some of the central questions for theories of\ncategories, including whether or not there is a single summum\ngenus, and what the relationship is between linguistic/conceptual\nand ontological categories. Such completely general terms as\n\u201cthing\u201d \u201centity\u201d or \u201cobject\u201d, on\nDummett\u2019s view, are not genuine sortal terms, since they fail to\nprovide any criteria of identity. Thus clearly on this view (as on\nAristotle\u2019s) there is no summum genus under which\ncategories such as artifact, animal, etc. could be\narranged as species, since (lacking criteria of identity) such\ncandidate catch-all terms as \u2018object\u2019,\n\u2018being\u2019, \u2018entity\u2019 and the like are not even\nsortal terms and so cannot be categorial terms.\n\nViews that, like the Rylean and Fregean approaches, distinguish\ncategories by way of language, are sometimes criticized as capable\nonly of noting differences in category of certain linguistic\nexpressions. For why, it might be asked, should that have anything to\ntell us about differences in the categories of real\nthings?\n\nHale argues that there is no serious alternative to using types of\nexpression that aim at referring to entities of different types if we\nhope to characterize such basic logical categories (or types) as\nobject and property (2010, 408). For what it is to be an object or\nproperty evidently cannot be conveyed merely by ostension, nor by more\nsubstantive criteria, without being restrictive in ways that beg the\nquestion against various views of what objects or properties there\nare. Moreover, he argues that we can avoid making our (logical)\ncategories unduly dependent on what language we actually have by\ntreating objects and properties as correlates of possible,\nnot merely actual, expressions of the relevant sorts (2010, 411).\n\nDummett\u2019s way of understanding categories of objects also opens\nthe way for a reply to this objection. For Dummett argues that,\nwithout some associated categorial concept, we cannot single out\nobjects (even using names or demonstratives) (1973 [1981], 571).\nCategorial concepts are necessary for us to single out\n\u2018things\u2019 at all, and cannot be derived from considering\n\u2018things\u2019 preidentified without regard to categories. (It\nwould thus follow from this that Johansson\u2019s idea that we could\narrive at categories by abstraction from considering individual\nthings would be wrong-headed.) On this view, then, categories\nnot only may but must be distinguished primarily by\nway of distinguishing the identity conditions criterially associated\nwith the proper use of different sortal terms and names. If we cannot\nrefer to, discover, or single out objects at all except by way of a\ncertain categorial conception (providing application and identity\nconditions), then the categorial differences in our sortal terms or\nnames (marked by their differences in identity conditions) are\nipso facto, and automatically, category differences in the\nthings singled out by these terms \u2013 the possibility of a\n\u2018mistake\u2019 here just does not arise, and the connection\nbetween the category of an expression used to refer to a given entity\nand the category of the entity referred to is ensured.\n",
