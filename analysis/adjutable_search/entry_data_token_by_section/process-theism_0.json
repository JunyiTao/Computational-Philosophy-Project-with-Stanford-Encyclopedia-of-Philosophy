Historical Notes on Process Theism\n\nAlthough Whitehead was Hartshorne\u2019s senior by thirty-six years,\nthe two men began seriously to develop their ideas about God in\nwritten form at roughly the same time. In his Harvard doctoral\ndissertation (1923), Hartshorne argues for the existence of a God that\nis the eminent exemplification of relational and social values.\nWhitehead\u2019s writings on the concept of God appear only after\n1924, when he moved to America. Between the publication of Science\nand the Modern World (1925) and Process and Reality\n(1929)\u2014a time of intense creativity for Whitehead\u2014he\narticulated his metaphysical system, including the concept of God.\nDuring Whitehead\u2019s first year at Harvard, Hartshorne was in\nEurope for his second year as a Sheldon Traveling Fellow. When he\nreturned to Harvard in 1925 he was given the dual assignment of\nediting the papers of Charles Sanders Peirce and of serving as\nWhitehead\u2019s assistant. After 1940 Hartshorne became the primary\nconduit for Whitehead\u2019s theistic ideas. Indeed, the elaboration\nand defense of process theism fell largely to Hartshorne and his\nstudents at the University of Chicago (1928\u20131955), Emory\nUniversity (1955\u20131962), and the University of Texas at Austin\n(1962\u20132000). So great was Hartshorne\u2019s influence that some\nscholars try to rescue Whitehead from a too Hartshornean\ninterpretation. This fact should serve as a warning that\nHartshorne\u2019s version of process theism is not the same as\nWhitehead\u2019s. We shall see that Hartshorne\u2019s treatment of\ntheism owes much to Whitehead\u2019s metaphysics while departing from\nit in ways that the Englishman would not accept.\n\nHartshorne accepted the task of chronicling process theism\u2019s\nhistory and showing its importance as a significant alternative to\nclassical theism, pantheism, atheism, and other lesser known options\nin philosophical theology. His 1953 anthology (republished in 2000),\nPhilosophers Speak of God, edited with the help of his\nstudent William L. Reese, is a massive critical study of the varieties\nof concepts of God as they relate to process theism. The book includes\nselections from and commentaries on a wide range of thinkers from\nWestern and Eastern traditions, both well-known and obscure. It is\nsafe to say that Hartshorne\u2019s vigorous efforts on behalf of\nprocess theism are the single most important factor in eroding the\nconsensus among philosophers that an eternal, immutable, and\nimpassible deity should be considered normative for philosophical\ntheology. More recently, Daniel Dombrowski has examined the history of\nthe concept of God through the lens of process philosophy (Dombrowski\n2016).\n\nPhilosophers Speak of God demonstrates that Whitehead and\nHartshorne are not the sole representatives of process theism,\nalthough they are its chief exponents. Buddhism, with its twin\nemphases on impermanence and dependent origination, is arguably the\nmost sophisticated ancient form of process philosophy. Buddhist\nphilosophers criticized the notion of a timeless absolute without,\nhowever, developing a form of process theism (e.g. Arnold 1998).\nWhitehead remarks that his concept of God has more richness than the\nBuddhist concept of nirvana and that his philosophy of religion could\nbe viewed as an effort to \u201ctrue up\u201d the Buddhist idea\n(Johnson 1983, 8). Hartshorne maintains that aspects of process theism\nare in Plato\u2019s later writings\u2014specifically, the\nSophist, the Timaeus, and the\nLaws\u2014but they are never brought together into a\ncoherent theory. Hartshorne sees process theism as providing the\nneeded coherence (Dombrowski 2005 and Viney 2007).\n\nIn the generation immediately preceding Whitehead, C. S. Peirce\n(1839\u20131914) and William James (1842\u20131910) closely\nanticipated process theism and served as important influences on its\ndevelopment. There was also a cross fertilization of ideas from some\nof Whitehead\u2019s contemporaries: Henri Bergson (1859\u20131941),\nSamuel Alexander (1859\u20131938), and William Ernest Hocking\n(1873\u20131966)\u2014Hocking was one of Hartshorne\u2019s teachers\nat Harvard. Philosophers and religious thinkers who independently\nformulated aspects of process theism in the twentieth century include:\nBernardino Varisco (1850\u20131933), Nicholas Berdyaev\n(1874\u20131948), Mohammad Iqbal (1877\u20131938), Martin Buber\n(1878\u20131965), Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881\u20131955), Edgar\nSheffield Brightman (1884\u20131953), Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan\n(1888\u20131975), Sri Aurobindo (1892\u20131950), Hans Jonas\n(1903\u20131993), and Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907\u20131972).\n\nBecause process theists reject the idea of a deity whose moral\ncharacter is ever questionable, John Stuart Mill\u2019s essay,\n\u201cTheism,\u201d is not an anticipation of process\ntheism. By parity of reasoning, Peter Forrest\u2019s proposal of a\nGod that grows from pure power to pure love is not a version of theism\nthat process theists would find appealing (Forrest 2007). Some of the\ncentral themes and arguments of process theism, however, are evident\nin less well-known thinkers scattered throughout history. One can\nmention the names of Levi ben Gerson (1288\u20131340), Fausto Socinus\n(1539\u20131604), Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling (1775\u20131854),\nGustav Theodor Fechner (1801\u20131887), Rowland Gibson Hazard\n(1801\u20131888), Jules Lequyer [or Lequier] (1814\u20131862),\nLorenzo D. McCabe (1817\u20131897), and Otto Pfleiderer\n(1839\u20131908). Some might count G. W. F. Hegel (1770\u20131831)\nas a forerunner of process theism, but his case is not clear. The idea\nof development is central to Hegel\u2019s thinking about the Absolute\nSpirit. On the other hand, his philosophy was more influential in\nushering in what he himself called \u201cthe death of God\u201d than\nin providing a clearly articulated theistic alternative to\nclassical theism (cf. K\u00fcng 1980, 138\u201342). It is also ironic\nthat it was much less in the positive influence of Hegelian idealism\nthan in the negative reactions to it that process philosophy, and by\nimplication process theism, matured in the twentieth century.\n\nPhilosophers and theologians who have published a monograph defending\nsome variety of process theism informed by Whitehead or Hartshorne\ninclude: Henry Nelson Wieman (1884\u20131975), Bernard Meland\n(1899\u20131993), Paul Weiss (1901\u20132002), Norman Pittenger\n(1905\u20131997), Daniel Day Williams (1910\u20131973), John Moskop,\nWilliam L. Reese, John B. Cobb, Jr., Schubert Ogden (1928-2019), Edgar\nA. Towne (1928-2018), Eugene H. Peters (1929\u20131983), Bowman\nClarke (1927\u20131996), Joseph Bracken, Burton Z. Cooper, Marjorie\nHewitt Suchocki, Gene A. Reeves, Lewis S. Ford (1933-2018),\nAndr\u00e9 Gounelle, Rem B. Edwards, Delwin Brown (1935\u20132009),\nDavid A. Pailin, Franklin I.
