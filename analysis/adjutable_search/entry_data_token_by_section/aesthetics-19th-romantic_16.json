    "main_text": "Aesthetics and Nature || The Worry\n5.1 The Worry\n\n\nWe have fallen out with nature, and what was once (as we believe) One\nis now in conflict with itself, and mastery and servitude alternate on\nboth sides. It often seems to us as if the world were everything and\nwe nothing, but often too as if we were everything and the world\nnothing. (H\u00f6lderlin, Preface to Hyperion, HSA 3:\n326).\n\n\nH\u00f6lderlin expresses here a ubiquitous romantic sentiment. Not\nonly has modernity divided man from himself by enforcing the duality\nbetween reason and sensibility and severed the individual from his\nnatural social relations (section 4), but it also alienated man from\nnature. Modern science, \u201c[a] vulture, whose wings are dull\nrealities\u201d, was regarded as the main culprit (Edgar Allen Poe,\n\u201cSonnet\u2014To Science\u201d).\n\nThrough the lens of modern science, nature was regarded as an\ninanimate, mechanistic domain of dead and meaningless matter that is\ncomposed of separate atoms and thoroughly determined by efficient\ncausality. Modern science \u201cdissected [nature] atomistically like\na dead corpse\u201d (Eichendorff, EW 5: 423). The romantics regarded\nthis approach to nature as reductive as much as they regarded it as\n\u201cdissecting\u201d: it reduces nature to mere matter,\ndevoid of the features that the romantics took to be essential to it,\nlike holistic unity, self-organization and life. The growing sense of\nman\u2019s alienation from his natural surrounding was seen as a\nproduct of this reduction of nature: human beings seemed alienated\nfrom nature exactly because the rational, soulful and sense-making\ncharacter that is usually associated with them is opposed to a\nmechanistic and deterministic domain.\n\nThe troublesome consequences of this approach to nature are multiple.\nFirst, there is the psychological and existential crisis that is well\nencapsulated by Novalis\u2019s claim, \u201cPhilosophy is actually\nhomesickness\u2014the urge to be everywhere at home\u201d\n(General Draft: #45), and commemorated by landmark romantic\nworks, such as Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s \u201cThe Wanderer\nabove the Mist\u201d (1818).\n\nIn the epistemological and metaphysical domains, varieties of\nskeptical doubts loom large behind the modern approach to nature. If\nmodern science is right then the relation between nature and\nnormativity is unclear. But if nature cannot provide rational norms,\nthen how can we account for and justify our empirical claims to\nknowledge (human experience)? On the flipside of this epistemological\nworry is a metaphysical concern about the nature of the subject. For\nthe subject, as the source of meaning, is seen as only\nthat\u2014a dematerialized source of meaning, devoid not only of a\nbody, as Descartes emphasized, but, if Kant is right, of any\nsubstantiality at all (see Bernstein 2003).\n\nThird among the consequences is the threat to any awe-inspiring stance\ntowards the world. Not only can the divinity once attributed to nature\nno longer be found therein, but modern science was also seen as posing\na challenge to any attempt at a secular alternative to religion. Seen\nas fully accessible to the calculative part of the human mind, nature\nbecomes transparent and devoid of any mystery or human-transcending\npower. Are we left without a source of wonder, awe or reverence in our\nmodern world?\n\nAccording to the romantics, the way out of these worrisome\nconsequences requires that we recognize that modern science is\nreductive not only in terms of its object\u2014nature\u2014but also\nin terms of its methodology: modern science employs merely what\nWordsworth called the \u201cindependent intellect\u201d. The\nromantics understood this as calculative reason when it is isolated\nfrom non-calculative reason, sensibility and imagination. Employed\nthusly, the independent intellect works as a \u201cknife in\nhand\u201d (Wordsworth, The Prelude (1805), book X, line\n877).\n\nThis is crucial because, if the romantics are to retrieve the lost\nunity of nature itself and our lost unity with nature, they must\npropose a new scientific methodology, or, what comes to the same\nthing, a new approach to nature. The romantics aspired to reform and\ncounterbalance the merely calculative, quantitative and mathematical\nuse of reason that is characteristic of modern science, and open an\nera \u201cWhen no more numbers and figures feature//As the keys to\nunlock every creature\u201d (Novalis, Henry von Ofterdingen,\nNS 1:344). Human beings should strive to return to \u201cthe laws of\nthings which lie/beyond the reach of human will or power;/The life of\nnature\u201d (Wordsworth, \u201cThe Tables Turned\u201d, 1798, LB)\nby adopting a more holistic approach that includes practical reason,\nsensibility, feeling, imagination, and above all the aesthetic\ncapacity of the mind.\n\nIt should be no surprise that this holistic approach to\nnature\u2014the new romantic science\u2014is, in essence, poetic. It\nis romantic poetry, which, as Athenaeum Fragments (AF) #116\nannounces, \u201cfuses and mixes\u201d opposing forces: reason,\nfeeling, imagination, physics, poetry, philosophy, medicine and\nalchemy\u2014when it comes to methodology\u2014and matter, form,\nfreedom and nature\u2014when it comes to the object of study,\nnature:\n\nAnyone who finds in infinite nature nothing but one whole, one\ncomplete poem, in every word, every syllable of which the harmony of\nthe whole rings out and nothing destroys it, has won the highest prize\nof all. (Ritter, Fragmente 2: 205)\n",
