    "main_text": "Argumentation Across Fields of Inquiry and Social Practices || Cognitive science and psychology\n4.3 Cognitive science and psychology\n\nArgumentation is also an important topic of investigation within\ncognitive science and psychology. Researchers in these fields are\npredominantly interested in the descriptive question of how people in\nfact engage in argumentation, rather than in the normative question of\nhow they ought to do it (although some of them have also drawn\nnormative conclusions, e.g., Hahn & Oaksford 2006; Hahn &\nHornikx, 2016). Controlled experiments are one of the ways in which the descriptive question can be investigated.\n\nSystematic research specifically on argumentation within\ncognitive science and psychology has significantly increased over the\nlast 10 years. Before that, there had been extensive research on\nreasoning conceived as an individual, internal process, much of which\nhad been conducted using task materials such as syllogistic arguments\n(Dutilh Novaes 2020b). But due to what may be described as an\nindividualist bias in cognitive science and psychology (Mercier 2018),\nthese researchers did not draw explicit connections between their\nfindings and the public acts of \u201cgiving and asking for\nreasons\u201d. It is only somewhat recently that argumentation began\nto receive sustained attention from these researchers. The\ninvestigations of Hugo Mercier and colleagues (Mercier & Sperber\n2017; Mercier 2018) and of Ulrike Hahn and colleagues (Hahn &\nOaksford 2007; Hornikx & Hahn 2012; Collins & Hahn 2018) have\nbeen particularly influential. (See also Paglieri, Bonelli, &\nFelletti 2016, an edited volume containing a representative overview\nof research on the psychology of argumentation.) Another interesting\nline of research has been the study of the development of reasoning\nand argumentative skills in young children (K\u00f6ymen, Mammen, &\nTomasello 2016; K\u00f6ymen & Tomasello 2020).\n\nMercier and Sperber defend an interactionist account of reasoning,\naccording to which the primary function of reasoning is for social\ninteractions, where reasons are exchanged and receivers of reasons\ndecide whether they find them convincing\u2014in other words, for\nargumentation (Mercier & Sperber 2017). They review a wealth of\nevidence suggesting that reasoning is rather flawed when it comes to\ndrawing conclusions from premises in order to expand one\u2019s\nknowledge. From this they conclude, on the basis of evolutionary\narguments, that the function of reasoning must be a different one,\nindeed one that responds to features of human sociality and the need\nto exercise epistemic vigilance when receiving information from\nothers. This account has inaugurated a rich research program which they have been pursuing with colleagues for over\na decade now, and which has delivered some interesting results\u2014for\nexample, that we seem to be better at evaluating the quality of\narguments proposed by others than at formulating high-quality arguments\nourselves (Mercier 2018).\n\nIn the context of the Bayesian (see entry on\n Bayes\u2019 theorem)\n approach to reasoning that was first developed by Mike Oaksford and\nNick Chater in the 1980s (Oaksford & Chater 2018), Hahn and\ncolleagues have extended the Bayesian framework to the investigation\nof argumentation. They claim that Bayesian probabilities offer an\naccurate descriptive model of how people evaluate the strength of\narguments (Hahn & Oaksford 2007) as well as a solid perspective to\naddress normative questions pertaining to argument strength (Hahn\n& Oaksford 2006; Hahn & Hornikx 2016). The Bayesian approach\nallows for the formulation of probabilistic measures of argument\nstrength, showing that many so-called \u201cfallacies\u201d may\nnevertheless be good arguments in the sense that they considerably\nraise the probability of the conclusion. For example, deductively\ninvalid argument schemes (such as affirming the consequent (AC) and\ndenying the antecedent (DA)) can also provide considerable support for\na conclusion, depending on the contents in question. The extent to\nwhich this is the case depends primarily on the specific informational\ncontext, captured by the prior probability distribution, not on the\nstructure of the argument. This means that some instances of, say, AC,\nmay offer support to a conclusion while others may fail to do so (Eva\n& Hartmann 2018). Thus seen, Bayesian argumentation represents a\nsignificantly different approach to argumentation from those inspired\nby logic (e.g., argument schemes), but they are not necessarily incompatible;\nthey may well be complementary perspectives (see also [Zenker\n2013]).\n",
