    "main_text": "Activism\n4. Activism\n\nGiven the deep relationship in critical disability approaches between\ntheory and praxis, this entry closes with a direct discussion of\nactivism, including influential individual activists, along with their\nprojects, and collectives doing significant work. Activism around\ncritical disability theory engages a variety of topics, from\nimmigration and unjust hiring practices to ableism and storytelling.\nBecause of the material impacts of oppression, including economic\noppression, and exclusions in higher education, many of these\nactivists use popular web platforms, including social media, to engage\nin their advocacy and disseminate their work. Online efforts, policy\npromotion, and advocacy are covered to indicate efforts currently\nundertaken by those working under the critical disability theory\numbrella.\n\nCritical disability activism is conducted publicly through online\nforums. Education, writing, and advocacy tools are offered online, in\naddition to critical analysis of politics, news, history, and ideas.\nIndividual activists and collectivists offer these tools and writings\nand often crowdsource support, both material and intellectual.\nActivist Vilissa Thompson, the author of the blog Ramp Your\nVoice!, is deeply engaged at the intersection of critical race\nand disability theory, writing, collecting and disseminating\nscholarship and doing advocacy work embedded at this nexus. According\nto the blog\u2019s mission statement, Ramp Your Voice!\nfosters self-advocacy and offers educational tools and services,\nincluding workshops and public speaking supporting disabled people,\nincluding, especially, disabled girls and women of color. Thompson\nalso offers the blog as a platform for writing by disabled people.\n\nActivist Alice Wong leads the Disability Visibility Project. The project\nmission, since its founding in 2014, is to provide online space\n\u201cdedicated to recording, amplifying, and sharing disability\nmedia and culture\u201d (Disability Visibility Project).\nWong focuses on collecting oral history and collaborates in this work\nwith her DVP\u2019s partner organization, StoryCorps. Influential\nwriter Mia Mingus maintains a blog promoting critical disability\nactivism, Leaving Evidence, and was formerly the coordinator\nof Black Girl Dangerous, which still serves as an important\nonline archive of critical intersectional work and a springboard for\nactivism.\n\nPhilosopher Shelley Tremain regularly blogs in online forums,\nexamining political and social matters relevant to disability. She\nfocuses especially on issues for disabled persons in academia, with\nspecific attention to philosophy. To date, Tremain has conducted 50\ninterviews with disabled, queer, and POC academic philosophers about\ntheir experiences, their subject positions, and how ableism impacts\ntheir work. This series of interviews, called \u201cDialogues on\nDisability\u201d, is a significant public philosophy project. First\nhosted on the blog Discrimination and Disadvantage, the full\narchive and new interviews can now be found on the blog\nBIOPOLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. Together with Tremain\u2019s other\npublic writings, and the other writing available from a variety of\nscholars on both blogs, the Dialogues on Disability project\nconstitutes an archive that raises the profile of issues facing\ndisabled academics while at the same time exploring\ncritical-theoretical and intersectional work on disability.\n\nLydia X. Z. Brown, an activist, community organizer, and legal\nadvocate, maintains a network of internet resources and blog under the\nname Autistic Hoya. Autistic Hoya is a crucial\nresource on ableism, language, and the experiences and activist work\nof disabled and queer POC. It is also a jumping-off point for fighting\nagainst institutionalization alongside Brown, including the Judge\nRotenberg Educational Center. JRC uses the \u201cgraduated electronic\ndecelerator\u201d, which causes electric shocks, to control behavior\n(Bruno 2016). Autistic Hoya, thanks to Brown\u2019s\nscholarly labor and activism, is a significant public archive for\ncritical disability theory activism. Significant online resources\nbeyond these examples exist. Meanwhile, critical disability theorists\nwork to influence policy, dealing with topics from\ninstitutionalization to social services to law. Brown, a lawyer, is\nJustice Catalyst Fellow at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\nIn this role, they support \n\n\nthe educational civil rights of Maryland students with psychosocial,\nintellectual, and developmental disabilities facing various forms of\ndisproportionate discipline, restraint and seclusion, and school\npushout. \n (Autistic Hoya, Sept. 23, 2019) \n\n\n\nBrown served as Chairperson of the Massachusetts Developmental\nDisabilities Council from 2015\u20132017, is a founding board member\nof the Alliance for Citizen-Directed Services, and is a board member\nof the Autism Women\u2019s Network. Brown was a Fellow with the\nNational LGBTQ Task Force, and has worked for the Autistic Self\nAdvocacy Network, among other key roles and grassroots activism\n(Autistic Hoya). In all of these ways, Brown has sought to\ndirectly influence policy using a critical disability approach.\n\nFinally, direct advocacy on behalf of disabled people, both personal\nand political, is a key part of critical disability activism. Wong, a\nformer U.S. presidential appointee to the National Council on\nDisability, is a significant advocate. She works with\nDisabledWriters.com, promoting the careers of disabled writers and\njournalists, and #CripTheVote, a non-partisan movement to put\ndisability on political agendas and mobilize disabled people. Brown,\nalong with Mor\u00e9nike Giwa Onaiwu, directs the Fund for Community\nReparations for Autistic People of Color\u2019s Interdependence,\nSurvival, and Empowerment. This fund supports autistic people of color\ndirectly and materially, and is just one of many ways Brown extends\ntheir influence in order to advocate for individual disabled\npeople.\n\nCommunity activism also occurs through collectives. These collectives\naccomplish key foundational work that allows access to fundamental\ninformation, communication, and activism around oppression, including\nbut not limited to police brutality, inaccessibility, and hermeneutic\ninjustice. A (non-exhaustive) list of notable examples include: the\nHarriet Tubman Collective, a group of black Deaf and disabled\nactivists; Helping Educate to Advance the Rights of Deaf Communities;\nKrip-Hop Nation, founded by Leroy F. Moore Jr., which includes\ndisabled hip hop artists and lifts the voices of disabled African\nAmericans in music and media; the National Black Disability Coalition,\na U.S. national organization founded in 1990 for black disabled\npeople; the National Coalition for Latinxs with Disabilities, a U.S.\nnational organization for individuals who identify as Latinx and\ndisabled; and, Rooted in Rights, a project of Disability Rights\nWashington that focuses on disability rights issues using videos and\nsocial media. \u201cStorytellers\u201d for Rooted in Rights\nparticipate internationally, broadening the scope of its impact.\n\nThe links to the websites, blogs, and online spaces highlighted in\nthis section are collected under the heading\n \u201cOther Internet Resources\u201d,\n below. This section is mostly limited to North American and\nEnglish-language examples; suggestions to expand its scope, addressed\nto the author of this entry, are welcome.\n",
