    "main_text": "Probabilistic Causal Models || Latent Common Causes\n4.6 Latent Common Causes\n\nThe discussion so far has focused on the case where there are no\nlatent common causes of the variables in \\(\\bV\\), and the error\nvariables \\(U_i\\) can be expected to be probabilistically independent.\nAs we noted in\n Section 2.3\n above, we represent a latent common cause with a double-headed arrow.\nFor example, the acyclic directed mixed graph in\n Figure 9\n represents a latent common cause of X and Z. More\ngenerally, we can use an ADMG like Figure 9 to represent that the\nerror variables for X and Z are not probabilistically\nindependent.\n\n\n\nFigure 9\n\n\nIf there are latent common causes, we expect MCScreening_off and MCFactorization to fail if we apply them in a\nna\u00efve way. In\n Figure 9,\n Y is the only parent of Z shown in the graph, and if we\ntry to apply MCScreening_off, it tells us that Y should\nscreen X off from Z. However, we would expect X\nand Z to be correlated, even when we condition on Y, due\nto the latent common cause. The problem is that the graph is missing a\nrelevant parent of Z, namely the omitted common cause. However,\nsuppose that the probability distribution on \\(\\{L, X, Y, Z\\}\\)\nsatisfies MC with respect to the DAG that includes L as a\ncommon cause of X and Z. Then it turns out that the\nprobability distribution will still satisfy MCd-separation with respect to the ADMG of Figure 9. A causal\nmodel incorporating an ADMG and probability distribution satisfying\nMCd-separation is called a semi-Markov\ncausal model (SMCM).\n\nIf we allow that the correct causal graph may be an ADMG, we can still\napply MCd-separation, and ask which graphs imply the\nsame sets of conditional independence relations. The Markov\nequivalence class will be larger than it was when we did not allow for\nlatent variables. For instance, suppose that the probability\ndistribution on \\(\\{X, Y, Z\\}\\) has the following features:\n\nX and Y are dependent unconditionally, and\nconditional on Z\nY and Z are dependent unconditionally, and\nconditional on X\nX and Z are independent unconditionally, but\ndependent conditional on Y\n\n\nWe saw in\n Section 4.4\n that the only DAG that implies just these (in)dependencies is:\n\n\\[\nX \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow Z\n\\]\n\n\nBut if we allow for the possibility of latent common causes, there\nwill be additional ADMGs that also imply just these (in)dependencies.\nFor example, the structure \n\n\\[\nX \\leftrightarrow Y \\leftrightarrow Z\n\\]\n\n\nis also in the Markov equivalence class, as are several others.\n\nLatent variables present a further complication. Unlike the case where\nthe error variables \\(U_i\\) are probabilistically independent, a SEM\nwith correlated error terms may imply probabilistic constraints in\naddition to conditional (in)dependence relations, even in the absence\nof further assumptions about functional form. This means that we may\nbe able to rule out some of the ADMGs in the Markov equivalence class\nusing different kinds of probabilistic constraints.\n",
