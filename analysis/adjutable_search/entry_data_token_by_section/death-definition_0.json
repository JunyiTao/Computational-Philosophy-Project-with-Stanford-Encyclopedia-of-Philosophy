The Current Mainstream View: The Whole-Brain Approach\n\nAccording to the whole-brain standard, human death is the\nirreversible cessation of functioning of the entire brain, including\nthe brainstem. This standard is generally associated with an\norganismic definition of death (as explained below). Unlike the older\ncardiopulmonary standard, the whole-brain standard assigns\nsignificance to the difference between assisted and\nunassisted respiration. A mechanical respirator can enable\nbreathing, and thereby circulation, in a \u201cbrain-dead\u201d\npatient\u2014a patient whose entire brain is irreversibly\nnonfunctional. But such a patient necessarily lacks the capacity for\nunassisted respiration. On the old view, such a patient\ncounted as alive so long as respiration of any sort (assisted or\nunassisted) occurred. But on the whole-brain account, such a patient\nis dead. The present approach also maintains that someone in a\npermanent (irreversible) vegetative state is alive because a\nfunctioning brainstem enables spontaneous respiration and\ncirculation as well as certain primitive\n reflexes.[1]\n\nBefore turning to arguments for and against the whole-brain standard,\nit may be helpful to review some basic facts about the human brain,\n\u201cwhole-brain death\u201d (total brain failure), and other\nstates of permanent (irreversible) unconsciousness. (The most\nimportant terms for our purposes appear in italics.) We may think of\nthe brain as comprising two major portions: (1) the \u201chigher\nbrain,\u201d consisting of both the cerebrum, the\nprimary vehicle of conscious awareness, and the cerebellum, which is\ninvolved in the coordination and control of voluntary muscle\nmovements; and (2) the \u201clower brain\u201d or\nbrainstem. The brainstem includes the medulla, which\ncontrols spontaneous respiration, the reticular activating\nsystem, a sort of on/off switch that enables consciousness\nwithout affecting its contents (the latter job belonging to the\ncerebrum), as well as the midbrain and pons.\n\nWith these basic concepts in view, it may be easier to contrast\nvarious states of permanent unconsciousness. (For a helpful overview,\nsee Cranford 1995.) \u201cWhole-brain death\u201d or\ntotal brain failure involves the destruction of the entire\nbrain, both the higher brain and the brainstem. By contrast, in a\npermanent (irreversible) vegetative state\n(PVS), while the higher brain is extensively damaged, causing\nirretrievable loss of consciousness, the brainstem is largely intact.\nThus, as noted earlier, a patient in a PVS is alive according to the\nwhole-brain standard. Retaining brainstem functions, PVS patients\nexhibit some or all of the following: unassisted respiration and\nheartbeat; wake and sleep cycles (made possible by an intact reticular\nactivating system, though destruction to the cerebrum precludes\nconsciousness); pupillary reaction to light and eyes movements; and\nsuch reflexes as swallowing, gagging, and coughing. A rare form of\nunconsciousness that is distinct from PVS and tends to lead fairly\nquickly to death is permanent (irreversible)\ncoma. This state, in which patients never appear to be awake,\ninvolves partial brainstem functioning. Permanently comatose patients,\nlike PVS patients, can maintain breathing and heartbeat without\nmechanical assistance.\n\nWith this background, we turn to the advantages and disadvantages of\nthe whole-brain approach. First, what considerations favor this\napproach over the traditional focus on cardiopulmonary function in\ndetermining death? The most prominent and arguably the most powerful\ncase for the whole-brain standard appeals to two considerations: (1)\nthe organismic definition of death and (2) an emphasis on the brain's\nrole as the primary integrator of overall bodily functioning. (Some\nwho regard a general definition of death as unnecessary have focused\non consideration (2) in defending the whole-brain standard. Some\nothers, as discussed later, have retained consideration (1) but\ndropped consideration (2).) An additional consideration that has been\ninfluential, yet is logically separable from the other two, is (3) the\nthesis that the whole-brain standard updates, without replacing, the\ntraditional approach to defining death.\n\nAccording to the organismic definition, death is the irreversible\nloss of functioning of the organism as a whole (Becker 1975;\nBernat, Culver, and Gert 1981). Proponents of this approach emphasize\nthat death is a biological occurrence common to all organisms.\nAlthough individual cells and organs live and die, organisms are the\nonly entities that literally do so without being parts of larger\nbiological systems. (Ideas, cultures, and machines live and die only\nfiguratively; cells and tissues are literally alive but are parts of\nlarger biological systems.) So an adequate definition of death must be\nadequate in the case of all organisms. What happens when a paramecium,\nclover, tree, mosquito, rabbit, or human dies? The organism stops\nfunctioning as an integrated unit and breaks down, turning what was\nonce a dynamic object that took energy from the environment to\nmaintain its own structure and functioning into an inert piece of\nmatter subject to disintegration and decay. In the case of humans, no\nless than other organisms, death involves the collapse of integrated\nbodily functioning.\n\nThe whole-brain standard does not follow straightforwardly from the\norganismic conception of death. One might insist, after all, that a\nhuman organism's death occurs upon irreversible loss of\ncardiopulmonary function. Why think the brain so important? According\nto the mainstream whole-brain approach, the human brain plays the\ncrucial role of integrating major bodily functions so only the death\nof the entire brain is necessary and sufficient for a human being's\ndeath (Bernat, Culver, and Gert 1981). Although heartbeat and\nbreathing normally indicate life, they do not constitute life. Life\ninvolves integrated functioning of the whole organism. Circulation and\nrespiration are centrally important, but so are maintenance of body\ntemperature, hormonal regulation, and various other functions\u2014as\nwell as, in humans and other higher animals, consciousness. The brain\nmakes all of these vital functions possible. Their integration within\nthe organism is due to a central integrator, the brain.\n\nThis leading case for the whole-brain standard, then, consists in an\norganismic conception of death coupled with a view of the brain as the\nchief integrator of interdependent bodily functions. Another\nconsideration sometimes advanced in favor of the whole-brain standard\npositions it as a part of time-honored tradition rather than a\ndeparture from tradition. (The argument may be understood either as an\nappeal to the authority of tradition or as an appeal to the\npracticality of not departing radically from tradition.) The claim is\nthat the traditional focus on cardiopulmonary function is part and\nparcel of the whole-brain approach, that the latter does not revise\nour understanding of death but merely updates it with a more\ncomprehensive picture that highlights the brain's crucial role:\n\nThree organs\u2014the heart, lungs, and brain\u2014assume special\nsignificance \u2026 because their interrelationship is close and the\nirreversible cessation of any one very quickly stops the other two and\nconsequently halts the integrated functioning of the organism as a\nwhole. Because they were easily measured, circulation and respiration\nwere traditionally the basic \u201cvital signs.\u201d But [they] are\nsimply used as signs\u2014as one window for viewing a deeper and more\ncomplex reality: a triangle of interrelated systems with the brain at\nits apex. [T]he traditional means of diagnosing death actually\ndetected an irreversible cessation of integrated functioning among the\ninterdependent bodily systems. When artificial means of support mask\nthis loss of integration as measured by the old methods,\nbrain-oriented criteria and tests provide a new window on the same\nphenomena (President's Commission 1981, 33).\n\n\nAccording to this view, when the entire brain is nonfunctional but\ncardiopulmonary function continues due to a respirator and perhaps\nother life-supports, the mechanical assistance presents a false\nappearance of life, concealing the absence of integrated functioning\nin the organism as a whole.\n\nThe whole-brain approach clearly enjoys advantages. First, whether or\nnot the whole-brain standard really incorporates, rather than\nreplacing, the traditional cardiopulmonary standard, the former is at\nleast fairly continuous with traditional practices and understandings\nconcerning human death. Indeed, current law in the American states\nincorporates both standards into disjunctive form, most states\nadopting the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) while others\nhave embraced similar language (Bernat 2006, 40). The UDDA states that\n\u201c\u2026 an individual who has sustained either (1)\nirreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or\n(2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain,\nincluding the brainstem, is dead,\u201d (President's Commission 1981,\n119). Similar legal developments have occurred in Canada (Law Reform\nCommission of Canada 1981; Canadian Congress Committee on Brain Death\n1988). The close pairing of the whole-brain and cardiopulmonary\nstandards in the law suggests that the whole-brain standard does not\ndepart radically from tradition.\n\nThe present approach offers other advantages as well. For one, the\nwhole-brain standard is prima facie plausible as a specification of\nthe organismic definition of death in the case of human beings.\nMoreover, acceptance of whole-brain criteria for death facilitates\norgan transplantation by permitting a declaration of death and\nretrieval of still-viable organs while respiration and circulation\ncontinue, with mechanical assistance, in a \u201cbrain-dead\u201d\nbody. Another practical advantage is permitting, without an advance\ndirective or proxy consent, discontinuation of costly life-support\nmeasures on patients who have incurred total brain failure. While most\nproponents of the whole-brain approach insist that such practical\nadvantages are merely fortunate consequences of the biological facts\nabout death, one might regard these advantages as part of the\njustification for a standard whose defense requires more than appeals\nto biology (see subsection 4.2 below).\n\nThe advantages proffered by this approach contributed to its\nwidespread social acceptance and legal adoption in the last few\ndecades of the 20th century. As mentioned, every American\nstate has legally adopted the whole-brain standard alongside the\ncardiopulmonary standard as in the UDDA. It is worth noting, however,\nthat a close cousin to the whole-brain standard, the brainstem\nstandard, was adopted by the United Kingdom and various other\nnations. According to the brainstem standard\u2014which has the\npractical advantage of requiring fewer clinical tests\u2014human\ndeath occurs at the irreversible cessation of brainstem function. One\nmight wonder whether a person's cerebrum could function\u2014enabling\nconsciousness\u2014while this standard is met, but the answer is no.\nSince the brainstem includes the reticular activating system, the\non/off switch that makes consciousness possible (without affecting its\ncontents), brainstem death entails irreversible loss not only of\nunassisted respiration and circulation but also of the capacity for\nconsciousness. Importantly, outside the English-speaking world, many\nor most nations, including virtually all developed countries, have\nlegally adopted either whole-brain or brainstem criteria for the\ndetermination of death (Wijdicks 2002). Moreover, most of the public,\nto the extent that it is aware of the relevant laws, appears to accept\nsuch criteria for death (ibid). Opponents commonly fall within one of\ntwo main groups. One group consists of religious\nconservatives\u2014and, recently, a growing number of secular\nacademics\u2014who favor the cardiopulmonary standard, according to\nwhich one can be brain-dead yet alive if (assisted) cardiopulmonary\nfunction persists. The other group consists of those liberal\nintellectuals who favor the higher-brain standard (to be discussed),\nwhich, notably, has not been adopted by any jurisdiction.\n\nThe widespread acceptance in the U.S. of the whole-brain standard and\nthe broader international acceptance of some sort of \u201cbrain\ndeath\u201d criteria\u2014whether whole-brain or brainstem\u2014are\nremarkable considering the subtlety of issues surrounding the\ndefinition and determination of death. Yet this near-consensus has\nbeen broader than it is deep. Increasingly, both in academic and\nclinical circles, doubts about \u201cbrain death\u201d are being\nvoiced. Following are several major challenges to the whole-brain\nstandard\u2014and, implicitly, to the brainstem standard. (Several\nadditional challenges are implicit in arguments supporting the\nhigher-brain approach.)\n\nThe first challenge is directed at proponents of the whole-brain\napproach who claim that its standard merely updates, without\nreplacing, the traditional cardiopulmonary standard. A major\ncontention that motivates this thesis is that irreversible cessation\nof brain function will quickly lead to irreversible loss of\ncardiopulmonary function (and vice versa). But extended maintenance on\nrespirators of patients with total brain failure has removed this\ncomponent of the case for the whole-brain standard (PCB 2008, 90). The\nremaining challenges to the whole-brain approach are not specifically\ndirected to those who assert that its standard merely updates the\ntraditional cardiopulmonary standard.\n\nFirst, in the case of at least some members of our species, total\nbrain failure is not necessary for death. After all, human\nembryos and early fetuses can die although, lacking brains, they\ncannot satisfy whole-brain criteria for death (Persson 2002,\n22\u201323). An advocate could respond by introducing a modified\ndefinition: In the case of any human being in possession of a\nfunctioning brain, death is the irreversible cessation of\nfunctioning of the entire brain. While this may be practically useful\nin the world as we know it for the foreseeable future, this definition\nis not conceptually satisfactory if it is possible in principle for\nsome human beings with brains (that is, who have functioning brains at\nany point in their existence) to die without destruction of their\nbrains. The \u201cin principle\u201d is important here, for this is\nnot possible in our world currently. But suppose we develop the\nability to transplant brains. (The thought-experiment that follows\nappears in McMahan 2002, 429.) Recall that the whole-brain standard is\ngenerally thought to receive support from an organismic definition of\ndeath. But such a conception of human death, one could argue, only\nmakes sense on the assumption that we are essentially human organisms\n(see discussion of the essence of human persons in section\n2.1)\u2014as some proponents explicitly acknowledge (see, e.g., Olson\n1997). According to the present critique, the brain is merely a\npart of the organism. Suppose the brain were removed from one\nof us, and kept intact and functioning, perhaps by being transplanted\ninto another, de-brained body. Bereft of mechanical assistance, the\nbody from which the brain was removed would surely die. But this body\nwas the living organism, one of us. So, although the original brain\ncontinues to function, the human being, one of us, would have died.\nTotal brain failure, then, is not strictly necessary for human death.\nA possible rebuttal to this challenge from one who accepts that we are\nessentially organisms is to argue that the existence of a functioning\nbrain is sufficient for the continued existence of the organism (van\nInwagen 1990, 173\u2013174, 180\u2013181). If so, then in the\nimagined scenario the original human being would survive the brain\ntransplant in a new body. Thus, the rebuttal concludes, it is false\nthat a human being could die although her brain continued to live.\n\nPerhaps more threatening to the whole-brain approach is the growing\nempirical evidence that total brain failure is not sufficient\nfor human death \u2014assuming the latter is construed, as\nwhole-brain advocates generally construe it, as the breakdown of integrated\norganismic functioning mediated by the brain. Many of our integrative\nfunctions, according to the challenge, are not mediated by the brain\nand can therefore persist in individuals who meet whole-brain criteria\nfor death by standard clinical tests. Such somatically integrating\nfunctions include homeostasis, assimilation of nutrients,\ndetoxification and recycling of cellular wastes, elimination, wound\nhealing, fighting of infections, and cardiovascular and hormonal\nstress responses to unanesthetized incisions (for organ procurement);\nin a few cases, brain-dead bodies have even gestated a fetus, matured\nsexually, or grown in size (Shewmon 2001; Potts 2001). It has been\nargued that most brain functions commonly cited as integrative merely\nsustain an existing functional integration, suggesting that the brain\nis more an enhancer than an indispensable integrator of bodily\nfunctions (Shewmon 2001). Moreover, several studies have demonstrated\nthat most patients diagnosed as brain dead continue to exhibit some\nbrain functions including the regulated secretion of vasopressin, a\nhormone critical to maintaining a body's balance of salt and fluid\n(Halevy 2001). This hormonal regulation is a brain function that\nrepresents an integrated function of the organism as a whole (Miller\nand Truog 2010).\n\nAnother, related problem for the sufficiency of total brain failure\nfor human death arises from reflection on locked-in syndrome.\nPeople with locked-in syndrome are conscious, and therefore alive, but\ncompletely paralyzed with the possible exception of their eyes. With\nintensive medical support they can live. The interesting fact for our\npurposes is that some patients with this syndrome exhibit no more\nsomatic functioning integrated by the brain than some brain-dead\nindividuals. Whatever integration of bodily functions remains is\nmaintained by external supports and by bodily systems other than the\nbrain, which merely preserves consciousness (Bartlett and Youngner\n1988, 205\u20136). If total brain failure is supposed to be\nsufficient for death, and if this is true only because the\nformer entails the loss of somatic functioning integrated by the\nbrain, then the loss of those functions should also be sufficient for\ndeath. But these patients, who are clearly alive, show that this is\nnot so. Either the whole-brain definition must be rejected or\nthis particular reason for accepting the whole-brain approach must be\nrejected and some other good reason for accepting it found.\n\nRecently, a new rationale\u2014distinct from the one that understands\nhuman death in terms of loss of organismic functioning mediated by the\nbrain\u2014has been advanced in support of the whole-brain standard\n(PCB 2008, ch. 4). According to this rationale, a human being dies\nupon irreversibly losing the capacity to perform the fundamental\nwork of an organism, a loss that occurs with total brain failure.\nThe fundamental work of an organism is characterized as follows: (1)\nreceptivity to stimuli from the surrounding environment; (2) the\nability to act upon the world to obtain, selectively, what the\norganism needs; and (3) the basic felt need that drives the organism\nto act as it must to obtain what it needs and what its receptivity\nreveals to be available (ibid, 61). According to a sympathetic reading\nof the ambiguous discussion in which this analysis is advanced, any\npatient who meets even one of these criteria is alive and therefore\nnot dead. A patient with total brain failure meets none of these\ncriteria, even if a respirator permits the continuation of\ncardiopulmonary function. By contrast, PVS patients meet at least the\nsecond criterion through spontaneous respiration (a kind of acting\nupon the world to obtain what is needed: oxygen); and locked-in\npatients meet the first criterion if they can see or experience bodily\nsensation and certainly meet the third insofar as they are conscious.\nOne difficulty with this \u201cfundamental work\u201d rationale for\nthe whole-brain standard, a rationale that is intended to capture\n\u201cwhat distinguishes every organism from non-living things\u201d\n(ibid), is that some present-day robots, which are certainly not alive,\nseem to satisfy the first two criteria. If one insisted, contrary to\nthe reading deemed sympathetic, that a being must satisfy all three\ncriteria\u2014as robots do not since they lack felt needs\u2014in\norder to qualify as living, the same may be asserted not only of\ninsentient animal life but also of presentient human fetuses and of\nunconscious human beings of any age. Another difficulty of the\n\u201cfundamental work\u201d rationale for the whole brain standard is that it\nwas intended to replace the idea that integrated functional unity\nwithin an organism is what constitutes life\u2014but the latter idea\nis extremely plausible and helps to explain what any \u201cfundamental\nwork\u201d would be working toward (cf. Thomas 2012, 105). Whether any variation\nor modification of the present rationale for the whole-brain standard\ncan survive critical scrutiny remains an open question.\n\nSome traditional defenders of the cardiopulmonary approach believe\nthat the insufficiency of whole-brain criteria for death is evident\nnot only in exceptional cases, such as those described earlier, but in\nall cases in which patients with total brain failure exhibit\nrespirator-assisted cardiopulmonary function. Anyone who is breathing\nand whose heart functions cannot be dead, they claim. The champion of\nwhole-brain criteria may retort that such a body is not really\nbreathing and circulating blood; the respirator is doing the work. The\ntraditionalist, in response, will likely contend that what is\nimportant is not who or what is powering the breathing and heartbeat,\njust that they occur. Even complete dependence on external support for\nvital functions cannot entail that one is dead, the traditionalist\nwill continue, as is evident in the fact that living fetuses are\nentirely dependent on their mothers' bodies; nor can complete\ndependence on mechanical support entail that one is dead, as is\nevident in the fact that many living people are utterly dependent on\npacemakers.\n\nA third major criticism of the whole-brain approach\u2014at least in\nits legally authoritative formulation in the United\nStates\u2014concerns its conceptual and clinical adequacy. The\nwhole-brain standard, taken at its word, requires for human death\npermanent cessation of all brain functions. Yet many patients\nwho meet routine clinical tests for this standard continue to have\nminor brain functions such as electroencephalographic activity,\nisolated nests of living neurons, and hypothalamic functioning (see,\ne.g., Potts 2001, 482; Veatch 1993, 18; Nair-Collins and Miller\nforthcoming). Indeed, the latter, which controls neurohormonal\nregulation, is indisputably an\nintegrating function of the brain (Brody 1999, 73). Now one\ncould maintain the coherence of the whole-brain approach by insisting\nthat the individuals in question are not really dead and that\nphysicians ought to use more thorough clinical tests before declaring\ndeath (see, e.g., Capron 1999, 130\u2013131). But whole-brain\ntheorists tend to agree that these individuals are dead\u2014that the\nresidual functions are too trivial to count against a judgment of\ndeath (see, e.g., President's Commission 1981, 28\u201329; Bernat\n1992, 25)\u2014suggesting that the problem lies with the formulation\nof the whole-brain standard rather than with its spirit.\n\nWithin this spirit and in response to this challenge, a leading\nproponent of the whole-brain approach has revised both (1) the\norganismic definition of death to \u201cthe permanent cessation of\nthe critical functions of the organism as a whole\u201d and\n(2) the corresponding standard to permanent cessation of the\ncritical functions of the whole brain (Bernat 1998, 17). The\norganism's critical functions may be identified by reference to its\nemergent functions\u2014that is, properties of the whole\norganism that are not possessed by any of its component parts\u2014as\nfollows: \u201cThe irretrievable loss of the organism's emergent\nfunctions produces loss of the critical functioning of the organism as\na whole and therefore is the death of the organism,\u201d (Bernat\n2006, 38). The emphasis on critical functions, of course, allows one\nto declare dead those patients with only trivial brain functions.\nAccording to this revised whole-brain approach, the critical functions\nof the organism are (1) the vital functions of spontaneous breathing\nand autonomic circulation control, (2) integrating functions that\nmaintain the organism's homeostasis, and (3) consciousness. A human\nbeing dies upon losing all three. Whether this or some similar\nmodification of the whole-brain approach adequately addresses the\npresent challenge is a topic of ongoing debate (see, e.g., Brody 1999,\nBernat 2006). What seems reasonably clear is that not all functions of\nthe brain will count equally in any cogent defense of the whole-brain\napproach.\n\nThe judgment that some brain functions are trivial in this context\ninvites a reconsideration of what is most significant about what the\nhuman brain does. According to an alternative approach, what is far\nand away most significant about human brain function is\nconsciousness.\n",
