An empiricist framework,\nexemplified in John Stuart Mill\u2019s A System\nof Logic, suggests attempting to discern the meaning of a word,\nfor instance a proper name, in isolation. By\ncontrast, Gottlob Frege (1884) enjoins us to\nunderstand a word\u2019s meaning in terms of the contribution it makes to\nan entire sentence. Such a method is indispensable for a proper\ntreatment of such expressions as quantifiers, and represents a major\nadvance over empiricist approaches. Yet students of speech acts have\nespoused going even further, insisting that the unit of significance\nis not the proposition but the speech act. Vanderveken writes,\n\nIllocutionary acts are important for the purpose of philosophical\nsemantics because they are the primary units of meaning in the use and\ncomprehension of natural language. (Vanderveken, 1990, p. 1.)\n\nWhy not go even further, since speech acts characteristically occur\nin conversations? Is the unit of significance really the debate, the\ncolloquy, the interrogation?\n\nStudents of conversation analysis have contended precisely\nthis, remarking that many speech acts fall naturally into\npairs.[17] For\ninstance, questions pair naturally with assertions when the latter\npurport to be answers to those questions. Likewise, offers pair\nnaturally with acceptances or rejections, and it is easy to multiply\nexamples. Searle, who favors studying speech acts in isolation, has\nreplied to these considerations (Searle 1992).  There he issues a\nchallenge to students of conversation to provide an account of\nconversations parallel to that of speech acts, arguing as well that\nthe prospects for such an account are dim. One of his reasons is that\nunlike speech acts conversations do not as such have a point or\npurpose. Green 1999 rejoins that many conversations may indeed be\nconstrued in teleological terms. For instance, many conversations may\nbe construed as aimed at answering a question, even when that question\nconcerns something as banal as the afternoon\u2019s weather or the\nlocation of the nearest subway station. Asher and Lascardes (2003)\ndevelop a systematic treatment of speech acts in their conversational\nsetting that also responds to Searle\u2019s challenge. Additionally,\nRoberts (2004, 2012) develops a model of conversational kinematics\naccording to which conversations are invariably aimed at answering\nwhat she terms a question under discussion (QUD). This view\nis best appreciated within the framework of the \u201cscorekeeping\nmodel\u201d of conversation, to which we now turn.\n",
