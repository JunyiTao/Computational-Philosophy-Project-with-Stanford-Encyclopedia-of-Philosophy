    "main_text": "The Emergence of Procedural Rationality || Cumulative Prospect Theory\n2.4 Cumulative Prospect Theory\n\nIf both satisficing and improper linear models are examples addressing\nSimon\u2019s second question at the start of this\nsection\u2014namely, how to simplify existing models to render them\nboth tractable and effective\u2014then Daniel Kahneman and Amos\nTversky\u2019s cumulative prospect theory is among the first\nmodels to directly incorporate knowledge about how humans actually\nmake decisions.\n\nIn our discussion in\n section 1.1\n about alternatives to the Independence Axiom,\n (A3),\n we mentioned several observed features of human choice behavior that\nstand at odds with the prescriptions of expected utility theory.\nKahneman and Tversky developed prospect theory around four of those\nobservations about human decision-making (Kahneman & Tversky 1979;\nWakker 2010).\n\n\n\nReference Dependence. Rather than make decisions by\ncomparing the absolute magnitudes of welfare, as prescribed by\nexpected utility theory, people instead tend to value prospects by\ntheir change in welfare with respect to a reference point. This\nreference point can be a person\u2019s current state of wealth, an\naspiration level, or a hypothetical point of reference from which to\nevaluate options. The intuition behind reference dependence is that\nour sensory organs have evolved to detect changes in sensory stimuli\nrather than store and compare absolute values of stimuli. Therefore,\nthe argument goes, we should expect to see the cognitive mechanisms\ninvolved in decision-making to inherit this sensitivity to changes in\nperceptual attributes values.\n\nIn prospect theory, reference dependence is reflected by utility\nchanging sign at the origin of the valuation curve \\(v(\\cdot)\\) in\n Figure 1(a).\n The x-axis represents gains (right side) and losses (left\nside) in euros, and y-axis plots the value placed on relative\ngains and losses by a valuation function \\(v(\\cdot)\\), which is fit to\nexperimental data on people\u2019s choice behavior.\n\n\nLoss Aversion. People are more sensitive to losses\nthan gains of the same magnitude; the thrill of victory does not\nmeasure up to the agony of defeat. So, Kahneman and Tversky\nmaintained, people will prefer an option that does not incur a loss to\nan alternative option that yields an equivalent gain. The disparity in\nhow potential gains and losses are evaluated also accounts for the\nendowment effect, which is the tendency for people to value a good\nthat they own more than a comparatively valued substitute (Thaler\n1980).\n\nIn prospect theory, loss aversion appears in\n Figure 1(a)\n in the (roughly) steeper slope of \\(v(\\cdot)\\) to the left of the\norigin, representing losses relative to the subject\u2019s reference\npoint, than the slope of \\(v(\\cdot)\\) for gains on the right side of\nthe reference point. Thus, for the same magnitude of change in reward\nx from the reference point, the magnitude of the consequence\nof gaining x is less than the magnitude of losing x.\n\nNote that differences in affective attitudes toward, and the\nneurological processes responsible for processing, losses and gains do\nnot necessarily translate to differences in people\u2019s choice\nbehavior (Yechiam & Hochman 2014). The role and scope that loss\naversion plays in judgment and decision making is less clear than was\ninitially assumed\n (section 1.2).\n\n\nDiminishing Returns for both Gains and Losses. Given\na fixed reference point, people\u2019s sensitivity to changes in\nasset values (x in\n Figure 1a)\n diminish the further one moves from that reference point, both in the\ndomain of losses and the domain of gains. This is inconsistent with\nexpected utility theory, even when the theory is modified to\naccommodate diminishing marginal utility (M. Friedman & Savage\n1948).\n\nIn prospect theory, the valuation function \\(v(\\cdot)\\) is concave for\ngains and convex for losses, representing a diminishing sensitivity to\nboth gains and losses. Expected utility theory can be made to\naccommodate sensitivity effects, but the utility function is typically\neither strictly concave or strictly convex, not both.\n\n\nProbability Weighting. Finally, for known exogenous\nprobabilities, people do not calibrate their subjective probabilities\nby direct inference (Levi 1977), but instead systematically\nunderweight high-probability events and overweight low-probability\nevents, with a cross-over point of approximately one-third\n (Figure 1b).\n Thus, changes in very small or very large probabilities have greater\nimpact on the evaluation of prospects than they would under expected\nutility theory. People are willing to pay more to reduce the number of\nbullets in the chamber of a gun from 1 to 0 than from 4 bullets to 3\nin a hypothetical game of Russian roulette.\n\nFigure 1(b)\n plots the median values for the probability weighting function\n\\(w(\\cdot)\\) that takes the exogenous probability p associated\nwith prospects, as reported in Tversky & Kahneman 1992. Roughly,\nbelow probability values of one-third people overestimate the\nprobability of an outcome (consequence), and above probability\none-third people tend to underestimate the probability of an outcome\noccurring. Traditionally, overweighting is thought to concern the\nsystematic miscalibration of people\u2019s subjective estimates of\noutcomes against a known exogenous probability, p, serving as\nthe reference standard. In support of this view, miscalibration\nappears to disappear when people learn a distribution through sampling\ninstead of learning identical statistics by description (Hertwig,\nBarron, Weber, & Erev 2004). Miscalibration in this context ought\nto be distinguished from overestimating or underestimating subjective\nprobabilities when the relevant statistics are not supplied as part of\nthe decision task. For example, televised images of the aftermath of\nairplane crashes lead to an overestimation of the low-probability\nevent of commercial airplanes crashing. Even though a person\u2019s\nsubjective probability of the risk of a commercial airline crash would\nbe too high given the statistics, the mechanism responsible is\ndifferent: here the recency or availability of\nimages from the evening news is to blame for scaring him out of his\nwits, not the sober fumbling of a statistics table. An alternative\nview maintains that people understand that their weighted\nprobabilities are different than the exogenous probability but\nnevertheless prefer to act as if the exogenous probability were so\nweighted (Wakker 2010). On this view, probability weighting is not a\n(mistaken) belief but a preference.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1:\n (a) plots the value function \\(v(\\cdot)\\) applied to consequences of\na prospect; (b) plots the median value of the probability weighting\nfunction \\(w(\\cdot)\\) applied to positive prospects of the form \\((x,\np; 0, 1-p)\\) with probability p.\n[An extended description of this figure is in the supplement.]\n\n\n\nProspect theory incorporates these components into models of human\nchoice under risk by first identifying a reference point that either\nrefers to the status quo or some other aspiration level. The\nconsequences of the options under consideration then are framed in\nterms of deviations from this reference point. Extreme probabilities\nare simplified by rounding off, which yields miscalibration of the\ngiven, exogenous probabilities. Dominance reasoning is then applied,\nwhere dominated alternatives are eliminated from choice, along with\nadditional steps to separate options without risk, probabilities\nassociated with a specific outcome are combined, and a version of\neliminating irrelevant alternatives is applied (Kahneman & Tversky\n1979: 284\u2013285).\n\nNevertheless, prospect theory comes with problems. For example, a\nshift of probability from less favorable outcomes to more favorable\noutcomes ought to yield a better prospect, all things considered, but\nthe original prospect theory violates this principle of stochastic\ndominance. Cumulative prospect theory satisfies stochastic\ndominance, however, by appealing to a rank-dependent method for\ntransforming probabilities (Quiggin 1982).
