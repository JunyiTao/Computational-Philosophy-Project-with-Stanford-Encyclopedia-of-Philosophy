    "main_text": "New Directions for Neutral Monism || Realistic Empiricism: Powerful Qualities\n5.5 Realistic Empiricism: Powerful Qualities\n\nIn his book The Realistic Empiricism of Mach, James, and Russell.\nNeutral Monism Reconceived (2014), Erik Banks presents a critical\nsurvey of the big three of neutral monism, as well as his own\ndevelopment of the doctrine.\n\nThe neutral monist core of Banks\u2019s view amounts to this:\n\nindividual events are neutral, neither mental nor physical. Neutral\nevents make up \u201cphysical\u201d systems and extensions and\n\u201cmental\u201d sensations in minds through different functional\nrelations. (Banks 2014: 203)\n\n\nThis is very much in keeping with the traditional version of neutral\nmonism, especially Russell\u2019s event-based version. But Banks\nembeds this core idea into a larger metaphysical framework. The\nresulting theory is thoroughly original.\n\nIn a first step, Banks explains how this core idea fits into a larger\na posteriori physicalist picture. Physicalism, according to\nBanks, is best thought of as the view that mental supervenes on the\nphysical. Standard physicalism focuses on the question of how mental\nproperties and relations depend physical properties and relations. But\nBanks sides with the Russellian monist in holding that standard\nphysicalism does not specify the nature of the entities that exemplify\nthese properties and relations. So-called \u201cenhanced\nphysicalism\u201d goes beyond standard physicalism in specifying the\nnature of the entities that bear or instantiate the relevant\nproperties and relations:\n\nIn enhanced physicalism\u2026the instantiation of all physical\nproperties are individualized event particulars in causal-functional\nrelations to each other. (Banks 2014: 147)\n\n\nThis is how the neutral events slot into the enhanced physicalist\npicture that Banks favors.\n\nIn a second step, Banks provides us with an account of events. Events\nhave, and are individuated by, intrinsic characters or concrete\nqualities. None of those qualities are mental; but experience\nfamiliarizes us with some of them (see Banks 2014: 6). These qualities\nare the ways certain powers manifest themselves in events (see Banks\n2014: 6). Examples of such powers (or energies) include\nelectromagnetism, gravitation, and nuclear forces, and, most relevant\nin the present context, neural energy\u2014the internal energies in\nneurons (see Banks 2014,149, 203). Manifesting itself qualitatively at\nthe level of the single neuron, this energy may yield an electrical\ndischarge event; but manifesting itself at the level of a complex\nbrain event\u2014an event that is \u201csomehow\n\u2018composed\u2019 of neurons firing in some kind of\ncluster\u201d (Banks 2014: 147)\u2014this very same neural energy\nmay yield the event that is a sensation of blue. This closes the\napparent chasm between the experience of blue and the firing of a\nbunch of neurons:\n\nthe quality blue and the individual electrical discharges are just\ndifferent and mutually exclusive manifestations of the same natural\npowers which we mistakenly see as belonging to totally different\ncategories of event. (Banks 2014: 164)\n\n\nThis is an attractive picture, but it is difficult to see it as a\nmonism of neutral events. Wherein does the neutrality of these\nevents\u2014an experience of blue and neural firing\nevents\u2014consist? Moreover, it is not obvious that events (whether\nneutral or not) play a fundamental ontological role. In their place we\nfind the powers/energies that give rise to events.\n\nBanks addresses this second problem head on: Powers are identical with\ntheir token manifestations, identical with the events that consist in\nthe individual qualities wherein these powers manifest themselves (see\nBanks 2014:\n 149).[25]\n There is no separate, more fundamental level of reality underlying\nthe events. The powers just are the events. The neural energy\nis identical with the event that is the electrical discharging of a\ngroup of neurons; this same neural energy is also identical with the\nevent that is a sensation of blue. But, and this is a crucial part of\nBanks\u2019s view, the discharge events are not identical with the\nblue sensation. Banks sees the question that this poses clearly:\n\nhow can it be the case that the powers are identical with each of\ntheir token manifestations and even identical qua powers across\ndifferent token manifestation events, but that different token\nmanifestation events are not identical to each other? (Banks 2014:\n149)\n\n\nThis is not an easy knot to unravel. Perhaps an appeal to the\ncontroversial notion of \u201crelative identity\u201d might help.\n\nAssuming that the fundamentality of events has been established, we\nstill face the question in which sense they qualify as neutral.\nConsider\n\nthe event of seeing a blue patch and the event of having all the\nconfigured neurons fire in the region of the brain\nresponsible for seeing the blue patch. (Banks 2014: 164)\n\n\nTo the na\u00efve opinion that the first of these events is mental,\nwhile the second is physical, Banks replies as follows:\n\nThe phenomenon of sensation simply falls into place as a certain type\nof physical event among others in nature. The separate category of\nmental phenomena simply ceases to exist, except as a provisional way\nof talking. (Banks 2014: 164)\n\n\nThe monism expressed in this answer is beyond reasonable doubt; but\nthe neutrality is somewhat elusive.\n",
