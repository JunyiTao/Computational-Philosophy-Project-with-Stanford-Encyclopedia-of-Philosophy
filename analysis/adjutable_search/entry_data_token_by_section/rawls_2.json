    "main_text": "Aims and Method || The Sequence of Theories\n2.2 The Sequence of Theories\n\nIn contrast to the utilitarian, for Rawls political philosophy is not\nsimply applied moral philosophy. The utilitarian holds to one\nuniversal moral principle (\u201cmaximize utility\u201d), which she\napplies to individual actions, political constitutions, international\nrelations, and all other subjects as required. Rawls has no universal\nprinciple: \u201cThe correct regulative principle for\nanything,\u201d he says, \u201cdepends on the nature of that\nthing\u201d (TJ, 29). Rawls confines his theorizing to the\npolitical domain, and within this domain he holds that the correct\nprinciples for each sub-domain depend on its particular agents and\nconstraints.\n\nRawls covers the domain of the political by addressing its sub-domains\nin sequence. The first sub-domain that he addresses is a\nself-contained democratic society reproducing itself across\ngenerations. Once principles are in place for such a society, Rawls\nmoves to a second sub-domain: a society of nations, of which this\ndemocratic society is a member. Rawls suggests (though he does not\nshow) that his sequence of theories could extend to cover further\nsub-domains, such as human interactions with animals. Universal\ncoverage will have been achieved once this sequence is complete, each\nsub-domain having received the principles appropriate to it.\n",
