    "main_text": "The Case for Immutability\n4. Arguments Against Immutability\n\n\nThere are many arguments against DDI. Al-Ghazali (The Incoherence of\nthe Philosophers, XIII) originated one that was re-invented by Norman\nKretzmann (1966).  We can put a version of it this way:\n\nIf God is omniscient, God knows what time it is now. \n What time it is now is constantly changing.  So\nWhat God knows is constantly changing. (First He knows that it is\nnow t and not now t+1, later He knows that it is now t+1\nand not now t.)  So\nGod is constantly changing. \n\n(2) assumes that presentness is a metaphysically privileged status,\nand what events, times or states of affairs have it is constantly\nshifting: following current jargon, let us call views of time which\nhold this A-theories.  Kretzmann and others who push the argument\nspeak as if there were also a unique universal present, but this is\ninessential: if due to relativity we were to say that there are\ndifferent nows in different places, an omniscient God would have to\nknow what time it is now at all of them.  Some responses to the\nargument deny this assumption: Helm (1988), for instance, suggests\nthat all temporal truths can be expressed by wholly tenseless\npropositions, though he also notes that if one finds this\nunacceptable, he would be content with the claim that for every tensed\nproposition there is a tenseless one that reports the same fact.\n(3) assumes that one knows that p only if one can truly\ntoken \u201cp\u201d to oneself. Aquinas seems to have\nquestioned this.  He reports \u201cancient nominalists\u201d as\ndealing with (1)\u2013(4) by denying (3) \u2014 they claimed that\nwhat God knows is simply an event, the nativity of Christ, and so the\nsentences \u201cChrist was born\u201d and \u201cChrist will be\nborn\u201d signify the same thing, since they signify the same event\n(ST Ia 14, 15 ad 3), and therefore the objects of divine knowledge\nthese sentences express do not differ.  Aquinas objects that the\ndifferences in the sentences cause them to express different\npropositions, and so concedes that it is not true that whatever\nproposition ever expresses what God knows, always expresses what God\nknows.  This, however, does not mean that God's knowledge itself\nchanges, Thomas adds, because He does not know what He knows by\naffirming propositions (ibid.). Rather, His knowledge is a timeless\nintuition which shows that propositions are at one time true and\nanother false (ibid. et De Ver. 2, 5 ad 11; for commentary see\nSullivan 1991). Aquinas, then, might simply deny the tokening\nrequirement, and so (3): he may object not to the nominalist move, but\nto how they get there.\n Hector-Neri Casta\u00f1eda replied to Kretzmann by way of the claim that\n\n P. If x knows that y knows that p, x\n knows that p (1967, 207).\n\n(P) is plausible.  If x knows that y knows that\np, x knows that p is true, since knowledge\nentails truth.  But plausibly, if x knows that p is\ntrue, x knows that p. Suppose, then, that our immutable\nbeing is an atemporal God, seeing time from without. God knows that\nSmith, at t, knows that it is now t.  God knows that\nJones, at t+1, knows that it is now t+1.  By (P), God\natemporally knows both propositions, without having to change \u2014\nthough if we impose the tokening requirement, we have to add that He\ncan token them to Himself only through other sentences than \u201cit\nis now t\u201d and \u201cit is now t+1\u201d: for an\natemporal being cannot truly token either. Swinburne objects: (P) does\nnot just (say) predicate properties of an individual, but presents the\nindividual to x a particular way, and y does not know\nwhat x does unless what y tokens to y presents\nthat individual to y the same way what x tokens to\nx presents it to x (1993, 170\u20131).  However, this reply\nmay equivocate on \u201cwhat y knows.\u201d It is one thing for\nx and y to know the same proposition, and another,\nperhaps, for the proposition to have the same overall cognitive\nsignificance for x and y. A mode of presentation might\naffect overall significance without providing further information that\nmight be stated in a further proposition.  Still, (P) is in fact\nfalse.  If God tells me that He knows the date of the Second Coming, I\nknow that God knows it: He cannot lie, and I know that He is\nomniscient anyway.  But I still do not know the day nor the hour.\n Edward Wierenga (1989, 175\u201390) offered two replies to the\nargument, based on differing accounts of what propositions are\nbelieved and the requirements of omniscience.  On the first, an\nomniscient being would know all truths, propositions expressed by\npresent-tensed sentences predicate properties of whatever time has a\ntime-haecceity T, but they and all other propositions are\neternally true.  Knowers in time have access to the time\nwith T, and perhaps T itself, only at that time: so what\nchanges over time is not what is true, but what temporal believers\nhave access to.  But (Wierenga notes) there is no reason to think that\nan atemporal believer would suffer similar access limits. (After all,\nplausibly it is being in time that imposes them.) So on this account\nthere is no bar to holding that an atemporal believer timelessly knows\nthe same truths temporal believers know only at some times.  In\neffect, Wierenga denies that (2) implies (3): if all truths are\neternally true, what is true does not change. Kvanvig 1986 had made a\nbroadly similar move.\n\nWilliam Craig has argued that this move is incompatible with an\nA-theory of time (2001, 119\u201323). In a sense Wierenga need not\ncare.  He was not aiming to show that omniscience, immutability and an\nA-theory are compatible, but only that omniscience and immutability\nare compatible.  If the conjunction of omniscience, immutability and a\nB-theory is consistent, its members are pairwise consistent, for if\nthere were a contradiction between any two conjuncts, the whole\nconjunction would ipso facto be inconsistent. But in any case, Craig's\ncharge misfires.  This first move is compatible with real passage.\nThe first move entails only that if time passes, passage is not\nrepresented by first one thing and then another being true.  Passage\nis instead represented by something within the overall set of eternal\ntruths- perhaps something as simple as an assertion that time passes,\nor even that each time, when present, is all there is to temporal\nreality.  Passage can also appear in our story as what explains change\nin what we have access to and perhaps in the overall cognitive import\nof our belief-states.  Wierenga's view can allow that the times he\nspeaks of are A-theoretic, existing only when present.  The view\nrequires not that times be tenselessly there but that their\nhaecceities be always and atemporally available.\n\nOn Wierenga's second move, there is no such thing as truth\nsimpliciter. Rather, all truth is truth at a perspective (a pair\n<S, t> of a person and a time).  If I am sitting\nnow but was not sitting at midnight, the second move does not say that\nthe proposition <I am sitting> first was not true and then was.\nRather, it says that <I am sitting> is true at <me, now>\nbut was false at <me, midnight>. Given this machinery, Wierenga\ndefines omniscience this way: x is omniscient just if for all\npropositions p and perspectives <S, t>,\nif p is true at <S, t>, x knows\nthis, and if x is at <S, t> and p is\ntrue at <S, t>, x knows that p. With\nthese moves, it's easy to show that atemporal (and so immutable)\nomniscience is possible if there can be such a thing as an atemporal\nperspective. If so, those pushing (1)\u2013(4) can rule out immutable\nomniscience only if they can provide independent reason to think that\nnecessarily, all perspectives are temporal.  If they have that, of\ncourse, they do not need (1)\u2013(4), because if God is temporal and\npersists, His perspective changes and so what He must know to be\nomniscient changes. Thus (1)\u2013(4) turns out dialectically\nimpotent and otiose.\nCraig claims that recourse to truth-at-a-perspective is\nincompatible with an A-theory (2004, 107). This is so, he thinks,\nbecause propositions true at t must be true simpliciter\nwhen t is the unique objective present. But why think so? Here\nis another A-theoretic view: when t is the unique objective\npresent, all temporal perspectives that actually exist\ninclude t, truths indexed to t are true at all actually\nexisting perspectives, but there is no such thing as truth\nsimpliciter. Unless there is some hidden inconsistency here,\nA-theories do not require truth simpliciter.  Craig claims that\nWierenga's second move too is incompatible with an A-theory (2001,\n2004). But on this move, omniscience does not require that\nperspectives be tenselessly there.  It requires that propositions\nabout them be always and perhaps atemporally available, which one can\nassure by taking \u201ct\u201d as shorthand for \u201csome time with\nhaecceity T\u201d and letting haecceities exist necessarily.\nThe second move works given an A-theory, but has a consequence\nA-theorists may not like. Suppose that time really passes: indeed,\nsuppose presentism, on which only the fleeting present is real.  Then\nfirst <it is now t> is true at those temporal\nperspectives that include t (on presentism, there are no\nothers) and then it is false at all perspectives (on presentism,\nsince t is now past, there are only temporal perspectives in\nwhich it is false).  But at an atemporal perspective, it is never true\nthat it is now t, for any t.  There is no time it is in\neternity; if there were, eternality would not be an atemporal mode of\nbeing.  So at an atemporal perspective, time simply does not pass,\nthere is nothing about passage to know, and this is why passage poses\nno problem for immutable omniscience. Passage is real in time, then,\nbut not at an atemporal perspective.  Requiring an atemporal being to\nknow that it is now noon to count as omniscient is like requiring\nsomeone at midnight to know that it is now noon to count as\nomniscient: what is not true at one's perspective is not knowable then\neither.\nOf course, one wants to know how to make sense of the idea that\npassage is real only in time. Stump and Kretzmann (1981) gave a take\non this while retracting Kretzmann's original commitment to\n(1)\u2013(4).  Suppose presentism.  On the Stump-Kretzmann picture,\neach time t, when present, is \u201cET-simultaneous\u201d with the life of an\neternal being.  So that life is ET-simultaneous with t. So all times,\nprecisely in their presentness, are just ET-simultaneous with an\neternal life. But in an eternal life, nothing passes.  If it did, that\nlife would have earlier and later parts: it would be temporal, not\neternal.  So in God's eternal life, each time, precisely in its\npresentness, remains: nothing ever ceases to be ET-simultaneous with\nGod's life, for that would entail an earlier and a later simultaneous\nto God's life, and so in God's life.  So while times pass in time,\nthey do not pass relative to eternity.  Leftow (1991) offers a broadly\nsimilar picture, but works with a differently-defined\nsimultaneity-relation.\n\nKretzmann's argument is simply that an omniscient being must be\n\u201csubject to change\u201d (1966, 410): he does not sort changes as intrinsic\nand extrinsic.  One of his examples of change induced by a change in\nwhat is known is clearly an extrinsic change (1966, 411).\n\n\nSo one reply is that knowing the correct time is not an intrinsic\nstate of God's, and so change with respect to it would not contradict\nDDI. Intrinsic states are those settled entirely within one's own\nskin. But then unless p is a truth entirely about matters\nwithin one's own skin, knowing that p is not an intrinsic\nstate. For that one knows that p rather than believes falsely\nthat p only if p is true, and if p is not a\ntruth entirely about matters within one's own skin, whether p\nis true is at least partly settled by matters outside one's own skin.\nBut when it is now is not a matter settled within God's own skin. What\ntime it is now is not a fact about God alone. It is a fact about time,\nwhich is not God, and also about the entire temporal\nuniverse. Further, it arguably is not the case even that what is\nwithin God's skin settles what time it is in the sense that were\nnothing else than God to exist, facts about God would suffice to\ndetermine what time it is. For this would be at best a contentious\nclaim, as it implies that God would be in time if he existed alone,\nwithout a universe. Many would say that time is an aspect of the\nphysical universe \u2014 no universe, no time either. Moreover, even\nif God existed alone and were then in time, knowing what time it is\nwould not be a temporally intrinsic matter. God knows that it\nis now t just at t. So knowing the correct time\nat t is temporally intrinsic only if it does not entail the\nexistence or occurrence of anything that exists at other times. But\nfor any time after the first instant (if there was one), knowing what\ntime it is involves knowing the temporal distance between the present\ntime and some other time: knowing that it is noon, April 16, 2002,\nimplies knowing a relation between that time and date and the date\ntraditionally assigned to the birth of Christ. Thus knowing what time\nit is entails knowing that there was some time other than the present\n\u2014 a time outside the period in which God knows that it is now\nthis time. Knowing what time it is at any time after the first instant\nthus is not a temporally intrinsic state. And if this is so, it is\nhard to see why even knowledge that it is time's first instant would\nbe. Thus the objection has a false premise. If God's cognitive state\nwith respect to what time it is changed, it would not follow from this\nthat he is not intrinsically immutable. This result may seem\na bit hard to swallow. One wants to know how a change in\nknowledge could fail to be an intrinsic change. One answer might\nappeal to externalist theories of mental content. On these, my\nknowledge that p is a complex consisting of my inner mental\nstate plus certain items in the world. Perhaps God's knowledge that it\nis now t is something like a complex consisting of God's\ninner cognitive state and an external component, t. If it is,\nperhaps the only change involved when God first knows that it is now\nt and then knows that it is now t* (> t)\nis the change from t to t*.\n\n\nOther arguments against DDI appeal to Scripture's depiction of God\nas changing, e.g., in the Flood story. Facing such texts, DDI's friends\ndefuse the appearance of divine change by appeal to doctrines less\nspeculative and theoretical than DDI. Thus Philo argues from God's\nforeknowledge of the future and constancy of character that God cannot\nrepent or feel regret, as the Flood story suggests. The Incarnation is\nan especially knotty problem for DDI's Christian friends. In general,\nthese argue that all change it involved occurred in the human nature\nGod the Son assumed rather than in God; God was eternally ready to be\nincarnate, and eternally had those experiences of the earthly Christ\nwhich the Incarnation makes part of his life. Through changes in Mary\nand the infant she bore, what was eternally in God eventually took\nplace on earth.\n\n\nAnother argument against DDI appeals to God's power. Before\nCreation, God could assure that no universe ever existed. God has this\npower now only if he can alter the past. Few think he can. So events\nseem to change God's power. DDI's defenders reply that any change here\nis purely extrinsic. God has the power he always has. He has lost a\nchance to use it, and so we no longer want to call his power a\npower to prevent a universe. But God is intrinsically as able as ever\nto do so.\nSwinburne has argued that immutability is incompatible with acting\nfreely, writing that an \u201cagent is perfectly free at a certain time if\nhis action results from his own choice at that time and if his choice\nis not itself brought about by anything else.  Yet a person immutable\nin the strong sense would be unable to perform any action at a certain\ntime other than what he had previously intended to do.  His course of\naction being fixed by his past choices, he would not be perfectly\nfree\u201d (1993, p. 222).  One thing to note here is that if my past\nchoices fix my present choice, it does not follow that they bring it\nabout.  It may only follow that it is inevitable that I myself bring\nthat choice about at that time.  So it is not at all clear that\nimmutability is incompatible even with Swinburnean perfect freedom.\nMore importantly, Swinburne's \u201cperfect freedom\u201d is a particularly\ndemanding notion.  Even if my own past choices do bring about my\npresent choice, many libertarians would allow that my present choice\nis derivatively free and responsible if the past choices that brought\nit about were libertarian-free (see e.g. Kane 1996, Stump 1996,\nEkstrom 2000).  Most theists would be quite content with a God with\nfull libertarian freedom.\n\n\nA final objection goes thus: God does change extrinsically. Even\nfull DDI grants this. But whatever changes extrinsically is in time.\nFor different things are true of it at different times, even if the\n\u2018real\u2019 changes due to which this is so are in other things.\nAnd whatever is in time changes intrinsically \u2014 it grows older. So DDI\nis false. Some would reply by denying that growing older is an\nintrinsic change. A more controversial response might be to deny even\nextrinsic change to God. This can be done by holding that God is\natemporal. For if God exists at t and at a later t*,\nand, at t, p is true of him and, at t*,\np is false of him, he does change extrinsically. He bears\ndifferent relations to proposition p, at least. If God is\natemporal, he exists neither at t nor at t* \u2014 his\nexistence is not temporally located. If this is so, there are never two\ntimes such that different things are true of him at different times.\nRather, all that is ever true of him is true of him timelessly. But a\nthing changes, even extrinsically, only if different things are true of\nit at different times. Perhaps, then, defending DDI requires commitment\nto divine timelessness.\n",
