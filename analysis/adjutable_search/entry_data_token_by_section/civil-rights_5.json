    "main_text": "Categories of Rights || Cultural Rights\n3.3 Cultural Rights\n\nCultural rights include language rights for members of cultural\nminorities and the rights of indigenous peoples to preserve their\ncultural institutions and practices and to exercise some measure of\npolitical autonomy. Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights declares that such rights ought to be protected:\n\u201cIn those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities\nexist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the\nright, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy\ntheir own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, or to\nuse their own language.\u201d Similarly, the Canadian Charter of Rights and\nFreedoms protects the language rights of minorities, and section 27\nprovides, \u201cThis Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent\nwith the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of\nCanadians.\u201d In the United States, the Voting Rights Act protects the\nspeakers of certain minority languages (52 U.S.C. \u00a710303), and\nconstitutional doctrine recognizes native Indian tribes as having some\nrights of political self-rule.\n\nThere is substantial philosophical controversy over the legitimacy and\nscope of rights of cultural membership. Kymlicka has argued that the\nliberal commitment to protect the equal rights of individuals requires\nsociety to protect such rights, suitably defined (1989; 1994; 1995).\nHe distinguishes among three sorts of rights that have been claimed by\nvarious groups whose culture differs from the dominant culture of a\ncountry: (1) rights of self-government, involving a claim to a degree\nof political autonomy to be exercised through the minority\nculture\u2019s own institutions, (2) polyethnic rights, involving\nspecial claims by members of the minority culture to facilitate their\nintegration into mainstream institutions and practices, and (3)\nrepresentational rights, involving a special claim of the minority\nculture to have its members serve in legislatures and other political\nbodies of the broader society (1995: 27\u201333). \n\nKymlicka argues that these three sorts of group rights can, in\nprinciple, be justified for those populations that he designates as\n\u201cnational minorities,\u201d such as native Americans in the\nUnited States and the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Aboriginals in\nCanada. A national minority is \u201can intergenerational community,\nmore or less institutionally complete, occupying a given territory or\nhomeland, [and] sharing a distinct language and history\u201d (18).\nKymlicka contends that \u201cgranting special representational\nrights, land claims, or language rights to a [national] minority\n\u2026 can be seen as putting \u2026 [it] on a more equal footing\n[with the majority], by reducing the extent to which the smaller group\nis vulnerable to the larger\u201d (36\u201337). Such special rights\ndo not involve granting to the national minority the authority to take\naway any of the civil rights of its members. Rather, the rights are\n\u201cexternal protections,\u201d providing the group with powers and\nimmunities with which it can protect its culture against the\npotentially harmful decisions of the broader society (35).\n\nAccording to Kymlicka, in contrast to national minorities (and\nrefugees), most immigrants have left their original cultures\nvoluntarily and so are entitled only to a much more limited set of\ngroup rights. These \u201cpolyethnic rights\u201d are claims to have\ncertain adjustments or accommodations made in the prevailing laws and\nregulations so as to give individuals access to the social mainstream.\nThus, Kymlicka thinks that Orthodox Jews in the U.S. Armed Forces\nshould have the legal right to wear a yarmulke while on duty and\nCanadian Sikhs have a legitimate claim to be exempt from motorcycle\nhelmet laws (31).\n\nKymlicka\u2019s distinction between national minorities and\nimmigrants has been criticized by Choudhry, who writes that \u201cin\nthe majority of cases the decision to immigrate is not free\u201d\n(2002: 64) due to entrenched features of the global economy and other\nfactors beyond the control of immigrants. But Patten defends a\nqualified form of Kymlicka\u2019s distinction, arguing that, in light\nof the benefits received by immigrants and a moral prerogative that\nstates enjoy to pursue their own national projects, \u201ca modest\nprioritizing of the claims of national minorities over those of\nimmigrants is reasonable and permissible\u201d (2014: 295\u201396).\n\nHowever, Patten holds that Kymlicka\u2019s approach is deficient when\nit comes to cultural minorities \u2014 including immigrants\n\u2014who are geographically-dispersed and lack institutions that\ncould serve as the basis for their collective self-government.\nContra Kymlicka, Patten argues that, as a matter of justice,\nsuch persons have a right that their cultural practices enjoy a level\nof recognition and accommodation from the state that is equal to what\nthe majority culture enjoys. This right derives from a liberal\nstate\u2019s \u201cobligation to extend a fair opportunity for self-\ndetermination to all its citizens,\u201d (29) an obligation entailing\nthat the state \u201chas the responsibility to be neutral toward the\nvarious conceptions of the good that are affirmed by its\ncitizens\u201d (27). The appropriate form of neutrality (what Patten\ncalls \u201cneutrality of treatment\u201d) is achieved when the\nstate provides comparable facilities, resources, and opportunities to\nthe members of cultural minority groups so that they are neither\ndisadvantaged nor advantaged, relative to those in the cultural\nmajority, when it comes to pursuing identity-related aspects of their\nconceptions of the good. Patten explains identity-related features as\nones that are not simply preferences but help to define a\nperson\u2019s sense of who she is and hold a place of central\nimportance in a person\u2019s system of ends.\n\nAccording to Patten, among the areas in which a state might be called\nupon to extend special rights to cultural minorities are language,\nholidays, and the arrangement of substate political divisions. For\nexample, neutrality of treatment might require the state to supply its\nservices, such as assistance with tax preparations or information\nregarding health matters, in the languages of cultural minorities.\nAlthough such accommodations would go well beyond what Kymlicka has\nendorsed, Patten agrees with him that the underlying aim of cultural\nrights is not to ensure the survival of a culture. As Patten puts it,\nsuch rights \u201care not rights to cultural preservation\u201d\n(29). Once a framework of fair opportunity is established, whatever\ncultural outcome that emerges is just, even if some cultures\n\u201cstruggle or \u2026 disappear altogether\u201d (29).\n\nNotwithstanding their differences, the positions of Patten and\nKymlicka occupy a middle ground between views that are largely\nantagonistic to the idea of cultural rights and views that embrace\nsuch rights on the ground that the survival of cultures has an\nintrinsic importance, irreducible to the interests of individuals.\nBarry takes the former, antagonistic view, while Taylor takes the\nlatter.\n\nBarry asserts that \u201cthere are certain rights against oppression,\nexploitation, and injury, to which every single human being is\nentitled to lay claim, and \u2026 appeals to cultural diversity and\npluralism under no circumstances trump the value of basic liberal\nrights\u201d (2001: 132\u201333). The legal system should protect\nthose rights by impartially imposing the same rules on all persons,\nregardless of their cultural or religious membership. Barry allows for\na few exceptions, such as the accommodation of a Sikh boy whose turban\nviolated school dress regulations, but thinks that the conditions\nunder which such exceptions will be justified \u201care rarely\nsatisfied\u201d (2001: 62).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Taylor (1994) argues for a form of\ncommunitarianism that attaches intrinsic importance to the survival of\ncultures. In his view, differential treatment under the law for\ncertain practices is sometimes justifiable on the ground that such\ntreatment is important for keeping a culture alive. And Taylor\ncontends that cultural survival can sometimes override basic\nindividual rights, such as freedom of speech. Accordingly, he defends\nlegal restrictions on the use of English in Quebec, invoking the\nsurvival of Quebec\u2019s French culture.\n",
