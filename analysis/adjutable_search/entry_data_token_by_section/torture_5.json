    "main_text": "The Moral Justification for One-off Acts of Torture in Emergencies || Case Study \u2013 The Terrorist and the Ticking Bomb\n4. The Moral Justification for Legalised and Institutionalised Torture\n\nWe have seen that there are likely to exist, in the real world,\none-off emergency situations in which arguably torture is, all things\nconsidered, the morally best action to perform. It may seem to follow\nthat institutional arrangements should be in place to facilitate\ntorture in such situations. However, it is perfectly consistent to\nconcede that torture might be morally justifiable in certain one-off\nemergency situations and yet oppose any legalization or\ninstitutionalization of torture.\n\nLuban (2005) and (2014), and Waldron (2005), in particular, have drawn\nattention to the moral inconsistency and inherent danger in liberal\ndemocratic states legalising and institutionalising torture, a\npractice that strikes at the very heart of the fundamental liberal\nvalue of individual autonomy. They have also detailed the tendency for\na torture culture to develop in organisations in which torture is\nlegalised or tolerated, a culture in which the excesses of torturing\nthe innocent and the like take place, as in the US army detention\ncentres in Abu Ghraib in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and in the\nIsraeli secret service (General Security Service). Nevertheless, it is\nuseful to sketch a general argument against the legalisation and\ninstitutionalisation of torture. The argument is consistent with,\nindeed at some points it is more or less the same as, the arguments of\nLuban and Waldron. However, the argument has some novel elements, not\nthe least of which is the claim that the view that torture is morally\njustified in some extreme emergencies is compatible with the view that\ntorture ought not to be legalised and institutionalised.\n\nMost of the theorists who oppose the legalisation and\ninstitutionalisation of torture also (at least implicitly) reject the\npossibility, let alone actuality, of one-off emergencies in which\ntorture is morally justified. The argument has been put that there\nare, or could well be, such one-off extreme emergencies in which\ntorture is morally justified. So the first task here is to demonstrate\nthat these two claims are not inconsistent. Specifically, it needs to\nbe shown that it does not follow from the fact that torture is in some\nextreme emergencies morally justified, that torture ought to be\nlegalised, or otherwise institutionalised. So the claim is that it is\njust a mistake to assume that what morality requires or permits in a\ngiven situation must be identical with what the law requires or\npermits in that situation. This calls for some explanation.\n\nThe law in particular, and social institutions more generally, are\nblunt instruments. They are designed to deal with recurring situations\nconfronted by numerous institutional actors over relatively long\nperiods of time. Laws abstract away from differences between\nsituations across space and time, and differences between\ninstitutional actors across space and time. The law, therefore,\nconsists of a set of generalisations to which the particular situation\nmust be made to fit. Hence, if you exceed the speed limit you are\nliable for a fine, even though you were only 10 kph above the speed\nlimit, you have a superior car, you are a superior driver, there was\nno other traffic on the road, the road conditions were perfect, and\ntherefore the chances of you having an accident were actually less\nthan would be the case for most other people most of the time driving\nat or under the speed\n limit.[16]\n\nBy contrast with the law, morality is a sharp instrument. Morality can\nbe, and typically ought to be, made to apply to a given situation in\nall its particularity. (This is, of course, not to say that there are\nnot recurring moral situations in respect of which the same moral\njudgment should be made, nor is it to say that morality does not need\nto help itself to generalisations.) Accordingly, what might be, all\nthings considered, the morally best action for an agent to perform in\nsome one-off, i.e. non-recurring, situation might not be an action\nthat should be made lawful. Consider the real-life example of the five\nsailors on a raft in the middle of the ocean and without food. Four of\nthem decide to eat the fifth \u2013 the cabin boy \u2013 in order to\n survive.[17]\n This is a case of both murder and cannibalism. Was it morally\npermissible to kill and eat the boy, given the alternative was the\ndeath of all five sailors? Clearly it was not pro tanto morally\npermissible, especially given the cabin boy was entirely innocent; but\nperhaps it was morally permissible all things considered. And even if\nit was not morally permissible all things considered, nevertheless,\narguably it was morally excusable, and indeed the sailors, although\nconvicted of murder and cannibalism, had their sentence commuted in\nrecognition of this. But there was no suggestion that the laws against\nmurder and cannibalism admit of an exception in such an extreme case;\nthe sailors were convicted and sentenced for murder and cannibalism.\nAgain, consider an exceptionless law against desertion from the\nbattlefield in time of war. Perhaps a soldier is morally justified in\ndeserting his fellow soldiers, given that he learns of the more\nmorally pressing need for him to care for his wife who has contracted\nsome life-threatening disease back home. However, the law against\ndesertion will not, and should not, be changed to allow desertion in\nsuch cases.\n\nSome theorists (Allhoff 2012) have invoked the legal\nprinciple of necessity in order to establish that torture in some\nextreme circumstances is or should be legally permissible (Gaeta\n2004; Hunsinger 2008). However, the legal principle of necessity\nis inherently (and intentionally) vague. It typically applies to\nsituations in which someone has infringed a law, but done so to avert\na greater evil which is otherwise unavoidable. Here the notion of\ngreater evil is radically underspecified and, therefore, in need of\ninterpretation by the courts in any given case. Moreover, the\napplication of the principle of legal necessity in cases in which it\nis state operatives who invoke it, such as in cases of torture by the\nmembers of security agencies, is fraught with danger. For the\nprotection of the rights of citizens not to be tortured is likely to\nbe significantly reduced if there is a legal justification for torture\navailable to members of security agencies. Given the inherent\nvagueness of the notion of lesser evil, there is the potential in\ntheir adjudications for judges to favour the members of security\nagencies at the expense of ordinary citizens.\n\nWe will shortly turn to arguments to the effect that while there may\nwell be morally justifiable one-off cases of torturing the guilty, it\ndoes not follow that torture should ever be legalised, even in such\ncases. However, it has been suggested by Steinhoff (2010) and (2013)\nthat torturing the guilty can in many cases be understood as torturing\nthe guilty in self-defence. If so, presumably torturing the guilty\ncould reasonably be legalised on the grounds that torturing in\nself-defence is analogous to killing in self-defence, and self-defence\nis an explicit legal justification for killing in most jurisdictions.\nSteinhoff has also suggested (2006, 2013) that legalisation would not\nnecessarily lead to institutionalisation in the sense of the creation\nof the institutional role of a torturer, the routinisation and\nbureaucratisation of the process of torture, and so on.\n\nTorturing the guilty in self-defence is arguably something of a\nmisnomer. Firstly, it is not really self defence per se, but rather\nthe saving of the lives of others. After all, generally the would-be\ntorturer\u2019s life is not at risk, and even if it is at risk in a\nparticular location, as in some terrorist bombing scenarios, then\npresumably the risk can be averted by the torturer simply abandoning\nhis immobilised victim and fleeing the area. Note that on many\naccounts self defence is a more readily acceptable moral justification\nor excuse for killing an attacker than is defending the lives of\nothers (at least, others who are not members of one\u2019s family or\nclose friends). Secondly, torturing in order to save life is\ninherently unreliable by comparison with killing in self-defence. This\nis because killing an attacker is directly connected to the desired\noutcome of removing the threat; indeed, to kill the attacker is to\nremove the threat. This is not so with torture. Rather torturing is\none action and removing the threat (e.g., disarming the ticking bomb)\nis another act necessarily at some causal remove from the first\naction. Moreover, the putative (necessarily indirect) causal\nconnections between the two actions may well not obtain. Thirdly,\ntorturing the guilty to save innocent lives does not typically involve\nan imminent threat, as typically must be the case in instances of\nlawful self-defence in well-ordered jurisdictions. For the threat\nposed by (say) a terrorist-bomber is either imminent, as in the case\nof a suicide-bomber, in which case there is no time to torture anyone;\nor the threat is not imminent in which case there is time to pursue\nother options, such as intercepting the communications of other\nmembers of the terrorist cell and, thereby, locating the bomb. Again,\nconsider typical kidnapping cases. Either the kidnapper is not in\ncustody in which case he or she cannot be tortured; or the kidnapper\nis in custody in which case the threat to the kidnapped child from the\nkidnapper in custody is not imminent (the child is either dead or is\nalive and no longer under threat from the kidnapper in custody).\nNaturally, as we saw in the last section, there may well be a very\nsmall number of exceptional cases in which the threat is more or less\nimminent and torture is, nevertheless, a realistic option for removing\nthe threat (and, indeed, the only option). Accordingly, this small\nnumber of exceptional cases might be analogous to killing in\nself-defence. Moreover, in some torturing the guilty scenarios the all\nthings considered morally best option might be to torture the guilty\nparty; indeed the general argument for the latter proposition was\noutlined in the last section. However, this does not demonstrate that\njustified torturing of the guilty to save the innocent they threaten\nis essentially a species of justified self-defence and that,\ntherefore, it ought to be legalised.\n\nIt is consistent with the rejection of explicit legalisation of the\ntorturing of the guilty that, as noted above, there be some form of\nlegal redress in the very small number of exceptional cases of\ntorturing the guilty in which the threat to the innocent is imminent\n(and torture is morally justifiable all things considered). These\nforms of legal redress for the torturer might include the existence of\nmitigating circumstances or the application of the legal principle of\nnecessity \u2013 since the cases in question involve a genuinely\ndilemmatic situation in which the least harmful of the available\noptions was chosen and chosen to the advantage of the innocent rather\nthan the guilty.\n\nThe upshot of this discussion is that torturing the guilty to save the\nlives of the innocent is not analogous to killing in self-defence.\nSpecifically, the legalisation of torturing the guilty faces the\nproblem of imminence; unlike killing in self-defence it almost never\ninvolves an imminent threat. Accordingly, the legalisation of\ntorturing the guilty is likely to be regarded as extremely\nproblematic, since presumably legalisation is likely to result in\ninstitutionalisation. Consider in this connection police killing in\ndefence of the lives of innocent citizens. This involves the creation\nof the institutional role of police sniper with all its attendant\ntraining, development and implementation of procedures (including the\nrequirement that the threat be imminent before shots are fired) and,\nmore generally, bureaucratisation. This is, of course, not to say that\n(as argued above) certain one-off cases of torturing the guilty might\nnot be both morally justifiable and legally excusable (or otherwise be\nable to avail themselves of mitigating circumstances). \n\nAs already noted and contrary to the above-mentioned presumption,\nSteinhoff insists that legalization does not in fact necessarily lead\nto institutionalization. Specifically, he argues that the legalization\nof killing in self-defence has not led to its institutionalization,\nand he also claims (as we have seen) that torturing in self-defence is\nakin to killing in self-defence. As we have seen, the proposition that\ntorturing the guilty to save lives is analogous to killing in\nself-defence is open to question and there is surely at least a\npresumption that legalisation will lead to institutionalisation.\nHowever, there is a further more specific point to be made here in\nrelation to legalisation and institutionalisation. It is true that\nindividualistic killing in self-defence on the part of private\ncitizens has not led to institutionalization, but this is because it\nis an individual, non-institutional activity which is subject to\nstringent institutional accountability mechanisms (at least in\nwell-ordered liberal democratic states). But it is extremely doubtful\nthat an individual citizen is ever going to be in a situation where he\nhas to defend his life by torturing his attacker. What we are talking\nabout in this debate is the killing or torturing by institutional\nactors, e.g., police, of persons who are attacking third parties\n(whether by killing, kidnapping etc.); the third parties in question\nare, typically, members of the community. As noted above, the\nlegalized killing by police of third parties has been\ninstitutionalized (police snipers). So evidently killing in\nself-defence does not constitute a relevant case in which there is\nlegalization but not institutionalization.\n\nWhether or not torture is likely to be institutionalised once\nlegalised, or is even likely to be institutionalised if not actively\nresisted on an ongoing basis, is partly a matter of the\nmotivational drivers in play. And unfortunately, even in liberal\ndemocracies, when the threat to the community is regarded as\nsubstantial, institutional actors (such as police and military\npersonnel) have been willing to engage in routinised extra-judicial\nkilling (India, today) and more than willing to engage in routinised\ntorture (use of the third degree by police agencies world-wide). In\ndoing so, they have typically appealed to a self-defence moral\njustification (\u2018We had to torture/kill in order to save\nlives\u2019). Moreover, in the case of the extra-judicial killings\nthey have typically helped themselves to and often been aided by the\nlegal justification of self-defence \u2013 \u2018the Naxalites (in\nIndia) shot at us first and we fired back in self-defence\u2019\n(albeit what has also been revealed over time is a culture of\n\u2018shoot first and ask questions later\u2019). Torture is much\nmore prevalent than killing in part because (as Steinhoff argues)\ntorture is rightly regarded as not necessarily as bad as killing\n(criminals tortured by police are typically able to carry on with\ntheir lives, even if in prison) and perhaps also in part because\ntorture is less susceptible to the available accountability measures\n(you cannot hide corpses, at least in liberal democracies). In short,\nthere is good reason to believe that legalizing torture in contexts in\nwhich there is a substantial threat to the community will lead to its\ninstitutionalization.\n\nIt has been noted on a number of occasions that the law and morality\ncan and do come apart. Moreover, it is plausible that sometimes they\nought to come apart. A further point to be elaborated here\npertains to the nature of the sub-institution of torture within the\nlarger military, police, and correctional institutions. There is a\nneed to begin with a few preliminary remarks about social\n institutions.[18]\n\nSocial institutions, including legal institutions and military,\npolice, and correctional organisations, have both a massive collective\ninertia and a massive collective momentum by virtue of the\nparticipation in them of many agents over a long time who: (a) pursue\nthe same goals; (b) occupy the same roles and, therefore, perform the\nsame tasks and follow the same rules and procedures, and; (c) share\nthe same culture. Accordingly, social institutions and their component\norganisations are like very large ocean liners that cannot slow down,\nspeed up, or change direction very easily. It follows that very\ncareful thought needs to be given to the establishment of any\nadditional structure of roles and associated practices that is to be\nwoven into the fabric of the institution. For such an additional\n(embodied) role structure, once it becomes, so to speak, an integrated\nworking part of the larger institution, is likely to be extremely\ndifficult to remove; it is now a beneficiary of the inertia of the\ninstitution. Moreover such an additional, but now integrated, role\nstructure participates in, and influences the direction of, the\ninstitution; it is now a contributing element to the momentum of the\ninstitution.\n\nSo what can be said of the likely institutional fit between military,\npolice, and correctional institutions on the one hand, and the\nsub-institution of torture on the other? The role structure of this\nsub-institution consists of torturers, torturer trainers, medical\npersonnel who assist torturers, and the like. The core practice of\ntorture has been described in an earlier section.\n\nThe practice of torture is endemic in many, perhaps most, military,\npolice, and correctional institutions in the world today, including\ndemocracies such as India. It is only in recent times and with great\ndifficulty that torture in Australian prisons and police services, for\nexample, has been largely eliminated, or at least very significantly\nreduced. The Australian, British, American, and like cases are\nimportant not only because they illustrate that torture can be endemic\nto liberal democratic institutions, but also because they demonstrate\nthat liberal democratic institutions are able \u2013 given the\npolitical will, suitable re-education and training, stringent\naccountability mechanisms, etc. \u2013 to successfully combat a culture\nof torture.\n\nLet us look at some of the evidence from the past. Consider police\norganisations in liberal democracies such as the USA. The influential\nReport on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement from the National\nCommission on Law Observance and Enforcement, also know as the\nWickersham Commission, in 1931 found that the use of the third degree\nwas widespread throughout police organisations in the USA (National\nCommission on Law Observance and Enforcement 1931, 4). More recently,\nwe have the Rampart Reports documenting extensive police\nbrutality \u2013 including extra-judicial killings (Parks 2000,\n87\u2013109; Rampart Independent Review Panel 2000, 11\u201314)\n \u2013 and, in the wake of the Rodney King beating, the report of the\n\u201cChristopher Commission\u201d into the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment which found that a significant number of LAPD officers\n\u201crepetitively use excessive force against the public and\npersistently ignore the written guidelines of the Department regarding\nforce\u201d (Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment 1991, 9\u201312). In India \u2013 another liberal\ndemocratic state, albeit one at an earlier stage of economic\ndevelopment \u2013 police brutality is institutionalised. According to\na recent Human Rights Watch Report (Human Rights Watch 2009: 14),\n\u201cpolice violence and misconduct are \u2026 widespread and\nrooted in institutional practice\u201d. Arvind Verma, an authority on\npolicing in India, states that \u201cMisuse of force, false-encounter\nkillings (execution by police) and routine use of torture in extorting\nconfessions are common with the police departments\u201d (Verma 2011:\n5).\n\nNow consider prisons in liberal democracies. In the USA in the past\nwidespread beatings and torture of prisoners (e.g., use of electrodes\non prisoners\u2019 private parts) has been documented in multiple\njurisdictions, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia\nand Florida. See, for example, Murton and Hyams\u2019 classic work,\nInside Prison, USA (Murton and Hyams 1969). In Australia\nthere was the Nagle Royal Commission into New South Wales Prisons.\nNagle reported systematic bashings in NSW prisons. He said of Grafton\nGaol, in particular, that it had a \u201cregime of terror\u201d,\n\u201c\u2026brutal, savage and sometimes sadistic\u201d (Nagle\n1978: 108). He concluded thus: \u201cIt is the view of the Commission\nthat every prison officer who served at Grafton during the time it was\nused as a gaol for intractables must have known of its brutal regime.\nThe majority of them, if not all, would have taken part in the illegal\nassaults on prisoners\u201d (Nagle 1978: 119).\n\nWhen it comes to authoritarian regimes matters are, of course, much\nworse. Let us set aside the infamous Soviet Gulags under Stalin and\nalso Hitler\u2019s concentration camps, and rather consider some more\nrecent examples. The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission\nstated that under the apartheid regime, \u201ctorture was used\nsystematically by the Security Branch, both as a means of obtaining\ninformation and of terrorising detainees and activists. Torture was\nnot confined to particular police stations, particular regions or\nparticular individual police officers\u201d (TRC 1998: 187). In Chile\nthe National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR 1993: 1122)\ndetailed over 2000 victims of human rights violations by the security\nforces of the Pinochet regime of which victims approximately half were\nkilled (hundreds tortured to death) and the remaining half disappeared\nafter arrest. According to Juan Mendez (a UN Special Advisor who was\nhimself tortured during the Argentinean military dictatorship):\n\u201cTorture became systematic and pervasive during the military\ndictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s, but it would be a mistake to\ntrace its origins only as far as this dark era. In fact, torture was\nused by dictatorial as well as elected but authoritarian governments\nthroughout the twentieth century\u201d (Mendez 2005: 56).\n\nIn the light of the evidence it would be a massive understatement to\nsay that historically the sub-institution of torture \u2013 whether in\na lawful or unlawful form \u2013 has been no stranger to military,\npolice, and correctional institutions. Further, there is now a great\ndeal of empirical evidence that in institutional environments in which\ntorture is routinely practised it has a massive impact on other\npractices and on moral attitudes. For example, in police organisations\nin which torture is routinely used the quality of investigations and,\nin particular, of interviewing of suspects, tends to be low. Careful,\nlogically based, questioning on the basis of the available evidence is\nreplaced by beating up suspects. Thus lower echelon police\ninvestigators in India often have little or no training in best\npractice interviewing and (as noted above) they routinely use the\nthird degree. Again, Baldwin\u2019s findings based on hundreds of\ntaped interviews indicate that the interviewing skills of UK police\nduring the period of the infamous police use of the third degree\nagainst the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four and Maguire Seven would\nhave been quite poor (Baldwin 1993). Police in organisations in which\noffenders are routinely tortured do not, unsurprisingly, tend to\ndevelop respect for the moral rights of offenders, suspects, or even\nwitnesses. This is entirely consistent with the excesses detailed by\nLuban and Waldron in the US military detention centres in Iraq and\nelsewhere, e.g., the Abu Ghraib scandal, and in the case of the\ninterrogations of suspected terrorists by the Israeli secret service.\nIndeed, these excesses are to be expected.\n\nAnd there is this further point. The prevalence of torture in numerous\nmilitary, police, and correctional institutions throughout the world\nhas taken place notwithstanding that for the most part it has been\nboth unlawful and opposed by the citizenry.\n\nIt is to be concluded from all this that for the most part military,\npolice, and correctional institutions are qua institutions\nvery receptive to the practice of torture \u2013 even when it is\nunlawful \u2013 and that these institutions qua institutions\nwould relatively easily incorporate the legalised sub-institution of\ntorture; accordingly, it is very easy to legalise torture and thereby\ngrow and develop a torture culture in military, police and\ncorrectional institutions. This does not mean that there are not\nimportant differences between, say, police services in authoritarian\nstates and those in contemporary (though not necessarily historical)\nliberal democratic states; obviously there are. Nor does it mean that\nmost, or even the majority, of the individuals who occupy roles in\nthese institutions, whether in liberal democracies or elsewhere, are\nnecessarily receptive qua individuals to engaging in the\npractice of torture; most of them might not be. However, most of them\nwould not be torturing people; that would be done by a distinct\nminority, as in fact has usually been the case even in institutions in\nwhich torture is unlawful and endemic. The question is whether or not\nas individuals they would initially tolerate, and finally accept, the\npractice of torture, if it were legally and institutionally\nestablished; the suggestion is that the historical and comparative\nevidence is that they would, including in liberal democracies.\n\nA additional conclusion to be drawn is that should the legalised\nsub-institution of torture be integrated into any of these\ninstitutions it would be very difficult to remove and would, even in\nliberal democracies, have a major impact on the direction, culture,\nand practices of these institutions. Again, this is what the\nhistorical and comparative empirical evidence tells, notwithstanding\nthe initial and even continuing aversion of many, perhaps most, of the\nindividuals in these institutions to torture as such. Consider the\nIsraeli case. Limited forms of torture were legal in Israel prior to\n1999, but illegal post 1999. However, evidently torture has by no\nmeans been eradicated post 1999. According to the Public Committee\nAgainst Torture in Israel (PCATI), reporting on the period between\nSeptember 2001 and April 2003: \u201cThe affidavits and testimonies\ntaken by attorneys and fieldworkers\u2026 support the conclusions\n\u2026violence, painful tying, humiliations and many other forms of\nill-treatment, including detention under inhuman conditions, are a\nmatter of course\u2026.The bodies which are supposed to keep the GSS\n[General Security Service] under scrutiny and ensure that\ninterrogations are conducted lawfully act, instead, as rubberstamps\nfor decisions by the GSS\u2026The State Prosecutor\u2019s Office\ntransfers the interrogees\u2019 complaints to a GSS agent for\ninvestigation and it is little wonder that it has not found in even a\nsingle case that GSS agents tortured a Palestinian\n\u2018unnecessarily\u2019\u201d (PCATI 2003).\n\nThe deeper explanation for the prevalence of torture cultures and the\ndifficulty of eradicating institutionalised torture is no doubt very\ncomplex, but presumably it consists in part in the following elements:\n(1) moral docility, as opposed to physical docility, is a feature of\nindividuals housed in, and materially dependent upon, large,\nhierarchical, bureaucratic organisations with strong, relatively\nhomogenous cultures; (2) the roles of soldier, police officer, and\nprison warder necessarily involve the routine use of coercive, and\neven deadly, force against dangerous criminals, enemy soldiers, or\nterrorists, and therefore undertaking these roles inevitably results\nin a degree of moral de-sensitisation and a sense of moral ambiguity\nwhen it comes to torturing criminals and/or terrorists; (3) torture is\nan exercise of enormous power, and power is deeply seductive to many\npeople (and much less dangerous than shooting at armed enemy\ncombatants or trying to arrest or subdue violent criminals).\n\nArmed with these observations on the difference between law and\nmorality, and on the nature of the sub-institution of torture in\nmilitary, police, and correctional institutions, what now can be said\non the question as to whether or not to legalise and institutionalise\ntorture in contemporary well-ordered liberal democratic states\nundergoing a lengthy period of attacks from terrorist\norganisations?\n\nAs we saw above, torture is a terrorist tactic. Indeed, arguably it is\nthe terrorist tactic par excellence. Detonating bombs that\nkill the innocent has come to be regarded as the quintessential\nterrorist tactic. But this is presumably because terrorism has\nimplausibly come to be identified only with non-state terrorism. At\nany rate, the point to be made here is that torture is a terrorist\ntactic, and for a liberal democracy to legalise and institutionalise\nit, i.e. weave the practice of torture into the very fabric of liberal\ndemocratic institutions, would be both an inherent\ncontradiction \u2013 torture being an extreme assault on individual\nautonomy \u2013 and, given what we know about the practice of torture\nin military, police, and correctional institutions, highly damaging to\nthose liberal democratic institutions. It would be equivalent to a\nliberal democracy legalising and institutionalising slavery on the\ngrounds, say, of economic necessity. Legalised and institutionalised\nslavery is inconsistent with liberal democracy, as is legalised and\ninstitutionalised torture. So if legalised and institutionalised\nslavery and/or legalised and institutionalised torture are necessary\nbecause morally required, then liberal democracy is not possible in\nanything other than an attenuated form. But of course neither\nlegalised/institutionalised slavery nor legalised/institutionalised\ntorture is morally required, quite the contrary. At best, torture is\nmorally justified in some one-off emergencies \u2013 just as murder and\ncannibalism might be morally excusable in a one-off emergency on the\nhigh seas, or desertion from the field of battle might be morally\njustifiable given a one-off emergency back home \u2013 but nothing\nfollows as far as the legalisation/institutionalisation of torture is\nconcerned.\n\nA final point here concerns the proposition that, absent\nlegalised/institutional torture, unlawful endemic torture in\nthe security agencies of contemporary liberal democracies confronting\nterrorism is inevitable. The implication here is that unless\nlegalised, torture will become endemic in these agencies. It has\nalready been argued that legalisation/institutionalisation of torture\nwould be profoundly damaging to liberal democratic institutions.\nAssume this is correct; it does not follow from this that a torture\nculture will not come to exist in those agencies in the context of\ntorture being unlawful. Nor does it follow that an unlawful torture\nculture, indeed an unlawful sub-institution of torture, is inevitable.\nHere there is a tendency to use the kind of argument that is plausible\nin relation to, say, the prohibition of alcohol. It is better to\nlegalise alcohol, because then it can be contained and controlled.\nThis form of argument used in relation to torture is spurious.\nConsuming alcohol to excess is not morally equivalent to torture, and\nwe do not legalise the use of alcohol in emergency situations only.\nLegalising the use of torture in extreme emergencies would be much\nmore akin to legalising perjury in extreme situations. As with\ntorture \u2013 and unlike alcohol \u2013 perjury is only morally\njustified in some extreme one-off\n situations.[19]\n However, no-one is seriously considering legalising perjury in\none-off extreme situations (at least to my knowledge), and with good\nreason \u2013 to do so would strike at the very heart of the legal\nsystem.\n\nThe fact is that the recent history of police, military, and other\norganisations in liberal democracies has demonstrated that torture\ncultures and sub-institutions of torture can be more or less\neliminated, albeit with considerable difficulty. The elimination of\ntorture cultures and sub-institutions can only be achieved if torture\nis unlawful, the community and the political and organisational\nleadership are strongly opposed to it, police officers and other\nrelevant institutional actors are appropriately educated and trained,\nand stringent accountability mechanisms, e.g., video-recording of\ninterviews, close-circuit TV cameras in cells, external oversight\nbodies, are put in place. It is surely obvious that to re-introduce\nand indeed protect the practice of torture, by legalising and\ninstitutionalising it, would be to catapult the security agencies of\nliberal democracies back into the dark ages from whence they came.\n\nThe discussion has focussed on the legalisation and\ninstitutionalisation of torture, where the practice of torture is\nunderstood in general terms; it ought to be now obvious why torture\nshould not be legalised. However, some commentators, notably Alan\nDershowitz, have argued that legalised torture could be justified, if\nthe torture in question was restricted to extreme emergency situations\nand subjected to appropriate accountability mechanisms. Specifically,\nhe has argued for torture warrants of the kind introduced for a time\nin Israel (Dershowitz 2003, 2004; and Wisnewski 2008).\n\nThe notion of torture warrants is supposedly analogous to surveillance\nand telephone interception warrants issued to police by a magistrate\nor other judicial officer. The idea is that privacy is a fundamental\nright but it can be infringed under certain conditions, such as\nreasonable suspicion that the person whose privacy right is to be\ninfringed is engaged in serious criminal activity, there is no\nalternative way to acquire the necessary information to convict\nhim/her, and so on. In this kind of set-up the magistrate, not the\npolice, makes the decision as to whether or not these conditions\nobtain. Consequently, the infringements of privacy rights are\nrestricted, and subject to stringent accountability mechanisms.\n\nHowever, morally speaking, torture warrants are entirely different\nfrom telephone interception or surveillance warrants. First, torture\nis a far greater evil than the infringement of privacy. For one thing,\nhaving one\u2019s phone tapped or movements filmed is inherently much\nless distressing, harmful and morally repugnant than the physical\nsuffering and loss of autonomy involved in being strapped to a chair\nand, say, having someone drill into an unanesthetised tooth. On the\nspectrum of evils, torture is closer to murder/killing than it is to\nthe infringement of privacy. For another thing, torture is a far more\ndangerous practice than infringing privacy. For the degree of the\ninfringement of privacy can be minimised, e.g., the information gained\ncan relatively easily be kept strictly confidential by the police;\nmoreover, there is no inherent reason for the police to illicitly\nwiden a given infringement of privacy by breaching confidentiality.\nBut in practice torture cannot be restricted likewise. The methods of\ntorture and the process of torture exist on a continuum, and there is\noften an inherent reason to \u2018push the envelope\u2019 and\ninflict ever more severe forms of physical suffering on victims;\nso-called \u2018torture lite\u2019 becomes full-blooded, no\nholds-barred torture. One of the consequences of this continuum of\ntorture is the ever-present possibility that the victims of torture\nwill not simply be tortured, but rather be murdered; and in point of\nfact numerous people have died in the course of being tortured.\n\nSecond, as has already been argued, there is an inherent institutional\nreceptivity of military, police, and correctional institutions to the\npractice of torture; a receptivity which is such that torture cultures\nwill grow and flourish, notwithstanding Dershowitz\u2019s proposal\nthat only tightly controlled and highly restricted forms of torture\nare to be legally admissible. This institutional receptivity has the\nconsequence that inevitably large numbers of innocent people will be\ntortured \u2013 as has happened in Israel (see PCATI 2003). Indeed,\neven under tightly controlled and highly restricted forms of torture\nsome innocent persons will inevitably be tortured \u2013 just as the\nprivacy of innocent people is infringed under the existing telephone\nand surveillance warrant systems. Arguably, the infringement of the\nprivacy of some \u2013 in fact, many \u2013 innocent persons is a price\nthat we ought to be willing to pay for the sake of preventing serious\ncrimes. However, it would be preposterous to argue that\n(inadvertently?) torturing numerous innocent people is a reasonable\nprice to pay in return for the information provided by those of the\ntortured who are in fact guilty.\n\nThird, the information gained by wire-tapping or surveillance has in\ngeneral far greater utility than that gained by means of the practice\nof torture \u2013 certainly by the tightly controlled and highly\nrestricted forms of torture of the kind envisaged by Dershowitz.\nIndeed, it is by no means clear that the utility \u2013 in terms of\nsaving lives (and leaving aside the costs) \u2013 of the system of\nlegalised torture warrants will be very high. (In Israel, to repeat\nthe example, it does not appear to have been particularly high.) This\nis so for two reasons. One reason is that torture victims typically\ntell the torturer whatever they think he wants to hear, e.g., they are\nhappy to implicate others who are in fact innocent in order to bring\nan end to their own agony. And even in relation to desired\ncheckable information there is often the problem of knowing\nwhether or not the victim of torture is holding out or does not really\nknow; this is especially the case with hardened terrorists. So by\ncomparison with telephone and surveillance warrants, torture warrants\nare likely to yield unreliable information; there is a serious\nquestion about the quality of much of the information provided under a\nsystem of torture warrants. A further reason to disparage the utility\nof torture warrants is that, again unlike telephone and surveillance\nwarrants, torture warrants are to be issued only in extreme\nemergencies. By contrast, telephone interception and surveillance\nwarrants are issued as a matter of routine, albeit only under certain\n(recurring) conditions. Accordingly, the volume of information capable\nof being provided under a system of torture warrants is extremely\nlimited. In short, over time the torture warrant system is likely only\nto yield an extremely small quantity of reliable information. This\noverall likely lack of utility of the torture warrant system qua\ninstitution is important to keep in mind in the context of a\nprotracted struggle against terrorism involving ongoing loss of life\non both sides. Here the torture warrant system stands in sharp\ncontrast to telephone interception and surveillance warrant systems.\nMoreover, it is precisely because the set of conditions under which it\nis reasonable and effective to infringe privacy rights recurs, that\ninfringements of privacy rights by police can reasonably be legalised\nand institutionalised, e.g., by means of a warrant system. Arguably,\nthe proponents of the torture warrant system have made the mistake of\nproposing a legal/institutional solution to what ought to be regarded\nas a one-off moral\n problem;[20]\n hence the inadequacy of their proposal.\n\nAt any rate, the conclusion must be that any attempt to compare\ntorture warrants to surveillance or interception warrants is entirely\nspurious. Torture is a very different beast.\n\nIn the light of the above three points concerning torture warrants\nthat have just been made in the comparison between these and\nsurveillance and interception warrants, the inevitable conclusion is\nthat the practice of torture could not be contained under a system of\nlegalised torture warrants and the consequences of its not being\ncontained would be horrific. Moreover, as noted above, and argued by\nLuban, Waldron and others, the damage to liberal institutions would be\nincalculable. Finally, the benefits of a system of legalised torture\nwarrants over the longer term are likely to be slight; and certainly\neasily outweighed by the costs. So Dershowitz is entirely misguided in\nhis advocacy of torture warrants. Indeed, as repeatedly mentioned\nabove, we have the example of Israel\u2019s use, or rather abuse, of\nthis system to provide specific empirical evidence against the\nintroduction of torture warrants.\n\nSo torture warrants are highly undesirable, indeed a threat to liberal\ndemocratic institutions. Moreover, torture warrants are unnecessary.\nAs has been argued above, there may well be one-off emergencies in\nwhich the use of torture is morally justifiable. In those cases, the\nrelevant public officials must bite the bullet and do what is morally\nrequired, e.g., torture the terrorist to save thousands of innocent\npeople. In such an emergency, the military or police officers involved\nwill need to break the law on this one occasion. But in itself this is\na small price to pay; and a price the police, the military and the\npoliticians have shown themselves only too willing to pay in\nsituations that are far from emergencies.\n\nOne final matter. What should be done to the military officer, police\nofficer, or other public official who tortures the terrorist\nif \u2013 after saving the city \u2013 their crime is discovered? Quite\nclearly he (or she) should resign or be dismissed from their position;\npublic institutions cannot suffer among their ranks those who commit\nserious crimes. Further, the public official in question must be\ntried, convicted, and sentenced for committing the crime of\n torture.[21]\n Obviously, there are (to say the least) mitigating circumstances, and\nthe sentence should be commuted to, say, one day in prison. Would\npublic officials be prepared to act to save thousands of innocent\nlives, if they knew they might lose their job and/or suffer some minor\npunishment? Presumably many would be prepared to so act in these\ncircumstances. On the other hand, perhaps many public officials would\nnever set aside their interest in keeping their jobs and avoiding\nminor punishments in order to save innocent lives. If so, this is not\na consideration in favour of legalising torture. For surely the\nconsequences of setting up a legalised torture chamber and putting\nsuch self-interested and uncaring persons in charge of it are likely\nto be horrendous\n",
