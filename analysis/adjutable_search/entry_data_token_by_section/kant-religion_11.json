    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Philosophy of Religion during the Critical Period || .6 The Parerga or General Remarks\n4. Religion in the Opus Postumum\n\nIn the mid-1790s, Kant began to explore what he saw as a \u201cgap...\nin the critical philosophy\u201d (Kant to Garve, September 21, 1798\nAK 12:257), namely, how to transition from what he established about\nnatural science in general in the Metaphysical Foundations of\nNatural Science to physics in particular. However, his notes on\nthis \u201cgap\u201d exceeded his original plan, as they came to\ncover not only how to transition from the foundations of natural\nscience to physics, but also self-positing, God, and the nature of\ntranscendental philosophy. These notes, which were composed during a\nroughly seventeen-year period, and came to be assembled under the\ntitle, Opus Postumum, prompt questions as to whether or not\nKant\u2019s views on God during this period represent a break from or\ncontinuity with the philosophy of religion he presented in his\nprevious works. And further, if there is continuity, in what way might\nits contents help to illuminate Kant\u2019s overall Critical\nphilosophy of religion?\n\nFor instance, there are many passages in the Opus Postumum\nwhich present God not as a substance or a being outside of us, but\nrather an ideal or thought-object. For some, this is taken as an\nindication that in Kant\u2019s final years, he withdrew from his more\naffirmative religious views seen up through the mid-1790s\n(F\u00f6rster 2000). While for others, it finally articulates the view\nthat Kant held throughout the Critical period, namely that despite\ntextual evidence to the contrary, Kant never advanced any argument,\nmoral or otherwise, for belief in God (W. Sullivan 1971, Guyer 2000,\nByrne 2007).\n\nNevertheless, amidst the passages in the Opus Postumum which\npresent God as merely an ideal or thought-object, there are others\nwhich are not so deflationary, presenting God in a manner similar to\nthe more familiar works of the Critical period (AK 21:13\u201314 [OP\n220\u2013222], AK 22:126\u2013127 [OP 206\u2013207]).\n\nOne way to understand these discrepancies is to recognize that the\nOpus Postumum is a collection of notes written over more than\na decade, unedited, and possibly different from what would have been\nthe final version of the treatise. Hence, Kant might have been\nrethinking his philosophy of religion, exploring possibilities, or\nworking through some ideas which could fill his perceived \u201cgap\nin the critical philosophy\u201d, ideas that neither undercut the\nepistemic strictures of the Critique of Pure Reason nor the\nreligiously affirmative language in his practical philosophy.\n\nFurther, though Kant sometimes describes God as an ideal or\nthought-object, he also says the same about the world and\nman-in-the-world, raising the possibility that his discussions of God\ntook place in two separate spheres: transcendental philosophy proper,\nwhich provides the purely formal conditions of metaphysics and so\nincludes only the ideals we must construct in order to posit ourselves\nin the world (namely, God, the world, and man-in-the-world); and\nmetaphysics, which is transcendental philosophy applied to certain\nobjects (\u201c[the transcendental philosopher] addresses merely what\nis formal, [the metaphysician] what is material (the object, the\nmaterial)\u201d [AK 21:79 [OP: 246]]). If this is right, then it\ncould be that Kant does not repudiate or deflate his prior philosophy\nof religion, but merely adds a new layer to it. Unfortunately, the\nOpus Postumum\u2019s unfinished state makes it difficult to\ncome to a secure conclusion about where Kant\u2019s thinking on\nreligion stood in his final years.\n",
