While F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives what we can think of as\nan Arabic analogue to Aristotle\u2019s discussion in\nMetaphysics V,7 of the many meanings of \u201cbeing\u201d,\nthe Arabic analogue focusses on several features that the Greek\noriginal does not: the paronymous form of the word\nmawj\u00fbd, the difficulties that led the translators to\ndraft the word mawj\u00fbd, literally \u201cfound\u201d,\ninto service as an equivalent to the Greek word for being, and the\nrelation between mawj\u00fbd = \u201cbeing\u201d in the\nsense of \u201cthat which is\u201d, and wuj\u00fbd =\n\u201cexistence\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d in the sense of\n\u201cthe being of that which is\u201d. Furthermore, while the use\nof mawj\u00fbd in the syllogistic arts to mean\n\u201cbeing\u201d is always a metaphorical extension from the\noriginal meaning \u201cfound\u201d, and its use,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also thinks that mawj\u00fbd =\n\u201cbeing\u201d has different meanings in different\nsyllogistic arts, and in particular that it has a distinctive meaning\nin demonstrative science, contrasting with its meaning in dialectic,\nand that the paronymous form of the word, while it has some\njustification in dialectic, is more seriously misleading in\ndemonstrative science. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that bringing\nout the distinctive scientific meaning of \u201cbeing\u201d, and the\ndistinctive logical form of the word \u201cbeing\u201d as used in\ndemonstrative science, will show the path to a scientific treatment of\nbeing, based on distinctively scientific ways of investigating (for a\ngiven X) both the question whether X is and\nthe question what X is.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says:\n\n\nin all other languages [i.e., other than Arabic], such as Persian and\nSyriac and Sogdian, there is an expression which they use to signify\nall things without specifying one thing as opposed to another thing\n[i.e., it is a predicate which is true of any subject whatever], and\nthey also use it to signify the connection\n[rib\u00e2\u1e6d, elsewhere translated\n\u201ccopula\u201d] between the predicate and what it is predicated\nof: this is what connects the predicate with the subject when the\npredicate is a noun or when they want the predicate to be connected\nwith the subject absolutely, without any mention of time. (Book of\nLetters I,82, p.111,4\u20138)\n\n\nA brief summary is given below of F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nview on how being is expressed in Greek and Arabic, and of the\ndifficulties faced by the Arabic translators, but for a fuller\ndiscussion see\n Supplement: F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee on the word for being, in Greek and Arabic\n\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee assumes that Greek (like Arabic)\ndistinguishes syntactically between tensed and tenseless sentences,\nand that (unlike Arabic) it expresses the copula in both kinds of\nsentences. Because, according to Aristotle\u2019s definition of\n\u201cverb\u201d in On Interpretation 3, a verb must\n\u201cconsignify a time\u201d, the tenseless copula cannot be a\nverb. Nor can it be a noun: if to predicate one noun of another we\nmust insert a third noun between them, there will be an infinite\nregress of copulas. So the tenseless copula estin (or\nast\u00een), in Greek as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nreconstructs it, must be a particle, although there will also be\ntensed copulas which are verbs paronymously derived from this\nparticle. He also thinks that the same particle can function, not only\nin 2-place contexts, i.e., in tenseless predicative statements\n\u201cX is Y\u201d, but also in 1-place contexts,\ni.e., in tenseless statements of existence \u201cX\nis\u201d: and he assumes that this is the word that Aristotle is\ndiscussing in the chapter on the meanings of being,\nMetaphysics V,7.\n\nWe have seen that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that all languages\nother than Arabic have a word with these functions. Since\nArabic has no word that does all these things, he thinks that the\nArabic translators of Greek philosophical texts have had trouble with\nthis word, and he discusses different strategies that they have\nadopted. The most common strategy is to use the Arabic passive\nparticiple \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d, literally\n\u201cfound\u201d, as a tenseless \u201cis\u201d in both 1-place\nor 2-place contexts, and to use passive forms of the verb\n\u201cwajada\u201d, \u201cfind\u201d, for the tensed\n\u201cis\u201d and \u201cwas\u201d and \u201cwill be\u201d. The\ndisadvantage of \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d is that then the\nArabic word for \u201cis\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d, unlike the\nGreek word it translates, is grammatically paronymous, so that its\ngrammatical form does not correspond to its logical form:\n\nthe expression \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d is, in its first\nimposition in Arabic, paronymous, and every paronymous term by its\nconstruction gives the impression that there is in what it signifies\nan implicit subject and, in this subject, the meaning\n[ma\u201bn\u00e2] of the ma\u1e63dar [the\ninfinitive, functioning in Arabic as an abstract noun] from which [the\nterm] was derived [i.e., as \u201cwhite\u201d implies, without\nexplicitly mentioning, a subject in which whiteness is present]. For\nthis reason the expression \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d has\ngiven the impression that there is in every thing a meaning/entity\n[ma\u201bn\u00e2] in an implicit subject, and that this\nmeaning/entity is what is signified by the expression\n\u201cwuj\u00fbd\u201d [\u201cfinding\u201d or\n\u201cbeing found\u201d]: so it gave the impression that\nwuj\u00fbd is in an implicit subject, and\nwuj\u00fbd was understood as being like an accident in a\nsubject. (Book of Letters I,84, p.113,9\u201314)\n\nThere is thus a grammatical appearance that X exists or is a\nbeing (\u201cX mawj\u00fbd\u201d) through an\naccident of existence or beingness which inheres in X, or an\nact of finding X; and F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that\nthis appearance gives rise to serious metaphysical errors. His account\nof the logical syntax of being in the Book of Letters is\ndesigned to expose and root out these errors. In particular, it will\nfunction as a critique of anyone who wants to understand God as\nsomething like a Platonic form of being, so that other things would\nexist by participating in this form. (Averroes, later, will adapt\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s account of the logical syntax of\nbeing to give a criticism of Avicenna\u2019s distinction between\nessence and existence, see Menn 2011.) But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nalso wants to give the ontological foundations for a positive\nmetaphysical account of God, which he thinks Aristotle was aiming at\nin Metaphysics XII and which he will try to reconstruct in\nhis Principles of the Opinions of the People of the Perfect\nCity and his Political Regime (see\n Section 4\n below).\n",
