    "main_text": "The Intentional Distinction\n4. The Intentional Distinction\n\n\nThe term intentio must not be taken in the narrow sense\nwith which, for example, one speaks of intentiones secundae as\nnomina nominum (individual, genus, species, difference,\nproperty, accident, etc.), but rather as a \u2018note\u2019 (feature,\ntrait) of the essential content of a res, which does not\ndiffer from it in any real sense, nor from its other identifiable\n\u2018notes\u2019, yet can nevertheless be expressed by an\nindependent concept (\u201cappellatur hic intentio aliquid pertinens\nrealiter ad simplicitatem essentiae alicuius, natum praecise concipi\nabsque aliquo alio a quo non differt re absoluta, quod similiter\npertinet ad eandem.\u201d; Quodl. V, q. 6, ed. 1518, f.\n161rL). Intentio is thus the fruit of an operation of the\nintellect, which delves inside (for Henry intentio comes from\nintus tentio) the thing to which the intention itself belongs,\nby considering its constitutive \u2018notes\u2019 and giving rise to\ndifferent concepts. It can also be said that intentions really exist in\na res, but only potentially, whereas their distinction is an\noperation of the intellect alone.\n\n\nWhile two distinct things differ in a real sense, all that gives\nrise to different concepts, albeit founded in the same simple thing,\ndiffers intentionally (\u201cdiversa intentione sunt quae fundata in\nsimplicitate eisudem rei diversos de se formant conceptus.\u201d;\nQuodl. V, q. 12, ed. 1518, f. 171rT). In an intentional\ndistinction, in other words, the very same thing is expressed by\ndifferent concepts in different ways. From this perspective, an\nintentional distinction seems akin to a purely logical (or reasoned)\ndistinction, to the point that the two are often confused\n(\u201cfrequenter intentio ratio appellatur.\u201d; Quodl.\nV, q. 12, ed. 1518, f. 171rV). Nevertheless, in the first case, one of\nthe concepts excludes the other (one can be thought of separately, in\nthe absence of the other), whereas in the case of a distinction based\non reason the various concepts are perfectly compatible (\u201cin\ndiversis secundum intentionem unus conceptus secundum unum modum\nexcludit alium secundum alium modum, non sic autem differentia sola\nratione.\u201d; Quodl. V, q. 12, ed. 1518, f. 171rV). As\nHenry explicitly states, this means that everything that differs in\nintention differs in reason too, but not vice versa. Unlike a purely\nlogical distinction, an intentional distinction always implies a form\nof composition, even though this is minor with regard to that implied\nby a real difference.\n\n\nThe clearest examples of this are found in Quodl. X, q. 7,\nwhere Henry responds rather sharply to the perplexities raised by Giles\nof Rome over the concept itself of intentional distinction.\n\u201cMan\u201d and \u201crational animal\u201d \u2014 the defined\nand the definition \u2014 differ only in terms of reason, whereas\n\u201cwhite\u201d and \u201crational\u201d differ in a real sense,\nsince it is a matter of different natures and not of concepts or\nintentions founded in the same res. Yet how should we consider\nthe difference between \u201crational\u201d and \u201canimal\u201d?\nThis is not a distinction of reason, since the two terms are not in a\nrelation of definition to defined, nor is it a real distinction, such\nas that between substance and accident, since, if this were the case,\nthe species formed by the conjunction of \u201canimal\u201d and\n\u201crational\u201d would not be a single one in itself, but only\nper accidens. Therefore we can only appeal to an intermediate\ndistinction, which is precisely that which Henry defines as\nintentional.\n\n\nFor Henry there are two levels of intentional distinction: a major\nand a minor. In the major none of the intentions includes the other or\nothers, even though they are all part of the same thing, and it has two\nmodes: the distinction between the differences in man (rational,\nsensible, vegetative and so on) and the distinction between genus and\nspecific difference (animal and rational). In the minor the concept of\none intention includes the other but not vice versa. And here Henry\nlists four modes: the distinction between species and genus; the\ndistinction between living and being in creatures; the distinction\nbetween a suppositum and its nature or essence; and the\ndistinction between a respectus (relation) and the essence on\nwhich it is founded (Macken 1981). The distinction between being and\nessence belongs to the last mode. Since being is not a real accident\ninhering in a subject, it makes no sense to speak of a real\ndistinction. Instead, the distinction depends on the fact that the\nintellect uses different concepts to indicate the being of a thing, on\nthe one hand, and that which a thing is, on the other. Nevertheless,\nsince essence can be thought of independently from its being, and being\nis not part of its content, we cannot refer here to a distinction based\non reason alone. In other words, whereas the concept of actual\nexistence always includes the concept of essence, the contrary is not\ntrue, since essence can be thought of without its being (as affirmed by\nAvicenna). Being and essence are therefore different intentions, not\ndifferent things (as instead was maintained by Giles of Rome in his\nlong dispute with Henry). This intentional distinction is in itself\nsufficient to refute the conclusion that every essence is its\nbeing.\n",
