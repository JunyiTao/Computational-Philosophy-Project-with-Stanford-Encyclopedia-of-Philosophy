    "main_text": "Controversies Surrounding Desire || The Direction of Fit of Desires\n3.1 The Direction of Fit of Desires\n\n\nSince Anscombe, desires are said to have a \u201cdirection of\nfit,\u201d and one that is the opposite to the \u201cdirection of\nfit\u201d of beliefs. One modest way of putting the point is this:\nbeliefs are like declarative sentences, which are satisfied (made true)\nby whether the world as it is conforms to them, but desires are like\nimperative sentences, which are satisfied (fulfilled) by changes in the\nworld bringing the world into conformity with them. What exactly\nthis analogy amounts to, literally, is controversial. Is it perhaps\nthat one's beliefs ought to conform to the world, whereas the\nworld ought to conform to one's desires (Gregory 2012)? Is it perhaps that the\nworld tends to cause satisfied beliefs (true beliefs), while desires\ntend to cause there to be a desire-satisfying (desire-fulfilling)\nworld? This is still an area in which it is difficult to know just how\nto evaluate the proposals on offer, and there is little sign of a\nconsensus emerging in the foreseeable future (see, e.g., Anscombe 2000;\nSchueler 1991; Smith 1994; Zangwill 1998).\n\n\nAnother and related puzzle is over whether there might be states of\nmind with both desire-like and belief-like directions of fit. These\nstates of mind, sometimes called \u2018besires\u2019, are said to be\nof particular interest to ethicists interested in the possibility of\nbelief-like attitudes motivating action all on their own (see, e.g.,\nSmith 1994 chapter 4; Zangwill 2008).\n",
