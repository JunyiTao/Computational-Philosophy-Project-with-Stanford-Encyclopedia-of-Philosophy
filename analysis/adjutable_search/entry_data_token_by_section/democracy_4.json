    "main_text": "The Authority of Democracy\n3. The Authority of Democracy\n\nSince democracy is a collective decision process, the question\nnaturally arises about whether there is any duty of citizens to obey\ndemocratic decisions when they disagree with it.\n\nThere are three main concepts of the legitimate authority of the\nstate. First, a state has legitimate authority to the extent that it\nis morally justified in coercively imposing its rule on the members.\nLegitimate authority on this account has no direct implications\nconcerning the obligations or duties that citizens may hold toward\nthat state. It simply says that if the state is morally justified in\ndoing what it does, then it has legitimate authority. Second, a state\nhas legitimate authority to the extent that its directives generate\nduties in citizens to obey. The duties of the citizens need not be\nowed to the state but they are real duties to obey. The third is that\nthe state has a right to rule that is correlated with the\ncitizens\u2019 duty to it to obey it. This is the strongest notion of\nauthority and it seems to be the core idea behind the legitimacy of\nthe state. The idea is that when citizens disagree about law and\npolicy it is important to be able to answer the question, who has the\nright to choose?\n",
