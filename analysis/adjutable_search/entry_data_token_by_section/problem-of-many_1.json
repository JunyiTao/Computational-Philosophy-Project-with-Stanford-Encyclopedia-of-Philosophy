    "main_text": "Nihilism\n2. Nihilism\n\nUnger\u2019s original solution was to reject 1. The concept of a\ncloud involved, he thought, inconsistent presuppositions. Since those\npresuppositions were not satisfied, there are no clouds. This is a\nrather radical move, since it applies not just to clouds, but to any\nkind of sortal for which a similar problem can be generated. And,\nUnger pointed out, this includes most sortals. As Lewis puts it,\n\u201cThink of a rusty nail, and the gradual transition from steel\n\u2026 to rust merely resting on the nail. Or think of a cathode,\nand its departing electrons. Or think of anything that undergoes\nevaporation or erosion or abrasion. Or think of yourself, or any\norganism, with parts that gradually come loose in metabolism or\nexcretion or perspiration or shedding of dead skin\u201d (Lewis 1993:\n165).\n\nDespite Lewis\u2019s presentation, the Problem of the Many is not a\nproblem about change. The salient feature of these examples is that,\nin practice, change is a slow process. Hence whenever a cathode, or a\nhuman, is changing, be it by shedding electrons, or shedding skin,\nthere are some things that are not clearly part of the object, nor\nclearly not part of it. Hence there are distinct sets that each have a\ngood claim to being the set of parts of the cathode, or of the human,\nand that is what is important.\n\nIt would be profoundly counterintuitive if there were no clouds, or no\ncathodes, or no humans, and that is probably enough to reject the\nposition, if any of the alternatives are not also equally\ncounterintuitive. It also, as Unger noted, creates difficulties for\nmany views about singular thought and talk. Intuitively, we can pick\nout one of the objects composed of water droplets by the phrase\n\u2018that cloud\u2019. But if it is not a cloud, then possibly we\ncannot. For similar reasons, we may not be able to name any such\nobject, if we use any kind of reference-fixing description involving\n\u2018cloud\u2019 to pick it out from other objects composed of\nwater droplets. If the Problem of the Many applies to humans as well\nas clouds, then by similar reasoning we cannot name or demonstrate any\nhuman, or, if you think there are no humans, any human-like object.\nUnger was happy to take these results to be philosophical discoveries,\nbut they are so counterintuitive that most theorists hold that they\nform a reductio of his theory. Bradley Rettler (2018) argues that the\nnihilist has even more problems than this. Nihilism solves some\nphilosophical problems, such as explaining which of 0\u20137 is false. But,\nhe argues, for any problem it solves, there is a parallel problem\nwhich it does not solve, but rival solutions do solve. For instance,\nif you think of the problem here as a version of a\n Sorites paradox,\n nihilism does not help with versions of the paradox which concern\npredicates applied to simples.\n\nIt is interesting that some other theories of vagueness have adopted\npositions resembling Unger\u2019s in some respects, but without the\nextreme conclusions. Matti Eklund (2002) and Roy Sorensen (2001) have\nargued that all vague concepts involve inconsistent presuppositions.\nSorensen spells this out by saying that there are some inconsistent\npropositions that anyone who possesses a vague concept should believe.\nIn the case of a vague predicate F that is vulnerable to a\nSorites paradox, the inconsistent propositions are that some things\nare Fs, some things are not Fs, any object that\nclosely resembles (in a suitable respect) something that is F\nis itself F, and that there are chains of \u2018suitably\nresembling\u2019 objects between an F and a non-F.\nHere the inconsistent propositions are that a story like Lewis\u2019s\nis possible, and in it 0 through 7 are true. Neither Eklund nor\nSorensen conclude from this that nothing satisfies the predicates in\nquestion; rather they conclude that some propositions that we find\ncompelling merely in virtue of possessing the concepts from which they\nare constituted are false. So while they don\u2019t adopt\nUnger\u2019s nihilist conclusions, two contemporary theorists agree\nwith him that vague concepts are in some sense incoherent.\n",
