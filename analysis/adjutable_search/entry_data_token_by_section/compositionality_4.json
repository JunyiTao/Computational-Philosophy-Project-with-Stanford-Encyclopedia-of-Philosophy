    "main_text": "Clarifications || Determination\n1.4 Determination\n\nIntuitively, if a language is compositional it cannot contain a pair\nof non-synonymous complex expressions with identical structure and\npairwise synonymous constituents. This should follow from the fact\nthat the same structure and the same meanings of constituents cannot\ndetermine more than one meaning within a language. But to\nensure that the inference really holds, we need to rule out a certain\nreading of\n (C).\n \n\nFine (2007) advocates the following view: \u2018Cicero\u2019 and\n\u2018Tully\u2019 are synonyms, but \u2018Cicero is Cicero\u2019\nand \u2018Cicero is Tully\u2019 are not, despite the fact that these\nsentences do have the same structure. The meaning-difference arises\nfrom the fact that the former sentence encodes semantic co-reference\nbut the latter does not. All this is fully compatible with English not\nbeing a counterexample to (C\\(_{\\textit{coll}}\\)):\n\n(C\\(_{\\textit{coll}}\\))For\nevery complex expression e in L, the\nmeaning of e in L is determined by the structure of\ne in L and the meanings of the constituents of e\nin L collectively.\n\n\nOn Fine\u2019s view, what the constituents of \u2018Cicero is\nCicero\u2019 collectively mean goes beyond what the\nconstituents of \u2018Cicero is Tully\u2019 do. The collective\nmeaning comprises the individual meanings plus certain\nmeaning-relations that hold among them. Call the weak principle\n(C\\(_{\\textit{coll}}\\)) collective compositionality;\nfollowing usual practice\n (C)\n will be understood as distributive compositionality. \n\nIt is clear that the meanings of complex expressions depend on the\nindividual meanings of their parts. Thus, the only chance for\n(C\\(_{\\textit{coll}}\\)) to be true is if the collective meaning of\nconstituents (whatever that might be) determines each of the\nindividual meanings of constituents. This is certainly so on\nFine\u2019s view: he thinks the meaning of \u2018Cicero is\nCicero\u2019 depends on its structure (this is why it is not\nsynonymous with \u2018Is Cicero Cicero?\u2019), on the individual\nmeanings of its constituents (this is why it is not synonymous with\n\u2018Cicero is Caesar\u2019), and in addition on the\nintended co-reference relation between the subject and the object,\nwhich is an aspect of the collective meaning of its constituents (this\nis why it is not synonymous with \u2018Cicero is Tully\u2019).\n\nGiven the distributive reading,\n (C)\n rules out only the existence of a pair of non-synonymous complex\nexpressions with identical structure and pairwise synonymous\nconstituents within a single language. This is a problem\nbecause the existence of such a pair is a clear violation of what we\nnormally mean by determination even if the expressions belong to\ndistinct languages. \n\nHere is an illustration from Szab\u00f3 (2000b). Suppose English is\ncompositional. Take two of its non-synonymous sentences\u2014say,\n\u2018Elephants are grey\u2019 and \u2018Julius Caesar was murdered\non the ides of March\u2019\u2014and define Crypto-English as the\nlanguage with the same expressions, the same syntax and almost the\nsame semantics as English. The only difference is that if a\nsentence is synonymous in English with one of the two designated\nsentences, then it is synonymous with the other in Crypto-English. We\nassumed English is compositional and hence that there is no pair of\nnon-synonymous complex expressions in English with identical structure\nand pairwise synonymous constituents. Trivially, the same must hold\nfor Crypto-English as well. But intuitively, Crypto-English is\nnot compositional. The structure and the meanings of\nconstituents of the Crypto-English sentence \u2018Elephants are\ngrey\u2019 cannot determine what this sentence means in\nCrypto-English\u2014if they did then the structure and the meanings\nof constituents of the English sentence \u2018Elephants are\ngrey\u2019 would have to determine what \u2018Julius Caesar was\nmurdered on the ides of March\u2019 means in English.\n\nIf we want a better match with our intuitions, we must demand more\nfrom a compositional language than the mere existence of a\nfunction from structures and the meanings of parts to the\nmeanings of wholes. One possibility would be to put constraints on\nthis function\u2014we could demand, for example that it be\ncomputable, or perhaps even that the computation be reasonably quick.\nBut the above example shows that such a strengthening would not solve\nthe problem: if computing the meanings of complex expressions is easy\nin English, it will not be hard in Crypto-English either. We might\ninstead opt for the following strengthening of\n (C):\n\n(C\\(_{\\textit{cross}}\\))\nFor every complex expression e in L, the meaning\nof e in L is functionally determined through a single\nfunction for all possible human languages by the structure of e\nin L and the meanings of the constituents of e\nin L.\n\n\nCall the strengthened principle cross-linguistic\ncompositionality, and\n (C)\u2014when\n \u2018determine\u2019 is simply read as \u2018functionally\ndetermine\u2019 and we may have different functions for different\nlanguages\u2014language-bound compositionality. Note that\nformal languages that are designed to satisfy language-bound\ncompositionality may nonetheless violate cross-linguistic\ncompositionality simply because their syntax or the meanings of their\nconstituents violate some universal constraint on human languages.\nNote also that whatever the epistemic status of other versions of the\nprinciple of compositionality might be, cross-linguistic\ncompositionality is clearly an empirical\n hypothesis.[9]\n\nWhen speaking of compositionality unqualified, I will always mean\nlanguage-bound compositionality. Again, the stronger principle is much\ncloser to our pre-theoretic intuitions and it is often tacitly assumed\nin practice. But the traditional considerations in favor of\ncompositionality support the weaker thesis only.\n",
