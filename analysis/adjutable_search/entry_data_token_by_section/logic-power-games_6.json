If we think of the Countries in our\nprevious example as individual players and their votes as individual\nstrategies, we can model the Treaty of Rome game as a non-cooperative\ngame, where each individual can vote an amount of money to dedicate to\nborder protection and preferences are as above.\n\nThe outcome function will take care to associate to each individual\nplayer\u2019s vote the final outcome of the collective decision,\ne.g., selecting an outcome voted by a set of Countries with voting\nweight of at least 12, or resulting in no decision if no consensus is\nreached.\n\nFor instance:\n\nFrance vote 0M\nBelgium vote 2M\nItaly vote 10M\nGermany vote 0M\nThe Netherlands vote 0M\nLuxembourg vote 0M\n\n\nThis round results in no decision, because no outcome has collected\nvoting weight of at least 12.\n\nHowever, suppose that the second round is such that everyone but\nBelgium stick to their vote, and assume Belgium switches to voting 0M.\nNow 0M has an aggregate of 13, which means it is chosen as the final\ndecision.\n\n\nLooking at the unified treatment of our example, there seem to be\nrelationship between non-cooperative games and cooperative games. This\nrelationship can be specified formally.\n\nLet us first consider what a group of players can do in a game. To do\nso we define the \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function, a\nmathematical description of coalitional strategies in a game in terms\nof the sets outcomes that they can force.\n\n\nDefinition 12. [\\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function] Let\n\\(S\\) be a non-cooperative game. We define the \\(\\alpha\\) effectivity\nfunction of \\(S\\), \\(E^{\\alpha}_S(C)\\), where \\(\\overline{C}\\) is the\ncomplement of \\(C\\):\n\n\\(E^{\\alpha}_S(C)= \\{X\\ \\mid\\) there exists \\(\\sigma_C\\) such that for\nall \\(\\sigma'_{\\overline{C}}\\) we have that\n\\(o(\\sigma_C,\\sigma'_{\\overline{C}})\\in X \\}\\)\n\n\nIntuitively the \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function of \\(S\\) collects, for\nevery group of players, the set of outcomes that they can achieve by\nfixing a strategy of theirs, no matter how their opponents play.\n\nThe following result shows the relationship between strategies and\neffectivity functions.\n\nTheorem 13 (Goranko et al. 2013). An\neffectivity function is truly playable if and only if it is the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function of some non-cooperative game.\n\nThis is a generalization of the result in Peleg 1998 for finite games,\nstarting from models of non-cooperative games first defined in Pauly\n2001. In a nutshell what these results imply is the following.\n\n\nProposition 14. Let \\(F\\) be a relational game\nstructure. Then \\(E_w\\) is the \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function of some\nnon-cooperative game, for each \\(w \\in W\\), if and only if the\nfollowing formulas are valid in \\(F\\) for disjoint\n\\(C,C^{\\prime}\\):\n\n\\(\\varphi \\to \\psi \\models_F [C]\\varphi \\to [C]\\psi\\)\n\\(\\models_F [C] \\top\\)\n\\(\\models_F \\neg [C] \\bot\\)\n\\(\\models_F \\neg [\\emptyset] \\varphi \\to [N]\\varphi\\)\n\\(\\models_F [C^{\\prime}] \\varphi \\wedge [C]\\psi \\to [C^{\\prime}\n\\cup C](\\varphi \\wedge \\psi)\\)\n\n\n\nIn the same way we did for cooperative games, we can ask ourselves\nwhether an outcome is stable, or rational, in a strategic\nsituation.\n\nNash equilibrium and definability The main solution\nconcept to analyze non-cooperative games is Nash equilibrium.\nInformally a Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one per\nplayer, such that no player is interested to change his or her\nstrategy, given the others stick to theirs. Formally, a strategy\nprofile \\(\\sigma\\) is a (pure strategy) Nash\nequilibrium if for all players \\(i\\in N\\) and for all\n\\(\\sigma'_i\\in \\Sigma_i\\) we have that \n\\[o(\\sigma_i,\\sigma_{-i}) \\succeq_i o(\\sigma'_i,\\sigma_{-i})\\]\n\n\n\nExample 8. Consider the following vote\n\nFrance vote 5M\nBelgium vote 5M\nItaly vote 10M\nGermany vote 1M\nThe Netherlands vote 5M\nLuxembourg vote 5M\n\n\nIn this game there is no consensus on any budget. The situation might\nlook like a deadlock, as everyone has voted according to their\npreference. However the outcome is disagreement, which no player\nprefers to any agreement. The only way that players can converge to an\nagreement is that Italy change their vote to 5M. If this happens 5M is\nachieved as an outcome.\n\nNotice that the modified game, in which Italy vote 5M is a Nash\nequilibrium.\n\nConsider now a modification of the game above, in which Italy and The\nNetherlands vote 10M, while the others stick to their vote.\nSurprisingly, despite the disagreement, this is Nash equilibrium,\nbecause no player is simultaneously able to get to some agreement,\nalthough being willing to do so.\n\n\nHow to express Nash equilibria in logic? Recall how the formula\n\n\\[p\\to \\bigvee_{C\\subseteq N} [C]\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)\\]\n\n\nholds at a frame \\(F\\) if and only if the core is empty, and a hybrid\nlogic extension can tell us whether a specific outcome belongs to the\ncore. If \\(F\\) is based on a truly playable effectivity function we\nalready have a non-cooperative form game version of the core: an\noutcome such that no coalition is together able and willing to deviate\nfrom, not taking into account what the others do. However\nNash Equilibrium fixes a profile of strategies, such that no player is\nable and willing to deviate from there. In other words it requires the\nnotion of best response for a player with respect to a given\nprofile.\n\nFormalisms such as Coalition Logic are too weak to express Nash\nequilibria. However, they can express the fact that certain\neffectivity functions allow for the possibility of a Nash equilibrium.\nThis is what in Hansen & Pauly 2002 is called Nash-consistent\nCoalition Logic. Nash Equilibrium is in fact not definable in basic\nmodal logic (van Benthem et al. 2011), but it can be done\nwith a modality that intersects both the preference and the\nchoice relations (van Benthem et al. 2011) (for choice\nrelations see Section 3.2.2 below).\n\n\n\\((F,V),w\\models \\langle \\approx_i \\cap \\succ_i \\rangle \\varphi\\) if\nand only if \\(w(\\approx_i \\cap \\succ_i)w'\\) implies that \\(w'\\models\n\\varphi \\)\n\n\nThen the best response for \\(i\\) is defined as \\( \\langle \\approx_i\n\\cap \\succ_i \\rangle \\top\\), as there is no alternative that is at the\nsame time achievable and preferable to \\(i\\). Alternatively a hybrid\nlogic that mentions strategy profiles in the language can provide a\nsolution, similarly to the case of the core.\n3.2.1 Injective Games and PDL with Intersection\n\nThe general definition of non-cooperative games given above allows\ngames where two different strategy profiles lead to the same outcome,\ni.e., where \\(o(\\sigma) = o(\\sigma')\\) for \\(\\sigma \\neq \\sigma'\\)-\nwhere the outcome function is not injective. However in game\ntheory injectivity is very often implicitly or explicitly assumed.\nIndeed, outcomes are often identified with strategy profiles.\n\nIt is thus a natural question what happens to Coalition Logic when we\nrestrict non-cooperative games to be injective. The answer is that,\nfirst, not much: the language of Coalition Logic cannot discern\nbetween injective and non-injective games (Goranko et al.\n2006). But, second, the class of effectivity functions changes: not\nall truly playable effectivity functions are \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity\nfunctions of injective games.\n\nRecall the well-foundedness property of effectivity\nfunctions: if \\(X \\in E(N)\\)then \\(\\{x\\} \\in E(N)\\) for some \\(x \\in\nX\\). This is in fact equivalent (Goranko et al. 2013) to the\nproperty that \\(E(\\emptyset)\\) has a complete non-monotonic\ncore. The non-monotonic core \\(E^{nc}(C)\\)of \\(E(C)\\) its minimal\nelements: \\(E^{nc}(C) = \\{X \\in E(C) : \\neg \\exists Y (Y \\in E(C)\n\\text{ and } Y \\subset X\\}\\). The non-monotonic core is\ncomplete if and only if for every \\(X \\in E(C)\\) there is a\n\\(Y \\in E^{nc}(C)\\) such that \\(Y \\subseteq X\\). While true\nplayability implies that the non-monotonic core for the empty\ncoalition is complete, that is not the case for arbitrary\ncoalitions.\n\nIt is, however, for injective games: in addition to the true\nplayability properties, the \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity functions of\ninjective games have a complete non-monotonic core for all\ncoalitions. In addition, the non-monotonic core has some\nstructural properties. In more detail, we say that an effectivity\nfunction \\(E\\) is injectively playable (\u00c5gotnes and\nAlechina 2015) iff it is truly playable and has the following\nadditional properties, for all \\(C, i, j, X, Y\\):\n\n\\(E(C)\\) has a complete non-monotonic core;\n\\(E^{nc}(C) = \\{\\bigcap_{i \\in C} X_i : X_i \\in E^{nc}(\\{i\\})\\}\\)\nwhen \\(C \\neq \\emptyset\\);\nif \\(X, Y \\in E^{nc}(\\{i\\})\\) and \\(X \\neq Y\\) then \\(X \\cap Y =\n\\emptyset\\);\nif \\(X \\in E^{nc}(j)\\) and \\(x \\in X\\) then \\(\\exists Y \\in\nE^{nc}(i), x \\in Y\\).\n\n\nIt follows that \\(E(C)\\) is completely determined by its non-monotonic\ncore.\n\nTheorem 15. (\u00c5gotnes and Alechina 2015) An\neffectivity function is injectively playable if and only if it is the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity function of some injective non-cooperative\ngame.\n\nIntersection plays a key role in the effectivity of\ncoalitions in games: intuitively, the power of a coalition is the\nintersection of the power of the individuals in the coalition. A\nnatural idea then, due to van Benthem 2012, is that coalitional power\ncould perhaps be expressed by using intersection\nmodalities. This is indeed the case, in the following precise\nsense (\u00c5gotnes and Alechina 2015): there is a satsifiability\npreserving translation from Coalition Logic to Propositional Dynamic\nLogic with Intersection (Gargov et al. 1988). This\ntranslation relies on the fact that for every non-injective game there\nis a (Coalition Logic) equivalent injective game.\n3.2.2 Non-monotonic Action Logics\n\nSome logics exploit a more compact representation of those relational\nstructures that correspond to non-cooperative games.\n\nRather than using effectivity functions, each player \\(i\\) is\nassociated with an equivalence relation \\(\\approx_i \\subseteq W\\times\nW\\), whose induced partition represent the choices he or she can\nperform. These equivalence relations describe the exact set of choices\nthat a group of players can perform and the originating models are\nreferred to as consequentialist in the literature (see for\ninstance Belnap, Perloff, & Ming 2001).\n\nNow define an effectivity function \\(E^{*}\\) for which it holds\nthat \n\\[E^{*}(i)= \\{[x] \\mid x' \\in [x] \\mbox{ whenever } x \\approx_i x' \\}^{+}\\]\n\n\nIntuitively \\(E^{*}(i)\\) collects what exactly the\nindividuals can achieve and all their supersets.\n\n\n\\(E^{*}\\) is called consequentialist if holds\nthat:\n\n\\(E^{*}(C)= \\{\\bigcap_{i\\in C} X_i \\mid \\mbox{for some } X_i \\in\nE^{*}(i)\\}\\)\n\\(\\emptyset\\not\\in E^{*}(C)\\) for each \\(C\\neq N\\)\n\\(E^{*}(N) = \\{\\{x\\} \\mid x \\in W\\}^{+}\\)\n\n\n\nNotice that \\(E^*\\) is a truly playable effectivity function.\n\nThe last property is well-foundedness, as in the case of arbitrary\neffectivity functions. This is not a property that is assumed in all\nvariants, e.g., the choice structures in Kooi & Tamminga 2008 and\nits temporal variant STIT (Belnap et al. 2001) do not.\nHowever, as observed in Turrini 2012 and Tamminga 2013, well-founded\nconsequentialist models correspond to non-cooperative games and the\neffectivity function \\(E\\) can be effectively simulated by the\nequivalence relation \\(\\approx_i\\) for each player. Intuitively\n\\(E^{*}(i)\\) is the set of sets of outcomes that \\(i\\) can choose\nwithout being able to refine further.\n\nTo reason about consequentialist models, we use so-called\nconsequentialist logics, i.e., propositional logic extended with\nmodalities of the form \\([C]\\varphi\\), interpreted as follows:\n\n\\(M,w \\models [C]\\varphi\\) if and only if \\(M,w'\\models \\varphi\\) for\nall \\(w'\\) such that \\(w (\\bigcap_{i \\in C} \\approx_i)w'\\)\n\nConsequentialist logics have been developed to reason about action and\nconsequence, and have interesting applications in deontic logic, such\nas Kooi & Tamminga 2008; Tamminga 2013; Turrini 2012. They are\nmoreover the basis of temporal logics of strategy such as STIT and\nstrategic STIT, discussed later. A special case are the logics of\npropositional control (Hoek & Wooldridge 2005; Troquard, Hoek,\n& Wooldridge 2009).\n3.2.3 Quantified and Higher-order Coalition Logic\n\nMany interesting properties of power in games involve quantifying over\ncoalitions, for example the notion of agent \\(i\\) being a weak\nveto player (Wooldridge and Dunne 2004) with respect to \\(\\phi\\),\nin the sense that any coalition that can enforce \\(\\phi\\) must include\n\\(i\\), or, in some first or higher-order extension of Coalition Logic:\n\\(\\forall C ([C]\\phi \\rightarrow i \\in C)\\). Quantified Coalition\nLogic (QCL) (\u00c5gotnes et al. 2008) extends\nCoalition Logic with a limited form of quantification over coalitions,\nwithout making the resulting logic undecidable or indeed increasing\nthe computational complexity of the satisfiability problem. In QCL\ncoalitions inside modalities are replaced with coalition predicates.\nIntuitively, \\([P]\\phi\\) (\\(\\langle P \\rangle \\phi\\)) means that any\n(some) coalition satisfying the predicate \\(P\\) has the ability to\nenforce \\(\\phi\\). As an example, \\(i\\) is a weak veto player for\n\\(\\phi\\): \n\\[ \\neg \\langle \\neg supseteq(\\{i\\})\\rangle \\phi \\]\n\n\n\u2013 it is not the case that any coalition that is not a superset\nof \\(\\{i\\}\\) has the power to enforce \\(\\phi\\). Or that \\(i\\) is a\ndictator for \\(\\phi\\): \\(\\neg \\langle \\neg\nsupseteq(\\{i\\})\\rangle \\phi \\wedge [supseteq(\\{i\\})]\\phi\\).\nSuch properties, and indeed all properties that can be expressed in\nQCL, can already be expressed in Coalition Logic, by using disjunction\nand conjunction to quantify over coalitions, but those expressions\nwould typically be exponentially long in the number of agents. QCL can\nexpress such properties concisely, and indeed is exponentially more\nsuccinct than Coalition Logic. QCL can also be further extended with\nBelief-Intention-Desire (BDI) logic (Chen et al. 2014)\nwithout increasing complexity.\n\nHigher-order Coalition Logic (HCL) (Boella et al.\n2010) extends QCL with to a monadic second-order language, unifying\nthe languages for describing coalitions and for describing their power\nand significantly extending the expressive power. Expressive tractable\nfragments of HCL exist (Doherty et al. 2011).\n3.2.4 Probabilities and Resource Bounds\n\nAs we have seen, the (truly playable) effectivity functions of\nCoalition Logic correspond to games where a joint strategy profile for\nthe set of all agents uniquely determines the outcome. Colition Logic\ncan be modified in several ways (Naumov et al. 2021) to deal\nwith stochastic games, i.e., where such a profile only\ndetermines a probability distribution over the set of possible\noutcomes. Having modalities \\([C]_p \\phi\\) interpreted as \"\\(C\\) can\nenforce \\(\\phi\\) with probability \\(p\\)\" leads to interesting and\nnon-trivial (in)valid properties, such as the following variant of\nsuperadditivity \\((C \\cap C' = \\emptyset)\\) \n\\[ [C]_p(\\phi\\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow\n([C']_q \\phi \\rightarrow [C \\cup C']_{max\\{p,q\\}} \\psi) \\]\n\n\nnot being valid, while \n\\[ [N]_{p+q+r}(\\phi \\vee \\psi\\vee \\sigma)\n\\rightarrow [N]_{2p}(\\phi \\vee \\psi) \\vee [N]_{2q}(\\psi \\vee \\sigma)\n\\vee [N]_{2r} (\\phi \\vee \\sigma) \\]\n\n\n(where \\(N\\) is the set of all agents) is valid.\n\nAs an alternative to stochastic transitions, games with stochastic\nfailures can be considerered, which from a logical viewpoint\nare somewhat easier to deal with (Naumov et al. 2021).\nInterpreting \\([C]_p \\phi\\) as \"\\(C\\) can has a joint strategy to\nensure that \\(\\phi\\) is true in each outcome and which is guaranteed\nnot to fail with probability at least \\(p\\) no matter what the other\nagents do\", we get, e.g., that the variant of the superadditivity\naxiom mentioned above holds.\n\nResource bounds have also been added to coalitional\nmodalities, interpreted in coalition models corresponding to games\nwith costs on performing joint actions (Alechina et al.\n2009). Here, \\([C^b]\\phi\\) means that \\(C\\) can force \\(\\phi\\) to be\ntrue under resource bound \\(b\\), i.e., that they can chose a joint\naction costing at most \\(b\\) that will ensure that \\(\\phi\\) is true.\nThese modalities satisfy the following variant of superadditivity \\((C\n\\cap D = \\emptyset, C \\neq \\emptyset, D \\neq \\emptyset)\\):\n\n\\[ [C^b]\\phi \\wedge [D^d]\\psi \\rightarrow [(C \\cup D)^{b+d}](\\phi \\wedge \\psi). \\]\n\n3.2.5 Conditional Power and Coordination\n\nFrom the viewpoints of truly playable effectivity functions and\nCoalition Logic, two games are equivalent if coalitions have the same\npower as defined by \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity. Van Benthem et\nal. 2019 point out, however, that there are meaningful\ndifferences between games with same \\(\\alpha\\)-effectivity, due to\nmonotonicity: \\(\\{w,v\\} \\in E(C)\\) might be the case for two\ndifferent reasons. First, it might be that there is a joint action by\n\\(C\\) such that there is a joint action by the other agents such that\nthe outcome will be \\(w\\) and there is another joint action\nby the other agents such that the outcome will be \\(v\\), or, second,\nit might be that that is true for only \\(w\\) or \\(v\\) (in\nwhich case \\(\\{w\\} \\in E(C)\\) or \\(\\{v\\} \\in E(C)\\)). The first kind\nof power is called basic power by van Benthem et al.\n2019, who characterise the properties of effectivity functions of\nbasic power in the two-agent case and gives a sound and complete\naxiomatisation using a variant of Instantial Neighbourhood Logic (INL)\n(van Benthem et al. 2010) which again is an extension of\nstandard modal logic with neighborhood semantics. One significance of\nbasic power is that it captures all the outcome sets in which the\nother players are free to chose any state, given the choice of one of\nthose outcome states for some coalition.\n\nSeveral extensions of the Coalition Logic language have also been\ndeveloped to reason about conditional and inter-related power between\nagents and coalitions, typically combining existential and universal\nquantification over choices. Goranko and Enqvist 2018 introduce\nextended coalition operators of the form \n\\[ [C](\\phi; \\psi_1, \\ldots, \\psi_k) \\]\n\n\nwith the intuitive meaning that \\(C\\) has the power to make \\(\\phi\\)\ntrue while at the same time making it possible that the other agents\nat the same time can achieve any of the objectives \\(\\psi_1,\\ldots,\n\\psi_k\\). The resulting logic can also be seen as a multi-agent\nextension of INL. Goranko and Enqvist 2018 also introduce operators of\nthe form \n\\[ [C_1\\triangleright\\phi_1, \\ldots, C_n\\triangleright \\phi_n] \\]\n\n\nwith the intuitive meaning that the coalition \\(C = C_1 \\cup \\cdots\nC_n\\) has a joint strategy such that, for each \\(i\\), the restriction\nof that joint strategy to coalition \\(C_i\\) enforces objective\n\\(\\phi_i\\).\n\nGoranko and Ju 2022 notice that the latter type of operator can be\nused to express a certain kind of conditional power, namely\n\\([A \\triangleright \\phi, A \\cup B \\triangleright \\psi]\\), intuitively\nsaying that \\(A\\) have a joint action that enforces \\(\\phi\\) while at\nthe same time enables \\(B\\) to apply a joint action that will enforce\n\\(\\psi\\). They also introduce two additional conditional power\nmodalities: \n\\[ [A]_\\alpha(\\phi; \\langle B\\rangle\\psi) \\text{ and } [A]_\\beta(\\phi; \\langle B\\rangle\\psi) \\]\n\n\nwhere the former says that \\(B \\setminus A\\) have a joint strategy\nsuch that if \\(A\\) applies any action that ensures \\(\\phi\\), then that\njoint strategy (by \\(B\\setminus A\\)) at the same time ensures\n\\(\\psi\\), and the latter that for any joint action by \\(A\\) that\nenforces \\(\\phi\\) there is a consistent joint action by \\(B\\) that at\nthe same time enforces \\(\\psi\\). These notions of power correspond to\n\\(\\alpha\\)- and \\(\\beta\\)- effectivity, respectively.\n\nCoordination is an issue not only between different coalitions, but\nalso between the agents in the coalition \\(C\\) in the interpretation\nof \\([C]\\phi\\). In Coalition Logic it is implicitly assumed, like it\noften is (Schelling 1960), that the agents in \\(C\\) somehow can\ncoordinate their actions to achieve the outcome \\(\\phi\\). Hawke 2017\nintroduces a new variant of the coalition modalities that captures a\nstronger notion of coalitional ability, relaxes the assumption about\ncoordination (in the case of two agents). Contrary to \\([C],\\) these\nnew modalities \\(((C))\\) are not monotonic.\n3.2.6 Dynamic Coalition Logic\n\nInspired by the model update semantics of\n dynamic epistemic logic,\n Coalition Logic has been extended in several ways with dynamic\nmodalities modeling changes in the ability of coalitions in different\nways. Broersen, Meyer and Turrini 2009 add expressions of the form\n\\([C \\downarrow \\psi]\\phi\\) with the intuitive meaning that after\n\\(C\\) chooses \\(\\psi\\), \\(\\phi\\) holds. \u00c5gotnes and Galimullin\n2021 add modalities for adding and removing actions and ability,\ninspired by arrow update logic: \\([(\\phi,a,\\psi)^+]\\gamma\\)\nintuitively means that after the coalition model is updated by, in\neach \\(\\phi\\)-state, adding a new action for agent \\(a\\) such that no\nmatter what the other agents do that action will guarantee \\(\\psi\\),\nthen \\(\\gamma\\) holds. There are similar modalities for removing\nability. \u00c5gotnes and Galimullin 2023 extend Coalition Logic with\nmore general and expressive modalities for coalitional action\nmodels, inspired by epistemic action models.\n3.2.7 Logic-Based Games\n\nIn many situations agents have control over certain propositional\nvariables (Hoek & Wooldridge 2005), for instance they can be\nresponsible for traffic flow or they can veto a certain issue.\nVariables can also be shared (Gerbrandy 2006), an example being\nvoting, where players share control over a variable whose realization\nis determined by a certain aggregation function, e.g., majority\n(Troquard, Hoek, & Wooldridge 2011). These logics of\npropositional control specify what propositions agents have\nin their effectivity function. For instance, if agent \\(i\\) controls\n\\(p\\), then both \\(p^{M}\\) and \\(\\neg p^{M}\\) are in his or her\neffectivity function. In a way these models are very special types of\neffectivity function, and what agents control can be seen as a choice,\nor a strategy, available to them.\n\nLogics for propositional control have modalities of the type\n\\([[i]]\\varphi\\), meaning that player \\(i\\) has a\n\u201ccontrol\u201d strategy to see to it that, no matter how the\nother agents choose their control strategies, then \\(\\varphi\\) holds\nin the end. But they also have modalities of the type\n\\([[C]]\\varphi\\), meaning that players in \\(C\\) have a joint control\nstrategy ensuring \\(\\varphi\\) in the end. A strategy profile is thus\nequivalent to a valuation function, which assigns a truth value of\nevery proposition available. In turn, a strategy of a player \\(i\\) can\nthus be seen as a partial valuation function, that assigns a truth\nvalue only to the propositions controlled by \\(i\\).\n\nSlightly abusing notation, we say that a valuation \\(V\\) satisfies a\nformula \\(\\varphi\\), denoted \\(V \\models \\varphi\\), whenever it makes\n\\(\\varphi\\) true under the current assignment of propositions. In\nother words, propositional control games are played in one single\nworld, and the individual assignments determine what propositions are\ntrue are that world. Denoting \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) the set of all\nvaluations and \\(\\mathcal{V}_i\\) to the partial ones under the control\nof \\(i\\) we have the following.\n\n\\((F,V) \\models [[C]]\\varphi\\) if and only if for all \\(i \\in C\\),\nthere exists \\(V'_i \\in \\mathcal{V}_i\\) such that, for all \\(k \\in\n\\overline{C}, V'_{k}\\in \\mathcal{V}_k\\), we have that \\((F,V')\\models\n\\varphi\\)\n\nSo when \\([[C]]\\varphi\\) holds, coalition \\(C\\) can play a control\nstrategy in such a way that no matter what the control strategy is\nthat their opponents play, the resulting outcome satisfies\n\\(\\varphi\\).\n\nLogics for propositional control can be extended to goal-based\nformalisms, the so called Boolean games (Harrenstein, van der Hoek,\nMeyer, & Witteveen 2001): propositions are partitioned among the\nplayers, with each player controlling the set of propositions he or\nshe is assigned to. On top of that each player is also assigned a\nformula of propositional logic which is meant to be his or her goal\nand whose realization might not only depend upon the choices he or she\nis able to make.\n\nBoolean games have been extensively studied in the field of\nmulti-agent systems, as simple and compact models to represent\nstrategic interaction in a logic-based setting (Dunne & Hoek 2004;\nDunne & Wooldridge 2012; Dunne, Hoek, Kraus, & Wooldridge\n2008).\n\nIn their most general variants they are an extension of logics with\npropositional control, where each agent is assigned a goal formula.\nThe goal formula is a satisfiable formula of the language and the\nimportant feature is that the goal of each agent does not need to be\nunder his or her control.\n\nFor instance, agent \\(i\\) may be assigned the control of proposition\n\\(p\\) only, but might have the goal that \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\). So\nwhether \\(i\\)\u2019s goal is satisfied depends not only on \\(i\\)\nsetting proposition \\(p\\) to be true, but also some other agent, say\n\\(j\\), setting proposition \\(q\\) to be true. Agent \\(j\\), on the other\nhand, might or might not be interested in having \\(q\\) set to true.\nFor instance he or she may want proposition \\(r\\) to be true, and\ntherefore being indifferent to whether \\(q\\) or \\(\\overline{q}\\) is\nrealized in the end. Or might even have the goal that\n\\(\\overline{q}\\).\n\nIn Boolean games some objectives can be realized all together, for\ninstance agents might all want \\(p \\vee \\neg q\\) to be true, or it\nmight be the case that certain valuations do not realize the\nobjectives of all agents, but no unhappy agent is able to improve his\nor her own situation by changing the assignment to the propositional\nvariables he or she controls. This situation is a very simple form of\nNash equilibrium that can be expressed in Boolean games.\n\nSo, for \\(\\gamma_i\\) being the objective of player \\(i\\) and \\(v_i\\) a\npartial valuation that is under control of player \\(i\\), we say that\nvaluation \\(v\\) is a Nash equilibrium if we have that for each \\(i\\)\nand each \\(v'_i\\). \n\\[(v_i,v_{-i}) \\not\\models\\gamma_i \\mbox{ implies that } (v'_i,v_{-i})\n\\not\\models\\gamma_i\\]\n\n\nSo if \\(v\\) does not satisfy \\(i\\)\u2019s goal, there is nothing\n\\(i\\) can do to satisfy it.\n\nThe analysis of Nash equilibria in Boolean game shows a close\ncorrespondence between these games and propositional logic: using a\nreduction to the satisfiability problem of propositional logic\nformulas, the problem of checking whether an outcome \\(v\\) is a Nash\nequilibrium of a Boolean game is co-NP complete (Wooldridge, Endriss,\nKraus, & Lang 2013).\n\nAnother common approach to concisely representing certain classes of\ngames, in addition to representing payoffs qualitatively, is to impose\nrestrictions on the payoff functions. An approach combining the two is\nfound in Das et al. 2023, in which Monadic Least Fixed Point\nlogic is used to express the existence of pure strategy Nash\nequilibria for games with pairwise separable payoff functions.\n4. Conclusions: On the Right Level of Analysis\n\nRecall the very first example, in which the set of outcomes of a\nvoting game could be described only considering the overall outcome of\nthe vote or by explicitly describing what each of the Countries had\nvoted.\n\nOften times, when describing mathematical structures by succinct\nlanguages we are confronted with the question of which one is the most\nsuitable language. Some are able to express preferences, knowledge and\ncoalitional ability all together, some others only two of these,\nsome others only one. Finally some languages might only be able\nto express what individuals, and not coalitions, can achieve.\n\nAgain, there is no right answer to this question. It all depends on\nwhat the fundamental characteristics are that one is trying to model.\nTo express Nash equilibria in a coordination game, there is no need\nfor a temporal logic-based formalism. On the contrary, if one wants to\nexpress backwards induction, then a language that does not make the\nsequential structure of the decision problem explicit is probably not\nthe right one.\n\nGoing back to our example, some Countries might have preferences over\nhow other Countries vote, and this might affect their decision-making,\nchanging the overall equilibrium points of the game. If this is the\ncase then the richer language matters. Otherwise, if we can safely\nrule out this possibility, the more succinct language seems to be the\nappropriate choice.",
