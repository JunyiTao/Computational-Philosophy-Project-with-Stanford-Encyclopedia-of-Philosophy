    "main_text": "The Origin of the Specifically Medieval Problem of Universals\n3. The Origin of the Specifically Medieval Problem of Universals\n\nWhat we may justifiably call the first formulation of \u201cthe\nmedieval problem of universals\u201d (distinguishing it from\nthe both logically and historically related ancient problems of\nPlato\u2019s Theory of Forms) was precisely such a bundle of\nquestions famously raised by Porphyry in his Isagoge, that\nis, his Introduction to Aristotle\u2019s Categories. As he\nwrote:\n\n(1) Since, Chrysaorius, to teach about Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories it is necessary to know what genus and difference\nare, as well as species, property, and accident, and since reflection\non these things is useful for giving definitions, and in general for\nmatters pertaining to division and demonstration, therefore I shall\ngive you a brief account and shall try in a few words, as in the\nmanner of an introduction, to go over what our elders said about these\nthings. I shall abstain from deeper enquiries and aim, as appropriate,\nat the simpler ones.\n\n\n(2) For example, I shall beg off saying anything about (a) whether\ngenera and species are real or are situated in bare thoughts alone,\n(b) whether as real they are bodies or incorporeals, and (c) whether\nthey are separated or in sensibles and have their reality in\nconnection with them. Such business is profound, and requires another,\ngreater investigation. Instead I shall now try to show how the\nancients, the Peripatetics among them most of all, interpreted genus\nand species and the other matters before us in a more logical fashion.\n[Porphyry, Isagoge, in Spade 1994 (henceforth, Five\nTexts), p. 1.]\n\n\nEven though in this way, by relegating them to a \u201cgreater\ninvestigation\u201d, Porphyry left these questions unanswered, they\ncertainly proved to be irresistible for his medieval Latin\ncommentators, beginning with Boethius, who produced not just one, but\ntwo commentaries on Porphyry\u2019s text; the first based on Marius\nVictorinus\u2019s (fl. 4th c.) translation, and\nthe second on his\n own.[6]\n\nIn the course of his argument, Boethius makes it quite clear what sort\nof entity a universal would have to be.\n\nA universal must be common to several particulars\n\n\nin its entirety, and not only in part\nsimultaneously, and not in a temporal succession, and\nit should constitute the substance of its\n particulars.[7]\n\n\n\nHowever, as Boethius argues, nothing in real existence can satisfy\nthese conditions. The main points of his argument can be reconstructed\nas follows.\n\nAnything that is common to many things in the required manner has to\nbe simultaneously, and as a whole, in the substance of these many\nthings. But these many things are several beings precisely because\nthey are distinct from one another in their being, that is to say, the\nact of being of one is distinct from the act of being of the other.\nHowever, if the universal constitutes the substance of a particular,\nthen it has to have the same act of being as the particular, because\nconstituting the substance of something means precisely this, namely,\nsharing the act of being of the thing in question, as the\nthing\u2019s substantial part. But the universal is supposed to\nconstitute the substance of all of its distinct particulars, as a\nwhole, at the same time. Therefore, the one act of being of the\nuniversal entity would have to be identical with all the distinct acts\nof being of its several particulars at the same time, which is\n impossible.[8]\n\nThis argument, therefore, establishes that no one thing can be a\nuniversal in its being, that is to say, nothing can be both one being\nand common to many beings in such a manner that it shares its act of\nbeing with those many beings, constituting their substance.\n\nThis can easily be visualized in the following diagram, where the tiny\nlightning bolts indicate the acts of being of the entities involved,\nnamely, a woman, a man, and their universal humanity (the larger\ndotted figure).\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of the first part\nof Boethius\u2019 argument\n\n\nBut then, Boethius goes on, we should perhaps say that the universal\nis not one being, but rather many beings, that is, [the collection\n of][9]\n those constituents of the individual essences of its particulars on\naccount of which they all fall under the same universal predicable.\nFor example, on this conception, the genus \u2018animal\u2019 would\nnot be some one entity, a universal animality over and above the\nindividual animals, yet somehow sharing its being with them all\n(since, as we have just seen, that is impossible), but rather [the\ncollection of] the individual animalities of all animals.\n\nBoethius rejects this suggestion on the ground that whenever there are\nseveral generically similar entities, they have to have a genus;\ntherefore, just as the individual animals had to have a genus, so too,\ntheir individual animalities would have to have another one. However,\nsince the genus of animalities cannot be one entity, some\n\u2018super-animality\u2019 (for the same reason that the genus of\nanimals could not be one entity, on the basis of the previous\nargument), it seems that the genus of animalities would have to be a\nnumber of further \u2018super-animalities\u2019. But then again, the\nsame line of reasoning should apply to these\n\u2018super-animalities\u2019, giving rise to a number of\n\u2018super-super-animalities\u2019, and so on to infinity, which is\nabsurd. Therefore, we cannot regard the genus as some real being even\nin the form of [a collection of] several distinct entities. Since\nsimilar reasonings would apply to the other Porphyrian predicables as\nwell, no universal can exist in this way.\n\nNow, a universal either exists in reality independently of a mind\nconceiving of it, or it only exists in the mind. If it exists in\nreality, then it either has to be one being or several beings. But\nsince it cannot exist in reality in either of these two ways, Boethius\nconcludes that it can only exist in the\n mind.[10]\n\nHowever, to complicate matters, it appears that a universal cannot\nexist in the mind either. For, as Boethius says, the universal\nexisting in the mind is some universal understanding of some thing\noutside the mind. But then this universal understanding is either\ndisposed in the same way as the thing is, or differently. If it is\ndisposed in the same way, then the thing also must be universal, and\nthen we end up with the previous problem of a really existing\nuniversal. On the other hand, if it is disposed differently, then it\nis false, for \u201cwhat is understood otherwise than the thing is is\nfalse\u201d (Five Texts, Spade 1994, p. 23 (21)). But then,\nall universals in the understanding would have to be false\nrepresentations of their objects; therefore, no universal knowledge\nwould be possible, whereas our considerations started out precisely\nfrom the existence of such knowledge, as seems to be clear, e.g., in\nthe case of geometrical knowledge.\n",
