    "main_text": "The Rationality of Voting\n1. The Rationality of Voting\n\nThe act of voting has an opportunity cost. It takes time and effort\nthat could be used for other valuable things, such as working for pay,\nvolunteering at a soup kitchen, or playing video games. Further,\nidentifying issues, gathering political information, thinking or\ndeliberating about that information, and so on, also take time and\neffort which could be spent doing other valuable things. Economics, in\nits simplest form, predicts that rational people will perform an\nactivity only if doing so maximizes expected utility. However,\neconomists have long worried that, that for nearly every individual\ncitizen, voting does not maximize expected utility. This leads to the\n\u201cparadox of voting\u201d(Downs 1957): Since the expected costs\n(including opportunity costs) of voting appear to exceed the expected\nbenefits, and since voters could always instead perform some action\nwith positive overall utility, it\u2019s surprising that anyone\nvotes.\n\nHowever, whether voting is rational or not depends on just what voters\nare trying to do. Instrumental theories of the rationality of voting\nhold that it can be rational to vote when the voter\u2019s goal is to\ninfluence or change the outcome of an election, including the\n\u201cmandate\u201d the winning candidate receives. (The mandate\ntheory of elections holds that a candidate\u2019s effectiveness in\noffice, i.e., her ability to get things done, is in part a function of\nhow large or small a lead she had over her competing candidates during\nthe election.) In contrast, the expressive theory of voting holds that\nvoters vote in order to express themselves and their fidelity to\ncertain groups or ideas. Alternatively, one might hold that voting is\nrational because it is has consumption value; many people enjoy\npolitical participation for its own sake or for being able to show\nothers that they voted. Finally, if one believes, as most democratic\ncitizens say they do (Mackie 2010), that voting is a substantial moral\nobligation, then voting could be rational because it is necessary to\ndischarge one\u2019s obligation.\n",
