    "main_text": "The Later Theory of Religion\n6. The Later Theory of Religion\n\nFeuerbach is most often associated with the slogan underlying The\nEssence of Christianity, according to which \u201ctheology is\nanthropology\u201d (insofar as the predicates attributed by\nChristians to God are in fact predicates of the human\nspecies-essence). In a number of works on religion published in the\n1840s and 1850s, however, Feuerbach advanced explanations of the\norigin of religious concepts and beliefs that are strikingly different\nfrom, and apparently at odds with, the more familiar position put\nforward in that book. The works in which Feuerbach advanced these new\ntheoretical initiatives include the previously referenced Luther book\n(1844), a short book entitled The Essence of Religion (1846),\nthe essay, \u201cBelief in Immortality from the Standpoint of\nAnthropology\u201d (1847), the Lectures on the Essence of\nReligion originally delivered in 1848\u20139, but first\npublished in 1851 (hereafter Lectures), and the\nTheogony (1857). The question of the relationship between the\naccount of religion contained in The Essence of Christianity\nand the views put forward in these later writings is a complex one.\nThe most thorough investigation of this question is to be found in\nHarvey (1995), where Harvey distinguishes five different\n\u201cexplanatory principles\u201d employed by Feuerbach in The\nEssence of Christianity, among which he divides those that are\nconceived along Hegelian lines from those that tend instead toward the\n\u201cexistentialist-naturalist\u201d themes which predominate in\nFeuerbach\u2019s later writings on religion (Harvey 1995:\n68\u201369). Harvey\u2019s thesis is that, in his later writings,\nFeuerbach in fact develops an alternative, bipolar model of religion\nthat is both incompatible with, and more compelling than, the more\nfamiliar theory presented in The Essence of Christianity.\nWhereas, in that work, Feuerbach had proposed that God is an alienated\nprojection of the human species-essence to whom the\n\u201cperfections\u201d of the latter are mistakenly attributed, the\nnew bipolar model seeks instead to explain the origin and persistence\nof religious beliefs and practices, Christian and non-Christian alike,\nin terms of their role in meeting deep-seated psychological needs\nresulting from the contingency and finitude of embodied human subjects\nseeking to preserve their existence and to expand their natural\npowers.\n\nIn a previously cited essay published in 1842, in which Feuerbach\nsought to clarify the differences between Hegel\u2019s philosophy of\nreligion and his own, he referred readers seeking to evaluate his\nargument in The Essence of Christianity to his\n\u201cCritique of the So-Called Positive Philosophy\u201d, published\nin the Halle Annals in December, 1838 (B 235). It\nwas there that Feuerbach first put forward the claim that all the\n\u201cdeterminations\u201d (Bestimmungen) ascribed by the\npositive philosophy to God are determinations either of \u201cthe\nessence of nature\u201d or of \u201cthe essence of man\u201d\n(KPP 204). This claim is consistent with subsequent\nstatements of Feuerbach\u2019s, including his observation in\nPrinciples that \u201cGod, in the theological sense, is God\nonly as long as he is conceived as a being distinguished from the\nbeing of man and nature\u201d (GPZ 280/19). Here the\nsuggestion seems to be that, if it can be shown that attributes\nascribed by theists to God are attributes derived either from human\nconsciousness or from nature, then it will have been shown that God\nhas no existence apart from the existence of human consciousness and\nof nature. Thus, even if it is true, as Harvey is probably correct to\nargue, that the bipolar model of religion found in the later writings\ndoes not merely supplement, but replaces, the position taken by\nFeuerbach in The Essence of Christianity, these two distinct\nexplanatory enterprises can nevertheless be understood as alternative\nstrategies for making good on Feuerbach\u2019s original claim that\nthe predicates of divinity can be reduced to predicates derived\neither from the essence of nature or from the human essence.\nIt should be noted that, while Harvey is correct in pointing out that\nthe human species-essence is rarely mentioned in Feuerbach\u2019s\nlater writings, by 1851 Feuerbach had nevertheless still not abandoned\nthe claim that God, conceived as a personal being distinct from\nnature, \u201cis nothing other than the deified and objectified\nspiritual essence of man\u201d (VWR 28/21).\n\nAs Rawidowicz (1964: 113) and Ascheri (1964: 62) have both observed,\nthe break with the speculative tradition that Feuerbach signaled in\nthe \u201cPreliminary Theses\u201d and in Principles\ncorresponds to a noticeable change in his stance toward religion, if\nnot in his estimation of the truth-value of traditional doctrinal\nclaims. In his polemical essays of the late 1830s, and in The\nEssence of Christianity, Feuerbach had unfavorably contrasted the\n\u201cegoistic\u201d, practical standpoint of religion, which he\nassociated with the unrestricted subjectivity of feeling\n(Gem\u00fct) and imagination (Phantasie), with the\nimpartial, theoretical standpoint of philosophy, which he associated\nwith reason and objectivity. At the end of Principles,\nhowever, he informs his readers that the new philosophy, without\nceasing to be theoretical, nevertheless has a fundamentally practical\ntendency, and that in this respect it \u201cassumes the place of\nreligion\u201d and \u201cis in truth itself religion\u201d\n(GPZ 341/73). This line of thought is developed somewhat\nfurther in an unpublished manuscript where Feuerbach observes that, in\norder to replace religion, philosophy must itself become religion in\nthe sense that \u201cit must, in a way suited to its own nature,\nincorporate the essence of religion or the advantage that religion\npossesses over philosophy\u201d (NV 123/148). Here,\nFeuerbach does not say what he takes religion\u2019s\n\u201cadvantage\u201d over philosophy to be, but in the\nLectures he claims that the difference between philosophy and\nreligion can be reduced to \u201cthe simple statement that religion\nis sensuous and aesthetic, while philosophy is nonsensuous and\nabstract\u201d (VWR 20/13). Religion\u2019s\n\u201cadvantage\u201d over the old philosophy, then, is presumably\nit\u2019s implicit acknowledgment of the \u201ctruth and\nessentiality of sensuousness\u201d and of human finitude, which it is\nthe task of the new philosophy to articulate explicitly.\n\nWhen Feuerbach\u2019s Luther book was first published in 1844, its\nsubtitle suggested that it was conceived of as an addendum to The\nEssence of Christianity. Because, in the first edition of that\nbook, Feuerbach had relied heavily on quotations from patristic and\nmedieval works to support his claims, some theological critics had\nretorted that, while Feuerbach\u2019s account of Christianity might\napply to Catholicism, it did not apply to Protestantism. It was in\nresponding to these critics that Feuerbach turned his attention to\nLuther, and, in doing so, introduced a number of concepts and themes\nthat had not figured prominently in The Essence of\nChristianity, but which he continued to develop in his later\nwritings, including both those devoted to religion, as well as those\ndevoted to other topics. Foremost among these concepts and themes are\nSeligkeit (blessedness or perfect happiness) and the\nGl\u00fcckseligkeitstrieb or drive-to-happiness; \u201chuman\negoism\u201d or human self-love; the feeling of dependence on nature;\nand the powerful, theogonic (i.e., god-originating) wish to be free\nfrom the limitations of nature by which the human drive-to-happiness\nis restricted.\n\nFeuerbach begins the Luther book by conceding that no doctrine would\nseem more clearly to contradict the central claim advanced in The\nEssence of Christianity, namely, that Christians worship the\nhuman species-essence, than does Luther\u2019s doctrine. That\ndoctrine seems, on the contrary, to be the epitome of human\nself-abnegation insofar as it emphasizes the depravity and\ncontemptibleness of human nature in contrast to the perfection and\nglory of the divine nature. This appearance, however, is deceptive, on\nFeuerbach\u2019s account; for, while it\u2019s true that, whatever\nLuther takes from human beings, he gives to God, since all that\nbelongs to God belongs to Christ, and all that belongs to Christ\nbelongs to the Christian, it is only on the surface that\nLuther\u2019s doctrine is dehumanizing. Whereas, in The Essence\nof Christianity, Feuerbach had contrasted the egoism and\nintolerance of faith (which he associated with the false, theological\nessence of religion) with the altruism and universality love (which he\nassociated with the true, human essence of religion), in the Luther\nbook he emphasizes instead that Christian faith is faith in a God who\nis love. Since, however, it is human beings who are the principal\nobject of this love, Luther\u2019s emphasis on the comptemptability\nof human nature turns out to be an indirect form of human self-love or\nself-affirmation. The Christian believer affirms the existence of, as\nwell as his or her confidence in, the goodness of God, who has\npromised him or her blessedness or freedom from the painful\nlimitations of mortality. It is only because the Christian believer\nthus \u201ccompletes and satisfies himself in God\u201d\n(WGL 363/46) that God is credited with the possession of all\nthat human beings lack. Luther, with his emphasis on God\u2019s being\npro nobis or \u201cfor us\u201d, was \u201cthe first to\nlet out the secret of the Christian faith\u201d (WGL\n366/50), which is, at bottom, the assurance\n\n\nthat God is by his very nature concerned with man, \u2026 that God\nis a being not for himself or against us, but rather for us, a good\nbeing, good to us men. (WGL 366\u201367/51)\n\n\nFrom this recognition, Feuerbach goes on to develop an analysis of the\ndivine attributes, which he interprets in this context as \u201cmeans\nto the end of benevolence\u201d (WGL 368/52). Here, and in\nFeuerbach\u2019s later writings, the concepts of blessedness and the\ndrive-to-happiness seem to play a role analogous to the one played by\nthe concept of the species-essence in The Essence of\nChristianity. Whereas, in the latter work, divine attributes such\nas omniscience and perfection were said to be attributes of the human\nspecies-essence, in the section on Seligkeit toward the end\nof the Theogony, where Feuerbach develops a line of thought\nfirst introduced in the Luther book, many of these same attributes are\nsaid to characterize the state of blessedness itself. \u201cGod is\nonly the foreword, blessedness the text of Christianity. Or: The\nmystery of divinity is first unveiled and revealed in the gospel of\nblessedness\u201d (T 308). The thesis here is that the\nattributes of the Christian God are determined by the most fundamental\nwishes of the Christian believer. For example, God qua\ncreator is first and foremost omnipotent, but omnipotence is ascribed\nto God only because it is necessary for God to be omnipotent in order\nfor God to be able to exercise his benevolence toward the faithful by\nsupplying them with what they lack, including eternal life. There is\nno lack that cannot be satisfied, and no ultimate harm that can\nbefall, the person who is the object of the benevolence of an\nomnipotent being. On this account, the divine attributes are\ndetermined by human needs. These are determined, in turn, by the\npsycho-physical constitution of human beings as self-conscious\nsubjects constrained by natural limitations from which they have an\nurgent wish to be liberated. In the final analysis, belief in divine\nomnipotence is said be motivated, not by any specific wish, but rather\nby \u201cthe unspecific over-all wish that there be in general no\nnatural necessity; no limitations, no opposition to the human being\nand to human wishes\u201d (WGL 372/59).\n\nFeuerbach, whose conception of Seligkeit or blessedness seems\nto have been influenced by Augustine\u2019s account of\nfelicitas in The City of God, defines blessedness at\none point as freedom from sin, sensual drives, \u201cthe oppression\nof matter\u201d, death, and the limitations of nature in general\n(WGL 403/103). Whereas the God of Christianity had previously\nbeen identified by Feuerbach as an alienated projection of the human\nspecies-essence, here God is defined instead as the realized\ndrive-to-happiness of the Christian believer. To say that belief in\nGod is motivated or caused by the human drive-to-happiness is not\nnecessarily to deny that attributes ascribed to God are attributes\nderived from human nature. It is, however, in any case to affirm that\nthe ascription to God of the perfections of the human species-essence\nserves an underlying psychological need that is itself determined by\nthe dependence of human beings upon nature, and their awareness of\nthis dependence in the form of powerful hopes and fears that give rise\nto belief in supernatural agencies and efforts to secure their\nblessings.\n\nTwo years after the publication of the Luther book, Feuerbach\npublished another short book entitled The Essence of\nReligion, the core ideas in which are further developed in the\nLectures. Here, Feuerbach explains that, because Christians\nthemselves do not worship such things as the sun and the moon, but\ninstead worship \u201cwill, intelligence, consciousness as divine\nbeings and powers\u201d (VWR 27/20), he himself had\n\u201cdisregarded nature\u201d in his account of Christianity\n(VWR, 26/19). This had given rise to certain unspecified but\n\u201cpreposterous\u201d misunderstandings which he sought to\ncorrect by augmenting the slogan encapsulating his doctrine from\n\u201ctheology is anthropology\u201d to \u201ctheology is\nanthropology \u2018and physiology\u2019\u201d\n(VWR 28/21). This modification reflects a new emphasis in\nFeuerbach\u2019s later writings on the ontological dependence of\nhuman consciousness upon the physical human organism, which itself\nexists only in relation to the natural order of which it is a\npart\u2014a relation mediated, or, to be more precise,\nrevealed, by the senses.\n\nThe Essence of Religion begins with the striking claims that\n1) the feeling of dependence is the \u201cground\u201d of religion,\nand that 2) the original object of this feeling, i.e., in the history\nof religion, is nature. Feuerbach defines the feeling of dependence\nas\n\n\nthe feeling or consciousness of man that he does not and cannot exist\napart from a being that is distinct from himself, that he does not\nhave himself to thank for his own existence. (WR 4)\n\n\nThis feeling can manifest itself negatively as fear, to which\nFeuerbach refers at one point as \u201ca feeling of dependency on an\nobject without which I am nothing, which has the power to destroy\nme\u201d (VWR 39/31); but the feeling of dependent can also\nmanifest itself positively in the form of celebratory joy and\nexaltation. Feuerbach finds both of these powerful emotions expressed\nin the act of sacrifice, which he takes to be the most characteristic\npractice of nature religions (as opposed, presumably, to prayer as the\ncharacteristic act of \u201cspiritual\u201d, i.e., monotheistic,\nreligions). In addition to filling a \u201cgap\u201d in the argument\nput forward in The Essence of Christianity by emphasizing the\ndependence of \u201cthe human essence\u201d upon \u201cthe essence\nof nature\u201d, Feuerbach also sought in The Essence of\nReligion to identify features shared in common by what he calls\n\u201cnature religions\u201d, on the one hand, and\n\u201cspiritual\u201d religions like Christianity, on the other, and\nto clarify the relationship between these two kinds of religion.\nFeuerbach uses the term \u201cnature religion\u201d to refer both\nthe pagan religions of classical antiquity, and the religions of\nvarious tribal peoples whose beliefs and practices were described for\nFeuerbach and his contemporaries by European travelers in journals\nsuch as Das Ausland, from which Feuerbach derived a number of\nthe examples to which he refers in this book (cf. Tomasoni 1990:\n10\u201311, 127\u2013135).\n\nWhile the feeling of dependence is said to be the \u201cground\u201d\nof religion, what the act of sacrifice aims at, or seeks to achieve,\nis freedom from the restrictions of nature, or, alternatively, human\nindependence. If blessedness is the condition of not being subjected\nto the restrictions imposed by nature on all finite, corporeal\nindividuals subject to generation and corruption, then human\nblessedness can be regarded as the final goal (Endzweck) of\nreligion (WR 34). The gods are the objects of worship, and\nthe recipients of sacrifice, because they are the benefactors of human\nbeings in the specific sense that they are imagined to have it in\ntheir power to satisfy fundamental human wishes, including the wish\nnot to die. \u201cOnly a being who loves man and desires his\nhappiness [Seligkeit] is an object of human worship, of\nreligion\u201d (VWR 71/60). The sacrificial act is motivated\nby the experience of need (Bed\u00fcrfnis), which involves\nthe simultaneous awareness both of one\u2019s \u201cnon-being apart\nfrom nature\u201d, and of one\u2019s existence as a self-conscious\nbeing distinct from nature (WR 32). In the Lectures,\nFeuerbach claims that the feeling of dependence on nature is the only\n\u201ctruly universal\u201d designation for the \u201cpsychological\nor subjective ground of religion\u201d (VWR 39/31). This\ncontinues to be the case even after nature has ceased to be the locus\nof divinity, and the origin of the visible world is sought in the will\nof a transcendent creator who brought forth the world into being from\nnothing, and who is solely responsible for occurrences attributed by\npolytheists to a multitude of divine agencies. The objective\ncorrelates of the feeling of dependence, in the case of both\npolytheism and monotheism, are the really existing things and people\nwho are the objects of various human needs, physical and\npsychological, at least some of which Feuerbach implicitly recognizes,\nespecially in the Theogony, to be culturally determined.\n\nFeuerbach\u2019s description of the feeling of dependence as\ninvolving the awareness\n\n\nthat I am nothing without a not-I which is distinct from me\nyet intimately related to me, something other, which is at\nthe same time my own being (VWR 350/311)\n\n\nreflects his understanding of nature as the totality of \u201cthe\nbeings [Wesen], things, [and] objects that man distinguishes\nfrom himself and his products\u201d (WR 4). Nature, in other\nwords, is coterminous with the non-human world, devoid of\nconsciousness, will and sentiment. It includes such things as light,\nelectricity, air, water, earth, and the plants and animals upon which\nthe existence of human beings depends, but it also includes the human\norganism itself insofar as the effects produced by that organism are\nproduced unconsciously and involuntary. Nature is the \u201ccause and\nground of man\u201d; in human beings nature \u201cbecomes a\npersonal, conscious, intelligent (verst\u00e4ndiges)\nbeing\u201d (VWR 29/21). To say that human beings are\ndependent upon nature is to say, among other things, that nature,\nwhich is devoid of consciousness and intention, is what has caused\nhuman beings to exist, and that the same physical processes that have\nproduced the human brain have also produced human consciousness. While\nall organisms are dependent upon nature for their existence, human\nbeings are distinguished from other organisms by the extent of their\nconscious awareness of this dependence. This awareness Feuerbach finds\nexpressed in the earliest forms of cultic activity, including the\nearliest forms of nature religion focused, for example, on the changes\nof the seasons, and in the offering of sacrifice to divine beings\nassociated with various aspects of the natural world. Although nature\nis the original object of religion, this goes unrecognized initially\nbecause human beings do not at first distinguish themselves from\nnature or vice versa. The forces of nature are instead personified,\nand naturally occurring events are attributed to the human-like\nmotivations of spirits and gods. Religion, according to Feuerbach,\nexhibits the following contradiction: When it conceives of itself\ntheistically, it mistakenly thinks of God as a thoroughly non-human\nbeing (i.e., one whose existence and attributes in no way depends on\nthe existence and attributes of human beings), and when in conceives\nof itself as nature religion, it mistakenly attributes consciousness\nand will to what is in fact entirely non-human.\n\nFurther analysis of the feeling of the dependence leads Feuerbach to\nconclude that this feeling itself presupposes \u201cegoism as the\nultimate hidden ground of religion\u201d (VWR\n91\u201392/79). Here he reasons that, if human beings were not\nsubject to powerful psychological drives which compel them to expand\nand develop their natural powers, including most fundamentally the\ndrive-to-self-preservation, they would not experience the limitations\nimposed upon them by nature as painful and restricting.\n\u201cLife is egoism\u201d (EEWR 82)\ninsofar as the fundamental drive of all living things, including the\nhuman organism, is the drive to self-preservation\n(Selbsterhaltungstrieb). Nevertheless, what Feuerbach calls\n\u201chuman egoism\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to be the same thing\neither as psychological egoism (the claim that everyone always acts\nfrom self-interest) or ethical egoism (the claim that\n\u201cgood\u201d is whatever serves my own interests). Feuerbach\nwrites that, by \u201chuman egoism\u201d he means\n\n\nman\u2019s love for himself, that is, love of the human essence, the\nlove that spurs him on to satisfy and develop all the impulses and\ntendencies without whose satisfaction and development he neither is\nnor can be a true, complete human being. (VWR\n60\u201361/50)\n\n\nThis type of self-love, which warrants comparison with, but is not the\nsame as, Rousseau\u2019s amour de soi, encompasses love of\none\u2019s fellow human beings, apart from whom one cannot either\ncultivate or satisfy the ethical, intellectual and aesthetic impulses\nand capacities in which one\u2019s essential humanity consists, and\nto whose well-being one\u2019s own is thus inextricably linked.\n\nFeuerbach\u2019s book, Theogony according to the Sources of\nClassical, Hebrew and Christian Antiquity (1857), which is the\nproduct of six years of close engagement with Hebrew, Greek, and Latin\ntexts from antiquity, exemplifies the vastness of Feuerbach\u2019s\nhumanistic erudition. Feuerbach considered it his \u201csimplest,\nmost complete, mature work\u201d (GW 20: 292). It may not be\na mere coincidence that the period of Feuerbach\u2019s engagement in\nthese philological labors was the same period when one of his closest\ncorrespondents was Emil Ernst Gottfried von Herder, the son of Johann\nGottfried von Herder, whose introduction to the study of theology\nFeuerbach had read as a young man while he himself was learning Hebrew\ngrammar in preparation for his matriculation in the theological\nfaculty at the University of Heidelberg. Like the older Herder, who\nconceived of the poetry of the Hebrew Bible as a product of the genius\nof humanity in its childhood, Feuerbach turned to the Iliad\nand the Odyssey, which he thought of as the\nUrst\u00e4tten or \u201coriginal sites\u201d of\nanthropology, and to the Hebrew scriptures, for clues to the origins\nof belief in the gods and in God. Large portions of the book consist\neither of 1) careful philological analyses of individual passages\nselected, for example, from the Iliad or the\nOdyssey, or from the creation accounts in Genesis, or else of\na verse from Pindar or Ovid, or a passage from the New Testament; or\n2) quotations from a wide range of Greco-Roman, patristic, rabbinical\nand medieval sources which Feuerbach cites in support of the central\nexplanatory claim of the book. This claim is that the psychological\norigin of belief in the gods and in God is the powerful human wish for\nhappiness or blessedness conceived as a state of freedom from the\n\u201climitations\u201d (Grenze) that nature imposes on\nhuman existence, which are experienced by the human subject in the\nform of powerful feelings of hope and fear.\n\nIn seeking to substantiate the claim that the wish is the fundamental\nreligious phenomenon, Feuerbach analyzes several theophanies from the\nIliad in an effort to show that the gods make their\nappearances in the epic in response to petitions directed to them by\nhumans. Insofar as the ends toward which the actions of the gods in\nthe Homeric epics are directed are determined by the wishes of the\nmortals who invoke their blessings and curses, the gods act as the\nrepresentatives or deputies of (Vertreter) of human self-love\n(T 12). \u201cThe wish is a slave of necessity, but a slave\nwith the will to freedom\u201d (T 47), and the gods are the\nimaginary embodiment of human freedom from the restrictions of\nfinitude. Feuerbach arrives at this conclusion through his analysis of\nacts of petitionary prayer in the Iliad and their role in\nwish fulfillment, and cites in this context the observation of the\nByzantine Homeric commentator, Eustathius of Thessalonica, that Homer\nallows no just request made of the gods to remain unfulfilled. In the\ndivine-human relationship, it is the mortals who desire, strive, and\nwill; and it is the gods who complete or bring to fruition these human\nintentions to the extent that the conditions for their satisfaction\nare beyond human control (T 19). While the wish itself is a\npurely subjective psychological occurrence, the completion of the\naction to which a wish might give rise, or the achievement of the end\ntoward which the wish is directed, depends upon external circumstances\nthat may or may not be conducive to the fulfillment of the wish.\nAnticipating a similar observation more famously made by the\npioneering field anthropologist, Bronislaw Malinowski, it is under\nsuch circumstances, where failure is a distinct possibility, and a\nmatter of urgency hangs in the balance, that the gods are invoked and\ntheir blessings sought in order to bring some human endeavor to a\nsuccessful completion. The gods are beings who are able to do or know\nwhat humans would like to be able to do or know, but cannot\n(T 39).\n\nReligion, on this account, does not originate, as philosophy does,\nfrom a theoretical or speculative impulse to understand the world, but\nrather from a practical concern to influence the course of events that\ntranspire within it. Belief in gods thus presupposes a desire that\nthere should exist beings capable of guaranteeing the success of human\nendeavors, and faith is preceded by hope in the logical order of\nthings religious. If human beings did not have a powerful desire, say,\nto be liberated from bondage or to avoid death, belief in the Promised\nLand or in immortality would never have arisen. In biblical terms,\nfaith in God is trust in what God promises, but what is promised by\nGod is what is sought after or desired by human beings. The religious\nsignificance of God\u2019s promises is contingent upon their\ncorrespondence to deep-seated human desires. Whereas, in The\nEssence of Religion, Feuerbach referred to the feeling of\ndependence as the \u201cground\u201d of religion, he now attributes\nthe psychological origin of the gods to the wish. The wish, considered\nas an act of striving for what remains beyond the limits of human\npower to achieve, is theogonic in the sense that theophanies (i.e.,\nmanifestations of the gods or of God) described in the Homeric epics\nand in the Bible, considered as narrative events, occur as responses\nto powerful human wishes or needs, or else as expressions of gratitude\nand celebration in response to occasions where these needs are\nbelieved to have been met through the cooperation or assistance of a\ndivine agency (T 32). The gods owe their existence to\n\u201csensualism and materialism\u201d insofar as they are the\nproduct of the material needs of finite, embodied human subjects.\n\nInteresting sections of the Theogony are devoted to analyzing\nthe role of the gods in the consecration of oaths, and to the origins\nof conscience in the aggrieved will-to-happiness of the other.\nFeuerbach attributes belief in divine justice to the wish that the\nperson by whom one has been harmed should suffer harm themselves\n(T 103). He appeals to the mythological representations of\nthe furies and of Medusa as evidence of the \u201csensual\u201d\norigins of the voice of conscience (T 136), which presupposes\na powerful, involuntary sense of sympathy with the suffering of person\nwho has suffered, or stands to suffer from, one\u2019s actions. It is\n\u201conly in his egoism that man has a criterion for distinguishing\nbetween right and writing\u201d (T 140). At one point in the\nTheogony Feuerbach defines morality (Sittlichkeit)\nas \u201cthe drive-to-happiness endowed with wisdom, the wise,\nrational, healthy, normal, justified (gerechte)\nself-love\u201d (T 82).\n\nWhen human beings in the course of their history acquire new and\ndifferent wishes, they tend also to worship new and different\ndivinities. Whereas the ancient Greco-Roman pagans, and even the\nancient Hebrews, were mainly concerned to secure blessedness in the\nform of long life and temporal prosperity, the early Christians sought\ntheir blessedness in eternity or \u201ceternal life\u201d. Feuerbach\nclosely associates this shift from a concern with temporal blessedness\nto a concern with eternal blessedness with the Christian emphasis on\ncreation ex nihilo, which he contrasts both with the Hebrew account of\ncreation as involving the forming and ordering of pre-existent\nelements, and the limitation of the Greco-Roman gods to being able to\nprolong the lives of mortals, and securing their blessedness in this\nlife, without being able to confer immortality upon them. The freedom\nfrom natural necessity ascribed by early Christian thinkers to God is\ninterpreted by Feuerbach as an expression of the wish of these\nChristians to be free themselves from the constraints of material\nexistence.\n",
