    "main_text": "Theoretical Frameworks || String Theory\n3.1 String Theory\n\nKnown variously as string theory, superstring theory, and M-theory,\nthis program (qua theory of quantum gravity) has its roots,\nindirectly, in the observation, dating back to at least the 1930s,\nthat classical general relativity looks in many ways like the theory\nof a massless \u2018spin-two\u2019 field propagating on the flat\nMinkowski spacetime of special relativity. [See Cappelli et\nal. (eds.) 2012, and Gasperini and Maharana (eds.) 2008, for\ncollections of essays covering the early history of string theory;\nRickles 2014 offers a conceptually-oriented history of the earlier\ndays of string theory; Rovelli 2001b (Other Internet Resources section\nbelow) and 2006 offer a capsule history, and Greene 2000 provides a\npopular account.] This observation led to early attempts to formulate\na quantum theory of gravity by \u201cquantizing\u201d this spin-two\ntheory. However, it turned out that the theory is not perturbatively\nrenormalizable, meaning that there are ineliminable infinities.\nAttempts to modify the classical theory to eliminate this problem led\nto a different problem, non-unitarity, and so this general approach\nwas moribund until the mid-1970s, when it was discovered that a theory\nof one-dimensional \u201cstrings\u201d developed around 1970 to\naccount for the strong interaction, actually provided a framework for\na unified theory which included gravity, because one of the modes of\noscillation of the string corresponded to a massless spin-two particle\n(the \u2018graviton\u2019).\n\nThe original and still prominent idea behind string theory was to\nreplace the point particles of ordinary quantum field theory\n(particles like photons, electrons, etc) with one-dimensional extended\nobjects called strings. (See Weingard, 2001 and Witten, 2001 for\noverviews of the conceptual framework.) In the early development of\nthe theory, it was recognized that construction of a consistent\nquantum theory of strings required that the strings \u201clive\u201d\nin a larger number of spatial dimensions than the observed three.\nString theories containing fermions as well as bosons must be\nformulated in nine space dimensions and one time dimension. Strings\ncan be open or closed, and have a characteristic tension and hence\nvibrational spectrum. The various modes of vibration correspond to\nvarious particles, one of which is the graviton (the hypothetical\nmassless, spin-2 particle responsible for mediating gravitational\ninteractions). The resulting theories have the advantage of being\nperturbatively renormalizable. This means that perturbative\ncalculations are at least mathematically tractable. Since perturbation\ntheory is an almost indispensable tool for physicists, this is deemed\na good thing.\n\nString theory has undergone several mini-revolutions over the last\nseveral years, one of which involved the discovery of various duality\nrelations, mathematical transformations connecting, in this case, what\nappear to be physically distinct string theories \u2014 type I, type\nIIA, type IIB, (heterotic) SO(32) and (heterotic)\nE8\u00d7E8 \u2014 to one another and to\neleven-dimensional supergravity (a particle theory). The discovery of\nthese connections led to the conjecture that all of the string\ntheories are really aspects of a single underlying theory, which was\ngiven the name \u2018M-theory\u2019 (though M-theory is also used\nmore specifically to describe the unknown theory of which\neleven-dimensional supergravity is the low energy limit). The\nrationale, according to one kind of duality (S-duality), is that one\ntheory at strong coupling (high energy description) is physically\nequivalent (in terms of physical symmetries, correlation functions and\nall observable content) to another theory at weak coupling (where a\nlower energy means a more tractable description), and that if all the\ntheories are related to one another by dualities such as this, then\nthey must all be aspects of some more fundamental theory. Though\nattempts have been made, there has been no successful formulation of\nthis theory: its very existence, much less its nature, is still\nlargely a matter of conjecture.\n\nThere has been some recent interest in dualities by philosophers,\ngiven their clear links to standard philosophical issues such as\nunderdetermination, conventionalism, and emergence/reduction. The link\ncomes about because in a dual pair (of theories) one has a observable\nequivalence combined with what appears to be radical physical (and\nmathematical) differences. These differences can be as extreme as\ndescribing spacetimes of apparently different topological structures,\nincluding different numbers of dimensions. This has led some\nphysicists to speak of spacetime emerging, depending on such\nthings as the coupling strength governing physical interactions. This\ncan be seen most clearly in the context of the AdS/CFT duality in\nwhich a ten dimensional string theory is found to be observationally\nequivalent (again covering physical symmetries, observables and their\ncorrelation functions) to a four dimensional gauge theory \u2014 this\nis sometimes called a \u2018gauge/gravity\u2019 duality since the\nstring theory contains gravity (all string theories contain\ngravitons) while the gauge theory does not. Since there is an\nequivalence between these descriptions, it makes sense to say that\nneither is fundamental, and so (elements of) the spacetimes they\napparently describe are also not fundamental; thus implying that the\nspacetime we observe at low-energies is an emergent phenomenon \u2014\nVistarini 2013 is a recent discussion of spacetime emergence in string\ntheory. One way to view such dual pairs is in terms of the two\ntheories (the gauge theory and a gravitational theory) being distinct\nclassical limits of a more all-encompassing quantum theory. In this\ncase, the classical emergent structures also include the specific\ngauge symmetries and degrees of freedom of the limiting theories. A\nproblem remains of making sense of the more fundamental theory (and\nthe associated physical structure it describes) from which these\nspacetimes and gauge symmetries emerge. \n\nPhilosophically speaking, there is a large question mark over whether\nthe dual pair should be seen as genuinely distinct in a physical sense\nor as mere notational variants of the same theory \u2014 talk of a\n\u201cdictionary\u201d relating the theories makes the latter more\npalatable and suggests that the choice of physical interpretation\nmight be conventional. However, if we view the theories as notational\nvariants, then our sense of theory-individuation is seemingly\ncompromised, since the dual pairs involve different dynamics and\ndegrees of freedom. (See Joseph Polchinski 2014, for a thorough\naccount of the various kinds of dualities along with some of their\ninterpretive quirks; Rickles 2011 provides a philosophical examination\nof string dualities.) \n",
