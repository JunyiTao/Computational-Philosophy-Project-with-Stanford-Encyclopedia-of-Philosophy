    "main_text": "\n\nNelson Goodman has certainly been one of the most influential figures\nin contemporary aesthetics and analytic philosophy in general (in\naddition to aesthetics, his contributions cover the areas of applied\nlogic, metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of science). His\nLanguages of Art (first published in 1968 [Goodman 1976]),\ntogether with Ernst Gombrich\u2019s Art and Illusion (1960)\nand Richard Wollheim\u2019s Art and Its Objects (1968),\nrepresents a fundamental turning point in the analytic approach to\nartistic issues in Anglo-American philosophy. His often unorthodox\ntake on art is part of a general approach to knowledge and reality,\nand is always pervasively informed by his cognitivism, nominalism,\nrelativism, and constructivism. From Languages of Art and\nsubsequent works, a general view of the arts as contributing to the\nunderstanding and indeed to the building of the realities we live in\nemerges. Ultimately, in Goodman\u2019s view, art is not sharply\ndistinguished, in goals and means, from science and ordinary\nexperience. Paintings, musical sonatas, dances, etc. all are symbols\nthat classify parts of reality for us, as do such things as scientific\ntheories and what makes up common, ordinary knowledge.\n",
