    "main_text": "Epistemology and Psychology || Did Alcmaeon Practice Dissection?\n2.3 Did Alcmaeon Practice Dissection?\n\nAlcmaeon\u2019s empiricism has sometimes been thought to have arisen\nfrom his experience as a practicing physician (Guthrie 1962). He has\nalso been hailed as the first to use dissection, but this is based on\na hasty reading of the evidence. Calcidius, in his Latin commentary on\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus, praises Alcmaeon, along with\nCallisthenes and Herophilus, for having brought many things to light\nabout the nature of the eye (DK, A10). Most of what Calcidius goes on\nto describe, however, are the discoveries of Herophilus some two\ncenturies after Alcmaeon (Lloyd 1975, Mansfeld 1975, Solmsen 1961).\nThe only conclusions we can reasonably draw about Alcmaeon from the\npassage are that he excised the eyeball of an animal and observed\nporoi (channels, i.e. the optic nerve) leading from the eye\nin the direction of the brain (Lloyd 1975). Theophrastus\u2019\naccount of Alcmaeon\u2019s theory of sensation implies that he\nthought that there were such channels leading from each of the senses\nto the brain:\n\nAll the senses are connected in some way with the brain. As a result,\nthey are incapacitated when it is disturbed or changes its place, for\nit then stops the channels, through which the senses operate. (DK, A5)\n\n\nThere is no evidence, however, that Alcmaeon dissected the eye itself\nor that he dissected the skull in order to trace the optic nerve all\nthe way to the brain. Alcmaeon\u2019s account of the other senses,\nfar from suggesting that he carried out dissections in order to\nexplain their function, implies that he did not (Lloyd 1975; for a\npartial critique of Lloyd see Perilli 2001). Alcmaeon\u2019s\nconclusion that all of the senses are connected to the brain may have\nbeen drawn from nothing more than the excision of the eye and the\ngeneral observation that the sense organs for sight, hearing, smell,\nand taste are located on the head and appear connected to passages\nwhich lead inward towards the brain (Gomperz 1953, 69). It is striking\nin this regard that Alcmaeon gave no account of touch (DK, A5), which\nis the only sense not specifically tied to the head. It would be a\nserious mistake then to say that Alcmaeon discovered dissection or\nthat he was the father of anatomy, since there is no evidence that he\nused dissection systematically or even that he did more than excise a\nsingle eyeball.\n",
