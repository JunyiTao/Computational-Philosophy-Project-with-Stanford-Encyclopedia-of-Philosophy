    "main_text": "Hayek Against Justice || Fair Practices\n5.3 Fair Practices\n\nNote the similarity between Hayek\u2019s view and the view expressed\nby John Rawls in \u201cTwo Concepts of Rules\u201d (1955). Hayek and\nRawls both understood what is involved in a practice having\nutility. To use Rawls\u2019s example, the practice of baseball is\ndefined by procedural rules rather than by end-state principles of\ndistributive justice. To have a practice at all, we must be dogmatic\n(Hayek would say) about how many strikes a batter should get.\n\nImagine changing the concept of the game so that the umpire\u2019s\njob is to make sure the good guys win. What would that do to the\nplayers? What would become of their striving? The result of the change\nwould not be baseball. If we end up with a game where the umpire is\nmaking sure the favored side wins, then the players are sitting on the\nsidelines watching, hoping to be favored. Hayek\u2019s insight (and\nRawls\u2019s insight at that stage of his career) is that genuine\nfairness is not about making sure prizes are properly\n distributed.[11]\n It is not even about making sure outcomes are not unduly influenced\nby morally arbitrary factors such as how well the players played or\nhow hard they worked to develop their talent. True fairness is about\nbeing impartial, nonpartisan\u2014proverbially, \u201cletting the\nplayers play.\u201d\n\nOne of Hayek\u2019s problems with the kind of justice that amounts to\nmaking sure the good guys win is that it tends to turn society\u2019s\nbasic structure into a political football, which tends to squander\ngains from trade. To Hayek, again, true justice is about letting the\nplayers play, in the same way as pareto-improving economic\ncoordination is about letting the players\n play.[12]\n",
