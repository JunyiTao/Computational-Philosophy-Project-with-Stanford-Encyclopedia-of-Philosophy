    "main_text": "Concluding remarks || Transworld identity and counterpart theory\n6.2 Lewis on transworld identity and \u2018existence according to a world\u2019\n\nFinally, we can note that Lewis (1986) has presented a challenge to\nthe self-styled champions of \u2018transworld identity\u2019 to\nexplain why the view that they insist on deserves to be\ncalled a commitment to transworld identity at all.\n\nThroughout this article, it has been assumed that a commitment to\ntransworld identity may be differentiated from a commitment to\ncounterpart theory on the grounds that the transworld identity\ntheorist accepts, while the counterpart theorist denies, that an\nobject exists in more than one possible world (cf. Section\n1.2 above). However, as Lewis points out, there is a notion of\n\u2018existence according to a (possible) world\u2019 that\nis completely neutral as between a counterpart-theoretic and a\n\u2018transworld identity\u2019 interpretation. In terms of this\nneutral conception, as long as the counterpart theorist and transworld\nidentity theorist agree that Bertrand Russell could have been a\nplaywright instead of a philosopher, they must agree that Russell\nexists according to more than one world. In particular, they\nmust agree that, according to our world, he exists and is a\nphilosopher, and according to some other worlds, he exists\nand is a non-philosopher playwright (cf. Lewis 1986, 194). The\ndifference between the theorists, then, allegedly consists in their\ndifferent interpretations of what it is for Russell to exist\n\u2018according to\u2019 a world. In the view of the counterpart\ntheorist, for Russell to exist according to a possible world in which\nhe is a playwright is for him to have a counterpart in that\nworld who is (in that world) a playwright. According to the transworld\nidentity theorist, it is supposed to be for Russell (himself) to\nexist in that world as a playwright.\n\nIf the transworld identity theorist were a Lewisian realist about\npossible worlds, this notion of existence in a world could be\nclearly distinguished from the neutral notion of existence\naccording to a world, on the grounds that the existence of\nRussell in a world would require his complete or partial presence as a\npart of such a world (cf. Section 1.2 above). But, as Lewis notes, the\nself-styled champions of \u2018transworld identity\u2019 who oppose\nhis counterpart theory are philosophers who repudiate a Lewisian\nrealist conception of what it takes for Russell to exist in more than\none possible world. Hence, he argues, there is a question about their\nentitlement to claim that, according to their theory, Russell exists\nin other possible worlds in any sense that goes beyond the\nneutral thesis (compatible with counterpart theory) that Russell\nexists according to other worlds. Thus Lewis writes (using\nthe 1968 US presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey as his\nexample):\n\nThe philosophers\u2019 chorus on behalf of \u2018trans-world\nidentity\u2019 is merely insisting that, for instance, it is Humphrey\nhimself who might have existed under other conditions, \u2026 who\nmight have won the presidency, who exists according to many worlds and\nwins according to some of them. All that is uncontroversial. The\ncontroversial question is how he manages to have these modal\nproperties. (1986, 198)\n\nA natural reaction to Lewis\u2019s challenge is to point out that a\nproponent of transworld identity who is not a Lewisian realist will\ntypically reject Lewis\u2019s counterpart theory on the grounds that\nhis counterpart relation does not have the logic of identity. If so,\nthen (pace Lewis) it is not the case, strictly speaking, that\nthe \u2018philosophers\u2019 chorus on behalf of \u201ctrans-world\nidentity\u201d\u2019 is merely insisting on the neutral claim that\nobjects exist according to more than one world. However, even if this\nis correct, it does not answer a further potential challenge. Suppose,\nas seems plausible, that there could be a counterpart relation that\n(unlike the one proposed by Lewis himself) is an equivalence relation\n(transitive, symmetric, and reflexive), and \u2018one-one between\nworlds\u2019. What would distinguish, in the case of a theorist\nwho is not a Lewisian realist about possible worlds, between, on\nthe one hand, a commitment to the interpretation of de re\nmodal statements in terms of such an \u2018identity-resembling\u2019\ncounterpart relation, and, on the other hand, a commitment to genuine\ntransworld identity (and hence to the view that an individual\ngenuinely exists in a number of distinct possible worlds)?\nThe aficionado of transworld identity owes Lewis a reply to this\nchallenge.\n",
