    "main_text": "Issues about Diachronic Norms || Bayesianism without Kinematics\n5.6 Bayesianism without Kinematics\n\nConfronted with the existing problems for the Principle of\nConditionalization, some Bayesians turn away from any diachronic norm\nand develop another variety of Bayesianism: time-slice\nBayesianism. On this view, what credences you should (or may)\nhave at any particular time depend solely on the total\nevidence you have at that same time\u2014independently of your\nearlier credences. To specify this dependency relation is to specify\nexclusively synchronic norms\u2014and to forget about diachronic\nnorms. Strictly speaking, there is still a diachronic norm, but it is\nderived rather than fundamental: when the time flows from \\(t\\) to\n\\(t'\\), your credences ought to change in a certain way\u2014they\nought to change to the credences that you ought to have with respect\nto your total evidence at the latter time \\(t'\\)\u2014and the earlier\ntime \\(t\\) is to be ignored. Any diachronic norm, if correct, is at\nmost an epiphenomenon that arises when correct synchronic norms are\napplied repeatedly across different times, according to time-slice\nBayesianism. (This view is stated above in terms of one\u2019s total\nevidence, but that can be replaced by one\u2019s total reasons or\ninformation.)\n\nA particular version of this view is held by J. Williamson (2010: ch.\n4), who is so firmly an objective Bayesian that he argues that the\nPrinciple of Conditionalization should be rejected if it is in\nconflict with repeated applications of certain synchronic norms, such\nas Probabilism and the Principle of Maximum Entropy (which generalizes\nthe Principle of Indifference; see\n supplement D).\n Time-slice Bayesianism as a general position is developed and\ndefended by Hedden (2015a, 2015b).\n\n\n",
