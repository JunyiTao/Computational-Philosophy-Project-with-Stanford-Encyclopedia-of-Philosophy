Narrow content contrasts with\n\u201cbroad\u201d or \u201cwide\u201d content, which depends on\nfeatures of the individual\u2019s environment as well as on features\nof the individual. It is controversial whether there is any such thing\nas narrow content. Assuming that there is, it is also controversial\nwhat sort of content it is, what its relation to ordinary or\n\u201cbroad\u201d content is, and how it is determined by the\nindividual\u2019s intrinsic properties.\n",
