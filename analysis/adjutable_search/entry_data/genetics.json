    "preamble": "\n\nEvelyn Fox Keller dubbed the 1900s the \u201ccentury of the\ngene\u201d, and for good reason (Fox Keller 2002). During a 100-year\nspan that opened with excitement about the research Mendel conducted\ndecades earlier and closed with the Human Genome Project, disciplines\nranging from comparative anatomy to oncology were infused with genetic\nconcepts, genetic principles, and genetic methodologies. The first two\ndecades of the twenty-first century have seen this trend only\nexpand.\n\nSo it should not be surprising that philosophers have gravitated to\ngenetics in an attempt to understand how that science works, what it\nsays about the world, and what impact it has on people living in a\nsociety where there is so much focus on genes. This encyclopedia\nrepresents well this significant philosophical interest. Over 100\nentries discuss some aspect of genetics, and those entries engage a\nwide range of philosophical questions\u2014questions about scientific\nexplanation, questions about the process of evolution, questions about\ndisability, questions about race. With such diverse philosophical\ninterest in genetics, no single encyclopedia entry could do justice to\nthe full scope of that science and the rich philosophical attention it\nhas received. Instead, this entry serves as a door into that\nphilosophical world. After a historically-guided introduction to the\nscience of genetics and its transformative impact, the piece reviews a\nsample of the philosophical questions that genetics has generated,\nwith direction to entries where those topics are discussed in greater\ndetail. The hope is that the entry will serve as an orientation to the\ndiversity of philosophical thought concerning genetics that is\ndistributed throughout the encyclopedia. (The entry on\n evolution\n provides a similar guide to the trove of entries that review\nphilosophical discussions around that topic.)\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Science of Genetics\n\nGenetics is devoted to the study and manipulation of heredity and\nvariation in living organisms. Genetics is so pervasive in\ntwenty-first century science\u2014in reproductive screening\ntechnologies like preimplantation genetic diagnosis, in assessments of\nwhat species are endangered, in public health programs that track\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria, to name a few\u2014that it is easy to\nforget what these disparate practices all have in common with one\nanother: a focus on the patterns and mechanisms of trait transmission\nfrom one generation to the next in order to understand and potentially\ncontrol that process. This contemporary focus can be traced back to\nthe first years of the twentieth century, when genetics took shape as\na unique field of study.\n1.1 Birth of a Discipline\n\nGregor Mendel, the Austrian monk now commonly referred to as the\n\u201cfather of genetics\u201d, never uttered the terms\n\u201cgene\u201d or \u201cgenetics\u201d because those terms\nweren\u2019t introduced until decades after his death. In 1865, he\nreported on the results of breeding experiments he performed\nhybridizing pea plants during which he tracked how a series of traits\n(e.g., round vs. wrinkled peas, white vs. purple flowers) passed down\nthrough generations. Mendel noted certain patterns of inheritance; for\nexample, traits seemed to be transmitted independently of one another\n(Mendel 1866). Mendel died in 1884, at which point there was little\nindication that he would end up in biology textbooks (Olby 1985).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1900 that the full force of Mendel\u2019s\nobservations became absorbed by the scientific community. That year,\nthree different European botanists reported on the results of their\nown breeding experiments and linked their results back to\nMendel\u2019s work decades earlier. Mendel\u2019s research, at this\ntime, was characterized as revealing heredity to involve the\ntransmission of discrete hereditary factors that obeyed fundamental\nprinciples\u2014that organisms get one copy of each factor from each\nparent and, in turn, pass one copy on to their own offspring (the law\nof segregation), that the factors segregate independently of one\nanother (the law of independent assortment), and that certain factors\ndominate other factors when it comes to expressing the trait\nassociated with that factor (the law of dominance) (entry:\n gene).\n William Bateson, a biologist at the University of Cambridge at the\ntime, was excited about the implications of Mendel\u2019s work for\ntheories of evolution; he recruited a number of young\nscientists\u2014women in particular\u2014to Cambridge to perform\nexperiments showing that Mendel\u2019s principles extended across the\nplant and animal kingdoms (Richmond 2001). He called this new\ndiscipline \u201cgenetics\u201d, and \u201cgene\u201d became the\nterm for the factor that was inherited (entry:\n the genotype/phenotype distinction).\n\nWith genetics carved out as a unique field of study, two threads of\ngenetic research ensued. One thread focused on identifying the\nphysical unit of heredity that was passed from generation to\ngeneration\u2014to figure out what genes were, where they were\nlocated, how they operated, and how that operation produced the\nhereditary patterns consistent with Mendel\u2019s principles (entry:\n theories of biological development).\n Thomas Hunt Morgan\u2019s research at Columbia University most\ncontributed to this work. Morgan studied fruit flies, in part because\nthey bred quickly and were easy to maintain. With a team of young\nscientists, he crossed thousands upon thousands of fruit flies,\ntracking how traits like eye color and wing shape transmitted across\ngenerations. They also induced mutations using a variety of chemical\nand radiation interventions (see the entry on\n experiment in biology).\n This research proved that genes were located on chromosomes, and it\nshowed how the physics of chromosomal action during meiosis impacted\nthe hereditary process; for example, genes closer together on\nchromosomes were more often inherited together, while genes that were\nfurther apart more often separated from one another during chromosomal\nrecombination. This realization allowed Morgan and his students to\nproduce the first gene maps\u2014charts of genes\u2019 relative\nlocations to one another\u2014and also determine that certain traits\nwere sex-linked due to their location on sex chromosomes (Darden 1991;\nKohler 1994).\n\nThe other thread of genetic research that emerged attended to the\nevolutionary implications of Mendelian inheritance. Charles Darwin\npublished On the Origin of Species in 1859, and the fact of\nevolution was widely recognized by 1900; however, the nature of the\nevolutionary process remained contested (Darwin 1859). According to\nDarwin, evolution was a very slow and gradual process, with natural\nselection favoring subtle differences between organisms (slightly\nlonger legs, for example) that inclined one to be more successful at\nreproduction in some particular environment (entry:\n Darwinism).\n Mendel\u2019s principles of inheritance, when they were hailed at\nthe turn of the twentieth century, were thought by many geneticists to\nbe incompatible with Darwinian evolution because Mendelian inheritance\nseemed more discrete (e.g., round or wrinkled peas, purple\nor white flowers), and so it was favored by scientists who\nadvocated for a faster and more discontinuous process of evolution.\nIndeed, one of the reasons that Bateson so eagerly championed\nMendel\u2019s work was because he was a proponent of this less\ngradual interpretation (entries:\n evolution;\n fitness).\n\nThe apparent incompatibility between Darwinian evolution and Mendelian\ninheritance persisted until 1918 when British biologist R.A. Fisher\nfirst indicated how the two sciences could be related; if traits were\nassumed to be the product of many Mendelian factors, then Darwinian\nnatural selection could favor subtle variations in the traits, and the\npopulations undergoing that selection pressure would gradually evolve\nall while the organisms in that population obeyed the Mendelian\nprinciples of inheritance (Fisher 1918). Fisher\u2019s contribution\nwas the first in a series of works\u2014most notably by he, J.B.S.\nHaldane, and Sewall Wright\u2014to reconceive of evolution as changes\nin population gene frequencies. The union of Mendel and Darwin came to\nbe called \u201cthe modern synthesis\u201d, and the mathematical\nmodels that Fisher, Haldane, and Wright developed launched the field\nof population genetics (Provine 1971; entry:\n population genetics).\n Evolutionary biology, which had long been made up of qualitative\narguments about, for example, the similarity between selection on\ndomesticated crops/livestock and selection in nature, suddenly became\nconcerned with mathematical arguments about the quantifiable\ninfluences of migration, genetic drift, mutation, and natural\nselection on populations (entries:\n ecological genetics;\n heritability;\n genetic drift).\n1.2 Genetics and Eugenics\n\nFrancis Galton, the younger cousin of Darwin, coined the term\n\u201ceugenics\u201d in 1883, meaning \u201cgood birth\u201d\n(Galton 1883). In nature, Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by\nnatural selection suggested that the fit members of a population would\noutbreed the unfit members; Galton and other eugenicists, however,\nworried that this natural process was not playing out in human\npopulations\u2014that, in humans, the unfit were outbreeding the fit.\nA variety of social, economic, and political forces, the eugenicists\nwarned, inclined people with undesirable traits (like criminality and\n\u201cfeeblemindedness\u201d\u2014a catchall term for intellectual\ndisability) to have more children, while people with desirable traits\n(like high intelligence and creativity) were incentivized to have\nfewer children (Paul 1995).\n\nWhen genetics came on the scientific scene in 1900, many eugenicists\nembraced the new theory of inheritance, believing that it offered a\nscientific foundation for their social vision. The eugenicists assumed\nthat human traits like criminality and intelligence played by the same\nhereditary rules as the traits that Mendel and Morgan made famous,\nwhere single genes were associated with single traits. The eugenic\ntask, then, was to decrease the transmission of undesirable genes to\nthe next generation, and increase the transmission of desirable genes.\nEugenicists advocated for a variety of social and political\ninterventions to produce more fit and less unfit\nhumans\u2014sterilization of the unfit, immigration restriction acts\nthat prohibited the influx of people from entire nations deemed unfit,\nanti-miscegenation laws that restricted \u201crace mixing\u201d; as\nwell as \u201cfitter family contests\u201d that praised the\nfecundity of fit couples, eugenic sermon contests that encouraged\nclergy to preach the religious justifications for eugenics, and\neugenic guidance to couples considering reproduction (Rosen 2004;\nLombardo 2008).\n\nBy the 1940s and 1950s, a number of social and scientific trends\nemerged that undermined the eugenicists\u2019 agenda. At the\nconclusion of World War II, it became clear that Nazi atrocities\ntargeting certain populations for eradication were inspired by eugenic\nideas cultivated in the very countries that fought against Germany.\nSocial commentators pointed out that \u201cfit humans\u201d and\n\u201cunfit humans\u201d were not scientific terms; rather, they\nwere racist, sexist, classist, and nativist concepts designed to\nprivilege wealthy, educated White people and devalue socioeconomically\ndisadvantaged minority populations. On the scientific side, social\nsciences like anthropology and sociology drew increasing attention to\nthe social and economic forces at work in populations that contributed\nto criminality, destitution, and mental illness. And genetics\ntoo\u2014the eugenicists\u2019 chosen science\u2014ultimately\ninvalidated eugenics. Complex human traits like intelligence and\nantisocial behavior were not the result of any single gene; they were\nthe result of many genetic and environmental factors all working in\ncomplicated and generally unpredictable ways over the course of human\ndevelopment (Tabery 2014). That insight, alongside the social science\nobservations, ensured that no amount of sterilization or immigration\nrestriction would eliminate the traits eugenicists found undesirable\n(Kevles 1985).\n\n\u201cEugenics\u201d as a term fell out of favor by mid-century.\nEugenic programs rebranded themselves as \u201cmedical\ngenetics\u201d programs; eugenic journals and organizations dropped\nthe word in exchange for phrases like \u201csocial biology\u201d and\n\u201chuman genetics\u201d. This terminological shift, however,\nbelied an ongoing interest among many scientists and non-scientists\nalike in using the insights of genetics to control human heredity\n(entry:\n eugenics).\n1.3 Genetics Goes Molecular\n\nMorgan\u2019s fruit fly research proved that genes were on\nchromosomes. But by the 1950s it was still unclear what genes were\nmade up of, what their molecular structure was, and how that structure\nproduced the observable hereditary patterns found in nature.\nBiologists at the time debated whether the genetic material was\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or proteins; Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod,\nand Maclyn McCarty had previously indicated in research on mice that\nit was DNA, but this conclusion was by no means universally accepted\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty 1944). Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase at\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory ingeniously used viruses\u2014made up\nof a protein body (or \u201ccoat\u201d) and DNA inside\u2014that\ninfected bacteria to settle the matter (Hershey and Chase 1952). They\nfirst radioactively labeled the viruses\u2019 protein coat and\nallowed them to infect the bacteria, and then they radioactively\nlabeled the viruses\u2019 DNA and allowed them to infect the\nbacteria. The question was: When the viruses replicated in the\nbacteria, would the radioactive marker show up in the bacteria\ninfected by viruses with radioactively-labeled proteins or in the\nbacteria infected by viruses with radioactively-labeled DNA? It was\nthe latter, and that convinced molecular biologists that deciphering\nthe molecular structure of DNA was the next major challenge (entry:\n molecular biology).\n\nA number of geneticists, structural chemists, and physicists descended\non the structure of DNA in the 1950s (Olby 1994). It was James Watson\nand Francis Crick at the University of Cambridge who first determined\nthat DNA was a double-helix (Watson and Crick 1953). Utilizing\nWatson\u2019s genetic expertise, Crick\u2019s work in theoretical\nphysics, and Rosalind Franklin\u2019s x-ray crystallographic images\nof DNA (appallingly, without her consent or even knowledge), Watson\nand Crick built a model of DNA showing two polynucleotide strands\nspiraling around one another (de Chadarevian 2002; Maddox 2002). The\nstrands were made up of a sequence of nucleic acids\u2014combinations\nof adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), such that\nan adenine on one strand hydrogen-bonded with a thymine on the other\nand a cytosine on one strand hydrogen-bonded with a guanine on the\nother (entry:\n models in science).\n\nMolecular biologists spent the remainder of the 1950s and 1960s\ndetermining how the double-helical structure of DNA helped to\nelucidate the mechanisms of genetic replication and function. This\nresearch was guided by the notion that the gene was an informational\nmolecule (Kay 2000). The nucleic acid bases were \u201cletters\u201d\nwhich, in sets of three, made up \u201cwords\u201d that\n\u201ccoded\u201d for one amino acid. Each chromosome was a\n\u201cchapter\u201d in an organism\u2019s entire genome\u2014the\n\u201cbook of life\u201d. These weren\u2019t just catchy phrases\nfor newspaper headlines. The technical language of molecular biology\nemployed the information metaphor. DNA was \u201ctranscribed\u201d\ninto RNA, which was then \u201ctranslated\u201d into\nproteins\u2014the central dogma of molecular biology (entry:\n biological information).\n\nEvolutionary biology also followed this reductionistic trend down to\nmolecules. Molecular evolution emerged as a field of study where\nevolutionary changes were tracked at the level of DNA sequences, and\nDNA became thought of as a ledger of evolutionary history. Most\ngenetic mutations, it became clear, had little to no impact on an\norganism\u2019s fitness\u2014either because the mutation occurred in\nsuch a way that the same amino acid was produced anyway (a product of\nredundancy in the genetic code) or because the mutation occurred in a\nregion of the genome where no proteins were coded; this, in turn,\nforced biologists to rethink the extent to which DNA sequences could\nbe understood as the product of natural selection alone (Kimura 1968;\nDietrich 1994). Mutation rates in homologous DNA sequences shared by\ndifferent species (say, humans and chimpanzees) also allowed for\ninferring how far back those two species diverged from a common\nancestor (entries:\n ecological genetics;\n genetic drift).\n1.4 Medical Genetics\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, as the science of genetics was just beginning\nto go molecular, a new batch of programs started showing up at medical\nschools with names like \u201cheredity clinic\u201d and\n\u201cmedical genetics\u201d. The faculty and staff at these units\neschewed direct reference to eugenics, but their methods and clinical\nadvice were quite similar. They advertised reproductive counseling in\nlocal newspapers. When couples showed up at the clinics, the\ngeneticists asked questions about what medical conditions ran in their\nfamily, and then the scientists constructed pedigrees to track the\nconditions. This facilitated hereditary risk assessments of what could\nbe transmitted to children born from that genetic union, and couples\nat risk of bearing a child with some disability were advised not to\nprocreate (Comfort 2012).\n\nWith the onset of the molecular revolution in biology in the 1950s and\n1960s, the suite of services that medical geneticists could offer\npatients expanded. Carrier screening became available, which allowed\nfor informing a patient that they carried a recessive allele of a\ndisease-causing gene and so may pass that trait onto a child even if\nthey did not show symptoms of the disease themselves. Amniocentesis\nwas also developed, which allowed for extracting fetal cells from the\namniotic sac, culturing those cells, and then testing for a range of\nmedical conditions in the fetus (Harper 2008).\n\nThe proliferation of genetic technologies in the mid-twentieth century\nbrought with it a demand for healthcare workers who could process that\ninformation and help patients understand it. The result was genetic\ncounseling programs. The professional emergence of genetic counseling\noccurred at the very same time that abortion was decriminalized in a\nnumber of countries, the disability rights movement and second-wave\nfeminism gained momentum, and bioethical attention to patient autonomy\nbecame a serious consideration in clinical care. This created a\nprofound tension for the young community of genetic counselors. On the\none hand, genetic counseling had a disciplinary ancestry that ran\ndirectly through heredity clinics and straightforward eugenics before\nthat; many of the genetic counselor\u2019s tools (e.g., constructing\na family pedigree) and many of the traits that received genetic\ncounseling attention (e.g., Down syndrome) were the very same tools\nand traits at the center of the earlier practices. On the other hand,\nthe genetic counselors\u2014mostly women\u2014were much more attuned\nthan the heredity clinic and medical genetics pioneers\u2014mostly\nmen\u2014to the moral and social problems with paternalistic medicine\nand eugenics highlighted by the critics from feminism, disability\nrights, and bioethics. The genetic counselors navigated this tension\nby embracing a principle of nondirectiveness; rather than telling\npatients how to act on the genetic information they received, genetic\ncounselors aspired to simply convey that genetic information in a\nnon-biased way and help the patients decide for themselves how to act\non that information (Stern 2012).\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, teams of researchers in the\never-expanding pool of medical genetics and human genetics programs\ncompeted to be the first to find the precise genomic location of\ndisease-causing genes. The challenge was to determine which\nchromosome, then which stretch of DNA, and finally which specific\nnucleic acid mutation was responsible for conditions like cystic\nfibrosis and breast cancer; the leaders of the teams that crossed the\nfinish line first became scientific celebrities. The excitement\nsurrounding the genetic discoveries was partly about the thrill of a\nscientific race; but more than that, it was also about the promise of\ngenetic tests that could tell patients more accurately whether or not\nthey were likely to develop some devastating disease and, beyond that,\nlead to the development of gene-based treatments or even cures for\nthose diseases.\n1.5 Genetics Goes Genomic and Postgenomic\n\nAs more and more diseases were being linked up to locations in the\nhuman genome throughout the 1990s, geneticists shifted their attention\nto the grand prize\u2014sequencing the entire human genome\n(Cook-Deegan 1994). Ever since the discovery of the double-helical\nstructure of DNA, geneticists knew what genes were made of and what\nstructure they took. But they did not know how many genes there were.\nAnd with the exception of the handful of genes that had already been\ndiscovered, they did not know where the vast majority of genes were\nlocated. The challenge was to spell out the ordered sequence of the\nhuman genome in its entirety\u2014no small task when you consider\nthat all three billion base pairs of the human genome reside in cells\nno bigger than the period at the end of this sentence. The Human\nGenome Project met the challenge with the largest and most expensive\nbiological collaboration in history. An international consortium of\nscientists at twenty different sequencing centers spread out across\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and\nChina took charge of different portions, breaking up the entire genome\ninto smaller and smaller overlapping segments until stretches several\nthousand base pairs at a time could be sequenced. Then the whole thing\nwas pasted back together using the areas of overlap as guides. The\nHuman Genome Project was officially completed in 2003 (entry:\n the Human Genome Project).\n\nThe successful completion of the Human Genome Project was met with\nlofty language. The media hailed the effort as uncovering the\n\u201cHoly Grail of biology\u201d, and project leaders compared it\nto splitting the atom and putting a human on the moon. At a\ncelebration of the Human Genome Project in 2003 (for video see\n Other Internet Resources),\n Francis Collins\u2014one of the directors of the effort\u2014boldly\npredicted that the major genes for diabetes, mental illness, asthma,\nand many other diseases would all be discovered in the next few years.\nThese genetic findings, he claimed, would in turn completely transform\nthe way those very common diseases were diagnosed and treated. By\n2010, Collins foresaw a world of individualized medicine where genetic\ntesting was common and physicians tailored treatment plans and\nlifestyle changes all to a patient\u2019s unique DNA. And by 2020, he\nhoped \u201cwe will have a gene-based designer drug available for\nalmost any disease that you can name.\u201d A genomic revolution was\npromised, where traditional \u201cone-size-fits-all medicine\u201d\nwas going to be replaced with \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d\n(entry:\n philosophy of medicine).\n\nInterestingly, while the geneticists and news reporters were looking\nahead to the bright future of personalized medicine, the actual\nresults from the Human Genome Project pointed to a much more\ncomplicated and daunting path ahead. Going into the sequencing,\ngeneticists assumed humans carried over 100,000 genes around with\nthem. Humans are more complex than mice or rice, the thought went, so\nthey should have more genes. Instead, the Human Genome Project\nrevealed that humans bore only 20,000 genes, while mice carried 25,000\nand rice more than 30,000. This gene-count surprise was a strong\nindication that there would be much more to personalized medicine than\nsimply assigning different stretches of DNA to different diseases\n(entry:\n genomics and postgenomics).\n\nWe live now in the postgenomic era. Just what\n\u201cpostgenomic\u201d means, though, is a point of contention. On\nthe one hand, many life sciences have embraced genomics, bringing DNA\nsequencing methods and an attention to genes into their\ndomain\u2014conservation genomics, cancer genomics, behavioral\ngenomics, immunological genomics, bacterial genomics, and marine\ngenomics, to name just a few (entries:\n biodiversity;\n philosophy of immunology;\n conservation biology,\n cancer). On the other hand, it\u2019s become abundantly clear\nthat there is a great deal of complexity between a sequence of DNA and\na trait, and that there are far more variables affecting that trait\nthan just the order of As, Cs, Ts, and Gs. This has spawned the\nproliferation of other \u201comic\u201d disciplines that attempt to\ncatalogue and functionally understand the great variety of molecular\nand cellular entities and processes that contribute to the structure\nand function of organisms\u2014proteomics, transcriptomics,\nmetabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics, to name just a few (entry:\n scientific research and big data).\n What\u2019s more, genome-wide association studies, which scour\nentire genomes for regions that are associated with traits, have\nrevealed that in most case, tens, hundreds, or thousands of genomic\nregions are implicated in even fairly simple human traits like height.\nThis tension\u2014between an urge to trace things down to genes and a\nrealization once you get there that there is far more to the story\nthan genes\u2014is at the heart of many philosophical reflections on\ngenetics (Richardson and Stevens 2015; Reardon 2017; entries:\n genomics and postgenomics;\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology;\n heritability).\n2. Philosophical Questions about Genetics\n\nThe prominence of genetics\u2014its impressive rise throughout the\ntwentieth century, its infiltration of other life and health sciences,\nand its practical impact on human lives\u2014made it a natural object\nof scrutiny for philosophers interested in science and the\nrelationship between science and society. Philosophers have attended\nto a great many conceptual, theoretical, metaphysical,\nepistemological, methodological, ethical, legal, political, and social\nquestions pertaining to genetics. A sample of those questions and\ndirection to the entries where they are discussed in greater detail\nfollows.\n2.1 What Is the Relationship between Classical Genetics and Molecular Genetics?\n\nPhilosophy of science, throughout the early- and mid-twentieth\ncentury, was predominated by attention to examples, problems, and\nconcepts from physics. Not surprisingly, the philosophical insights\nproduced a vision of how science worked that was modeled on physics.\nScientific explanations, as one example, arose from the derivation of\nphenomena from physical laws of nature; rainbows are explained by\nreference to the laws of reflection and refraction, alongside the\nposition of the sun, the position of raindrops, and the position of\nthe person seeing the rainbow. Scientific progress, as another\nexample, proceeded by way of higher-level sciences reducing to\nlower-level sciences; thermodynamics (with its concepts of temperature\nand pressure), the thought went, was reduced to statistical mechanics\n(with its concepts of mean kinetic energy and force) (entries:\n scientific reduction;\n intertheory relations in physics;\n scientific progress;\n laws of nature;\n the structure of scientific theories).\n\nIn the 1960s, philosophers of science started turning their attention\nto biology in order to see how the philosophical insights applied\nthere. The earliest, influential example of this was Kenneth\nSchaffner\u2019s proposal for classical, Mendelian genetics reducing\nto molecular genetics (Schaffner 1969). The great successes of\nmolecular biology following Watson and Crick\u2019s discovery of the\ndouble-helical structure of DNA can be best understood, Schaffner\nargued, by recognizing how classical genetics was in the process of\nbeing reduced to the biochemical processes investigated by molecular\nbiologists. On this reading, the \u201cgene\u201d from classical\ngenetics was reduced to a sequence of amino acids in DNA, and other\nconcepts from classical genetics like \u201cdominance\u201d were\nlikewise being reconfigured in the language of biochemistry (entry:\n reductionism in biology).\n\nSchaffner\u2019s case for reduction in genetics invited philosophers\nto take a hard look at the theories and practices of biologists. A\nvariety of challenges to Schaffner\u2019s thesis ensued. David Hull\n(1974) claimed that there was no neat connection between classical\ngenetics\u2019 gene concept and molecular genetics\u2019 DNA\nsequence because there was no neat, one-to-one mapping between\nstretches of DNA and the traits that the classical geneticists\ninvestigated; instead, Hull thought it better to characterize\nmolecular genetics as having replaced classical genetics. Philip\nKitcher (1984) agreed with Hull that reduction was the wrong way to\nunderstand the relationship; however, he offered a different\nformulation of the correct way. Kitcher said it was best to understand\nclassical genetics and molecular genetics as operating on different,\nautonomous levels; classical geneticists investigated the transmission\nof traits by studying the cytological mechanisms of chromosomal\naction, while molecular geneticists investigated things like gene\nreplication and mutation by studying the molecular mechanisms of\nprotein synthesis (entries:\n molecular genetics;\n the unity of science).\n\nThe debate over the relationship between classical genetics and\nmolecular genetics didn\u2019t so much resolve itself as it did\nevolve into a series of new philosophical questions. That is, as\nphilosophers were working through the details of genetics to assess\nthe relationship between the older version and the newer one, they\nencountered a series of questions that demanded consideration: What\nexactly is a \u201cgene\u201d? And what do genes actually do?\nPhilosophers continued to consider the reduction question (for\nexamples of subsequent defenders of reduction, see Waters 1990;\nSchaffner 1993). But these other questions took on a life of their own\nand became legitimate targets of inquiry independent of the reduction\ndebate. Philosophy of biology professionally emerged as a unique\nsub-discipline of philosophy of science in the 1970s and 1980s as this\nunfolded (entry:\n philosophy of biology).\n2.2 What Is a \u201cGene\u201d?\n\nNo concept is more central to genetics than the \u201cgene\u201d.\nAnd yet, the earliest philosophical examinations of genetics quickly\nuncovered the fact that it was by no means clear that the gene from\nclassical genetics was the same thing as the gene from molecular\ngenetics. Subsequent attention to genetics only compounded the puzzle.\nIn the late 1970s, a series of discoveries complicated the simple\nrelationship between a single, uninterrupted sequence of DNA and its\npolypeptide, protein product. Overlapping genes were discovered\n(Barrell et al. 1976); such genes were considered overlapping because\ntwo different amino acid chains might be read from the same stretch of\nnucleic acids by starting from different points on the DNA sequence.\nAnd split genes were found (Berget et al. 1977; Chow et al. 1977). In\ncontrast to the hypothesis that a continuous nucleic acid sequence\ngenerated an amino acid chain, it became apparent that stretches of\nDNA were often split between coding regions (exons) and non-coding\nregions (introns). The distinction between exons and introns became\neven more complicated when alternative splicing was discovered the\nfollowing year (Berk and Sharp 1978). A series of exons could be\nspliced together in a variety of ways, thus generating a variety of\nmolecular products. Discoveries such as overlapping genes, split\ngenes, and alternative splicing made it clear that what counted as a\ngene was by no means straightforward even if focus was confined to\nmolecular genetics (Griffiths and Stotz 2013; Rheinberger and\nM\u00fcller-Wille 2017; entry:\n molecular biology).\n\nPhilosophers responded to these genetic discoveries in different\nways\u2014by proposing multiple gene concepts, or by trying to unify\nthe disparate phenomena under a single gene concept. Lenny\nMoss\u2019s distinction between Gene-P and Gene-D is a classic\nexample of the multiple gene concepts approach (Moss 2002). Gene-P\nembraced an instrumental preformationism; it was defined by its\nrelationship to a phenotype. In contrast, Gene-D referred to a\ndevelopmental resource; it was defined by its molecular sequence. An\nexample will help to distinguish the two: When one talked about\n\u201cthe gene for cystic fibrosis\u201d, the Gene-P concept was\nbeing utilized; the concept referred to the ability to track the\ntransmission of this gene from generation to generation as an\ninstrumental predictor of cystic fibrosis, without being contingent on\nknowing the causal pathway between the particular sequence of DNA and\nthe ultimate phenotypic disease. The Gene-D concept, in contrast,\nreferred instead to just one developmental resource (i.e., the\nmolecular sequence) involved in the complex development of the\ndisease, which interacted with a host of other such resources\n(proteins, RNA, a variety of enzymes, etc.) (entry:\n gene).\n (For other examples of multiple gene concepts, see Fox Keller 2002;\nBaetu 2011; Griffiths and Stotz 2013).\n\nA second philosophical approach for conceptualizing the gene involved\nrethinking a single, unified gene concept that captured the molecular\ncomplexities. For example, Eva Neumann-Held claimed that a\n\u201cprocess molecular gene concept\u201d embraced the\ncomplications; on her unified view, the term \u201cgene\u201d\nreferred to \u201cthe recurring process that leads to the temporally\nand spatially regulated expression of a particular polypeptide\nproduct\u201d (Neumann-Held 1999). Returning to the case of cystic\nfibrosis, a process molecular gene for an individual without the\ndisease referred to one of a variety of transmembrane ion-channel\ntemplates along with all the non-genetic influences on gene\nexpression, involved in the generation of the normal polypeptide\nproduct. And so cystic fibrosis arose when a particular stretch of the\nDNA sequence was missing from this process (entry:\n molecular genetics).\n (For additional examples of gene-concept unification, see Falk 2001;\nPortin and Wilkins 2017.)\n2.3 What Do Genes Do?\n\nAt a celebration of the Human Genome Project completion in 2003 (see\n section 1.5 above),\n genome enthusiasts promised that the major genes for heart disease,\nmental health disorders, and diabetes would all be discovered shortly,\nthat treatments would soon follow, and that genetic cures would be\navailable by 2020. To call those claims \u201chype\u201d would be an\nunderstatement. Genome-wide association studies following the Human\nGenome Project revealed that the most common human diseases were\nimpacted by many, many places in the genome, each of which made a very\nsmall contribution to the risk of having or not having the ailment.\nThat, in turn, meant that there were no simple targets for genetic\ninterventions because there were simply too many genetic points and\npathways from those points. Most strikingly, even the traits for which\nsingle genes were discovered\u2014cystic fibrosis for\nexample\u2014remained stubbornly resilient to cures, even though\nthose genes were identified 30 years prior. Philosophical critics of\ngenetics pointed to this mismatch between genetic promises and genetic\ndeliveries to argue against misleading and harmful notions of genetic\nessentialism (Nelkin an Lindee 2004). \u201cMisleading\u201d because\nstudies about complex relationships between some portion of DNA and\nsome human trait often were simplified down to claims about\ndiscoveries of \u201cthe gene for\u201d that trait. And\n\u201charmful\u201d because the language encouraged continued\ninvestment of public resources in gene-hunting research, when it was\npossible that society would gain more from focusing biomedical\nresearch agendas elsewhere (entries:\n feminist philosophy of biology;\n the human genome project;\n theories of biological development;\n philosophy of medicine;\n sociobiology;\n philosophy of science in Latin America;\n philosophy of biomedicine).\n\nOne source of confusion, according to the critics, were the metaphors\nthat got embedded in molecular genetics in the mid-twentieth century.\nComputing and architectural metaphors suggesting that the genome was a\n\u201cprogram\u201d or \u201cblueprint\u201d for development\nconveyed misleading ideas about how cells operated (Kay 2000).\nInformational metaphors may capture some features of biology, but the\nerror was in thinking that only DNA carried that biological\ninformation (Griffiths 2001; Jablonka 2002; entries:\n biological information;\n innateness and language;\n the distinction between innate and acquired characteristics;\n the historical controversies surrounding innateness).\n\nAn alternative way of making sense of what genes do without the\nbaggage of metaphors is to characterize it in causal language. C.\nKenneth Waters drew on a manipulationist theory of causation that\ntreated causes as manipulable difference-makers, where Waters\u2019\ninsight was to add a distinction between \u201cpotential\ndifference-makers\u201d and \u201cactual difference-makers\u201d\n(Waters 2007). In carefully controlled genetic experiments such as\nMorgan\u2019s classic work on fruit flies (see\n section 1.1 above),\n Waters pointed out that there were many potential difference-makers\nfor a trait under investigation like eye color, but it was the actual\ngenetic difference that was responsible for the actual difference in\neye color. Waters claimed further that the spread of genetics\nthroughout the life sciences was partly attributable to this feature\nof scientists being able to manipulate phenotypes by manipulating\ngenes (entries:\n molecular genetics;\n causation and manipulability). As with the information metaphor, though, philosophical\ncritics have been willing to accept Waters\u2019 distinction between\npotential and actual difference-makers, but then challenged the idea\nthat only genes acted as actual difference-makers (Griffiths and Stotz\n2013; entry:\n developmental biology).\n\nResearch agendas for investigating the living world now commonly\nreference genes as one unit, element, or level to be considered by\nbiologists (entries:\n levels of organization in biology;\n philosophy of microbiology). The Research Domain Criteria of psychiatry lists genes\nas one unit of analysis alongside cells, circuits, and physiology\n(entry:\n philosophy of psychiatry).\n Conservation biologists attend to different targets of\nconservation\u2014genes, but also species, sub-species, populations,\nand biomes (entries:\n conservation biology;\n biodiversity). The ubiquity of these references to genes in scientific\npractices that range from understanding major depressive disorder to\nsaving the Great Barrier Reef serves as an affirmation of\nWaters\u2019 point about the power of genetics to act as a point of\nintervention in the world. At the same time, the fact that genes are\nbut one item in these lists of possible points of intervention reminds\nus that they are not unique (entry:\n inheritance systems).\n2.4 Are Genes the Target of Natural Selection?\n\nOn Darwin\u2019s original formulation, natural selection acted on\nindividual organisms (entries:\n Darwinism;\n natural selection). As a population of organisms struggled to survive in\nsome particular environment, some of the organisms had traits that\nmade them slightly fitter in that environment, and this meant they\nwere more likely to survive and reproduce; the offspring of those\norganisms in turn inherited the traits of their parents, and so the\ncharacter of the population changed over time, eventually forming a\nnew or different species if the process went on long enough (entries:\n evolution;\n fitness). For example, in an environment that is growing\nincreasingly cold, animals with thicker fur might have an advantage\nover the animals with less fur because of their ability to tolerate\nthe temperature; these thicker-furred animals would be more likely to\nsurvive in that cold environment and also more likely to reproduce\noffspring that inherit their parents\u2019 thicker coats. Eventually,\nthe entire population of those animals may display this thicker fur\n(entry:\n adaptationism).\n\nEven Darwin recognized, however, that nature presented some cases that\ndid not fit this picture. In particular, seemingly altruistic\nbehaviors in the animal kingdom posed a puzzle (Wilson 2015). Take\nsocial mammals like ground squirrels that whistle alarm calls to\nnotify other members of the group of a nearby threat. On the original\nDarwinian formulation of natural selection, alarm calling should not\narise because it is not beneficial to the ground squirrels that\ndisplay the behavior. A ground squirrel that is more prone to\nnotifying its counterparts of a looming threat is presumably also more\nlikely to get killed by that threat, and so the proneness to warn\nshouldn\u2019t get propagated in the population if all the altruistic\nground squirrels are dying by very virtue of their altruistic behavior\n(entry:\n biological altruism).\n\nW. D. Hamilton proposed kin selection as a resolution to the altruism\npuzzle (Hamilton 1964). If the population of ground squirrels above\nwere related, then the genes associated with alarm calling could\npropagate in the group even if the altruistic ground squirrels were\nkilled more often because their kin who shared the genes survived. G.\nC. Williams and Richard Dawkins subsequently generalized\nHamilton\u2019s observation, arguing that all of natural selection\ncould be understood as operating at the genetic level (Williams 1966;\nDawkins 1976). On this \u201cgene\u2019s-eye view of\nevolution\u201d, natural selection targets genes (the\n\u201creplicators\u201d in Dawkins\u2019 language), while organisms\nare the \u201cvehicles\u201d (or \u201cinteractors\u201d) that\ncarry around the genes and interact with the environment (entry:\n replication and reproduction).\n\nThe gene\u2019s-eye formulation of natural selection sparked an\nexplosion of philosophical attention to evolutionary biology (which\nhappened to roughly coincide with the attention to the relationship\nbetween classic and molecular genetics discussed in\n section 2.1).\n This \u201clevels\u201d or \u201cunits of selection\u201d debate\nrevolved around a number of questions (Keller 1999; Okasha 2006;\nentry:\n units and levels of selection).\n For example, at what level does natural selection act? Genes,\nindividuals, groups, entire species (entry:\n biological notion of individual)?\n Group selectionists argued altruistic behavior could arise if one\ngroup was fitter than another group because it had more altruistic\nmembers in that group (Sober and Wilson 1998). Stephen Jay Gould made\nthe case for selection acting on entire species when, for example,\necological specialists were more common than generalists (Gould 2002).\nOther philosophers questioned the entire replicator/interactor\ndistinction; Developmental Systems Theorists advocated instead for\nseeing the developmental system as a whole (genes and the environment)\nas the evolving unit (Oyama, Griffiths, and Gray eds. 2001; see the\nentries on\n developmental biology;\n evolution and development;\n phylogenetic inference).\n2.5 Who Benefits from Medical Genetics? Who is Harmed by It?\n\nEugenics had many things wrong with it (see\n section 1.2 above).\n In part it was based on a poor understanding of human genetics.\nBeyond that, though, it was also morally abhorrent. Eugenics was\ngrounded on biased ideas about what made lives worth living. And it\nput decision-making power over what lives were worth living into the\nhands of government bodies and institutions. Dozens of states in\nAmerica passed some form of sterilization law that targeted people\ndeemed undesirable, so that society wouldn\u2019t be burdened by\npeople with physical and intellectual disabilities (Largent 2011).\nStates also enacted anti-miscegenation laws to prevent interracial\nmarriages that could contribute to \u201crace suicide\u201d (Pascoe\n2009; entry:\n eugenics).\n\nArchitects of the pivot to medical genetics and genetic counseling\nprograms in the mid-twentieth century tried to curtail some of the\nabhorrent features of this history by shifting control over\nreproductive decisions from governments/institutions to\nindividuals/families (see\n section 1.4 above).\n A technology like amniocentesis allowed a woman to decide whether or\nnot she wanted to carry a fetus that was likely to have Down syndrome\nto term or alternatively terminate the pregnancy. Carrier screening\nfor cystic fibrosis let prospective parents know what the chances were\nthat they could conceive a child with that condition. For families\nwith Huntington\u2019s disease, preimplantation genetic diagnosis\nafter in vitro fertilization opened the door to only implanting\nembryos that did not carry the Huntington\u2019s disease allele.\nGenetic counselors saw their role as facilitating these\npatients\u2019 reproductive decision-making in a non-biased way.\nMedical geneticists hailed these genetic technologies, claiming they\nempowered families (and women in particular) with greater autonomous\ncontrol over their reproductive decisions (entry:\n pregnancy, birth, and medicine).\n\nCritics from disability studies, however, argued that medical\ngenetics\u2019 break from eugenics was not so clean-cut (Barnes 2016;\nParens and Asch 1999; Silvers 2016). When hospitals offered pregnant\nwomen the opportunity to screen for traits like Down syndrome and\ncystic fibrosis but not other traits like sex or eye-color, it sent a\nmessage to prospective parents that some traits\u2014like Down\nsyndrome and cystic fibrosis\u2014should be considered for\ntermination while other traits\u2014like sex and\neye-color\u2014should not (Parens and Asch 2000). Genetic counselors\naspired to offer genetic information in a non-directive fashion, but\ndisability-oriented critics argued that information shared with\nprospective parents about living with a disability was often skewed\nagainst disability (Asch 1989). The general message disability studies\nscholars highlighted was that medical genetics reinforced the idea\nthat disability was something to be avoided, not accommodated (Scully\n2008). This was seen as just the modern instantiation of the\nstraightforwardly eugenic idea that some lives are not worth living\n(Saxton 1997; Wendell 1996). What\u2019s more, the critics pointed\nout that standardizing these genetic technologies in the healthcare\nsystem actually put pressure on prospective parents to use them, which\nmeant the reproductive decisions were not as autonomous as genetic\ndefenders proclaimed (entries:\n disability: health, well-being, and personal relationships;\n feminist perspectives on disability).\n\nMedical genetics faced other criticisms as well. The standardization\nof genetic technologies contributed to the medicalization of\nconception, pregnancy, and birth; this altered the relationship\nbetween expecting parents and fetuses because a pregnancy became\nthought of as \u201ctentative\u201d until screening was complete,\nand it also impacted the way expecting parents prepared for and\ncommunicated about a pregnancy (Duden 1993). Racial health disparity\nscholars also criticized biomedical research investment in medical\ngenetics because it pulled resources away from known causes of health\ndisparities in the environment that had a bigger impact on the problem\n(Roberts 2011). In some cases, the concerns about medicalization and\nthe concerns about racial health disparities converged; for example,\nDorothy Roberts warned that it takes social and economic resources to\naccess the sorts of genetic technologies that hospitals offer (at\nleast in the United States), and so medical genetics only exacerbated\nhealth disparities (Roberts 2009; entries:\n feminist bioethics;\n the human genome project). Concerns about privacy have also expanded rapidly as\ngenomic information about people is increasingly in the hands of\nhospitals and private companies\n (entries: privacy and medicine;\n privacy and information technology).\n2.6 Should Genetics Be Utilized for Human Enhancement?\n\nA common distinction in the medical world is that between\n\u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201cenhancement\u201d, where the\ngeneral idea is that biomedical interventions that are designed to\nrestore or sustain health count as treatments while those that go\nbeyond restoring or sustaining health count as enhancements (entry:\n human enhancement).\n The discussion in the previous section about disability largely\npertained to the treatment end of that spectrum (entry:\n neuroethics).\n Philosophical debates about medical genetics have also revolved\naround the enhancement end (Buchanan 2011).\n\nTo a certain extent, the ability to screen for genes associated with\ncertain traits meant some form of genetic enhancement was always\npossible, even if it seemed impractical (think worries about\nblue-eyed, blond-haired \u201cdesigner babies\u201d, which were\ncommon in the 1990s when the Human Genome Project was launched). The\nemergence of relatively fast and cheap gene-editing technologies like\nCRISPR-Cas9 has made the debates over genetic enhancement feel much\nmore pressing (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and\nMedicine 2017). The ethical stakes have not really changed, but the\nsense that discussions have shifted from purely hypothetical to\npotentially realistic has changed.\n\nPhilosophical critics of enhancement offer a number of cautions\nagainst the practice. Michael Sandel famously associated desires for\nenhancement with hubris, where contentment with what nature (and\nchance) present was the more virtuous attitude (Sandel 2002). Parental\nattempts to genetically enhance a child were also criticized on the\ngrounds that they violated the autonomy of the child because parents\nwere seeking too much control over the child\u2019s future (Habermas\n2003). Philosophers also warned of an unjust future made up of genetic\n\u201chaves\u201d (those who have benefited from enhancement) and\n\u201chave nots\u201d (those who remained unenhanced)\u2014a\nscenario popularized in the film GATTACA (entry:\n theory and bioethics).\n\nDefenders of enhancement were quick to point out that many of the\narguments against enhancing were not reasonably confined to just\ngenetic technologies. Parents control their child\u2019s future when\nthey send her to space camp rather than soccer camp; likewise, wealthy\nparents are able to enhance their children with all sorts of\neducational resources, like tutors, that poor parents cannot provide,\nand these surely contribute to disparities. But parents are given wide\nlatitude to decide what camp their child will attend and how much they\nwill (or won\u2019t) invest in their child\u2019s educational\ndevelopment. Julian Savulescu (2001) even argued that parents are\nobligated to take advantage of genetic technologies if they offer\nopportunities to increase the chances of a child living the best life.\nOf course, just what counts as the \u201cbest life\u201d is an\ninherently value-laden judgment, and critics pointed out that\nSavulescu\u2019s characterization of it looked frighteningly similar\nto the vision promoted by eugenicists a century ago (entries:\n parenthood and procreation;\n eugenics).\n2.7 Is Race \u201cin the Genes\u201d?\n\nEugenicists understood races to be biologically distinct human\npopulations with rank-able physical and behavioral profiles (see\n section 1.2 above).\n Black people were more prone to criminality and lower intelligence\nthan White people, they believed; and a child who was born of\nmixed-race parents was likely to fall somewhere in between. The\nanti-miscegenation laws promoted by eugenicists were explicitly\ndesigned to prevent White people from breeding with Black people.\nBlack people were not the only targets though. Eugenicists also spoke\nof the \u201cIrish race\u201d, the \u201cItalian race\u201d, and\nthe \u201cSlavic race\u201d. These racial categories were just as\nreal for the eugenicists as the categories of Black, White, and Asian,\nand anti-immigration laws were passed to keep undesirable races away\n(entry:\n race).\n\nThe simplistic ideas about race held by eugenicists did not hold up to\nscientific scrutiny. Twentieth century developments in fields like\nhuman evolution, anthropology, and sociology proved that races were\nnot so cleanly distinguishable\u2014that there were no racial atomic\nnumbers that carved up Black and White in the same way that proton\nnumber neatly distinguished gold from mercury. Still, interest in race\nand genetics persisted. Insights from the study of human evolution\nrevealed how the earliest humans moved out of Africa roughly 70,000\nyears ago in a series of migrations, some moving east across the Asian\ncontinent, some moving north up into what is now Europe, some\neventually crossing the Bering Strait and entering the Americas. As\nthese human populations moved about, they encountered very different\nenvironments with unique selection pressures (Herrera and\nGarcia-Bertrand 2018). What counted as adaptive in the fjords of\nNorthern Europe looked quite different from what was adaptive in the\ndeserts of Northern Africa, and so the human populations over time\nadapted to the distinct environments\u2014some developing darker skin\nwhile others grew lighter, some developing a resistance to cholera\nwhile others developed a resistance to malaria.\n\nThe revised conceptions of race and genetics worked off this\nevolutionary story, where the idea was that racial categories\nrepresented human groups with unique genetic profiles tied to those\ndifferent selection histories (Hardimon 2017). A Black person, the\nthought went, came from African ancestry, while a White person came\nfrom European ancestry. In turn, the Black person was likely to have a\ndifferent genetic profile when it came to melanin production (which\ncontrols skin shade) than the White person, and the Black person was\nmore likely to be a carrier for sickle-cell anemia (a blood disorder\nthat also offers some resistance to malaria) while the White person\nwas more likely to be a carrier for cystic fibrosis (a respiratory\ndisorder that also offers some resistance to cholera) (Spencer 2018).\nProponents of these newer ideas about race and genetics were eager to\nsay that they were not in the business of ranking races; they were\njust tracing different racial histories and the modern phenotypic\nresults of them (entry:\n the social dimensions of scientific knowledge).\n\nEven the revised understanding of race and genetics, however, faced\nchallenges. First, the groupings from human evolution did not map\nneatly onto the traditional folk concepts of race; for example, if\n\u201cWhite\u201d applied to people descended from the migration\nthat ultimately wound up in Northern Europe, then that would mean\nchildren born today in Bangalore, Oslo, and Damascus all count as\n\u201cWhite\u201d\u2014a counterintuitive grouping of\n\u201cWhite\u201d people (Smith 2011). Critics also pointed out that\nthe folk concepts of race evolved over time, largely in response to\npolitical and economic pressures (like census counting and justifying\nslavery), not biological insights (like paleogenetic discoveries)\n(Roberts 2011). Some critics have encouraged distinguishing\n\u201crace\u201d from \u201cancestry\u201d, confining talk of\ngenetics (e.g., genetic ancestral testing, genetic medicine) to the\nancestry side of that distinction and keeping it out of discussions of\nrace (Yudell et al. 2016; entries:\n identity politics;\n philosophy of biology in Latin America).\n3. Conclusion\n\nAs the second century of genetics unfolds, there is little reason to\nthink the influential science will slow down. In New Zealand,\ngovernment leaders proposed using gene-editing technologies to\neradicate invasive species from the island nation (Yong 2017). In the\nUnited States, the All of Us Research Program rolled out, with the aim\nbeing to collect DNA from 1,000,000 Americans and link that\ninformation up with medical records so as to usher in a new genomic\nparadigm of precision medicine (Pear 2016). In China, scientists\ninserted a human gene involved in brain development into monkeys in\norder to see how the addition of that human gene altered the\nmonkey\u2019s own development (CBC Radio in\n Other Internet Resources).\n These programs, practices, and proposals raised profound questions\nabout the dangers of intervening on complex ecosystems, the politics\nof distributing scarce biomedical resources, and the ethics of\nnon-human animal research. As genetics progresses, so too will the\nphilosophical questions about it.\n",
