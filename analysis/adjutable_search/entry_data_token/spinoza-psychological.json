The Human Being as Part of Nature\n\n\nIn the Preface to Part III, Spinoza states his view that all things\nalike must be understood to follow from the laws of nature: \nThe laws and rules of nature, according to which all things\nhappen, and change from one form to another, are always and everywhere\nthe same. So the way of understanding the nature of anything, of\nwhatever kind, must also be the same, viz. through the universal laws\nof nature.\n\n Many philosophers have treated the human mind as an exception to\notherwise universal natural laws, as a thing that is conscious, that\nis capable of good and evil, or that can be an uncaused cause of\naction, for example. Spinoza though insists that human beings are not\n\u201coutside nature.\u201d Any features or deeds of human beings that seem\nexceptional, then, must have for Spinoza some explanation in terms of\nuniversal, natural laws. That is, if there is any sense at all in\nsaying that a human being is aware, does good, and is free, then\nthere must be universal, natural laws that justify and explain these\ndesignations.\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s thesis (IIIp7) that the essence of any finite mode,\nincluding any human mind (IIIp9), is a striving (conatus) to\npersevere in being is an attempt to give an account of nature under\nwhich human beings with their apparent peculiarities are natural.\nSpinoza argues that all finite modes strive to persevere in being\n(IIIp6), and he uses an analysis of human striving to explain the\nconscious experience of desire, human freedom, and good and evil in\nterms that might apply to any finite modes. Desire, as Spinoza\nunderstands it, just is striving together with consciousness of\nstriving (IIIp9s; the human experience of desire is discussed in more\ndetail in Section 2.1). An action of a human mind cannot be free, for\nSpinoza, in the sense of being determined by a faculty of will that is\nitself undetermined (IIp48; see also letter 58, to Schuller). There is human freedom for Spinoza,\nhowever, in the sense of freedom from external interference: I am free\nin producing some effect (that is, in doing something) to the extent that the effect\nfollows from my essence, or, in other words, to the extent that it is the effect\nof my striving. (For discussions of action and human freedom,\nsee IIId2 and V Preface.) \u2018Good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019\nare labels that describe natural properties in the sense that they\ndescribe changes that might occur in any particular things at all\n(although we reserve the labels for these changes when they occur in\nhuman beings).  Although scholars debate the precise meaning of these\nidentifications, an increase in the power with which a mind strives is\ngood, for Spinoza, and a decrease evil (see IIIp11s, IIIp39s and IV\nPreface).  Because the striving thesis thus makes central\ncontributions to Spinoza\u2019s accounts of consciousness, of human freedom\nand of good and evil, it is of great importance to Spinoza\u2019s\npsychology and ethics. One might raise questions about the validity of\nSpinoza\u2019s argument to the doctrine, about its plausibility as an\naccount of the nature of particular objects, or about its plausibility\nas an account of human nature. The subsections which follow address\nthese issues in turn.\n1.1 The Argument to the Striving Doctrine\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s argument to IIIp6 is uncharacteristically insulated from the\nrest of the Ethics. As Spinoza presents the argument at\nIIIp6d, it depends principally upon IIIp4, a proposition which Spinoza\ntakes to be self-evident, and IIIp5 which derives from IIIp4 alone. The\nargument also involves, less directly, IP25C and its gloss at IP34. \nI Proposition 25 Corollary: Particular things are nothing\nbut affections of God\u2019s attributes, or modes by which God\u2019s attributes are expressed in a certain and determinate way. \n\n\n\nI Proposition 34: God\u2019s power is his essence itself.\n\n\nIII Proposition 4: No thing can be destroyed except through an\nexternal cause.\n\n\nIII Proposition 5: Things are of a contrary nature, i.e., cannot be\nin the same subject, insofar as one can destroy the other.\n\n\nTherefore, III Proposition 6: Each thing, as far as it can by its own\npower, strives to persevere in its being.\n\n\n\nA thing\u2019s essence may not be absolutely equivalent to its nature for\nSpinoza, since a thing such as a square circle has a nature but cannot\nexist (Ip11) and one might interpret Spinoza as holding that anything\nwhich has an essence might exist (IId2). Still, the two terms might be\ntaken interchangeably here because Spinoza is only describing\nexistents. If this assumption is correct, then perhaps Spinoza\u2019s\nreasoning runs like this:\nParticular things are expressions of power,\nsince they are modes of God\u2019s attributes (Ip25) and God\u2019s attributes\nconstitute God\u2019s essence (ID4) and God\u2019s essence is his power (Ip34).\nIt is self-evident that nothing can be destroyed except through an\nexternal cause (IIIp4), so an apparent particular thing which is\nself-destructive is in fact at least two (IIIp5). The power a genuine\nparticular thing expresses, then, must therefore be directed toward its\nown perseverance in being (IIIp6).\n\nPace Spinoza, the claim at IIIp4 that no thing can be\ndestroyed except through an external cause is not clearly self-evident.\nEven assuming IIIp4 to be true, however, one might raise questions\nabout Spinoza\u2019s argument. Why is it that, just because a thing does not\nstrive to destroy itself, that thing must therefore strive to persevere\nin being? A thing might, it seems, not strive for anything, or perhaps it\nmight strive to do something which is neither perseverance nor\nself-destruction. Spinoza\u2019s use of IP34 and Ip25c seems intended to\nrule out the first of these possibilities. Although Spinoza\u2019s term\n\u2018express\u2019 (exprimere) is notoriously unclear, it\nmay mean something like \u201cis a particular form of.\u201d In that case,\nbecause particular things are expressions of God\u2019s essence, his power,\nthey must be particular forms of power. So there cannot be a thing\nwhich does not strive at all or, in other words, there cannot be a\nthing which is not any expression of power at all.\n\n\nThe second version of the objection, the version which notes the\npossibility that a particular thing as described in IIIp4 might strive\nfor something other than either self-destruction or perseverance,\nremains a challenge to sympathetic readers of the Ethics\nhowever. The rejection of IIIp6 and an insistence that at least some\nthing does not strive to persevere in its being, where perseverance in\nbeing is understood as a particular end among many possible options,\nis perfectly consistent with the truth of IIIp4. After all, not\nstriving to persevere in being, which IIIp6 rules out, is not the same\nthing as striving not to persevere in being, which IIIp4 rules out. A\nsympathetic reader of Spinoza might try to resolve the difficulty\nthrough an understanding of what it means to strive to persevere in\nbeing, under which striving to persevere in being comes to mean just\nthe same thing as striving to do something other than destroy oneself,\nin particular, striving to maintain a present state. (See Curley 1,\n109, for an interpretation similar to this one.) This reading comes\ncloser to making the argument from IIIp4 to IIIp6 seem valid, but it\nraises a new problem: that of reconciling this interpretation of\nstriving with Spinoza\u2019s accounts of human motivation which follow from\nIIIp6. For Spinoza consistently regards sane human beings as finite\nmodes who, beyond merely not trying to kill themselves, actively try\nto preserve themselves. People do not merely resist changes to\nwhatever state they are in; they strive to change their states in\norder to know more and in order to live with a greater force. One of\nthe main problems Spinoza faces, then, is reconciling the most\nplausible version of IIIp6 as an account of the natures of ordinary\nobjects (under which IIIp6 is a principle of inertia) with the most\nplausible version of IIIp6 as an account of human nature (under which\nIIIp6 is a version of psychological egoism).\n1.2 The Striving Doctrine as an Account of the Natures of Particular Objects\n\n\nDespite worries that one might have about the validity of Spinoza\u2019s\nargument, the doctrine has at least some claim to plausibility as an\naccount of the nature of particular things. The Ethics stands\nbadly in need of some account of what finite modes are, after all, and\nIIIp4 provides at least one interesting way of distinguishing genuine\nobjects from mere constructs: if the thing in question destroys itself\nit is not a genuine object. Thus, by IIIp4, a thing that destroys\nitself\u2014one might think a lit candle or a time bomb such a\nthing\u2014is not a genuine object but a thing which does not destroy\nitself is. To the extent that IIIp4 makes most of the things we\nintuitively consider genuine objects genuine objects, it captures\nordinary views. To the extent that it rules out some clear class of\nthings that we intuitively consider genuine objects (lit candles and\ntime bombs), it represents a controversial philosophical thesis. The\nplausibility of the doctrine depends on whether we find that there\nreally is reason to find basic metaphysical differences in kind\nbetween \u201cthings\u201d which tend to destroy themselves and things which do\nnot.  One strategy for defending the plausibility of IIIp4 may be to\ninvestigate what Spinoza means there by an \u201cexternal cause.\u201d\nSpinoza\u2019s various claims about essences, properties, and accidents\nsuggest that at least some of the cases of destruction that we might\nconsider self-destruction are, for Spinoza, destruction by external\ncauses (Garrett, 2002, pursues this strategy), a suggestion that is supported by Spinoza\u2019s account of suicide later in the Ethics at IVp20s.   The class of things which tend to destroy themselves may be different from, and narrower\nthan, one might think it is on a first reading of IIIp4.\n\n\nIIIp6 introduces, perhaps, a slightly different thesis about what it\nmeans to be a particular thing: a particular thing is one which\nstrives to persevere in being. IIIp6\u2019s dependence upon IIIp4 suggests\nthat this thesis means that any object will remain in the same state\nunless external causes affect it. Such a thesis appears to be a\nprinciple of inertia, and, indeed, Spinoza seems to invoke a principle\nof inertia in the terms he uses at IIIp6.\n\u2018Conatus\u2019 is a technical term of Cartesian\nphysics, referring to an object\u2019s motion. Spinoza himself uses the\nterm in this way in his exposition of Descartes\u2019s Principles of\nPhilosophy. (Compare, for example, Descartes\u2019s\nPrinciples II, art. 37, III, art. 56 and III, art. 58 to\nSpinoza\u2019s exposition IIp14c, IIID3 and IIp17,\nrespectively). Moreover, at IIIp6, in addition to using the term\n\u2018conatus\u2019 again, Spinoza also uses the same\nphrase that he uses in framing a different principle of inertia at\nIIp14 of his exposition of Descartes\u2019s physics: \u201cas far as\nit can by its own power\u201d quantum in se est. This phrase\nis also one that Descartes himself uses at Principles II,\nart. 37. (Note however that there is some controversy over how this\nphrase is to be understood: see Curley\u2019s footnote to IIIp6 in\nhis translation and Garrett, 1999, note 2.) So there is a good textual\nbasis for the conclusion that IIIp6 indeed has this meaning.\n\n\nApart from the question of how a principle of inertia can give us an\nunderstanding of human nature, this interpretation of IIIp6 raises a\ndifficult question about Spinoza\u2019s use of the striving doctrine.  One\nmight object that IIIp6, understood as a restatement of a principle\nof inertia, extends a physical principle to mind without sufficient\nclarity. In stating their versions of a principle of inertia in physics, both Descartes and Spinoza are careful to limit the claim to a claim about bodies.\nSpinoza, for example, in his definition of conatus ad motum,\nIIId3 of his exposition of Descartes, writes:\nBy striving for motion we do not understand any thought,\nbut only that a part of matter is so placed and stirred to motion, that\nit really would go somewhere if it were not prevented by any\ncause.\n\n\nIn addition to characterizing matter, however, IIIp6 is a foundational\nclaim about the nature of mind and, in particular, about human\npsychology. There is a basis, in Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics, for thinking\nthat whatever is true about bodies is true about minds also in some\nsense (and see IIIp10 and IIIp11 for Spinoza\u2019s account of striving and\nthe mind/body relation). Striving in physics, however, is understood\nas a tendency to a certain kind of motion, and motion seems, if\nanything does, to belong to bodies alone. So Spinoza needs to supply\nan account of the mental correlate to the physical \u201cstriving for\nmotion.\u201d But IIIp6 leaves open the question of what it means for\na mind to strive. On this objection, the striving doctrine uses a kind\nof metaphorical language, the term \u2018striving\u2019, where a\nprecise and literal account of what it is that is characteristic of\nmind is required.\n1.3 The Striving Doctrine as an Account of Human Nature\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s naturalism benefits rhetorically from his use of the term\n\u2018conatus\u2019 to describe the essences of human\nbeings and other finite modes alike. For the term is not only a\ntechnical term of Cartesian physics. Cicero uses the term in De\nNatura Deorum (and other Roman and Greek Stoics use close\ncognates) in a psychological sense, referring to human desire, and\nHobbes in his physiology uses the term to refer to the physical causes\nof human desire (Leviathan VI). So\n\u2018conatus\u2019 has both broad, physical and\nspecifically human, psychological connotations which help to make the\ngap between nature and the human mind appear narrow.\n\n\nWhether Spinoza successfully capitalizes on his rhetorical skill,\nhowever, and draws a plausible account of the nature of the human mind\nout of his general account of the essences of finite modes depends upon\nIIIp9:\nIII Proposition 9: Both insofar as the mind has clear and\ndistinct ideas, and insofar as it has confused ideas, it strives, for\nan indefinite duration, to persevere in its being and it is conscious\nof this striving it has.\n\n\nIIIp9 suggests that Spinoza is a psychological egoist of some sort.\nThat is, it suggests that he believes that what human beings desire to\ndo is to secure their own interests (construed here as perseverance in\nbeing). Indeed Spinoza goes on to define desire at IIIp9 as human\nstriving (or appetite) together with the consciousness of striving. So\nclearly human desire for Spinoza is part of the striving for\nperseverance in being and thus shares its character.\n\n\nThere is some question, however, about what variety of psychological\negoism Spinoza holds. Desire might be part of a striving for\nperseverance, after all, without all desires being desires for\nperseverance. One might have a strong instinctual desire for things\nwhich are instrumental to perseverance in being without desiring\nperseverance itself, for example. Or one might desire perseverance in\nbeing but also desire other kinds of things.\n\n\nIIIp9 might be supposed to support a very strong version of\npsychological egoism, orthodox egoism (perhaps Delahunty, 221, holds\nthis view). Orthodox egoism, is the view that human beings are always\nconsciously selfish. Under this view, A consciously desires only those\nobjects which benefit A, B desires only those objects which benefit B,\nand so on for all human beings. At IIIp9, Spinoza writes that the\nhuman mind seeks to persevere in being both insofar as it has clear\nand distinct ideas and insofar as it has confused ideas. It is natural\nto understand this claim to mean something like the following:\nSometimes people do things which conduce to their\nperseverance and other times people do things which fail to so\nconduce.  In both types of case, though, people desire to\npersevere. When I do something that fails to help me to persevere,\nit\u2019s because the ideas on which I based my action were confused; that\nis, I thought I knew what would help me to persevere, but I was\nwrong. When I do something that does help me to persevere, though\n(unless I have simply been lucky in acting from an inadequate idea),\nit is because I acted on clear and distinct ideas or, in other words,\ngenuine knowledge about what would help me to persevere.\n\n\nThe categorical language Spinoza uses in the Appendix to Part I\nprovides explicit support for this interpretation of IIIp9: \u201cmen act\nalways on account of an end, viz. on account of their advantage, which\nthey want.\u201d Moreover there are other important passages in Spinoza\u2019s\nworks which are strongly compatible with the interpretation of Spinoza\nas an orthodox egoist. These include Ethics IVp8d, and his\npolitical writings, especially Ethics IVp36s2, and his\nPolitical Treatise, chapter 2)\n\n\nOther evidence suggests that Spinoza is not an orthodox egoist,\nhowever. In particular, there is reason to question whether the\nargument of the Ethics commits Spinoza to the account of\nactions following from confused ideas that the interpretation of IIIp9\nabove attributes to him. Part of IVp44s concerns those agents who are\nthe most confused. That passage is useful because it describes\nexplicitly the conscious thought-processes that precede action:\nThough men are liable to a great many affects, so that one\nrarely finds them to be always agitated by one and the same affect,\nstill there are those in whom one affect is stubbornly fixed. For we\nsometimes see that men are so affected by one object that, although it\nis not present, they still believe they have it with them. When this\nhappens to a man who is not asleep, we say that he is mad or insane.\nNor are they thought to be less mad who burn with Love, and dream, both\nnight and day, only of a lover or a courtesan. For they usually\nprovoke laughter. But when a greedy man thinks of nothing else but\nprofit, or money, and an ambitious man of esteem, they are not thought\nto be mad, because they are usually troublesome and are considered\nworthy of Hate.  But Greed, Ambition, and Lust really are species of\nmadness, even though they are not numbered among the\ndiseases.\n\n\nIn this scholium (and in several other notable passages, including III\nDefinition of the Affects XLVIII and IVp20s) Spinoza describes a\nvariety of possible ends of human action, none of which is\nperseverance in being. Moreover, lest one think that the greedy man\nseeks profit because he mistakenly believes that it leads to\nperseverance, Spinoza emphasizes the point here that it is always one and\nthe same object that obsesses these men.  A man seeking profit because\nhe believes that it leads to perseverance may be obsessed with two\nobjects, profit and perseverance, not one.\n\n\nIVp44s suggests that Spinoza holds a different kind of view,\npredominant egoism, the view that most people, most of the time\nconsciously desire perseverance in their own being. The particular\ntype of predominant egoism that IVp44s suggests introduces important\naspects of Spinoza\u2019s ethical theory: if the most confused\npeople, people addled by greed or lust or ambition, are those who\nalways seek something other than perseverance in being, then perhaps\nSpinoza\u2019s view is that, for any of us who act on some similar\nsentiments occasionally, we do so just to the extent that we also have\nconfused ideas. Thus human beings are predominantly egoistic because,\nby and large, we act rationally. It is rational to seek to persevere\nin being (see also what \u201creason demands\u201d at IVP18S). So if\nwe were always rational, we would always pursue our own preservation,\nand orthodox egoism would be true, for Spinoza. But we are not\northodox egoists, on this interpretation of Spinoza as a predominant\negoist, just because we are not fully rational. To the extent that we\nhave confused ideas, we may indeed consciously pursue ends other than\nperseverance in being. On this interpretation of Spinoza, there is a\nright (or at least a rational) end to pursue\u2014perseverance in\nbeing\u2014and other ends are wrong (or at least irrational).\n\n\nIVp20 provides support for this interpretation of Spinoza\u2019s\npredominant egoism:\nIV Proposition 20: The more each one strives, and is able,\nto seek his own advantage, i.e., to preserve his being, the more he is\nendowed with virtue; conversely, insofar as each one neglects his own\nadvantage, i.e., neglects to preserve his own being, he lacks\npower.\n\n\nHere Spinoza explicitly admits that a person may \u201cneglect his own\nadvantage.\u201d So IVp20 apparently contradicts the orthodox egoism of I\nAppendix. Moreover, IVp20 states that, to the extent that a person\ndoes seek perseverance in being, that person is virtuous. Virtue has a\nmetaphysical connotation in the Ethics. A thing\u2019s virtue is\njust the same as its power (IVd8). But the term undeniably has moral\nconnotations as well. So IVp20 suggests, as IVp44s does, that\nconsciously trying to preserve oneself is right and neglecting to\npreserve oneself is wrong.\n\n\nIIIp9 admits of various interpretations. However, the weight of the\ntextual evidence supports the view that he is a predominant, not an\northodox, egoist. Any particular human desire, even a desire\nthat is not a desire for perseverance in being or its means, must on\nSpinoza\u2019s view be related to perseverance in being in some way (by\nIIIp6 and IIIp9s). Spinoza\u2019s discussion of desires for things other\nthan perseverance in being in passages such as IVp44s and IVp20\nsuggests moreover that such desires are part or product of confusion.\nSo passionate desires, for Spinoza, are often desires for things other\nthan perseverance in being, although they may be confused desires for\nperseverance as well (see IVp63s2 and other discussions of\nfear). Recent debates about whether the ends of human desire are\nreally important to his psychological theory and about how Spinoza\nunderstands human consciousness are likely to lend further support to\nthis view by showing how these passages and others like them may be\nreconciled with Spinoza\u2019s more basic commitments in metaphysics and\nmind.\n\nFurther reading: For discussion of IIIp4,\nsee Matson 1977 and Garrett 2002.

Some of the best general discussions of psychological\negoism come in the context of the interpretation of Hobbes, to whom\nSpinoza is sometimes compared. For these, see Kavka 1986 and Hampton\n1986.\n2. The Affects\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s account of the affects (affectus) of the human mind\nis a response to one of the central problems for his naturalism. It is\nan attempt to show how the wide range of desires and emotions of the\nhuman mind can be produced by something which follows the order of\nnature. At the start of Part III (see also Chapter 2 of his\nPolitical Treatise), Spinoza notes that traditional accounts\nof the passions, with the exception of Descartes\u2019s, have rested on the\nassumption\u2014one wholly baseless in Spinoza\u2019s view\u2014that\nhuman beings are a separate \u201cdominion\u201d within the dominion of nature,\nwith different kinds of constituents and governed by different sorts\nof laws.  Spinoza\u2019s project continues what he finds to be Descartes\u2019s\nimportant innovation: seeking \u201cto explain human affects through their\nfirst causes.\u201d So his account of the affects may be most profitably\ncompared to Descartes\u2019s in his Passions of the Soul. It may\nalso be usefully compared to accounts in the writings of Hobbes\n(especially Leviathan VI), a contemporary who shared many of\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophical commitments, or to some of the \u201ctraditional\naccounts\u201d which Spinoza faults, such as Aquinas\u2019s Summa\nTheologiae.  (Aquinas\u2019s treatments of the passions appear mainly\nbetween Ia75 and 2a2ae189.)\n\n\nSpinoza, though, because he denies freedom of the will, is more\nthorough than Descartes in his commitment to naturalism. This\ncommitment makes the task Spinoza undertakes in the Ethics an\neven more dramatic revision of traditional understandings of the\npassions than that which Descartes produced. So Spinoza, even more\nthan Descartes, is open to the sort of objection which traditional\nauthors, those to whom it seems beyond question that human beings are\noutside nature, might raise: how can the full range of human\npsychological phenomena be produced by natural causes? For the\nargument of the Ethics to succeed, Spinoza must produce,\nfirst, an account of how human desires and emotions might be a part of\nnature as he has presented it in the Ethics and, second, a\ndescription of those human desires and emotions which is plausibly\ncomplex, that is, plausibly consistent with our experience of\nourselves. The subsections which follow address these issues in turn.\n\n2.1 The Affects and Striving\n\n\nThe human affects, for Spinoza, are a part of nature insofar as each\ncan be redescribed in terms of striving, a property which all\nparticular things in nature share. Desire and its varieties are\nstriving itself, under a certain description. Human passions are for\nSpinoza changes, that is, increases or decreases, in the power with\nwhich we, or parts of us, strive. Active affects are all increases in\nthe power with which we strive.\n\n\nSpinoza introduces the first of his primary affects, desire, at\nIIIp9s, directly after introducing the doctrine of human striving,\nwhich, in its most general form, he calls appetite.\nIII Proposition 9, Scholium: \u2026Between appetite and\ndesire there is no difference, except that desire is generally related\nto men insofar as they are conscious of the appetite. So desire can be\ndefined as appetite together with consciousness of the\nappetite.\n\n\nThus Spinoza identifies human desire with human essence and especially\nwith consciousness of one\u2019s essence, the striving for perseverance in\nbeing. Spinoza\u2019s theory of consciousness is notoriously difficult, and\nit is not clear which ideas in a human mind are conscious or the\nextent to which things other than human beings have consciousness. For\nhuman beings, at least, however, what seems to us to cause us to act,\nour desire, does, on Spinoza\u2019s view, do just that. If I am asked for\nthe proximate cause of my action in picking up my coffee cup, for\nexample, I will respond that it was my desire for the coffee. In\nidentifying the cause of human action, striving, with conscious\ndesire, then, IIIp9s vindicates common sense to a degree. Had Spinoza\nidentified desire with something other than striving, then he would\nhave committed himself to the view that my desire does not in fact\ncause me to pick up the cup. (Desire for Spinoza, in its narrow\ndefinition at IIIp9s, is both psychological and physical, and in its\nbroader definition at III, Definitions of the Affects I, it may be\neither. This example therefore, perhaps despite appearances, need not run\nafoul of Spinoza\u2019s denial of mind-body interaction.)\n\n\nIIIp9s, then, goes a long way toward showing how the universal\nstriving doctrine can be the basis for an account of human desire. A\nserious problem remains, however. Although we tend to see desire as\nthe proximate cause of action, we tend also to conceive of desire as\ninvolving teleology or final causes. If desire causes me to pick up\nthe cup, how does it do so? The common-sense answer is\nteleological: I have, as an end, coffee, and I am, in a sense, drawn\ntoward it.  Spinoza is well-aware of the fact that we commonly\nsuppose that there are teleological causes of our actions, and some accounts of appetite in the Ethics, notably IVd7, seem to incorporate teleological notions. However, Spinoza also explicitly denies that appetite is anything other than an efficient cause.  This passage is from Part IV\u2019s Preface:\nWhat is called a final cause is nothing but a human\nappetite insofar as it is considered as a principle, or primary cause,\nof some thing. For example, when we say that habitation was the final\ncause of this or that house, surely we understand nothing but that a\nman, because he imagined the conveniences of domestic life, had an\nappetite to build a house. So habitation, insofar as it is considered\nas a final cause, is nothing more than this singular appetite. It is\nreally an efficient cause, which is considered as a first cause,\nbecause men are commonly ignorant of the causes of their\nappetites.\n\n\nSpinoza does not clearly deny, here, that there are teleological causes of\naction. (For arguments against the view that Spinoza denies all\nteleology, see Garrett 1999 and Lin 2006. Carriero 2005 is an influential argument that Spinoza does deny all teleology.)  He does, however, identify such causes\nwith efficient causes.  He needs to show, then, how the ends of human\naction relate to the processes of efficient causation.  \n\n\nFor this task, Spinoza introduces the other primary affects and a\nnumber of psychological laws associated with them. He introduces the\nprimary passions at IIIp11s.\nIII Proposition 11, Scholium: We see, then, that the mind\ncan undergo great changes, and pass now to a greater, now to a lesser\nperfection. These passions, indeed, explain to us the affects of Joy\n[laetitia] and Sadness [tristitia]. By Joy,\ntherefore, I shall understand in what follows that passion by which the\nmind passes to a greater perfection. And by Sadness, that passion by\nwhich it passes to a lesser perfection.\n\n\nThe perfectionist language Spinoza uses is important for an\nunderstanding of the basis for ethics that he finds in psychology.\nHere, however, it may be understood in terms of striving. An increased\npower to persevere in being is for Spinoza a transition to greater\nperfection and a decreased power is a transition to lesser perfection\n(see IIIp11, the end of IV Preface, and especially III, Definitions of\nthe Affects, III, Exp.). So, although this generalization is\ncomplicated by Spinoza\u2019s definitions that refer passions either to\nparts of the body or to the body as whole, joy is the passion one\nexperiences in the transition to an increased power to strive, and\nsadness is the passion one experiences in the opposite\ntransition. Spinoza thus provides, in his account of the affects, the\nbasis for an explanation of how it is that introspection into our\nconscious experience of desire might fail to bring us accurate\nknowledge of our own psychological processes. Our conscious\nexperience in forming our desires, has an emotional component: we experience\njoy and sadness and varieties of these. But we may be unaware of why\nwe feel joy or sadness or why, really, we desire what we desire. So\nSpinoza writes repeatedly, in the context of his criticisms of\nteleological reasoning and the introspective experiences of free will\nor mind/body causation (e.g., at IIIp2s): \u201cmen are conscious of their\nactions and ignorant of the causes by which they are determined.\u201d\n\n\nSpinoza characterizes the apparent teleology in desire at IIIp28:\nWe strive to promote the occurrence of whatever we imagine\nwill lead to joy, and to avert or destroy what we imagine is contrary\nto it, or will lead to sadness.\n\n\nSpinoza reserves the term \u2018imagine\u2019 [imaginor]\nfor the description of conscious states, so IIIp28 describes, at least\nin part, the objects of desire. If I imagine that coffee will lead to\njoy, then I will desire that joy and so that coffee. IIIp28, strictly\nspeaking, is not an exhaustive characterization of objects of desire.\nIt implies only that we desire anything which we imagine will lead to\njoy and are averse to whatever we imagine will lead to sadness and not\nthat we might not have other kinds of desires also, desires unrelated\nto either joy or sadness. A review of the particular forms of desire\nSpinoza catalogues in Part III (see, notably, IIIp27c3s, IIIp29s,\nIIIp40c2s,IIIp41, and IIIp56s) suggests, however, that the view is\nstill stronger than the limited claim of IIIp28: it seems that Spinoza\ndoes hold that anything I desire will be a thing which I imagine will\nlead to joy and that anything I am averse to will be something which I\nimagine will lead to sadness.\n\n\nWhat may seem on introspection, then, to be a wholly teleological\ncause of action, the end represented by an object of desire, is for\nSpinoza a peculiar manifestation in consciousness of striving, which\nin turn is an efficient cause of action. I reach for the cup of\ncoffee, I may think, just because the joy that I anticipate in the\ncoffee \u201cpulls\u201d me to it; in fact, however, I reach for the coffee\nbecause my characteristic striving (perhaps as a partial cause in\ncombination with other partial causes such as the memory of past\ncups\u2014IIIp36) has that effect. It \u201cpushes\u201d me toward the cup.\n2.2 The Variety of Affects\n\n\nPerhaps the psychological view that Spinoza introduces at IIIp28 is\nsusceptible to the sort of objection which one might raise against\npsychological hedonism, the view that human beings only desire\npleasure, the avoidance of pain, and what is instrumental to these\nthings. It may seem to some people that IIIp28 is not consistent with\ntheir own experience of their motives in acting. So, someone with a\nstrong sense of justice might say: \nIt\u2019s not that I like Jones or would get any joy from having\nhim walk. I think the guy\u2019s a jerk, and I hate to think of him out on\nthe street. But I want him to be released from prison. He simply did\nnot do what he\u2019s been convicted of, so he should be set\nfree.\n\n\nOn the basis of introspective observations like this one, one might\ncomplain that, even if Spinoza\u2019s account of the affects can be shown\nto be consistent with the general theory of striving as it is\npresented at IIIp6, still the theory of affects is not itself a\nrealistically complex account of human desire, since it cannot account\nfor desires like this one in which, on the face of it, one anticipates\nsadness in the desired end. The plausibility of Spinoza\u2019s view depends\nupon the extent to which it can reasonably redescribe this desire, and\nother similarly troubling desires, in ways which are consistent with\nIIIp28.\n\n\nSpinoza attempts to show that there are many varieties of joy, sadness,\nand desire. Thus he might attempt to address the complaint by showing\nthat its author offers a slightly inaccurate description of the\nsituation:\nThe author denies liking Jones. Let us suppose even that\nhe hates Jones. Even so, that does not mean that the author\nanticipates no joy at all in Jones\u2019s release. Knowing that his\nsociety is just in at least this one case may reassure the author\ninasmuch as it gives him reason to think that he might be fairly\ntreated himself. That is, it might be a kind of hope (IIIp18s2) which\nmotivates the desire. Or perhaps there are people the author likes,\nhis fellow citizens generally perhaps, to whom he wishes a similar\npeace of mind. The author may want the release in order to find a kind\nof joy, whether it be out of his ambition to please them or simply out\nof his human kindness (IIIp29s) or nobility (IIIp59s), in the\nwell-being of these other people.\n\n\nFar from insisting that there is one particular kind of emotion that\nmoves people, Spinoza writes that there is an innumerable variety of\naffects:\nIII Proposition 56: There are as many species of Joy,\nSadness and Desire, and consequently of each affect composed of these\n(like vacillation of mind) or derived from them (like love, hate, hope,\nfear, etc.), as there are objects by which we are\naffected.\n\n\nIIIp51 assures us, moreover, that the same object might affect\ndifferent people, or even the same person at different times, in\ndifferent ways. So Spinoza protects himself from the charge that IIIp28\nis obviously false (albeit at the risk of forwarding an unfalsifiable\npsychological claim) by arguing that, despite the seeming simplicity of\nthat proposition, it cannot be falsified by the great variety of\nconscious human motives.\n\n\nAlthough Spinoza repeatedly insists that the variety of affects is\ninnumerable, he nevertheless does characterize, in his own terms, many\nof the traditional passions, each of which is a kind of joy,\nsadness, or desire. A few of Spinoza\u2019s\nparticular accounts are notable.\n\nPity (commiseratio) is for Spinoza a species\nof sadness, sadness that arises from injury to another (IIIp22s), and\nso to feel pity, on Spinoza\u2019s view is to experience a decrease in\none\u2019s own power to persevere in being. If continued perseverance in\nbeing is what virtuous agents seek, then, Spinoza will be committed to\nthe view that pity is not a virtue. Indeed, Spinoza writes at IVp50c,\n\u201cA man who lives according to the dictates of reason, strives, as far\nas he can, not to be touched by pity.\u201d So Spinoza stands apart from\ntraditional Christian views on this subject (and also on the subjects\nof humility and repentance), and with Hobbes who conceives of pity in\nLeviathan VI as a kind of grief and so a decreasing of human\nperfection. This revisionary tendency in his thought is tempered,\nhowever, by IIIp54, where he presents pity, and also the other\ntraditional Christian virtues of humility and repentance, as, if not\ngenuine virtues themselves, at least means to virtue, by which people\nare made more able to come to learn to follow the dictates of\nreason.\n\nSelf-esteem (acquiescentia in se ipso) which\nSpinoza introduces at IIIp30 as Joy accompanied by the idea of oneself\nas an internal cause becomes an important part of Spinoza\u2019s ethical\ntheory, a species of which is even blessedness (beatitudo,\nsee IV, App. 4), the highest form of human happiness. Human beings, as\nfinite modes, cannot on Spinoza\u2019s view avoid affecting and being\naffected by external objects. Nevertheless, Spinoza\u2019s emphasis on\nself-esteem and, in his ethical theory, on self-knowledge suggests\nthat to the extent that we are able to bring about effects, including our\nown emotions, as whole or adequate causes of those effects we are more free and\nbetter off. His remarks concerning the impossibility of controlling\nthe passions and the desirability of controlling them nevertheless to\nthe extent that we can (V Preface) similarly emphasize the ethical\nimportance of self-knowledge and freedom from external influences.\n\nFear (metus) and wonder (admiratio), together with the theory of the imitation of affects, are notions that are fundamental to Spinoza\u2019s accounts of human society. Reasonable citizens (or all citizens insofar as they are reasonable) will willingly obey the rules of the state (IVp37s2, IVp73). Fear, in the Ethics, seems to be government\u2019s most valuable means of bringing passionate citizens to cooperate and obey: at IVp37s2, Spinoza suggests that states should rely on threats. In the Theological Political Treatise, however, Spinoza\u2019s accounts of religion, and particularly of miracles and scripture, suggest that devotion devotio, a passion associated with wonder at Ethics IIIp52s, is a better political motive than fear. In Chapter 5, for example, Spinoza writes of Moses\u2019s introduction of religion into the Hebrew state:\nTwo things in particular forced this on him: the stubborn mentality of the people (because it would not allow itself to be compelled solely by force) and the threat of war. For if war is to go well, it is better to encourage the soldiers than to frighten them with penalties and threats. In this way they will be eager to distinguish themselves for excellence and nobility of spirit rather than merely to avoid punishment.\n\n\nThe theory of the imitation of affects informs these and other accounts of social dynamics in Spinoza. Human beings tend, he argues, to imitate the affects of those that we take to be similar to ourselves (IIIp27), and we tend, when we feel a given affect toward a person whom we take to differ from us, to feel that same affect toward that person\u2019s whole class or nation (IIIp46). Spinoza grounds these doctrines on a series of claims about our associative tendencies at Ethics IIIpp14\u201324. \n\n\nFinally, active joy and active desire\nwhich Spinoza introduces at IIIp58 represent a separate class of\naffects notable both for their novelty against the background of\ntraditional accounts of the passions and also for their importance to\nSpinoza\u2019s ethical arguments of Parts IV and V. On traditional accounts\nof the passions, even Descartes\u2019s (The Passions of the Soul,\nI.1), actions and passions are the same thing, regarded from different\nperspectives: when A does X to B, X is an action for A but a passion\nfor B. For Spinoza, however, anything which follows in a person where\nthat person is an \u201cinadequate\u201d or partial cause of the thing, is a\npassion, and anything that follows where a person is an \u201cadequate\u201d or\ntotal cause of the thing is an action. Thus Spinoza\u2019s class of active\naffects places a strong emphasis on people\u2019s roles as total causes of\nwhat they do; because it becomes for Spinoza ethically important that a\nperson be active rather than passive, that emphasis raises a host of\nquestions about the extent to which a person, a particular thing\ninteracting constantly with other things and indeed requiring some of\nthem for sustenance, can come to resist passion and guide himself by\nmeans of joy and the active desires. \n\n\nBecause joy and sadness as introduced at IIIp11s are passions, all\nof the desires arising from them or species of them are passive as\nwell, that is, they are not desires which arise from a person\u2019s\nstriving alone but only as a partial cause in combination with other,\nultimately external causes. Active joy, which must include at least\nsome types of warranted self-esteem, and active desires, among which\nSpinoza lists at IIIp59s tenacity (animositas) and nobility\n(generositas), are wholly active however; that is, they are\nemotions and desires that people have only insofar as they are adequate\ncauses, or genuine actors. (Notice that sadness cannot ever be an\nactive emotion. People cannot, insofar as they are active bring it\nabout that their power of acting is decreased, so passive sadness,\nunlike passive joy and desire, has no active counterpart.)\n\n\nOf these active affects, the most important for an interpretation of\nSpinoza\u2019s ethics and political philosophy is likely\nnobility. Spinoza\u2019s predominant egoism, together with some of his\nstill stronger statements of psychological egoism such as that at I\nAppendix, suggest that individuals are not, or are not often,\naltruistic. Moreover, his ethics, with its emphasis on self-esteem and\nself-knowledge appears in ways to be an individualistic one: the good,\nwhen I attain it, is a perfection of myself, not of society or the\nworld. However, Spinoza does offer an argument (IVp37) for the view\nthat any good that I want for myself I will have reason to want for\nothers as well, and, in the Ethics, this argument forms the\nbasis of morality and the state (IVp37s1 and s2, respectively). This\nis also a theme of the opening sections of the Treatise on the\nEmendation of the Intellect (see, especially, Spinoza (1), II/8\n23-II/9 3). Nobility is the active affect most closely related to\nSpinoza\u2019s views about morality and the state.  As Spinoza defines it,\nit is a wholly active desire to join others in friendship and to aid\nthem. It helps to supply, in Spinoza theory of the affects, a basis\nfor the view that aiding others is virtuous and rational.\n\nFurther reading: Recent interpretations of\nSpinoza\u2019s theory of consciousness include Miller 2007, Garrett 2008,\nNadler 2008, LeBuffe 2010c, and Marshall 2014.

The Psychological Basis for a Theory of Value\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s insistence that human beings not be treated as a dominion\nwithin a dominion includes a commitment to ethical naturalism also.\nJust as he insists that the human mind must be explicable in terms of\nthe laws which govern nature, so he insists that ethical properties,\nwhich he sometimes characterizes as human \u201cmodes of thinking,\u201d be\nexplicable in terms of natural ones. The theory of the affects serves\nSpinoza\u2019s ethical naturalism by introducing explanations of ethical\nconcepts, most importantly the concepts of good, evil, and perfection,\nin psychological terms. In his ethics, Spinoza in some way \u201cretains\nthese words,\u201d although he may be understood to do so under some formal\nrefinement or revision of them (See IV Preface). So his discussions of\ngood and evil and of human perfection in Part III provide the basis for\nthe formal ethical argument which follows in Parts IV and V. \n3.1 Good and Evil as Modes of Thinking\n\n\nBefore defining \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019 formally,\nSpinoza at IV Preface regards good and evil as labels, \u201cmodes of\nthinking,\u201d that human beings apply to things but which really reveal\nlittle about the things to which they are applied: \nAs far as good and evil are concerned, they also indicate\nnothing positive in things, considered in themselves, nor are they\nanything other than modes of thinking, or notions we form because we\ncompare things to one another. For one and the same thing can be good,\nand [evil], and also indifferent. For example, Music is good for one\nwho is melancholy, [evil to] one who is mourning, and neither good nor\n[evil] to one who is deaf.\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cnothing positive in things\u201d means perhaps that an\nobserver of people would find that \u2018good\u2019 and\n\u2018evil\u2019, as people use them are two place predicates rather\nthan one place predicates. If Martha calls music evil, then, what that\nindicates to one who knows about the human use of these terms is that\nthe music is evil to Martha. Moreover, since the same music can be good\nor evil for different people, or for people in different states, the\ntwo-place predication reveals more about Martha than about the music.\nIt must be some fact about the person, rather than some fact about the\nthing called good or evil, that is of central importance to the\nunderstanding of the label.\n\n\nIIIp9s suggests that the fact about the person which the label\nreveals is her conative state:\nIt is clear that we neither strive for, nor will, neither\nwant, nor desire anything because we judge it to be good; on the\ncontrary, we judge something to be good because we strive for it, will\nit, want it, and desire it.\n\n\nSpinoza finds that the designation of a thing as good follows from a\nperson\u2019s conative state: Martha is averse to music and therefore she\ncalls it evil. Should the music become good to another person, or\nperhaps Martha herself in different circumstances, it would not be\nbecause the music has changed, but because the person\u2019s conative state\nis different: she desires the music. (This analysis of the good is\nsimilar to Hobbes\u2019s at Leviathan VI. Maimonides, another of\nSpinoza\u2019s influences, also has a similar analysis:\nGuide of the Perplexed, III, 13.)\n\nIIIp39s builds upon IIIp9s. There Spinoza writes that, \u201ceach\none, from his own affect, judges, or evaluates, what is good and what\nis [evil]\u2026So the greedy man judges an abundance of money best,\nand poverty worst. The ambitious man desires nothing so much as esteem\nand dreads nothing so much as shame.\u201d However, IIIp39s also uses\nSpinoza\u2019s theory of the affects to introduce new definitions of\ngood and evil:\nBy good here I understand every kind of joy, and whatever\nleads to it, and especially whatever satisfies any kind of longing,\nwhatever that may be. And by evil, every kind of sadness and especially\nwhat frustrates longing.\n\n\nIIIp28, the proposition establishing Spinoza\u2019s doctrine that human\nbeings desire whatever will bring joy and are averse to whatever will\nlead to sadness, allows Spinoza to connect the objects of any human\ndesire with joy or the avoidance of sadness. So, if it is true that we\ncall a thing good only if we desire it, then it will also be true that\nanything we call good will be joy or what leads to it. Understood in\nthis way, IIIp39s simply restates the doctrine of IIIp9s in light of\nIIIp28.\n\n\nHowever, Spinoza might be extending rather than merely restating his\nposition at IIIp39s. Every kind of joy we experience is not presumably\na result of conscious desire, and Spinoza allows at IIIP39s that these\ninstances of joy (i.e., those which do not satisfy any kind of\nlonging) are also good. On this view, not only is whatever Martha desires good\nfor her, but, in addition, anything which she does not desire but\nwhich nonetheless might bring her joy will also be good. Perhaps, for example, Martha will take delight in a view that she never anticipated, a serendipitous good. IIIp39s, so understood, identifies the good and evil for a person with broader\nclasses of things, and makes possible an analysis of good and evil in\nterms of something other than an individual person\u2019s current\ndesires. Because, in giving an account of the right way of living in\nParts IV and V, Spinoza presumably urges people to desire and do\nthings in a way different from what they desire and do already, this\nbroadening of the application of the terms \u2018good\u2019 and\n\u2018evil\u2019 (to apply to things other than what people\npresently desire or are averse to) contributes to the plausibility of\nhis ethical naturalism.\n3.2 The Psychological Basis for Perfectionism\n\n\nThe meaning of \u2018perfection\u2019 (perfectio) in\nvarious passages of the Ethics is obscured by the fact that\nSpinoza uses the term both in what he takes to be its common meaning\nand also in a narrow, formal sense. In some passages, such as IV\nPreface, Spinoza treats perfection, like good and evil, to be a label\nthat people apply to things, to be explained in terms of those\npeople\u2019s use of the label: people call a thing perfect which conforms\nto the model of the thing that they create for themselves. In other\npassages, however, Spinoza treats perfection as whatever is \u201cpositive\u201d\nor \u201creal\u201d in a thing, a genuine property, and this concept forms part\nof his formal apparatus (IId6).\n\n\nBoth senses of the term occur in Spinoza\u2019s analysis of human\nperfection. At IV Preface Spinoza invokes a concept of perfection\nbased upon a model of human nature that we set before ourselves. And\nSpinoza describes perfection of the human mind in terms of its power\nof thinking, as we have already seen, at IIIp11 and its scholium: the\nmind\u2019s power of thinking is its perfection; joy is an increase in that\npower or a passage to a greater perfection; and sadness is a decrease\nin that power or a passage to a lesser perfection.\n\n\nThus Spinoza has two different accounts of human perfection which\nmight contribute to the perfectionist language of the ethical argument\nthat he develops in various ways in Parts IV and V. Although the first\naccount contributes to both Spinoza\u2019s formal definitions of good and\nevil and also, probably, to the \u201cfree man\u201d propositions of Part IV, it\nis perhaps the second account which is of greater importance. It,\nafter all, resonates with Spinoza\u2019s account of the good at IIIp39s,\nand so comes to form part of a consistent moral view: if the good is\nany form of joy (IIIp39s) and joy is the passage to a greater\nperfection (IIIp11s), then the good is whatever makes us more\nperfect. On the other hand, the first account might imply a different\nset of norms from IIIp39s: it seems that we may have different models\nof human nature that we set before ourselves, and that they may or may\nnot include the various things that give us joy. Perhaps the formal\naccount of perfection at IId6 and later at IIIp11 give Spinoza a means\nof reformulating the idea of perfection as a model of human nature in\na way which reconciles the two senses of the term: the ideal we set\nbefore ourselves will be a person who possesses the greatest possible\npower of action. This would be, in effect, to correlate our\nsystematically distorted ways of perceiving ourselves\u2014as free\nagents pursuing as an end a model of human nature\u2014with the\ncauses that really determine our actions.\nOf course, the question of what an outside observer may infer from\nanother person\u2019s use of moral language, for example that what a person\nfinds good is something in which she anticipates pleasure or that\nmakes her more powerful, is different from the questions of what a\nperson using moral language takes that language to mean or what\nSpinoza takes moral language to mean. The analyses discussed here\ninvite reductionist interpretations, on which, for example\n\u201cgood\u201d just means pleasant, but the thesis that people\nconsistently find pleasant things good is perfectly consistent with\nany number of different theses about what they mean by that\ndesignation and about what it really means to be good. Reconciling\nSpinoza\u2019s psychological theses about moral language use in Part III of\nthe Ethics with what appear to straightforward, richer and\nnon-reductive theses about morality in Parts IV and V is one of the\nbiggest challenges facing interpreters of Spinoza.\n\nFurther Reading: Curley 1988, Delahunty\n1985, Garrett 1996, Yovel 1999, LeBuffe 2010a, Chapters 8 and 9, and\nKisner 2010 offer accounts of Spinoza\u2019s ethical language as it relates\nto his psychology.
