    "main_text": "Probabilistic Causal Models || Identifiability with Assumptions about Functional Form\n4.5 Identifiability with Assumptions about Functional Form\n\nSuppose we have a SEM with endogenous variables \\(\\bV\\) and exogenous\nvariables \\(\\bU\\), where each variable in \\(\\bV\\) is determined by an\nequation of the form: \n\n\\[X_i = f_i (\\bPA(X_i), U_i).\\]\n\n\nSuppose, moreover, that we have a probability distribution \\(\\Pr'\\) on\n\\(\\bU\\) in which all of the \\(U_i\\)s are independent. This will induce\na probability distribution P on \\(\\bV\\) that satisfies MC relative to\nthe correct causal DAG on \\(\\bV\\). In other words, our probabilistic\nSEM will generate a unique causal Bayes net. The methods described in\nthe previous section attempt to infer the underlying graph \\(\\bG\\)\nfrom relations of probabilistic dependence and independence. These\nmethods can do no better than identifying the Markov equivalence\nclass. Can we do better by making use of additional information about\nthe probability distribution P, beyond relations of dependence and\nindependence?\n\nThere is good news and there is bad news. First the bad news. If the\nvariables in \\(\\bV\\) are discrete, and we make no assumptions about\nthe form of the functions \\(f_i\\), then we can infer no more about the\nSEM than the Markov equivalence to which the graph belongs (Meek\n1995).\n\nMore bad news: If the variables in \\(\\bV\\) are continuous, the\nsimplest assumption, and the one that has been studied in most detail,\nis that the equations are linear with Gaussian\n(normal, or bell-shaped) errors. That is:\n\n\\(X_i = \\sum_j c_j X_j + U_i\\), where j ranges over the\nindices of \\(\\bPA(X_i)\\) and the \\(c_j\\)s are constants\n\\(Pr'\\) assigns a Gaussian distribution to each \\(U_i\\)\n\n\nIt turns out that with these assumptions, we can do no better than\ninferring the Markov equivalence class of the causal graph on \\(\\bV\\)\nfrom probabilistic dependence and independence (Geiger & Pearl\n1988).\n\nNow for the good news. There are fairly general assumptions that allow\nus to infer a good deal more. Here are some fairly simple cases:\n\n\n(LiNGaM) (Shimizu et al. 2006)\nIf:\n\nThe variables in \\(\\bV\\) are continuous;\nThe functions \\(f_i\\) are linear;\nThe probability distributions on the error variables \\(U_i\\) are\nnot Gaussian (or at most one is Gaussian);\nThe error variables \\(U_i\\) are probabilistically independent in\n\\(\\Pr'\\);\n\n\nthen the correct DAG on \\(\\bV\\) can be uniquely determined by the\ninduced probability distribution P on \\(\\bV\\).\n\n(Non-linear additive) (Hoyer et al. 2009)\nAlmost all functions of the following form allow the correct DAG on\n\\(\\bV\\) to be uniquely determined by the induced probability\ndistribution P on \\(\\bV\\).:\n\nThe functions \\(f_i\\) are nonlinear and the errors are additive\n(so \\(X_i = f_i (\\bPA(X_i)) + U_i\\), with \\(f_i\\) nonlinear);\nThe error variables \\(U_i\\) are probabilistically independent in\n\\(\\Pr'\\);\n\n\n\nIn fact, this case can be generalized considerably:\n\n(Post non-linear) (Zhang & Hyv\u00e4rinen\n2009)\nWith the exception of five specific cases that can be fully specified,\nall functions of the following form allow the correct DAG on \\(\\bV\\)\nto be uniquely determined by the induced probability distribution P on\n\\(\\bV\\).:\n\n\nThe functions have the form \\(X_i = g_i (f_i (\\bPA(X_i)) + U_i)\\)\nwith \\(f_i\\) and \\(g_i\\) nonlinear, and \\(g_i\\) invertible;\nThe error variables \\(U_i\\) are probabilistically independent in\n\\(\\Pr'\\);\n\n\n\nSee also Peters et al. (2017) for discussion.\n\nWhile there are specific assumptions behind these results, they are\nnonetheless remarkable. They entail, for example, that (given the\nassumptions of the theorems) knowing only the probability distribution\non two variables X and Y, we can infer whether X\ncauses Y or Y causes X.\n",
