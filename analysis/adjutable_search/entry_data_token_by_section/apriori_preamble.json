    "main_text": "\n\nA priori justification is a type of epistemic justification\nthat is, in some sense, independent of experience. Gettier examples\nhave led most philosophers to think that having a justified true\nbelief is not sufficient for knowledge\n (see Section 4.4, below,\n and the examples there), but many still believe that it is necessary.\nIn this entry, it will be assumed, for the most part, that even though\njustification is not sufficient for knowledge it is necessary and that\na priori knowledge is knowledge based on a priori\njustification. So much of the discussion will focus on a\npriori justification.\n\nThere are a variety of views about whether a priori\njustification requires some sort of evidence or whether, instead, some\npropositions can be \u201cdefault reasonable\u201d, or that a person\ncan be entitled to accept certain propositions independent of any\nevidence, perhaps because they are reasonable presuppositions of some\narea of inquiry. Philosophers who think that a priori\njustification requires evidence differ about the details. Some think\nthat a priori evidence can be defeated (overridden or\nundercut) by other evidence, including evidence from sensory\nobservations. There are a variety of views about whether a\npriori justification, and knowledge, must be only of propositions\nabout what is possible or necessary, and if necessary, only of\nanalytic propositions, that is, propositions that are in some sense\n\u201ctrue in virtue of their meaning\u201d (as in examples\n 1a\u20138a,\n below). Those who think that a priori justification requires\nevidence often think that the evidence is provided by rational\nintuitions or insights, but there is disagreement about the nature of\nthose intuitions or insights, and critics deny that they really do\nconstitute evidence.\n\nThe following list indicates the topics that will be presented and\naddressed.\n",
