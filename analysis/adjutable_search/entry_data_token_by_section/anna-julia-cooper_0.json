Situating Cooper: Context for Cooper\u2019s Two Best-Known Writings\n\n\nAnna Julia Cooper\u2019s best-known written work, A Voice from the\nSouth by a Black Woman of the South, was published in 1892. This collection of essays and\nspeeches, described by Mary Helen Washington as an \u201cunparalleled\narticulation of black feminist thought\u201d and by Beverley\nGuy-Sheftall as the first book length Black feminist text, emphasizes\nthe import of a woman\u2019s voice and her unique contributions while at\nthe same time highlighting the racialization of gender and the\nsexualization of race. Cooper takes an intersectional approach to\nexamining the interlocking systems of race, gender, and class\noppression\u2014explicitly articulating how Black women are\nsimultaneously impacted by racism (the race problem) and sexism (the\nwoman question) and yet she is either an unknown or unacknowledged (by\nwhite women, white men, or Black men) factor in examining or\neliminating these systems of oppression. For these reasons, Cooper\nargues, Black women have a unique epistemological standpoint from\nwhich to observe society and its oppressive systems as well as a\nunique ethical contribution to make in confronting and correcting\nthese oppressive systems. Other central themes in Voice include the importance of education and intellectual\ndevelopment; the necessity of respecting difference and the special\ncontribution that each racial group makes for human progress; an\neconomic, materialist, and existential conceptualization of value or\nworth; and a theory of truth. Thus, this seminal text has\nphilosophical import not only for feminist philosophy, standpoint\ntheory, and epistemology, but also for Critical Philosophy of Race and\nAfrican American philosophy.\n\n\nAnna Julia Cooper\u2019s Voice was published less than 30\nyears after the 1865 13th Amendment to the Constitution\nwhich declared: \u201cNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a\npunishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,\nshall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their\njurisdiction.\u201d Select major works that come before Cooper\u2019s Voice include Memoirs of Elleanor Eldridge (1838); Religious Experience and the Journal of Mrs. Jarena Lee, Giving an Account of Her Call to Preach the Gospel (1849);  Narrative of SojournerTruth (1850) and the \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d remarks\nattributed to Sojourner Truth (from the 1851 Women\u2019s convention\n in Akron, OH[2]); Narrative of\nthe Life of Frederick Douglass (1845) and Douglass\u2019s My\nBondage and My Freedom (1855); and Martin Delany\u2019s \nThe Origins of Races and Color (1879).\n\n\nSignificantly, Cooper\u2019s Voice is published\nbefore Booker T. Washington\u2019s famous \u201cAtlanta\nAddress\u201d (1895), his autobiographical works The Story of My\nLife and Work (1896) and Up From Slavery (1901), as well\nas Washington\u2019s historic two-volume The Story of the\nNegro (1909). It is also published ahead of W.E.B. Du\nBois\u2019s well-known \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d (1897)\nspeech, the publication of The Souls of Black Folk (composed\nof essays and speeches written by Du Bois between 1897 and 1903), and\nDarkwater: Voices from Within the Veil (1920) which not only\nborrows the language of Cooper\u2019s book title, but also relies on\nCooper\u2019s astute insights on race and gender. As Mary Helen\nWashington and Joy James have noted, Du Bois quoted a passage from\nCooper\u2019s \u201cWomanhood: A Vital Element in the Regeneration\nand Progress of a Race,\u201d in his essay \u201cThe Damnation of\nWomen\u201d from Darkwater, however; he truncates\nCooper\u2019s full argument in his selective quotations and he fails\nto acknowledge her as the source of the quote.\n\n\nCooper\u2019s scholarly contributions beyond A Voice from the\nSouth include her translation of the classic French text Le\nP\u00e8lerinage de Charlemagne in 1917 and, of course, her\ndissertation\u2014L\u2019attitude de la France \u00e0\nl\u2019\u00e9gard l\u2019esclavage pendant la revolution\n(later translated by Frances Richardson Keller Slavery and the\nFrench Revolutionists) which she defended in Paris, France at the\n Sorbonne in\n 1925.[3]\n Cooper\nbecame the fourth African American woman in the US to earn a Ph.D. and\naccomplishes this feat the same year as Alain Locke publishes two\nseminal writings. Locke, having earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from\nHarvard University in 1918, on the topic \u201cThe Problem of\nClassification in Theory of Value\u201d goes on to publish\n\u201cHarlem: Mecca of the New Negro\u201d and then the book length\n version The New Negro: An Interpretation in\n 1925.[4] \n There are several newspaper\narticles announcing Cooper\u2019s achievement, but the event itself,\nand perhaps more importantly the scholarly contributions made by Cooper\nin her thesis, seems to slip into oblivion. Cooper\u2019s\nproject examines the ways in which attitudes about race and the\ninstitution of slavery in France and San Dominique impacted\nconceptualizations of rights and freedom in the contexts of the French\nand Haitian Revolutions (and the Age of Reason and Revolution more\ngenerally). This work by Cooper is quite significant insofar as\nthe Haitian Revolution is too often overlooked in relation to the\nAmerican and French Revolutions, and furthermore, there was a United\nStates military occupation of Haiti at the time she wrote it\n(1914\u20131935). Cooper\u2019s dissertation offers an insightful and\nyet underappreciated analysis of the Haitian Revolution that could be\npaired well with, for example, C.L.R. James\u2019s The Black\nJacobins.\n\n\nIn addition to these better-known major scholarly writings, Cooper\nwent on to write and publish other essays and critical commentaries\nover several decades\u2014including a memoir about earning her doctorate\nfrom the Sorbonne titled The Third Step and a memoir about the\nGrimk\u00e9 family titled The Early Years in Washington:\nReminiscences of Life with the Grimk\u00e9s (both memoirs\npublished about the middle of the twentieth century). \nIntentionally placing Cooper\u2019s scholarship and activism front and\ncenter in recognizing her philosophical import goes against\ncommentaries that cast aside Cooper\u2019s theoretical contributions\nto focus almost exclusively on her biography and personal life. \nAs Lewis Gordon has noted in Existentia Africana: Understanding\nAfricana Existential Thought (2000), too often we find a close\nexamination of the ideas and theories of Black intellectuals absent\nbecause interpretations of their biographies and experiences have been\npreferred focal points. Vivian M. May takes this a step further\nin Anna Julia Cooper, Visionary Black Feminist: A Critical\nIntroduction (2007) where she notes a disturbing tendency among\nmany writers to focus on Black women intellectuals\u2019 lives rather\nthan their theories. Consequently, Black women\u2019s arguments\nand theoretical contributions have frequently been under-engaged or\neven dismissed altogether because so much attention is concentrated on\ntheir life stories. Indeed, the bulk of this encyclopedia entry\nfocuses on Cooper\u2019s scholarship, activism, and philosophical\ncontributions in order to resist this troubling trend. A brief\nbiographical and historical background is available at the end of this\nentry to locate Cooper\u2019s theoretical work within a larger\nsocio-historical and biographical context.\n",
