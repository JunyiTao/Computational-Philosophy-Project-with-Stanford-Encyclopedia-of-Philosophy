    "main_text": "Ontology: What Are Models? || Fictional objects and abstract objects\n2.2 Fictional objects and abstract objects\n\nWhat has become known as the fiction view of models sees\nmodels as akin to the imagined objects of literary fiction\u2014that\nis, as akin to fictional characters like Sherlock Holmes or fictional\nplaces like Middle Earth (Godfrey-Smith 2007). So when Bohr introduced\nhis model of the atom he introduced a fictional object of the same\nkind as the object Conan Doyle introduced when he invented Sherlock\nHolmes. This view squares well with scientific practice, where\nscientists often talk about models as if they were objects and often\ntake themselves to be describing imaginary atoms, populations,\nor economies. It also squares well with philosophical views that see\nthe construction and manipulation of models as essential aspects of\nscientific investigation (Morgan 1999), even if models are not\nmaterial objects, because these practices seem to be directed toward\nsome kind of object.\n\nWhat philosophical questions does this move solve? Fictional discourse\nand fictional entities face well-known philosophical questions, and\none may well argue that simply likening models to fictions amounts to\nexplaining obscurum per obscurius (for a discussion of these\nquestions, see the entry on\n fictional entities).\n One way to counter this objection and to motivate the fiction view of\nmodels is to point to the view\u2019s heuristic power. In this vein\nFrigg (2010b) identifies five specific issues that an ontology of\nmodels has to address and then notes that these issues arise in very\nsimilar ways in the discussion about fiction (the issues are the\nidentity conditions, property attribution, the semantics of\ncomparative statements, truth conditions, and the epistemology of\nimagined objects). Likening models to fiction then has heuristic value\nbecause there is a rich literature on fiction that offers a number of\nsolutions to these issues.\n\nOnly a small portion of the options available in the extensive\nliterature on fictions have actually been explored in the context of\nscientific models. Contessa (2010) formulates what he calls the\n\u201cdualist account\u201d, according to which a model is an\nabstract object that stands for a possible concrete object. The\nRutherford model of the atom, for instance, is an abstract object that\nacts as a stand-in for one of the possible systems that contain an\nelectron orbiting around a nucleus in a well-defined orbit.\nBarberousse and Ludwig (2009) and Frigg (2010b) take a different route\nand develop an account of models as fictions based on Walton\u2019s\n(1990) pretense theory of fiction. According to this view the\nsentences of a passage of text introducing a model should be seen as a\nprop in a game of make-believe, and the model is the product of an act\nof pretense. This is an antirealist position in that it takes talk of\nmodel \u201cobjects\u201d to be figures of speech because ultimately\nthere are no model objects\u2014models only live in scientists\u2019\nimaginations. Salis (forthcoming) reformulates this view to become\nwhat she calls the \u201cthe new fiction view of models\u201d. The\ncore difference lies in the fact that what is considered as the model\nare the model descriptions and their content rather than the\nimaginings that they prescribe. This is a realist view of models,\nbecause descriptions exist.\n\nThe fiction view is not without critics. Giere (2009), Magnani (2012),\nPincock (2012), Portides (2014), and Teller (2009) reject the fiction\napproach and argue, in different ways, that models should not be\nregarded as fictions. Weisberg (2013) argues for a middle position\nwhich sees fictions as playing a heuristic role but denies that they\nshould be regarded as forming part of a scientific model. The common\ncore of these criticisms is that the fiction view misconstrues the\nepistemic standing of models. To call something a fiction, so the\ncharge goes, is tantamount to saying that it is false, and it is\nunjustified to call an entire model a fiction\u2014and thereby claim\nthat it fails to capture how the world is\u2014just because the model\ninvolves certain false assumptions or fictional elements. In other\nwords, a representation isn\u2019t automatically counted as fiction\njust because it has some inaccuracies. Proponents of the fiction view\nagree with this point but deny that the notion of fiction should be\nanalyzed in terms of falsity. What makes a work a fiction is not its\nfalsity (or some ratio of false to true claims): neither is everything\nthat is said in a novel untrue (Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace\ncontains many true statements about Napoleon\u2019s Franco-Russian\nWar), nor does every text containing false claims qualify as fiction\n(false news reports are just that, they are not fictions). The\ndefining feature of a fiction is that readers are supposed to\nimagine the events and characters described, not that they\nare false (Frigg 2010a; Salis forthcoming).\n\nGiere (1988) advocated the view that \u201cnon-physical\u201d models\nare abstract entities. However, there is little agreement on the\nnature of abstract objects, and Hale (1988: 86\u201387) lists no less\nthan twelve different possible characterizations (for a review of the\navailable options, see the entry on\n abstract objects).\n In recent publications, Thomasson (2020) and Thomson-Jones\n(2020) develop what they call an \u201cartifactualist\nview\u201d of models, which is based on Thomasson\u2019s (1999)\ntheory of abstract artifacts. This view agrees with the pretense\ntheory that the content of text that introduces a fictional character\nor a model should be understood as occurring in pretense, but at the\nsame time insists that in producing such descriptions authors create\nabstract cultural artifacts that then exist independently of either\nthe author or the readers. Artifactualism agrees with Platonism that\nabstract objects exist, but insists, contra Platonism, that\nabstract objects are brought into existence through a creative act and\nare not eternal.  This allows the artifactualist to preserve the\nadvantages of pretense theory while at the same time holding the\nrealist view that fictional characters and models actually exist.\n",
