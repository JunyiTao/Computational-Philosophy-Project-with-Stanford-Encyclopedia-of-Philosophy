    "main_text": "Heidegger for Art, Introduction:  The Three Pillars of Heidegger\u2019s Understanding of Art || From the Phenomenology of Van Gogh\u2019s Painting to the Ontology of Art\n3.5 From the Phenomenology of Van Gogh\u2019s Painting to the Ontology of Art\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s most famous presentation of Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting pivots again on an ambiguous use of \u201cnothing,\u201d to\nwhich Heidegger now adds an elliptical, intimating locution (\u201cAnd\nyet\u2026\u201d) in order to encourage his audience to hear a subtle\nshift and so notice the meaning suggested by his otherwise superfluous\naddition, \u201cand nothing more.\u201d Heidegger\u2019s use\nof this ambiguous locution (\u201cand nothing more\u201d) was a\nwell-established rhetorical trope for him by 1935; it was his preferred\nmethod for introducing the idea of that \u201cnothing\u201d we\nencounter when we move beyond the totality of entities toward that\nwhich makes it possible to encounter these entities the way we\ndo. Heidegger had established the pattern in 1929\u2019s\n\u201cWhat Is Metaphysics?\u201d by deliberately employing just such\nambiguous locutions seven times in a row, referring to \u201cthe\nentity itself\u2014and nothing besides [und sonst\nnichts],\u201d \u201cthe entity itself\u2014and nothing further\n[und weiter nichts],\u201d \u201cthe entity itself\u2014and\nbeyond that, nothing,\u201d etc., and then driving the point home with\nthe rhetorical question: \u201cIs this only a manner of\nspeaking\u2014and nothing besides?\u201d (P 84/GA9 105)\n\n\nSeen in this light, the fact that Heidegger repeats the same\nrhetorical strategy when he introduces Van Gogh\u2019s painting\nbecomes unmistakable:\n\n\n A pair of farmer\u2019s shoes and nothing more. And yet.\n[Ein Paar Bauernschuhe und nichts weiter. Und dennoch.]\n\n\nFrom out of the dark opening of the worn insides of the shoes the\ntoilsome tread of the worker stares forth\u2026 The shoes\nvibrate with the silent call of the earth, its quiet gift of the\nripening grain [i.e., \u201cearth\u201d makes \u201cworld\u201d\npossible by inconspicuously giving itself to the world] and\nthe earth\u2019s unexplained self-refusal in the fallow desolation of\nthe wintry field [i.e., it is also constitutive of earth that it\nresists this world by receding back into itself]. (PLT\n33\u20134/GA5 19)\n\n\n\nAs the editorial insertions suggest, the point of Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenological interpretation of Van Gogh\u2019s painting of the\nshoes is not to engage in an armchair anthropology of farming but,\nrather, to suggest that attending to the \u201cnothing\u201d in Van\nGogh\u2019s painting reveals the deepest level of \u201ctruth\u201d\nat work in art, namely, the essential tension in which the\nphenomenologically abundant \u201cearth\u201d simultaneously makes\npossible and also resists being finally mastered or fully expressed\nwithin the \u201cworld.\u201d\n\n\nWhen attending to the mysterious nothing allows us to recognize the\ndynamic tension between \u201cearth\u201d and \u201cworld\u201d\npreserved in Van Gogh\u2019s painting, then we have thereby\nencountered what is for Heidegger the inner tension at the heart of\nart, a tension which not only drives art and keeps it alive but also\nallows humanity\u2019s understanding of being to unfold\nhistorically. \u201cArt\u201d in this essential\nsense\u2014which Heidegger also calls \u201cpoetry\u201d or\npoiesis, that is, bringing into being\u2014can be\nunderstood as an unending creative struggle to express that which\nconditions and informs our worlds of meaning and yet resists being\nexhaustively articulated in the terms of these\n worlds.[64]\nThe conflict preserved\nin Van Gogh\u2019s painting\u2014between emerging into the light and\nreceding into the darkness, revealing and withdrawing, \u201cemerging\nand not emerging\u201d\u2014is thus for Heidegger the basic structure\nof intelligibility as it takes place in time.\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s description of this essential conflict between\nearth and world should be understood as his attempt to elaborate\nphenomenologically his enduring ontological understanding of truth as\nthe inherently agonistic manifestation of a-l\u00eatheia,\nthat is, \u201ctruth\u201d conceived ontologically as\nhistorically-variable \u201cun-concealment\u201d or\n\u201cdis-closure.\u201d It is, we could say, the\nhyphen in a-l\u00eatheia\u2014the joining together,\nliterally \u201cunder one\u201d (hypo + hen), of\nrevealing and concealing\u2014that Heidegger develops as the essential\nstrife between world and\n earth.[65]\nWith world and earth, in other words,\nHeidegger seeks to name and so render visible the quietly conflictual\nstructure at the heart of intelligibility, the unified opposition that\nallows \u201cbeing\u201d to be \u201cdis-closed\u201d in\ntime. Since Being and Time at least, Heidegger had\ninsisted on the \u201cequiprimordiality\u201d or\n\u201cco-originality\u201d (Gleichurspr\u00fcnglichkeit) of\n\u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cuntruth\u201d (BT 265/SZ 222), building\non Husserl\u2019s phenomenological axiom that the emergence of one\nthing or aspect of a thing into intelligibility requires the concealing\nof another. (Taken to its extreme, this axiom allows Heidegger to\nsuggest that the totality of what-is stands in the place of and so\nconceals the \u201cnothing\u201d from which it\n emerges.)[66]\nFor\nHeidegger, the fact that there can be no revealing without concealing\n(and vice versa) is a necessary feature not just of perception or\ncognition but of intelligibility in\n general.[67]\n\n\n\nThe truth disclosed by Van Gogh\u2019s particular\n(\u201contic\u201d) work of art is thus ontological.\nThat is, the tension between emerging and withdrawing that is visible\nin Van Gogh\u2019s painting implicitly conditions all artistic\ncreation, which (we have seen) means all bringing-into-being, that is,\nall historical intelligibility. Heidegger thus goes so far as to\nclaim that:\n\n\nThe world is the self-disclosing openness of the broad paths of the\nsimple and essential decisions in the destiny of an historical\npeople. The earth is the spontaneous forthcoming of that which is\ncontinually self-secluding and to that extent sheltering and\nconcealing. World and earth are essentially different from one\nanother and yet are never separated\u2026 The work-being of the\nwork consists in the fighting of the battle [der Bestreitung des\nStreites] between world and earth. (PLT 49/GA5 35\u20136)\n\n\nAs \u201cearth,\u201d in other words, intelligibility\ntantalizingly offers previously unglimpsed aspects of itself to our\nunderstanding and yet also withdraws from our attempts to order those\naspects into a single fixed meaning. As \u201cworld,\u201d we\nstruggle nevertheless to force a stable ordering onto this\ninexhaustible phenomenological abundance, however temporarily. In\nthis way, \u201cearth\u201d both supports and resists\n\u201cworld,\u201d tantalizingly eliciting, always informing,\nand yet also partly escaping all our attempts to finally stabilize our\nintelligible worlds, to assign a firm shape to things once and for\nall.\n\n\nThe \u201cessential strife\u201d of this a-l\u00eatheiac\nstruggle between concealing and revealing, earth and world, is\nprecisely what Heidegger thinks Van Gogh renders visible in his\npainting of \u201cA Pair of\n Shoes.\u201d[68]\nWhat we can thus learn\nfrom a work of art like Van Gogh\u2019s painting\u2014in which this\nusually inconspicuous tension is masterfully preserved and\nconveyed\u2014is that our intelligible worlds are shaped by what we\ntake from and make of a dynamic phenomenological abundance that we can\nnever fully grasp or finally\n master.[69]\nBy partly informing and yet always also\npartly eluding our attempts to order those aspects the earth offers to\nour understanding into a single, final historical \u201cworld,\u201d\nthe abundant earth preserves itself for future orderings, for worlds\nstill yet to be\n disclosed.[70]\n",
