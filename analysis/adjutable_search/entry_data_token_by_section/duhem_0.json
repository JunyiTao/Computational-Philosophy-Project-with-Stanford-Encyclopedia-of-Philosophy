    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nPierre Maurice Marie Duhem was born on June 10, 1861, in Paris, in a\nmodest neighborhood on the Rue des Je\u00fbneurs, near the Grands\nBoulevards, just South of Montmartre. His father, Pierre-Joseph Duhem,\nwas of Flemish origin, the oldest child of a large family who lived in\nthe French northern industrial city of Roubaix, near the Belgian\nborder. After the death of his parents, Pierre-Joseph was forced to\ndiscontinue his studies with the Jesuits in order to provide for the\nfamily. He worked in the textile industry as a sales representative,\nbut never abandoned his love of learning; it is said that, late in\nlife, he was seen everywhere with the work of a Latin author under his\narm. Pierre Duhem\u2019s mother, Marie-Alexandrine Fabre, descended on\nher mother\u2019s side from the Hubault-Delormes, a bourgeois family\nwho had settled in Paris during the seventeenth century. Her\nfather\u2019s family had originally come from the southern town of\nCabesprine, near Carcasonne, and it was there, in a house they still\nmaintained and to which Pierre returned most summers, that he died on\nSeptember 14, 1916.\n\n\nThe Duhems made sure that Pierre was well educated. Starting at the\nage of seven he was given private lessons with a small group of\nstudents, on grammar, arithmetic, Latin, and catechism. A letter he\nwrote about the siege of Chateaudun he experienced in October 1870\nattests to his being already a literate writer by the age of nine. The\nyoung Duhem was witness to some troubling times, with the\nFranco-Prussian War raging until the armistice in February 1871 and the\nParis Commune in March. The Duhems had avoided the advance of the\nPrussians against Paris but were caught up in the siege of Chateaudun;\nthey barely escaped to Bordeaux, returning to Paris after the armistice\nand just before the Paris Commune. That social experiment lasted only\ntwo months, though it set the stage for some wide-ranging\ntransformations to French culture that were to have great consequences\nwhen they were later established permanently. Among the Commune\u2019s\ndecrees were the separation of church from state, the rendering of all\nchurch property into public property, and the exclusion of religion\nfrom schools. The Duhems did not approve of these measures and were\nparticularly chagrined by some of the extreme actions taken by the most\nradical elements of the Commune, such as the desecration of churches\nand graveyards. For the Duhems, the Commune was a paradigm of anarchy\nand irreligion.\n\n\nThe Fall of 1872 brought two great tragedies to the Duhem family: a\ndiphtheria epidemic killed Pierre\u2019s younger sister Antoinette and\nhis recently born brother Jean, leaving only Pierre and\nAntoinette\u2019s twin sister Marie. Pierre continued his education\n(as demi-pensionnaire) at a Catholic school, the\nColl\u00e8ge Stanislas in Paris, in 1872 and for the next ten years.\nThe mature Duhem recalled his college days as most formative. In\nparticular, he singled out his science teacher as an important\ninfluence:\n\n\nLet us return to some twenty-five years back to the time when we\nreceived our first initiation as a physicist in the mathematics classes\nof the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas. The person who gave us this\ninitiation, Jules Moutier, was an ingenious theorist; his critical\nsense, ever aware and extremely perspicacious, distinguished with sure\naccuracy the weak point of many a system that others accepted without\ndispute; proofs of his inquiring mind are not lacking, and physical\nchemistry owes him one of its most important laws. It was this teacher\nwho planted in us our admiration for physical theory and the desire to\ncontribute to its progress. \u2026 Being a disciple of Moutier, it\nwas as a convinced partisan of mechanism that we approached the courses\nin physics pursued at the Ecole Normale. (1914, 417\u201318; 1954,\n275\u201376.)\n\n\nDuhem\u2019s science teacher Jules Moutier went on to teach at the\nEcole Polytechnique and to publish a number of texts, including La\nthermodynamique et ses principales applications (Paris:\nGauthier-Villars, 1885). Duhem recognized in his theory of chemical\ndissociation and in his thermodynamics generally a first enunciation of\nthe chemical theories that Josiah Willard Gibbs, an important later\ninfluence on Duhem, was to develop more fully.\n\n\nIn 1882 Duhem enrolled at the prestigious secular institution of higher\neducation, the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. When he entered the\nEcole Normale he was first in his class in the Science Section, out of\nthe approximately 30 students chosen from the best 800 or so graduates\nin France that year, and he remained first throughout his years there.\nThe curriculum at the Ecole Normale usually lasted three years; Duhem\nwas granted a fourth year and stayed on a fifth year as\nagr\u00e9g\u00e9 pr\u00e9parateur. He received a\nlicense in mathematics and another in physics at the end of\nacademic year 1883\u201384. In his final year, Duhem was offered a position\nin Louis Pasteur\u2019s laboratory as a chemist-bacteriologist, though\nhe refused it because of his desire to work in theoretical physics.\n\n\nOne of the turning points in Duhem\u2019s career occurred during\nacademic year 1884\u201385, while he was only a third-year student. Duhem\npresented a thesis in physics for his doctorate. The thesis, on\nthermodynamic potential, Le potentiel thermodynamique et ses\napplications \u00e0 la m\u00e9canique chimique et \u00e0\nl\u2019\u00e9tude des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes\n\u00e9lectriques, was rejected by a panel composed of three\nscholars: the physicist Gabriel Lippmann and the mathematicians Charles\nHermite and Emile Picard. The panel, chaired by Lippmann, seems to have\nmade a political decision. The prestigious French scientific publisher,\nHermann, published a version of the thesis the following year. Duhem\ndefended another thesis in applied mathematics, on the theory of\nmagnetization by induction, Sur l\u2019aimantation par\ninfluence, and received his doctorate in October 1888; this time,\nthe physicist Edmond Bouty, the mathematician Gaston Darboux, and the\nmathematician-physicist Henri Poincar\u00e9 constituted the panel\nthat accepted the dissertation. It would be difficult to understand\nfully these events without delving deeply into the social, cultural,\nand intellectual context of France at the end of the nineteenth\ncentury. At a time when French scientists were predominantly liberal\nand anti-clerical, Duhem was openly conservative and deeply religious;\nhe was also stubborn and often contentious. The structure of French\nacademia was surely also a factor in the affair. However, the specific\nmotives generally cited in the case were Lipmann\u2019s\n\u201cjealousy\u201d and the fact that Duhem\u2019s thesis refuted\nthe principle of maximum work: that chemical changes tend spontaneously\nto produce maximum heat. It was one of the cherished theses of Marcellin\nBerthelot, Lippmann\u2019s friend and a significant power in the\nFrench scientific establishment. It was reported that Berthelot had\nsaid: \u201cThis young man will never teach in Paris.\u201d\nBerthelot\u2019s edict came true. Duhem spent his academic career in\nprovincial universities far from Paris, the center of academic life in\nFrance. His teaching positions brought him from Lille, then briefly to\nRennes, then to Bordeaux for the remainder of his life, but never to\nParis.\n\n\nDuhem assumed the position of Maitre de Conf\u00e9rences at the\nFacult\u00e9 des Sciences at Lille in October 1887. There he met\nAd\u00e8le Chayet, whom he married in October 1890. Their daughter\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne was born in September 1891. Tragically,\nAd\u00e8le died in childbirth the following summer; the newborn\nchild also did not survive. Duhem never remarried. He left the\nupbringing of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to his mother who lived with him\nafter his father Pierre-Joseph died. The situation in Lille soured for\nDuhem. Never one to back off from a dispute, he fought with the Dean\nof his faculty over a minor issue: an assistant had failed to unlock\nthe door of Duhem\u2019s laboratory for his students during their\nlicentiate examinations. The assistant complained about his\nmistreatment by Duhem to the Dean, who requested that the assistant\nwrite a letter of apology; Duhem rejected the apology and took issue\nwith the Dean, who then brought the matter to the Rector, adding\nfurther complaints against Duhem. The minor issue having escalated to\nimmense proportions, Duhem requested and received a change of\npositions at the end of academic year 1893. During these formative\nyears, Duhem worked very hard on his science. He published six books:\na two-volume work on hydrodynamics, elasticity, and acoustics, his\nlectures on electricity and magnetism, in three volumes, and an\nintroduction to physical chemistry. Duhem was one of the first to\nappreciate the work of W. J.  Gibbs, writing the earliest critical\nexamination of Gibbs\u2019 \u201cOn the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous\nSubstances\u201d in 1887 and later promoting the French translation\nof Gibbs\u2019 works (Duhem 1907); for an English translation of\nDuhem\u2019s 1887 essay on Gibbs and his Commentaries on the\nPrinciples of Thermodynamics, 1892\u20131894, see Duhem [CPT].\n\nIn October 1893, Duhem left Lille for Rennes. He lasted only one year,\nleaving for Bordeaux in October 1894. He was hoping for a position in\nParis. The prodigious quantity and quality of his publications in many\nfields of science, the philosophy of science, and the history of\nscience were not able to change his situation. Very late in life, he\nwas approached about the newly created chair in the History of Science\nat the Coll\u00e8ge de France, but he refused to be a candidate for\nit. The proud and stubborn Duhem told his daughter: \u201cI am a\ntheoretical physicist. Either I will teach theoretical physics at Paris\nor else I will not go there.\u201d\n\n\nDuhem\u2019s curriculum vitae, written in 1913, on the occasion of his\nnomination as non-resident member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences\n(1917, 41\u201370), lists over 350 items, about 50 of which were books. From\nthe mid-1880s to 1900, Duhem\u2019s primary interests were scientific,\nranging from thermodynamics and physics, but publishing on elasticity\nand energetics as late as 1911. In the 1890s, while still at Lille, he\nbegan writing essays on questions of methodology that would lead to the\npublication of his most influential books in the philosophy of science,\ntranslated into English as The Aim and Structure of Physical\nTheory and To Save the Phenomena. It was also in the\nmid-1890s that Duhem published his first essays in the history of\nscience, starting on the path that would lead him in 1904 to a new\nunderstanding of the history of science and to his thesis of continuity\nbetween medieval and early modern science. This path would culminate in\nsuch important historical works as \u00c9tudes sur L\u00e9onard\nde Vinci and Le syst\u00e8me du monde.\n\n\nDuhem made a number of enduring contributions to thermodynamics and\nphysical chemistry. Among these were the Duhem\u2013Margules and\nGibbs\u2013Duhem equations, which deal with reversible processes in\nthermodynamics as quasi-static limiting processes and give a general\nproof of the Gibbs phase rule. These results were obtained in the\ncontext of a program of generalized thermodynamics called\n\u201cenergetics.\u201d Indeed, Duhem\u2019s entire scientific\nprogram was driven by the conviction that a generalized thermodynamics\nshould be foundational for physical theory, thinking that all of\nchemistry and physics, including mechanics, electricity and magnetism,\nshould be derivable from thermodynamic first principles. Duhem started\nfrom the concept of the thermodynamic potential (the topic of his\nfailed thesis), deploying it in a manner similar to that of potentials\nin mechanics, so as to represent all physical and chemical changes. The\nprogram finds its mature statement in his Trait\u00e9\nd\u2019\u00e9nerg\u00e9tique of 1911; it was well received by\nlate-nineteenth-century energeticists, such as Wilhelm Ostwald and\nGeorg Helm. So important was energetics for Duhem, that his work in the\nhistory and philosophy of science has been viewed as an attempt to\ndefend its aims and methods (see Lowinger 1941). More recently, Niall\nMartin and others have argued for the importance of religious motives\nin Duhem\u2019s work (see Martin 1991, Jaki 1991) and it has become\nclear in the course of Duhem\u2019s writings that he expected the\nendpoint of science to harmonize with the teachings of the Catholic\nChurch.\n\n\nWhatever was Duhem\u2019s initial motivation, his historical and\nphilosophical work took on a life of its own. One cannot read\nDuhem\u2019s numerous historical and philosophical tomes and think\nthat his labor was only in the service of energetics and that the sole\ngoal of his works was but a defense of its methods and its historical\nposition. No doubt energetics might be a thread running through\nDuhem\u2019s various works, and no doubt these works harmonize with\nthe method of energetics as he conceives it, but energetics cannot be\nthe whole story.\n",
