    "main_text": "\n\nThe demarcation between science and pseudoscience is part of the\nlarger task of determining which beliefs are epistemically warranted.\nThis entry clarifies the specific nature of pseudoscience in relation\nto other categories of non-scientific doctrines and practices,\nincluding science denial(ism) and resistance to the facts. The major\nproposed demarcation criteria for pseudo-science are discussed and\nsome of their weaknesses are pointed out. There is much more agreement\non particular cases of demarcation than on the general criteria that\nsuch judgments should be based upon. This is an indication that there\nis still much important philosophical work to be done on the\ndemarcation between science and pseudoscience.\n",
