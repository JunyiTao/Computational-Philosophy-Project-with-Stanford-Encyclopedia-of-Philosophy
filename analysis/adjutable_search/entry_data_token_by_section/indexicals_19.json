    "main_text": "Indexical Belief and Indexical Semantics\n4. Indexical Belief and Indexical Semantics\n\n\nIndexical beliefs are, roughly speaking, beliefs that agents are\ndisposed to express by uttering sentences that contain indexicals. If\nMary utters \u2018I am a philosopher\u2019, \u2018You are a\nphilosopher\u2019, \u2018She is a philosopher\u2019 (while\ndemonstrating someone), \u2018The weather is good today\u2019, or\n\u2018John is here\u2019, then she expresses an indexical belief.\nIndexical desires and indexical intentions are,\nroughly speaking, desires and intentions that agents can express by\nuttering sentences containing indexicals, such as \u2018I want you to\nwin the game\u2019 and \u2018I shall follow you\u2019. Thus, we can\nspeak more generally of indexical attitudes. (In this\nparagraph, and for most of the rest of section 4, we use\n\u2018belief\u2019 as a term for events or states of believing\npropositions, rather than for propositions that are believed. We use\n\u2018desire\u2019, \u2018intention\u2019, and\n\u2018attitude\u2019 similarly.)\n\n\nIndexical beliefs are sometimes called self-locating\nbeliefs (Perry 1977), because the beliefs that one has when one knows\nwho one is, where one is, and when one is, are often expressed by\nuttering sentences containing \u2018I\u2019, \u2018here\u2019,\n\u2018now\u2019, and other indexicals. Indexical beliefs that can be\nexpressed with \u2018I\u2019 are sometimes (following Lewis 1979)\ncalled \u2018de se beliefs\u2019. (\u2018De\nse\u2019 is Latin for \u2018of oneself\u2019.) Those expressed\nwith \u2018now\u2019 are sometimes called \u2018de nunc\nbeliefs\u2019. (\u2018De nunc\u2019 is Latin for \u2018of\nnow\u2019.) Some philosophers hold that indexical beliefs are de\nre beliefs, which are beliefs of objects.\n(\u2018De re\u2019 is Latin for of objects.) For\nexample, some would say that the belief that Mary expresses by uttering\n\u2018You are a philosopher\u2019 to Bill is a de re belief\nconcerning Bill.\n\n\nSome philosophers hold that indexical attitudes, and so indexicals\nthemselves, are important to understanding philosophically significant\nphenomena such as the following: Agency and explanation of action\n(Casta\u00f1eda 1975; Perry 1979, 2000; McGinn 1983; and the\nentry on \n action);\nself-consciousness, subjectivity, and the first-person perspective\n(Nagel 1986, McDowell 1998); consciousness and qualia (Perry 1999; \nand the entries on \n  consciousness and \n  qualia);\nperceptual content (Egan 2006;  and the entry on \n  the contents of perception);\n immunity to error\nthrough misidentification (Shoemaker 1968); secondary qualities (McGinn\n1983; Egan 2006); and various issues in moral philosophy (Velleman\n1999; Hare 2007). For skepticism about the importance of indexicals to\none or more of these topics, see Millikan 1990, Cappelen and Dever\n2013, and Magidor forthcoming.\n\n\nWe shall concentrate here on the seeming implications that the\ntheory of indexical semantics has for the theory of indexical belief,\nand vice versa. To grasp these seeming mutual implications, consider\nsentence (16) below.\n\n(16)\n\nYou are a philosopher.\n\n\n\nSuppose that John understands sentence (16) and assertively utters\n(16) while addressing Mary and intending to refer to her. Then,\nplausibly, John asserts the proposition that (16) semantically\nexpresses in his context. Moreover, if John is sincere, then he\nbelieves the proposition that (16) expresses in his context.\nThus a semantic theory that describes the content of sentence (16) in\nJohn\u2019s context also describes a proposition that he believes.\nHence the theory of indexical semantics has implications for the theory\nof indexical belief. Theories of indexical belief can also have\nimportant implications for the semantics of indexicals. If, for\ninstance, speakers do not believe the propositions that a semantic\ntheory assigns to indexical sentences, relative to contexts, then that\nis prima facie reason to reject that semantic theory.\n\n\nThe remainder of this section will be dedicated to considering\nindexical belief and its implications for indexical semantics. (We\nshall, however, try to avoid discussing the semantics of belief\nascriptions. See instead the entry on \n  propositional attitude reports.)\n",
