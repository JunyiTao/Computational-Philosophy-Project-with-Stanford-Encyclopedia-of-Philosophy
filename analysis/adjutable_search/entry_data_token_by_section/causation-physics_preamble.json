    "main_text": "\n\nWhat role, if any, do causal notions play in physics? On the one hand,\nit might appear intuitively obvious that physics aims to provide us\nwith causal knowledge of the world and that causal claims are an\nintegral part of physics. On the other hand, there is an influential\nphilosophical tradition, dating back to Ernst Mach and to Bertrand\nRussell\u2019s extremely influential article \u201cOn the Notion of\nCause\u201d (1912), denying the applicability or at least the\nusefulness of causal notions in physics. While this tradition is\nperhaps not as dominant today than it once was, there continues to be\na lively and active philosophical debate on whether causal notions can\nplay a legitimate role in physics and, if yes, what role that might\nbe. This entry surveys the main arguments in this debate focusing in\nparticular on arguments appealing to putatively distinguishing\ncharacteristics of theorizing in physics.\n",
