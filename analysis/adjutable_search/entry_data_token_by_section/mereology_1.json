Core Principles\n\nWith these provisos, and barring for the moment the complications\narising from the consideration of intensional factors (such as time\nand modalities), we may proceed to review some core mereological\nnotions and principles. Ideally, we may distinguish here between (a)\nthose principles that are simply meant to fix the intended meaning of\nthe relational predicate \u2018part\u2019, and (b) a variety of\nadditional, more substantive principles that go beyond the obvious and\naim at greater sophistication and descriptive power. Exactly where the\nboundary between (a) and (b) should be drawn, however, or even whether\na boundary of this sort can be drawn at all, is by itself a matter of\ncontroversy. \n",
