    "main_text": "\n\nEpiphenomenalism is the view that mental events are caused by physical\nevents in the brain, but have no effects upon any physical events.\nBehavior is caused by muscles that contract upon receiving neural\nimpulses, and neural impulses are generated by input from other\nneurons or from sense organs. On the epiphenomenalist view, mental\nevents play no causal role in this process. Huxley (1874), who held\nthe view, compared mental events to a steam whistle that contributes\nnothing to the work of a locomotive. James (1879), who rejected the\nview, characterized epiphenomenalists\u2019 mental events as not\naffecting the brain activity that produces them \u201cany more than a\nshadow reacts upon the steps of the traveller whom it\naccompanies\u201d.\n\nAncient theories of the soul gave rise to debates among\nAristotle\u2019s successors that have a strong resemblance to some\ncontemporary discussions of the efficacy of mental events (Caston,\n1997). The modern discussion of epiphenomenalism, however, traces back\nto a 19th century context, in which a dualistic view of mental events\nwas assumed to be correct. The first part of our discussion \u2014\nTraditional Arguments \u2014 will be phrased in a style that reflects\nthis dualistic presupposition. By contrast, many contemporary\ndiscussions work within a background assumption of the preferability\nof materialist monism. One might have supposed that this position\nwould have put an end to the need to investigate epiphenomenalism;\nbut, as we shall see under Arguments in the Age of Materialism, such a\nsupposition is far from being the case. A brief outline of both\ndiscussions follows.\n",
