    "main_text": "Strong Emergence\n4. Strong Emergence\n\nStrong emergentists maintain that at least some higher-level\nphenomena exhibit a weaker dependence/stronger autonomy than weak\nemergence permits. This often takes the form of rejecting physical\nrealization, affirming fundamental higher-level causal\npowers, or both.\n\nPerhaps the most commonly cited phenomena offered as requiring strong\nemergentist treatment have to do with the nature and capacities of the\nconscious mind in relation to its neural substrate. Other non-mental,\nscientific phenomena also have been advanced as possibly or plausibly\nrequiring treatment in strong emergentist terms. Such claims are\ncanvassed in\n section 5.\n",
