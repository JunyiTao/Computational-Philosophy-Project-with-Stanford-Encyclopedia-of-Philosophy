    "main_text": "Philosophical themes || Ontology\n3.2 Ontology\n\n\nAlthough it would have seemed artificial to Ficino to separate certain\nareas of philosophizing from each other, nevertheless, it is useful,\nas a heuristic device, to consider subjects such as ontology\nseparately (see Allen 1982). And here, in the context of discussing\nbeing and its levels, without doubt Ficino\u2019s first debt was to\nPlotinus. Plotinus had expressed himself variously, but it is not\ninaccurate to say that, for him, there had been four general levels to\nthe cosmos, beginning with The One (to hen). This level\nrepresented, for Plotinus, a hybrid of Plato\u2019s Form of the Good and\nAristotle\u2019s prime mover. It stood at the summit of the ontological\nhierarchy and was so great, indeed, that it was outside of Being\nitself. It was everywhere, \u201cfilling all things,\u201d yet it\nwas also nowhere, since it must be distinct from the world it created\n(Enneads, 3.9.4). Thinking, it overflowed into the next\nontological level, Mind, which in succession overflowed into Soul,\nwhich overflowed into a fourth realm that included Nature, Matter, and\nSensation. Just as Plotinus varied his descriptions of these\nontological levels throughout the Enneads, so too did Ficino\n(Allen 1982). That said, Ficino did, in numerous places, suggest a\nfive-part (instead of a four-part) ontological scheme, which began\nwith God, followed by Angelic Mind, Rational Soul (in which human\nbeings take part), \u201cQuality\u201d (a kind of ontological glue\nthat stands between matter and soul), and finally matter, the level in\nwhich we human beings are embodied and from which we must try to\nliberate ourselves by living a philosophical life. \n\n\nFicino\u2019s ontology thus shared aspects with Plotinus\u2019s, including: the\nhierarchy which human beings, through their birth and appearance in\nthe world, have descended; the importance of meditation and\nphilosophical practices in fashioning re-ascent; the presence of\n\u201csympathies,\u201d or hidden connections (which the properly\nobservant philosopher could find and reveal) between material and\ncelestial things that helped link the different levels of the\nhierarchy; and the hierarchy\u2019s background of Platonic echoes (such as\nthe cave imagery from the Republic and the same dialogue\u2019s\nmyth of Er, and the post-death journey in the\nPhaedo).\n",
