    "main_text": "Resistance\n2. Resistance\n\nThe use of the word \u201cresistance\u201d in \u201cimaginative\nresistance\u201d has been criticized for privileging one of the rival\nexplanations of imaginative resistance over the others. Three main\nrival explanations of imaginative resistance have been provided thus\nfar: the Cantian, the Wontian, and the Eliminativist (Gendler 2006\ncoined the first two terms; Gendler and Liao 2016 the third one).\nEliminativists deny that the phenomenon exists outside\nphilosophers\u2019 carefully constructed vignettes. The remaining\ncamps, while accepting the existence of the phenomenon, present\ncompeting explanations of it. Cantians claim that imaginative\nresistance occurs when we can\u2019t engage in the prompted\nimaginative activity. Wontians, by contrast take the phenomenon to\ninvolve unwillingness (rather than inability) to engage on\nthe part of the reader or the audience. Cantians and eliminativists\nhave been critical of the use of the word \u201cresistance\u201d\nbecause the term itself seems to privilege the Wontian explanation.\nEven though some philosophers choose to use \u201cimaginative\nfailure\u201d instead of \u201cimaginative resistance\u201d, the\nreplacement term has not stuck\u2014after all, this entry itself is\ntitled \u201cimaginative resistance\u201d (see Stock 2005, Brock\n2012, Stear 2015, Tooming 2018). With the acknowledgment that\n\u201cimaginative resistance\u201d is an umbrella term for the\nphenomenon that some prefer to explain not in terms of\nresistance but inability, let\u2019s have a closer\nlook at competing explanations of imaginative resistance. \n",
