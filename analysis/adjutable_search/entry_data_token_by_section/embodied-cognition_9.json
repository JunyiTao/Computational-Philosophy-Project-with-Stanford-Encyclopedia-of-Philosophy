    "main_text": "Conceptualization || Metaphor and Basic Concepts\n3.1 Metaphor and Basic Concepts\n\n\nLakoff and Johnson (1980; 1999) offered an early and influential\ndefense of Conceptualization. Their argument begins with the plausible\npremise that human beings rely extensively upon metaphorical reasoning\nwhen learning or developing an understanding of unfamiliar concepts.\nImagine, for instance, trying to explain to a child the meaning of\nelection. Drawing a connection between election and a\nconcept the child already understands, like foot race, makes\nthe job easier. The \u201celections are races\u201d metaphor provides\na kind of scaffolding for introducing and explaining the content of the\nelection concept. Candidates are like runners hoping\nto win the race. They will adopt various strategies.\nThey must be careful not to start too fast or they might\nburn out before reaching the finish line. It\u2019s about\nendurance through the long stretch\u2014more a\nmarathon than a sprint. Some will play\ndirty, trying to trip others up, knocking them off their\nstride. There will be sore losers but also\ngraceful winners. Appeal to the content of a familiar\nconcept\u2014foot race\u2014provides the child with a\nframework or stance for learning the unfamiliar\nconcept\u2014election.\n\n\nThe next step toward the embodiment of concepts proceeds with the\nobservation that, through pain of regress, not all concepts can be\nacquired through metaphorical scaffolding. There must be a class of\nbasic concepts that (if not innate) we learn some other way.\nLakoff and Johnson argue that these basic concepts derive from the\nkinds of \u201cdirect physical experience\u201d (1980: 57) that come\nfrom moving a human body through the environment. The concept\nup, for instance, is basic, emerging from possession of a body\nthat stands erect, so that \u201c[a]lmost every movement we make\ninvolves a motor program that either changes our up-down orientation,\nmaintains it, presupposes it, or takes it into account in some\nway\u201d (1980, 56). Lakoff and Johnson offer a similar account for\nhow human beings come to possess concepts like front,\nback, pushing, pulling, and so on.\n\n\nBasic concepts reflect the idiosyncrasies of particular kinds of\nbodies. Insofar as less-basic concepts depend upon metaphorical\nextensions of these most basic concepts, they will in turn reflect the\nidiosyncrasies of particular kinds of bodies. All concepts, Lakoff and\nJohnson appear to believe, are \u201cstamped\u201d with the\nbody\u2019s imprint as the characteristics of the body \u201ctrickle\nup\u201d into more abstract concepts. They thus arrive at\nConceptualization: \u201cthe peculiar nature of our bodies shapes our\nvery possibilities for conceptualization and categorization\u201d\n(1999, 19). Insofar as this is true, one should expect that\ndifferently-bodied organisms, equipped with a different class of basic\nconcepts, would conceptualize and categorize their worlds in nonhuman\nways.\n\n\nAlthough Lakoff and Johnson see Conceptualization as incompatible with\ncomputational cognitive science, their grounds for doing so are\ntenuous. Metaphorical reasoning consists in applying aspects of one\nconcept\u2019s content to that of another. Because such reasoning is\nexplicitly about content, and because computationalism is a theory\nabout how to process mental states in virtue of their content, Lakoff\nand Johnson\u2019s antagonism toward computationalism seems\nunwarranted. Additionally, their case for Conceptualization remains\nlargely a priori. They claim that organisms morphologically\ndistinct from human beings\u2014spherical in shape, say\u2014would\nbe unable to develop some human concepts (1980, 57), but with no such\nbeings available to test, this assertion is entirely speculative.\n",
