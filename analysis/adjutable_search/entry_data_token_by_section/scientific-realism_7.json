    "main_text": "Considerations Against Scientific Realism (and Responses) || Skepticism about Inference to the Best Explanation\n3.2 Skepticism about Inference to the Best Explanation\n\nOne especially important reaction to concerns about the alleged\nunderdetermination of theory by data gives rise to another leading\nantirealist argument. This reaction is to reject one of the key\npremises of the argument from underdetermination, viz. that\nevidence for belief in a theory is exhausted by the empirical data.\nMany realists contend that other considerations\u2014most\nprominently, explanatory considerations\u2014play an\nevidential role in scientific inference. If this is so, then even if\none were to grant the idea that all theories have empirically\nequivalent rivals, this would not entail underdetermination, for the\nexplanatory superiority of one in particular may determine a choice\n(Laudan 1990; Day & Botterill 2008). This is a specific\nexemplification of a form of reasoning by which \u201cwe infer what\nwould, if true, provide the best explanation of [the] evidence\u201d\n(Lipton [1991] 2004: 1). To put a realist-sounding spin on it: \n\n\none infers, from the premise that a given hypothesis would provide a\n\u201cbetter\u201d explanation for the evidence than would any other\nhypothesis, to the conclusion that the given hypothesis is true.\n(Harman 1965: 89) \n\n\nInference to the best explanation (as per Lipton\u2019s formulation)\nseems ubiquitous in scientific practice. The question of whether it\ncan be expected to yield knowledge of the sort suggested by realism\n(as per Harman\u2019s formulation) is, however, a matter of\ndispute.\n\nTwo difficulties are immediately apparent regarding the realist\naspiration to infer truth (approximate truth, existence of entities,\netc.) from hypotheses or theories that are judged best on explanatory\ngrounds. The first concerns the grounds themselves. In order to judge\nthat one theory furnishes a better explanation of some phenomenon than\nanother, one must employ some criterion or criteria on the basis of\nwhich the judgment is made. Many have been proposed: simplicity\n(whether of mathematical description or in terms of the number or\nnature of the entities involved); consistency and coherence (both\ninternally, and externally with respect to other theories and\nbackground knowledge); scope and unity (pertaining to the domain of\nphenomena explained); and so on. One challenge here concerns whether\nvirtues such as these can be defined precisely enough to permit\nrelative rankings of explanatory goodness. Another challenge concerns\nthe multiple meanings associated with some virtues (consider, for\nexample, mathematical versus ontological simplicity). Another concerns\nthe possibility that such virtues may not all favor any one theory in\nparticular. Finally, there is the question of whether these virtues\nshould be considered evidential or epistemic, as opposed to merely\npragmatic. What reason is there to think, for instance, that\nsimplicity is an indicator of truth? Thus, the ability to rank\ntheories with respect to their likelihood of being true may be\nquestioned.\n\nA second difficulty facing inference to the best explanation concerns\nthe pools of theories regarding which judgments of relative\nexplanatory efficacy are made. Even if scientists are likely reliable\nrankers of theories with respect to truth, this will not lead to\nbelief in a true theory (in some domain) unless that theory in\nparticular happens to be among those considered. Otherwise, as van\nFraassen (1989: 143) notes, one may simply end up with \u201cthe best\nof a bad lot\u201d. Given the widespread view, even among realists,\nthat many and perhaps most of our best theories are false, strictly\nspeaking, this concern may seem especially pressing. However, in just\nthe way that the realist strategy of selectivity (see\n section 2.3)\n may offer responses to the question of what it could mean for a\ntheory to be close to the truth without being true\nsimpliciter, this same strategy may offer the beginnings of a\nresponse here. That is to say, the best theory of a bad lot may\nnonetheless describe unobservable aspects of the world in such a way\nas to meet the standards of variants of realism including\nexplanationism, entity realism, and structural realism.
