This system, instead, becomes essential in the\nlater Waidan traditions and in virtually the whole of Neidan. The\nfoundations of this new model of doctrine and practice were provided\nby the Cantong qi (Seal of the Unity of the Three),\ntraditionally said to be written in the 2nd century CE but\ndating from between the mid-5th and the mid-7th\ncentury (Pregadio 2011). Scores of texts both within and outside the\nDaoist Canon are related to this work. Although its views have been\nunderstood mainly in relation to Neidan, they also apply to\nWaidan.\n\nThe Cantong qi and its tradition use several sets of emblems\nthat represent different aspects of the relation of the cosmos to the\nDao. The main set is formed by four trigrams of the Book of\nChanges, namely Qian \u2630, Kun \u2637,\nKan \u2635, and Li \u2632, which represent the\nmodes taken on by the Dao in its self-manifestation. Qian\nstands for the active (Yang) aspect of the Dao, and Kun stands\nfor its passive (Yin) aspect. Their permanent conjunction in\nthe precosmic domain gives birth to the cosmos. The Yang of\nQian \u2630 moves into Kun \u2637, which becomes\nKan \u2635; in response, the Yin of Kun\n\u2637 moves into Qian \u2630, which becomes Li\n\u2632. In the cosmos, therefore, the Yin contains True\nYang (the inner solid line of Kan \u2635), and the\nYang contains True Yin (the inner broken line of\nLi \u2632).\n\nOn the basis of these principles, the only form of alchemical practice\nsanctioned by the Cantong qi and by the works that follow its\nsystem is the one that enables the conjunction of Qian and\nKun, or True Yang and True Yin. According\nto the Cantong qi, only True Lead and True Mercury are\n\u201cof the same kind\u201d (tonglei) as Qian and\nKun. The Yin and Yang entities that\ncontain these authentic principles are \u201cblack\nlead\u201d (i.e., native lead) and cinnabar, respectively. In the strict sense of\nthe term, alchemy therefore consists in extracting True Lead from\n\u201cblack lead\u201d and True Mercury from cinnabar, and in\njoining them to one another. This is accomplished in Waidan by using\nthe corresponding minerals and metals, and in Neidan by operating on\nvarious components of the human body\u2014both physical and\nnon-physical\u2014which are symbolically denoted by the same\nterms.\n",
