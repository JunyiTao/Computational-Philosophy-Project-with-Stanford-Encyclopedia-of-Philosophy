There followed several\ndecades of economic expansion and rising prosperity for urban,\nindustrial workers among whom were large numbers of Black workers,\ndescendants of earlier migrants to the urban centers, who benefitted\nfrom the industrial intensifications and thus expanded significantly\nthe growing modern, educated, increasingly economically viable,\nchurch-going, community-sustaining, psychologically secure and\nincreasingly self-confident aspiring Black working and middle classes\nthat were determined to provide successive generations with greater\nfreedom, respect, and economic security bolstered by high expectations\nfor even greater successes and achievements. Spread across both classes\nwere the tens of thousands of Black men who returned to civilian life\nfrom the country\u2019s recently racially integrated Armed Forces\nafter serving at home and overseas to help \u201cmake the world save\nfor democracy.\u201d A great many of these veterans, supported by\nNegro women and men who kept the home-front while enduring the\ndifficulties of wartime sacrifices as they worked the nation\u2019s\nfields and factories though still denied the fullness of citizenship,\nwere unwilling to acquiesce to the subordination to racial apartheid\nand invidious racial discrimination required by the doctrines and\nprograms of White Racial Supremacy that still held sway.\n\n\nThis context became the nurturing soil in which various forms of Black\nNationalism flowered once again as the influence of Washington\u2019s\nphilosophy and strategies declined. Caribbean-born immigrant Marcus\nGarvey (\u201cRace Assimilation,\u201d 1922; 1992; \u201cThe True\nSolution of the Negro Problem,\u201d 1922; 1992; \u201cAn Appeal to the\nConscience of the Black Race to See Itself,\u201d 1923; 1992), proponent of\na militant Black Nationalist philosophy of independence and\nself-reliance for Black peoples world-wide, and of the emigration of\npeople of African descent from the U.S. and elsewhere \u201cback to\nAfrica,\u201d rose to prominence from his base in New York City as\nthe most successful mass organizer of Black people in the history of\nthe U.S. with the founding and internationalization of his United\nNegro Improvement Association (UNIA) (Garvey 1925; 1986; Martin\n1986). Garvey\u2019s organizational and socio-political movement,\nfueled by his \u201cPhilosophy and Opinions\u201d carried by his\norganization\u2019s newspapers and other publications with\ninternational reach, along with the eruption of the Harlem\nRenaissance, likewise in New York, an eruption of literary and\nartistic productions motivated by very thoughtful and passionate\naffirmations of African ancestry and of the positive, creative\nimportance of the cultural and aesthetic significance of African\nAmerican life, were two of the most significant emigrationist and\ncultural nationalist developments of the period. Both were articulated\nthrough and otherwise spawned new, profoundly influential modes of\ncreative, reflective thought and expression.\n\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance was an extraordinary eruption of heightened,\ncritical, and creative self-conscious affirmative racial identification\nby thoughtful Negroes bent on expressing their affirmations of their\nraciality through all of the creative arts and modalities of\narticulation, a development unprecedented in the history of the\npresence of peoples of African descent in the United States (Huggins 2007). The\ncultural significance of the productions and articulations; of the\nengagements, practices, and creations of the bold and talented\nparticipant-contributors; of the organizations, institutions, and\npublications they created and endeavored to sustain (some successfully,\nmany others not) devoted to culture creation, refinement, preservation,\nand mediation\u2014 all continue to have substantial influences even\ntoday, most especially in terms of the novel ideas and idea-spaces and\ndiscursive communities that were created and articulated through the\nbodies of literature and works of art, music, and dance that are still\nbeing mined productively by contemporary artists and scholars. The\nproducers and carriers of the Renaissance were natives of the whole of\nthe African Diaspora, across the Atlantic World especially, as well as\nfrom across the African continent, and they drew on the cultural and\nhistorical legacies of both (and on those from other parts of the world)\nfor inspiration and content for their philosophizing artistic\ncreativity in defining and giving expression to The New\nNegro.\n\n\nAlain Leroy Locke (1886\u20131954), the first African American to\nearn a Ph.D. in Philosophy, from Harvard (having already earned a\ndegree from Oxford and having studied philosophy at the University of\nBerlin), and the first to be named a Rhodes Scholar, was one of the\nsignificant intellectual and facilitating midwives to the production\nand publication of much creative work during the Renaissance (as was\nDu Bois). As the guest editor for a special March 1925 issue\nof Survey Graphic devoted to explorations of race\nand the New York of people of African descent, Locke, titling the\nissue Harlem: Mecca of the New Negro, brought together for\nthe issue writings of fiction and poetry; articles on music, drama,\nthe Negro\u2019s past, \u201cNegro Pioneers,\u201d \u201cThe New\nScene,\u201d \u201cThe Negro and the American Tradition\u201d; and\nmuch else by a racially mixed large group of authors with expertise in\na wide variety of fields. Among these: Du Bois (\u201cThe Negro Mind\nReaches Out\u201d); Elise Johnson McDougald (\u201cThe Task of Negro\nWomanhood\u201d); pioneering Africanist anthropologist Melville J.\nHerskovits (\u201cThe Negro\u2019s Americanism\u201d); sociologist\nE. Franklin Frazier (\u201cDurham: Capital of the Black Middle\nClass\u201d); the young poet and creative writer Count\u00e9e\nCullen (\u201cHeritage\u201d); Howard University-based educator and\nscholar Kelly Miller (\u201cHoward: The National Negro\nUniversity\u201d); poetess Gwendolyn B. Bennett and creative writer\nLangston Hughes writing on music; poems by Angelina Grimke; and a\nlarge number of others. After the great success of the special issue,\nLocke edited and published an anthology, The New Negro, that\nincluded revised versions of most of the material from the Survey\nGraphic special issue, but with much new material and artwork by\nWinold Reiss, a very accomplished artist from Bavaria (Locke\n1925).\n\n\nIn the judgment of many scholars of the Renaissance, The New\nNegro became, in the words of one, \u201cvirtually the central\ntext of the Harlem Renaissance.\u201d The title was taken from the\ncollection\u2019s lead essay, \u201cThe New Negro,\u201d which was\nwritten by Locke. In the essay Locke endeavored to characterize the\n\u201cNew\u201d Negro, the circumstances of the emergence of this\ncharacter-type, the nature of its shared pride-of-race character, its\npsychology and mission and relation to the Negro masses, and the\nconsequences of the emergence of the New Negro for race relations in\nthe United States and for developments in Africa and the African\nDiaspora for which this new group-figure would serve as the avant\ngarde. The anthology, then, is a gateway to an important\nselection of articulations by figures who were seminal contributors to,\nas well as beneficiaries of, the Harlem Renaissance, and to the vast\nand still growing multidisciplinary body of works that explore various\naspects, figures, contributions, and consequences of the\nRenaissance. And Locke\u2019s lead essay is a poignant gateway into\nhis career of philosophizing as well as an adept example of an attempt\nto simultaneously characterize and give agenda-setting character and\nguidance to an extraordinary praxis-guiding artistic and intellectual\nrevolution the focal points of which were determined efforts of\nracial-group self-affirmation and self-determination, beginning with\nthe radical ontological work of redefining and revaluing on\nprogressive terms the meaning of the Negro, then setting the\ntasks by which the New Negro\u2014the \u201cthinking\nNegro,\u201d as Locke characterized the group in his\nessay\u2014would lead through decidedly Negro Africanist-inspired,\nphilosophically-minded cultural creativity and articulate expressions\nof philosophizings born of struggles\u2026\n\n\nAnd lead they did, as a number of the persons, organizations, and\ninstitutions participating in and contributing to the Renaissance, the\nGarvey and other movements, and others in the social classes that were\ninspired by and fed them all became prominent figures in the Civil\nRights/Freedom Movement of the 1950s-mid 1960s during which\n\u201ccivil rights\u201d and \u201cintegration\u201d were major\nobjectives of struggle. The National Association for the Advancement\nof Colored People (NAACP), the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense\nFund (which became formally independent from the NAACP in 1957), and\nthe National Urban League were but three of several organizations that\nwould lead the continuing, but substantially reenergized,\norganizationally strengthened, and philosophically prepared and focused\nstruggles to secure legally sanctioned and guaranteed democratic\nfreedom, social and political equality, economic justice, and human\ndignity for Negroes in the United States of America. Publications and\nstatements from these and other organizations; member correspondences;\nlegal briefs and papers from court cases; the creative and scholarly\nworks from members and descendants of the Renaissance, Garvey, and\nother movements; Black newspapers of the period\u2014all are rich\nrepositories of the philosophizings fueling and guiding the new phase\nof struggle.\n\n\nStudies of these philosophizings are likely to reveal that while\nthere definitely were persons and organizations advocating radical,\neven revolutionary, transformations of the political economy and social\norders of the United States, overwhelmingly the pursuit of\ndesegregation and racial integration as important manifestations of the\nachievement of democratic freedom, social and political equality,\neconomic justice, and human dignity for Negroes using moderate but\nprogressive strategies of legal and civil-disobedience struggles were\ndominant means and agendas of social and political effort exerted by\npeople of African descent in the United States over the last\nhalf-century and more. These commitments were manifested most\nprofoundly in the Civil Rights/Freedom Movement.\n\n\u201cThe Movement,\u201d as it was experienced and known by many\nof those intimately involved, proved to be a phenomenally\nhistoric, personally and socially transformative, national movement with\nprofound international ramifications in Africa\u2014South Africa\nespecially\u2014and other countries. Initially, the attack on racial\napartheid in the quest for racial integration was pursued through legal\nchallenges to de jure racial segregation. A major victory was\nachieved with the unanimous 1954 rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court in\nBrown v. Board of Education I and II that declared\nracial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, thereby\noverturning the Court\u2019s 1896 Plessey v. Ferguson\ndecision that declared that government-sanctioned racial segregation\nwas constitutional as long as \u201cseparate but equal\u201d\nresources and facilities were provided. The team of engaged and\ncreative Black (and White) legal warriors from the NAACP Legal Defense\nand Education Fund and other thinker-scholars (historians,\nsociologists, social psychologists) were successful in persuading the\nJustices on the Court that the invidious discrimination suffered by\nBlack folks within the schemes of White-dominated racial segregation\nwas manifested not only in decidedly unequal resources and facilities,\nbut, through \u201cinferior\u201d education in Negro schools, in\ndebilitating damage to the psychic souls and self-concepts of Negroes,\nthe children especially, which severely impaired their capacity to\ndevelop into and be the kind of persons who could meet the full\nresponsibilities and enjoy the full benefits of citizenship. In short,\nthe legal team forged a legal strategy that rested on the construction\nand successful articulation of a sophisticated philosophical\nanthropology, aided by empirical psychological, sociological, and\nhistorical studies, in support of an argument regarding the vital\nlinkage between the integrity of personhood and democratic citizenship,\nthus between the enabling of democratic citizenry and the education of\nthe person free of resource-impoverishment and the distortions of the\nsoul that were consequences of hierarchic, invidious racial\ndiscrimination that was being imposed on Negro children in racially\nsegregated schools. The Court was persuaded...\n\n\nHowever, this historic victory through persuasive philosophizing was\ninitially stymied by recalcitrant, segregationist local governments and\nan overwhelming majority of White citizens in the Confederate South and\nby much foot-dragging by local governments and White citizens in other\nregions of the country. White opponents of racial integration who were\ndetermined to preserve segregation and White Supremacy unleashed yet\nanother wave of violent terrorism. Nonetheless, the advocates of\ndesegregation and integration were determined to secure full rights and\nhuman dignity for Negro Americans. A new philosophy and strategy of\nstruggle was adopted that, through the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi,\nhad proven successful in defeating Great Britain as the colonial power\ndominating India: non-violent direct action in the pursuit of justice\ngrounded in an explicit philosophical commitment to the\nsanctity of human life, including love for opponents, and to\nthe redeeming and restorative powers, personally and socially, of\nprincipled commitment to engagement in nonviolent struggle.\n\n\nGandhi\u2019s philosophy, the history and intricacies of the\nmovement he led in India, and his leadership were studied closely by a\nyoung Negro missionary to India from the United States, James Morris\nLawson, Jr., who, due to his commitments to nonviolence, had already\nbeen imprisoned for refusing induction into the military during the\nKorean War. Noting from news accounts that reached him in India that\nthe Civil Rights/Freedom Movement in the United States was gathering force,\nLawson returned to the country determined to find ways to become\ninvolved and contribute. While studying theology at Oberlin College in\npreparation for a career as a minister in service to the Movement for\nsocial justice, he was introduced to Martin Luther King, Jr., who came\nto Oberlin to deliver a speech. Lawson was persuaded by King that he (Lawson)\nshould \u201cnot wait, come now\u201d to the South to aid the\nMovement by, among other things, providing instruction in the\nphilosophy of nonviolence. Lawson transferred to the Divinity School of\nVanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and was soon deeply\nengaged in providing intellectual and spiritual guidance and inspiration\nto the educational, psychological, philosophical, and practical\npreparation of legions of mostly young college students in the city who\nwere committed to engaging in nonviolent struggle to end the\nindignities suffered by Black people as a consequence of de\njure White Supremacy and racial segregation. The campaign they\nwaged, led by Fisk University co-ed Diane Nash and with the support of\nincreasing numbers of Nashville\u2019s Black citizens, White college\nstudents, and that of more than a few very principled and dedicated\nanti-segregation White citizens, was eventually successful in bringing\nabout the formal desegregation of the city\u2019s public facilities\nand commercial establishments. Many of the Nashville Movement\u2019s\nleaders and stalwart participants, Lawson included, would become major\ncontributors to the national Movement while other student-participants\nhelped to bring about further historic transformations in the city and\nelsewhere in the South, through their courageous participation in the\nFreedom Rides, especially. (A critical, full-length biography and\nphilosophical study of James M. Lawson, Jr. and his philosophical\ncommitments and engagements have yet to be undertaken and completed\u2026)\n\n\nA philosophy of nonviolence grounded in Christian love motivated and\nguided determined Black people, and allied White and other people, in\nachieving unprecedented progressive transformations of\ncenturies-hardened, intellectually well-supported social, political,\nand, to notable extents, economic life in a United States of America\nordered since its founding by philosophies of White Racial Supremacy\nand Black racial inferiority and subordination. Martin Luther King,\nJr.  (\u201cLove, Law, and Civil Disobedience,\u201d 1961;\n\u201cThe Ethical Demands for Integration,\u201d 1963) has become\nthe signature figure among several of the leaders of this Movement,\nmarked distinctively by his profoundly thoughtful Christian\ntheological and philosophical commitments to nonviolence as the\ngrounding for personal and shared social life as well as for engaging\nin struggles for freedom and justice (Washington, J.M. 1986). However,\nthe groundwork for the Movement he would be called to lead had been\nlaid and further developed by many other organizationally-supported\nNegro women and men of articulate thought and disciplined action from\nlabor and other constituencies: among these A. Philip Randolph (who\nserved as a founding organizer and president of the Brotherhood of\nSleeping Car Porters, president of the Negro American Labor Council,\nand vice president of the AFL-CIO) and Bayard Rustin (a veteran of\nstruggles for civil and other rights for Negroes and workers of all\ncolors), who were the organizers of the 1963 March on Washington for\nJobs and Freedom during which King delivered the speech (\u201cI Have\na Dream...\u201d) in which he invoked a vision for America that became\nhis hallmark and a guiding theme of the Movement.\n\n\nCertainly, Martin Luther King, Jr. is one of the most prolific and\nprofoundly influential, even historic, figures of African descent whose\narticulations continue to compel widespread, intensive study as\nespecially rich instances of religious, moral, theological, and\nsocio-political philosophizing. Still, King\u2019s articulations, as\nwell as the sacrificial life he lived and gave in leadership service,\nfirmly and uncompromisingly grounded in especially thoughtful\ncommitments to Gandhi-inspired nonviolence (\u201cNonviolence and\nRacial Justice,\u201d 1957; \u201cThe Power of Nonviolence,\u201d\n1958) and Jesus-inspired agape love (\u201cLove, Law, and\nCivil Disobediance,\u201d 1961; \u201cA Gift of Love,\u201d 1966)\nawait full and widespread appreciation as the truly phenomenal gifts of\ninspiration, commitment, and guidance to a social movement that they\nwere. They were gifts that, infused in and channeled by the Movement,\nchanged the legal and social structures, the culture of race relations,\nand thereby the history of the United States. These gifts also inspired\nothers in their struggles for similar changes elsewhere in the world.\nThe consequences of the Movement that embodied these gifts confirmed,\nonce again, that the combination of love and nonviolent struggle could,\nindeed, succeed. And, as has been the case throughout the history of\nthe presence of persons of African descent in this country, these\nparticular philosophical gifts were neither forged and developed in,\nnor mediated to others from, the contexts of academic Philosophy, but\nwere, indeed, philosophizings born of struggles, gifts that\nchanged a country for the better that, it is feared, has yet to\nrecognize and embrace fully the confirmed lessons the gifts\nembody\u2026\n\n\nOverwhelmingly, the pursuit of desegregation and racial integration\nas goals of movements for democratic freedom, social and political\nequality, economic justice, and human dignity for Negroes has been\na dominant item on the agendas of social and political philosophies\nmotivating and guiding struggles exerted by people of African descent\nin the United States over the last half-century and more, manifested\nmost profoundly in the Civil Rights/Freedom Movement. However, the\nMovement\u2019s integrationist agenda, moral-persuasionist strategies,\ncommitment to nonviolence, and explicit commitment to a theologically and\nreligiously grounded notion of love for the Movement\u2019s opponents\nwas strongly challenged by other organizational forces (mid-1960s to\nthe early 1970s), especially by \u201cYoung Turks\u201d in the\nMovement\u2019s Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), an\ninfluential number of whom were inspired by the revolutionary\nphilosophies conveyed in the speeches, writings, and organizational\nactivities of Malcolm X and the anti-colonial engagements and writings\nof Frantz Fanon as well as by major figures in decolonizing liberation\nmovements in Africa and elsewhere that were being waged through armed\nstruggle. These Young Turks, and others in a variety of decidedly\nLeft-Nationalist organizations and proto-movements who were inspired by\nvarious notions of revolutionary transformation, initiated yet another\nresurgence of Black Nationalist aspirations and movements that came to\nbe referred to collectively as the Black Power Movement. The period was\nalso complicated by competitive conflicts with a cacophony of persons\nand organizations espousing commitments to anti-Nationalist\nmulti-racial, multi-ethnic socialist and communist agendas.\n\n\nThis was a period of unprecedented tumult, complicated by violent\nrebellions by Black people in urban centers across the country, and by the\nnation\u2019s involvement in a gone-badly-wrong and increasingly\nunpopular war in Vietnam that was highlighted all the more by national and\ninternational movements against the War led principally by young,\ncollege-age people, many of whom had come of age politically through\ntheir involvements in or educative witnessing of the Civil Rights and\nBlack Power Movements. Of particular note, a significant number of\nyoung White women who had been intimately involved in the Civil Rights,\nBlack Power, and Anti-War Movements had become increasingly poignantly\naware of the disrespect for, misuse, and underutilization of women by\nmany men in the Movements and became radicalized into forging a\nmovement to address their concerns, which was subsequently\ncharacterized as the Second Wave Feminist Movement.\n\n\nAll of these developments were fueled by and fostered intense\nintellectual adventures, some of which were also fertilized by\npractical engagements of various kinds. The Black Power Movement, in\nparticular, overlapped with and both fueled and was fueled by\nphilosophizings and engagements that were definitive of more expansive\nand consequential Black Consciousness and Black Arts Movements that, as\nhad the Harlem Renaissance of several decades earlier, spurred an\nintensive and extensive renaissance of aggressively radical and\nexpressive creativity in the arts that was centered, once again, on\nreclaiming for self-definition and self-determination the ontological\nbeing of persons and peoples of African descent, with influences, in\nmany instances, from various Leftist ventures, nationalist and\ninternationalist as well as socialist and communist. This was an\nunstable and volatile mixture that cried out for a clarifying\nphilosophy to provide guidance through the thicket of ideological\npossibilities and the agendas for personal and communal\nidentity-formation and life-praxes that each proffered with greater or\nless coherence and veracity.\n\n\nMore than a few spokesmen and spokeswomen came forward to\nphilosophize on behalf of their group\u2019s or organization\u2019s\n(or their own) vision for \u2018what was to be done\u2019 to insure\nliberation for Black people, people of\nAfrican descent. (\u201cLiberation\u201d was the watchword\nfor the new agenda; \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201cColored\u201d were\ndenigrated and cast aside, no longer acceptable as terms of racial\nidentification). Politics\u2014and all aspects and dimensions of\nindividual and social life were explicitly politicized\u2014became\ndefined by and focused through the lenses of the substantive symbolics\nof racialized and enculturated Blackness, even as the\nintellectual warriors waging the conceptual and other battles on behalf\nof Blackness struggled to find adequate terms and strategies\nwith which to forge satisfactory and effective articulations of the\npassionately sought and urgently needed new identities as articulations\nof long standing identities and life-agendas were discredited and thus\nrendered inadequate for a significant and influential few. For still a\ngreat many other \u201cNegro?\u201d, \u201cBlack?\u201d,\n\u201cColored?\u201d, \u201cAfrican- American?\u201d,\n\u201cAfrican-descended?\u201d, and \u201cAmerican?\u201d persons there\nwas more than a bit of psychic turmoil and tension, no less of\nconsternation and confusion. And hardly any of these persons, nor even\nmany of the most ardent warriors calling for and/or purveying new\nnotions and definitions of \u201cBlack consciousness\u201d and\n\u201cBlack\u201d agendas for individual and shared lives, knew of\nand had recourse to Alain Locke\u2019s sober and sobering\nwell-reasoned \u201cThe New Negro,\u201d nor the rich resources that\nhad been created by the producers and carriers of the Harlem\nRenaissance. And so the intensified ontologizing philosophizing\nproceeded at near breakneck speed driven largely by a generation of\nyoung adults few of whom had, nor would accept, much in the way of\nintellectual or practical guidance from the experienced and wise of\nprevious generations for whom many of the young and arrogant had too little\nrespect\u2026\n\n\nThe reason, Harold Cruse, a wise and very experienced elder of Left\nand Nationalist organizations and struggles and a formidable thinker in\nhis own right, was careful to point out, was due to a severe and\nconsequential disruption of the passing-on of experience-tested and\nverified knowledge from one generation to another by the ravages of the\nwitch-hunting and persecuting of any and all accused of being a\nCommunist or Communist sympathizer during the crusading campaign led by\nSenator Joseph McCarthy during the 1950s. Many lives and careers were\ndestroyed as a result of McCarthy\u2019s campaign, and many persons\nand organizations with Leftist commitments were either destroyed or\ndriven underground, or otherwise left severely tainted and thus made an\n\u201cuntouchable\u201d bereft of employment, even for one-time\nfriends and close associates. (W.E.B. Du Bois was one who suffered this\nfate, which is largely why he made the momentous decision to renounce\nhis citizenship and leave the United States for residence in Ghana, where\nhe died\u2026) The radical Young Turks, then, not short of courage or\npassion, set out on a mission all but impoverished, in many cases, of\nmuch needed historical and intellectual capital, thus were sometimes poorly\narmed for the battles they sought to wage. Still, the\ntrans-generational disruption that Cruse pointed out was not complete.\nThere were those who filled the gap between the Harlem Renaissance and\nthe rise of the new Black renaissance who would be of\nsignificant influence and guidance, and would serve some in the new movements as personal as well as\nintellectual mentors and role models: Richard Wright, Robert Hayden, Ralph Ellison,\nMargaret Walker, Gwendolyn Brooks, Lorraine Hansberry, and James\nBaldwin, among several others.\n\n\nThere would be much philosophizing born of struggles by the\nnew generation. Much credit has to be given to those who had the\nwherewithal of discipline and fortitude, and good fortune, to survive\nand leave legacies of accomplishment that continue to enrich Black\nfolks, and others. The Black Arts Movement, for example, had profound\nimpacts through the productions and articulations that gave new\ndirections and meanings to artistic creativity, to the agendas guiding\ncreativity and expression and the mission of service to various\naudiences. A manifesto, \u201cTowards a Black Aesthetic,\u201d by\nHoyt Fuller (1923\u20131981; Fuller 1994) and his work as editor of\nthe journal Negro Digest, which later was renamed Black\nWorld and was followed by First World when the publisher\nof the latter was pressured to discontinue publication of a journal\nserving Black radicals, were path-setting ventures during a period\nmuch in need of clear paths. Likewise \u201cThe Black\nAesthetic\u201d by the essayist and theorist Addison Gayle,\nJr. (1932\u20131991), his introduction to an anthology that he edited\nand published bearing the same title (Gayle, Jr. 1972). A collection\nof writings on theory, drama, music, and fiction by many of the\nleading artistic minds in the new Black generation, The Black\nAesthetic has come to be regarded by scholars as \u201cthe\ntheoretical bible of the Black Arts Movement\u201d and thus did for\nthe makers of this Movement what Locke\u2019s The New Negro\nhad done for the makers of the Harlem Renaissance. Both Fuller and\nGayle would play roles similar to Locke\u2019s in serving as midwives\nto the creative and critically-minded development of a sizable portion\nof a generation of seriously radicalized Black\nthinkers-artists.\n\n\nThe new activist thinkers-artists of the 1960s\u2014Nikki Giovanni,\nSonia Sanchez, Amiri Baraka, A.B. Spellman, Larry Neal, Mari Evans,\nHaki R. Madhubuti, and Maulana Karenga, for example\u2014were as\nproductive, formidable, and widely influential as were the New\nNegroes of the 1920s and 1930s, even more so as they exploited the\nadvantages of access to the enabling resources of the media of radio,\ntelevision, and recordings in addition to print media, and to the human\nresources that became available through lecture-circuits on college and\nuniversity campuses. Many of these Black warriors of the intellect and\narts took up positions, some settling into them for the long term, on\nthe faculties of colleges and universities and helped to development\nthe guiding philosophies and wage the political battles that ushered in\nnew programs in Black and African Studies. In so doing they magnified\nthe forcefulness and range of their intellectual and artistic powers\nand contributions, and helped to alter cultural and intellectual scenes\nin the United States and the African Disapora\u2026\n",
