    "main_text": "Enabling positivity: social facts made reasons for action || Basic reasons for action and the need for governmental authority\n1.1 Basic reasons for action and the need for governmental authority\n\n\nIf one thinks perceptively and carefully about what to pursue (or\nshun) and do (or forbear from), one can readily understand and assent\nto practical propositions such as that life and health, knowledge, and\nharmony with other people are desirable for oneself and anyone\nelse. The intrinsic desirability of such states of affairs as one\u2019s\nflourishing in life and health, in knowledge and in friendly relations\nwith others, is articulated in foundational, underived principles of\npractical reasoning (reasoning towards choice and action). Such first\nprinciples of practical reasoning direct one to actions and\ndispositions and arrangements that promote such intelligible goods,\nand that directiveness or normativity is expressed by \u201cI\nshould\u2026\u201d or \u201cI ought\u2026\u201d in senses which\nalthough truly normative are only incipiently moral.\n\n\nA natural law moral theory will give an account of the way in which\nfirst principles of practical reason take on a moral force by being\nconsidered, not one by one but in their united\n(\u201cintegral\u201d) directiveness. That integral directiveness is\ngiven specific (albeit highly general) articulation in principles such\nas the injunction to love one\u2019s neighbor as oneself; or the Golden\nRule of doing for others what you would want them to do for you and\nnot doing to others what you would not have them do to you; or the\n\u201ccategorical imperatives\u201d to respect, and treat as\nintrinsically valuable, humanity (the basic aspects of human\nflourishing) in oneself and in others, so that each of one\u2019s\ncommunities is treated as a kingdom of ends\u2014of persons each\nends in themselves. Such high-level but far from contentless moral\nprinciples can be given further specificity in two ways (1) by\nidentifying what, given some broadly stable features of human reality,\nthey entail (see 1.2\u20134), and (2) by a rational but more or less\nnon-deductive selection among alternative specifications, a selection\nnamed by Aquinas determinatio (plural,\ndeterminationes) (see 1.5). Political communities\nare a kind of institution whose rational status as a normally\ndesirable and obligatory objective of and context for collaborative\naction (and forbearance) can easily be seen to be entailed by the\nfoundational practical and moral principles. In such communities, the\nnormal means for making the needed determinationes is the\ninstitution of governmental authority acting in the first instance\nthrough legislation and other forms of law-making, i.e., acting as a\nsocial-fact source of positive (posited) law.\n\n\nThe political-theoretical part of natural law theory explains and\nelaborates the grounds and proper forms of governmental authority. It\nexplains the similarities and differences between the practical\nauthority of rulers (including democratic electors acting as selectors\nof representatives or as plebiscitary decision-makers) and the\ntheoretical authority of experts and persons of sound judgment. It\nshows the grounds for instituting and accepting practical authority as\nan almost invariably necessary means for preventing forms of harm and\nneglect which, because contrary to the high-level moral principles (at\nleast as they bear on relationships between persons), involve\ninjustice. Political theory subsumes, as one of its branches, legal\ntheory. As legal theory, political theory explains the normal\ndesirability that governmental authority in political communities be\nexercised within the framework of (in the classic slogan) a\n\u201crule of law and not of men\u201d (1.3).\n1.1.1 Why \u201cnatural\u201d law? Naturalistic fallacy?\n\n\nWhat does the mainstream of natural law theory intend by using the\nword \u201cnatural\u201d in that name for the theory?  The shortest\naccurate answer is \u201cof reason,\u201d as in \u201cthe law of\nreason\u201d or \u201cthe requirements of reason.\u201d Aquinas is\nparticularly clear and explicit that in this context,\n\u201cnatural\u201d is predicated of something (say, a law, or a\nvirtue) only when and because that of which it is predicated is in\nline with reason, practical reason, or practical reason\u2019s\nrequirements: see Finnis 1980, 35\u20136. Moreover, he employs,\nthrough all his works, a methodological axiom: X\u2019s nature is\nunderstood by understanding X\u2019s capacities, which are\nunderstood by understanding their act[uation]s, which are understood\nby understanding their objects. But the objects of chosen acts are the\nintelligible intrinsic goods (aspects of human flourishing) which we\nare directed to by practical reason\u2019s first principles.  So the\nequation, in this context, of \u201cnatural\u201d and\n\u201crational\u201d and its cognates is no mere confusion, but\ngrounded in a sophisticated distinction between ontology and\nepistemology: in the order of being, what is good and reasonable for\nus is a resultant of what is foundational, our given nature; but in\nthe order of coming to know, our knowledge of our nature is in\nsignificant part a resultant of our understanding of what kinds of\npossible objects of choice are good.\n\n\nThough the core of classic and mainstream natural law theory is thus\nuntainted by any \u201cnaturalistic fallacy\u201d (Finnis 2018,\n2.4.2), non-practical knowledge of facts counts, in that theory, in\nvarious ways. Knowledge of the factual possibility of (say) acquiring\nknowledge, or of losing or saving life, is a datum (not really a\npremise) for the understanding that such a possibility is also an\nopportunity\u2014that actualizing the possibility would be\ngood for oneself and others. Other kinds of relevant facts\ninclude the facts about certain human radical capacities and their\nabsence in other animals\u2014these facts are the data for the\ninsight into the sense and bounds of the class (persons, human beings)\nof \u201cothers\u201d in \u201cgood for oneself and others.\u201d\nOr again, facts about the limited supply of resources and the limited\nstrength of human will (the need for incentives, etc.) make (1.5)\nappropriation of resources to particular owners a normal requirement\nof justice to non-owners and owners alike.\n",
