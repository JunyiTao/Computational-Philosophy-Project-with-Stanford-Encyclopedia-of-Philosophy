    "main_text": "\n\nMany societies, and nearly all wealthy, developed countries, provide\nuniversal access to a broad range of public health and personal\nmedical services. Is such access to health care a requirement of\nsocial justice, or is it simply a matter of social policy that some\ncountries adopt and others do not? If it is a requirement of social\njustice, we should be clear about what kinds of care we owe people and\nhow we determine what care is owed if we cannot possibly meet every\nhealth need, as arguably no society can. We should be clear about what\nconstitutes appropriate access to that care, given that there are\ndiverse barriers to access. We must also be able to say why we owe\nthese things as a matter of justice, and, of course, different\naccounts of social justice will bake and serve this cake in different\nways.\n\nIn what follows, we shall address these questions in the following\norder. In Section 1, we describe briefly what some societies actually\ndo to assure universal access to health care. Although health care is\nmore equally distributed in these societies than other social goods,\nnevertheless health inequalities persist across demographic groups.\nThis implies a question we shall have to address: if universal access\ncannot assure equality in health status, because there are other\nimportant social determinants of population health and its\ndistribution, then is universal access a requirement of justice after\nall? We shall also examine some of the consequences of unequal access\nto care, for these may compound the effects of inequitable\ndistributions of other determinants of health. In Section 2, we\nexamine more carefully the concept of access to care. How, for\nexample, do we actually tell if access to care is equal or equitable?\nThe problem of measuring access to care aside, we might think that the\nconcept of equal access is straightforwardly analyzed, and the concept\nof equitable access depends in a more complex way on what inequalities\nin access are permissible. We shall see, however, that considerations\nof justice bear on judgments about equal access as well as on those\nabout equitable access. In Section 3, we examine three different lines\nof argument for universal access. In Section 4, we consider what kinds\nof care these views, especially the opportunity-based account, imply\nthat we owe each other. In Section 5, we consider whether we have a\nright to health or health care, in light of those views of justice,\nand what entitlements follow from such a right if there is one.\n",
