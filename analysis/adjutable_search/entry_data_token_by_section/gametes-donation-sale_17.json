Or is incentivising or rewarding providers also\nmorally acceptable?\n\nIn favour of payment, the main reason cited is increased supply, thus\nenabling recipients to have children that they wouldn\u2019t\notherwise have had\u2014or, where scarcity per se is not an\nissue, giving recipients more choice. In addition, supporters of\npayment cite justice (gamete providers deserve to be rewarded) and\nautonomy (providers and recipients should be allowed to contract with\neach other as they see fit). Finally, pragmatic arguments are\nsometimes offered, such as the cost of prohibition or the possibility\nof its leading to an unregulated \u2018black\u2019 or\n\u2018grey\u2019 market in gametes.
