    "main_text": "Objections to Panpsychism || The Subject-Summing Problem\n4.3 The Subject-Summing Problem\nThe kind of mental combination which is generally taken to be most troubling is subject-summing: the combination of distinct conscious subjects into a single conscious mind. And hence the paradigmatic form of the combination problem is the subject-summing problem.\nThe subject-summing problem, and indeed all forms of the combination problem, can be construed in a stronger or a milder form. In its milder form it is taken to be a challenge that the panpsychist must address in the long run, either by eventually coming up with an adequate theoretical account of mental combination, or at least by explaining why such an account is beyond our ken. Almost all panpsychists accept this challenge, and one major activity of the contemporary panpsychism research project is attempting to solve (or circumnavigate) the subject-summing problem and the combination problem more generally.\nIn its stronger form the subject-summing problem takes the form of an argument to the conclusion that subject-summing is incoherent or impossible, and hence that panpsychism\u2014or at least constitutive micropsychism\u2014must be false. Sam Coleman (2014), for example, has argued that subject-summing is incoherent on the grounds that each subject has a viewpoint that excludes the viewpoints of all other subjects. The essence of my current point of view as a conscious subject is a matter not just of the conscious experiences I am positively having, but of the fact that I am having those experiences and no others. The same could be said of the essence of the point of view you are currently enjoying. If my point of view and your point of view were to be combined into an \u201cuber-mind\u201d, then that uber-mind would have to have both your experiences to the exclusion of all other experiences and my experiences to the exclusion of all other experiences. This seems flatly contradictory, assuming that you and I have different experiences. If this argument works, it ought to apply to the much simpler points of view of micro-level subjects, thus rendering constitutive micropsychism incoherent.[24]\nAnother attempt to demonstrate the impossibility of subject-summing is found in Goff\u2019s (2009, 2017) conceivability argument against mental combination. Goff reads into the above James passage a claim about conceivability:\nConceivable Isolation of Subjects (CIS)\u2014For any group of subjects, \\(S_{1}\\), \\(S_{2}\\), \u2026, \\(S_{n}\\), and any conscious states, \\(E_{1}\\), \\(E_{2}\\), \u2026, \\(E_{n}\\), the following scenario is conceivable: there are \\(S_{1}\\), \\(S_{2}\\), \u2026, \\(S_{n}\\) instantiating \\(E_{1}\\), \\(E_{2}\\), \u2026, \\(E_{n}\\), but it\u2019s not the case that there is a subject \\(S^*\\) such that \\(S^*\\) is not identical with any of \\(S_{1}\\), \\(S_{2}\\) \u2026 \\(S_{n}\\).\nBuilding on this he argues that we can conceive of a \u201cmicro-experiential zombie\u201d, defined as a creature that is:\n\nPhysically indiscernible from an actual human being,\nSuch that each of its micro-level parts has conscious experience.\nSuch that no macro-level part of the organism has conscious experience.\n\nIf we can infer from the conceivability to the possibility of such creatures, then the falsity of constitutive micropsychism seems to follow. For the constitutive micropsychist holds that the facts about micro-subjects wholly account for the existence of macro-level conscious subjects. But if it is possible for the facts about micro-subjects to obtain in the absence of any macro-level consciousness\u2014which on the face of it seems to be the case in a world of micro-experiential zombies\u2014then it seems that the facts about micro-subjects cannot wholly account for the existence of macro-level consciousness (it\u2019s generally assumed that for fact X to ground fact Y, it must be the case that X necessitates Y). In that sense, it\u2019s impossible for subjects to sum.\nThis is a particularly worrying argument for the panpsychist, as she generally motivates her view in terms of a rejection of physicalism: if physicalist accounts of consciousness are implausible then this can motivate turning to panpsychism as an alternative. However, the most common way of rejecting physicalism is via a conceivability argument of the above form, roughly: we can conceive of the physical facts of the body and brain obtaining in the absence of the facts about consciousness, and hence the physical facts cannot wholly account for the facts about consciousness (see Chalmers 2009 and Goff 2017). If the same form of argument also applies to the panpsychist account of macro-level consciousness\u2014the kind of consciousness we surely want explained at the end of the day\u2014then it seems we\u2019ve got nowhere. (Note that this worry does not threaten the intrinsic nature argument for panpsychism, discussed above).\nFor further details, see the supplementary document Possible Solutions to the Subject-Summing Problem.\n",
