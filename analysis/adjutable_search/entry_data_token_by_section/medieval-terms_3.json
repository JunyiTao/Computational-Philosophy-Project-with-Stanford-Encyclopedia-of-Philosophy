    "main_text": "Ampliation and Restriction\n4. Ampliation and Restriction\n\nSome words have the effect of widening or narrowing the supposition of\nother terms in a proposition. For example, by qualifying\n\u2018man\u2019 with the adjective \u2018white\u2019, we restrict\nthe supposition of \u2018man\u2019 in \u2018A white man is\nrunning\u2019 to white men; while a verb in the past tense ampliates\nthe supposition of the subject to include what were its supposita. For\nexample, \u2018A white thing was black\u2019 means that something\nwhich is now white or was white in the past was black.\n\nLambert of Auxerre is typical in describing the many aspects of a\nproposition which can produce ampliation or restriction. Some are\nnatural, as when \u2018rational\u2019 restricts \u2018animal\u2019\nto supposit only for men by being adjoined to it; other cases are\n\u2018usualis\u2019 \u2013 \u2018use-governed\u2019 in\nMaloney\u2019s translation (p. 278): for example, when we say\n\u2018The king [or better \u2018A king\u2019 (rex)] is\ncoming\u2019, we are taken to mean the king of the country where we\nare, so \u2018king\u2019 is restricted to supposit only for that\nking. Some ampliation and restriction is effected by consignification,\nthat is, by an aspect of a word \u2013 by the tense of the verb, or\nby the gender of an adjective: in \u2018homo alba\u2019, the\nfeminine ending of \u2018alba\u2019 restricts \u2018homo\u2019 to\nsupposit only for women, indeed, white women. Other ampliation and\nrestriction is effected by the signification of words \u2013 as in\nthe case of \u2018rational animal\u2019 just mentioned, or in\n\u201cSocrates\u2019 donkey\u201d, where the possessive restricts\n\u2018donkey\u2019 to supposit only for Socrates\u2019 donkeys.\n\nPeter of Spain (ed. Copenhaver, p. 441) notes that only general terms\ncan be ampliated or restricted, and only terms having personal\nsupposition.\n\nJust as the past tense ampliates the subject to include past as well\nas present supposita, modal verbs ampliate the subject to possible\nsupposita, as do verbs such as \u2018understand\u2019,\n\u2018believe\u2019, and indeed, notes Albert of Saxony, verbal\nnouns ending in \u2018-bile\u2019: \u2018possible\u2019,\n\u2018audible\u2019, \u2018credible\u2019, \u2018capable of\nlaughter\u2019 and so on. Albert (Perutilis Logica II 11,\ned. Berger, p. 380) realises that even \u2018supposit\u2019\nampliates the subject: when we say \u2018This term supposits for\nsomething\u2019, what it supposits for need not actually exist, but\nmight be past, future, possible or merely intelligible. According to\nBuridan, \u2018must\u2019 ampliates for possible supposita, for\n\u2018A must be B\u2019 means \u2018It is not\npossible that A not be B\u2019, contradictories\nmust clearly ampliate in the same way, and \u2018It is possible that\nA not be B\u2019 ampliates for possibilia.\nAmpliation over possibles means care is needed in inferences from\n\u2018is\u2019 to \u2018can\u2019: \u2018A can be\nB\u2019 need not follow from \u2018A is\nB\u2019, for \u2018A can be B\u2019\nmeans that what is or can be A can be B, and even if\nA is B, not everything which can be A might\nbe capable of being B. For example, \u2018Every planet\nlighting our hemisphere can be the sun\u2019 is false even though it\nis in fact the sun which lights it, since the moon might light our\nhemisphere but the moon cannot be the\n sun.[30]\n\nIt is an interesting fact that almost alone among terminist logicians,\nOckham does not speak of ampliation and restriction. (See Priest and\nRead 1981.) The reason appears to be that he disagrees with the\ntruth-condition given above for \u2018A white thing was black\u2019,\nand similar cases. This proposition, he says, is ambiguous. Rather\nthan meaning that what is or was white was black, it equivocates\nbetween \u2018What is white was black\u2019 and \u2018What was\nblack was white\u2019: \u201cin the case of every proposition of the\npast and of the future in which the subject is a general term or a\ndemonstrative pronoun with a general term or a discrete term referring\nto some composite, we must distinguish [two\n senses]\u201d.[31]\n Whether Ockham realized that his theory improved on the ampliative\ntheory is unclear; nonetheless, his account seems to accord better\nwith intuition. For the ampliative account is disjunctive: it says\nthat the proposition is true if either what was white was black or\nwhat is white was black. Then it is true if either disjunct is true;\nwhereas on Ockham\u2019s account it has two different senses, and can\nbe false on one while true on the other \u2013 true because something\nnow white used to be black but false if nothing which used to be white\nwas ever black. For a clearer case, take the first sex-change\noperation \u2013 for the first time, say, a woman was a man. But no\none who was a woman had ever been a man, so it was (also) false that a\nwoman was a man. The proposition \u2018A woman was a man\u2019 is\nambiguous and \u201cest distinguenda \u201d (i.e.,\ndifferent senses must be distinguished, one true, one false).\n\nOckham also eschews talk of ampliation in giving his account of modal\npropositions. Does \u2018A white thing can be black\u2019 mean that\nwhat is or can be white can be black, i.e., that either what is white\ncan be black or what can be white can be black, as the ampliative\naccount demands? \u2013 cf., e.g., Albert of Saxony: \u201cFor\n\u2018A white thing can be black\u2019 signifies that what is white\nor what can be white can be black\u201d (my\n translation).[32]\n No, for this loses the sense in which it is self-contradictory to\nsuggest that it is possible that a white thing be black. The\nproposition is ambiguous, in one sense self-contradictory, in the\nother true, Ockham notes (Summa Logicae II 10), because\n\u2018This is black\u2019 can be true if uttered pointing to\nsomething white: \u201c\u2018A white thing can be black\u2019 is\ntrue, because \u2018This is black\u2019 is possible, pointing to\nsomething for which \u2018white\u2019 supposits; but \u2018A white\nthing is black\u2019 is\n impossible\u201d.[33]\n",
