    "main_text": "Location || The Pure Logic of Location\n2.2 The Pure Logic of Location\n\nMost of the formal work on location has focused on questions about how\nlocation interacts with parthood. But there are important questions\nabout location in its own right. Here we highlight two groups of\nquestions.\n2.2.1 Logical Form\n\nWe will assume that exact location, not weak location, is the unique,\nfundamental location relation. We will also assume that (i) it is a\ntwo-place relation, and (ii) both argument places in that relation are\nsingular. (On the distinction between singular and plural argument\nplaces in relations, see Yi (1999).) But both (i) and (ii) have been\nquestioned.\n\nFor example, one might reject (i) in favor of the view that exact\nlocation is a three-place relation that holds between a located\nentity, a region of space, and an instant of time (Thomson 1983, Costa\n2017). This is a natural view for those who accept Eternalism and the\nB-theory but deny the Spacetime View, and instead think of space as a\nthree-dimensional entity that endures through, and is separate from,\ntime. (This picture is discussed in Skow 2015 and Gilmore, Costa and\nCalosi 2016.) To allow for the possibility of motion, those who\nendorse such a view will want to be able to say, of a given material\nobject, that it is exactly located at region r1, not\nat region r2, at time t1, and that\nthe same object is exactly located at r2, not at\nr1, at time t2. To allow for the\npossibility that time is gunky and does not contain instants, one\nmight take exact location to be expressed by \u2018x is\nexactly located at region r within interval s\u2019. A\ndifferent option is to reject (i) in favor of the view that exact\nlocation is variably polyadic, an idea floated by Jones (forthcoming:\nnote 29).\n\nAlternatively, one might agree that exact location is a two-place\nrelation but reject (ii) above in favor of the view that, say, the\nsecond argument place in exact location (the \u2018location\u2019\nslot) is plural. One idea is that an extended object can be exactly\nlocated at many points, collectively, without being exactly located at\nany one of them individually or at the set or fusion of them. This is\nsuggested by Hudson (2005: 17); motivations are developed in Gilmore\n(2014b: 25). In principle, one could also hold that the first argument\nplace in exact location (the \u2018occupant\u2019 slot) is\nplural.\n2.2.2 Purely Locational Principles\n\nIf we assume that exact location is the one fundamental locational\nrelation, that it's two-place, and that both of its argument places\nare singular, what should we say about its behavior? Here we confine\nour attention to purely locational principles, i.e., principles that\ncan be stated in a first-order language with identity whose only\nnon-logical predicate is \u2018L(x,\ny)\u2019.\n\nCasati and Varzi (1999: 121) propose two principles:\n\n Functionality\n\u2200x\u2200y\u2200z[(L(x,\ny) & L(x, z)) \u2192\ny=z]\n\nNothing has more than one exact location.\n Conditional Reflexivity\n\u2200x\u2200y[L(x, y) \u2192\nL(y, y)]\n\nExact locations are exactly located at themselves.\n\n\nFunctionality bans multilocation, which we discuss at some length in\nSection 6. It tells us that nothing bears the exact location relation\nto more than one entity. Functionality leaves open the possibility of\nentities (regions, numbers, \u2026) that do not bear that relation\nto anything.\n\nAccording to Conditional Reflexivity, exact locations are exactly\nlocated at themselves. (See also Donnelly (2004: 158), who presents a\nsystem in which Conditional Reflexivity is a theorem, though she\nreplaces the location predicate \u2018L\u2019 with a\nprimitive function symbol \u2018r\u2019 for \u2018the exact\nlocation of\u2019.) To appreciate the significance of Conditional\nReflexivity, suppose that Obama is exactly located at region r.\nTogether with Conditional Reflexivity, this entails that r is\nexactly located at itself. This conflicts with a purely locational\nprinciple endorsed by Simons (2004b: 345):\n\n Asymmetry of Location\n\u2200x\u2200y[(L(x, y) \u2192\n\u00acL(y, x)]\n\nIf x is exactly located at y then y is not\nexactly located at x.\n\n\nCases in which a region is exactly located at itself do not conflict\nwith\n\n Antisymmetry of Location\n\u2200x\u2200y[(L(x, y) &\nL(y, x)) \u2192 x=y]\n\nNo two entities are exactly located at each other.\n\n\nThus the Antisymmetry of Location may salvage some of the motivation\nfor the Asymmetry of Location while still harmonizing with Conditional\nReflexivity. The Antisymmetry of Location is a logical consequence of\nFunctionality and Conditional Reflexivity (as is the view that exact\nlocation is transitive).\n\nIf we further assume that Obama is not identical to his exact location\nr, we get the result that there are two different entities\nexactly located at r\u2014namely, r and Obama. In that\ncase, we have a counterexample to another purely locational principle\nthat some have found attractive, namely:\n\n Injectivity of Location\n\u2200x\u2200y\u2200z[(L(x,\nz) & L(y, z)) \u2192\nx=y]\n\nNo two entities share an exact location.\n\n\nOpponents of co-location may take this as a reductio of\nConditional Reflexivity. Others may take it as a reason to reject the\nInjectivity of Location in favor of a weaker variant, e.g.:\n\n Conditional Injectivity of\nLocation\n\u2200x\u2200y\u2200z[(\u00acx=z\n& \u00acy=z) \u2192 ((L(x, z)\n& L(y, z)) \u2192 x=y)]\n\nIf neither x nor y is identical to z, then if each of them is\nexactly located at z, then x and y are identical to each\nother.\n\n\nConditional Injectivity is equivalent to the claim that whenever two\ndifferent entities share a given exact location, one of them is\nidentical to that location. This may salvage some of the motivation\nfor the ban on co-location, while still harmonizing with Conditional\nReflexivity.\n\nWith Conditional Reflexivity as a backdrop, Casati and Varzi (1999:\n123) define a predicate for regionhood, \u2018R\u2019:\n\n(DR)\n Regionhood R(x)\n=df L(x, x)\n\n\u2018x is a region\u2019 means the same as \u2018x\nis exactly located at itself\u2019\n\n\nTogether with Conditional Reflexivity, (DR) entails that that if\nx is exactly located at y, then y is exactly\nlocated at itself and hence is a region. But the (DR) + Conditional\nReflexivity package also allows for cases in which an entity r\ncounts as a region even though nothing but r is exactly located\nat r.\n\nThe regionhood predicate is potentially useful in stating restricted\nversions of familiar mereological principles. One might want a\nprinciple to the effect that any plurality of regions has a\nfusion, while remaining neutral on the more general claim that any\nplurality of entities whatever has a fusion. Likewise one might want a\nprinciple to the effect that non-identical regions never\nmereologically coincide, while rejecting the stronger claim that\nnon-identical entities in general never mereologically coincide.\n(Perhaps a certain clay statue mereologically coincides with, but is\nnot identical to, a certain lump of clay.) The most natural\nformulations of these restricted principles employ a regionhood\npredicate. Though one might take this predicate as primitive,\nconsiderations of ideological parsimony provide some motivation for\ntreating it as defined.\n\nTo close this section, it is worth drawing attention to another\nlogical consequence of Functionality and Conditional Reflexivity,\nnamely:\n\n Shortness of Location\n\u2200x\u2200y\u2200z[(L(x,\ny) & L(y, z)) \u2192\ny=z]\n\nIf x is exactly located at y and y is exactly located at z, then\ny=z.\n\n\nThis says that exact locations are exactly located only at themselves\n(hence that \u2018chains\u2019 of exact location are always\n\u2018short\u2019). To see why this follows from Functionality and\nConditional Reflexivity, suppose that x is exactly located at\ny. Then by Conditional Reflexivity, y is exactly located\nat y. If y is also exactly located at z, then by\nFunctionality, y=z.\n\nShortness of Location might also appeal to those who accept\nConditional Reflexivity but deny Functionality. Since Shortness of\nLocation does not follow from Conditional Reflexivity alone, some may\nwish to adopt Shortness as an axiom.\n",
