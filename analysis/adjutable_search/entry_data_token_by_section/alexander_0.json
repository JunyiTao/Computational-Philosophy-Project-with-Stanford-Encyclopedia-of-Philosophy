    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nAlexander was born in Sydney on 6 January 1859, to a Jewish family. He\nwas the third son of Samuel Alexander, a British emigrant and saddler.\nAlexander\u2019s father died a few weeks after his birth, and five\nyears later the remaining family moved to Melbourne. Alexander was\nhome-educated by tutors before entering Wesley College in 1871.\nAlexander entered the University of Melbourne in 1875, and\nsubsequently won awards in arts, sciences, languages and natural\nphilosophy. In 1877, Alexander sailed for England, in an attempt to\nwin a scholarship at Oxbridge. He successfully obtained a scholarship\nat Balliol College, Oxford, and went on to win a First in 1881. The\nfollowing year, Alexander was awarded a Fellowship at Lincoln College,\nOxford.\n\nAt this time, the Oxford philosophical scene was dominated by British\nidealism, and Alexander formed lifelong ties with the Absolute\nidealists F. H. Bradley, A. C. Bradley, and Bernard Bosanquet. This\nidealist influence is evident in Alexander\u2019s earliest works, on\nHegel and moral progress. Arguably, it is also evident in his later\nworks on metaphysics too. As a student, Alexander also read\nPlato\u2014under the tutelage of the idealist Benjamin\nJowett\u2014and Hegel.\n\nAlthough Alexander remained largely UK-based, in 1882\nhe travelled to Germany for a year, spending at least some of\nthis time at the University of Berlin, where he became familiar with\nthe physiological psychology of Hermann von Helmholtz. In 1890 he\ntravelled to Freiburg, Germany, to spend roughly another year working\nin Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg\u2019s new psychological laboratory.\n\nIn 1893, Alexander accepted a Professorship at the University of\nManchester. He took an active part in the university life there, and\nstrongly supported feminism. Alexander remained at Manchester for the\nrest of his life, and in 1902 he brought various family members\nover\u2014including his mother and three of his siblings\u2014from\nAustralia to Manchester. He did not marry. Although Alexander never\nreturned to Australia he maintained a correspondence with several\nAustralian philosophers, including the Scottish-born John\nAnderson.\n\nAs Alexander developed his anti-idealist views, he published on\nnaturalism and realism. He corresponded at length with fellow British\nemergentists C. Lloyd Morgan and C. D. Broad on psychology and\nmetaphysics. Whilst he rejected idealism, he also continued to\ncorrespond with F. H. Bradley and Bosanquet. During the War, Alexander\ncanvassed for recruits, and assisted Belgian refugees.\n\nInterest in Alexander\u2019s work grew as he became President of\nthe Aristotelian Society from 1908\u20131911 (he\nbecame President again, from 1936\u20131937). He was invited to\ndeliver the Gifford lectures during the war years 1917 and 1918.\nThese were called \u2018Space, time, and deity\u2019 and would form the basis of\nhis (1920) Space, Time, and Deity. Laird reports\nthat, after the war, Alexander struggled with writing its two volumes:\n\u201cHe was overwhelmed by a sense of his littleness in comparison\nwith the task to which he was tied\u201d (Laird 1939: 61).\nNonetheless, Space, Time, and Deity was finally\nfinished, assuring Alexander\u2019s place within the British philosophical\nlandscape. It was praised by new realists and idealists alike. As\nJohn Passmore puts it:\n\n\n\u2026even when he [Alexander] broke with the Idealists, they\ncontinued to speak of him with a respect they rarely showed to the New\nRealists\u2014although this charity did not survive the bleakness of\nCambridge, where McTaggart, forgetting his own blackened pots,\ncomplained of Space, Time, and Deity that \u201cin every\nchapter we come across some view which no philosopher, except\nProfessor Alexander, has ever maintained\u201d. It would be inhuman\nto expect the arch-enemy of Time to praise its arch-prophet. (Passmore\n1957: 268)\n\n\nBleakness of Cambridge aside, Alexander received many honours during\nhis lifetime. These include his election as a Fellow of the British\nAcademy in 1913, an honorary D.Litt from Oxford in 1924, an honorary\nLitt.D from the University of Liverpool in 1925, and another from the\nUniversity of Cambridge in 1934. In 1923, Alexander retired from\nManchester. In a speech, he described how proud and happy he was\nduring his time as a professor there, \u201cduring which I tried to\ndo my part\u201d (Alexander, cited in Laird 1939: 71).\n\nAlexander\u2019s retirement did not stem the tide of his output.\nHaving completed Space, Time, and Deity, Alexander continued\nto produce a stream of articles as prolific as it was diverse. He\nwrote several pieces comparing his metaphysics to that of Spinoza, and\nAlexander took pride\u2014rooted partly in their shared Jewish\nheritage\u2014in the deep similarity he perceived there. Alexander\nalso wrote on the nature of art, history, Moliere, Pascal, theology,\nand Jane Austen. Alexander was a lifelong fan of Austen, and\nparticularly loved Persuasion. His friend and colleague, J.\nH. Muirhead, suggested that Alexander\u2019s love of literature may\nhave resulted from partial deafness, which made it difficult for\nhim to appreciate music.\n\nUltimately, Alexander turned his philosophic attention away from\nmetaphysics to art and value. Lord Listowel describes\nAlexander\u2019s move towards aesthetics:\n\n\nBut why, of the many unsailed seas he must have been tempted to chart,\ndid his insatiable curiosity launch him on a last voyage into the\nrough waters of aesthetic theory? There is no certain answer to this\nquestion. What we do know is that the third person of the hallowed\ntrinity whose members are Truth, Goodness, and Beauty had hitherto\nbeen sadly neglected as compared with the first two, and that a\ntreatise on aesthetics was urgently required as the coping stone of a\nneatly finished philosophical system. Yet it would be a grievous error\nto suppose that his fondness for the subject was due solely or even\nmainly to systematic grounds. Art, in its manifold shapes, attracted\nhim irresistibly\u2026 [he] wrote and talked about Art because he\nreally loved the pictures, statues, mansions, poems, novels, and plays\nthat are its concrete manifestations. (Listowel 1939: 181)\n\n\nAlexander\u2019s full system of aesthetics can be found in his final\nmonograph, Beauty and Other Forms of Value (1933).\n\nIn his late years, Alexander continued to publish, but Laird reports\nthat Alexander was greatly troubled from the 1930s by the suffering of\nJewish refugees; Alexander did all he could to help with pen and purse\n(Laird 1939: 94). Alexander died on 13 September 1938, and his ashes\nlie in the Manchester Southern Cemetery. He bequeathed the majority of\nhis estate, and his philosophical papers, to the University of\nManchester. A bust of Alexander, by the artist Epstein, stands in the\nUniversity of Manchester\u2019s Samuel Alexander Building (formerly\nknown as the Hall of the Arts Building). Alexander reportedly said\nthat he would be happy to have Erravit cum Spinoza engraved\non his funeral urn; Muirhead suggested that instead he should have\nUt alter Spinoza\n philosophatus[1]\n (Muirhead 1939: 14).\n\nA biography of Alexander can be found in Laird\u2019s (1939) memoir;\nsee also Muirhead (1939) and G. F. Stout (1940). \n",
