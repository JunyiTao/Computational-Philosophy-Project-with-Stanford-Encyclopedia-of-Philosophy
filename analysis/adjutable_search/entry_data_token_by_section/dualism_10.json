    "main_text": "Arguments for Dualism || The Argument from Predicate Dualism to Property Dualism\n4.2 The Argument from Predicate Dualism to Property Dualism\n\n\nI said above that predicate dualism might seem to have no\nontological consequences, because it is concerned only with the\ndifferent way things can be described within the contexts of the\ndifferent sciences, not with any real difference in the things\nthemselves. This, however, can be disputed.\n\n\nThe argument from predicate to property dualism moves in two steps,\nboth controversial. The first claims that the irreducible special\nsciences, which are the sources of irreducible predicates, are not\nwholly objective in the way that physics is, but depend for their\nsubject matter upon interest-relative perspectives on the world. This\nmeans that they, and the predicates special to them, depend on the\nexistence of minds and mental states, for only minds have\ninterest-relative perspectives. The second claim is that \npsychology \u2013 the science of the mental \u2013 is itself an irreducible\nspecial science, and so it, too, presupposes the existence of the\nmental. Mental predicates therefore presuppose the mentality that\ncreates them: mentality cannot consist simply in the applicability of\nthe predicates themselves.\n\n\nFirst, let us consider the claim that the special sciences are not\nfully objective, but are interest-relative.\n\n\nNo-one would deny, of course, that the very same subject matter or\n\u2018hunk of reality\u2019 can be described in irreducibly different\nways and it still be just that subject matter or piece of reality. A\nmass of matter could be characterized as a hurricane, or as a\ncollection of chemical elements, or as mass of sub-atomic particles,\nand there be only the one mass of matter. But such different\nexplanatory frameworks seem to presuppose different perspectives on\nthat subject matter.\n\n\nThis is where basic physics, and perhaps those sciences reducible to\nbasic physics, differ from irreducible special sciences. On a realist\nconstrual, the completed physics cuts physical reality up at its\nultimate joints: any special science which is nomically strictly\nreducible to physics also, in virtue of this reduction, it could be\nargued, cuts reality at its joints, but not at its minutest ones. If\nscientific realism is true, a completed physics will tell one how the\nworld is, independently of any special interest or concern: it is just\nhow the world is. It would seem that, by contrast, a science\nwhich is not nomically reducible to physics does not take its\nlegitimation from the underlying reality in this direct way. Rather,\nsuch a science is formed from the collaboration between, on the one\nhand, objective similarities in the world and, on the other,\nperspectives and interests of those who devise the science. The concept\nof hurricane is brought to bear from the perspective of creatures\nconcerned about the weather. Creatures totally indifferent to the\nweather would have no reason to take the real patterns of phenomena\nthat hurricanes share as constituting a single kind of thing. With the\nirreducible special sciences, there is an issue of salience ,\nwhich involves a subjective component: a selection of\nphenomena with a certain teleology in mind is required before\ntheir structures or patterns are reified. The entities of metereology\nor biology are, in this respect, rather like Gestalt\nphenomena.\n\n\nEven accepting this, why might it be thought that the\nperspectivality of the special sciences leads to a genuine property\ndualism in the philosophy of mind? It might seem to do so for the\nfollowing reason. Having a perspective on the world, perceptual or\nintellectual, is a psychological state. So the irreducible special\nsciences presuppose the existence of mind. If one is to avoid an\nontological dualism, the mind that has this perspective must be part of\nthe physical reality on which it has its perspective. But psychology,\nit seems to be almost universally agreed, is one of those special\nsciences that is not reducible to physics, so if its subject matter is\nto be physical, it itself presupposes a perspective and, hence, the\nexistence of a mind to see matter as psychological. If this\nmind is physical and irreducible, it presupposes mind to see it as\nsuch. We seem to be in a vicious circle or regress.\n\n\nWe can now understand the motivation for full-blown reduction. A\ntrue basic physics represents the world as it is in itself, and if the\nspecial sciences were reducible, then the existence of their ontologies\nwould make sense as expressions of the physical, not just as ways of\nseeing or interpreting it. They could be understood \u2018from the\nbottom up\u2019, not from top down. The irreducibility of the special\nsciences creates no problem for the dualist, who sees the explanatory\nendeavor of the physical sciences as something carried on from a\nperspective conceptually outside of the physical world. Nor need this\nworry a physicalist, if he can reduce psychology, for then he\ncould understand \u2018from the bottom up\u2019 the acts (with their\ninternal, intentional contents) which created the irreducible\nontologies of the other sciences. But psychology is one of the least\nlikely of sciences to be reduced. If psychology cannot be reduced, this\nline of reasoning leads to real emergence for mental acts and hence to\na real dualism for the properties those acts instantiate (Robinson\n2003).\n",
