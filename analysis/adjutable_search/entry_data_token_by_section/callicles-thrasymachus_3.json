    "main_text": "Socrates vs. Callicles\n5. Socrates vs. Callicles\n\nThe most fundamental difficulty with Callicles\u2019 position is\nbrought out by Socrates\u2019 final refutation at 497d\u2013499b. This is\na simple and elegant argument which brings into collision\nCallicles\u2019 hedonism and his account of the virtues, roughly as\nfollows: (1) pleasure is the good; (2) good people are good by the\npresence of good things; (3) good people are the virtuous, i.e., the\nintelligent and courageous; (4) the foolish and cowardly sometimes\nexperience as much pleasure as the intelligent and courageous, or even\nmore; (5) therefore, bad people are sometimes as good as good ones, or\neven better. Here, premises (1) and (3) represent Callicles\u2019\nhedonism and his account of the virtues respectively; (2) and (4) seem\nundeniable; but (1), (2), and (4) together entail (5), which conflicts\nwith (3) and is anyway a contradiction in terms.\n\nThe problem is obvious: one cannot consistently claim both that\npleasure is the good, and that courage and intelligence\n(which are manifestly not instances of pleasure, or derivative of it,\nor even reliably correlated with it) are goods. Callicles\ncould perhaps respond that the virtues are instrumentally good: an\nintelligent and courageous person is \u2018good\u2019 in the\nindirect sense that he is, overall and in the long run, more apt than\nothers to obtain the good of pleasure. But this is not a very\nplausible claim\u2014least of all in the warfare-ridden world of\nthe Greek polis, where the coward might be at a significant\nadvantage for survival. And this \u2018instrumentalist\u2019 option\nwould in any case be false to Callicles\u2019 spirit. His praise of\nthe virtues of the superior man expresses a hazy but genuine spirit of\nadmiration (like Thrasymachus with his \u2018real ruler\u2019),\nrather than a calculation of instrumental utility. So Callicles is\ngenuinely torn. He is urging Socrates and us to pursue two ends which\nare not only different but sometimes incompatible: pleasure and the\nvirtues as he understands them. Rather oddly, this is perhaps the\nfirst clear formulation of what will later be a central contrast in\nmore standard philosophical ethical systems: the two ends represented\nby \u2018inclination\u2019 and \u2018duty\u2019 (Kant), or the\n\u2018dualism of practical reason\u2019 (Sidgwick). And the case of\nCallicles can help us to see an important point often obscured in\nlater versions, which is that some conflict along these lines can\narise even if one\u2019s conception of virtue has nothing to do with\naltruism. Even for an immoralist, there is room for a clash between\nthe ends set by self-interested desire and those derived from other,\ndisinterested origins (admiration of one\u2019s heroes, for \ninstance)\u2014between the advantages it is rational for us to pursue and the\nsort of person we ought to try to be. \n\nLike his praise of the justice of nature, Callicles\u2019\nnon-instrumental attachment to the virtues of his superior man raises\nthe question whether \u2018immoralist\u2019 is really the right term\nfor him. He resembles his fan Nietzsche in being a shape-shifter: at\nsome points he seems to attack the legitimacy of moral norms as such,\nbut at others he offers what looks like his own morality, one indeed\nwhich is much less new and radical than he seems to want us to think.\nIf we do want to retain the term \u2018immoralist\u2019 for him, we\nneed to allow that the basic immoralist challenge (that is, why be\njust? or why be moral?) may be raised from two rather different\nperspectives. Rather than being someone who disputes the rational\nauthority of ethical norms as such, as Thrasymachus seems to do, the\nimmoralist may be someone who has his own set of ethical norms and\nideals, ones which exclude ordinary morality. \n\nCallicles himself does not seem to realize how deep the problems with\nhis position go. He responds to Socrates\u2019 refutations by making\na rather shrug-like suggestion that (contrary to his earlier explicit\ninsistence) some pleasures are of course better than others (499b). In\nthe end, Callicles\u2019 position is perhaps best seen as a series of\nshifting suggestions or impulses\u2014against conventional\njustice, against temperance, for the Homeric\nself-assertion of the strong, for pleasures and psychological\nintensity\u2014rather than a coherent set of philosophical theses.\nThe disunified quality of Callicles\u2019 thought may actually be the\nkey to its perpetual power: almost all readers find something to tempt\nthem here, and are easily left with the lurking sense that the\n\u2018real\u2019 Calliclean position, whatever we might prefer it to\nbe, remains unrefuted. (And indeed of the four ingredients of\nCallicles\u2019 position discussed above, Socrates\u2019 arguments\ntarget only (3) and (4): whether (1) and (2) could be reconceived on\nsome lines not reliant on them is an open question.) This unease is\nstrengthened by a fifth component of Callicles\u2019 position: his\nattack on the value of philosophy itself. It is a prominent theme of\nCallicles\u2019 opening rants that philosophy, while a valuable part\nof liberal education, is unworthy and a waste of time for a serious\nadult (485e\u2013486d). The life of philosophy is unmanly and immature, the\nantithesis of an honorable public life; Socrates ought to \u2018stop\nthis refuting\u2019 and \u2018leave these subtleties to\nothers\u2019. Callicles\u2019 anti-intellectualism does not prevent\nhim from showing some skill in dialectic, and more commitment to its\nnorms than most of Socrates\u2019 interlocutors (e.g., at 495a). But\nCallicles also claims that he argues only to please Gorgias (506c);\nand in the end, he opts out of the discussion altogether, retreating\ninto surly silence. What makes this rejection of philosophical\ndialectic disturbing is Callicles\u2019 suggestion that\nSocrates\u2019 philosophical positions are just self-serving\nexpressions of his commitment to his own way of life\u2014a version\nof the plausible ancient Greek truism that each man naturally praises\nhis own way of life as best. According to Callicles, this means that\nSocrates would have to change his practices to gain insight:\n\u201cThis is the truth of the matter, as you will know if you\nabandon philosophy and move on to more important things\u201d (484c).\nCallicles is here the first voice within philosophy to raise the\nprospect that there are truths which philosophy itself may hide from\nus. That is a possibility which Socrates clearly rejects; but it is\nhard to see how he could refute it.\n",
