    "main_text": "Nonidentity Cases\n2. Nonidentity Cases\n\nAs just noted, many nonidentity cases that have been most persuasive\non the point that some bad acts are bad\nfor no existing or future person involve acts that do not on\ntheir face seem to have anything to do with whether one person is\nbrought into existence rather than another. They involve acts, that\nis, to which no particular person seems to \u201cowe\u201d his or\nher \u201cvery existence.\u201d\n\nThat ordinary acts might have such an existence-inducing nature\n\u2013 that the people they bring into flawed existences would not,\nindeed, could not have ever existed at all in the absence of\nthose acts \u2013 is related to the phenomenon Gregory Kavka\ndescribed as the \u201cprecariousness\u201d of existence (Kavka\n1982, 93). We understand that the identity of each person who ever\ncomes into existence \u2013 the coming into existence, that is, of\nany one particular person in place of any nonidentical distinct person\n\u2013 depends, among other things, on just who the genetic parents\nof that person happen to be. As Parfit observes, the woman who wonders\nwho she would have been had her \u201cparents married other\npeople\u201d \u201cignores the answer,\u201d which is \u201cno\none\u201d (Parfit 1987, 351). But it is not just whom one procreates\nwith that determines the identity of one\u2019s offspring. It is also\nwhat Parfit described as the \u201ctiming and manner\u201d of\nconception. When the act of conceiving a child is moved forward or\nbackward in time by months or even moments, or when the manner of\nconception is itself altered (accomplished, e.g., via in vitro\nfertilization rather than coitus), the result, very probably, will be\nthe conception of a distinct child altogether. After all, any\ndifference in timing or manner of conception very probably will place\na distinct inseminating sperm cell (out of hundreds of millions!) in\nproximity to the ovum or even result in a distinct ovum being\ninseminated. And a distinction in sperm and egg cells would seem in\nmost cases sufficient to insure the conception of a distinct child\n(Parfit 1987, 351\u201355; 2011 vol. 2, 217\u2013231). Moreover, the\nexact timing and manner of conception is itself highly susceptible to\nvariations in whatever complex chain of acts and events it is that has\ncome before. Much of what has been done in human history, had it been\ndone differently, would surely have undone the conceptions of vast\nnumbers of people. \u201c[H]ow many of us could truly claim,\n\u2018Even if railways and motor cars had never been invented, I\nwould still have been born\u2019?\u201d (Parfit 1987, 361).\n\nConsider, then, an act A that is performed at a possible\nworld w and yields at w positive but low wellbeing\nlevels for one or more people who will but do not yet exist at\nw. Suppose that wellbeing levels are low in virtue of the\nfact that act A performed at w causes those people\nto endure pain, misery, disease, deprivation or limitation. And\nsuppose that those low wellbeing levels cannot be justified (on the\nground, for example, that they save many existing people from still\nlower wellbeing levels) and that we are accordingly convinced that act\nA is wrong. Kavka\u2019s precariousness-of-existence point\ntells us that in many such cases the very future people \u2013 call\nthem the \u201cA-people\u201d \u2013 who endure low wellbeing\nlevels also \u201cowe their very existence\u201d to that act\nA. Perhaps an act B existed as an alternative for\nthe agents at the time just prior to choice. And perhaps B\nstrikes us as more benign than A in the sense that B\nwould have yielded higher wellbeing levels for whatever future people\nmay happen to have existed had B been performed in place of\nA. The problem is that in many cases \u2013 and it takes\njust one to produce the relevant problem case, the counterexample\nagainst the person-based intuition \u2013 performing B in\nplace of A would also have changed (or very probably would\nhave changed) the timing and manner of the conceptions that take place\nat w. That means that act B would not have made\nthings better for the A-people but rather would have caused the\nA-people \u2013 each and every one of them \u2013 to have (very\nprobably) been left out of existence altogether. The pain, misery and\nso on that A imposes on the A-people is, in other words,\nunavoidable if those particular people are ever to exist at\nall. The same point holds for any other seemingly more benign act as\nwell. Assuming that the A-people are not so miserable that never\nexisting at all would have been better for them than their existence\nin w in fact is, we now find it very hard to see how\nA has harmed, or made things worse for, or been bad\nfor, the A-people in any \u201cmorally relevant way\u201d\n(Parfit 1987, 361\u201363, 374).\n",
