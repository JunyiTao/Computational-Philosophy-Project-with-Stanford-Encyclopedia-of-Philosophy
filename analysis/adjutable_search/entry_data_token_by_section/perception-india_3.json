    "main_text": "Perspectives on Perception || Ny\u0101ya realism\n2.2 Ny\u0101ya realism\n\nThe most comprehensive, and the most influential, definition of\nperception in classical Indian philosophy is offered in\nGautama\u2019s Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.4:\n\nPerception is a cognition which arises from the contact of the sense\norgan and object and is not impregnated by words, is unerring, and\nwell-ascertained.\n\n\nExpectedly, each part of this definition has raised controversy and\ncriticism. If perception is a cognition (and non-erroneous), then it\nis a state of knowledge, rather than a means to knowing! How does that\nconstitute a primary means of knowledge? Some Naiy\u0101yika\ncommentators, V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra (c. 900\u2013980 CE) and\nJayanta Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (c. 9th century CE) among them, suggest\nthat the s\u016btra is to be understood by adding to it the\nterm \u2018from which (yatah\u0323),\u2019 since the\npreceding s\u016btra-s indicates that Gautama\u2019s\nformulation of this s\u016btra was intended to define an\ninstrument of knowledge. Another issue has been the interpretation of\nthe word \u2018contact\u2019. In what sense are the eye and the ear,\nthe sense organs for vision and auditory perception, respectively, in\ncontact with their objects? Here a careful look at the term\n\u2018sannikars\u0323a,\u2019 generally translated as\ncontact, helps resolve the issue;\n\u2018Sannikars\u0323a\u2019 literally means \u2018drawing\nnear,\u2019 and can be interpreted as being in close\nconnection with or in the vicinity of. Thus perception is\nthat which arises out of a close connection between the sense organ\nand its object.\n\nMore substantial debates on the nature of perception focus on the\nadjectives in the latter part of the s\u016btra, viz.,\nnon-verbal (avyapade\u015byam), non-erroneous or\nnon-deviating (avyabhich\u0101ri), and well-ascertained or\nfree from doubt (vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmaka). There is some\ndisagreement among the Naiy\u0101yika commentators about the\ninterpretations of the adjectives non-verbal and well-ascertained.\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana, in his commentary on the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra, argues that the adjectives non-verbal\nand well-ascertained are really part of the definition; non-verbal to\npoint out that perceptual knowledge is not associated with words\n(Bhart\u1e5bhari, the famous Grammarian, on the other hand, holds\nthat awareness is necessarily constituted by words and apprehended\nthrough them) and well-ascertained to affirm that perceptual knowledge\nis only of a definite particular and specifically excludes situations\nin which the perceiver may be in doubt whether a perceived object\n\u2018a\u2019 is an F or a G. V\u0101caspati\nMi\u015bra, argues that the adjective well-ascertained need not be\nused to exclude the so-called perception in the form of doubt, as\ndoubtful knowledge, being invalid, is already excluded by the\nadjective non-erroneous. Rather, the term\nvyavas\u0101y\u0101tmaka stands for determinate perceptual\njudgment. Thus understood, the adjectives non-verbal and\ndeterminate seem to be complementary; a piece of\nnon-verbal perceptual knowledge cannot be said to be, at the\nsame time, determinate. V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra posits that\nthese two adjectives indicate two different forms of perceptual\ncognition and are not to be regarded as its defining characteristics.\nAccording to him, Gautama included these adjectives to identify two\nkinds of perceptual knowledge: avyapade\u015byam\nindicates non-conceptual or non-verbal perception and\nvyavas\u0101y\u0101tmaka indicates conceptual or determinate\nperceptions. He contends that by the term non-verbal, Gautama refutes\nthe Grammarian view and includes non-conceptual perception and, by the\nterm well-ascertained, he refutes the Buddhist view and includes\nconceptual or judgemental perceptions as valid. Pradyot Mondal (1982)\ntraces the history of this controversy among Naiy\u0101yikas. He\noffers overwhelming scholarly evidence in favor of the view that\nNaiy\u0101yikas mostly regard the adjectives as part of the definition\nof perception and do not agree with V\u0101caspati\u2019s\ninterpretation. For most Naiy\u0101yikas \u201cnon-verbal\u201d is\nincluded to deny the causal role of words in origination of perceptual\ncognition and, therefore, it applies to non-conceptual and conceptual\nperceptions both, the difference being that the former is\ninexpressible in language, while the latter is not. Thus Mondal claims\nthat the adjective \u201cnon-verbal\u201d is sufficient on its own\nto reject the Grammarian and the Buddhist views of perception. The\nNy\u0101ya pphilosophers seek the middle ground between these\npositions to defend their thoroughly realist view. They argue that\ntheir is some mental shaping in almost all perceptual events, memory\ndispositions acquired on account of previous experiences are among the\ncausal factors contributing to the current perception. Perceptual\nexperience in this sense is laden with or infused by concepts. This,\nhowever, does not compromise the realism, since the concepts\nthemselves are repeatable features of real objects and are\nperceptually acquired in past encounters with these features. For\nperception to be a source of knowledge it must be concept-laden, such\nthat it is verbalizable and determinate (Phillips, 2019). The exact\nrole of concepts in perception\u2014in dispute in the\nNy\u0101ya/Buddhist debate\u2014will be discussed in the next\nsection.\n\nThe early Naiy\u0101yikas held that perception is determinate, but\nunder pressure from the the Buddhists opponents V\u0101caspati\nMi\u015bra (in about the 10century AD) conceeds that there is also\nconcept-free indeterminate perception. In his commenatry on the\nNy\u0101yasutra 1.1.4, V\u0101caspati interprets the\nqualifiers non-verbal (avyapade\u015byam) and\nwell-ascertained or free from doubt\n(vyavas\u0101y\u0101tmaka) as indicating two types of\nperception: indeterminate and determinate. Indeterminate perception is\nthus conceived as the first stage of sensory processing without any\nmental shaping. The indeterminate sensory percept generated at this\nstage is then classified by the mind resulting in a determinate\nperception of a whole object qualified by its parts (or features).\nThis idea is later taken up by the Navya-Naiy\u0101yika\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, according to whom, indeterminate perception is\nindispensable for explaining how our concepts originate in reality.\nDeterminate perception of a thing as qualified by its features, e.g.,\nThat\u2019s a cow, requires a prior grasp of the qualifier\n\u2018cowness\u2019. The usual explanation will turn to memory\ndispositions acquired by previous encounters with cow. This\nexplanation however cannot be extended to a child\u2019s perception\nof a cow for the first time. In the first instance, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nclaims, the \u2018cowness\u2019 is grasped indeterminately in that\ncowness is grasped but not as related to a particular cow.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba also objects to the notion \u2018sensory\nconnection\u2019 in the classical Ny\u0101yasutra definition\nof perception, arguing that this makes the definition too wide and too\nnarrow at the same time: too wide because it implies that\nevery awareness is perceptual being produced by virtue of a\nconnection with the \u2018inner\u2019 sense faculty or mind\n(manas); too narrow because it fails to include divine\nperception, which involves no sensory connection. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\noffers a simpler definition of perception as an awareness which has no\nother awareness as its chief instrumental cause. Being concerned that\nhis definition may be interpreted as ruling out conceptualized or\ndeterminate perception that may have non-conceptual or indeterminate\nperception as one of it causes, he argues that indeterminate\nperception can never be the chief instrumental cause of\ndeterminate perception, although it is a cause, since it\nsupplies the qualifier or the concept for determinate perception. This\nsimpler definition has other problems. Perception is a source of\nknowledge so Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba must explain how this definition rules\nout non-veridical perceptions. So, he spends the longest Section in\nthe Chapter on Perception in his Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47i Jewel\nof Reflection on the Truth about Epistemology on giving a general\naccount of illusion as \u201cappearance of something other than it\nis\u201d.\n",
