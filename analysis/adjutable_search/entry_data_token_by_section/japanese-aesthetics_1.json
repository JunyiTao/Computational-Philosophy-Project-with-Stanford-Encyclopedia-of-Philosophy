    "main_text": "Mono no aware: the Pathos of Things\n2. Mono no aware: the Pathos of Things\n\nThe meaning of the phrase mono no aware is complex and has\nchanged over time, but it basically refers to a \u201cpathos\u201d\n(aware) of \u201cthings\u201d (mono), deriving\nfrom their transience. In the classic anthology of Japanese poetry\nfrom the eighth century, Many\u014dsh\u016b, the feeling of\naware is typically triggered by the plaintive calls of birds\nor other animals. It also plays a major role in the world\u2019s\nfirst novel, Murasaki Shikibu\u2019s Genji monogatari (The\nTale of Genji), from the early eleventh century. The somewhat later\nHeike monogatari (The Tale of the Heike Clan) begins with\nthese famous lines, which clearly show impermanence as the basis for\nthe feeling of mono no aware:\n\nThe sound of the Gion sh\u014dja bells echoes the\nimpermanence of all things; the color of the s\u014dla\nflowers reveals the truth that the prosperous must decline. The proud\ndo not endure, they are like a dream on a spring night; the mighty\nfall at last, they are as dust before the wind. (McCullough 1988)\n\n\nAnd here is Kenk\u014d on the link between impermanence and beauty:\n\u201cIf man were never to fade away like the dews of Adashino, never\nto vanish like the smoke over Toribeyama, how things would lose their\npower to move us! The most precious thing in life is its\nuncertainty\u201d (Keene, 7). The acceptance and celebration of\nimpermanence goes beyond all morbidity, and enables full enjoyment of\nlife:\n\nHow is it possible for men not to rejoice each day over the pleasure\nof being alive? Foolish men, forgetting this pleasure, laboriously\nseek others; forgetting the wealth they possess, they risk their lives\nin their greed for new wealth. But their desires are never satisfied.\nWhile they live they do not rejoice in life, but, when faced with\ndeath, they fear it\u2014what could be more illogical? (Keene, 79)\n\n\nInsofar as we don\u2019t rejoice in life we fail to appreciate the\npathos of the things with which we share our lives. For most of us,\nsome of these things, impermanent as they are, will outlast\nus\u2014and especially if they have been loved they will become sad\nthings: \u201cIt is sad to think that a man\u2019s familiar\npossessions, indifferent to his death, should remain long after he is\ngone\u201d (Keene, 30).\n\nThe well known literary theorist Motoori Norinaga brought the idea of\nmono no aware to the forefront of literary theory with a\nstudy of The Tale of Genji that showed this phenomenon to be\nits central theme. He argues for a broader understanding of it as\nconcerning a profound sensitivity to the emotional and affective\ndimensions of existence in general. The greatness of Lady\nMurasaki\u2019s achievement consists in her ability to portray\ncharacters with a profound sense of mono no aware in her\nwriting, such that the reader is able to empathize with them in this\nfeeling.\n\nThe films of Ozu Yasujir\u014d, who is often thought to be the most\n\u201cJapanese\u201d of Japanese film directors, are a series of\nexercises in conveying mono no aware. Stanley Cavell\u2019s\nobservation that \u201cfilm returns to us and extends our first\nfascination with objects, with their inner and fixed lives\u201d\napplies consummately to Ozu, who often expresses feelings through\npresenting the faces of things rather than of actors. A vase standing\nin the corner of a tatami-matted room where a father and daughter are\nasleep; two fathers contemplating the rocks in a \u201cdry\nlandscape\u201d garden, their postures echoing the shapes of the\nstone; a mirror reflecting the absence of the daughter who has just\nleft home after getting married\u2014all images that express the\npathos of things as powerfully as the expression on the greatest\nactor\u2019s face.\n\nThe most frequently cited example of mono no aware in\ncontemporary Japan is the traditional love of cherry blossoms, as\nmanifested by the huge crowds of people that go out every year to view\n(and picnic under) the cherry trees. The blossoms of the Japanese\ncherry trees are intrinsically no more beautiful than those of, say,\nthe pear or the apple tree: they are more highly valued because of\ntheir transience, since they usually begin to fall within a week of\ntheir first appearing. It is precisely the evanescence of their beauty\nthat evokes the wistful feeling of mono no aware in the\nviewer.\n",
