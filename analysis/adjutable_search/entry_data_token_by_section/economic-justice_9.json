    "main_text": "Welfare Economics || Harsanyi\u2019s Theorems\n3.2 Harsanyi\u2019s Theorems\n\nHarsanyi may be viewed as the last representative of the old welfare\neconomics, to which he made a major contribution in the form of two\narguments. The first one is often called the \u201cimpartial observer\nargument\u201d. An impartial observer should decide for society as if\nshe had an equal chance of becoming anyone in the considered\npopulation. This is a risky situation in which the standard decision\ncriterion is expected utility. The computation of expected utility, in\nthis equal probability case, yields an arithmetic mean of the\nutilities that the observer would have if she became anyone in the\npopulation. Harsanyi (1953) considers this to be an argument in favor\nof utilitarianism. The obvious weakness of the argument, however, is\nthat not all versions of utilitarianism would measure individual\nutility in a way that may be entered in the computation of the\nexpected utility of the impartial observer. In other words, ask a\nutilitarian to compute social welfare, and ask an impartial observer\nto compute her expected utility. There is little reason to believe\nthat they will come up with similar conclusions, even though both\ncompute a sum or a mean. For instance, a very risk-averse impartial\nobserver may come arbitrarily close to the maximin criterion.\n\nThis argument has triggered controversies, in particular with Rawls\n(1974), about the soundness of the maximin criterion in the original\nposition, and with Sen (1977b). See Harsanyi (1976) and recent\nanalyses in Weymark (1991), Mongin (2001a). There is a related, but\ndifferent controversy about the consequences of the veil of ignorance\nin Dworkin\u2019s hypothetical insurance scheme (Dworkin 2000).\nRoemer (1985) argues that if individuals maximize their expected\nutility on the insurance market, they insure against states in which\nthey have low marginal utility. If low marginal utility happens to be\nthe consequence of some handicaps, then the hypothetical market will\ntax the disabled for the benefit of the others, a paradoxical but\ntypical consequence of utilitarian policies. It is indeed well known\nthat insurance markets have strange consequences when utilities are\nstate-dependent (that is, when the utility of income is affected by\nrandom events). For a recent revival of this controversy, see Dworkin\n(2002), Fleurbaey (2008) and Roemer (2002a).\n\nHarsanyi\u2019s second argument, the \u201caggregation\ntheorem\u201d, is about a social planner who, facing risky prospects,\nmaximizes expected social welfare and wants to respect individual\npreferences about prospects. Harsanyi (1955) shows that these two\nconditions imply that social welfare must be a weighted sum of\nindividual utilities, and concludes that this is another argument in\nfavor of utilitarianism. Recent evaluation of this argument and its\nconsequences may be found in Broome (1991), Weymark (1991). In\nparticular, Broome uses the structure of this argument to conclude\nthat social good must be computed as the sum of individual goods,\nalthough this does not preclude incorporating a good deal of\ninequality aversion in the measurement of individual good. Diamond\n(1967) has raised a famous objection against the idea that expected\nutility is a good criterion for the social planner. This criterion\nimplies that if the social planner is indifferent between the\ndistributions of utilities, for two individuals, (1,0) and (0,1), then\nhe must also be indifferent between these two distributions and an\nequal probability of getting either distribution. This is paradoxical,\nthis lottery being ex ante better since it gives equal prospects to\nindividuals. Broome (1991) raises another puzzle. An even better\nlottery would yield either (0,0) or (1,1) with equal probability. It\nis better because ex ante it gives individuals the same prospects as\nthe previous lottery, and it is more egalitarian ex post. The problem\nis that it seems quite hard to construct a social criterion which\nranks these four alternatives as suggested here. Defining social\nwelfare under uncertainty is still a matter of bafflement. See\nDeschamps and Gevers (1977), Ben Porath, Gilboa and Schmeidler (1997),\nFleurbaey (2010). Things are even more difficult when probabilities\nare subjective and individual beliefs may differ. Harsanyi\u2019s\naggregation theorem then transforms into an impossibility theorem. On\nthis, see in particular Hylland and Zeckhauser (1979), Mongin (1995),\nBradley (2005), Mongin and Pivato (2016, 2020), Dietrich (2021).\n",
