    "main_text": "Duty and Respect for Moral Law\n3. Duty and Respect for Moral Law\n\nAccording to Kant, what is singular about motivation by duty is that\nit consists of bare respect for the moral law. What naturally comes to\nmind is this: Duties are rules or laws of some sort combined with some\nsort of felt constraint or incentive on our choices, whether from\nexternal coercion by others or from our own powers of reason. For\ninstance, the bylaws of a club lay down duties for its officers and\nenforce them with sanctions. City and state laws establish the duties\nof citizens and enforce them with coercive legal power. Thus, if we do\nsomething because it is our \u201ccivic\u201d duty, or our duty\n\u201cas a boy scout\u201d or \u201ca good American,\u201d our\nmotivation is respect for the code that makes it our duty. Thinking we\nare duty bound is simply respecting, as such, certain laws pertaining\nto us.\n\nHowever intuitive, this cannot be all of Kant\u2019s meaning. For one\nthing, as with the Jim Crow laws of the old South and the Nuremberg\nlaws of Nazi Germany, the laws to which these types of \u201cactions\nfrom duty\u201d conform may be morally despicable. Respect for such\nlaws could hardly be thought valuable. For another, our motive in\nconforming our actions to civic and other laws is rarely unconditional\nrespect. We also have an eye toward doing our part in maintaining\ncivil or social order, toward punishments or loss of standing and\nreputation in violating such laws, and other outcomes of lawful\nbehavior. Indeed, we respect these laws to the degree, but only to the\ndegree, that they do not violate values, laws or principles we hold\nmore dear. Yet Kant thinks that, in acting from duty, we are not at\nall motivated by a prospective outcome or some other extrinsic feature\nof our conduct except insofar as these are requirements of duty\nitself. We are motivated by the mere conformity of our will to law as\nsuch.\n\nTo act out of respect for the moral law, in Kant\u2019s view, is to\nbe moved to act by a recognition that the moral law is a supremely\nauthoritative standard that binds us and to experience a kind of\nfeeling, which is akin to awe and fear, when we acknowledge the moral\nlaw as the source of moral requirements. Human persons inevitably have\nrespect for the moral law even though we are not always moved by it\nand even though we do not always comply with the moral standards that\nwe nonetheless recognize as authoritative.\n\nKant\u2019s account of the content of moral requirements and the\nnature of moral reasoning is based on his analysis of the unique force\nmoral considerations have as reasons to act. The force of moral\nrequirements as reasons is that we cannot ignore them no matter how\ncircumstances might conspire against any other consideration. Basic\nmoral requirements retain their reason-giving force under any\ncircumstance, they have universal validity. So, whatever else may be\nsaid of basic moral requirements, their content is universal. Only a\nuniversal law could be the content of a requirement that has the\nreason-giving force of morality. This brings Kant to a preliminary\nformulation of the CI: \u201cI ought never to act except in such a\nway that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal\nlaw\u201d (G 4:402). This is the principle which motivates a good\nwill, and which Kant holds to be the fundamental principle of all of\nmorality.\n",
