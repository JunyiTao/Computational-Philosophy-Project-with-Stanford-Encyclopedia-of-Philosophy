    "main_text": "What Is It to Believe? || Functionalism\n1.4 Functionalism\n\nMany philosophers identify themselves as functionalists (see\n functionalism)\n about mental states in general or belief in particular. Functionalism\nabout mental states is the view that what makes something a mental\nstate of a particular type are its actual and potential, or its\ntypical, causal relations to sensory stimulations, behavior, and other\nmental states (seminal sources include Armstrong 1968; Fodor 1968;\nLewis 1972, 1980; Putnam 1975; Block 1978). Functionalists generally\ncontrast their view with the view that what makes something a mental\nstate of a particular type are facts about its internal structure. To\nunderstand this distinction, it may be helpful to begin with some\nnon-mental examples. Arguably, what makes something a streptococcal\nbacterium, or a cube, is its shape or internal structure; its causal\nhistory or proneness to produce particular effects on particular\noccasions is only secondarily relevant, if at all. In contrast,\nwhether something is a hard drive or not is not principally a matter\nof internal structure. A hard drive could be made of plastic or steel,\nemploy magnetic tape or lasers. What matters are the causal\nrelationships it\u2019s prone to enter with a computer: Under certain\npromptings, it enters states such that, under certain further\npromptings, it will generate outputs of a certain sort. Internal\nstructure is relevant only secondarily, insofar as it grounds these\ncausal capacities. Likewise, according to the functionalist, what\nmakes a state pain is not its particular neural\nconfiguration. People and animals with very different neural\nconfigurations could all equally be in pain (even, conceivably, a\nMartian with an internal structure radically different from ours could\nsuffer pain). What matters is that the subject is in a state that\n(roughly) is apt to be caused by tissue damage or tissue stress and\nthat, in turn, is apt to cause signs of distress, withdrawal, future\navoidance of the painful stimulus, and (in verbal subjects) thoughts\nand utterances like \u201cthat hurts!\u201d.\n\nPhilosophers frequently endorse functionalism about belief without\neven briefly sketching out the various particular functional\nrelationships that are supposed to be involved, though Loar (1981) is\na notable exception to this tendency (see also Leitgeb 2017). However,\namong the causal relationships contemporary philosophers have often\nseen as characteristic of belief are the following (these are sketched\nhere only roughly; they come in many versions differing in\nnuance):\n\n\n(1) Reflection on propositions (e.g., [Q] and [if Q\nthen P]) from which P straightforwardly follows, if\none believes those propositions and is not antecedently committed to\nthe falsity of P, typically causes the belief that\nP.\n\n(2) Directing perceptual attention to the perceptible properties of\nthings, events, or states of affairs, in conditions favorable to\naccurate perception, typically causes the belief that those things,\nevents, or states of affairs have those properties (e.g., visually\nattending to a red shirt in good viewing conditions will typically\ncause the belief that the shirt is red).\n\n(3) Believing that performing action A would lead to event or\nstate of affairs E, conjoined with a desire for E\nand no overriding contrary desire, will typically cause an intention\nto do A.\n\n(4) Believing that P, in conditions favoring sincere\nexpression of that belief, will typically lead to an assertion of\nP.\n\n\nLoar emphasizes versions of (2) and (3) over (1) and (4), but one sees\nconditions of this sort at least briefly alluded to by a number of\nfunctionalist philosophers, including Armstrong (1973), Dennett (1969,\n1978), Stalnaker (1984), Fodor (1990), Pettit (1993), Shoemaker\n(2003), and Zimmerman (2018). For the functionalist, to believe just\nis to be in a state that plays this sort of causal role. The intimate\nconnection, noted in (3), between belief and action is also\nhistorically rooted in the pragmatist tradition (Bain 1859/1876;\nPeirce 1878).\n\nAs the list of names of the previous paragraph suggests, functionalism\nis compatible with either a representationalist approach to belief (as\nin Fodor) or an interpretationist one (as in Dennett). (The\ninterpretationist, of course, will have to treat the relevant\nfunctional states as posits of an interpretative theory or scheme.)\nDispositional accounts of belief, too, can be functionalist. Indeed,\ndispositional accounts can be seen as a special or limiting case of\nfunctional accounts. To see this, it\u2019s helpful to divide the\ncausal relations appealed to by functionalism into the\nbackward-looking and the forward-looking.\nBackward-looking causal relations pertain to what actually,\npotentially, or typically causes the state in question;\nforward-looking causal relations pertain to what effects the\nstate in question actually, potentially, or typically has. Thus (1)\nand (2) above are backward-looking causal relations, while (3) and (4)\nare forward-looking. We might, then, see the dispositionalist as a\nfunctionalist who thinks only the forward-looking causal relations are\ndefinitive of belief: To believe is to be in a state apt to cause\nsuch-and-such behavioral (or other) manifestations. (This view is, of\ncourse, compatible with accepting the existence of regularities like\n(1) and (2), as long as they are not regarded as defining\ncharacteristics of belief.) Two caveats, however, should accompany\nthis reduction of dispositionalism to functionalism: First, insofar as\nfunctionalism about belief requires a causal relationship\nbetween the belief state and its manifestations in behavior (or in\nother mental states), it will exclude dispositionalists like Ryle\n(1949) who don\u2019t view the disposition-manifestation relationship\ncausally (for discussion, see Section 6 (\u2018The causal efficacy of\ndispositions\u2019) of the entry on\n dispositions).\n Second, the liberal dispositionalist may wish to demur from the\nfunctionalist\u2019s usual commitment to the reducibility of facts\nabout functionally-definable mental states, en masse and in\nprinciple (allowing for the intricate network of interrelationships\namong them), to facts about sensory inputs and outward behavior.\n\nThe compatibility of functionalism and representationalism is not\nevident on its face, though a number of prominent philosophers appear\nto embrace both positions (e.g., Fodor 1968, 1975, 1981, 1990;\nArmstrong 1973; Harman 1973; Lycan 1981a, 1981b; Stalnaker 1984; Lewis\n1994). As Millikan (1984), Papineau (1984), and others have suggested,\nit seems one thing to say that to believe is to be in a state that\nfills a particular causal role, and it seems quite another to\nsay that beliefs are essentially states that represent how\nthings stand in the world. How can something represent the world\noutside simply by virtue of playing a certain causal role in a\ncognitive system? Suppose, for example, that a state represents by\nvirtue of having an indicator function of the sort described at the\nend of \u00a71.1 above. The indicator function of an internal state or\nsystem would seem, at least sometimes and in part, to depend\nconstitutively on the evolutionary history of that state or system, or\nits learning history, and not simply on the causal relationships it is\ncurrently disposed to enter. Despite the word\n\u201cfunction\u201d in \u201cfunctionalism\u201d, it\u2019s not\nclear that standard functionalist accounts, limited as they are to\nappeal to a state\u2019s actual, potential, or typical causal roles,\ncan incorporate facts about a system\u2019s evolutionary history or\nlearning history: Conceivably, for example, two states in different\nindividuals may have exactly analogous causal roles, yet differ in\ntheir (as Millikan says) \u201cproper function\u201d because of\ndifferences in the evolutionary or learning history of those\nsystems.\n\nThree escapes from this potential difficulty suggest themselves. One\nis to endorse a version of \u201cconceptual [or functional] role\nsemantics\u201d according to which the representational status and\ncontent of a mental state is reducible just to facts about what is apt\nto cause and to be caused by the mental state in question\u2014that\nis, to deny the relevance of remote evolutionary or learning history\n(e.g., Harman 1973, 1987). Another is to accept that causal role\ndetermines the representational status of a mental state\n(i.e., that it is a representation) but does not fully\nspecify representational content (i.e. how that\nrepresentation represents things as being); but this seems to involve\nabandoning full-blown functionalism. A third is to interpret more\nliberally what it is for a mental state to be \u201ctypically\ncaused\u201d (or perhaps \u201cnormally caused\u201d) by some event\nor state of affairs: Perhaps it is enough that in the young organism,\nor its evolutionary ancestors, mental states of that sort were caused\nin a particular way, or the system was selected to be responsive to\ncertain sorts of environmental factors. Such claims may be more easily\nreconcilable with certain canonical statements of functionalism (such\nas Lewis 1980) than with others (such as Putnam 1975). The issue has\nnot been as fully discussed as it should be.\n",
