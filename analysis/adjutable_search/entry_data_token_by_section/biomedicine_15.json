    "main_text": "Alternative Frameworks || Narrative and phenomenological approaches\n5.3 Gentle medicine and population health framework approaches\n\nStegenga has argued in favor of \u201cgentle medicine,\u201d a\nconservative treatment mindset that stands in contrast to the\nbiomedical pursuit of ever-more interventions (Stegenga 2018)\u2014a\npill for each ailment. This is in one sense a challenge to biomedicine\nmore in quantity than in quality; he does not advocate for switching\nfrom pills to naturopathic diet-based treatments. He recommends this\n(purportedly gentler) conservatism as a response to an epistemic\ndevaluing of biomedicine knowledge which he calls: \u201cmedical\nnihilism\u2026the view that we should have little confidence in the\neffectiveness of medical interventions\u201d (Stegenga 2018: 1). This\nfollows in the loose tradition of other writings, such as the text by\nIllich discussed at the start of\n Section 5\n (Illich 1976). But Stegenga\u2019s critique and replacement remains\na radical challenge to biomedicine in the sense that it undercuts the\nepistemic practices of biomedicine and pushes back on the\ninstitutional practices (and the related infrastructure, including\nmassive pharmaceutical companies) by arguing that (bio)medical\ntreatments ought to be applied sparingly.\n\nValles offers an alternative\u2014the population health\nframework\u2014that partly meshes with Stegenga\u2019s concluding\nsuggestion that \u201cgentle medicine\u201d ought to be accompanied\nby interventions that refocus health promotion efforts on social\ndeterminants of health, including \u201cclean drinking water, better\nnutrition, and greater socio-economic equality\u201d (Stegenga 2018:\n198). Valles expounds and defends the merits of the population health\nframework, a view developed in response to frustrations with\nbiomedicine that coalesced in the 1990s in Canada as an alternative\ntheoretical framework, before expanding internationally (Evans, Barer,\n& Marmor 1994; Valles 2018). The population health framework is\nnot nihilistic about medical care, but rather seeks to decenter\nmedicine and healthcare in the overall pursuit of health; most of the\nproblems and most promising solutions to ill health lay outside the\nscope of biomedicine (safer workplaces, an end to racist housing\ndiscrimination, neighborhoods where people can safely walk, socialize\nand play, etc.) (Valles 2018).\n",
