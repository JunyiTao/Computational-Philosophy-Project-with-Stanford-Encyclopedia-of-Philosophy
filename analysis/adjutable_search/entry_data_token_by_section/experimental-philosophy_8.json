    "main_text": "Challenges to Experimental Philosophy || Disputing the Role of Intuitions in Philosophy\n3.1 Disputing the Role of Intuitions in Philosophy\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, much work in experimental philosophy presupposes\nthat intuitions play an important role in philosophical inquiry. Work\nin the negative program characteristically starts with the assumption\nthat intuitions play a central role in the philosophical tradition.\nOutside of the negative program, experimental philosophers want to\nunderstand what people\u2019s intuitions are about philosophical\nmatters and why they have these intuitions. Several philosophers,\nhowever, challenge the role of intuitions in philosophy in ways that\nalso pose a challenge to the philosophical significance of much\nexperimental philosophy.\n3.1.1 Philosophers don\u2019t rely on intuitions\n\nOne way to reject the role of intuitions is simply to deny that\nphilosophers use intuitions as justification for their views\n(Williamson 2007; Cappelen 2012; Deutsch 2009, 2010, 2015). According\nto such \u201cintuition deniers\u201d, the experimental\ninvestigation of intuitions is thoroughly irrelevant to philosophy\n(e.g., Cappelen 2012: 1; for discussion, Nado 2016). Obviously if this is right, then\nthe negative program is arguing against a thoroughly mistaken\nconception of philosophy.\n\nAlthough work in metaphilosophy often assumes that philosophers use\nintuitions as evidence, this is exactly what is challenged by\nintuition deniers. It is granted on all sides that philosophers\nsometimes mention intuitions, but according to the intuition deniers,\nintuitions are not integral to the philosophical work. In particular,\nintuition deniers maintain that a careful inspection of philosophical\npractice reveals that philosophers don\u2019t rely on intuitions to\njustify philosophical views; rather, philosophers rely on\narguments (see, e.g., Cappelen 2012: 170; Deutsch 2009:\n451).\n\nThere have been several responses to the intuition deniers, but\nperhaps the most prominent response to is that the arguments of\nintuition deniers depend on an implausibly strong conception of the\nnotion of intuition (e.g., Chalmers 2014; Devitt 2015;\nWeinberg 2014). Once we focus on a less demanding notion of intuition,\nit\u2019s plausible that philosophers often rely on intuitions as\nevidence for philosophical theses (Devitt 2015). Indeed, some have\nargued that for classic examples like Gettier cases, it\u2019s hard\nto see how the argument works if it doesn\u2019t rely on intuitions\n(see, e.g., Brown 2017; Sytsma & Livengood 2015: 92\u201393)\nExperimental philosophers have also argued against intuition deniers\non experimental grounds, noting that a recent study found that over\n50% of philosophers agree with the statement \u201cintuitions are\nuseful for justifying philosophical claims\u201d (Kuntz & Kuntz\n2011; see Sytsma & Livengood 2015: 91).\n3.1.2 Philosophers shouldn\u2019t rely on intuitions\n\nA rather different way to challenge the study of intuitions in\nexperimental philosophy is to deny that the study of intuitions is an\napt subject matter for philosophical inquiry. On this view, we can\ngrant that it\u2019s a fact that philosophers rely on intuitions, but\nit\u2019s a lamentable fact. The use of intuitions in philosophy is\nmisguided for reasons that have nothing in particular to do with\nexperimental philosophy\u2014the appeal to intuitions is a relic,\nwhich should be rejected because it doesn\u2019t actually answer the\nphilosophical questions. This conclusion threatens positive\napplications of experimental philosophy (see, e.g.,\n sections 2.2\u20132.4),\n but is of course, perfectly consistent with the conclusion urged by\nthe negative program in experimental philosophy\n (section 2.1).\n\nOne influential argument against the use of intuitions builds on the\nrejection of descriptivist theories of reference, according to which\nconcepts refer to kinds via a set of associated descriptions. In place\nof descriptivism, some maintain that concepts refer in virtue of the\nfunction of the concept (e.g., Millikan 2000). Other views maintain\nthat concepts refer in virtue of a causal chain connecting the concept\nto the kind (Putnam 1973). On these anti-descriptivist views, people\ncan have wildly mistaken intuitions regarding the application of their\nconcepts. As a result, probing lay intuitions might be an ineffective\nway to investigate the kinds of things to which our concepts refer\n(e.g., Fischer 2015; Kornblith 2002).\n\nAnti-descriptivism itself doesn\u2019t entail that appeal to\nintuitions is philosophically irrelevant. Indeed, some of the most\ninfluential arguments against descriptivist theories of reference seem\nto depend on intuitions (Devitt 2015). However, some argue that rather\nthan relying on intuitions about kinds, we should investigate the\nkinds themselves. So, if the concept knowledge picks out a\nnatural kind, we can consult the distribution and characteristics of\nknowledge as it is instantiated in the world. Using intuitions to\nunderstand knowledge would be like using intuitions to\nunderstand gold. The way we come to understand the nature of\ngold is to examine samples of gold rather than people\u2019s\nintuitions about gold. Similarly, the way to understand\nknowledge is to examine samples of knowledge as it presents\nin animals, rather than people\u2019s intuitions about knowledge\n(Kornblith 2002). To examine knowledge by intuitions is at best\ninefficient, and at worst a complete distraction from the task of\nunderstanding what knowledge is. This objection is primarily directed\nat traditional forms of conceptual analysis, but insofar as\nexperimental philosophy focuses on intuitions, it is in the same leaky\nboat (Kornblith 2013: 197).\n\nThe claim that philosophers shouldn\u2019t rely on intuitions\nconstitutes a broad attack on conceptual analysis, in both its\ntraditional and experimental guises. Not surprisingly, there have been\nseveral defenses of the importance of intuitions for doing philosophy.\nFor instance, some philosophers argue that in order even to pick out\nthe kind of interest, we need to rely on our intuitive sense of what\nbelongs in the category (e.g., Goldman 2015). To determine the\ncharacteristics of knowledge, we need to have a way of picking out\nwhich items are genuine members of the kind, and for this we must rely\non our intuitive understanding of knowledge. In addition, if we reject\noutright the appeal to what intuitively belongs to a category,\nit\u2019s hard to make sense of the intelligibility of eliminativism\n(e.g., Berm\u00fadez 2006: 305), since eliminativists typically\nargue that there is a mismatch between intuitive notions of, e.g.,\nfree will, and the kinds of things in the world. To give up on the\nsignificance of characterizing our intuitive commitments is to\npreemptively exclude eliminativist views, which have long been\nregarded as of central philosophical interest.\n3.2 Defending Privileged Intuitions Rather Than Those of Ordinary Experimental Participants\n\nA second objection would be that even if intuitions do matter, we\nshould not be concerned with just any old kind of intuition. Rather,\nour concern should be with a distinctive class of intuitions.\nFor example, research in philosophy has traditionally been conducted\nby trained philosophers who spent years thinking about difficult\nproblems. There is good reason to suspect that the intuitions\ngenerated by this type of process will have a special sort of\nepistemic status, and perhaps these sorts of intuitions can play a\nlegitimate role in philosophy. By contrast, the intuitions explored\nwithin experimental philosophy research tend to be those of ordinary\nfolks, with no prior background in philosophy, and one might think\nthat intuitions of this latter type have no real philosophical\nsignificance.\n\nOne way of spelling out this concern is in terms of what has come to\nbe known as the expertise objection. The key contention here\nis that trained philosophers have a distinctive type of expertise.\nThus, if we want to understand the process at the core of traditional\nphilosophical practice, we need to study people who have this type of\nexpertise. It is no good just looking at the judgments of people who\nhave never taken a single philosophy course. A number of philosophers\nhave developed objections along more or less these lines though with\nimportant differences (Williamson 2007; Ludwig 2007).\n\nThis is an important objection, and to address it, experimental\nphilosophers launched a major effort to study the intuitions of\ntrained philosophers. The results show that trained philosophers still\nshow order effects (Schwitzgebel & Cushman 2012), actor/observer\neffects (Tobia et al. 2013), and effects of temperament (Schulz,\nCokely, & Feltz 2011). Thus, existing work provides at least some\nevidence against the claim that trained philosophers have a\ndistinctive expertise that allows them to escape the sorts of biases\nthat plague the judgments of ordinary folks.\n\nOf course, there are numerous ways of defending the objection against\nthis type of response. It could be argued that although philosophers\ndo not have an ability to avoid biases of the type studied within\nexperimental philosophy, their judgments do differ from those of\nordinary folks in some other important respect. Similarly, it could be\nargued that what gives certain intuitions their privileged epistemic\nstate is not the fact that they come from a particular type of person\n(trained philosophers) but rather the fact that they are the product\nof a particular way of approaching the question (sustained reflection)\n(see, e.g., Kauppinen 2007).\n3.3 But is it Philosophy?\n\nFinally, it might be objected that experimental philosophy simply\nisn\u2019t philosophy at all. On this view, there are certain\nproperties that differentiate work in philosophy from work in other\ndisciplines. Research in experimental philosophy lacks these\nproperties and is therefore best understood as falling outside the\nphilosophical tradition entirely. Note that this last objection is not\nconcerned with the question as to whether experimental philosophy has\nany value but rather with the question as to whether it should be\nconsidered part of a particular discipline. As one recent paper puts\nit, \n\n\n\u2026 what is at issue is not whether there is room for such\nempirical study, but whether there is room for it now as a branch of\nphilosophy. (Sorell forthcoming: 6)\n\n\nIn actual practice, debate over this objection has tended to focus on\nquestions in the history of philosophy. Clearly, numerous philosophers\nfrom Aristotle through Nietzsche were deeply concerned with empirical\nquestions about human nature, so it might seem that the default view,\nat least in the absence of any counterarguments, should be that work\non these issues can indeed count as philosophy. The key question,\nthen, is whether there are any legitimate counterarguments.\n\nOne possible argument would be that although the people we now regard\nas philosophers did work on these issues, this aspect of their work\nshould not be regarded as falling within the discipline of philosophy.\nAnthony Appiah questions this gambit:\n\n\nYou would have a difficult time explaining to most of the canonical\nphilosophers that this part of the work was echt\nphilosophy and that part of their work was not. Trying to\nseparate out the \u201cmetaphysical\u201d from the\n\u201cpsychological\u201d elements in this corpus is like trying to\npeel a raspberry. (Appiah 2008: 13)\n\n\nAccording to this response, there is a well-established practice\nwithin the history of philosophy of exploring empirical and\npsychological questions, and it is actually the idea of carefully\nseparating the psychological from the philosophical that should be\nregarded as a departure from philosophical tradition.\n\nMore recent work on these issues has been concerned especially with\nthe early modern period. It has been noted that some of the most\nprominent philosophers in this period actually conducted experimental\nstudies (Sytsma & Livengood 2015), and some explicitly referred to\nthemselves as \u2018experimental philosophers\u2019 (Anstey &\nVanzo 2016). Though contemporary experimental philosophy obviously\ndiffers in certain respects from these historical antecedents, one\nmight argue that the work of contemporary experimental philosophers is\nbest understood as a continuation of this broad historical\ntradition.\n\nOn the other side, it has been argued that this historical continuity\npicture fails to take account of a change in the use of the word\n\u2018philosophy\u2019 (Sorell forthcoming). In the Renaissance,\nphysics was referred to as \u2018philosophy,\u2019 but we would not\nsay that all research in contemporary physics belongs in the\ndiscipline of philosophy. Similarly, even if work on the psychology of\nmoral judgment was historically classified as philosophy, one might\nthink that it should not be regarded today as falling into the\ndiscipline of philosophy but rather into a distinct discipline.\n\nCertainly, partisans on both sides of this debate should agree that\nthe boundaries of a discipline can change over time, but this point\ncuts both ways. Just as the boundaries of a discipline may have\nchanged in the past, they can change in the future. It will therefore\nbe interesting to see how the boundaries of the discipline of\nphilosophy evolve over the course of the next few decades and how this\nevolution impacts the status of experimental philosophy.",
