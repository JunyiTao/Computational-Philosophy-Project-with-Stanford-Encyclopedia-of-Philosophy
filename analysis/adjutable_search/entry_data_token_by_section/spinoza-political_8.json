    "main_text": "The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus || Countering Superstition\n3.1 Countering Superstition\n\n\nThe TTP contains a good deal of what has come to be known as biblical\ncriticism. Through careful linguistic and historical exegesis Spinoza\nidentifies numerous textual inconsistencies, which, with some\nphilosophical buttressing, lead Spinoza to deny the exalted status of\nprophets, the objective reality of miracles, and ultimately the divine origin of\nthe Pentateuch. The broad features of his critique are vital to our\nunderstanding of Spinoza\u2019s response to the \u201ctheologico-political\nproblem\u201d (Smith 1997) that plagued the Dutch Republic. (For two\nrecent first-rate monographs on the TTP that situate Spinoza\u2019s\ncritique of Scripture in historical context, see Nadler 2011 and James\n2012)\n\n\nAmong the politically relevant claims that Spinoza makes in the\nfirst fifteen chapters of the work is that Scripture does not compete\nwith philosophy as a source of knowledge; nor do the injunctions of\nScripture compete with the commands of civil authorities. By separating\nfaith from reason and making religion\u2019s role in the public realm\nsubordinate to that of the state, Spinoza tries to sanitize religion of\nits pernicious superstitious aspects. We may call the claim that faith is distinct\nfrom reason the separation thesis and the claim that religious\nlaw is dependent on and determined by civil law the single\nauthority thesis.\n",
