    "main_text": "Conceptions of the Legitimacy of Political Authority\n2. Conceptions of the Legitimacy of Political Authority\n\n\nFew theorists after Thomas Hobbes and David Hume have argued that\nthere is a general duty to obey the law or that political authority is\ngenerally legitimate (Hobbes 1668; Hume 1965). Most theorists have\nargued that the legitimacy of political authority is one that holds\nonly when the political authority satisfies certain normatively\nimportant conditions. What we will review here are some of the main\ntheories that attempt to explain when a political authority has\nlegitimacy.\n\n\nGeneral theories are theories that identify general properties that\nvirtually any kind of political regime can have that gives them\nlegitimacy. Special theories are ones that mark off particular classes\nof regimes that have legitimacy or that have a particularly high level\nof legitimacy. There are really four types of general theory of\npolitical authority and then there are a variety of special theories of\npolitical authority. The four types of general theory of legitimacy are\nconsent theories, reasonable consensus theories, associative obligation\ntheories and instrumentalist theories. The two historically important\nforms of special theory in the West have been the Divine Right of Kings\ntheories and democratic theories.\n",
