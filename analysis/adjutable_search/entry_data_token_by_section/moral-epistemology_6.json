Evolutionary: Biological Explanations of Why Morals Evolved\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the last three objections to moral naturalism\nare advanced by those who believe moral knowledge is possible but\nreject the idea that it is knowledge of the natural world. Of course,\nshould those objections be successful, the upshot could be a victory\nfor the moral skeptic, since the objections to thinking of moral\nknowledge as theological or as knowledge of a non-natural world may be\njust as successful. The problems for the possibility of moral\nknowledge, in short, must be seen holistically in view of the\ninterlocking implications of the objections and replies. The following\ndiscussion of the implications of biological explanations of morals is\nno exception.\n\n\nSome moral skeptics argue that Darwinian explanations of the origins\nand persistence of morals among humans undermine the likelihood that\nmoral beliefs are true and hence undermine the possibility of moral\nknowledge. These \u201cdebunking\u201d arguments are discussed under three\nheadings. In each case we suppose, as Darwin suggested (Darwin 1982\n[1871]), that human morality originated and persisted among our\nancestors primarily as an adaptation fashioned by natural\nselection. This supposition is compatible with cultural evolution\nplaying an enormous role in bringing us from proto-morals to modern\nforms of morality in all their striking variation. The basic thought,\nhowever, is that primitive moral inclinations, such as toward helping\nfamily and avoiding harm even to strangers, remain with us as prima\nfacie reasons for action, even when contrary moral considerations may\noverride these core inclinations. Thus, even though modern moralities\nhave evolved culturally, they are, on this premise, constructed from\ncertain core adaptations. That thought is well-developed in current\naccounts of the evolution of morals (see Copp 2008, pp. 187\u201390, and\nCampbell 2009, for a summary and references). While it is not beyond\ncriticism (see the entry on Morality and Evolutionary Biology), I will\nassume this premise, for the sake of argument, without further\nelaboration. Strikingly, this premise, if granted, is enough to give\nweight to the three debunking arguments that follow.\n4.1 The Debunking Argument from Parsimony, Clarity, and Non-circularity\n\n\nSome debunkers argue that the Darwinian explanation of core moral\nbeliefs is in direct competition with the commonsense view that these\ncore beliefs are true and that we believe them because their truth is\nobvious. They argue, however, that the Darwinian explanation of our\ncore moral beliefs is superior, since it is more parsimonious,\nclearer, and better supported by the evidence (Ruse 1986; Joyce\n2006; Street 2006: Kahane 2011). The Darwinian explanation is\nbetter, first of all, because it does not need to postulate the\nexistence of any moral truth. We have seen in the preceding section\nhow difficult it is to explain in uncontested ontological terms what\nmoral truth might consist in. The things whose existence is\nfundamental in the Darwinian story, on the other hand, are neither\nmysterious nor contentious, such as the tendency to reciprocate\nkindness and extend help to those in need. Moreover, the mechanism of\nnatural selection is, in general terms at least, very well-understood\nand could be applied to the altruistic tendencies mentioned. Core\nmoral \u201cbeliefs\u201d would be taken to express just such heritable\ntendencies. Individuals in groups with more of these tendencies than\nother groups would do better at survival and reproduction than those\nin other groups so that the tendencies would in time spread among\ngroups in the larger population (Kitcher 1993; Sober and Wilson\n1998; Bowles and Gintis 2011). By contrast, theories about how our ancestors were able to\ngrasp moral truth, say by means of rational intuition or religious\nfaith, are comparatively unclear and do not cohere with current\nscience. Of course, we are assuming just for the sake of argument,\nthat the evidence that supports the Darwinian explanation is\ncogent. To be fair, could we not make a parallel assumption about the\nevidence for the truth of core moral beliefs? Unfortunately, it is far\nfrom clear what that evidence would be unless it includes the truth of\nsome of the very core beliefs whose nature we are trying to explain,\napparently rendering the explanation circular. In sum, the commonsense\nstory of why we have the core moral beliefs that we do is inferior to\nthe simpler, clearer, and non-question-begging Darwinian\nexplanation.\n\n\nAn immediate difficulty with this debunking argument is that it\nassumes that moral beliefs are not about moral properties that are\nalso natural properties and hence are empirically knowable and can\ninteract causally with other natural properties (compare Sturgeon\u2019s\nreply to Harman in Sturgeon 1985; see also Campbell 1996, on\nRuse). Consideration of moral naturalism, that is, opens up the\npossibility that those of our ancestors who tended to respond\npositively to moral properties had an advantage in survival and\nreproduction, because these properties are causally connected with\nmutual well-being. There are many forms of moral naturalism that allow\nthis approach to the compatibility of moral truth and Darwinian moral\nevolution (Brandt 1979; Sturgeon 1985; Railton 1986; Boyd 1988;\nBrink 1989; Copp 1995, 2008; Churchland 1998, 2000; Sober and\nWilson 1998; Rottschaefer 1998; Casebeer 2003; de Waal 2006;\nCampbell 1998, 2009; Kumar 2017). Though the success of such theories depends on\nthe details, they cannot be dismissed on the ground of parsimony,\nsince moral truths would not presuppose properties of a special or\nnon-natural kind. While the truths might be viewed as suspect in other\nrespects, for example, they would be both normative and natural\n(Joyce 2006), we have already addressed such worries in the\nsub-section 3.3 on moral naturalism. They are not new problems\noccasioned by evolutionary theory. Finally, there is no special\nepistemic problem of circularity when it comes to understanding\nevidence for such a theory, other than what we have already discussed\nin 3.3. In short, the debunking evolutionary argument from parsimony,\nclarity, and non-circularity is by itself no threat to moral\nnaturalism.\n4.2 The Debunking Argument from Moral Objectivism\n\n\nIn the past decade a new style of evolutionary debunking argument has\nemerged that pits moral objectivism against the Darwinian origins of\nmorals. While moral naturalism in some forms may not be at odds with\nunderstanding core moral beliefs as having a biological basis, such\nbeliefs, it is argued, cannot embody objective moral knowledge in a\nrobust sense. We must in effect choose between the Darwinian\nexplanation and fully objective moral knowledge. Sharon Street (2006)\npresses this dilemma with careful attention to possible replies. She\nacknowledges that the kind of moral naturalism advanced by Peter\nRailton (1986) is compatible with the evolutionary basis of our core\nmoral beliefs but argues that the price of embracing such naturalism\nis to give up thinking of moral truths as having the kind of objective\nstatus that moral philosophers often attribute to them. She is happy\nto pay that price, but others have contended that the assumption of\nobjectivity, in particular moral realism, is built into how moral\nknowledge is commonly understood (Mackie 1977, Joyce 2006).For the\nlatter group the dilemma presents an attack on the existence of moral\nknowledge, as most of us understand the concept. Since the aim of this\nessay is to review the issues concerning whether genuine moral\nknowledge is possible, we need to assess the merits of this debunking\nargument, paying close attention to how the ideal of objectivity is\nunderstood in this context.\n\n\nExactly what does the required objectivity consist in? Street,\nfollowing Russ Shafer-Landau (2003, p. 15), says that a moral truth\n(or fact) is objective in the sense required by morality when it is\n\u201cstance-independent,\u201d when, that is, it would hold independently of all\nour evaluative attitudes, taken collectively, whether we have them now\nor would have them on reflection under ideal conditions. Evaluative\nattitudes include \u201cdesires, attitudes of approval or disapproval,\nunreflective evaluative tendencies such as the tendency to experience\nX as counting in favor of or demanding Y, and consciously or\nunconsciously held evaluative judgments, such as judgments about what\nis a reason for what, about what one should do or ought to do, about\nwhat is good, valuable, or worthwhile, about what is morally right or\nwrong, and so on\u201d (Street 2006, p. 110). An implication of this\nunderstanding of objectivity, as Street points out, is that it cannot\nbe the case that what we now take to be moral truths or facts are\nobjective in the required sense but could have been different, and\nstill objectively true or factual, if humans had evolved\ndifferently. For example, the following cannot be objectively true: in\ngeneral people are not morally required to sacrifice themselves for\nthe entire community, but they would have been so required if we had\nevolved more on the model of social insects. If moral truths or facts\nwere contingent on evolution in this way (as they would be, to give\nanother example, if moral facts were identified with facts about which\nmoral values would favor diversity in the human gene pool, Wilson\n1978, p. 205), they could not be objective in the strict way demanded\nby Shafer-Landau. (See also Kahane 2011, on the role of moral\nobjectivism in debunking morals.)\n\n\nThere are two ways to go if one wishes to defend the possibility of\nmoral knowledge against the argument from moral objectivism. One is to\nreject the concept of stance-independent objectivity as a necessary\ncondition on moral truth. Studies show that even young children after\na certain age make an intuitive distinction between conventional\ndemands and moral demands (Nichols 2004). Basic moral demands unlike\nconventional ones are taken to be independent of authority (for\nexample, that of a teacher in a classroom) and to be independent of\ntime and place (to apply universally to all persons). These features\nappear to capture at least part of what it is for a moral demand to be\nobjective. Note, however, that these features are not enough to\nguarantee stance-independence. For example, physical pain, considered\njust in itself, is plausibly considered to be universally bad for the\nperson experiencing it, apart from what any authority might decree,\nyet this moral truth is arguably not stance-independent. Why? An\nessential part of what constitutes the experience of physical pain is\nto have a sensation towards which one has a negative evaluative\nresponse. This last part of the experience is what makes it bad for\nthe person suffering pain. But then, its being intrinsically bad is a\ntruth that is stance-dependent. If this argument is sound, we\nmust accept moral skepticism about the objective badness of pain for\nthe person suffering it or else understand the intrinsic badness of\npain for the person who has it not to be objective in this strong\nsense. (Street offers a more complex argument to the same conclusion:\nStreet 2006, pp. 144\u201352.) Given this dilemma a possible line of\ndefense is to argue that in light of such examples the objectivity of\nmoral truth does not entail stance-independence.\n\n\nThe other option is to meet the challenge head-on and argue in the\ncase of a particular moral theory that core moral truths in this\ntheory would be stance-independent and also compatible with the\nDarwinian evolution of morals. David Copp (2008) pursues this course\nof argument using his society-centered moral theory sketched\nearlier. He argues that because moral truth on his theory concerns the\nneeds of human society, one can expect that under propitious\nconditions the more biologically fit moral inclinations would tend to\ntrack (or \u201cquasi-track,\u201d his term) certain core moral truths. Copp\u2019s\nargument is complex, but it presents a possible avenue of defense that\nis worth consideration.\n4.3 The Debunking Argument from the Irrationality of Moral Emotions\n\n\nThe third line of thinking that puts the evolution of morals at\nloggerheads with moral knowledge arises from recent developments in\nmoral psychology and neurobiology. In the past decade several\nprominent psychologists have applied the emerging dual process model\nof the brain to design experiments to reveal how we process moral\njudgments (Greene 2008, 2010 (Other Internet Resources), 2013; Haidt\n2001; Cushman et al. 2006). One type of thinking (system 1)\nis fast, unconscious, automatic, intuitive, and guided by\nemotions. The other (system 2) is slow, conscious, deliberate,\nreflective, and devoid of emotion. Though there remains considerable\ncontroversy about the details (Berker 2009; Greene 2010 (Other\nInternet Resources), 2013), various experiments, including fMRI brain\nstudies, suggest that deontological moral judgment, where one assesses\nthe moral acceptability of actions apart from their consequences, is\nguided solely by system 1 thinking while consequentialist moral\njudgment engages system 2. Since processing in the latter case is\nunemotional, entailing reasoned comparison of possible consequences,\nonly consequentialist thought is properly associated with the rational\nmoral appraisal of actions. Notably, the latter thinking is regarded\nas less primitive from an evolutionary standpoint. By contrast, system\n1 thinking, being tied to intuitive emotional judgments, represents an\nadaptation that was once useful but has by now largely lost its point\ngiven the challenges of life in modern technological society (Greene\n2008, 2010 (Other Internet Resources), 2013; but see\nGigerenzer 2008 and Railton 2014 for a contrary perspective on\nintuitive moral judgments). These claims, when taken together, form\nthe basis of a psychological/evolutionary argument to debunk\ndeontological moral thinking as unreliable and irrational.\n\n\nThe story taken just this far, whatever its merits, appears to allow\nthe possibility of moral knowledge grounded in consequentialist\nreasoning. All the data used to draw negative conclusions about\ndeontological moral thought, however, can be interpreted to support a\nbroader debunking argument, since consequentialist thinking requires\nnot only reasoned calculation of the probable effects of alternative\nactions, but also judgment about whether these effects are good or bad\n(Kahane 2011, pp. 119\u201320). In the latter respect, system 1 would play\nan essential role. If system 1 contaminates the rationality of\ndeontological judgments, given its emotional and primitive\nevolutionary nature, the possibility of consequentialist moral\nknowledge would be undermined in the same way. Though one might reply\nthat moral beliefs formed by thinking about the consequences of\nactions arise in part from reasoning, the core part of the belief,\nconcerning whether the consequences are on the whole good or bad, is\nnot itself rational but emotional (following the logic of the\nargument) and hence cannot qualify as rationally justified, as it\nwould need to be in order to qualify as moral knowledge. In effect,\nthe possibility of moral knowledge is foreclosed no matter what kind\nof moral belief is in question. (See Kahane 2011, for a careful\nelaboration and evaluation of the ensuring global normative\nskepticism.)\n\n\nThough the question of whether the data support a dual process theory\nof brain activity and whether moral thinking divides up in the way\ndescribed is hotly debated, a larger and equally serious problem\nconcerns the assumed opposition between emotional and rational\nthinking. Many experimental studies of practical reasoning yield the\nopposite conclusion, namely, that emotional processing of information\nplays an essential role in prudential reasoning (de Sousa 1987;\nDamasio 1994; Woodward and Allman 2007; Bloom 2013; Railton\n2014). Emotional processing is especially important when the relevant\nvariables are too many and too complex to process entirely through\nconscious reasoning, so that rational thinking and rational behavior\ndepend on the emotional capacity to feel one\u2019s way through practical\nproblems. There is no principled reason why the same would not be true\nin complex practical deliberation about moral issues (Allman and\nWoodward 2008). Research in this regard has only begun, but even now\nit is questionable to assume without argument that the reason-emotion\ndichotomy presupposed in the third type of debunking argument is\ntrustworthy enough to rule out moral knowledge, even if all moral\njudgments have the emotional basis claimed.\n\n\nRecent developments regarding moral consistency reasoning underline\nthe role of emotion in moral reasoning (Campbell and Kumar 2012,\n2013; Kumar and Campbell 2012, 2016; Campbell 2014, 2017 see also Wong 2002 on\nanalogical moral reasoning). Return to Singer\u2019s example of a man\nseeing a toddler about to drown in a shallow pond and knowing that the\nonly cost of saving her life would be ruining his new suit. One can be\nexpected to have feelings of strong disapproval toward anyone who did\nnot try to save a child in any similar situation. Suppose, however,\nthere is another situation, say one in which someone\u2019s life is at\nstake and that person can be saved at no more cost than losing a new\nsuit, say by giving funds for famine relief. If one does not feel as\nbefore about this new situation, then there should be a moral\ndifference between them to explain the difference in emotional\nresponse, or else one is being morally inconsistent in one\u2019s moral\nemotions. Moreover, this kind of moral inconsistency is morally\nculpable, revealing one not to be fully morally trustworthy as a moral\nagent. Singer argues, in fact, that one\u2019s response to the opportunity\nto provide funds for famine relief (at least equivalent to the cost of\na new suit) ought to be the same as in the pond case, since (he\nclaims) there is no morally relevant difference. (He considers various\ncandidates for difference but argues that thinking they are morally\nrelevant results in further inconsistencies depending on the\ncandidate.) When there are no relevant moral differences between two\nsituations and the moral import of one\u2019s response to them is\ndifferent, both responses cannot be morally justified. Though Singer\u2019s\nfocus is on whether one\u2019s moral obligation is the same, the logic of\nhis argument would be the same whether the inconsistency is between\nmoral beliefs or moral emotions. In general we are expected to be\nmorally consistent in our moral beliefs and in our moral emotions.\n\n\nSometimes moral beliefs and moral emotions can diverge, yet it can be\nrational to trust the moral emotion rather than the moral belief. In\nSection 3 we discussed the hybrid conception of moral judgment that\nallows for this kind of separation of belief and emotion. One of the\nexamples was that of a woman who feels strong moral resentment at\nhaving been passed over for promotion in favour of someone whose\nperformance was inferior to hers. It is possible that she doesn\u2019t\nbelieve that she has been wronged, perhaps because she believes the\nman performed better and her feelings are not trustworthy. Suppose\nthat her resentment persists, despite her efforts to ignore it. Must\nher moral emotion then be irrational? Imagine that she feels\nresentment because in fact she can recognize no morally relevant\ndifference between her case and that of the other that would explain\nwhy she wasn\u2019t promoted. Even if she does not at first consciously\nthink about it in this way, her resentment can arise because her\nemotions have been attuned to respond to other cases where a promotion\nhas been granted unfairly and where in retrospect there is no doubt in\nanyone\u2019s mind (like the pond case) what would have been the right\nthing to do. In short, her moral emotion may be rationally grounded,\nif there exists no morally relevant difference between her situation\nand one in which the morally right response is not in doubt from\nanyone\u2019s perspective but is contrary to the decision made in her\ncase.\n\n\nThe idea that emotion may enter unconsciously into good reasoning and\nyield a moral emotion that has a better rational basis than a person\u2019s\nconsciously held beliefs may seem surprising. However, there is a\ngrowing literature in cognitive science over the past decade that\nsupports the cognitive sophistication of our affective system that\noperates largely unconsciously in practical decision-making. For an\nilluminating review of these developments that links insights of\nAristotle and Kant to the unconscious cognitive work done by our\nevolved system of \u201caffective attunement\u201d, see Railton 2014. The lesson\nis not that belief and emotion do not generally cohere in moral\njudgment, but that emotion is itself cognitively complex and can make\nits own independent and rationally based contribution to moral\njudgment.\n5. Methodological: Epistemology Naturalized, Reflective Equilibrium, Rational Choice, and Pragmatic Naturalism\n\n\nThus far we have not addressed directly the question of methodology in\nlooking at the question whether moral knowledge is possible. In the\npast several decades, however, four new methodologies have gained\nprominence and the import of each for the possibility of moral\nknowledge has been widely debated. Some who support the movement to\nnaturalize epistemology, for example, endorse the possibility of moral\nknowledge; others do not. Either way, the new philosophical\nmethodology contained in the movement raises new issues for moral\nepistemology to resolve.\n5.1 Epistemology Naturalized\n\n\nWhat is this new methodology? Quine, who introduced naturalized\nepistemology five decades ago (Quine 1969a), urges epistemologists to\nrenounce the project of explaining knowledge a priori, from first\nprinciples, thus independently of science. The traditional approach to\nknowledge had been to reason about the possibility of knowledge and\nabout the kinds of things that can be known without assuming from the\noutset that we already possess considerable knowledge through science.\nEven the classical empiricists, who argued that knowledge derives\nultimately from sense experience, defended this perspective without\nrelying primarily on scientific theories to establish their\nconclusions. Hume, in particular, was led to a skeptical conclusion\nregarding the possibility of justifying the methods used in reasoning\nfrom experience. He thought any justification of inductive reasoning\nthat uses such reasoning would be circular (Hume, An Enquiry\nConcerning Human Understanding, Book I, Sections IV-V). Quine,\nhowever, dismisses such circularity as a problem for two reasons.\nFirst, the prospect of reasoning independently of all empirical\nassumptions is a will-o-the-wisp, and second, the most troubling source\nof skepticism arises from the present scientific understanding of how\nperception works and hence should be resolved by science itself. Thus,\nQuine advocates that epistemology be carried out within science.\n\n\nThough this suggestion is highly controversial and not all who\nfollow Quine\u2019s lead are prepared to endorse the radical form of\nnaturalized epistemology in which epistemology becomes part of science,\nthe idea of enlisting science in the task of understanding how\nknowledge is possible has gained wide acceptance (Kornblith 1994). We\nneed to consider, then, what the implications are for moral\nepistemology in particular. Does naturalized epistemology logically\nentail moral naturalism? In fact, their relationship is more complex.\nIt is possible to accept the former but reject the latter without\nevident contradiction. Many philosophers who are attracted to\nnaturalized epistemology believe that the natural world is morally\nneutral in itself. From their standpoint the project of naturalizing\nepistemology is only to understand how non-moral knowledge is possible\nby drawing on the resources of science. Quine himself is in this\ncategory. On the other hand, it is possible to believe that moral\nproperties are natural properties but hold that the principles of\nreasoning that allow one to reach this conclusion are not themselves to\nbe explained by science. It is one thing to think, for example, that\nacting rightly is the same as maximizing pleasure over pain; it is\nquite another to think that science can tell us whether these\nproperties of actions are at bottom the same.\n\n\nNevertheless, while naturalized epistemology and moral naturalism\nare logically distinct, it is arguable that anyone who subscribes to\nnaturalized epistemology and believes that moral knowledge is possible\nshould be a moral naturalist. For if moral knowledge is part of\nknowledge and all knowledge is to be explained within science, then\nmoral knowledge itself must be explainable within science, and that\nwould be possible, it would seem, only if moral properties were natural\nproperties that we learn to identify empirically. There exist, however,\nseveral major problems for anyone who endorses both moral naturalism\nand naturalized epistemology, at least in the radical form advocated by\nQuine. The reason is that the strategies that seem promising for\naddressing standard objections to naturalized epistemology are in\ntension with the possibility of moral knowledge. Consideration of two\nstandard objections shows how strategies for coping with them can lead\nto difficulty.\n5.1.1 Losing the normative dimension of moral knowledge\n\n\nOne standard objection to including epistemology within science is\nthat science is committed to providing only an adequate description of\nthe natural world and cannot tell us the world ought to be.\nEpistemology, in marked contrast, is a normative enterprise. It is\nsupposed to tell us how we ought to reason from evidence and\nhow we ought to justify our beliefs, not merely tell us how we\ndo reason or how we do go about justifying them. By\nincluding epistemology within science, therefore, we rob it of\nnormative content that is essential to its being epistemology (Kim\n1988). A promising reply is to dispute the assumption that science is\nmerely a descriptive enterprise, lacking in any normative content. It\nmay be argued that in science the normative and the descriptive are\nboth present. Not only are normative assumptions implicit in scientific\npractice, but these assumptions can be the subject of intense debate\nand reflection within science. Indeed, any adequate description of\nscientific practice bears out this sociological observation. The\nobjection rests on a false premise (Campbell 1998).\n\n\nThe problem is to work out this line of reply for naturalized moral\nepistemology. What is often a matter of intense debate is what\nstandards of evidence are appropriate for testing a certain type of\ntheory. Normative concerns are present in the form of worries about\nepistemic standards, such as the role of statistical significance in\npsychological experiments. But epistemic standards are not moral\nstandards. To develop a parallel defense to the charge that the moral\ndimension is missing from naturalized moral epistemology, we would have\nto argue that moral values are operating in science and further that we\ncan decide which moral values are appropriate for science through\nscientific debate. Many would agree that moral values, such as honesty,\ntrust, and loyalty, do operate in science, but not many are prepared to\nconcede that matters critical to moral epistemology can be decided by\nthe methods of science. Can science tell us, for example, how we would\nknow when honesty should be sacrificed for the sake of loyalty?\n\n\nIn the face of this challenge it may be tempting for a believer in\nthe possibility of moral knowledge simply to reject the project of\nnaturalizing moral epistemology. An immediate difficulty in taking this\nway out is the close connection between this project and moral\nnaturalism, together with the role that the latter theory plays in\naddressing the ontological problems raised in section 3. Earlier\nwe noted how the naturalizing project in moral epistemology can lead a\nbeliever in moral knowledge toward moral naturalism. The reverse is\nalso true for a person who accepts a naturalized epistemology for\nnon-moral knowledge. If such a person thinks that moral features of the\nworld can be found among its natural properties and that these\nproperties can be investigated empirically, she will have a hard time\nexplaining why science is incapable of explaining what these moral\nproperties are and how we can know them. In sum, we may need moral\nnaturalism to address the ontological problems for moral knowledge, but\nthen we are led to a naturalized moral epistemology and to the\nchallenge now before us.\n\n\nOne source of resistance to moral epistemology being part of science\nmay be the picture of scientists trying to decide moral questions by\nreference to graphs, lab reports, and print-outs from machines, as if\nthe answer to moral questions might be read off of data sheets. We have\nalready noted that his picture of scientific practice is excessively\nnarrow. It fails to reflect the fact that scientists debate the\nimplications of their data and debate the merits of the epistemic\nstandards used in their debates. The key issue then is whether it is\npossible to draw a line between these debates and moral ones and to\ndeclare moral debates to lie outside of science proper. Although Quine\napparently thought this possible, his holistic approach to matters of\nevidence suggests otherwise. If moral beliefs have truth-value, as\nmoral naturalism implies, then the \u201cweb of belief\u201d to which Quine often\nalludes would include moral beliefs (White 1986, Jack Nelson 1996).\nRecall that a moral naturalist will invoke moral facts to explain\ncertain non-moral facts, for example, the fact that American chattel\nslavery was so morally repugnant to explain, in part, the extent of the\nresistance to it at the time of the American civil war (Sturgeon 1985).\nIf this kind of interaction between the moral and the non-moral is on\nthe cards, it would be odd to preclude moral questions a priori from\nscientific discussion.\n\n\nA number of recent articles and books have defended a holistic\napproach to the place of moral value within scientific and other\nempirical investigations, recognizing moral claims as being\nepistemically interdependent with claims about non-moral facts (White\n1981, Sturgeon 1985, Miller 1992, Lynn Nelson 1996, Rottschaefer 1998,\nCampbell 1998). Though a review of that literature is beyond the scope\nof this essay, it is worth stressing that this conception of science is\nnot widely held and that if it were generally accepted by scientists,\nthen the practice of science would change significantly. The position\nthat is entertained here in response to the last difficulty is not that\ncurrent science routinely and effectively engages in moral discussion,\nmuch less that current science provides a model for such discussion.\nThe point is that there may be no principled reason to exclude this\npossibility for the future direction of science and that there may be\nprincipled reasons to allow it, given the epistemological implications\nof moral naturalism.\n5.1.2 Global skepticism and the problem of circularity\n\n\nA second standard objection to naturalized epistemology is that it\ngives up the project of answering the global skeptic and as a\nconsequence fails to address, much less resolve, a central issue in\nepistemology. It must surrender this project because by operating\nwithin science it assumes that we already have some knowledge and hence\nbegs the question against the global skeptic. For example, Quine\nappeals to Darwin to explain why our native inductive tendencies (used\nsay in tracking the location of middle-sized objects moving in our\nimmediate vicinity) must do better than chance in getting the right\nanswer or else the tendencies would have been selected against long ago\n(Quine 1969b). Yet in assuming that we have good inductive grounds to\nbelieve Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, we justify induction by assuming\nthat it is justified and thereby reason in a circle.\n\n\nTwo kinds of replies to this objection are worth considering. The\nfirst, suggested in the brief statement of Quine\u2019s new methodology, is\nto reject the old problem as based on the false presupposition that one\ncan vindicate scientific and other knowledge on the basis of\npropositions that are knowable a priori. The difficulty with this\nresponse is that it raises the difficult issues of whether a priori\nknowledge is possible and whether we can determine an answer to that\nquestion a posteriori. Another reply, perhaps more in keeping with the\nspirit of naturalized epistemology, is not to dismiss global skepticism\nout of hand, but to allow science to attempt to explain science within\nits own terms, recognizing that the effort will be circular but\ndefending its legitimacy. The effort is legitimate, it might be argued,\nbecause the circularity does not guarantee the success of the effort.\nThe appeal to Darwin, for example, may not succeed, either because\nDarwin\u2019s theory is overthrown or because a necessary background\nassumption (say that our native inductive tendencies are gene linked)\nis contradicted by the evidence. In fact, Quine allowed that the\nproject to explain science from within science could defeat itself, in\nthe end vindicating the skeptic (Quine 1981, p. 22). On this approach\nknowledge claims are always open to questioning and perhaps rejection\ndown the road. Any justification that is offered for induction or\nclaims of knowledge based on induction is ultimately fallible and\nrevisable.\n\n\nCan this kind of answer to the circularity charge be extended to\nnaturalized moral epistemology? Can we offer the moral skeptic the same\nkind of reply? It may be that we cannot, since the two cases appear to\nbe importantly different. While we may consider global skepticism an\ninteresting theoretical challenge, few of us feel the need to address\nit before getting on with our lives. We may be content to follow the\nadvice that we assume that we already know many things and then (if we\nare so inclined) attempt to explain how we know so much, relying on\nwhat we already think we know. With moral skepticism the situation\nappears different. Most of us are far more prone to doubt the\npossibility of moral knowledge than we are to question whether we know\nanything at all. Moral doubts affect our confidence in making daily\nmoral decisions. Thus, to follow the former advice and assume for now\nthat we know what we believe we know in order to justify our decisions\nmay seem to be illegitimately circular. The need for justification is\nmore pressing in the moral case; hence, the methodology of justifying\nour moral beliefs by allowing ourselves to believe about moral matters\nwhat we have been raised to believe is more questionable (Campbell and\nHunter 2000).\n\n\nThe defender of naturalized moral epistemology can reply that\nhowever urgent justification may be, no alternative exists to relying\non background assumptions when we try to justify specific claims. At\ntimes the justification of non-moral knowledge claims can be similarly\nurgent, as in deciding political, economic, or environmental policy.\nWhat is in doubt need not be the moral importance of, for example,\npreventing certain harms, but rather the means to achieve this end. In\nthese cases we will seek statistical and other evidence to support our\nbeliefs, but there exists now a firm consensus among philosophers of\nscience that the justification provided by evidence for a hypothesis\nwill depend for its credibility on theoretical background assumptions.\nThese in turn may require defense, but in general there is no way to\nproceed but to assume something that we think we know until we have\nsufficient reason to reject the assumption. In this respect, the\ndefender of naturalized epistemology can say that moral knowledge and\nnon-moral knowledge are on a par. This response is of a piece with the\nreply to the last challenge in that it appeals to the holistic nature\nof justification. Unless this appeal is blocked somehow, moral\nknowledge remains a viable possibility when moral epistemology is\nnaturalized.\n5.2 Reflective Equilibrium and Rational Choice\n\n\nTwo allied methodologies need to be mentioned that arose along side\nof naturalized epistemology in the last century. Goodman introduced the\nconcept of a reflective equilibrium in addressing the problem of\njustifying induction (Goodman 1955). Rules of inference would be\nformulated to explain what one takes to be valid scientific reasoning,\nmuch as one might formulate deductive inference rules to explain valid\ninferences of mathematicians. Application of these rules may, however,\nyield conclusions that are contrary to one\u2019s considered judgment in a\ngiven case. Then a choice is necessary between revising one\u2019s judgment\nto bring it into line with the systematic implications of the other\nspecific judgments, or else revising the rules (with the possible\nconsequence that a similar problem will arise in another quarter). One\nproceeds until reaching (for the time being) a reflective equilibrium\nin considered judgments, including judgments about the rules that best\nexplain one\u2019s inferences. The proposed methodology is like that of\nnaturalized epistemology. It begins by taking for granted, at least\ninitially, that the methods of science are sound and then attempts to\nformulate the principles that explain it by working within science,\nrevising the principles or the practice as necessary to achieve a more\ncoherent overall understanding. A significant difference is that the\nmethod seeks explicitly to arrive at acceptable normative\nprinciples.\n\n\nRawls self-consciously applies the concept of reflective equilibrium\nin explaining the method of justification underlying his theory of\nsocial justice (Rawls 1971). Rawls applies the methodology, of course,\nto justify considered moral judgments found outside of science.\nHowever, he takes no judgments to be established simply a priori. The\nclaims about justice are justified in part by their implications when\ntaken together with what we assume to be known in psychological,\nsocial, and economic theory. Others have elaborated this methodology\nso that a \u201cwide reflective equilibrium\u201d would be reached\nonly after consideration of relevant background assumptions, regarding\nsuch things as personal identity and rational choice, as well as\nrelevant alternative theories (Daniels 1976). Still others argue that\nwide reflective equilibrium reasoning should not be confused with a\ndifferent but complementary reasoning that directly compares opposing\nmoral judgments about particular but similar cases without reference\nto general principles. Moral consistency reasoning, as it is called,\ncan support but it can also undermine wide reflective equilibrium\nreasoning. Both may be needed to reach morally defensible conclusions\n(Campbell 2014).\n\n\nA complication is that the justification of moral claims in Rawls\nproceeds also by arguing that rational persons in a hypothetical\n\u201coriginal position\u201d of freedom and equality would be rational to choose\ncertain principles of social justice. Though in this appeal to rational\nchoice Rawls is explicitly engaged in a social contract theory of\njustice and thus a particular type of normative theory, the\nimplications are more general. The larger suggestion is that moral\ntruth is based significantly on which moral norms can be rationally\nchosen by members of a given society as norms under which they would be\nprepared to live. (Compare the accounts of moral truth in Brandt 1979,\nCopp 1995, and Braybrooke 2001, none of which defend social contract\ntheory, but all of which base moral truth on rational choice. Gauthier\n1986 appeals to rational choice to determine which moral norms are\njustified but without supposing that moral judgments have truth\nvalue.)\n\n\nThe methodology of basing moral truth on rational choice and the\nmethodology of invoking the ideal of a reflective equilibrium of\nconsidered judgments both endeavor to square moral knowledge with a\nscientific world view and as such are allied with naturalized\nepistemology. Both, however, explicitly make room for normative claims\nand so avoid the charge that the normative dimension is missing from\ntheir account of moral knowledge. Unfortunately they face the charge of\nmaking moral truth more likely than not to reflect the moral status quo.\nLet us allow that a person may come to revise many beliefs, including\nmany moral beliefs, before reaching a wide reflective equilibrium in\njudgments. Why should we think that the most stubborn moral judgments\nin a given reflective equilibrium are more likely to be true than the\nones that gave way to them in the process of reaching a reflective\nequilibrium (Copp 1985)? The reply may be that this approach is no\nworse off than naturalized epistemology, since we must take some moral\nclaims for granted, at least tentatively, and proceed until there is\nreason to revise our judgments given their lack of fit with everything\nelse we think we know. Moral conservatism is also a problem for the\nmethodology that bases moral truth on rational choice, since rational\nchoice turns on individual preferences and these are inevitably shaped\nby the moral status quo (Babbitt 1996 and Campbell 1998).\n5.3 Pragmatic Naturalism\n\n\nBuilding on the pioneering work of American pragmatists, notably\nWilliam James (James 1907) and John Dewey (Dewey 1922; Dewey &\nTufts 1932), Philip Kitcher (Kitcher 2011a) has recently revitalized\nthe pragmatic, naturalistic approach to moral knowledge evident in\nearlier thinkers. (For his general defence of pragmatism, see his\npapers in Kitcher 2012.) Like naturalized epistemology,\n\u201cpragmatic naturalism\u201d, to use his term, eschews appeal to\na priori knowledge but also rejects the ideal of moral knowledge of a\nreality to be discovered in nature that is static and not under human\ncontrol. Pragmatic naturalism is thus distinct from ontological\nnaturalism already discussed above in 3.3. Though principles of\nrational choice can play a role in moral learning on this view, all\nprinciples are open to revision and, more importantly, grounds for\nmoral change need not appeal to a reflective equilibrium of principles\nand judgments. Instead, moral knowledge is part of a long cultural\nevolutionary process of humans working out among themselves how they\ncan live together, initially in small groups, through imposing\nconstraints on their interactions and setting goals consistent with\nthem that they can strive toward collectively. Moral knowledge is\nmoral \u201cknow-how\u201d that emerges first out of primitive tendencies\nfashioned by natural selection and from cooperative efforts within\ngroups to live peacefully while competing for resources with other\ngroups. Alliances between groups form when necessary and in some cases\ncodes of conduct apply to allied groups. Humans achieve moral\nprogress, not by discovering truth that exists apart from their\nsocieties, but by fulfilling the various functions of ethical norms as\nthese functions gradually emerge through engagement in \u201cthe ethical\nproject\u201d.\n\n\nSuch pragmatic naturalism, as moral epistemology, has strong\naffinities with the methodologies just canvassed and shares many of\ntheir virtues. For example, when discussing cases of moral progress,\nsuch as the abolition of slavery in the United States and improvement\nover the last century in civil status of women in Europe and the\nUnited States, Kitcher focuses on the reasons for moral change that\nwere in fact operating in these cases rather than on principles that\nmight rationalize the changes without necessarily explaining\nthem. Like naturalized epistemology the focus is on looking for the\nreasons that are also causes. Like reflective equilibrium theory and\nrational choice theory, the focus is sensitive to tensions within\nmoral perspectives both theoretical and practical, such as the\napparent contradiction of maintaining the view that women as wives and\nmothers should not be educated while having to concede, as Mary\nWollstonecraft argued (Kitcher 2011a, 148\u201350), that they would better\nfulfill their role in their families if they were educated or, as John\nWoolman pointed out (Kitcher 2011a, 158\u201361), maintaining a Christian\nview of the equal worth of every human while tolerating chattel\nslavery. Kitcher\u2019s argument in these and similar cases is that\nimprovement in moral knowledge was not achieved through the use of\ngeneral abstract principles but has depended instead on reconciling\nconflicts of moral values so that their emerging functions are better\nserved. See also Elizabeth Anderson\u2019s discussion of how people learned\nthat slavery is wrong (Anderson 2016). At the same time,\nbecause pragmatists, such as Kitcher and Anderson, focus on cases of\nradical moral change from the status quo, the charge of moral\nconservatism that faces reflective equilibrium and rational choices\ntheories of moral knowledge tends to be undercut.\n\n\nWe have to ask, however, whether pragmatic naturalism is a method that\nyields genuine moral knowledge, since it seems to replace reference to\nknowledge of moral truth with knowledge of the practical means for\nresolving human conflict. Are not the two very different? Is not this\npragmatic understanding of moral knowledge, for all its virtues, an\nimpostor that really fails to signify something that has the\ntranscendent moral authority that we intuitively associate with\ngenuine moral truth? There is ample experimental work confirming that\nall of us, including children, are able to distinguish conventional\nauthority from moral authority, where the latter is understood to take\nprecedence over what is claimed to be right by those in positions of\nauthority within a society or what current norms viewed as\nauthoritative are thought to imply (Nichols 2004). If that were not\nso, it would have made no sense for advocates of moral change to hold\nthat conventional moral authority was violating the moral rights of\nhumans treated as property or unworthy of education. Kitcher tries to\naddress this problem by arguing that pragmatic naturalism allows a\nrobust conception of moral truth but one that is not prior to our\nunderstanding of moral progress (Kitcher 2011a, 245\u20139). Another way to\naddress the problem would be to conceive of moral truth so that it\ndoes not imply a realist conception of moral truth but one that is\nrobustly objective in that it allows the possibility of massive moral\nerror among would-be knowers despite all efforts to know the truth\n(Campbell & Kumar 2013). Truth has been a central concern to\npragmatism from its inception (Misak 2013) and the problem of moral\ntruth bears critically on the viability of pragmatic naturalism as a\nmethodology for understanding the possibility of moral knowledge.\n6. Moral: Feminist Epistemology and the Bias Paradox\n\n\nAnother relatively recent development in epistemology is the\nmovement to view epistemology from the perspective of feminism (Jaggar\n1983 and 1989, Code 1991, Anderson 1995, Alcoff 1996). The growth of\ninterest in this approach to epistemology is exceeded only by that in\nnaturalizing epistemology and at times the two perspectives are engaged\nsimultaneously (Antony 1993, Duran 1994, Nelson 1990 and 1996, Nelson\nand Nelson 1996, Campbell 1998 and 2003). At first glance the prospect of a\nfeminist epistemology may appear to be a contradiction in terms.\nFeminism is a political movement aimed at eliminating the subordination\nof women to men, while the goal of epistemology is to establish and\ndefend, from a disinterested and impartial point of view, systematic\nstandards for knowledge or justified belief. How can a political\nmovement that is partial regarding the interests of women in relation\nto men be disinterested and impartial? The idea of a feminist\nepistemology, not to say a feminist moral epistemology, may therefore\nappear incomprehensible.\n\n\nFeminists have not been slow to recognize this challenge and have made\na variety of replies. (See Harding 1986 and 1995 for a comparative\nstudy.) Postmodern feminists call into question the concepts of\nknowledge, truth, and impartial justification. Others, however, would\nagree with the assumption of this essay that it is possible to have\nnon-moral knowledge and to offer justifications that adequately\nsupport the truth of non-moral beliefs. They maintain that a feminist\nperspective is able to enhance rather than diminish the accuracy of\nnon-moral beliefs. For example, studies of coronary heart disease were\ncarried out for a long time only on men, based on the belief that the\nresults would apply equally well to women (Mastroianni et\nal. 1994, pp.  64\u201366). In fact, significant differences\nexist, but they came to light only after pressures to broaden the\nstudies. It is agreed on all sides, at this point, that the new\nstudies give a more objective picture of the development of coronary\nheart disease in men and women. Notice, though, that this result is\nentirely compatible with the change in the studies being motivated by\ninterest in women\u2019s health. The conclusion to draw is not that\npolitical motivation is necessarily advantageous for achieving more\nreliable theories but rather that it can be.  Moreover, feminist\nmotivations can lead to the discovery of forms of partiality that have\ndistorted the truth and prevented access to relevant evidence. At a\nstill deeper level, feminists who accept the possibility of knowing\nthe truth have argued that epistemology itself can be transformed\nthrough a better understanding of the ways in which partiality can\nincrease or decrease our chances of knowing the truth.  They have\nargued that it is important to understand how partiality can increase\nor decrease the chances of knowing the truth when the truths in\nquestion concern the subordination of women to men.\n\n\nFeminists who accept the concept of truth are motivated, of course,\nnot simply by the desire to discover the truth about the subordination\nof women (what forms it takes, how it comes about, where it has become\npart of the practice of epistemology). They are also motivated by the\ndesire to stop it. This motivation is justified, most feminists would\nsay, by their knowing that the subordination is unjust and hence\nmorally wrong. At this juncture, one may want to ask how such feminist\nepistemology could create a problem for the possibility of moral\nknowledge. It would seem, on the contrary, that epistemology that is so\nmotivated depends for its rationale on moral knowledge.\n\n\nThe problem is that feminist criticism of knowledge claims that\nreinforce injustice extends to claims of moral knowledge. Some\nexamples may help to clarify this point. Some libertarians have taken\nit to be self-evident that each of us owns his or her own body and\nwhatever is produced through its labor, provided that the goods used\nin the labor are freely and justly acquired so that their acquisition\ndoes not leave others worst off than they were prior to the\nacquisition (Nozick 1974).  This premise is a basic building block for\nsome moral and political theories of justice. Okin (1989) argues,\nhowever, that the premise leads to absurdity when one takes into\naccount the power of women to produce humans through their physical\nlabor, using sperm that they may freely and justly acquire through\npurchase without leaving anyone worst off than before. An absurd\nconsequence of the theory would be that women own their children as\nproperty whom they can dispose of at will.  Not only is this result\nmorally absurd, but there is the further consequence that mothers\nbeing the products of mothers both do and do not own themselves. She\nargues that an inconsistency can also be produced for Rawls\u2019 theory of\njustice, since it is so structured that justice does not apply within\nfamilies yet at the same time the theory requires it to apply there in\norder for justice as fairness to be feasible (Okin 1989). In both\ncases Susan Moller Okin, a feminist moral and political philosopher,\nhas criticized the foundations of a theory of justice by arguing that\nits basic premises are gender-biased in ways that reinforce the\nsubordination of women to men. In one case, gender-bias occurs by\nfailing to count reproductive labor as genuine labor, in the other by\nfailing to recognize how injustice within the family is a major force\nin creating and maintaining the subordination of women to men in the\npublic domain. (For discussion of related problems that arise from the\nquest for impartial moral knowledge when it ignores human embodiment,\nsee Walker 1998, Bach 2012, and Babbitt 2014.)\n\n\nIn order to see how feminist critiques of bias in prominent theories\nof justice lead to paradox, recall the feminist rejection of\nimpartiality as an epistemic ideal. As noted, feminist have defended\nthis rejection by noting that partiality can lead to more accurate\naccounts of reality just as it can lead to distortion and\nmisrepresentation. Partiality that is positive in its results, as in\nthe discovery of the different development of coronary heart disease in\nwomen, should not be rejected. In the heart disease example, however,\nit is possible to ascertain the worthiness of the result independently\nof the bias. Whatever led to the broader study of coronary heart\ndisease, the results of the study can be independently verified by\nfeminist and non-feminists alike. Compare partiality in the moral case.\nIs it possible to know that the resulting feminist theories of justice\nare more objective, less distorting in their representations of justice\nthan the theories under criticism? It may be hard to see how the truth\nof the new feminist theory can be recognized independently of the sense\nof justice that motivated the critique. Does the feminist sense of\njustice constitute a partiality that leads to a more objective, less\ndistorting representation of moral reality? That depends on whether the\njustice in question is identifiable independently of the feminist sense\nof justice. If there is no understanding of true justice that is\nindependent of the partiality that motivates the critique of the\ntraditional theory, then the appeal to true justice appears\nquestion-begging and self-serving.\n\n\nWhat seems to have gone wrong is that feminists are in the position\nof rejecting impartiality as a general epistemic and moral ideal, but\nat the same time they want to reject gender bias because it obviously\nfails to measure up to the ideal of impartiality. Louise Antony has\ncalled this inconsistency \u201cthe bias paradox\u201d (Antony 1993). It is a\nparadox or at least has the appearance of one because there are\nprincipled reasons for rejecting the ideal of complete impartiality.\nNot only are there the reasons already given, but evolutionary reasons\nexist as well for rejecting impartiality. Natural selection has\nequipped us with the means to sort through massive amounts of sensory\ninformation so that we can pick out and interpret quickly information\nrelevant to our survival. Without built-in \u201cbiases\u201d of this nature we\ncould not begin to know anything about the world around us. Yet we also\nwant to reject biases that produce a \u201cbiased\u201d (in a pejorative sense,\ni.e., distorted) representation of the truth. Feminists and\nnon-feminists are in a bind, unless a principled way exists to separate\ngood biases from bad ones. Antony suggests that epistemically good\nbiases are ones that lead to finding out the truth, while epistemically\nbad biases lead away from the truth. Although other epistemologists\nhave suggested that good epistemic standards may be distinguished from\nbad ones by how well they lead to finding out the truth, Antony\u2019s\nproposal is more radical, since she allows political biases to have\npositive epistemic status when they are truth-conducive. But she grants\nthat much work remains to be done to make this resolution clear and\ngenerally acceptable.\n\n\nDoes this suggestion help in averting the threat of circularity that\nwe came upon one paragraph back in reviewing feminist moral critiques\nof gender bias in prominent theories of justice? Arguably it does,\nprovided that we understand moral fact as being independent of our\nopinions about it and our procedures for trying to establish it\n(Campbell 2001). That is, the suggestion helps, provided that moral\nfact is understood either in the realist sense of fact (one not\nreducible to what we can agree upon or what our methods would\ndetermine) or in a sense of objective fact that allows for the\npossibility of massive moral error whatever the efforts to the\ncontrary. At this point we may be inclined to ask whether it is\npossible to know such moral facts? We should remind ourselves,\nhowever, that the main reasons to doubt that we can know moral facts\nare precisely the reasons that we have already examined under the\nheadings above. The objections labeled sociological, psychological,\nontological, evolutionary, and methodological are not aimed against\nknowing moral facts in some non-literal sense of fact, but against\nknowing moral facts in the same sense that we appear to know other\nfacts about the world. If the possible replies that we have canvassed\nare adequate responses to these objections, then it is arguable that\nwe may avert the threat of circularity by Antony\u2019s suggested\nresolution.\n\n\nThis result can be generalized, since it would apply to moral\ncriticisms of impartiality that arise because of concerns about racial\nor class bias. (See Thomas 1992\u20133 for a discussion of the\nimportance of moral deference to the testimony of those in oppressed\ngroups.) If the resolution by appeal to realist fact is successful in\naverting circularity and paradox in the case of gender bias, there is\nno reason why it should not succeed in other cases in which an\nepistemic standard is rejected on other moral grounds. Would the\nresolution be relevant to the moral criticism of other epistemic\nstandards? An example in point would be the criticism by feminists and\nnon-feminists of purely individual-based standards of inquiry,\nespecially in science (Longino 1990, Hardwig 1991, Goldman 1999, and\nKitcher 2011b). Some of these critiques are partly moral, since they\nemphasize the need for democratic values and trust in the context of\nscientific inquiry.  Arguably, they are also motivated by the\nperception that the individual-centered modes of inquiry are at a\ndisadvantage in discovering the facts. (On this last point see the\nsections 7\u201310 to follow.) If we accept the proposed resolution of the\nbias paradox, we could argue that the change in epistemic standards is\njustified on both grounds. In the case where the inquiry is moral\nrather than scientific, can we imagine criticism of epistemic\nstandards other than impartiality? An example might be criticism of\nthe individual-based modes of moral inquiry presupposed in\nintuitionism. As before, we would need a strategy to avert circularity\nand paradox. If the strategy is to stick to a realist or sufficiently\nobjective conception of moral fact, its success will depend on whether\nthe problems canvassed above that confront the possibility of such\nmoral knowledge can be resolved.\n7. Moral Knowledge May Be Possible \u2013 But for Whom?\n\n\nWe have addressed six major clusters of problems that threaten the\npossibility of moral knowledge defined as someone having a justified\ntrue moral belief. For each cluster we have noted avenues of\nresolution worth further exploration. Nonetheless, the problems may\nsuggest that our definition of moral knowledge misrepresents the\ninherently social nature of moral knowledge. Developments in the\ninterdisciplinary literature on the evolution and psychology of\nmorality reinforce this worry.\n\n\nThe psychologists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber challenge the\nassumption that complex knowledge resides in the beliefs of rational\nindividuals (Mercier and Sperber 2017). Countless experiments over\nseveral decades have shown us to be on average very bad at reasoning\non our own. One well-known case is the Wason selection test taken by\nthousands of subjects. In one version subjects have in front of them\nfour cards with a number on one side and a letter on the other. They\nare asked which cards that show E, K, 2, or 7 would they turn over to\ndetermine the truth of the following statement: If a vowel is on one\nside there is an even number on the other. On average only 20% get the\nright answer. If they reason together in small groups, however, their\nsuccess rate jumps to 80%. What accounts for this improvement?\n\n\nMost people, including scientists, are subject to \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\nin that they look for data that are consistent with what they think\nmight be true. Thus if they think the statement in the test is true,\nthey might turn over the \u201c2\u201d card, since doing so cannot help but be\nconsistent with the truth of the statement. What people tend not to\nsearch for is something that could disconfirm their hypothesis, such\nas finding out whether there is a vowel on the other side of card\n\u201c7\u201d. The groups that did well on this test turned over only cards \u201cE\u201d\nand \u201c7\u201d, since these are the only cards that could disconfirm the\ntruth of the statement at issue. Mercier and Sperber suggest that the\npsychological dynamics of reasoning in groups guard against\nconfirmation bias. Each member of a group can have an idea how to\nsolve the problem at issue and put it to the group, but others in the\ngroup will tend to look critically at a proposal from someone else to\nsee if the proposal has a flaw. There is in this way a division of\ncognitive labor within the group. While each member may suffer\nconfirmation bias, as well as other biases, the whole group need not,\nsince each member will try to disconfirm solutions offered by\nothers. The upshot is that the group as a whole will tend to do well,\nunless everyone is biased in exactly the same way. The best groups\ncomprise people who are cognitively diverse but listen well to each\nother.\n\n\nIs there a lesson here for resolving moral problems through social\ninteractive reasoning? Mercier and Sperber cite the abolition of\nslavery by the British Parliament in 1834 after some fifty years of\ndebate at all levels of society. Abolitionists were at first in the\nminority. They asked how Christian moral norms of brotherly love and\nequality before God could be reconciled with enslaving Africans. Those\ndefending slavery retorted that Africans were less intelligent and\nlacked integrity, but these claims were contradicted by the eloquence\nand evident moral character of former slaves who addressed public\nmeetings and by Christian witnesses who had known slaves from personal\nexperience. The economic consequences of abolition were also\ndebated. In the end the majority of public opinion changed through\ndiscussions that permitted careful examination of diverse points of\nview from different parts of society over a long enough period to\nestablish credible evidence about the negative consequences of slavery\ncompared to the likely positive effects of its abolition.\n\n\nThis example suggests that, while people may have moral beliefs that\ninitially few others share, free and interactive reasoning in a\ndiverse group can reveal these moral beliefs to be the better\njustified among the alternatives. Many other examples, such as debates\nabout women\u2019\u2019s right to education or their right to vote,\nconvey the same message. The implication is that moral knowledge, to\nthe extent that it is possible, is more likely to be achieved through\ninteractive reasoning among those with diverse viewpoints who are open\nto criticism from each other.\n8. Moral Knowledge Socially Embodied in Emotions\n\n\nThe philosophical movement of social epistemology supports this\nperspective. It understands knowledge to be primarily a social\nachievement (see entry for Social Epistemology). Moral\nknowledge may be still more deeply social than is generally\nrecognized, even among those who grant that justifying moral beliefs\ninvolves a social process of interactive reasoning within a\ncognitively diverse group. When moral consistency reasoning is part of\nthe social justification process, the reasoning entails efforts to\neliminate emotional inconsistencies in thinking (Campbell and Kumar\n2012). In that case moral knowledge, if it were achieved, would be\nembodied not only in the beliefs of those seeking knowledge, but also\nin their motivations and feelings. Indeed, given the cognitive basis\nof moral emotions, it is possible for a society to know through their\nfeelings of guilt that they have done morally wrong even when they\nbelieve otherwise for ideological reasons, parallel to the case of the\nwomen who cannot shake her feelings of resentment for being unfairly\npassed over for promotion in favour of a male colleague when she\nbelieves her feelings cannot justified given the lesser social status\nof women (Campbell 2007).\n9. Epistemological Exclusion\n\n\nNew research on moral evolution accords with the above social view of\nmoral knowledge. Michael Tomasello (2016) makes the case that human\nmoral norms have their origin in the phenomenon of \u201cshared\nintentionality\u201d that binds diverse individuals to a common project in\nwhich they see each other as equal partners. When moral norms conflict\neach person in a group that is motivated by these norms is an equal\npartner in the shared project of resolving the moral conflict. If\nmorality is a shared project in this way, the cost of excluding some\npersons from the process of resolving moral conflict can be\nsignificant. Such exclusion can undermine achieving moral knowledge\nthat depends on input from diverse individuals acting as equals.\n\n\nThis understanding of moral knowledge reflects moral concerns of many\nfeminists. For example, Miranda Fricker (2007) examines the \u201cepistemic\ninjustice\u201d of being wrongfully denied recognition as a potential\nknower due to one\u2019s race, gender, or other identity. See also\nKristie Dotson (2011) on the epistemic injustice of silencing caused\nby violence against women. Other feminists point out that non-moral\nknowledge claims can be unfairly biased when they are based only on\nexperience of men or neglect the social structures that unjustly bias\nthe perception of causation. For example, it is sometimes thought that\nthe burden of childrearing is biologically determined. Sarah Baffer\nHrdy (2009), however, offer a new evolutionary perspective on the\nshared responsibility for childcare among early humans. Cordelia Fine\n(2017) challenges the familiar view that gender roles are hormonally\ndetermined. Kate Manne (2018) shows how patriarchy tends to undermine\nsocially our ability to reason freely about gender\ndiscrimination. Even when reasoning is conceived explicitly as being\nsocial and equal, as in social contract theory, the moral upshot of\nreasoning can reflect racial bias when reasoning is abstracted from\nactual social context (Charles Mills 2017) or when the causal effects\nof social structures, like de facto segregation, are ignored\n(Elizabeth Anderson 2010).\n\n10. The Six Clusters of Problems: Any Progress?\n\n\nHow do these considerations bear on the possibility of moral\nknowledge? In particular, does a group-centered conception of moral\nknowledge that is based on social interactive reasoning help to\naddress the six main clusters of problems raised earlier about the\npossibility of moral knowledge? My answer is positive but\nqualified. Consider the clusters of problems in order.\n\n\nThe first cluster concerns the sociological reality of moral\ndisagreement. Obviously the group-centered conception of moral\nknowledge does not eliminate differences in moral outlook, but it may\nalter how we should think about these differences. I said early on\nthat I would assume that we have knowledge of some non-moral\ntruths. An example would be knowledge that the Earth is round rather\nthan flat. There are pockets of people who still believe that the\nEarth is flat. Should most remain confident in knowing that the Earth\nis round? The reason they should is the social interactive reasoning\nabout the issue over centuries from diverse perspectives leading to\nnear universal agreement. Can a similar conclusion be drawn in certain\nimportant cases of moral agreement, for example, about moral\nprogress?\n\n\nAllen Buchanan and Russell Powell (2018) cite ten examples of moral\nprogress. Among them are these four: \u201c\u2026the large reduction,\nbeginning with the British abolition, of the incidence of the most\nextreme forms of slavery\u2026the increasing recognition and\ninstitutionalization of the equal rights of women in some countries,\nbetter treatment of some non-human animals, abolition of at least the\ncruellest punishments\u201d (p. 47). While not everyone would agree even\nwith these examples, there exists, parallel to the non-moral case,\nextremely broad agreement among diverse groups who have reasoned\nfreely and interactively over extended periods. As Buchanan and Powell\nmake clear, moral progress in such cases goes hand in hand with moral\nregress in many areas and unresolved deep moral differences about\nother issues. On the other hand, if what is in question is the bare\npossibility of moral knowledge, a positive answer seems warranted.\n\n\nThe second, psychological cluster of problems focuses on the dual\nfunction of moral judgment as motivation and belief. The problem is\nhow a judgment can be both at once. A resolution that we examined is\nthat moral judgment can be a hybrid of the two states. That suggestion\nis much easier to defend for moral knowledge when it is embodied in a\ngroup of individuals who have distinct beliefs and motivations. The\ngroup as a whole is motivated by a collection of internalized moral\nnorms that the group believes to be justified. Even if no mental state\nof an individual in a group performs both functions at once, the group\nas a whole can serve both functions of belief and motivation as they\nare differently embodied in the mental states of its members.\n\n\nThe ontological cluster is a different matter. While the subjective\npart of knowledge shifts from individual judgment to the\ninternalization of norms within the group and a reasoned consensus\nthat the norms are justified, the reality that the knowledge is about\nremains a difficult issue: Is moral truth to be treated as\ntheological, non-natural, or natural? There is, however, a subtle\ndifference. The truth in question is about whether the emotionally\nembodied norms can withstand the scrutiny of the whole group under\nsustained interactive reasoning in light of relevant non-moral\nknowledge. Some will complain that such rendering of the object of\nmoral knowledge is too subjective, since it turns moral knowledge into\na form of group self-knowledge. A similar worry was noted when we\ndiscussed group-based justification (Copp 1995) and pragmatic\nnaturalism (Kitcher 2011). We should concede that such worries need to\nbe answered.\n\n\nThe fourth, fifth, and sixth clusters concerning evolutionary,\nmethodological, and moral problems are easier to address, since the\nnew understanding of moral knowledge is based on (a) current knowledge\nof evolution, (b) the methodologies of (i) naturalized epistemology,\n(ii) reflective equilibrium when expanded to include moral consistency\nreasoning (Campbell 2014, 2017), and (iii) pragmatic naturalism, and\n(c) moral concerns raised by feminists. When moral knowledge is\ninterpreted to be consistent with psychological and evolutionary\nstudies of morality, these studies and the methodologies listed tend\nto reinforce the group-centered conception of moral knowledge. Issues\nwill remain, such as the ontological one just noted, but on balance\nthe problems for moral knowledge are diminished. The moral problems of\nbias raised in feminist epistemology are no exception, since the\nfeminist literature cited above emphasizes the social nature of moral\nknowledge. That said, resolution of the bias paradox in feminist\nepistemology may require a realist moral ontology (as noted in section\n6) and it may be unclear how to provide it. Our view that moral\nknowledge is possible is therefore qualified.\n11. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has addressed six major clusters of problems that threaten\nthe possibility of moral knowledge. Subject to the constraints noted\nat the outset, the aim has been to examine these problems with an eye\nto their complexity, especially their mutual ramifications, and to\nexplore avenues of possible resolution that are evident in the\nphilosophical and interdisciplinary literature. From this survey, we\ncan see that for each cluster of problems there are avenues of\nresolution worth further exploration, especially given\ninterdisciplinary research implying that moral knowledge is deeply\nsocial.",
