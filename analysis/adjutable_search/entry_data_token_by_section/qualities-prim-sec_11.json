Which difference coincides with\nthe distinction of P/SQs? Locke\u2019s report of what he calls\n\u201cquality\u201d in the subject, unlike the report of what he\ncalls \u201cidea in the mind\u201d, is often taken to be a\ndefinition (Curley 1972: 443; Rickless 2014: 84; Jacovides 2007a:\n110\u201311; Stuart 2013: 34\u20139). Accordingly, Curley (1972:\n443\u201345) argues roughly as follows. For Locke, all qualities are\npowers to cause ideas by definition, but SQs are such powers and only\nimputed to be qualities. So SQs are not consistently said to be\nqualities; but they are consistently said to be powers. He concludes\nthat there are, for Locke, two sorts of powers and the famous\ndistinction is based on RT. One problem is that RT is presented as a\nconsequence of the P/SQ distinction, not the source of it (R. Wilson\n2015: 200; Rickless 2014: 88).\n\nJacovides (2007a: 111\u201312; also Mackie 1976: 14\u20135) holds\nthat qualities are defined as powers and argues that this is\nconsistent with saying that SQs are powers and not qualities because\nLocke\u2019s notion of power is ambiguous as shown by this:\n\npower is an ability to do something which neither causes nor\nexplains its manifestations, e.g., the ability to digest does not\ndigest (E 2.21.20)\npower is \u201cthe source from which action proceeds\u201d, and\n\u201cwhen they [sc. powers of substances] are exerted into act, they\nare called \u2018causes\u2019\u201d (E 2.22.11).\n\n\nBut these texts contain only one notion of power: (a) argues that\npowers are not exerted by powers, but by substances\u2014the will\ndoesn\u2019t will; (b) identifies substances that exert their powers\nwith causes.\n\nWe can suggest a different solution. Locke\u2019s remarks about what\nhe calls \u201cidea\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d in E 2.8.8 are\nnot definitions by his lights; see E 3.3.15\u20137 on real and\nnominal essence. They are more like sufficient conditions for being\ndesignated by the terms \u201cidea\u201d or \u201cquality.\u201d\nBeing a power is sufficient for being designated by\n\u201cquality,\u201d as shown by color, etc., but it is not\nnecessary, as shown by the PQs of insensible particles which are not\npowers to cause ideas, but constituents of such powers. McCann (2011:\n59\u201367) argues that the PQs found in the microstructures of\nbodies are the causes of both ideas of SQs and ideas of the PQs of\nsensible bodies. He urges a divsion of types of PQs based on a\ndivision of labor\u2014insensible PQ are primary PQs whereas PQs of\ngross bodies are secondary PQs. For other solutions to the present\nissue, see Rickless (2014: 85), Stuart (2013: 34\u20139), R. Wilson\n(2015: 207\u20138).\n5.2.2 Epistemic basis of the criteria for PQs\n\nThe view that Locke argues for the distinction of P/SQs, at least in\npart, from the truth or adequacy of the CT (held by Alexander 1985:\n111\u201330; Mackie 1976: 17\u20138) is met with two objections:\nLocke\u2019s main interest in Essay Book 2 is in ideas\n(Atherton 1992) and Locke endorses neither the truth nor adequacy of\nCT (Ayers 2011: 136\u20137; Downing 1998; McCann 2011:\n179\u201385).\n\nRobert Wilson (2015) argues that there are four inseparability\ncriteria for primary qualities; two pertain only to sensible bodies\nand the others form a transdictive inference, i.e., an inductive\ninference from what is true of all sensible bodies to what is true of\ninsensible ones (on transdictive arguments, see R. Wilson 2002).\nStuart (2013: 46\u201352) objects that limiting two modes of\ninseparability to sensible bodies lacks textual support. Stuart\nmaintains that the criteria for PQs are the same as those for ideas\nincluded in the general abstract idea of body. But Jacovides (2007a:\n115) points out that Locke\u2019s account of this idea includes only\nextension, solidity, and capacity to communicate motion, not the full\nroster of Locke\u2019s PQs (see E 2.23.22).\n\nMichael Ayers (2011: 138\u201342) suggests Locke\u2019s distinction\nof qualities can be seen not as a consequence of the virtues of CT but\nas a source of its perspicuity. On this reading, the argument of\nEssay 2.8 is a pre-theoretical philosophical reflection on\nthe variety of affections bodies are observed to have and the\nintelligible mechanical interactions among observable solid rigid\nbodies.\n\nDowning (2007: 354\u201359) argues that the inseparability criteria\nare part of a corpuscularian argument for the distinction of qualities\nwhich accords with our natural understanding of physics. Locke does\nnot endorse the adequacy or truth of CT but, she contends, he regards\nit as an imperfect example of an ideal demonstrative physics which\nwould deduce all operations of bodies from their real essences, or\ninternal constitutions (see E 3.3.15; 4.6.11). She suggests\nEssay 2.8.8 through 14 makes an argument that relies on the\nimplicit ideal (see E 3.3.17). (See Ayers 1981, also Downing 1998)\n\nMcCann (2011) objects that Downing\u2019s account accords undue\nepistemic weight to the natural line of thought in Essay 2.8.\nHe maintains Locke\u2019s reasoning is non-theoretical and unable to\njustify assent. Its force is limited to showing how \u201cordinary\nfolks have to think\u201d about the qualities ordinarily ascribed to\nbodies (McCann 2011: 184\u20136). The discussion has weight enough to\novertop the common views about the resemblance of ideas of SQs to\ntheir causes, which is all Locke intends it to do (McCann 2011: 175,\n171\u20132).\n5.2.3 Metaphysical status of SQs and powers in general\n\nAccording to Curley (1972), Alexander (1974: 168\u2013171), and\nothers, SQs are textures. Alexander also maintains that colors, etc.\nare not SQs but ideas in minds. But the explicit account of SQs in\nEssay 2.8.10, repeated in E 2.8.23, 24; 2.21.73, stands\nagainst both of these interpretations. Passages that make an analogy\nbetween warmth, etc. and pain suggest secondary qualities are\nsubjective sensations (e.g., 2.8.17; also 2.8.21), but Robert Wilson\n(2015: 199) rightly objects that the sub-species, which includes the\nsun\u2019s power to melt wax and thereby give it the power to cause\nideas of liquidity, shows SQs to be powers to affect bodies as well as\nminds.\n\nGeorge Berkeley\u2019s Principles of Human Knowledge (1710)\n(hereafter \u201cPHK\u201d) and Three Dialogues between Hylas\nand Philonous (1713) (hereafter \u201cTD\u201d) have encouraged\nthis interpretation of Locke\u2019s doctrine of SQs. According to\nBerkeley, the philosophers\u2019 doctrine of P/SQs states that\nextension, size, motion, etc. inhere in mind-independent material\nsubstance and cause ideas that resemble them, whereas colors, tastes,\netc. are ideas that cannot resemble anything without a mind. In his\nview, philosophers are right about SQs and wrong about the status of\nPQs. He opposes the doctrine because it promotes a form of\nmaterialism. The distinction figures in his idealist, anti-materialist\nargumentation as a philosophically reputable means by which the\nadmitted mind dependence of SQs can be used to leverage that of PQs.\nOne tactic is to claim that arguments supposed to show that color,\netc. cannot exist without a mind can be used against PQs, too, where\nthe arguments in question are his own perceiver relativity\nconsiderations (TD [2008: 167\u201370]; PHK [2008: 88]). This is\npaired with the contention that we cannot abstract the idea of a PQ\nfrom all ideas of SQs, e.g., the sensory idea of a figure cannot be\nseparated from all other visual or tactual qualityies. Either both\nexist in the mind or neither does (PHK [2008: 70\u20131, 86]; TD\n[2008: 115\u20136]) Many subsequent philosophers wrongly assume that\nBerkeley\u2019s report of the philosophers\u2019 distinction applies\nto Locke\u2019s doctrine of qualities (see Stroud 1980; M. Wilson\n1982 [1999]])\n\nMost recent scholars hold that Essay 2.8.10 states what\ncolors. etc. are according to Locke: causal capacities with intrinsic\nor causal ground in the PQs of insensible particles. Mark Johnston\ndevelops this in terms of a sophisticated account of a dispositional\nproperty understood as a \u201cconstituted disposition\u201d:\n\u201ca higher order property of having the properties which,\noddities aside, would cause the manifestations of the disposition in\ncircumstances C.\u201d (Johnston 1992: 230\u201334) This comports\nwith the structure of a SQ according to Essay 2.9\u201310,\nbut the text says nothing about conditions or circumstances of\nmanifestation (see discussion of Essay 2.30.2 below in this\nsub-section).\n\nScholars also disagree about the metaphysical status of powers that\nderive from the micro-structures of observable bodies. Are they\nentities that exist in, say, an almond even though they depend on its\nbasic constituents and presuppose co-existence of a competent\nperceiver? Or is there nothing in the almond but the real qualities of\nit and its parts?\n\nJacovides (2007b) argues for the leaner alternative. He maintains that\nfor Locke, the explanatory entities are PQs, bodies, ideas, and minds.\nBecause they constitute the facts that determine the truth or falsity\nof our assertions about SQs, we have no need of ideas that track their\nderivatives (Jacovides 2007b: 630). As he sees it, the doctrine that\nSQs are powers is not about what is in the world but Locke\u2019s\nsolution to a semantic problem: a way we can speak that makes\nassertions about SQs true and certain and forestalls the mistaken\nsuggestions of the paronymous use of SQ terms (Jacovides 2007b:\n641).\n\nWithout objecting to this account of the semantics of names of SQs, we\ncan add that the doctrine of SQs solves an epistemic problem arising\nfrom Locke\u2019s thesis that the limited knowledge we have is\nsufficient for our needs (E 1.5). The solution to this problem is in\npart about the world. Jacovides overlooks Locke\u2019s semantic\ntheory of simple ideas of sensation in general and its function in his\nepistemology. The key texts are Essay 2.30.1\u20132,\n2.31.1\u20132. and 4.4.4. In outline, God sustains steady causal\nconnections among the different internal constitutions of bodies, the\nconstitutions of the bodies of perceivers, and all the simple ideas of\nsensation that enter their minds. With this foundation in place, the\nfact, as Locke has it, that we are aware that simple ideas of\nsensation come from without us enables these ideas to be, and be taken\nto be, reliable signs of things that are founded in reality (E 2.30.2,\n31.2; 4.4.4); for a defense of the natural sign interpretation of\nsimple ideas of sensation, see Ayers 1991: 60\u201364. Ideas of SQs,\nin particular, are not ideas of micro-constitutions; they do not\ninform us of the nature of what they represent. They are ideas of\npowers that stand in for the causal foundations that underwrite sense\nperception; see Ayers 1997 on the place-holder function of this idea\nof power. We cannot have perceptual knowledge of the nature of the\nfoundations. But because ideas of SQs track collections of PQ of\ninsensible particles on which the ideas depend, we have the cogntiive\nability to distinguish different objects we have to do with, discern\ntheir qualities, and take them for our needs (E 2.30.3; 4.4.4).\n5.2.4 Resemblance of ideas of PQs and qualities of bodies\n\nLocke\u2019s RT has spawned confusion on at least two points of\ndoctrine:\n\nHow resemblance between an idea of sensation and a quality\nexisting in actual things is to be understood;\nWhy RT is important, or what Locke intends to convey by asserting\nit.\n\nHow is \u201cresemblance\u201d to be understood?\n\nAyers (2011: 151\u201357) observes that Locke has more than one\naccount of what ideas are. According to a Cartesian view, ideas are\nintentional mental acts by which their objects are presented and\nrepresented to the mind (e.g., Essay 1.1.8; 4.1.2)). On this\nview, it is not difficult to understand what it is for an idea to\nresemble, or not to resemble, its object: it presents the object as\nhaving a feature that resembles (does not resemble) a feature the\nobject has. But Essay 2.8 introduces a different notion of\nideas: simple ideas of sensation are effects of the operations of\nbodies on our sensory organs. They are non-intentional sensations akin\nto raw pains. They acquire a representative function in virtue of\ntheir contingent causal connections to the constitutions of bodies\naround us. In Ayer\u2019s view, this makes the claim that ideas of\nPQs resemble qualities existing in bodies \u201cproblematic, if not\nabsurd\u201d (Ayers 2011: 154). Here it seems \u201cresembles\u201d\nmust mean \u201cshares a property with\u201d, not \u201cdepicts a\nthing as having a property it has\u201d. Problems with the former\ninclude that essentially mind-dependent ideas cannot be like anything\nthat can exist without a mind, as Berkeley says. Also, how can we know\nwhat the qualities of bodies are like in themselves given that we know\nthe qualities only by means of the ideas they cause in us? Also, it is\ndifficult to understand how an idea can share with a body the quality\nbeing 10 feet long, or moving away from the perceiver at 20 miles per\nhour, or being solid, and so on. Most scholars are resigned to saying\nor tacitly allowing that if simple ideas are taken to be\nnon-intentional qualia, the positive resemblance thesis is deeply\nproblematic.\n\nBut Jacovides (1999), undertakes to defend the literal interpretation\nof the positive RT. His defense is limited in two ways: it applies\nonly to visual ideas that are products of experience and metnions only\nrespects of resemblance that Locke and his contemporaries would have\nfound acceptable, such as the image of a tri image of a square and a\nsquare. Two broad problems can be mentioned:\n\nLocke appears to assert that all ideas of PQs\u2014tactual as\nwell as visual\u2014resemble qualities of their causes and\non this interpretation, the resemblance might be far from exact;\nbut the texts speak of \u201cperfect resemblances\u201d and mirror\nimages (E 2.8.16).\n\nWhy does Locke want to establish RT?\n\nMore central to Locke\u2019s distinction of P/SQs is the question why\nidea-quality resemblance and non-resemblance are important in\nLocke\u2019s view. RT is said to be a consequence of the argument\nthat establishes the P/SQ distinction in Essay\n2.8\u201314\u2014what does the further thesis do for Locke? In\nsections 16\u201319, the resemblance/non resemblance dichotomy and\nthe real/imputed quality dichotomies coincide (Rickless 2014:\n88\u201390). E. J. Lowe (2005: 51\u20132) suggests that in denying\nresemblance in the case of ideas of SQs, Locke \u201cexpresses the\nview that the ideas mislead us into taking a dispositional property to\nbe a real non-dispositional quality\u201d. But although we do\ncommonly make this mistake according to Locke, the fault is not with\nwhat ideas represent but our tendency to conflate ideas and\nqualities.\n\nMcCann (1994: 64), among others, suggests that Locke\u2019s purpose\nin denying that ideas of SQs resemble bodies is to discredit the\nscholastic theory that we perceive qualities of objects by receiving\nresemblances of them which are emitted by the objects. One objection\nis that Locke wholly repudiates this scholastic theory, so this fails\nto account for the positive part of RT.\n\nJacovides (2007a: 108\u2013110) suggests that epistemic concerns\nmotivate Locke\u2019s adherence to both parts of RT. As he sees it,\nLocke is worried that because ideas are the immediate objects of our\nknowledge, they may not represent external objects. So he thinks we\nshould have a presumption against assuming that ideas of sensation\nresemble things without us. The pain analogy provides a reason in\nsupport of this presumption. However, Jacovides maintains, Locke\nthinks it is overcome in the case of PQs because they play a part in\nCT which is our most intelligible account of how things happen in the\nworld. There is some truth to this general description, but it has no\nclear connection with Locke\u2019s interest in RT. The presumption is\nnot explicitly stated, as far as I know, and the epistemic worry about\nideas is stated only in Essay 4.4 where RT is not\nmentioned.\n\nThe arguments addressed to RT turn out to show that a quality is real\njust in case it resembles the idea of it. Essay 2.8, sections\n17 and 18 explicitly state that PQs are real qualities, i.e. qualities\nthat are in a body whether it is perceived or not, and SQs are not\nreal qualities; the point is reiterated in sections 22 and 23.\nRickless takes the emphasis on reality and non-reality to show that\nfor Locke, the most fundamental difference between PQs and SQs is that\nthe former are real qualities of bodies and the latter are not in the\nstrictest sense. We can suggest that although this may be the basic\ndifference from the perpective of natural philosophy, Locke\u2019s\ninterest in the P/SQ distinction derives from his more fundamentl\ninterest in the relation between perception and reality (see E 2.8.7,\n.22), From Locke\u2019s perpective, the basic difference is at the\nlevel of sorts of ideas of sensation and the difference has to do with\nhow they represent the real qualities present in bodies perceived by\nthe senses.\n",
