In addition to his academic work, his\npublic presence as a social and political commentator, particularly in\nFrance, led to a square in Paris being named in his honor on the\ncentenary of his birth in 2013. In the course of his long career he\nwrote on a broad range of issues. In addition to his many books,\nRicoeur published more than 500 essays, many of which appear in\ncollections in English. The Ricoeur Archive in Paris has made many of\nthose originally published in French available online through its\nwebsite.\n\nA major theme that runs through Ricoeur\u2019s writings is that of a\nphilosophical anthropology. Ricoeur came to formulate this as the idea\nof the \u201ccapable human being\u201d. With it he seeks to give an\naccount of the fundamental capabilities and vulnerabilities that human\nbeings display in the activities that make up their lives, and to show\nhow these capabilities enable responsible human action and life\ntogether. Though the accent is always on the possibility of\nunderstanding human beings as agents responsible for their actions,\nRicoeur consistently rejects any claim that the self is immediately\ntransparent to itself or fully master of itself. Self-knowledge only\ncomes through our understanding of our relation to the world and of\nour life with and among others in time in the world.\n\nIn the course of developing this anthropology, Ricoeur made several\nmajor methodological shifts, partly in response to changes in his\nintellectual setting as new developments came to speak to the topics\nhe was dealing with, sometimes in ways that challenged his own\napproach, partly as he pursued questions that had arisen as a result\nof his published work or that had not yet been considered there. His\nearly academic training was in the tradition of French reflexive\nphilosophy, a tradition that seeks to understand how the\n\u201cI\u201d comes to be aware of itself and of its thought and\naction starting from the lived experience of reflexive consciousness,\nour being aware of ourselves as existing, thinking, and acting. This\nfocus on reflexive consciousness always played a role in organizing\nRicoeur\u2019s thinking. His first major publications after World War\nII, though, were written using existential phenomenology and the\nFrench tradition of reflexive philosophy, reflecting not just his\nstudy of Husserl, which had begun prior to World War II but also of\nKarl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty. By 1960, however, Ricoeur had concluded that to study\nhuman reality properly, particularly given the existence of evil, he\nhad to combine phenomenological description and analysis with\nhermeneutic interpretation. This shift led to an increasing focus on a\ntheory of interpretation that could be grafted to phenomenology, an\napproach which he came to see was in fact called for by phenomenology.\nFor this hermeneutic phenomenology, whatever is intelligible comes to\nus in and through our use of language to talk about our lived\nexperience. While philosophical language and the categories it uses\nalways aim at being founded on univocal concepts, as actually used\nlanguage is always polysemic; it can have more than one meaning, more\nthan one translation, so all uses of language necessarily call for\ninterpretation. This hermeneutic or linguistic turn in Ricoeur\u2019s\nthought did not require him to disavow the basic results of his\nearlier investigations. It did, however, lead him not only to revisit\nthat work but also to see more clearly its broader implications,\nparticularly in relation to and in response to the development of\nstructuralism which he saw as a challenge to such a hermeneutic\napproach. In his later work, this led to an increasing emphasis on the\nfact that we live in time and in history. He took up this insight\nthrough the philosophy of discourse that he developed on the basis of\nthe increased emphasis on language in his philosophy. His late\nwritings also reflect a more direct concern for making sense of\nselfhood and personal identity as something that goes beyond the\nepistemological subject, and for ethics at the individual as well as\nthe societal and political levels, leading to his essays on the idea\nof the just and his last book on the possibility of mutual recognition\nand states of peace.\n", "toc": [{"#BiogSket": "1.

Biographical Sketch\n\nPaul Ricoeur was born on February 27, 1913 in Valence, France. His\nmother died shortly thereafter and his father was killed in the Battle\nof the Marne in 1915, so Ricoeur and his sister were reared by their\npaternal grandparents and an unmarried aunt in Rennes. They were\ndevout members of the French Reformed Protestant tradition. He was\nlater to speak of the role of faith in his life as \u201can accident\ntransformed into a destiny through an ongoing choice, while\nscrupulously respecting other choices.\u201d As a war orphan his\nschooling was paid for by the French government. He studied philosophy\nfirst at the University of Rennes and then at the Sorbonne. From the\nearliest years of his academic life he was convinced that there is a\nbasic, irreducible difference between things and human beings as\npersons and as agents. Unlike things, persons can engage in free,\nthoughtful action. But Ricoeur never accepted any version of a\nsubstance dualism in the person as the Cartesian cogito and\nthe Kantian transcendental subject can be read to require. He did,\nhowever, accept Kant\u2019s doctrine regarding the antinomies of\nreason and the necessary distinction between theoretical and practical\nreason. Ricoeur was studying in Germany when World War II broke out.\nSoon after being called up for service in the French army in 1939 he\nwas captured and spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Germany.\nThere he was able to study the work of Karl Jaspers and to prepare a\ntranslation of Husserl\u2019s Ideas I in the margins of the\nbook which he had to conceal from his jailers. After the war, he\ncompleted his doctorate and was appointed lecturer, then professor of\nthe history of philosophy at the University of Strasbourg, where he\nsucceeded Jean Hyppolite. He remained there until 1956, when he was\nnamed to the chair of general philosophy at the Sorbonne. In 1965, he\njoined the faculty of the new University of Paris at Nanterre, now\nParis X, whose establishment he had supported in light of the rapid\ngrowth in the number of university students at that time. He served a\ndifficult year as Dean of the faculty of letters following the student\nuprising of 1968. Except for three years he then spent at Louvain, he\ncontinued to teach a seminar at the Husserl Archive in Paris until he\nreached the mandatory retirement age in 1980. From 1954 on, Ricoeur\nalso lectured regularly in the United States and Canada. In 1970 he\nwas named to succeed Paul Tillich as the John Nuveen professor of\nphilosophical theology at the University of Chicago, with a joint\nappointment in the Divinity School, the Philosophy Department, and the\nCommittee on Social Thought. He taught there regularly for a portion\nof each year until 1992. In 1986 he gave the Gifford Lectures in\nEdinburgh, Scotland. Ricoeur\u2019s work has been translated into\nmore than twenty-five languages and he was honored by a volume in the\nLibrary of Living Philosophers series. Among his many\nhonorary doctorates are ones from Chicago (1967), Northwestern (1977),\nColumbia (1981), G\u00f6ttingen (1987), and McGill (1992). He was the\nrecipient of numerous awards, among them the Hegel Prize (Stuttgart,\n1985), the Dante Prize (Florence, 1988), the Karl Jaspers Prize\n(Heidelberg, 1989), the Leopold Lucas Prize (T\u00fcbingen, 1990), the\nFrench Academy Grand Prize for Philosophy (1991), the Kyoto Prize\n(2000), and the Pope Paul VI International Prize (2003). In 2004, he\nwas co-recipient of the John W. Kluge Prize in the Human Sciences\nawarded by the Kluge Center at the Library of Congress.\n2. Pre-hermeneutic Anthropology\n\nRicoeur\u2019s first major work was meant to appear in three volumes\nthat would lay out a philosophy of the will starting from an eidetic\nphenomenology of the voluntary and the involuntary. The second volume\nwould then turn to questions dealing with the empirical reality of the\nwill. The third volume would address the misuse of the will and the\nexistence of evil which cannot be explained through either a pure\nphenomenology of the will or its empirical existence. The projected\nthird volume was announced as intending to present what Ricoeur called\na poetics of the will and a vision of innocence in light of what\nRicoeur, following Karl Jaspers, called Transcendence. This latter\nvolume never appeared. It was delayed, then set aside when Ricoeur\ndiscovered new problems he had not foreseen and when he sought to\nrespond to new challenges to philosophy coming especially from\nstructuralism.\n\nThe first volume of this projected trilogy, Freedom and Nature:\nThe Voluntary and the Involuntary (1950), proposes a\nphenomenology of the will, while bracketing the reality of evil. It\ndraws on the method of phenomenology developed by Edmund Husserl. In\nit one finds an expression of a theme central to Ricoeur\u2019s\nanthropology, namely, the polar subjective/objective character of the\nconstituent features of lived human existence. Contrary to\nSartre\u2019s claim that there is radical difference between\nconsciousness (or the for-itself) and materiality (or the in-itself),\na difference that pits the freedom of the for-itself against the sheer\nfacticity of the in-itself, Ricoeur argues that the voluntary and\ninvoluntary dimensions of human existence are complementary. This can\nbe seen through a phenomenological description of the three structures\nthat constitute the voluntary pole of human existence: deciding,\nchoosing and moving to action, and our necessary consent to the\ninvoluntary as that which is acted upon through our will, whose organ\nis our body. There is no seamless harmony between these dimensions of\nwhat is finally a finite freedom. Human beings have to struggle with\nthe tension between them and ultimately to consent to their embodied\nlives and the world as something they do not fully create. It is the\nalways fragile resolution of this conflict that ultimately makes human\nfreedom genuinely human, and that gives us our distinctive identities\nboth as individuals and as members of larger historical communities\nand ultimately of humanity.\n\nRicoeur extends his account of freedom to take up the topic of evil in\nFallible Man and The Symbolism of Evil, both\npublished in 1960. In these works he addresses the question of how to\naccount for the fact that it is possible for us to misuse our freedom,\na question that had been bracketed in the initial phenomenological\nvolume. In Fallible Man he argues through a transcendental\nanalysis that this possibility is grounded in the basic disproportion\nthat characterizes human existence as located between the finite,\nperspectival nature of experience and the infinite, rational\ndimensions of taking up that experience in perception, practice, and\nfeeling, leading to the concept of fallibility. This disproportion\nshows up in every aspect of human existence, from perceiving to\nfeeling to thinking. It is evident in the human desire for\npossessions, power, and prestige. By reason of this disproportion, we\nare never wholly at one with ourselves and hence we can go wrong. We\nare fallible, yet evil, the misuse of our freedom, is neither original\nnor necessary, only always possible.\n\nNor does this disproportion render our existence meaningless. Rather,\nthe very disproportion that makes us fallible and makes human evil\ndoing possible is also what makes goodness, knowledge, and achievement\npossible. It is what distinguishes us from one another\u2014each one\nof us has his or her unique spatiotemporal location and perspective\nbut we can know ourselves as one human among many and we can seek to\nknow the world beyond our individual perspective on it. Our\nfallibility also makes it necessary and possible for us to communicate\nwith each other through our use of the logos which seeks to\ntranscend our localized points of view.\n\nThough the unity of humanity is never more than a unity founded on\ncommunication, precisely because we can communicate, the differences\namong us are never absolute. Furthermore, no one of us alone could be\na person. Though each of us has an individual identity, our identities\nshow that we are bound up with others: \u201cMan is this plural and\ncollective unity in which the unity of destination and the differences\nof destinies are to be understood through each other\u201d\n(Fallible Man, 138).\n\nThe kind of unity that binds people to one another even though they\ndiffer is found in their desire for esteem and recognition. This\ndesire seeks genuine mutuality that expresses esteem for the worth\nthat each of us has by reason of both our common humanity and our\nindividual uniqueness. This esteem positively values the disproportion\nconstitutive of every person. This theme of mutual recognition is\ndeveloped more fully in Ricoeur\u2019s final book The Course of\nRecognition, where he argues that it goes beyond mere reciprocal\nrecognition, like that found in commercial or other transactions\nreducible to an exchange of goods with no regard for who the other\nparty involved might be.\n\nThe study of history which acknowledges the temporality of our\nexistence confirms our desire for such mutual esteem. Such attention\nto history, in turn, further clarifies the finite nature of human\nfreedom. For Ricoeur, there is an order and structure to history\nconveyed through the narrating of history. Otherwise history would be\nunintelligible. But this narrated history also recounts events and\ndeeds that disrupt the prevailing order and reorder it, leading to the\nquestion whether forgiveness for the wrongs that have occurred and\ndebts that have been incurred might be possible, however difficult to\nachieve.\n\nThese reflections reinforced Ricoeur\u2019s conviction that what\nhumans say and do presupposes both a finite freedom that allows us to\nintervene in natural processes and a dependence on these same\nprocesses for the efficacy of such actions. What we say and do would\nbe meaningless if it did not fit into some antecedent structure or\npattern established by natural processes, on the one hand, and into\nwhat we say about such doings which intervene in those processes, on\nthe other. Our words and deeds are intended to express the meaning of\nwhat exists, if only because they give meaning to things as they now\nstand. In this sense, our words and deeds get their significance from\nbeing responses to contexts not wholly of our own making. What we say\nand do in such contexts can also aim beyond things as they now stand\nand sometimes does give expression to new meanings and values, as well\nas to unintended and as yet unrealized possibilities. In a word, our\nexercising of our finite freedom has worth and efficacy only by reason\nof our embodiment in a natural and cultural setting that is largely\nnot of our own making, but this is a world that we seek to appropriate\nthrough our words and deeds\u2014and our use of a productive\nimagination.\n\nRicoeur saw that this conception of the disproportion that\ncharacterizes human beings was insufficient to account for actual\noccurrence of a bad will and evil deeds. No direct, unmediated\ninspection of the cogito, like that he saw in Descartes and Husserl,\ncan show why these evils, contingent as each of them is, in fact came\nto be. Recognizing the opacity of the cogito in this respect confirmed\nhis belief that all self-understanding comes about only through\n\u201csigns deposited in memory and imagination by the great literary\ntraditions\u201d (Ricoeur, \u201cIntellectual Autobiography\u201d,\nin Hahn 1995: 16). This conclusion was a major motivator for his\nhermeneutic and, at the same time, \u201clinguistic turn\u201d.\n\nRicoeur next explored the problem of how then to account for the\nexistence of evil and its possible solution in The Symbolism of\nEvil. There, he argued that we should consider how people have\nsought to come to terms with their inability to make sense of the\nexistence of evil by using language that draws on the great symbols\nand myths that speak of its origin and end. This is language that\nconveys more than a single meaning, language that can always be\nunderstood in more than one way; hence it needs always to be\ninterpreted. This study concluded by saying that philosophy must learn\nto make sense of such language and learn to think starting from it,\nsomething Ricoeur summed up in a famous phrase: \u201cthe symbol\ngives rise to thought\u201d (The Symbolism of Evil, 1967:\n247\u201357). If philosophy is to take seriously this lesson taught\nby reflection on the symbolism of evil, it has to take up the problem\nof the \u201cfullness of language\u201d. This means considering\nthose uses of language that extend beyond a single word or sentence,\nas well as those which cannot be interpreted as simple logical\npropositions that say S is P. Like the primary symbols of\nevil\u2010stain, sin, and guilt\u2014these are forms of discourse\nthat can have more than one meaning. To make sense of the fullness of\nlanguage, therefore, philosophy has to develop a theory of\ninterpretation since actual discourse is not always, if ever univocal\nand its meanings do change over time when acts of discourse outlive\nthe speakers and situations in which they were originally\nproduced.\n\nIn working out this theory of interpretation in terms of a theory of\nlanguage as discourse, Ricoeur saw that what he now called the\nhermeneutic field to which interpretations applied was itself divided\ninternally between an approach such as that used in The Symbolism\nof Evil which sought to recover meaning that was assumed to be\nalready there and what he now called a hermeneutics of suspicion, like\nthat found in Marx, Nietzsche and Freud, which held that nothing\nultimately means what it first seems to say. The rise of structuralism\nin the 1960s and 70s, drawing on developments in linguistics,\ncontributed to this emphasis on suspicion by holding that it was an\nunderlying impersonal structure or structures that gave rise to the\napparent surface meaning. Structuralism also introduced the idea that\nthe identifying of such underlying structures could count as a\nreductive explanation of any surface-level meaning. Ricoeur\u2019s\nphilosophical project therefore turned to showing that while\nstructuralism could be incorporated as a method of inquiry\u2014look\nfor and learn from the proposed generative structures\u2014it went\nastray when it proposed itself as a theory of objectivity without\nsubjectivity, what Ricoeur called a transcendental philosophy without\na transcendental subject. Over time, he came to see that this limiting\nof structural analysis to a method of interpretation can be shown to\nfollow from the fact that structuralists always presupposed the\nsurface meaning they were trying to explain away. Moreover, because\nthey ignored time and discarded any notion of change, because the deep\nstructures they discovered were understood to be static and atemporal,\nthey could not really account for how structures generated surface\nmeanings, that is, how one structure could change into a different\nstructure.\n\nThis critique is found in the essays collected in The Conflict of\nInterpretations (1969) and in Ricoeur\u2019s detailed\nphilosophical reading of Freud, Freud and Philosophy (1970).\nFreud\u2019s own philosophy, according to Ricoeur, turns out to be an\narchaeology of the subject meant to provide at a theory of culture\n(civilization and its discontents), but it lacks the required\ncorresponding teleology of the subject that would allow for human\ncreativity and a capable human being. These investigations reinforced\nRicoeur\u2019s view that there is no unmediated self-understanding,\nleading to a turn to a more dialectical method in his work. This is an\napproach through which he seeks to find the middle term that can\nmediate between two polar terms and allow us to move back and forth\nbetween them. Locating such a mediating term leads to enhanced\nunderstanding. This understanding always comes about through\ninterpretation but is also itself open to critique. In other words,\nfor Ricoeur hermeneutics works with a method that mediates and\nnegotiates rather than removes the conflict of interpretations.\n\nBesides recognizing the fruitfulness of structural analyses of\nparticular well-defined fields of experience, Ricoeur resisted those\nstructuralists and post-structuralists who sought to reduce language\nitself to a closed system of signs having no reference to anything\noutside itself. Following clues found in the works of Emile Benveniste\nand Roman Jakobson, he defined discourse as the use of such sign\nsystems by someone to say something about something to someone, using\nexisting but malleable phonetic, lexical, syntactic, and stylistic\nrules. That is, discourse always involves a speaker or writer and a\nhearer or reader as well as something said in some situation about\nsome reality, ultimately a world that we might inhabit. It follows\nthat any interpretation of a form of discourse requires both the\nobjective sort of analysis for which structuralism provides a tool and\nan acknowledgment that there is always a surplus of meaning that goes\nbeyond what such objective techniques seek to explain. There is a\nsurplus of meaning because we apply objective techniques to things we\nalready understand as having a possible meaning without fully\nexhausting that meaning. The meaning of acts of discourse is moreover\nalways open to new interpretations, particularly as time passes and\nthe very context in which interpretation occurs itself changes.\n3. Interpretation and the Fullness of Language\n\nOn this basis Ricoeur\u2019s work after The Conflict of\nInterpretations addressed a number of related topics. On one\nlevel, he explored the practice of methods of interpretation as an arc\nleading from an initial situation and understanding to broadened\nunderstanding, both of the interpreter and the world as a world we can\nimagine ourselves as inhabiting. On a second level, he explored the\nbroader notion of the fullness of language through investigation of\ndifferent forms of extended discourse. These are uses of language that\nare longer than a single sentence and whose truth and meaning is not\nsimply reducible to the sum of the truth values of the individual\nsentences which make up such extended discourse. On the basis of these\ntwo interwoven levels, he could also take up the questions of selfhood\nand responsible human action, allowing him to spell out in greater\ndetail the ethical theory that had always been implicit in his\nphilosophy. His discussion of ethics starts from a focus on person to\nperson relations, the self and just one or only a few nearby others,\ncharacterized in the best case by solicitude for the other person and\nthe possibility of friendship, then subsequently moved on to the\nquestion of justice and living with others beyond those we may meet\nevery day or face to face. Here the question of rights and respect for\nthe faceless other arises. The specific question what is a just\nrelation in such situations (The Just, 2000; Reflections\non the Just, 2007), developed out of Ricoeur\u2019s\nparticipation in a seminar for judges, and led to his reflections in\nthe last work published during his lifetime on the idea of mutual\nrecognition (The Course of Recognition, 2005). In those final\nyears, he also continued to explore other dimensions of the fullness\nof language, for example, through some significant essays on the\nnotion of translation as occurring not just between languages but also\nwithin them (On Translation, 2006).\n\nRicoeur\u2019s investigation of practices of interpretation did not\npropose a single general theory applicable in each and every case. His\napproach was rather to formulate his theory of discourse as a use of\nlanguage meant to say something to someone about something using\nexamples of such discourse and their interpretation. But language as\nspoken is ephemeral, it disappears. Ricoeur\u2019s genial insight was\nto turn to examples that fixed such discourse by inscribing it in\ntexts or what might be treated as analogous to a text. The event of\nspeaking might disappear but the text remains for anyone who knows how\nto read. Hence it is the meaning of the text rather than the original\nauthor\u2019s intention or the originating situation that becomes the\nobject of interpretation. Structuralism was correct that texts have a\nstructure. But this structure varies depending on the kind of\ndiscourse inscribed in the text, so discerning that structure and how\nit contributes to shaping that discourse helps one identify the\ndiscourse as being of a certain type or genre. Initially recognizing\nthis genre is something like a guess that has to be confirmed through\ninterpreting the text, but a good reading also opens interpreters to\nbeing questioned about their initial assumptions by the text in\nquestion. What one discovers through such investigations, Ricoeur\nbelieved, is that there is something like a world of the text that\nlies not behind the text but metaphorically in front of it as\nsomething to be explored by the interpreter\u2019s imagination. This\nis a world that we can think of ourselves as inhabiting.\nInterpretations, of course, need to be checked against and challenged\nby other interpretations and they will sooner or later need to be\nredone as situations change over time. So there is a possibility of\nboth internal and external critique: is a text coherent in terms of\nits generic form, can it be confirmed or falsified by other similar\ndocuments or subsequent data? Explanatory techniques also play a role,\nparticularly when understanding breaks down. In a nice turn of phrase,\nRicoeur liked to say one then seeks to explain more in order to\nunderstand better. He also agreed with Hans-Georg Gadamer\u2019s\ntheory of hermeneutics that what is finally at stake in interpretation\nis a kind of appropriation, although Ricoeur saw this as more oriented\nto action in the present than to what Gadamer called the appropriation\nof tradition, although tradition always did have a role to play, even\nwhen criticized or rejected. He agreed with Gadamer, moreover, that\nthe goal of interpretation was to enable us to make sense of our\nembodied existence with others including our predecessors and\nsuccessors in the world.\n\nRicoeur did not produce a general theory of interpretation. His\nreflections on hermeneutics were themselves an instance of the\nphilosophical practice of interpretation leading to insight into what\nultimately underlies and enables such activity: the need to interpret\nin order to make sense of human life; the move from an initial\nunderstanding to greater understanding on the basis of critical\nreflection and an appeal to the imagination; interpolating explanatory\ntechniques and procedures where understanding breaks down;\nappropriation of the meaning of discourse in terms of the world it\nprojects, as a world one might inhabit. And finally: increased\nself-understanding.\n4. Forms of Extended Discourse\n\nRicoeur examined a number of different forms of extended discourse,\nbeginning with metaphorical discourse. Like the talk about symbols he\nhad explored earlier a live metaphor is a kind of discourse that says\nmore than one thing at the same time. Live metaphors are the product\nof sentences, not the result of substituting one word for another for\ndecorative or rhetorical effect. They presuppose a kind of odd\npredication, a \u201cmetaphorical twist\u201d. Unlike propositions\nwhich say something is or is not the case, a live metaphor says\n\u201cis\u201d and \u201cis not\u201d at the same time, leading\npossibly to a redescription of reality. As creative instances of the\nuse of language, live metaphors can die and be absorbed into the\ndictionary (a watch runs). Live metaphors can also extend beyond a\nsingle sentence as in the case of poetic discourse. Poetic discourse\nis thus a use of language that redescribes reality. Its truth is more\na matter of manifestation than of coherence or correspondence with\nwhat is assumed to be external reality. In an important sense, this\nexperienced truth is the basis for talk about coherence and\ncorrespondence, yet paradoxically metaphorical discourse always\npresupposes an already existing language that it can make use of. In\nthis sense, we are never at the origin of language. We can question\nback toward this origin but never reach it, since we always must begin\nby making use of existing language to question language. Philosophers\nof the fullness of language therefore always begin as having already\nbegun.\n\nNarrative discourse is another form of extended discourse investigated\nby Ricoeur. It is a use language that allows us to make practical\nsense of human action and time. Ordinary language already contains\nconcepts that apply to action\u2014those of intentions, motives,\ncauses, reasons, acts, consequences, agents and patients, for\nexample\u2014just as it contains concepts applicable to time: past,\npresent, future, now, then, when. Narrative discourse configures such\nheterogeneous concepts into a discourse that locates actions in a time\nwhere one thing happens not just after something else but because of\nsomething else in a followable story or history. It refigures physical\nevents as narrative events, events which make sense because they tell\nwhat happens in a story or history. But because narratives have\nendings or must end, they never fully exhaust time or the possible\nlong-term meaning of action. Through their plots they are always a\nsynthesis of heterogeneous concepts into a kind of discordant\nconcordance which configures the episodes of the story into a told\nstory. In so doing they resolve practically if not theoretically the\nconflict between time understood as a lived now\u2014this present\nwhich has a past and a future\u2014and cosmic time conceived of as a\nsequence of points, where any point can be a now point defined not in\nterms of its past and future but merely in terms of points that come\nbefore and after it. Narrative interweaves these two perspectives on\ntime into human time without ever fully resolving the aporias raised\nby thinking about time in time.\n\nReligious discourse, at least as found in the Hebrew and Christian\nbiblical tradition takes many forms: hymns, laws, narratives,\nparables, prophecy, wisdom sayings. What they have in common that\nspecifies them as religious discourse is that they are all forms of\npoetic discourse and they all in their own way \u201cname\u201d God.\nWithin their setting within the biblical canon they do so through\ntheir constituting a polyphony that enables the religious traditions\nthat use these texts both to identify and to legitimate themselves\nthrough a kind of hermeneutic circle. That is, such texts are sacred\nto traditions which take them as legitimating the tradition founded on\nthese texts, through their reading and interpreting of such texts.\n\nPolitical discourse is a particularly fragile form of extended\ndiscourse since the political dimension of human existence is one\nrealm among others like commerce or the arts and also the one that\ncontains all the others. It is an especially rhetorical form of\ndiscourse in the sense of being discourse that aims at persuasion.\nPersuasion is necessary because there is no final resolution of the\nconflicts that can arise over questions about the best form of\ngovernment or whether there should be, say, a law, what that law ought\nto be, or whether laws are required in this case at all. That politics\nalso is about power, the power to make decisions and command others\nadds to the fragility of such discourse in that politics is always\nbased on a revocable willingness to live together. This leads to a\ndialectic of ideology and utopia in Ricoeur\u2019s political\nphilosophy. Ideologies both claim to legitimate the positions of those\nin power or those seeking power and cover the gap between what they\nassert and the way things actually are. Utopian thinking, in return,\nimagines a world without or beyond ideology. It sometimes enables\npeople to overthrow particularly ruinous forms of ideology, only to\nfall back into a dependence on ideology since utopia exists\n\u201cnowhere\u201d. Yet politics is necessary because it makes\npossible life together. That it always takes place between these two\npoles of ideology and utopia is another example of a mediating term\nbetween opposed poles in Ricoeur\u2019s hermeneutics.\n5. Narrative Identity and the Turn to Selfhood\n\nAt the end of his three volume study of narrative (Time and\nNarrative, 1984\u201388) Ricoeur realized that what was said\nthere pointed to the importance of the idea of a narrative identity.\nThis has to do not just with the identity of the characters in a story\nor history, but with the larger claim that personal identity in every\ncase can be considered in terms of a narrative identity: what story\ndoes a person tell about his or her life, or what story do others tell\nabout it? In effect, narrative identity is one of the ways in which we\nanswer the question \u201cwho?\u201d Who is this? Who said that? Did\nthat? Who is that? Who are we? In his 1986 Gifford Lectures (published\nas Oneself as Another, 1992) Ricoeur expanded this\ninvestigation to the broader question of what it is to be a self. This\ndiscussion was meant to reply to interpretations of the Cartesian\ncogito which either made it too strong (one can immediately\nbe in touch with the self as certain of itself) or too weak (a merely\nabstract truth) or even said the self does not exist. Against this\nlatter idea of a \u201cshattered cogito\u201d Ricoeur proposed a\nhermeneutics of selfhood and a \u201cwounded cogito\u201d. This was\nthe idea and reality of a person capable of attesting to his or her\nown existence and acting in the world, a self that both acted and was\nacted upon who could recount and take responsibility for its actions.\nInsofar as we can speak metaphysically of such a self it has to be in\nterms of act and potentiality rather than substance.\n\nRicoeur\u2019s argument regarding selfhood proceeds through a\nsequence of stages. He begins from the philosophy of language and the\nquestion of an identifying reference to persons as selves, not simply\nthings. This leads to consideration of the speaking subject as an\nagent, passing through the semantics of action Ricoeur had learned\nfrom analytic philosophy during his time in North America. Next comes\nthe idea of the self as having a narrative identity which is then is\nfollowed by the question of the ethical aim of being such a self. This\nhermeneutics of selfhood culminates in the conclusion that one is a\nself as one self among other selves, something that can only be\nattested to through personal testimony or the testimony of others.\nSelfhood is thus closely tied to a kind of discourse that says\n\u201cI believe-in\u201d. Its certainty is a lived conviction rather\nthan a logical or scientific certainty.\n\nAlong the way Ricoeur to this conclusion introduces a key distinction\nbetween two kinds of identity in relation to selfhood. Idem\nidentity is the identity of something that is always the same which\nnever changes, ipse identity is sameness across and through\nchange. Self-identity involves both dimensions: I am and am not the\nperson I was ten years ago. It is the existence of ipse\nidentity that indicates that a self is better thought of in terms of\nthe question \u201cwho?\u201d than in terms of the question\n\u201cwhat\u201d is a self.\n\nSince the self is an agent the question of its ethical aim arises,\nallowing Ricoeur to introduce what he calls his \u201clittle\nethics\u201d. This introduces new predicates for the self and another\npath toward the self, one that shifts the argument from description\ntoward prescription. Ricoeur presents this little ethics through what\nhe calls its ethical intention: \u201caiming at a good life lived\nwith and for others in just institutions\u201d (Oneself as\nAnother, 1992: 172). This formula indicates that there is a\npriority of ethics (understood as teleological) over morality\n(understood as normative practice). In fact, the structure is\nthreefold: the ethical aim has to pass through the sieve of the norm,\nwhich is meant to realize the ethical intention, to be applied in\nspecific situations on the basis of phronesis or practical\nwisdom that will apply the norm appropriately. It is also possible to\nread the sequence backwards: for example, when a disaster, say a new\ndisease, leads to new normative practices growing out of the response\nto it, thereby throwing new light in turn on the ethical intention. At\nthe level of relations between a self and nearby or intimate others,\nthe ideal of reciprocity entailed here is best expressed as solicitude\nthat enables both self-esteem and self-respect on the parts of those\ninvolved. At the level of the distant other or others, the question of\njustice arises and with it new notions of respect and of institutions\nsuch as the rule of law that establish and help maintain or restore a\njust distance between those involved in them. Underlying both levels\nis the idea expressed by the golden rule that one ought not do to\nothers what one does not want done to him- or herself. And beyond\nevery institutionalized system of rules lies the transformative\npossibility of love which transcends the fragile and provisory\npractical meditations established by every ethical system through\napplying and, if necessary, reinterpreting the golden rule. Love is a\nway of responding not just to the limits of any such system but to the\ntragic dimension Ricoeur sees as inherent in all human action, which\nnever fully achieves what it intends, another reminder that human\nfreedom is always a finite freedom.\n6. Memory, History, Forgetting\n\nAll these threads in Ricoeur\u2019s philosophy come together in\nRicoeur\u2019s last big book (Memory, History, Forgetting,\n2004) pointing to the final revised lectures on recognition. This\nthree part work first takes up the question of memory and recollection\nin response to questions about uses and abuses of memory in\ncontemporary society. Ricoeur lists these as occurring on a\npathological-therapeutic level as the problem of blocked memory; on a\npractical level as manipulated memory, and on an ethical-political\nlevel as obligated memory. He then asks whether history is a remedy\nfor or a hindrance to these problems. This leads him back to the\nquestion of the epistemology of historical research and writing, a\ntopic he already had addressed in History and Truth (1965)\nand Time and Narrative. Now the question is to what extent\nhistory depends on memory. Historians know more about the past than\nindividuals remember, but can history completely break with an appeal\nto memory as a kind of testimony? I was there, believe me. The problem\nhere is suspicion not simply falsification. What is new to\nRicoeur\u2019s account is that he sees at work a closer tie between\nexplanation and understanding than he had considered in his earlier\nwork where explanation aids understanding. He now speaks of what he\ncalls explanatory understanding. It runs through what, following the\nFrench historian Michel de Certeau, he now calls the historiographical\noperation that characterizes the whole process of historical\ndocumentation, research, and writing. This shift in Ricoeur\u2019s\nthinking leads him to consider the question of historical\nrepresentation as an image based on both narration and rhetoric.\nHistory as written, he suggests, \u201cstands for\u201d the past as\n\u201chaving been\u201d.\n\nOn this basis, he can again ask about human existence as historical,\nas being within time and ultimately uncanny. He seeks particularly to\naddress the problem of forgetting in relation to the three problems\nlisted earlier. Traces of the past can be lost, and that past will be\nforgotten in the sense of being beyond memory. But what of forgetting\nwhere the traces remain? Here is where the problems of blocked,\nmanipulated, or commanded memory remain, especially in the latter case\nwith attempts to order forgetting either through amnesty or\ncensorship. This problem leads to an epilogue on the possibility of\nforgiveness, something Ricoeur admits is left incomplete. Along the\nway though, he shows that the idea of guilt, historical guilt\nnecessarily runs up against the limit of the imprescriptible and that\nforgiveness, which is difficult but not impossible, is something like\na gift, one that unbinds the agent from the act. Beyond the\ndistinction of a happy memory and an unhappy one in other words lies\nthe possibility of a forgetting held in reserve. To forgive is not to\nforget. It is this idea of forgiveness as a gift, but not one\nrequiring or expecting a gift in return but as something received and\npassed on as a second gift that leads the discussion of mutual\nrecognition and states of peace in Ricoeur\u2019s last book, The\nCourse of Recognition.\n\nRicoeur\u2019s argument there starts from the surprising fact that\nthere has been no recognized theory of recognition similar to what\nexists for theories of knowledge. In fact, when he looks in the\ndictionary he finds that the word (which in French carries as strong a\nsense of gratitude as of what English calls recognition), the word has\nnumerous lexical senses. Ricoeur therefore proposes to construct a\nchain of conceptual meanings that runs from recognition in the active\nvoice to its use in the passive voice, to being recognized. The demand\nfor recognition that runs through this sequence can only be answered,\nhe claims, by mutual recognition, \u201cwhere this mutual recognition\neither remains an unfulfilled dream or requires procedures and\ninstitutions that elevate recognition beyond the friendship of\nface-to-face relations to the political plane\u201d (The Course\nof Recognition, 19). This sequence of concepts of recognition\nruns from identifying something to identifying oneself to recognizing\nand being recognized by others. In the process the concept moves away\nfrom simply being identified with knowledge. Instead it opens the way\nto knowledge as it relates to self-knowledge and genuine community for\nwhich one is and can be grateful in that recognition \u201clightens\nthe weight of obligation to give in return and reorients this toward a\ngenerosity equal to the one that led to the first gift [of being\nrecognized]\u201d (243).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Books by Ricoeur", "Selected Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Books by Ricoeur": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Karl Jaspers et la philosophie de l\u2019existence</em>,\nwritten with Michel Dufrenne, Paris: Seuil, 1947.", "<em>Gabriel Marcel and Karl Jaspers: Philosophie du myst\u00e8re\net philosophie du paradoxe</em>, Paris: Temps Present, 1947.", "<em>Philosophie de la volont\u00e9 I.
