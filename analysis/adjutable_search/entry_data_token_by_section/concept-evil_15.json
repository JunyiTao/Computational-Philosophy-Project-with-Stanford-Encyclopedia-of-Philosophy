    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Evil Action || Evil and Responsibility\n3.6 Evil and Responsibility\n\nIt is universally accepted that to perform an evil action an agent\nmust be morally responsible for what she does. Although hurricanes and\nrattle snakes can cause great harm, they cannot perform evil actions\nbecause they are not moral agents. Furthermore, moral agents only\nperform evil actions when they are morally responsible for what they\ndo and their actions are morally inexcusable (see e.g., Kekes 2005;\nCard 2010; Formosa 2008 and 2013). To meet these conditions evildoers\nmust act voluntarily, intend or foresee their victim\u2019s\nsuffering, and lack moral justification for their actions. It is\nparticularly controversial whether these conditions are met in three\nsorts of cases: (1) serious harms brought about by psychopaths; (2)\nserious harms brought about by individuals who have had bad\nupbringings; and (3) serious harms brought about through\nignorance.\n3.6.1 Psychopaths\n\nPsychopathy is a syndrome that consists in lacking certain emotional,\ninterpersonal, and behavioural traits and having others (Hare 1999).\nSome of the defining characteristics of psychopathy include shallow\nemotions, egocentricity, deceitfulness, impulsivity, a lack of\nempathy, and a lack of guilt and remorse. Particularly relevant for\nassessments of moral responsibility is the psychopath\u2019s\ninability to care for others and for the rules of morality.\n\nAccording to the M\u2019Naughten rules for criminal insanity, a\nperson is legally insane if, due to a disease of the mind at the time\nof acting, she is unable to know the nature or quality of her action\nor to know that what she is doing is wrong. For instance, a delusional\nschizophrenic who believes that her neighbour is a demon is not\nresponsible for harming her neighbour since she does not understand\nthat she is harming an innocent person; she believes she is defending\nherself from an inhuman malicious agent. Many philosophers believe\nthat the M\u2019Naughten rules give us the conditions for moral\nresponsibility as well as the conditions for criminal responsibility\n(see, e.g., Wolf 1987).\n\nIt is controversial whether psychopaths are insane according to the\nstandard set by the M\u2019Naughten rules since it is controversial\nwhether psychopaths know that their actions are wrong. Motivational\ninternalists believe that it is conceptually impossible to believe\n(and thus to know) that an action is morally wrong and yet be\ncompletely unmotivated to refrain from performing the action.\nThat is, for the internalist, there is a conceptual connection between\nbelieving that an action is wrong and having a con-attitude toward the\naction. The internalist believes that one may be able to knowingly do\nwhat is wrong because, all things considered, she cares more about\nsomething that is incompatible with refraining from wrongdoing,\nprovided she is at least somewhat inclined to refrain from doing what\nshe knows to be wrong. Since psychopaths seem to be completely\nindifferent to whether their actions are right or wrong, motivational\ninternalists believe that they do not truly believe, or understand,\nthat what they do is morally wrong. At most, they might believe that\ntheir harmful actions break societal conventions. But it may be one\nthing to believe that one has broken a societal convention and quite\nanother to believe that one has broken a moral rule. Philosophers who\nreject the internalist thesis, i.e., motivational externalists, are\nmore willing to believe that psychopaths know the difference between\nright and wrong. According to motivational externalists, moral\nknowledge only requires an intellectual capacity to identify right and\nwrong, and not the ability to care about morality. Since psychopaths\nare not intellectually deficient, motivational externalists do not\nthink there is any reason to believe that psychopaths cannot tell the\ndifference between right and wrong. (For more about how the\ninternalist and externalist theses relate to the moral responsibility\nof psychopaths see Brink 1989, 45\u201350; Duff 1977; Haksar 1965;\nand Milo 1984. See also Rosati 2006. Recently, some theorists writing\nabout the moral responsibility of psychopaths have tried to avoid the\ninternalist/externalist debate. It is beyond the purview of this entry\nto survey this literature. See Levy 2007 and 2014, Matravers 2008,\nTalbert 2008, Aharoni, Kiehl, and Sinnott-Armstrong 2011, Nelkin\n2015.)\n3.6.2 Bad Upbringings\n\nThe degree to which deviant behavior is caused by bad upbringings\nrather than genetic starting points or individual choices is a\ndifficult empirical question. Assuming that there is a strong causal\nconnection between bad upbringings and deviant behaviour, there are\ntwo main arguments for the claim that we should not hold perpetrators\nmorally responsible for behaviour that has resulted from bad\nupbringings. The first argument contends that since we do not choose\nour upbringings we should not be held responsible for crimes which\nresult from our upbringings (See, e.g., Cole 2006, 122\u2013147).\nSusan Wolf (1987) offers a variant of this argument. According to Wolf\npeople who have had particularly bad upbringings are unable to make\naccurate normative judgements because they have been taught the wrong\nvalues. Wolf likens people who have been taught the wrong values to\npeople suffering from psychosis because like psychotics they are\nunable to make accurate judgements about the world. For example, Wolf\nhas us consider the case of Jojo, the son of Jo, a ruthless dictator\nof a small South American country. Jo believes that there is nothing\nwrong with torturing or executing innocent people. In fact, he enjoys\nexpressing his unlimited power by ordering his guards to do just that.\nJojo is given a special education which includes spending much of his\nday with his father. The predictable result of this education is that\nJojo acquires his father\u2019s values. Wolf argues that we should\nnot hold Jojo responsible for torturing innocent people since his\nupbringing has made him unable to judge that these actions are wrong.\nSince Jojo is unable to judge that his actions are wrong he meets the\nconditions for insanity as stated in the M\u2019Naghten rules (See\nsection 3.5.1 above).\n\nThe second argument for the claim that we should not hold people\nmorally responsible for crimes that result from bad upbringings begins\nwith the supposition that we are morally responsible for our crimes\nonly if we are appropriate objects of reactive attitudes, such as\nresentment (Strawson 1963). According to this argument, perpetrators\nof crimes who have had particularly bad upbringings are not\nappropriate objects of reactive attitudes since there is no point to\nexpressing these attitudes toward these perpetrators. A proponent of\nthis argument must then explain why there is no point to expressing\nreactive attitudes toward these perpetrators. In his paper\n\u201cResponsibility and the Limits of Evil: Variations on a\nStrawsonian Theme\u201d (1987) Gary Watson considers various ways to\nmake sense of the claim that there is no point to expressing reactive\nattitudes toward people who commit crimes due to bad upbringings.\nWatson\u2019s discussion centres on the case of Robert Alton Harris.\nAs a child, Harris was an affectionate good-hearted boy. Family\nmembers say that an abusive mother and harsh treatment at corrections\nfacilities turned him into a malicious cold-blooded murderer.\n3.6.3 Ignorance\n\nSometimes ignorance is used as an excuse for putative evildoing (Jones\n1999, 69\u201370). The argument goes something like this: if an agent\nhas no good reason to believe that she causes significant harm without\nmoral justification, then she is not morally responsible for causing\nthis harm because she has no good reason to act otherwise. For\ninstance, if Dorian shoots a gun into some bushes on a country estate\nwithout having any reason to believe that a man is hiding there, he is\nnot morally responsible for harming a man who is hiding there (this\ncase comes from Oscar Wilde\u2019s A Picture of Dorian\nGray). In this way ignorance can be a legitimate excuse for\ncausing unjustified harm.\n\nHowever, since Aristotle, theorists have recognized that ignorance is\nonly a legitimate excuse for causing unjustified harm when we are not\nresponsible for our ignorance, i.e., when the ignorance is\nnon-culpable (Nichomachean Ethics, Bk III). One sort\nof culpable ignorance which has received a fair bit of attention from\nphilosophers writing about evil is ignorance that results from\nself-deception. In self-deception we evade acknowledging to ourselves\nsome truth or what we would see as the truth if our beliefs were based\non an unbiased assessment of available evidence. \u201cSelf-deceivers\nare initially aware of moments when they shift their attention away\nfrom available evidence to something else, although they may not be\naware of the overall project of their self-deception.\u201d (Jones\n1999, 82). Some tactics used by self-deceivers to evade acknowledging\nsome truth, including (1) avoiding thinking about the truth, (2)\ndistracting themselves with rationalizations that are contrary to the\ntruth, (3) systematically failing to make inquiries that would lead to\nevidence of the truth and (4) ignoring available evidence of the truth\nor distracting their attention from this evidence (Jones 1999, 82).\nSeveral theorists writing about evil have suggested that\nself-deception plays a significant role in the production of evil\nactions and institutions (Calder 2003 and 2004; Jones 1999; \nMorton 2004, 57\u201358; Thomas 2012).\n4. Contemporary Theories of Evil Character/Personhood\n\nThe terms \u2018evil personhood\u2019 and \u2018evil\ncharacter\u2019 are used interchangeably in the literature. This\nentry will follow this convention.\n\nExtant theories of evil personhood can be cross-listed as regularity\nor dispositional accounts on the one hand, and as action-based,\naffect-based, or motivation-based accounts on the other (aggregative\naccounts are also possible, however, it isn\u2019t clear that any\ntheorist currently holds an aggregative account [See Russell 2014,\n139\u2013153]). For example, John Kekes holds an action-based\nregularity account (Kekes 1990, 48; 1998, 217; 2005, 2), while Todd\nCalder holds a motive-based dispositional account (Calder 2009,\n22\u201327).\n\nAccording to regularity accounts, evil persons have evil-making\nproperties habitually, or on a regular basis. According to\ndispositional accounts, evil persons need never have evil-making\nproperties. It is sufficient to have a disposition to have evil-making\nproperties.\n\nAction-based accounts contend that evil-making properties are certain\nsorts of actions\u2014evil actions. Affect-based accounts contend\nthat evil-making properties are certain sorts of feelings\u2014evil\nfeelings. Motivation-based accounts contend that evil-making\nproperties are certain sorts of motivations\u2014evil desires.\n\nSome theorists argue for more than one sort of evil-making property.\nFor example, Luke Russell argues that both evil actions and evil\nfeelings are evil making properties (Russell 2014, 292), while Daniel\nHaybron argues that evil feelings and evil motivations are evil-making\nproperties (Haybron 2002b, 269).\n4.1 Action-Based Accounts\n\nMost theorists writing about evil personhood hold action-based\naccounts (See, e.g., Barry 2013, 87; Kekes 2005, 2; Thomas 1993, 82;\nRussell 2014, 180). According to action-based accounts, evil persons\nperform evil actions often enough, or are disposed to perform evil\nactions. For example, Laurence Thomas argues that \u201ca person with\nan evil character is one who is often enough prone to do evil\nacts\u201d (Thomas 1993, 82).\n\nCritics argue that the problem with action-based accounts is that it\nseems sufficient for evil personhood to have evil feelings or\nmotivations, and thus, evil persons need not perform, or be disposed\nto perform, evil actions. For instance, it seems that a harmless\nsadist who relishes in the suffering of others but who is not disposed\nto perform evil actions, could still be an evil person. Similarly, a\ncowardly or incompetent sadist who strongly desires to cause others\nsuffering but who is not disposed to perform evil actions, is still an\nevil person (Calder 2009, 23; Haybron 2002b, 264).\n4.2 Affect-Based Accounts\n\nAccording to affect-based accounts, evil people have certain sorts of\nfeelings or emotions. For instance, Colin McGinn argues that \u201can\nevil character is one that derives pleasure from pain and pain from\npleasure\u201d (McGinn 1997, 62). There is some initial plausibility\nto this view since sadism and malicious envy are paradigms of evil.\nHowever, while it is undoubtedly true that some evil people are\nsadistic or maliciously envious, there is reason to believe that\nfeelings of pleasure in pain or pain in pleasure, or any other sorts\nof feelings, are neither necessary nor sufficient for evil character.\nThe problem with thinking that certain sorts of feelings are necessary\nfor evil character is that an evil person might routinely cause\nserious harm to her victims without any accompanying feelings. For\ninstance, someone who routinely runs down pedestrians out of\nindifference for their well-being, and without any accompanying\nfeelings, seems to qualify as an evil person (Calder 2003, 368).\n\nThe problem with thinking that certain sorts of feelings, such as\nfeelings of pleasure in another person\u2019s pain, are sufficient\nfor evil character is that these sorts of feelings might be\ninvoluntary and not endorsed by the person who has them. For instance,\nJohn might be just so constituted to experience pleasure in the face\nof another person\u2019s pain. If John does not desire to take\npleasure in other people\u2019s pain, and is horrified by his\nsadistic feelings, it seems too harsh to call him evil. He should be\npitied rather than condemned. Calling someone like John\n\u2018evil\u2019 would be like blaming someone for her patellar\nreflex (Calder 2003, 368\u2013369).\n4.3 Motivation-Based Accounts\n\nAccording to motivation-based accounts, to be an evil person is to be\nmotivated in a certain sort of way. For instance, Todd Calder argues\nthat to be an evil person it is sufficient to have a regular\npropensity for e-desires. An e-desire is a motivational state that\nconsists in a desire for what is correctly believed to be someone\nelse\u2019s significant harm for an unworthy goal or for what would\ncorrectly be believed to be someone else\u2019s significant harm for\nan unworthy goal in the absence of self-deception (see Section 3.5.3\nfor more on self-deceptive evil). According to Calder, significant\nharm is desired for an unworthy goal if a state of affairs\nconsisting of the achievement of the goal together with the harm would\nbe less valuable than if the goal was not achieved and the harm was\navoided (Calder 2003 and 2009. See also Card, 2002, 21 for a similar\nview).\n\nA problem for motivation-based accounts is to explain why we should\njudge someone as evil based solely on her motivations. In other words,\nwhy judge someone as the morally worst sort of person for having\ncertain desires if these desires do not result in significant harm?\nWhy not judge people as evil only if they actually cause significant\nharm? One way to respond to this objection is to point out that even\nif e-desires do not result in significant harm on some particular\noccasion or for some particular person, e-desires do, for most people\nmost of the time, lead to significant harm (Julia Driver\u2019s\nconsequentialist theory of virtue and vice (2001) uses a similar line\nof thought). Or else, a proponent of a motivation-based account could\ninsist that judgments of evil character look inward to an\nagent\u2019s psychology and not to the effects (or likely effects) of\nher actions (See Calder 2007b for a similar view about virtue and\nvice).\n\nHowever, if we insist that judgements of evil character look inward to\nan agent\u2019s psychology and not to the effects of her actions, why\njudge evil character solely on the basis of her motives? Why not take\ninto account the agent\u2019s affective states as well? (Haybron\n2002b, 267)\n4.4 Regularity Accounts\n\nAccording to regularity accounts, evil persons have evil-making\nproperties frequently, or on a regular basis (See, e.g., Card 2002,\n21; Kekes 1990, 48; 1998, 217; 2005, 3; Stone 2009, 23). For instance,\nJohn Kekes writes that when \u201cagents are regular sources of evil\n... we can identify them, and not merely their actions and character\ntraits, as evil\u201d (Kekes 1990, 48). An advantage of regularity\naccounts is that they explain the intuition that evil persons deserve\nour strongest moral condemnation (Russell 2014, 135). For if evil\npersons have evil-making properties frequently, or on a regular basis,\nthen it makes sense to say that they are the worst sorts of people and\ndeserve our strongest moral condemnation.\n\nHowever, one problem with regularity accounts is that they do not seem\nto be able to make sense of the fact that some evil persons only very\nrarely (if ever) have evil-making properties. For instance, Luke\nRussell argues that we should reject regularity accounts because they\ncannot accommodate the intuition that a brooding spree killer could be\nevil (Russell 2014, 139). The brooding spree killer does not perform\nevil actions frequently or regularly. She plans and fantasizes about\nher attack, and then performs evil actions sporadically or all at\nonce. Thus, Russell argues, if brooding spree killers can be evil, as\nwe think they can be, then we should reject regularity accounts.\n\nNotice, however, that Russell\u2019s counterexample only works\nagainst action-based regularity accounts, since proponents of affect\nor motivation based regularity accounts could argue that brooding\nspree killers do have evil-making properties, i.e. evil feelings or\nevil desires, habitually or regularly during the planning and/or\nfantasizing phase (even if they do not perform evil actions) and thus,\ncount as evil persons on these sorts of regularity accounts. So the\nquestion becomes, are there persons who are comparable to brooding\nspree killers in that they have evil feelings or desires sporadically\nor infrequently rather than on a regular basis? It seems that there\nmight be cases of this sort when opportunities for evil feelings and\ndesires are scarce. For example, we can imagine that an evil person\nmight fail to have evil feelings and desires because she has been\nstranded on a deserted island. After many years without potential\nvictims and needing to focus all of her attention on survival, she\nmight lack evil feelings and desires due to a poverty of stimulus.\nThis would mean that she is no longer an evil person on affect and\nmotivation based regularity accounts. However, it seems that we should\nsay that she is still an evil person if she is still disposed to have\nevil feelings and desires in the sense that her evil feelings and\ndesires would immediately return if she were presented with a victim.\nIf so, we should reject affect and motivation based regularity\naccounts.\n4.5 Dispositional Accounts\n\nMost theorists writing about evil personhood adopt dispositional\naccounts (See, e.g., Barry 2013, 87; Haybron 2002a, 70; Russell 2010\nand 2014, 154\u2013195). Broadly speaking, dispositional accounts\ncontend that someone is an evil person if, and only if, she is\ndisposed to have evil-making properties.\n\nA potential problem for dispositional accounts is that they seem to\nconflict with the intuition that evil persons are rare since most of\nus are disposed to have evil-making properties in certain sorts of\nsituations (Russell 2014, 159). For example, assuming for the moment\nthat evil actions are evil-making properties, Stanley Milgram has\nshown that most of us are disposed to perform evil actions\n(specifically, administering potentially lethal electric shocks to\ninnocent people) when in certain experimental conditions (i.e. when\nasked to do so by a researcher working for a prestigious institution\nin the context of a study on punishment and learning) (Milgram 1974).\nMilgram\u2019s experiments were designed to explain how thousands of\nordinary people could have played a role in bringing about the\nHolocaust during the Nazi era. Milgram\u2019s research suggests that\nmost of us are disposed to perform evil actions when influenced,\nmanipulated, or pressed to do so by authority figures, as many people\nwere in Nazi Germany (Russell 2014, 170\u2013173). But if most of us\nare disposed to perform evil actions in these situations then it seems\nthat on the dispositional account of evil personhood, most of us are\nevil, and thus, evil is not rare.\n\nTo make sense of the rarity of evil personhood, Luke Russell proposes\na restricted dispositional account according to which someone is an\nevil person if, and only if, she is strongly disposed to perform evil\nactions in only autonomy-favoring conditions (Russell 2014,\n72\u201375. Peter Barry argues for a similar view [See Barry 2013,\n82\u201390]).To be \u201cstrongly\u201d disposed (as opposed to\nmerely disposed) to have evil-making properties is to be very likely,\nas opposed to merely able, to have evil-making properties (Russell\n2014, 156). Autonomy-favoring conditions are conditions in which an\nevildoer is not \u201cdeceived, threatened, coerced, or\npressed\u201d (Russell 2014, 173), and thus, able to do what she\ntruly wants to do. According to Russell, although most of us are\nstrongly disposed to perform evil actions in Milgram scenarios, since\nMilgram scenarios are not autonomy-favoring conditions, most of us are\nnot evil persons.\n\nSeveral objections have been raised against Russell\u2019s\nautonomy-favoring dispositional account (Calder 2015b). One objection\nis that it isn\u2019t clear that Russell\u2019s restricted\ndispositional account is an improvement over a more basic\ndispositional account according to which evil persons are simply\nstrongly disposed to perform evil actions (Calder 2015b,\n356\u2013357). For it might be argued that since most of the subjects\nof Milgram\u2019s experiments were surprised and distressed by what\nthey were asked to do, they would not have taken part in further\niterations of the experiment. If so, the subjects of Milgram\u2019s\nexperiments were strongly disposed to perform evil actions only when\nsurprised by the novel circumstances of Milgram\u2019s experiment,\nand not on an on-going basis in those circumstances. But if we do not\nhave a disposition to perform evil actions on an on-going basis, then\nwe do not really have a strong disposition to perform evil actions, or\nat least, one could argue, not in the sense implicitly meant by the\nbasic dispositional account. Furthermore, if some subjects of\nMilgram\u2019s experiments would have willingly taken part in further\niterations of the experiment, it isn\u2019t clear that they\nwouldn\u2019t have been evil persons, which runs counter to\nRussell\u2019s autonomy-favoring dispositional account.\n\nA second objection to Russell\u2019s autonomy-favoring dispositional\naccount is that it is tailor-made to capture an intuition that some of\nus do not share: that most people could not be evil persons in any\nenvironment, even hostile political ones. Russell\u2019s theory is\nbased on the idea that if most of us would be strongly disposed to\nperform evil actions in certain sorts of environments, such as in Nazi\nGermany, then we aren\u2019t evil persons if we are disposed to\nperform evil actions in only those situations. But we might reject\nthis reasoning and argue instead that most of us are susceptible to\nbecoming evil persons in these environments, and so, need to be wary\nof these environments.\n4.6 Additional Theses about Evil Personhood\n\nIn addition to arguing for regularity or dispositional accounts on the\none hand, and action-based, affect-based, or motivation-based accounts\non the other, theorists have argued for several additional theses\nconcerning evil personhood.\n4.6.1 The Fixity Thesis\n\nAccording to the fixity thesis, evil persons have particularly fixed,\nor durable, characters such that it is very difficult to go from evil\nto non-evil, and changes of this sort rarely occur. Theorists add\nfixity components to their theories of evil personhood to capture the\nintuition that evil persons are near moral write-offs, beyond\n\u201ccommunication and negotiation, reform and redemption\u201d\n(Russell 2014 169. See also, Barry 2013, 82\u201387).\n\nTodd Calder has argued against the fixity thesis. Imagine that Darlene\nhas a highly fixed disposition to perform evil actions that she does\nlittle to resist. Geoff also has a disposition to perform evil\nactions, but this disposition is not highly fixed because he is\nindifferent about whether he should be disposed to perform evil\nactions and is, in general, capricious and unprincipled. It\nisn\u2019t clear that Darlene is an evil person while Geoff is not.\nIf so, the characters of evil persons need not be highly fixed (Calder\n2015b, 354).\n4.6.2 The Consistency Thesis\n\nAccording to the consistency thesis, evil persons have evil-making\nproperties, or are disposed to have evil-making properties,\nconsistently, or almost all of the time. For instance, Daniel Haybron\nargues that \u201cTo be evil is ... to be consistently vicious in the\nfollowing sense: one is not aligned with the good to a morally\nsignificant extent\u201d (Haybron 2002b, 269). By this he means that\nevil people almost always lack empathy and concern for others, and\nthey are in no way motivated to help others or to do what is morally\nright.\n\nSome theorists contrast the consistency thesis with the extremity\nthesis according to which evil persons have some set of character\ntraits to an extreme degree, e.g. extreme callousness or extreme\nmaliciousness (Haybron 2002a; Barry 2013, 56\u201371). The extremity\nthesis is consistent with most theories of evil personhood. The\nconsistency thesis is more controversial.\n\nCritics of the consistency thesis argue that it is too restrictive\n(Calder 2009, 22\u201327; Russell 2010, 241). Imagine that Bob loves\nto torture children and does so frequently, but that Bob also displays\ngenuine compassion for the elderly, perhaps by volunteering at a\nlong-term care facility on a regular basis. According to the\nconsistency thesis, Bob is not an evil person because he does not have\nevil-making characteristics consistently. And yet most people would\nwant to say that torturing children for fun on a regular basis is\nenough to make Bob an evil person (Calder 2009, 22\u201327).\n4.6.3 The Mirror Thesis\n\nAccording to the mirror thesis an evil person is the mirror-image of a\nmoral saint. Several theorists who write about evil personhood endorse\nthis thesis and use it to argue for their theories (Barry 2009; 2013;\nHaybron 2002b). For instance, Daniel Haybron argues that one reason to\naccept his contention that evil persons are wholly (or almost wholly)\nunaligned with the good is that it fits well with the intuition that\nmoral saints are \u201cperfectly, or near-perfectly, aligned with the\ngood\u201d (Haybron 2002b, 274. This argument makes an implicit\nappeal to the mirror thesis.\n\nLuke Russell rejects the mirror thesis, arguing that while moral\nsaints are morally admirable in all respects, some paradigmatic evil\npersons possess some morally admirable traits, such as courage,\ncommitment, and loyalty, which help them achieve their immoral goals\n(Russell 2010, 241\u2013242). Since evil persons need not be bad in\nevery respect and moral saints must be good in every respect, we\nshould reject the mirror thesis. In response, Peter Brian Barry argues\nthat on plausible conceptions of moral sainthood, i.e. those that can\nmake sense of actual moral saints such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin\nLuther King Jr., and Mother Teresa, moral saints can have some moral\nflaws (Barry 2011). Thus, the fact that some evil persons have some\nadmirable traits shouldn\u2019t convince us to reject the mirror\nthesis.\n5. Evil Institutions\n\nWhile most theorists writing about evil focus on evil action and evil\ncharacter, there has also been some discussion of evil institutions.\nWhen we speak of \u2018evil institutions\u2019 we might mean one of\ntwo things: (1) organizations that are evil or that perform evil\nactions, or (2) social practices that are evil, such as slavery and\ngenocide. Since an organization can only be evil, or perform evil\nactions, if it is morally responsible for what it does, the debate\nconcerning the concept of evil institutions in sense (1) is discussed\nunder the heading of \u2018collective responsibility.\u2019 Evil\ninstitutions in this sense will not be discussed in this entry. (For a\nrecent contribution to this literature which makes explicit reference\nto evil collectives, see Scarre 2012.)\n\nAccording to Claudia Card, an institution, in sense (2), i.e., a\nsocial practice, is evil if it is reasonably foreseeable that\nintolerable harm will result from its normal or correct operation\nwithout justification or moral excuse (2002, 20; 2010, 18,\n27\u201335). For instance, genocide is an evil institution since\nsignificant suffering and a loss of social vitality result from its\nnormal and correct operation without moral justification (Card 2010,\n237\u2013293).\n\nHowever, while Card\u2019s account of evil institutions correctly\nidentifies genocide and other paradigmatically evil institutions as\nevil, her account also classifies as evil some institutions which are\nless obviously evil such as capital punishment, marriage, and\nmotherhood (Card 2002, 2010). Her classification of marriage and\nmotherhood as evil has been particularly controversial.\n\nAccording to Card, marriage and motherhood are evil institutions\nbecause it is reasonably foreseeable that their normal, or correct,\noperation will lead to intolerable harm in the form of domestic abuse\nwithout justification or excuse (Card 2002, 139\u2013165). For\ninstance, Card argues that the normal, or correct, operation of\nmarriage leads to spousal abuse \u201cbecause it provides incentives\nfor partners to stay in broken relationships, places obstacles in the\nway of escaping from broken relationships, gives perpetrators of abuse\nvirtually unlimited rights of access to their victims, and makes some\nforms of abuse difficult or impossible to detect or prove\u201d\n(Calder 2009, 28). Card argues that there is no moral justification\nfor the intolerable harm that results from the institution of marriage\nsince nothing prevents us from abolishing marriage in favour of other\nless dangerous institutions.\n\nCritics argue that even if Card is correct that it is reasonably\nforeseeable that the institution of marriage will lead to intolerable\nharms, it is too heavy-handed to call marriage an evil institution.\nFor instance, Todd Calder has argued that an institution should be\nconsidered evil only if intolerable harm is an essential component of\nthe institution. Since suffering and a loss of social vitality are\nessential components of genocide, genocide is an evil institution. But\nsince spousal abuse is not an essential component of marriage,\nmarriage is not an evil institution (Calder 2009, 27\u201330).",
