    "main_text": "Probabilistic/Statistical Justifications of Simplicity\n5. Probabilistic/Statistical Justifications of Simplicity\n\nThe two approaches discussed in Sections 3 and 4\u2014a\npriori rationalism and naturalized empiricism\u2014are both in\nsome sense extreme. Simplicity principles are taken either to have no\nempirical grounding, or to have solely empirical grounding. Perhaps as\na result, both these approaches yield vague answers to certain key\nquestions about simplicity. In particular, neither seems equipped to\nanswer how exactly simplicity ought to be balanced against empirical\nadequacy. Simple but wildly inaccurate theories are not hard to come\nup with. Nor are accurate theories which are highly complex. But how\nmuch accuracy should be sacrificed for a gain in simplicity? The\nblack-and-white boundaries of the rationalism/empiricism divide may\nnot provide appropriate tools for analyzing this question. In\nresponse, philosophers have recently turned to the mathematical\nframework of probability theory and statistics, hoping in the process\nto combine sensitivity to actual practice with the\n\u2018trans-empirical\u2019 strength of mathematics.\n\nPhilosophically influential early work in this direction was done by\nJeffreys and by Popper, both of whom tried to analyze simplicity in\nprobabilistic terms. Jeffreys argued that \u201cthe simpler laws have\nthe greater prior probability,\u201d and went on to provide an\noperational measure of simplicity, according to which the prior\nprobability of a law is \\(2^{-k}\\), where\n\\(k =\\) order + degree + absolute values of the coefficients,\nwhen the law is expressed as a differential equation (Jeffreys 1961,\np. 47). A generalization of Jeffreys\u2019 approach is to look not at\nspecific equations, but at families of equations. For\nexample, one might compare the family, LIN, of linear equations (of\nthe form \\(y = a + bx)\\) with the family, PAR,\nof parabolic equations (of the form \\(y = a + bx + cx^2)\\). Since PAR is of higher degree\nthan LIN, Jeffreys\u2019 proposal assigns higher probability to LIN. Laws\nof this form are intuitively simpler (in the sense of being more\nelegant).\n\nPopper (1959) points out that Jeffreys\u2019 proposal, as it stands,\ncontradicts the axioms of probability. Every member of LIN is also a\nmember of PAR, where the coefficient, \\(c\\), is set to 0. Hence\n\u2018Law, \\(L\\), is a member of LIN\u2019 entails \u2018Law,\n\\(L\\), is a member of PAR.\u2019 Jeffreys\u2019 approach assigns\nhigher probability to the former than the latter. But it follows from\nthe axioms of probability that when \\(A\\) entails \\(B\\), the\nprobability of \\(B\\) is greater than or equal to the probability\nof \\(A\\). Popper argues, in contrast to Jeffreys, that LIN has\nlower prior probability than PAR. Hence LIN is\u2014in\nPopper\u2019s sense\u2014more falsifiable, and hence should be preferred\nas the default hypothesis. One response to Popper\u2019s objection is to\namend Jeffrey\u2019s proposal and restrict members of PAR to equations\nwhere \\(c \\ne 0\\).\n\nMore recent work on the issue of simplicity has borrowed tools from\nstatistics as well as from probability theory. It should be noted that\nthe literature on this topic tends to use the terms\n\u2018simplicity\u2019 and \u2018parsimony\u2019 more-or-less\ninterchangeably (see Sober 2003). But, whichever term is preferred,\nthere is general agreement among those working in this area that\nsimplicity is to be cashed out in terms of the number of free (or\n\u2018adjustable\u2019) parameters of competing hypotheses. Thus the\nfocus here is totally at the level of theory. Philosophers who have\nmade important contributions to this approach include Forster and\nSober (1994) and Lange (1995).\n\nThe standard case in the statistical literature on parsimony concerns\n curve-fitting.[15]\n We imagine a situation in which we have a set of discrete data points\nand are looking for the curve (i.e. function) which has generated\nthem. The issue of what family of curves the answer belongs in (e.g.\nin LIN or in PAR) is often referred to as model-selection.\nThe basic idea is that there are two competing criteria for model\nselection\u2014parsimony and goodness of fit. The possibility of\nmeasurement error and \u2018noise\u2019 in the data means that the\ncorrect curve may not go through every data point. Indeed, if goodness\nof fit were the only criterion then there would be a danger of\n\u2018overfitting\u2019 the model to accidental discrepancies\nunrepresentative of the broader regularity. Parsimony acts as a\ncounterbalance to such overfitting, since a curve passing through\nevery data point is likely to be very convoluted and hence have many\nadjusted parameters.\n\nIf proponents of the statistical approach are in general agreement\nthat simplicity should be cashed out in terms of number of parameters,\nthere is less unanimity over what the goal of simplicity principles\nought to be. This is partly because the goal is often not made\nexplicit. (An analogous issue arises in the case of Occam\u2019s Razor.\n\u2018Entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity.\u2019 But\nnecessity for what, exactly?) Forster distinguishes two\npotential goals of model selection, namely probable truth and\npredictive accuracy, and claims that these are importantly distinct\n(Forster 2001, p. 95). Forster argues that predictive accuracy tends\nto be what scientists care about most. They care less about the\nprobability of an hypothesis being exactly right than they do about it\nhaving a high degree of accuracy.\n\nOne reason for investigating statistical approaches to simplicity is a\ndissatisfaction with the vagaries of the a priori and\nnaturalistic approaches. Statisticians have come up with a variety of\nnumerically specific proposals for the trade-off between simplicity\nand goodness of fit. However, these alternative proposals disagree\nabout the \u2018cost\u2019 associated with more complex hypotheses.\nTwo leading contenders in the recent literature on model selection are\nthe Akaike Information Criterion [AIC] and the Bayesian Information\nCriterion [BIC]. AIC directs theorists to choose the model with the\nhighest value of \\(\\{\\log L(\\Theta_k )/n\\} - k/n,\\) where \\(\\Theta_k\\)\nis the best-fitting member of the class of curves of polynomial degree\n\\(k\\), \\(\\log L\\) is log-likelihood, and \\(n\\) is the sample size. By\ncontrast, BIC maximizes the value of \\(\\{\\log L(\\Theta_k )/n\\} -\nk\\log[n]/2n.\\) In effect, BIC gives an extra positive weighting to\nsimplicity by a factor of \\(\\log[n]/2\\) (where \\(n\\) is the size of\nthe sample).[16]\n\nExtreme answers to the trade-off problem seem to be obviously\ninadequate. Always picking the model with the best fit to the data,\nregardless of its complexity, faces the prospect (mentioned earlier)\nof \u2018overfitting\u2019 error and noise in the data. Always\npicking the simplest model, regardless of its fit to the data, cuts\nthe model free from any link to observation or experiment. Forster\nassociates the \u2018Always Complex\u2019 and the \u2018Always\nSimple\u2019 rule with empiricism and rationalism\n respectively (ibid.).\n All the candidate rules that are seriously discussed by statisticians\nfall in between these two extremes. Yet they differ in their answers\nover how much weight to give simplicity in its trade-off against\ngoodness of fit. In addition to AIC and BIC, other rules include\nNeyman-Pearson hypothesis testing, and the minimum description length\n(MDL) criterion.\n\nThere are at least three possible responses to the varying answers to\nthe trade-off problem provided by different criteria. One response,\nfavored by Forster and by Sober, is to argue that there is no genuine\nconflict here because the different criteria have different aims. Thus\nAIC and BIC might both be optimal criteria, if AIC is aiming to\nmaximize predictive accuracy whereas BIC is aiming to maximize\nprobable truth. Another difference that may influence the choice of\ncriterion is whether the goal of the model is to extrapolate beyond\ngiven data or interpolate between known data points. A second\nresponse, typically favored by statisticians, is to argue that the\nconflict is genuine but that it has the potential to be resolved by\nanalyzing (using both mathematical and empirical methods) which\ncriterion performs best over the widest class of possible situations.\nA third, more pessimistic, response is to argue that the conflict is\ngenuine but is unresolvable. Kuhn (1977) takes this line, claiming\nthat how much weight individual scientists give a particular\ntheoretical virtue, such as simplicity, is solely a matter of taste,\nand is not open to rational resolution. McAllister (2007) draws\nontological morals from a similar conclusion, arguing that sets of\ndata typically exhibit multiple patterns, and that different patterns\nmay be highlighted by different quantitative techniques.\n\nAside from this issue of conflicting criteria, there are other\nproblems with the statistical approach to simplicity. One problem,\nwhich afflicts any approach emphasizing the elegance aspect of\nsimplicity, is language relativity. Crudely put, hypotheses which are\nsyntactically very complex in one language may be syntactically very\nsimple in another. The traditional philosophical illustration of this\nproblem is Goodman\u2019s \u2018grue\u2019 challenge to induction. Are\nstatistical approaches to the measurement of simplicity similarly\nlanguage relative, and\u2014if so\u2014what justifies choosing one\nlanguage over another? It turns out that the statistical approach has\nthe resources to at least partially deflect the charge of language\nrelativity. Borrowing techniques from information theory, it can be\nshown that certain syntactic measures of simplicity are asymptotically\nindependent of choice of measurement\n language.[17]\n\nA second problem for the statistical approach is whether it can\naccount not only for our preference for small numbers over large\nnumbers (when it comes to picking values for coefficients or exponents\nin model equations), but also our preference for whole numbers and\nsimple fractions over other values. In Gregor Mendel\u2019s original\nexperiments on the hybridization of garden peas, he crossed pea\nvarieties with different specific traits, such as tall versus short or\ngreen seeds versus yellow seeds, and then self-pollinated the hybrids\nfor one or more\n generations.[18]\n In each case one trait was present in all the first-generation\nhybrids, but both traits were present in subsequent generations.\nAcross his experiments with seven different such traits, the ratio of\ndominant trait to recessive trait averaged 2.98\u00a0:\u00a01. On this\nbasis, Mendel hypothesized that the true ratio is 3\u00a0:\u00a01.\nThis \u2018rounding\u2019 was made prior to the formulation of any\nexplanatory model, hence it cannot have been driven by any\ntheory-specific consideration. This raises two related questions.\nFirst, in what sense is the 3\u00a0:\u00a01 ratio hypothesis\nsimpler than the 2.98\u00a0:\u00a01 ratio hypothesis? Second,\ncan this choice be justified within the framework of the statistical\napproach to simplicity? The more general worry lying behind these\nquestions is whether the statistical approach, in defining simplicity\nin terms of number of adjustable parameters, is replacing the broad\nissue of simplicity with a more narrowly\u2014and perhaps\narbitrarily\u2014defined set of issues.\n\nA third problem with the statistical approach concerns whether it can\nshed any light on the specific issue of ontological parsimony. At\nfirst glance, one might think that the postulation of extra entities\ncan be attacked on probabilistic grounds. For example, quantum\nmechanics together with the postulation \u2018There exist\nunicorns\u2019 is less probable than quantum mechanics alone, since\nthe former logically entails the latter. However, as Sober has pointed\nout, it is important here to distinguish between agnostic\nOccam\u2019s Razor and atheistic Occam\u2019s Razor. Atheistic OR\ndirects theorists to claim that unicorns do not exist, in the\nabsence of any compelling evidence in their favor. And there is no\nrelation of logical entailment between \\(\\{QM +\\) there exist\nunicorns\\(\\}\\) and \\(\\{QM +\\) there do not exist unicorns\\(\\}\\). This also\nlinks back to the terminological issue. Models involving circular\norbits are more parsimonious\u2014in the statisticians\u2019 sense of\n\u2018parsimonious\u2019\u2014than models involving elliptical\norbits, but the latter models do not postulate the existence of any\nmore things in the world.\n",
