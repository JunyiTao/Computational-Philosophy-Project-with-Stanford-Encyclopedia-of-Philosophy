    "main_text": "Patrilineage and Gender Oppression\n5. Patrilineage and Gender Oppression\n\nVirtuous and talented women who are able to leave their marks in the\nwai are indeed few and far between. Women for the most part\nin Confucian philosophy are exalted for their unyielding devotion and\ndiligent servitude to patrilineage throughout their life cycle as\ndaughters, wives, or mothers. Since there is no other socially\nsanctioned venue for women to leave their marks in history, the only\nsocial accolade for women comes in the form of their exceptional\ndevotion and servitude to patrilineage. The literary genre of\nbiographies of \u201cexemplary women\u201d (lien\u00fc\n\u5217\u5973) compiled by Confucian court historians is a case in\npoint.\n\nLiu Xiang\u2019s Lien\u00fc zhuan \u5217\u5973\u50b3\n(c. 18 BCE) is the inaugurating text for the\n\u201clien\u00fc\u201d literary tradition that later became\na standard feature in each dynastic history from the Han to the last\ndynasty of the Qing (for the \u201clien\u00fc\u201d entry\nin dynastic histories, see Judge and Ying 2011, Appendix B). Liu\nXiang\u2019s Lienu zhuan is a collection of commentarial\nbiographies of women from early antiquity onward and was originally\ncomposed as an admonition to Emperor Cheng (r. 33\u20137 BCE) to\nrecognize the importance as well as the precarious influences of\npalace women. The text was organized under six distinct sets of\nvirtues\u2014\u201cmaternal rectitude\u201d (muyi\n\u6bcd\u5100), \u201cworthy and enlightened\u201d\n(xianming \u8ce2\u660e), \u201cbenevolent and\nwise\u201d (renzhi \u4ec1\u667a), \u201cprincipled and\nrighteous\u201d (jieyi \u7bc0\u7fa9) and\n\u201cpersuasive and communicative\u201d (biantong\n\u8faf\u901a), plus one chapter on the \u201cdeprived and\nfavored\u201d (niebi \u5b7d\u5b16). As shown above,\nwomen in antiquity were not strictly praised for their gender roles\nper se since among the six sets of virtues enumerated in the text,\nonly the virtue of muyi \u6bcd\u5100 (maternal rectitude)\nis gender-role specific. And yet women\u2019s unyielding devotion and\ndiligent servitude to patrilineage still formed part of their social\nmemorialization in other non-gender specific categories of virtue.\n",
