    "main_text": "The Conventionality Thesis\n1. The Conventionality Thesis\n\n\nThe debate about the conventionality of simultaneity is usually\ncarried on within the framework of the special theory of relativity.\nEven prior to the advent of that theory, however, questions had been\nraised (see, e.g., Poincar\u00e9 1898) as to whether simultaneity\nwas absolute; i.e., whether there was a unique event at location A\nthat was simultaneous with a given event at location B. In his first\npaper on relativity, Einstein (1905) asserted that it was necessary to\nmake an assumption in order to be able to compare the times of\noccurrence of events at spatially separated locations (Einstein 1905,\n38\u201340 of the Dover translation or 125\u2013127 of the Princeton\ntranslation; but note Scribner 1963, for correction of an error in the\nDover translation). His assumption, which defined what is usually\ncalled standard synchrony, can be described in terms of the following\nidealized thought experiment, where the spatial locations A\nand B are fixed locations in some particular, but arbitrary,\ninertial (i.e., unaccelerated) frame of reference: Let a light ray,\ntraveling in vacuum, leave A at time t1\n(as measured by a clock at rest there), and arrive at B\ncoincident with the event E at B. Let the ray be\ninstantaneously reflected back to A, arriving at time\nt2.  Then standard synchrony is defined by saying\nthat E is simultaneous with the event at A that\noccurred at time (t1 +\nt2)/2. This definition is equivalent to the\nrequirement that the one-way speeds of the ray be the same on the two\nsegments of its round-trip journey between A and\nB.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note (as pointed out by Jammer (2006, 49), in his\ncomprehensive survey of virtually all aspects of simultaneity) that\nsomething closely analogous to Einstein\u2019s definition of standard\nsimultaneity was used more than 1500 years earlier by St. Augustine in\nhis Confessions (written in 397 CE). He was arguing against\nastrology by telling a story of two women, one rich and one poor, who\ngave birth simultaneously but whose children had quite different lives\nin spite of having identical horoscopes. His method of determining\nthat the births, at different locations, were simultaneous was to have\na messenger leave each birth site at the moment of birth and travel to\nthe other, presumably with equal speeds. Since the messengers met at\nthe midpoint, the births must have been simultaneous. Jammer comments\nthat this \u201cmay well be regarded as probably the earliest\nrecorded example of an operational definition of distant\nsimultaneity.\u201d\n\n\nThe thesis that the choice of standard synchrony is a convention,\nrather than one necessitated by facts about the physical universe\n(within the framework of the special theory of relativity), has been\nargued particularly by Reichenbach (see, for example, Reichenbach\n1958, 123\u2013135) and Gr\u00fcnbaum (see, for example,\nGr\u00fcnbaum 1973, 342\u2013368). They argue that the only\nnonconventional basis for claiming that two distinct events are not\nsimultaneous would be the possibility of a causal influence connecting\nthe events. In the pre-Einsteinian view of the universe, there was no\nreason to rule out the possibility of arbitrarily fast causal\ninfluences, which would then be able to single out a unique event\nat A that would be simultaneous with E. In an\nEinsteinian universe, however, no causal influence can travel faster\nthan the speed of light in vacuum, so from the point of view of\nReichenbach and Gr\u00fcnbaum, any event at A whose time of\noccurrence is in the open interval between t1 and\nt2 could be defined to be simultaneous\nwith E. In terms of the \u03b5-notation introduced by\nReichenbach, any event at A occurring at a\ntime t1 + \u03b5(t2 \u2212\nt1), where 0 < \u03b5 < 1, could be\nsimultaneous with E. That is, the conventionality thesis\nasserts that any particular choice of \u03b5 within its stated\nrange is a matter of convention, including the choice \u03b5=1/2\n(which corresponds to standard synchrony). If \u03b5 differs from\n1/2, the one-way speeds of a light ray would differ (in an\n\u03b5-dependent fashion) on the two segments of its round-trip\njourney between A and B. If, more generally, we\nconsider light traveling on an arbitrary closed path in\nthree-dimensional space, then (as shown by Minguzzi 2002,\n155\u2013156) the freedom of choice in the one-way speeds of light\namounts to the choice of an arbitrary scalar field (although two\nscalar fields that differ only by an additive constant would give the\nsame assignment of one-way speeds).\n\nIt might be argued that the definition of\nstandard synchrony makes use only of the relation of equality (of the\none-way speeds of light in different directions), so that simplicity\ndictates its choice rather than a choice that requires the\nspecification of a particular value for a parameter. Gr\u00fcnbaum\n(1973, 356) rejects this argument on the grounds that, since the\nequality of the one-way speeds of light is a convention, this choice\ndoes not simplify the postulational basis of the theory but only gives\na symbolically simpler representation.\n",
