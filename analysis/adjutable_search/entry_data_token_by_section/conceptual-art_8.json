    "main_text": "Five Philosophical Themes || The Aesthetic Value of Art\n3.3 The Aesthetic Value of Art\n\nUnderlying the claim that we need to have a direct experiential\nencounter with an artwork in order to appreciate it appropriately is\nthe fact that some of the properties that bear on the value of a work\ncan only be grasped in this way. The properties in question here are\ngenerally aesthetic properties, and the assumption motivating\nthe experiential requirement is that the appreciation of artworks\nnecessarily involves an aesthetic element (i.e. not necessarily beauty\nper se, but something aesthetically pleasing or\nrewarding).\n\nHowever, one of the most distinguishing features of conceptual art,\nsetting out as it does to replace illustrative representation with\nsemantic representation, is that it does not prioritise aesthetic\nexperience in a traditional sense. Conceptual art is intended as an\nart of the mind: it generally appeals to matters of the intellect and\nemphasises art\u2019s cognitive rather than\naesthetic value. In the words of Timothy Binkley, traditional\naesthetics is preoccupied \u2018with perceptual entities\u2019 and\nthis \u2018leads aesthetics to extol and examine the \u201cwork of\nart\u201d, while averting its attention almost entirely from the\nmyriad other aspects of that complex cultural activity we call\n\u201cart\u201d \u2019 (Binkley 1977, 271).\n\nWe can now see that the experiential requirement may well fail to have\nany bite with regards to conceptual artworks because the\nartist\u2019s aim does not necessarily involve conferring to the work\nof art properties that must be experienced directly in order to be\ngrasped and fully appreciated. If there is to be any kind of\nfirst-hand experiential requirement for the appropriate appreciation\nof conceptual artworks, it will perhaps be of a kind that focuses on\nan imaginative engagement with the idea central to the artwork rather\nthan a perceptual experience of its aesthetic properties (see\nSchellekens 2007)\n\nThe main philosophical question highlighted by conceptual art in this\ncontext, then, is the following: \u2018Does art really need to be\naesthetic, and, if so, in what sense?\u2019. In Binkley\u2019s\nopinion, and in support of conceptual art, one does not necessarily\nhave to think of art in terms of aesthetic value \u2013whilst a lot\nof \u2018art has chosen to articulate in the medium of an aesthetic\nspace\u2019, there is \u2018no a priori reason why art must confine\nitself to the creation of aesthetic objects. It might opt for\narticulation in a semantic space instead of an aesthetic one so that\nartistic meaning is not embodied in a physical object or event\u2019\n(Binkley 1977, 273).\n\nHowever, not everyone has endorsed such a liberal view about the\nseparation between the aesthetic and the\n artistic[7].\n If art does not aim at having aesthetic value, what, one might argue,\nwill set it apart from non-art? Which view one decides to favour on\nthis point may well end up being an issue about definition. If one\nwishes to define art in terms of aesthetic experience, the question\nfinds a clear-cut answer, namely that conceptual art simply cannot be\nconsidered a kind of art. The down-side of that position is, however,\na whole set of difficult concerns to do with things, such as nature or\npersons, that hardly qualify as art even though they invite aesthetic\nexperiences. If one is impressed by these worries and cannot see any\ndecisive philosophical reason to uphold the aesthetic view, there is\nlittle, if anything, to block a conception of art which is not\nnecessarily aesthetic. One may, then, think of aesthetic value as\none kind of artistic value that, alongside with moral,\nreligious, political, historical and financial value, some artworks\nhave and others do\n not.[8]\n\nNow, even if it is granted that art need not be aesthetic, it is still\npossible to hold that conceptual art does not qualify as good\nart because it does not (aim to) yield aesthetic experiences. But\nwhile this may be a viable position to hold in relation to the project\nof conceptual art in general, it cannot be used to attack conceptual\nart on its own grounds. Saying, for example, of Michael\nCraig-Martin\u2019s An Oak Tree that one cannot consider it\na great work of art because it fails to give rise to a distinctively\naesthetic kind of pleasure does not actually undermine the project.\nConceptual art, as we now know, is more about conveying meaning\nthrough a vehicular medium than about furnishing its audiences with\nexperiences of, say, beauty. Any attack on this fundamental feature of\nconceptual art targets not so much an individual work of art but\nrather finds fault with the artistic tradition itself.\n",
