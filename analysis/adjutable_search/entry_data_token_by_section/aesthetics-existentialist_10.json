    "main_text": "The existentialist \u201csystem of the arts\u201d || Theatre\n10.1 Theatre\n\n\nFor most of the existentialists, theatre is the prime art form,\ni.e., the one that best allows the artist to use his or her freedom to\ncreate a virtual world that simultaneously appeals to the\naudience\u2019s own freedom (regardless of how we define that freedom,\ntheologically or politically). For Camus, de Beauvoir, Marcel and\nSartre, philosophical activity and recognition as playwrights were\nintimately linked (Goldthorpe 1986). Marcel defined himself as\n\u201cphilosophe-dramaturge\u201d (philosopher-dramatist,\nsee Lazaron 1978), to insist on what was, for him, an indissoluble\nunity between philosophical meditation and playwriting. Indeed, it is\nwell worth noting that, apart from de Beauvoir (whose single attempt at\nwriting for the theatre was not very successful [see de Beauvoir 1945b\nand 1962, 672\u2013673]), they were all equally famous as playwrights and as\nphilosophers in their time.\n\n\nArguably, Sartre\u2019s theoretical reflections on the theatre of\nhis time have remained the most widely read today. In describing\nwhat were for him the defining features of existentialist theatre,\nSartre also aimed to identify some of the main aspects of theatre\nitself. As these features are grounded in his theory of freedom,\ntheatre is, for Sartre, the art par excellence.\n\n\nThe identification of art in general with the theatre is already\nevident in the fact that the same word \u2013 \u2018situation\u2019\n\u2013 simultaneously encapsulates the metaphysical position of the human\nbeing-in-the-world, and summarises theatre\u2019s core aesthetic\nelement (Sartre 1976, 35). The two \u2018enemies\u2019 in French\nexistentialism, Sartre and Marcel, agree on the centrality of the\nconcept of \u2018situation.\u2019 What is literature? had\ndefined the mission of literature as the attempt \u201cto reveal the\nworld and particularly to reveal man to other men so that the latter\nmay assume full responsibility before the object which has been thus\nlaid bare\u201d (Sartre 1948a, 14). Centred as it is on the praxis of\nreal human beings confronted with the contradictions of concrete\nsituations, theatre is the best medium to present in purified form the\ntragic responsibility of human freedom, the fact that \u201cwe are\ncondemned to be free\u201d in a world inhospitable to our\nprojects.\n\n\nThis emphasis on action and situation leads to a series of highly\nprescriptive rules, as we see in the criteria that Sartre used in\nhis critical reviews of contemporary theatre writing and production. To rise\nto the task of achieving a \u201ctheatre of situations,\u201d writing\nand production must resist the temptation of focusing on the\ncharacters; they need to present archetypical situations in\nwhich human freedom is most radically at stake, notably through\ndifferent types of universal \u2018conflicts of rights.\u2019 Theatre\nneeds to avoid psychology and concentrate on action (in clear contrast\nto Marcel\u2019s theatre, which is mainly concerned with staging\nconflicts of inner conscience); it must be wary of a realistic approach\nthat might take the focus away from the violence of the conflicts. For\nthe same reason, the duration of the play and the number of the\ncharacters must be reduced. The stage must be empty and the language\nmust be direct but non-realistic, compressing the acuteness of the\nsituation as powerfully as possible. In short, existentialist theatre\nexplicitly intends to return to a Greek conception, attempting to\npresent contemporary \u201cmyths\u201d in a world without gods\n(Sartre 1976).\n\n\nBut the situations, precisely, are situated: they always take place\nin specific social and political contexts. The myths that the theatre\npresents, therefore, have two temporal dimensions: 1) Because they are\nabout distinguishing features of human \u2018being,\u2019 they have,\nlike Greek and Corneillian tragedy, a transhistorical appeal; they are\nplays about human freedom in general. This explains the classical bent\nof many existentialist plays. Thus, it makes perfect sense to stage the\nconundrums of modern, absurd freedom through the figure of Caligula, as\nCamus does in one of his most famous plays. 2) The situation is always\na specific one, particularly a specific social and political\ncircumstance, with its specific conflict of rights. In the years\nfollowing the Second World War, the conflict of rights is widely\nunderstood as the conflict between liberal rights and the socialist\nideal. All the existentialists agreed on this, with the notable\nexception of Marcel. The \u2018communist question\u2019 (of whether\nto embrace the proposed communist solution to the problems facing the\nworld in 1948\u2014the date of publication of What is\nLiterature?) was one of the most urgent political questions for\nthem. More generally, we can mention the question of the value of\nindividual engagement as opposed to engagement in a collective movement\n(a question at the centre of Malraux\u2019s novels, notably his\nHuman Condition, which approaches the existentialist\naesthetic), and the place of individual freedom in an age of conflict\nbetween global forces. These questions were at the forefront of\nexistentialist concerns when they devised their aesthetics, and wrote\ntheir plays and novels.\n\n\nWe have noted the similarity between Sartre and Marcel regarding\ntheir emphasis on the notion of situation. Although Sartre noted other\nfeatures of existentialist theatre that formally apply to\nMarcel\u2019s plays, there are stark differences in their approach to\nplaywriting. Whereas for Sartre the ultimate justification of theatre\nis political, for Marcel it is metaphysical: it is a question of\nfinding salvation and hope, and safeguarding the possibility of faith.\nYet, like Sartre\u2019s, Marcel\u2019s plays staged the specific\nproblems of the age as he saw them, e.g., how the rise of technology\nbrings about a reductive attitude to the world and especially to other\nhuman beings, the atrocities of the century, and the moral\ndisorientation of modern individuals. Despite his metaphysical\noptimism, Marcel\u2019s theatre shares with other existentialist plays\na patently sombre mood. He wants to depict \u201cthe drama of the soul\nin exile, of the soul that suffers from its lack of communion with\nitself and with others\u201d (Preface to Troisfontaines 1953,\n35). Marcel\u2019s plays consistently portray a creeping feeling of\nabsurdity that befalls the main characters. It is a forgotten fact that\nMarcel wrote more plays than any of the other existentialists.\n",
