    "main_text": "Political Philosophy\n5. Political Philosophy\n\nFrom the first issue of Les Temps Modernes in October 1945\nuntil his death, Merleau-Ponty wrote regularly on politics, including\nreflections on contemporary events as well as explorations of their\nphilosophical underpinnings and the broader political significance of\nhis times. During his eight-year tenure as unofficial managing editor\nof Les Temps Modernes, he charted the review\u2019s\npolitical direction and penned many of its political\n editorials.[7]\n After leaving Les Temps Modernes in 1953, Merleau-Ponty\nfound new outlets for his political writings, including\nL\u2019Express, a weekly newspaper devoted to the\nnon-communist left. Both of the essay collections that he published\nduring his lifetime, Sense and Non-Sense and Signs,\ndevote significant space to his political writings. He also published\ntwo volumes devoted entirely to political philosophy, Humanism and\nTerror (HT) and Adventures of the Dialectic (1955 AdD).\nAlways writing from the left, Merleau-Ponty\u2019s position gradually\nshifted from a qualified Marxism, maintaining a critical distance from\nliberal democracy as well as from Soviet communism, to the rejection\nof revolutionary politics in favor of a \u201cnew liberalism\u201d.\nHis political writings have received relatively scant attention\ncompared with other aspects of his philosophy, perhaps because of\ntheir close engagement with the political situations and events of his\nday. Nevertheless, scholars of his political thought emphasize its\ncontinuity with his theoretical writings and ongoing relevance for\npolitical philosophy (see Coole 2007; Whiteside 1998; Smyth 2014;\nMelan\u00e7on 2021).\n\nThe 1947 publication of Humanism and Terror responded to\ngrowing anti-communist sentiment in France fueled in part by the\nfictional account of the Moscow trials in Arthur Koestler\u2019s\npopular novel Darkness at Noon. Merleau-Ponty sought to\narticulate an alternative to the choice Europe apparently faced in the\nsolidifying opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union.\nHumanism and Terror criticizes Koestler\u2019s portrayal of\nthe fictional Rubochov, modeled on Nikolai Bukharin, for replacing the\n\u201cmutual praxis\u201d of genuine Marxism (HT: 102/18)\nwith an opposition between pure freedom and determined history, the\n\u201cyogi\u201d who withdraws into spiritual ideals or the\n\u201ccommissar\u201d who acts by any means necessary. Turning to an\nexamination of Bukharin\u2019s 1938 trial, Merleau-Ponty finds there\nan example of \u201crevolutionary justice\u201d that \u201cjudges\nin the name of the Truth that the Revolution is about to make\ntrue\u201d (HT: 114/28), even though the historical contingency that\nthis entails is denied by the procedures of the trials themselves. On\nthe other hand, Trotsky\u2019s condemnation of Stalinism as\ncounter-revolutionary similarly misses the ambiguity of genuine\nhistory. Ultimately, the dimension of terror that history harbors is a\nconsequence of our unavoidable responsibility in the face of its\nessential contingency and ambiguity.\n\nAlthough violence is a consequence of the human condition and\ntherefore the starting point for politics, Merleau-Ponty finds hope in\nthe theory of the proletariat for a fundamental transformation in the\nterms of human recognition:\n\n\nThe proletariat is universal de facto, or manifestly in its\nvery condition of life\u2026. [I]t is the sole authentic\nintersubjectivity because it alone lives simultaneously the separation\nand union of individuals. (HT: 221/116\u201317)\n\n\nA genuinely historical Marxism must recognize that nothing guarantees\nprogress toward a classless society, but also that this end cannot be\nbrought about by non-proletarian means, which is what Soviet communism\nhad apparently forgotten. Despite the failures of the Soviet\nexperiment, Merleau-Ponty remains committed to a humanist Marxism:\n\n\nMarxism is not just any hypothesis that might be replaced tomorrow by\nsome other. It is the simple statement of those conditions without\nwhich there would be neither any humanism, in the sense of a mutual\nrelation between men, nor any rationality in history. In this sense\nMarxism is not a philosophy of history; it is the philosophy\nof history and to renounce it is to dig the grave of Reason in\nhistory. (HT: 266/153)\n\n\nEven if the proletariat is not presently leading world history, its\ntime may yet come. Merleau-Ponty therefore concludes with a\n\u201cwait-and-see\u201d Marxism that cautions against\ndecontextualized criticisms of Soviet communism as well as apologetics\nfor liberal democracies that whitewash their racist and colonial\nviolence.\n\nRevelations about the Gulag camps and the outbreak of the Korean War\nforced Merleau-Ponty to revise his position on Marxism and\nrevolutionary politics, culminating in the 1955 Adventures of the\nDialectic (AdD). The book begins with the formulation of a\ngeneral theory of history in conversation with Max Weber. Historians\nnecessarily approach the past through their own perspectives, but,\nsince they are themselves a part of history\u2019s movement, this\nneed not compromise their objectivity. The historical events and\nperiods within which the historian traces a particular style or\nmeaning emerge in conjunction with historical agents, political actors\nor classes, who exercise a creative action parallel to the expressive\ngesture of the artist or the writer. History may eliminate false\npaths, but it guarantees no particular direction, leaving to\nhistorical agents the responsibility for the continuation or\ntransformation of what is inherited from the past through a genius for\ninventing what the times demand: \u201cIn politics, truth is perhaps\nonly this art of inventing what will later appear to have been\nrequired by the time\u201d (AdD: 42/29). Merleau-Ponty finds a\nsimilar position articulated by the young Georg Lukacs, for whom\n\u201cThere is only one knowledge, which is the knowledge of our\nworld in a state of becoming, and this becoming embraces knowledge\nitself\u201d (AdD: 46/32). History forms a third order, beyond\nsubjects and objects, of interhuman relations inscribed in cultural\nobjects and institutions, and with its own logic of sedimentation and\nspontaneity. The self-consciousness that emerges within this third\norder is precisely the proletariat, whose consciousness is not that of\nan \u201cI think\u201d but rather the praxis of their common\nsituation and system of action. Historical truth emerges from the\nmovement of creative expression whereby the Party brings the life of\nthe proletariat to explicit awareness, which requires, in return, that\nthe working class recognize and understand itself in the Party\u2019s\nformulations.\n\nWith this understanding, Lukacs aims to preserve the dialectic of\nhistory, to prevent it from slipping into a simple materialism, and\nthereby to discover the absolute in the relative. But Lukacs\nbacktracks on this position after its official rejection by the\ncommunist establishment in favor of a metaphysical materialism, and\nMerleau-Ponty finds a parallel in Marx\u2019s own turn away from\ngenuine dialectic toward a simple naturalism that justifies any action\nin the name of a historical necessity inscribed in things. For the\nlack of a genuine concept of institution that can recognize dialectic\nin embodied form, Marxist materialism repeatedly abandons its\ndialectical aspirations, as Merleau-Ponty further illustrates through\nthe example of Trostky\u2019s career.\n\nIn the final chapter of Adventures, Merleau-Ponty turns his\nsights toward Sartre\u2019s endorsement of communism in The\nCommunists and Peace. On Merleau-Ponty\u2019s interpretation,\nSartre\u2019s ontological commitment to a dualism of being and\nnothingness, where the full positivity of determinate things\njuxtaposes with the negating freedom of consciousness, eliminates any\nmiddle ground for history or praxis. Since consciousness is\nunconstrained by any sedimentation or by the autonomous life of\ncultural acquisitions, it can recognize no inertia or spontaneity at\nthe level of institutions, and therefore no genuine historical\nbecoming. More centrally, by interpreting the relation between the\nParty and the proletariat through his own conception of consciousness\nas pure freedom, Sartre rules out in principle any possibility for\ntheir divergence. This leads Sartre to an\n\u201cultrabolshevism\u201d according to which the Party\u2019s\nposition is identified with the revolutionary agenda, any opposition\nto which must be suppressed.\n\nIn the Epilogue that summarizes Merleau-Ponty\u2019s own position, he\nexplains his rejection of revolutionary action, understood as\nproletarian praxis, for remaining equivocal rather than truly\ndialectical. The illusion that has brought dialectic to a halt is\nprecisely the investment of history\u2019s total meaning in the\nproletariat, ultimately equating the proletariat with dialectic as\nsuch, which leads to the conviction that revolution would liquidate\nhistory itself. But it is essential to the very structure of\nrevolutions that, when successful, they betray their own revolutionary\ncharacter by sedimenting into institutions. Drawing on the extended\nexample of the French revolution, Merleau-Ponty argues that every\nrevolution mistakes the structure of history for its contents,\nbelieving that eliminating the latter will absolutely transform the\nformer. Thus, \u201cThe very nature of revolution is to believe\nitself absolute and to not be absolute precisely because it believes\nitself to be so\u201d (AdD: 298/222). While Soviet communism may\ncontinue to justify itself in absolute terms, it is concretely a\nprogressivism that tacitly recognizes the relativity of revolution and\nthe gradual nature of progress. The alternative that Merleau-Ponty\nendorses is the development of a \u201cnoncommunist left\u201d, an\n\u201ca-communism\u201d, or a \u201cnew liberalism\u201d, the\nfirst commitment of which would be to reject the description of the\nrivalry between the two powers as one between \u201cfree\nenterprise\u201d and Marxism (AdD: 302\u20133/225). This\nnoncommunist left would occupy a \u201cdouble position\u201d,\n\u201cposing social problems in terms of [class] struggle\u201d\nwhile also \u201crefusing the dictatorship of the proletariat\u201d\n(AdD: 304/226). This pursuit must welcome the resources of\nparliamentary debate, in clear recognition of their limitations, since\nParliament is \u201cthe only known institution that guarantees a\nminimum of opposition and of truth\u201d (AdD: 304/226). By\nexercising \u201cmethodical doubt\u201d toward the established\npowers and denying that they exhaust political and economic options,\nthe possibility opens for a genuine dialectic that advances social\njustice while respecting political freedom.\n",
