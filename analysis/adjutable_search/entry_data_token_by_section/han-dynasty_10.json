    "main_text": "Eastern Han (25\u2013220CE) || Philosophy of Language: Xu Gan on Name and Actuality\n4. The Transition to Three Kingdoms and Wei-Jin\n\nToward the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty and into the fractious\n\u201cThree Kingdoms\u201d period, a commentarial and collective\nscholarly literature surrounding Confucius (rather than later\nexponents of the tradition such as Mengzi or Xunzi) became popular. A\nnumber of volumes emerged that collected (and added) stories about\nConfucius and extant sayings purported to be of Confucius, from a\nnumber of earlier sources. Two of these volumes, the Kongzi\nJiayu (Discussions of the Confucius School) and Kong\nCongzi (Collected Sayings of Confucius) were compiled just after\nthe end of the Han Dynasty, during the revolts of the Three Kingdoms\nperiod, by the Cao Wei court scholar Wang Su (195\u2013256 CE). This\ncompilation was part of a general concern with and debate surrounding\ncommentaries on the classics. It became common in the modern period to\ndismiss Wang Su\u2019s collections as \u201cforgeries\u201d, but\nthis makes little sense, given that Wang\u2019s compilations drew\ntogether passages from a host of other well-known sources. The\ncommentarial tradition on such texts as the Analects and\nLaozi took hold in the Han, with one of the most famous\ncommentarial collections, the Lunyu Jijie (\u201cCollected\nExplanations of the Analects\u201d) produced by a team of\nCao Wei scholars associated with He Yan, who played a major role in\nthe development of the Xuanxue (Neo-Daoist) movement in the\nWei-Jin period.\n\nA number of other important texts dealing with philosophically\nimportant topics were written or compiled in the Han as well. The\netymological dictionary Shuowen Jiezi of Xu Shen\n(58\u2013147 CE) had a major influence on later understandings of\nimportant philosophical terms, despite its sometimes fanciful and\nquestionable etymologies, and is still consulted today. The\nBaihutong Delun, an account of an important council held in\n58 CE, was compiled by Ban Gu, brother of Ban Zhao and the primary\nauthor of the Han Shu (Book of the Han). In addition, it is\nin the Eastern Han that we see the first references to Buddhism, a\nreligious and philosophical tradition that would come to play an\nenormous role throughout the rest of Chinese history. Though knowledge\nof Buddhist teachings seems to have been relatively limited at the\ntime, we find references to the Buddha as a seemingly Daoist-like\nfigure. In the minister Xiang Kai\u2019s (d. 184 CE) memorial to\nEmperor Huan in 166 CE, recorded in the Hou Han Shu, we find\none of the earliest references to Buddhism. Discussing an image of the\nBuddha found in the palace, Xiang gives a brief account of Buddhist\nviews and links them with the Huang-Lao teachings, focusing on\nemptiness, eliminating desires, and \u201cnon-forced action\u201d\n(wu wei \u7121\u70ba).\n\nMoving into the Three Kingdoms and the Wei and Jin periods, we see the\nrise of Buddhist thought (and philosophy) in China and the development\nof \u201creligious Daoism\u201d, as personal and individual concerns\nstart to take central stage, over the communal and political concerns\nthat had been central to earlier periods of Chinese history. The\nreasons for this shift are not altogether clear, but one plausible\nstory is that the breakdown of Han government and the roots of the\nshift to the internal with its roots in Eastern Han withdrawal and\nculminating in Xuanxue thought of figures like Guo Xiang\n(252\u2013312 CE) and Wang Bi (226\u2013249 CE) are partly\nresponsible for this shift (Holcombe 1994: 87\u201390). Many of the\nconcerns and themes of Eastern Han endure throughout the history of\nChinese thought. Particularly, the conflict between individual\nretirement from worldly concerns (in either Confucian or Buddhist\nmode) and the duty to engage in the social project, as well as\neremeticism as a form of protest, remain major features of Chinese\nintellectual life down to the current day.\n",
