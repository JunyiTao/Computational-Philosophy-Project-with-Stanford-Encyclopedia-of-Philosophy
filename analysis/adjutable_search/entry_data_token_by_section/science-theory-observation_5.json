    "main_text": "Theory and value ladenness || Perception\n3.1 Perception\n\nIf you believe that observation by human sense perception is the\nobjective basis of all scientific knowledge, then you ought to be\nparticularly worried about the potential for human perception to be\ncorrupted by theoretical assumptions, wishful thinking, framing\neffects, and so on. Daston and Galison recount the striking example of\nArthur Worthington\u2019s symmetrical milk drops (2007, 11\u201316).\nWorking in 1875, Worthington investigated the hydrodynamics of falling\nfluid droplets and their evolution upon impacting a hard surface. At\nfirst, he had tried to carefully track the drop dynamics with a strobe\nlight to burn a sequence of images into his own retinas. The images he\ndrew to record what he saw were radially symmetric, with rays of the\ndrop splashes emanating evenly from the center of the impact. However,\nwhen Worthington transitioned from using his eyes and capacity to draw\nfrom memory to using photography in 1894, he was shocked to find that\nthe kind of splashes he had been observing were irregular splats\n(ibid., 13). Even curiouser, when Worthington returned to his\ndrawings, he found that he had indeed recorded some unsymmetrical\nsplashes. He had evidently dismissed them as uninformative accidents\ninstead of regarding them as revelatory of the phenomenon he was\nintent on studying (ibid.) In attempting to document the ideal form of\nthe splashes, a general and regular form, he had subconsciously\ndown-played the irregularity of individual splashes. If theoretical\ncommitments, like Worthington\u2019s initial commitment to the\nperfect symmetry of the physics he was studying, pervasively and\nincorrigibly dictated the results of empirical inquiry, then the\nepistemic aims of science would be seriously undermined.\n\nPerceptual psychologists, Bruner and Postman, found that subjects who\nwere briefly shown anomalous playing cards, e.g., a black four of\nhearts, reported having seen their normal counterparts e.g., a red\nfour of hearts. It took repeated exposures to get subjects to say the\nanomalous cards didn\u2019t look right, and eventually, to describe\nthem correctly (Kuhn 1962, 63). Kuhn took such studies to indicate\nthat things don\u2019t look the same to observers with different\nconceptual resources. (For a more up-to-date discussion of theory and\nconceptual perceptual loading see Lupyan 2015.) If so, black hearts\ndidn\u2019t look like black hearts until repeated exposures somehow\nallowed subjects to acquire the concept of a black heart. By analogy,\nKuhn supposed, when observers working in conflicting paradigms look at\nthe same thing, their conceptual limitations should keep them from\nhaving the same visual experiences (Kuhn 1962, 111,\n113\u2013114, 115, 120\u20131). This would\nmean, for example, that when Priestley and Lavoisier watched the same\nexperiment, Lavoisier should have seen what accorded with his theory\nthat combustion and respiration are oxidation processes, while\nPriestley\u2019s visual experiences should have agreed with his\ntheory that burning and respiration are processes of phlogiston\nrelease.\n\nThe example of Pettersson\u2019s and Rutherford\u2019s scintillation\nscreen evidence (above) attests to the fact that observers working in\ndifferent laboratories sometimes report seeing different things under\nsimilar conditions. It is plausible that their expectations influence\ntheir reports. It is plausible that their expectations are shaped by\ntheir training and by their supervisors\u2019 and associates\u2019\ntheory driven behavior. But as happens in other cases as well, all\nparties to the dispute agreed to reject Pettersson\u2019s data by\nappealing to results that both laboratories could obtain and interpret\nin the same way without compromising their theoretical commitments.\nIndeed, it is possible for scientists to share empirical results, not\njust across diverse laboratory cultures, but even across serious\ndifferences in worldview. Much as they disagreed about the nature of\nrespiration and combustion, Priestley and Lavoisier gave\nquantitatively similar reports of how long their mice stayed alive and\ntheir candles kept burning in closed bell jars. Priestley taught\nLavoisier how to obtain what he took to be measurements of the\nphlogiston content of an unknown gas. A sample of the gas to be tested\nis run into a graduated tube filled with water and inverted over a\nwater bath. After noting the height of the water remaining in the\ntube, the observer adds \u201cnitrous air\u201d (we call it nitric\noxide) and checks the water level again. Priestley, who thought there\nwas no such thing as oxygen, believed the change in water level\nindicated how much phlogiston the gas contained. Lavoisier reported\nobserving the same water levels as Priestley even after he abandoned\nphlogiston theory and became convinced that changes in water level\nindicated free oxygen content (Conant 1957,\n74\u2013109).\n\nA related issue is that of salience. Kuhn claimed that if Galileo and\nan Aristotelian physicist had watched the same pendulum experiment,\nthey would not have looked at or attended to the same things. The\nAristotelian\u2019s paradigm would have required the experimenter to\nmeasure\n\n\u2026 the weight of the stone, the vertical height to which it had\nbeen raised, and the time required for it to achieve rest (Kuhn 1962,\n123)\n\n\nand ignore radius, angular displacement, and time per swing (ibid.,\n124). These last were salient to Galileo because he treated pendulum\nswings as constrained circular motions. The Galilean quantities would\nbe of no interest to an Aristotelian who treats the stone as falling\nunder constraint toward the center of the earth (ibid., 123). Thus\nGalileo and the Aristotelian would not have collected the same data.\n(Absent records of Aristotelian pendulum experiments we can think of\nthis as a thought experiment.)\n\nInterests change, however. Scientists may eventually come to\nappreciate the significance of data that had not originally been\nsalient to them in light of new presuppositions. The moral of these\nexamples is that although paradigms or theoretical commitments\nsometimes have an epistemically significant influence on what\nobservers perceive or what they attend to, it can be relatively easy\nto nullify or correct for their effects. When presuppositions cause\nepistemic damage, investigators are often able to eventually make\ncorrections. Thus, paradigms and theoretical commitments actually do\ninfluence saliency, but their influence is neither inevitable nor\nirremediable.\n",
