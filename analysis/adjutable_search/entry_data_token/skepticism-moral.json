Varieties of Moral Skepticism\n\n\nMoral skeptics differ in many ways (cf. Machuca 2017), but they share a common core that\nmakes them all moral skeptics. What makes moral skepticism\nmoral is that it concerns morality rather than other\ntopics. Moral skeptics might go on to be skeptics about the external\nworld or about other minds or about induction or about all beliefs or\nabout all norms or normative beliefs, but these other skepticisms are\nnot entailed by moral skepticism alone.\n\n\nWhat makes moral skeptics skeptics is that they raise doubts\nabout common beliefs. Moral skeptics then differ in the kinds of\ncommon beliefs that they doubt. They might, for example, doubt\ncategorical or absolute moral beliefs without doubting weaker kinds of\nmoral beliefs. Moral skeptics also differ in the kinds of doubts that\nthey raise. Since general skepticism is an epistemological view about\nthe limits of knowledge or justified belief, the most central version\nof moral skepticism is the one that raises doubts about moral\nknowledge or justified moral belief.\n\n\nThere are two main traditions in epistemological skepticism. One\ntradition makes the claim that nobody ever knows or can know\nanything. This claim is sometimes named Cartesian skepticism\n(although Descartes argued against it) or Academic skepticism\n(despite other interpretations of skeptics in the ancient\nAcademy). For lack of a better description, we can call\nit dogmatic skepticism, because such skeptics dogmatically\nassert a universal claim. In contrast, no such claim is made\nby Pyrrhonian skeptics. They also don\u2019t deny any claim like\nthis. They have so much doubt that they refrain from taking any\nposition one way or the other on whether anyone does or does not or\ncan or cannot know anything.\n\n\nMoral skepticism comes in two corresponding varieties. Pyrrhonian\nskeptics about moral knowledge refuse to admit that some people\nsometimes know that some substantive moral belief is true. They doubt\nthat moral knowledge is possible. Still, they do not go on to make the\nopposite claim that moral knowledge is impossible. They doubt that,\ntoo. Their doubts are so extreme that they do not make any claim one\nway or the other about the actuality or possibility of moral\nknowledge. Parallel views can be adopted regarding justified moral\nbelief. Pyrrhonian skeptics about justified moral belief\nsuspend or withhold belief about the actuality or possibility of any\njustified moral belief.\n\n\nIn contrast, dogmatic moral skeptics make definite claims\nabout the epistemic status of moral beliefs:\n\nDogmatic skepticism about moral knowledge is the claim that nobody\never knows that any substantive moral belief is true (cf. Butchvarov\n1989, 2).\n\n\n\nSome moral skeptics add this related claim:\n\nDogmatic skepticism about justified moral belief is the claim that\nnobody is ever justified in holding any substantive moral belief.\n\n\n\n(The relevant way of being justified is specified in\nSinnott-Armstrong 2006, chap. 4.) These two claims and Pyrrhonian moral\nskepticism all fall under the general heading of epistemological\nmoral skepticism.\n\n\nThe relation between these two claims depends on the nature of\nknowledge. If knowledge implies justified belief, as is traditionally\nsupposed, then skepticism about justified moral belief implies\nskepticism about moral knowledge. However, even if knowledge does\nrequire justified belief, it does not require only justified\nbelief, so skepticism about moral knowledge does not imply skepticism\nabout justified moral belief.\n\n\nOne reason is that knowledge implies truth, but justified belief does\nnot. Thus, if moral beliefs cannot be true, they can never be known to\nbe true, but they still might be justified in some way that is\nindependent of truth. As a result, skepticism about moral knowledge is\nimplied, but skepticism about justified moral belief is not implied,\nby yet another form of moral skepticism:\n\nSkepticism about moral truth is the claim that no\nsubstantive moral belief is true.\n \n\n\nThis claim is usually based on one of three more specific claims:\n\n\nSkepticism about moral truth-aptness is the claim that no\nsubstantive moral belief is the kind of thing that could be either true or false.\n\nSkepticism about moral truth-value is the claim that no\nsubstantive moral belief is either true or false (although some moral\nbeliefs are the kind of thing that could be true or false).\n\nSkepticism with moral falsehood is the claim that every\nsubstantive moral belief is false.\n\n\n\nThese last three kinds of moral skepticism are not epistemological,\nfor they are not directly about knowledge or justification. Instead,\nthey are about truth, so they are usually based on views of moral\nlanguage or metaphysics.\n\n\nSome philosophers of language argue that sentences like\n\u201cCheating is morally wrong\u201d are neither true nor false,\nbecause they resemble pure expressions of emotion (such as \u201cBoo\nKnicks\u201d) or prescriptions for action (such as \u201cGo\nCeltics\u201d). Such expressions and prescriptions are kinds of thing\nthat cannot be either true or false. Thus, if these analogies hold in\nall relevant respects, then substantive moral beliefs are also not the\nright kind of thing to be either true or false. They are not apt for\nevaluation in terms of truth. For this reason, such linguistic\ntheories are often taken to imply skepticism about moral\ntruth-aptness. Views of this general sort are defended by Ayer (1952),\nStevenson (1944), Hare (1981), Gibbard (1990; cf. 2003), and Blackburn\n(1993), although recent versions often allow some minimal kind of\nmoral truth while denying that moral beliefs can be true or false in\nthe same robust way as factual beliefs.\n\n\nSuch views are often described as non-cognitivism. That label\nis misleading, because etymology suggests that cognitivism is about\ncognition, which is knowledge. Since knowledge implies truth,\nskepticism about moral truth-aptness has implications for moral\nknowledge, but it is directly about truth-aptness and not about moral\nknowledge.\n\n\nWhatever you call it, skepticism about moral truth-aptness runs into\nseveral problems. If moral assertions have no truth-value, then it is\nhard to see how they can fit into truth-functional contexts, such as\nnegation, disjunction, and conditionals (Sinnott-Armstrong 2000). Such contexts are also\nunassertive, so they do not express the same emotions or prescriptions\nas when moral claims are asserted. Indeed, no particular emotion or\nprescription seems to be expressed when someone says, \u201cEating\nmeat is not morally wrong\u201d (cf. Schroeder 2010). Expressivists\nand prescriptivists respond to such objections, but their responses\nremain controversial (cf.  Sinnott-Armstrong 2006, chap. 2).\n\n\nMany moral theorists conclude that moral assertions express not only\nemotions or prescriptions but also beliefs. In particular,\nthey express beliefs that certain acts, institutions, or people have\ncertain moral properties (such as moral rightness or wrongness) or\nbeliefs in moral facts (such as the fact that a certain act is morally\nright or wrong). This non-skeptical linguistic analysis still does not\nshow that such moral claims can be true, since assertions can express\nbeliefs that are false or neither true nor false. Indeed, all\nsubstantive moral assertions and beliefs are false (or neither true\nnor false) if they claim (or semantically presuppose) moral facts or\nproperties, and if this metaphysical thesis holds:\n\nSkepticism about moral reality is the claim that no moral\nfacts or properties exist.\n \n\n\nSkepticism about moral reality is, thus, a reason for skepticism with\nmoral falsehood, as developed by Mackie (1977), or skepticism about\nmoral truth-value, as developed by Joyce (2001). Opponents of\nsuch error theories often object that some moral beliefs must\nbe true because some moral beliefs deny the truth of other moral\nbeliefs. However, error theorists can allow a negative moral belief\n(such as that eating meat is\nnot morally wrong) to be true, but only if it merely denies\nthe truth of the corresponding positive moral belief (that eating meat\nis morally wrong). If such denials of moral beliefs are not\nsubstantive moral beliefs (as denials of astrological beliefs are not\nastrology), then error theorists can maintain that all\nsubstantive moral beliefs are false or neither true nor false.\n\n\nError theorists and skeptics about moral truth-aptness disagree about\nthe content of moral assertions, but they still agree that no substantive moral\nclaim or belief is true, so they are both skeptics about moral\ntruth. None of these skeptical theses is implied by either skepticism\nabout moral knowledge or skepticism about justified moral\nbelief. Some moral claims might be true, even if we cannot know or\nhave justified beliefs about which ones are true. However, a converse\nimplication seems to hold: If knowledge implies truth, and if moral\nclaims are never true, then there is no knowledge of what is moral or\nimmoral (assuming that skeptics deny the same kind of truth that\nknowledge requires). Nonetheless, since the implication holds in only\none direction, skepticism about moral truth is still distinct from\nall kinds of epistemological moral skepticism.\n\n\nYet another non-epistemological form of moral skepticism answers the\nquestion \u201cWhy be moral?\u201d This question is used to raise\nmany different issues. Almost everyone admits that there\nis sometimes some kind of reason to be moral. However, many\nphilosophers deny various universal claims, including the claims that\nthere is always some reason to be moral, that there is always\na distinctively\nmoral (as opposed to self-interested) reason to be moral,\nand/or that there is always enough reason to make it\nirrational not to be moral or at least not irrational to be moral.\nThese distinct denials can be seen as separate forms of practical\nmoral skepticism, which are discussed in more detail in the\nfollowing supplementary document:\n\nSupplement on Practical Moral Skepticism\n\n\n\nPractical moral skepticism resembles epistemological moral skepticism\nin that both kinds of skepticism deny a role to reasons in\nmorality. However, epistemological moral skepticism is about reasons\nfor belief, whereas practical moral skepticism is about\nreasons for action. Moreover, practical moral skeptics\nusually deny that there is always enough reason for moral\naction, whereas epistemological moral skeptics usually deny that\nthere is ever an adequate reason for moral\nbelief. Consequently, practical moral skepticism does not imply\nepistemological moral skepticism. Some moral theorists do assume that\na reason to believe that an act is immoral cannot be adequate unless\nit also provides a reason not to do that act. However, even if the\ntwo kinds of reasons are related in this way, they are still\ndistinct, so practical moral skepticism must not be confused with\nepistemological moral skepticism.\n\n\nOverall, then, we need to distinguish the following kinds of\nepistemological moral skepticism:\n\n\nDogmatic skepticism about moral knowledge = nobody ever knows that\nany substantive moral belief is true.\n\nDogmatic skepticism about justified moral belief = nobody is ever\njustified in holding any substantive moral belief.\n\nPyrrhonian skepticism about moral knowledge withholds assent from\nboth dogmatic skepticism about moral knowledge and its denial.\n\nPyrrhonian skepticism about justified moral belief withholds assent from\nboth dogmatic skepticism about justified moral belief and its denial.\n\n\n\nWe also need to distinguish these epistemological moral skepticisms\nfrom several non-epistemological kinds of moral skepticism:\n\n\nSkepticism about moral truth = no substantive\nmoral belief is true.\n\nSkepticism about moral truth-aptness = no\nsubstantive moral belief is the kind of thing that could be either true or false.\n\nSkepticism about moral truth-value = no substantive moral\nbelief is either true or false (although some moral beliefs are the\nkind of thing that could be true or false).\n\nSkepticism with moral falsehood = every substantive moral belief is false.\n\nSkepticism about moral reality = no moral properties or facts exist.\n\nPractical moral skepticism = there is not always any or\nenough or distinctively moral reason to be moral.\n\n\n These kinds of moral skepticism can be diagrammed as follows:\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\n Skepticism about justified moral belief will be the primary topic for\nthe rest of this entry, and I will refer to it henceforth simply as\nmoral skepticism.\n2. A Presumption Against Moral Skepticism?\n\n\nOpponents often accuse moral skepticism of leading to immorality.\nHowever, skeptics about justified moral belief can act well and be\nnice people. They need not be any less motivated to be moral, nor\nneed they have (or believe in) any less reason to be moral than\nnon-skeptics have (or believe in). Moral skeptics can hold\nsubstantive moral beliefs just as strongly as non-skeptics. Their\nsubstantive moral beliefs can be common and plausible ones. Moral\nskeptics can even believe that their moral beliefs are true by virtue\nof corresponding to an independent moral reality. All that moral\nskeptics need to deny or doubt in order to be moral skeptics is that their (or anyone\u2019s) moral beliefs are\njustified. This meta-ethical position about the epistemic status of\nmoral beliefs need not trickle down and infect anyone\u2019s\nsubstantive moral beliefs or actions.\n\n Critics still argue that moral skepticism conflicts with\ncommon sense. Most people think that they are justified in holding\nmany moral beliefs, such as that it is morally wrong to beat your\nopponent senseless with a baseball bat just because she beat you in a\nbaseball game. People also claim moral knowledge, such as when a\nneighbor says, \u201cI know that it is wrong for him to spank his daughter\nso hard, but I don\u2019t know what I should do about it.\u201d Moral\nskepticism conflicts with these common ways of talking and thinking,\nso moral skeptics seem to owe us some argument for their controversial claim.\n\n\nDogmatic moral skepticism is, moreover, a universal and abstruse claim. It is\nthe claim that all moral beliefs have a certain epistemic status.\nNormally one should not make such a strong claim without some reason.\nOne should not, for example, claim that all astronomical beliefs are\nunjustified unless one has some reason for this claim. Analogously,\nit seems that one should not claim that all moral beliefs are\nunjustified unless one has some positive argument. Thus, its form,\nlike its conflict with common sense, seems to create a presumption\nagainst moral skepticism.\n\n\nMoral skeptics, in response, sometimes try to shift the burden of\nproof to their opponents. Anyone who makes the positive moral claim\nthat sodomy is morally wrong seems to need some reason for\nthat claim, just as someone who claims that there is life on Mars\nseems to need evidence for that claim. If the presumption is always\nagainst those who make positive moral claims, then it is opponents of\nmoral skepticism who must carry the burden of proof. Or, at least,\nmoral skeptics can deny that the burden of proof is on moral\nskeptics. Then moral skeptics may criticize any moral belief or\ntheory without needing to offer any positive argument for moral\nskepticism, and their opponents need to take moral skepticism\nseriously enough to argue against it (cf. Copp 1991).\n\n\nThis controversy about burden of proof might be resolved by\ndistinguishing dogmatic moral skepticism from Pyrrhonian moral\nskepticism. Dogmatic skeptics about justified moral belief\nmake a universal claim that conflicts with common sense, so they seem\nto have the burden of arguing for their claim. In contrast,\nPyrrhonian moral skeptics neither make nor deny any claim about the\nepistemic status of any moral belief. They simply raise doubts about\nwhether moral beliefs are ever justified. This difference suggests\nthat Pyrrhonian moral skeptics do not take on any or as much burden of proof\nas do dogmatic skeptics about justified moral belief.\n3. Arguments for Moral Skepticism\n\n\nWhether or not they need to, moral skeptics do offer a variety of\narguments for their position. Here I will focus on arguments for\ndogmatic skepticism about justified moral belief, but\nessentially the same arguments could be formulated to support dogmatic\nskepticism about moral knowledge. I will return later to Pyrrhonian\nmoral skepticism in section 4. Also, although here I will sometimes formulate these\narguments in terms of moral truth for simplicity, they could be restated in ways more\ncongenial to skeptics about moral truth-aptness.\n3.1 Moral Disagreements\n\n\nThe simplest and most common argument for moral skepticism is based\non observed facts: Smart and well-meaning people disagree about the\nmoral permissibility of abortion, affirmative action, capital\npunishment, active euthanasia, nuclear deterrence, welfare reform,\ncivil rights, and so on. Many observers generalize to the conclusion\nthat no moral claim is or would be accepted by everyone.\n However, all of these disagreements together still do not exclude\nthe possibility of agreement on other moral beliefs. Maybe nobody\ndenies that it is morally wrong to torture babies just to get sexual\npleasure. Moreover, even if no moral belief is immune to disagreement,\nthe fact that some people disagree with me does not prove that I am\nunjustified in holding my moral belief. I might be able to show them\nthat I am right, or they might agree with me under ideal\ncircumstances, where they are better informed, more thoughtful, less\npartial, and so on. Moral disagreements that are resolvable do not\nsupport moral skepticism, so any argument for moral skepticism from\nmoral disagreement must show that moral disagreements are unresolvable\non every issue. That will require a separate argument. (For further\ndiscussions, see Bergmann & Kain 2014, Besong 2014, and Vavova\n2014.) \n3.2 Moral Explanations\n\n\nAnother way to argue for moral skepticism is to cite a requirement on\njustified belief. On one view, we cannot be justified in believing any\nclaim unless the truth of that claim is necessary for the best\nexplanation of some independent fact. Some philosophers then argue\nthat moral truths are never necessary for the best explanation of any\nnon-moral fact (cf. Harman 1977). It follows that we cannot be\njustified in believing any moral claim (cf. Hill 2016).\n\n\nThis argument can be countered in two ways. First, one could deny\nthat justified belief must always involve inference to the best\nexplanation. It is not clear, for example, that beliefs about\nmathematics or colors are or must be grounded in this way, although\nsuch beliefs still seem justified. (Compare Harman 1977 on\nmathematics and color.)\n\n\nAnother common response is that sometimes a moral truth is necessary\nfor the best explanation of a non-moral fact (cf. Sturgeon 1985).\nHitler\u2019s vices are sometimes cited to explain his atrocities.\nSlavery\u2019s injustice has been said to explain its demise. And the\nfact that everyone agrees that it is morally wrong to torture babies\njust to get sexual pleasure might be best explained by the fact that\nthis common belief is true.\n\n\nMoral skeptics usually reply that such explanations can be replaced\nby non-moral descriptions of Hitler, slavery, and torture. If such\nreplacements are always available, then moral truths are not\nnecessary for the best explanation of anything. However, it is not\nclear whether or not non-moral explanations really do work as well as\nmoral explanations in all cases. Nor is it clear whether inference to\nthe best explanation must lie behind all justified belief.\n\nA special case of this argument, called an evolutionary debunking\nargument, has led to vigorous debate recently (cf. Kahane 2011, May 2018). \nSome moral skeptics (or\nat least skeptics about moral realism) argue that moral beliefs can be\nexplained by evolutionary biology perhaps with help from psychology,\nsociology, or culture without appeal to any moral fact or truth. Such\ntruth-independent explanations are then supposed to show that moral\nbeliefs are either not true, not really (mind independently) true, or\nnot justified (cf. Joyce 2006, Street 2006, Braddock 2017). As\nwith other arguments from the explanatory impotence of moral facts,\ncritics can reply either by arguing that moral facts do some\nexplanatory work (e.g. Copp 2008 with reply by Street 2008) or by\narguing that moral beliefs can be justified even if moral facts do not\ndo any explanatory work (cf. Bergmann & Kain 2014).\n3.3 A Regress\n\n\nThe next argument develops a skeptical regress. This form of argument,\nwhich derives from Sextus Empiricus (Outlines of Scepticism),\nis sometimes used to support the more general skeptical claim that no\nbelief about any topic is justified. Nonetheless, it might seem to\nhave special force within morality if supposedly foundational moral\nbeliefs are especially problematic in some way.\n\n\nThe argument\u2019s goal is to rule out all of the ways in which a\nperson might be justified in believing something. It starts with a\ndefinition:\n\nA person S is inferentially justified in believing\na claim that p if and only if what makes S justified\nis (at least in part) S\u2019s ability to infer p\nfrom some belief of S.\n\n\n\nNotice that what matters for this way of being justified is not whether the person actually bases the moral belief on an occurrent inference but only whether the person is able to infer that moral belief. This ability is usually understood to be present when the person has other beliefs that fit into a structure that the person could use to infer the moral belief.\n\n\nThere are, then, only two ways to be justified:\n\n(1) If any person S is justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p, then S must be justified either\ninferentially or non-inferentially.\n\n\n\nThe moral skeptic denies both possibilities in turn. First:\n\n(2) No person S is ever non-inferentially justified in\nbelieving any moral claim that p.\n\n\n\nMoral intuitionists and some moral contextualists deny premise (2),\nbut moral skeptics argue that too many beliefs would be justified if\npeople did not need to be able to provide any reason or inference to support their moral\nbeliefs. If Thelma could be non-inferentially justified in believing\nthat eating meat is morally wrong, then Louise could also be\nnon-inferentially justified in believing that eating meat is\nnot morally wrong, and Nick could be non-inferentially justified in\nbelieving that it is morally wrong to eat vegetables. Conflicting\nbeliefs can sometimes both be justified, but it seems less plausible\nto hold that such conflicting moral beliefs are all justified without\nany ability to support the belief with any inference when each believer knows that other people disagree. If\nsuch conflicting beliefs are not justified in the absence of a\nreason, and if such conflicts are pervasive enough to undermine all\nnon-inferential justification, then premise (2) is true.\n\n\nAnother way to argue for premise (2) invokes science. Psychologists\nhave found that many moral judgments are subject to a variety of\ndistorting influences, including framing effects and certain\nmisleading emotions. Biologists then suggest that moral judgments\nevolved in ways that seem independent of their truth. Such indications\nof unreliability are supposed to show that moral judgments are not\njustified without inference (Sinnott-Armstrong 2006, Chapter 9,\npp. 184\u2013219; but see replies by Beaulieu 2009, van Roojen\n2013, and May 2018). That would support premise (2).\n\n Premises (1) and (2) together imply an intermediate conclusion:\n\n(3) If any person S is justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p, then S must be justified\ninferentially.\n\n\n\nThis means that, to be justified, S must be able to infer\np from some other beliefs held by S. \nOf course, S does not have to draw any actual inference, \nbut S still needs to hold some other beliefs that could be used to justify that belief. \n\n\nBut which\nother beliefs? There are three main possibilities:\n\n(4) If any person S is inferentially justified in believing\nany moral claim that p, then S must be justified by an\ninference with either (a) no normative premises or (b) some normative\npremises but no moral premises or (c) some moral premises.\n\n\n\nTo the first possibility, moral skeptics respond with a variation on\nthe maxim that you can\u2019t get \u201cought\u201d from \u201cis\u201d:\n\n(5) No person S is ever justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p by an inference with no normative premises.\n\n\n\nNaturalists in moral epistemology deny (5) when they try to derive a\nconclusion that an act is morally wrong from purely non-normative\nfeatures of the act. However, moral skeptics retort that such\nderivations always depend on a suppressed premise that all acts with\nthose features are morally wrong. Such a suppressed premise seems\nmoral and, hence, normative. If so, the naturalist\u2019s inference\ndoes not really work without any normative premises. Naturalists\nstill might invoke inferences to the best moral explanation, but then\nmoral skeptics can deny that any moral hypothesis provides the best\nexplanation independently of prior moral assumptions (see above).\n\n\nThe next possibility is to justify a moral conclusion with an\ninference whose premises are not moral but are normative in another\nway. This approach, which is adopted by contractarians among others,\ncan be called normativism. Normativists usually start with\npremises about rationality and impartiality that are each supposed to\nbe normative but morally neutral. If rational impartial people under\nrelevant circumstances would agree to certain moral standards, this\nis supposed to show that the corresponding moral beliefs are true or\njustified.\n\n\nOne problem for this general approach is that different theories of\nrationality, impartiality, and relevant circumstances are all\nquestionable and lead to contrary moral beliefs. This suggests that\nsuch theories are not morally neutral, so these derivations do not\navoid moral premises. Other arguments from non-moral norms to moral\nconclusions run into similar problems. Moral skeptics conclude\nthat:\n\n(6) No person S is ever justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p by an inference with some normative premises but\nno moral premises.\n\n\n\nPremises (4)\u2013(6) imply another intermediate conclusion:\n\n(7) If any person S is justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p, then S must be justified by an\ninference with some moral premise.\n\n\n\nIn short, moral beliefs must be justified by moral beliefs.\n\n\nThis creates a problem. Although the justifying beliefs must include\nsome moral beliefs, not just any moral beliefs will do:\n\n(8) No person S is ever justified in believing a moral\nclaim that p by an inference with a moral premise unless\nS is also justified in believing that moral premise\nitself.\n\n\n\nPremise (8) is denied by some contextualists, who claim that, even\nif a moral belief is not justified, if it is shared within a certain\nsocial context, then it may be used to justify other moral beliefs (cf. Wellman 1971, Timmons 1999).\nHowever, moral skeptics reply that social contexts are often corrupt,\nand no social context by itself can show that a moral belief is true,\nreliable, or, hence, justified in the relevant way.\n\n\nBut then how can moral premises be justified? Given (7)\u2013(8), the\nmoral premises must be justified by inferring them from still other\nmoral beliefs which must also be justified by inferring them from still\nother moral beliefs, and so on. To justify a moral belief thus requires\na chain (or branching tree) of justifying beliefs or premises, which must\nhave one of two forms:\n\n(9) If any person S is justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p, then S must be justified by a chain of\ninferences that either goes on infinitely or circles back to include\np itself as an essential premise.\n\n\n\nThe first of these two alternatives is almost never defended, since\nmost accept:\n\n(10) No person S is ever justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p by a chain of inferences that goes on\ninfinitely.\n\n\n\nMoral skeptics also deny the other possibility:\n\n(11) No person S is ever justified in believing any moral\nclaim that p by a chain of inferences that includes p\nas an essential premise.\n\n\n\nAny argument that includes its conclusion as a premise will be\nvalid. However, anyone who doubts the conclusion will have just as much\nreason to doubt the premise. So, according to skeptics, nothing is\ngained when a premise just restates the belief to be justified.\n\n\nPremise (11) is opposed by moral coherentists (e.g. Brink 1989, Sayre-McCord 1996, \nSinnott-Armstrong 2006, Chapter 10, pp. 220\u2013251). Recent coherentists\nemphasize that they do not infer a belief from itself in a linear way.\nInstead, a moral belief is supposed to be justified because it coheres\nin some way with a body of beliefs that is coherent in some\nway. Still, moral skeptics deny that coherence is enough to make a\nmoral belief justified. One reason is that the internal coherence of a\nset of beliefs is not evidence of any relation to anything outside the\nbeliefs. Another reason is that every belief \u2014 no matter how\nridiculous \u2014 can cohere with some body of beliefs that is\ninternally coherent. Because so many incompatible systems seem\ncoherent, moral skeptics deny that coherence alone is sufficient to\nmake beliefs justified.\n\n\nNow the moral skeptic can draw a final conclusion. (9)\u2013(11)\nimply:\n\n (12) No person is ever justified in believing any moral\nclaim.\n\n\n\nThis is dogmatic skepticism about justified moral beliefs.\n\n\nMany opponents find this conclusion implausible, but the regress\nargument is valid. Hence, its conclusion cannot be avoided without\ndenying one of its premises. Different opponents of moral skepticism\ndeny different premises, as indicated. However, it remains to be\nseen whether any of these responses to the regress argument is\ndefensible in the end.\n3.4 Skeptical Hypotheses\n\n\nThe final kind of argument derives from Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n(1641). I do not seem justified in believing that what I see is a\nlake if I cannot rule out the possibility that it is a bay or a\nbayou.  Generalizing, if there is any contrary hypothesis that I\ncannot rule out, then I am not justified in believing that what I see\nis a lake.  This is supposed to be a common standard for justified\nbelief. When this principle is applied thoroughly, it leads to\nskepticism. All a skeptic needs to show is that, for each belief,\nthere is some contrary hypothesis that cannot be ruled out. It need\nnot be the same hypothesis for every belief, but skeptics usually buy\nwholesale instead of retail, so they seek a single hypothesis that is\ncontrary to all (or many common) beliefs and which cannot be ruled\nout in any way.\n\n\nThe famous Cartesian hypothesis is of a demon who deceives me in all\nof my beliefs about the external world, while also ensuring that my\nbeliefs are completely coherent. This possibility cannot be ruled out\nby any experiences or beliefs, because of how the deceiving demon is\ndefined. This hypothesis is also contrary to my beliefs about the\nlake.  So my beliefs about the lake are not justified, according to\nthe above principle. And there is nothing special about my beliefs\nabout the lake. Everything I believe about the external world is\nincompatible with the deceiving demon hypothesis. Skeptics conclude\nthat no such belief is justified.\n\n\nThis argument is often dismissed on the grounds that there is no\nreason to believe in a deceiving demon or that nobody really doubts\nwhether there is an external world. In contrast, this form of argument is not subject to such objections when it is applied to morality, because some people really do\nadopt and even argue for a parallel skeptical hypothesis in\nmorality:\n\n Moral Nihilism = Nothing is morally wrong.\n\n\n\nMoral nihilism here is not about what is semantically or\nmetaphysically possible. It is just a substantive, negative,\nexistential claim that there does not exist anything that is morally\nwrong. It is, however, usually supplemented with an explanation of why\npeople hold moral beliefs that are false (just as the story of\nDescartes\u2019s deceiving demon is supposed to explain why our perceptual\nbeliefs are false). This thesis of moral nihilism has been supported\nby various reasons, including the pervasiveness of moral disagreement\nand our supposed ability (with the help of sociobiology and other\nsciences) to explain moral beliefs without reference to moral\nfacts. Since people do take moral nihilism seriously and even argue\nfor it (Mackie 1977, Joyce 2001), moral nihilism cannot be dismissed\nas readily as Descartes\u2019s deceiving demon.\n\n\nMoral skeptics can then argue that the definition of moral nihilism\nforestalls any refutation. Since moral nihilists question all of our\nbeliefs in moral wrongness, they leave us with no starting points on\nwhich to base arguments against them without begging the question at\nissue. Moreover, moral nihilists\u2019 explanations of our moral beliefs\npredict that we would hold exactly these moral beliefs, so the truth\nof its predictions can hardly refute moral nihilism. If this trick\nworks, then it fits right into a skeptical hypothesis argument.\n\n\nThis argument is clearest when applied to an example. If nothing is\nmorally wrong, as moral nihilists claim, then it is not morally wrong\nto torture babies just for fun. So, according to the general principle\nabove, one must be able to rule out moral nihilism in order to be\njustified in believing that torturing babies just for fun is morally\nwrong. Moral skeptics conclude that this moral belief is not\njustified. More precisely:\n\n\n(1) I am not justified in believing the denial of moral nihilism.\n\n\n(2) I am justified in believing that [(p) \u201cIt is morally wrong\nto torture babies just for fun\u201d entails (q) the denial of\nmoral nihilism].\n\n\n(3) If I am justified in believing that p, and I am justified\nin believing that p entails q, then I am justified\nin believing that q.\n\n\n(4) Therefore, I am not justified in believing that it is morally\nwrong to torture babies just for fun.\n\n\n\nThis moral belief is not especially problematic in any way. It seems\nas obvious as any moral belief. So the argument can be generalized to\ncover any moral belief. Moral skeptics conclude that no moral belief\nis justified.\n\n\nThere are two main responses to such skeptical hypothesis arguments\n(cf. May 2013).  First, some anti-skeptics deny (1) and claim that\nskeptical hypotheses can be ruled out somehow. They might argue that\nmoral nihilism is internally inconsistent or meaningless. If so, it\ncan be ruled out by logic and semantics alone. However, moral nihilism\ndoes seem consistent and meaningful, according to all plausible\ntheories of moral language, including expressivism, realism, and\nconstructivism (Sinnott-Armstrong 2006, chap. 3). Moral nihilism is\nalso not subject to the kind of argument that Putnam (1981) deploys\nagainst more general skeptical scenarios. Anti-skeptics still might\nargue that moral nihilism is incompatible with some non-moral facts or\nobservations or their best explanations. If so, it can be ruled out by\narguments with only non-moral premises. However, all such attempts to\ncross the dreaded is-ought gap are questionable (Sinnott-Armstrong\n2006, chaps. 7\u20138). A third way to rule out moral nihilism would be\nbased on common moral beliefs that are incompatible with moral\nnihilism. However, just as it would beg the question to use common\nbeliefs about the external world to rule out a deceiving demon\nhypothesis, so it would also beg the question to argue against moral\nnihilism on the basis of common moral beliefs \u2014 no matter how\nobvious those beliefs might seem to us, and no matter how well these\ncommon beliefs cohere together (Sinnott-Armstrong 2006,\nchaps. 9\u201310). Moral skeptics conclude that there is no way to rule out\nmoral nihilism, just as premise (1) claims.\n\n\nAnother recent response is to deny premise (3). This is a principle of\nclosure. Since a belief entails the denial of every contrary\nhypothesis, this closure principle in effect says that I cannot be\njustified in believing p unless I am justified in denying\nevery hypothesis contrary to p \u2014 that is, unless I can\nrule out all contrary hypotheses. This principle has been\ndenied by relevant alternative theorists, who claim instead that only\nrelevant hypotheses need to be ruled out. On this theory, if skeptical\nhypotheses are not relevant, then a belief that it is morally wrong to\ntorture babies just for fun can be justified, even if the believer\ncannot rule out moral nihilism.\n\n\nFor this response to have force, however, opponents of moral\nskepticism need to say why moral nihilism is irrelevant. It seems\nrelevant, for the simple reason that it is directly contrary to the\nmoral belief that is supposed to be justified. Moreover, real people\nbelieve and give reasons to believe in moral nihilism. Some people are\nled to moral nihilism by the absence of any defensible theory of\nmorality. If consequentialism is absurd or incoherent, as some critics\nargue, and if deontological restrictions and permissions are\nmysterious and unfounded, as their opponents argue, then some people\nmight believe moral nihilism for reasons similar to those that led\nscientists to reject phlogiston. Another basis for moral nihilism\ncites science. If all of our moral beliefs can be explained by\nsociobiology and/or other social sciences without assuming that any\nmoral belief is true, then some might accept moral nihilism for\nreasons similar to those that lead many people to reject witches or\nelves. The point is not that such reasons for moral nihilism are\nadequate. The point here is only that there is enough prima facie\nreason to believe moral nihilism that it cannot be dismissed as\nirrelevant on this basis. If moral nihilism is relevant, and if\nclosure holds for all or at least relevant alternatives, and if moral\nnihilism cannot be ruled out in any way, then moral skepticism seems\nto follow.\n3.5 Relations Among the Arguments\n\n\nThese arguments for moral skepticism differ in many ways, but they\nseem mutually supportive. One crucial premise in the skeptical\nhypothesis argument claims that nothing can rule out moral nihilism.\nThe best way to support that premise is to criticize each method for\nruling out moral nihilism. That is just one instance of what the\nregress argument does more generally. The argument from moral\nexplanations excludes yet another way to rule out moral nihilism. So,\nif these other arguments work, they support a crucial premise in the\nskeptical hypothesis argument.\n\n\nConversely, one crucial premise in the regress argument claims that no\nmoral belief can be justified non-inferentially. Another crucial\npremise, (8), claims that an inference cannot justify its conclusion\nunless its premises are justified. These premises claim, in effect,\nthat a moral belief needs a certain kind of justification. One way to\nestablish this need is to point to a contrary possibility that is not\nyet ruled out. That is what the skeptical hypothesis argument does.\nAnother way to confirm this need is to show that the moral belief is\ncontroversial. That is what the argument from moral disagreement does.\nThus, if these other arguments work, they support a crucial premise in\nthe regress argument.\n\n\nTo skeptics, this mutual support might seem desirable.  Anti-skeptics,\nhowever, might object that this mutual support makes the arguments\njointly circular. In the end, the force of the arguments depends on\nthe defensibility of non-skeptical views in moral epistemology. If\nmoral intuitionism, coherentism, naturalism, or normativism works to\njustify some moral beliefs and/or to rule out moral nihilism, then\nthis will undermine the crucial premises in the arguments for moral\nskepticism. But that remains to be seen.\n4. Pyrrhonian Moral Skepticism\n\n\nAlthough the arguments for moral skepticism are hard to refute, most\npeople reject their conclusion. This makes it natural to seek some\ncompromise. Various compromises have been proposed, but here I will\nfocus on one that extends the Pyrrhonian tradition (cf. DePaul 2009).\n\n\nThis neo-Pyrrhonian position can be explained in terms of contrast\nclasses, which should be familiar from shopping: Are jumbo shrimp\nlarge? An answer of \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d would be too\nsimple. Jumbo shrimp are large for shrimp, but they are not large for\nedible crustaceans. Analogously, someone can be justified in believing\na claim out of one contrast class, even if the same person is not\njustified in believing the same claim out of a different contrast\nclass. For example, suppose a father sees an animal in a zoo and\nbelieves it to be a zebra. If the father has adequate evidence that\nthe animal is not a lion or a horse, then the father can be justified\nin believing that it is a zebra out of the contrast class {lion,\nhorse, zebra}. Nonetheless, the father still might not have any\nevidence that the animal is not a mule painted to look just like a\nzebra. Then the father is not justified in believing that the animal\nis a zebra out of the contrast class {lion, horse, zebra, painted\nmule}.\n\n\nThe same situation arises with moral beliefs. A father might be\njustified in believing that he should tell his children the truth\nrather than lying to them, even if the father is not justified in\nbelieving that he should tell his children the truth as opposed to\nkeeping quiet. Or someone might be justified in favoring Kantian moral\ntheory over act-utilitarianism, because of counterexamples to\nact-utilitarianism, without being justified on that basis in favoring\nKantian moral theory over rule-utilitarianism, if that alternative is\nnot subject to the same counterexamples.\n\n\nMore generally, we can distinguish two contrast classes:\n\n\nThe extreme contrast class for a moral belief that\np includes every moral claim that is contrary to p,\nincluding moral nihilism.\n\n\nThe modest contrast class for a moral belief includes all and only those\ncontrary moral beliefs that most people would take seriously in an\nordinary discussion.\n\n\n\nSince moral nihilism conflicts with many commonsense moral beliefs, most people do not take moral nihilism seriously in ordinary discussions, so the modest contrast class does not include moral\nnihilism.  Thus, anyone who can rule out all other members of the\nmodest contrast class but cannot rule out moral nihilism is justified\nin believing the moral claim out of the modest contrast class but not\nout of the extreme contrast class.\n\n\nThese classes enable us to distinguish two versions of moral\nskepticism:\n\n\nSkepticism about modestly justified moral belief is the claim\nthat nobody is ever justified out of the modest contrast\nclass in holding any substantive moral belief.\n\nSkepticism about extremely justified moral belief is the\nclaim that nobody is ever justified out of the extreme contrast class\nin holding any substantive moral belief.\n\n\n\nThe latter but not the former follows if nobody can ever rule out\nmoral nihilism, but some believers sometimes can rule out all other\nmembers of the modest contrast class.\n\n\nCritics will ask, \u201cIf someone is justified out of the modest contrast\nclass but not out of the extreme contrast class, is this believer just\nplain justified (period or without qualification)?\u201d That, of course,\ndepends on what it means to say that a believer is justified (without\nqualification). On one plausible account, to say that a believer is\njustified (without qualification) is to say that the believer is\njustified out of the relevant contrast class. But which\ncontrast class is relevant when?\n\n\nContextualists say that the modest contrast class is relevant in\neveryday contexts, such as hospital ethics committees, where it would\nbe seen as a distraction to discuss moral nihilism. Nonetheless, the\nextreme contrast class is said to be relevant in philosophical\ncontexts, such as philosophy classes where moral nihilism is taken\nseriously. This allows contextualists to hold that a doctor in a\nhospital ethics committee is justified in believing a moral claim that\na philosophy student with the same evidence would not be justified in\nbelieving.\n\n\nProblems arise when contexts cross. Consider a philosophy student who\nsays that the doctor on the ethics committee is not justified in\nbelieving the moral claim. Is the student\u2019s contrast class (with moral\nnihilism) or the doctor\u2019s contrast class (without moral nihilism)\nreally relevant to the student\u2019s judgment about the doctor\u2019s belief?\nAnd what if the doctor says that the student really is justified while\nin the philosophy class? When epistemic assessments cross contexts in\nsuch ways, sometimes the believer\u2019s context seems relevant, but\nsometimes the assessor\u2019s context seems relevant, so it is hard to see\nany basis for claiming that either context or either contrast class\nreally is the relevant one for assessing whether the believer really\nis justified (without qualification).\n\n\nSuch paradoxes lead some \u2018classy\u2019 Pyrrhonian moral\nskeptics to deny that any contrast class is ever really relevant. This\ndenial implies that it is never either true or false that a believer\nis justified (without qualification), if such claims presuppose that\nsome contrast class is really relevant. Alternatively, classy\nPyrrhonian moral skeptics might suspend belief about whether any\ncontrast class is ever really relevant or not. Such Pyrrhonian moral\nskeptics refuse to take any position either way on whether any\nbeliever is justified (without qualification), although they can still\ntalk about whether someone is justified in believing a moral claim out\nof a specified contrast class. Pyrrhonian moral skeptics can then (i)\naccept skepticism about extremely justified moral belief but (ii) deny\nskepticism about modestly justified moral belief and (iii) refuse to\neither assert or deny (dogmatic) skepticism about any moral belief\nbeing justified (without qualification). (See Sinnott-Armstrong 2006,\nchap. 6.)\n\n\nWhether or not this view is finally defensible, the point here is just\nthat such a Pyrrhonian compromise is available and attractive to those\nwho want to avoid dogmatic moral skepticism but see no way to\nrefute it. There are also other possible compromises that combine\ndifferent strands in moral skepticism. That is what makes it so\nfascinating to study this important group of views.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ayer, A.
