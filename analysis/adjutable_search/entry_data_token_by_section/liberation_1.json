    "main_text": "History || The Long History\n1.1 The Long History\n\nThe philosophy of liberation, arguably, began in the late sixties when\nLeopoldo Zea and Augusto Salazar Bondy launched a debate with the\nquestion: \u201cIs there a Latin American philosophy?\u201d Whether\nthe answer was affirmative or negative did not affect the fact that\nthe movement would have to embark on the long path of the recovery of\nLatin American philosophy, at the very least in order to identify\nthose moments of originality and authentically autochthonous Latin\nAmerican thinking. It is for this reason that some philosophers\nliberation have argued that there are at least three antecedent\nhistorical stages that serve as the geological subsoil of liberation\nphilosophy. Following Dussel, they could be sketched as follows\n(Dussel 2005: 374\u20135):\n\nFirst Period. This is the period of the beginning of the\ncritique of the conquest and the development of a discourse that\nengages Amerindian thought. An important inaugural date is 1511 when\nAnt\u00f3n de Montesinos critiques the way evangelization is taking\nplace in the Americas. This is the period when a distinct continental\nawareness of the injustice that is being committed against the\nindigenous populations of the so-called New World emerges. The debate\nbetween Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda and Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de\nlas Casas at Valladolid in 1550 marks the clear emergence of a\nliberation discourse and consciousness. In this debate\nSep\u00falveda articulated a moment in the emergent imperial and\ncolonizing modern consciousness of Europe when he argued that\nAmerindians were naturally born slaves and that therefore they were to\nbe subjugated. Sep\u00falveda questioned the humanity of Amerindians\n(Dussel 2007, 2007a; Ruiz Sotelo 2010). In contrast, de las Casas\naffirmed the rational humanity of Amerindians, while acknowledging\ntheir distinctiveness. In fact, de las Casas affirms their rationality\nand treats appeals to their reason as a theological and evangelical\nnorm. The only true way for evangelization is the path of\nrational deliberation and not violent religious usurpation and\nimposition.\n\nSecond Period. This epoch is defined by the process of what\nmight be called the first emancipation, from 1750 until the end of the\nnineteenth century. Defining figures are Benito Diaz de Gamarra, who\npublished in 1774 his Elementa Recientioris Philosophiae,\nCarlos de Sing\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora, and Francisco Xavier\nClavigero, who articulated an anti-colonial and anti-absolutist\npolitical philosophy that launched a critique of the Spanish monarchy.\nSome of the notable figures of this epoch include Fray Servando Teresa\nde Mier (1763\u20131827), Manuel M. Moreno (in La Plata, what would\nbecome Argentina, 1778\u20131811), Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (in\nVenezuela, 1751\u20131854), Sim\u00f3n Bolivar (1783\u20131830),\nFrancisco de Miranda (1750\u20131816), Juan Germ\u00e1n Roscio\n(1763\u20131821). In the eighteenth century, these thinkers and many\nother \u201cpatriotras\u201d articulated a political\ndiscourse of emancipation from the Spanish crown. They called for\ncontinental independence, as well as the development of a distinct\n\u201cAmerican\u201d identity. Because of her blend of poetry,\ntheological speculation, praise of Amerindian traditions, and nascent\nfeminist awareness, Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1651\u20131695)\nshould\u00a0also be considered a contributor to this first discourse\nof emancipation and should be included among the figures that define\nthis epoch.\n\nThird Period.This epoch could characterized as a second\nmoment of emancipation, beginning at the end of the nineteen century\nand being bookended with the Cuban Revolution in 1959. Defining\nfigures are Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui (1894\u20131930),\nwhose book Siete ensayos sobre la realidad peruana (Seven\nInterpretative Essays on Peruvian Reality) (1968) gave expression to a\nnew emancipation agenda that is explicitly elaborated in terms of a\ndual approach that is attentive to the historical reality of the\nAmericas, with its indigenous and criollo backgrounds. It\nlaunched a critical appropriation of European ideas in the\n\u201cLatin American\u201d context. This epoch is defined by the\ncrises of both development efforts and populisms that were inattentive\nto the severe racial, ethnic, and class divisions within the Latin\nAmerican nations. It is against this context that Augusto Salazar\nBondy (1925\u20131974) and Leopoldo Zea (1912\u20132004) began to\ndebate the question whether there is a Latin American philosophy. This\nthird period is defined by the explicit consciousness of economic,\npolitical, social, and cultural dependence, under-development, and\ndomination (Vallega 2014). It is in this period that the need of a\ndiscourse of liberation begins to be explicitly articulated.\n",
