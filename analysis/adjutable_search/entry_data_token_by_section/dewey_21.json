    "main_text": "Philosophy of Education || Experiential Learning and Teaching\n5.1 Experiential Learning and Teaching\n\nDewey\u2019s \u201cReflex Arc\u201d paper applied functionalism to\neducation. \u201cReflex\u201d argued that human experience is not a\ndisjointed sequence of fits and starts, but a developing circuit of\nactivities. Learning deserves to be framed in this way: as a\ncumulative, progressive process where inquirers move from the\ndissatisfying phase of doubt toward another marked by the satisfying\nresolution of a problem. \u201cReflex\u201d also shows that the\nsubject of a stimulus (e.g., the pupil) is not a passive recipient of,\nsay, a sensation but an agent who takes it amidst other\nongoing activities in a larger environmental field.\n\nCognizance of such fundamental facts entailed, Dewey argued, that\neducators discard pedagogies based on the \u201cblank slate\u201d\nmodel of curriculum. Rather, in The School and Society, Dewey\nwrote, \u201cthe question of education is the question of taking hold\nof [children\u2019s] activities, of giving them direction\u201d\n(MW1: 25). Dewey\u2019s How We Think (1910c, MW6) was\nintended, primarily, to instruct teachers how to apply\ninstrumentalism; education\u2019s intellectual goals could be\nadvanced by acquainting children with the general intellectual habits\nof scientific inquiry. \n\n\nThe native and unspoiled attitude of childhood, marked by ardent\ncuriosity, fertile imagination, and love of experimental inquiry, is\nnear, very near, to the attitude of the scientific mind.\n(HWT, MW6: 179)\n\n\nGiven Dewey\u2019s different approach to psychology, teaching roles\nwould need revision. While teachers still had to know their subject\nmatter, they also needed to understand the student\u2019s cultural\nand personal backgrounds. Learning as an activity which incorporated\nactual problems necessitated a careful integration of lessons with\nspecific learners. Traditional motivational strategies, too, had to\nchange; rather than relying on rewards or punishments, Deweyan\nteachers were called to reimagine the whole learning environment; they\nmust merge the school\u2019s preexisting curricular goals with their\npupils\u2019 present interests. One way to do this was by identifying\nspecific problems able to bridge curriculum and student and then\ncreate situations in which students have to work them\n out.[31]\n The problem-centered approach demanded a lot from teachers, as it\nrequired training in subject matters, child psychology, and various\npedagogies capable of interweaving these\n together.[32]\n",
