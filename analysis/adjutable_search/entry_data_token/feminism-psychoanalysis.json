In doing so, it\ndiscloses the ways in which our sense of self, and our political\nloyalties and attachments, are influenced by unconscious drives and\nordered by symbolic structures that are beyond the purview of\nindividual agency. It might appear at the outset that any alliance\nbetween feminism and psychoanalysis would have to be coordinated on\ntreacherous ground: in Sigmund Freud\u2019s lecture on\n\u201cFemininity,\u201d for instance, while discussing the\n\u201criddle of femininity\u201d (Freud 1933 [1968: 116]) or of\nsexual differentiation, Freud\u2019s rhetoric impeaches women as\n\u201cthe problem\u201d (1933 [1968: 113]) and excuses members of\nhis audience from this indictment by offering the hope that they are\n\u201cmore masculine than feminine\u201d (1933 [1968: 117]). Many\nfeminists have outlined biases toward women contained in\nFreud\u2019s oratory and of the overt content of his claims. This\narticle will explain how and why feminist theory has, nonetheless,\nundertaken a serious reading of Freud and developed careful analyses\nof his fundamental concepts, working out their limits, impasses, and\npossibilities.\n\nIn \u201cFemininity,\u201d Freud writes that \u201cpsychoanalysis\ndoes not try to describe what a woman is\u2014that would be a task it\ncould scarcely perform\u2014but sets about enquiring how she comes\ninto being, how a woman develops out of a child with a bisexual\ndisposition\u201d (Freud 1933 [1968: 116]). In using the term\n\u2018bisexual,\u2019 Freud refers to a quality of the sexual\ninstinct, not a relation to a sexual object (which would be denoted by\nthe term \u2018inversion\u2019); the bisexual child is one who\npsychically is not yet either a man or a woman, whose instinctual life\nfunctions prior to sexual difference. Freud here portrays\nfemininity as one trajectory of the Oedipal Complex and indicates that\nsexed identity is a fragile achievement rather than a natural given or\nessence. By circumscribing the terrain on which the psychoanalytic\naccount of sexual difference moves, and by seeing unresolved, even\nunresolvable, riddles where others might see the work of nature or\nculture, Freud problematizes any causal, seamless, or direct tie\nbetween sex, sexuality, and sexual difference. Psychoanalytic inquiry\ndoes not fit comfortably with, and even unsettles, biological theories\nof sex and sociological theories of gender, thus also complicating the\nsex/gender distinction as it has often been formulated in feminist\ndebates. While sex and gender are sometimes construed in feminist\ntheory in terms of the contrast between biology and culture, or nature\nand nurture, Freud\u2019s theory, as discussed below, challenges\nthese dualisms, developing an account of the sexual drive that\ntraverses the mental and the physical, and undergoes idiosyncratic\nvicissitudes rather than assuming a uniform anatomical or social\nshape. Whatever the hazards of Freud\u2019s writings on women, then,\nhis work explores in new ways the meaning and possibilities of sexed\nidentity. Likewise, as I will argue below, psychoanalytic feminism\ninterrupts many assumptions about what feminism is and the conceptual\nand material objects it theorizes, including especially the very\nconcept of woman. In unsettling our understanding of this\nconcept, psychoanalysis also poses questions to feminism about the\nvalue of difference and the quest for equality, and the unresolved\ntensions between these divergent pursuits.\n\nWhile there is no doubt a vast ouvre of disparate positions\nthat might fall within the framework of psychoanalytic feminism, what\nis shared in common is a descent from, respect for, and some minimal\nborrowing of Freudian accounts of the unconscious, even while\ncriticizing and/or revising his theoretical apparatus. Any properly\npsychoanalytic theory must at the least offer an account of the\nunconscious and its relation to libido (the sex drive) and the death\ndrive. Precisely this descent, however, has also provided a\nbarrier to feminist deployment since Freud is sometimes read, at least\nsuperficially, as proffering misogynist, and perhaps Procrustean,\nelaborations of psychic structuration, curtailing and diminishing the\ndiversity of individual women\u2019s experiences into a restricted\nand unvarying formula that will fit within its own theoretical\nparameters. Nevertheless, Freud\u2019s reflections and hypotheses\nconcerning hysteria, the Oedipal Complex, female sexuality and\nfemininity, and women\u2019s role in civilization, among other ideas,\nhave provided the volatile grounds, the sites of contention, for\nfeminist re-articulation. Before any of the multiple and divergent\narticulations of psychoanalytic feminism can be discussed in more\ndetail, we must thus first establish their historical roots and the\nconceptual terrain on which they arise. Since a great deal of\npsychoanalytic feminist theory is specifically concerned with revising\nthe Oedipal narrative of Freud, this article will devote particular\nattention to Freud\u2019s theories of the unconscious as they pertain\nto the Oedipal Complex.\n", "toc": [{"#FreudFem": "1.

The Freudian Riddle of Femininity\n\nRooted in both clinical practice with patients and speculative\nattempts to apprehend and delineate foundational concepts,\nFreud\u2019s psychoanalysis aims to offer descriptions of psychical\nstructures that underlie and account for individual experience in the\nvariety of its empirical formations. Rather than the rationally\nself-interested individual presumed by liberal political theory or the\nself-contained and independent cogito presumed by Cartesian\nepistemology, Freud puts forward a divided subject, unknown to itself,\nan \u2018I\u2019 traversed by multiple\nagencies. According to Kristeva,\n\u201cFreud\u2019s discovery designated sexuality as the nexus\nbetween language and society, drives and the socio-symbolic\norder\u201d (Kristeva 1974 [1984: 84]). Freud\u2019s break-through\ninsight, in other words, is that sexual bonds initiate us into\nsubjectivity and civilization.\n\nFreud distinguishes human drives from instincts insofar as drives\n(unlike instincts) have no pre-given aim or object supplied by nature\nand follow no pre-set biological path.  For those who\ninhabit a human world, drives might come to be attached to any number\nof aims or objects, and felt through any number of bodily locales.\nDrives, according to Freud, become specified in these ways through the\nmediation of ideas or representations. Human embodiment is thus imbued\nwith opaque meaning, and sexuality emerges from a kind of instinctual\ninadequacy that presents desire as a difficulty or problem, and\npropels its increasing complexification.\n\nThe core of Freud\u2019s claim about the impact of sexuality on\npsychic processes can be discerned starting with Freud\u2019s early\nworks on hysteria, although a crucial transformation in his thinking\nmust be clarified. In Studies in Hysteria (1895),\nwritten in collaboration with Josef Breuer, Freud examines the\nphenomenon whereby a symptom might exist in the absence of an organic\nlesion. Hysteria is diagnosed when it is an idea or memory that makes\none ill, without any physical disease being the cause. By definition,\nhysteria is ideogenic (caused by an idea), as it designates the\nprocess by which a troubling but repressed idea is converted into a\nbodily symptom. Freud initially posits that hysterical symptoms arise\nas a result of violent childhood seduction (what today would be called\nmolestation), a real trauma that is then retroactively set in motion\nby a second, comparatively more mild, event, after a period of\nlatency. The \u2018seduction hypothesis\u2019 is an attempt to\nexplain the aetiology of hysteria (the origins of neurosis) by the\ntraumatic force of a premature sexual experience occurring in early\nchildhood, an external event that impinges upon the psychical\napparatus but whose memory is repressed, cut off from consciousness.\nThe repressed memory becomes somatized (enacted on the body and in\nbodily symptoms) when a later event, usually occurring in puberty,\ncatalyzes the earlier memory traces. The talking cure is developed as\na way to bring repressed memories forward and abreact or release them,\nre-binding the idea to its severed and dispersed affect (unrepressing\nit) and thereby dissolving the bodily symptom.\n\nIn the later Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905a),\nFreud contends, contrary to the earlier supposition that sexuality\nintervenes from the outside, that sexuality is a primordial and innate\n(if also inchoate) force of infantile life, arising from the bodily\nsensations that accompany the life processes. In the interim between\nthese two works, Freud had abandoned the seduction hypothesis and\nreplaced it with the thesis of infantile sexuality and the idea that\nsymptoms are brought about via the conflicts and repressions of\nunconscious fantasy. In other words, it is no longer repressed memory\nthat makes one ill and traumatic sexual violence no longer figures as\nthe primary cause of symptoms. Instead of an actual past experience,\nFreud posits fantasy as the determining factor of neurotic symptoms.\nTo understand the significance of this transition in his thinking, we\nmust grasp what Freud means by psychical reality and its distinction\nfrom material reality. In contrast to the historical, intersubjective\ndomain of material reality, psychical reality is the vital domain of\nfantasy and intra-psychic life, operating independently of objective\nconsiderations of veracity. In Freud\u2019s view, unconscious\nfantasies are not lies or deceptions, but reveal a truth, not about\nthe objective world, but about the internal life of the subject, who\none is and what one wants. It might be better to say that fantasies\nconceal this truth, since conscious articulations of desire and\nidentity will often lead us astray, expressing but distorting,\nmanifesting but denying, the subject\u2019s wishes.\n\nAs Freud documents in \u201cRemembering, Repeating, and\nWorking-Through\u201d (1914b), the conjectural move from memory to\ndesire and from fact to fantasy is also a move from external scenes of\nseduction to internal psychical acts, from past events to present-day\nforces, and from passive submission to active maintenance of discord.\nInstead of an external event impinging upon a child\u2019s\nundeveloped sexuality, the idea of infantile sexuality presupposes\nboth an energetic drive force at work from earliest childhood and an\ninternal or intrapsychic dissension, a subject at odds with its own\ndesires. The thesis of infantile sexuality universalizes the event of\ntrauma, locating its experience in the instinctual excitations that\noverwhelm the psychical apparatus which is prematurely affected. In\ndiscarding the seduction hypothesis, Freud not only discovers the\ndomain of fantasy and psychical reality, but he also paves the way for\nconsidering the energetics of the libido, the intrapsychic conflict\nthat is intrinsic to human being, and the idea of responsibility for\nthe dissonances of desire and the skirmishes that shape a life and its\npatterns. While controversy has swirled around Freud\u2019s rejection\nof the seduction hypothesis, without the scandalous supposition of\ninfantile sexuality there would be no psychoanalytic theory of the\nunconscious. Although some revisionists have argued that Freud\nabandons his principles and betrays his patients, in fact Freud never\nabjures the reality of sexual abuse or denies that some children are\nmolested. Rather, the transformation in his thinking concerns the\naetiology of hysteria in a diagnostic sense; neuroses are no longer\nsaid to originate in (presumably rare) childhood sexual violence, and\nthus they can be seen to pervade rather than oppose whatever might be\nconsidered normal sexual development. In discarding the idea of a\nprimary or ontological innocence of the psyche which is then violently\nimposed upon from the outside, Freud arrives at the fundamental\npremise of psychoanalytic thought.\n\nThe exemplar of this phantasmatic activity of the unconscious is the\nOedipal Complex. In Freud\u2019s later writings on femininity,\nincluding \u201cFemininity\u201d (1933), \u201cFemale\nSexuality\u201d (1931), and \u201cSome Psychical Consequences of the\nAnatomical Distinction between the Sexes\u201d (1925), Freud\npostulates that the little girl\u2019s Oedipal Complex runs a\ndifferent course than the little boy\u2019s and holds a different\nrelation to castration anxiety. Crucially, Freud maintains that\nfemininity cannot be grasped from a biological or conventional\nperspective (Freud 1933 [1968: 114]). Another way of putting this is\nthat sexual difference is centrally concerned with psychical reality\nrather than material reality, with the realm of fantasy rather than\nnature or culture. The Oedipal story is the story of psychic\ndevelopment, the story of how we become subjects and in becoming\nsubjects, how we become sexually differentiated.\n\nThe boy and the girl start off, pre-Oedipally, in the same emotional\nplace, attached to the mother, and it is because of this shared\nstarting point that Freud claims the little girl is a little man; they\nare not yet distinct or sexually differentiated. It is for this reason\nas well that Freud maintains the idea of a single, masculine, libido:\nthe libido is not neutral in Freud\u2019s view since its original\nobject is the mother and this desire for the mother is associated by\nFreud with masculinity and activity, just as he associates infant\nclitoral pleasure with phallic enjoyment. Still Freud acknowledges\nthat in the libido\u2019s most primordial stages, there can be no\nsexual distinction. It is not until children pass through the Oedipal\nComplex that they can properly be said to have a genital organization\nsince this is acquired through a relation to castration and is the\nlast stage in sexual development (following oral, anal, and phallic\nstages). Hence both children at infancy are \u2018little men,\u2019\ntheir desire construed through the terms of a single masculine\nlibido. \n\nFreud seems genuinely puzzled by how femininity comes\nabout given the girl\u2019s prehistory of love\nand attachment to the mother, why would she switch allegiances to the\nfather? And since, prior to genital organization, she too goes through\na phallic (masturbatory) stage, why would she switch the site of\nbodily pleasure from the clitoris to the vagina? These are among the\nmysteries he means to designate when referring to the riddle of\nfemininity. That he understands it to be a riddle also intimates that\nhe understands sexual identity not as a natural pre-given essence,\nrooted in anatomy, but rather as a form of individuation and\ndifferentiation realized through complex interaction between the\nbodily drives and familial others. The boy\u2019s story is more\nseamless and continuous since he retains his phallic pleasure and,\nalthough he must displace the immediate object of his desire (no\nlonger the mother, but someone like her), can look forward to\nsubstitute objects. The boy\u2019s Oedipal attachment to the mother\nfollows uninterruptedly from a pre-Oedipal attachment and it is\nbrought to an end by the threat of castration emanating from the\nfather. At the conclusion of the Oedipal Complex the boy identifies\nwith the father, establishes a super-ego within, and abandons the\nimmediate object of desire with the promise that he too will one day\npossess a similar object modeled on the mother. But the girl\u2019s\nOedipal Complex is necessarily more complicated since it can only be\ninstigated by a break from the pre-Oedipal relation to the mother and\nis therefore a secondary formation. Freud postulates that it is the\nrealization that the beloved mother is castrated that prompts the\nlittle girl to turn her love toward her father. For the girl, in other\nwords, castration does not resolve the Oedipal Complex but leads her\nto enter it, and for this reason Freud claims that it is never wholly\nbrought to a conclusion or demolished, thus accounting, in his view,\nfor girls\u2019 weaker super-egos and lesser capacity for\nsublimation. The girl turns from her mother not in fear but in\ncontempt and because of envy for what the mother does not possess. The\nfather represents for her neither a threat (she finds herself already\ncastrated) nor the prospect of a fulfilled desire in the future (the\nonly replacement for the missing penis is a child of her own), as he\ndoes for the boy who can identify with him and hope to eventually have\nwhat he has. The father\u2019s only promise is thus as a refuge from\nloss, represented by the mother who bears this loss and who is at\nfault for the girl\u2019s own. In the girl\u2019s Oedipal scenario,\nthe father, unlike the castrated mother, stands for the virile\ncapacity of desire itself, which she herself lacks but might reclaim\nthrough another man\u2019s provision of the opportunity to have a\nchild. In the trajectory of the girl\u2019s Oedipal Complex,\nfemininity is realized as the desire to be the object of masculine\ndesire.\n\nFreud\u2019s theories of sexuality and the unconscious implicate not\nonly individual psychology but also the constitution of social life.\nFormed in ambivalent relation to others, sexuality and sexual identity\npermeate the bonds of civilization and ramify throughout all social\nrelations. In turning his attention to broader cultural questions,\nFreud offers a story or myth of the origin of political structures\nthat parallels and echoes his understanding of the individual psyche.\nTo understand the political import of the Oedipal Complex, it will be\nhelpful to place it more generally within the scope of Freud\u2019s\nunderstanding of group psychology. In Group Psychology and the\nAnalysis of the Ego (1921), Freud contests\nany clear-cut opposition between group and individual psychology and\nalleges that human infancy is from the beginning immersed in a world\nof others. Even in ostensibly individual psychology, there is always\nanother involved, as model or object, as site of identification or as\nobject of love. Identification and love, which form the core of\nidentity, are already \u201csocial phenomena\u201d and, inversely\nsocial relations are themselves premised on developments that occur in\nthe family. It is thus mistaken to sever individual from group\npsychology as though they were not by nature intermingled or to\nsuppose that there is some kind of special social instinct separate\nfrom the drives that energize the individual. Put another way, the\nindividual subject is neither formed wholly independently in a kind of\nsolitary interiority nor formed as merely an effect of exterior social\nforces.\n\nTotem and Taboo (1913) is Freud\u2019s attempt to\nexplain the origin of social life, the bonds that, on his account,\nhold men together, on the basis of psychic phenomena. Freud\nenvisages a primitive pre-political sociality in which a primal horde\nof brothers is oppressed by a powerful father who claims for himself\nall the women, all the enjoyment, available in the community. The\nbrothers are deprived or exiled, and they are motivated to bond\ntogether to overthrow the father; they aim, that is, to kill the\nfather and take for themselves his women, offenses that mirror, at a\ncollective level, the Oedipal desires of male children. In\nFreud\u2019s story, the father\u2019s murder results not in lawless\nfreedom and unlimited access to sexual objects (a fraternal civil\nwar), but rather in the creation of totems and taboos\u2014the primal\nfather becomes a totemic figure, a revered ancestral object, and the\nbrother\u2019s actions in killing him and claiming his women are\nreconceived as the prohibited transgressions of murder and incest. The\ntwo blood taboos that are instituted as law, the prohibitions on\nincest and murder, thus have a common origin and emerge\nsimultaneously, and together they mandate the social processes of\nexogamy (marriage outside one\u2019s own kin) and totemism (communal\nbonds of affiliation established through the medium of a common\nancestor). Freud thereby allies political formation with the two\nprimal wishes of children and the two crimes of Oedipus, predicating\nexogamy on the incest taboo, and fraternal bonds on the sacralization\nof life and the prohibition on murder. Totemism and exogamy also\nentail fraternal equality: in order that no one take the place of the\nfather and assume his singular power, the brothers are equally\nconstrained and equally respected, the distribution of women equally\nallotted. Depicting the creation of a stable society grounded in law\n(though founded in violence), Freud\u2019s tale serves as a paradigm\nfor not only rudimentary, but also enduring and contemporary,\npolitical relations, which he views as rooted in unconscious drives\nbut oriented toward achieving a stabilization or equilibrium of those\ndrives at the communal level. In Freud\u2019s narrative, it is the\nfather/son relationship that matters for the establishment of this\nsemi-stable political relation, a band of brothers with equal rights.\nThis lineage founds political order in murderous fraternity, with\nwomen as objects of exchange not citizen-subjects.\n\nMoreover, in explaining the advent of lawful existence, Freud\nidentifies something recalcitrant, intractable in social\narrangements\u2014a kind of self-assault (the super-ego) that links\npleasure with aggression, and thus that carries a potentially\ndestabilizing force. The sons\u2019 attitude toward the father is one\nof ambivalence, hatred qualified by admiration, murder followed by\nguilt and remorse. The brothers commemorate this loss and maintain\ntheir bond with one another in the public ceremony of the totem meal\nwhere together they consume a common substance (the father\u2019s\nbody transubstantiated into the sacrificed totem), and thereby affirm\ntheir fellowship and mutual obligation. This confirmation of shared\npaternal substance and kinship, and the collective affect of love,\nloss, guilt, and mourning, maintains ties of identity. The law that\nemerges from the father\u2019s murder ritualizes and enforces his\nedicts, forbidding murder and incest in the public realm, and takes\nhold internally in the superegoic \u2019no\u2019 of prohibition,\nproducing a permanent sense of guilt that drives civilization and\nrenders it a perpetual source of discontent. Women, however, appear\nnot as subjects of the law but as objects of its exchange; moreover,\ngiven the indefinite prolongation of their Oedipal Complex, women will\nbe more likely to be hostile to the edicts of civilization insofar as\nthese infringe upon family life.\n\nThe relation between father and son is also contained, if concealed,\nin the account Freud offers in The Ego and the Id (1923) of\nhow the ego emerges. There Freud writes that identification is\n\u201cthe earliest expression of an emotional tie with another\nperson\u201d (Freud 1923 [1968: 37]), i.e., it is prior to\nobject-cathexes or relations of desire. The primordial libidinal, but\nnon-objectal, attachment is with the father of \u201cpersonal\nprehistory\u201d (Freud 1923 [1968: 37]). The subsequent and\nrecurring retreat from object-cathexis (investment of instinctual\nenergy in an object) to identification (withdrawal of that energy into\nthe self), is the primary mechanism of ego-formation, taking the lost\nobject into oneself. Since the ego is the \u201cprecipitate\u201d of\nabandoned objects, it is configured through loss, in a melancholy\nreabsorption that incorporates via identification objects from which\nthe ego would otherwise be exiled. Just as the father retains\ndominance in political life after his death, so he dominates psychic\nlife even prior to the ego\u2019s formation. In Freudian theory, the\nfather\u2019s reign is pervasive, his sovereignty extended in every\ndomain. Freud\u2019s privileging of paternal and fraternal\nrelations provides the impetus for much of psychoanalytic\nfeminism, as will be discussed below.\n2. Feminist Criticism of Psychoanalysis\n\nEven in Freud\u2019s circle, not all analysts agreed with\nFreud\u2019s assessment and there were debates concerning\nwomen\u2019s sexuality and the roles of castration and penis envy\ntherein, notably among Karl Abraham, Ernest Jones, Helene Deutsch, and\nKaren Horney. Horney in particular argued for an inherent feminine\ndisposition that is not merely a secondary formation premised on\ncastration and she took issue with the ostensible effects of penis\nenvy and women\u2019s supposed feelings of inferiority. As with some\nlater feminist criticisms of Freud, Horney attempted to retrieve\nfemale sexuality, and by extension a valid form of feminine existence,\nby appealing to a genuinely independent nature and holding culture\nculpable for women\u2019s subordinate status. By thus reasserting the\nprimacy of biological and social forces, however, Horney disputes\nprecisely the idea that is central to Freud\u2019s hypothesis and\nthat marks psychoanalysis as a unique field of inquiry, that of a\ndistinctive psychical realm of representation that is unconscious.\n\nSomewhat later, Simone de Beauvoir addressed the discourse of\npsychoanalysis in\nThe Second Sex (1949), devoting an early chapter to her\ndistrust of \u201cThe Psychoanalytic Point of View\u201d (Beauvoir\n1949 [1989: 38\u201352]). Like Horney, Beauvoir denounces\nFreud\u2019s idea that there is but one, masculine, libido and no\nfeminine libido with \u201cits own original nature\u201d (1949\n[1989: 39]). Freud, in her view, takes for granted what he needs to\naccount for, namely the value placed on virility. Beauvoir takes Freud\nto task for not considering the social origins of masculine and\npaternal power and privilege and deems his theory inadequate to\naccount for woman\u2019s otherness. If women envy men, she argues, it\nis because of the social power and privilege they enjoy, and not\nbecause of anatomical superiority. Unlike the determinisms and\nobjectifications of human life offered by biological science (which\ntreats human beings as determinate objects in the natural world and\nthus not as free or self-determining subjects with agency), but\nsimilar to the \u201ceconomic monism\u201d of historical materialism\n(1949 [1989: 52]), psychoanalysis is characterized by Beauvoir as\n\u201csexual monism\u201d (1949 [1989: 52]): everything in its\npurview is interpreted through a single lens. Beauvoir indicates at\nthe opening of the chapter that psychoanalysis offers a perspective\nwhich she does \u201cnot intend to criticize as a whole\u201d (1949\n[1989: 38]), especially since it does understand that \u201cno factor\nbecomes involved in the psychic life without having taken on human\nsignificance\u201d (1949 [1989: 38]), but she questions both its\ndogmatic reliance on determinate elements of development and\nits \u201cembarrassing flexibility on a basis of rigid\nconcepts\u201d (1949 [1989: 38]). Most seriously, in Beauvoir\u2019s\nview, psychoanalysis allots to women the same destiny of self-division\nand conflict between subjectivity and femininity that follows from\nsocial dictates and biological norms. Psychoanalysis presents the\ncharacteristics of femininity and subjectivity as divergent paths,\nincompatible with one another. Women might be able to be full persons,\nsubjects with agency, but only at the expense of their femininity; or\nthey can embark on the course of femininity, but only by sacrificing\ntheir independence and agency. This either/or between the\nmasculinization of subjectivity and the submission to femininity\nretains the moral, political, and metaphysical opposition between free\nself-creation and corporeal incarceration that precludes the\npossibility of being both a woman and a subject.\n\nBeauvoir alleges that psychoanalysis holds women to a fixed destiny, a\ndevelopmental and teleological life process, precisely insofar as it\ndefines subjects with reference to a past beyond their control. By\nassigning to women an essence or determinate identity, the\npsychoanalytic reliance on sexual categories once again renders woman\nas the other to a subject rather than a subject herself, and\nthereby denies her existential freedom. In Beauvoir\u2019s view,\nhowever, if women are not themselves subjects, but that in contrast\nwith which men\u2019s subjectivities are constituted, they are still\nfreely responsible for this situation, insofar as women collaborate in\nthis process by seeing themselves through the eyes of men, justifying\ntheir existence through their romantic relationships, and attempting\nto mirror men\u2019s being. By casting women\u2019s otherness as an\neffect not only of their social situation (with its power relations),\nbut also of their choices (and hence responsibility), Beauvoir\npreserves women\u2019s freedom, unlike the psychoanalytic discourse\nthat she claims rejects \u201cthe idea of choice and the correlated\nconcept of value\u201d (Beauvoir 1949 [1989: 45]).\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s misgivings about Freud\u2019s account of femininity\nstem from two sources, a feminist suspicion that women, in\npsychoanalytic discourse, are understood on the basis of a masculine\nmodel, and an existentialist conviction that human beings are\nself-defining, choosing themselves through their own actions.\nFollowing her existentialist convictions, Beauvoir insists that even\nwhen women abdicate their freedom, they do so as agents responsible\nfor their own destinies, not merely as passive victims following a\ndevelopmentally determined fate. Following her feminist convictions,\nBeauvoir recognizes that women\u2019s choices may be constrained by\npowerful social and bodily forces, but insists that women nonetheless\nbear ultimate responsibility for realizing their own possibilities by\nemancipating themselves. Her reading of Freud is thus largely directed\nagainst the perceived determinism of psychoanalysis and less against\nthe idea of an unconscious per se, although she does want to defend\nthe notion of a unitary subject at the origin of choice, insisting\nthat \u201cpsychic life is not a mosaic, it is a single whole in\nevery one of its aspects and we must respect that unity\u201d\n(Beauvoir 1949 [1989: 44]), a supposition that certainly limits the\naffinities between existentialism and psychoanalysis. Nonetheless,\nBeauvoir\u2019s dispute with Freud appears to be less about whether\nconstraint is part of our being in the world, and more about where\nthat constraint is located: psychoanalysis locates constraint\ninternally, in the constitution of the psyche itself, not only in the\nsituations of social life, whereas Beauvoir locates it externally, in\nthe cultural forces that impact even the most intimate sense of our\nown agency. Beauvoir thus claims that her own interpretations of\nwomen\u2019s femininity will disclose women in their liberty,\noriented freely by the future and not simply explained by a past. She\nthereby ratifies the promise of existentialism for feminism.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s own project of elucidating the paradoxical relation\nbetween femininity and subjectivity is nonetheless influenced by\npsychoanalytic concepts and appropriates its theoretical insights in\nvarious ways. The Second Sex highlights the practices by\nwhich women become women through their appropriation of bodily\n(sexual) difference, as well as the manner in which a human being\ngenerally is limited and compelled by bodily and unconscious forces.\nIndeed Beauvoir and Freud seem to agree that one is not born but\nbecomes a woman, i.e., that femininity involves some sort of (social\nor psychical) process rather than a biological or natural given. Both\nare interested in the \u2018how\u2019 of this process, how one\nbecomes a woman, although, as discussed above, they disagree about\nwhat this \u2018how\u2019 is. Moreover, in her articulation of\nwomen\u2019s ambivalent attitudes toward embodiment, sexuality, and\nmaternity, Beauvoir is clearly indebted to the attention\npsychoanalytic practice gives to listening to women\u2019s first\nperson narratives, interpreting the emotional impact of events that\ncan not be easily categorized, and heeding attachments that carry both\naffection and resentment. Like Freud, Beauvoir recognizes that we are\nembodied as sexual beings and that our bodies not only testify to our\nown finitude and limits but also matter as sites of encounters with\nothers, encounters that are multivalent\u2014including loving\nconnections and threatening defenses, moments of affirmation and of\ndissolution. Beauvoir refuses any political program that demands we\ndeny our bodily possibilities in order to be fully human and proclaims\nthat bodies and bodily difference are integral to projects of\nselfhood, and not merely accidental contingencies of a rational and\ndisembodied mind. For Beauvoir, as for Freud, there is no such thing\nas a disembodied, non-sexed human being; any ideal of the human apart\nfrom sexual identity or difference is an abstraction that can only be\naffirmed on the basis of a mind/body dualism. Femininity for her is\nnot merely a mystification that imprisons women\u2019s subjectivity\n(even if its social construal has had this effect). Finally, like\nFreud, Beauvoir is fully aware of the impact on children of their\ndomestic situation, the way familial life resonates with meaning that\ninforms not only intimate relations but relations to the larger\nworld.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s portrayal of living a feminine existence, of sexual\ndifference as an embodied situation, developed through a series of\nphenomenological descriptions, tries to understand how women have been\ncast as other in the drama of masculine subjectivity and doubts the\npremise that this is an historical event, occurring at some definitive\npoint in time. Beauvoir herself has often been (mis)read in a way\nanalogous to her (mis)reading of psychoanalysis, as proferring a\ndeterminate succession of experiences for women, rather than\ndescribing socially extant processes. But The Second Sex\ndepicts the effects on women\u2019s character of inequitable social\narrangements; it neither proffers a normalized destiny for women nor\npresupposes a common metaphysical identity. Even so, in many ways\nBeauvoir\u2019s work is more easily aligned with the sociologically\noriented Anglo-American feminists than with Irigaray and Kristeva.\n3. Language, Law, and Sexual Difference \n\nIn considering the background of psychoanalytic feminism, a large\nportion of which is rooted in or aligned with what gets called French\nFeminism, the French context of psychoanalytic theory is also crucial,\nand in particular the work of Jacques Lacan. Lacan\u2019s work has\nbeen both a powerful influence on, and an object of critique for,\nfeminist appropriations of psychoanalysis, and his ideas have been\ntaken up, transformed, and challenged by Luce Irigaray and Julia\nKristeva (both of whom are discussed below), among others.\nLacan\u2019s work is both praised for its de-biologization of Freud\nand pilloried for its phallocentrism. These two aspects are in fact\nimbricated, as both hinge on Lacan\u2019s elaboration of language as\na symbolic order that precedes and makes possible human subjectivity.\nIn order to stay focused on the feminist deployment of the\npsychoanalytic theoretical apparatus, I will concentrate first on\nLacan\u2019s understanding of the intersection of language and law in\nthe symbolic order, and then on his account of the ego\u2019s\nformation in the imaginary order. The imaginary and symbolic are modes\nof representation that make the world and the self intelligible. The\nsymbolic is Lacan\u2019s term for the way in which reality becomes\nintelligible and takes on meaning and significance, through words; the\nimaginary refers to the mode of intelligibility offered by images. The\nconcordant and conflicting mediation of the world by images and words\ncoordinates, or makes sense of, reality and instigates both\nsubjectivity and social relations. As with Freud, maternal and\npaternal figures are central to his account of subjectivity. \n\nLacan characterizes his own work as fundamentally a return to Freud,\nalbeit one that brings the insights of structural linguistics,\nespecially Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jakobson, and structural\nanthropology, primarily Claude Levi-Strauss, into the domain of\npsychoanalysis. Even so, his returns are also revisions; he not only\nretrieves but renovates Freud\u2019s central concepts.\nAccording to Lacan, Freud\u2019s theory of sexuality anticipates a\ntheory of signification that he could not yet elaborate. The\nanthropological and linguistic lineage of Lacan\u2019s thought is\ncentral to this conceptualization of a \u201csymbolic universe\ndomain.\u201d Lacan explicitly endorses Levi-Strauss\u2019s\nconception of the transcendental law at the origin of human sociality\nas the incest taboo; he writes that \u201cthe fundamental or primary\nlaw, the one where culture begins in opposition to nature, is the law\nof the prohibition of incest\u201d (Lacan 1986 [1992: 66\u20137]).\nThe intrusion of language and law institutes a break with nature, one\nthat transfigures the world by imbuing it with meaning. Following the\nlogic of Totem and Taboo, social identities are constituted\non the basis of exclusions that establish kinship networks. These\nsocial bonds are maintained through mandates and prohibitions (what is\nrequired and what is forbidden), and in particular through the mandate\nof exogamy (with its structures of exchange) which determines that\n\u201cthe Oedipus complex is both universal and contingent\u201d\n(Lacan 1978 [1991b: 33]): paternal prohibition provides the conditions\nfor human sociality without the prohibition itself being innate. Lacan\nthus accounts for the transgenerational transmission of elementary\nstructures of kinship without appealing to any natural necessity.\nLacan takes this law of kinship (dictating desire and its limits) to\nbe fundamentally co-terminous with the order of language since it is\ninstituted through a symbolic articulation.\n\nLacan calls the paternal prohibition (the incest taboo) the \u2018law\nof the father,\u2019 and he develops the connection between law and\nlanguage by way of a pun. In French Non (No) and Nom\n(Name) sound alike. The no that prohibits (the father\u2019s law) and\nthe name that establishes authority (the father\u2019s name or the\nproper name) are conferred simultaneously. By submitting to the law of\nthe father (his no and name) the child assumes a symbolic identity and\nplace in the human universe of meaning, i.e., the child becomes a\nsubject, bound by law and bearer of language. With this compliance,\nthe child takes on a life of desire and incompletion, pursuing lost\nobjects with no firm ground or fixed purpose, a lack of plenitude in\nbeing that Lacan designates as castration. \n\nAs discussed above in the section on Freud, Freud understands women to\nbe \u2018castrated,\u2019 deprived of a penis, and men to live under\nthe threat of castration. Lacan complicates this theoretical\nperspective by deeming all subjects, all speaking beings, to be\ncastrated, by which he means deprived of the phallus, which is not the\nsame as the penis. While the penis is a biological organ, the phallus\nis a signifier which invokes or points toward other signifiers, or\ntoward a system of signifiers.  The moment of\ncastration is the primordial moment of loss, the fracturing of being\nby language. With entry into the reign of law and language, subjects\nare cut off from the immediacy of bodily experience; relations to\nthings, and to oneself and others, are now mediated by words and\nrepresentations. \n\nCastration takes place when the child recognizes lack in the mother\nand her maternal omnipotence is annulled. The mother, for the child,\nceases to be the all-powerful provider of every satisfaction as she\nherself is a desiring being deprived of satisfaction. This conundrum\nof maternal desire points elsewhere, toward \u201cthe law introduced\nby the father\u201d (Lacan 1966 [2006: 582]). The paternal\nprohibition intervenes to warn the child that s/he is not the answer\nto the question of the mother\u2019s desire. Galvanized by the\nmother\u2019s lack, the law of the father (which need not be embodied\nin an actual person) takes the place of the desire of the mother,\nsubstitutes for it, occludes it. Indeed the paternal function, working\nthrough name and law, indicates a dead father, just as Freud\nunderstands in Totem and Taboo that the murdered father, the\nprecondition of law, is stronger than the living one. In the Lacanian\nversion of the Oedipal Complex, human beings achieve a sexual position\nby traversing the Oedipal Complex, i.e., by submitting to castration,\nalso called the phallic function, and thereby entering into\nsignification. There is thus no sexual difference prior to\nrepresentation.\n\nHere we arrive at the phallocentrism, if not the patriarchalism, of\nLacan\u2019s thought, the central role of the phallus in his thinking\nabout subjectivity and sexual difference. According to Lacan, the\nphallus instates the signifier into the subject regardless of any\n\u201canatomical distinction between the sexes\u201d (Lacan 1966\n[2006: 576]). The phallus, in other words, is responsible for the\nchild\u2019s passage from immersion in perceptual immediacy to a\nrepresentational domain in which the world takes on meaning. It is\nthis claim that de-biologizes Freud, since it articulates the function\nof the phallus apart from any particular bodily attributes. Lacan\ninsists that the phallus is a signifier, not an image or bodily organ,\nand that in relation to it all are castrated. The father\u2019s No\neffectively says to the child \u2018you are not the object of the\nmother\u2019s desire\u2019 or \u2018you are not her phallus, the\nthing that fulfills her.\u2019 As such, it also conveys the message\nthat the child too is lacking or desiring. Although Lacan\ndistinguishes between a \u2018seeming to be\u2019 which\ncharacterizes femininity, in the attempt to be the phallus that one is\nnot (to be the object of desire), from a \u2018seeming to have\u2019\nwhich characterizes masculinity in the attempt to have the phallus\nthat one does not have (to possess the object of desire), he still\nmaintains that everyone is lacking the phallus in some way, either in\nthe mode of not being it or in the mode of not having it. Nonetheless,\nwhile Lacan centers human experience not on the supposed biological\nfixity of anatomical distinctions, but on a representational economy,\nthe phallus retains its associations with masculinity and remains the\nfocal point of sexual identity. \n\nAs already discussed, Freud had theorized that there is only one\nlibido and it is masculine. In \u201cThe Signification of the\nPhallus,\u201d Lacan explicitly addresses, and criticizes, the\nalternative view that there might be two libidos, which he satirizes\nas a kind of sexual equality, the \u201cequality of natural\nrights\u201d (Lacan 1966 [2006: 577]). This is the view I earlier\nmentioned as belonging to Karen Horney who defends the idea of an\ninherent, underived, biologically-based, nature of feminine sexuality.\nLacan also disparages the idea that the final stage of genital\nsexuality is directed toward the entire person in his or her\npersonhood, the achievement of a kind of tenderness toward the whole\nbeing of another (Lacan 1966 [2006: 580]). Lacan disputes both of\nthese positions as normalizing and biologizing and claims that the\npsyche is not harmonized with nature in either of these ways. In\ncontrast to this fantasy of sexual complementarity, the idea that\nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s sexual interests converge, Freud, Lacan\nclaims, understood \u201cthe essential disturbance of human\nsexuality\u201d (1966 [2006: 575]), that we are always lacking,\nalways in search of aims and objects, \u201cthe deviation of\nman\u2019s needs due to the fact that he speaks\u201d (1966 [2006:\n579]), and that this discordance means also that there is no\nsymmetrical or harmonious sexual relation between well-integrated and\nself-realized men and women.\n\nThis symbolic dimension of human relations must be clearly\ndistinguished from the imaginary as the domain of the ego. The\nimaginary order is most fundamentally and plainly elucidated in\nLacan\u2019s essay \u201cThe Mirror Stage as Formative of the\nI Function as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience,\u201d\nwhere he elaborates Freud\u2019s insights in The Ego and the\nId, taking up the idea that the ego is first and foremost a\nbodily ego formed through the \u201cprojection of a surface\u201d\n(Freud 1923 [1968: 27]), a visual representation of an external veneer\nor fa\u00e7ade. Lacan concurs, writing that consciousness occurs\n\u201ceach time \u2026 there\u2019s a surface such that it can\nproduce what is called an image\u201d (Lacan 1978 [1991b:\n49]). The mirror stage commences, pre-Oedipally, when the infant is\naround 6 months old. The infant at this age is literally\ninfans, without speech and moreover, without bodily\ncoordination or motor control. Born prematurely, at a point prior to\nany adequate capacity for self-care, the infant is wholly\ninstinctually inept. By identifying itself with an image, a coherent\nunity that contrasts to its own fragmented and dispersed bodily\nexistence, the infant forms a preliminary self, one animated by an\nillusion but an illusion that allows it to anticipate its own future\norganization.\n\nLacan\u2019s account of the mirror stage establishes the ego as\nfundamentally imaginary, formed through the infant\u2019s specular\ncaptivation with the unitary form presented in images of itself which\nit assumes as its own through identification. This perceptual image of\ncoherent bodily contours and boundaries is at odds with the\ninfant\u2019s motor incapacity and the \u201cturbulent\nmovements\u201d or fragmented drives that animate its own body and\nprocesses. The ego, with its illusion of self-mastery and containment,\nis formed through misrecognition, an anticipatory identification with\nan idealized, stable, self-enclosed, citadel of self. This\nidentification with an image of oneself sets up the ego as rivalrous,\nnarcissistic, and aggressive. While the act of misrecognition becomes\nthe basis for a sense of self or for self-consciousness, it is also an\nact of alienation, exclusion, or self-division; by erecting an\nimaginary ideal, representing oneself in a perfected image, the self\nis also split and rendered unconscious to itself, cut off from the\nmultiplicity of dispersed drives. \n\nFor Lacan, the ego is a \u201cknot of imaginary servitude\u201d\n(Lacan 1966 [2006: 80]) and thus the site of the subject\u2019s\nstagnancy and inertia. The mirror stage also forms the basis of\nLacan\u2019s critique of ego psychology; whereas the latter takes\nstrengthening the ego to be the aim of analytic practice, Lacan takes\nthe aspirations of the ego to be a \u201clure\u201d (1966 [2006:\n78]) of self-possession, an armor that rigidifies the subject and\nresists freedom and movement, a defensive structure that provides an\nalienating identity. With this theory of the ego, Lacan presents a\nsubject at odds with itself, non-self-identical, in \u201cprimordial\nDiscord\u201d (1966 [2006: 78]), torn between unity and anarchy,\norganization and chaos, integration and fragmentation. The withdrawal\nof the self from itself proceeds from the reflexivity of\nrepresentational practices of language. The ego as object is trapped\nin oppositional relationships, including with itself, and cannot\ntherefore be equated with the subject as speaking being who, in the\nuse of words, signifiers that are differentially related to one\nanother, is capable of more complex plays of presence and absence;\nlanguage, unlike perception (I perceive an object or I don\u2019t),\ncan evoke simultaneously the presence and the absence of the thing (I\ncan represent objects that are not present).\n\nWhile the advent of the symbolic order is tied to Oedipalization, and\nthe imaginary order is tied to the pre-Oedipal period, it would be\nmistaken to think of the imaginary and symbolic in only developmental\nor chronological terms as they are also ongoing structures of\nexperience. Even in the seemingly dyadic relation between mother and\nchild, Lacan argues, a third term is always at work. Initially this\nthird term is simply a question, the question of the mother\u2019s\ndesire, of what she wants, but already this question interrupts or\ndestabilizes the child\u2019s position, rents dyadic unity, even as\nthe child takes itself to be this object of desire, since it indicates\nin a preliminary way that the mother is lacking, that she is not\nwhole, entire, omnipotent. The question of desire, in other words,\nmeans that the phallic mother of the imaginary is already the\ncastrated mother of the symbolic, and that the imaginary unity of the\nego, with its oppositional relations, is bound to be sublated into a\nsymbolic relation of difference.\n\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the mother with the woman or\nmaternity with femininity. Lacan famously declares that\n\u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as Woman, Woman with a capital\nW indicating the universal\u201d (1975 [1998: 72]), a\nmetaphysical concept with determinate and substantive content. In\nasserting that \u2018The Woman\u2019 does not exist, Lacan indicates\nthat something of the psyche escapes castration, limitation,\nsignification, and the demands of the law of the father. Symbolic and\nimaginary representations leave something out, hit their limit,\nproduce an impasse that presents a fracture or fissure in the symbolic\norder. While sexual difference is mediated by representation, it\ncannot be fully contained within its terms.\n\n\nThe idea that sexual difference is not biologically innate but\nestablished through language and law has led some feminists to conclude\nthat Lacan is on the side of social constructionism but this would be\nmistaken. Lacan is adamant that the choice between nature and\nculture is a false one, and that language is not a \u201csocial\nphenomenon\u201d (Lacan 2006 [1970], 578). Language and law,\npersonified by the name of the father, are irreducible to social\npractices and processes and are in fact the condition of their\npossibility. While Lacan is criticized for constituting sexual\ndifference on the basis of the phallic function and subjectivity on the\nbasis of paternal authority, what the Lacanian project does provide for\nfeminism is not the idea of a malleable culture, susceptible to human\nmastery, as distinct from a fixed nature that escapes it, but the more\ndisconcerting idea that human mastery, of ourselves, of others, of\nnature and culture, is itself illusory. Rather than the promise\nof a rational progress toward greater and greater equality, respect for\nindividual difference, and universality, Lacan's insights, like\nFreud's, point toward the precariousness of identity and social\nbonds and to the instability of the drives that attach us to one\nanother. Subjectivity and sexuality are not natural adaptations\nbut deviations, detours, breaks from nature that undermine identity and\ndivide or limit any unity of self or community. In addition to\nthe distinctiveness of his method, focus, and insight, this willingness\nto grapple with the limits of self-mastery is one reason why Lacan has been taken\nas an innovative and amenable resource for some feminist theorists.\nIn exposing the inadequacies of social or empirical accounts of\nsexual difference, identity, and the power relations built upon them,\nLacan confronts the fundamental structures at the root of empirical\nsocio-historical circumstances.\n4. French Feminism\n\nFrench Feminism is in many ways a misnomer since the authors thus\ncharacterized are rarely of French origin or nationality (although\nFrench is the predominant language of their writing) and not\nnecessarily overtly self-identified as feminist. The writers\naffiliated with French Feminism, including Luce Irigaray, Julia\nKristeva, Sarah Kofman, Catherine Clement, and Helene Cixous, among\nothers, variously ask about the relation between the maternal and the\nfeminine, doubt that we can say what a woman is, worry about\nFreud\u2019s lack of attention to mothers, play with writing style,\nwonder about feminine subjectivity, ask if women can be subjects or\ncitizens without adapting to masculine norms, impeach Lacan\u2019s\nphallocentrism, and suspect that access to language assimilates women\ninto neutralized brothers. Unlike Beauvoir, they are philosophically\nand temperamentally more sympathetic to the split of subjectivity\ndetailed by psychoanalysis, the idea that I am not I, that\nself-division rather than self-identity is the fundamental feature of\nhuman existence, and therefore that the subject is not a unitary point\nof origin for choice. Like Beauvoir, they ask whether the structures\nof femininity and the structures of subjectivity are compatible,\ncommensurable, reconcilable, and are vexed by the apprehension that\nthey are fundamentally at odds. While they aim to disentangle\nfemininity from maternity, and provide a critique of their conflation,\nthey also take seriously the significance of maternity for women and\nfor children of both sexes. Because they concede the limits of\nsocio-cultural explanations for women\u2019s lack of standing in the\nsocial contract, and take femininity and the feminine body as points\nof departure for speech or writing, they have often been accused of\nessentialism. Below I focus on the work of Irigaray and Kristeva,\nexamining how they engage with and transform the ideas of Freud and\nLacan, and how they articulate sexual difference as integrally\nconnected to the foundation, and disruption, of a symbolic order.\n4.1 The Impasse of Feminine Subjectivity\n\nIrigaray characterizes her own project as taking place in three\nstages: first, deconstructing the masculine subject; second, figuring\nthe possibility for a feminine subject; and third, construing an\nintersubjectivity that respects sexual difference (Irigaray 1995a:\n96). Sexual difference, in her view, is not a system of domination to\nbe overcome but a cultural process and practice to be achieved and\nnourished; the actual relations of domination and subordination that\ncharacterize Western politics, society, history, literature, language,\nand law, epitomize for Irigaray the reign of sexual\nindifference, the fraternal order of equal brothers/citizens that\nis inattentive to the self-division of nature, its immanent sexual\ndifferentiation. Irigaray\u2019s writings implicate Freud in this\nculture of sexual indifference, his work a symptom of masculine\nmetaphysics and its dream of self-identity and self-mastery. I will\ndiscuss Irigaray\u2019s understanding of sexual indifference further\nbelow, after first describing and elucidating her style of\nwriting.\n\nIrigaray\u2019s writing style is often mimetic, an approach that she\nclaims has been \u201chistorically assigned to the feminine\u201d\n(Irigaray 1977 [1985b: 76]) and therefore that she adopts deliberately\nin order to \u201ctry to recover the place of her exploitation by\ndiscourse\u201d (1977 [1985b: 76]). Irigaray\u2019s writing does not\nproceed propositionally, laying down theses and supporting arguments,\nnor is it formulated through conventionally linear explanations. This\nis not to say, of course, that she does not draw conclusions or that\nher writing is empty of insight. But these insights are reached by\nmirroring the text she is reading, allowing it to play out its\ntensions and contradictions, juxtaposing, transfiguring, and\nintensifying its crises and putting its parapraxes (its textual and\nconceptual slips of the tongue) on display. Her writing is driven by\nthe vagaries of the author before her, and makes appear, or unmasks,\nthe structuring forces of the text and its impasses and limits. This\nreading strategy goes to work on the unconscious logic of a text,\nrevealing the author\u2019s underlying fantasies and anxieties by\namplifying and reflecting them, and thereby attempting to loosen the\nmasculine hold on the symbolic by conveying its unstated postulates\nand conversing from a different perspective. Intently attentive to the\nsignifer, to the words and silences of psychoanalytic texts, she aims\nto retrieve the bodily in language, something underlying symbolic\nprocesses of representation, and to invent a new language and imagine\nnew forms.\n\nSpeculum of the Other Woman (her dissertation and the work\nthat got her exiled from the Lacanian school) includes \u201cThe\nBlind Spot of an Old Dream of Symmetry,\u201d Irigaray\u2019s long\nessay on Freud\u2019s writings on femininity. Irigaray\u2019s essay\non Freud begins by tackling head-on his articulation of the riddle of\nfemininity (Irigaray 1974 [1985a: 13]) in his lecture on\n\u201cFemininity.\u201d Here already we can recognize both\nIrigaray\u2019s unique style and her critical project, and the way\nthese two features of her writing are imbricated and entangled with\none another, propelling a distinctively mimetic method of reading,\nrepeating, and reproducing the text, mirroring Freud\u2019s\nspeculative discourse but also transforming and sabotaging its terms.\nHer text opens as Freud\u2019s does, with his words, and is comprised\nof long quotations that follow the course of Freud\u2019s essay.\nInsofar as this appropriation might at first appear as the passive\nlistening of a dutiful daughter, Irigaray performs a kind of\nmasquerade of femininity: receptive, submissive, obedient. But this\nperformance does not merely reiterate or reproduce; in exemplifying\nthe ways in which women have no language of their own, can only speak\nin or through the voice of the father, she is establishing the\nsymbolic terrain upon which any critique must move while also\nsubverting its presuppositions. Her own words are inserted as\ncommentary, question, counterpoint, breaking open the Freudian text,\nusurping its privileges, revealing its wounds. By engaging Freud in a\nconversation, she insists on her own status as a speaking subject, and\nnot merely an object of study in support of the expansion of a\nsexist science.\n\nIrigaray\u2019s insistence on her own speech is especially crucial\ngiven Freud\u2019s reprimand to women: \u201cyou are yourselves the\nproblem\u201d (Freud 1933 [1968: 113]). Freud\u2019s lecture had\nventured to address the question of sexual difference, and had\nendeavored to complicate rather than simplify our perceptions and\ncertainties concerning its meaning and status. Irigaray, however, by\nretrieving and replaying Freud\u2019s voice, attempts to show that he\nremains caught up in certainties and dogmatisms about sex, so that\nultimately his discourse is one of sexual indifference, as I\nwill discuss next. Freud is thus not the master of Irigaray\u2019s\nessay: his words do not so much determine her trajectory as reveal\ntheir own (freely) associative character, his own unmastery, the egoic\nand identificatory fantasies that haunt his texts on femininity.\n\nAccording to Irigaray, Freud\u2019s work is sexually indifferent\nbecause of its assumption of a kind of symmetry or harmony between\nmasculine and feminine identities and sexualities. With regard to\nsexual desire, Freud assumes that \u2018normal\u2019 women will\ndesire men and be desired by them and thus that each sex can fulfill\nthe longings of the other. With regard to sexual identity, Freud\nmodels the feminine Oedipal Complex on a masculine paradigm and\norigin, with the feminine as its distorted copy. In both cases, Freud\ncontrives to understand women as the complementary other to men, an\nother modeled on the same. Irigaray considers this to be a monosexual,\nhomosocial economy governed by specular opposition or mirroring. It is\nthis sexual indifference that is referenced in the title of\nIrigaray\u2019s essay as \u201cthe old dream of symmetry.\u201d\nBut, as also indicated by her title, Irigaray believes this dream is\npremised on a \u201cblindspot.\u201d Freud characterizes the\ngirl\u2019s relation to the maternal figure as an \u201cespecially\ninexorable repression\u201d (Freud 1931 [1968: 226]) and views the\nlittle girl as a little man; the mother/daughter relation is not seen\nor apprehended by him. The crime here, in Irigaray\u2019s view, is\nmatricide and the suppression of maternal genealogies or lines of\ndescent. The law of the father, the patrimonial order by which sons\ninherit the father\u2019s name by submitting to his prohibitions,\nprivileging this name over the maternal body, appropriates even birth\nto the father. The maternal lineage is suppressed. Irigaray argues\nthat this means that a pre-Oedipal mother-daughter relationship has\nnot been taken up by the signifying order; in fact that order\nretroactively denies that such a relation ever existed, since a\ndaughter becomes a daughter properly, becomes feminized or sexually\ndifferentiated (as a girl or woman), only post-Oedipally. In Lacanian\nterms, Freud excludes the mother/daughter relation from the symbolic\norder. Not only is the maternal connection lost or repressed, but the\nability to name or identify the loss as a loss is also barred.\nBanished from memory, the loss of the mother cannot be mourned.\nIrigaray claims that it is this genealogical asymmetry, with the\nfather\u2019s name memorialized and the mother\u2019s body\nsacrificed to it, that sustains the legitimacy of patriarchy and\npropels the fantasy of a harmony of sexual difference, the conviction\nthat the sexes are reciprocal and complementary in their identities\nand desires.\n\nSexual difference, in Irigaray\u2019s reading of Freud, is thus\nsubsumed under or derived from \u201cthe problematics of\nsameness\u201d (Irigaray 1974 [1985a: 26]) and oriented by the\nfantasy of auto-genesis, being one\u2019s own origin, an ideal of\nself-mastery that is not threatened by any real difference.\nFreud\u2019s account of sexuality presupposes that the sexual subject\nis male, and even that there are no women, only mothers or those\ndestined to become mothers, that is that the meaning of being a woman\nis fully exhausted in the meaning of being a mother. In the psychical\npre-history of the little girl as elaborated in the idea that\n\u201cthe little girl is a little man\u201d (Freud 1933 [1968:\n118]), she will not have been a daughter. As little girls diverge from\nlittle boys, as they cease to be little men, they are expected to be\nappealing visual objects, the mirror of men\u2019s desires, enabling\nmen to represent themselves, shore up their self-image with an adoring\nreflection. Irigaray sees in this account a masculine desire for\nwomen\u2019s desire to be directed toward men. Women are expected to\nprovide the mirror that supports men\u2019s projects, nurtures and\nnourishes their identities, energizes their drive for mastery, by\npresenting themselves as an alter ego. This imaginary, specular, order\nis matricidal, feeding on the blood of women, leaving unpaid its\nfundamental debt to the mother, and abandoning the subjectivity of the\ndaughter. By repressing dependence on the maternal origin of life, the\nmasculine is marked as originary, that from which differentiation\nproceeds. What functions as a primal loss for boys/sons, the cause of\ntheir desire, can only function as a gap in language, an absence of\nmeaning for girls/daughters, an exile from desire, language, and other\nwomen, an irretrievable void that cannot be recuperated in language\nbecause it is instigated by language, by the entry into symbolic order\ncalled forth by the paternal prohibition of the father\u2019s\nno/name. Irigaray\u2019s concern is that for Freud, the mother is\nonly a mirror and her relationship is always to a son; there are no\nmother/daughter relations. Not only is Western culture premised on\nmatricide, which she claims is more primordial than the patricide of\nTotem and Taboo, but this matricide is forgotten and the\nmother remains unmourned.\n\nRepressing any maternal genealogy, political life has been predicated\non the lineage between fathers and sons and the bonds of brotherhood,\nappropriating universality and citizenship to men and rendering women\nas objects of their desire and exchange. The exploitation of women is\nnot merely a phenomenon that takes place within the social order, it\nis its very foundation and premise. Irigaray calls the fraternal order\n\u201chom(m)osexuality,\u201d meaning both that it is an order of\nthe same (homo) and that it is the order of men (homme): the regime of\nsexual indifference ignores relations among women, and especially\nbetween mothers and daughters, and situates women as the medium of\nmen\u2019s alliances with one another, as the buried support and\nenergetic reserves of the body politic. This forgetting of the mother\nsupports vertical and horizontal relations between men but leaves\nwomen unrepresented in language (as subjects) and incapable of\nachieving representation in the body politic (as citizens).\nIrigaray\u2019s own project thus aims to criticize the hom(m)osexual\norder and its specular economy, to reinvigorate mother/daughter\nrelations to make possible a feminine subjectivity, and to cultivate\nsexual difference in the political realm, in civil identity.\nDeveloping the resources for transformation, i.e., for women to become\ncitizens and subjects, entails disrupting the transmission of power\nbetween men and rethinking the passage from nature to culture\nrepresented by the Oedipal Complex. This task requires intervening in\nthe symbolic and imaginary realms, creating a new language that would\nnot be severed from the body and ending the division of labor between\nlove and law.\n\nThe structure of the representational economy, its association of\nsubjectivity with masculinity, precludes the convergence of being a\nwoman and being a speaking being. Although of course there are words\nfor women, these words constitute her only with reference to\nmasculinity, as a photographic negative of man, or in response to a\npatriarchal exertion of feminine norms and expectations. They secure\nher in a masculine universe, they say in advance what she is, they\nrender her captive to an idea of feminine essence. By contrast,\nIrigaray seeks to create a representation for women that would not be\na designation of what she is, defining her by and holding her to some\nconcrete essence, but would allow her to exist on her own terms and\nspeak for herself. Irigaray believes that this type of\nself-determination is barred by the exclusion of mother-daughter\ngenealogies, an exclusion that works to assign woman to a maternal\ndestiny (as mothers of men). Neither denotative nor expressive,\nneither speaking of woman (as though woman were a determinate object\nof study) nor speaking as one (as though the aim were to express an\ninner essence), Irigaray\u2019s writing establishes a reflexive\nrelation to language. By acquiescing, in her mimetic writing style, to\nthe cultural expectation of feminine artifice, Irigaray stages her own\nexiled agency and thereby extends the possibilities for being a woman\nto include being not only an object in or reference of language but a\ntransformer of language. Without claiming to say what a woman really\nis, to get right what the symbolic order gets wrong, she shows that in\nspeaking differently, the very meaning of being a woman (or being a\nman) can be transformed, so that sexual difference remains open to new\npossibilities. She thus does not so much refute Freud\u2019s account\nof the Oedipal Complex and the little girl\u2019s purported\nmasculinity as re-present its primal crime against women, the Oedipal\nexclusion of maternal dependency, thereby altering the scene of its\nrepresentation.\n\nIrigaray also challenges the Lacanian idea of the law of the father\nand the phallic signifier, pillorying the way in which natural birth\nhas been assigned to maternity while cultural birth is assigned to\npaternity, equating the woman-mother with body and the man-father with\nlanguage and law, and relegating the bodily process of parturition\n(maternity) to mute nature while valorizing the symbolic process of\nlegitimation (paternity) as constitutive of civilization. Human\nsubjectivity has been masculinized, while human flesh is both\nfeminized and animalized. Irigaray aims to provoke a legitimation\ncrisis in the paternal legacy and the name of the father that bestows\non the child a political and familial identity.\n\nThe erasure of sexual difference enables a metaphysics of substance in\nwhich sexual identity is a matter of fixed and pre-determined being,\nof underlying essences or common properties, rather than a form of\nbecoming and self-generation. Irigaray\u2019s genealogical account of\nsexual difference resists both the idea of an invariant universal (and\nhence sexually neutral) human essence that subtends (and thereby\nexpels) human multiplicity and the idea of sexual essences that\nconsist in self-enclosed identities between which there is an\nuncrossable divide. That is, she rejects the ontological assumptions\nof both universal equality and separatism, taking both to be\nimplicitly masculine and patriarchal, bound to a metaphysical\nessentialism that aims to capture diversity in first or final\nprinciples, or to subsume particulars under general concepts.\nChallenging the logic of the one and the many, Irigaray takes the\nself-division of nature, its being-two, as a model of autonomous\nself-development. When Irigaray says that human nature is two, she\ndoes not mean that there are two fixed sexual substances, but that to\nbe natural is to be embodied, finite, divided, that the fundamental\ncharacter of nature is growth through differentiation. Human nature,\nin her view, is not disembodied or neutral; it is always distinctively\nsexed or sexuate, a neologism for sexed, but not necessarily erotic,\nbodily difference. Viewing the natural body as self-differentiating\nrather than self-identical, Irigaray also articulates distinctive\ncapacities for generation corresponding to differing morphological\npossibilities (the possibilities of bodily form) that entail\n\u201cdifferent subjective configurations\u201d (Irigaray 1994\n[2001: 137]).\n\nIf human nature is two, and always divided, Irigaray argues, then\ncivil identity is also two and divided; the two of nature needs to be\nbrought into the two of culture. The one is an illusion of patriarchy,\nwhile the two threatens the phallocentric order and challenges the\nsupposition that universality must be singular. The scandalous idea of\na feminine subjectivity means that the universal must be doubled.\nDoubling the universal does not, for Irigaray, mean merely replacing a\nneutral universality (something that holds true for all human beings)\nwith two wholly distinct and separate truths. A universal that has\nbeen doubled has also been split or divided from itself, no longer\none, and Irigaray sees in this the possibility for cultivating sexual\ndifference and overcoming a culture of sexual indifference that is\ndependent on the idea of the generic human.\n\nIf the other has always been formulated on the basis of the same, as\nmerely a specific difference from some underlying generic identity,\nthere has only been complementarity and opposition, there has never\nbeen an actual other subject, each with its own path of development.\nWomen have mirrored men\u2019s subjectivities, reflected their egos\nback to them in an illusion of wholeness and unity, submitted to the\ndemand that they perform or masquerade femininity. Given this\ncriticism of the exploitation of otherness, and despite her criticism\nof a feminist politics of equality, Irigaray thus cannot be\nsimplistically aligned with the project of difference, if this means\nasserting features of women\u2019s biological or social specificity\nas essential and innately valuable attributes, since these Irigaray\ntakes to be framed already and in advance by a patriarchal symbolic\nand imaginary order. Irigaray\u2019s affirmation of sexual difference\ndoes not mean affirming the feminine traits that have been ascribed to\nwomen, since these are actually, in her view, the traits of sexual\nindifference, defined only with reference to men. Sexual difference\nhas yet to appear and it is her task to bring it into being.\n\nBeing-two is counterposed to the metaphysical alteration between the\none and the many, with its incessant oscillation between the\nessentialism of a rigid identity and the laissez-faire contingency,\nindependent of any determining essence, of unlimited multiplicity and\natomistic individualism. It is on the basis of this being-two that\nIrigaray attempts to build an ethics of sexual difference, a political\nrelation between-two, with civil rights appropriate to sexuate\nidentity, so that one\u2019s identity as a citizen is not cut off\nfrom the body, and law is not severed from nature. If sexual\ndifference is not simply an effect of oppression, then freedom does\nnot mean freedom from sexed embodiment. While political neutrality can\nonly recognize disembodied subjects deprived of their bodily life, for\nIrigaray, citizens are not abstractions. The doubled, non-neutral,\nuniversal allows for distinctively feminine (and distinctively\nmasculine) subjects to be recognized politically.\n\nSimilarly to Beauvoir, who ascertains that language and culture\nconstitute the subject as masculine, and the feminine as other to him,\nIrigaray maintains that inhabiting a feminine subjectivity is\nparadoxical in a fraternal social order. But, for Irigaray, both\nBeauvoir and Freud fail to address sexual difference insofar as they\nretain a singular notion of masculine subjectivity, Freud because he\npresumes the libido is always masculine, and Beauvoir because she\nreckons the aim of women\u2019s emancipation as equality with men\n(for instance by concluding the Second Sex with a call to\nbrotherhood and seeming, arguably, to be calling for women to\nassimilate to masculine norms of selfhood). Irigaray rejects the\nproject of equality, since \u2018equality\u2019 can only ever mean\nequality to men, and proposes instead doubling the notion of\nsubjectivity in line with the subject\u2019s own self-division. This\nmight seem unnecessary, especially to equality-oriented feminists,\nsince of course, women can, at least in much of the liberal,\ndemocratic world, be citizen-subjects, just like men. But\nIrigaray\u2019s point is that women can have the rights of men only\nso long as they are like men, i.e., insofar as they are brothers,\nsubsumed into the neutral individuality of the liberal social\ncontract. This purportedly equal access to citizenship and\nsubjectivity thus does not resolve the paradox, since it merely takes\nthe side of subjectivity over that of femininity, retaining the\nconstitution of the feminine as lack, the inverted image of man, the\nother of the same, that which stands in the way of political agency\nand obstructs autonomy, and which thus must be overcome in order to\nachieve self-determination. In the prevailing social contract,\nfemininity and subjectivity remain opposed.\n\nIrigaray does not think she can say what a woman is or what femininity\nis. Familial, social, and symbolic mechanisms of exchange have denied\nfemininity its own images and language, fashioning women through\nmen\u2019s language, images, and desires, and thereby producing an\napparent, but false, symmetry within a single, monotonous, language.\nAgainst this homogeny, with its same and its other, Irigaray construes\nthe production or work of sexual difference, sexual difference as a\nrelation between-two, to be the path toward liberating both femininity\nand masculinity from their metaphysical and political constraints by\nallowing them each to cultivate their own interdependent natures. The\nidea of a between-two does not mean a singular path that is shared by\nboth, but rather indicates, in addition to the value of a specifically\nfeminine sexual identity and a specifically masculine sexual identity,\nthe ethical path of an intersubjective relationality that allows them\nto appreciate and value one another. Since the between-two is premised\non being-two (self-differentiated), it is in the cultivation of this\nsexual difference that we will find the possibility of an ethical\nsexual relation, what Irigaray calls an ethics of sexual difference.\nFor Irigaray, then, contra Lacan, there can be a sexual relation.\nIrigaray\u2019s undertaking thus involves not merely an assertion of\ndifference against equality, nor certainly a simple reversal; such\nstances take place on the basis of an already existing symbolic order\nand imaginary relation and are themselves what need to be\ninterrogated. To find a language for feminine sexuality and feminine\nsubjectivity, we must go \u201cback through the dominant\ndiscourse\u201d (Irigaray 1977 [1985b: 119]) with its metaphysical\nassumptions of substance or essence, and its concept of identity which\nadheres to the regime of sexual indifference.\n\nAlthough Irigaray often invokes the maternal as the source of life and\nsubjectivity, she does not equate maternity with femininity or the\nmother with the woman. Among many others, Jessica Benjamin (whose work\nwill be discussed below) seems to share the mistaken view that\nIrigaray\u2019s theoretical project is premised upon valorizing\n\u201cfemale genitals as a starting point for a different\ndesire\u201d (Benjamin 1988: 276). No doubt this (mis)interpretation\nstems from Irigaray\u2019s\u00a0text \u201cWhen Our Lips Speak\nTogether.\u201d But what Irigaray means by \u2018speaking from the\nbody\u2019 is moving away from a singular conception of origin and\ndesire, and most especially the origin of desire. Her writing of\nwomen\u2019s bodies, like her retrieval of mother/daughter\ngenealogies is a strategy of language and imagination, situating the\nbody as fluid border, the site of the overflow of culture into nature\nand vice versa, rather than a self-enclosed egoic center. She is not\nan essentialist who views women\u2019s biology as their destiny.\nInstead she challenges the nature/culture divide, and the either/or of\nbiology or civilization.\n4.2 Subjectivity, Alterity, and Alienation\n\nWhile often grouped together in cursory overviews of so-called French\nFeminism, Irigaray and Kristeva have fundamentally disparate projects\n(and locations in the academy), both with regard to their critical\nanalyses and with regard to their political enterprises. Whereas\nIrigaray was a student of Lacan who breaks with (even as she is\ninspired by) his teachings from her earliest work, Kristeva has a much\nmore ambiguous relationship to his school of thought and was never his\nstudent or attended his seminars. Their respective views can perhaps\nbest be captured with respect to their attitude toward the symbolic\nviolence of castration (the Oedipal Complex) and the social contract.\nAs explained above, Irigaray envisions a sexuate culture that would\novercome the Oedipal demands of a sacrificial economy and restore\nfeminine genealogies to the work of civilization. Kristeva, by\ncontrast, argues that there is no subjectivity beyond sacrifice and\ndoes not believe Oedipus can or should be overcome. Kristeva and\nIrigaray do not form a cohort and they do not respond to each\nother\u2019s writings. But they both have psychoanalytic training and\npractices and both attend to the body and the drives, taking up the\ntheme of loss or exile of the mother\u2019s body and the impact of\nmatricide on social relations. Kristeva even (echoing Irigaray)\ncondemns humanism as \u201cthe fraternity of the same\u201d\n(Kristeva 1998: 168) and, like Irigaray, she plays with writing style,\noffering experimental, innovative, sometimes imagistic portraits of\npsychical moods, maternal practices, and artistic endeavors.\n\nKristeva\u2019s connection to feminist thought is also unsettled and\nvolatile, although her focus on questions pertaining to language,\nfemininity, and the maternal body has made her work amenable to\nfeminist interest and development. In her essay \u201cWomen\u2019s\nTime,\u201d she classifies the feminist movement into three distinct\ntimes or generations, each with its own approach to and vision of\njustice. The first generation is universalist in principle and aspires\nto give women a place within history and the social contract; this\ngeneration takes equality as its mission and asserts women\u2019s\nidentification with the dominant values of rationality. Kristeva\naligns Beauvoir with this project of pursuing access to universal\nsubjectivity. The second generation is reactive, rejecting the idea of\nassimilation to values taken to be masculine; this generation insists\non feminine difference. While Kristeva does not mention Irigaray, it\nseems clear that Kristeva would align her with this strategy and the\nproject of recognizing feminine specificity. In Kristeva\u2019s view,\nthe first generation is so committed to universal equality that it\ndenies bodily difference, and the second generation is so committed to\ndifference that it refuses to partake of a history it deems to be\nmasculine. The third generation follows neither the path of fixing\nidentity nor the path of neutralizing difference in the medium of\nuniversality. Instead it embraces ambiguity and non-identity,\nrespecting both the value of participating in historical time and the\nineluctability of bodily difference. The third generation recognizes\nthat it is as embodied beings that we enter into the social contract\nand community with others.\n\nSince Kristeva believes that there is no subjectivity and no sociality\nwithout the violence of the symbolic contract and the splitting of\nsubjectivity, the feminism that she proposes would not take refuge\nfrom this violence either by standing outside history (as the second\ngeneration does), or by denying women\u2019s bodies and desires (as\nthe first generation does). Taking seriously the intransigence of\nsexual difference, and the violent fractures within and of identity,\nKristeva advocates feminist support for alienation that would not\npretend to reconcile the rupture between body and law (what Lacan\ncalls castration) and would refuse the solace of identity.\nKristeva mentions the bodily experience of pregnancy, an experience of\nbeing split, of being two in one, as manifesting the instability of,\nand alterity within, identity.\n\nThis insistence on the fragility and precariousness of identity can be\ngrasped in the first instance by looking at Kristeva\u2019s\nunderstanding of the drives and language. Kristeva introduces the\nnotion of the semiotic as the affective dimension of language that\nfacilitates its energetic movement. The semiotic is the materiality of\nlanguage, its tonal and rhythmic qualities, its bodily force. In\nKristeva\u2019s account, the drives are not simply excluded by\nlanguage but also inscribed as an alien element within it. While more\nprimitive than signification, the semiotic participates in signifying\npractices.\n\nKristeva\u2019s elaboration of the semiotic situates it at a point\nprior to the Lacanian imaginary, i.e., prior to the moment at which\nthe infant identifies with its own ego and distinguishes itself from\nan object. Still in porous relation to another body, without clear\nborders or limits, the infant is propelled by the anarchic,\nheterogenous, rhythmic flow of drive energy \u201cwhich has no thesis\nand no position\u201d (Kristeva 1974 [1984: 26]). Mobile and\nprovisional, moving through the body of the not-yet subject, the\nsemiotic is a chaotic force anterior to language, unlocalizable\nbecause it courses through an as yet undifferentiated materiality in\nwhich the infantile body is not yet distinct from the maternal body.\nKristeva calls this stage pre-thetic since it is prior to the reign of\npropositions, judgments, positions, and theses, these being subsequent\npossibilities that might arrest or seize a movement that always\nexceeds them. Since the image is itself a kind of sign, a first\nrepresentation, the advent of the imaginary demarcates the first\nthetic break, a break from nature and into the realm of convention.\nWhat Kristeva means by the thetic then includes both the imaginary\n(the mirror stage) and the symbolic (the Oedipal Complex) dimensions\nof Lacan. Only with the advent of the thetic phase, the\n\u201cthreshold of language\u201d (Kristeva 1974 [1984: 45]), can\nthere be said to be signification proper along with negation as\njudgment. In thereby altering Lacan\u2019s understanding of the\nimaginary or mirror stage, she attends to the pre-Oedipal mother/child\nrelation in a way he does not, while also elaborating on an\nunderdeveloped theme in Freud\u2019s work.\n\nFreud distinguishes between auto-erotism and primary narcissism,\nattributing to the latter a new psychical action. While auto-erotism\nprecedes the formation of the ego and the individuation of the self,\nprimary narcissism only ensues with the preliminary development of\negoic unity, when the ego is able to demarcate itself from the\nsurrounding world and take itself for an object. The semiotic\ncorresponds to the diffuse drive energy of auto-erotism and Kristeva\ntakes up Freud\u2019s challenge to assess the psychical action of\nego-formation that enables primary narcissism, which she attributes to\na primary identification with the imaginary father. In Tales of\nLove, which jumps off from Freud\u2019s claim in The Ego and\nthe Id that identification with the father of individual\npre-history is prior to and more primary than object-cathexis,\nKristeva offers an original account of the pre-Oedipal period, finding\na paternal figure there. Since the bond of identification precedes any\nbond with objects, the imaginary father is what makes possible the\ninitial separation between ego and object, or rather proto-ego and\nproto-object. This father is not the first object, but the first\nidentification, making language and love possible, movement within and\namong a world of others. This identification, Kristeva hypothesizes,\nalters maternal space, interrupts it with something beyond its\nborders. But it also indicates that there is a preliminary pre-thetic\nsymbolic capacity at work in infantile life. As the drives expel,\ndetach, or isolate a proto-object, the space of differentiation is\nsupported by identification with the imaginary father, who holds it\nopen. The imaginary father is here associated with love (unlike the\nsymbolic father who is associated with law), an invitation to language\nand subjectivity, to become a being who can have relations with\nothers.\n\nKristeva accepts Freud\u2019s insight that the thetic break, or the\nprohibitory break of the Oedipal Complex and the dead father, that\nfounds law and sociality is violent and murderous (Kristeva 1974\n[1984: 70]). The capacity for representation transforms our perceptual\nuniverse, entailing that no bodily immediacy is possible, that all\nexperience will be mediated by significatory practices and filtered\nthrough the ego\u2019s organization. But although this rent in\nexperience is suffered by the signifying child as a loss to be\nmourned, it is also, Kristeva claims, a gift, the gift of a self that\ncan navigate language. With words and memories available, the child\ncan compensate for the loss of objects in perception (in the exemplary\ncase, learning to endure the mother\u2019s absence). On\nKristeva\u2019s view, \u201cthe structural violence of\nlanguage\u2019s irruption as the murder of soma, the transformation\nof the body, the captation of drives\u201d (Kristeva 1974 [1984:\n75]), is preceded by a loving father who makes possible the\npreliminary individuation of the infant from the mother. Although\nsymbolic violence is integral to the maintenance of a social order,\nthe promise of language on Kristeva\u2019s account is initially\nbrought forward by love, not by law. Unlike Irigaray, who wants to\nretrieve the pre-Oedipal period in order to reclaim feminine\ngenealogies, Kristeva wants only to redescribe it in order to reassess\nits import for individuation and creative self-transformation. She\ntakes infantile matricide (separation from the mother) to be a\nnecessary condition of subjectivity and not a remnant of patriarchal\nviolence.\n\nStill, Kristeva charts differing arcs for the paternal and maternal\nrelationships in the constitution of subjectivity. The imaginary\nfather empowers a new psychic space premised on the distinction\nbetween internal and external, self and other. The breaking in of the\nsignifier inaugurates individuation, the assumption of bodily form and\ncorporeal unity, and thereby entails loss of the maternal body. In\nKristeva\u2019s view, matricide, repression of the maternal body, is\na necessary event on the way to subjectivity. The bodily exchange\nbetween mother and child can serve as a barrier to love, imprisoning\nthe child in an overwhelming bond. The loving mother provides the\nfirst approach to language and law by demonstrating love for an object\nwho is not the child, a third outside this dyad who makes the dyadic\nrelationship itself possible and releases the emotional pressure of\nit. The loving father proffers a kind of promise, even as he disrupts\nfusion with the mother, allowing and encouraging the child to\nrepresent itself. Kristeva\u2019s thought here follows Lacan\u2019s\nidea that a mother whose only object of desire is her child will\nproduce a child who cannot move beyond the psychosis of being the\nphallus for her.\n\nSignification and language are sites of sublimation, creative workings\nout of the drives, but they can be stalled by abjection and\nmelancholia which are both preconditions for, but also limits to,\nsubjectification. Kristeva identifies abjection and melancholia as\nsites of psychical (and social) crisis rooted in narcissistic\ndisorder. In them, the tenuous processes of ego-formation risk\ncollapse; faced with difficulty clarifying the boundaries of the self,\nthe subject reverts to ambivalent aggressivity. While Kristeva\nunderstands narcissism to be a fundamental, if unstable, structure of\nthe psyche, abjection and melancholia are problematic relations to the\nmaternal body and its loss (or the malfunctioning of its loss). They\nare experiences of disintegration or dissolution of the ego without\nreorganization, but also of its rabid fortification.\n\nIn Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection, the abject is\ndescribed as neither inside nor outside, neither subject nor object,\nneither self nor other, troubling identity and order with the\ninstability of boundaries, borders, and limits. Kristeva offers the\nexamples of bodily fluids, sweat, blood, pus, milk, as non-objects\nthat are banished in the course of ego-formation. These non-objects\nalso include the mother\u2019s body; indeed the maternal body is a\nprivileged site of abjection, as it is that which must be excluded in\norder for individuation and separation to take place, so that one can\ndistinguish self from other and establish a dyadic (imaginary)\nrelation out of undifferentiated maternal space or the semiotic\nchora, the pre-spatial relation of fluid (although not\nentirely unregulated) drives. The abject can then also be called the\nprimally repressed, primal because prior not only to the secondary\nsymbolic prohibition of the incest taboo or Oedipal Complex, but also\nprior to the establishment of any identity.\n\nThe abject is horrifying, repellent, but also fascinating; it is\nstrange but familiar. The process of abjection is not merely a symptom\nof phobia or borderline disorder, but a necessary and even recurring\nordeal in any subject\u2019s transition to identification with the\nfather and accession to language. It is the most archaic form of\nnegativity, an exclusion or expulsion which functions by securing the\nborders of self, carving a space, marking a divide, out of which the\nego can emerge. Kristeva calls it the violent attempt \u201cto\nrelease the hold of maternal entity\u201d (Kristeva 1980\n[1982: 13]) or rather what will have been the mother, since this\nprocess establishes the distinction between the maternal body and the\ninfant in the first place, making possible primary narcissism. The\nabject exposes the precariousness of the subject/object divide, the\nfragility of identity, the need to constitute oneself against the\nthreat of, and desire for, dissolution.\n\nAlthough this is not primarily Kristeva\u2019s concern, abjection can\nalso be understood as a social phenomenon, one with political\nimplications. The psychically primitive experience of egoic\ninstability can be propelled into the political realm, and be socially\naccentuated or reinforced. In abjection, subjects confront what they\nmust exclude or expel in order to maintain identity, that is, they\nconfront their own dependency, mortality, finitude, and materiality.\nThis strangeness experienced at the porous edges of identity can\nrebound into troubling relations with others, including especially\nwith others who are perceived as lacking intelligible identity,\nsocially marginal, or refusing cultural assimilation. While\nKristeva\u2019s own focus is less on what is abjected than the\nprocess of abjection, that is, less on the expelled non-object than on\nthe violence of separation that brings objects (and others) into\nbeing, her work provides the theoretical underpinnings to ask\nquestions about who bears the burden of abjection, how and why some\nare figured as inhuman, animal, or alien. Her analysis of abjection\nexposes the ways in which social life is dependent on jettisoning or\ncontaining disorder and disruption, and managing the fear of\ncontamination.\n\nThe confusion of borders, the ambivalent relation to maternal space at\nthe outskirts of narcissism, also motivates melancholia. The idea of\nthe maternal as the primally repressed recurs in Black Sun:\nDepression and Melancholia, where Kristeva claims,\n\u201cmatricide is our vital necessity\u201d (Kristeva 1987 [1989:\n27]), the founding partition that facilitates the birth and growth of\nthe ego. Kristeva praises the child, the \u201cintrepid\nwanderer\u201d who \u201cleaves the crib to meet the mother in the\nrealm of representations\u201d (1987 [1989: 41]). Maintaining that\nthe organization of the psyche is premised on loss, Kristeva also\nunderstands that the suffering entailed by loss can derail the\nformation of a self, that loss itself can become the dominant reality\nfor some who are unable to establish a secure relation to themselves.\nWhile mourning, for Kristeva as for Freud, enables a\nsubject to, gradually and painfully, let go of loss by establishing a\nrelation in language to it, melancholia is a practice which enables\nthe subject to hold onto lost objects, most especially the mother or,\nbetter, the dead (or repressed) mother. The loving father facilitates\nmourning and linguistic creativity; the deadening mother disables\nself-creation. The generation of the ego out of expulsion, the\ndivision of unity, is not simply a mournful moment, but also\npotentially a joyous one, in which the advent of language, the promise\nof the father, offers reparation and life with a world of others, so\nthat words can provide the nourishment that the breast previously had.\nThe father makes it possible to fill the void with language and the\nformation of signifying bonds.\n\nIn Kristeva\u2019s understanding of melancholic breakdown, the\nproblem is similar to the one discussed above in the section on\nIrigaray, namely that loss goes unnamed and unmourned but thereby\nstays unprocessed within, leaving the subject stagnant and inert.\nWomen, in Kristeva\u2019s view, suffer the loss of creativity, the\nincapacity for sublimation, more severely than men. Women\u2019s\naccess to language, and creative self-transformation, is more\nvulnerable to disturbance both because of the (previously discussed)\ninexorable repression of their pre-Oedipal relation to the mother and\nbecause they have greater difficulty establishing a primary\nidentification with the father. Whereas the loss of the archaic bond\nwith the maternal body is (potentially) sublated by men into the\nrhythms of language, for women it often becomes a dead space where\nonce there was life, filled only with loss and emptiness. Imprisoned\nby an undead, unmourned, mother, excluded from language or\nrepresentation, women are vulnerable to the devastations of symbolic\nsacrifice without recompense.\n\nPsychoanalysis is presented as a counter-depressant, as are art and\nwriting, able not only to keep the drives or semiotic forces moving\nthrough language but also to foster their revolutionary potential to\ntransgress symbolic limits and laws and to creatively rework self and\nsociety. Accessing the drives and rhythms that symbolic law and order\ntypically repress, psychoanalytic practice, like the poetic text,\nrevitalizes or reactivates the semiotic chora, a connection\nto the maternal body or to femininity. Such practices let loose the\ndisorganizing energies of the body, the pleasurable rupture of sense\nand nonsense. They take productive advantage of the dialectical\ndiscord between semiotic and symbolic and thus keep this discord\noriented toward dissent and protest rather than inner collapse.\n\nAlthough the semiotic resists the symbolic order, or cannot be\ncontained by it, the two are always entangled and imbricated in\nlanguage; drives both support and subvert the symbolic operation,\nbringing bodily rhythms and forces to signification, both impelling\nand pulling apart its organization and stases. This disruptive\npotential of semiotic drives and rhythms is associated with negativity\nas a force of revolt, an excess, most archaically, the force of bodily\nexpulsion, but more generally the forces that continually spur the\ndissolution of one\u2019s own organization. Negativity maintains\nlife, keeps it going by circulating energy, rendering the subject\nalways in process. Through its movement, the subject is not a rigid\nidentity, but always developing, reconfiguring itself through the\ninterplay of drives and language, in the tensions between body and\nmirror image and between mirror image and self.\n\nWhile Kristeva advocates for \u2018poetic revolution,\u2019 (meaning\nthe ongoing process of reconfiguring language and oneself by\nexploiting the heterogeneities between semiotic and symbolic\nelements), she is sometimes read as a conservative thinker because of\nher commitment to maintaining a symbolic order and social contract.\nThe danger of a too strong or too weak symbolic order is that it\nencourages a return to abjection or melancholia, to the point prior to\nego-formation, to a dissolution of the borders that maintain social\nlife and creative subjectivity, contributing to the ego\u2019s\ncollapse into an empty abyssal void and discouraging semiotic\ncreativity. Such a fragile, fragmented, disintegrating ego, always in\nsearch of objects to heal the rift of being, dreaming of a return to\nunity but suffering the nightmare of upheaval and collapse of\nidentity, is especially susceptible to the traumatic impact of\nencountering the stranger, the unfamiliar other or alien who provokes\nturmoil and who is repudiated in a rebound to delirious narcissism and\na reassertion of self-mastery and self-identity. The stranger disturbs\nboundaries, indicating the failure to fully eliminate the refuse of\nidentity and purify oneself. Kristeva sees in the ethics of\npsychoanalysis, premised on self-division, being strange to oneself,\nthe possibility of establishing an ethical relation to alterity,\ninviting it into our political bonds (and warding off the most\nvirulent forms of abjection). Where Irigaray aims to introduce sexual\ndifference into the social contract and the domain of law and rights,\nKristeva proposes that we introduce self-discord.\n5. Anglo-American Psychoanalytic Feminism\n\nThere are a number of Anglo-American (and Australian) feminist\ntheorists and scholars who read Lacan and laid the groundwork for the\npassage from French to English and from France to the US, Britain, and\nAustralia in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. Among these are Juliet\nMitchell (Psychoanalysis and Feminism, 1974), Teresa Brennan\n(The Interpretation of the Flesh: Freud and Femininity,\n1992), Elizabeth Grosz (Jacques Lacan: A Feminist\nIntroduction, 1990), Jane Gallop (Reading Lacan [1985]\nand The Daughter\u2019s Seduction [1982]), and Jacqueline\nRose (Sexuality in the Field of Vision, 1986). While writing\nin English, these theorists take their bearings from the French\nLacanian approach to psychoanalysis and can generally be classified in\nthe field of what today gets called \u201cContinental\nFeminism.\u201d Responsible for revitalizing psychoanalysis for\nfeminist thought and countering earlier feminist dismissals, they aim\nto reclaim Freud\u2019s central analyses for feminist purposes.\nJuliet Mitchell, for instance, develops the insight indispensable to\nany feminist reading, that \u201cpsychoanalysis is not a\nrecommendation for a patriarchal society, but an analysis\nof one\u201d (Mitchell 1974: xiii). Mitchell and Rose are\nalso the co-editors of Feminine Sexuality, a selection from\nLacan\u2019s seminars, for which both editors wrote influential\nintroductions.\n\nThis section will address, however, not the Lacanian inspired feminist\nappropriation of psychoanalysis in the English speaking world, but the\nAnglo-American development of feminist psychoanalysis that has\ndescended from and is indebted to British object relations theory and\nits focus on the pre-Oedipal mother-child bond, especially the work of\nMelanie Klein and Donald Winnicott. Authors who work in this vein\ninclude Nancy Chodorow (The Reproduction of Mothering, 1978),\nDorothy Dinnerstein (The Mermaid and the Minotaur, 1976), and\nJessica Benjamin (Bonds of Love [1988] and Like Subjects,\nLove Objects [1995]). What distinguishes this Anglo-American\ntradition from the French-influenced one is its emphasis on\npre-Oedipal sociality or intersubjectivity and its focus on the values\nof integration, harmony, and wholeness, as opposed to those of\nself-division and respecting the alien within.\u00a0\n\nThe remainder of this section will focus on the work of Benjamin as\nexemplary of the Anglo-American approach, and clarify its differences\nfrom and similarities with the French approach. Like Irigaray,\nBenjamin is perturbed by the psychoanalytic depiction of social life\nas the world of men, developed on the basis of the father-son relation\nand its aggression, hostility, love, and mourning. Deploring this\n\u201cstruggle for power\u201d (Benjamin 1988: 6) in which women are\nmerely the triangulating object of desire, Benjamin argues that, in\nthe formation of identity, subjects become bound by love to oppressive\nsocial relations. She worries that \u201cdomination is anchored in\nthe hearts of the dominated\u201d (1988: 5), that women are\nerotically attached to patriarchal power, and she believes that\npsychoanalysis can help explain how and why this is so. Psychoanalysis\nthus offers to Benjamin insights not only into the individual psyche\nbut also into the organization, structure, and distribution of\npolitical power and hierarchy. Her aim is \u201cto grasp the deep\nstructure of gender as a binary opposition which is common to psychic\nand cultural representations\u201d (1988: 218). Unlike Kristeva and\nIrigaray, both of whom problematize the duality and comprehensiveness\nof the nature/culture distinction, and emphasize transformation of\nsymbolic bonds, Benjamin highlights the role of (contradictory)\ncultural stereotypes in bringing forth gender as we know and live it,\nand emphasizes the need for social transformation.\n\nTaking what she calls an eclectic approach, and eschewing\nmethodological orthodoxy with regard to Freudian metapsychology and\nthe theory of the instincts, Benjamin establishes her project on the\nbasis of a two person relational perspective, with the other as a\nseparate independent subject. Rather than an undifferentiated unity\ngoverning early infantile life in the pre-Oedipal period, which would\nmake of the infant merely a \u201cmonadic energy system\u201d\n(Benjamin 1988: 17), she maintains that a genuine duality and\nrelationality exists from the start and that the process of growth\nentails development within relationships rather than a development of\nthem. The infant, she postulates, is a fundamentally active and social\ncreature, reaching out to the world and expressing a desire for\nrecognition. The knots of identity are formed via the interplay of\nthis desire with the response of another who variously affirms or\ndefies the child. Benjamin claims that this emphasis on sociality and\nintersubjectivity is not intended to disregard the intrapsychic\nelements of subject formation, and in fact she argues for \u201cthe\ninteraction between the psyche and social life\u201d (1988: 5). She\nholds that the inner and the outer are not competitive but\ncomplementary theoretical perspectives. Nonetheless, she does want to\nsituate identity generally, and gendered identity more specifically,\nwithin the purview of the subject\u2019s multiple and ambiguous\nsocial identifications.\n\nDomination, she argues, ensues from the failures of recognition built\ninto the political and social order, not merely failures that take\nplace at the personal or individual level in a single relationship.\nBorrowing an initial insight from Foucault, Benjamin looks at the way\npower shapes and forms identities and desires, producing gendered\nrelations (Benjamin 1988: 4). Borrowing another insight from Hegel,\nBenjamin depicts the dialectic of recognition in the struggle for\nidentity as a \u201cconflict between independence and\ndependence\u201d (1988: 33). In her view, however, the Hegelian tale,\nlike the Freudian one, erroneously begins with a \u201cmonadic,\nself-interested ego\u201d (1988: 33) and it thus concludes with the\ninevitability of breakdown and domination. According to Benjamin,\nWinnicott resolves the Hegelian and Freudian dilemma (Benjamin 1988:\n38), the solitary egoism of the fight to the death, by reformulating\nthe problem of recognition at the level of fantasy and distinguishing\nbetween internal and external worlds. The infant feels confident in\nasserting its independence, and destroying its object in fantasy, so\nlong as that object is discovered to have a secure external existence\nin reality. In other words, the fantasy of destruction is appeased by\nits failure; the infant destroys internally but externally is relieved\nto still have an object to address and interact with. More\nparticularly, the infant destroys or separates from the mother\ninternally and in fantasy, but simultaneously retains a relation to\nher externally and in reality. The good enough mother must foster this\nrelationship between two separate egos, neither allowing the child to\nsucceed in destroying or dominating her, nor allowing herself to\nsquash the child\u2019s nascent attempts at self-assertion. The\nmother-child relation is then a kind of revised neo-Hegelian struggle\nfor power, retaining the aim of mutual recognition or respect, but\nrisking domination and rebellion. The violent conflicts within are not\nrepressed but neutralized and pacified in the reality of\nintersubjective life that affirms and recognizes autonomy.\n\nAsking, as do Chodorow and Dinnerstein, about the genesis of\npatriarchal power, Benjamin concludes, as they also do, that a main\nsource or component lies in exclusive childrearing by women/mothers,\nwhich occasions the related risks of collapsing maternal authority\ninto mere dominance, supporting the fantasy of maternal omnipotence,\ncentering potent ambivalence on the mother, and fostering rigid gender\nidentities and identifications. While the boy attains autonomy via\nloving identification with the father and separation from the mother,\nthe girl\u2019s relation to paternal power is complicated by its\ninaccessibility to her. If she seeks \u201cliberation in the\nfather\u201d (Benjamin 1988: 99), she connects her femininity to\nsubmission rather than agency, and attaches to masculinity as an\nidealized object of love (and as its love-object), conferring on it\nvalue while devaluing the mother, and creating a divide between\nfeminine sexuality and autonomous subjectivity. Benjamin argues,\nhowever, that the \u201cprotean impersonality\u201d (Benjamin 1988:\n216) of male domination cannot be addressed by a critique that focuses\nsolely on the family and childcare and that power relations cannot be\novercome solely through a transformation in caretaking roles, although\nthe equation of women with motherhood is certainly one component of\nthe problem. If gendered identities are encouraged by social power\nrelations\u2014masculinity is developed as a denial of dependency and\nassertion of independence, while femininity is developed in an\nidentification with nurturing and concession of autonomy\u2014then\nreal transformation requires attention to social roles and\n\u201ccultural representations\u201d (Benjamin 1988: 217), since\n\u201cthe core feature of the gender system\u2014promoting\nmasculinity as separation from and femininity as continuity with the\nprimary bond\u2014is maintained even when mother and father\nparticipate equally in that bond\u201d (Benjamin 1988: 217). In\nBenjamin\u2019s theoretical model, children are responsive not only\nto their social environment, but also to ideas with opaque meanings\n(mandates, expectations, prohibitions, exhortations, etc.) that are\noften covertly, indirectly, or unknowingly conveyed in parental\nlanguage and edicts. Gender equality thus requires that women be\nrecognized, by themselves and by men, as subjects in culture and that\nintersubjectivity itself be revalued.\n\nBenjamin\u2019s analysis can be distinguished from those of Irigaray\nand Kristeva precisely by the way in which it tends to conflate or\ncollapse the distinction between representation and social roles.\nWhile Anglo-American psychoanalytic feminism theorizes gender as\nderived from or dependent on social (including familial) inequalities\nand power relations, and thus aims to reduce its psychic effects by\nredressing social and familial domination/subordination, French\nfeminism does not calibrate the psyche on socio-cultural relations but\non imaginary and symbolic representations. Benjamin\u2019s\npartitioning of intrapsychic life into internal and external\nrelations, and her vision of intersubjective equilibrium is, in\ncontrast to Irigaray and Kristeva\u2019s assertion of discord within\nand between subjects, oriented by the conviction that social harmony\nis desirable and attainable.\n6. Conclusion\n\nPsychoanalysis presents a critical and diagnostic project, not\nnecessarily a normative or liberatory one. In developing a theory of\nthe drives and the non-rational forces that move and impel us, the\nidea that we are opaque rather than transparent to ourselves,\nincapable of complete self-knowledge or self-mastery, psychoanalytic\ntheory also challenges the rationalist, humanist ego and proposes that\nour ethical characters and political communities are not perfectable,\nexposing the precariousness of both psychic and political identity.\nThe unconscious cannot be assumed to be inherently either a\ntransgressive or a conservative force, but an unreliable one,\npromoting revolt or rebellion sometimes, intransigence and rigid\nborder preservation at other times.\n\nAlthough they are in often uneasy alliance, the psychoanalytic account\nof the unconscious provides feminist theory with resources for both\npolitical and ontological inquiry. Ontologically, psychoanalysis\noffers a distinctively psychical understanding of sexual difference,\nhow we come to inhabit our bodies and our identities, and misinhabit\nthem, an analysis reducible to neither social nor biological\ncategories. Politically, psychoanalysis offers a depiction of the\nforces that impel us to organize, disorganize, and reorganize the\nbonds that hold us together. By offering insight into the formation of\nsubjectivity and the animating fantasies of social life,\npsychoanalysis thus also facilitates feminist analysis of the obdurate\nelements of patriarchal social relations, including the symbolic bonds\nand internal forces that undergird identity and attach sexed subjects\nto relations of dominance and subordination. Psychoanalytic feminist\nattention to the core constituents of civilization, to the nuclei of\nsexual difference and communal affiliation, helps explain the\nperpetuation of masculine power and enables feminist theorists to\narticulate possible correctives, challenges, routes of amelioration,\nor ethical interruptions that go to the roots of political life and to\nits beyond and do not simply operate on the given social terrain.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"CitWor\">Cited Works</a>", "<a name=\"FurRea\">Further Reading</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"CitWor\">Cited Works</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Barnard, Suzanne and Bruce Fink (eds.), 2002, <em>Reading Seminar\nXX: Lacan\u2019s Major Work on Love, Knowledge, and Feminine\nSexuality</em>, (SUNY Series in Psychoanalysis and Culture), Albany,\nNY: State University of New York Press.", "Beauvoir, Simone de, 1947 [1949], <em>Pour une morale de\nl\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9</em>, (Collection Id\u00e9es), Paris:\nGallimard; translated as <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em>, Bernard\nFrechtman (trans.), New York: Philosophical Library, 1949.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1949 [1989], <em>Le Deuxi\u00e8me\nSexe</em>, Paris: Gallimard; translated as <em>The Second Sex</em>, by\nH.
