    "main_text": "Conceptual Foundations and Motivations || Definition of \u201cultimate\u201d\n1.1 Definition of \u201cultimate\u201d\n\nBrahman, the Dao, emptiness, God, the One, Reasonableness\u2014there,\nin alphabetical order, are names of the central subjects of concern in\nwhat are commonly parsed as some of the world\u2019s religions,\nphilosophies and\n quasi-religious-philosophies.[1]\n They are all names for what is ultimate, at least on some uses of the\nnames (for instance, \u201cGod\u201d is not always taken to be\nultimate, more soon). But what is it to be ultimate, in this\nsense?\n\nTo answer in terms of its use, the term \u201cultimacy\u201d, meaning\nthe state or nature of being ultimate, has Brahman, the Dao, emptiness\netc. as instances. To answer semantically, with a meaning, is\ndifficult for at least two reasons. First, though there is abundant\nprecedent in the literature for collecting these subjects as ideas of\n ultimacy,[2]\n doing so presupposes they have some shared characteristic or family\nresemblance that makes them count as ultimate. But is there a\nshared core idea of being ultimate? \u201cParticularists\u201d among\nothers argue no: the diverse range of cultural and historical contexts\nfrom which these subjects come, coupled with how hard it is to talk\nacross such contexts, makes them all \u201cseparate cultural\nislands\u201d (Hedges 2014: 206; see also Berthrong 2001:\n237\u2013239,\n 255\u2013256).[3]\n The second concern is related, and not far from one Tomoko Masuzawa\n(2005) among others has raised about religion: even if we found a\nsubstantive account of ultimacy visible in multiple traditions, such\nan account necessarily will be borne from a cultural conceptual\ncontext. Thus, far from delivering the notions at work in other\ntraditions, such an account actually risks de-forming them.\n\nRegarding the first concern, John H. Berthrong, among others, is far\nmore optimistic than the particularists that concepts not only can be\nshared across cultures but in fact are\n\n\nalready comparative, having been generated by the interactions of\npeople, texts, rituals, cultural sensibilities and the vagaries of\nhistory and local customs. (2001: 238)\n\n\nOther theorists explore factors that could detail or add to\nBerthrong\u2019s list\u2014e.g., trade and conquests (Gayatriprana\n2020), shared human evolutionary biology (Wildman 2017), and the\nevolution of moral development (Wright\n 2010).[4]\n Still, most take the second concern about enculturation to stick and\nthus to temper the optimism: there is both a shared humanity\nand real cultural difference to own in reaching a global idea\nof ultimacy. Raimon Panikkar says it well:\n\n\nBrahman is certainly not the one true and living God of the\nAbrahamic traditions. Nor can it be said that Shang-ti or\nkami are the same as brahman. And yet they are not\ntotally unrelated. (Panikkar 1987 [2005: 2254])\n\n\nThe Cross-Cultural Comparative Religious Ideas Project, run by Robert\nC. Neville and Wesley Wildman from 1995\u201399, balanced the overlap\nand difference when they concluded that an account of ultimacy should\nbe a \u201cproperly vague\u201d category: it needs enough shared\ncontent to count as a category, but enough vagueness to cover the\ndisparate instances generally taken to be\n ultimates.[5]\n There are multiple contenders for such vague categories, including,\ne.g., Paul Tillich\u2019s \u201cobject of ultimate concern\u201d\n(1957a, e.g., 10\u201311), John Hick\u2019s \u201cthe Real\u201d\n(1989: 11ff); Keith Ward\u2019s \u201cthe Transcendent\u201d\n(1998); and the Project\u2019s own proposal as \u201cthat which is\nmost important to religious life because of the nature of\nreality\u201d (Neville & Wildman 2001, see 151ff for an\nexplanation of each part of the phrase).\n\nInformed by the Project\u2019s finding, this entry will\n\u201cvague-ify\u201d the content of John Schellenberg\u2019s\naccount of what is ultimate to use as a cross-cultural core idea of\nultimacy and as an organizing principle. To paraphrase, Schellenberg\ntakes being ultimate to mean being that which is (1) the most real,\n(2) the most valuable, and (3) the source of deepest fulfillment among\nall that is or perhaps could be. More carefully, and in\nSchellenberg\u2019s words, being ultimate requires being ultimate in\nthree ways: (1) metaphysically ultimate, i.e., the \u201cmost\nfundamental fact\u201d about the nature of things (2016: 168), (2)\naxiologically ultimate, i.e., that which \u201chas unsurpassably\ngreat value\u201d (2009: 31), meaning greatness along all its\ncategories of being, and (3) soteriologically ultimate, i.e.,\n\u201cthe source of an ultimate good (salvific)\u201d (2009: xii,\nalso 2005: 15), meaning being the source of salvation or liberation of\nthe kind practitioners of the world\u2019s religions and philosophies\nardently seek (e.g., nirvana, communing with God, moksha, ascent to\nthe One, etc.), whether these all amount to the same salvation (e.g.,\nHick 1989: Ch. 14) or constitute radically distinct types of\nsalvations (Heim 1995: Ch. 5). Schellenberg\u2019s choice of these\nthree terms is insightful: most extant takes on ultimacy per\nse and on Brahman, God and the Dao in particular are variations\non a theme of Schellenberg, as scrutiny of even the brief definitions\nabove as well as the models in\n Section 2\n will bear\n out.[6]\n\nSchellenberg\u2019s account of what it takes to be ultimate is\nalready somewhat vague: he recommends no further precisification of\nhis three terms in order to stay open about what counts as ultimate as\nour knowledge grows (2009: 31). This entry will loosen his account\nfurther by placing a disjunction between its terms instead of a\nconjunction. That is, Schellenberg takes metaphysical, axiological and\nsoteriological ultimacy to be severally necessary and jointly\nsufficient for something to count as ultimate; he requires\n\u201ctriple ultimacy\u201d, as James Elliott calls it, for ultimacy\nper se (2017: 103\u201304). Those who agree in principle\ninclude, e.g., Clooney 2001 and Rubenstein\n 2019,[7]\n as well as, e.g., Aquinas, Leibniz and Samuel Clarke, who in fact\nargue that, given the entailments between the terms, there is triple\nultimacy or none at\n all.[8]\n Others take double or even single ultimacy to be not only possible\nbut also sufficient for being ultimate. For example, Neville defines\nultimacy in strictly metaphysical terms as \u201cthe ontological act\nof creation\u201d (2013: 1); Elliott and Paul Draper each take\nsoteriological ultimacy to be sufficient for ultimacy (Elliott 2017:\n105\u2013109; Draper 2019: 161); and John Bacon takes his\nunderstanding of God as \u201c<Creator, Good>\u201d to be\nmetaphysically and soteriologically ultimate though a \u201clet-down\naxiologically\u201d (2013: 548). Moreover, requiring triple ultimacy\nstops some of the paradigmatic models of Brahman, God and the Dao from\ncounting as ultimacy, as\n Section 2\n will demonstrate (see also Diller 2013b). Thus, this entry will take\nsome combinations of the three types of ultimacy to be sufficient for\nbeing ultimate, without settling which, provided nothing else in a\nsystem has more. Note that replacing Schellenberg\u2019s conjunction\nwith a disjunction makes the field of ultimates a family resemblance\nclass.\n\nEven disjunctivized, the Schellenbergian view adopted here is clearly\nan inheritance from Abrahamic perfect being\n theology,[9]\n so two cautions about scope. First, when we look outward and find\nthat some non-Abrahamic traditions have ultimacy in the sense\nhere\u2014as we will in\n Section 2\n for Hinduism and Daoism\u2014we should acknowledge that this result\ncomes framed from the outside. Second, not all non-Abrahamic\ntraditions will have ultimates in the sense just adopted. For\ninstance, to offer just one example, Barbara Mann suggests that in\nnon-colonized interpretations of Native American spiritualities there\nis nothing that is ultimate in Schellenberg\u2019s sense (2010:\n 33\u201336).[10]\n So ultimacy as just defined may be widespread in the world\u2019s\nreligions and spiritualities, but it is not universal.\n\nFinally, three points of clarification about terminology. First,\ntalking about ultimacy does not entail that anything ultimate exists.\nThe concern that it might is related to \u201cthe problem of singular\nnegative existential statements\u201d, to which Frege and Russell\noffered solutions that in turn have been enshrined in predicate logic,\nthough not without complaint (for more see Kripke 2013 and the SEP\narticles on\n existence\n and on\n nonexistent objects).\n Second, the term \u201cultimate reality\u201d could be taken to\nmean how reality ultimately is\u2014i.e., that which is\nmetaphysically ultimate, perhaps a part of every complete\nontology\u2014instead of meaning the richer sense of\n\u201cultimacy\u201d at issue here, which is not a part of every\ncomplete\n ontology.[11]\n To avoid confusion, this entry will reserve the term \u201cultimate\nreality\u201d for metaphysical ultimacy per se and use\n\u201cultimate\u201d and variants for the combinations of the\nSchellenbergian\n disjunction.[12]\n Thus framed, the distinction leaves open this central question: is\nultimate reality ultimate? Lastly, regarding the choice of the term\n\u201cultimate\u201d and its variants, there is a syntactic parallel\nto the semantic issue above: we need a sufficiently vague kind of\nspeech to cover the diverse ontological kinds implicit in accounts of\nultimacy, including concrete or abstract particular things (e.g., God\nor Brahman on some views); states of being (e.g.,\nExistence-Consciousness-Bliss for Brahman, see\n Section 2.1);\n properties (e.g., everything is empty on Buddhism or divinely\nintentional for Karl Pfeifer, see\n Section 2.2);\n actions and events that things perform or undergo (D. Cooper models\nGod as \u201ca verb\u201d as in \u201cGod-ing\u201d, 1997: 70; cf.\nBishop & Perszyk 2017); and grounds of being that are meant to be\ncategory-less (e.g., as in \u201cthe creative source of the\ncategories themselves\u201d, Vallicella 2006 [2019], see also, e.g.,\nTillich in\n Section 2.2,\n the Dao in\n Section 2.3).\n Though no term is quite right given the diversity, this entry uses\nthe adjective form of being \u201cultimate\u201d as primary, to\ndescribe x as metaphysically, axiologically or\nsoteriologically ultimate per above, whatever x\u2019s\nontological kind (cf. with the more familiar term from Abrahamic\nmonotheism of \u201cdivine\u201d). It also uses \u201cultimacy\u201d\nas a noun for the nature or state of being ultimate (cf.\n\u201cdivinity\u201d), the nouns \u201cthe ultimate\u201d, \u201can\nultimate\u201d or \u201cultimates\u201d to function flexibly both as a\nmass noun (such as \u201cwater\u201d or \u201cbutter\u201d) for\nthe property or uncountable substance of being ultimate and as a count\nnoun for things, events and grounds of being (cf. \u201cGod\u201d or\n\u201cgods\u201d); and \u201cto ultimize\u201d as the verb form,\nif ever we need\n it.[13]\n",
