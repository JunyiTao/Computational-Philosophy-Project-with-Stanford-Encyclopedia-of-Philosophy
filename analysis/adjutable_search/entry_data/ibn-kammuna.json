    "preamble": "\n\n\nThe centuries following the remarkable achievement of Ibn Sina\n(Avicenna; d. 1037) were a remarkably creative period in the sciences\nand philosophy. Sa\u2018d ibn Mansur Ibn Kamm\u016bna, a Jew from Baghdad,\nactively participated in the lively discourse of his day. In his\ncopious writings he takes up the entire gamut of philosophical issues\ndiscussed by his contemporaries. Editions, translations and studies of\nworks by Ibn Kamm\u016bna and other thinkers of the time have appeared in\nrecent years. Nonetheless, it remains\ndifficult at this stage to contextualize Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s work, or to\ndecide wherein lies his most noteworthy contribution.\n\nNo topic so engaged Ibn Kamm\u016bna more than the study of the human soul,\nespecially its proper characterization and the proofs for its survival\nafter the death of the body. So, after first surveying Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s\nbiography, writings, and image, we will present Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s views on\nthe soul and its afterlife. Then we shall follow the thread of one\nconcept whose significance for the thought of the age has been firmly\nestablished, namely, h\u0323ads [most usually translated as\n\u201cintuition\u201d], through his major writings. At the very\nleast, this shall afford us a glimpse at the way Ibn Kamm\u016bna handles a\nkey notion of psychology, epistemology, and the theory of prophecy, in\nvarious literary formats. Following that, we will present the\nfirst-ever survey of his religious ethics; the key texts have only\nrecently been published. Finally, we will have a look at some of the\nsophistries and paradoxes that are attributed to him.\n\n\nAll agree that the publication of editions of Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s writings\n(all of which are in Arabic) are a necessary first step in the study\nof his contribution. There is far less agreement as to how to assess\nthe worth of editions, as well as the need or lack thereof for redoing\neditions that are already available. Discussion of these and related\nissues are essential to our topic, and bear upon the proper\nunderstanding of Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s position on the issues of his day. With\nthis in mind, we will end with a short, critical discussion of some\neditions that have appeared, just before the bibliography.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\n\nFew facts of Ibn Kammuna\u2019s biography are confirmed (Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke 2006, 8\u201322, for most biographical details and bibliography). He is\npresumed to have been born in Baghdad and to have spent most of his\nlife there. However, there is good evidence that he spent some time in\nAleppo; his presence in that important intellectual center explains\ncertain facets of his activity that are otherwise difficult to account\nfor (Langermann 2007). He may have been descended from a family of\ncourtiers; he certainly had connections to some high officials, some of\nwhom were his patrons. Ibn Kammuna also corresponded with some leading\nintellectuals, notably Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. Shortly before his death\nin 1284, Ibn Kammuna fled Baghdad for the nearby town of Hilla. This\nmove has long been thought to have been forced upon Ibn Kammuna by\nhostile reaction to one of his books. However, it has recently been\nsuggested that it is more likely to be connected to the execution of\none of his patrons.\n\n\nIbn Kammuna was certainly born into a Jewish family. Though his\nwritings as a rule do not betray his Judaism\u2014if anything, they\nread like the work of a devout, if philosophically inclined,\nMuslim\u2014his two forays into comparative religion exhibit a clear\nbias in favor of rabbinic Judaism. Some subtle polemics are detectable\nin glosses that he wrote to an important work of Islamic\ntheology. (This is discussed in the next section.) On the other hand,\nhis attraction to Sufi-style piety does not betray any influences of\nearlier Jewish ventures in the same direction, notably by the\ndescendants of Maimonides. But did he remain Jewish until his death?\nThe evidence from citations in later writers, who generally refer to\nhim as a Jew, would indicate so.  However, there are\ncounter-indications; one may also take note of numerous pious\nreferences to the Prophet in Ibn Kammuna\u2019s writings, not all of which\ncan easily be ascribed to later scribes. The great bibliographer\nMoritz Steinschneider opined that Ibn Kammuna in fact converted; his\narguments were countered by some of the great pioneers of\nJudaeo-Arabic studies, notably D.H. Baneth. Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke, in their recent book-length study (2006), doubt the story\nof Ibn Kammuna\u2019s conversion.\n2. Writings\n\n\nThe latest studies on Ibn Kammuna have focused mainly on his\npsychology; his writings and doctrines in that field will be discussed\nbelow. Judging in terms of its impact on modern scholarship,\nespecially when one moves beyond the rather narrow confines of\nspecialists in late medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy, as well\nits impact upon his own personal life, Ibn Kammuna\u2019s Tanq\u012bh\u0323\n(Examination of the Three Faiths, English translation by\nPerlmann) is his most important work. The fundamental premise of the\ntreatise, and one that informs other of his writings as well, is that\nthere is a single theory of prophecy that is accepted by Jews,\nChristians, and Muslims alike, and which, moreover, meets the truth\nstandards of philosophy. What remains, then, is to compare the claims\nthat are particular to each of the three faiths. Though\nthe Examination should not be classified as a polemical work,\nas it contains no outright attack on any faith, its pro-Jewish bias is\nquite evident. Ibn Kammuna constructed the Jewish view he presents by\nmeans of a combination of ideas drawn from Maimonides and Judah\nHallevi. While this seems at first to be an odd mismatch of\nauthorities, Ibn Kammuna was not the only Jewish thinker to harmonize\nthe two eminent Andalusians. Christians and Muslims rejected the way\ntheir tenets were presented, and representatives of both penned\nrebuttals (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 106\u2013113). On the other\nhand, no Jewish reaction of any sort to the Examination has\nreached us. It should be added that neither in the\nExamination, nor in any other work, does Ibn Kammuna make any\nunambiguous reference to Buddhism; given the political realities of\nMongol rule (the Mongols had not yet converted to Islam) as well as\nIbn Kammuna\u2019s broad interests, one might have expected him to exhibit\nsome curiosity.\n\n\nIbn Kammuna wrote a much shorter treatise on the differences between\nthe two main Jewish groupings, Rabbinites and Karaites (English\ntranslation by Nemoy). Here again, despite the absence of any open\npolemics, it is clear that Ibn Kammuna\u2019s sympathies lie with the\nRabbinic majority.\n\n\nIbn Kammuna\u2019s most significant contribution to the history of\nphilosophy is his detailed commentary to Suhraward\u012b\u2019s\nal-Talw\u012bh\u0323\u0101t.  (Several editions have appeared and are\ndiscussed in the last section of this entry). This is the first known\ncommentary to that work, which, though more Aristotelian than other\nwritings of Suhraward\u012b, still conveys essential points of the Ishraqi\nphilosophy. Directly through his commentary, and indirectly by means\nof his influence upon Qut\u0323b al-D\u012bn al-Shiraz\u012b (1236\u20131311), Ibn Kammuna\nwas very instrumental in the initial phases of the exposition and\ndiffusion of Suhraward\u012b\u2019s thought.\n\nAl-Jad\u012bd f\u012b \u2018l-h\u0323ikma (The New Wisdom); is a\ncomprehensive exposition of thirteenth century science and\nphilosophy. (For a preliminary study, see Langemann 2005; the titles\nof this book are discussed in the final sections below.)  Numerous\nmanuscript copies exist (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 87\u201392). Ibn\nKammuna experimented with different formats and especially different\nlengths in his philosophical writing. He adhered to the traditional\ntri-partite classification of logic, physics, and metaphysics, in a\nlengthy format (al-Jad\u012bd), a highly condensed version\n(Talkh\u012bs\u0323; see Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 94, for\nbibliography, and an edition of the Arabic text, 196\u2013206), and quite\nlikely a middle length version (Risala f\u012b \u2018l-h\u0323ikma),\nwhose authenticity is still unresolved (Langermann 2005, 279\u2013286).\n\n\nSimilarly, he has left us a medium length pietistic work (Kalimat\nwajiza) and a much shorter version of the same treatise\n(Ithb\u0101t al-mabda\u02be); but he also confides that he may expand\nupon the Kalim\u0101t waj\u012bza (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006,\n140). Even if that plan never came to fruition (no evidence of this\nlonger version has as yet turned up), it indicates his conviction that\nimportant topics ought to be discussed in all three formats, which\npresumably take into consideration the varying abilities of people to\ndevote time to study. The two extant pietistic texts are published\n(with no discussion of the contents) by Pourjavady & Schmidtke\n2006, 139\u2013195. Langermann (2017) has published an annotated\ntranslation of the Ithb\u0101t. These are discussed further below,\nin the penultimate section.\n\n\nIbn Kamm\u016bna wrote glosses to an important work of Islamic theology,\nFakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s al-Ma\u2018\u0101lim (Schmidtke & Pourjavady\n2007). In part this is a supercommentary, that is, a response to an\nearlier set of glosses prepared by his contemporary, Najm al-Din\nal-Katibi al-Qazwini (d. 1277). In some places Ibn Kamm\u016bna defends\nal-Razi against the strictures of al-Katib\u012b al-Qazwin\u012b, but in others\nraises criticisms of his own against al-R\u0101z\u012b. Some of the latter\nbetray upon close reading a subtle anti-Islamic polemic. For example,\nhis long gloss on the first query in chapter seven (Schmidtke &\nPourjavady 2007, 96\u201398) is a critique of the role of miracles in\nestablishing the prophetic mission. Ibn Kamm\u016bna names no prophets,\nconcentrating instead on the precise definition of mu\u2018jiza (the Arabic\nterm for miracle) given by al-R\u0101z\u012b himself in other writings, which\ncontradicts his definition in this particular work; and further\narguing, again on theoretical grounds, that a tradition can be false\n(or at least contain some falsity) even if the transmitters are\nmany. However, in the query under scrutiny, al-R\u0101z\u012b is speaking\nspecifically about Muhammad. Thus Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s critiques amount in\neffect to a rejection of the proofs for Muhammad\u2019s prophetic\nmission. Later on, though, Ibn Kammuna makes specific criticisms of\nJudaism and Christianity (Schmidtke & Pourjavady 2007, 226). The\nglosses are written in a the highly technical language of Islamic\ntheology, which is very different from the philosophical diction he\nuses in other writings. Ibn Kamm\u016bna has clearly mastered both\nidioms. \n \n\nSeveral paradoxes are associated with Ibn Kamm\u016bna, and these continue\nto exercise Iranian thinkers down to the present. These are discussed\nin the final section of this entry.  He has also left us some minor\nwritings and correspondence; some pieces of a medical writings have\nalso been recovered (see Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006 for\nbibliography; medical fragments published, translated, and analyzed in\nLangermann 2007, 14\u201319).\n3. Evaluation and Image in Modern Scholarship\n\n\nIbn Kammuna\u2019s work in psychology attracted the interest of the great\npioneer in Islamic studies, Ignace Goldziher (1896), who devoted a\nshort study to Ibn Kammuna\u2019s arguments for the soul\u2019s\nimmortality. However, Ibn Kammuna\u2019s main claim to fame in the\ntwentieth century was certainly his Examination, which was\nwidely hailed as the first dispassionate, scientific, non-polemical\ncomparative study of its sort.  Henri Corbin\u2019s (1945) 2-volume work in\nFrench opened up the world of Suhrawardi and the Ishraqi philosophers\nfor western scholarship, and signaled Ibn Kammuna\u2019s key role in the\ndiffusion of Suhrawardi\u2019s thought. Nonetheless, we still have no clear\npicture of a distinctive Ibn Kammunian interpretation of Suhrawardi,\nif such a thing exists. His philosophy belongs to the elaboration,\nrefinement, and defense of the Avicennian tradition, led in his day by\nNasir al-Din al-Tusi, with whom he corresponded. On the other hand, he\nevidently accepted some of the criticisms leveled at Avicenna by\nAbu-l-Barakat al-Baghdadi and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. Finally, the\npresent article hopes to add to his intellectual portrait the deep\npiety evident in his ethical treatises, which draw upon Jewish,\nIslamic, and non-denominational philosophic sources.\n4. The Science of the Soul\nThe science of the soul (\u2018ilm al-nafs) is an important topic in all of Ibn\nKammuna\u2019s philosophical treatises.  In addition, he wrote three\nmonographs, two of which aim to prove that the soul is eternal, and a\nthird which refutes the claim that the soul is nothing but the\ntemperament or mixture of the bodily humours, as well as the view that\nthe soul comes into being along with the body.  (Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke 2006, 100\u2013106). His special interest in studying the soul\n(nafs) calls for explanation. Like so many other features of\nhis work, it can be understood only in the context of the Avicennan\nlegacy. Avicenna took his perception of his own self to be the most\ncertain piece of knowledge that he possessed. (It may be noted in\npassing that in Arabic, nafs means both \u201csoul\u201d\nand \u201cself\u201d; though Avicenna took care to be as precise as\npossible in his terminology, this double-entendre has an inevitable\npresence in Arabic psychological literature, especially in the wake of\nAvicenna). This approach is totally at odds with the Aristotelianism\nthat, in all of its flavors, was the foundation of Islamic\nphilosophies. Throughout his life Avicenna struggled with the complex\nof problems ensuing from his insight, especially in the realms of\npsychology and epistemology, without ever arriving at a satisfactory\nsolution. The conundrum reverberated in the work of the following\ngenerations.[1]\n\n\n\nIbn Kammuna took the Avicennan reformulation as his basic conception\nof the soul. In lengthier writings he would of course review the\nfaculties, properties, and so forth associated with the soul; but the\nfundamental notion was that of the individual\u2019s self-awareness. For\nexample, in the introduction to his essay On the Immortality of\nthe Soul, he writes \u201cThe (word) soul is a designation of\nthe essence of the individual, to which one refers when one employs\nthe pronoun \u2018I\u2019 in saying \u2018I have done thus and\nso\u2019, \u2018I have reached such and such\u2019\u201d\n[trans. Nemoy 1958, p. 86]. In his pietistic Brief words\n(Kalim\u0101t waj\u012bza, to be discussed at length later on in this\nessay), Ibn Kammuna complains that a full discussion of the soul\u2019s\nproperties, mode of binding to the body, and so forth, would be\n\u201clengthy\u201d; he is content to refers the reader \u201cto\nbooks by those who have preceded [us]\u201d. For his purposes,\n\u201cthe most important [point] that has been made, and the closest\nto comprehension\u2026is that the soul is that to which each one\nrefers when saying \u2018I\u2019, as in \u2018I perceived\u2019,\n\u2018I did this\u2019\u201d\u2026) (Schmidtke and Pourjavady 2007,\np. 151).\n\n\nNonetheless, Ibn Kammuna parted ways with Avicenna, and with the\nmainstream philosophical tradition, on the key issue of the soul\u2019s\npre-existence. Avicenna denied that the soul existed before the human\nwas born, but Ibn Kammuna held that the soul\u2019s pre-existence is\nintimately connected with its immateriality, and a doctrine that must\nbe accepted in order to prove the soul\u2019s survival after the death of\nthe body. And, indeed, as Lukas Muehlethaler has shown in a series of\npublications, Ibn Kammuna labored to shore up the demonstrations of\npsychological doctrines throughout. In his commentary to Avicenna\u2019s\nIsh\u0101r\u0101t (\u201cPointers\u201d), where the \u201cFlying Man\u201d\nthought experiment is displayed, Ibn Kammuna puts Avicenna\u2019s verbal\nargument into syllogistic form. (Whether the syllogism is productive,\nand, in general, just how well Ibn Kammuna has succeeded in answering\nthe modern critics of Avicenna, remain open questions; see Muhlethaler\n2009 for full discussion). Ibn Kammuna boldly claims to have\nformulated the first demonstrative proof for the soul\u2019s eternity a\nparte ante. Indeed, for Ibn Kammuna the soul is really an intellect (\u2018aql)\nthat is called \u201csoul\u201d when it is associated with a\nparticular body (Muehlethaler 2012).\n5. Philosophy: Following the Thread of Intuition\n5.1 Introduction\n\n\nIbn Kammuna looms as a philosophical writer, a learned and keen\nstudent, who bequeathed to posterity not a \u201cphilosophy\u201d\nbut rather a rich assortment of philosophical studies. Some, such as\nhis New Wisdom, aimed at a synthesis; others, like his\ncommentary to Suhrawardi, are primarily an essay in the interpretation\nof the thought of others; yet others, e.g., the monographs mentioned\nin the preceding section, address specific issues to whose resolution\nIbn Kammuna feels he can contribute. Scholarship on his output,\nhowever, has displayed less interest in literary form, intended\naudience, and specific objectives; instead, in keeping with an\nacademic tradition, it has focused by and large upon the\nidentification of his \u201csources\u201d, even at the level of\nsentence by sentence, or phrase by phrase, analysis. This approach has\nreaped some important insights, for example, the combination of\nAvicennan and Suhrawardian statements in connection with the notion of\nexistence.\n\n\nOne drawback of this approach is the patchwork image it impresses upon\nthe modern student, as if Ibn Kammuna set out to prepare a quiltwork of\nphilosophical sources rather than to take a stand on the issues. But is\nthis the way his writings present themselves to the reader who is\ninnocent of academic scholarship? Ibn Kammuna is aware of the\nquestions that are under debate, and as a rule he formulates a clear\npoint of view.  Nonetheless, his views may well have changed over the\nyears\u2014not at all surprising, if, as some think, he made the more\ntraumatic act of switching religious affiliation. It is in any event\nclear enough that his expressions, emphases, agreements and\ndisagreements, inclusions and exclusions, were in part functions of\nthe literary genre which he chose for any given work. He could be\ncritical in his commentaries, insofar as he would look closely at the\ntext he was explicating and cite alternative views, but he would not\nreject outright the views of the author whose work he was commenting\nupon. In his original writings he was freer to take a personal\nstand.\n\n\nIf we also keep in mind the nascent state of scholarship on the man\nand the period in which he flourished, the best course of action for\nthe present essay seems to be this.  We shall take one very central\nconcept, h\u0323ads, most often translated \u201cintuition\u201d, and\nfollow it through Ibn Kammuna\u2019s major works. (It will become clear\nthat in this context, intuition is a sui generis state, which, on the\nepistemological scale, falls between the discursive reasoning of very\nbright individuals and the gift of prophecy.) This will allow us to\nget a handle on a key feature of his philosophical thinking, as well\nas to observe the different ways the same concept is treated within\nthe different projects that Ibn Kammuna undertook. Note that we shall\nbe alert to the utilization of the concept, even if the\nterm h\u0323ads does not appear in the text under scrutiny.\n\n\nStrictly speaking, h\u0323ads is the revelation\u2014some would add\ninstantaneously\u2014of the middle term of the syllogism, leading to\nan infallible conclusion. In practice, though, it had much wider\napplication and less precise definition. Rare indeed is the case,\nwhen h\u0323ads is cited as the source of knowledge, that the\nwriter will display the full syllogism and specify the middle term\n(see Langermann 2005, 286\u2013302, and Gutas 2001). In effect, it is of\nthe same species as the \u201crevelations\u201d by which Avicenna\nlearned of his own existence (and indeed the great bulk of his\neducation) and, like that Avicennan moment, it shifted epistemology in\nthe direction of a reliance upon a person\u2019s sense of security in his\npersonal illuminations . In the work of later thinkers, including Ibn\nKammuna, the evaluation of h\u0323ads served to legitimize alchemy and\nastrology and, more generally, to blur the distinction between\ndemonstrative knowledge and revelation.\n\nH\u0323ads was not just one more function to be added to the basket\nof terminologies used to explain psychological processes. Two\napplications in particular must be singled out. First of all,\nh\u0323ads offered an analogy to prophecy; no other phenomenon from\nthe world of humans, extraordinary as it may be, seemed as close to\nprophetic revelation. Second, it offered a way to account for great\nscientific acumen. Prophecy, scientific discovery, and intuition in\ngeneral all lead those who experience them to certain knowledge\nin a moment of\nrevelation, in general, knowledge that had not been available before.\n5.2 Examination\n\n\nEarlier attempts to explain the phenomenon of prophecy in terms of the then-accepted workings of the human psyche, for example, that of\nMaimonides, found analogous or proto-prophetic symptoms in two types\nof human inspiration. The first of these includes veridical dreams,\ndivination, and other cases in which the unknown is revealed. The\nsecond comprises instances where people spontaneously perform acts of\nbravery, leadership, or literary creativity, and thus act in a manner\nthat appears to be above the ordinary. These ideas were helpful in\ndeveloping a political theory of prophecy; the prophet, like the\nphilosopher-king, is a visionary, gifted with bold leadership as well\nas the ability to impose a code of behavior upon his people. The main\ndifference is that the code of the prophet is expressly not of his own\ndevise, but rather revealed by some supernal source. On the whole, Ibn\nKammuna downplays the political function of prophecy. The prophet does\nhave an important role to play in organizing and ordering society.\nHowever, the thrust of Ibn Kammuna\u2019s analysis emphasizes the\nepistemological advantages of the prophet rather than his political\nskill. Moreover, as political leader, he is charged with inculcating\ncorrect religious belief; Ibn Kammuna sharply distinguishes between\nthe prophet on the one hand, and rulers of jahiliyya\n(uncultured, lacking a proper revealed code) cities on the other.\n\n\nThe prophet\u2019s distinction from others is to be explained in\npsychological terms by the perfection of his h\u0323ads. In\ndeveloping this theme, Ibn Kammuna makes the bold claim that\nh\u0323ads is the ultimate basis of all human knowledge. All\nknowledge that is acquired is either a direct intuition, acquired by\nsomeone suitably equipped, or instruction in items of knowledge that\nhas been acquired by someone else by intuition:\n\n\nAs for their [prophets\u2019] perfection, it is due to the perfection of\ntheir speculative intellect, and for this reason. The middle term, by\nmeans of which one succeeds in acquiring intelligibles that were\n[hitherto] unknown, is at times obtained by means of h\u0323ads, at\nothers by means of instruction. However, h\u0323ads is the basis of\ninstruction. Things thus trace back without a doubt to intuitions\nwhich the masters [of intuition] arrived at. They then conveyed them\nto students. However, it is possible for someone to have an intuition\non his own; the reasoning gels in his mind without a teacher.\n[Perlmann (ed.) 1971, p. 12; translation by the author]\n\n\nHumans exhibit the full range of endowments, from the dull witted who\nnever intuit, to those who are able to satisfy all or nearly all of\ntheir quests by means of intuition. The variation is seen both in the\nquantity of percepts that are obtained intuitively as well as in the\nspeed of intuitive act. (Nonetheless, it should be added that Ibn\nKammuna places the limit at \u201cthe quickest and shortest\ninstant\u201d; unlike Ibn Sina, for example, he does not claim here\nthat intuition takes no time at all.) It is certainly possible that,\nat the upper bounds of human capacity, one may find an individual\nblessed with \u201can intense purity and an intense connection to the\nsupernal sources\u201d such that he can intuit all or most of what\nhumans are capable of knowing, \u201cnot by means of an uncertain\ntradition, but by means of middle terms and demonstrative\nproofs.\u201d H\u0323ads accounts not only for the quickness and\nindependence of the prophet\u2019s knowledge, but for its certainty as\nwell. It meets the requirements of formal logic, since it supplies the\nmiddle term of the syllogism, and hence is demonstrative.\n5.3 The New Wisdom\n\n\nWe examine first the theoretical discussions (following Langermann\n2005, 286\u2013302). In the chapter dealing with demonstration\n(burhan), Ibn Kammuna lists the seven types of judgment\n(hukm) by means of which one asserts or verifies\n(tasdiq) premises that are to be employed in a syllogism.\nH\u0323adsiyy\u0101t, intuitive judgments, are the last on the list,\nand Ibn Kammuna defines them simply as \u201cwhat the soul judges\nto be certain on the basis of evidence (qara\u2019in) other\nthan that found in the [six] sources (mabadi\u2019) that have\nbeen mentioned above\u201d (al-Kabisi 1982, 196; author\u2019s\ntranslation). Ibn Sina does not include h\u0323adsiyy\u0101t in his\nclassification of premises; Suhraward\u012b does include\nh\u0323adsiyy\u0101t in two of his lists, but neither is identical\nto the one found in al-Jad\u012bd. Despite all of these\ndevelopments, however, Ibn Kammuna supplies here exactly the same\ntime-worn example used by Ibn Sina (and before him by Aristotle), i.e.,\nthe fact that the moon\u2019s light derives from the sun.\n\n\nIn a later section of The New Wisdom Ibn Kammuna reproduces\nalmost word-for-word the final definition of h\u0323ads given by Ibn\nSina in his Pointers (al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t), one of his later\nwritings. He begins by noting that progress from first intelligibles to\nsecondary ones can be either by means of fikr (cogitation or\nreflection) or by h\u0323ads, \u201cin that the middle term\npresents itself to the mind all at once, either as the result of a\nsearch and desire [shawq] for it, without any [corresponding]\nmotion [of the soul], or without any impulse [ishtiyaq] or\nmotion.\u201d Ibn Kammuna continues, \u201cAlong with it, the\nobject of the search [i.e. the conclusion of the syllogism] and that\nwhich it entails present themselves. There is no difference between\nreflection and intuition, other than the presence of motion in\nreflection and its absence in intuition\u201d [ed. 441].\n\n\nIt is not difficult to find numerous examples of the application of\nh\u0323ads in The New Wisdom; it has much harder to see how\nh\u0323ads is to be integrated consistently into a comprehensive\nscientific program. Here follow some items of knowledge that are said\nto derive from h\u0323ads. H\u0323ads indicates to astronomers,\neven where logical necessity does not, that the planets require more\nthan one orb in order to complete their motions [ed. 402]. In the life\nsciences, we know by means of h\u0323ads that irrational animals\ncarry out their biological functions unconsciously [ed. 424]. As for\nmetaphysics and psychology, we conclude by means of h\u0323ads that\nintellect is more perfect than soul [ed. 517], and that bodies (or\ntheir species) are but shadows of spiritual entities [ed. 522].\nH\u0323ads and repeated experience (tajriba) together\nindicate that the body is the only impediment to the soul\u2019s conjunction\nwith the pure forms [ed. 492].\n\n\nThe last example is particularly important because it illustrates\nthe intimate connection between h\u0323ads and tajriba, a\nconnection maintained by Ibn Kammuna (and others) throughout.\nTajriba is the most usual justification for the knowledge\nclaimed by astrologers and alchemists. Hence both h\u0323ads and\ntajriba aim to function as sources for hidden knowledge within\nscientific systems that are based upon (ultimately) Aristotelian logic.\nAlthough it is repeatedly invoked as the source for scientific\nknowledge, h\u0323ads is not a tool of scientific inquiry, but\nrather a way of explaining, post facto, how a thinker hit upon\nthe solution to a difficult problem. As such its function in science is\nvery much the same as its function in explaining religious inspiration\nand prophecy.\n5.4 Commentary to Suhraward\u012b, al-Talw\u012bh\u0323\u0101t\n\n\nThe Ishraqi philosophy of which Shihab al-Din al-Suhraward\u012b (d. 1191)\nis considered the founder, has intuition as the basis of its\nepistemology, at least in\n theory.[2]\nIllumination (ishraq in Arabic), in a\nword, describes the event, which many speakers of English would also\ncall intuition, which yields knowledge swiftly and certainly. Intuition\nplays a major role in al-Talw\u012bh\u0323\u0101t, which is considered to be\none of Suhrawardi\u2019s more peripatetic writings. It is not surprising,\nthen, that Ibn Kammuna frequently mentions intuition in his commentary\nto al-Talw\u012bh\u0323\u0101t. It should be borne in mind, though, that true\nto his role as commentator, Ibn Kammuna will as a rule try to flesh out\nand expand upon Suhrawardi\u2019s intentions, rather than expressly\ndeveloping his own ideas.\n\n\nWe shall limit ourselves here to a few examples drawn from the partial\nedition of this commentary published by H. Ziai and A. Alwishah, which\ncovers part two of al-Talw\u012bh\u0101t and whose subject is natural\nscience or physics. Ibn Kammuna describes in one place quotes\napprovingly Suhrawardi\u2019s account of how greatly people differ in this\nrespect: \u201cPeople differ with regard to\nh\u0323ads. There are the doltish, who have never had any success\nin thinking; and there are those with powerful h\u0323ads. Many of\nthe latter exceed others in quantity and quality; but there is no\nlimit, at which one must perforce stop. It is possible for there to be\nsomeone who perceives by means of h\u0323ads most of the\nintelligibles in a short time and without a teacher; and there is a\n[type of] soul called \u2018holy\u2019 whose capacity is as powerful\nas that of the prophets\u201d (Ziai & Alwishah 2003, 456).\n\n\nOther passages afford us an opportunity to sample how h\u0323ads\nis employed in various scientific, or, as we would judge today, occult\ncontexts. In laying forth an account of some twelve phenomena,\nincluding various optical effects in the atmosphere, thunder,\nlightning, and comets, all of which are produced by \u201cvapors\u201d\noriginating in the earth (much as Aristotle had argued in his\nMeteorology), Ibn Kammuna adds that, conjoined to those\ncauses, h\u0323ads judges that there must be \u201cspiritual\nforces\u201d that are due to celestial configurations (Ziai &\nAlwishah 2003, 254). Animals other than man have a rational soul; this\nties in to the question of metemsomatosis. The reasoning will be\nevident to someone who employs\nh\u0323ads, but not to someone who either willfully shuts off\nh\u0323ads, or was simply not born with that gift (Ziai &\nAlwishah 2003, 346\u20137).\n5.5 Key Issues in the Science of Wisdom (al-Mat\u0323\u0101lib al-Muhimma f\u012b \u2018ilm  al-h\u0323ikma)\n\n\nThis treatise is concise in length but encyclopedic in character. (See\nthe edition by Musawi 2003; see also Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006,\n92\u20133.)  It is divided into seven sections. Here as always logic\nis the first topic to be discussed, but h\u0323ads is not mentioned\nat all in the section on logic. It does however figure in the seventh\nand final section, which deals with psychology. In line with some\ntrends of the time, Ibn Kammuna here ranks \u201cthe science of the\nsoul\u201d as the most sublime of the sciences, because the human\nsoul is analogous to the deity.\n\n\nThe fifth \u201cquery\u201d of the final section focuses upon the\ncognitive capacities of the human soul. These vary from person to\nperson, just as bodily endowments vary. However, at the high end of\nthe spectrum, there exists a human soul whose cognitive ability is for\nall practical purposes unlimited. At this level, human cognition is a\n\u201ctaste\u201d of the divine. Ibn Kammuna explains:\n\n\nOnly someone who has experienced (literally \u201ctasted\u201d) the\ntrue reality of the divine fragrances can represent these things to\nhimself. But from among the souls that do not attain this by means of\ntheir innate disposition, some do [manage to] acquire it, whereas\nothers are not able to acquire anything at all. Whosoever abandons\nbodily excesses, makes the best of necessities, and keeps away from\npeople [by living] in mountaintops and empty spaces, thinking about\nthe fine points of divine wisdom, intensely and purely devoted to Him,\nand at times singing about this in well-known harmonious melodies,\nwith poetic speech, about the greatness of God Most High\u2014he will\nreceive some of the divine pleasures, such that are impossible to\ndescribe, and speech is too restricted to express; that is, if he is\nendowed to accept this path. All of this is known through experience\nto the person who finds it within himself, and by recurrence along\nwith intuition to the one who is endowed (Musawi 2003, p. 85\ntranslation by the author).\n\n\nHere as elsewhere, h\u0323ads is paired to tajriba\n(\u201cexperience\u201d) and is described as an innate gift. Here,\nhowever, Ibn Kammuna adds adds an important point. Those who did not\nreceive the gift of h\u0323ads at birth can get a taste of the\ndivine if they cultivate the Sufi methods of isolation, mediation,\nmusic and prayer.\n5.6 Pietistic writings (Kalim\u0101t waj\u012bza, Ithb\u0101t al-mabda\u2019)\n\n\nThe Arabic originals of these two intimately related treatises were\npublished for the first time by Pourjavady & Schmidtke (2006); an\nannotated translation of the Ithbat was published by\nLangermann (2017).  In these writings, Ibn Kammuna pays far less\nattention to questions of cognition than he does in his other\nwritings. However, here as elsewhere, he takes note of the abilities\nof gifted people to grasp issues that remain recalcitrant to others\nwho are not so endowed. Here again Ibn Kammuna connects this special\nmode of cognition with tajriba, repeated experience. In\naddition, he emphasizes here that the fruits of this special type of\nknowledge can be fully appreciated only by someone who has experienced\nthem. It is thus striking that he does not employ the technical\nterm h\u0323ads in the course of his exposition, or, indeed,\nanywhere at all in these two writings.\n\n\nConsider this passage from the Kalim\u0101t (Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke 2006, 158, author\u2019s translation): \u201cIf, however, a\nweakening of the bodily impediments were to be joined to the strength\nof the soul, whether this [strength] be original [asli, here\nmeaning \u2018inborn\u2019] or acquired, the way the soul is\nstrengthened by practice or the training that is associated with\n\u2018those who know\u2019 [i.e., the Sufis], then the bond is made\nfirm in such a way that the soul will attain many hidden things,\ncopious items of knowledge, and illuminative pleasures, whose true\nnature can be apprehended only by someone who has found them\nhimself.\u201d A few lines down tajriba is mentioned:\n\u201cMany wonderful things of the souls are known by means of\nrepeated experiences (tajarib), repetition, and some form of\nreasoning (qiyas).\u201d\n\nTajriba does appear in the passage just cited, but it is not\nmentioned at all in the shorter pietistic treatise, Ithb\u0101t\nal-mabda\u02be (Establishing the First Principle). On the\nother hand, Ibn Kammuna does employ in the shorter work several\ncognate terms to describe the person who can grasp a certain fact\nimmediately and without the need for lengthy demonstration: dhihn\nsalim (\u201chealthy mind,\u201d Pourjavady & Schmidtke\n2006, 188), dhu fitana (\u201cclever,\u201d Pourjavady\n& Schmidtke 2006, 189), dhu lubb\n(\u201cunderstanding,\u201d Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006,\n189).\n\n\nThe terminological conundrum intensifies when we bring into the\ndiscussion another term, dhawq, literally \u201ctaste\u201d.\nDhawq is a Sufi term and refers to a usually fleeting, intense\nreligious experience, which leaves the adept knowing something more\nthan he knew beforehand. Viewed as a phenomenon of the human mind, it\nis essentially the same thing as intuition. It is used in exactly this\nsense by Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2014significantly, in the monograph on\nthe rational soul considered to be his very last\n work.[3]\nSuhraward\u012b adopted the term\nfor his version of knowledge based upon intuition, h\u0323ikma\ndhawqiyya; in Ibn Kammuna\u2019s New Wisdom, h\u0323ads and\ndhawq are synonymous (Langermann 2005, 300). Yet in the\npietistic writings, where one would expect to find the usual Sufi term,\ndhawq is not employed.\n\n\nThere is little difference between the ideas expressed in these two\ntreatises and those in the other writings. In all cases the basic\nthought is that some people are born with an innate ability to swiftly\narrive at conclusions that are certainly true. There remains the technical\ndistinction, in that h\u0323ads, and h\u0323ads specifically, is\nsaid to disclose the middle term of the syllogism. However, one should\nnot make too much of this. For one matter, even in cases\nwhere h\u0323ads is invoked, we rarely if ever can determine just\nwhat the syllogism is for which h\u0323ads has revealed the middle\nterm. One important exception is the reasoning that leads to the\nmomentous conclusions drawn from the \u201cFlying Man\u201d\nexperiment (see Muehlethaler 2009). Moreover, whether or\nnot h\u0323ads is specifically mentioned, intuition or spontaneous\ncomprehension is paired to tajriba.\n\n\nThe chronology of Ibn Kammuna\u2019s writings will not solve the problem\neither. The Kalimat seems to have been written well after Ibn\nKammuna had already been exposed to the writings of Ibn Sina and\nSuhrawardi, both of whom make much of h\u0323ads, as we have seen\n(Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 8\u201312). We are thus confronted here\nwith the historiographical and methodological question of the weight\nto be given to technical terms as opposed to ideas, a question that\nthe present writer opts to leave open.\n6. Piety and Ethics\n\n\nIbn Kammuna\u2019s writings as a rule deal exclusively with speculative\nmatters. Two recently published treatises, however, give equal weight\nto praxis, in line with the pairing of \u2018ilm and\n\u2019amal (knowledge and practice) that appears in the title of\nthe longer work; this pairing was widespread among Sufis but by no\nmeans limited to them alone. Ibn Kammuna usually identifies the reader\nof these tracts as an \u2018\u0101qil, literally someone who employs\nhis intellect; this too is quite common. Other expressions he uses to\ndescribe his audience are \u201cseeker of perfection\u201d and\n\u201cseeker of salvation (najat) and perfection.\u201d\n\n\nThe speculative philosophy expressed in these writings is in keeping\nwith the views that Ibn Kammuna expresses elsewhere. However, he has\nin mind here a very particular type of \u2018ilm;\n\u201ctrue\u201d \u2018ilm is not, as he tells us, what people\ngenerally think. Rather, it is self-knowledge: knowledge of one\u2019s own\nshortcomings, and of one\u2019s obligations to worship God. Knowledge of\nthis sort is goal directed; it serves to weaken one\u2019s\nconnections or involvement in this world, and to produce a concomitant\nintensification of one\u2019s inclination towards the other world. The\nsections on\n\u2019amal, which urge an ethical program steeped in piety, reveal\na side to Ibn Kammuna that has not been mentioned, let alone\nadequately explored, in the scholarly literature to date. The\nfollowing paragraphs are an attempt to bring to the fore some salient\npoints. We shall offer some suggestions towards contextualization,\nwhich are necessarily tentative and preliminary.\n\n\nThe tension-free concord between reasoned, independently verifiable\nknowledge and knowledge based on revelation and tradition (science and\nfaith, to put it more simply) manifest in these writings is noteworthy.\nIbn Kammuna raises none of the ostensible contradictions that so\ntroubled Ibn Sina, al-Ghazali, and Maimonides. A series of generally\nfacile arguments are given for the existence of God and his attributes.\nIn general, the conception of the deity is informed more by His\ngoodness and bounty than it is by His power and judgment.\n\n\nConsistent with the concerns so prominent in his other writings, Ibn\nKammuna devotes a great deal of space (half of part one of the Kalimat, which deals with \u2018ilm, whose meaning in\nthis text has been described two paragraphs above) to the human soul\n(nafs; the meaning of this term in this text has been given\nabove, section II), its quasi-divine nature, and its survival after\ndeath. His discourse on these issues is philosophical. In the second\npart of this treatise, however, Ibn Kammuna shifts to a Sufi mode of\nexposition. In keeping with Sufi notions, he emphasizes the key,\ncritical role of the qalb, literally \u201cheart\u201d, as\nthe epicenter of human goodness. However, he does not adopt the very\ncommon Sufi opposition of nafs, \u201csoul\u201d, to\nqalb, where the former stands for passions and bad moral\ntraits. Instead, he defines qalb as \u201cthe eye of\nnafs. (\u201dEye\u201c in this context has much the same\nmeaning as it has in the English phrase, \u201dthe eye of the\nstorm\u201c).\u201d\n\n\nBoth treatises display a thorough integration of religious and\nphilosophical ideas and ideals. As Ibn Kammuna writes at the beginning\nof the Kalimat: \u201cThe masters of traditional religions\nand of intellectual tenets agree that salvation and eternal felicity\ndepend upon belief in God, the end of days, and doing good\nworks\u201d (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 142). Elsewhere Ibn\nKammuna speaks of \u201cthe people of wisdom and revelation.\u201d\nThe values and ideas expounded in these two works look to represent a\nconsensus that has been reached by these two groups, who, in different\ncircumstances, were thought to be very much at odds with one\nanother. We cannot say as yet how widespread this concordance was as a\nsocial phenomenon. In any event, it was shattered a century later by\nIbn Taymiyya and his followers, who assaulted the\n\u201cforeign\u201d sciences from different angles.\n\n\u2019Amal is definitely subordinate to \u2018ilm; in this\nsense, the pietistic treatises continue the strong scientific\norientation evident in all of Ibn Kammuna\u2019s writings. However, praxis\nis by no means a concession to the low intellectual level of the\nmasses, as it is often thought to be in \u201cpolitical\u201d\nconceptions of religion; nor is it merely a device to restrain bodily\ndrives. Praxis and science reinforce each other in a specific way:\n\u201cFrom the states of the limbs, lights ascend forth to the\nqalb, just as from the gnoses (ma\u2018arif) of the\nqalb, lights descend to the limbs. This is the secret of the\nelevation of souls by means of bodily devotions\u201d (Pourjavady\n& Schmidtke 2006, 161). There is thus a distinct and immediate\nspiritual reward for praxis, even for\u2014perhaps especially\nfor\u2014the enlightened.\n\n\nThe Kalimat is dedicated to a Muslim patron, and it easily\nand naturally reads as a work of Muslim piety. However, on close\ninspection, there is nothing distinctly Muslim about it. Ibn Kammuna\nis driven by the same idea of spirituality and religiosity common to\nMuslims, Jews, Christians, or non-denominational philosophic theists\nof the type described by Judah Hallevi in his Kuzari, a book that Ibn\nKammuna studied closely. It is striking that the only Qur\u2019anic verse\ncited, from the fifty-seventh sura (\u201cIron\u201d, verse\n3) has, at least for its first part (\u201cHe is the first and the\nlast\u2026\u201d), an exact parallel in both the Hebrew and\nChristian bibles.\n\n\nJust how much Jewish ethics, biblical, rabbinic, and medieval, Ibn\nKammuna has included is difficult to determine. Jewish and Islamic\nethics have been intertwined all along; by the thirteenth century, some\nrabbinic ideas had become thoroughly islamicized on the one hand, and,\non the other, Jewish versions of Sufism were well-established. Jews\ncited snippets of the Qur\u2019an as apothegms of universal wisdom, rather\nthan as the scripture of a particular faith\n community.[4] So\nwhen Ibn Kammuna says that \u201cThe beginning (ra\u2019s,\ncf. Hebrew reishit) of wisdom is fear of God,\u201d is he\nconsciously importing the verse from Psalms 111:10? Overall, Ibn\nKammuna appears to have formulated an original \u201cAbrahamic\u201d\nphilosophical piety. Both the philosophical foundations underpinnings\n(concepts of the deity and of humanity) as well as the moral values\nand spiritual exercises, were carefully crafted so as to be acceptable\nto all monotheists .\n7. Shubah\u0101t: Paradoxes, Problems, and Sophistries\n\n\n A number of \u201cproblems\u201d (shubuh\u0101t; the Arabic\nrefers to all forms of obscurities, including what we call paradoxes\nand sophistries) are attributed to Ibn Kammuna. These have challenged\nIranian philosophers in particular from the sixteenth century onwards\n(Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 37\u201351). Some but not all can be\ntraced to known writings of Ibn Kammuna. One of these is the famous\nliar paradox, which Ibn Kammuna discusses in The New Wisdom;\nsome later figures mistakenly thought that Ibn Kammuna had invented\nit. Another, much discussed item is \u201cthe problem of unity\u201d\n(shubhat al-tawh\u0323\u012bd). Especially since Ibn Sina, the deity was\nwidely identified with w\u0101jib al-wuj\u016bd, \u201cthat whose\nexistence is necessary\u201d; but, as a philosophical category, is\n\u201cnecessary existence\u201d necessarily unique?  Muslim and\nJewish thinkers would certainly want it to be so, but proving this\npoint was no simple matter. At one place Ibn Kammuna argues from the\ninterconnectedness of all reality, which implies that a single\n\u201cnecessary existence\u201d must stand at the top of the causal\nchain.  He may have picked this up from Maimonides who noted in his\nGuide of the Perplexed (Part I, Ch. 72) that the unity of\nreality is an important indication for the unity of God. Elsewhere,\nhowever, he chose a more torturous route. Were there more than one\n\u201cnecessary existence\u201d, then, rather than being a unique\nessential characteristic, \u201cnecessary existence\u201d would\nperforce be demoted to the rank of an accident shared by two or more\nbeings. It was this proposal that was debated and criticized by later\nthinkers.\n\n\nAnother \u201cproblem\u201d is a sophistry that ties in with some\nrecondite issues in logic that exercised Ibn Kammuna and his\ncontemporaries, especially conversion by contraposition (Langermann\n2007, 11\u201313). It appears that Ibn Kammuna tried to manipulate the\nsimple observation that creation (h\u0323ud\u016bth al-\u2018alam) is not\ncounterfactual, that is to say, it does not require one to deny\nimmediate reality (al-waqi\u2019, reality or actuality as it\npresents itself here and now), into a formal proof: creation does not\nnecessitate the denial of immediate reality; whatever does not\nnecessitate the denial of immediate reality is immediately real; ergo,\nthe creation of the world is immediately real.\n\n\nIbn Kammuna communicated this \u201cproof\u201d to Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, who\nproceeded to uncover its\n fallacies.[5]\nFor example, the contraposed major premise,\n\u201cwhatever does not necessitate the denial of immediate reality is\nimmediately real,\u201d when written in its positive formulation, requires a\nrider: \u201cWhatever is absent from immediate reality (ghayr\nwaqi\u2019, grammatically a positive sentence in Arabic) necessitates\nthe negation of immediate reality, as long as it remains absent from\nimmediate reality.\u201d The rider, however, makes the premise hypothetical,\nand that, in turn, changes the rules as far as conversion is concerned,\nand does not allow the conclusion Ibn Kammuna wishes to draw.\n8. Recent Editions\n\nIt is a common complaint in the field of Islamic philosophy,\nespecially in its post-Avicennan phases, that we lack editions of\nprimary texts; this complaint was voiced in the first version of this\nentry. In the intervening years, not a few editions of writings by Ibn\nKammuna have appeared. Two key texts have been reissued in the\noriginal. Dr Lwiis Saliba has reissued the Tanq\u012bh\u0323 al-Abh\u0323\u0101th\n(Examination the Three Faiths, published by Byblion, in\nByblos, Lebanon 2009; a second printing was made already in 2010) in a\nvolume of nearly 600 pages, provided with a detailed introduction and\ncopious notes, all in Arabic, but with a very good command of academic\npublications in European languages. Simon Bellahsen has published a\nFrench translation of the Examination, including a\ntranslation of portions from the biography in Pourjavady and Schmidtke\n2006: Examen de la critique des trois religions monoth\u00e9istes,\nParis: Vrin, 2012. H.J. Isfahani published a new edition of\nthe New Wisdom, which he chose to give an alternative title,\nKit\u0101b al-K\u0101shif (The Revealor), published jointly by\nthe Iranian Institute of Philosophy and the Institute of Islamic\nStudies of the Free University of Berlin, Tehran 2008.\n\n\n\nOnly a very small portion of the commentary to\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Talwihat was published by Ziai and Alwishah. Now\ntwo editions of the full text have been prepared: a three volume\ndoctoral dissertation by Sayyid H.S. Musawi (Tehran University, 1385\nSolar, 1996/1997) and a three volume publication by N. Habibi (Tehran\n1387 Solar, 2008/2009.) Joep Lameer scoured all three editions and\npublished a thirty page review (2012). He concludes that we are still\nin need of a reliable edition.\n\n\nThese are welcome developments, to be sure, but there is cause for\nfurther reflection. In particular, the arguments advanced by Ibn\nKammuna have as a rule not been taken into account by the editors, who\nmust decide between variants in the manuscripts, or by the critics who\nreview the editions. Simply taking note of variants missed by one or\nmore editor, even if these seem to be significant, is not enough; we\nwould like to see a discussion of sample passages, with full analysis\nof the implications of the different readings. At times there is no\ngrammatical, syntactical, or lexical reason a priori to choose one\nvariant over the other. Without fully understanding the passage in\nquestion, errors may ensue; an example of this given by Langermann\n2009, p. 282. Earlier editions must not be dismissed as worthless\nunless one can provide examples to prove such an extreme\nclaim. Moreover, changing the title of a book in mid-course without\nany justification (all agree, for example, that Ibn Kammuna himself\ngave no title to the work commonly referred to as the New\nWisdom) introduces confusion with no compensatory payoff. \n",
