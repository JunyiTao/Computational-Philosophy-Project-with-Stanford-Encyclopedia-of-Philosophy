States of affairs, infons, and information content\n\nLater developments in situation semantics emphasized its role as a\ngeneral theory of information content. The key concept is the notion\nof a state-of-affair or \u201cinfon\u201d (see the entry\n states of affairs).\n State-of-affairs are non-linguistic formal objects that come in\nvarious stages of complexity (see Gawron & Peters 1990 for a brief\noverview, Devlin 1991, 2006 for a more detailed exposition, and\nGinzburg & Sag 2000 for a system based on a richer ontology). The\nsimplest kinds of state-of-affairs consist of a relation, individuals\nrelated by the relation, and a polarity, and might be represented as\nin (8):\n\n(8)\n\n\na.\n<< bothering, Nina, Stella; no >>\nb.\n<< helping, Stella, Nina; yes >>\n \n\n\nArguments of a relation may be parameterized, as in (9):\n\n(9)\n<< bothering, x, Stella; no >>\n\n\nParameterized roles can be anchored to individuals. In (9), the\nparameterized botherer role may be anchored to Nina, for example, and\nin that case, the result is the unparameterized state-of-affairs in\n8(a). Parameterized states-of-affairs can be restricted by other\nparameterized state-of-affairs, as in (10), where the subject role for\nthe property of taking a shower is restricted to individuals who are\nsinging:\n\n(10)\n<< showering, x << singing, x;\nyes >>; no >>\n\n\nProperties and relations can be produced from parameterized\nstates-of-affairs by absorbing parameters:\n\n(11)\n[ x | << bothering, x, Stella; no\n>>]\n\n\nParameter absorption is the situation theory analogue of\n\u03bb-abstraction. (11) corresponds to the property of not\nbothering Stella. There are additional operations that build complex\nstates-of-affairs from simpler ones, including analogues of\nconjunction, disjunction, and existential and universal quantification\n(see Devlin 1991, 2006, and Ginzburg & Sag 2000). The ultimate\ngoal is to provide the necessary tools for a theory of information\ncontent (see the entry\n semantic conceptions of information).\n Barwise 1988 mentions a wide range of applications, including\n\u201ca theory of information to account for the role information\npickup plays in the life of the frog, how the information it detects\nis related to the actions it takes, actions like flicking its tongue\nand hopping about\u201d (Barwise 1988, 257). Other applications\nmentioned are theories of vision, databases, robot design,\nmathematical proofs, information exchange between speakers of\nparticular language, and cognitive science as a whole. Finally, the\ntheory should be able \u201cto be turned on itself, and provide an\naccount of its own information content, or rather, of the statements\nmade by the theorist using the theory\u201d (Barwise 1988, 258).\n\nWhen Barwise and Perry started their joint work, a new, more\nfine-grained, notion of information content seemed to be urgently\nneeded in natural language semantics, because of a known challenge\nfacing possible worlds semantics, which, under the influence of Lewis\n1972 and Montague 1974, was the framework of choice for most formal\nsemanticists at the time (see the entry on\n possible worlds).\n In possible worlds semantics, propositions are identified with the\nset of possible worlds where they are true (see the entry\n propositions).\n Consequently, propositions that are true in the same possible worlds\nare identical, and we seem to predict wrongly that a person who\nbelieves a proposition p should also believe any proposition\nthat is true in the same worlds as p (see the entry\n propositional attitude reports).\n To distinguish logically equivalent propositions, we seem to need a\nmore fine-grained notion of what the information content of a sentence\nis, and the state-of-affairs or infons of situation semantics were\nmarketed to provide just that.\n\nThe solution that situation semantics offered for the puzzle of\nlogically equivalents in attitude ascriptions encountered competition\nfrom the very start: state-of-affairs and infons looked suspiciously\nlike structured propositions (see the entry\n structured propositions).\n Intensional versions of structured propositions had already been\noffered as remedies for the attitude ascription problem by Carnap\n1947, Lewis 1972, Cresswell & von Stechow 1982, and were also\nappealed to for the analysis of information structure and intonational\nmeaning. The structured meanings of Carnap, Lewis, and Cresswell &\nvon Stechow are tree structures whose end nodes are intensions, rather\nthan lexical items. They are thus objects that are independent of the\nvocabularies of particular languages, but are nevertheless\nhierarchically structured in the way sentences are. Differences\nbetween structured propositions in various frameworks and the\nstate-of-affairs or infons of situation theory seem to largely boil\ndown to foundational matters regarding the status of possibilia (see\nthe entries on\n possible objects\n and possible worlds) and\nthe nature of properties and relations (see\n properties).\n\nThere is currently no consensus about the semantics of attitude\nascriptions, and it is not clear whether situation semantics has a\nprivileged place in the family of accounts that have been proposed.\nPerhaps more importantly, for most empirical generalizations in\nlinguistic semantics, propositions construed as sets of possible\nworlds or situations provide the right level of abstraction. There\nseems to be no need to posit unwieldy information contents in areas\nwhere simpler notions provide more elegant accounts. Since this\narticle is not about theories of information, the concern to provide a\ngeneral theory of information content will now have to be set aside,\neven though it is central to some areas in situation semantics and\nsituation theory (Devlin 1991, 2006; Ginzburg and Sag 2000; see also\nBarwise & Seligman 1997). The remainder of this article will\nreview situation-based accounts of selected topics that are currently\nunder active investigation in linguistics and philosophy: Austinian\ntopic situations, domain restrictions, donkey sentences, exhaustive\ninterpretations, and Davidsonian event predication. None of those\nphenomena requires a more fine-grained notion of information content.\nThe discussion will thus be cast within a possibilistic framework\n(Kratzer 1989, 2002, 2012; Elbourne 2005, 2013). Possibilistic\nversions of situation semantics are conservative extensions of\npossible worlds semantics that construe propositions as sets of world\nparts, rather than complete possible worlds (see Barwise 1988, chapter\n11, for an overview of the major branch points in situation\nsemantics). There are many areas that situation semantics has\ncontributed to that could not be reviewed here for reasons of space,\nincluding knowledge ascriptions, questions, discourse relations,\ncounterfactuals, viewpoint aspect, gerunds, and implicit arguments.\nStojanovich 2012 and Zucchi 2015 are recent general overviews of\nsituation semantics. Additional references to work on various\nphenomena within a situation-based semantics are given below under the\nheading references not mentioned in the text.\n",
