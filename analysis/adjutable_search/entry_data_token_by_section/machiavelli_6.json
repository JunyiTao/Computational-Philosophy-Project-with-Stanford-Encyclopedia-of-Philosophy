Popular Liberty and Popular Speech\n\nMachiavelli evinces particular confidence in the capacity of the\npeople to contribute to the promotion of communal liberty. In the\nDiscourses, he ascribes to the masses a quite extensive\ncompetence to judge and act for the public good in various settings,\nexplicitly contrasting the \u201cprudence and stability\u201d of\nordinary citizens with the unsound discretion of the prince. Simply\nstated, \u201cA people is more prudent, more stable, and of better\njudgment than a prince\u201d (Discourses CW 316). This is\nnot an arbitrary expression of personal preference on\nMachiavelli\u2019s part. He maintains that the people are more\nconcerned about, and more willing to defend, liberty than either\nprinces or nobles (Discourses CW 204\u2013205). Where the\nlatter confuse their liberty with their ability to dominate and\ncontrol the popolo, the masses are more concerned with\nprotecting themselves against oppression and consider themselves\n\u201cfree\u201d when they are not abused by the more powerful or\nthreatened with such abuse (Discourses CW 203). In turn, when\nthey fear the onset of such oppression, ordinary citizens are more\ninclined to object and to defend the common liberty. Such an active\nrole for the people, while necessary for the maintenance of vital\npublic liberty, is fundamentally antithetical to the hierarchical\nstructure of subordination-and-rule on which monarchic vivere\nsicuro rests. The preconditions of vivere\nlibero simply do not favor the security that is the aim of\nconstitutional monarchy.\n\nOne of the main reasons that security and liberty remain, in the end,\nincompatible for Machiavelli\u2014and that the latter is to be\npreferred\u2014may surely be traced to the \u201crhetorical\u201d\ncharacter of his republicanism. Machiavelli clearly views speech as\nthe method most appropriate to the resolution of conflict in the\nrepublican public sphere; throughout the Discourses, debate\nis elevated as the best means for the people to determine the wisest\ncourse of action and the most qualified leaders. The tradition of\nclassical rhetoric, with which he was evidently familiar, directly\nassociated public speaking with contention: the proper application of\nspeech in the realms of forensic and deliberative genres of rhetoric\nis an adversarial setting, with each speaker seeking to convince his\naudience of the validity of his own position and the unworthiness of\nhis opponents\u2019. This theme was taken up, in turn, by late\nmedieval Italian practitioners and theorists of rhetoric, who\nemphasized that the subject matter of the art was lite\n(conflict). Thus, Machiavelli\u2019s insistence upon contention as a\nprerequisite of liberty also reflects his rhetorical predilections\n(Viroli 1998). By contrast, monarchic regimes\u2014even the most\nsecure monarchies such as France\u2014exclude or limit public\ndiscourse, thereby placing themselves at a distinct disadvantage. It\nis far easier to convince a single ruler to undertake a disastrous or\nill-conceived course of action than a multitude of people. The\napparent \u201ctumult\u201d induced by the uncertain liberty of\npublic discussion eventually renders more likely a decision conducive\nto the common good than does the closed conversation of the royal\ncourt.\n\nThis connects to the claim in the Discourses that the popular\nelements within the community form the best safeguard of civic liberty\nas well as the most reliable source of decision-making about the\npublic good. Machiavelli\u2019s praise for the role of the people in\nsecuring the republic is supported by his confidence in the generally\nilluminating effects of public speech upon the citizen body. Near the\nbeginning of the first Discourses, he notes that some may\nobject to the extensive freedom enjoyed by the Roman people to\nassemble, to protest, and to veto laws and policies. But he responds\nthat the Romans were able to\n\nmaintain liberty and order because of the people\u2019s ability to\ndiscern the common good when it was shown to them. At times when\nordinary Roman citizens wrongly supposed that a law or institution was\ndesigned to oppress them, they could be persuaded that their beliefs\nare mistaken \u2026 [through] the remedy of assemblies, in which\nsome man of influence gets up and makes a speech showing them how they\nare deceiving themselves. And as Tully says, the people, although they\nmay be ignorant, can grasp the truth, and yield easily when told what\nis true by a trustworthy man (Discourses CW 203).\n\n\nThe reference to Tully, that is, Cicero (one of the few in the\nDiscourses) confirms that Machiavelli has in mind here a key\nfeature of classical republicanism: the competence of the people to\nrespond to and support the words of the gifted orator when he speaks\ntruly about the public welfare.\n\nMachiavelli returns to this theme and treats it more extensively at\nthe end of the first Discourse. In a chapter intended to\ndemonstrate the superiority of popular over princely government, he\nargues that the people are well ordered, and hence \u201cprudent,\nstable and grateful\u201d, so long as room is made for public speech\nand deliberation within the community. Citing the formula vox\npopuli, vox dei, Machiavelli insists that\n\npublic opinion is remarkably accurate in its prognostications\u2026.\nWith regard to its judgment, when two speakers of equal skill are\nheard advocating different alternatives, very rarely does one find the\npeople failing to adopt the better view or incapable of appreciating\nthe truth of what it hears (Discourses CW 316).\n\n\nNot only are the people competent to discern the best course of action\nwhen orators lay out competing plans, but they are in fact better\nqualified to make decisions, in Machiavelli\u2019s view, than are\nprinces. For example,\n\nthe people can never be persuaded that it is good to appoint to an\noffice a man of infamous or corrupt habits, whereas a prince may\neasily and in a vast variety of ways be persuaded to do this.\n(Discourses CW 316)\n\n\nLikewise, should the people depart from the law-abiding path, they may\nreadily be convinced to restore order:\n\nFor an uncontrolled and tumultuous people can be spoken to by a good\nman and easily led back into a good way. But no one can speak to a\nwicked prince, and the only remedy is steel\u2026. To cure the\nmalady of the people words are enough. (Discourses CW 317)\n\n\nThe contrast Machiavelli draws is stark. The republic governed by\nwords and persuasion\u2014in sum, ruled by public speech\u2014is\nalmost sure to realize the common good of its citizens; and even\nshould it err, recourse is always open to further discourse.\nNon-republican regimes, because they exclude or limit discursive\npractices, ultimately rest upon coercive domination and can only be\ncorrected by violent means.\n",
