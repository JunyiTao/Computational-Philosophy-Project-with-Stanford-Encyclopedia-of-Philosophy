G\u00f6del\u2019s justification\nof this belief rests partly on an inductive generalization from the\nperfection and beauty of mathematics:\n\nRationalism is connected with Platonism because it is directed to the\nconceptual aspect rather than toward the (real) world. One uses\ninductive evidence\u2026Mathematics has a form of\nperfection\u2026We may expect that the conceptual world is perfect,\nand, furthermore, that objective reality is beautiful, good, and\nperfect. (Wang 1996, 9.4.18)\n\n\nOur total reality and total experience are beautiful and\nmeaningful\u2014this is also a Leibnizian thought. We should judge\nreality by the little which we truly know of it. Since that part which\nconceptually we know fully turns out to be so beautiful, the real\nworld of which we know so little should also be beautiful.\n(9.4.20)\n\n\nAlthough the roots of G\u00f6del\u2019s belief in rationalism are\nmetaphysical in nature, his long-standing aspirations in that domain\nhad always been practical ones. Namely, to develop exact methods in\nphilosophy; to transform it into an exact science, or strenge\nWissenschaft, to use Husserl\u2019s term.\n\nWhat this means in practice is taking the strictest view possible of\nwhat constitutes the dialectical grounds for the acceptance\nof an assertion; put another way, a level of rigor is aspired to in\nphilosophical arguments approaching that which is found in\nmathematical proofs. A formulation of the view\u2014one which is\nsomewhat phenomenologically colored (see below)\u2014can be found in\na document in the G\u00f6del Nachlass. This is a fourteen item list\nG\u00f6del drew up in about 1960, entitled \u201cMy Philosophical\nViewpoint.\u201d Two items on the list are relevant here:\n\nThere are systematic methods for the solution of all problems\n(also art, etc.).\n\n\nThere is a scientific (exact) philosophy and theology, which deals\nwith concepts of the highest abstractness; and this is also most\nhighly fruitful for science.\n\n\n(The list was transcribed by Cheryl Dawson and was published in\nWang 1996, p. 316.)\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s earlier conception of rationalism refers to\nmathematical rigor and includes the concept of having a genuine proof,\nand is therefore in some sense a more radical one than that to which\nhe would later subscribe. One can see it at work at the end of the\nGibbs lecture, after a sequence of arguments in favor of realism are\ngiven:\n\nOf course I do not claim that the foregoing considerations amount to a\nreal proof of this view about the nature of mathematics. The most I\ncould assert would be to have disproved the nominalistic view, which\nconsiders mathematics to consist solely in syntactical conventions and\ntheir consequences. Moreover, I have adduced some strong arguments\nagainst the more general view that mathematics is our own creation.\nThere are, however, other alternatives to Platonism, in particular\npsychologism and Aristotelian realism. In order to establish Platonic\nrealism, these theories would have to be disproved one after the\nother, and then it would have to be shown that they exhaust all\npossibilities. I am not in a position to do this now; however I would\nlike to give some indications along these lines. (G\u00f6del 1995, p.\n321\u20132).\n\n\n(For a penetrating analysis of this passage see Tait 2001.) Such an\nanalysis must be based on conceptual analysis:\n\nI am under the impression that after sufficient clarification of the\nconcepts in question it will be possible to conduct these discussions\nwith mathematical rigour and that the result will then be\u2026that\nthe Platonistic view is the only one tenable. (G\u00f6del 1995, p.\n322).\n\n\nAlong with the methodological component, as can be seen from the items\non G\u00f6del\u2019s list, there was also an \u201coptimistic\u201d\ncomponent to G\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism: once the appropriate\nmethods have been developed, philosophical problems such as, for\nexample, those in ethics (e.g., item 9 on the list is: \u201cFormal\nrights comprise a real science.\u201d) can be decisively solved. As\nfor mathematical assertions, such as the Continuum Hypothesis in set\ntheory, once conceptual analysis has been carried out in the right\nway, that is, once the basic concepts, such as that of\n\u201cset,\u201d have been completely clarified, the Continuum\nHypothesis should be able to be decided.\n\nAlthough at the time of the Gibbs lecture the analogy in\nG\u00f6del\u2019s mind between philosophical and mathematical\nreasoning may have been a very close one, G\u00f6del\u2019s view at\nother periods was that the envisaged methods will not be mathematical\nin nature. What was wanted was a general, informal science of\nconceptual analysis.\n\nPhilosophy is more general than science. Already the theory of\nconcepts is more general than mathematics\u2026True philosophy is\nprecise but not specialized.\n\n\nPerhaps the reason why no progress is made in mathematics (and there\nare so many unsolved problems), is that one confines oneself to the\next[ensional]\u2014thence also the feeling of disappointment in the\ncase of many theories, e.g., propositional logic and formalisation\naltogether. (Wang 1996, 9.3.20,\n 9.3.21)[22]\n\n\n(See notebook Max IV, p. 198 (G\u00f6del Nachla\u00df, Firestone\nLibrary, Princeton, item 030090). Transcription Cheryl Dawson;\ntranslation from the German ours; amendment ours. G\u00f6del\u2019s\ndating of Max IV indicates that it is from May 1941 to April 1942. See\nalso G\u00f6del\u2019s letter to Bernays, G\u00f6del 2003a, p.\n283.)\n\nAn important source for understanding G\u00f6del\u2019s advance\ntoward a general theory of concepts are G\u00f6del\u2019s remarks on\nconceptual analysis published by Hao Wang in Logical Journey.\nIn remark 8.6.10 for example, G\u00f6del expresses the belief that\nextensionality fails for concepts, contrary to what he said in his\n1944 \u201cRussell\u2019s Mathematical Logic,\u201d a remark which\nhe now wishes to retract:\n\nI do not (no longer) believe that generally sameness of range is\nsufficient to exclude the distinctness of two concepts.\n\n\nIn some of G\u00f6del\u2019s later discussions another component of\nconceptual analysis emerges, namely the project of finding the\nso-called primitive terms or concepts, and their relations. These are\nroughly terms or concepts which comprise a theoretical \u201cstarting\npoint,\u201d on the basis of their meaning being completely definite\nand clear. For example, the concept of \u201cthe application of a\nconcept to another concept\u201d is a primitive term, along with\n\u201cforce\u201d. (Wang 1996, 9.1.29).\n\nHe spoke to Wang about the general project in 1972:\n\nPhenomenology is not the only approach. Another approach is to find a\nlist of the main categories (e.g., causation, substance, action) and\ntheir interrelations, which, however, are to be arrived at\nphenomenologically. The task must be done in the right manner. (Wang\n1996, 5.3.7).\n\n\nG\u00f6del spoke with Sue Toledo between 1972 and 1975 about the\nproject of finding primitive terms, as well as other aspects of\nphenomenology. See Toledo 2011. We discuss G\u00f6del\u2019s\ninvolvement with phenomenology further in the supplementary document\n G\u00f6del\u2019s Turn to Phenomenology.\n\nThe judgement levied upon G\u00f6del\u2019s rationalism by\ncontemporary philosophers was a harsh one. (See for example G\u00f6del\n1995, pp. 303\u20134). Nevertheless G\u00f6del himself remained\noptimistic. As he commented to Wang:\n\nIt is not appropriate to say that philosophy as rigorous science is\nnot realizable in the foreseeable future. Time is not the main factor;\nit can happen anytime when the right idea appears. (Wang 1996,\n4.3.14).\n\n\nG\u00f6del concluded his 1944 on a similarly optimistic note.\n",
