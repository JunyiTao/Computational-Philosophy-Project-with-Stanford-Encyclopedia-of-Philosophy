    "main_text": "Ethics || Altruism\n2.6 Altruism\n\nAccording to Rand, there is only one alternative to being rationally\nself-interested: sacrificing one\u2019s proper interests, either for\nthe sake of other people (which she equates with altruism) or for the\nsake of the supernatural (which she calls mysticism) (1982a:\nch. 7). \u201cThe basic principle of altruism\u201d, she argues,\n\u201cis that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that\nservice to others is the only justification of his existence, and that\nself-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value\u201d\n(\u201cFaith and Force,\u201d PWNI 61).  Kant\u2019s ethics is a secularized\nmysticism insofar as it rests on categorical commands and duty for\nduty\u2019s sake, which is to say: regardless of any earthly desire\nor interest (1970). An altruistic ethics equates right action with\nself-sacrifice for the sake of others\u2019 good and immorality with\n\u201cselfishness\u201d, while saying nothing about the standard of\nthe good (\u201cIntroduction\u201d, 1964a: iii; 1974). It thus fails\nto answer the prior question of what code of values we should follow\nand why, and provides no motivation to be moral other than guilt over\n\u201cselfishness\u201d. When taken to its logical conclusion,\naltruism does not simply tell us that it is \u201cselfish\u201d to\npursue our own desires, but also that it is \u201cselfish to\nuphold\u2026 [our own] convictions, \u2026 [that we] must\nsacrifice them to the convictions of others\u201d (Rand 1957 [1992]:\n943; Galt\u2019s Speech, Rand 1961a: 142). In foreign policy,\naltruism is used to justify and gain support for America\u2019s\nintervention in other countries (1966a). Altruism is also the reason\nwhy so many sympathize with, or even praise, bloody dictatorships that\nproudly proclaim that the sacrifice of the individual is a necessary\nand noble means to the goal of the collective good (Rand 1966a).\n\nAs a moral code, altruism is impractical, because its requirements are\ncontrary to the requirements of life and happiness, both the\nagent\u2019s and other people\u2019s. As such, it is also profoundly\nimmoral. Altruism leaves us without any moral guidance in our everyday\nlives and gives morality a bad name.\n\nWhat, then, is the psychological explanation for the widespread\nequation of altruism with morality? Rand suggests various explanations\nreminiscent of Nietzsche\u2019s analysis of the psychology of\naltruism. The theorists and preachers of altruism are motivated\nlargely by a desire to control and manipulate others by playing on\ntheir guilt. Those who accept their teachings typically do so either\nbecause of guilt over their own superior achievements, or because,\nlacking any \u201cintellectual integrity, love of truth\u2026or a\npassionate dedication to an idea\u201d, they have nothing much worth\nsaving, and so do not mind sacrificing themselves (\u201cSelfishness\nWithout a Self\u201d, 1973b; 1982a). Some altruists are altruists\nbecause their mentalities are still frozen in a tribal past when\nsurvival required the sacrifice of some for the sake of others\n(1973b). Rand herself rejects a zero-sum picture of human\nrelationships, so long as everyone in the relationship acts\nrationally.\n\nRand\u2019s defense of \u201cselfishness\u201d (rational\nself-interest) and rejection of altruism (living for others\u2019\nsake) are part of the reason both for her popularity with the general\nreader, and her unpopularity with philosophers and other\nintellectuals, although some would no doubt agree with her rejection\nof abject self-sacrifice and her recognition of proper concern with\nthe self as moral (Falk 1963; Gilligan 1982; Hampton 1993; Badhwar\n1993a). The general reader who responds positively to Rand\u2019s\nwork finds, for the first time, a moral justification for pursuing a\nlife of her or his own and a liberation from \u201cunearned\nguilt\u201d. The philosopher who responds negatively to her work\nfinds many biased and simplistic interpretations of philosophers and\nphilosophical doctrines, including her claim that she is the first to\nconsistently defend a morality of rational self-interest, all other\nphilosophers having defended either altruism or mysticism (Pojman\n1995). Her critics also challenge her equation of altruism with abject\nself-sacrifice (Rachels 2000, Flew 1984), and her claim (explained\nbelow) that there is no conflict between people\u2019s\nrational interests (Flew 1984). \n",
