    "main_text": "The Essence of Constructive and Intuitionistic Set Theory\n1. The Essence of Constructive and Intuitionistic Set Theory\n\n\nConstructive and intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theories are\nbased on intuitionistic rather than classical logic, and \nrepresent a natural environment within which to codify and study \nmathematics based on intuitionistic logic. \nFor constructive ZF, the main focus has been \nto represent the mathematical\npractice of Bishop (Bishop 1967, Bishop and Bridges\n1985).\n\n\nFor the basic concepts and the driving ideas of intuitionistic logic,\nconstructive mathematics and intuitionism, the reader may wish to\nconsult the following entries:\n\nintuitionistic logic,\nthe development of intuitionistic logic,\nconstructive mathematics,\nintuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics,\nLuitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer.\n\n\n\nFor classical set theory, see the entry on\n set theory.\n\n\nConstructive and intuitionistic ZF are based on the same first-order\nlanguage as classical ZF set theory,\nwhich has only the binary predicate symbol \\(\\in\\) (membership) as\nnon-logical symbol. That is, they are formulated on the basis of\nintuitionistic first-order logic with equality, plus the binary\npredicate symbol \\(\\in\\). We can thus take advantage of the simplicity\nof the set-theoretic language and of our familiarity with it (Myhill\n1975). As with Bishop-style constructive mathematics, Constructive and\nintuitionistic ZF are compatible with the classical\ntradition, in the sense that all of their theorems are classically\ntrue. In fact, the two formal systems that we shall consider,\nConstructive Zermelo-Fraenkel (CZF) and Intuitionistic\nZermelo-Fraenkel (IZF), give rise to full classical ZF by the simple\naddition of the principle of the excluded middle.\n",
