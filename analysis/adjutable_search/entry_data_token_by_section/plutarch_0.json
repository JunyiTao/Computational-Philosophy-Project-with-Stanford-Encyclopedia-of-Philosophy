    "main_text": "Life and works\n1. Life and works\n\n\nPlutarch was born in Chaeronea, a city of Boeotia in central Greece\naround 45\u201347 CE. This date is inferred from Plutarch's own\ntestimony (On the E at Delphi 385B), according to which he\nbegan studying at Athens with a Platonist philosopher named Ammonius\n(see Dillon 1977, 189\u2013192, Donini 1986b), when Nero was in\nGreece (66/67 CE). (This assumes that he was not more than twenty\nyears old at the time.) We know little about Ammonius and his school,\nthat is, also of Plutarch's institutional affiliation (the evidence of\nOn the E at Delphi 387F has been much debated; see\ne.g. Donini 1986a, 209\u2013212, 1986b, 108\u2013119, Opsomer 1998,\n21-25, 129-131). The main evidence about Ammonius' philosophical views\nis his speech as a character in On the E at Delphi\n(391E\u2013394C), on god, being, generation and corruption as well as\nhis contributions to the discussion in On the Obsolence of\nOracles (410F\u2013414C) regarding divine justice and providence\n(Dillon 1977, 189\u2013192, Opsomer 2009, 142\u2013179). This\nevidence can be reasonably considered indicative of Ammonius'\nengagement with metaphysics, which must have stimulated Plutarch's own\ninterest in metaphysical questions. Plutarch must have stayed in\nAthens not only during his studies with Ammonius but considerably\nlonger, so as to become an Athenian citizen (Table Talks\n628A). According to this testimony, he also visited Rome\n(Demetrius 2) and Alexandria (Table Talks 678A; see\nRussell 1973, 7\u20138). However, Plutarch spent most of his life in\nhis native city and in nearby Delphi. There must have been two reasons\nfor this; first, Plutarch's strong ties with his family, which\napparently was wealthy enough to support his studies and travels\n(Russell 1973, 3\u20135), and, second, his own interest in the\nreligious activity of Delphi. The latter is testified to by the fact\nthat Plutarch served in various positions in Delphi, including that of\nthe priest of Apollo (Table Talks 700E), and also in his\nseveral works concerning Delphi and the local sacred rituals (On\nthe E at Delphi, On Oracles at Delphi, On the Obsolescence of\nOracles; see Stadter 2005). These works demonstrate intimate\nknowledge of Delphi, its traditions, and activities. Plutarch must\nhave died after 119 CE, the date at which he was appointed procurator\nof Achaea by Hadrian (Eusebius' Chronicle).\n\nPlutarch was a prolific writer. The so-called Lamprias catalogue, an\nancient library catalogue (preserved mutilated), supposedly compiled by\nPlutarch's son Lamprias, lists 227 works, several of them no\nlonger extant (Russell 1973, 18\u201319). Plutarch's works divide into\nphilosophical and historical-biographical. The latter, the so-called\nLives (Bioi) of distinguished Greek and Roman men\nexamined in pairs, demonstrate Plutarch's historical and\nrhetorical abilities, also showing his interest in character formation\nand politics (Russell 1973, 100\u2013116). Plutarch's philosophical\nworks, many of them dialogues (set in Delphi or Chaeronea), cover half\nof his literary output. In modern times they have been published under\nthe collective term Moralia, a term first given to a\ncollection of eleven ethical works preserved in a 14th\ncentury manuscript (Parisinus Graecus 1672). When the collection was\naugmented by many other writings preserved in other manuscripts on\ntopics ranging from metaphysics, psychology, natural philosophy,\ntheology, logic, to philosophy of art, the name was retained with the\nmisleading implication that Plutarch's philosophical works are\nessentially or primarily ethical.\n\nAmong Plutarch's works, several serve polemical purposes. He wrote a\nnumber of works against the Stoic and Epicurean philosophies.  Against\nthe Stoics are mainly the works On the Self-contradictions of the\nStoics (De stoicorum repugnantiis), On the Common\nNotions against the Stoics (De communibus notitiis),\nOn the Cleverness of Animals (De sollertia\nanimalium), and On Moral Virtue (De virtute\nmorali). Plutarch's main works against the Epicureans are:\nThat One Cannot Live Happily Following Epicurus (Non\nposse suaviter vivere secundum Epicurum), Against\nColotes (Adversus Colotem), Is \u2018Live\nUnnoticed\u2019 Well Said? (An recte dictum sit latenter\nesse vivendum). All these works are marked by the use of a\ndistinct polemical tone against assumed adversaries, and of\nrecognizable polemical strategies. They are often captious and in many\ninstances betray a less than fair engagement with the views being\nopposed (see Warren 2011, 290\u2013293 and Kechagia 2011,\n135\u2013294 for a vindication of Plutarch's polemics in Against\nColotes).\n\nIt is worth considering why Plutarch engaged in writing so many\npolemical works against the two main Hellenistic schools of\nphilosophy.  One reason for Plutarch's preoccupation must be that the\nearly Stoics and Epicureans both strongly criticized Plato. The\nEpicurean Colotes, for instance, Plutarch's target in the Against\nColotes, was critical of Plato's dialogues in his Against\nPlato's Lysis and Against Plato's Euthydemus (meager fragments\nof which are preserved in Herculaneum papyri PHerc. 208,\nPHerc. 1032), while he also criticized the\nRepublic's myth of Er and the implied view of an immortal\nhuman soul (Proclus, In Rempublicam 2.109.11\u201312,\n111.6\u201317; see Kechagia 2011, 53\u2013132).  Another reason for\nPlutarch's engagement was the fact that both Epicureans and Stoics\ndrew freely and extensively for their own purposes on Plato without\nacknowledging it and despite their criticism of Plato. This holds true\nespecially for the Stoics (see Babut 1969a). They were inspired by the\nTimaeus, for instance, in their adoption of two principles,\ngod and matter, but their god, unlike that of Plato, is immanent in\nthe physical world and bodily, and he alone, without the Forms,\nsuffices for the formation of matter. The Stoics were probably guided\nto their view that only bodies exist by passages in the\nSophist (246a-247c) and in the Timaeus (31b-32c,\n49d-e, 53b-c). For Plutarch, though, this is an utterly mistaken\nreading of the Timaeus (De communibus notitiis\n1073D-1074E). Plutarch's polemics were, then, motivated by his desire to\nadvocate Platonism against what he regarded as misguided\ninterpretations and criticisms on the part of Epicureans and\nStoics. This defense of Platonism was of vital importance for\nPlatonism at Plutarch's time, since both Stoicism and Epicureanism were\nstill thriving, mainly in virtue of their ethics. Plutarch wanted to\nshow that Stoic and Epicurean ethics rest on mistaken assumptions\nabout human nature and reality, which render their ethical doctrines\nuseless (De virtute morali, De Stoicorum\nrepugnantiis 1041E-1043A, De communibus notitiis\n1060B-1073D). Plutarch's polemics were fuelled by the view he shares\nwith Hellenistic philosophers that the end of philosophy is to support\nethical life (see e.g. De profectibus in virtute); if a\nschool's ethical ideal is unrealizable or, worse, unworthy of human nature,\nthis for Plutarch (as for Antiochus, Cicero, De finibus 5.13,\n5.89) is evidence that the entire philosophical system is a\nfailure. As in the rest of his philosophical works, in his polemical\ntreatises too, Plutarch aims to show that Plato's philosophy makes\ngood sense as a whole, that is, it does justice to the world and human\nnature and can bring human beings to happiness (see below, sect. 2),\nbut in his polemical works Plutarch aims especially to demonstrate\nthat departure from Plato results in self-contradictions, of which he\naccuses the Stoics in particular (Boys-Stones 1997a). Two further\nfeatures of Stoic and Epicurean philosophy appear to annoy Plutarch\nconsiderably: first, their dismissal of the aporetic/dialectical\nspirit that Socrates embodies, and which Plutarch regards as central\nto philosophy, and second, that Stoics and Epicureans alike adopt a\ncorporealist or materialist metaphysics, rejecting the intelligible\nrealm (that comprises god, Forms, immaterial souls), which was\nessential to Platonism. The central line permeating Plutarch's\nrelevant criticism is that Stoics and Epicureans contradict our common\nnotions (see e.g. De communibus notitiis 1073C-1074F) and do\nnot do justice to things themselves (De profectibus in\nvirtute 75F-76A). Ironically, perhaps, Plutarch's polemical\nwritings are chiefly of interest\u2014but also of very great\nvalue\u2014for the many quotations they contain from Stoics,\nEpicurus, and other authors whose works were not preserved into modern\ntimes, and for his references to and paraphrases of their views in\nother passages of works available to him but not to us. Were it not\nfor Plutarch, our grasp of Stoic and Epicurean philosophy would be\nmuch less extensive than it is, and our ability to reconstruct and\nappreciate their ideas much reduced.\n\nHere is an overview of Plutarch's works, to give a sense of his\nconception of philosophy and of what in Platonist philosophy especially\nhe valued.\n\nPlutarch wrote relatively little in the field of \u201clogic\u201d\nin the ancient sense (logik\u00ea), which includes\nphilosophy of language and epistemology. This, however, does not\nnecessarily point to a lack of interest or knowledge on his\npart. Quite the opposite is the case. Plutarch is particularly\nattracted to epistemology because he considers this as a crucial\naspect of Platonist philosophy. He seeks to defend the epistemology of\nAcademic skeptics like Arcesilaus and Carneades and on these grounds\nto advocate the unity of the Academy against the criticisms of\nAntiochus of Ascalon (1st c. BCE; see below, sects. 2 and\n3). The Lamprias list of Plutarch's works contains one on Stoic logic\n(Reply to Chrysippus on the First Consequent, #152), and two\non Aristotle's: On Aristotle's Topics in eight books (#56),\nand a Lecture on the Ten Categories (#192), all of them now\nlost. The latter two are indicative of a reawakening of interest in\nAristotelian logic, beginning in the 1st c. BCE, cultivated\nmainly by Peripatetics such as Boethus and Andronicus, but also\ncharacterizing Platonists of Plutarch's era, such as Eudorus and\nNicostratus, who set themselves in dialogue especially with\nAristotle's Categories.  Although the content of these\nPlutarchean works remains unknown, we do have Plutarch's own claim\nthat Aristotle's doctrine of categories is foreshadowed in the\nTimaeus (De an.  procr. 1023E; Timaeus\n37b-c), which suggests that he considered Aristotelian logic a welcome\ndevelopment of relevant Platonic ideas (Karamanolis 2006,\n123\u2013125). Plutarch's interest in the Topics, on the\nother hand, must have been motivated by his interest in the\ndialectical methodology of arguing both sides of a question\n(Karamanolis 2006, 86\u201387; see further below, sect. 3), to which\nthe Topics is devoted. Plutarch's works on epistemology cover\na broad spectrum of issues. The question of the criterion of truth\nmust have been central to works such as On How We Should Judge\nTruth (#225), What is Understanding?  (#144), That\nUnderstanding is Impossible (#146), none of which is extant\ntoday. The lost work Whether He Who Suspends Judgment on\nEverything is Led to Inaction (#158) must have confronted the\ncommon accusation against skepticism voiced in its title. Among\nPlutarch's surviving works important for understanding his\nepistemology are the Platonic Questions I and III,\nAgainst Colotes, On Common Notions, and On the\nGeneration of the Soul 1024F-1025A (see below, sect.  3).\n\nPlutarch paid special attention to \u201cphysics,\u201d, which in\nantiquity included metaphysics, natural philosophy, psychology and\ntheology. His most important surviving works in metaphysics are those\nrelated to the interpretation of the Timaeus, namely On\nthe Generation of Soul in the Timaeus (De animae procreatione\nin Timaeo), On Isis and Osiris (De Iside et\nOsiride); from lost works of Plutarch relevant are the following:\nWhere are the Forms? (#67), How Matter Participates in\nthe Forms: It Constitutes the Primary Bodies (#68), On the\nWorld's Having Come into Beginning According to Plato (#66),\nOn Matter (#185), On the Fifth Substance\n(#44). Plutarch shows quite some interest in the explanation of\nnatural phenomena in several surviving works, most importantly in:\nOn the Face Which Appears in the Orb of the Moon (De facie quae in\norbe lunae apparet), On the Principle of Cold (De primo\nfrigido), On the Cleverness of Animals (De sollertia\nanimalism). Plutarch's interest in this area is apparently\nmotivated by the wish to develop Platonist natural philosophy and also\noppose the Stoics, who were dominant in this field especially since\nPosidonius (1st c. BCE), and in Plutarch's age with his\nmuch older contemporary Seneca (ca. 1BCE\u201365CE), the\nauthor of Naturales Quaestiones. Given the importance of god\nin the world's coming into being according to Plutarch, he is\nseriously engaged with theology, especially with questions pertaining\nto the relation between god and man, such as the issue of divination,\ndivine justice and divine punishment, and so on, in: On Oracles at\nDelphi (De Pythiae oraculis), On the Obsolescence of\nOracles (De defectu oraculorum), On the E at\nDelphi (De E apud Delphos), On Delays in Divine\nPunishment (De sera numinis vindicta), and On the\nDaemon of Socrates (De genio Socratis Socratis).\nPlutarch's On the Generation of Soul in the Timaeus together\nwith the ten Platonic Questions illustrate well his work as a\nPlatonic exegete (see Hershbell 1987, Ferrari 2001). Like the former\nwork, most of the Platonic Questions also deal with\nmetaphysics and psychology (Questions I and III are concerned\nwith epistemology, VII with physics, and X with language).\n\nPlutarch's ethical works include some of theoretical orientation\n(e.g. On Moral Virtue, which refutes the Stoic theory of\nvirtue) and some of practical one (e.g. On Control of Anger, On\nCuriosity, How Could you Tell a Flatterer from a Friend),\noffering practical advice on how to attain virtue and build a good\ncharacter. The tendency, however, to distinguish two altogether\nseparate classes of ethical works (following Ziegler 1951,\n768\u2013825) is problematic given the considerable affinities\nbetween them, yet Plutarch does use different styles in them,\npresumably targeting different audiences (Van Hoof 2010,\n264\u2013265). Particularly representative of Plutarch's ethical\nviews are the treatises On Moral Virtue (De virtute\nmorali), On Making Progress in Virtue (De\nprofectibus in virtute), On Delays in Divine Punishment\n(De sera numinis vindicta), On Control of Anger\n(De cohibenda ira), and On Tranquility of Mind\n(De tranquillitate animi). Plutarch wrote also works on\naesthetics and education, which one could classify also as works of\npractical orientation. Plutarch, following Plato, evaluates poetry\nfrom the point of view of ethical education. In this category belong\nthe works On How the Young Man Should Listen to Poets (De\naudiendis poetis) and On the Education of Children\n(De liberis educandis), the latter of dubious authenticity\n(Ziegler 1951, 809\u2013811).\n\nFinally, Plutarch wrote a number of works on aspects and figures of the\nhistory of philosophy, all lost, such as On What Heraclitus\nMaintained (#205), On Empedocles (#43), On the\nCyrenaics (#188), On the Difference between Pyrrhonians and\nAcademics (#64), On the Unity of the Academy Since Plato\n(#63). The latter two could not have been merely historical, however; the\nhistorical perspective must rather have served to defend the point of view of the\nskeptical Academy, which Plutarch advocated as doing justice to the\naporetic spirit of Plato's philosophy (see below, sect. 2).\n",
