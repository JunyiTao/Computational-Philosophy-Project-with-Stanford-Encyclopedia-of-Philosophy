    "main_text": "Justification and Internalism\n3. Justification and Internalism\n\nKnowledge internalism and externalism have been less extensively\ndiscussed in recent literature than justification internalism and\nexternalism. These two opposing theses focus on justified belief\nrather than knowledge, though there are close parallels. Consider\nagain the Canada geese example, and suppose that the testimony you\nreceive from another person produces in you the justified belief that\nthere are geese in the park. We may also suppose that this justified\nbelief falls short of knowledge. We can say that a justifier\nfor this belief is the testimony one has received from the other\nperson. Here a justifier is an analog of what was termed above a\nknowledge basis and, as in the latter case, we will allow\nthat justifiers can be other beliefs, or experiences, or facts about\nthe production of the belief. Philosophers take different stances on\nwhat legitimate justifiers may be, so that it is difficult to come up\nwith an account of justifiers that is neutral between competing\ntheories of epistemic justification. It will not do to say that\neverything relevant to a person's justified belief at some time counts\nas a justifier for that belief. For that would count possession of the\nconcepts that are necessary for one to understand a belief that p as\namong the justifiers for that belief, and clearly that would be a\nmistake. Instead, we can say this: The justifiers for a given\njustified belief are those items that make up or constitute the\nperson's justification for that belief at that time. They are those\nitems, whether experiences, states of affairs, or other beliefs, on\nwhich the person's current justification is based. (the term\n\u2018justifier\u2019 comes from Alston 1989, 189).\n\nWhen one has a justified belief, one is sometimes also aware of the\njustifiers for that belief. And perhaps, for any justified belief and\naccompanying justifiers, one can become aware of the justifiers, and\ndo this merely by reflection. This is the core idea behind\njustification internalism. As with knowledge internalism, this core\nidea has to do with a form of access, in this case access to the\njustifiers. Further, continuing the parallel with knowledge\ninternalism, justification internalism can be construed as having weak\nand strong forms: weak and strong accessibility justification\ninternalism. We may here safely assume that access\ninternalism concerning justification will be no more plausible that\nits cousin regarding knowledge, discussed above; hence, access\ninternalism regarding justification will be passed over in favor of\nversions stressing accessibility rather than actual access.\n\nStill, there is the question of whether justification internalism\ndemands accessibility of all of the justifiers for a given\njustified belief or only some of them. Discussions of justification\ninternalism have tended to focus on the former of these. Here are some\npassages that point in this direction.\n\nInternalism\u2026treats justifiedness as a purely internal matter:\nif p is justified for S, then S must be\naware (or at least be immediately capable of being aware) of what\nmakes it justified and why. (Bach 1985, 250; quoted in Alston 1989,\n212)\n\n\nWe presuppose, second, that the things we know are justified for us in\nthe following sense: we can know what it is, on any occasion, that\nconstitutes our grounds, or reason, or evidence for thinking that we\nknow. (Chisholm 1977, 17; quoted in Alston 1989, 212.)\n\n\nThe most explicit statement of this view comes from Carl Ginet:\n\nEvery one of every set of facts about S's position that\nminimally suffices to make S, at a given time, justified in\nbeing confident that p must be directly recognizable to\nS at that time. (Ginet 1975, 34; quoted in Alston 1989, 213)\n\n\nIn line with these sentiments, we could define two concepts of\naccessibility justification internalism, analogous to knowledge\ninternalism that requires accessibility of the complete knowledge\nbasis. We would have these two theses:\n\nWeak AJI:\n\nOne has a justified belief that p only if one can become\naware by reflection of all of one's justifiers for p.\nStrong AJI:\n\nOne has a justified belief that p only if one can become\naware by reflection that some item j makes up all of one's\njustification for p.\n\n\nWith strong AJI as just given, the item j might be a single\njustifier, perhaps a single previously justified belief; or it might\nbe a complex, taking any number of contributing justifiers as\nelements, as would be the case with a complex of many previously\njustified beliefs making up one's evidence for p. What is to\nbe stressed is that in both weak and strong AJI as here defined,\nability to access all of the justifiers is required; this is a demand\nfor accessibility of the complete justification basis, we might say,\non a par with the earlier discussion of a complete knowledge basis.\nThese are, then, complete justifier accounts of weak and\nstrong AKI.\n\nIt is unlikely, however, that these two forms of justification\ninternalism will stand up to close scrutiny. To see this, consider a\ncase of rapid acquisition of many justified beliefs at a single moment\nor in a very short and hurried period of time. We need only think of\nsome emergency situation where very swift reactions are needed, and\nwhere the presence of the emergency is based upon a host of sensory\ncues. In such cases a person will often acquire a battery of justified\nbeliefs, all pretty much in an instant of time, and quick action on\nthose beliefs is necessary to avert some disaster or other unwanted\nconsequence. Certainly the person cannot access, at the acquisition\nmoment, all of the justifiers for each of these newly acquired\njustified beliefs; she is too busy taking steps to avert the disaster.\nNor should we think that she will be able to access all of the\njustifiers for those beliefs at a later, and calmer time; for, however\ngood her memory might be, it is just unrealistic to suppose that each\nperson will be able to recall all of those justifiers for every one of\nthose justified beliefs. This would be too great a demand to place on\nmemory in the interests of an epistemological theory. It is better to\ngive up the epistemological theory in favor of something more\nfeasible. Such a view is easy enough to come by; we simply weaken\nthings to yield partial justifier accounts of justification\ninternalism.\n\nWeak AJI:\n\nOne has a justified belief that p only if one can become\naware by reflection of some essential justifier one then has for\np.\nStrong AJI:\n\nOne has a justified belief that p only if one can become\naware that some item j is an essential justifier one then has\nfor p.\n\n\nWe thus see that weak and strong internalism regarding justification\nare straight analogs of weak and strong internalism regarding\nknowledge. Further, these versions of justification internalism are\nmuch more plausible than the complete justifier versions of\njustification internalism. It is, after all, easier for just about any\ncognizer to access some essential justifier in any given case than it\nis to access all of them.\n\nAnother important point concerns the time at which one does or could\nbecome aware of essential justifiers. We have hitherto spoken as\nthough the internalist is demanding that each cognizer have the\nability at any given moment to then become aware of\nessential justfiers for each of her justified beliefs. There is no\nreason why internalism should be understood in this fashion. To see\nthe point, imagine that some essential justifier j, for\nbelief b, itself has five sub-elements, where each of these\nis an essential justifier. Perhaps the cognizer can become aware, by\nreflection, of two of these elements of j at a single time,\nbut become aware of the remaining three only after much reflection\nlasting some period of time. Nothing in the internalist picture should\nrule this out. What is essential is that the awareness be achieved by\ndirect reflection, and not that it all occur at a moment.\n\nMichael Bergmann (2009) gives a definition that is akin to Strong AJI.\nIt is this:\n\nPotential Doxastic Strong Awareness Requirement (PDSAR):\n\nS's belief B is justified only if (i) there is\nsomething, X, that contributes to the justification of B\nand (ii) S is able on reflection alone to be aware of X\nin such a way that S justifiably believes that X is in\nsome way relevant to the appropriateness of holding B.\n(Bergmann 2006, 16)\n\n\nWhat Bergmann takes as the relevant contributing factor is what was\ncalled in Strong AJI a justifier, though his definition does not\nrequire that the contributing factor be essential to the justification\nfor belief B. Some defenders of access internalism might object that\nthey are not committed to the potential awareness of a contributor to\njustification being relevant to the appropriateness of holding the\ntarget belief, as specified in PDSAR. However, this issue will not be\na factor in what follows.\n\nExternalism with regard to justification is also analogous to\nknowledge externalism. That is, the weak form of justification\nexternalism is a thesis that merely denies strong AJI, and is\nperfectly compatible with weak AJI. More interesting is strong\njustification externalism, or strong AJE, namely:\n\nStrong AJE:\n\nIt is false that: one has a justified belief that p only if\none can become aware of some justifier or other for one's belief that\np.\n\n\nThe idea here is that it is false that one is always in a position to\naccess at least one justifier for each one of one's justified beliefs;\nin some cases, one is unable to access by reflection any of the\njustifiers, and this fact does nothing to impugn or weaken one's\njustification for the belief. For an illustration, think again of the\nemergency situation where one gains a number of beliefs nearly all at\nonce, all of them justified by a number of different justifiers. It is\nplausible to think that in some cases of this sort, one is unable to\naccess merely by reflection any of the justifiers, either at the\nmoment of belief acquisition or at any later time. Notice that strong\nAJE does not contend that one is never able to access\nrelevant justifiers. It claims instead that there are some cases where\none cannot become aware by reflection of any of one's justifiers for a\nbelief that p, and that this fact does not undercut one's\njustification for believing that p.\n\nOne way to see the import of the externalist position regarding\njustification is by means of examples. The case described earlier\nwherein one gains a great number of justified perceptual beliefs all\nin a short and very compressed time span seems appropriate to this\npurpose. Another method for getting a sense of the externalist\nposition is by consideration of a theory of epistemic justification\nthat is consistent with it. A simple version of the reliable process\ntheory of justification will illustrate the point (see Goldman 1979,\nfor a classic statement):\n\nA person S is justified in believing a proposition p\nif and only if S's belief that p is produced or\nsustained by a process or method M and M is\nreliable.\n\nIn this illustrative context we may think of the reliability of\nM as the actual frequency with which true beliefs are\nproduced or sustained by M. If more true beliefs have been\nproduced or sustained by M than false beliefs, then\nM is reliable. The main point for present purposes is this:\nbeing so produced or sustained suffices for justification of belief.\nNothing more is required, either of the process M or the\nepistemic agent S. Since this is so, then nothing\nfurther is required concerning accessibility to S of\nany of her justifiers for belief that p. \n\nThis theory is illustrative only. No defender of a reliable process\ntheory of justification is apt to regard reliability as determined\nmerely by the actual frequency of true versus false belief production\nor sustenance. Instead, reliability would be thought of as a\npropensity that a method M has to produce or sustain\nmostly true beliefs. This important point about how to best understand\nreliability, however, will not affect the point just made concerning\nreliable process theories and externalism regarding justification.\nExactly the same argument will apply when reliability is understood as\na propensity. Reliability of that sort as applied to process\nM will suffice for the belief to be justified.. Accessibility\nvia reflection to any of the justifiers, if present as a capability in\nS, will not be relevant to her being justified in believing\np, and neither will the absence of such a capability. So, if\nthe reliable process theory as here depicted is correct as an account\nof justified belief, then internalism regarding justification would be\nfalse. This point about lack of access to justifiers is the main\ncontention of the externalist thesis regarding justification. (The\nactual long run frequency and propensity interpretations of\nreliability were clearly noted in Goldman 1979, 11. Reference to\njustifiers is not there made by Goldman; that term came into use about\na decade later in work by Alston. Goldman gives more refined and\ncomplex statements of the theory, making use of J-rules, in Goldman\n1986, 2009.) \n",
