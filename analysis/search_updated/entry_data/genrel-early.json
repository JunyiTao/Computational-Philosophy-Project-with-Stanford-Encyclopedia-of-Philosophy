    "preamble": "\n\nEarly philosophical interpretations of the general theory of\nrelativity selected distinct aspects of that theory for favored\nrecognition. Followers of Mach initially lauded Einstein\u2019s\nattempt to implement a \u201crelativization of inertia\u201d in the\ngeneral theory, but ultimately were more comfortable with\nEinstein\u2019s operationalist treatment of the concept of distant\nsimultaneity in the special theory. Kantians and neo-Kantians, if\nfreed from strict fealty to the doctrines of the Transcendental\nAesthetic and Transcendental Analytic, pointed to the surpassing\nimportance of certain synthetic \u201cintellectual forms\u201d in\nthe general theory, above all, the principle of general covariance. To\nan emerging logical empiricism, the philosophical significance of\nrelativity theory was above all methodological, that conventions must\nfirst be laid down in order to express the empirical content of a\nphysical theory. In a more far reaching development, already by its\ncompletion in November 1915, attempts were made to extend general\nrelativity\u2019s geometrization of gravitational force to\nnon-gravitational interactions, in particular, to electromagnetism.\nAmong these, that of Weyl, and shortly thereafter of Eddington, may be\ndistinguished from others, in particular from Einstein\u2019s many\nsubsequent proposals. Weyl and Eddington aimed not only at a unified\nfield theory, in the sense of a classical field theory in which all\nfundamental interactions are described by objects of spacetime\ngeometry, but also at reconstructing gravitation and electromagnetism\nfrom the epistemological standpoint of a refurbished transcendental\nidealism.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Search for Philosophical Novelty\n\nExtraordinary public clamor greeted an announcement of the joint\nmeeting of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Astronomical\nSociety on the sixth of November 1919. Astronomical observations made\nby a British team during the solar eclipse on May 29 comprised the\nfirst empirical test of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.\nLengthy data analysis of the observations over the summer had shown\nthat within acceptable margin of error, light from distant stars\npassing near the solar surface was displaced by the tiny amount (1.75\narcseconds, corresponding to the angle of a right triangle of height 1\ninch and base nearly 2 miles in length) predicted by Einstein\u2019s\ngravitational theory of curved spacetime. By dint of having\n\u201coverthrown\u201d such a permanent fixture of the cognitive\nlandscape as Newtonian gravitational theory, the general theory of\nrelativity at once became a principal focus of philosophical interest\nand inquiry. Although some physicists and philosophers initially\nopposed it, mostly on non-physical grounds, surveyed here are the\nprincipal philosophical interpretations of those accepting the theory\nas a revolutionary advance in physical knowledge. Even so, these\ninclude positions ill-informed as to the mathematics and physics of\nthe theory. Further lack of clarity stemmed from the scientific\nliterati who provided differing, and at times, conflicting\nmathematical or physical accounts of the theory\u2019s fundamental\nprinciples. These are (see below): the principles of equivalence and\nof what Einstein misleadingly termed \u201cgeneral relativity\u201d\n(i.e., general covariance), and finally one he baptized as\nMach\u2019s Principle, of the complete relativization of\ninertia. In one or another form, these controversies have largely\ncontinued into the present literature of physics and philosophy of\nphysics (see, e.g., Stachel 1980; Friedman 1983; Norton 1993; Barbour\n& Pfister 1995; Ohanian 2008; Janssen 2014; Ryckman 2017). This is\nnot unusual: physical theories, if sufficiently robust, are rarely, if\never, without ambiguous or problematic aspects, and are often taken to\nsay different things at different stages of development. But the very\nfluidity of physical and mathematical meaning lent interpretative\nlatitude for inherently antagonistic philosophical viewpoints seeking\nvindication, confirmation or illumination by the revolutionary new\ntheory. Perhaps only semi-facetiously, Bertrand Russell observed\nthat\n\n\nThere has been a tendency, not uncommon in the case of a new\nscientific theory, for every philosopher to interpret the work of\nEinstein in accordance with his own metaphysical system, and to\nsuggest that the outcome is a great accession of strength to the views\nwhich the philosopher in question previously held. This cannot be true\nin all cases; and it may be hoped that it is true in none. It would be\ndisappointing if so fundamental a change as Einstein has introduced\ninvolved no philosophical novelty. (1926: 331)\n\n\nIt cannot be denied that general relativity proved a considerable\nstimulus to philosophical novelty. But then the question whether it\nparticularly supported any one line of philosophical interpretation\nover another must take into account the fact that schools of\ninterpretation in turn evolved to accommodate what were regarded as\ngeneral relativity\u2019s philosophically salient features. A classic\ninstance is the assertion, to become a cornerstone of logical\nempiricism, that relativity theory had shown the untenability of any\n\u201cphilosophy of the synthetic a priori\u201d, despite\nthe fact that early works on relativity theory by both Hans\nReichenbach and Rudolf Carnap were written from within that broad\nperspective. It will be seen that, however ideologically useful, the\nclaim by no means follows from relativity theory although, as\nphysicist Max von Laue noted in his early text on general relativity\n(1921: 42), \u201cnot every sentence of The Critique of Pure\nReason\u201d might still be held intact. What does follow from\nscrutiny of the various philosophical appropriations of general\nrelativity is a consummate illustration that, due to the evolution and\nmutual interplay of physical, mathematical and philosophical\nunderstandings of a revolutionary physical theory, philosophical\ninterpretations often are works in progress, extending over many\nyears.\n2. Machian Positivism\n2.1 In the Early Einstein\n\nMost of Einstein\u2019s early papers (1902\u20131911) prior to his\nnearly exclusive concentration on a relativitistic theory of\ngravitation (1909\u20131915) are devoted not to the theory of\nrelativity but with problems posed to classical physics by\nPlanck\u2019s discovery of his eponymous energy constant in 1900.\nThese early works reveal Einstein to be a strong supporter of Ludwig\nBoltzmann rather than Ernst Mach in the debate over atomism at the\nturn of the century (Ryckman 2017: chapter 3). Yet in 1912,\nEinstein\u2019s name together with those of G\u00f6ttingen\nmathematicians David Hilbert and Felix Klein, was prominently\ndisplayed (in the Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau 27: 336)\namong those joining Mach\u2019s in a call for the formation of a\n\u201cSociety for Positivist Philosophy\u201d. Citing the pressing\nneed of science \u201cbut also of our age in general\u201d for a\n\u201ccomprehensive world view based on the material facts\naccumulated in the individual sciences\u201d, the appeal appears\nabove all to have been an orchestrated attempt to buttress\nMach\u2019s positivist conception of science in the face of recent\ncriticisms by Max Planck, then Germany\u2019s leading theoretical\nphysicist. More a declaration of allegiance than an act of scholarly\nneutrality, it provides evidence of Einstein\u2019s youthful\nenthusiasm for at least certain of Mach\u2019s writings. Late in life\n(1949a: 21), Einstein wrote of the \u201cprofound influence\u201d\nthat Mach\u2019s Science of Mechanics (1883) exercised upon\nhim as a student as well as of the very great influence in his younger\nyears of \u201cMach\u2019s epistemological position\u201d. Already\nin the special theory of relativity (1905), Einstein\u2019s\noperational definition of the \u201csimultaneity\u201d of distantly\nseparated events, whereby distant clocks are synchronized by sending\nand receiving light signals, is closely modeled on the operational\ndefinition of mass in Mach\u2019s Mechanics. Moreover,\noccasional epistemological and methodological pronouncements seem to\nindicate agreement with core parts of Mach\u2019s positivist doctrine\nof meaningfulness, e.g., \u201cThe concept does not exist for the\nphysicist until he has the possibility of discovering whether or not\nit is fulfilled in an actual case\u201d (1917a [1955: 22]). Thus the\ngeneral theory of relativity might be seen as fully compliant with\nMach\u2019s characterization of theoretical concepts as merely\neconomical shorthand for concrete observations or operations.\n2.2 A \u201cRelativization of Inertia\u201d?\n\nMachian influences specific to the general theory of relativity\nappeared even more extensive. Mach\u2019s id\u00e9e fixe,\nthat a body\u2019s inertial mass and motion result from the influence\nof all other surrounding masses (thus eliminating the\n\u201cmonstrous\u201d Newtonian concept of absolute space), was\nperhaps the strongest motivation guiding Einstein\u2019s pursuit of a\nrelativistic theory of gravity. In papers leading up to the definitive\npresentation of the general theory of relativity in 1916, Einstein\nmade no secret of the fact that Mach was the inspiration for an\nepistemologically mandated attempt to generalize the principle of\nrelativity. Holding, with Mach, that no observable facts could be\nassociated with the notions of absolute acceleration or\nabsolute inertia (i.e., resistance to acceleration), the\ngeneralization required that the laws of nature be completely\nindependent of the state of motion of any chosen reference system. In\nfact, in striving to completely relativize inertia, Einstein conflated\na valid principle of form invariance of the laws of nature (general\ncovariance, see below) with a spurious \u201cprinciple of general\nrelativity\u201d, according to which accelerated motions like\nrotations would be relative to an observer\u2019s state of motion. In\na warm obituary of Mach written within a few days of completing the\ndefinitive 1916 presentation of his theory, Einstein, quoting\nextensively from the famous passages in Mach\u2019s\nMechanics critical of Newton\u2019s \u201cabsolute\u201d\nconcepts of space, time and motion, generously avowed that\nMach\u2019s understanding of the principles of mechanics had brought\nhim very close to demanding a general theory of relativity a\nhalf-century earlier (1916b: 102\u20133). No doubt with this\nreference in mind, physicist Phillip Frank, later to be associated\nwith the Vienna Circle, observed that\n\n\nit is universally known today that Einstein\u2019s general theory of\nrelativity grew immediately out of the positivistic doctrine of space\nand motion. (1917 [1949: 68])\n\n\nBut, as noted above, there are both genuine and specious aspects\nconnected with Einstein\u2019s \u201cprinciple of general\nrelativity\u201d, a mixture complicated by Einstein\u2019s own\npuzzling remarks regarding the principle of general covariance.\n2.3 Positivism and the \u201cHole Argument\u201d\n\nA passage from \u00a73 of Einstein\u2019s first complete exposition\nof the general theory of relativity (1916a) appeared to provide\nfurther grist for the mill of Machian positivism. There Einstein\ngrandly declared that his requirement of general covariance for the\ngravitational field equations (i.e., that they remain unchanged under\narbitrary, but suitably continuous, transformation of the spacetime\ncoordinates), \u201ctakes away from space and time the last remnant\nof physical objectivity\u201d. An accompanying heuristic reflection\non the reasoning behind this claim seemed nothing less than an\nendorsement of Mach\u2019s phenomenalism. \u201cAll our space-time\nverifications\u201d, Einstein wrote, \u201cinvariably amount to a\ndetermination of space-time coincidences\u2026\u201d. This is\nbecause, Einstein presumed, all results of physical measurement\nultimately amount to verifications of such coincidences, such as the\nobservation of the coincidence of the second hand of a clock with a\nmark on its dial, or the point-like mark of a particle made on a\ndetection screen. Observing that such (topological) relations alone\nare preserved under arbitrary coordinate transformation, Einstein\nconcluded that \u201call our physical experience can ultimately be\nreduced to such coincidences\u201d. To Mach\u2019s followers,\nEinstein\u2019s illustrative reflection was nothing less than an\nexplicit avowal of the centerpiece of Mach\u2019s phenomenalist\nepistemology, that sensations (Empfindungen), directly\nexperienced sensory perceptions, alone are real and knowable. Thus\nJosef Petzoldt, a Machian philosopher and editor of the 8th\nedition of Mach\u2019s Mechanics , the first to appear after\nthe general theory of relativity, noted that Einstein\u2019s remarks\nmeant that the theory \u201crests, in the end, on the perception of\nthe coincidence of sensations\u201d and so \u201cis fully in accord\nwith Mach\u2019s world-view, which is best characterized as\nrelativistic positivism\u201d (1921: 516).\n\nHowever, contemporary scholarship has shown that Einstein\u2019s\nremarks here were but elliptical references to an argument (the\nso-called \u201cHole Argument\u201d) that has only fully been\nreconstructed from his private correspondence. Its conclusion is that,\nif a theory is generally covariant, the bare points of the spacetime\nmanifold can have no inherent primitive identity (inherited say, from\nthe manifold\u2019s underlying topology), and so no reality\nindependent of, in particular, the value of the metrical field\nassociated with each point by a particular solution of the Einstein\nfield equations (Stachel 1980; Norton 1984, 1993). Thus for a\ngenerally covariant theory, no physical reality accrues to\n\u201cempty space\u201d in the absence of any physical fields. In\nEinstein\u2019s rhetorical embellishment, general covariance\n\u201ctakes away from space and time the last remnant of physical\nobjectivity\u201d; what he should have said is that spacetime\ncoordinates are nothing more than arbitrary labels or parameters for\nthe identification of physical events [see entry on\n the hole argument].\n Hence this passage is not really an endorsement of positivist\nphenomenalism.\n2.4 \u201cMach\u2019s Principle\u201d\n\nFor a number of years Einstein expressed the ambition of the general\ntheory of relativity to fully implement Mach\u2019s program for the\nrelativization of all inertial effects, even appending the so-called\ncosmological constant in an attempt to obtain a fully Machian\nglobal solution to his field equations (1917b) for this purpose. This\ngenuine point of contact of Mach\u2019s influence was clearly\nidentified only in 1918, when Einstein distinguished what he baptized\nas Mach\u2019s Principle \u2014(too) strongly stated as the\nrequirement that the metric field (responsible for\ngravitational-inertial properties of bodies) on the left hand side of\nhis field equation, is completely determined by the\nenergy-momentum tensor on the right hand side\u2014from the principle\nof general relativity which he misleadingly interpreted as the\nprinciple of general covariance. Taken together with the principle of\nthe equivalence, Einstein asserted that the three principles, were\nthree pillars on which his theory rested, even if they could not be\nthought completely independent of one another. Despite\nEinstein\u2019s intent, there is considerable disagreement about the\nextent to which, if at all, the general theory of relativity could\nconform to anything like Mach\u2019s Principle. The Dutch astronomer\nWillem De Sitter had immediately shown in 1917 that the Einstein field\nequations, even as augmented with the new cosmological constant,\npermitted matter-free solutions. Machians still have some room for\nmaneuver due to vagaries regarding just what such a principle actually\nrequires. On the other hand, it remains difficult to comprehend just\nwhat physical process or mechanism might implement the principle,\nhowever interpreted. How, for instance, might a given body\u2019s\ninertial mass be accounted due to the influence of all other masses in\nthe universe? (See the discussions in Barbour & Pfister 1995.)\n2.5 Emerging Anti-Positivism\n\nAs Einstein\u2019s principal research activity turned, after 1919, to\nthe pursuit of a geometrical theory unifying gravitation and\nelectromagnetism, his philosophical pronouncements increasingly took\non a more realist or at least anti-positivist coloration. Lecturing at\nthe Sorbonne in April 1922 (1922: 28), Einstein pronounced Mach\n\u201cun bon m\u00e9canicien\u201d (probably a reference\nto Mach\u2019s views of the relativity of inertia) but \u201cun\nd\u00e9plorable philosophe\u201d. Increasingly,\nEinstein\u2019s retrospective portrayals of the genesis of general\nrelativity centered almost entirely on the success of a strategy\nemphasizing mathematical aesthetics (see Norton 2000, Ryckman 2014,\nand\n \u00a75).\n Positivists and operationalists alike continued to point to the\nEinstein analysis of simultaneity as relativity theory\u2019s\nfundamental methodological feature. One, ruefully noting the\ndifficulty of giving an operationalist analysis of the general theory,\neven suggested that the requirement of general covariance\n\u201cconceals the possibility of disaster\u201d (Bridgman 1949:\n354). Finally there was, for Einstein, an understandable awkwardness\nin learning of Mach\u2019s surprising disavowal of any role as\nforerunner to relativity theory in the Preface, dated 1913,\nto Mach\u2019s posthumous book (1921) on physical optics. Though\nEinstein died without knowing differently, a recent investigation has\nbuilt a strong case that this statement was forged after Mach\u2019s\ndeath by his son Ludwig, under the influence of a rival guardian of\nMach\u2019s legacy and opponent of relativity theory, the philosopher\nHugo Dingler (Wolters 1987).\n3. Kantian and Neo-Kantian Interpretations\n3.1 Neo-Kantians on Special Relativity\n\nIn the universities of Imperial and early Weimar Germany, the\nphilosophy of Kant, particularly the various neo-Kantian schools, held\npride of place. Of these, the Marburg School of Hermann Cohen and Paul\nNatorp, including Cohen\u2019s student Ernst Cassirer, exhibited a\nspecial interest in the philosophy of the physical sciences and of\nmathematics. Yet prior to the general theory of relativity\n(1915\u20131916), Kantian philosophers accorded relativity theory\nonly cursory attention. This may be seen in two leading Marburg works\nappearing in 1910, Cassirer\u2019s Substanzbegriff und\nFunktionsbegriff and Natorp\u2019s Die Logischen Grundlagen\nder Exakten Wissenschaften. Both books conform to the\ncharacteristic Marburg modification that greatly extended the scope of\nKant\u2019s Transcendental Logic, bringing under \u201cpure\nthought\u201d or \u201cintellectual forms\u201d what Kant had\nsharply separated in a distinction between the purely passive faculty\nof sensibility and the active faculties of understanding and reason.\nOf course, this revisionist tendency greatly transforms the meaning of\nKant\u2019s Transcendental Aesthetic and with it Kant\u2019s\nconviction that space and time were forms of sensibility or pure\nintuitions a priori and so as well, his accounts of\narithmetic and geometry. As will be seen, it enabled Cassirer, some\nten years later, to view even the general theory of relativity as a\nstriking confirmation of the fundamental tenets of transcendental\nidealism. In 1910, however, Cassirer\u2019s brief but diffuse\ndiscussion of \u201cthe problem of relativity\u201d mentions neither\nthe principle of relativity nor the light postulate nor the names of\nEinstein, Lorentz or Minkowski. Rather it centers on the question of\nwhether space and time are aggregates of sense impressions or\n\u201cindependent intellectual (gedankliche) forms\u201d.\nHaving decided in favor of the latter, Cassirer goes on to argue how\nand why these ideal mathematical presuppositions are necessarily\nrelated to measurable, empirical notions of space, time, and motion\n(1910: 228\u20139 [1923: 172\u20133]).\n\nNatorp\u2019s treatment, though scarcely six pages is more detailed\n(1910: 399\u2013404). In revisionist fashion, the \u201cMinkowski\n(sic) principle of relativity\u201d was welcomed as a more\nconsistent (as avoiding Newtonian absolutism) carrying through of the\ndistinction between transcendentally ideal, purely mathematical,\nconcepts of space and time and the relative physical measures\nof space and time. The relativization of time measurements, in\nparticular, showed that Kant, once shorn of the psychologistic error\nof pure intuition, correctly maintained that time is not an object of\nperception. Natorp further alleged that from this relativization it\nfollowed that events are ordered, not in relation to an absolute time,\nbut only as lawfully determined phenomena in mutual temporal relation\nto one another, a version of Leibnizian relationism. Similarly, the\nlight postulate had a two-fold significance within the Marburg\nconception of natural science. On the one hand, the uniformity of the\nvelocity of light, deemed an empirical presupposition of all\nspace- and time-measurements, reminded that absolute determinations of\nthese measures, unattainable in empirical natural science, would\nrequire a correspondingly absolute bound. Furthermore, as an upper\nlimiting velocity for physical processes, including gravitational\nforce, the light postulate eliminated the \u201cmysterious\nabsolutism\u201d of Newtonian action-at-a-distance. Natorp regarded\nthe requirement of invariance of laws of nature with respect to the\nLorentz transformations as \u201cperhaps the most important result of\nMinkowski\u2019s investigation\u201d. However, little more is said\nabout this, and there is some confusion regarding these\ntransformations and the Galilean ones they supersede; the former are\nseen as a\n\n\nbroadening (Erweiterung) of the old supposition of the\ninvariance of Newtonian mechanics for a translatory or\ncircular (zirkul\u00e4re, emphasis added) motion of\nthe world coordinates. (1910: 403)\n\n\nHe concluded with an observation that the appearance of non-Euclidean\nand multi-dimensional geometries in physics and mathematics are to be\nunderstood only as \u201cvaluable tools in the treatment of special\nproblems\u201d. In themselves, they furnish no new insight into the\n(transcendental) logical meaning and ground of the transcendental and\npurely mathematically determined concepts of space and time;\nstill less do they require the abandonment of these concepts.\n3.2 Immunizing Strategies\n\nFollowing the experimental confirmation of the general theory in 1919,\nfew Kantians attempted to retain, unadulterated, all of the components\nof Kant\u2019s epistemological views. Several examples will suffice\nto indicate characteristic \u201cimmunizing strategies\u201d\n(Hentschel 1990). The Habilitationsschrift of E. Sellien\n(1919), read by Einstein in view of his criticism expressed in an\nOctober 1919 letter to Moritz Schlick (Howard 1984: 625), declared\nthat Kant\u2019s views on space and time pertained solely to\nintuitive space; as such Kant\u2019s views were impervious to the\nmeasurable spaces and times of Einstein\u2019s empirical theory. The\nwork of another young Kantian philosopher, Ilse Schneider, personally\nknown to Einstein, affirmed that Kant merely had held that the space\nof three-dimensional Euclidean geometry is the space in which\nNewton\u2019s gravitational law is valid, thus no objections to Kant\ncould be marshalled from the four-dimensional variably curved\nspacetimes of general relativity. Furthermore, Einstein\u2019s\ncosmology (1917b) of a finite but unbounded universe was regarded as\nin complete accord with the \u201ctranscendental solution\u201d to\nthe First Antinomy in the Second Book of the Transcendental Dialectic.\nHer verdict was that apparent contradictions between relativity theory\nand Kantian philosophy disappear on closer examination of both\ndoctrines (Schneider 1921: 71\u201375).\n3.3 Rejecting or Refurbishing the Transcendental Aesthetic\n\nIn fact many Kantian philosophers did not attempt to immunize Kant\nfrom an apparent empirical refutation by the general theory. Rather,\ntheir concern was to establish how far-reaching the necessary\nmodifications of Kant must be and whether, on implementation, anything\ndistinctively Kantian remained. Certainly, most at risk appeared to be\nthe claim, in the Transcendental Aesthetic, that all objects of outer\nintuition, and so all physical objects, conform to the space of\nEuclidean geometry. Since the general theory of relativity employed\nnon-Euclidean (Riemannian) geometry for the characterization of\nphysical phenomena, the conclusion seemed inevitable that any\nassertion of the necessarily Euclidean character of physical space in\nfinite, if not infinitesimal, regions, is simply false.\n\nWinternitz (1924), an example of this tendency, may be singled out on\nthe grounds that it was deemed significant enough to be the subject of\na rare book review by Einstein (1924). Winternitz argued that the\nTranscendental Aesthetic is inextricably connected to the claim of the\nnecessarily Euclidean character of physical space and so stood in\ndirect conflict with Einstein\u2019s theory. It must accordingly be\ntotally jettisoned as a confusing and unnecessary appendage of the\nmore fundamental transcendental project of establishing the a\npriori logical presuppositions of physical knowledge. Indeed,\nthese presuppositions have been confirmed by the general theory: They\nare spatiality and temporality as \u201cunintuitive schema of\norder\u201d in general (as distinct from any particular\nchronometrical relations), the law of causality and presupposition of\ncontinuity, the principle of sufficient reason, and the conservation\nlaws. Remarkably, the necessity of each of these principles\nwas, rightly or wrongly, soon to be challenged by the new quantum\nmechanics. (The ill-fated 1924 theory of Bohr, Kramers, and Slater\nattempting to unify the classical electromagnetic field with\ndiscontinuous quantum transitions in atoms is a period challenge to\nthe law of conservation of energy.) According to Winternitz, the\nne plus ultra of transcendental idealism lay in the claim\nthat the world \u201cis not given but posed (nicht gegeben,\nsondern aufgegeben) (as a problem)\u201d out of the given\nmaterial of sensation. Interestingly, Einstein, late in life, returns\nto this formulation as comprising the fundamental Kantian insight into\nthe character of physical knowledge (1949b: 680; Ryckman 2017: chapter\n10).\n\nHowever, a number of neo-Kantian positions, of which that of Marburg\nwas only the best known, did not take the core doctrine of the\nTranscendental Aesthetic \u00e0 la lettre. Rather,\nresources broadly within it were sought for preserving an updated\n\u201ccritical idealism\u201d. In this regard, Bollert (1921) merits\nmention for its technically adroit presentation of both the special\nand the general theory. Bollert argued that relativity theory had\nclarified the Kantian position in the Transcendental Aesthetic by\ndemonstrating that not space and time, but spatiality (determinateness\nin positional ordering) and temporality (in order of succession) are\na priori conditions of physical knowledge. In so doing,\ngeneral relativity theory with its variably curved spacetime, brought\na further advance in the steps or levels of\n\u201cobjectivation\u201d lying at the basis of physics. In this\nprocess, corresponding with the growth of physical knowledge since\nGalileo, each higher level is obtained from the previous through\nelimination of subjective elements from the concept of physical\nobject. This ever-augmented revision of the conditions of objectivity\nalone is central to critical idealism. For this reason, Bollert\nclaimed it is \u201can error\u201d to believe that \u201ca\ncontradiction exists between Kantian a priorism and\nrelativity theory\u201d (1921: 64). As will be seen, these\nconclusions are quite close to those of the much more widely known\nmonograph of Cassirer (1921). It is worth noting, however, that\nBollert\u2019s interpretation of critical idealism was cited\nfavorably later by G\u00f6del (1946/9-B2: 240, n.24) during the course\nof research which led to his famous discovery of rotating universe\nsolutions to Einstein\u2019s gravitational field equations (1949).\nG\u00f6del\u2019s investigation had been prompted by curiosity\nconcerning the similar denials, in relativity theory and in Kant, of\nan absolute time.\n3.4 General Covariance: A Synthetic Principle of \u201cUnity of Determination\u201d\n\nThe most influential of all neo-Kantian interpretations of general\nrelativity was Ernst Cassirer\u2019s Zur Einsteinschen\nRelativit\u00e4tstheorie (1921). Cassirer regarded the theory as\na crucial test for Erkenntniskritik, the preferred term for\nthe epistemology of the physical sciences of Marburg\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism. The question, posed right at the beginning,\nis whether the Transcendental Aesthetic offered a foundation\n\u201cbroad enough and strong enough\u201d to bear the general\ntheory of relativity. Recognizing the theory\u2019s principal\nepistemological significance to lie in the requirement of general\ncovariance (\u201cthat the general laws of nature are not changed in\nform by arbitrary changes of the space-time variables\u201d),\nCassirer directed his attention to Einstein\u2019s remarks, cited in\n \u00a72\n above, that general covariance \u201ctakes away from space and time\nthe last remnant of physical objectivity\u201d. Cassirer correctly\nconstrued the gist of this passage to mean that in the general theory\nof relativity, space and time coordinates have no further importance\nthan to be mere labels of events (\u201ccoincidences\u201d),\nindependent variables of the mathematical (field) functions\ncharacterizing physical state magnitudes. In particular, the\nrequirement of general covariance had significantly improved upon Kant\nin bringing out far more clearly the exclusively methodological role\nof these conditions in empirical cognition, a role Kant misleadingly\nassigned to pure intuition. Not only has it has shown that space and\ntime are not \u201cthings\u201d, it has also clarified that they are\n\u201cideal principles of order\u201d applying to the objects of the\nphysical world as a necessary condition of their possible experience.\nAccording to Cassirer, Kant\u2019s intention with regard to\npure intuition was simply to express the methodological presupposition\nthat certain \u201cintellectual forms\u201d (Denkformen),\namong which are the purely ideal concepts of coexistence and\nsuccession, enter into all physical knowledge. According to the\ndevelopment of physics since the 17th century already\nchronicled in Substanzbegriff und Funktionsbegriff, these\nforms have progressively lost their \u201cfortuitous\u201d\n(zuf\u00e4lligen) anthropomorphic features, and more and more\ntake on the character of \u201csystematic forms of unity\u201d. From\nthis vantage point, general covariance is but the most recent\nrefinement of the methodological principle of \u201cunity of\ndetermination\u201d governing the constitution of objects of physical\nknowledge, notable in physics by the transition from concepts of\nsubstance into functional and relational concepts. In accord with\ncentral tenets of the Marburg Kant interpretation noted above,\nCassirer maintained that the requirement of generally covariant laws\nwas a vindication of the transcendental ideality of space and time,\nnot, indeed, as \u201cforms of intuition\u201d but as\n\u201cobjectifying conditions\u201d that further\n\u201cde-anthropomorphized\u201d the concept of object in physics,\nrendering it \u201cpurely symbolic\u201d. The fundamental concept of\nobject in physics no longer pertains to particular entities or\nprocesses propagating in space and time but rather to \u201cthe\ninvariance of relations among (physical state) magnitudes\u201d\nrepresented by generally covariant mathematical objects (tensors). For\nthis reason, Cassirer concluded, the general theory of relativity\nexhibits \u201cthe most determinate application and carrying through\nwithin empirical science of the standpoint of critical idealism\u201d\n(1921 [1957: 71; 1923: 412]).\n4. Logical Empiricism\n4.1 Lessons of Methodology?\n\nLogical empiricism\u2019s philosophy of science was conceived under\nthe guiding star of Einstein\u2019s two theories of relativity, as\nmay be seen from the early writings of its founders, for purposes\nhere, Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, and Hans Reichenbach. A small\nmonograph of Schlick, Space and Time in Contemporary Physics,\nappearing in 1917 initially in successive issues of the scientific\nweekly Die Naturwissenschaften, served as prototype. One of\nthe first of a host of philosophical examinations of the general\ntheory of relativity, it was distinguished both by the lucidity of its\nlargely non-technical physical exposition and by Einstein\u2019s\nenthusiastic praise of its philosophical appraisal, favoring\nconventionalism \u00e0 la Poincar\u00e9 over both\nneo-Kantianism and Machian positivism. The transformation of the\nconcept of space within the general theory of relativity was the\nsubject of Rudolf Carnap\u2019s dissertation at Jena in 1921.\nAppearing as a monograph in 1922, it also evinced a broadly\nconventionalist methodology combined with elements of Husserlian\ntranscendental phenomenology. Distinguishing clearly between\nintuitive, physical and purely formal conceptions of space, Carnap\nargued that, subject to the necessary constraints of certain a\npriori phenomenological conditions of the topology of intuitive\nspace, the purely formal and the physical aspects of theories of\nspace, can be adjusted to one another so as to preserve any\nconventionally chosen aspect. In turn, Hans Reichenbach was one of\nfive intrepid attendees of Einstein\u2019s first seminar on general\nrelativity given at Berlin University in the tumultuous winter of\n1918\u20131919; his detailed notebooks survive. The general theory of\nrelativity was the particular subject of Reichenbach\u2019s\nneo-Kantian first book (1920), which is dedicated to Albert Einstein,\nas well as of his next two books (1924, 1928), and of numerous papers\nin the 1920s.\n\nBut Einstein\u2019s theories of relativity provided far more than the\nsubject matter for these philosophical examinations. Logical\nempiricist philosophy of science itself was fashioned by\nlessons allegedly drawn from relativity theory in correcting or\nrebutting both neo-Kantian and Machian perspectives on general\nmethodological and epistemological questions of science. Several of\nthe most characteristic doctrines of logical empiricist philosophy of\nscience\u2014the interpretation of a priori elements in\nphysical theories as conventions, the treatment of the necessary role\nof conventions in linking theoretical concepts to observation, the\ninsistence on observational language definition of theoretical\nterms\u2014were taken to have been conclusively demonstrated by\nEinstein in fashioning his two theories of relativity. As mentioned\nabove, Einstein\u2019s 1905 analysis of the conventionality of\nsimultaneity in the special theory of relativity became a\nmethodological paradigm for logical empiricism; it prompted\nReichenbach\u2019s own method of \u201clogical analysis\u201d of\nphysical theories into subjective (definitional, conventional) and\nobjective (empirical) components. An overriding concern in the logical\nempiricist treatment of relativity theory was to draw broad lessons\nfor scientific methodology and philosophy of science generally,\nalthough issues more specific to the philosophy of physics were also\naddressed. Only the former are considered here; for a discussion of\nthe latter, see Ryckman 2007.\n4.2 From the \u201cRelativized A priori\u201d to the \u201cRelativity of Geometry\u201d\n\nA cornerstone of Reichenbach\u2019s logical analysis of the theory of\ngeneral relativity is the thesis of \u201cthe relativity of\ngeometry\u201d, that an arbitrary geometry may be ascribed to\nspacetime (holding constant the underlying topology) if the laws of\nphysics are correspondingly modified through the introduction of\n\u201cuniversal forces\u201d. This particular argument for metric\nconventionalism has generated substantial controversy on its own, but\nis better understood through an account of its genesis in\nReichenbach\u2019s early neo-Kantianism. Independently of that\ngenesis, the thesis becomes the paradigmatic illustration of\nReichenbach\u2019s broad methodological claim that conventional or\ndefinitional elements\u2014\u201ccoordinative definitions\u201d\nassociating mathematical concepts of the physical theory with\n\u201celements of physical reality\u201d\u2014are a necessary\ncondition for empirical cognition in the mathematical sciences of\nnature. At the same time, Reichenbach\u2019s thesis of metrical\nconventionalism is part and parcel of an audacious program of\nepistemological reductionism regarding spacetime structures. This was\nfirst attempted in his \u201cconstructive axiomatization\u201d\n(1924) of the theory of relativity on the basis of \u201celementary\nmatters of fact\u201d (Elementartatbestande) regarding the\nobservable behavior of lights rays, and rods and clocks. Here, and in\nthe more widely read treatment (1928), metrical properties of\nspacetime are deemed less fundamental than topological ones, while the\nlatter are derived from the concept of time ordering. But time order\nin turn is reduced to that of causal order and so the whole edifice of\nstructures of spacetime is considered epistemologically derivative,\nresting upon ultimately basic empirical facts about causal order and a\nprohibition against action-at-a-distance. The end point of\nReichenbach\u2019s epistemological analysis of the foundations of\nspacetime theory is then \u201cthe causal theory of time\u201d, a\ntype of relational theory of time that assumes the validity of the\ncausal principle of action-by-contact\n(Nahewirkungsprinzip).\n\nHowever, Reichenbach\u2019s first monograph on relativity (1920) was\nwritten from within a neo-Kantian perspective. As Friedman (1994) and\nothers (Ryckman 2005) have discussed in detail Reichenbach\u2019s\ninnovation, a modification of the Kantian conception of synthetic\na priori principles, rejecting the sense of \u201cvalid for all\ntime\u201d while retaining that of \u201cconstitutive of the object\n(of knowledge)\u201d, led to the conception of a theory-specific\n\u201crelativized a priori\u201d. According to Reichenbach,\nany physical theory presupposes the validity of systems of certain,\nquite general, principles which however may vary from theory to\ntheory. These coordinating principles, as they are then\ntermed, are indispensable for the ordering of perceptual data; they\ndefine the objects of knowledge within the theory. The epistemological\nsignificance of relativity theory, according to the early Reichenbach,\nis to have shown, contrary to Kant, that these systems may contain\nmutually inconsistent principles, and so require emendation to remove\ncontradictions. Thus a \u201crelativization\u201d of the Kantian\nconception of synthetic a priori principles is the direct\nepistemological result of the theory of relativity. But this finding\nis also taken to signal a transformation in the method of\nepistemological investigation of science. In place of Kant\u2019s\n\u201canalysis of Reason\u201d, \u201cthe method of analysis of\nscience\u201d (der wissenschaftsanalytische Methode) is\nproposed as \u201cthe only way that affords us an understanding of\nthe contribution of our reason to knowledge\u201d (1920: 71 [1965:\n74]). The method\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to\nsharply distinguish between the subjective role of (coordinating)\nprinciples\u2014\u201cthe contribution of Reason\u201d\u2014and\nthe contribution of objective reality, represented by theory-specific\nempirical laws and regularities (\u201caxioms of connection\u201d)\nwhich in some sense have been \u201cconstituted\u201d by the former.\nRelativity theory itself is a shining exemplar of this method for it\nhas shown that the metric of spacetime describes an \u201cobjective\nproperty\u201d of the world, once the subjective freedom to make\ncoordinate transformations (the coordinating principle of general\ncovariance) is recognized (1920: 86\u20137 [1965: 90]). The thesis of\nmetric conventionalism had yet to appear.\n\nBut soon it did. Still in 1920, Schlick objected, both publicly and in\nprivate correspondence with Reichenbach, that \u201cprinciples of\ncoordination\u201d were precisely statements of the kind that\nPoincar\u00e9 had termed \u201cconventions\u201d (see Coffa 1991:\n201ff.). Moreover, Einstein, in a lecture of January 1921, entitled\n\u201cGeometry and Experience\u201d, appeared to lend support to\nthis view. Einstein argued that the question concerning the nature of\nspacetime geometry becomes an empirical question only on certain\npro tem stipulations regarding the \u201cpractically rigid\nbody\u201d of measurement (pro tem in view of the\ninadmissibility in relativity theory of the concept \u201cactually\nrigid body\u201d). In any case, by 1922, the essential pieces of\nReichenbach\u2019s mature conventionalist view had emerged. The\nargument is canonically presented in \u00a78 (entitled \u201cThe\nRelativity of Geometry\u201d) of Der Philosophie der\nRaum-Zeit-Lehre (completed in 1926, published in 1928). In a move\nsuperficially similar to the argument of Einstein\u2019s\n\u201cGeometry and Experience\u201d, Reichenbach maintained that\nquestions concerning the empirical determination of the metric of\nspacetime must first confront the fact that only the whole theoretical\nedifice comprising both geometry and physics admits of observational\ntest. Einstein\u2019s gravitational theory is such a totality.\nHowever, unlike Einstein, Reichenbach\u2019s \u201cmethod of\nanalysis of science\u201d, later re-named \u201clogical analysis of\nscience\u201d, is directed to the epistemological problem of\nfactoring this totality into its conventional or definitional and its\nempirical components.\n\nThis is done as follows. The empirical determination of the spacetime\nmetric by measurement requires choice of some \u201cmetrical\nindicators\u201d: this can only be done by laying down a\ncoordinative definition stipulating, e.g., that the metrical\nnotion of length is coordinated to some physical object or process. A\nstandard choice coordinates lengths with \u201cinfinitesimal\nmeasuring rods\u201d supposed rigid (e.g., Einstein\u2019s\n\u201cpractically rigid body\u201d). This however is only a\nconvention, and other physical objects or processes might be chosen.\n(In Schlick\u2019s fanciful example, the Dali Lama\u2019s heartbeat\ncould be chosen as the physical process to which units of time are\ncoordinated.) Of course, the chosen metrical indicators must be\ncorrected for certain distorting effects (temperature, magnetism,\netc.) due to the presence of physical forces. Such forces are termed\n\u201cdifferential forces\u201d to indicate that they affect various\nmaterials differently. However, Reichenbach argued, the choice of a\nrigid rod as standard of length is tantamount to the claim that there\nare no non-differential\u2014\u201cuniversal\u201d\u2014distorting\nforces that affect all bodies in the same way and cannot be screened\noff. In the absence of \u201cuniversal forces\u201d the coordinative\ndefinition regarding rigid rods can be implemented and the nature of\nthe spacetime metric empirically determined, for example, finding that\npaths of light rays through solar gravitational field are not\nEuclidean straight lines. Thus, the theory of general relativity, on\nadoption of the coordinative definition of rigid rods\n(\u201cuniversal forces = 0\u201d), affirms that the geometry of\nspacetime in a given region is of a non-euclidean kind. The point,\nhowever, is that this conclusion rests on the convention governing\nmeasuring rods. One could, alternately, maintain that the geometry of\nspacetime was Euclidean by adopting a different coordinative\ndefinition, for example, holding that measuring rods expanded or\ncontracted depending on their location in spacetime, a choice\ntantamount to the supposition of \u201cuniversal forces\u201d. Then,\nconsistent with all empirical phenomena, it could be maintained that\nEuclidean geometry was compatible with Einstein\u2019s theory if only\none allowed the existence of such forces. Thus whether general\nrelativity affirms a Euclidean or a non-euclidean metric in the solar\ngravitational field rests upon a conventional choice regarding the\nexistence of non-zero universal forces. Either hypothesis may be\nadopted since they are empirically equivalent descriptions; their\njoint possibility is referred to as \u201cthe relativity of\ngeometry\u201d. Just as with the choice of standard synchrony in\nReichenbach\u2019s analysis of the conventionality of simultaneity, a\nchoice also held to be \u201clogically arbitrary\u201d, Reichenbach\nrecommends the \u201cdescriptively simpler\u201d alternative in\nwhich universal forces do not exist. To be sure, \u201c descriptive\nsimplicity has nothing to do with truth\u201d, i.e., has no bearing\non the question of whether the spacetime metric really has a\nnon-Euclidean structure (1928: 47 [1958: 35]).\n4.3 Critique of Reichenbachian Metric Conventionalism\n\nIn retrospect, it is rather difficult to understand the significance\nthat has been accorded this argument. Carnap, for example, in\n\u201cIntroductory Remarks\u201d (Carnap 1956 [Reichenbach 1958:\nvii]) to the posthumous English translation of this work, singled it\nout on account of its \u201cgreat interest for the methodology of\nphysics\u201d. Reichenbach himself deemed \u201cthe philosophical\nachievement of the theory of relativity\u201d to lie in this\nmethodological distinction between conventional and factual claims\nregarding spacetime geometry (1928: 24 [1958: 15]), and he boasted of\nhis \u201cphilosophical theory of relativity\u201d as an\nincontrovertible \u201cphilosophical result\u201d:\n\n\nthe philosophical theory of relativity, i.e., the discovery\nof the definitional character of the metric in all its details, holds\nindependently of experience.\u2026 a philosophical result not\nsubject to the criticism of the individual sciences. (1928: 223 [1958:\n177])\n\n\nYet this result is neither incontrovertible nor an untrammeled\nconsequence of Einstein\u2019s theory of gravitation. There is, first\nof all, the shadowy status accorded to universal forces. A sympathetic\nreading (e.g., Dieks 1987) suggests that the notion serves usefully in\nmediating between a traditional a priori commitment to\nEuclidean geometry and the view of modern geometrodynamics, where\ngravitational force is \u201cgeometrized away\u201d (see\n \u00a75).\n After all, as Reichenbach explicitly acknowledged, gravitation is\nitself a universal force, coupling to all bodies and affecting them in\nthe same manner (1928: 294\u20136 [1958: 256\u20138]). Hence the\nchoice recommended by descriptive simplicity is merely a stipulation\nthat infinitesimal metrical appliances be considered as\n\u201cdifferentially at rest\u201d in an inertial system (1924: 115\n[1969: 147]). This is a stipulation that spacetime measurements always\ntake place in regions that are to be considered small Minkowski\nspacetimes (arenas of gravitation-free physics). By the same token,\nconsistency then required an admission that \u201cthe transition from\nthe special theory to the general one represents merely a renunciation\nof metrical characteristics\u201d (1924: 115 [1969: 147]), or, even\nmore pointedly, that \u201call the metrical properties of the\nspacetime continuum are destroyed by gravitational fields\u201d where\nonly topological properties remain (1928: 308 [1958: 268\u20139]). To\nbe sure, these bizarre conclusions are supposed to be rendered more\npalatable in connection with the epistemological reduction of\nspacetime structures in the causal theory of time.\n\nDespite the influence of this argument on the subsequent generation of\nphilosophers of science, Reichenbach\u2019s analysis of spacetime\nmeasurement is plainly inappropriate, manifesting a fallacious\ntendency to view the generically curved spacetimes of general\nrelativity as stitched together from little bits of flat Minskowski\nspacetimes. Besides being mathematically inconsistent, this procedure\noffers no way of providing a non-metaphorical physical meaning for the\nfundamental metrical tensor \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\), the central theoretical\nconcept of general relativity, nor to the series of curvature tensors\nderivable from it and its associated affine connection. Since these\nsectional curvatures at a point of spacetime are empirically\nmanifested and the curvature components can be measured, e.g., as the\ntidal forces of gravity, they can hardly be accounted as due to\nconventionally adopted \u201cuniversal forces\u201d. Furthermore,\nthe concept of an infinitesimal rigid rod in general relativity cannot\nreally be other than the interim stopgap Einstein recognized it to be.\nFor it cannot actually be rigid due to these tidal forces; in fact,\nthe concept of a rigid body is already forbidden in special relativity\nas allowing instantaneous causal actions. Moreover, such a rod must\nindeed be infinitesimal, i.e., a freely falling body of negligible\nthickness and of sufficiently short extension, so as to not be\nstressed by gravitational field inhomogeneities; just how short\ndepending on strength of local curvatures and on measurement error\n(Torretti 1983: 239). But then, as Reichenbach appeared to have\nrecognized in his comments about the \u201cdestruction\u201d of the\nmetric by gravitational fields, it cannot serve as a coordinately\ndefined general standard for metrical relations. In fact, as Weyl was\nthe first to point out, precisely which physical objects or structures\nare most suitable as measuring instruments should be decided on the\nbasis of gravitational theory itself. From this enlightened\nperspective, measuring rods and clocks are structures that are far too\nphysically complex. Rather, the metric in the region surrounding any\nobserver O can be empirically determined from freely falling ideally\nsmall neutral test masses together with the paths of light rays. More\nprecisely stated, the spacetime metric results from the\naffine-projective structure of the behavior of neutral test particles\nof negligible mass and from the conformal structure of light rays\nreceived and issued by the observer (Weyl 1921). Any purely\nconventional stipulation regarding the behavior of measuring rods as\nphysically constitutive of metrical relations in general relativity is\nthen otiose (Weyl 1923a; Ehlers, Pirani and Schild 1973; Geroch 1978).\nAlas, since Reichenbach reckoned the affine structure of the\ngravitational-inertial field to be just as conventional as its\nmetrical structure, he was not able to recognize this method as other\nthan an equivalent, but by no means necessarily preferable, account of\nthe empirical determination of the metric through the use of rods and\nclocks (Coffa 1979; Ryckman 2005: chs. 2 & 4; Giovanelli\n2013b).\n5. \u201cGeometrization of Physics\u201d: Platonism, Transcendental Idealism, Structuralism\n5.1 Differing Motivations\n\nIn the decade or so following the appearance of the general theory of\nrelativity, there was much talk of a reduction of physics to geometry\n(e.g., Hilbert 1917; Weyl 1918b, 1919; Haas 1920; Lodge 1921). While\nthese discussions were largely, and understandably, confined to\nscientific circles, they nonetheless brought distinctly philosophical\nissues\u2014of methodology, but also of epistemology and\nmetaphysics\u2014together with technical matters. Einstein\u2019s\nmathematical representation of gravitational field potentials by the\nmetric tensor \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) of a variably curved spacetime geometry\nwas quickly termed a \u201cgeometrization of gravitational\nforce\u201d. Weyl and others acclaimed Einstein as reviving a\ngeometrizing tendency essentially dormant within physics since the\n17th century. In so doing, Einstein supposedly opened up the prospect\nof a complete geometrization of physical theory, the possibility of\nfinding a unifying representation of all of known physical\ninteractions within the frame of a unique metrical theory of the\nfour-dimensional spacetime continuum. Einstein himself, as will be\nseen, turned out to be highly critical of the idea of\n\u201cgeometrizing physics\u201d even as the general theory of\nrelativity was its inspiration. This was certainly the case for the\nG\u00f6ttingen mathematician David Hilbert (1915, 1917). In the very\nweek in late November 1915 when Einstein presented his completed\ngravitational theory to the Berlin Academy (on Thursday), Hilbert (the\nprevious Monday) proposed to the G\u00f6ttingen Academy a schematic\ngenerally covariant axiomatization coupling Einstein\u2019s\ngravitational theory with a relativistic electromagnetic theory of\nmatter due to German physicist Gustav Mie. Hilbert\u2019s theory\ncould not possibly succeed (however, that matter is not fundamentally\nelectromagnetic in nature was only shown in the 1930s by the quantum\nphysics of the atomic nucleus). It is remembered today mostly for the\nso-called \u201cEinstein-Hilbert action\u201d in the usual\nvariational formulation of Einstein\u2019s theory. But at the time\nHilbert viewed his theory as a triumph of his \u201caxiomatic\nmethod\u201d as well as a demonstration that\n\n\nphysics is a four-dimensional pseudogeometry [i.e., a geometry\ndistinguishing spatial and temporal dimensions] whose metric\ndetermination \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is bound, according to the fundamental\nequations \u2026 of my first [1915] contribution, to the\nelectromagnetic quantities, that is, to matter. (1917: 63, translation\nby the author)\n\n\nHowever, this implied reduction of physics to geometry was crucially\nobtained within the epistemological frame of what Hilbert termed\n\u201cthe axiomatic method\u201d; its intended significance is that\nof a proposed solution to the 6th (\u201cthe axiomatization of\nphysics\u201d) of the famous 23 mathematical problems posed by\nHilbert at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris\n(Brading & Ryckman 2008). Others pursued a different path, seeking\nthe reduction of physics to geometry by generalizing beyond the\npseudo-Riemannian geometry (a Riemannian geometry distinguishing\nbetween space and time dimensions) of general relativity (Hermann\nWeyl, Arthur Stanley Eddington) or by employing Riemannian geometry in\nfive dimensions (Theodore Kaluza). Whatever may have been\nKaluza\u2019s philosophical motivations (van Dongen 2010:\n132\u20135), neither mathematical realism nor Platonism played a role\nin Weyl\u2019s (1918a,b), and following Weyl, Eddington\u2019s\n(1921) generalizations of Riemannian geometry. Their proposals were\nabove all explicit attempts to comprehend the nature of fundamental\nphysical theory in the light of general relativity, from systematic\nepistemological standpoints neither positivist nor realist. As such\nthey comprise early philosophical interpretations of that theory,\nalthough they intertwine philosophy, geometry and physics in a manner\nunprecedented since Descartes.\n\nAfter completing general relativity, Einstein long entertained hopes\nthat matter might be described in geometrical terms by a theory\nunifying gravitation and electromagnetism. But he stoutly and\nrepeatedly resisted proclamations of any reduction of physics to\ngeometry (e.g., 1928: 254; Giovanelli 2013a). Theoretical unification\nwas overriding goal; no special significance would accrue to any\nsuccessful unifying theory whose physical objects, motions, and\ninteractions are described in geometrical terms (Lehmkuhl 2014).\nEinstein nonetheless followed both approaches to theoretical\nunification, that of generalizing Riemannian geometry and by adding\nextra dimensions. By 1923, Einstein was the recognized leader of the\nunification program (Vizgin 1985 [1994: 265]) and by 1925 had devised\nhis first \u201chomegrown\u201d geometrical \u201cunified field\ntheories\u201d (Sauer 2014). The first phase of the geometrical\nunification program essentially ended with Einstein\u2019s\n\u201cdistant parallelism\u201d theory of 1928\u20131931 (e.g.,\n1929), an inadvertent public sensation (F\u00f6lsing 1993 [1997:\n605]). Needless to say, none of these efforts met with success. In a\nlecture at the University of Vienna on October 14, 1931, Einstein\nforlornly referred to his failed attempts, each conceived on a\ndistinct differential geometrical basis, as a \u201cgraveyard of dead\nhopes\u201d (Einstein 1932). By this time, certainly, the viable\nprospects for the geometrical unification program had considerably\nwaned. A consensus emerged among nearly all leading theoretical\nphysicists that while unification of the gravitation and\nelectromagnetic fields might be attained in formally distinct ways,\nthe problem of matter, treated with undeniable empirical success by\nthe new quantum theory, was not to be resolved solely within the\nconfines of classical fields and spacetime geometry. In any event,\nfrom the early 1930s, prospects of any type of unification program\nappeared greatly premature in view of the wealth of data produced by\nthe new physics of the nucleus.\n\nStill, unsuccessful pursuit of the goal of geometrical unification\nabsorbed Einstein and his various research assistants for more than\nthree decades, up to Einstein\u2019s death in 1955. In the course of\nit, Einstein\u2019s research methodology underwent a dramatic change\n(Ryckman 2014; Ryckman 2017: chapters 9 and 10). In place of\nphysically warranted principles to guide theoretical construction,\nsuch as the equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass that\nhad set him on the path to his greatest success with general\nrelativity, Einstein increasingly relied on considerations of\nmathematical aesthetics, of \u201clogical simplicity\u201d, and the\ninevitability of certain mathematical structures under various\nconstraints, adopted essentially for philosophical reasons. In a talk\nentitled \u201cOn the Method of Theoretical Physics\u201d at Oxford\nin 1933, the transformation was stated dramatically:\n\n\nExperience remains, of course, the sole criterion of the physical\nutility of a mathematical construction. But the creative principle\nresides in mathematics. In a certain sense, therefore, I hold it true\nthat pure thought can grasp reality, as the ancients dreamed. (1933:\n274)\n\n\nEven decades of accumulating empirical successes of the new quantum\ntheory did not dislodge Einstein\u2019s core metaphysical conception\nof physical reality as a continuous field (\u201ctotal field\u201d)\nwhere particles and the concept of motion are derived notions (e.g.,\n1950: 348).\n5.2 The Initial Step: \u201cGeometrizing\u201d Gravity\n\nThe \u201cgeometrization of gravitational force\u201d in 1915 gave\nthe geometrization program its first, partial, realization as well as\nits subsequent impetus. In Einstein\u2019s theory, the fundamental or\n\u201cmetric\u201d tensor \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) of Riemannian geometry\nappears in a dual role which thoroughly fuses its geometrical and its\nphysical meanings. As is apparent from the expression for the\ndifferential interval between neighboring spacetime events,\n\\(\\textit{ds}^{2}= g_{\\mu\\nu} \\textit{dx}^{\\mu} \\textit{dx}^{\\nu}\\)\n(here, and below there is an implicit summation over repeated upper\nand lower indices), the metric tensor is at once the geometrical\nquantity underlying measurable metrical relations of lengths and\ntimes. In this role it ties a mathematical theory of events in\nfour-dimensional curved spacetime to observations and measurements in\nspace and time. But it is also the potential of the gravitational (or\n\u201cmetrical\u201d) field whose value, at any point of spacetime\narises as a solution of the Einstein Field Equations (see below) for\ngiven physical quantities of mass-momentum-stress in the immediate\nsurrounding region. In the new view, the idea of strength of\ngravitational force is replaced by that of degree of spacetime\ncurvature. This curvature is manifested, for example, by the tidal\nforce of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field that occasions two\nfreely falling bodies, released at a certain height and at fixed\nseparation, to approach one another. A freely falling body (ideally,\nan uncharged test particle of negligible mass) in a gravitational\nfield follows a geodesic path (that is, a curve of extremal length in\na generally curved pseudo-Riemannian spacetime). The body is no longer\nto be regarded as moving through space according to the pull of an\nattractive gravitational force, but simply as tracing out the laziest\n(longest or slowest possible) four-dimensional trajectory between two\nfinitely separated spacetime events. In consequence, in general\nrelativity the equation of motion of a free body is a geodesic\nequation according to which the body\u2019s spacetime (four-)\nacceleration vanishes identically and its free fall becomes\nindistinguishable from inertial motion. According to this equation, a\nfree body moves on a geodesic path in both the presence and\nabsence of a gravitational field. This is possible because\nthe equation contains a multi-index term (not a tensor) called a\nconnection allowing a gravitational field to appear or not\naccording to a given choice of spacetime coordinates. As a result, in\ngeneral relativity there is no observer-independent (coordinate-free)\nway to partition the combined inertial-gravitational field into its\nseparate components. The gross mechanical properties of bodies,\ncomprising all gravitational-inertial phenomena, can be derived as the\nsolution of a single linked system of ten generally covariant partial\ndifferential equations, the Einstein equations. According to these\nequations, spacetime and matter stand in dynamical interaction. One\nabbreviate way of characterizing the dual role of the \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\)\nis to say that in the general theory of relativity, gravitation, which\nincludes mechanics, has become geometrized, i.e.,\nincorporated into the geometry of spacetime. Yet Einstein objected to\nclaims that in general relativity gravitation is reduced to\ngeometry as that statement\u2019s natural interpretation severs the\nunification of inertia and gravitation that to Einstein comprised the\ntheory\u2019s core achievement.\n5.3 Extending Geometrization\n\nIn making spacetime curvature dependent on distributions of mass and\nenergy, general relativity is indeed capable of encompassing all\n(non-quantum) physical fields. However, in classical general\nrelativity there remains a fundamental asymmetry between gravitational\nand non-gravitational fields, in particular, electromagnetism, the\nonly other fundamental physical interaction definitely known until the\n1930s. This shows up visibly in one form of the Einstein field\nequations in which, on the left-hand side, a geometrical object\n(\\(G_{\\mu\\nu}\\), the Einstein tensor) built up from the uniquely\ncompatible linear symmetric (\u201cLevi-Civita\u201d) connection\nassociated with the metric tensor \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\), and representing the\ncurvature of spacetime, is set identical to a tensorial but\nnon-geometrical phenomenological representation of matter on the\nright-hand side. \n\n\\[ G_{\\mu\\nu} = k T_{\\mu\\nu}, \\textrm{ where } G_{\\mu\\nu} \\equiv R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\mu\\nu} R \\]\n\n\nThe expression on the right side, introduced by a coupling term that\ncontains Newton\u2019s gravitational constant, mathematically\nrepresents the non-gravitational sources of the gravitational field in\na region of spacetime in the form of a stress-energy-momentum tensor\n(an \u201comnium gatherum\u201d in Eddington\u2019s (1919:\n63) pithy phrase). As the geometry of spacetime principally resides on\nthe left-hand side, this situation seems unsatisfactory. Late in life,\nEinstein likened his famous equation to a building, one wing of which\n(the left) was built of \u201cfine marble\u201d, the other (the\nright) of \u201clow grade wood\u201d (1936: 311). In its classical\nform, general relativity accords only the gravitational field a direct\ngeometrical significance; the other physical fields reside in\nspacetime; they are not of spacetime.\n\nEinstein\u2019s dissatisfaction with this asymmetrical state of\naffairs was palpable at an early stage and was expressed with\nincreasing frequency beginning in the early 1920s. A particularly\nvivid declaration of the need for geometrical unification was made in\nhis \u201cNobel lecture\u201d of July 1923:\n\n\nThe mind striving after unification of the theory cannot be satisfied\nthat two fields should exist which, by their nature, are quite\nindependent. A mathematically unified field theory is sought in which\nthe gravitational field and the electromagnetic field are interpreted\nas only different components or manifestations of the same uniform\nfield,\u2026 The gravitational theory, considered in terms of\nmathematical formalism, i.e., Riemannian geometry, should be\ngeneralized so that it includes the laws of the electromagnetic field.\n(489)\n\n\nIt might be noted that the tacit assumption, evident here, that\nincorporation of electromagnetism into spacetime geometry requires a\ngeneralization of the Riemannian geometry of general relativity;\nthough widely held at the time, it is not quite correct (Rainich 1925;\nMisner & Wheeler 1957; Geroch 1966).\n5.4 \u201cPure Infinitesimal Geometry\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Einstein, but the mathematician Hermann Weyl who first\naddressed the asymmetry in 1918 in the course of reconstructing\nEinstein\u2019s theory on the preferred epistemological basis of a\n\u201cpure infinitesimal geometry\u201d (Reine\nInfinitesimalgeometrie). Holding that\ndirect\u2014evident, in the sense of the\nWesensschau of Husserlian phenomenoloy\u2014comparisons of\nlength or duration could be made at near-by points of spacetime, but\nnot, as the Riemannian geometry of Einstein\u2019s theory allowed,\n\u201cat a distance\u201d, Weyl discovered an expanded geometry with\nadditional terms that, following Einstein\u2019s example, he simply\nformally identified with the potentials of the electromagnetic field.\nFrom these, the electromagnetic field strengths can be immediately\nderived. Choosing an action integral to obtain both the homogeneous\nand the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations as well as Einstein\u2019s\ngravitational theory, Weyl could express electromagnetism as well as\ngravitation solely within the confines of a spacetime geometry. As no\nother interactions were definitely known to occur, Weyl proudly\ndeclared that the concepts of geometry and physics were the same.\nHence, everything in the physical world was a manifestation of\nspacetime geometry.\n\n\n(The) distinction between geometry and physics is an error, physics\nextends not at all beyond geometry: the world is a \\((3+1)\\)\ndimensional metrical manifold, and all physical phenomena transpiring\nin it are only modes of expression of the metric field, \u2026.\n(M)atter itself is dissolved in \u201cmetric\u201d and is not\nsomething substantial that in addition exists \u201cin\u201d metric\nspace. (1919: 115\u2013116, translation by the author)\n\n\nBy the winter of 1919\u20131920, for both physical and philosophical\nreasons (the latter having to do with his largely positive reaction to\nBrouwer\u2019s intuitionist views about the mathematical continuum,\nin particular, the continuum of spacetime\u2014see Mancosu &\nRyckman 2005), Weyl (1920) surrendered the belief, expressed here,\nthat matter, with its corpuscular structure, might be derived within\nspacetime geometry. Thus he gave up the Holy Grail of the nascent\nunified field theory program almost before it had begun. Nonetheless,\nhe actively defended his theory well into the 1920s, essentially on\nthe grounds of Husserlian transcendental phenomenology, that his\ngeometry and its central principle, \u201cthe epistemological\nprinciple of relativity of magnitude\u201d comprised a superior\nepistemological framework for general relativity. Weyl\u2019s\npostulate of a \u201cpure infinitesimal\u201d non-Riemannian metric\nfor spacetime allowed the \u201cgauge\u201d (by which Weyl meant a\nscale of length; the term has a different meaning today) to vary at\neach spacetime point. But it met with intense criticism. No\nobservation spoke in favor of it; to the contrary, Einstein pointed\nout that according to Weyl\u2019s theory, the atomic spectra of the\nchemical elements should not be stable, as indeed they are observed to\nbe. Although Weyl responded to this objection forcefully, and with\nsome subtlety (Weyl 1923a), he was able to persuade neither Einstein,\nnor any other leading relativity physicist, with the exception of\nEddington. However, the idea of requiring gauge invariance of\nfundamental physical laws was revived and vindicated by Weyl himself\nin a different form later on (Weyl 1929; see Ryckman 2005: chs. 5\n& 6; O\u2019Raifeartaigh 1997; Scholz 2001, 2004; Afriat 2017,\nOther Internet Resources).\n5.5 Eddington\u2019s World Geometry\n\nDespite failure to win many friends for his theory, Weyl\u2019s\nguiding example of unification launched the geometrical program of\nunified field theory, initiating a variety of efforts, all aimed at\nfinding a suitable generalization of the Riemannian geometry of\nEinstein\u2019s theory to encompass as well non-gravitational physics\n(Vizgin 1985 [1994: chapter 4]). In December 1921, the Berlin Academy\npublished Theodore Kaluza\u2019s novel proposal for unification of\ngravitation and electromagnetism upon the basis of a five-dimensional\nRiemannian geometry. But earlier that year, in February, came Arthur\nStanley Eddington\u2019s further generalization of Weyl\u2019s\nfour-dimensional geometry, wherein the sole primitive geometrical\nnotion is the non-metrical comparison of direction or orientation at\nthe same or neighboring points. In Weyl\u2019s geometry the magnitude\nof vectors at the same point, but pointing in different directions,\nmight be directly compared to one another; in Eddington\u2019s,\ncomparison was immediate only for vectors pointing in the same\ndirection. His \u201ctheory of the affine field\u201d encompassed\nboth Weyl\u2019s geometry and the semi-Riemannian geometry of\nEinstein\u2019s general relativity as special cases. Little attention\nwas paid however, to Eddington\u2019s claim, prefacing his paper,\nthat his objective had not been to \u201cseek (the) unknown laws (of\nmatter)\u201d as befits a unified field theory. Rather it lay\n\u201cin consolidating the known (field) laws\u201d wherein\n\u201cthe whole scheme seems simplified, and new light is thrown on\nthe origin of the fundamental laws of physics\u201d (1921: 105).\n\nEddington was persuaded that Weyl\u2019s \u201cprinciple of\nrelativity of length\u201d was \u201can essential part of the\nrelativistic conception\u201d, a view he retained to the end of his\nlife (e.g., 1939: 28). But he was also convinced that the largely\nantagonistic reception accorded Weyl\u2019s theory was due to its\nconfusing formulation. The flaw lay in Weyl\u2019s failure to make\ntransparently obvious that the locally scale invariant (\u201cpure\ninfinitesimal\u201d) \u201cworld geometry\u201d was not the\nphysical geometry of actual spacetime, but an entirely mathematical\nconstruct inherently serving to specify the ideal of an\nobserver-independent external world. To remedy this, Eddington devised\na general method of deductive presentation of field physics in which\n\u201cworld geometry\u201d is developed mathematically as\nconceptually separate from physics. A \u201cworld geometry\u201d is\na purely mathematical construction the derived objects of which\npossess only structural properties requisite to the ideal of a\ncompletely impersonal world; these are objects, as he wrote in\nSpace, Time and Gravitation (1920), a semi-popular\nbest-seller, represented \u201cfrom the point of view of no one in\nparticular\u201d. Naturally, this ideal had changed with the progress\nof physical theory. In the light of relativity theory, such a world is\nindifferent to specification of reference frame and, after Weyl, of\ngauge of length (scale). A world geometry is not the physical theory\nof such a world but a framework or \u201cgraphical\nrepresentation\u201d within whose terms existing physical theory\nmight be displayed, essentially through a purely formal identification\nof known tensors of the existing physical laws of gravitation and\nelectromagnetism with those derived within the world geometry. Such a\ngeometrical representation of physics cannot really be said to be\nright or wrong, for it only implements, if it can, current ideas\ngoverning the conception of objects and properties of an impersonal\nobjective external world. But when existing physics, in particular,\nEinstein\u2019s theory of gravitation, is set in the context of\nEddington\u2019s world geometry, it yields a surprising consequence:\nThe Einstein law of gravitation appears as a definition! In the form\n\\(R_{\\mu\\nu} = 0\\) it defines what in the \u201cworld geometry\u201d\nappears to the mind as \u201cvacuum\u201d while in the form of the\nEinstein field equation noted above, it defines what is to be\nencountered by the mind as \u201cmatter\u201d. This result is what\nis meant by his stated claim of throwing \u201cnew light on the\norigin of the fundamental laws of physics\u201d (see Ryckman 2005:\nchapters 7 & 8). Eddington\u2019s notoriously difficult and\nopaque later works (1936, 1946), took their inspiration from this\nargumentation in attempting to carry out a similar, algebraic not\ngeometric, program of deriving fundamental physical laws, and the\nconstants occurring in them, from a priori epistemological\nprinciples.\n5.6 Meyerson on \u201cPangeometrism\u201d\n\nWithin physics the idealist currents lying behind the world geometries\nof Weyl and Eddington were largely ignored, whereas within philosophy,\nwith the notable exception of \u00c9mile Meyerson\u2019s La\nD\u00e9duction Relativiste (1925). Meyerson, who had no doubt\nconcerning the basic realist impetus of science, carefully\ndistinguished Einstein\u2019s \u201crational deduction of the\nphysical world\u201d from the speculative geometrical unifications of\ngravitation and electromagnetism of Weyl and Eddington. These\ntheories, as affirmations of a complete panmathematicism, or\nrather of a pangeometrism (1925: \u00a7\u00a7 157\u201358),\nwere compared to the rationalist deductions of Hegel\u2019s\nLogic. That general relativity succeeded in partly realizing\nDescartes\u2019 program of reducing the physical to the spatial\nthrough geometric deduction, is due to the fact that Einstein\n\u201cfollowed in the footsteps\u201d of Descartes, not Hegel (1925:\n\u00a7133). But pan-geometrism is also capable of\noverreaching itself and this is the transgression committed by both\nWeyl and Eddington. Weyl in particular is singled out for criticism\nfor seemingly to have reverted to Hegel\u2019s monistic idealism, and\nso to be subject to its fatal flaw. In regarding nature as completely\nintelligible, Weyl had abolished the thing-in-itself and so promoted\nthe identity of self and non-self, the great error of the\nNaturphilosophien.\n\nThough he had \u201call due respect to the writings of such\ndistinguished scientists\u201d as Weyl and Eddington, Meyerson took\ntheir overt affirmations of idealism to be misguided attempts\n\u201cto associate themselves with a philosophical point of view that\nis in fact quite foreign to the relativistic doctrine\u201d (1925:\n\u00a7150). That \u201cpoint of view\u201d is in fact two distinct\nspecies of transcendental idealism. It is above all\n\u201cforeign\u201d to relativity theory because Meyerson cannot see\nhow it is possible to \u201creintegrate the four-dimensional world of\nrelativity theory into the self\u201d. After all, Kant\u2019s own\nargument for Transcendental Idealism proceeded \u201cin a single\nstep\u201d, in establishing the subjectivity of the space and time of\n\u201cour na\u00efve intuition\u201d. But this still leaves\n\u201cthe four dimensional universe of relativity independent of the\nself\u201d. Any attempt to \u201creintegrate\u201d four-dimensional\nspacetime into the self would have to proceed at a \u201csecond\nstage\u201d where, additionally, there would be no \u201csolid\nfoundation\u201d such as spatial and temporal intuition furnished\nKant at the first stage. Perhaps, Meyerson allowed, there is indeed\n\u201canother intuition, purely mathematical in nature\u201d, lying\nbehind spatial and temporal intuition, and capable of \u201cimagining\nthe four-dimensional universe, to which, in turn, it makes reality\nconform\u201d. This would make intuition a \u201ctwo-stage\nmechanism\u201d. While all of this is not\n\u201cinconceivable\u201d, it does appear, nonetheless,\n\u201crather complex and difficult if one reflects upon it\u201d. In\nany case, this is likely to be unnecessary, for considering the matter\n\u201cwith an open mind\u201d,\n\n\none would seem to be led to the position of those who believe that\nrelativity theory tends to destroy the concept of Kantian intuition.\n(1925: \u00a7\u00a7 151\u20132)\n\n\nMeyerson had come right up to the threshold of grasping the\nWeyl-Eddington geometric unification schemes in something like the\nsense in which they were intended. The stumbling block for him, and\nfor others, is the conviction that transcendental idealism can be\nsupported only from an argument about the nature of intuition, and\nintuitive representation. To be sure, the geometric framework for\nWeyl\u2019s construction of the objective four-dimensional world of\nrelativity is based upon the Evidenz available in\n\u201cessential insight\u201d, which is limited to the simple linear\nrelations and mappings in what is basically the tangent vector space\n\\(T_P\\) at a point P in a manifold. Thus in Weyl\u2019s\ndifferential geometry there is a fundamental divide between integrable\nand non-integrable relations of comparison. The latter are primitive\nand epistemologically privileged, but nonetheless not justified until\nit is shown how the infinitesimal homogeneous spaces, corresponding to\nthe \u201cessence of space as a form of intuition\u201d, are\ncompatible with the large-scale inhomogeneous spaces (spacetimes) of\ngeneral relativity. And this required not a philosophical argument\nabout the nature of intuition, but one formulated in group-theoretic\nconceptual form (Weyl 1923a,b). Eddington, on the other hand,\nwithout the cultural context of Husserlian phenomenology or indeed of\nphilosophy generally, jettisoned the intuitional basis of\ntranscendental idealism altogether, as if unaware of its prominence.\nThus he sought a superior and completely general conceptual\nbasis for the objective four-dimensional world of relativity theory by\nconstituting that world within a geometry (its \u201cworld\nstructure\u201d (1923)) based upon a non-metrical affine (i.e.,\nlinear and symmetric) connection. He was then free to find his own way\nto the empirically confirmed integrable metric relations of\nEinstein\u2019s theory without being hampered by the conflict of a\n\u201cpure infinitesimal\u201d metric with the observed facts about\natomic spectra.\n5.7 \u201cStructural Realism\u201d?\n\nIt has been routinely assumed that all the attempts at a\ngeometrization of physics in the early unified field theory program\nshared something of Einstein\u2019s hubris concerning the ability of\nmathematics to grasp the fundamental structure of the external world.\nThe geometrical unified field theory program thus appears to be\ninseparably stitched to a form of scientific realism, termed\n\u201cstructural realism\u201d, with perhaps even an inspired turn\ntoward Platonism. According to one (now termed\n\u201cepistemic\u201d) form of \u201cstructural realism\u201d,\nwhatever the intrinsic character or nature of the physical world, only\nits structure can be known, a structure of causal or other modal\nrelations between events or other entities governed by the equations\nof the theory. The gist of this version of structural realism was\nfirst clearly articulated by Russell in his Tarner Lectures at Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge in 1926. As Russell admits, it was the general\ntheory of relativity, particularly in the formulation given within\nEddington\u2019s world geometry, that led him to structuralism\nregarding cognition of physical reality (Russell 1927: 395). Russell,\nhowever, rested the epistemic limitation to knowledge of the structure\nof the physical world on the causal theory of perception. As such,\nstructural features of relations between events not present in the\npercepts of these events could only be inferred according to general\nlaws; hence, posits of unobserved structural features of the world are\nconstrained by exigencies of inductive inference. Moreover,\nRussell\u2019s structural realism quickly fell victim to a rather\nobvious objection lodged by the mathematical Max Newman (see entry on\n structural realism).\n\nIn its contemporary form, structural realism has both an epistemic and\nan \u201contic\u201d form, the latter holding essentially that\ncurrent physical theories warrant that the structural features of the\nphysical world alone are ontologically fundamental (Ladyman & Ross\n2007). Both versions of structural realism subscribe to a view of\ntheory change whereby the sole ontological continuity across changes\nin fundamental physical theory is continuity of structure, as in\ninstances where the equations of an earlier theory can be derived, say\nas limiting cases, from those of the later. Geometrical unification\ntheories seems tailored for this kind of realism. For if a geometrical\ntheory is taken to give a true or approximately true representation of\nthe physical world, it provides definite structure to relations\nposited as fundamental and presumably preserved in any subsequent\ngeometrical generalization. It is therefore instructive to recall that\nfor both Weyl and Eddington geometrical unification was not, nor could\nbe, such a representation, for essentially the reasons articulated two\ndecades before by Poincar\u00e9:\n\n\nDoes the harmony the human intelligence thinks it discovers in nature\nexist outside of this intelligence? No, beyond doubt, a reality\ncompletely independent of the mind which conceives it, sees or feels\nit, is an impossibility. A world as exterior as that, even if it\nexisted, would for us be forever inaccessible. But what we call\nobjective reality is, in the last analysis, what is common to many\nthinking beings, and could be common to all; this common\npart,\u2026, can only be the harmony expressed by mathematical laws.\nIt is this harmony then which is the sole objective reality\u2026.\n(1906: 14)\n\n\nIn Weyl and Eddington, geometrical unification was an attempt to cast\nthe harmony of the Einstein theory of gravitation in a new\nepistemological and so, explanatory, light, by displaying the field\nlaws of gravitation and electromagnetism within the common frame of a\ngeometrically represented observer-independent reality. Their\nunorthodox manner of philosophical argument, cloaked, perhaps\nnecessarily, in the language of differential geometry, has tended to\nconceal or obscure conclusions about the significance of a geometrized\nphysics that push in considerably different directions from either\ninstrumentalism or scientific realism.\n",
