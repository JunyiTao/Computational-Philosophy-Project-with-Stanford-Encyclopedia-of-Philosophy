Dionysius presents us with complex\naffirmative (kataphatic) and negative (apophatic)\nforms of theology, exploring what we can say about God, what we mean\nby our statements, discovering the necessity for us to talk too much\nabout God and to push language forms to their breaking points, and\nthen to see what we cannot say about God. Negation is important here\nat both levels, in kataphatic theology as well as in\napophatic theology. This complex theory of signification and\nits subversion is often referred to as negative theology: affirming\nour affirmations, then negating them, and then negating the negations\nto ensure that we do not make an idol out of a God about whom we know\nnothing. But it is also much more than this.\n\nDionysius is practising forms of theological meditation in\nthe sense that the earlier Church Fathers had understood this, not as\na type of objectified, academic knowledge, but rather as a more\ncomplex, intersubjective form of address, communion and contemplation.\nDionysius adopts the word theurgy, \u201cgod-work\u201d, together\nwith theology, \u201cgod-word\u201d, to describe the inmost reality\nof this practice, adopting it from the later Neoplatonist\nunderstanding of a hidden sympathy or interconnectedness between\nmaterial things and the sacred, divine significances resident in them\nby virtue of divine power. Iamblichus, for instance, had denied that\npure thought or contemplation could bring about union with the divine.\nWhat was crucial was the performance of certain ritual actions or\ntheurgy, \u201cgod-work\u201d, in the belief that one could attain\nto the divine by the incarnation of divine forces in material objects,\nstatues, or human beings through the divine power mirrored everywhere\nin the universe and in the natural sympathy of all parts, and not just\nby talking about the gods (theo-logy) or by looking at them\n(theoria). For some modern critics, Dionysius\u2019\nadaptation of pagan theurgy is analogous to calling the Christian\nsacraments \u201cmagical\u201d, which also results in the\nsubsumption of everything (morality as well as contemplation) to a\nform of magical correspondence. But Dionysius does not understand\ntheurgy in this way. For him, \u201ctheurgy is the consummation\n(sygkephalaiosis) of theology\u201d (EH 432B),\nwhich is to say that God\u2019s activity within all the orders of\nnature does not abolish nature, morality, contemplation, or science\nbut rather completes them and makes possible the divinization of human\nnature.\n\nGod\u2019s work in all things, therefore, turns the world into a\nreservoir of possibilities: at its lowest and most fragmented, it is\napparently a world of only individual, discrete things without\nsignificance, but in reality it is a world vested with signs, symbols,\nand hidden meanings as the multidimensional creation of a Triadic God.\nEven the lowest things cannot simply be despised, for even in their\ndissimilarity from the divine, they bear the capacity to signify the\ndivine more appropriately than supposedly worthier images. If we say\nGod is good, we run the risk of thinking we know entirely what we mean\nand consequently of closing off a thought that has to be radically\nopen-ended, if not altogether subverted. If we liken God to a\n\u201cworm\u201d, we subvert our own comfortable tendencies by being\nshocked into filling the image with enquiry. So the Psalmist who uses\nthe worm image hides the sacred from those who would defile\nit with a lack of understanding and yet points to the sacred\nin a new way. This constant tension or dialectic between hiddenness\nand openness pervades the whole of Dionysius\u2019 meditative\npractice of theology; and from this perspective Dionysius\u2019\npractice of writing is a complex and necessarily deceptive or\nsubversive process of reading the encoded insight (or contemplation)\nin created things in such a way that neither the perceptual beauty of\nthe material thing nor the deeper hidden beauty of the sign becomes a\ntrap, an idol, or a vanishing point but, instead, an activity that\nopens up an irresistibly beautiful world in and to God.\n\nThere are several consequences of this. First, Dionysius\u2019\nwriting is a response, a preparing of the organs of reception for the\nlove of God in praise and worship. In theology, we are learning how to\npraise, to hymn\u2014not to catalogue\u2014God. Second,\nsuch writing is dialogic and intersubjective to its core in three\nways: a) As \u201cin between\u201d teacher and pupil, dialogical\nreceptivity and transmission, open-ended in both directions,\ncharacterize its essential form; b) Even in the\ncontent of Dionysius\u2019 various works, replete as they\nare with triads (which can so easily be relegated to a Neoplatonic\nobscure penchant for providing intermediate links), this open-ended\nin-betweenness, characteristic of conversation and cooperation, is\nfundamental to the ranks of the various hierarchies. In the\nEH, for instance, in the triad catechumen (the one undergoing\npurification), sponsor or confirmed Christian (the one being\nillumined), and hierarch (the one being perfected and enlightening)\n(according to the traditional triadic form:\npurification\u2014illumination\u2014perfection), the sponsor first\nintroduces the catechumen and both sponsor and catechumen are then\nmediated by the work of the hierarch. For Dionysius at least (if not\nin the actual operation of a \u201cchurch\u201d), hierarchy is here\nnot a question of domination, but rather of a genuine open-endedness,\ntestability through interlocutor and mediator, community and\nresponsibility. c) Finally, what completes both the form and the\ncontent above all is prayer, since, for Dionysius (as for\nAnselm much later), prayer is the primary form of reverential\nphilosophical thought and receptivity, \u201cstretching ourselves\nout\u201d, as in Gregory of Nyssa, so as to be \u201clifted\nup\u201d (cf. DN 3). The most famous example of such prayer\nis the very beginning of the MT, where in the address/request\n\u201cTriad, above substance, above god, above good\u201d to\n\u201cmake our way straight to the topmost peak, beyond knowing and\nlight, of the mystical scriptures\u2014there where the simple,\nabsolute and unchangeable, mysteries of God\u2019s speaking lie\nwrapped in the darkness beyond light of secret\u2014hidden\nsilence\u201d, Timotheus, the disciple is also included, together\nwith us the readers.\n",
