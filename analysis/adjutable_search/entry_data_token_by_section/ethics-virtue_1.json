    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Virtue\n1.1 Virtue\n\nA virtue is an excellent trait of character. It is a disposition, well\nentrenched in its possessor\u2014something that, as we say, goes all\nthe way down, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker\u2014to\nnotice, expect, value, feel, desire, choose, act, and react in certain\ncharacteristic ways. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of\nperson with a certain complex mindset. A significant aspect of this\nmindset is the wholehearted acceptance of a distinctive range of\nconsiderations as reasons for action. An honest person cannot be\nidentified simply as one who, for example, practices honest dealing\nand does not cheat. If such actions are done merely because the agent\nthinks that honesty is the best policy, or because they fear being\ncaught out, rather than through recognising \u201cTo do otherwise\nwould be dishonest\u201d as the relevant reason, they are not the\nactions of an honest person. An honest person cannot be identified\nsimply as one who, for example, tells the truth because it is\nthe truth, for one can have the virtue of honesty without being\ntactless or indiscreet. The honest person recognises \u201cThat would\nbe a lie\u201d as a strong (though perhaps not overriding) reason for\nnot making certain statements in certain circumstances, and gives due,\nbut not overriding, weight to \u201cThat would be the truth\u201d as\na reason for making them.\n\nAn honest person\u2019s reasons and choices with respect to honest\nand dishonest actions reflect her views about honesty, truth, and\ndeception\u2014but of course such views manifest themselves with\nrespect to other actions, and to emotional reactions as well. Valuing\nhonesty as she does, she chooses, where possible to work with honest\npeople, to have honest friends, to bring up her children to be honest.\nShe disapproves of, dislikes, deplores dishonesty, is not amused by\ncertain tales of chicanery, despises or pities those who succeed\nthrough deception rather than thinking they have been clever, is\nunsurprised, or pleased (as appropriate) when honesty triumphs, is\nshocked or distressed when those near and dear to her do what is\ndishonest and so on. Given that a virtue is such a multi-track\ndisposition, it would obviously be reckless to attribute one to an\nagent on the basis of a single observed action or even a series of\nsimilar actions, especially if you don\u2019t know the agent\u2019s\nreasons for doing as she did (Sreenivasan 2002).\n\nPossessing a virtue is a matter of degree. To possess such a\ndisposition fully is to possess full or perfect virtue, which is rare,\nand there are a number of ways of falling short of this ideal\n(Athanassoulis 2000). Most people who can truly be described as fairly\nvirtuous, and certainly markedly better than those who can truly be\ndescribed as dishonest, self-centred and greedy, still have their\nblind spots\u2014little areas where they do not act for the reasons\none would expect. So someone honest or kind in most situations, and\nnotably so in demanding ones, may nevertheless be trivially tainted by\nsnobbery, inclined to be disingenuous about their forebears and less\nthan kind to strangers with the wrong accent.\n\nFurther, it is not easy to get one\u2019s emotions in harmony with\none\u2019s rational recognition of certain reasons for action. I may\nbe honest enough to recognise that I must own up to a mistake because\nit would be dishonest not to do so without my acceptance being so\nwholehearted that I can own up easily, with no inner conflict.\nFollowing (and adapting) Aristotle, virtue ethicists draw a\ndistinction between full or perfect virtue and\n\u201ccontinence\u201d, or strength of will. The fully virtuous do\nwhat they should without a struggle against contrary desires; the\ncontinent have to control a desire or temptation to do otherwise.\n\nDescribing the continent as \u201cfalling short\u201d of perfect\nvirtue appears to go against the intuition that there is something\nparticularly admirable about people who manage to act well when it is\nespecially hard for them to do so, but the plausibility of this\ndepends on exactly what \u201cmakes it hard\u201d (Foot 1978:\n11\u201314). If it is the circumstances in which the agent\nacts\u2014say that she is very poor when she sees someone drop a full\npurse or that she is in deep grief when someone visits seeking\nhelp\u2014then indeed it is particularly admirable of her to restore\nthe purse or give the help when it is hard for her to do so. But if\nwhat makes it hard is an imperfection in her character\u2014the\ntemptation to keep what is not hers, or a callous indifference to the\nsuffering of others\u2014then it is not.\n",
