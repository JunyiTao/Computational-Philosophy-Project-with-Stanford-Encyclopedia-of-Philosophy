    "main_text": "Bloch\u2019s Ontology of the Unfinished || The Core Ideas of Utopian Philosophy\n2.1 The Core Ideas of Utopian Philosophy\n\nBloch\u2019s philosophy is guided by the interest in the\nontologically grounded incompleteness of the world and the associated\ndrive towards the future. Genuine future, for Bloch, is radically\nuncertain: it is something that has never been before (GA 13: 228;\nBloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 1375f.]). One could think about this\nperspective as an attempt to formulate the specific relation of being\nand time, in which the future becomes constitutive modus of being (and\nof the present). The main philosophical question to be answered would\nthen be: how can the future, or utopia, be present\u2014as objective\npossibility\u2014and recognized\u2014as anticipation (Holz 1975)?\nPhilosophy\u2019s major task, for Bloch, becomes the exploration of\nthe possibilities inherent in our world, and the ontological formula\nproper to it is \u201cS is not yet P,\u201d meaning\nthat reality (or matter) is in the process of predication, and the\nworld itself is on the move searching for its essence. This short\nformula captures both the transitory, processual character of being,\nand the negativity associated with this\n process.[1]\n\nAs an open-ended process, a Not-Yet in the presence, reality must be\ngrasped both as unfinished and in its entirety. Even when a\nwish is fulfilled, when the dream comes true, there is an irreducible\nremainder to it that does not let one completely satisfied. The major\nproblem for Bloch\u2019s philosophy is thus to find the ways the\nfuture, that becomes the key dimension of\n time,[2]\n could still be discovered, recognized, and explored as part of the\npresent. This dynamic moment is also referred to as an \u201cutopian\nfunction\u201d. The notion of utopia is so central in Bloch precisely\nbecause it captures this anticipatory drive of realizing something\nqualitatively new (novum), but doing it not in an\n\u201cabstract\u201d way, as merely an invocation of a general\nnormative ideal, but rather in a form of immanent critique and thus of\na dialectical mediation, something Bloch calls \u201cconcrete\nutopia\u201d. The object of anticipation, or what Bloch later\ndescribed as \u201cUltimum\u201d, is a reality of non-alienated,\nnon-exploitative relations of humans among each other and with the\nnature. Bloch\u2019s philosophy is loaded with this normative meaning\nof the directedness towards the unity of the ideal and the real.\n\nBloch thus conceives of the world as a utopian whole. In this\nontological conception, logic also plays its role\u2014not as the\nbeginning of knowledge, for Bloch insists on wonder and amazement as\nits beginning (see below),\u2014but in its heuristic function\nformalizing and structuring the categories needed to grasp a complex\nchanging reality (Bloch 2000a). Bloch\u2019s \u201cspeculative\nmaterialism\u201d understands matter as \u201creal\npossibility\u201d (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 235f.]), natura\nnaturans, which does not require an external formal\ndetermination, but rather bears its future within itself. Matter is\nthus historicized. \u201cSpeculative\u201d implies that matter, the\nsource of radical novelty, is the concept that relates to the totality\nof the world, and not just to its single aspect (Moir 2019b). It is\nthis ontological reference that defines Bloch\u2019s key insight:\nutopia is not a \u201cmere\u201d phantasy, since it is the whole\nworld, which is dreaming, or \u201cventuring beyond\u201d.\n\nHowever, early Bloch tries to grasp this dimension of the future\nmostly by referring to the subjectivity (\u201csoul\u201d, as he\ncalls it in The Spirit of Utopia or \u201crevolutionary\nmagic of the subject\u201d, as in Thomas M\u00fcntzer) and\ncommunity of those who should fulfill the utopian promise the world\ngives to itself. In his first books Bloch speaks a spiritualist,\nprophetic, performative language and draws heavily on the wealth of\nmystical\u2014in particular, gnostic\u2014traditions, in a\nparadoxical attempt to synthesize them with Marxist materialism\n(Christen 1979). This focus on subjective anticipation led Adorno to\nremark that Bloch\u2019s key argument is akin to an ontological\nproof: the very presence and persistence of utopian anticipation, the\nvery desire to transcend the status quo supports the idea\nthat the world is pregnant with unrealized possibilities (Bloch 1988:\n16).\n\nThe important starting point for Bloch\u2019s philosophy is, in\nvarious forms, the subjective experience of non-identity and fragility\nthat goes under the names of \u201cdarkness of the lived\nmoment\u201d or \u201cthe shape of inconstruable question\u201d\n(denoting the impossibility of formulating the ultimate metaphysical\nproblem without relying on a pre-given solution) (Czajka 2006). Bloch\nemphasizes the non-availability of the very core of our existence and\nthe associated feeling of lack. Human consciousness can never fully\nexperience itself and cannot immediately grasp the full meaning of its\nmomentary state (1969 [GA 10: 74, 145f.]). The darkness of the future\nserves as the objective counterpart of this experience.\n\nDealing with the phenomena of temporality\u2014along with the\nepisodes of amazement (Staunen) or estrangement\n(Verfremdung)\u2014should demonstrate how the perceived\nreality, as well as the traditional epistemology that assumes it fixed\nand given, can be destabilized and open to intentional anticipatory\npraxis. Bloch considers temporality in its qualitative, intensive\ndimension, it is attached to\u2014and is, in its very definition,\ndependent on\u2014what is happening existentially and historically\n(GA 13: 129, 138; see also Holz 1975; Hartmann 2012). For Bloch,\nunlike in the philosophies of dur\u00e9e, the discontinuity\nof time and its social conditionality are decisive (Levinas 1976).\nWhile estrangement demonstrates the falsity of the given context, the\namazement, that is as ineffable and as transient as the darkness of\nthe lived moment (Bloch 1918 [2000: 199f.]), reveals the final\nidentity of subject and object.\n\nLater, Bloch formulated the notion of \u201cfront\u201d as the most\nactual moment of the process that often requires our ability to grasp\nnew opportunities (Siebers 2012). For Bloch\u2019s idea of\ntemporality, the concept of fulfilled moment is also important, for\nthis is the moment that is being anticipated in many utopian\nprojections. The intensity of Bloch\u2019s early thinking rests on\nthe unresolved contradiction between the insistence on full immediate\npresence of the utopian (primarily of ethical nature, such as the\nself-evidence of the good), and the impossibility to fully grasp,\narticulate, and appropriate it.\n\nIn the later work, Bloch is more systematic in putting together his\nphilosophical intuitions, and less radical in staging the epiphanies\nof the world\u2019s utopian goal. For example, he tries to codify\ndifferent levels of a \u201cpossibility\u201d (Bloch 1954\u201359\n[1986a: Ch. 18]). But even later, in the T\u00fcbingen\nIntroduction to Philosophy, the starting point of his reflection\nis an existential human drive (hunger). Bloch then describes this\nprocess of realization in a more abstract form as a way from the That\n(Da\u00df), an active potency, to its product, the What\n(Was). The structures of objective world come to themselves\nvia the \u201csubjective factor\u201d. It is this critical\nsubjectivity that helps escape the reification of various structures\nof reality and allows to study it in its processual complexity (Bloch\n2000a), and it is this subjective intervention that is called for in\nthe open-ended process, because its outcome is uncertain and dependent\non this human praxis (Gekle 1986). Bloch envisions a mutual\ndialectical mediation of the subjective and the objective\n(\u201cnaturalization of human and humanization of nature\u201d, see\nRaulet 1982) and maintains that the matter moves on a higher level\nwhen comprehended and mediated by human practical consciousness that\nemerges within it, the laboring individual as its potentiality (Bloch\n1954\u201359 [1986a: 261]). As Bloch puts it, the human is the answer\nto the world-as-question, whereby this question itself is understood\nin all its existential intensity. This emergence of consciousness and\nfreedom (Moir 2019b) itself reflects the inherent disposition within\nmatter as an open process, its autonomous activity, something Bloch\ngladly inherits from the \u201capocryphal\u201d traditions of\nmaterialism\u2014\u201cleft\u201d Aristotelianism (Bloch 1952\n[2018]) and Renaissance thinkers, notably Giordano Bruno, but also\nSchelling (Habermas 1969/1970). As Bloch reads this tradition, the\ncreation of the world is not a wholly external act, but a\n\u201cself-movement, self-fertilization of the matter of God\u201d\n(Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 236]). The utopian process for Bloch is\nalso a realization of the \u201crealizing element\u201d (cf. Bloch\n1954\u201359 [1986a: ch. 20]; GA 15, ch. 49), a fulfillment of an\nactive subjectivity. In Bloch\u2019s ontology\u2014that can always\nbe also read as an anthropology (Siebers 2013)\u2014the redemption of\nnature and of the human being are thus presupposing each other.\n\nFollowing various strands of philosophy, Bloch thus develops a\nqualitative vision of nature, he conceives nature as a creative drive\ntowards the realization of the possible (or latency), a drive that can\nbe understood with the concept of nature-subject\n(Natursubjekt), something that could be reproached as\nanthropomorphism (Habermas 1969/1970). A nature-subject itself remains\nan internal impulse, an \u201cimmanent agency\u201d (Moir 2013:\n128f.) within the material world (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 673]).\nTo put it in aesthetic terminology, Bloch reminds us that the\nlandscape\u2014a human creation\u2014is a potentiality of nature.\nThe chance for a better outcome in the history of nature is not only\ndependent on the human activity but is\u2014qua this\nactivity\u2014the potentiality of nature itself.\n\nThe concept of hope captures the universal anticipatory drive\nin human and non-human world\u2014as permeated by futurity. For\nBloch, hope is self-consciousness of human praxis (Holz 1975)\nthat needs an ontological foundation. Many hopes can turn out to be\nillusions, but even illusory hopes can give indications to some very\nreal human wishes and drives. Hope aims at something uncertain and\noften beyond the control of the actor (Tegtmeyer 2012), and thus can\nalways be disappointed. It is this uncertainty that made Riedel (1994)\ninterpret Bloch\u2019s early philosophy as a form of a postmodern\n\u201cweak thought\u201d in the spirit of Vattimo (1985 [1988]), a\nthought that refuses to seek prior transcendent foundations for\nitself.\n\nThe inherent\nopenness of the object of hope is\u2014unlike the existential fear, which,\nBloch remarks, can also anticipate,\u2014enabling, rather than\nlimiting the human capacities, because this is the uncertainty of\npotentialities, that, despite being often disappointed, never cease to\nexist (Vidal 2012). Bloch distinguishes hope from quietism and thinks\nof it as a practical, transformative attitude to the world. As such,\nit cannot be blind and \u201cabstract\u201d, but should be grounded\nin objective real tendencies, something that also precludes Bloch from\nembracing an absolute contingency of the future.\n\nAn important anthropological dimension of Bloch\u2019s ontology is\nthe idea of the \u201cNot-Yet-Conscious\u201d, which Bloch would\nthen oppose to the Freudian emphasis on the unconscious as something\n\u201cno longer conscious\u201d, or repressed. In this critique,\nBloch assumes that the unconscious is merely quantitatively different\nfrom the conscious, complementing it\u2014and not a completely,\nqualitatively different domain that limits the conscious, as Freud\nbelieved (Gekle 1986). Unlike Freud, Bloch is more interested in the\nways human desires and drives contribute to the political emancipatory\npraxis. He accuses Freud of a tautological closedness associated with\nhis understanding of the unconscious: for Bloch, Freud\u2019s\npsychoanalysis aims at merely reconstructing what has already been, or\nrecollecting, instead of venturing towards the radical and unsettling\nnovelty of the Not-Yet. Similar critique is voiced against Plato or\nBergson (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a]), but most significantly, in\nSubjekt-Objekt, against Hegel\u2019s dialectics as\n\u201canamnesis\u201d (1951 [GA 8]). The general pattern of this\ncritique is the distrust toward the arguments that explain phenomena\nby grounding them in a deeper essential principle, whereby the\nprinciple itself, as eternal truth, remains posited and unchanged.\nEven in Hegel Bloch finds a fetishization of the logical idea and the\ntendency to closure, reducing the ontological process to the static\nconstruction of the idealistic absolute.\n",
