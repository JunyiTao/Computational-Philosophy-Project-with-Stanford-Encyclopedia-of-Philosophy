    "main_text": "Defining the fa Tradition || Major fa Texts\n1.1 Major fa Texts\n\nOf the ten fajia texts in the Han imperial catalogue, six\nceased circulating more than a millennium ago; two arrived at our days\nrelatively intact, and of two others only a few fragments survived the\nvicissitudes of time. The earliest (in terms of its composition)\nsurviving text is the Book of Lord Shang\n(Shangjunshu \u5546\u541b\u66f8), attributed to Shang\nYang (aka Gongsun Yang \u516c\u5b6b\u9785 or Lord Shang/Lord of\nShang \u5546\u541b), a major reformer who orchestrated the rise of\nthe state of Qin \u79e6 to the position of a leading power in the\nChinese world. In the process of transmission, the book lost at least\nfive chapters; a few others had been badly damaged, becoming barely\nlegible. Since the late 18th century, efforts have been made to\nprepare a critical edition of the text and amend its corrupted parts;\nyet more than two centuries passed before the comprehensive critical\nedition was published (Zhang Jue 2012). The text is highly\nheterogeneous in terms of the dates of its composition: some chapters\nwere likely penned by Shang Yang himself; others may come from the\nhand of his immediate disciples and followers, and a few other were\nwritten decades and even more than a century after his death (Pines\n2016a). This said, the text presents a relatively coherent ideological\nvision, and it is likely that it reflects intellectual evolution of\nwhat Zheng Liangshu (1989) dubbed Shang Yang\u2019s\n\u201cschool\u201d (xuepai \u5b78\u6d3e). The text\nmerited two translations into English: Duyvendak ([1928] 1963) and\nPines (2017).\n\nThe second surviving text, Han Feizi, is attributed to Han\nFei, a scion of the ruling family from the state of H\u00e1n\n\u97d3 (not to be confused with the H\u00e0n \u6f22 dynasty), a\ntragic figure who was allegedly killed in the custody of the King of\nQin, whom Han Fei wanted to serve. Of all the fa texts in the\nHan imperial catalogue, Han Feizi fared the best over the\nvicissitudes of time: all of its 55 chapters attested in the Han\ncatalog are still intact. The issue of whether or not the entire book\nhad been penned by Han Fei is debatable: considerable differences\namong the chapters in terms of style and mode of argumentation lead\nnot a few scholars to suspect that they come from different authors\n(e.g., Queen 2013). On the other hand, the differences may be\nexplained as reflecting the process of Han Fei\u2019s intellectual\nmaturation, or the need to adapt argumentation to different audiences;\noverall, most of the chapters present a fairly coherent outlook (cf.\nGoldin 2020: 222\u201328 and Pines, forthcoming B). Han\nFeizi is considered as philosophically and literally more\nengaging than the Book of Lord Shang, and it has been more\nwidely studied in China, Japan (Sato 2013b), and in the West. It\nmerited one full English translation (Liao 1939\u20131959), with a\nnew one (Harbsmeier, which is borrowed, with modifications, below)\nforthcoming. In addition, many chapters have been translated by Burton\nWatson (2003).\n\nTwo other fa texts mentioned in the Han imperial catalog did\nnot survive intact, but lengthy quotations from them in the imperial\nencyclopedia have allowed partial reconstruction of their content.\nSh\u0113nzi \u7533\u5b50 is attributed to Shen Buhai, who\nacted as a chancellor of the state of H\u00e1n \u97d3 in the\nmiddle fourth century BCE, and who is credited with major\nadministrative improvement there. Of the original six chapters fewer\nthan three dozen fragments remain intact; for a comprehensive study\ncum translation see Creel 1974. Another text, Sh\u00e8nzi\n\u614e\u5b50 is attributed to Shen Dao \u614e\u5230, of whom\nvery little is known (it is even possible that the figure of Shen Dao\nis a conflation of several personalities; see Xu Fuhong 2013:\n2\u20138). Of original 42 chapters, seven survived (albeit in an\nincomplete form) in a seventh-century CE encyclopedia; altogether over\n120 surviving fragments of the text are considered authentic (Thompson\n1979; cf. Xu Fuhong 2013). The text merited a full English translation\ncum study (Harris 2016). In what follows, to avoid confusion between\nSh\u0113nzi and Sh\u00e8nzi, they will be referred\nto as works of Shen Buhai and Shen Dao respectively.\n\nThe above four texts are the major repository of the fa\nthought. Whereas they differ in terms of philosophical sophistication,\nmodes of argumentation, lexicon, and emphases, overall they present a\nsufficiently coherent outlook to merit their grouping together as\nbelonging to a single intellectual tradition. Another major text that\never since the Sui \u968b dynasty (581\u2013618) had been\nreclassified as belonging to fajia is Guanzi\n\u7ba1\u5b50. Guanzi is nominally attributed to a major\nreformer, Guan Zhong \u7ba1\u4ef2 (d. 645 BCE) from the state of\nQi \u9f4a, but in reality it is a heterogeneous collection of essays\nproduced between the fourth and second centuries BCE (Rickett 1985:\n8\u201324). Some (but not all) of the Guanzi chapters\nclearly belong to the fa tradition (Sato, forthcoming). The\nwhole of Guanzi was translated into English by Rickett\n(1985\u20131998).\n\nIn addition to the above, traces of fa thought are found in a\nfew chapters of other multi-authored compilation, such as\nL\u00fcshi chunqiu \u5442\u6c0f\u6625\u79cb (composed\nca. 240 BCE) and Huainanzi \u6dee\u5357\u5b50 (composed\nca. 139 BCE; see Ames 1994). The impact of the fa tradition\nis visible in memorials of early imperial statesmen, most notably of\nthe man who is considered the architect of the Qin Empire\n(221\u2013207 BCE), Li Si \u674e\u65af (d. 208 BCE) (see Bodde\n1938). Another statesman who is often identified as belonging to the\nfa tradition is an early Han minister, Chao Cuo\n\u9f02\u932f (d. 154 BCE; Schwermann, forthcoming). Yet a few\ngenerations into the Han dynasty, the fa tradition started\nlosing its prestige and vitality. Although several Han and later texts\nwere intermittently classified as fajia, this identification\nremains too arbitrary to merit the inclusion of these texts in the\ncurrent discussion.\n",
