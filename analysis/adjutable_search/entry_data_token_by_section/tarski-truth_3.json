This means that the objects satisfying\n\\(\\phi\\) should be exactly the objects that we would intuitively count\nas being true sentences of \\(L\\), and that this fact should be\nprovable from the axioms of the metalanguage. At first sight this is a\nparadoxical requirement: if we can prove what Tarski asks for, just\nfrom the axioms of the metalanguage, then we must already have a\nmaterially adequate formalisation of \u2018true sentence of\n\\(L\\)\u2019 within the metalanguage, suggesting an infinite regress.\nIn fact Tarski escapes the paradox by using (in general) infinitely\nmany sentences of \\(M\\) to express truth, namely all the sentences of\nthe form \n\\[\n\\phi(s) \\text{ if and only if } \\psi\n\\]\n\n\nwhenever \\(s\\) is the name of a sentence \\(S\\) of \\(L\\) and \\(\\psi\\)\nis the copy of \\(S\\) in the metalanguage. So the technical problem is\nto find a single formula \\(\\phi\\) that allows us to deduce all these\nsentences from the axioms of \\(M\\); this formula \\(\\phi\\) will serve\nto give the explicit definition of True.\n\nTarski\u2019s own name for this criterion of material adequacy was\nConvention T. More generally his name for his approach to\ndefining truth, using this criterion, was the semantic conception\nof truth.\n\nAs Tarski himself emphasised, Convention \\(T\\) rapidly leads to the\nliar paradox if the language \\(L\\) has enough resources to talk about\nits own semantics. (See the entry on\n the revision theory of truth.)\n Tarski\u2019s own conclusion was that a truth definition for a\nlanguage \\(L\\) has to be given in a metalanguage which is essentially\nstronger than \\(L\\).\n\nThere is a consequence for the foundations of mathematics. First-order\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory is widely regarded as the standard of\nmathematical correctness, in the sense that a proof is correct if and\nonly if it can be formalised as a formal proof in set theory. We would\nlike to be able to give a truth definition for set theory; but by\nTarski\u2019s result this truth definition can\u2019t be given in\nset theory itself. The usual solution is to give the truth definition\ninformally in English. But there are a number of ways of giving\nlimited formal truth definitions for set theory. For example Azriel\nLevy showed that for every natural number \\(n\\) there is a\n\\(\\Sigma_n\\) formula that is satisfied by all and only the\nset-theoretic names of true \\(\\Sigma_n\\) sentences of set theory. The\ndefinition of \\(\\Sigma_n\\) is too technical to give here, but three\npoints are worth making. First, every sentence of set theory is\nprovably equivalent to a \\(\\Sigma_n\\) sentence for any large enough\n\\(n\\). Second, the class of \\(\\Sigma_n\\) formulas is closed under\nadding existential quantifiers at the beginning, but not under adding\nuniversal quantifiers. Third, the class is not closed under negation;\nthis is how Levy escapes Tarski\u2019s paradox. (See the entry on\n set theory.)\n Essentially the same devices allow Jaakko Hintikka to give an\ninternal truth definition for his\n independence friendly logic;\n this logic shares the second and third properties of Levy\u2019s\nclasses of formulas.\n",
