    "main_text": "\n\nAn inductive logic is a logic of evidential support. In a deductive\nlogic, the premises of a valid deductive argument logically\nentail the conclusion, where logical entailment means\nthat every logically possible state of affairs that makes the premises\ntrue must make the conclusion true as well. Thus, the\npremises of a valid deductive argument provide total support\nfor the conclusion. An inductive logic extends this idea to weaker\narguments. In a good inductive argument, the truth of the premises\nprovides some degree of support for the truth of the\nconclusion, where this degree-of-support might be measured\nvia some numerical scale. By analogy with the notion of deductive\nentailment, the notion of inductive degree-of-support might mean\nsomething like this: among the logically possible states of affairs\nthat make the premises true, the conclusion must be true in (at least)\nproportion r of them\u2014where r is some numerical\nmeasure of the support strength.\n\nIf a logic of good inductive arguments is to be of any\nreal value, the measure of support it articulates should be up to the task. Presumably, the logic should at least satisfy the following condition: \n\n\nCriterion of Adequacy (CoA):\n\nThe logic should make it likely (as a matter of logic) that as evidence accumulates,\nthe total body of true evidence claims will eventually come to indicate, via the logic\u2019s measure of\nsupport, that false hypotheses are probably false and that true\nhypotheses are probably true.\n\n\nThe CoA stated here may strike some readers as surprisingly strong. Given a specific logic of evidential support, how might it be shown to satisfy such a condition?\nSection 4 will show precisely how this condition is satisfied by the logic of evidential support articulated in Sections 1 through 3 of this article.\n\nThis article will focus on the kind of the approach to inductive logic\nmost widely studied by epistemologists and logicians in recent years.\nThis approach employs conditional probability functions to represent\nmeasures of the degree to which evidence statements support\nhypotheses. Presumably, hypotheses should be empirically evaluated\nbased on what they say (or imply) about the likelihood that evidence claims will be true. A\nstraightforward theorem of probability theory, called Bayes\u2019\nTheorem, articulates the way in which what hypotheses say about the likelihoods of evidence claims influences the degree to which hypotheses are\nsupported by those evidence claims. Thus, this approach to the logic\nof evidential support is often called a Bayesian Inductive\nLogic or a Bayesian Confirmation Theory. This article will first provide a detailed explication of a Bayesian approach to inductive logic. It will\nthen examine the extent to which this logic may pass muster as\nan adequate logic of evidential support for hypotheses. In particular,\nwe will see how such a logic may be shown to satisfy the Criterion of\nAdequacy stated above.\n\nSections 1 through 3 present all of the main ideas underlying the\n(Bayesian) probabilistic logic of evidential support. These\nthree sections should suffice to provide an adequate understanding of\nthe subject. Section 5 extends this account to cases where the implications of\nhypotheses about evidence claims (called likelihoods)\nare vague or imprecise. After reading Sections 1 through 3, the reader may safely skip directly to Section 5, bypassing the rather technical account in Section 4 of how how the CoA is satisfied.\n\nSection 4\n is for the more advanced reader who wants an understanding of how\nthis logic may bring about convergence to the true hypothesis\nas evidence accumulates. This result shows that the Criterion of\nAdequacy is indeed satisfied\u2014that as evidence accumulates, false\nhypotheses will very probably come to have evidential support values\n(as measured by their posterior probabilities) that approach\n0; and as this happens, a true hypothesis may very probably acquire\nevidential support values (as measured by its posterior\nprobability) that approaches 1.\n",
