    "main_text": "Principal Varieties in More Detail || Prescriptivism and Universal Prescriptivism\n2.2 Prescriptivism and Universal Prescriptivism\n\nPrescriptivists suggest that moral judgments are a species of\nprescriptive judgement and that moral sentences in the indicative mood\nare semantically more akin to imperatives than indicatives. One way to\nthink of the idea is that moral terms function as force indicators on\nanalogy with mood. Early prescriptivists thought that this had radical\nimplications for moral reasoning and argument. Carnap suggested that\nmoral judgments are equivalent to relatively simple imperatives. The\nstatement \u2018Killing is evil\u2019 means the same thing as\n\u2018Do not kill.\u2019 On that basis he claimed that there could\nbe no moral knowledge or error (Carnap 1937; 23\u201324 &\n29).\n\nBy contrast current versions of prescriptivism, most developed in the\nworks of R. M. Hare, have attempted to vindicate moral thinking as a\nrational enterprise. The main idea here is that while moral sentences\ndo in fact express a species of prescription much as ordinary\nimperatives do, they express prescriptions of a special universal\nsort. And it is largely because they are prescriptions of this sort\nthat they are subject to various consistency constraints, so that\naccepting one moral judgment carries with it a requirement that one\naccept other judgments in some respects like it. While Hare denies\nthat moral judgments are exactly equivalent to prescriptions\nexpressible in any other form of words, he does tell us a lot about\nwhat they mean. Moral imperatives are universal in a number of ways.\nThey are to apply not just to the agent about whom they are made (if\nthey are made with respect to a particular agent) but also to any\nagent who is similarly situated. And they apply to any action or\nobject which is relevantly similar to the actions or objects about\nwhich the judgment is made. They apply to all relevantly similar cases\nat any time and any place. Thus, very roughly, when one calls an\naction right one is not only prescribing the action in question, but\nalso any relevantly similar action wherever and whenever it occurs.\nAnd the prescription is addressed not only to the agent whose action\nis up for assessment but also to every other person, including the\nspeaker and listeners. In this way, Hare believes, calling an action\nwrong commits the speaker to judging wrong any relevantly similar\naction done at any time and any place by any person.\n\nWith ordinary prescriptions, it isn\u2019t obvious that there is a\nstate of mind that someone must be in if they utter or obey a command\nand which we ought to characterize as accepting an imperative. Hare,\nhimself at one point argues that there is no substantive way of\ncharacterizing the attitude a person must have if she expresses or\naccepts a prescription or moral judgment (Hare 1952, 9\u201311). Even\nso, prescriptivists have some reason for wanting to offer an account\nof accepting a moral judgment if they want to explain moral practice.\nOrdinarily we attribute moral judgments to people, even people who are\nsilent. So the prescriptivist will want to say something about our\nbasis for these attributions. An account of the attitude that\nconstitutes accepting a moral judgment will allow them to ground such\nattributions. One suggestion is that the attitude of accepting a moral\njudgment involves an intention to do what the judgments recommend.\nSincerely accepting a command directed at oneself involves doing it if\none is in circumstances where it applies and one is able and otherwise\nintending to do it should one find oneself in those circumstances\n(Hare 1952, 20). Since moral commands are universal according to the\ntheory, they will be directed at everyone. Thus anyone who sincerely\naccepts a moral judgment will be disposed to do what they believe\nright in circumstances where they can. Less sincere judgments may lack\nthis connection (Hare 1952, 169). The issue of which attitude, if any,\nare involved in accepting a prescription is relevant to some of the\narguments over internalism that we will consider below.\n",
