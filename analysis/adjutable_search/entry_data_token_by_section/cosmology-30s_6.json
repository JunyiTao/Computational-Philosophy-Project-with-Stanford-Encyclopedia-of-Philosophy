    "main_text": "Cosmology and its philosophy || Milne\u2019s Philosophical Challenge\n3.2 Milne\u2019s Philosophical Challenge\n\nMilne\u2019s metaphysical views were based in positivism, most\nespecially in operationalism: only those objects whose\nproperties could be directly revealed by some observational procedure,\nor operation, were to be counted among the real. Thus, for Milne,\nreality did not contain the usual relativistic cosmology referents\n\u201ccurved space\u201d, \u201cexpanding space\u201d or even\n\u201cfour-dimensional spacetime\u201d, simply because none of these\nentities were operationalizable. Milne held that \u2018what you see\nis what you get\u2019; since \u201ccurved space\u201d of various\ngeometries couldn\u2019t be observed, space was just as it\nlooked\u2014Euclidean. In the same way, the expanding of the Universe\nwas a genuine expanding\u2014each galaxy was retreating from each\nother\u2014not just a change in the geometry of the curvature, as it\nwas for the relativists. Moreover, in place of relativistic\ncosmology\u2019s inductive empiricism, Milne opted for a\nhypothetico-deductive rationalism. Cosmologists, Milne\nbelieved, were bound to dream up any and all possible models of a\nuniverse, and then deduce what, if any, observable consequences\nfollowed from their hypotheses. Hypothesizing could be based upon just\nabout anything, although Milne believed that certain very general\nrational principles derived from aesthetic beliefs about universal\norder and regularity would be the most fruitful. His\n\u2018cosmological principle\u2019, namely, that every\ncosmologist in the universe should look out upon the same cosmos, was\nthe prime example of such thinking. Later, Bondi would found\nSteady-state Cosmology on an even more general version of\nMilne\u2019s principle, which he called the \u2018perfect\ncosmological principle.\u2019\n",
