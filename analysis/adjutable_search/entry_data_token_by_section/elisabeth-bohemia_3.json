    "main_text": "Correspondence with Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n4. Correspondence with Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n\nElisabeth\u2019s correspondence with Descartes begins at her initiative in\n1643 and continues until Descartes\u2019s death in early 1650. Elisabeth\ndoes not seem to have produced any systematic philosophical work, and\nher extant philosophical writings consist almost entirely of her\ncorrespondence with Descartes. While we have Descartes\u2019s works, and\ncenturies of interpretation to contextualize his side of the exchange,\nwe do not have this larger picture in which to situate Elisabeth\u2019s\nthoughts. Thus, any account of her proper philosophical position must\nbe gleaned through interpretation. It is evident from the\ncorrespondence that Elisabeth has a remarkable and wide-ranging\ncritical philosophical acumen. Careful reading of her side of the\ncorrespondence does suggest she has some positive philosophical\ncommitments of her own, on matters including the nature of causation,\nthe nature of the mind, explanations of natural phenomena, virtue, and\ngood governance.\n",
