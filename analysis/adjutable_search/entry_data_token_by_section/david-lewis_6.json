    "main_text": "Counterfactuals || Similarity\n3.3 Similarity\n\nIn Counterfactuals, Lewis does not say a lot about similarity\nof worlds. He has some short arguments that we can make sense of the\nnotion of two worlds being similar. And he notes that on different\noccasions we may wish to use different notions of similarity,\nsuggesting a kind of context dependency of counterfactuals. But the\nnotion is not spelled out in much more detail.\n\nSome reactions to the book showed that Lewis needed to say more here.\nKit Fine (1975) argued that given what Lewis had said to date, (3.5)\nwould be false, when it should be true.\n\n(3.5) If Richard Nixon had pushed the button, there would have been a\nnuclear war.\n\n\n(\u2018The button\u2019 in question is the button designed to launch\nnuclear missiles.) The reason it would be false is that a world in\nwhich the mechanisms of nuclear warfare spontaneously failed but then\nlife went on as usual, would be more similar, all things considered,\nto actuality than a world in which the future consisted entirely of a\npost-nuclear apocalypse.\n\nIn \u201cCounterfactual Dependence and Time\u2019s Arrow\u201d\n(1979c), Lewis responded by saying more about the notion of\nsimilarity. In particular, he offered an algorithm for determining\nsimilarity in standard contexts. He still held that the particular\nmeasure of similarity in use on an occasion is context-sensitive, so\nthere is no one true measure of similarity. Nevertheless there is, he\nthought, a default measure that we use unless there is a reason to\navoid it. Here is how Lewis expressed this default measure.\n\nIt is of the first importance to avoid big, widespread, diverse\nviolations of law.\nIt is of the second importance to maximize the spatio-temporal\nregion throughout which perfect match of particular fact\nprevails.\nIt is of the third importance to avoid even small, localized,\nsimple violations of law.\nIt is of little or no importance to secure approximate similarity\nof particular fact, even in matters that concern us greatly. (Lewis\n1979c: 47\u20138)\n\n\nLewis argues that by this measure, worlds in which the mechanisms of\nnuclear warfare spontaneously fail will be less similar to the actual\nworld than the post-nuclear apocalypse. That\u2019s because the\nfailure of those mechanisms will either lead to divergence from the\nactual world (if they fail partially) or widespread, diverse\nviolations of law (if they fail completely). In the former case,\nthere\u2019s a violation of law that isn\u2019t made up for in an\nincrease in how much spatio-temporal match we get. In the latter case\nthe gain we get in similarity is only an expansion of the\nspatio-temporal region throughout which perfect match of particular\nfact prevails, but that doesn\u2019t help in getting us closer to\nactuality if we\u2019ve added a big miracle. So in fact the nearest\nworlds are ones where a nuclear war occurs, and (3.5) is true.\n\nOne way to see the effects of Lewis\u2019s ordering is to work\nthrough its implication for an important class of cases. When the\nantecedent of a counterfactual is about the occurrence or\nnon-occurrence of a particular event E at time t,\nthe effect of these rules is to say that the nearest worlds are the\nworlds where the following claims all hold, with t* being as\nlate as possible.\n\nThere is an exact match of particular fact with actuality up to\nt*.\nThere is a small, localized law violation at t*.\nThere is exact conformity to the laws of actuality after\nt*.\nThe antecedent is true.\n\n\nSo we find a point just before t where we can make the\nantecedent true by making a small law violation, and let the laws take\nover from there. There is something intuitively plausible about this\nway of viewing counterfactuals; often we do aim to talk about what\nwould have happened if things had gone on in accordance with the laws,\ngiven a starting point slightly different from the one that actually\nobtained.\n\nJonathan Bennett (2003) notes that when the antecedent of a\nconditional is not about a particular event, Lewis\u2019s conditions\nprovide the wrong results. For instance, if the antecedent is of the\nform If one of these events had not happened, then\nLewis\u2019s rules say that the nearest world where the antecedent is\ntrue is always the world where the most recent such event did not\nhappen. But this does not seem to provide intuitively correct truth\nconditions for such conditionals. This need not bother Lewis\u2019s\nlarger project. For one thing, Lewis was not committed to there being\na uniform similarity metric for all counterfactuals. Lewis could say\nthat his default metric was only meant to apply to cases where the\nantecedent was about the happening or non-happening of a particular\nevent at a particular time, and it wouldn\u2019t have seriously\nundermined his larger project. Indeed, as we\u2019ll see in Section\n5.2 below, the counterfactuals he was most interested in, and for\nwhich these criteria of similarity were devised, did have antecedents\nconcerning specific events.\n",
