Scientific Status of Economics and its Methodology\n\nNewton lay down the gauntlet in his well-known Query 31 to\nthe Opticks (1704), namely that his methods for deciphering\nthe natural world might prove efficacious in understanding the moral\nsphere. Many took up his plea to advance the moral sciences. In\nFrance, one could name Voltaire, Condillac and Condorcet, and in\nBritain, Hutcheson, Hume, and Smith. The common conviction was to\nidentify sufficient uniformities to human nature that resulted in\nmanifest patterns, whether in the economic or political sphere.\nHume\u2019s associationist psychology and the copy principle implied\nremarkable uniformity in the machinery of the human mind, while Smith\ntreated the sympathetic regard as akin to gravitational attraction.\nBoth believed that introspection meant that the moral sciences,\nincluding economics could become epistemically superior to the natural\nsciences. As both Hume and Smith pointed out, pre-modern philosophers\nhad endorsed a geocentric universe for thousands of years and in\nmodern times, mistakenly adhered to the system of Cartesian vortices\nfor almost a century. Nothing compared to the occasionalism of\nMalebranche, that Hume deemed \u201ca fairy land\u201d (Hume 1748\n[2000: 57]). In the moral realm, however, we could know right away if\nsomething is as fanciful as a system of vortices. Both Hume and Smith\nwere fallibilists about all knowledge, but they each argued that we\nare more likely to know when we are wrong in the moral sphere than in\nthe physical sphere. Introspection and experience of the world were\nimportant assets in this respect. But, as Hume averred, \u201cnature\nwill forever elude our grasp\u201d, and even if we dig more deeply\ninto the microphysical realm, this would simply expose the need for\nfurther investigations.\n\nThe scientific spirit that Hume and Smith brought to their economics\nwas already present a century earlier; both Hobbes and Petty voiced\nthe aspiration of rendering morals into a quantitative discourse.\n\u201cCommercial mathematics\u201d took hold during the first half\nof the seventeenth century and many of the formal methods that have\nbecome commonplace in postwar economics were first adopted in the\nearly modern period (see Redman 1997; Sylla 2003). Blaise\nPascal\u2019s wager to believe in God (1670 [1910]) and Daniel\nBernoulli\u2019s Saint Petersburg paradox (1738 [1954]) are\npreliminary examples of decision theory (see Hutchison 1988). Both\nimposed probability measures on expected utilities and thus provided\nthe scaffolding of what has become an important line of inquiry in\nmainstream economics. Pierre de Fermat (1654) [1962] and Christiaan\nHuygens (1657) also studied games of chance (see Klein 1997). Game\ntheoretical modes of thinking permeated the works of Hobbes and Hume\n(see Hampton 1986; Kavka 1986; Hardin 2007). Hume also articulated\ncore elements of decision theory, including the idea of time\ndiscounting (see Diaye & Lapidus 2019; Sugden 2021).\n\nUndergirding these preliminary efforts at both decision theory and\ngame theory was a clear appreciation for strategic behavior, more or\nless a given among early modern philosophers following in the wake of\nMachiavelli. No one was more vocal on the widespread tendency to\nstrategize for individual gain than Mandeville. As he observed,\neveryone in commercial society was duplicitous, dressing to a higher\nstation, and rationalizing their frequent breach of ethical norms. It\nwas well known that the hand holding the scales of justice \u201chad\noften dropt \u2018em, brib\u2019d with Gold\u201d (Mandeville 1714\n[1988: 8]). Smith would echo these sentiments of duplicity:\n\n\ncivil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of\nproperty, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against\nthe poor, or of those who have some property against those who have\nnone at all. (Smith 1776 [1976: 715])\n\n\nIt is important to see that the rise of game theory in mainstream\neconomics since the mid-twentieth century is to some extent an\nunwitting revival of ascriptions of strategizing and power imbalances\nthat were commonplace in the early modern period.\n\nProbability theory was developed in the early modern period, notably\nby Huygens and Abraham de Moivre (see Daston 1988). The early\neighteenth-century English mathematician, John Arbuthnot, undertook\ncalculations that resembled Neyman-Pearson testing (see Stigler 1986:\n226). Hume may have copied this method, as a young admirer of\nArbuthnot. Hume\u2019s 100-page essay on population pivoted around\nthe null hypothesis that ancient Rome was more populated than Europe\nin 1750, and he ably demonstrated that the likelihood that this was\nthe case was vanishingly small. Hume may also have appreciated the\ninsights of Thomas Bayes, who devised his theorem\u2014now known as\nBayesianism\u2014in the 1750s, with a posthumous publication in 1764\n(see Raynor 1980).\n\nHume appealed explicitly to the law of large numbers and invoked a\nnumber of mean-reverting tendencies, as in his commitment to uniform\nwages, prices and interest rates. Quantitative efforts to measure\npopulation or the money supply were undertaken with much regularity\nstarting in the 1660s, despite a paucity of data (Endres 1985;\nDerringer 2018). Many, such as Graunt, understood the value of\ntrimming outliers and seeking what Thomas Simpson (1755) coined as the\narithmetic mean (see Stigler 1986; Klein 1997). Smith\u2019s analysis\nof the wage spectrum was grounded in the belief that market forces had\nestablished stable and salient wages for each type of trade, and that\ndeviations could be reduced down to his list of six key factors (Smith\n1776 [1976: 82\u2013104]).\n\nThere were some efforts at model building in the eighteenth century.\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Melon (1734), whose work was widely known,\nconstructed a model based on three similar islands with two goods in\ncirculation (see Hont 2005: 30\u201332). Quesnay\u2019s tableau\n\u00e9conomique (1758) was the most celebrated model. His\ndisciple, Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours, published a treatise in\n1768 that promoted physiocracy as a \u201cnew science\u201d on equal\nstanding with the natural sciences. Adam Smith intended to dedicate\nthe Wealth of Nations to Quesnay, but he died too soon.\n\nQuesnay\u2019s model made stylized assumptions about the French\nnation, ascribing three distinct classes: a quarter were landowners\n(aristocrats), a quarter artisans, and half farmers. He showed\nvisually that after the initial payment of rent (the annual net\nproduct) by the farmers to the landowners, the entire unfolding of the\neconomy would reach mathematical closure by the time of the next\nharvest and, like a perpetual motion machine, prompt the next period\nof production and distribution. No sector would increase or decrease\nin size and each would have its just reward in accordance with its\nstation (a stylized assumption was that landowners consumed twice as\nmuch as the others, per capita). Quesnay also, brilliantly, introduced\ndisturbances, for example, an unduly high interest rate, a tax, or an\nincreased demand for artisanal goods, to demonstrate the rapid\ndisequilibration of his system (see Quesnay 1758-1759). Contemporary\nmodelling thrives on introducing slight variations or manipulations to\ndisclose the underlying structure and is much indebted to Quesnay (see\nHausman 2003 [2021]; Morgan 2012).\n",
