    "main_text": "Mind and Object || Psychological Content versus Logical Content\n4.1 Psychological Content versus Logical Content\n\nIn his treatise \u201cOn Objects of Higher Order and Their\nRelationship to Internal Perception\u201d (1899) Meinong explicitly\nintroduces the distinction between the psychological (mental)\ncontent [psychologischer Inhalt] and the object\nof a representation [Gegenstand einer Vorstellung]\n\u2014 a fundamentally important distinction to him that he keeps on\nrefining and extending (subsequently applying it to all kinds\nof mental acts).\n\nMeinong\u2019s view on non-existent and impossible objects was\nsharpened by Twardowski 1894. Twardowski\u2019s work can be seen as\nthe occasion for Meinong to begin thinking more deeply about the\ncontent/object distinction, and indeed Meinong took over some of\nTwardowski\u2019s arguments. However, Meinong never thought that\nTwardowski\u2019s distinction and conception of the content of a\nrepresentation could be understood as a precise conceptual\nclarification that should be adopted unquestioningly. Meinong stated\nthat there was a great deal of interesting niand useful information in\nTwardowski\u2019s 1894 study, but he said this with respect to\n\u201cthe whole difficult and important problem of objects\u201d and\nnot exactly in relation to the difference between content and object\n(1899, \u00a72: 185 [141]). Meinong, for example, accepts\nTwardowski\u2019s critical attitude to the view that there are\nobjectless, empty representations, a thesis Bolzano put forward\n\u201cwith special emphasis\u201d (see the entry on\n Bernard Bolzano,\n Section 3.5). After 1894, Meinong took psychological contents as\nsomething purely mental and concrete. Such contents are therefore\nalways something real. Twardowski, however, says that the content is a\nmental picture, but he also identifies the mental content with the\nmeaning of a name and with Bolzano\u2019s objective representation\n(idea), i.e., the representation (idea) in itself, or as such,\n[Vorstellung an sich]. For that reason Twardowski (1894: 31\n[29]) takes the content \u2014 in contrast to the (real) act\n\u2014 as something that \u201calways lacks reality\u201d. Meinong,\nhowever, became more and more aware of the purely mental nature of the\npsychological content. He realized that the psychological content was\nnot something abstract or conceptual in the sense of something\nintensional, that it was not some sort of meaning at all.\n\nAccording to Meinong, all experiences [Erlebnisse], even the\nmost elementary ones, are complex mental phenomena, because they\ncontain at least three constituents: (1) the act, (2) the\n(psychological) content, and (3) the object of the experience. The\nfirst two components are intrinsically mental and, therefore, must\nexist if the experience exists, whereas the third one need not exist,\nand it is usually extrinsic to the mental. If somebody entertains a\nstrong hope for universal peace, for instance, then (1) the act of\nhope (and not of hate) exists, (2) the corresponding psychological\ncontent exists, but (3) no universal peace may occur (there is only\nthe non-existent object the universal peace). Meinong\nbelieves that experiences can have different objects\n[Gegenst\u00e4nde] for two reasons: (i) Different kinds of\nacts correspond to different kinds of objects (for example,\n\u201cobjecta\u201d correspond to representations, and\n\u201cobjectives\u201d to thoughts; see below 4.3.1). (ii) But\ninside an act, so to speak, any variation on the side of the objects\nis correlated with a variation of some mental component which is the\npsychological content of the experience. (See the supplement on\n Presentation of Objects via Psychological Content.)\n\nWhat is often called \u201ccontent\u201d, especially\n\u201cconceptual content\u201d, is not a Meinongian psychological\ncontent. Meinong distinguishes between psychological and logical (=\nconceptual) content in his later work, but he stresses the point that\nso-called \u201clogical content\u201d is \u201cnot [psychological]\ncontent but object or, more exactly, it is the proximate object\u201d\na psychological content is related to (1915: 163n). The psychological\ncontent of a presentation is not something abstract or intensional,\nwhereas the conceptual content is identified with the auxiliary\nobject, which is an incomplete object and which seems in a way akin to\na universal (1915, \u00a723: 163, \u00a728: 206, unpublished appendix\nin Meinong 1968\u201378, Vol. VI: 739\u201340; 1978: 368, 400; see\nalso Section 6 below). However, the connection to meaning, reference,\nand so-called \u201clogical content\u201d is guaranteed by\nMeinong\u2019s ideal relation of adequateness between the\npsychological content to its corresponding object, expounded in the\nsupplement below. Perhaps this is one reason why quite a number of\nMeinong\u2019s interpreters seem to bring Meinong\u2019s\npsychological content too close to the sphere of intensions.\nNevertheless, Meinong thinks that the introduced distinction between\nthe psychological content and its corresponding proximate object,\nwhich is the logical content, allows him to avoid psychologism.
