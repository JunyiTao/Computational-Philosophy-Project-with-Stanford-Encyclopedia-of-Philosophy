    "main_text": "Aristotle\n2. Aristotle\n\nTo see that the problem of the interpretation of spatiotemporal\nquantities as absolute or relative is endemic to almost any kind of\nmechanics one can imagine, we can look to one of the simplest theories\n\u2013 Aristotle\u2019s account of natural motion (e.g., On the\nHeavens I.2). According to this theory it is because of their\nnatures, and not because of \u2018unnatural\u2019 forces, that that\nheavy bodies move down, and \u2018light\u2019 things (air and fire)\nmove up; it is their natures, or \u2018forms\u2019, that constitute\nthe gravity or weight of the former and the levity of the latter. This\naccount only makes sense if \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019\ncan be unequivocally determined for each body. According to Aristotle,\nup and down are fixed by the position of the body in question relative\nto the center of the universe, a point coincident with the center of\nthe Earth. That is, the theory holds that heavy bodies naturally move\ntowards the center, while light bodies naturally move away.\n\nDoes this theory involve absolute or merely relative quantities? It\ndepends on the nature of the center. If the center were identified\nwith the center of the Earth, then the theory could be taken to eschew\nabsolute quantities: it would simply hold that the natural motions of\nany body depend on its position relative to another, namely the Earth.\nBut Aristotle is explicit that the center of the universe is not\nidentical with, but merely coincident with the center of the Earth\n(e.g., On the Heavens II.14): since the Earth itself is\nheavy, if it were not at the center it would move there! So the center\nis not identified with any body, and so perhaps direction-to-center is\nan absolute quantity in the theory, not understood fundamentally as\ndirection to some body (merely contingently as such if some body\nhappens to occupy the center). But this conclusion is not clear\neither. In On the Heavens II.13, admittedly in response to a\ndifferent issue, Aristotle suggests that the center itself is\n\u2018determined\u2019 by the outer spherical shell of the universe\n(the aetherial region of the fixed stars). If this is what he intends,\nthen the natural law prescribes motion relative to another body after\nall \u2013 namely up or down with respect to the mathematical center\nof the stars.\n\nIt would be to push Aristotle\u2019s writings too hard to suggest\nthat he was consciously wrestling with the issue of whether mechanics\nrequired absolute or relative quantities of motion, but what is clear\nis that these questions arise in his physics and his remarks impinge\non them. His theory also gives a simple model of how they arise: a\nphysical theory of motion will say that \u2018under such-and-such\ncircumstances, motion of so-and-so a kind will occur\u2019 \u2013\nand the question of whether that kind of motion makes sense in terms\nof the relations between bodies alone arises automatically. Aristotle\nmay not have recognized the question explicitly, but we see it as one\nissue in the background of his discussion of the center of the\nuniverse.\n",
