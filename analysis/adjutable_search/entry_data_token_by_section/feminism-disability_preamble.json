    "main_text": "\n\n\nTraditional philosophy paid almost no attention to the existence and\nexperiences of people who are physically or cognitively impaired.\nThat in the past philosophers only rarely took notice of disability is\nunderstandable, if not condonable. The general culture usually\nassociates disability with defectiveness, insufficiency, and\nimperfection, in other words, with states that philosophy throughout\nits history has mainly aimed to transcend or overcome. Traditionally,\nphilosophers rarely mentioned the kinds of impairments that are\nidentified with disabling conditions. And when they did mention\ndisability, their purpose almost always has been to invoke a limiting\ncase (Silvers et al. 1998, 3), for example, babies so deformed as to\nvitiate the value of human life (Kuhse and Singer 1986), or adults too\ndependent and noncontributing to be parties to the social\ncontract (Rawls 1985).\n\n\nOver the last half century, however, scholarship in many disciplines\nhas come to appreciate the broader significance of difference. In this\nspirit, philosophers began to question the preeminence assigned to\nnormalcy, and the concomitant devaluation of the physical and\ncognitive conditions considered to be disabilities (Canguilhem\n1989). Recently, feminist thinkers moved into the forefront of this\nturn of interest in disability, sometimes prompted by their\nphilosophical commitment to inclusiveness, and sometimes by\npersonal encounters with disability. Disability perspectives have\nbecome familiar in feminist approaches to some philosophical topics,\nfor instance, ethics and justice theory, and the metaphysics of\nembodiment. Feminist approaches to other topics, such as models and\nstandards of knowing, might also benefit by being enlarged to include\ndisability perspectives.\n",
