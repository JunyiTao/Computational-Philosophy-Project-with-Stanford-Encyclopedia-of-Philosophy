Sexual Difference\n\nThe descriptions which Beauvoir offers us of the female body as lived,\nare in marked contrast to the valorization of that body which we find\nin the writings of sexual difference theorists: \u201cWhat is at\nstake in the debate \u2026 is the positive project of turning\ndifference into a strength, of affirming its positivity\u201d\n(Braidotti 1994: 187). Engagement with female embodiment, the goal of\nwhich is to give positive accounts of it, are found in two different\nstrands of feminist thought: Anglo-American radical feminism\n(particularly in the late 1970s and 80s) and psychoanalytic feminism,\ndrawing on the work of Freud and Lacan. Sexual difference theorists,\nwhether working from a radical feminist tradition or from a\npsychoanalytic feminist tradition, insist on the specificity of female\nembodiment, a horizon which becomes invisible when the male is taken\nas the norm of the human. For many of these theorists sexual\ndifference is fundamental and immutable. Braidotti claims \u201cbeing\na woman is always already there as the ontological precondition for my\nexistential becoming as a subject\u201d (1994: 187).\n",
