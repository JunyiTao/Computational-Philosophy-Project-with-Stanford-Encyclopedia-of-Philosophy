    "main_text": "The Topoi || Rhetorical Topoi\n7.4 Rhetorical Topoi\n\nEven though there are good reasons for thinking that the nature and\nuse of topoi in Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric are based\non his elaborate account of dialectical topoi in the\nTopics (see above\n \u00a7 7.2\n and\n \u00a7 7.3),\n commentators are faced with the difficulty that the use of the word\n\u2018topos\u2019 in Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is\nmuch more heterogeneous than in the Topics. Beside\ntopoi which do perfectly comply with the description given in\nthe Topics, there is an important group of topoi in\nthe Rhetoric that are not topic-neutral and hence do not\ncontain instructions for arguments of a certain logical form, but\nrather with a certain predicate (for example, that something is good,\nor honourable, or just, or contributes to happiness, etc.). While\nthose latter \u2018material\u2019 topoi so to speak are,\nafter all, used to construe arguments, there are also mentions of\nso-called \u2018topoi\u2019 in the context of the\nnon-argumentative means of persuasion, which might be taken as\nprocedural instructions, but no longer seem to be concerned with the\nconstruction of arguments, which was the one and only function of\ndialectical topoi.\n\nSupplement on the Variety of Topoi in the Rhetoric\n\n\nIn addition to the more heterogenous use of the word\n\u2018topos\u2019 in the Rhetoric (which might\noriginate from Aristotle\u2019s attempt to combine his own\ndialectical use of the term with more traditional rhetorical uses),\nthere is the problem of the controversial distinction in\nRhet. I.2, 1358a2\u201335 between topoi (which are\nunderstood to be general/common) on the one hand and certain specific\ndevices (idia) on the other. While Aristotle seems inclined\nto call the general or common topoi simply\n\u2018topoi\u2019, he uses several names for the opposing,\nspecific items (e.g. idiai protaseis, idia,\neid\u00ea). This distinction has a major impact on the\nstructure of the Rhetoric as a whole (see above\n \u00a7 2),\n in that it is responsible for the occurence of \u2018specific\u2019\ninstructions, premises, \u2018topoi\u2019 or whatever in\nthe bulk of the first book and the occurence of \u2018common\u2019\ntopoi in the second part of the second book. Traditionally,\nthis distinction has been understood as a division between\ngeneral/common topoi on the one hand and specific\ntopoi on the other (the traditional view has been defended\namong others by Cope 1877 and Rapp 2002). However, it is unclear (i)\nwhat the opposition between general/common and specific refers to,\n(ii) where in the Rhetoric the common topoi can be\nfound and (iii) whether the distinction is meant to be a distinction\nbetween topoi in the first place, since even though Aristotle\ndistinguishes topoi that are common from specific\n(idia) rhetorical devices, he never explicitly uses the\nphrase \u2018specific topoi\u2019, as one might expect on\nthe traditional reading.\n\nAs for (i), Aristotle points out in Rhet. I.2 that some\nthings are specific to physics, others to ethics, etc. This seems to\nsuggest a distinction between topoi (or other building blocks\nof arguments) that are peculiar to the different sciences on the one\nhand and other topoi that are not, but are instead applicable\nto all sciences and fields of knowledge alike\u2014just as (most of)\nthe dialectical topoi of the Topics are. However,\nfrom Rhet. I.3 on, Aristotle makes the readers think, by\ncontrast, that \u2018specific\u2019 refers to the different genres\nof rhetoric, so that some topoi are specific to deliberative,\nothers to epideictic, and still others to juridical speech.\nCorrespondingly, this would require a sense of\nbeing\u2018common\u2019 that boils down to saying that they are not\nspecific to one single species of speech, but that does not amount to\nthe topic-neutrality of the dialectical topoi.\n\nWith regard to (ii), it is generally agreed that the specific\ntopoi can be found in the first book of the Rhetoric\nand the common topoi in the second. Most commentators assume\nthat all common topoi are listed in chapters II.23\u201324\n(real enthymemes in II.23, fallacious enthymemes in II.24). However,\nit is less common to count the items listed in II.19 (about the\npossible/impossible, past and future facts, significance and\ninsignificance) as common topoi, which might be due to the\ncontroversy mentioned in (i) about the required sense of being\n\u2018common\u2019, for the topoi in II.19 are applicable\nto all genres of speech, but are most probably not common in the way\nthe dialectical topoi are. In addition, it is important to\nnotice that even chapter II.23, which is undisputedly dedicated to\ncommon topoi, is a mixed bag, for it includes some\ntopoi, especially in the first third of the chapter, that,\nbeing topic-neutral, thoroughly correspond to dialectical\ntopoi and even might be generally applicable as the\ndialectical topoi are, while some other topoi\nmentioned in II.23 are quite different in style, as they are taken\nfrom extant historical speeches.\n\nThe most difficult debates are posed by (iii), as the traditional\ninterpretation is based on some fragile assumptions. Not only does\nAristotle never call the specific items \u2018topoi\u2019\nby name, it is also significant that the specific items that are\nlisted in Rhet. I.5-15 often have the form of mere\npropositions or premises rather than of topoi as we know them\nfrom the Topics (see above\n \u00a7 7.3).\n This is why several authors insist that the distinction between\ntopoi, which are thought to be common, and idia is\nnot a distinction between different types of topoi, but\nbetween topoi and something else, most notably premises,\ncommonly accepted premises or premises established by the arts. This\nobjection comes in several versions. (a) Several authors subscribed to\nthe view of Solmsen 1929 that there are two types of enthymemes,\nrespresenting different stages in the development of Aristotle\u2019s\nlogical thinking insofar as some are taken from topoi\n(deriving from Aristotle\u2019s early- pre-syllogistic logic) and\nsome are built from premises through the figures of the syllogism\n(thus presupposing syllogistic logic), not from topoi.\nAccording to this view, the specific topoi given in the first\nbook of the Rhetoric are the premises of the latter type of\nenthymemes, and the enthymemes of the former type are taken only from\ncommon topoi. From this point of view, only common\ntopoi would be topoi in the proper sense, while\nspecific topoi would be, strictly speaking, nothing but\npremises. Accordingly, one would expect to find propositions of the\nform \u201cAll F are just/noble/good\u201d in the first\nbook of the Rhetoric; with such propositions one could\nconstrue syllogisms like \u201cAll F are\njust/noble/good\u2014This particular x is\nF\u2014This particular x is just/noble/good.\u201d\nAgainst Solmsen it has been objected that what one actually gets in\nthe first book hardly fits Solmsen\u2019s model. In some sense one\nfinds more than the required premises in that Aristotle gives here not\nonly isolated propositions, but also certain propositions together\nwith a reason or a justification. Furthermore, chapters I.6\u20137 of\nthe Rhetoric offer topoi which can also be found in\nthe third book of Topics; in the Topics they are\nclearly called \u2018topoi\u2019, so that there is less\npressure to think that they are premises rather than topoi.\n(b) Grimaldi 1958 requires that in order to build a rhetorical\nargument one needs the logical form of an argument provided by the\ntopoi plus the material (content) provided by the specific\npremises or idia. A more refined version of this\n\u2018complementarity\u2019-view has been suggested by Rubinelli\n2009, who, however, also allows of the possibility that some\nenthymemes are taken only from the topoi, while others are\nonly taken from the idia. Against Grimaldi\u2019s view it is\nhas been objected that many of the common topoi listed in\nchapters II.23\u201324 are not based on linguistic, semantic or\nlogical categories as the topic-neutral topoi of the\nTopics are. Some of them only offer strategic advice, for\nexample, to turn what has been said against oneself upon the one who\nsaid it. For this reason, it would be misleading to interpret the\ncommon topoi of the Rhetoric as providing logical\nschemes of inference. (c) Havrda 2019 has attacked the presuppositions\nof the traditional view, but does not settle for the alternatives\nsuggested by Solmsen, Grimaldi or Rubinelli either. According to him,\nAristotle never distinguishes between common and specific\ntopoi. Rather, he distinguishes between two different sources\nof rhetorical deductions; one source, the dialectical one, uses\ntopoi, while the other, which is based on definitions\nprovided by arts and sciences, does not.\n",
