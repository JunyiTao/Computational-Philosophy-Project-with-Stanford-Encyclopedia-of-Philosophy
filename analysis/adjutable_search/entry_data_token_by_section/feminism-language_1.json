    "main_text": "Critical work on language and philosophy of language || Invisibility of women\n1.2 Invisibility of women\n\nFeminist concerns, however, go beyond mere classificatory ones.\nFeminists have also argued that terms like \u2018he\u2019 and\n\u2018man\u2019 contribute to making women invisible\u2014that is,\nto obscuring women\u2019s importance, and distracting attention from\ntheir existence. Fighting the invisibility of women is an important\nfeminist project in many\n areas,[1]\n and language that makes one less likely to think of women clearly\ncontributes to this invisibility. There is good psycholinguistic\nevidence that those who encounter sentences (like\n (3)\n and\n (4))\n using the terms \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 think more\nreadily of males than of\n females.[2]\n If this is right, then the use of these words can be seen as\ncontributing to the invisibility of women. This gives feminists a good\nreason to object to the \u2018gender-neutral\u2019 use of these\nterms.\n",
