    "main_text": "Is Equality Desirable Per Se? Alternatives to Egalitarianism || Priority\n6.2 Priority\n\n\nThere is another route to the conclusion that equality per se is not\nmorally valuable. Consider again the scenario in which the poorest\ninhabitants of the earth face grim and miserable conditions of\nexistence and the richest enjoy an enormously better quality of life.\nThe sufficientarian's diagnosis of this situation is that what is bad\nabout this scenario is not the inequality, the gap between rich and\npoor, but the fact that the poor do not have enough. An alternative\ndiagnosis can most easily be explained by supposing that we have a\ncardinal interpersonal measure of welfare or well-being. An\nindividual's level of well-being registers how well her life is going\nas it would be assessed from the standpoint of rational prudence. An\nindividual's level of well-being is the level of benefits or advantages\nfor herself that her life contains. From this perspective, when one\nspeaks of \u201cbetter off\u201d and \u201cworse off\u201d persons, one is speaking of\npersons whose lifetime level of well-being is high or low.\n\n\nWith this bit of background in place, the idea that transfers of\nresources from better off to worse off persons are sometimes morally\ndesirable can be understood without supposing either that equality of\nany sort is per se desirable or that there is some level of well-being\nthat marks the good enough level and that has a special status as\nspecified by the sufficiency doctrine. Suppose that for any person, the\nlower her lifetime well-being score\u2014the amount of well-being she\ngains or is now expected to gain over the course of her life\u2014the\nmore morally valuable it would be to secure an incremental gain of\nwell-being for her (or to avoid a small loss). This is the root idea of\nprioritarianism.\n\n\nThe prioritarian idea is to be sharply distinguished from the idea\nthat across some range, resources secured for a person have declining\nmarginal utility. To illustrate, suppose one person is leading a\nhellish existence and another is leading a life of sheer bliss. We\nmight think that a single unit of some generally useful resource such\nas water is likely to do more good, result in a greater aggregate of\nwell-being among all persons, if the unit is provided to the person\nsuffering in hell rather than the person enjoying heavenly bliss. This\nmay be so. The straight utilitarian of well-being will then favor\nprovision of the unit of water to the inhabitant of hell. Now suppose\ninstead that a unit of some resource would provide exactly the same\nincrease in well-being if it is provided either to the person leading\nthe hellish or the person leading the blissful life. (Perhaps the\nperson already in bliss is a very efficient transformer of resources\ninto personal well-being.) The prioritarian gives priority to getting\nbenefits to those whose well-being level is low, so will favor helping\nthe miserable rather than the lucky person even if the well-being\naggregate is thereby reduced a bit, compared to what it would have been\nif the resource had been channeled to the blissful person.\n\n\nPrioritarianism holds that the moral value of achieving a benefit\nfor an individual (or avoiding a loss) is greater, the greater the size\nof the benefit as measured by a well-being scale, and greater, the\nlower the person's level of well-being over the course of her life\napart from receipt of this benefit. Well-being weighted by priority as\njust specified is sometimes called \u201cweighted well-being.\u201d To this\naccount of value the prioritarian adds the position that one ought to\nact, and institutions should be arranged, so as to maximize moral value\nas defined. (See chapter 2 of Scheffler 1982, Weirich 1983, Parfit\n1997).\n\n\nPrioritarianism is not vulnerable to the leveling down objection, so\nif one finds that objection decisive against any position that takes\nequality of any sort to be non-instrumentally valuable, priority looks\nto be an ethically attractive alternative. Political conservatives\nsometimes conjecture that the rancorous emotion of envy fuels the\nimpulse to egalitarian movements. With respect to a possible good and\nyour having it or my having it or both of us or neither of us having\nit, if I am an envious person, I prefer my having it rather than your\nhaving it and also prefer neither of us having it to your having it.\nThe prioritarian judgments as to what ought to be done do not reflect\nthe preferences of the envious. (Clarification: Envy as just described\ncorresponds to the ordinary common-sense notion of envy as a vice,\nwhich should be sharply distinguished from the bland preference\nconstitutive of the No-envy fairness criterion. These are different\nideas.)\n\n\nAnother attractive feature of prioritarianism is that it promises to\ncombine in a single determinate principle the values of well-being\nmaximization and priority for the badly off. So elaborated, the\npriority doctrine would contain a solution to the problem of\nintegrating the values of efficiency and equality broadly understood.\nBut this advantage is just notional pending a determination of how to\nweight the competing values of well-being gains and priority in a\nsingle principle. As stated, the priority doctrine does not specify a\ndeterminate principle but a family of principles. At one extreme,\nhardly any weight is given to priority as it competes with maximizing\nwell-being, and the prioritarian doctrine is then barely\ndistinguishable from straight act utilitarianism with utility\nidentified with well-being. At the other extreme, hardly any weight is\ngiven to maximizing well-being as it competes with priority, and the\nprioritarian doctrine is then barely distinguishable from the maximin\nprinciple with well-being as the maximand. (Maximin holds that one\nshould choose that policy, among the alternatives, that brings about\nthe best position for the worst off individual affected by the policy\nchoice.)\n\n\nThe priority doctrine has been explicated as a version of welfarism.\nOne can see that the prioritarian idea itself is separable from any\ncommitment to welfarism. In general terms, the prioritarian holds that\nthe moral value of gaining a benefit for a person is greater, the lower\nthe benefit level of the person prior to receipt of the increment, and\ngreater, the greater the size of the benefit. So stated, the doctrine\nadmits of various interpretations that put different constructions on\nthe idea of \u201cgreater benefit.\u201d For example, if benefit is identified\nwith the Rawlsian idea of a primary social good, and one takes\nprioritarianism beyond its limit to maximin, one then has the Rawlsian\nconception, that justice in most general terms is bringing about the\nbest possible outcome for the very worst off. (See Rawls 1971, chapter\n2, and for a defense of maximin, J. Cohen 1989.)\n\n\nAs characterized here, priority says one ought always to choose the\nact that maximizes the moral value that is brought about, with moral\nvalue being larger, the larger the benefit one brings about for a\nperson, and larger, the worse off the person would be absent this\nbenefit over the course of her life. A challenge to priority, raising a\ndoubt against the thought that morality should dispense with any\nrelational equality concern, points out that priority says that if\none's acts can affect only oneself, one morally must do the act\nthat maximizes one's lifetime benefit level. Here priority and\nprudence coincide in their dictates as to what one should do. But\nsuppose the acts one can choose are risky, they might produce better or\nworse outcomes. A natural extension of priority says that when\none's choices are risky and affect others, one should be risk\naverse, the degree of risk aversion that is called for depending on how\nmuch weight should be assigned to getting benefits to a person, the\nworse off the person is. So far, so good. But priority applies to the\nchoice of a single person whose acts affect only himself: Consider\nRobinson Crusoe alone on an island. He can choose to swim, which would\nbe fun but carries some risk of being eaten by a shark and dying\nimmediately, or instead climb coconut trees on the beach, less fun but\ncarrying no risk of harm as grave as a shark attack. Rational prudence,\nwe think, does not dictate that Crusoe be conservative in his choices\nby giving extra weight to the outcome in which he suffers low lifetime\nwell-being. Prudence permits Crusoe to be risk-loving, risk-averse, or\nrisk-neutral is deciding among options such as swim with the sharks or\nclimb on the safe beach. But the natural extension of priority makes it\na strict moral requirement that he be risk-averse, giving extra weight\n(above and beyond what his own preferences dictate) to avoiding the\noutcome in which death right away induces low lifetime well-being. That\nseems odd. We might respond by saying that egalitarian values only come\ninto play in dictating what we ought to do when our acts affect other\npeople, and thus affect how badly off or well off people are relative\nto each other. When choices affect only the self, following ordinary\nprudence is fine. That response abandons extended priority and\nchallenges the idea that priority captures our moral convictions\nregarding why there is extra moral reason to help those who are worse\noff than others (see Otsuka and Voorhoeve 2009).\n\n\nThe prioritarian can choose among several ways to stave off the\nOtsuka and Voorhoeve challenge. The most sensible response may be\nsimply to bite the bullet and, in effect, acknowledge that Crusoe has\nspecial reason to avoid the sharks. This does not mean that taking\nrisks that would bring it about that one's absolute well-being\nlevel is low is never or seldom rational. Dangerous sports, after all,\ncan provide sublime experience. In fact, accepting a slight risk of a\nfatal car crash by driving across town to get better quality bread,\nwhen one's available choices affect only oneself, may be\nperfectly rational. But priority tells us to put a thumb on the scale\nso as to favor avoiding very bad life outcomes. It is difficult to\nassess the acceptability of this implication of the doctrine pending\nsome specification of the priority weights as they bear on decision\nmaking.\n",
