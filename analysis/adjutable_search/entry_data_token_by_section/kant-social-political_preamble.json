    "main_text": "\n\nKant wrote his social and political philosophy in order to champion\nthe Enlightenment in general and the idea of freedom in particular.\nHis work came within both the natural law and the social contract\ntraditions. Kant held that every rational being had both an innate\nright to freedom and a duty to enter into a civil condition governed\nby a social contract in order to realize and preserve that\nfreedom.\n\nHis writings on political philosophy consist of one book and several\nshorter works. The \u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d, Part One of his\ntwo-part Metaphysics of Morals and first published as a\nstand-alone book in February 1797, contains virtually every directly\npolitical topic he treats. Other shorter works include a useful short\nsummary of his discussion of the basis and role of the state in the\nsecond section of the essay \u201cTheory and Practice\u201d, an\nextended discussion of international relations in the essay\n\u201cToward Perpetual Peace\u201d, and the essay \u201cAn Answer\nto the Question: What is Enlightenment?.\u201d Other published\nmaterial relevant to the topics include material on history, on\npractical philosophy in general, and, for his social philosophy, his\nwork on religion, education, and anthropology. Kant also offered a\nbiennial lecture course on \u201cNatural Right\u201d, a\nstudent\u2019s (Feyerabend) transcript of which is available in\nEnglish translation.\n",
