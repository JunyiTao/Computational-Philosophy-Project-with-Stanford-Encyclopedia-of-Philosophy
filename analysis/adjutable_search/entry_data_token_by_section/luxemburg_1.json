    "main_text": "Social reform or revolution\n2. Social reform or revolution\n\n\nRosa Luxemburg established herself as a major\nintellectual figure in Marxist circles with her intervention in the\nrevisionist controversy, the theoretical and political debate around\nthe principles and aims of social-democracy that divided the Second\nInternational at the turn of the 19th century. The debate\nwas sparked by Eduard Bernstein, Friedrich Engels\u2019s close friend,\ncollaborator and literary executor, as well as a senior figure in the\nGerman Social Democratic Party. It unfolded first in a series of\narticles published between 1896 and 1898 in Die Neue Zeit,\nthen subsequently consolidated in a volume entitled The\nPreconditions of Socialism (1899). As the Prussian government\nprogressively relaxed the Anti-Socialist laws promoted by the then\nchancellor Otto von Bismarck, and social democratic ranks continued to\nswell, Bernstein tried to revisit some of the core theoretical and\npolitical commitments of Marxism by offering a new analysis of the\ntransformation of capitalism in the fifty years following the\npublication of Marx and Engels\u2019s Communist Manifesto. He\ncriticised one of the fundamental pillars of Marxian economics: that\nthe historical tendency of the rate of profit to fall under the twin\npressure of technological modernisation and an increasingly exploited\nlabour force rendered inevitable the crisis of the system. This,\nBernstein argued, required social-democrats to abandon their\nrevolutionary aims in favour of enacting progressive legislation which\nsought to represent workers through parliamentary struggle. He insisted\nthat this was no subversion of the teachings of the founding fathers,\nbut rather an effort to liberate Marxism from the dialectical\nstraightjacket in which many socialists of the Second International had\nsubsequently placed it.\n\n\nThe debate centred around the question of whether\ndemocracy and capitalism were compatible. The starting point for\nBernstein\u2019s critique was the Marxist claim that capitalism was a\nsocial system with a tendency to collapse under the pressure of its own\ncontradictions. In the pages of Capital, Marx had written\neloquently about how capitalist economies faced the prospect of ever\nmore destructive crises due to the twin pressures of technological\nmodernisation and the tendency of the rate of profits to fall. At the\ntime of Bernstein\u2019s contribution, this methodological commitment\nto understanding capital as a system with an inherent propensity\ntowards crisis was widely shared among the main theorists of the Second\nInternational. To suggest that the argument was false was to strike at\nthe core of Marxist political economy. But what made the attack\nparticularly uncomfortable, and difficult to dismiss, was that\nBernstein presented his argument not as a break with Marxist\nmethodological assumptions but as an internal development of its\nnormative and empirical requirements. He began by insisting that\ndialectics was nothing other than the methodological commitment to\nmatch one\u2019s theory to new developments in practice. The history\nof capitalist development in the 19th century showed not a\ncumulative series of ever sharper failures but a resilient system with\na surprising capacity for adaptation. From an economic perspective\nthere were a number of new developments with which the Marxist analysis\nhad to reckon: the intensification of foreign trade, the expansion of\nthe banking and financial sector, the development of the credit system,\nand the emergence of cartels and trusts. From a political perspective,\nthe consolidation of middle classes, the rise of property owners, and\nthe expansion of the franchise meant that liberal representation could\nno longer be identified with the perpetuation of oppression by ruling\nelites. There was now reasonable hope that the gap between the private\nand the public sphere, between the ethos of the bourgeois and\nthat of the citoyen could be bridged. On the one hand, the\nextension of the right to vote to previously disenfranchised categories\nof people; on the other hand the strengthening of workers\u2019 unions\nand cooperatives as well as the prospects of electoral successes for\nmass social-democratic parties across Western Europe made it hard to\nequate representative democracy with the consolidation of class rule.\n Citizenship emerged as the new concept through which capital\ncould be put to the service of the democratic state. Representative\ndemocracy and political emancipation were part of the same project, a\nproject that social-democrats could develop regardless of\n\u201cthe final goal.\u201d\n\n\nRosa Luxemburg was not the only one to protest against\nBernstein\u2019s reinterpretation of Marxism. His position was\ndiscussed (and rejected) at the Stuttgart Conference of the German\nSocial Democratic party (1898) where more established members of the\nSPD, including Karl Kautsky and August Bebel, also spoke against his\nthesis. Luxemburg\u2019s intervention, which appeared partially in\narticle form in Leipziger Volkszeitung, and was subsequently\npublished in 1900 under the title Social Reform or Revolution\n(second edition 1908) was, however, a point-by-point response. Her\ncritique targeted Bernstein\u2019s arguments as synthesised in the\nfamous (or infamous) dictum: \u201cthe final goal is nothing to me,\nthe movement is everything.\u201d\n\n\nThis, Luxemburg explained, was a false dilemma.  \u201cCan\nSocial-Democracy be against reforms? Can we contrapose the social\nrevolution, the transformation of the existing order, our final goal,\nto social reforms? Certainly not.\u201d At the heart of\nBernstein\u2019s dilemma, she suggested, was not a tactical choice, a\nsimple discussion about this or that method of struggle; it was the\n\u201cvery existence of the Social Democratic movement\u201d as a\ndistinctive force in the struggle against capitalism (Luxemburg\n1900 [RLR: 129]).\n\n\nBut just like Bernstein\u2019s arguments were\ngrounded in apparently Marxist theory so was Luxemburg\u2019s\nresponse. She was committed to the idea that socialism is a\n\u201chistoric necessity\u201d, a theory whose desirability is\ndictated by the correct interpretation of empirical circumstances.\n\u201cEither revisionism is correct concerning the course of\ncapitalist development, and therefore socialism becomes a\nutopia\u201d, she wrote, or \u201csocialism is not a utopia; and\ntherefore the theory of the means of adaptation is false\u201d\n(Luxemburg 1900 [RLR: 134]).\n\n\nTo illustrate the latter, her analysis combined\neconomic and political arguments and focused on the structure of\nglobalization and the role of nation-states in a financialized economic\nsystem. The conclusions reached however were opposite to those of\nBernstein. While Bernstein had interpreted the development of the\ncredit and debit system as stabilising mechanisms within a capitalist\norder, for Luxemburg the concentration of economic power by monopoly\nholders, corporations, banks and other financial institutions were\nsymptoms of vulnerability rather than an asset. In response to\nBernstein\u2019s remarks on the role of credit in avoiding capitalist\ncollapse, she emphasized that financial capitalism and the availability\nof loans aggravates crisis rather than providing a solution to it.\nCredit, Luxemburg argued, encourages speculation and widens the gap\nbetween what might be called the real and the fictitious economy.\nIndeed, while credit initially stimulates the development of productive\nforces, it can also lead to errors of calculation and overproduction,\ntherefore ceasing to be helpful in the exchange process at the first\nsymptom of stagnation. Likewise, cartels and trusts, and the other\nregulatory mechanisms designed to increase coordination among the\nholders of capital can only succeed by eliminating internal competition\nin isolated industries, something that cannot be extended to all\nsectors of production. Moreover, cartels succeed at increasing the rate\nof profit in internal markets only in virtue of expansion outwards, by\nselling abroad the products that cannot be absorbed by domestic demand.\nIn other words, Luxemburg explained, these companies are only able to\nsell abroad, at lower rates of profit, the product that cannot be\nabsorbed by domestic markets. The other face of apparent market\nstability in Europe is sharpened competition abroad and anarchy on the\nworld market \u2013 the opposite of what cartels intended to achieve. When\nthe global market begins to shrink because it has been exhausted by\ncompetition between capitalist countries, the capital that has been\nsocialised through organisation reverts to private capital and\nemployers organisations \u201cburst like soap bubbles and give way to\nfree competition in aggravated form\u201d (Luxemburg 1900 [RLR:\n137]). \n\n\nFrom a political perspective, Luxemburg maintained, work for reforms\nshould not be understood as \u201ca drawn-out revolution,\u201d and\nrevolution should not be understood as \u201ca condensed series of\nreforms.\u201d Historically, legal reform, she explaned, has served\nthe purpose of consolidating an emerging social class until the\nbalance of political forces is such that the existing juridical\nrelations can be eventually dismantled in favor of new ones. Every\nlegal order, she maintained, emerges out of a social and political\nrevolution: \u201crevolution is the act of political creation while\nlegislation is the political expression of a society that has already\ncome into being\u201d (Luxemburg 1900 [RLR: 156]). This is precisely\nwhat the terms \u201creform\u201d and \u201crevolution\u201d mean:\nthey suggest a radical change in the content of fundamental legal\ndispositions rather than in the manner of their realization. Legal\nreform and revolution are not different methods of historical progress\nthat \u201ccan be picked out from the counter of history as one picks\nout hot or cold sausages\u201d (Luxemburg 1900 [RLR: 156]). Those who\noppose the method of legal reform to the goal of conquering political\npower by the workers do not oppose \u201ca more tranquil, calmer and\nslower method to the same goal\u201d; they choose \u201ca different\ngoal\u201d (Luxemburg 1900 [RLR: 157]). They choose to operate within\nthe legal framework dictated by the old order instead of committing to\nestablish a new one. The political analysis of revisionism produces a\nsimilar outcome to its economic analysis: it abandons the commitment\nto socialism in favour of the preservation of capitalism, and tries to\nreduce abuses in the system rather than eliminating the system itself.\nTo achieve the more radical outcome, it is essential for the\nproletariat to have access to political power. The fate of democracy,\nLuxemburg insisted, is \u201cbound up with the fate of the labour\nmovement\u201d. While the advocacy of reforms via parliamentary and\ntrade union mechanisms would prepare the working classes for the\nexercise of political power, the fact that these demands were\ninscribed in a liberal institutional framework made it impossible to\novercome capitalism from within. The reformist method ended up pitting\nsocialism against democracy without understanding the nature of legal\nrevolutions. In turning the dispute from one of content of legal\ndispositions to one of style of execution, it ended up losing sight of\nboth.\n",
