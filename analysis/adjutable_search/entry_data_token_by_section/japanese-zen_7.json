    "main_text": "Overcoming Dualism\n5. Overcoming Dualism\n\nAccordingly, Zen demands that the practitioner overcome the dualism\noperative in the everyday standpoint, which it speaks of by using the\nphrase \u201cnot two.\u201d The use of the phrase \u201cnot\ntwo\u201d expresses Zen\u2019s proclivity to favor the simple and\nthe concrete, such that it is not expressed as a negation of\ndualism. This overcoming is an existential, practical\nproject, a goal for the Zen practitioner, although it is paradoxically\nstated as \u201cif you face it, it goes away.\u201d This is because\n\u201cfacing\u201d presupposes a dualistic stance. \u201cTwo\u201d\nin \u201cnot two\u201d designates any \u201ctwo\u201d things\nappearing from within the everyday standpoint, especially when it is\ntaken to designate an absolute sense of reality. This standpoint, as\nmentioned in the foregoing, relies on the discursive mode of reasoning\nto understand reality, while presupposing an ego-consciousness as the\nstandard referential point. From this perspective for example, a\ndistinction between the outer and inner worlds emerges, using a\nsensory perception as the point of reference. One of the salient\ncharacteristics of this standpoint is that the world appears to be\ndualistic in nature, that is to say, it recognizes two (and\nby implication, many) things to be real. Zen questions this standpoint\nwhen it is used as the paradigm for daily living, including\nphilosophical thinking, for this standpoint accepts as its foundation\nan individual\u2019s discrete \u201cI\u201d with a belief that\n\u201cI\u201d am self-contained and self-sufficient, and therefore\nam distinguished and isolated from other individuals and things of\nnature, \u201cI\u201d am \u201chere\u201d and things, including\nothers, are \u201cover there,\u201d creating both a psychological\nand physical distance between them. Epistemologically speaking, Zen\nobserves that this renders opaque, or at best translucent, the\nexperiential domains beyond the sensible world as well as\nego-consciousness, both either taken naturalistically or by means of\ntheoretical speculation. The inability to go beyond these experiential\ndomains occurs because ego-consciousness is physiologically rooted in\nthe body and psychologically in the unconscious. This points to a\nphilosophically important consequence. Namely, once the practitioner\naccepts this outer-inner dichotomy even provisionally, he or she is\nled to accept as true a host of other \u201ctwo\u201d things that\nare affirmed to be real, as is seen in pairs of opposites such as mind\nvs. body, I vs. others, love vs. hate, good\nvs. evil, and I vs. nature.\n",
