    "main_text": "Further Arguments for EC, with some Non-Contextualist Responses || The Social Role of Knowledge Ascriptions\n6. Views Similar to EC\nWe have seen that the arrival of EC prompted non-contextualist epistemologists to give more attention to such matters as the psychology and pragmatics of knowledge attributions, and various other features of our actual knowledge-attributing practices. EC has also been instrumental in the development of other competing theories. These are said by their proponents to do a better job of accommodating the data which inspire EC. These views are:\n\nContrastivism, of which Jonathan Shaffer (e.g., 2004) is the leading proponent (but see too Karjalainen and Morton 2003).\nSubject Sensitive Invariantism or Interest Relative Invariantism\u2014defended, in various forms, by Jeremy Fantl and Matt McGrath (2002, 2007, 2009), John Hawthorne (2004), and Jason Stanley (2005b).\nRelativism, of the sort defended by John MacFarlane (2005; 2014, Chapter 8).\n\nAccording to Contrastivism, \u2018knows\u2019 denotes a three-place relation, with a contrast variable included among the relata. The identity of the contrasted propositions may be \u2018shifty\u2019 when not explicitly provided. Thus, in the same way that an utterance of \u2018Jane prefers vanilla\u2019 may express a true proposition when the contextually-provided contrast is strawberry but a false proposition when the contrast is chocolate, \u2018Jane knows that she has hands\u2019 may be true when the contrast is her having lost her hands in an accident, but false when the contrast is her being a handless BIV. (Some see contrastivism as a species of EC; for Schaffer on the differences between Contrastivism and canonical versions of EC, see his 2004.)\nAccording to Subject Sensitive Invariantism, whether a subject knows depends upon facts about his/her practical interests (or, depending on the view, what the subject believes about such), especially the degree of practical importance of getting things right. As a rule, on this view, the more that\u2019s at stake the harder it is to know.\nAccording to Relativism about knowledge, the truth values of \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentences depend upon the standards in play in the contexts in which they are assessed, as opposed to the standards operative in either the context in which they are uttered or the context of the subject. (When the assessor is identical to the subject of the \u201cknowledge\u201d attribution these standards of course coincide.)\nThe various strengths and weakness of each of these views \u2014 considered both on their own and as compared with each other, with EC, and with traditional (insensitive) Invariantism\u2014is the subject of much recent debate. And lively discussion of EC itself continues. (See, for example, the papers collected in Ichikawa 2017b.)\n",
