    "main_text": "Splitting logics versus splicing logics\n2. Splitting logics versus splicing logics\n\nIt is reasonable to expect that a method for combining logics would\nwork in two opposite directions: on the one hand, a logic that one\nwants to investigate could be decomposed into factors of lesser\ncomplexity; for instance, a bimodal alethic-deontic logic could be\ndecomposed into its alethic and deontic fragments. In this case, it\nwould be relevant to see if the logic under investigation is the least\nextension of its factors, or if additional bridge principles would\nhave to be added. This approach, in which a given logic is decomposed\ninto (possibly) simpler factors, is said to be a process of\nsplitting logics.\n\nOn the other hand, one might be interested in creating new logic\nsystems where different aspects are integrated, starting from given\nlogics. This demand typically occurs in software engineering and\nsecurity: knowledge representation, formal specification and\nverification of algorithms and protocols have a marked need for\nworking with several logics. In a less pragmatical scenery, this would\nbe the case if one is interested, for instance, in adding a modal\ndimension to an intuitionistic or a paraconsistent logic. Moreover, it\nis interesting to characterize which properties of the factors can be\ntransferred to the combined logic. This direction is said to be a\nprocess of splicing logics.\n\nThe essential distinctions between splicing (in the direction of\nsynthesis) and splitting (in the direction of analysis) take into\naccount the intentions one may have in mind, and consequently each\ndirection encompasses specifically designed techniques.\n\nThe paradigm of splicing logics assumes a bottom-up perspective: it\ncombines given logics, synthesizing them, and producing a new one. The\ncombined logic should be minimal in some sense: that is, if \\({{\\cal\nL}}\\) is obtained from \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\) by some\ncombination process, it should be expected that: 1) \\({{\\cal L}}\\)\nextends both \\({{\\cal L}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\); and 2)\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) is a minimal extension of both \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\). For instance, some methods may require\n\\({{\\cal L}}\\) to be the least conservative extension of both \\({{\\cal\nL}}_1\\) and \\({{\\cal L}}_2\\). This point will be discussed in\n section 5.\n\nOn the other hand, splitting a logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) assumes a top-down\nperspective: logics are decomposed into (presumably simpler)\nfactors.\n\nIt should be stressed that most of the methods for combining logics\nfound in the literature are better understood from the splicing\nperspective, placing prominence on the creation of a logic system from\nfamiliar logics. However, some splicing methods such as fusion (see\n subsection 4.1)\n are more usefully regarded as a method of decomposition of logics\ninto simpler fragments, and in this way also work in the splitting\ndirection. Possible-translations semantics (see\n subsection 4.4),\n on the other hand, constitute a typical method within the splitting\nperspective.\n",
