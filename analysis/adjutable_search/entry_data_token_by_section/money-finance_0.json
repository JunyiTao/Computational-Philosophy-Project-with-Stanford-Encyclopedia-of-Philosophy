    "main_text": "Metaphysics || What is Money?\n1.1 What is Money?\n\nMoney is so ever-present in modern life that we tend to take its\nexistence and nature for granted. But do we know what money actually\nis? Two competing theories present fundamentally different ontologies\nof money.\n\nThe commodity theory of money: A classic theory,\nwhich goes back all the way to Aristotle (Politics,\n1255b\u20131256b), holds that money is a kind of commodity that\nfulfills three functions: it serves as (i) a medium of exchange, (ii)\na unit of account, and (iii) a store of value. Imagine a society that\nlacks money, and in which people have to barter goods with each other.\nBarter only works when there is a double coincidence of\nwants; that is, when A wants what B has and\nB wants what A has. But since such coincidences are\nlikely to be uncommon, a barter economy seems both cumbersome and\ninefficient (Smith 1776, Menger 1892). At some point, people will\nrealize that they can trade more easily if they use some intermediate\ngood\u2014money. This intermediate good should ideally be easy to\nhandle, store and transport (function i). It should be easy to measure\nand divide to facilitate calculations (function ii). And it should be\ndifficult to destroy so that it lasts over time (function iii).\n\nMonetary history may be viewed as a process of improvement with regard\nto these functions of money (Ferguson 2008, Weatherford 1997). For\nexample, some early societies used certain basic necessities as money,\nsuch as cattle or grain. Other societies settled on commodities that\nwere easier to handle and to tally but with more indirect value, such\nas clamshells and precious metals. The archetypical form of money\nthroughout history are gold or silver coins\u2014therefore the\ncommodity theory is sometimes called metallism (Knapp 1924,\nSchumpeter 1954). Coinage is an improvement on bullion in that both\nquantity and purity are guaranteed by some third party, typically the\ngovernment. Finally, paper money can be viewed as a simplification of\nthe trade in coins. For example, a bank note issued by the Bank of\nEngland in the 1700s was a promise to pay the bearer a certain pound\nweight of sterling silver (hence the origin of the name of the British\ncurrency as \u201cpounds sterling\u201d).\n\nThe commodity theory of money was defended by many classical\neconomists and can still be found in most economics textbooks (Mankiw\n2009, Parkin 2011). This latter fact is curious since it has provoked\nserious and sustained critique. An obvious flaw is that it has\ndifficulties in explaining inflation, the decreasing value of money\nover time (Innes 1913, Keynes 1936). It has also been challenged on\nthe grounds that it is historically inaccurate. For example, recent\nanthropological studies question the idea that early societies went\nfrom a barter economy to money; instead money seems to have arisen to\nkeep track of pre-existing credit relationships (Graeber 2011, Martin\n2013, Douglas 2016).\n\nThe credit theory of money: According to the main\nrival theory, coins and notes are merely tokens of something more\nabstract: money is a social construction rather than a physical\ncommodity. The abstract entity in question is a credit relationship;\nthat is, a promise from someone to grant (or repay) a favor (product\nor service) to the holder of the token (Macleod 1889, Innes 1914,\nIngham 2004). In order to function as money, two further features are\ncrucial: that (i) the promise is sufficiently credible, that is, the\nissuer is \u201ccreditworthy\u201d; and (ii) the credit is\ntransferable, that is, also others will accept it as payment for\ntrade.\n\nIt is commonly thought that the most creditworthy issuer of money is\nthe state. This thought provides an alternative explanation of the\npredominance of coins and notes whose value is guaranteed by states.\nBut note that this theory also can explain so-called fiat money, which\nis money that is underwritten by the state but not redeemable in any\ncommodity like gold or silver. Fiat money has been the dominant kind\nof money globally since 1971, when the United States terminated the\nconvertibility of dollars to gold. The view that only states can issue\nmoney is called chartalism, or the state theory of money\n(Knapp 1924). However, in order to properly understand the current\nmonetary system, it is important to distinguish between states\u2019\nissuing versus underwriting money. Most credit money\nin modern economies is actually issued by commercial banks through\ntheir lending operations, and the role of the state is only to\nguarantee the convertibility of bank deposits into cash (Pettifor\n2014).\n\nCriticisms of the credit theory tend to be normative and focus on the\nrisk of overexpansion of money, that is, that states (and banks) can\noveruse their \u201cprinting presses\u201d which may lead to\nunsustainable debt levels, excessive inflation, financial instability\nand economic crises. These are sometimes seen as arguments for a\nreturn to the gold standard (Rothbard 1983, Schlichter 2014). However,\nothers argue that the realization that money is socially constructed\nis the best starting point for developing a more sustainable and\nequitable monetary regime (Graeber 2010, Pettifor 2014). We will\nreturn to this political debate below\n (section 5.2).\n\nThe social ontology of money: But exactly how does\nthe \u201csocial construction\u201d of money work? This question\ninvokes the more general philosophical issue of social ontology, with\nregard to which money is often used as a prime example. In an early\nphilosophical-sociological account, Georg Simmel (1900) describes\nmoney as an institution that is a crucial precondition for modernity\nbecause it allows putting a value on things and simplifies\ntransactions; he also criticizes the way in which money thereby\nreplaces other forms of valuation (see also\n section 4.1).\n\nIn the more recent debate, one can distinguish between two main\nphilosophical camps. An influential account of social ontology holds\nthat money is the sort of social institution whose existence depends\non \u201ccollective intentionality\u201d: beliefs and attitudes that\nare shared in a community (Searle 1995, 2010). The process starts with\nsomeone\u2019s simple and unilateral declaration that something is\nmoney, which is a performative speech act. When other people recognize\nor accept the declaration it becomes a standing social rule. Thus,\nmoney is said to depend on our subjective attitudes but is not located\n(solely) in our minds (see also Lawson 2016, Brynjarsd\u00f3ttir\n2018, Passinsky 2020, Vooys & Dick 2021).\n\nAn alternative account holds that the creation of money need not be\nintentional or declarative in the above sense. Instead money comes\nabout as a solution to a social problem (the double coincidence of\nwants) \u2013 and it is maintained simply because it is functional or\nbeneficial to us (Guala 2016, Hindriks & Guala 2021). Thus what\nmakes something money is not the official declarations of some\nauthority, but rather that it works (functions) as money in a given\nsociety (see also Smit et al. 2011; 2016). (For more discussion see\nthe special issue by Hindriks & Sandberg 2020, as well as the\nentries on\n social ontology\n and\n social institutions).\n",
