Issues of Analysis and Definition\n\nMore than most policy areas dealt with by political philosophers, the\ndiscussion of property is beset with definitional difficulties. The\nfirst issue is to distinguish between property and private\nproperty.\n\nStrictly speaking, \u2018property\u2019 is a general term for the\nrules that govern people\u2019s access to and control of things like land,\nnatural resources, the means of production, manufactured goods, and\nalso (on some accounts) texts, ideas, inventions, and other\nintellectual products. Disagreements about their use are likely to be\nserious because resource-use matters to people. They are particularly\nserious where the objects in question are both scarce and necessary.\nSome have suggested that property relations only make sense under\nconditions of scarcity (Hume [1739] 1888, pp. 484\u201398). But other\ngrounds of conflict are possible: there may be disagreements about how\na given piece of land should be used, which stem from the history or\nsymbolic significance of that piece of land, whether land in\ngeneral is scarce or not. (Intellectual property provides an example\nof property rules that do not respond directly to scarcity; moreover\nunlike material objects, the objects of intellectual property are not\ncrowdable, for their use by any one person does not preclude their use\nby any number of\n others.)[1]\n\nAny society with an interest in avoiding conflict needs such a system\nof rules. Their importance can hardly be overestimated, for without\nthem cooperation, production, and exchange are virtually impossible,\nor possible only in the fearful and truncated forms we see in\n\u2018black markets.\u2019 This necessity is sometimes cited as an\nargument in favor of private property (Benn and Peters 1959,\np. 155). In fact, all it establishes is that there ought to be\nproperty rules of some kind: private property rules are one\nvariety. Some human societies have existed for millennia, satisfying\nthe needs and wants of all their members, without private property or\nanything like it in land or the other major resources of economic\nlife. So the first step in sound argumentation about property is\ndistinguishing those arguments which support the existence of property\nin general from arguments which support the existence of a system of a\nspecific kind (Waldron 1988).\n\nThere are three species of property arrangement: common property,\ncollective property, and private property. In a common\nproperty system, resources are governed by rules whose point is\nto make them available for use by all or any members of the society. A\ntract of common land, for example, may be used by everyone in a\ncommunity for grazing cattle or gathering food. A park may be open to\nall for picnics, sports or recreation. The aim of any restrictions on\nuse is simply to secure fair access for all and to prevent anyone from\nusing the common resource in a way that would preclude its use by\nothers. Collective property is a different idea: here the\ncommunity as a whole determines how important resources are to be\nused. These determinations are made on the basis of the social\ninterest through mechanisms of collective\ndecision-making\u2014anything from a leisurely debate among the\nelders of a tribe to the forming and implementing of a Soviet-style\n\u2018Five-Year Plan\u2019.\n\nPrivate property is an alternative to both collective and\ncommon property. In a private property system, property rules are\norganized around the idea that various contested resources are\nassigned to the decisional authority of particular individuals (or\nfamilies or firms). Thomas Merrill (2012) calls this \u2018the\nproperty strategy\u2019 and contrasts it with bureaucratic governance\nor the management of resources through group consensus. In a system of\nprivate property, the person to whom a given object is assigned\n(e.g., the person who found it or made it) has control over the\nobject: it is for her to decide what should be done with it. In\nexercising this authority, she is not understood to be acting as an\nagent or official of the society. She may act on her own initiative\nwithout giving anyone else an explanation, or she may enter into\ncooperative arrangements with others, just as she likes. She may even\ntransfer this right of decision to someone else, in which case that\nperson acquires the same rights she had. In general the right of a\nproprietor to decide as she pleases about the resource that she owns\napplies whether or not others are affected by her decision. If\nJennifer owns a steel factory, it is for her to decide (in\nher own interest) whether to close it or to keep the plant operating,\neven though a decision to close may have the gravest impact on her\nemployees and on the prosperity of the local community.\n\nThough private property is a system of individual decision-making, it\nis still a system of social rules. The owner is not required to rely\non her own strength to vindicate her right to make self-interested\ndecisions about the object assigned to her: if Jennifer\u2019s employees\noccupy the steel factory to keep it operating despite her wishes, she\ncan call the police and have them evicted; she does not have to do\nthis herself or even pay for it herself. So private property is\ncontinually in need of public justification\u2014first, because it\nempowers individuals to make decisions about the use of scarce\nresource in a way that is not necessarily sensitive to others\u2019 needs\nor the public good; and second, because it does not merely permit that\nbut deploys public force at public expense to uphold it.\n\nIt may be thought that the justificatory issue is nowadays moot, with\nthe collapse of socialist systems in Eastern Europe and the former\nSoviet Union, and the triumph of market economies all over the world.\nIt is tempting to conclude that since economic collectivism has been\nthoroughly discredited, the problem of justifying private\nproperty has been solved by default: there is simply no alternative.\nBut the point of discussing the justification of an institution is not\nonly to defend it against its competitors. Often we justify in order to\nunderstand and also to operate the institution intelligently. In\nthinking about property, there are a number of issues that make little\nsense unless debated with an awareness of what the point of\nprivate property might be. Some of these issues are\ntechnical. Consider, for example, the rule against perpetuities, the\nregistration of land titles, or the limits on testamentary freedom;\nall these would be like an arcane and unintelligible code, to be\nlearned at best by rote, unless we connect them with the point of\nthrowing social authority behind individual control (or behind the\nindividual disposition of control) over material resources. (See\nAckerman 1977, p. 116.)\n\nThe same is true of some grander issues. The Fifth Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution requires that private property not be taken for\npublic use without compensation. Clearly this prohibits the simple\nseizure of someone\u2019s land for use, say, as a firing range or an\nairport. But what if the state places a restriction on the use of a\nperson\u2019s land, telling the owner that she may not erect a modern\nskyscraper because it will compromise the historical aesthetics of the\nneighborhood? Does this amount to a taking? Certainly the owner has\nsuffered a loss (she may have bought the land with the intention of\ndeveloping it). On the other hand, we should not pretend that there is\na taking whenever any restriction is imposed: I may not drive my car\nat 100 m.p.h. but I am still the owner of the car. Such questions\ncannot be answered intelligently without revisiting the reasons (if\nany) that there are for giving private property this sort of\nconstitutional protection. Is it protected because we distrust the\nstate\u2019s ability to make intelligent decisions about resource use? Or\nis it protected because we want to place limits on the burdens that\nany individual may be expected to bear for the sake of the public\ngood? Our sense of the ultimate values that private ownership is\nsupposed to serve may make a considerable difference to our\ninterpretation of the takings clause and other doctrines.\n\nPlainly private property and collective control are not all-or-nothing\nalternatives. In every modern society, some resources are governed by\ncommon property rules (e.g., streets and parks), some are governed by\ncollective property rules (e.g., military bases and artillery pieces),\nand some are governed by private property rules (toothbrushes and\nbicycles). Also, there are variations in the degree of freedom that a\nprivate owner has over the resources assigned to him. Obviously, an\nowner\u2019s freedom is limited by background rules of conduct: I may not\nuse my gun to kill another person. These are not strictly property\nrules. More to the point are things like zoning restrictions, which\namount in effect to the imposition of a collective decision about\ncertain aspects of the use of a given resource. The owner of a\nbuilding in an historic district may be told, for example, that she\ncan use it as a shop, a home, or a hotel but she may not knock it down\nand replace it with a skyscraper. In this case, we may still say that\nthe historic building counts as private property; but if too many\nother areas of decision about its use were also controlled by public\nagencies, we would be more inclined to say that it was really subject\nto a collective property rule (with the \u2018owner\u2019\nfunctioning as steward of society\u2019s decisions).\n\nIt is probably a mistake therefore to insist on any definition of\nprivate property that implies a proprietor has absolute control over\nhis\n resource.[2]\n Some jurists have even argued that the terms \u2018property\u2019\nand \u2018ownership\u2019 should be eliminated from the technical\ndiscourse of the law (see Grey 1980). They say that calling someone\nthe \u2018owner\u2019 of a resource conveys no exact information\nabout her rights in relation to that resource: a corporate owner is\nnot the same as an individual owner; the owner of intellectual\nproperty has a different array of rights than the owner of an\nautomobile; and even with regard to one and the same resource, the\nrights (and duties) of a landlord who owes nothing on his property\nmight be quite different from those of a mortgagor.\n\nThe eliminative proposal makes sense to this extent: the position of a\nprivate owner is best understood not as a single right to the\nexclusive use and control of the object in question, but as a bundle\nof rights, which may vary from case to case (Honore 1961).\n\nIn recent literature, the \u2018bundle of rights\u2019 conception\nhas encountered resistance. Some theorists want to insist that\nproperty is better conceived, as it is in colloquial usage, as a\nsubstantial relation between a person and a thing (Penner 2000 and\nSmith 2012). This can be put forward on analytic grounds or for\nideological reasons; on the latter approach it is said that the\nimportance of property for a free society is obscured when the\nownership relation is treated as a divisible bundle of rights (Attas\n2006).\n\nTheorists who persevere with the \u2018bundle of rights\u2019\nanalysis nevertheless present some sticks in the bundle as more\nimportant than others: the right to exclude is usually seen as the key\nto ownership, even if it is one among many other rights and legal\nrelations that property comprises. It is the aspect of ownership that\nhas the greatest impact on others (Waldron 1993). Other\ntheorists are more skeptical about this. Katz 2008 and Dagan 2011\nsuggest that in our analysis of private property we should place less\nemphasis on the right to exclude and more on the owner\u2019s power\nof agenda-setting so far as the use of a given resource is concerned.\nOn any account, \u2018exclusive use\u2019 is a complex idea. Its\nimplications vary from context to context and from object to object:\nwe actually have a plurality of property arrangements, striking\ndifferent balances between owners\u2019 and others\u2019 interests\n(Dagan 2013). In its most abstract terms, the right to exclude\nimplies, first, that the owner is at liberty to use the object as he\npleases (within a range of generally acceptable uses) without\ninterference from others. Secondly, it implies that others have\nan obligation to refrain from using the object without the owner\u2019s\npermission. The point about permission implies in turn that the owner\nhas the power to license others to use her property. She may lend her\nautomobile, rent her house, or grant a right of way over her land. The\neffect of this may be to create other property interests in the\nobject, so that the various liberties, rights and powers of ownership\nare divided among several individuals.\n\nMore strikingly, the owner is legally empowered to transfer the whole\nbundle of rights in the object she owns to somebody else\u2014as a\ngift or by sale or as a legacy after death. With this power, a private\nproperty system becomes self-perpetuating. After an initial assignment\nof objects to owners, there is no further need for the community or\nthe state to concern itself with distributive questions. Objects will\ncirculate as the whims and decisions of individual owners and their\nsuccessive transferees dictate. The result may be that wealth is\nwidely distributed or it may be that wealth is concentrated in a very\nfew hands. It is part of the logic of private property that no-one has\nthe responsibility to concern themselves with the big picture, so far\nas the distribution of resources is concerned. Society simply pledges\nitself to enforce the rights of exclusion that ownership involves\nwherever those rights happen to be. Any concern about the balance\nbetween rich and poor must be brought in as a separate matter of\npublic policy (as tax and welfare policy or in extremis large\nscale redistribution). As we shall see, philosophers disagree as to\nwhether this is an advantage or an indictment of private property\nsystems.\n\nAt the furthest reaches of analysis, the concept of private property\nbecomes quite contestable. Many people believe that ownership implies\ninheritance. But Mill once observed (Mill 1994 [1848], p. 28) that the\nprivate property idea implied only \u2018the right of each to his (or\nher) own faculties, to what he can produce by them, and to whatever he\ncan get for them in a fair market; together with his right to give\nthis to any other person if he chooses.\u2019 He said that passing\nthe property of individuals who made no disposition of it during their\nlifetime to their children \u2018may be a proper arrangement or not,\nbut it is no consequence of the principle of private property\u2019\n(ibid.). Definitive resolution of such controversies is probably\nimpossible. Some philosophers have suggested that certain concepts\nshould be regarded as \u2018essentially contested concepts\u2019\n(see Gallie 1956); if there is anything to this suggestion, private\nproperty might be one of them (see Waldron 1988, pp. 51\u20132).\n2. Historical Overview\n\nThere are extensive discussions of property in the writings of Plato,\nAristotle, Aquinas, Hegel, Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Kant, Marx, and Mill.\nThe range of justificatory themes they consider is very broad, and I\nshall begin with a summary.\n\nThe ancient authors speculated about the relation between property and\nvirtue, a natural subject for discussion since justifying private\nproperty raises serious questions about the legitimacy of\nself-interested activity. Plato (Republic, 462b-c) argued\nthat collective ownership was necessary to promote common pursuit of\nthe common interest, and to avoid the social divisiveness that would\noccur \u2018when some grieve exceedingly and others rejoice at the\nsame happenings.\u2019 Aristotle responded by arguing that private\nownership promotes virtues like prudence and responsibility:\n\u2018[W]hen everyone has a distinct interest, men will not complain\nof one another, and they will make more progress, because every one\nwill be attending to his own business\u2019 (Aristotle,\nPolitics, 1263a). Even altruism, said Aristotle, might be\nbetter promoted by focusing ethical attention on the way a person\nexercises his rights of private property rather than\nquestioning the institution itself (ibid.). Aristotle also reflected\non the relation between property and freedom, and the contribution\nthat ownership makes to a person\u2019s being a free man and thus suitable\nfor citizenship. The Greeks took liberty to be a status defined by\ncontrast with slavery, and for Aristotle, to be free was to belong to\noneself, to be one\u2019s own man, whereas the slave was by nature the\nproperty of another. Self-possession was connected with having\nsufficient distance from one\u2019s desires to enable the practice of\nvirtuous self-control. On this account, the natural slave was unfree\nbecause his reason could not prescribe a rule to his bodily appetites.\nAristotle had no hesitation in extending this point beyond slavery to\nthe conditions of \u2018the meaner sort of workman.\u2019 Obsessed\nwith need, the poor are \u2018too degraded\u2019 to participate in\npolitics like free men. \u2018You could no more make a city out of\npaupers,\u2019 wrote Aristotle, \u2018than out of slaves\u2019\n(ibid., 1278a). They must be ruled like slaves, for otherwise their\npressing and immediate needs will issue in envy and violence. Some of\nthese themes have emerged more recently in civic republican theories,\nthough modern theories of citizenship tend to begin with a sense of\nwho should be citizens (all adult residents) and then proceed to argue\nthat they should all have property, rather than using existing wealth\nas an independent criterion for the franchise (King and Waldron\n1988).\n\nIn the medieval period, Thomas Aquinas continued discussion of the\nAristotlean idea that virtue might be expressed in the use that one\nmakes of one\u2019s property. But Aquinas gave it a sharper edge. Not only\ndo the rich have moral obligations to act generously, but the poor\nalso have rights against the rich. Beginning from the premise that\n\u2018[a]ccording to the natural order established by Divine\nProvidence, inferior things are ordained for the purpose of succoring\nman\u2019s needs\u2026\u2019 (Aquinas ST, p. 72), Aquinas\nargued that no division of resources based on human law can prevail\nover the necessities associated with destitution. This is a theme\nwhich recurs throughout our tradition\u2014most notably in Locke\u2019s\nFirst Treatise on Government, (Locke 1988 [1689], I, para.\n42)\u2014as an essential qualification of whatever else is said about\nthe legitimacy of private property (Horne 1990).\n\nIn the early modern period, philosophers turned their attention to the\nway in which property might have been instituted, with Hobbes and Hume\narguing that there is no natural \u2018mine\u2019 or\n\u2018thine,\u2019 and that property must be understood as the\ncreation of the sovereign state (Hobbes 1983 [1647]) or at the very\nleast the artificial product of a convention \u2018enter\u2019d into by\nall the members of the society to bestow stability on the possession\nof\u2026external goods, and leave every one in the peaceable\nenjoyment of what he may acquire by his fortune and industry\u2019\n(Hume 1978 [1739], p. 489). John Locke (1988 [1689]), on the other\nhand, was adamant that property could have been instituted in a state\nof nature without any special conventions or political decisions.\n\nLocke\u2019s theory is widely regarded as the most interesting of the\ncanonical discussions of property. In part this is a result of how he\nbegan his account; because he took as his starting point that God gave\nthe world to men in common, he had to acknowledge from the outset that\nprivate entitlements pose a moral problem. How do we move from a\ncommon endowment to the \u2018disproportionate and unequal Possession\nof the Earth\u2019 that seems to go along with private property?\nUnlike some of his predecessors, Locke did not base his resolution of\nthis difficulty on any theory of universal (even tacit) consent.\nInstead, in the most famous passage of his chapter on property, he\ngave a moral defense of the legitimacy of unilateral\nappropriation.\n\nThough the Earth\u2026be common to all Men, yet every Man has a\nProperty in his own Person. This no Body has any Right to but himself.\nThe Labour of his Body, and the Work of his Hands, we may say, are\nproperly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the State that Nature\nhath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his Labour with, and\njoyned to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his\nProperty. It being by him removed from the common state Nature placed\nit in, it hath by this labour something annexed to it, that excludes\nthe common right of other Men. (Locke 1988 [1689], II, para. 27)\n\n\nThe interest of Locke\u2019s account lies in the way he combines the\nstructure of a theory of first occupancy with an account of the\nsubstantive moral significance of labor. In the hands of writers like\nSamuel Pufendorf (1991 [1673], p. 84), First Occupancy theory\nproceeded on the basis that the first human user of a natural\nresource\u2014a piece of land, for example\u2014is distinguished\nfrom all others in that he did not have to displace anyone else in\norder to take possession. It did not particularly matter how\nhe took possession of it, or what sort of use he made of it: what\nmattered was that he began acting as its owner without dispossessing\nanyone else. Now although Locke used the logic of this account, it\ndid matter for him that the land was cultivated or in some\nother way used productively. (For this reason, he expressed doubts\nwhether indigenous hunters or nomadic peoples could properly be\nregarded as owners of the land over which they roamed.) This is partly\nbecause Locke identified the ownership of labor as something connected\nsubstantially to the primal ownership of self. But it was also because\nhe thought the productivity of labor would help answer some of the\ndifficulties which he saw in First Occupancy theory. Though the first\noccupier does not actually dispossess anyone, still his acquisition\nmay prejudice other\u2019s interests if there is not, in Locke\u2019s words,\n\u2018enough and as good left in common\u2019 for them to enjoy\n(Locke 1988 [1689], II, para. 27). Locke\u2019s answer to this difficulty\nwas to emphasize that appropriation by productive labor\nactually increased the amount of goods available in society for others\n(ibid., II, para. 37). There is also something like a strand of moral\ndesert in Locke\u2019s theory: if one person fails to take advantage\nof an opportunity of resource-use or resource development, can that\nperson really complain or demand compensation when the opportunity is\ntaken up by someone else (de Jasay 2004)?\n\nImmanuel Kant\u2019s work on property is more formal and abstract than\nLocke\u2019s and\u2014at least until recently-it was less\nwell-known. (But now see Byrd and Hruschka 2006 and Ripstein 2009.)\nKant began by emphasizing a general connection between property and\nagency, maintaining that there would be an affront to agency and thus\nto human personality, if some system were not arrived at which could\npermit useful objects to be used. He inferred from this that \u2018it\nis a duty of right to act towards others so that what is external\n(usable) could also become someone\u2019s\u2019 (Kant 1991 [1797], p. 74)\nThough this legitimated unilateral appropriation, it did so only in a\nprovisional way. Since the appropriation of a resource as private\nproperty affects everyone else\u2019s position (imposing duties on them\nthat they would otherwise not have), it cannot acquire full legitimacy\nby unilateral action: it must be ratified by an arrangement which\nrespects everyone\u2019s interests in this matter. So the force of the\nprinciple requiring people to act so that external objects can be used\nas property also requires them to enter into a civil constitution,\nwhich will actually settle who is to be the owner of what on a basis\nthat is fair to all.\n\nG.W.F. Hegel\u2019s account of property centers on the contribution\nproperty makes to the development of the self, \u2018superseding and\nreplacing the subjective phase of personality\u2019 (1967 [1821],\npara. 41a) and giving some sort of external reality to what would\notherwise be the mere idea of individual freedom. These rather obscure\nformulations were taken up also by the English idealists, most notably\nby T.H. Green (1941 [1895]), who emphasized the contribution that\nownership makes to ethical development, to the growth of the will and\na sense of responsibility. But neither of these writers thought of the\ndevelopment of the individual person as the be-all and end-all of\nproperty. In both cases it was thought of as a stage in the growth of\nsocial responsibility. Both saw the freedom embodied in property as\nultimately positive freedom\u2014freedom to choose\nrationally and responsibly for the wider social good. In Karl Marx\u2019s\nphilosophy, Hegel\u2019s sense of there being several stages in the growth\nof positive freedom is framed in terms of stages of social development\nrather than stages of the growth of individuals (Marx 1972 [1862]).\nAnd for Marx, as for Plato, social responsibility in the exercise of\nprivate property rights is never enough. The whole trajectory of the\ndevelopment of modern society, says Marx, is towards large-scale\ncooperative labor. This may be masked by forms of property that treat\nvast corporations as private owners, but eventually this carapace will\nbe abandoned and collectivist economic relations will emerge and be\ncelebrated as such.\n\nThe general merits of private property versus socialism thus became a\nsubject of genuine debate in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\nJohn Stuart Mill, with his characteristic open-mindedness treated\ncommunism as a genuine option, and he confronted objections to the\ncollectivist ideal with the suggestion that the inequitable\ndistribution of property in actually existing capitalist societies\nalready partakes of many of these difficulties. He insisted however,\nthat private property be given a fair hearing as well:\n\nIf\u2026the choice were to be made between Communism\u2026and the\npresent state of society with all its sufferings and\ninjustices,\u2026all the difficulties, great or small, of Communism\nwould be but as dust in the balance. But to make the comparison\napplicable, we must compare Communism at its best, with the regime of\nindividual property, not as it is, but as it might be made\u2026The\nlaws of property have never yet conformed to the principles on which\nthe justification of private property rests. (Mill 1994[1848], pp.\n14\u201315)\n\n\nMill is surely right, at least so far as the aims of a philosophical\ndiscussion of property are concerned. Indeed, one way of looking at\nthe history we have just briefly surveyed is that it is the history of\nsuccessive attempts to tease out, from the mess of actually-existing\nmaldistribution and exploitation, some sense of the true principles on\nwhich the justification of an ideal system of private property would\nrest, and a sense too of other aspects of moral enterprise which such\nan institution might serve.\n3. Is Property a Philosophical Issue?\n\nWhat is it about property that engages the interest of philosophers?\nWhy should philosophers be interested in property?\n\nSome have suggested that they need not be. John Rawls argued that\nquestions about the system of ownership are secondary or derivative\nquestions, to be dealt with pragmatically rather than as issues in\npolitical philosophy (Rawls 1999, pp. 235\u201342). Although every society\nhas to decide whether the economy will be organized on the basis of\nmarkets and private ownership or on the basis of central collective\ncontrol, there was little that philosophers could contribute to these\ndebates. Philosophers, Rawls said, are better off discussing the\nabstract principles of justice that should constrain the establishment\nof any social institutions, than trying to settle a\npriori questions of social and economic strategy. His own\nsuggestions favoring the institutions of \u2018a property-owning\ndemocracy\u2019 are put forward more as intermediate principles than\nas fundamentals of justice.\n\nOn the other hand, with the growing attention that is being paid in\nthe discipline to public policy generally, it is difficult to deny\nthat questions about property can be posed in terms that are abstract\nenough for philosophers to address. Though Rawls counsels us to talk\nabout justice rather than property, in fact issues about property are\ninevitably implicated in some of the issues about justice that have\npreoccupied political philosophers in recent years. Certain property\ninstitutions may be better than others for justice. A system of\nmarkets and private property covering all or most of the resources in\nsociety will make it very difficult to ensure the steady application\nof principles like equality, distribution according to need, or even\nas some have argued\u2014see e.g., Hayek 1976\u2014distribution\naccording to desert. Some have argued that property rights in a market\neconomy ought to be treated as resistant to redistribution and perhaps\nas insensitive to distributive justice generally except possibly at\nthe moment of their initial allocation (see Nozick, 1974). If we take\nthis view and if we also take distributive issues seriously, we may\nhave to commit ourselves to a compromised or eclectic system rather\nthan a pure market system of private property.\n\nWhat about the ownership relation itself? Is there any inherent\nphilosophical interest in the nature of a person\u2019s relation to\nmaterial resources? When someone says \u2018X is mine\u2019\nand X is an action, we see interesting questions about\nintentionality, free-will, and responsibility, which philosophers will\nwant to pursue. Or when someone says \u2018X belongs to\nperson P,\u2019 and X is an event, memory, or\nexperience, there are interesting questions about personal identity.\nBut when X is an apple or a piece of land or an automobile,\nthere does not appear to be any question of an inherent\nrelation between X and P which might arouse our\ninterest.\n\nThis was one of David Hume\u2019s conclusions. There is nothing natural\nabout private property, wrote Hume. The \u2018contrariety\u2019 of\nour passions and the \u2018looseness and easy transition [of material\nobjects] from one person to another\u2019 mean that any situation in\nwhich I hold or use a resource is always vulnerable to disruption\n(Hume 1978 [1739], p. 488). Until possession is stabilized by social\nrules, there is no secure relation between person and thing. We may\nthink that there ought to be: we may think, for example, that a person\nhas a moral right to something that he has made and that society has\nan obligation to give legal backing to this moral right. But according\nto Hume, we have to ask what it is in general for society to set up\nand enforce rules of this kind, before we can reach any conclusions\nabout the normative significance of the relation between any\nparticular person and any particular thing.\n\nOur property is nothing but those goods, whose constant possession is\nestablish\u2019d by the laws of society; that is, by the laws of justice.\nThose, therefore, who make use of the words property, or right, or\nobligation, before they have explain\u2019d the origin of justice, or even\nmake use of them in that explication, are guilty of a very gross\nfallacy, and can never reason upon any solid foundation. A man\u2019s\nproperty is some object related to him. This relation is not natural,\nbut moral, and founded on justice. Tis very preposterous, therefore,\nto imagine, that we can have any idea of property, without fully\ncomprehending the nature of justice, and shewing its origin in the\nartifice and contrivance of man. The origin of justice explains that\nof property. The same artifice gives rise to both. (ibid., p. 491)\n\n\nThe Humean view of property as a convention has been taken up by\nMurphy and Nagel (2004) as a basis for resisting the view, associated\nwith Nozick 1974, that property rights can pose any moral obstacle to\nprograms of tax and transfer or other forms of redistribution and\nsocial control. But the fact that something is conventional\ndoesn\u2019t mean it can safely be treated as malleable or as\nsomething that can be overridden without cost. There is always a\nfurther question about the moral reasons that there are for holding\nconventions steady; and these reasons may actually echo other themes\nin the property debate.\n\nBefore Hume, the view that the issue of property begged questions\nabout the general basis of social organization was already\nforeshadowed in the political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes. Indeed\nHobbes regarded property as the key to political philosophy:\n\u2018[M]y first enquiry was to be from whence it proceeded, that any\nman should call any thing rather his Owne, th[a]n another\nmans\u2019 (Hobbes 1983 [1647], pp. 26\u20137). For Hobbes, property\nrules were the product of authority\u2014the acknowledged authority\nof a sovereign, whose commands could guarantee the peace and make it\nsafe for men to embark on social and economic activities that\noutstripped their ability to protect themselves using their own\nindividual strength. Hume, by contrast, was interested in the\npossibility that the relevant settlement might emerge as conventions\nfrom ordinary human interactions rather than as impositions by an\nacknowledged figure in authority (Hume 1978 [1739], p.\n490).[3]\n\nStill even if we concede that property is the product of social rules,\nand that normative thinking about the former must be preceded by\nnormative thinking about the latter, there might be facts about the\nhuman condition or our agency as embodied beings that provide\nphilosophical premises for an argument that property relations should\nbe established in one way rather than another. Clearly, there is at\nleast one material object with which a person does seem to have an\nintimate pre-legal relation that would bear some philosophical\nanalysis\u2014namely, that person\u2019s body. We are embodied beings and\nto a certain extent the use and control of our limbs, sensory organs\netc. is indispensable for our agency. Were a person to be deprived of\nthis control\u2014were others to have the right to block or\nmanipulate the movements of his physical body\u2014then his agency\nwould be truncated, and he would be incapable of using his powers of\nintention and action to make something he (and others) could regard as\na life for himself. Some modern authors, following John Locke, have\ntried to think about this in terms of an idea of self-ownership.\nAccording to G.A. Cohen (1995) a person owns himself when he has all\nthe control over his own body that a master would have over him were\nhe a slave. Now since a master is entitled to make comprehensive use\nof his slave for his own profit without owing any account or any\ncontribution to anyone else, it seems to follow from the idea of\nself-ownership that a person must be allowed to profit equally\ncomprehensively from the control of his own mental and bodily\nresources. Taking his cue from Nozick (1974) that taxation on earnings\nis a form of coerced labor (for others or for the state), Cohen\nconcludes that various egalitarian arrangements (like welfare paid for\nout of taxation) are incompatible with the self-ownership of the rich.\nIt looks like we have to choose between principles of equality and\nprinciples of self-ownership. Debate on this issue continues (Otsuka\n1998, Vrousalis 2011, and Sobel 2012): some argue that what we owe to\nothers must be figured out first before there can be any question of\nowning either our selves, our bodies, or other material resources;\nwhile others say that any attempt to make the argument in that order\nwill lead to counter-intuitive results (Nozick 1974, p. 234). Some\nrecent discussions have called into question the very idea of\nself-ownership (Rasmussen 2008 and Phillips 2013), denying that this\nconcept is necessary in order to capture the inviolability of the\nhuman person.\n\nThere is a further question whether self-ownership affords a basis for\nthinking about property in external objects other than my body? John\nLocke thought that it did (Locke 1988 [1689], II, para. 27). He\nsuggested that when I work on an object or cultivate a piece of land,\nI project something of my self-owned self into the thing. That\nsomething I have worked on embodies a part of me is a common enough\nsentiment, but it is difficult to give it a analytically precise\nsense. That an object is shaped the way it is may be an effect of my\nactions; but actions don\u2019t seem to have the trans-temporal endurance\nto enable us to say that they remain present in the object\nafter the time of their performance. The idea of mixing one\u2019s labor\nseems to be a piece of rhetoric which enhances other arguments for\nprivate property rather than an argument in its own right.\n\nOthers have speculated about an effect in the opposite\ndirection\u2014not so much the incorporation of the self into the\nobject as the incorporation of the thing into the self (Radin 1982).\nThis was a theme in Hegel\u2019s work, where there was a suggestion that\nowning property helped the individual to \u2018supersede the mere\nsubjectivity of personality\u2019 (Hegel [1821] 1991, 73); in plain\nEnglish, it gave them the opportunity to make concrete the plans and\nschemes that would otherwise just buzz around inside their heads, and\nto take responsibility for their intentions as the material they were\nworking on\u2014a home or an sculptor\u2019s block of\nmarble\u2014registered the impact of the decisions they had made (see\nWaldron 1988, pp. 343\u201389). Even the utilitarian Jeremy Bentham\ntoyed with a version this idea. Though property, he said, depended on\npositive law, the law of property had an effect on the self that makes\nredistribution particularly objectionable. Law provided security for\nour expectations, and when that security came to be focused on a\nparticular object, that object formed part of the structure of one\u2019s\nagency: \u2018It is hence that we have the power of forming a general\nplan of conduct; it is hence that the successive instants which\ncompose the duration of life are not like isolated and independent\npoints, but become continuous parts of a whole\u2019 (Bentham 1931\n[1802], p. 111).\n4. Genealogies of Property\n\nIn our philosophical tradition, arguments about the justification of\nproperty have often been presented as genealogies: as stories about\nthe way in which private property might have emerged in a world that\nwas hitherto unacquainted with the institution.\n\nThe best known are Lockean stories (Locke 1988 [1689] and Nozick\n1974). One begins with a description of a state of nature and an\ninitial premise about land belonging to nobody in particular. And then\none tells a story about why it would be sensible for individuals to\nappropriate land and other resources for their personal use and about\nthe conditions under which such appropriations would be justified.\nIndividuals have needs and they find themselves surrounded with\nobjects capable of satisfying those needs. But each person,\nX, is vaguely aware that the objects have not been furnished\nby God or nature for X\u2019s use alone; others have a need for\nthem as well. So what is X to do? One thing is clear: if\nX has to wait for some general meeting of everyone who might\nbe affected by his use of the resources in his vicinity before he is\nallowed to use them then, as Locke put it, \u2018man had starved,\nnotwithstanding the plenty God had given him\u2019 (Locke 1988\n[1689], II, para. 28). So the individual goes ahead and takes what he\nneeds (ibid., I, para. 86). He \u2018mixes his labor\u2019 with the\nobject he needs, and by doing so he fulfills his fundamental duty of\nself-preservation, while also increasing the value of the resources he\nworks on for the indirect benefit of others. The first phase of\nLocke\u2019s story involves individuals satisfying their needs out of the\ncommon largesse in this virtuous and self-reliant way. The second\nphase of the story involves their exchanging surplus goods that they\nhave appropriated with one another; rather than saying that such\nsurpluses lapse back into the common heritage, Locke allows\nindividuals to acquire, grow, or make more than they can use so that\nmarkets become possible and prosperity general (ibid., II, paras.\n46\u201351). With markets and prosperity, however, comes inequality,\navarice and envy, and the third and last stage of Locke\u2019s account is\nthe institution of government to protect the property rights that have\ngrown up in this way (ibid., II, paras. 123 ff.) The story assumes\nthat individuals are able to reason through these issues of who is\nentitled to appropriate and use and exchange goods without the\ntutelage of government, and that at neither the first stage nor the\nsecond stage is any social or political decision-making about property\nrequired.\n\nIn its most basic aspect, Locke\u2019s genealogy has the character of a\nFirst Occupancy story. In the first instance, the legitimacy of an\nindividual\u2019s appropriation stems largely from the fact that it does\nnot involve the direct expropriation of anyone else: by definition the\n\u2018first occupancy\u2019 is peaceful. There are, of course,\nstrong elements of utilitarian and virtue theory in Locke\u2019s account\ntoo\u2014the productivity of labor and the privileging of what Locke\ncalls \u2018the Industrious and the Rational\u2019 over the\n\u2018Covetousness of the Quarrelsom and Contentious\u2019 (ibid.,\nII, para. 34). But the issue of historical priority is indispensable.\nWhose use of a given resource came first is crucial, and the order in\nwhich goods were subsequently transferred from hand to hand is\nindispensable for understanding the legitimacy of current\nentitlements. Robert Nozick (1974) has done more than anyone else to\nelucidate the form of this kind of \u2018historical\nentitlement\u2019 theory.\n\nNot all genealogies of property have this shape. David Hume tells a\ncompletely different sort of story. On his approach, we begin by\nassuming that since time immemorial, people have been fighting over\nresources, so that the distribution of de facto possession at\nany given time is arbitrary, being driven by force, cunning, and luck.\nNow it is possible that such fighting will continue indefinitely. But\nit is also possible that it may settle down into a sort of stable\nequilibrium in which those in possession of significant resources and\nthose tempted to grab resources from others find that the marginal\ncosts of further predatory activity are equal to their marginal gains.\nUnder these conditions, something like a \u2018peace dividend\u2019\nmay be available. Maybe everyone can gain, in terms of the diminution\nof conflict, the stabilizing of social relations, and the prospects\nfor market exchange, by an agreement not to fight any more over\npossessions.\n\nI observe, that it will be for my interest to leave another in the\npossession of his goods, provided he will act in the same manner with\nregard to me. He is sensible of a like interest in the regulation of\nhis conduct. When this common sense of interest is mutually express\u2019d,\nand is known to both, it produces a suitable resolution and\nbehaviour\u2026 (Hume 1978 [1739], p. 490).\n\n\nSuch a resolution, if it lasts, may amount over time to a ratification\nof de facto holdings as de jure property. As with\nLocke\u2019s account, the state comes into the picture much later to\nreinforce conventions of property that emerge informally in this way\n(ibid., pp. 534 ff.). But notice how much more modest Hume\u2019s story is\nthan the Lockean account in the moral claims that it makes (see\nWaldron 1994). The stability of the emergent distribution has nothing\nto do with its justice, nor with the moral quality of the actions by\nwhich goods were appropriated. It may be fair or unfair, equal or\nunequal, but the parties already know that they cannot hope for a much\nbetter distribution by pitching their own strength yet again against\nthat of others. (See also Buchanan 1975 for a modern version of this\napproach.)\n\nAs an account of the genesis of property, Hume\u2019s theory has the\nadvantage over its main rivals of acknowledging that the early eras of\nhuman history are eras of conflict largely unregulated by principle\nand opaque to later moral enquiry. It does not require us to delve\ninto history to ascertain who did what to whom, and what would have\nhappened if they had not. Once a settled pattern of possession\nemerges, we simply draw an arbitrary line and say, \u2018Property\nentitlements start from here.\u2019 The model has important\nnormative consequences for the present as well. Those who are tempted\nto question or disrupt an existing distribution of property must\nrecognize that far from ushering in a new era of justice, their best\nefforts are likely to inaugurate an era of conflict in which all bets\nare off and in which virtually no planning or cooperation is possible.\nThe weakness of the Humean approach is the obverse of its strength.\nThe moral considerations that it marginalizes actually do matter to\nus. For example, we would not be happy with a Humean convention\nratifying slavery or cannibalism, but for all that Hume shows it may\nwell be a feature of the equilibrium emerging from the age of conflict\nthat some people are in possession of others\u2019 bodies. The point is\nthat even if Hume is right that the sentiment of justice is built up\nout of a convention to respect one another\u2019s de facto\npossessions, that sentiment once established can take on a life of its\nown, so that it can subsequently be turned against the very\nequilibrium that engendered it (Waldron 1994).\n\nA third variety of property-story makes the state and the social\ncontract more fundamental than it is in either Locke\u2019s or Hume\u2019s\napproach. We are to imagine a period where people try and rely on\ntheir own physical and moral initiative to take possession of the\nresources which they need or want, but in which it become increasingly\napparent that institution of reliable property arrangements is going\nto have to involve a social decision. Eventually property must be\nbased on consent\u2014the consent of everyone affected by decisions\nabout the use and control of a given set of resources. This theory is\nassociated with the normative political philosophy of Jean-Jacques\nRousseau (1968 [1762]) and Immanuel Kant (1991 [1797]). As we have\nseen, the Lockean critique of this sort of approach was always that\nurgency of material need left no time for social consent. In fact the\nRousseau/Kant approach has little difficulty with this point. There\ncan be provisional appropriations made unilaterally (Ryan 1984, p.\n80). But every such appropriation is subject in principle to the\nconsent of all and must be offered up for social ratification. In\nother words, the urgency of immediate need is not taken as a basis of\ndiscrediting the review and redistribution of possession by society as\na whole if serious distributive anomalies are emerging.\n\nWhat all this actually yields in the way of a legitimate assignment of\nresources to individuals is a matter of the distributive principles\nthat survive the test of ratification by the general will. Rawlsian,\negalitarian and utilitarian approaches are all imaginable under the\nauspices of this account. The essence of the Rousseau/Kant approach is\nthat society\u2019s deployment of principles like these to evaluate\nexisting distributions is never trumped by the history of entitlements\nand it is never excluded by the Humean conventions that may have\nemerged as a cosy equilibrium among those who are actually in\npossession.\n\nWhat claims are being made in and about these stories? Are we to\nassume that one of them is literally true? Or what are we to infer\nfrom their falsity (if they are historically inaccurate)? Does it\nfollow that property is illegitimate? A number of philosophers have\nsuggested recently that a genealogy can make an important contribution\nto our understanding of a phenomenon even when it is not literally\ntrue: Bernard Williams (2002) has suggested this about language and\nthe emergence of truth-telling, following Edward Craig (1990)\u2019s\ngenealogical account of our possession of the concept of knowledge.\nRobert Nozick has also discussed the value of what he calls\n\u2018potential explanations\u2019\u2014stories that would explain\nhow something happened if certain things were the case (some of which\nin fact are not the case): \u2018To see how in principle, a whole\nrealm could fundamentally be explained greatly increases our\nunderstanding of the realm\u2026We learn much by seeing how the\nstate could have arisen, even if it didn\u2019t arise that way\u2019\n(Nozick 1974, pp. 8\u20139).\n\nThe genealogies we have considered may differ in this regard. The\nRousseau/Kant approach helps us understand why private property is\ninherently a matter of social concern and the Humean approach helps us\nsee the value of property in providing people with a fixed and\nmutually acknowledged basis on which the rest of social life can be\nbuilt, whether or not it answers to our independent intuitions of\njustice. But the Lockean genealogy may explain little or nothing about\nproperty entitlements unless it is actually true. As Nozick\nacknowledges (1974, pp. 151\u20132), a modern state should not feel\nmorally constrained by property holdings which might have had a\nLockean pedigree but in fact do not. In this regard it is interesting\nthat one of the main uses of Lockean theory these days is in defending\nthe property rights of indigenous people\u2014where a literal claim\nis being made about who had first possession of a set of resources and\nabout the need to rectify the injustices that accompanied their\nsubsequent expropriation (see Waldron 1992).\n\nFinally, we should not forget that not all genealogies set out to\nflatter the practices or institutions they purport to explain. Karl\nMarx\u2019s account of primitive accumulation (1976 [1867]) and\nJean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s non-normative description of the invention of\nproperty in the Discourse on the Origins of Inequality\n(Rousseau 1994 [1755]) are genealogies written more in a Nietzschean\nspirit of pathology than as part of any quest for justification. Such\nnegative genealogies reminds us of the importance of Mill\u2019s\nobservation that in approaching the justification of private property\nwe must remember that, \u2018we must leave out of consideration its\nactual origin in any of the existing nations of Europe\u2019 (Mill\n1994 [1848], p. 7).\n5. Justification: Liberty and Consequences\n\nThe justificatory issue might therefore be confronted directly,\nwithout invoking any sort of history or genealogical narrative.\n\nIn dealing with the pros and cons of private property as an\ninstitution, it has sometimes been suggested that the general\njustification of private property and the distribution of particular\nproperty rights can be treated as separate issues, rather in the way\nthat some philosophers suggested that the general justification of\npunishment can be separated from the principles governing its\ndistribution (Hart 1968, p. 4; see also Ryan 1984, p. 82 and Waldron\n1988, p. 330). In neither case, though, is the separation complete: it\nholds for some general justifications and not for others. In the\ntheory of punishment, a retributivist will believe that the principles\ngoverning punishment in general necessarily also regulate its\nparticular distribution. And there are analogues in the theory of\nproperty. Robert Nozick (1974) argued that a theory of historical\nentitlement, along Lockean lines, provides both a complete\njustification of the institution and a set of strict criteria that\ngovern its legitimate distribution. Property rights, according to\nNozick, constrain the extent to which we are entitled to act on our\nintuitions and theories about distributive justice. Consequentialist\ntheories, however, may be able to separate the institutional and\ndistributive issues in this way, and some theories of liberty may be\nable to do this also (though the distribution of liberty is itself\nsomething about which most libertarians have firm\u2014and\negalitarian!\u2014views). As we assess various distributive\narguments, then, it is a good idea to keep in mind the question of\nwhether or not they have direct or indirect distributive\nimplications.\n\nOn the other hand, it is surely important to keep in view the\n\u2018big picture\u2019 that a system of property presents (Singer\n2000 and Purdy 2011). What overall model of community is generated by\na given system of property rights and by the way they circulate in\nsociety? What kinds of inter-personal relations does a given\nsystem of property foster? What ethos of economic interaction does it\ngive rise to: an obsession with efficiency, an ethic of\ncompetitiveness, or a shared concern for those who are less well-off?\nThese questions are not distinct from questions about distribution,\nbut they look at them in a different light, not just asking about\ntheir moral justification one by one.\n\nThe most common form of justificatory argument is consequentialist:\npeople in general are better off when a given class of resources is\ngoverned by a private property regime than by any alternative system.\nUnder private property, it is said, the resources will be more wisely\nused, or used to satisfy a wider (and perhaps more varied) set of\nwants than under any alternative system, so that the overall enjoyment\nthat humans derive from a given stock of resources will be increased.\nThe most persuasive argument of this kind is sometimes referred to as\n\u2018the tragedy of the commons\u2019 (Hardin 1968). If everyone is\nentitled to use a given piece of land, then no one has an incentive to\nsee that crops are planted or that the land is not over-used. Or if\nanyone does take on this responsibility, they themselves are likely to\nbear all the costs of doing so (the costs of planting or the costs of\ntheir own self-restraint), while any benefits of their prudence will\naccrue to all subsequent users. And in many cases there will be no\nbenefits, since one individual\u2019s planning or restraint will be futile\nunless others cooperate. So, under a system of common property, each\ncommoner has an incentive to get as much as possible from the land as\nquickly as possible, since the benefits of doing this are in the\nshort-term concentrated and assured, while the long-term benefits of\nself-restraint are uncertain and diffused. However, if a piece of\nhitherto common land is divided into parcels and each parcel is\nassigned to a particular individual who can control what happens\nthere, then planning and self-restraint will have an opportunity to\nassert themselves. For now the person who bears the cost of restraint\nis in a position to reap all the benefits; so that if people are\nrational and if restraint (or some other form of forward-looking\nactivity) is in fact cost-effective, there will be an overall increase\nin the amount of utility derived.\n\nArguments of this sort are familiar and important, but like all\nconsequentialist arguments, they need to be treated with caution. In\nmost private property systems, there are some individuals who own\nlittle or nothing, and who are entirely at the mercy of others. So\nwhen it is said that \u2018people in general\u2019 are better off\nunder private property arrangements, we have to ask \u2018Which\npeople? Everyone? The majority? Or just a small class of owners whose\nprosperity is so great as to offset the consequent immiseration of the\nothers in an aggregative utilitarian calculus?\u2019 (Wenar 1998).\nJohn Locke hazarded the suggestion that everyone would be better off. \nComparing England, whose commons were swiftly being enclosed by\nprivate owners, to pre-colonial America, where the natives continued\nto enjoy universal common access to land, Locke speculated that\n\u2018a King of a large and fruitful Territory there [i.e. in\nAmerica] feeds, lodges, and is clad worse than a day Labourer in\nEngland.\u2019 (Locke 1988 [1689], II, para. 41) The laborer may not\nown anything, but his standard of living is higher on account of the\nemployment prospects that are offered in a prosperous privatized\neconomy. Alternatively, the more optimistic of the consequentialists\ncast their justifications in the language of what we would now call\n\u2018Pareto-improvement\u2019. Maybe the privatization of\npreviously common land does not benefit everybody: but it benefits\nsome and it leaves others no worse off than they were before. The\nhomelessness and immiseration of the poor, on this account, is not a\nresult of private property; it is simply the natural predicament of\nmankind from which a few energetic appropriators have managed to\nextricate themselves.\n\nSo far we have considered the consequentialist case for private\nproperty over common property. The consequentialist case for private\nproperty over collective property has more to do with markets than\nwith the need for responsibility and self-restraint in resource use.\nThe argument for markets is that in a complex society there are\ninnumerable decisions to be made about the allocation of particular\nresources to particular production processes. Is a given ton of coal\nbetter used to generate electricity which will in turn be used to\nrefine aluminum for manufacturing cooking pots or aircraft, or to\nproduce steel which can be used to build railway trucks, which may in\nturn be used to transport either cattle feed or bauxite from one place\nto another? In most economies there are hundreds of thousands of\ndistinct factors of production, and it has proved impossible for\nefficient decisions about their allocation to be made by central\nagencies acting in the name of the community and charged with\noverseeing the economy as a whole. In actually existing socialist\nsocieties, central planning turned out to be a way of ensuring\neconomic paralysis, inefficiency and waste (Mises 1951). In market\neconomies, decisions like these are made on a decentralized basis by\nthousands of individuals and firms responding to price signals, each\nseeking to maximize profits from the use of the productive resources\nunder its control, and such a system often works efficiently. Some\nhave speculated that there could be markets without private property\n(Rawls, 1971, p. 273), but this seems hopeless. Unless individual\nmanagers in a market economy are motivated directly or indirectly by\nconsiderations of personal profit in their investment and allocation\ndecisions, they cannot be expected to respond efficiently to prices.\nSuch motivation will occur only if the resources are privately owned,\nso that the loss is theirs (or their employer\u2019s) when a market signal\nis missed and the gain is theirs (or their employer\u2019s) when a\nprofitable allocation is secured.\n\nI said earlier that a consequentialist defense is in trouble unless it\ncan show that everyone is better off under a private property system,\nor at least that no-one is worse off. Now, a society in which all\ncitizens derive significant advantages from the privatization of the\neconomy is perhaps not an impossible ideal. But in every existing\nprivate property system there is a class of people who own little or\nnothing and who are arguably much worse off under that system than\nthey would be under a socialist alternative. A justificatory theory\ncannot ignore their predicament, if only because it is their\npredicament that poses the justificatory issue in the first place\n(Waldron 1993). A hard-line consequentialist may insist that the\nadvantages to those who profit from private ownership outweigh the\ncosts to the underclass. Philosophically, however, this sort of hard\nline is quite disreputable (Rawls 1971, pp. 22\u201333; Nozick 1974,\npp. 32\u20133). If we take the individual rather than a notional\nentity like \u2018the social good\u2019 as the focal point of moral\njustification, then there ought to be something we can say to\neach individual why the institution we are defending is\nworthy of her support. Otherwise it is not at all clear why\nshe should be expected to observe its rules (except when we\nhave the power and the numbers to compel her to do so).\n\nMaybe the consequentialist argument can be supplemented with an\nargument about desert in order to show that there is justice in some\npeople\u2019s enjoying the fruits of private property while others languish\nin poverty. If private property involves the wiser and more efficient\nuse of resources, it is because someone has exercised virtues of\nprudence, industry, and self-restraint. People who languish in\npoverty, on this account, do so largely because of their idleness,\nprofligacy or want of initiative. Now, theories like this are easily\ndiscredited if they purport to justify the actual distribution of\nwealth under an existing private property economy (Nozick 1974, pp.\n158\u20139; Hayek 1976). But there is a more modest position which\ndesert theorists can adopt: namely, that private property alone offers\na system in which idleness is not rewarded at the expense of industry,\na system in which those who take on the burdens of prudence and\nproductivity can expect to reap some reward for their virtue which\ndistinguishes them from those who did not make any such effort (Munzer\n1990, pp. 285 ff.).\n\nMany of the alleged market-advantages accrue only if private property\nis distributed in certain ways. Monopolistic control of the main\nfactors of production by a few individuals or corporations can play\nhavoc with market efficiency; and it can also lead to such great\nconcentrations of private power as to offset any argument for property\nbased on freedom, dissent or democracy. Distributive equity may be\ncrucial also for non-consequentialist arguments. The idea that\nproperty-owning promotes virtue is, as we have seen, as old as\nAristotle; and even today it is used by civic republicans as an\nargument against economic collectivism. According to this argument, if\nmost economic resources are owned in common or controlled collectively\nfor everyone\u2019s benefit, there is no guarantee that citizen\u2019s\nconditions of life will be such as to promote republican virtue. In a\ncommunist or collectivist society, citizens may behave either as\npassive beneficiaries of the state or irresponsible participants in a\ntragedy of the commons. If a generation or two grow up with that\ncharacter then the integrity of the whole society is in danger. These\narguments are interesting, but it is worth noting how sensitive they\nare to the distribution of property (Waldron 1986, pp. 323\u201342).\nAs T.H. Green observed, a person who owns nothing in a capitalist\nsociety \u2018might as well, in respect of the ethical purposes which\nthe possession of property should serve, be denied rights of property\naltogether\u2019 (Green 1941 [1895], p. 219).\n\nWe must also consider justificatory arguments that connect property\nwith liberty. Societies with private property are often described as\nfree societies. Part of what this means is surely that owners are free\nto use their property as they please; they are not bound by social or\npolitical decisions. (And correlatively, the role of government in\neconomic decision-making is minimized.) But that cannot be all that is\nmeant, for it would be equally apposite to describe private property\nas a system of unfreedom, since it necessarily involves the\nsocial exclusion of people from resources that others own. All\nproperty systems distribute freedoms and unfreedoms; no system of\nproperty can be described without qualification as a system of\nliberty. Someone may respond that the liberty to use what belongs to\nanother is license not liberty, and so its exclusion should not really\ncount against a private property system in the libertarian calculus. \nBut the price of this maneuver is very high: not only does it commit\nthe libertarian to a moralized conception of freedom of the sort that\nhe usually shies away from (as in case of positive liberty), but it\nalso means that liberty, so defined, can no longer be invoked to\nsupport property except in a question-begging way (Cohen 1982).\n\nTwo other things might be implied by the libertarian characterization.\nThe first is a point about independence: a person who owns a\nsignificant amount of private property\u2014a home, say, and a source\nof income\u2014has less to fear from the opinion and coercion of\nothers than the citizen of a society in which some other form of\nproperty predominates. The former inhabits, in a fairly literal sense,\nthe \u2018private sphere\u2019 that liberals have always treasured\nfor individuals\u2014a realm of action in which he need answer to\nno-one but himself. But like the virtue argument, this version of the\nlibertarian case is also sensitive to distribution: for those who own\nnothing in a private property economy would seem to be as\nunfree\u2014by this argument\u2014as anyone would be in a socialist\nsociety.\n\nThat last point may be too quick, however, for there are other\nindirect ways in which private property contributes to freedom (Purdy\n2005). Milton Friedman (1962) argues that political liberty is\nenhanced in a society where the means of intellectual and political\nproduction (printing presses, photocopying machines, computers) are\ncontrolled by a number of private individuals, firms, and\ncorporations\u2014even if that number is not very large. In a\ncapitalist society, a dissident has the choice of dealing with several\npeople (other than state officials) if he wants to get his message\nacross, and many of them are prepared to make their media available\nsimply on the basis of money, without regard to the message. In a\nsocialist society, by contrast, those who are politically active\neither have to persuade state agencies to disseminate their views, or\nrisk underground publication. More generally, Friedman argues, a\nprivate property society offers those who own nothing a greater\nvariety of ways in which they earn a living\u2014a larger menu of\nmasters, if you like\u2014than they would be offered in a socialist\nsociety. In these ways, private property for some may make a positive\ncontribution to freedom\u2014or at least an enhancement of\nchoice\u2014for everyone.\n\nFinally, in this review of direct normative arguments about property,\nwe should consider the moral importance property might have in respect\nof what it is, rather than what it does or brings about. Property\nrights in and of themselves give people a certain status and\nrecognition in society: a property owner is respected in his or her\ncontrol of a resource (Dorfman 2012). This is surely important; it\nwas, as we saw, one of the themes of the approach taken in Hegel 1967\nand in Kant 1991 (see Byrd and Hruschka 2006). But it can have critical\nimplications for property too, for if property is unevenly\ndistributed, if inequality is radical and some are more or less\ncomprehensively bereft of property rights, then acute issues have to\nbe faced about the uneven distribution of the bases of respect. We\ncannot take seriously the good that property rights do in regard to\nmoral recognition without also considering the inherent harm of\nabsence of such recognition in the case of those who own nothing.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ackerman, Bruce (1977), <em>Private Property and the\nConstitution</em>, New Haven: Yale University Press.", "Alexander, Gregory and Pe\u00f1alver, Eduardo (eds.)
