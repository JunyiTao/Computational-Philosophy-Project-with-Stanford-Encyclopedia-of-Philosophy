    "main_text": "Penal Law and Punishment\n7. Penal Law and Punishment\n\nCivil and penal law are inextricably connected in Bentham\u2019s\nlegal theory. Just as the primary purpose of civil law is economic\nsecurity and national prosperity, so it draws powerful support from\nthe protection afforded persons, property and expectations by the\nthreat of punishment (1838\u201343, III, 203). To this end,\nutilitarian penal law is framed in terms of the principal objective of\ndeterrence, but it also embraces the secondary ends of disablement,\nmoral reformation, and compensation (see Crimmins 2011). The\neffectiveness of the theory in practice depends on two additional\nfeatures: offences must be classified solely on the basis of the harm\nperpetrated, and there must be an appropriate proportion between\ncrimes and punishments. It is because of its failure to satisfy the\nfirst feature that Bentham (2014) rejected the prevailing\ncriminalization of consensual sexual acts, and developed the first\nsystematic defence of sexual liberty in the English language.\n\nIn settling the required proportions of punishment, Bentham recognised\nhe had burdened the legislator with a vastly complex task\u2014the\ncalculation of the correct quantity and type of pain needed to achieve\nthe desired ends, in particular the objective of deterrence. To guide\nthe legislator in proportioning punishments to offences he stipulated\nthirteen rules or \u201ccanons\u201d, such as that the punishment\nmust outweigh the profit of the offence, venture more against a great\noffence than a small one, punish for each particle of the mischief,\nand the like (1970, 167\u201371; see also Bedau, 2004; Draper, 2009).\nThe delineation of such guidelines to protect against\n\u201cunfrugal\u201d or excessive punishments is indicative of his\nattempt to be as comprehensive and as exact as possible while\nattending to practicalities. This is nowhere more apparent than in\nBentham\u2019s critical analysis of the death penalty.\n\nBentham first examined the utility of the death penalty in the 1770s\nwhen he delineated the principles of penal law (1838\u201343, I,\n441\u201350; see also 1970, Ch. XV), and followed this with an\nunpublished essay in 1809 in which he presented a critique of William\nPaley\u2019s defence of the death penalty in his Principles of\nMoral and Political Philosophy (1785), and in particular the use\nof discretionary pardons (UC cvii, 193\u2013277; Crimmins 1987). A\nfurther short essay \u201cOn Death-Punishment\u201d, published in\n1830, repeats many of the arguments from the first essay\n(1838\u201343, I, 525\u201332). Arguably, Bentham\u2019s\nutilitarian analysis of the issues raised by the death penalty in the\nfirst of these essays stands as the most thoroughgoing examination of\nthe question up to this time (Bedau 1983). In sum, it is a special\napplication of his utilitarian theory of punishment. The framework of\nanalysis is presented as an objective, neutral exercise, by which the\nbenefits and costs of the death penalty in cases of murder are\nassessed in comparison with life imprisonment with hard labour. All\nthings considered, Bentham believed the weight of the calculation\nworked against the death penalty on the grounds of deterrence, the\nfact that it is inequable in its application, falling mainly on the\nshoulders of the poor, and because it is a form of punishment that is\nirremissible in the face of judicial error. Nevertheless, at that time\nhe thought the death penalty might reasonably be maintained for murder\nwith aggravating circumstances and for cases of treason \u201cin\nwhich the name of the offender, so long as he lives, may be sufficient\nto keep a whole nation in a flame\u201d (1970 183). By 1809, however,\nhe abandoned the exceptions and argued that no offence warranted\ncapital punishment (UC cvii. 201).\n",
