    "main_text": "\n\nIntuitionism is a philosophy of mathematics that was introduced by the\nDutch mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer (1881\u20131966). Intuitionism is\nbased on the idea that mathematics is a creation of the mind. The\ntruth of a mathematical statement can only be conceived via a mental\nconstruction that proves it to be true, and the communication between\nmathematicians only serves as a means to create the same mental\nprocess in different minds.\n\nThis view on mathematics has far reaching implications for the daily\npractice of mathematics, one of its consequences being that the\nprinciple of the excluded middle, \\((A \\vee \\neg A)\\), is no longer\nvalid. Indeed, there are propositions, like the Riemann hypothesis,\nfor which there exists currently neither a proof of the statement nor\nof its negation. Since knowing the negation of a statement in\nintuitionism means that one can prove that the statement is not true,\nthis implies that both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) do not hold\nintuitionistically, at least not at this moment. The dependence of\nintuitionism on time is essential: statements can become provable in\nthe course of time and therefore might become intuitionistically valid\nwhile not having been so before.\n\nBesides the rejection of the principle of the excluded middle,\nintuitionism strongly deviates from classical mathematics in the\nconception of the continuum, which in the former setting has the\nproperty that all total functions on it are continuous. Thus, unlike\nseveral other theories of constructive mathematics, intuitionism is\nnot a restriction of classical reasoning; it contradicts classical\nmathematics in a fundamental way.\n\nBrouwer devoted a large part of his life to the development of\nmathematics on this new basis. Although intuitionism has never\nreplaced classical mathematics as the standard view on mathematics, it\nhas always attracted a great deal of attention and is still widely\nstudied today.\n\nIn this entry we concentrate on the aspects of intuitionism that set\nit apart from other branches of constructive mathematics, and the part\nthat it shares with other forms of constructivism, such as\nfoundational theories and models, is discussed only briefly.\n",
