    "main_text": "Well-being and Morality || Welfarism\n5.1 Welfarism\n\nWell-being obviously plays a central role in any moral theory. A\ntheory which said that it just does not matter would be given no\ncredence at all. Indeed, it is very tempting to think that well-being,\nin some ultimate sense, is all that can matter morally. Consider, for\nexample, Joseph Raz\u2019s \u2018humanistic principle\u2019:\n\u2018the explanation and justification of the goodness or badness of\nanything derives ultimately from its contribution, actual or possible,\nto human life and its quality\u2019 (Raz 1986, p. 194). If we expand\nthis principle to cover non-human well-being, it might be read as\nclaiming that, ultimately speaking, the justificatory force of any\nmoral reason rests on well-being. This view is welfarism.\n\nAct-utilitarians, who believe that the right action is that which\nmaximizes well-being overall, may attempt to use the intuitive\nplausibility of welfarism to support their position, arguing that any\ndeviation from the maximization of well-being must be grounded on\nsomething distinct from well-being, such as equality or rights. But\nthose defending equality may argue that egalitarians are concerned to\ngive priority to those who are worse off, and that we do see here a\nlink with concern for well-being. Likewise, those concerned with\nrights may note that we have rights to certain goods, such as freedom,\nor to the absence of \u2018bads\u2019, such as suffering (in the\ncase of the right not to be tortured, for example). In other words,\nthe interpretation of welfarism is itself a matter of dispute. But,\nhowever it is understood, it does seem that welfarism poses a problem\nfor those who believe that morality can require actions which benefit\nno one, and harm some, such as, for example, punishments intended to\ngive individuals what they deserve.\n",
