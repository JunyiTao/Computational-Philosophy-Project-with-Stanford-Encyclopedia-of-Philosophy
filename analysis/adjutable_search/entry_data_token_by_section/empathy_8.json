    "main_text": "Empathy, Moral Philosophy, and Moral Psychology || Empathy and Altruistic Motivation\n5.1 Empathy and Altruistic Motivation\n\nIn a series of ingeniously designed experiments, Batson has\naccumulated evidence for what he calls the empathy-altruism thesis. In\narguing for this thesis, Batson conceives of empathy as empathic\nconcern or what others would call sympathy. More specifically, he\ncharacterized it in terms of feelings of being sympathetic, moved by,\nbeing compassionate, tender, warm and soft-hearted towards the\nother\u2019s plight (Batson et al. 1987, 26) The task of his\nexperiments consists in showing that empathy/sympathy does indeed lead\nto genuinely altruistic motivation, where the welfare of the other is\nthe ultimate goal of my helping behavior, rather than to helping\nbehavior because of predominantly egoistic motivations. According to\nthe egoistic interpretation of empathy\u2013related phenomena,\nempathizing with another person in need is associated with a negative\nfeeling or can lead to a heightened awareness of the negative\nconsequences of not helping; such as feelings of guilt, shame, or\nsocial sanctions. Alternatively, it can lead to an enhanced\nrecognition of the positive consequences of helping behavior such as\nsocial rewards or good feelings. Empathy according to this\ninterpretation induces us to help through mediation of purely egoistic\nmotivations. We help others only because we recognize helping behavior\nas a means to egoistic ends. It allows us to reduce our negative\nfeelings (aversive arousal reduction hypothesis), to avoid\n\u201cpunishment,\u201d or to gain specific internal or external\n\u201crewards\u201d (empathy-specific punishment and\nempathy-specific reward hypotheses).\n\nNotice however that in arguing for the empathy-altruism thesis, Batson\nis not claiming that empathy always induces helping behavior. Rather,\nhe argues against the predominance of an egoistic interpretation of an\nagent\u2019s motivational structure. He argues for the existence of\ngenuinely altruistic motivations and more specifically for the claim\nthat empathy causes such genuinely altruistic motivation. These\ngenuinely altruistic motives (together with other egoistic motives)\nare taken into account by the individual agent in deliberating about\nwhether or not to help. Even for Batson, the question of whether the\nagent will act on his or her altruistic motivations depends ultimately\non how strong they are and what costs the agent would incur in helping\nanother person.\n\nThe basic set up of Batson\u2019s experiments consists in the\nmanipulation of the situation of the experimental subjects (dependent\non the egoistic alternative to be argued against) and the manipulation\nof empathy/sympathy felt for an observed target in need. The decisive\nevidence for the empathy/sympathy-altruism thesis is always the\nrecorded behavior of the subject, who is in a high empathy condition\nand in a situation where his helping behavior can not plausibly be\nseen as a means for the satisfaction of a personal goal. Since here is\nnot the place to extensively describe the details of Batson\u2019s\nexperiments, a brief description of the experimental set\nup\u2014focusing on Batson\u2019s argument against the aversive\narousal interpretation of empathy\u2014and a brief evaluation of the\nsuccess of his general argumentative strategy has to suffice (for more\ndetails see Batson 1991 and 2011). In all of his experiments, Batson\nassumes\u2014based on Stotland (1969) and others\u2014that\nempathy/sympathy can be manipulated either by manipulating the\nperceived similarity between subjects and targets or by manipulating\nthe perspective taking attitude of the subjects. Empathy according to\nthese assumptions can be increased by enhancing the perceived\nsimilarity between subject and target or by asking the subject to\nimagine how the observed person would feel in his or her situation\nrather than asking the subject to attend carefully to the information\nprovided. [Note also that instructing the subject to imagine how they\nthemselves would feel in the other\u2019s situation, rather than\ninstructing them to imagine how the other feels, is associated with an\nincrease in personal distress and not only sympathetic feelings.\n(Batson et al. 1997b and Lamm, Batson, and Decety 2007).]\n\nIn trying to argue against the aversive arousal reduction\ninterpretation, Batson also manipulates the ease with which a subject\ncan avoid helping another person (in this case taking his place when\nthey see him getting electric shocks). He reasons that if empathy\nleads to genuinely altruistic motivations, subjects in the high\nempathy/easy escape condition should still be willing to help. If they\nwere only helping in order to reduce their own negative feelings, they\nwould be expected to leave in this situation, since leaving is the\nless costly means for reaching an egoistic goal. As Batson was happy\nto report, the results confirmed his empathy/sympathy-altruism\nhypothesis, not only in the above experiments but also in experiments\ntesting other alternative interpretations of empathy such as the\nempathy- specific punishment and the empathy-specific award\nhypotheses.\n\nResearchers generally agree in finding Batson\u2019s experimental\nresearch program and the accumulated evidence for the empathy-altruism\nthesis to be impressive. Yet they disagree about how persuasive one\nshould ultimately regard his position. In particular it has been\npointed out that his experiments have limited value, since they target\nonly very specific egoistic accounts of why empathy might lead to\nhelping behavior. Batson is not able to dismiss conclusively every\nalternative egoistic interpretation. In addition, it has been claimed\nthat egoism has the resources to account for the result of his\nexperiments. For example, one might challenge the validity of\nBatson\u2019s interpretation by speculating whether empathy/sympathy\nleads to a heightened awareness of the fact that one will be troubled\nby bad memories of seeing another person in need, if one does nothing\nto help him or her. In this case even an egoistically motivated person\nwould help in the high empathy/easy escape condition. (For this reply\nand various other egoistic interpretations of Batson\u2019s\nexperiments see Sober and Wilson 1998, 264\u2013271).\n\nCialdini and his collaborators have suggested an even more elaborate\nnon-altruistic interpretation of helping behavior in high empathy/easy\nescape conditions. According to their suggestions, conditions of high\nempathy are also conditions of increased \u201cinterpersonal unity,\nwherein the conception of self and other are not distinct but are\nmerged to some degree\u201d (Cialdini et al. 1997, 490). It is this\nincreased feeling of oneness rather than empathy that is causally\nresponsible for motivating helping behavior (See however Batson et al.\n1997a, Neuberg et al. 1997, and Batson 1997 and 2011 for a plausible\nreply and May 2018, 144\u2013153 for a probing discussion of the\nrelation between empathic concern and oneness). One therefore has to\nbe cautious in claiming that Batson has conclusively proven that the\nempathy/sympathy-altruism hypothesis is true, if that means one has\nlogically excluded every egoistic alternative in accounting for\nhelping behavior. But it has to be acknowledged that Batson has\nradically changed the argumentative dialectic of the egoism-altruism\ndebate by forcing the egoistic account of human agency to come up with\never more elaborate alternative interpretations in order to account\nfor helping behavior within its framework. Egoism was supposed to\nprovide a rather unified and relatively simple account of the\nmotivational structure of human agency. In challenging the\npredominance and simplicity of this framework in an empirically acute\nfashion, Batson has at least established altruism\u2014claiming that\nbesides egoistic motivations we are also motivated by genuinely\naltruistic reasons\u2014as an empirically plausible hypothesis. He\nhas shown it to be a hypothesis one is almost persuaded to believe\nthat it is true, as he himself recently has characterized his own\nepistemic attitude (Batson 1997, 522.) More positively expressed,\nBatson\u2019s research has at least demonstrated that\nempathy/sympathy is a causal factor in bringing about helping\nbehavior. Regardless of the question of the exact nature of the\nunderlying motivation for helping or prosocial behavior, psychologists\ngenerally assume that in adults and children a positive, even if weak,\ncorrelation between empathy\u2014measured in a variety of\nways\u2014and prosocial behavior has been established; and this\ndespite the fact that the above aspects of emotional responding to\nanother person have not always been sufficiently distinguished.(For a\nsurvey see Eisenberg and Miller 1987; Eisenberg/Fabes 1998, Spinrad\nand Eisenberg 2014. For a general survey of the various factors\ncontributing to prosocial behavior see Bierhoff 2002).\n\nRegardless of how exactly one views the strength of Batson\u2019s\nposition, his research alone does not validate the thesis, articulated\nby various traditional moral philosophers, that sympathy or empathy is\nthe basis of morality or that it constitutes the only source for moral\nmotivation. First, nothing in his research has shown that\nempathy/sympathy is empirically necessary for moral agency. Second,\nsome of Batson\u2019s own research casts doubt on the claim that\nsympathy/empathy is the foundation of morality as empathy induced\naltruism can lead to behavior that conflicts with our principles of\njustice and fairness. One, for example, tends to assign a better job\nor a higher priority for receiving medical treatment to persons with\nwhom one has actually sympathized, in violation of the above moral\nprinciples (See Batson et al. 1995). For that very reason, Batson\nhimself distinguishes between altruistic motivation concerned with the\nwell-being of another person and moral motivation guided by principles\nof justice and fairness (Batson 2011). Unfortunately we do not always\nrealize this fact when we abstractly contrast moral motivation broadly\nwith egoistic motivation. For that very reason, we also do not realize\nthat we need to be more conscious in \u201corchestrating\u201d the\nrelationship between altruistic and moral motivations in order to\nfully utilize the motivational power of altruism for moral purposes\n(Batson 2014). Finally, the research discussed so far is not relevant\nfor deciding the question of whether sophisticated mindreading\nabilities are required for full blown moral agency, since Batson\nunderstands empathy primarily as an emotional phenomenon. (See Nichols\n2001 and Batson et al. 2003 in this respect.)\n",
