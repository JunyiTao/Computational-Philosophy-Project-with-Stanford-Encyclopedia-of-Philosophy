    "main_text": "Analytic Ontology of Dance as Art || Dance as Ephemeral Art\n1.2 Dance as Ephemeral Art\n\nOne of the features of dance as a performing art that has been often\nnoted is that it moves and it changes, both during the course of any\ngiven performance and over time. A catchall phrase for this sort of\nimpermanence\u2014reflecting the lack of entirely stable art\n\u201cobjects\u201d in every case\u2014has been to say that\n\u201cdance is an ephemeral art\u201d, although there are\nalternative versions of what this means (see Conroy 2012; see also\nCopeland and Cohen 1983 and Copeland 1993. This does not mean that\ndance is insubstantial or unserious. Instead, what it means is that\nthere is something vital about dance performances and events that\ndisappears as it is being performed. As noted in\n Section 3,\n above, this may or may not distinguish dance from theater or music,\nalthough dance does seem to rely less on recordings and written\nnotations in the making and performing of dances overall.\n\nDance critic Marcia Siegel famously wrote that dance \u201cexists as\na perpetual vanishing point\u201d, which means for Siegel that dance\nexists in \u201can event that disappears in the very act of\nmaterializing.\u201d (1972: 1). Siegel posits that dance has escaped\nthe mass marketing of the industrial revolution \u201cprecisely\nbecause it doesn\u2019t lend itself to any\nreproduction\u2026\u201d (1972: 5). Conroy (2012: 158) acknowledges\nthat the \u201csafest\u201d ontological interpretation of\nSiegel\u2019s claim would suggest that dance performances are\none-time, transient events. If this is the case it would mean that\nthere is no enduring \u201ctype\u201d that constitutes a dance work\nof art that is \u201ctokened\u201d by various instancing\nperformances. This would mean that the \u201cclassical\nparadigm\u201d discussed by D. Davies (2011b) and upheld by Goodman\n(1976) and by McFee (2011b and 2018) is wrong. If we hold that\nsome dance performances are transient but not others, then\nthe classical paradigm would still need to account for those\nperformances that do not fit, much like the ontology of music has had\nto deal with the ontology of highly or entirely improvised jazz\nperformances that seem to be \u201cone-offs\u201d and that are not\npreserved via recording. (See Anna Pakes\u2019 forthcoming book,\nChoreography Invisible: The Disappearing Work of Dance, for\nmore on this issue.)\n\nMcFee (2011b; also see 2018) believes that the instability of dance\nworks of art is a problem that is due to poor preservation and\nreconstruction of dances rather than a feature that tells us something\nmeaningful about the nature of dance. He also thinks that dance\nnotation might be developed in the future to provide a workable way to\npreserve and reconstruct dances, something that Van Camp and Franko\nsuggest may not be possible (the specifics of their claims here can be\nfound in\n Section 2\n of this entry, above). We can take this to be the negative view of\nthe ephemerality of dance.\n\nA positive version of dance as an ephemeral art, however, is one that\nholds that we ought to appreciate, rather than decry, dance\u2019s\never-changing and disappearing nature as something that makes a live\nperformance of a dance that will not happen again the same way into a\nvital experience for both the dance performers and the audience. The\npositive account celebrates the live nature of the dance performance\nand helps to explain why kinesthetic responses to dance performances\nare both relevant and powerful. It also suggests that ephemerality is\nan aesthetic value for dance that gives dance the ability to provide a\n\u201cyou had to be there\u201d sort of event. (See Bresnahan 2014a\nfor an account of improvisational artistry in live dance performance\nas a sort of agency that is consistent with this positive view.)\nConroy agrees with McFee that the phrase \u201cdance is an ephemeral\nart\u201d does apply to the difficulty of preserving dances, but she\nalso thinks it should be conceived as a statement of a danceworld\nvalue; as a way of conveying \u201ca communal attitude of tolerance\nfor change with respect to choreography that has been previously\nperformed\u201d (2012: 160).\n",
