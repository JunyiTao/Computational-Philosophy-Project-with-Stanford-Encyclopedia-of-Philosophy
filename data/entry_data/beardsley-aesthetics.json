    "preamble": "\n\nMonroe Beardsley (1915\u20131985) was born and raised in Bridgeport,\nConnecticut, and educated at Yale University (B.A. 1936, Ph.D. 1939).\nHe taught at a number of colleges and universities, including Mt.\nHolyoke College and Yale University, but most of his career was spent\nat Swarthmore College (22 years) and Temple University (16 years).\n\nBeardsley is best known for his work in aesthetics\u2014and this\narticle will deal exclusively with his work in that area\u2014but he\nwas an extremely intellectually curious man, and published articles in\na number of areas, including the philosophy of history, action theory,\nand the history of modern philosophy. Indeed, his interests\nweren\u2019t confined to \u201cpure philosophy\u201d or even to\nphilosophy broadly conceived. Practical Logic, his first book\n(1950), was one of the first informal logic or critical thinking texts\nof the contemporary era, and Thinking Straight, (1950) a\nrelated book, saw four very different editions over a period of 25\nyears. Outside of philosophy, he wrote literary criticism and books\nand articles on style, writing, and the humanities. In short,\nBeardsley had broad humanistic interests that were centered in\nphilosophy, and aesthetics in particular.\n\nThree books and a number of articles form the core of\nBeardsley\u2019s work in aesthetics. Of the books, the first,\nAesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism (1958;\nreissued with a postscript, 1981), is by far the most substantial,\ncomprehensive, and influential. More than that, it\u2019s also the\nfirst systematic, well-argued, and critically informed philosophy of\nart in the analytic tradition. Although not the main purpose of the\nbook, it showed that analytic philosophy and a keen interest in the\narts needn\u2019t exist in isolation but can, and should, inform each\nother. It\u2019s part of the book\u2019s achievement that\nthat\u2019s taken for granted today. It wasn\u2019t at the time it\nwas written, and many people, both in Anglo-American philosophical\ncircles and in art-critical circles, thought exactly the opposite in\nthe mid-1950s. Given the wide range of topics covered in\nAesthetics, the intelligent and philosophically informed\ntreatment accorded them, the historically unprecedented nature of the\nwork, and its effect on subsequent developments in the field, a number\nof philosophers, including some of Beardsley\u2019s critics, have\nargued that Aesthetics is the most impressive and important\nbook of twentieth century analytic aesthetics.\n\nThe Possibility of Criticism (1970), the second of the three\nbooks, is more modest in scope and less groundbreaking. Exclusively\nconcerned with literary criticism, it limits itself to four problems:\nthe \u201cself-sufficiency\u201d of a literary text, the nature of\nliterary interpretation, judging literary texts, and bad poetry. Views\npropounded and defended in Aesthetics are further explained\nand defended in The Possibility, and several new concepts,\nfor instance, that of an illocutionary act, are introduced and put to\nwork. As with all of Beardsley\u2019s writing, many poets, novelists,\nshort story writers, essayists, critics, and philosophers are quoted\nand discussed. The style, tone, and approach are also characteristic\nBeardsley: eminently clear and guileless prose, gentle in tone but\nfirm in argumentation.\n\nThe last of the books, The Aesthetic Point of View (1982), is\na collection of papers, most old, some new. The book takes its title\nfrom the lead article, but the title is also emblematic, indicating\nBeardsley\u2019s approach to the philosophy of art as a whole: the\nnecessity of taking the aesthetic point of view. Fourteen papers,\nlargely on the nature of the aesthetic and art criticism, are\nreprinted, and six new pieces are added. The new pieces are of special\ninterest because they constitute Beardsley\u2019s final word on the\ntopics covered, and the topics are themselves central ones: aesthetic\nexperience, the definition of art, judgments of value, reasons in art\ncriticism, artists\u2019 intentions and interpretation, and art and\nculture.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Background\n\nIn Aesthetics, Beardsley develops a philosophy of art that is\nsensitive to three things:\n\nart itself and people\u2019s pre-philosophical interest in and\nopinions about art,\ncritics\u2019 pronouncements about art, and\ndevelopments in philosophy, especially, though not exclusively,\nthose in the analytic tradition.\n\n\nMore than anyone else, Beardsley took a love of the arts, independent\nof overarching philosophical commitments, seriously, and tried to make\nsense of it. Although he didn\u2019t automatically defer to\npre-reflective opinion about or interest in art, he, like Aristotle,\nthought they deserved respect\u00a0and balked at any philosophy of art\nthat didn\u2019t make contact with them, or cavalierly dismissed or\noverrode them. His was a philosophy of art based on a love of the\narts\u2014that, and not a love of philosophy or any agenda,\npsychological, political, religious, philosophical, or otherwise. The\ncopious examples and discussions of individual works of art in his\nwritings illustrate as much, as do his philosophical arguments and\nconclusions. Much the same can be said of his concern with, and\nrespect for, but far from automatic deference to, the remarks of art\ncritics.\n\nThe historical backdrop against which Beardsley developed his\nphilosophy of art in the late 1940s and early 1950s includes the three\nelements mentioned at the beginning of the preceding paragraph. There\nwere developments in the arts\u2014new forms in music, painting, and\nliterature had appeared and were appearing\u2014but there was also a\nwell-established and relatively large canon of works almost\nuniversally regarded as aesthetically superior and worthy of\nattention. Art criticism had become an industry, with major schools of\nall sorts flourishing: Marxist, Formalist, psychoanalytic, semiotic,\nhistorical, biographical. And philosophy had changed in rapid and\nunexpected ways. Analytic philosophy, with its emphasis on language\nand strong empiricist tendencies, had gained ascendancy in American\nuniversities in little more than 20 years, and dominated the\nphilosophical scene.\n\nBeardsley responded to each of the three. His position on developments\nin the arts is probably best described as open-minded moderation. He\nwelcomed new developments, and reference to new works and works that\nlack the luster of fame, notoriety, or ready recognition appear\nfrequently in Aesthetics and his other work. He didn\u2019t\nautomatically embrace the latest fad, fashion, or movement, however,\nbut tried, as he said, to get something out of a work. Failing that, a\nwork could be ignored, though tentatively and perhaps\ntemporarily\u2014the fault might be his and not the object\u2019s,\nhe always thought. Certainly, though, the well-established works of\nthe Western tradition\u2014the Bachs, Goyas, and Popes\u2014had to\nbe respected and accounted for in any philosophy of art worthy of the\nname.\n\nAs for art criticism, Beardsley thought that a great deal of it read\nlike the ruminations of a batter who kept his eyes on the scoreboard,\nthe fans, his contract, his place in history, or his wife in the\nstands\u2014instead of on the ball. Much of it, in other words,\nignored what should be the main object of attention, the work itself.\nThe school of criticism that attracted Beardsley, and that his\nphilosophy of art ultimately underwrites, is the so-called New\nCriticism. Based in literature, the New Criticism made the literary\nwork the center of critical attention, and denied, or at least greatly\ndevaluated, the relevance of facts about the origin of literary works,\ntheir effects upon individual readers, and their personal, social, and\npolitical influence. Close reading is what is required of a critic,\nnot biographical information about the author, a rundown of the state\nof society at the time the work was written, data about the psychology\nof creation, predictions about the effects of the work on society, and\ncertainly not a piece of autobiography detailing the critic\u2019s\nown personal response to the work. New Critics were explicators more\nthan anything else, and investigated literary works, and especially\npoetry, as if they were found objects\u2014worthwhile ores, rare\njewels, and mundane rocks, each with its own unique properties. As an\nexpert assayer, the critic must thoroughly and sensitively examine the\nobjects before him in order to discover their exact nature and, in the\nbest cases, special value. The rallying cry, in Allen Tate\u2019s\nwords, was, \u201cWe must return to, we must never leave, the poem\nitself\u201d (Tate 1955, 63). Much the same sentiment is expressed in\nBeardsley\u2019s remark that \u201c[the critic\u2019s] task is to\nkeep [his] eye on\u2026 textual meaning\u201d (PC: 34). Though\nbased in literary criticism, the New Criticism could be, and should\nbe, extended to the other arts, Beardsley thought: all art criticism\nshould make a serious effort to recognize its objects as special,\nautonomous, and important in their own right, and not subservient to\nulterior aims or values; all art criticism should attempt to\nunderstand how works of art work\u00a0and what meanings and aesthetic\nproperties they have; all art criticism should strive for objective\nand publicly accessible methods and standards to test its\npronouncements. The New Criticism did just that, and did what other\ncriticism, and especially Romantic criticism (in a broad sense of the\nterm), did not: studiously focused on the work of art itself, as an\nobject existing in its own right, with its own properties. Far too\nmuch criticism was essentially Romantic, the New Critics thought, and\nconcentrated on the artist, not the art.\n\nDevelopments in philosophy were a different story. In general, the\nphilosophy of art has always been regarded as a backwater by\nphilosophers, as by far the least rigorous and least important of the\nmajor branches of the field (a sentiment that remains widespread\ntoday), but the low regard in which aesthetics was held was even more\npronounced at the time that Beardsley began work on\nAesthetics. In its early, palmy days, analytic philosophy\ntended toward logical positivism, which dismissed judgments of\naesthetic value\u2014the core of art criticism, in Beardsley\u2019s\nestimation\u2014as cognitively meaningless, and ordinary language\nphilosophy, a species of analytic philosophy that flourished briefly\nafter World War Two, was unsystematic in its treatment of problems and\neven anti-systematic in its objectives\u2014strong philosophical\ntheses were either verboten, a sign of mistake, or an aberration.\nNeither brand of analytic philosophy boded well for aesthetics as a\nsystematic field of study. There was, however, also a general form of\nanalytic philosophy not connected with either approach, that is,\nanalytic philosophy without an overarching commitment to the scientism\nof logical positivism or the dogged adherence to everyday language of\nordinary language philosophy. Philosophers like Bertrand Russell, G.E.\nMoore, and C.D. Broad, among many others, were analysts without an\nagenda, and Beardsley was more in their camp\u2014that is, no\ndefinite camp of analytic philosophy at all\u2014than anyone\nelse\u2019s. For him, an analytic approach to the philosophy of art\nmeant no more than critically examining the fundamental concepts and\nbeliefs underlying art and art criticism. Doing philosophy of that\nsort required clarity, precision, and a good eye for identifying,\nexposing, and evaluating arguments, but left aesthetics, as a\nsystematic study, as a real possibility.\n2. The Nature of Aesthetics\n\nNot all the arts could be covered in detail in even so long a book as\nAesthetics\u2014it\u2019s over 600 pages\u2014so Beardsley\nhad to content himself with concentrating on three relatively\ndisparate arts:\u00a0literature, music, and painting. In keeping with\nthe conception of philosophy mentioned above, aesthetics was thought\nof as meta-criticism. \u201cThere would be no problems of\naesthetics\u201d, Beardsley says, \u201cif no one ever talked about\nworks of art\u2026. We can\u2019t do aesthetics until we have some\ncritical statements to work on\u201d (Aesth: 1, 4]).\nAesthetics is concerned with \u201cthe nature and basis of\ncriticism,\u2026 just as criticism itself is concerned with works of\nart\u201d (Aesth: 6). The then-current and still widespread\nview that philosophy is a second-order, meta-level, and essentially\nlinguistic activity, taking as its object of study the pronouncements\nof first-order activities, such as chemistry, religion, or history, is\nreflected in Beardsley\u2019s view on the nature of aesthetics.\n\nIt\u2019s a problematic view, however, and one somewhat belied by\nBeardsley\u2019s own philosophic practice. Questions like, What sort\nof being or existence do works of art have?\u2014a question of\nontology, and one of Beardsley\u2019s questions\u2014arise from the\nstatements of art critics only in that critics use the term\n\u2019work of art\u2019 and, with that concept available, inquiry\ninto the ontological status of the objects that answer to it is then\npossible. But the question isn\u2019t itself one that arises out of,\nor concerns the nature and basis of, critical practice, at least not\nin any significant sense of the term. For one thing, others besides\ncritics use the term \u201cwork of art\u201d\u2014art dealers and\nart suppliers, for example\u2014so the case could just as easily be\nmade that the ontological question arises out of, and concerns the\nnature and basis of, art dealership or art supply-manship. A related\npoint is that the same argument applies outside the arts. Farmers and\ngrocers speak of apples, and unless we had some such term as\n\u201capple\u201d, the question, What sort of being or existence do\napples have?\u2014again, a question of ontology\u2014couldn\u2019t\nbe posed. It isn\u2019t a question that arises out of the cultivation\nor sale of apples, however\u2014not in any very direct or meaningful\nway\u2014nor is it one that concerns the nature and basis of apple\nfarming or running a supermarket. Critics, like farmers and art\nsuppliers, do very well without ontological inquiries; ontological\nquestions don\u2019t lurk in the background, waiting to be asked. In\nshort, Beardsley\u2019s meta-philosophical view that aesthetics is\nmeta-criticism is underdetermined by the reasons that he advances for\nit, inaccurate or correct only if the term\n\u201cmeta-criticism\u201d is stretched beyond its usual bounds, and\nbelied to some extent by Beardsley\u2019s own\nphilosophic\u00a0practice. All of that is not to deny, however, that a\ngreat deal of aesthetics can be profitably viewed as meta-critical, as\na critical examination and evaluation of the nature and basis of at\nleast some of the statements that art critics make, at least if art\ncritics are conceived broadly enough to include almost everyone who\nhas ever stood before a painting, listened to a piece of music, or\nread a novel, and then ventured a judgment about it.\n\nCritical statements are of three kinds, Beardsley thinks: descriptive,\ninterpretative, and evaluative. The first concerns non-normative\nproperties of works of art that are simply in it, in some sense, and\nare available, at least in principle, to anyone of normal eyes and\nears if sufficiently sensitive, attentive, and experienced.\n\u201cThere is a small red patch in the upper right-hand corner of\nthe painting\u201d is a descriptive statement, but so is\n\u201cHaydn\u2019s 23rd Symphony abounds in\ndynamic tension\u201d. The philosophical problems that descriptive\nstatements give rise to involve the concept of form, Beardsley thinks.\nInterpretive statements are also non-normative but concern the\n\u201cmeaning\u201d of a work of art, with \u201cmeaning\u201d\nhere referring to a semantic relation, or at least a purported\nsemantic relation, between the work and (a small number of exceptions\naside) something outside it. \u201cThat\u2019s a picture of Notary\nSojac\u201d is an interpretive statement, as are \u201cThat\u2019s\na picture of a unicorn\u201d, \u201cThe passage refers to\nBrutus\u2019s betrayal of Caesar\u201d, and \u201cThe thesis of\nMacbeth is exceedingly simple: Thou shalt not kill\u201d.\nLast, critical evaluations are normative judgments that basically say\nthat a work of art is good or bad, or how good or bad it is.\n\u201cMozart\u2019s \u2018Turkish March\u2019 is an excellent\nshort piano piece\u201d is a critical evaluation, and so is\n\u201c\u2018The Face on the Barroom Floor\u2019 is wretched\nverse\u201d. The judgment \u201cThis is beautiful\u201d\u2014the\nparadigm of a judgment of taste according to Kant\u2014is sometimes\nthought of as a critical evaluation (Aesth: 9), but more\noften (e.g., Aesth: 463, 507), and always in\nBeardsley\u2019s later writing, as a descriptive judgment, and one\nthat frequently forms at least a partial basis for a critical\nevaluation.\n3. The Ontology of Art: Phenomenalism and Friends\n\nThe first chapter of Aesthetics is in part devoted to the\nontology of art\u2014or aesthetic objects, as Beardsley was then wont\nto say. The term \u201cwork of art\u201d was largely avoided by him\nat the time, because, as he later admitted, he did\n\n\nnot [want] to become enmeshed\u2026 in [the question of the\ndefinition of \u201cwork of art\u201d, a question] that\u2026\n[had] not convince[d] [him] of its importance or promise[d] any very\nsatisfactory and agreeable resolution.\u00a0(Aesth:\nxviii)\n\n\nThat was to change, and Beardsley later did offer a definition of art.\nIn any case, it\u2019s the ontology of \u201caesthetic\nobjects\u201d that\u2019s first discussed in\nAesthetics.\n\nThe ontology argued for begins with a distinction between physical\nobjects and perceptual objects. In speaking of a thing being six feet\nby six feet in size and at rest, we\u2019re speaking of a physical\nobject; in speaking of a thing being dynamic and frightening,\nwe\u2019re speaking of a perceptual object. Perceptual objects are\nthe objects we perceive, objects \u201csome of whose qualities, at\nleast, are open to direct sensory awareness\u201d (Aesth:\n31). Aesthetic objects are a subset of perceptual objects. This\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily mean that aesthetic objects aren\u2019t\nphysical objects, however. Aesthetic objects might be other than\nphysical objects\u2014the conceptual distinction might mark a real\ndistinction\u2014or they might be physical objects\u2014the\nconceptual distinction, though somewhat misleadingly couched in terms\nof objects, might simply mark \u201ctwo aspects of the same\u201d\nthing (Aesth: 33). At first indifferent as to which\nalternative is opted for\u2014Beardsley mentions that he\ndoesn\u2019t \u201csee that it makes much difference which\nterminology [that of objects or aspects] is chosen\u201d\n(ibid.)\u2014he then proceeds to develop an ontology that stresses\nobjects more than aspects.\n\nThe ontology is phenomenalistic in its leanings, though open to a more\nphysicalist interpretation. A presentation of an aesthetic object is\ndefined as the object as experienced by a particular person on a\nparticular occasion. Essentially, presentations are sense-data of\naesthetic objects. Aesthetic objects aren\u2019t presentations,\nhowever, for that would invite not just an uncontrollable population\nexplosion of aesthetic objects, but chaos in criticism; and neither\nare aesthetic objects classes of presentations, for aesthetic objects\nmust have at least some perceptual properties, but classes, as\nabstract entities, have none. However,\n\n\nwhenever we want to say anything about an aesthetic object, we can\ntalk about its presentations.\u00a0(Aesth: 54)\n\n\nThis, Beardsley says,\n\n\ndoes not \u201creduce\u201d the aesthetic object to a presentation;\nit only analyzes statements about aesthetic objects into\nstatements about presentations\u00a0(Aesth: 54).\n\n\nIn effect, this is a form of linguistic phenomenalism, and commits\nBeardsley to adequate translations of statements about aesthetic\nobjects into statements about the presentations of such\nobjects\u2014in effect, statements about experiences of such objects.\nAs linguistic phenomenalism as a general ontology\u2014or surrogate\nfor ontology\u2014has met with very strong criticism over the years,\nBeardsley\u2019s ontology would have problems enough if it stopped\nhere.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t. Not satisfied, Beardsley presses on to\ndistinguish\n\nthe artifact\u2014the play itself, say, as written\ndown\u2014from\na particular production of it\u2014the Old Vic\u2019s\nproduction, as opposed to the Marquette University theater\ndepartment\u2019s production\u2014from\na particular performance of it\u2014last night\u2019s\nperformance in the Helfaer Theater\u2014from\na particular presentation of it\u2014the play as it shows up in\nPeter Alelyunas\u2019s experience of it, upon attending last\nnight\u2019s performance.\n\n\nThe same distinctions hold across the arts, though differently in\ndifferent arts, and somewhat more naturally in some than others. There\nis Beethoven\u2019s D Minor Symphony (the artifact), a\nproduction of it (The Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra\u2019s\nrecording of it), a particular performance of it (my playing the\nrecording last night, in my house), and particular presentations of it\n(mine and other people\u2019s experiences of it last night, in my\nhouse). At least in many arts, a single artifact can have many\nproductions; a single production can have many performances; and a\nsingle performance can give rise to many presentations. As Beardsley\nnotes, these distinctions collapse to some extent in some of the arts,\nand would have to be stretched a bit to fit them all. In reading a\npoem silently, he says, the production is the presentation (and I\nwould also think the performance); \u201cin architecture, the\narchitect\u2019s plans are the artifact; the completed building is\nthe production\u201d (Aesth: 57\u201358) (and also\npresumably the performance); and in painting and sculpture, \u201cthe\ndistinction between artifact and production almost disappears\u201d\n(Aesth: 58) (with the performance presumably being identical\nwith both).\n\nBut what is the aesthetic object, the object of critical attention?\nIt\u2019s not a presentation or class of presentations, and\nit\u2019s not the artifact\u2014Beethoven\u2019s 9th\nSymphony, for example. If the aesthetic object were the artifact,\nit would have contradictory characteristics, since different\nrecordings of the 9th have different, incompatible\ncharacteristics: some are shorter than 60 minutes long, some longer.\nWhat\u2019s left, and what the aesthetic object must be, is the\nproduction. Thus the primary object of critical attention is the\nproduction of an artifact, and the basic job of the critic is to\ndescribe, interpret, and evaluate such productions.\n\nWhile interesting, original, and elegant, this position has its\nproblems. Difficulties with carrying out the translation program that\nBeardsley is committed to aside, linguistic phenomenalism is little\nmore than an attempt to enjoy the benefits of a reductive, sense-data\nontology without paying the price for it. Reductive translations have\ncommitments; there would be little point in proposing and defending an\nelaborate, difficult, counterintuitive, and otherwise inexplicable\ntranslation program, even in schematic form, unless it had some point\nbeyond translation for the sake of translation. There\u2019s either\nan ontology and a philosophical purpose behind such\ntranslations\u2014and there certainly seems to be both (an adequate\nreductive translation of \u2018p\u2019 as\n\u2018q\u2019 entails commitment only to the entities\nmentioned in \u2018q\u2019)\u2014or there is not\u2014in\nwhich case the possibility of such translations may be of interest to\nlinguists and those who like odd parlor games\u00a0but no one else. In\nshort, arguing that one can, in principle, avoid speaking of one sort\nof entity in favor of another is indirect ontology if it\u2019s\nphilosophy at all, and avoiding taking an explicit stand on ontology\ndoesn\u2019t change the fact. Beardsley would thus seem to be\ncommitted to phenomenalism, despite his explicit claim that aesthetic\nobjects aren\u2019t presentations.\n\nBut presentations are ill-suited objects of critical attention in any\ncase. They\u2019re too numerous and variable to ground objective\ncriticism, and thus too unwieldy to make criticism of any kind worth\nthe effort. In addition, taking aesthetic objects to be presentations\nconflicts with much of the practice\u2014that is, many of the\nremarks\u2014of critics themselves. None of this would be news to\nBeardsley\u2014he says as much himself in several places\u2014but it\ndoes mean that he shouldn\u2019t have walked down the phenomenalist\nroad as far as he did.\n\nPhenomenalism, even in linguistic dress, also conflicts with\nidentifying aesthetic objects with productions, since in a great many\ncases the production of an aesthetic object isn\u2019t the same thing\nas a presentation of it. But even if phenomenalism is put to the side\nand Beardsley is simply taken at his word, and aesthetic objects are\nidentified with productions, there are still anomalies. The first and\nmost important is that the ontological status of aesthetic objects\nwould be variable to the point of being of little philosophical\ninterest. A production of a novel, if read silently, is something\nmental, a series of thoughts, perhaps conjoined with images. The\nproduction of a play or symphony, however, isn\u2019t mental at all,\nbut a publicly accessible event or process. It thus has whatever\nontological status events or processes do. In architecture, the\nproduction is a building (or a bridge or a walkway), and thus a\nphysical object (or a cultural object, with physical properties, some\nwould say). Such wide variability suggests that there\u2019s no real\nontology of art at all, nothing firm, finite, or systematically\nrelated enough among the arts to be worth taking note of. A second\nproblem with taking aesthetic objects to be productions is that, since\nsome aesthetic objects are mental objects, the problems with\nphenomenalism noted at the end of the last paragraph reemerge in at\nleast some cases, literature among them. A third problem, one in\neffect already noted, is that even within one art\u00a0aesthetic\nobjects would have a shifting ontological status. In the case of\npoetry, for example, if a poem is read silently, the production, and\nthus the aesthetic object, is a mental thing, but if the same poem is\nread publicly, to an audience, the production, and thus the aesthetic\nobject, is an event.\n\nBy themselves, these objections don't refute Beardsley\u2019s views\non the ontology of art. What they show is the price that has to be\npaid for them. Perhaps alternative views offer less insight, or\nperhaps they offer more insight but at a higher cost, that is,\ngenerate more or even greater anomalies. Beardsley\u2019s views might\nstill be the best, all things considered. If so, the moral to be drawn\nmay be that the ontology of art isn\u2019t a very fruitful or\nimportant area of philosophical investigation, and that no harm to\nphilosophy or art criticism is done by ignoring it.\n4. Art as Essentially Institutional\n\nOne view that Beardsley certainly did think unacceptable, even if, as\nhe later came to realize, his own early position wouldn\u2019t do, is\nthat works of art are \u201cessentially institutional\u201d.\nDepending on the context, this could be a claim either about the\ndefinition of \u201cart\u201d or about the ontology of art.\nBeardsley rejects both claims, but it\u2019s important to distinguish\nthem.\n\nIn speaking of money as \u201cessentially institutional\u201d, a\nperson is probably claiming no more than that the definition or truth\nconditions of \u201cthis is money\u201d include a reference to\nsocial institutions. The claim isn\u2019t that quarters, dimes,\nnickels, and so on fall under a distinct ontological category other\nthan physical objects, namely, cultural or institutional objects.\n\nIf taken ontologically, on the other hand, the force of the claim is\nthat a work of art isn\u2019t a physical object but a different kind\nof object altogether, an object whose nature and existence are in part\nconstituted by culture, tradition, or social institutions. Arthur\nDanto\u2019s distinction between artworks and \u201cmere real\nthings\u201d(1981, 1), with beds and ties being paradigms of mere\nreal things, suggests just such an ontological distinction. For Danto,\nit\u2019s (1) theories of art and (2) the \u201caboutness\u201d of\nart, or the fact that art is necessarily subject to interpretation,\nthat make mere real things transform, so to speak, into artworks, and\ngain a new ontological status. The nature of a theory of art is never\nspelled out by Danto, but apparently all such theories require an\nobject to be properly placed in an \u201cartworld\u201d to be a work\nof art, and not just anyone, at any time, can do such placing. But\neven if the indefinite and unexplained nature of Danto\u2019s key\nconcepts is put aside, and the fact that many works of art (for\nexample, a typical concerto) don\u2019t seem to be about anything at\nall, or subject to interpretation in any significant sense (at least\nuntil something for it to be about or interpreted in terms of is\ncooked up, such as that it\u2019s about the very notes being played,\nor that it comments on the history of concertos)\u2014even if\nthat\u2019s also put aside, it\u2019s hard to see how (1) and (2)\ncan effect ontological transformations, how things which are otherwise\nphysical objects become, ontologically speaking, different objects.\nRather, Beardsley thinks, what (1) and (2) suggest is that if a\nphysical object is a work of art, it has, or at least can have,\nproperties it wouldn\u2019t otherwise have. If a person\u2019s a\npoliceman, he has properties\u2014being able to arrest people, for\nexample\u2014that he wouldn\u2019t otherwise have, but a policeman\nhas whatever ontological status a person has, no more and no less.\nReceiving a certificate from the police academy and putting on a badge\nmay \u201ctransform\u201d a man, but a new object, an essentially\ninstitutional or cultural object, a policeman, doesn\u2019t enter the\nworld because of such doings. The argument that works of art are\ncultural objects, not physical objects, because the former have\nproperties the latter don\u2019t, is thus rejected by Beardsley.\n5. Physical Objects and Kinds\n\nAlthough Beardsley\u2019s early views on ontology tended to either\nlinguistic phenomenalism or unsystematic pluralism, there were hints,\neven at that time, of a simpler and more commonsensical view. That\nontology can be seen lurking beneath the surface of his postulates of\nart criticism:\n\nThe aesthetic object is a perceptual object; that is, it can have\npresentations.\nPresentations of the same aesthetic object may occur at different\ntimes and to different people.\nTwo presentations of the same aesthetic object may differ from\neach other.\nThe characteristics of an aesthetic object may not be exhaustively\nrevealed in any particular presentation of it.\nA presentation may be veridical; that is, the characteristics of\nthe presentation may correspond to the characteristics of the\naesthetic object.\nA presentation may be illusory; that is, some of the\ncharacteristics of the presentation may fail to correspond to the\ncharacteristics of the aesthetic object.\nIf two presentations of the same aesthetic object have\nincompatible characteristics, at least one of them is illusory.\n(Aesth: 46, 48)\n\n\nTaking \u201caesthetic object\u201d to mean \u201cwork of\nart\u201d, the underlying ontology isn\u2019t a sense-datum ontology\nor a mixed-category ontology at all. Several of the\npostulates\u20142, 4, and 6; possibly 3 and 7\u2014are in fact\nprima facie incompatible with a sense-datum ontology. Rather,\nwhat 1\u20137 strongly suggest is that a work of art is a physical\nobject: it\u2019s perceptible, publicly or inter-subjectively\navailable in both time and space, can appear differently from\ndifferent points of view and at different times, may not be\nexhaustively understood on any given occasion, has properties that may\nbe correctly or incorrectly perceived, and is such that attributions\nto it obey the law of non-contradiction.\n\nNot surprisingly, after 1958 Beardsley\n\n\nmoved steadily in the direction of some form of non-reductive\nmaterialism, of seeing how far it is possible to go in treating\nartworks as physical objects.\u00a0(Aesth: xxiv)\n\n\nThe materialism is non-reductive\u00a0in that works of art have\nproperties that physical objects generally don\u2019t. Such\nmaterialism works well with \u201csingular\u201d works of art, such\nas paintings, Beardsley thinks, but \u201cmultiple\nartworks\u201d\u2014musical compositions which have many\nperformances, poems which exist in multiple printings\u2014present\nproblems. The musical composition isn\u2019t any single score or\nperformance, the poem any single printed text. For that reason,\nBeardsley once again is driven back in the direction of ontological\npluralism: perhaps works of art are either physical objects (the\nsingular works) or kinds of physical object (the multiple works), with\n\u201cphysical object\u201d construed broadly here so as to include\nevents (such as a dance). This position is only slightly more\neconomical than Beardsley\u2019s earlier one\u2014no works of art\nare ideas, which is good, since taking works of art to be ideas\ndoesn\u2019t fit in well with a number of his critical\npostulates\u2014and only slightly tidier\u2014essentially, the\nproliferation of ontological categories is limited by the broad but\nabstract concept of a kind.\n\nMost philosophers would be dissatisfied with such a disjoint ontology,\nand Beardsley was no exception. There are basically two ways to avoid\nit:\n\nsubsume physical objects under kinds;\nsubsume kinds under physical objects.\n\n\n(A third possibility is to subsume both under a broader, inclusive\ncategory. Absent a relatively revisionist ontology, however,\nit\u2019s hard to see what such a third category would be.) Both\nstrategies involve assigning primacy to one of the categories, but\neach requires that that be done in a way that does justice to what we\nsay and think about art.\n\nThe first proposal, to subsume physical objects under kinds, entails\nthat the Mona Lisa isn\u2019t a physical object but a kind\nof painting. One difficulty with this is that as a kind, the Mona\nLisa wouldn\u2019t have any perceptual properties, which is both\nstrange and in violation of Beardsley\u2019s critical postulates. A\nsecond difficulty is that it\u2019s a necessary truth\u2014or at\nleast many philosophers think it\u2019s a necessary truth\u2014that\nthere\u2019s only one Mona Lisa, yet the view in question\nentails that there could be many Mona Lisas, many instances\nof the kind.\n\nNeither objection is definitive, however. Although Beardsley discusses\nneither objection, the first can be deflated by noting that although,\nstrictly speaking, the Mona Lisa is a kind, it has perceptual\nproperties in that all of its instances do. In other words, since all\ninstances of the kind have perceptual properties, instances-of-a-kind\nare near enough to kinds to allow kinds to have perceptual properties\nin an extended sense of the term, by a small conceptual courtesy.\nThat\u2019s close enough for government work (as the saying goes).\nEven if this response is acceptable, however, the question of what the\nperceptual properties of the Mona Lisa are, if two of its\ninstances differ markedly in their perceptual properties (due, say, to\nexposure to sunlight), would remain an odd one. Not an unanswerable\none, however. That question and others like it could be answered by\ntaking the Mona Lisa to be, in effect, an etching, with the\nfirst of its instances as a reference point for others.\n\nThat reply, in fact, previews a response to the second objection.\nPerhaps it\u2019s simply a contingent, historical fact that we\ncan\u2019t create extremely accurate duplicates of paintings, and for\nthat reason attach great importance to first instances of\npainting-kinds. That may be why we\u2019re very reluctant to\nadmit\u2014reluctant to the point of thinking it\nimpossible\u2014that there could be more than one Mona\nLisa.\n\nEven if both objections can be rebutted, though, Beardsley is still\ninclined to reject the view that works of art are, all of them,\nkinds.\n\nHe\u2019s also inclined to reject the second view, that works of art\nare, all of them, physical objects. Though the topic isn\u2019t\npursued at length, his reasons center around the fact that many works\nof art\u2014woodcuts, for instance\u2014have multiple instances, and\nit\u2019s impossible to account for that fact if every work of art is\na physical object. Is Pastijn\u2019s The Last Supper in Rome\nor in Paris? If it\u2019s a physical object, it can\u2019t be in\nboth places, so which of the two is it? Since both \u201cParis\u201d\nand \u201cRome\u201d seem wrong, the correct thing to do is to\nreject the assumption that the woodcut is a physical object. Rather,\nit\u2019s a kind, and has instances that are located in Paris and\nRome.\n\nBut if that\u2019s enough to quell doubts about some works of art\nbeing kinds, it should also be enough, for the reasons mentioned two\nand three paragraphs back, to quell doubts about all works of art\nbeing kinds. The remaining barrier to the first reductive view, that\nworks of art are, all of them, kinds, would then be removed.\n\nOn the other hand, the overall argument could just as easily cut the\nother way. If it\u2019s physical objects that literally have\nperceptual properties, then why not take works of art, all of them, to\nbe physical objects, with kinds being granted the title in an extended\nsense of the term, by a small conceptual courtesy? As traditionally\ninterpreted, Aristotle holds that in the primary sense a substance is\nan individual, but in a secondary sense, by extension, a species is\nalso a substance. Why not say something similar about works of art?\nWhy not say, that, strictly speaking, works of art are physical\nobjects, but in a secondary sense, works of art are kinds?\n\nBeardsley doesn\u2019t pursue the issue to the lengths that it has\nbeen here, so it\u2019s impossible to know how he\u2019d respond to\nthe above. On the record, though, he embraces the untidy pluralism\nhe\u2019d rather avoid. Doing so doesn\u2019t especially bother him,\nhowever, as he doesn\u2019t think ontological questions as important\nas many other questions in aesthetics. \n6. The Definition of Art\n\nAs mentioned above, Beardsley \u201csedulously avoided\u201d\n(Aesth: 59) the term \u201cwork of art\u201d as much as\npossible in Aesthetics. Even so, he came close to defining\nit. \u201cAesthetic object\u201d is his surrogate term, and he does\noffer a schematic definition of it.\n\nThe genus of \u201caesthetic object\u201d is perceptual\nobject. What is its differentia? It\u2019s not, Beardsley\nargues,\n\na motive or intention, even an aesthetic motive or intention, that\nstands behind the creation of the object,\nan effect, even if an aesthetic effect, that the object produces\nin those who experience it, or\nan attitude, even if, again, an aesthetic attitude, that people\nbring to the object.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is\u00a0objective differentia, not subjective ones\nlike (a), (b), and (c). Such differentia could be of either of two\nsorts. First, it could express the characteristics of perceptual\nobjects that all and only aesthetic objects have. This, Beardsley\nthinks, can\u2019t be done until a great deal of knowledge of\naesthetic objects and the philosophy of art is at hand; and it\nisn\u2019t. Second, an objective definition could proceed by first\ndividing up aesthetic objects into classes according to their sensory\nfields\u2014as seen, heard, felt, and so on\u2014and then, within\neach field, determining what objective characteristics distinguish\naesthetic objects from other perceptual objects.\n\nThe second route is the one Beardsley takes in Aesthetics.\nSchematically, an aesthetic object is: a visual perceptual object that\nisn\u2019t in the class of things that plastic forks, crumpled pieces\nof paper, and so on are in; or an auditory perceptual object that\nisn\u2019t in the class of objects that scratches, noises, and so on\nare in; etc. This is more the beginnings of an outline of an approach\nto a definition than the beginnings of a definition\nitself\u2014something Beardsley realizes\u2014and it has problems of\nits own. The interesting question, however, isn\u2019t what those\nproblems are or the ultimate success or failure of this \u201cdivide\nand conquer\u201d approach, but why he adopted it in the first place,\nand why he later abandoned it.\n\nHe adopted it for two reasons. First, approaches of the (a), (b), and\n(c) sort have numerous and serious problems (Aesth:\n60\u201363). Second, if art criticism can amount to knowledge, as\nBeardsley believes it can, then what\u2019s called for is an object\nof study that can be examined in its own right, in respect to its own\nobjective qualities. Both of these factors led him in search of an\nobjective definition of \u201caesthetic object\u201d. Since,\nhowever, identifying necessary and sufficient conditions seemed out of\nthe question\u2014there was too much variety among aesthetic objects,\nand too much disagreement among philosophers\u2014\u201cdivide and\nconquer\u201d seemed a better strategy.\n\nThe reason why he later abandoned it is that he came to realize not\nonly that his objections to an (a)-type definition weren\u2019t\ndefinitive, but that there\u2019s much to be said for an\nintentionalistic definition, a definition couched in terms of the\nartist\u2019s intention.\n7. Against Institutional Definitions\n\nBefore he arrived at that view, though, he spent some time arguing\nagainst a popular definition proposed by George Dickie. According to\nDickie,\n\n\na work of art in the classificatory sense is (1) an artifact, (2) a\nset of aspects of which has had conferred upon it the status of\ncandidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting on behalf\nof a certain social institution (the artworld). (Dickie 1974, 34)\n\n\nBeardsley has no quarrel with (1), but he finds fault with (2) on\nseveral counts.\n\nFirst, he wonders whether the \u201cappreciation\u201d spoken of can\nbe any sort of appreciation at all\u2014historical, moral, personal,\nprofessional, or whatever. If it can, the definition is far too broad.\nPerhaps, though, it\u2019s distinctly aesthetic appreciation\nthat\u2019s meant. In that case, Dickie would have to square his\nsecond condition with his attack on the idea of aesthetic appreciation\nas a distinct sort or kind of appreciation.\n\nSecond, the idea of candidacy for appreciation is problematic. A\ncandidate for appreciation can\u2019t be merely something, some\nproperty (or aspect), that\u2019s potentially appreciable. Too many\nproperties of too many things are potentially appreciable. If\n\u201ccandidacy\u201d is interpreted more narrowly and strictly,\nhowever, the idea that a property needs a status like \u201ccandidate\nfor appreciation\u201d bestowed upon it seems wrongheaded. A\ncandidate for President of the United States, for example, isn\u2019t\njust anyone who\u2019s eligible\u00a0but someone who has taken at\nleast some steps toward attaining that office, or someone who has had\nan official endorsement. But what\u2019s comparable in the case of\naspects of works of art?\n\n\nWhat sort of preparation or endorsement is contained in the assignment\nof candidacy for appreciation? The term suggests that something cannot\nbe appreciated until it has been declared a candidate for\nappreciation.\u00a0(APV: 133)\n\n\nbut being appreciated, or even appreciable, stands in need of no\none\u2019s imprimatur.\n\nThird, there\u2019s the question of who confers the status of\ncandidate for appreciation. Dickie\u2019s explicit answer is\n\u201csome person or acting on behalf of a certain social institution\n(the artworld)\u201d, with the artworld itself being\n\n\na bundle of systems: theater, painting, sculpture, literature, music,\nand so on, each of which furnishes an institutional background for the\nconferring of the status on objects within its domain\u00a0(Dickie\n1974, 33).\n\n\nIn calling the artworld an institution, Dickie says, he\u2019s saying\nthat \u201cit is an established practice\u201d (1974, 31). Music,\npainting, literature, and so on are social practices.\n\nBeardsley will have none of this. What it is to act on behalf of an\ninstitution is clear enough when an identifiable social institution,\nsuch as a university, is in question. The president of Marquette\nUniversity, for example, declares a tuition hike, or signs a document\ngranting tenure to David Decker. He acts on behalf of the institution\nin doing so, because there are clearly defined rules, roles, rights,\nresponsibilities, powers, positions, concepts, and acts that\nconstitute the institution that is the university, and he fits into it\nin a way that enables him to raise tuition, or to confer the status of\ntenured professor. There\u2019s nothing remotely comparable in\n\u201cthe artworld\u201d\u2014no formal, identifiable set of\ninterlocking rules, roles, relations, and so on constituting an\ninstitution, and so nothing like an institutional token (comparable to\nMarquette University or the Department of the Treasury) with empowered\nindividuals capable of conferring the status of painting, literature,\nor music on objects. What there are are loose collections of people of\nvarious sorts interested in painting, music, and literature. The same\nis true of gardening and cooking, however, and roses and veal cutlets\nneed no social institutions, no \u201cgardenworlds\u201d or\n\u201cfoodworlds\u201d, to be what they are. Neither, Beardsley\nthinks, do paintings, poems, or concertos need social institutions,\nsubdivisions of the \u201cartworld\u201d, to be what they are.\nMuseums, books of poetry, academies of music, and journals of art\ncriticism exist because of a felt need to accommodate, promote,\nexplore, and otherwise reap the benefits of pre-existing, logically\nprior objects known as works of art. And as for practices,\n\n\nDoes it make any sense to speak of acting on behalf of a\npractice? Status-awarding authority can center in an\ninstitutional token, but practices, as such, seem to lack the\nrequisite source of authority. Perhaps the artworld, as Dickie\nconceives it, could not confer status.\u00a0(APV: 134)\n\n\nLast, and independent of the other objections, there is the problem of\ncircularity. Works of art are defined in terms of the artworld; the\nartworld consists of people who have some sort of special doings with\nworks of art. Ultimately, art is defined in terms of itself. To the\nresponse to this\u2014basically, Dickie\u2019s\u2014that the circle\nis large enough to make the definition interesting and informative,\nBeardsley shakes his head in dismay: if works of art are\n\n\nultimately defined in terms of themselves, some important piece of the\ntruth must not have been encompassed in the circle.\u00a0(APV:\n134)\n\n\nAlthough some of these objections apply to Dickie alone, most,\nBeardsley thinks, apply in one form or another to every institutional\ndefinition of art.\n8. A Neo-Romantic Definition\n\nHis own preferred view is neo-Romantic and\nintentionalistic\u2014perhaps surprisingly, since Beardsley opposes\nRomanticism and intentionalism in the philosophy of art on every other\nfront. A work of art is defined as\n\n\neither an arrangement of conditions intended to be capable of\naffording an experience with marked aesthetic character or\n(incidentally) an arrangement belonging to a class or type of\narrangements that is typically intended to have this capacity. (APV:\n299)\n\n\nThe first disjunct is the more important one; it says that\nsomething\u2019s a work if it\u2019s an artifact, \u201can\narrangement of conditions\u201d, that was intended by its creator to\nbe capable of providing an experience with non-negligible aesthetic\ncharacter. It\u2019s important to realize what\u2019s not being said\nhere. First, the definition doesn\u2019t say that a work of art is\nintended to provide (or be capable of providing) a full-blown\naesthetic experience. Only \u201can experience with marked aesthetic\ncharacter\u201d is required. Second, the definition doesn\u2019t say\nthat a work of art doesn\u2019t or can\u2019t have a utilitarian\nfunction, in the everyday sense of the term. A work of art could be a\nchair that\u2019s many times simply sat in, for example. Third, the\ndefinition doesn\u2019t say that the primary intention behind the\ncreation of the artifact is an aesthetic one. The primary intention\nbehind the creation of a religious icon, for example, could be to\nbring worshipers closer to God. What makes such an icon a work of art,\nhowever, is not that intention\u00a0but another one: the\nintention that it be capable of affording viewers an experience with\nmarked aesthetic character. How marked this character must be\nisn\u2019t specified, but that may be all to the good. As the exact\nextension of \u201cwork of art\u201d is somewhat indefinite, so is\nthe extension of \u201cartifact created with the intention of being\ncapable of affording an experience with marked aesthetic\ncharacter\u201d. If the extensions of the two are the same or very\nnearly so, and the objects in the \u201cgray areas\u201d, the areas\nnot definitely within or without the extension of the two, are also\nthe same or very nearly so, then so much the better for the\ndefinition.\n\nThe second part of the definition picks up those objects that\ndefinitely are works of art\u00a0but were created in a mechanical,\nalmost an assembly-line fashion, or as just another instance of its\nkind. Some beautiful vases may fall into the first class, and many\nmedieval icons into the second. To make sure that the extension of the\ndefiniens matches that of the definiendum, the\nsecond disjunct of the definition is needed.\n\nWhy accept the definition? For several reasons, Beardsley thinks.\nFirst, a definition\n\n\nchosen for a role in aesthetic theory should mark a distinction that\nis\u2026 significant for aesthetic theory\u00a0(APV: 299),\n\n\nand Beardsley\u2019s does. Second,\n\n\nin selecting key terms for aesthetic theory we ought to stay as close\nas convenient to ordinary use\u00a0(APV: 300).\n\n\nNot everyone\u2019s use of a term needs to be captured in fashioning\na definition, which would be impossible in any case with a term as\nelastic and tendentiously used as \u201cwork of art\u201d.\nBeardsley\u2019s definition has the merit of capturing\n\n\nreasonably well a use that has been prominent for some centuries and\nstill persists quite widely today, outside the speech and writing of\nor about the avant-garde. (APV: 300)\n\n\nIn other words, Beardsley\u2019s definition captures the ordinary\nextension of a term. The fact that it may not capture the extension of\na term as used by the avant-garde\u2014who may claim that Waltina\nWeber\u2019s arthritis is a work of art\u2014doesn\u2019t count\nagainst it to any appreciable extent. Third, a definition of\n\u201cwork of art\u201d\n\n\nshould be of the greatest possible utility to inquirers in other\nfields besides aesthetics\u2014fields to which aesthetics itself\nshould (sometimes) be thought of as a support and underpinning. (APV:\n304)\n\n\nThe fields Beardsley has in mind, more than any other, are art history\nand anthropology. Fourth and last, a definition of \u201cwork of\nart\u201d should \u201cconceptually link\u2026 art and the\naesthetic\u201d (APV: 312). That Beardsley\u2019s does in spades,\ndirectly defining art in terms of the aesthetic as it does.\n\nWhat can be said against the definition? Complaints could come from\nany number of quarters, but most would focus on its being too narrow.\nThe definition simply doesn\u2019t get the extension of \u201cwork\nof art\u201d right, it would be argued, because of its antiquated\nfocus on the aesthetic. Developments in art, art criticism, and the\nphilosophy of art in the twentieth century have shown the independence\nof art and the aesthetic, with the result being a\nmarked divergence in their extensions. Pieces of driftwood and stones,\nfor example, have been displayed in museums and catalogued as works of\nart. Artifactuality thus isn\u2019t a necessary condition of art. And\nmany objects obviously have no aesthetic intention behind them, and\nyet are works of art. Duchamp\u2019s famous Fountain, for\nexample, a urinal turned upside down, is a work of art, but it was\nmanufactured in a factory. No aesthetic intention stands behind it, it\nhas no aesthetically interesting properties, and it doesn\u2019t\nbelong to a kind whose members are normally created with an aesthetic\nintention. Literally thousands of objects of the same sort can be\nfound in museums and galleries today. They\u2019re listed in museum\ncatalogues, discussed in art history texts, and analyzed in journals\nof art criticism. If they aren\u2019t works of art, what are\nthey?\n\nBeardsley never explicitly responded to this objection, but he\nwouldn\u2019t be fazed. The objection assumes that if an object is\ndisplayed in a museum\u2014a fine arts museum, not a history museum\nor any other sort of museum\u2014or if an art historian or art critic\ndiscusses an object, then it must be a work of art, or at least that\nthere\u2019s very strong reason to think that it\u2019s a work of\nart. That it\u2019s some reason to think so Beardsley wouldn\u2019t\ndeny; but that it\u2019s necessarily a strong or definitive reason he\ncertainly would. Fine arts museums sometimes display the working\nclothes or palettes of artists, but they aren\u2019t works of art.\nThis has to do with the fact that even if the primary business of a\nmuseum is to display art, it has other functions as well,\u00a0and\njustifiably extends its mission in various ways. Palettes and working\nclothes are an extension in one direction, for one reason, but pieces\nof driftwood and stones are a different extension, in a different\ndirection, and for a different reason. They\u2019re\ndisplayed\u2014in small numbers\u2014because they\u2019re\naesthetically interesting, just as most works of art are. And\nDuchamp\u2019s Fountain might be displayed not because\nit\u2019s a work of art\u2014although presenting an upside\ndown urinal to a museum might be regarded as a small joke, and thus a\nminor work of art\u2014but because (a) art, as a human endeavor, has\na history, (b) museums, as a social institution, have a duty to\nacknowledge and exhibit that history, and (c) Fountain, as a\nwell-chosen memorial to the joke, has a place in that history. Much\nthe same can be said about the remarks of art critics and art\nhistorians respecting Fountain and its many kin. If such\nobjects are called \u201cworks of art\u201d for a long enough period\nof time, by a large enough group of people, the term can easily\nacquire a secondary sense or a number of derivative senses. Beardsley\nis probably alluding to as much in his remarks about the use of the\nterm by or about the avant-garde. But that the appearance of\ncoatracks, old shoes, broken sticks, and such like in museums, or that\nmention of them in books and journals by art critics and historians\nmeans that \u201cart\u201d in the primary sense is wrongly defined\nin terms of artifactuality and aesthetic intention\u2014that\nhasn\u2019t been shown, he would say. A perfectly good explanation of\nsuch phenomena can be provided in accord with a relatively traditional\ndefinition of art.\n9. The Intentions of the Artist\n\nDespite his many books and articles, Beardsley is probably best known\nfor his very first article in aesthetics. In \u201cThe Intentional\nFallacy\u201d, a paper co-written with William K. Wimsatt and\npublished in 1946, he argued against the neo-Romantic view that a work\nof art means what the artist says it means, or what he intends it to\nmean. Since many pens have run dry in writing about\u2014and in the\ngreat majority of cases attacking\u2014The Intentional Fallacy,\nanother pen will run dry in discussing it below.\n\nThe issue can be put in terms of the relation between\n\n(1)\nThe artist intended x to mean p in work\nw\n\n\nand\n\n(2)\nx means p in work w.\n\n\nAccording to E.D. Hirsch,\n (1)\n entails\n (2),\n at least if w is a literary work, because the meaning of\n\u2018x\u2019 simply is what the writer meant or intended\nby \u2018x\u2019. Knowing the artist\u2019s intention is\nthus knowing the work\u2019s meaning (Hirsch 1967). That\u2019s one\nend of the spectrum on the relation between\n (1)\n and\n (2).\n\nBeardsley sits at the other end. He holds that the intentions of the\nartist aren\u2019t relevant to the interpretation of a work of art at\nall.\n (1)\n not only doesn\u2019t entail\n (2);\n in and of itself, it provides no direct evidential support for\n (2).\n An artist\u2019s intentions have nothing to do with what a work\nmeans.\n\nBetween Beardsley and Hirsch are any number of intermediate positions,\nin general characterizable as holding that the intentions of the\nartist provide some direct evidential support for\n (2)\u00a0but\n not definitive support. Artists\u2019 intentions have some weight,\nin other words, but not, as Hirsch in effect has it, infinite weight,\nweight that entails that the work means what the artist intends it to\nmean. Other factors may well outweigh that of the artist\u2019s\nintention in a particular case, and the meaning of the work, or part\nof the work, not correspond to what the artist intends. Many\nphilosophers, probably the majority, would subscribe to such an\nintermediate position. The question, however, isn\u2019t which\nposition is most popular, but which has the most to say for it.\n\nOne steadfast conviction of Beardsley\u2019s is that his does. He\nreturned to the issue of the relation of intention and interpretation\na number of times, and never wavered. In fact, he was more than\nconsistent on the issue; he also held that\n\n(3)\nThe artist intended w to have descriptive property\np\n\n\nprovides no direct evidential support for\n\n(4)\nW has descriptive property p,\n\n\nand that\n\n(5)\nThe artist intended w to have evaluative property\ne\n\n\nprovides no direct evidential support for\n\n(6)\nW has evaluative property e.\n\n\nAn artist\u2019s intentions are utterly irrelevant to the\ndescriptive, interpretive, and evaluative properties of his work. If\nwe want to know what properties a work has, we should examine the\nwork, not the worker.\n\nAnd in addition to \u201cThe Intentional Fallacy\u201d,\nthere\u2019s also the lesser known and lesser discussed \u201cThe\nAffective Fallacy\u201d. In a paper bearing that name (1949), also\nco-written with William Wimsatt, Beardsley argued that a\nperson\u2019s affective responses to a work of art are irrelevant to\nits descriptive, interpretive, and evaluative properties. If we want\nto know what properties a work has, we should look at the work, not\nthose looking at the work.\n\nBeardsley\u2019s claims about the irrelevance of the artist\u2019s\nintentions to the descriptive and evaluative properties of his work\nhave elicited little in the way of critical response. That may or may\nnot mean that philosophers are generally in agreement with him. As far\nas the irrelevance of the artist\u2019s intentions to interpretation\nis concerned, however, there has been a great deal of dissent. Since\nthere has, what follows will concentrate exclusively upon\ninterpretation.\n\nBeardsley\u2019s arguments against intentionalism are of a variety of\nsorts. In \u201cThe Intentional Fallacy\u201d, he says that the\nintentions of the artist are neither \u201cavailable nor\ndesirable\u201d, with this meaning that such intentions aren\u2019t\nalways available and are never desirable. Since we frequently can and\ndo correctly interpret a work of art with little or no knowledge about\nthe artist, the fact that the artist\u2019s intentions aren\u2019t\nalways available is enough to show that Hirsch\u2019s position is\nwrong. But that it\u2019s never desirable to consult the\nartist\u2019s intentions when they\u2019re available is what\nBeardsley has to prove.\n\nPartial support can be found in his argument that\n\n\nJudging a poem is like judging a pudding or a machine. One demands\nthat it work. It is only because an artifact works that we infer the\nintention of the artificer\u2026. A poem can be only\nthrough its meaning\u2026 yet it is, simply\nis, in the sense that we have no excuse for inquiring what\npart is intended or meant. (IF: 469)\n\n\nIn other words, a poem or other work of art is independent of its\ncreator, just as any other artifact\u2014a pudding or a washing\nmachine\u2014is. A pudding consists of milk, eggs, and other\ningredients; a washing machine of a metal drum, rubber gaskets, and\nother parts; and a poem of words. In all three cases, the parts exist\nand are what they are independently of the artificers, and the\nartifacts are to be judged\u2014and interpreted\u2014on the basis of\ntheir properties. There\u2019s no need to bring in the artificer, for\nhe doesn\u2019t remain behind in the parts, and critical judgment,\nincluding interpretation, concerns the how, why, what, and how well of\nthe artifact, not the how, why, what, or how well of the artificer.\nThe proof of the pudding is in the eating, not the chef\u2019s\nintentions.\n\nThe principal point at which this argument\u2014admittedly, an\nextended reconstruction of a few remarks in \u201cThe Intentional\nFallacy\u201d\u2014might be questioned is in the assumption that\nworks of art are like standard, garden-variety artifacts\u2014lawn\nchairs and television sets\u2014in leaving their creators behind. For\nBeardsley, a work of art isn\u2019t fundamentally different from a\npair of fingernail clippers: it\u2019s made and then begins its own\nautonomous life. It is what it is\u2014who knows or cares who created\nit, and with what intentions. This is a plausible position, but not an\nunassailable\u00a0one. The alternative view is that not all artifacts\nlead autonomous lives, and that for some, works of art as well as, on\nmany people\u2019s view, linguistic artifacts of all kinds (sentence\ntokens, memos, book chapters, and so on), what they are is intimately\nlinked to their creator, and more particularly to the intention-laden\nconditions of their origin. Put more concretely and slightly too\nstrongly in terms of an imperfect analogy with physical objects: a\nrock isn\u2019t space, and to understand a rock we can many times can\nignore considerations of space, but if we remove space altogether from\nour understanding of a rock, there isn\u2019t a rock to understand at\nall. On this view, then, a proper understanding of works of\nart\u2014which includes correctly interpreting them\u2014requires\nthe admissibility of considerations of the artist\u2019s intentions,\neven if those intentions aren\u2019t always available or needed.\n\nBut why, Beardsley would ask in reply, are works of art so special?\nWhat makes them categorically different from your run-of-the-mill\nartifact? The view in question distinguishes kinds of artifact without\nproviding a principled or well-argued basis for doing so. At the\nleast, additional support is needed. Absent such support, the view is\nnothing but special pleading.\n\nOne possible reply is that there is a non-arbitrary difference between\nworks of art and other artifacts, namely\u00a0that other artifacts\naren\u2019t essentially meaning-laden and works of art are. Still, in\nand of itself, this isn\u2019t sufficient, Beardsley would say, for\n(i) some works of art, such as \u201cpure music\u201d, aren\u2019t\nmeaning-laden, (ii) many objects which aren\u2019t works of art, such\nas newspapers, are meaning-laden, and (iii) even if (i) and (ii)\nweren\u2019t true, the fact that all and only works of art are\nmeaning-laden has to be shown to make for the relevance of\nartists\u2019 intentions, and that hasn\u2019t been done.\n\nIn Aesthetics, the attack is a little different. \u201cWe\nmust distinguish between the aesthetic object and the intention in the\nmind of its creator\u201d, Beardsley says, and the irrelevance of the\nlatter to interpretation can be shown if we consider a certain\nsculpture, \u201ca large, twisted, cruller-shaped object of polished\nteak, mounted at an oblique angle to the floor\u201d. The creator of\nthe sculpture intends it to \u201csymbolize\u2026 Human\nDestiny\u201d. Try as we might, however, we \u201csee in it no such\nsymbolic meaning\u201d. The philosophical question then is:\n\n\nShould we say that we have simply missed the symbolism, but that it\nmust be there, since what a statue symbolizes is precisely what its\nmaker makes it symbolize? Or should we say, in the spirit of Alice\nconfronting the extreme semantic conventionalism [intentionalism] of\nHumpty Dumpty, that the question is whether that object can be made to\nmean Human Destiny?\n\n\nObviously, the latter, Beardsley thinks, for the former entails\nthat\n\n\nanyone can make anything symbolize anything just by saying it does,\nfor another sculpture could copy the same object and label it\n\u201cSpirit of Palm Beach, 1938\u201d. (Aesth:\n18\u201319, 21)\n\n\nThe argument here is fine as far as it goes, but it doesn\u2019t go\nas far as Beardsley apparently thinks it does. What it shows is that\nan artist\u2019s say-so or intention isn\u2019t absolute as far as\nthe meaning of his work is concerned. That\u2019s a far cry from\nshowing that\n (1)\n is utterly irrelevant to\n (2).\n\nIn addition to sculpture, the irrelevance of the author to the meaning\nof his text is also argued for by Beardsley, though only partly by\ncounterexample. \u201cSuppose someone utters a sentence\u201d, he\nsays.\n\n\nWe can [then] ask two questions: (1) What does the speaker\nmean? (2) What does the sentence mean?\n\n\nAlthough answers to the two questions usually coincide, they can\ndiverge; people can mean one thing and say another. The reason\nthat\u2019s possible is that\n\n\nwhat a sentence means depends not on the whim of the individual, and\nhis mental vagaries, but upon public conventions of usage that are\ntied up with habit patterns in the whole speaking community.\n\n\nSentence meaning\u2014that is, textual meaning\u2014is thus one\nthing, and is anchored in the \u201cthe whole speaking\ncommunity\u201d, while speaker meaning\u2014what the author\nmeant\u2014is quite another, and is anchored in his own, quite\npossibly idiosyncratic intentions. Thus an author can be wrong about\nwhat his own work means. A.E. Housman, for example, was probably wrong\nin claiming that his poem \u201c1887\u201d wasn\u2019t ironic\n(Aesth:, 25\u201326).\n\nOnce again, there\u2019s something wrong and something right in what\nBeardsley says. He\u2019s undoubtedly right that sentence meaning and\nspeaker meaning needn\u2019t coincide, and that that proves that the\ntwo aren\u2019t identical. Thus the author\u2019s intention\nisn\u2019t always the final word on what a text means. That, however,\ndoesn\u2019t prove that the author\u2019s intention carries no\nevidential weight at all. According to the alternative position, it\ndoes, but in some cases, perhaps the majority of them, not enough to\ncarry the day. In other cases, however, and perhaps Housman\u2019s\namong them, the author\u2019s intention can tip the scales in favor\nof one reading rather than another. In any case, the argument here\nmight conclude, the unease that many people feel in dismissing Housman\nfrom the interpretation of his poem argues that we should accord his\nintentions at least some weight.\n\nIn The Possibility of Criticism, three arguments are advanced\nagainst intentionalism, which is again taken to be the view that the\nmeaning of a work of art is what the artist intends it to mean. The\nfirst is that\n\n\nsome texts that have been formed without the agency of an author, and\nhence without authorial meaning, nevertheless have a meaning and can\nbe interpreted. (PC: 18)\n\n\nWhat Beardsley has in mind is the kind of verbal mistake made at a\npublishing house, or by a computer in scanning a document. He cites\nthe sentence \u201cJensen argued like a man filled with righteous\nindigestion\u201d as an example of a text that can be read and\ninterpreted, yet no agency, a fortiori no author\u2019s\nintention, stands behind it. \u201cIndignation\u201d became\n\u201cindigestion\u201d at the printer\u2019s, by mechanical\nerror.\n\nTrue enough, his opponent would say in reply, but what that shows is\nthat the author\u2019s intention isn\u2019t identical with the\nmeaning of a text or needed in all cases to correctly interpret a\ntext. What it doesn\u2019t show is that the author\u2019s intention,\nif present, is irrelevant to interpretation. Besides, the reply would\ncontinue, printer\u2019s errors and similar cases are parasitic on\nnormal cases in which there is authorial intent. Our conception of a\ntext is that of an intentionally created artifact of a certain kind,\nand cases in which authorial intent is altogether missing are admitted\nas texts only by conceptual courtesy, based on the similarity of such\ntexts to standard, intention-laden texts.\n\nThe second argument is that\n\n\nthe meaning of a text can change after its author has died. But the\nauthor cannot change his meaning after he has died. Therefore, textual\nmeaning is not identical to the authorial meaning.\n\n\nBolstering this argument is the fact that\n\n\nthe OED furnishes abundant evidence that individual words and idioms\nacquire new meanings and lose old meanings as time passes; these\nchanges can in turn produce changes of the meaning in sentences in\nwhich the words appear.\n\n\nAs an example, Beardsley cites a line from a poem written in 1744,\n\u201cHe raised his plastic arm\u201d, and notes that \u201cplastic\narm\u201d has \u201cacquired a new meaning in the twentieth\ncentury\u201d. Thus the line \u201cin which it occurs has also\nacquired a new meaning\u201d (PC: 19).\n\nThis argument is highly doubtful. Just as the doings of the homosexual\ncommunity in the 1970s, and the terminology that such doings\nintroduced, don\u2019t mean that the line \u201cNow we don our gay\napparel\u201d has acquired a new meaning in the Christmas carol, a\ncall to dressing in drag, so the doings of\u00a0the oil industry in\nthe twentieth century, and the terminology surrounding petrochemical\nproducts that such doings introduced, don\u2019t mean that the line\n\u201cHe raised his plastic arm\u201d has acquired a new meaning in\nthe poem, a meaning having to do with the movement of a prosthetic\nlimb. Newer meanings of a term, distant from original meanings and far\nremoved in time, are utterly irrelevant to the meaning of a line\nwritten long ago. In effect, the principle of interpretation\nunderlying Beardsley\u2019s argument, that new meanings of a term are\nrelevant to the interpretation of older texts in which it occurs,\n\nunderwrites unbridled anachronism,\nentails ever changing but correct interpretation\u2014that is, no\nstable textual meaning\u2014and\nseriously threatens the autonomy of the text and, by extension,\nthe autonomy of all works of art.\n\n\nAlthough Beardsley might regard (a) as an acceptable consequence of\nhis argument, at least if \u201cunbridled anachronism\u201d were\nreplaced with a less loaded term, he\u2019d undoubtedly be unhappy\nwith (b) and (c). (b) challenges the objectivity of criticism,\nsomething that he\u2019s at pains to establish, and (c) endangers his\ncomprehensive outlook on art and art criticism. Perhaps that\u2019s\nwhy he later seems to have renounced the argument, even if only\nimplicitly (cf. Aesth: li).\n\nThe third argument is the familiar one that\n\n\na text can have meanings that its author is not aware of. Therefore,\nit can have meanings that its author did not intend. Therefore,\ntextual meaning is not identical to authorial meaning. (PC: 20)\n\n\nWhile all this can be granted, Beardsley\u2019s critic would say, the\nlast sentence gives the game away: the argument doesn\u2019t show the\ncomplete irrelevance of the author\u2019s intentions to the meaning\nof his work, just that the two aren\u2019t identical.\n10. The Intentionalist Strikes Back\n\nOne line of argument to show that\n\n(1)\nThe artist intended x to mean p in work w\n\n\nis logically or epistemically related to\n\n(2)\nx means p in work w\n\n\nbegins by noting that the facts expressed by\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n may not be \u201cconstantly conjoined\u201d, but there\u2019s at\nleast a very strong correlation between the two: the great majority of\ncases of (1) are cases of (2), and the great majority of cases of (2)\nare cases of (1). More than that, given our knowledge of the world,\nit\u2019s plausible to assume that there\u2019s a causal relation\nbetween type-(1) facts and type-(2) facts: in general, type-(1) facts\nbring about or cause type-(2) facts. A universal causal law of the\nform, All M-type facts bring about or cause N-type facts,\nwouldn\u2019t be quite correct in this case, but neither would it be\nin the case of throwing rocks and breaking windows. The causal\ngeneralization is sound enough in both, however. \n\nThat much is common sense and is readily admitted by Beardsley. The\nintention of the artist and the aesthetic object \u201care causally\nconnected\u201d, Beardsley says in Aesthetics\n(Aesth: 19), and if two things, for example, Jones, Sr. and\nJones, Jr., are causally connected, then\n\n\nany evidence about the height of either of them will be\nindirect evidence about the height of the other, in virtue of\ncertain laws of genetics, according to which the tallness of the\nfather affects the probability that the son will be tall, though it\ndoes not, of course, render it certain\u00a0(Aesth:\n19\u201320).\n\n\nThus, Beardsley adds,\n\n\nIn the case of aesthetic object and intention we have direct evidence\nof each: we discover the nature of the object by looking, listening,\nreading, etc., and we discover the intention by biographical inquiry,\nthrough letters, diaries, workbooks\u2014or, if the artist is alive,\nby asking him. But also what we learn about the nature of the object\nitself is indirect evidence of what the artist intended it to be, and\nwhat we learn about the artist\u2019s intention is indirect evidence\nof what the object became. (Aesth: 20)\n\n\nThere are two important points to note about this passage. First,\nalthough Beardsley wrote that in his early work he was concerned\n\n\nwith the logical relevance of information about the intentions of an\nauthor to the interpretation\u2026 of his work,\n\n\nand he \u201ctook the position that there is no such relevance\u201d\n(II: 188), in the last sentence he admits that there is a\n\u201clogical relation\u201d between\n (1)\n and\n (2):\n (1) is indirect, inductive evidence of a causal sort for (2).\nReasoning from type-(1) facts to type-(2) facts is simply reasoning\nfrom causes to effects. Such reasoning doesn\u2019t yield certainty,\nbut it\u2019s generally dependable nonetheless. Thus, in at least\nmany cases, if we knew that the artist intended his work to mean\np, we would have good, though not definitive, reason for\nbelieving that his work means p.\n\nThe second point concerns the distinction between direct and indirect\nevidence drawn by Beardsley. A diary entry is direct evidence of what\nthe artist intended his work to mean; the artist\u2019s intention is\nindirect evidence of what his work means. But why the difference? In\nboth cases, the relation between the items is causal, yet in one the\nevidence is direct, and in the other indirect. If a diary entry is\ndirect evidence of an artist\u2019s intention (reasoning from an\neffect to a cause), then the artist\u2019s intention ought to be\ndirect evidence of what his work means (reasoning from a cause to an\neffect). That\u2019s a conclusion Beardsley certainly wants to avoid.\nIf, on the other hand, the artist\u2019s intention is indirect\nevidence of what his work means (reasoning, as just noted, from a\ncause to an effect), then a diary entry ought to be indirect evidence\nof what he intended (reasoning, again as just noted, from an effect to\na cause).\n\nThis second way of resolving the tension in Beardsley\u2019s remarks\nwould probably be more acceptable to him, but it still carries\nproblems in its train. What does the distinction between direct and\nindirect evidence amount to on it? Something like this: direct\nevidence that S is P is evidence gleaned from an\ninspection of S itself, no other objects being taken into\nconsideration or made epistemic use of. Indirect evidence that\nS is P is evidence that takes objects other than\nS into consideration, or that makes epistemic use of such\nobjects. Thus evidence respecting the height of Jones, Sr. is indirect\nevidence of the height of Jones, Jr., and conversely; diary entries\nare indirect evidence of an artist\u2019s intentions, and conversely;\nand an artist\u2019s intentions are indirect evidence of the meaning\nof his text, and conversely. Direct evidence of Jones, Jr.\u2019s\nheight requires scrutinizing him and not looking elsewhere, however,\nand by the same token direct evidence of the meaning of a work of art\nrequires scrutinizing it and not looking elsewhere.\n\nBut the problem with drawing the distinction this way is that objects\nother than the work of art itself often have to be consulted in order\nto know what the work means, and many of these objects have to be\nregarded as legitimate sources of information, lest interpretation\nbecome impossible. The OED is consulted by even the best of critics,\nand social histories are many times needed to understand cultural and\nhistorical references. Beardsley knows as much and, from \u201cThe\nIntentional Fallacy\u201d onward, insisted on the legitimacy of such\nsources. But as drawn, the distinction between direct and indirect\nevidence doesn\u2019t distinguish between dictionaries and diaries,\nand Beardsley never did define the direct evidence/indirect evidence\ndistinction with sufficient precision to put one on one side of the\ncritical fence, and the other on the other, and have them stay put.\nPerhaps the distinction can be drawn in some way along the lines\nindicated above (which are suggested by Beardsley\u2019s own\nremarks), but more rigor and a principled argument would be\nneeded.\n11. Halfway Between Induction and Deduction\n\nA different way to draw the distinction, not hinted at by Beardsley\nbut perhaps acceptable to him, would be in terms of the nature of the\ninferential relation between (1) and (2). (1) doesn\u2019t entail\n(2), but, as Beardsley admits, it does provide inductive support for\n(2). (1) may or may not be criterial evidence for (2), however. What\nthis last claim means can be made clearer by an analogy with W.D\nRoss\u2019s theory of ethical reasoning.\n\nAccording to Ross,\n\n(L)\nAct A is a lie\n\n\ndoesn\u2019t entail\n\n(W)\nAct A is wrong,\n\n\nfor A might be right even so, when all ethically relevant\nfactors are taken into account. If A helps to save innocent\npeople\u2019s lives, for example, it\u2019s right\u2014actually\nright, as Ross says\u2014even though it\u2019s a lie. Nor is the\nrelation between (L) and (W) causal or inductive. Lying doesn\u2019t\ncause wrongness, and although it might be that most (or even all) lies\nare all-things-considered wrong\u2014actually wrong\u2014it might be\nthat most (or even all) lies aren\u2019t all-things-considered\nwrong\u2014actually wrong. Regardless of which alternative (if\neither) is correct, (L) still provides some reason for thinking that\n(W) is true. That\u2019s to say that the inference from (L) to (W)\nisn\u2019t based on an empirical generalization of any kind. Rather\nthan being deductive evidence or empirically based inductive evidence,\n(L) is criterial evidence for (W). All by itself, irrespective of any\nother considerations, any other premises, it lends some\u00a0but not\ndefinitive\u00a0support to (W). The inference is an immediate one, in\nother words, in the logician\u2019s sense of the term, and since it\nis and isn\u2019t grounded on empirical facts, it looks like a\ndeductive inference. It\u2019s not a deductive inference, however:\nunlike a standard deductive inference, but like a standard inductive\ninference, additional premises\u2014such as \u201cAct A\nsaves many people\u2019s lives\u201d, or \u201cAct A leads\nto many people\u2019s deaths\u201d\u2014can affect the strength of\nthe inference, weakening it in some cases, strengthening it in others,\nand having little to no effect on it in still others. As with a\ntypical inductive argument, strength of inference isn\u2019t an\nall-or-nothing affair. The inference is defeasible, in that\ncountervailing considerations can weigh against the support the\npremise provides, even to the point of nullifying it altogether, or at\nleast very nearly doing so; but it\u2019s also buttressable, in that\nadditional considerations can bolster or further strengthen such\nsupport, even to the point of making the inference well-nigh\ndeductively sound. Or, of course, the inference can be strengthened by\nsome considerations and weakened by others.\n\nWhat this means is that there can be criterial evidence of an\naltogether different sort for (or against) (W).\n\n(3)\nAct A is an act of betraying a friend\n\n\nis also criterial evidence for (W), and there are many other examples\nof such evidence. Whether the wrongness of an act is constituted by\nsuch factors as lying and betrayal, or whether it\u2019s a different\nproperty which supervenes on such factors, is of no moment as far as\nthe matter at hand is concerned. The important point is the\nlogic\u2014or better, the epistemology\u2014of the inferential\nrelation.\n\nWhat all this has to do with the intentional fallacy is this. The\nintentionalist shouldn\u2019t claim that (1) entails (2), for that\nclaim is subject to the numerous counterarguments that Beardsley makes\nfull use of. But the anti-intentionalist, such as Beardsley,\nshouldn\u2019t claim that there\u2019s \u201cno logical\nrelation\u201d between (1) and (2), for there clearly is, even on his\nown showing, a causally grounded, empirically based, standard\ninductive relation between the two. The intentionalist shouldn\u2019t\nrejoice at this admission, however. For two reasons, such a relation\ntells us nothing of any significance about the proper way to interpret\nart. First, similar causal relations can be found to obtain in\nvirtually every domain of inquiry, and they tell us nothing\nsignificant about proper methodology in those domains. The fact that\ntall parents generally have tall children, and tall children generally\nhave tall parents, is of no help in establishing proper methodology in\ngenetics, or even in telling us where to begin our investigation.\nSecond, and more importantly, being founded on a causal connection\nbetween two distinct things, namely\u00a0the artist\u2019s intention\nand the meaning of his work, the empirical generalization that\nunderlies the inference from (1) to (2) presupposes that there\u2019s\na way to identify the meaning of an artist\u2019s work independent of\nconsulting his intentions. That\u2019s not something the\nintentionalist who relies only on a causal connection between the two\nshould be very happy about, for it suggests that the artist\u2019s\nintentions are altogether extrinsic to and independent of the meaning\nof the artist\u2019s work.\n\nThe real debate about the intentional fallacy is, or at least should\nbe, over whether (1) provides criterial evidence for (2). Beardsley\nargues against an entailment relation between the two, admits that\nthere\u2019s an inductive relation but relegates it to the category\nof indirect evidence, and thinks the job is done. The intentionalist\ntypically wonders how the meaning of a work can be utterly divorced\nfrom the voice, the uttering or creating with an intended meaning, of\nthe artist, and brings up hard cases to support the relevance of the\nartist\u2019s intentions. But neither has focused the issue properly.\nBeardsley apparently takes direct evidence to be deductively adequate\nevidence or evidence gleaned from the object itself, and indirect\nevidence to be evidence based on empirical generalizations or gleaned\nfrom something other than the object itself. In neither sense is an\nartist\u2019s intentions direct evidence of what his work means, and\nBeardsley is right that there\u2019s an intentional fallacy. But if,\nas it should be, direct evidence is identified with criterial\nevidence, and indirect evidence with non-criterial but inductive\nevidence, Beardsley has failed to establish that there\u2019s an\nintentional fallacy. On the other hand, the mere strong feeling of the\nintentionalist that the meaning of a work isn\u2019t independent of\nthe intentions of the artist who created it is no proof of anything,\nand the hard cases brought up in support of the relevance of the\nartist\u2019s intentions\u2014typically, cases that involve\nallusion, irony, or obscure passages\u2014can almost always be\nexplained or explained away, and not implausibly, by the\nanti-intentionalist. The mistake of Beardsley is to neglect a\npossibility and thus focus the issue wrongly. The mistake of the\nintentionalist is typically not to focus the issue with any degree of\nprecision, and to rely on relatively vague but strongly held\nintuitions.\n12. Meaning and Speech Acts\n\nWhat\u2019s needed to decide whether there\u2019s an intentional\nfallacy, whether (1) does or doesn\u2019t provide criterial evidence\nfor (2), is, more than anything else, a theory of meaning. A theory of\nmeaning is a theory of what it is for w (some object, in the\nbroad sense of the term) to mean p. Beardsley was always\naware of the need for a theory of meaning, and in Aesthetics\nhe proposed one, a complicated theory which he later rejected. A few\nyears later, however, in his final paper on the topic,\u00a0he\nembraced a speech-act theory based on the work of William Alston and\nused it to defend the intentional fallacy.\n\nSpeech act theory in general is derived from the work of J.L. Austin,\na British philosopher who flourished shortly after World War II.\nAustin distinguishes three things a person typically does in uttering\na sentence, say, \u201cThe door is open\u201d. He utters certain\nwords\u2014\u201cthe\u201d, \u201cdoor\u201d, \u201cis\u201d,\nand \u201copen\u201d\u2014with certain meanings; this is a\nlocutionary act. He states that the door is open; this is an\nillocutionary act. And he convinces someone that the door is open;\nthis is a perlocutionary act. As Austin says, it is in\nuttering a sentence with a certain meaning (that is, in\nperforming a locutionary act) that we perform an illocutionary act.\nIllocutionary acts have come to be called speech acts. Asserting,\nrequesting, arguing, ordering, promising, and so on are all examples\nof speech acts, but there are many, many different speech acts. Last,\nas Austin also says, it is by uttering a certain sentence\nwith a certain meaning that we perform certain other acts, acts partly\ndefined in terms of their effects on listeners: convincing, enraging,\npleasing, deceiving, and so on. These are perlocutionary acts. I utter\nthe words \u201cThe door is open\u201d; in doing so, I\nstate that the door is open; by so doing, I convince you that\nthe door is open.\n\nThese suggestive distinctions led Alston to believe that the meaning\nof a sentence is the sentence\u2019s total speech act potential, its\npotential for performing all of the various speech acts it could be\nused to perform. In effect, this is to take the slogan \u201cMeaning\nis use\u201d very seriously, and to cash in \u201cuse\u201d in\nterms of the performance of speech acts. Sentence meaning is primary\non this theory, and word meaning secondary and derivative, since\nit\u2019s defined in terms of a word\u2019s contribution to the\nspeech act potential of the sentences into which it can figure.\nBeardsley thought this theory correct and used it to argue that the\nintentional fallacy is indeed a fallacy.\n\nIn \u201cIntentions and Interpretations\u201d (1982), he claims that\nin composing a poem the poet doesn\u2019t perform a speech act, but\nrather represents the performance of a speech act or acts. When\nWordsworth writes\n\n\nMilton! Thou shouldst be living at this hour:\n\nEngland hath need of thee\u2014\n\n\nhis words are ostensibly addressed to a long-dead poet, but to perform\nan illocutionary, any illocutionary action, a person must believe that\nhe can \u201csecure uptake\u201d, that is, secure understanding of\nhis sentence and the speech act performed. Wordsworth, however, knew\nthat Milton was long dead\u00a0and had no such belief. He thus\ndidn\u2019t perform the illocutionary act of addressing Milton or\nstating that England needs him. He does represent the performance of\nthose illocutionary acts, however. What poets and other authors of\nliterary works do, Beardsley thinks, is represent the performance of\nillocutionary acts, not perform illocutionary acts themselves.\n\nTo perform illocutionary acts A, B, and C\nis therefore one thing; to represent the performance of illocutionary\nacts, A, B, and C, quite another. The\nlatter doesn\u2019t entail the former, as the above example shows. In\naddition, even if the performance of an illocutionary act is\nnecessarily intentional in one respect\u2014and Beardsley says that\n\u201conly intentional text production can generate illocutionary\nactions\u201d (II: 195)\u2014it doesn\u2019t follow that the\nperformance of illocutionary act x requires, as a condition\nfor its performance, the intention to perform x. I can\ninadvertently insult or warn someone. Some illocutionary acts are\ndefined in terms of an intention, of course\u2014lying, for instance,\nis defined in terms of the intention to deceive\u2014but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean lying is defined in terms of the intention to lie.\nThat would be circular. And it also doesn\u2019t mean that\nrepresenting the act of lying requires the intention to deceive.\nStorytellers frequently represent the act of lying without having any\nsuch intention. A person could intend to lie, or intend to represent\nthe act of lying, of course, but those are different matters.\n\nThe upshot of this is that\n\n\nit is\u2026 plain that representing [an illocutionary act,\nsuch as] an accusation cannot have as its condition an intention to\naccuse, and indeed these are somewhat at odds, for to take the\nrepresentational stance is to renounce or withhold or suspend the\nillocutionary action. (II: 197)\n\n\nThe complete argument, then, is something like this:\n\n(1)\nThe meaning of a sentence \u2018S\u2019 is its total\nillocutionary act potential, that is, its capacity to be used to\nperform the speech acts, I, J, K.\n(2)\nThe performance of speech acts I, J, K\nin using \u2018S\u2019 does not require the corresponding\nintentions to perform speech acts I, J, K\nin using \u2018S.\u2019\n(3)\nThus, the meaning of \u2018S\u2019 is independent of\nthe intentions of the speaker to perform the speech acts that\nconstitute, as potentially performable acts, the meaning of\n\u2018S.\u2019\n(4)\nDifferently put, the meaning of \u2018S\u2019 is\nlogically independent of the speaker\u2019s intention to mean what\n\u2018S\u2019 does in fact mean.\n(5)\nTherefore, a speaker\u2019s intention that sentence\n\u2018S\u2019 mean p is logically irrelevant to\nwhether it does mean p.\n(6)\nBut even if\n (4)\n were false, and the meaning, M, of a non-literary\nsentence\u2014a sentence not in a work of literature\u2014were\npartly a function of the speaker\u2019s intention that it mean\nM, the same wouldn\u2019t be true of a literary\nsentence.\n\n\nThe proof of\n (6)\n is that\n\n(7)\nAn author does not perform an illocutionary act, I,\nJ, K in uttering (writing, dictating, signing, etc.)\n\u2018S.\u2019\n(8)\nRather, he represents the performance of illocutionary acts\nI, J, K in uttering\n\u2018S.\u2019\n(9)\nRepresenting an illocutionary action involves renouncing,\nwithholding, or suspending the performance of that action.\n(10)\nThus, representing the performance of I, J,\nK doesn\u2019t require the intention to perform I,\nJ, K.\n(11)\nConsequently, even if\n (4)\n were false as far as non-literary sentences were concerned, it would\nbe true as far as literary sentences were concerned, for the meaning\nof \u2018S\u2019 is logically independent of the\nspeaker\u2019s intention to mean what \u2018S\u2019 in\nfact does mean.\n\n\nThis is an interesting and provocative argument, but it can be\nquestioned at several points. One of its limitations is that, even if\nit\u2019s successful, it proves only that an author\u2019s\nintentions are irrelevant to the correct interpretation of his text.\nEssentially employing speech act theory as it does, it doesn\u2019t\napply to the interpretation of works of art other than\nliterature\u2014paintings, sculptures, and dances, for example. This\nis a minor point, though, as analogous concepts are probably\navailable, or could be introduced without too much unnaturalness, in\nall the arts.\n\nMore bothersome is that the key concept here is an unexplained and\nseemingly unexplainable one. No one has provided a rigorous definition\nof a speech act. Even these many years after Austin first introduced\nthe concept in the 1950s, little more has been done to clarify and\nground it than to cite some handy examples, place the foils of\nlocutionary and perlocutionary acts to the left and right of it, and\ninvoke the \u201cin\u201d versus \u201cby\u201d distinction found\nabove and in virtually every other exposition of the notion. Most\nphilosophers are at least somewhat hesitant to make a concept\nthat\u2019s technical yet so little explained or pinned down the\nmainstay of a substantial theory, such as a theory of meaning.\n\nThat aside, speech act theories of meaning have received their own\nshare of criticism over the years. One objection to a theory like\nAlston\u2019s\u2014and the acceptability of his theory can\u2019t\nbe pursued at length here\u2014is that it explicates sentence meaning\nin terms of speech act potential, and thus requires that the\nillocutionary acts that a sentence can be used to perform be\nidentifiable independently of and prior to the meaning of the sentence\nused to perform those illocutionary acts. But that\u2019s impossible,\nthe objection runs, and in fact gets things backward. To identify the\nact of stating that the door is open, rather than, say, the act of\nasking for an ice cream cone, as an act that the sentence \u201cThe\ndoor is open\u201d can be used to perform\u2014to identify the\nformer but not the latter as part of the sentence\u2019s speech act\npotential\u2014requires that the meaning of the sentence first be\nunderstood and identified. Absent an understanding of its meaning,\nit\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what acts it could be used to perform.\nSpeech act potential is a function of meaning, not, as the theory has\nit, meaning a function of speech act potential.\n\nIndependent of these objections is the fact that the argument\ndoesn\u2019t really prove what it\u2019s supposed to. If it\u2019s\ncorrect, it shows that within and/or without literary discourse,\nit\u2019s possible for \u2018S\u2019 to mean M\nwithout it being true that the speaker or author intended that\n\u2018S\u2019 mean M. But all that means is that\n\n\n\u2018S\u2019 means M\n\n\ndoesn\u2019t entail\n\n\nThe speaker or author intended that \u2018S\u2019 mean\nM.\n\n\nIn effect, this is another demonstration that Hirsch is wrong, that\nsentence meaning isn\u2019t identical with speaker meaning. The\nquestion at issue, however, is whether speaker meaning is criterial\nevidence for sentence meaning. For all that the argument shows, it\ncould well be.\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of whether literature is representation,\nthat is, as Beardsley uses the term, one kind of \u201cimitation of a\ncompound illocutionary act\u201d. \u201cThe writing of a\npoem\u201d, Beardsley writes elsewhere (PC: 58, 59),\n\n\nis not an illocutionary act; it is the creation of a fictional\ncharacter performing a fictional illocutionary act.\n\n\nBut in his Essay on Man, does Pope create a fictional\ncharacter who details his views, or does he simply speak his mind in\npoetic form? The more intuitive answer is the latter, but Beardsley is\ncommitted to the former. What makes the Essay on Man\ndidactic, he says, is not that it contains arguments put forward by\nPope (arguing is an illocutionary act), but that it contains\nimitations of arguments put forward by a fictional character (PC:\n60\u201361). We know this because Pope\n\n\nembodies his doctrines in a discourse that flaunts its poetic form (in\nsound and meaning) and directs attention to itself as an object of\nrewarding scrutiny.\n\n\nThe \u201cillocutionary fuse is [therefore] drawn\u201d, and the\npoem\n\n\nrelinquishes its illocutionary force for aesthetic status, and takes\non the character of being an appearance or a show of living language\nuse. (PC: 60)\n\n\nAlthough this position can\u2019t be definitively refuted, it\u2019s\nimplausible\u00a0and subject to the rejoinder that what Pope did is\nhimself speak in the poem, making sure that neither aesthetic interest\nnor useful instruction were ever altogether lacking. Independent of\nstrong theoretical reasons for thinking otherwise, that\u2019s a\nsimpler and better explanation than Beardsley\u2019s. The point can\nbe reinforced if didactic literary works other than poems are\nconsidered. Aldous Huxley\u2019s essays are literary works, but\nit\u2019s even more implausible to posit a fictional speaker for\nthem, and to think of them as imitations of compound illocutionary\nacts, rather than simply as compound speech acts performed by\nHuxley.\n\nBut even if Beardsley\u2019s view that a literary work is a\nrepresentation or imitation of a speech act is acceptable, still\nanother curious feature of the argument concerns his treatment of the\ndistinction between performing a speech act and representing the\nperformance of a speech act. Beardsley writes as if the two were\nmutually exclusive. They\u2019re not. While it\u2019s true that\nit\u2019s one thing to state that p and quite another to\nrepresent that someone is stating that p, representing (in\nlanguage) is itself a speech act just as much as stating is.\nRepresenting that someone is stating that p is like stating\nthat someone is stating that p\u2014just a speech act with a\nmore complicated conceptual content and structure than simply stating\nthat p. Given that that\u2019s so, the two halves of\nBeardsley argument,\n (1)\u2013(5)\n and\n (6)\u2013(11),\n merge.\n\nAnd it\u2019s probably a good thing that representing is a speech\nact. If \u201cMilton!\u201d in Wordsworth\u2019s poem were being\nused in a representation that wasn\u2019t the performance of any\nspeech act at all, that would presumably be because it had no speech\nact potential. On the Alston/Beardsley theory of meaning, it would\nthen have no meaning. Since it evidently does have meaning, it has to\nhave some speech act potential. And since it seems to share a good\ndeal of its meaning with \u201cMilton!\u201d as bellowed by a\nseventeenth century fish-monger hailing the poet, its speech act\npotentials within and without the poem must overlap to a fair\nextent\u2014all this on the assumption that the Alston/Beardsley\ntheory of meaning is correct. The gulf that Beardsley sees between\nliterary discourse and non-literary discourse, as far as speech acts\nare concerned, thus isn\u2019t nearly as wide as he seems to think,\neven if a literary work is a representation or imitation of a speech\nact.\n13. Criteria and Meaning\n\nThe problems with Beardsley\u2019s argument are significant enough to\nconclude that it needn\u2019t be accepted. The question still\nremains, however, whether an author\u2019s intention that\n\u2018S\u2019 means M is criterial evidence for\nits meaning M. That question can be asked independently of\nBeardsley\u2019s argument, but on the assumption that his preferred\ntheory of meaning is correct (thereby, as in much of the above,\nputting to the side general objections to speech act theory and speech\nact theories of meaning) or on the assumption that another theory of\nmeaning is correct. As far as the question at issue is concerned, in\nother words, it probably doesn\u2019t make much difference whether\nthe Beardsley/Alston theory is correct, or some other theory is. In\nall likelihood, the result would be the same. But regardless of\nwhether it would or wouldn\u2019t, exploring alternative theories of\nmeaning is impossible in this context, so only the Alston/Beardsley\ntheory will be considered below.\n\nIn addition, though, and as Beardsley\u2019s argument in effect\nreminds us, there might be important differences between non-literary\nand literary discourse, such that what holds (or doesn\u2019t hold)\nin one doesn\u2019t hold (or holds) in the other. The very nature of\nliterature might itself make a difference. Two determinations are\nneeded, then, one respecting the relevance or irrelevance of an\nauthors\u2019 intentions in non-literary discourse and one respecting\nwhether the fact that a discourse is literary makes it importantly\ndifferent from non-literary discourse as far as the relevance of\nauthors\u2019 intentions is concerned. In what follows, the issue\nconcerning non-literary discourse will be discussed first and at\nlength; the issue concerning literary discourse, second and much more\nbriefly.\n\nOn a speech act theory of meaning, the inference from\n\n(1)\nThe author intended x to mean p in work\nw\n\n\nto\n\n(2)\nx means p in work w\n\n\nis the inference from\n\n(A)\nThe author intended x to mean p in writing work\nw\n\n\nto\n\n(B)\nx means p in work w.\n\n\nFurther glossed in terms of speech acts (but slurring over\nconsiderations of intensionality), this is the inference from\n\n(C)\nThe author intended x to have illocutionary act potential\nz in writing x in work w\n\n\nto\n\n(D)\nx has illocutionary act potential z in work\nw,\n\n\nwhere the inference is supposedly criterial, and z is the\ntotal illocutionary act potential\u2014the potential to perform\nillocutionary acts I, J, K\u2014that\nconstitutes the meaning of x. The question at issue here is a\nspecies of a genus, the genus being whether intending that s\nis p is criterial evidence for s\u2019s being\np, with the differentia being that s is a piece of\nnon-literary discourse and p a meaning, a speech act\npotential.\n\nAnswering this question requires taking a slight detour. In the 1950s\nand 1960s premises respecting behavior were frequently said to be\ncriterial evidence for the existence of mental states of certain kinds\n(though the matter wasn\u2019t very clearly delineated or explained,\nand the term \u201ccriterial evidence\u201d didn\u2019t exist). The\nmost discussed example, originating in the work of Wittgenstein,\nconcerned pain behavior and pain: a person\u2019s pain behavior was\nsaid to be criterial evidence for his being in pain. The inference\nfrom (C) to (D) is, near enough, the converse inference, from a mental\nstate to behavior or, more properly, from a mental state to an effect,\nan object (a piece of discourse) having a certain property (a certain\nspeech act potential).\n\nThe central question to ask about any supposed criterial inference is\nwhether we understand the nature of the phenomena mentioned in the\npremise and conclusion to be necessarily caught up with other, but not\nin such a way that the presence of either entails the other. If\nA is a criterion of B, then it\u2019s a necessary\ntruth that A is evidence for, or counts toward,\nB\u2014so says Anthony Kenny in speaking of a criterion in\nthe sense intended here. If a criterion is understood in this\nway\u2014and the term is certainly being used in a technical,\nnon-everyday sense if it is\u2014there\u2019s a fair amount of\nintuitive appeal to the claim that pain behavior is a criterion for\nbeing in pain. Our understanding of what pain and pain behavior are\nseems to connect the two necessarily. That\u2019s true even if no one\nin pain ever exhibits pain behavior, or everyone exhibits pain\nbehavior when not in pain. (Admittedly, the scenarios for either state\nof affairs would be very strange. Neither is impossible, though.)\nLikewise, although every act of lying could turn out to be right, and\nevery act of non-lying turn out to be wrong, our understanding of what\nwrongness and lying are is such that the latter necessarily counts\ntoward the former. On the other hand, our understanding of drinking\narsenic and dying\u2014of what they are\u2014isn\u2019t such that\ndrinking arsenic is criterial for dying. It\u2019s not that our\nunderstanding of dying is somehow necessarily caught up with the idea\nof drinking arsenic the way it is in the pain-pain behavior and\nlying-wrongness cases. Even if every time a person drank arsenic he\ndied, and every time a person died he had drunk arsenic, the\nconnection between the two is purely inductive.\n\nHow is it then with the inference from\n\n(C)\nThe author intended x to have illocutionary act potential\nz in writing x in work w\n\n\nto\n\n(D)\nx has illocutionary act potential z in work\nw?\n\n\nConsider an example discussed on a number of occasions by Beardsley\nand already cited above: Humpty Dumpty. Humpty Dumpty says,\n\u201cThere\u2019s glory for you!\u201d, and his sentence, he\nclaims, means there\u2019s a nice knockdown argument for you. Alice\ndoesn\u2019t believe him. It means that, Humpty Dumpty explains,\nbecause \u201cwhen I use a word, it means just what I choose\nit to mean\u2014neither more nor less\u201d. Alice doubts that he\ncan make the sentence mean that just by choosing that it mean that.\nCommon sense is certainly on her side. Beardsley\u2019s reply is a\nlittle different. He says that because Humpty Dumpty has provided no\nstipulative definition of \u201cglory\u201d, he knows that Alice\ncan\u2019t be expected to \u201csecure uptake\u201d, that is,\nunderstand the novel meaning he attaches to use of the word, and thus\ncan\u2019t intend to perform the speech act of boasting that his\nargument for the superiority of unbirthdays to birthdays is a\nconclusive one. Since meaning is constituted by speech act potential,\nhe therefore can\u2019t intend to mean \u201cnice knockdown\nargument\u201d by \u201cglory\u201d (II: 202\u2013203).\n\nWhat Beardsley says here is basically correct. To show that the\nintentional fallacy is indeed a fallacy, however, to show that (C)\nisn\u2019t criterial evidence for (D), the premise concerning the\nauthor\u2019s intention should be assumed to be true, and the\nstrength of the inference gauged on that assumption. If a fallacy has\nindeed been committed, the premise, considered simply by itself, will\nlend no support to the conclusion. But instead of examining the case\nof Humpty Dumpty as just indicated, Beardsley questions the truth of\nthe premise, and correctly finds it wanting. That isn\u2019t to the\npoint.\n\nIn fact, several things might be said in favor of a criterial relation\nbetween (C) and (D). First, the cases of moral rightness and pain\nsuggest that a natural home for criteria is in phenomena that are\nundeniable but unobservable. Much, if not all, of what can\u2019t be\nobserved but is obviously real needs a criterion or criteria to gain a\nfoothold in our thinking and discourse. (It could even be argued that\neverything that figures in our thinking and discourse, whether\nobservable or non-observable, stands in need of a criterion or\ncriteria. Kenny, for one, holds as much.) Linguistic meaning seems to\nbe just that sort of thing. Second, rightness, pain, and meaning,\nthough real, seem to be ontologically slighter than paradigmatically\nreal things, such as physical objects (stars), forces\n(electro-magnetism), or even everyday properties and property\ninstantiations (weighing five pounds, Philadelphia\u2019s being in\nPennsylvania). Their conceptual connections to the well-anchored items\nof everyday life\u2014rocks, gravity, shapes\u2014are few in number,\nand re-identification of one and the same pain, for example, more\ninherently problematic. A pain is not something and not nothing,\nWittgenstein wrote, and though the remark is cryptic, much the same\nseems to be true of meaning. Part of its life needs to be breathed\ninto it by criteria. Third, there\u2019s Beardsley\u2019s own\nconcession that \u201conly intentional text production can generate\nillocutionary actions\u201d, and therefore meaning, on his theory of\nmeaning. If an author\u2019s intention is necessary for a text to\nhave a meaning at all, that suggests that the intention that\nx mean m is criterial\u2014not logically necessary\nbut criterial\u2014for x\u2019s meaning m. Bolstering this\nsuggestion is the fact that it\u2019s hard to imagine that x\nmeans m, but that no one has ever intended that x mean\nm in producing a text that contains x.\n\nThese considerations, however, are more inconclusive hints at\narguments than arguments themselves. First, the fact that meanings are\nunobservable but real suggests that we should be on the lookout for\ncriteria; it doesn\u2019t mean that they have criteria. More is\nneeded to show that. Numbers, it might be argued, are also\nunobservable but real, yet stand in need of no criteria. Second, apart\nfrom the obscurity of the notion of ontological slightness, meanings\nare surely no more ontologically slender than numbers, which, again,\nseem to require no criteria. Finally, there\u2019s the point that\neven if the promissory notes that really are the first two\nconsiderations can be made good on, all that would show is that\nmeaning in general stands in need of a criterion or criteria. It\nwouldn\u2019t show that a criterion of a text\u2019s having meaning\nis an author\u2019s intention that it have meaning, much less that a\ncriterion for a text\u2019s having the meaning that it has is the\nauthor\u2019s intention that it have that meaning.\n\nBut the third consideration may come to the rescue here. Beardsley\nhimself says that intentional text production is necessary for a text\nto have a meaning (an admission, incidentally, which goes against a\nnumber of things he wrote earlier in his career), and it\u2019s a\nnatural step from there to an author\u2019s intention as criterial\nfor textual meaning, indeed, as criterial for a conceptual\ncorrespondence between the two (intending to mean m, meaning m). In\naddition, even if it\u2019s not a necessary truth that if\n\u2018S\u2019 means m, someone at some time intended that\n\u2018S\u2019 mean m in producing a token of\n\u2018S\u2019, the former is at least criterial for the\nlatter.\n\nBut why the claim just mentioned isn\u2019t a necessary truth is\ninstructive. It\u2019s not because it\u2019s possible that\nA, the first and only user of \u2018S\u2019,\nmistakenly thought there was a linguistic convention according to\nwhich \u2018S\u2019 means n. Operating on that assumption,\nhe uttered \u2018S\u2019, intending it to mean n. However,\nbecause of contextual clues respecting the surroundings in which\n\u2018S\u2019 was used, because of the topic under\ndiscussion when it was used, and because of ignorance and\nmisunderstanding (of the language and of what A was driving at) on the\npart of his listeners, all his listeners took it that there was\nalready a linguistic convention according to which\n\u2018S\u2019 means m. That\u2019s how they understood\n\u2018S\u2019, and they thus believed and acted\naccordingly. A, oblivious to the misunderstanding on their part, soon\nforgets about \u2018S\u2019 and the meaning he attached to\nit. In these circumstances, \u2018S\u2019 means m\nbecause that\u2019s what the language-using community takes it to\nmean: in effect, their beliefs and behavior establish a convention\naccording to which \u2018S\u2019 means m. The meaning rests\non what might be called \u201ccommunity uptake\u201d, not individual\nuptake of speech act performance, as Beardsley has it, and not the\nspeaker\u2019s intention, as intentionalists have it.\n\nThis strange little scenario is important not so much because\nit\u2019s a counterexample to the claim that if\n\u2018S\u2019 means m, then at some time someone means\nm in using \u2018S\u2019, but as illustrating\nsomething of greater importance: the existence of a linguistic\nconvention that \u2018S\u2019 means m is a\ncriterion, in the technical sense explained above, for\n\u2018S\u2019 meaning m. It\u2019s not a logically\nsufficient condition, not definitive evidence, at least as far as the\nmeaning of a token sentence is concerned, for in specific\ncircumstances other factors may override the meaning specified by the\nconvention. That, in fact, has to be the case if metaphor, synecdoche,\nmetonymy, and irony are to be possible at all. (Briefly, a token\nsentence is a sentence considered as a concrete particular, with a\nspecifiable spatio-temporal location. Token sentences contrast with\ntype sentences. A type sentence is an abstract particular, not\nlocatable in space and time. All token sentences are tokens of a type,\nin much the same way that all token 2023 Toyota\nCorollas\u2014spatio-temporal objects found on streets and\nhighways\u2014are tokens of a single type, 2023\u00a0Toyota Corolla.\nAs far as sentences are concerned, what this amounts to is that a\nsingle type sentence, \u2018S\u2019, can have many tokens.\nThere\u2019s only one type sentence \u201cThe door is open\u201d,\nbut there are many tokens of that type, a number of which can be found\nin this article.) Linguistic conventions are one factor that has to be\nconsidered in every case of token sentence meaning. They may not be\nthe last word in determining token sentence meaning\u2014though they\nfrequently are just that\u2014but they\u2019re always the first\nword.\n\nPerhaps paradoxically, given what was just said, the counterexample\nalso illustrates a more important claim, that a speaker\u2019s\nintention that \u2018S\u2019 mean m is a criterion\nfor its meaning m, or at least very nearly so. This is because: (1)\nlinguistic convention is a criterion for token sentence meaning, and a\nlinguistic convention, as the example shows, is a function of overall\ncommunity understanding, treatment, and belief. (2) A speaker\u2019s\nintention is one component in such understanding, treatment, and\nbelief, and thus is criterial for linguistic convention. In other\nwords, since a speaker of a language is a member of the linguistic\ncommunity in which he speaks, and since, as Beardsley himself holds,\nan intention that \u2018S\u2019 means m involves a\nbelief that \u2018S\u2019 means m, the speaker\u2019s\nintention figures into the overall function that determines the\ncreation or maintenance of a convention. (3) The relation \u201cis\ncriterial for\u201d is transitive, or at least very nearly so. If\nX\u2019s being criterial for Y and Y\u2019s being criterial for Z\ndoesn\u2019t entail that X is criterial for Z, it still\nlends some near criterial support for Z. More briefly but slightly\ninaccurately, the argument is that since a speaker\u2019s intention\nthat \u2018S\u2019 means m is criterial for the\nexistence of a convention that \u2018S\u2019 means m, and\nthe existence of a convention that \u2018S\u2019 means\nm is criterial for \u2018S\u2019\u2019s meaning\nm, a speaker\u2019s intention that \u2018S\u2019 means\nm is criterial for \u2018S\u2019 meaning m. A\nspeaker\u2019s intention must thus be regarded as having some\nevidential weight in determining his sentence\u2019s meaning. As far\nas everyday discourse is concerned, then, the intentional fallacy is\nno fallacy at all, strictly speaking.\n14. The Letter of the Law and The Spirit of the Law\n\nBut the letter of the law is one thing, its spirit quite another. Even\nif speaker intention counts for something, for two reasons, it\ndoesn\u2019t count for much, at least in the great majority of cases.\nOne swallow is not a summer, and a single such intention or belief not\na convention or, except in very odd circumstances, sufficient for one.\nCases like those of Humpty Dumpty and the counterexample discussed\nabove show how slight the weight of a speaker\u2019s intention is in\nthe face of a convention that\u2019s already established (the case of\nHumpty Dumpty) or even in the process of being established (the case\nof A and his community). And the situation we in fact find ourselves\nin is just that of Alice. The weight carried by pre-existing\nlinguistic conventions makes it look as if Humpty Dumpty\u2019s\nintention has no weight at all. If what was argued above is correct,\nit doesn\u2019t have no weight, but a microgram is, for practical\npurposes, weightless when counterbalanced by a boulder. Thus even if\nstrictly speaking, there\u2019s no intentional fallacy, it would be\nmuch more misleading in practice to say that there isn\u2019t one\nthan that there is one.\n\nThe case of Humpty Dumpty shouldn\u2019t be misunderstood, however.\nThe establishment or maintenance of a linguistic convention\nisn\u2019t simply a matter of majority opinion within a speaking\ncommunity. A convention is more than a collection of beliefs,\nunderstandings, and treatments. It carries normative force with it,\nand normative force, although undergirded by and impossible without\ncommunity support, doesn\u2019t simply sway in the direction that the\nbreeze of majority opinion happens to be blowing at the time. The\nnormative nature of a convention enables it to be relatively, though\nnot wholly, resistant to contrary opinion. That\u2019s why it\u2019s\npossible for most people to spell \u201caccommodate\u201d\nincorrectly (the conventions of spelling call for it to be spelled\nwith two \u2018m\u2019s, but most people spell it with one)\nand why it\u2019s possible for most people to have an incorrect\nbelief about the meaning of the word \u201cfortuitous\u201d (the\nconventions of the language call for it to mean by chance or\naccidental, but most people think it means\nlucky).\n\nThe second reason why the conclusion that, strictly speaking,\nthere\u2019s no intentional fallacy is of limited import is in effect\npointed out by Beardsley. The notion of speaker meaning\u2014a\nspeaker\u2019s intention that \u2018S\u2019 mean\nm in his utterance of \u2018S\u2019\u2014is\nparasitic on that of a convention, and thus on sentence meaning. In\nintending what he does, that is, in intending that his sentence mean\nm, and not n, o, or p, a speaker\nis perforce trying to conform to what he takes to be a pre-existing\nconvention. If he doesn\u2019t take there to be such a convention, he\nneeds to stipulate one\u2014which itself involves invoking\npre-existing conventions. If he doesn\u2019t do that and\ndoesn\u2019t try to conform to a pre-existing convention,\nthere\u2019s no reason to think that he\u2019s trying to\ncommunicate, to utter a sentence with a determinate meaning, or to\nperform any speech act at all. In other words, without the assumption\nof a pre-existing convention, there\u2019s no content to the notion\nof an intention to mean anything at all, much less to mean m.\nEven if a speaker\u2019s intention is criterial in determining\nconventions and sentence meaning, conventions have to be\nconceptualized as relatively independent of the speaker, as logically\nprior to speaker meaning, and as a constraint on speaker meaning.\n\nThe upshot is that, to put a fine point on it, there\u2019s no\nintentional fallacy, but that a fine point shouldn\u2019t be put on\nit. As far as everyday discourse is concerned, proper interpretive\npractice directs us to ignore speakers\u2019 intentions. For\nconsidered in and of itself, in the context of a living, fully\ndeveloped language, a speaker\u2019s intention has vanishingly small\nweight, noticeable at all, if ever, only in a very small number of\ncircumstances. An additional merit of this view is that it helps to\nexplain the facts that (1) in the vast majority of cases, questions of\nspeaker intention needn\u2019t and don\u2019t arise in interpreting\na person\u2019s remarks; (2) hard cases are\npossible\u2014conventions are of necessity open-ended, somewhat\nindefinite, and possibly in tension with other conventions; (3)\nit\u2019s natural, and not entirely unreasonable, to evoke speaker\nintention\u00a0to resolve such hard cases; (4) the gnawing feeling\nthat the meaning of an utterance isn\u2019t altogether divorced from\nthe meaning intention of its speaker has some basis; (5) despite (3),\nproponents of the intentional fallacy can always find ways of\nresolving hard cases without invoking the intentions of the\nspeaker.\n15. Back to Literary Discourse\n\nSo much for non-literary discourse. The second question is: Does what\nholds for non-literary discourse also hold for literary discourse?\nBeardsley\u2019s convinced that it does. He sees no fundamental\ndifference between the two. There\u2019s a lot to be said for that\nview. It largely jibes with our interpretive experience and recognizes\nthe continuity of all forms of discourse. It also doesn\u2019t\nrequire us to read by a new set of rules when we put down The\nRacing Forum and pick up Ruskin, which is certainly appealing.\nThose are impressive reasons in its favor, and strongly recommend it\nfor adoption.\n\nBut the key word here is \u201cadoption\u201d. The view is a\nproposal for how to conceptualize literature (and in the long run art\nin general); it isn\u2019t dictated by the facts of the case or by\nthe very concept of literature. An alternative proposal, and a popular\none in many circles, is to conceptualize literature as much more\nclosely tied to the life of the author, and to attach greater\ninterpretive weight to his intentions than with non-literary\ndiscourse. This proposal does bifurcate discourse, but, advocates\nwould claim, there are cultural and aesthetic advantages to doing so.\nThree of them are that (1) literature is thereby tied much more\nclosely to biography, history, and culture in general, (2) the realm\nof the aesthetic is not as segregated from, but is much more\nintegrated into, other valuational realms than it would otherwise be,\nand (3) natural, even irrepressible, urges to look beyond art to the\nartist aren\u2019t automatically frustrated or denigrated, as far as\ncriticism is concerned. The systematic virtues and vices of both this\nposition and Beardsley\u2019s can\u2019t be pursued here, but it is\nimportant to note that the issue is a large and overarching one\nconcerning how best to conceptualize art and its place in human\nlife.\n16. The Internal and the External\n\nBroader than concerns about the artist\u2019s intention and\nencompassing them is the distinction between external and internal\nevidence. The distinction is similar to, but diverges from, that\nbetween direct and indirect evident noted above. \u201cInternal\nevidence\u201d, Beardsley says, \u201cis evidence from direct\ninspection of the object\u201d (Aesth: 20). What is internal\nis publicly accessible;\n\n\nit is discovered [in the case of poetry] through the semantics and\nsyntax of a poem, through our habitual knowledge of the language\nthrough grammars, dictionaries, and all the literature which is the\nsource of dictionaries, in general through all that makes a language\nand culture. (IF: 477)\n\n\n\u201cExternal evidence\u201d, on the other hand,\n\n\nis evidence from the psychological and social background of the\nobject, from which we may infer something about the object itself.\n(Aesth: 20)\n\n\nWhat is external is not publicly accessible; it is\n\n\nprivate or idiosyncratic; not [again in the case of poetry] a part of\nthe work as a linguistic fact: it consists of revelations (in\njournals, for example, or letters or recorded conversations) about how\nor why the poet wrote the poem\u2014to what lady, while sitting on\nwhat lawn, or at the death of a friend or brother. (IF:\n477\u2013478)\n\n\nIn addition to internal and external evidence, there is\n\n\nan intermediate kind of evidence about the character of the author or\nabout private or semi-private meanings attached to words or topics by\nthe author or by a coterie of which he is a member. (IF: 478)\n\n\nExternal evidence is verboten, but at least at the time of \u201cThe\nIntentional Fallacy\u201d, intermediate evidence was admissible, the\nreason being that\n\n\nthe meaning of words is the history of words, and the biography of an\nauthor, his use of a word, and the associations the word had for\nhim, are part of the word\u2019s history and meaning. (IF:\n478)\n\n\nCaution has to be exercised, though, for the line between intermediate\nevidence and external evidence isn\u2019t sharp\u00a0and\n\n\na critic who is concerned with [internal] evidence\u2026 and\nmoderately with [intermediate] evidence will in the long run produce a\ndifferent sort of comment from that of the critic who is concerned\nwith [external] evidence and with [intermediate] evidence. (IF:\n478)\n\n\nThe distinction thus drawn is far from clear, though. On the one hand,\ninformation gleaned from a poet\u2019s diary, workbook, letters, and\nrough drafts, or information about what he was reading or thinking\nabout as he created his work, isn\u2019t internal evidence in that it\ncan\u2019t be had from directly inspecting his poem. On the other\nhand, it does seem to be internal, in that such information is\npublicly accessible, and might well be part of \u201call that makes a\nlanguage and culture\u201d. Resolving that tension is only part of\nthe issue, however. \u201cThe character of the author\u201d or the\n\u201cprivate or semi-private meanings attached to words or topics by\nthe author or by a coterie of which he is a member\u201d might be\nrevealed in a diary or workbook, and part of a \u201cword\u2019s\nhistory and meaning\u201d might be recorded in a letter. That makes\nit sound like intermediate evidence. More than anything else, though,\nwhat a diary or a workbook contains is \u201cevidence [respecting]\nthe psychological and social background\u201d of a work, and such\ninformation is no different from \u201crevelations\u2026 in\njournals\u2026 or letters\u201d. It would thus seem to be external\nevidence, as Beardsley talks about it. Is the information found in\ndiaries, journals, workbooks, rough drafts, letters, and so on\ninternal, external, or intermediate evidence, then? All three, it\nwould seem.\n\nThough the distinction between kinds of evidence isn\u2019t well\ndrawn by Beardsley, that may be because when he wrote \u201cThe\nIntentional Fallacy\u201d his views weren\u2019t as clear or\ndefinite as they were later to become, or because he later changed his\nmind and became more tough-minded. Intermediate evidence is never\nmentioned in Aesthetics or in any of his subsequent writings,\nand if the distinction between internal and external evidence is\nconsidered only as it\u2019s drawn in Aesthetics, it\u2019s\nrelatively clean: internal evidence is evidence based on a direct\ninspection of the aesthetic object and nothing else; external evidence\nis evidence based on sources outside the object. That at least seems\nto draw a fairly bright line between the internal and the external.\nUnfortunately, drawing the distinction this way re-introduces the\nproblems about not using external sources noted above in relation to\nthe intentional fallacy.\n\nAll of that said, the feeling remains that there has to be something\nto the internal/external distinction, even if it isn\u2019t\nexplicated in a satisfactory way by Beardsley. Intuitively, some\nproperties are properties of a work, and some properties aren\u2019t\nproperties of a work. Related to this is what\u2019s really at issue,\nthe matter of proper methodology, or the epistemology of\ninterpretation: some evidence is relevant to what a work\nmeans\u2014and what else but properties of the work itself?\u2014and\nsome evidence isn\u2019t logically relevant to what a work\nmeans\u2014and what else but properties of things other than the\nwork? Put this way, the distinction seems inevitable, and indeed,\nit\u2019s hard to see how art criticism can get along without it.\nRejecting it altogether is tantamount to inviting \u201cchaos of\nthought and passion, all confused\u201d\u2014in other words, the\npotential relevance of anything and everything to interpretation, and\nthus no limits on what a work of art can justifiably be said to mean.\nDeconstructionists may well welcome such unlimited freedom, but lesser\nbreeds who like the law\u2014which includes historicist, romantic,\npsychoanalytic, and other critics, besides new critics\u2014will\nwonder whether the very idea of interpretation has been lost in the\nmidst of anarchy.\n\nBut even if an internal/external distinction of some sort is well-nigh\nnecessary, it\u2019s probably best not to couch it in exactly those\nterms. The real issue isn\u2019t so much what\u2019s in and\nwhat\u2019s out as what\u2019s relevant and what\u2019s not.\nBeardsley\u2019s terminology not only obscures that fact\u00a0but\nskews the true substantive issue: strongly suggested by the very use\nof the terms \u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d is that\nrelevant information is internal to a work, that is, propositions\nwhose subject terms refer to the work or part of the work and whose\npredicate terms refer to properties discernible by experiencing the\nwork; and irrelevant information is external to a work, that is,\npropositions whose subject terms refer to something other than the\nwork or part of the work, or to properties not discernible by\nexperiencing the work.\n\nIn the long run, the distinction will have to be drawn, just as the\nissue of the intentional fallacy will have to be decided, on the basis\nof a comprehensive theory of meaning in conjunction with a rich and\nwell-worked-out conception of art.\n",
