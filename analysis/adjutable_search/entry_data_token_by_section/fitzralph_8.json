    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Divine omnipotence\n6.2 Divine omnipotence\n\n\nLeff judged that it was Ockham and his followers who pushed the\nconsequences of the discontinuity between faith and reason to often\nirreverent conclusions in the debate on the potentia Dei.\nThus, thinkers such as Robert Holcot and Adam of Wodeham seem to show a\nsheer fascination with the paradoxes open to God in his absolute power,\na fascination that led them to positions which were hardly in keeping\nwith traditional Christian teaching. FitzRalph opposes such views\nby appealing to the Augustinian tradition. God\u2019s potentia\nabsoluta merely refers to God\u2019s ability to act outside the\npresent dispensation. Furthermore, God\u2019s omnipotence entails His\ninability to sin and to deceive, just as it also excludes his dying. In\nother words, what God cannot do is to act against his own nature: God\ncannot be other than the summum bonum. God\u2019s power does\nnot consist simply and solely of doing anything whatsoever; his limit\nis not just his freedom from contradicting himself, as others\nheld\u2014rather it is his own nature. Since God is most good, most\nmerciful, and most just, his omnipotence must be in accordance with\nthese aspects of his nature. For God to act otherwise would not be a\nsign of omnipotence but of impotence, since it would involve a denial\nor negation of his own nature. Thus, what is possible from the point of\nview of omnipotence taken in itself, is impossible from the point of\nview of God\u2019s goodness, mercy, and justice, and thus impossible\nnot by reason of his power (ratione potentie) but by reason of\nhis justice or goodness (ratione iustitie vel\nbonitatis).\n",
