    "main_text": "Philosophizing With Others?\n5. Philosophy For Children Today\n\nIn light of the rapidly expanding international interest in philosophy\nfor children, the International Council for Philosophical Inquiry with\nChildren (ICPIC) was established in 1985. ICPIC continues to sponsor\nan international conference every other year, with hosts including\nAustralia, Austria, Brazil, England, Mexico, Spain (twice), and\nTaiwan.\n\nEven after the passing of IAPC pioneers Matthew Lipman (2010) and Ann\nMargaret Sharp (2011), now led by Maughn Gregory and others, IAPC\nretains a strong presence in ICPIC. However, many ICPIC members now\nhave established their own institutional structures and have developed\ncenters, associations, and programs. In North America, there is the\nNorth American Association of Community of Inquiry (NAACI), which\ngathers every other year (years when ICPIC is not meeting). With\ninitial support from the American Philosophical Association\u2019s\nPre-College Philosophy Committee, PLATO (Philosophy Learning and\nTeaching Organization) was formed. Now a non-profit organization\nsupported by the Squire Family Foundation, PLATO sponsors annual\nmeetings, and in 2022 the University of Washington Center for\nPhilosophy for Children and PLATO were joined. PLATO also sponsors two\nperiodicals: Questions and the online Precollege\nPhilosophy and Public Practice. Australia and New Zealand are\norganized under the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools\nAssociations (FAPSA), which meets annually and publishes Journal\nfor Philosophy in Schools as its official journal (Burgh and\nThornton, 2016). In 1992 the Society for the Advancement of\nPhilosophical Enquiry and Reflection in Education (SAPERE) was\nestablished in Oxford, England. In 2007 England\u2019s Philosophy\nFoundation was established (Worley, 2011). Since 2005, the journal\nPhilosophy and Childhood has been sponsored by ICPIC and the\ngraduate program in education at the State University of Rio De\nJaneiro (UERJ). These organizations, along with many other centers and\nexperienced practitioners around the world, continue to support\ntraining programs for teachers that enable them to introduce thousands\nof children to philosophy, both inside and outside regular classrooms.\n\n\nAlthough there is continued use of IAPC materials, recent years have\nbeen marked by a proliferation of alternative teaching resources and\nways of engaging children in philosophical discussions. For years\nGareth Matthews contributed reviews of children\u2019s stories to\nThinking, then IAPC\u2019s official journal (even though\nIAPC\u2019s own teaching materials made no use of other\nchildren\u2019s literature). This inspired Tom Wartenberg (2009,\n2013) to develop his highly successful pre-college philosophy program\nat Mt. Holyoke College (MA), a prize winning program that is built\naround classic children\u2019s stories. His website offers a wealth\nof materials on children\u2019s literature that are designed to\nprovide guidance for those wishing to pursue philosophy with children.\nKaren Murris was an early objector to Lipman\u2019s resistance to\nusing illustrated materials (Morris, 1992). She and Johana Haynes\noffer a detailed account of the philosophical importance of picture\nbooks (Murris and Haynes, 2012 and Murris, 2016). Peter Worley, head\nof England\u2019s Philosophy Foundation has written several\nstimulating books for teachers and students that make no use of IAPC\nmaterials. Australia\u2019s Phil Cam has assembled a variety of\nstories suitable for philosophical use with children. In short, there\nis a rapidly growing list of resources that show great promise for\nengaging children in philosophical discussions. (See, for example,\nDeHaan et al. 1995; Fisher 1998; Keen 1997; Lewis and Chandley 2012;\nLone 2012 & 2021; McCall 2009; Murris 1992, 2016; Sprod 2001, and\nWhite 2000). Questions: Philosophy for Young People, a\nperiodical sponsored by the American Philosophical Association\u2019s\nPre-College Philosophy Committee, features young people\u2019s\nwritings on special philosophical topics. The first issue (Spring\n2001) focused on children\u2019s rights.\n\nFortunately, the internet makes it possible to keep up reasonably well\nwith the latest developments around the world and communicate quickly\nwith other educators interested in Philosophy for Children.\nUnfortunately, many of these websites seem to be short-lived. However,\nsee the Internet Resources section below for a list of websites that\nare reliable and which provide links to other useful sites.\n",
