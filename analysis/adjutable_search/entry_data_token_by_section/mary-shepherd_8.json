    "main_text": "Mind, body, and self || Minds and bodies\n4.2 Selves\n\nAccording to Shepherd, we are individual capacities for sensation in\ngeneral (EPEU [2020: 14, 42)] who use \u201cI\u201d to refer to a\ncapacity external to all the sensations of which we are conscious\n(EPEU: 56\u20137). Although Boyle (2020: 105) is right that it seems\nreasonable that \u201cI\u201d refers to oneself, Shepherd wants to\nsay a self is a much more complex entity, an enduring object\nwith physical and psychological powers that mixes with other\nobjects with the result that various feelings, thoughts, bodily\nmotions, and mechanical interactions with external objects are\nregistered in it. A self comprises particular sensations including\nconsciousness of its continued existence, that is the feeling of the\ncontinued existence of its mind and its body. Consciousness of the\nformer is analyzed as, first, the sensation of the idea of the\ncontinually existing (partial) cause of sensations and, second, \nconsciousness of the power to remember previous sensations, i.e. the\nfeeling of the power to unite a present sensation with the idea of a\npast sensation (mass of qualities) and the passage of time (EPEU\n[2020: 98, 153\u2013154, 133). Consciousness of the continued\nexistence of the body is the sense of the extension of the body and\nits being sufficient to sustain the powers of life and consciousness,\n\u201cespecially those which determine the union of memory with sense\u201d\n(EPEU [2020: 153\u2013154). The upshot is that our belief that we can\nremember our previous mental states gives us the sense of our identity\nover time. Shepherd offers no account of personal identity as such,\nbut she concludes: \u201cidentity, therefore, has nothing to do with\nsameness of particles\u201d, or physical constituents of the self. It\nis not incorrect to say the sense of identity depends on the power of\nmemory, but more fundamentally, it depends on the eternality of an\nindividual human mind (compare LoLordo (forthcoming)).\n\nWhat happens to an individual mind when its present body dies? The\nindividual mind is immortal, but it is uncertain whether it will\nremain dormant, \u201clost in the eternal ocean of mind\u201d or\n\u201cretain its individual consciousness of personality\u201d (EPEU\n[2020: 378]), In the latter case, it may mix with some matter to form\nthe cause of new sensations and sustain the power to unite ideas of\nmemory with its present sensations or it may mix with some other sort\nof entity to produce sensations detached from memory; even now we use\nknowledge when we have forgotten how we got it (see LoLordo\n(forthcoming) for a more detailed discussion). Although Shepherd\nmentions analogies that make it probable that memory and personality\nwill be restored, she finds philosophy can go no further than that\n(EPEU [2020: 379\u201388]).\n",
