    "main_text": "Three Primary Eschatological Views || Postulating a Final and Irreversible Division within the Human Race\n1.1 Postulating a Final and Irreversible Division within the Human Race\n\nSome may already have observed that the third proposition in our\ninconsistent triad, namely\n\nSome humans will never be reconciled to God and will therefore\nremain separated from the divine nature forever,\n\n\nis fairly unspecific concerning the fate of the wicked and the import\nof separation from God. For if we think of such separation as a state\nof being estranged or alienated from God, or if we think of it as\nsimply the absence of a loving union with God, then (3) is equally\nconsistent with many different conceptions of hell, some arguably\nmilder than others. It is equally consistent, for example, with the\nidea that hell is a realm where the wicked receive retribution in the\nform of everlasting torment, with the idea that they will simply be\nannihilated in the end, with the idea that they create their own hell\nby rejecting God, and with the idea that God will simply make them as\ncomfortable as possible in hell even as God graciously limits the harm\nthey can do to each other (see Stump 1986). This lack of specificity\nis by design. For however one understands the fate of those who\nsupposedly remain separated from God forever, such a fate\nwill entail something like (3). Alternatively, anyone who rejects (3)\nwill likewise reject the idea of everlasting torment as well as any of\nthe supposedly milder conceptions of an everlasting separation from\nGod.\n\nNow when the Fifth General Council of the Christian church condemned\nthe doctrine of universal reconciliation in 553 CE, it did not,\nstrictly speaking, commit the institutional church of that day to a\ndoctrine of everlasting conscious torment in hell. But it did commit\nthe church to a final and irreversible division within the human race\nbetween those who will be saved, on the one hand, and those who will\nbe hopelessly lost forever, on the other. So anyone who accepted the\nCouncil\u2019s decision on this point, as most major theologians over\nthe subsequent thousand years did, inevitably confronted an obvious\nquestion. If there is to be such a final and irreversible division\nwithin the human race, just what accounts for it? According to the\nAugustinians, the explanation lies in the mystery of God\u2019s\nfreedom to extend the divine love and mercy to a limited elect and to\nwithhold it from the rest of humanity; but according to the Arminians,\nthe explanation lies in our human free choices. Thanks to God\u2019s\ngrace, we ultimately determine our own destiny in heaven or\nhell. \n\nThese two very different explanations for a final and irrevocable\ndivision within the human race, where some end up in heaven and others\nin hell, also reflect profound disagreements over the nature of divine\ngrace. Because the Augustinians hold that, in our present condition at\nleast, God owes us nothing, they also believe that the grace God\nconfers upon a limited elect is utterly gratuitous and supererogatory.\nAs John Calvin put it, \u201cFor as Jacob, deserving nothing by good\nworks, is taken into grace, Esau, as yet undefiled by any crime, is\nhated\u201d (Calvin 1960, Bk. III, Ch. XXIII, sec. 12). But the\nArminians reject such a doctrine as inherently unjust; it is simply\nunjust, they insist, for God to do for some, namely the elect, what\nGod refuses to do for others, particularly since the elect have done\nnothing to deserve their special treatment. The Arminians therefore\nhold that God offers his grace to all human beings, though\nmany are those who freely reject it and eventually seal their fate in\nhell forever. But for their part, the Augustinians counter that this\nArminian explanation in terms of human free will contradicts St.\nPaul\u2019s clear teaching that salvation is wholly a matter of\ngrace: \u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith,\u201d\nPaul declared, \u201cand this [the faith] is not your own doing; it\nis the gift of God\u2014not the result of works, so that no one may\nboast\u201d (Eph. 2:8\u20139). The Augustinians also challenge the\nArminians with the following question: if the ultimate difference\nbetween the saved and the lost lies in the superior free choices that\nthe saved have made during their earthly lives, then why\nshouldn\u2019t they take credit for this difference or even boast\nabout it? Why shouldn\u2019t they say, \u201cWell, at least\nI\u2019m not as bad as those miserable people in hell who were so\nstupid as to have freely rejected the grace that God offers to\nall.\u201d\n\nA Christian universalist, of course, might insist that the\nAugustinians and the Arminians are both right in their respective\ncriticisms of each other.\n",
