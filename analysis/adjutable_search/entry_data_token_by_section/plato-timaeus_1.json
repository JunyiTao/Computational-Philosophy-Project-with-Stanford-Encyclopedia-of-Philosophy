    "main_text": "An Interpretive Question\n2. An Interpretive Question\n\nEver since Aristotle rejected the cosmology of the Timaeus on\nthe ground that it required not just a beginning of the universe in\ntime, but a beginning of time itself (Physics\n251b14\u201326), defenders of the dialogue\u2014perhaps wishing\nto neutralize Aristotle\u2019s critique while conceding that the\nassumption of a beginning of time is problematic\u2014have claimed\nthat the creation story is not to be read literally, but\n metaphorically.[5]\n This metaphorical reading of the dialogue became the prevailing\n(though not exclusive) view among Platonists, from the Old Academy of\nPlato\u2019s immediate successors to Plotinus (third cent. CE). The\nquestion of how literally the creation story is to be interpreted\nremains an intriguing one that continues to interest (and divide)\nscholars to this day: if we follow the metaphorical interpretation, we\nwill read the account not as a process by which an intelligent\nCraftsman put the world together at some time in the past, but as a\nstatement of the principles that underlie the universe at all times of\nits existence. Key questions raised by this issue include the\nfollowing: (1) Is Intellect (personified by the Craftsman) literally\nan intelligent agent of some sort, an entity that is ontologically\ndistinct from both the model and its copy, or can the Craftsman be\nidentified with some aspect of either the copy or the model\u2014the\nworld soul, for example, or one or other of the forms\u2014and thus\nbe reducible to something else? (On this question, see more below,\nunder \u201cTeleology.\u201d) (2) How do we understand the relation\nof the \u201cpre-cosmic\u201d state of the universe to its finished\nstate? The account posits that pre-cosmic state \u201cbefore\u201d\nthe creative process by which the ordered universe comes into being.\nBut if there is no time apart from the measured celestial motions, how\nis that \u201cbefore\u201d to be understood? (3) If the creation\nstory is read literally, is it consistent with Plato\u2019s views on\nrelated subjects set forth in other dialogues?\n [6]\n",
