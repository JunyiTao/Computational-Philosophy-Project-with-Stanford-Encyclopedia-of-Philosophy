Semantics for Relevant Implication\n\nOur exposition of relevant logic is backwards to most found in the\nliterature We will begin, rather than end, with the semantics, since\nmost philosophers at present are semantically inclined.\n\nThe semantics that is presented here is the ternary relation semantics\ndue to Richard Routley and Robert K. Meyer. This semantics is a\ndevelopment of Alasdair Urquhart\u2019s \u201csemilattice\nsemantics\u201d (Urquhart 1972). There is a similar semantics, due to\nKit Fine, that was developed at the same time as the Routley-Meyer\ntheory (Fine 1974). And there is an algebraic semantics due to\nJ. Michael Dunn. Urquhart\u2019s, Fine\u2019s, and Dunn\u2019s\nmodels are very interesting in their own right, but we do not have\nroom to discuss them here.\n\nThe idea behind the ternary relation semantics is rather simple.\nConsider C.I. Lewis\u2019 attempt to avoid the paradoxes of material\nimplication. He added a new connective to classical logic, that of\nstrict implication. In post-Kripkean semantic terms, \\(A \\prurel B\\)\nis true at a world \\(w\\) if and only if for all \\(w'\\) such that\n\\(w'\\) is accessible to \\(w\\), either \\(A\\) fails in \\(w'\\) or \\(B\\)\nobtains there. Now, in Kripke\u2019s semantics for modal logic, the\naccessibility relation is a binary relation. It holds between pairs of\nworlds. Unfortunately, from a relevant point of view, the theory of\nstrict implication is still irrelevant. That is, we still make valid\nformulae like \\(p \\prurel (q \\prurel q)\\). We can see quite\neasily that the Kripke truth condition forces this formula on us.\n\nLike the semantics of modal logic, the semantics of relevance logic\nrelativises truth of formulae to worlds. But Routley and Meyer go\nmodal logic one better and use a three-place relation on worlds. This\nallows there to be worlds at which \\(q \\rightarrow q\\) fails\nand that in turn allows worlds at which \\(p \\rightarrow(q \\rightarrow q)\\) fails. Their truth condition for \\(\\rightarrow\\) on this\nsemantics is the following:\n\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is true at a world \\(a\\) if and only\nif for all worlds \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) such that \\(Rabc\\)\n\\((R\\) is the accessibility relation) either \\(A\\) is false\nat \\(b\\) or \\(B\\) is true at \\(c\\).\n\n\nFor people new to the field it takes some time to get used to this\ntruth condition. But with a little work it can be seen to be just a\ngeneralisation of Kripke\u2019s truth condition for strict implication\n(just set \\(b = c\\)).\n\nThe ternary relation semantics can be adapted to be a semantics for a\nwide range of logics. Placing different constraints on the relation\nmakes valid different formulae and inferences. For example, if we\nconstrain the relation so that \\(Raaa\\) holds for all worlds\n\\(a\\), then we make it true that if \\((A \\rightarrow B) \\amp A\\) is true at a world, then \\(B\\) is\nalso true there. Given other features of the Routley-Meyer semantics,\nthis makes the thesis \\(((A \\rightarrow B) \\amp A) \\rightarrow B\\) valid. If we make the ternary relation\nsymmetrical in its first two places, that is, we constrain it so that,\nfor all worlds \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\), if\n\\(Rabc\\) then \\(Rbac\\), then we make valid the thesis\n\\(A \\rightarrow ((A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow B)\\).\n\nThe ternary accessibility relation needs a philosophical\ninterpretation in order to give relevant implication a real meaning on\nthis semantics. Recently there have been several interpretations\ndeveloped based on theories of information.\n\nOne interpretation is suggested in Jon Barwise (1993) and developed in\nRestall (1996). On this view, worlds are taken to be\ninformation-theoretic \u201csites\u201d and \u201cchannels\u201d.\nA site is a context in which information is received and a channel is\na conduit through which information is transferred. Thus, for example,\nwhen the BBC news appears on the television in my living room, we can\nconsider the living room to be a site and the wires, satellites, and\nso on, that connect my television to the studio in London to be a\nchannel. Using channel theory to interpret the Routley-Meyer\nsemantics, we take \\(Rabc\\) to mean that \\(a\\) is an\ninformation-theoretic channel between sites \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\nThus, we take \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) to be true at \\(a\\) if\nand only if, whenever \\(a\\) connects a site \\(b\\) at which\n\\(A\\) obtains to a site \\(c, B\\) obtains at\n\\(c\\).\n\nSimilarly, Mares (1997) uses a theory of information due to David\nIsrael and John Perry (1990). In addition to other information a world\ncontains informational links, such as laws of nature, conventions, and\nso on. For example, a Newtonian world will contain the information\nthat all matter attracts all other matter. In information-theoretic\nterms, this world contains the information that two things\u2019 being\nmaterial carries the information that they attract each other. On this\nview, \\(Rabc\\) if and only if, according to the links in\n\\(a\\), all the information carried by what obtains in \\(b\\)\nis contained in \\(c\\). Thus, for example, if \\(a\\) is a\nNewtonian world and the information that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nmaterial is contained in \\(b\\), then the information that\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) attract each other is contained in\n\\(c\\).\n\nAnother interpretation is developed in Mares (2004). This\ninterpretation takes the Routley-Meyer semantics to be a formalisation\nof the notion of \u201csituated implication\u201d. This\ninterpretation takes the \u201cworlds\u201d of the Routley-Meyer\nsemantics to be situations. A situation is a perhaps partial\nrepresentation of the universe. The information contained in two\nsituations, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) might allow us to infer further\ninformation about the universe that is contained in neither situation.\nThus, for example, suppose in our current situation that we have the\ninformation contained in the laws of the theory of general relativity\n(this is Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity). Then we hypothesise a\nsituation in which we can see a star moving in an ellipse. Then, on\nthe basis of the information that we have and the hypothesised\nsituation, we can infer that there is a situation in which there is a\nvery heavy body acting on this star.\n\nWe can model situated inference using a relation \\(I\\) (for\n\u201cimplication\u201d). Then we have \\(IabP\\), where\n\\(P\\) is a proposition, if and only if the information in\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) together license the inference to there\nbeing a situation in which \\(P\\) holds. We can think of a\nproposition itself as a set of situations. We set \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) to hold at \\(a\\) if and only if, for all situations\n\\(b\\) in which \\(A\\) holds, \\(Iab|B|,\\) where\n\\(|B\\)| is the set of situations at which \\(B\\) is true. We\nset \\(Rabc\\) to hold if and only if \\(c\\) belongs to every\nproposition \\(P\\) such that \\(IabP\\). With the addition of\nthe postulate that, for any set of propositions \\(P\\) such that\n\\(IabP\\), the intersection of that set \\(X\\) is such that\n\\(IabX\\), we find that the implications that are made true on any\nsituation using the truth condition that appeals to \\(I\\) are the\nsame as those that are made true by the Routley-Meyer truth condition.\nThus, the notion of situated inference gives a way of understanding\nthe Routley-Meyer semantics. (This is a very brief version of the\ndiscussion of situated inference that is in chapters 2 and 3 of Mares\n(2004).)\n\nAnother informational interpretation is in Dunn (2015). This\ninterpretation neatly connects the concept of relevance in relevance\nlogic with the pragmatic notion of relevance in Grice\u2019s conversational\nmaxims and in Sperber and Wilson\u2019s pragmatic theory. The idea is that\nthe relation \\(R\\) holds between three \u201cstates\u201d,\n\\(a,b\\), and \\(c\\) if in the context \\(a,\nb\\) is relevant to \\(c\\). This means that using the\ninformation both in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) allows one to derive the\ninformation in \\(c\\). The notion of derivation here is one that\nSperber and Wilson call \u201ccontextual implication\u201d. The result\nis derivable from the information in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but\nnot from the information in either alone (Sperber and Wilson, 2002, p.\n251). There are various ways to think of the combination of\ninformation in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). One that Dunn discusses is\nto think of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as being similar to computer\nprograms and the combination of the two is their composition -- the\nresult of running \\(b\\) and taking the result of that as input\nfor \\(a\\), and then running \\(a\\). This combination is\nrelevant to \\(c\\) if the information produced by it is all\ncontained in \\(c\\).\n\nA different sort of interpretation is given by Beall, et al. (2012).\nIn fact, Beall, et al (2012) presents three different interpretations\nof the ternary relation. These interpretations link the ternary\nrelation with different notions of \u201cconditionality\u201d. I\ndiscuss only two of these interpretations here. The third is a bit too\ninvolved for inclusion in an encyclopedia entry. On the first of these\ninterpretations, a conditional \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) holds at a\nworld \\(a\\) if there is no counterexample to this conditional,\ni.e. a place salient to \\(a\\) at which \\(A\\) holds and\n\\(B\\) fails to hold. This \u201cplace\u201d is not a single\nworld, but a pair of worlds, \\(b, c\\). A pair consists in\na counterexample to the conditional if \\(A\\) is true at the first\nof the pair and \\(B\\) is not true at the second.\n\nOn the second interpretation, the points of Routley-Meyer models are\nconsidered to be both operators (in the mathematical sense) and the\nthings that they operate on. On this understanding, \\(Rabc\\)\nmeans that considered as an operator, \\(a\\) when applied to\n\\(b\\) yields information all of which is contained in \\(c\\).\nThis interpretation makes the Routley-Meyer semantics very similar in\nintent to Fine\u2019s operational semantics. And this interpretaion is very\nclosely related to Dunn\u2019s interpetation (in particular in his notion\nof the combining of information in states). \n\nBy itself, the use of the ternary relation is not sufficient to avoid\nall the paradoxes of implication. Given what we have said so far, it\nis not clear how the semantics can avoid paradoxes such as \\((p \\amp \\neg p) \\rightarrow q\\) and \\(p \\rightarrow \n(q \\vee \\neg q)\\). These paradoxes are avoided by the\ninclusion of inconsistent and non-bivalent worlds in the semantics.\nFor, if there were no worlds at which \\(p \\amp \\neg p\\)\nholds, then, according to our truth condition for the arrow,\n\\((p \\amp \\neg p) \\rightarrow q\\) would also hold\neverywhere. Likewise, if \\(q \\vee \\neg q\\) held at every\nworld, then \\(p \\rightarrow(q \\vee \\neg q)\\) would\nbe universally true.\n\nAn approach to relevance that does not require the ternary relation is\ndue to Routley and Loparic (1978) and Priest (1992) and (2008). This\nsemantics uses a set of worlds and a binary relation, \\(S\\).\nWorlds are divided into two categories: normal worlds and non-normmal\nworlds. An implication \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is true at a\nnormal world \\(a\\) if and only if for all worlds \\(b\\), if\n\\(A\\) is true at \\(b\\) then \\(B\\) is also true true at\n\\(b\\). At non-normal worlds, the truth values for implications\nare random. Some may be true and others false. A formula is valid if\nand only if it is true on every such model in its normal\nworlds. This division of worlds into normal and non-normal and the use\nof random truth values for implications at non-normal worlds enables\nus to find countermodels for formulas such as \\(p \\rightarrow \n(q \\rightarrow q)\\).\n\nPriest interprets non-normal worlds as the worlds that correspond to\n\u201clogic fictions\u201d. In a science fiction, the laws of nature\nmay be different than those in our universe. Similarly, in a logic\nfiction the laws of logic may be different from our laws. For example,\n\\(A \\rightarrow A\\) may fail to be true in some logic\nfiction. The worlds that such fictions describe are non-normal worlds.\n\n\nOne problem with the semantics without the ternary relation is that it\nis difficult to use it to characterize as wide a range of logical\nsystems as can done with the ternary relation. In addition, the logics\ndetermined by this semantics are quite weak. For example, they do not\nhave as a theorem the transitivity of implication \u2014 \\(((A\n\\rightarrow B) \\amp(B \\rightarrow C)) \\rightarrow (A \\rightarrow\nC)\\).\n\nLike the ternary relation semantics, this semantics requires some\nworlds to be inconsistent and some to be non-bivalent.\n",
