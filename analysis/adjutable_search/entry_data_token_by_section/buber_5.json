    "main_text": "Political Theology\n6. Political Theology\n\n\nBuber honed his political theology in response to the conflict\nbetween fascism and communism, the two main ideologies dominating\nmid-twentieth century Europe. His national-utopian thought shared\ntraits with both of these extreme positions and made him, in fact, one\nof the few Jewish personages \u201cacceptable\u201d as a partner for\ndebate with moderate National Socialists in the early 1930s, a\nproximity he himself vigorously dismissed as a misperception. His\npolitical position remained indissolubly linked to his\nphilosophical-theological commitment to the life of dialogue developed\nin I and Thou. According to Buber, politics was the work by\nwhich a society shapes itself. He rejected any hardened ideological\nformations of \u201cthe collective\u201d and thus objected to the\nsolutions articulated on either political extreme. He understood these\nto recognize neither an I nor a Thou in social life. Buber particularly\nopposed the notion that the political sphere rested on the friend/enemy\ndistinction, as theorized by the ultra-conservative jurist Carl\nSchmitt. Buber\u2019s political ideal, \u201ca-cephalic\u201d and\nutopian as it was, was derived from his reconstruction of the ancient\nIsraelite polity as reflected in the Book of Judges. Conversely, it has been argued, his reading of Judges was inspired by the anarchism of Landauer. (See Brody (2018))\n\n\nAs presented by Buber in the 1930s, the primary governing trope of\nJewish political theology\u2014divine kingship (K\u00f6nigtum\nGottes)\u2014represents an answer to Schmitt, whose political\ntheology allowed divine power to be absorbed by the human sovereign.\nBuber resisted this slippage, privileging instead the anti-monarchical\nstrata of the Hebrew Bible. In his 1932 book on the Kingship of\nGod, the biblical hero Gideon from chapter eight of the Book of\nJudges stands out as the leader who, beating back the Philistine\nenemy, declines any claim to hereditary kingship. What Buber reads as\na genuine, unconditional \u201cno\u201d to political sovereignty\nrests on an unconditional \u201cyes\u201d affirming the absolute\nkingship of God. Against the theory staked out by Schmitt, the\nassertion that God alone is sovereign means that God\u2019s authority is\nnon-transferable to any human head or political institution. Thus\nBuber preserves the notion of divine sovereignty over all forms of\nstate apparatus and tyranny. Buber privileged simple, preliminary,\nprimitive, and immediate forms of government, insisting that genuine\n\u201ctheocracy\u201d is not a form of government at all, but rather\na striving against the political tide. No \u201ctheological work of\nart,\u201d the messianic ideal of divine kingship found in the Hebrew\nBible is presented as a reliable image preserved by the collective\nmemory of tradition. Buber maintained that once upon a time the\nIsraelite deity YHWH was, in fact, the\nheretog or warrior-king of the people. But he also knew that\nhe was unable to posit this for certain, and so proceeded to admit\nthat the image reflects not a historical actuality that we can know\nbut only a historical possibility.\n\n\nIn Paths in Utopia (1947), Buber was to plot the \u201cimage\nof perfect space\u201d as one composed of lines that allow no fixed\ndefinition, the zone between the individual and collective constantly\nrecalibrated according to the free creativity of its\nmembers. \u201cThe relationship between centralism and\ndecentralization is a problem which\u2026cannot be approached in\nprinciple, but\u2026only with great spiritual tact, with the\nconstant and tireless weighing and measuring of the right proportion\nbetween them.\u201d A \u201csocial pattern,\u201d utopia was based\non a constant \u201cdrawing and re-drawing of lines of\ndemarcation\u201d (Paths in Utopia, 1996, p. 137). An\n\u201cexperiment that did not fail,\u201d the Jewish village\ncommunes in Palestine (i.e. the kvutza, kibbutz, and\nmoshav) owed their success to the pragmatism with which their\nmembers approached the historical situation, to their inclination\ntowards increased levels of federation, and to the degree to which they\nestablished a relationship to the society at large. Single units\ncombine into a system or \u201cseries of units\u201d without the\ncentralization of state authority (ibid., 142\u20138).\n\u201cNowhere\u2026in the history of the Socialist movement were men so\ndeeply involved in the process of differentiation and yet so intent on\npreserving the principle of integration\u201d (ibid., 145). They\ndiscovered \u201c[t]he right proportion, tested anew every day\naccording to changing conditions, between group-freedom and collective\norder\u201d (ibid., 148). It is not difficult to recognize in\nthis description of the modern Jewish agricultural collective an\nupdated version of the biblical tribal past that Buber idealized in his\nwork on the primitive Israelite polity of the age of the biblical\njudges.\n",
