    "main_text": "Homo Economicus and Expected Utility Theory\n1. Homo Economicus and Expected Utility Theory\n\nBounded rationality has come to broadly encompass models of effective\nbehavior that weaken, or reject altogether, the idealized conditions\nof perfect rationality assumed by models of economic man. In this\nsection we state what models of economic man are committed to and\ntheir relationship to expected utility theory. In later sections we\nreview proposals for departing from expected utility theory.\n\nThe perfect rationality of homo economicus imagines a\nhypothetical agent who has complete information about the options\navailable for choice, perfect foresight of the consequences from\nchoosing those options, and the wherewithal to solve an optimization\nproblem (typically of considerable complexity) that identifies an\noption which maximizes the agent\u2019s personal utility. The meaning\nof \u2018economic man\u2019 has evolved from John Stuart\nMill\u2019s description of a hypothetical, self-interested individual\nwho seeks to maximize his personal utility (1844); to Jevon\u2019s\nmathematization of marginal utility to model an economic consumer\n(1871); to Frank Knight\u2019s portrayal of the slot-machine\nman of neo-classical economics (1921), which is Jevon\u2019s\ncalculator man augmented with perfect foresight and\ndeterminately specified risk; to the modern conception of an\neconomically rational economic agent conceived in terms of Paul\nSamuelson\u2019s revealed preference formulation of utility\n(1947) which, together with von Neumann and Morgenstern\u2019s\naxiomatization (1944), changed the focus of economic modeling from\nreasoning behavior to choice behavior.\n\nModern economic theory begins with the observation that human beings\nlike some consequences better than others, even if they only assess\nthose consequences hypothetically. A perfectly rational person,\naccording to the canonical paradigm of synchronic decision making\nunder risk, is one whose comparative assessments of a set of\nconsequences satisfies the recommendation to maximize expected\nutility. Yet, this recommendation to maximize expected utility\npresupposes that qualitative comparative judgments of those\nconsequences (i.e., preferences) are structured in such a way (i.e.,\nsatisfy specific axioms) so as to admit a mathematical representation\nthat places those objects of comparison on the real number line (i.e.,\nas inequalities of mathematical expectations), ordered from worst to\nbest. This structuring of preference through axioms to admit a\nnumerical representation is the subject of expected utility\ntheory.\n",
