    "main_text": "Statistical models || Statistics without models\n5.2 Statistics without models\nThere are also statistical methods that refrain from the use of a\nparticular model, by focusing exclusively on the data or by\ngeneralizing over all possible models.  Some of these techniques are\nproperly localized in descriptive statistics: they do not concern an\ninference from data but merely serve to describe the data in a\nparticular way. Statistical methods that do not rely on an explicit\nmodel choice have unfortunately not attracted much attention in the\nphilosophy of statistics, but for completeness sake they will be\nbriefly discussed here.\n5.2.1 Data reduction techniques\nOne set of methods, and a quite important one for many practicing\nstatisticians, is aimed at data reduction. Often the sample\ndata are very rich, e.g., consisting of a set of points in a space of\nvery many dimensions. The first step in a statistical analysis may\nthen be to pick out the salient variability in the data, in order to\nscale down the computational burden of the analysis itself.\nThe technique of principal component analysis (PCA) is\ndesigned for this purpose (Jolliffe 2002). Given a set of points in a\nspace, it seeks out the set of vectors along which the variation in\nthe points is large. As an example, consider two points in a plane\nparameterized as \\((x, y)\\): the points \\((0, 0)\\) and \\((1, 1)\\). In\nthe \\(x\\)-direction and in the \\(y\\)-direction the variation is \\(1\\),\nbut over the diagonal the variation is maximal, namely\n\\(\\sqrt{2}\\). The vector on the diagonal is called the principal\ncomponent of the data. In richer data structures, and using a more\ngeneral measure of variation among points, we can find the first\ncomponent in a similar way. Moreover, we can repeat the procedure\nafter subtracting the variation along the last found component, by\nprojecting the data onto the plane perpendicular to that\ncomponent. This allows us to build up a set of principal components of\ndiminishing importance.\nPCA is only one item from a large collection of techniques that are\naimed at keeping the data manageable and finding patterns in it, a\ncollection that also includes kernel methods and support\nvector machines (e.g., Vapnik and Kotz 2006). For present\npurposes, it is important to stress that such tools should not be\nconfused with statistical analysis: they do not involve the testing or\nevaluation of distributions over sample space, even though they build\nup and evaluate models of the data. This sets them apart from, e.g.,\nconfirmatory and exploratory factor analysis (Bartholomew 2008), which\nis sometimes taken to be a close relative of PCA because both\nsets of techniques allows us to identify salient dimensions within\nsample space, along which the data show large variation. \nPracticing statisticians often employ data reduction tools to\narrive at conclusions on the distributions from which the data were\nsampled. There is already a wide use for machine learning and data\nmining techniques in the sciences, and we may expect even mode usage\nof these techniques in the future, because so much data is now coming\navailable for scientific analysis. However, in the philosophy of\nstatistics there is as yet little debate over the epistemic status of\nconclusions reached by means of these techniques. Philosophers of\nstatistics would do well to direct some attention here.\n5.2.2 Formal learning theory\nAn entirely different approach to statistics is presented by\n formal learning theory.\nThis is again a vast area of research, primarily located in\ncomputer science and artificial intelligence. The discipline is here\nmentioned briefly, as another example of an approach to statistics\nthat avoids the choice of a statistical model altogether and merely\nidentifies patterns in the data. We leave aside the theory of\nneural networks, which also concerns predictive systems that\ndo not rely on a statistical model, and focus on the theory of\nlearning algorithms because of all these approaches they have seen\nmost philosophical attention.\nPioneering work on formal learning was done by Solomonoff\n(1964). As before, the setting is one in which the data consist of\nstrings of 0's and 1's, and in which an agent is attempting to\nidentify the pattern in these data. So, for example, the data may be a\nstring of the form \\(0101010101\\ldots\\), and the challenge is to\nidentify this strings as an alternating sequence. The central idea of\nSolomonoff is that all possible computable patterns must be considered\nby the agent, and therefore that no restrictive choice on statistical\nhypotheses is warranted. Solomonoff then defined a formal system in\nwhich indeed all patterns can be taken into consideration, effectively\nusing a Bayesian analysis with a cleverly constructed prior over all\ncomputable hypotheses.\nThis general idea can also be identified in a rather new field on\nthe intersection of Bayesian statistics and machine learning,\nBayesian nonparametrics (e.g., Orbanz and Teh\n2010, Hjort et al 2010). Rather than specifying, at the outset, a\nconfined set of distributions from which a statistical analysis is\nsupposed to choose on the basis of the data, the idea is that the data\nare confronted with a potentially infinite-dimensional space of\npossible distributions. The set of distributions taken into\nconsideration is then made relative to the data obtained: the\ncomplexity of the model grows with the sample. The result is a\npredictive system that performs an online model selection alongside a\nBayesian accommodation of the posterior over the model.\nCurrent formal learning theory is a lively field, to which\nphilosophers of statistics also contribute (e.g., Kelly 1996, Kelly et\nal 1997). Particularly salient for the present concerns is that the\nsystems of formal learning are set up to achieve some notion of\nadequate universal prediction, without confining themselves\nto a specific set of hypotheses, and hence by imposing minimal\nconstraints on the set of possible patterns in the data. It is a\nmatter of debate whether this is at all possible, and to what extent\nthe predictions of formal learning theory thereby rely on, e.g.,\nimplicit assumptions on structure of the sample space. Philosophical\nreflection on this is only in its infancy.\n6. Related topics\n\nThere are numerous topics in the philosophy of science that bear\ndirect relevance to the themes covered in this lemma. A few central\ntopics are mentioned here to direct the reader to related lemmas in\nthe encyclopedia. \nOne very important topic that is immediately adjacent to the\nphilosophy of statistics is \n confirmation theory, \nthe philosophical theory that describes and justifies\nrelations between scientific theory and empirical\nevidence. Arguably, the theory of statistics is a proper part of\nconfirmation theory, as it describes and justifies the relation that\nobtains between statistical theory and evidence in the form of\nsamples. It can be insightful to place statistical procedures in this\nwider framework of relations between evidence and theory. Zooming out\neven further, the philosophy of statistics is part of the\nphilosophical topic of methodology, i.e., the general theory on\nwhether and how science acquires knowledge. Thus conceived, statistics\nis one component in a large collection of scientific methods\ncomprising concept formation, experimental design, manipulation and\nobservation, confirmation, revision, and theorizing.\nThere are also a fair number of specific topics from the philosophy\nof science that are spelled out in terms of statistics or that are\nlocated in close proximity to it. One of these topics is the process\nof measurement, in particular the measurement of latent variables on\nthe basis of statistical facts about manifest variables.  The\nso-called representational theory of measurement (Kranz et al\n1971) relies on statistics, in particular on factor analysis, to\nprovide a conceptual clarification of how mathematical structures\nrepresent empirical phenomena. Another important topic form the\nphilosophy of science is causation (see the entries on\n probabilistic causation\nand\n Reichenbach's common cause principle). \nPhilosophers have employed probability theory to capture causal\nrelations ever since Reichenbach (1956), but more recent work in\ncausality and statistics (e.g., Spirtes et al 2001) has given the\ntheory of probabilistic causality an enormous impulse. Here\nagain, statistics provides a basis for the conceptual analysis of\ncausal relations.\nAnd there is so much more.  Several specific statistical\ntechniques, like factor analysis and the theory of Bayesian networks,\ninvite conceptual discussion of their own accord. Numerous topics\nwithin the philosophy of science lend themselves to statistical\nelucidation, e.g., the coherence, informativeness, and surprise of\nevidence. And in turn there is a wide range of discussions in the\nphilosophy of science that inform a proper understanding of\nstatistics. Among them are debates over experimentation and\nintervention, concepts of chance, the nature of scientific models, and\ntheoretical terms. The reader is invited to consult the entries on\nthese topics to find further indications of how they relate to the\nphilosophy of statistics.",
