    "main_text": "Other Types of Protest || Immigration Disobedience\n2.4 Immigration Disobedience\n\nWritings on immigration and on civil disobedience have merged into an\narea of research devoted to principled disobedience in response to\nanti-immigration policies. One view, which focuses on what individual\nactors should do about immigration, examines various unlawful tactics\nof resistance, including evasion, deception, use of force against\nstate officials, and smuggling (Hidalgo 2019, chs. 5\u20136). Another\nview conceives of illegal migration as a form of resistance to global\npoverty (Blunt 2019, ch. 4), while a third sees unauthorized border\ncrossing as a type of conscientious evasion (Cabrera 2010,\n136\u201343, 165). It is further useful to distinguish transnational\ncivil disobedience from global civil disobedience.\nTransnational (or trans-state) civil disobedience is the\nprincipled violation of a state\u2019s law or policy (a) by\nindividuals who are not citizens or authorized permanent residents of\nthat state, such as asylum-seekers marching from Hungary to Austria\nagainst E.U. regulations; or (b) by the state\u2019s own citizens on\nbehalf of outsiders, such as U.S. citizens active in the Sanctuary\nmovement who provided illegal assistance to asylum-seekers from\nCentral America in the 1980s. Both kinds of cases involve at root the\n\u201cprincipled claim\u2026 that the state\u2019s law is\nmisaligned with the foundational moral principles of the current\nglobal system\u201d (Cabrera 2021, 322). Acts of global\ncivil disobedience, on this view, involve \u201cclaims implicating\nstructural principles of the global system itself, as misaligned with\nits foundational moral principles\u201d (Cabrera ibid.). For\ninstance, when the sans-papiers in France openly protest\nagainst their socio-political and legal exclusion through occupations,\ndemonstrations, and hunger strikes, they may be viewed as engaged in\nacts of global civil disobedience. One last useful category of\nprincipled disobedience that relates to immigration restrictions,\nalthough it overlaps with rule departures and conscientious objection,\nis official or local disobedience, as when local\nauthorities declare themselves \u2018Sanctuary cities\u2019 to\nprotect immigrants by refusing to cooperate with federal authorities\n(Blake and Hereth 2020, 468\u201371. See also Applbaum 1999, ch. 9 on\n\u2018official disobedience\u2019 and Scheuerman 2020 on\n\u2018state-based\u2019 or \u2018political institutional civil\ndisobedience\u2019).\n2.5 Digital disobedience\n\nDigitalization \u2013 access to personal computers and the Internet\n\u2013 has transformed not only our lives and interactions, but also\nour disobedient practices. From piracy to DDoS attacks and from\nopen-access coding to Digital Care Packages (which provide tools to\ncircumvent censorship and surveillance), digital disobedience has\nemerged as a rich terrain for theoretical inquiry. Scholars disagree\nabout the application of the defining features of civil disobedience\nto the digital, e.g., whether client-sided DDoS actions, which involve\nonly voluntary botnets, amount to \u201cvirtual sit-ins\u201d;\nwhether hacktivists such as Anonymous may be considered civil\ndisobedients despite their covert and evasive actions, their penchant\nfor pranks, and their singling out of particular individuals for\ndoxing and retaliation (such as in Operation Hunt Hunter which\ntargeted \u2018revenge porn\u2019 magnate Hunter Moore); or whether\nthe use of zombie botnets in DDoS attacks and the cost of updating\nsecurity systems for the target evinces the violation of non-violence\n(see, e.g., Critical Art Ensemble 1998; Himma 2006; Scheuerman 2018,\nch. 6; Celikates 2015, 2016; Sauter 2016; Delmas 2018b; Z\u00fcger\n2021).\n\nThese debates aside, it is useful to distinguish different kinds of\ndigital tools, sites, strategies, and aims. First, activists use\ndigital technology as tools to organize, document, communicate, raise\nfunds, and make decisions. For instance, Black Lives Matter activists\nuse social media to promote their cause, raise consciousness about\nsystemic racism, and publicize instances of police brutality. They use\ncrowdfunding platforms for fundraising to cover bail and other legal\nexpenses for those arrested. They encourage people to use police\nscanner apps to watch police activity and legal assistance apps to\nrecord encounters with law enforcement officials. Second, the digital\nis itself a crucial site and object of activism. Hacktivists envision\na different Internet \u2013 one that is democratic and democratically\ncontrolled, free, respectful of privacy, and creative. They protest\nagainst the digital architecture of surveillance and control that has\nbeen imposed on netizens without their consent. For instance, a number\nof websites, search engines, and online communities launched\ncoordinated actions in 2012 to protest against the Stop Online Piracy\nAct (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA), whose overbroad scope they\nsaw as threats to online freedom of speech. Third, some properly\ndigital strategies of principled disobedience have emerged, such as\nDDoS actions, web defacement, and hacking. For instance, the No Border\nnetwork created a fake Lufthansa website touting its\n\u201cDeportation Class service \u2026 the most economic way to\ntravel the world\u201d (\u201cspecial restrictions apply \u2026 no\nround trips available\u201d). The Open Access Movement, which\nadvocates for open-source software and an open-source repository of\nacademic and scientific research, combines all three dimensions of\ndigital disobedience: it uses networked computers to organize and\ncommunicate; it seeks to bring about a free Internet characterized by\nthe free flow of software, science, and culture and has developed a\ncoherent political platform in its defense; and it deploys properly\ndigital strategies, such as illegal downloads and peer-to-peer file\nsharing (which is illegal when the content torrented is copyrighted\nmaterial). The Open Access Movement epitomizes a public,\ngeeks-and-grassroots mass movement that not only promotes online\ndemocratic governance, but also enacts it within the movement (Swartz 2008\n[Other Internet Resources]; Delmas 2018b, 79\u201380).\n2.6 Uncivil disobedience\n\nUncivil disobedience is not a distinct category of political\naction, but a cluster concept or umbrella term that can be used to\ndesignate acts of principled disobedience that may or may not be\ncommunicative, and which violate one or more of the marks of civility\nby being covert, violent, evasive, or offensive (Delmas 2018a, 2020;\nLai 2019). Examples include animal rescue, Sanctuary assistance,\nsabotage, ecotage (e.g., monkeywrenching and tree-spiking), graffiti,\nleaks, government whistleblowing, hacktivism (including DDoS attacks),\nguerrilla protests, and riots. These various act-types do not share\nany essential property, besides violating one or more of the commonly\naccepted criteria of civility. Each form of uncivil disobedience must\nbe examined (conceptualized and assessed) on its own. By\nconceptualizing uncivil disobedience, scholars intend to counter the\ntheoretical impetus to make the concept of civil disobedience ever\nbroader to encompass protests that one approves of, but which do not\nfit the standard account and may not even fit activists\u2019\nself-understanding either. For instance, in her 1913 speech\n\u201cFreedom or Death\u201d, the suffragist Emmeline Pankhurst\ndescribed herself as a \u201csoldier\u201d in a \u201ccivil\nwar\u201d waged against the state and defended the use of militant\ntactics, including heckling, window-smashing, sabotage, arson, and\nhunger strikes: radical defiance was the point of such uncivil\ntactics. Identifying some principled disobedient acts as uncivil makes\nroom to focus on their justification. Scholars have defended such\nuncivil disobedience as political rioting (Pasternak 2019), vandalism\n(Lim 2020; Lai 2020), violent protest (Kling and Mitchell 2019),\ncoercive strike tactics (Gourevitch 2018), and direct action (Smith\n2018).\n2.7 Revolutionary Action\n\nWhile a civil disobedient does not necessarily oppose the regime in\nwhich she acts, the revolutionary agent is deeply opposed to that\nregime (or a core aspect of that regime). Revolutionary agents may not\nseek to persuade others of the merits of their position \u2013\ncommunication is usually not their primary aim, although they convey\nthe urgency of a regime change. When revolution is called for, such as\nunder colonial occupation, there is no need to justify constrained\nacts of protest like civil disobedience. Indeed, more forceful\nresistance can be justified as we pass into the realm of just war\ntheory (Buchanan 2013; Finlay 2015). This is not to say that all\nviolent tactics, including terror, are permissible, since the use of\nviolence must not only pursue a just cause but also accord with\nproportionality and necessity (i.e., be undertaken in last resort and\nwith a reasonable chance of success). As will be discussed in the next\nsection, revolutionary activists and thinkers like Frantz Fanon (2004,\nch. 1) and Gandhi disagreed about the effectiveness of violence in\nemancipatory struggles, but not about its justifiability, as Karuna\nMantena (2018, 83\u20134) has shown.\n3. Justification\n\nThe task of defending civil disobedience is commonly undertaken with\nthe assumption that in reasonably just, liberal societies people have\na general moral duty to follow the law (often called political\nobligation). It is on the basis of such an assumption that civil\ndisobedience requires justification. This section examines common\nunderstandings of the problem of disobedience (3.1), before presenting\nprominent accounts and critiques of the conditions under which civil\ndisobedience may be justified (3.2). Whether or not theorists assume\nthat civil disobedience is presumptively impermissible and in need of\njustification, their analyses also articulate the value and role of\ncivil disobedience in non-ideal, nearly just or less-than-nearly-just\nliberal democracies (3.3).\n3.1 The Problem of Disobedience\n\nPhilosophers have given many arguments in favor of the moral duty to\nobey the law (see entry on\n political obligation).\n Despite the many critiques of, and general skepticism toward,\narguments for the moral duty to obey the law, most prominently\nfollowing A. John Simmons (1979), theorists of civil disobedience have\ncontinued to conceive of the practice\u2019s illegality as a hurdle\nto surmount (see Lyons 1998 for an analysis of the endurance of such a\nproblematic assumption). They conceive of principled disobedience in\ngeneral as presumptively wrong because it violates political\nobligation, undermines the rule of law, and destabilizes society both\nthrough example, by signaling to others that anyone can disobey if\nthey feel the urge, and in principle, by expressing disrespect for\nlaw\u2019s authority. They contend that civil disobedience in\nparticular is presumptively wrong because of its anti-democratic\nnature. The agent who violates the outcomes of democratic\ndecision-making processes because she disapproves of them puts herself\nabove the law and threatens the legal and democratic order. Some see\nin it a violation of reciprocity, a kind of political\n\u201cblackmail\u201d and a sign of \u201cmoral\nself-indulgence\u201d and arrogance, insofar as a minority, whose\nviews didn\u2019t prevail, disregards democratic processes and\nimposes on the majority its own view of the good and just (C. Cohen\n1971, 138\u201345; Dworkin 1985, 112; Weinstock 2016, 709; for a\nresponse to the charge of \u2018epistemic arrogance\u2019, see\nHindkj\u00e6r Madsen 2021).\n\nRecent scholarship on civil disobedience has taken what may be dubbed\nan anarchist turn, as theorists tend to no longer approach\ncivil disobedience as presumptively wrong and in tension with\npolitical obligation. Although some theorists still defend the latter\n(Smith 2013), most start from skepticism vis-\u00e0-vis the moral\nduty to obey the law (Brownlee 2012; Celikates 2014, 2016). Others\ndefend a disjunctive moral duty to obey the law or disobey it civilly\n(Lefkowitz 2007); and still others argue that the grounds commonly\nused to support political obligation \u2013 the natural duty of\njustice, the principle of fairness, the Samaritan duty, and\nassociative obligations \u2013 yield duties to resist injustice,\nthrough civil and uncivil disobedience, under non-ideal circumstances,\nand that such duties should be considered among our political\nobligations (Delmas 2018a). Likewise, on a virtue-ethical account,\npolitical obligation can be understood as an obligation to respect\nrather than to obey the law, which can sometimes give rise to a duty\nto engage in civil disobedience (Moraro 2019, ch. 6).\n3.2 Justificatory Conditions\n\nGiven the assumption that people have a moral duty to obey the law and\nthe concern that civil disobedience has the potential to destabilize\nsociety, Rawls famously raised the bar for the justified use of the\npractice, requiring acts of civil disobedience 1) to target serious\nand long-standing injustice and at the same time appeal to widely\naccepted principles of justice, 2) to be undertaken as a last resort,\nand 3) to be done in coordination with other minority groups with\nsimilar grievances (Rawls 1999, 326\u20139). These conditions for the\njustification of civil disobedience, which are critically examined in\nthis part, are closely tied not only to the ostensible need to diffuse\nits destabilizing potential and discourage proliferation of the\npractice, but also to the efficacy and role of civil disobedience in\nsociety (which is explored further in 3.3).\n\nLongstanding Injustice: Why did Rawls restrict the target of\ncivil disobedience to entrenched, longstanding injustices \u2013 in\nparticular, violations of the principle of equal basic liberties? For\nRawls, civil disobedience\u2019s chance of success rests on the\nclarity of the injustice: everyone must be able to recognize the\nviolation as an injustice, given widely accepted principles of\npolitical morality. Racial segregation fell in this category,\naccording to Rawls, but not economic inequality. Rawls thinks that\nappeals to publicly shared principles of constitutional morality (per\nthe publicity-as-appeal requirement) are more likely to persuade the\nmajority and succeed to bring about reform. Rawls, Ju\u0308rgen\nHabermas, and Ronald Dworkin restrict both civil disobedients\u2019\nappeals and their possible targets: they exclude matters of policy, as\nwell as injustices that do not consist of incontrovertible violations\nof widely accepted principles of justice.\n\nCritics reject this justificatory condition because it arbitrarily\nexcludes both progressive but not widely shared conceptions of justice\n(such as cosmopolitanism) and appeals to other principles of morality\nbesides justice (say, regarding the ethical treatment of animals;\nSinger 1973, 86\u201392). And whereas Dworkin (1985, 111\u20132)\nfinds anti-nuclear protest unjustifiable to the extent that it turns\non judgments of policy instead of appealing to fundamental principles\nof political morality, Robert Goodin (1987) counters that the\njustice/policy distinction is flimsy and arbitrarily drawn and insists\nthat civil disobedients should pursue the common good by protesting\ninternational and climate policies. Scholars also include in the class\nof justifiable targets private agents such as trade unions, banks,\nhealth insurance companies, labs, farm factories, and private\nuniversities (Walzer 1982, ch.2; Smith 2013, 55\u20136; Milligan\n2013, ch. 11\u201312; S. Cooke 2016). Finally, observation of past\nand present social movements, including the Abolitionist movement,\n#MeToo, and Black Lives Matter, suggests that, rather than appealing\nto the public principles of political morality, civil disobedients may\nin fact seek to transform common sense morality.\n\nLast Resort: What grounds the widely accepted requirement\nthat civil disobedience be undertaken as a last resort? How do we know\nagents have met it? One position is that, in a liberal democracy,\ncitizens should use proper legal channels of political participation\nto express their grievances (Raz 1979; though Raz grants that\nindividual acts of disobedience can be justified in liberal regimes).\nBut, since causes defended by a minority are often those most opposed\nby persons in power, legal channels may be less than wholly effective\n(Rawls 1999, 327). Moreover, it is unclear when a person could claim\nto have reached a situation of last resort; she could continue to use\nthe same tired legal methods without end. To ward off such challenges,\nRawls suggests that, if past actions, including by others, have shown\nthe majority to be immovable or apathetic, then further attempts may\nreasonably be thought fruitless and the dissenter may be confident her\ncivil disobedience is a last resort (1999, 328).\n\nMinority Group Coordination: The coordination requirement is\ndesigned to regulate the overall level of dissent (Rawls 1999, 327).\nThe idea is that since minority groups are equally justified in\nresorting to civil disobedience when they have sufficiently weighty\nobjections, these groups should avoid undermining each other\u2019s\nefforts through simultaneous appeals to the attention of society and\ngovernment. While there is some merit to this condition, arguably\ncivil disobedience that does not meet it can still be justifiable. In\nsome cases, there will be no time or opportunity to coordinate with\nother minorities. In other cases, other minority groups may be unable\nor unwilling to coordinate. The refusal or inability of other groups\nto cooperate should arguably not affect the ultimate defensibility of\na person\u2019s or group\u2019s use of civil disobedience.\n\nA reason for Rawls to defend this coordination requirement is that\noften coordination serves a more important concern, namely, the\nachievement of good consequences. It is often argued that civil\ndisobedience can only be justified if there is a high probability that\nit will produce positive change, since only such change can justify\nexposing society to the risks of harm usually associated with civil\ndisobedience \u2013 namely, its destabilizing and divisive potential\nand the risk that it could encourage lawbreaking or escalate into\nuncivil disobedience. In response to these challenges, one might\nquestion the empirical claims that civil disobedience is divisive and\nthat it has the consequence of leading others to use disobedience to\nachieve changes in policy. One might also question whether it\nnecessarily would be a bad thing if civil disobedience had these\nconsequences. Concerning likelihood of success, civil disobedience can\nseem most justifiable when the situation appears hopeless and when the\ngovernment refuses to listen to conventional forms of communication.\nAdditionally, even when general success seems unlikely, civil\ndisobedience might be defended for any reprieve from harm that it\nbrings to victims of a bad law or policy. Tree-hugging, for example,\ncan delay or curtail a clear-cut logging scheme and thereby prolong\nthe protection of an ecosystem.\n3.3 Value\n\nThe justification of civil disobedience further articulates the\nconditions for its effective role in society. Far from undermining the\nrule of law or destabilizing society, civil disobedience could\nstrengthen the social and legal order. Civil disobedience can have a\njustice-enhancing value: it can serve \u201cto inhibit departures\nfrom justice and to correct them when they occur\u201d (Rawls 1999,\n336). Equally, it can have a legitimacy-enhancing function, with some\nthinkers conceiving of civil disobedience as \u2018the guardian of\nlegitimacy\u2019 (Habermas 1985, 103). Both ideas deem the practice\nof civil disobedience to be a valuable component of the public\npolitical culture of a near-just constitutional democratic society.\nHabermas even took the state\u2019s treatment of civil disobedience\nas a \u2018litmus test\u2019 for the maturity of the political\nculture of a constitutional democracy: \u201cEvery constitutional\ndemocracy that is sure of itself considers civil disobedience as a\nnormalized \u2013 because necessary \u2013 component of its\npolitical culture\u201d (Habermas 1985, 99).\n\nWhile Habermas\u2019s account resembles Rawls\u2019s liberal\napproach in many ways, its distinctive deliberative strand has also\ninfluenced democracy-based accounts, which defend the justification\nand role of civil disobedience on the basis of its contribution to\ndemocracy. Deliberative democrats (Markovits 2005; Smith 2013, ch.\n1\u20133), republican democrats (Arendt 1972), and radical democrats\n(Celikates 2014, 2016) focus on the potential of civil disobedience to\nenhance democratic legitimacy and to constitute in itself a form of\ndemocratic empowerment. Agents engaged in civil disobedience can\nenhance democratic legitimacy in a number of ways, including by\nputting a heretofore-neglected issue on the political agenda and\nraising awareness about its stakes; contributing to and informing\ndemocratic deliberation; highlighting the outsize influence of\npowerful players and the exclusionary effects of certain processes of\npublic deliberation, and working to make the latter more inclusive.\nCivil disobedience does not only aim to invigorate democratic\nsovereignty, but also can constitute a form of democratic empowerment\nin itself \u2013 an exercise of political agency that is especially\nmeaningful for marginalized groups. Through civil disobedience,\nindividuals discover and realize their power. They work together and\nforge bonds of solidarity. They engage in democratic politics.\nTheorists\u2019 examples to illustrate democratic civil disobedience\ninclude: the Occupy Movement, pro-democracy movements around the\nworld, anti-globalization and anti-austerity protests, climate justice\nactivism, and Campesino movements for land redistribution and agrarian\nreform. Many activists further enact within their movement the norms\nand values that guide their struggles, for instance through radical\ninclusion, direct democratic decision-making, aspiration to consensus,\nand leaderless organizational structures. Some theorists insist on the\nneed to align the means of protest with its aims, by deploying only\npersuasive, non-violent forms of protest that reflect democratic\nideals (Habermas 1997, 383\u20134; M. Cooke 2016), while others\ncontend that civil disobedience can be confrontational and coercive\nwithout betraying its democratic aims (Smith 2021; Fung 2005,\n409).\n\nA third approach to the value of civil disobedience, besides the\nliberal and democratic lenses, comes from the political realist\nperspective. Robert Jubb (2019) critiques Rawlsian accounts of civil\ndisobedience for the binary theory of political authority they rest\non: they take the whole political order to be either legitimate or\nillegitimate, and thereby ignore or deny the possibility that a regime\nmay be authoritative in virtue of having a democratic mandate, yet\nfail to protect everyone\u2019s basic liberties or to treat all its\nmembers as equals, for example. Jubb proposes instead to\n\u201cdisaggregate\u201d political authority, that is, to\ndistinguish between the different forms of authority which a political\norder may possess or lack, in order to make sense of the conditions\nunder which different forms of protest and resistance may be\nappropriate. Other realists criticize both liberal and deliberative\ndemocratic perspectives for their deductive, top-down approach to\nmoral analysis, their quest for rational consensus, and their\nassumption that people can be persuaded by rational arguments alone\n(Sabl 2001, 2021; Mantena 2012). Realist accounts of civil\ndisobedience stress instead \u201cthe ubiquity of moral disagreement\nand the permanence of political conflict\u201d (Sabl 2021, 153).\nAndrew Sabl, for instance, envisions civil disobedience as a properly\n\u2018political technology\u2019 (2021, 165), situated between\nsubmission and revolution, through which agents seek to effect change\nin the basic allocation of burdens and benefits by raising costs for\nadversaries, but without undermining the state\u2019s basic functions\nsuch as its provision of public goods.\n\nFor her part, Mantena debunks the common understanding of Gandhi and\nKing as committed in principle and absolutely to non-violence, showing\nthat their endorsement of non-violence reflected concerns of political\nefficacy. They considered political violence to be\n\u201cfutile\u201d, that is, ineffective for social change and\nlikely to bring about \u201cdangerous and perverse consequences in\npolitics\u201d (Mantena 2018, 84). In Gandhi\u2019s view, violence\nwould cultivate the wrong kind of independence for India and breed the\nwrong kind of polity, amounting to a mere change of personnel in a\nviolent state and generating unstable conditions. Mantena identifies\n\u201cthree faces of nonviolent action\u201d, which we can reframe\nas realists\u2019 account of the triple value of civil disobedience:\n1) morally, civil disobedience is the right means by which oppressed\npeople can regain dignity and self-respect; 2) strategically, it is a\nnecessary means to just and stable political results and future\ndemocratic concord; and 3) tactically, the dramatization of civil\ndisobedients\u2019 discipline works effectively to persuade\nopponents. Recent social scientific research has corroborated the\neffectiveness of non-violence in campaigns of civil resistance, which\nseek to topple dictatorships or colonial powers (Chenoweth and Stephan\n2011; Schock 2015).\n\nMany democratic theorists incorporate political realism in their\napproach as they strive to think about and \u201clearn from the\nstreets\u201d (Celikates 2014), in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach\ndesigned to understand particular contemporary protest movements. This\napproach constitutes a stark departure from \u201ctop-down\u201d\nliberal approaches like Rawls\u2019s and Dworkin\u2019s that require\nagents justify their disobedient protest before engaging in it. As\nAlexander Livingston puts it, many democratic and critical theorists\ntoday seek to draw \u201ctheoretical insights from protest movements\nthemselves around the globe rather than legislating moral guidelines\nfor activist praxis from the sidelines\u201d (\u00c7\u0131dam et al\n2020, 540). Guy Aitchison sees this as a central feature of the\n\u2018new civil disobedience debate\u2019, in which scholars seek to\nrespond to \u2018a new era of political protest and unrest\u2019\ncharacterized by \u201cthe proliferation and intensification of\noppositional political action by groups challenging economic\ninequality, racist policing, immigration enforcement, austerity, war,\nclimate change, financial oligarchy, privatization, and corporate\ndomination of cyberspace\u201d (Aitchison 2018b, 5, 7\u20138)\n\u2013 which theorists tend to be in broad sympathy with. Such\nbottom-up approach also diverges from David Lefkowitz\u2019s and\nKimberley Brownlee\u2019s defenses of a moral right to civil\ndisobedience that applies impartially to all acts of civil\ndisobedience, justified or not (see 4.2).\n4. Responding to Civil Disobedience\n\nHow should the state respond to civil disobedience? The question of\nappropriate legal response applies, first, to the actions of\nlaw-enforcers when deciding whether and how to intervene in a civilly\ndisobedient action. It applies, second, to the actions of prosecutors\nwhen deciding whether to file charges and proceed to trial. Finally,\nit applies to the actions of judges (and juries) when deciding whether\nto convict and (for judges) how much to punish. All three contexts of\nlegal sanctions beg the question of criminal law\u2019s function.\n4.1 Punishing Civil Disobedience\n\nHow much punishment is appropriate for civil disobedients? Is\npunishment appropriate at all? If there is a right to civil\ndisobedience, then, as we saw, it protects people from punishment.\nEven if there isn\u2019t, is punishment indefensible if it sanctions\nmorally justified civil disobedience? The tensions become clear when\nwe consider the criminal law\u2019s function, which is to punish and\nprevent crimes, that is, to tackle wrongful conduct. Unlike civil\nwrongs, which are privately brought, criminal wrongs are public\nwrongs: the polity, not the victim (there may not be any), prosecutes\nthe alleged wrongdoer. Punishment, depending on one\u2019s\noverarching account, serves to: dissuade people from committing the\ntypes of conduct identified as wrongful (Bentham 1789 [1970]);\nappropriately respond to those who culpably commit them (Moore 1997),\nincluding by engaging with them in a moral dialogue so that they\nrepent and reform (Duff 1998); and/or express the community\u2019s\nmoral disapproval of such conduct (Feinberg 1994). So, we may ask,\nfrom the consequentialist, forward-looking standpoint, whether the\nstate should deter civil disobedience; and, from a retributivist\n(desert-based) or communicative, backward-looking perspective, whether\ncivil disobedients deserve the community\u2019s censure (Bennett and\nBrownlee 2021).\n\nIf civilly disobedient breaches of law are public wrongs, comparable\nto or worse than ordinary offenses, then civil disobedients should be\npunished similarly or more severely than those who commit ordinary\noffenses. Kent Greenawalt lays out reasons to hold that civil\ndisobedients deserve the same punishment as others who breach the same\nlaws. First, the demands of proportionality would seem to recommend a\nuniform application of legal prohibitions. Since trespass is\nprohibited, persons who breach trespass laws in protest of either\nthose laws or other laws would seem to be equally liable to persons\nwho breach trespass laws for private purposes. Second, any principle\nthat officials may use to excuse justified illegal acts will result in\nsome failures to punish unjustified acts, for which the purposes of\npunishment would be more fully served. Even when officials make\ncorrect judgments about which acts to excuse, citizens may draw\nmistaken inferences, and restraints of deterrence and norm acceptance\nmay be weakened for unjustified acts that resemble justified ones\n(Greenawalt 1987, 273). What follows is that all such violations,\njustified and unjustified, should be treated the same.\n\nThere also are reasons to believe that civil disobedients should be\ndealt with more severely than are others who have offended. First, as\nmentioned above, disobedients seem to have put themselves above the\nlaw in preferring their own moral judgment about a certain issue to\nthat of the democratic decision-making process and the rule of law.\nSecond, the communicative aspect of civil disobedience could be said\nto aggravate disobedient offenses since their communication usually is\nattended by much greater publicity than most covert violations are.\nThis forces legal authorities to concern themselves with the\npossibility that law-abiding citizens will feel distressed, insecure,\nand perhaps imposed on, if no action is taken. So, notes Greenawalt,\nwhile authorities may quietly let minor breaches pass, failure to\nrespond to violations performed, in some respect, in the presence of\nauthority, may undercut claims that the rules and the persons who\nadministered them deserve respect (1987, 351\u20132). Third, and\nrelated, civil disobedients often invite, and might inspire, other\ncitizens to do what they do. Such risk of proliferation of civil\ndisobedience and, further, of its escalation into lawlessness and\nviolence, may support the imposition of more severe punishment for\nagents engaged in civil disobedience.\n\nHowever, both the models of civil disobedience presented above, which\nstress its role and value in liberal democracies, and the arguments\nfor the right to civil disobedience examined below, strongly push for\nthe opposite view that civil disobedients, if punished at all, should\nbe dealt with more leniently than others who have offended. The\npreceding discussion highlights that civil disobedience is in fact a\npublic good \u2013 a crucial component of democratic culture, in\nHabermas\u2019s words \u2013 and, hence, many theorists defend the\nstate\u2019s responsibility to treat civil disobedients\nleniently.\n\nDworkin argues that the state has a \u201cspecial responsibility to\ntry to protect [the civil disobedient], and soften his predicament,\nwhenever it can do so without great damage to other policies\u201d\n(Dworkin 1978, 260). The government can exercise its responsibility of\nleniency by not prosecuting civil disobedience at all, depending on\nthe balance of reasons, including individual rights, state interests,\nsocial costs, and constitutional benefits. Reasons for prosecuting in\nany particular case are \u2018practical\u2019, not intrinsic or\ndeontological, and always potentially defeasible. In general,\nprosecutors should not charge disobedients with the most serious\noffenses applicable and judges should give them light sentences.\nLeniency follows from the recognition of the special constitutional\nstatus of civil disobedience.\n\nIn this view, officials at all levels have the discretion to not\nsanction civil disobedients, and they should use it. Prosecutors have\nand should use their discretion not to press charges against civil\ndisobedients in some cases, or to charge them with the least serious\noffense possible. Dworkin (1985) urges judges to engage in an open\ndialogue with civil disobedients (at least those who articulate legal\narguments in defense of their actions) and dismiss their charges after\nhearing them, or to use their discretion in sentencing, for instance\nby accepting guilty pleas or guilty verdicts but imposing trivial\npunishments.\n\nHowever, this proposal could amount to letting judges evaluate the\nworthiness of individual civil disobedients\u2019 causes, which would\nnot on its own guarantee judicial leniency. To the contrary, judges\nmight well systematically decide against civil disobedients, upholding\nthe special interests of the ruling class of which they are part. The\nproceduralist insistence on courts\u2019 neutrality avoids this\npitfall, and generally warns against turning courtrooms into political\nforums. Yet the transformation of courts into public fora might not be\nso insidious, and may indeed be part of a necessary institutional\nreform to provide civil disobedients with a platform, perhaps along\nthe lines of Arendt\u2019s (1972, 101\u20132) proposal to treat\ncivil disobedients as a kind of people\u2019s lobbyists (see Smith\n2011).\n4.2 A Right to Civil Disobedience\n\nFor Rawls, there is only a moral right to engage in justified\ncivil disobedience. But many other theorists defend at least a limited\nright to engage in civil disobedience irrespective of a particular\nact\u2019s justification, given the general value of the practice.\nDworkin (1978) outlines what such a right of conduct might look like,\nanalogizing civil disobedients with Supreme Court justices, who test\nthe constitutional validity of (unjust) law through direct\ndisobedience of that law. In doing so, they can make law more faithful\nto the principles of justice and fairness that justify it (on\nDworkin\u2019s theory of law). Some theorists accept the value of\nconstitutional challenges but argue that once the law is found by a\nhigh court to be constitutional and disobedients\u2019 initial\nconviction is upheld, disobedients have a duty to accept their\npunishment and recognize the law\u2019s validity (Fortas 1968;\nNussbaum 2019, 177). In contrast, Dworkin argues that forcing citizens\nto obey court decisions \u2013 including the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\u2013 would mean forcing them to do something their conscience\nforbids them to do, which would contravene the constitutional\nimperative, entrenched in the First Amendment and rooted in dignity,\nto respect individuals\u2019 \u201cright to conscience\u201d and\nprotect their freedom of speech.\n\nThe right to conscience, on this account, thus grounds a weak\n\u201cright to break the law\u201d. It is a right in the sense that\none \u201cdoes the right thing to break the law, so that we should\nall respect\u201d the agent when she follows her conscientious\njudgment about doubtful law and refuses to comply with a law that\nrequires her to do what her conscience forbids (Dworkin 1978,\n228\u201337), but it does not ground a right in the strong sense that\nthe government would do wrong to stop her from disobeying. In other\nwords, on this view, the right to disobedience is deemed to be\ncompatible with the state\u2019s right to punish. Contra Cohen (1966,\n6), Rawls (1999, 322), and others, however, Dworkin does not defend\nagents\u2019 moral duty to accept punishment (1985, 114\u20135). He\nconsiders non-evasion of legal sanctions to be a good strategy for\ncivil disobedients denouncing unconstitutional law and unjust policy\n(justice- and policy-based civil disobedience on his\nview) but denies that accepting punishment is a conceptual, moral, or\ntactical requirement for civil disobedience motivated by personal\nconvictions (\u2018integrity-based\u2019 civil disobedience). For\nthe latter, Dworkin argues that utilitarian reasons for punishing\nshould be weighed against the fact that the accused acted out of\nprincipled convictions, and that the balance should generally favor\nleniency.\n\nJoseph Raz puts forward a different account of the right to civil\ndisobedience, insisting that this right extends to cases in which\npeople ought not to exercise the right: it is part of the nature and\npurpose of rights of conduct that they give persons a protected sphere\nin which to act rightly or wrongly. To say that there is a right to\ncivil disobedience is to allow the legitimacy of resorting to this\nform of political action for causes one opposes (Raz 1979, 268). That\nsaid, Raz places great emphasis on the kind of regime in which a\ndisobedient acts, arguing that only in an illiberal regime could\nindividuals have a right to civil disobedience to reclaim their\npolitical participation rights which their illiberal state is\nviolating: they are entitled to \u201cdisregard the offending laws\nand exercise their moral right as if it were recognized by law.\u201d\nRaz adds that \u201cmembers of the illiberal state do have a right to\ncivil disobedience which is roughly that part of their moral right to\npolitical participation which is not recognized in law\u201d (Raz\n1979, 272\u20133). By contrast, in a liberal state, the right to\npolitical activity is, by hypothesis, adequately protected by law and,\nhence, the right to political participation cannot ground a right to\ncivil disobedience.\n\nA different view of rights holds that when a person appeals to\npolitical participation rights to defend her disobedience, she does\nnot necessarily criticize the law for outlawing her action. Lefkowitz\nmaintains that members of minorities can appreciate that democratic\ndiscussions often must be cut short so that decisions may be taken,\nand those who engage in civil disobedience may view current policy as\nthe best compromise between the need to act and the need to\naccommodate continued debate. Nonetheless, they also can point out\nthat, with greater resources or further time for debate, their view\nmight have held sway. Given this possibility, the right to political\nparticipation must include a right to continue to contest the result\nafter the votes are counted or the decisions taken. And this right\nshould include suitably constrained civil disobedience because the\nbest conception of political participation rights is one that reduces\nas much as possible the impact that luck has on the popularity of a\nview (Lefkowitz 2007; see also Smith 2013, ch. 4; Ceva 2015).\n\nAn alternative response to Raz questions whether the right to civil\ndisobedience must be derived from rights to political participation.\nBrownlee (2012, ch. 4) bases the right to civil disobedience on a\nright to object on the basis of sincere conviction. Whether such a\nright would fall under participation rights depends on the\nexpansiveness of the latter rights. When the right to participate is\nunderstood to accommodate only legal protest, then the right\nconscientiously to object, which commonsensically includes civil\ndisobedience, must be viewed as distinct from political participation\nrights.\n\nA further challenge to a regime-focused account is that real societies\ndo not align with a dichotomy between liberal and illiberal regimes;\nrather they fall along a spectrum of liberality and illiberality,\nbeing both more or less liberal relative to each other and being more\nor less liberal in some domains than in others. Perhaps, in a society\nthat approximates a liberal regime, the political-participation case\nfor a right to civil disobedience diminishes, but to make legally\nprotected participation fully adequate, a liberal society would have\nto address Bertrand Russell\u2019s charge that controllers of the\nmedia give defenders of unpopular views few opportunities to make\ntheir case unless they resort to sensational methods such as\ndisobedience (1998, 635).\n4.3 Accommodating Civil Disobedience\n\nPhilosophers have typically focused on the question of how courts\nshould treat civil disobedients, while neglecting to apply that\nquestion to law enforcement. Yet the police have much discretion in\nhow to deal with civil disobedients. In particular, they have no\nobligation to arrest protesters when they commit minor violations of\nthe law such as traffic obstruction: accommodation of and\ncommunication with protesters is something they can but all too rarely\ndecide to do. Instead, many governments practice militarized\nrepression of protests. Local police departments in the U.S. often\nrespond to demonstrations with riot gear and other military equipment.\nAlso, the British government sought to strengthen public order laws\nand secure new police powers to crack down on Extinction Rebellion\n(XR), the global environmental movement whose street protests,\ndie-ins, and roadblocks for climate justice have brought cities to a\nstandstill.\n\nOne notable exception to the theoretical neglect of law enforcement is\nSmith\u2019s (2013, ch. 5) articulation of a \u201cpolicing\nphilosophy\u201d that orientates policing strategies toward\naccommodation, rather than prevention or repression, of civil\ndisobedience. On Smith\u2019s view, \u201cthe police should, where\npossible, cooperate with civilly disobedient activists in order to\nassist in their commission of a protest that is effective as an\nexpression of their grievance against law or policy\u201d (2013,\n111). Accommodation requires communication channels between police and\nactivists and involves strategies such as pre-negotiated arrests.\nWhile the U.S. often implements punitive and strong-handed law\nenforcement strategies, the U.K.\u2019s current goal (at the time of\nwriting) is, according to one senior police source, to develop\n\u2018move forward\u2019 \u2013 proactive and preventive \u2013\ntactics that are designed to clear the streets of XR demonstrators.\nNeither approach respects anything like a right to civil\ndisobedience.\n\nA constitutional government committed to recognizing the right to\ncivil disobedience would also have to reform part of its criminal laws\nand make available certain defenses. Brownlee proposes two. First,\ndisobedients should have access to a\n\u201cdemands-of-conviction,\u201d excusatory defense to point to\nthe deep and sincere reasons they had for believing they were\njustified in acting the way they did (Brownlee 2012, ch. 5). Second,\nstates should accept necessity as a justificatory defense for civil\ndisobedience undertaken as a reasonable and parsimonious response to\nviolations of and threats to non-contingent basic needs (Brownlee\n2012, ch. 6). As these defenses suggest, constitutionally recognizing\ncivil disobedience does not mean making civil disobedience legal.\nDisobedients would still be arrested and prosecuted, but they would\nget to explain and defend their actions in court. They would be\nheard.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThere have been shifts in the paradigm forms and goals of civil\ndisobedience over the past century, from the suffragettes\u2019\nmilitant activism in pursuit of their basic rights of citizenship to\nthe youth climate movement\u2019s school walkouts and mass\ndemonstrations to demand governments take urgent action to combat the\nclimate crisis. Even so, civil disobedience remains an enduring,\nvibrant part of political activism and, increasingly, benefits from\ntransnational alliances.\n\nTheorists have long assumed that civil disobedience only begs\njustification in liberal, democratic societies \u2013 the best\nreal-world candidates for legitimate states. However, civil\ndisobedience also raises questions in undemocratic and illegitimate\ncontexts, regarding its overall role, strategic value, and tactical\nefficacy. For instance, disobedient protests in support of democracy\nin Hong Kong may not be presumptively impermissible given\nChina\u2019s authoritarian rule. Yet they still beg significant\nquestions concerning the proper contours of extra-institutional\ndissident politics and the justification of uncivil and forceful\ntactics in repressive contexts, including violence against police and\nthe destruction of pro-China shops and Chinese banks.\n\nFinally, whereas theorists have tended to think of civil disobedience\nas generally undertaken to achieve worthy public goals, liberal\ndemocratic states have recently witnessed much disobedience in pursuit\nof anti-democratic and illiberal goals, including conscientious\nrefusal to abide by antidiscrimination statutes and violations of, and\nprotests against, laws requiring the provision of reproductive\nservices and the public health measures enacted to slow the spread of\nthe coronavirus. We may need a different lens than liberal and\ndemocratic theorists have offered to evaluate the full range of\nconservative social movements, counter-movements, and reactionary\nmovements which resort to civil (and other forms of) disobedience.",
