Yet in the collection of essays from whose\nIntroduction this quotation comes and that seeks to explain and\njustify this foundational \u2018dogma\u2019, \u2018children\u2019\ndoes not figure in its index and are barely discussed if at\nall. Whilst children are thought of as human beings and thus having a\nmoral status such that it would be wrong to treat them in certain\nways, it is also thought reasonable that there are things children may\nnot do that adults may. In short, children are humans but not persons\nmorally equal to adults. This is nowhere clearer than when considering\nwhat in law children are permitted or entitled to do as well as\nprevented from doing. In most jurisdictions, for instance, children\nare not allowed to vote, to marry, to buy alcohol, to have sex, or to\nengage in paid employment. Then there are things that should not be\ndone to children because they are children, such as conscription into\nmilitary service. Why should that be the case?\n\nOne very obvious way in which this issue of what distinguishes\nchildren from adults can be addressed is by asking the following\nquestions, Do children have rights? If so, do they have all the rights\nthat adults have and do they have rights that adults do not have? If\nthey do not have rights how do we ensure that they are treated in the\nmorally right way? Most jurisdictions accord children legal rights.\nMost countries\u2014though not the United States of\nAmerica\u2014have ratified the United Nations Convention on the\nRights of the Child which was first adopted in 1989. The Convention\naccords to children a wide range of rights including, most centrally,\nthe \u2018inherent right to life\u2019 (Article 6), and the right of\na child \u201cwho is capable of forming his or her own views \u2026\nto express these views freely in all matters affecting the\nchild\u201d (Article 12) (United Nations 1989).\n\nHowever, it is normal to distinguish between \u2018positive\u2019\nrights, those that are recognised in law, and \u2018moral\u2019\nrights, those that are recognised by some moral theory. That children\nhave \u2018positive\u2019 rights does not then settle the question\nof whether they do or should have moral rights. Nevertheless, there\nare at least good political reasons why one might think that the UNCRC\nprovides an exemplary statement\u2014in the language of positive\nrights\u2014of how children should be treated and regarded. The idea\nof children as rights holders has been subject to different kinds of\nphilosophical criticism. There has also been philosophical\nconsideration of what kinds of rights children have if they do have\nany rights at all. The various debates shed invaluable light on both\nthe nature and value of rights, and on the moral status of\nchildren.\n\nThe question of how the putative rights of children stand in relation\nto the rights of those adults who, arguably, have rights over children\nbroaches the issues of parental rights and responsibilities which is\nnot discussed here.

Children and Rights\n\nIn the background of any consideration of children and rights are two\nmatters: what counts as a child, and what is to be understood as\ncapacity. The latter arises inasmuch as the question of whether\nchildren have rights and, if so, which ones normally turns on whether\nthey have the relevant capacity.\n\nWhat counts as a child and how we should understand\n\u2018childhood\u2019 are interesting philosophical questions. They\nare considered at length in Part I of Archard (2015). (See also the\nentry on\n childhood.)\n We may usefully distinguish a concept from a conception of the child\nas follows: \u2018to have a concept of \u201cchildhood\u201d is to\nrecognise that children differ interestingly from adults; to have a\nconception of childhood is to have a view of what those interesting\ndifferences are\u2019 (Archard 2015, 32). Having made this distinction we should recognise that conceptions of childhood vary across time and\ncultures. Moreover, conceptions of childhood may beg normative\nquestions of why children have a different moral status to adults. In\nwhat follows a child is understood simply as a human being at a\ncertain chronological stage of development. For instance, Article 1 of\nthe United Nations Convention defines a child as any human being below\nthe age of eighteen years \u2018unless,\u2019 it adds, \u2018under\nthe law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier\u2019\n(United Nations 1989; Archard and Tobin 2019).\n\nThe concept of capacity is relevant to questions both of which theory\nof rights is correct as well as to which rights children might have.\nOther terms such as \u2018competence\u2019 and \u2018ability\u2019\nare often used as if they were equivalent to \u2018capacity\u2019.\nHowever, it is important to be clear how \u2018capacity\u2019 is\nused (Cowden 2012). Here it is used as a dispositional concept.\nSomeone has the capacity to do X if they could do X given the\nopportunity and in the appropriate circumstances. It is to be\ndistinguished from an occurrent ability or competence to do X. Thus, a\nmature rational adult has the capacity to make autonomous choices, but\nmay be temporarily unable to choose autonomously because, for\ninstance, on this occasion their mind is disturbed, or their will is\noverborne. The notion of a child\u2019s capacity should not be\nunderstood as meaning that they have it inasmuch as they would be able\nas an adult to do certain things. Nevertheless, the distinct claim \u2013\nthat allowing a child at some age to exercise a given right would\nencourage the acquisition of the qualifying capacity that is otherwise\nlacked \u2013 should be acknowledged and given due weight.\n\nOn the question of whether children have rights and which ones, some\nthink it obvious that children do have rights and believe that the\nonly interesting question is whether children possess all and only\nthose rights which adults possess. Others are sceptical believing that\ngiven the nature both of rights and of children it is wrong to think\nof children as right-holders.\n\nFully and properly to address this issue it is necessary first to be\nclearer about the language of rights and to distinguish several\ndifferent questions. First, we can inquire as to what it is for\nsomeone to have a right, or, put another way, we can ask what being a\nright-holder consists in.We\ncan ask a second question, namely what must be true for there to be\nrights. That is, we can try to specify what have been called the\n\u2018existence conditions for rights\u2019 (Sumner 1987,\n10\u201311). Third, we can ask what the different kinds of rights\nare. Finally, we can ask what the moral significance of having a right\nis, or what weight rights have. With regard to any acknowledged right\nwe can identify it by means of its content (what is it a right to?)\nand its scope (who has it and against whom do they have it?), as well\nas its weight relative to other rights and to other moral\nconsiderations. Not all of these questions are relevant when we want\nto focus on the particular issue of whether or not children have\nrights, and, if so, which ones. However, the first question raised\nabove is especially salient. In response, there are two competing\ntheories whose respective virtues and vices have been extensively\ndebated. In one camp is the will or choice theory (Hart 1973; Sumner\n1987; Steiner 1994); in the opposing camp is the welfare or interest\ntheory (MacCormick 1982; Raz 1984; Kramer 1998). The first theory sees\na right as the protected exercise of choice. In particular to have a\nright is to have the power to enforce or waive the duty of which the\nright is the correlative. The second theory sees a right as the\nprotection of an interest of sufficient importance to impose on others\ncertain duties whose discharge allows the right-holder to enjoy the\ninterest in question. It is natural to think that each theory is more\nappropriate for certain kinds of rights. The will theory fits rights\nactively to do things (to speak, to associate with others) whereas the\ninterest theory fits rights passively to enjoy or not to suffer things\n(to receive health care, not to be tortured). However, the distinction\nbetween the theories of what it is to have a right is not, and does\nnot coincide with the distinction between different kinds of rights,\neven if there are important relations between the two\ndistinctions.\n\nIn this present context one alleged defect of the will theory is its\nexclusion of some humans from the category of right-holders. This is\nbecause whilst all humans, and perhaps many classes of non-humans such\nas animals, have interests that ought to be protected, not all humans\nhave the capacity to exercise choice. Children\u2014along with the\nseverely mentally disabled and the comatose\u2014cannot thus, on the\nwill theory, be the holders of rights. For at least one prominent\ndefender of the interest theory, the fact that children evidently do\nhave rights is sufficient to display the falsity of the will theory,\nthus making children a \u2018test-case\u2019 for the latter\n(MacCormick 1982). Of course, someone who is convinced of the\ncorrectness of the will theory might readily concede that the theory\nentails the denial of rights to children but see no reason to abandon\nthe theory. For her, the entailment is not, \u2018Children have\nrights. Therefore, the will theory is false\u2019. It is, \u2018The\nwill theory is true. Therefore, children cannot have\nrights\u2019.\n\nThe following seven\nstatements set out the arguments for the conclusions of the two\ncompeting theories of rights. 1 \u2013 4 sets out the argument for\nthe negative conclusion of the will theory, and 5 \u2013 7 set out the\nargument for the positive conclusion of the interest theory:\n\nRights are protected choices.\nOnly those capable of exercising choices\ncan be right-holders.\nChildren are incapable of exercising\nchoice.\nChildren are not right-holders.\nAdults have duties to protect the\nimportant interests of children.\nRights and duties are correlative.\nChildren are right-holders.\n\n\n(6) states an important view held by many that for each and every\nright there is a correlative duty. To say that I have a right to\nsomething is to say that someone else has a duty to me in respect of\nthat thing. There may of course be some kinds of duties which do not\ncorrelate with any rights. Indeed, some critics of children\u2019s\nrights will concede that adults have duties to protect important\ninterests of children but deny that these interests correlate with\nrights held by children. (7) is thus true only insofar as the duties\nadults have in respect of children are such that they do correlate\nwith rights held by children.\n\n(3) is obviously a contestable, and contested, claim. But insofar as\nchildren cannot exercise choice and are required to do so on the will\ntheory if they are to have rights, then it follows that they cannot\nhave rights.\n\nThe upshot of setting the two theories out in this fashion is as\nfollows: either children have rights, in which case the will theory\ncannot be true; or they do not, in which case that theory could be\ntrue.\n\nHowever, a will theorist who did not want to deny that children have\nrights might resist affirming (2). This could be done by accepting\nthat children are themselves incapable of exercising choice but\nallowing that children might have representatives or proxies, such as\nmost obviously their parents or guardians, who could exercise the\nchoices on behalf of the children. The representatives would choose\nfor the children as the children would choose if they were capable of\nchoosing for themselves. This proxy exercise of choice would take\nplace only during the period when the children were incapable of\nexercising choice and in acknowledgment of the fact that the children\nwill eventually be capable of exercising their own choices. The will\ntheory\u2019s most prominent defender (Hart 1973, 184 n.86) makes\njust such a modification of the will theory in respect of\nchildren.\n\nNow such a modification must meet a number of challenges. First, how\nshould the representatives be selected? Should those empowered to act\nas representatives be those who are most likely to choose as the\nchildren would choose if capable, or are there are other independent\ngrounds on which they are selected\u2014such as, most obviously, that\nthey are the child\u2019s parents? Second, if we think of such\nrepresentation as a trust whose beneficiaries are children and whose\ntrustees are the adults choosing for children, are the terms of the\ntrust sufficiently clear and determinate? Is it, for instance,\nperspicuous and evident what a child would choose if capable of\nchoosing? Note that the criterion is not what is in the best interests\nof the child for, consistent with the will theory, we must appeal to\nchoices rather than interests. It is sometimes difficult to say what\nsome adult who cannot currently choose\u2014because she is, for\ninstance, temporarily comatose\u2014would choose if able. It is\nimpossibly hard in the case of someone, a child, who is for the period\nof childhood simply incapable of making any choices. Third, how is the\ntrust to be enforced and by whom? The representative may be presumed\nto have a duty to choose as the child would choose if able. If rights\nare correlative with duties then someone other than the representative\nand the child must be in a position to enforce or waive this duty.\nCould this be the state or its representative?\n\nIf the will theory can meet these formidable challenges, it can accord\nrights to children who are not then a straightforward\n\u2018test-case\u2019 for determining which theory of rights is\ncorrect. Moreover, the will theorist can make two further points.\nFirst, she might accept (6)\u2014that rights and duties are\ncorrelative\u2014but deny or at least significantly modify\n(5)\u2014that adults have duties to protect the important interests\nof children. She could say that the duties that are rightly specified\nunder (5) are not the duties that correlate with rights. This is just\nto say, as all rights theorists will repeatedly say, that rights do\nnot exhaust the moral domain. What we are obligated to do because\nothers have rights against us is not everything we must morally do.\n(6) asserts that for each and every right there is a correlate duty.\nIt is not the eminently disputable claim that for each and every duty\nthere is a correlate right. So, we should, as adults, ensure that the\ninterests of children are protected and promoted. It would not follow\nthat in consequence they have rights against us.\n\nSecond a will theorist might accept (5) and (6) as they stand but say\nthat the rights which correlate with these duties are possessed not by\nthe children but by adults who are in the best position to protect the\nchildren. Thus, even if the duties adults have in respect of children\ndo correlate with rights it does not follow that the rights in\nquestion are held by those whose interests they protect. Indeed, it\nmight be argued that it does not matter whether the rights are\npossessed by those whose interests they protect. Hillel Steiner thus\nasks rhetorically, Does it really matter whether the rights that\ncorrelate with adult duties to children are held by the children or by\nthose who would act as best they could for the children? (Steiner\n1998, 261).\n\nThis review of the will and interest theories has simply examined the\nissue of whether the denial of children\u2019s rights can be thought\nof as a test case for the probity of the will theory. There may of\ncourse be other considerations that tell against the will theory and\nin favour of the interest theory; or the converse.\n2. Critics of Children\u2019s Rights\n\nGrant that on either account of what it is to have a right children\ncould, in principle, be the holders of rights. Ought children to have\nrights? And, if so, what rights should they have? Note that the rights\ncan be moral or legal. Children do have rights in law (under the UN\nConvention most notably). These need not be accepted as moral rights.\nHowever, someone could believe that the best way, on balance, to\nprotect the interests of children is by continuing to accord them the\nlegal rights they have under something like the Convention. Someone\nmight also believe that children should have legal rights but not\nthose they are currently accorded. Conversely, if children do have\nmoral rights, these need not be enshrined in law, although there would\nevidently be a strong presumption that they should. In the first\ninstance, the question is whether children should have moral rights.\nIf they should, then there would be a good case for thinking that\nthese should be legally protected rights.\n\nThose who claim that children should have all the rights that adults\npresently have are called \u2018liberationists\u2019 (to be\ndiscussed in the next section) and include Holt, Farson and Cohen\n(Farson 1974; Holt 1975; Cohen 1980). We can distinguish real from\nrhetorical liberationists. The latter are those who see the demand for\nequal rights for children as a means both of drawing attention to the\ndiscrimination that children suffer by comparison with adults in their\ntreatment and for improving their condition. A rhetorical\nliberationist does not actually believe that children should be the\nequals of adults. Rather, he thinks that claiming as much is the best\nway of advancing their interests. A real liberationist does view\nchildren as the equals of adults. Then there are those who think that\nchildren should have some but not all of the rights which adults have.\nFinally, there are those who think that children should not have any\nrights. Or, put less brusquely, they are sceptical, for theoretical\nand political reasons, about attributing rights to children. Their\ncase is made in three ways. The first is to assert what liberationists\ndeny, namely that children are not qualified, as adults are, to have\nrights. The second is to argue that the ascription of rights to\nchildren is inappropriate because it displays a misunderstanding of\nwhat childhood is, what children are like, or what relationships\nchildren stand in to adults. The third is to argue that,\nnotwithstanding their lack of rights, children can be assured of\nadequate moral protection by other means.\n\nWith respect to the first claim, the question of qualification is the question of whether children have the requisite capacity for\nrights. On the will theory of rights the relevant capacity qualifying\nchildren for possession of rights is that of the ability to choose.\nBut there is a more general issue of capacity that is in dispute\nwhatever theory of rights is defended and that follows from attention\nto the fact that rights have a content. Each right is a right to do,\nto be, or to have something. Arguably, only those rights can be\npossessed whose content can be appropriately attributed to their\nowners. A right to free speech cannot properly be possessed by an\nentity incapable of speech. One conventional way to think of rights in\nterms of their content is to distinguish between freedom rights\n(rights to choose, such as to vote, practise a religion, and to\nassociate) and welfare rights (rights that protect important interests\nsuch as health).\n\nChildren in general lack certain cognitive abilities\u2014to acquire\nand to process information in an ordered fashion, to form consistent\nand stable beliefs, to appreciate the significance of options and\ntheir consequences. They also lack certain volitional\nabilities\u2014to form, retain and act in the light of consistent\ndesires, and to make independent choices. Children are not unique amongst\nhumans in this respect. Those adults who are seriously mentally\nimpaired are also disqualified in this sense, which is of course just\nto say that these adults are childlike. Children are unique in the\nfollowing regard. Not all humans are seriously mentally impaired, but\nall humans were once children. Thus every one of us was, during our\nearly years, not qualified to be a holder of rights even if now we are\nso qualified.\n\nIt is worth distinguishing \u2013 as Schapiro (1999, 2003) does\n\u2013 between two ways in which a child is, relative to an adult,\nincapable. Schapiro argues that childhood is a \u2018normative\npredicament\u2019 wherein the child is in a state of nature, lacking\nany independent will whereby she might authoritatively and in her own\nvoice order her desires. She is an \u2018instinctual wanton\u2019.\nOn her account, the capacities a child lacks are not those of making\ngood choices, but those of making any choices as such.\n\nA child\u2019s incapacity, in the senses indicated above, would seem\nto disqualify them from having liberty rights. Someone incapable of\nchoosing cannot have a right whose content is a fundamental choice.\nIf, as some maintain, all human rights are best interpreted as\nprotecting human agency and its preconditions, then it would follow\nthat those incapable of agency, such as young children, should not be\naccorded human rights (Griffin 2002). On the other hand, it could be\nmaintained that, whilst children lack agency, they certainly have\nfundamental interests meriting protection and thus at least have\nwelfare rights (Brighouse 2002). Moreover, it can be important to\nrecognise that children become beings capable of making choices and\nthat rights may be attributed in recognition of this gradual\ndevelopment (Brennan 2002).\n\nThe second claim that may be made in denying rights to children is\nthat the ascription of rights to children is inappropriate because it\ndisplays a misunderstanding of what childhood is, of what children are\nlike, or of what relationships children do or ought to stand in to\nadults. This claim comes in various forms.\n\nOn one view we should start our thinking about what morally we owe\nto children by specifying our obligations as adults to them\n(O\u2019Neill 1988). There certainly exist what are called perfect\nobligations. These are obligations that are either owed to all\nchildren or to some specified set of children. They are perfect in\nthat it is completely specified whom they are owed to and what is owed\nto them. We all are obliged not to maltreat any child, and parents\nhave a particular duty to care for their children. But then there are\nimperfect obligations which are those of caring for children to whom\nwe do not, as parents for instance, have specific obligations. All\nadults owe these, but they are not owed to all children (how could\nthey possibly be?) nor is it specified what precisely is owed to\nthem. The obligations are imperfect because which children we should\ncare for is not specified nor is it specified precisely what is owed\nto them. Both are left to individual discretion, depending in part on\ncircumstances. \n\nPerhaps then we can agree that we are all under a duty to prevent the\nabuse of children. But clearly we cannot, as individuals, each act to\nstop every child being abused. Moreover what we ought to do\u2014for\ninstance, by reporting suspected cases of abuse\u2014will depend on\nthe circumstances, and also on what is in place by way of particular\ninstitutions and laws to deal with child abuse.\n\nCrucially whilst perfect obligations correlate with rights, imperfect\nobligations do not. This means that anyone who starts and finishes\nthinking about what morally is owed to children in terms of their\nrights is unable to capture what imperfect obligations express. Yet\nthis is to miss much of what is most important about the way in which,\nmorally, we should as adults stand in relation to children. For the\nfulfilment of these imperfect duties of care and concern is what\ncentrally protects and promotes the lives of children as children.\nThinking ethically about children\u2019s lives in terms of their\nputative rights is to misperceive what is of central importance and\nvalue in these lives.\n\nOne possible response to O\u2019Neill\u2019s argument is as follows\n(Coady 1992). She does not deny that perfect obligations correlate\nwith rights. Thus, to the extent that we do have perfect obligations\nto children, they do have corresponding rights. Yet O\u2019Neill\ndenies that imperfect obligations correlate with rights. But why\nshould we think that? The imperfect obligations are fundamental ones.\nThey are not supererogatory, that is beyond duty. Adults must show\nconsideration and kindness to children in general. So why cannot\nchildren claim such kindness and consideration from adults as their\nright? O\u2019Neill does say that when imperfect obligations are\ninstitutionalised\u2014when, for instance there are laws and\ninstitutions specifying who should act and how to detect and prevent\nchild abuse\u2014there are created positive special obligations to\nwhich correspond positive rights. But she adds that the obligations\nof, say, the social worker exceed the positive obligations associated\nwith her job. However this is true of all our obligations, whether\nperfect or imperfect. A parent can have positive, that is legally\nrecognised and sanctioned, duties to her child. Yet her perfect\nobligations to her children are not exhaustively specified by what the\nlaw requires of her.\n\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s argument does not rely on any specification of\nthe content of the obligations that might be owed by adults to\nchildren. Rather it is about the structure of our moral reasoning in\nrespect of children, and the priority\u2014false in the\nargument\u2019s view\u2014that is given to rights. As an argument it\nthus bears some comparison with a view that expresses general\nscepticism about rights in the context of adult-child relations and\nwhich emphasises the particular character of the family (Schrag 1980;\nSchoeman 1980). This view draws attention to the quality and nature of\nthe relationships within a family. These are marked by an especial\nintimacy and by deep, unconditional love between its members. One can\ngrant that many families do not conform to this ideal and yet\nacknowledge that when the family does conform to the ideal it is a\ndistinctive, and distinctively valuable, form of human\nassociation.\n\nWhat arguably follows from this ideal of the family is the\ninappropriateness of asserting or claiming rights. For to do so would\nbe to subvert and ultimately destroy what constitutes the family as\nthe distinctive form of human association it is. Appeal is being made\nhere to a familiar and oft-drawn distinction between two ways in which\nindividuals engaged in a common enterprise or bound together in some\nenduring association can be assured of their beneficent, or at least\nminimally good, treatment of one another. One way is by the\nrecognition\u2014in law or custom or shared morality\u2014of rights\nthat all individuals can claim, or by rules of justice\u2014similarly\nand generally recognised\u2014which provide an assurance of fair\ntreatment. Another way is by reliance on the dispositions or attitudes\nthat the individuals bound together have\u2014spontaneously and\nnaturally\u2014towards one another. Thus, for instance, if each is\nmotivated by general benevolence in respect of all then no one has any\nneed to claim or assert what is due to him as of right or rule. In the\ncase of the family, it is argued, neither justice nor benevolence\nsuffices but love does. Of course children may have rights against\nthose who are not family members (a right, for instance, that their\nschool teachers provide them with information and skills). Some rights\nare held against particular individuals. Others, including the most\nimportant ones, are held against everyone, including parents and other\nfamily members\n\nA further and quite distinct allegation is that not only is there no\nneed for any such claims, but that allowing them to be made will\nerode, and in due course destroy, the dispositions and attitudes that\nrendered the need for rights and rules of justices unnecessary in the\nfirst place. This further claim is an influential one in the general\ncritique communitarianism makes, within political philosophy, of what\nis characterised as a rights-based and individualistic liberalism\n(see, for instance, Sandel 1982, 32\u20135). In the context of the\nfamily the claim is that granting its members rights will subvert and\nbring about the end of the love between them that made rights\nsuperfluous in the first place.\n\nThe arguments considered thus far have appealed to the role that\nrights generally do and should play in our moral lives. A further\nargument considers what would actually follow from granting rights to\nchildren (Purdy 1992). The argument is that we need as adults to have\nacquired certain traits of character if we are to be able to pursue\nour goals and lead a valuable life. To acquire these traits it is\nessential that we not be allowed as children to make our own choices.\nGranting children the liberty to exercise rights is destructive of the\npreconditions for the possibility of having fulfilling adult lives.\nThe central, and empirical, premise in this argument is that children\ndo not spontaneously and naturally grow into adults. They need to be\nnurtured, supported, and, more particularly, subjected to control and\ndiscipline. Without that context giving children the rights that\nadults have is bad for the children. It is also bad for the adults\nthey will turn into and for the society we share as adults and\nchildren.\n\nThe defence of the view that children should not, as the liberationist\nasserts, have all the rights that adults have has rested on the claims\nthat, first, children lack the capacities that qualify adults for the\npossession of rights, and, second, that talk of children\u2019s\nrights does not capture the truth about their lives or about the\nfamily or encourages a destructive permissiveness that has poor\nconsequences for adults and their society. The third step in defence\nof the denial of rights to children is to provide reassurance that\nsuch a denial is not bad for children.\n\nOne can thus maintain that rights do not exhaust the moral domain.\nThere are things we ought to do which do not correspond to the\nobligations we have as the correlates of rights. As adults we should\nprotect and promote the welfare of children. It need not follow that\nthey have rights against us.\n\nTo those who insist that children should, like other historically disadvantaged and discriminated groups, be emancipated by according them rights the reply\n(O\u2019Neill 1988, 459\u2013 463) is that such talk about rights\ntalk misses what is distinctively different about children as a group.\nThis is that childhood is not a permanently maintained status\nassociated with oppression or discrimination. It is rather a stage of\nhuman development which all go through. Moreover the adults who deny\nthat children do have rights may nevertheless also believe that it is\ntheir duty to ensure that the children for whom they have care do pass\nfrom childhood into adulthood.\n3. Liberationism\n\nThe first claim in the defence of the denial of rights to children is\nthat children are disqualified by virtue of their incapacity to have\nrights. Liberationists dispute this. Liberationists can allow that the\nkey to the appropriateness of giving or not giving rights to children\nturns on capacity (Cohen 1980, ix). They will argue, however, that\nchildren are not disqualified from having rights by virtue of their\nlack of a capacity that adults do have. Note that on this view\nchildren are entitled to both welfare and freedom rights whereas those\nwho concede that children lack the latter in virtue of a certain\nincapacity can still insist that they ought to have welfare rights\nwhere such an incapacity is not relevant. There are two respects in\nwhich this liberationist case might be modified or qualified. The\nfirst is in its scope. The liberationist might claim that all children\nare qualified to have rights, or she might claim only that some\nchildren are so qualified. The latter is the more plausible position\nin view of the fact that the very young infant is evidently\nincapacitated. Indeed some liberationists seem to recognise as much\neven whilst they insist that every child should have rights (Farson\n1974, 31, 172, and 185). If the scope of the liberationist claim is\nthus limited it does not amount to the view that no line dividing\nhuman rights holders from humans who lack rights should be drawn.\nRather it is the view that such a line has been drawn in the wrong\nplace.\n\nA second possible qualification of the liberationist view is that\ngiving rights to children will play an important part in their\nacquiring the qualifying capacity. It is not thus argued that children\nare capable now and are illegitimately denied their rights. It is\nrather that they will only\u2014or at least will more readily or will\nat an earlier stage\u2014acquire that capacity if given their rights.\nThe denial of rights to children is, on this account, one significant\nelement in a culture that serves artificially to maintain children in\ntheir childlike state of dependence, vulnerability, and immaturity.\nAgain the qualification can concede that children of a very young age\nare not capable enough to have rights, and will not acquire that\ncapacity even if given rights. Yet it insists that the denial of\nrights to children of a certain age on account of their alleged\nincapacity is simply self-confirming. They cannot have rights because\nthey are incapable but they are incapable only because they do not\nhave these rights.\n\nOne plausible version of the claim refers to the facts of experience.\nChildren, or at least children of a certain age, may not differ\nmarkedly from adults in respect of their cognitive and volitional\ncapacities. They may be as capable as older humans of making their own\nminds up about what to do and be as independent in their resolution to\nact on their choices. But they may simply not have had as much\nexperience of the world as their adult counterparts. Being thus\nna\u00efve and inexperienced in the ways of the world they will not be\nas able, that is as qualified, as older (and wiser) humans are to make\nsensible choices. Grant that such a lack of experience can be\nattributed to a lack of opportunities to exercise choice. If such a\nlack of opportunity is in turn attributable not simply to not having\nbeen around for as long but to a denial of the freedom to make their\nown choices, then there is a powerful case for liberty rights being\nextended, even if cautiously, to these young people.\n\nThere are different ways in which the liberationist claim about\ncapacity\u2014whether qualified or not\u2014can be made. One is by\ndefending a \u2018thin\u2019 definition of capacity. For example it\nmay be said that children can make choices if what this means is\nexpressing preferences. Of course the response is that the ability to\nchoose, thus minimally defined, is indeed possessed by children (even\nfairly young children), but it is not a capacity sufficient to qualify\nfor rights ownership. What is needed for that is more than simply the\nability to express or communicate a desire; what is needed is an\nability to understand and appreciate the significance of the options\nfacing one together with independence of choice. After all, the animal\nwho moves from one feeding bowl to another may be said thereby to\n\u2018choose\u2019 the food in the latter bowl. But the animal does\nnot have a general capacity of choice sufficient to qualify it as a\nholder of liberty rights.\n4. Arbitrariness\n\nLiberationists might move in the other direction and argue that the\ncapacity which purportedly qualifies adults to have rights is in fact\nnot a capacity that most, or perhaps any, adults possess. Thus, it\nwill be said that no adult fully understands the nature of the choices\nshe faces, nor is she consistent in her beliefs and desires, nor is\nshe really independent of the influences of her environment and peers.\nWhether the liberationist urges a \u2018thin\u2019 definition of\ncapacity\u2014which the child satisfies as much as the adult\u2014or\nargues that on a \u2018thick\u2019 definition of capacity neither\nadult nor child qualifies as capable, the point is the same. This is\nthat the alleged differences between children and adults in respect of\na qualifying capacity are not sufficient to warrant the ascription of\nrights to the latter and their denial to the former.\n\nOne way, then, to charge that age is an arbitrary means of\ndistinguishing those qualified and those not qualified to have rights\nis that there is, in fact, no real division of capacities (Cohen 1980,\n48). We should note that this claim can be supported by an\n\u2018argument from marginal cases\u2019, one that has been most\ninfluentially used in the case of animal rights. The argument in that\ncontext is that for whatever capacity is argued to distinguish the\nmoral status of humans from animals there will be marginal cases\n\u2013 some humans will fail to possess it (Singer 1975, 265). In the\npresent context, the argument would be that some older children\ndisplay those abilities that supposedly distinguish children in\ngeneral from adults (and some adults do not display those abilities\nthat older children have). Whatever the merits of an argument from\nmarginal cases the importance of being able to show that some children\nclose to but below the age threshold (such as adolescents) do or do\nnot merit the same treatment as other children is clear.\n\nAnother way to make the charge of arbitrariness turns on the idea that\ndividing lines as such\u2014\u2018any\u2019 lines\u2014are\narbitrary. Thus, either it will be said that this age is the wrong\ndividing point or that using any age is wrong. The first objection\n\u2013 \u2018wrong age\u2019- may concede that there is a better\nage to be used, just as the second objection \u2013 \u2018age is\nwrong\u2019 \u2013 may concede that there is a way, better than using age,\nto mark the division. The initial and obvious reply to the second\nobjection is that age as such is not the issue but rather the reliable\ncorrelation of age with the acquisition of those capacities that\nqualify a person for the attribution of rights. Some liberationists\nmay thus not dispute that there should be a threshold age\u2014one\nbeyond which adult rights are acquired\u2014but think that the\nconventional or orthodox threshold is fixed too late. Liberationists\nmay also simply deny that there should be any threshold on the grounds\nthat there just is no difference between children and adults in\nrespect of their respective capacities for any threshold age to mark.\nThis version of the arbitrariness claim concedes that if age functions\nas a threshold it does so only inasmuch as it reliably correlates with\nthe acquisition of capacities which are necessary qualifications for\nthe possession of rights. In sum, the arbitrariness claim amounts\neither to the denial that the acquisition of the specified capacities\ndoes correlate with the threshold in question or to the denial that\nthere is any age at which the capacities are acquired.\n\nSetting aside this version of the arbitrariness claim, what remains of\nthe charge that \u2018[a]ny line which uses age to distinguish people\nwith rights from people without can be shown to be arbitrary\u2019?\nThere are two ideas. The first is that although the threshold of age\ndoes serve to mark a difference within the class of human beings it is\nbeing human which is important. Or, relatedly, what is being\ndistributed, namely rights, is so important that all humans should\nhave them. It is being human which should make the difference not\nbeing of a certain age. Rights are too important to be denied to some\nhumans on account of their (lesser) age and given to others on account\nof their (greater) age.\n\nThe reply is simple. Being human does matter and it is precisely\nbecause they are human beings, albeit young ones, that children are\nentitled to be treated in ways that non-humans may not. However, it is\nrights that are being distributed and to that end a threshold age does\nmark a significant point. Although having rights is better than not\nhaving them, those who lack rights do not lack any moral status\nwhatever. Children are acknowledged to be humans meriting moral regard\nand yet to be young humans meriting a certain and age specific\nregard.\n\nSome will still insist that a threshold age does not mark a\nsignificant enough difference. A 40-year-old differs greatly from a\n4-year-old. Someone who is 18 years and 1 month does not differ\ngreatly from someone who is 17 years and 11 months. It is\nunderstandable that the 40-year-old should have rights whereas the\n4-year-old should not. But this is not the case for the latter\npairing. This is a version of the marginal cases argument about the\nextent to which real differences between classes are displayed by the\nmembers of each class at the edge of these classes. The reply will be\nthat the criticism concedes a difference between being too young to\nhave rights and being old enough to have them. These differences are\nnot arbitrary. Moreover, a threshold has to be fixed. The fact that\nthere may not be significant\u2014or significant\nenough\u2014differences between the members of the two classes being\ndistinguished at the edges of each class is the price one pays for\nhaving to operate with a threshold.\n\nBut is this price one that must be paid? The complaint is that age\ndoes not always reliably correlate with competence. Thus, using age\nmay risk unfairly penalising some who are in fact competent just as it\nmay risk unfairly rewarding some who are in fact incompetent.\nMoreover, the penalties and rewards in question\u2014lacking or\npossessing rights\u2014are far too important to run such risks. Why\nthen should one not take each individual on her own and determine\nwhether or not she is qualified to have rights?\n\nThe problems with the suggested use of a test are various. First,\nthere is the sheer administrative scale of its employment in such a\ncase as human rights. Second, there is the problem of agreeing on a\ndeterminate procedure for testing. How exactly are we to examine\nsomeone in respect of their competence to possess rights? Third, there\nis the problem of fairness. Any test must not unfairly disqualify some\ngroup of putative rights-holders by, for instance, having a bias in\nthe testing procedure which, in effect, discriminates against that\ngroup. Fourth, the administration of any official test\u2014and\nespecially one whose passing yields such important goods\u2014is\nsubject to the risks of corruption or of misuse for the\nself-interested ends of those administering it. Again, this cannot be\ntrue of the use of age as a threshold. To summarise, these problems\nattaching to the use of a test are large and insuperable.\n\nThe counter-response to consider is that the burdens of any such test\nshould be borne by the state inasmuch as there is a considerable risk\nof egregious wrong \u2013 the denial of rights \u2013 that is run by\ncontinuing only to use an age-based proxy for the existence of the\nrelevant capacity (Godwin 2011, 286).\n\nThe charges of arbitrariness can be argued to be false or overstated.\nChildren do differ from adults in respect of their competence to\npossess rights. A threshold of age may be the appropriate way to\nregister that difference. One should, thus, acquire rights only on\nreaching a certain age. However, two riders to this summary are\nappropriate.\n\nFirst, different rights may be acquired at different ages. After all,\nit is plausible to think that the capacities needed for, and\nqualifying a person to possess, different rights are themselves\ndifferent. More particularly, different rights would seem to require\ndifferent degrees of competence. Liberty rights entitle their\npossessors to make choices, and the matters in respect of which\nchoices are made differ in their complexity, importance, and\nconsequential impact. Those who are allowed to choose require greater\nor lesser amounts of maturity, independence, and deliberative\nproficiency in order to be able to make these different kinds of\nchoice. The decisions to marry, consume alcohol, serve in the armed\nforces, undertake paid labour, vote, buy goods in a shop, travel\nunaccompanied, and open a bank account seem to presuppose different\nlevels of understanding and autonomy. Assuming that these levels are\nprogressively acquired at different ages, it makes sense to accord the\ncorresponding rights not all at once but in stages.\n\nSecond, there should be an ordered but consistent acquisition of\nrights. If children are assumed to display the competence required for\none kind of right, they should not be refused another kind of right\nwhich presupposes the same or even a lesser degree of ability. It\nwould not make sense, for instance, to deny a young person the right\nto refuse medical treatment but allow them to choose to die in the\narmed services of their state.\n\nThe liberationist may make one last move. They may concede that\nchildren do lack the capacities that are a prerequisite for the\npossession of rights. However, they can suggest that children should\nbe permitted \u2018to borrow the capacities of others to secure\nwhatever it is we are entitled to\u2019 (Cohen 1980, 56). Child\nagents would advise their clients with a view to ensuring that the\nchild\u2019s right is properly exercised. However, to the various\nproblems with the use of proxies or representatives, which have\nalready been rehearsed in Section 1, we may add this question, Is the\nchild still free to act or not on the advice given? If the child is\nnot so free, then the role of the adviser is a strictly paternalist\none, supplanting the child\u2019s choice as to what is best for\nherself with her own choice. If on the other hand the child is free to\nreject the adviser\u2019s advice, then the child is free to do what\nshe wants anyway and the role of adviser is otiose and beside the\npoint. One only needs to \u2018borrow\u2019 what one does not have.\nNot using what could be borrowed leaves one with the lack\u2014and\nits consequences\u2014that made the borrowing necessary. On the other\nhand, if a child can distinguish good from bad advice, then the\nborrowing is unnecessary. The child can give as good advice to herself\nas would be given to her by an adviser. But then no adviser is needed\nand this is precisely what Cohen denies.\n5. Children\u2019s Rights and Adult Rights\n\nThose who deny that children do have rights can, as O\u2019Neill\nargues, believe that the interests of children are nevertheless\nadequately protected through adults\u2019 discharging relevant\nobligations. Yet, for some, the value of rights is not adequately\ncaptured in this manner. Joel Feinberg, for instance, believes that\nthe value of a right lies in those who possess it being able to claim\nfrom others what is specified as its content (Feinberg 1970).\n\nIf having rights does have a distinctive and special value in this\nkind of way, then it matters greatly that children can have at least\nsome rights. What might these be? As indicated at the outset, children\nare humans. They have at least the right to life that all humans have.\nNevertheless, children are not thought to have all the rights that\nadult humans do. Central amongst these rights is that of\nself-determination, that is, the right to make choices in respect of\none\u2019s own life. This right is the basis of derivative rights to\nmarry, have sex, choose one\u2019s work, purse a course of education,\nand so on.\n\nMost who believe that adults have rights which children do not have\nmake the cut between liberty and welfare rights. Feinberg\ndistinguishes between rights that belong only to adults (A-rights),\nrights that are common to both adults and children (A-C-rights), and\nrights that children alone possess (C-rights) (Feinberg 1980). Thus, a\ncommon position is that the A-rights include, centrally, the liberty\nrights, and that the A-C-rights include, centrally, the welfare\nrights. To repeat, liberty rights are rights of choice (how and\nwhether to vote, what to say publicly, whether to practise a religion\nand which one, which if any association to join, and so on), whereas\nwelfare rights protect important interests (such as health, bodily\nintegrity, and privacy).\n\nWhat might be included in the C-rights? Feinberg distinguishes between\ntwo sub-classes of C-rights. There are, first, those rights which\nchildren possess in virtue of their condition of childishness.\nAlthough Feinberg does not further divide this first sub-class of\nC-rights, this can be done. There are the rights children have to\nreceive those goods they are incapable of securing for themselves and\nare incapable of so doing because of their dependence upon adults.\nThese goods might include food and shelter. There are, second, the\nrights to be protected against harms which befall children because of\ntheir childlike vulnerability and whose harmfulness is a function of a\nfact that they befall children. These harms might include abuse and\nneglect. Note that some adults might be argued to merit the same\ndegree of rights-based protection on account of their childlike\nvulnerability and dependence.\n\nFinally, there are goods that children should arguably receive just\nbecause they are children. Those who have written on children\u2019s\ngoods do so for two reasons: first, to answer the question of what, as\na matter of justice, is owed to children; and, second, to answer the\nquestion of whether, and why if so, childhood is itself intrinsically\nvaluable (Gheaus 2015; Macleod 2010). Note that goods may be valuable\nto both children and adults, but of especial value to the former; or\nonly of value to children. Candidate goods include play and\ninnocence.\n\nHowever, the most central, and contentious, example is a child\u2019s\nright to be loved. This is not an A-C-right but it is arguably a\nC-right, and indeed is cited by many as a C-right (MacCormick 1976,\n305). Various declarations of children\u2019s rights include such a\nright and a respectable case can be made to meet the various\nobjections normally raised against its attribution (Liao 2015).\n\nIt is standard to classify the rights listed in the UNCRC under the\nthree P\u2019s: those of protection (for example, against abuse), of\nprovision (for example, of education), and of participation (for\nexample, to speak and to associate freely). Protection rights will be\naccorded to children but not to adults inasmuch the condition or state\nof childhood calls forth and requires this protection. Children, along\nwith adults, have provision rights but the content of these will\ndiffer between them because of the form that children\u2019s needs\nand circumstances take. Thus, grant that both children and adults have\na welfare right to health care. In the case of children, but not that\nof adults\u2019, paediatric care and treatment is appropriate. But\nthat fact is no different in its significance from the fact that\namongst different adults the proper form of health care should vary in\nline with their various disabilities, diseases, and circumstances.\n6. The Child\u2019s Right to Grow Up\n\nThe second sub-class of C-rights are those which Feinberg\ncharacterises as \u2018rights-in-trust\u2019 and which he thinks can\nbe subsumed under the single title of a \u2018right to an open\nfuture\u2019. These are the rights given to the child in the person\nof the adult she will become. They are the rights whose protection\nensures that, as an adult, she will be in a position to exercise her\nA- and A-C-rights to the maximal or at least to a very significant\ndegree. They keep her future open. Such rights impose limits on the\nrights of parents and also impose duties on the part of the state to\nprotect these rights.\n\nA couple of things are worth noting about these rights-in-trust.\nFirst, Feinberg refers to these C-rights as \u2018anticipatory\nautonomy rights\u2019, which might suggest that they are only\nA-rights-in-trust. But he also speaks of rights-in-trust of class C as\nprotecting those future interests a child will have as an adult. This\nimplies that they are also anticipatory welfare rights (Feinberg 1980,\n126\u20137). Hence this sub-class of C-rights ensures that the adult\ncan later exercise both her A-rights (liberty) and her A-C-rights\n(welfare).\n\nSecond, there is the question of how open a child\u2019s future\nshould be. Some interpret the demand for an education for an\n\u2018open future\u2019 as requiring individuals to acquire\n\u2018to the greatest possible extent\u2019 the capacity to choose\nbetween \u2018the widest possible variety of ways of life\u2019\n(Arneson and Shapiro 1996, 388). Arneson and Shapiro have pointed out several\nobjections to such a \u2018maximising\u2019 interpretation. It may\nnot be possible to quantify in a determinate fashion the number of\noptions open to a future adult. Furthermore, some fulfilling life\nchoices are only available at the expense of denying the child a\nnumber of otherwise possible choices. For instance, a child\nintensively trained to realise his considerable innate musical\nabilities may be unable to pursue careers that would have been open to\nhim in the absence of such a dedicated education. The following\nfurther criticisms can be added. Requiring that a child be brought up\nto be able eventually to choose between as many options as possible\nmay impose unreasonable burdens on parents. It also seems implausible\nto think that a child suffers if she is denied one or even several\npossible insignificant further options beyond some threshold number of\nchoices. Is it really harmful to a child that she does not learn to\nplay all of the orchestral instruments and is thereby denied the\nopportunity to pursue a solo career in those she does not? Finally,\nsome future options are surely morally base or in some other respect\nwithout value (Mills 2003).\n\nFeinberg does sometimes talk only of the harms of closing off\nsignificant life choices. Yet he does also on occasion employ the\nlanguage of maximisation. \u2018[Education] should send [the child]\nout into the adult world with as many open opportunities as possible,\nthus maximising his chances for self-fulfilment\u2019. (1980, 135;\nsee also 151). However, it seems much more plausible to suggest that a\nchild should have enough autonomy to be able to make reasonable life\nchoices. The preconditions of autonomy are both internal (a capacity\nto think for oneself, to acquire and appreciate relevant information,\nand a volitional ability to act independently) and external (the\nprovision of a range of feasible and valuable options). In respect of\nboth conditions, it is perfectly possible to have a good sense of what\ncounts as adequate autonomy, even if there is no clear bright line\nmarking the point of sufficiency.\n\nClosely related to Feinberg\u2019s idea of\n\u2018rights-in-trust\u2019 is Eekelaar\u2019s idea of a\nchild\u2019s \u2018developmental\u2019 rights (Eekelaar 1986).\nThese are the rights of a child to develop her potential so that she\nenters adulthood without disadvantage. Whereas Feinberg attributes the\nrights to the child\u2019s adult-self, the child holding them only in\n\u2018anticipatory\u2019 form, Eekelaar attributes the rights to the\nadult\u2019s child-self. Arguably, this makes no difference, since\nthe child and the adult are one and the same person. Although this is\na metaphysically contentious claim (Parfit 1984), grant that child and\nadult are merely distinct temporal stages of a single individual.\nWhether each temporal stage of the person has the same interest in the\nchild developing into an adult is a further issue which will be\nconsidered shortly.\n\nHowever, child and adult do stand in an asymmetrical relationship to\none another in a way that does not seem to be true of the different\ntemporal stages of the same adult. After all, adult Smith can now\nexercise her liberty rights in such a fashion that at a later time she\nis not able to exercise them and her welfare rights to the same degree\nas she can now. Smith can, for instance, choose now to enter into a\nslavery contract or to engage in a dangerous sport that risks death or\nserious disability. A child, on the other hand, is denied the right to\nmake choices that will fetter the adult exercise of her rights.\n\nThis can be justified by distinct thoughts. First, a child, unlike an\nadult, simply lacks the ability to make considered choices and should\nnot have liberty rights. An adult can make unwise choices but is\npresumed to possess a general minimal capacity to make choices, which\nthe child lacks. Second, what is done or not done in childhood can\naffect or shape the whole of one\u2019s later life and in a way that\nis largely irreversible. By contrast, an adult is in a better position\nto change the course of her life. Third, a child may be thought to\nhave the formal deliberative abilities to make choices (knowing what is\nto be decided) but simply lack the life experiences to appreciate and\nproperly understand those choices.\n\nFourth, in the specific case of an adolescent \u2013 who is legally a\nchild but on the edge of and at the beginning of adulthood \u2013\nthey may be judged as autonomous but nevertheless at a \u2018life\nstage\u2019 which merits paternalistic denial of choices\n(Franklin-Hall 2013).\n\nNow consider the case of a child who will not develop into an adult,\nsay someone who is suffering from a terminal disease that will prevent\nher living beyond the age of majority. Such a child lacks\ndevelopmental rights. Or rather, she has them, but her circumstances\ndo not allow for their protection. However, she does still have\nwelfare and protection rights whose correlate duties can be\ndischarged. The child has an interest in not suffering harm and in\nenjoying a certain standard of life even if she never lives beyond her\nchildhood.\n\nWhen, for instance, we provide a child with health care or protect her\nfrom abuse we not only thereby serve her immediate interests as a\nchild, but we also ensure that she will grow into a mentally and\nphysically healthy adult. At its simplest, a child\u2019s welfare\nright not to be killed is a precondition of the very possibility of\nthere being a future adult with any rights at all. Even the education\nof a child can be represented as not merely of instrumental worth to\nthe future adult but of value to the child here and now. A child has\nan interest now in learning things and does so independently of what\nthis might later mean for her future adult self. (Coady 1992, 51).\n\nThe child with the terminal illness will not develop into an adult.\nCan we say of anybody that she has an interest, as a child, in\ndeveloping into an adult, an interest that is frustrated by her\nterminal condition? Or is there an interest in only being a child and\nnever becoming an adult? Grant that the child-Q and the adult-Q are\ntwo stages of one and the same individual. Could we speak of a\nconflict between the present interest of child-Q in staying a child\nand the future interest of adult-Q in child-Q developing into her\nlater adult self? The latter interest seems perfectly straightforward.\nHowever, it is at least controversial whether everybody does have an\ninterest in growing up. Earlier cited work on the putative goods of\nchildhood can be used to argue that childhood as such has a value that\nadulthood does not, with the further questions arising of whether the\nformer value exceeds the latter and of whether they can be compared at\nall (Gheaus 2015; Hannan 2018). It has also been argued that it would\nbe better for human beings never to have been born (Benatar 2008).\nEven if this is not a general truth, it may be true of some humans\nthat not growing into adulthood and ceasing to exist is better than\nbecoming an adult. This might be true, for instance, of somebody\nfacing the prospect of a life of unrelieved, extreme pain and misery.\nCould there be an interest\u2014even without such a prospect\u2014in\nbeing forever a child?\n\nSuch an interest cannot be physically satisfied in this world. It\nis satisfied in the fictional world of Peter Pan; but the author of\nthat fantasy, J.M. Barrie, clearly deprecates his eponymous\nhero\u2019s infantile desire to escape the realities of the world\n(Barrie 1995).  If we only mean, by the imagined interest, remaining\nchildish it is hard to see how any individual in our world could, if\nrational, have such an interest. It is one thing to be a child forever\nin a child\u2019s world as Peter Pan is. It is quite another to\nremain a child in our adult world. Childhood is something best\nappreciated by the child. It is also something that needs to be left\nbehind. In the words of Paul, \u2018When I was a child, I spoke as a\nchild, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I\nbecame a man I put away these childish things\u2019 (I Corinthians\n13:11).\n7. Best Interests\n\nIf children are not thought to have the A-rights, and, chiefly, do not\nhave the liberty rights to choose for themselves how to conduct their\nlives, nevertheless they are not morally abandoned to their own\ndevices. In the first place, it is a standard principle of child\nwelfare law and policy that the \u2018best interests\u2019 of a\nchild should be promoted. Article 3.1 of the United Nations Convention\non the Rights of the Child states that \u2018In all actions\nconcerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social\nwelfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or\nlegislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary\nconsideration\u2019 (United Nations 1989).\n\nSecond, Article 12.1 of the Convention asserts that, \u2018States\nParties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her\nown views the right to express those views freely in all matters\naffecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in\naccordance with the age and maturity of the child\u2019 (United\nNations 1989).\n\nSection 9 discusses the right to be heard. This section discusses the\nbest interest principle, henceforward the BIP. The discussion is brief\nfor the following reason: Article 3 does not accord to children a\nright to have their best interests protected and promoted. Indeed, it\ndoes not use the word \u2018right\u2019. The Article does impose on\nStates parties an obligation to ensure that all relevant organizations\nand legislative bodies make the best interests of children a relevant\nconsideration. However, the BIP sits oddly besides the other\nenumerated rights.\n\nMoreover, the BIP has been subject to numerous criticisms (Kopelman\n1997; Parker 1994) and claims of ambiguity, chief amongst which are\nthe following. First, the weight given to best interests can be\nvariously specified, a choice between \u2018primary\u2019 or\n\u2018paramount\u2019 being a significant one which preoccupied\nthose drafting the Convention. (Alston 1994 12). Second, there is an\nimportant difference between its use in respect of \u2018a\u2019\n(that is some particular) child and of \u2018children\u2019 (as a\nclass of humans). Third, it is implausible to view the BIP as\nrequiring that one must act \u2018so as to promote maximally the\ngood\u2019 of the child (Buchanan and Brock 1989, 10). Construed in\nliterally maximising terms (rather than merely what is good enough),\nthe BIP is unfeasibly demanding of agencies charged with the care of\nchildren. Fourth, the BIP does not, as it stands, take account of the\ninterests of others. We cannot be required to promote the best\ninterests of a child over and above, and without regard to, the\ninterests of any relevant adult.\n\nFifth, the interpretation of \u2018best interests\u2019 is unclear:\nit could be specified as what a child would choose for herself under\nspecified hypothetical circumstances; or what is, as a matter of fact,\nbest for the child, an account which is distinct from and independent\nof the child\u2019s desires, actual or hypothetical. If it is the\nlatter then, some argue, we cannot with certainty determine what is\nbest for a child. We cannot in practice make complete and accurate\nassessments of what will be the outcome of each and every policy\noption that we might adopt in respect of a child (Mnookin 1979). The\nBIP is indeterminate even where there are only two possible decisions\nto be made (Elster 1989, 134\u2013139). Such indeterminacy is\ncompounded and complicated by the fact of moral pluralism (Rawls 1993,\nxvi-xvii), whereby individuals subscribe to different conceptions of\nwhat makes life valuable. If we cannot agree how to rank as better or\nworse different kinds of life, we will not be able to agree what is\nbetter or best for the growing child. The fact of extensive\ndisagreement about what is best for children, or for a child, is often\nset in the context of broader cultural disagreements about morality in\ngeneral. It is said that the BIP is subverted, or at least rendered\ndeeply problematic, by the existence of these deep and pervasive\ncultural disagreements (Alston (ed.) 1994).\n\nIf we understand the BIP in terms of a child\u2019s hypothetical\nchoices, the most striking and influential thought is that we should\nchoose what is best for the child as the child would choose for\nherself if the child were adult. For instance, John Rawls thinks the\nfollowing formulation defines the acceptable paternalism of a\nguardian\u2019s treatment of his child: \u2018We must choose for\nothers as we have reason to believe they would choose for themselves\nif they were at the age of reason and deciding rationally\u2019\n(Rawls 1999, 183). This apparently simple formulation is in fact\nsusceptible of at least two quite different interpretations, each of\nwhich brings with it its own problems. In each case, we are seeking to\nspecify the adult person who chooses for the child.\n\nWe might, first, mean that we should choose for this child as the\nadult the child will become would choose. However, this does not\ndetermine a unique choice for, crucially, the nature of the adult that\nthe child will become precisely depends on the choices that are made\nfor it whilst a child. We can conceive of each of the different adult\nselves the child might develop into approving, respectively, of the\ndifferent choices made for its childhood self\u2014choices which were\nresponsible for the development of these different selves. Or, second,\nthe adult person who chooses for the child is an adult analogue of the\nchild. This is not the child\u2019s future adult self, which as we\nhave seen is indeterminate, but this child made into an adult version\nof itself. That is, we do not imagine this child developing in the\nfuture into its adult self. Rather we imagine a mature or grown-up\nversion of this child now making choices. This interpretation however\nwill still not work. The adult version of the child is one with\nchildish beliefs and desires filtered out. But, in the first place, it\nis not clear what remains of the child in any choice situation\nrendered hypothetical in this fashion. For the child just is someone\nwho has these childish beliefs and desires. What is it to be a child\nif not to think and want as a child does? Second, it is entirely\nindeterminate what should replace these beliefs and desires.\n\nHowever, in the case of children, by contrast with adults, we cannot\ncash out the various hypothetical conditionals. We do not know what a\nchild would choose if possessed of adult rational powers of choice,\nbecause what makes a child a child just is its lack of such powers\n(its ignorance, inconstant wants, inconsistent beliefs, and limited\npowers of ratiocination). At the same time, we cannot ask how an adult\nwould choose if in the child\u2019s situation just because an adult\nwould not be in that situation, or would not be in a child\u2019s\nsituation. We must, it seems, choose for a child because a child\ncannot choose for itself, and we must choose what is best for a child\nnot what some imagined adult version of the child would choose for\nitself.\n\nTo repeat, the BIP, despite its importance, is not a child\u2019s\nright. Moreover, as well as being beset by these various problems, it\nis also arguably in tension with some of the other rights a child has.\nIn particular, the obligation to do what is best for the child stands\nagainst an obligation to give serious consideration to a child\u2019s\nown view of what is in their interests. This requirement is discussed\nin Section 9.\n8. Children and the Reproduction of Values\n\nThe putative possession by a child of a right to an \u2018open\nfuture\u2019 together with the imperative to promote any\nchild\u2019s best interests raises the question of what, if anything,\nis wrong with the transmission to a child of values. These most\nobviously may be those values by which the child\u2019s parent lives\nand which may also help to define the identity of a community. Article\n2 of the UNCRC accords the child a right to non-discrimination on\nvarious grounds including \u2018national, ethnic or social\norigin\u2019; and Article 30 recognises that a child belonging to an\n\u2018ethnic, religious or linguistic\u2019 minority \u2018shall\nnot be denied the right, in community with other members of his or her\ngroup, to enjoy his or her own culture, to profess and practise his or\nher own religion, or to use his or her own language\u2019.\n\nYet, for many liberals, there is a tension between the recognition of\nsuch rights and the requirement that a child not be inducted into a\ncommunity in such a manner that his or her future adult choices are\nconstrained. The main way in which this is set out is by means of an\nemphasis upon a liberal ideal of an autonomous life, one in which an\nindividual is able both to form his or her own conception of the good\nlife to lead and is not prevented \u2013 by external social\ncircumstances or the actions of others \u2013 from being able to lead\nthe preferred life. Often the target that is juxtaposed to such a\nliberal ideal is the values of religious minorities. The Supreme Court\njudgment that prompted Joel Feinberg\u2019s defence of a\nchild\u2019s right to an \u2018open future\u2019, and which has\nbeen extensively discussed, is Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972). This\nexempted the Amish community from the requirement to keep their\nchildren in school to the age others are so required in the interests\nof maintaining that community\u2019s identity. Arneson and Shapiro in\nresponse contrast \u2018religious traditionalist\u2019 and\n\u2018secular worldly\u2019 ways of life, seeing an education for\nthe latter as the best preparation for an open future (Arneson and\nShapiro 1996).\n\nThe problem with this approach is that the preferential treatment\n\u2013 in the way that children are schooled \u2013 is both\ndiscriminatory and may violate the central precept of liberal\nneutrality, the requirement that the state not, in its law and\npolicies, favour any conception of the good (see the entry on\nPerfectionism in Moral and Political Philosophy). Moreover, some\nliberals will argue that the character traits and dispositions of\nautonomy, for instance steadfastness of character, are best taught by\nbeing raised in adherence to a particular way of life, such as one of\nreligious faith (Callan, 2002; Burtt 1996).\n\nLiberals may escape the charge of violating the principle of\nneutrality by arguing that a liberal society requires that its\ncitizens be motivated by a sense of justice and an ability to\nparticipate effectively within democratic institutions. This\nrequirement is satisfied only if children are brought up in certain\nvalues and are able, when adults, to make maximally autonomous\nchoices. In this manner the promotion of autonomy and an open future\ncan be seen as an indirect consequence of a necessary education in\nthose civic capacities that are the necessary precondition of stable\nand sustainable liberal institutions.\n\nThe tension that is broached by a child\u2019s right to an open\nfuture is given a clear and provocative reading in Matthew\nClayton\u2019s book (Clayton 2006). He argues that parents may not\n\u2018enrol their children into comprehensive doctrines\u2019, in\nother words, bring them up to believe in general truths about the best\nway to lead a life, whatever the provenance of those truths. Thus, his\nview is broader than a critique of a religious education. But at the\nsame time, it would indict the vast majority of conscientious parents\nseeking to bring up their children as they see best.\n\nHis defence of this view relies on a claimed analogy between the\nexercises of political and of parental power. The former is only\nlegitimate on liberal grounds in the absence of any appeal to the\ncorrectness of some comprehensive doctrine. Clayton thinks that the\nsimilarities between the two exercises of power are sufficiently\nstrong and robust for parental conduct to be constrained by the same\nliberal principle of legitimacy.\n\nIn response it may be argued that the two domains of power are not\nanalogous. It may also be suggested that there is a morally relevant\ndifference between parents setting out to enrol their children in a\ncomprehensive doctrine and children coming to share such a doctrine\nbecause of sharing their life with their parents (Archard 2002).\nIndeed, if the institution of the family as an essentially intimate\nand private community of adults and children can be defended and if,\nfurther, adults have a protected right to lead their lives by the\nlight of their preferred conception of the good, then such unintended\nenrolment is inevitable. Others will argue that it is not possible to\nteach children that sense of justice which liberals see as critical to\nthe sustainability of a fair society without embedding it in a\ncomprehensive doctrine (Franklin-Hall 2019).\n\nIt is of course a further question of whether certain communal\nvalues violate liberal values other than autonomy \u2013 such as\nequality. For example, it would be wrong to rear boys and girls in\ngendered stereotypes that perpetuate inequality and\ndiscrimination.\n9. The Right to be Heard\n\nThe right to be heard is a valuable right. What makes it valuable is\nboth that there is a point to making one\u2019s views known and,\nfurther, that making one\u2019s views known makes a difference. It\nmatters to me that I can speak out on political questions. It matters\nalso, and probably more, if what I say leads to the changes I favour.\nCorrelatively, it is true both that I do not want to be silenced and\nthat I do not want the statement of my views to be ineffectual. As a\nfurther general point there will always be some issues on which it is\nmore important that I be allowed to speak and that what I say about\nthese issues carries weight in determining outcomes. Those are the\nissues that matter to me, and the more they matter the more important\nit is that I have the freedom to speak about them and be heard. On one\naccount, since children\u2019s views should not be\n\u2018authoritative\u2019, that is, determinative of what is done,\nthey have only a \u2018consultative\u2019 role (Brighouse 2003).\nThey may influence an outcome by, most obviously, providing those who\ndo make the decisions affecting a child\u2019s interests with a\nclearer picture of what in fact is in those interests. On another\naccount, encouraging and according a weight to the expression of\nchildren\u2019s views\u2014even where this is unlikely to affect\noutcomes in line with the views\u2019 content\u2014is valuable just\nbecause the child is capable of expressing a view and deserves to be\nlistened to (Archard and Skivenes 2009).\n\nHow is it with the child\u2019s right to be heard? It will be\nimportant for the child to be listened to. But it is also important\nthat the child is heard in the sense that her views are given due\nconsideration and may influence what is done. Note that the\nchild\u2019s right to be heard on matters affecting its own interests\nis a substitute for the liberty right to make one\u2019s own choices.\nThe right to be heard is only a right to have the opportunity to\ninfluence the person who will otherwise choose for the child. The\npower to make those choices resides with the adult guardian or\nrepresentative of the child. All the child retains is the right to try\nto motivate that adult to choose as the child herself would choose if\nshe was allowed to.\n\nArticle 12.1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the\nChild not only accords the child the right freely to express its views\non matters affecting the child. It also, and crucially, gives the\nchild an assurance that these views will be given \u2018due weight in\naccordance with the age and maturity of the child\u2019. Great\nemphasis is now placed on what are termed a child\u2019s\n\u2018participation rights\u2019 as opposed to his or her\n\u2018protection rights\u2019. The latter, as the name suggests,\nprotect the child from violent, abusive, cruel or exploitative\ntreatment. \u2018Participation rights by contrast, give children\nsome entitlement to be the agents of their own lives. Article 12.1\nprovides a crucial underpinning justification for such rights. There\nare problems in understanding how practically to implement such rights\n(Ang, et al. 2006). There are also theoretical issues in making precise\nsense of what a right such as that enshrined in Article 12.1 might\nmean. Its complexities lie in understanding the difference between an\nadult\u2019s power of choice and a child\u2019s views on critical\npersonal matters, in the different ways we might consider a\nchild\u2019s views, in how to weight those views and how their\nweighting makes a practical difference in coming to a decision\n(Archard and Uniacke 2020).\n\nThe celebrated British legal judgement in the Gillick case (Gillick\n[1986]) provides a useful contrast to Article 12. This judgement has\nbeen extensively discussed, and it has also been highly influential in\nmatters relating to the consent of children to medical treatment.\n\nThe Gillick judgement arose from the dissatisfaction of a mother with\nthe failure of her local health authority to withdraw an advisory\ncircular to the area\u2019s doctors. This advised doctors that they\ncould counsel and inform young girls under the age of 16 about sexual\nmatters as well as provide them with contraception, and that they\ncould do this without the consent of the child\u2019s parents. The\nmother, Victoria Gillick, went to court to have the circular declared\nunlawful. The final judgement by the British House of Lords was that\nthe circular was not unlawful. A key issue, relevant to the present\ndiscussion, concerned the proper relationship between the\nchild\u2019s right to decide for itself and the parent\u2019s right\nto decide for the child.\n\nIn deciding in favour of the health authority one of the Law Lords,\nLord Scarman, made a statement crucial to his finding and one that has\nsubsequently been much cited. It is worth reproducing:\n\n\nThe underlying principle of the law \u2026 is that\nparental right yields to the child\u2019s right to make his own\ndecisions when he reaches a sufficient understanding and intelligence\nto be capable of making up his own mind on the matter requiring\ndecision. (Gilick [1986], 186)\n\nI would hold that as a matter of law the parental right to determine\nwhether or not their minor child below the age of 16 will have medical\ntreatment terminates if and when the child achieves a sufficient\nunderstanding and intelligence to enable him to understand fully what\nis proposed. (Gillick [1986], 188\u20139)\n\n\nVarious questions arise. First, what does it mean for a child to get\nto a particular point in their development? On what could be called\nthe threshold interpretation, once a child has achieved a certain\nlevel of competence, her views as to what shall happen to her have a\ndeterminate weight, either amounting to a liberty right of choice (on\na strong version) or (on a weak version) being counted in the balance\nagainst her parents\u2019 views and the state\u2019s judgement of\nher best interests. On what could be called the proportionality\ninterpretation, the child\u2019s views progressively increase in\nweight as she gains a greater competence to choose for herself. They\nincrease up to the acquisition of a full liberty right of choice.\n\nSecond, on either the threshold or the proportionality account we need\na measure of that ability that marks the threshold or is simply\nprogressively acquired. How much intelligence and understanding, for\ninstance, is sufficient? In the first place, this measure must be\ntaken independently of any judgement of what is in the child\u2019s\nbest interest. That a child would choose what is taken to be in her\nbest interests is at most evidence that she does have sufficient\nintelligence and understanding of the relevant issue. Her making such\na choice is not a necessary condition of her having the requisite\nability. Similarly, the making by a child of a poor choice is not\nconclusive evidence of her general incapacity to choose for herself.\nWise adults can occasionally make stupid decisions just as fools\nsometimes get it right.\n\nIn the Gillick judgement, Scarman required of the child that she\nmanifest an understanding of the \u2018nature\u2019 of the\ncontraceptive advice offered and \u2018also have a sufficient\nmaturity to understand what is involved\u2019 (Gillick [1986], 189).\nWe can distinguish here a number of possible elements. There is,\nfirst, knowledge of certain facts. One child, for instance, knows that\na contraceptive acts to prevent conception that might otherwise result\nfrom sexual intercourse. Another child, by contrast, could simply be\nignorant of or unable to comprehend the facts of reproduction. There\nis, second, an understanding of what follows for the child from an act\nor its omission. Thus, failure to use a contraceptive could lead a\nyoung person who had sexual intercourse to become pregnant. These two\nunderstandings together constitute knowledge of the\n\u2018nature\u2019 of the act. Finally, there is what arguably comes\nwith \u2018maturity\u2019 which is the ability to appreciate the\nsignificance both of an act or its omission and of the relevant\nconsequences. It is one thing to know what it is to become pregnant,\nand another to understand what that means. This latter understanding\ninvolves realising that pregnancy brings in its wake physical changes,\nthat any resultant birth leaves a young person with a child to care\nfor, and so on. Scarman even insisted that the child would need to\nhave an appreciation of the \u2018moral and family\u2019 questions\ninvolved.\n\nThird, it is important in measuring a child\u2019s competence against\nthat in respect of which he or she is expressing a view to distinguish\nbetween the complexity and the seriousness of the matter. A simple\nchoice\u2014for instance that between only two options such as\nwhether to have a life-saving operation\u2014may nevertheless be\nportentous, having enormous and far-reaching consequences. It may thus\nrequire much greater appreciation of what is involved than a more\ncomplex decision, one that ranges over many possibilities. Yet the\nlatter kind of choice\u2014consider choosing a five-course meal from\na very large menu\u2014is far less serious in its consequences. In\nshort, the difficulty or complexity of a choice should not be confused\nwith its importance or significance for the child.\n\nFourth, the English courts at least have detected a fundamental\nasymmetry between refusing and choosing to have treatment. A competent\nadult has a right both to choose to have treatment and to refuse it.\nShould this not also be the case with a competent child? A 15-year-old\nwho wants to have a particular operation against her parents\u2019\nwishes and even contrary to the best judgement of her doctors may be\njudged competent and thus have her wishes respected. However, the\nEnglish courts in a series of judgements after Gillick have argued\nthat matters are somehow different when it is a case of a child\nrefusing an operation.\n\nOf course, there is no inconsistency if a refusal requires a greater\ndegree of understanding and appreciation of the issues than a positive\nacceptance. But where the choice is a simple disjunction, it is hard\nto see how this can be the case. Are not the issues at stake the same\nfor both disjuncts? If the courts believe that an obligation to act in\nthe best interests of the child trumps one to respect the wishes of a\ncompetent child, it needs to be shown why this obligation does not\nhave force in all circumstances. Why would a court not deny treatment\nto a child it does not believe in her best interests when it judges\nher competent to choose? If a child is competent then she is in all\nsignificant and relevant respects the equal of an adult and should be\nable both to choose and to refuse treatment.\n\nThree final comments on the child\u2019s right to choose are in\norder. First, what is deemed to be in the child\u2019s best interests\nis evidence for, but not finally determinative of, a judgement as to\nthe competence of the child. Nevertheless, balancing a child\u2019s\nright to be heard against a child\u2019s right to have its best\ninterests promoted is difficult. Second, it is arguably enough to show\na child\u2019s competence that a child understands the nature of the\nact. After all, no more is needed for an adult\u2019s consent to be\ninformed. In the law of contract adults need only to know what they\nare signing up to. They do not need a full appreciation of the\ncontract\u2019s significance and of its import for their future\nlives. Third, Gillick competence as specified is very demanding.\nIndeed, there are many adults who, in making their choices, fail to\ndisplay the maturity and \u2018understanding of what is\ninvolved\u2019 that is dictated as necessary for the child. Why then\nshould a child have to display a competence that many adults lack both\nin general and in particular cases?\n10. Summary\n\nOne important, indeed central, manner of understanding the moral\nstatus of the child is by questioning whether or not children have\nrights. It is normally thought that according to the\n\u2018will\u2019 theory of rights children cannot have rights,\nwhereas according to the \u2018interest\u2019 theory they can. It\nis, however, at least possible on the \u2018will\u2019 theory that\nchildren could have rights, albeit ones that are exercised by trustees\nor representatives.\n\nChild \u2018liberationists\u2019 claim that children have all the\nrights that adults do. Others deny this, either believing that\nchildren have no rights or believing that children have only some of\nthe rights which adults possess. Those who believe children have no\nrights deny that children are qualified as adults are to have rights.\nThey further argue that the ascription of rights to children manifests\na misunderstanding of what children are like and of the nature of\nfamily relationships. Those who deny children all or some of the\nrights possessed by adults nevertheless believe that children, as\nhumans, have a certain moral status that ought to be protected.\n\nThose who say that drawing a line between adults and children in\nrespect of their possession of rights is arbitrary may mean different\nthings. To deny that different capacities are progressively acquired\nat different ages is implausible. To insist that drawing a line as\nsuch is wrong ignores the point of doing so, and recourse to the\nalternative of a competency test is not appropriate or practicable. On\nthe standard view, children have welfare but not liberty rights,\nwhereas adults have both. Adults also have the right that their\nchildhood selves shall grow up to be adults of a certain sort.\nChildren do not have an interest in remaining in childhood.\n\nThe best-interest principle with all its problems of interpretation\nsits oddly alongside the rights that are accorded to the child,\nespecially that of a right to be heard in matters affecting its\ninterests. This right in turn is a substitute not a complement to the\nright of choosing for oneself, and the Gillick competence which\nqualifies a child to exercise its rights of decision-making is\narguably stringently defined.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["References Cited", "Other Important Work"], "cat_ref_text": {"References Cited": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Alston, P.
