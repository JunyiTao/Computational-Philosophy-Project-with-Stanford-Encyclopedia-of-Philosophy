    "main_text": "Late Writings || The Historicity of Things\n4.3 The Historicity of Things\n\n\u201cThe Historicity of Things\u201d (1936) is one of\nAlexander\u2019s last papers. One reason it is valuable is\nthat it gives a concise overview of Alexander\u2019s spacetime\nmetaphysics in his own words. Another reason it is valuable is\nthat it tackles an unusual theme: the relationship between history and\nnature. Alexander argues that while some of the contributions to\nphilosophy from science are clear, it is less clear what philosophy\ncan learn from history (Alexander 1936: 12). Alexander argues that, as\ntime and motion belong to the most fundamental level of reality, all\nthat exists is \u201chistorical\u201d. As such, science begins with\nhistory:\n\n\nHistory can claim to be mistress of science, as much as mathematics,\nthough in a different sense. They stand for the two vital elements in\nevery science which cannot be separated, if they can be considered\nseparately, the constructive process by which we discover by our\nthought the order inherent in things, and the raw material\nitself\u2026 It must be remembered, however, of course, that\nhistorical science is but one of the sciences which arise\nfrom the facts and happenings of the world. (Alexander 1936: 24)\n\n\nAlexander\u2019s characterisation of history as having the whole\nworld as its subject matter is interesting not least because it proved\nso controversial. Both R. G. Collingwood and Hilda Oakeley, two\nphilosophers of history associated with British idealism, took strong\nissue with Alexander\u2019s description; see Collingwood\u2019s\nreprinted Principles of History (1938 [1999: 56]) and\nOakeley\u2019s \u201cThe World as Memory and as History\u201d\n(1925\u20136).\n\nBoth Oakeley and Collingwood corresponded with Alexander, and what has\nsurvived of their correspondence can be found in the Samuel Alexander\nPapers at the John Rylands Library. The Alexander-Collingwood\ncorrespondence has been published in Kobayashi (2021), who also\nprovides discussion. \n",
