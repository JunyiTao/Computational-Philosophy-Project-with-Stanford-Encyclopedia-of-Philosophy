    "main_text": "Replies to Bradleyean Arguments || External Relations with Special Features\n3.3 External Relations with Special Features\n\nPhilosophers impressed by Bradleyean arguments, but with the desire to\npreserve relations as unifiers of complex entities such as states of\naffairs or bundles of tropes, have been drawn towards postulating\nrelations with certain special features. Convinced that relations\nordinarily concieved would lead to a dangerous regress, these\nphilosophers have tried to equip their relations with characteristics\nthat would enable them to relate their relata and answer the\n\u201chow do relations relate?\u201d question.\n\nFor instance, Vallicella has argued in favor of an external unifying\noperator that connects a fact\u2019s constituents and brings facts\ninto existence. This external unifier U is described as a\n\u201cmetaphysical agent\u201d that acts as an \u201cexistence\nmaker\u201d for facts (Vallicella 2000: 250); it does so due to\n\u201cthe power of contingent self-determination\u201d, i.e., it has\n\u201cthe power to contingently determine itself as operating upon\nits operand\u201d (Vallicella 2000: 256). In characterizing U\nin this way, Vallicella is trying to ensure both that the connection\nbetween U and what it unifies remains contingent, and\nthat such unity is grounded in U itself (out of worry about the\ninfinite regress). The only way that he can see U fulfill both\nthese roles is by construing it \u201calong the lines of God or a\ntranscendental consciousness\u201d (Vallicella 2000: 256). The\ntrouble with this reply to Bradleyean arguments is, of course, that\nthe god-like creating role of the external unifier U remains\nquite murky and it seems to bring in consciousness into both the\noperator itself as well as the creation of states of affairs.\n\nAnother novel relation has been proposed by Meinertsen (2008). He has\nargued for a self-relating relation to do the uniting of particulars\nand universals into states of affairs. According to this proposal,\nwhat makes R related to the pair (a, b) is a\nunifying self-relating relation U* which unites\nitself to R, a, and b. Thus, a state of\naffairs R (a, b) turns out to be identical to the\nstate of affairs U* (U*, R, a,\nb) and a state of affairs Fa is just a short for\nU*(U*, F, a) (cf. Meinertsen 2008:\n12). The self-relating relation U* occurs\ntwice in the states of affairs it unites: the first time, outside the\nbrackets, U* occurs in its \u201cactive\u201d relating\nrole; the second time, inside the brackets, U* occurs in its\n\u201cpassive\u201d role as one of the constituents being related\n(cf. Meinertsen 2008: 15). \n\nAll this evokes Russell\u2019s talk of relations having dual nature,\ni.e., being able to occur as terms of relations as well as relating\nrelations. The trouble with such dual roles, is to explain, as Bradley\nasked Russell: \u201cWhat is the difference between a relation which\nrelates in fact and one which does not so relate?\u201d (Bradley\n1911: 74). Or for Meinertsen: What is the difference between a\nrelation occurring in its passive role and it occurring in its active\nrole? If we are willing to accept as a primitive that\nthere is such a difference and that it is thanks\nto U*\u2019s dual role as a self-relating relation that it\nis able to unify constituents of a complex a, b,\nand R, then why exactly is such a view an improvement upon a\nview that takes it that a relating relation\nR simply relates its relata?\n\nWeiland and Betti (2008) on the one hand, and Maurin (2010) on the\nother, have argued for relata-specific relations as unifiers of tropes\nin trope bundles (Weiland and Betti hint at a possible extension of\nthis idea to relations unifying particulars and universals in states\nof affairs). They have argued that the relational trope of\ncompresence construed as asymmetrically dependent on specific\nrelata is the way to solve the Bradleyean unity problem. It is part of\nthe very nature of the relation of compresence to relate specific\nrelata; thus, there would be a different compresence trope for each\nspecific bundle of tropes. As Weiland and Betti put it: \n\n\nIf a relation is relata-specific, it necessarily relates its relata,\nbut only if it exists. To put it in possible-worlds\nterminology: if R holds between a and b in the\nactual world, it holds between a and b in all possible\nworlds in which R exists (and not in any possible world in\nwhich a and b exist, or in any possible world\nwhatsoever). (Weiland and Betti 2008: 519)\n\n",
