Identifying group rights\n\nA group right is a right possessed by a group qua group rather than by\nits members severally. It contrasts with a right held by an individual\nperson as an individual. An example of a commonly asserted group right\nis the right of a nation or a people to be self-determining. If there\nis such a right, it is a right possessed and exercised by a nation or\na people as a group. It will not be reducible to the individually-held\nrights to individual self-determination of those who belong to the\nrelevant nation or people. Other rights that have often been asserted\nas group rights include the right of a cultural group that its culture\nshould be respected and perhaps protected; the right of a linguistic\ngroup that its language should be usable and provided for in the\npublic domain; and the right of a religious group that it should be\nfree to engage in collective expressions of its faith. Groups rights\nare also claimed for organized groups such as commercial corporations,\nchurches, political parties, universities and charitable associations.\nIn each of these cases, the right is a right held by the group qua\ngroup, and duties generated by the right will be duties owed to the\ngroup.\n\nGroup rights should not be confused with rights that people possess in\nvirtue of being group members. People normally possess rights as\nmembers of universities or sports clubs or businesses or trade unions\nor churches or states but, in the ordinary run of cases, these are\nindividual rights. For example, the right of a member of a university\nto use its library, or the right of a citizen to vote in elections, is\nthe right of an individual person. An infringement of that right would\ninfringe the right of the individual right-holder, rather than a group\nright of the relevant university or state. In fact, most rights held\nby individuals are associated with group identities or group\nmemberships of some sort. If we are willing to extend rights to\nnon-human animals, even human rights will be rights unique to a\nparticular group; yet most human rights are conceived as individual\nrights and, on some views, can only be individual rights.\n\nA group right should not therefore be identified with a\n\u201cgroup-differentiated\u201d right. That term has been coined by\nWill Kymlicka (1995) to describe a right that is accorded to a\nparticular group but not to the larger society within which the group\nexists. For example, a society might accord special rights, such as\nspecial territorial rights or rights of self-government, to an\nindigenous minority in recognition of the special status that that\nminority should enjoy within the larger society, or out of concern for\nthe vulnerability of its traditional form of life. These would be\n\u201cgroup-differentiated rights\u201d. That term is now sometimes\nabbreviated to \u201cgroup right\u201d, which is unfortunate since a\ngroup-differentiated right may or may not be a group right properly\nso-called. If, for example, the group-differentiated right is the\nright of a group to be self-governing, it will also be a group right.\nBut if it is, for example, a right unique to the members of an\nindigenous minority to fish in certain waters and if that right is\nvested in, and is exercisable by, the several individuals who make up\nthe minority, it will be a group-differentiated individual right.\n(Kymlicka 1995, 45\u201348; Jones 2010.)\n2. Moral and legal group rights\n\nGroup rights can be legal or moral or both. If a legal system accords\nrights to a group, or recognises it as an entity possessing rights, it\nwill simply be the case, for that legal system, the group has rights.\nThose legal rights might then spawn moral rights. A law may create a\nwrong that would not otherwise be a wrong but, if the legal system is\ngenerally just and if the law serves a useful purpose, its breach may\nbe considered a moral, as well as a legal, wrong. For example, you may\nhave no right to a particular good in the absence of a law giving you\nlegal title to it but, once you have legal title, my theft of that\ngood can wrong you morally as well as legally. Similarly, once a group\nhas been accorded legal rights, we might think that, in at least some\ncases, violations of its legal rights wrong it morally as well as\nlegally. A group may therefore be credited with legally-dependent\nmoral rights.\n\nIf group rights could only ever be creatures of law, however, we could\nnot protest that a legal system failed to recognise or respect a\ngroup\u2019s right. Proponents of group rights, like proponents of\nindividual rights, have been keen to use the language of rights in\narguing about the form that legal, political and social arrangements\nshould take. That implies a conception of group rights that is moral\nin foundation and that might be used to determine what legal rights\ngroups should have. It is as moral rights that group rights are most\ncontroversial. Individual rights are subject to innumerable disputes,\nbut few deny that individuals, as persons or in other capacities, are\ncapable of possessing rights. By contrast, many reject the very idea\nthat groups can possess moral rights and even those who embrace that\nidea frequently disagree over the sorts of group that can possess\nthem.\n3. Groups as right-holders\n\nNo-one ascribes rights promiscuously to every kind of group, so what\nmakes a group the kind of group that might bear rights? For many\ntheorists an essential condition is the integrity it manifests: a\ngroup must surmount a threshold of unity and identity as a group if it\nis to be capable of bearing rights.\n\nThus Peter French (1984, 5\u201318) distinguishes between\n\u201caggregate collectivities\u201d and \u201cconglomerate\ncollectivities\u201d. An aggregate collectivity is a mere collection\nof individuals such as a crowd or the people standing at a bus stop or\na statistical category such as middle-income earners. If we were to\nascribe either moral responsibility or moral rights to an aggregate,\nthose would be reducible, without remainder, to the responsibilities\nand rights of the several individuals who made up the aggregate. A\nconglomerate collectivity, by contrast, has a unified being since it\nis formally constituted as an organization with an internal structure,\nrules, offices and decision-procedures. (For a similar, but not\nidentical, distinction between aggregates and organizations, see Copp\n1984.) French\u2019s examples of conglomerates include the Democratic\nParty, the US Congress, the US army, the Red Cross, university\nfaculties and business corporations. Organizations of this sort have\nidentities that are not exhausted by those of the persons in them; one\nperson\u2019s leaving and another\u2019s joining does not yield a new\norganization. Thus, \u201cwhat is predicable of a conglomerate is not\nnecessarily predicable of all of those or any of those individuals\nassociated with it\u201d (1984, 13), including the rights and\nresponsibilities we might ascribe to the conglomerate. French does not\ndeny that the individuals in a conglomerate, such as a business\ncorporation, will have rights and responsibilities relating to its\nactivities; he denies only that the rights and responsibilities of the\nconglomerate can be distributed without remainder amongst those\nindividuals. Thus, if the Gulf Oil Corporation buys or sells property,\nor joins a cartel, or is found causally responsible for environmental\npollution and held morally responsible for cleaning it up, the\nCorporation as agent and as patient is not reducible to the\nindividuals who are currently associated with it.\n\nDwight Newman (2011, 4) distinguishes in a similar fashion between\n\u201csets\u201d and \u201ccollectivities\u201d. A set, like\nFrench\u2019s aggregate, becomes a different set each time its membership\nchanges. A collectivity, by contrast, remains identifiable as the same\ncollectivity even though its membership changes. For both French and\nNewman, a group\u2019s having an identity that survives changes in its\nmembership is essential to its being the kind of group that might bear\nrights. (See also Graham 2002, 68\u20139; List and Pettit 2011,\n31\u201332; Van Dyke 1977.)\n\nThe phenomenon of a group\u2019s having an identity and existence that is\nseparate from its members is most readily apparent in the case of\nformally organised groups. So, for example, we can think of a football\nclub or a university department or a trade union as remaining the same\nfootball club, university department or trade union, even though the\nindividuals who constitute its members change over time. When you or I\njoin or leave a formally constituted organisation, there is something\nindependent of ourselves that we join or leave. Thus, if we ascribe\nrights to a formally constituted group, the right-bearing group will\nbe something other than the set of individuals who happen to belong to\nit at any moment.\n\nFormal organization may not be deemed essential to a group\u2019s having an\nirreducible and enduring identity. Nations, for example, are often\nconceived as entities whose identities run across successive\ngenerations of nationals. A nation\u2019s historic entitlement to a\nparticular territory would typically be conceived as the entitlement\nof a single enduring entity rather than a right inherited and\nbequeathed by successive generations of nationals so that,\nhistorically, no temporally continuous entity has possessed rights\nover the territory. People are given to thinking of nations in this\nunitary and enduring fashion even in cases, such as the Kurds, where a\nnation has not been instantiated in a state, or the Poles, where the\nnation has been deprived of political independence for lengthy periods\nof its history. Whether we conceive a group as having an identity and\nbeing that supersedes that of its members turns not just on what we\nfind in the world, but also on how we see it.\n\nFor some proponents of group rights, we should look for the integrity\nessential for right-bearing neither in the group\u2019s internal\norganization nor in its objective characteristics but in its\nsubjectivity. What matters is that the individuals who make up the\ngroup feel themselves strongly bound together as members of a group\nwith which they identify. Marlies Galenkamp holds that a right-holding\ngroup must possess a strong form of intra-group solidarity and be the\nkind of group that communitarians describe as a constitutive community\n(1993, 81\u2013100, 111\u20132, 131; see also Segesvary 1995).\nMichael McDonald (1991) argues that it is a shared understanding\namongst individuals that they are normatively bound to each other that\nmakes them a group for moral purposes. That shared understanding may\nbe related to and promoted by shared objective characteristics, such\nas a common history, language, system of belief or social condition,\nbut it is still the subjectivity of the group rather than those\nobjective features that is crucial to its being a right-bearing group.\nLarry May (1987) and Paul Sheehy (2006, 151\u2013173) also find the\nsource of a group\u2019s moral status in the interrelatedness of its\nmembers, but argue those interrelationships are significant for the\ncommon interests and needs to which they give rise.\n\nA significant measure of unity and identity might then be essential\nfor a group\u2019s being the kind of group that can bear rights but, if it\nis, that condition would seem necessary rather than sufficient. Those\nwho question the very idea of group rights do not deny that groups\ncome in different forms or that some exhibit a high degree of unity or\nthat groups can be very important in people\u2019s lives. They deny only\nthat we have reason to ascribe groups, however unified and however\nsignificant, the moral properties they must possess if they are to be\nindependent right-holders. So where do proponents of group rights find\nthose properties?\n\nPhilosophical analyses of rights have been dominated by two rival\ntheories. One is the choice or will theory according to which to have\na right is to possess a choice (e.g. Hart 1982; Steiner 1998). On that\ntheory, rights can be possessed only by beings capable of choice. If\nwe take the case of claim-rights (rights that impose corresponding\nduties upon others), those rights should be ascribed only to beings\ncapable of exercising control over the performance of the\ncorresponding duties. We can possess rights only if we are capable of\nexercising them.\n\nThe other theory is the interest or benefit theory for which the\ncrucial feature of a right lies in its providing for the\nright-holder\u2019s interest or benefit (e.g. Kramer 1998; Lyons 1969). If\nwe take the case of claim-rights again, those rights can be ascribed\nto the beings at whose interests the corresponding duties are\ndirected, irrespective of whether the right-bearer is able to control\nthe performance of those duties. Of course, not every interest will\ngenerate a right and interest theorists usually therefore propose more\ndiscriminating versions of the theory. David Lyons (1969, 176), for\nexample, provides that someone has a claim-right only if they are the\n\u201cdirect, intended beneficiary\u201d of another\u2019s duty. In\nanother much-used formulation, Joseph Raz (1986, 166) holds that X has\na right \u201cif and only if X can have rights, and, other things\nbeing equal, an aspect of X\u2019s well-being (his interest) is a\nsufficient reason for holding some other person(s) to be under a\nduty\u201d.\n\nIn conformity with these rival theories, some accounts of group rights\nemphasize a group\u2019s capacity for choice or, as it is more commonly\ndescribed, its capacity for \u201cagency\u201d as the crucial test\nof its capacity to possess rights, while others focus upon the group\u2019s\ncapacity to possess interests as a group.\n\nA capacity for agency is central to the ascription of rights to groups\nin the accounts of Peter French (1984, 1995) and Christian List and\nPhilip Pettit (2011). French argues that we have reason to ascribe\nsome groups the moral agency and moral personality that we ordinarily\nascribe to human individuals. If a group is to be a moral agent, it\nmust be capable of intentional action as a group; it must be able to\nhave purposes, plans, goals and interests that motivate its conduct.\nIt must also be capable of making rational decisions about its\nintentions and of responding to events and ethical criticism by\nadjusting its intentions and behaviour as those bear upon others\n(1995, 10-12). Conglomerate groups, such as business corporations,\nwhich possess internal decision structures and expressly formulated\npolicies, can meet those conditions. That suffices to make them both\nmoral group agents and \u201cfull-fledged moral persons\u201d\nequipped with moral responsibilities and moral rights. They are\nproperly accorded \u201cwhatever privileges, rights and duties as\nare, in the normal course of affairs, accorded to all members of the\nmoral community\u201d (1984, 32).\n\nFor List and Pettit (2011) a group can be an agent if it has\nrepresentational states, so that it can form beliefs, and motivational\nstates so that it can possess desires. It must also be capable of\nprocessing and acting on its beliefs and desires and of attaining a\nminimal level of rationality, particularly consistency, in the way its\nattitudes connect with one another and with its environment. Organized\ngroups, such as states, churches, commercial corporations and\nvoluntary associations, can, they argue, satisfy those conditions and\nso be agents. The attitudes formed by such groups supervene on those\nof their individual members but are not reducible to those of their\nmembers. A group can therefore possess agency as a group.\n\nThe specific case that List and Pettit make for group agency is\nepistemological rather than ontological and cannot be reproduced here.\nAgency alone, however, does not make the case for group rights. A\nrobot could be an agent but it would not bear rights since it would\nnot possess the sort of agency required for personhood. List and\nPettit adopt a \u201cperformative\u201d conception of personhood,\naccording to which being a person turns on what an entity can do\nrather than the stuff of which it is made. To be a person is to be\n\u201can agent who can perform effectively in the space of\nobligations\u201d (173). It is to be capable of participating in a\nsystem of conventions, such as a system of law, in which the\nparticipator contracts and honours obligations to others and derives\nentitlements from the obligations of others. Group agents possess that\nnormative capability and so should be accounted persons. As persons,\nthey can and should be held morally responsible for their actions and\nbe credited with rights, albeit fewer rights than we should ascribe to\nnatural human persons (on which, see section 7 below).\n\nMaking group agency a necessary condition for group right-holding\nsignificantly limits the range of groups that might possess rights.\nAdina Preda (2012), for example, an adherent of the choice theory,\nholds that only organized groups equipped with collective\ndecision-procedures can possess rights since only they are capable of\nintentional action as groups. Groups that lack those structures, such\nas ethnic or linguistic groups, may have members who possess\nindividual rights relating to their group characteristics, but the\ngroups of which they are members will not possess rights as\ngroups.\n\nThose who subscribe to the interest theory of rights can view the\nrange of groups that might possess rights much more generously. Thus\nKeith Graham points out (2002, 89\u201393) that a group does not have\nto be a moral agent to be a moral patient or to be treated more or\nless justly or to flourish more or less well. Similarly for May\n(1987), McDonald (1991) and Sheehy (2006) the critical consideration\nis that a group can have interests as a group that are more than the\naggregated interests of its individual members. That renders groups\ncapable of being harmed or of being treated unjustly as groups and\ntherefore suitable candidates for rights.\n\nThe most developed and sophisticated interest-based account of group\nrights has come from Dwight Newman. For Newman (2011, Part I) groups\nthat constitute right-bearing \u201ccollectivities\u201d can range\nfrom corporations and churches to cultural groups and hockey teams. A\ncollectivity is distinguished by the central values to which it is\ncommitted and by a structure which defines its membership and marks it\noff from other groups. Its members are essential to its existence, but\nthe collectivity is no mere aggregation of its members. Rather, it\nsupervenes on its members. It supervenes on their existence but also\non their relationships with one another and their beliefs about those\nrelationships. Supervenience does not imply reducibility; neither the\nexistence of the collectivity, nor its actions or intentions, can be\nreduced to those of its individual members. For Newman a collectivity\nhas moral status as a collectivity. It can therefore bear moral rights\nand moral responsibilities as a collectivity. It can also have\ninterests, which are other than the aggregated interests of its\nmembers; those interests will lie in whatever makes the collectivity\u2019s\nlife go better as a collectivity. In conformity with Raz\u2019s conception\nof rights, a group\u2019s interests will generate rights whenever they are\nof sufficient importance to justify the ascription of duties to\nothers.\n\nMiodrag Jovanovi\u0107 (2012) provides another interest-based account\nof group rights but of a rather different sort. Current international\nand domestic systems of law ascribe rights to groups, such as rights of\nself-determination and rights designed to protect their cultures.\nJovanovi\u0107 seeks to explicate those rights by uncovering the\n\u201cnormative moral standpoint\u201d implicit in them. That\nstandpoint, which he himself endorses, is, he argues,\n\u201cvalue-collectivism\u201d: \u201cthe view that collective\nentities can have inherent value, which is independent of its\ncontribution to the well-being of individual members\u201d (2012, 6).\nIn other words, we should understand the legal rights attributed to a\ngroup as grounded in the irreducibly collective value of the group, a\nvalue that is not reducible to the value of the group for the several\nindividuals who constitute its members. Jovanovi\u0107 does not\nascribe those rights to every sort of group recognised in law. In\nparticular, he does not ascribe them to juristic persons, such as\nbusiness corporations and trade unions. Rather, he ascribes them only\nto groups that possess a pre-legal existence and identity, such as\nnational, ethnic, linguistic and religious groups. It is the\nirreducibly collective interests of those groups that, on his account,\nlegal group rights should aim to protect and promote.\n4. Group rights: corporate and collective\n\nThe various approaches to group rights described in the previous\nsection share a common feature. Each supposes that ascribing a right\nto a group entails conceiving the group as moral entity in its own\nright: the group must possess a moral standing that is not reducible\nto the standing of its members. That is why arguments about group\nrights frequently assume the same character as arguments about the\nascription of rights to foetuses or the dead or future generations or\nnon-human animals. In each case, the central issue is whether we\nshould allow that the relevant entity has the moral standing necessary\nfor it to bear rights.\n\nIf, for groups, we answer that question affirmatively, we shall\nconceive group rights analogously with individual rights. A group\nright, like an individual right, will be a right held by a single\nunitary entity. The right of a group will be \u201cits\u201d right\nrather than \u201ctheir\u201d right. Indeed, we might think of a\ngroup right as the right of a \u201cgroup-individual\u201d. Groups\nmight bear duties in the same fashion. A group, as a single integral\nentity, can possess duties just as it can possess rights, and those\nduties may derive from group rights. For example, each nation\u2019s right\nof self-determination is most obviously directed at other nations who,\nas nations, have corresponding duties to respect one another\u2019s rights.\n(It remains logically possible, of course, that duties stemming from\ngroup rights will fall upon individual persons, just as it is possible\nthat the rights of individual persons will generate duties for groups.\nOn the relatively neglected subject of group duties, see Collins,\n2019.)\n\nThis might be described as the \u201ctraditional\u201d conception of\ngroup rights, in that it describes the way in which group rights have\nbeen most commonly understood. In recent years, however, some\nproponents of group rights have conceptualised them quite differently.\nThey have understood a group right as a right that is the shared or\njointly held right of a set of individuals. In this conception, a\ngroup right is still properly so-called because the individuals who\nmake up the right-holding group possess a right together that none of\nthem possesses separately. The right is not a mere aggregation of\nrights held individually by the members of the group. But, a group\nright conceived in this way does not entail giving a moral status to\nthe group qua group that is separate from that of its members\nseverally. Rather, the moral standing that underwrites the group right\nis the moral standing of the several individuals who jointly hold the\nright. The group right is therefore conceived as \u201ctheir\u201d\nright rather than \u201cits\u201d right (Jones 1999a).\n\nThe distinction between these two conceptions has frequently passed\nunnoticed and there is no agreed vocabulary that marks it. The term\ncorporate will be used here to describe the traditional\nconception, since that conception presents a right-holding group as a\nunitary entity. The term collective will be used to describe\nthe conception of a group right as a shared or joint right, since it\nconceives a right-holding group as a \u201ccollection\u201d of\nindividuals, albeit a collection that is bound together in a way that\nenables them to hold their right collectively. (Note that, contrary to\nthis usage, many proponents of the \u201ccorporate\u201d conception\nof group rights use the term \u201ccollective\u201d to describe\nthose rights; e.g. Galenkamp 1993, Jovanovi\u0107 2012, McDonald 1991,\nNewman 2011.)\n\nJoseph Raz has provided the most influential statement of the\ncollective conception. According to Raz, if a right is to be a\ncollective right, it must satisfy three conditions:\n\nFirst, it exists because an aspect of the interest of human beings\njustifies holding some person(s) to be subject to a duty. Second, the\ninterests in question are the interests of individuals as members of a\ngroup in a public good and the right is a right to that public good\nbecause it serves their interest as members of that group. Thirdly,\nthe interest of no single member of that group in that public good is\nsufficient by itself to justify holding another person to be subject\nto a duty. (1986, 208)\n\n\nRaz\u2019s conception of a collective right is tied to his interest theory\nof rights according to which, as we have seen, X has a right if X has\nan interest that suffices to ground another\u2019s duty (1986, 166). Thus,\na group of individuals has a collective right if their shared interest\nis sufficient to ground a duty in others, and if the interest of any\nsingle member of the group is insufficient by itself to ground that\nduty. When these conditions are satisfied, the group of individuals\npossess a right together that none of them possesses separately. In\nfact, Raz argues that the interests that ground a right are not\nnecessarily limited to the interests of the right-holder; they can\nalso include interests that others have in the right-holder\u2019s having\nthe right (1986, 245\u201363; 1994, 44\u201359; 1995). For example,\nthe right of journalists not to disclose their sources is grounded not\nonly in their own interests but also in the public\u2019s interest in their\nhaving that right. That consideration can also apply to collective\nrights. The rights of a group in respect of its culture, for example,\nmight be grounded not only in the interests of the group\u2019s members in\ntheir culture but also in the interests of \u201coutsiders\u201d in\nthe continued existence of the group\u2019s culture.\n\nSome other theorists whose approach to group rights is consistent with\nwhat is described here as the \u201ccollective\u201d conception are\nNathan Brett (1991), Allen Buchanan (1993, 1994), Leslie Green (1991),\nVinit Haksar (1998), Lesley Jacobs (1991) and Seumas Miller (2001,\n2010). (See also Margalit and Raz 1990.) The collective conception\nneed not be tied to an interest theory of rights. Miller, for example,\ngives an account of the collective conception that owes nothing to\nthat theory (2001, 210\u201333). But the ascendancy of the interest\ntheory of rights in recent years has meant that those who have adopted\nthe collective conception have frequently followed Raz in combining it\nwith the interest theory. (For criticism of the collective theory so\nconceived, see Griffin 2008, 261\u2013265; Preda 2013.) Moreover,\nthat theory does provide a ready-made account of what it is that\nindividuals share\u2014interests\u2014that makes them a\nright-holding group. The way that interests can accumulate across\nindividuals also helps to explain how it is that a group of\nindividuals can have a right, as a group, that none of them possesses\nsingly. For Raz, the number of individuals in a group can affect both\nwhether the group has a right and how weighty its right is (1986, 187,\n209). Others are less comfortable with that \u201caggregative\u201d\nfeature of Raz\u2019s conception; yet the relevance of numbers is often\nhard to dismiss. Consider, for example, the claim of a linguistic\nminority that its language should be usable, and provided for, in the\npublic domain. Given the public costs of meeting that claim, it would\nseem implausible to hold that we should take no account of the size of\na linguistic minority (of which there may be several) in deciding\nwhether the claim amounts to a right.\n\nThe fact that, on the collective conception, the individual members of\na group hold their right jointly does not entail that the right must\nbe grounded in an interest that an individual could have as an\nindependent individual. Some goods take a necessarily collective form,\nso that they cannot be made available to an individual in isolation\nfrom others; for example, the good constituted by a group\u2019s culture or\nits communal form of life. Yet it still makes perfect sense to hold\nthat a group right to those goods is morally grounded in the interests\nof the several individuals who make up the relevant group and that the\nright is held jointly by those individuals. Thus, even though the\ncollective conception gives no moral standing to a group independently\nof its members, it can still account for groups\u2019 having rights to\ngoods that are necessarily non-individual in form.\n\nAt the same time, there is nothing in the logic of the collective\nconception that limits the possible objects of group rights to\nnon-individualizable goods. Nor, if we adopt the interest theory, need\nthe right-holding group be a group in virtue of anything other than\nthe shared interest that grounds their right. The second condition\nthat Raz stipulates for a collective right suggests that individuals\nmust be members of a group before they can go on to have interests of\na sort that might ground a collective right. Miller, too, makes\nmembership of a social group a defining condition of a joint right\u2019s\nbeing a collective right (2001, 211). But it is not clear why we\nshould hold that a set of individuals can have a collective right only\nif they constitute a group in virtue of something other than their\nshared interest. \n\nConsider the following example. A city is characterised by very heavy\ntraffic that poses a danger to its pedestrians. The city\u2019s pedestrians\nhave an interest in there being a network of walkways so that they can\nmove around the city in safety. Each pedestrian, as an individual, has\nan interest in those walkways, but the interest of just one pedestrian\nis insufficient to create a duty for the city authorities to construct\nthe walkways. However, the shared interest of all pedestrians may well\nsuffice to ground that duty, in which case pedestrians will have a\ncollective right that the authorities should construct and maintain\nthe walkways. The point of this example is not to insist that, in\nthese circumstances, pedestrians would indeed have that right. Rather\nit is to show that (a) a group might have a right to a good that is\nintelligible as a good for an independent individual, and (b) a\nright-holding group need be a group only in virtue of the shared\ninterest that grounds their right. The group need not be\ninstitutionalised as a group, nor need it be distinguished by a common\nascriptive feature. (In the example given, the fact that the\nright-sharing individuals are identifiable as\n\u201cpedestrians\u201d contributes nothing to their having a\ncollective right independently of their interest in being able to walk\naround the city safely, .)\n\nThe collective conception can, then, make sense of group rights both\nto goods that would be intelligible as goods for independent\nindividuals and to goods that are intelligible only as goods enjoyed\ncollectively with others. It is often supposed that, if a good takes a\nnecessarily collective form (e.g. the collective good of possessing a\ncommon culture), the interest in that good can be understood only as\nthe irreducible interest of a group. That is associated with the\nsupposition that, if the shared interest generates a group right, the\nright-holding group must also be understood as an irreducible moral\nentity. Both suppositions are mistaken. Even in the case of a shared\nor collective interest, the interests that do the moral work in\ngenerating a right are entirely intelligible as the interests of the\nseveral individuals who make up the group and whose good is at stake.\nSimilarly, the moral standing necessary for the individuals, as a\ngroup, to have a right to the shared good can be the standing of the\nseveral individuals who compose the group. Thus, vindicating group\nrights need not entail showing that the right-holding group has either\ninterests or a standing that is not reducible to those of its\nmembers.\n\nAt the same time, there is a limit to the range of cases the\ncollective conception can encompass. As was mentioned earlier, there\ncan be cases in which the interest of a group logically precedes that\nof its members and in which the members have interests simply because,\nqua members, they share in the interest of the group. For example, a\nfootball club may have the stated aim of being as successful as\npossible in playing against rival clubs. The club will then have an\ninterest in whatever will promote that aim, including fielding the\nstrongest team possible in each game. I, as a member of the club, will\nshare in its interests. So, for example, if it is in the club\u2019s\ninterest to drop me from its team because I am not playing well\nenough, that will also be in my interest qua member. That interest qua\nmember may conflict with a personal interest that I have in remaining\na team player, but arguably that does not disturb my interest qua\nmember. If we understand the interest that grounds a group\u2019s right as\nan interest that the group has independently of its members, and if we\nunderstand the members\u2019 interests as mere derivatives of that group\ninterest, we must understand both the interest and the right of the\ngroup according to the corporate model. The group right cannot be\nunderstood adequately as a product of the aggregated interests of the\nindividuals who populate the group (Newman 2011, 57\u201382).\n\nFor the same reason, the collective conception cannot easily make\nsense of a group right as a right possessed by a group whose identity\nis unaffected by changes in its membership. As Newman points out\n(2011, 59\u201360), if we conceive a group right as a right held\njointly by those who compose the group, each change in the group\u2019s\nmembership must entail a change in the identity of the right-holding\ngroup. On the other hand, that may not be an objection. Groups, such\nas cultural, linguistic, ethnic and religious groups, are often\nshifting amorphous entities and we may have to get used to the idea\nthat right-holding groups can be groups that have constantly changing\ncompositions. Practically, that may be of little consequence for group\nrights provided that there is a reasonable continuity of interest\namongst the group\u2019s members, so that the content of the right is not\ndisturbed by every change in membership.\n\nFinally, note three things about the distinction between corporate and\ncollective rights. First, the limits of the collective conception\nidentified above stem from its unwillingness to conceive a group\nseparately from its members. They do not stem from an inability of the\ncollective conception to make sense of necessarily shared or\ncollective interests\u2014interests that individuals can have only\nalong with others. Secondly, we can most readily conceive a group\nseparately from its members when it is formally constituted as an\ninstitution, as in the case of a football club or a university. But\nonce we separate a group from its members in that way, we run into the\nissue of whether we should really ascribe the right to an institution\nor an organisation rather than to a group (Sheehy 2006, 159\u2013167,\n175\u2013195). Presumably it is for that reason that people do not\nnormally describe the rights of Congress or Parliament or the Supreme\nCourt as \u201cgroup rights\u201d. Thirdly, it is logically possible\nto interpret some group rights as corporate and others as collective,\nso that we are not obliged to commit ourselves exclusively to just one\nof these conceptions.\n5. Group rights and collective goods\n\nThe distinction between corporate and collective rights concerns the\nway in which we might conceive the subject of a group right.\nBut the issue of whether there is reason to ascribe rights to groups\nis sometimes approached through their possible\nobjects\u2014through what group rights might be rights to.\nIf there are goods that have a necessarily group character and if\nthere are rights to those goods, it would seem that those must be\ngroup rights. So are there such goods?\n\nThe obvious place to start is with the economist\u2019s idea of public\ngoods. We might reasonably suppose with Raz (1986, 208) that a right\ncan be a group right only if it is a right to a good that is public to\nthe members of the right-holding group. For the relevant group, the\ngood must be non-excludable (it must be available to all members of\nthe group) and non-rival (its consumption by one member of the group\nmust not diminish its possible consumption by other members). However,\nas Denise R\u00e9aume has pointed out (1988, 8\u20139), some goods\nthat are deliverable only as public goods can reasonably be considered\nobjects of individual rights. Clean air is a standard example of a\npublic good, but we can reasonably hold that individuals have rights\nto clean air as individuals. An industrialist who seriously pollutes a\ncommunity\u2019s atmosphere might be held to violate the right to breathe\nunpolluted air of each individual in the affected community rather\nthan a collective or corporate right of the community as a group.\n\nR\u00e9aume\u2019s own proposal (1988, 1994), which has attracted much\nattention amongst commentators on group rights, is that we should\nunderstand group rights as rights to \u201cparticipatory\ngoods\u201d. A participatory good is a public good of a particular\ntype. It is a good whose enjoyment by an individual depends upon its\nalso being enjoyed by others. Consider the case of clean air again.\nAlthough this is typically a good that is public to a group, each\nindividual breathes in and out as an individual and enjoys the good of\nclean air as an individual. The goodness of clean air for me does not\ndepend upon its also being good for you, even though it is good for\nyou. Now consider goods such as friendship, a team game, and a\nconvivial party (R\u00e9aume 1988, 12\u201313; Waldron 1993,\n355\u20136). Those are necessarily social goods. I cannot enjoy\ngenuine friendship as an entirely individual good; I can play a team\ngame only if others do too; and I can take pleasure in conviviality\nonly as a shared experience. So some goods are necessarily\n\u201cparticipatory\u201d in nature. These goods have also been\ndescribed as \u201ccommunal\u201d (Waldron 1993, 339\u201369),\n\u201cshared\u201d (Green 1988 207\u20139; Raz 1995, 35\u20136),\nand \u201ccommon\u201d (Marmor 2001). Charles Taylor\u2019s notion of\n\u201cirreducibly social goods\u201d has been deployed to similar\neffect: if those goods are the objects of rights, their irreducibly\nsocial character implies that they must be the objects of group rights\n(Taylor 1995, 127\u2013145; Sheehy 2006, 159\u2013167,\n175\u2013195).\n\nParticipatory goods are goods that must be both produced and enjoyed\npublicly, and goods that are simultaneously produced and enjoyed by\nthose who participate in them. While participatory goods combine\nproduction with consumption, it is the necessarily public character of\ntheir enjoyment that really distinguishes them from other public\ngoods. It is because they can be enjoyed only as shared goods that,\nR\u00e9aume argues, only groups can have rights to them. Her claim\nis not that every participatory good must be the object of a right;\nrather it is that, if there is a right to a participatory good, that\nmust be a group right. The relevant right here is neither the\nliberty-right to participate in the good nor the claim-right to be\nunprevented by others from participating in the good, both of which\nwill normally be individual rights. Rather it is a right to the\nparticipatory good itself (e.g. the right not merely to participate in\nan orchestra but the right of the orchestra to play as an orchestra,\nthe right not merely to participate in a culture but the right that\nthe culture shall be maintained and protected).\n\nSome goods that can yield rights, and that are, R\u00e9aume argues,\nparticipatory in at least some of their aspects, are living in a\ncultured society, sharing a common language, and being a member of a\nreligious community. If groups have rights to these participatory\ngoods, do others have duties to provide them with those goods? If, for\nexample, a group has a right to its culture as a participatory good,\nthat might imply that it is entitled to constrain the freedom of its\ndissident members in ways that ensure the continuance of its culture.\nIf a linguistic minority has a right to its language as a\nparticipatory good, that might imply that it is entitled to coerce\nreluctant others to use its language in order to sustain and promote\nthe language as a participatory good. However, those are not the sort\nof rights that R\u00e9aume proposes since they would be unacceptably\nonerous for those who bore the duty (1988, 16\u201317; 1994,\n133\u20134; see also Marmor 2001). Moreover, some participatory goods\ncan be the goods they are only if people participate in them\nwillingly. \n\nThe group rights that R\u00e9aume suggests might relate to\nparticipatory goods are rights against \u201coutsiders\u201d rather\nthan \u201cinsiders\u201d. And they would be rights not to\noutsiders\u2019 participation in the good, but to their non-prevention of,\nand their non-interference with, the group\u2019s participatory good and\nperhaps also rights to measures and resources that will facilitate the\ngroup\u2019s continued enjoyment of its participatory good. A linguistic\nminority may, for instance, have a right that the majority society\nshould establish, maintain and respect arrangements that will secure\nthe minority\u2019s ability to continue using its language. Similarly, an\nindigenous minority may have a right that the majority society should\ninstitute arrangements that will protect its traditional form of life,\nwhich form of life is, for the minority\u2019s members, a participatory\ngood. But these externally directed rights would remain rights\ngrounded in the group\u2019s interest in its participatory good and that,\nfor R\u00e9aume, means they must be group rights.\n\nThere is an obvious gap in R\u00e9aume\u2019s attempt to identify group\nrights as rights to participatory goods (1994, 123\u20134). If only\ngroups can have rights to participatory goods, it does not follow that\ngroups can have rights only to participatory goods. They may also have\nrights to non-participatory goods, such as safe walkways or community\nhealth safeguards or coastal defences. Even the claim that rights to\nparticipatory goods must be group rights has not escaped challenge.\nJames Morauta (2002) argues that, conceptually, a participatory good\ncould be the object of an individual right. An individual might, for\nexample, have a right to require others to participate with him in\nspeaking his language and those others may be duty-bound to comply if\nhe so insists. That may be a morally unappealing state of affairs but\nnothing in the logic of rights or participatory goods rules it out\n(provided that the very nature of the good at issue does not require\nvoluntary participation). The lacuna that Morauta identifies indicates\nthat the proposition that only groups can have rights to participatory\ngoods relies upon more than just the \u201cstructural features\u201d\nof those goods. It relies also upon a moral assumption about the\nrelative standing of the individuals who have interests in, or who lay\nclaim to, a participatory good.\n\nSuppose, for example, that one person in a nation had, uniquely, a\nright that that nation should be self-determining. His\nfellow-nationals should then be part of a self-determining unit, not\nbecause they are entitled to be, but because he is entitled that they\nshould be. He therefore has a right over their lives that they\nthemselves do not. Normally, we would regard that sort of inequality\nin moral standing as entirely unacceptable; but it is because we take\nthat moral unacceptability for granted that we are predisposed to\naccept that rights to participatory goods\u2014or, indeed, rights to\npublic goods as public goods\u2014must be group rights. Of\ncourse, people of equal standing can be unequally interested in a good\nbut, in any sizeable group, it is most unlikely that one individual\u2019s\ninterest in a good that is public to the group will be so special and\nso disproportionate that that individual will have, uniquely, a right\nto the good as a good for the group as a whole (Jones 2014,\n2018).\n6. Scepticism about group rights\n\nCriticism of group rights can take a case-by-case form. The critic\nmight argue that close inspection of particular rights commonly\nclaimed as group rights reveals either that they are not rights at all\nor that they dissolve into individual rights (e.g. Griffin 2008,\n256\u2013276; Lagerspetz 1998). However, much criticism is directed\nat the very idea of group rights. That criticism is generally of two\nsorts: either it is sceptical of the claim that groups can hold rights\nor it is fearful of the implications or consequences of ascribing\nrights to groups.\n\nSceptics often object to the ontology of groups they take to be\nimplicit in the idea of group rights. To suppose that groups, like\nindividual persons, can hold rights is to suppose that groups can have\na being and an integrity that match those of individual persons. But\ngroups are collections of individuals and to make them out to be\nsupra-human entities that are somehow more than, or other than, the\nsum of their parts is mistaken: \u201conly individuals can make\ndecisions, can literally have values, literally engage in reasoning\nand deliberation\u201d (Narveson 1991, 334). Those who make and\nadminister the law may have good reason to create and to operate with\nfictions, such as the legal fiction of corporate personality. But\nmoral rights and duties can attach only to real persons;\n\u201cfictitious entities have no rights\u201d (Graff 1994, 194).\nGroups do not exist separately from their members and, when we ascribe\nrights to groups as such, we ignore that simple truth. (Narveson 1991,\n331\u20135; Wellman 1995, 157\u201377; cf Vincent 1989).\n\nDoubts about the integrity of groups are sometimes sociological rather\nthan ontological. Generally, we might suppose that the groups to which\nwe ascribe rights have a unity and identity that is independent of,\nand that provides the foundation for, our ascription of rights to\nthem. A group, such as an ethnic or cultural group, has a certain\n\u201cnatural\u201d existence and we recognise it as having rights\nbecause of the kind of existent it is. In reality, however,\npre-institutionalised groups are shifting and changing entities and\nlack clear boundaries. In addition, any section of humanity that we\nmight fasten upon as a group is likely to be part of a larger\nsociological entity, and to have within it smaller entities, that\nmight also claim to be \u201cgroups\u201d. So there can be a\nsignificant element of arbitrariness about the segments of humanity\nthat we identify as \u201cgroups\u201d. We may suppose that, in\nascribing rights to a group, we merely acknowledge the entitlements of\na pre-existing entity, but, in reality, it may be the ascription of\nrights itself that identifies, creates and fixes a segment of humanity\nas a \u201cgroup\u201d. (Flanagan 1985; Kukathas 1992, 110\u201315;\nMitnick 2006; Offe 1998, 125\u201331; Waldron 2002. Cf. Mello 2004;\nSharp 1999.)\n\nGroups may be found improper subjects of rights because they lack\nproperties, other than genuine integrity, that are deemed essential\nfor right-holding. As we have seen, proponents of the interest theory\nof rights are able to view group rights more generously than those who\nadhere to the choice theory, although the supposition that groups can\nhave interests has not gone unchallenged (Wall 2003, 273). Choice\ntheorists can extend rights to organised groups that possess\ndecision-procedures (Preda 2012; Sumner 1987, 209\u2013211), but some\nargue that even those groups are incapable of the agency required for\nright-holding (Wellman 1995, 157\u201365; Wall 2000, 2003,\n270\u20136; cf. Nickel 1997). Again, if sentience is a necessary\ncondition of right-holding, that may disqualify groups as\nright-holders: \u201cgroups are composed of sentient individuals, but\nthey do not themselves feel anything\u201d (Rainbolt 2006, 208. See\nalso Kymlicka 1989, 241\u20132; Ellis 2005, 206\u20137. For a\ncontrary view, see Graham 2002, 89\u2013104).\n\nMore simply, sceptics often suppose that crediting groups with rights\nentails ascribing groups irreducible moral standing as groups, a\nstanding that the sceptics reject. They do not deny the reality of\ngroups or their significance for human life but insist that, insofar\nas these give rise to rights, those rights can be adequately conceived\nas rights held individually by the members of groups. Indeed, that\nmust be so, since only individual humans can possess moral standing\nand only they therefore can possess moral rights. Michael Hartney\n(1991), for example, asserts \u201cvalue-individualism\u201d, the\nview that \u201conly lives of individual human beings have ultimate\nvalue\u201d; collective entities derive whatever value they have from\ntheir contribution to the lives of individual human beings (297).\nValue-individualism, Hartney argues, precludes the possibility of\nmoral group rights (see also Ellis 2005; Kukathis 1991; Narveson\n1991).\n\nFor the most part, scepticism about group rights presupposes a\ncorporate conception of those rights. It challenges claims that a\ngroup might have a being, status or value that is not reducible to\nthat of its members. But, since the collective conception makes none\nof those claims, it is largely untouched by that scepticism. It is\nnot, however, exempt from other sorts of objection.\n7. Fears of the implications or consequences of group rights\n\nWorries about the moral implications or consequences of ascribing\nrights to groups relate not only to whether we should accept that\ngroups have rights but also to how generously we should ascribe rights\nto them. The common thread running through these worries is the threat\nthat group rights might pose to individuals and their rights.\nSometimes the concern is for those inside, and sometimes for those\noutside, the right-holding group.\n\nOne concern is that, if we give moral standing to groups as such, we\nshall lose sight of individuals within the group (Vincent 1989, 714).\nIf a group can have standing as a group independently of its\nindividual members, those individuals will have no standing on any\nmatter on which the relevant standing lies with the group. On those\nmatters, the separate wills of individuals cannot count. They will not\nbe overridden; they will simply pass unrecognised. \n\nAnother fear concerns the power that a group may wield over its own\nmembers (e.g. Macdonald 1989; Offe 1998, 131\u20135; Waldron 1993,\n363\u20136). When we allow that a group has rights, those may be\nrights that enable it to regiment the lives of its members. Thus, once\nagain, group rights may function to the detriment of those who fall\nwithin the group. In one respect, that seems an unnecessarily\ninvidious way of representing the relationship between groups and\ntheir members. There is nothing unusual about a group\u2019s organising\nitself so that it can make decisions collectively, either directly or\nthrough appointees, that bind its members severally. That describes\nthe normal state of affairs for tennis clubs, anglers\u2019 associations,\npolitical parties, churches and any number of quite unremarkable\ngroups. The right of a group collectively to make decisions that bind\nits members severally is a simple description of democracy.\n\nSo why has there been so much angst about allowing that groups can\nhave rights over their members? The answer is that, in recent decades,\ngroup rights have been discussed primarily in relation to groups that\nhave involuntary memberships: groups that are distinguished by their\nrace, ethnicity, culture, or language. People do not choose to be\nmembers of these \u201cascriptive\u201d groups, nor can they easily\nleave them as they might leave a club or association. If they find the\ngroup\u2019s authority oppressive or its way of life intolerable, they\ncannot simply opt out, since their membership of the group is treated\nby others\u2014insiders or outsiders or both\u2014as a natural\n\u201cgiven\u201d to which normal rights of entry and exit do not\napply. That is why Will Kymlicka, for example, a liberal deeply\nsympathetic to the claims of cultural groups and indigenous peoples,\nis reluctant to allow that the rights of groups can be directed\ninwardly as restrictions upon the group\u2019s own members, rather than\noutwardly as protections against the external world (Kymlicka 1995,\n34-48; cf. Marmor 2001).\n\nConcerns about the potential for oppression implicit in group rights\nsometimes have an empirical dimension. Demands for group rights are\noften looked upon most favourably when they are made by indigenous\npeoples, cultural minorities and religious groups whose way of life is\nthreatened by external influences. But frequently, it is alleged, the\nreal effect of conceding rights to these sorts of group is to\nreinforce the power of conservative elites whose wishes and interests\nclash with those of others in the group. Typically, an elite will want\nto use its power to maintain the traditions and integrity of the group\nand will be unwilling to tolerate dissent, deviance and demands for\nreform. It will also seek to maintain the position of those within the\ngroup who have traditionally been subordinate. This issue is often\ndescribed as the problem of \u201cminorities within minorities\u201d\n(Eisenberg and Spinner-Halev 2005; Green 1994), but it can also be a\nproblem of majorities (e.g. women) within minorities. In short, while\naccording rights to a group may enhance the position of some of its\nmembers, it may seriously diminish the freedom and well-being of\nothers (Cohen et al. 1999; Deveaux 2000; Dick 2011; Kukathas 1992,\n113-15; Okin 2002; Shachar 2001; Tamir 1999, 158-64, 173-4). We should\nalso bear in mind, however, that withholding power from a sub-state\ngroup for that reason involves the assumption that the group\u2019s members\nwill be better served by the state\u2019s authority than by the authority\nof their group, an assumption that some would question (e.g. Holder\n2012).\n\nA closely related fear concerns the potential of group rights to rival\nand override the rights of individuals (e.g. Buchanan 1994; Caste\n1992; Graff 1994; Isaac 1992; Macdonald 1989, 126\u20137; Tamir 1999,\n161; Tes\u00f3n 1998, 132\u2013137). One of the strongest\nmotivations for ascribing rights to individual persons is to provide\nthem with safeguards. Individuals as individuals are vulnerable to\nthose who wield power in all of its many forms and to the might of\nnumbers. When we give rights to individuals, we provide them with\nmoral shields that protect them from the excesses of power, including\nexcesses of collective power. But, if we ascribe rights to groups, we\nmay discover that their rights override the rights of individuals, so\nthat rights lose their potency as safeguards for individuals. When the\nrights of a mighty group come up against those of a mere individual,\nGoliath rather than David may more frequently emerge as the\nvictor.\n\nThat concern is shared by List and Pettit (2011, 170\u201385). While\nthey hold that group agents as group persons should possess rights,\nthey also subscribe to value (or \u201cnormative\u201d)\nindividualism, the view that something is good only if it is good for\nindividual human beings or non-human sentient beings (182). On their\nview, value-individualism provides reason not to abandon group rights\n(as Hartney, 1991, alleges) but to curtail the scope of those rights.\nGroup persons should have only rights that will redound to the benefit\nof individual persons, be they members or non-members of the group.\nGiven the well-known dangers posed by asymmetries of power between\ngroups and individuals, we should accord groups a more limited set of\nrights than we accord individuals, though we have no reason similarly\nto curtail the responsibilities we assign groups. (For other views on\nvalue-individualism and the curtailing of group rights, see Hindriks\n2014; Pasternak 2017; Rafanelli 2017; Smith 2018).\n\nGroup rights conceived collectively may seem less threatening to\nindividuals than group rights conceived corporately. Because, on the\ncorporate conception, a group has moral standing independently of its\nmembers, its standing, will and interest can rival and override those\nof its individual members. A collective right by contrast, because it\nis held jointly by the individuals who make up the collectivity and is\ngrounded in their standing and interests, presents no similar danger.\nBut fear of collective rights may still be provoked by the way in\nwhich those rights derive from the aggregation of individual\ninterests. As we have already seen, on Raz\u2019s conception of collective\nrights, numbers count. Numbers affect both whether groups have rights\nand how weighty their rights are (1986, 187, 209). Others are loath to\naccept that rights can derive from, or be affected by, that sort of\naggregation (R\u00e9aume 1988, 2003; Tamir 1999, 166\u201371). In\ncontemporary philosophy, rights-thinking is commonly opposed to\nmaximizing consequentialism, of which utilitarianism is the prime\nexample. Ascribing rights to individuals is a way of acknowledging\ntheir separateness as persons and of safeguarding them from the\naggregative excesses of utilitarianism. But if the aggregation of\ninterests can yield collective rights, a morality of rights may begin\nto assume the character of, and to present the same dangers as, the\nvery sort of utilitarian thinking that many rights-theorists intend it\nto preclude, especially for those outside the right-holding group.\n8. Group rights and individual rights: co-existence and complementarity?\n\nA number of things might be said in response to these worries. First,\nvery much depends upon the content that we give group rights. It is\npossible to invest individual rights with a content that would make\nthem unsavoury, but that would not discredit the very idea of\nindividual rights; similarly, the possibility that we might find some\ngroup rights objectionable is no reason to dismiss group rights\naltogether. Secondly, it would seem strangely arbitrary, given the\nmoral significance that we give to rights, to insist that the objects\nof rights can be only goods that individuals can enjoy as independent\nindividuals and never goods they can enjoy only in association with\nothers. Some theorists of rights seem to think just that. But we\ncannot take for granted that no good, whose shared nature was such\nthat it could be the possible object only of a group right, could ever\nhave the significance that would justify its actually being the object\nof a right.\n\nThirdly, there is no reason why individual rights and group rights\nshould not both figure in our moral thinking. Indeed, they commonly\ndo. For example, it would be entirely commonplace to hold that a\npeople, as a political unit, has a collective right to be\nself-determining but only within the limits set by individuals\u2019 human\nrights. Group rights do not have to clash with individual rights and a\ncomplete moral theory would articulate individual rights and group\nrights so that they formed a coherent set (cf. Buchanan 1994; De\nFeyter and Pavlakos 2008; Holder and Corntassel 2002; Jones 2018). It\nmay prove impossible to anticipate and avoid every conflict amongst\nrights, but, even if it does, we need not suppose that conflicts will\narise more commonly between group rights and individual rights than\namongst individual rights themselves (McDonald 1998; Waldron 1993,\n203-24).\n\nThere is also a well-established tradition of political thought,\nassociated particularly with Alexis de Tocqueville and the English\nPluralists, which sees the existence of groups as essential to the\ndispersion of power and maintenance of liberty within a society.\nAccording to that tradition, groups do not glower threateningly at\nindividuals. Rather, the rights of groups help to counter and hold in\ncheck a potentially overmighty state. (Stapleton 1995; Lustgarten\n1983. See also Frohnen 2005 and Gedicks 1989.)\n\nGroup rights and individual rights can, then, co-exist more or less\npeacefully, but it is also possible for them to enjoy a more positive\nand mutually supportive relationship. Raz has pointed out that\nindividual rights frequently presuppose the existence of general\nsocial goods and individual rights themselves frequently promote\nsocial goods (1986, 193\u2013216, 245\u2013263; 1995). Indeed,\nindividual rights may sometimes be rights only because they promote\nsocial goods. Raz does not claim that those social goods are generally\nthe objects of group rights, but he does expose the error of supposing\nthat an antagonism towards collective considerations is somehow built\ninto the very idea or purpose of individual rights. The interests that\ngroup rights and individual rights seek to protect will frequently be\nthe same interests.\n\nIndeed, it may sometimes be an individual right that makes the case\nfor a group right. We might argue, for example, that some of the goods\nto which individuals have rights depend for their realisation upon the\nhealth of the communities and cultures to which those individuals\nbelong, so that there is a case for individuals sharing in group\nrights because those rights serve their individual rights or their\nindividual freedom (Jacobs 1991; Kymlicka 1989, 1995; Wellman 1999).\nOr we might argue that individuals have equal rights to the conditions\nof self-development, that individual self-development requires common\nor joint activity, and that that makes the case for group rights to\nthe conditions necessary for that common or joint activity (Gould\n2001). Or, again, we might hold that amongst the range of options\nrequired for individual autonomy are joint options, options to pursue\nends that require co-ordinated activity with other members of one\u2019s\ngroup; that too may justify group rights, such as the right of a group\nto control its own affairs (Wall 2007). The claim here might be either\nthat a group right is conducive to, or, more strongly, that it is\nessential for, the realisation of an individual right.\n\nNewman too argues that some individual rights presuppose group rights\n(2011, 76-82). His general analysis of the relationship between\nindividual and group rights is both nuanced and qualified (2011, Part\nII). As we have seen, he conceives right-holding groups as having\nrights grounded in their interests as groups, interests that are not\nreducible to the interests of their members taken severally. Even so,\nhe insists that group rights must be consistent with the\n\u201chumanistic principle\u201d, which holds that what matters\nultimately is the well-being of individual human persons. In that\nrespect, he is, like List and Pettit (2011), a value-individualist and\nnot, like Jovanovi\u0107 (2012), a value-collectivist. A group right\ncannot ultimately be in competition with the well-being of the group\u2019s\nmembers. He formulates that requirement as \u201cthe service\nprinciple\u201d: if the claims a group makes upon its members are to\nbe legitimate, those claims must serve the interests of the group\u2019s\nmembers. He pairs that with a \u201cmutuality principle\u201d: a\nright-holding group cannot act without regard for the well-being of\noutsiders, be they individuals or other groups. The service principle\ndoes not, however, translate into the familiar claim that individual\nrights must invariably displace group rights. People have interests\nboth as individuals and as group members and sometimes their interests\nas members may matter more than their interests as individuals. Newman\ntherefore cautions against supposing that compliance with his\nhumanistic principle means that group rights must always take second\nplace to individual rights.\n9. Group rights and human rights\n\nIn seeking to reconcile group rights and individual rights, should we\ntake a further step and deem some group rights to be human rights?\nSome international human rights documents already suggest that we\nshould. The preambles to the UN\u2019s Covenants on Civil and Political\nRights (1966) and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966)\ncharacterise the rights each Covenant recognises as human rights. The\nfirst articles of both Covenants ascribe to all \u201cpeoples\u201d\nthe right of self-determination, the right freely to dispose of their\nnatural wealth and resources, and the right not to be deprived of\ntheir means of subsistence. These are manifestly group rights but for\nthe Covenants they would also seem to be human rights. The UN\ninstrument that recognises collective human rights most expressly and\nabundantly is its Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,\n2007. The rights the Declaration announces include, for example, the\nrights of indigenous peoples \u201cto maintain and strengthen their\ndistinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural\ninstitutions\u201d (art.5), their right that their cultures shall not\nbe destroyed (art.8), and their right not to be forcibly removed from\ntheir lands and territories (art.10).\n\nThe mere existence of these international instruments does not, of\ncourse, establish that the ascription of human rights to groups is\neither conceptually coherent or morally defensible and, for the most\npart, drafters of UN human rights documents have studiously avoided\nany suggestion that human rights might be other than individually\nheld. For many commentators, human rights are necessarily and only the\nrights of human individuals; groups may possess rights but they will\nnot be human rights (e.g. Donnelly 2013, 45\u201354; Graff 1994;\nGriffin 2008, 256\u201376; Jovanovi\u0107 2012, 166\u2013195; Miller\n2002; Nickel 2007, 163\u2013167; Nordenfelt 1987; Waldron 1993,\n339\u201369). Others insist that some goods that are fundamental to\nhuman well-being are collective in nature and an adequate theory of\nhuman rights would accommodate that reality and recognise group as\nwell as individual human rights (e.g. Beitz 2009, 181\u2013186;\nCasals 2006; Crawford 1988; Felice 1996; Freeman 1995; Holder 2006;\nJones 1999b, 2013; Kymlicka 2001, 69\u201390; Malik 1996; Mende 2018;\nThompson 2015).\n\nWhere we stand on this issue may turn on what we understand a human\nright to be. The orthodoxy among moral and political philosophers has\nbeen that human rights are moral rights which individuals possess in\nvirtue of their humanity. If we opt instead for a purely legal\nconception of human rights (e.g. Buchanan 2013; Macklem 2015), the\nquestion of whether group rights might be human rights may be settled\nby legal fiat: if law declares a group right to be a human right, a\nhuman right it will be. Similarly, if we adopt a\n\u201cpolitical\u201d conception of human rights, according to which\na right is \u201chuman\u201d not because it is grounded in our\nhumanity but in virtue of the role it plays, or should play, in\ninternational political practice (e.g. Beitz 2009; Rawls 1999; Raz\n2010), group rights will figure among human rights if they are\nreckoned suitable for that role. But, if we stick with the traditional\nmoral conception of human rights and take the adjective\n\u201chuman\u201d seriously (e.g. Griffin 2008; Tasioulas 2007;\nWellman 2011), the possibility of group human rights remains\ncontroversial. Human beings are individual beings so that, if human\nrights are rights we hold as human beings, they would seem to be of\nnecessity individual rights. Moreover, the misgivings many people\nentertain about the potential of group rights to rival and threaten\nindividual rights are likely to be all the greater if the rights we\nascribe to groups are human rights which might match and override the\nhuman rights of individuals.\n\nThe main count on the other side of the argument is that many goods\nthat matter to human beings are collective in nature and many that are\nalready well-established objects of individual human rights have\ncollective dimensions. Consider, for example, collective acts of\nworship or other shared expressions of religious faith, or provision\nfor a minority\u2019s language in public documentation and public signage.\nIf these collective goods are objects of human rights, those rights\nwould seem to be of necessity group rights. UN documents sometimes\nseek to avoid that conclusion by distinguishing between the possession\nand the exercise of human rights. Individuals may exercise some human\nrights \u201cin community with others\u201d rather than individually\nbut the rights they exercise together will still be rights\nthey possess individually. But that distinction can be\ndifficult to maintain (Jones 2018, 2020). If, for example, a\npopulation engages in an act of collective self-determination, that\nact is not intelligible as the simultaneous exercise of so many\nindividually-held rights of individual self-determination; the act is\na collective act with a collective outcome and the right to perform it\ncan only be a group right. Similarly, a right to perform an integrated\nact of worship as an integrated act makes sense only as a\ngroup right. Individuals may possess individual rights to participate\nin the collective act but the right to stage the act of worship\nas a collective act will be a group right. If, with the\nVienna Declaration (1993, Part II, para. 22), we deem the human right\nto freedom of religion to include the right of religious communities\nthat their sacred sites shall not be desecrated, that too would seem\ninescapably to be a group right.\n\nThe distinction between the corporate and collective conceptions of\ngroup rights is of first importance here. A group right corporately\nconceived is a right held by the group as a corporate entity\npossessing moral standing as that entity. It is a right borne by an\nentity other than a human being and is therefore not plausibly a human\nright. A group right collectively conceived is a right held by\nindividuals, but a right held by those individuals jointly rather than\nindividually. So understood, a group right is readily intelligible as\na human right. Of course, not all collective rights will be human\nrights, just as not all individual rights are human rights. But a\nright need not fall outside the domain of human rights just because\nthe individuals who hold it do so collectively rather than\nindividually.\n\nWhat then of fears that ascribing human rights to groups will be to\nthe detriment of individuals and their human rights? If we ascribe\nhuman rights to groups understood as corporate entities, those fears\nare easily understood since potentially we pit the rights of two\ndifferent entities, groups and individuals, against one another. But,\nif we ascribe human rights to groups understood as collectivities, we\ndo nothing of the kind since the individuals who hold human rights\ncollectively will be the same individuals as those who hold human\nrights individually. The task of the human rights theorist will then\nbe to structure the entire set of human rights so that, for all who\nhold them, they constitute a morally optimal and compossible set.\n",
