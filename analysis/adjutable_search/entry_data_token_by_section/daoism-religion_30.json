Views of the Human Body\n\nIt is virtually impossible to distinguish the Daoist understanding of\nthe human body from its understanding of the human being as a whole,\nand this point constitutes on its own a central aspect of the Daoist\nway of seeing. Daoism is not interested in anatomy or physiology. The\nphysical body performs a different function: it supports various sets\nof metaphors that express the relation of the whole person to the\nultimate principle, the Dao.\n\nThe emphasis given to the symbolic aspects of the body is also the\nmain aspect under which Daoism differs from Chinese traditional\nmedicine: Daoism sees the body as an instrument for \u201creturning\nto the Dao\u201d. Catherine Despeux draws attention to this point by\nnoting that Daoists \n\n\nhave considered the body in its practical ends, in its uses,\ndeveloping all kinds of body techniques that intend to liberate the\nindividual from the constraints of the physical body, and consequently\nto entrust a major role to the symbolic body. (translated from Despeux\n1996: 87\u201388)\n\n",
