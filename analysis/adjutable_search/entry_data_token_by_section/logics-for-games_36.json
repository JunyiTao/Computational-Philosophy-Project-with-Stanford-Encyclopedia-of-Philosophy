    "main_text": "Interfacing Logic and Probability in Games || Specializing to Games\n5.4 Specializing to Games\n\nVirtually all aspects of game theory provide contacts between logical\nand probabilistic perspectives. Clearly, this is true for the\ndifferent representations of knowledge, beliefs and their dynamics\njust discussed. Other contacts occur at the level of game forms, cf.\n Section 2,\n where probabilities enrich the space of strategies. The resulting\nmixed moves require players to expand their preferences to mixed\noutcomes, cf.\n Section 3.\n Finally, at the level of reasoning about game play, cf.\n Section 4,\n probabilistic beliefs play a role in solution techniques such as\ndominance or expected utility based reasoning.\n\nAvailable actions and mixed strategies Probabilistic\nmixtures of pure strategies are prominent in game theory, as they can\nsecure outcomes and payoffs that no pure strategy alone could\nguarantee.\n\nExample Matching Pennies.\n\nConsider the well-known game of matching pennies in matrix form:\n\n\n\n\nBob\n\n\n\nx\ny\n\nAnn\na\n1,\u22121 \n\u22121, 1\n\nb\n\u22121,1\n1,\u22121\n\n\nFor Ann, a mixed strategy of playing a exactly half of the time\nguarantees an expected outcome of 0, no matter what Bob does. No pure\nstrategy could have achieved this.\n\nFrom a logical point of view, mixed strategies can be conceptualized\nas new primitive actions in the earlier logics of games ( cf.\n Section 2).\n Yet, this treatment immediately renders the set of available actions\ninfinite. A cautiously refined logical language, extending logical\napproaches to qualitative probability, can allow for expressions such\nas an agent playing action a with probability at least\nq, (Delgrande and Renne\n2015).\n\nA more challenging general question is how to relate classic\nprobabilistic approaches with their fixed-point results and ensuing\nequilibrium existence theorems, with the logical fixed-point\napproaches mentioned at several places in this entry. The latter\noperate with step-by-step ordinal iterations, as opposed to the\ngradual, approximative procedures that underlie the Brouwer or\nKakutani fixed-point theorems relevant for classical game theory. A\nrelated question is just how much logic is needed to reproduce\nprobabilistic existence theorems within a qualitative framework.\n\nAdding players\u2019 preferences Once preferences\nare added, mixed strategies trigger additional intricacies. A strategy\nprofile where some players pursue mixed strategies does not produce a\nunique outcome, but a weighted combination of outcomes. Thus,\npermitting mixed strategies requires lifting preference relations to\nprobabilistic mixtures of outcomes or strategy profiles. Incorporating\nsuch mixtures may implicitly depart from the standard, purely\nqualitative perspective on outcomes (Ramsey\n1931; Savage 1954).\n\nExample Extended preference comparison.\n\nThe following two games are equivalent in terms of qualitative (i.e.,\nordinal) preferences between outcomes for both players. However, they\ndiffer in preferences between mixed outcomes, with  \n\\[0.5(b,x)+0.5(b,y)\\succeq_A (a,x)\\]\n\n\nholding in the game to the left, but not in that to the right.\n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny \n\na\n1,0\n2,1 \n\nb\n0,1\n4,0  \n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny \n\na\n1,0\n2,1 \n\nb\n\u221210,1\n4,0  \n\n\n\nGoing this way poses some logical challenges. For example, consider a\npreference relation over probabilistic mixtures of outcomes, where\n\\(m^t(a,b)\\) stands for obtaining a with a probability of\nt, and b otherwise. This setting is in the scope of\nvon Neumann and Morgenstern\u2019s\n1944 well-known \u2018continuity\naxiom\u2019 that is characterized by an implicit infinite\ndisjunction:  \n\\[ {a \\preceq b\\preceq c} \\Rightarrow  {\\exists t \\in(0,1):\\ m^t(a,c)\\preceq b \\preceq  m^{1-t}(a,c)} \\]\n\n\nThis seems well beyond the expressive power of standard probabilistic\nlogics.\n\nSolution concepts and game play Probabilization also\nimpact the process of game play and its reasoning dynamics, for\ninstance by changing the earlier-mentioned calculus of weak and strong\ndominance\n (Section 3.4).\n Consider the following game, cf. de Bruin\n(2005):\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nx\ny\n\nA\na\n0, 5 \n5, 0\n\nb\n5, 0 \n0, 5 \n\nc\n1, 1 \n1, 1\n\n\nNone of A\u2019s strategies are dominated in terms of pure\nstrategies. However, in terms of expected outcomes, c is\ndominated by an equal mixture of a and b. Thus, solution\nprocedures analyzed earlier such as iterated removal of weakly or\nstrongly dominated strategies may provide different and incompatible\noutcomes, depending on whether mixed strategies are considered or not.\nNo satisfactory logical analysis of the earlier kind seems to exist\nfor this setting.\n",
