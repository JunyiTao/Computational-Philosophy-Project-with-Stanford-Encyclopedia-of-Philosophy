    "main_text": "Kaplan\u2019s Theory of Indexicals || Direct Reference and Rigid Designation\n3.5 Direct Reference and Rigid Designation\n\n\nKaplan (1989a) claims that indexicals are devices of direct\nreference. By this he means that the content of an\nindexical, with respect to a context \\(c\\), is the object to which\nit refers in \\(c\\); its content is not a property or descriptive\ncondition that determines the referent. For example, the content of\n\u2018I\u2019 in \\(c\\) is the agent of \\(c\\); its content\nin \\(c\\) is not the property or descriptive condition of being the\nagent of \\(c\\), or being the speaker of \\(c\\), or being the\nperson uttering \u2018I\u2019, or any other sort of property or\ndescriptive condition.\n\n\nKaplan (1989a) also says that indexicals are rigid\ndesignators. The notion of a rigid designator comes from Kripke\n(1980), who (roughly speaking) defines a rigid designator to be an\nexpression that designates the same thing with respect to all possible\nworlds. When Kaplan claims that indexicals are rigid designators, he\nmeans that if object \\(o\\) is the referent of expression\n\\(E\\) with respect to context \\(c\\) and the world of\n\\(c\\), then \\(o\\) is also the referent of \\(E\\) with\nrespect to \\(c\\) and any other world. For example, if Mary is the\nreferent of \u2018I\u2019 with respect to \\(c\\) and the world of\n\\(c\\), then Mary is also the referent of \u2018I\u2019 with\nrespect to \\(c\\) and any other world.\n",
