    "main_text": "The Equality of the Sexes\n4. The Equality of the Sexes\n\nWe have seen that Poulain claims that all human beings are equal, but\nhow does he argue for the equality of the sexes? We do not know if\nPoulain was familiar with Marie de Gournay\u2019s treatise\n\u00c9galit\u00e9 des hommes et des femmes [The Equality\nof Men and Women] (1622), but he shares her emphasis on equality based\non the similarity of the sexes. Gournay self-consciously distinguished\nherself from earlier participants in the querelle des femmes,\nwho often argued for the superiority of either sex, and emphasizes\nthat she is \u201ccontent to make women equal to men, for nature is\nalso as opposed to superiority as to inferiority in this\nrespect\u201d (G-EMW 54; G-OC 965; see also Deslauriers 2018).\nWhereas Gournay followed Aristotle and argued that the unique form of\nthe human animal consists in the rational soul, which is the same in\nboth sexes (G-EMW 65; G-OC 978; also Deslauriers 2019), Poulain\nrejected Scholastic philosophy and attempted to ground most of his\narguments on Descartes\u2019 philosophy. When we analyze his\ndiscussions of the equality of the sexes, we can distinguish four main\narguments. First, Poulain argues that there is no evidence in favor of\ninequality, which is a mere false belief. Second, he argues that women\nand men are in all relevant respects mentally and physically similar\nand therefor equal. Third, he refers to a normative concept of natural\nequality, and finally, he develops a normative demand for equal\nopportunity. I have devoted one subsection to each argument.\n",
