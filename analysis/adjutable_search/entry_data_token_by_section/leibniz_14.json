    "main_text": "Metaphysics: A Primer on Substance || Pre-established Harmony\n4.4 Pre-established Harmony\n\n\nWhile separate entries detail Leibniz's account of causation\nand his account of the mind, it will still be useful to provide a short\nexegesis of Leibniz's celebrated solution to the mind-body\nproblem which Leibniz had inherited from Descartes and his followers.\nThe problem, briefly, is this: if mind is essentially thought (and\nnothing else), and body is essentially extension, then how can mind and\nbody interact or form a unity as we know from experience they must? Or\nhow do thinking substance and extended substance unite in the substance\nof a human being? Leibniz answers this question by, first, denying the\npossibility of the causal interaction of finite substances. In this\nway, Leibniz undermines Cartesian dualism because it takes as a premise\nthe idea that mind-body interaction is to be explained by the influence\nof the one on the other via the pineal gland. (See the Sixth\nMeditation: AT VII 86\u201387/CSM II 59\u201360) But Leibniz also saw\npre-established harmony as an account of the mind-body relation that\navoided the difficulties inherent in Occasionalist theories of the mind\nand the interaction of substances. In one of Leibniz's best-known\nmetaphors, he asks his readers to imagine the mind and body as two\npendula hanging from a beam. Whence comes their agreement? One could\nimagine that the motion of the one is communicated through the wooden\nbeam to the other, thus causing them eventually to swing harmoniously\n(the theory of influx). Or one could imagine that God intervenes and\nmoves the pendula, guaranteeing their synchronicity (the theory of\noccasionalism). Or, Leibniz says, one could imagine that God, the\nsupreme artificer, created the world (and the pendula) so perfectly\nthat, by their own natures, they would swing in perfect harmony.\nNaturally, it is this last thesis that Leibniz endorses and asks his\nreaders to endorse as well. (See, for example, the Postscript of a\nLetter to Basnage de Beauval (G IV 498\u2013500/AG 147\u201349).)\n\n\nMore precisely, Leibniz argues that God created the world so\nperfectly that each substance acts according to its own law of\nunfolding and is at the same time in perfect harmony with all others\nsubstances; further, that the mind has a distinct point of view of the\nworld by virtue of its being the center of some mass (body), and that\nthe law of unfolding of the mind is in accord with the laws of the\ncorporeal machine. He puts this most succinctly in his 1695 essay,\nA New System of Nature, in which he effectively presents a\nfive-step argument for pre-established harmony:\n\n\n\n(1)\n\u201c[T]here is no real influence of one created\nsubstance on another.\u201d (G IV 483/AG 143)\n\n\n(2)\n\u201cGod originally created the soul (and any\nother real unity) in such a way that everything must arise for it from\nits own depths [fonds], through perfect spontaneity\nrelative to itself, and yet with a perfect conformity relative\nto external things.\u201d (G IV 484/AG 143)\n\n\n(3)\n\u201cThis is what makes every substance\nrepresent the whole universe exactly and in its own way, from a\ncertain point of view, and makes the perceptions or expressions of\nexternal things occur in the soul at a given time, in virtue of its\nown laws, as if in a world apart, and as if there existed only God and\nitself.\u201d (G IV 484/AG 143)\n\n\n(4)\n\u201c[T]he organized mass, in which the point of\nview of the soul lies, being expressed more closely by the soul, is in\nturn ready to act by itself, following the laws of the corporeal\nmachine, at the moment when the soul wills it to act, without\ndisturbing the laws of the other \u2013 the spirits and blood then\nhaving exactly the motions that they need to respond to the passions\nand perceptions of the soul.\u201d (G IV 484/AG 144)\n\n\n(5)\n\u201cIt is this mutual relation, regulated in\nadvance in each substance of the universe, which produces what we call\ntheir communication, and which alone brings about the\nunion of soul and body.\u201d (G IV 484\u201385/AG 144)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, when Leibniz speaks in metaphysical rigor, he denies the\nunderlying premise of Cartesian dualism: body is not a\nsubstance; so there can be no question of how it qua substance\ninteracts with or is related to the mind, or thinking substance.\nNevertheless, Leibniz was able to express his view for the vulgar\n\u2013 that is, for those expecting a Cartesian metaphysics \u2013 by\nsaying that the mind and body can be said to form a union and interact\ninsofar as the mind follows its laws, the body follows its laws, and\nthey are in perfect harmony. The body and soul are not united to each\nother in the sense that Descartes had suggested, but the perceptions\nand appetitions of the soul will arise spontaneously from\nits own stores and will correspond to the actions of the body as well\nas to the events of the world. In other words, while the perceptions\nand appetitions of the mind or soul will be independent of the body, they\nwill nevertheless correspond precisely to the actions of the particular\nbody to which it is attached and be in perfect conformity with all the\nother substances of the world.\n\n\nOn Leibniz's view, to individual substances there belong only\nperceptions and appetitions, and these perceptions and appetitions can\nbe understood to form a series within the individual substance. In\nother words, every individual substance can be thought to have a set\nof perceptions and appetitions such that one could say that, at any\ngiven time, a particular substance was experiencing such-and-such a\nperception and such-and-such an appetition. Indeed, Leibniz's view is\nthat a given substance, x, has, within its individual\nconcept, information of the following sort: x at\ntime t1 will have perception1 and/or\nappetition1; x at t2 will have\nperception2 and/or appetition2; and so on. (In\nfact, the position is more complex; for, as will be shown in a\nsubsequent section, the mind has at any moment an infinity of\npetites perceptions within it, perceptions of everything that\nis occurring in the universe, but the human mind at least will be truly\naware of one thing at a time. For example, the reader of this article\ncould be said to have a temporally-ordered series of perceptions\n\u2013 with t1 corresponding to the first sentence,\nt2 the second sentence, etc. \u2013 and also\n\u201cbackground noise\u201d of which the reader is not directly\naware \u2013 for example, the sound of an ambulance's siren\ngradually approaching and retreating from t1 to\nt3.) Moreover, the series of perceptions and appetitions are\ngenerated from within the individual substance itself. That is, Leibniz\nspeaks as if perceptions and appetitions follow naturally from prior\nperceptions and appetitions \u2013 and it is in this respect, after all,\nthat a finite individual substance is causally independent from all\nother finite created substances.\n\n\nThe crucial idea is that the body will follow its own laws, the mind\nits own laws, and there will be no true influence between the two. The\nmind and body thus seem to constitute, as it were, worlds apart, as\nindeed Leibniz claims later when he explains the world in terms of\nmonads, and these worlds apart are, according to Leibniz, unified\nsolely by virtue of the correspondence of their actions and\nperceptions. Further, to these separate realms there will apply two\ndistinct means of explaining the events of the world: we may explain\nthings according to the final causes of the mind or according to the\nefficient causes of the body or of bodies in general. Thus, not only do\nthe mind and body each seem to follow a different set of laws, but the\nworld, according to Leibniz, can be described in terms of either set of\nlaws.\n",
