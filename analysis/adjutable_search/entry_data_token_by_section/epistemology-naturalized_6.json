    "main_text": "Critical Reactions to Quine || Five objections\n3.1 Five objections\n\n(1) One natural response to Quine\u2019s \u201cEpistemology\nNaturalized\u201d is to see it as involving, in one or another way, a\ngross non sequitur. On one version, this is\nbecause Quine equates TE with Cartesian epistemology; whereas, by the\ntime of his writing, infallibilism had largely fallen out of fashion\n(e.g., Kim 1988: 386\u2013388; Van Fraassen 1995: 82). So too for the\nproject of \u201crational reconstruction\u201d, \u201can\nepistemological program\u201d, as Kelly puts it, \u201cthat had\nalready been abandoned by the time [Quine] wrote\u201d (2014: 24).\nInstead, by 1969 TE had largely turned to the now-familiar analytic\nprogram of suggesting definitions, or criteria for the application, of\nepistemic terms and concepts, revising these in light of\noften-imaginary counter-examples, and so on (Almeder 1990: 267). (A\nfair snapshot of the then-state of the art would be Knowing:\nEssays on the Analysis of Knowledge, edited by Roth & Galis\n1970.) So, whatever the merits of Quine\u2019s attack on the sort of\nstrong foundationalist program practiced by Descartes and the logical\nempiricists, they fail to motivate any rejection of TE as such.\n\n(2) A second objection is that Quinean naturalism is viciously\ncircular. Among the central tasks of epistemology, it\u2019s\nsaid, is to establish that empirical knowledge is possible\u2014that\nwe may, for example, legitimately rely upon empirical science as a\nsource of knowledge. However, Quine would have epistemologists make\n\u201cfree use\u201d of the results of science from the start.\n\n(3) A third, related objection is that Quine\u2019s response\nto skepticism is unsatisfactory. Insofar as the challenge\nposed by skepticism is to establish the possibility of knowledge,\nmaking use of certain methods of belief-formation, common-sensical or\notherwise, is hardly going to strike the skeptic as legitimate:\n\u201cSuch attempts to respond to the skeptic\u2019s concerns\ninvolve blatant, indeed pathetic, circularity\u201d (Fumerton 1994:\n338). Granted, Quine claims that skeptical arguments inevitably trade\non the fact of illusions, which would seem to make (other) appeals to\ncommon sense fair game. According to BonJour, however,\n\n\n[t]he fundamental skeptical move is to challenge the adequacy of our\nreasons for accepting our beliefs, and such a challenge can be mounted\nwithout any appeal to illusion. (1994: 288)\n\n\nAnd even in the case of illusions, skepticism requires only their\npossibility, not their reality (Stroud 1981, 1984: Ch. VI; compare\nFeldman 2012: Section 3).\n\n(4) Fourth, and perhaps best known, is the objection that, in\nrecasting epistemology as \u201ca chapter of psychology\u201d, Quine\nis stripping away any concern with epistemic\nnormativity. (Hence, that his endorsement of\nreplacement naturalism has eliminativism as a consequence.) The\ncomplaint here is not merely that normativity is a feature of\nTE\n (Section 1.1);\n it is that a concern with normative epistemic matters is\nessential to epistemology per se. Jaegwon Kim, the\nforemost author of this complaint, takes the abandonment of\nnormativity to be what\u2019s really distinctive about Quine\u2019s\nproposal:\n\n\nHe is asking us to set aside the entire framework of\njustification-centered epistemology. That is what is new in Quine\u2019s\nproposals. Quine is asking us to put in its place a purely\ndescriptive, causal-nomological science of human cognition. (Kim 1988:\n388)\n\n\nQuine does, of course, speak of NE as investigating \u201chow\nevidence relates to theory\u201d, but this claim is misleading. Since\n\u201cevidence\u201d here is proxy for certain causal-nomological\nrelations, the claim \u201csuggests a conflation of causal and\nevidential relations\u201d (Grandy 1994: 345; cf. Sellars 1956: Sec\n32; Siegel 1980: 318\u2013319; Lehrer 1990: 168\u2013172). Evidence as it relates to justification is what concerns the\nepistemologist. Justification is the central epistemic notion\u2014it\nmakes up the difference between mere true belief and knowledge\n(modulo Gettier), and is the locus of specifically epistemic\nnormativity. Thus, to jettison justification is to abandon any concern\nwith normativity; and without such a concern, whatever we\u2019re\ndoing, it\u2019s not deserving of the title\n\u201cepistemology\u201d:\n\n\n\u2026it is difficult to see how an \u201cepistemology\u201d that\nhas been purged of normativity, one that lacks an appropriate\nnormative concept of justification or evidence, can have anything to\ndo with the concerns of traditional epistemology. And unless\nnaturalized epistemology and classical epistemology share some of\ntheir central concerns, it\u2019s difficult to see how one could replace\nthe other, or be a way (a better way) of doing the other\u2026. For\nepistemology to go out of the business of justification is for it to\ngo out of business. (Kim 1988:\n 391)[8]\n\n\n(5) A final objection that has been presented in various forms (e.g.,\nBealer 1992, Kaplan 1994, BonJour 1994, Siegel 1984, Brandom 1998) is\nthat Quine\u2019s position is self-defeating. For\nexample, part of Quine\u2019s argument for the idea that \u201cthe\nold epistemology\u201d is doomed is his rejection of the a\npriori\u2014feature\n (a)\n of TE\n (Section 1.1).\n However, as Mark Kaplan puts it, to convince of us this, and of the\ndisreputability of \u201c[t]he a priorism involved in the traditional\nsort of armchair methodological research\u201d, \u201cwhat the\nproponents of naturalism have offered us is a series of\narguments\u201d (1994: 359). But it seems that nothing in\nepistemology as Quine conceives of it affords us the resources for\nevaluating such arguments:\n\n\n\u2026are [naturalists\u2019] arguments cogent? So long as\nthe naturalists mean to be showing their audience in spoken word and\nin print that their doctrines are correct, this question will be an\nurgent one. But how are we supposed to go about trying to answer it?\nWhat are we to do\u2014what can we do\u2014to decide whether the\nnaturalists\u2019 arguments are cogent?\n\nIt is hard to see what we can do except evaluate these arguments by\nthe light of the very sorts of epistemic intuitions which the\nnaturalists are so eager to disparage. (Kaplan 1994: 360; cf. Almeder\n1990: 266\u2013267)\n\n\nIn this way, NE itself requires or presumes the legitimacy of appeals\nto a priori or \u201carmchair\u201d intuition, such appeals\nbeing a key element within what George Bealer has called \u201cthe\nstandard justificatory procedure\u201d in philosophy (Bealer 1992).\nSo the position of the proponent of NE is\nself-defeating\u2014\u201cit seeks to justify naturalized\nepistemology in precisely the way in which, according to it,\njustification cannot be had\u201d (Siegel 1984: 675).\n",
