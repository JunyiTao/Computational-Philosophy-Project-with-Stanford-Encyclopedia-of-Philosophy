(This\nis why Aristotle often talks in term of a practical syllogism, with a\nmajor premise that identifies some good to be achieved, and a minor\npremise that locates the good in some present-to-hand situation.) At\nthe same time, he is acutely aware of the fact that reasoning can\nalways be traced back to a starting point that is not itself justified\nby further reasoning. Neither good theoretical reasoning nor good\npractical reasoning moves in a circle; true thinking always\npresupposes and progresses in linear fashion from proper starting\npoints. And that leads him to ask for an account of how the proper\nstarting points of reasoning are to be determined. Practical reasoning\nalways presupposes that one has some end, some goal one is trying to\nachieve; and the task of reasoning is to determine how that goal is to\nbe accomplished. (This need not be means-end reasoning in the\nconventional sense; if, for example, our goal is the just resolution\nof a conflict, we must determine what constitutes justice in these\nparticular circumstances. Here we are engaged in ethical inquiry, and\nare not asking a purely instrumental question.) But if practical\nreasoning is correct only if it begins from a correct premise, what is\nit that insures the correctness of its starting point?\n\nAristotle replies: \u201cVirtue makes the goal right, practical\nwisdom the things leading to it\u201d (1144a7\u20138). By this he\ncannot mean that there is no room for reasoning about our ultimate\nend. For as we have seen, he gives a reasoned defense of his\nconception of happiness as virtuous activity. What he must have in\nmind, when he says that virtue makes the goal right, is that\ndeliberation typically proceeds from a goal that is far more specific\nthan the goal of attaining happiness by acting virtuously. To be sure,\nthere may be occasions when a good person approaches an ethical\nproblem by beginning with the premise that happiness consists in\nvirtuous activity. But more often what happens is that a concrete goal\npresents itself as his starting point\u2014helping a friend in need,\nor supporting a worthwhile civic project. Which specific project we\nset for ourselves is determined by our character. A good person starts\nfrom worthwhile concrete ends because his habits and emotional\norientation have given him the ability to recognize that such goals\nare within reach, here and now. Those who are defective in character\nmay have the rational skill needed to achieve their ends\u2014the\nskill Aristotle calls cleverness (1144a23\u20138)\u2014but often the\nends they seek are worthless. The cause of this deficiency lies not in\nsome impairment in their capacity to reason\u2014for we are assuming\nthat they are normal in this respect\u2014but in the training of\ntheir passions.\n",
