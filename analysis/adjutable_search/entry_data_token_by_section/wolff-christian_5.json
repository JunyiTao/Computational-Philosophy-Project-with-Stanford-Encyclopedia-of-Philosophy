    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Ontology\n5.1 Ontology\n\nWolff\u2019s ontology is constructed on two foundational principles,\nnamely, the principle of contradiction [PC hereafter] and the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. According to Wolff, PC is the\nfundamental principle of human thought, the very first principle of\n\u201call metaphysical first principles\u201d, and the \u201cfont\n[or source] of all certitude\u201d (Ont. \u00a7\u00a754\u20135). It\nis regarded by him to be a self-evident first principle, its truth\nmade manifest through our inability to think in a manner contrary to\nit. In the Ontologia, he writes:\n\n\n\u00a727. We experience\u2026[PC]\u2026 in the nature of\nour mind, in that, while it judges something to be, it is impossible\nat the same time to judge the same not to be\u2026.\n\n\u00a728.\u2026[I]t cannot happen that the same thing simultaneously\nis and is not\u2026.\n\n\u00a730.\u2026[For] \u2026 contradiction is simultaneity in\naffirming and denying.\n\n\nPC is the \u201cfont of all certitude\u201d insofar as, if\nit were called into question, the most evident and secure judgments of\nhuman knowledge, such as knowledge of the self (as a thinking thing),\ncould likewise be called into question. We recognize the fact of our\nown existence by recognizing the psychological impossibility of\ndenying it. But if it were possible both to affirm and also deny our\nown existence (simultaneously), then the experience of certitude that\naccompanies this cognition would thereby be undermined.\n\nWolff contends that PC is not only for our thinking but, in\ndefining the limits of what is conceivable or not, also serves to\ndistinguish the possible from the impossible. So, impossibility,\ndefined formally, is that which involves a contradiction, whereas that\nwhich does not is taken to be possible. Now for Wolff,\n\u201cpossible\u201d and \u201cpossible thing\u201d are basically\nsynonymous terms. What is possible as a concept is simply reducible to\nwhat is possible as a thing. The realm of concepts and the ontological\nrealm of objects converge in the Wolffian system (Kuehn 1997). A thing\nor \u201cbeing\u201d is defined as \u201cthat which does not\ninvolve a contradiction\u201d (Ont. \u00a7135). A possible concept,\nconsequently, is that which corresponds to a possible object (Ont.\n\u00a7\u00a757, 59, 60). This analysis of the concept of the possible\ntypifies Wolff\u2019s non-existential and essence-centered approach\nto ontology. Very briefly, Wolff\u2019s understanding of being (or\nwhat is) involves regarding being in its most general sense. A being\nis \u201csomething\u201d if and only if it is intrinsically\npossible, and something is intrinsically possible, if and only if its\npredicates or \u201cdeterminations\u201d are not contradictory.\n\u201cNothing\u201d, in contrast, is simply a term that is empty of\nall content. In the ontological realm of objects there is literally\nno thing to which \u201cnothing\u201d corresponds (Ont.\n\u00a757). Nothing, by definition, is not thinkable or\nconceivable.\n\nOne important point to emphasize about Wolff\u2019s exposition of\nontology is that existence (or the actual reality of being) is\nregarded exclusively as a determination or \u201ccomplement\u201d of\na possible thing (Ont. \u00a7174). Although existing things are\nincluded in his overall description of reality, they are not as a\nclass of objects his primary focus. More accurately, existing objects\nfigure into Wolff\u2019s metaphysical account only insofar as\nexisting objects are a subset of possible things.\n\nWith the notions of \u201cpossible thing\u201d,\n\u201csomething\u201d, and \u201cnothing\u201d firmly in hand, we\ncan now explain the notion of reason (Grund or\nratio) that Wolff includes in his definition of philosophy.\nInsofar as the subject matter of philosophy concerns the realm of all\npossible things, Wolff believes that the task of the philosopher is to\nprovide \u201cthe manner and reason\u201d of their possibility.\nWarrant for this claim is grounded in the idea that everything,\nwhether possible or actual, has a \u201csufficient reason\u201d for\nwhy it is rather than not. In \u00a756 of his Ontologia, he\nwrites: \u201cBy sufficient reason we understand that from which it\nis understood why something is [or can be]\u201d. Unlike Leibniz who\nessentially restricts the notion of sufficient reason to\n\u201ccontingent truths of fact\u201d, Wolff considers the notion to\nhave a much broader scope of application to include the set of all\npossible objects and what Leibniz calls \u201cnecessary truths of\nreason\u201d. The idea that everything has a sufficient reason is\npresented formally by Wolff as the principle of sufficient reason.\n\nWolff\u2019s most extensive treatment of the PSR appears in\n\u00a7\u00a756\u201378 of his Ontologia. In this discussion,\nWolff appears to give two separate accounts of the theoretical origin\nof the principle. On the one hand, in \u00a770, Wolff provides a proof\n(or derivation) of PSR from PC and the notions of\n\u201csomething\u201d and \u201cnothing\u201d. And, on the other\nhand, in \u00a774, Wolff claims PSR is a principle of the\nhuman mind and a self-evident logical axiom. Although prima\nfacie, it is unclear why Wolff attempts to advance both views, it\nis perhaps worth pointing out the difference between (1) being able to\nbe demonstrate the truth of a proposition and (2) knowing the truth of\na proposition because it is self-evident. While demonstrating the\ntruth of a proposition yields knowledge of it, to know a proposition\nbecause it is self-evident may or may not mean the proposition is also\ndemonstrable. There is no inconsistency, for example, in holding that\none and same proposition is both self-evident and demonstrable. A\nproposition could be known immediately one way and yet, in another\nway, follow as a conclusion of a sound deductive argument.\n\nWolff believes that the fact that PSR obtains becomes\napparent when we consider three specific aspects of our\nrational/conscious experience. The first is that PSR is never\ncontradicted by experience; the second is that we can recognize\nsingular instances, or examples, of it in our experience of the world,\nand the third is that we have an inquisitive attitude toward our\nsurroundings and future life (Ont. \u00a7\u00a772\u20134). For Wolff,\nthese characteristics are not regarded as empirical evidence for\nPSR, but rather that PSR is a necessary\npresupposition for these characteristics to be a part of our conscious\nexperience. Thus by simply reflecting on the nature of our\nunderstanding of the world, Wolff believes that we arrive at the\nmanifest truth of PSR.\n\nNow according to Wolff there are at least four self-evident\n(axiomatic) principles of human thought: PC, the principle of\nexcluded middle, the principle of certitude (or principle of\nidentity), and PSR (Ont. \u00a7\u00a752\u201355). Of these,\nonly PC is indemonstrable in the sense that the truth of the\nprinciple cannot be proved to follow from a formal deductive\ninference. As we have seen, Wolff believes that we gain assurance of\nthe truth of this principle by attending to the psychological\nexperience of not being able to both affirm and deny our own existence\nin introspection. Thus only in a weak (and non-Wolffian) sense of\n\u201cdemonstration\u201d can Wolff be said to demonstrate the truth\nof PC. The remaining principles, however, are demonstrable in\nthe strict sense and each, he believes, can be derived from\nPC. His demonstration of PSR in \u00a770 of the\nOntologia is as follows:\n\n\nNothing exists without a sufficient reason for why it exists rather\nthan does not exist. That is, if something is posited to exist,\nsomething must also be posited that explains why the first thing\nexists rather than does not exist. For either (i) nothing exists\nwithout a sufficient reason for why it exists rather than does not\nexist, or else (ii) something can exist without a sufficient reason\nfor why it exists rather than does not exist (\u00a753). Let us assume\nthat some A exists without a sufficient reason for why it\nexists rather than does not exist. (\u00a756) Therefore nothing is\nto be posited that explains why A exists. What is more, A is admitted\nto exist because nothing is assumed to exist: since this is\nabsurd (\u00a769), nothing exists without a sufficient reason; and if\nsomething is posited to exist, something else must be assumed that\nexplains why that thing exists.\n\n\nThe crucial premise (italicized above) purports to reveal a\ncontradiction that follows from the assumption that something exists\nwithout a sufficient reason. Since \u201cnothing\u201d cannot both\nbe something and nothing at the same time (according to PC),\nthe conclusion (or PSR) is claimed to follow. This proof was\nthe subject of an incisive critique by Wolff\u2019s contemporary and\ncritic, Christian August Crusius (1715\u201375), who (among other\nthings) accuses Wolff of an equivocation with the term\n\u201cnothing\u201d, and once the two different meanings of this\nterm are identified (viz. nothing as the opposite of\nsomething, on one hand, and nothing as a non-being, on the other), the\nsupposed contradiction, purported to follow from the assumption,\ncannot be established (Crusius 1741).\n\nIn any case, for Wolff, the expression \u201cto provide the reason of\nsomething\u201d can be taken in two different ways. On the one hand,\nif the something for which a reason is provided is regarded solely as\na possible thing, then \u201creason\u201d stands to account for why\nthat thing (as a possible thing) is the possible thing that it is.\nAccording to Wolff, every being is endowed with an essential nature.\nPossible things have natures insofar as they as are comprised of a\nnumber of non-contradictory determinations or predicates. Different\nsets of determinations, and the relationships among these\ndeterminations, serve as the principle of individualization within the\nrealm of possible things. Hence, to provide the reason for a possible\nthing is simply to enumerate the determinations that make that thing\nthe kind of possible thing that it is. A reason, in this sense, is\nregarded by Wolff as ratio essendi or the \u201creason of\nbeing\u201d.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the something to which a reason is provided is\nan actual (i.e., existing) thing, then \u201creason\u201d stands to\nexplain why that thing as an actual thing comes into existence.\nReason, in this sense, is regarded as ratio fiendi or the\n\u201creason of becoming\u201d. Recall that for Wolff existence is\nsimply a predicate or determination of possible things. A familiar\nexpression appearing in Wolff\u2019s writings is that existence is\n\u201cthe complement of possibility\u201d (Ont. \u00a7174). The\nbasic idea here is that existence, as a predicate, perfects a possible\nthing by making it actual and a \u201creal individual\u201d. Real\nindividuals differ from nominal beings insofar as the former are\n\u201ccomplete and determinate\u201d. To be \u201ccomplete and\ndeterminate\u201d, in Wolff\u2019s sense of the expression, means\nthat every aspect or determination of a thing can be specified and\nthat its determinations are sufficient to individuate it from all\nother things. Nominal beings, although \u201ccomplete\u201d, are\nindeterminate (cf. GL: c. 1, \u00a715). That is to say, although there\nis a certain set of specifiable determinations that is sufficient to\npick out a given possible thing among all possible things, the total\nset of its determinations is not specifiable. A being, in the most\ngeneral sense, is comprised of three different types of\ndeterminations: essentialia, attributes, and modes. Essential\ndeterminations define the essential nature of a being and a\nbeing\u2019s attributes follow from, or are determined by, its\nessentialia. Whereas essentialia and attributes are\nboth necessary properties of a thing, modes are contingent or\naccidental properties. Thus to say a nominal being is indeterminate is\nto say that there are modes of it that may or may not be present. In\nthe weakest sense, since existence is a mode, and nominal beings do\nnot exist (as such) but are able to come into existence under certain\nconditions, all nominal beings are indeterminate.\n\nDiscerning the difference between the \u201creason of being\u201d\nand the \u201creason of becoming\u201d is important for\nunderstanding the different ways Wolff employs PSR in his\nexposition of metaphysics. Depending on how exactly\n\u201creason\u201d is interpreted, the principle, \u201cnothing is\nwithout a sufficient reason for why it is rather than not\u201d may\napply either to the realm of possibility or to the realm of actual\nreality. Toward the end of his Ontologia, Wolff makes an\nattempt to recognize formally two different versions of PSR\nas \u201cthe Principle of Being\u201d and \u201cthe Principle of\nBecoming\u201d respectively (Ont. \u00a7866). As a Principle of\nBeing, PSR stands as a definition of a thing\u2019s\nessential nature. Yet as a Principle of Becoming, PSR serves\nto furnish the causes, or grounds, for why a real individual comes\ninto actuality.\n\nIt is on the basis of PC and PSR that Wolff proceeds\nto explicate the fundamental concepts of his ontology. Recall that for\nWolff a being in the most general sense is any possible thing.\nPossible things have essential natures insofar as they are composed of\na number of non-contradictory determinations or predicates. The\nessence of any given possible thing is its principle of being, or\nprinciple of individualization. Whereas the essence of a simple being\nis defined by its essential properties, the essence of a composite\nbeing is defined by the manner in which its parts are combined\ntogether. In \u00a7532 of his Ontologia, Wolff explains:\n\n\nA being is called composed which is made up of many parts distinct\nfrom each other. The parts of which a composite being is composed\nconstitute a composite through the link which makes the many parts\ntaken together a unit of a definite kind.\n\n\nIn one respect, simple beings and composite beings are not simply two\ndifferent species of beings. It is not the case, for example, that\nwithin the realm of all possible things simple beings exist separate\nfrom, and in addition to, composite beings. More accurately, at the\nnominal level of reality simples and composites result from an\nepistemological distinction imposed by a perceiving mind in its\nanalysis of what \u201cexists\u201d (i.e., exists in a nominal\nsense). Strictly speaking, the only substantial things to exist at any\nlevel of reality are simple substances. Simples are defined by their\nessentialia, and to borrow an expression from Gilson,\nessentialia are both \u201ccompatible and prime\u201d\n(Gilson 1952: 114). That is to say, the essential properties that\ndefine a given simple substance do not contradict one another, or\ncancel each other out, and they are (themselves) not determined by any\nother thing and/or property. In this light, Wolff\u2019s notion of\nsubstance is perhaps best regarded as a notion of essence, where each\nsimple substance is a different set of compatible and prime essential\nproperties (see Burns 1966: 26 and Gilson, 1952: 115). Furthermore,\nessential properties should not be viewed as the accidents of\nsubstance because, according to Wolff, they are the substance itself.\nIn Wolff\u2019s system, the accidents of substance are the properties\nthat exist by virtue of a thing\u2019s essentialia. And\naccording to Wolff, there are three basic classes of accidents: proper\nattributes, common attributes, and modes (Ont. \u00a7148).\n\nProper and common attributes of substance follow from and are\ndetermined by a thing\u2019s essentialia. Proper attributes\nare the properties of a thing that are determined by all the\nessentialia taken together, and common attributes are the\nproperties of a thing that are determined by only some, but not all,\nits essentialia. Attributes (as such) are perhaps best\nunderstood as necessary accidents, since they are determined by and\nnecessarily follow from a thing\u2019s essentialia. Modes,\nin contrast, are only contingent accidents of substance. They are the\nproperties of a thing that may or may not be present, and if actually\npresent, they are causally the result of some contingent state of\naffairs. More precisely, the possible presence of any given mode\nfollows from a substance\u2019s essentialia, but the actual\npresence of a given mode is the result of something outside the\nsubstance\u2019s essence that is causally responsible for its\npresence in a being. At the nominal level of reality, composite beings\nexist insofar as the accidents of a certain simple substance, or set\nof simple substances, are linked and/or arranged together in a certain\nsort of way. In \u00a7789 of his Ontologia, Wolff writes:\n\n\n\n[t]he essence of a composite being consists only in mere accidents for\nthe essence of a composite consists in the manner in which its parts\nare combined with one another.\n\n",
