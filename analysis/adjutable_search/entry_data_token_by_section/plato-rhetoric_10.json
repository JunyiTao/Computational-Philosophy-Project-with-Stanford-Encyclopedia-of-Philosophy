    "main_text": "Phaedrus || Rhapsodes, Inspiration, and Poetry in the Phaedrus\n6. Plato\u2019s Dialogues as Rhetoric and Poetry\n\nPlato\u2019s critique of writing on the grounds that it is a poor form of\nrhetoric is itself written. Of course, his Socrates does not know that\nhe is \u201cspeaking\u201d in the context of a written dialogue; but\nthe reader immediately discerns the puzzle. Does the critique apply to\nthe dialogues themselves? If not, do the dialogues escape the critique\naltogether, or meet it in part (being inferior to \u201clive\u201d\ndialogue, but not liable to the full force of Socrates\u2019 criticisms)?\nScholars dispute the answers to these well-known\n questions.[32]\n\nThere is general agreement that Plato perfected\u2014perhaps even\ninvented\u2014a new form of discourse. The Platonic dialogue is a\ninnovative type of rhetoric, and it is hard to believe that it does\nnot at all reflect\u2014whether successfully or not is another\nmatter\u2014Plato\u2019s response to the criticisms of writing which he\nputs into the mouth of his Socrates.\n\nPlato\u2019s remarkable philosophical rhetoric incorporates elements of\npoetry. Most obviously, his dialogues are dramas with several formal\nfeatures in common with much tragedy and comedy (for example, the use\nof authorial irony, the importance of plot, setting, the role of\nindividual character and the interplay between dramatis\npersonae). No character called \u201cPlato\u201d ever says a\nword in his texts. His works also narrate a number of myths, and\nsparkle with imagery, simile, allegory, and snatches of meter and\nrhyme. Indeed, as he sets out the city in speech in the\nRepublic, Socrates calls himself a myth teller\n(376d9\u201310, 501e4\u20135). In a number of ways, the dialogues\nmay be said to be works of fiction; none of them took place exactly as\npresented by Plato, several could not have taken place, some contain\ncharacters who never existed. These are imaginary conversations,\nimitations of certain kinds of philosophical conversations. As reader, one\nis undoubtedly invited to see oneself reflected in various\ncharacters, and to that extent identify with them, even while also\nfocusing on the arguments, exchanges, and speeches. Readers of Plato\noften refer to the \u201cliterary\u201d dimension of his writings,\nor simply refer to them as a species of philosophical literature.\nExactly what to make of his appropriation of elements of poetry is\nonce again a matter of long discussion and\n controversy.[33]\n\nSuffice it to say that Plato\u2019s last word on the critique of poetry and\nrhetoric is not spoken in his dialogues, but is embodied in the\ndialogue form of writing he brought to perfection.\n",
