    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Fictional Entities\n1. The Metaphysics of Fictional Entities\n\nAs Thomasson (1999: 5) puts it, the first question amounts to asking:\nwhat would fictional entities be if there were any? Different answers\nhave been proposed to this question. But however much the answers\ndiffer, they all try to accommodate in some way or other what seems to\nbe an intuitive datum facing philosophers who theorize about fictional\nentities: these entities lack existence, or at least existence as\nordinary physical objects. According to this datum\u2014call it\nthe nonexistence datum\u2014paradigmatic objects of fiction\nlike Hamlet and Holmes do not exist. In support of this datum, note\nthat the layperson would almost certainly answer No to the\nquestion of whether such objects exist, although she might qualify\nthis answer by allowing that there may be another sense in which they\ndo (Barbero et al. 2023). We also appeal to nonexistence in this sense\nwhen we want to dispute the view that some alleged individual is a\ngenuine historical figure; we might say, for example, that King Arthur\ndoes not exist, thereby underlining our view that a search for a\nhistorical King Arthur would be in vain.\n\nThose who do not believe that there are any fictional entities\n(fictional antirealists, as we shall call them) will claim\nthat the nonexistence datum has an ontological reading only:\nto say that fictional entities do not exist amounts to saying that in\nthe overall domain of what there is there are no such things as\nfictional entities. As they see it, fictional realists (those\nwho do believe that there are fictional entities) are the only ones to\ngive the datum a certain metaphysical reading, namely that\nfictional entities have the property of not existing (in some\nsense or other). They might also insist that fictional realists are\nthe only ones to think that the nonexistence of fictional entities is\ndetermined by their nature as fictional entities. But this overstates\nthe case. Because they hold that there are no such things as fictional\nentities, even antirealists are likely to admit that the fact that\nthere is no such thing as some alleged entity X follows from\nthe fact that X has been shown to be fictional. That is what\nhappened in the case of King Arthur and many other legendary or\nmythological entities (fictional entities in the broad sense). People\noriginally supposed that King Arthur was a real person, a British\nleader who ruled England after the departure of the Romans (cf.\nGeoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s Historia Regum Britanniae),\nuntil it was discovered that King Arthur is merely a figure of legend,\na fictional entity. It was this discovery that licensed the conclusion\nthat King Arthur doesn\u2019t exist. So it seems that even\nantirealists have a stake in the answer to the metaphysical question\n\u201cWhat would it take for something to be a fictional\nentity?\u201d\n\nOne further comment about the nonexistence datum before we turn to\nvarious accounts of fictional objects and the ways in which such\naccounts cope with the datum. As we have already seen, it is natural\nwhen discussing the datum to use quantifiers such as \u201cSome\nthings are \u2026\u201d (\u201cThere are things that are\n\u2026\u201d), and \u201cEverything is\u2026\u201d, whose\ndomain appears to include both existent and nonexistent objects. We do\nso when we say, for example, that there are objects, such as\nfictional objects, that don\u2019t exist. Fictional antirealists will\ntake such talk with a grain of salt, since they do not acknowledge a\nsense in which there really are any fictional objects. Fictional\nrealists, on the other hand, will think that a sentence like\n\u201cThere are objects, among them Hamlet and Holmes, that\ndon\u2019t exist\u201d is either literally true or at least it\nconveys a truth. They typically acknowledge a distinction between\nunrestricted quantifiers, whose domain includes even nonexistent\nobjects, and restricted quantifiers, whose domain includes only\nexistent objects (cf., e.g., Berto 2013).\n",
