    "main_text": "Other Pythagoreans of the Sixth, Fifth and Fourth Centuries || The Earliest Pythagoreans: Brontinus, Theano, etc.\n3.2 The Earliest Pythagoreans: Brontinus, Theano, etc.\n\nIn the standard collection of the fragments and testimonia of the\nPresocratics, Cercops, Petron, Brontinus, Hippasus, Calliphon,\nDemocedes, and Parmeniscus are listed as older Pythagoreans (DK I\n105\u2013113). Hippasus, who is the most important of these figures,\nwill be discussed separately below (sect. 3.4). Of the rest only\nBrontinus, Calliphon and Parmeniscus appear in Iamblichus\u2019\ncatalogue.\n\nBrontinus is presented as either the husband or father of Theano (see\nsection 3.3 below). Brontinus (DK I 106\u2013107) is elsewhere said\nto have had a wife Deino and to be either from Metapontum or Croton.\nLittle is known about him, but his existence appears to be confirmed\nby Alcmaeon, writing in the late sixth or early fifth century, who\naddresses his book to a Brontinus along with Leon and Bathyllus (Fr. 1\nDK). The latter two may also be Pythagoreans, since a Leon is listed\nunder Metapontum and a Bathylaus (sic) under Posidonia, in\nIamblichus\u2019 catalogue.\n\nThe elusive connection between Orphism and Pythagoreanism rears its\nhead with Brontinus. In late antiquity there was a consensus that\nPythagoras himself had been initiated into the Orphic mysteries and\nderived much of his philosophy from Orphism (Proclus, Commentary\non Plato\u2019s Timaeus, 3.168.8). Authors of the fifth century\nBCE know of no such initiation and often indicate that the influence\nwent the other way by reporting that Pythagoras was, in fact, the\nauthor of supposed Orphic texts (Ion of Chios as reported in Diog.\nLaert. 8.8). Similarly, the fourth-century author, Epigenes, reports\nthat Brontinus is supposed to be the real author of two works\ncirculating in the name of Orpheus (West 1983, 9 ff.). In the end it\nis impossible to determine the relationship between Pythagoreanism and\nOrphism because of the difficulty of defining either movement\nprecisely (see Betegh 2014).\n\nCercops (DK I 105\u2013106) is an even more obscure figure who is,\nagain according to Epigenes, the supposed Pythagorean author of Orphic\ntexts (West 1983, 9, 248), although Burkert doubts that he was a\nPythagorean (1972a, 130).\n\nTo Petron (DK I 106) is ascribed the startling doctrine that there are\n183 worlds arranged in a triangle, but he is only known from a passage\nin Plutarch, is not called a Pythagorean there and is probably a\nliterary fiction (Guthrie 1962, 322\u2013323; Burkert 1972a, 114;\nZhmud 2012a, 117).\n\nA Parmeniscus (DK I 112\u2013113) is called a Pythagorean by Diogenes\nLaertius (IX 20) and may be the same as the Parmiskos listed under\nMetapontum in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue. Athenaeus reports that a\nParmeniscus of Metapontum lost the ability to laugh after descending\ninto the cave of Trophonius, only to recover it in a temple on Delos,\nwhere the surviving inventory of the temple of Artemis records a\ndedication of a cup by a Parmiskos (Burkert 1972a, 154).\n\nThere no good reason to think that Democedes (DK I 110\u2013112), the\nphysician from Croton, was himself a Pythagorean, although he had some\nPythagorean connections. He is famous from Herodotus\u2019 account\n(III 125 ff.) of his service to the tyrant, Polycrates, and the\nPersian king, Darius. One late source names him a Pythagorean (DK I\n112.21). Iamblichus mentions a Pythagorean named Democedes, who was\ninvolved in the political turmoil surrounding the conspiracy of Cylon\nagainst the Pythagoreans, but it is far from clear that this was the\nphysician (VP 257\u2013261). Herodotus never calls Democedes\na Pythagorean nor do any other of the later sources (e.g., Aelian,\nAthenaeus, the Suda), nor does he appear in Iamblichus\u2019\ncatalogue. A Calliphon, who could be Democedes\u2019 father, is\npresented as an associate of Pythagoras by Hermippus (DK I 111.36 ff.)\nand appears in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue, so it is reasonable to\nregard him as a Pythagorean, although we know nothing more of him. It\nis reported (Herodotus III 137) that Democedes married the daughter of\nthe Olympic victor, Milon, who was the Pythagorean, whose house was\nused as a meeting place (Iamblichus, VP 249). It was\nundoubtedly because Democedes came from Croton at roughly the time\nwhen Pythagoras was prominent there and because of the Pythagorean\nconnections of his father and father-in-law that late sources came to\nlabel Democedes himself a Pythagorean. For an argument that Democedes\nwas a Pythagorean see Zhmud 2012a, 120.\n",
