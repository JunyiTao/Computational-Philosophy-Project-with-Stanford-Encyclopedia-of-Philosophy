Philosophical Influences\n\n\nAmong Buber\u2019s early philosophical influences were Kant\u2019s\nProlegomena, which he read at the age of fourteen,\nand Nietzsche\u2019s Zarathustra. Haunted by the seeming infinity of space and time, Buber found solace in Kant\u2019s understanding that\nspace and time are mere forms of perception that structure the \nmanifold of sensory impressions. At the same time, Kant allows to think of being as transcending the pure forms of human intellection. Buber\u2019s mildly religious reading of Kant, which seems both conventional and autodidactic, seems to have been untrammeled by the debates between the various schools of neo-Kantianism that developed since the 1860\u2019s and came to dominate much of the academic teaching of philosophy across Germany until the First World War. From Nietzsche and Schopenhauer Buber\nlearned the importance of the will, the power to project oneself\nheroically into a fluid and malleable world, and to do so according to\none\u2019s own measure and standard. Though Buber\u2019s philosophy\nof dialogue is a decisive step away from Nietzschean vitalism, the\nfocus on lived experience and embodied human wholeness, as well as the\nprophetic tone and aphoristic style Buber honed from early on,\npersisted in his subsequent writings. Between 1896 and 1899 he studied the\nhistory of art, German literature, philosophy, and psychology in\nVienna, Leipzig (1897/98), Berlin (1898/99), and Zurich (1899). In Vienna he\nabsorbed the oracular poetry of Stefan George, which influenced him\ngreatly, although he never became a disciple of George. In Leipzig and\nBerlin he developed an interest in the ethnic psychology (V\u00f6lkerpsychologie) of Wilhelm\nWundt, the social philosophy of Georg Simmel, the psychology of Carl\nStumpf, and the lebensphilosophische approach to the\nhumanities of Wilhelm Dilthey. In Leipzig he attended meetings of the\nSociety for Ethical Culture (Gesellschaft f\u00fcr ethische\nKultur), then dominated by the thought of Lasalle and\nT\u00f6nnies.\n\n\nFrom his early reading of philosophical literature Buber retained some\nof the most basic convictions found in his later writings. In Kant he\nfound two answers to his concern with the nature of time. If time and\nspace are pure forms of perception, then they pertain to things only\nas they appear to us (as phenomena) and not to\nthings-in-themselves (noumena). If our experience\nof others, especially of persons, is of objects of our experience,\nthen we necessarily reduce them to the scope of our phenomenal\nknowledge, in other words, to what Buber later called\nthe I-It relation. Yet Kant also indicated ways of\nmeaningfully speaking of the noumenal, even though not in terms of\ntheoretical reason. Practical reason \u2013 as expressed in \"maxims of action,\" categorical imperatives, or principles of duty we choose for their own sake and regardless of outcome \u2013 obliges us to consider persons as ends in themselves rather than means to an end. This suggests something like an absolute\nobligation. Teleological (aesthetic) judgment, as developed in Kant\u2019s\nThird Critique, suggests the possibility of a rational grounding of\nrepresentation. Taken together, Kant\u2019s conceptions of ethics and\naesthetics resonated with Buber\u2019s notion that the phenomenon is always\nthe gateway to the noumenon, just as the noumenal cannot be\nencountered other than in, and by way of, concrete phenomena. Thus Buber\nmanaged to meld Kantian metaphysical and ethical conceptions into a\nmore immediate relation with things as they appear to us and as we\nrepresent them to ourselves. Buber succeeded in translating this theoretical dialectic of immediacy and distance, phenomenal encounter and reflexivity, into a style he cultivated in his writing but also in his manner of personal interactions. Buber sought not only to describe but to live the tension between a Dionysian primacy of life in its particularity, immediacy, and individuality and the Apollonian world of form,\nmeasure, and abstraction as inter-dependent forces. Both are constitutive of\nhuman experience in that they color our interactions with the other in\nnature, with other human beings, and with the divine Thou. Buber thus developed his own distinctive voice in the emerging chorus of writers, thinkers, and artists of his time who rallied against the widely-perceived \"alienation\" associated with modern life.\n",
