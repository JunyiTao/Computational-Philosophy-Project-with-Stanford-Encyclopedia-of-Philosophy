    "main_text": "\n\nThe notion of a \u201cmental representation\u201d is, arguably, in\nthe first instance a theoretical construct of cognitive science. As\nsuch, it is a basic concept of the Computational Theory of Mind,\naccording to which cognitive states and processes are constituted by\nthe occurrence, transformation and storage (in the mind/brain) of\ninformation-bearing structures (representations) of one kind or\nanother.\n\nHowever, on the assumption that a representation is an object with\nsemantic properties (content, reference, truth-conditions,\ntruth-value, etc.), a mental representation may be more broadly\nconstrued as a mental object with semantic properties. As such, mental\nrepresentations (and the states and processes that involve them) need\nnot be understood only in cognitive/computational terms. On this\nbroader construal, mental representation is a philosophical topic with\nroots in antiquity and a rich history and literature predating the\nrecent \u201ccognitive revolution,\u201d and which continues to be\nof interest in pure philosophy. Though most contemporary philosophers\nof mind acknowledge the relevance and importance of cognitive science,\nthey vary in their degree of engagement with its literature, methods\nand results; and there remain, for many, issues concerning the\nrepresentational properties of the mind that can be addressed\nindependently of the computational hypothesis.\n\nThough the term \u2018Representational Theory of Mind\u2019 is\nsometimes used almost interchangeably with \u2018Computational Theory\nof Mind\u2019, I will use it here to refer to any theory that\npostulates the existence of semantically evaluable mental objects,\nincluding philosophy\u2019s stock-in-trade mentalia \u2013 thoughts,\nconcepts, percepts, ideas, impressions, notions, rules, schemas,\nimages, phantasms, etc. \u2013 as well as the various sorts of\n\u201csubpersonal\u201d representations postulated by cognitive\nscience. Representational theories may thus be contrasted with\ntheories, such as those of Baker (1995), Collins (1987), Dennett\n(1987), Gibson (1966, 1979), Reid (1764/1997), Stich (1983) and Thau\n(2002), which deny the existence of such things.\n",
