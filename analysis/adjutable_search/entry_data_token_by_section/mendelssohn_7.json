    "main_text": "Language\n8. Language\n\nMendelssohn finds linguistic considerations at the very heart of\ntraditional philosophical questions. As noted above (\u201c2.\nMetaphysics and epistemology\u201d), in the Prize Essay he\nregards metaphysics\u2019 greater reliance upon arbitrary signs as\none reason for its slow progress (relative to that in mathematics) and\nin Morning Hours he indicates his inclination to regard\ndisputes over idealism as purely verbal. Joining these remarks about\nthe import of language for philosophy are two main treatments of\nlanguage, one at the beginning, the other at the end of his career. At\nthe outset he critically addresses Rousseau\u2019s views on the\norigin of language in the context of the Berlin Academy\u2019s essay\ncompetitions on language (see Sendschreiben an den Herrn Magister\nLessing in Leipzig, the appendix to the translation of\nRousseau\u2019s Discours sur les origins de\nl\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 (1756), and Mendelssohn\u2019s\nreview of Michaelis\u2019 prize-winning essay (1759) in Briefe,\ndie neueste Literatur betreffend and \u201c\u00dcber die\nSprache\u201d (circa 1759)). Michaelis won the Academy\u2019s prize\nfor answering its question: \u201cQuelle est l\u2019influence\nr\u00e9ciproque des opinions d\u2019un people sur le langage et du\nlangage sur les opinions?\u201d). Mendelssohn takes issue both with\nRousseau\u2019s attempt to explain the origin of human language on\nthe basis of a description of the natural condition that human beings\nshare with other animals and with his neglect of any consideration of\nthe providential character of the development of language\n(Gesammelte Schriften 6/2, p. 27). In these early writings on\nlanguage, Mendelssohn emphasizes the interdependence of language and\nits development with the development of innate, divinely-endowed\ncapacities. These capacities include not only reason as the ability to\ngrasp conceptual connections and employ arbitrary signs\n(Gesammelte Schriften 6/2, pp. 9f), but also \u2014 in\ntandem with the development of rational capacities \u2014 the\ncapacity for compassionate interaction in familial and social\nsettings. Thus, on the one hand, the recurrence of auditory, visual,\nand gesticular phenomena enables reason to signify phenomena bearing\nno resemblance to them and, indeed, to do so in a way decidedly\ndifferent from how other animals instinctively employ natural,\nimitative signs (Gesammelte Schriften 6/2, p. 10). In this\nmanner Mendelssohn underlines the interdependence of reason and\nlanguage, understood as the use of arbitrary signs. On the other hand,\nlanguage develops within a process that is social as well as cognitive\nand the starting point for the investigation of its origins is the\nfamily rather than the individual. Borrowing from Condillac and\nchallenging Rousseau\u2019s view of language as primarily a tool for\nsocialization, Mendelssohn writes: \u201cThe drive to social life is\nequally innate in human beings and leads immediately to the occasion\nfor exercising the capacity for language\u201d(Gesammelte\nSchriften 6/2, p. 8).\n\nIn Jerusalem, toward the end of his career, Mendelssohn\nreturns to the subject of language in the context of articulating the\nsense in which Judaism is \u2014 for good reasons \u2014 a religion\nof the spoken rather than the written word, relying on an a living\ntradition to transmit and interpret divine legislation. In this\ncontext Mendelssohn again emphasizes the fundamentally social\ncharacter of language in the context of the performance of rituals,\nwhile calling attention to both the feebleness of ostensive definition\nand the fraught prospects for maintaining the same reference for words\nover time. In the course of arguing that human reason does not need\nsupernatural revelation in order to recognize the eternal truths\nindispensable to its happiness, Mendelssohn notes that Judaism relies,\nnot upon written phrases or formulations that are \u201cestablished\nforever, immutable,\u201d but instead upon a \u201cliving tradition\npassed on by oral instruction,\u201d capable of keeping pace with\nchanging times and circumstances (Jerusalem (1983), p. 97f,\n102f (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte Schriften 8,\npp. 160, 168). Judaism is thus for Mendelssohn primarily a religion of\nthe spoken word precisely as a means of maintaining its relevance to\nreal life in changing, historical contexts and maintaining the\npersonal bonds and Jewish identity among its members (see Sacks\n2017).\n\nMendelssohn adds a further reason for insisting that Judaism is a\nreligion of the spoken word, precisely as a supernatural legislation\nrather than a revealed religion. The constant attention paid to the\nwritten word not only can isolate human beings from one another and\nspeculation from practice, but also can induce a kind of idolatry.\nFrozen in time, the written word can become an idol itself, obscuring\nthe distinction between itself and what it is meant to signify (see\nFreudenthal (2012), pp. 105\u2013134).\n\nIn this connection Mendelssohn conjectures that written language\nemerged in the course of the development of visible signs, beginning\nwith a form of synecdoche where a concrete object reawakens the\nthought of a particular characteristic, e.g., a dog as a sign of\nfidelity. While the move from these objects to images of them and\nultimately to hieroglyphics seems natural enough, Mendelssohn muses\nthat the transition from hieroglyphics to a written alphabet\n\u201crequired a leap,\u201d far beyond ordinary human powers\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 108/Gesammelte Schriften 8, p.\n174). Nonetheless, it is written language\u2019s hieroglyphic origins\nthat Mendelssohn credits with the potential for superstition,\nidolatry, and speculative excess. Because hieroglyphic signs have no\nprototype in nature, they provided potent material for superstition\nand, indeed, Mendelssohn refers to the need for written signs as\n\u201cthe first occasion [Veranlassung] for idolatry\u201d\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 113 (translation slightly\naltered)/Gesammelte Schriften 8, p. 179).\n\nIn the second chapter of Jerusalem, this general account of\nlanguage and its development figures prominently in an argument that\nJudaism is a form of supernatural legislation rather than revelation.\nBy regarding language as primarily a living dialogue between persons,\nJudaism does not lose sight of its communicative function for the sake\nof thought. As a result, theory and speculation remain tied to\nhistorical practice and concrete action. Not coincidentally, the\nlanguage of Judaism is primarily prescriptive rather than descriptive;\neven its written prescriptions are \u201clargely incomprehensible\nwithout unwritten commentaries \u2026 transmitted by oral\ninstruction.\u201d Hence, the use of language in Judaism \u2014 its\nscript and ceremonial laws \u2014 fends off the all too human\ntendency to idolize the language itself.\n\nThe appeal to tradition (oral instruction) is necessary, Mendelssohn\nadds, given the fact that, over the course of time, the laws\nthemselves become unintelligible \u201csince no words or letters\nretain their sense unchanged from one generation to the next\u201d\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 128 (translation slightly\naltered)/Gesammelte Schriften 8, p. 193). In chapter 1 of\nJerusalem he makes a similar claim after noting (a) the\nelusiveness of inner perceptions to the perceiver herself and (b) the\nimpossibility of two people using the same words to express the same\n\u201cinner perceptions\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p.\n66/Gesammelte Schriften 8, pp. 133f). Where the words in\nquestion designate inner perceptions, there is no possibility of\nostensive definition, no more when uttered today than when uttered\nages ago. Indeed, in a passage that suggests both the inscrutability\nand endless deferral of reference, Mendelssohn observes that\n\u201cwords cannot be explained [erl\u00e4utert] by\nthings. Instead, we must again have recourse to signs and\nwords and, ultimately, to metaphors\u201d (Jerusalem (1983),\np. 66/Gesammelte Schriften 8, pp. 133f). Nonetheless,\nMendelssohn is more confident about words designating objects of\nexternal perceptions and about the prospects for mutual understanding\nin regard to them. Not incidentally, ceremonial law\u2019s ritualized\ncharacter calls for a recurrent context (including specific objects\nand persons) available to external perception in the course of an\nexchange between persons (including God). Notably, \u2018you\u2019\nand \u2018we\u2019 take precedence over \u2018I\u2019 and\n\u2018it\u2019 in such contexts, as the living references of the\nformer indexicals enables one to refer effectively to oneself and to\nthings generally.\n\nThus, in Jerusalem Mendelssohn stresses the ritual and\nperformative character of language, thereby complementing his view of\nthe inextricability of language and a reason that tempers speculation\nwith common sense. The mature Mendelssohn, keenly aware of the perils\nof ostension in determining reference, tempers the claims of\nspeculation with those of common sense and is more concerned with\nbridging theory and practice in the rites of language than in the\nclaims of pure theory. Nor should it be forgotten that\nMendelssohn\u2019s recognition of language\u2019s basically\nritualistic and empathic character, as a springboard to reason, is\nrooted in what he regards as the possibilities of Judaism (for review\nof Mendelssohn\u2019s philosophy of language, including the\nsignificance of translation and language\u2019s political meaning for\nhim, see Schorch 2012).\n",
