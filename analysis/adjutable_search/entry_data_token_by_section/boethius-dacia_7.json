Yet, he\npoints out that such a cyclical view of history is unwarranted, for\nthere is at least one independent causal factor that can override the\ncelestial influence: human free will (Quaest. Ph.,\n247\u2013253). The thesis about the great year and the exact\nrepetition of history was condemned in 1277; perhaps bishop\nTempier\u2019s men found it defended by some other master, perhaps\nthey just read Boethius too superficially.\n\nAristotle in his De divinatione per somnum (\u201cOn\nProphesy in Sleep\u201d) rejects the common assumption of his\ncontemporaries that gods may send dreams that inform about future\nevents.Agreement between dream content and a later event is either (1)\ndue to the fact that the dream reflects a bodily affection of the\ndreamer\u2019s such as an incipient fever that stands in a known\ncausal relationship to a later event such as the unfolding of a\ndisease, or (2) because having had the dream makes the dreamer do what\nit suggested, or (3) mere coincidence. In De somniis\n(\u201cOn Dreams\u201d) Boethius follows Aristotle in this, and in\nso doing deviates sharply from all known near-contemporary\ncommentators on De divinatione, who\u2014encouraged\nby Averroes, among others\u2014left more room for supernatural\nintervention in dreams or, at the very least, left plenty of room for\ninformation about the future conveyed by celestial influence, a view\nfor which they believed they could find support in Aristotle\u2019s\ntext (Ebbesen, forthcoming). In his treatise Boethius mocks\n\u201cstupid people\u201d who for entirely physiological reasons\ndream of dark persons or white angels and on waking up claim they have\nseen devils or that in a rapture they have seen genuine angels. He\npiously adds that he will not deny that by divine will a devil or an\nangel may appear to someone, but this looks like a subterfuge, and was\ntaken as such by the men behind the 1277 condemnation, which features\nthe proposition \u201cThat raptures and visions do not take place\nexcept through nature\u201d.\n",
