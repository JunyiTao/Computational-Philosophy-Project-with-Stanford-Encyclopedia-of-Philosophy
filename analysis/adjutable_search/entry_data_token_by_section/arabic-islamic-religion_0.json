    "main_text": "Faith and Reason\n1. Faith and Reason\n\nA foundational question in the philosophy of religion concerns the\nrelation between faith and reason. As with perhaps all religions, the\nspectrum of Muslim responses is broad. Before looking at these\nresponses, it is important to note that \u2018reason\u2019 is used\nin two distinct senses. In one sense, reason refers to the ability,\npower or faculty by which we understand, judge and explain things.\nReason in this sense corresponds with our intellect\n(\u02bfaql). In a second sense, reason refers to the\nphilosophical and scientific explanations and theories about the\nthings that the intellect understands, judges and explains. In this\nsense, reason corresponds with science or philosophy. Analogously,\n\u2018faith\u2019 has at least two meanings. In one sense, it may\nrefer to an epistemic notion and mean to believe or to trust in\nsomething, perhaps uncritically (taql\u012bd), usually based\non the authority of some (religious) source. In a second sense, faith\nmay refer to a particular religion, understood as the body of\nknowledge encompassed in one\u2019s sacred scriptures and religious\ntraditions as in the sense of the \u2018Islamic faith\u2019. These\ndifferent senses of reason and faith in turn give rise to no less than\nthree distinct questions concerning what the relation between faith\nand reason is:\n\nWhat role, if any, does the unaided human intellect play in\nacquiring religious knowledge?\nWhat role, if any, does the intellect play in justifying specific\nbeliefs?\nHow should one reconcile conflicts between one\u2019s religious\nbelief and the finding of one\u2019s best science or philosophical\nsystem?\n\n\nAs one may expect, these questions were raised and debated in the\nIslamicate world.\n",
