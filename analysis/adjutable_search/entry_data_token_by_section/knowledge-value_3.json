    "main_text": "Understanding and Epistemic Value\n4. Understanding and Epistemic Value\n\nAs noted above, the main conclusion that Kvanvig (2003) draws from his\nreflections on the value problem is that the real focus in\nepistemology should not be on knowledge at all but on understanding,\nan epistemic standing that Kvanvig does think is especially valuable\nbut which, he argues, is distinct from knowing\u2014i.e., one can\nhave knowledge without the corresponding understanding, and one can\nhave understanding without the corresponding knowledge. (Pritchard\n[e.g., 2010a: chs 1\u20134] agrees, though his reasons for taking\nthis line are somewhat different to Kvanvig\u2019s). It is perhaps\nthis aspect of Kvanvig\u2019s book that has prompted the most\ncritical response, so it is worth briefly dwelling on his claims here\nin a little more detail.\n\nTo begin with, one needs to get clear what Kvanvig has in mind when he\ntalks of understanding, since many commentators have found the\nconception of understanding that he targets problematic. The two\nusages of the term \u2018understanding\u2019 in ordinary language\nthat Kvanvig focuses on\u2014and which he regards as being especially\nimportant to epistemology\u2014are\n\n\nwhen understanding is claimed for some object, such as some subject\nmatter, and when it involves understanding that something is the case.\n(Kvanvig 2003: 189)\n\n\nThe first kind of understanding he calls \u201cobjectual\nunderstanding\u201d, the second kind \u201cpropositional\nunderstanding\u201d. In both cases, understanding requires that one\nsuccessfully grasp how one\u2019s beliefs in the relevant\npropositions cohere with other propositions one believes (e.g.,\nKvanvig 2003: 192, 197\u20138). This requirement entails that\nunderstanding is directly factive in the case of propositional\nunderstanding and indirectly factive in the case of objectual\nunderstanding\u2014i.e., the agent needs to have at least mostly true\nbeliefs about the target subject matter in order to be truly said to\nhave objectual understanding of that subject matter.\n\nGiven that understanding\u2014propositional understanding at any\nrate\u2014is factive, Kvanvig\u2019s argument for why understanding\nis distinct from knowledge does not relate to this condition (as we\nwill see in a moment, it is standard to argue that understanding is\ndistinct from knowledge precisely because only understanding is\nnon-factive). Instead, Kvanvig notes two key differences between\nunderstanding and knowledge: that understanding, unlike knowledge,\nadmits of degrees, and that understanding, unlike knowledge, is\ncompatible with epistemic luck. Most commentators, however, have\ntended to focus not on these two theses concerning the different\nproperties of knowledge and understanding, but rather on\nKvanvig\u2019s claim that understanding is (at least indirectly)\nfactive.\n\nFor example, Elgin (2009; cf. Elgin 1996, 2004; Janvid 2014) and Riggs\n(2009) argue that it is possible for an agent to have understanding\nand yet lack true beliefs in the relevant propositions. For example,\nElgin (2009) argues that it is essential to treat scientific\nunderstanding as non-factive. She cites a number of cases in which\nscience has progressed from one theory to a better theory where, we\nwould say, understanding has increased in the process even though the\ntheories are, strictly speaking at least, false. A different\nkind of case that Elgin offers concerns scientific idealizations, such\nas the ideal gas law. Scientists know full well that no actual gas\nbehaves in this way, yet the introduction of this useful fiction\nclearly improved our understanding of the behavior of actual gasses.\nFor a defense of Kvanvig\u2019s view in the light of these charges,\nsee Kvanvig (2009a, 2009b; Carter & Gordon 2014).\n\nA very different sort of challenge to Kvanvig\u2019s treatment of\nunderstanding comes from Brogaard (2005, Other Internet Resources).\nShe argues that Kvanvig\u2019s claim that understanding is of greater\nvalue than knowledge is only achieved because he fails to give a rich\nenough account of knowledge. More specifically, Brogaard claims that\nwe can distinguish between objectual and propositional knowledge just\nas we can distinguish between objectual and propositional\nunderstanding. Propositional understanding, argues Brogaard, no more\nrequires coherence in one\u2019s beliefs than propositional\nknowledge, and so the difference in value between the two cannot lie\nhere. Moreover, while Brogaard grants that objectual understanding\ndoes incorporate a coherence requirement, this again fails to mark a\nvalue-relevant distinction between knowledge and understanding because\nthe relevant counterpart\u2014objectual knowledge (i.e., knowledge of\na subject matter)\u2014also incorporates a coherence requirement. So\nprovided that we are consistent in our comparisons of objectual and\npropositional understanding on the one hand, and objectual and\npropositional knowledge on the other, Kvanvig fails to make a sound\ncase for thinking that understanding is of greater value than\nknowledge.\n\nFinally, a further challenge to Kvanvig\u2019s treatment of knowledge\nand understanding focuses on his claims regarding epistemic luck, and\nin particular, his insistence that luck cases show how understanding\nand propositional knowledge come apart from one another. In order to\nbring the luck-based challenge into focus, we can distinguish three\nkinds of views about the relationship between understanding and\nepistemic luck that are found in the literature: strong\ncompatibilism (e.g., Kvanvig 2003; Rohwer 2014), moderate\ncompatibilism (e.g., Pritchard 2010a:\u00a0ch. 4) and\nincompatibilism (e.g., Grimm 2006; Sliwa 2015). Strong\ncompatibilism is the view that understanding is compatible with the\nvarieties of epistemic luck that are generally taken to undermine\npropositional knowledge. In particular, incompatibilists maintain that\nunderstanding is undermined by neither (i) the kind of luck that\nfeatures in traditional Gettier-style cases (1963) cases, nor with\n(ii) purely \u2018environmental luck (e.g., Pritchard 2005) of the\nsort that features in \u2018fake barn\u2019 cases (e.g., Goldman\n1979) where the fact that one\u2019s belief could easily be incorrect\nis a matter of being in an inhospitable epistemic environment.\nModerate compatibilism, by contrast, maintains that while\nunderstanding is like propositional knowledge in that it is\nincompatible with the kind of luck that features in traditional\nGettier cases, it is nonetheless compatible with environmental\nepistemic luck. Incompatibilism rejects that either kind of epistemic\nluck case demonstrates that understanding and propositional knowledge\ncome apart, and so maintains that understanding is incompatible with\nepistemic luck to the same extent that propositional knowledge is.\n",
