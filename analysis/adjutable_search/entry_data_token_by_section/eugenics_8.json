For some critics such as Kass (2003)\nand Sandel (2007), the human disposition of hubris or mastery that the\nproject of genetic engineering expresses and promotes, undermines a\ncentral aspect of humanity: our appreciation of the gifted character of\nhuman life, the sense that the way we are is not solely the product of\nour own doing. Similarly, Habermas (2003) contends that in transforming\nreproduction from a natural process of creation to one of manufacture,\ngenetic engineering practices will fundamentally alter relationships in\nthe moral community as well as human freedom and autonomy.\n\n\nConcern with the effects of reprogenetics on human\nnature are also present in proponents of liberal eugenics. For\ninstance, Glover proposes two potential features of great value in our\ncurrent nature: our capacity to rein in our violent and destructive\ntendencies, and our capacity to aim for a good life (for Glover, this\nis about a balance between happiness and flourishing). These are very\ntentatively offered, with many qualifications about possible linkages\nto other traits of value, and the likelihood that we might be more\nsuccessful in securing containment through non-genetic means. Still,\nthe suggestion is that if parents might be tempted to select for\ngenetic markers linked to, for instance, extreme selfishness or\nemotional coldness, in an attempt to have their child succeed in\ngaining power and riches, doing so would seem to endanger parts of our\nnature that we can widely agree are deeply valuable for society as a\nwhole.\n\n\nMost advocates of liberal eugenics, however,\ndismiss worries about effects on human nature. They contend that we\nhave likely unjustifiable intuitions that our present nature is worth\npreserving (Buchanan 2011) or they argue that a main trait of human\nnature is its changeability (Harris 2007). Other advocates claim that\nwe have a tendency to overvalue the \u201cstatus quo\u201d and this\nleads us to see some core values, e.g. openness to the unbidden,\ncurrent longevity parameters, etc., as optimal when in fact we are\nsimply affected by status quo bias (Green 2007; Bostrom and Ord\n2006).\n\n\nSome critics (Sparrow 2012) have argued that\nadvocates of liberal eugenics face a problem if they reject the idea\nthat some conception of human nature or of normal human capacities\nmatters for debates about genetic improvement. They must accept that\nparents\u2019 have reasons to choose some traits in spite of repugnant\nconsequences, or that parents\u2019 choices regarding some human\ntraits must take into account the interests of society. Others contend\nthat proponents of liberal eugenics simply fail to appreciate the\nhistoricity of the human condition and view human beings as a\ncollection of parameters that can be optimized in isolation of each\nother (Nordmann 2007).\n\n\nStill other critics (Sandel 2007; Kass 2003)\nhighlight the ways in which the motivations for the genetic improvement\nof our offspring express hubris, a \u201cdrive to mastery\u201d\n(Sandel 2007: 27) that, left unchecked, threatens not just human\nnature, but the meaning of parent-child relationships, from openness to\nthe \u201cunbidden\u201d and unconditional love to design and\nmanufacture (Kass 2003); from loving whatever child comes along, to\nloving a particular child because of chosen traits (Herissone-Kelly\n2007).\n\n\nSandel recognizes that many parents already exert\nexcessive influence on their children\u2019s lives, and may fail to love\nthem unconditionally, but he worries that genetic technologies will\nonly exasperate that tendency. Even though we might undertake genetic\npractices for the benefit of our offspring, in so doing, we make them\ninto creatures who must be indebted to us for their gifts, and for whom\nour love may be conditional on fulfilling our desires. If a parent\ndesigns a child to be a certain way, her investment will increase the\nparent\u2019s demands. In a similar vein, Kass (2003) notes that\nparental hopes will become parental expectations if we allow the\ndesigning of children. The concern about parental expectations and how\nchoice might affect the unconditional love we envision for parents is\nalso explored by disability scholars (Kittay and Kittay 2000; Asch and\nWasserman 2005).\n\n\nProponents of liberal eugenics respond that much\nof what we attempt to do in medicine to create treatments for disease\ncould itself fit under a \u201cdrive to mastery\u201d and might\nlikewise question our commitment to being \u201copen to the\nunbidden\u201d (see Buchanan 2011). Also, if the point is simply that\nwe must be attentive to our inclinations to hubris \u2013 we might get\ncarried away in thinking we can enhance appropriately \u2013 then we\ncould heed that warning without rejecting the use of genetic\ntechnologies to improve our offspring entirely. Other advocates simply\ndeny the value of humility (Glover 2006: 113).\n\n\nKamm (2005) dismisses Sandel\u2019s worries about\nmastery and openness to the unbidden but raises a different kind of\nworry about the enhancement project, one related to concerns regarding\naggregate effects of individual choice. Her fear is that we may lack\nimagination to see how a variety of traits (and different combinations\nof traits) can create goods we have yet to envision or experience.\nParents who might wish to design their child to have the good trait of\ncomposing classical music, for instance, would have been unable to\nconceive that it would be good to have a child who turns out to be one\nof the Beatles, at to have conceived it, would have involved creating\nthe style before the Beatles did.\n\n\nAnother worry linked to the desire for control\ncomes from Habermas (2003) who grounds his arguments in a deontological\nframework. He argues that by engineering our children in very specific\nways \u2013 beyond the treatment of disease \u2013 we may undermine their\ncapacity for self-definition, their sense of being responsible for\nthemselves (in respect to creating their own identities), and their\nfreedom (2003: 12\u201313). He claims that it is not genetic\nengineering per se that is the problem, but rather\nthe scope of its use as well as the attitude. In this case, the\nwrong attitude is one that is not attentive to likely second person\nconsent to the changes \u2013 would the child have granted approval for\nthe selected traits? For Habermas, what matters is the attitude of\nappreciating the need for the future person\u2019s presumed consent, rather\nthan the idea of making the change merely according to parental\npreferences.\n\n\nFurther, he worries that parents who engineer\ntheir children will have expectations of their children \u201cwithout,\nhowever, providing the addressee [the child] with an opportunity to\ntake a revisionist stand\u201d (2003: 51). Why not?\nThe genetic program is a mute, and in a sense, unanswerable fact. This\nis so because, unlike persons born naturally, someone who is at odds\nwith genetically fixed intentions is barred from developing, in the\ncourse of a reflectively appropriated and deliberately continued life\nhistory, an attitude toward her talents (and handicaps) which implies a\nrevised self-understanding and allows for\na productive response to the initial situation\n(Habermas 2003: 62).\n\n\nThe basis for this claim seems to rest on a\ndistinction between \u201cthe grown and the made\u201d (Habermas,\n2003: 52). Being created to be a particular way is\nbeing made, and so objectified, a product of the parents.\nBeing grown, by contrast, recognizes the individual subjectivity of the\nnew person, who is equal to her parents and not defined by them. This\nobjection shares much with Kass\u2019s (2003) concerns about genetic\ndespotism \u2013 control of one generation by the previous one.\n\n\nMany liberal eugenics advocates (Glover 2006;\nGreen 2007; Buchanan 2011) are also dismissive of these concerns. For\nthem, it is unclear how genetic selection or editing is different from\nother activities that presumably are also intended by parents to\n\u201cmake\u201d their children, such as registering them in school,\nsports practice, or piano lessons with the aim of having children who\nare likely to became academics, athletes, or musicians. Moreover,\nliberal eugenics proponents contend that it is not clear either why the\ngenetically designed child could not be revisionist\nin her response to her parents. Designing a child to have features that\nmake, for example, an athletic career possible (even likely) is not the\nsame as ensuring such a career, or even an athletic body. Parenting\nwould not lose its challenges simply because of the origins of the\nfeatures of the child in question.\n\n\nHowever, critics contend that advocates of liberal\neugenics assume that there are no morally relevant differences in the\nmeans parents take to try to shape their children. Such assumption\nseems questionable. For instance, the longer iterative process of\neducating a child enforces a kind of communicative engagement in ways\nthat cannot be part of engineering an embryo (Malmqvist 2011). Indeed,\narguably it is not just the means that are different (de\nMelo-Mart\u00edn 2018). The goals of engineering an embryo\n\u2013through selection or editing \u2013 and the goals of educating a\nchild \u2013in various ways \u2013 are similar only in appearance.\nWhile genetic selection or editing focuses on a particular trait, the\nemphasis of education or training is the whole person, with attention\nto the particular child\u2019s personality, even if the aspect of\ninterest \u2013e.g., music or sport excellence \u2013 are the\ncharacteristic that parents aim to inculcate in their children.\n \n",
