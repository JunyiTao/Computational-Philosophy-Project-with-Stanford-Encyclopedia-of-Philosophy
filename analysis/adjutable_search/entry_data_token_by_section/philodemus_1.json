    "main_text": "Life || Italy\n1.3 Italy\n\n\nIn any event, Philodemus\u2019 arrival in Italy may not be placed\nlong after 70. For in the historical record, Philodemus is known to us\nprimarily as the Greek philosopher and poet associated with the Roman\nsenator L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (ca. 101\u2013post 43, cos. 58) by\nCicero (In Pisonem 68\u201372, 74; the name is supplied by the commentator Asconius ad 68: \u2018He means Philodemus, who was at that time a most excellent Epicurean and whose poems are lubricious\u2019; cf.\nSider 1997: T2, 228\u201330). Here, Cicero speaks of Philodemus, without\nnaming him, as Piso\u2019s constant companion since the Roman, as a\nyoung man, sought his company, having heard this Epicurean advocate\npleasure as the goal of life. Cicero notes that Philodemus was a\ngentleman when not in Piso\u2019s company and that he cultivated arts\nfor which Epicureans were not generally known, writing extremely\nelegant and witty poetry, and indicates (In Pis. 70) that\nPhilodemus, eager to please, could not turn a deaf ear to Piso, a Roman\nsenator, despite the latter\u2019s tendency to ignore the fine\ndistinctions with which the doctrine of pleasure was hedged about. If\nthe accuracy of this polemical account may be relied upon, this would\nmean that Piso, who was born around 101 BCE, would have been at least\n30\u2014the minimum age for entry into the Senate\u2014at the time of\ntheir meeting, though Cicero terms him \u2018young man\u2019\n(adulescens).\n\n\nBy 55 BCE, when Cicero attacked Piso, Philodemus could be firmly\nassociated with him. Philodemus addressed his book On the Good King\naccording to Homer, to a young relation of Piso\u2019s. He also\naddressed the fourth book of his Rhetoric to C. Vibius Pansa\nCaetronianus, who died fighting Antony at Forum Gallorum in April of\n43. One reference to a Roman event, Antony\u2019s supplying of dwarfs\nfrom Syria for gladiatorial games (De Signis col. ii.18),\nperhaps implies a terminus post quem of 40 (Last 1922, 177\u201380;\ncontra, Sider 1997, 11). If he was born around 110, Philodemus\ncould have lived into the later 30s.\n",
