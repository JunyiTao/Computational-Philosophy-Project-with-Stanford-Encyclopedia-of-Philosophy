A stipulative definition of a term may, as\nit happens, be extensionally adequate to the antecedent uses of the\nterm. A dictionary may offer ostensive definitions of some words\n(e.g., of color words). An ostensive definition can also be\nexplicative. For example, one can offer an improvement of a\npreexisting concept \u201cone foot\u201d thus: \u201clet one foot\nbe the present length of that rod.\u201d In its preexisting use, the\nconcept \u201cone foot\u201d may be quite vague; the ostensively\nintroduced explication may, in contrast, be relatively precise.\nMoreover, as we shall see below, there are other kinds of definition\nthan those considered so far.\n",
