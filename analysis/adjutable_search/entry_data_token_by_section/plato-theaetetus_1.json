    "main_text": "Summary of the Dialogue\n2. Summary of the Dialogue\n\n\nAt the gates of the city of Megara in 369 BC, Eucleides and Terpsion\nhear a slave read out Eucleides\u2019 memoir of a philosophical discussion\nthat took place in 399 BC, shortly before Socrates\u2019 trial and\nexecution (142a\u2013143c). In this, the young Theaetetus is introduced to\nSocrates by his mathematics tutor, Theodorus. Socrates questions\nTheaetetus about the nature of expertise, and this leads him to pose\nthe key question of the dialogue: \u201cWhat is knowledge?\u201d\n(143d\u2013145e). Theaetetus\u2019 first response (D0) is to\ngive examples of knowledge such as geometry, astronomy, harmony,\narithmetic (146a\u2013c). Socrates objects that, for any x,\nexamples of x are neither necessary nor sufficient for a\ndefinition of x (146d\u2013147e). Theaetetus admits this, and\ncontrasts the ease with which he and his classmates define\nmathematical terms with his inability to define knowledge\n(147c\u2013148e). Socrates offers to explain Theaetetus\u2019 bewilderment about\nthe question \u201cWhat is knowledge?\u201d by comparing himself\nwith a midwife: Theaetetus, he suggests, is in discomfort because he\nis in intellectual labour (148e\u2013151d).\n\n\nThus prompted, Theaetetus states his first acceptable definition,\nwhich is the proposal (D1) that \u201cKnowledge is\nperception\u201d (151d\u2013e). Socrates does not respond to this\ndirectly. Instead he claims that D1 entails two other\ntheories (Protagoras\u2019 and Heracleitus\u2019), which he expounds (151e\u2013160e)\nand then criticises (160e\u2013183c). Socrates eventually presents no fewer\nthan eleven arguments, not all of which seem seriously intended,\nagainst the Protagorean and Heracleitean views. If any of these\narguments hit its target, then by modus tollens\nD1 is also false. A more direct argument against\nD1 is eventually given at 184\u20137.\n\n\nIn 187b4\u20138, Theaetetus proposes a second definition of knowledge:\n(D2) \u201cKnowledge is true belief.\u201d\nD2 provokes Socrates to ask: how can there be any\nsuch thing as false belief? There follows a five-phase\ndiscussion which attempts to come up with an account of false\nbelief. All five of these attempts fail, and that appears to be the\nend of the topic of false belief. Finally, at 200d\u2013201c, Socrates\nreturns to D2 itself. He dismisses\nD2 just by arguing that accidental true beliefs\ncannot be called knowledge, giving Athenian jurymen as an\nexample of accidental true belief.\n\n\nTheaetetus tries a third time. His final proposal\n(D3) defines knowledge as \u201ctrue belief\nwith an account (logos)\u201d (201c\u2013d). The ensuing\ndiscussion attempts to spell out what it might be like for\nD3 to be true, then makes three attempts to spell out\nwhat a logos is.\n\n\nIn 201d\u2013202d, the famous passage known as The Dream of\nSocrates, a two-part ontology of elements and complexes is\nproposed. Parallel to this ontology runs a theory of explanation that\nclaims that to explain, to offer a logos, is to analyse\ncomplexes into their elements, i.e., those parts which cannot be\nfurther analysed. Crucially, the Dream Theory says that knowledge of\nO is true belief about O plus an account of\nO\u2019s composition. If O is not composite, O\ncannot be known, but only \u201cperceived\u201d (202b6). When\nSocrates argues against the Dream Theory (202d8\u2013206b11), it is this\nentailment that he focuses on.\n\n\nSocrates then turns to consider, and reject, three attempts to spell\nout what a logos is\u2014to give an account of\n\u201caccount.\u201d  The first attempt takes logos just to\nmean \u201cspeech\u201d or \u201cstatement\u201d (206c\u2013e). The\nsecond account (206e4\u2013208b12) of \u201clogos of\nO\u201d takes it as \u201cenumeration of the elements of\nO.\u201d The third and last proposal (208c1\u2013210a9) is that\nto give the logos of O is to cite the\ns\u00eameion or diaphora of O, the\n\u201csign\u201d or diagnostic feature wherein O differs\nfrom everything else.\n\n\nAll three attempts to give an account of \u201caccount\u201d\nfail. The day\u2019s discussion, and the dialogue, end in aporia.\nSocrates leaves to face his enemies in the courtroom.\n",
