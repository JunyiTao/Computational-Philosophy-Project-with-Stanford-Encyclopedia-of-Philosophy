    "main_text": "Assessment of the Current Standing of The Turing Test || Logically Sufficient Conditions\n4.2 Logically Sufficient Conditions\n\nThere are many philosophers who have supposed that The Turing Test is\nintended to provide logically sufficient conditions for the\nattribution of intelligence. That is, there are many philosophers who\nhave supposed that The Turing Test claims that it is logically\nimpossible for something that lacks intelligence to pass The Turing\nTest. (Often, this supposition goes with an interpretation according\nto which passing The Turing Test requires rather a lot, e.g.,\nproducing behavior that is indistinguishable from human behavior over\nan entire lifetime.)\n\nThere are well-known arguments against the claim that passing The\nTuring Test\u2014or any other purely behavioral test\u2014provides\nlogically sufficient conditions for the attribution of intelligence.\nThe standard objection to this kind of analysis of\nintelligence (mind, thought) is that a being whose behavior was\nproduced by \u201cbrute force\u201d methods ought not to count as\nintelligent (as possessing a mind, as having thoughts).\n\nConsider, for example, Ned Block\u2019s Blockhead. Blockhead\nis a creature that looks just like a human being, but that is\ncontrolled by a \u201cgame-of-life look-up tree,\u201d i.e. by a\ntree that contains a programmed response for every discriminable input\nat each stage in the creature\u2019s life. If we agree that Blockhead\nis logically possible, and if we agree that Blockhead is not\nintelligent (does not have a mind, does not think), then Blockhead is\na counterexample to the claim that the Turing Test provides a\nlogically sufficient condition for the ascription of intelligence.\nAfter all, Blockhead could be programmed with a look-up tree that\nproduces responses identical with the ones that you would\ngive over the entire course of your life (given the same\ninputs).\n\nThere are perhaps only two ways in which someone who claims that The\nTuring Test offers logically sufficient conditions for the attribution\nof intelligence can respond to Block\u2019s argument. First, it could\nbe denied that Blockhead is a logical possibility; second, it could be\nclaimed that Blockhead would be intelligent (have a mind, think).\n\nIn order to deny that Blockhead is a logical possibility, it seems\nthat what needs to be denied is the commonly accepted link between\nconceivability and logical possibility: it certainly seems that\nBlockhead is conceivable, and so, if (properly circumscribed)\nconceivability is sufficient for logical possibility, then it seems\nthat we have good reason to accept that Blockhead is a logical\npossibility. Since it would take us too far away from our present\nconcerns to explore this issue properly, we merely note that it\nremains a controversial question whether (properly circumscribed)\nconceivability is sufficient for logical possibility. (For further\ndiscussion of this issue, see Crooke (2002).)\n\nThe question of whether Blockhead is intelligent (has a mind, thinks)\nmay seem straightforward, but\u2014despite Block\u2019s confident\nassertion that Blockhead \u201chas all of the intelligence of a\ntoaster\u201d\u2014it is not obvious that we should deny that\nBlockhead is intelligent. Blockhead may not be a particularly\nefficient processor of information; but it is at least a processor of\ninformation, and that\u2014in combination with the behavior that is\nproduced as a result of the processing of information\u2014might well\nbe taken to be sufficient grounds for the attribution of some\nlevel of intelligence to Blockhead. For further critical discussion of\nthe argument of Block (1981), see McDermott (2014), and Pautz and\nStoljar (2019).\n",
