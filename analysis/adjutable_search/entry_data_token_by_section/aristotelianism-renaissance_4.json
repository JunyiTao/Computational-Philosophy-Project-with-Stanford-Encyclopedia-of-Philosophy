Some Remarks on the History of the Habit of Sorting Renaissance Philosophy into Schools\n\n\nThe ancient habit of sorting philosophers into schools or groups seems\nfirst to have been applied to Aristotelian philosophers by Francisco\n Patrizi [Franciscus Patritius][27]\n in his Discussiones peripatetic\u00e6. It is an approach,\nthat is useful to give order to a text that treats a great number of\nRenaissance\n Aristotelians.[28]  \n But in a text not trying to give at least superficial doxographical\ninformation concerning the single philosophers and their works, it\nmight (correctly) be interpreted as a pretext not to study these\nphilosophers and their\n works.[29] \n And the charming character of Renaissance \u201cAristotelian\u201d texts\nis more situated in their (considerable) diversities than in their\n(limited) similarities.\n",
