    "main_text": "Early Nineteenth-Century Transformism || Transformism in Britain 1830\u20131859\n5. Summary and Conclusion\n\nThe long historical scenario summarized in the present entry has\nsought to display the complexity of transformism in biology in the\nperiod as it developed independently of the advent of Darwinism. This\nhistory reveals several lines of non-Darwinian transformism that were\ncurrent and under discussion in the natural historical sciences which\nwere converging on larger explanatory theories of the history of life.\nIt also lends plausibility to the claim of historian Peter Bowler that\nwithout Darwin, life and earth science would still likely have come to\na \u201cscience that we could still recognize, although its\ncomponents would seem to have different implications, thanks to having\nbeen assembled in a more natural sequence of discovery\u201d (Bowler,\n2013, p. 279). It was against this complex background that Darwin\nwould develop his own theory on the origin and diversification of\nforms with emphasis on the principle of natural selection. He would,\nhowever, draw in many ways on these pre-existing discussions in\nFrench, British and even German sources, and reinterpret these issues\nagainst the framework of criticisms that had emerged against\ntransformism. Further exploration of this will be made in the entry\nDarwin: From the Origin of Species to the Descent of\nMan.\n",
