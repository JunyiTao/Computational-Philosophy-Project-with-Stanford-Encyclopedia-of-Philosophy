    "main_text": "Alexander as philosopher\n3. Alexander as philosopher\n\nAs a philosopher, Alexander presents in his writings an Aristotelian\npoint of view that reflects in many ways the conditions of his own\ntime, on questions that were not or not extensively discussed by\nAristotle himself. His Problems and Solutions\n(Quaestiones), in three books, are collections of short\nessays, which were apparently grouped together in different books\nalready in antiquity. As their Greek title (phusikai scholikai\naporiai kai luseis. lit. \u2018School-discussion of problems and\nsolutions on nature\u2019, cf. Sharples 1992, 3) indicates, these\nthree books address problems in natural philosophy in the broadest\nsense. The fourth collection, Problems of Ethics\n(\u00eathika probl\u00eamata) proceeds in a similar way. As\nthe lists of the essays\u2019 titles at the beginning of each book\nshow, the collections contain a hodgepodge of topics, arranged in a\nquite loose order. The intellectual level of these discussions is\nuneven and the titles of the treatises are sometimes misleading. Some\nof essays do present problems and solutions, but others contain\nexegeses of problematic passages in Aristotle\u2019s texts. There are also\nmere paraphrases or summaries of certain texts, collections of\narguments for a certain position, and sketches of larger projects that\nwere never worked out. It is unclear when and by whom these\ncollections were put together. As mentioned above, some of the essays\nmay be the work of Alexander\u2019s associates, or lecture-notes taken by\nhis students. Most interesting from our point of view are those\nquestions that deal with metaphysical issues, like the relation of\nform and matter, and with the status of universals in general (see\nTweedale 1984, Sharples 2005, and Sirkel 2011). Of particular interest\nare also those discussions in book II that are concerned with certain\naspects of Aristotle\u2019s psychology, because Alexander\u2019s commentary on\nthe De anima is lost; they supplement his treatise On the\nSoul. Of special interest here is his work that has been dubbed\n\u2018De anima libri Mantissa\u2019 (=\n\u2018makeweight\u2019 for his book On the Soul) by its\nfirst modern editor, I. Bruns. Of interest are also the essays on the\nnotion of providence (an important topic at Alexander\u2019s time, in part\ndue to the influence of the Stoics\u2019 focus on divine providence).\nThese essays defend the view that while there is no special care for\nindividuals, providence over the objects in the sublunary sphere is\nexercised by the movement of the heavenly bodies in the sense that\nthey preserve the continuity of the species on earth.\n\nSince Alexander did not write a commentary on Aristotle\u2019s ethics, his\nEthical Problems, despite their somewhat disorganized state,\nare of considerable interest (cf. Madigan 1987; Sharples 1990; 2001,\n2). For, apart from Aspasius\u2019 early commentary on parts of the\nNicomachean Ethics there are no extant commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s ethics before the composite commentary by various hands of\nthe Byzantine age (Michael of Ephesus in the 11th/12th c. and his\ncontemporary Eustratius, together with some material extracted from\nearlier authors, cf. Sharples 1990, 6\u20137, 95). This gap may\nsuggest that ethics had become a marginal subject in later antiquity.\nAlexander\u2019s Ethical Problems are therefore the only link\nbetween Aspasius and the medieval commentaries. Though Alexander\u2019s\ncollection of essays displays no recognizable order, it is worth\nstudying because many of the \u2018questions\u2019 address central\nissues in Aristotle\u2019s ethics. Some, for instance, are concerned with\nthe notion of pleasure as a good and pain as an evil; with pleasure as\na supplement of activity supporting its connection with happiness;\nwith the relation between virtues and vices; with virtue as a mean;\nand with the concept of the involuntary and the conditions of\nresponsibility. Alexander\u2019s discussions confirm not only his thorough\nfamiliarity with Aristotle\u2019s ethics, but also reflect the debates of\nthe Peripatetics with the Epicureans and Stoics in Hellenistic times,\nas shown especially by the terminology he uses. The Hellenistic\nbackground also explains the fact that Alexander pays special\nattention to logical and physical distinctions in connection with\nethical problems.\n\nThe best example of his procedure is Alexander\u2019s construal of an\nAristotelian conception of fate in the treatise On Fate.\nThough its long, and at times inelegant, passages do not make for easy\nreading, this is no doubt the essay that is most interesting for a\ngeneral public (cf. Sharples 1983 and 2001, 1). Not only is it the\nmost comprehensive surviving document in the centuries-long debate on\nfate, determinism, and free will that was carried on between the\nStoics, the Epicureans and the Academic Skeptics, it also contains\nsome original suggestions and points of criticism, as a comparison\nwith Cicero\u2019s On Fate would show. It is unclear whether there\nhad been a genuinely Peripatetic contribution to this debate before\nAlexander. If there was not, Alexander clearly filled a significant\ngap. Though Aristotle himself in a way touches on all important\naspects of the problem of determinism \u2014 logical, physical, and\nethical \u2014 in different works, he was not greatly concerned with\nthis issue, nor does he entertain the notion of fate\n(heimarmen\u00ea) as a rational cosmic ordering-force, as\nthe Stoics were going to introduce. In De interpretatione 9,\nhe famously proposed to solve the problem of \u2018future\ntruth\u2019 by suspending truth-values for statements in the future\ntense concerning individual contingent events. In his ethics he deals\nwith the question of whether individuals have free choice, once their\ncharacter is settled. As Aristotle sees it, there is little or no\nleeway, but he holds individuals responsible for their actions because\nthey collaborated in the acquisition of their character (EN\nIII, 1\u20135). In his physical works Aristotle limits strict\nnecessity to the motions of the stars, while allowing for a wide range\nof events in the sublunary realm that do not happen of necessity but\nonly for the most part or by chance (Phys. II, 4\u20136).\nThough he subscribes to the principle that the same causal\nconstellations have the same effects, he also allows for \u2018fresh\nstarts\u2019 in a causal series (Metaph. E 3). Given these\nvarious limitations, Aristotle had no reason to treat determinism as a\ncentral philosophical problem either in his ethics or in his physics.\nThe situation changed, however, once the Stoics had established a\nrigorously physicalist system ruled by an all-pervasive divine mind.\nIt is this radicalization of the determinist position that sharpened\nthe general consciousness of the problematic, as witnessed by the\nrelentless attacks on the Stoics by their opponents, most of all by\nthe Academic skeptics and the Epicureans, which lasted for\ncenturies.\n\nThis long-standing debate prompted Alexander to develop an\nAristotelian concept of fate by identifying it with the natural\nconstitution of things, including human nature (On Fate, ch.\n2\u20136). Since there is always the possibility that something\nhappens against the natural and normal order of things, there are\nexceptions to what is \u2018fated\u2019 and there is room for chance\nand the fortuitous. Most of the treatise is occupied not with the\ndefense of this Peripatetic position, but rather with attacks on the\nvarious aspects of the determinist position. Alexander claims to show\nwhy the Stoics\u2019 attempt (though he nowhere names them) to defend\na compabilitist position must fail. The determinists, he says, are\nneither entitled to maintain a coherent concept of luck and the\nfortuitous, nor of contingency and possibility, nor of deliberation\nand potency. The bulk of this polemical discussion concentrates on the\ndifficulties for the Stoic position by claiming that their concept of\nfate makes human deliberation superfluous and therefore imports\ndisastrous consequences for human morality and life in general (chs.\n7\u201321). Alexander also presents, albeit in a dialectical fashion\nintended to lead to the defeat of the Stoic tenets, the arguments used\nby the Stoics in their defense of contingency, chance, and human\nresponsibility. As he claims time and again, the Stoics can defend the\nuse of these terms at best in a verbal sense. In addition, their\nnotion of divine foreknowledge and prophecy turns out to be incoherent\n(chs. 22\u201335). The stringency and originality of Alexander\u2019s\ncritique cannot be discussed here (cf. Sharples 1983; Bobzien 1998).\nWhile his presentation is not free from repetition and while the order\nof the arguments leaves something to be desired, it is an interesting\ntext that displays a lively engagement with the issues and quite some\nphilosophical sophistication. He argues that truly free action\nrequires that at the time one acts, it is open to one both to do and\nnot to do what one does in fact then do. Thus Alexander originates the\nposition later known as \u2018libertarianism\u2019 in the theory of\nfree action. Alexander\u2019s construction of an Aristotelian account of\nfate and divine providence that limits them to nature and its overall\nbenign order clearly argues for a weak conception of fate; but it is\nthe only one that Alexander regards as compatible with the principles\nof Aristotelian philosophy of nature and ethics. That the concept of\nfate greatly intrigued him is confirmed by the fact that he returns to\nthe issue in his addendum (\u2018Mantissa\u2019) to the treatise\nOn the Soul and in some of his Problems (2.4.5, cf.\nSharples 1983, esp. the Introduction).\n\nThe attempt to \u2018naturalize\u2019 crucial concepts in\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy is typical of Alexander\u2019s philosophical stance\nin general. He regards universals as inseparable from particulars and\nas secondary to them, and stresses the unity of matter and form.\nSimilarly, he treats the human soul as the perishable form imposed\nupon the bodily elements to constitute a living human being. He argues\nthat the intellect develops from an embodied intellect (that is\nfocused upon the material world) to a state that eventually contains\nforms that are not embodied. He rules out personal immortality by\nidentifying the active intellect with pure form and with God, the\nUnmoved Mover (see On the Soul and Caston 2012). In his\nemphasis on a naturalist point of view he appears remarkably free from\nthe increasingly spiritualistic and mystical tendencies of his own\ntime. In the treatise On Mixture and Increase Alexander\nexpands on problems that Aristotle touched upon only briefly in On\nGeneration and Corruption I 10, but his main concern is \u2014\nas it is in his On Fate \u2014 to prove that the Stoic\nposition of a \u2018thorough\u2019 mixture of two substances cannot\nbe maintained. These treatises suggest that at the beginning of the\nthird century philosophical discussions between the traditional\nschools were still lively. We have, of course, no other evidence on\nthat issue. But there would be little point in proving the superiority\nof the Peripatetic doctrine, as he does in On Fate, to the\nemperors if the issue was by general consent regarded as obsolescent.\nIt is unlikely, therefore, that Alexander\u2019s polemics are only a kind\nof shadow-boxing against long-gone adversaries.\n\n",
