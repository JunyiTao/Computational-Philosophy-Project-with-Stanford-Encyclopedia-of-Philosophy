    "main_text": "Perceptual theories || The problem of pain location\n3.3 The problem of pain location\n\nThe perceptualist identification of pains with experiences is not in\nthe clear yet: the perceptual theorist has to give an account of the\ncommon practice of attributing pains to bodily locations. For if pains\nare perceptual experiences they can\u2019t be intelligibly (let alone\ncorrectly) located in body parts (except perhaps in the head).\n\nThe most common perceptualist treatment of this problem concedes that\nthere is no way to analyze sentences attributing pain to body parts,\nlike (1)\u2013(6), which would do complete justice to all aspects of\nour common-sense conception of pain. Nevertheless, the resulting\naccount, it is claimed, comes pretty close. According to the basic\nproposal, when I utter a sentence like\n\n\n(5) I feel a sharp pain in the back of my right hand,\n\n\nI primarily self-attribute a certain kind of experience which has an\nintentional content (Armstrong 1962, 1968, pp. 314\u2013316; and\nPitcher 1970, pp. 383\u2013385, 1971 \u2014 see also Dretske 1999,\n2006; Tye 1997, 2006a). To say that an experience has an intentional\ncontent is to say that it represents a certain situation or state of\naffairs (which may be quite complex), or to say that it has an\nintentional content with a non-indicative function like issuing a\ncommand (imperative content \u2014 see below). So for instance, when\nI see a red apple on the table, I am having a visual experience which\nrepresents, among other things, a red apple on the table. Some\nperceptualists might describe the proper intentional or\nrepresentational content of experiences in less objectual terms by not\nnaming what is represented in terms of ordinary objects like apples\nand tables. For these theorists, it is more appropriate to\ncharacterize the representational content of perceptual experiences in\nterms of the ways in which the sensible qualities of those objects are\ninstantiated or distributed in one\u2019s perceptual field.\nExperiences detect or track these qualities. For instance, they may\nsay that my visual experience represents the instantiation of redness\nwith the instantiation of a certain (apple-like) shape quality, etc.\nBut both ways of characterizing this content are meant to be objective\nin the sense that they represent extramental reality (at least, partly\n\u2014 it all depends on how one conceives of so-called secondary\nqualities). Treating perceptual experiences as having intentional\ncontent is appropriate and in line with the naturalistic motivation\nbehind developing perceptual accounts in general, for this is how they\nserve their primary function of informing their owners about their\nimmediate extramental environment, including bodily environment.\n\nSo the proposal is that, just like other perceptual experiences, pain\nexperiences also represent. They represent tissue damage as occurring\nin a certain region of one\u2019s body. The location of pain, then,\nis the location of tissue damage as represented by pain experiences.\nThe location is an intentional location. So (5) should be analyzed as\nself-attributing an experience which represents a certain kind of\ntissue damage occurring in the back of my hand. In other words, even\nthough the surface structure of sentences (5) suggests that there is\nan attribution of pain to a bodily location (more strictly, that I\nstand in the feeling relation to a pain which is located in a part of\nmy body), the proposed analysis says that this is not what is\ngoing on. What I do when I utter (5) is an attribution of a different\nsort: I attribute to myself a feeling state (an\nexperience) which has an intentional content to the effect that a\ncertain region of my body is in a physical condition of a certain\nsort.\n\nOn this view, there is thus a confusion in common-sense ways of\ntalking, due to the fact that the pain is not in my hand; the pain,\nbeing a state of feeling or experience, is \u201cin my mind.\u201d\nIt is the physical disturbance that is in my hand which my feeling\nstate represents (in a confused and indistinct way, as Descartes would\nput it). Upon reflection, however, we may realize that in uttering (5)\nI actually attribute an intentional feeling state to\nmyself which in turn attributes a physical disturbance to my\nhand. The colloquial ways of speaking just jumble the pain with the\ndisturbance, and thus confuse and mislead us. Pains, on this view, are\nexperiences, not objects of our experiences. Moreover, since these\nexperiences have representational content, they have accuracy\nconditions: they can be correct or incorrect; they can veridically\nrepresent or misrepresent. But even when they misrepresent, these\nexperiences are pain experiences. So I can be in genuine pain, even\nthough there is nothing physically wrong with my hand.\n\nNote that according to this analysis, there are, in a sense, two kinds\nof property attribution going on: an attribution of an experience and\nan attribution of tissue damage to a body part. But in uttering (5)\nI do only the former attribution, not the latter. The latter\nattribution is done not by me but by my experience, so to speak, by\nrepresenting it as happening in my hand. This is why I am not\nlogically committed to finding tissue damage in my hand in\ntruly uttering (5) \u2014 even though this is what I normally\nexpect to find there. Indeed, as observed in the first\nsection, if it turns out that there is nothing physically wrong with\nmy hand, I am not wrong. (5) is still true. But my experience\nis now wrong: it misrepresents the back of my hand as having something\nphysically wrong with it, as if some tissue damage were occurring\nthere. I am having an illusion about my hand but I am still in genuine\npain. Illusory or hallucinatory pain experiences are still genuine\npains.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s and Pitcher\u2019s perceptual accounts of pain\nlocation have been very influential. Treating pain location as the\nintentional location of tissue damage as represented in the pain\nexperience, in one form or another, seems to dominate the thinking in\nthis area. Nevertheless, there is a sizable philosophical literature\non the problem of pain location or the spatiality of pain in\n general.[11\n\n",
