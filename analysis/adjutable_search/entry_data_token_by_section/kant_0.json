    "main_text": "Life and works\n1. Life and works\n\nImmanuel Kant was born April 22, 1724 in K\u00f6nigsberg, near the\nsoutheastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Today K\u00f6nigsberg has been\nrenamed Kaliningrad and is part of Russia. But during Kant\u2019s\nlifetime K\u00f6nigsberg was the capital of East Prussia, and its\ndominant language was German. Though geographically remote from the\nrest of Prussia and other German cities, K\u00f6nigsberg was then a\nmajor commercial center, an important military port, and a relatively\ncosmopolitan university\n town.[1]\n\nKant was born into an artisan family of modest means. His father was a\nmaster harness maker, and his mother was the daughter of a harness\nmaker, though she was better educated than most women of her social\nclass. Kant\u2019s family was never destitute, but his father\u2019s\ntrade was in decline during Kant\u2019s youth and his parents at\ntimes had to rely on extended family for financial support. \n\nKant\u2019s parents were Pietist and he attended a Pietist school,\nthe Collegium Fridericianum, from ages eight through fifteen. Pietism\nwas an evangelical Lutheran movement that emphasized conversion,\nreliance on divine grace, the experience of religious emotions, and\npersonal devotion involving regular Bible study, prayer, and\nintrospection. Kant reacted strongly against the forced soul-searching\nto which he was subjected at the Collegium Fridericianum, in response\nto which he sought refuge in the Latin classics, which were central to\nthe school\u2019s curriculum. Later the mature Kant\u2019s emphasis\non reason and autonomy, rather than emotion and dependence on either\nauthority or grace, may in part reflect his youthful reaction against\nPietism. But although the young Kant loathed his Pietist schooling, he\nhad deep respect and admiration for his parents, especially his\nmother, whose \u201cgenuine religiosity\u201d he described as\n\u201cnot at all enthusiastic.\u201d According to his biographer,\nManfred Kuehn, Kant\u2019s parents probably influenced him much less\nthrough their Pietism than through their artisan values of \u201chard\nwork, honesty, cleanliness, and independence,\u201d which they taught\nhim by\n example.[2]\n\n\nKant attended college at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg, known as\nthe Albertina, where his early interest in classics was quickly\nsuperseded by philosophy, which all first year students studied and\nwhich encompassed mathematics and physics as well as logic,\nmetaphysics, ethics, and natural law. Kant\u2019s philosophy\nprofessors exposed him to the approach of Christian Wolff\n(1679\u20131750), whose critical synthesis of the philosophy of G. W.\nLeibniz (1646\u20131716) was then very influential in German\nuniversities. But Kant was also exposed to a range of German and\nBritish critics of Wolff, and there were strong doses of\nAristotelianism and Pietism represented in the philosophy faculty as\nwell. Kant\u2019s favorite teacher was Martin Knutzen\n(1713\u20131751), a Pietist who was heavily influenced by both Wolff\nand the English philosopher John Locke (1632\u20131704). Knutzen\nintroduced Kant to the work of Isaac Newton (1642\u20131727), and his\ninfluence is visible in Kant\u2019s first published work,\nThoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces (1747),\nwhich was a critical attempt to mediate a dispute in natural\nphilosophy between Leibnizians and Newtonians over the proper\nmeasurement of force.\n\nAfter college Kant spent six years as a private tutor to young\nchildren outside K\u00f6nigsberg. By this time both of his parents had\ndied and Kant\u2019s finances were not yet secure enough for him to\npursue an academic career. He finally returned to K\u00f6nigsberg in\n1754 and began teaching at the Albertina the following year. For the\nnext four decades Kant taught philosophy there, until his retirement\nfrom teaching in 1796 at the age of seventy-two.\n\nKant had a burst of publishing activity in the years after he returned\nfrom working as a private tutor. In 1754 and 1755 he published three\nscientific works \u2013 one of which, Universal Natural History\nand Theory of the Heavens (1755), was a major book in which,\namong other things, he developed what later became known as the\nnebular hypothesis about the formation of the solar system.\nUnfortunately, the printer went bankrupt and the book had little\nimmediate impact. To secure qualifications for teaching at the\nuniversity, Kant also wrote two Latin dissertations: the first,\nentitled Concise Outline of Some Reflections on Fire (1755),\nearned him the Magister degree; and the second, New Elucidation of\nthe First Principles of Metaphysical Cognition (1755), entitled\nhim to teach as an unsalaried lecturer. The following year he\npublished another Latin work, The Employment in Natural Philosophy\nof Metaphysics Combined with Geometry, of Which Sample I Contains the\nPhysical Monadology (1756), in hopes of succeeding Knutzen as\nassociate professor of logic and metaphysics, though Kant failed to\nsecure this position. Both the New Elucidation, which was\nKant\u2019s first work concerned mainly with metaphysics, and the\nPhysical Monadology further develop the position on the\ninteraction of finite substances that he first outlined in Living\nForces. Both works depart from Leibniz-Wolffian views, though not\nradically. The New Elucidation in particular shows the\ninfluence of Christian August Crusius (1715\u20131775), a German\ncritic of\n Wolff.[3]\n\nAs an unsalaried lecturer at the Albertina Kant was paid directly by\nthe students who attended his lectures, so he needed to teach an\nenormous amount and to attract many students in order to earn a\nliving. Kant held this position from 1755 to 1770, during which period\nhe would lecture an average of twenty hours per week on logic,\nmetaphysics, and ethics, as well as mathematics, physics, and physical\ngeography. In his lectures Kant used textbooks by Wolffian authors\nsuch as Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714\u20131762) and Georg\nFriedrich Meier (1718\u20131777), but he followed them loosely and\nused them to structure his own reflections, which drew on a wide range\nof ideas of contemporary interest. These ideas often stemmed from\nBritish sentimentalist philosophers such as David Hume\n(1711\u20131776) and Francis Hutcheson (1694\u20131747), some of\nwhose texts were translated into German in the mid-1750s; and from the\nSwiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712\u20131778), who\npublished a flurry of works in the early 1760s. From early in his\ncareer Kant was a popular and successful lecturer. He also quickly\ndeveloped a local reputation as a promising young intellectual and cut\na dashing figure in K\u00f6nigsberg society.\n\nAfter several years of relative quiet, Kant unleashed another burst of\npublications in 1762\u20131764, including five philosophical works.\nThe False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures (1762)\nrehearses criticisms of Aristotelian logic that were developed by\nother German philosophers. The Only Possible Argument in Support\nof a Demonstration of the Existence of God (1762\u20133) is a\nmajor book in which Kant drew on his earlier work in Universal\nHistory and New Elucidation to develop an original\nargument for God\u2019s existence as a condition of the internal\npossibility of all things, while criticizing other arguments for\nGod\u2019s existence. The book attracted several positive and some\nnegative reviews. In 1762 Kant also submitted an essay entitled\nInquiry Concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural\nTheology and Morality to a prize competition by the Prussian\nRoyal Academy, though Kant\u2019s submission took second prize to\nMoses Mendelssohn\u2019s winning essay (and was published with it in\n1764). Kant\u2019s Prize Essay, as it is known, departs more\nsignificantly from Leibniz-Wolffian views than his earlier work and\nalso contains his first extended discussion of moral philosophy in\nprint. The Prize Essay draws on British sources to criticize\nGerman rationalism in two respects: first, drawing on Newton, Kant\ndistinguishes between the methods of mathematics and philosophy; and\nsecond, drawing on Hutcheson, he claims that \u201can unanalysable\nfeeling of the good\u201d supplies the material content of our moral\nobligations, which cannot be demonstrated in a purely intellectual way\nfrom the formal principle of perfection alone\n (2:299).[4]\n These themes reappear in the Attempt to Introduce the Concept of\nNegative Magnitudes into Philosophy (1763), whose main thesis,\nhowever, is that the real opposition of conflicting forces, as in\ncausal relations, is not reducible to the logical relation of\ncontradiction, as Leibnizians held. In Negative Magnitudes\nKant also argues that the morality of an action is a function of the\ninternal forces that motivate one to act, rather than of the external\n(physical) actions or their consequences. Finally, Observations on\nthe Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime (1764) deals mainly\nwith alleged differences in the tastes of men and women and of people\nfrom different cultures. After it was published, Kant filled his own\ninterleaved copy of this book with (often unrelated) handwritten\nremarks, many of which reflect the deep influence of Rousseau on his\nthinking about moral philosophy in the mid-1760s.\n\nThese works helped to secure Kant a broader reputation in Germany, but\nfor the most part they were not strikingly original. Like other German\nphilosophers at the time, Kant\u2019s early works are generally\nconcerned with using insights from British empiricist authors to\nreform or broaden the German rationalist tradition without radically\nundermining its foundations. While some of his early works tend to\nemphasize rationalist ideas, others have a more empiricist emphasis.\nDuring this time Kant was striving to work out an independent\nposition, but before the 1770s his views remained fluid.\n\nIn 1766 Kant published his first work concerned with the possibility\nof metaphysics, which later became a central topic of his mature\nphilosophy. Dreams of a Spirit-Seer Elucidated by Dreams of\nMetaphysics, which he wrote soon after publishing a short\nEssay on Maladies of the Mind (1764), was occasioned by\nKant\u2019s fascination with the Swedish visionary Emanuel Swedenborg\n(1688\u20131772), who claimed to have insight into a spirit world\nthat enabled him to make a series of apparently miraculous\npredictions. In this curious work Kant satirically compares\nSwedenborg\u2019s spirit-visions to the belief of rationalist\nmetaphysicians in an immaterial soul that survives death, and he\nconcludes that philosophical knowledge of either is impossible because\nhuman reason is limited to experience. The skeptical tone of Dreams is\ntempered, however, by Kant\u2019s suggestion that \u201cmoral\nfaith\u201d nevertheless supports belief in an immaterial and\nimmortal soul, even if it is not possible to attain metaphysical\nknowledge in this domain (2:373).\n\nIn 1770, at the age of forty-six, Kant was appointed to the chair in\nlogic and metaphysics at the Albertina, after teaching for fifteen\nyears as an unsalaried lecturer and working since 1766 as a\nsublibrarian to supplement his income. Kant was turned down for the\nsame position in 1758. But later, as his reputation grew, he declined\nchairs in philosophy at Erlangen (1769) and Jena (1770) in hopes of\nobtaining one in K\u00f6nigsberg. After Kant was finally promoted, he\ngradually extended his repertoire of lectures to include anthropology\n(Kant\u2019s was the first such course in Germany and became very\npopular), rational theology, pedagogy, natural right, and even\nmineralogy and military fortifications. In order to inaugurate his new\nposition, Kant also wrote one more Latin dissertation: Concerning\nthe Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World\n(1770), which is known as the Inaugural Dissertation.\n\nThe Inaugural Dissertation departs more radically from both\nWolffian rationalism and British sentimentalism than Kant\u2019s\nearlier work. Inspired by Crusius and the Swiss natural philosopher\nJohann Heinrich Lambert (1728\u20131777), Kant distinguishes between\ntwo fundamental powers of cognition, sensibility and understanding\n(intelligence), where the Leibniz-Wolffians regarded understanding\n(intellect) as the only fundamental power. Kant therefore rejects the\nrationalist view that sensibility is only a confused species of\nintellectual cognition, and he replaces this with his own view that\nsensibility is distinct from understanding and brings to perception\nits own subjective forms of space and time \u2013 a view that\ndeveloped out of Kant\u2019s earlier criticism of Leibniz\u2019s\nrelational view of space in Concerning the Ultimate Ground of the\nDifferentiation of Directions in Space (1768). Moreover, as the\ntitle of the Inaugural Dissertation indicates, Kant argues\nthat sensibility and understanding are directed at two different\nworlds: sensibility gives us access to the sensible world, while\nunderstanding enables us to grasp a distinct intelligible world. These\ntwo worlds are related in that what the understanding grasps in the\nintelligible world is the \u201cparadigm\u201d of \u201cNOUMENAL\nPERFECTION,\u201d which is \u201ca common measure for all other\nthings in so far as they are realities.\u201d Considered\ntheoretically, this intelligible paradigm of perfection is God;\nconsidered practically, it is \u201cMORAL PERFECTION\u201d (2:396).\nThe Inaugural Dissertation thus develops a form of Platonism;\nand it rejects the view of British sentimentalists that moral\njudgments are based on feelings of pleasure or pain, since Kant now\nholds that moral judgments are based on pure understanding alone.\n\nAfter 1770 Kant never surrendered the views that sensibility and\nunderstanding are distinct powers of cognition, that space and time\nare subjective forms of human sensibility, and that moral judgments\nare based on pure understanding (or reason) alone. But his embrace of\nPlatonism in the Inaugural Dissertation was short-lived. He\nsoon denied that our understanding is capable of insight into an\nintelligible world, which cleared the path toward his mature position\nin the Critique of Pure Reason (1781), according to which the\nunderstanding (like sensibility) supplies forms that structure our\nexperience of the sensible world, to which human knowledge is limited,\nwhile the intelligible (or noumenal) world is strictly unknowable to\nus. Kant spent a decade working on the Critique of Pure\nReason and published nothing else of significance between 1770\nand 1781. But its publication marked the beginning of another burst of\nactivity that produced Kant\u2019s most important and enduring works.\nBecause early reviews of the Critique of Pure Reason were few\nand (in Kant\u2019s judgment) uncomprehending, he tried to clarify\nits main points in the much shorter Prolegomena to Any Future\nMetaphysics That Will Be Able to Come Forward as a Science\n(1783). Among the major books that rapidly followed are the\nGroundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), Kant\u2019s\nmain work on the fundamental principle of morality; the\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786), his main\nwork on natural philosophy in what scholars call his critical period\n(1781\u20131798); the second and substantially revised edition of the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1787); the Critique of Practical\nReason (1788), a fuller discussion of topics in moral philosophy\nthat builds on (and in some ways revises) the Groundwork; and\nthe Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790), which deals\nwith aesthetics and teleology. Kant also published a number of\nimportant essays in this period, including Idea for a Universal\nHistory With a Cosmopolitan Aim (1784) and Conjectural\nBeginning of Human History (1786), his main contributions to the\nphilosophy of history; An Answer to the Question: What is\nEnlightenment? (1784), which broaches some of the key ideas of\nhis later political essays; and What Does it Mean to Orient\nOneself in Thinking? (1786), Kant\u2019s intervention in the\npantheism controversy that raged in German intellectual circles after\nF. H. Jacobi (1743\u20131819) accused the recently deceased G. E.\nLessing (1729\u20131781) of Spinozism.\n\nWith these works Kant secured international fame and came to dominate\nGerman philosophy in the late 1780s. But in 1790 he announced that the\nCritique of the Power of Judgment brought his critical\nenterprise to an end (5:170). By then K. L. Reinhold\n(1758\u20131823), whose Letters on the Kantian Philosophy\n(1786) popularized Kant\u2019s moral and religious ideas, had been\ninstalled (in 1787) in a chair devoted to Kantian philosophy at Jena,\nwhich was more centrally located than K\u00f6nigsberg and rapidly\ndeveloping into the focal point of the next phase in German\nintellectual history. Reinhold soon began to criticize and move away\nfrom Kant\u2019s views. In 1794 his chair at Jena passed to J. G.\nFichte, who had visited the master in K\u00f6nigsberg and whose first\nbook, Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation (1792), was\npublished anonymously and initially mistaken for a work by Kant\nhimself. This catapulted Fichte to fame, but soon he too moved away\nfrom Kant and developed an original position quite at odds with\nKant\u2019s, which Kant finally repudiated publicly in 1799\n(12:370\u2013371). Yet while German philosophy moved on to assess and\nrespond to Kant\u2019s legacy, Kant himself continued publishing\nimportant works in the 1790s. Among these are Religion Within the\nBoundaries of Mere Reason (1793), which drew a censure from the\nPrussian King when Kant published the book after its second essay was\nrejected by the censor; The Conflict of the Faculties (1798),\na collection of essays inspired by Kant\u2019s troubles with the\ncensor and dealing with the relationship between the philosophical and\ntheological faculties of the university; On the Common Saying:\nThat May be Correct in Theory, But it is of No Use in Practice\n(1793), Toward Perpetual Peace (1795), and the Doctrine\nof Right, the first part of The Metaphysics of Morals\n(1797), Kant\u2019s main works in political philosophy; the\nDoctrine of Virtue, the second part of The Metaphysics of\nMorals (1797), Kant\u2019s most mature work in moral philosophy,\nwhich he had been planning for more than thirty years; and\nAnthropology From a Pragmatic Point of View (1798), based on\nKant\u2019s anthropology lectures. Several other compilations of\nKant\u2019s lecture notes from other courses were published later,\nbut these were not prepared by Kant himself.\n\nKant retired from teaching in 1796. For nearly two decades he had\nlived a highly disciplined life focused primarily on completing his\nphilosophical system, which began to take definite shape in his mind\nonly in middle age. After retiring he came to believe that there was a\ngap in this system separating the metaphysical foundations of natural\nscience from physics itself, and he set out to close this gap in a\nseries of notes that postulate the existence of an ether or caloric\nmatter. These notes, known as the Opus Postumum, remained\nunfinished and unpublished in Kant\u2019s lifetime, and scholars\ndisagree on their significance and relation to his earlier work. It is\nclear, however, that some of these late notes show unmistakable signs\nof Kant\u2019s mental decline, which became tragically precipitous\naround 1800. Kant died February 12, 1804, just short of his eightieth\nbirthday.\n",
