    "main_text": "Conceptual Art \u2013 What Is It? || Artistic Media\n1.3 Artistic Media\n\nAs a direct result of its examination of what may properly qualify as\nart, and of the markedly broad conception of what may constitute an\nart object resulting from this examination, conceptual art tends to\nreject traditional artistic media such as conventional painting or\nsculpture. Instead, it has found itself drawn to alternative means of\nexpression, including performances, photography, films, videos,\nevents, bodies, new ready-mades and new mixed media. In a nutshell,\nnothing can be ruled out in principle for use as possible artistic\nmedia, as can be seen, for example, in Richard Long\u2019s photograph\nof a line made in the grass by\n walking[2],\n Bruce Nauman\u2019s nine minute film of the artist himself playing\none note on a violin whilst walking around in his\n studio[3],\n Janine Antoni\u2019s use of chocolate and soap, Marina\nAbramovic\u2019s display of an array of everyday objects, including\nknives, torches and feathers, which the audience is invited to apply\ndirectly on to the artist\u2019s body, and Piero Manzoni\u2019s act\nof signing a woman\u2019s\n arm[4].\n",
