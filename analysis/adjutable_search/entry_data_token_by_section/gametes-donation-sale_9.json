    "main_text": "Donor Anonymity || Family Cohesion\n2.3 Family Cohesion\n\nAnother argument against donor anonymity is that secrecy about origins\nhas the potential to damage the relationships between donor-conceived\nchildren and their social parents, especially in cases where the\nsocial parent(s) know the identity of the gamete donor(s) Some argue\nthat the strain of having to \u2018keep the secret\u2019 is a cause\nof stress for social parents, and that this stress has a negative\nimpact on familial wellbeing (Landau 1998). A potentially more\nsignificant source of family tension is accidental disclosure,\nespecially when donor-conceived children are older. In this latter\ncase, several harms might arise, and may be greatly exacerbated if\nchildren were not aware that they were donor-conceived. Children might\ndevelop feelings of distrust towards their social parents, and may\nhave difficulty incorporating facts about their genetic history into\ntheir personal identity (Turner & Coyle 2000).\n\nWhile harms caused by both secrecy and accidental disclosure can be\nmitigated to some extent without making identifiable information\navailable, by simply disclosing to children at a young age that they\nare donor-conceived for example, some argue that more openness is\nbetter for familial unity, and that providing children with an\nopportunity to find out the identity of their donors (even if that is\ndelayed until they are older) is usually best (Nuffield Council on\nBioethics 2009).\n\nThose who favour permitting anonymous gamete donation argue that, at\nbest, the evidence suggests a slight improvement in familial wellbeing\nwhen information about a donor is provided along with disclosure about\nthe method of their conception. Families in which children do not have\naccess to identifying information about their donors still report good\nhome-life and have positive relationships with their parents\n(Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014). Thus, while non-disclosure might not be\noptimal, it is probably not so harmful that it falls outside of the\ndomain of parental discretion. Furthermore, if the harms are socially\nconstructed, as some have argued is the case in genealogical\nbewilderment, then we may have additional reasons for concluding that\nthe harms to family cohesion do not justify prohibiting anonymous\ndonation, since doing so would only further contribute to biologism\n(Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014).\n",
