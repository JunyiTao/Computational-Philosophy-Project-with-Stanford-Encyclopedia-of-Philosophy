Arguments against Ethical Supervenience, or its Significance\n\nAs the preceding sections have shown, philosophers have tried to\nextract a number of striking conclusions using ethical supervenience\nas a premise. Part of the motivation for these attempts is that\nethical supervenience is widely assumed to be a powerful dialectical\nweapon, such that if your view is incompatible with ethical\nsupervenience, it is in trouble. This section considers challenges to\nthis status.\n",
