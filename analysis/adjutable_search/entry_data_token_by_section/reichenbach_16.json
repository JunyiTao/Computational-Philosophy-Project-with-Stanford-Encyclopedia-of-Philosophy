    "main_text": "Reichenbach\u2019s Influence\n8. Retrospective\n\nHilary Putnam (1991) has praised Reichenbach\u2019s work as\n\u201cone of the most magnificent attempts by any empiricist\nphilosopher of this or of any other century\u201d and called for more\nhistorical study of his work. We do not disagree, but a candid\nphilosophical retrospective assessment of any major philosopher is\nbound to find flaws. As Putnam emphasizes, in the end Reichenbach\ntried to found epistemology and metaphysics on probability relations,\nbut he evaded or dismissed coherent and pointed challenges from Ernest\nNagel and others as to how his conception of probability could serve\nthe purposes he required of it. Reichenbach\u2019s work repeatedly\nignored or discounted the contemporaneous or prior efforts of others\nthat address the issues that concerned him, efforts that are in one or\nanother way as good as, or importantly better, than his own. That is\ntrue with respect to Robb with regard to the causal construction of\nspace-time relations; it is true with respect to Kolmogorov with\nregard to the theory of probability; it is true with respect to\nBirkhoff and von Neumann with regard to quantum logic. The effect has\nbeen to make much of Reichenbach\u2019s best-known work something of\na scientific and philosophical eddy rather than a main current.\nReichenbach nonetheless was a central figure in forming the mainstream\nof 20th century philosophy of science as a crossdisciplinary study\ndevoted to reconstructing and \u201cjustifying\u201d received\nscience rather than to proposing novel scientific frameworks or novel\nmethodologies. At least in that fundamental respect, he remained a\nKantian throughout his career. \n",
