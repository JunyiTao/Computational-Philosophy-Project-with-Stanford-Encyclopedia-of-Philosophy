    "main_text": "Evolution and development in historical context\n1. Evolution and development in historical context\n\nOriginally, the concepts of evolution and development were closely\nconnected. In fact, since the end of the 17th century the\nconcept of \u2018evolution\u2019 was widely used to describe\nindividual developmental processes, and \u2018developmental\nhypotheses\u2019 often referred to what is now called evolution. In\naddition, development (\u2018Entwicklung\u2019) was often considered\nto not only describe ontogenetic changes in organisms (Goethe 1790;\nDebraw 1777) but also (what we consider today) phylogenetic changes.\nFor example, Friedrich W.J. Schelling (1798) states that the sequence\nof stages of all organic beings took shape through the gradual\ndevelopment (\u2018Entwicklung\u2019) of the same organization. This\nsituation changed in the beginning of the 19th century when\nevolution was used by some authors for labeling transgenerational\ntransformations of organisms, among others by Charles Lyell and Georg\nW.F. Hegel. However, in his first edition of his Origin of\nSpecies (1859) Darwin did not use the term evolution, likely\nbecause he wanted to distance his theory from earlier developmental\nunderstandings of the word. Instead, he spoke of \u2018descent with\nmodification.\u2019 But especially due to the work of Herbert\nSpencer, evolution became established as a concept that concerns the\n\u201ctransformation of species\u201d, and Darwin\u2019s theory of\ntransformation through selection was increasingly seen as the exemplar\nof a \u201ctheory of evolution\u201d (Spencer 1852 [1891], 1).\nAccording to this theory, evolution is driven through organisms\n\u201cstruggle for existence\u201d (Darwin) and the \u201csurvival\nof the fittest\u201d (Spencer).\n\nBesides this increasing conceptual parting, however, evolution and\ndevelopment were considered to be closely interrelated processes by\nmany scholars throughout the 19th century. By building on\nearlier comparative studies of embryonic processes across various taxa\n(among others by Karl E. von Baer (1827) and Fritz M\u00fcller\n(1864)), Ernst Haeckel (1872) argued that all metazoans have the same\nearly stages of development (see Gould 1977). He understood these\ndevelopmental patterns as modifications of a basic type. According to\nthis biogenetic law, the development of individuals is a\nrecapitulation of species\u2019 evolutionary changes:\n\n\nDuring the rapid and short course of its individual development, the\norganic individual [\u2026] repeats the most important changes of\nform, which its ancestors passed through during their long and slow\ncourse of paleontological development, following the laws of heredity\nand adaptation. (Haeckel 1866, II 300)\n\n\nThis relationship, whereby biodiversity progressively arose from\nchanges in development, was already anticipated by Johann F. Meckel\n(1812) and Richard Owen (1837), who parallelized\n\u2018transmutations\u2019 of embryonic forms and transmutations of\nspecies. Also Darwin (1837) describes the genesis of individuals as a\n\u2018shortened repetition\u2019 of morphological changes during\nphylogeny. From the end of the 19th century this view of\ndevelopment as a recapitulation of evolution became problematic (see\nRasmussen 1991). First, during this time the view of a linear\nevolution from invertebrates over vertebrates to humans was\nincreasingly questioned. Second, based on comparative studies of cell\nlineages across different taxa in the 1890s, scholars criticized that\nnot only adult organisms but their developmental pathways evolve, too.\nFor example, in 1898, embryologist Edmund B. Wilson (1898) was using\nhomologous patterns of embryonic cell division to unite taxa, while\nembryologist Frank R. Lillie (1898) studied differences in these\npatterns to show the origins of evolutionary adaptations. These\nstudies were (at least to some part) in conflict with Haeckel\u2019s\nrecapitulationism, as they saw ontogeny not as sufficiently explained\nby historical causes, but rather in need of independent mechanistic\nlaws operating on physical properties of the ontogenetic material (see\nGuralnick 2002). In addition, this cell lineage research suggested\nthat Haeckel\u2019s law on the relationship between development and\nevolution should be inverted, as cell lineages evolve over\nevolutionary time. In more general terms, this means that development\ndoes not merely mimic evolution. Rather, it is a source of variation\nand thus a cause of evolution and adaptation: \u201contogeny does not\nrecapitulate phylogeny, it creates it\u201d (Garstang 1922: 81). In\nshort, evolution proceeds through modifications of development.\n\nAnother characteristic of 19th century (and early\n20th century) biology was the lack of a clear conceptual\nparting between developmental and reproductive processes. Especially\nthe idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics was part of\nthe mainstream of evolutionary thought (Bowler 1983, 2017; Gissis\n& Jablonka 2011). According to Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1809),\nchanges in the structure or function of traits that occurred during an\norganism\u2019s life, depending on their use or disuse, could be\ninherited. Darwin adopted this idea in his inheritance theory of\npangenesis (see Holterhoff 2014). He suggested that all body parts, at\neach developmental stage, contain small particles, so-called\n\u2018gemmules,\u2019 that were sensitive to environmental changes.\nThese particles accumulate in the reproductive organs and are\ntransmitted to the next generation. Thus, gemmules modified during\ndevelopment lead to modifications in the next generation. Darwin\nstated that due to this close connection of development and\nreproduction, \u201cinheritance must be looked at as merely a form of\ngrowth\u201d (Darwin 1868: II, 404). However, this connection between\ndevelopment and inheritance was increasingly criticized in the first\nhalf of the 20th century. Following August Weismann (1892),\nthe inheritance of environmentally induced variation in somatic cells\n(the body) of organisms was increasingly called into question. In\nsexually reproducing organisms, only the germ plasm used for the sperm\nand eggs were recognized as carrying information that are passed on to\nthe next generation. According to this view, the germ line was immune\nfrom variation occurring in the somatic cells of the body, and thus\nthe inheritance of acquired characteristics or other theories of\nplasmatic inheritance were rejected (but see Harwood 1993, Gilbert\n& Epel 2015). \n\nThis parting between development, on the one side, and inheritance and\nevolution, on the other, through Weismann\u2019s theory of\ninheritance, had long lasting effects on how biologists reasoned about\nevolution in the following years. Despite continuing efforts of\nneo-Lamarckians well into the 1930s (Bowler 1983), development\nincreasingly vanished from the landscape of evolutionary theory. By\nuniting Mendel\u2019s laws and new findings in genetics within the\nstatistical framework of population genetics, the modern synthesis\ncame to understand evolution as a change in the frequencies of\ndifferent alleles in a population (Fisher 1930; Dobzhansky 1951).\nVariation relevant to evolution was produced only in the genes of the\ngerm line. These random changes, mutations, were screened off from the\ndevelopmental history of the individual. In the 1940s and 50s this\nview was increasingly manifested, not least through the so-called\n\u2018central dogma\u2019 of molecular biology (Crick 1958). It\nstates (similar to Weismann\u2019s theory) that information flows\nalways from the DNA to proteins, never vice versa. Thus, phenotypic\nchanges during development could not affect the genes. The trend to\nlink genes with populations in evolutionary explanations, rather than\ndevelopment with evolution reached its climax with the gene\u2019s\neye view of evolution (Williams 1966; Dawkins 1976). By focusing on\nthe question how certain traits like altruistic behaviors could be\nbeneficial, it not only identified genes (rather than organisms) as\nthe sole units of selection. In addition, it described development as\nnothing but the readout of a genetic program (Maienschein 2003;\nPigliucci 2010). Genes control the development of traits and\norganisms\u2019 behaviors, and they replicate to secure their own\nfurther propagation in groups and populations.\n\nDuring the twentieth century these partings of development and\nevolution led to statements such as: \u201cProblems concerned with\nthe orderly development of the individual are unrelated to those of\nthe evolution of organisms through time\u201d (Wallace 1986: 149).\nHowever, such statements were also targeted by a number of critics.\nFor example, the exclusion of developmental biology from the modern\nsynthesis (Harrison 1937; De Beer 1954; Waddington 1957; Hamburger\n1980), the explanatory autocracy of the adaptationist program in\nevolutionary biology (Gould & Lewontin 1979), and the omission of\na satisfying theory of evolutionary novelty, in which development\nwould play a role (Goldschmidt 1940), have been criticized. Not least\ndue to this rejection of developmental perspectives, evolutionary\ntheory has been blamed to constrain the direction of research in\nevolutionary biology (Provine 1989). In fact, throughout the twentieth\ncentury a number of theories have been put forward, which argue that\ndue to the partial independence of genetic and phenotypic variation,\nevolutionary research should put more emphasis on how the changes in\ndevelopmental and behavioral patterns might drive or bias evolutionary\nchange. This includes cases of \u2018canalized\u2019 developmental\npathway which are maintained, even though the genotype or the\nenvironment might have changed to some degree (Waddington 1957; see\nalso Nijhout 2002; Gilbert & Epel 2015; Sultan 2015). In addition,\nstudies of phenotypic plasticity showed that a trait of an organism\ncan react to an environmental input in various ways, and that the\ngenome codes for a wide range of potential phenotypes (Waddington\n1942; Nijhout 1990; Pigliucci 2001). The evolutionary relevance of\nthese findings was emphasized by studies that investigated how the\nrange of variation changes from a plastic trait to a fixed or\ncanalized one over the course of generations (Suzuki and Nijhout 2008;\nWest-Eberhard 2003; B. Baker et al. 2019). What is more, according to\nthe so-called \u2018Baldwin effect,\u2019 learned behavioral\npatterns (e.g., the acclimatization to a new stressor) that were\ninitially rather plastic, can affect the reproductive success of\nindividuals and thus, across generations and through natural\nselection, be gradually incorporated into the genetic and epigenetic\nmakeup of a species (Baldwin 1896; Simpson 1953; Piaget 1976 [1978];\nNewman 2002). While some of these developmental perspectives on\nevolution were consistent with the population genetic framework of\nevolutionary biology and were, in fact, gradually incorporated into\nevolutionary thought, others posed more serious challenges for\ntheoretical integration.\n\nBy building on the latter, more problematic set of approaches\n(especially in recent years), evolutionary theory has been facing\ncalls from developmentally oriented biologists and philosophers of\nbiology to widen the standard explanatory and methodological\napproaches on evolution (Bonner 1958; Alberch 1982; Bonner 1982; Raff\n& Kaufman 1983; Gilbert, Opitz, & Raff 1996; Schlichting &\nPigliucci 1998; West-Eberhard 2003; G. M\u00fcller 2007; Pigliucci\n& M\u00fcller 2010; Bateson & Gluckman 2011; Jablonka &\nLamb 2014; Laland et al. 2014, 2015; Gilbert & Epel 2015; G. M\u00fcller 2017; for discussion, see Huneman\n& Walsh 2017; F\u00e1bregas-Tejeda & Vergara-Silva 2018; Baedke et al. 2020b). They argue that evolutionary change should not only or\nprimarily be investigated and explained as a change in genotype\nfrequencies in populations but (also) on the level of the developing\nand acting individual. The underlying idea is that phenotypic\nvariation and the flexibility of organisms\u2019 responses to\nenvironmental cues may introduce non-random variation and thus may\nbias and/or direct morphological evolution to some degree. This\nincludes not only environmentally induced changes in regulatory\nprocesses but also the physical constraints of the developing embryo.\nBy focusing on these phenomena, Kevin Laland and colleagues (2014:\n161) state: \u201cAn alternative vision of evolution is beginning to\ncrystallize, in which the processes by which organisms grow and\ndevelop are recognized as causes of evolution\u201d. Others have\nargued that genes are probably more often followers in evolution than\nleaders (West-Eberhard 2003, 2005). In other words, the\nenvironmentally responsive, developing and acting organism takes the\nlead. It introduces in a non-random way new phenotypes into\npopulations that are subsequently stabilized by genes.\n\nThis \u2018development first view\u2019 (or sometimes called\n\u2018plasticity first view\u2019) of evolution is currently adopted\nespecially by researchers in three fields of research: evolutionary\ndevelopmental biology (evo-devo), epigenetics, and niche construction\ntheory. Evo-devo studies how developmental pathways evolve and, more\nimportant for the above view, how developmental constraints and biases\ncan affect evolutionary trajectories (Raff 1996, 2000; Gerhart &\nKirschner 1997; Love 2003; Amundson 2005; Laubichler & Maienschein\n2007; Sansom & Brandon 2007; G. M\u00fcller 2007; Minelli 2009;\nLaubichler 2010; Pigliucci & M\u00fcller 2010; Gilbert & Epel\n2015; Moczek et al. 2015; Levis & Pfennig 2020). This includes\nasking how changes in gene regulatory networks cause modifications of\ndevelopmental processes (associated with major shifts in morphological\n\u2018body plans\u2019) and thus produce evolutionary novelties, or\nwhat capacities organisms have to generate heritable, adaptive\nphenotypic variation and thus to evolve in evolution (i.e. their\nevolvability; see Hendrikse et al. 2007). This focus on how phenotypic\nvariation is produced, rather than how it is selected, is supported by\nstudies in epigenetics on inter- and transgenerational epigenetic\ninheritance (see the entry\n inheritance systems),\n like through the transmission of regulatory factors of gene activity\n(Jablonka & Lamb 1989, 2014, Janlonka & Raz 2009, Perez &\nLehner 2019). Other forms of extra-genetic inheritance include the\ntransmission of microbiota (Gilbert et al. 2012, 2014, Browne et al.\n2017) and behaviorally mediated parental effects (Kappeler &\nMeaney 2010; Rilling & Young 2014). This set of processes contains\nenvironmentally sensitive non-genetic sources of variation for\norganisms that can be transmitted across generations, in many cases\ndecoupled from the transfer of genetic information. Finally, niche\nconstruction theory highlights the self-perpetuating and reciprocal\neffects of organisms, as agents, that construct their own niche\n(and/or that of other species) during development (Lewontin 1982;\nSterelny 2001; Day et al. 2003; Odling-Smee et al. 2003; Laland et al.\n2008, 2009, 2011; Odling-Smee 2010; Chiu & Gilbert 2015, 2020; Aaby & Ramsey forthcoming).\nThese recent studies on developmental evolution will be discussed in\ndetail in section 3.\n\nThe various developments in the above fields have led to an increasing\nphilosophical interest in conceptual and explanatory issues arising\nfrom the new junction of development and evolution. These include\nclarifying what causal relationships and boundaries exist between the\ntwo realms, which different roles developmental processes play in\nrecent evolutionary research, and how these new roles affect\nontological frameworks of the organism. In addition, these\ndevelopments have been accompanied by debates about the structure of\nexplanations in developmental evolution. Finally, they have informed\ndiscussions on anthropological understandings and ethical questions\nconcerning humans. We will now discuss the debates on these issues in\ndetail. \n",
