    "main_text": "Aristotelian Background\n2. Aristotelian Background\n\n\nAlthough Aristotle discusses relations at various places in his work,\nhis discussion in the Categories is the most important for\nunderstanding the development of medieval theories of relations. Part\nof the reason, as we have already indicated, is historical: until the\ntwelfth century, the Categories is the medievals\u2019 sole\ndirect source for Aristotle\u2019s views about relations. But part of\nthe reason is more theoretical: in the Categories Aristotle\ndevelops a basic account of relations that is presupposed by his other\ndiscussions. Thus, even when some of these other discussions become\navailable\u2014discussions such as those in the Physics and\nMetaphysics\u2014medieval philosophers continue to interpret\nthem in light of their understanding of the Categories.\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s discussion in the Categories influences the\ndevelopment of medieval views about relations in several discernible\nways. First of all, it introduces the basic framework and terminology\nthat comes to dominate all medieval theorizing about\nrelations. Second, and perhaps most importantly, it articulates the\nmain claims in response to which medieval philosophers develop their\nown views, including each of the following: (1) relations are the\nitems that relate substances, (2) the items that relate substances are\naccidents, and (3) no substance is a relation.\n\n\nFinally, the details of Aristotle\u2019s discussion in the\nCategories, especially in chapter 7, give rise to a number of\nimportant medieval debates, as well as the traditional distinction\nbetween relations merely according to speech (relationes secundum\ndici) vs. relations according to being (relationes\nsecundum esse). In order to understand the development\nof medieval views about relations, therefore, we must begin with some\naccount of Aristotle\u2019s discussion in the\nCategories.\n",
