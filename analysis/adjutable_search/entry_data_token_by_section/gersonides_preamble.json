    "main_text": "\n\nPerhaps no other medieval Jewish philosopher has been so maligned over\nthe centuries as Gersonides (Levi ben Gerson, acronym Ralbag). Indeed,\nhis major philosophical work, Sefer Milhamot Ha-Shem (The\nWar of the Lord, 1329), was called \u201cWars against the\nLord\u201d by one of his opponents. Despite the vilification of\nhis position, Gersonides emerges as one of the most significant and\ncomprehensive thinkers in the medieval Jewish tradition. He has been\nconstantly quoted (even if only to be criticized), and, through the\nworks of Hasdai Crescas and others, Gersonides\u2019 ideas have\ninfluenced such thinkers as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Benedict de\nSpinoza. This article will survey his major contributions to medieval\nphilosophy.\n",
