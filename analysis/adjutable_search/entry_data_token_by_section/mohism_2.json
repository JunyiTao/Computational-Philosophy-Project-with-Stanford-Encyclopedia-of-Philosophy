    "main_text": "The Search for Objective Standards\n3. The Search for Objective Standards\n\n\nA central concern in Mohist thought is to secure zhi\n(pronounced \u201cjr\u201d), or moral, social, and political order, an intrinsic\ngood that the Mohists assume everyone in society will value. According\nto Mohist\n political theory,\n this aim is\nachieved by unifying society\u2019s moral standards, so that people will\nagree in their value judgments, thus eliminating any potential reasons\nfor conflict. The unified moral standards cannot be chosen arbitrarily,\nhowever, for if people see that the standards do not genuinely promote\nsocial and moral order, they will defy them. So a crucial question for\nthe Mohists is: What shall we take as the basis for unified moral norms? \n\n\nOne answer, accepted by many Ru (Confucians) and other\n\u201cgentlemen of the world\u201d criticized by the Mohists, is the li\n(ritual propriety, ceremony), a traditional code of propriety specifying behavior\nappropriate for individuals playing different social roles in various\ntypes of\n situations.[4]\n We can take the li, supplemented by\nthe situational discretion (quan) of the virtuous gentleman,\nas a basic standard of conduct. This solution of course presupposes a\nrough, gentlemanly consensus about what is and is not appropriate\nbehavior. Such a consensus seems to be assumed by the major Confucian\nfigure Mencius, for instance, who sees little need to develop an\nexplicit normative ethical theory, focusing instead on moral\npsychology.\n\n\nPerhaps partly because of their\n social origins,\n Mozi and his followers do not identify with the\nli (ritual) of the traditional high culture and so find this\nsort of traditionalist consensus an unconvincing moral guide. To the\nsuggestion that tradition can serve as a reliable moral standard, they\nrespond by distinguishing between traditional customs and morality as\nsuch, pointing out that conformity to tradition is not in itself\nsufficient to ensure moral correctness. They make this point by\nconsidering \u2014 at roughly the same time Herodotus was raising\nsimilar issues in Greece \u2014 the challenge to parochial\nconceptions of what is right posed by the existence of disparate\ncultural practices.\nNow those who uphold rich burials and prolonged mourning\nsay: \u201cIf rich burials and prolonged mourning turn out not to be\nthe Way of the sage-kings, then how do we explain why the gentlemen of\nthe central states perform them without ceasing and maintain them\nwithout choosing something else?!\u201d\n Our Master Mozi said, \u201cThis is what\u2019s called deeming their\nhabits convenient and their customs righteous. In the past, east of\nYue there was the country of Gai Shu. When their eldest son was born,\nthey chopped him up and ate him, calling this \u2018advantageous to the\nyounger brothers.\u2019 When their grandfather died, they carried off their\ngrandmother and abandoned her, saying, \u2018One cannot live with the wife\nof a ghost.\u2019 These practices superiors took as government policy and\nsubordinates took as custom, performing them without ceasing and\nmaintaining them without choosing something else. Yet how could these\nreally be the Way of benevolence and righteousness?!\u201d (Book 25,\n\u201cModeration in Burial\u201d)\n\n\n\nDifferent cultures may have different, conflicting customs, some of\nwhich may be morally wrong by our lights. Since other cultures\u2019\ncustoms may be wrong, by parity of reasoning, so might our own. The\nmere fact that a practice is traditional or customary, as\nthe li (rituals, ceremonies) are, does not show that it is\nright in the objective, universal sense expressed by moral concepts\nsuch as ren (benevolence) and yi (righteousness,\nmorality). The li thus cannot serve as an authoritative standard\nof a unified morality. We need to find other, objectively justified\nstandards.\n\n\nThis search for objective moral standards by which to guide action\nand reform society lies at the heart of the Mohist philosophical and\npolitical\n project.[5]\n The master idea driving Mohist thought is\nthat in ethics and politics, as in any other practical field, we can\nindeed find and apply such standards, which the Mohists call\nfa (models, paradigms, standards). A text from one of the\nlater portions of the Mozi explains the role of fa in\nthis way:\n\n\nOur Master Mozi said, \u201cThose in the world who perform tasks\ncannot do without models (fa) and standards. There is no one\nwho can accomplish their task without models and standards. Even\nofficers serving as generals or ministers, they all have models; even\nthe hundred artisans performing their tasks, they too all have\nmodels. The hundred artisans make squares with the set square, circles\nwith the compass, straight lines with the string, vertical lines with\nthe plumb line, and flat surfaces with the level. Whether skilled\nartisans or unskilled artisans, all take these five as models. The\nskilled are able to conform to them. The unskilled, though unable to\nconform to them, by following them in performing their tasks still\nsurpass what they can do by themselves. Thus the hundred artisans in\nperforming their tasks all have models to measure by.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow for the greatest to order (zhi, also\n\u2018govern\u2019) the world and those the next level down to order great\nstates without models to measure by, this is to be less\ndiscriminating than the hundred artisans.\u201d (Book 4, \u201cModels and\nStandards\u201d)\n\n\n\nAs this passage indicates, the Mohists regard fa (models) as\nsimilar to tools used to guide and check the performance of skilled\ntasks, such as sawing a square corner or drawing a straight line.\nFa are objective, reliable, and easy to use, so that with\nminimal training anyone can employ them to perform a task or check the\nresults. Fa alone do not ensure success, nor do they erase\nthe distinction between the skilled and unskilled \u2014 or between\nthe virtuous and those still acquiring virtue \u2014 but for most of\nus they at least ensure that we will do better than we would without\nthem.\n\n\nOur primary task in governing or \u201cordering\u201d (zhi)\nsociety, then, is to find reliable, objective models or standards to\nguide our actions, practices, and policies. As in the case of the\nli (ritual), however, the Mohists point out that any standard\nspecific to our particular family, education, or community could turn\nout to be unreliable. \u201cModels and Standards,\u201d the text\ncited above, continues:\nThat being so, then what is acceptable to take as a model\n(fa) for order (zhi)? How would it be for everyone to\nmodel themselves on their parents? Those in the world who are parents\nare many, but those who are benevolent (ren) are few; if\nall model themselves on their parents, this is modeling\nthe unbenevolent. Modeling on the unbenevolent \u2014 it\u2019s not acceptable to\ntake that as a model.\n\n\nHaving objected to taking parents as a fundamental moral model, the\npassage next rejects teachers (or \u201clearning\u201d) and rulers on\nthe same grounds: We cannot be sure that all teachers and political\nleaders are benevolent (ren). The text concludes that\n\u201cof these three, parents, teachers, and rulers, none is\nacceptable as a model for order.\u201d An objective standard is\nneeded, one that is not morally fallible in the way that any\nparticular individual role model or cultural tradition might be. The\nMohists propose that we can find such a standard by considering the\nattitudes of an ideally impartial, benevolent, and reliable moral\nagent: Tian (Heaven, nature, the sky), whom they revere as a\nquasi-personal god.\nThat being so, then what is acceptable to take as a model\nfor order? So I say, Nothing is like modeling on Heaven.  Heaven\u2019s\nconduct is broad and impartial; its favors are rich and incur no debt;\nits brightness endures without fading. So the sage-kings modeled\nthemselves on it. (Book 4, \u201cModels and\nStandards\u201d)\n\n\nThis notion of taking Heaven as a moral role model leads the Mohists\nto develop a credible normative theory based on equal, impartial\nconcern for the welfare of all. At the same time, however, it steers\nthem into formulating some of their central normative principles in a\npotentially problematic way. Their conception of Tian\n(Heaven) provides a compelling basis for arguing that everyone\u2019s\ninterests have equal moral worth. But since the Mohists believe\nthat Tian acts impartially on everyone\u2019s behalf, adopting it\nas a moral model tends to imply that each of us as individuals is\nobliged to treat others and ourselves equally \u2014 to act in\nothers\u2019 interest exactly as we act in our own. This view, if indeed\nthe Mohists hold it, would invite several objections commonly leveled\nat crude forms of utilitarianism. The most obvious is that\nlimitations on our time and resources make it practically impossible\nfor us to act equally on others\u2019 behalf as well as our\nown. (In practice, I cannot possibly make breakfast for everyone each\nmorning, only for myself, my family, and perhaps a few neighbors.)\nAnother possible objection would be that by demanding excessive\nattention to the needs of others, Mohist ethics leaves individuals\nwith insufficient resources to live their own lives well, thus\nsacrificing much of what makes an individual life good.\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 ethical theory thus raises fundamental questions\nconcerning the moral claim on us of others\u2019 interests, the role of\nimpartiality, fairness, and benevolence in an adequate ethical code,\nand the elements of a good life \u2014 questions that remain vital in\nmoral philosophy today. We will return to some of these issues and the\nMohists\u2019 response to them when we assess the Mohist ethical theory\nbelow. First, however, we need to explore further the concept of a\n\u201cmodel\u201d presupposed by Mohists\u2019 notion of \u201ctaking Heaven as a\nmodel.\u201d\nThe Concept of Fa (Models)\n\n\nThe Mohists refer to the objective ethical standard they seek as a\nfa (model, standard), a concept that plays a central part in\ntheir ethics and their views on language, knowledge, and argumentation\nor reasoning. Fa is among the key notions through which Mohism\nhad an important influence on the late Warring States Confucian thinker\nXunzi and his student Han Fei, leading representative of a style of\nrealpolitik thought that later became known as the fa jia\n(school of fa, often translated as \u201clegalism\u201d). Fa\nhave a dual role, providing both practical guidelines and justificatory\ncriteria for judgment and action. In their action-guiding role,\nfa serve as guidelines or decision criteria that direct action\nand practical reasoning. In this respect, they are an important part of\nthe Mohists\u2019 explanation of how we learn language and ethical norms and\nof the cognitive processes by which we reason, form judgments, and act.\nIn their justificatory role, on the other hand, fa may\nfunction as fundamental standards of correctness by which to justify\nactions and judgments.\n\n\nA notable feature of \u201cModels and Standards,\u201d the Mohist text\ndiscussed in the preceding section, is that the candidate fa\nconsidered are not ethical principles, but virtuous agents, such as\nparents and teachers, whom we can take as role models. This observation\nprovides a key to understanding both the concept of fa and,\nmore broadly, the orientation of Mohist views about language,\nknowledge, cognition, and reasoning.\n\n\nThe term fa denotes any guide, aid, or tool for following a\nnorm or making a judgment. Explicit rules, laws, and definitions are\nall fa. But fa may also be role models, such as a\nvirtuous parent, teacher, or ruler. They may be prototypes, exemplars,\nanalogies, or pictures of some kind of thing, or they may be tools or\nmeasuring devices, such as a yardstick or a carpenter\u2019s compass and set square. They may even be concepts, such as \u201cthe benefit\n(l\u00ec) of the world,\u201d which the Mohists take to be\nco-extensive with and thus a criterion for identifying what is\nyi (morally righteous). In short, any criterion or paradigm that\nhelps us to make correct judgments or to act correctly can be a\nfa.\n\n\nThe reason such a wide range of items can serve as fa is\nthat the Mohists regard fa primarily not as principles or\nrules, but as different types of practical models used to guide the\nperformance of norm-governed activities. The objective ethical\nstandards they seek are not definitions or universal principles, from\nwhich they will derive particular consequences by deductive reasoning.\nInstead, they seek a reliable role model or paradigm for their actions and practices to copy or emulate. This is why they can propose,\nas their highest fa or ethical standard, not a normative\nprinciple, but Heaven itself, considered as the highest, most reliable\nmoral agent in the natural order.\n\n\nThe prominence of practical models or exemplars reflects two\nfundamental features of Mohist thought and arguably of classical\nChinese philosophy generally. The first is its practical, pragmatic\norientation. The focus of early Chinese thought is on correct practical\nperformance, not theoretical description or representation. The concept\nthat stands at the center of the classical discourse is dao\n(way), a notion that refers to norms, patterns, and methods of\nacting, specifically of ordering the state and conducting\none\u2019s personal life. The central questions for early Chinese\nthinkers are not What is the truth, and how do we know it? but What is\nthe dao (way), and how do we follow\n it?[6]\n The fundamental aim is not an intellectual grasp of a definition or\nprinciple, but the practical ability to follow a norm or perform a\ntask successfully.  Fa are in effect tools to aid us in\nfollowing the dao, and anything that guides practical\nperformance effectively can serve as a fa. A concrete\nexemplar or model that one can emulate is considered as useful as a\nprinciple or definition (indeed, principles and definitions are\napparently seen as one variety of practical model).\n\n\nThe second, interrelated feature is that the Mohists regard\ncognition, judgment, and inference as processes of analogical pattern recognition\n\u2014 specifically, processes of distinguishing relevantly similar kinds\nof objects, events, or actions from dissimilar\n ones.[7]\n This sort of process is referred to as distinguishing (bian)\nwhat is \u201cthis\u201d (shi) from what is \u201cnot\u201d\n(fei). (Shi and fei are pronounced roughly\n\u201cshr\u201d and \u201cfey.\u201d) Drawing such distinctions is a practical skill, the\nexecution of which can be aided by reference to models or exemplars \u2014\nthat is, fa.  Fa are in effect reference prototypes\nfor use in pattern recognition.\n\n\nBoth of these features are illustrated by how the Mohists describe\nthe application of fa. The following passage explains the role\nof \u201cHeaven\u2019s intent\u201d as an ethical fa by likening it to the\ncompass, a model against which the wheelwright compares objects to\ndistinguish whether they are round or not.\nThus our Master Mozi\u2019s having Heaven\u2019s intent, to give an\nanalogy, is no different from the wheelwright\u2019s having a compass or\nthe carpenter\u2019s having a set square. Now the wheelwright grasps his\ncompass and uses it to measure the round and not round in the world,\nsaying, \u201cWhat conforms to my compass, call it\n\u2018round,\u2019 what doesn\u2019t conform to my compass, call it\n\u2018not round.\u2019\u201d Hence round and not round can both be\nknown. What is the reason for this?  It\u2019s that the fa for\n\u201cround\u201d is clear. (Book 27, \u201cHeaven\u2019s\nIntent\u201d)\n\n\nFormally, ethical fa are not regarded as general principles\nthat we apply as the major premise of a kind of deductive argument,\nsuch as a practical syllogism. Rather, they are seen as paradigms or\nprototypes against which we compare something to distinguish, or\nbian, whether or not it falls under the extension of a term,\nsuch as \u2018yi\u2019 (duty, righteousness). Drawing distinctions\nin this way is the functional equivalent, in Mohist thought, of making\na judgment or forming a belief. The ability to draw the distinctions\ncorrectly is knowledge. Moreover, the process of citing a fa,\ncomparing something to it, and then judging whether the two are similar\nconstitutes the Mohists\u2019 basic conception of practical reasoning. Since\nfor the Mohists fa include rules as well as models and\nexamples, in their eyes the process of deducing a conclusion from a\ngeneral rule or principle is in effect a special case of the more\ngeneral cognitive process of comparing things to models and drawing\ndistinctions. Thus they tend to explain all forms of reasoning,\nincluding deductive inference, as species of pattern recognition or\nanalogical reasoning.\n\n\nBecause they play such a central role in the Mohist conception of\ncognition and reasoning, fa can be treated as a key to\nunderstanding the Mohists\u2019 approach not only to ethics, but to\nepistemology, semantics, and logic or argumentation. Action, linguistic\ncommunication, knowledge, and reasoning are all explained by appeal to\nthe practical activity of drawing distinctions according to public\nnorms. Fa are models or standards that aid us in following\nsuch norms reliably. In ethics, they take the place of universal\nethical principles in moral reasoning and in guiding action. In\nepistemology, they are public criteria that guide distinction drawing\nand thus justify claims to knowledge. In semantic theory, they are part\nof the explanation of why words refer to what they do: a word is\nassociated with a fa (exemplar) by convention and then refers\nto everything deemed relevantly similar to the fa. In\nreasoning or argument, a judgment is established or refuted by citing\none or more fa and showing that the object of the judgment\ndoes or does not conform to the fa.\n",
