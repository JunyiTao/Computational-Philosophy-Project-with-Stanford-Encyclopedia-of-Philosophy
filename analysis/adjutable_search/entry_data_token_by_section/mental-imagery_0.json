    "main_text": "What is mental imagery?\n1. What is mental imagery?\n\nClose your eyes and visualize an apple. Many readers will have a\nquasi-perceptual experience that may be a bit similar to actually\nseeing an apple. For those who do, this experience is an example of\nmental imagery \u2013 in fact, it is the kind of example philosophers\nuse to introduce the concept.\n\nIt is not clear whether introducing the term \u2018mental\nimagery\u2019 by example is particularly helpful, for at least two\nreasons. First, there are well-demonstrated interpersonal variations\nin mental imagery (see Section 1.2), so much so that some people\nreport no experience whatsoever when closing their eyes and\nvisualizing an apple. Second, it is unclear how such an example like\nvisualizing an apple could be generalized in a way that would give us\na coherent concept. It does not seem like mental imagery is an\nordinary language term \u2013 it was introduced at the end of the\n19th century (see Section 1.1 below) as a technical term in\npsychology and no languages other than English has a term that would\nmean mental imagery (as distinct from \u2018imagination\u2019 or\n\u2018mental picture\u2019). But if \u2018mental imagery\u2019 is\nindeed a technical term, then it is supposed to be used in a way that\nmaximizes theoretical usefulness. In this case, theoretical usefulness\nmeans that we should use \u2018mental imagery\u2019 in a way that\nwould help us to explain how the mind works.\n\nThis encyclopedia entry will not attempt to give an ordinary language\nanalysis of the term \u2018mental imagery\u2019, partly because it\nis far from clear that \u2018mental imagery\u2019 is part of the\nordinary language. Instead, the focus will be on the theoretically\nuseful concept of mental imagery as it is used for explaining various\nmental phenomena in psychology, neuroscience and philosophy.\n",
