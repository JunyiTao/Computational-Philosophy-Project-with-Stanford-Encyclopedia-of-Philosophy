Everyday Aesthetic Qualities\n\nHowever, questions can be raised as to whether qualities such as\nmessiness and clutter belong to aesthetics discourse. Appreciation of\nmore typical aesthetic qualities, such as beauty, sublimity, elegance,\ngrace, artistic excellence, powerful expression, and the like, is\nthought to require a certain degree of aesthetic sensibility or\n\u2018taste\u2019 that needs to be cultivated. Moreover, their\nappreciation often demands a certain conceptual understanding of\nthings, such as the object\u2019s historical and cultural context,\nthe artist\u2019s oeuvre, and some basic information regarding\nnature, among others. Aesthetic experience, after all, is expected to\npromote a dialogical process between the experiencing agent and the\nobject, thereby widening and deepening one\u2019s sensuous,\nemotional, imaginative, and intellectual capacity. Sometimes\ncharacterized as Bildung, it should be an educational and\nempowering experience.\n\nIn comparison, the detection of the everyday aesthetic qualities in\nquestion, such as messiness, shabbiness, cuteness, and prettiness,\nseems to result from an almost knee-jerk reaction without any\nbackground knowledge, aesthetic sophistication or reflective process,\nand, as such, does not make a worthy subject matter for\naesthetics.\n\nTwo responses have been given to this challenge. First, even if some\nqualities can be experienced without the same kind and degree of\naesthetic sensibility or sophistication required for art appreciation,\nthis alone does not render them outside the realm of aesthetics. Even\na seemingly unreflective response to qualities \u2013 such as dirty,\nmessy, and disorganized \u2013 is not free of a cultural and\ncontextual framework (Douglas 2002; Saito 2007). Second, it is\npossible to provide a kind of sliding scale with one end requiring\nutmost sensibility often obtained after extensive education and\npractice, such as the ability to appreciate twelve-tone music,\nJoyce\u2019s novels, Japanese Noh theater, and bogs, and the other\nend requiring very little education and practice, such as Norman\nRockwell paintings, a military march, a sparkling jewelry piece, and a\ncolorful flower garden. Some aesthetic qualities can be considered\n\u2018major league\u2019 or heavy-weight while other aesthetic\nqualities are \u2018minor league\u2019 or light-weight, without\ndisqualifying the latter from the realm of the aesthetic altogether.\nAfter all, they refer to our qualitative response to the sensory\nexperience of the objects and phenomena and some experiences are more\nintense and profound than others without thereby denying the aesthetic\ndimension of more simple and easy experiences (Leddy 1995, 1997,\n2012a, 2012b; Harris 2000; Ngai 2012; Postrel 2013; Mollar 2014).\n\nIf minor league aesthetic qualities lack sophistication and profundity\ncompared to major league aesthetic qualities, a case can be made that\nthey make up for this lack by their pervasiveness in daily life with\nserious consequences. While we do experience beauty and sublimity in\nour daily life, such occasions are rather rare. More often than not,\nin our everyday life, we judge things for being pretty, nice,\ninteresting, cute, sweet, adorable, boring, plain, drab, dowdy,\nshabby, gaudy, ostentatious, and the like. It is particularly\nimportant to attend to these qualities because, due to their\nprevalence and relatively easy recognition, they exert a powerful\ninfluence on our decisions and actions regarding mundane matters.\nIndeed, strategies in advertising, political campaigning, and\npropaganda often make use of these qualities to direct people\u2019s\nbehavior (Postrel 2003; Mandoki 2007; Saito 2007, 2017a, 2018b;\nSartwell 2010). Those who are concerned with both the prevalence and\nuncritical acceptance of aestheticization of life argue for a more\nactive, engaged, reflective mode of perception instead of passively\nexperiencing and being affected by aestheticization ploys, thereby\ncultivating aesthetic literacy and vigilance (Vihalem 2016; Matteucci\n2017; Potgieter 2017).\n\nAnother worry has been raised about the aesthetic worthiness, or\n\u201caesthetic credentials,\u201d of some experiences (Dowling\n2010). It concerns the purely bodily-oriented responses such as the\nsensation of scratching an itch, receiving a massage, drinking tea, or\nsmelling fishy odor (Irvin 2008a,b). There is a concern that they are\ntoo private and subjective to allow any inter-subjective discussion\nand critical discourse, resulting in subjective relativism and\ncompromising the possibility of  sensus communis.\nKant\u2019s distinction between the beautiful and the merely\nagreeable is often invoked to support this criticism (Parsons and\nCarlson 2008; Soucek 2009; Dowling 2010).\n\nIn response, some thinkers point out that it is a mistake to treat\nthese bodily sensations as an isolated, singular sensory experience.\nAccording to them, in ordinary life, we almost never have an\nexperience of smell, taste, or touch by itself. Instead, our\nexperiences are usually multi-sensory or synaesthetic and take place\nin a specific context (Howes 2005; Howes and Classen 2014). Scratching\nan itch can be a part of experiencing a mosquito-infested bog, or\nexperienced as an annoyance caused by the stiff fabric label sewn on\nthe inside of a new shirt collar. The taste of tea cannot be separated\nfrom its aroma, visual appearance, and the tactile sensations of\ntexture and warmth as one holds the mug and presses the lip against\nits rim. All of these sensory experiences take place in a certain\nsurrounding and situation with its own ambiance, as well as within the\nspecific flow of one\u2019s daily life. One may grab a cup of tea on\nthe run and gulp it down to get the caffeine kick as one rushes to a\nmeeting, or savor each sip as one sits in front of a fireplace\nrelaxing, or participate in the Japanese tea ceremony. Even if the tea\nitself were to remain the same, the experience surrounding its\ningestion changes, sometimes even affecting our experience of the\ntaste of tea itself (Irvin 2009a; Melchionne 2011, 2014; Perullo 2016;\nSaito 2017a). Thus, purely bodily sensation can be folded into the\natmosphere or ambiance constituted by many ingredients. Then what we\nappreciate is not merely a singular bodily sensation in isolation such\nas the tactile sensation or smell but the fittingness or, one may even\nsay, Kantian \u2018purposiveness,\u2019 or lack thereof, created by\nthe relationship between and among factors making up the\natmosphere.\n\nPresumed subjective relativism regarding a purely bodily sensation,\ntherefore, can be mitigated at least to a certain extent if it is\nregarded as one of the many ingredients that make up a larger whole\npermeated by a unified atmosphere, such as a sense of well-being,\ncontentment, comfort, or negatively, a sense of isolation, discomfort,\nuneasiness, or anxiety. Such an appreciation (or depreciation) allows\nsome degree of inter-subjective communication and sharing; indeed many\nliterary narratives provide a rich reservoir of such experiences.\n",
