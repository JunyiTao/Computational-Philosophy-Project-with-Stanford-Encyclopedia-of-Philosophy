    "main_text": "\n\nPolitical theorists propose standards that identify legitimate uses of\npolitical power. Some adopt a principle of public\njustification. A public justification is a kind of rationale for\nexercising power and control. It is public because the rationale, or\ngroup of rationales, is one that members of the public can accept. Put\nanother way, to treat people as equals, we must ensure that political\npower is justified for or to them by their own\nlights, so a public justification thus consists of reasons the public\ncan recognize as valid. Those who adopt a public justification\nstandard are often called public reason liberals. Liberal\ninstitutions (freedom of speech, the rule of law, democracy) are\npublicly justified, but illiberal institutions are not. Diverse\nperspectives within the public will reject non-liberal\ninstitutions.\n\nCoercion is the standard object of public justification because it is\nperhaps the characteristic feature of political life. Charles Larmore\nremarks that public justification has \u201cto do with the sort of\nrespect we owe one another in the political realm \u2014 that is, in\nrelationships where the possibility of coercion is involved\u201d\n(Larmore 2008, 86). John Rawls\u2019s principle of public\njustification holds that political power requires justification (Rawls\n2005, 12) because \u201cpolitical power is always coercive\npower\u201d (Rawls 2005, 68). Jonathan Quong holds that public\njustification concerns the imposition of coercive laws (Quong 2011,\n233\u2013250). And, as Christopher Eberle puts it (2002, 54),\n\u201cthe clarion call of justificatory liberalism is the public\njustification of coercion.\u201d Some have wondered whether\nnon-coercive state actions need public justification (2.7). But they\nnonetheless agree that coercion generally, if not always, requires\nit.\n\nThe idea of a public justification is, at its root, an idea about\nwhich reasons justify coercion. Public justification is not a\nprocess of exchanging reasons. Instead, the exchange of\nreasons can uncover or generate a public justification. Or we could\narrive at a public justification through a non-deliberative route.\nExamples include bargaining processes and adjudicative procedures. In\nthis way, the ideas of public reason and public justification are\ndistinct. Public justifications might consist of public reasons. But a\nreason shared by the public might fall short of a sound justification\nif other reasons undercut or override it. One might, for example,\nsupport a new anti-poverty program on shared grounds of justice for\nthe poor. However, alternative programs reduce poverty more\neffectively. The original poverty program could be publicly justified\nbased on a shared commitment to justice, but other shared reasons,\nlike policy efficacy, can undercut the public justification for the\nprogram.\n\nRawls was the foremost advocate of the idea of public justification.\nBut we find the idea stressed in the works of J\u00fcrgen Habermas,\nDavid Gauthier, Gerald Gaus, Stephen Macedo, Charles Larmore, Seyla\nBenhabib, and many others.\n\nThere is considerable disagreement about how to understand the idea.\nSome theorists hold that all public justifications consist of shared\nor accessible reasons. These are often called consensus\ntheorists. Others allow diverse, unshared reasons to figure into\npublic justifications. These are often called convergence\ntheorists. (See\n Section 2.3\n below). Public justification theorists also disagree about how to\nattribute reasons to citizens. This disagreement is about the right\nlevel of idealization. Idealization involves modeling someone\nas having improved information and cognitive capacities. The goal is\nto identify which reasons apply to her, even if she cannot or will not\nsee them as such in her ordinary life. Some theorists adopt more\nradical idealizations than others.\n\nThis entry addresses disputes about public justification by\narticulating an open-ended principle. This Public Justification\nPrinciple (PJP) helps classify competing conceptions of public\njustification.\n\nThe entry first situates public justification in the history of\npolitical philosophy. The PJP is then stated and explained, along with\nits chief variables. Variables include conceptions of reasons,\nidealization, processes of public justification, and others. The entry\nthen examines the arguments on behalf of the principle; different\nfoundations for the PJP are then discussed. The entry also addresses\nconcepts of political stability and publicity related to public\njustification. And then, it reviews various objections to the PJP. The\nentry concludes by discussing how theorists apply public justification\nto specific controversies.\n",
