According to\nAdvaita Ved\u0101ntins, the Upani\u1e63ads reveal a fundamental\nprinciple of nonduality termed \u201cbrahman,\u201d which\nis the reality of all things. Advaitins understand brahman as\ntranscending individuality and empirical plurality. They seek to\nestablish that the essential core of one\u2019s self\n(\u0101tman) is brahman. The fundamental thrust of\nAdvaita Ved\u0101nta is that the \u0101tman is pure\nnon-intentional consciousness. It is one without a second, nondual,\ninfinite existence, and numerically identical with brahman.\nThis effort entails tying a metaphysics of brahman to a\nphilosophy of consciousness.\n\nThis philosophical tradition finds its most sustained early\narticulation in the works of the preeminent Advaita Ved\u0101ntin,\n\u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya (hereafter \u015aa\u1e45kara), who\nflourished during the eighth century CE. \u015aa\u1e45kara endeavored\nto communicate nonduality through systematized theories of\nmetaphysics, language, and epistemology. He also incorporated specific\nmethods of philosophical teaching, along with learning methods of\nlistening, reflection, and contemplation. His philosophy and methods\ncomprise a teaching tradition intended to culminate in a direct\nliberating recognition of nonduality that is synonymous with\nliberation or freedom (mok\u1e63a). \u015aa\u1e45kara is\none of the most widely known and influential Indian philosophers from\nthe classical period, and the most authoritative philosopher of\nAdvaita Ved\u0101nta. He is revered by Advaita Ved\u0101nta\u2019s\nteaching tradition and monastic lineages, and continues to influence\nvirtually all contemporary lineages today.

Life and Works\n\nThere are several different dates ascribed to \u015aa\u1e45kara.\nEarly scholars placed him from 788\u2013820 CE. Nakamura (1983:\n48\u201388) argues for an earlier date of 700\u2013750 CE, and\ndiscusses the various dating theories at length. Potter (1981:\n14\u201315, 116\u2013119) places him from the late seventh to early\neighth centuries CE due to the dating of a contemporaneous Advaitin\nnamed Ma\u1e47\u1e0danami\u015bra (see Thrasher 1979 on\nMa\u1e47\u1e0danami\u015bra\u2019s dating). There are no dependable\nhistorical records of \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s life beyond his\nwritten works which provide few biographical clues. Scholars are also\nnot clear about his religious identity. According to the Advaita\nVed\u0101nta tradition itself, he was \u015aaiva (a devotee of the\ndeity \u015aiva); but several scholars believe he was\nVai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a devotee of the deity Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (see\nClark 2006: 159\u2013170 for an overview of these theories).\nHagiographical accounts of his life, the\n\u015aa\u1e45karavijayas (Conquests of\n\u015aa\u1e45kara), were composed several centuries after his\ndeath. They describe him as being born in Kal\u0101\u1e0di, located\nin modern day Kerala. He became a renouncer at a young age, left his\nfamily to pursue liberation, and spent his life travelling around the\nsub-continent while teaching his pupils, engaging in philosophical\ndebate, and composing his works. He supposedly died at the young age\nof thirty-two. (See Bader 2000 for a discussion of\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s life according to his hagiographies).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara was a systematizer of Advaita Ved\u0101nta, not a\nfounder. He viewed himself as part of a long lineage of teachers.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s teacher was named Govinda; and according to\ntradition, Govinda\u2019s teacher was Gau\u1e0dap\u0101da (sixth\ncentury CE), who composed the\nGau\u1e0dap\u0101dak\u0101rik\u0101s (Verses of\nGau\u1e0dap\u0101da) on the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya\nUpani\u1e63ad. The historical record of Advaita Ved\u0101nta is\nobscure prior to Gau\u1e0dap\u0101da (see Nakamura 2004 for his\nextensive work on pre-\u015aa\u1e45kara Ved\u0101ntins). Advaita\nVed\u0101ntins trace their lineage back through\nB\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a (ca. first century BCE), who authored the\nBrahmas\u016btras (The Aphorisms on Brahman), to the\nindividuals in Upani\u1e63adic narratives, and ultimately to\n\u012b\u015bvara (roughly \u201cGod\u201d) as\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a or the teaching form of\n\u015aiva known as Dak\u1e63in\u0101m\u016brti. By this lineage they\nclaim the authority of Upani\u1e63adic teachers,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and B\u0101dar\u0101yana as their own. The\ncorresponding texts of the Upani\u1e63ads,\nBhagavadg\u012bt\u0101, and Brahmas\u016btras\nconstitute Advaita Ved\u0101nta\u2019s triple canon\n(prasth\u0101natray\u012b).\n\nFrom a historical standpoint, \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s textual works\ndefine his identity. He composed our earliest complete extant\ncommentaries on the Brahmas\u016btras,\nBhagavadg\u012bt\u0101, and the ten principal Upani\u1e63ads\nconsisting of the \u012a\u1e63\u0101, Kena,\nKa\u1e6dha, Pra\u1e63na,\nMu\u1e47\u1e0daka, M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya,\nAitareya, Taittir\u012bya, Ch\u0101ndogya,\nand B\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upanisads.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s commentary on the\nM\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dukya is part of his extensive commentary\non the Gau\u1e0dap\u0101dak\u0101rik\u0101s\u2019\nexplanation of the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara also composed an independent work titled the\nUpade\u015bas\u0101hasr\u012b (A Thousand\nTeachings). There are hundreds of other texts attributed to\n\u015aa\u1e45kara, but their authorship is questionable and most were\nlikely composed in later centuries by monastic heads who held a\n\u201c\u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya\u201d title. (See Potter\n1981: 115\u2013117; Hacker 1995; and Mayeda 1965a, 1965b, and 1967\nfor discussions of \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s likely works, as well as\nHacker\u2019s criteria for determining their authenticity. See\nSundaresan 2002 for some critiques and expansion of Hacker\u2019s\ncriteria).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara was an exegete, philosopher, and teacher. His\nprimary commitment was to establish his philosophy of nondual\nbrahman as the subject matter of the Upani\u1e63ads, and to\nsystematize Advaita exegesis by harmonizing the diverse and\npotentially contradictory passages between Upani\u1e63adic texts. One\nmust note however, that \u015aa\u1e45kara does not attempt to prove\nnonduality solely through independent reasoning. Such an endeavor is\nnot possible in his opinion because nonduality is not subject to\nlogical proofs (see Murty 1959 on the role of reason for\n\u015aa\u1e45kara). He accepts nonduality based on the\nUpani\u1e63ad\u2019s authority alone. Nonetheless, he was an\noriginal philosopher who constructed novel arguments to make sense of\nthe Upani\u1e63ads, defend his positions, and critique his\nphilosophical adversaries. \u015aa\u1e45kara also shaped a\npedagogical method to approach texts as a means of knowledge. At the\nsame time, he left several open questions and ambiguities in his\nwriting, in part due to the different source texts of his commentaries\nand the voluminous amount of his work. This has led to different\ninterpretations and several intra-Advaitin philosophical disputes in\nthe post-\u015aa\u1e45kara tradition (see Potter 2012).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara purportedly established the earliest monastic\nsystem in Brahmanical religion, including the Da\u015ban\u0101m\u012b\n(Ten Names) renouncer orders (see Clark 2006 on these orders) as well\nas four or five principle monasteries (ma\u1e6dhas) across\nthe subcontinent (see Cenkner 1983 on ma\u1e6dhas). Many\n\u015aa\u1e45kara-identifying lineages, along with the principle\nmonasteries, and several smaller monasteries, hermitages, and learning\ninstitutions continue to flourish today in the living Advaita\nVed\u0101nta tradition. An unbroken lineage beginning with\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s direct disciples, such as Padmap\u0101da\nand Sure\u015bvara, continued to develop, defend, and expand upon his\nphilosophy into the modern period. At present,\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s Advaita Ved\u0101nta extends far beyond its\northodox cultural and geographical confines. Its streams of thought\ncontinue to evolve due to the encounter with different philosophical,\ntheological, and socio-political contexts; yet the tradition as a\nwhole demonstrates a significant degree of philosophical continuity\nfrom past to present.\n2. Metaphysics\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s metaphysical arguments defend\nUpani\u1e63adic propositions claiming that existence is \u201cone\nonly, without a second\u201d (ChU 6.2.1). He follows the general\nUpani\u1e63adic model that all known objects are compounded\npermutations of a set of primary elements. This is modeled as\nthreefold, consisting of fire, water, and earth (ChU 6.2.3); or as\nfive-fold, consisting of space, air, fire, water, and earth (TaiU\n2.1.1; see BrS\u016bBh 2.3.1\u201312 for reconciling these two\ndifferent models). The elements emerge successively from\nundifferentiated existence, at first in subtle (i.e., non-perceptible)\nform. They then undergo a process of division and recombination, so\nthat each element includes portions of the others, to evolve into the\ncoarse (i.e., perceptible) \u201cgreat elements\u201d\n(mah\u0101bh\u016btas). Perceptual objects are in fact\nderivative products that lack existence independent of these primary\nelements. These elements, however, do not constitute an elemental\nfoundationalism, nor do they bottom out in an atomic foundationalism,\nbecause they are ultimately ontologically dependent on something else,\nnamely pure existence (brahman) (BrS\u016bBh\n2.2.15\u201317). Brahman is the nondual ground underlying\nall objects, the single foundation (adhi\u1e63\u1e6dhana)\non which the entire universe depends. All objects point back to this\nindependent ground and possess no existence apart from it.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara argues that this foundational existence has no\ndependence on a second thing. It is self-established, irreducible,\nimmutable, and free of space, time, and causation.\n\nAccording to \u015aa\u1e45kara, a corollary of his position on\nnondual existence is that the world we perceive is less-than-real or\nillusory in some way in comparison to its ground. Though objects exist\nwithin existence, their forms are merely concepts that we represent\nwith names (see BrS\u016bBh 2.1.14 and ChUBh 6.1.4). They are\ncognitive constructions; however, in \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s view\nthis construction is an epistemic error of attributing independent\nreality to objects, not an ontological subjective idealism of\nindividuals mentally projecting the world. His commentary on BrS\u016b\n2.2.28\u201331, for example, affirms that we must assume perceptual\nrealism and rejects Buddhist Yog\u0101c\u0101ra idealism. By knowing\nnondual existence, one knows the reality of all things in the\nuniverse, and recognizes their forms as merely names. The immediate\nepistemic recognition of one\u2019s consciousness as numerically\nidentical with this ground of nondual existence is\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s philosophical goal. This recognition is\nsynonymous with liberation (mok\u1e63a), and entails an\nabsolute metaphysical wholeness by which the individual\u2019s mind\nis freed from psychological suffering.\n2.1 Existence, Reality, and Causation\n\nThroughout his commentaries \u015aa\u1e45kara employs two related\ncriteria, dependence and persistence, to determine what is real. He\ndefines the real as that which does not change its nature, whereas\nwhat is unreal does change (see, e.g., GKBh 2.6; TaiUBh 2.1.1). The\nprimary distinction here is change. Something which persists is more\nreal than what is transient because what is transient is subject to\nnegation. His canonical illustration is a clay pot. One may shape a\nsubstantial cause such as clay into new names and forms, from a lump\nto a pot to a plate. With each new form, the former is destroyed, yet\nthe clay continues through each. This example illustrates his\nfoundational discriminative reasoning of continuity and discontinuity,\nwhich determines the relationship of what persists and what does not\npersist between two things (see\n \u00a74.3\n below). Accordingly, the clay persisting through causation is\nrelatively more real than the non-persisting lump, pot, and plate\nforms, because clay is not negatable. In this illustration, clay is\nanalogous to brahman, the underlying existence of the\nuniverse, and the pot is analogous to objects.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara also incorporates the persistence argument to show\nthat one term (clay) is independent of another (pot)\u2014clay is\nmore real based on independence in causation. The pot form arises out\nof the clay cause, is sustained by clay, and resolves back into clay\nupon its destruction. The pot depends on clay for its being. Its form\nand mass possess no objective existence apart from its clay substance.\nTherefore, the clay is more real based on a hierarchy of dependency.\nThis hierarchical relationship reveals an asymmetrical\ndependence\u2014pot form depends upon clay substance for its being,\nbut clay substance does not depend on the particular pot form.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara draws several important conclusions from this:\n\nthe metaphysical ground possesses more reality than the grounded\neffect;\nthe effect is wholly reducible to its causal ground; and\ntherefore the effect is not different than its ground.\n\n\n(See ChUBh ch. 6 and BrS\u016bBh 2.1.15\u201320 for\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s understanding of cause and effect; see\nPotter 1981: 65\u20137 for a summary of his views on causality).\n\nEverything in the universe undergoes constant change; however,\naccording to \u015aa\u1e45kara, objects cannot simply come into being\nand go out of being. They must depend on something else, some existent\ncause, for their being. \u015aa\u1e45kara argues that prior to\nuniverse emergence, when all objects, time, and space, are unmanifest,\nonly primordial undifferentiated existence exists (see ChUBh\n6.2.1\u20132 for example). This existence is a single potential cause\nfree of form; but even after the universe emerges, there is still just\nthat single cause. It persists through all objects and causation, like\nthe clay persists through its changing forms. He concludes that every\nobject, including the universe itself, is a temporal artifact, simply\na name (n\u0101ma) and form (r\u016bpa). The entire\nuniverse is not different from brahman, and its form is less\nreal than brahman. All forms are less real than existence\nitself. Foundational existence is transitive, lending existence to\nobjects, like the clay to each of its forms. Furthermore, the\nrelationship is asymmetrical\u2014pure undifferentiated existence\ndoes not depend on objects, but objects depend on existence. Objects\nborrow their existence from this metaphysical ground and lack any\nindependent being apart from it. They are not different than their\ncause, and therefore their names and forms are only provisionally real\nappearances.\n\nIn considering \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s position, it is questionable\nwhere to locate the given existence possessed by objects in everyday\npropositions like, \u201cthis pot exists\u201d, \u201cthis seed\nis\u201d, or \u201cthe shirt is\u201d. How would one isolate the\nobject\u2019s existence within its particular form? For\n\u015aa\u1e45kara, this question is misguided and unanswerable\nbecause form does not delimit existence. When one encounters a form\nand seeks its existence in the locus of its substantial cause, one\nencounters another form that decomposes into further forms. For\nexample, the existence of a shirt depends on its causal cloth\nsubstance; however, cloth existence depends on threads, thread\nexistence depends on fibers, and fibers are composed of further subtle\ncauses, ad infinitum. Similarly, we may view the pot beyond\nthe boundaries of an illustration\u2014clay is the material cause of\nthe pot, but has further causes, like minerals and water, which\nthemselves depend on a descending chain of subtler causes.\n\nReductions of wholes to aggregates of parts, forms to further forms,\nproperties to other properties, effects to causes, or names to further\nnames are infinite. They never bottom out in a metaphysical\nfoundation. The proposition that an object\u2019s form delimits\nexistence crumbles because the regress defers an object\u2019s\nexistence to the next ontological level, an unending descent into\nsubtler causes or further mereological parts. Therefore, attempting to\nisolate stable independent existence as delimited by a given form is a\nreceding horizon. The form\u2019s existence is self-evident at each\npoint, but forever out of objective reach. \u015aa\u1e45kara argues\nthat this non-finding of existence in a form or as a form should not\nlead to positing the emergence of objects (e.g., properties, forms,\nwholes, etc.) from non-existence somewhere in the chain of dependency\n(a position he interprets as Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophy). Nor\nshould one conclude that if no unchanging ultimate essence can be\nobjectified, then everything must be empty of essential existence, and\ntherefore no metaphysical foundation ultimately exists (see ChUbh\n6.2.1\u20132). He considers this latter position, which he construes\nas the Madhyamika Buddhist, to be counter-intuitively nihilistic. It\nalso conflicts with his premises that existence is self-evident and\nthat it persists even as something evolves or devolves. Decomposition\nchains do not reveal any disruption of existence, only disruption of\nforms.\n\nThe philosophical upshot of \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s metaphysic is\nthat no form or object constitutes the fundamental ground of\nexistence. This explains why one cannot isolate existence itself\nthrough hierarchical descension or ascension in the realm of causation\nand objects. If this very effort is misguided, then the non-finding of\nexistence in an object does not entail an absolute absence of\nexistence, nor the object\u2019s emergence from non-existence. He\nrejects the presupposition that objects possess a property of\nexistence, or that the object delimits existence in spatial-temporal\nways. Existence is formless and nondual in reality. Therefore, in\nlight of \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s theory of causation, one cannot\nattribute independent reality to an object. Objects are divisible,\nderivative, dependent, and transient. They are merely names,\nnominalist wholes that lack any independent being. By negating the\nreality of their name and form one discovers that objects are in fact\nnumerically identical to formless existence. If this existence is not\nbound by space or time, which are also forms, it must be nondual. (See\n\u015aa\u1e45kara on BrS\u016b 2.1.15, ChU 6.2.2, and BhG 2.16 for\nfurther discussion of these points).\n2.2 The Appearance of the Universe\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s philosophy is perhaps most infamous for\nundermining the reality of the universe and its ultimate value. His\nphilosophical adversaries pejoratively labeled him a\nm\u0101y\u0101v\u0101din\u2014\u201cone who argues the\nworld is illusory (m\u0101y\u0101)\u201d. While this epithet\nis not exactly incorrect, it misrepresents his intention as centered\non world negation, and ignores the fact that he infrequently uses the\nterm \u201cm\u0101y\u0101\u201d (see Hacker 1995 on his use\nof this term). \u015aa\u1e45kara places great emphasis on moral\nvirtues and acting for the good of the world (see BhGBh ch.3 for\nexample and\n \u00a74.1\n below). Furthermore, the world is a pedagogical necessity as the\ninstrumental means to discover nonduality (on this, see Suthren Hirst\n2005). His goal is not to negate the axiological value of the world\nand intersubjective life (see Rambachan 2006 for a development of this\npoint). Rather, his focus is simply brahman. The world is a\ndependent effect of brahman and therefore not other than\nbrahman, and brahman is not a cosmogonic\nconstruction. This metaphysical view possesses epistemic value for\nliberation, along with is positive psychological byproducts such as\ncessation of suffering and the deepest happiness.\n\nGiven \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s absolute nonduality, how can he\nexplain the world\u2019s emergence in the first place? Later\nAdvaitins developed cosmogonic defenses to neutralize philosophical\nrivals, including theories of m\u0101y\u0101 as a creative\nmaterial cause equated with beginningless ignorance. Whether or not we\ncan accurately read such theories into \u015aa\u1e45kara is contested\nby academic and traditional scholars (see Comans 2000: 263\u20137;\nDoherty 2005; and Satchidanandendra 1964 [1989]). The more pertinent\npoint though is that \u015aa\u1e45kara does not require a definitive\ncosmogonic story of world causation for his philosophical goal of\nknowing brahman. He employs cosmologies as models that map\nthe empirical order in order to point back obliquely to nonduality as\nalready present as one\u2019s most primitive self-existence. These\nmodels may be dropped after serving their purpose (see, e.g., GKBh\n4.4.2; BrS\u016bBh 3.2.21, 2.1.27, and 4.3.14). Furthermore, an\nairtight philosophical causal account for a less-than-real world is\nnot possible. One strength of his position is a remarkable flexibility\nin accommodating contemporary scientific cosmologies. It is more\naccurate to read \u015aa\u1e45kara as ambivalent towards the world.\nHis approach is analogous to a dream character attempting to discover\nthe waking ground of their dreamscape. Analyzing the dream\u2019s\ncausation and illusoriness may be part of a method, but is not the\ngoal. The dream\u2019s illusoriness is only seen upon awakening and\nrecognizing the dream\u2019s waking foundation.\n\nStill, the empirical universe presents an ontological difficulty for\n\u015aa\u1e45kara because he is an epistemic realist. He accepts that\nexternal objects are not individual subjective illusions because we\nperceive these effects with intersubjective agreement. The world is\nthus independent of mind and not wholly unreal. One may therefore\nargue that he contradicts himself or falls into an excluded middle\n(see Fost 1998). The universe either exists or does not exist, is real\nor unreal, and cannot be both simultaneously. His solution is to argue\nfor a third ontological space\u2014that the universe is an objective\nbut less-than-real appearance. This appearance, akin to a magic trick,\nis m\u0101y\u0101. All objects are unreal in that they are\ntransient and dependent; yet are not non-existent like the horn of a\nhare or self-contradictory like a square circle. His understanding of\nwhat is unreal as a less-than-real appearance does not contradict what\nis real. The universe of names and forms holds a unique ontological\nposition as indeterminable (anirvacan\u012bya) as\nbrahman or something else other than brahman\n(BrS\u016bBh 2.1.14, 2.1.17; GK 2.34; see Comans 2000: 239\u2013246\non indeterminability). It is not identical to brahman (even\nthough reducible to brahman), but is not different\neither\u2014it does not constitute a second reality. One may thus\nview m\u0101y\u0101 as a postulate by elimination to account\nfor the world\u2019s ontological inexplicability, intended to direct\none toward the unity of reality. In \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s final\nphilosophical position, there is only brahman without parts,\nattributes, or causation.\n2.3 Two-Tiered Reality\n\nFor \u015aa\u1e45kara, the existence of the phenomenal empirical\nworld alongside that of nondual brahman is in fact an\nillusory false reality. They are one, not two. Yet the world\u2019s\nindeterminable appearance sets up a two-tiered (or two truths or two\norders) approach to reality: (1) The conventional intersubjective\nempirical reality (vy\u0101vah\u0101rikasatt\u0101) that\ncomprises the universe; and (2) the ultimate reality\n(p\u0101ram\u0101rthikasatt\u0101) of nondual existence that\nis brahman. This hierarchy of two orders and their\nasymmetrical relationship avoids their mutual contradiction. A\nconscientious reader must understand this distinction and be mindful\nthat \u015aa\u1e45kara toggles his perspective between the two. This\ndistinction is also foundational for comprehending his views on\nconsciousness and his philosophical methods intended to culminate in\nmok\u1e63a, more on which below.\n\nThe empirical order is a provisional ontology, whereas the ultimate\nreality is a final ontology. From the provisional empirical\nperspective, our universe is well founded like the pot is founded in\nclay. No object depends on itself, and its dependence is transitively\ndescending to the foundation of nondual existence. The\nuniverse\u2019s relationship with this ground is dependent and\nasymmetrical. This relationship collapses however at the ultimate\norder of nondual reality. For example, \u015aa\u1e45kara can\nprovisionally speak of the relationship of pot and clay (akin to the\nempirical standpoint); but from the perspective of cause and effect\nidentity, there is only clay (i.e., the absolute standpoint). The pot\nform is a mere property, not a substantive. Despite its name and\nfunction, \u015aa\u1e45kara does not ultimately attribute pot form to\nclay because it possesses no being apart from the clay substantive and\nis less real. Similarly, the order of ultimate reality is nondual\nexistence alone, with no second things like properties.\n\nOne cannot count two things, existence and object or existence and\nproperty, as equally existing across two orders of reality. Nor does\ncausation cross between two orders. In fact, from the ultimate\nperspective, the world (including the individual) is never truly born\nbecause nonduality is not subject to causation. It has no parts, is\nnot bound by time or space, and is changeless (BrS\u016bBh 2.1.14).\nSimilarly, the pot-space which appears to be delimited by the walls of\nthe pot does not delimit space itself\u2014it is never truly born\nfrom infinite space (GKBh 3.3\u20139). Therefore, the ultimate\nreality perspective excludes any dependence relations to make sense of\nmetaphysical grounding. (See GKBh 2.32\u201333, 3.3\u20139 for\ndiscussions of brahman as that which has no birth\n(aj\u0101ti) as the universe).\n\nThe clay-pot example falls short of adequately illustrating the two\norders of reality. \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s more apt illustration is\nour phenomenal worlds of waking and dreaming, by which he can pump the\nintuition that there is no objective causation between the two states.\nFor example, the dreamscape or an object like a dream clay-pot, is\nwell founded in the dreamer\u2019s cognition born of waking\nperceptual memory. This ontological dependence is asymmetrical. The\ndream pot depends on the memory of a waking pot cognition, but not\nvice versa; however, the dreamer cannot discover that causation solely\nfrom within the dream\u2019s objective reality no matter how hard\nthey reductively squeeze the dream pot. The dream pot\u2019s ground\nis in the waking state, and discovering that waking reality\nsimultaneously falsifies the dream world. After awakening, there is no\ndream to speak of, no level playing field for causation across the two\norders. Similarly, discovering the metaphysical ground of the\nempirical universe transitions to the ultimate reality of nondual\nexistence, in which there is no world of forms to question and no\nlevels of hierarchy remaining. (See Ram-Prasad 2002 on\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s use of the dream analogy).\n\nIn this way, even though \u015aa\u1e45kara assumes realism at the\nempirical level in terms of veridical cognition, he negates it\nmetaphysically from the absolute level. This leads him to a position\nof non-realism (Ram-Prasad 2002). From the empirical standpoint, these\ntwo orders seem to exist simultaneously and possess an asymmetrical\nrelationship\u2014the world is dependent upon brahman for\nits existence, yet brahman has no dependence on the world\neven though immanent in it. Only from the absolute standpoint does\nempirical reality collapse into brahman. The ultimate reality\nperspective metaphysically devours the world, all of its causation,\nand even its status as an appearance. From the nondual standpoint\nthere is only brahman. Brahman never undergoes\ngenuine transformation (pari\u1e47\u0101ma) into the world,\njust as a rope mistaken to be a snake does not actually transform into\na snake. Nor is the snake separate from the rope.\n2.4 \u012a\u015bvara (God)\n\nThough \u015aa\u1e45kara dismisses empirical reality from the\nmetaphysical standpoint of nonduality, the universe still possesses\nvalue in its identification with \u012b\u015bvara (usually\ntranslated as \u201cGod\u201d or \u201cLord\u201d for lack of a\nmore suitable English term). \u015aa\u1e45kara is ambiguous at times\nin differentiating \u012b\u015bvara from brahman,\nand uses several terms synonymously for both such as the\n\u201chighest lord\u201d (parame\u015bvara); but he\ngenerally distinguishes \u012bsvara as the lower\n(apara) brahman qualified with attributes (i.e., the\nuniverse), from the higher (apara) brahman that is\nabsolute nonduality (BrS\u016bBh 4.3.14). Following his readings of\nthe Upani\u1e63ads, \u015aa\u1e45kara identifies\n\u012b\u015bvara as both the material and intelligent causes\nof the universe (BrS\u016bBh 1.1.2). \u012a\u015bvara\nemanates the universe through a cosmic causal power\n(m\u0101y\u0101\u1e63akti), and is the very process of\nbecoming itself, a beginningless cycle of universe manifestation,\nsustenance, and dissolution. This process is an auto-cosmogony, making\n\u012b\u015bvara the material of the universe. As nothing but\n\u012b\u015bvara, the whole universe is sentient and\nself-aware. (See Ram-Prasad 2013; Comans 2000; Hacker 1995; and\nWarrier 1977 for further discussions of\n\u012b\u015bvara).\n\nFollowing his reading of the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya\nUpani\u1e63ad, \u015aa\u1e45kara likens the universe\u2019s\nunmanifest state to \u012b\u015bvara in a cosmic state of\ndeep dreamless sleep. Manifestation occurs when\n\u012b\u015bvara, as the intelligent cause, visualizes the\nuniverse through memory of past universes. This projective ontological\ncapacity of \u012b\u015bvara is analogous to an\nindividual\u2019s process of dreaming. Dreaming utilizes memory to\nproject a dream world that is not separate from one\u2019s mind\n(B\u1e5bUBh 4.3.10). The universe is similarly an effortless\nmanifestation of \u012b\u015bvara\u2019s knowledge, and\npossesses no existence apart from \u012b\u015bvara. The\nuniverse\u2019s ongoing manifestation is concurrent with\n\u012b\u015bvara\u2019s perception of it like the dreamscape\nis concurrent with the dreamer\u2019s perception. The\nuniverse\u2019s very existence depends on \u012b\u015bvara\nknowing it, for \u012b\u015bvara\u2019s knowing is its very\nprojection into objective existence.\n\nAs the material cause, \u012b\u015bvara takes form as the\nuniverse through a processual cosmogony of subtle elements that\nundergo a process of grossification, first into elements and then into\nobjects. On the level of subtle elements, \u012b\u015bvara\nfunctions as a cosmic mind named Hira\u1e47yagarbha, whose\nunrestricted intelligence pervades the universe. This cosmic mind is\nenlivened by its fundamental ground of consciousness-existence\n(brahman). On the level of coarse element composition, the\nperceptible universe is akin to \u012b\u015bvara\u2019s\nphysical body or brain. In this form \u012b\u015bvara is\nnamed Vir\u0101t. \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s view of the universe at\nthe empirical level, with its universal mind and fundamental nature as\nconsciousness, parallels some contemporary iterations of panentheism\nand panpsychism, particularly top-down cosmopsychism; however, his\nultimate view of nondual brahman collapses any questions\nabout the individual derivation or instantiation of nondual\nconsciousness. (See Gasparri 2019; Vaidya 2020; and Albahari 2019 for\ncomparisons of Advaita Ved\u0101nta and cosmopsychism).\n\nIndividuals are microcosms homologous to the \u012b\u015bvara\nmacrocosm; however, they are part and parcel of the universe. They are\nontologically dependent on \u012b\u015bvara and lack any\nobjective ontological power of projection beyond subjective\nprojections like dreaming and imagination. While the individual has a\npart to whole relationship with \u012b\u015bvara from the\nmind-body standpoint, ultimately there is only numerical identity\nbetween the individual and \u012b\u015bvara from the\nstandpoint of existence identified as pure consciousness.\n\u012a\u015bvara is the \u201cknower of the field\u201d\n(k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a)\u2014the core of subjectivity\npresent in all living beings and identified with brahman as\npure consciousness (BhGBh 13.2).\n3. Consciousness, Mind, and Personal Identity\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara does not intend his position that existence exists\nwithout objective location to be a paradox or a kind of obscurantist\nmysticism (see\n \u00a72.1\n above). He believes the world is mysterious in that it is\nindeterminable, but not so existence itself. His crucial point is that\nthe singular place to discover existence without objectifying it is\nwithin the foundation of our own phenomenal experience\u2014as\nconsciousness itself. \u015aa\u1e45kara analyzes consciousness\n(cit or caitanyam) through both perspectives of his\ntwo orders of reality. From the provisional empirical order,\nconsciousness is a witnessing presence (s\u0101k\u1e63in) by\nwhich all mental cognition is revealed as known. The absolute\nperspective strips consciousness of all relational properties,\nincluding intentionality and its status as a witness, leaving only the\nintrinsic self-illuminating nature of consciousness remaining. He\nidentifies this pure non-intentional consciousness as numerically\nidentical with nondual existence, which is brahman.\n3.1 Witnessing Consciousness\n\nFrom the standpoint of individual experience, witnessing consciousness\nis the locus of one\u2019s subjective being, the basic sense of\nself-existence, and the foundation of self-identity. It is the glue\nthat unifies disparate forms of experience like waking, dreaming, and\ndifferent modes of perception, and it accounts for memory and\ndiachronic personal identity (BrS\u016bBh 2.3.31; B\u1e5bUBh 4.3.7).\nThis consciousness is distinct from an autobiographical sense of self\nconstructed through recollective memory traces. \u015aa\u1e45kara\ndistinguishes witnessing consciousness from the mind, mental\nqualities, and cognitive modes. Consciousness is not composed of\nphysical materials, structures, or processes, whereas the mind is\ncomposed of inert subtle matter. Consciousness is not an emergent\nproperty of the brain and body, which are composed of inert coarse\nmatter, because that which is inert cannot give rise to sentiency.\n(See Ram-Prasad 2001a on Advaita\u2019s consciousness and\ncontemporary physicalism).\n\nWitnessing consciousness always accompanies cognition (see, e.g.,\nB\u1e5bUBh 1.4.10; KeUBh 1.2, 2.4). When one\u2019s mind assumes the\nform of intentional objects, the cognition is immediately manifested\nas known in the presence of witnessing consciousness. Consciousness\nillumines cognitions directly with infallible access and without the\nmediation of another mental mode. It reveals first order states of\ncognition, including sense perception and internal states such as\naffect and imagination; as well as second order states such as\nintrospection and meta-cognitive monitoring. Yet the witness is not\nitself a meta-function of the mind, such as an inner sense, a higher\norder cognition, or an introspective awareness that deliberately\nrecognizes the fact of one\u2019s experience. The witness is not a\nseparate substantial entity at all according to \u015aa\u1e45kara,\nnor does it possess agency in revealing cognition as a knower. It is\nintransitive and receptive, simply the passive witnessing itself\n(B\u1e5bUBh 1.4.10; TaiUBh 2.1.1; KeUBh 2.4). Only the mind possesses\nobject directed intentionality, not witnessing consciousness. (See\nGupta 1998 and Fort 1984 on witnessing consciousness. See Albahari\n2009; and Fasching 2011 and 2012 for contextualizing witnessing\nconsciousness in contemporary philosophy of mind).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara understands consciousness as immediately evident,\nyet outside the scope of any means of knowledge. As the illuminating\nbackground of all phenomenal states, witnessing consciousness is the\npresupposition of all epistemological knowing. It is intrinsically\nfirst-personal. Consciousness is therefore not objectifiable (KeUBh\n2.1). This conclusion further entails that it is unaffected by what it\nillumines and remains untouched by mental states. Consciousness does\nnot undergo any causation whatsoever because causation must presuppose\nits object-hood status.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara views witnessing consciousness as invariable\ndespite the fluctuations of mental modes. One foundational argument\nfor this is his analysis of waking, dreaming, and deep dreamless sleep\nstates based on the B\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka and\nM\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya Upani\u1e63ads. He considers\nthese three mental states as exhaustive of human experience, and\nclaims that consciousness persists constantly through all three\ndespite their mutual exclusivity. When awakening from a dream state,\nthough the dream world and dream body discontinue, there is no rupture\nto the continuity of one\u2019s consciousness. Consciousness\ncontinues seamlessly even in deep dreamless sleep where ego and agency\nresolve into an unmanifest state and subject-object distinctions\ncollapse.\n\nOne might object that persistence of consciousness in deep sleep is\nnot possible given the mainstream premise of identifying consciousness\nas intentional experience. \u015aa\u1e45kara disagrees with the\npremise that consciousness is intrinsically intentional. (This was a\nmatter of great debate between Advaita Ved\u0101nta and rival\nphilosophies like Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika). He counters that\nthe absence of intentional experience in deep sleep does not entail\nthe lack of consciousness insofar as consciousness is not\nintrinsically intentional. It exists even in the absence of cognition\nrepresenting an object. Rejecting his position is difficult because\none cannot claim direct perception of unconsciousness in deep sleep,\nand in that case cannot inductively infer unconsciousness either.\nRather than viewing deep sleep as the absence of consciousness,\n\u015aa\u1e45kara claims there is simply an absence of objects.\nConsciousness of the absence of objects is not the absence of\nconsciousness. This is akin to having one\u2019s eyes wide open and\nseeing but in a pitch-black room. Consciousness simply has nothing to\nillumine, therefore no intentional experience occurs nor any awareness\nof one\u2019s self as a knower. This presence of consciousness in\ndeep sleep is possible because it is self-illuminating and exists\nindependently from objects or knowing agents. (See\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s discussions of deep sleep in B\u1e5bUBh\n4.3, GKBh ch.1, and BrS\u016bBh 3.2.7\u201310. For further studies\nsee Thompson 2015; Comans 1990; and Sharma 2004).\n3.2 Self-Illumination of Consciousness\n\nWitnessing consciousness is elusive because it is unobjectifiable. It\nescapes our attention because it stands behind cognitive\nintentionality and cannot attend to itself. One cannot isolate the\nwitness by pulling it to one side and objects to another, for in\ndrawing a line between the two, both become objects of consciousness.\nConsciousness cannot become an objective content of consciousness. If\none infers that this non-finding of consciousness is evidence of its\nnon-existence, \u015aa\u1e45kara counters that one cannot deny their\nown consciousness (BrS\u016bBh 2.3.7). Consciousness is self-evident.\nIt cannot admit its own absence or antecedent negation, for any\ndismissal of consciousness presupposes its very existence.\nConsciousness thus falls outside the scope of negation.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara defines the intrinsic nature of consciousness as\nuniquely self-illuminating (svaprak\u0101\u015ba) because it\ndoes not require a second awareness for it to be known. Consciousness\nis intrinsically reflexive, immediate, and self-revealing in all\ncognition, while simultaneously remaining the non-object of knowledge.\nIt is self-established in that it does not require a means of\nknowledge to be known, nor any proof or justification for its\nexistence. It is self-disclosing. No second thing mediates its access\nto itself (see \u015aa\u1e45kara on B\u1e5bUBh 4.3, TaiUBh\n2.1.1).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara repudiates rival philosophies such as the\nNy\u0101ya school which rejects witnessing consciousness and\nself-illumination in favor of other-illumination\n(paraprak\u0101\u015ba)\u2014a thesis more akin to\ncontemporary higher order theories. Ny\u0101ya argues that a second\ncognition is required to illumine the first.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s basic counter-critique is that if a primary\ncognition requires a second apperceptive cognition to be known, then\nthe second would require a third, etc., leading to a vicious infinite\nregression fallacy. In that case no perception could ever be known.\nThe self-illumination of witnessing consciousness accounts for the\nimmediacy of cognition without falling into an infinite regress of\nmental modes (BrS\u016bBh 2.2.28; B\u1e5bUBh 4.3.7). There is no need\nto apprehend the witness because it is self-established. If\nconsciousness cannot become its own object, yet does not require a\nsecond, subsequent, or higher order cognition to reveal itself, than\nan infinite regression fallacy does not arise.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara also critiques the view of some Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhist philosophers, Vasubandhu and Dharmak\u012brti for example,\nwho argue that a given cognition or mental state can simultaneously\nreveal itself and its object. Their self-illumination thesis is quite\nsimilar to Advaita Ved\u0101nta but endeavors to be more parsimonious\nby eliding the witnessing consciousness. \u015aa\u1e45kara counters\nthat a self-illuminating cognition is incoherent because it is subject\nto the reflexivity fallacy (BrS\u016bBh 2.2.28). Just as a knife\ncannot cut itself, so too is cognition unable to objectify itself. A\ncognition requires a different source of illumination to be known.\nThis is also a matter of direct experience, for we are aware of a\ncognition\u2019s changes such as its origination and destruction and\nthe arising of a new cognition. A source of illumination distinct from\nthe cognition itself is required to know such changes.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara contends that the self-illumination of witnessing\nconsciousness does not similarly fall to a reflexivity fallacy (KeUBh\n1.3). Even though consciousness is immediately known, it does not\nobjectify itself. Self-illuminating consciousness does not come into a\nrelationship with itself. It does not entail being subject and object\nsimultaneously, which would be incoherent, for there is no distinction\nto be made between itself and consciousness of itself. (See Mackenzie\n2012; Ram-Prasad 2007; Timalsina 2009; Indich 1980; and Fasching 2021\nfor further discussions of self-illumination).\n3.3 Reflection: Consciousness, Mind, and Personal Identity\n\nAs the foundation of experience and presupposition of knowledge,\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s witnessing consciousness precedes his\nepistemology. The difficulty he faces, however, is how to bridge\nself-illuminating consciousness, which is unchanging and\nnon-relational, to cognition and intentional experience within the\nindividual knower. He develops a reflection or semblance\n(pratibimba or \u0101bh\u0101sa) theory of\nconsciousness to address such issues. The deeper purpose of this\ntheory however is to develop an account for individuals superimposing\nfalse identities on consciousness (see US ch.18 for\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s most detailed discussion of reflection, as\nwell as B\u1e5bUBh 4.3.7 and ChUBh 6.3.2).\n\nFor \u015aa\u1e45kara, \u012b\u015bvara\u2019s emanation\ninto the universe not only indicates that the universe is sentient,\nbut also how living beings come to possess phenomenal consciousness\nand identify themselves as individuals. Even though the entire\nuniverse is sentient, individual sentiency is only expressed under the\ncondition of having a mind. He employs the analogy of reflection to\nexplain the relationship of mind and consciousness, and to\nprovisionally wed intrinsic reflexivity with cognitive intentionality.\nHis theory of reflection is also a novel way of addressing the\ndecombination problem in cosmopsychism\u2014the explanatory gap\nbetween universal and individual organism consciousness. (See Albahari\n2019 on the decombination problem).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s common term for the mind is the\n\u201cinner instrument\u201d (anta\u1e25kara\u1e47a). He\ncategorizes the mind in different ways in accordance with his source\ntexts (see BrS\u016bBh 2.3.32 for example), yet consistently\ndistinguishes between two functions:\n\nthe intellect (buddhi) which is the mental function of\ndetermination and definitive knowing; and\nthe manas, which includes sensory, affective, and\nconative functions as well as indecision.\n\n\nHe also includes two additional functions:\n\nthe I-notion (aha\u1e43k\u0101ra\u2013literally the\n\u201cI-maker\u201d,) which is one\u2019s sense of self; and\nthe power of recollection (citta)\n\n\n(see, e.g., his commentary on M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya\n2. The later Advaita tradition standardized the mind as having this\nfour-fold function). \u015aa\u1e45kara maintains an Upani\u1e63adic\nview that minds are materially constituted by sattva, the\nsubtlest aspect of each primary element. Sattva has a\nqualitative predominance of lucidity and transparency. It makes the\nmind akin to the reflective surface of a mirror capable of reflecting\nlight, or like a transparent glass that allows light to pass through\nwhile illuminating variations on its surface. Unlike minds, mediums\nlike rocks are inert because of their opacity. They lack enough\nsattva constitution to be reflective even though they are\nalso fundamentally grounded in consciousness.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara identifies the reflective medium specifically as\nthe buddhi (B\u1e5bUBh 4.3.7). Just as light is pervasive\nbut only becomes visible through a reflective medium (because space\ndoes not reveal light), so too is consciousness expressed\nexperientially only in the reflective medium of the intellect. The\nintellect takes on the semblance of consciousness. Consciousness thus\nappears to be located in one\u2019s mind even though all-pervasive.\nThe mind depends on reflected consciousness for its experience of\nitself, like we use a mirror reflection to see ourselves. The mind\nalso depends on consciousness to cognize objects, like using the\nmirror reflection of light to illumine things in darkness. The\nreflection enables intentionality even though the prototype witnessing\nconsciousness is non-intentional and remains untouched in the\nappearance of causation.\n\nReflection is the seed of individuation and the I-notion because mind\nappears to be the locus of consciousness. Mind becomes the reflexive\ncenter of self-identification, manifesting as knower-ship, doer-ship,\nand enjoyer-ship. The reflection further extends through the sense\norgans, which are also predominantly sattva, to encompasses\nthe body\u2019s periphery through the sense of touch. This extension\nforms a constellation of experiential points of reference that\ncircumscribes self-identity as the complex of mind, body, and sense\norgans (see B\u1e5bUBh 4.3.7; ChUBh 8.8.1\u20132; BrS\u016bBh\n2.3.28\u201330).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara employs another theory, the limitation theory\n(avaccheda), to help explain the individuation of\nconsciousness. This theory counters potential problems arising from\nthe reflection theory, such as assuming a genuine duality of mind and\nconsciousness, or that consciousness undergoes causation and entry, or\nthat it actually resides locatively in the mind. The limitation theory\nexplains that just as we mistakenly perceive nondual space as\ndelimited by an object\u2014for example, a pot delimiting a pot\nspace\u2014so too do we misunderstand non-dual consciousness as\ndelimited by the mind (see GKBh 3.3\u20139). The pot space is not a\ngenuine limiting property of space because space is not divisible by\nthe pot form. The pot space is an appearance. It is merely an as\nthough limiting property, a conditioning adjunct\n(up\u0101dhi) that we superimpose on to space to account for\nparticular functions (e.g., containing a liquid). So too, do people\nmistakenly assume the mind-body-sense complex possesses consciousness\nand that consciousness is intrinsically intentional. In reality, the\nmind-body-sense complex is merely an up\u0101dhi that does\nnot possess or limit nondual consciousness.\n\nFor \u015aa\u1e45kara, the reflection of consciousness is an as\nthough appearance because all-pervasive consciousness is not subject\nto movement or change. Consciousness is not like a substance that\nundergoes modification or entry within time and space. It remains\nuntouched and unaffected, like the prototype image is untouched by its\nreflection or universal space is unaffected by the pot (BrS\u016bBh\n2.3.46). Furthermore, literal entry is also not possible because the\nreflection is less real than its prototype. \u015aa\u1e45kara argues\nthat a real thing (consciousness) cannot enter into a less real one\n(mind) because they are of two different orders of reality. My limited\nsense of self-identity, what I take to be me, is merely a reflection.\nIt only appears to be my self like a reflected facial image appears to\nbe my face. My actual face, the prototype, is more real than the\nreflection and does not literally enter the mirror (US 18.85\u20136).\nFurthermore, my facial reflection possesses no existence apart from my\nface. Self-identity with the mind-body-sense organs is similarly\nvirtual, not fully real; yet people remain unaware of this fact\nbecause they are mired in self-ignorance and enamored with their\nreflections.\n\nThe intention of the reflection analogy is not to establish a\ndefinitive metaphysical process of how one becomes conscious; but\nrather to reveal consciousness as untouched, and to point out the\nfundamental epistemological problem of falsely buying into constructed\nself-identities as if they are fundamental features of reality. This\nintention parallels his use of cosmogonies to undermine our assumed\nreality of the world and point back towards the metaphysical ground of\nexistence (see\n \u00a72.2\n above). Similarly, the reflection theory obliquely points back\ntowards the prototype, the witness, which is the ground of pure\nconsciousness underlying the reflection. Recognizing that ground cuts\nthrough mistaken self-identities. The reflection analogy thus provides\na conceptual framework to discriminate consciousness from all points\nof reflected identity from within the starting point of our\nphenomenology. This project is difficult however because consciousness\nis unobjectifiable, situated elusively behind cognition so to speak,\nand is transparent to cognition. Consciousness and intellect cannot be\nseparated like a blade of grass from its sheath (B\u1e5bUBh 4.3.7).\nCognition is also subtly embedded in bodily identity and invariably\naccompanied by a sense of knower-ship/I-ness and\nownership/for-me-ness; however, \u015aa\u1e45kara claims that\nembodiment, knower-ship and ownership are all objectifiable\ncognitions. They are known and therefore not intrinsic to witnessing\nconsciousness.\n\nThe distinction of witnessing consciousness from mind and objects\nappears dualistic from the empirical order perspective but transitions\nto nonduality from the absolute perspective. Witnessing consciousness\nis the bridge between the two orders, an ontological primitive that is\nfundamental to one\u2019s self as well as all reality. Pure\nconsciousness matches the nature of nondual existence as free of name\nand form. Consciousness is \u201cpure\u201d, in that it is free from\nany relation, predication, or intentionality. Consciousness is unlike\nany object because it is unobjectifiable. It is ultimately not even\nsubject to time or space, which are themselves objects of the witness.\nLike pure existence, consciousness is self-established. It has no\nparts, is irreducible, and stands outside of causation and dependence\nrelations. Consciousness is a constant unchanging presence, the only\ncontinuity of existence persisting through the process of infinite\nobject reductions in searching for an object\u2019s metaphysical\nground. It resists qualification, eliminative reduction, or dependence\non a second thing.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s philosophical conclusion is that\nnon-reducible existence is numerically identical to pure\nnon-intentional consciousness. Consciousness is nondual. It is the\nintrinsic nature of brahman itself. Consciousness is not\nsimply the witness of one\u2019s experience. It is the ultimate\nground comprising an individual\u2019s self-existence, the single\nself (\u0101tman) of all sentient beings from a blade of\ngrass to \u012b\u015bvara, and the metaphysical foundation of\nthe entire universe.\n3.4 Superimposition: The Fundamental Problem of Ignorance\n\nThe reflection and limitation theories above point to a fundamental\nerror shared by all beings. If individuation is the apparent\ndelimitation of nondual consciousness, then assuming personal identity\nis real is actually an error, a manifestation of ignorance.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara explains that we falsely identify with\n\u201cI\u201d, construct the possessiveness of \u201cmine\u201d,\nand then cling to them. We mutually superimpose consciousness on to\nour mind-body, and the mind-body on to consciousness (i.e., I am the\nmind-body, and the mind-body is I). Superimposition is possible even\nthough consciousness is not an object because it is the content of\n\u201cI\u201d and always immediate in one\u2019s experience. We\nassume the mind intrinsically possesses consciousness, and that\nconsciousness is subject to the mind-body\u2019s limitations, like\none may mistake a scratch in the mirror as actually marring\none\u2019s face. Similarly, one may mistake a clear crystal as red\ndue to a red flower placed behind it. Like the crystal or mirror, the\nmind-body is a conditioning adjunct (up\u0101dhi) that\nprovides a locus of individuation. This error conceals one\u2019s\nfundamental nondual nature, the ground of superimposition, like\nmistaking a rope for a snake conceals its rope nature. (See\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s seminal discussion of superimposition in\nhis introduction to the BrS\u016b titled, the \u201cCommentary on\nSuperimposition\u201d [Adhy\u0101sabh\u0101\u1e63ya]).\n\nThe epistemic failure of mutual superimposition is caused by ignorance\n(avidy\u0101). \u015aa\u1e45kara identifies\navidy\u0101 as the root cause of all existential suffering.\nIt produces a baseline of fear and anxiety due to assuming one\u2019s\nself as a limited being subject to sorrow, sickness, and death. Based\non this error, individuals seek wholeness, happiness, and\nlimitlessness through known ends like material gains, social status,\nhedonic pleasures, or reaching heavenly worlds; however, such\nendeavors are perpetually bound to fail because results of finite\nactions are limited, transient, and dependent. They may provide\ntemporary reprieves or happy mental states, but do not provide the\nlimitless wholeness of liberation. Only the direct understanding of\none\u2019s self as nondual brahman negates the error of\nsuperimposition, and frees one from the beginningless karmic\ncycle of death, rebirth, and suffering. One\u2019s cluster of\nmistaken self-identities and the whole psychological scaffolding that\nperpetuates suffering collapses only by removing the kingpin of\nignorance. Then only nondual consciousness remains standing. Upon\nrecognizing this reality, the mind rests in its own intrinsic being\nwith absolute fullness, peacefulness, and tranquility.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s soteriological project is thus primarily\nepistemological with several positive psychological repercussions.\n\nSeveral questions about \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s position on\nignorance became contentious in post-\u015aa\u1e45kara Advaita: Is\nthe locus of ignorance in the individual or brahman? Is\nignorance simply misapprehension or does it have a two-fold power of\ncovering and projection? Does it hold both epistemological and\nontological powers? Is there a distinction of cosmic root ignorance\nand secondary individual ignorance? And what is its relationship with\nm\u0101y\u0101? Such questions have caused several\nintra-Advaita debates as well as philosophical critiques from rival\ntraditions such as R\u0101m\u0101nuja\u2019s\nVi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita Ved\u0101nta and\nM\u0101dhva\u2019s Dvaita Ved\u0101nta. (For further discussions of\nthese issues see Potter 1981: 78\u201380; Ingalls 1953; Comans 2000:\n263\u20137; Doherty 2005; and Grimes 1990).\n4. Contemplative Philosophical Methods\n\nAccording to \u015aa\u1e45kara, because the individual is nondual\nbrahman in reality, they already are what they seek to\nbe\u2014unlimited, whole, and complete. The difficulty, however, is\nthat one\u2019s felt sense of finite identity contradicts nonduality\nand engenders a seeming distance between the person and\nbrahman. Mok\u1e63a thus appears to be a future\nattainment rather than a recognition of present reality. This false\npremise entices one into action with the intent to gain or become\nbrahman, but one cannot attain anew what is already attained.\nAction is superfluous to accomplish an already accomplished fact. In\nfact, the more one attempts to gain, reach, or experience liberation\nwhile mistakenly presupposing its distance, the further it recedes\nlike the horizon. This quagmire of action is not intractable though\nbecause both bondage and liberation are just figurative\u2014no\nchange occurs in reality. The solution is purely self-knowledge, a\nradical epistemic shift in perspective by which one simultaneously\nsheds limited self-identities and recognizes their existence as\nnondual consciousness. Only this direct immediate recognition of\nnonduality defeats the error of superimposition. One becomes\nbrahman simply by knowing brahman (MuU 3.2.9).\n\u015aa\u1e45kara illustrates this concept of accomplishing the\naccomplished with the \u201ctenth man story\u201d (TaiUBh 2.1.1).\nTen children cross a river and then regroup to count each other. Each\nchild counts only nine, and they sorrowfully conclude that the missing\ntenth child must have drowned. A passerby sees their plight and\nstates, \u201cyou are the tenth!\u201d They then realize they simply\nforgot to count themselves. The tenth child was never truly lost or\ngained. (See Comans 2000; Suthren Hirst 2005; and Rambachan 1991 for\nfurther discussions of \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s method).\n4.1 Action and Meditation\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara is ambivalent about actions such as yogic\nmeditation, ritual practice, or ethical duties within his method. On\nthe one hand he strives to undermine the importance of mental or\nphysical action as an independent methodology for liberation. Action\nis a cause for bondage, not a means of liberation, because it always\npresupposes the reality of individual agency and contributes to a\ncycle of further desire and action. Furthermore, any product of action\nis finite and transient (Potter 1981: 38\u201341). \u015aa\u1e45kara\nviews action as having no epistemic fruitfulness independent of a\nmeans of knowledge. He draws a critical distinction based on content\ndependence. Physical actions such as ritual performance or mental\nactions like imagination or meditation are dependent on an\nindividual\u2019s will. They arise independently of the nature of the\nthing concerned. Veridical cognition, however, is ultimately dependent\non the nature of the object. It is determined by the object through a\nproper means of knowledge, with no options or alternatives in terms of\nan agent\u2019s choice. Action is therefore incapable of providing\nveridical knowledge whatsoever, let alone knowledge of non-duality\n(BrS\u016bBh 1.1.4). This critique of action collapses any\nmethodological dichotomy of theory and practice, which is intrinsic to\nboth ritual practice and yogic meditation methods. Liberating\nself-knowledge is not subject to any kind of ritual injunctions. It is\nnot procedural knowledge, nor the result of procedural knowledge. (See\nRam-Prasad 2000 on \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s distinction of knowledge\nand action. See Bader 1990 and Dalal 2016 on his approach to\nmeditation).\n\nOn the other hand, \u015aa\u1e45kara accepts the secondary importance\nof yogic practices that involve a variety of meditation methods,\ndevotional practices, ascetic austerities, moral psychology, and the\ndevelopment of ethical virtues and action ethics (see Sundaresan 2003\non Yoga in \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s method). They may function as\nindirect means to liberation. \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s ambivalence\ntowards action is not a contradiction. He recognizes a voluntary\nelement in any knowledge to some degree. One must create the proper\nconditions to align a means of knowledge. For example, to visually\nperceive an object one may have to open their eyes and turn their\nhead. Then visual knowledge automatically takes place. Similarly, the\nAdvaitin must possess a prepared mind to recognize brahman.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara provides a fourfold set of prerequisite conditions\ncharacterizing this qualified student: (1) discrimination between what\nis transient and eternal; (2) dispassion towards objects of enjoyment;\n(3) perfecting practices such as the control of the mind and senses;\nand (4) the desire for liberation (BrS\u016bBh 1.1.1).\n\nYogic and ethical practices, as well as analyses of the limitations of\ngoals like pleasure, wealth, status, and heaven provide the conditions\nfor self-knowledge by cultivating mental purity\n(anta\u1e25kara\u1e47a\u015buddhi). Mental purity is the\nremoval of epistemic obstructions to knowing brahman, such as\ngreed, anger, selfishness, violence, jealousy, and distraction. It\nalso includes developing positive qualifications such as ethical\nattitudinal values of equanimity, acceptance, truthfulness,\ncompassion, and benevolence. Mediation practices provide mental\nstability and focus. These qualifications hone the mind\u2019s\ncapacity to be a proper container for text-sparked knowledge; though,\nin theory, if a student is already sufficiently qualified, they need\nnot undergo any such practices.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s commentary on the\nBhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 provides a rich resource for his yogic\nmethods and ethical virtues. For example, following BhG ch. 2\u20134,\nhe endorses a yoga of action (karmayoga). Karmayoga\nis a yogic process that employs a philosophy of action to cultivate\nemotional growth and world participation. It extends Vedic ritual\nframeworks of sacrificial contribution and consumption to all actions.\nAll action becomes analogous to devotionally placing ritual oblations\ninto the sacrificial fire as offerings to deities. The Advaitin\nyogin offers actions altruistically to\n\u012b\u1e63vara for the benefit of all beings\n(lokasa\u1e45gra\u1e25) and the harmonious functioning of\nthe world. Just as the sacrificer equanimously consumes the remnants\nof sacrificial food offerings as a blessing, sans gustatory pleasure\nor aversion, so too does the yogin learn to accept the\nresults of their actions with equanimity. Karmayoga intends\nto free one from the binding attachment of desires caused by the\nmistaken belief that desired objects possess one\u2019s happiness. It\ndevelops internal renunciation, equipoise, gratitude, and benevolence,\nwhile releasing one from the anger, sadness, and inner turmoil that\narise from thwarted desire. This yogic attitude extends not only\nexternally to society, beings, and world, but also internally to\none\u2019s physiology and psychology.\n4.2 The Triple Process and the Means of Nondual Knowledge\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara embraces particular verbal methods to understand\npropositions affirming nonduality crystallized in pithy\nUpani\u1e63adic sentences. (Post-\u015aa\u1e45kara Advaitins focused\non four such \u201cgreat sentences\u201d\n[mah\u0101v\u0101kyas]). These methods include continuity and\ndiscontinuity (anvaya and vyatireka), secondary\nindication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101), and negative language\n(neti neti). \u015aa\u1e45kara does not clearly codify these\nseparately, but it may be most accurate to describe his primary method\nas continuity and discontinuity (see, e.g., GKBh 13.13).\nPost-\u015aa\u1e45kara Advaitins often discuss his method as\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 instead; however, \u015aa\u1e45kara\nappears to view all three as varying iterations of a single\nmethod.\n\nAnvaya and vyatireka is a method of discriminative\nreasoning to determine the relationship of what persists and what does\nnot persist between two things. It reveals whether one term is\nindependent of another. For example, in the analogy of the clay and\nits forms (see\n \u00a72.1\n above), when a particular form of clay (such as a pot) occurs, then\nclay occurs (continuity). And when that particular form (pot) is\nabsent (discontinuity) after being shaped into a plate, then clay\nstill occurs. One may apply this method, for example, to consciousness\nand mental states. Consciousness is continuous through the\ndiscontinuous states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep and never\nsubject to its negative instance of discontinuity. Consciousness\nitself can never be absent. One cannot escape from one\u2019s own\nconsciousness, nor can one directly separate a particular mental state\nfrom consciousness because consciousness itself is not mutually\nexclusive of anything and not subject to the negative instance of\nvyatireka. However, separating consciousness and a particular\nmental state is possible through anvaya and\nvyatireka because the states themselves are mutually\nexclusive. For example, dream reality and waking reality are mutually\nexclusive, pointing to the fact that consciousness is independent of\nthem even as it persists through both. (See Cardona 1981;\nSatchidanandendra 1964 [1989]; Halbfass 1991: 162\u201377; Comans\n1996: 59\u201363; and Mayeda 1992: 51\u201358 on anvaya and\nvyatireka).\n\nMah\u0101v\u0101kyas like \u201cI am Brahman\u201d\n(B\u1e5bU 1.4.10: aha\u1e43 brahm\u0101smi) or \u201cYou\nare that\u201d (ChU 6.8.7: tat tvam asi) are identity\nstatements that form an equation consisting of two or more\nco-referential terms in grammatical apposition. The equation\u2019s\nlack of logical congruence\u2014identifying the limited individual\n(aham) with nondual brahman, or you (tvam)\nwith that (tat) universe for example\u2014contradict\nsyntactical expectancy. This prods the reader to use the\nanvaya and vyatireka method to resolve the equation.\nIn the case of \u201cYou are that\u201d, tvam negates the\nmediacy of tat as existence external to one\u2019s Self. And\ntat negates any subjective limitations to the consciousness\nreferred to in tvam. The apposition thus restricts what does\nnot persist between the two terms to reveal what is continuous and\nnumerically identical\u2014namely pure consciousness and\nundifferentiated existence. The identity statement reveals that you\n(tvam), the pure consciousness which is the underlying\nexistence of the individual, is that (tat) pure existence\nwhich is the metaphysical ground of all objects. Existence and\nconsciousness are one, not two. There is no distinction between the\nam-ness of one\u2019s self and the is-ness of objects. (See ChUBh\nch.6 and US ch.18 for \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s interpretation of\n\u201cYou are that\u201d).\n\nLak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101\u2019s indirect implication employs\na theory of metonymy which distinguishes between literal denotative\nmeanings and implied connotative meanings. The contradictory\njuxtaposition of an identity statement such as \u201cYou are\nthat\u201d triggers a particular form of secondary implication in\nwhich a portion of the primary meaning is rejected while another part\nis retained. The canonical Advaita example is, \u201cThis (person\nthat you see now) is that Devadatta (whom you knew in the\npast)\u201d. Here, the primary referents of \u201cthis\u201d and\n\u201cthat\u201d cannot be identical because \u201cthis\u201d and\n\u201cthat\u201d refer to different locations and times, Devadatta\nin the past somewhere else and Devadatta here and now. The two\nDevadattas are not completely identical because of their relationships\nto time and place, nor are they completely separate. The import of the\nsentence creates a cognition of a single Devadatta substantive that is\nnot connected to a specific time or place. (See Lipner 1997; Bartley\n2002: 111\u201323; Suthren Hirst 2005: 145\u201351; Kunjunni Raja\n1969: 251\u201354, and the entry on the\n literal-nonliteral distinction\n for further discussions of indirect implication).\n\nNeti neti (negative language) literally means \u201cnot\n(this), not (this)\u201d. Its negation targets the discontinuity\naspect by stripping away all qualifications to personal identity and\nthe external world. This process removes false superimpositions of\nbody, senses, and mind previously attributed to brahman.\nNegative language attempts to avoid defining absolute reality as a\nthing in the world. It denies any nameability of brahman, its\ngrammatical object. This is directly tied to brahman\u2019s\nunobjectifiable status, for the hermeneutical premise of\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s negative language is the inability of\npredicates to apply to absolute reality. To give positive predicates\nwould reify the absolute to a finite entity (on this see B\u1e5bUBh\n2.3.6).\n\nNeti neti negates all properties, conceptions, limitations,\nand identities attributed to brahman; however, it cannot lose\nall reference. Passages using negative language may push their object\naway, allowing the unobjectifiable object to continually slip back and\nbeyond; however, the purpose is not open ended. Negation strips away\nall false conceptions, including one\u2019s tendency to grasp after\nthe absolute, without lapsing into nihilism or an infinite regression\n(BrS\u016bBh 3.2.22). What appears to be an illogical infinite regress\nof negation is harnessed as a semantic force for understanding the\nabsolute. Negative language turns onto itself as well, negating its\nprior negation and its own referential delimitations. When all\nconceptions of \u201cI\u201d as \u201cthis\u201d or\n\u201cthat\u201d are negated, then one\u2019s self is understood to\nbe nondual consciousness.\n\nNegative language usually constitutes half of a paradox that affirms\npositive and negative propositions at the same time. Textual instances\nof negation usually follow positive statements about brahman\nwhich provide an explicit positive proposition of continuity. There is\na positive assertion of an entity but the negative language strips\nthat entity of any limitations or finite objectivity. This methodology\nthreads the needle of indicating brahman\u2019s presence\nwithout objectifying it. It ensures that the reader neither grasps at\nan object nor falls into nihilism. The negative assertions of neti\nneti, which follow or imply a positive assertion, parallel the\nother two methods. Lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 and\nanvaya-vyatireka similarly depend on negation\nthrough mutual restriction, while simultaneously indicating the\nintrinsic nature of brahman without falling into\nnihilism.\n4.3 Self-Knowledge and Living While Liberated\n\nHow to exactly define liberation in \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s thought\nis inherently problematic. He does not provide a precise\nepistemological account of how knowledge of brahman takes\nplace. \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s conception of liberation removes\nitself from the boundaries of ordinary discourse, debate, and causal\nepistemology (See TaiUBh 2.9.1 for example). There is a metaphysical\nuncertainty about it, for on the one hand a liberating cognition may\nbe able to remove self-ignorance, but on the other it is problematic\nto reduce ever-present liberation to a cognition which is a product\nand a temporal event. From the empirical perspective liberation may be\ninexplicable and indeterminable due to its transition to ultimate\nnondual reality.\n\nPerhaps the greatest difficulty is describing what \u015aa\u1e45kara\nthought about the transition from what appears to be descriptive\nknowledge to direct knowledge, or from a type of modal knowledge to a\nknowledge of intrinsic being that is pure consciousness. In his view,\nunderstanding the Upani\u1e63adic identity statement generates a\nunique cognition revealing the veridical knowledge, \u201cI am\nbrahman\u201d\u2014that one is indiscernible from nondual\nconsciousness, numerically identical with brahman, and the\nreality of everything. This knowledge removes root ignorance to negate\nsuperimposition veiling one\u2019s true nature. It strips all\nqualifications and relationships from consciousness, deconstructs the\nI-sense and knower-ship as unreal, and deindividuates the individual\nfrom all conditioning adjuncts (see Ram-Prasad 2001b: ch. 4). Then\nsuffering, karma, and rebirth have no locus in which to cling\nbecause only nondual consciousness remains.\n\nNondual knowledge does not entail subject-object distinction like\nobject cognitions because its content is identical to the\nconsciousness illuminating the cognition. Its content is\nbrahman itself (see, e.g., TaiUBh 2.1.1; MuUBh 3.1.2, 4; and\nBrS\u016bBh 2.1.14). There is no call to apperceive this knowledge for\nthe sake of a truth certifying inference. Extrinsic certification\ncannot determine its veridicality because intrinsic consciousness\n(svar\u016bpaj\u00f1\u0101nam) is self-illuminating and\ncannot be known by a second cognition. Its self-illumination entails\nits self-certification when directly known. The cognition\u2019s\nmodal form (vrttij\u00f1\u0101nam), however, is analogous\nto a self-immolating match. By recognizing its content, it\ncannibalizes its own modal form. It reveals its own modal appearance\nas an appearance, which is only brahman. In this process it loses its\nstatus as a means of knowledge, akin to a means of knowledge in a\ndream (BhGBh 2.69).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara uses the analogy of waking up from dreaming to\nillustrate understanding nonduality and the non-realism of the world\n(BrS\u016bBh 2.1.14). He does not characterize this as a mystical\nstate of union, an extraordinary oceanic experience, or a state of no\nmind. In fact, one cannot describe this knowledge as an experiential\nstate because states are objectifiable cognitions. Furthermore, this\nknowledge ostensibly negates experiential agency. His liberation is a\npurely epistemic shift that removes false conceptual constructions.\nFrom an epistemic perspective, \u015aa\u1e45kara sees the liberated\nperson as having no more dealings concerned with actions, instruments,\nand results. They have no more perception of duality, and possess no\nmore self-identity with the mind and body (B\u1e5bUBh 2.4.14,\n4.5.15); however, from a phenomenal perspective, liberation does not\nentail an annihilation of one\u2019s experience of the world\n(BrS\u016bBh 3.2.21). This is like a magician who remains unconfused\ndespite perceiving their own magical illusions. The liberated person\nrecognizes nonduality but continues living as an embodied individual\nexperiencing the world. This lasts according to the ongoing\nfructification of karma in their present birth (ChUbh\n6.14.2). One who is \u201cliving while liberated\u201d\n(j\u012bvanmukti) seamlessly inhabits the apparent paradoxes\nof being disembodied in the midst of embodiment, of acting while\nrecognizing their non-agency, and of perceiving the world despite\ndeindividuation. (See Fort 1998 on j\u012bvanmukti).\n\nA lucid dream experience is an ideal illustration of\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s liberation, though not found in his work.\nFor experienced lucid dreamers, the recognition that one is dreaming\npossesses a conviction that completely cuts through the appearance of\nthe dream fabric, but does so without eliminating perceptual dream\nexperience. They are epistemically aware of two orders of reality,\nwaking and dreaming, while phenomenally remaining in the less real\ndreaming order. The lucid dreamer is deindividuated from the dream\nbody, yet remains embodied within the dream experience. They recognize\nthat the dream is not separate from themselves, that it cannot touch\nthem, and that there is nothing to fear or gain from it. In\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s metaphysical view however, the empirical\norder is analogous to \u012b\u015bvara\u2019s dream, not\none\u2019s own. This view accommodates the universe\u2019s identity\nwith \u012b\u015bvara, along with intersubjective agreement\nand veridical cognition, without falling into solipsism. The\nindividual is not creating empirical reality, but rather making a\nmistake about it. Like the dream, empirical reality is not illusory\nfrom within its own order of reality.
