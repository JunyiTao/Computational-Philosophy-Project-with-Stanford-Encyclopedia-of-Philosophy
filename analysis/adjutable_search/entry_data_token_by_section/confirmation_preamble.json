    "main_text": "\n\nHuman cognition and behavior heavily relies on the notion that\nevidence (data, premises) can affect the credibility of hypotheses\n(theories, conclusions). This general idea seems to underlie sound and\neffective inferential practices in all sorts of domains, from everyday\nreasoning up to the frontiers of science. Yet it is also clear that,\neven with extensive and truthful evidence available, drawing a\nmistaken conclusion is more than a mere possibility. For painfully\ntangible examples, one only has to consider missed medical diagnoses\n(see Winters et al. 2012) or judicial errors (see Liebman et al.\n2000). The Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711\u20131776) is\nusually credited for having disclosed the theoretical roots of these\nconsiderations in a particularly transparent way (see Howson 2000,\nLange 2011, and Varzi 2008). In most cases of interest, Hume pointed\nout, many alternative candidate hypotheses remain logically compatible\nwith all the relevant information at one\u2019s disposal, so that\nnone of the former can be singled out by the latter with full\ncertainty. Thus, under usual circumstances, reasoning from evidence\nmust remain fallible.\n\nThis fundamental insight has been the source of a lasting theoretical\nchallenge: if amenable to analysis, the role of evidence as supporting\n(or infirming) hypotheses has to be grasped by more nuanced tools than\nplain logical entailment. As emphasized in a joke attributed to\nAmerican philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen (1880\u20131947), logic\ntextbooks had to be divided in two parts: in the first part, on\ndeductive logic, unwarranted forms of inference (deductive fallacies)\nare exposed; in the second part, on inductive logic, they are endorsed\n(see Meehl 1990, 110). In contemporary philosophy, confirmation\ntheory can be roughly described as the area where efforts have\nbeen made to take up the challenge of defining plausible models of\nnon-deductive reasoning. Its central technical term\u2014\nconfirmation\u2014has often been used more or less\ninterchangeably with \u201cevidential support\u201d,\n\u201cinductive strength\u201d, and the like. Here we will generally\ncomply with this liberal usage (although more subtle conceptual and\nterminological distinctions are sometimes drawn).\n\nConfirmation theory has proven a rather difficult endeavour. In\nprinciple, it would aim at providing understanding and guidance for\ntasks such as diagnosis, prediction, and learning in virtually any\narea of inquiry. Yet popular accounts of confirmation have often been\ntaken to run into troubles even when faced with toy philosophical\nexamples. Be that as it may, there is at least one real-world kind of\nactivity which has remained a prevalent target and benchmark, i.e.,\nscientific reasoning, and especially key episodes from the history of\nmodern and contemporary natural science. The motivation for this is\neasily figured out. Mature sciences seem to have been uniquely\neffective in relying on observed evidence to establish extremely\ngeneral, powerful, and sophisticated theories. Indeed, being capable\nof receiving genuine support from empirical evidence is itself a very\ndistinctive trait of scientific hypotheses as compared to other kinds\nof statements. A philosophical characterization of what science is\nwould then seem to require an understanding of the logic of\nconfirmation. And so, traditionally, confirmation theory has come to\nbe a central concern of philosophers of science.\n\nIn the following, major approaches to confirmation theory are\noverviewed according to a classification that is relatively standard\n(see Earman and Salmon 1992; Norton 2005): confirmation by instances\n(Section 1), hypothetico-deductivism and its variants (Section 2), and\nprobabilistic (Bayesian) approaches (Section 3).\n",
