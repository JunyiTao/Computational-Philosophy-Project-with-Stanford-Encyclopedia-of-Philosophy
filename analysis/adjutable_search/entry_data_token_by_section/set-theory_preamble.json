    "main_text": "\n\nSet theory is the mathematical theory of well-determined collections,\ncalled sets, of objects that are called members, or\nelements, of the set. Pure set theory deals exclusively with\nsets, so the only sets under consideration are those whose members are\nalso sets. The theory of the hereditarily-finite sets, namely\nthose finite sets whose elements are also finite sets, the elements of\nwhich are also finite, and so on, is formally equivalent to\narithmetic. So, the essence of set theory is the study of infinite\nsets, and therefore it can be defined as the mathematical theory of\nthe actual\u2014as opposed to potential\u2014infinite.\n\nThe notion of set is so simple that it is usually introduced\ninformally, and regarded as self-evident. In set theory, however, as\nis usual in mathematics, sets are given axiomatically, so their\nexistence and basic properties are postulated by the appropriate\nformal axioms. The axioms of set theory imply the existence of a\nset-theoretic universe so rich that all mathematical objects can be\nconstrued as sets. Also, the formal language of pure set theory allows\none to formalize all mathematical notions and arguments. Thus, set\ntheory has become the standard foundation for mathematics, as every\nmathematical object can be viewed as a set, and every theorem of\nmathematics can be logically deduced in the Predicate Calculus from\nthe axioms of set theory.\n\nBoth aspects of set theory, namely, as the mathematical science of the\ninfinite, and as the foundation of mathematics, are of philosophical\nimportance.\n",
