    "main_text": "The History in Letters and Macaulay as a critic of Burke || Response to Reflections on the Revolution in France\n3.2 Response to Reflections on the Revolution in France\n\nMacaulay\u2019s last published work goes to the heart of her disagreement\nwith Burke over the source of political legitimacy. Although Burke did\nnot share Hume\u2019s religious scepticism, like Hume he claimed government\nto be grounded in opinion, tradition, and respectful awe of\nsuperiority, and he wrote his Reflections to lament the way\nin which the French revolutionaries had debased the monarchy, in terms\nreminiscent of Hume\u2019s accusation that the Civil War levelers had,\n\u201cweakened the reverence, which the multitude owe to\nauthority\u201d. Burke\u2019s immediate target was a sermon preached by\nRichard Price at the Old Jewry, on the anniversary of the Glorious\nRevolution of 1688, in which Price declared that the king of Great\nBritain owes his crown to the choice of the people (Burke 2004,\n96\u20137). Against this, Burke argues that the intention of the\nDeclaration of Right, which established William II on the\nthrone, was to declare the rights and liberties of the subjects of\nGreat Britain, and to settle the succession of the crown. So, despite\na small deviation in the line of succession, British kings continued\nto owe their crowns to inheritance in the royal line (Burke 2004,\n100). He quotes the earlier Petition of Right to show that it\nis inherited custom that grounds and legitimizes the government.\n\n\nIn the famous law of the 3d of Charles I. called the Petition of\nRight, the parliament says to the king, \u201cyour subjects have\ninherited this freedom,\u201d claiming their franchises not\non abstract principles \u201cas the rights of men,\u201d but as the\nrights of Englishmen, and as a patrimony derived from their\nforefathers.\n\n\nMacaulay responds that, if the rights of Englishmen are not ultimately\ngrounded in abstract right, they are no rights at all. For if they\nultimately rest on the weakness or generosity of previous kings, then\nthey can with equal right be overturned by subsequent powerful or less\nkindly monarchs (Macaulay 1790, 30\u20131). So, if there are rights\nthey must be grounded in universal rights.\n\nJust as she had done in her earlier response to Burke, Macaulay\nattacks his claim that an aristocracy is necessary for civilized\nsociety, and necessary in order to defend the state. There is no need\nto have an opulent class for there to be elements in the population\nwho care about the nation, for \u201cevery citizen who possesses ever\nso small a share of property, is equally as\ntenacious of it as the most opulent member of society\u201d (Macaulay\n1790, 40\u20131). Inequality, she argues, in fact leads to envy, and\nultimately civil disturbance. And while she agrees that different\nclasses have different interests she asserts:\n\n\n\u2026 I know of no rational objection; nor can I think of\nany expedient to remove the well-grounded apprehensions of the\ndifferent interests which compose a commonwealth, than a fair\nand equal representation of the whole people;\n(Macaulay 1790, 48)\n\n\nThe French have moved far closer to this ideal, with a broad\nfranchise, than the English, with their pocket boroughs, which can be\nbought and sold, and their very limited representation.\n\nMacaulay concludes her pamphlet with a dilemma for all those who claim\nthat authority resides in conventions, which cannot be questioned or\noverthrown.\n\n\nFor if we say that lawful governments are formed on the\nauthority of conventions, it will be asked, who gave these\nconventions their authority? If we grant that they derived their\nauthority from the assent of the people, how came the people,\nit will be said, to exert such an authority at one period of\nsociety, and not at another? If we say it was necessity that\nrecovered to the social man the full rights of his nature, it will be\nasked, who is to be the judge of this necessity? why\ncertainly the people.\n\nThus, in every light in which we can place the argument, in\nevery possible mode of reasoning, we shall be driven back to elect\neither the first or the second of these propositions; either that an\nindividual, or some privileged persons, have an inherent and\nindefeasible right to make laws for the community, or that this\nauthority rests in the unalienable and indefeasible rights of man.\n(Macaulay 1790, 94\u20135)\n\n\nSince she takes it as accepted that the doctrine of the indefeasible\nright of kings is dead, she is able to conclude that, government,\n\u201ccan have no legitimate force, but in the\nwill of the people\u201d (Macaulay 1790, 95).\n",
