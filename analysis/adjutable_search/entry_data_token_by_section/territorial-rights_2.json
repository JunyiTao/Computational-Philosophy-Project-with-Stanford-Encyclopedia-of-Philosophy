    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || What is a theory of territorial justice?\n1.3 What is a theory of territorial justice?\n\nA theory of territorial justice has to explain and justify rights over\nterritory. It has to explain what rights there are, the limits of\nthese rights, and who holds these rights. In doing so, it has to\nexamine and justify the relationship between three different elements:\nthe people (or individual persons); land; and the regime, government\nor state. There are different ways in which these elements are related\nand different justificatory values may undergird these different\nconfigurations, but all extant theories offer an argument that relates\nthese different elements and justifies their particular\nconfigurations. \n\nThe main differences among these theories tend to track the following\ndimensions: (1) the putative territorial right-holder; (2) the value\nthat explains and justifies rights over territory and which limits the\nscope of each of these rights; and (3) the argument for connecting\nboth the justifying value and the rights to the particular\ngeographical area. Let\u2019s take these different dimensions in\norder. The first key difference among rival theories concerns their\nconception of the appropriate (or justified) territorial right-holder:\nis it the nation? the people? or the state? They also offer different\naccounts of the underlying value that justifies these rights: the main\ncontenders are peace and stability; justice; and self-determination.\nThe underlying value also affects the scope of the rights being\nclaimed, and indeed which set of rights in the bundle of rights can be\nso justified. A theory of territory has to explain how we can\ndemarcate the geographical domain that the rights range over. It is\nnot sufficient to explain in general that states need to be\nterritorial in order to realize whatever value is supposed to justify\nthem. The theory should explain which particular bits of territory are\nconnected to which states. This is called in the literature \u2018the\nparticularity question\u2019. To address this question, the theory\nneeds an argument that relates people and land to the state in ways\nthat justify rights over particular bits of territory, and\nthis is a difficult problem for one of the most prominent theories of\nterritory\u2014justice theories.\n",
