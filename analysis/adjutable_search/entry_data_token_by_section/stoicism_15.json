What signifies is uttered or\nwritten language (words, sentences) in the form of air struck or\nsymbols in ink or in clay, and, as such, a body. What is signified, on\nthe other hand, is an incorporeal, namely a lekton. The term\nitself is notoriously difficult to translate: from the verb\nlegein, \u201cto speak\u201d but also \u201cto\nreason\u201d, it is literally \u201cwhat can be said\u201d \u2013\nand not all lekta are in fact said. Lekta are\ndefined as \u201cthat which subsists in accordance with a rational\nimpression\u201d (Sextus, 33B), and they form the contents of\nrational impressions, concepts, and judgments.\n\nThe relationship of language to lekta is the subject of\ndebate, but it seems clear that lekta do not map neatly onto\nthe language that express them (Bobzien 2021). This is likely one of\nthe roots of the Stoic interest in ambiguity (on which see Atherton\n1993). Nonetheless, the Stoics identified and classified different\nparts of speech (proper noun, common noun, verb, conjunction, article,\nto which some add mesot\u00eas, which is usually taken to be\nthe participle, though it could be adverbs: Diogenes Laertius 33A,\n33M), each of which appear to express distinct signifieds. Verbs, for\nexample, typically express predicates\n(kat\u00eagor\u00eamata, 33\u039c; see detailed discussion in\nBobzien and Shogry 2020). Whether all parts of speech express\nlekta is unclear. Nouns, for example, may signify the elusive\ncases (pt\u00f4seis), or qualities, or both (Diogenes\nLaertius 33A, 33M, 34K; see Frede 1994a, Gaskin 1997, Bronowski 2019,\nch. 8\u20139).\n\nThe Stoics provide an extensive taxonomy of lekta. They begin\nby dividing them into complete and incomplete. Incomplete\nlekta include predicates, while complete lekta\nappear to be those usually expressed by syntactically complete\nsentences and include wishes, commands, questions, and the\nall-important propositions (axi\u00f4mata), which are\ntypically expressed by declarative sentences.\n",
