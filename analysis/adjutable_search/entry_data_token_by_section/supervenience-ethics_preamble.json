    "main_text": "\n\nWe sometimes think about the ethical significance of merely possible\ncircumstances. People sometimes wonder, for example, if it would have\nbeen wrong to break certain promises that they in fact kept. Examples\nlike this do not exhaust the significance of possibility\u2014or\nmodality more generally\u2014in our ethical thinking. Rather, we also\nseem to be committed to a certain modal structure in our ethical\ncommitments. To see this, consider an example. Suppose that a bank\nmanager wrongfully embezzles their client\u2019s money. If we imagine\nholding fixed how much the bank manager stole, and how; the trust\ntheir customers placed in them; what they did with the money; all of\nthe short- and long-term consequences of their actions; and so on, it\nseems that there could not be a second action that perfectly resembled\nthis embezzlement, except that the second action was right rather than\nwrong. Cases like this one seem to show a necessary\nconnection: they suggest that the ethical character of the bank\nmanager\u2019s act cannot vary without some other facts varying as\nwell.\n\nWhile the embezzling bank manager example concerns a specific\nnecessary connection, many philosophers also find it plausible that\nthere are general necessary connections between ethical\nproperties and certain other properties. For example, many\nphilosophers have been inclined to accept:\n\nInitial\n\nThere can be no ethical difference between two possible states of\naffairs or actions without there being some natural difference between\nthem.\n\n\nFollowing R. M. Hare (1952), claims of such general necessary\nconnection are called ethical supervenience theses. Such\ntheses have played a key role in arguments for and against a variety\nof influential views about ethics. This entry aims to introduce the\nidea of ethical supervenience and its philosophical significance. The\nentry considers ways of making more precise the claim that the ethical\nsupervenes, and what case can be made for the supervenience of the\nethical. It then considers arguments that use ethical supervenience as\na premise, and doubts that ethical supervenience has the sort of\nsignificance suggested by these arguments.\n",
