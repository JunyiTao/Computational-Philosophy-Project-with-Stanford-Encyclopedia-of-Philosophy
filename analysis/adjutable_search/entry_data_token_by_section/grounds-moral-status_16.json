    "main_text": "Grounds of Moral Status || Other Grounds\n6. Justifying the Grounds of Moral Status\n\nThe survey in section 5 of the various proposed grounds of moral\nstatus largely sidestepped the question of why the proposed\ngrounds can play their purported role in grounding moral status. What\nis so special about these grounds that they can confer special status\non their possessors? For most of the proposed grounds this issue is\nnot addressed in the literature. However, this issue is addressed\nextensively by some views that take sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities, especially the capacity for autonomy, to ground FMS, and\nalso by some views that take rudimentary cognitive capacities, such as\nsentience, to ground some moral status. So these are the views we will\nbriefly summarize here.\n\nAuthors working within the Kantian tradition have elaborated and\ndefended various versions of the claim that autonomy, or the capacity\nto set ends according to reason, is unconditionally valuable and the\nultimate condition of value of everything else (see the entry on\n autonomy in moral and political philosophy,\n sections 2 and 2.1). Numerous variants of the argument for this claim\ncan be found in the literature, and the most prominent ones take the\ntranscendental form (see the entry on\n transcendental arguments,\n section 5). On one version, in rationally choosing or valuing\nanything at all one must presuppose the supreme value of one\u2019s\nown rational capacities, and, by extension, the supreme value of\nrational capacities in general (Korsgaard 1996a and 1996b). On this\npicture, rational agents must recognize the supreme value of rational\ncapacities as a condition of valuing anything else, and this\nrecognition takes the form of affording FMS to beings with rational\ncapacities. This argument has spawned numerous responses from both\ncritics and proponents. For critiques, see, for example, Regan (2002)\nand Bukoski (2018). For alternative defenses and responses on the\nKantians\u2019 behalf, see Sussman (2003).\n\nSome philosophers have attempted to establish that the capacity to\nvalue confers special status on those who have it due to its\ninstrumental usefulness. For example, Buss (2012) traces the value of\nthis capacity to the value of non-instrumentally valuable things\n(e.g., works of art, beautiful landscapes, animal species) that must\nbe valued (appreciated for their value) in order to be given\n\u201ctheir due\u201d (p. 350, see also p. 358). She claims that\nthough the capacity is merely instrumental, and that beings with this\ncapacity are \u201cvery special instruments\u201d (p. 347, see also\np. 353), nevertheless such beings are to be treated with \u201cawe\nadmiration, and deference\u201d (p. 347) and not merely as a means to\nan end (p. 349). This view is incomplete without an explanation of why\nhuman beings qua instruments ought to be treated with the deference\nowed to what they appreciate (p. 353), given that we do not generally\nhold instruments in the high regard that we hold what they are\nfor.\n\nThere are also those who, inspired by the ancient Greek tradition,\nturn to the \u201cgood for\u201d relation as the underpinning of all\nvalue to defend the claim that the capacity to value confers special\nstatus on those who have it. According to Theunissen (2020), whatever\nis genuinely good for human beings is of value in the sense that it\ngenerates reasons to act accordingly. The capacity to value is good\nfor human beings (is beneficial to them regardless of anyone\u2019s\nattitude or opinion about it) and that explains this capacity\u2019s\nspecial value (p. 127). A daunting challenge for this view is to\nexplain \u2013 without slipping into circularity by claiming that\nhumans have a special moral status \u2013 why the \u201cX is good\nfor humans\u201d relation confers value on X while, in general, the\n\u201cZ is good for Y\u201d relation (e.g., a rabbit is good for\nitself) does not confer analogous value on Z.\n\nContractualist conceptions of morality attempt to derive all of\nmorality, together with full moral status of individuals, from a\nhypothetical reciprocal agreement (entered into under conditions\nspecified variously by different versions) among rational agents (see\nthe entry on\n contractualism).\n The claim is that all able parties would agree (make a contract) to\nbe bound and to bind others to treat them in the agreed-upon ways\n(that encompass FMS). These views work well to explain why the\ncapacity to enter and adhere to such a reciprocal agreement, which\nincludes the capacity to both demand moral status for oneself and to\nrespect the moral status of others by assuming duties and\nresponsibilities, would confer FMS on an individual.\n\nRelated views, such as Gilbert\u2019s (2018), explain the normativity\nof agreements by interpreting them as joint commitments and ground\nrights in actual joint commitment. These views also offer a ready\nexplanation of why those deemed to have the rights do have them, but\nthey do not correlate rights with capacities. If such views were to\nground rights in hypothetical joint commitments, they could explain\nwhy those possessing the sophisticated cognitive capacities required\nto make joint commitments would have the rights.\n\nMore generally, on views that conceive of morality as at least partly\noriginating from rational agents actively binding, obligating, or\nimposing authority on one another, it is easy to see why those with\nsufficient cognitive capacity to impose their authority on others\nwould have FMS that others are bound to respect. For example, Quinn\n(1984) speaks of a \u201cpicture of morality as a nexus of\nindependent spheres of authority to permit, forbid, and require\u201d\n(49) and, because he sees the capacity to will as sufficient for such\nauthority, it is also sufficient for FMS.\n\nUtilitarians and those sympathetic to utilitarian approaches often see\nthe protection and promotion of interests, where this is understood to\npresuppose consciousness, as the central subject matter of morality\n(e.g., DeGrazia 1996, p. 39). On such views it is straightforward why\nthe capacity to have interests is crucial to having any moral status\nat all. On some views, the capacity to experience pleasure or pain\n(sentience) is a prerequisite of having interests and this explains\nwhy sentience is a ground of moral status (Singer 1993, p. 57).\nEnvironmentalists, unlike Utilitarians, do not assume consciousness is\na necessary condition for having interests and hence use the term in a\nbroader fashion. However, they do not explain why interests, broadly\nconstrued in this way, give rise to moral status.\n",
