    "main_text": "Principles and Theories || Coherentist or Foundationalist?\n2.3 Coherentist or Foundationalist?\n\nA commonsense form of justification is inferential and\nlinear. It is inferential because each belief is justified by\nanother, and it is linear because beliefs cannot justify any of their\nantecedent beliefs. A is justified by B, which is justified by C, and\nso on. The problem with such inferential and linear justification is\nthat it falls into infinite regress. For anything to be justified at\nall, it seems we have to give an endless chain of justification that\nwe cannot possibly proffer. The regress can be ended either by\npermitting non-inferential justification, as foundationalism\nproposes, or by permitting non-linear justification, as\ncoherentism proposes (Brink 1989: 105\u2013106). Some have\ninterpreted reflective equilibrium as foundationalist, but most\ninterpret it as coherentist.\n\nSupport for the foundationalist interpretation comes from considered\njudgments\u2019 clear justificatory role in reflective equilibrium.\nAll justification in reflective equilibrium relies on the\ndeliberator\u2019s actual considered judgments. The most powerful\nprinciple or elegantly coherent theory must be rejected if they do not\nagree with judgment. Principles and theories have no influence on the\nprocess except through the medium of considered judgments\u2014if the\ndeliberator is not won around to them, they do not move the\nequilibrium one iota. For the foundationalist, a judgment does not\nneed to prove itself as a principle or theory does. The mere fact that\nthe deliberator holds it is enough for it to guide equilibrium. That\nsaid, the kind of foundationalism at hand is clearly rather modest\n(Ebertz 1993; Cath 2016: 219\u2013220). Judgments are treated as\nrevisable even where they are viewed as empirical data (Floyd 2017).\nThe method, at least in its usual, wide form, gives no place to the\nunrevisable beliefs of traditional foundationalism or intuitionism\n(DePaul 1993: 34).\n\nThe prevalence of the coherentist interpretation is, in part, based on\nthe obvious contrast with this traditional foundationalism. Wide\nreflective equilibrium is, furthermore, an exemplar of the broadly\ncoherentist idea that beliefs can be justified by their coherence with\na system of beliefs (Rawls 1974: 8; Daniels 1996: 60\u201361; Tersman\n2008: 398\u2013400). The deliberator is not expected to consider a\nprinciple in isolation, but rather to consider its connections with\nother principles as well as a wide range of moral and non-moral\nbackground theories. A principle can be justified by its fit with a\ncomprehensive system of thought exhibiting logical, probabilistic, and\nexplanatory relations among its members (Brink 1989: 103). For\nexample, and as we have seen, Rawls\u2019 theory of justice justifies\nits principles of justice by appeal to theories of the person and of\nmorality, among other background theories. Coherentists claim that\nmoral beliefs alone are not enough for reflective equilibrium; they\nrely on theory-grounded second-order beliefs about the reliability of\nfirst order beliefs (Brink 1989: 127; Tersman 2008: 399).\n",
