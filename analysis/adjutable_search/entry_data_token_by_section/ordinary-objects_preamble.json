    "main_text": "\n\nOur everyday experiences present us with a wide array of objects: dogs\nand cats, tables and chairs, trees and their branches, and so forth.\nThese sorts of ordinary objects may seem fairly unproblematic in\ncomparison to entities like numbers, propositions, tropes, holes,\npoints of space, and moments of time. Yet, on closer inspection, they\nare at least as puzzling, if not more so.\n\nThis entry concerns a variety of problems that arise in connection\nwith ordinary material objects. Proposed solutions to the problems, as\nwe shall see, almost invariably have one of three unpalatable\nconsequences. First, overpopulating the world with things that seem\nnot to be there, be it too many tables, or too many things in one\nplace, or too many causes of the same events, or a plenitude of\nobjects with extraordinary mereological or modal profiles. Second,\nunpalatable arbitrariness, be it arbitrariness concerning which kinds\nof objects there are, which objects do and don\u2019t belong to a\ngiven kind, which modal profiles are instantiated by which objects, or\nwhich objects together compose a further object. Third, unpalatable\nindeterminacies, be it indeterminate truth values, indeterminate\nidentities, ontic indeterminacy, or existential indeterminacy. For\nthis reason, some view the problems as constituting a powerful case\nfor the elimination of the ordinary objects that give rise to\nthem in the first place.\n\nSection 1 articulates a variety of ways of departing from an ordinary,\nconservative conception of which objects there are, either by\neliminating ordinary objects or by permitting more objects than we\nwould ordinarily take to exist. Section 2 examines the puzzles and\narguments that are meant to motivate these departures. Section 3\nexamines some arguments against eliminative and permissive views.\nFinally, Section 4, turns from the question of which objects exist to\nthe question of which objects exist fundamentally.\n",
