Michael Josef Fesl\n(1788\u20131864) and Franz P\u0159\u00edhonsk\u00fd\n(1788\u20131859) were Bolzano\u2019s closest collaborators in many\ncases and responsible for the edition of his writings (which Bolzano\ncould not himself publish due to the ban of publication hanging over\nhis head). They wrote in addition various works (introductions to\neditions of works, reviews and discussions of books, and replies to\nunfavorable reviews), for which Bolzano himself often provided the\noutline. Only Robert Zimmermann (1824\u20131898), whom Bolzano had\nprivately taught philosophy and mathematics, had a career as a\nprofessional philosopher. In 1859 he was called, under Minister Thun,\nto the philosophical chair of the University of Vienna, which he took\nup in 1861. (Franz Brentano became his colleague there.) Zimmermann\nwas, however, mainly concerned with aesthetics and turned more and\nmore away from Bolzano\u2019s philosophy to Herbart\u2019s. \n",
