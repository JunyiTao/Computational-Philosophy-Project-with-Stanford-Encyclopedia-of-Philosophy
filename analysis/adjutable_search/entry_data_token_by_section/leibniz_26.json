It is also\nLeibniz's contention that human beings are capable of knowledge\nin a way that Locke had clearly denied. As shown above, Leibniz is\nconvinced that our knowledge of necessary truths has a completely\ndifferent foundation from that for which Locke argues. Similarly,\nLeibniz holds that we can have genuine knowledge of the real essences\nof things, something called into question by Locke. After all, Locke\nhad argued that we ought to admit that \u201cessence\u201d is really\njust a word that we use to describe \u201cnominal essence,\u201d a\nset of sortal concepts based upon sensible qualities; we ought not to\nact as if \u201cessence\u201d means anything about the real or inner\nconstitution of a thing, for we will remain ignorant of that. Leibniz,\nhowever, holds that we can know certain things not only about\nindividuals but also about their species and genera. In Book IV of the\nNew Essays, in which Philalethes \u2013 the Locke character\n\u2013 gives his critique of the possibility of our certain knowledge\nabout substances qua natural kinds, Theophilus (Leibniz) says,\n\u201c[L]et me tell you that there are, for example, hundreds of\ntruths that we can be certain of concerning gold, i.e. that body whose\ninner essence reveals itself through the greatest weight known here on\nearth, or through the greatest ductility or by other marks. For we can\nsay that the body with the greatest known ductility is also the\nheaviest of all known bodies\u201d (A VI vi 400/RB 400). Earlier in\nthe New Essays, Leibniz had said that \u201cessence is\nfundamentally nothing but the possibility of the thing under\nconsideration\u201d (A VI vi 293/RB 293) and \u201cessences are\neverlasting because they only concern possibilities\u201d (A VI vi\n296/RB 296). It would seem, then, that Leibniz has something like the\nfollowing in mind: experience informs us of a certain consistent set of\nsensible properties in, for example, gold; that is, a certain set of\nproperties is compossible. And, more important, we ought to be\nable to assert with certainty that if some object has the greatest\nductility, then it also has the greatest weight.\n",
