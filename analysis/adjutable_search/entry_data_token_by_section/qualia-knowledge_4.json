    "main_text": "Some Clarifications || Knowing what it is like\n3.3 Knowing what it is like\n\nIt is common to formulate Mary\u2019s new knowledge in terms of Thomas\nNagel\u2019s famous locution of knowing what it\u2019s like: Mary does not know\n(while living in her black-and-white environment) what it is like to\nsee colors and she learns what it is like to see colors only after her\nrelease. But this common way to put the point may lead to a confusion\nof (a) mere acquaintance with kinds of color experiences by having and\nremembering them and (b) knowledge about what kind of color experience\nother subjects have at a given occasion, and it may thereby lead to a\nfailure to distinguish two steps of epistemic progress that Jackson\u2019s\nMary takes at once. To see the two steps involved one may consider an\nexample used in Nida-R\u00fcmelin (1996) and (1998): Like Mary,\nMarianna first (at t1) lives in a black and white\nenvironment. Contrary to Mary (at a later moment\nt2) she gets acquainted with colors by seeing\narbitrarily colored objects (abstract paintings, red chairs, blue\ntables, etc. but no yellow bananas, no pictures of landscapes with a\nblue sky etc.). Marianna is therefore unable to relate the kinds of\ncolor experiences she now is acquainted with to what she already knew\nabout them at t1. At t2,\nMarianna may wonder which of four slides (a red, a blue, a green and a\nyellow slide) appears to her in the color normal people experience\nwhen looking at the cloudless sky. At t2 Marianna\nknows, in a sense, what it is like to have experiences of red, blue,\netc. But she still lacks the relevant items of knowledge about what\nother people experience: there is a clear sense in which she still may\nnot know that the sky appears blue to normal perceivers, she\nmay even have the false belief that it appears to normal perceivers\nlike the red slide appears to her and thus believe, in a sense, that\nthe sky appears red to normal perceivers. Only at\nt3, when Marianna is finally released and sees the\nsky, does she gain this item of knowledge. One way to describe the two\nsteps of epistemic progress is this: At t2, by\nhaving color experiences, Marianna can form new concepts, she now has\nwhat has been called \u2018phenomenal concepts\u2019 of kinds of\ncolor experiences. By acquiring these concepts she acquires the\ncapacity to ask new questions, and to form new (eventually false)\nhypotheses (e.g. about the appearance of the sky to normal\nperceivers). Only at t3 does she acquire the kind\nof knowledge that the knowledge argument is concerned with (knowledge\nthat involves the application of phenomenal concepts) about\nexperiences of other people.\n\nOnce these two steps are clearly distinguished one may conclude that\nMarianna\u2019s relevant epistemic progress at t3 (and\nMary\u2019s relevant progress after release) is not happily described by\ntalk of knowing what it\u2019s like. Rather, or so one may argue, Mary and\nMarianna acquire a particular kind of belief that the sky\nappears blue to normal perceivers, namely the phenomenal belief that\nit appears blue to normal perceivers, where phenomenal belief involves\nthe application of the appropriate phenomenal concept. Both may have\nbelieved, in a sense (the non-phenomenal sense that does not require\nuse of phenomenal concepts) that the sky appears blue to normal\nperceivers while still in their black-and-white environment (they may\nhave been told so by their friends). (For the distinction between\nphenomenal and non-phenomenal belief see Nida-Rumelin 1996 and\n1998).\n",
