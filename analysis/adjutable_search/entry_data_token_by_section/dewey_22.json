    "main_text": "Philosophy of Education || Traditionalists, Romantics, and Dewey\n5.2 Traditionalists, Romantics, and Dewey\n\nDewey\u2019s educational philosophy emerged amidst a fierce\n1890\u2019s debate between educational \u201cromantics\u201d and\n\u201ctraditionalists\u201d. Romantics (also called\n\u201cNew\u201d or \u201cProgressive\u201d education by Dewey),\nurged a \u201cchild-centered\u201d approach; they claimed that the\nchild\u2019s natural impulses provided education\u2019s proper\nstarting point. As active and creative beings, education should not\nfetter growth\u2014even instruction should be subordinated to content\nif necessary. Traditionalists (called \u201cOld\u201d\neducation by Dewey) pressed for a \u201ccurriculum-centered\u201d\napproach. Children were empty cabinets which curriculum fills with\ncivilization\u2019s lessons. Content was supreme, and instruction\nshould discipline children to ensure they are receptive.\n\nIn many articles and books (\u201cMy Pedagogic Creed\u201d, 1897b,\nEW5; The School and Society, 1899, MW1; Democracy and\nEducation, 1916b, MW9; Experience and Education, 1938b,\nLW13, etc.) Dewey developed an interactional model to move beyond that\ndebate. He refused to privilege either child or society. While\nRomantics correctly identified the child (replete with instincts,\npowers, habits, and histories) as an indispensable starting point for\npedagogy, Dewey argued that the child cannot be the only\nstarting point. Larger social groups (family, community, nation) also\nhave a legitimate stake in passing along extant interests, needs, and\nvalues as part of an educational synthesis.\n\nStill, of these two approaches, Dewey tilted more strongly against the\nhigh value placed by traditionalists on discipline and memorization.\nWhile recognizing the legitimacy of conveying content (facts, values),\nDewey thought it paramount for schools to eschew indoctrination.\nEducating meant incorporating, with a wide berth for personal\nfreedom, unique individuals into a changing society which\u2014this\nhad to remain clear\u2014would soon be under their dominion.\nThis is why who the child was mattered so very much.\nFollowing colleague and lifelong friend G.H. Mead, Dewey argued that\nany child\u2019s \u201cself\u201d was an emerging construct of\nsocial and personal experiences, so no child\u2019s deeds, words, or\ninterests could be isolated from their social context.\nInsofar as these were facts of social psychology, schools had to\nbecome micro-communities to best reflect children\u2019s growing\ninterests and needs. \u201cThe school cannot be a preparation for\nsocial life excepting as it reproduces, within itself, the typical\nconditions of social life\u201d (\u201cEthical Principles Underlying\nEducation\u201d, 1897a, EW5:\n 61\u201362).[33]\n",
