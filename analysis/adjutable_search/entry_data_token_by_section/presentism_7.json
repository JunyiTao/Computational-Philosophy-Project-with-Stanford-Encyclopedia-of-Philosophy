    "main_text": "Cross-Temporal Relations\n4. Cross-Temporal Relations\n\nPrima facie, there are myriad \u201ccross-temporal\u201d\nrelations. We admire Marie Curie; admiration is a\nrelation. Yesterday\u2019s rain caused today\u2019s flood; causation\nis a relation. There are other kinds of relation, which we discuss\nbelow, such as directly referring and truth-making, which seem like\nthey cross times (and as if they might cause special trouble for\npresentism). For now though we want to consider the point very\ngenerally. Presentism is not compatible with the existence of Marie\nCurie or yesterday\u2019s rainfall; presentism denies the existence\nof all past entities. Nonetheless, what we have here with admiration\nand causation seems to be a relation. It\u2019s very natural and very\nreasonable to suppose that a relation can only be instantiated if all\nof its relata exist: x cannot stand in a relation R\nto y unless both x and y exist. If that\u2019s\nright, then there\u2019s an obvious worry. Presentism seems flat out\nincompatible with the existence of any and all cross-temporal\nrelations. Something must give.\n\nA famous statement of this \u201cargument from relations\u201d is\ndue to John Bigelow (1996). It goes as follows:\n\n\n\u2026in order for a relation to hold between two things, both of\nthose two things will have to exist. Call this the principle that all\nrelations are existence entailing. Add as a further premise the\nsupposition that relations sometimes hold between a present thing and\nsomething else which is not present. The conclusion follows\nineluctably, that some things exist which are not present. (1996:\n37)\n\n\nBigelow suggests that this argument goes as far back as the Stoics and\nEpicureans. Here we focus on contemporary iterations of the problem.\nFor recent discussion of the problem, in a variety of forms, see Adams\n(1986: 321\u20138), Quine (1987: 197\u20138), Chisholm (1990a,b),\nBigelow (1996), Sider (1999, 2001: 25\u201335), Craig (2000:\n211\u20132), Davidson (2003), Markosian (2004), Crisp (2005),\nBrogaard (2006, 2013), De Clercq (2006), Torrengo (2006, 2010), Inman\n(2012), Ciuni & Torrengo (2013), and Ingthorsson (2019). For a\nsubstantial, book-length treatment of the issue, see Torrengo\n(2008).\n\nQuite generally, presentism can be defended via one of a few\nstrategies to address this worry about \u201ccross-time\u201d\nrelations. One option: to use presently existing entities to make\nsense of the relational claims. With our admiration of Marie Curie,\nfor example, this amounts to saying that: when she existed, Curie\ninstantiated various features and properties, those properties still\nexist, and it\u2019s those present properties that we\u2019re\nrelated to in admiration. Thus, it\u2019s not Curie herself that we\nadmire, but her perseverance, insight and brilliance. Of course, one\nimportant issue with this strategy is that it fails to respect the\nidea that it\u2019s Curie herself that we admire, rather than mere\nproperties that she exemplified. Alternatively, then, alongside\ndefending presentism we might deny that some or all relations are\n\u201cexistence-entailing\u201d. Thus, we can stand in the relation\nof admiration to Marie Curie herself, even though there\u2019s no\nsuch entity as Curie. But here we would face the difficult task of\ndenying the natural and reasonable supposition that a relation can\nonly be instantiated if all of its relata exist. Presentists who go\nthis route deny \u201cserious presentism\u201d and start down the\nroad towards Meinongianism, a position which many find quite\nundesirable (see the entry on\n nonexistent objects,\n esp. \u00a74). Serious presentism is the temporal analogue of\n\u201cserious actualism\u201d, the view that \u201cnecessarily, if\nx has F or bears R, then x\nexists\u201d (see the entry on the\n possibilism-actualism debate,\n esp. \u00a74.1). (We remain neutral on the question of whether\npresentism implies serious presentism, pace Bergmann 1999,\nDavidson 2000, and leave the \u201cnon-serious\u201d option open to\npresentists.) There\u2019s at least one more option open: to say that\nsuch seeming cases of relations aren\u2019t, in fact, relational at\nall. Thus, rather than our admiration of Curie being a state that\nconsists in Curie existing, our existing, and our bearing a relation\nto Curie, all that there is to such a state is our existing and\ninstantiating a monadic property, admiring Marie Curie. Since\nthe property is monadic, its instantiation requires only our\nexistence.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there are questions about the advisability of each\nstrategy, in general, as well as about whether each can be pursued or\napplied sensibly in defense of presentism. Nonetheless, with the above\ngeneral overview in hand, we now turn our attention to two\nphilosophical problems that confront presentism: the problem of\nreference to non-present entities (\u00a75) and the\n\u201ctruth-maker\u201d problem (\u00a76). Both are specific\ninstances of our main objection, introduced above, and both present\nspecial problems for presentists. (The well-informed reader will note\nthat we haven\u2019t yet mentioned explicitly problems concerning\nquantification across times or metric tensed statements. We consider\nboth as part of\n \u00a76.)\n",
