    "main_text": "Convergence to the Truth and Nothing But the Truth || Simple Universal Generalization\n1.1 Simple Universal Generalization\n\nLet\u2019s revisit the classic question of whether all ravens are\nblack. Imagine an ornithologist who tackles this problem by examining\none raven after another. There is exactly one observation sequence in\nwhich only black ravens are found; all others feature at least one\nnonblack raven. The figure below illustrates the possible observation\nsequences. Dots in the figure denote points at which an observation\nmay be made. A black bird to the left of a dot indicates that at this\nstage, a black raven is observed. Similarly, a white bird to the right\nof a dot indicates that a nonblack raven is observed. Given a \ncomplete sequence  of observations, either all observed ravens are\nblack or nonblack; the figure labels complete observation sequences\nwith the statement that is true of them. The gray fan indicates that\nafter the observation of a white raven, the claim that not all ravens\nare black holds on all observation sequences resulting from further\nobservations.\n\n\nFigure 1 [An extended description of figure 1 is in a supplement.]\n\n\nIf the world is such that only black ravens are found, we would like\nthe ornithologist to settle on this generalization. (It may be\npossible that some nonblack ravens remain forever hidden from sight,\nbut even then the generalization \u201call ravens are black\u201d at\nleast gets the observations right.) If the world is such that\neventually a nonblack raven is found, then we would like the\nornithologist to arrive at the conclusion that not all ravens are\nblack. This specifies a set of goals of inquiry. For any given\ninductive method that might represent the ornithologist\u2019s\ndisposition to adopt conjectures in the light of the evidence, we can\nask whether that method measures up to these goals or not. There are\ninfinitely many possible methods to consider; we\u2019ll look at just\ntwo, a skeptical one and one that boldly generalizes. The  bold\nmethod  conjectures that all ravens are black after seeing that\nthe first raven is black. It hangs on to this conjecture unless some\nnonblack raven appears. The skeptical method does not go beyond what\nis entailed by the evidence. So if a nonblack raven is found, the\nskeptical method concludes that not all ravens are black, but\notherwise the method does not make a conjecture one way or another.\nThe figure below illustrates both the bold and the skeptical\nmethod.\n\n\nFigure 2 [An extended description of figure 2 is in a supplement.]\n\n\nDo these methods attain the goals we set out? Consider the bold\nmethod. There are two possibilities: either all observed ravens are\nblack, or some nonblack raven is found. In the first case, the method\nconjectures that all ravens are black and never abandons this\nconjecture. In the second case, the method concludes that not all\nravens are black as soon as the first nonblack raven is found. Hence\nno matter how the evidence comes in, eventually the method\ngives the right answer as to whether all ravens are black and\nsticks with this answer. Learning theorists call such methods\nreliable because they settle on the right answer no matter\nwhat observations the world provides.\n\nThe skeptical method does not measure up so well. If a nonblack raven\nappears, then the method does arrive at the correct conclusion that\nnot all ravens are black. But if all ravens are black, the skeptic\nnever takes an \u201cinductive leap\u201d to adopt this\ngeneralization. So in that case, the skeptic fails to provide the\nright answer to the question of whether all ravens are black.\n\nThis illustrates how means-ends analysis can evaluate methods: the\nbold method meets the goal of reliably arriving at the right answer,\nwhereas the skeptical method does not. Note the character of this\nargument against the skeptic: The problem, in this view, is not that\nthe skeptic violates some canon of rationality, or fails to appreciate\nthe\n \u201c uniformity of nature\u201d.\n The learning-theoretic analysis concedes to the skeptic that no\nmatter how many black ravens have been observed in the past, the next\none could be white. The issue is that if all observed ravens are\nindeed black, then the skeptic never answers the question\n\u201care all ravens black?\u201d. Getting the right answer to that\nquestion requires generalizing from the evidence even though\nthe generalization could be wrong.\n\nAs for the bold method, it\u2019s important to be clear on what it\ndoes and does not achieve. The method will eventually settle on the\nright answer\u2014but it (or we) may never be certain that\nit has done so. As\n William James\n put it, \u201cno bell tolls\u201d when science has found the right\nanswer. We are certain that the method will eventually settle on the\nright answer; but we may never be certain that the current answer is\nthe right one. This is a subtle point; the next example illustrates it\nfurther.\n",
