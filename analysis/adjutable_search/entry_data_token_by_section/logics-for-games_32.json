    "main_text": "Interfacing Logic and Probability in Games\n5. Interfacing Logic and Probability in Games\n\nProbabilities are central to game theory, where they serve two\nprominent roles. First, they structure players\u2019 uncertainty\nabout various aspects of the game, including the state of nature, the\ntype of opponent faced, and past, present, and future moves of other\nplayers. Second, ever since the origins of Game Theory (von\nNeumann & Morgenstern 1944),\nprobabilistic randomization has served to expand the agents\u2019\nspace of possible actions. While the interpretation of such mixed\nstrategies has been the subject of extensive debate (Sugden\n1991), it is uncontroversial that\nrandomized moves add significant depth to the analysis of games. In\nfact, the concept of mixed strategies is vital for a number of seminal\nresults in classic game theory including the existence of Nash\nequilibria in finite games of imperfect information.\n\nProbability and its logic is a major topic in both mathematics and\nphilosophy, as discussed in the entries on\n interpretations of probability,\n and\n logic and probability.\n The current section merely outlines a few key connections between\nprobability and the logical analysis of games. The following\npresentation assumes all state spaces to be finite, ignoring important\ntechnical and conceptual issues around the transition from finite to\ninfinite state spaces.\n",
