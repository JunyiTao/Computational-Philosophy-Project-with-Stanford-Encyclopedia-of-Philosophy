    "main_text": "Theory of Prophecy\n9. Theory of Prophecy\n\nUnderlying the double truth doctrine is a unique theory of prophecy\nthat credits Albalag with novelty. Deviating from the widely accepted\nconception of prophecy in medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy,\nwhich views prophets as accomplished philosophers and qualitatively\nequates prophetic knowledge with philosophy, this theory links\nprophets and prophetic knowledge to the divine realm (i.e., the realm\nof separate intellects) while at the same time stressing the absolute\ntranscendence and unknowability of that realm. It correspondingly\nstresses essential distinctions between philosophical reasoning and\nknowledge, on the one hand, and prophecy and prophetic knowledge, on\nthe other. Prophets, according to Albalag, are extraordinary human\nbeings endowed with a special mode of apprehension. Thanks to this\nmode of apprehension prophets have access to knowledge that differs\nfrom philosophical knowledge in both content and type. Not only do\nprophets arrive at answers to questions that lie beyond the capacity\nof human reason, but they also grasp the truth in a transcendent\nmanner, independently of physical tools and the cognitive processes\nnecessary for rational knowledge (Guttmann 1945: 86).\n\n\nTheir [the philosopher\u2019s and prophet\u2019s] modes of\napprehension are distinct. Not only that, but they are [like two]\nopposites, since this [the philosopher] perceives intelligible [forms]\nthrough sensory objects, whereas the latter [the prophet] perceives\nsensory objects through intelligible [forms]. (Tiqqun n.30:\n44 [my translation])\n\n\nThis note suggests that the prophetic mode of apprehension is similar\nto that of separate intellects which is described in the\nTiqqun in similar terms: \u201cif there exists a separate\nintellect in the universe whose knowledge is not obtained through\nphysical tools\u201d, its \u201cgrasp of things would be completely\nopposite to that of the human [intellect]\u201d\n(Tiqqun n.11: 16; cf. n.42: 67). The distinction in the mode\nof apprehension entails fundamental distinctions in the\ncharacteristics of the perceived knowledge. Human knowledge passes\nfrom potentiality to actuality. It is either universal or particular.\nIt is temporal and involves features of multiplicity, compositeness\nand materiality. By contrast, divine knowledge is transcendent; it is\n\u201cneither particular nor universal.\u201d It is constantly\nactual and absolutely indivisible, simple and atemporal\n(Tiqqun n.42: 67). In this way, prophetic knowledge, like\nknowledge of the separate intellects, is said to be qualitatively\ndistinct from philosophical knowledge. Radically maximizing the\ndistinction between prophecy and philosophy, Albalag emphasizes the\npossibility of contradiction. \n\n\nJust as the ways through which they [the philosopher and the prophet]\napprehend things are so distinct, their respective grasps of things\nare so distinct that it is possible for the former [the philosopher]\nto perceive from below [based on nature and reasoning] the opposite\n(hefekh) of what the latter [the prophet] perceives from\nabove. (Tiqqun n.30: 45 [my translation])\n\n\nThis theory of prophecy parts ways with the standard contemporary\ntheory of prophecy according to which prophets are accomplished\nphilosophers endowed with a strong imaginative faculty. By virtue of\nthis faculty, prophets, unlike philosophers, are able to carry out the\nnecessary political role of establishing laws conducive to the welfare\nof society, and reformulate theoretical knowledge in a language easy\nfor the multitude to understand. Whatever theoretical knowledge a\nprophet attains through emanation from the Active Intellect\u2014the\nintellect of the sphere of the moon to which philosophers variably\nascribed epistemological and ontological roles in the sublunary\nrealm\u2014accords with philosophical knowledge; the difference being\nparticularly quantitative (Macy 1986; Rahman 1958). Even the\nAvicennian theory of prophecy, which links the prophetic mind to the\ndivine realm, does not ascribe to prophetic knowledge a specific\nqualitative merit above philosophical knowledge; prophets apprehend\nthe principles of all existents, the middle term of every syllogism\nand intelligible forms instantaneously and effortlessly through divine\nintuition (\u1e25ads). (Rahman, 1958: 32; Marmura 1963:\n49\u201351; Morris 1992: 84). That is, there are no grounds for\ncontradiction, as Albalag\u2019s theory of prophecy suggests.\n",
