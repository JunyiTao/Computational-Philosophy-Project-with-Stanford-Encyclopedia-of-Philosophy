    "main_text": "Epistemology || Self-Knowledge\n3.1 Self-Knowledge\n\n\nImplicit bias is typically thought of as unconscious (\u00a72.1.1),\nbut what exactly does this mean? There are several possibilities: there\nmight be no phenomenology associated with the relevant mental states or\ndispositions; agents might be unaware of the content of the\nrepresentations underlying their performance on implicit measures, or\nthey might be unaware of the source of their implicit biases or the\neffects those biases have on their behavior; agents might be unaware of\nthe relations between their relevant states (e.g., that their implicit\nand explicit evaluations of a given target conflict); and agents might\nhave different modes of awareness of their own minds (e.g.,\n\u201caccess\u201d vs. \u201cphenomenal\u201d awareness; Block\n1995). Gawronski and colleagues (2006) argue that agents typically lack\n\u201csource\u201d and \u201cimpact\u201d awareness of their\nimplicit biases, but typically have\n\u201ccontent\u201d\n awareness.[15]\nEvidence for\ncontent awareness stems from \u201cbogus pipeline\u201d experiments\n(e.g., Nier 2005) in which participants are led to believe that\ninaccurate self-reports will be detected by the experimenter. In these\nexperiments, participants\u2019 scores on implicit and explicit\nmeasures come to be more closely correlated, suggesting that\nparticipants are aware of the content of those judgments detected by\nimplicit measures and shift their reports when they believe that the\nexperimenter will notice discrepancies. Additional evidence for content\nawareness is found in studies in which experimenters bring implicit\nmeasures and self-reports into conceptual alignment (e.g., Banse et al.\n2001) and studies in which agents are asked to predict their own\nimplicit biases (Hahn et al. 2014). Indeed, Hahn and colleagues (2014)\nand Hahn and Gawronski (2019) have found that people are good at\npredicting their own IAT scores regardless of how the test is\ndescribed, how much experience they have taking the test, and how much\nexplanation they are given about the test before taking it. Moreover,\npeople have unique insight into how they will do on the test, insight\nwhich is not explained by their beliefs about how people in general\nwill perform.\n\n\nHahn and colleagues\u2019 data do not determine, however, whether\nagents come to be aware of the content of their implicit biases through\nintrospection, by drawing inferences from their own behavior, or from\nsome other source (see Berger forthcoming for discussion). This is important\nfor determining whether the awareness agents have of their implicit\nbiases constitutes self-knowledge. If our awareness of the content of\nour implicit biases derives from inferences we make based on (for\nexample) our behavior, then the question is whether these inferences\nare justified, assuming knowledge entails justified true belief. Some\nhave suggested that the facts about implicit bias warrant a\n\u201cglobal\u201d skepticism toward our capacities as epistemic\nagents (Saul 2012; see\n \u00a73.2.2).\nIf this is\nright, then we ought to worry that our inferences about the content of\nour implicit biases, from all the ways we behave on a day-to-day basis,\nare likely to be unjustified. Others, however, have argued that people\nare typically very good interpreters of their own minds (e.g.,\nCarruthers 2009; Levy 2012), in which case it may be more likely that\nour inferences about the content of our implicit biases are\nwell-justified. But whether the inferences we make about our own minds\nare well-justified would be moot if it were shown that we have direct\nintrospective access to our biases.\n",
