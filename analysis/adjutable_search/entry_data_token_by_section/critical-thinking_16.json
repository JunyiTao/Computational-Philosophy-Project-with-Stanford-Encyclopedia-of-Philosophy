    "main_text": "Educational methods\n11. Educational methods\n\nExperimental educational interventions, with control groups, have\nshown that education can improve critical thinking skills and\ndispositions, as measured by standardized tests. For information about\nthese tests, see the\n Supplement on Assessment.\n\nWhat educational methods are most effective at developing the\ndispositions, abilities and knowledge of a critical thinker? In a\ncomprehensive meta-analysis of experimental and quasi-experimental\nstudies of strategies for teaching students to think critically,\nAbrami et al. (2015) found that dialogue, anchored instruction, and\nmentoring each increased the effectiveness of the educational\nintervention, and that they were most effective when combined. They\nalso found that in these studies a combination of separate instruction\nin critical thinking with subject-matter instruction in which students\nare encouraged to think critically was more effective than either by\nitself. However, the difference was not statistically significant;\nthat is, it might have arisen by chance.\n\nMost of these studies lack the longitudinal follow-up required to\ndetermine whether the observed differential improvements in critical\nthinking abilities or dispositions continue over time, for example\nuntil high school or college graduation. For details on studies of\nmethods of developing critical thinking skills and dispositions, see\nthe\n Supplement on Educational Methods.\n",
