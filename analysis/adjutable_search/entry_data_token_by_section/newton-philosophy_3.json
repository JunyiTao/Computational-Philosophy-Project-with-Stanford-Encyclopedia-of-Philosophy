Methodology II: the Principia\n\nMany legends concerning momentous events in history are apocryphal,\nbut the legend of Halley\u2019s visit to Newton in 1684 is not: it\nexplains what prompted Newton to write his magnum opus. In\nAugust of 1684, Edmond Halley\u2014for whom the comet is\nnamed\u2014came to visit Newton in Cambridge in order to discover his\nopinion about a subject of much dispute in celestial mechanics. At\nthis time, many in the Royal Society and elsewhere were at work on a\ncluster of problems that might be described as follows: how can one\ntake Kepler\u2019s Laws, which were then considered among the very\nbest descriptions of the planetary orbits, and understand them in the\ncontext of dynamical or causal principles? What kind of cause would\nlead to planetary orbits of the kind described by Kepler? In\nparticular, Halley asked Newton the following question: what kind of\ncurve would a planet describe in its orbit around the Sun if it were\nacted upon by an attractive force that was inversely proportional to\nthe square of its distance from the Sun? Newton immediately replied\nthat the curve would be an ellipse (rather than, say, a\n circle).[17]\n Halley was amazed that Newton had the answer at the ready. But Newton\nalso said that he had mislaid the paper on which the relevant\ncalculations had been made, so Halley left empty handed (whether there\nwas any such paper is a subject of dispute). But he would not be\ndisappointed for long. In November of that year, Newton sent Halley a\nnine-page paper, entitled De Motu (on motion), that presented\nthe sought-after demonstration, along with several other advances in\ncelestial mechanics. Halley was delighted, and immediately returned to\nCambridge for further discussion. It was these events that\nprecipitated the many drafts of De Motu that eventually\nbecame Principia mathematica by 1686. Several aspects of the\nPrincipia have been central to philosophical discussions\nsince its first publication, including Newton\u2019s novel\nmethodology in the book, his conception of space and time, and his\nattitude toward the dominant orientation within natural philosophy in\nhis day, the so-called mechanical philosophy, which had important\nmethodological consequences.\n\nWhen Newton wrote the Principia between 1684 and 1686, he was\nnot contributing to a preexisting field of study called mathematical\nphysics; he was attempting to show how philosophers could employ\nvarious mathematical and experimental methods in order to reach\nconclusions about nature, especially about the motions of material\nbodies (Janiak 2015, Chapter One). In his lectures presented as the\nLucasian Professor at Cambridge, Newton had been arguing since at\nleast 1670 that natural philosophers ought to employ geometrical\nmethods in order to understand various phenomena in\n nature.[18]\n The Principia represented his attempt to reorient natural\nphilosophy, taking it in a direction that neither his Aristotelian\npredecessors, nor his Cartesian contemporaries, had envisioned. He did\nnot immediately convince many of them of the benefits of his approach.\nJust as his first publication in optics in 1672 sparked an intense\ndebate about the proper methods for investigating the nature of\nlight\u2014and much else besides\u2014his Principia sparked\nan even longer lasting discussion about the methodology that\nphilosophers should adopt when studying the natural world. This\ndiscussion began immediately with the publication of the\nPrincipia, despite the fact that its first edition contained\nfew explicit methodological remarks (Smith 2002: 138\u201339). It\nintensified considerably with the publication of its second edition in\n1713, which contained many more remarks about methodology, including\nmany attempts at defending the Newtonian method. Indeed, many of\nNewton\u2019s alterations in that edition changed the presentation of\nhis methods. Discussions of methodology would eventually involve\nnearly all of the leading philosophers in England and on the Continent\nduring Newton\u2019s lifetime.\n\nIn Cartesian natural philosophy, all natural change is due to the\nimpacts that material bodies make upon one another\u2019s surfaces\n(this is reflected in Descartes\u2019s first two laws of nature). The\nconcept of a force plays little if any role. Unlike Descartes, Newton\nplaced the concept of a force at the very center of his thinking about\nmotion and its causes within nature. In that regard, his reactions to\nthe shortcomings of Cartesian natural philosophy parallel\nLeibniz\u2019s, who coined the term \u201cdynamics\u201d, and who\nobviously regarded force as a fundamental concept in metaphysics as\nwell (Westfall 1971). But Newton\u2019s attitude toward understanding\nthe forces of nature involved an especially intricate method that\ngenerated intense scrutiny and debate amongst many philosophers and\nmathematicians, including Leibniz (Garber 2012). Newton\u2019s\ncanonical notion of a force, which he calls a vis impressa or\n\u201cimpressed force\u201d, is the notion of an \u201caction\nexerted on a body\u201d that changes its state of motion. This was a\nconfusing notion at the time. Perhaps it is not difficult to see why\nthat should be so. To take one of Newton\u2019s own examples: suppose\nI hit a tennis ball with my racquet\u2014according to Newton, I have\nimpressed a force on the tennis ball, for I have changed its state of\nmotion (hopefully!). We have a reasonably good idea of what the tennis\nball is, of what the racquet is, and even of what I am, and a\nCartesian might wish to stop her analysis there. But what exactly is\nthis \u201cforce\u201d that I impressed on the tennis ball? The\nball, the racquet and I are physical things of one sort or another,\nbut is the force physical? Is it not physical? It does not seem likely\nthat a force is itself a physical thing in the sense of being a\nsubstance, to use a philosophical notion popular in Newton\u2019s day\n(as we saw above in his first optics paper). The reason is that in\nDefinition Four in the Principia, which defines an impressed\nforce for the first time, Newton remarks: \u201cThis force consists\nsolely in the action and does not remain in a body after the action\nhas ceased\u201d. So when I hit the tennis ball over the net, the\nforce I impressed on it was the action of hitting the ball, or an\naction associated with hitting the ball, and not a property of me or\nof the ball after the action had ceased. This idea confused many of\nNewton\u2019s readers. By the mid-eighteenth century, the time of\nHume\u2019s analysis of causation in the Treatise and the\nEnquiry, many philosophers started to think that actions and\nother kinds of event are important items to have in one\u2019s\nontology, and they often contended in particular that causal relations\nhold between events. But in Newton\u2019s day, philosophers\ntypically regarded objects or substances as the causal relata. Indeed,\none actually finds an equivocation between thinking of events and\nthinking of objects as the relevant causal relata even in Hume: in his\nEnquiry, he first defines a \u201ccause\u201d so that\n\u201cobjects\u201d are the causal relata, but then gives an example\nin which one of the relata is the vibration of a string\n(Enquiry, \u00a7VII, 51). So actions were difficult to\nanalyze, left out of analyses, or conflated with objects. As a result,\nNewton\u2019s conception of force proved confusing, even to his most\nsympathetic interpreters. Moreover, it was unclear to many of\nNewton\u2019s mechanist readers how his forces fit into their rather\naustere ontological view that material bodies consist solely of\nproperties such as size, shape, mobility and solidity.\n\nNewton did try to clarify his method of characterizing forces. If one\nbrackets the question of how to understand forces as ephemeral actions\nthat do not persist after causal interactions have ceased, one can\nmake progress by conceiving of forces as quantities. In\nparticular, since Newton\u2019s eight definitions and three laws\nindicate that forces are proportional to mass and to acceleration, and\nsince mass\u2014or the quantity of matter, a concept Newton\ntransformed from its Cartesian origins, where it was understood as a\nmeasure of a body\u2019s volume\u2014and acceleration are both\nquantities that can be measured, Newton gives us a means of measuring\nforces. This is crucial to his method. If one thinks of forces as\nmeasurable quantities, moreover, then one can attempt to identify two\nseemingly disparate forces as in fact the same force through thinking\nabout measuring them. For instance, in Book III of the\nPrincipia, Newton famously argues in proposition five and its\nscholium that the centripetal force maintaining the planetary orbits\nis in fact the same as the force of gravity, viz., the force that\ncauses the free fall of objects on earth. This was a revolutionary\nidea at the time, one rendered possible in the first place by\nNewton\u2019s way of thinking about forces as quantities. This idea\nthen led Newton to the even more revolutionary view in proposition\nseven of Book III that all bodies gravitate toward one another in\nproportion to their quantity of matter. That is, it led him to the\nidea of universal gravity, a view that shocked many of his Continental\nreaders in its boldness. This helped to unify what were once called\nsuperlunary and sublunary phenomena, a unification that was obviously\ncrucial for later research in physics. The idea was enabled by\nNewton\u2019s abstract way of understanding forces\u2014without\nconceiving of a force as involving any specific mechanism or type of\nphysical interaction, Newton thought of forces as quantities that are\nproportional to other features of nature.\n\nDespite his evident success in obtaining what we now call the law of\nuniversal gravitation, Newton admits that he lacks another kind of\nknowledge about gravity; this lack of knowledge directly reflects an\naspect of his abstract characterization of forces. In the General\nScholium, he reminds his readers that gravity is proportional to a\nbody\u2019s quantity of matter (its mass) and reaches across vast\ndistances within our solar system, adding: \u201cI have not as yet\nbeen able to deduce from phenomena the reason for these properties of\ngravity, and I do not feign\n hypotheses\u201d.[19]\n With this phrase, one of the most famous in all of Newton\u2019s\nwritings, he returned to a key theme of his very first optical paper\nfrom forty years earlier, viz. the proper role of hypotheses and of\nhypothetical reasoning within natural\n philosophy.[20]\n Some of Newton\u2019s interpreters have regarded this phrase as\nsignaling a strong commitment to the broad doctrine that all\nhypotheses concerning natural phenomena ought to be avoided in\nprinciple. This interpretation is sometimes coupled with the view that\nsome British philosophers in the late seventeenth century regarded\nCartesianism as overly reliant on hypotheses in reaching conclusions\nabout phenomena. But this interpretation may be hard to square with\nNewton\u2019s texts. For instance, in the Scholium to Proposition 96\nof Book I of the Principia, Newton discusses hypotheses\nconcerning light rays. Similarly, in query 21 of the Opticks,\nhe proposes that there might be an aether whose differential density\naccounts for the gravitational force acting between bodies. In light\nof such examples, one can read the General Scholium\u2019s\npronouncement in this way: a philosopher concerned with explaining\nsome feature of nature\u2014such as the fact that gravity is\ninversely proportional to the square of spatial separation,\nrather than, say, the cube\u2014may legitimately entertain\nand propose hypotheses for consideration, but she may not\n\u201cfeign\u201d the hypothesis in the sense of taking it as having\nbeen established either through experiment, observation, or some form\nof reasoning (including mathematical reasoning). Hence Newton thinks\nthat he has established the fact that gravity acts on all material\nbodies in proportion to their quantity of matter, but he has\nnot established the existence of the aether. What, then, does\nNewton\u2019s slogan hypotheses non fingo actually rule out?\nBy the time of the General Scholium, Newton was increasingly embroiled\nin philosophical disputes with Leibniz. After reading the copy of the\nPrincipia that Newton had sent him, Leibniz wrote an essay\n(\u201cTentamen\u201d) on the causes of planetary motion for the\nfamous journal Acta Eruditorum. In order to account for the\nmotions of the planetary bodies in his Tentamen, published in\n1689, Leibniz introduces ex hypothesi the premise that some\nkind of fluid surrounds, and is contiguous to, the various planetary\nbodies, and then argues that this fluid must be in motion to account\nfor their\n orbits.[21]\n Newton may have argued that Leibniz had \u201cfeigned\u201d the\nhypothesis of the vortices. That is, he would have objected to\nLeibniz\u2019s conclusion that there must be vortices in the solar\nsystem (as opposed to the suggestion, for instance, that we try to\ndetect their presence through observations of things like comets). A\ndebate between the two philosophers on this score would bring them to\nthe question of the mechanical philosophy: whereas Newton would object\nto Leibniz\u2019s reasoning on methodological grounds, Leibniz would\nreply that Newton\u2019s theory of gravity involves action at a\ndistance, which his vortex hypothesis avoids (see below for more\ndetails).\n\nOnce the Principia was published, Newton had a vexed\nrelationship with the mechanical philosophy, an orientation within\nnatural philosophy that is associated with nearly every significant\nearly modern philosopher, including Descartes, Boyle, Huygens,\nLeibniz, and\n Locke.[22]\n One of the reasons for this complex relationship can be understood if\nwe consider Newton\u2019s attitude toward forces in an abstract way.\nHis second law indicates that a body moving rectilinearly will\ncontinue to do so unless a force is impressed on it. This is not\nequivalent to claiming that a body moving rectilinearly will continue\nto do so unless another body impacts upon it. A vis\nimpressa\u2014an impressed force\u2014in Newton\u2019s system\nis not the same as a body, nor even a quality of a body, as we have\nseen; but what is more, some impressed forces need not involve contact\nbetween bodies at all. For instance, gravity is a kind of centripetal\nforce, and the latter, in turn, is a species of impressed force. Hence\na body moving in a straight line will continue to do so until it\nexperiences a gravitational pull, in which case it will deviate from a\nstraight line motion, even if no body impacts upon it. Indeed, the\ngravitational pull might originate with a mass that is millions of\nmiles away. As we have seen, an impressed force is an action exerted\non a body. Hence the gravity exerted on a moving body is an action\n(the Latin term is actio), which is obviously a causal\nnotion. This is not an empirical claim per se; it is merely a\nreflection of Newton\u2019s laws, together with his notion of an\nimpressed force, and his further idea that gravity is one kind of\nimpressed force. These elements of the Principia make\nconceptual room for a causal interaction between two bodies separated\nby a vast distance, one enabled by Newton\u2019s concept of an\nimpressed force. Aspects of this idea became known in philosophical\ncircles as the problem of action at a distance (Hesse 1961). Many of\nNewton\u2019s most influential contemporaries objected vigorously to\nthe fact that his philosophy had made room for\u2014if not explicitly\ndefended\u2014the possibility of distant action between material\nbodies. Leibniz and Huygens in particular rejected this aspect of\nNewton\u2019s work in the strongest terms, and it remained a point of\ncontention between Newton and Leibniz for the rest of their lives.\nBoth Leibniz and Huygens were convinced that all natural change occurs\nthrough contact action, and that any deviation from this basic\nmechanist principle within natural philosophy would lead to serious\ndifficulties, including the revival of outmoded Aristotelian ideas. By\nthe seventh proposition of Book III of the Principia, as we\nhave seen, Newton reached the following conclusion (1999: 810):\n\u201cGravity acts on all bodies universally and is proportional to\nthe quantity of matter in each\u201d. Leibniz eventually accused\nNewton of regarding gravity as a kind of \u201coccult quality\u201d,\nthat is, as a quality of bodies that is somehow hidden within them and\nbeyond the philosopher\u2019s understanding. They understood Newton\nto be saying that gravity is a kind of hidden power to attract\nembedded in material bodies.\n\nNewton was well aware that the Principia\u2019s methodology\nof discovering the forces present in nature was controversial, and not\nmerely because of questions about action at a distance. So when he\nrevised the text, under the editorship of Roger Cotes, for publication\nin a second edition in 1713, he added other methodological remarks.\nThese remarks included what Newton called \u201cregulae\nphilosophandi\u201d, or rules of philosophy, which became the\nfocal point of vigorous discussion and debate well into the eighteenth\ncentury. The first two rules concern causal reasoning, but it is the\nthird rule that generated the most debate, for it involved both an\naspect of Newton\u2019s controversial argument for universal gravity\nand also a rare public statement by Newton of what he regarded as the\n\u201cfoundation\u201d of natural philosophy. The third rule\nconcerns an induction problem: we have perceptions and experiments\nthat provide us with knowledge of the objects and natural phenomena in\nour neck of the universe, but on what basis can we reach a conclusion\nconcerning objects and phenomena throughout the rest of the\nuniverse? Newton himself reached such a conclusion about gravity in\nproposition seven of Book III of the Principia. Part of\nNewton\u2019s answer is presented in rule 3:\n\n\nThose qualities of bodies that cannot be intended and remitted [i.e.,\nincreased and diminished] and that belong to all bodies on which\nexperiments can be made should be taken as qualities of all bodies\nuniversally.\n\n\nWe know, say, that a clump of dirt has certain qualities such as\nextension and mobility, but how do we know that the entire earth has\nsuch qualities? It surely lies beyond the reach of our experiments, or\nat any rate, it did in Newton\u2019s day. Newton says that the sun\nand the earth interact according to his law of gravity, but how do we\nknow that the sun contains a quantity of matter, that it is a material\nbody with the same basic qualities that characterize the earth or the\nmoon? It wasn\u2019t at all obvious at the time that the sun is a\nmaterial body at all. Newton thinks that gravity reaches into the very\ncenter of the sun, but what did anyone in 1713 know about such things?\nNewton glosses his third rule in part as follows, connecting it with\nhis laws of motion:\n\n\nThat all bodies are movable and persevere in motion or in rest by\nmeans of certain forces (which we call forces of inertia) we infer\nfrom finding these properties in the bodies that we have seen. The\nextension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and force of\n inertia[23]\n of the whole arise from the extension, hardness, impenetrability,\nmobility and force of inertia of each of the parts; and thus we\nconclude that every one of the least parts of all bodies is extended,\nhard, impenetrable, movable, and endowed with a force of inertia. And\nthis is the foundation of all natural philosophy. (Newton 1999:\n795\u201396)\n\n\nMany of Newton\u2019s readers in 1713 would have granted him the\nfollowing inference: although we do not have any perceptions of, say,\nthe interior of the earth, or even of many ordinary objects within our\ngrasp, we can reasonably infer that everything with certain basic\nproperties\u2014something akin to what John Locke, borrowing a term\nof Robert Boyle\u2019s, called the \u201cprimary\nqualities\u201d\u2014at the macroscopic level is comprised of\nmicro-particles that are characterized by those same basic properties.\nBut at the end of his gloss of Rule 3, Newton applies this same (or\nanalogous) reasoning to the force of gravity, arguing as follows:\nsince we experience the fact that all bodies on or near the earth\ngravitate toward the earth\u2014in cases such as free fall\u2014and\nthat the moon gravitates toward the earth, etc., we can infer that all\nbodies everywhere gravitate toward all other bodies. This argument\nwould appear to suggest that gravity\u2014which, as we have seen, is\na kind of impressed force, an action\u2014is somehow akin to\nqualities like extension and impenetrability. So is Newton suggesting\nthat gravity is actually a quality of all bodies? He did not\nexplicitly endorse that claim, but Cotes did in a famous passage in\nhis editor\u2019s preface (Newton 1999, 391-92). Many understood\nCotes to be speaking for Newton, just as they interpreted Clarke a few\nyears later. Leibniz and his followers pounced: if Newton regards\ngravity as a quality, as a power of attraction, then he had indeed\nrevived the occult qualities of the Scholastics, for here we have a\nquality that is not explicable in mechanical terms. Unlike the usual\nproperties of extension, impenetrability and mobility discussed by\nCotes, gravity seemed like a hidden power. This topic became the\nsubject of intense debate throughout the first half of the eighteenth\ncentury (see the last section below).\n",
