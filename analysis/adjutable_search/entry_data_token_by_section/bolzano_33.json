    "main_text": "The So-called Bolzano Circle and Bolzano\u2019s Influence on Intellectual History || The So-called Bolzano Circle\n13.2 Bolzano\u2019s Influence on Intellectual History\n\nBolzano was a forerunner of important theories and ideas in various\nareas of knowledge. Many of Bolzano\u2019s ideas had to be discovered\nanew since Bolzano\u2019s preparatory work remained unknown in many\ncases and has come to light only from historical research.\nSuperficially speaking, it seems as if Bolzano had hardly any direct\ninfluence at all in the proper sense on the development of the\nsciences, although he accomplished significant research. This may of\ncourse in large part be due to the special circumstances under which\nBolzano had to work and publish. His writings thus often appeared\nanonymously and were for this reason often generally unknown \u2014\nat least not known under his name. Although Bolzano did not directly\ninfluence modern developments \u2014 in the area of logic, for\ninstance \u2014, he obviously did achieve a very tangible\n\u201cindirect\u201d and subliminal effect. For Bolzano\u2019s\nviews were familiar to very many who passed them on, partly with the\nmention of his name and partly without any such mention. Thus,\nBolzano\u2019s philosophy has not remained completely ineffectual: We\nknow that Twardowski was well familiar with Bolzano (Twardowski 1894),\nand we know that \u0141ukasiewicz was well acquainted with\nBolzano\u2019s method of idea-variation, as a section in his book on\nLogical Foundations of Probability Theory (\u0141ukasiewicz\n1913, \u00a7 24) shows. It is to be suspected that the whole famous\nPolish school of logic was thereby indirectly influenced by Bolzano\nwithout knowing exactly the places where this influence was exerted,\nand without Bolzano being mentioned in a way which would have been\nappropriate. Franz Brentano had studied with particular interest, as\nhe himself confessed, the Paradoxes of the Infinite; he was\nnot, however, as well familiar with Bolzano\u2019s philosophy as one\noften suspected. Nevertheless, it seems improbable that this\nfamiliarity with Bolzano, as little as is was, could have remained\nwithout any effect on his pupils such as Marty, Meinong, and Stumpf,\nalthough some of whom were \u201coutcasts\u201d from the orthodox\nBrentanian circle. Bolzano\u2019s influence on Husserl, however, is\nwell-known, and Husserl himself made no secret of it.\n\nBolzano had also effect upon some great figures of Bohemian cultural\nlife such as Palack\u00fd, Havli\u010dek, and\n\u010celakovsk\u00fd; this effect was based mainly on his moral,\nsocial and political views \u2014 hence, all things considered, on\nthose views for which he could not claim any particular originality.\nThe offshoots of Bolzano\u2019s ethical and political ideas reached\nand influenced, however, even the Charta 77 movement in the former\nCzechoslovakia some of whose representatives appealed explicitly to\nBolzano.\n",
