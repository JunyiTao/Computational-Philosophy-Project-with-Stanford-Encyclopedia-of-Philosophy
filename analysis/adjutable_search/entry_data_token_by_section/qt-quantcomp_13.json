    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions || Quantum Causality\n5.3 Quantum Causality\n\nIs quantum mechanics compatible with the principle of causality? This\nis an old question\u2014indeed one of the very first interpretational\nquestions confronted by the early commentators on the theory (Hermann\n2017; Schlick 1961, 1962). The contemporary literature continues to\nexhibit considerable skepticism in regards to the prospects of\nexplaining quantum phenomena causally (Hausman & Woodward 1999;\nVan Fraassen 1982; Woodward 2007), or at any rate locally\ncausally, especially in the wake\nof Bell\u2019s theorem (Myrvold\n2016). As a result of some fascinating theoretical work (Allen,\nBarrett, Horsman, Lee, & Spekkens 2017; Costa & Shrapnel 2016;\nShrapnel 2017), however, it seems that the prospects for a locally\ncausal explanation of quantum phenomena are not quite as hopeless as\nthey may initially have seemed, at least in the context of\nan interventionist theory of\ncausation. This is not to say that decades of physical and\nphilosophical investigations into the consequences of Bell\u2019s\ntheorem have all been mistaken, of course. For one thing, the\ninterventionist frameworks utilised in this new work are\noperationalist, thus the relevance of this work to so-called hidden\nvariables theories of quantum mechanics is unclear. Second, the\ninterventionist frameworks utilised are not classical, and neither is\nthe kind of causality they explicate. Indeed, in regard to the latter\npoint, it is arguably the key insight emerging from this work that the\nframeworks previously utilised for analysing interventionist causation\nin the quantum context are inappropriate to that context. In contrast\nto a classical interventionist framework in which events are thought\nof as primitive (i.e. as not further analysable), events in these\ngeneralised frameworks are characterised as processes with\nassociated inputs and outputs. Specifically, one characterises quantum\nevents using a concept from quantum computation and information theory\ncalled a quantum channel. And within this generalised\ninterventionist framework, causal models of quantum phenomena can be\ngiven which do not need to posit non-local causal influences, and\nwhich satisfy certain other desiderata typically required in a causal\nmodel (in particular that such a model respect the causal Markov\ncondition and that it not require \u2018fine-tuning\u2019; see\nShrapnel (2017)).\n",
