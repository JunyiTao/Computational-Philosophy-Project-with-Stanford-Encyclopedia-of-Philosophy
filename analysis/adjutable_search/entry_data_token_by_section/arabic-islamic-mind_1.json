    "main_text": "Al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\n2. Al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\n\n\n This development owes a great deal to the work of Abu Nasr Muhammad\nibn Muhammad ibn Tarkhan al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee (c. 870-950). A\nprolific author, Farabi, as he is often referred to in English,\nadopted and commented upon much of Aristotle's logical corpus,\nwhile turning to Plato for his political philosophy. His metaphysics\nand psychology were a blend of both traditions, establishing a\nmodified or Neoplatonised form of Aristotelianism which later\ngenerations adopted and adapted.\n\n\n Farabi's familiarity with Aristotle\nis evident in the summary sketch of his writings that he presents in\nThe Philosophy of Aristotle. The soul is defined as \u201cthat by\nwhich the animate substance\u2014I mean that which admits of \n life\u2014is realized as\n substance,\u201d[12]\nserving the triple function of\nbeing a formal, efficient and final cause. For human beings, the\nintellect assumes the mantle of substance (Mahdi, 125), it being\n\u201ca principle underlying the essence of man,\u201d both an agent\nand final cause (Mahdi, 122). Specifically, it is the theoretical\nintellect that has this status, the practical intellect being\nsubsidiary to it. The final perfection of a person is found in the\nactualization of this theoretical intellect, its substance being\nidentical with its act.\n\n\n Beyond the individual intellect there lies a universal (though Farabi\ndoes not call it such) Active (or Agent) Intellect (al-\u2018aql\nal-fa\u2018\u00e2l). This is conceived as the formal principle\nof the soul, engendering in the potential intellect both the basic\naxioms of thought and the ability to receive all other intelligible\nnotions (Mahdi, 127). This external intellect is also the ultimate\nagent and final cause of the individual intellect. It both facilitates\nthe individual intellect's operations and, serving as an example\nof perfect being, draws it back towards itself through acts of\nintellection. The more the individual intellect in act is absorbed in\ntheoretical activity, the greater its accumulation of scientific\nknowledge; each step bringing it closer to that totality of knowledge\nand essential being encapsulated in the Agent Intellect.\n\n\n For Farabi, the individual intellect, even\nwhen perfected, can only come close to joining with the substance of\nthe Agent Intellect. This reprises a theme sounded in Aristotle's\nmetaphysics, in which the intellects of the heavenly spheres, desiring\nto be like the Intellect that is the Prime Mover, imitate it as best\nthey can. For Farabi, a person's ultimate happiness is found in\nthis approximation to the ideal.\n\n\n Farabi expounds upon this and other issues\npertaining to the soul in his wide-ranging masterpiece,\n\u201cPrinciples of the Views of the Citizens of the\nPerfect\n State.\u201d[13]\nHe recounts the various faculties of the soul, following the model of\nAristotle's De anima, emphasizing the presence of an\ninclination or propensity (niz\u00e2\u2018) concomitant with\neach\n one.[14]\nThus,\nthe senses immediately like or dislike what they perceive, depending on\nwhether it is attractive or repulsive to them. This affective reaction\naccompanies the imaginative faculty as well as the practical intellect,\nwhich chooses its course of action accordingly.\n\n\n For Farabi, it is the faculty of will that\nis responsible for these desires and dislikes that occur in sensation\nand imagination, ultimately motivating the social and political\nbehavior of the individual (Walzer, 171\u2013173). Farabi distinguishes\nbetween what must be the automatic response of animals to the affects\ncreated in their senses and imagination, and the conscious and\nconsidered response of human beings, assisted by their rational\nfaculty. The former response is attributed to \u201cwill\u201d in\ngeneral (ir\u00e2dah), the latter to \u201cchoice\u201d\n(ikhtiy\u00e2r) (Walzer, 205).\n\n\n The intellect, considered as purely\nimmaterial, has no physical organ to sustain it, unlike the other\nfaculties of the soul. As Alexander of Aphrodisias, Farabi identifies\nthe heart as the \u201cruling organ\u201d of the\n body.[15]\nAssisted by the\nbrain, liver, spleen and other organs, the heart provides the innate\nheat that is required by the nutritive faculty, senses and imagination\n(Walzer, 175\u2013187).\n\n\n It is this innate heat that\npresumably is also responsible for the differences between the sexes,\nFarabi asserts. The greater warmth (as well as strength) in their\norgans and limbs make men generally more irascible and aggressively\nforceful than women, who in turn generally excel in the\n\u201cweaker\u201d qualities of mercy and\n compassion.[16]\nThe sexes are\nequal, however, as regards sensation, imagination and intellection.\n\n\n It would appear from this that Farabi has\nno problem in seeing both sexes as equal in terms of their cognitive\nfaculties and capabilities. This would seem to be part of his Platonic\nlegacy, a view shared by Averroes in his paraphrase of the Republic\n(Walzer, 401, note 421). In theory, therefore, Farabi would consider\nwomen capable of being philosophers (as well as prophets), able to\nattain the happiness and perfection this brings.\n\n\n Possible as this is, and necessary\neven in theory, Farabi does not elaborate on this view, in deference\nundoubtedly to Islamic conventions. He is more explicit as regards the\nprocess of intellection, a topic that he covers here and in greater\ndetail in a separate treatise, On the Intellect.\n\n\n In the Perfect State, Farabi already\ncharacterizes the potential or \u201cmaterial\u201d intellect, as\nAlexander called it, as a disposition in matter to receive intelligible\n\u201cimprints\u201d (rus\u00fbm al-ma\u2018q\u00fbl\u00e2t)\n(Walzer, 199). These imprints originate as sensible forms that are\nconveyed to the imagination and modified by it before being presented\nto the intellect. The potential intellect is considered unable to\nrespond to these imaginative constructs on its own, it needs an agent\nto activate it, to move it from potentiality to actuality. This is\nAristotle's active intellect, as removed by Alexander of\nAphrodisias from the individual soul to a universal separate sphere of\nbeing. It is now associated with the tenth heavenly sphere (Walzer,\n203), being a separate substance that serves both as an emanating\nsource of forms in prophecy (Walzer, 221), and as a force in all people\nthat actualizes both potential intellects and potential intelligibles.\nFarabi compares its force to the light of the sun that facilitates\nvision by illuminating both the subject and object of sight (Walzer,\n201).\n\n\n With the assistance of this Agent\nIntellect, the potential intellect is able to receive all intelligible\nforms, beginning with \u201cthe first intelligibles which are common\nto all men,\u201d in the areas of logic, ethics and science (Walzer,\n205). These first intelligibles represent the first perfection in a\nperson, the final perfection being possession of as many intelligible\nnotions as it is possible to acquire. This creates the felicity,\nal-sa\u2018\u00e2dah, human beings strive to attain, for it brings\nthem close to the divine status of the Agent Intellect, having\nconjoined with it as much as is possible.\n\n\n Farabi portrays the imaginative\n faculty[17]\nas having a\nmimetic capability, \u201cimitating\u201d the sensible forms\npreviously received yet not present until recalled to mind. This\nimitative ability extends over all the other faculties of the soul,\nincluding the intelligible notions of the rational faculty. Farabi\nadapts this originally Aristotelian\n idea[18]\nto prophecy as well as to\nlesser forms of divination, asserting that an individual imagination\ncan receive intelligible ideas directly from the Agent Intellect,\nconverting them to imaginative representations. Farabi believes the\nAgent Intellect emanates particular as well as universal intelligibles\nupon a given individual, expressing present as well as future events,\nand, for the prophet, particularized knowledge of eternal truths,\n\u201cthings divine\u201d (ashy\u00e2\u2019u\nil\u00e2h\u00eeyah) (Walzer, 221\u201323).\n\n\n Farabi naturalizes prophecy by having the\nemanated forms received by the imagination pass on to the senses and\nthen out to the air. There they assume a sensible though immaterial\nform that then embarks on a conventional return trip to the internal\nsenses (Walzer, 223).\n\n\n Farabi's most detailed study of the\nintellect is to be found in the aptly titled \u201cEpistle on the\n Intellect,\u201d Ris\u00e2la fi\u2019l-\u2018Aql.[19]\nHe begins by showing the\ndiverse contexts in which nominal and verbal forms of\n\u201cintellect\u201d and \u201cintelligence\u201d are employed.\nAristotle, he points out, uses the term in his logical, ethical,\npsychological and metaphysical treatises. In each area, it is the\nintellect that is responsible for comprehending the first principles or\npremises of the subject, and for enabling a person to perfect his (or\nher) knowledge of it. For Farabi, this apparently innocuous statement\nmust serve to commend the epistemic methodologies of Aristotle over the\ndenaturalized, logically confined analyses of the\nmutakallim\u00fbn, the Muslim theologians. Yet, as emerges\nlater in the treatise, these first principles, seemingly innate to the\nintellect, are engendered there by the Agent Intellect (Bouyges, 29;\nHyman, 219). That universal intellect, for all its ontic priority, is\nthe last of the four intellects that Farabi formally discusses in the\ntreatise. It is a separate intellect, totally immaterial and external\nto the human intellect. Revising al-Kindi's schematization,\nand showing the influence of Alexander of Aphrodisias'\nunderstanding of Aristotle, Farabi posits a cognitive process in which\nthe human intellect moves from a state of potentiality to one of\nactuality, acquiring in the process a discrete sum of intelligibles\nthat it can access when desired.\n\n\n Ignoring here the role of sensation and\nimagination prior to the activity of the rational faculty, Farabi\ndescribes the potential intellect as prepared and disposed to abstract\nthe intelligible \u201cessences\u201d and forms of things from\ntheir\n matters.[20]\nThe\ndynamic readiness of the potential intellect to act is due, however, to\nthe Agent Intellect. It invests the sub-lunar world with the forms that\ncomprise all species, rendering them potentially intelligible; and\nenergizes our potential intellect to receive them (Bouyges, 24, 29;\nHyman, 218, 219).\n\n\n This reception of the intelligible\ntransforms the potential intellect from being a mere disposition to\nthink to the active thinking of the intelligible; a process in which\nthe \u201cintellect in act\u201d (al-\u2018aql bi\u2019l-fi\u2018l)\nbecomes its intelligible (Bouyges, 15; Hyman, 216). The potential\nintellect itself remains unaffected by this metamorphosis, however, and\nremains purely potential, able to receive additional intelligible ideas\nobjectively. The greater the number of intelligibles deposited by the\nintellect in act in the \u201cacquired intellect\u201d (al-\u2018aql\nal-mustaf\u00e2d), the more that intellect thinks itself in\nthinking them. In doing so, the acquired intellect imitates the Agent\nIntellect, which it increasingly resembles.\n\n\n Echoing a Neoplatonic hierarchy of being,\nFarabi ranks the intelligible order of our sub-lunar world, the Agent\nIntellect being at the top and prime matter at the bottom. Intellection\nof the separate, immaterial substances of the heavens, particularly\nintellection of the Agent Intellect, is the highest cognition\ndesirable, except that Farabi does not think it possible. Not even\nacquiring total or near-total knowledge of everything in our world will\nsuffice for Farabi; the formation of our intelligibles differs from\ntheir order in the Agent Intellect, and there is a qualitative\ndifference between their presence in it and as known to us; we must\nmake do with imitations or likenesses (ashb\u00e2h) of the pure\nintelligibles (Bouyges, 29; Hyman, 219).\n\n\n Nevertheless, the formation of a\nsubstantial amount of knowledge, or in Farabian terms, a strong\nacquired intellect, is that which forms and enriches us, creating a\nsubstance that in its immateriality resembles the Agent Intellect. This\nrepresents \u201cultimate happiness\u201d (al-sa\u2018\u00e2dah\nal-qusw\u00e2), and even an afterlife (al-hay\u00e2h\nal-\u00e2kh\u00eerah) of sorts (Bouyges, 31; Hyman, 220).\n\n\n Farabi holds diverse views on immortality,\nnow identifying it with a perfected intellect, now with the entire\nsoul, though his justification for positing an eternal individual soul\nor intellect is weak (Davidson 1992, 56\u201357). As with his more detailed\ntreatment of prophecy, Farabi may prudently be appropriating the\nreligious belief in an afterlife, a tenet held fervently\u2014and\nvery differently\u2014by his community.\n",
