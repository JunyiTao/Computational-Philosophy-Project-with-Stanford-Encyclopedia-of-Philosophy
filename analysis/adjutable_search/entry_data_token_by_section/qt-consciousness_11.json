    "main_text": "Mind and Matter as Dual Aspects || Mind-Matter Correlations\n5.2 Mind-Matter Correlations\n\nWhile the proposal by Bohm and Hiley essentially sketches a conceptual\nframework without further concrete details, particularly concerning\nthe mental domain, the Pauli-Jung conjecture (Atmanspacher and Fuchs\n2014) concerning dual-aspect monism offers some more material to\ndiscuss. An intuitively appealing way to represent their approach\nconsiders the distinction between epistemic and ontic domains of\nmaterial reality due to quantum theory in parallel with the\ndistinction between epistemic and ontic mental domains.\n\nOn the physical side, the epistemic/ontic distinction refers to the\ndistinction between a \u201clocal realism\u201d of empirical facts\nobtained from classical measuring instruments and a \u201cholistic\nrealism\u201d of entangled systems (Atmanspacher and Primas 2003).\nEssentially, these domains are connected by the process of\nmeasurement, thus far conceived as independent of conscious observers.\nThe corresponding picture on the mental side refers to a distinction\nbetween conscious and unconscious\n domains.[18]\n In Jung\u2019s depth psychological conceptions, these two domains\nare connected by the emergence of conscious mental states from the\nunconscious, analogous to physical measurement.\n\nIn Jung\u2019s depth psychology it is crucial that the unconscious\nhas a collective component, unseparated between individuals\nand populated by so-called archetypes. They are regarded as\nconstituting the psychophysically neutral level comprising both the\ncollective unconscious and the holistic reality of quantum theory. At\nthe same time they operate as \u201cordering factors\u201d, being\nresponsible for the arrangement of their psychical and physical\nmanifestations in the epistemically distinguished domains of mind and\nmatter. More details of this picture can be found in Jung and Pauli\n(1955), Meier (2001), Atmanspacher and Primas (2009), Atmanspacher and\nFach (2013), and Atmanspacher and Fuchs (2014).\n\nThis scheme is clearly related to\n scenario (B)\n of\n Sec. 2,\n combining an epistemically dualistic with an ontically monistic\napproach. Correlations between the mental and the physical are\nconceived as non-causal, thus respecting the causal closure of the\nphysical  against the mental. However, there is a causal\nrelationship (in the sense of formal rather than efficient causation)\nbetween the psychophysically neutral, monistic level and the\nepistemically distinguished mental and material domains. In\nPauli\u2019s and Jung\u2019s terms this kind of causation is\nexpressed by the ordering operation of archetypes in the collective\nunconscious.\n\nIn other words, this scenario offers the possibility that the mental\nand material manifestations may inherit mutual correlations due to the\nfact that they are jointly caused by the psychophysically neutral\nlevel. One might say that such correlations are remnants reflecting\nthe lost holism of the underlying reality. They are not the\nresult of any direct causal interaction between mental and\nmaterial domains. Thus, they are not suitable for an\nexplanation of direct efficient mental causation. Their\nexistence would require some psychophysically neutral activity\nentailing correlation effects that would be misinterpreted as mental\ncausation of physical events. Independently of quantum theory, a\nrelated move was suggested by Velmans (2002, 2009). But even without\nmental causation,\n scenario (B)\n is relevant to ubiquitous correlations between conscious mental\nstates and physical brain states.\n",
