    "main_text": "The importance of religious emotions\n5. The importance of religious emotions\n\nThe foregoing helps us to answer the question about the importance of\nreligious emotions. Aristotle points out that the character virtues\nare dispositions of the appetitive (desiring, caring) part of the soul\nas shaped by logos (see Nicomachean Ethics, Book\nOne, Chapter 13). The three Christian emotions used as examples in\nthis article are episodes that arise out of dispositions of caring\nshaped by beliefs (each of the emotion-types gives its name to a\nChristian virtue). The episodes are important, from the viewpoint of\nthe Christian tradition, because they express a character that is\nattuned to the way things are: to our nature as creatures, to God\u2019s\nnature as God, to the relations we bear to the goods and evils of\nlife. In an article titled \u201cWhy Christianity Works: An\nEmotion-Focused Phenomenological Account,\u201d Christian Smith\nappeals to the character of religious emotions in explaining the\ntenacity of Christianity in the face of various secularizing\ninfluences.\n\nAs dispositions of caring, the virtues of gratitude, contrition, and\ncompassion have the value of motivating appropriate actions: acts of\nthat special gracious justice that is an appropriate response to gifts\nand their givers, acts of self-correction and atonement for wrongs\ncommitted, and acts of helping those who suffer. As dispositions of\nperception, these virtues have the value of putting their possessor in\ndirect perceptual acquaintance with moral aspects of reality: her\nindebtedness for gifts, the evil of her actions and the forgiveness of\nGod, and the distress of her fellows and the relation of that distress\nto the life of Christ. And the emotions themselves are the episodes in\nwhich these motives and perceptions are particularized to the concrete\ncircumstances of daily life.\n\nSo one epistemic value of Christian emotions is that of bringing the\nsubject into perceptual acquaintance with truths as the religious\ntradition conceives them. Another potential epistemic value is that of\nproviding evidence for those purported truths. The more concretely one\ntreats the religious emotions \u2014 moving in the direction of James\nand away from Schleiermacher and Otto, as this article has done\n\u2014 the less evidential value the religious emotions have. The\nreason is that the perceptions are so shaped by the propositions that\nthey might be called upon to provide evidence for, that the\n\u201cevidence\u201d is undercut by circularity.\n\nSo the value that the particular religious emotion-types have for\nadherents of any particular religious tradition is very great. They\nare a sine qua non for genuine adherence to the tradition,\nand the degree to which they are actual in the life of any adherent is\nan index of the depth with which that adherent represents his or her\ntradition and is a successful human specimen by its lights. No wonder,\nthen, that one strand of philosophical reflection about religious\nemotions, differing even more from the Schleiermacher-Otto and James\naxes than these differ from each other, is self-consciously\ncriteriological or regulative. Clarificatory reflection about\nreligious emotions serves a purpose of buffering the tradition against\nthe demoralizing corrosions of the spirit of the age. One thinks of\nthe work of Jonathan Edwards and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. (See the\nentry on\n S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard.)\n",
