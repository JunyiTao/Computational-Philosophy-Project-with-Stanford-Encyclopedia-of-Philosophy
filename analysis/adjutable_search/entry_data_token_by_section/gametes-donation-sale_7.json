    "main_text": "Donor Anonymity || Psychological Distress and Self-Knowledge\n2.1 Psychological Distress and Self-Knowledge\n\nOne reason for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is the distress\nthat advocates of disclosure claim many donor-conceived children\nsuffer as a consequence of the absence of identifying information\nabout their biological progenitors. This distress is sometimes\nreferred to as \u2018genealogical bewilderment\u2019, a term\noriginally coined in reference to the distress experienced by\nadoptees, and its symptoms are said to include difficulty developing a\npersonal identity that feels genuine, anguish about not knowing the\nidentity of one\u2019s genetic relations, and an obsession with\ntrying to find out information about one\u2019s genetic relations\n(Sants 1964; Cahn 2009b). Advocates of the right to know point to both\nscientific studies and general social observations, such as the rise\nof services to help donor-conceived individuals find their biological\nrelations, as evidence of the severity of this harm (McWhinnie 2001;\nFrith 2001; Ravitsky 2010).\n\nA related argument is that donor-conceived individuals are denied an\nimportant good if they are not given access to detailed information\nabout their biological relations. More than simply satisfying\ncuriosity, some argue that knowledge about one\u2019s biological\nrelations (especially through contact) is important for self-knowledge\n(Velleman 2005, 2008). On this view, while a name and biographical\ndetails may not replace being reared by biological relations, they do\nat least provide donor-conceived individuals with some\ninformation, and make contact later in life possible.\n\nHowever, both these arguments have been challenged on empirical and\nphilosophical grounds. While some studies do indeed show that a subset\nof donor-conceived individuals suffer psychological distress from not\nknowing the identity of their progenitors, others show that such\ndistress is not common, and is not particularly severe when it does\narise (Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014; Haslanger 2009). Studies also show\nthat early disclosure helps children incorporate the fact that they\nwere donor-conceived into their identity and sense of self, thus\nhelping donor-conceived children avoid some of psychological harms\nassociated with genealogical bewilderment (Golombok et. al. 2002).\nAdvocates of the permissibility of donor anonymity thus argue that\nthere is no clear evidence that donor anonymity is likely to result in\nsevere harm to offspring. If anything, the evidence suggests that we\nshould have a policy of early disclosure.\n\nFurthermore, some argue that any psychological harm that does arise is\nlikely socially constructed. As evidence, they point to studies\nshowing that individuals who are unaware that they were\ndonor-conceived do no worse than their peers when it comes to\npsychological wellbeing (Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014; Haslanger 2009).\nConsequently, they argue that any psychological harms experienced by\ndonor-conceived individuals arise in virtue of the social importance\nplaced on biological ties rather than any \u2018necessary\u2019\ndeficit arising from being reared by individuals who are not genetic\nrelations. Similar arguments have also been raised in response to\nVelleman\u2019s views regarding the value of contact with genetic\nrelations for self-knowledge (Haslanger 2009). \n\nIf the psychological harms arising from donor-anonymity are socially\nconstructed, then prohibiting anonymous gamete donation may exacerbate\nthe harms suffered by donor-conceived children. This is because such a\nprohibition could further reify the importance of biological ties\n(sometimes referred to as \u2018biologism\u2019), which is what\ngives rise to the harm in the first place (Melo-Mart\u00edn 2014;\nLeighton 2014; Haslanger 2009). By signalling the importance of\nbiological ties, prohibiting donor anonymity might further stigmatize\nthose raised by non-biological parents.\n\nHowever, that a harm is socially constructed does not make it any less\nreal, or less in need of redress. This results in a difficult bind for\nthose who agree that the harms are socially constructed. They are left\nhaving to balance the interests of donor-conceived offspring with the\nbroader social goal of eliminating unjust socially constructed harms.\nThe best way to go about doing so is unclear (Haslanger 2009).\n",
