We\nmight want to have qualitative and quantitative uncertainty because we\nmay be so uncertain about some situations that we do not want to\nassign numbers to the probabilities of their events, while there are\nother situations where we do have a sense of the probabilities of\ntheir events; and these situations can interact.\n\nThere are many situations in which we might not want to assign\nnumerical values to uncertainties. One example is where a computer\nselects a bit 0 or 1, and we know nothing about how this bit is\nselected. Results of coin flips, on the other hand, are often used as\nexamples of where we would assign probabilities to individual\noutcomes.\n\nAn example of how these might interact is where the result of the bit\ndetermines whether a fair coin or a weighted coin (say, heads with\nprobability \\(2/3\\)) be used for a coin flip. Thus there is\nqualitative uncertainty as to whether the action of flipping a coin\nyields heads with probability \\(1/2\\) or \\(2/3\\).\n\nOne way to formalize the interaction between probability and\nqualitative uncertainty is by adding another relation to the model and\na modal operator to the language as is done in Fagin and Halpern\n(1988, 1994). Formally, we add to a basic finite probability model a\nrelation \\(R\\subseteq W^2\\). Then we add to the language a modal\noperator \\(\\Box\\), such that \\((M,w)\\models \\Box\\phi\\) if and only if\n\\((M,w')\\models \\phi\\) whenever \\(w R w'\\).\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n\n\n\\(W = \\{(0,H),(0,T),(1,H),(1,T)\\}\\),\n\n\n\\(\\Phi = \\{h,t\\}\\) is the set of atomic propositions,\n\n\n\\(R = W^2\\),\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{P}\\) associates with \\((0,H)\\) and \\((0,T)\\) the\ndistribution mapping \\((0,H)\\) and \\((0,T)\\) each to \\(1/2\\), and\nassociates with \\((1,H)\\) and \\((1,T)\\) the distribution mapping\n\\((1,H)\\) to \\(2/3\\) and \\((1,T)\\) to \\(1/3\\),\n\n\n\\(V\\) maps \\(h\\) to the set \\(\\{(0,H),(1,H)\\}\\) and \\(t\\) to the set\n\\(\\{(0,T),(1,T)\\}\\).\n\n\nThen the following formula is true at \\((0,H)\\): \\(\\neg \\Box h \\wedge\n(\\neg \\Box P(h)= 1/2) \\wedge (\\Diamond P(h) = 1/2)\\). This can be read\nas it is not known that \\(h\\) is true, and it is not known that\nthe probability of \\(h\\) is \\(1/2\\), but it is possible that the\nprobability of \\(h\\) is \\(1/2\\).\n",
