    "main_text": "Preliminaries || A Priori Knowledge and Justification: The Standard View\n1.1 A Priori Knowledge and Justification: The Standard View\n\nThe concept of the a priori is fundamentally a concept of\nindependence from experience. The a priori stands in\ncontrast to the a posteriori or empirical. Knowledge is\nempirical just in case it is derived from experience. What experience\nincludes is contested. Experience uncontroversially includes sense\nperception. It arguably also includes introspection and the testimony\nof others. Much of what we know is empirical: we know by sense\nperception or introspection or the testimony of others, etc. A\npriori knowledge\u2014if there is any\u2014would be independent\nof sense perception, introspection, etc. (see entry on\n rationalism vs. empiricism).\n A majority of epistemologists could probably agree that justification\nis necessary for knowledge if one interprets justification broadly\n(e.g., so that a belief might be justified in virtue of being produced\nby a reliable cognitive mechanism, or by an exercise of intellectual\nvirtue, or by having supporting evidence from good reasons). For the\npurposes of this entry, we will understand justification broadly and\nassume that in order to have a priori knowledge of a\nproposition one\u2019s belief in that proposition must be justified\n(see entries on\n the analysis of knowledge;\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification;\n coherentist theories of epistemic justification;\n internalist vs. externalist conceptions of epistemic justification).\n\nSo on what we will call the standard view of a priori\nknowledge and\n justification,[1]\n being justified makes a very significant contribution to the\nepistemic status required for knowledge. Hence, for one\u2019s\nknowledge to be independent of experience, one\u2019s justification\nwould also have to be independent of experience. Such justification is\na priori.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely S could be justified in believing any\nproposition P in a way that is completely independent of\nexperience. For one thing, S must grasp or understand P\nbefore S could be justified in believing it. According to one\nfamiliar view, propositions involve properties and in order to\nunderstand a proposition, S must have or grasp concepts\ncorresponding to these properties. The majority of our concepts are\nempirical. Hence, without experience S could not believe, or\neven understand, most propositions; so without experience S\ncould not be justified in believing these propositions. For example,\nit is unlikely the concepts of marriage and bachelorhood are innate,\nso not even\n (1)\n is a proposition S could be justified in believing without any\nexperience at all. Hence, the sense in which a priori\njustification is independent of experience must be further specified:\nat the very least, experiences required to understand a proposition,\nincluding experiences necessary to grasp the relevant concepts, do not\ncount against being justified independently of experience.\n\nAccording to the standard view of a priori justification,\nonce S has the experiences needed to acquire the concepts of\nmarriage and bachelorhood and S understands\n (1),\n S has justification to believe\n (1).\n No additional experience is needed. Compare:\n\n(7)\n that all bachelors are untidy.\n\n\nIf S has the experiences needed to acquire the concepts of\nbachelorhood and untidiness, acquires these concepts, and understands\n(7), S will not have a justification to believe (7)\u2014even\nif we suppose, for the moment, that all bachelors are untidy. S\nwould have to observe many bachelors and their personal habits, or be\ntold about the personal habits of bachelors by others for (7) to be\njustified. As we\u2019ve already noted,\n (1)\n is different: once S understands\n (1),\n this proposition will be justified for S\u2014or so says the\nstandard view.\n\nSo far we have only a negative account of a priori\njustification; it is justification that does not depend on experiences\nbeyond those necessary for understanding. But in virtue of what could\nS be justified in believing something apart from experience?\nThe standard answer appeals to the special nature of the propositions\nthat can be a priori justified: they are supposed to be\nself-evident.\n\n(SE)\nA proposition P is self-evident just in case P is\nevident for any person S who understands P. (P is\nevident for S when S has a degree of justification\nfor P that, when combined with some other conditions, is\nsufficient for S to have knowledge of P.)\n\n\nThis definition of self-evidence may not be entirely satisfactory. One\nseeking a positive, informative account of how S could be\njustified in believing P simply in virtue of the fact that\nS understands P should not be satisfied when told that\nP is a special, self-evident proposition, when all this means\nis that P is justified to a high degree for everyone who\nunderstands it. Nevertheless, the lack of an explanation of the\nmechanism that brings something about is not a decisive reason for\nthinking it could not come about. We shall assume that (SE) correctly\ndefines self-evidence.\n\nEven though any person, S, who understands a self-evident\nproposition, PSE, will be justified in believing\nPSE to a degree sufficient for knowledge, we cannot\nsay that if S understands PSE and believes\nPSE, then S will know PSE.\nWe have not yet addressed the connection between self-evidence and\ntruth, but this is not the problem: self-evidence is taken to imply\ntruth. To explain why S could understand and believe\nPSE but fail to know PSE, it will\nbe helpful to distinguish between propositional justification and\ndoxastic justification.\n\nWe introduce the distinction in terms of having good reasons, but it\ncan be generalized to other ways of being justified. If S has\ngood reasons for believing a proposition, P, e.g., if S\nknows some propositions that straightforwardly entail P,\nS has a propositional justification for P. Note that\nP might be propositionally justified for S even though\nS does not believe P\u2014while S knows\npropositions that entail P, the proposition P might\nnever have even occurred to S. E.g., suppose S knows\nthat her only pets are two cats. This entails that she has no pet\nhippopotamus, so this proposition is propositionally justified for\nS. But unless S is a little odd, this is not a\nproposition S currently believes. The formulation\n\u201cP is propositionally justified for S\u201d\nleaves open whether S believes P. The formulation\n\u201cS is propositionally justified in believing\nP\u201d indicates that P is propositionally justified\nfor S and that S believes P.\n\nIf S believes P and does so on the basis of good\nreasons, then S\u2019s believing P is doxastically\njustified. Significantly, doxastic justification requires more than\npropositional justification plus belief. P could be\npropositionally justified for S and S could believe\nP, but not believe P on the basis of the good reasons\nthat constitute S\u2019s propositional justification for\nP. E.g., despite having excellent reasons to believe there are\nno vampires, Vlad believes he is safe from vampires only because he\neats lots of garlic and wears a special cross to repel vampires.\nVlad\u2019s belief that he is safe from vampires would be\npropositionally justified, but not doxastically justified. Unless\nnoted, when we use \u201cjustified\u201d and its cognates without\nqualification we will mean \u201cdoxastically justified\u201d.\nKnowledge requires basing the belief in the proposition on something\nthat justifies it. This goes for moral knowledge of self-evident moral\npropositions as well as it goes for any other kind of knowledge.\n\nSo far, the standard view may understand the class of a\npriori propositions too narrowly. Mathematics and logic are\nregarded as the paradigm a priori disciplines. But it is\ndoubtful that all the mathematical and logical truths we know are\nself-evident. Many of these truths require proof. When S\nbelieves such a proposition, S\u2019s belief will not be based\nsolely on understanding the proposition. S\u2019s experience\nof constructing the proof will play an important role in\nS\u2019s justification for believing the proposition proven.\nIf the proof is complex, S\u2019s justification will probably\nin part rely on memory, e.g., of lemmas proven along the way. The\nstandard view can extend the class of a priori propositions\nwithout compromising its basic approach by adding that if S\nbelieves P on the basis of proving it from self-evident\npremises by steps that are self-evidently valid, then S is\na priori justified in believing P.\n\nTo sum up, the standard view holds that a priori knowledge is\njustified independently of experience, where this means experience\nbeyond the experience required to understand the relevant proposition.\nThere are certain special, self-evident propositions that are\npropositionally justified for any person who understands them. If a\nperson believes a self-evident proposition solely on the basis of\nunderstanding it, the person will be doxastically justified in\nbelieving it. Such propositions are often referred to as a\npriori, which should be taken to mean that it is possible for one\nto be a priori justified in believing them. By extension,\npropositions are also a priori if they can be deduced from\nself-evident premises via steps that are self-evidently valid. A\nperson who believes such a proposition on the basis of such a proof\nwill be a priori justified in believing it. It is also\npossible to be empirically justified in believing an a priori\nproposition, but one cannot be a priori justified in\nbelieving empirical\n propositions.[2]\n\nBefore closing the presentation of the standard view, we should\nhighlight a potential problem already implicit in our presentation. As\nwe stressed, the basic concept of a priori justification is\nof justification that is independent of experience. The standard view\nrecognizes that one typically needs experience to understand a\nproposition, and interprets experience independent justification as\njustification that requires no additional experience. But consider an\nexperience like this. You believe a mathematical proposition is true,\nbut solely on a teacher\u2019s testimony. You do not know for\nyourself. But then after turning the proposition over in your mind for\na while, perhaps by thinking through some examples, you \u201cget\nit\u201d; you \u201csee\u201d that the proposition is indeed true\n(see Bealer 2000).\n\nWhat happens in such cases? Understanding alone does not seem to\njustify you in believing. To be justified in believing the\nproposition\u2014in a way that does not depend upon\ntestimony\u2014you need to \u201csee\u201d it for yourself. Such\n\u201cseeing\u201d has various names, e.g., \u201cintuition\u201d,\n\u201crational insight\u201d, \u201cclear and distinct\nperception\u201d. But whatever it is called, it is hard to deny it is\nan experience. So the standard view faces a problem: there is a\ndistinctive kind of experience apparently required for a\npriori justification in believing, and hence, a priori\nknowledge of, some propositions typically regarded as a\npriori and perhaps even self-evident. One might be led to\nquestion whether one who understands such a proposition but has not\nyet had the experience of \u201cseeing\u201d the proposition to be\ntrue even has propositional justification. Finally, one might be led\nto wonder whether this kind of \u201cexperience\u201d is always\nrequired for a priori knowledge and justification that does\nnot depend upon proof.\n\nThose who take the standard view might respond by accepting that\nrational intuition is an experience and distinguishing this experience\nfrom the experiences that are involved in empirical justification,\ni.e., perception, proprioception, introspection, and memory. This\nmodified standard view could then maintain that a priori\nknowledge and justification are independent of the latter experiences,\nbut not necessarily all experience; a priori justification\ncan be grounded in an experience of rational intuition\u2014perhaps\nit is always so grounded. Thus, on the modified standard view, the\nspecial role of understanding comes down to this: understanding an\na priori proposition is the only prerequisite for\nrational insight into its truth; understanding the proposition does\nnot guarantee that one will attain such insight, but it is the only\nthing that is necessary. Notice, on this modified standard view,\nself-evident propositions no longer play such a prominent role. It is\nnot an essential part of the view that there are special propositions,\nand anyone who understands one of these propositions has propositional\njustification. If one wants to think in terms of special propositions,\nthere will be propositions that are special only in an attenuated\nsense: it is possible for a person to have the experience of seeing\nthe propositions to be true simply by understanding and thinking about\nthem. Some might consider this modification too much of a departure\nfrom the spirit of the standard view.\n\nWhile it is not beyond criticism, we will proceed assuming the\nstandard view about a priori knowledge and justification is\ntrue.\n",
