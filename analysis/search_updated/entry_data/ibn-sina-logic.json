    "preamble": "\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 [hereafter: Avicenna] (980\u20131037 CE) is\u2014directly\nor indirectly\u2014the most influential logician in the Arabic\ntradition. His work is central in the re-definition of a family of\nproblems and doctrines inherited from ancient and late ancient logic,\nespecially Aristotle and the Peripatetic tradition. While, in general\nterms, Avicenna squarely falls into a logical tradition that it is\nreasonable to characterize as Aristotelian, the trove of innovations\nhe introduces establishes him as a genuinely new canonical figure. Every\nlater logician in this tradition confronts him, either as a critic or\nas a follower, to the extent that, with few exceptions, Aristotle and\nthe Peripatetic tradition almost entirely disappear from the\nscene. Arabic logic accordingly divides into two areas and periods:\npre-Avicennan and post-Avicennan (Street\n2004).[1]\n\nThe innovations introduced by Avicenna include systematic as well as\ntechnical points: from the division of logic into its main areas to\nthe reading of propositions and the understanding of modality; from a\nnew account of hypothetical propositions to his theory of\ndemonstration.\n\nThis entry aims to offer an account of some of the most representative\nfeatures of Avicenna\u2019s logic without any pretense to\nexhaustiveness. A standard classification of the works and contents of\nthe Aristotelian Organon in the Arabic tradition (which\nincludes Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge, alongside\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric and Poetics) divides\nthe study of logic broadly into two main areas focusing either on (i)\nformal aspects (e.g., the analysis of the truth conditions of\npropositions, inference, and the structure of arguments) or (ii) on\nmaterial aspects (e.g., the classification of arguments with\nrespect to their terms and premises, which underwrites a standard\ndivision of logic into five areas: demonstration, dialectic,\nsophistic, rhetoric, and poetics). The entry focuses primarily on (i)\nand limits the treatment of (ii) to the case of demonstration and\nfallacies.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Avicenna\u2019s Logical Works and His Sources\n\nAvicenna\u2019s logical works consist of a significant amount of\nmaterial unevenly distributed across his various philosophical\nsummae. The most comprehensive treatment of logic is, by far,\nthe one to be found in the monumental treatment of the\n\u0160if\u0101\u02be (The Cure), from the 1020s,\nwhere Avicenna extensively engages in systematic analysis as well as\ninterpretive debate with the Peripatetic tradition. At the opposite\nend of the spectrum is the I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t\nwa-tanb\u012bh\u0101t (Pointers and Reminders), the\nshortest and likely the latest (from the 1030s), where Avicenna\norganizes the material in an original way that came to shape the\napproach to logic in the Post-Avicennan tradition. In between (not\nchronologically, as the work largely reflects Avicenna\u2019s early\nviews from around 1014) lies the account of logic developed in the\nNa\u011f\u0101t (The Salvation). While offering a\nmuch abridged treatment (and leaving out dialectic, rhetoric, and\npoetics altogether), the latter is methodologically closer to the\nCure than it is to Pointers and Reminders but far\nless ponderous, and offers a good point of access to Avicenna\u2019s\nlogic as a whole.\n\nIn light of their relative position in the corpus, the balance of\ndetail and perspicuity, and\u2014in the case of the Cure and\nPointers\u2014the relative influence they exerted on the\nlater tradition, I have chosen in this entry to focus almost\nexclusively on these three sources, which also happen to be the ones\nthat are in better shape in terms of available editions.\n\nOther treatments of logic include the account found in the D\u0101ne\u0161n\u0101me-ye \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be\u012b (Philosophy for \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be ad-Dawla),\nin Persian, or the one preserved by the partially extant al-Ma\u0161riqiyy\u016bn (The Easterners), which reflects an approach no\nlonger committed to the terminology and exegetical problems of the\nAristotelian tradition, written as it is in opposition to the methods\nand doctrines of (Western) Ba\u0121dadi Aristotelians (Street 2004).\n\nFinally, interesting insights on certain areas of logic may also be gleaned from additional heterogeneous sources, such as Avicenna\u2019s correspondence\n(Street 2010a) and texts not directly dealing with\nlogic, most notably the Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t (especially books\nI and V), which is his major work in metaphysics.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s logic is indebted first and foremost to\nAristotle\u2014the First Teacher (al-mu\u02bfallim al-awwal)\u2014and\nthe works of the Organon: the Categories\n(Maq\u016bl\u0101t), On Interpretation\n(\u02bfIb\u0101ra), the Prior Analytics\n(An\u016bl\u016b\u1e6d\u012bq\u0101 \u016bl\u0101 or\nQiy\u0101s), the Posterior Analytics\n(An\u016bl\u016b\u1e6d\u012bq\u0101 \u1e6f\u0101niya or\nBurh\u0101n), the Topics\n(\u1e6c\u016bb\u012bq\u0101 or \u011eadal), and the\nSophistical Refutations (S\u016bfis\u1e6d\u012bq\u0101 or Mu\u0121\u0101la\u1e6da). As noted above, the Arabic\nOrganon included Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge\n(\u012as\u0101\u0121\u016b\u011f\u012b or\nMad\u1e2bal) as well as Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric\n(\u1e2ai\u1e6d\u0101ba) and Poetics\n(\u0160i\u02bfr).\n\nBesides Aristotle, among the figures we encounter in Avicenna\u2019s\nlogical writings\u2014whether identifiable by name, definite\ndescription, or doctrine\u2014are Plato, Theophrastus, Alexander of\nAphrodisias, Galen, Porphyry, Themistius, and Philoponus from the\nGreek tradition; al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and other\nBa\u0121d\u0101d\u012b Aristotelians from the Arabic tradition (all\nvariously involved in exegetical efforts focusing on the books of the\nOrganon, traces of which survive in the glosses to the\nfamous manuscript Paris BNF, Arabe 2346 that preserves\nits Arabic translation). Their presence varies from the explicit ascription\nof alternative interpretations (e.g., in the case of the\ninterpretation of the absolute proposition) to the rejection of\ncompeting accounts (the contrast between \u201cthe widespread\nview\u201d (al-ma\u0161h\u016br) and \u201cthe\ntruth\u201d (al-\u1e25aqq) is a standard device of\nAvicenna\u2019s style of argument); from the tacit adoption of\nsystematic distinctions and concepts (especially with regard to\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, who is rarely acknowledged) to minute\nexegetical points.\n\nIn the following, I refer to Avicenna\u2019s works by title, book, chapter, page, and line numbers from the Cairo edition for all\nworks that are part of the \u0160if\u0101\u02be; from Forget\u2019s edition of the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t wa-tanb\u012bh\u0101t, and from D\u0101ne\u0161pa\u017e\u016bh\u2019s\nedition of the Na\u011f\u0101t.\n2. Definition and Subject Matter of Logic\n\nA standard feature of late ancient Greek commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s individual works\nis to begin with prolegomena dealing with the purpose and\nbenefit of a certain discipline, determining its subject matter and\nrank within the system. Similar issues influence Avicenna\u2019s\napproach to the question of the nature of logic and what it aims to\naccomplish as a discipline.\n\nLogic is a theoretical discipline that provides the tools and methods\nrequired to avoid error in reasoning, where reasoning means acquiring\nnew knowledge (conceptual or propositional) of what is unknown (ma\u011fh\u016bl)\nstarting from what is known (ma\u02bfl\u016bm), and to attain the optimal epistemic\nstates legitimately associated with various domains of human\ncognition, most notably certainty (yaq\u012bn) in scientific\ndiscourse (\u02bfilm) and persuasion\n(iqn\u0101\u02bf) in dialectic and rhetorical contexts.\n\nAccordingly, logic has a twofold nature: it is at the same time (i) a\nnormative (literally \u201ccanonical\u201d) instrument, according to\nthe definition in Pointers and Reminders, with respect to any other\ndiscipline, and (ii) a part of philosophy, i.e., an Aristotelian\nscience with its own internal structure, which presupposes a\nwell-defined subject.\n\nIf the purpose and benefit of logic is to lead from what is known to what is unknown, for example from premises to conclusion\nin a valid argument whose premises are asserted, Avicenna\u2019s\naccount of the subject (maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf) of logic is\ninextricably tied with a fundamental distinction in Arabic logic,\nwhich can be traced back at least to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, between\nthe two main ways in which knowledge is available to the human mind:\nconception (ta\u1e63awwur) and assertion\n(ta\u1e63d\u012bq).\n\nThe distinction between conception and assertion marks the boundary\nbetween the acquisition or possession of individual concepts or\nnotions, and the ascription of truth to statements or judgments. It\nprovides the foundations of Avicenna\u2019s logic (as well as those\nof his epistemology) and determines two distinct modes of knowledge\nlinked on the one hand with (i) concept formation and the domain of\ndefinition (\u1e25add) and description (rasm), and\non the other with (ii) truth and reasoning (demonstrative and\nnon-demonstrative syllogism (qiy\u0101s), depending on the\nepistemic strength of the assertions involved).\n\nThe ultimate building-blocks of definitions (directly) and of syllogisms\n(indirectly) are intelligible notions (ma\u02bf\u0101nin\nma\u02bfq\u016bla). Logic deals with a special kind of\nintelligible notions, which in the Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t are\ncharacterized as second-order intelligible notions\n(ma\u02bfqul\u0101t \u1e6f\u0101niya)\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t I.2, 10\u201311). Assuming that\nfirst-order notions are things like \u201chuman\u201d,\n\u201crational\u201d, \u201cwhiteness\u201d, or \u201cstone\u201d,\nsecond-order (or more generally, higher-order) notions are either\ngenuinely distinct concepts such as \u201csubject\u201d,\n\u201cpredicate\u201d, \u201cgenus\u201d,\n\u201cproposition\u201d, and \u201csyllogism\u201d or, on a weaker\nreading, ways to ascribe second-order properties (such as being a\nuniversal or being a genus and so on) to first-order notions. Logic\ninvestigates the salient properties that hold of second-order notions,\nsuch as the properties of being a genus, the characteristics of\npropositions and their terms, the types of predication\n(essential and accidental), the truth-conditions of propositions, the\nconditions under which arguments are valid and those under which\narguments that seem to be valid are not. On the identification of\nsecondary intelligibles and the subject matter of logic, see (Street 2013) and (Sabra 1980).\n\nFurthermore, logic entertains two levels of analysis, addressing\ndistinct sets of considerations that are commonly referred to as\nformal and material. Formal characteristics are the quantity and\nquality of a proposition or the arrangement of terms in an argument,\nand in general everything that is necessary and sufficient to proceed\nwithout error in reasoning.\n\nMaterial aspects of logic involve considerations relative to the types of terms\nused in propositions and arguments and the relations holding among the\nterms. Thus, for instance, the question whether an argument is\ndemonstrative or not is typically a question that concerns not only\nits form (a demonstrative argument must be valid and consist of well-formed\npropositions), but also its matter, namely\nwhether its terms adequately express the right kinds of necessary and\nexplanatory relations.\n\nThe question what the subject matter of logic is became pressing in later\nArabic logic, as Avicenna\u2019s explicit remarks in the\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t were taken to identify too narrow a\nsubject, and conceptions and assertions gained traction as a\nplausible, more general alternative to second-order notions\n(El-Rouayheb 2012).\n\nOn the relation between logic as an instrument and logic as a science,\nsee Qiy\u0101s I.2, Mad\u1e2bal I.3 and for a\ngeneral discussion (Sabra 1980).\n3. Propositions\n\nAvicenna recognizes two basic types of proposition\n(qa\u1e0diyya): (1) categoricals\n(\u1e25amliyy\u0101t), atomic subject-predicate\npropositions, qualified in various ways; and (2) hypotheticals\n(\u0161ar\u1e6diyy\u0101t), molecular propositions\ngoverned by a main connective, which may express a conditional\n(mutta\u1e63il) or a disjunctive (munfa\u1e63il)\nstatement taking as its parts categoricals, hypotheticals, or a\ncombination thereof.\n3.1 Categorical Propositions\n\nCategorical propositions are subject\n(maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf)-predicate\n(ma\u1e25m\u016bl) propositions expressing a relation\n(nisba) or judgment (\u1e25ukm) between terms. They\nare usually classified according to a number of distinctions and\nreadings.\n\nThe first layer of analysis involves their quality\n(kayfiyya) and quantity (kammiyya). An Avicennan\ncategorical is either (a) determinate (mu\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63ala), which\nmeans that it is in turn either a quantified (ma\u1e25\u1e63\u016bra) or a\nsingular (\u0161a\u1e2bsiyya) proposition (that is to say an a-, e-, i-, or\no-proposition or one which takes a singular term as its subject) or\n(b) indeterminate (muhmala), when it is neither quantified nor\nsingular. If a proposition contains at least one negative term it is\ncalled metathetic (ma\u02bfd\u016bla).\n The second layer of analysis involves a consideration of the\nlogical form of a categorical proposition as opposed to its surface\nexpression. Avicenna introduces a distinction between the bipartite\n(\u1e6fun\u0101\u02beiyya), the tripartite\n(\u1e6ful\u0101\u1e6fiyya), and the quadripartite\n(rub\u0101\u02bfiyya) proposition. In the first case the\ncopula is not explicit, which is grammatical in Arabic as\nin certain cases the juxtaposition of two terms may be sufficient to\nyield a predicative statement (A B); in the second case the copula is\nexplicit but the proposition is not explicitly modalized (A is B); in\nthe third case the copula is explicit and the proposition is\nexplicitly modalized (A is necessarily B or A is possibly\n B).[2]\n The third layer of analysis involves modality, whether implicitly\nor explicitly. A categorical proposition is either unqualified\n(mu\u1e6dlaqa, commonly translated as \u201cabsolute\u201d) or qualified by a specific modality\n(munawwa\u02bfa). The latter is usually distinguished into\nthree main types: the necessary, the possible, and the impossible\nproposition.\n\n\nThis yields an eight-fold categorization occasionally advocated by\nAvicenna himself when he says, for example in the treatment of\nhypothetical propositions, that the categoricals embedded in\nthem may be one of the above eight (Qiy\u0101s VII.1, 361.1\u2013362.4).\n3.1.1 Modality and reading: referential/substantial and descriptional\n\nAvicenna may be credited with one of the most significant reforms in\nthe analysis of propositional forms in the Peripatetic tradition. His\nnew catalog of subject-predicate propositions, their relations of\ncontradiction, subalternation, and conversion, became the center of\ngravity of an established tradition of logic.\n\nAvicenna introduces two radical innovations in the Aristotelian\nanalysis of propositions.\n\nTemporal and alethic modalities: every categorical\nproposition is modalized, either implicitly or explicitly. The\nmodality may be either temporal (e.g., sometime, always), alethic\n(e.g., necessarily, possibly), or a combination of both. This has\nsignificant repercussions on the traditional Aristotelian square of\nopposition, which Avicenna rejects as we shall see below, and on the\naccount of conversion.\nReferential/substantial and descriptional reading: every\ncategorical proposition is subject to an additional reading, depending\non whether the proposition is taken to express a relation between the\npredicate and what is picked out by the subject, (a) as long as what\nis picked out by the subject exists (m\u0101 d\u0101ma\nmaw\u011f\u016bd a\u1e0f-\u1e0f\u0101t) or (b) as long as it is\nqualified\u2014or \u201cdescribed\u201d (m\u0101 d\u0101ma\nmaw\u1e63\u016bf)\u2014by the subject. This move amounts to\nadding a temporal parameter that identifies two distinct time frames:\nthe continued existence of the item picked out by the subject term\n(where the subject term is used, as it were, just to fix the\nreferent), and the time at which such an item is actually qualified by\nthe subject term.

In the first case, the\nconnection is analyzed in terms of a relation of following\n(ittib\u0101\u02bf) between an antecedent (muqaddam)\nand a consequent\n (t\u0101lin).[5]\n In the second case, conflict is expressed in terms of a disjunction\nof propositions (or parts, a\u011fz\u0101\u02be).\n\nThe resulting propositional types are conditionals\n(mutta\u1e63il\u0101t) and disjunctions\n(munfa\u1e63il\u0101t). Avicenna investigates them both with\nrespect to basic logical relations\u2014such as contradiction,\nsubalternation, mutual implication, or conversion\u2014and within the context of\nsyllogistic inferences.\n\nA distinctive feature of Avicenna\u2019s analysis of hypothetical\npropositions is quantification. The conditional relation between\nantecedent and consequent as well as the relation of conflict between\nthe parts of a disjunction are embedded within the scope of a\nquantifier which may express a universal affirmative, a universal\nnegative, a particular affirmative, or a particular negative\nhypothetical proposition.\n\nThe question with respect to what conditional and disjunctive\nstatements are quantified may elicit different answers. In the case of\nconditional statements, Avicenna indicates that the quantification\nshould be understood to apply to the times at which the antecedent is\nposited and the states or conditions (in short, additional\nassumptions) that can be associated with it. The problem is addressed\nfor example by (Rescher 1963b), (Movahed 2009), and (Hodges 2013). A\nuniversal affirmative conditional statement is true when the\nconsequent follows the antecedent at all times the antecedent is\nposited and with respect to all states that may legitimately be added\nto the\n antecedent:[6]\n\n\n\nIf the connection (itti\u1e63\u0101l) is asserted under any\ncondition and circumstance (\u02bfal\u0101 kull\ni\u0161tir\u0101\u1e6d wa-wa\u1e0d\u02bf) [at which the\nantecedent] is posited, then the hypothetical conditional proposition\nis universal; (Qiy\u0101s V.4, 263.1\u2013264.2) \n\nIn the statement \u201cAlways, if C is B, then H is Z\u201d the\nwords \u201calways, if\u201d are not only meant to cover what is\n[explicitly] intended (al-mur\u0101d) [by this proposition],\nin such a way that it is as if one were to say \u201cEvery time at\nwhich C is B, H is Z\u201d. Rather, [the words \u201calways,\nif\u201d] are also meant to cover every state\n(\u1e25\u0101l) which may be added to the statement\n\u201cEvery C is B\u201d, in such a way that there is no state\n(\u1e25\u0101l) or condition (\u0161ar\u1e6d)\nwhatsoever that makes C to be B without making H to be Z, when it is\nadded to [the antecedent \u201cC is B\u201d]. (Qiy\u0101s, V.4, 265.1\u20135)[7]\n\n\nA classification of hypothetical propositions is given at the\nbeginning of Qiy\u0101s V.3, where Avicenna explicitly lists\na first set of permutations and illustrates them with examples. There\nseems to be no principled reason to think that Avicenna would not have\nentertained the possibility of more complex iterations (where, for\ninstance, the antecedent of a conditional is itself a conditional\nwhose antecedent is a disjunction of conditionals whose consequents\nare conditionals consisting of categoricals). A hint in this direction\nis that he is prepared to entertain the notion of potentially infinite\ndisjunctions.\n3.2.1 Types of hypotheticals\n\nAvicenna considers the following types of hypothetical propositions in\nQiy\u0101s V.3:\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional \nDisjunctive  \n\n(i)\ncat-cat \n[categorical] \u2192 [categorical] \n[categorical] \u2228 [categorical]  \n\n(ii)\nc-c\n(\u2026\u2192 \u2026) \u2192 (\u2026 \u2192 \u2026)\n( \u2026 \u2192 \u2026) \u2228 ( \u2026 \u2192 \u2026)\n \n\n(iii) \nd-d \n(\u2026 \u2228 \u2026) \u2192 (\u2026 \u2228 \u2026) \n( \u2026 \u2228 \u2026) \u2228 ( \u2026 \u2228 \u2026) \n\n\n(iv) \nc-d \n(\u2026 \u2192 \u2026) \u2192 (\u2026 \u2228 \u2026) \n(\u2026 \u2192 \u2026) \u2228 (\u2026 \u2228\n\u2026)  \n\n(\u2026 \u2228 \u2026)\n\u2192 (\u2026 \u2192 \u2026)  \n\n(v) \ncat-c \n[categorical] \u2192 (\u2026 \u2192 \u2026) \n(\u2026 \u2192 \u2026) \u2228 [categorical] \n\n\n(\u2026 \u2192 \u2026)\n\u2192 [categorical]  \n\n(vi) \ncat-d \n[categorical] \u2192 (\u2026 \u2228 \u2026) \n(\u2026 \u2228 \u2026) \u2228 [categorical] \n\n\n(\u2026 \u2228 \u2026)\n\u2192 [categorical]  \n\n\n\nThe first type comprises the most basic kind of hypothetical\npropositions, which take categorical propositions as their parts. The\nhypotheticals discussed in the development of the hypothetical\nsyllogistic in Qiy\u0101s VI are of type (i) only. That is to\nsay, the premise-pairs of hypothetical syllogisms are either type-(i)\npropositions (conditional-conditional; conditional-disjunctive;\ndisjunctive-disjunctive); or combinations of type (i) propositions\nwith categoricals (conditional-categorical; disjunctive-categorical).\nThe former class comprises purely hypothetical syllogisms, the latter\nmixed hypothetical syllogisms.\n\nAvicenna illustrates the above types by means of the following\nexamples (Qiy\u0101s V.3, 253.1\u2013255.2):\n\n\n\n \n \nConditional \nDisjunctive  \n\n(i) \ncat-cat \nIf [the sun rises], then [it\nis day] \nEither [this number is even]\nor [<this number> is odd]  \n\n(ii) \nc-c \nIf (always if [it is day], then [the sun has\nrisen]), then (always if [it is night], then [the sun\nhas set]) \nEither (always if [the sun rises], then [it is\nday]) or (sometimes if [the sun rises], then [it is\nnot day])  \n\n(iii) \nd-d \nIf (either [the body is at rest] or [<the\nbody is> in motion]), then (either [some substances\nare at rest] or [<they are> in motion]) \nEither (either [this fever is yellowish] or\n[<this fever is> scarlet]) or (either [this\nfever is phlegmish] or [<this fever is> melancholic]) \n\n\n(iv) \nc-d \nIf (always if [the sun rises], then [it is\nday]), then (either [it is day] or [the sun has not\nrisen]) \nEither (if [the sun rises], then\n[it is day]) or (either [the sun rises] or [it is\nday])  \n\nIf (either\n[this number is even] or [<this number> is odd]),\nthen (if [<this number> is even] then [<this\nnumber> is not odd])  \n\n(v) \ncat-c \nIf [the sun is the cause of day],\nthen (always if [it is day], then [the sun has\nrisen]) \nEither (always if [it is day], then\n[the sun has risen]) or [the sun is not the cause of\nday]  \n\nIf (always\nif [it is day], then [the sun has risen]), then [the\nsun is the cause of day]  \n\n(vi) \ncat-d \nIf [this is a number], then\n(either [this is even] or [<this is> odd]) \nEither (either [this is even] or\n[<this is> odd]) or [<this> is not a\nnumber]  \n\nIf (either\n[this is even] or [<this is> odd]), then [this\nis a number]  \n\n\n3.2.2 Types of following\n\nConditionals express relations of following between an antecedent and\na consequent. Complete conditionals are bi-conditionals.\n\nAvicenna distinguishes between two types of conditionals: implicative\n(luz\u016bm\u012b) and coincidental\n(ittif\u0101q\u012b). While the former express\nnecessary relations of following whereby the consequent follows\nbecause or in virtue of the antecedent, the latter have often been\nthought to express an accidental connection, though it seems plausible\nthat Avicenna might simply mean agreement or coincidence\nin truth or in being the\n case together (ma\u02bfiyya).[8]\n When a conditional expresses an implication (luz\u016bm), it\nis called real (\u1e25aq\u012bq\u012b or \u02bfal\u0101\nt-ta\u1e25q\u012bq); when it expresses coincidence\n(ittif\u0101q, muw\u0101faqa or\ntaw\u0101fuq), it is called unqualified (mu\u1e6dlaq\nor \u02bfal\u0101 l-i\u1e6dl\u0101q). For a characterization\nof conditionals see (Karimullah 2014a).\n3.2.3 Types of conflict\n\nAvicenna distinguishes among three types of disjunctive statements:\n(i) exclusive and exhaustive; (ii) exclusive non-exhaustive; (iii)\ninclusive. Put simply, their characteristic properties may be expressed in terms of the\nfollowing three relations:\n\n \\(p \\lor^{1} q\\) with \\(p \\leftrightarrow \\neg q\\)\n \\(p \\lor^{2} q\\) with \\(p \\rightarrow \\neg q\\)\n \\(p \\lor^{3} q\\) with \\(\\neg p \\rightarrow q\\)\n\n\nAvicenna refers to the first type as the real (or genuine) disjunction\n(munfa\u1e63ila \u1e25aq\u012bqiyya) and to the other two\ntypes as unreal (\u0121ayr \u1e25aq\u012bq\u012b)\ndisjunctions. The second and third type were canonically referred to\nby Post-Avicennan logicians as the m\u0101ni\u02bfat\nal-\u011fam\u02bf disjunction (preventing the joint affirmation\nof the two disjuncts, i.e., compatible with their both being false\ntogether but incompatible with their both being true together) and the\nm\u0101ni\u02bfat al-\u1e2buluww disjunction (preventing the\njoint negation of the two disjuncts, i.e., compatible with their both\nbeing true together but incompatible with their both being false\ntogether) (El-Rouayheb 2010).\n\nNegative disjunctions express absence of conflict or\nincompatibility.\n3.2.4 Truth-conditions for conditionals\n\nImplicative conditionals are true (1.1) when the antecedent and the\nconsequent are both true or (1.2) when the antecedent is false and the\nconsequent is true or (1.3) when the antecedent and the consequent are\nboth false, and (2) there is a connection of meaning between the two\nsuch that the consequent is inseparable from the antecedent.\n\nCoincidental conditionals are true when the antecedent and the\nconsequent are both true or when the antecedent is false and the\nconsequent is true (but false when both the antecedent and the\nconsequent are false).\n\nBoth conditionals are false when the antecedent is true and the\nconsequent is false. Implicative conditionals with true antecedents\nand consequents are also true as coincidental. The question how the\ntwo are related more generally and without such restrictions is in\nneed of further investigation.\n\nNegative universal (particular) conditionals express the fact the consequent does not necessarily follow from the antecedent (luz\u016bm\u012b) or is not true together with the antecedent (ittif\u0101q\u012b) at any (some) times and under any (some) circumstances. They are equivalent to affirmative conditionals of the\nsame quantity with a contradictory consequent and express the dual\nrelation of dependency (or togetherness) of the contradictory of the consequent with respect to the\nantecedent at all (some) times and under all (some) circumstances. For\nexample, a universal negative conditional of the form \u201cNever, if\nA is B, then C is D\u201d is logically equivalent to \u201cAlways,\nif A is B, then C is not D\u201d. Negative conditional statements may\nexpress absence of a luz\u016bm\u012b connection (as in\n\u201cNever, if man exists, then void does not exist\u201d) or\nabsence of an ittif\u0101q\u012b connection (as in\n\u201cNever, if man exists, then void exists\u201d)\n(Qiy\u0101s V.5, 279.1\u2013283.9).\n3.2.5 Impossible antecedents\n\nAvicenna is keenly interested in conditionals with impossible\nantecedents (sophisticated discussions are to be found in his account\nof a- and e-conditionals and in connection with reductio\narguments) but only in the sense in which an impossibility may genuinely be derived from another impossibility, as it were, out of the meaning of the terms involved,\nnot in the sense in which an arbitrary consequent may trivially be inferred from\nan impossible antecedent. The problem of explosion is recognized and\nrejected in post-Avicennan logic, starting with\n\u1e2a\u016bna\u011f\u012b (d. 1248 CE). It seems reasonable to assume, even in\nthe current state of our fragmentary knowledge of such a vast amount of material,\nthat both Avicenna\u2019s logic and post-Avicennan logic may\ngenerally be committed to an idea of logical consequence that could perhaps\nbest be captured, in modern terms, by the intuition behind a\nrelevantist approach to the notion of following. This is\na feature that the Arabic tradition would share with certain strands\nof medieval Latin logic. In discussing the problem of conditionals\nwith impossible antecedents in the post-Avicennan tradition\n(El-Rouayheb 2009 and 2010: xxxiii\u2013xl) argues for an even stronger\ninterpretation in terms of connexive\n logic.[9]\n4. Contradiction and Conversion\n\nContradiction (tan\u0101qu\u1e0d) and conversion\n(\u02bfaks) are fundamental relations in Avicenna\u2019s\nlogic. The principles that govern them are central in the development\nof the syllogistic, both categorical and hypothetical. It is not\nsurprising, in light of the complexity of Avicenna\u2019s analysis of\ncategorical propositions and of his elaborate account of quantified\nhypotheticals, that his answers to questions such as what contradicts\nwhat, what follows from what, and what converts with what all\ncame under close scrutiny in Post-Avicennan logic, before finding a\nstable equilibrium with K\u0101tib\u012b (d. 1276 CE), an equilibrium that turns\nin several key respects on the interpretation of these relations.\n4.1 Contradiction of Categorical Propositions\n\nThe logical relations usually expressed in the Aristotelian square of\nopposition for assertoric propositions and its modal counterparts\nbecome the object of a significant revision in Avicenna\u2019s\nsystem, as a result of the richer set of propositions it comprises.\nPerhaps the most striking feature is the replacement of the\nAristotelian assertoric with the one-sided absolute (X1),\na proposition containing an\nimplicit temporal modality (\u201csometimes\u201d or \u201cat least\nonce\u201d) which, unlike the Aristotelian assertoric, is not\ncontradicted by a proposition of the same kind, but by a stronger\nproposition, namely the \u201cperpetual\u201d\n(d\u0101\u02beima) A-proposition.\n\nBelow is a summary of the relations of entailment (including subalternation) and contradiction for four basic types of propositions, all one-sided, in\nthe referential/substantial reading; in the case of two-sided propositions,\ncontradictories are disjunctive statements or involve a disjunctive\npredicate (the latter only applies to two-sided possibility propositions):\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Referential/substantial necessity,\nperpetuity, general absoluteness, and general possibility:\nentailment and contradiction\n\n\nThe following are analogous relations among propositions in the\ndescriptional reading:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Descriptional necessity,\nperpetuity, general absoluteness, and general possibility:\nentailment and contradiction \n\n\nThe above relations are central in syllogistic proofs by\nreductio.\n4.2 Contradiction of Hypothetical Propositions\n\nIn the case of hypothetical propositions, contradiction is determined\nonly with respect to the main quantifier of the conditional or the\ndisjunction and does not affect the component statements. In other\nwords, it should not be confused with another relation involving\nnegation, namely mutual implication (tal\u0101zum). The\ncontradictory of a conditional a-proposition is a conditional\no-proposition with the same antecedent and consequent and the\ncontradictory of a conditional e-proposition is a conditional\ni-proposition with the same antecedent and consequent. The same\napplies to the case of disjunctions.\n\nAvicenna is keen to point out on various occasions throughout the\ntreatment of conditionals in the Qiy\u0101s that what matters\nare the quantificational aspects of the relation between\nantecedent and consequent (the nisba or the\n\u1e25ukm), not the quantity and quality of the antecedent\nand consequent themselves. In particular, he vigorously rejects the\nview that the contradictory of a conditional statement is a\nconditional statement of the same quality and quantity whose\nconsequent is denied. In his view, the contradictory of (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa is\n (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa, not (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ao. In other words, \u201cAlways, if every A is B,\nthen every C is D\u201d is contradicted by \u201cNot always, if every A is\nB, then every C is D\u201d and not by \u201cAlways, if every A is B, then not every C is D\u201d which is in fact a stronger statement equivalent to its contrary, namely  (e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa (\u201cNever, if every A is B, then every C is D\u201d).[10]\nOn the other hand, (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa is logically equivalent to (i-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ao\n(\u201cSometimes, if every A is B, then not every C is D\u201d),\nwhich is therefore another contradictory of (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa. A set of basic relations is represented in the\nfollowing diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Relations among conditionals: mutual implication, subalternation, contrariety, and contradiction) \n\n4.3 Conversion of Categorical Propositions\n\n(Some of) the rules of conversion for categorical propositions\nconstitute another major departure from Aristotle. On Avicenna\u2019s\nmodel, the absolute universal negative proposition, X1-e,\nfails to convert due to its being\na one-sided temporal proposition (in general it is not true that if no\nA is always B, then no B is always A, as in \u201cNo animal always\nsleeps\u201d and \u201cNothing that sleeps is always an\nanimal\u201d). L-a and L-i\npropositions do not convert as L-i\npropositions but rather as M1-i\npropositions (for a general\npresentation and an account of the proofs see Street 2002, Thom 2003).\nL-e and Ld1-e\npropositions convert as such. In\nthe first case, the proof is one of the most controversial points in\nAvicenna\u2019s system, directly connected with the validity of\nfirst-figure syllogisms with a one-sided possibility, M1,\nminor premise. The conversion of\nLd1-propositions as Ld1-propositions is in fact the minimal\nessential requirement for the productivity of second-figure moods\ninvolving absolutes in XX and XM mixes. For Avicenna\u2019s account of why an Ld1-proposition\nmay legitimately be regarded as an\nabsolute proposition, see Qiy\u0101s I.4 and Burh\u0101n II.1, discussed in (Strobino\nforthcoming).\n4.4 Conversion of Hypothetical Propositions\n\nThe conversion of hypothetical propositions is explicitly discussed\nonly in a short chapter of the Qiy\u0101s (VII.3), where\nAvicenna briefly talks about the status of (e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)) propositions\n(conversion does not apply in a genuine sense to disjunctions, whose parts are equivalent: \u201cAlways, either every A is B or C is\nD\u201d is the same statement as \u201cAlways, either every C is D\nor every A is B\u201d). This, however, should not suggest that\nconversion is less important in the case of hypotheticals than it is\nin the case of categoricals: it is in fact an essential method of proof for\ncertain hypothetical syllogisms. Additional rules may be extrapolated from the\nextensive discussions of syllogisms involving conditionals in\nQiy\u0101s VI.1, VI.2, and VI.4.\n\nIn the conversion of conditional propositions, the parameters that matter are the\nquantity of the proposition to be converted and that of its\nconverse, and the type of conditional (luz\u016bm\u012b or\nittif\u0101q\u012b), while the antecedent and the consequent are\ntreated in a way analogous to the way in which terms are treated in\nthe conversion of categoricals. The following are notable as well as\nfrequently used conversion principles: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\eC^{i})pq & \u22a2 (\\eC^{i})qp & (\\textit{Qiy\u0101s}, \\textrm{ VII.3}) \\\\\n(\\aC)pq & \u22a2 (\\iC)qp\\\\\n(\\iC)pq & \u22a2 (\\iC)qp \n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n4.5 Inferential Relations among Hypotheticals\n\nThe analysis of inferential relations among hypotheticals includes the\nmutual implication (tal\u0101zum) of (i) conditional\nstatements and (ii) disjunctive statements, as well as (iii) the interaction\nbetween the two classes of hypotheticals. Besides its intrinsic interest, such an analysis is\noften required for the proof validity of hypothetical syllogisms, in addition\nto standard techniques such as conversion, ecthesis\n(iftir\u0101\u1e0d), and reductio. The treatment of\nconditionals is found in Qiy\u0101s VII.1, while\nQiy\u0101s VII.2 is devoted to the analysis of disjunctions\nand the connection between the two.\n4.5.1 Conditionals\n\nIn Qiy\u0101s VII.1, Avicenna considers a basic set of\nquantified conditional statements with quantified antecedents and\nconsequents. Assuming the four basic forms of quantified conditional\nstatements (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)), (e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)), (i-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)), and (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)) and all permutations of a-,\ne-, i-, o-propositions as antecedents and consequents, Avicenna\ngenerates four groups of sixteen conditional propositions (see\n Appendix B)\n and argues that any of those forms is logically equivalent to the\ncontradictory conditional with a contradictory consequent, based on a\nreductio proof that may easily be generalized. As\nillustrated above (contradiction of conditional propositions), the\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa proposition is for instance equivalent to the (e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ao\nproposition (\u201cAlways, if every A is B, then every C is D\u201d\nif and only if \u201cNever, if every A is B, then not every C is\nD\u201d). If that were not the case, then (i-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ao would be true. But\nthen (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa would be true, which contradicts the initial assumption.\nFor an account of Avicenna\u2019s reductio proof of the fact\nthat \u201cAlways, if every A is B, then every C is D\u201d implies\n\u201cNever, if every A is B, then not every C is D\u201d\u2014at\nQiy\u0101s 367.11\u2013368.1\u2014see (El-Rouayheb 2009:\n209\u2013210 and 2010:\n xxxiii\u2013xxxiv).[11]\n4.5.2 Disjunctions\n\nThe scheme of classification of disjunctive propositions is analogous\nto that of conditionals. Disjunctive statements consisting of two\nparts are quantified as a-, e-, i-, and o-propositions (where negative\npropositions express absence of conflict or incompatibility between\nthe disjuncts at all (some) times and under all (some) circumstances)\nwith sixteen permutations for each case depending on the quality and\nquantity of the parts (see\n Appendix B).\nIn this case, however, the situation is complicated by the fact that\ndifferent types of disjunctions have different logical properties,\nwith specific considerations applying to each type. Besides, in the\nschematic representations offered below, I prefer to retain the\nquantificational features of the disjuncts, as Avicenna seems to\ndifferentiate explicitly between real and unreal disjunctions in\nvirtue, among other things, of their having affirmative or negative\nparts, another point that deserves more attention (for a preliminary\nanalysis see Street 1995). In general, for Avicenna disjunctions and\nconditionals are not inter-definable without qualification.\n\n\n\nAvicenna addresses the relation between disjunctions and conditionals\nfirst. The main distinction is between the case in which the\ndisjunction is (i) real (exclusive and exhaustive) and the case in\nwhich it is (ii) unreal (to be taken here in the sense of inclusive).[12] \nIn case (i), the negation of a disjunct implies the affirmation of the other disjunct and the affirmation of a disjunct implies the negation of the other disjunct. In case (ii), the negation of a disjunct implies the affirmation of the other disjunct, but the affirmation of a disjunct does not imply the negation of the other disjunct. Thus, for instance the following\nrelations hold, as instances of the schemata \\((\\aD^1)pq \\rightarrow\n(\\aC)\\neg pq\\) and \\((\\aD^1)pq \\rightarrow (\\aC)p\\neg q\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\aD^{1})\\ra^{1}\\ra^{2} & \\rightarrow (\\aC)\\ro^{1}\\ra^{2 }\\\\\n(\\aD^{1})\\ra^{1}\\ra^{2} & \\rightarrow^{ } (\\aC)\\ro^{2}\\ra^{1}\\\\\n(\\aD^{1})\\ra^{1}\\ra^{2} & \\rightarrow (\\aC)\\ra^{1}\\ro^{2 }\\\\\n(\\aD^{1})\\ra^{1}\\ra^{2} & \\rightarrow (\\aC)\\ra^{2}\\ro^{1}\n  \\end{align}\n  \\]\n\n\nBy contrast, if the disjunction is unreal (inclusive), only the\nfollowing relations hold: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\aD^{3})\\ra^{1}\\ra^{2} & \\rightarrow (\\aC)\\ro^{1}\\ra^{2 }\\\\\n(\\aD^{3})\\ra^{1}\\ra^{2} & \\rightarrow^{ } (\\aC)\\ro^{2}\\ra^{1}\n  \\end{align}\n  \\]\n\n \n\n\nIn analogy with the case of conditionals, Avicenna also discusses\ninferential relations among disjunctions (Qiy\u0101s VII.2,\n379.17\u2013381.10), where notable cases are, for real affirmative\ndisjunctions with affirmative parts: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\aD^{1})\\ra^{1}\\ra^{2} & \\rightarrow (\\eD)\\ro^{1}\\ra^{2}\\\\\n(\\aD^{1})\\ra^{1}\\ra^{2} & \\rightarrow (\\eD)\\ro^{2}\\ra^{1}\n  \\end{align}\n  \\]\n\n\nThus, an exclusive and exhaustive universal affirmative disjunction\nentails a proposition that expresses universal absence of conflict\nbetween one of the disjuncts and the contradictory of the other\n(\u201cfrom \u2018Always either every A is B or every C is D\u2019\none can infer \u2018Never either not every A is B or every C is\nD\u2019 and \u2018Never either not every C is D or every A is\nB\u2019\u201d, Qiy\u0101s VII.2, 380.1\u20134). The converse is\nnot generally true, as the negative disjunction may be true in virtue of\nan impossible disjunct that is not in conflict with the other\n(according to the semantics of negative disjunctions discussed in\nQiy\u0101s V.5). The same holds for (i-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)1) and\n(o-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)1) propositions. \n\n\nThe relations among disjunctions and conditionals, a theme of obvious\ninterest from the standpoint of modern logic, reflect the complexity\nof the above distinctions. Avicenna investigates relations such as,\nfor instance, the triangulation between (a-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)),\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)), and (e-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)) propositions\n(Qiy\u0101s VII.2, 381.11\u201317):\n\n\n \n\n\nThis is only an example of a more complex network of inferential\nrelations that should be complemented with an exhaustive list and an\naccurate analysis of the inferences used in the treatment of\nsyllogisms, especially in Qiy\u0101s VI.\n5. Syllogistic\n\nThe culmination of Avicenna\u2019s formal logic is the development of\nan elaborate theory of the syllogism that brings together various\nstrands from ancient and late ancient logic, filtered through\nPeripatetic lenses, and produces a new and original system.\n\nThe theory of the syllogism (qiy\u0101s), in its main\ndivisions, occupies a prominent part in all of Avicenna\u2019s\nlogical works. The doctrinal skeleton remains the same in spite of a\nsignificant re-arrangement of the material, especially in the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t. In the works of the middle period,\nespecially the Na\u011f\u0101t and the extensive treatment of the\nQiy\u0101s, Avicenna follows the path charted by the\nPrior\n Analytics.[13]\nTypes of syllogisms: connective and repetitive\n\nAmong the several innovations Avicenna may be credited with is the\ncodification of a canonical division, echoing distinctions already\nbrewing in ancient and late ancient logic, of syllogisms in a number\nof categories that became standard conceptual vocabulary in later\nArabic logic.\n\nSyllogisms divide into two main types: (1) connective syllogisms\n(iqtir\u0101n\u012b) and (2) repetitive syllogisms\n(isti\u1e6fn\u0101\u02be\u012b).\n\nConnective syllogisms are defined as those in which neither the\nconclusion nor its contradictory is explicitly part of the premises,\nand hence as those syllogisms in which the conclusion is only\npotentially contained in the premises. Connective syllogisms are\ncharacterized by a partial overlap or sharing between the premises (of\na middle term or of a proposition discharged in the conclusion).\n\nRepetitive syllogisms are defined as those in which either the\nconclusion or its contradictory is explicitly part of the\npremises.\n\nFurther discussion of syllogistic arguments include the (i) compound\nsyllogism (qiy\u0101s murakkab), which involves multiple\nsyllogisms such that the conclusion of a syllogism serves as a premise for\nthe next syllogism, whether by an explicit concatenation\n(maw\u1e63\u016bl) or an implicit one\n(mufa\u1e63\u1e63al), as well as other forms that came to\nbe discussed, in later Arabic logic, under the rubric of concomitants\nof the syllogism (law\u0101\u1e25iq al-qiy\u0101s). These\nvariously connect to chapters of the Prior Analytics and include:\n(ii) the proof through the impossible or reductio ad absurdum\n(qiy\u0101s al-\u1e2balf or kal\u0101m il\u0101\nl-mu\u1e25\u0101l), which in Avicenna is interestingly\nanalyzed in terms of a combination of a connective and a repetitive\nsyllogism, (iii) the conversion of the syllogism (\u02bfaks\nal-qiy\u0101s), (iv) the syllogism from opposites (qiy\u0101s\u0101t mu\u02beallafa min muqaddam\u0101t mut\u0101qabila), and (v)\ncircular proof (bay\u0101n ad-dawr).\n5.1 Connective Syllogistic\n\nConnective syllogisms are divided into two main types: (1) categorical\n(\u1e25aml\u012b) and (2) hypothetical\n(\u0161ar\u1e6d\u012b) syllogisms.\n\n(1) Categorical syllogisms are those whose premises and conclusions\nare all and only categorical propositions. Their treatment constitutes\none of Avicenna\u2019s most original contributions. It follows paths\nand adopts techniques that are familiar in the Aristotelian tradition\nbut the resulting system is original and based on distinctive\nintuitions, largely due to the sophisticated understanding of modality\nthat emerges in the analysis of propositions.\n\n(2) The hypothetical syllogistic is a new development, at least with\nrespect to Aristotle. Although the model is likely indebted to late\nancient Greek sources, the genuinely innovative character of its\nconstituent elements (quantified hypothetical propositions) turns this\narea into something rather different from its most natural Greek\n(Galen) or Latin (most notably Boethius) terms of comparison, even\nleaving aside other differences.\n\nThe hypothetical syllogistic investigates arguments in which at least one\nof the premises is a hypothetical proposition (of type (i), namely one\nwhose parts are themselves categoricals, though Avicenna does not seem\nto put any restriction on more complex argument forms). Purely hypothetical\nsyllogisms are those in which the combination of the premises involve\nonly hypotheticals (conditional-conditional;\nconditional-disjunction; disjunction-disjunction). Mixed hypothetical\nsyllogisms are those in which the combination of the premises involves\na hypothetical (conditional or disjunction) and a categorical.\n\nThe extent to which hypothetical syllogisms are treated in\nAvicenna\u2019s various logical works varies significantly. A great\ndeal of material is left out of the abridged treatments (for instance\nin the Na\u011f\u0101t and in the I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t)\ncompared to the extensive analysis provided in the Qiy\u0101s\n(and to that promised but never delivered\u2014as far as we\nknow\u2014in the frequently announced Kit\u0101b\nal-Law\u0101\u1e25iq, the Book of the Appendices). The\ncriteria of selection are not just pragmatic (hypothetical syllogisms\nare significantly more complex, if only in virtue of the compounding\neffect generated by an additional layer of quantification) but also\nbased on the idea that some combinations are more natural (perhaps\nmore intuitive) than others.\n\nThe entire edifice of Avicenna\u2019s connective syllogistic rests on the assumption that certain argument forms are self-evidently productive\n(bayyina, bayyina bi-anfusih\u0101, bayyinat\nal-int\u0101\u011f) or perfect (k\u0101mila) and that all\nother forms can be reduced (ru\u011f\u016b\u02bf) to them by\nstandard methods of proof. The latter include (i) proofs based on\nconversion (\u02bfaks) (alongside other kinds of\ntransformation of premises or conclusions into logically equivalent premises or\nconclusions, in the case of hypothetical syllogisms), (ii) proofs\nbased on setting out a term (iftir\u0101\u1e0d)\u2014the\ncounterpart of the Aristotelian notion of ecthesis, and (iii) proofs\nthrough the impossible (or reductio ad absurdum,\nqiy\u0101s al-\u1e2balf). Depending on the circumstances,\none, two or all three methods may be used to prove productivity.\n5.1.1 Categorical syllogistic\n\nCategorical syllogisms are argument forms consisting of triplets of\nterms (\u1e25ud\u016bd) arranged in two premises\n(muqaddam\u0101t) and a conclusion (nat\u012b\u011fa\nor, insofar as it is implicitly contained in or aimed at by the premises,\nma\u1e6dl\u016bb). The two premises share a term with one\nanother and one each with the conclusion, for example, \u201cEvery B\nis C; every A is B; therefore every A is C\u201d (BaC,\nAaB \u22a2 AaC). The term shared by the premises is\ncalled middle term (\u1e25add awsa\u1e6d). The subject of\nthe conclusion is called minor term (\u1e25add\na\u1e63\u0121ar), the predicate of the conclusion is called\nmajor term (\u1e25add akbar). The premise that shares with\nthe conclusion the minor term is called minor premise (muqaddama\n\u1e63u\u0121r\u0101). The premise that shares with the\nconclusion the major term is called major premise (muqaddama\nkubr\u0101).\nFigures and moods\n\nThe middle term may be (i) subject of the major premise and predicate\nof the minor premise; (ii) predicate of both; or (iii) subject of\nboth. The resulting configurations are called (i) first figure\n(\u0161akl awwal), (ii) second figure (\u0161akl\n\u1e6f\u0101nin), and (iii) third figure (\u0161akl\n\u1e6f\u0101li\u1e6f). Like Aristotle, Avicenna does not\ncontemplate a fourth\n figure.[14]\n Each figure contains a number of valid moods\n(\u1e0dur\u016bb), identified by the quantity, quality, and\nmodality of the premises and conclusion. For the sake of simplicity, I\nuse standard vocabulary for the treatment of the Aristotelian syllogistic\n(in particular the list of mnemonic tags developed in the Latin middle\nages for the identification of\n moods).[15]\n The moods of the first figure are Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio.\nThe moods of the second figure are Cesare, Camestres, Festino, Baroco.\nThe moods of the third figure are Darapti, Felapton, Datisi, Disamis,\nBocardo, and Ferison. Each of the above will be productive with\ncertain combinations of modalized premises and not with others.\n\nThe discussion of productive moods in the Qiy\u0101s and in the\nNa\u011f\u0101t follows the order and method of presentation\nof the Prior Analytics and focuses on different modal mixes\n(i\u1e2btil\u0101\u1e6d\u0101t) that are then distinguished\nby figure (for example, the LX or the LM combinations in the first,\nsecond, and third figure). In the I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t\nAvicenna chooses a different approach and discusses productivity by\nfigure, not by mix. This enables him to present more effectively a\nnumber of general principles governing inferences in each figure, and\nmost importantly modifications to the so-called rule of the major for\nthe first figure (Street forthcoming). The rule of the major tells us\nthat the modality of the conclusion in first-figure syllogisms follows\nthe modality of the major premise, except in two cases that will be\ndiscussed below (Ld1LL and XMM).  Given the logical\npriority ascribed by Avicenna to the first figure, this move\nrepresents a significant gain in terms of simplicity.\n\nBelow is a schematic summary of the productive combinations of\nmodalized premises in each figure (the combinations in square brackets\nare productive but not always explicitly identified by Avicenna).\n\n\n\n \nXX\nLL \nLX \nMM \nMX \nML  \n\nFirst\n\nfigure \nXXX\n\n[XXM] \nLLL\n\n[LLM] \nLXL\n\nXLX\n\nLd1LL \nMMM \nMXM\n\nXMM\n\n[XMX]\n\n[MXX] \nLML\n\nMLM\n\n[LMM]  \n\nSecond\n\nfigure \nonly with\n\nX converting as itself \nLLL \nLXL\n\nXLL \nno moods \nonly with\n\nX converting as itself  \nLML\n\nMLL\n\n[LMM]\n\n[MLM]  \n\nThird\n\nfigure \nXXX\n\n[XXM] \nLLL \nLXL\n\nXLX \nMMM \nMXM\n\nXMM\n\n[XMX]\n\n[XXM]\n\n[MXX] \nLML\n\nMLM\n\n[LMM]  \n\n\n\nIn the first figure, according to the terse account offered in the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t, if the minor premise is an actuality\nproposition (X\nor L), the conclusion follows the modality\nof the major (X, L\nor M). There are, however, two exceptions in\nwhich the conclusion follows the modality of the minor premise. The\nfirst exception is Ld1LL, where the major is a\ndescriptional necessity proposition and the conclusion, like the\nminor, is an L-proposition (stronger than\nthe major). The second exception is XMM, where the major is an\nabsolute proposition and the conclusion, like the minor, is\nan M-proposition proposition (weaker than\nthe major). In the remaining two cases in which the minor is\nan M-proposition, namely MMM and LML, the\nrule of the major applies.\n\nMMM and MLM moods in the first figure are perfect (Qiy\u0101s\nIV.1, 181.2\u20134, 184.3\u20136, and IV.3, 199.5\u20136, where the\nlatter are explicitly characterized as instances of the maq\u016bl\n\u02bfal\u0101 l-kull or dictum de omni). LML moods, by\ncontrast, require proof.\n\nSome of the most interesting (and problematic) aspects of\nAvicenna\u2019s modal logic emerge in connection with the proofs used\nto establish the productivity of certain notable moods.  For instance,\nthe controversial idea that the possible may be assumed to be actual\nin the context of a reductio proof (as well as in the proof\nof e-conversion of necessity propositions) is justified by intuitions\nthat have sparked heated controversies in the post-Avicennan tradition\n(similar issues arise in the Greek tradition; for a philosophical\ninterpretation of this technique, see Malink & Rosen\n2013). Another problem is the potential circularity of the proof of\nBarbara LML, which, even if we leave aside the issue of assuming the\npossible to be actual, seems to rest on Baroco LXL, which in turn\ndepends on Barbara LML (Street 2002).\n\nA crucial intuition that lies at the core of Avicenna\u2019s\nunderstanding of modality is connected with the different readings\nintroduced above (referential/substantial and descriptional). If a\nproperty holds necessarily of something (picked out by the middle\nterm) under the referential/substantial reading, then it also\nnecessarily holds of whatever the middle term may be true of: \n\n\nIn sum, be aware of the fact that that for which it is possible to be\nnecessary is always necessary (m\u0101 yumkinu an\nya\u1e63\u012bra \u1e0dar\u016briyyan fa-huwa \u1e0dar\u016briyyun\nd\u0101\u02beiman) and that it may [also] be possible in the more\ngeneral sense (wa-amkanah\u016b l-imk\u0101n\nal-a\u02bf\u0101mm). (Qiy\u0101s IV.3, 203.4\u20135)\n\n\n\nA similar line of reasoning applies to the case of LXL moods\n(Qiy\u0101s IV.3, 202, Na\u011f\u0101t 71) and,\nmutatis mutandis, to Ld1LL\nmoods with regard to the minor\npremise.\n\nAvicenna explicitly formulates a generalized modal version of the\ndictum de omni at Qiy\u0101s IV.1, 184.3\u20135:\n\n\n\nWhat possibly holds of what possibly holds [of something] possibly\nholds of [that something] in an evident way (mumkin al-mumkin\nmumkin \u1e93\u0101hir al-imk\u0101n), just as what necessarily\nholds of what necessarily holds [of something] necessarily holds [of\nthat something] (\u1e0dar\u016br\u012b\na\u1e0d-\u1e0dar\u016br\u012b \u1e0dar\u016br\u012b) and what\nholds of what holds [of something] holds of [that something]\n(maw\u011f\u016bd [for wu\u011f\u016bd] al-maw\u011f\u016bd\nmaw\u011f\u016bd).\n\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature of Avicenna\u2019s system is the\nproductivity (and foundational role) of first-figure syllogisms with a\npossibility minor premise, which has traditionally been regarded as\nproblematic by many of Avicenna\u2019s commentators.  The case in\nsupport of this view hinges primarily on a certain reading of the\nterms and the idea that possibility propositions express relations of\ncompatibility (or separability) among conceptions or essences, which\nAvicenna often spells out in terms of natures (of the subject and\npredicate) (Thom 2008, 2012).\n\nA noteworthy property of the second figure is that as a result of\nAvicenna\u2019s replacement of the Aristotelian assertoric with his\nown general absolute, there are, strictly speaking, no\nproductive moods out of two absolute premises, due to their failure to\nconvert as themselves (Street 2002). Avicenna, however, is committed\nto the productivity of the familiar four moods in the second figure\nwhen the absolute is taken in a qualified sense, according to which it\nconverts as itself, namely when it is at least as strong as\nan Ld1-proposition (the same\napplies to second-figure XM moods). Avicenna consistently discusses\nthis essential requirement in his logical works, often in conjunction\nwith the claim that this qualified reading is the default sense of the\ne-proposition as well as being the one adopted in the sciences\n(Strobino forthcoming).\n\nAn account of Avicenna\u2019s modal syllogistic influenced by\nconsiderations of this sort and aiming to look at its logical\nproperties in tandem with Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics has been\nrecently offered by (Thom 2012). The project is inspired by principles\nthat are similar to those underpinning the most significant recent\ndevelopments in the interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistic (Malink 2013). A model that stresses the two-dimensional\ncharacter of Avicenna\u2019s logic and reads Avicenna as reducing\nalethic modalities to temporal modalities only has been proposed by\n(Hodges and Johnston 2017).\n5.1.2 Hypothetical syllogistic\n\nThe hypothetical propositions discussed above may be used as premises\nand conclusions of syllogistic arguments.\nTypes of hypothetical syllogism\n\nAvicenna investigates five main types of hypothetical syllogisms (with\nfurther internal divisions). The first three are combinations of two\nconditional premises (type 1), a conditional premise and a disjunctive\npremise (type 2), or two disjunctive premises (type 3), and are called\npure (\u1e63irfa) hypothetical syllogisms. The last two are\ncombinations of a conditional and a categorical premise (type 4,\nsubdivided into two classes), or of a disjunctive and a categorical\npremise (type 5), and are called mixed\n(mu\u1e2btala\u1e6da) hypothetical\n syllogisms.[16]\n\nIn general, there are some structural features that need to be kept in\nmind, while looking at this part of Avicenna\u2019s logic.\nHypothetical syllogisms are connective (iqtir\u0101n\u012b) syllogisms\nand, as we have seen above, this means by definition that the premises\nare connected by a shared element. The latter may be either (i) a term\n(types 4 and 5, where the sharing occurs between a term in the\ncategorical premise and a term in one of the constituent propositions of the\nhypothetical (conditional or disjunctive) premise) or (ii) a proposition (types 1, 2,\nand 3). In certain cases, the arrangement is such that it is possible to identify\nthree figures in a way analogous to categorical\nsyllogisms, whether the shared part is a term (types 4 and 5 again) or\na proposition (type 1). In other cases, no such partition emerges,\nespecially in the absence of an intrinsic order of the parts (type 3).\n\nAnother standard feature of Avicenna\u2019s discussion, especially\nwhere premises are of different kinds (type 2, 4, and 5), is that\narguments are classified in function of (i) which premise is major and\nwhich is minor; (ii) what part is shared (for conditionals, whether it\nis part of the antecedent or of the consequent; for disjunctions, whether\nthe disjunction is real or unreal, and whether the shared part is\naffirmative or negative).\n\nOn several occasions\u2014most notably but not exclusively in the\ncontext of the abridged treatments\u2014Avicenna simplifies the\nanalysis and avoids a detailed discussion of individual productive\nmoods by providing general criteria for productivity, determined\naccording to these different parameters. Again, this approach is\nstructurally similar to the one adopted in the treatment of the categorical syllogistic but the complexity\nis higher due to additional variables at play with hypotheticals. It\nis worth noting that in Post-Avicennan logic, starting in particular\nwith \u1e2a\u016bna\u011f\u012b, considerable attention is paid to\nthis part of Avicenna\u2019s system, and the discovery of additional\nmoods as well as the rejection of moods accepted by Avicenna were\noften associated with a critique and revision of these criteria\n(El-Rouayheb 2010).\nType 1: hypothetical syllogisms with two conditional premises (Qiy\u0101s VI.1)\n\nIn hypothetical syllogisms with two conditional premises, the shared\npart is a proposition which plays the same role as the middle term in\ncategorical syllogisms. Depending on whether it is (i) the consequent\nof the major premise and the antecedent of the minor, (ii) the\nconsequent of both or (iii) the antecedent of both, arguments of this\nkind will fall into one of the three familiar figures. The moods in\neach figure are determined here in function of the quality and\nquantity of the conditional premises and conclusion, unlike in the\ncase of combinations involving a categorical and a conditional, where figures\nand moods, as we shall see below, are determined by the categorical\npremise and another categorical proposition, which is either the consequent or the\nantecedent of the other (conditional) premise.\n\nThe moods presented below are not unrestrictedly productive. In several\ncases their productivity depends on whether the conditional is\nimplicative (luz\u016bm\u012b) or coincidental\n(ittif\u0101q\u012b). I list moods that Avicenna regards to\nbe valid once the required qualifications are added, but for the sake\nof simplicity the latter are not expressed in the notation.\n\nThe first figure comprises the four characteristic moods, which are\ndescribed as perfect (k\u0101mil). Avicenna discusses at some\nlength the status of this figure with respect to whether the\nconditionals it expresses are luz\u016bm\u012b or\nittif\u0101q\u012b.\n\n\nFirst figure\n\n\nHyp.

For example, \n\n\nIf the negative [premise] is [the negation] of an implication, which is compatible with\n[mere] coincidence, and the affirmative [premise] affirms coincidence, then the syllogism will not be productive at\nall.

The proof of the\nproductive moods, in addition to the standard methods seen above,\noften involves turning a conditional premise into a disjunctive\npremise or vice versa (the analysis of these inferential relations occupies\nAvicenna in Qiy\u0101s VII.1\u20132, but he uses them freely\nthroughout Qiy\u0101s VI, before explicitly discussing them\nin the subsequent treatise). Similarly, after showing that a given\npremise pair yields a hypothetical conclusion of a certain kind,\nAvicenna often shows that it also yields a hypothetical conclusion of\nthe other kind, whether logically equivalent or simply implied by the\nformer.\n\nIn general, for this type of premises, the classification of arguments\nrests on the following criteria: which premise\u2014major or\nminor\u2014is conditional and which is disjunctive; whether the\nshared part (here always a\n proposition)\n is the antecedent or the consequent of the conditional;[18] whether the\ndisjunction is real or not; whether the parts of the disjunction are\naffirmative or negative; and whether the conditional is an implication\nor\n not.[19]\n\nAvicenna discusses various combinations\n(ta\u02bel\u012bf\u0101t) of syllogisms, identified first on the basis of their major and minor premises, and then differentiated according to the\nother parameters. Individual moods, in analogy with categoricals, are\nidentified in function of the quality and quantity of their\n(hypothetical) premises. The combinations are accordingly distributed\ninto two main groups. In the first group, syllogisms have a\ndisjunctive major and a conditional minor. In the second group,\nsyllogisms have a conditional major and a disjunctive minor.\n\n\nGroup 1 (disjunctive major, conditional\nminor)\n\n\nCase 1: the disjunction is real and the\nshared part is the consequent of the conditional\n\nCase 2: the disjunction is unreal and the\nshared part is the consequent of the conditional\n\nCase 3: the disjunction is real and the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional\n\nCase 4.1: the disjunction is unreal, the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional and is\naffirmative\n\nCase 4.2: the disjunction is unreal, the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional and is negative\n\n\nGroup 2 (conditional major, disjunctive\nminor)\n\n\nCase 5: the disjunction is real and the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional\n\nCase 6.1: the disjunction is unreal, the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional and is\naffirmative\n\nCase 6.2: the disjunction is unreal, the\nshared part is the antecedent of the conditional and is negative\n\nCase 7: the disjunction is real, the shared\npart is the consequent of the conditional\n\nCase 8: the disjunction is unreal, the\nshared part is the consequent of the conditional\n\n\n\nAn example of case 1, from the first group, is the following (Qiy\u0101s VI.2,\n305.8\u201310):\n\n\n\\[\n(\\aD^{1})rq; (\\aC)pr \\vdash (\\aC)p\\neg q\n\\]\n\n\n\nAlways, either C is D or A is B; Always, if H is Z, then C is D\n\u22a2 Always, if H is Z, then A is not B\n\n\n\nbut also (Na\u011f\u0101t 82, xix)\n\n\n\\[\n(\\aD^{1})rq; (\\aC)pr \\vdash \\aD^{1})pq\n\\]\n\n\n\nAlways, either C is D or A is B; Always, if H is Z, then C is D\n\u22a2 Always, either H is Z or A is B\n\n\n\nAvicenna\u2019s discussion, besides its intrinsic logical merits, is\nenriched by several examples (especially counterexamples put forward\nto show that certain moods are not productive) taken from the domains\nof physics and metaphysics.\nType 3: hypothetical syllogisms with two disjunctive premises (Qiy\u0101s VI.3)\n\nThe third type of hypothetical syllogisms is, by contrast, the simplest.\nIt involves premise pairs with two disjunctions. Avicenna notes that\nas a result of the status of real disjunctions, which are both exclusive\nand exhaustive, there can be no combination involving two such\npremises. The proof of this claim involves an interesting point about\nthe meaning of quantification in the case of disjunctions already\nraised at Qiy\u0101s V.5 (particular disjunctions express\nnon-exhaustive alternatives).\n\nFurthermore, this type is not arranged in figures because disjuncts\nare symmetrical (mutak\u0101fi\u02be), unlike the antecedent\nand the consequent of a conditional, which also implies that there is\nno distinction between major and minor premise (all permutations are\nequivalent, as they are not sensitive to order).\n\nThe combinations considered in this case all involve at least an\nunreal disjunction, which may be paired with a real disjunction, the\nnegation of a real disjunction or with another unreal disjunction,\nwhere the shared part may be affirmative or negative.\n\nThe first mood, where the two premises are both affirmative and one has a negative part, is as follows (Qiy\u0101s VI.3, 321.4\u20135)\n\n\\[\n(\\aD^{3})r\\neg q; (\\aD^{1})pr \\vdash (\\aD^{1/3})\\neg p\\neg q\n\\]\n\n\nThe proof is based on turning the two disjunctive premises into the\nconditional statements that logically follow from them, namely\n\\((\\aD^{3})r\\neg q \\vdash (\\aC)\\neg r\\neg q\\), and \\((\\aD^{1})pr\n\\vdash (\\aC)p\\neg r\\). From such conditional premises, one may easily derive the conditional conclusion \\((\\aC)p\\neg q\\), which in turn entails the disjunctive proposition \\((\\aD^{1/3})\\neg p\\neg q\\).\n\nAn example with affirmative universal unreal disjunctive premises sharing a negative part \nis as follows (Qiy\u0101s VI.3, 323.14\u2013324.5) \n\n\\[\n(\\aD^{3})\\neg rq; (\\aD^{3})p\\neg r \\vdash  (\\oD^{3})pq\n\\]\n\n\nwhich is equivalent to the following syllogism \n\n\\[\n(\\aC)rq; (\\aC)rp \\vdash (\\iC)pq\n\\]\n\n\nin virtue of inferential relations holding among disjunctions and\n conditionals.[20]\nType 4: hypothetical syllogisms with a conditional and a categorical premise (Qiy\u0101s VI.4\u20135)\n\nThe first three types are pure hypothetical syllogisms. The fourth and\nfifth are mixed hypothetical syllogisms consisting of a hypothetical\npremise combined with a categorical.\n\nThe hypothetical syllogism consisting of a conditional and a\ncategorical premise is the most prominent case in the extensive\ntreatment of the Qiy\u0101s. The analysis occupies two chapters whose sequential order seems to be all but accidental. The classification of arguments\nfollows familiar criteria but in this case the order of priority is\ndifferent. The first parameter depends on what the shared part is. There\nare two main types according to whether the connection between major\nand minor premise obtains in the consequent (Qiy\u0101s VI.4)\nor in the antecedent of the conditional premise (Qiy\u0101s\nVI.5). The second parameter depends on whether the major is\ncategorical or conditional.\n\nWhat is shared in this case is a term that connects the categorical\npremise with another categorical, namely the antecedent or the\nconsequent of the conditional premise. This entails that syllogisms of\nthis type are in fact arguments \u201ccontaining\u201d a categorical\nsyllogism whose conclusion is either implied by or implies another\nproposition. This is perhaps the reason why the main division is given\nin terms of whether the sharing occurs (i) in the consequent or (ii)\nin the antecedent, and also the reason why the former case is taken to\nbe more relevant (or at least more common) in the sciences. For in\ncase (i), all syllogisms will yield the conclusion of the\ncorresponding categorical syllogism subject to a condition, namely as\nthe consequent of a conditional statement; whereas in case (ii) the\ninteraction between the quantification of the conditional and the\nquantification of the antecedent yields moods that only partially overlap with\nthe standard set of categorical moods and that are subject to various\nqualifications.\n\nBoth kinds of considerations\u2014on the more natural character of\ncertain inference patterns and on their applicability to the sciences\n(Qiy\u0101s V.1, Na\u011f\u0101t\n82)\u2014indirectly confirm that the hypothetical syllogistic is an\nintegral part of Avicenna's theory and practice of philosophical and\nscientific discourse.\n\nLast, the two types of mixed hypothetical syllogisms are the only cases in which\nAvicenna systematically investigates quantified atomic propositions\n(an obvious consequence of the fact that he is looking at inferences\nwhich, in conditional form, very much resemble those analyzed in the\ncategorical syllogistic).\n\nIn Qiy\u0101s VI.4, which generally deals with the group of\nsyllogisms where the sharing occurs in the consequent of the\nconditional premise, Avicenna investigates two cases: the first with a\ncategorical major and a conditional minor, the second with a conditional\nmajor and a categorical minor. It is not hard to see how this approach naturally yields conditional versions of the familiar figures and moods, in function of the position of the shared term.\n\nIn each case and figure, Avicenna distinguishes the moods also\naccording to the kind of quantified conditionals involved in the conditional\npremise and in the conditional conclusion.\n\n\nCase 1: categorical major, conditional minor, sharing\nin the consequent of the conditional; in three figures\n(Qiy\u0101s VI.4, 325.2\u2013331.9)\n\nFirst figure: predicate of the consequent of the\nconditional = subject of the categorical major\n\nuniversal affirmative conditional premise\n\n\nHyp.

In both cases the\nmoods correspond to those of the relevant categorical figures, in each\ncase with four variations depending on the quality and quantity of the\nconditional major. The transformations are the same as above. Avicenna\noccasionally gives a summary of the conditions of productivity (for\nexample, in second-figure moods where the conditional premise is\na universal negative, the consequent must be particular and have the\nsame quality as the categorical premise) without ever analyzing the\ncase of particular conditional premises explicitly.\n\n\nLast, it is worth noting that Avicenna explicitly characterizes the\nhypothetical syllogisms with an affirmative conditional major, a\ncategorical minor and a shared term in the consequent of the\ncategorical, as those in which the condition of productivity is that\nthe categorical and the consequent of the conditional should be related in the same way as in the connections\n(iqtir\u0101n\u0101t) of first-figure categorical\nsyllogisms. In this case,\n\n\nthe conclusion is a conditional proposition whose consequent would be\nthe conclusion [produced] by the two categorical [propositions], were they to be taken in isolation [i.e., not as part of\na hypothetical syllogism]. (Qiy\u0101s VI.4, 331.13) \n\n\nFor similar reasons, the same applies to the previous case (the\ncombination of a categorical major and a conditional minor). In this connection,\nAvicenna notes that the only difference between categorical syllogisms\nand hypothetical syllogisms with such characteristics is that in the\nformer the conclusion \u201cfollows without qualification, while here [it\nfollows] if something is posited\u201d (Qiy\u0101s VI.4,\n325.14\u20135).\n\nThe second major division of hypothetical syllogisms consisting of a\nconditional and a categorical premise obtains when the sharing occurs in\nthe antecedent. The analysis of these syllogisms is the subject of\nQiy\u0101s VI.5, which is the only place in the corpus where\nthey are treated explicitly. Elsewhere (e.g., Na\u011f\u0101t\n82), hypothetical syllogisms of this kind are said to be less used in\nthe sciences. In spite of the structural analogy to the cases\ndiscussed above (the conclusion is still a conditional proposition,\neven though here the categorical \u201cfragment\u201d occupies the\nplace of the antecedent), the way the quantification of the\nconditional and the quantification of the antecedent interact generate\nresults that do not generally mirror categorical syllogisms. The\nclassification is parallel to the previous case and consists of two\nmain groups: the first with a conditional major and a categorical\nminor, the second with a categorical major and a conditional minor.\nEach group is divided into three figures, as above, and the moods of\neach figure are analyzed with respect the four combinations of quality\nand quantity of the conditional premise.\nType 5: hypothetical syllogisms with a disjunctive and a categorical premise (Qiy\u0101s VI.6)\n\nThe second kind of mixed hypothetical syllogisms consists of a\ndisjunctive and a categorical premise (or several categorical\npremises). It is at least briefly mentioned in all of Avicenna\u2019s\nlogical works and receives a more extensive treatment in\nQiy\u0101s VI.6, 349.1\u2013354.12. Like some of the types discussed above, this\nkind of hypothetical syllogism is indirectly acknowledged to have an\napplication outside the domain of formal logic, as Avicenna contends\nthat, with certain qualifications, it expresses a mode of reasoning\nsimilar to that involved in the method of induction\n(Qiy\u0101s VI.6, Burh\u0101n I.7). This obtains when a hypothetical syllogism of this type expresses a\ncomplete division, the predication is real\n(\u1e25aq\u012bq\u012b), and the subject is the subject of\nthe disjunctive proposition, in which case it is called \u201cdivided\nsyllogism\u201d (qiy\u0101s muqassam).\n\nAvicenna explores different possibilities in turn. With the help\nof the shorter treatment in the Na\u011f\u0101t, an\nunderlying structure may be identified, where the order is inverted\nwith respect to the way in which materials are arranged in the Qiy\u0101s. He distinguishes\nbetween two main groups of syllogisms, one (i) in which the\ncategorical premise is only one; the other (ii) in which multiple\ncategoricals are involved.\n\nIn the first case, the most natural arrangement is when the minor is\nan affirmative categorical and its predicate is the subject of the\ndisjunctive major. The example at Na\u011f\u0101t 82, xvi \u201cEverything countable is either even or\nodd; every large quantity is countable; therefore, every large\nquantity is either even or odd\u201d is in line with the general\nscheme \u201cAlways, every B is either H or Z; every C is B;\ntherefore, always, every C is either H or Z\u201d given at\nQiy\u0101s VI.6, 353.8\u20139. In the Na\u011f\u0101t Avicenna\nasserts that this arrangement comes in four combinations, and both in the\nQiy\u0101s and in the Na\u011f\u0101t he refers to the\nabove as (a mood of) the first figure. Admissible variants seem to be\nthose involving a particular major and minor, or a universal negative\nmajor (or affirmative with negative parts). The second figure is said\nto be non-productive (and is consistently not mentioned in the\nNa\u011f\u0101t), while the third figure is said to conclude\nby conversion but is not discussed any further.\n\nIn the second case, where the major is categorical and the minor\ndisjunctive, the major consists in fact of multiple categoricals, which must\nbe as many in number as the parts of the disjunction (to ensure a\nproper connection). Every categorical and every disjunct are connected\nby a term; and all the parts of the disjunction share a\n term.[24]\n This yields two basic sub-cases, each arranged in figures. A schema\nfrom the first figure associated with the notion of a complete\ninduction is \u201cEvery C and H and Z is A; every B is either C or H\nor Z; therefore every B is A\u201d. It is illustrated by the example \n\n\nEvery animal is a body and every plant is a body and every mineral is\na body; everything that moves is either an animal or a plant or a\nmineral; therefore everything that moves is a body.\n(Na\u011f\u0101t 82, xvii)\n\nSyllogisms of hypotheticals sharing an incomplete part (two disjunctions) (Qiy\u0101s VI.6, 354.13\u2013356.6)\n\nHypothetical syllogisms whose premises share an incomplete part\nare perhaps best understood in opposition to two types of purely\nhypothetical syllogisms discussed above, namely those consisting of a\npair of disjunctive premises and those consisting of a disjunctive and\na conditional premise. In both cases, the shared part was a whole\nproposition. Syllogisms involving hypotheticals that share an\nincomplete part are a variation on the latter, determined by the fact\nthat the shared element is a term instead of a whole proposition. They\nmay involve either (i) two disjunctive premises or (ii) a conditional\nand a disjunctive premise with one term in common (in the latter case,\nwith a conditional minor). An example is given at Na\u011f\u0101t\n82, xx.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s cursory treatment of this case may be at the origin\nof a much more elaborate development in the analysis of this class of hypothetical syllogisms in Post-Avicennan logic, starting with\nKa\u0161\u0161\u012b (El-Rouayheb 2010).\n5.2 Repetitive Syllogistic\n\nThe repetitive (isti\u1e6fn\u0101\u02be\u012b) syllogistic\ncovers inference patterns such as modus ponens and modus\ntollens (in their conditional and disjunctive variants). It\nconstitutes the other major division of the syllogistic along with the\nconnective (iqtir\u0101n\u012b) syllogistic and seems to be regarded by Avicenna as somehow\ndependent on it (a systematic\ndiscussion of the reducibility of the former to the latter occupies\npart of Qiy\u0101s IX.1, where Avicenna\ndiscusses among other things the idea that the major premise of modus\nponens may be in a sense redundant).\n\nRepetitive syllogisms consist of (i) a hypothetical premise\n(conditional or disjunctive) containing the conclusion or its negation as one of its\nparts, and (ii) another premise which asserts or denies\n(and thereby \u201crepeats\u201d) part of the hypothetical premise. Example of\nnotable argument forms of this kind are the following \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\np \\rightarrow q,    p  & \u22a2 q && (\\textit{modus ponens})\\\\\np \\rightarrow q,    \u00acq  & \u22a2 \u00acp && (\\textit{modus tollens})\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nwhere the hypothetical premise is a conditional (Avicenna also\nconsiders the case of bi-conditionals), and \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\np \\lor^{1} q, \\neg p  & \u22a2 q\\\\\np \\lor^{1} q, p          & \u22a2 \\neg q\\\\\np \\lor^{3} q, \\neg p  & \u22a2 q && (\\textrm{disjunctive syllogism})\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nwhere the hypothetical premise is a disjunction (either real or\nunreal).\n5.3 Reductio ad absurdum (qiy\u0101s al-\u1e2balf )\n\nAvicenna\u2019s account of reductio is an interesting case\nin which several of his technical distinctions come into play. A\nreductio is a compound syllogism (qiy\u0101s\nmurakkab)\u2014i.e., a concatenation of\nsyllogisms\u2014consisting of a connective hypothetical syllogism\nand of a repetitive syllogism. Both categorical and hypothetical\npropositions may be proved by reductio.\n\nAt Na\u011f\u0101t 91, i, Avicenna offers a straightforward example of a\nreductio proof of AaB in the categorical syllogism CaB; AaC\n\u22a2 AaB, where (1) is the connective hypothetical syllogism (with a conditional minor) and (2) the\nrepetitive syllogism (an instance of modus tollens):\n\nCaB; If \u00acAaB, then AoB \u22a2 if \u00ac AaB, then AoC\nIf \u00acAaB, then AoC; AaC \u22a2 AaB\n\n\nFirst syllogism (connective hypothetical of type 4, with a conditional minor)\n\n\n\ni.\nCaB\n (major premise of the initial syllogism = major premise of 1)\n\n\nii.\n If \u00ac AaB, then AoB \n(minor premise of 1, based on a/o contradiction)\n\n\niii.\nIf \u00ac AaB, then AoC \n(i, ii, Hyp. Baroco \\(\\textrm{Cat-}(\\textrm{a-}\\mathbb{C})\\textrm{-}(\\textrm{a-}\\mathbb{C})\\), Qiy\u0101s VI.4, 328).\n\n\n\nSecond syllogism (repetitive)\n\n\n\niv.\nIf \u00ac AaB, then AoC \n(conclusion of 1 = major premise of 2)\n\n\nv.\nAaC \n(minor premise of the initial syllogism = minor premise of 2)\n\n\nvi.\n AaB \n(iv, v, modus tollens) QED \n\n\n\n\nIn Qiy\u0101s VIII.3 Avicenna discusses a version of\nreductio in which the conclusion aimed at\n(ma\u1e6dl\u016bb) is a hypothetical (conditional)\nproposition:\n\nHypothetical case: (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))qr; (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pr \u22a2\n(o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pq\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))qr; If \u00ac(o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pq, then (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pq \n\u22a2 if \u00ac(o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pq, then (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pr\nIf \u00ac(o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pq, then (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pr; (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pr\n\u22a2 (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pq\n\n\nFor a recent analysis of the logical properties of reductio\nin Avicenna and its general significance see (Hodges 2017).\n6. Demonstration\n\nThe theory of demonstration represents for Avicenna not only an\nessential part of logic but its true culmination. Its central problems\nare the identification of (i) the conditions under which\ncertainty (yaq\u012bn) may be attained in making\nassertions within the context of a scientific discipline and the\nidentification of (ii) the conditions under which completeness,\nrelevance, and accuracy may be achieved in the process of concept\nformation that leads to definitions. This determines in turn the\nnature of the principles assumed in each science for the derivation of\nits own theorems, the way in which boundaries between disciplines\nare drawn, and more generally the overall architecture of scientific\nknowledge.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s original contributions in this area include: (1)\nre-casting the model of the Posterior Analytics in terms of\nthe two fundamental notions of conception and assertion (Strobino 2010\nand 2015b), associating them with (2) a more systematic, and\nultimately simplified, treatment of the four Aristotelian questions\n(if, that, what, why) (Strobino 2015b); (3) a peculiar understanding\nof the notion of necessity in light of Avicenna's own distinction between the\nreferential/substantial and the descriptional reading (Strobino\n2015a); (4) a sophisticated account of per se, linked with the\ntheory of the predicables (Strobino 2016b); (5) an elaborate model for the classification of the\nsciences (Strobino 2017); (6) an innovative classification of that-\nand why-demonstrations (Strobino forthcoming); and (7) a commitment to\nthe applicability of formal logic as a whole to scientific discourse,\nfor instance through the explicit acknowledgment of the fact that the principles\nand conclusions of demonstrative arguments may be both categorical and\nhypothetical propositions, and that categorical as well as\nhypothetical (and repetitive) syllogisms play a role in the\nsciences.\n\nIn this area, Avicenna\u2019s work reflects in complex ways the\ninfluence not only of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b but also of the Greek\ncommentary tradition, especially Themistius and Philoponus, whose\nexegetical work on the Posterior Analytics, now lost in\nArabic, was available to Avicenna. This becomes especially evident\nthrough implicit or explicit references to the commentators\n(mufassir\u016bn) and their commentaries (taf\u0101s\u012br,\n\u0161ur\u016b\u1e25) disseminated in his own Kit\u0101b\nal-Burh\u0101n (Eichner 2010, Strobino 2012, forthcoming).\n6.1. Conception and Assertion\n\nThe distinction between conception\n(ta\u1e63awwur) and assertion (ta\u1e63d\u012bq)\ncomes into play in several crucial ways in Avicenna\u2019s logic of\nscientific discourse.\n\nThe distinctive mark of demonstrative\narguments\u2014certainty\u2014is characterized in terms of assertion. An assertion p is certain if and only if  one holds (i) the\njustified belief that p and (ii) the justified belief that\np cannot be otherwise; a demonstrative argument is one in\nwhich certainty is transferred from premises to conclusion.\nDemonstrative assertions are explicitly identified by Avicenna in the\nframework of a broader classification of various types of assertions\nof decreasing epistemic strength (certain, endoxic, suppositional,\nfallacious), which are in turn associated with a canonical taxonomy of\nlogical disciplines (demonstration, dialectic, rhetoric, sophistic)\n(Gutas 2012; Hasnawi 2013; Black 1990).\n\nFurthermore, Avicenna\u2019s flavor of Aristotelian foundationalism,\ni.e., the view that in every science there are first principles on which everything else depends and which do not depend in\nturn on anything else, is expressed in terms of the need for (i)\nimmediate assertions (ta\u1e63d\u012bq\u0101t) that are not\ngrounded on further assertions and (ii) for the conceptions\n(ta\u1e63awwur\u0101t) of primitive notions.\n\nThe notion of conception is also crucial for Avicenna\u2019s theory\nof per se (\u1e0f\u0101t\u012b), where a basic distinction between types of scientific\npredicates depends on whether they are conceptually inseparable from\ntheir subjects or not (Strobino 2016b).\n6.2 Questions\n\nThe four Aristotelian questions\u2014if, that, what, and\nwhy\u2014discussed in Posterior Analytics B1\u20132 are\nsubject to a more systematic analysis in Avicenna\u2019s\nBurh\u0101n I.5 and IV.1. In Burh\u0101n I.5, in particular, they are rearranged in three pairs with\nseveral internal subdivisions: (i) what (m\u0101), with\nrespect to the meaning of the name or with respect to the essence;\n(ii) why (lim\u0101), with respect to unqualified existence or\nwith respect to existence in a given state; and (iii) if (hal)/that\n(anna), again with respect to unqualified existence or with respect to existence in\na given state. The notion of existence in a state in (ii) and (iii) encapsulates the case of attribute ascription in its causal and factual version, respectively. The three pairs of questions may apply to both subject\nand predicate of a scientific statement.\n\nAvicenna explores various relations and concludes that what- and\nif-questions, in some of their declensions, are more fundamental in\ncharacter, as why-questions ultimately reduce to questions about the\nessence of something, and if-questions express crucial necessary\nconditions for any science, namely the existence of basic entities in\nits domain and the assumption of certain fundamental predicative\nclaims about them.\n\nThe classification of questions is inspired by the idea of reducing them\nto the two basic paths of scientific knowledge: conception and\nassertion and their discursive counterparts, definition and syllogism\n(Strobino 2015b).\n6.3 Necessity\n\nOne of the single most important theoretical revisions of the\nAristotelian model concerns the notion of necessity (\u1e0dar\u016bra), which in fact\ntakes on a new role in Avicenna\u2019s system in a number of\ndifferent ways. At a general level, there is an epistemic notion\nassociated with the idea of certainty mentioned above; then there is a\ntechnical sense involved in Avicenna\u2019s reading of necessity\nstatements (which are unsurprisingly a major ingredient of scientific\ntheories); and finally there is a notion of necessity associated with\nscientific predication, which in a way is the most fundamental of\nall.\n\nTake \u201ctriangle\u201d as a subject of predication and consider\nthe following two sets of attributes: (i) \u201cbeing a\nplane figure enclosed by three straight lines\u201d or simply\n\u201cbeing a plane figure\u201d, and (ii) \u201chaving three\nangles\u201d or \u201chaving the sum of the internal angles equal to\ntwo right angles\u201d. All of these attributes are necessarily true of\n\u201ctriangle\u201d but, according to Avicenna, they are necessarily true of\ntheir subject in two quite different ways. The first two attributes,\n\u201cbeing a plane figure\u201d and \u201cbeing a plane figure\nenclosed by three straight lines\u201d are essential\nattributes of \u201ctriangle\u201d (the former is its genus, the latter is its\ndefinition); they are constitutive of it in a way that\nthe other attributes are not. Furthermore, \u201cbeing a figure\u201d is\nconceptually inseparable from \u201ctriangle\u201d and contained\nin its definition, in the sense that we cannot properly define\n\u201ctriangle\u201d, in its true nature, without appealing to that notion. By contrast\n\u201chaving the sum of the internal angles equal to two right angles\u201d\nis not at all required to define \u201ctriangle\u201d, even if it is necessarily\nimplied by it, and is in fact an attribute that we typically prove to\nhold of its subject. Essential attributes of the first kind are captured\nby definitions, and in general have an explanatory role with respect\nto attributes of the other kind. They explain the fact that attributes\nof the other kind hold of their subjects. In Aristotle\u2019s theory\nof science, these two types of attributes are usually designated by\nthe technical term \u201cper se\u201d.\n\nAvicenna also originally puts his own distinction between the\nreferential/substantial and descriptional reading to use in his theory\nof science. Each of the above two types of necessity (essential and\nnon-essential) can hold on either reading. In particular, the\ndescriptional reading, which Avicenna takes to be the default sense of\nnecessity in scientific discourse, allows us to study the properties\nof a given object qua object of a certain kind (a bronze\ntriangle qua triangle) and to make true, necessary\npredications about it as long as it is a triangle (but not as\nlong as it exists, as a bronze triangle could be re-cast into a\ndifferent shape and lose some of the properties that necessarily hold\nof it qua triangle) (Strobino 2015a).\n6.4 Per se, Inseparability, Containment, and Implication\n\nAvicenna\u2019s elaborate account of per se predication elevates the\nrole of a technical distinction internal to the Aristotelian model and\nassigns it a larger and more systematic theoretical relevance, where\nthree levels of discourse are linked in an original way: (i) the\ntheory of per se itself, (ii) a distinction between types of metaphysical\nnecessity of different strength, captured by the notion of\ncontainment (ta\u1e0dammun) and necessary implication (iltiz\u0101m), and (iii) a distinction between\ntypes of inseparability, which grounds the other two. All three levels\nexpress in different ways the dichotomy between essential and\nnon-essential necessity (Strobino 2016b, forthcoming).\n\n(i) The notion of a per se attribute is ultimately linked with the\nidea that in a scientific theory the admissible terms must be salient\nproperties of the objects under investigation. Avicenna argues that it\nis only through this regimented conceptual vocabulary that the two\ndefining conditions of scientific knowledge (necessity and explanatory\ncharacter) can be met by a theory. In doing so, he provides a\nsystematic account of per se which elaborates on Aristotle\u2019s\ncursory remarks in Posterior Analytics A4 and A22. The Aristotelian\nanalysis of per se is based on the relation of \u201cbeing part of the definition, i.e. of the essence, of something\u201d: a\nterm A is per se 1 with respect to another term B if and only if A is part of the\ndefinition of B while a term A is per se 2 with respect to another term B if and only if B\nis part of the definition of A.\n\nAvicenna connects the definition and classification of the two primary\ntypes of per se relation to the concepts of constituent\n(muqawwim)\u2014the counterpart of per se 1\u2014and\nimplicate (l\u0101zim)\u2014the counterpart of per se\n2\u2014two characteristic notions of his system associated with\ndifferent kinds of metaphysical necessity.\n\n(ii) These different kinds of metaphysical necessity are the\ncounterparts of two types of entailment which Avicenna calls\ncontainment and necessary implication and which express necessary\nconnections of different strength between terms. Containment is the\nrelation between a notion and its intensional parts (i.e., the\nconstituents of its definition, which are ontologically part of its\nessence). Necessary implication is a weaker form of necessity holding\nbetween two notions that are merely inseparable.\n\n(iii) The above pairs (per se 1 and 2, and containment and necessary\nimplication) are associated with a further distinction between two\ntypes of inseparability. The theme is developed by Avicenna especially in connection with the Isagoge, most notably in Mad\u1e2bal I.5, I.6, and I.8. The first type is conceptual inseparability (the\ncounterpart of per se 1 and containment); the second type is\ninseparability in imagination (the counterpart of per se 2 and\nnecessary implication) (Strobino 2016b).\n\nAnother interesting feature of Avicenna\u2019s account of per se is\nthe attempt to develop systematically the Aristotelian criteria and to\nidentify the sets of per se predicates relevant for a given kind or\ndomain of scientific discourse. This has a significant impact on his\ntaxonomy of the interrelations among the sciences.\n6.5 Division of the Sciences\n\nAvicenna\u2019s classification (or division) of the sciences is a\nnatural complement to his treatment of per se as well as being one of the\nmost innovative attempts to develop systematically the material on the subordination of scientific disciplines in Posterior Analytics A7, A9,\nand A13. It is also important for an historical reason.\nAvicenna\u2019s account of the division of the sciences is in fact\nthe only part of his Burh\u0101n that actually had a direct\nimpact on the Western Latin tradition.\n\nThe source of Avicenna\u2019s classification is a chapter from his\nBurh\u0101n famously translated and encapsulated by the\ntwelfth-century Toledan philosopher and translator Dominicus\nGundissalinus (ca. 1110\u20131190) in his De divisione philosophiae. In the first\npart, Avicenna presents a basic classification of the types of\nhierarchical relations holding between various pairs of sciences, based on the corresponding\nrelations holding between their underlying subjects. At the root of the division\nis a distinction between sciences that differ because (a) they have\ntwo distinct subjects or (b) because they treat one and the same\nsubject in different ways. He articulates in full the\nprimary divisions of scientific domains, offering an analysis and\ncategorization of basic types of relations and dependencies (most notably, parthood\nand subordination). In the second part, Avicenna develops a complementary classification\nof the criteria of identity and distinctness for the sciences focusing\non the ways in which sciences may have elements in common. In this context, he addresses\nthe question from a different perspective\u2014that of the canonical\nthree elements of an Aristotelian science\u2014including not only the\nsubjects, but also scientific principles and questions (mas\u0101\u02beil), i.e., the\nconclusions of scientific syllogisms (the theorems of a science).\n\nThe use of three fundamental criteria\u2014subject/genus\n(maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf/\u011fins), principles\n(mab\u0101di\u02be), and per se attributes\n(\u02bfaw\u0101ri\u1e0d \u1e0f\u0101tiyya)\u2014to\ndetermine identity, overlap, or distinctness between domains of\nscientific inquiry is in line with Aristotelian orthodoxy. But\nAvicenna takes the criteria to a whole different level and articulates\na complex network of relations of superordination and subordination\nwhereby scientific knowledge is rigidly organized in hierarchical\nstructures that reflect underlying ontological relations between their\nobjects and attributes. For a detailed account see (Hugonnard-Roche 1988) and (Strobino 2017).\n6.6 Why- and That-Demonstration\n\nAvicenna\u2019s re-interpretation of the distinction between a\ndemonstration that something is the case and a demonstration why\nsomething is the case is related (i) to the classification of per se,\ni.e., to the types of predicates used in demonstrative arguments,\nand (ii) to the division of the sciences (Strobino forthcoming).\n\nAvicenna distinguishes between two main types of demonstration in function of the types of predicates involved (in first-figure\ncategorical syllogisms): (a) those in which the middle term expresses\na per se 2 attribute of the minor, in which case the major may be\neither (aa) a per se 2 attribute of the middle or (ab) a per se 1\nattribute of the middle; and (b) those in which the middle term\nexpresses a per se 1 attribute of the minor, in which case the major is\nin most cases (ba) a per se 2 attribute of the middle, and only in two exceptional cases (bb) a per se 1 attribute of the middle (the reason is that\nusually demonstrations do not aim to prove that per se 1 attributes\nhold of their subjects, these relations being self-evident and captured by\ndefinitions).\n\nWhile proving an assertion, a demonstration may merely provide\nan inferential justification of it or, in addition to that, also the terms that causally explain why things are the way they are. All demonstrations of the\nfirst kind are that-demonstrations; all demonstrations of the second\nkind are why-demonstrations.\n\nWhy-demonstrations may express why (i) a certain attribute holds of a\nsubject or (ii) both why it holds of that subject and why it exists.\nIn this connection, Avicenna aims to draw a distinction between two different kinds of\nexplanation. The fact that the attribute of having the sum of the internal angles\nequal to two right angles holds of isosceles triangles because they\nare triangles is an example of the first kind: the attribute is true of\nsomething in virtue of its being true of a per se 1 attribute (in this case its genus) of that thing. The fact that vines are deciduous because they are wide-leaved\nis an example of the second kind. The distinction is parallel to a\ndistinction proposed for Aristotle between application arguments and\nsubject-attribute demonstrations (McKirahan 1992). Avicenna\u2019s\naccount of per se fits neatly into this scheme, where case (aa)\ncorresponds to why-demonstration of type (ii), and case (ba)\ncorresponds to why-demonstrations of type (i) (Strobino\nforthcoming).\n\nThat-demonstrations are also divided into two types, depending on\nwhether the context is one in which there is (iii) a causal relation\nbetween subject and predicate or (iv) not. Case (iii) is the most\ncommon type of that-demonstration, which typically obtains when the\nmiddle term (in the first figure) is the effect of the existence of\nthe major instead of being its cause (the opposite of type-(ii)\nwhy-demonstration). Case (iv) is a peculiar kind of that-demonstration which Avicenna\nincludes to account for immediate predications where an attribute\ndirectly follows, without mediation, from something\u2019s essence,\nwhich is the only case in which a that-demonstration may be associated\nwith certainty; or for cases where two attributes that are both\neffects of a cause are used to prove one another of a subject\n(Strobino 2016a, forthcoming).\n6.7 Logical Forms of Premises and Conclusions\n\nA point that Avicenna borrows from al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (Strobino\n2017) is the acknowledgment of the fact that the logical forms of scientific\nstatements (whether premises or conclusions) include both categorical\nand hypothetical propositions and that demonstrative arguments may be\nboth categorical and hypothetical (or even repetitive) syllogisms.\nWhat may look like a minor technical point has in fact significant\nimplications for a better understanding of some of Avicenna\u2019s\nmotives in developing his formal logic.\n6.8 Formal Logic and the Logic of Scientific Discourse\n\nAvicenna is open about the fact that the project undertaken in\nthe investigation of formal aspects of logic goes beyond its application in\nthe sciences (Qiy\u0101s\n IV.1).[25]\n\nAt the same time he is also open about the fact that the formal apparatus\ndeveloped in the syllogistic is not exclusively analyzed for the sake\nof studying its properties as a logical system. In fact, on multiple\noccasions Avicenna tells us that the various tools developed for\ninstance in the Qiy\u0101s are used in the sciences, or offers\nremarks on theoretical questions by specifying the default\ninterpretation in the context of scientific reasoning. This is the case (just to mention a few significant examples) in\nthe discussion of reductio ad absurdum and conditionals with\nimpossible antecedents and consequents (Qiy\u0101s\nV.4\u20135); in his account of descriptional necessity as the\ncanonical reading of necessity propositions (Burh\u0101n\nII.1, Qiy\u0101s II.2, Na\u011f\u0101t 123); in\nthe acknowledgment that premises and conclusions of scientific syllogisms may\nbe categorical as well as hypothetical propositions\n(Qiy\u0101s V.1, Burh\u0101n II.6); when he contends\nthat certain hypothetical syllogisms are less used in the sciences\n(Na\u011f\u0101t 82); when he draws connections between the\ntwo areas (Qiy\u0101s VI.5, Burh\u0101n I.7:\ninduction and qiy\u0101s muqassam; Burh\u0101n IV.1:\nif-question and conditional reasoning); or in maintaining the conditional character\nof certain principles in the particular sciences (Burh\u0101n II.7)\n(Strobino 2017).\n\nWhile the formal development of logic undeniably acquires for Avicenna\nan autonomous status that invites its own independent theoretical\nquestions, to see it as an entirely separate enterprise, detached from\napplication in the context of scientific discourse, would betray a\nmisconception of his intentions as well as of his practice.\n7. Fallacies\n\nThe treatment of fallacies addresses one of the complementary\nconditions expressed by the definition of logic, which is supposed to\ndeal not only with what is required in order to infer correctly what\nis unknown from what is known, but also with what is required to avoid\nerror in the case of inferences that appear legitimate without being\nso. There is a parallel in the case of conception and definition:\nlogic provides rules to identify and construct definitions and at the\nsame time instructions on how to avoid common errors in the process.\nAvicenna\u2019s analysis of fallacious reasoning attempts to combine\n(or perhaps force) Aristotle\u2019s treatment from the\nSophistical Refutations into a broader scheme driven by more\nsystematic concerns, which even in the extensive treatment of the\nCure is rather compact. The analysis of error in defining is\nusually covered in connection with the Posterior Analytics and\nthe Topics (for instance at Burh\u0101n IV,\n\u011eadal, IV, Na\u011f\u0101t 149). I will focus\nhere only on the former.\n\nThe Na\u011f\u0101t treatment perfectly captures this complex\nstrategy. It starts with a canonical distinction between fallacies as\n(i) dependent on expression (laf\u1e93) or (ii) dependent on\nmeaning (ma\u02bfn\u0101)\u2014the familiar distinction\nbetween de dictione and extra dictionem\n(language-dependent and language-independent) fallacies\u2014and\npairs it with the claim that fallacies are also either dependent on\n(iii) the form or on (iv) the matter of an argument, an aspect that is\npresent also in the cursory classification given in the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t (Street forthcoming).\n\nThe analysis continues with an attempt to \u201cdeduct\u201d the\nfallacies based on the idea that when a false conclusion is reached,\nthen at least one of the characteristic conditions of syllogistic\nreasoning must not have been met. It then proceeds to articulate a\ndetailed account of the different ways in which failure to meet those\nconditions corresponds to different items in Aristotle\u2019s famous\nlist of thirteen fallacies, which Avicenna occasionally groups or divides in\nslightly different ways, especially in the case of those that are dependent\non expression.\n\nThe discussion ends with a recapitulation that yields something very\nclose to Aristotle\u2019s list, even though in a few cases it is hard\nto pinpoint where exactly certain items belong in the systematic\nanalysis.\n\nThe primary reasons of error may be abstracted from a strong\ncharacterization of a syllogism. If a syllogistic argument is (a)\narranged according to one of the figures and its mood is productive,\n(b) it has primary distinct parts (terms) and secondary distinct parts\n(premises), (c) its premises are true, (d) distinct from and (e)\nbetter known than the conclusion, then a true conclusion must follow.\nOtherwise, at least one of conditions (a)\u2013(e) has not been\nmet.\n\nAvicenna unequivocally identifies two of the fallacies that are not\ndependent on expression with (d) and (e), namely petitio\nprincipii (mu\u1e63\u0101dara \u02bfal\u0101\nl-ma\u1e6dl\u016bb al-awwal) and positing what is not a cause as\na cause (a\u1e2b\u1e0f or wa\u1e0d\u02bf m\u0101 laysa\nbi-\u02bfilla \u02bfillatan). The latter is identified with\ncircular proof (bay\u0101n ad-dawr), which is consistent with\nthe doctrine of Qiy\u0101s IX.4 and Burh\u0101n\nII.1.\n\nThe fallacy of consequent (\u012bh\u0101m \u02bfaks\nal-law\u0101zim or \u012bh\u0101m al-\u02bfaks) can be\ntraced back to a subdivision of (c).\n\nThe fallacy of combining many questions (\u011fam\u02bf\nal-mas\u0101\u02beil) is listed in the Na\u011f\u0101t without being discussed and it is altogether absent from the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t. In Safsa\u1e6da I.3,\nhowever, Avicenna seems to treat this case, too, as a subdivision of (c).\n\nTwo other canonical fallacies of type (ii), namely the fallacy of\naccident (m\u0101 bi-l-\u02bfara\u1e0d) and secundum\nquid (s\u016b\u02be i\u02bftib\u0101r al-\u1e25aml or\ni\u0121f\u0101l taw\u0101bi\u02bf al-\u1e25aml) are listed\nat the end of the Na\u011f\u0101t section without being discussed, although\nthey, too, may presumably be classified as subdivisions of (c), namely\nerrors based on taking a premise to be true which merely appears to be\ntrue.\n\nThe case of ignoratio elenchi is more problematic. The last\navailable slot in the Na\u011f\u0101t list is called\n\u201csterility of the connection\u201d (\u02bfaqm\nal-qar\u012bna) and is seemingly not discussed in the preceding\nanalysis. A possibility is to associate it with case (a), namely with\nthe error resulting from failing to recognize an argument as invalid,\nwhich would however distort the original Aristotelian meaning. It may\nbe that Avicenna fails (or refuses) to recognize ignoratio\nelenchi in Aristotle\u2019s sense and perhaps turns into\nsomething like the error resulting from a lack of awareness of the form of\nthe syllogism, which leads to accept an invalid argument as valid.\nThis would be consistent with the I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t\nvocabulary, which introduces the \u201cignorance of the\ncomposition\u201d (\u01e7ahl at-ta\u02bfl\u012bf) as a\nfallacy while at the same time failing to mention ignoratio\nelenchi.\n\nIn the Na\u011f\u0101t, fallacies dependent on expressions\nseem to be variously associated with cases (a)\u2013(c). Avicenna\ndivides this category into two main sub-cases involving (i) a\nsimple expression (laf\u1e93 mufrad) or (ii) a compound\nexpression (laf\u1e93 murakkab).\n\nIn case (i), error may result from the association of multiple\nmeanings with an expression either in its core form\n(\u011fawhar) or in a derivative form (hay\u02bea).\nThe first case is proper equivocation (i\u0161tir\u0101k\nal-ism) (even though Avicenna uses the term also to refer\ngenerically to other types of language-dependent fallacies) and is in\nfact divided into a number of different sub-types (laf\u1e93\nmu\u0161tarak, mu\u0161akkak, muta\u0161\u0101bih, laf\u1e93\nmanq\u016bl, musta\u02bf\u0101r, ma\u011f\u0101z). The second\ncase is where Avicenna puts the counterpart of the fallacies of accent\nand form of expression (or inflection).\n\nCase (ii) includes the canonical fallacies of composition\n(tark\u012bb al-laf\u1e93) and division\n(taf\u1e63\u012bl al-laf\u1e93).\n\nThe case of amphiboly (judging from the examples) seems to be treated\nas an independent type, associated with (b), but its omission in the\nfinal Na\u011f\u0101t list may suggest that Avicenna, in line with what he does in the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t, possibly regards it as a sub-type of\nequivocation.\n\nThe treatment of fallacies is complemented by a parallel\nclassification of fallacious assertions (propositions that are deemed\nto be true because of a systematic error in their evaluation)\nconsistently discussed throughout Avicenna\u2019s logical works\n(e.g., Burh\u0101n I.4, I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t\nI.6).\nAbbreviations\n\nI use standard abbreviations for quantified categorical propositions:\na-, e-, i-, and o-propositions (universal affirmative, universal\nnegative, particular affirmative, and particular negative).\n\n\nAaB\n \u201cEvery A is B\u201d\n (kull A B)\n\nAeB\n \u201cNo A is B\u201d\n (l\u0101 \u0161ay\u02be min A B)\n\nAiB\n \u201cSome A is B\u201d\n (ba\u02bf\u1e0d A B)\n\nAoB \n\u201cNot every A is B\u201d \n(laysa kull A B)\n\n\nIn the case of modalized categoricals, the modality is prefixed (for\nthe one-sided absolute proposition, I omit the identifier X1\nunless required to avoid ambiguity).\nA full list of abbreviations is given below. For example, Ld1-AaB\nstands for \u201cEvery A is\nnecessarily B as long as it is A\u201d, M1-AiB\nfor \u201cSome A is possibly\nB\u201d, and A-AeB for \u201cNo A is ever\nB\u201d.\n\nIn the case of hypotheticals, I indicate first between parentheses\nquantification and type (conditional or disjunctive), followed by an\nindication of the quality and quantity of the parts (or, when the latter is not required, by simple propositional variables); in some cases the syntactic structure of an embedded categorical is made explicit in the above canonical form. Below are a few examples of expressions frequently used in this entry:\n\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa\n \u201cAlways, if every A is B, then every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ia\n \u201cNever, if some A is B, then every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(i-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))oe\n \u201cSometimes, if not every A is B, then no C is\nD\u201d\n\n(o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ee\n \u201cNot always, if no A is B, then no C is\nD\u201d\n\n\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))aa\n \u201cAlways, either every A is B or every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(e-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))ia \n\u201cNever, either some A is B or every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(i-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))oe\n \u201cSometimes, either not every A is B or no C is\nD\u201d\n\n(o-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))ee \n\u201cNot always, either no A is B or no C is\nD\u201d\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pq\n \u201cAlways, if p, then q\u201d\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))p-AaB\n \u201cAlways, if p, then every A is B\u201d\n\n\nOccasionally, a more fine-grained distinction between types of\nconditionals (luz\u016bm\u012b or ittif\u0101q\u012b) or types of disjunctions (exclusive and\nexhaustive; exclusive but non-exhaustive; inclusive) is required.\nSimilarly, it is sometimes necessary to identify antecedents and\nconsequents of conditionals (for conversion and inferential relations\nwith disjunctions). In such cases the above abbreviations are expanded\nto include the required additional information. For instance to\nexpress the claim that a universal affirmative exclusive and\nexhaustive disjunction implies a universal affirmative\nluz\u016bm\u012b conditional in which antecedent and\nconsequent are contradictories and may be any of the parts of the\ndisjunctive, I will write that\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)1)a1a2 implies\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)a1o2,\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)a2o1,\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)o1a2, and\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)o2a1, where superscript\n\u201cl\u201d stands for luz\u016bm\u012b, and the\nsuperscript numbers are used to track the disjuncts where they appear\nas antecedent or consequent of the conditional statements.\n",
