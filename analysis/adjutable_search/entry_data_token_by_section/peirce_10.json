    "main_text": "Semeiotic and Logic\n11. Semeiotic and Logic\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s settled opinion was that logic in the broadest sense is to be\nequated with semeiotic (the general theory of signs), and that logic\nin a much narrower sense (which he typically called \u201clogical\ncritic\u201d) is one of three major divisions or parts of\nsemeiotic. Thus, in his later writings, he divided semeiotic into\nspeculative grammar, logical critic, and speculative rhetoric (also\ncalled \u201cmethodeutic\u201d). Peirce\u2019s word\n\u201cspeculative\u201d is his Latinate version of the Greek-derived\nword \u201ctheoretical,\u201d and should be understood to mean\nexactly what the word \u201ctheoretical\u201d means.  Peirce\u2019s\ntripartite division of semeiotic is not to be confused with Charles\nW. Morris\u2019s division: syntax, semantics, and pragmatics (although\nthere may be some commonalities in the two trichotomies).\n\n\nBy speculative grammar Peirce understood the analysis of the kinds of\nsigns there are and the ways that they can be combined\nsignificantly. For example, under this heading he introduced three\ntrichotomies of signs and argued for the real possibility of only\ncertain kinds of signs. Signs are qualisigns, sinsigns, or legisigns,\naccordingly as they are mere qualities, individual events and states,\nor habits (or laws), respectively. Signs are icons, indices (also\ncalled \u201csemes\u201d), or symbols (sometimes called\n\u201ctokens\u201d), accordingly as they derive their significance\nfrom resemblance to their objects, a real relation (for example, of\ncausation) with their objects, or are connected only by convention to\ntheir objects, respectively. Signs are rhematic signs (also called\n\u201csumisigns\u201d and \u201crhemes\u201d), dicisigns (also\ncalled \u201cquasi-propositions\u201d), or arguments (also called\n\u201csuadisigns\u201d), accordingly as they are\npredicational/relational in character, propositional in character, or\nargumentative in character. Because the three trichotomies are\nindependent of each other, together they yield the abstract possibility\nthat there are 27 distinct kinds of signs.  Peirce argued, however,\nthat 17 of these are logically impossible, so that finally only 10\nkinds of signs are genuinely possible. In terms of these 10 kinds of\nsigns, Peirce endeavored to construct a theory of all possible natural\nand conventional signs, whether simple or complex.\n\n\nWhat Peirce meant by \u201clogical critic\u201d is pretty much logic\nin the ordinary, accepted sense of \u201clogic\u201d from\nAristotle\u2019s logic to present-day mathematical logic. As might be\nexpected, a crucial concern of logical critic is to characterize the\ndifference between correct and incorrect reasoning. Peirce achieved\nextraordinarily extensive and deep results in this area, and a few of\nhis accomplishments in this area will be discussed below.\n\n\nBy \u201cspeculative rhetoric\u201d or \u201cmethodeutic\u201d\nPeirce understood all inquiry into the principles of the effective use\nof signs for producing valuable courses of research and giving\nvaluable expositions.  Methodeutic studies the methods that\nresearchers should use in investigating, giving expositions of, and\ncreating applications of the truth. Peirce also understood, under the\nheading of speculative rhetoric, the analysis of communicational\ninteractions and strategies, and their bearing on the evaluation of\ninferences. Peirce\u2019s important topic of the economy of research is\nclosely affiliated with his idea of speculative rhetoric.  The idea of\nmethodeutic may overlap to some small extent with Morris\u2019s notion of\n\u201cpragmatics,\u201d but the spirit of Peirce\u2019s notion is much\nmore extensive than that of Morris\u2019s notion.  Moreover, Peirce handled\nthe notion of indexical reference under the heading of speculative\ngrammar and not under the heading of speculative rhetoric, whereas the\ntopic certainly belongs to Morris\u2019s pragmatics. There clearly exist connections \nbetween Peirce\u2019s speculative rhetoric, on the one hand, and the attention paid \nby twentieth-century philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and J. L. Austin \nto matters having to do with language as a set of various social practices. \nUnfortunately, however, little attention has been paid by Peirce scholars \nto the relations between Peirce\u2019s thinking and familiar twentieth-century \nnotions such as Wittgenstein\u2019s language-games and Austin\u2019s speech-acts.\n\n\nSpeculative rhetoric, however, has attracted considerable\nphilosophical attention in recent years, especially among Finnish\nPeirce scholars centering about the University of Helsinki. These have\nnoted that there are extensive affiliations between Peirce\u2019s\ndiscussions of the communicational and dialogical aspects of\nsemeiotic, on the one hand, and the many and varied\n\u201cgame-theoretical\u201d approaches to logic that have been for\nsome time of interest to Finnish philosophers (as well as many\nothers), on the other hand. Various proposals for game-theoretic\nsemantical approaches to logic have been developed and applied to\nPeirce\u2019s logic, as well as being used to understand Peircean\npoints.\n",
