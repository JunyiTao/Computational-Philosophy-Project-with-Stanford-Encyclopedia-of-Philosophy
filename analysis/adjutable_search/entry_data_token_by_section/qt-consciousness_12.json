    "main_text": "Mind and Matter as Dual Aspects || Further Developments\n5.3 Further Developments\n\nIn the Pauli-Jung conjecture, these correlations are called\nsynchronistic and have been extended to psychosomatic\nrelations (Meier 1975). A comprehensive typology of mind-matter\ncorrelations following from Pauli\u2019s and Jung\u2019s dual-aspect\nmonism was proposed by Atmanspacher and Fach (2013). They found that a\nlarge body of empirical material concerning more than 2000 cases of\nso-called \u201cexceptional experiences\u201d can be classified\naccording to their deviation from the conventional reality model of a\nsubject and from the conventional relations between its components\n(see Atmanspacher and Fach 2019 for more details). Synchronistic\nevents in the sense of Pauli and Jung appear as a special case of such\nrelational deviations. \n\nAn essential condition required for synchronistic correlations is that\nthey are meaningful for those who experience them. It is\ntempting to interpret the use of meaning as an attempt to introduce\nsemantic information as an alternative to syntactic information as\naddressed above. (Note the parallel to active information as in the\napproach by Bohm and Hiley.) Although this entails difficult problems\nconcerning a clear-cut definition and operationalization, something\nakin to meaning, both explicitly and implicitly, might be a relevant\ninformational currency for mind-matter relations within the framework\nof decompositional dual-aspect thinking (Atmanspacher 2014).\n\nPrimas (2003, 2009, 2017) proposed a dual-aspect approach where the\ndistinction of mental and material domains originates from the\ndistinction between two different modes of time: tensed (mental) time,\nincluding nowness, on the one hand and tenseless (physical) time,\nviewed as an external parameter, on the other (see the entries on\n time\n and on\n being and becoming in modern physics).\n Regarding these two concepts of time as implied by a symmetry\nbreaking of a timeless level of reality that is psychophysically\nneutral, Primas conceives the tensed time of the mental domain as\nquantum-correlated with the parameter time of physics via\n\u201ctime-entanglement\u201d. This scenario has been formulated in\na Hilbert space framework with appropriate time operators (Primas\n2009, 2017), so it offers a formally elaborated dual-aspect quantum\nframework for basic aspects of the mind-matter problem. It shows some\nconvergemce with the idea of temporally nonlocal mental states as\naddresed in\n Section 4.2.\n\nAs indicated in\n Section 3.2,\n the approach by Stapp contains elements of dual-aspect thinking as\nwell, although this is not much emphasized by its author. The\ndual-aspect quantum approaches discussed in the present section tend\nto focus on the issue of a generalized mind-matter\n\u201centanglement\u201d more than on state reduction. The primary\npurpose here is to understand correlations between mental and material\ndomains rather than direct causally efficacious interactions between\nthem.\n\nA final issue of dual-aspect approaches in general refers to the\nproblem of panpsychism or panexperientialism, respectively (see the\nreview by Skrbina 2003, and the entry on\n panpsychism).\n In the limit of a universal symmetry breaking at the\npsychophysically neutral level, every system has both a\nmental and a material aspect. In such a situation it is important to\nunderstand \u201cmentality\u201d much more generally than\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d. Unconscious or proto-mental acts as\nopposed to conscious mental acts are notions sometimes used to\nunderline this difference. The special case of human consciousness\nwithin the mental domain might be regarded as special as its material\ncorrelate, the brain, within the material domain.\n",
