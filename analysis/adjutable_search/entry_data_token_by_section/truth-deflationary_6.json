    "main_text": "The Varieties of Contemporary Deflationism || Disquotationalism\n3.2 Disquotationalism\n\nLike minimalism, disquotationalism agrees with inflationary accounts\nof truth that the alethic locutions function as predicates, at least\nlogically speaking. However, as we explained in discussing\nQuine\u2019s view in Section 2, disquotationalism diverges from\ninflationary views (and minimalism) at their shared assumption that\nthese (alethic) predicates serve to describe the entities\npicked out by the expressions with which they are combined,\nspecifically as having or lacking a certain property.\n\nAlthough Quine\u2019s disquotationalism is inspired by Tarski\u2019s\nrecursive method for defining a truth predicate, that method is not\nwhat Quine\u2019s view emphasizes. Field\u2019s contemporary\ndisquotationism further departs from that aspect of Tarski\u2019s\nwork by looking directly to the instances of the (T)-schema that the\nrecursive method must generate in order to satisfy Tarski\u2019s\ncriterion of material adequacy. Tarski himself (1944, 344\u20135)\nsuggests at one point that each instance of (T) could be considered a\n\u201cpartial definition\u201d of truth and considers (but\nultimately rejects; see Section 4.5) the thesis that a logical\nconjunction of all of these partial definitions amounts to a general\ndefinition of truth (for the language that the sentences belonged to).\nGeneralizing slightly from Tarski, we can call this alternative\napproach \u201c(T)-schema disquotationalism\u201d, in contrast with\nthe Tarski-inspired approach that David (1994, 110\u20131) calls\n\u201crecursive disquotationalism\u201d. Field (1987, 1994a)\ndevelops a version of (T)-schema disquotationalism that he calls\n\u201cpure disquotational truth\u201d, focusing specifically on the\ninstances of his preferred version of (ES), the \u201cdisquotational\nschema\u201d (Field 1994a, 258),\n\n(T[/ES-sent])\n\u201c\\(p\\)\u201d is true if and only if \\(p\\).\n\n\nSimilar to the \u201csingle principle\u201d formulation, (GT),\nrejected by Horwich (but endorsed by Hill), Field (ibid., 267) allows\nthat one could take a \u201cgeneralized\u201d version of\n(T/ES-sent), prefixed with a universal substitutional quantifier,\n\u2018\\(\\Pi\\)\u2019, as having axiomatic status, or one could\nincorporate schematic sentence variables directly into one\u2019s\ntheorizing language and reason directly with (T/ES-sent) as a schema\n(cf. ibid., 259). Either way, in setting out his version of\ndeflationism, Field (ibid., 250), in contrast with Horwich, does not\ntake the instances of his version of (ES) as fundamental but instead\nas following from the functioning of the truth predicate. On\nField\u2019s reading of (T/ES-sent), the use of the truth predicate\non the left-hand side of an instance does not add any cognitive\ncontent beyond that which the mentioned utterance has (for the\nspeaker) on its own when used (as on the right-hand-side of\n(T/ES-sent)). As a result, each instance of (T/ES-sent) \u201cholds\nof conceptual necessity, that is, by virtue of the cognitive\nequivalence of the left and right hand sides\u201d (ibid., 258). This\nplaces Field\u2019s deflationism also in position \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) in\nthe chart from Section 1.1.\n\nFollowing Leeds and Quine, Field (1999, 533\u20134) sees the central\nutility of a purely disquotational truth predicate to be providing for\nthe expression of certain \u201cfertile generalizations\u201d that\ncannot be made without using the truth predicate but which do not\nreally involve the notion of truth. Field (1994a, 264) notes that the\ntruth predicate plays \u201can important logical role: it allows us\nto formulate certain infinite conjunctions and disjunctions that\ncan\u2019t be formulated otherwise [n. 17: at least in a language\nthat does not contain substitutional quantifiers]\u201d.\n\nField\u2019s disquotationalism addresses some of the worries that\narose for earlier versions of this variety of deflationism, due to\ntheir connections with Tarski\u2019s method of defining truth\npredicates. It also explains how to apply a disquotational truth\npredicate to ambiguous and indexical utterances, thereby going beyond\nQuine\u2019s (1970 [1986]) insistence on taking eternal sentences as\nthe subjects of the instances of (ES-sent) (cf. Field 1994a,\n278\u201381). So, Field\u2019s view addresses some of the concerns\nthat David (1994, 130\u201366) raises for disquotationalism. However,\nan abiding concern about this variety of deflationism is that it is an\naccount of truth as applied specifically to sentences. This opens the\ndoor to a version of the complaint that Strawson (1950) makes against\nAustin\u2019s account of truth, that it is not one\u2019s act of\nstating [here: the sentence one utters] but what thereby gets stated\nthat is the target of a truth ascription. William Alston (1996, 14)\nmakes a similar point. While disquotationalists do not worry much\nabout this, this scope restriction might strike others as problematic\nbecause it raises questions about how we are to understand truth\napplied to beliefs or judgments, something that Hill (2002) worries\nabout. Field (1978) treats beliefs as mental states relating thinkers\nto sentences (of a language of thought). But David (1994, 172\u20137)\nraises worries for applying disquotationalism to beliefs, even in the\ncontext of an account like Field\u2019s. The view that we believe\nsentences remains highly controversial, but it is one that, it seems,\na Field-style disquotationalist must endorse. Similarly, such\ndisquotationalists must take scientific theories to consist of sets of\nsentences, in order for truth to be applicable to them. This too runs\nup against Strawson\u2019s complaint because it suggests that one\ncould not state the same theory in a different language. These sorts\nof concerns continue to press for disquotationalists.\n",
