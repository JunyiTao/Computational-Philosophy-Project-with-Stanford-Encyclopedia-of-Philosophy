    "main_text": "The Pragmatic View || Theory Structure per the Pragmatic View\n4.1 Theory Structure per the Pragmatic View\n\nWe should distinguish two strands of the Pragmatic View: the\nPragmatic View of Models and a proper Pragmatic View of\nTheories. \n4.1.1 The Pragmatic View of Models\n\nNancy Cartwright\u2019s How the Laws of Physics Lie\ncrystallized the Pragmatic View of Models. Under Cartwright\u2019s\nanalysis, models are the appropriate level of investigation for\nphilosophers trying to understand science. She argues for significant\nlimitations of theory (thesis #1), claiming that laws of nature are\nrarely true, and are epistemically weak. Theory as a collection of\nlaws cannot, therefore, support the many kinds of inferences and\nexplanations that we have come to expect it to license. Cartwright\nurges us to turn to models and modeling, which are central to\nscientific practice. Moreover, models\n\u201clie\u201d\u2014figuratively and literally\u2014between\ntheory and the world (cf. Derman 2011). That is, \u201cto explain a\nphenomenon is to find a model that fits it into the basic framework of\nthe theory and that thus allows us to derive analogues for the messy\nand complicated phenomenological laws which are true of it.\u201d A\nplurality of models exist, and models \u201cserve a variety of\npurposes\u201d (Cartwright 1983, 152; cf. Suppes 1978). Cartwright is\ninterested in the practices and purposes of scientific models, and\nasks us to focus on models rather than theories.\n\nCartwright\u2019s insights into model pluralism and model practices\nstand as a significant contribution of \u201cThe Stanford\nSchool\u201d (cf. Cat 2014), and were further developed by the\n\u201cmodels as mediators\u201d group, with participants at LSE,\nUniversity of Amsterdam, and University of Toronto (Morgan and\nMorrison 1999; Chang 2011; cf. Mart\u00ednez 2003). This group\ninsisted on the internal pluralism of model components (thesis #2).\nAccording to Morgan and Morrison, building a model involves\n\u201cfitting together\u2026 bits which come from disparate\nsources,\u201d including \u201cstories\u201d (Morgan and Morrison\n1999, 15). Boumans (1999) writes:\n\n\nmodel building is like baking a cake without a recipe. The ingredients\nare theoretical ideas, policy views, mathematisations of the cycle,\nmetaphors and empirical facts. (67)\n\nMathematical moulding is shaping the ingredients in such a\nmathematical form that integration is possible\u2026 (90)\n\n\nIn an instructive diagram, Boumans suggests that a variety of factors\nbesides theory and data feed into a model: metaphors, analogies,\npolicy views, stylised facts, mathematical techniques, and\nmathematical concepts (93). The full range of components involved in a\nmodel will likely vary according to discipline, and with respect to\nexplanations and interventions sought (e.g., analogies but not policy\nviews will be important in theoretical physics). In short, model\nbuilding involves a complex variety of internal nonformal aspects,\nsome of which are implicit (theses #2 and #3).\n\nAs one example of a nonformal component of model construction and\nmodel structure, consider metaphors and analogies (e.g., Bailer-Jones\n2002). Geary (2011) states the \u201csimplest equation\u201d of\nmetaphor thus: \u201c\\(X = Y\\)\u201d (8, following Aristotle:\n\u201cMetaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to\nsomething else\u2026 ,\u201d Poetics, 1457b). The line\nbetween metaphor and analogy in science is blurry. Some interlocutors\nsynonymize them (e.g., Hoffman 1980; Brown 2003), others reduce one to\nthe other (analogy is a form of metaphor, Geary 2011; metaphor is a\nkind of analogy, Gentner 1982, 2003), and yet others bracket one to\nfocus on the other (e.g., Oppenheimer 1956 sets aside metaphor). One\nway to distinguish them is to reserve \u201canalogy\u201d for\nconcrete comparisons, with clearly identifiable and demarcated source\nand target domains, and with specific histories, and use\n\u201cmetaphor\u201d for much broader and indeterminate comparisons,\nwith diffuse trajectories across discourses. Analogies include the\n\u201clines of force\u201d of electricity and magnetism (Maxwell and\nFaraday), the atom as a planetary system (Rutherford and Bohr), the\nbenzene ring as a snake biting its own tail (Kekul\u00e9),\nDarwin\u2019s \u201cnatural selection\u201d and \u201centangled\nbank,\u201d and behavioral \u201cdrives\u201d (Tinbergen) (e.g.,\nHesse 1966, 1967; Bartha 2010). Examples of metaphor are\ngenetic information, superorganism, and networks (e.g., Keller 1995).\nMore could be said about other informal model components, but this\ndiscussion of metaphors and analogies shall suffice to hint at how\nmodels do not merely lie between theory and world. Models express a\nrich internal pluralism (see also de Chadarevian and Hopwood 2004;\nMorgan 2012). \n\nModel complexity can also be seen in the external plurality of models\n(thesis #2). Not all models are mathematical, or even ideally recast\nas mathematical. Non-formalized (i.e., non\u2013state-space,\nnon-set-/model-theoretic) models such as physical, diagrammatic,\nmaterial, historical, \u201cremnant,\u201d and fictional models are\nubiquitous across the sciences (e.g., Frigg and Hartmann 2012; for the\nbiological sciences, see Hull 1975; Beatty 1980; Griesemer 1990, 1991\na, b, 2013; Downes 1992; Richards 1992; Winther 2006a; Leonelli\n2008; Weisberg 2013). Moreover, computer simulations differ in\nimportant respects from more standard analytical mathematical models\n(e.g., Smith 1996; Winsberg 2010; Weisberg 2013). According to some\n(e.g., Griesemer 2013; Downes 1992; Godfrey-Smith 2006; Thomson-Jones\n2012), this diversity belies claims by semanticists that models can\nalways be cast \u201cinto set theoretic terms\u201d (Lloyd 2013 In\nPress), are \u201calways a mathematical structure\u201d (van\nFraassen 1970, 327), or that \u201cformalisation of a theory is an\nabstract representation of the theory expressed in a formal deductive\nframework\u2026 in first-order predicate logic with identity, in set\ntheory, in matrix algebra and indeed, any branch of\nmathematics...\u201d (Thompson 2007, 485\u20136). Even so, internal\npluralism has been interpreted as supporting a \u201cdeflationary\nsemantic view,\u201d which is minimally committed to the perspective\nthat \u201cmodel construction is an important part of scientific\ntheorizing\u201d (Downes 1992, 151). Given the formal and\nmathematical framework of the Semantic View (see above), however, the\nbroad plurality of kinds of models seems to properly belong under a\nPragmatic View of Models.\n4.1.2 The Pragmatic View of Theories\n\nInterestingly, while critiquing the Syntactic and Semantic Views on\nmost matters, the Pragmatic View of Models construed theory, the\nprocess of theorizing, and the structure of scientific theories,\naccording to terms set by the two earlier views. For instance,\nCartwright tends to conceive of theory as explicit, mathematical,\nabstract, and so forth (see the first paragraph of Section 4). She\nalways resisted \u201cthe traditional syntactic/semantic view of\ntheory\u201d for its \u201cvending machine\u201d view, in which a\ntheory is a deductive and automated machine that upon receiving\nempirical input \u201cgurgitates\u201d and then \u201cdrops out the\nsought-for representation\u201d (1999a, 184\u20135). Rather than\nreform Syntactic and Semantic accounts of theory and theory structure,\nhowever, she invites us, as we just saw, to think of science as\nmodeling, \u201cwith theory as one small component\u201d\n(Cartwright, Shomar, and Su\u00e1rez 1995, 138; Su\u00e1rez and\nCartwright 2008). Many have followed her. Kitcher\u2019s predilection\nis also to accept the terms of the Syntactic and Semantic Views. For\ninstance, he defines theories as \u201caxiomatic deductive\nsystems\u201d (1993, 93). In a strategy complementary to\nCartwright\u2019s modeling turn, Kitcher encourages us to focus on\npractice, including practices of modeling and even practices of\ntheorizing. In The Advancement of Science, practice is\nanalyzed as a 7-tuple, with the following highly abbreviated\ncomponents: (i) a language; (ii) questions; (iii) statements\n(pictures, diagrams); (iv) explanatory patterns; (v) standard\nexamples; (vi) paradigms of experimentation and observation, plus\ninstruments and tools; and (vii) methodology (Kitcher 1993, 74).\nScientific practice is also center stage for those singing the praises\nof \u201cthe experimental life\u201d (e.g., Hacking 1983; Shapin and\nSchaffer 1985; Galison 1987), and those highlighting the cognitive\ngrounds of science (e.g., Giere 1988; Mart\u00ednez 2014) and\nscience\u2019s social and normative context (e.g., Kitcher 1993,\n2001; Longino 1995, 2002; Ziman 2000; cf. Simon 1957). Indeed, the\nmodeling and practice turns in the philosophy of science were\nreasonable reactions to the power of axiomatic reconstructive and\nmathematical modeling analyses of the structure of scientific\ntheories. \n\nYet, a Pragmatic View of Theories is also afoot, one\nresisting orthodox characterizations of theory often embraced, at\nleast early on, by Pragmatic View philosophers such as Cartwright,\nHacking, Kitcher, and Longino. For instance, Craver (2002) accepts\nboth the Syntactic and Semantic Views, which he humorously and not\ninaccurately calls \u201cthe Once Received View\u201d and the\n\u201cModel Model View.\u201d But he also observes:\n\nWhile these analyses have advanced our understanding of some formal\naspects of theories and their uses, they have neglected or obscured\nthose aspects dependent upon nonformal patterns in theories.\nProgress can be made in understanding scientific theories by attending\nto their diverse nonformal patterns and by identifying the axes along\nwhich such patterns might differ from one another. (55)\n\n\nCraver then turns to mechanistic theory as a third theory type (and a\nthird philosophical analysis of theory structure) that highlights\nnonformal patterns:\n\nDifferent types of mechanisms can be distinguished on the basis of\nrecurrent patterns in their organization. Mechanisms may be organized\nin series, in parallel, or in cycles. They may contain branches and\njoins, and they often include feedback and feedforward subcomponents.\n(71)\n\n\nConsistent with theses #2 and #3 of the Pragmatic View, we must\nrecognize the internal pluralism of theories as including nonformal\ncomponents. Some of these are used to represent organizational and\ncompositional relations of complex systems (Craver 2007; Wimsatt 2007; Winther 2011; Walsh 2015). While mechanistic analyses such as\nCraver\u2019s may not wish to follow every aspect of the Pragmatic\nView of Theories, there are important and deep resonances between the\ntwo.\n\nIn a review of da Costa and French (2003), Contessa (2006) writes:\n\nPhilosophers of science are increasingly realizing that the\ndifferences between the syntactic and the semantic view are less\nsignificant than semanticists would have it and that, ultimately,\nneither is a suitable framework within which to think about scientific\ntheories and models. The crucial divide in philosophy of science, I\nthink, is not the one between advocates of the syntactic view and\nadvocates of the semantic view, but the one between those who think\nthat philosophy of science needs a formal framework or other and those\nwho think otherwise. (376)\n\n\nAgain, we are invited to develop a non-formal framework of science and\npresumably also of scientific theory. (Halvorson 2012, 203 takes\nContessa 2006 to task for advocating \u201cinformal philosophy of\nscience.\u201d) Moreover, in asking \u201cwhat should the content of\na given theory be taken to be on a given occasion?\u201d, Vickers\n(2009) answers:\n\nIt seems clear that, in addition to theories being vague objects in\nthe way that \u2018heaps\u2019 of sand are, there will be\nfundamentally different ways to put together theoretical assumptions\ndepending on the particular investigation one is undertaking. For\nexample, sometimes it will be more appropriate to focus on the\nassumptions which were used by scientists, rather than the\nones that were believed to be true. (247, footnote\nsuppressed)\n\n\nA Pragmatic View of Theories helps make explicit nonformal internal\ncomponents of theory structure. \n\nKey early defenders of the modeling and practice turns have also\nrecently begun to envision theory in a way distinct from the terms set\nby the Syntactic and Semantic Views. Su\u00e1rez and Cartwright\n(2008) extend and distribute theory by arguing that \u201cWhat we\nknow \u2018theoretically\u2019 is recorded in a vast number of\nplaces in a vast number of different ways\u2014not just in words and\nformulae but in machines, techniques, experiments and applications as\nwell\u201d (79). And while her influence lies primarily in the\nmodeling turn, even in characterizing the \u201cvending\nmachine\u201d view, Cartwright calls for a \u201creasonable\nphilosophical account of theories\u201d that is \u201cmuch more\ntextured, and\u2026 much more laborious\u201d than that adopted by\nthe Syntactic and Semantic Views (1999a, 185). The theory-data and\ntheory-world axes need to be rethought. In her 2019 book on\n\u201cartful modeling\u201d, Cartwright emphasizes the importance of\nknow-how and creativity in scientific practice, and \u201cpraise[s]\nengineers and cooks and inventors, as well as experimental physicists\nlike Millikan and Melissa Franklin\u201d (Cartwright 2019, 76).\nKitcher wishes to transform talk of theories into discussion of\n\u201csignificance graphs\u201d (2001, 78 ff.). These are network\ndiagrams illustrating which (and how) questions are considered\nsignificant in the context of particular scientific communities and\nnorms (cf. Brown 2010). Consistently with a Pragmatic View of\nTheories, Morrison (2007) reconsiders and reforms canonical\nconceptualizations of \u201ctheory.\u201d Finally, Longino (2013)\nproposes an archaeology of assumptions behind and under different\nresearch programs and theories of human behavior such as\nneurobiological, molecular behavioral genetic, and\nsocial-environmental approaches (e.g., Oyama 2000). For instance, two\nshared or recurring assumptions across programs and theories are:\n\n(1) that the approach in question has methods of measuring both the\nbehavioral outcome that is the object of investigation and the factors\nwhose association with it are the topic of investigation and (2) that\nthe resulting measurements are exportable beyond the confines of the\napproach within which they are made. (Longino 2013, 117)\n\n\nA Pragmatic View of Theories expands the notion of theory to include\nnonformal aspects, which surely must include elements from\nBoumans\u2019 list above (e.g., metaphors, analogies, policy views),\nas well as more standard components such as ontological assumptions\n(e.g., Kuhn 1970; Levins and Lewontin 1985; Winther 2006b), natural\nkinds (e.g., Hacking 2007b), and conditions of application or scope\n(e.g., Longino 2013).\n\nIn addition to exploring internal theory diversity and in parallel\nwith plurality of modeling, a Pragmatic View of Theories could also\nexplore pluralism of modes of theorizing, and of philosophically\nanalyzing theoretical structure (thesis #2). Craver (2002) provides a\nstart in this direction in that he accepts three kinds of scientific\ntheory and of philosophical analysis of scientific theory. A more\nsynoptic view of the broader pragmatic context in which theories are\nembedded can be found in the literature on different\n\u201cstyles\u201d of scientific reasoning and theorizing (e.g.,\nCrombie 1994, 1996; Vicedo 1995; Pickstone 2000; Davidson 2001;\nHacking 2002, 2009; Winther 2012b; Elwick 2007; Mancosu\n2010). While there is no univocal or dominant classification of\nstyles, two lessons are important. First, a rough consensus exists\nthat theoretical investigations of especially historical, mechanistic,\nand mathematical structures and relations will involve different\nstyles. Second, each style integrates theoretical products and\ntheorizing processes in unique ways, thus inviting an irreducible\npragmatic methodological pluralism in our philosophical analysis of\nthe structure of scientific theories. For instance, the structure of\ntheories of mechanisms in molecular biology or neuroscience involves\nflow charts, and is distinct from the\nstructure of theories of historical processes and patterns as found in\nsystematics and phylogenetics, which involves phylogenetic trees. As Crombie suggests, we need a\n\u201ccomparative historical anthropology of thinking.\u201d (1996,\n71; see Hacking 2009) Mathematical theory hardly remains regnant. It\ngives way to a pluralism of theory forms and theory processes. Indeed,\neven mathematical theorizing is a pluralistic motley, as Hacking\n(2014) argues. Although a \u201cdeflationary\u201d Semantic View\ncould account for pluralism of theory forms, the Pragmatic View of\nTheories, drawing on styles, is required to do justice to the immense\nvariety of theorizing processes, and of philosophical accounts of\ntheory and theory structure. \n\nFinally, outstanding work remains in sorting out the philosophical\nutility of a variety of proposed units in addition to styles, such as\nKuhn\u2019s (1970) paradigms, Lakatos\u2019 (1980) research\nprogrammes, Laudan\u2019s (1977) research traditions, and\nHolton\u2019s (1988) themata. A rational comparative historical\nanthropology of both theorizing and philosophical analyses of\ntheorizing remains mostly unmapped (cf. Matheson and Dallmann 2014).\nSuch a comparative meta-philosophical analysis should also address\nDavidson\u2019s (1974) worries about \u201cconceptual schemes\u201d\nand Popper\u2019s (1996 [1976]) critique of \u201cthe myth of the\nframework\u201d (see Hacking 2002; Godfrey-Smith 2003).\n",
