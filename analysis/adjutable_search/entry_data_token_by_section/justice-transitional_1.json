    "main_text": "Introduction to Transitional Justice || The Contradictions of Transitional Justice\n1.1 The Contradictions of Transitional Justice\n\n\nIn making the transition from a violent past into settled, legitimate\ngovernance, officials typically pursue multiple goals. While some of\nthese are mutually reinforcing, others come into conflict with each\nother. As a result it is difficult to fully pursue all transitional\ngoals at the same time. In what follows I describe the most important\ntransitional goals and elaborate about the relationships between\nthem.\n\nCreating a reliable record of past human rights\nabuses. Such a record is obviously important, for its own sake,\nas part of the very human project of keeping our history as accurately\nas\n possible.[3]\n It\nis also helpful in rebuffing spurious revisionist claims (thus, for\nexample, the record created by the Nuremberg trials has been helpful\nin rejecting the claims of various Holocaust deniers) and, more\nbroadly, in ending the displays of impunity so typical of\nauthoritarian governments. Once such a record is established it\nbecomes impossible for those who colluded with an oppressive regime to\ndeny responsibility and involvement in past\n crimes.[4]\n Perhaps most\nimportantly, the creation of an accurate, comprehensive, and public\nhistorical record matters for the psychological healing of victims who\nreport, time and again, benefitting from official and public\nacknowledgement of their suffering (see, e.g., Minow 2000).\n\nSetting up a functional, professional bureaucracy and civil\nservice, to efficiently serve the needs of the population. As\nwith the cementing of the rule of law, part of the idea is to\nestablish (or reestablish) citizens' trust in their government; once\nbasic services are rendered in a reliable, non-arbitrary, fashion\nordinary citizens may gain (or regain) the belief that government's\njob is to serve rather than oppress them.\nHelping victims restructure and repair their lives, by\nattending to their physical and psychological afflictions, restituting\nlost property, compensating them for their losses, and fixing\nhistorical injustices that systematically disadvantaged them. Needless\nto say, this project overlaps with the second and third goals; after\nall, to address the psychological distress of victims it is helpful to\npunish those who hurt them and to provide respectful forums in which\nthe stories of such victims can be heard.\nStopping violence and consolidating stability, so as to\nallow the creation of a normal civic and commercial life, cement trust\nin government, and draw outside investments.\n\n While all of these goals are politically important, it is easy to\nsee how they can come into conflict. Prosecuting the guilty can harm\npolitical stability, as the prosecuted and their (often armed)\nfollowers become resentful about what they perceive as a politically\nmotivated witch-hunt. Post-war prosecutions may also come into\nconflict with the need to cement the rule of law, as such prosecutions\noften require departures from the rules of procedural justice. Such\nwas the case with the retroactive criminalization that lay at the\nheart of the Nuremberg Trials. The doctrine of \u201cCommand\nResponsibility\u201d first developed at Nuremberg and used later by\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia also departs from\nbasic principles of legalism, by basing convictions on the status of\ndefendants rather than on direct and specific evidence concerning\ntheir actions (on this, see Drumbl 2005).\n\n\nEven when prosecutions do not threaten political stability and manage\nto stay true to the principles of the rule of law, they can still come\ninto conflict with the desire to create a robust, comprehensive\nhistorical record. When trials are used as the primary mechanism of\ntransitional justice, their very subjection to the rules of evidence\nmeans that some important information (namely testimony that does not\npertain to specific indictments, or evidence obtained without full due\nprocess etc.) will be excluded from the record. This limitation has\nprompted some scholars to argue that truth commissions are preferable\nto war crime trials in this respect: since such commissions are not\nsubject to the rules of evidence, they are able to collect more\ninformation, expose a more comprehensive picture of past injustices\nand to include a greater emphasis on the role of institutional and\ncommercial actors indirectly involved in\n supporting\ninjustices.[5]\n\n\n\nThe need to provide victims with meaningful, respectful public forums\nin which they can tell their stories and receive a degree of\nacknowledgment, central to the fifth aim, also comes into conflict\nwith some of the basic commitments of legalism. Criminal trials\nusually focus on the interests of the defendants. A respectable\ncriminal trial cannot be a platform for victims to tell their stories\nin an uninterrupted fashion. Since the testimony of victims is\ninstrumental for proving indictments, it is most often subject to\ninterruptions and vigorous cross-examination. As a result, a typical\ncriminal procedure can be quite an adversarial experience for\nvictims. This is true in spite of a recent expansion of the role of\nvictims in international criminal law. In fact, an undue expansion of\nthat role creates the grounds for criticizing international criminal\nlaw for abandoning some of its legalist underpinnings (see, for\nexample, Rauschenbach and Scalia 2008).\n\nFinally, the need to set up a functioning bureaucracy, so important\nfor the creation of public trust and the restoration of political\nnormalcy, can clash with the desire for accountability inherent in the\nfirst two goals. When most officials implicated in past crimes are\npurged or \u201clustrated\u201d, few competent administrators remain\nto do the work of government. Such a competence gap may, in turn,\nundermine political stability, economic viability, and public\ntrust\u2014all crucial factors in a successful transition. Indeed,\nworries about the tradeoff between accountability and the\nfunctionality of government have led many polities to either hedge or\ngive up their lustration policies\n mid-stream.[6]\n\n\n\nAlmost every transition since World War II displays these tensions.\nThe Nuremberg trials, often viewed as the pinnacle of legalism, were,\nnevertheless, based on ex post facto charges (see Bass 2002:\nCh. 5).  The Spanish transition to democracy was so fragile that it\nhad to commit itself to a \u201cpact of forgetting\u201d\u2014more\nthan three decades of silence about abuses committed during the civil\nwar and under Franco. Historical justice and the need to preserve the\npeace came into conflict, with the latter receiving precedence until\nthe 2008 Law of Historical Memory reversed the trend (see Tremlett\n2006).  In South Africa, de Klerk's National Party threatened civil\nwar if the African National Congress insisted on war crime trials\nagainst apartheid officials. The celebrated Truth and Reconciliation\nCommission, with its amnesty-for-truth arrangement, was the resulting\npolitical compromise meant to avoid both punishment and impunity. The\nANC's demand for retributive justice went unheeded (to the outrage of\nmany, including the family of Stephen Biko, who unsuccessfully sued\nthe Truth Commission in the South African Constitutional Court)\nbecause heeding it would have eliminated the chance for a democratic\nSouth Africa (for an overview see Meredith 1999).  The International\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda, operating in Tanzania, netted some of\nthe Genocide's ringleaders. But Rwanda was not able to apply rigorous\ncriminal responsibility to all those who participated in the murders.\nDoing so would have taken several centuries. Thus a system of\ntraditional justice, Gacaca, was devised. These makeshift\n\u201cGrass Courts\u201d failed to live up to western standards of\nlegalism (the judges were not professionals, rules of evidence were\nnot followed) and it failed to produce satisfying punishments. But it\ndid provide a platform from which at least some of the crimes were\nadmitted and acknowledged, and it did manage to empty the Rwandan\njails which contained hundred of thousands of prisoners. In the\ntension between practical functionality and retributive justice,\nRwanda nodded to the latter, but eventually focused on the former.\nThe policy of de-Baathification carried out negligently in the\naftermath of the second Gulf War, combined with the thoughtless\ndisbanding of the Iraqi army ended up fueling the anti-American\ninsurgency there, in addition to draining Iraq of many of those who\nhad crucial administrate skills and experience. Here too, the\ncommitment to retribution and the desire to create trust by\n\u201ccleaning out\u201d those associated with the previous regime\nactually ended up bringing about the opposite effects by further\ndestabilizing the country and harming its bureaucratic competence at a\nvery sensitive time (see Pfiffner 2010).\n",
