    "main_text": "Early Responses || Heisenberg\n4.3 Heisenberg\n\nAs Jagdish Mehra and Helmut Rechenberg (1982) have recounted, when\nWerner Heisenberg first arrived in Copenhagen to work with Bohr in\n1924, he enthusiastically embraced the correspondence principle and\ntook up the task of defending this principle to the broader physics\ncommunity. This is especially clear in a letter Heisenberg wrote to\nPauli on September 30th, 1924:\n\nTogether with Bohr I have again examined the problem carefully, and we\narrived at the conclusion that it is not\u2014as Sommerfeld\nsays\u2014that the sum-rules cannot be understood with the help of\nthe correspondence principle; on the contrary they are a necessary\nconsequence of the correspondence principle\u2026 We are very\nhappy about this interpretation for now the attacks against the\ncorrespondence principle are completely refuted\u2026 [S]ince\nrecently the correspondence principle has been blamed so much, it\nwould be good to publish it [your results confirming the\ncorrespondence principle] ad majorem correspondentiae principii\ngloriam [for the greater glory of the correspondence principle].\n(Heisenberg to Pauli, September 30th, 1924; quoted in Mehra\nand Rechenberg pp. 156\u2013157)\n\n\nBy 1925, however, Heisenberg increasingly began to distance himself\nfrom the correspondence principle. Daniel Serwer attributes this shift\nin Heisenberg\u2019s views to Pauli\u2019s influence:\n\n[I]n early March 1925, Pauli came to Copenhagen. This visit was\ncrucial to Heisenberg. Under pressure from Pauli, he began to change\nhis views on many issues\u2026[including] the Correspondence\nPrinciple. \u2026But until Pauli\u2019s visit, Heisenberg had\nremained convinced that \u2026 the Correspondence Principle would\nbring results. (Serwer 1977, p. 222)\n\n\nDespite the fact that Heisenberg relied heavily on the correspondence\nprinciple in developing matrix mechanics, he no longer publicly\ndefended\n it.[9]\n Indeed as Mara Beller has noted, \u201cHeisenberg does not cite\nBohr\u2019s work at all [in the 1925 matrix mechanics paper], despite\nthe fact that the paper was built on Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple in a fundamental way\u2026 Instead Heisenberg\n[inaccurately] presented his work as flowing from the positivist\nprinciple of elimination of unobservables\u201d (Beller 1999, p.\n 140).[10]\n Heisenberg expresses his increasing ambivalence towards the\ncorrespondence principle in his book The Physical Principles of\nthe Quantum Theory:\n\nIt is true that an ingenious combination of arguments based on the\ncorrespondence principle can make the quantum theory of matter\ntogether with a classical theory of radiation furnish quantitative\nvalues for the transition probabilities\u2026 Such a formulation of\nthe radiation problem is far from satisfactory, however, and easily\nleads to false conclusions. (Heisenberg 1930, p. 82)\n\n\nWhile Heisenberg is willing to admit the limited utility of the\nprinciple, he does not view it as a fundamental principle of quantum\ntheory the way that Bohr does. Instead Heisenberg argues that\n\u201c[i]t must be emphasized that this [correspondence] is a purely\nformal result; it does not follow from any of the physical principles\nof quantum theory\u201d (Heisenberg 1930, p. 83). In other words, the\ncorrespondence is to be interpreted as a purely mathematical result,\nnot as revealing any deep connection between the quantum and classical\ntheories, and certainly not as a principle of quantum theory itself.\nFor Heisenberg, quantum mechanics is a closed theory\n[Abgeschlossene Theorie], an axiomatic system complete in\nitself, not one that in any way depends on classical\n mechanics.[11]\n",
