    "main_text": "Berkeley\u2019s positive program:  idealism and common sense || Replies to objections\n3.2 Replies to objections\n\n With the basic ingredients of Berkeley\u2019s ontology in place, we can\nbegin to consider how his system works by seeing how he responds to a\nnumber of intuitively compelling objections to it. Berkeley himself\nsees very well how necessary this is: Much of the Principles\nis structured as a series of objections and replies, and in the\nThree Dialogues, once Philonous has rendered Hylas a\nreluctant convert to idealism, he devotes the rest of the book to\nconvincing him that this is a philosophy which coheres well with\ncommon sense, at least better than materialism ever did.\n3.2.1 Real things vs. imaginary ones\n\n Perhaps the most obvious objection to idealism is that it makes real\nthings no different from imaginary ones\u2014both seem fleeting\nfigments of our own minds, rather than the solid objects of the\nmaterialists. Berkeley replies that the distinction between real\nthings and chimeras retains its full force on his view. One way of\nmaking the distinction is suggested by his argument for the existence\nof God, examined above: Ideas which depend on our own finite human\nwills are not (constituents of) real things. Not being voluntary is\nthus a necessary condition for being a real thing, but it is clearly\nnot sufficient, since hallucinations and dreams do not depend on our\nwills, but are nevertheless not real. Berkeley notes that the ideas\nthat constitute real things exhibit a steadiness, vivacity, and\ndistinctness that chimerical ideas do not. The most crucial feature\nthat he points to, however, is order.  The ideas imprinted by\nthe author of nature as part of rerum natura occur in regular\npatterns, according to the laws of nature (\u201cthe set rules or\nestablished methods, wherein the mind we depend on excites in us the\nideas of sense, are called the Laws of Nature\u201d PHK 30). They are\nthus regular and coherent, that is, they constitute a coherent real\nworld.\n3.2.2 Hidden structures and internal mechanisms\n\n The related notions of regularity and of the laws of nature are\ncentral to the workability of Berkeley\u2019s idealism. They allow him to\nrespond to the following objection, put forward in PHK 60:\n\n \u2026it will be demanded to what purpose serves that curious\norganization of plants, and the admirable mechanism in the parts of\nanimals; might not vegetables grow, and shoot forth leaves and\nblossoms, and animals perform all their motions, as well without as\nwith all that variety of internal parts so elegantly contrived and put\ntogether, which being ideas have nothing powerful or operative in\nthem, nor have any necessary connexion with the effects ascribed to\nthem?  [\u2026] And how comes it to pass, that whenever there is any\nfault in the going of a watch, there is some corresponding disorder to\nbe found in the movements, which being mended by a skilful hand, all\nis right again? The like may be said of all the clockwork of Nature,\ngreat part whereof is so wonderfully fine and subtle, as scarce to be\ndiscerned by the best microscope. In short, it will be asked, how upon\nour principles any tolerable account can be given, or any final cause\nassigned of an innumerable multitude of bodies and machines framed\nwith the most exquisite art, which in the common philosophy have very\napposite uses assigned them, and serve to explain abundance of\nphenomena.\n \n\n Berkeley\u2019s answer, for which he is indebted to\n Malebranche,[14]\n is that, although God could make a watch run (that is, produce in us\nideas of a watch running) without the watch having any internal\nmechanism (that is, without it being the case that, were we to open\nthe watch, we would have ideas of an internal mechanism), he cannot do\nso if he is to act in accordance with the laws of nature, which he has\nestablished for our benefit, to make the world regular and\npredictable. Thus, whenever we have ideas of a working watch, we will\nfind that if we open\n it,[15]\n we will see (have ideas of) an appropriate internal\nmechanism. Likewise, when we have ideas of a living tulip, we will\nfind that if we pull it apart, we will observe the usual internal\nstructure of such plants, with the same transport tissues,\nreproductive parts, etc.\n3.2.3 Scientific explanation\n\n Implicit in the answer above is Berkeley\u2019s insightful account of\nscientific explanation and the aims of science. A bit of background is\nneeded here to see why this issue posed a special challenge for\nBerkeley. One traditional understanding of science, derived from\nAristotle, held that it aims at identifying the causes of\nthings. Modern natural philosophers such as Descartes narrowed\nscience\u2019s domain to efficient causes and thus held that\nscience should reveal the efficient causes of natural things,\nprocesses, and\n events.[16] \n Berkeley considers this as the source of an objection at Principles\n51:\n\n Seventhly, it will upon this be demanded whether it does not seem\nabsurd to take away natural causes, and ascribe every thing to the\nimmediate operation of spirits? We must no longer say upon these\nprinciples that fire heats, or water cools, but that a spirit heats,\nand so forth. Would not a man be deservedly laughed at, who should\ntalk after this manner? I answer, he would so; in such things we ought\nto think with the learned, and speak with the vulgar.\n\n On Berkeley\u2019s account, the true cause of any phenomenon is a\nspirit, and most often it is the same spirit, namely, God. \n\n But surely, one might object, it is a step backwards to abandon our\nscientific theories and simply note that God causes what happens in\nthe physical world!  Berkeley\u2019s first response here, that we should\nthink with the learned but speak with the vulgar, advises us to\ncontinue to say that fire heats, that the heart pumps blood, etc.\nWhat makes this advice legitimate is that he can reconstrue such talk\nas being about regularities in our ideas. In Berkeley\u2019s view, the\npoint of scientific inquiry is to reveal such regularities:\n\n If therefore we consider the difference there is betwixt natural\nphilosophers and other men, with regard to their knowledge of the\nphenomena, we shall find it consists, not in an exacter\nknowledge of the efficient cause that produces them, for that can be\nno other than the will of a spirit, but only in a greater\nlargeness of comprehension, whereby analogies, harmonies, and\nagreements are discovered in the works of Nature, and the particular\neffects explained, that is, reduced to general rules, see\nSect. 62, which rules grounded on the analogy, and\nuniformness observed in the production of natural effects, are most\nagreeable, and sought after by the mind; for that they extend our\nprospect beyond what is present, and near to us, and enable us to make\nvery probable conjectures, touching things that may have happened at\nvery great distances of time and place, as well as to predict things\nto come\u2026. (PHK 105)\n \n\n Natural philosophers thus consider signs, rather than causes (PHK\n108), but their results are just as useful as they would be under a\nmaterialist system. Moreover, the regularities they discover provide\nthe sort of explanation proper to science, by rendering the particular\nevents they subsume unsurprising (PHK 104). The sort of explanation\nproper to science, then, is not causal explanation, but reduction to\n regularity.[17]\n3.2.4 Unperceived objects\u2014Principles vs. Dialogues\n\n Regularity provides a foundation for one of Berkeley\u2019s responses\nto the objection summarized in the famous limerick:\n\n There was a young man who said God, \n must think it exceedingly odd \n if he finds that the tree \n continues to be\n when no one\u2019s about in the\n Quad.[18]\n\n\n The worry, of course, is that if to be is to be perceived (for\nnon-spirits), then there are no trees in the Quad at 3 a.m. when no\none is there to perceive them and there is no furniture in my office\nwhen I leave and close the door. Interestingly, in the\nPrinciples Berkeley seems relatively unperturbed by this\nnatural objection to idealism. He claims that there is no problem\nfor\n\n \u2026anyone that shall attend to what is meant by the term\nexist when applied to sensible things. The table I write\non, I say, exists, that is, I see and feel it; and if I were out of my\nstudy I should say it existed, meaning thereby that if I was in my\nstudy I might perceive it, or that some other spirit actually does\nperceive it. (PHK 3)\n \n\n So, when I say that my desk still exists after I leave my office,\nperhaps I just mean that I would perceive it if I were in my office,\nor, more broadly, that a finite mind would perceive the desk were it\nin the appropriate circumstances (in my office, with the lights on,\nwith eyes open, etc.). This is to provide a sort of counterfactual\nanalysis of the continued existence of unperceived objects. The truth\nof the counterfactuals in question is anchored in regularity: because\nGod follows set patterns in the way he causes ideas, I would have a\ndesk idea if I were in the office.\n\n Unfortunately, this analysis has counterintuitive consequences when\ncoupled with the esse est percipi doctrine (McCracken 1979,\n286). If to be is, as Berkeley insists, to be perceived, then the\nunperceived desk does not exist, despite the fact that it\nwould be perceived and thus would exist if someone\nopened the office door. Consequently, on this view the desk would not\nendure uninterrupted but would pop in and out of existence, though it\nwould do so quite predictably. One way to respond to this worry would\nbe to dismiss it\u2014what does it matter if the desk ceases to exist\nwhen unperceived, as long as it exists whenever we need it?  Berkeley\nshows signs of this sort of attitude in Principles 45\u201346, where he\ntries to argue that his materialist opponents and scholastic\npredecessors are in much the same\n boat.[19] \n This \u201cwho cares?\u201d response to the problem of continued\nexistence is fair enough as far as it goes, but it surely does\nconflict with common sense, so if Berkeley were to take this route he\nwould have to moderate his claims about his system\u2019s ability to\naccommodate everything desired by the person on the street.\n\n Another strategy, however, is suggested by Berkeley\u2019s reference in\nPHK 3 and 48 to \u201csome other spirit,\u201d a strategy\nsummarized in a further limerick:\n\n  Dear Sir, your astonishment\u2019s odd \n  I am always about in the Quad \n  And that\u2019s why the tree  \n  continues to be \n  since observed by, Yours faithfully, God\n\n\n If the other spirit in question is God, an omnipresent being, then\nperhaps his perception can be used to guarantee a completely\ncontinuous existence to every physical object. In the Three\nDialogues, Berkeley very clearly invokes God in this\ncontext. Interestingly, whereas in the Principles, as we have\nseen above, he argued that God must exist in order to cause\nour ideas of sense, in the Dialogues (212, 214\u20135) he argues\nthat our ideas must exist in God when not perceived by\n us.[20]\n  If our ideas exist in God, then they presumably exist\ncontinuously. Indeed, they must exist continuously, since standard\nChristian doctrine dictates that God is unchanging. \n\n Although this solves one problem for Berkeley, it creates several\nmore. The first is that Berkeley\u2019s other commitments, religious and\nphilosophical, dictate that God cannot literally have our ideas. Our\nideas are sensory ideas and God is a being who \u201ccan suffer\nnothing, nor be affected with any painful sensation, or indeed any\nsensation at all\u201d (3D 206). Nor can our sensory ideas be copies\nof God\u2019s nonsensory ones (McCracken 1979):\n\n How can that which is sensible be like that which is insensible?  Can\na real thing in itself invisible be like a colour;\nor a real thing which is not audible, be like a\nsound? (3D 206)\n \n\n A second problem is that God\u2019s ideas are eternal, whereas physical\nobjects typically have finite duration. And, even worse, God has ideas\nof all possible objects (Pitcher 1977, 171\u20132), not just the ones which\nwe would commonsensically wish to say exist.\n\n  A solution (proposed by McCracken) to these related problems is to\ntie the continued existence of ordinary objects to God\u2019s will, rather\nthan to his understanding. McCracken\u2019s suggestion is that unperceived\nobjects continue to exist as God\u2019s decrees. Such an account in terms\nof divine decrees or volitions looks promising: The tree continues to\nexist when unperceived just in case God has an appropriate volition or\nintention to cause a tree-idea in finite perceivers under the right\ncircumstances.  Furthermore, this solution has important textual\nsupport: In the Three Dialogues, Hylas challenges Philonous\nto account for the creation, given that all existence is\nmind-dependent, in his view, but everything must exist eternally in\nthe mind of God. Philonous responds as follows:\n\n May we not understand it [the creation] to have been entirely in\nrespect of finite spirits; so that things, with regard to us, may\nproperly be said to begin their existence, or be created, when God\ndecreed they should become perceptible to intelligent creatures, in\nthat order and manner which he then established, and we now call the\nlaws of Nature? You may call this a relative, or\nhypothetical existence if you please. (3D 253)\n \n\n Here Berkeley ties the actual existence of created physical beings to\nGod\u2019s decrees, that is, to his will.\n\n  As with the counterfactual analysis of continued existence, however,\nthis account also fails under pressure from the esse est\npercipi principle:\n\n Hylas.  Yes, Philonous, I grant the existence of a sensible thing consists\nin being perceivable, but not in being actually perceived.\n\n\n Philonous.  And what is perceivable but an idea? And can an\nidea exist without being actually perceived?  These are points\nlong since agreed between us. (3D 234)\n \n\n\n Thus, if the only grounds of continued existence are\nvolitions in God\u2019s mind, rather than perceived items (ideas),\nthen ordinary objects do not exist continuously, but rather pop in and\nout of existence in a lawful fashion.\n\n Fortunately, Kenneth Winkler has put forward an interpretation which\ngoes a great distance towards resolving this difficulty. In effect, he\nproposes that we amend the \u201cvolitional\u201d interpretation of\nthe existence of objects with the hypothesis that Berkeley held\n\u201cthe denial of blind agency\u201d (Winkler 1989, 207\u2013224). This\nprinciple, which can be found in many authors of the period (including\nLocke), dictates that any volition must have an idea behind it, that\nis, must have a cognitive component that gives content to the\nvolition, which would otherwise be empty or \u201cblind\u201d. While\nthe principle is never explicitly invoked or argued for by Berkeley,\nin a number of passages he does note the interdependence of will and\nunderstanding. Winkler plausibly suggests that Berkeley may have found\nthis principle so obvious as to need no arguing. With it in place, we\nhave a guarantee that anything willed by God, e.g. that finite\nperceivers in appropriate circumstances should have elm tree ideas,\nalso has a divine idea associated with it. Furthermore, we have a neat\nexplanation of Berkeley\u2019s above-noted leap in the Dialogues\nfrom the claim that God must cause our ideas to the claim that our\nideas must exist in God. \n\n Of course, it remains true that God cannot have ideas that are,\nstrictly speaking, the same as ours. This problem is closely related\nto another that confronts Berkeley: Can two people ever perceive the\nsame thing?  Common sense demands that two students can perceive the\nsame tree, but Berkeley\u2019s metaphysics seems to dictate that they never\ntruly perceive the same thing, since they each have their own\nnumerically distinct ideas. One way to dissolve this difficulty is to\nrecall that objects are bundles of ideas.  Although two people cannot\nperceive/have the numerically same idea, they can perceive the same\nobject, assuming that perceiving a component of the bundle suffices\nfor perception of the\n bundle.[21]\n  Another proposal (Baxter 1991) is to invoke Berkeley\u2019s doctrine that\n\u201csame\u201d has both a philosophical and a vulgar sense (3D\n247) in order to declare that my tree-idea and your tree-idea are\nstrictly distinct but loosely (vulgarly) the same. Either account\nmight be applied in order to show either that God and I may perceive\nthe same object, or that God and I may perceive, loosely speaking, the\nsame thing. \n\n From this discussion we may draw a criterion for the actual existence\nof ordinary objects, one which summarizes Berkeley\u2019s considered\nviews:\n\n An X exists at time t if and only if God has an\nidea that corresponds to a volition that if a finite mind at\nt is in appropriate circumstances (e.g. in a particular\nplace, looking in the right direction, or looking through a\nmicroscope), then it will have an idea that we would be disposed to\ncall a perception of an X. \n\n\n\nThis captures the idea that\nexistence depends on God\u2019s perceptions, but only on the perceptions\nwhich correspond to or are included in his volitions about what\nwe should perceive. It also captures the fact that the\nbundling of ideas into objects is done by\n us.[22]\n3.2.5 The possibility of error\n\n A further worry about Berkeley\u2019s system arises from the\nidea-bundle account of\n objects.[23] \n If there is no mind-independent object against which to measure my\nideas, but rather my ideas help to constitute the object, then how can\nmy ideas ever fail\u2014how is error possible?  Here is another way\nto raise the worry that I have in mind: We saw above that\nBerkeley\u2019s arguments against commonsense realism in the first\nDialogue attempt to undermine (1) claims that heat, odor,\ntaste are distinguishable from pleasure/pain and (2) the claim that\nobjects have one true color, one true shape, one true taste, etc.  If\nwe then consider what this implies about Berkeleyian objects, we must\nconclude that Berkeley\u2019s cherry is red, purple, gray, tart, sweet,\nsmall, large, pleasant, and painful!  It seems that Berkeley\u2019s desire\nto refute the mechanist representationalism which dictates that\nobjects are utterly unlike our experience of them has lead\nhim to push beyond common sense to the view that objects are\nexactly like our experience of\n them.[24] \n There is no denying that Berkeley is out of sync with common sense\nhere. He does, however, have an account of error, as he shows us in\nthe Dialogues:\n\n Hylas. What say you to this? Since, according to you, men judge of\nthe reality of things by their senses, how can a man be mistaken in\nthinking the moon a plain lucid surface, about a foot in diameter; or a\nsquare tower, seen at a distance, round; or an oar, with one end in the\nwater, crooked?\n\n\n Philonous. He is not mistaken with regard to the ideas he actually\nperceives; but in the inferences he makes from his present perceptions.\nThus in the case of the oar, what he immediately perceives by sight is\ncertainly crooked; and so far he is in the right. But if he thence\nconclude, that upon taking the oar out of the water he shall perceive\nthe same crookedness; or that it would affect his touch, as crooked\nthings are wont to do: in that he is mistaken. (3D 238)\n\n\n Extrapolating from this, we may say that my gray idea of the cherry,\nformed in dim light, is not in itself wrong and forms a part of the\nbundle-object just as much as your red idea, formed in daylight.\nHowever, if I judge that the cherry would look gray in bright light,\nI\u2019m in error. Furthermore, following Berkeley\u2019s directive to speak\nwith the vulgar, I ought not to say (in ordinary circumstances) that\n\u201cthe cherry is gray,\u201d since that will be taken to imply\nthat the cherry would look gray to humans in daylight.\n3.2.6 Spirits and causation\n\n We have spent some time examining the difficulties Berkeley faces in\nthe \u201cidea/ordinary object\u201d half of his ontology.\nArguably, however, less tractable difficulties confront him in the\nrealm of spirits. Early on, Berkeley attempts to forestall materialist\nskeptics who object that we have no idea of spirit by arguing for this\nposition himself:\n\n A spirit is one simple, undivided, active being: as it perceives\nideas, it is called the understanding, and as it produces or\notherwise operates about them, it is called the will. Hence\nthere can be no idea formed of a soul or spirit: for all ideas\nwhatever, being passive and inert, vide Sect. 25, they cannot\nrepresent unto us, by way of image or likeness, that which acts. A\nlittle attention will make it plain to any one, that to have an idea\nwhich shall be like that active principle of motion and change of\nideas, is absolutely impossible. Such is the nature of spirit or that\nwhich acts, that it cannot be of it self perceived, but only by the\neffects which it produceth. (PHK 27)\n \n\n Surely the materialist will be tempted to complain, however, that\nBerkeley\u2019s unperceivable spiritual substances, lurking behind the\nscenes and supporting that which we can perceive, sound a lot like the\nmaterial substances which he so emphatically rejects. \n\n Two very different responses are available to Berkeley on this issue,\neach of which he seems to have made at a different point in his\nphilosophical development. One response would be to reject spiritual\nsubstance just as he rejected material substance.  Spirits, then,\nmight be understood in a Humean way, as bundles of ideas and\nvolitions. Fascinatingly, something like this view is considered by\nBerkeley in his early philosophical notebooks (see PC 577ff). Why he\nabandons it is an interesting and difficult\n question;[25]\n it seems that one worry he has is how the understanding and the will\nare to be integrated and rendered one thing. \n\n The second response would be to explain why spiritual substances are\nbetter posits than material ones. To this end, Berkeley emphasizes\nthat we have a notion of spirit, which is just to say that we know\nwhat the word means. This purportedly contrasts with\n\u201cmatter,\u201d which Berkeley thinks has no determinate\ncontent. Of course, the real question is: How does the term\n\u201cspirit\u201d come by any content, given that we have no idea\nof it?  In the Principles, Berkeley declares only that we\nknow spirit through our own case and that the content we assign to\n\u201cspirit\u201d is derived from the content each of us assigns to\n\u201cI\u201d (PHK 139\u2013140). In the Dialogues, however,\nBerkeley shows a better appreciation of the force of the problem that\nconfronts him:\n\n [Hylas.]  You say your own soul supplies you with some sort of\nan idea or image of God. But at the same time you acknowledge you have,\nproperly speaking, no idea of your own soul. You even affirm that\nspirits are a sort of beings altogether different from ideas.\nConsequently that no idea can be like a spirit. We have therefore no\nidea of any spirit. You admit nevertheless that there is spiritual\nsubstance, although you have no idea of it; while you deny there can be\nsuch a thing as material substance, because you have no notion or idea\nof it. Is this fair dealing? To act consistently, you must either admit\nmatter or reject spirit. (3D 232)\n \n\n To the main point of Hylas\u2019 attack, Philonous replies that each of us\nhas, in our own case, an immediate intuition of ourselves, that is, we\nknow our own minds through reflection (3D 231\u2013233).  Berkeley\u2019s\nconsidered position, that we gain access to ourselves as thinking\nthings through conscious awareness, is surely an intuitive\none. Nevertheless, it is disappointing that he never gave an explicit\nresponse to the Humean challenge he entertained in his notebooks:\n\n + \u00a0 Mind is a congeries of Perceptions. Take away Perceptions\n& you take away the Mind put the Perceptions & you put the\nmind.  (PC 580)\n \n\n A closely related problem which confronts Berkeley is how to make\nsense of the causal powers that he ascribes to spirits. Here again,\nthe notebooks suggest a surprisingly Humean view:\n\n+ \u00a0 The simple idea call\u2019d Power seems obscure or rather none at all. but\nonely the relation \u2018twixt cause & Effect. Wn I ask whether A can\nmove B. if A be an intelligent thing. I mean no more than whether the\nvolition of A that B move be attended with the motion of B, if A be\nsenseless whether the impulse of A against B be follow\u2019d by ye motion\nof B. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n 461[26]\n\nS \u00a0 What means Cause as distinguish\u2019d from Occasion? nothing but a Being\nwch wills wn the Effect follows the volition. Those things that happen\nfrom without we are not the Cause of therefore there is some other\nCause of them i.e., there is a being that wills these perceptions in\nus. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 499\n\nS \u00a0 There is a difference betwixt Power & Volition. There may be\nvolition without Power. But there can be no Power without Volition.\nPower implyeth volition & at the same time a Connotation of the\nEffects following the Volition. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  699\n\n\n 461 suggests the Humean view that a cause is whatever is\n (regularly)[27]\n followed by an effect. 499 and 699 revise this doctrine by requiring\nthat a cause not only (regularly) precede an effect but also be a\nvolition. Berkeley\u2019s talk of occasion here reveals the immediate\ninfluence of Malebranche.  Malebranche held that the only true cause\nis God and that apparent finite causes are only \u201coccasional\ncauses,\u201d which is to say that they provide occasions for God to\nact on his general volitional policies. Occasional\n\u201ccauses\u201d thus regularly precede their\n\u201ceffects\u201d but are not truly responsible for producing\nthem. In these notebook entries, however, Berkeley seems to be\nsuggesting that all there is to causality is this regular consequence,\nwith the first item being a volition. Such an account, unlike\nMalebranche\u2019s, would make my will and God\u2019s will causes in exactly the\nsame thin sense.\n\n Some commentators, most notably Winkler, suppose that Berkeley\nretains this view of causality in the published works. The main\ndifficulty with this interpretation is that Berkeley more than once\npurports to inspect our idea of body, and the sensory qualities\nincluded therein, and to conclude from that inspection that bodies are\npassive (DM 22, PHK 25). This procedure would make little sense if\nbodies, according to Berkeley, fail to be causes by definition, simply\nbecause they are not minds with\n wills.[28] \n What is needed is an explanation of what Berkeley means by\nactivity, which he clearly equates with causal power. Winkler (1989,\n130\u20131) supplies such an account, according to which activity means\ndirection towards an end. But this is to identify efficient causation\nwith final causation, a controversial move at best which Berkeley\nwould be making without comment or argument. \n\n The alternative would be to suppose, as De Motu 33 suggests,\nthat Berkeley holds that we gain a notion of activity, along with a\nnotion of spirit as substance, through reflective awareness/internal\nconsciousness:\n\n [W]e feel it [mind] as a faculty of altering both our own state and\nthat of other things, and that is properly called vital, and puts a\nwide distinction between soul and bodies. (DM 33)\n \n\n  On this interpretation, Berkeley would again have abandoned the\nradical Humean position entertained in his notebooks, as he clearly\ndid on the question of the nature of spirit. One can only speculate as\nto whether his reasons would have been primarily philosophical,\ntheological, or practical. Berkeley\u2019s writings, however, are not\ngenerally characterized by deference to authority, quite the\n contrary,[29]\n as he himself proclaims: \n\n\n\u2026 one thing, I know, I am not guilty of. I do not pin my\nfaith on the sleeve of any great man. I act not out of prejudice\n& prepossession. I do not adhere to any opinion because it is\nan old one, a receiv\u2019d one, a fashionable one, or one that I have spent\nmuch time in the study and cultivation of. (PC 465)\n ",
