    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n4. Natural Philosophy\n Studies concerning Giles\u2019 natural philosophy focused mainly on his\ntreatment of some pivotal concepts of Aristotle\u2019s Physics.  Cecilia\nTrifogli opened new perspectives in this field, devoting her attention\nto the notions of place and motion (especially in the void, see\nTrifogli 1992), underlining that \u201cGiles\u2019 emphasis on the\nrole of place in the description of motion seems to lead to a\nquantitative and relational notion of place. Giles, however, does not\ncompletely substitute the Aristotelian notion of place for that of\nplace as distance. Place as distance is only one of the two notions of\nplace which appear in his commentary. The other, which is related to\nmaterial place, assumes an intrinsic connection between place and the\nlocated body that cannot be founded on distance alone\u201d (Trifogli\n1990a, 350). Giles\u2019 distinction was referred to as an opposition\nbetween material place (the limit of the containing body) and formal\nplace (distance from the fixed points of the universe)\n(Donati-Trifogli 2016). Trifogli also investigated Giles\u2019 notions of\ntime and infinity, emphasizing that his whole approach to natural\nphilosophy is distinguished by a tendency towards a metaphysical\ninterpretation of Aristotelian concepts, as opposed to a physical and\nquantitative one (Trifogli 1990b, 1991). For example, Giles conceives\nof time not as a quantity pertaining to every kind of motion, but\nrather as the same thing as motion, seen under a different aspect. His\nconcept of time rests in fact essentially on a broad notion of\nsuccession, which allows him on one hand to retain the unity of the\nconcept of time, but, on the other hand, to acknowledge the existence\nof different times (Trifogli 1990b, Donati-Trifogli 2016) Giles\ndistinguishes between two kinds of duration: extrinsic duration is the\ntime of celestial motion, and is obviously one in number. Intrinsic\nduration depends on the different motions taking place in the\nsublunary world and is therefore plural (Donati-Trifogli 2016).  A\nsimilar attitude emerges also from the analysis of Giles\u2019 controversy\non angelic time with Henry of Ghent (Porro 1988, Porro 1991, but see\nalso Faes de Mottoni 1983). Both authors thought that the time in\nwhich angels exist, unlike sublunar time, is a discrete succession of\ninstants. Giles and Henry disagreed, however, on the relationship\nexisting between angelic and sublunar time. In particular, Henry\nrejected Giles\u2019 thesis that more instants of angelic time can\ncorrespond to one and the same instant of sublunar time. This\ndifference of opinion rested in part on diverging concepts of angelic\nmotion, which can be istantaneous according to Henry, but not\naccording to Giles.\n",
