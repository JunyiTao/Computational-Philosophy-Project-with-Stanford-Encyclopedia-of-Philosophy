    "main_text": "Philosophical Motivation || The Question of Pluralism\n1.3  The Question of Pluralism\n\nWith these pieces in place we can now begin to sharpen the question\nof pluralism. \n\n As a first step we will restrict our attention to theories which\nare formulated in a common language and our language of choice will be\nthe language of set theory. The reason for restricting to a common\nlanguage is that otherwise there will be theories which are merely\nnotational variants of one another. And the reason for focusing on the\nlanguage of set theory is that it is a universal language in the sense\nthat any system of mathematics is mutually interpretable with a theory\nformulated in the language of set theory; for example, PA is mutually\ninterpretable with ZFC\u2212Infinity. We are thus setting aside the\nquestion of pluralism as it might arise in a more metaphysical setting\nwhere one considers questions such as whether natural numbers are\n\u201creally\u201d sets or whether instead there are two distinct\ndomains of objects\u2014natural numbers and the finite ordinals of\nset theory. Our focus is on the question of pluralism as it arises in\nresponse to the independence phenomenon and the issues at play in this\ndiscussion are invariant across different stances on the above\nmetaphysical question. With regard to our question there is no loss of\ngenerality in the restriction to the language of set theory since the\nproblem of finding new axioms for PA translates (through the natural\ninterpretation of number theory into set theory) into the problem of\nfinding new axioms for ZFC\u2212Infinity, and\nconversely. Nevertheless, in what follows we shall, largely out of\nconvenience and familiarity, continue to speak of theories that are\nformulated in other languages\u2014such as Q and PA\u2014but the\nreader should always understand us to be strictly speaking of the\ncorresponding theory in the language of set theory. \n\n The question of pluralism in its most general formulation is the\nquestion of whether there is a correct path through the hierarchy of\ninterpretability or whether instead a multitude of mutually\nincompatible theories must be admitted as equally legitimate from the\npoint of view of theoretical reason and mathematical truth. There are\nreally two problems that must be addressed. The first is the question\nof how far the hierarchy of interpretability extends, that is, which\ndegrees are non-trivial in that the theories within them are\nconsistent. This is the problem of consistency (or\nnon-triviality). The second is the question of whether, for a\ngiven (non-trivial) degree of interpretability, there are theoretical\nreasons that can be given for one theory over another. This is\nthe problem of selection. If one managed to solve both\nproblems\u2014determining the extent of the non-trivial degrees and\nlocating the correct path through them\u2014then one would have\ncompletely solved the problem of mathematical truth. There are,\nhowever, two important things to stress about this. First, because of\nthe incompleteness theorems, any such solution would have to be\n\u201cschematic\u201d concerning the first part (vertical\nindependence). Second, the solution to the full problem of selection\neven for the degree of ZFC is a very difficult one since it\ninvolves resolving CH and a multitude of other independent statements\nthat arise already at this level. \n\n Because of the difficulty of the second problem it is useful to\nsplit it up into its own hierarchy by classifying statements in terms\nof their complexity. We shall discuss the hierarchy of statement\ncomplexity in more detail in the next section. But for the moment\nsuffice it to say that (roughly speaking) one starts with questions of\nsecond-order arithmetic (stratified according to their complexity) and\nthen one moves on to questions of third-order arithmetic (stratified\naccording to their complexity), and so on. Thus, one first tries to\nsolve the problem of selection at the level of, say, statements of\nsecond-order arithmetic and then one moves on to the problem of\nselection for statements of third-order arithmetic, and so on. The\nquestion of pluralism that we will be addressing is located in the\nhierarchy as follows: It takes a non-skeptical stance toward ZFC and\nseeks axioms that solve the problem of selection for the level of\nsecond-order arithmetic and somewhat\n beyond.[2] \n\n Let us now give some examples of the various\npluralist/non-pluralist positions. At one extreme there is radical\npluralism which maintains that all non-trivial theories in the\ninterpretability hierarchy are on a par and that there are no\ntheoretical reasons that one can give for any theory over\nanother. This form of pluralism is difficult to articulate since, for\nexample, assuming that Q is consistent the theory Q + \u00acCon(Q) is\nconsistent. But it is hard to see how the pluralist can admit this\ntheory as a legitimate candidate since it contains a\nprinciple\u2014namely, \u00acCon(Q)\u2014that is in conflict with the\nbackground assumption that the pluralist employs in arguing that the\ntheory is a legitimate candidate. For this reason most people are\nnon-pluralists about some domains but remain pluralists about\nothers. \n\n The limitative views that we mentioned earlier\u2014strict\nfinitism, finitism, and predicativism\u2014are examples of such\nhybrid views. For example, strict finitists (on one construal) accept\nQ and certain theories that are mutually interpretable with Q, thereby\nadopting non-pluralism for this domain. In addition, the strict\nfinitist takes these theories to exhaust the domain of\nobjective mathematics and adopts a pluralist stance toward the\n remainder.[3] \n In a\nsimilar fashion, finitism and predicativism provide us with examples\nof hybrid non-pluralist/pluralist positions. \n\n Predicativism is of particular interest for our present purposes\nsince it grants the frameworks of the natural numbers but rejects most\nof set theory and, in fact, most of second-order arithmetic. The\npredicativist is a non-pluralist about first-order arithmetic and\nthinks that there is an objective fact of the matter concerning every\nstatement formulated in the language of first-order arithmetic. And\nthe predicativist accepts as much of second-order arithmetic and set\ntheory that can be simulated in a theory such as ATR0 (Arithemetical Transfinite Recursion). But\nthe predicativist remains a pluralist about what lies above. The\npredicativist will often grant that there is utility in employing\naxiomatic systems of set theory but will maintain that the issue of\ntruth does not arise at that level since there is no univocal\nunderlying conception of set. For example, the predicativist will\nthink that there is an objective choice between PA and PA +\n\u00acCon(PA) but not think that there is an objective choice between\nPA2 + PU and PA2 + \u00acPU (where here\nPA2 is (schematic) second-order arithmetic) or between ZFC\nand ZFC + \u201cThere are no strongly inaccessible\ncardinals\u201d. Insofar as the predicativist thinks that the\nindependence results in set theory concerning second-order arithmetic\nare a reason for endorsing pluralism about both ZFC and PA2\nthe non-pluralist case we shall present below is directly engaged with\nthe predicativist. But we should stress that for this discussion we\nshall be presupposing ZFC and so the most direct brand of\nnon-pluralism/pluralism that we shall be engaged with is one that\ntakes a non-pluralist stance toward ZFC but a pluralist stance toward\nstatements like PU which are formally unresolvable on the basis of\nZFC. This is a fairly common view (see, for example, Shelah\n(2003)). \n\nFurther Reading: For more on strict finitism see Nelson\n(1986); for more finitism see Tait (1981); for more on predicativism\nsee Feferman (1964, 2005). \n",
