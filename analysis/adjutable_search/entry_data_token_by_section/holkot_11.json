Propositions in the past tense are necessary\nper accidens: they refer to events that could have been\notherwise before they happened, but that now could not have been other\nthan they were because of the necessity of the past. Propositions in\nthe present tense are hypothetically necessary: they refer to events\nthat could be otherwise, but given that they are what they are, if\nthey are, cannot not be what they are. Propositions in the future\ntense are contingent: they refer to events that are possible to be and\nalso possible not to be. Ockham argued that God\u2019s knowledge of\nevents tracked this modal arrow just as human knowledge of events\ndoes, reintroducing an arrow of \u201ctime\u201d for God as well as\nhuman beings.\n\nIn the ensuing years, Ockham\u2019s modal view of \u201ctime\u201d\nwas joined to a way of speaking about truth traceable to Richard of\nCampsall, an Oxford master of arts and theology teaching in the years\njust before Ockham. Holkot exemplifies this way of thinking.\n\nIn De Interpretatione, chapter 9, Aristotle had bequeathed a\ndifficult problem to the medieval debate about divine foreknowledge.\nHis contention that in order to avoid attaching necessity to all\nevents, propositions about future events were not yet true or false\nseemed either to deny to God the possibility of knowing the future or\nto rule out the contingency of events. Boethius had provided a\nresponse that held until the fourteenth century, but after Scotus\nsubjected his response to a severe critique, new discussion of the\nAristotelian three-valued logic appeared. Campsall distinguished\nbetween propositions about the past and present that were\n\u201cdeterminately true or false\u201d and propositions about the\nfuture that were \u201cindeterminately true or false.\u201d Holkot\nadopted this way of modally dividing up determinations of truth and\nfalsity:\n\n. . . future contingents are said to be propositions about the future\nof which there is no determinate truth or falsity, because although\nthey are true or false, yet those which are true can never have been\ntrue and those which are false can never have been false.\n(Quod. III, q. 1, in Seeing the Future, 63, ll.\n93\u201396)\n\n\nBy the time of Holcot, the analysis of future contingency in terms of\na possible counterfactual past, and the identification of such an\nanalysis with a multi-valued logic, had attained the status of an\nidentifiable tradition. Ockham had not adopted the terminology of\n\u201cindeterminately true or false\u201d and \u201ccontingently\ntrue or false\u201d to speak of the truth status of future contingent\npropositions. He had insisted on a two-valued system in which all\npropositions are determinately true or false. But Holkot departed from\nhim in this. Holkot\u2019s position reflects a view of modality as\nprimary. Necessity and contingency are fundamental, and judgments of\ntruth mean something different in each modal context, rather than\ntruth being primary, and necessity and contingency providing a\ndifferent valence to otherwise true propositions. The efforts to\ngrapple with the implications of contingency had come a long way\n(Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 87\u201394).\n",
