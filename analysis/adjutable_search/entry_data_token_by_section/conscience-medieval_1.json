    "main_text": "Background: The Pagan and Early-Christian Context || St. Paul: Legislative Conscience\n1.2 St. Paul: Legislative Conscience\n\nThe judicial understanding of conscience continued well into the first\ncentury of the Common Era. To be sure, Paul himself continued to\nemploy it. At the same time, D\u2019Arcy credited Paul with\nintroducing, in addition to the \u201cjudicial conscience\u201d, a\nnovel conception he termed the \u201clegislative conscience\u201d.\nIt is not difficult to see why the earlier judicial conception would\nlater take on legislative features. This is because the ability to\njudge past actions as either right or wrong\u2014and to issue\nexhortations on that basis\u2014would, once this property came to be\nassociated with the moral law, take on the legislative role of issuing\ncommands. Indeed, it is in St. Paul that we find this very association\nbetween syneidesis and the moral law:\n\n\n[W]hen Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required\nby the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not\nhave the law. They show that the requirements of the law are written\non their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their\nthoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending\nthem. (Romans 2:14\u201315; NIV)\n\n\nJudging by this passage, there are evidently two expressions of the\nmoral law according to Paul: The Mosaic Law, explicitly handed down to\nthe Jews, and another law that is \u201cwritten on [men\u2019s]\nhearts\u201d. This latter was later glossed as a reference to the\nnatural law, which is accessible to all people, non-Jews included, and\nis consistent with the Mosaic Law. Notice that, according to the\nforegoing passage, conscience (syneidesis) is not the\nultimate source of right and wrong. Rather, the foundation of right\nand wrong is the objective moral law, which is both \u201cwritten on\n[men\u2019s] hearts\u201d and borne witness to by conscience.\n\nOne might say, then, that the objective norm of morality on\nPaul\u2019s account is the moral law (or natural law). Conscience,\nhowever, might be termed morality\u2019s subjective norm. This is\nmade clear in another passage from St. Paul, where he is addressing\nthe question of whether it is permissible for Christians to eat meat\nthat was previously sacrificed to idols. Some, Paul says, erroneously\nthink that to eat such food defiles them. In fact, since the pagan\nidols do not exist, eating food sacrificed to them, or indeed to God\nhimself, is morally irrelevant, since \u201cfood does not bring us\nnear to God\u2014we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if\nwe do\u201d (1 Corinthians 8:8; NIV). Still, even though the\nconsciences of such Christians are erroneous, they must follow them\nsince conscience, Paul suggests, is a rule of conduct (Romans\n14:13\u201323). Eric D\u2019Arcy sums up these two important\ncontributions of St. Paul as follows:\n\n\nSt. Paul, then, introduces an entirely new phase in the history of the\nterm \u201cconscience\u201d in moral theory, and two new features\ncharacterize his use of it. First, it is to play a directive\nrole before action takes place. In the pagan writers,\nconscience did not appear on the scene until after the action\nwas performed, and its role was purely judicial; but in St.\nPaul, conscience is credited with a legislative function, and it\ninduces an obligation in the proper sense. Second, conscience is\nfallible: the directions it issues may be mistaken; but whether it be\nmistaken or not, it seems that we are bound to follow its rulings.\n(D\u2019Arcy 1961: 11\u201312)\n\n\nIn sum, we might follow Sorabji\u2019s suggestion that this phase in\nthe development of the concept of conscience\u2014that is, from its\norigins in fifth-century BCE Greek literature to the first-century\nCE\u2014has eight features (Sorabji 2014: 36).\n\nIt involves a consciousness of the self rather than of\nothers.\nIt draws on values to which one feels personally committed or that\nare \u201cnot necessarily shared by others\u201d.\nIt is self-reflexive insofar as it suggests a \u201csplit\nperson\u201d: an \u201cI\u201d that has secret knowledge which it\nshares with itself.\nIts original purpose was \u201cretrospective\u201d or judicial,\nalthough it later incorporated into its definition a\n\u201cprospective\u201d or legislative function.\nAlthough it draws on general moral principles, it is chiefly\nconcerned with their application to the specific circumstances in\nwhich the agent finds him or herself.\nIt began as a secular concept.\nIn the Christian tradition it is regarded as susceptible to error,\nand\nalthough cognitive in character, it possesses motivating or\naffective power.\n\n",
