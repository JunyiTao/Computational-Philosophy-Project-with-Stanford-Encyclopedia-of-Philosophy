    "main_text": "Aristotle\u2019s Biological Practice || From Inquiry to Understanding; from hoti to dioti.\n6. A Concluding Puzzle\n\nThis entry on Aristotle\u2019s biology and its philosophy closes with\na puzzle about the organization of his biological works when compared\nwith the remainder of the Aristotelian corpus. I began by noting that\nit is a fundamental aspect of Aristotle\u2019s theory of science that\ninvestigation proceeds from a stage where one establishes the\nexistence of the things being studied and the facts about them to a\nstage where the focus is on causal explanations by reference to the\nnatures and essences of those things. It seems clear that the\nbiological works honor this distinction, and do so self-consciously.\nYet Aristotle never suggests, in the Posterior Analytics or\nanywhere else, that these stages should be represented by distinct\ntreatises devoted to the same subject. Indeed, in no other domain\ndoes Aristotle do this: whether we look to meteorology, cosmology,\npsychology, ethics, drama or rhetoric, we find single treatises\npresenting both the facts and their explanation. Nor can this puzzle\nbe easily dismissed as an artifact of later editing\u2014as I have\npointed out a number of times, these treatises have a most interesting\nand consistent pattern of cross-referencing. The treatises that report\nthe results of causal investigations regularly refer to HA\n(and the dissections) for more detail regarding the facts being\nexplained; the HA, in contrast, never refers to the\ncausal treatises. Moreover, the striking avoidance in the Historia\nAnimalium of all of the concepts associated with\ndefinition and explanation cannot reasonably be laid at the feet of\nsome imagined later editor. We are left, then, to ponder what it was\nabout the investigation of animals that led Aristotle to take a\nmethodological distinction regarding stages of investigation\nand reify it in methodologically distinct treatises devoted to these\ndifferent stages.\n",
