    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry focuses on clinical delusions. Although the nature of\ndelusions is controversial, delusions are often characterised as\nunusual beliefs that appear in the context of mental distress. Indeed,\nclinical delusions are a symptom of psychiatric disorders such as\ndementia and schizophrenia, and they also characterize delusional\ndisorders. They can be associated with depression and obsessive\ncompulsive disorder as well. The following case descriptions include\nan instance of erotomania, the delusion that we are loved by a person\nof higher status; an instance of Cotard delusion, the delusion that\nwe are dead or disembodied; and a delusion of persecution, the belief\nthat someone intends to cause us harm.\n\n\nShe realized he was empty without her and was pursuing her, but\nenemies were preventing them from uniting. The enemies included a\nnumber of people: people in her family, her classmates, neighbours and\nmany other persons who were plotting to keep them apart. She knew that\nher conclusions were accurate because he would send messages to her\nproving his love. These messages would often present themselves as the\nlicense plates on cars of a certain state, the color purple and other\nindications that she received from the environment that proved to her\nthat he loved her. (Jordan et al. 2006, p. 787)\n\nShe repeatedly stated that she was dead and was adamant that she had\ndied two weeks prior to the assessment (i.e. around the time of her\nadmission on 19/11/2004). She was extremely distressed and tearful as\nshe related these beliefs, and was very anxious to learn whether or\nnot the hospital she was in, was \u2018heaven\u2019. When asked how\nshe thought she had died, LU replied \u2018I don\u2019t know how.\nNow I know that I had a flu and came here on 19th November. Maybe I\ndied of the flu.\u2019 Interestingly, LU also reported that she felt\n\u2018a bit strange towards my boyfriend. I cannot kiss him, it feels\nstrange \u2013 although I know that he loves me.\u2019 (McKay and\nCipolotti 2007, p. 353)\n\nThe Alien Beings were from outer space, and of all the people in the\nworld, only I was aware of them. The Alien Beings soon took over my\nbody and removed me from it. They took me to a faraway place of\nbeaches and sunlight and placed an Alien in my body to act like me.\n[\u2026] I also saw that the Aliens were starting to take over other\npeople as well, removing them from their bodies and putting Aliens in\ntheir place. Of course, the other people were unaware of what was\nhappening; I was the only person in the world who had the power to\nknow it. At this point I determined that the Aliens were involved in a\nhuge conspiracy against the world (Payne 1992, pp. 726).\n\n\nThe category of delusions is not homogeneous. Some delusions have\nhighly implausible content (as in the case of Cotard delusion). Other highly\nimplausible delusions include mirrored self misidentification (the\ndelusion that the person in the mirror is not our own reflection but a\nstranger), and the Capgras delusion (the delusion that our spouse or\nrelative has been replaced by an impostor). Some other delusions can have\nplausible contents and can even be true. We can\nhave the delusion that we are an uncomprehended genius, that our\nspouse is unfaithful, or that our neighbor is a terrorist, and these\nmay happen to be true beliefs. What makes all the above examples\ninstances of delusion is that they resist counterevidence and are\nnot easily given up in the face of challenges.\n\nTypically, delusions are reported sincerely and with conviction,\nalthough behavior is not always perfectly consistent with the content\nof the delusions and the conviction in the delusional belief can\nfluctuate. Another common feature of delusions is that they threaten\nwellbeing. Experiencing a delusion can be a\nsource of distress, and compromise good functioning. For instance, if\nas a result of a delusion of persecution, we believe that we are followed\nby malevolent others, we may live in a state of great anxiety and fear\nfor our life and the life of our loved ones. The delusion may be the\nreason why we interrupt our studies, give up our job, stop communicating\nwith our family, and so on. That said, some delusions can be meaningful\nand empowering, at least temporarily, and gaining insight into the delusional nature of the belief can cause depression.\n\nThe following first-personal account of delusions illustrates the\npervasive effects that delusions can have on people\u2019s lives:\n\n\nI increasingly heard voices (which I\u2019d always called \u201cloud\nthoughts\u201d or \u201cimpulses with words\u201d) commanding me to\ntake destructive action. I concluded that other people were putting\nthese \u201cloud thoughts\u201d in my head and controlling my\nbehavior in an effort to ruin my life. I smelled blood and decaying\nmatter where no blood or decaying matter could be found (for example,\nin the classrooms at school). I had difficulty concentrating, I\nfantasized excessively, and I had trouble sleeping and eating. (Bockes\n1985, p. 488)\n\n\nThis entry can only address some of the philosophical debates centered\non delusions. Section 1 provides an overview of the philosophical\nsignificance of delusions. Section 2 introduces the issues surrounding\nthe controversial definition of delusions, and explains some of the common\ndistinctions between types of delusions. Section 3\ndiscusses the most prominent theoretical approaches to the nature and\nformation of delusions and the conceptual questions emerging from such\napproaches. Section 4 reviews some of the most discussed themes in the\nphilosophical literature on delusions: whether delusions are\nirrational; whether they are beliefs; and to what extent they overlap\nwith cases of non-clinical beliefs such as self-deception and beliefs\nin conspiracy theories.\n\nThe examination of the issues above culminates in the attempt to\nunderstand what makes delusions pathological, if indeed they are\npathological, and how they differ from other beliefs that are\nconsidered unusual or irrational.\n",
