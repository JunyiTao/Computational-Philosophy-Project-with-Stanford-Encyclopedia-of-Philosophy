Consider a version of the identity theory that\nstates:\n\n(11)\n The proposition that p is true just if it is\nidentical with a\n fact.[12]\n\n\nCandlish\u2019s objection is now that (11)\n\n\ndoes not specify which fact has to be identical with the\nproposition for the proposition to be true. But what the identity\ntheory requires is not that a true proposition be identical with\nsome fact or other, it is that it be identical with the\nright fact. (1999b: 203)\n\n\nIn another paper Candlish puts the matter like this:\n\n\nBut after all, any proposition might be identical with some\nfact or other (and there are reasons identified in the\nTractatus for supposing that all propositions are themselves\nfacts), and so all might be true. What the identity theory needs to\ncapture is the idea that it is by virtue of being identical\nwith the appropriate fact that a proposition is true. (1999a:\n239)\n\n\nThe reference to the Tractatus is suggestive. Of course, it\nmight be objected that the Tractatus does not have\npropositions in the sense of that word figuring here: that is, it does\nnot recognize Russellian propositions (propositions at the level of\nreference). Nor indeed does it appear to recognize Fregean thoughts.\nIn the Tractatus, as we have noted\n (\u00a72),\n declarative sentences (S\u00e4tze) are facts (arrangements\nof names), and states of affairs (Sachlagen,\nSachverhalte, Tatsachen) are also facts\n(arrangements of objects). Even so, Candlish\u2019s allusion to the\nTractatus reminds us that propositions (in our sense)\nare Tractarian inasmuch as they are structured\narrangements of entities, namely objects and properties.\n(Correlatively, thoughts are structured arrangements of senses.) False\npropositions (and false thoughts) will equally be arrangements of\nobjects and properties (respectively, senses). So the difficulty that\nCartwright and Candlish have identified can be put like this.\nPlausibly any proposition, whether or not it is true, is\nidentical with some fact or other given that a proposition is\nan arrangement of entities of the appropriate sort. But if\npropositions just are facts, then every proposition\nis identical with some fact\u2014at the very least, with\nitself\u2014whether it is true or false. So the right-to-left\ndirection of (11) looks incorrect.\n\nJ. C. Beall (2000) attempts to dissolve this problem on the identity\ntheorist\u2019s behalf by invoking the principle of the\nindiscernibility of identicals. His proposal works as follows. If we\nask, in respect of (11), what the \u201cright\u201d fact is, it\nseems that we can answer that the \u201cright\u201d fact must at\nleast have the property of being identical with the proposition\nthat p, and the indiscernibility principle then guarantees\nthat there is only one such fact. This proposal is open to an obvious\nretort. Suppose that the proposition that p is false.\nThat proposition will still be identical with itself, and if we are\nsaying (in Wittgensteinian spirit) that propositions are facts, then\nthat proposition will be identical with at least one fact, namely\nitself. So it will satisfy the right-hand side of (11), its falsity\nnotwithstanding. But reflection on this retort suggests a patch-up to\nBeall\u2019s proposal: why not say that the right fact is\nthe fact that p? We would then be able to gloss (11)\nwith\n\n(12)\n The proposition that p is true just if (a) it is\na fact that p, and (b) the proposition that\np is identical with that fact.\n\n\nFalsity, it seems, now no longer presents a difficulty, because if it\nis false that p then it is not a fact that\np, so that (a) fails, and there is no appropriate\ncandidate for the proposition that p to be identical\n with.[13]\n Notice that, in view of the considerations already aired in\nconnection with the modal problem ((i) of this section), caution is\nhere required. Suppose that it is true that p in the\nactual world, but false in some other possible world. According to the\nstrategy that we have been considering on the identity\ntheorist\u2019s behalf, it would be wrong to say that, in the\npossible world where it is false that p, there is no\nsuch fact as the fact that p. The strategy has it that\nthere is indeed such a fact, because it is (in the actual world) a\nfact that p, and that fact, and the true proposition,\nthat p, go on existing in the possible world where it\nis false that p; it is just that that fact is\nnot a fact in that possible world. But (12), the identity\ntheorist will maintain, deals with this subtlety. In the possible\nworld we are considering, where it is false that p,\nthough the fact that p exists, it is not a fact\nthat p, so (a) fails, and there is accordingly no risk\nof our getting hold of the \u201cwrong\u201d fact. Note also that if\na Wittgensteinian line is adopted, while the (false) proposition that\np will admittedly be identical with a fact\u2014at\nthe very least with itself\u2014it will be possible, given the\nfailure of (a), for the identity theorist to contend with a clear\nconscience that that fact is the wrong fact, which does not\nsuffice to render the proposition true.\n",
