    "main_text": "What is Associationism?\n1. What is Associationism?\nAssociationism is a theory that connects learning to thought based\non principles of the organism\u2019s causal history. Since its early\nroots, associationists have sought to use the history of an\norganism\u2019s experience as the main sculptor of cognitive\narchitecture. In its most basic form, associationism has claimed that\npairs of thoughts become associated based on the organism\u2019s past\nexperience. So, for example, a basic form of associationism (such as\nHume\u2019s) might claim that the frequency with which an organism\nhas come into contact with Xs and Ys in one\u2019s\nenvironment determines the frequency with which thoughts\nabout Xs and thoughts about Ys will arise together\nin the organism\u2019s future.\nAssociationism\u2019s popularity is in part due to how many\ndifferent masters it can serve. In particular, associationism can be\nused as a theory of learning (e.g., as in behaviorist theorizing), a\ntheory of thinking (as in Jamesian \u201cstreams of thought\u201d),\na theory of mental structures (e.g., as in concept pairs), and a theory\nof the implementation of thought (e.g., as in connectionism). All these\ntheories are separable, but share a related, empiricist-friendly\ncore. As used here, a \u201cpure associationist\u201d will refer to\none who holds associationist theories of learning, thinking, mental\nstructure, and implementation. The \u201cpure associationist\u201d\nis a somewhat idealized position, one that no particular theorist may\nhave ever held, but many have approximated to differing degrees (e.g.,\nLocke 1690/1975; Hume 1738/1975; Thorndike 1911; Skinner 1953; Hull\n1943; Churchland 1986, 1989; Churchland and Sejnowski 1990; Smolensky\n1988; Elman 1991; Elman et al. 1996; McClelland et al. 2010; Rydell\nand McConnell 2006; Fazio 2007).\nOutside of these core uses of associationism the movement has also\nbeen closely aligned with a number of different doctrines over the\nyears: empiricism, behaviorism, anti-representationalism (i.e.,\nskepticism about the necessity of representational realism in\npsychological explanation), gradual learning, and domain-general\nlearning. All of these theses are dissociable from core associationist\n thought (see section 7). While one\ncan be an associationist without holding those theses, some of those\ntheses imply associationism to differing degrees. These extra\ntheses\u2019 historical and sociological ties to associationism are\nstrong, and so will be intermittently discussed below.\n",
