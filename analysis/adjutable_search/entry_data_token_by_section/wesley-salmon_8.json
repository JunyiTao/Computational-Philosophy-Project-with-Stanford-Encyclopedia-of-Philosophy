    "main_text": "Explanation and Causality || Beyond the Received View\n5.1 Beyond the Received View\n\nSalmon tackled explanation in a highly original manner which left a\nmost remarkable legacy. He worked intensively on the topic for the\nlast thirty years of his life, refining his approach in response to\ncomments and critiques raised by a number of authors, and shedding new\nlight on various details. At the turn of the Seventies, when Salmon\npublished his groundbreaking paper \u201cStatistical\nExplanation\u201d (Salmon 1970b [1971]) the literature was dominated\nby Hempel\u2019s \u201ccovering law\u201d model of explanation,\nwhich held sway since the Forties, and is often referred to as the\nreceived view. Salmon\u2019s motivation for developing an\nalternative view of explanation stemmed from his dissatisfaction with\ncertain aspects of Hempel\u2019s account. In Four Decades of\nScientific Explanation (Salmon 1990a) Salmon discussed a number\nof counterexamples showing that the requirements Hempel imposed on\nexplanation, and more in particular the requirement of maximal\nspecificity and the requirement of high inductive\nprobability of the explanandum, are neither necessary nor\nsufficient to identify a tenable account of scientific explanation. In\nshort, Salmon\u2019s discontents focused on the impossibility of\nexplaining low probability events, the secondary role assigned to\ncausality, the thesis of the symmetry between explanation and\nprediction, the epistemic relativization of statistical explanation,\nand the insufficient importance ascribed to the notion of\nrelevance.\n\nUnlike Hempel, Salmon did not regard statistical explanation as\nsomewhat incomplete compared to deductive explanation, taken as the\noptimum. By contrast, his approach to explanation takes statistical\ngeneralizations to be the general case, with explanations making use\nof universal generalizations as a special case. A pivotal role is\nassigned to the notion of relevance, more particularly statistical\nrelevance, placed at the core of the Statistical-Relevance\n(or S-R) model. Equal importance is assigned to causality\ninterpreted in a probabilistic fashion. By the Seventies,\nprobabilistic causality had already attracted the attention of a\nnumber of authors including Hans Reichenbach (see Reichenbach 1956);\nbuilding on this work Salmon intended to revive the mechanistic ideal\nof explanation, convinced that the time had come to put the\n\u201ccause\u201d back into \u201cbecause\u201d.\n\nThe notions of statistical relevance and probabilistic\ncausality inform the two components of Salmon\u2019s theory,\nnamely the S-R model, aimed at identifying the network of statistical\nrelations holding between the properties relevant to the events to be\nexplained, and causal explanation, aimed at locating such\nevents within the mechanisms responsible for their occurrence (Salmon\n1984).\n",
