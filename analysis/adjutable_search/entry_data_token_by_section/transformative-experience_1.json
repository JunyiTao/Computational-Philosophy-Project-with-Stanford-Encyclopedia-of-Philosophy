    "main_text": "Varieties of Transformative Experience || Parenthood\n1.1 Parenthood\n\nParenthood is Paul\u2019s paradigm case of transformation (2014,\n2015a). Prior to having a child, one cannot anticipate what it will be\nlike to become a parent. Further, having a child changes the parent in\na personally transformative way. Core preferences and life goals are\noften reshaped around a new priority: the child. The way the new\nparent sees the world and perceives terror and joy shifts. Zadie Smith\n(2013 [2018]) eloquently puts the previously unknown complexity of\nhaving a child thusly:\n\n\nOccasionally the child, too, is a pleasure, though mostly she is a\njoy, which means in fact she gives us not much pleasure at all but\nrather that strange admixture of terror, pain, and delight that I have\ncome to recognize as joy and now must find some way to live with\ndaily. This is a new problem. (Smith 2013 [2018, 331])\n\n\nAnd of course, the transformation associated with parenthood is not\nrestricted to one\u2019s first biological child. It extends to\nadopted children, and even can extend beyond humans to feline, canine,\nand other beings who depend on us and with whom we can bond.\n",
