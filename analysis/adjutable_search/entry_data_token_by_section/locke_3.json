It is worth noting that\nthe Two Treatises and the Letter Concerning\nToleration were published anonymously. Locke took up residence in\nthe country at Oates in Essex, the home of Sir Francis and Lady Masham\n(Damaris Cudworth). Locke had met Damaris Cudworth in 1682 and became\ninvolved intellectually and romantically with her. She was the\ndaughter of Ralph Cudworth, the Cambridge Platonist, and a philosopher\nin her own right. After Locke went into exile in Holland in 1683, she\nmarried Sir Francis Masham. Locke and Lady Masham remained good\nfriends and intellectual companions to the end of Locke\u2019s life.\nDuring the remaining years of his life, Locke oversaw four more\neditions of the Essay and engaged in controversies over the\nEssay most notably in a series of published letters with\nEdward Stillingfleet, Bishop of Worcester. In a similar way, Locke\ndefended the Letter Concerning Toleration against a series of\nattacks. He wrote The Reasonableness of Christianity and\nSome Thoughts on Education during this period as well.\n\nNor was Locke finished with public affairs. In 1696 the Board of Trade\nwas revived. Locke played an important part in its revival and served\nas the most influential member on it until 1700. The new Board of\nTrade had administrative powers and was, in fact, concerned with a\nwide range of issues, from the Irish wool trade and the suppression of\npiracy, to the treatment of the poor in England and the governance of\nthe colonies. It was, in Peter Laslett\u2019s phrase \u201cthe body\nwhich administered the United States before the American\nRevolution\u201d (Laslett 1954 [1990: 127]). During these last eight\nyears of his life, Locke was asthmatic, and he suffered so much from\nit that he could only bear the smoke of London during the four warmer\nmonths of the year. Locke plainly engaged in the activities of the\nBoard out of a strong sense of patriotic duty. After his retirement\nfrom the Board of Trade in 1700, Locke remained in retirement at Oates\nuntil his death on Sunday 28 October 1704.\n",
