    "main_text": "Early Modern Period || The Primacy of Melody: Rousseau\n3.6 Music between Form and Content: Kant\n\nWhile his comments on music are at times disparaged as lacking\nartistic sensitivity, Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) is arguably the\nfirst major modern philosopher to discuss instrumental music in the\ncontext of a systematic account of the arts. His influence on\nsubsequent musical thinking, and particularly on the formalist strand,\nis undeniable (see the entry on\n history of western philosophy of music: since 1800, section 1.6),\n but more controversial is whether he himself defends a variety of\nformalism. Kant\u2019s main discussion of music is contained in the\nfirst section of the Critique of the Power of Judgment\n(1790), but some remarks are also found in his Anthropology from a\nPragmatic Point of View (1798).\n\nKant\u2019s views on music follow from an account of beauty that must\nbe briefly reconstructed. Kant contrasts the beautiful, which\naspires to universality, with the agreeable, which is\nsubjective and idiosyncratic. According to Kant, when we ascribe\nbeauty to objects we are making judgments of taste. These are\nsubjective judgments, and include a feeling of pleasure. In this\nsense, judgments of taste are quite like judgments of agreeableness.\nThe beautiful, however, is different from the agreeable in that it\nrequires disinterested pleasure (interessenloses\nWohlgefallen), that is, pleasure that does not presuppose the\nexistence of its object. For example, I may find beautiful an imagined\ntune or painting, but I can\u2019t find a refreshing drink agreeable\nif I merely think about it (Kant 1790: \u00a72).\n\nAs they do not depend on concepts, and essentially include a\nsubjective element of pleasure, judgments of taste are non-cognitive,\nand cannot therefore aspire to the same general validity as, say,\nmathematical proofs. However, judgments of taste are universal. When\none judges an object to be beautiful, one is also at the same time\nasserting that anyone ought to find it beautiful (Kant 1790:\n\u00a76\u20137). This again stands in contrast with the agreeable.\nWhen I judge the taste of calvados to be pleasant, I am not requiring\ngeneral assent; in contrast, the pleasure associated with a work of\nmusic is one I expect anyone to feel\u2014it is a beautiful piece of\nmusic.\n\nThe non-conceptual universality of judgments of taste is grounded in\nwhat Kant calls \u201cthe free play of the imagination and the\nunderstanding\u201d (Kant 1790: \u00a79). Ordinary perceptual and\ncognitive activities require the cooperation of imagination and\nunderstanding (here it is important to keep in mind that Kant\nconsiders imagination to be involved in perception) but in these cases\nimagination is guided by concepts. In the free play required by\njudgments of taste, imagination and understanding interact\nunconstrained by concepts, but in a way that is common to all human\nbeings (Kant 1790: \u00a720 ff.).\n\nKant distinguishes between agreeable and beautiful arts. While both\ninvolve pleasure, agreeable arts merely aim at arousing enjoyment,\nwhereas beautiful arts involve cognition (Kant 1790: \u00a744). The\napparent ambiguity in Kant\u2019s remarks on music runs so deep that\nhe may seem to contradict himself even on the status of music as a\nbeautiful art. He lists Tafelmusik (light music composed to\nbe a background accompaniment to dining) alongside the art of telling\namusing stories and jokes as an example of agreeable art, and adds\nthat this kind of music is supposed to encourage conversation\n\u201cwithout anyone paying the least attention to its\ncomposition\u201d (Kant 1790: \u00a744). In the \u201cRemark\u201d\nthat concludes the first section of the Critique, Kant once\nmore lists music alongside the joke as an agreeable art. However,\nelsewhere in the same work Kant clearly counts music a beautiful art,\nranking it alongside poetry and painting (\u00a744, 191). More\nimportantly, Kant discusses music in \u00a751, where he introduces his\ndivision of the beautiful arts. Samantha Matherne (2014:\n135\u2013138) has argued that Kant\u2019s apparent hesitation is\nactually grounded in a different attitude we may take to music. If we\nattend to the bodily effect of the piece, music will be merely\nagreeable, whereas a focus on the formal structure of the work will\nmake possible a judgment of taste, and thus music may be found\nbeautiful.\n\nA final point on musical beauty is worthy of mention. Kant\ndistinguishes between free and adherent (anh\u00e4ngend)\nbeauty. Adherent beauty presupposes a concept of the object\u2019s\npurpose. Thus, a work of architecture is judged beautiful or not\naccording to its success or otherwise in housing people, institutions,\nor businesses. The resulting judgment of taste is characterized by\nKant as impure. Free beauty does not presuppose any concept. As\nexamples of free beauty, Kant mentions abstract patterns, and\ninstrumental music, \u201cindeed all music without a text\u201d\n(Kant 1790: \u00a716). In general, when Kant discusses music he has\npure instrumental music in mind. If one considers that previous\nthinkers devoted almost exclusive attention to vocal music, this is a\nsignificant shift in focus, and one that will be confirmed by the\nphilosophy of music following Kant.\n\nA further ambiguity is represented by Kant\u2019s apparent commitment\nboth to a variety of musical formalism, according to which musical\nbeauty uniquely resides in the relationship between its component\nparts, and to the idea that music is expressive of emotions. This is a\nmanifestation of a general tension in Kant\u2019s aesthetics (see\nGuyer 1977). A formalist tendency is evident when Kant claims that the\nproper object of the pure judgment of taste in music is composition,\nby which he means the arrangement of tones (Kant 1790: \u00a714).\nLater on, Kant states that music \u201cmerely plays with\nsensations\u201d (Kant 1790: \u00a753), offering this in support of\nhis claims regarding music\u2019s low rank among the arts.\n\nDespite these apparent professions of formalism, Kant also stresses\nmusic\u2019s connection to the sphere of emotions. Particularly, he\nseems to accept a version of the Affektenlehre, according to\nwhich works of music may arouse specific emotions in the listener. In\n\u00a753, Kant affirms that music may convey an emotion because of its\nanalogy with the tone of voice typical of impassioned speech (see also\nKant 1798: \u00a718).\n\nIn the face of these textual ambiguities, an option is to adopt a\nformalist interpretation and hold that Kant was merely paying lip\nservice to the Affektenlehre (Kivy 2009: 50 ff.; Schueller\n1955: 224\u201325). However, other scholars deny that Kant was a\nformalist. Young (2020) attributes to him an imitation theory of\nexpressiveness: music imitates the tones characteristic of impassioned\nspeech. Matherne (2014) attempts to reconcile formalist and\nexpressivist elements in Kant\u2019s thought. Crucial to her\ninterpretation is the concept of an aesthetic idea, which Kant defines\nas\n\n\nthat representation of the imagination that occasions much thinking\nthough without it being possible for any determinate thought, i.e.,\nconcept, to be adequate to it. (Kant 1790: \u00a749)\n\n\nAesthetic ideas are imaginative representations that cannot be\nexhausted by any given concept\u2014think of an abstract painting and\nof the multitude of things it could look like or symbolize. Aesthetic\nideas are crucially involved in our experience of the beautiful, and\nKant goes as far as to define beauty as the expression of aesthetic\nideas (Kant 1790: \u00a751). In his discussion of music, Kant states\nthat the form of a composition\u2014he explicitly mentions\n\u201charmony and melody\u201d\u2014expresses\n\n\nthe aesthetic ideas of a coherent whole of an unutterable fullness of\nthought, corresponding to a certain theme, which constitutes the\ndominant affect in the piece. (Kant 1790: \u00a753)\n\n\nHere the expression of a piece\u2019s overarching emotional\ncharacter, a central concern for the Affektenlehre, is\nexplicitly linked to the piece\u2019s formal structure. Matherne\n(2014: 134) concludes that Kant is defending what she terms\n\u201cexpressive formalism\u201d, a view according to which music is\nable to express aesthetic ideas pertaining to the realm of emotions,\nand does so by means of its formal structure.\n\nKant\u2019s view of music\u2019s relative value as an art has also\nbeen an object of critical attention (Weatherston 1996; Parret 1998).\nKant ranks the arts according to two distinct criteria. When it comes\nto \u201ccharm and movement of the mind\u201d (Kant 1790: \u00a753),\nmusic is first among all of the arts, as it arouses emotions more\ndeeply than any other art form. It is clear that Kant does not\nconsider this criterion particularly important to artistic value.\nAdditionally, music occupies the bottom of the hierarchy when one\nranks the arts according to the second criterion, that is, \u201cin\nterms of the culture that they provide for the mind\u201d (Kant 1790:\n\u00a753). To provide culture for the mind is described by Kant as to\ncontribute to the enlargement of the faculties of imagination and\nunderstanding\u2014think again of an abstract painting, and how it\nmay enrich our capacity to give visible form to some ideas.\n\nWhile they may raise various difficult interpretive issues,\nKant\u2019s views on music have more than a purely historical\ninterest. Some contemporary commentators and philosophers of music\nhave suggested that they might be brought to bear on current debates\n(see Bicknell 2002; Ginsborg 2011: 337; Matherne 2014:\n139\u2013140).\n\nRegardless of whether Kant\u2019s formalism is or not a nineteenth\ncentury construction, his awareness of music\u2019s purely formal\naspect signals a change in Western philosophy of music. Vocal music is\nno longer the center of theoretical speculation. The philosophical\nproblems that music poses are first and foremost those posed by pure\ninstrumental music, and it is its nature that must be clarified if one\nis to understand music\u2019s relation to language, concepts, and\nemotions.\n",
