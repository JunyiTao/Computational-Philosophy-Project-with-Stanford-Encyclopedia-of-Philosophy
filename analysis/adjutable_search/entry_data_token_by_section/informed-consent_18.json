    "main_text": "Voluntary consent || \u201cNo choice\u201d situations\n5.3 \u201cNo choice\u201d situations\n\nIn some areas of practical ethics, the lack of decent alternatives to\naccepting a bad offer, a so-called \u201cNo choice\u201d situation\n(Wertheimer 1987, e.g., p. 13), is said to make us forced or compelled\nto choose the offer (Cohen 1979), or to undermine voluntariness\notherwise. While in such cases, indecent alternatives remain in\nprinciple open to us\u2014the offer is not physically imposed on\nus\u2014the same could be said of most literal coercion. In\n\u201cyour money or your life\u201d situations, the option of dying\nremains open in principle. Consider then a poor person who knows that\nhis only way to gain access to an expensive life-saving drug is to\nparticipate in a risky or very unpleasant study where the drug is\nprovided free of charge. He is not, strictly speaking, coerced\n(Hawkins 2008, 24\u20135), but some believe that his consent is\ninvoluntary and the trial is unethical. None of the options available\nto him are decent.\n\nThere is a problem with this claim. Its logic suggests that whenever a\nsick, rich person has no decent alternative to taking a badly\nunpleasant life-saving drug, there is no voluntary consent, and drug\ndelivery is illegitimate. Even when the nasty side effects remain far\nbetter for her than her only alternative\u2014to die of the\ndisease\u2014she is not providing voluntary consent to take the drug,\nand it is unethical to give it to her. Since the latter reasoning is\nsurely flawed, the former reasoning may be flawed as well.\n\nSome have responded that the poor man\u2019s inability to give\nvoluntary consent to trial participation stems from injustice, not\nnatural disease, and that this makes a big difference. But surely\nmedical aid that saves consenting victims from the horrible results of\ninjustice and carries unpleasant side effects can remain\nfully permissible. For example, following the 2010 earthquake in\nHaiti, it was fully permissible for the U.S. military and its\nphysicians to perform consensual life-saving leg amputations. It was\npermissible whether earthquake injuries were purely natural, partly\nthe result of non-U.S. injustice (local contractors\u2019 independent\nneglect of safety rules), or partly the result of U.S.-perpetrated\ninjustice (long-standing U.S. meddling in Haitian politics at the\nexpense of accountability, including accountability for neglectful\nconstruction projects).\n\nAnother way out is to say that consent is insufficiently voluntary\nwhen the patient\u2019s options are unfairly curtailed by the offer\nitself (Miller and Wertheimer 2010, 92, 97). \u201cYour money or your\nlife\u201d offers diminish our options, and that is why these offers\ncompromise our voluntariness. By contrast, the above-mentioned offers\nto the poor trial candidate and to the rich patient do not curtail\noptions and they maintain voluntariness. However, imagine impoverished\npotential study participants who lack alternative ways to obtain\nlife-saving drugs. Imagine further that the investigators offer them\nthese drugs whether or not they consent to participate, free of\ncharge. The intuition is that this free, unconditional offer increases\nthe voluntariness of these potential participants\u2019 decisions on\nwhether to participate, and it makes their invitation to participate\nin the trial easier to defend ethically. The free offer keeps their\noptions open and thereby, commonsense suggests, renders their consent\nmore genuinely voluntary. Note, however, that the options that the\noffer opens for them are not ones that the invitation to\nparticipate would otherwise have curtailed.\n",
