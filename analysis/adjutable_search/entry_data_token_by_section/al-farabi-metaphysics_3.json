    "main_text": "F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s ontology: the Book of Letters and On the One and Unity || F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s project in the Book of Letters\n3.1 F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s project in the Book of Letters\n\nThe most basic questions about the Book of Letters are what,\nif anything, the treatise is about overall, and how the different\nparts of the treatise contribute to knowledge of that aim. Mahdi 1969a\ndivides the text into three \u201cParts\u201d\n[abw\u00e2b]; in the manuscripts that have been studied so\nfar, the three Parts are probably not transmitted in the right order,\nsome parts of the text and perhaps in particular an introduction are\nmissing, and it is not obvious what the subject-matters of the three\nParts have to do with each other. The title Kit\u00e2b\nal-\u1e25ur\u00fbf = Book of Letters is the same title\nby which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in On the Aims cites\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (which presumably gets called\nBook of Letters because Arabic authors cite its individual\nbooks by the names of letters of the alphabet, just as we do now), so\nthe title suggests that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee intends this treatise\nto correspond to the Metaphysics; and there are heavy\noverlaps of content between the Book of Letters and\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, especially but not exclusively\nBook V, which make it very unlikely that the correspondence of titles\nis a coincidence. But the title Kit\u00e2b\nal-\u1e24ur\u00fbf can also mean something else, since\n\u201c\u1e25ur\u00fbf\u201d (sg. \u1e25arf),\nbesides meaning \u201cletters\u201d, can also mean grammatical\n\u201cparticles\u201d, i.e., any words that can neither be declined\nlike a noun nor conjugated like a verb, so pronouns and articles and\nprepositions and adverbs and\n conjunctions.[16]\n Parts I and III of the Book of Letters are organized\n\u201clexically\u201d (like F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s On\nIntelligence), around the many meanings of each of a series of\nterms, and the majority of the terms here are grammatically particles\nrather than nouns or verbs: once again, it seems very unlikely that\nthis is a coincidence. But how can the same book be Kit\u00e2b\nal-\u1e24ur\u00fbf both in the sense of filling the role of\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, and in the sense of being\nabout grammatical particles? And how would a study of the meanings of\nparticles (and of some selected nouns) contribute to metaphysics as\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has described it in On the Aims? To\nsee how this could work, we have to see something about the projects\nof the three Parts of the Book of Letters and how they fit\ntogether; and we have to start with Part II, which\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee probably intended to come first, and which\ncan be taken as programmatic for the whole treatise. After discussing\nthe project of the treatise, we will focus on its most remarkable\nclaims about the different senses of being [mawj\u00fbd] and\nthe corresponding senses of existence [wuj\u00fbd], and\nabout how they should be investigated, and the implications for\nmetaphysics. Finally, we will look more briefly at the corresponding\nclaims about one and unity in On the One and Unity.\n\nPart II of the Book of Letters gives an account of the\ndevelopment of the \u201csyllogistic arts\u201d (arts of reasoning\nsuch as rhetoric, dialectic and sophistic), culminating in\ndemonstrative science, within a given linguistic and religious\ncommunity, and their transmission from one community to another.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is especially interested in the\nlanguage of these arts, especially of demonstrative science.\nHe talks about the origin of language as such; but language as it\nnaturally arises is not well suited to being the vehicle of\ndemonstrative science, because it is chiefly devoted to naming and\ndescribing the objects of immediate practical interest to human\nbeings, which are not the main objects of theoretical interest. But\nnatural language can be extended in two main ways to provide the\nterminology of the syllogistic arts. First, terms of ordinary language\ncan be extended metaphorically to new meanings, and can then be frozen\nfor use as technical terms; and this process of metaphorical extension\nand freezing can be repeated indefinitely many times. Second, new\nterms can be formed from old ones by regular grammatical processes of\nmorphological derivation, and this type of extension too can be\nrepeated and combined with the first type. Special problems, however,\narise when the arts, especially demonstrative science, are transmitted\nfrom one community to another, and the translators must create a new\ntechnical vocabulary in the target-language. If the technical terms of\nthe source-text were derived by freezing metaphorically extended words\nin the source-language, the translator may try to create new technical\nterms either by imitating the metaphors of the source-language in the\ntarget-language, where they may be much less natural, or else by\nforming new terms from metaphors more natural to the target language:\neither way, there is a risk of misunderstanding.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee talks about these problems in general, but he\ndevotes special attention to the transmission of demonstrative\nphilosophy and its vocabulary from Greek into (Syriac and thus)\nArabic.\n\nAlthough F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not make explicit connections\nbetween the different Parts of the Book of Letters, Part II\ncan be seen as giving an implicit program for Parts I and III, each of\nwhich is organized lexically around a list of terms: in each case\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee lists the different meanings of the term,\nstarting with an ordinary-language meaning and then explaining how it\nis metaphorically extended to a series of further meanings, including\ntechnical meanings in the different arts and especially in philosophy.\nPart I treats in this way terms including the names of many of the ten\nAristotelian categories, or the interrogative particles from which\nnames of categories are derived (\u201ckamiyya\u201d =\nquantity is derived from \u201ckam?\u201d = \u201chow\nmuch?\u201d, and so on); it also discusses particles such as\n\u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cbecause\u201d and nouns such as\n\u201cbeing\u201d, \u201cessence\u201d, and\n\u201caccident\u201d, with a heavy overlap with the list of terms\ninvestigated in Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics V. Part Three\napplies the same lexical method to the four kinds of scientific\nquestion or investigation described in Posterior Analytics\nII, the questions \u201cwhether X is\u201d, \u201cwhat\nX is\u201d, \u201cthat S is P\u201d, and\n\u201cwhy S is P\u201d. In each of these cases\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee distinguishes the ways of investigating these\nquestions in different disciplines\u2014for instance, how they are\ninvestigated in dialectic vs. how they are investigated in\ndemonstrative science\u2014as if they turned on different meanings\nthat the particles, \u201cwhether\u201d or \u201cwhat\u201d or\n\u201cthat\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d, have in different syllogistic\narts. There are clear connections between Parts I and III, notably\nbetween Part I on the senses of \u201cbeing\u201d\n[mawj\u00fbd] and Part III on the senses of \u201cwhether\nit is\u201d [hal mawj\u00fbd]. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nevidently thinks that people have gone wrong in the sciences through\nconfusing different meanings of the terms he discusses, in particular\nthrough confusing ordinary-language meanings of these terms with\ntechnical meanings in the syllogistic arts, or confusing meanings in\none syllogistic art with meanings in another. And he thinks these\nproblems are made worse when the technical terms of these arts are\nfirst developed in one language (Greek) and then translated into\nanother (Arabic) in the ways he has described in Part II: if a word\nwhich has a meaning in ordinary Arabic (or in the technical vocabulary\nof some native Arabic art), or a word morphologically derived from\nsuch an Arabic word, has its meaning extended to serve as the\nartificial Arabic equivalent of some Greek technical term, then there\nis a serious risk that it will be misunderstood by Arabic readers.\nThis explains why F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that the sort of\nwork Aristotle does in Metaphysics V, distinguishing\ndifferent meanings of a series of technical terms, would be even more\nnecessary in Arabic than it was in Greek.\n",
