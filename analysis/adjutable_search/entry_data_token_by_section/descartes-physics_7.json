In\nfact, returning to the Cartesian laws of nature (section 4), it is\nevident that Descartes has allotted a fundamental role to the action\nof bodily \u201cforces\u201d or \u201ctendencies\u201d: for\nexample, the tendency of bodies to follow straight lines, the\nresistance to motion of a large resting body (to a smaller moving\nbody), etc. In The World, he states: \u201cthe virtue or\npower in a body to move itself can well pass wholly or partially to\nanother body and thus no longer be in the first; but it cannot no\nlonger exist in the world\u201d (AT XI 15). As an early remark\nconcerning his conservation principle, this explanation seems to\nenvision force much like a property or \u201cpower\u201d possessed\nby individual material objects, similar to the qualitative,\nmetaphysical properties of the Scholastics (as in the\n\u201cimpetus\u201d theory). For these reasons, the nature of bodily\nforces or tendencies is a philosophical question of much interest in\nthe study of Descartes\u2019 physics.\n\nIn order to better grasp the specific role of Cartesian force, it\nwould be useful to closely examine his theory of centrifugal effects,\nwhich is closely associated with the second law of nature. Besides\nstraight-line motion, Descartes\u2019 second law also mentions the\n\u201ccenter-fleeing\u201d (centrifugal) tendencies of circularly\nmoving material bodies: \u201call movement is, of itself, along\nstraight lines; and consequently, bodies which are moving in a circle\nalways tends to move away from the center of the circle which they are\ndescribing\u201d (Pr II 39). At first glance, the second law might\nseem to correspond to the modern scientific dissection of centrifugal\nforce: specifically, the centrifugal effects experienced by a body\nmoving in a circular path, such as a stone in a sling, are a normal\nconsequence of the body\u2019s tendency to depart the circle along a\nstraight tangential path. Yet, as stated in his second law, Descartes\ncontends (wrongly) that the body tends to follow a straight line away\nfrom the center of its circular trajectory. That is, the force exerted\nby the rotating stone, as manifest in the outward \u201cpull\u201d\non the impeding sling, is a result of a striving towards straight line\ninertial motion directed radially outward from the center of the\ncircle, rather than a striving towards straight line motion aimed\nalong the circle\u2019s tangent. Descartes does acknowledge, however,\nthe significance of tangential motion in explicating such\n\u201ccenter-fleeing\u201d tendencies, but he relegates this\nphenomenon to the subordinate status of a composite effect. By his\nreckoning, the tendency to follow a tangential path exhibited by a\ncircling body, such as the flight of the stone upon release from the\nsling, can be constructed from two more basic or primary inclinations:\nfirst, the tendency of the object to continue along its circular path;\nand second, the tendency of the object to travel along the radial line\naway from the center. Thus, Descartes is willing to admit that\n\u201cthere can be strivings toward diverse movements in the same\nbody at the same time\u201d (Pr III 57), a judgment that seems to\npresuppose the acceptance of some type of \u201ccompositional\u201d\ntheory of tendencies analogous to his dissection of determinations.\nYet, since he believes that \u201cthe sling, \u2026, does not\nimpede the striving [of the body along the circular path]\u201d (Pr\nIII 57), he eventually places sole responsibility for the production\nof the centrifugal force effects on the radially directed component of\n\u201cstriving\u201d. He states, \u201cIf instead of considering\nall the forces of [a body\u2019s] motion, we pay attention, to only\none part of it, the effect of which is hindered by the\nsling;\u2026;we shall say that the stone, when at point A,\nstrives only [to move] toward D, or that it only attempts to\nrecede from the center E along the straight line\nEAD\u201d (Pr III 57; see Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Diagram that accompanies Pr\nIII 57.\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 use of the terms \u201ctendency\u201d and\n\u201cstriving\u201d in his rotating sling example should not be\nequated with his previous concept of a determination of motion. A\ndetermination is confined to a body\u2019s actual motion, whereas a\nbody\u2019s tendency towards motion only occurs at a single instant.\nHe states: \u201cOf course, no movement is accomplished in an\ninstant; yet it is obvious that every moving body, at any given moment\nin the course of its movement, is inclined to continue that movement\nin some direction in a straight line,\u2026\u201d (Pr II 39). In\nanother passage in the Principles, Descartes identifies these\nstrivings as a \u201cfirst preparation for motion\u201d (Pr III 63).\nHence, while determinations necessitate a span of several instants,\ntendencies towards motion are manifest only at single instants. This\nis a crucial distinction, for it partitions Cartesian dynamics into\ntwo ontological camps: forces that exist at moments of time, and\nmotions that can only subsist over the course of several temporal\nmoments. In many parts of the Principles, moreover, Descartes\nsuggests that quantity of motion is the measure of these bodily\ntendencies, and thus quantity of motion has a dual role as the measure\nof non-instantaneous bodily motion as well as the instantaneous bodily\ntendencies (see Pr III 121).\n\nGiven his rejection of the Scholastic qualitative tradition in\nphysics, Descartes\u2019 depiction of centrifugal effects as due to a\n\u201ctendency\u201d or \u201cstriving\u201d of moving bodies thus\nraises a host of intriguing ontological questions (and may even reveal\na vestigial influence of his earlier Scholastic training). That is,\neven as his penchant for a geometrical world view increased, as\nmanifest in the identification of extension as matter\u2019s primary\nquality, Descartes continued to treat inertial motion and its\naccompanying force effects as if they were essential characteristics\nof bodies. Descartes\u2019 own remarks on the ontological status of\ninertial force, furthermore, disclose a certain degree of ambiguity\nand indecision. In a 1638 letter, (six years before the\nPrinciples), he concludes:\n\nI do not recognize any inertia or natural sluggishness in\nbodies\u2026; and I think that by simply walking, a man makes the\nentire mass of the earth move ever so slightly, since he is putting\nhis weight now on one spot, now on another. All the same, I agree\n\u2026that when the largest bodies (such as the largest ships) are\npushed by a given force (such as a wind), they always move more slowly\nthan others. (AT II 467)\n\n\nIn this passage, Descartes seems to deny the existence of inertial\nforce if conceived as a form of Scholastic quality that material\nbodies can possess; rather, bodies are \u201cindifferent to\nmotion\u201d, so even the slightest weight should move the entire\nearth. On the other hand, he is willing to acknowledge the commonly\nobserved fact that larger objects are much harder to set in motion\nthan smaller objects. Consequently, although Descartes finds the\nexistence of \u201cforces of resistance\u201d (or \u201cnatural\nsluggishness\u201d) problematic, as is the case with such similar\nproperties as weight, he does not entirely relegate inertia to the\nphenomenological status of the so-called secondary properties of\nmatter (such as color, taste, etc., which only exist in the mind). The\nmain reason for this inclusion of inertial force effects into\nscientific discourse can probably be traced to Descartes\u2019\nclassification of motion as an intrinsic characteristic or\n\u201cmode\u201d of extension (see\n Section 3).\n As the concluding sections of the Principles state: \u201cI\nhave now demonstrated [there] are nothing in the [material] objects\nother than\u2026certain dispositions of size, figure and\nmotion\u2026\u201d (Pr IV 200). Since inertial forces are a\nconsequence or a by-product of motion, as the product of the size\ntimes speed of bodies, Descartes apparently did not object to\nincorporating these phenomena within the discussion of the modes of\nmaterial substance.\n\nYet, even if Descartes described force as an intrinsic fact of\nmaterial interactions, the exact nature of the relationship between\nforce and matter remains rather unclear. In particular, is force a\nproperty actually contained or present within bodies? Or, is it some\nsort of derivative phenomenal effect of the action of speed and size,\nand thus not present within extension? On the former interpretation\n(as favored by Alan Gabbey 1980, and Martial Gueroult 1980), forces\nexist in bodies in at least one important sense as \u201creal\u201d\nproperties or modes whose presence occasions the Cartesian laws of\nnature. While many of Descartes\u2019 explanations might seem to\nfavor this interpretation (e.g., \u201c[a body] at rest has force to\nremain at rest\u201d, Pr II 43), Daniel Garber charges that such\nviews run counter to Descartes\u2019 demand that extension alone\ncomprise the essence of matter. Garber suggests that we view Cartesian\nforce as a sort of shorthand description of the dynamical regularities\nmaintained in the world by God, and not as some form of quality\ninternal to bodies: \u201cThe forces that enter into the discussion\n[of the Cartesian collision laws] can be regarded simply as ways of\ntalking about how God acts, resulting in the law-like behavior of\nbodies; force for proceeding and force of resisting are ways of\ntalking about how, \u2026, God balances the persistence of the state\nof one body with that of another\u201d (Garber 1992a, 298; see also\nHatfield 1979, Des Chene 1996, and Manchak 2009, for more approaches).\nIn various passages associated with the conservation principle,\nGarber\u2019s interpretation apparently gains credibility. For\ninstance: \u201cSo in now maintaining the world by the same action\nand with the same laws with which He [God] created it, He conserves\nmotion; not always contained in the same parts of matter, but\ntransferred from some parts to others depending on the ways in which\nthey come in contact\u201d (Pr II 42). In retrospect, however, it\nmust be acknowledged that Descartes\u2019 classification of material\nsubstance with extension, as exemplified in his demand that there\nexists nothing in bodies except \u201ccertain dispositions of size,\nfigure and motion\u201d, is so open-ended and equivocal as to easily\naccommodate both of the interpretations surveyed above. All that can\nbe safely concluded is that Descartes envisioned the forces linked\nwith bodily inertial states as basic, possibly primitive, facts of the\nexistence of material bodies\u2014a broad judgment that, by refusing\nto take sides, opts out of this difficult ontological dispute.\n",
