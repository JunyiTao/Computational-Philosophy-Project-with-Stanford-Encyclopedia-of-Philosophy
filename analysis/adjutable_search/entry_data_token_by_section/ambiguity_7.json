    "main_text": "Types of Ambiguity || Lexical Ambiguity\n3.1 Lexical Ambiguity\n\nThe lexicon contains entries that are homophonous, or even co-spelled,\nbut differ in meanings and even syntactic categories.\n\u2018Duck\u2019 is both a verb and a noun as is\n\u2018cover\u2019. \u2018Bat\u2019 is a noun with two different\nmeanings and a verb with at least one meaning. \u2018Kick the\nbucket\u2019 is arguably ambiguous between one meaning involving\ndying and one meaning involving application of foot to bucket.\n\nThis sort of ambiguity is often very easy to detect by simple\nlinguistic reflection, especially when the meanings are wildly\ndistinct such as in the case of \u2018bat\u2019. It can be more\ndifficult, however, when the meanings are closely related. A classic\ncase is the short word \u2018in\u2019. The meaning(s) of\n\u2018in\u2019, if it is ambiguous, seem to crucially involve a\ngeneral notion of containment, but at a more fine-grained level, the\ntypes of containment can seem wildly distinct. One can be in therapy,\nin Florida, in the Mafia, in the yearbook\u2026but it seems like a\njoke to say that one is in therapy and the Mafia. \n\nThe considerations suggest that \u2018in\u2019 is ambiguous, but\nperhaps it is univocal with a very sense general meaning that involves\ncontainment of an appropriate sort and different objects require\ndifferent sorts of appropriate containment. Telling between these two\npossibilities is difficult. An even harder case of lexical ambiguity\ninvolves the putative ambiguity in \u2018any\u2019 between the\nreading as a universal quantifier and a \u2018free choice\u2019\nitem. (see Dayal 2004)\n\nA few points about lexical ambiguity should be kept in mind, so\nI\u2019ll repeat them. First, a bookkeeping issue: should we relegate\nlexical ambiguity to the lexicon (two non-identical entries for\nambiguous terms) or to semantic interpretation (one lexical entry, two\nor more meanings)? We\u2019ll go with the first option (so the two meanings\nof \u2018bank\u2019 correspond to two separate lexical items) but\nnothing I know of forces this choice. Second, the word/lexical item\ndistinction may cause us some trouble. While \u2018holey\u2019 and\n\u2018holy\u2019 are homophonous, they are not co-spelled. Thus an\nutterance of \u2018the temple is holey\u2019 is ambiguous between\ntwo sentences, while an inscription in English is not. Sometimes\nco-spelled words are distinct sounding, such as \u2018refuse\u2019\nwhich is distinct sounding (in my dialect at least) between\n\u2018ree-fuze\u2019 and \u2018reh-fuse\u2019. Fortunately, we\nhave the relevant categories to describe these differences and we can\ntalk about ambiguity in sound or in notation (or in sign).\n",
