    "main_text": "Theories of Well-being || Objective List Theories\n4.3 Objective List Theories\n\nThe threefold distinction I am using between different theories of\nwell-being has become standard in contemporary ethics (Parfit 1984:\napp. I). There are problems with it, however, as with many\nclassifications, since it can blind one to other ways of\ncharacterizing views (see Kagan 1992; Hurka 2019). Objective list\ntheories are usually understood as theories which list items\nconstituting well-being that consist neither merely in pleasurable\nexperience nor in desire-satisfaction. Such items might include, for\nexample, knowledge or friendship. But it is worth remembering, for\nexample, that hedonism might be seen as one kind of \u2018list\u2019\ntheory, and all list theories might then be opposed to desire theories\nas a whole.\n\nWhat should go on the list (Moore 2000)? It is important that every\ngood should be included. As Aristotle put it: \u2018We take what is\nself-sufficient to be that which on its own makes life worthy of\nchoice and lacking in nothing. We think happiness to be such, and\nindeed the thing most of all worth choosing, not counted as just one\nthing among others\u2019 (Nicomachean Ethics, 1097b, tr.\nCrisp). In other words, if you claim that well-being consists only in\nfriendship and pleasure, I can show your list to be unsatisfactory if\nI can demonstrate that knowledge is also something that makes people\nbetter off.\n\nWhat is the \u2018good-maker\u2019, according to objective list\ntheorists? This depends on the theory. One, influenced by Aristotle\nand recently developed by Thomas Hurka (1993; see Bradford 2017), is\nperfectionism, according to which what makes things\nconstituents of well-being is their perfecting human nature. (On the\nhistory of modern perfectionism, see Brink 2019.) If it is part\nof human nature to acquire knowledge, for example, then a\nperfectionist should claim that knowledge is a constituent of\nwell-being. But there is nothing to prevent an objective list\ntheorist\u2019s claiming that all that the items on her list have in\ncommon is that each, in its own way, advances well-being.\n\nHow do we decide what goes on the list? All we can work on is the\ndeliverance of reflective judgement\u2014intuition, if you like. But\none should not conclude from this that objective list theorists are,\nbecause they are intuitionist, less satisfactory than the other two\ntheories. For those theories too can be based only on reflective\njudgement. Nor should one think that intuitionism rules out argument.\nArgument is one way to bring people to see the truth. Further, we\nshould remember that intuitions can be mistaken. Indeed, as suggested\nabove, this is the strongest line of defence available to hedonists:\nto attempt to undermine the evidential weight of many of our natural\nbeliefs about what is good for people.\n\nOne common objection to objective list theories is that they are\n\u00e9litist, since they appear to be claiming that certain things\nare good for people, even if those people will not enjoy them, and do\nnot even want them. One strategy here might be to adopt a\n\u2018hybrid\u2019 account, according to which certain goods do\nbenefit people independently of pleasure and desire-satisfaction, but\nonly when they do in fact bring pleasure and/or satisfy desires.\nAnother would be to bite the bullet, and point out that a theory could\nbe both \u00e9litist and true.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that objective list theories need not\ninvolve any kind of objectionable authoritarianism or perfectionism.\nFirst, one might wish to include autonomy on one\u2019s list,\nclaiming that the informed and reflective living of one\u2019s own\nlife for oneself itself constitutes a good. Second, and perhaps more\nsignificantly, one might note that any theory of well-being in itself\nhas no direct moral implications. There is nothing logically to\nprevent one\u2019s holding a highly \u00e9litist conception of\nwell-being alongside a strict liberal view that forbade paternalistic\ninterference of any kind with a person\u2019s own life (indeed, on\nsome interpretations, J.S. Mill\u2019s position is close to\nthis).\n\nOne not implausible view, if desire theories are indeed mistaken in\ntheir reversal of the relation between desire and what is good, is\nthat the debate is really between hedonism and objective list\ntheories. And, as suggested above, what is most at stake here is the\nissue of the epistemic adequacy of our beliefs about well-being. The\nbest way to resolve this matter would consist, in large part at least,\nin returning once again to the experience machine objection, and\nseeking to discover whether that objection really stands.\n",
