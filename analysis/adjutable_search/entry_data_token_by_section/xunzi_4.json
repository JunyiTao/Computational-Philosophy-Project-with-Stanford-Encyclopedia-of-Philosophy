Is the Way Discovered or Constructed?\n\nAlthough this discussion has presented the Way as an unchanging\ncosmological reality to which we must conform (or suffer the\nconsequences), it is sometimes understood, rather, as having been\nconstructed by human beings. A.C. Graham first raised this issue by\nasking, \u201cIs Xunzi saying that man imposes his own meaning on an\notherwise meaningless universe?\u201d (Graham 1989: 243). Although\nGraham himself answered his question in the negative, others have\nsince pressed the point further. This is probably the greatest\ncontroversy in Xunzi studies today.\n\nOne passage, in particular, is frequently cited as support for a\nconstructivist position (Hagen 2007: 11.n31; Tang 2016: 59, 75, 118):\n\u201cThe Way is not the Way of Heaven, nor the Way of Earth; it is\nwhat people regard as the Way, what the noble man is guided by\u201d\n(Xunzi 8.3). This seems to say, despite what we have seen\nabout apprehending the constancy of Heaven and then applying it\nprofitably to daily life, that we are supposed to disregard the Way of\nHeaven, and create our own Way instead. The basic problem is that the\nsurviving text of Xunzi is vague enough to permit various\ninterpretations, but the repeated references to the importance of\nobserving and appropriately \u201cresponding\u201d (ying\n\u61c9) to the seasons would seem to rule out the interpretation\nthat natural patterns are not to be taken as normative.\n\nYang Liang \u694a\u501e (fl. 818 CE), the author of the oldest\nextant commentary on Xunzi, evidently recognized this\nproblem, and tried to soften the impact of Xunzi 8.3 by\nmaking it fit with the rest of the text: \n\n\nThis emphasizes that the Way of the Former Kings was not a matter of\nyin and yang, or mountains and rivers, or omens and\nprodigies, but the Way that people practice. \n\n\nYang Liang\u2019s opinion is surely not decisive: he was but an\ninterpreter, not the master himself, and his glosses are not always\nregarded as the most compelling today. But in this case he may have\nbeen right that Xunzi meant to say no more than that the Way is to be\nfound not in prodigies and other freakish occurrences, but in the\n\u201cconstancies\u201d that people can put into practice. Indeed,\nthe very notion that the Way of Heaven, the Way of Earth, and the Way\nof human beings are distinct entities would contradict the frequently\nreiterated point that there is only one Way, e.g., \u201cThere are no\ntwo Ways in the world, and the Sage is never of two minds\u201d\n(Xunzi 21.1). This single and holistic Way, moreover, serves\nas the enduring standard for all times because all ramified truths of\nthe universe are unified within it (Xunzi 5.5, 21.6b, and\n22.6b).\n\nWhat we need to understand, then, is the Way as it pertains to\nhuman beings. Unusual celestial phenomena such as shooting stars\nmust, theoretically, be explainable by a comprehensive formulation of\nthe Way\u2014there can be no violations of the Way in the\nnatural world\u2014but this is exactly why we do not aim for a\ncomprehensive formulation of the Way (cf. Hutton 2016a: 81\u201383).\nWe can safely ignore shooting stars as irrelevant to human beings\nbecause they do not provide replicable patterns for use in moral and\nsocial development. Responding to the seasons with timely planting and\nharvesting is, once again, a more productive model.\n",
