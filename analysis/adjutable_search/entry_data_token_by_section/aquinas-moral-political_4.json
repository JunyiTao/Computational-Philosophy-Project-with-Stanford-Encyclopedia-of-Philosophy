    "main_text": "Practical reason\u2019s first principles || Precondition: capacity for self-determination by free choices\n2.1 Precondition: capacity for self-determination by free choices\n\nPractical reason\u2019s central activity is deliberation about what\nto do. One would have no need to deliberate unless one were confronted\nby alternative attractive possibilities for action (kinds of\nopportunity) between which one must choose (in the sense that one\ncannot do both at the same time, if at all) and can choose. The\nstandards that one comes to understand to be the appropriate guides\nfor one\u2019s deliberation, choice and action give such guidance,\nnot by predicting what one will do, but by directing what one\nshould do. (The \u201cshould\u201d here may but need not be moral.)\nThere could be no normativity, no practical (choice-guiding)\ndirectiveness, unless free choices were really possible.\n\nAquinas\u2019s position is not that all our activities are freely\nchosen: there are indeed \u201cacts of the human person\u201d,\nperhaps quite frequent, which are not \u201chuman acts\u201d in the\ncentral sense (freely chosen) but rather spontaneous and\nundeliberated. Nor is it that chosen acts must be immediately preceded\nby choice: many of one\u2019s acts are the carrying out of choices\nwhich were made in the past and need not be now renewed or repeated\nsince no alternative option appears attractive. It is that one can be\nand often is in such a position that, confronted by two or more\nattractive possibilities (including perhaps the option of \u201cdoing\nnothing\u201d), there is nothing either within or outside one\u2019s\npersonal constitution that determines (settles) one\u2019s choice,\nother than the choosing: Mal. q. 6. This conception of free\nchoice (liberum arbitrium or libera electio) is much\nstronger than Aristotle\u2019s, on whose conception free choices are\nfree only from external determining factors. Aquinas\u2019\nconception of free choice is also incompatible with modern notions of\nsoft determinism, or the supposed compatibility of human\nresponsibility (and of the sense [self-understanding] that\none is freely choosing) with determination of every event by laws\n(e.g. physical) of nature. Aquinas understands the freedom of our free\nchoices to be a reality as primary and metaphysically and conceptually\nirreducible as the reality of physical laws, and he puts all his\nreflections on morality and practical reason under the heading of\n\u201cmastery over one\u2019s own acts\u201d (ST I-II,\nprologue).\n\nHe is also insistent that if there were no such freedom and\nself-determination, there could be no responsibility (fault, merit,\netc.), and no sense or content to any ought (normativity)\nsuch as ethics is concerned with.\n2.1.1 Choice, intention and act-descriptions\n\nAquinas pulls together into a powerful (though confusingly expounded)\nsynthesis a long tradition of analysis of the elements of\nunderstanding (reason) and intelligent response (will) that constitute\ndeliberation, choice, and execution of choice: ST I-II qq.\n6\u201317. The analysis shows the centrality of intention in the\nassessment of options and actions. In a narrow sense of the word,\nintention is always of ends and choice is of means;\nbut since every means (save the means most proximate to sheer trying\nor exertion) is also an end relative to a more proximate means, what\nis chosen when one adopts one of two or more proposals (for\none\u2019s action) that one has shaped in one\u2019s deliberation is\nrightly, though more broadly, said to be what one intends, what one\ndoes intentionally or with intent(ion), and so forth. An act(ion) is\nparadigmatically what it is intended to be; that is, its morally\nprimary description \u2013 prior to any moral evaluation or predicate\n\u2013 is the description it had in the deliberation by which one\nshaped the proposal to act thus. Aquinas\u2019 way of saying\nthis is: acts are specified by \u2013 have their specific\ncharacter from \u2013 their objects, where \u201cobjects\u201d\nhas the focal meaning of proximate end as envisaged by the\ndeliberating and acting person. Of course, the behavior involved in\nthat act can be given other descriptions in the light of conventions\nof description, or expectations and responsibilities, and so forth,\nand one or other these descriptions may be given priority by law,\ncustom, or some other special interest or perspective. But it is\nprimarily on acts qua intended, or on the acts (e.g. of\ntaking care) that one ought to have intended, that ethical standards\n(moral principles and precepts) bear. To repeat: in the preceding\nsentence \u201cintended\u201d is used in the broad sense; Aquinas\nsometimes employs it this way (e.g. ST II-II q. 64 a. 7),\nthough in his official synthesis the word is used in the narrower\nsense to signify the (further) intention with which the\nact\u2019s object was chosen \u2013 object being the most proximate\nof one\u2019s (broad sense) intentions.\n\nThis understanding of human action has often been misappropriated by\ninterpreters who have assumed that when Aquinas says that acts are\nwrongful by reason of their \u201cundue matter\u201d (indebita\nmateria), he refers to an item of behavior specifiable by its\nphysical characteristics and causal structure. So, for example,\ndirect killing of the innocent is taken to refer to\nbehavior whose causally immediate effect is killing, or which has its\nlethal effect before it has its intended good effect. But this is\nincompatible with Aquinas\u2019 fundamental and consistent positions\nabout human action. The \u201cmatter\u201d of a morally significant\nact is, for him, its immediate object under the description it has in\none\u2019s deliberation: Mal. q. 7 a. 1; q. 2 a. 4 ad 5; a.\n6; a. 7 ad 8. It is, in other words, not an item of behavior\nconsidered in its observable physicality as such, but rather\none\u2019s behavior as one\u2019s objective (or the most proximate\nof one\u2019s objectives), that is, as one envisages it, adopts it by\nchoice, and causes it by one\u2019s effort to do so. The most\nobjective account of human action is provided by the account that is\nmost subjective. This sound account will, however, set aside any\ndistorted act-descriptions that one may offer others, or even oneself,\nas rationalizations and exculpations of one\u2019s choice and act,\nbut that do not correspond to what really made the option attractive,\nas end or as means, and so was treated, in one\u2019s actual course\nof deliberation, as one\u2019s reason for acting as one did. The\nimmediately and foreseen lethal effect of an act of self-defense may\ngenuinely be a side-effect of one\u2019s choosing to stop the attack\nby the only available efficacious means (ST II-II q. 64 a.\n7), or it may be one\u2019s precise object (and the\n\u201cmatter\u201d of one\u2019s choice and act) because\none\u2019s (further) intent was to take lethal revenge on an old\nenemy, or to deter potential assailants by the prospect of their\ndeath, or to win a reward. Behaviorally identical items of behavior\nmay thus be very different human acts, discernible only by knowing the\nacting person\u2019s reasons for acting.\n",
