    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Theoretical Philosophy || Philosophy of Language and Logic\n3.1 Philosophy of Language and Logic\n\nThough Mill holds that basic human thought is possible without\nlanguage, \u201cin complicated cases [it] can take place in no other\nway\u201d (System, VII: 19). As such, a study of human\nbeings\u2019 theoretical engagement with the world demands clarity on\nthis \u201cfundamental instrument of thought\u201d (System,\nVIII: 663; see also Losonsky 2006: 119\u201328). Mill\u2019s account\nof language turns upon a distinction between the denotation\nand connotation of a word. Words denote the objects\nwhich they are true of; they connote specific attributes of\nthose objects. The word \u201cman\u201d, for instance,\ndenotes, or is true of, all men\u2014\u201cPeter, Paul,\nJohn, and an indefinite number of other individuals\u201d\n(System, VII: 31). But it connotes the attributes in\nvirtue of which the word \u201cman\u201d applies to these\nindividuals\u2014\u201ccorporeity, animal life, rationality, and a\ncertain external form, which for distinction we call the human\u201d\n(System, VII: 31). Connotation determines denotation\nin the following sense: to know the connotation of a word is to know\nthe necessary and sufficient conditions to determine whether a given\nobject is denoted by that word.\n\nNot all words have connotation. Mill notes that words can be\nsingular or general. \u201cCicero\u201d is a\nsingular name\u2014applying to only one object, namely Cicero.\n\u201cRoman\u201d is, by contrast, a general name\u2014applying to\nmany objects, including Cicero but also Augustus, Nero, and many\nothers. While \u201call concrete general names are connotative\u201d\n(System, VII: 32)\u2014signaling the attributes which\njustify our application of the name to individual objects\u2014the\nsame cannot be said of singular names. To be sure, some\nsingular names are connotative\u2014\u201cthe author of De Re\nPublica\u201d is, as we would say, a definite description, and\npicks out one individual by way of signaling its attributes\u2014but\nnot all are. The name \u201cCicero\u201d does not connote any\nattributes at all\u2014but is a proper name, and serves simply as a\nmarker for that individual (Schwartz\n 2014).[1]\n\nThe analysis affords a simple means of determining the meaning of a\nvast range of simple propositions\u2014those portions of discourse\n\u201cin which one predicate is affirmed or denied of one\nsubject\u201d by way of a copula such as is, or is\nnot (System, VII: 81)\u2014and their composition into\nmore complex linguistic entities (Skorupski 1989: 178\u201392). The\nproposition S is P can be understood, in the case that\nP is a connoting term, as the claim that the object denoted\nby S has the attribute connoted by P. \u201cThe\nsummit of Chimborazo is white\u201d asserts a fact about the\nworld\u2014that the object denoted by the name \u201cthe summit of\nChimborazo\u201d has the attribute connoted by the name\n\u201cwhite\u201d (System, VII: 97). The proposition S\nis P, where P is a non-connoting term, can be understood\nas the claim that the object denoted by S is the same object\nas that denoted by P. \u201cTully is Cicero\u201d asserts\nmerely a fact about those names\u2014that the name\n\u201cTully\u201d is used to refer to the same object as the name\n\u201cCicero\u201d.\n\nThe difference is key. We learn nothing about the world when\nwe learn that \u201cTully is Cicero\u201d is true\u2014this\nproposition does not convey a fact about how things are, but\nrather about our own linguistic conventions of naming\n(System, VII: 110). The proposition is, in Mill\u2019s\nterminology, merely verbal. Such propositions are key to\nunderstanding the uninformative nature of a priori\npropositions and a priori reasoning. Mill, quite rightly,\ndoes not make the claim that a priori propositions such as\n\u201cevery man is a living creature\u201d are, like \u201cTully is\nCicero\u201d, assertions merely about our own conventions of naming.\nBut he does argue that such propositions share the feature of\nconveying no genuine information about the world. For the connotation\nof \u201cman\u201d\u2014the attributes it\nsignals\u2014includes the connotation of \u201cliving\ncreature\u201d. Someone who already knows the meaning of the term\n\u201cman\u201d is not told anything about how the world is\nwhen told that \u201cevery man is a living creature\u201d (Kroon\n2017: 214\u20136).\n\nDeductive or a priori reasoning, Mill thinks, is similarly\nempty. Predating the revolution in logic that the late\nnineteenth-century ushered in, Mill thinks of deductive reasoning\nprimarily in terms of the syllogism. Syllogistic reasoning, he argues\ncan elicit no new truths about how the world is: \u201cnothing ever\nwas, or can be proved by syllogism which was not known, or assumed to\nbe known, before\u201d (System, VII: 183).\n\n\nPremise 1: All men are mortal,\n\nPremise 2: Socrates is a man,\n\nConclusion: Socrates is mortal.\n\n\nIn standard syllogistic inferences, he argues, for arguments to be\nvalid, the conclusion must already have been asserted in the premises.\nBy way of example, in the above argument, the conclusion must already\nhave been asserted in the\n Premise 1\u2014the\n proposition that all men are mortal must be said to include\nthe proposition that Socrates is mortal if the argument is to be valid.\nNo new knowledge is therefore acquired in reasoning from premises to\nconclusion. The claim is perhaps more difficult to support than Mill\nappreciates, depending, as it does, upon equating of the meaning of a\nuniversal statement with the meaning of a conjunction of singular\nstatement (Fumerton 2017: 200). Nevertheless, Mill\u2019s argument\nthat we can learn nothing about the world by reflecting on our\nlanguage dovetails neatly with his naturalistic claim that all genuine\ncognitive advancement must take place by observation.\n\nThe suggestion that deductive reasoning cannot lead us to any new\nknowledge prompts two questions. Firstly, if not the advancement of\nknowledge, what is the function of syllogistic reasoning?\nAnd, secondly, what are we to say about apparently deductive reasoning\nwhich manifestly does lead us to new knowledge? To the first\nquestion, Mill answers that syllogistic reasoning allows us\n\u201ctest\u201d our commitment to general propositions\n(System, VII: 196). In making arguments such as the one\nabove, we cannot acquire new knowledge: for no facts beyond those\nwhich are in the premises are present in the conclusion. But the\nimplications of holding a general premise are more clearly displayed\nby the syllogistic reasoning, and this, in certain instances, may\ncause us to re-evaluate our commitment to that premise. To the second\nquestion, Mill holds that where we do gain genuinely new\nknowledge\u2014in cases of mathematics and geometry, for\ninstance\u2014we must, at some level, be reasoning\ninductively. Mill, that is to say, attempts to account for\nthe genuine informativeness of mathematical and geometric reasoning by\ndenying that they are in any real sense a priori. We shall\nreturn to this claim in\n \u00a73.4.\n",
