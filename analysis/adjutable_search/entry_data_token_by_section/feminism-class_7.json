    "main_text": "Modernist vs. Postmodernist Feminist Theory\n8. Modernist vs. Postmodernist Feminist Theory\n\nUseful anthologies of the first stage of second wave socialist\nfeminist writings which include discussions of women, class and work\nfrom psychological as well as sociological and economic perspectives\nare Eisenstein (1979), Hansen and Philipson (1990), Hennessy and\nIngraham (1997), and Holmstrom (2002). Jaggar (1983) wrote perhaps the\nfirst philosophy text explaining the categories of liberal, radical,\nMarxist and socialist-feminist thought and defending a\nsocialist-feminist theory of male domination based on the notion of\nwomen\u2019s alienated labor. Others such as Jaggar and Rothenberg\n(1978), Tuana and Tong (1995) and Herrmann and Stewart (1993) include\nclassic socialist feminist analyses in their collections, inviting\ncomparisons of the authors to others grouped under the categories of\nliberal, radical, psychoanalytic, Marxist, postmodern, postcolonial\nand multicultural feminisms.\n\nVarious post-modern critiques of these earlier feminist schools of\nthought such as post-colonialism as well as deconstruction and\npost-structuralism challenge the over-generalizations and economic\nreductionism of many of those constructing feminist theories that fall\nunder the early categories of liberal, radical, Marxist or socialist\nfeminism (cf. Grewal and Kaplan 1992; Kaplan et al. 1999;\nNicholson 1991; Fraser and Nicholson 1991; hooks 1984, 2000;\nAnzald\u00faa and Moraga 1981; Sandoval 2000). Others argue that\npart of the problem is the master narratives of liberalism or Marxism,\nthe first of which sees all domination relations due to traditional\nhierarchies and undermined by capitalism, thus ignoring the\nindependent effectivity of racism (Joseph 1981); and the second of\nwhich ties all domination relations to the structure of contemporary\ncapitalism and ignores the non-capitalist economics contexts in which\nmany women work, even within so-called capitalist economies, such as\nhousework and voluntary community work (Gibson-Graham 1996).\n\nIn spite of the \u201cpomo\u201d critiques, there are some powerful\nthinkers within this tendency who have not completely rejected a more\ngeneral starting point of analysis based on women, class and work. For\nexample, Spivak (1988), Mohanty (1997), Carby (1997), and Hennessy\n(1993, 2000) are creating and re-articulating forms of Marxist and\nsocialist-feminism less susceptible to charges of over-generalization\nand reductionism, and more compatible with close contextual analysis\nof the power relations of gender and class as they relate to work.\nThey can be grouped loosely with a tendency called materialist\nfeminism that incorporates some of the methods of deconstruction and\npost-structuralism (Hennessy 1993; Landry and MacLean 1993).\n",
