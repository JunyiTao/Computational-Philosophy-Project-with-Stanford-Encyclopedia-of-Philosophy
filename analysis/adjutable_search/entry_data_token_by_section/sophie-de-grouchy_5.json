    "main_text": "Works\n3. Works\n\nSophie de Grouchy only published one book in her own name: a short\ntext entitled Huit Lettres sur la Sympathie translated as\nThe Letters on Sympathy, which she appended to her\ntranslation of two texts by Adam Smith: The Theory of Moral\nSentiments and The Origins of Language. We do, however,\nhave evidence that she wrote other texts. Grouchy edited a republican\njournal with her husband in 1791 and there are two articles that,\nalthough unsigned, can be attributed to her. She also contributed\ntranslations and articles by Thomas Paine to the journal, and later\npublished her own translation of Adam Smith\u2019s works. There is\nalso evidence of some unpublished (and possibly unfinished) work,\nwhich Condorcet refers to in a letter to his daughter.\n",
