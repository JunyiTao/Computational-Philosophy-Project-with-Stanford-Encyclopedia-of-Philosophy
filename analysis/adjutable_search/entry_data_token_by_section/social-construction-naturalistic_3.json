Of course,\n\u201cconstruction\u201d talk is meant to evoke a variety of\nconnotations that attend more paradigmatic construction: intentional\nactivity, engaged in step-by step fashion, producing a designed,\nartifactual product. While different objects lead constructionist talk\nto be interpreted in different ways, we can distinguish two different\nsorts of relationship: causal or\n constitutive.[7]\n On the first, X constructs Y if Y is\ncaused to come to exist, to continue to exist, or to have the\nproperties that it does by X. On the second, Y is\nconstructed if it is constituted by X\u2019s\nconceptual or social activity (perhaps even independently of\nX\u2019s causal influence on Y).\n\nThe first, and more straightforward idea is causal\nconstruction:\n\nX causally constructs Y if and only if\nX causes Y to exist or to persist or X\ncontrols the kind-typical properties of\n Y.[8]\n\n\nThere is no special problem posed by the claim that human social and\nlinguistic activities cause certain things to exist or persist, or\ncause certain facts to be. More obscure is the idea that\nX\u2019s construction of Y is some sort of\nconstitutive relationship. Many constructionist claims seem\nto involve the idea that the world is itself \u201cmade up\u201d by\nsocial and cultural activities in ways that suggest our\nsocio-linguistic behaviors are at least necessary to the object in\nquestion. This suggests a relationship such as:\n\nX constitutively constructs Y if and only\nif X\u2019s conceptual or social activity regarding an\nindividual y is metaphysically necessary for y to be\na Y.\n\n\nConsider the ways in which causal and constitutive claims might pull\napart in a case of a socially produced artifact. Representations\nexpressing the concept watch are normally causally necessary\nfor some materials to come to have the intrinsic features of a watch,\nbut they are not metaphysically necessary. It is metaphysically\npossible, however unlikely, that we could walk across a heath and find\n(something with the intrinsic features of) a watch that had\n\u201calways been there.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the best candidates for constitutive construction are\nsocial facts:\n\nFor social facts, the attitude that we take toward the phenomenon is\npartly constitutive of the phenomenon \u2026 Part of being a\ncocktail party is being thought to be a cocktail party; part of being\na war is being thought to be a war. This is a remarkable feature of\nsocial facts; it has no analogue among physical facts. (Searle 1995,\n33\u201334)\n\n\nOn Searle\u2019s view, a particular gathering of persons can be a\ncocktail party only with the conceptual and social recognition of\nthose gathered. A similar idea has been influential in constructionist\ndiscussions. For example, the provocative claims that there were no\nhomosexuals before the concept homosexual came to be\nexpressed in Western culture in the nineteenth century (e.g. Foucault\n1978, Halperin 1990) or that race is a modern invention (e.g Taylor\n2004) seem to make sense if we see sexual or racial kinds as in part\nconstituted by our concepts of them.\n\nBut Searle is right that there is something remarkable here, at least\nin the case of social facts: somehow our conceptual scheme or practice\nare necessary to make it true that some event instantiates\ncocktail party or war. What is wanted is, at a\nminimum, a model of this production\u2014a model of exactly how the\nconceptual practice constitutes the fact. Perhaps the most obvious\nmodel to explain such constitutive claims is to hold that the relevant\nnecessity is analytic, it holds in virtue of the meaning of\nthe relevant term or concept. It is a fact about the meaning of\n\u201ccocktail party\u201d and perhaps \u201chomosexual\u201d and\n\u201crace\u201d) that it does not apply to a thing unless it is\nrecognized to do so.\n\nWhether any such meaning claims can be accommodated has been\na contentious question since Quine (1953), but it is a question we can\nput aside for now (see\n The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction).\n Instead, we should ask whether such model of constitutivity as\nanalyticity is plausible for objects of social construction.\n\nOn the one hand, if Searle\u2019s general account of social facts is\ncorrect, there may be many terms that operate like \u201ccocktail\nparty\u201d in that the participants produce them only when they\nshare certain intentional states about what they are doing. On the\nother hand, this does not seem plausible for the objects of many\nsocial constructionist claims. Remember, it is a mainstay of\nconstructionist research to claim that social influence is exercised\nin surprising and provocative ways, especially on objects that we take\nto be produced naturally. But just this feature suggests that it\ncannot be part of our ordinary concepts of covertly constructed kinds\nthat instances require our social-conceptual imprimatur to be members\nof these kinds (Machery 2014, Mallon 2017). This point is highlighted\nin a more general way by Paul Boghossian\u2019s query:\n\nisn\u2019t it part of the very concept of an electron, or of\na mountain, that these things were not constructed by us?\nTake electrons, for example. Is it not part of the very purpose of\nhaving such a concept that it is to designate things that are\nindependent of us? (2006, 39)\n\n\nIf this is right, constructionists who view construction as a\nconstitutive relation need another account of the necessity of our\nconceptual practice: it is implausible and inconsistent to claim that\nthe necessity arises out of concept or word meanings in cases of\ncovert construction.\n\nThere is a different model of necessity for the constructionist,\nhowever, which is to hold that the necessity in question is revealed\na posteriori by our investigations of the phenomenon in\nquestion. Saul Kripke (1980), Hilary Putnam (1975) and others defended\na causal theory of reference on which some terms (notably natural kind\nterms) referred to some sort of stuff or essence underlying the\ncentral uses of the term (see\n Reference: Causal Theories).\n Crucially, however, because the reference relation is external,\ncompetent users of a term can be radically mistaken about what the\nterm refers to and still successfully refer. In the case of water, for\nexample, Putnam suggests that \u201cwater\u201d picks out the sort\nof stuff that bears the appropriate causal-historical relation to\nparadigmatic instances in our own causal history (viz.\nH2O), and this was true even when we did not know what sort\nof stuff that was (i.e. before we knew the chemical structure).\nKripke, Putnam, and others emphasized that claims such as\n\u201cwater=H2O\u201d express necessary though a\nposteriori truths.\n\nWhile the causal theory of reference (and its correct interpretation)\nremains controversial, in many quarters of philosophy it has become\naccepted wisdom. It is thus an option for interpreters of social\nconstructionism to claim that certain terms\u2014for example,\n\u201crace\u201d\u2014actually refer to a kind that is produced by\nour socio-linguistic behavior, even if that fact is revealed only\na\n posteriori.[9]\n Such a constitutive constructionist could grant, then, that it is\npart of our ordinary conception of the concept (e.g. of race) that \u2013\nlike electron \u2013 it refers to an independent, natural fact about the\nworld, but such a constructionist would insist that further\nexploration of the world reveals that conventional features of our\npractice produce the object of our study. As with the case of\n\u201cwater\u201d before modern chemistry, the conception widely\nassociated with \u201crace\u201d (viz. that it is a biological kind)\nis wrong, but the term successfully refers all the same. Ideally, for\nsuch an approach to work, the constitutive constructionist would like\nan independent characterization of the sorts of social objects that\ninvestigation reveals to be identical with the kinds in question (e.g.\n\u00c1sta 2016; Bach 2012; Mallon 2003, 2016), but they also need to\nfend off critics of applying the causal theory of reference in the\ncontext of reference to socially produced objects (e.g. Thomasson\n2003) as well as more general critiques of employing theories of\nreference as premises in arguments with philosophically significant\nconclusions (Mallon et al. 2009, Mallon 2007b). Still, if it can be\nmade to work, this strategy would make sense of constitutive\nconstructionist claims while respecting Boghossian\u2019s idea (one\nthat is also central to constructionism) that these kinds are\nordinarily believed to be natural and independent of us. For this\nreason, this strategy has been suggested in the case of race, gender,\nand other human kinds (Haslanger 2003, 2005; Mallon 2003, 2016), and\nmore generally for scientific facts (Boyd 1992). \n\nOf course, there may well be other models of necessity available. For\nexample, it is sometimes suggested that a neo-Kantian interpretation\nof social constructionism is possible, an interpretation on which our\nsocio-linguistic activities could provide a transcendental basis for\nany knowledge of the world. Such an interpretation might allow certain\napparently radical constitutive claims, but the challenge would remain\nto reconcile the view with a naturalistic conception of ourselves,\nsomething such a proposal may fail to do (e.g. Boyd 1992, Rosen\n1994).\n",
