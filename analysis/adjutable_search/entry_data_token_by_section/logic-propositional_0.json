    "main_text": "Basic Framework\n1. Basic Framework\n\nThe formal language of propositional logic consists of\n\u201catomic\u201d propositional variables, \\(p_1\\), \\(p_2\\),\n\\(p_3\\), \u2026, and propositional connectives, \\(c_1^1\\),\n\\(c_2^1\\), \\(c_3^1\\), \u2026, \\(c_1^2\\), \\(c_2^2\\), \\(c_3^2\\),\n\u2026, \\(c_1^3\\), \u2026. The expressions\u2019 subscripts are\nused to distinguish them from one another; the fact that we use\nnatural numbers indicates the typical convention that the vocabulary\nbe countable. The propositional connectives\u2019 superscripts\nindicate their \u201carity\u201d, i.e., the number of propositions\nthat they operate on in order to create a new proposition. The\nformulas of propositional logic are defined recursively by\n\n\n\nAtomic propositional variables are formulas.\n\n\nIf \\(c_n^m\\) is a propositional connective, and \\(\\langle\\)A, B, C,\n\u2026\\(\\rangle\\) is a sequence of m, possibly but not\nnecessarily atomic, possibly but not necessarily distinct, formulas,\nthen the result of applying \\(c_n^m\\) to \\(\\langle\\)A, B, C,\n\u2026\\(\\rangle\\) is a formula.\n\n\nThe result of applying \\(c_n^m\\) to \\(\\langle\\)A, B, C,\n\u2026\\(\\rangle\\) is customarily written in functional notation:\n\\(c_n^m\\)(A, B, C, \u2026). Examples of formulas are\n\n\n\n\\(p_4\\)\n\n\n\\(c_1^2(p_7, p_3)\\)\n\n\n\\(c_2^2(c_1^1(p_1), c_1^1(c_1^2(p_2, p_3)))\\)\n\n\n\\(c_5^3(p_2, c_3^2(c_4^1(c_6^2(p_3, p_3)), p_5),\nc_9^1(p_2))\\)\n\n\nThis recursive definition of the formulas of propositional logic\njustifies the use of the label \u201catomic\u201d for the\npropositional variables: Every formula is built up stepwise from atoms\nthrough a finite application of propositional connectives. It can be\nhelpful to think of the connectives as \u201cpropositional\nfunctions\u201d that take propositions (denoted by formulas) as input\nand return propositions as output. The space of propositions is then\ngiven as the free algebra on the atomic formulas generated by these\nfunctions, and the specification of a proposition is given by the\nstandard \u201ccomposition of functions\u201d notation. This\nterminology is not common, however, because the expression\n\u201cpropositional function\u201d has a quite different use of high\ncurrency (see the entry on\n Bertrand Russell).\n\nIt is customary to indicate the specific connectives one is studying\nwith special characters, typically \\(\\wedge\\), \\(\\vee\\), \\(\\supset\\),\n\\(\\neg\\), to use infix notation for binary connectives, and to display\nparentheses only when there would otherwise be ambiguity. It is also\ncommon to investigate properties of propositional formulas that do not\ndepend on the the occurrence of atoms fundamentally, in which case\nformula variables A, B, C, etc. appear in the expression in place of\nsentence letters. Thus if \\(c_1^1\\) is relabeled \\(\\neg\\), \\(c_1^2\\)\nis relabeled \\(\\wedge\\), and \\(c_2^2\\) is relabeled \\(\\vee\\), then in\nplace of the\n third formula\n listed above one would write \\(\\neg\\rA\\vee\\neg(\\rB\\wedge\\rC)\\).\n",
