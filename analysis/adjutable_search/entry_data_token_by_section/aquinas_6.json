    "main_text": "Cognitive Theory || Perception\n6.1 Perception\n\nBy definition, the living things that we call animals are those that\nhave the power of perception. Aquinas accepts the conventional list of\nthe five senses\u2014sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch\u2014and\nargues that we arrive at this list of five because there are five\ndiscrete kinds of qualities that make an impression on our bodies.\nThese objects are the proper sensibles\u2014color, sound,\nodor, flavor, hot\u2013cold\u2014so-called because they \u201cmake\nan impression on the senses primarily and per se\u201d\n(ST 1a 78.3 ad 2). In contrast to these are the common\nsensibles\u2014size, shape, number, motion, rest\u2014which\n\u201cdo not move the senses primary and of themselves, but on\naccount of a sensible quality, as a surface does on account of its\ncolor\u201d (ibid.). Whereas each proper sensible is capable of being\nperceived only by its corresponding sense, the common sensibles are\nso-called because they can be grasped by multiple senses, as when we\nboth see and hear a thing move. To these two categories of sense\nobjects Aquinas adds a third category, the accidental\nsensibles, as when I see that someone is alive (Comm. de\nanima II.13.184\u201390). This is, however, not a purely sensory\noperation, but an act of seeing that occurs in conjunction with a\nconceptual judgment that the observed motions are a sign of life. (For\ndiscussions of the perceptual process see Pasnau 2002 chs. 6, 9;\nLisska 2016; De Haan 2019; Cory 2022.)\n\nBeyond these five external senses are the four internal\nsenses that use the brain as their organ. Following the lead of\n Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\n (Avicenna), Aquinas puts considerable weight on these sensory powers\nto explain the sophisticated behavior of animals. In contrast to the\nconsensus over the number of external senses, there had been a great\ndeal of historical disagreement over how many internal senses there\nare. Aquinas settles on this list of four:\n\nthe common sense;\nimagination (or phantasia);\nthe estimative (or cogitative) power;\nmemory.\n\n\nThe precise role of these four faculties is not easy to evaluate on\nthe basis of Aquinas\u2019s limited and scattered remarks, but\naccording to his most prominent account the common sense is what\nallows us to make cross-modal sensory judgments (seeing something as\nwhite and sweet) and to have second-order awareness, for instance\n\u201cwhen someone sees that he is seeing\u201d (ST 1a 78.4\nad 2). The imagination\u2014Aquinas uses both imaginatio and\nphantasia to refer to this faculty\u2014retains images\nacquired through the external senses. The estimative power perceives\nwhat the Arabic tradition referred to as the \u201cintentions\u201d\n(ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b) that lie behind the sensible\nqualities: for instance, that wolves are dangerous and that straw is\nuseful for nest building. (Aquinas refers to the more sophisticated\nhuman capacity for grasping intentions as the cogitative power.)\nMemory preserves these intentions. All of the internal senses are\nrichly engaged in human cognitive activity, which is to say that the\nbrain\u2014despite not being the power of intellect\u2014plays a\ncritical role in human cognition.\n\nThe senses are not wholly immaterial faculties in the way that the\nintellect is, but the respect in which Aquinas thinks they are\nmaterial is a matter of some dispute. He remarks that the senses\noperate \u201cthrough a corporeal organ but not through any corporeal\nquality\u201d (ST 1a 78.1c). By this he intends a contrast\nwith ordinary physical causation, as when a fire, through the quality\nof heat, brings water to a boil. In contrast, when we perceive heat,\neven though the skin is heated in the same way that water is, still\nthe perception itself is not the skin\u2019s being made hot. Rather,\n\u201cthe senses and intellect receive the forms of things\nspiritually and immaterially, in virtue of a kind of intentional\nexistence\u201d (Comm. de sensu 18.208\u201310). In\ngeneral, Aquinas treats the ability to receive forms intentionally as\na mark of the mental:\n\nThings that cognize are distinguished from things that do not cognize\nin this: that the non-cognizers have nothing but their own form alone,\nwhereas that which cognizes is naturally suited to have the form of\nanother thing as well. (ST 1a 14.1c)\n\n\nSuch forms, received intentionally in the external senses, are known\nas sensible species. Received in the internal senses, they are known\nas phantasms. Received in the intellect, they are known as\nintelligible species. Such forms\u2014for instance, the sensible\nspecies of heat\u2014are that in virtue of which we perceive, for\ninstance, the heat of external bodies. That such forms do not make\npossessor actually hot (etc.) is perhaps just what it is for a form to\nexist intentionally. But there is scholarly disagreement over what it\nmeans to say that such forms are \u201cspiritual\u201d and\n\u201cimmaterial\u201d (Hoffman 2014).\n\nAs these passages make clear, perception (and cognition in general)\nworks through the reception of the very form of the thing that is\nbeing perceived. This has led to much discussion over whether Aquinas\nthereby subscribes to a strong form of direct realism, according to\nwhich what we perceive (and what we think about) is the thing itself.\nIn favor of this reading is that Aquinas seems entirely unconcerned\nabout these intentionally existing species as intermediaries lying\nbetween us and the things themselves. Why should he be concerned, the\nthought goes, since the species just is the form itself of the thing\nout in the world? (see Perler 2000; B\u0103ltu\u021b\u0103 2013)\nAgainst this reading is that the species (of heat, say) is not\nnumerically the same form as the one that inheres in the fire, and\nthat Aquinas does, at least sometimes, seem to think of these species\nas representations that mediate our access to external things (Pasnau\n1997 ch. 3; Panaccio 2001; see also Brower and Brower-Toland\n2008).\n",
