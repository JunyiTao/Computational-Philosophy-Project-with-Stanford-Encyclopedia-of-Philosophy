    "main_text": "Bodies and Magnitudes || Infinity and the Shape of the Cosmos\n2.4 Infinity and the Shape of the Cosmos\n\nWith the introduction of continuity and its corresponding notion of\ninfinite divisibility one is also obliquely introduced to the notion\nof infinity (l\u0101 nih\u0101ya). Avicenna, following\nAristotle\u2019s account of the infinite (apeiron) at\nPhysics, 3.6, defines it as \u201cthat which whatever you\ntake from it\u2014and any of the things equal to that thing you took\nfrom it\u2014you [always] find something outside of it\u201d\n(Avicenna, [Ph], 3.7 [2]). In natural philosophy, the immediate issue\nis whether an infinity exists either in quantities that posses some\nposition or in numbers in an ordered series (Avicenna, [Ph], 3.7 [1]).\nThe mutakallim\u016bn, that is, the proponents of Kal\u0101m, were for\nthe most part opposed to predicating the infinite of anything other\nthan God. This opposition included both actual infinity and potential\ninfinity, as we have seen. While it is notoriously difficult to give a\nprecise account of the difference between the actual as opposed to the\npotential infinite, a rough characterization is this: In the case of\nan actually infinite magnitude, all the parts of that magnitude are\nsomehow simultaneously and fully present, whereas in the case of the\npotentially infinite there is an going process or succession in which\nthe units come to be, never wholly existing as actual at some given\npoint or moment. While Avicenna happily accepts the reality of\npotential infinities, he denies that there are material instances of\neither actually infinite qualities, like infinitely large bodies, or\nnumbers, like infinitely large sets of bodies, all of which exist\n simultaneously.[6]\n\nAvicenna has a number of arguments attempting to show that an actual\ninfinity in nature is impossible (for a presentation and assessment of\nsome of these arguments see Zarepour 2020). These arguments can be\ndivided into those that appeal to motion as part of the proof, and\nthose that do not appeal to motion. Here I merely consider one of\nAvicenna\u2019s non-motion proofs against an actual (spatial)\ninfinity. The argument, which I present, is not the preferred proof in\neither The Cure or The Salvation, although he had\ntoyed with it in The Cure (Avicenna, [Ph], 3.8 [5\u20137]).\nStill it is his preferred and indeed only argument against an actual\ninfinity in his shorter and last philosophical encyclopedia,\nPointers and Reminders (Avicenna, [PR], nama\u1e6d\n1, ch. 11, p.\n 183\u201390).[7]\n Moreover, the proof is a uniquely Avicennan one.\n\nThe argument asks one to posit some actually infinite ray, AB and then\nanother actually infinite ray, AC, so as to form an acute angle\n\u2220BAC. Next Avicenna asks one to consider the gap, BC, between the\ntwo rays. The farther from A that BC is, the larger BC becomes. Since\nthe two rays are actually infinitely extended, BC should, in\nprinciple, also be actually infinite; however, BC always lies between\nAB and AC and of necessity terminates at them, so BC is finite. Thus,\nthere is a contradiction: BC is both finite and infinite and, claims\nAvicenna, what produced the contradiction is the assumption that there\nis actually infinite space. Whether Avicenna\u2019s new argument is\nsuccessful became a matter of intense debate in post-classical Islamic\nnatural philosophy, with such notables as Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t\nal-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (1080\u20131165) and Najm al-D\u012bn\nal-K\u0101tib\u012b al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b (ca. 1203\u20131277) finding\nit wanting, whereas Na\u1e63\u012br al-D\u012bn\nal-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b (1201\u20131274) and Mull\u0101\n\u1e62adr\u0101 (1571\u20131636) considered it defensible (McGinnis\n2018).\n\nAvicenna\u2019s arguments against an actual infinity in nature are in\ngeneral all directed against the possibility of infinite spatial\nmagnitude. Consequently, since space must be finite (i.e., limited),\nall bodies must be limited, and in being limited they have shape. This\nconclusion holds for the cosmos as a whole as well. As for the shape\nof the cosmos, while such a topic takes us slightly afield from a\ndiscussion of infinity, it does round out Avicenna\u2019s abstract\ndiscussion of body. For a number of reasons, Avicenna thinks that the\nshape of the cosmos must be spherical. While in some ways Avicenna\ntakes this claim to be a matter of empirical observation, he also\nargues that since the nature of the heavenly bodies is completely\nhomogeneous and unvarying, there cannot be dissimilarities in a\nheavenly body such that a part of it would be angular and another part\nrectilinear or such that part of it has one sort of curve and another\npart a different sort (Avicenna, [DC], 3; also Avicenna, [Ph], 1.8 [2]\nprovides the general argument, albeit there it is applied to showing\nthe sphericity of the Earth). Inasmuch as the cosmos is spherical, it\nmust have some center, which, at least from the point of physics,\nAvicenna identifies with the Earth. (Strictly speaking the Earth is a\nbit off center in accordance with the demands of the Ptolemaic\nastronomy, which Avicenna adopts.)\n\nWe thus now have a general picture of Avicenna\u2019s conception of\nbody in the abstract. Body is not composed of conceptually indivisible\natoms but must be continuous and finite. In the next section I briefly\nconsider body not in the abstract, but particular kinds of bodies,\nnamely, the so-called elements.\n",
