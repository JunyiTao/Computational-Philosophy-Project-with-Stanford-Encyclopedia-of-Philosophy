    "main_text": "Conceptual Matters || Obligation: Political, Legal, and Civil\n2.2 Obligation: Political, Legal, and Civil\n\nOne question that immediately arises from this conception of political\nobligation is whether \u201cpolitical\u201d is the appropriate\nmodifier. If the obligation in question is a duty to obey the law,\nthen why not call it a legal obligation? The answer is that\n\u201clegal obligation\u201d has a different kind of work to do. For\nmany legal philosophers, the claim that a person has a legal\nobligation to do X is merely a descriptive claim, a statement of\nsocial fact [see the entry on Legal Positivism]. The fact that a\nperson has a legal obligation to do X provides him with a moral reason\nto do X only if he has a moral duty obey the law; that is, a political\nobligation. The value of this distinction is that it allows one to\nhold that a person may be subject to a legal obligation even though\nshe has no political obligation to obey the laws of the regime in\npower. Suppose that the regime is tyrannical, inept, or simply so\nunjust that only a Hobbesian would maintain that those subject to its\ncommands have a moral obligation to obey. Nevertheless, most theorists\nwill agree that people in this unhappy country have legal obligations\nto pay taxes, refrain from certain types of conduct when driving, and\ndo whatever the legal system that enjoys de facto jurisdiction over\nthem requires; that is, claims to this effect are true descriptions of\nthe world. But such descriptions are compatible with the belief that\nthe people of unhappy countries have no moral duty to act as the law\ndirects simply because the law so directs.\n\nBhikhu Parekh (1993, p. 240) employs the phrase \u201ccivil\nobligation\u201d to refer to \u201cthe obligation to respect and\nuphold the legitimately constituted civil authority,\u201d from which\nfollows a moral obligation \u201cto obey the laws enacted by the\ncivil authority.\u201d \u201cPolitical\u201d is a broader term,\naccording to Parekh, and someone who has a truly political obligation\nwill owe her polity more than mere obedience to its laws, such as a\npositive duty to take steps to secure the safety and advance the\ninterests of her country. (see also Raz 2006, p. 1004). Yet we already\nhave a term, \u201ccivic duty,\u201d that does the work Parekh wants\nto assign to \u201cpolitical obligation.\u201d Exhortations to do\nour civic duty typically urge us to do more than merely obey the\nlaw. These exhortations would have us vote in elections and be\nwell-informed voters; buy government bonds; limit our use of water and\nother scarce resources; donate blood, service, or money (beyond what\nwe owe in taxes) in times of crisis; and generally contribute in an\nactive way to the common good. Whether we really have a civic duty to\ndo any or all of these things may be a matter of dispute, but appeals\nto civic duty are certainly quite common, and it is hardly clear that\nthere is something to be gained by reclassifying them as appeals to\npolitical obligation.\n\nWe now turn to the question of whether we should distinguish the\nconcept of political obligation from that of a duty to obey the law.\n The answer may depend on whether we understand the term\n\u201cpolitical\u201d to refer to the status in virtue of which a\nperson has the obligation or to the entity or agent to whom she owes\nit. In the former case, political obligation refers to those\nobligations a person has as a member or citizen of a particular\npolity. So understood, a theory of political obligation will tell us\nnothing about the authority a state enjoys over non-members; for\nexample, whether and why short-term visitors residing on its territory\nhave a duty to obey its laws. That need not render it defective as an\naccount of political obligation, but it does entail that we should not\ntake the phrase \u201cpolitical obligation\u201d to be synonymous\nwith the phrase \u201ca duty to obey the law\nsimpliciter,\u201d but only with the phrase \u201ca\ncitizen\u2019s (or member\u2019s) duty to obey the law.\u201d In\ncontrast, if \u201cpolitical\u201d refers to the agent or entity to\nwhom a person owes the obligation, then a theory of political\nobligation will be synonymous with a theory of the duty to obey the\nlaw, since it will aspire to explain why those who are subject to a\nparticular state\u2019s jurisdiction, be they citizens or foreigners,\nhave a moral duty to act as it directs them to act. Arguably, certain\nsolutions to the problem of political obligation fare better when\n\u201cpolitical\u201d refers to the status in virtue of which a\nperson has the obligation than when it refers to the entity to which\nshe owes it, or vice versa. For example, membership or associative\napproaches to political obligation may have a leg up in justifying\ncitizens\u2019 duties to obey the law but face a significant\nchallenge in accounting for the obligation of foreigners to do so (see\n\u00a74.3). Conversely, natural duty theories may be able to explain\nwhy anyone, citizen or not, has a duty to obey the law (i.e., the laws\nof one or another legal system) but struggle to explain why anyone has\na duty to obey the laws of the particular state of which she is a\nmember (see the discussion of particularity at the end of \u00a7 2.3;\nsee also \u00a74.4). Attention to the ambiguity in the referent of the\nterm \u201cpolitical\u201d may also support a pluralistic or\nmulti-principle solution to the problem of political obligation; e.g.,\na membership justification for the duty of citizens to obey the law,\nand a consent justification for the duty of foreigners to do so (see\n\u00a75).\n",
