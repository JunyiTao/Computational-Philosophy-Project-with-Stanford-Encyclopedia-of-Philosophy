    "main_text": "\n1. The Tradition Analytic Feminists Share with Other Analytic Philosophers\n\nContemporary analytic philosophers, feminist and nonfeminist, can be\ncharacterized roughly as follows: they consider (some of)\n Frege,\n Russell,\n Moore,\n Wittgenstein, and the\n Logical Positivists\n to be their intellectual ancestors; they tend to prize explicit\nargumentation and the literal, precise, and clear use of language;\nthey often value the roles of philosophy of language, epistemology,\nand logic; and they typically view their stock of philosophical\nconcepts, methods, and assumptions to be a) consistent with their\nModern European heritage, and b) in contrast with methods originating\nin continental Europe since 1900, from phenomenology and\nexistentialism through poststructuralism and new materialism.\n\nOf course, each strand of mid-twentieth-century, \u201cclassic\u201d\nanalytic philosophy has changed greatly. Many central dogmas have been\nundermined, and nonfeminists and feminists alike have\n\u201cnaturalized\u201d, \u201csocialized\u201d, and otherwise\nmodulated the earlier, more abstract and highly normative enterprises\nand doctrines. However, regardless of the extent of the evolution of\n\u201canalytic philosophy\u201d, the degree to which methodological\nboundaries are blurred today, and the fruitfulness of intersections\namong methods, a number of feminist and nonfeminist philosophers\ncontinue to think of themselves in the historical trajectory of\nanalytic philosophy and find the tradition valuable. They claim the\nterm \u201canalytic philosopher\u201d for themselves, even if others\nmight prefer the term\n \u201cpost-analytic\u201d.[2]\n2. What Analytic Feminists Share with Other Feminist Philosophers\n\nOne way to encapsulate the agreement in positions and values among\nfeminist philosophers, regardless of their methodological\ninclinations, is to say that for feminist philosophers, both\nphilosophy and gender matter\u2014both are important to the\nlives of human beings. Feminists recognize that philosophy and\nphilosophers are part of the wider set of institutions of culture in\nwhich human beings live, understand themselves, and, only sometimes,\nflourish. Among the many functions of philosophy are the following: to\nhelp us to understand ourselves and our relations to each other, to\nour communities, and to the state; to appreciate the extent to which\nwe are counted as knowers and moral agents; to uncover the assumptions\nand methods of various bodies of knowledge, and so on. These kinds of\nphilosophical insights\u2014ones that concern our methods,\nassumptions, theories, and concepts\u2014can contribute to the\noppression of human beings as well as to their liberation (see, for\nexample, Langton 2000\u00a0and Vogler 1995). Given the current\nimbalances of power and privilege with which people live, philosophy\nhas social effects when it \u201cleaves everything as it is\u201d.\nWhen feminist philosophers say that traditional philosophy is already\npolitical, they are calling attention to these social effects.\nFeminists seek \u201cengaged\u201d philosophy that is potentially\nuseful to empower human beings rather than contribute to the\nperpetuation of a status quo in which people are subordinated by\ngender, race/ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, and so on. Of\ncourse, feminist philosophers disagree about the appropriate ways to\nwork this out, but they do agree that philosophy can influence lives\nand should influence them for the better.\n\nA second area of agreement among feminist philosophers is that gender\naffects not only our lives, but also philosophy itself. Feminists\ncriticize the misogyny of philosophers and the overt and covert\nsexism, androcentrism, and related forms of male bias in philosophy.\nFor example, philosophers have through the centuries made a variety of\nfalse and demeaning claims about \u201cthe nature of woman\u201d;\nthey have defined central concepts such as reason in ways that\nexcluded women of their cultures; they have made allegedly universal\nclaims about human nature, desire, or motivation that were, in fact,\nclaims more likely to be true of men of their own social class; and\nthey have believed methods and positions to be\n\u201cvalue-neutral\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d that were\ninstead promoting the interests of only the privileged groups. Once\nagain, while feminist philosophers agree on the existence of such\nkinds of male bias, they differ over the best ways to criticize it,\nthe extent to which various philosophical approaches can be\nreconstructed for feminist use, and so on. We turn to examples in\nsections five through seven below.\n\nFeminist philosophers argue that the kinds of male-biased views just\nnoted limit and distort philosophy on many levels\u2014from\nindividual concepts such as reason or autonomy to entire fields such\nas philosophy of mind. The remedy for these distortions and\nlimitations is not to substitute \u201cfemale bias\u201d for\n\u201cmale bias\u201d, but to understand the variety of roles that\ngender plays in the construction of philosophy. Feminists believe that\neven as philosophers pursue their traditional goals, the likelihood of\nprogress toward them is increased by heeding feminists\u2019 more\ninclusive and self-reflexive approach.\n\nIt is important to be clear that feminist philosophers realize that\ntraditional philosophy has been written largely by men who are\nprivileged in ways that go far beyond their gender. Feminists today\nmaintain that gender is only one facet of a complex nexus of mutually\ninfluencing axes of oppression and privilege that structure society\nand the social identities of human beings; other facets include\nrace/ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, class, and so on.\nFeminist philosophers doing \u201cintersectional analysis\u201d try\nto attend to this complexity. Although gender is only one facet, it is\nnevertheless an important one with a wide variety of implications for\nthe way we should do philosophy. Most feminists share points in common\nas they continue to critique other philosophers as well as try to\nreconstruct philosophy that is neither male-biased nor oppressive in\nany other respect. Let\u2019s briefly note a few of these points\nbefore moving on to disagreements.\n\nSince many traditional philosophers believe that their own\ntheories or methods have universal applicability, feminists find it\nappropriate to hold these philosophers\u2019 feet to the fire.\nFeminists explain that part of what it means for a moral theory or an\nepistemology to be universal is that it must be applicable to and\nusable by a full range of human beings, not just to and by members of\na dominant social group. For example, a moral theory should allow for\nmoral agency for any person regardless of social status and specific\ncomplex identity. An epistemological theory should be able to analyze\nfairly a full range of cognitive situations of a wide variety of human\nbeings. A good philosophical theory or method would systematically\ndisadvantage no one: men, women\u2014whether cis or\ntransgender\u2014as well as nonbinary individuals from any social\ngroup. For example, it would disparage no one\u2019s experiences, no\none\u2019s authority as a knower, and no one\u2019s goals as a moral\nor political agent. Such an approach postulates neither the\n\u201csameness\u201d of everyone nor the existence of \u201cgroup\ndifferences\u201d. Instead, it asks that philosophers attend to the\nfull range of human beings, including their wide variety of\nexperiences, interests and situations, when purporting to construct\n\u201cuniversally applicable\u201d theories.\nIt is dangerous to stop paying attention to gender too soon. Even\nif a feminist philosopher has a long-term goal of minimizing the\nimportance of gender, there is a risk of leaving too much unanalyzed\nif one leaps immediately from male-biased philosophy to gender-neutral\nphilosophy. Attention to the influence of gender implies a recognition\nthat philosophy is embedded in social structures and practices, so\nfeminist philosophers tend to use \u201cnaturalized\u201d or\n\u201csocialized\u201d methods to explain the \u201clocated\u201d\nor \u201csituated\u201d character of the subject who does philosophy\nas well as the objects of philosophical reflection. Of course, the\ndetails here vary widely among feminists. A related notion,\n\u201cnonideal\u201d philosophy (Mills 2005), is embraced by many\nfeminists who express the desire to produce philosophy that is\ngrounded in the material world full of human beings and institutions,\nall of which are flawed in very complex ways.\nPhilosophy must be normative at the same time it includes a\nnaturalized or socialized component. Feminist philosophers, like many\nnonfeminist philosophers, struggle to maintain the level of\nnormativity that they require in order to serve their philosophical\nand political goals. Again, details will vary concerning what level or\nkind of normativity is necessary.\n\n\nAlthough we return later to controversial aspects of these points,\nfeminist consensus is that although philosophy is a discipline that\npurports to be about and for all humanity, it has not been.\nPhilosophers have not appreciated the extent to which their theories\nand methods have underwritten and perpetuated cultures that have\nprevented the flourishing of at least half of their populations.\nPhilosophy that reflects a feminist sensibility would take account of\nthe relevance of philosophy to the lives of all human beings and\npromote the flourishing of every person. At the same time it would\nhelp philosophy to more nearly approximate its own ideals.\n3. Various Ways to Characterize Differences Among Feminist Philosophers\n\nAlthough an essay on analytic feminism focuses our attention on\ndifferences among philosophical methods that feminists favor, these\ndistinctions were not salient in the early days of contemporary\nfeminist philosophy in the 1970s. Even during the 1980s and 1990s when\nmethodological and other differences came under more scrutiny, the\nquestion of whether a feminist philosopher finds more valuable\nresources in analytic philosophy or in pragmatism, poststructuralism,\nphenomenology, Marxism, critical theory, or hermeneutics was of more\nconcern to certain academic feminist philosophers than it was to the\nwider feminist scholarly or political communities. In fact, academic\nfeminist philosophers in many parts of the world report taking less\nnote of feminists\u2019 methodological distinctions than do feminist\nphilosophers in North\n America.[3]\n\nToday, although many feminist philosophers\u2019 mainstream\nphilosophical education still often focuses on one philosophical\nmethod or tradition, one can find \u201canalytic feminists\u201d\ndiscussing Beauvoir, Foucault, or Butler without hesitation. It is\nfair to say that because of feminist philosophers\u2019 political\nvalues and desire to communicate with other feminists, they are more\nmotivated to search for methodological cross-fertilization than are\nmany nonfeminist philosophers. (See the entries on\n intersections between pragmatist and Continental feminism\n and\n intersections between analytic and Continental feminism.)\n\nThe categories of feminist philosophies/theories most widely known\noutside academic philosophy since the 1970s are those developed by\nAlison Jaggar based on political values, goals, and assumptions.\nJaggar distinguishes liberal, radical, classical Marxist, and\nsocialist feminism. Each kind of feminism identifies the principal\nsources of women\u2019s oppression and encompasses an epistemology\nand a theory of human nature as well as political theory and\nstrategies for social change\n (1983)[4]\n It is very important to note that some women of color have long\nobjected to the widespread and hegemonic use of these categories (see\nSandoval 1991, 2000). In addition, because the categories are based in\npolitical theories, it is not surprising that they function better in\nsocial/political theorizing both in and outside of philosophy than for\nphilosophers doing metaphysics, philosophy of science, aesthetics, and\nso on.\n\nSandra Harding developed a different widely used set of categories of\nfeminist philosophies in the context of philosophy of science and\nepistemology (1986). Harding distinguishes feminist empiricists\n(practicing natural and social scientists who tended to rely on\nlogical positivist theories), feminist standpoint theorists who drew\nfrom Marxist epistemology, and feminist postmodernists. Although\nHarding is distinguishing feminists by philosophical methodology, it\nis important to emphasize that her category of \u201cfeminist\nempiricist\u201d captures a trend among pathbreaking women scientists\nwho aimed to hold scientific practice to alleged standards of\nscientific objectivity and neutrality; however, the assumptions behind\nthis trend are not what philosophers today have in mind when speaking\nof feminist empiricism. Contemporary analytic feminist empiricist\nphilosophers tend to be post-Wittgensteinian-Quinean-Davidsonian\nempiricists, so not subject to the principal objections Harding raised\nof the scientists. See, for example, Longino (1990, 2002), Nelson\n(1990), Solomon (2001), E. Lloyd (2008), as well as essays collected\nin Scheman and O\u2019Connor (2002), Nelson and Nelson (2003), Clough\n(2003), Superson and Brennan (2005), Grasswick (2011), Crasnow and\nSuperson (2012), and Garavaso (2018).\n\nAs we will see in more detail below, analytic feminists are among\nthose who argue that they are not captured by either Jaggar\u2019s or\nHarding\u2019s sets of categories. The analytic feminists who\ndistinguish their philosophical method from their political values and\nassumptions would reject, for example, a necessary connection between\nbeing either an analytic philosopher or an empiricist and being a\n liberal.[5]\n4. Characteristics of Analytic Feminism\n\nAlthough there had been feminist philosophers using analytic methods\nsince the late 1960s, as feminist philosophy developed in the areas of\nepistemology, philosophy of science, and metaphysics there were\nclusters of controversies over the compatibility of feminist politics\nwith a preference for analytic philosophical methods. Panels at\nAmerican Philosophical Association meetings and discussions at the\nSociety for Women in Philosophy generated essays that explored these\nmatters. See, for example, issues of The APA Newsletter on\nFeminism and Philosophy (Tuana 1992; Meyers & Antony\n1993).\n\nThe term \u201canalytic feminist\u201d came into use in the early\n1990s in North America. Virginia Klenk proposed a Society for\nAnalytical Feminism (see\n Other Internet Resources)\n in 1991 and was its first president (Cudd & Norlock 2018 recount\nthe story). Ann Cudd characterized analytic feminism on the\norganization\u2019s website (see Cudd 1996 [2006) and in a special\nissue of Hypatia on Analytic Feminism (Cudd & Klenk\n1995). She notes that there is at best a family resemblance among\nanalytic feminists. Among the characteristics she cites are the\nfollowing:\n\n\nAnalytic feminism holds that the best way for scholars to counter\nsexism and androcentrism is through forming a clear conception of and\npursuing truth, logical consistency, objectivity, rationality,\njustice, and the good while recognizing that these notions have often\nbeen perverted by androcentrism throughout the history of philosophy\n\u2026. Analytic feminism holds that many traditional philosophical\nnotions are not only normatively compelling, but also in some ways\nempowering and liberating for women. While postmodern feminism rejects\nthe universality of truth, justice and objectivity and the univocality\nof \u201cwomen\u201d, analytic feminism defends these notions. (Cudd\n1996 [2006: 158])\n\n\nAs we flesh out the family resemblances among analytic feminists it is\nimportant to remember that these resemblances include not only\nsubstantive positions, but also styles of presentation and other\npractices. Further, as we have already noted in the first two\nsections, analytic feminists share resemblances with others in their\neven larger \u201cfamily\u201d that includes both non-analytic\nfeminists and nonfeminist analytic philosophers. A large and diverse\nfamily indeed!\n4.1 Doctrines, Desires, and Tools\n\nAlthough Cudd lists a few traditional concepts that analytic feminists\nwant to retain, she makes clear that this is no manifesto. Many who\nconsider themselves feminists in the analytic tradition hold that\nthere are no doctrines required of analytic feminists; indeed, there\nis even a spirit of contrarianism about such matters, including over\n\u201cthe univocality of \u2018women.\u2019\u201d Nevertheless,\nanalytic feminists share something that we might call a core\ndesire rather than a core doctrine, namely, the desire to retain\nenough of the central normative concepts of the modern European\ntradition to support the kind of normativity required by both feminist\npolitics and philosophy. For example, they believe that feminist\npolitics requires that claims about oppression or denial of rights be\ntrue or false and able to be justified and that philosophy requires\nmuch the same thing.\n\nThis \u201ccore desire\u201d finds its expression, for example, in\nthe ways analytic feminists use some of what we might call the\n\u201ccore concepts\u201d that Cudd mentions above: truth, logical\nconsistency, objectivity, rationality and justice. Although, as noted\nin the\n section 1\n above, analytic feminists agree with other feminist philosophers that\nimportant facets of these concepts are male-biased, analytic feminists\ndefend the concepts in ways that other feminists do not. At\nthe same time analytic feminists disagree among themselves about a\nnumber of matters, for example, what kinds of accounts of truth or\nobjectivity should prevail or whether scientific realism or\nanti-realism is a better strategy. We will spell out some of these\ndetails later as we discuss analytic feminists\u2019 defense of\nanalytic philosophy in the sixth section, on\n analytic feminists\u2019 responses to critiques.\n\nPieranna Garavaso\u2019s 2018 characterization of analytic feminism\nrecasts core concepts or desires in terms of toolkits and ways of\nreading:\n\n\nAnalytic feminists are philosophers who use methodological approaches\noften learned while training in analytic philosophy\u2014that is, the\never-expanding toolkit that may include such instruments as conceptual\nand logical analysis, use of argumentation, thought experiments,\ncounterexamples, and so forth\u2014and who read classical and\ncontemporary philosophical texts through a filter that highlights the\nexistence and the effects of various systems of social inequality such\nas gender, race, class, physical and mental abilities, and sexual\norientation. (Garavaso 2018: 8)\n\n4.2 Bridge Building\n\nAnalytic feminists\u2019 use of these toolkits and concepts and their\nfeminist reading of the work of traditional analytic philosophers\nallow them to converse with and build bridges among different groups\nof scholars, for example, traditional analytic philosophers, other\nfeminist philosophers, and, in some cases, scientists or scholars in\nsocial studies of science. This is sometimes an explicit goal of their\nwork (see Fricker and Hornsby 2000, 4\u20135 and Superson 2011), but\nis more often implied. Two analytic feminist philosophers of science\nfor whom this is an explicit goal are Lynn Hankinson Nelson and Helen\nLongino. Nelson sees her work in feminist empiricism that builds upon\nQuine as a way to engage philosophers of science, scientists and\nfeminists in constructive conversation (Nelson 1990 and subsequent\nessays, e.g., 1996). Longino, in The Fate of Knowledge (2002)\ntakes bold steps to dissolve the rational-social dichotomy by\nuntangling the assumptions made by social and cultural studies of\nscience scholars, historians and philosophers of science, and\nscientists. Interestingly, Longino\u2019s 2002 and 2013 books are not\ncast in \u201cfeminist\u201d terms, but build on her overtly\nfeminist work from the 1980s and 1990s and are informed by many\ndecades of feminist philosophy conversations.\n\nAnalytic feminists\u2019 styles of writing also have implications for\nbridge building. Because analytic feminists value explicit\nargumentation and clear, literal, and precise uses of language their\nwork \u201clooks like philosophy\u201d to nonfeminist analytic\nphilosophers; it makes nonfeminist philosophers feel more comfortable\nengaging in feminist discussion. At the same time, feminist\nphilosophers from various philosophical traditions often engage with\neach other\u2019s work outside their own \u201cpreferred\nmethod\u201d because of feminists\u2019 shared values and goals.\nThus non-analytic feminists who might find an analytic writing style\ntediously overqualified or otherwise confining still\nengage\u2014along with nonfeminist analytic philosophers\u2014in\nfruitful bridge-building conversations. Editors of analytic feminist\nanthologies and special issues of journals often have explicit\nbridge-building intentions that rest both on authors\u2019 style and\n content.[6]\n Examples of anthologies and journal issues that tie well with\ntraditional analytic philosophy are Antony and Witt (1993 [2002]),\nCudd and Klenk (1995), Haslanger (1995a), Fricker and Hornsby (2000),\nSuperson and Brennan (2005), Crasnow and Superson (2012), and Garavaso\n(2018); examples of books or symposia that intentionally build bridges\nacross feminist methods include Superson (2003), Witt (2011b), Garry,\nKhader, and Stone (2017).\n4.3 Style and Aggression\n\nAlthough arguing explicitly is not to be equated with arguing\naggressively or in an adversarial manner, analytic feminists have\naddressed the issue of stylistic aggressiveness. We must distinguish\ntwo related issues on this subject: first, an aggressive manner of\narguing in general, and second, Janice Moulton\u2019s critique of the\n\u201cadversary method\u201d as a paradigm in philosophy\u2014and\nspecifically in analytic philosophy (1983). Moulton\u2019s point is\nnot simply that the socially constructed belief that aggression is an\nunladylike/unfeminine characteristic puts women at a disadvantage\n(indeed, in a double bind) in careers such as philosophy that equate\naggression with competence. She also focuses on the ways in which the\nuse of the adversary method as a paradigm of philosophy limits and\ndistorts the work of philosophers.\n\nMoulton uses \u201cthe adversary method\u201d to refer to the view\nof philosophy in which the philosopher\u2019s task is to develop\ngeneral claims, produce counterexamples to each other\u2019s general\nclaims, and use only deductive reasoning (1983: 152\u2013153). If\nthis is the paradigm of philosophy rather than simply one strategy\namong many, then the discipline excludes many fruitful kinds of\nexploration and development, distorts the history of philosophy, and\n(because it works best in well-defined areas, even isolated arguments)\ngreatly narrows the scope of philosophical concerns. Moulton also sees\nintegrated into this paradigm several ideals of which she is critical,\nfor example, \u201cvalue-free\u201d reasoning and objectivity.\nInterestingly, she does not draw illustrations from the obvious\nexamples in analytic philosophy such as Edmund Gettier\u2019s\nanalysis of \u201cS knows that p\u201d and the decades\nof responses to it. Instead she uses an early feminist essay, Judith\nThomson\u2019s \u201cA Defense of Abortion\u201d (1971), to show\nways in which important facets of a substantive issue can be set aside\nbecause of restrictions imposed by the adversary method.\n\nI know of no feminist who has argued in print against Moulton\u2019s\nspecific argument opposing the adversary method, although some have\nmade further distinctions (for example, Govier 1999\u00a0and Rooney\n2010). Nevertheless, some analytic feminists have pointed to the value\nof arguing aggressively in general. For example, Louise Antony values\nthe gender transgression and feelings of empowerment and freedom that\ncan stem from a woman\u2019s using an aggressive analytic style of\nwriting and argument (Antony 2003, see also Baber 1993). More recent\ntreatments of aggressive or adversarial styles have arisen in\ndiscussions of the persistently low number of women in philosophy,\ncompared with other humanistic disciplines (see, for example, Burrow\n2010, Rooney 2010, Beebee 2014, and for a differing view that centers\nBlack women, see Henning 2018, 2020). This issue is not one that finds\nanalytic feminists (or any others) in unanimity. Underlying the\ndisagreement over style are important shared goals: to offer clear,\nrational support for feminist positions and to remain respectful of\nthe other person while disagreeing. Feminist philosophers find the\nlatter to be especially important, but peculiarly elusive, when they\nare disagreeing among themselves. The parameters of respectful\ndisagreement have engendered interesting\n debate.[7]\n4.4 Reconstructing Philosophy\n\nWe noted in the\n second section\n that feminist philosophers with a variety of methodological and\npolitical backgrounds would agree that if a philosopher\nclaims universal applicability for a theory or method, it must be\nusable by people of any gender from a variety of complex social\nlocations. Many analytic feminists use a similar approach to the\nconstruction of feminist philosophy. They tend to be wary of\ncreating specialized fields/types of philosophy that are relevant only\nto (some or all) women or feminists, for example, ethics or\nepistemology that is only for lesbians or is\n\u201cgynocentric\u201d. Analytic feminists tend to propose that\nfeminist ethics or feminist metaphysics would instead establish new\ncriteria of adequacy for ethics or metaphysics. The authors\nin The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy provide\nexcellent examples of this approach (Fricker & Hornsby 2000). This\napproach can be spelled out in terms similar to some used in\n Section 2:\n An adequate philosophical theory, method or concept is one that\n\u201cworks\u201d for women as well as everyone else.\n\u201cWorks\u201d is very inclusive here: it cannot be enmeshed in a\nphilosophical system that has oppressive consequences large or small;\nits theories and concepts must reflect and be applicable to the full\nrange of experiences, interests, and situations of all sorts of women,\nmen, and nonbinary people. Note that this view requires no commitment\nto claims about feminist standpoints, nor does it treat women as a\nuniform class of any kind. It is obvious that experiences vary\naccording to a number of different axes\u2014not only along the\ncommonly cited axes of social class, sexual orientation,\nrace/ethnicity, physical or mental abilities, and gender\u2014but\nalso in terms of individual variation as well as other general\nfactors. This approach leaves open many substantive questions about\nthe long-term interests of different individuals and groups. It also\npermits one to point out the importance of having a variety of\nperspectives without maintaining that there is something\n\u201cessential\u201d about these perspectives.\n\nAs analytic feminism has become an increasingly developed field, its\npractitioners have expanded the range of resources upon which they\ndraw as they reconstruct philosophy. Some analytic feminists alongside\nothers pursuing engaged scholarship, have argued that traditional\nphilosophy and feminist philosophy alike need to reflect the\ncomplexities of intersectional analyses of gender, race/ethnicity,\nsexuality, disability, class, and so on (Bailey 2010 and Garry 2012\ntook particular aim at analytic feminists in their arguments for\nintersectionality). Philosophers need to draw on feminist critical\nrace theory, critical disability studies, and queer and trans theory\nto enrich their understanding of the ways in which various axes of\noppression and privilege intermesh.\n\nReconstructing philosophy also requires understanding the roles that\nprivilege and oppression play in the widespread construction of\nepistemic ignorance and in practices that result in epistemic\ninjustice and epistemic oppression. A rapidly growing body of\nliterature in the twenty-first century, for example, Miranda Fricker\n(2007) and Kristie Dotson (2011, 2014) as well as multiple authors in\nNancy Tuana and Shannon Sullivan (2006),in Sullivan and Tuana (2007),\nand in Ian Kidd, Jos\u00e9 Medina, and Gaile Pohlhaus (2017) call to\nour attention both the depth with which privilege has been constructed\nand the ways its tentacles reach into multiple facets of our epistemic\nand moral\n lives.[8]See\n entry on\n feminist social epistemology\n for more detailed discussion.\n5. Twentieth Century Feminist Criticism of Analytic Philosophy\n\nAlthough every philosophical method is subject to feminist critique,\n\u201cclassic\u201d analytic philosophy might seem to be a paradigm\ncase of \u201cmale-biased philosophy\u201d\u2014a kind of\nphilosophy least hospitable to feminist values. Among the features\nthat feminists have criticized are that it is committed to pure\nobjectivity and value-neutrality, and uses an unlocated, disembodied,\ndisinterested, autonomous individual reasoner, knower, and agent.\nHaving stated it this boldly, let us look briefly at examples of late\ntwentieth-century arguments offered by feminists who themselves had\nanalytic training that became classic critiques of analytic\nphilosophy. In\n Section 6\n we will turn to the responses of other analytic feminists to\nunderstand why they nevertheless find valuable resources in the\nanalytic tradition.\n\nIn some respects it is hard to disentangle feminist\nphilosophers\u2019 critiques of analytic philosophy from their\nbroader critiques of Western thought because sometimes their critique\nof analytic philosophy is supported by their critiques of either its\nantecedents in modern philosophy or its sister scientific disciplines.\nFor example, when Jaggar criticized abstract individualism and other\nconcepts of modern liberal political theory her critique was also\nrelevant to the disinterested, detached investigator prized by the\nlogical positivists. Jaggar faults liberalism for\n\nits normative dualism that arises when the mental capacity for\nrationality is \u201cwhat is especially valuable about human\nbeings\u201d (1983: 40),\nabstract individualism\u2014\u201cthe assumption that the\nessential human characteristics are properties of individuals and are\ngiven independently of any particular social context\u201d (1983:\n42), and\nits assumption that rationality is instrumental, value-neutral,\nand detached.\n\n\nJaggar did not claim that her critique applied to analytic philosophy\nbeyond positivism, but notes that neopositivist values are held in\nnormative theories even in the late twentieth century. She is\nthinking, for example, of political or moral theorists\u2019\ncharacterization of objectivity as impartiality and lack of bias\n(1983: 357).\n\nAmong Sandra Harding\u2019s analyses of the discourses upon which\nfeminists draw, the most relevant to analytic philosophy is her\naccount of empiricism as practiced by natural and social scientists.\nAlthough Harding is speaking about scientists rather than\nphilosophers, her critique of the limitations of the empiricist\nview\u2014especially its assumed account of \u201cvalue-free\u201d\nobjectivity\u2014is also applicable to philosophers who utilize this\nconcept of objectivity. Harding advocates that feminists retain a\nnotion of objectivity that incorporates appropriate values (her\n\u201cstrong objectivity\u201d) and criticizes the\nempiricists\u2019 alleged \u201cvalue-free\u201d objectivity by the\nuse of the arguments below.\n\nIt perpetuates the values of the researchers, and is, in differing\nways, both too narrow and too broad. It is too narrow because it can\ndetect only values that differ between researchers and\n\u201ccompetent\u201d critics, and too broad because it purports to\neliminate all social values, when it may well be that some values\nbenefit science while others undermine it (Harding 1991:\n143\u20134).\nIt is politically and morally regressive; for example, it\nconstructs science in a way that permits scientists to be \u201cfast\nguns for hire\u201d rather than individuals who attend to the moral\nand political values that support and are implied by their actions.\n(Harding 1991: 158\u20139)\nIt is linked to other implausible views. Examples include, first,\nthat only false beliefs have social causes while true beliefs have\nnatural ones, and, second, that the ideal agent must create and\nconstantly police the borders of a gulf, a no-man\u2019s-land,\nbetween himself as the subject and the object of his research,\nknowledge, or action\n\nin order to be \u201ca self whose mind would perfectly reflect the\nworld\u201d (1991: 158). Harding utilizes Nancy Hartsock\u2019s term\n\u201cabstract masculinity\u201d for this last idea (Harding 1991:\n158).\n\n\nNancy Holland utilizes the overlapping critiques of Harding and\nJaggar, particularly that of abstract individualism, and takes them to\nbe telling of Anglo-American philosophy in general (she considers\nLocke and Hume as well as contemporary analytic philosophers to\nexemplify Anglo-American philosophy). Holland focuses on the\nmetaphysical assumptions of empiricism that exclude women from\nphilosophy. She writes that contemporary analytic philosophy,\n\n\nby remaining within the Empiricist tradition, inherits not only the\nproblems of that tradition, but also a self-definition that identifies\nit as necessarily men\u2019s philosophy\u2026. [Men\u2019s]\nphilosophy defines itself throughout its history in such a way as to\nexclude what our culture defines as women\u2019s experience from what\nis considered to be properly philosophical. (1990: 3)\n\n\nAlthough Jane Duran values the rigor of analytic philosophy and wants\nto incorporate it into feminist epistemology, she sees analytic\nepistemology (\u201cpure epistemology\u201d) as a recent incarnation\nof \u201ca masculinist, androcentric tradition that yields a\nhypernormative, idealized, and stylistically aggressive mode of\nthought\u201d (1991: 8). She appeals not only to Harding, but also to\nEvelyn Fox Keller (1985) and Susan Bordo (1987) as well as to Janice\nMoulton\u2019s (1983) critique of the adversary paradigm discussed\nabove in\n Section 4.\n Duran\u2019s examples of traits that have been seen as androcentric\ninclude,\n\n\nanalysis in terms of logically necessary and sufficient conditions,\nlack of allusion to descriptively adequate models, the importance of\ncounterexampling, putative universalization of the conditions, and so\nforth. (1991: 44)\n\n\nNaomi Scheman refers to herself as an \u201canalytic philosopher\nsemi-manqu\u00e9\u201d\u2014one who has left the analytic\nneighborhood of her philosophical training. She has made several kinds\nof arguments that bear on the adequacy of analytic philosophy: the\nimpact of individualism in philosophy of mind, the nature of the self,\nand the nature of the normative philosophical subject (see her papers\ncollected in 1993 and 2011). For example, Scheman argues that it is\nthe ideology of liberal individualism rather than sound argument that\nunderlies the widespread belief that psychological objects such as\n\u201cemotions, beliefs, intentions, virtues, and vices\u201d are\nproperties of individuals (1993: 37). In fact, part of Jaggar\u2019s\nargument against abstract individualism relies on Scheman\u2019s\nconceptual point that questions of identifying and interpreting\npsychological states must be answered in a social context, not in\nabstraction from it. Scheman acknowledges her debt to Wittgenstein in\nmaking this point, but goes beyond his views by arguing that\nwomen\u2019s experiences and psychosexual development do not bear out\nthis kind of individualistic assumption.\n\nIn other essays Scheman argues that the philosophical\n\u201cwe\u201d\u2014the subject who has philosophical\nproblems\u2014is a normative subject, one that bears the\nmarkings of various kinds of privilege. Her examples of normative\nsubjects are the ideally rational scientist or the citizen of a\nliberal state (1993: 7). In this way she shifts her argument away from\nthe experiences and developmental differences between actual men and\nwomen (or between white people/people of color, or other actual\ndifferences of privilege/marginality) in order to focus on the\nconnection between privilege and normativity. If one were to take a\nFreudian-tinted view that philosophical problems are\n\u201cintellectual sublimations of the neuroses of privilege\u201d,\nthen their resolution would come, \u00e0 la Wittgenstein, through\nchanges in our forms of life (1993:\n 8).[9]\n\nLorraine Code is among those who have criticized analytic philosophy\nfor use of a moral-epistemic individual who is \u201cabstract,\n\u2018generalized,\u2019 and disengaged\u201d and a tradition that\nis more concerned with what an ideal agent or knower would do than\nwith a real one (1995: xi). Code uses the example of an\n\u201cS knows that p\u201d epistemology to focus one\nof her most widely known critiques. The knowing subject S, in\nwhat Code hyphenates as the \u201cpositivist-empiricist\u201d\nepistemology, is an individual\u2014a detached, neutral,\ninterchangeable spectator whose knowledge is most reliable when his or\nher sensory observations occur in ideal conditions, not real, everyday\nones. Code argues that \u201cS knows that p\u201d\nmodels of knowledge work only in a prescribed area; indeed, they favor\na narrow kind of scientific knowledge. A more adequate\ncharacterization of knowing must be applicable to a broad range of\nexamples in the lives of real people. In order to do so, it cannot use\nthe interchangeable subject, S, but must include subjective\nfeatures of S such as the person\u2019s identity, interests or\ncircumstances. For without these features we cannot explain complex,\nrelational knowing, for example, knowing a person. In addition, an\nadequate account of knowledge should uncover ways in which political\ninterests are used to determine who is allowed to be a standard\nknower, that is, an S (Code 1991, 1995, 1998). This is only one\nof Code\u2019s early lines of argument against analytic philosophy.\nIn\n Section 7\n we will discuss her arguments that point to the limitations of\nnaturalized epistemology in the analytic style as well.\n\nAs we close our discussion of some of the important classic feminist\ncritiques of analytic philosophy, recall that another criticism was\ndiscussed in\n Section 4:\n Janice Moulton\u2019s critique of the adversary method as a paradigm\nof philosophy. Although use of the adversary method need not be\nlimited to analytic philosophers, Moulton\u2019s critique is clearly\napplicable to widespread practices in twentieth century analytic\nphilosophy.\n6. Analytic Feminists\u2019 Responses to Critiques\n\nThe most frequent kinds of responses by analytic feminists to feminist\ncritiques of analytic philosophy are variations of the following\narguments and claims:\n\nFeminist critiques may have been legitimate for\nsome kinds of analytic philosophy, especially logical positivism, but\nbecause analytic philosophy has changed, the objections do not hold\nfor most contemporary work. The analytic feminist then develops a\nstrand of analytic philosophy that is not subject to a particular kind\nof objection, for example, that knowers are unlocated.\nThere were errors of interpretation in\nfeminists\u2019 critiques, for example, concerning the extent to\nwhich analytic philosophy incorporated empiricism. After correction,\nanalytic philosophy will not be vulnerable to this particular kind of\ncriticism.\nCritics have gone too far in undermining fields of\nphilosophy such as metaphysics and central concepts such as\nrationality. Such fields and concepts are needed both on philosophical\nand feminist grounds.\n\n\nAll three kinds of responses allow analytic feminists to engage in\nactivities on which they thrive\u2014disentangling strands of\nargument from each other, making distinctions among concepts,\nsearching for kernels of truth among points with which they disagree,\nand so on.\n\nResponse (1).\n Regardless of the precise characterization of contemporary analytic\nphilosophy, it clearly cannot to be equated with logical positivism.\nSo to the degree that feminist critiques focus on logical positivism\nrather than current analytic work, they will likely be off the mark.\nAs analytic feminists respond to other feminists\u2019 critiques,\nthey try to decipher which strands of analytic philosophy might be\nmost useful and the degree to which old assumptions and concepts that\nare male-biased still linger. Although some feminists have defended\nfacets of the work of Neurath (Okrulik 2004) and Carnap (Yap 2010) as\nuseful for feminism, most analytic feminists find resources in\nphilosophers who themselves reject central dogmas and methods of\nclassical analytic philosophy, for example,\n Wittgenstein,\n J.L. Austin,\n Quine,\n Davidson, and others.\n\nLet\u2019s take as examples of argument (1) feminists who believe\nthat useful strands of analytic philosophy will be\nnaturalized in some way. We need to cast a wide, permissive\nnet here for what counts as \u201cnaturalized\u201d and to\nacknowledge some controversies over its relation to analytic\nphilosophy and to feminism. As used here, \u201cnaturalized\nphilosophy\u201d includes philosophy that is explicitly informed\nby, rather than replaced by, empirical information about knowers,\nagents, and social structures from psychology/cognitive science,\nsociology, anthropology, and elsewhere. Although most analytic\nfeminists favor \u201cnaturalizing\u201d philosophy (with a strong\npreference for its subcategory of social epistemology), they are\ncritical of many nonfeminist ways of doing\n it.[10]\n\nFor example, the focus in traditional naturalized epistemology on\n\u201cindividual\u201d rather than \u201csocial\u201d sciences\nneglects the \u201csituatedness\u201d of our thinking. A final\ncaveat about terminology: since there is disagreement over the proper\nscope of both \u201cnaturalized\u201d and \u201canalytic\u201d,\nsome will object that naturalized philosophy is not a strand of\nanalytic philosophy at all. For example, Quine, who might be\nconsidered the father of naturalized epistemology, fits squarely into\nour characterization of analytic philosophy; however, Lynn Hankinson\nNelson considers him post-analytic (Nelson and Nelson 2003). And, of\ncourse, there is no necessary link between naturalized philosophy and\nanalytic philosophy in any case; one need only think of Foucault or\nDewey to sever that connection.\n\nKeeping in mind all these caveats and controversies, let\u2019s turn\nto the example of naturalized epistemology to consider what\n\u201cnaturalizing\u201d can do to help feminists overcome\ndifficulties with analytic philosophy. Feminists criticize analytic\nphilosophy for its concepts of a knower (and an agent), for example,\nthat it is an individual who is abstract, idealized,\ninterchangeable, unlocated, disconnected, disembodied, disinterested,\netc. The first thing that naturalized epistemology can do is to shift\nthe focus from the abstract or idealized knower to the concrete facets\nof the person who has beliefs and knowledge. Although this move is not\nin itself feminist, Jane Duran finds it a positive step toward\n\u201cgynocentric\u201d, i.e., woman-centered, epistemology. She\nbelieves that naturalized epistemology\u2014by its descriptive\ncharacter and its concern with the context and details of\nknowing\u2014is capable of including features valued by feminist\nstandpoint epistemology, for example, the relational aspects of\nknowing and the grounding that knowledge has in the body and in\nactivities of daily life (1991: 112, 246). Duran is one of the first\nfeminists who explicitly combined feminist standpoint theory with\nanalytically oriented naturalized epistemology, and is an exception to\nthe widespread tendency of analytic feminists to stay clear of\ngynocentrism. Of course, one need not agree with the specifics of\nDuran\u2019s analysis to appreciate the importance of naturalized\nepistemology\u2019s descriptive attention to context and concrete\ndetails: this descriptive attention allows gender into\nepistemology as facets of the knower and the context become\nrelevant. One can then debate what kinds of social structures,\nindividual variations, and their interactions are fruitful avenues of\nexploration.\n\nA second naturalized approach is Louise Antony\u2019s argument\nconcerning a different aspect of the knower\u2014neutrality. Antony\nmaintains that naturalized epistemology resolves the \u201cparadox of\nbias\u201d (how one can consistently critique male bias and at the\nsame time object to the notion of unbiased, neutral, objective, or\nimpartial knowledge). Naturalized epistemology rejects the ideal of\nneutrality and instead gives us empirical norms by which to\ndifferentiate good from bad biases, that is, biases that lead us\ntoward rather than away from truth (1993 [2002: 113\u2013116,\n 134\u2013144]).[11]\n Antony also engages in many other facets of the debate between\nanalytic and non-analytic feminists to which we will return later.\n\nA third strategy, still within the context of a naturalized\nepistemology/philosophy of science, is to change the relationship\nbetween empiricism and the individual. Lynn Hankinson Nelson and Helen\nLongino are empiricists not in the style of Locke or Hume, but in\ntheir positions that evidence comes from the senses, from\nexperience (Nelson 1990: 21; Longino 1990: 215). This is encapsulated\nby saying that empiricism is a theory of evidence. Using different\nlines of argument, they both shift the focus from the individual to\ncommunities. Nelson argues that communities rather than individuals\n\u201c\u2018acquire\u2019 and possess knowledge\u201d (Nelson\n1990: 14). She wants to use\u00a0both Quinian\u00a0and\u00a0feminist\nresources to forge an empiricism sufficiently rich and sophisticated\nto overcome critiques of earlier feminist empiricism offered, for\nexample, by\u00a0Harding\u00a0as well as to avoid feminist objections\nto individualism (whether to Jaggar\u2019s \u201cabstract\nindividualism\u201d or the other forms discussed above). Nelson\nmaintains that Quine\u2014while remaining an empiricist\u2014had\nalready undermined or abandoned many of the postpositivist\ncharacteristics to which Jaggar and Harding object. Thus empiricism,\ntempered by Nelson\u2019s focus on communities as knowers, can\nadequately take into account the social identities of knowers and the\ncomplex dependencies of individuals on epistemological\ncommunities.\n\nHelen Longino\u2019s approach in Science as Social Knowledge\n(1990) is to argue that among the many ways in which science is social\nis that epistemological norms apply to practices of\ncommunities, not just to individuals. In The Fate of\nKnowledge (2002), she further develops her contextual empiricist\nargument along lines that break down the dichotomy between the\nrational and the social (and many other dichotomies along the way).\nAlthough her argument has a wide scope, we are now concerned only with\nthe ways in which her view breaks the connection between individualism\nand empiricism. Longino distinguishes between individualism as a\nphilosophical position (that, among other things, tends to consider\nknowers interchangeable) and whether individuals, in fact, have\nknowledge (2002: 14\u201348). She does not deny that epistemic norms\napply to the practices of individuals or that Einstein had an\n\u201cextraordinary intellect, but what made [Einstein\u2019s] brilliant\nideas knowledge were the processes of critical reception\u201d (2002:\n122). Knowledge requires social interaction, not a dichotomy\nbetween the rational and the social; it also integrates\nvalues\u2014some of them social\u2014at both the constitutive and\ncontextual levels.\n\nThe responses of Longino, Nelson, Antony, and Duran to feminist\ncritiques of earlier stages of analytic philosophy all illustrate\nvariations on theme (1): they agree with certain facets of the\nfeminist critique, but draw on resources within particular strands of\nanalytic philosophy (in their cases naturalized\nepistemology/philosophy of science) as well as other feminist\nresources to produce epistemologies that overcome the objections to\nanalytic epistemology. Their strategies vary: Longino and Nelson\nde-emphasize the individual in favor of communities; Antony and Duran\nkeep the focus on individuals, but make them more concrete; in\naddition, Antony tries to resolve the paradox of bias.\n\nLet us turn much more briefly to strategies\n (2)\n and\n (3).\n The claim in (2) is that there were errors of interpretation in the\nfeminist analyses of analytic philosophy and its antecedents that\nweaken the feminist critiques. In (3) it is that critics have gone too\nfar in undermining fields of philosophy such as metaphysics or central\nnotions such as rationality that we need to retain. Examples of both\napproaches (sometimes even in one paper) can be found in Louise Antony\nand Charlotte Witt\u2019s A Mind of One\u2019s Own, a\ncollection of papers that focused on reason and objectivity in both\nthe history of Western philosophy and various fields of contemporary\nphilosophy (1993 [2002]). Those who propound claim (2) include\nMargaret Atherton and Louise Antony. Atherton (1993 [2002]) criticizes\nboth Genevieve Lloyd (1984) and Susan Bordo (1987) for their\ninterpretations of Descartes. Although Atherton\u2019s piece is\npurely historical, it is relevant to our discussion because feminists\nof all persuasions who debate the merit of analytic philosophy\nacknowledge historical analyses, especially Lloyd\u2019s extensive\nwork on \u201cthe man of reason\u201d. Louise Antony argues that\nJaggar (1983) and Jane Flax (1987) mischaracterize the rationalist or\nempiricist traditions, and so miss the extent to which analytic\nphilosophers have already rejected aspects of them. This leads\nfeminists to misidentify analytic epistemology with empiricism and\noverlook more rationalistic possibilities (Antony 1993 [2002]).\n\nFinally,\n strategy (3).\n When analytic feminists defend a field or a concept from critiques of\nother feminists who have \u201cgone too far\u201d, they might be\nfending off poststructuralist critics who do not want to do\ntraditional metaphysics at all or they might be arguing about which\naspects of the field are male-biased (for example, foundationalist\nstyles of metaphysics or the tendency to see selected categories as\nnatural). Both Charlotte Witt and Sally Haslanger argue that there is\nno specifically feminist reason for rejecting metaphysics in general.\nWitt considers the particular case of \u201cwhat it is to be\nhuman\u201d. She argues that feminists, in fact, need assumptions and\ntheories about what it is to be human even in order to criticize\ntraditional metaphysical theories (1993 [2002]). Haslanger discusses a\nrange of issues concerning social construction, realism, and natural\nand social kinds. In the course of her discussion of feminists such as\nCatharine MacKinnon and Judith Butler, Haslanger makes many\ndistinctions among kinds and functions of social constructions, sorts\nout ways in which metaphysics and politics are related, and, in\ngeneral, provides an example of feminist metaphysical debate that\ndistinguishes male-biased facets of metaphysics from facets useful for\nfeminists (1995b, 1996, 2000, 2012). One way of characterizing this\napproach is that it goes for the \u201ckernels of truth\u201d within\nlarger, more problematic (or at least more polemical) discussions, and\nthereby performs a service for readers who might be sympathetic with\nsome aspects of the views of MacKinnon or Butler, but who are not\nwilling to accept the body of work that encompasses them.\n\nA more controversial analytic feminist response that fits into\n (3)\n is Martha Nussbaum\u2019s defense of concepts and standards of\nobjectivity and reason. She argues forcefully that it is in\nfeminists\u2019 interests, both theoretically and practically, to\nretain fairly traditional ideals of objectivity and rationality while\nacknowledging their abusive use. This position, in itself, would not\nhave generated great controversy, even if not universally accepted.\nHowever, because Nussbaum sees certain critics of the male-biased\naspects of objectivity and reason as part of a \u201cfeminist assault\non reason\u201d (1994: 59), her essay and her interpretation of other\nfeminists\u2019 views generated wide and heated discussion among\nfeminist philosophers at the\n time.[12]\n\nAs we close the discussion of analytic feminists\u2019 responses to\ncritiques of analytic philosophy, it is important to restate the\nobvious: not every analytic feminist would agree with the responses\narticulated in the few examples chosen here. Indeed, in spite of the\ndesire that analytic feminist philosophy be sufficiently normative,\nthere is disagreement over issues such as the attitude to take toward\nconcepts that have typically embodied that normativity. Consider\ntraditional ideals of objectivity: views range from the claim that\nalthough the ideals of rationality and objectivity are \u201cboth\nunattainable and undesirable\u201d, we nevertheless ought to embrace\nthem as \u201cregulative norms\u201d or \u201cheuristics\u201d\n(Antony 1995: 87) to a number of different understandings of\nobjectivity that would make them not so subject to distortion or\nmisuse (for example, E. Lloyd 1995a, 1995b; Haslanger 1993 [2002];\nScheman 2001a; Heldke 2001; Janack 2002).\n\nFinally, we need to remember that what feminists expect of a\nphilosophical method\u2014their own preferred method(s) or\nothers\u2014will influence their critique of it. It is important to\nbe realistic in considering what any particular method might offer a\nfeminist. For example, an analytic method is likely to provide a\nfeminist with much more assistance in clarifying concepts, making\ndistinctions, and evaluating arguments than with creating her\n\u201cvision\u201d or defining the goals of her work (see Garry\n1995).\n7. Analytic Feminism: Limitations and Challenges\n\nAlthough traditional analytic philosophy seemed to many to be the\nleast hospitable philosophical method for feminism, analytic\nfeminists\u2019 work over the decades has greatly increased the\nmethod\u2019s hospitality and showed its promise. Let\u2019s now\nconsider some limitations and challenges that remain for analytic\nfeminism.\n\nThe strengths and limitations of various kinds of feminist\nphilosophies can grow from the same sources\u2014if feminists are\nclose to a mainstream tradition, they are subject to at least some of\nits limitations although they stand a better chance of influencing it\nand \u201cbuilding bridges\u201d than do those who critique the\ntradition more deeply. Audre Lorde, addressing the racism and\nheterosexism of a feminist conference in 1979, pointed to one risk\nquite powerfully by saying, \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never\ndismantle the master\u2019s house\u201d (Lorde 1984: 112). Although\nover the decades Lorde\u2019s claim sent chills down the spines of\nfeminists across the disciplines, the very existence of feminist\nphilosophy requires that neither the \u201ctools\u201d of the\nphilosophical trade nor the house(s) are the sole property of the\n\u201cmaster\u201d. Feminist philosophers, analytic or not, build on\nthe work not only of other feminists and other scholars doing engaged\nwork, but also of some traditional philosophers\nsometimes. Because of the desire to utilize as well as modify\ntraditional philosophy, feminists must always be alert for deeper\nlevels of male or other kinds of bias that may become apparent in\ntheir work\u2014possible unwanted baggage of traditional analytic\nphilosophy.\n\nSome potentially relevant \u201cbaggage\u201d for analytic feminists\ninclude the deeper limitations of their concepts and methods and the\nlevel of abstraction at which they tend to work. For example, when any\nof these contribute to an inability to notice and center diverse\nexperiences, analytic feminists do not attend to a full range of\ncomplex human lives that they hope to encompass; the impact and\nmeaning of race/ethnicity, social class, religion, nationality, queer\nand trans lives, lives of people with disabilities, and others will be\nlost. Examples of such limitations as well as others are below.\n\nKristie Dotson, while praising Fricker\u2019s (2007) strong\ncontribution to understanding epistemic injustice, argues that\nFricker\u2019s lack of an \u201copen conceptual structure\u201d\nabout what constitutes epistemic injustice leads her work to\nperpetuate epistemic injustice. This has happened, Dotson argues,\nbecause Fricker contrasts epistemic injustice with epistemic bad luck\n(Dotson 2012: 25). Dotson explores epistemic oppression in more\nexpansive ways that speak more directly to the different levels of\nsystemic oppression and that encompass various important forms of\nepistemic exclusion and violence, including, for example, silencing\nand smothering (2011, 2012, 2014).\nNaomi Scheman and Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff point out ways in\nwhich analytic feminists may not fully appreciate all the political,\nmetaphysical and epistemological baggage that has already been packed\ninto their theories and concepts. Scheman thinks that Nussbaum stops\nlistening too soon to attacks on rationality and fails to appreciate\nthat openness to reasonable argument (advocated by Nussbaum) implies\nthat we recognize when our own conception of reasonableness is being\nquestioned (Scheman 2001b). Alcoff, maintaining that we need\nsome concept of reason, makes a similar argument against\nNussbaum and points out the dogmatic character of claiming that some\nparticular concept of reason is the concept that\ncannot be given up (Alcoff 1995).\n\n\nA closely related objection is that it is not always easy or even\npossible to detach one\u2019s method from one\u2019s politics.\nBecause some analytic feminist work is liberal, for example, Nussbaum\n(2000a), Cudd (2006), and Bhandary (2020), other analytic feminists\ntake pains to separate their method from their politics. Antony argues\nthat her own socialist politics are compatible with an analytic method\n(2003). Although one can appreciate Antony\u2019s point, if an\nanalytic feminist is articulating a socialist feminism,\nrather than favoring some kind of socialism or other, then the facets\nof her position derived ultimately from Marx, from Quine, and from\nfeminism need to be hammered out carefully in order to settle down\ntogether well.\n\nOthers raise more general questions about the relation between\nphilosophical method and feminist and anti-racist politics. For\nexample, Alice Crary, taking on the general relation between\nphilosophical method and feminist politics, finds that Fricker\u2019s\nneutral philosophical methods and concepts of reason (2007) are not\nsufficiently radical to support feminist politics (2018). Tina\nFernandes Botts (2018) and Jana Cattien (2019) both criticize analytic\nfeminists\u2019 highly abstract level of analyzing race and gender as\nwell as their use of similar models for both. Instead, specific lived\nexperiences of marginalized people need to figure more centrally in\nour thinking (Botts 2018). Cattien argues that what is at stake\npolitically is obscured by analytic feminist metaphysicians (including\ntheir normative assumptions) and that they need \u201cto be able to\ntake themselves as objects of a politically charged critique\u201d\n(2019: 733). For example, she finds Haslanger\u2019s (2012) analysis\nthat places all races on one conceptual plane can\u2019t do justice\nto \u201cwhite complicities in perpetuating racist power\nrelations\u201d (2019: 720). \n\n\nClusters of separate objections focus around subjectivity and\nstandpoints. Traditional analytic philosophy has been rightly\ncriticized for its inability to handle subjectivity. In thinking about\nwhether this criticism applies to analytic feminists as well,\nlet\u2019s consider it in the context of knowledge. Elizabeth\nAnderson calls the position that knowledge is \u201csituated\u201d\nthe fundamental point of feminist epistemology (see\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science).\n Can \u201csituated\u201d knowledge as developed by analytic\nfeminists capture both the individual subjectivity of human beings and\nthe ways in which material conditions and complex social institutions\nstructure the standpoints of women and others in marginalized groups?\nThere are obviously two separate questions here\u2014asked together\nbecause they focus on whether analytic feminism has the resources to\ncapture what is very important to other feminist methodological\ntraditions: standpoint theory, psychoanalysis, and\npoststructuralism.\n\nConsider Longino as an example: she is dealing with situated knowledge\nin the context of the sciences. Her contextual empiricism and her more\nrecent argument to dissolve completely the rational/social dichotomy\nand the dichotomies that underlie it allow her to delve into the right\nareas. Of course, science is not all of life or knowledge, so her\nargument would need to be extended into areas of everyday life that\nCode, among others, has discussed. Whatever the limitations of\ncontextual empiricism, it is better at analyzing the structural and\nmaterial features that construct subjectivity than it is at\nilluminating individual subjectivity. It is in the latter area that\npoststructuralist and psychoanalytic approaches flourish (see, for\nexample, Butler 1990; Butler & Salih 2003; Irigaray\n1991;\u00a0Whitford 1991; Kristeva & Oliver 2002). Their focus on\nthe opaque, fragmented, or unfinished character of human subjectivity\nmay be a bit untidy for many analytic feminists. But given the\nimportance of this topic for feminist philosophy, there is a need for\nfruitful dialogue about it. \n\n\nFeminist standpoint theory, drawing originally from Marxist theory,\nraised a cluster of questions for analytic feminists: whether they can\nexplain the political/material construction of standpoints in the\nproduction of knowledge, how they treat community-wide biases and\nassumptions, what criteria they use to distinguish \u201cgood\u201d\nand \u201cbad\u201d biases, and so on. Harding advocates a\npluralistic form of standpoint theory that focuses on the importance\nof starting research from the lives of marginalized people (1991).\nDoing so has many advantages, including an increased likelihood that\nwe will be able to uncover community-wide biases and assumptions of\nthe privileged as we produce knowledge in a number of fields. Although\ninitially analytic feminist empiricists and standpoint theorists saw\neach other as embodying rival traditions and were often critical of\neach other, analytic feminist empiricists then developed significant\ninterest in looking at the resources offered by standpoint theory as\nwell as pursuing common themes or consensus in the two kinds of\napproaches (see, for example, Wylie 2004; Potter 2006; Crasnow 2008;\nIntemann 2010, 2016; Anderson 2020; and a 2009 Hypatia\nsymposium that includes Crasnow, Harding, Rouse, Kourany, Rolin, and\nSolomon, all 2009). A range of possibilities include\n\nincorporating the insights of standpoint theory into empirical\n(and empiricist) work (Wylie 2004),\nmaintaining that in a number of their forms they are compatible\n(Anderson 2020), or\narguing that feminist empiricism and standpoint theory have\nsignificant overlaps but that their remaining differences show that\nthey need each other (Intemann 2010).\n\n\nFuller discussion of these issues can be found in Intemann (2010,\n2016), Anderson (2020), and entries on\n feminist social epistemology\u00a0and\n feminist perspectives on science. \n\n\nRelated objections arise concerning naturalized epistemology. As\nmentioned above, feminist social epistemology is the most typical form\nof naturalized feminist epistemology today. Social epistemologists\nhave deep critiques of individually oriented and\n\u201cscientistic\u201d analytic naturalized epistemology. In\naddition to feminists already discussed above, Code and Phyllis Rooney\nhave both argued that there is tension between typical naturalized\nepistemology and feminist epistemology; Rooney calls it an\n\u201cuneasy alliance\u201d (Rooney 2003). Code offers an ecological\nmodel that she maintains is preferable to analytically and\nindividualistically oriented naturalism (1996, 2006). Rooney appeals\nto psychological studies of gender and cognition to provide evidence\nfor her critique of assumptions of empirical studies (and of the\nepistemology that structures and then uses the empirical results). For\nexample, Rooney wants to critique the assumption of the stability of\nthe individual/social distinction, the stability of gender\u2014or\neven that gender is either stable or situational, for there might be\nmore choices (Rooney 2003). Although analytic feminist naturalized\nepistemologists might well agree with much of Rooney\u2019s critique,\nCode\u2019s 2006 ecological model would be a nearly impossible\nstretch. In any case, analytic feminists must be very careful as they\nchoose their own models to reflect upon the kinds of assumptions to\nwhich they acquiesce, whether those just mentioned or others that\nmight go under the label \u201cscientism\u201d. \n\n\nThe final cluster of challenges concerns language, images, and\n\u201crhetorical space\u201d. These challenges are meant to call\nattention to other kinds of \u201cbaggage\u201d of which analytic\nfeminists need to be aware. Although both feminist and nonfeminist\nanalytic philosophers are thought to favor literal uses of language,\nthey also rely on metaphors, analogies, images and the like in the\ncourse of making their philosophical cases (think of the frequency of\nNeurath\u2019s ship via Quine). Analytic feminists need to give\nattention to the assumptions and implications of their literal uses of\nlanguage, their images and how they relate to what Lorraine Code calls\nthe \u201crhetorical spaces\u201d in which they function (or, in\nother cases, fail to function). In using \u201crhetorical\nspaces\u201d Code is thinking of the ways in which our discourses are\nstructured to limit what can count as meaningful, be taken seriously,\nyield insight, expect uptake, and so on (1995: ix\u2013x; with\ncontinued discussion in Code 2006).\n\nMarguerite La Caze, using methodology developed by Mich\u00e8le Le\nD\u0153uff, argues that both feminist and nonfeminist analytic\nphilosophers use images that can unwittingly perpetuate images that\nexclude women\u2014think of mythical social contracts in political\nphilosophy and visual and spatial metaphors about knowledge (La Caze\n2002, Le D\u0153uff 1980 [1989]; see also Gatens 1991). Analytic\nfeminists are being called upon to widen the rhetorical spaces in\nanalytic philosophy as well as to recognize and scrutinize the images\nthat they, in fact, use in the course of their allegedly literal\nspeech. \n\n\nMost analytic feminists welcome challenges to their positions from\nother feminists of any background. For, after all, there is no easier\nway to be kept honest and to recognize one\u2019s own collusion with\nmale or other biases in philosophy than to have feminist colleagues\npoint it out. It is part of any reasonable feminism to want to remain\nopen to the ongoing possibility of collusion and self-deception.\nCandid, fair-minded conversation benefits all forms of feminism.\n8. Is it Important to Identify Feminists by Their Philosophical Methods?\n\nAlthough methodology is the focus in this entry, it is nevertheless\nimportant to ask to what extent there is value in identifying feminist\nphilosophy by method (see Garry 2018). The field of academic feminist\nphilosophy has developed, even flourished, across most all\nphilosophical fields and topics since the 1970s\u2014in spite of\nbacklash and lingering resistance harbored in some quarters. Feminist\nphilosophers have taught and mentored multiple generations of students\nwho themselves generate new directions in feminist philosophy;\nfeminist dissertations, publications, and organizations have\nincreased; feminists drawing on many different philosophical methods\nlearn from and cite each other; practitioners of fields such as\nfeminism, critical race theory, trans and queer theory, critical\ndisability theory, decolonial theory, and others, understand the\nimportance of engaging across and integrating work in these fields.\nMany feminist philosophers, especially from more recent generations,\nsimply go about their work without concerning themselves with labels\nof philosophical method. In this context there are reasons to downplay\ndifferences in method. In addition, it makes sense not to emphasize\nphilosophical method if it unnecessarily limits the appeal of\nsomeone\u2019s work, especially in interdisciplinary or transnational\nfeminist contexts. Nor would one want a focus on method to be\naccompanied by a lack of open-mindedness or a sense of\n\u201csuperiority\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, methodological labels can be useful. They can help\nus understand feminists\u2019 framing of issues, terminology,\nprobable toolboxes, and the feminist and traditional philosophers most\nlikely to have influenced their work. After all, feminist philosophers\noften carry the methodological influence of their graduate philosophy\ndepartments for many decades thereafter, albeit with varying strengths\nof attachment. In addition, some feminists want to acknowledge\nexplicitly their connection to analytic philosophy; for example, Cudd\nin Analyzing Oppression, makes a point to situate her work in\nand defend both the analytic and liberal traditions (2006: ix).\n\nIn fact, some discussions are best understood in an analytic context\nand are engaged in primarily by analytic feminists, for example,\ntwenty-first century debates in philosophy of language and metaphysics\nconcerning the categories of woman/man, sex, and gender. They have\nencompassed disagreements over the nature of social categories and\nsocial construction, the degree to which social categories have\ngrounding in the material world or should be analyzed as dispositions\nto behave, the moral and political values assumed in metaphysical\ndiscussions, the meaning of the categories for trans, queer, and\nnonbinary people (including their legal implications), and so on (for\nexample, see Witt 2011a; Haslanger 2012; Saul 2012; Bettcher 2013,\n2017; Diaz-Leon 2016; Jenkins 2016, 2018; Mikkola 2016; \u00c1sta\n2018; Dembroff 2018, 2020; Barnes 2020; Antony 2020\u2014among many\nothers. More detailed discussion can also be found in the entries on\n feminist philosophy of language,\n feminist metaphysics, and\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender.)\n\nAnother reason to wonder about the importance of methodological labels\nis that methods can work in varied ways across philosophical\nsubfields. Consider whether fields such as moral, social, and\npolitical philosophy frequently have separate analytic discussions or\nmethodological identifications. Although feminist philosophers in\nthese fields might prefer a particular writing or argumentative style\nor prefer to engage with Rawls rather than Levinas or Habermas, the\nfault lines or \u201csides\u201d in major feminist controversies\nrarely fall neatly into divisions among analytic and non-analytic\nfeminists. Instead, early typical feminist controversies in moral\nphilosophy, for example, concerned whether one should favor an ethics\nof justice over an ethics of care or a virtue ethics, or whether one\nshould prefer Kant over Hume or Aristotle as a starting point for\nmoral thinking (see, for example, Held 1993, Herman 1993, Homiak 1993,\nLarrabee 1993, Baier 1994). Interestingly, the degree to which\nfeminist moral philosophers\u2014analytic or not\u2014rely upon and\nintegrate historical figures into their work seems to be greater than\namong analytic feminists doing epistemology and metaphysics.\n\nAnother persistently debated topic that does not divide neatly by\nmethodological orientation is the extent to which liberalism is\nsatisfactory for feminist politics and ethics. For example, Nussbaum\ndefends her well known liberal \u201ccapabilities\u201d approach as\napplicable across cultures against anti-liberal opponents (2000a,\n2000b, entry on\n the capability approach).\n Asha Bhandary also supports liberalism and maintains that it can\nadequately support dependency care provided that we make sure that\ncaregiving and caregivers do not remain invisible due to sexism and\nracism (2020). However, Serene Khader, argues that although feminism\nneeds \u201cuniversalist\u201d opposition to sexism, it does not\nrequire Western liberalism, which itself can even perpetuate sexist\noppression in some cultures (2019). Debates over liberalism are not\nlikely to end soon, especially given the number of philosophers\nwriting from decolonial perspectives.\n\nAs feminists explore a wide range of topics in moral, social, and\npolitical philosophy the salience of their methodological background\noften recedes, especially when their work draws on resources both\noutside and inside philosophy\u2014sometimes including the\nauthors\u2019 own social locations and experiences. Their work also\nbears on urgent public issues. Let\u2019s note briefly a few\ndifferent kinds of examples. Serena Parekh combines multiple\nphilosophical and empirical methods in writing on refugees and the\nethics of forced displacement (2017). For many decades Anita Allen has\ncombined law and philosophy in her work on privacy (1988, 2019).\nMyisha Cherry writes about rage and other emotions and attitudes in\npublic life (2019, forthcoming). Ayanna De\u2019Vante Spencer is\namong those writing about the missing narratives of Black women and\ngirls who have been victims of police brutality (2018). Eva Feder\nKittay has written for many years on the ethics of dependency and\ncare, cognitive disabilities, and their impact on moral philosophy\n(for example, 1999, 2019). And, of course, there are entire fields of\nfeminist ethics that cross many kinds of methodological lines, for\nexample,\n feminist bioethics\n and\n feminist philosophy of disability,\n and the wider field of\n critical disability theory.\n\nWhen philosophers\u2019 own intersectional identities are reflected\nin their writing, their identities usually have more prominence than\ntheir choice of philosophical toolbox or a preference for an\n\u201canalytic writing style\u201d. For example, Alcoff and Naomi\nZack have both written on race and mixed race for decades (Zack 1993,\nAlcoff 2006); some of their more recent work on mixed race has been\ncollected along with other feminists and philosophers of race in Botts\n(2016). For other philosophers, writing as lesbian feminists and more\nrecently as trans feminists is salient. For example, since the\nbeginning of academic feminist philosophy Marilyn Frye, Claudia Card,\nand Sarah Hoagland have provided decades of lesbian feminist\nphilosophy (see, for example, Frye 1983, 1992, 2001; Card 1995, 1996,\n2002; Hoagland, 1988). Cheshire Calhoun\u2019s Feminism, The\nFamily, and the Politics of the Closet explores the structure of\ngay and lesbian subordination and its relation to feminism (2000).\nTrans feminist philosophers work on topics in moral and political\nphilosophy as well as metaphysics and epistemology; they aim to make\ntrans lives visible, livable, valued, and understood (See, for\nexample, Bettcher 2019, forthcoming; Kapusta 2016; McKinnon 2014; Zurn\n2019).\n\nAs we draw this section to a close, it is important not to overstate\nthe way differences in philosophical methods play out in generations\nof feminists or in subfields of feminist philosophy: the differences\nare matters of degree. It is even more important to remind ourselves\nthat feminist philosophy, whatever its method, retains both feminist\nand philosophical roots. It is not to be subsumed solely under a\npatrilineal philosophical identity. In the context of discussing the\nimportance of constructing a feminist genealogy of feminist thought by\nclaiming and engaging with other feminist thinkers, Frye notes\nironically how much \u201cbetter placed in history\u201d it seems to\nbe when one is seen\n\n\nin that august Oxbridge lineage [of Austin and Wittgenstein, rather]\nthan in a lineage featuring dozens of mimeographed feminist pamphlets\nauthored by collectives, \u2026 Kate Millett, Mary Daly, Andrea\nDworkin, \u2026 [feminist philosophers such as] Claudia Card, Naomi\nScheman, Maria Lugones, Sarah Hoagland, and troubadours like Alix\nDobkin and Willie Tyson. (Frye 2001: 86\u201387)\n\n\nIn order to resist the comfort/erasure of the patrilineal heritage,\nanalytic feminists, echoing Frye, can claim and engage other feminist\nthinkers, critical race theorists, trans and queer theorists, and\nmore. Many already do so. This will not only help to sustain a\nfeminist tradition, it will also increase the richness of feminist\nwork and decrease the odds of feminists being held captive by\nmale-biased philosophical methods, theories, concepts and images.\n\nAnalytic feminists have left barely any philosophical topic untouched.\nReaders who want to review the most recent work by analytic feminists\nin specific areas of philosophy should consult the entries listed\nhere.
