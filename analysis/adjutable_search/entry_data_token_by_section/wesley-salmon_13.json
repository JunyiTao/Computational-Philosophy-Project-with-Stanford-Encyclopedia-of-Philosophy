    "main_text": "Explanation and Causality || Two Levels of Explanation\n5.6 Two Levels of Explanation\n\nUnlike conjunctive forks, causal processes and interactions cannot be\ndefined in purely statistical terms. To stress this crucial\ndifference, Salmon referred to statistical causality in terms\nof screening off and conjunctive forks, and aleatory\ncausality in terms of processes and interactive forks. Aleatory\ncausality \u201cplaces primary emphasis on the mechanisms of\ncausality\u201d (Salmon 1990c [1998: 207]) and informs us about how\nphenomena fit within the mechanisms responsible for their occurrence.\nStatistical regularities are all that is needed by statistical\ncausality, whereas aleatory causality requires more, namely the\npossibility to speak of tendencies that are both causal and\nprobabilistic. Salmon thought that propensities, taken as causal\nprobabilistic tendencies\n (\u00a7 2.3),\n prove fruitful in that connection, and held that:\n\n\nif we think of propensities as probabilistic causes, we can use the\nconcepts of causal processes and causal mechanisms in order to explain\nthe mechanisms of probabilistic causality. (Salmon 1990c [1998:\n205])\n\n\nTo the two kinds of causality described by Salmon there correspond two\ndifferent levels of explanation: (1) the S-R model, which concerns\nconnections between kinds of events, and (2) causal mechanical\nexplanation, which bears upon single events. It should not pass\nunnoticed that while explanation of the first level, based on\nstatistical correlations, provides a good basis for prediction,\nexplanation in terms of aleatory causality traces back the history of\nevents after their occurrence. In the Eighties, Salmon thought that\nonly aleatory causality could offer an adequate understanding of\ncausality and regarded the causal mechanical level as genuine\nexplanation, assigning an ancillary role to the S-R level.\n\nIn a penetrating discussion Christopher Hitchcock observed that\nSalmon\u2019s causal mechanical explanation was too weak, because it\nenvisaged a geometrical network of processes and interactions but did\nnot convey any hint as to what properties should be taken as\nexplanatory. In agreement with Woodward (1984), Hitchcock held that\nexplanation should answer\n\u201cwhat-if-things-had-been-different\u201d questions, and claimed\nthat\n\n\na successful account of explanation had better make the relation of\nexplanatory relevance look roughly like that of counterfactual\ndependence. (Hitchcock 1995: 311)\n\n\nAccording to Hitchcock\n\n\nour demand that explanations provide relevant information\nrequires something stronger\u2014that we be told which\nearlier properties the properties specified in the explanandum depend\nupon. (Hitchcock 1995: 311)\n\n\na requisite Salmon\u2019s definition of processes and causal\ntransmission does not meet. By way of a counterexample, Hitchcock\nobserved that based on Salmon\u2019s theory a blue spot impressed on\na billiard ball by a stick on which a player had put blue chalk would\ncount as a mark transmitted by a causal process, and furthermore one\nwould be unable to tell why the linear momentum of the\nbilliard ball should be included in the explanation of its movement,\nwhereas the blue mark should not.\n\nIn reply to Hitchcock, Salmon revised his position by ascribing equal\nsignificance to the two levels of explanation. In \u201cA Reply to\nTwo Critiques\u201d he wrote:\n\n\nI would now say (1) that statistical relevance relations, in the\nabsence of connecting causal processes, lack explanatory import and\n(2) that connecting causal processes, in the absence of statistical\nrelevance relations, also lack explanatory import. [\u2026] Both are\nindispensable. (Salmon 1997: 476)\n\n\nThe causal model in terms of processes was compared to a telephone\nnetwork which exhibits the lines of communications and the\nconnections, but does not convey any information about the messages\nthat are sent. In order to identify the properties pertinent to given\noutcomes one needs information on statistical relevance relations; the\nprocedure of singling out such properties results from an interplay\nbetween causal and statistical relevance information. On the one hand,\na network of causal processes and interactions serves to exclude\nirrelevant factors which are not there at the considered place and\ntime; on the other, the network has to be filled with statistical\nrelevance relations linking the properties present.\n\nContextually, Salmon admitted that counterfactual considerations play\na role within explanation, and reaffirmed a close connection between\nstatistical relevance relations and counterfactuals. To take\nSalmon\u2019s example,\n\n\nwhen asserting that a window was shattered because it was struck by a\nbaseball traveling at a considerable velocity, we presumably have in\nmind that the window would not have broken if the intersection with\nthe baseball had not occurred. (Salmon 1997: 475)\n\n\nSuch a counterfactual is deemed unproblematic because it is supported\nby well-established assertions of statistical relevance, which are\nnothing other than reports of observed relative frequencies.\n",
