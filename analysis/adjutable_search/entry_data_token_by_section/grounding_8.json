    "main_text": "The Nature of Grounding || Hyperintensionality and non-monotonicity\n2.2 Hyperintensionality and non-monotonicity\n\nGrounding theorists also routinely claim that grounding is\nhyperintensional (Bader 2013; Leuenberger 2014; Schaffer 2009). This\nissue concerns what linguistic distinctions grounding is sensitive to.\nIt will be helpful to begin by considering the hyperintensionality of\nbelief. Consider the following belief attribution:\n\nAmy believes that Mark Twain was a humorist.\n\n\nNote that, were we to replace\n\nMark Twain was a humorist\n\n\nas it appears in this belief attribution with a necessarily\nco-extensional expression such as\n\nSamuel Clemens was a humorist\n\n\nthe resulting belief attribution may have a different truth-value than\nthe original one. This is the sense in which belief is thought to be\nhyperintensional.\n\nWe can understand the claim that grounding is hyperintensional in a\nsimilar way. Consider again the following grounding claim:\n\n[Beijing exists] grounds [{Beijing} exists].\n\n\nWere we to replace\n\n[Beijing exists]\n\n\nas it appears in this grounding claim with a necessarily\nco-extensional expression such as\n\n[{Beijing} exists]\n\n\nthe resulting grounding claim may have a different truth-value than\nthe original one. In this case, it seems that the two grounding claims\ndo in fact differ in truth-value\u2014while the original grounding\nclaim is true, the resulting one is presumably false. (See Duncan,\nMiller, & Norton 2017 for discussion of the relationship between\ngrounding and various senses of hyperintensionality.)\n\nGrounding theorists also normally claim that grounding is\nnon-monotonic (Audi 2012a; Guigon 2018; Rosen 2010). Logical\nentailment is monotonic in the following sense: if one sentence\nlogically entails another, then the first sentence together with any\nother sentence logically entails the second. Returning to grounding,\nsuppose that \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 grounds \\([Q]\\). And suppose\nthat \\([R],\\) \\([R'],\\) \u2026 obtain. Grounding is non-monotonic\njust in case these suppositions are compatible with it not being the\ncase that \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 together with \\([R],\\) \\([R'],\\)\n\u2026 grounds \\([Q]\\). To take an example, consider again\n[Beijing exists] grounds [{Beijing}\nexists]. Rather than replacing [Beijing exists] in\nthis sentence with something else as we did above, let\u2019s add\nsome other nominalized true sentence to it such as [Gomer is a\ngood dog]. The resulting sentence (i.e., [Beijing\nexists], [Gomer is a good dog] grounds\n[{Beijing} exists]) is clearly false, while our\noriginal grounding claim (we\u2019re supposing, anyway) is true.\n",
