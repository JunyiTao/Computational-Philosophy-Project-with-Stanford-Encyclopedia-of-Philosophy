Augustine\u2019s thought was shaped in part by\nPlotinus and Porphyry, some of whose texts he read in Latin\ntranslation; in part by his personal experience of the competing\nfaiths of his time\u2014Christianity, Manichaeism, Graeco-Roman\npaganism; in part by a Latin philosophical and literary tradition; and\nin the greatest part by his own, relentless self-critical genius as a\nthinker. Latin philosophers also had direct access to eras of ancient\nphilosophy earlier than the Platonism of Plotinus through Latin\nauthors, such as Cicero (scepticism, stoicism), Seneca\n(stoicism).\nIn Arabic, there was the tradition of kal\u0101m theology\n (\u00a72.4).\n Philosophical thought about language was sometimes linked to Arabic\ngrammatical thought and both it and ethics to adab, the\ntradition of literary and historical studies needed to make a person\ncultivated. Sufism\u2014an Islamic mystical tradition\u2014also\ndeeply influenced some philosophers\n (\u00a72.4,\n \u00a72.6,\n \u00a72.10).\nJewish thinkers inherited, not just the written Law of the Torah,\nbut oral law, recorded in the Mishna and the tradition of Talmudic\ncommentary on it. The central Jewish philosopher, Maimonides\n (\u00a72.6)\n is also the greatest of the Talmudic scholars.\n\n",
