The first kind is\nacquaintance knowledge: we know our mothers, our friends, our\npets, etc., by being acquainted with them. The second kind is\nknowledge of facts, propositional knowledge, or\nknowledge-that: this is the sort of knowledge we acquire when\nwe learn that, say, Ithaca is in New York State or that Turin is\nlocated in Italy. It is customary to add to the list a third\nkind of knowledge that is supposed to be distinct both from\nacquaintance knowledge and from propositional knowledge. One possesses\nthis knowledge when one can be truly described as knowing how\nto do something: play the piano, make a pie, walk, speak, create,\nbuild, and so on.\n\nThe distinction between knowledge-how and knowledge-that was brought\nto scrutiny in analytic philosophy by Ryle in his seminal The\nConcept of Mind (1949), where he raised some of the now classical\nobjections to the so-called \u201cintellectualist legend\u201d: the\nview that knowledge-how amounts to knowledge-that. Ryle instead\nadvocated an \u201canti-intellectualist\u201d view of knowledge-how\naccording to which knowledge-how and knowledge-that are distinct kinds\nof knowledge, and manifestations of knowledge-how are not necessarily\nmanifestations of knowledge-that. This anti-intellectualism has been\nthe received view among philosophers for a long time. Even\npsychologists and neuroscientists have explicitly appealed to\nRyle\u2019s classical distinction when discussing their empirical\nfindings (e.g., Cohen & Squire 1980; Anderson 1983). Nevertheless,\nin the last twenty years, a renewed interest by epistemologists in the\nnature of knowledge-how has brought new life to the debate, where new\nversions of intellectualism and anti-intellectualism have been\ndeveloped and argued for. The debate is partly epistemological: is\nknowledge-how an altogether distinct kind of knowledge, different from\nknowledge-that? But it is also about a psychological question: what\nkind of psychological state is knowledge-how? The goal of this entry\nis to overview the debate between intellectualists and\nanti-intellectualists, while highlighting the implications of this\ndebate for related questions concerning intelligence, cognition,\nlanguage, and skills. \n\nThis entry starts by looking at some classical arguments against\nintellectualism about knowledge-how: the regress argument (section 1),\nthe insufficiency argument (section 2), and the gradability argument\n(section 3). Then two motivating arguments for intellectualism are\nconsidered: the linguistic argument (section 4) and the action theory\nargument (section 5). Section 6 overviews the recent epistemological\ndebate on whether knowledge-how and propositional knowledge have the\nsame epistemic profile. Section 7 discusses the cognitive science\nargument against intellectualism. Section 8 surveys what forms\nanti-intellectualism about knowledge-how has taken in the recent\nliterature. Section 9 looks at the relation between knowledge-how and\nskills. Section 10 discusses knowledge-how and other related\ntopics.\n", "toc": [{"#RegrArgu": "1.

The Regress Argument\n\nRyle\u2019s most famous objection to intellectualist accounts of\nskills and knowledge-how is that they lead to a vicious regress: \n\n\nThe consideration of propositions is itself an operation the execution\nof which can be more or less intelligent, less or more stupid. But if,\nfor any operation to be intelligently executed, a prior theoretical\noperation had first to be performed and performed intelligently, it\nwould be a logical impossibility for anyone ever to break into the\ncircle. (1949: 19)\n\n\nRyle concludes: \n\n\n\u201cIntelligent\u201d cannot be defined in terms of\n\u201cintellectual\u201d or \u201cknowing how\u201d in terms of\n\u201cknowing that\u201d, (1949: 20) \n\n\non pain of a vicious regress (see also Ryle 1946: 22). Exactly how to\nreconstruct Ryle\u2019s argument is a matter of controversy (Stanley\n& Williamson 2001; Stanley 2011b; Bengson & Moffett 2011a;\nCath 2013; Fantl 2011; Kremer 2020). The next sections discuss\ndifferent possible ways of understanding the regress challenge and\npossible responses on behalf of intellectualism.\n1.1 The Contemplation Argument\n\nThe contemplation argument assumes for reductio that for any\naction to be intelligently executed, a prior theoretical operation of\n\u201ccontemplating\u201d has to be performed first : \n\n\nContemplation premise (CP): In order to employ\none\u2019s knowledge that p, one must contemplate the\nproposition p. \n\n\nAssume in addition the following definition of intellectualism:\n\n\nStrong intellectualism (SI): For an action \u03a6,\nknowing how to \u03a6 consists in knowing some proposition\np.\n\n\nAnd assume further that in performing an action \u03a6, one employs\none\u2019s knowledge-how to \u03a6:\n\n\nAction premise (AP): For an action \u03a6, if one\n\u03a6s, then one employs one\u2019s knowledge-how to \u03a6.\n\n\nWith these premises the regress goes as follows. Suppose that one\nperforms an action \u03a6:\n\nBy AP, one employs one\u2019s knowledge-how to \u03a6. \nBy SI, one employs the knowledge that p, for some p.\n\nSo, by CP, one contemplates p. \nBut contemplating p is an action.\nSo by AP, if one contemplates p, one employs one\u2019s\nknowledge-how to contemplate p. \nBy CP, one ought to contemplate another proposition q, for\nsome q. \n\n\nAnd so on. \n\nThe contemplation argument aims at showing the falsity of SI, by\nshowing that its truth, together with the truth of AP and CP, triggers\nan infinite regress. If SI were true, then performing any action would\nrequire contemplating an infinite number of propositions of\never-increasing complexity. On the assumption that this cannot be done\nin a finite amount of time, the argument goes, accepting SI would lead\nto the clearly absurd conclusion that no agent could ever perform an\naction within a finite time (see Fantl 2011: 122). \n\nThe question is whether AP and CP are plausible premises. Following\nGinet (1975), Stanley & Williamson (2001) argue that AP is\nplausible only if the relevant \u03a6 is an intentional\naction. To use one of Ryle\u2019s (1949: 33) own examples, if a\nclumsy person inadvertently tumbles, it does not follow that in doing\nso, they employ their knowledge-how to tumble. By contrast, the clown\nemploys their knowledge-how when they tumble on purpose. Nevertheless,\nif we restrict AP to intentional actions, then the regress can be\nstopped by observing that contemplating a proposition might happen\nnon-intentionally. For example, when I employ my knowledge that there\nis a red light ahead by applying the brakes, I need not intentionally\ncontemplate the proposition that there is a red light ahead.\nCorrespondingly, if contemplating a proposition can be done\nnon-intentionally, such contemplation is not the kind of action that\nrequires us to know how to perform it\u2014therefore, it does not\ntrigger the restricted AP and the regress is blocked altogether. Some\nobject that the contemplation in this example might be intentional but\nunconscious (as suggested by No\u00eb 2005: 282). But it is\nunclear what reasons there are for thinking that every time one\nemploys one\u2019s knowledge, one intentionally contemplates the\nrelevant proposition (Cath 2013: 365\u2013366). \n\nThe Contemplation Argument also assumes CP\u2014i.e., that in order\nto employ propositional knowledge when acting, one ought to\ncontemplate the relevant proposition. Against CP, Ginet (1975: 7)\nobserves that one might manifest one\u2019s knowledge that one can\nget the door open by turning the knob and pushing it (as well as my\nknowledge that there is a door there) by performing that operation\nquite automatically as one leaves the room; and one may do this\nwithout formulating (in one\u2019s mind or out loud) that proposition\nor any other relevant proposition. Ginet concludes that Ryle\u2019s\noriginal argument does not teach us that intellectualism about\nknowledge-how is false but only that knowledge can be acted upon and\nmanifested without requiring any contemplation on the part of the\nagent. Indeed, some scholars think that this last weaker claim was the\nonly goal of Ryle\u2019s original argument (Rosefeldt 2004; Sax\n2010).\n1.2 The Employment Regress\n\nHowever, CP is not needed in order to trigger a regress. Perhaps the\nargument can be salvaged by replacing contemplation with a weaker\nrelation. Consider replacing CP with EP:\n\n\nThe Employment Premise (EP): If one employs knowledge\nthat p, one employs knowledge-how to employ one\u2019s\nknowledge that p (and one\u2019s state of knowledge that\np is distinct from one\u2019s state of knowing how to employ\none\u2019s knowledge that p). (Cath 2013: 367\u20138)\n\n\nThe regress is triggered as before. Suppose one \u03a6s:\n\n By AP, one employs one\u2019s knowledge-how to \u03a6.\n By SI, that amounts to employing one\u2019s knowledge that\np, for some p. \nBy EP, one needs to employ one\u2019s knowledge-how to employ\none\u2019s knowledge that p.\n But employing one\u2019s knowledge-how is an action. \n By AP, one employs one\u2019s knowledge-how about employing our\nknowledge-how to employ one\u2019s knowledge that p.\n By SI, that amounts to employing one\u2019s knowledge of\nq, for some q. \n\n\nand so on. \n\nIntellectualists might object to EP in ways similar to how CP was\nresisted\u2014i.e., that not every action requires for its\nperformance the employment of one\u2019s knowledge-how: only\nintentional actions do, as the clown example suggests. According to\nthis line of reply, employing one\u2019s propositional knowledge\nmight be more like a reflex in response to stimuli, rather than an\naction. Further, this version of the regress challenge may be accused\nof assuming that knowledge-that is \u201cbehaviorally inert\u201d\nand needs to be intentionally selected or employed in order to be\nmanifested. Yet, intellectualists have independent reasons to resist\nthis picture (Stalnaker 2012). On the other hand, if Ryleans insist\nthat employments of knowledge-that are actions of sort, it seems there\nis no principled reason why employments of knowledge-how would not be\nsubject to the same requirement. Therefore, it looks like any regress\ngenerated for the intellectualist is generated for Ryle as well\n(Stanley 2011b: 14, 26; though see Fantl 2011 for a possible\ndifference between the regress generated for Ryle and the regress\ngenerated for intellectualism). \n1.3 A Revival of the Regress Argument\n\nA variety of actions\u2014say, remembering to check the car\u2019s\nblindspot when reversing\u2014can be intelligent even though they are\nnot intentional. Or one might manifest intelligence through\nprocesses\u2014e.g., by coming to understand a difficult\nproposition, without them even being actions. If one accepts that\nintelligent performances, whether intentional or not, are necessarily\nguided by knowledge-how, one might try to recast the regress argument\nby replacing AP with IPP (Weatherson 2017): \n\n\nIntelligent performance premise (IPP): For a\nperformance \u03a6, if one \u03a6s intelligently, one manifests\none\u2019s knowledge-how to \u03a6.\n\n\nNow it seems plausible that one\u2019s manifestation of propositional\nknowledge can be intelligent in some cases but not in others. For\nexample, one might manifest one\u2019s knowledge intelligently by\nbringing to bear one maxim that is appropriate instead of any other\nthat is not to the particular situation which the agent faces. By IPP,\nif one\u2019s manifestation of knowledge-that in a particular\nsituation is intelligent, it requires one\u2019s manifesting\none\u2019s knowledge-how. If intellectualism is true, that would in\nturn require manifesting one\u2019s knowledge-that. If this\nmanifesting of propositional knowledge is intelligent too, though\nunintentional, it requires knowledge-how. And so on. We get an\ninfinite regress if one accepts that manifesting propositional\nknowledge can be an intelligent performance, also when it is not an\nintentional action. (For similar lines of argument, see also Fridland\n2013, 2015; L\u00f6wenstein 2016: 276\u201380; Small 2017:\n62\u20133).\n\nIntellectualists might respond by distinguishing two senses\nin which a performance can be intelligent and two corresponding senses\nof manifestation, only one of which gives rise to the regress. First,\nan intelligent action might manifest one\u2019s knowledge-how in the\ncase that it is guided by this knowledge-how. On this\nreading, the regress is triggered. But there is also\nanother\u2014epistemic\u2014sense in which an intelligent action\nmanifests knowledge-how as long as it provides evidence for\nthat knowledge-how. For example, the rings on a tree provide evidence\nfor the tree\u2019s age (hence manifest its age in the epistemic\nsense) but the rings on a tree are not guided by its age. Crucially,\nthe regress does not arise on the epistemic sense of manifestation.\nChecking the blindspot might be intelligent in this epistemic sense of\nmanifesting \u2014providing evidence of\u2014knowledge-how. Yet,\nthis epistemic manifestation itself is not something that qualifies as\nintelligent or unintelligent.\n1.4 Lewis Carroll\u2019s Regress\n\nA less discussed regress that can be found in Ryle (1946: 6\u20137)\nis an adaptation of Lewis Carroll\u2019s (1895) regress. Suppose a\nstudent understands the premises of an argument and also its\nconclusion but fails to see that the conclusion follows. In order to\nhelp him, the teacher teaches him another proposition\nP\u2014i.e., if the premises are true, then the conclusion is\ntrue. The student understands this and yet fails to see how from the\npremises and the additional premise P the conclusion follows. A\nsecond hypothetical proposition is added to his store, the proposition\nthat if the premises is true, the conclusion is true too. The student\nstill fails to see. And so on. Ryle concludes: \n\n\nKnowing a rule of inference is not possessing a bit of extra\ninformation but being able to perform an intelligent operation.\nKnowing a rule is knowing how. It is realized in performances which\nconform to the rule, not in theoretical citations of it. (1946: 7)\n\n\n\nOne might respond (cf. Stanley 2011b) to this regress challenge that\nthe student does not really understand the premises of an argument by\nmodus ponens (p, if p then q), for that\ninvolves grasping the concept of a conditional, and on an\ninferentialist understanding (Boghossian 1996, 2003), that would\ndispose one to accept the conclusion of an inference by that rule.\nInferentialism about meaning is, however, a controversial doctrine\n(for several criticisms, see Williamson 2011, 2012). Other replies\nmight be available. Maybe the student does not represent the rule\npractically (see next section), or she is simply incapable of granting\nthat the rule applies to this case, for that would explain her failure\nto be appropriately disposed to arrive at the conclusion, given the\ntruth of the premises. (For yet other versions of the regress\nchallenge, see No\u00eb 2005: 285\u20136 and Hetherington 2006).\n2. The Sufficiency Argument\n\nThe claim that knowledge-how is a kind of knowledge-that encounters an\nimmediate incredulous stare: how could propositional knowledge be\nsufficient for knowing how to do something? Ryle (1946: 5) himself\nposes this challenge as a starting point for his argument: \n\n\nObviously there is no truth or set of truths of which we could say\n\u201cIf only the stupid player had been informed of them, he would\nbe a clever player\u201d, or \u201cWhen once he had been apprised of\nthese truths he would play well\u201d.\n\n\nCertainly, one might know all the propositions that are relevant to\nhow to perform a task, and yet fail to know how to perform it:\nknowledge-that does not seem sufficient for knowledge-how (see also\nRyle 1940: 38\u20139). \n\nIn order to assess this objection, it is helpful to start with a toy\nintellectualist theory, on which knowledge-how is a matter of knowing,\nfor some way or method to perform a task w, that w is in\nfact a way to perform it. In\n section 4,\n we will see in more detail a linguistic argument for identifying\nknowledge-how with this sort of propositional knowledge (Stanley &\nWilliamson 2001; Snowdon 2004). How could, the insufficiency objection\ngoes, one know how to perform a task just in virtue of knowing a\nproposition about a way to perform it? Consider the following\ncounterexample to intellectualism:\n\n\nSwimming: Suppose I look at a swimmer\u2019s\nswimming, and my swimming instructor pointing to the swimmer says to\nme, \u201cThat is a way in which you could swim too\u201d. I believe\nmy instructor and we may suppose that what she said is in fact true. I\nmay thereby come to know a true answer to the question \u201cHow\ncould I swim?\u201d However, in the relevant sense, I may not have\ncome to know how to swim. If I took a swimming test, I might still\nfail it. If thrown in the swimming pool, I might still drown. I do not\nknow how to swim in the relevant sense and yet I do know a true\nproposition about how to swim.\n\n\nIn response to this sort of counterexample, intellectualists often\nappeal to \u201cpractical modes of presentation\u201d: knowing a\nproposition observationally or demonstratively is not the same as\nknowing it practically. Knowledge-how is, at least in part, a matter\nof representing propositions about tasks and ways of executing tasks\nin a distinctively practical fashion. For one to know how to swim, in\nthe relevant sense, one must know of a way to swim represented under a\ndistinctive practical mode of presentation, which is essentially\ndifferent from the observational or demonstrative mode of presentation\nin Swimming. This kind of practically represented\npropositional knowledge is what (some) intellectualists call\nknowledge-how and is what is absent in the example above.\n\nThe notion of practical modes of presentation has received several\ncriticisms (Schiffer 2002; Koethe 2002; No\u00eb 2005; Fantl 2011;\nGlick 2015), on the ground that it seems excessively obscure or even\nquestion begging. Koethe (2002: 327) worries that practical modes of\npresentation smuggle in an antecedent notion of knowledge-how (though\nsee Fantl 2008: 461 for a response). This widespread skepticism about\npractical modes of presentation has led some intellectualists to\nexplore ways of responding to the insufficiency objection that do not\nappeal to practical modes of presentation. For example, Stanley\n(2011b: 126) considers answering the sufficiency challenge in\nSwimming by appealing to the context-sensitivity of\nthe ability modal \u201ccould\u201d. According to Stanley, depending\non how the context for the modal is restricted, \u201cThat is how you\ncould swim\u201d could mean either that that is how you can swim\ngiven your current physical state or that that is how you\ncould swim after training. But coming to know that that is\nhow I could swim after training is clearly not enough for me to come\nto know how to swim now. Instead, the argument goes, what one needs to\nknow is the former proposition: that that is a way to swim given\nmy current physical state.\n\nYet, it is unclear that even this response works. Consider a variant\nof the previous scenario, where Mary is a skilled swimmer who is one\nday affected by memory loss and so forgets how she is able to swim\n(Glick 2015). Nothing has changed in Mary\u2019s physical state: she\nis still able to swim but she just has forgotten how she is able to\nswim. Suppose she is told, by looking at a recording of her swimming\nthe day before, that that is how she can in fact swim given\nher current physical state. She might come to know how she is in fact\nable to swim (just like that!). Yet, she would still fail to know how\nto swim in the relevant sense and still drown if thrown into the pool.\n\n\nSo, practical modes of representation are hard to escape if\nintellectualism is to be defended against the sufficiency objection.\nTo assuage concerns about the intelligibility of practical modes of\npresentation, Pavese (2015b) proposes we think of them along the lines\nof practical senses, which in turn can be modeled after computer\nprograms. Programs determine an output, just like Fregean senses\ndetermine a referent; and they are practical in that they break down a\ntask into the smallest parts that the system can execute (the\nprimitive operations of the system as well as into primitive ways of\ncombining those parts) so they ground the ability to perform a complex\ntask in terms of the ability to perform all of its parts. On this\nview, if one represents a task practically, one represents all of its\nparts, and the combination of those parts, through instructions that\none has the ability to execute. So representing practically a task\nentails that one has the ability to perform the corresponding task.\n(For a critical discussion of practical ways of thinking, see Mosdell\n2019. Habgood-Coote 2018c argues that the classical generality problem\nfor reliabilism (Feldman 1985; Conee & Feldman 1998) arises for\nintellectualism.)\n\nThe notion of distinctively practical concepts is motivated by work\noutside the debate on intellectualism about knowledge-how. Other\nscholars have discussed concepts that are practical in that they\ndissociate from semantic and observational concepts and play a central\nrole in explaining behavior. Peacocke (1986: 49\u201350) talks of\n\u201caction-based ways of thinking\u201d, Israel, Perry,and Tutiya\n(1993: 534) of \u201cexecutable ideas\u201d, and Pacherie (2000,\n2006) of \u201caction concepts\u201d. Mylopoulous and Pacherie\n(2017) suggest that executable action concepts might be needed to\novercome the interface problem\u2014the problem of how cognitive\nrepresentations (intentions) interact with motor representations\n(Butterfill & Sinigaglia 2014). Pavese (forthcoming-b) advances an\nempirical-functional case for practical concepts, arguing that they\nare needed to explain a distinctive sort of productive reasoning. Yet,\nother intellectualists argue we can dispense with practical modes of\npresentation altogether and instead appeal to ways of knowing\nthat are distinctively practical or executive (Waights Hickman 2019;\nCath 2020).\n\nLevy (2017) argues that a form of intellectualism that only invokes\npractical ways of thinking and practical concepts might not be able to\nexplain skillful motor behavior, for motor representations of the sort\nrequired for skilled action and posited by cognitive psychologists are\nnon-conceptual. Along similar lines, Fridland (2014, 2017) argues\nmotor control and motor representation cannot be countenanced by\nStanley & Williamson\u2019s (2001) and Stanley\u2019s (2011b)\nforms of intellectualism. So, more promising forms of intellectualism\nmight have to invoke, in addition to practical ways of thinking,\nnon-conceptual practical representations (Pavese 2019;\nKrakauer 2020). Just like perceptual concepts are distinguished from\nnon-conceptual perceptual representations, we might distinguish\nbetween practical conceptual representations and practical\nnon-conceptual representations. Motor representations would fall under\nthe latter heading. Nonconceptual motor representations also represent\npractically, as they break down a task in terms of the most basic\noperations that a system can perform.\n3. The Gradability Argument\n\nRyle (1949: 46) formulates the argument from gradability thus: \n\n\nwe never speak of a person having partial knowledge of a fact or truth\n\u2026 it is proper and normal to speak of a person knowing in part\nhow to do something. Learning how or improving in ability is not like\nlearning that or acquiring information. Truths can be imparted,\nprocedures can only be inculcated, and while inculcation is a gradual\nprocess, imparting is relatively sudden.\n\n\nAs Kremer (2020: 102) points out, here Ryle is making two\ndistinguishable points: (i) ascriptions of knowledge-how are gradable,\nwhereas ascriptions of know-that are not; (ii) the gradability of\nthese ascriptions is explained by the fact that knowledge-how must\ncome in degrees, because learning-how brings improvement in\nknowledge-how. There is no parallel phenomenon in learning-that, and\nso no need for degrees of knowledge-that. Others have followed Ryle in\nthinking that the gradability argument shows intellectualism wrong.\nFor example, Bengson and Moffett (2011b) argue that because\nknowledge-how is gradable, knowledge-how is more similar to\nacquaintance knowledge, which also comes in degrees (see also Ryle\n1949: 46; Wiggins 2012; Santorio 2016; Kremer 2020: 102). \n\nPavese (2017) distinguishes between two kinds of gradability of\nknowledge-how ascriptions: one might know how to do something in part\nor entirely (quantitative gradability) or one might know how to do\nsomething better than somebody else (qualitative gradability).\nCrucially, these two kinds of gradability are also present more\ngenerally in other knowledge-wh (knowledge-when, who, why, where)\nascriptions, which do seem to reduce to propositional knowledge. For\ninstance, one might know in part who came to the party\n(Lahiri 1991, 2000; Roberts 2009) or know a better answer to that\nquestion than somebody else (see also Stanley 2011b: 31\u20135). If\nparts of an answer are propositions, then knowing an answer might\nstill amount to knowledge of all of its parts. Knowing in part an\nanswer would then amount to knowing at least one of the propositions\nthat is part of that answer. Similarly, knowing a better answer\namounts to knowing a proposition that better answers the relevant\nquestion. If this is true of other knowledge-wh ascriptions, it is\ncertainly plausible that it is true for knowledge-how. One might know\nhow to \u03a6 in part by knowing only certain (propositional) parts of\nthe answer to \u201chow does one \u03a6?\u201d and one might know a\nbetter answer to that question than someone else. \n\nThis response to the first part of the gradability objection inspires\na further response to the second part concerning learning-how. Suppose\nthat knowledge-how is a matter of knowing a practical answer, where a\npractical answer encompasses a practical representation for a task or\na way to \u03a6\n (section 2).\n As we have seen, practically representing requires possessing certain\npractical capacities and entails certain sorts of abilities. On this\npicture, one might gradually learn how to perform a task by gradually\nlearning a practical answer to that question, for one requires time\nand practice to master a practical representation of how to perform\nthe task. Thus, gradual learning may be compatible with the\nintellectualist picture, if it amounts to gradually coming to learn\nmore parts of a practical answer.\n4. The Linguistic Argument\n\nIntellectualism has been motivated on the basis of a linguistic\nargument concerning knowledge-how ascriptions in English (Vendler\n1972; Stanley & Williamson 2001; Snowdon 2004; Stanley 2011b,\n2011c). Begin by noticing that (1) is remarkably similar to\n(2)\u2013(3) (\u201cfinite knowledge wh ascriptions\u201d as they\nembed a complement with a finitival verb) and to (4)\u2013(5)\n(\u201cinfinitive knowledge-wh ascriptions\u201d as they embed a\ncomplement with an infinitival verb):\n\n(1)\n Marie knows how to play the piano\n(2) \n Mary knows where her piano is located in the house.\n(3) \n Mary knows who can play her piano.\n(4) \n Mary knows what to do in case of an emergency.\n(5) \n Mary knows where to find an Italian newspaper.\n\n\nAccording to the standard syntactic analysis, (2)\u2013(5) have an\ninterrogative as complement\u2014\u201cwhere is her piano located in\nthe house?\u201d, \u201cwho can play the piano?\u201d, \u201cwhat\nto do in case of an emergency?\u201d are all interrogatives. Having\nsaid this, in broad outline, the linguistic argument for\nintellectualism has three steps. The first step is to follow the\nsyntactic cues from (1)\u2013(5) and identify the logical form of\n\u201cS knows how to \u03a6\u201d with that of \u201cS\nknows + interrogative Q (= \u201chow to \u03a6\u201d). Call\nthis premise Logical Form. The second step is to\naccept the orthodox semantics of knowledge-wh ascriptions, according\nto which in \u201cS knows + interrogative Q\u201d,\nQ denotes a question (C. Baker 1968) and according to which\n\u201cS knows + Q\u201d is true just in case S\nknows a proposition answering to the question expressed by Q.\nCall this premise Semantics for Knowledge-Wh (cf.,\namong many others, Hamblin 1958, 1973; Hintikka 1976; Karttunen 1977;\nHeim 1994; Groenendijk & Stokhof 1982, 1997; and Higginbotham\n1996). Finally, the third step is to extend this semantics to\nknowledge-how ascriptions, such that knowing how to \u03a6 requires\nknowing a proposition that answers the question \u201chow can one\n\u03a6?\u201d \n\nNext section (4.1) looks in some more detail to the intellectualist\nanalysis of the truth conditions for knowledge-how ascriptions. The\nsection after next\n (4.2)\n discusses several objections to the linguistic argument.\n4.1 The Details of the Intellectualist Proposal\n\nThe linguistic argument concludes that Intellectualism is true:\n\n\nIntellectualism about knowing how S knows how\nto \u03a6 just in case S knows a proposition answering the\nquestion \u201chow to \u03a6\u201d.\n\n\nBut what is the proposition that one knows by knowing how to \u03a6?\n\n\nFirst, note that the subject of the infinitival construction\n(\u201cHow to \u03a6\u201d), or PRO, can either be interpreted de\nse (de se PRO) or generically (generic PRO). According\nto the first interpretation, that an agent knows how to perform a ski\nstunt requires their knowing how to perform a ski stunt\nthemselves. According to the latter interpretation, it\nrequires knowing how one (as a generic agent or any other\nagent) would perform a ski stunt. When it comes to ascriptions of\nknowledge-how, we care about de se, and not generic, readings\nof knowing how. If an agent knows how to \u03a6 in the relevant sense,\nthey know how to \u03a6 themselves. \n\nSecondly, infinitival interrogatives such as \u201chow to\n\u03a6\u201d and \u201cwhat to \u03a6\u201d are ambiguous between a\ndeontic reading (how to \u03a6 = how one should\n\u03a6; what to \u03a6 = what one should do) and an\nability reading (how to \u03a6 = how one could \u03a6;\nwhat to \u03a6 = what one could do). The deontic\nreading does not seem relevant when we ascribe knowledge-how. Hence\nthe relevant reading must be an ability reading. Joining these two\ndisambiguations, the truth conditions of knowledge-how ascriptions are\n(cf. Schroeder 2012):\n\n\n(Truth conditions) \u201cS knows how to\n\u03a6\u201d is true just in case S knows a proposition\nanswering the question \u201cHow could they themselves\n\u03a6?\u201d\n\n\nNow, what counts as an answer to the question? Linguists distinguish\nbetween different kinds of answers that one might give to a question.\nAn exhaustive answer to \u201cHow could S\n\u03a6?\u201d would specify all the ways in which S could\n\u03a6; a mention-some answer, instead, would specify only one\nway in which S could \u03a6. For example, an exhaustive answer\nto the question \u201cHow could S make pasta?\u201d would\nspecify all different recipes for making pasta. A mention-some answer\nto the same question, instead, would specify (at least) only one\nrecipe. When we ascribe knowledge-how, we don\u2019t expect people to\nknow all the possible ways of performing the relevant task. For\nexample, \u201cMary knows how to make pasta\u201d can be true, even\nif Mary only knows one recipe for pasta. This gives us the following\ntruth conditions:\n\n\nIntellectualism* \u201cS knows how to\n\u03a6\u201d is true just in case S knows, for some way w\nof \u03a6-ing, that w is a way he himself could\n\u03a6.\n\n\nAs we have seen in\n section 2,\n in addition to knowing that a way to \u03a6 is a way to \u03a6, one\nneeds to think of that way under a practical mode of presentation. Let\nPr be a practical way of thinking of a way and let way\nof \u03a6-ing be a way of thinking of the property of\nbeing a way of \u03a6-ing; finally let \u29bc be a way of composing\nways of thinking into a proposition. Then <Pr \u29bc way\nof \u03a6-ing> is the practical proposition that one\ncomes to know when coming to know how to \u03a6. On how to implement\nFregean senses in the compositional semantics, see Yalcin (2015).\n4.2 First Group of Objections\n\nSeveral philosophers have objected that intellectualists are giving\nundue weight to linguistic considerations and that other\nconsiderations, coming from the cognitive sciences, should be taken\ninto account too, when thinking about the nature of knowledge-how\n(No\u00eb 2005, 2011; Devitt 2011; Brown 2013; Johnson 2006; Glick\n2011; Roth & Cummins 2011). It does not follow from this worry\nthat the linguistic argument ought to be dismissed as lacking\nany evidential value. Consider an analogy. Arguably, the best\ntheory of beliefs and desires is one on which these are propositional\nattitudes. This theory is compatible with how we ascribe beliefs and\ndesires (i.e., ascriptions of beliefs are of the form \u201cS\nbelieves that p\u201d, where \u201cp\u201d is\nstandardly taken to stand for proposition). But it is also compatible\nwith folk psychology, according to which thinking of beliefs and\ndesires as propositional attitudes helps explain behavior. By parity\nof reasoning, ideally, the best theory of knowledge-how should\npresumably be compatible both with our best psychological\ntheory and our best linguistic theory of knowledge-how ascriptions\n(cf. Stanley 2011a, 2011b, 2011c; Cath 2015a for a defense of the\nlinguistic methodology). \n4.3 Second Group of Objections\n\nAmong those engaging with the linguistic argument, many have objected\nthat it fails to adequately capture the truth conditions of\nknowledge-how ascriptions (Roberts 2009; Brogaard 2009, 2011;\nMichaelis 2011; Bengson & Moffett 2011a; Ginzburg 2011; Abbott\n2013; Santorio 2016; Hornsby 2016). Some have argued against the claim\nthat knowledge-wh is a matter of knowing a proposition that answers a\nquestion (Semantics for knowledge-wh). For example,\nCarr (1979, 1981) argues that when you know how to do something, you\nhave an attitude that essentially takes an act as its object. But when\nyou know that something is the case, you have an attitude that\nessentially takes a proposition as its object. Yet, intellectualists\nmight reply that knowledge-how might be an attitude towards an act\nin virtue of being an attitude towards a proposition about\nthat act. \n\nOthers have questioned whether the complement \u201cwhich team is\nwinning\u201d in \u201cS knows which team is winning\u201d\nis, semantically, just like an interrogative (Brogaard 2009, 2011;\nGinzburg 1995a, 1995b, 1996, 2011; Ginzburg & Sag 2000). One\nargument against this assumption is that, if, e.g., \u201cwhich team\nis winning\u201d denoted a question, we would expect it to co-refer\nwith \u201cthe question of which team is winning\u201d. Yet we\ncannot substitute such expression-pairs salva veritate.\nSuppose Jenny knows/discovered/revealed an interesting question and\nsuppose the interesting question discovered by Jenny is \u201cwho\nleft yesterday?\u201d. Even so, it does not follow that Jenny\nknows/discovered/revealed who left yesterday. A response to this\nobjection might be that these examples exploit a subtle equivocation\n(Stanley 2011b: ch. 2, following King 2002). Consider \u201cJamaal\ndiscovered a new element\u201d. In it, \u201cdiscovered\u201d\ndenotes a relation between Jamaal and an object, a chemical element.\nOn the other hand, in the sentence \u201cJamaal discovered who left\nyesterday\u201d, \u201cdiscovered\u201d denotes a different\nrelation, one that holds between Jamaal and something of a different\nsort, namely, the proposition answering the question expressed by\n\u201cwho left yesterday\u201d. It is this second relation which is\nrelevant for the intellectualist. This is supported by the fact that\nthe \u201c[t]he former relation would be expressed in German by\n\u2018kennen\u2019, and the latter by\n\u2018wissen\u2019\u201d (Stanley 2011b: 66). (For more\nrelevant discussion, see Parent 2014.)\n\nOthers have questioned Logical form\u2014the claim\nthat in knowledge-how ascriptions, the embedded complement is an\ninterrogative. Objectualists claim that the complement of\nknowledge-how ascriptions (\u201chow to \u03a6\u201d) is not an\ninterrogative but an \u201cobjectual\u201d complement\u2014one\ndenoting ways to \u03a6 instead of propositions representing these ways\n(Bengson & Moffett 2011a). Objectualism is motivated by the\nconsideration that \u201cknowing how to \u03a6\u201d seems to be\nequivalent to \u201cknowing a way to \u03a6\u201d in pretty much\nevery context and by the apparent gradability of\n\u201cknows-how\u201d ascriptions (cf.\n section 3).\n An objectual semantics is in a good place to explain the gradability\nof knowledge-how ascriptions, since objectual knowledge ascriptions\nalso permit degree modifiers\u2014one can have partial knowledge of\nParis, or know Paris better than someone else. Along similar lines,\nBach (2012) and Abbott (2013) argue that in knowledge-how ascriptions\n\u201chow to \u03a6\u201d might work as a free relative. A\nfree relative is a wh-phrase that denotes an individual. So for\nexample, \u201cwhat I was given for dinner\u201d can be used as an\ninterrogative in \u201cI asked what I was given for dinner\u201d but\nalso as a free relative in \u201cI ate what I was given for\ndinner\u201d. In the latter ascription, it denotes some food that was\ngiven to me for dinner. In that sense, \u201chow to \u03a6\u201d\naccording to this proposal, in \u201cS knows how to\n\u03a6\u201d should be interpreted as a free relative denoting a way\nto \u03a6, rather than an answer to the question \u201chow to\n\u03a6?\u201d \n\nTo this proposal, some respond that knowledge-how ascriptions do not\npass the standard tests for detecting free relative complements\n(Schaffer 2009: 486\u201391; Habgood-Coote 2018a). Take the\ncoordinated use of knowledge-how and other knowledge-wh ascriptions in\n\u201cS has always known how to swim and never has wondered\nhow\u201d. This coordination suggests that both kinds of ascriptions\nhave an interrogative as a complement (Bresnan & Grimshaw 1978:\n332; M. Baker 1996: 204\u20137). Further, knowledge-how ascriptions\ncan be extended to embed a multiple interrogative, as in \u201cMark\nknows how to do what?\u201d , whereas free relative complements do\nnot tolerate multiple wh-phrases (C. Baker 1968; Bresnan &\nGrimshaw 1978: 335). Moreover, infinitival wh phrases, such as\n\u201cwhat to do\u201d, \u201chow to do\u201d, \u201cwho to\nask\u201d never allow for free relative reading (Huddleston &\nPullum 2002: 1070\u20133). Finally, a standard test for telling apart\nfree relatives and interrogatives is to see if they embed under\n\u201cbelieve\u201d, for \u201cbelieve\u201d does not take\ninterrogatives as complements but it does tolerate free relatives.\n(For example, \u201cMark believed who was charged guilty\u201d\ncannot mean \u201cMark believed the answer to the question \u201cWho\nwas charged guilty?\u201d\u201d. Rather, it means that Mark believed\nthe person who was charged guilty.) However, interestingly,\n\u201cbelieve\u201d can never embed infinitival constructions such\nas \u201cwhat to do\u201d, \u201chow to do\u201d, or \u201cwho to\nask\u201d. \n\nFinally, some have questioned whether Semantics for\nknowledge-wh applies to ascriptions embedding infinitival\ncomplements, like knowledge-how ascriptions. Roberts (2009) argues\nthat, as opposed to other wh complements, the meaning of\n\u201chow\u201d denotes a property rather than a proposition when\nembedded in infinitival clauses. Santorio (2016) defends a Gibbardian\nsemantics for knowledge ascriptions embedding infinitive\ninterrogatives, on which these ascriptions ascribe maximal performance\nplans compatible with an agent\u2019s plans (for more objections to\nSemantics for knowledge-wh, see also Sgaravatti &\nZardini 2008 and George 2013).\n4.4 Third Group of Objections\n\nThe perhaps most serious objection to the linguistic argument is that\nit ignores cross-linguistic evidence about how knowledge-how is\nascribed in languages other than English (Rumfitt 2003; Roberts 2009;\nGlick 2012; Wiggins 2012; Abbott 2013; Douskos 2013; Ditter 2016).\nRumfitt (2003) argues that the linguistic facts on behalf of\nintellectualism are overstated. Many languages\u2014e.g., French,\nItalian, Spanish, and Russian\u2014ascribe knowledge-how not just\nthrough ascriptions embedding interrogatives (\u201cS knows\nhow to \u03a6\u201d) but also through ascriptions embedding bare\ninfinitivals (\u201cS knows + (bare infinitive) to\n\u03a6\u201d (= \u201cS knows to \u03a6\u201d)) as in\n\u201cMarie sait nager\u201d and \u201cMaria sa\nnuotare\u201d. Stanley (2011b, 2011c) responds that these\nascriptions are to be analyzed as embedding an implicit\ninterrogative\u2014one where the question word \u201chow\u201d is\nnot explicitly articulated. However, Abbott (2013), Hornsby (2016),\nand Ditter (2016) have observed that this response does not help with\nyet other languages, such as Russian, in which knowledge-how\nascriptions\u2014of the form \u201cS (attitude verb)\nVs + (infinitive) to \u03a6\u201d\u2014feature an embedding\nverb V (\u201cumetj\u201d) that never\nlicenses an interrogative complement nor a declarative complement\n(i.e., a that-clause). \n\nIn order to assess what this cross-linguistic evidence really\nestablishes, consider a new version of the linguistic argument. Let\n\u201cS Vs \u03a6\u201d be an ascription of\nknowledge-how in an arbitrary language L that is correctly\ntranslated in English by \u201cS knows + (interrogative) how\n(de se) to \u03a6\u201d. Assuming that translation preserves\nat least truth conditions, \u201cS Vs \u03a6\u201d will\nbe true in L just in case \u201cS knows +\n(interrogative) how (de se) to \u03a6\u201d is true in\nEnglish. Call this the Interpretation Premise. By the\nDisquotational Schema, \u201cS knows how to \u03a6\u201d is\ntrue in English just in case S knows how to \u03a6; so, we have\nthat \u201cS Vs \u03a6\u201d is true in L just\nin case S knows how to \u03a6. This conclusion, together with\nthe Semantics for knowledge wh, the Logical\nForm, and the Interpretation Premise, yields\nthat \u201cS Vs \u03a6\u201d is true in L just\nin case S bears a knowledge relation towards an answer to the\nquestion \u201cHow he himself could \u03a6\u201d. Through this\nargument, the truth conditions of any knowledge-how ascription,\nwhether in English or in any other language, are reduced to\npropositional knowledge, whether the relevant knowledge-how ascription\nhas or not the interrogative form. \n\nProponents of the cross-linguistic argument might challenge\nLogical Form: the different ways of ascribing\nknowledge-how (through the infinitival form and through the\ninterrogative form) in these languages indicate that knowledge-how\nascriptions in English are ambiguous between two not\ntruth-conditionally equivalent logical forms: an interrogative form\nand a bare infinitival form (Ambiguity Hypothesis) (Rumfitt\n2003; Wiggins 2012; Setiya 2012; Glick 2012; Ditter 2016; Hornsby\n2016). The main piece of evidence for the Ambiguity\nHypothesis is that in languages employing both the interrogative\nform and the infinitival form, those different ascriptions\ncan come apart in their truth conditions. For example, it is\nclaimed that the Italian sentence \u201cMario sa come\nnuotare\u201d (interrogative form = \u201cMario knows how to\nswim\u201d) may be usedly true, while the sentence \u201cMario\nsa nuotare\u201d (infinitival form = Mario knows to swim) is\nfalse. This would be the case, for example, if Mario lacks (in some\nsense) the ability to swim (so too for its French and Spanish\ntranslations). Similarly, Ditter argues that in Russian, the\ninterrogative construction must ascribe a different state from the\n\u201cumetj\u201d ascription (+ infinitival), on the ground\nthat one can coherently use in Russian sentences of the following\nform:\n\n(6)\n\n\nJohn znaet kak igrat\u2019 na pianino, no on ne umeyet\nigrat.\n\nJohn knows + (interrogative) how to play the piano, but he does not\nknow (\u201cumetj\u201d) + (infinitival) to play the\npiano.\n\n\u201cJohn knows how to play the piano, but he doesn\u2019t know how\nto do it\u201d. \n\n\nAccording to these authors, this difference between interrogative\nembedding constructions and infinitival embedding construction shows\nup also in English locally for the verb learn:\n\u201cS learnt to swim\u201d differs from \u201cS\nlearnt how to swim\u201d in that the former, but not the latter, is\nability-entailing (Rumfitt 2003; Glick 2012).\n\nThis argument for the Ambiguity Hypothesis might be in\ncertain ways too quick. The only way to make\n (6)\n intelligible in English is to translate it as (7), where the generic\ninterpretation of the first knowledge-how ascription and the de\nse interpretation of the second ascription are made explicit:\n\n(7)\n Mary knows how one could play the piano but does not know how to\nplay the piano herself.\n\n\nHowever,\n (6)\n cannot be interpreted as (8) on pain of contradiction:\n\n(8)\n Mary knows how she herself could play the piano but does not know\nhow to play the piano herself. \n\n\nIf so, the fact that\n (6)\n is acceptable in Russian does not establish that the interrogative\nform in Russian cannot also have an interpretation (the\nde se interpretation) on which it is truth conditionally\nequivalent to the Russian\u2019s infinitival form. Here is a\ncompetitive explanation of the available cross-linguistic evidence\nthat does not commit us to the Ambiguity Hypothesis. Just\nlike English\u2019s ascriptions, the interrogative form in Russian is\nambiguous between a de se interpretation, on which it is\ntruth conditionally equivalent to the infinitival form, and a generic\ninterpretation of the subject of the infinitival embedded verb, on\nwhich it comes apart from the infinitival form. This explains why\n (6)\n is felicitous and why it can be translated as (7) but not as (8). On\nthis explanation, this evidence might be compatible with English\nknowledge-how ascriptions univocally having the same logical form (the\ninterrogative form), even though the embedded interrogative can\nreceive either the generic or the de se interpretation,\ndepending on the subject of the infinitival embedded verb.\n5. The Action Theory Argument and the Question of Joint Action\n\nRyle is often interpreted as claiming that knowledge-how ascriptions\nare nothing more than ascriptions of an ability or a complex of\ndispositions to act in a skilled or intelligent manner (though see\nHornsby 2011: 82 and Waights Hickman 2019 for dissent). This\ninterpretation is based on passages in the Concept of Mind,\nsuch as the following:\n\n\nWhen a person is described by one or other of the intelligence\nepithets such as \u201cshrewd\u201d or \u201csilly\u201d,\n\u201cprudent\u201d or \u201cimprudent\u201d, the description\nimputes to him not the knowledge or ignorance of this or that truth,\nbut the ability, or inability, to do certain sorts of things. (Ryle\n1949: 27)\n\n\nEarly intellectualists argued that knowledge-how does not entail\nability (Ginet 1975; Stanley & Williamson 2001; Snowdon 2004). For\nexample, a pianist who lost their arms in a car accident may have lost\nher ability to play but still preserve her knowledge-how to play the\npiano (cf. Snowdon\u2019s 2004: 8 expert omelette maker); or a ski\ninstructor might know how to do a ski stunt and, according to Stanley\n& Williamson (2001), still fail to have the ability to do it. By\ncontrast, anti-intellectualists argue that it is important to\ndistinguish between knowing how to perform a task, which corresponds\nto a general ability, and being (actually and circumstantially) able\nto perform it (No\u00eb 2005; Glick 2012; Setiya 2012). So the pianist\nmight have both general ability as well as knowledge-how, though they\nlack circumstantial ability. By contrast, the ski instructor does not\nclearly have knowledge-how to perform the ski stunt themselves, while\nthey know how one, in general, can do it. Recent\nintellectualist views also take knowledge-how to go together with\nabilities (understood along Hawley\u2019s 2003 notion of\ncounterfactual success) and argue that rightly construed\nintellectualism can vindicate this connection (Pavese 2015b; Cath\n2020). \n\nYet, everybody agrees that while knowledge-how might entail ability,\nability is not sufficient for knowledge-how, as demonstrated by an\nexample from Hawley (2003):\n\n\nAnnoyance. Susie is attempting to annoy Joe; she\nthinks smoking will do the trick. Whenever she smokes, she\nunconsciously and inadvertently taps on her cigarette pack.\nUnbeknownst to Susie, Joe does not mind cigarette smoke, but finds her\ntapping obnoxious.\n\n\nSusie has the ability to annoy Joe, since she has the disposition to\nannoy Joe whenever she attempts to do so. But, intuitively, she does\nnot know how to annoy him. A natural explanation of this is that she\ncannot annoy him intentionally (for structurally similar\ncases, see Carr 1979, 1981 and Bengson, Moffett, & Wright 2009).\nPretty much all sides of the dispute agree on the following claim\n(Ryle 1949; Stanley & Williamson 2001; Hawley 2003; Hornsby 2004,\n2011; Stanley 2011b; Setiya 2012):\n\n\n(Knowledge-how/Intentionality): If S intentionally\n\u03a6s, S knows how to \u03a6.\n\n\nMany also endorse the biconditional (Knowledge-how/Ability\nIntentional) (Hawley 2003; Setiya 2012):\n\n\n(Knowledge-how/Ability Intentional): S has the ability\nto intentionally \u03a6 if and only if S knows how to \u03a6.\n\n\n\nNow, suppose that knowing how to \u03a6 does require the ability to\nintentionally perform \u03a6. If so, whether knowledge-how requires a\npropositional attitude depends on whether or not one can intentionally\n\u03a6 without having a propositional attitude about how to \u03a6. But\naccording to many influential views of intentional action,\nintentionally \u03a6-ing does require a propositional attitude, namely\na belief about how to \u03a6. In particular, intentionally \u03a6-ing\nrequires having an action plan, which is characterizable in terms of a\nbelief about how to perform \u03a6. For example, on Goldman\u2019s\n(1970) view, one intentionally \u03a6s when one has a plan to \u03a6,\nwhere a plan to \u03a6 is a belief that specifies the means to \u03a6\n(see, also, e.g., Harman 1976; Audi 1986; Bratman 1987; Velleman 1989;\nGinet 1990; Mele & Moser 1994; Gibbons 2001). From this, we\nget:\n\n\n(Intentionality/Belief): If S intentionally \u03a6s,\nthen there are some means \\(m_1\\), \u2026, \\(m_n\\) to \u03a6 such\nthat S truly believes that \\(m_1\\), \u2026, \\(m_n\\) are means\nfor oneself to \u03a6.\n\n\nSome intellectualists have argued on these bases that knowledge-how to\n\u03a6 requires at least a propositional attitude about the means to\n\u03a6 (Cath 2015b).\n\nBut is propositional knowledge of means to ends required for\nintentional action, over and above true belief? Gibbons (2001)\nprovides several examples to buttress the necessity of knowledge for\nintentional action. For example, one cannot plausibly intentionally\nwin a fair lottery , nor can one intentionally defuse a bomb if one\nunintentionally and fortuitously chooses the correct wire; in both\ncases, a plausible explanation for the lack of intentionality is that\nthe subjects does not have the relevant propositional knowledge about\nhow to accomplish those tasks. These cases buttress the claim that\nintentional action requires knowledge of the means to execute it:\n\n\n(Intentionality/Knowledge): If S intentionally \u03a6s,\nthen there are some means \\(m_1\\), \u2026, \\(m_n\\) to \u03a6 such\nthat s knows that \\(m_1\\), \u2026, \\(m_n\\) are means for oneself to\n\u03a6.\n\n\nWith these assumptions in the background, here is a non-linguistic\nargument for intellectualism. Start from\n(Knowledge-how/Intentionality): if S intentionally\n\u03a6s, S knows how to \u03a6. Furthermore, suppose that\n(Intentionality/Knowledge) is true so that the intentionality\nof an action is to be explained at least in part in terms of\npropositional knowledge. Then, by these two premises, we get that if\none intentionally \u03a6s, one both knows how to \u03a6 and one has\npropositional knowledge of the means to \u03a6:\n\n\n(Knowledge-how, Intentionality, Knowledge): If S\nintentionally \u03a6s, S both knows how to \u03a6 and for some\nmeans \\(m_1\\), \u2026, \\(m_n\\), S knows that means \\(m_1\\) ,\n\u2026, \\(m_n\\) are means for oneself to \u03a6.\n\n\nNow, according to standard formulations of intellectualism, one knows\nhow to \u03a6 only if, for some means m to \u03a6, one knows that\nm is a means for one to \u03a6:\n\n\n(Intellectualism about Knowledge-How): S knows how to\n\u03a6 is at least in part of a matter of knowing, for some means\nm to \u03a6, S knows that m is a means for oneself\nto \u03a6.\n\n\nSo, the argument from intentional action for intellectualism maintains\nthat the intellectualist picture provides the best explanation for why\n(Knowledge-How, Intentionality, Knowledge) should hold.\nAccording to this explanation, (Knowledge-How, Intentionality,\nKnowledge) is true not just because of a coincidental alignment\nof propositional knowledge and knowledge-how in intentional action.\nRather, its truth is grounded on the very nature of knowledge-how: one\nknows how to \u03a6 in virtue of knowing, for some means\nm to \u03a6, that m is a means for oneself to \u03a6. \n\nThe view that intentional action requires belief has been challenged\nfor the particular case of basic actions. Setiya (2012)\nobserves that one can perform a basic action of clenching one\u2019s\nfist without even having the belief that one can succeed at doing it.\nFor example, someone might have had a paralyzing injury, fail to\nbelieve they have healed, and still form the intention to clench their\nfist. Intellectualists might reply that, although that subject does\nnot believe that one will succeed, they might have a sufficiently high\ncredence and that credence can amount to knowledge too (Pavese 2020).\n(For other possible responses to the idea that intentional action\nrequires knowledge or belief, see Elzinga forthcoming).\n\nA further related question is how to think of knowledge-how in the\ncase of joint actions. When two agents act jointly towards a goal, as\nwhen they row a boat together, they responsively coordinate and\nmonitor each other\u2019s movements in ways that produce a joint\naction. What kind of knowledge-how is manifested by successful joint\naction? It must be possible for the agents to coordinate without each\nhaving to know the different ways in which each must act to achieve\ntheir common goals: you and I can jointly make risotto even if I do\nnot know how to season it and you do. Correspondingly, Birch (2019)\nsuggests that joint knowledge-how must be accounted for\ndistributively. If this is correct, then the agents can\njointly know how to do something without each having a belief\nabout how they jointly do it, but only in virtue of having a\ncollective, or group, belief about how to do it. (For more discussion\non group knowledge-how, see Palermos & Tollefsen 2018 and\nStrachan, Knoblich & Sebanz 2020)\n6. The Epistemology of Knowledge-How\n6.1 Knowledge-how and Belief\n\nSome have observed that knowledge-how may differ from propositional\nknowledge in that, whereas the latter plausibly entails belief,\nknowledge-how does not (Dreyfus 1991, 2005; Wallis 2008; Brownstein\n& Michaelson 2016). For example, consider Brownstein &\nMichaelson (2016)\u2019s example. When catching a ball, ball players\nmake anticipatory saccades to shift their gaze ahead of the ball one\nor more times during the course of its flight towards them. These\nplayers know how to catch a ball, and their way of catching a ball\nrequires making anticipatory saccades when watching the ball as it\nfalls. Yet, the players do not believe that making anticipatory\nsaccades is part of how they catch the ball. Rather they believe that\nthey are tracking the ball the whole time. However, from the fact that\nthe subject has false beliefs about how she catches the ball, it does\nnot follow that the subject does not also have correct\nbeliefs about it. So, a natural response is that there is\nsome sense in which the player correctly believes that his\nmanner of tracking the ball has a chance of resulting in success. \n\nWhether this response is compelling might depend on what one takes\nbeliefs to be. On this topic, philosophers widely disagree. On an\n\u201cintellectualist\u201d account of belief, on which believing\nthat p requires the subject to acknowledge that p, it is\nimplausible that the athletes have the relevant belief. But\nintellectualists about knowledge-how might advocate replacing this\nintellectual notion of belief with a less demanding one. According to\na prominent functional characterization of belief, to believe that\np entails being disposed to act in ways that would tend to\nsatisfy one\u2019s desires, whatever they are, in a world in which\np (together with one\u2019s other beliefs) are true\u201d\n(cf. Stalnaker 1984: 15; Stalnaker 2012). Now, suppose that in game\nafter game, Athena catches the ball using a certain method m,\nand that whenever she does so, her behavior is intentional. From this\nit seems to follow that Athena is disposed to perform the actions\nspecified by m. Since, ex hypothesi, m is a way\nof catching the ball, it follows that in all the worlds where she\nperforms these actions, she satisfies her desire of catching the ball\n(or at least is sufficiently likely to do so). By the previous\nfunctional characterization of belief, it follows that Athena believes\nthat m is a way for her to catch the ball. The lesson of this\ndebate might be, following Stalnaker (2012), that intellectualism\nabout knowledge-how is best construed as a form of\nanti-intellectualism about knowledge, belief, and the mental.\n6.2 Knowledge-How and Gettier\n\nAnother way of challenging the intellectualist claim that\nknowledge-how is a species of knowledge-that is to question whether\nknowledge-how can be Gettiered. If knowledge-how survives\nGettierization, that would be evidence that knowledge-how is not a\nspecies of knowledge-that, on the assumption that Gettiered justified\ntrue belief cannot constitute propositional knowledge (Gettier 1963).\nStanley & Williamson (2001) argue that knowledge-how cannot be\nGettiered. However, Cath (2011) responds by proposing the\nLucky Light Bulb case, where Charlie wants to learn\nhow to change a lightbulb, but he knows almost nothing about light\nfixtures or bulbs. Charlie consults The Idiot\u2019s Guide to\nEveryday Jobs. Inside, he finds an accurate set of instructions\ndescribing the shape of a light fixture and bulb, and the way to\nchange a bulb. Charlie grasps these instructions perfectly. And so\nthere is a way such that Charlie now believes truly that that way is a\nway for him to change a light bulb, namely, the way described in the\nbook. However, unbeknownst to Charlie, he is extremely lucky to have\nread these instructions, for the disgruntled author of The\nIdiot\u2019s Guide filled her book with otherwise misleading\ninstructions. Cath (2011) argues that intuitively Charlie still knows\nhow to fix the light bulb, despite his belief being Gettiered (cf.\nalso Poston 2009: 744).\n\nStanley replies that knowledge-wh in general seems to be\nGettierable and that might be explained in terms of features having to\ndo with knowing the answer. For example, consider\nHawthorne\u2019s (2000) example of a teacher giving each child in\ntheir class a note with the name of a city. \u201cVienna\u201d is\nwritten only on one of the notes. In this context, it seems true that\none child knows the correct answer to the question \u201cwhat is the\ncapital of Austria\u201d, even though the child\u2019s belief is\ntrue by luck. (Though see Carter & Pritchard 2015c for a reply\nthat while knowledge-how is similar to knowledge-that and knowledge-wh\nin that it is incompatible with intervening luck, it differs with\nthese kinds of knowledge in being compatible with environmental luck.)\nOthers still have responded that intuitions are subtle and not all of\nthem favor anti-intellectualism (Marley-Payne 2016; Pavese\nforthcoming-a). For a recent experimental study with mixed results,\nsee Carter, Pritchard, and Shepherd (2019). Hawley (2003: 28) argues\nthat knowledge-how, like propositional knowledge, requires\n\u201cwarrant\u201d on the ground that success on the basis of a\nlucky guess does not seem to manifest one\u2019s knowledge-how. A\nsimilar theoretical argument for thinking that lucky belief cannot\nsuffice for knowledge-how starts from the thesis that knowledge-how\nenters in explanations of success and that satisfactory explanations\nmust be \u201cmodally robust\u201d. From this, the argument\nconcludes that the sort of belief that robustly explains intentional\nsuccess must be knowledge, for knowledge has the relevant modal\nprofile (Sosa 1999; Williamson 2000; D. Greco 2016). Another line of\nargument starts from the observations that knowledge-how to \u03a6\nexplains the ability to intentionally \u03a6 (see\n section 4)\n and that only knowledge can explain intentional action (Gibbons 2001:\n589\u2013590). On these bases, some argue that knowledge-how cannot\nfall short of non-getteriable knowledge (Cath 2015b for objections to\nthis line of argument).\n6.3 Knowledge How, Defeasibility, and Testimony\n\nSome object that while knowledge-that can be defeated by misleading\nevidence, not so knowledge-how (see Carter & Navarro 2017 for this\nline of argument and Pavese 2021 for a reply). Finally, some object\nthat knowledge-how cannot be knowledge-that because the latter is\nacquirable by testimony and the former is not. While the following\nargument (A\u2013C) is valid, the following (i\u2013iii) is not\n(Poston 2016):\n\n Mark knows that Turin is in Northern Italy.\n Mark tells that to John, who believes him.\n John comes to know that Turin is in Northern Italy. \n\n\n Mark knows how John could swim.\n Mark tells John.\n John comes to know how to swim.\n\n\nFollowing Stanley\u2019s (2011b: 126) modal restriction proposal (cf.\n section 3),\n Cath (2017, 2019) responds that depending on how the context for the\nmodal is restricted, (i) could mean either that Mark knows\nhow John could swim given his current physical state or how\nJohn could swim after training. If only the latter, that is\nnot the sort of proposition that John needs to know in order for (iii)\nto be true: for that, John ought to know that that is how he could\nswim under his current physical state. (Though see\n section 2\n for qualms about this intellectualist strategy.) Another avenue for\nreply to the challenge from testimony may be to insist that not every\npropositional knowledge is transferable through testimony. A\ncomparison: visual knowledge that Mark murdered Tina differs in\ncontent and mode of presentation from the knowledge that of the murder\nobtained by being told by his prosecutor. The former observational\nknowledge is not transferable through mere testimony but (exactly\nbecause of that!) it is more helpful for the purpose of convicting\nMark than second-hand knowledge. That does not mean that observational\nknowledge is not propositional. Like in the case of perceptual\nknowledge, the proposition that one knows by knowing how to do\nsomething involves distinct modes of presentation of ways of doing\nthings\n (section 2,\n section 3). We should not expect propositions under this mode of\npresentation to be transferable through testimony. (For a response to\nPoston 2016, see also Peet 2019).\n7. The Argument from Cognitive Science\n7.1 The Argument\n\nThe argument from cognitive science against intellectualism starts by\npointing out that cognitive scientists distinguish between different\nkinds of cognitive systems: It is often held that the declarative\nsystem is responsible for encoding propositional knowledge,\nwhereas knowledge-how is encoded in the procedural system.\nGiven empirical evidence that the declarative and procedural systems\nare separate (about which more below), it would seem to follow that\nknowledge-how is not reducible to propositional knowledge (Wallis\n2008; Devitt 2011; Roth & Cummins 2011):\n\n\nThe Cognitive Science Argument\n\nC1\n The procedural system is distinct from the declarative\nsystem.\nC2 \n Motor knowledge-how is encoded entirely by the procedural\nsystem.\nC3 \n All propositional knowledge is encoded entirely in the\ndeclarative system.\nC4 \n Some knowledge-how does not require propositional knowledge.\n(from C1, C2, C3)\n\n\n\nThe usual evidence marshaled in favor of C1 relies on amnesiac case\nstudies (Milner 1962; see Cohen & Squire 1980 for discussion). A\ntypical example is HM. After bilateral removal of the hippocampus,\nparahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and most of the amygdala to\nrelieve debilitating symptoms of epilepsy, HM was unable to form new\nmemories of facts or events and he could no longer access memories he\nacquired in the few years leading up to his surgery. Nevertheless, it\nwas found that over 10 trials, HM tuned his motor skill to trace the\noutline of a five-pointed star based only on looking at reflection in\na mirror. Since he could not store new memories, HM\u2019s\ndeclarative knowledge of the means of performing the task did not\nchange from one trial to the next. But his performance improved. So,\nthe reasoning goes, the improvement of motor skills is governed by a\ndistinct cognitive system from that which governs the retention of\ndeclarative facts.\n\nMany embrace C2 (e.g., Lewicki, Czyzewska, & Hoffman 1987: 523;\nDevitt 2011; Wallis 2008). But some object that a closer look at the\ndetails of HM\u2019s case (as reported in Milner 1962) supports a\ndifferent diagnosis, on which knowledge-how is realized by a\ncombination of the procedural and the declarative system (Pavese 2013;\nStanley & Krakauer 2013). At the beginning of each trial, prior to\nbeing given verbal instructions on how to perform the motor task, HM\nlacked the ability to intentionally perform it: HM was able to perform\nthe motor task only after being reminded of what the task\nconsisted in. This suggests, against C2, that there was an\nimportant declarative component to HM\u2019s ability to perform the\nmotor task (for the role of declarative knowledge in skillful action,\nsee also Christensen, Sutton, & Bicknell 2019).\n7.2 Improving the Argument\n\nHere is a possible way to patch up the Argument from Cognitive Science\n(Fridland 2014, 2017; Levy 2017). Replace C2 with:\n\nC2*\n Knowledge-how is not exhausted by declarative knowledge.\n\n\nWith C2*, the argument goes on as before. Stanley & Krakauer\n(2013) seems to accept this conclusion (for more discussion and\ncritiques, see Krakauer 2019; Springle 2019; De Brigard 2019; Schwartz\n& Drayson 2019). Other intellectualists reply that this argument\nmisses the intellectualist target. Cath (2020) argues that procedural\nrepresentation might be a prerequisite for knowledge-how rather than a\nconstituent. Pavese (2019) develops an account on which procedural\nrepresentations, of the sort studied by motor scientists when giving\nan account of the procedural aspect of skill (Wolpert 1997; Jeannerod\n1997), can be understood as practical, albeit nonconceptual,\nrepresentations\u2014the sort of representations that intellectualism\nindependently requires for knowledge-how\n (section 2).\n7.3 Articulability\n\nAccording to C3, propositional knowledge corresponds to\n\u201cdeclarative\u201d knowledge\u2014to a sort of knowledge that\nis, at least in principle, verbalizable. Opponents of intellectualism\noften uses C3 in a novel argument against intellectualism: if\npropositional knowledge has to be verbalizable, then knowledge-how\ncannot be propositional knowledge, for often subjects know how to\nperform tasks even though they cannot explain how they do it (Schiffer\n2002; Devitt 2011; Adams 2009; Wallis 2008). On behalf of\nintellectualism, there do seem to be cases in which you come to know\nhow to do something precisely by consulting a manual and learning some\npropositions (see, e.g., Snowdon 2004: 12; Bengson and Moffett 2011a:\n8; and Katzoff 1984: 65ff). Moreover, it is not clear that the\nanti-intellectualist demand that propositional knowledge be always\nverbalizable is motivated. In fact, it seems to conflate knowing how\nto perform a task with knowing how to explain how the task is\nperformed (cf. Fodor 1968: 634; Stalnaker 2012). Stanley (2011b:\n161) points out that there is a sense in which knowledge-how\nis always verbalizable. A punch-drunk boxer who can at best\ndemonstratively refer to his re-enactment of the way of boxing against\nsouthpaws, and says, \u201cThis is the way I fight against a\nsouthpaw\u201d intuitively knows that this is the way he fights\nagainst southpaws. This knowledge has an essential demonstrative or\nindexical component. But the same goes for much other propositional\nknowledge like, for example, the knowledge we express by saying,\n\u201cThis is the tool for the job\u201d, or \u201cThat is going to\nbe trouble\u201d. This reply assumes that ways to execute tasks are\nostensible and as such can be picked up by a demonstrative.\nThis does not need to be so: on any single occasion, one may only act\non parts of a way. So, one will not thereby be able to pick\nup the general way one\u2019s knowledge-how is about.\nAnother reply on behalf of intellectualism is to point out that\npractical concepts for tasks differ from \u201csemantic\u201d\nconcepts for the same tasks precisely in that, even if propositional,\nthey are not necessarily verbalizable. \n7.4 Knowledge-How in Preverbal Children and Nonhuman Animals\n\nA final objection is that intellectualism overintellectualizes\nknowledge-how in a way that is incompatible with what we know about\nanimals\u2019 cognition (No\u00eb 2005; Hornsby 2007; Dreyfus 2007;\nElzinga forthcoming). According to this objection, unsophisticated and\nnon- (or pre-) linguistic agents such as babies and non-human animals\ncan know how to perform certain tasks, while lacking the concepts that\nare required for propositional knowledge. Some intellectualists\nrespond that ordinary speakers routinely also ascribe propositional\nknowledge to animals and babies, as we say that Fido knows that its\nowner is arriving or that a baby knows that their mother is present\n(Stanley & Williamson 2001). Thus, while propositional knowledge\nmay require concept possession, our ordinary knowledge ascriptions\nsuggest that we regard relatively unsophisticated agents as possessing\nthe relevant concepts. Comparative psychologists do routinely credit\nmany non-human and non-linguistic animals with the possession of\nconcepts. (See Allen & Bekoff 1999 for a comprehensive overview).\n\n\nThis response might be less plausible, though, when it comes to lower\nanimals, or insects. Here too, we might describe ants as knowing how\nto carry food back to their nest. And yet, there is less evidence from\ncognitive science that insects are capable of concepts too (though see\nGallistel & King 2009). In response, a different line of argument\nmight be more promising (cf. McDowell 2007): it does not follow from\nthe fact that we are disposed to ascribe knowledge-how to lower\nanimals that what explains their goal-directed behavior is the same\nsort of psychological state that underlies human knowledge-how and\nhuman action. For from the fact that their behavior resembles\nhumans\u2019 in some respects (for example, in its goal-directedness)\ndoes not entail that it resembles humans\u2019 skilled behavior in\nall respects that matter (for example, in the susceptibility\nof the relevant behavior to rational revision).\n8. Varieties of Anti-Intellectualism\n8.1 Revisionary Intellectualism\n\nAccording to orthodox intellectualism, knowledge-how is a species of\npropositional knowledge. Revisionary intellectualism, instead,\ncontends that although knowledge-how is a kind of knowledge-that, the\nrelevant knowledge is sui generis and differs from standard\npropositional knowledge in some important ways. For example, Brogaard\n(2009, 2011) argues that, in general, knowledge can have cognitive\nabilities or practical abilities as its justificatory grounds. In the\nlatter case, agents know in virtue of ability states that are not\nsubject to the usual epistemic constraints that characterize belief\nstates generated by cognitive abilities. Correspondingly,\nknowledge-how fits the bill for this practically grounded knowledge.\nCath (2015b) argues that we should distinguish between\ntheoretical knowledge-that and practical\nknowledge-that. The former is subject to the usual epistemic\nconstraints, like being sensitive to Gettierization (cf. also Zardini\n2013). The latter, instead, is not sensitive to the usual epistemic\nconstraints of theoretical knowledge-that\u2014and can therefore\nconstitute knowledge-that even if Gettierized. Waights Hickman (2019)\nsuggests that knowledge-how is a distinct kind of knowledge-that\nrelation, characterized by knowing something in \u201cthe executive\nway\u201d, which requires \n\n\npossession of (a) dispositions to attend to features of an\naction-context on which one\u2019s knowledge (how) bears; and (b)\ndispositions to adjust one\u2019s use of that knowledge accordingly.\n(2019: 333).\n\n\nAs we have seen\n (section 4),\n Bengson & Moffett (2007, 2011b) defend Non-propositional (or\nObjectualist) Intellectualism. On this view, knowing how to \u03a6\nnecessarily involves having objectual knowledge of a way of\n\u03a6-ing but having objectual knowledge of a way of \u03a6-ing is not\nsufficient to know how to \u03a6. For example, a tropical swimmer may\nbe acquainted with a way of escaping an avalanche, namely making\nswimming motions. Yet, if this swimmer had no conception whatsoever of\nan avalanche or of snow, he would not know how to escape an avalanche.\nThis suggests that there must be some propositional/representational\naspect of knowing how to \u03a6. Hence, according to this view for one\nto know how to \u03a6, (i) one must have objectual knowledge of a way\nof \u03a6-ing and (ii) one must grasp a correct and complete conception\nof this way.\n8.2 Ability Based Anti-Intellectualism\n\nAs we have seen, Ryle is often interpreted as claiming that\nknowledge-how ascriptions are nothing more than ascriptions of an\nability or a complex of dispositions to act in a skilled or\nintelligent manner (Hornsby 2011). (For a recent defense of\nknowledge-how as an ability, see Markie 2015.) Anti-intellectualism of\nthis sort has been voiced by Lewis (1990) and has been thought to\nundercut the so-called \u201cknowledge-argument\u201d in the\nphilosophy of mind (see Jackson 1986 for a classic formulation. For\nfurther discussion, see Nemirow 1990 and Alter 2001). However, Cath\n(2009) argues that similar worries about the argument survive even on\nsome prominent intellectualist views. For a survey of other\nconsequences thought to follow from the various positions in the\nknowledge-how debate, see Bengson and Moffett (2011b:\n44\u201354).\n\nHowever, few theorists nowadays identify knowledge-how with bare\nabilities. Setiya (2012) holds that to have knowledge-how is to have\nthe disposition to act guided by one\u2019s intention; Constantin\n(2018) argues that knowing how to \u03a6 is to have the disposition to\nhave the ability to \u03a6. Neo-Rylean views are also developed by\nCraig (1990), Wiggins (2012), and L\u00f6wenstein (2016). Craig\nsuggests that knowledge-how to \u03a6 amounts to the ability to teach\nothers how to \u03a6. Wiggins argues that genuine knowledge-how stems\nfrom a bundle of practical abilities that constitute the ethos of a\npractice and, while interrelated with propositional knowledge, cannot\nbe reduced to it. In turn, L\u00f6wenstein argues that knowledge-how\nto \u03a6 is the ability to \u03a6 intelligently guided by the\nunderstanding of the activity of \u03a6-ing. \n\nCarter and Pritchard (2015a,b,c) develop an alternative view which\ndoes not equate knowledge-how with an ability, but it still gives\nability a central theoretical role. In their view, knowing how to\n\u03a6 is a cognitive achievement, given our abilities to\n\u03a6: if one successfully \u03a6s because of one\u2019s ability, then\none knows how to \u03a6. And if one knows how to \u03a6, then one is\npositioned to successfully \u03a6 because of one\u2019s ability.\nTherefore, for them, knowledge-how does not reduce to the mere\npossession of abilities but it essentially involves the successful\nenactment of these abilities. Habgood-Coote (2019) defends the view\nthat knowing how to \u03a6 just is the ability to generate the right\nanswers to the question of how to \u03a6. Although on this view,\nknowledge-how is a relation an agent bears to a proposition\u2014one\nthat answers the relevant practical question\u2014this relation to a\nproposition is not understood in epistemic terms but in terms of\ndispositions (see also Audi 2017 and Farkas 2017).\n8.3 Radical Anti-Intellectualism: Practicalism\n\nWhile the intellectualist holds that knowledge-how must be understood\nin terms of knowledge-that, radical anti-intellectualism\nholds that knowledge-that must be understood in terms of knowledge-how\nor skill. As Hetherington puts it: \n\n\nYour knowing that p is your having the ability to\nmanifest various accurate representations of p. The knowledge\nas such is the ability as such. (2011: 42, original emphasis) \n\n\nAn agent knows that, for instance, she is in France whenever she is\nable to produce the corresponding true belief, to assert that she is\nindeed in France, provide justification, answer related questions,\netc. (see Hartland-Swann 1956; Roland 1958 for classic formulation and\nHetherington\u2019s 2006, 2011, 2020 \u201cpracticalism\u201d for a\nmore recent form of radical anti-intellectualism).\n9. Knowledge-How and Skill\n9.1 Skill Across Cultures\n\nThe most recent debate on knowledge-how has intertwined with a debate\non the nature of skills. While there is no consensus on what counts as\na skill, by and large people take skills to manifest in purposeful and\ngoal-directed activities and to be learnable and improvable through\npractice (Fitts & Posner 1967; Stanley & Krakauer 2013;\nWillingham 1998; Yarrow, Brown, & Krakauer 2009). Skills are\nusually contrasted with knacks (or mere talents). Some\ncontrast them with habits (Pear 1926; Ryle 1949) in that these are\nperformed automatically, whereas the exercise of intelligent\ncapacities involves self-control, attention to the conditions, and\nawareness of the task. Others, instead, argue that understanding skill\nrequires a better understanding of what habits amount to (Gallagher\n2017; Hutto & Robertson 2020).\n\nThe topic of skill and expertise is central since ancient philosophy\nthrough the notion of techn\u0113. Although both Plato and\nAristotle took techn\u0113 to be a kind of knowledge, there\nis significant controversy about their conceptions regarding the\nnature of this kind of knowledge and its relation to experience\n(empeiria) on one hand, and scientific knowledge\n(epist\u0113m\u0113) on the other (Johansen 2017; Lorenz\n& Morison 2019; Coope 2020). Annas (1995, 2001, 2011) develops an\ninterpretation on which skill and virtue (or phron\u0113sis)\nare closer in Aristotle\u2019s action theory than usually thought and\nthey are both conceived along a broadly intellectualist model. \n\nIn contemporary times, the notion of skill is central to the\nphilosophy of the twentieth-century French phenomenologist Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty. Merleau-Ponty (1945 [1962]) distinguishes between\nmotor intentionality\u2014the sort of intentionality\nrelevant for motor skills\u2014and cognitive intentionality.\nWhile the latter is conceptual and representational, Merleau-Ponty\nthought that motor intentionality is non-representational and\nnon-conceptual. Central to Merleau-Ponty is the role of motor skills\nin shaping perceptual experience: in paradigmatic cases of perception,\nthe flow of information taken in by perceivers is inseparable from the\nway they move through a scene. On this view, even superficially static\nperceptions engage motor skills, such as seeing the color of a table\nas uniform when different parts of it are differently illuminated (see\nSiegel 2020 for an helpful introduction).\n\nThis phenomenological tradition inspires Dreyfus\u2019 (1991, 2000,\n2002, 2005, 2007) critique of standard action theory. According to\nDreyfus, theories on which an action is intentional only if the agent\nis in a mental state that represents the goal of her action (cf.\nSearle 1980, 2001) or on which actions are permeated by conceptual\nrationality (cf. McDowell 2007) are not supported by the phenomenology\nof purposive activity. Paradigmatic examples of these purposive\nactivities are, for Dreyfus, skillful activities like playing tennis\nor habitual activity like rolling over in bed or making gestures while\nspeaking. In this sort of skillful coping, Dreyfus thought that the\nmind does not represent the world as detached from it. Rather, it is\nfundamentally embedded, absorbed, and embodied (see Gehrman &\nSchwenkler 2020 for an helpful introduction to Dreyfus on skills).\n\n\nThe notion of skill is central also in Eastern philosophy. Garfield\nand Priest (2020) examine the various roles that the notion of skill\nplays in the Indian school of Mahayana Buddhism, in Daoism, and in\nChan/Zen thought. In Daoism as well as in Chan/Zen Buddhism, the\nemphasis on skill is also connected, fundamentally, to concerns about\nliving a good and ethical life. Sarkissan (2020) argues that two\nprominent types of expertise often encountered in ancient Chinese\nthought from the sixth to third centuries BCE: The first is expertise\nat a particular craft, occupation, or dao, as is most\nfamously presented in the Daoist anthology Zhuangzi. The\nsecond is ethical expertise in the Ruist (Confucian) and Mohist\nschools (cf. for more on skill in Buddhism, see also MacKenzie\n2020).\n9.2 Intellectualism and Anti-Intellectualism About Skill\n\nWhat is the relation between knowledge-how and skill? For many tasks\nat least, it is intuitive that one cannot be skilled at it without\nknowing how to perform it. At first, it also seems as if knowledge-how\nentails skill: one does not really know how to swim if one does not\nhave the skill to swim; and one cannot know how to tell apart birds\nwithout the skills of a bird watcher. One might object to the\nsufficiency of knowledge-how for skill on the grounds that it is\nnatural to say things such as \u201cJohn may know how to make\nrisotto, but I would not say he is skilled at it\u201d. However,\nknowing how to make risotto sufficiently well (relative to\ncontextually determined standards) might entail being skilled at it\n(relative to the same standards) (Cath 2020).\n\nRyle (1946, 1949) used \u201cskill\u201d and\n\u201cknowledge-how\u201d interchangeably in his criticism of the\n\u201cIntellectualist legend\u201d (for discussion, see Kremer\n2020). In fact, Ryle\u2019s view of knowledge-how is stated,\nliterally, as the view that \u201cskill\u201d is a complex of\ndispositions (Ryle 1949: 33; see also Ryle 1967, 1974, 1976 for his\nviews on how skill as a form of knowledge is distinguished by the\nforms on how it is taught and learned through training). This\ndiscussion brings us to whether intellectualism about knowledge-how\nand intellectualism about skill stand or fall together.\nShould intellectualists about knowledge-how identify skill too with\npropositional knowledge? While Stanley and Williamson (2001) embrace\nthe view that knowledge-how is propositional knowledge, in a recent\npaper (Stanley & Williamson 2017), they refuse to think of\nskill as a standing propositional knowledge state. Rather,\nthey argue that skills are dispositions to know. One motivation for\nthis view is that this addresses the novelty challenge raised by\nDreyfus (1991, 2005). According to this challenge, propositional\nknowledge cannot explain the ability to respond intelligently to\nsituations that have not been encountered by the agent before. If\nskills are dispositions to know, it is no mystery how novel situations\ncan be handled by skillful agents. Stanley & Williamson (2017)\nclaim that the resulting view is still broadly intellectualist in a\nsense, because on it, skillful action manifests propositional\nknowledge (for a criticism of this response to the novelty objection,\nsee Pavese 2016 in\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nSome authors argue that while skills may be related to propositional\nknowledge, they do not reduce to it. Dickie (2012) suggests that an\nagent is skilled at \u03a6 whenever her intentions to \u03a6 are\nnon-lucky selectors of non-lucky means to \u03a6; while, in turn, these\nmeans might manifest propositional knowledge. Some argue that control\nis necessary for skills, and control cannot fully be understood in\nterms of propositional knowledge (Fridland 2014, 2017a, 2017b). In\norder to provide a theory of skill that makes room for control,\nFridland (2020) develops a \u201cfunctional\u201d account of skills.\nIn this view, a skill is a function from intentions to action,\nimplemented through certain \u201ccontrol structures\u201d, which\ninclude attention and strategic control. Among these control\nstructures, there is also propositional knowledge, which is required\nfor strategic control. In contrast, intellectualists about skills\nargue that being in control is not intelligible unless it is\nunderstood in terms of knowing what one is doing in virtue of knowing\nhow to perform that action. Therefore, they argue that agentive\ncontrol itself is best understood in terms of the capacity for\npropositional knowledge.\n9.3 Skills in Epistemology\n\nUnderstanding the nature of skill and its relation with knowledge is\nof crucial importance for virtue epistemology\u2014the view that\nknowledge is to be defined in terms of the success of our cognitive\nskills (Zagzebski 2003, 2008; Sosa 2007, 2009; J. Greco 2003, 2010;\nPritchard 2012; Turri 2013, 2016; Beddor & Pavese 2020; Pritchard\n2020). Nevertheless, if it turns out that skill must be explained in\nterms of knowledge, virtue epistemology would be trying to account for\nknowledge in terms of knowledge and so would be viciously circular\n(see Millar 2009; Stanley & Williamson 2017 for an argument in\nthis spirit). Some virtue epistemologists have responded by offering\nan anti-intellectualist account of knowledge-yielding cognitive\nskills. Sosa and Callahan (2020) describe the relevant skills as\ndispositions to succeed when one tries\u2014such that knowledge is\nobtained when agents in the right shape and in the right situation\nenact these skills appropriately.\n9.4 The Nature of Skilled Action\n\nRecent discussions on skill include a renewed debate on the nature of\nskilled action\u2014i.e., on the sort of processes that are involved\nin the manifestation of skills. The most recent discussion on skilled\naction concerns the extent to which they are automatic or under\nconscious control. A long tradition has taken skilled action to be\nparadigmatically a matter of \u201cabsorbed coping\u201d (Heidegger\n1927; Merleau-Ponty 1945 [1962]; Dreyfus 1991)\u2014characterized as\nimmersion in the situation and intuitive response to its demands, with\nlittle awareness of the body, tools or even possibly the activity\nitself. Following Dreyfus and the phenomenological tradition, some\nenactivists (e.g., No\u00eb 2004) highlight the analogies between\nskillful behavior and perception; other enactivists (e.g., Gallagher\n2017; Hutto & Robertson 2020) argue that in order to understand\nthe automaticity and unreflectiveness of skilled action, we ought to\nbetter understand habitual behavior. Even outside the phenomenological\ntradition, people have emphasized the unreflective aspect of skilled\naction. For example, Papineau (2013) argues that skilled actions are\ntypically too fast for conscious control. One important argument for\nthe unreflectiveness of skilled action starts from the phenomenon of\nchoking under pressure, where an individual performs significantly\nworse than would be expected in a high-pressure situation. This\nphenomenon has been taken to be evidence that skillful action proceeds\nwithout conscious attention, because choking episodes are thought to\narise from the fact that anxiety leads one to focus and direct\none\u2019s mind on the performance, which would proceed smoothly if\nmindless (Baumeister 1984; Masters 1992; Beilock & Carr 2001;\nFord, Hodges, & Williams 2005; Jackson, Ashford, & Norsworthy\n2006; Gucciardi & Dimmock 2008). Some argue that unreflectiveness\nalso characterizes skillful joint action (H\u00f8ffding 2014;\nGallagher and Ilund\u00e1in-Agurruza 2020).\n\nIn recent years, however, some have emphasized the role of attention\nand consciousness in skillful performance (Montero 2016, 2020; Wu\n2016, 2020). Montero argues against the Dreyfusian idea of skillful\nand mindless coping, by noting that online conscious thought about\nwhat one is doing is compatible with expertise and by surveying\nempirical evidence that suggests revisiting the choking argument.\nChristensen, Sutton and McIlwain (2016) and Christensen, Sutton, and\nBicknell\u2019s (2019) argue for the centrality of cognition in\nexplaining the flexibility of skilled action in complex situations and\nadvance a \u201cmesh theory\u201d of skilled action, according to\nwhich skilled action results for a mesh of both automatic and\ncognitively controlled processes (for a survey of some of these\nissues, Christensen 2019. See also Sutton 2007 and Fridland\n2017b).\n10. Knowledge-How and Other Related Topics\n\nKnowledge-how is related to but distinct from practical\nknowledge (Anscombe 1957). Practical knowledge is occurrent\nduring intentional action: when one intentionally acts, one knows what\none is doing while knowing it. While being capable of practical\nknowledge might require knowledge-how, knowing how to perform an\naction does not entail performing that action, and so does not entail\npractical knowledge (Setiya 2008; Schwenkler 2019; Small 2020). Some\nhave argued knowledge-how is the norm of intention (Habgood-Coote\n2018b), so that one can properly intend to perform an act only if one\nknows how to perform it. \n\nAn important question is whether knowledge-how is connected to\ndistinctive kinds of epistemic injustice (Fricker 2007; Dotson 2011;\nCollins 1990, 1998; Medina 2011). Hawley (2011) discusses the\nphenomena whereby people ascribe less knowledge-how and ability to\nfemale musicians (Goldin & Rouse 2000) and whereby standards for\njudgments of success due to ability rather than luck or\n\u201cinstinct\u201d tend to be higher for women and non-white men\n(Biernat & Kobrynowicz 1997). In these cases, agents may be\ntransmitting knowledge by being direct sources of information, rather\nthan by testifying to the truth of a proposition. If so, the harms\nthat they suffer might call for a different account than standard\ncases of epistemic injustices like Fricker\u2019s (2007), which focus\non testimonial transmission of knowledge-that.\n\nA final topic of interest is the relation between knowledge-how and\nfaith. While most views on faith focus on its doxastic aspect, Sliwa\n(2018) argues that faith essentially involves agents acting in the\nright way with respect to the object of their faith. Having faith in a\nperson, for instance, requires knowing how to interact with them so as\nto trust them, help them, and ensure their autonomy in general.\nReligious faith, similarly, requires faithful agents to know how to\nenact the relevant practices like going to mass, declaring one\u2019s\nfaith, and praying.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abbott, Barbara, 2013, \u201cLinguistic Solutions to\nPhilosophical Problems: The Case of Knowing How\u201d,\n<em>Philosophical Perspectives</em>, 27(1): 1\u201321.\ndoi:10.1111/phpe.12019", "Adams, Marcus P., 2009, \u201cEmpirical Evidence and the\nKnowledge-That/Knowledge-How Distinction\u201d, <em>Synthese</em>,\n170(1): 97\u2013114. doi:10.1007/s11229-008-9349-z", "Allen, Collin and Marc Bekoff, 1999, <em>Species of Mind: The\nPhilosophy and Biology of Cognitive Ethology</em>, Cambridge, MA: MIT\nPress. doi:10.7551/mitpress/6395.001.0001", "Alter, Torin, 2001, \u201cKnow-How, Ability, and the Ability\nHypothesis\u201d, <em>Theoria</em>, 67(3): 229\u2013239.\ndoi:10.1111/j.1755-2567.2001.tb00205.x", "Anderson, John R., 1983, <em>The Architecture of Cognition</em>,\nCambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.
