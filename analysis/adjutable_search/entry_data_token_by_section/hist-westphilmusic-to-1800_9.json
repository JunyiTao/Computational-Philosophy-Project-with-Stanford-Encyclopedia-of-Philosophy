These were divided into the arts of the\ntrivium (grammar, logic and rhetoric) and the\nquadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music). The\narts of the trivium were referred to as artes\nsermocinales, because they are related to discourse and language.\nThe arts of the quadrivium were instead the artes\nreales, studying the mathematical and physical constitution of\nthe universe. The classification of music as one of the artes\nreales is unsurprising in light of the Pythagorean-Boethian view\nof music as primarily concerned with proportions and harmony.\n\nWhile this classification remained mostly unchallenged, there were\nsome important dissenting voices (for an overview, see Dyer 2007).\nThese disputes regarding the proper classification of music are\nimportant because they reflect underlying concerns with music\u2019s\nnature and purposes. From the thirteenth century onwards, theorists\nand philosophers became more concerned with the practical and acoustic\nsides of music-making, and less with its theological implications. For\ninstance, the English grammarian John of Garland (1195\u20131272)\ndistinguishes between plainsong, mensural music, and instrumental\nmusic, and does so on the bases of historical and musicological\ndifferences between such repertoires (see Fubini 1991: 94).\n\nThe progressive assimilation of Aristotle\u2019s work in medieval\nthought meant that the physical, sounding aspects of music began to be\nconsidered as important as its mathematical ones. Evidence of this is\nThomas Aquinas\u2019s classification of music as one of the\nscientie medie, that is, disciplines that apply mathematics\nto the study of natural objects (see Dyer 2007: 67\u201368).\n",
