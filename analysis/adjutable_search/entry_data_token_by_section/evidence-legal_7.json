The concept of weight\ncan also apply to the total body of evidence presented at the trial;\nhere \u201cweight\u201d is commonly referred to as the\n\u201csufficiency of \n evidence\u201d.[14]\n The law assigns the legal\nburden of proof between parties to a dispute. For instance, at a\ncriminal trial, the accused is presumed innocent and the burden is on\nthe prosecution to prove that he is guilty as charged. To secure a\nconviction, the body of evidence presented at the trial must be\nsufficient to meet the standard of proof. Putting this generally, a\nverdict will be given in favour of the side bearing the legal burden\nof proof only if, having considered all of the evidence, the\nfact-finder is satisfied that the applicable standard of proof is met.\nThe standard of proof has been given different interpretations.\n\nOn one interpretation, the standard of proof is a probabilistic\nthreshold. In civil cases, the standard is the \u201cbalance of\nprobabilities\u201d or, as it is more popularly called in the United\nStates, the \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d. The plaintiff\nwill satisfy this standard and succeed in his claim only if there is,\non all the evidence adduced in the case, more than 0.5 probability of\nhis claim being true. At criminal trials, the standard for a guilty\nverdict is \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. Here the\nprobabilistic threshold is thought to be much higher than 0.5 but\ncourts have eschewed any attempt at authoritative quantification.\nTypically, a notional value, such as 0.9 or 0.95, is assumed by\nwriters for the sake of discussion. For the prosecution to secure a\nguilty verdict, the evidence adduced at the trial must establish the\ncriminal charge to a degree of probability that crosses this\nthreshold. Where, as in the United States, there is an intermediate\nstandard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d which is\nreserved for special cases, the probabilistic threshold is said to lie\nsomewhere between 0.5 and the threshold for proof beyond reasonable\ndoubt.\n\nKaplan was among the first to employ decision theory to develop a\nframework for setting the probabilistic threshold that represents the\nstandard of proof. Since the attention in this area of the law tends\nto be on the avoidance of errors and their undesirable consequences,\nhe finds it convenient to focus on disutility rather than utility. The\nexpected disutility of an outcome is the product of the disutility\n(broadly, the social costs) of that outcome and the probability of\nthat outcome. Only two options are generally available to the court:\nin criminal cases, it must either convict or acquit the accused and in\ncivil cases, it has to give judgment either for the plaintiff or for\nthe defendant. At a criminal trial, the decision should be made to\nconvict where the expected disutility of a decision to acquit is\ngreater than the expected disutility of a decision to convict. This is\nso as to minimize the expected disutilities. To put this in the form\nof an equation: \n\n\\[ P\\cdot\\textit{Dag} > (1-P)\\textit{Dci} \\]\n\n\nP is the probability that the accused is guilty on the basis\nof all the evidence adduced in the case, Dag is the\ndisutility of acquitting a guilty person and Dci is the\ndisutility of convicting an innocent person. A similar analysis\napplies to civil cases: the defendant should be found liable where the\nexpected disutility of finding him not liable when he is in fact\nliable exceeds the expected disutility of finding him liable when he\nis in fact not liable.\n\nOn this approach, a person should be convicted of a crime only where\nP is greater than: \n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\textit{Dag}}{\\textit{Dci}}} \\]\n\n\nThe same formula applies in civil cases except that the two\ndisutilities (Dag and Dci) will have to be replaced\nby their civil equivalents (framed in terms of the disutility of\nawarding the judgment to a plaintiff who in fact does not deserve it\nand disutility of awarding the judgment to a defendant who in fact\ndoes not deserve it). On this formula, the crucial determinant of the\nstandard of proof is the ratio of the two disutilities. In the civil\ncontext, the disutility of an error in one direction is deemed equal\nto the disutility of an error in the other direction. Hence, a\nprobability of liability of greater than 0.5 would suffice for a\ndecision to enter judgment against the defendant (see Redmayne 1996:\n171). The situation is different at a criminal trial. Dci,\nthe disutility of convicting an innocent person is considered far\ngreater than Dag, the disutility of acquitting a guilty\n person.[15]\n Hence, the probability threshold for a conviction should be much\nhigher than 0.5 (Kaplan 1968: 1071\u20131073; see also Cullison\n1969).\n\nAn objection to this analysis is that it is incomplete. It is not\nenough to compare the costs of erroneous verdicts. The utility of an\naccurate conviction and the utility of an accurate acquittal should\nalso be considered and factored into the equation (Lillquist 2002:\n 108).[16]\n This results in the following modification of the formula for setting\nthe standard of proof: \n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\textit{Ucg}-\\textit{Uag}}{\\textit{Uai}-\\textit{Uci}}} \\]\n\n\nUcg is the utility of convicting the guilty, Uag is\nthe utility of acquitting the guilty, Uai is the utility of\nacquitting the innocent and Uci the utility of convicting the\ninnocent.\n\nSince the relevant utilities depend on the individual circumstances,\nsuch as the seriousness of the crime and the severity of the\npunishment, the decision-theoretic account of the standard of proof\nwould seem, on both the simple and the modified version, to lead to\nthe conclusion that the probabilistic threshold should vary from case\nto case (Lillquist 2002; Bartels 1981; Laudan and Saunders 2009;\nRibeiro 2019). In other words, the standard of proof should be a\nflexible or floating one. This view is perceived to be\nproblematic.\n\nFirst, it falls short descriptively. The law requires the court to\napply a fixed standard of proof for all cases within the relevant\ncategory. In theory, all criminal cases are governed by the same high\nstandard and all civil cases are governed by the same lower standard.\nThat said, it is unclear whether factfinders in reality adhere\nstrictly to a fixed standard of proof (see Kaplow 2012:\n805\u2013809).\n\nThe argument is better interpreted as a normative argument\u2014as\nadvancing the claim about what the law ought to be and not what it is.\nThe standard of proof ought to vary from case to case. But this\nproposal faces a second objection. For convenience, the objection will\nbe elaborated in the criminal setting; in principle, civil litigants\nhave the same two rights that we shall identify. According to Dworkin\n(1981), moral harm arises as an objective moral fact when a person is\nerroneously convicted of a crime. Moral harm is distinguished from the\nbare harm (in the form of pain, frustration, deprivation of liberty\nand so forth) that is suffered by a wrongfully convicted and punished\nperson. While accused persons have the right not to be convicted if\ninnocent, they do not have the right to the most accurate procedure\npossible for ascertaining their guilt or innocence. However, they do\nhave the right that a certain weight or importance be attached to the\nrisk of moral harm in the design of procedural and evidential rules\nthat affect the level of accuracy. Accused persons have the further\nright to a consistent weighting of the importance of moral harm and\nthis further right stems from their right to equal concern and\nrespect. Dworkin\u2019s theory carries an implication bearing on the\npresent debate. It is arguable that to adopt a floating standard of\nproof would offend the second right insofar as it means treating\naccused persons differently with respect to the evaluation of the\nimportance of avoiding moral harm. This difference in treatment is\nreflected in the different level of the risk of moral harm to which\nthey are exposed.\n\nThere is a third objection to a floating standard of proof. Picinali\n(2013) sees fact-finding as a theoretical exercise that engages the\nquestion of what to believe about the disputed facts. What counts as\n\u201creasonable\u201d for the purposes of applying the standard of\nproof beyond reasonable doubt is accordingly a matter for theoretical\nas opposed to practical reasoning. Briefly, theoretical reasoning is\nconcerned with what to believe whereas practical reasoning is about\nwhat to do. Only reasons for belief are germane in theoretical\nreasoning. While considerations that bear on the assessment of utility\nand disutility provide reasons for action, they are not reasons for\nbelieving in the accused\u2019s guilt. Decision theory cannot\ntherefore be used to support a variable application of the standard of\nproof beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe third criticism of a flexible standard of proof does not directly\nchallenge the decision-theoretic analysis of the standard of proof. On\nthat analysis, it would seem that the maximisation of expected utility\nis the criterion for selecting the appropriate probabilistic threshold\nto apply and it plays no further role in deciding whether that\nthreshold, once selected, is met on the evidence adduced in the\nparticular case. It is not incompatible with the decision-theoretic\nanalysis to insist that the question of whether the selected threshold\nis met should be governed wholly by epistemic considerations. However,\nit is arguable that what counts as good or strong enough theoretical\nreason for judging, and hence believing, that something is true is\ndependent on the context, such as what is at stake in believing that\nit is true. More is at stake at a trial involving the death penalty\nthan in a case of petty shop-lifting; accordingly, there should be\nstronger epistemic justification for a finding of guilt in the first\nthan in the second case. Philosophical literature on epistemic\ncontextualism and on interest-relative accounts of knowledge and\njustified belief has been drawn upon to support a variant standard of\nproof (Ho 2008: ch. 4; see also Amaya 2015:\n 525\u2013531).[17]\n\nThe premise of the third criticism is that the trier of fact has to\nmake a finding on a disputed factual proposition based on his belief\nin the proposition. This is contentious. Beliefs are involuntary; we\ncannot believe something by simply deciding to believe it. The\ndominant view is that beliefs are context-independent; at any given\nmoment, we cannot believe something in one context and not believe it\nin another. On the other hand, legal fact-finding involves choice and\ndecision making and it is dependent on the context; for example,\nevidence that is strong enough to justify a finding of fact in a civil\ncase may not be strong enough to justify the same finding in a\ncriminal case where the standard of proof is higher. It has been\nargued that the fact-finder has to base his findings not on what he\nbelieves but what he accepts (Cohen 1991, 1992: 117\u2013125,\nBeltr\u00e1n 2006; cf. Picinali 2013: 868\u2013869). Belief and\nacceptance are propositional attitudes: they are different attitudes\nthat one can have in relation to a proposition. As Cohen (1992: 4)\nexplains:\n\n\nto accept that p is to have or adopt a policy of deeming,\npositing or postulating that p\u2014i.e. of including that\nproposition or rule among one\u2019s premises for deciding what to do\nor think in a particular context.\n\n3.2.2 Objections to Using Mathematical Probability to Interpret Standards of Proof\n\nUnderstanding standards of proof in terms of mathematical\nprobabilities is controversial. It is said to raise a number of\nparadoxes (Cohen 1977; Allen 1986, 1991; Allen and Leiter 2001;\nRedmayne 2008). Let us return to our previous example. The defendant,\nBlue Bus Company, owns 75% of the buses in the town where the\nplaintiff was injured by a recklessly driven bus and the remaining 25%\nis owned by Red Bus Company. No other evidence is presented. Leaving\naside the reference class problem discussed above, there is a 0.75\nprobability that the accident was caused by a bus owned by the\ndefendant. On the probabilistic interpretation of the applicable\nstandard of proof (that is, the balance of probabilities), the\nevidence should be sufficient to justify a verdict in the\nplaintiff\u2019s favour. But most lawyers would agree that the\nevidence is insufficient. Another familiar hypothetical scenario is\nset in the criminal context (Nesson 1979: 1192\u20131193). Twenty\nfive prisoners are exercising in a prison yard. Twenty four of them\nsuddenly set upon a guard and kill him. The remaining prisoner refuses\nto participate. We cannot in the ensuing confusion identify the\nprisoner who refrained from the attack. Subsequently, one prisoner is\nselected randomly and prosecuted for the murder of the guard. Those\nare the only facts presented at the trial. The applicable standard is\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. Assume that the probabilistic\nthreshold of this standard is 0.95. On the statistical evidence, there\nis a probability of 0.96 that the defendant is criminally\n liable.[18]\n Despite the statistical probability of liability exceeding the\nthreshold, it is widely agreed that the defendant must be acquitted.\nIn both of the examples just described, why is the evidence\ninsufficient and what does this say about legal standards of\nproof?\n\nVarious attempts have been made to find the answers (for surveys of\nthese attempts, see Enoch and Fisher 2015: 565\u2013571; Redmayne\n2008, Ho 2008: 135\u2013143, 168\u2013170; Gardiner 2019b; section 6\nof the entry on \n legal probabilism). \n It has been argued that meeting a\nlegal standard of proof is not merely or fundamentally a matter of\nadducing evidence to establish a mathematical probability of liability\nbeyond a certain level. Standards of proof should be interpreted in\nepistemic rather than probabilistic terms. According to one\ninterpretation, the evidence is sufficient to satisfy a standard of\nproof only if it is capable of justifying full or outright belief in\nthe material facts that constitute legal liability and bare\nstatistical evidence, as in our examples, cannot justify such a\nbelief. (Nelkin 2021; Smith 2018; Buchak 2014; Ho 2008: 89\u201399.)\nOn Smith\u2019s account, the statistical evidence in our two examples\nfails to justify belief in the proposition that the defendant is\nliable because the evidence does not normically support that\nproposition. Evidence normically supports a proposition just in case\nthe situation in which the evidence is true and the proposition is\nfalse is less normal, in the sense of requiring more explanation, than\nthe situation in which the evidence and the proposition are both true.\nWhere all that we have is statistical evidence, it could just so\nhappen that the material proposition is false (it could just so happen\nthat the accident-causing bus was red or that the accused was the one\nwho refused to join in the murder), so no further explanation is\nneeded where the proposition is false than where it is true (Smith\n2018).\n\nOn a different epistemic interpretation, the evidence is sufficient to\nmeet a legal standard of proof, and a finding of legal liability is\npermissible, only if the factfinder can gain knowledge of the\ndefendant\u2019s liability\u2014to be precise, of the material facts\nestablishing such liability\u2014from the evidence (Duff et al. 2007:\n87\u201391; Pardo 2010; for a critical overview of knowledge-centered\naccounts, see Gardiner forthcoming). High probability of liability\nalone will not suffice. On more subtle knowledge-centered theories,\nthe standards of proof are met only if, on the available evidence,\nthere is a sufficiently high probability that the fact finder knows\nthat the defendant is liable (Littlejohn 2020 and 2021; Blome-Tillmann\n2017), or only if the fact finder\u2019s credence in the\ndefendant\u2019s liability exceeds the relevant legal threshold and\nthe credence constitutes knowledge (Moss 2018). It is further claimed\nthat the relevant knowledge necessary for a finding of liability\ncannot be obtained from statistical evidence alone (Littlejohn 2020\nand 2021; Blome-Tillmann 2017; Moss 2018 and forthcoming). According\nto Thomson, this is because the statistical evidence (to take our\nfirst example, the 75% ownership of blue buses) is not causally\nconnected with the fact sought to be proved and cannot guarantee the\ntruth of the relevant belief (that the bus which caused the accident\nwas blue) (Thomson 1986). An alternative argument is that knowledge\nrequires the ruling out of all relevant alternatives and, to take our\nprison scenario, there is no evidence that addresses the possibility\nthat the defendant was the one who refrained from joining in the\nattack or the possibility that the defendant is less likely to be\nguilty than an arbitrary prisoner in the yard. (See Moss forthcoming;\nMoss 2018: 213. Gardiner 2019a adapts the relevant alternatives\nframework to model legal standards of proof in a non-mathematical way\nwhile eschewing a knowledge account of those standards.) Another\npossible explanation for the failure to know relies on the notion of\nsensitivity. The belief that the defendant is liable is not sensitive\nto the truth where it is based on bare statistical evidence; in the\nbus example, evidence of the market share of buses remain the same\nwhether it is true or not that a blue bus caused the accident (cf.\nEnoch, Spectre, and Fisher 2012; Enoch and Fisher 2015; Enoch and\nSpectre 2019 \u2013 while suggesting that the lack of knowledge has\ngenerally to do with the insensitivity of the belief, the authors deny\nthat knowledge should matter to the imposition of legal liability).\nYet another explanation is that it is unsafe to find a person liable\non bare statistical evidence. Though safety is sometimes treated as a\ncondition of knowledge (in that knowledge requires a true belief that\nis safe), one can treat safety as a condition for finding the\ndefendant liable without also taking the position that the finding\nmust be based on knowledge of liability. Safety is commonly understood\nin terms of whether a belief formed on the same basis would be true in\nclose possible worlds. Roughly, a finding of liability is unsafe where\nit can easily be wrong in the sense that little in the actual world\nneeds to change for it to be wrong. Whether the requirement of safety\ncan explain why judgment should not entered against the defendant in\nour two hypothetical cases would depend on whether it can easily\nhappen that the accident-causing bus was red or that the accused is\ninnocent. (See Pritchard 2015 and 2018; Pardo 2018; cf. Gardiner\n2020.) While theorizing of standards of proof in epistemic terms has\ngathered pace in recent years, it is criticised for relying on\nunrealistic hypotheticals that fail to attend to the actual operation\nof legal systems and for making impossible epistemological demands\n(Allen 2020).\n\nThere is another paradox in the mathematical interpretation of the\nstandard of proof. This is the \u201cconjunction paradox\u201d. To\nsucceed in a civil claim (or a criminal prosecution), the plaintiff\n(or the prosecution) will have to prove the material facts\u2014or\n\u201celements\u201d\u2014that constitute the civil claim (or\ncriminal charge) that is before the court (see discussion of\n\u201cmateriality\u201d in\n section 2.2\n above). Imagine a claim under the law of negligence that rests on two\nelements: a breach of duty of care by the defendant (element\nA) and causation of harm to the plaintiff (element\nB). To win the case, the plaintiff is legally required to\nprove A and B. For the sake of simplicity, let\nA and B be mutually independent events. Suppose the\nevidence establishes A to a probability of 0.6 and B\nto a probability of 0.7. On the mathematical interpretation of the\ncivil standard of proof, the plaintiff should succeed in his claim\nsince the probability with respect to each of the elements exceeds\n0.5. However, according to the multiplication rule of conventional\nprobability calculus, the probability that A and B\nare both true is the product of their respective probabilities; in\nthis example, it is only 0.42 (obtained by multiplying 0.6 with 0.7).\nThus, the overall probability is greater that the defendant deserves\nto win than that the plaintiff deserves to win, and yet the verdict is\nawarded in favour of the plaintiff.\n\nOne way of avoiding the conjunction paradox is to take the position\nthat it should not be enough for each element to cross the\nprobabilistic threshold; the plaintiff (or the prosecution) should win\nonly if the probability of the plaintiff\u2019s (or\nprosecution\u2019s) case as a whole exceeds the applicable\nprobabilistic threshold. So, in our example, the plaintiff should lose\nsince the overall probability is below 0.5. But this suggested\nsolution is unsatisfactory. The required level of overall probability\nwould then turn on how many elements the civil claim or criminal\ncharge happens to have. The greater the number of elements, the higher\nthe level of probability to which, on average, each of them must be\nproved. This is thought to be arbitrary and hence objectionable. As\ntwo commentators noted, the legal definition of theft contains more\nelements than that for murder. Criminal law is not the same in all\ncountries. We may take the following as a convenient approximation of\nwhat the law is in some countries: murder is (1) an act that caused\nthe death of a person (2) that was done with the intention of causing\nthe death, and to constitute theft, there must be (1) an intention to\ntake property, (2) dishonesty in taking the property, (3) removal of\nthe property from the possession of another person, and (4) lack of\nconsent by that person. Since the offence of theft contains twice the\nnumber of elements as compared to murder, the individual elements for\ntheft would have to be proved to a much higher level of probability\n(in order for the probability of their conjunction to cross the\noverall threshold) than the individual elements for the much more\nserious crime of murder (Allen and Leiter 2001: 1504\u20135). This is\nintuitively unacceptable.\n\nAnother proposal for resolving the conjunction paradox is move away\nfrom thinking of the standard of proof as a quantified threshold of\nabsolute probability and to construe it, instead, as a probability\nratio. The fact-finder has to compare the probability of the evidence\nadduced at the trial under the plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case\nwith the probability of the evidence under the defendant\u2019s\ntheory of the case (the two need not add to 1), and award the verdict\nto the side with a higher probability (Cheng 2013). One criticism of\nthis interpretation of the standard of proof is that it ignores, and\ndoes not provide a basis for ignoring, the margin by which one\nprobability exceeds the other, and the difference in probability may\nvary significantly for different elements of the case (Allen and Stein\n2013: 598).\n\nThere is a deeper problem with the probabilistic conception of the\nstandard of proof. There does not seem to be a satisfactory\ninterpretation of probability that suits the forensic context. The\nonly plausible candidate is the subjective meaning of probability\naccording to which probability is construed as the strength of belief.\nThe evidence is sufficient to satisfy the legal standard of proof on a\ndisputed question of fact\u2014for example, it is sufficient to\njustify the positive finding of fact that the accused killed the\nvictim\u2014only if the fact-finder, having considered the evidence,\nforms a sufficiently strong belief that the accused killed the victim.\nGuidance on how to process evidence and form beliefs can be found in a\nmathematical theorem known as Bayes\u2019 theorem; it is the method\nby which an ideal rational fact-finder would revise or update his\nbeliefs in the light of new\n evidence.[19]\n To return to our earlier hypothetical scenario, suppose the\nfact-finder initially believes the odds of the accused being guilty is\n1:1 (\u201cprior odds\u201d) or, putting this differently, that\nthere is a 0.5 probability of guilt. The fact-finder then receives\nevidence that blood of type A was found at the scene of the crime and\nthat the accused has type A blood. Fifty percent of the population has\nthis blood type. On the Bayesian approach, the posterior odds are\ncalculated by multiplying the prior odds (1:1) by the likelihood ratio\n(which, as we saw in\n section 2.1.2\n above, is 2:1). The fact-finder\u2019s belief in the odds of guilt\nshould now be revised to 2:1; the probability of guilt is now\nincreased to 0.67 (Lempert 1977).\n\nThe subjectivist Bayesian theory of legal fact-finding has come under\nattack (see generally Amaya 2015: 82\u201393; Pardo 2013: 591).\nFirst, as we already saw in\n section 3.1,\n ascertainment of the likelihood ratios is highly problematic.\nSecondly, the Bayesian theory is not sensitive to the weight of\nevidence which, roughly put, is the amount of evidence that is\navailable. This criticism and the concept of weight are further\nexplored in\n section 3.3.\n\nThirdly, while the Bayesian theorem offers a method for updating\nprobabilities in the light of new evidence, it is silent on what the\ninitial probability should be. In a trial setting, the initial\nprobability cannot be set at zero since this means certainty in the\ninnocence of the accused. No new evidence can then make any\ndifference; whatever the likelihood ratio of the evidence, multiplying\nit by zero (the prior probability) will still end up with a posterior\nprobability of zero. On the other hand, starting with an initial\nprobability is also problematic. This is especially so in a criminal\ncase. To start a trial with some probability of guilt is to have the\nfact-finder harbouring some initial belief that the accused is guilty\nand this is not easy to reconcile with the presumption of innocence.\n(Tribe 1971: 1368\u20131372; cf. Posner 1999: 1514, suggesting\nstarting the trial with prior odds of 50:50, criticized by Friedman\n2000. The problem of fixing the prior probability is said to disappear\nif we base fact-finding simply on likelihood ratios: Sullivan, 2019:\n45\u201359.)\n\nFourthly, we have thus far relied for ease of illustration on highly\nsimplified\u2014and therefore unrealistic\u2014examples. In real\ncases, there are normally multiple and dependent items of evidence and\nthe probabilities of all possible conjunctions of these items, which\nare numerous, will have to be computed. These computations are far too\ncomplex to be undertaken by human beings (Callen 1982: 10\u201315).\nThe impossibility of complying with the Bayesian model undermines its\nprescriptive value.\n\nFifthly, according to Haack, the Bayesian theory has it the wrong way\nround. What matters is not the strength of the fact-finder\u2019s\nbelief itself. The standard of proof should be understood instead in\nterms of what it is reasonable for the fact-finder to believe in the\nlight of the evidence presented, and this is a matter of the degree to\nwhich the belief is warranted by the evidence. Evidence is legally\nsufficient where it warrants the contested factual claim to the degree\nrequired by law. Whether a factual claim is warranted by the evidence\nturns on how strongly the evidence supports the claim, on how\nindependently secure the evidence is, and on how much of the relevant\nevidence is available to the fact-finder (that is, the\ncomprehensiveness of the evidence\u2014see further discussion in\n section 3.3\n below). Haack is against identifying degrees of warrant with\nmathematical probabilities. Degrees of warrant do not conform to the\naxioms of the standard probability calculus. For instance, where the\nevidence is weak, neither p nor not-p may be\nwarranted; in contrast, the probability of p and the\nprobability of not-p must add up to 1. Further, where the\nprobability of p and the probability of q are both\nless than 1, the probability of p and q, being the\nproduct of the probability of p and the probability of\nq, is less than the probability of either. On the other hand,\nthe degree of warrant for the conjunction of p and q\nmay be higher than the warrant for\n either.[20]\n (See Haack 2004, 2008a,b, 2012, 2014 for the legal application of her\ngeneral theory of epistemology. For her general theory of\nepistemology, see Haack 1993: ch. 4; Haack 2009: ch. 4; Haack 2003:\nch. 3.)\n\nSixthly, research in experimental psychology suggests that\nfact-finders do not evaluate pieces of evidence one-by-one and in the\nunidirectional manner required under the mathematical model (Amaya\n2015: 114\u20135). A holistic approach is taken instead where the\ndiscrete items of evidence are integrated into large cognitive\nstructures (variously labelled as \u201cmental models\u201d,\n\u201cstories\u201d, \u201cnarratives\u201d and \u201ctheories of\nthe case\u201d), and they are assessed globally against the legal\ndefinition of the crime or civil claim that is in dispute (Pennington\nand Hastie 1991, 1993; Pardo 2000). The reasoning does not progress\nlinearly from evidence to a conclusion; it is bi-directional, going\nforward and backward: as the fact-finder\u2019s consideration of the\nevidence inclines him towards a particular verdict, his leaning\ntowards that conclusion will often produce a revision of his original\nperception and his assessment of the evidence (Simon 2004, 2011).\n\nThe holistic nature of evidential reasoning as revealed by these\nstudies has inspired alternative theories that are of a\nnon-mathematical nature. One alternative, already mentioned, is the\n\u201cexplanatory\u201d or \u201crelative plausibility\u201d\ntheory advanced by Allen together with Pardo and other collaborators\n(Allen 1986, 1991, 1994; Pardo 2000; Allen and Leiter 2001; Allen and\nJehl 2003; Pardo and Allen 2008; Allen and Pardo 2019; cf. Nance 2001,\nFriedman\n 2001).[21]\n They contend that fact-finders do not reason in the fashion portrayed\nby the Bayesian model. Instead, they engage in generating explanations\nor hypotheses on the available evidence by a process of abductive\nreasoning or drawing \u201cinferences to the best explanation\u201d,\nand these competing explanations or hypotheses are compared in the\nlight of the\n evidence.[22]\n The comparison is not of a hypothesis with the negation of that\nhypothesis, where the probability of a hypothesis is compared with the\nprobability of its negation. Instead, the comparison is of one\nhypothesis with one or more particular alternative hypotheses as\nadvocated by a party or as constructed by the fact-finder himself. On\nthis approach, the plausibility of X, the factual account of the case\nthat establishes the accused\u2019s guilt or defendant\u2019s\nliability, is compared with the plausibility of a hypothesis Y, a\nspecific alternative account that points to the accused\u2019s\ninnocence or the defendant\u2019s non-liability, and there may be\nmore than one such specific alternative account.\n\nOn this theory, the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the\npreponderance of proof standard when the best-available hypothesis\nthat explains the evidence and the underlying events include all of\nthe elements of the claim. Thus, in a negligence case, the\nbest-available hypothesis would have to include a breach of duty of\ncare by the plaintiff and causation of harm to the defendant as these\nare the elements that must be proved to succeed in the legal claim.\nFor the intermediate \u201cclear-and-convincing\u201d standard of\nproof, the best-available explanation must be substantially better\nthan the alternatives. To establish the standard of proof beyond\nreasonable doubt, there must be a plausible explanation of the\nevidence that includes all of the elements of the crime and, in\naddition, there must be no plausible explanation that is consistent\nwith innocence (Pardo and Allen 2008: 238\u2013240; Pardo 2013:\n603\u2013604).\n\nThe relative plausibility theory itself is perceived to have a number\nof\n shortcomings.[23]\n First, the theory portrays the assessment of plausibility as an\nexercise of judgment that involves employment of various criteria such\nas coherence, consistency, simplicity, consilience, and more. However,\nthe theory is sketchy on the meaning of plausibility and the criteria\nfor evaluating plausibility are left largely\n unanalyzed.[24]\n\nA second criticism of the relative plausibility theory is that,\ndespite the purported utilisation of \u201cinference to the best\nexplanation\u201d reasoning, the verdict is not controlled by the\nbest explanation. For instance, even if the prosecution\u2019s\nhypothesis is better than the defence\u2019s hypothesis, neither may\nbe very good. In these circumstances, the court must reject the\nprosecution\u2019s hypothesis even though it is the best of\nalternatives (Laudan 2007). One suggested mitigation of this criticism\nis to place some demand on the epistemic effort that the trier of fact\nmust take (for example, by being sufficiently diligent and thorough)\nin constructing the set of hypotheses from which the best is to be\nchosen (Amaya 2009: 155).\n\nThe third criticism is targeted at holistic theories of evidential\nreasoning in general and not specifically at the relative plausibility\ntheory. While it may be descriptively true that fact-finders decide\nverdicts by holistic evaluation of the plausibility of competing\nexplanations, hypotheses, narratives or factual theories that are\ngenerated from the evidence, such forms of reasoning may conceal bias\nand prejudice that stand greater chances of exposure under a\nsystematic approach such as Bayesian analysis (Twining 2006: 319;\nSimon 2004, 2011; Griffin 2013). A hypothesis constructed by the\nfact-finder may be shaped subconsciously by a prejudicial\ngeneralisation or background belief about the accused based on a\ncertain feature, say, his race or sexual history. Individuating this\nfeature and subjecting it to Bayesian scrutiny has the desirable\neffect of putting the generalisation or background belief under the\nspotlight and forcing the fact-finder to confront the problem of\nprejudice.\n3.3 The Weight of Evidence as the Degree of Evidential Completeness\n\nA third idea of evidential weight is prompted by this insight from\nKeynes (1921: 71):\n\n\nAs the relevant evidence at our disposal increases, the magnitude of\nthe probability of the argument may either decrease or increase,\naccording as the new knowledge strengthens the unfavourable or the\nfavourable evidence; but something seems to have increased in\neither case,\u2014we have a more substantial basis upon which to rest\nour conclusion. I express this by saying that an accession of new\nevidence increases the weight of an argument. New evidence\nwill sometimes decrease the probability of an argument, but it will\nalways increase its \u201cweight\u201d.\n\n\nThis idea of evidential weight has been applied by some legal scholars\nin assessing the sufficiency of evidence in satisfying legal standards\nof\n proof.[25]\n At its simplest, we may think of weight in the context of legal\nfact-finding as the amount of evidence before the court. Weight is\ndistinguishable from probability. The weight of evidence may be high\nand the mathematical probability low, as in the situation where the\nprosecution adduces a great deal of evidence tending to incriminate\nthe accused but the defence has an unshakeable alibi (Cohen 1986:\n641). Conversely, the state of evidence adduced in a case might\nestablish a sufficient degree of probability\u2014high enough to\ncross the supposed threshold of proof on the mathematical conception\nof the standard of proof\u2014and yet lack adequate weight. In the\nmuch-discussed gate-crasher\u2019s paradox, the only available\nevidence shows that the defendant was one of a thousand spectators at\na rodeo show and that only four hundred and ninety nine tickets were\nissued. The defendant is sued by the show organiser for gate-crashing.\nThe mathematical probability that the defendant was a gate-crasher is\n0.501 and this meets the probabilistic threshold for civil liability.\nBut, according to the negation principle of mathematical probability,\nthere is probability of 0.499 that the defendant did pay for his\nentrance. In these circumstances, it is intuitively unjust to find him\nliable (Cohen 1977: 75). A possible explanation for not finding him\nliable is that the evidence is too flimsy or of insufficient\nweight.\n\nProponents of the mathematical conception of the standard of proof\nhave stood their ground even while acknowledging that weight has a\nrole to play in the Bayesian analysis of probative value and the\nsufficiency of evidence. If a party does not produce relevant evidence\nthat is in his possession, resulting in the court facing an evidential\ndeficiency, it may draw an adverse inference against him when\ncomputing the posterior probability (Kaye 1986b: 667; Friedman 1997).\nOne criticism of this approach is that, in the absence of information\nabout the missing evidence, the drawing of the adverse inference is\nopen to the objection of arbitrariness (Nance 2008: 274). A further\nobjection is that the management of parties\u2019 conduct relating to\nevidence preservation and presentation should be left to judges and\nnot to the jury. What a judge may do to optimize evidential weight is\nto impose a burden of producing evidence on a party and to make the\nparty suffer an adverse finding of fact if he fails to produce the\nevidence. This will serve as an incentive for the party to act in a\nmanner that promotes the interest in evidential completeness (Nance\n2008, 2010, 2016).\n\nCohen suggests that the standard of proof should be conceived entirely\nas a matter of evidential weight which, on his theory, is a matter of\nthe number of tests or challenges to which a factual hypothesis is\nsubjected to in court. He offers an account of legal fact-finding in\nterms of an account of inductive probability that was inspired by the\nwork of writers such as Francis Bacon and J.S. Mill. Inductive\nprobability operates differently from the classical calculus of\nprobability. It is based on inductive support for the common-sense\ngeneralisation that licences the drawing of the relevant inference.\nInductive support for a generalisation is graded according to the\nnumber of tests that it has passed, or, putting this in another way,\nby the degree of its resistance to falsification by relevant\nvariables. The inductive probability of an argument is equal to the\nreliability grade of the inductive support for the generalisation\nwhich covers the argument.\n\nProof beyond reasonable doubt represents the maximum level of\ninductive probability. The prosecution may try to persuade the court\nto infer that the accused was guilty of burglary by producing evidence\nto establish that he was found in the vicinity of the victim\u2019s\nhouse late at night with the stolen object on him. This inference is\nlicensed by the generalisation that normally if a stranger is found\nimmediately after a burglary in possession of the stolen object, he\nintentionally removed it himself. The defence may try to defeat the\ninference by showing that the generalization does not apply in the\nparticular case, for example, by presenting evidence to show that the\naccused had found the object on the street. The prosecution\u2019s\nhypothesis is now challenged or put to the test. As a counter-move, it\nmay produce evidence to establish that the object could not have been\nlying in the street as alleged. If the generalisations on which the\nprosecution\u2019s case rest survive challenges by the defence at\nevery possible point, then guilt is proved beyond reasonable\n doubt.[26]\n The same reasoning structure applies in the civil context except that\nin a civil case, the plaintiff succeeds in proof on the preponderance\nof evidence so long as the conclusion to be proved by him is more\ninductively probable than its negation. (Cohen 1977, 1986; cf. Schum\n 1979.)[27]\n\nCohen\u2019s theory seems to require that each test to which a\nhypothesis is put can be unequivocally and objectively resolved. But\nusually this is not the case. In our example, we may not be entirely\nconvinced that the accused found or did not find the object on the\nstreet, and our evaluation would involve the exercise of judgment that\nis no less subjective as the sort of judgments required when applying\nthe standard probabilistic conception of proof (Nance 2008:\n275\u20136; Schum 1994: 261).",
