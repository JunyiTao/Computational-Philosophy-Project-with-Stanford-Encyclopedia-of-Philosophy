As a logician, he focussed on\nfoundations, developing a theoretical framework that is still very\nmuch worth studying today, so much so that a highly respected\ncontemporary logician could (only half facetiously) write a quite\npositive review of Bolzano\u2019s Theory of Science (1837)\nas if it had just appeared (van Benthem, 2013). This is not to say\nthat all aspects of Bolzano\u2019s logical work could be mistaken for\ncontemporary productions: if he seems at times to be at home in the\ntwenty-first century, it is equally clear at others that we have to do\nwith a thinker who was born in the eighteenth.\n\nBolzano\u2019s presentation of logic in the modern sense is embedded\nin the vast Theory of Science (henceforth TS; a\nshorter introduction to Bolzano\u2019s logic may be found in Bolzano\n2004a). The best known innovations of this work belong to his\nvariation logic: definitions of universal validity and analyticity,\nalong with the creation of a complete system of extensional relations\nbetween propositions, the most important being compatibility,\ndeducibility (consequence), and equivalence. Bolzano discovered the\nlink between deducibility and conditional probability, according to\nwhich deducibility and incompatibility appear as two limit cases of\nconditional probability. He is also recognized for adopting an\nanti-psychologistic approach to logic, and for his contributions to\nsemantics. Bolzano\u2019s theory of the grounding relation\n(Abfolge) leading to a hierarchical order among the\npropositions of a deductive science is the first modern study of\naxiomatic systems. Moreover, the thorough discussions of concepts of\nlogic and many other insights contribute to make the TS one\nof the classical works in logic and epistemology, on a par with those\nof Aristotle, Leibniz, and Frege. The extensive historical notes\ncontained in it are a unique source for the history of logic. Although\nwritten in natural language, Bolzano\u2019s logic represents a\ndecisive breakthrough in the development of modern logic.\n", "toc": [{"#EarlWorkLogiMeth": "1.

Early work in logic and methodology\n\nIn 1810, Bolzano published a booklet entitled Contributions to a\nbetter founded presentation of mathematics (Bolzano 1810; Bolzano\n2004b) in which he developed his views about the unsatisfactory state\nof the mathematics of his time and the need for its reform. He\nproposed a new definition of mathematics as \u201cthe science which\ndeals with the general laws (forms) to which things must conform in\ntheir existence\u201d (Bolzano 1810, I, \u00a78; Bolzano 2004b: 94),\na new division of mathematics into universal mathematics (arithmetic,\nalgebra, analysis, and elements of his future theory of collections)\nand more specialized mathematical disciplines (e.g., the mathematical\ntheory of time, geometry, rational mechanics), and also put forth some\nconsiderations on logic. As with Leibniz, logic is again seen as\nclosely connected with mathematics: it is, indeed, the mathematical\nmethod (Bolzano 1810, II, \u00a71; Bolzano 2004b: 103).\n\nThe logical theory of the Contributions is quite primitive,\nbut the work nonetheless contains a number of important insights.\nFollowing Aristotle, Bolzano distinguished two sorts of proofs: those\nthat aim merely to convince us that something is the case and\nthose which also show why it is so. He called the former\n\u201ccertifications\u201d (Bolzano 2004b: 254:\n\u201cconfirmations\u201d) [Gewissmachungen], the latter\n\u201cgroundings\u201d [Begr\u00fcndungen]. The concept of\ngrounding reflects the \u201cobjective connection among\ntruths\u201d, which need not and usually does not coincide with the\nsubjective order of recognition. It would later become the fundamental\nconcept in Bolzano\u2019s treatment of axiomatic theories in the\nTS.\n\nHe then extended this distinction to cover other elements of axiomatic\ntheories. Subjectively, definitions are considerations that acquaint\nus with the meanings of certain words, while objectively, a definition\nindicates the parts and structure of a complex concept. Subjectively,\nsome words do not require definition, because their meanings are\nalready clearly understood, while objectively, some concepts cannot be\ndefined because they are simple, i.e., have no parts. Similarly, an\naxiom or principle in the subjective sense is a proposition whose\ntruth is evident to us, while in the objective sense an axiom is\nsimply an indemonstrable truth from which other truths may be\ndeduced.\n\nConsidered objectively, a mathematical theory itself becomes a\nmathematical object. It has an intrinsic structure, in which complex\nconcepts are ultimately composed of simple ones, and propositions are\nordered according to their relations of objective dependence,\nbeginning with the axioms. The goal of foundational research, as he\nthen saw things, is to discover and display this objective order\n(Bolzano 1810, II, \u00a7 2).\n\nThe Contributions also contains valuable epistemological\nreflections. Since axioms in the objective sense need not be evident\nto us, Bolzano states, it can and does happen that, at first anyway,\nwe find them less trustworthy than the theorems that are objectively\ndemonstrable from them. We become convinced of their truth not by\ncontemplating them in isolation, but rather by recognizing their role\nwithin a deductive system: that is, by seeing that their objective\nconsequences include the theorems we believe to be true but no\npropositions we take to be false (Bolzano 1810, II, \u00a721, note;\nBolzano 2004b: 119). Similarly, even though simple concepts cannot be\ndefined in an objective sense, they may still require definition in\nthe subjective sense, that is, we may need to develop a clear\nunderstanding of them. In such cases, our understanding\n\n\n\u2026 is brought about by mentioning several sentences, in which the\nconcept in question, designated by its own word, appears in various\ncombinations. From the comparison of these sentences, the reader is\nable to abstract which determinate concept the word designates.\n[\u2026] This means is well known as that by which each of us\nlearned the first meanings of words in our mother tongue (Bolzano\n1810, II, \u00a78; Bolzano 2004b: 107; our translation).\n\n\nBolzano called such circumlocutions \u201cparaphrases\u201d or\n\u201ccircumscriptions\u201d [Umschreibungen]. His method\npoints towards a solution of the paradox of definition according to\nwhich all concepts are ultimately defined in terms of simple concepts,\nbut these remain undefined and thus devoid of meaning.\n\nBolzano also presents two important criteria for the correctness of\nproofs: according to the first, \u201cIf the subject (or the\nhypothesis) of a proposition is as wide as it can be so that the\npredicate (or the thesis) can be applied to it, then in any correct\nproof of this proposition all characteristics of the subject must be\nused, i.e., they must be applied in the derivation of the\npredicate.\u201d The second is Bolzano\u2019s version of\nAristotle\u2019s ban on crossing from one genus to another: one\ncannot deduce a general proposition from one of its special cases\n(Bolzano 1810, II, \u00a728, 29; Bolzano 2004b: 122\u2013126). In a\nproof of the intermediate value theorem, for instance, one of the\nnecessary conditions is that the functions be real-valued. An\nattempted proof that makes no use of any attribute separating the\nreals from the rationals can accordingly be diagnosed as incorrect\naccording to the first criterion, while an attempted proof that\nappeals to geometry or kinematics will run afoul of the second. These\ninsights immediately bore fruit in Bolzano\u2019s mathematical work\n(1816, 1817).\n2. Logic as Theory of Science\n\nBolzano did not long remain satisfied with the logic sketched in the\nContributions Already in 1812, he recorded his intention to\ndevelop a new logic which would lead to a \u201ctotal transformation\nof the a priori sciences\u201d. The Theory of\nScience, written between 1820 and 1830 and published in 1837,\nmarks its realization, embedded in the broader context of general\nepistemology and methodology of science (which Bolzano also counted as\nlogic in a broader sense).\n\nBolzano defined the theory of science by its ultimate goal, which is\nthe division of human knowledge into disciplines and the composition\nof scientific treatises. According to the definition, the theory of\nscience is\n\n\nthe collection of all rules which we must follow, if we want to do a\ncompetent piece of work, when we divide the total domain of truths\ninto individual sciences, and present them in their respective\ntreatises. (TS, I, \u00a71, 7)\n\n\nThis definition presupposes a whole sequence of disciplines involved\nin the construction of a science, each of which is founded on the\npreceding one. The ultimate discipline in this sequence deals with the\ndelimitation of sciences and the principles of style of scientific\nwriting that should lead to the composition of a collection of\nscientific treatises forming an encyclopedia. Bolzano hoped that,\nfollowing the Great Encyclopedia of Diderot and D\u2019Alembert, the\nideal of the Enlightenment, the effort to spread scientifically\norganized useful knowledge would again find its finest expression in\nthe completion of an encyclopedia. In this way, the TS would\ncontribute to the general well-being.\n\nIn order to divide truths into different disciplines and present them\nin particular treatises, we first have to discover them. Such is the\ngoal of The Art of Discovery or Heuristic, which\ncontains rules for finding new truths. Heuristic presupposes the\npossibility of recognizing truths, which is the object of The\nTheory of Knowledge. Now, the decisive step in the exploration of\nthe layers of science leads to the most important part of the\nTS, The Theory of Elements, which analyses the\nobjective conditions of the subjective activity of knowing, namely the\ntheory of ideas, propositions and deduction, considered in and of\nthemselves, in short: formal logic. The Theory of\nFundamentals attempts to show that these elements are\npropositions in themselves and ideas in themselves, that there are\ninfinitely many truths in themselves and that we can know at least\nsome of them. Taking all the disciplines of the TS in the due\norder, we obtain the following structure:\n\nTheory of Fundamentals (Vol. I, \u00a7\u00a717\u201345),\nTheory of Elements, i.e., formal logic (Vol. I and Vol. II,\n\u00a7\u00a746\u2013268),\nTheory of Knowledge (Vol. III, \u00a7\u00a7269\u2013321),\nHeuristic (Vol. III, \u00a7\u00a7322\u2013391),\nTheory of Science Proper, i.e., the theory of the division of the\ntruths into particular sciences and the principles of composition for\nscientific treatises (Vol. IV, \u00a7\u00a7392\u2013718).\n\n3. Propositions in themselves\n\nBolzano\u2019s first important innovation in the TS aims at\nthe transformation of the domain of logic (more specifically, of the\nTheory of Elements). According to him, logic is not a theory of ideas\nand judgments in our mind, it is not an art de pens\u00e9e\nin the sense of Arnauld\u2019s and Nicole\u2019s Port-Royal\nLogic or an exposition of the laws of thought. Rather, logic is\nconcerned with the objective relations between propositions and ideas\nin themselves, that is, independently of their being thought\nor expressed.\n\nAlthough Bolzano took propositions to be composed of parts, which he\ncalled ideas, he does not offer a definition of the concept\nof a proposition as a certain kind of structured whole. The reason for\nthis was that no definition he had found in the writings of others,\nnor any that he could think of himself, was satisfactory. Instead, he\nseeks to convey what he means by \u2018proposition\u2019 using the\nprocedure he had earlier called \u2018circumscription\u2019 (cf.\nTS, \u00a7668, no. 9), presenting the reader with a number of\nsentences containing the word that are supposed to be true when it is\nrightly understood.\n\n\nOne will gather what I mean by proposition as soon as I\nremark that I do not call a proposition in itself or an\nobjective proposition that which the grammarians call a\nproposition, namely, the linguistic expression, but rather simply the\nmeaning of this expression, which must be exactly one of the two, true\nor false; and that accordingly I attribute actuality to the grasping\nof a proposition, to thought propositions as well as to the\njudgments made in the mind of a thinking being (existence,\nnamely, in the mind of the one who thinks this proposition and who\nmakes the judgment); but the mere proposition in itself (or the\nobjective proposition) I count among the kinds of things that\ndo not have any existence whatsoever, and never can attain existence.\nOur thinking of a proposition, our judgment that a\nthing is so and so, is something actual, which began at a certain time\nand will end at a certain time; the written signs, through\nwhich we record these propositions in some place or other are equally\nreally existing things; the propositions themselves, however, do not\nexist in any time or place (Bolzano 2004a: 40\u201341). \n\n\nThe expression \u2018in itself\u2019, as Bolzano explains elsewhere,\nis used to indicate that a term is used in its full generality, and\nhence that any customary tacit additions (such as thought or\nexpressed in a language) should be suppressed\n(TS,\u00a7 57, no. 2). In view of the unhelpful Kantian\nassociations with the expression \u2018in itself\u2019,\nBolzano\u2019s expression \u2018an sich\u2019 might also\nbe rendered as \u2018as such \u2019 (as suggested by Jan Berg) or\n\u2018per se\u2019.\n\nBolzano maintained that there are (es gibt)\npropositions in themselves, though they are not actual\n(wirklich), that is, do not act, or enter into causal\nrelations. Thus they have the status often accorded to mathematical\nobjects. And although he thought that the recognition of propositions\nin themselves was crucial for metaphysics, he also sought to persuade\nthose who did not share his metaphysical views to accept propositions\nbased on pragmatic and methodological considerations (TS,\n\u00a720, no. 1).\n\nIn this article, we will follow the common practice of the secondary\nliterature on Bolzano by using square brackets to form designations of\npropositions in themselves and like entities. Thus, for instance,\n\u2018[Socrates has wisdom]\u2019 designates the proposition in\nitself expressed by the sentence \u2018Socrates has wisdom\u2019,\nwhile \u2018[Socrates]\u2019 designates the part of that proposition\n(or idea) designated by \u2018Socrates\u2019.\n3.1 Forms of propositions\n\nIn Bolzano\u2019s view, propositions can be expressed more or less\nadequately by sentences, and consideration of linguistic structures\naccordingly informs his treatment of the parts and structures of\npropositions. Consider a sentence such as \u2018Romeo loves\nJuliet\u2019, for instance. We recognize that we could replace\n\u2018Romeo\u2019 with another proper name such as\n\u2018Othello\u2019 and still have a perfectly grammatical sentence.\nMoreover, given a set of proper names, we can specify a class of\nsentences that differ from \u2018Romeo loves Juliet\u2019 at most by\nhaving a different one of those names at the beginning. We could\nproceed similarly with \u2018loves\u2019 and a suitable set of\ntransitive verbs. Or we could consider the class of sentences\nobtainable when both sorts of replacements are permitted, and so on.\nThese classes of sentences would correspond to the sentential\nforms \u2018a loves Juliet\u2019, \u2018Romeo V\nJuliet\u2019, and \u2018a V Juliet\u2019, respectively.\n\nSo too, Bolzano clearly thinks, with propositions in themselves. Given\na proposition, we can think of others just like it except for having\ndifferent parts (ideas) at certain places. And though there can be no\nactual variation, i.e., no change in time, in the realm of\npropositions in themselves, nor any places strictly speaking, we can\nnonetheless speak metaphorically of making substitutions at certain\nplaces within propositions, using this as a fa\u00e7on de\nparler about atemporal relations between propositions and their\nparts. Given a proposition, then, we can consider certain of its parts\nvariable, i.e., subject to replacement by other parts, and,\ngiven classes of suitable substituends for each site of substitution,\nwe can again determine a class of propositions.\n\nIf certain parts of a sentence correspond to parts of the proposition\nit expresses, the sentential forms we obtain by replacing one or more\nof these parts with signs for variables, along with a specification of\npermissible substituends, will determine not just a class of sentences\nbut also a class of propositions of the kind just described. Bolzano\nsometimes calls such classes of propositions propositional\nforms. Strictly speaking, however, he reserves this term for the\nsentential forms that determine such classes:\n\n\n[T]he proposition \u201cSome people have white skin\u201d occurs in\nlogic at best as an example, and not as the subject of a theorem,\nwhile a class of propositions, such as the class determined by the\nexpression \u201cSome A are B\u201d may well be the\nsubject of a theorem. If these classes of propositions are to be\ncalled general forms of propositions, then it is permissible\nto say that logic is concerned with forms rather than with individual\npropositions. (Actually, only the written or oral expression\n\u201cSome A are B\u201d, and not the class itself,\nshould be called a form) (TS, \u00a712, no. 2 [I.48]). \n\n\nNote that a sentence need not be perfectly distinct (i.e., such that\nthere is a one-to-one structure-preserving correspondence between its\nparts and the parts of the proposition is expresses) to be used in\nthis way, provided only that the parts of the sentence that are\nreplaced by signs for variables do correspond to parts of the\nproposition. For instance, if we are satisfied that\n\u2018mammal\u2019 and \u2018bear\u2019 correspond to parts of the\nproposition [Some mammal is a bear], we can use the sentential form\n\u2018Some A is a B\u2019 to determine a class of propositions, even\nif it turns out that this proposition might be more distinctly\nexpressed by a different sentence, e.g., by \u2018There exists an\nindividual that is a mammal and that is also a bear.\u2019\n\nSince different parts of a proposition may be considered variable,\neach proposition belongs to a number of different forms. In\nparticular, there is no absolute distinction between the form and\nmatter of propositions on Bolzano\u2019s definition.\n4. Ideas\n\nAs mentioned above, Bolzano defines an idea as a part of a\nproposition, more precisely, as \u201cany constituent of a\nproposition that is not itself a proposition\u201d (TS,\n\u00a7128, no. 2 [II.18]; cf. \u00a748). For example, assuming the\nsentence \u2018Fido, who is a dog, is not a reptile\u2019 to be a\nfairly distinct expression of the corresponding proposition, we might\ndistinguish within that proposition ideas (i.e., sub-propositional\nparts) such as [Fido], [dog], [reptile], but also [who], [is], and\n[not]. As with propositions, Bolzano carefully distinguishes between\nideas in themselves, thought (or subjective) ideas, and linguistic\nsigns for ideas.\n\nBolzano\u2019s term is \u2018Vorstellung\u2019. This was\nthe standard rendering of \u2018idea\u2019 in German translations of\nLocke, Hume, et al. It is also sometimes rendered as\n\u2018presentation\u2019 or \u2018representation\u2019, e.g., in\ntranslations of the works of Kant and Husserl. Bolzano\u2019s\ndecision to continue to use the term tends to obscure the vast\ndifferences between his views and those he found in the logical\nliterature of his time. Ideas, for him, are akin to Husserl\u2019s\npart-meanings or to Fregean senses other than thoughts. This is not at\nall what most of the authors Bolzano discussed meant when they spoke\nof ideas, even if there was a tiny point of contact in the\ncircumstance that, like him, those authors usually maintained that\nideas (or notions, concepts, cognitions) could occur as parts of\njudgments, namely, as their subjects and predicates.\n\nBolzano recognizes three individuating features of ideas with objects\n: extension, content, and structure. Loosely\nspeaking, the extension of an idea is \u201cthe collection of all the\nobjects standing under it\u201d (Bolzano 2004a: 46); more strictly,\nit is \u201cthat particular attribute of an idea by virtue of which\nit represents only those and no other objects.\u201d (TS,\n\u00a766, I:298). While ideas with different extensions, for example,\n[prime number] and [odd number], are perforce different on\nBolzano\u2019s account, this is only a sufficient condition, witness\nthe coextensive but clearly different ideas [even prime number] and\n[positive square root of 4].\n\nThough these ideas are coextensive, we can still distinguish them by\nnoting that they have different parts, e.g., that [prime] occurs in\nthe first, but not in the second. Bolzano will say in such cases that\nthe content of the two ideas is different. According to his\ndefinition, the content of a complex idea is the sum of its\nparts. \u2018Sum\u2019 is a technical term in Bolzano\u2019s\nontology, designating collections \u201cin which the manner of\ncombination does not matter and in which the parts of the parts may be\nconsidered parts of the whole\u201d (TS, \u00a784). For our\npurposes, it is sufficient to note that when Bolzano asks us to think\nabout the content of an idea, he wants us to consider its parts, but\nnot their arrangement.\n\nTo resume: ideas with different content also differ. Once again,\nhowever, this condition is merely sufficient, as the same parts can be\narranged differently, witness: [ignorant son of a learned father],\n[learned son of an ignorant father]. Accordingly, Bolzano recognizes\nthe structure of a complex idea, the way its parts are\ncombined (their Verbindungsart), as an additional\nindividuating attribute. Indeed, sometimes structure is the only\nindividuating attribute, as Bolzano shows in TS (\u00a796,\nno. 2) with the clever example of [\\(2^{4}\\)] and [\\(4^{2}\\)], which\nhave the same content and the same extension but differ\nnonetheless.\n\nAlthough in many cases ideas are assumed to be structured like\nlinguistic expressions, it is also clear that Bolzano recognized ideas\nwhose structure cannot be captured in a linear script. For example, in\nideas of the form \u2018\\(A\\), which has the properties \\(b, b',\nb'',\\ldots\\)\u2019, no ordering is supposed between the parts \\(b,\nb', b'',\\ldots\\), which occur in the idea in itself as a unordered\ncollection (Menge).\n\nBolzano was a semantic atomist: in his view, all ideas are ultimately\ncomposed of simple parts, which are themselves ideas (TS,\n\u00a761). In the case of simple ideas with objects, there is no\ncontent strictly speaking since there are no parts, and hence no\nstructure either. Thus such ideas are individuated by their extensions\nalone (TS, \u00a793, no. 3). The relation of a simple idea to\nits objects is primitive, hence undefinable. It is instructive to\ncompare this position with the contemporary practice of interpreting a\nformal language by assigning extensions (objects or sets of objects)\nto the non-logical constants (or parameters).\n\nBolzano does not tell us how simple ideas without objects (e.g.,\n[and], [not]) are individuated. This strikes us as a significant\noversight.\n4.1 Varieties of ideas\n\nSome ideas, called objectual (gegenst\u00e4ndlich)\nby Bolzano, have, or represent, one or more objects, for instance,\n[the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem], [raven]. Others are\nobjectless (gegenstandlos), e.g., [round square],\n[golden mountain], [not] (TS, \u00a767). Not recognizing\nempty collections, Bolzano says that objectless ideas have no\nextensions.\n\nIf an idea has exactly one object, it is called singular,\nand, if has more than one, general (\u00a768). Some general\nideas are complex, e.g., [star of the first magnitude]. Others,\nBolzano maintains, are simple: he thinks that [object] and [attribute]\nare likely such. In the case of singular ideas, similarly, he holds\nthat some are complex, e.g., [the most massive planet in our solar\nsystem], while others are simple. Appropriating Kant\u2019s term for\nhis own purposes, he calls the latter kind of ideas, that is, simple,\nsingular ideas, intuitions (\u00a772). Ideas that are not\nintuitions and do not have any intuitions among their parts are called\n(pure) concepts, while ideas that have both concepts and\nintuitions among their parts are called mixed (\u00a773).\n\nThose familiar with the role played by logically proper names in\nRussell\u2019s philosophy of logical atomism will have an easier time\nunderstanding Bolzano\u2019s use of the concept of an intuition.\nIntuitions are the counterpart in the realm of ideas in themselves to\nthe essentially indexical elements in language: they are best\nexpressed by using a bare demonstrative (\u2018this\u2019) and, in\nthe case of subjective human intuitions, always have particular\ncontemporaneous mental states as their objects. Any singular idea of a\ncontingently existing particular, moreover, must number intuitions\namong its parts. Intuitions thus serve as markers of empirical\ncontent. \n\nIf no part of a proposition is an intuition, it is called purely\nconceptual, otherwise intuitional. This distinction,\ndefined at the level of propositions in themselves, is prior to the\ndistinction between a priori and a posteriori\njudgements, and used to define it:\n\n\nIf the propositions from which a judgement M is deduced, as\nwell as those from which the former follow, down to the immediate\njudgements, are all purely conceptual propositions, then judgement\nM can be called a judgement from pure concepts, or\npure, or a priori. In all other cases it could be\nsaid to be drawn from experience or a posteriori\n(TS, \u00a7306, no.12). \n\n\nSome sciences, e.g., number theory or real analysis, consist entirely\nof purely conceptual propositions, and are accordingly called\npurely conceptual sciences. Though Bolzano optimistically\nheld that most purely conceptual truths could be known a\npriori, he refrains from claiming this of all of them, and\nclearly recognizes that many purely conceptual propositions, even in\nmathematics, are accepted based at least partly on empirical\n(intuitional) evidence (TS, \u00a7133; Bolzano 2004a: 53).\n\n4.2 Extensional relations between ideas: the logic of classes\n\nOf the two main parts of Bolzano\u2019s formal logic, the extensional\nlogic of ideas (the logic of classes) and the extensional logic of\npropositions, the first part comes from a long tradition beginning\nwith Boethius (and derived from Aristotelian syllogistic) and ending\n\u2014 in Bolzano\u2019s times \u2014 with Gergonne. Bolzano did\nnot take his logic of classes from Gergonne or Euler, the most\ninfluential authors in their time, but rather from a small booklet\nentitled Outline of Logic (Grundri\u00df der Logik)\nby a now completely forgotten logician, J.G.E. Maa\u00df, published\nin 1793.\n\nIn TS, \u00a7\u00a7 94\u2013108, Bolzano defines a system of\nrelations between the extensions of ideas, and proves various theorems\nabout these relations. To begin with, ideas \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are\nsaid to be compatible just in case there is at least one\nobject that stands under all of them; otherwise, they are called\nincompatible. In the case in which not only some but all objects\nrepresented by \\(A\\) are also represented by \\(B\\), \\(A\\) is said to\nbe included in \\(B\\). If the converse also holds, i.e., if\n\\(A\\) is included in \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) included in \\(A\\), the ideas\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are called equivalent (or\ninterchangeable). He defines two further special cases:\nfirst, compatibility where neither \\(A\\) is included in \\(B\\), nor\n\\(B\\) in \\(A\\); Bolzano calls this relation overlapping or\nlinking. Second, we have the relation of\nsubordination, which is inclusion without reciprocity.\n\nThree kinds of incompatibility are distinguished: mutual exclusion,\ncontradiction and contrariety. Ideas \\(A\\), \\(B\\), C, \u2026\nare said to exclude each other iff they are pairwise\nincompatible. The ideas \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are contradictory iff \\(B\\)\nhas \u201can extension that includes everything that does not stand\nunder the idea \\(A\\)\u201d (TS II, \u00a7103, 477), i.e. if\n\\(B\\) is equivalent to non-A. They are contrary,\nfinally, iff they are incompatible but not contradictory.\n\nAs all these relations are derived from compatibility and its\nnegation, it is possible to represent them in the form of a\ngenealogical tree (see \u0160ebest\u00edk 1992: 174). Simplifying\nsomewhat, we can define Bolzano\u2019s relations for pairs of ideas\nin the language of set theory as shown below. (Here, we depart from\nBolzano by also admitting universal ideas such as \u201csomething in\ngeneral\u201d [Etwas \u00fcberhaupt], along with objectless\nideas and the empty set as their extension (for Bolzano, an objectless\nidea has no extension, and there are no empty collections)). \n\n\n\\(A \\textrm{ is } \\textit{compatible} \\textrm{ with } B \\)\n\\( =_{\\textrm{df}} \\)\n\\(Ext(A) \\cap Ext(B) \\not= \\emptyset\\) \n\n\\(A \\textrm{ is }\\textit{incompatible}\\textrm{ with } B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(Ext(A) \\cap Ext(B) = \\emptyset\\) \n\n\\(A\\textrm{ is }\\textit{included}\\textrm{ in } B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(A\\) is compatible with \\(B\\) and \\(Ext(A) \\subseteq\nExt(B)\\) \n\n\\(A\\textrm{ is }\\textit{equivalent}\\textrm{ to }B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(A\\) is included in \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) is included in \\(A\\)\n\n\n\\(A\\textrm{ is }\\textit{subordinate}\\textrm{ to }B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(A\\) is included in but not equivalent to \\(B\\) \n\n\\(A\\textrm{ is }\\textit{contradictory}\\textrm{ with } B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(A\\) is incompatible with \\(B\\) and \\( Ext(A) \\cup Ext(B) =\n\\textrm{universal class}\\) \n\n\\(A\\) is contrary to \\(B\\)\n\\(=_{\\textrm{df}}\\)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are incompatible but not contradictory.\n\n\n5. The analysis of propositions\n\nIf Bolzano\u2019s thesis of semantic atomism is correct, then there\nis a finest form for every proposition; namely, the one in\nwhich every simple idea in the proposition is considered independently\nvariable. We can see from this the task that confronts someone who\nseeks to define the concept of a proposition as a certain kind of\nstructured whole using formation rules: this would require not only a\nspecification of all possible syntactic structures, but also a\ncomplete set of semantic categories (since different sites of\nvariation may come with different classes of admissible items).\nMoreover, it would be necessary to do this not just for a formal\nlanguage of our own devising, or for a single natural language, but\nfor any possible language. Seen in this light, Bolzano\u2019s\nforthright admission that he could find no satisfactory definition of\nthe concept of a proposition is hardly surprising.\n\nInstead of trying to begin with simple ideas and construct\npropositions from them, Bolzano works from the outside in, trying to\ndistinguish parts within propositions, generally following what Quine\ncalled the \u201cmaxim of shallow analysis\u201d, namely,\n\u201cexpose no more logical structure than seems useful for the\ndeduction or other inquiry at hand\u201d (Quine, 1960: \u00a733;\n160). Since propositions in themselves are causally inert, this cannot\nbe done by inspecting them. Rather, one considers linguistic\nexpressions, drawn from a variety of languages, along with one\u2019s\nown thoughts, and attempts to identify features of logical\nsignificance, bearing in mind that \u201ccommon usage does not aim at\nlogical correctness but rather at brevity and sufficient\ndistinctness.\u201d (TS, \u00a7170 [II.213]; see also\n\u00a7350, 366).\n\nBolzano makes a number of specific proposals concerning the analysis\nof propositions, most of them now of merely historical interest. We\nwill briefly present a few of these here.\n\nFirst, he argues that every proposition belongs to the\nsubject-predicate form \u2018\\(A\\) has \\(b\\)\u2019 (TS,\n\u00a7 127; recall that this does not prevent them from also belonging\nto other forms.) He acknowledges that he has no conclusive argument\nfor his thesis, but claims that he has been able to find acceptable\nsubject-predicate paraphrases of all the sentence forms that have\noccurred to him (Bolzano 1843: 48).\n\nIn true propositions of this form, the place marked by\n\u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 is occupied by an idea that has one or more\nobjects, while the place marked by \u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 is occupied by\nan idea representing one or more attributes. The copula, expressed by\n\u2018has\u2019, understood to be without tense or number, indicates\nthe possession of an attribute. Tense is dealt with by adding temporal\ndeterminers to the subject-idea. For example, \u2018Smith is in\npain\u2019 would be more distinctly expressed as \u2018Smith at the\npresent moment\u2013has (tenselessly)\u2013pain\u2019 (\u00a7127,\nno. 5).\n\nSince both the subject- and predicate-ideas may be general, we must\nunderstand \u2018\\(A\\) has \\(b\\)\u2019 to convey that every object\nstanding under the idea [\\(A\\)] has an attribute standing under the\nidea [\\(b\\)] (\u00a7131). Accordingly, he takes propositions of the\nform \u2018All \\(A\\) have \\(b\\)\u2019 to be synonymous with those of\nthe forms \u2018Each \\(A\\) has \\(b\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(A\\) has\n\\(b\\)\u2019, e.g., \u2018All men have mortality\u2019, \u2018Each\nman has mortality\u2019, and \u2018Man has mortality.\u2019\n\nBolzano believes that the subject-predicate form can accommodate\nrelational claims, interpreting them as statements about collections.\nFor instance, a claim that items \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are equal in the\nsense of all having attributes \\(b, b', b'', \\ldots\\) could be\ninterpreted as a claim about a collection containing two unordered\nsub-collections (Mengen), i.e., \\(\\langle (A, B, C, \\ldots),\n(b, b', b'', \\ldots)\\rangle\\), stating that the collection has the\nattribute that every item in the first sub-collection has each of the\nattributes in the second sub-collection (cf. \u00a7135, no.15).\n\nFor Bolzano, truth and falsity (or lack-of-truth) are properties of\npropositions. Given his assumption that all propositions belong to the\nform \u2018\\(A\\) has \\(b\\)\u2019, he is able to offer the following\ndefinition of truth (TS, \u00a728):\n\n\nA proposition is true when it states what belongs to its object. \n That is,\n\n\n\n[A has b] has truth iff A has b. \n\n\nBolzano\u2019s analysis of existential claims such as \u2018There\nare prime numbers greater than 100\u2019 is also noteworthy. What we\nmean in such cases, he says, is that the idea [prime number greater\nthan 100] has objectuality (\u00a7137). This analysis shows its worth\nin the case of true negative existentials such as \u2018Round squares\ndo not exist\u2019, allowing him to solve the associated riddle of\nnon-being. For this sentence says the same as the more distinct\n\u2018[Round square] has lack-of-objectuality\u2019 according to\nBolzano, and, in this case, we have an objectual subject-idea (its\nobject is the idea [round square]) and ascribe to its object\na property that it has (namely, objectlessness) (\u00a7138).\n\nBolzano proposes similar analyses of forms such as \u2018Some \\(A\\)\nare \\(B\\)\u2019 and \u2018No \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\u2019. These are taken\nto be more distinctly expressed as follows: \u2018[\\(A\\), which has\n\\(b\\)] has objectuality\u2019, and \u2018[\\(A\\), which has \\(b\\)]\nhas non-objectuality\u2019, respectively (\u00a7137,138).\n\nClaims of objectuality are not to be confused with claims of\nactuality (\u00a7142). Though, for example, Bolzano\nmaintained that there are (es gibt) propositions and ideas in\nthemselves, as well as geometrical points and other mathematical\nobjects, he denied at the same time that they had actual existence\n(i.e., they do not act, or enter into causal relations, no spatial or\ntemporal determinations attach to them, etc.). The ideas [proposition\nin itself], [geometrical point], etc., that is, have objectuality but\npropositions, points, etc., lack the property of actuality.\n\nBolzano distinguishes predicate and propositional negation, the former\ntaking the form \u2018\\(A\\) has non-\\(b\\)\u2019, the latter\n\u2018[\\(A\\) has \\(b\\)] has non-truth\u2019 (\u00a7189, 1(e); cf.\n\u00a7136). The two forms are not equivalent, since, for example,\n[Mozart\u2019s 35th piano concerto is not in E-flat] is false, its\nsubject-idea being objectless, while [[Mozart\u2019s 35th piano\nconcerto is in E-flat] has non-truth] is true.\n\nMaterial disjunctions, i.e., claims of the forms \u2018\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\nor \\(C \\ldots\\)\u2019 are paraphrased as follows (\u00a7181):\n\u2018[True proposition in the collection (\\([A], [B], [C],\n\\ldots\\))] has objectuality\u2019 (inclusive disjunction) or as\n\u2018[True proposition in the collection \\(([A], [B], [C],\n\\ldots\\))] has objectuality and [Plurality of true propositions in the\ncollection (\\([A], [B], [C], \\ldots\\))] has non-objectuality\u2019\n(exclusive disjunction).\n\nWe hope this is enough to give some sense of Bolzano\u2019s approach\nand some of its limitations. More details may be found in the\nsecondary literature.\n6. Bolzano\u2019s logic of variation\n6.1 Propositions and propositional forms\n\nBolzano\u2019s logic of extensional relations between propositions\nrepresents a major innovation which has no equivalent in traditional\nlogic. It is based on the method of variation that we have already\nencountered. Bolzano introduces this part of his logic as follows:\n\n\nGiven a proposition, we could merely inquire whether it is true or\nfalse. But some very remarkable properties of propositions can be\ndiscovered if, in addition, we consider the truth values of all those\npropositions which can be generated from them, if we take some of\ntheir constituent ideas as variable and replace them by any other\nideas whatever (TS, \u00a7 147). \n\n\nOften, Bolzano uses sentential forms such as \u2018The man A\nis mortal\u2019 in his discussions. At other times, he will simply\nwrite something like this: \u201cLet us \u2026 consider the\nproposition \u2018The man Caius is mortal\u2019, and let us envisage\nthe idea \u2018Caius\u2019 as arbitrarily variable\u201d\n(TS, \u00a7 147).\n\nThese two manners of speaking correspond to two different levels. On\nthe first, linguistic level, we deal with sentential forms, i.e.,\nexpressions containing signs for variables, which become sentences\n(and express propositions) after appropriate substitutions are made.\nThe second level is the level of propositions and ideas in themselves,\nthe level of meaning. Here, Bolzano cannot use variables, letters or\nother indeterminate signs, for, in the realm of the propositions and\nideas in themselves, there are no indeterminate entities that would\ncorrespond to sentential forms; there are only propositions, true or\nfalse. This might be the reason for Bolzano\u2019s cumbersome way of\nspeaking about \u201cthe idea Caius considered\nvariable\u201d.\n\nBolzano\u2019s loose manner of speaking about substitutions of ideas\nin propositions is adopted in what follows. To declare one or several\nideas in a given proposition variable is to consider the class of all\npropositions which have the same structure and contain the same ideas\nexcept perhaps at places occupied by the variable ideas. A proposition\nwhich results from such a substitution performed on the given\nproposition is called a variant.\n\nThe class of allowable substituends is often restricted by Bolzano; in\nsome cases, for instance, he will require that the substitutions do\nnot \u201cdestroy the objectuality of the proposition,\u201d that\nis, do not produce an objectless subject-idea. Such would be, for\nexample, the effect of substituting [Beijing] for [Nero] in the\nproposition [Nero, who is a human being, is mortal]. In his discussion\nof the degree of validity of a proposition relative to certain ideas,\ntoo, he stipulates that no two equivalent ideas may be included in the\nclass of possible substituends. Thus when Bolzano speaks of\n\u201cvariable ideas\u201d, we should bear in mind that the\nspecification of a variable also involves the specification of a range\nof possible values.\n6.2 Universal validity/invalidity and analyticity\n\nBolzano begins by defining attributes of of single propositions with\nvariable parts (TS, \u00a7147). When the method of variation\nis applied to a proposition, he notes, three different cases may\narise: either the class of (objectual) propositions obtained by\nsubstitution contains only true propositions, or it contains only\nfalse propositions, or it contains both true and false propositions.\nIn the first case, the initial proposition is called universally\nvalid, in the second universally invalid, in both cases\nrelative to the specified variables. Bolzano does not give a name to\nthe third case; such propositions could be called neutral. Here are\nsome examples:\n\n[The man Caius is mortal] \n\nis universally valid relative to the variable idea [Caius], because\neach appropriate substitution generates a true proposition, or\nalternatively, because all its objectual variants are true.\n\n[The man Caius is omniscient]\n\nis universally invalid relative to the same variable idea [Caius],\nbecause all its variants are false. \n\nThe same proposition\n\n[The man Caius is wealthy]\n\nis neutral relative to the variable idea [wealthy], because some of\nits variants are true (e.g., the first example quoted) while others\nare false (the second example).\n\nConsider now the proposition [Murgatroyd\u2019s favourite number, which is\nan integer between 1 and 10, is prime], and let [Murgatroyd\u2019s\nfavourite number] be tagged as variable. Furthermore, let us restrict\nthe class of permissible substituends by stipulating that (1)\nobjectuality be preserved and (2) no two equivalent ideas be included.\nIn this case, there will be eight permissible substitutions and, of\nthese, four will result in true propositions. The ratio of the number\nof substitutions resulting in true propositions to the total number is\naccordingly equal to 1:2. Bolzano calls this the degree of\nvalidity of the proposition relative to the specified variables.\nHe comments (TS, II: 81): \u201cThis ratio determines the\ndegree of probability which the proposition takes on under certain\ncircumstances.\u201d Universal validity and universal invalidity are\nextreme cases, in which the ratio is respectively equal to 1:1 and\n0:1.\n\nBolzano appropriated Kant\u2019s term analytic for\npropositions that are either universally valid or universally invalid\nrelative to some specification of variable parts or other. This choice\nof terminology was based on his analysis of Kant\u2019s examples.\nConsider, for instance, the proposition (Kant: judgement): [A\nright-angled triangle is a triangle]. Kant had declared such judgments\nanalytic because analysis, i.e., decomposition, of the subject concept\nwould reveal the presence of the predicate. For Bolzano, this\ncontainment relation was just a distraction: what was truly\ninteresting about this proposition, he thought, was that we could\nsubstitute whatever other ideas we like for [triangle] and\n[right-angled] without changing the truth-value (subject to the\nproviso about objectuality). That is, as Quine would later put it,\ncertain parts of such propositions occur vacuously: \n\n\nI believe that th[e] importance [of analytic propositions] lies in the\nfact that their truth or falsity does not depend upon the individual\nideas of which they are composed, but that it remains the same\nirrespective of the changes to which some of their ideas are\nsubjected, provided only that the objectuality of the proposition is\nnot destroyed (TS, \u00a7 148). \n\n\nThe truly noteworthy feature of the propositions Kant had called\nanalytic, that is, is the invariance of their truth-value under an\nentire class of transformations. It is this feature and no other that\nBolzano singles out with his definition of analyticity.\n\nGiven the breadth of Bolzano\u2019s definition, it is clear that\nanalytic propositions are quite common, notably in mathematics. Here\nare some of Bolzano\u2019s examples of analytic propositions, true as\nwell as false, where the underlining or the letters indicate the\nvariable parts:\n\nIf all men are mortal and Caius is a\nman, then Caius is mortal.\n(TS,\u00a7315)\nIf A is larger than B, then B is smaller than A.\n(TS,\u00a7148)\nIf \\(P=Mm\\), then \\(M = P/m\\). (TS, \u00a7148)\nThe soul of Socrates has been annihilated. (TS,\n\u00a7 369)\nThe soul of Socrates is a simple substance. (TS,\n\u00a7447)\nA is A. (TS, \u00a7148)\nAn A, which is B, is A. (TS, \u00a7148)\nAn A, which is B, is B. (TS, \u00a7148)\nEvery object is either B or non-B. (TS, \u00a7148)\n\n\nThe last four examples in the above list are noteworthy, Bolzano\nclaims, because the only invariable parts in them are logical\nconcepts. He speaks of logical analyticity in such cases.\nLike Tarski after him, he comments that his definition of logical\nanalyticity is not completely determinate, because the \u201cdomain\nof concepts belonging to logic is not circumscribed so sharply that\ncontroversies could not arise at times\u201d (TS, \u00a7\n148, no. 3; Tarski, 1983, 418\u2013419).\n\nThough the similarities should not be exaggerated, there are clear\naffinities between this narrower notion and later ones in the works of\nAdjukiewicz, Carnap, Quine, and Tarski (see K\u00fcnne, 2006 for\ndetailed discussion).\n\nAs Bolzano was well aware, analyticity in his general sense entails\nneither necessity nor apriority (TS, \u00a7197). [Truman, who\nwas president of the USA in in the 20th century, was male], for\ninstance, is universally valid with respect to [Truman], and thus\nanalytic according to Bolzano\u2019s definition. Clearly, his use of\nthe term \u2018analytic\u2019 differs radically not only from\nKant\u2019s, but also from later uses of the term in the writings of\nFrege, Carnap, and others. This has led to some misunderstandings on\nthe part of some of his later readers (e.g., Bar-Hillel, 1950).\n6.3 Relations among several propositions with variable parts\n\nIn contemporary treatments of logic, logical relations between\nformulas of a formal language are sometimes defined in terms of\nrelations between sets of interpretations of the language. For\nexample, a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) might be said to imply\na formula \\(\\alpha\\) iff the set of interpretations making all members\nof \\(\\Gamma\\) true is a subset of the set of interpretations\nmaking \\(\\alpha\\) true, while \\(\\Gamma\\) itself might be said to be\nsatisfiable iff the set of interpretations making all its\nmembers true is non-empty.\n\nBolzano\u2019s system of extensional relations between propositions\nwith variable ideas is motivated by similar thoughts, though it is\ncast in terms of the extensions of ideas, propositions, and variable\nideas within them. The key notion is that of a collection of ideas\n\\(i\u2019, j\u2019, k\u2019, \\ldots\\) which, when substituted for\nthe variable ideas \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\) in propositions \\(A, B, C,\n\\ldots\\), results in a collection of propositions all of which are\ntrue. (More loosely, Bolzano speaks of \u201ccollections of ideas\nwhose substitution for \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\), makes all of \\(A, B, C,\n\\ldots\\) true\u201d (TS II: \u00a7155, 114, 122, and\n\u00a7156, 133).) We will call such collections of ideas \\(i\u2019,\nj\u2019, k\u2019, \\ldots\\) verifying ideas for \\(A, B, C,\n\\ldots\\) relative to the variable ideas \\(i, j, k, \\ldots.\\)\n\nIn a crucial passage, Bolzano sets up the correspondence he needs to\ncarry out his plan:\n\n\nWith ideas, the crucial question was whether or not a certain object\nis indeed represented by them; the corresponding question for\npropositions is whether or not they are true. Just as I have called\nideas compatible or incompatible with each other, depending on whether\nor not they have certain objects in common, so I call propositions\ncompatible or incompatible, depending on whether or not there are\ncertain ideas which make all of them true. (TS II: \u00a7154,\n101; Bolzano 1973: 198\u2013199)\n\n\nThat is, just as ideas \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are said to be\ncompatible iff at least one object stands under each of \\(A,\nB, C, \\ldots\\), so too we can say that propositions \\(A, B,\nC, \\ldots\\) are compatible with respect to variable ideas \\(i, j, k,\n\\ldots\\) iff there is at least one collection of ideas \\(i\u2019,\nj\u2019, k\u2019, \\ldots\\) which are verifying ideas for each of\n\\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\). Equivalently, \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are compatible\nrelative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\) iff the ideas [verifying\nideas for \\(A\\) relative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)], [verifying ideas for\n\\(B\\) relative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)], [verifying ideas for \\(C\\)\nrelative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)] are compatible in the previously\ndefined sense; otherwise, they are said to be incompatible.\n\nFor example, the propositions [Wellington predeceased Napoleon] and\n[Napoleon predeceased Wellington] are incompatible when all\noccurrences of [Napoleon] and [Wellington] are considered uniformly\nvariable, but compatible when [predeceased] is varied in both\npropositions, since the substitution [fought] for [predeceased]\nproduces two true propositions. (Here, we have to do with the forms\n\u2018 \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) predeceased \\(\\mathbf{B}\\)\u2019 and \u2018\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) predeceased \\(\\mathbf{A}\\)\u2019 in the first case,\nand \u2018Napoleon R Wellington\u2019 and \u2018Wellington\nR Napoleon\u2019 in the second.)\n\nNext, propositions \\(M, N, O, \\ldots\\) are said to be\ndeducible from propositions \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) with respect\nto variable ideas \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\) iff \\(A, B, C, \\ldots, M, N, O,\n\\ldots\\) are compatible with respect to variable ideas \\(i, j, k,\n\\ldots\\) and the idea [verifying ideas for \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\)\nrelative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)] is included in the idea [verifying\nideas for \\(M, N, O, \\ldots\\) relative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)] in the\npreviously defined sense, i.e., iff the extension of the former is a\nsubset of the extension of the latter (TS, \u00a7 155). \n\nIn the shorter version of his logic, Bolzano states this definition as\nfollows:\n\n\nIf one or more propositions \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are compatible with\none or more others \\(M, N, \\ldots\\) with respect to the components\n\\(i, j, \\ldots\\), then there must be, as just said, at least some\nideas that, when put in the places of \\(i, j, \\ldots\\) make all of\n\\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) as well as all of \\(M, N, \\ldots\\) true. One\nespecially noteworthy case occurs, however, if not just some, but\nall of the ideas that, when substituted for \\(i, j, \\ldots\\)\nin \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) make all these true, also make all of \\(M, N,\n\\ldots\\) true. In this case I say that the propositions \\(M, N,\n\\ldots\\) stand in the relation of deducibility to the\npropositions \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) with respect to the variable parts\n\\(i, j, \\ldots\\) (Bolzano 2004a: 54), \n\n\n\u2014giving the following examples: [All \\(i\\) are \\(k\\)] is\ndeducible from [All \\(i\\) are \\(j\\)] and [All \\(j\\) are \\(k\\)] , and\n[\\(\\angle ijk = \\angle ikj\\)] is deducible from [\\(i, j, k\\) are the\nthree vertices of a triangle] and [\\(\\overline{ij}\\) =\n\\(\\overline{ik}\\)], in both cases with respect to \\(i, j, k\\).\n\nProceeding in this way through his table of relations among ideas,\nBolzano obtains at one stroke a complete system of extensional\nrelations between propositions, relative to certain of their parts\nconsidered variable (in other words, between propositional\nforms in the sense of classes of propositions). The\nresult is a genealogical tree whose fundamental structure is exactly\nthe same as the structure of the tree representing the relations\nbetween ideas. In most cases, he uses the same terms, speaking of\ncompatibility, deducibility (inclusion), subordination (unilateral\ndeducibility), equivalence (mutual deducibility), overlapping,\ncontrariety, and contradiction among propositions. \n\nTo obtain a clearer overview of these relations, let us introduce some\nnotation and once again use the language of set theory. We will use\nbold letters to symbolize sets of items (propositions or variable\nideas). Thus, for instance, \u2018\\(\\mathbf{A(i)}\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(\\mathbf{M(i)}\\)\u2019 will be used to represent sets of\npropositions \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\{A, B, C, \\ldots\\}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{M}=\\{M,\nN, O, \\ldots\\}\\) in which the ideas \\(\\mathbf{i}=i, j, k, \\ldots\\) are\nconsidered variable. Let \\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))}\\) represent the set of\nverifying ideas for \\(\\mathbf{A(i)}\\). Finally, let \\(\\mathbf{\\neg\nA}\\) represent \\(\\{\\neg A, \\neg B, \\neg C, \\ldots\\}\\). We then\nhave:\n\n\nA is compatible with M with respect\nto variable ideas i:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))} \\cap \\mathbf{V(M(i))} \\not= \\emptyset\\)\n\nA is incompatible with M with\nrespect to i:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))} \\cap \\mathbf{V(M(i))} = \\emptyset\\)\n\nM is deducible [ableitbar] from\nA with respect to i:\n\nA and M are compatible with respect\nto i and \\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))} \\subseteq\n\\mathbf{V(M(i))}\\).\n\nA is equivalent to M with respect to\ni:\n\nA is deducible from M and\nM is deducible from A, both with\nrespect to i, i.e., \\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))} \\not=\n\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))} = \\mathbf{V(M(i))}\\).\n\nM is unilaterally deducible from A\nwith respect to i:\n\nM is deducible from but not equivalent to\nA with respect to i.\n\nA and M are contradictory with\nrespect to i:\n\n\\(\\neg\\mathbf{A}\\) is equivalent to M and\nA equivalent to \\(\\neg\\mathbf{M}\\), both with respect\nto i.\n\nA and M are contrary with respect to\ni:\n\nA and M are incompatible but not\ncontradictory with respect to i.\n Bolzano states and proves a substantial collection of theorems\nabout his relations, including the following:\n\n\nIf \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are incompatible with respect to\ni then any collection of propositions that contains\n\\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) is also incompatible with respect to\ni (TS,\u00a7154, no. 10).\nIf A is compatible with respect to \\(i, j,\n\\ldots\\), then it is also compatible w.r.t. any collection of variands\nthat contains \\(i, j, \\ldots \\) (\u00a7154, no. 11).\nIf \\(M\\) is deducible from \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) with respect to\n\\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\) then \\(M\\) is also deducible from \\(A, B, C,\n\\ldots\\) relative to any sub-collection of \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\),\nprovided that \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are compatible relative to the\nsub-collection (\u00a7155, no. 19). \n\\(\\neg M\\) is deducible from A, a class of\ncompatible premises, iff A is incompatible with\nM (\u00a7155, nos. 14, 15).\nIf M is deducible from A, \\(X\\)\nas well as from A, \\(\\neg X\\), then\nM is deducible from A alone\n(\u00a7155, no. 17).\nIf all propositions deducible from the premises A\nare true, A is true (\u00a7155, no. 6).\n\n\nIf M is deducible from A, and\nX from M, R (both\nwith respect to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)), then X is\ndeducible from A, R with respect to\n\\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\) (\u00a7155, no. 24).\n \n\n\n(\u00a7224, no. 2) If the inference: \\( \\begin{array}{l} A, B, C,\nD, E, F, G, \\ldots \\\\ \\hline M, N, O\\\\ \\end{array} \\)\n\n\nis valid, then so is: \\( \\begin{array}{l} A, B, C, D, \\ldots\\\\\n\\hline \\text{If } E, F, G, \\text{ are true, then so are } M, N, O\n\\ldots\\\\ \\end{array} \\) \n\n6.4 Conditional probability\n\nAccording to Bolzano\u2019s definition, deducibility requires\ncompatibility. This gives rise to some complications, e.g.,\ndeducibility is not reflexive, and from the fact that \\(B\\) is\ndeducible from \\(A\\) with respect to \\(i, j, \\ldots\\) we can conclude\nthat not-\\(A\\) is deducible from not-\\(B\\) only if \\(B\\) is not\nuniversally valid with respect to \\(i, j, \\ldots.\\) But it also brings\nan important benefit, namely, it allows him to integrate a relation of\nrelative probability directly into his system. In TS, \u00a7\n161, he defines the conditional probability (or relative\nvalidity) of a proposition M(i) with respect\nto a class of premises or hypotheses\nA(i) with variables\ni, as the ratio of the number of cases in which all\nthe propositions of the class as well as\nM(i) are true to the number of cases in\nwhich the propositions A(i) are all\ntrue. In other words, it is the ratio of the number of true variants\nof A(i) and\nM(i) to the number of true variants of\nA(i). Bolzano\u2019s conditional\nprobability is objective, an sich. \n\nBecause for each objectual idea there are infinitely many other\nequivalent ones, we cannot determine relative probabilities simply by\ncounting variants. It could be done, however, if the class of\nsubstitutions were restricted as in the case of relative validity by\nonly allowing one idea among all those equivalent to a given one to be\nincluded in the class of substituends, provided that the resulting\nclasses were finite (Bolzano sets out a different proposal in\nTS, \u00a7161, no. 7).\n\nFor example, consider the premises [The number of eggs in the nest is\nbetween 1 and 10] and [The number of eggs in the nest is odd], along\nwith the conclusion [The number of eggs in the nest is prime], in\nwhich only the idea [the number of eggs in the nest] is considered\nvariable in each of the propositions. Of the admissible substitutions,\nfour make both premises true and, of those four, three make the\nconclusion true as well. Thus the degree of validity of the conclusion\nrelative to the premises and the specified variable is .75. We can\nalso think of this as a relation between the forms \u2018A is\nbetween 1 and 10\u2019, \u2018A is odd\u2019, and\n\u2018A is prime\u2019. \n\nOne can immediately see why the premises of a probable deduction must\nbe compatible: the probability of M(i)\nrelative to A(i) is defined only if the denominator\nof the fraction is not zero, which means that the premises\nA(i) are compatible. On the other\nhand, the number of ideas that make both\nA(i) and\nM(i) true cannot be greater than the number\nof ideas that make true M(i); as a\nconsequence, the conditional probability of\nM(i) cannot be greater than 1. It is equal\nto 1 when the number of ideas that make true both\nA(i) and\nM(i) is equal to the number of ideas that\nmake true A(i) alone, which means\nthat all substitutions of ideas that make true\nA(i) also make true\nM(i), i.e., if\nM(i) is deducible from\nA(i). In other words, if\nM(i) is deducible from\nA(i), its probability relative to\nA(i) is equal to 1, which means that\nthe probability equals certainty. The probability is zero if no ideas\nmake both A(i) and\nM(i) true, i.e., if\nA(i) and\nM(i) are incompatible. Incompatibility and\ncertainty are thus two extreme cases of probability with values of 0\nand 1.\n\nThough some details remain rough, this is still an extraordinary\nachievement. Bolzano\u2019s approach yields the first logical\ndefinition of probability. For the first time deductive logic and\ninductive logic are united in a global theory and the former appears\nas a limit case of the latter. It is possible that in his\nTractatus 5.15, Wittgenstein took over Bolzano\u2019s\ntreatment of probability, perhaps through the mediation of the 1st\nedition of the Philosophical Propedeutic of R. Zimmermann\n(1853). Carnap\u2019s regular confirmation functions, too, are\nstrongly reminiscent of Bolzano\u2019s approach.\n\nBolzano adds proofs of a number of standard theorems, and also defines\nsubjective probability and different important probabilistic notions\nsuch as the degree of confidence, the credibility of a witness, etc.\nHe gives the formula of the degree of credibility of an event reported\nby independent testimonies as a function of the number of witnesses,\nof the number of testimonies, and of the number of true and false\npropositions stated by each witness. All these concepts play an\nimportant role in the chapter \u201con the nature of historical\nknowledge, particularly concerning miracles\u201d in Bolzano\n1834.\n\nBoth the class-logical relations and the relations between\npropositions are constructed from the initial relation of\ncompatibility by adding specific conditions to previously defined\nrelations. Compatibility is thus the basic relation of Bolzano\u2019s\nextensional logic. It is embedded in the very foundations of his\nsystem and all other relations (with the exception of different cases\nof disjunction, TS II, \u00a7160), deducibility included, are\nspecial cases of it.\n6.5 Deducibility more closely considered\n\nWhen defining semantic notions such as joint satisfiability or logical\nconsequence, contemporary logicians generally work with formal\nlanguages, the specification of which involves a separation of logical\nand non-logical elements. Consequence and other semantic relations are\nthen defined in terms of the behaviour of formulas when arbitrary\nsemantic values of the appropriate kinds are assigned to all of the\nnon-logical parameters (usually including a tacit parameter for the\ndomain of quantification). On this view, consequence is a dyadic\nrelation between a set of premises and a conclusion or set of\nconclusions.\n\nBecause non-logical parameters are never held constant, many\ninferences can only be declared valid if they are interpreted as\nenthymematic, requiring supplementation in the form of\n\u201ctacit\u201d premises. For example, \\(e \\lt \\pi\\) cannot be\nsaid to follow from \\(e \\lt 3\\) and \\(3 \\lt \\pi\\) because there are\nmodels of \\(aRb\\) and \\(bRc\\) that are not models of \\(aRc\\). Adding\n\\(\\forall x \\forall y \\forall z ((Rxy \\wedge Ryz) \\rightarrow Rxz)\\)\nto the premises, however, we obtain a valid argument form.\n\nBy contrast, Bolzano\u2019s deducibility is a relation between\npropositions in themselves and variable ideas. It does not rely on a\nstrict classification of ideas as either logical or non-logical (as we\nsaw, Bolzano had doubts about whether such a line could be drawn).\nIndeed, it is not a notion of logical consequence at all, but rather a\nmore general notion of which logical consequence is a special case.\nDeducibility is a triadic relation involving collections of\npremises, conclusions, and variable ideas.\n\nThus, for example, [\\(e \\lt \\pi\\)] is deducible from [\\(e \\lt 3\\)] and\n[\\(3 \\lt \\pi\\)] with respect to the variable ideas [\\(e\\)], [3], and,\n[\\(\\pi\\)]. In agreement with contemporary logic, this conclusion is\nnot deducible from the premises if [\\(\\lt\\)] is added to the variable\nideas, but it is deducible with respect to those variables if we add\nthe allegedly tacit premise. An additional noteworthy feature of\nBolzano\u2019s approach is that the allegedly unstated premise is\nequivalent to the claim that a relation of deducibility holds with\nrespect to the ideas [\\(e\\)], [3], and, [\\(\\pi\\)] (George, 1983).\n\nThe individuation of arguments, on Bolzano\u2019s view, involves not\nonly a specification of premises and conclusions(s) but also of an\ninference. Usually, inferences embody repeatable patterns or forms.\nAnd we determine the form-matter distinction (and thus what the\ninference is) in each particular case by specifying which ideas are to\nbe considered variable:\n\n\nIn every inference there are variable ideas with respect to which the\ndeducibility of the conclusion from the premises is stated. \u2026\nthe matter of the inference consist[s] precisely in these variable\nideas, while the form consists in what is common to all inferences\nwhich differ merely with respect to their matter (TS,\n\u00a7254 [II.516\u20137]). \n\n\nLimiting our interpretations of arguments to the inferential forms\nafforded by formal languages in which there are only logical constants\nthus precludes us from representing the forms of many arguments, in\nmuch the same way that the design of the IBM 360 ruled out file names\nwith more than eight characters (cf. van Benthem, 2013).\n\nAs with analyticity, deducibility can obtain for all sorts of reasons,\nnecessary or contingent, logical or non-logical, known or unknown.\n[Not all birds fly], for instance, is deducible from [Some birds\ndon\u2019t fly] with respect to [birds] and [fly], and [Buddy is a\nbird] is deducible from [Buddy is a crow] with respect to [Buddy],\nwhile [Harry Truman wasn\u2019t a Buddhist] is also deducible from\n[Harry Truman was a 20th-century US president] with respect to [Harry\nTruman]. The last example shows that deducibility does not require\nthat the connection between premises and conclusion be necessary, nor\nthat it be knowable a priori (though, unsurprisingly, Bolzano\nheld that there are cases of deducibility that are necessary, some of\nwhich are also knowable a priori). There is thus a clean\nisolation of truth-preservation as a phenomenon of intrinsic logical\ninterest. \n\nIn some cases, a deduction contains idle elements. For example, in an\nargument of the form \u2018All \\(A\\) are \\(C\\), All \\(B\\) are \\(C\\),\nAll \\(C\\) are \\(D\\), therefore All \\(A\\) are \\(D\\)\u2019, the second\npremise can be omitted without destroying the relation of\ndeducibility. Similarly in an argument of the form \u2018Anything\nthat is either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is \\(C\\), All \\(C\\) are \\(D\\), therefore\nAll \\(A\\) are \\(D\\)\u2019, we could get by with a simpler premise of\nthe form \u2018Anything that is \\(A\\) is \\(C\\)\u2019 instead of the\nfirst premise. Seeing this, Bolzano sought a narrower notion that\nwould filter out redundant or trivial inferences.\n\nIn TS, \u00a7 155, no. 26, he introduces the concept of\nexact deducibility: \\(M\\) is exactly deducible from \\(A, B,\nC, \\ldots\\), we read there, just in case \\(M\\) is deducible from \\(A,\nB, C, \\ldots\\) but no relation of deducibility holds if any of the\npremises, or any of their parts, is omitted. A deduction that is not\nexact is called redundant. In the shorter version of his\nlogic (Bolzano 2004a: 54), the stipulation about omitting parts is\ndropped. This was probably wise, as the additional condition seems to\nhave some unwelcome consequences (cf. Rusnock and\n\u0160ebest\u00edk, 2019, 312\u20133).\n\nBolzano proves some significant theorems about the narrower relation: If\n\\(M\\) is exactly deducible from \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\), then none \\(A, B,\nC, \\ldots, M\\) is universally valid or universally invalid with\nrespect to the variables of the deduction. Furthermore, the negation\nof each premise is compatible with the remaining premises. Hence,\nsince compatibility is required for deducibility, each premise is\nindependent of the others with respect to the variables of the\ndeduction. In addition, it follows from a result proved by Rolf George\nthat when a relation of exact deducibility holds, at least one of the\nvariables must occur both within the premises and within the\nconclusion (George, 1983; cf. Rusnock and \u0160ebest\u00edk,\n2019, 314\u20135). Exact deducibility thus satisfies a condition of\nrelevance (Stelzner, 2002).\n\nAnother special case of deducibility is logical deducibility;\nit holds when all the invariable elements in a deduction are logical\nconcepts (TS, \u00a7 223). There are obvious parallels\nbetween this notion and Tarski\u2019s notion of logical consequence.\nMore intriguing, perhaps, are the similarities between Bolzano\u2019s\nlogical deducibility and a relation described by Frege in the course\nof his dispute with Hilbert and Korselt (Frege, 1906, 426ff), which\nare so striking that G\u00f6ran Sundholm suggested that Frege may have\nprofited from an unacknowledged acquaintance with Bolzano\u2019s\nlogic (Sundholm, 2000; but cf. K\u00fcnne, 2008, 330ff.). Another\nplausible explanation is that Frege simply reverse-engineered\nsomething quite like Bolzanian logical deducibility by making the\nlogical methodology of Hilbert\u2019s Foundations of\nGeometry explicit.\n\nBolzano\u2019s characterization of logical deducibility is\nsubstitutional, an approach examined only to be rejected by Tarski\nbecause it was liable to produce unsatisfactory results in cases where\n\u201cthe language we are dealing with does not possess a sufficient\nstock of extra-logical constants\u201d (Tarski 1936 [1983]: 415).\nBolzano did not face exactly the same problem, because his logic deals\nwith ideas in themselves and not with linguistic expressions. The\nstructural problem underlying Tarski\u2019s criticism also did not\noccur to him because he assumed that for every object there is an idea\nin itself that represents it exclusively, a thesis that is not\nconsistently tenable with his other free-wheeling ontological\nassumptions (the difficulties are discussed in detail by Simons (1987:\n42) and Siebel (1996: 216\u2013223)). Tarski, who did not make\nBolzano\u2019s assumption with respect to languages, stated his\ndefinitive formulation in terms of models, or the satisfaction of\nsentential functions by sequences of objects.\n7. The objective connection among truths: grounding (Abfolge)\n\nThe Contributions of 1810 already contain speculation about\nan \u201cobjective connection among truths\u201d that is supposed to\nguide the organization and presentation of scientific knowledge.\nBolzano\u2019s discussion of this notion in the TS\nrepresents the last stage of his development of formal logic and is at\nthe same time the first modern study of axiomatic systems (\u00a7162,\n168 198\u2013222, 378; see also Bolzano 2004a, \u00a713, 14, 17, and\nthe other Bolzanian texts translated in Roski and Schnieder, 2022)\n.\n\nBolzano\u2019s idea of an objective order among truths has its origin\nin the Aristotelian distinction between proofs of the fact\nand those that yield the reason of the fact. His problem is\nthat of determining what should count as a proof of the second kind,\nthe sort that he calls an objective grounding of a truth.\nPreliminary to this inquiry is one in which he tries to characterize\nthe individual steps of such proofs in terms of the relation of\nground to consequence, which he calls Abfolge (also\ntranslated as \u2018grounding\u2019).\n\nFinding no satisfactory definition of grounding in the works of others\nand declaring himself unable to define the concept of grounding (or\nrather of a ground), he says that he is inclined to regard it as\nsimple (\u00a7202). In accordance with his methodology, he tries to at\nleast partially characterize the notion by stating a number of theses\nabout it that he considers to be true. To begin with, he claims that\nonly true propositions stand in the relation of ground to consequence.\nPerhaps unwisely, he assumes uniqueness: \u201cthere is only one\nobjective ground [for a given truth]\u201d (TS IV:\n\u00a7528; cf. \u00a7206). In many cases, the ground consists of a\ncollection of truths. The parts (members) of this collection are\ncalled partial grounds, the collection the complete or total ground.\nSimilarly, Bolzano distinguishes between the total and merely partial\nconsequences of a given ground. In modern terms, we would take the\nrelation he describes to be one that holds between two sets, an option\nnot open to Bolzano because, on his understanding, a collection must\ncontain at least two parts.\n\nGrounding is anti-transitive: If \\(\\Gamma\\) is the ground of\n\\(\\Delta\\) and \\(\\Delta\\) in turn the ground of \\(E\\), then \\(\\Gamma\\)\nis not the ground of \\(E\\), though we can speak of supporting\ntruths or, improperly, of remote grounds in such cases.\nGrounding is also anti-symmetrical and anti-reflexive. It should not\nbe confused with either deducibility or causality. Not with the former\nbecause deducibility holds among false as well as true propositions,\nis reflexive (for propositions that are not universally invalid wrt to\nthe variables of deduction), merely asymmetrical, and merely\nintransitive (being transitive, notably, in cases where the variables\nare the same). Nor with the latter, because the causal relation holds\nbetween actual objects, while grounding relates non-actual objects,\nnamely, true propositions in themselves. Causality and grounding are\nnonetheless connected, Bolzano thinks, taking claims of the form\n\u2018A causes B\u2019 to be analyzable as follows: \u2018[A\nexists] (partially) grounds [B exists]\u2019 (TS,\n\u00a7168).\n\nAlthough grounding is not a species of deducibility, Bolzano thinks\nthat there are cases in which a truth is both deducible from, and\ngrounded in, other truths. In some cases of this kind, he thinks, a\nrelation of ground to consequence also holds among the variants of the\noriginal propositions, provided only that the resulting propositions\nare all true. He speaks of formal grounding in such cases\n(TS,\u00a7162). Later, he cites the following example:\n[Socrates was an Athenian and a philosopher] is both grounded in and\ndeducible from [Socrates was an Athenian] and [Socrates was a\nphilosopher] (wrt [Socrates], [Athenian], and [philosopher]), and the\nsame holds, he clearly thinks, for all variants consisting of true\npropositions, e.g., [Nixon was a Republican and a crook], [Nixon was a\nRepublican], [Nixon was a crook] (TS, \u00a7199; cf.\n\u00a7221, no.7; and, for another example of formal grounding, see\n\u00a7226, no.5).\n\nBolzano maintains that there are truths that have no grounds, citing\nthe example [There is something]=[[Something] has objectuality]\n(TS, \u00a7 214). He calls them basic truths\n(Grundwahrheiten). He thinks that there must be more than one\nbasic truth, \u201cfor I cannot understand how from a single truth\nall others would follow either as consequences, or consequences of\nconsequences, etc.\u201d (\u00a7215). As in the\nContributions, Bolzano emphasizes that this is not an\nepistemic notion: in particular, basic truths need not be evident, and\nmay require proof in the sense of a certification.\n\nAssociated with each non-basic truth is a structured collection of\nsupporting truths (grounds, grounds of grounds, and so on). Bolzano\ndepicts such collections as trees (TS, \u00a7220). In some\ncases, dependence relations proceed ad infinitum , e.g., the\ngrounds of a truth describing a contingent state of a created\nsubstance (TS, \u00a7216). In others, the branches terminate\nin basic truths.\n\nBolzano\u2019s discussion in Volume 2 of TS ends with a few\nconjectures bearing especially on formal grounding relations among\npurely conceptual truths like those of mathematics (TS,\n\u00a7221). To begin with, he maintains that the grounds of non-basic\npurely conceptual truths always lie in other purely conceptual truths.\nWhen the consequence is deducible from the ground, there are no\nredundant premises (a condition satisfied, as we saw above, in cases\nof exact deducibility). In addition, the individual truths supporting\na purely conceptual truth are never more complex than it is. Each is,\nmoreover, the simplest among all propositions equivalent to it.\n(Bolzano uses these claims to argue that the grounding trees for\npurely conceptual truths are always finite.) They are also the most\ngeneral propositions from which the truth can be deduced.\n\nCombining these criteria, he proposed the following as a sufficient\ncondition for formal grounding: If the truth \\(M\\) is exactly\ndeducible from truths \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) with respect to \\(i, j,\n\\ldots\\), and \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are the simplest of all propositions\nequivalent to them (presumably again wrt \\(i, j, \\ldots\\)), and if\nnone of \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) is more complex than \\(M\\), then a\nrelation of formal grounding holds between \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) and\n\\(M\\) (\u00a7221, no.7).\n\nWhen these conditions are met systematically in the ordering of truths\nbelonging to a purely conceptual science, he conjectures further,\ndeductive efficiency is also maximized (\u00a7221, no. 3). Indeed, at\nthe end of \u00a7221, he entertains the thought that grounding might\nbe defined in terms of deductive efficiency:\n\n\nI occasionally doubt whether the concept of ground and consequence,\nwhich I have above claimed to be simple, is not complex after all; it\nmay turn out to be none other than the concept of an ordering of\ntruths which allows us to deduce from the smallest number of simple\npremises the largest possible number of the remaining truths as\nconclusions. (TS, \u00a7221, 388 note) \n\n\nRoski (2014: 370) sums up the general tendency of Bolzano\u2019s\nreflections as follows:\n\n\n[They are] partial answers to the question under what conditions a\ndeductive argument is explanatory [\u2026] On what I took to be the\nmost charitable reading of them, Bolzano\u2019s principles\nessentially boil down to the claim that a logically valid argument is\nexplanatory, only if there is no argument with fewer\npremises, for none of the premises is there a logically equivalent\nproposition that is simpler, and none of the premises is more complex\nthan the conclusion.[\u2026] These principles, I have maintained,\ncan be considered to be an explication of the idea that every premise\nand every concept in an explanatory argument is deductively relevant.\nMore importantly, they can be considered to be an explication of the\nidea that explanation ought to go in hand with some kind of\ntheoretical economy.\n\n\nCommentators have drawn attention to a number of shortcomings of\nBolzano\u2019s proposals (see, e.g., Mancosu, 1999, Rumberg, 2013,\nRoski, 2017). This would not have surprised him, since he was himself\naware that the above criteria could generate conflicts (see, e.g.,\n2004a, \u00a717), and had frankly admitted that his remarks about\ngrounding were tentative and incomplete, merely a first attempt to\ncircumscribe the concept:\n\n\nAlmost everything I advance in this part is tinged with uncertainty,\non many topics I have not reached any decision, and at best my\ninquiries are only fragments and suggestions which will have attained\ntheir goal if they provide others with the stimulus to reflect further\non these matters\u201d (TS II: \u00a7195, 327\u20138).\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nBolzano\u2019s TS, especially the Theory of Elements, is a\nturning point not only in logic, but also in epistemology. According\nto Cavaill\u00e8s (2008: 35),\n\n\nfor the first time perhaps, science is not considered as only\nmediating between the human mind and being in itself, dependent on\nboth and having no proper reality, but as an object sui\ngeneris, original in its essence, autonomous in its movement.\n\n\nScience is defined by its structure \u201cwhich not only is\ndemonstration, but which merges together with demonstration\u201d\n(ibid., 39). Stressing the fundamental role of demonstrations\nin scientific knowledge, Bolzano presented a viable alternative to\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics based on constructions in pure\nintuition.\n\n\nA truly scientific proof should ground the theorem, i.e.,\nintegrate it into a scientific theory organised according to the\n\u201cobjective connection of truths\u201d, starting with axioms and\nfundamental concepts.[\u2026]. These ideas indicate the direction of\nfuture research: the notion of normal proofs in the sense of Gentzen,\nproof trees, K\u00f6nig\u2019s lemma (\u0160ebest\u00edk 1992:\n478).\n\n\nWhile at least some of Bolzano\u2019s mathematical work was influential\nduring the nineteenth century, his logic met mostly with indifference\nand incomprehension. It was only towards the end of the century that\nphilosophers, notably Kerry, Twardowski, Meinong, and Husserl, began\nto appreciate his achievements. Curiously, Frege, whose ideas were\noften so close to those of Bolzano and who in his time was one of the\nfew logicians capable of understanding him, never mentions him in any\nof his publications or surviving papers. He was confronted with\nBolzano\u2019s ideas at least three times: in one of Kerry\u2019s\narticles, in correspondence with Husserl, and later in the controversy\nwith Korselt. We know of no evidence that he ever reacted to their\nallusions, and it is quite possible that he never laid hands on any of\nBolzano\u2019s works. Another interesting coincidence was noted by\nMancosu (1996, 110\u2013117 and note 69, p. 234): in \u00a7530 of\nTS, Bolzano argues that every indirect proof can be\ntransformed into a direct proof. Mancosu points out the striking\nsimilarity of this claim with one to the same effect presented by\nFrege in one of his posthumous writings (\u201cLogic in\nMathematics\u201d). In addition, Bolzano and Frege chose the very\nsame example (Euclid I.19) to illustrate their claims.\n\nAfter Twardowski (1894), it was chiefly Husserl who drew\nphilosophers\u2019 attention to Bolzano with his memorable words\nabout TS (1900 [1970], I: 222),\n\n\na work which, in its treatment of the logical \u2018theory of\nelements\u2019, far surpasses everything that the world-literature\nhas to offer in the way of a systematic sketch of logic. Bolzano did\nnot, of course, expressly discuss or support any independent\ndemarcation of pure logic in our sense, but he provided one de\nfacto in the first two volumes of his work, in his discussion of\nwhat underlay a Wissenschaftslehre or theory of science in\nthe sense of his conception; he did so with such purity and scientific\nstrictness, and with such a rich store of original, scientifically\nconfirmed and ever fruitful thoughts, that we must count him as one of\nthe greatest logicians of all time.\n\n\nNevertheless, he always insisted on the originality of his own\nphenomenological method. Between the two wars, Bolzano\u2019s logic\nand philosophy of mathematics inspired Heinrich Scholz and Jean\nCavaill\u00e8s. Also during this period, Tarski discovered the\nconcept of logical consequence independently of Bolzano, only becoming\naware of the affinity between his work and Bolzano\u2019s after\nScholz (1937 [1961]) pointed it out. However, already in Twardowski\n(1894), the founder of the Polish Lvov-Warsaw school, Bolzano\u2019s\nideas were discussed and criticized at length, and some of them might\nhave become common lore in the Polish school. In 1920, Hans Hahn\nedited the Paradoxes of the infinite with important critical\nnotes, comparing Bolzano with Cantor. Karl Menger might have taken\ninspiration for his theory of dimension not only from Poincar\u00e9,\nbut also from the Paradoxes. Neurath praised Bolzano as one\nof the ancestors of the Vienna Circle, because of the conciseness of\nhis style and the rejection of Kant\u2019s philosophy. Some important\nBolzanian ideas are also found in the work of Quine. All these\ncurrents are indebted to Bolzano for the lesson of intellectual rigour\nand of analytic power. It is Bolzano who is the true founder of the\nkind of analytical philosophy whose core is logic and which is\nimpregnated with science. His logic has archaic aspects, but he\nintroduced not only new concepts, methods and theories, new themes and\nnew problems, but above all a new spirit that has animated philosophy\never since.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1810, <em>Beytr\u00e4ge zu einer begr\u00fcndeteren Darstellung\nder Mathematik</em> (<em>Contributions to a better grounded\npresentation of mathematics</em>), Prague (English transl.
