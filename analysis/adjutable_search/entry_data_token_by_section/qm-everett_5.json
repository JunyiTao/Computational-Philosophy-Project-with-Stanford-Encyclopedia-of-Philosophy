    "main_text": "Empirical Faithfulness\n4. Empirical Faithfulness\n\nWhen the physicist Bryce DeWitt read Everett\u2019s description of\npure wave mechanics in the long version of his PhD thesis, DeWitt\nobjected on the grounds that the surplus structure of the theory made\nit too rich to represent the world we experience. In his 7 May 1957\nletter to Everett\u2019s advisor John Wheeler, DeWitt wrote\n\nI do agree that the scheme which Everett sets up is beautifully\nconsistent; that any single one of the [relative memory states of an\nobserver] \u2026 gives an excellent representation of a typical memory\nconfiguration, with no causal or logical contradictions, and with\n\u201cbuilt-in\u201d statistical features. The whole state vector\n\u2026, however, is simply too rich in content, by vast orders of\nmagnitude, to serve as a representation of the physical world. It\ncontains all possible branches in it at the same time. In the real\nphysical world we must be content with just one branch.\nEverett\u2019s world and the real physical world are therefore not\nisomorphic. (Barrett and Byrne 2012, 246\u20137)\n\n\nThe worry was that the richness of pure wave mechanics indicated an\nempirical flaw in the theory because we do not notice other branches.\nAs DeWitt put it:\n\nThe trajectory of the memory configuration of a real observer \u2026\ndoes not branch. I can testify to this from personal\nintrospection, as can you. I simply do not branch. (Barrett\nand Byrne 2012, 246)\n\n\nWheeler showed Everett the letter and told him to reply. In his 31 May\n1957 letter to DeWitt, Everett began by summarizing his understanding\nof the proper cognitive status of physical theories:\n\nFirst, I must say a few words to clarify my conception of the nature\nand purpose of physical theories in general. To me, any physical\ntheory is a logical construct (model), consisting of symbols and rules\nfor their manipulation, some of whose elements are\nassociated with elements of the perceived world. If this association\nis an isomorphism (or at least a homomorphism) we can speak of the\ntheory as correct, or as faithful. The fundamental\nrequirements of any theory are logical consistency and correctness in\nthis sense. Barrett and Byrne (2012, 253)\n\n\nIn a subsequent version of the long thesis, Everett further explained\nthat \u201c[t]he word homomorphism would be technically more\ncorrect, since there may not be a one-one correspondence between the\nmodel and the external world\u201d (1956, 169). The map is a\nhomomorphism because (1) there may be elements of the theory that do\nnot directly correspond to experience and because (2) a particular\ntheory may not seek to explain all of experience. As indicated by the\nitalicized some in the quotation above, the first point is\nparticularly important in the case of pure wave mechanics.\nSpecifically, that the relative records on the vast majority of\nbranches of the absolute state do not correspond with our\nexperience did not worry Everett at all, even when these records\nrepresent empirical structure.\n\nEverett further described how he understood the aim of physical\ninquiry in his letter to DeWitt, \u201cThere can be no question of\nwhich theory is \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018real\u2019 \u2014 the\nbest that one can do is reject those theories which are not\nisomorphic to sense experience\u201d Barrett and Byrne (2012, 253).\nIn all, Everett\u2019s position was in some ways strikingly similar\nto Bas van Fraassen\u2019s (1980) later constructive empiricism\nexcept that most of the empirical structure of pure wave mechanics is\nirrelevant to one\u2019s actual experience. See Barrett (2011a) for\nan extended discussion of Everett\u2019s notion of faithfulness.\n\nFor Everett, then, the relative-state formulation of pure wave\nmechanics is empirically faithful because there is a\nparticular sort of homomorphism between its model and the world as\nexperienced. Namely, it is because one can find a modeled\nobserver\u2019s experience in a typical relative sequence of\nher physical records. But the sense in which he finds finds an\nobserver\u2019s experience in his model of pure wave mechanics is\nsuch that it makes it difficult to judge the theory as empirically\nadequate over quantum probabilities. We will review four distinct\nfeatures of empirical faithfulness which Everett argued for then\nreturn to the question of empirical adequacy.\n",
