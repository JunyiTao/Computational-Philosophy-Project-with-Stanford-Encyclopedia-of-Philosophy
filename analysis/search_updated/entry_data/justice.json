    "preamble": "\n\nThe idea of justice occupies centre stage both in ethics, and in legal\nand political philosophy. We apply it to individual actions, to laws,\nand to public policies, and we think in each case that if they are\nunjust this is a strong, maybe even conclusive, reason to reject them.\nClassically, justice was counted as one of the four cardinal virtues\n(and sometimes as the most important of the four); in modern times\nJohn Rawls famously described it as \u2018the first virtue of social\ninstitutions\u2019 (Rawls 1971, p.3; Rawls, 1999, p.3). We might\ndebate which of these realms of practical philosophy has first claim\non justice: is it first and foremost a property of the law, for\nexample, and only derivatively a property of individuals and other\ninstitutions? But it is probably more enlightening to accept that the\nidea has over time sunk deep roots in each of these domains, and to\ntry to make sense of such a wide-ranging concept by identifying\nelements that are present whenever justice is invoked, but also\nexamining the different forms it takes in various practical contexts.\nThis article aims to provide a general map of the ways in which\njustice has been understood by philosophers, past and present.\n\nWe begin by identifying four core features that distinguish justice\nfrom other moral and political ideas. We then examine some major\nconceptual contrasts: between conservative and ideal justice, between\ncorrective and distributive justice, between procedural and\nsubstantive justice, and between comparative and non-comparative\njustice. Next we turn to questions of scope: to who or what do\nprinciples of justice apply? We ask whether non-human animals can be\nsubjects of justice, whether justice applies only between people who\nalready stand in a particular kind of relationship to one another, and\nwhether individual people continue to have duties of justice once\njustice-based institutions have been created. We then examine three\noverarching theories that might serve to unify the different forms of\njustice: utilitarianism, contractarianism, and egalitarianism. But it\nseems, in conclusion, that no such theory is likely be successful.\n\nMore detailed discussions of particular forms of justice can be found\nin other entries: see especially\n distributive justice,\n global justice,\n intergenerational justice,\n international distributive justice,\n justice and bad luck,\n justice as a virtue, and\n retributive justice.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Justice: Mapping the Concept\n\n\u2018Justice\u2019 has sometimes been used in a way that makes it\nvirtually indistinguishable from rightness in general. Aristotle, for\nexample, distinguished between \u2018universal\u2019 justice that\ncorresponded to \u2018virtue as a whole\u2019 and\n\u2018particular\u2019 justice which had a narrower scope\n(Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, chs. 1\u20132). The\nwide sense may have been more evident in classical Greek than in\nmodern English. But Aristotle also noted that when justice was\nidentified with \u2018complete virtue\u2019, this was always\n\u2018in relation to another person\u2019. In other words, if\njustice is to be identified with morality as such, it must be morality\nin the sense of \u2018what we owe to each other\u2019 (see Scanlon\n1998). But it is anyway questionable whether justice should be\nunderstood so widely. At the level of individual ethics, justice is\noften contrasted with charity on the one hand, and mercy on the other,\nand these too are other-regarding virtues. At the level of public\npolicy, reasons of justice are distinct from, and often compete with,\nreasons of other kinds, for example economic efficiency or\nenvironmental value.\n\nAs this article will endeavour to show, justice takes on different\nmeanings in different practical contexts, and to understand it fully\nwe have to grapple with this diversity. But it is nevertheless worth\nasking whether we find a core concept that runs through all these\nvarious uses, or whether it is better regarded as a family resemblance\nidea according to which different combinations of features are\nexpected to appear on each occasion of use. The most plausible\ncandidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of\nJustinian, a codification of Roman Law from the sixth century AD,\nwhere justice is defined as \u2018the constant and perpetual will to\nrender to each his due\u2019. This is of course quite abstract until\nfurther specified, but it does throw light upon four important aspects\nof justice.\n1.1 Justice and Individual Claims\n\nFirst, it shows that justice has to do with how individual people are\ntreated (\u2018to each his due\u2019). Issues of justice\narise in circumstances in which people can advance claims \u2013 to\nfreedom, opportunities, resources, and so forth \u2013 that are\npotentially conflicting, and we appeal to justice to resolve such\nconflicts by determining what each person is properly entitled to\nhave. In contrast, where people\u2019s interests converge, and the\ndecision to be taken is about the best way to pursue some common\npurpose \u2013 think of a government official having to decide how\nmuch food to stockpile as insurance against some future emergency\n\u2013 justice gives way to other values. In other cases, there may\nbe no reason to appeal to justice because resources are so plentiful\nthat we do not need to worry about allotting shares to individuals.\nHume pointed out that in a hypothetical state of abundance where\n\u2018every individual finds himself fully provided with whatever his\nmost voracious appetites can want\u2019, \u2018the cautious, jealous\nvirtue of justice would never once have been dreamed of\u2019 (Hume,\nAn Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals, pp.\n183\u20134). Hume also believed \u2013 and philosophical controversy\non this point persists until today \u2013 that justice has no\nplace in close personal relationships, such as the family, where (it\nis alleged) each identifies with the others\u2019 interests so\nstrongly that there is no need and no reason for anyone to make claims\nof personal entitlement. (See Sandel 1982 for a defence of this view;\nfor a critique, see Okin 1989. See also the entry on\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family).\n\nThat justice is a matter of how each separate person is treated\nappears to create problems for theories such as utilitarianism that\njudge actions and policies on the basis of their overall consequences\naggregated across people \u2013 assuming that these theories wish to\nincorporate rather than discard the idea of justice. In Section 4\nbelow we examine how utilitarians have attempted to respond to this\nchallenge.\n\nAlthough justice is centrally a matter of how individuals are treated,\nit is also possible to speak of justice for groups \u2013 for example\nwhen the state is allocating resources between different categories of\ncitizens. Here each group is being treated as though it were a\nseparate individual for purposes of the allocation.\n1.2 Justice, Charity and Enforceable Obligation\n\nSecond, Justinian\u2019s definition underlines that just treatment is\nsomething due to each person, in other words that justice is\na matter of claims that can be rightfully made against the agent\ndispensing justice, whether a person or an institution. Here there is\na contrast with other virtues: we demand justice, but we beg for\ncharity or forgiveness. This also means that justice is a matter of\nobligation for the agent dispensing it, and that the agent wrongs the\nrecipient if the latter is denied what is due to her. It is a\ncharacteristic mark of justice that the obligations it creates should\nbe enforceable: we can be made to deliver what is due to\nothers as a matter of justice, either by the recipients themselves or\nby third parties. However it overstates the position to make the\nenforceability of its requirements a defining feature of justice (see\nBuchanan 1987). On the one hand, there are some claims of justice that\nseem not to be enforceable (by anyone). When we dispense gifts to our\nchildren or our friends, we ought to treat each recipient fairly, but\nneither the beneficiaries themselves nor anyone else can rightfully\nforce the giver to do so. On the other hand, in cases of extreme\nemergency, it may sometimes be justifiable to force people to do more\nthan justice requires them to do \u2013 there may exist enforceable\nduties of humanity. But these are rare exceptions. The obligatory\nnature of justice generally goes hand-in-hand with enforceability.\n1.3 Justice and Impartiality\n\nThe third aspect of justice to which Justinian\u2019s definition\ndraws our attention is the connection between justice and the\nimpartial and consistent application of rules \u2013 that is what the\n\u2018constant and perpetual will\u2019 part of the definition\nconveys. Justice is the opposite of arbitrariness. It requires that\nwhere two cases are relevantly alike, they should be treated in the\nsame way (We discuss below the special case of justice and lotteries).\nFollowing a rule that specifies what is due to a person who has\nfeatures X, Y, Z whenever such a person is\nencountered ensures this. And although the rule need not be\nunchangeable \u2013 perpetual in the literal sense \u2013 it must be\nrelatively stable. This explains why justice is exemplified in the\nrule of law, where laws are understood as general rules impartially\napplied over time. Outside of the law itself, individuals and\ninstitutions that want to behave justly must mimic the law in certain\nways (for instance, gathering reliable information about individual\nclaimants, allowing for appeals against decisions).\n1.4 Justice and Agency\n\nFinally, the definition reminds us that justice requires an agent\nwhose will alters the circumstances of its objects. The agent might be\nan individual person, or it might be a group of people, or an\ninstitution such as the state. So we cannot, except metaphorically,\ndescribe as unjust states of affairs that no agent has contributed to\nbringing about \u2013 unless we think that there is a Divine Being\nwho has ordered the universe in such a way that every outcome is a\nmanifestation of His will. Admittedly we are tempted to make\njudgements of what is sometimes called \u2018cosmic injustice\u2019\n\u2013 say when a talented person\u2019s life is cut cruelly short\nby cancer, or our favourite football team is eliminated from the\ncompetition by a freak goal \u2013 but this is a temptation we should\nresist.\n\nThis agency condition, however, is less restrictive than it might at\nfirst appear. It by no means excludes the possibility that agents can\ncreate injustice by omission \u2013 for example by failing to create\nthe institutions or to enact the policies that would deliver vital\nresources to those who need them. Thus it is now common to speak of\n\u2018systemic injustice\u2019 in the case of bad outcomes that\nno-one intends to occur but that could be prevented by a shift in\nsocial norms or institutional practices. The agents in these cases are\nall those who by acting together to change these things could invert\nthe injustice, but have so far failed to do so.\n2. Justice: Four Distinctions\n\nWe have so far looked at four elements that are present in every use\nof the concept of justice. Now it is time to consider some equally\nimportant contrasts.\n2.1 Conservative versus Ideal Justice\n\nPhilosophers writing on justice have observed that it has two\ndifferent faces, one conservative of existing norms and practices, the\nother demanding reform of these norms and practices (see Sidgwick\n1874/1907, Raphael 2001). Thus on the one hand it is a matter of\njustice to respect people\u2019s rights under existing law or moral\nrules, or more generally to fulfil the legitimate expectations they\nhave acquired as a result of past practice, social conventions, and so\nforth; on the other hand, justice often gives us reason to change\nlaws, practices and conventions quite radically, thereby creating new\nentitlements and expectations. This exposes an ambiguity in what it\nmeans to \u2018render each his due\u2019. What is \u2018due\u2019\nmight be what a person can reasonably expect to have given existing\nlaw, policy, or social practice, or it might be what the person should\nget under a regime of ideal justice: this could mean what the person\ndeserves, or needs, or is entitled to on grounds of equality,\ndepending on which ideal principle is being invoked.\n\nConceptions of justice vary according to the weight they attach to\neach of these faces. At one extreme, some conceptions interpret\njustice as wholly concerned with what individuals can claim under\nexisting laws and social conventions: thus for Hume, justice was to be\nunderstood as adherence to a set of rules that assign physical objects\nto individuals (such as being the first possessor of such an object)\n(Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, Book III, Part II). These\nrules can be explained by reference to the natural associations that\nform in people\u2019s minds between persons and external objects, and\nalthough the system of justice as a whole can be shown to be socially\nuseful, there are no relevant independent standards by which its\nprinciples can be assessed (Hume briskly dismissed equality\nand merit as principles for allocating property to persons).\nIn similar vein, Hayek argued that justice was a property of\nindividual behaviour, understood as compliance with the \u2018rules\nof just conduct\u2019 that had evolved to enable a market economy to\nfunction effectively. For Hayek, to speak of \u2018social\njustice\u2019 as an ideal standard of distribution was as meaningless\nas to speak of a \u2018moral stone\u2019 (Hayek 1976, p. 78)\n\nAt the other extreme stand conceptions of justice which posit some\nideal principle of distribution such as equality, together with a\n\u2018currency\u2019 specifying the respect in which justice\nrequires people to be made equally well off, and then refuse to\nacknowledge the justice of any claims that do not arise directly from\nthe application of this principle. Thus claims deriving from existing\nlaw or practice are dismissed unless they happen to coincide with what\nthe principle requires. More often, however, ideal justice is seen as\nproposing principles by which existing institutions and practices can\nbe assessed, with a view to reforming them, or in the extreme case\nabolishing them entirely, while the claims that people already have\nunder those practices are given some weight. Rawls, for example, whose\ntwo principles of justice count as ideal principles for this purpose,\nis at pains to stress that they are not intended to be applied in a\nway that disregards people\u2019s existing legitimate expectations.\nAbout the \u2018difference principle\u2019, which requires social\nand economic inequalities to be regulated so that they work to the\ngreatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society, he\nsays:\n\nIt applies to the announced system of public law and statutes and not\nto particular transactions or distributions, nor to the decisions of\nindividuals and associations, but rather to the institutional\nbackground against which these transactions and decisions take place.\nThere are no unannounced and unpredictable interferences with\ncitizens\u2019 expectations and acquisitions. Entitlements are earned\nand honored as the public system of rules declares. (Rawls 1993, p.\n283)\n\nHere we see Rawls attempting to reconcile the demands of conservative\nand ideal justice. Yet he does not directly address the question of\nwhat should happen when changing circumstances mean that the\ndifference principle requires new laws or policies to be enacted: do\nthose whose prior entitlements or expectations are no longer met have\na claim to be compensated for their loss? We could call this the\nquestion of transitional justice (though this phrase is often used now\nin a more specific sense to refer to the process of reconciliation\nthat may occur following civil war or other armed conflicts: see the\nentry on\n transitional justice).\n2.2 Corrective versus Distributive Justice\n\nA second important contrast, whose pedigree reaches back at least as\nfar as Aristotle, is between justice as a principle for assigning\ndistributable goods of various kinds to individual people, and justice\nas a remedial principle that applies when one person wrongly\ninterferes with another\u2019s legitimate holdings. Thus suppose Bill\nsteals Alice\u2019s computer, or sells Alice faulty goods which he\nclaims to be in perfect order: then Alice suffers a loss, which\njustice demands that Bill should remedy by returning the computer or\nfulfilling his contract honestly. Corrective justice, then,\nessentially concerns a bilateral relationship between a wrongdoer and\nhis victim, and demands that the fault be cancelled by restoring the\nvictim to the position she would have been in had the wrongful\nbehaviour not occurred; it may also require that the wrongdoer not\nbenefit from his faulty behaviour. Distributive justice, on the other\nhand, is multilateral: it assumes a distributing agent, and a number\nof persons who have claims on what is being distributed. Justice here\nrequires that the resources available to the distributor be shared\naccording to some relevant criterion, such as equality, desert, or\nneed. In Aristotle\u2019s example, if there are fewer flutes\navailable than people who want to play them, they should be given to\nthe best performers (Aristotle, The Politics, p. 128). In\nmodern debates, principles of distributive justice are applied to\nsocial institutions such as property and tax systems, which are\nunderstood as producing distributive outcomes across large societies,\nor even the world as a whole.\n\nThe conceptual distinction between distributive and corrective justice\nseems clear, but their normative relationship is more difficult to pin\ndown (see Perry 2000, Ripstein 2004, Coleman 1992, chs. 16\u201317).\nSome have claimed that corrective justice is merely instrumental to\ndistributive justice: its aim is to move from a situation of\ndistributive injustice brought about by the faulty behaviour to one\nthat is more nearly (if not perfectly) distributively just. But this\nview runs into a number of objections. One is that so long as Alice\nhas a legitimate title to her computer, her claim of corrective\njustice against Bill does not depend on her having had, prior to the\ntheft, the share of resources that distributive justice ideally\ndemands. She might be richer than she deserves to be, yet corrective\njustice still require that the computer be returned to her. In other\nwords, corrective justice may serve to promote conservative rather\nthan ideal justice, to use the distinction introduced in 2.1. Another\nobjection is that corrective justice requires the wrongdoer himself to\nrestore or compensate the person he has wronged, even if the cause of\ndistributive justice could be better served by transferring resources\nfrom a third party \u2013 giving Alice one of\neven-more-undeservedly-rich Charles\u2019s computers, for example.\nThis underlines the bilateral nature of corrective justice, and also\nthe fact that it comes into play in response to faulty behaviour on\nsomeone\u2019s part. Its primary demand is that people should not\nlose out because others have behaved wrongfully or carelessly, but it\nalso encompasses the idea that \u2018no man should profit by his own\nwrong\u2019. If Alice loses her computer in a boating accident, she\nmight, under an insurance scheme, have a claim of\ndistributive justice to a new machine, but she has no claim\nof corrective justice.\n\nIf corrective justice cannot be subsumed normatively under\ndistributive justice, we need to explain its value. What is achieved\nwhen we make Bill return the computer to Alice? Aristotle\n(Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, ch. 4) suggested that corrective\njustice aims to restore the two parties to a position of equality; by\nreturning the computer we cancel both Bill\u2019s unjustified gain\nand Alice\u2019s unjustified loss. But this assumes that the computer\ncan be returned intact. Corrective justice requires that Alice be made\nno worse off than she was before the theft, even if that means Bill\nsuffering an absolute loss (e.g. by paying for a new computer if he\nhas damaged Alice\u2019s). Aristotle himself recognized that the idea\nof evening out gain and loss made no literal sense in a case where one\nperson assaults another and has to compensate him for his injury\n\u2013 there is no \u2018gain\u2019 to be redistributed. It seems,\nthen, that the value of corrective justice must lie in the principle\nthat each person must take responsibility for his own conduct, and if\nhe fails to respect the legitimate interests of others by causing\ninjury, he must make good the harm. In that way, each person can plan\nher life secure in the knowledge that she will be protected against\ncertain kinds of external setbacks. Philosophers and lawyers writing\non corrective justice disagree about what standard of responsibility\nshould apply \u2013 for example whether compensation is required only\nwhen one person wilfully or negligently causes another to suffer loss,\nor whether it can also be demanded when the perpetrator displays no\nsuch fault but is nevertheless causally responsible for the\ninjury.\n2.3 Procedural versus Substantive Justice\n\nA third distinction that must be drawn is between the justice of the\nprocedures that might be used to determine how benefits and burdens of\nvarious kinds are allocated to people, and the justice of the final\nallocation itself. It might initially seem as though the justice of a\nprocedure can be reduced to the justice of the results produced by\napplying it, but this is not so. For one thing, there are cases in\nwhich the idea of an independently just outcome makes no sense. A coin\ntoss is a fair way of deciding who starts a game, but neither the\nBlues nor the Reds have a claim of justice to bat first or kick off.\nBut even where a procedure has been shaped by a concern that it should\nproduce substantively just outcomes, it may still have special\nproperties that make it intrinsically just. In that case, using a\ndifferent procedure to produce the same result might be objectionable.\nIn an influential discussion, John Rawls contrasted perfect\nprocedural justice, where a procedure is such that if it is\nfollowed a just outcome is guaranteed (requiring the person who cuts a\ncake to take the last slice himself is the illustration Rawls\nprovides), imperfect procedural justice, where the procedure\nis such that following it is likely, but not certain, to produce the\njust result, and pure procedural justice, such as the\ncoin-tossing example, where there is no independent way to assess the\noutcome \u2013 if we call it just, it is only on the grounds that it\nhas come about by following the relevant procedure (Rawls 1971, 1999,\n\u00a7 14).\n\nTheories of justice can then be distinguished according to the\nrelative weight they attach to procedures and substantive outcomes.\nSome theories are purely procedural in form. Robert Nozick\ndistinguished between historical theories of justice, end-state\ntheories, and patterned theories in order to defend the first against\nthe second and third (Nozick 1974). An end-state theory defines\njustice in terms of some overall property of a distribution (of\nresources, welfare, etc.) \u2013 for example whether it is\negalitarian, or whether the lowest position in the distribution is as\nhigh as it can be, as Rawls\u2019 difference principle requires. A\npatterned theory looks at whether what each receives as part of a\ndistribution matches some individual feature such as their desert or\ntheir need. By contrast, an historical theory asks about the process\nby which the final outcome has arisen. In Nozick\u2019s particular\ncase, a distribution of resources is said to be just if everyone\nwithin its scope is entitled to what they now own, having acquired it\nby legitimate means \u2013 such as voluntary contract or gift \u2013\nfrom someone who was also entitled to have it, leading back eventually\nto a just act of acquisition \u2013 such as labouring on a plot of\nland \u2013 that gave the first owner his valid title. The shape of\nthe final distribution is irrelevant: according to Nozick, justice is\nentirely a matter of the sequence of prior events that created it (for\ncritical assessments of Nozick\u2019s position, see Paul 1982, Wolff\n1991, Cohen 1995, chs. 1\u20132).\n\nFor most philosophers, however, the justice of a procedure is to a\nlarge extent a function of the justice of the outcomes that it tends\nto produce when applied. For instance, the procedures that together\nmake up a fair trial are justified on the grounds that for the most\npart they produce outcomes in which the guilty are punished and the\ninnocent are acquitted. Yet even in these cases, we should be wary of\nassuming that the procedure itself has no independent value. We can\nask of a procedure whether it treats the people to whom it is applied\njustly, for example by giving them adequate opportunities to advance\ntheir claims, not requiring them to provide personal information that\nthey find humiliating to reveal, and so forth. Studies by social\npsychologists have shown that in many cases people care more about\nbeing treated fairly by the institutions they have to deal with than\nabout how they fare when the procedure\u2019s final result is known\n(Lind and Tyler 1988).\n2.4 Comparative versus Non-Comparative Justice\n\nJustice takes a comparative form when to determine what is due to one\nperson we need to look at what others can also claim: to determine how\nlarge a slice of pie is rightfully John\u2019s, we have to know how\nmany others have a claim to the pie, and also what the principle for\nsharing it should be \u2013 equality, or something else. Justice\ntakes a non-comparative form when we can determine what is due to a\nperson merely by knowing relevant facts about that particular person:\nif John has already been promised the whole of the pie, then that is\nwhat he can rightfully claim for himself. Some theories of justice\nseem to imply that justice is always a comparative notion \u2013 for\nexample when it is said that justice consists in the absence of\narbitrary inequality \u2013 whereas others imply that it is always\nnon-comparative. But conceptually, at least, both forms seem\nadmissible; indeed we can find cases in which it appears we have to\nchoose between doing justice comparatively and doing it\nnon-comparatively (see Feinberg 1974; for a critical response, see\nMontague 1980). For example, we might have several candidates all of\nwhom are roughly equally deserving of an academic honour, but the\nnumber of honours we are permitted to award is smaller than the number\nof candidates. If we honour some but not others, we perpetrate a\ncomparative injustice, but if to avoid doing so we honour no-one at\nall, then each is treated less well than they deserve, and so unjustly\nfrom a non-comparative perspective.\n\nTheories of justice can then be categorised according to whether they\nare comparative, non-comparative, or neither. Principles of equality\n\u2013 principles requiring the equal distribution of some kind of\nbenefit \u2013 are plainly comparative in form, since what is due to\neach person is simply an equal share of the benefit in question rather\nthan any fixed amount. In the case of principles of desert, the\nposition is less straightforward. These principles take the form\n\u2018A deserves X by virtue of P\u2019, where\nX is a mode of treatment, and P is a personal\ncharacteristic possessed by A (Feinberg 1970). In the case of\nboth X and P, we can ask whether they are to be\nidentified comparatively or non-comparatively. Thus what A\ndeserves might either be an entitlement, or an absolute amount of some\nbenefit \u2013 \u2018a living wage\u2019, say \u2013 or it might\nbe a share of some collective benefit, or a multiple or\nfraction of what others are receiving \u2013 \u2018twice what\nB is getting\u2019, say. Turning to P, or what is often\ncalled the desert basis, this may be a feature of A that we can\nidentify without reference to anyone else, or it may be a comparative\nfeature, such as being the best student in a graduating class. So\ndesert-based claims of justice might take one of four different forms\ndepending on whether the basis of desert and/or the deserved mode of\ntreatment is comparative or non-comparative (see Olsaretti 2003 for\nessays that address this question; for a more advanced treatment, see\nKagan 2012, Part III).\n\nAmong principles of justice that are straightforwardly non-comparative\nare \u2018sufficiency\u2019 principles which hold that what justice\nrequires is that each person should have \u2018enough\u2019, on some\ndimension or other \u2013 for instance, have all of their needs\nfulfilled, or have a specified set of capabilities that they are able\nto exercise (for a general defence of sufficiency, though not one that\nlinks it specifically to justice, see Frankfurt 2015; for a critique,\nsee Casal 2007). Such principles, however, need to be supplemented by\nother principles, not only to tell us what to do with the surplus\n(assuming there is one) once everyone has sufficient resources, but\nalso to guide us in situations where there are too few resources to\nbring everyone up to the sufficiency threshold. Should we, for\nexample, maximise the number of people who achieve sufficiency, or\nminimise the aggregate shortfall suffered by those in the relevant\ngroup? Unless we are prepared to say that these are not matters of\njustice, a theory of justice that contains only the sufficiency\nprinciple and nothing else looks incomplete.\n\nSome theories of justice cannot readily be classified either as\ncomparative or as non-comparative. Consider one part of Rawls\u2019\ntheory of social justice, the difference principle, which as noted\nabove requires that social and economic inequalities be arranged to\nthe greatest benefit of the least advantaged (Rawls 1971, 1999,\n\u00a712\u201313). Under this principle, ideally just shares are\ncalculated by determining what each person would receive under the set\nof social institutions whose economic effect is to raise the worst off\nperson to the highest possible level. This is neither a fixed amount,\nnor one that depends in any direct sense on what other individuals are\nreceiving, or should receive. Applying the difference principle does\nrequire making comparisons, but these are comparisons between the\neffects of different social institutions \u2013 say different tax\nlaws, or different ways of defining property rights \u2013 not\nbetween individual people and the amounts of benefit they are\nreceiving. We might call theories of this kind \u2018holistic\u2019\nor \u2018systemic\u2019.\n3. The Scope of Justice\n\nWhen we raise questions about the scope of justice, we are asking\nabout when principles of justice take effect and among\nwhom. We have already, when discussing Hume, encountered the idea\nthat there might be circumstances in which justice becomes irrelevant\n\u2013 circumstances in which resources are so abundant that it is\npointless to allocate individual shares, or, as Hume also believed, in\nwhich resources are so scarce that everyone is permitted to grab what\nhe can in the name of self-preservation. But even in circumstances\nthat are less extreme than these, questions about scope arise. Who can\nmake claims of justice, and who might have the corresponding\nobligation to meet them? Does this depend on the kind of thing that is\nbeing claimed? If comparative principles are being applied, who should\nbe counted as part of the comparison group? Do some principles of\njustice have universal scope \u2013 they apply whenever agent\nA acts towards recipient B, regardless of the\nrelationship between them \u2013 while others are contextual in\ncharacter, applying only within social or political relationships of a\ncertain kind? The present section examines some of these questions in\ngreater detail.\n3.1 Human vs non-human animals\n\nWhat does a creature have to do, or be like, to be included within the\nscope of (at least some) principles of justice? Most past philosophers\nhave assumed that the line should be drawn so as to exclude all\nnon-human animals, but more recently some have been prepared to defend\n\u2018justice for animals\u2019 (Nussbaum 2006, ch. 6; Garner 2013).\nAgainst this, Rawls asserts that although we have \u2018duties of\ncompassion and humanity\u2019 towards animals and should refrain from\ntreating them cruelly, nonetheless they are \u2018outside the scope\nof the theory of justice\u2019 (Rawls 1971, p. 512; Rawls 1999, p.\n448). How could this claim be justified?\n\nWe can focus our attention either on individual features that humans\npossess and animals lack, and that might be thought relevant to their\ninclusion within the scope of justice, or on asymmetries in the\nrelationship between humans and other animals. To begin with the\nlatter, Hume claimed that the domination humans exercised over animals\n\u2013 such that an animal could only possess something by virtue of\nour permission \u2013 meant that we were \u2018bound by the laws of\nhumanity to give gentle usage to these creatures, but should not,\nproperly speaking, lie under any restraint of justice with regard to\nthem\u2019 (Hume, Enquiry, p. 190). For Rawls and those\ninfluenced by him, principles of distributive justice apply among\nagents who are related to one another as participants in a\n\u2018cooperative venture for mutual advantage\u2019, and this might\nseem to exclude animals from the scope of such principles. Critics of\nthis view have pointed to cases of human-animal co-operation\n(Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011, Valentini 2014); however these arguments\nfocus mainly or entirely on the special case of dogs, and it\nseems implausible to generalise from them in an attempt to show that\nhuman-animal relationships generally have a co-operative\ncharacter.\n\nBut the claim that justice only applies to participants in\nco-operative practices is anyway vulnerable to the objection that it\nrisks excluding seriously disabled people, people living in isolated\ncommunities, and future generations from the scope of justice, so it\ndoes not seem compelling as a claim about justice in general (see\nfurther below). Might there be other reasons why animals cannot make\nclaims of justice on us? Another Rawls-inspired suggestion is that\nanimals lack the necessary moral powers, in particular the capacity to\nact on principles of justice themselves. They cannot distinguish what\nis justly owed to them from what is not; and they cannot determine\nwhat they owe to others \u2013 whether to humans or to other\nnon-human animals \u2013 as a matter of justice. This suggestion\ninterprets justice as involving a kind of reciprocity: an agent to\nwhom justice is due must also in principle be an agent who could\ndispense justice to others, by virtue of having the relevant capacity,\neven if for physical reasons \u2013 such as suffering from severe\ndisability \u2013 they cannot do so in practice.\n\nIf this suggestion is rejected, and we allow that some animals, at\nleast, should be included within the scope of justice, we can then ask\nabout the form that justice should take in their cases. Using the\ndistinction drawn in 2.4 above, it appears that justice for animals\nmust be non-comparative. For example, we might attribute rights to the\nanimals over whom we exercise power \u2013 rights against cruel\ntreatment, and rights to food and shelter, for instance. This would\ninvolve using a sufficiency principle to determine what animals are\nowed as a matter of justice. It is much less plausible to think that\ncomparative principles might apply, such that giving special treats to\none cat but not another could count as an injustice.\n3.2 Relational vs Non-Relational Justice\n\nThe Rawlsian view introduced in the previous section, which holds that\nprinciples of social justice apply among people who are engaged\ntogether in a co-operative practice, is a leading example of a\nrelational theory of justice. Other theories offer different accounts\nof the relevant justice-generating feature: for example, Nagel has\nargued that principles of distributive justice apply among people who\nby virtue of being citizens of the same state are required both to\ncomply with, and accept responsibility for, the coercive laws that\ngovern their lives (Nagel 2005). In both cases, the claim being made\nis that when people stand in a certain relationship to one another,\nthey become subject to principles of justice whose scope is limited to\nthose within the relationship. In particular, comparative\nprinciples apply within the relationship, but not beyond it. If\nA stands in a relationship (of the right kind) to B,\nthen it becomes a matter of justice how A is treated relative\nto B, but it does not matter in the same way how A is\ntreated relative to C who stands outside of the relationship.\nJustice may still require that C be given treatment of a\ncertain kind, but that will be justice in its non-comparative\nguise.\n\nWhether justice is relational in either of the ways that Rawls and\nNagel suggest has large implications for its scope. In particular it\nbears on the question whether there is such a thing as global\ndistributive justice, or, in contrast, whether distributive\nprinciples only apply to people who are related together as members of\nthe same society or citizens of the same state. For example, might the\nglobal inequalities that exist between rich and poor in today\u2019s\nworld be unjust simply as inequalities, or are they unjust\nonly insofar as they prevent poor people from living lives that we\njudge to be acceptable? (see entries on\n international distributive justice\n and\n global justice)\n So much hangs on the question whether, and if so in virtue of what,\ndistributive justice has a relational character. What reason can be\ngiven for thinking that it does?\n\nSuppose we have two people A and B, of whom one is\nsignificantly better off than another \u2013 has greater\nopportunities or a higher income, say. Why should this be a concern of\njustice? It seems it will not be a concern unless it can be shown that\nthe inequality between A and B can be attributed to the\nbehaviour of some agent, individual or collective, whose actions or\nomissions have resulted in A being better off than B\n\u2013 in which case we can ask whether the inequality between them\nis justifiable, say on grounds of their respective deserts. This\nreiterates the claim in 1.4 above that without an agent to whom the\noutcome can be attributed there can only be justice or injustice in a\nmetaphorical, \u2018cosmic\u2019, sense. Relational theorists claim\nthat when people associate with one another in the relevant way, they\nbecome agents of justice. On a small scale they can organize\ninformally to ensure that each receives what is due to him relative to\nthe rest. On a larger scale, distributive justice requires the\ncreation of legal and other institutions to achieve that outcome.\nMoreover failure to co-ordinate their actions in this way is likely to\nbe a source of injustice by omission.\n\nDebates about the scope of justice then become debates about whether\ndifferent forms of human association are of the right kind to create\nagency in the relevant sense. Take the question of whether principles\nof social justice should apply to market transactions. If we see the\nmarket as a neutral arena in which many individual people freely\npursue their own purposes, then the answer will be No. The only form\nof justice that arises will be justice in the conduct of each agent,\nwho must avoid inflicting harm on others, must fulfil her contracts,\nand so forth. Whereas if we see the market as governed by a\nhumanly-constructed system of rules that the participants collectively\nhave the power to change \u2013 by legislation, for example \u2013\nthen we cannot avoid asking whether the outcomes it currently produces\nmeet relevant standards of distributive justice, whatever we take\nthese to be. A similar issue arises in the debate about over\nprinciples of global justice referred to above: is the current world\norder such that it makes sense to regard humanity as a whole as a\ncollective agent responsible for the distributive outcomes it allows\nto occur?\n3.3 Individuals vs Institutions\n\nOnce institutions are established for the purpose (among other things)\nof delivering justice on a large scale, we can ask what duties of\njustice individual people have in consequence. Is their duty simply to\nsupport the institutions, and comply with whatever rules of conduct\napply to them personally? Or do they have further duties to promote\njustice by acting directly on the relevant principles in their daily\nlives? No one doubts that some duties of justice fall\ndirectly on individuals, for example duties not to deceive or defraud\nwhen engaging in commercial transactions (and duties of corrective\njustice where behaviour is faulty), or duties to carry out one\u2019s\nfair share of an informally organized project from which one expects\nto benefit, such as cleaning up the neighbourhood park. Others fall on\nthem because they are performing a role within a social institution,\nfor example the duty of an employer not to discriminate on grounds of\nrace or gender when hiring workers, or the duty of a local government\nofficer to assign public housing to those in greatest need. But what\nis much more in dispute is whether individual people have more\nextensive duties to promote social justice (for contrasting views, see\nCohen 2008, ch. 3, Murphy 1998, Rawls 1993, Lecture VII, Young 2011,\nch. 2).\n\nConsider two cases: the first concerns parents who confer advantages\non their children in ways that undermine fair equality of opportunity.\nIf the latter principle of justice requires, to cite Rawls, that\n\u2018those who have the same level of talent and ability and the\nsame willingness to use these gifts should have the same prospects of\nsuccess regardless of their social class of origin\u2019 (Rawls 2001,\np. 44) then there are myriad ways in which some parents can bestow\nadvantages on their children that other parents cannot \u2013\nfinancial benefits, educational opportunities, social contacts, and so\nforth \u2013 that are likely to bring greater success in later life.\nAre parents therefore constrained as a matter of justice to avoid\nconferring at least some of these advantages, or are they free to\nbenefit their children as they choose, leaving the pursuit of equal\nopportunities entirely in the hands of the state (for a careful\nanalysis, see Brighouse and Swift 2014)?\n\nThe second example concerns wage differentials. Might individuals\nwhose talents can bring them high rewards in the labour market have a\nduty not to make use of their bargaining power, but instead be willing\nto work for a fair wage \u2013 which if fairness is understood in\negalitarian terms might mean the same wage as everyone else (perhaps\nwith extra compensation for those whose labour is unusually\nburdensome)? Rawls, as we saw above, argued that economic justice\nmeant arranging social and economic inequalities to the greatest\nbenefit of the least advantaged, and in formulating the principle in\nthis way he assumed that some inequalities might serve as incentives\nto greater production that would also raise the position of the\nworst-off group in society. But if individuals were willing to forego\nincentives, and so economic inequalities served no useful purpose,\nthen the arrangement that worked to the greatest benefit of the\n(otherwise) least advantaged would be one of strict equality. Cohen\n(2008) argues that Rawls\u2019 position is internally inconsistent.\nAs citizens designing our institutions we are supposed to be guided by\nthe difference principle, but as private actors in the marketplace, we\nare permitted to ignore that principle and bargain for higher wages,\neven though doing so will work to the disadvantage of the worst-off\ngroup. Justice, according to Cohen, requires us to embrace an ethos of\nservice that disdains material incentives.\n\nWhy might we hesitate before agreeing that in cases such as these,\njustice requires people to refrain from doing things that they are\npermitted to do by the public rules of their society (passing on\nbenefits to their children; seeking higher wages)? One reason is that\nthe refraining is only going to have a significant effect if it is\npractised on a large scale, and individuals have no assurance that\nothers will follow their example; meanwhile they (or their children)\nwill lose out relative to the less scrupulous. A connected reason has\nto do with publicity: it may be hard to detect whether people are\nfollowing the required ethos or not (see Williams 1998). Is the person\nwho sends her child to a private school because she claims he has\nspecial needs that the local state school cannot meet being sincere,\nor is she just trying to buy him comparative advantage? How can we\ntell whether the person who claims more money, but merely, he says, as\ncompensation for the unusual stress that his work involves, is\nreporting honestly? (for Cohen\u2019s response, see Cohen 2008, ch.\n8) It appears, then, that there are principles of justice that apply\nto what Rawls calls \u2018the basic structure of society [as] a\npublic system of rules\u2019 that do not apply in the same way to the\npersonal behaviour of the individuals who live within that structure.\nAttending to the scope, as well as the content, of\njustice is important.\n3.4 Recognition vs. Redistribution\n\nRecent philosophical writing on justice has drawn attention to forms\nof injustice that do not involve the material treatment that people\nreceive, either from other persons or from institutions, but the harms\nthey suffer through failures of recognition. They are impacted by\nsocial norms and social practices that diminish their sense of agency\nand induce them to see themselves as of lesser value than others. Here\nthen justice is understood as being adequately and appropriately\nrecognized, and injustice as involving failures of recognition, or in\nsome cases \u2018misrecognition\u2019, when a person is placed in a\ncategory or assigned an identity that is not their own. In one\ninfluential formulation of this idea, \u2018it is unjust that some\nindividuals and groups are denied the status of full partners in\nsocial interaction simply as a consequence of institutionalized\npatterns of cultural value in whose construction they have not equally\nparticipated and which disparage their distinctive characteristics or\nthe distinctive characteristics assigned to them\u2019 (Fraser in\nFraser and Honneth 2003, p. 29).\n\nWhat, then, does it mean to be recognized? In general it means to be\nviewed and treated by others in the way that is appropriate to the\nfeatures that you possess, but most philosophers regard recognition as\nmultidimensional. In particular, they distinguish between being\nrecognized as an equal, where a person is accorded the kind of\nstanding that gives them an equal status with other members of the\nrelevant group, and being recognized for having characteristics,\nachievements or an identity that may be uniquely their own.\nRecognition in this second sense may involve the unequal granting of\nsocial esteem. Justice as recognition, therefore, is internally\ncomplex. At the social level, Axel Honneth distinguishes \u2018three\nforms of social recognition, based in the sphere-specific principles\nof love, equal legal treatment, and social esteem\u2019 (Fraser and\nHonneth 2003 p. 180)\n\nThe question that arises is how best to understand the relationship\nbetween justice of this kind and distributive justice, involving the\nallocation of material resources and so forth. For Honneth, justice as\nrecognition is understood expansively so that it can also capture\nissues of economic justice, the thought being that the harm inflicted\nwhen, say, labour is not adequately rewarded can be understood as a\nfailure to offer adequate recognition of the worker\u2019s social\ncontribution. For Nancy Fraser, by contrast, recognition and\nredistribution are seen as two mutually irreducible but jointly\nnecessary conditions for social justice. Failures of recognition can\nbe experienced by some among the economically privileged \u2013 such\nas \u2018the African-American Wall Street banker who cannot get a\ntaxi to pick him up\u2019 (Fraser and Honneth 2003, p. 34). Justice\nas recognition requires cultural shifts in the way that different\nforms of identity and different types of achievement are valued that\nare independent of the institutional changes required to achieve\ndistributive justice.\n\nA particular form of recognitional injustice is epistemic\ninjustice as diagnosed by Miranda Fricker (Fricker 2007). This occurs\nwhen someone is wronged in their capacity as a source of knowledge,\nand it takes two main forms: testimonial injustice and hermeneutic\ninjustice. As Fricker explains \u2018testimonial injustice occurs\nwhen prejudice causes a hearer to give a deflated level of credibility\nto a speaker\u2019s word; hermeneutical injustice occurs at a prior\nstage when a gap in collective interpretive resources puts someone as\nat an unfair disadvantage when it comes to making sense of their\nsocial experiences\u2019 (Fricker 2007, p. 1). She argues that\ntestimonial injustice matters for two reasons. First, the person who\nsuffers from it is less able to protect or advance their interests\n\u2013 for example they are less likely to be believed when having to\ndefend themselves in court. Second, since others are unwilling to\nregard them as competent sources of knowledge, they may lose trust in\ntheir own capacity to know, leading in some cases to \u2018prolonged\nself-doubt and loss of intellectual confidence\u2019.\n\nHermeneutical injustice arises in the context of unequal relationships\nin which the subordinated party lacks the concept or concepts needed\nto make sense of their experience (and thereby to challenge their\nsubordination). Fricker uses the example of a woman who suffered\nsexual harassment at the time before feminists had developed that\nconcept, and so had no adequate word to describe what she was\nexperiencing. Hermeneutical injustice matters most when it is\nsystematic, brought about by power inequalities that leave certain\ngroups \u2018hermeneutically marginalised\u2019. However she treats\nepistemic justice as a virtue that individual hearers can develop, in\ncontrast to recognition theorists like Fraser and Honneth for whom\nachieving recognitional justice requires collective action to change\nsocial and cultural norms on the part of misrecognized groups.\n4. Utilitarianism and Justice\n\nCan justice be understood in utilitarian terms? This may in the first\nplace depend on how we interpret utilitarianism. We treat it here as a\nnormative theory whose aim is to supply a criterion \u2013 the\ngreatest happiness principle \u2013 that can be used, directly or\nindirectly, both by individuals and by institutions (such as states)\nin deciding what to do, rather than simply as a tool for evaluating\nstates of affairs. Utilitarianism cannot plausibly provide a theory of\njustice unless it is interpreted in this action-guiding way, in light\nof what was said above about justice and agency. We also assume that\nthe most likely candidate will be a rule-utilitarian view that treats\nprinciples of justice as belonging to the set of rules which when\nfollowed by the relevant agents will tend to produce the greatest\ntotal utility (for different ways of formulating this view, see the\nentry on\n rule consequentialism).\n4.1 Accommodating intuitions about justice\n\nMost utilitarians have regarded it as part of their task in defending\nutilitarianism to show that it can both accommodate and explain much\nof what we intuitively believe about justice. This is certainly true\nof two of the greatest among them, John Stuart Mill and Sidgwick, both\nof whom went to considerable lengths to show that familiar principles\nof justice could be given a utilitarian rationale (Mill\nUtilitarianism, ch. 5; Sidgwick 1874/1907, Book III, ch.5).\nBentham, in contrast, was more cavalier: \u2018justice, in the only\nsense in which it has a meaning, is an imaginary personage, feigned\nfor the convenience of discourse, whose dictates are the dictates of\nutility, applied to certain particular cases\u2019 (The\nPrinciples of Morals and Legislation, pp. 125\u20136). If we\nfollow the lead of Mill and Sidgwick in wishing to take seriously how\njustice is commonly understood, the utilitarian has two challenges to\nface. First he or she must show that the demands of justice as\ncommonly understood correspond roughly to the rules that when followed\nby persons, or implemented by institutions, are most conducive to the\ngreatest happiness. They need not mirror the latter exactly, because\nutilitarians will argue, as both Mill and Sidgwick did, that our\nintuitions about justice are often ambiguous or internally\ninconsistent, but there must be enough overlap to warrant the claim\nthat what the utilitarian theory can accommodate and explain is indeed\njustice. (As Sidgwick (1874/1907, p. 264) put it, \u2018we\nmay, so to speak, clip the ragged edge of common usage, but we must\nnot make excision of any considerable portion\u2019.) Second, some\nexplanation must be given for the distinctiveness of justice. Why do\nwe have a concept that is used to mark off a particular set of\nrequirements and claims if the normative basis for these requirements\nand claims is nothing other than general utility? What accounts for\nour intuitive sense of justice? The task confronting the utilitarian,\nthen, is to systematize our understanding of justice without\nobliterating it.\n\nBy way of illustration, both Mill and Sidgwick recognize that\ndesert, of both reward and punishment, is a key component of\ncommon understandings of justice, but they argue that if we remain at\nthe level of common sense when we try to analyse it, we run into\nirresolvable contradictions. For instance, we are inclined to think\nthat a person\u2019s deserts should depend on what they have actually\nachieved \u2013 say the economic value of what they have produced\n\u2013 but also, because achievement will depend on factors for which\nthe person in question can claim no credit, such as inborn talent,\nthat their deserts should depend only on factors for which they are\ndirectly responsible, such as the amount of effort they expend. Each\nof these conceptions, when put into practice, would lead to a quite\ndifferent schedule of rewards, and the only means to escape the\nimpasse, these utilitarians claim, is to ask which schedule will\ngenerate most utility by directing people\u2019s choices and efforts\nin the most socially productive way. Similar reasoning applies to the\nprinciples of punishment: the rules we should follow are the rules\nthat are most conducive to the ends for which punishment is\ninstituted, such as deterring crime.\n\nTo explain the distinctiveness of justice, Mill suggests that it\ndesignates moral requirements that, because of their very great\nimportance to human well-being, people have a right to have\ndischarged, and are therefore matters of perfect obligation. A person\nwho commits an injustice is always liable to punishment of some kind,\nhe argues. So he explains our sense of justice in terms of the\nresentment we feel towards someone who breaches these requirements.\nSidgwick, who laid greater stress than Mill on the connection between\njustice and law, also underlined the relationship between justice and\ngratitude, on one side, and resentment, on the other, in order to\ncapture the way in which our concern for justice seems to differ from\nour concern for utility in general.\n4.2 Utilitarian theories of justice: three problems\n\nYet despite these efforts to reconcile justice and utility, three\nserious obstacles still remain. The first concerns what we might call\nthe currency of justice: justice has to do with the way that tangible\nbenefits and burdens are assigned, and not with the happiness or\nunhappiness that the assignees experience. It is a matter of justice,\nfor example, that people should be paid the right amount for the jobs\nthat they do, but, special circumstances aside, it is no concern of\njustice that John derives more satisfaction from his fairly-earned\nincome than Jane does from hers (but see Cohen 1989 for a different\nview). There is so to speak, a division of labour, under which rights,\nopportunities, and material benefits of various kinds are allocated by\nprinciples of justice, while the conversion of these into units of\nutility (or disutility) is the responsibility of each individual\nrecipient (see Dworkin 2000, ch. 1). Utilitarians will therefore find\nit hard to explain what from their point of view seems to be the\nfetishistic concern of justice over how the means to happiness are\ndistributed, rather than happiness itself.\n\nThe second obstacle is that utilitarianism judges outcomes by\ntotalling up utility levels, and has no independent concern for how\nthat utility is distributed between persons. So even if we set aside\nthe currency issue, utilitarian theory seems unable to capture\njustice\u2019s demand that each should receive what is due\nto her regardless of the total amount of benefit this generates.\nDefenders of utilitarianism will argue that when the conduct-guiding\nrules are being formulated, attention will be paid to distributive\nquestions. In particular, when resources are being distributed among\npeople we know little about individually, there are good reasons to\nfavour equality, since in most cases resources have diminishing\nmarginal utility \u2013 the more of them you have, the less\nsatisfaction you derive from additional instalments. Yet this is only\na contingent matter. If some people are very adept at turning\nresources into well-being \u2013 they are so-called \u2018utility\nmonsters\u2019 \u2013 then a utilitarian should support a rule that\nprivileges them. This seems repugnant to justice. As Rawls famously\nput the general point, \u2018each member of society is thought to\nhave an inviolability founded on justice which\u2026.even the\nwelfare of every one else cannot override\u2019 (Rawls 1971, p. 28;\nRawls 1999, pp. 24\u201325).\n\nThe third and final difficulty stems from utilitarianism\u2019s\nthoroughgoing consequentialism. Rules are assessed strictly in the\nlight of the consequences of adopting then, not in terms of their\nintrinsic properties. Of course, when agents follow rules, they are\nmeant to do what the rule requires rather than to calculate\nconsequences directly. But for a utilitarian, it is never going to be\na good reason for adopting a rule that it will give people what they\ndeserve or what they are entitled to, when desert or entitlement are\ncreated by events in the past, such as a person\u2019s having\nperformed a worthwhile action or entered an agreement.\nBackward-looking reasons have to be transmuted into forward-looking\nreasons in order to count. If a rule such as pacta sunt\nservanda (\u2018agreements must be kept\u2019) is going to be\nadopted on utilitarian grounds, this is not because there is any\ninherent wrongness in defaulting on a compact one has made, but\nbecause a rule that compacts must be kept is a useful one, since it\nallows people to co-ordinate their behaviour knowing that their\nexpectations about the future are likely to be met. But justice,\nalthough not always backward-looking in the sense explained, often is.\nWhat is due to a person is in many cases what they deserve for what\nthey have done, or what they are entitled to by virtue of past\ntransactions. So even if it were possible to construct a\nforward-looking rationale for having rules that closely tracked desert\nor entitlement as these are normally understood, the utilitarian still\ncannot capture the sense of justice \u2013 why it matters\nthat people should get what is due to then \u2013 that informs our\ncommon-sense judgements.\n\nUtilitarians might reply that their reconstruction preserves what is\nrationally defensible in common sense beliefs while what it discards\nare elements that cannot survive sustained critical reflection. But\nthis would bring them closer to Bentham\u2019s view that justice, as\ncommonly understood, is nothing but a \u2018phantom\u2019.\n5. Contractarianism and Justice\n\nThe shortcomings of utilitarianism have prompted several recent\nphilosophers to revive the old idea of the social contract as a better\nway of bringing coherence to our thinking about justice. The idea here\nis not that people actually have entered a contract to establish\njustice, or that they should proceed to do so, but that we can\nunderstand justice better by asking the question: what principles to\ngovern their institutions, practices and personal behaviour would\npeople choose to adopt if they all had to agree on them in advance?\nThe contract, in other words, is hypothetical; but the search for\nagreement is meant to ensure that the principles chosen would, when\nimplemented, not lead to outcomes that people could not accept. Thus\nwhereas a utilitarian might, under some circumstances, be prepared to\nsupport slavery \u2013 if the misery of the slaves were outweighed by\nthe heightened pleasures of the slave-owners \u2013 contractarians\nclaims that no-one could accept a principle permitting slavery, lest\nthey themselves were destined to be slaves when the principle was\napplied.\n\nThe problem that contractarians face is to show how such an agreement\nis possible. If we were to ask people, in the real world, what\nprinciples they would prefer to live under, they are likely to start\nfrom a position of quite radical disagreement, given their interests\nand their beliefs. Some might even be willing to endorse slavery, if\nthey were fairly certain that they would not end up as slaves\nthemselves, or if they were sado-masochists who viewed the\nhumiliations inflicted on slaves in a positive light. So in order to\nshow how agreement could be achieved, contractarians have to model the\ncontracting parties in a particular way, either by limiting what they\nare allowed to know about themselves or about the future, or by\nattributing to them certain motivations while excluding others. Since\nthe modelling can be done differently, we have a family of\ncontractarian theories of justice, three of whose most important\nmembers are the theories of Gauthier, Rawls and Scanlon.\n5.1 Gauthier\n\nGauthier (1986) presents the social contract as a bargain between\nrational individuals who can gain through co-operating with one\nanother, but who are competing over the division of the resulting\nsurplus. He assumes that each is interested only in trying to maximise\nhis own welfare, and he also assumes that there is a non-co-operative\nbaseline from which the bargaining begins \u2013 so nobody would\naccept a solution that left her less well off than in the baseline\ncondition. Each person can identify the outcome under which they fare\nbest \u2013 their maximum gain \u2013 but they have no reason to\nexpect others to accept that. Gauthier argues that rational bargainers\nwill converge on the principle of Minimax Relative\nConcession, which requires each to concede the same relative\nproportion of their maximum possible gain relative to the\nnon-co-operative baseline. Thus suppose there is a feasible\narrangement whereby each participant can achieve two-thirds of their\nmaximum gain, but no arrangement under which they all do better than\nthat, then this is the arrangement that the principle recommends. Each\nperson has made the same concession relative to the outcome that is\nbest for them personally \u2013 not accepting the same absolute loss\nof welfare, let it be noted, but the same proportionate loss.\n\nThere are some internal difficulties with Gauthier\u2019s theory that\nneed to be recorded briefly (for a full discussion, see Barry 1989,\nesp. Part III). One is whether Minimax Relative Concession is in fact\nthe correct solution to the bargaining problem that Gauthier\nintroduces, as opposed to the standard Nash solution which (in a\nsimple two-person case) selects the outcome in which the product of\nthe two parties\u2019 utilities is maximised (for discussion of\ndifferent solutions to the bargaining problem, see the entry on\n contemporary approaches to the social contract,\n \u00a7 3.2). A second is whether Gauthier is able to justify positing\na \u2018Lockean\u2019 baseline, under which each is assumed to\nrespect the natural rights of the others, as the starting point for\nbargaining over the surplus \u2013 as opposed to a more conflictual\n\u2018Hobbesian\u2019 baseline in which individuals are permitted to\nuse their natural powers to threaten one another in the process of\nestablishing what each could expect to get in the absence of\nco-operation. But the larger question is whether a contract modelled\nin this way is an appropriate device for delivering principles of\njustice. On the one hand, it captures the idea that the practice of\njustice should work to everyone\u2019s advantage, while requiring all\nthose involved to moderate the demands they make on one another. On\nthe other hand, it prescribes a final distribution of benefit that\nappears morally arbitrary, in the sense that A\u2019s\nbargaining advantage over B \u2013 which stems from the fact\nthat his maximum possible gain is greater than hers \u2013 allows him\nto claim a higher level of benefit as a matter of justice.\nThis seems implausible: there may be prudential reasons to recommend a\ndistribution that reflects the outcome that self-interested and\nrational bargainers would arrive at, but claims of justice need a\ndifferent basis.\n5.2 Rawls\n\nJohn Rawls\u2019 theory of justice is the most widely-cited example\nof a contractarian theory, but before outlining it, two words of\ncaution are necessary. First, the shape of the theory has evolved from\nits first incarnation in Rawls (1958) through his major work A\nTheory of Justice (Rawls 1971) and on to Rawls (1993) and Rawls\n(2001). Second, although Rawls has consistently claimed that the\nprinciples of justice he defends are the principles that would be\nselected by people in a suitably designed \u2018original\nposition\u2019 in which they are asked to choose the social and\npolitical institutions they will live under \u2013 this is what\nqualifies his theory as contractarian \u2013 it is less clear how\nimportant a role the contract itself plays in his thinking. His\nprinciples, which are discussed elsewhere (see the entry on\n John Rawls),\n can be defended on their own merits as a theory of social justice for\na modern liberal society, even if their contractual grounding proves\nto be unsound. Rawls presents the contracting parties as seeking to\nadvance their own interests as they decide which principles to favour,\nbut under two informational constraints. First, they are not allowed\nto know their own \u2018conception of the good\u2019 \u2013 what\nends they personally find it most valuable to pursue \u2013 so the\nprinciples must be couched in terms of \u2018primary goods\u2019,\nunderstood as goods that it is better to have more rather than less of\nwhatever conception of the good you favour. Second, they are placed\nbehind a \u2018veil of ignorance\u2019 that deprives them of any\nknowledge of personal characteristics, such as their gender, their\nplace in society, or the talents and skills they possess. This means\nthat they have no basis on which to bargain for advantage, and have to\nconsider themselves as generic persons who might be male or female,\ntalented or untalented, and so forth. In consequence, Rawls argues,\nall will choose to live under impartial principles that work to\nno-one\u2019s advantage in particular.\n\nThe problem for Rawls, however, is to show that the principles that\nwould be selected in such an original position are in fact\nrecognizable as principles of justice. One might expect the\nparties to calculate how to weigh the primary goods (which Rawls\ncatalogues as \u2018rights and liberties, opportunities and powers,\nincome and wealth\u2019) against each other, and then to choose as\ntheir social principle \u2018maximise the weighted sum of primary\ngoods, averaged across all persons\u2019. This, however, would bring\nthe theory very close to utilitarianism, since the natural method of\nweighing primary goods is to ask how much utility having a given\nquantity of each is likely, on average, to bring (for the claim that\nutilitarianism would be chosen in a Rawlsian original position, see\nHarsanyi 1975). Since Rawls wishes to reject utilitarianism, he has to\nadjust the psychology of the parties in the original position so that\nthey reason differently. Thus he suggests that, at least in developed\nsocieties, people have special reason to prioritise liberty over the\nother goods and to ensure that it is equally distributed: he argues\nthat this is essential to safeguard their self-respect. In later\nwriting his argument is less empirical: now the parties to the\ncontract are endowed with \u2018moral powers\u2019 that must be\nexercised, and it is then fairly easy to show that this requires them\nto have a set of basic liberties.\n\nWhen he turns to the distribution of income and wealth, Rawls has to\nshow why his choosers would pick the difference principle, which\nconsiders only the position of the worst-off social group, over other\nprinciples such as maximising average income across the whole society.\nIn Theory of Justice he does this by attributing special\npsychological features to the choosers that make it appropriate for\nthem to follow the \u2018maximin\u2019 rule for decisions under\nuncertainty (choose the option whose worst possible outcome is least\nbad for you). For example, they are said to be much more concerned to\nachieve the minimum level of income that the difference principle\nwould guarantee them than to enjoy increases above that level. In his\nlater work, he abandons this reliance on maximin reasoning and gives\ngreater prominence to another argument hinted at in Theory.\nThis portrays the contracting parties as starting out from the\npresumption that income and wealth should be distributed equally, but\nthen recognizing that all can benefit by permitting certain\ninequalities to arise. When these inequalities are governed by the\ndifference principle, they can be justified to everyone, including the\nworst off, thus creating the conditions for a more stable society. But\nwe need then to ask why equal distribution should be treated as the\nbenchmark, departures from which require special justification. When\nRawls says that it is \u2018not reasonable\u2019 for any of the\nparties initially to expect more than an equal share (Rawls 1971, p.\n150; Rawls 1999, p. 130), is this simply a corollary of their position\nas rational choosers behind a veil of ignorance, or has Rawls in\naddition endowed them with a substantive sense of justice that\nincludes this presumption of equality?\n\nAlthough Rawls throughout presents his theory of justice as\ncontractarian, we can now see that the terms of the contract are in\npart determined by prior normative principles that Rawls engineers the\nparties to follow. So in contrast to Gauthier, it is no longer simply\na case of self-interested contractors negotiating their way to an\nagreement. Rawls candidly admits that the contractual situation has to\nbe adjusted so that it yields results that match our pre-existing\nconvictions about justice. But then we may ask how much work the\ncontractual apparatus is really doing (see Barry 1989, ch. 9 for a\ncritical appraisal).\n5.3 Scanlon\n\nScanlon (1998) does not attempt to deliver a theory of justice in the\nsame sense as Rawls, but his contractarian account of that part of\nmorality that specifies \u2018what we owe to each other\u2019 covers\nmuch of the same terrain (for an explicit attempt to analyse justice\nin Scanlonian terms, see Barry 1995). Like Rawls, Scanlon is concerned\nto develop an alternative to utilitarianism, and he does so by\ndeveloping a test that any candidate moral principle must pass: it\nmust be such that no-one could reasonably reject it as the basis for\ninformed, unforced general agreement (see the entry on\n contractualism).\n Scanlon\u2019s contractors are not positioned behind a veil of\nignorance. They are able to see what effect adopting any proposed\nprinciple would have on them personally. If that effect is\nunacceptable to them, they are permitted to reject it. Each person\nhas, so to speak, a veto on any general principle for regulating\nconduct. Those that survive this test are defensible as principles of\njustice \u2013 Scanlon concedes that there might be alternative sets\nof such principles appropriate to different social conditions.\n\nIt might seem, however, that giving each person a veto would lead\nstraightforwardly to deadlock, since anyone might reject a principle\nunder which he fared badly relative to some alternative. Here the idea\nof reasonable rejection becomes important. It would not,\nScanlon thinks, be reasonable to reject a principle under which one\ndoes badly if the alternatives all involve someone else faring worse\nstill. One needs to take account of other people\u2019s reasons for\nrejecting these alternatives. It might then appear that\nScanlon\u2019s contractualism yields the difference principle, which\nrequires the worst-off group in society to be as well of as they can\nbe. But this is not the conclusion that Scanlon draws (though he\nacknowledges that there might be special reasons to follow Rawls in\nrequiring basic social institutions to follow the difference\nprinciple). The claims of other groups must be considered too. If a\npolicy greatly benefits many others, while slightly worsening the\nposition of a few, though without leaving them very badly off, it may\nwell not be rejectable. Scanlon\u2019s position leaves some room for\naggregation \u2013 it makes a difference how many people will be\nbenefitted if a principle is followed \u2013 though not the simple\nform of aggregation that utilitarians defend.\n\nScanlon also says that a person can have a reason for rejecting a\nprinciple if it treats them unfairly, say by benefitting some but not\nothers for arbitrary reasons. This presupposes a norm of fairness that\nthe contractarian theory does not itself attempt to explain or\njustify. So it looks as though the purpose of the theory is to provide\na distinctive account of moral reasoning (and moral motivation) but\nnot to defend any substantive principles of distributive justice. In\nthis respect, Scanlon\u2019s contractualism is less ambitious than\neither Gauthier\u2019s or Rawls\u2019.\n6. Egalitarianism and Justice\n\nIn the recent past, many philosophers have sought to establish a close\nconnection between justice and equality: they ask the question\n\u2018what kind of equality does justice require?\u2019, and to that\nseveral competing answers have been given (see, for example Cohen\n1989, Dworkin 2000, Sen 1980). But we should not be too hasty to\nassume that what justice demands is always equality, whether of\ntreatment or of outcome. Perhaps it does so only in a formal sense. As\nwe saw in sect 1.3, justice requires the impartial and consistent\napplication of rules, from which it follows that when two people are\nalike in all relevant respects, they must be treated equally. But, as\nAristotle among others saw, justice also involves the idea of\nproportional treatment, which implies recipients getting unequal\namounts of whatever good is at issue (Aristotle, Nicomachean\nEthics, Book V, ch. 3). If A is twice as deserving or\ntwice as needy as B, justice may require that she receives more\nthan B does. So here formal equality of treatment \u2013 the\nsame rule applied to both \u2013 leads to an unequal outcome. Again,\nwhen justice takes the conservative form of respect for existing\nentitlements or legitimate expectations (see para 2.1) there is no\nreason to anticipate that what is due to different people will be\nsubstantively the same.\n6.1 Justice as Equality\n\nSo we need to ask about the circumstances in which justice requires a\nsubstantively equal distribution of advantages. One rather obvious\ncase occurs when the members of the group within which the\ndistribution is going to occur have no relevant distinguishing\nfeatures, so there are no grounds on which some can claim greater\nshares of benefit than others. Suppose a group experiences a windfall\ngain for which no-one can claim any credit: a pot of gold somehow\nappears in their midst. Then unless any member can make a\njustice-related claim for a larger-than-equal share \u2013 say that\nshe has special needs that she lacks sufficient resources to meet\n\u2013 an equal distribution of the gold is what justice demands,\nsince any other distribution would be arbitrary. Equality here is the\ndefault principle that applies in the absence of any special claims\nthat can be presented as reasons of justice.\n\nEquality also acts as a default in circumstances where, although\npeople may indeed have unequal claims to whatever good is being\ndistributed, we have no reliable way of identifying and measuring\nthose claims. By sharing the good equally, we can at least ensure that\nevery claim has been partially satisfied. Thus suppose we have limited\nsupplies of a drug that can treat malaria, and a number of patients\ndisplaying symptoms of the disease, but lacking specialised medical\nknowledge we cannot tell whether one person\u2019s condition is more\nserious than another\u2019s; then by sharing out the drug equally, we\ncan guarantee that each person at least receives the highest fraction\nof what they really need. Any other distribution must leave at least\none person with less (this of course assumes that there is no\nthreshold amount of the drug beneath which it is ineffective; if that\nassumption is wrong, justice under the stated conditions might require\na lottery in which the chosen ones receive threshold-size doses).\n\nIf justice requires equality only by default, it might seem to apply\nonly in a narrow range of cases. How could egalitarian justice be made\nmore robust? One approach involves declaring a wider range of factors\nirrelevant to just distribution. Thus one formulation of the principle\nholds that no-one should be worse-off than anyone else as a result of\ntheir \u2018morally arbitrary\u2019 characteristics, where a\ncharacteristic is morally arbitrary when its possessor cannot claim\ncredit for having it. This captures a widespread intuition that people\nshould not be advantaged or disadvantaged by virtue of their race or\ngender, but extends it (more controversially) to all personal features\nwith a genetic basis, such as natural talents and inborn dispositions.\nIn doing so, it discounts most claims of desert, since when people are\nsaid to deserve benefits of various kinds, it is usually for\nperforming actions or displaying qualities that depend upon innate\ncharacteristics such as strength or intelligence. In the following\nsection, we will see how egalitarian theories of justice have tried to\nincorporate some desert-like elements by way of response. But\notherwise justice as equality and justice as desert appear to be in\nconflict, and the challenge is to show what can justify equal\ntreatment in the face of inequalities of desert.\n\nA second approach answers this challenge by explaining why it is\npositively valuable to afford people equal treatment even if they do\ndisplay features that might appear to justify differential treatment.\nA prominent advocate of this approach is Dworkin, who argues that\nfundamental to justice is a principle of equal concern and respect for\npersons, and what this means in more concrete term is that equal\nresources should be devoted to the life of each member of society\n(Dworkin 2000). (The reference to membership here is not redundant,\nbecause Dworkin understands egalitarian justice as a principle that\nmust be applied within sovereign states specifically \u2013 so in the\nterms of 3.2, this is a relational view of justice.) The thought is\nthat showing persons equal respect may sometimes require us to afford\nthem equal treatment, even in the face of relevant grounds for\ndiscrimination. Thus we insist on political equality \u2013 one\nperson, one vote \u2013 even though we know that there are quite\nlarge differences in people\u2019s competence to make political\ndecisions.\n6.2 Responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism\n\nAs noted above, justice as simple equality of treatment seems open to\nthe objection that it fails to acknowledge the agency of the\nrecipients, who may have acted in ways that appear to qualify them to\nreceive more (or less) of whatever benefit is being distributed. To\nanswer this objection, several recent philosophers have presented\nalternative versions of \u2018responsibility-sensitive\negalitarianism\u2019 \u2013 a family of theories of justice that\ntreat equal distribution as a starting point but allow for departures\nfrom that baseline when these result from the responsible choices made\nby individuals (see Knight and Stemplowska 2011 for examples). These\ntheories differ along several dimensions: the \u2018currency of\njustice\u2019 used to define the baseline of equality, the conditions\nthat must be fulfilled for a choice to qualify as responsible, and\nwhich among the consequences that follow from a choice should count\nwhen the justice of an outcome is being assessed (it may in particular\nappear unjust to allow people to suffer the full consequences of bad\nchoices that they could not reasonably have anticipated). The label\nthat is often used to describe a sub-class of these theories is\n\u2018luck egalitarianism\u2019. According to luck egalitarians,\njustice requires that no-one should be disadvantaged relative to\nothers on account of \u2018brute\u2019 bad luck, whereas\ninequalities that arise through the exercise of personal\nresponsibility are permissible (for a full discussion of luck\negalitarianism, see the entry on\n justice and bad luck).\n \u2018Brute\u2019 luck is interpreted widely to include not only\nexternal circumstances such as one person\u2019s initially having\naccess to more resources than another, but also internal factors such\nas possessing natural abilities or disabilities, or having\ninvoluntarily acquired expensive tastes. All such inequalities are to\nbe ironed out by redistribution or compensation, while people\u2019s\nchoices about how to use the assets they are granted should be\nrespected, even if this leads to significant inequality in the long\nrun.\n\nLuck egalitarianism has proved surprisingly influential in recent\ndebates on justice, despite the evident difficulties involved in, for\nexample, quantifying \u2018brute luck disadvantage\u2019 in such a\nway that a compensatory scheme could be established. There are,\nhowever, a number of problems it has to face. By giving scope to\npersonal responsibility, it seeks to capture what is perhaps the most\nattractive part of the conventional idea of desert \u2013 that people\nshould be rewarded for making good choices and penalised for making\nbad ones \u2013 while filtering out the effects of having\n(undeserved) natural talents. But in reality the choices that people\nmake are influenced by the talents and other qualities that they\nhappen to have already. So if we allow someone to reap advantages by,\nfor example, devoting long hours to learning to play the piano at a\nhigh level, we must recognize that this is a choice that she would\nalmost certainly not have made unless early experiment showed that she\nwas musically gifted. We cannot say what she would have chosen to do\nin a counterfactual world in which she was tone deaf. There seems then\nto be no coherent half-way house between accepting full-blooded desert\nand denying that people can justly claim relative advantage through\nthe exercise of responsibility and choice (see further Miller 1999,\nch. 7) .\n\nA second problem is that one person\u2019s exercise of responsibility\nmay prove advantageous or disadvantageous to others, even though they\nhave done nothing to bring this change about, so from their point of\nview it must count as \u2018brute\u2019 luck. This will be true, for\nexample, in any case in which people are competing to excel in some\nfield, where successful choices made by A will worsen the\ncomparative position of B, C, and D. Or again, if\nA acts in a way that benefits B, but does nothing\ncomparable to improve the position of C and D, then an\ninequality is created that counts as \u2018brute bad luck\u2019 from\nthe perspective of the latter. One of the most influential exponents\nof luck egalitarianism seems to have recognized the problem in a late\nessay: \u2018unlike plain egalitarianism, luck egalitarianism\nis paradoxical, because the use of shares by people is\nbound to lead to a distribution flecked by luck\u2019 (Cohen\n2011, p. 142).\n6.3 Relational Egalitarianism\n\nWe have seen that equality can sometimes be understood as required by\njustice; but it can also be valued independently. Indeed there can be\ncircumstances in which the two values collide, because what justice\ndemands is inequality of outcome. The kind of inequality that is\nindependently valuable is social equality, best understood as a\nproperty of the relationships that prevail within a society: people\nregard and treat each other as social equals, and the society\u2019s\ninstitutions are designed to foster and reflect such attitudes. A\nsociety of equals contrasts with one in which people belong to\ndifferent ranks in a social hierarchy, and behave towards one another\nas their relative ranking prescribes. Different reasons can be given\nfor objecting to social inequality, and conversely for valuing social\nequality (see Scanlon 2003).\n\nThose who find equality valuable for reasons other than reasons of\ndistributive justice are often described as \u2018relational\negalitarians\u2019 (see Anderson 1999, Wolff 1998, Fourie, Schuppert\nand Wallimann-Helmer 2015). It is tempting to regard relational\negalitarianism as a rival theory of justice to the luck egalitarian\ntheory outlined in \u00a76.2, but it may be more illuminating to see\nit instead as providing an alternative account of why we should care\nabout limiting material inequality. Thus, faced with a world like the\none we currently inhabit in which income differences are very large,\njustice theorists are likely to criticize these inequalities on\ngrounds that they are not deserved, or arise from brute luck, etc.,\nwhereas relational egalitarians will say that they create a divided\nsociety in which people are alienated from each other, and cannot\ninteract in a mutually respectful way. Relational equality does not\naddress issues of distribution directly, and so cannot function as a\ntheory of justice itself, but it can provide grounds for preferring\none theory of justice to its rivals \u2013 namely that implementing\nthat particular theory is more likely to create or sustain a society\nof equals.\n7. Conclusion\n\nWe saw at the beginning of this article that justice can take a number\nof different forms, depending on the practical context in which it is\nbeing applied. Although we found common elements running through this\ndiversity of use \u2013 most readily captured in Justinian\u2019s\n\u2018suum cuique\u2019 formula \u2013 these were formal\nrather than substantive. In these circumstances, it is natural to look\nfor an overarching framework into which the various contextually\nspecific conceptions of justice can all be fitted. Three such\nframeworks were examined: utilitarianism, contractarianism and\negalitarianism. None, however, passed what we might call the\n\u2018Sidgwick/Rawls test\u2019, namely that of incorporating and\nexplaining the majority at least of our considered convictions about\njustice \u2013 beliefs that we feel confident in holding about what\njustice requires us to do in a wide and varied range of circumstances\n(for Rawls\u2019 version of the test see the entry on\n reflective equilibrium).\n So unless we are willing to jettison many of these convictions in\norder to uphold one or other general framework, we will need to accept\nthat no comprehensive theory of justice is available to us; we will\nhave to make do with partial theories \u2013 theories about what\njustice requires in particular domains of human life. Rawls himself,\ndespite the bold title of his first book (A Theory of\nJustice), came to recognize that what he had outlined was at best\na theory of social justice applied to the basic institutional\nstructure of a modern liberal state. Other forms of justice \u2013\nfamilial, allocative, associational, international \u2013 with their\nassociated principles would be applicable in their respective domains\n(for an even more explicitly pluralist account of justice, see Walzer\n1983; for a fuller defence of a contextual approach to justice, see\nMiller 2013, esp. ch. 2).\n\nOne way to loosen up our thinking about justice is by paying greater\nattention to the history of the concept. We can learn a great deal by\nreading what Aristotle, or Aquinas, or Hume, has to say about the\nconcept, but as we do so, we also see that elements we would expect to\nfind are missing (there is nothing about rights in Aristotle,\nfor example), while others that we would not anticipate are present.\nThis may in some part be due to the idiosyncrasies of each thinker,\nbut more importantly it reflects differences in the form of social\nlife in which each was embedded \u2013 its economic, legal and\npolitical structure, especially. Various attempts have been made to\nwrite histories of justice that are more than just catalogues of what\nindividual thinkers have said: they aim to trace and explain\nsystematic shifts in the way that justice has been interpreted (for\ncontrasting examples, see MacIntyre 1988, Fleischacker 2004, Johnston\n2011). These should not be read as enlightenment stories in which our\nunderstanding of justice steadily improves as the centuries roll by.\nMacIntyre\u2019s view, for example, is that modern liberal societies\ncannot sustain the practices within which notions of justice find\ntheir proper home. We can get a better grasp of what justice means to\nus by seeing the various conceptions that compete for our attention as\ntied to aspects of our social world that did not exist in the past,\nand are equally liable to disappear in the future.\n",
