    "main_text": "Understanding Music || Higher-level Musical Understanding\n4.2 Higher-level Musical Understanding\n\nFor various art-historical reasons, formalism was the dominant\napproach to music-theoretic analysis, that is, the critical\ninterpretation of musical works, throughout the twentieth century.\n(Hamilton 2007: 66\u201394 & 153\u201391 provides a useful\ndiscussion of the history from a philosophical perspective.) In short,\nthe value of works of music was held to reside primarily in their\nlarge-scale harmonic structure.\n\nJerrold Levinson (1997) makes a case against such\n\u201carchitectonicism\u201d in favor of\n\u201cconcatenationism,\u201d the view that basic musical\nunderstanding consists in following the musical and emotional\nqualities of passages of music, and transitions between them, that are\nshort enough to be apprehended as a single experience\n(\u201cquasi-hearing\u201d). He qualifies this basic idea\nconsiderably, allowing for the experience of previous parts of the\npiece, and anticipation of future parts, to modify one\u2019s\nexperience of the music in the moment. He also allows that\narchitectonic awareness may play a role in enhancing one\u2019s\nmoment-to-moment experience, and may even play an ineliminable part in\nthe understanding of some pieces. Nonetheless, Levinson maintains that\nthe part played by architectonic knowledge in basic musical\nunderstanding is minimal, and that the cases where architectonic\nknowledge is necessary are very much the exception.\n\nPeter Kivy has taken up the gauntlet on behalf of architectonicism\n(2001; see also S. Davies 2011c: 95\u20139). While Kivy acknowledges\nthat the kinds of experiences Levinson champions are necessary to\nbasic musical understanding, he defends the idea that grasping the\nlarge-scale form of most pieces of Western classical music, at least,\nis necessary for an adequate understanding of them. He does not deny\nthat the experience of the form of a piece in listening to it is more\nintellectual than quasi-hearing, but he rejects Levinson\u2019s\nargument that it is non-perceptual, and thus marginal to an adequate\nexperience of it as music. Rather, Kivy argues, such experience is a\nmatter of bringing one\u2019s perceptions under sophisticated\nconcepts. (A tactic Kivy does not consider is an attempt to hoist\nLevinson with his own contextualist petard, arguing that even if\narchitectonic listening is non-perceptual it is a well-established\nmode of understanding pieces of music in the Western classical music\nworld, and thus that to argue music must be understood primarily\nperceptually is to beg the question.)\n\nThe extent of the disagreement between the architectonicist and the\nconcatenationist is unclear. They agree that the aspect of musical\nunderstanding the other emphasizes is a non-negligible component in\nthe full understanding of a musical work. Levinson has been explicit\nsince the first publication of his view that he intends it more as a\npolemic against and corrective to architectonicism, rather than as a\nreplacement for it (1997: ix\u2013xi; 1999: 485; 2006a). Perhaps that\npurpose has now been fulfilled, but see Huovinen 2013 for a revival of\nthe debate and an attempted synthesis.\n",
