    "main_text": "Aesthetics || Aesthetic Qualities\n7.2 Aesthetic Qualities\n\n\nReid's account of what makes a work of art beautiful or sublime is\nwidely regarded as the most distinctive feature of Reid's\naesthetics. In his correspondence, he writes, \u201cI am proud to\nthink that I first, in clear and explicit terms, and in the cool blood\nof a philosopher, maintained that all the beauty and sublimity of\nobjects of sense is derived from the expression they exhibit of things\nintellectual, which alone have original beauty\u201d (Letter to\nArchibald Alison, in Correspondence 209). (In characteristic\nfashion, the next sentence reads: \u201cBut in this I may deceive\nmyself, & cannot claim to be held an impartial judge\u201d\n(Correspondence 209).) Material objects are not by nature\nbeautiful or sublime, but are only made so by the infusion of mental\nstates. The beauty in material objects derives from mental and\nintellectual qualities that \u201cexcite our esteem\u201d\n(Lectures on the Fine Arts 41\u20132; see EIP 8.3, 590). To be\nclear, brushstrokes and melodies, clay forms and the use of poetic\nmeter, and the (broadly) physical works of which they are a part are\nnot beautiful. Rather, these are signs, to the admirer, of the beauty,\ndepth, or grandeur of the mental states in the artist that they\nsuggest. In the case of Homer's Illiad, Reid says, \u201cits\nsublimity was really in the mind of HOMER. He conceived great\ncharacters, great actions, and great events, in a manner suitable to\ntheir nature, and with those emotions which they are naturally fitted\nto produce... The grandeur of his thoughts is reflected to our eye by\nhis work, and therefore it is justly called a grand work\u201d (EIP\n8.3, 587).\n\n\nThis idea has been met with criticism by Reid's commentators. This\nseems absurd since it follows that Homer's Illiad is not\nitself beautiful or sublime (Gallie 1998). But there are resources\nwithin the expressive theory to address this criticism with some\nsuccess. The best way to understand Reid's theory is that the beauty\nof the artwork rests in the manner of its expression and not in what\nit expresses (Kivy 2004, 284\u20135). Perhaps, though an expressivist\ntheory can be absolved of the problem, Reid's own version of it cannot\nbe. The Illiad remains distinct from its manner of\nexpression, and it is counterintuitive to say that the Illiad\nitself is not beautiful.\n\n\nReid does not distinguish between the Illiad qua written text\nand qua oral poetry; doing so informs debate both about the manner of\nexpression of the work and about the sublimity of the mental states\nthat gave it rise. By switching from Reid's example of literature to\nmusic we can take account of something like this distinction and\ntherefore better respond to the objection under discussion. In the\ncase of musical performance, the manner of expression and the content\nof what is expressed are distinct: the manner of a performance of a\nsymphony may differ substantially when led by two different\nconductors. In each case it is distinct from the symphony itself (so\nas long as the symphony is not identical to the set of its\nperformances). We are inclined to say that the performance of a\nsymphony is beautiful, and we are not inclined to say that \u2018the\nsymphony itself\u2019 is beautiful. This comports well with Reid's\ntheory. This suggestion requires assumptions about the ontology of\nartworks; Reid does not discuss these matters at any length.\n\n\nThis discussion leads to a final consideration of Reid's\naesthetics\u2014the ontology of aesthetic qualities. Reid says that\nbeauty \u201cis derived\u201d from the expression of mental events,\nbut Reid says little about the ontology of beauty. Commentators have\ngravitated to this particular issue, but the results of this research\nare mixed. Four views predominate, and each can be characterized in\nterms of the relations espoused between aesthetic qualities and Reid's\nfinely grained distinction between primary and secondary\nqualities. (i) Aesthetic qualities are secondary qualities, and that\nReid mistakenly compares aesthetic qualities to primary qualities\n(Kivy 1970). Beauty, on this interpretation, is in the mind. But it is\nnot in the mind\u2014or eye\u2014of the beholder. Rather, beauty is\nin the mind of the artist, and the artwork provides a sign of the\nmental states of the artist. (ii) Aesthetic qualities are primary\nqualities and secondary qualities, which suggests that this feature of\nReid's aesthetics is incoherent (Gracyk 1987). (iii) Aesthetic\nqualities are neither primary nor secondary qualities, which also\nposes serious problems for Reid's aesthetics (Nauckhoff 1994). (iv)\nAesthetic qualities bear features of both secondary and primary\nqualities (Benbaji 2000). Aesthetic qualities are like secondary\nqualities because both are dispositional, while they are like primary\nqualities because our judgments about them are incorrigible.\n\n\nThough (i)-(iv) are framed in terms of Reid's distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities, none of these four major positions\nbegins from a considered account of Reid's views on the perceptual and\nepistemological status of qualities. Consider (ii). This\ncharacterization of aesthetic qualities is not itself reason to\ndismiss Reid's ontology of aesthetic qualities as incoherent. This is\nbecause one interesting feature of Reid's distinctions between primary\nand secondary qualities is that what is a primary quality for one\nperson may be a secondary quality for another. Reid's aesthetics is an\nunder-explored area ripe for further research.\n",
