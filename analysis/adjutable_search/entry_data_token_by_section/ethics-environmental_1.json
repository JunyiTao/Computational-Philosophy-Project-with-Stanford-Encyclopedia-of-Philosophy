The Development of Environmental Ethics\n\nAlthough nature was the focus of much nineteenth and twentieth century\nphilosophy, contemporary environmental ethics only emerged as an\nacademic discipline in the 1970s. The questioning and rethinking of\nthe relationship of human beings with the natural environment over the\nlast thirty years reflected an already widespread perception in the\n1960s that the late twentieth century faced a human population\nexplosion as part of a serious environmental crisis. Among the\naccessible work that drew attention to a sense of crisis was Rachel\nCarson\u2019s Silent Spring (1963), which consisted of a\nnumber of essays earlier published in the New Yorker magazine\ndetailing how pesticides such as DDT, aldrin and dieldrin concentrated\nthrough the food web. Commercial farming practices using these\nchemicals to maximize crop yields and profits, Carson speculates, are\ncapable of impacting simultaneously on environmental and public\nhealth. Their use, she claims, can have the side effects of killing\nother living things (besides the targeted insects) and causing human\ndisease. While Carson correctly fears that over-use of pesticides may\nlead to increases in some resistant insect species, the\nintensification of agriculture, land-clearing and massive use of\nneonicotonoid pesticides has subsequently contributed to a situation\nin which, according to some reviews, nearly half of insect species are\nthreatened with extinction (S\u00e1nchez-Bayo and Wickhuys 2019, and\ncompare van der Sluijs and Vaage 2016, Komonen, Halme and Kotiaho\n2019). Declines in insect populations not only threaten pollination of\nplant species, but may also be responsible for huge declines in some\nbird populations (Goulson 2021) and appear to go hand in hand with\ncascading extinctions across ecosystems worldwide (Kehoe, Frago and\nSanders 2021).\n\nIn a much cited essay (White 1967) on the historical roots of the\nenvironmental crisis, historian Lynn White argued that the main\nstrands of Judeo-Christian thinking had encouraged the\noverexploitation of nature by maintaining the superiority of humans\nover all other forms of life on earth, and by depicting all of nature\nas created for the use of humans. White\u2019s thesis was widely\ndiscussed in theology, history, and has been subject to some\nsociological testing as well as being regularly discussed by\nphilosophers (see Whitney 1993, Attfield 2001). Central to the\nrationale for his thesis were the works of the Church Fathers and The\nBible itself, supporting the anthropocentric perspective that humans\nare the only things on Earth that matter in themselves. Consequently,\nthey may utilize and consume everything else to their advantage\nwithout any injustice. For example, Genesis 1: 27\u20138\nstates: \u201cGod created man in his own image, in the image of God\ncreated he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them,\nand God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the\nearth, and subdue it: and have dominion over fish of the sea, and over\nfowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the\nearth.\u201d Likewise, Thomas Aquinas (Summa Contra\nGentiles, Bk. 3, Pt 2, Ch 112) argued that non-human animals are\n\u201cordered to man\u2019s use\u201d. According to White, the\nJudeo-Christian idea that humans are created in the image of the\ntranscendent supernatural God, who is radically separate from nature,\nalso by extension radically separates humans themselves from nature.\nThis ideology further opened the way for untrammeled exploitation of\nnature. Modern Western science itself, White argued, was \u201ccast\nin the matrix of Christian theology\u201d so that it too inherited\nthe \u201corthodox Christian arrogance toward nature\u201d (White\n1967: 1207). Clearly, without technology and science, the\nenvironmental extremes to which we are now exposed would probably not\nbe realized. The point of White\u2019s thesis, however, is that given\nthe modern form of science and technology, Judeo-Christianity itself\nprovides the original deep-seated drive to unlimited exploitation of\nnature. Nevertheless, White argued that some minority traditions\nwithin Christianity (e.g., the views of St. Francis) might provide an\nantidote to the \u201carrogance\u201d of a mainstream tradition\nsteeped in anthropocentrism. This sentiment is echoed in later\nChristian writings on attitudes to nature (see for example Berry 2018,\nchs 10, 11, and compare Zaheva and Szasz 2015).\n\nAround the same time, the Stanford ecologists Paul and Anne Ehrlich\nwarned in The Population Bomb (Ehrlich 1968) that the growth\nof human population threatened the viability of planetary life-support\nsystems. The sense of environmental crisis stimulated by those and\nother popular works was intensified by NASA\u2019s production and\nwide dissemination of a particularly potent image of Earth from space\ntaken at Christmas 1968 and featured in the Scientific\nAmerican in September 1970. Here, plain to see, was a living,\nshining planet voyaging through space and shared by all of humanity, a\nprecious vessel vulnerable to pollution and to the overuse of its\nlimited capacities. In 1972 a team of researchers at MIT led by Donella\nMeadows published the Limits to Growth study, a work that\nsummed up in many ways the emerging concerns of the previous decade\nand the sense of vulnerability triggered by the view of the earth from\nspace. In the commentary to the study, the researchers wrote:\n\nWe affirm finally that any deliberate attempt to reach a rational and\nenduring state of equilibrium by planned measures, rather than by\nchance or catastrophe, must ultimately be founded on a basic change of\nvalues and goals at individual, national and world levels. (Meadows et\nal. 1972: 195)\n\n\nThe call for a \u201cbasic change of values\u201d in connection to\nthe environment (a call that could be interpreted in terms of either\ninstrumental or intrinsic values) reflected a need for the development\nof environmental ethics as a new sub-discipline of philosophy. The aim\nof facing up to the challenge of limited resources was fostered\nsubsequently by studies of the growing human \u201cecological\nfootprint\u201d on the earth (Rees 1992, Wackernagel et al.\n2018) and by the exploration of \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d and\nthe concept of a \u201csafe operating space for humanity\u201d\n(Rokstr\u00f6m et al. 2009, Biermann and Kim 2020).\n\nThe new field emerged almost simultaneously in three\ncountries\u2014the United States, Australia, and Norway. In the first\ntwo of these countries, direction and inspiration largely came from\nthe earlier twentieth century American literature of the environment.\nFor instance, the Scottish emigrant John Muir (founder of the Sierra\nClub and \u201cfather of American conservation\u201d) and\nsubsequently the forester Aldo Leopold had advocated an appreciation\nand conservation of things \u201cnatural, wild and free\u201d. Their\nconcerns were motivated by a combination of ethical and aesthetic\nresponses to nature as well as a rejection of crudely economic\napproaches to the value of natural objects (a historical survey of the\nconfrontation between Muir\u2019s reverentialism and the\nhuman-centred conservationism of Gifford Pinchot (one of the major\ninfluences on the development of the US Forest Service) is provided in\nNorton 1991; also see Cohen 1984 and Nash (ed) 1990). Leopold\u2019s\nA Sand County Almanac (1949), in particular, advocated the\nadoption of a \u201cland ethic\u201d:\n\nThat land is a community is the basic concept of ecology, but that\nland is to be loved and respected is an extension of ethics. (Leopold\n1949: vii\u2013ix)\n\n\nA thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability,\nand beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends\notherwise. (Leopold 1949: 224\u20135)\n\n\nHowever, Leopold himself provided no systematic ethical theory or\nframework to support these ethical ideas concerning the environment.\nHis views therefore presented a challenge and opportunity for moral\ntheorists: could some ethical theory be devised to justify the\ninjunction to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the\nbiosphere?\n\nThe land ethic sketched by Leopold, attempting to extend our moral\nconcern to cover the natural environment and its non-human contents,\nwas drawn on explicitly by the Australian philosopher Richard Routley\n(later Sylvan). According to Routley (1973 (cf. Routley and Routley\n1980)), the anthropocentrism imbedded in what he called the\n\u201cdominant western view\u201d, or \u201cthe western\nsuperethic\u201d, is in effect \u201chuman chauvinism\u201d. This\nview, he argued, is just another form of class chauvinism, which is\nsimply based on blind class \u201cloyalty\u201d or prejudice, and\nunjustifiably discriminates against those outside the privileged\nclass. Echoing the plot of a popular movie some three years earlier\n(see Lo and Brennan 2013), Routley speculates in his \u201clast\nman\u201d (and \u201clast people\u201d) arguments about a\nhypothetical situation in which the last person, surviving a world\ncatastrophe, acts to ensure the elimination of all other living things\nand the last people set about destroying forests and ecosystems after\ntheir demise. From the human-chauvinistic (or absolutely\nanthropocentric) perspective, the last person would do nothing morally\nwrong, since his or her destructive act in question would not cause\nany damage to the interests and well-being of humans, who would by\nthen have disappeared. Nevertheless, Routley points out that there is\na moral intuition that the imagined last acts would be morally wrong.\nAn explanation for this judgment, he argues, is that those non-human\nobjects in the environment, whose destruction is ensured by the last\nperson or last people, have intrinsic value, a kind of value\nindependent of their usefulness for humans. From his critique, Routley\nconcluded that the main approaches in traditional western moral\nthinking were unable to allow the recognition that natural things have\nintrinsic value, and that the tradition required overhaul of a\nsignificant kind.\n\nLeopold\u2019s idea that the \u201cland\u201d as a whole is an\nobject of our moral concern also stimulated writers to argue for\ncertain moral obligations toward ecological wholes, such as species,\ncommunities, and ecosystems, not just their individual constituents.\nThe U.S.-based theologian and environmental philosopher Holmes Rolston\nIII, for instance, argued that species protection was a moral duty\n(Rolston 1975). It would be wrong, he maintained, to eliminate a rare\nbutterfly species simply to increase the monetary value of specimens\nalready held by collectors. Like Routley\u2019s \u201clast\nman\u201d arguments, Rolston\u2019s example is meant to draw\nattention to a kind of action that seems morally dubious and yet is\nnot clearly ruled out or condemned by traditional anthropocentric\nethical views. Species, Rolston went on to argue, are intrinsically\nvaluable and are usually more valuable than individual specimens,\nsince the loss of a species is a loss of genetic possibilities and the\ndeliberate destruction of a species would show disrespect for the very\nbiological processes which make possible the emergence of individual\nliving things (also see Rolston 1989, Ch 10). Natural processes\ndeserve respect, according to Rolston\u2019s quasi-religious\nperspective, because they constitute a nature (or God) which is itself\nintrinsically valuable (or sacred).\n\nMeanwhile, the work of Christopher Stone (a professor of law at the\nUniversity of Southern California) had become widely discussed. Stone\n(1972) proposes that trees and other natural objects should have at\nleast the same standing in law as corporations. This suggestion was\ninspired by a particular case in which the Sierra Club had mounted a\nchallenge against the permit granted by the U.S. Forest Service to\nWalt Disney Enterprises for surveys preparatory to the development of\nthe Mineral King Valley, which was at the time a relatively remote\ngame refuge, but not designated as a national park or protected\nwilderness area. The Disney proposal was to develop a major resort\ncomplex serving 14000 visitors daily to be accessed by a purpose-built\nhighway through Sequoia National Park. The Sierra Club, as a body with\na general concern for wilderness conservation, challenged the\ndevelopment on the grounds that the valley should be kept in its\noriginal state for its own sake.\n\nStone reasoned that if trees, forests and mountains could be given\nstanding in law then they could be represented in their own right in\nthe courts by groups such as the Sierra Club. Moreover, like any other\nlegal person, these natural things could become beneficiaries\nof compensation if it could be shown that they had suffered\ncompensatable injury through human activity. When the case went to the\nU.S. Supreme Court, it was determined by a narrow majority that the\nSierra Club did not meet the condition for bringing a case to court,\nfor the Club was unable and unwilling to prove the likelihood of\ninjury to the interest of the Club or its members. In dissenting\nminority judgments, however, justices Douglas, Blackmun and Brennan\nmentioned Stone\u2019s argument: his proposal to give legal standing\nto natural things, they said, would allow conservation interests,\ncommunity needs and business interests to be represented, debated and\nsettled in court. Stone\u2019s work was later cited in the successful\narguments to grant personhood to rivers and other natural features in\nvarious parts of the world. In some of these cases, Stone\u2019s\narguments\u2014along with those of Arne N\u00e6ss (see\nbelow)\u2014have been said to provide analogues to indigenous\nunderstandings of the intrinsic value of the land and the\ninterconnections of such understandings with human actions and\nancestral spirituality (Morris and Ruru 2010, Kramm 2020). Similar\nsuggestions have also been made about Leopold\u2019s work, but such\nclaims need to be interpreted with caution (White 2015).\n\nReacting to Stone\u2019s proposal, Joel Feinberg (1974) raised a\nserious problem. Only items that have interests, Feinberg argued, can\nbe regarded as having legal standing and, likewise, moral standing.\nFor it is interests which are capable of being represented in legal\nproceedings and moral debates. This same point would also seem to\napply to political debates. For instance, the movement for\n\u201canimal liberation\u201d, which also emerged strongly in the\n1970s, can be thought of as a political movement aimed at representing\nthe previously neglected interests of some animals (see Regan and\nSinger (eds.) 1976, Clark 1977, and also the entry on\n the moral status of animals).\n Granted that some animals have interests that can be represented in\nthis way, would it also make sense to speak of trees, forests, rivers,\nbarnacles, or termites as having interests of a morally relevant kind?\nThis issue was hotly contested in the years that followed. Meanwhile,\nJohn Passmore (1974) argued, like White, that the Judeo-Christian\ntradition of thought about nature, despite being predominantly\n\u201cdespotic\u201d, contained resources for regarding humans as\n\u201cstewards\u201d or \u201cperfectors\u201d of God\u2019s\ncreation. Skeptical of the prospects for any radically new ethic,\nPassmore cautioned that traditions of thought could not be abruptly\noverhauled. Any change in attitudes to our natural surroundings which\nstood the chance of widespread acceptance, he argued, would have to\nresonate and have some continuities with the very tradition which had\nlegitimized our destructive practices.\n\nIn sum, then, Leopold\u2019s land ethic, the historical analyses of\nWhite and Passmore, the pioneering work of Routley, Stone and Rolston,\nand the warnings of scientists, had by the late 1970s focused the\nattention of philosophers and political theorists firmly on the\nenvironment. The confluence of ethical, political and legal debates\nabout the environment, the emergence of philosophies to underpin\nanimal rights activism and the puzzles over whether an environmental\nethic would be something new rather than a modification or extension\nof existing ethical theories were reflected in wider social and\npolitical movements. The rise of environmental or \u201cgreen\u201d\nparties in Europe in the 1980s was accompanied by almost immediate\nschisms between groups known as \u201crealists\u201d versus\n\u201cfundamentalists\u201d (see Dobson 1990). The\n\u201crealists\u201d stood for reform environmentalism, working with\nbusiness and government to soften the impact of pollution and resource\ndepletion especially on fragile ecosystems or endangered species. The\n\u201cfundies\u201d argued for radical change, the setting of\nstringent new priorities, and even the overthrow of capitalism and\nliberal individualism, which were taken as the major ideological\ncauses of anthropogenic environmental devastation. It is not clear,\nhowever, that collectivist or communist countries do particularly well\nin terms of their environmental record (see Dominick 1998). At the\nsame time, the rise of \u201cenvironmental authoritarianism\u201d in\nsome non-democratic countries appears to show that liberal democracies\nmay not have a monopoly on effective action to support sustainability\nand biodiversity (Beeson 2010, Shahar 2015).\n\nUnderlying these political disagreements was the distinction between\n\u201cshallow\u201d and \u201cdeep\u201d environmental movements,\na distinction introduced in the early 1970s by another major influence\non contemporary environmental ethics, the Norwegian philosopher and\nclimber Arne N\u00e6ss. Since the work of N\u00e6ss has been\nsignificant in environmental politics, the discussion of his position\nis given in a separate section below.\n",
