Besides the vast corpus of his\nwritings that fostered a generation of Dominican scholars in the\nGerman-speaking province, Albert lived long enough to impart\ncontinuity to this generation, which included Ulrich of\nStra\u00dfburg (c.1225\u20131277), Dietrich of Freiberg\n(1250\u20131310), and Meister Eckhart (c. 1260\u2013c. 1327). All\nof these men made extraordinary contributions to medieval philosophy,\ntheology, and in the case of Dietrich of Freiberg, natural\nscience.

    "main_text": "\n1. Life of Dietrich of Freiberg\n\n\nLittle is known with certainty about the life of Dietrich of\nFreiberg. He was born in Freiberg in Saxony around the year 1250. He\nis sometimes referred to as \u201cDietrich of Saxony,\u201d and\noften as \u201cTheodoricus Teutonicus.\u201d He is also mentioned in\nmedieval documents as \u201cMagister\u201d or \u201cMaster,\u201d\nindicating that he had advanced university training. He joined the\nDominican order at a young age. We know that he was still a youth when\nAlbertus Magnus was coming to the end of his career. But it is not\nknown whether Dietrich studied under Albert or ever met him. Around\nthe year 1271 he served as lector in the Dominican convent at Freiberg\nin Saxony. That he studied at Paris is clear, that it was sometime\nduring the period between 1272\u20131274 is probable. But it is not\nknown with whom he studied. There is evidence provided by Dietrich\u2019s\nown hand, found in chapter thirty of the second part of his\nTractatus de intellectu et intelligibili and in other places\nin his works that suggests he may have studied under Henry of Ghent.\nDietrich mentions a certain \u201csolemn master\u201d whom he heard\ndispute in Paris. Henry was known to his students as \u201cdoctor\nsolemnis\u201d and perhaps \u201cmagister solemnis\u201d as\nwell. An examination of Dietrich\u2019s writings suggests some themes that\ncould possibly owe their origins to Henry of Ghent. But the matter is\nuncertain, and it does not seem that a careful study of the writings\nof either of these great masters will reveal their historical\nrelations to one another.\n\n\nDietrich returned to Germany in 1280 and held the post of lector in\nthe city of Trier until 1281. He returned to Paris in 1281 in order to\nhold lectures on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, perhaps at\nSaint-Jacques. He may have remained in Paris until 1293. Although the\ndocuments are not clear, most historians agree that he was appointed\nprior of the Dominican convent in W\u00fcrzburg. In 1293 he was named\nProvincial Superior of his order for the province of Germany, Albert\nthe Great\u2019s old post. Somewhere between 1296 and 1297 he was made\n\u201cMaster of Theology\u201d at Paris. He continued to teach in\nParis until 1300. In 1304 he was present at the general chapter of the\nDominican order held at Toulouse. His name last appears in the acts of\nthe general chapter of the order held in Piacenza in 1310. There he\nwas appointed Vicar Provincial of Germany. After this time his name\ndrops out of the documents.(Eckert 1957/1959; Kandler 2009)\n2. Philosophical Works\n\n\nDietrich was a prolific writer. His writings include compositions on\nnearly every branch of theology, philosophy, and natural science known\nto his period. His philosophical and scientific works far outnumber\nhis strictly theological treatises. His Opera omnia,\npublished in the Corpus Philosophorum Teutonicorum Medii\nAevi, occupy four volumes. Among his theological writings are\nincluded his treatises on the beatific vision (De visione\nbeatifica), on the nature of Christ\u2019s body after the crucifixion\n(De corpore Christi mortuo), on the nature of glorified\nbodies (De dotibus corporum gloriosorum), on spiritual\nsubstances and the resurrection (De substantiis spiritualibus et\ncorporibus futurae resurrectionis).\n\n\nHis philosophical writings, allowing that some may be classified also\nas scientific works, include: De habitibus, De ente et\nessentia, De magis et minus, De natura\ncontrariorum, De cognitione entium separatorum et maxime\nanimarum separatarum, De intelligentiis et motoribus\ncaelorum, De corporibus caelestibus quoad naturam eorum\ncorporalem, De animatione caeli, De\naccidentibus, De quiditatibus entium, De origine\nrerum praedicamentalium, De mensuris, De natura et\nproprietate continuorum, and the De intellectu et\nintelligibili.\n\n\nDietrich\u2019s scientific treatises are famous. His treatises on light\n(De luce), on color (De coloribus), and on the\nrainbow (De iride) contributed greatly to the development of\noptics and were composed in the scientific spirit of Albertus Magnus.\nFr. William A. Wallace in his The Scientific Methodology of\nTheodoric of Freiberg, one of the few studies of Dietrich in\nEnglish, demonstrates the dependence of Dietrich\u2019s scientific\nmethodology on his philosophical theories, and particularly his\nlogical writings. This dependence reveals the Albertist tendency in\nDietrich, leaving no doubt that in some way he was influenced by the\nwritings and spirit of Albert the Great.\n\n\nIt is important in the consideration of any of Dietrich of Freiberg\u2019s\nwritings to remember that he was the kind of philosopher who\nconstructed his various works from a metaphysical point of view,\nwhether they were scientific studies on light or theological treatises\non the beatific vision. For care and attention to developing a correct\naccount of the nature of being, he tells us, will allow the\nphilosopher to avoid many errors. The concept of being (ens),\nhe notes, is the most fundamental of notions, distinguishing a thing\nfrom nothingness. Indeed, one can find many places in his writings\nwhere an important philosophical point or crucial distinction hinges\non what Dietrich understands to be the correct notion of being, or\nessence, or quiddity. It is best then to begin the development of an\naccount of Dietrich as a philosopher by attending to his\nmetaphysics.\n\n\nFortunately Dietrich concentrated his analysis of the key concepts of\nhis metaphysics in two relatively short treatises, De ente et\nessentia and De quiditatibus entium. As a result it is\nnot necessary to reconstruct his metaphysics by searching for the\nmetaphysical presuppositions of the entire body of his philosophical\nwritings, as is often the case with other philosophical writers. In\nfact one of the characteristics of Dietrich as a thinker is the\nsystematic way in which he not only orders his thoughts but his\ntreatises as well. And so we need only consider these two works in\norder to discover his particular view of being, essence and quiddity\nthat specifies his philosophical thinking.\n3. Existence and Essence\n\n\nDietrich\u2019s De ente et essentia which bears the same title as\nThomas Aquinas\u2019 opuscule is indeed a work that gives much evidence of\nhaving been prepared as a kind of rebuttal to certain doctrines of\nAquinas. Both works open with a reference from Aristotle to the effect\nthat care and caution must be taken early in the study of metaphysics\nwith regard to fundamental notions. In fact Dietrich divides his\ntreatise into two parts, devoting the first part to an analysis of the\nkey metaphysical terms esse, ens, entitas,\nquid, and quiditas. In opposition to Aquinas he\nproposes the thesis that there is no real distinction between\nexistence (esse) and essence (essentia). The\nexistence of a thing expresses its essence and vice versa. The two\nnotions differ only in the way they denote the thing of which they are\npredicated (in modis significandi)\u2014existence expressing\nbeing in the mode of an act, essence in the mode of a possession and\nthe term of an act.\n\n\nThe second part of the De ente et essentia proposes\narguments, mainly based on Aquinas that deny the identity of essence\nand existence. Dietrich refutes each one of these arguments. The\nprincipal argument from Aquinas that Dietrich refutes is based on the\npremise that it is possible to understand what something is without\nknowing that it exists. Thus it follows according to Aquinas that\nesse is not included in the understanding of a thing\u2019s\nessentia, and therefore must be distinct from it. Dietrich\nresponds to this argument by challenging its premise. An essence is\nsuch only because it refers to an existent. That this is so is seen\nfrom the very etymology of the word \u201cessence\u201d as accounted\nfor by St.  Augustine who argued that \u201cessentia\u201d\nis derived from \u201cesse\u201d. But the issue that lies\nbetween Dietrich and his confrere is not one of words but of\nprinciples. Armand Maurer, in his important article \u201cThe De\nQuidditatibus Entium of Dietrich of Freiberg and its Criticism of\nThomistic Metaphysics\u201d, sums the matter up well when he\nobserves:\n\n\nFor St. Thomas, essence is a principle in created being other than\nesse and receptive of it. As potential to, and receptive of esse,\nessence is thus a principle through which and in which a thing exists.\nNot so for Dietrich. Essence, in his view, is not subject to an influx\nof esse. It is the very beingness of the thing, and hence that through\nwhich it may be said to be outside of nothingness.\n\n\n\n\nDietrich correlates his thesis of the real identity of existence and\nessence with his concept of being, both in its concrete form as ens or\nparticular being and its abstract form as entitas.\nEns denotes the essence of whatever is a determinate existing\nindividual, while entitas denotes the same thing in\nabstraction. Ens is the most basic of all metaphysical\nconcepts for Dietrich. It is that which first distinguishes a thing\nfrom nothingness. Both ens and entitas identify with\nessence. So one could say according to Dietrich that in considering a\nwhite ball for example, its ens is white, its\nentitas is whiteness, and its essence is that through which\nit is white and participates in whiteness.\n4. Quid and Quiddity\n\n\nDietrich\u2019s account of quid and quiditas is more\nlimited. He takes up these concepts in his De quiditatibus\nentium. Where ens, entitas, esse, and\nessentia are all existential terms answering the question\nwhether something exists, in the De quiditatibus he considers\nthe question \u201cWhat is it that exists?\u201d He begins the\ntreatise by distinguishing quid and quiditas from\nthe existential terms, and then proceeds to consider the differences\nwith respect to being in substance, in logical concepts or intentions,\nand in accidents. Again, unlike Aquinas who equated essentia\nand quiditas, Dietrich sees these metaphysical concepts are\nbeing different, but not totally unrelated.And while Aquinas accepts\nthe separability of accidents, Dietrich rejects the notion.\n\n\nThe analysis which De quiditatibus provides is subtle. The\nterm \u201cquid\u201d denotes the essential mode of the\nbeing of a thing, that is, the mode of being by which it exists as a\nbeing of a certain kind. It answers the question \u201cWhat is\nit?\u201d On the other hand, quiditas denotes the formality\nby means of which a thing is a quid. It is tempting to see a\nconnection here between ens, entitas and\nquid, quiditas such that the second is the condition\nof the first. This may lead unwary reasoners, as Dietrich no doubt\nfelt Thomas Aquinas and others were, into equating entitas\nand quiditas. But quiditas denotes the formal\ndetermination of a thing. This is something over and above the being\nof the thing. It is a form, the form of a thing. But it is not the\nsame as the thing. Hence it cannot be equated with either the\nens or the entitas of the thing. Of course quiddity\npresupposes ens and esse; without its existence\nthere could be no determination of a thing.\n\n\nAccording to Dietrich quiddity is properly defined as the formal\ndetermination of a being, giving it its specific intrinsic character\nby means of which it can also be known. Strictly speaking, therefore,\nquiddity is found only in composite beings since it implies a formal\naspect of a being. Unlike Aquinas Dietrich will not allow quiddity to\ndesignate the whole composite, even if the designation is understood\nto be abstract. Strictly speaking, therefore, quiddity is not applied\nto simple beings. Maurer suggests that the reason for this is\nDietrich\u2019s adhering closely to Aristotle who in the seventh book of\nthe Metaphysics maintains that predication with respect to\nquiddity must be of another thing, hence of a composite, because it\nanswers the question why \u201cthis\u201d of \u201cthat\u201d?\nThere must be a \u201cthat\u201d in order meaningfully to ask the\nquestion \u201cwhy this?\u201d In everything having a quiddity it is\nthus necessary that there be a distinction between the quiddity and\nthat which possesses the quiddity.\n\n\nOne consequence of Dietrich\u2019s metaphysics of quiddity is that God and\nwhat the medievals call the \u201cintelligences\u201d do not have\nquiddities since they are simple beings. Aquinas on the other hand\ninsisted that for God essentia, esse and\nquiditas are identical while for all creatures the\nesse is other than the quiddity or the essence. Indeed, this\nis how Aquinas distinguishes a creature from the creator. The essence\nof the creator alone is the same as his act of existing. But, besides\nthe arguments Dietrich has raised against Thomas concerning the lack\nof such identity in creatures Dietrich finds that Aquinas\u2019 system\nfails to properly account for intelligences because as simple beings\nthere is nothing that distinguishes their essence from their act of\nexisting\u2014nothing except their being creatures. But to introduce\ncreaturehood as the distinguishing feature is to render useless the\nimportance of defining creatures in terms of the lack of identity of\ntheir essence and their act of existing. This is not a problem for\nDietrich. For him some creatures are composite, some not, but in both\nsimple and composite beings esse is the same as\nessentia. What remains problematic is the distinction of\nsimple and composite creatures in terms of quiddity. To solve this\nproblem Dietrich turns to the traditional Christian Neoplatonic notion\nof the hierarchy of being.\n5. The Universe of Being\n\n\nDietrich did not devote any one specific work to an analysis of\nhierarchy. However, he makes extensive use of the notion in three\ntreatises in particular: the De animatione caeli, the De\nvisione beatifica, and the De intellectu et\nintelligibili. It is clear from reading these works as well as\nDietrich\u2019s other scientific and philosophical writings in which he\nestablished the nature of the metaphysical elements of esse,\nens, entia, and quiditas that he concerned\nhimself with what might be called the metaphysical structure of\nreality.\n\n\nA consideration that is an ever occurring theme in Dietrich is the\nunity of being, both created and uncreated, a unity he expressed in\nthe term universitas entium, or universe of being. Dietrich\ndoes not tell us why he chooses the term universitas over the\nmore common term universum. Universitas of course\ncan mean \u201cuniversality\u201d so that universitas\nentium would mean the universality of being. But from the\ncontexts in which Dietrich uses the terms such a meaning does not seem\nto be implied. Of course the term was used in the Middle Ages, just as\nit is today, to refer to an institution of higher learning, a\nuniversity. Such an institution traditionally has the goal of turning\n(from the Latin versus) all the disciplines toward one thing\nor one state (unum meaning one), which is wisdom. But to\nrender universitas entium as university of beings with its\nheuristic connotation would have an odd or confusing connotation. But\nthe term universitas can also mean a whole community or a\ncommonality of things. This is very close to the modern term universe\nand it seems to fit the context of Dietrich\u2019s own usage. Consequently,\nwe have rendered Dietrich\u2019s term as universe of beings.\n\n\nBut why did Dietrich insist on this particular term? It is interesting\nto notice that the term is not found in the works of St.  Thomas\nAquinas. Perhaps Dietrich wanted to emphasize that the universe as he\nunderstood it included all beings, even the divine being. For Aquinas,\nuniversum was synonymous with creatura, there being\na radical difference between creative being and created being, a\ndistinction that Aquinas highlights by equating the totality of\ncreated being with the universe. Dietrich, however, does not do\nthis. He wishes to emphasize the unity of being, created and\nuncreated.  There is thus a community, or if you will, a university of\nbeing. And so he most likely used this term universitas to\nexpress this community of being.\n6. The Distinction between God and Creatures\n\n\nHow then does Dietrich distinguish God from creature? We have already\nseen that according to his basic metaphysics Dietrich insists on the\nequation of existence and essence for all beings. The Thomistic\ndistinction of essence and existence will not be permitted. Nor does\nDietrich wish to distinguish God from creatures by postulating a\ntheory of universal hylomorphism, which is the view that all\ncreatures, even spiritual ones, are marked as creatures by the\npossession of some form of materiality. Spiritual creatures, Dietrich\nargues in a question devoted to this topic, possess no form of\nmateriality. How then do we distinguish uncreated being from created\nbeing and the various forms of created being? The answer involves a\nreference to their essential relations to each other in the universe\nof beings, that is by the essential place they occupy in the chain of\nbeings in which every being is essentially ordered to some other being\nas either its cause or its effect. God is at the top of this\nchain. \u201cGod,\u201d Dietrich tells us in the first part of\nDe intellectu et intelligibili, \u201cmeans that\nthan which nothing is superior, which stands in need of nothing with\nrespect to either being or operation.\u201d All other beings are\nordered under God and to each other in an essential ordering. This is\nwhat Dietrich means by place. He does not mean some accidental\nrelation like being to the left or to the right of something\u2014a\nrelation that can change without changing the nature of the being\nenjoying the relation. Hierarchical location for Dietrich is\nessential.  It might be referred to as the dignity of beings, denoting\nthe unique set of relations a being occupies. We can see this concept\nof place or dignity in the definition of God mentioned above: God\nmeans that than which nothing is superior. This description uniquely\ndefines his place in the hierarchy of being. Following an ancient\ntradition Dietrich also tells us that God is called unity and is the\nfirst cause because he is beyond all human language to describe. In\nother words Dietrich identifies God with the ineffable One that he\nfound mentioned in the Liber de causis. But even this\nineffability defines God\u2019s place with respect to the universe of\nbeings.\n\n\nOf course the simplest answer to the question of how God is\ndistinguished from the rest of the universe of beings is in terms of\nGod\u2019s being its creator. Dietrich is careful to preserve the\nphilosophical intention of his exposition when he refers to the\ncreative nature of God within the context of Proclean\nNeoplatonism. God as the One, he says, exhibits an interior\noverflowing (interior transfusio). \u201cBy means of this\nsuper-blessed nature (superbenedicta natura) he overflows\nthrough his own fecundity beyond himself into the whole of being,\nestablishing it out of nothing through creation and governance.\u201d\nThe whole of being then is created out of nothing by God. Dietrich is\ncareful not to say the universe of being because he then would leave\nhimself open to the theological error of implying that God\u2019s being is\ncreated, albeit self-created.  Furthermore, by introducing creation\ninto his hierarchy with respect to the One he avoids the charge of\npantheism that so often plagued earlier Christian Neoplatonists such\nas Scotus Eriugena. Dietrich was perfectly capable of identifying God\nand his creatures as he does in his treatise on measurement, the\nDe mensuris, where he writes, \u201c\u2026all things\ninsofar as they are in him are God himself and he for his part is in a\ncertain way all things\u2026\u201d But he is quick to point out to\nthe reader that the way God is all things is in the mode of an\nessential cause (per modum causae essentialis), meaning that\nwhatever is in the effect, even the being of the effect, is in the\ncause in a more eminent mode. Dietrich explains this principle in the\nsecond part of De intellectu when he tells us that\n\u201c\u2026 an agent as an agent can contain in itself its own act\nor what is caused by it not only virtually, but also essentially,\ninsofar as it is the same as its effect, but with a distinct existence\n(aliud esse).\u201d Thus God and creatures do not enjoy the\nsame being. God\u2019s being is not created, but creative. And this\nproperty is unique to God.  No creatures can create because as a\ncreature it has a non-creative being which is different from God\u2019s\nbeing, an aliud esse.\n\n\nSome creatures have the capacity to produce things, but this is not\nthe same as the power of creation. Here Dietrich is following a\ndistinction he finds in the Liber de causis, where creation\nis understood as the bestowal of being while production is taken to be\na formative causality proper to creatures. The ability to produce or\nreproduce things is vital to Dietrich\u2019s metaphysics of the intellect.\nFor in the order of things intellect comes immediately after God and\nis a mirror of divine omnipotence insofar as it is the universe of\nbeings in the order of knowing; as God can create the totality of\nbeings, the intellect can reflect or reproduce this totality,\nincluding God himself, as ideas.\n7. The Hierarchy of Being\n\n\nDietrich of Freiberg thus presents us with a bifurcated universe of\nbeings, but one that is nonetheless a hierarchy of beings. For he\ndescribes in the very opening words of his De visione\nbeatifica the traditional hierarchy of the Christian Middle Ages,\neven invoking the great authority of Dionysius the Areopagite:\n\n\nWe have it from Saint Dionysius that the universe of beings is\ndivided into the highest, the middle, and the lowest with respect to\nthe disposition of its order; its tripart division being capable of\neven greater distinction in relation to the most general modes and\ngrades of beings. Thus in each of these three divisions there is\nclearly found a higher, a middle, and a lower. This does not go on to\ninfinity, but must reach its limit at two extremes, at something\nhighest on the one hand and something lowest on the other. On these\ndepend the grade and order of all the things located between the two\naccording to the proximity to or distance from these extremes.\n\n\n\n\nR.D. T\u00e9treau calls attention to the fact that the invocation of\nthe Ps-Dionysius is vague and somewhat deceptive. He notes that no\nspecific text of Dionysius is cited. Furthermore the great Church\nFather is not mentioned again throughout the rest of the treatise and\nis not cited at all in the De intellectu and the De\nanimatione caeli. E. Krebs in his study, Meister Dietrich:\nSein Leben, seine Werke, seine Wissenschaft, notices that in the\nDe animatione caeli Dietrich cites Boethius in establishing\nthe procession of beings that marks his hierarchy. Dietrich, he\nargues, identifies himself with a particular school of Neoplatonists\nwhich sees the One as the ultimate and final principle of not only\nhierarchy but of created being itself. This school includes Proclus\nand the author or authors of the Liber de causis.\n\n\nDietrich develops a particular version of the hierarchy of being based\non this Neoplatonic One. By identifying the One of Proclus\u2019\nElements of Theology with the creative God of Christian\ntheology he introduces a dynamic element into the hierarchy of being\nwhereby God brings beings into existence out of nothing and marks them\nwith a resemblance or similitude to himself. The universe is thus like\nGod and each productive being in its hierarchically ordered series of\ncauses is also like God. Dietrich specifically cites propositions 146\nand 147 of Proclus which emphasize the r\u00f4le of similitude in\nthis hierarchy:\n\n\nProp. 146: In the procession of all divine things the ends are\nassimilated to their beginnings, sustaining a circle without beginning\nand without end by turning to the beginning.\n\n\n\nProp. 147: The highest of all the divine orders are assimilated to the\nlast of those positioned above them\n\n\nComment to Prop. 147: For if there must be continuity of the divine\nprocession and each order must be connected by the proper middle terms,\nit is necessary that the highest terms of the secondary ranks be joined\nto the last terms of the first ranks. Conjunction, however, occurs\nthrough likeness. Thus likeness occurs between the first of the lower\nranks and the last of the higher ranks.\n\n\n\nProposition 146 makes it clear that at each stage of the hierarchy of\nbeing the effect is like the cause just as each creature is like\nGod. Furthermore, just as there is a built-in bias, as if were, of an\neffect in relation to its cause in terms of a \u201cturning\u201d to\nits principle, so all creatures have a bias to return to the source or\nprinciple of their being. Proposition 147, along with its comment,\nassures Dietrich that his hierarchy is continuous and that this\ncontinuity is due solely to the likenesses that exist between the\nranks of being. But in addition to assimilating the Proclean doctrine\nof similitude in order to secure continuity of being, Dietrich\nintroduces his own astonishing principle of linkage in the De\nintellectu.  There he identifies the operation of a creature with\nits end. \u201cThis operation,\u201d he tells us, \u201cis the end\nof the thing, for the sake of which the thing exists.\u201d Then he\ngoes on to reveal how he conceives this operation to link one being\nwith another: \u201cBy means of this operation a thing tends beyond\nitself. It is due to this operation that there is found in each thing\nnot only being and truth, but also goodness. Thus each thing is\ninterchangeably being, true, and good.  Consequently, it is a being\nwith respect to itself, true as ordered to the intellect, and good\ninsofar as it actively overflows into something beyond itself.\u201d\nThis is a remarkable view of operation and end. The operation of a\ncreature always lies in moving beyond itself and this is its end or\npurpose. Nothing is static in Dietrich\u2019s universe, everything is\nmoving, attempting to return to its initial principle.  Creatures do\nnot have their end in themselves; everything is for the sake of\nsomething else and that something else is ultimately God.  Insofar as\na creature follows its proper operation it will be led out of itself\nand back to God.\n\n\nThere is something worth pausing and reflecting about here; the\nnatural means of salvation, if you will, are built right into the very\nstructure of things. The opus restaurationis is located\nwithin the opus conditionis. While it initially sounds odd to\nsay that a thing\u2019s operation is its end, the oddness disappears as\nsoon as one realizes that all operations are ultimately reditive. And\nas such they must lead a being beyond itself. One could put it another\nway by saying that for Dietrich the proper operation of every creature\nis to return to God. Dietrich\u2019s use of the Augustinian triad of being,\ntruth and goodness confirms this. A thing\u2019s being gives it\nself-reference and dignity with respect to the hierarchy of being. Its\ntruth gives it reference to intellect, thus opening it up to what\nDietrich calls ens conceptionale, being as conceived by the\nintellect, which in its own way reflects the universe of beings. But\nin its goodness, a thing is like God, overflowing into another,\nimparting itself to those below it in an act which might be called a\ncooperation with the redemption of all things.\n\n\nSimilitude thus gives a dynamic structure to the entire hierarchy of\nbeing and at the same time acts as the essential link between the\nintellect and the rest of the hierarchy. It is thus at one and the\nsame time a principle of being and a principle of knowing. But the\nsimilitude to the whole of being is not something that the intellect\nacquires by some effort on its own part; rather, such similitude is\npart of the very nature of intellect. \u201cOne should\nconsider,\u201d Dietrich remarks in the De intellectu,\n\u201cthat every intellect is a likeness of the whole of being, or of\nbeing as being, and it is such by reason of its essence.\u201d\n8. The Procession and Reversion of Beings\n\n\nIn distinguishing the various kinds of beings that constitute the\nhierarchical universe, Dietrich again follows Proclus. First there is\nGod, Proclus\u2019 One, followed by the intelligences, then souls and\nfinally bodies. Using material found in Proclus, the Liber de\ncausis, and Avicenna\u2019s Metaphysics, Dietrich explains\nthe order of the procession of these four kinds of beings as follows:\nFrom God there proceeds that which is called the first\nintelligence. Here the first stage in the procession has been reached\nand a kind of rank is established which corresponds to the traditional\nno\u00fbs of classical Neoplatonism. From the first\nintelligence the second intelligence flows forth along with the soul\nof the first celestial sphere and the first celestial sphere\nitself. This is the second stage.  Then the process is repeated with\nthe procession of the third intelligence, the soul of the second\nheaven, the second heaven itself, on down through all the celestial\nworlds until the intelligence and soul of the lowest heaven and the\nlowest heaven itself is reached. This intelligence, Dietrich informs\nus, causes the substance of the sublunary beings that undergo\ngeneration and corruption, that is, bodies. Thus all four kinds of\nbeings are accounted for and are ordered according to their place in\nthe celestial procession.\n\n\nThe entire universe of beings is thus in a state of active procession\nof all creatures from God. Each of the four orders of being is in a\ndynamic state, even God when viewed as the creator. God exhibits a\n\u201ccertain interior relational overflowing\u201d which of course\nis his creativity. He establishes the rest of the universe of being\nout of nothing, Dietrich tells us. And at the lowest rank of the order\nof beings, at the level of bodies there is also a dynamic at work. For\nbodies in their natural desire for form are in the process of\nreturning to their source. Consequently there is a hierarchical\nprinciple at work that consists in God who is an eternal outpouring\nwho, being the source of all emanation, has no need to return, bodies\nthat are only in the state of return but have nothing further into\nwhich they can proceed, and intellects and souls that are both in the\nstate of procession and reversion, since they both receive being and\npass it on to those below.\n\n\nDietrich seems to suggest that reditive activity is not found in\nGod. He says that all things are turned back to God, but he does not\nsay that God in any way turns back upon himself. One should remember,\nhowever, that by restricting himself to giving a purely philosophical\naccount of the nature of being and the universe Dietrich was not free\nto speculate theologically about whether exitus or\nreditus had any r\u00f4le to play in the life of the\nTrinity.  That Dietrich is very close to making the commonplace\nidentity of the second hypostasis, the first intelligence, with the\nSecond Person of the Blessed Trinity is hinted at when he talks about\nintellect and desire being the principles of return. Quoting directly\nfrom Proclus he remarks that what is desirable to all things is\nintellect and that all things proceed from intellect as well as return\nthrough it. But he restrains himself from making any theological\nidentity. It is clear, however, that love marks all the ranks of the\nhierarchy, every member of which is driven to return to its source by\ndesire for intellect.  Tacitly he has left the door open for the\ninterpretation that the God who is love as reported in Sacred\nScripture has left the mark of that love in the universe of beings and\nthat intellect (often identified by the earlier Christian\nNeoplatonists with the Second Person of the Trinity) is the crucial\nagent in both the unfolding and retrieval of being.\n9. Conceptional Being\n\n\nThe tie between the intellect and the rest of Dietrich\u2019s universe is\nthus very close. This explains why the treatise on the intellect and\nthe intelligibles is of such importance in understanding his\nmetaphysics and cosmology. The identity of ens reale and\nens conceptionale is essential to the very nature of things\nas Dietrich understands them. Dietrich tells us in the De visione\nbeatifica, that the distinction between conceptional and real\nbeing is the first division of being. Furthermore, conceptional being\nincludes for Dietrich not just the objects of the intellectual act but\nthe act itself. This act is not simply a reception or a reproduction\nin some fashion of an object coming to it from outside, but is what\nmight be called semi-creative, that is, the act of the intellect is\nthe act of conceiving its object. Intellectual conception is analogous\nto the conception of offspring by living things in the sense that a\nnew reality is brought into being. Of course the intellective act is\nalso reproductive, it does establish a mirror of external reality (the\nmeaning of ens reale for Dietrich). T\u00e9treau points out\nthat ens conceptionale is really coextensive with the\nuniverse of beings because it exemplifies in itself all the modes of\nnatural being. That is, intellect exhibits the distinctions of act and\npotency, oneness and multiplicity, cause and effect and so\non. Furthermore, ens conceptionale forms a conceptional\nhierarchy of its own, a hierarchy which mirrors the greater one and at\nthe same time causes and participates in it. At the bottom of this\nconceptional order are the external senses, followed by the interior\nsenses, the discursive power, the possible intellect, and finally the\nagent intellect at the very top.\n\n\nThe procession of creatures in the order of conceptional reality moves\nthrough three modes of being (specific character, ideal form, and\nimage) culminating in beings that are specific in character, and are\nimages, but without the proper character of individuation. These are\nthe intelligences. They proceed from God as an image of God and\nconstitute the very flower of the universe. The agent intellect of\nman, Dietrich tells us, belongs to this mode of being. The various\nmodes of being within the entire hierarchy of being as well as the\nthree kinds of beings subordinate to the first being all bear a\nlikeness to God; indeed, intellect, the very apex of the universe, is\nan image of God.  But the various members of Dietrich\u2019s hierarchy of\nbeing are also bound together into a universe of beings by the\nsimilitude they bear to each other. This similitude, however, is the\nresult of the essential order of causation, according to which every\nbeing in the universe of beings is ordered to every other being either\nas cause or effect. Thus the totality of beings are bound together\nmaking up a universe where every creature bears a relation of\nsimilitude to every other creature and to the primary unifying\nprinciple from which they emanate, God.\n\n\nGod\u2019s power of emanation, which is creative, although simple in its\norigins and principle, is complex in its effects. Divine emanation\ngives rise to the vast complexity of both ens reale and\nens conceptionale. We have already seen that Dietrich viewed\nthis vast complexity as itself a likeness to God\u2014the world in\nall of its wonderful complexity revealed something of God to a mind\nwilling to inquire into it. It gives glory to God in its very\ncomplexity. Perhaps Dietrich\u2019s metaphysical vision of the universe\nexplains his keen interest in science, an interest that led him to\nwrite treatises summing up his research into light and color and into\nthe material elements of the universe. All these things revealed\nsomething of the first cause to him. There was no chasm between his\nmetaphysics and his science. The link between the two is perhaps\ndiscovered in his theory of mind. For it is mind that is most like\nGod. And thus, just as God as first cause is the source of a creative\nemanation so is the intellect.\n\n\nIntellect gives rise to an order of emanation that is just as vast as\nthat of the creative emanation of God in the order of real beings.  In\nfact intellect mirrors this order perfectly. It is itself identified\nwith the universe of beings. Furthermore, it is like God\u2019s creativity\nin that it does not depend upon a pre-existing material substratum\nfrom which ideas are formed by abstraction. But it does depend upon\nGod having made it the kind of being that in the order of\nunderstanding, the ens conceptionale, is able to\n\u201cconceive\u201d being. For no other being except God can do\nthis.\n10. Intellect\n\n\nSo intellect in its similitude to divine creation possesses an\nemanative activity. But in its unlikeness to God and its dependence\nupon him it is a confined or restricted emanation. Dietrich calls this\nemanatio simplex and he claims that it constitutes an analogy\nto the creative emanation of God. Intellect is obviously a crucial\naspect of Dietrich\u2019s metaphysics. It would be well then to say\nsomething about his view of intellect in general before turning\nspecifically to an analysis of his De intellectu.\n\n\nIn the realm of intellects, Dietrich tells us, we discover a fourfold\norder in which intellectual reality stands: at the top of this order\nis found what Dietrich calls intellects existing through their\nessence, followed by intelligent spiritual substances that are called\nangels, and then species and finally the individual realities included\nin species that are known to mind. There are three kinds of intellects\nthat exist through their essence: the separated intelligences,\ncelestial bodies, and human intellects.\n\n\nIntellects possess unique attributes according to Dietrich. We have\nalready remarked on one of these: their likeness to God and to the\nuniverse of beings\u2014a property shared by no other creatures. We have\nseen that intellect is like God in that it is what we have called\nsemi-creative or conceptional. In what way, however, can intellect be\nthe likeness of the universe of beings, and to such a degree that it\nbecomes identified with it so that we can say that the intellect is\nthe universe of beings in the order of ens conceptionale? One\ncould answer of course by saying that the intellect is this likeness\nby its very act of knowing the universe of beings. But there is a\ndifficulty here\u2014one that Dietrich is well aware of from studying\nAristotle. For the question how the intellect knows the universe of\nbeings is like the question how the eye can see colors. If the eye\nwere any one particular color, then it would see only that\ncolor. Aristotle, who raises this question, replies that the eye must\nbe colorless so it can see every color. Likewise for the mind or\nintellect. Thus it is wrong to say that the intellect is the likeness\nof the universe of beings by its very act of knowing the universe of\nbeings because the very reverse is true. The intellect is no one of\nthe beings it knows.  It is truly the universe of beings, but in the\nconceptional order. Thus it can be like the universe of beings in the\nso-called real order. Its nature then must be general and\nuniversal. Noting its object provides evidence for this:\n\n\nThe intellect is a general and universal nature in accord with the\nproperty of its intellectual essence, which is not determined to\nunderstand only this or that thing. This is clear from its object,\nwhich is not this or that quiddity, but universally any quiddity and\nbeing as being, that is, whatever possesses the character of\nbeing.\n\n\n\n\nOne should notice that Dietrich does not raise a question which may\nappear obvious: if the intellect is not identified with any one being,\nis it proper to call it a being at all? Nor does he formally consider\nthe hypothesis that Meister Eckhart advanced in his Quaestiones\nparisienses, namely that intellect might belong to a different\norder than being. But, of course, this is just where the answer lies.\nThe intellect belongs to a different order of reality than being. In\neffect, Dietrich\u2019s categories of ens reale and ens\nconceptionale imply as much. In fact, the way Dietrich uses the\nnotion of ens conceptionale as a superior mode of reality is\nexactly the position Eckhart takes.\n11. The Resplendence of the Intellect\n\n\nDue to its superiority and to the fact that it is no being, the\nintellect is resplendent with the universe of beings. \u201cAll\nbeings shine forth (resplendent) in its essence,\u201d he\nsays. One must be careful here, however, not to misunderstand what\nDietrich means by beings \u201cshining forth\u201d. He is not\nadvocating a doctrine of divine illumination of the intellect. To be\nsure this phrase might be rendered \u201cAll beings are\nintellectually illuminated in its essence,\u201d and then interpreted\nto mean that Dietrich holds some doctrine of divine illumination for\nthe intellect. When Albertus Magnus refers to resplendence it is\nusually safe to construe what he says in terms of some form of divine\nillumination. But this will not do for Dietrich of Freiberg. He simply\ndoes not hold a doctrine of illumination\u2014at least not in the sense\nthat Albert or other earlier medieval philosophers did. Martin\nGrabmann made the observation many years ago that the doctrine of\ndivine illumination was used less and less as the 13th Century drew to\na close. Dietrich shows evidence of disavowing the doctrine in his\nphilosophical study of the intellect and its normal operations. In the\npassage mentioned above we have to clearly understand that Dietrich is\ntrying to say that the intellect reflects all things\u2014they shine\nforth in it, not because the intellect is undergoing an act of divine\nillumination, but because in the order of ens conceptionale\nthe things are in the intellect first as conceptions and are\nexemplified there as part of the nature of intellect. The conclusion\nthat Dietrich wishes to draw is that the intellect, being always in\nact through its essence, contains in itself the whole universe of\nbeings, which shine forth from it into the cosmos.\n\n\nDietrich makes a very interesting and important application of this\ndoctrine of the resplendence of the intellect. Man, according to\nDietrich, is cut off from his own intellect. He does not explain why\nthis is, but no doubt it involves the theological doctrine of the\nfall.  He does say, however, that man is not fully joined to his\nintellect, an intellect that is always in act and resplendent with the\nuniverse of beings. Were he to be fully joined to his intellect, were\nthe intellect to become man\u2019s form, then man would understand\neverything all at once.  This, Dietrich suggests, is exactly what\nhappened in the famous vision of St. Benedict in which he saw the\nwhole universe.\n12. Empirical and Transempirical Consciousness\n\n\nDoes the disassociation of man from his intellect mean that human\nbeings have knowledge of which they are unaware? How is this possible\ngiven that the intellect has the property of consciousness? After all,\nit does not make any sense to say that one knows something of which he\nis totally unaware. And yet this is precisely what Dietrich claims.\nBurkhard Mojsisch draws attention to the fact that in identifying the\nagent intellect with the abditum mentis (the hiddenness of\nthe mind) of St. Augustine Dietrich establishes a distinction between\nwhat Mojsisch calls \u201ctransempirical consciousness\u201d and\nempirical consciousness. Mojsisch argues that Dietrich held such a\nposition because it is the agent intellect itself that grounds\nempirical consciousness. Since empirical consciousness is the function\nof the possible intellect according to Dietrich, and since in his\nNeoplatonic hierarchy the agent intellect being the cause of the\npossible intellect must be superior to it, it follows that empirical\nconsciousness is due to the causal action of the agent\nintellect. Although this is not the place to pursue a detailed\nphilosophical analysis of Dietrich\u2019s theory, it should be\npointed out that his position fits the facts of common sense and is\nconcordant with some contemporary theories of mind. We surely maintain\nthat we know things that we are unaware of when we are, for example,\nasleep or simply not thinking of them at the moment but could recall\nthem from memory. Peter Geach in his book Mental Acts\ndevelops an analysis of concepts as capacities that are exercised or\nconsciously manifest themselves in acts of judgment. And capacities,\none could argue, need not be continuously exercised to be\ncapacities. Thus it is with regard to Dietrich\u2019s theory of the\nagent intellect; it need not always and everywhere be completely\noperative upon the possible intellect. Indeed, it can remain a\n\u201chiddenness of the mind\u201d for the entirety of a\nperson\u2019s life and still be a reality about the person. Anyone\nwho has ever had the dubious privilege of teaching in a modern\nuniversity knows this to be a truism that borders on the obvious.\n13. The Agent Intellect and the Soul\n\n\nDietrich\u2019s account of the relationship of consciousness to the agent\nintellect in terms of causation raises another question for his theory\nof intellect, namely, what kind of causal relationship exists between\nthe agent intellect and the soul? Dietrich gives a very precise answer\nto this question based no doubt on his acceptance of Proclus\u2019\nexposition of the principles of generation within the hierarchy of\nbeing. The agent intellect, according to this explanation, is the\nintrinsic efficient cause of the soul. That it cannot be the material\ncause Dietrich thinks is self-evident. It cannot be the final cause\nsince a final cause perfects a thing, but does not establish it in\nbeing, which is what the agent intellect does for the soul. But it is\nmore important to understand, Dietrich insists, that the agent\nintellect cannot be the formal cause of the soul\u2014at least not in the\nnatural order of things. He argues that if it was the formal cause of\nthe soul, given that the soul by definition is the formal cause of the\nhuman person, then it would follow that there would be a form of a\nform in the same genus, man. But this is contrary to the natural order\nof things because whatever is the form of something in the genus of\nsubstance is by the whole of itself the act of its subject. Thus the\nsame thing cannot be in potency to more than one form in its genus.\nPerhaps we can understand Dietrich\u2019s remarks about the vision of St.\nBenedict mentioned above in terms of this analysis. Man is not\n\u201cfully joined\u201d to his intellect in the sense that the\nintellect is not his form. If it were his form, he, like Benedict,\nwould understand the entire universe of beings in a single mental\nact. But such a vision belongs to the order of grace, not to the order\nof natural providence.\n\n\nThe soul of man, then, living in time, only participates in its agent\nintellect. It acquires the universe of beings only piecemeal as it\nwere. More and more with each act of understanding it approaches the\nunderstanding of the universe of beings, a universe that is its\nuniverse, which it possesses as a capacity of its own nature.\n14. The Separation of the Intellect\n\n\nThe causal relationship that the agent intellect enjoys with respect\nto the soul of man raises one last question for Dietrich: to what\nextent if any is the intellect separated in its existence from man?\nThis question of course had been debated in the schools by the\ngeneration of scholars that immediately preceded Dietrich. But it was\nstill a question that attracted attention in his own day. There were\nphilosophers then, as there probably always will be, who wanted to\nargue that the intellect was a function of the soul, having no\nexistence outside of the soul. Dietrich, however, basing his position\nsquarely upon an old Augustinian tradition, argued just the opposite.\nSeparation is a characteristic of intellect as such, and in man it is\nidentified with the \u201cinteriority\u201d which Augustine claimed\nwas not joined to the body as its form. T\u00e9treau points out that\nDietrich never attempts to prove his doctrine of separation, but\nassumes it on the basis of a passage in Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima (III, 5, 430a17\u201318) where Aristotle claims that mind\nand its act of thought cannot be subjected to temporality. This,\nhowever, is not exactly accurate. It has already been shown that\nDietrich has in mind Augustine\u2019s notion of a separate\ninteriority in man that he identifies with his agent intellect. But\nthe fact that Dietrich does not offer a proof for his doctrine is not\ndue to his appeal to the authority of Aristotle and Augustine. Rather,\nas Mojsisch shows, the separation of the intellect is due to its\nessential intellectuality. Since Dietrich claims that the agent\nintellect is intellect through its own essence, he need not\ndemonstrate its property of separateness when it acts as efficient\ncause of the human soul. Separateness is a property of its essential\nintellectuality.\n15. Conclusion\n\n\nOn the basis of the survey of Dietrich of Freiberg just given one\nmight surmise that his philosophy in general is consummated in his\ndoctrine of intellect. Such a conclusion, however, would not be\nstrictly correct. Although Krebs in his study of Dietrich concludes\nthat the theory of the intellect was the culmination of his entire\nphilosophical project, William Wallace has shown that Dietrich\u2019s\nqualitative methodology, especially as applied in his optical studies,\nis a valuable contribution to scientific methodology, a fact that can\nbe appreciated independently of his theory of the intellect. It is\nalso possible to argue that his contribution to the discussion\nconcerning the metaphysical status of essence and existence in\ncreatures can be understood without reference to his analysis of\nintellect. And yet one would not wish to undervalue the importance of\nDietrich\u2019s doctrine of mind not only in terms of his own philosophical\nenterprise but also in terms of its influence on the later course of\nmedieval German philosophy, beginning with Meister Eckhart and ending\nwith Nicholas Cusanus.\n\n\nKurt Flasch attempts to put Dietrich\u2019s contributions to the philosophy\nof mind in its proper perspective. To see what Dietrich has\naccomplished we must try to understand how he introduces a new element\ninto medieval scholastic speculations concerning mind. To begin with,\nFlasch notes, Dietrich\u2019s distinction between ens reale and\nens conceptionale replaces the old scholastic distinction\nbetween ens naturae and ens rationis in such a way\nthat it is no longer possible to claim that being as found in the mind\nis dependent upon extra-mental reality. Where Thomas Aquinas claimed\nan exclusive distinction between the two categories of being, Dietrich\nwith his doctrine of coextentionality insists on an inclusive\ndistinction. The result of this new perspective on the priority of\nens conceptionale, Flasch argues, not only grounds a new\nmetaphysics but also establishes a new methodology for studying nature\nbased upon an inclusive understanding of natural being. Looked at in\nthis way Dietrich\u2019s theory of mind can indeed be seen as the\nculmination of his philosophy.\n",
