    "main_text": "Historical Background || Intellectual Background\n1.2 Intellectual Background\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s political thought draws from a number of sources,\nboth classical and modern. As one commentator puts it, \u201cSpinoza\nformed new conclusions from facts and concepts borrowed from\nothers\u201d (Haitsma Mulier 1980, 170). It is worth briefly\nconsidering some of the sources of the \u201cfacts and concepts\u201d\nthat he inherits.\n\n\nAt some point in the mid-1650\u2019s (around the time of his\ncherem, or excommunication) Spinoza began studying Latin with\nFranciscus Van den Enden. Van den Enden was an ex-Jesuit and radical\negalitarian with revolutionary tendencies. He was put to death in 1674\nafter having been found guilty of conspiring to depose Louis XIV in\norder to establish a free republic in Normandy. Van dan Enden was an\nanti-clerical democrat who appears to have profoundly influenced\nSpinoza. One commentator has gone so far as to call Van den Enden\n\u201cthe genius behind Spinoza,\u201d claiming that Van den\nEnden\u2019s writings \u201ccontain a political theory which is in\nfact the same as the one worked out by Spinoza\u201d (Klever 1996,\n26). Whether or not this assessment is fair, it is clear that\nSpinoza\u2019s thinking was nourished through his association with Van\nden Enden and the larger radical Cartesian circle in Amsterdam (Nyden-Bullock 2007).\n\n\nHobbes\u2019 influence on Spinoza is unmistakable. We know that\nSpinoza read De Cive carefully and that it was among his\npossessions when he died in 1677. He might also have read\nLeviathan, which appeared in Latin in 1668, as Spinoza was\ncompleting the TTP (Sacksteder\n1980). I will discuss Spinoza\u2019s work in relationship to\nHobbes\u2019 in some detail below (sections 2.1 and 2.2, below). Here\nI want to mention the impact of Dutch Hobbesians on Spinoza. Hobbesian\nthought was introduced into Dutch political discourse by Lambert van\nVelthuysen, an anti-clerical, liberal physician (Tuck 1979; Blom 1995).\nVelthuysen\u2019s Dissertatio is an unabashed defense of\nHobbes\u2019 thought, in which the duty to preserve oneself is given\npride of place (esp. Sect. XIII). Spinoza read and admired Velthuysen\nas a \u201cman of exceptional sincerity of mind,\u201d and was thus\ndisconcerted when Velthuysen denounced the TTP as the work of\na dangerous atheist (Epistles 42 and 43).\n\n\nAside from Velthuysen, the other primary Dutch conduits for\nHobbesian thought prior to Spinoza were the De la Court brothers (Petry\n1984; Kossmann 2000). Most of the De la Courts\u2019 writings were\npublished by Pieter De la Court after the death of his brother Johan in\n1660. However, because it remains unclear how much Pieter added and how\nmuch he took credit for the work his studious younger brother, I will refer to\nthese authors of these writings simply as the De la Courts, so as to\navoid attribution problems. The De la Courts were ardent republicans\nwho maintained good relations with Johan De Witt. Indeed, De Witt is\nthought to have written two chapters in the second edition of their\nbook Interest van Holland (see Petry 1984, 152). The De la\nCourts adopted the basic features of Hobbesian anthropology, but\neschewed juridical concepts like \u201cright\u201d and\n\u201ccontract\u201d (see Malcolm 1991, 548), opting to analyze the\ncivil condition in terms of the competing interests of participants.\nAccording to them, the aim of the state is to ensure that the interests\nof rulers are tied to the interests of the ruled, which is possible\nonly if one adopts a series of institutional measures, such as the use\nof blind balloting, the removal of hereditary posts, and the rotation\nof offices. Republics, they argued, will be marked by greater checks\nagainst self-interested legislation than monarchies (see Blom 1993).\nSpinoza evidently studied these works carefully; his institutional\nrecommendations in the Tractatus Politicus [hereafter: TP]\nreflect his debt to the De la Courts (Petry 1984; Haitsma Mulier\n1980).\n\n\nIt was likely the writings of the De la Courts that impressed upon\nSpinoza the perspicacity of Niccolo Machiavelli. The notion of\nbalancing the interests of competing parties was ultimately derived\nfrom Machiavelli (see Haitsma Mulier 1993, 254\u2013255). Spinoza\u2019s\nPolitical Treatise is shot through with Machiavellian insights\nand recommendations. Right at the outset of the work, Spinoza parrots\nMachiavelli\u2019s critique of utopian theorizing, elevating statesmen\nover philosophers, since only the latter begin with a realistic\nconception of human psychology (TP 1/1; cf. Machiavelli,\nThe Prince I.15). Machiavellian realism pervades Spinoza\u2019s\npolitical writings, playing a particularly significant role in the\nconstitutional theorizing of the TP. Spinoza, like Machiavelli,\nunderstood that prescriptions for improving the governance of a state\ncan be offered only after one has a proper diagnosis of the problems\nand a proper grasp of human nature (see Steinberg 2018a).\n",
