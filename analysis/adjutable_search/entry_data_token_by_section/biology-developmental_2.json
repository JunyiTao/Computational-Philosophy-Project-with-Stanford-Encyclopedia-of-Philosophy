    "main_text": "Overview || Developmental Mechanisms\n1.3 Developmental Mechanisms\n\nA developmental mechanism is a mechanism or process that\noperates during ontogeny (see McManus 2012 for discussion). At least\ntwo different types of developmental mechanisms can be distinguished\n(Love 2017a): molecular genetic mechanisms (signaling or gene\nregulatory networks;\n Section 3.1)\n and cellular-physical mechanisms (cell migration or epithelial\ninvagination;\n Section 3.2).\n Philosophical explorations of mechanisms in science and mechanistic\nexplanation have grown dramatically over the past two decades (Craver\nand Darden 2013; Glennan and Illari 2017; Illari and Williamson 2012).\nAmong different accounts of scientific mechanisms, four shared\nelements are discernable: (1) what a mechanism is for, (2) its\nconstituents, (3) its organization, and, (4) the spatiotemporal\ncontext of its operation. Developmental explanations seek to\ncharacterize these four elements through various experimental\ninterventions. Together these elements provide a template for\ncharacterizing the two different types of developmental\nmechanisms.\n\nA well-established molecular genetic mechanism is the initial\nformation of segments in Drosophila due to the segment polarity\nnetwork of gene expression (Wolpert et al. 2010, 70-81; Damen 2007).\nBy Stage 8 of development (~3 hours post-fertilization),\nDrosophila embryos have 14 parasegment units that were defined\nby pair-rule gene expression in earlier stages. The transcription\nfactor Engrailed accumulates in the anterior portion of each\nparasegment. This initiates a cascade of gene activity that defines\nthe boundaries of each compartment of cells that will eventually\nbecome a segment. One element of this activity is the expression of\nhedgehog, a secreted signaling protein, in cells anterior to\nthe band of cells where Engrailed has accumulated, which marks the\nposterior boundary of each nascent segment. This, in turn, activates\nthe expression of wingless, another secreted signaling protein,\nwhich maintains the expression of both engrailed and\nhedgehog in a feedback loop so that segment boundaries persist\n (Figure 4).\n The segment polarity network exhibits all four of the shared elements\nof a mechanism. It is constituted by a number of parts (e.g.,\nEngrailed, Wingless, Hedgehog) and activities or component operations\n(e.g., signaling proteins bind receptors, transcription factors bind\nto DNA and initiate gene expression), which are organized into\npatterns of interacting relationships (feedback loops, signaling\npathways) within a spatiotemporal context (in parasegments of the\nDrosophila embryo, ~3 hours post-fertilization) so as to\nproduce a specific behavior or phenomenon (a set of distinct segments\nwith well-defined boundaries).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Wingless and Hedgehog\nreciprocal signaling during segmentation of Drosophila\nembryos.\n\n\nNext, consider the cellular-physical mechanism of branching\nmorphogenesis, which refers to combinations of cellular proliferation\nand movement that yield branch-like structures in kidneys, lungs,\nglands, or blood vessels. There are many types of branching\nmorphogenesis, but one primary mechanism is epithelial folding, which\ninvolves cells invaginating at different locations on a structure to\nyield branches (Davies 2013, ch. 20). Different cellular-physical\nmechanisms can produce invaginations that lead to branching structures\n(Varner and Nelson 2014): the constriction of one end of a subset of\ncolumnar cells in an epithelium (\u201capical constriction\u201d);\nincreased cell proliferation of one epithelial sheet in relation to\nanother (\u201cdifferential growth\u201d); and compression of an\nepithelium leading to periodic invaginations (\u201cmechanical\nbuckling\u201d). That different mechanisms can lead to the same\nmorphological outcome means it can be difficult to discern which\nmechanism is operating in an embryonic context. Branching\nmorphogenesis also exhibits all four of the shared elements of a\nmechanism. The parts are cells and tissues with activities or\ncomponent operations (e.g., apical constriction, differential growth,\nmechanical buckling) being organized into patterns of interacting\nrelationships (apical constriction leading to epithelial invagination)\nwithin a spatiotemporal context (in tracheal precursors within the\nDrosophila embryo around Stage 7 and 8). This organization\nproduces a specific behavior or phenomenon (a set of branching\nstructures\u2014the trachea).\n\nOnce these types of developmental mechanisms have been distinguished,\nseveral conceptual issues become salient. The first pertains to how\nthe two types of mechanisms are interrelated during ontogeny, and how\ndifferent investigative approaches do or do not successfully provide\nintegrated accounts of them\n (Section 3.3).\n A second is their distinct patterns of generality. Molecular genetic\nmechanisms are widely conserved across phylogenetically disparate taxa\nas a consequence of evolutionary descent, whereas cellular-physical\nmechanisms are widely instantiated as a consequence of shared physical\norganization but not due to evolutionary descent (Love 2017a). The\ndivergence of these patterns has prompted explicit epistemological\nreflection by developmental\n biologists.[3]\n",
