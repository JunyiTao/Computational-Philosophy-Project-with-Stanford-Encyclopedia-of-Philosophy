Subsequent models, based on different\nframeworks, sought to examine whether polarization can emerge even if\nall agents are truth-seekers, that is, rational agents who form their\nopinions only in view of epistemic considerations.\n\nFor example, a model by Singer et al. (2019) shows the emergence of\npolarization in groups of deliberating agents who share reasons for\ntheir beliefs, and who merely use a coherence-based approach to manage\ntheir limited memory (by forgetting those reasons that conflict with\nthe view supported by most of their previous considerations). Using\nthe Bayesian modeling framework Laputa, Olsson (2013) shows how\npolarization can emerge over the course of deliberation if agents\nassign different degrees of trust to the testimony of others,\ndepending on how similar views they hold. In another Bayesian\nframework based on bandit models, O\u2019Connor and Weatherall (2018)\nshow how a community of scientists who share not only their testimony,\nbut unbiased evidence, can end up in a polarized state if they treat\nevidence obtained by other scientists, whose beliefs are too far off\nfrom their own, as uncertain. Moreover, Michelini, Osorio and\ncolleagues (forthcoming) combine bandit models with the\nbounded-confidence framework to study polarization in communities that\ndisagree on the diagnostic value of evidence for a certain hypothesis\n(modeled by the Bayes factor). Their results indicate that an initial\ndisagreement on the diagnosticity of evidence can lead to\npolarization, depending on the sample size of the performed studies\nand the confidence interval within which scientists share their\nopinions.\n\nPolarization in epistemic communities has also been studied by ABMs\nsimulating argumentative dynamics. For example, using the framework by\nBetz (2013), Kopecky (2022) proposes a model that shows how certain\nways in which rational agents engage in argumentative exchange in an\nopen debate forum can result in polarized communities, even if agents\ndon\u2019t have a preference for whom they argue with.\n",
