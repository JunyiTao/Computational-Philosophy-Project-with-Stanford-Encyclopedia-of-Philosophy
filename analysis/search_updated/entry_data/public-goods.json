    "preamble": "\n\nThe government plays a significant role in providing goods such as\nnational defence, infrastructure, education, security, and fire and\nenvironmental protection almost everywhere. These goods are often\nreferred to as \u201cpublic goods\u201d. Public goods are of\nphilosophical interest because their provision is, to varying degrees,\nessential to the smooth functioning of society\u2014economically,\npolitically, and culturally\u2014and because of their close\nconnection to problems concerning the regulation of externalities and\nthe free-rider problem. Without infrastructure and their protection\ngoods cannot be exchanged, votes cannot be cast, and it would be\nharder to enjoy the fruits of cultural production. There is widespread\nagreement among political philosophers that some level of education is\nrequired for democracy to be effective. Due to their connection to\nexternalities and the free-rider problem, the provision of public\ngoods raises profound economic and ethical issues.\n\nAs we will see in Section 1, the economic definition of a public good\nhas little to do with whether these goods are provided by the public\nor by private enterprises but with certain abstract features that are\nshared by many different goods, only some of which are regularly\nproduced publicly. The abstract features economists use in their\ndefinition depend on technology, values and tastes, making boundaries\ncontested and shifting over time. Section 2 will introduce the notion\nof an externality, and in Section 3 the standard neoclassical welfare\neconomic analysis of public goods will be examined. Section 4 looks at\nthe private provision of public goods. Section 5 offers a review of\nrecent experimental work on public goods (which challenges the\nstandard analysis to some extent). Section 6, finally, discusses some\nethical arguments relevant to the provision of public goods.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Defining Public Goods and Distinguishing Between Different Kinds of Public Goods\n1.1 Non-Rivalry and Non-Excludability\n\nEven though Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson is usually credited with\nhaving introduced the theory of public goods to modern economics\n(e.g., in Sandmo 1989), the origins of the idea go back to John Stuart\nMill, Ugo Mazzola (an Italian writer on public finance), and the\nSwedish economist Knut Wicksell (Blaug 1985: 218\u20139 and\n596\u20137]). Samuelson defined what he called a \u201ccollective\nconsumption good\u201d as:\n\n\n[a good] which all enjoy in common in the sense that each\nindividual\u2019s consumption of such a good leads to no subtractions\nfrom any other individual\u2019s consumption of that good\u2026.\n(Samuelson 1954: 387)\n\n\nIn the contemporary debate, this feature or characteristic of goods is\nusually referred to as \u201cnon-rivalry\u201d. A good is rivalrous\nif and only if an individual\u2019s consumption of it diminishes\nothers\u2019 ability to consume it. Bob\u2019s consumption of a\ngrain of rice makes it impossible for Sally to consume the same grain\nof rice. By contrast, Sally\u2019s enjoyment of Bruckner\u2019s\nSymphony No. 9 in no way diminishes Bob\u2019s ability to do the\nsame. Rice is thus rivalrous while music is\n not.[1]\n\n\nA few years after Samuelson, Richard Musgrave introduced an\nalternative criterion, that of (non-) excludability (Musgrave 1959).\nAs the name suggests, a good is excludable if and only if it is\npossible to prevent individuals from consuming it, to \u201cdraw a\nfence around it\u201d as it were. Land is thus a good that is\nconsidered excludable, while streetlight is not excludable: if Bob\npays for a streetlight to be installed, he cannot stop his neighbour\nSally from benefitting from it.\n\nIn contemporary economics, goods are usually defined as public goods\nif and only if they are both non-rivalrous and non-excludable\n(e.g., Varian 1992: 414). Rivalrous and excludable goods are called\nprivate goods. National defence is a paradigmatic example of a public\ngood. Not only does Sally\u2019s consumption of national defence not\nreduce Bob\u2019s consumption; she could not prevent him from\nconsumption if she tried. Food, clothes and flats are paradigmatic\nexamples of private goods.\n\nThere are also goods that are rivalrous and non-excludable and goods\nthat are non-rival and excludable. The former are sometimes called\n\u201ccommon pool resources\u201d (e.g., V. Ostrom & E. Ostrom\n1977, E. Ostrom et al. 1994; E. Ostrom 2003). An example is fish\nstocks. The latter are sometimes called \u201cclub goods\u201d\n(e.g., Mankiw 2012: 219; see also Buchanan 1965). Examples include\nwatching a movie in a cinema and the services provided by social and\nreligious associations.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the different types of goods that have\nbeen distinguished so far.\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nRivalrous\nNon-rivalrous\n\nExcludable\nPrivate goods (homesteads, bathroom cleaner)\nClub goods (Sports clubs, movie theatres)\n\nNon-excludable\nCommon resource goods (fish stocks)\nPublic goods: local (fire protection), national (national defence),\nglobal (climate mitigation measures), partial (parades)\n\nTable 1: Different kinds of economic goods\n\n1.2 Porous Boundaries\n\nThe boundaries between these different types of goods are neither\nsharp nor fixed. For example, whether or not Bob\u2019s enjoyment of\na movie in a theatre is affected by Sally\u2019s watching the movie\nin the same theatre at the same time depends on Bob\u2019s values or\ntastes as well as details of the context. Sally might sit in front of\nBob and partially block his view. Or she might be one of those people\nwho sits right next to you even though fifty other seats are\navailable. Or Bob might be bothered by anyone sitting in the same\ntheatre at the same time, or enjoy watching the movie together with\nothers. Thus, even supposing that Sally doesn\u2019t alter\nBob\u2019s viewing of the movie as such, her presence can have a\npositive or negative effect on Bob\u2019s enjoyment of it. Thus,\nwhether or not a good is rivalrous in consumption depends on many\ncontextual details and not just the nature of the good alone.\n\nThe same good can be excludable at one time, but non-excludable at\nanother, or excludable in one society, but non-excludable in another.\nFor example, radio broadcasts used to be a public good because it was\nnot (easily) possible to prevent individuals from tuning in, but this\nis no longer the case in the digital age. But technology is only part\nof the story. A particular plot of land\u2014a prime example of a\nprivate good\u2014can be protected by building a fence around it. But\nthere is no fence that cannot be overcome. In reality, a fence is more\nlike a signal indicating that the owner prefers to keep others out, or\nit makes it more costly for them to do so. What matters for the\ncharacterisation of land as a private good is that the landowner has\nthe right to stop potential trespassers and that this right\nwill be enforced by the legal system. Of course, which sets of rights\nare attached to property depends on the norms prevailing in a society.\nProperty rights are never absolute (property in a chain saw gives me\nthe right to use it to cut my own trees but not to cut my\nneighbour\u2019s trees, much less to use it to hurt anyone), and\nalways the result of past negotiations.\n\nTo give a silly example, not everyone enjoys the sight of\n(particularly, white) socks in sandals. In our society, the sight of\nsocks in sandals is something individuals have to endure because it is\nconsidered to be within the rights of the owners of white socks that\nthey can wear them in public, in sandals or in other types of shoes.\nIt is easy, however, to imagine societies that define the rights of\nsock-owners differently and value the tastes of those who are bothered\nby the blight of socks in sandals more highly. Indeed, even in modern\nliberal societies social norms regulate what is decent to wear in\npublic. Since a good\u2019s degree of excludability depends in part\non property rights, and what property rights entail may differ between\nsocieties and, within societies, may change over time, a good\u2019s\nexcludability may differ between societies and change over time. \n\nAnother, related aspect is that the cost of enforcing property rights\ndiffers between cases, partly for technological, partly for legal and\npolitical reasons. That automobiles are private goods depends on the\nrelatively cheap availability of suitable locks and also on the fact\nthat the government enforces property rights in automobiles. If the\nprice of locks were higher, or the government made it illegal to\nsecure one\u2019s car using a lock, or the government stopped\nprosecuting theft, automobiles would be \u201cnon-excludable\u201d\n(Demsetz 1964).\n\nA corollary of the non-excludability characteristic is that there are\nlimitations to consumers\u2019 consumption decisions regarding the\npublic good, if it is produced. Individuals might have different\npreferences for the level of security provided by national defence,\nbut once national defence is in place, they will consume the level\nthat has been produced, not more or less of it. One cannot \u201copt\nout\u201d of the consumption of a public good. Similarly, while\neveryone might like clean air, individuals will differ in their degree\nof tolerance of pollution. But once \u201cclean air\u201d has been\nproduced, consumers must consume it independently of their\npreferences.\n\nIt has been suggested that the \u201cpublic\u201d nature of a public\ngood may be an effect of its provision by the public rather\nthan its cause (Cowen 1992: 6 credits unpublished work from 1987 by\nBoudewijn Bouckaert). If a good is provided by government, private actors\nhave no reason to develop technologies that allow the exclusion of\nnon-paying individuals. Accordingly, public investment in the good\nthereby makes a good that could be private a public good. Even if this\nidea is mistaken, it illustrates the fact that the boundary between\nprivate and public goods is not fixed because what is technologically\npossible depends in part on investment in research and\ndevelopment.\n\nThe physical characteristics of a good, then, together with the\ncontext of its consumption, values, tastes, legal, moral and social\nnorms as well as technological possibilities determine the proper\ncategorisation of a good as a private, common pool, club, or public\ngood.\n1.3 Different Kinds of Public Goods\n\nDistinctions can also be drawn among public goods. Most\npublic goods do not affect all inhabitants of a large community\nequally. Fire protection services in Lower Manhattan are not consumed\nby those living in the Bronx, much less by Californians. Public parks\nbenefit those who live in the neighbourhood, playgrounds only those\nwho live in the neighbourhood and have children of a certain age (and\nindeed they might constitute a public bad for others). Charles Tiebout\nhas developed a theory of local government, after which the\nterm \u201clocal public good\u201d was coined (Tiebout 1956,\nStiglitz 1982). Other public goods may benefit all of humanity, such\nas climate change mitigation. We can therefore distinguish\nlocal, national, and global public goods\n(on the latter, see Kaul et al. 2003).\n\nA partial public good is one from whose consumption some\nindividuals can be excluded but not others. Mancur Olson gives the\nexample of a parade that is a public good for those living in tall\nbuildings overlooking the parade route but a private good to those who\nneed to buy a ticket for a seat in the stands along the way (Olson\n1971: 14). A full public good, by contrast, is one from whose\nconsumption all individuals can be excluded.\n1.4 Examples of Public Goods\n\nThe following are examples of goods that are typically regarded as\npublic goods:\n\n Security. National defence has already been mentioned as\nan example. More generally, the ability to live safely and peacefully\nin a neighbourhood, city, region, or country (for instance, through\npolice and armed forces) is considered a public good because it is\ndifficult to exclude any inhabitant of the protected area from\nbenefitting from the protection and one inhabitant\u2019s enjoyment\nof protection does not generally diminish other inhabitants\u2019\nequal enjoyment.\n Education and science. The public goods character of\neducation and science is somewhat more subtle. It is easily possible\nto exclude individuals from being schooled, and so \u201chaving an\nMIT engineering degree\u201d is a private good. However, the more\neducated the general population is, the more individuals benefit from\nthis general education\u2014independently of how much they invest (or\nthe public invests) in their own education\u2014in a manner that is\nnon-excludable and non-rivalrous. A better educated population makes\nit easier for businesses to thrive, and everybody profits from a\nthriving economy, not only those who are well-educated. It is\ndifficult to exclude individuals from a thriving economy and a given\nindividual\u2019s benefit is not diminished by anybody else\u2019s\nbenefit. Scientific ideas are also considered to be public goods\n(Boldrin & Levine 2008). Once an idea (such as a scientific\ntheory) has been created it is difficult to exclude individuals from\nbenefitting (unless the idea is protected by a patent, see below), and\nindividuals\u2019 benefit is non-rivalrous. It is important to\ndistinguish between the idea and its physical manifestation. The idea\nof a steam engine is a public good, whereas particular steam engines\nare both excludable and rivalrous.\n Infrastructure. Though infrastructure is often referred\nto as a public good (e.g., OECD 2016), whether the classification is\ncorrect depends on the details of the specific kind of infrastructure\nand technology. Paradigmatic examples of infrastructure are often not\npublic goods. Roads and motorways are excludable, as the existence of\ntoll roads attests. If the toll for a private road is sufficiently\nlow, it can be rivalrous as well due to congestion. The same can be\nsaid about the internet. A traditional lighthouse is more likely to\nhave public-goods character, though depending on the physical nature\nof the signal it sends, it may well be excludable (Varian 1992: 415).\nThe reason many commentators classify infrastructure as a public good\nis that it tends to lead to positive externalities. The (close)\nrelationship between public goods and externalities is explained\nbelow.\n Environment. Clean air is a paradigmatic good, at least\noutside. Without massive infringements of an individual's rights it is\nvirtually impossible to exclude him or her from benefitting from clean\nair. And outside of narrowly enclosed spaces, clean air is non-rival.\nSimilarly with the absence of littering. If I decide not to litter, I\ncannot easily prevent you from enjoying the clean space, and your\nenjoyment of it does not reduce anyone else\u2019s.\n Public health. Individuals benefit from a healthy\npopulation in a variety of ways. For example, the fewer individuals\nare infected with a contagious disease, the less likely it is that any\ngiven (currently healthy) infects him- or herself. These benefits\nobtain in a non-excludable and non-rivalrous manner. A healthier\npopulation is also more likely to be productive, making public health\nanalogous to education.\n\n1.5 An Alternative Definition\n\nAngela Kallhoff has offered an alternative, albeit similar, definition\nof a public good (Kallhoff 2011: Ch. 2). According to her, a public\ngood is one that satisfies the \u201cbasic availability\ncondition\u201d and the \u201copen access condition\u201d. Basic\navailability is her analogue of non-rivalry. A good satisfies this\ncondition whenever each person benefitting from it has access to the\nsame amount and the same types of benefits. To state the condition in\nthese terms makes explicit that there may exist a level of consumption\nat which sameness of amount and types of benefit are no longer\nguaranteed. A single ship\u2019s enjoying the benefits of a\nlighthouse does not affect another ship\u2019s doing the same but\nonce the sea is congested this may no longer be the case. A lighthouse\nis a public good because there exists a level at which each\nperson has access to the same amount and the same types of benefits.\nOpen access is Kallhoff\u2019s analogue of non-excludability. It\nstates that \n\n\nentrance barriers that regulate access to a good are not combined with\ncriteria which define a list of potential beneficiaries and exclude\nothers. (Kallhoff 2011: 43) \n\n\nClubs produce services for a specific group of beneficiaries, the club\nmembers. In order to profit from a lighthouse, an individual needs a\nboat and a desire to travel to the coast where the lighthouse is\nlocated but there is no pre-specified collective that constitutes the\nintended beneficiaries of this good.\n2. Public Goods and Externalities\n\nExternalities are effects of economic transactions on individuals that\nare not party to the transaction. The paradigm example is pollution: a\ncompany produces some good the production process for which is\n\u201cdirty\u201d in that it affects individuals independently of\nwhether or not they are customers of the company. If such effects are\nundesired, as in the case of pollution, they are called\nnegative externalities; if they are desired,\npositive externalities. A paradigmatic example of a positive\nexternality is the pollination created by a honey producer\u2019s\nbees. Individuals benefit from pollination whether or not they buy\nhoney.\n\nPublic goods create positive externalities. Suppose a group of\nindividuals get together and pay some company to produce (analog)\nradio broadcasts. Individuals who are not party to the transaction can\nnow benefit from the good. Similarly, if a group of citizens get\ntogether to clean up a public park, individuals will benefit whether\nor not they were part of the group of citizen cleaners.\n\nThe existence of a public good implies the existence of (positive)\nexternalities, but the reverse is not true. The beekeeper\u2019s bees\nmay pollinate the trees in the neighbouring orchard, thereby\nincreasing its production, but that does not mean that it is\nimpossible to exclude others from this or other benefits or that these\nbenefits are non-rivalrous. \n3. The Economics of Public Goods and the Public-Goods Problem\n3.1 The Public-Goods Problem\n\nThe provision of public goods is often associated with market failure\ndue to the externalities created by the public good. Suppose that in a\ntwo-by-two toy economy Bob and Sally decide how much to invest in a\ndiscrete public good G such as a radio station. Both have an\ninitial endowment of a private good (which functions as money in this\neconomy). The public good will be produced \\((G = 1)\\) if the sum of\ncontributions \\(g_{\\textrm{Bob}}\\) plus \\(g_{\\textrm{Sally}}\\) is\nhigher than the production cost c. Thus (Varian 1992: 415):\n\n\\[\nG =  \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\textrm{if } g_{\\textrm{Bob}} + g_{\\textrm{Sally}} \u2265 c\\\\\n0 & \\textrm{if } g_{\\textrm{Bob}} + g_{\\textrm{Sally}} < c. \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nHow much they will contribute will depend on their reservation prices\n\\(r_{\\textrm{Bob}}\\) and \\(r_{\\textrm{Sally}},\\) i.e., on the maximum\namount of the private good each agent is willing to give up for the\npublic good. It is then easy to show that the production of the public\ngood will be a Pareto-improvement if and only if (Varian 1992:\n 416)[2]:\n \n\n\\[\nr_{\\textrm{Bob}} + r_{\\textrm{Sally}}  > c,\n\\]\n\n\nthat is, if the sum of reservation utilities exceeds the cost\nof providing the public good. This is analogous to the efficiency\ncondition for a private good, which is efficiently provided whenever\nan individual\u2019s willingness to pay exceeds the cost of producing\nit. In case of a public good, since consumption is non-rivalrous, it\nis enough when the sum total of all reservation prices exceeds the\nproduction cost.\n\nIn the simple two-by-two case, let us assume that \\(r_{\\textrm{Bob}} =\nr_{\\textrm{Sally}} = 100\\) and that \\(c = 150,\\) so that the\nefficiency condition is satisfied. If either Bob or Sally buy the\npublic good, but not both, they would have to be charged the full\ncost, leading to an outcome of \\(-50.\\) The not-buying individual will\nfree-ride on the other\u2019s contribution and get 100. If both\ncontribute, each receives a benefit \\(100 - 150/2 = 25.\\) If neither\ncontributes, the good will not be produced and both end up with zero.\nThe payoffs are displayed in the matrix in Table 2.\n\n\nTable 2: A Public Goods Game\n\n\n\nSally \n\n\n\nContribute\nDon\u2019t Contribute \n\nBob \nContribute\n(25; 25)\n(\u221250; 100) \n\nDon\u2019t Contribute\n(100; \u221250) \n(0; 0) \n\n\n\nThis payoff structure is identical to a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma and\nillustrates the free-rider problem. Bob prefers the public good to be\nproduced but since he benefits from it whether or not he contributes,\nhis most preferred alternative is that in which Sally pays for its\nproduction and he free rides on her contribution. Sally faces\nidentical payoffs. Therefore, both will choose not to contribute,\nmeaning that the public good will not be produced, even though the\nalternative outcome in which both contribute would be Pareto superior.\nA Pareto-superior outcome is one that makes at least one individual\nbetter off while making no-one worse off. (Contribute; Contribute) is\nPareto-superior to (Don\u2019t contribute; Don\u2019t contribute).\n(Don\u2019t contribute; Don\u2019t contribute) is the equilibrium\nstrategy (in the sense that no player has a reason to deviate from\nplaying it, given the other player\u2019s move) but at the same time\nthere is an outcome both would prefer if it could be reached, namely,\n(Contribute; Contribute).\n\nGiven this structure of benefits as well as rationality and\nself-interest of the members of a group, we can expect that free\nmarkets will undersupply public goods. As individuals have strong\nincentives to free ride and the incentive structure is exactly the\nsame for everyone, everyone tries to free ride and the public good\nwill not be produced in consequence. Let us call the apparent\ninability of the market to provide public goods in a sufficient\nquantity the problem the \u201cpublic-goods problem\u201d.\n3.2 Responses to the Public-Goods Problem\n\nMany economists regard the public-goods problem as a justification for\nadvocating coercive government action (e.g., Sidgwick 1901; Pigou 1920\n[1932]; Samuelson 1954). The argument actually goes back to the\norigins of economics. In Book 5 of the Wealth of Nations,\nAdam Smith listed three functions of government. \u201cThe third and\nlast duty of the sovereign or commonwealth,\u201d Smith says,\n\n\nis that of erecting or maintaining those public institutions and those\npublic works, which, although they may be in the highest degree\nadvantageous to a great society, are, however, of such a nature, that\nthe profit could not repay the expense to any individual or small\nnumber of individuals, and which it therefore cannot be expected that\nany individual or small number of individuals should erect or\nmaintain. (1776: Bk 5, ch. 1)\n\n\nSimilarly, in the nineteenth century John Stuart Mill wrote that:\n\n\n\u2026 it is a proper office of government to build and maintain\nlighthouses, establish buoys, etc. for the security of navigation: for\nsince it is impossible that the ships at sea which are benefited by a\nlighthouse, should be made to pay a toll on the occasion of its use,\nno one would build lighthouses from motives of personal interest,\nunless indemnified and rewarded from a compulsory levy made by the\nstate. (1848 [1963: 968])\n\n\nHowever, it is not easy for the government to estimate the demand for\na given public good and calculate the appropriate level of taxes. If\npreferences were observable, the government could charge each citizen\naccording to their marginal benefit (thereby levying so-called\n\u201cLindahl taxes\u201d), and an efficient equilibrium (the\n\u201cLindahl equilibrium\u201d) would result (Varian 1992: 426;\nRoberts 1974). But preferences can\u2019t be observed. If they\ncan\u2019t, people have an incentive systematically to understate\ntheir reservation prices in the hope that others won\u2019t do the\nsame so they can free-ride on others\u2019 tax contributions. If\neveryone does that, the public good doesn\u2019t get funded\npublicly.\n\nLeif Johansen has argued that the free-riding argument is less\ncompelling than it appears (Johansen 1977). On the one hand, there is\nlittle evidence that people systematically misstate their preferences\nin elections. On the other hand, public goods are produced at rates\nthat are much higher than would be suggested by the free-rider theory,\nwhich assumes that utility is strictly increasing in private\nconsumption. The empirical evidence on these questions will be\nreviewed in\n Section 5\n of this entry.\n\nThere are mechanisms that encourage individuals to reveal their true\nvaluations of the public good. One is the so-called Groves-Clarke\nmechanism (after Groves 1973 and Clarke 1971). Here each individual\nsubmits a bid, which may be positive or negative, and which may or may\nnot reflect the individual\u2019s true value of the public good\n(i.e., the reservation price minus the cost). The public good is\nprovided if and only if the sum of bids is at least zero. Apart from\nthe public good, each individual receives a \u201cside payment\u201d\ncalculated as the sum of all other individuals\u2019 bids (which may\nalso be negative, i.e., a tax).\n\nNo individual has an incentive to misrepresent his or her true values\nunder the Groves-Clarke mechanism. Suppose we change the valuations in\nthe above example so that the public good is now worth \u221224 to\nBob (by adjusting his reservation price to 51). It should still be\nproduced as the sum of valuations remains positive (alternatively, the\nsum of Bob\u2019s and Sally\u2019s reservation prices remains above\nthe cost of producing the public good). Bob does not have an incentive\nto misrepresent his valuation (by bidding below \u221224) because\nwith the transfer of 25 he receives he is still better off than if the\npublic good was not produced. The same is true of Sally. She\u2019ll\nhave to pay a tax of 24 but is still better off than if the public\ngood was not produced. If we lower Bob\u2019s reservation price\nfurther to below \u221225, he would be worse off despite the transfer\nand thus accurately bid the true, low value. Sally, even though she\nwould prefer the public good to be produced in the absence of\ntransfers would also be worse off after paying the tax and therefore\nhas no incentive to overstate her valuation.\n\nThe problem with the Groves-Clarke mechanism is that it is very\nexpensive\u2014large payments are needed in order to induce\nindividuals to bid their correct value. There are alternative\nmechanisms that avoid positive payments but at the expense of\ngenerating social waste (Varian 1992: 428).\n4. The Private Provision of Public Goods\n4.1 Coupling\n\nMancur Olson was among the first economists who studied the private\nprovision of public goods in great detail (Olson 1971). He argued that\nthe existence of a common purpose or common interests is\ncharacteristic of organisations. But if these interests are\nserved, that means that a public good has been created. Therefore:\n\n\nIt is of the essence of an organization that it provides an\ninseparable, generalized benefit. It follows that the provision of\npublic or collective goods is the fundamental function of\norganizations generally. (Olson 1971: 15)\n\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that organisations cannot also produce\nprivate goods:\n\n\nThere is no suggestion here that states or other organizations provide\nonly public or collective goods. Governments often provide\nnoncollective goods like electric power, for example, and they usually\nsell such goods on the market much as private firms would do.\nMoreover, as later parts of this study will argue, large organizations\nthat are not able to make membership compulsory must also\nprovide some noncollective goods in order to give potential members an\nincentive to join. (Olson 1971: 16; emphasis in original)\n\n\nThe coupling of private and public goods is one important mechanism\nthrough which private enterprises can be enabled to provide public\ngoods. In the eighteenth century, lighthouses were public good because\ntheir \u201cconsumption\u201d was non-rivalrous (barring congestion)\nand non-excludable (using the technology available then). Port spaces\nare private goods, however. British lighthouses were often financed by\nimposing light dues on ship owners at the ports (Coase 1974). The dues\nwere calculated by the net ton per voyage for all ships arriving at,\nor departing from, ports in Britain. A public good that is coupled\nwith a private good as a mechanism for its financing is called an\n\u201cimpure\u201d public good (Cornes & Sandler 1984).\n\nShopping centres and some apartment buildings provide other examples\nof impure public goods. Shopping malls provide public spaces, streets,\nparking space, and security for which consumers pay indirectly by\nbuying the merchandise offered in the shopping centre. Similarly, some\napartment buildings offer common spaces and infrastructure for which\nowners pay through supplements to the apartment prices or rentals.\n\nThe shopping centre example illustrates a potential problem for the\nprivate provision of a public good. Suppose that it is prohibitively\nexpensive to charge individuals for the use of parking spaces\nprovided. Parking space is then a public good because non-shoppers can\nuse it free of charge. Suppose further that the owner of land nearby\nexploits the situation by building a competing shopping centre that\ndoes not offer parking space. The new shopping centre can price its\ncompetitor out of the market by offering lower prices for the\nmerchandise it sells because it does not have to pay for parking\nspace.\n\nHowever, at least in principle the owner of the first shopping centre\ncan avoid this by purchasing the surrounding land before free parking\nis allowed. After Ronald Coase this mechanism for solving\nexternalities problems is referred to as \u201cextending the role of\nthe firm\u201d (see Demsetz 1964). Another example for this mechanism\ninvolves the public good pollination. If a bee keeper and the owner of\nan orchard cannot agree on the value of the pollination and nectar,\neither is free to buy the other\u2019s property and thus internalise\nthe externality by extending the firm.\n4.2 Other Mechanisms\n\nAn alternative reason for existence of privately provided public goods\nis that people do not always act in a fully self-interested manner.\nMost economic models assume that people care only about the benefits a\npublic good provides to them, but people in fact also care about the\noutcomes for others. Donations to charity and political campaigns are\nobvious examples. One way to model this is to assume that the act of\ngiving itself provides additional utility distinct from the utility\nobtained from the aggregate level of provision of the public good\n(Steinberg 1987).\n\nA third reason for the ability of public goods to be provided\nprivately to be discussed here is the existence of social norms. For\nexample, as long as individuals meet repeatedly to decide\nabout the creation of a public good, they might realise that lying is\nself-destructive, and as the situation is iterated, it is possible\nthat a norm of truthful revelation of the valuations is developed upon\nwhich a convention of telling the truth would be built (Taylor 1976;\nSchotter 1981). That a non-co-operative strategy is not necessarily\noptimal in repeated games is a well-known result in game theory (see\nentry on\n game theory, section on repeated games and coordination).\n\nOther norms such as \u201ceveryone should do their bit\u201d or\nfairness and equality norms can also help to increase private\ncontributions to public goods. People might simply think that it is\nmorally wrong to free ride (Sugden 1984). Social norms can motivate\npeople to act altruistically but also help to solve co-ordination\nproblems by specifying property rights and the terms of contracts\n(Young 1998). Clean streets (the absence of littering) can be regarded\nas a public good, and let us assume that littering isn\u2019t\npunishable by law. In a game-theoretic setting, individuals would be\nexpected to underproduce the public good, i.e., to litter too much. A\nnorm not to litter can now help to induce people to co-operate and\nplay the non-Nash equilibrium but Pareto superior strategy. The\npunishment of norm-violators through social sanctions will help to\nmake people follow the norm without the government having to police\nnorm following.\n\nMost mechanisms discussed in this section can be expected to work\nbetter for local public goods than for national or global public\ngoods. It is easier to negotiate with neighbours about littering than\nwith people who live halfway across the globe, and people tend to feel\nmore altruistic towards others who live nearby and are in other ways\nsimilar (Hamilton 1964).\n5. Empirical Work on the Public-Goods Problem\n\nThere has been an explosion of experimental work relevant to the\npublic goods problem since the rise of experimental economics in the\nsecond half of the twentieth century. An important strand in this\nliterature describes results from so-called \u201cpublic goods\ngames\u201d (for a survey, see Ledyard 1995).\n5.1 Public Goods Games\n\nA typical public goods game set-up is as follows. A number n\nof university students is brought into a room and seated at a table.\nThey each receive an endowment of, say, \u20acx. They are then asked\nto decide how much of that to spend on a group project, where\ncontributions can range from \u20ac0 to the entire endowment. They put\ntheir contributions into an envelope so that other participants cannot\nsee how much each individual has contributed. The sum total of the\ncontributions is then doubled by the experimenter and divided equally\namong the participants.\n\nA public goods game is an n-person Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma.\nThe Pareto optimal outcome is one in which everyone contributes their\nentire endowment. With \\(n = 10\\) participants and an endowment of \\(x\n= \u20ac10,\\) each participant would wind up with \\(\u20ac20.\\) But\neach individual has an incentive to contribute less. If everyone\nelse contributed their entire endowment, each individual\ncould receive up to \\(9*\u20ac10*2/10+\u20ac10 = \u20ac28\\) if they\ncontributed nothing. This is the same for everyone in the game, and so\nthe Nash equilibrium strategy is to contribute \\(\u20ac0,\\) resulting\nin a payoff of \\(\u20ac10\\) for each participant.\n\nIn experiments, the Nash-equilibrium strategy is typically played by\nonly some of the players. Others contribute their entire endowment and\nyet others a sum in between. Total contributions typically lie between\n40% and 60% of the social optimum. Other stylised facts include\n(Ledyard 1995: 13):\n\n In one-shot trials and in the initial stages of finitely repeated\ntrials, subjects generally provide contributions halfway between the\nPareto-efficient level and the free riding level,\n Contributions decline with repetition, and\n Face to face communication improves the rate of\ncontribution.\n\n\nThe first two points have been described as \u201covercontribution\nand decay\u201d (Guala 2005): people tend to contribute more than we\nwould expect from a purely strategic point of view, but these\novercontributions decline when the game is played repeatedly (though\nnever to zero). Thus, people free ride less than advocates of\ngovernment funding of public goods often suggest, but private\nprovision is still at suboptimal levels.\n\nThere are a number of explanations for these phenomena. An obvious one\nis experience and learning: as players become more experienced with\nthe set up, they come to understand that they can profit from\nnon-co-operation (especially when others are slower to learn that\nlesson). Another one is that players\u2019 behaviour is motivated by\ndifferent considerations. Jon Elster describes six different types of\nco-operative behaviour:\n\n\nCooperation needs some individuals who are not motivated merely by the\ncosts and benefits to them. Two categories of such individuals are\nwhat we shall call full utilitarians and selfless\nutilitarians. The first will cooperate if and only if their\ncontribution increases the average benefit. [\u2026] The second\ncategory will cooperate if and only if their contribution increases\nthe average benefit, not counting the costs to them\u2026\n\n\nIf the selfless utilitarians are too few, or if the predicament I\ndescribed deters them from acting, unconditional cooperators\nare needed\u2026 These actors take a number of shapes\u2014they may\nbe Kantians, saints, heroes, fanatics, or they may be slightly mad.\nWhat they have in common is that they act neither as a function of the\nexpected consequences of their action, nor as a function of the number\nof other cooperators.\n\nA further category of actors would never act as first movers, however.\nThese are the individuals whose motivation is triggered by the\nobservation of others\u2019 cooperating or by the knowledge that\ncooperators can observe them\u2026 A first subset of this group are\nmotivated by the quasi-moral norm of fairness: it is not fair for us\nto remain on the sidelines while others are taking risks for our\ncommon cause. [\u2026] A second subset are motivated by social\nnorms. If noncooperators can be identified and subjected to social\nostracism, as is usually the case at the workplace, for example,\ncooperators may shame them into joining.\n\nA final category are those who join the movement for its\n\u201cprocess benefits\u201d\u2014because it is fun or otherwise\npersonally appealing. (Elster 2007: 397\u20139; emphasis in\noriginal)\n\n\nThe presence of a certain proportion of conditional co-operators would\nexplain why contributions start relatively high but go down over time.\nEmpirical investigations confirm this explanation as well as the\npresence of \u201cmixed motives\u201d (Villeval 2012). In a classic\npaper, James Andreoni has argued that patterns observed in the data\nabout charitable giving from U.S. national surveys are inconsistent\nwith a model of pure altruism so that other motivations must be\nincluded to account for these data (Andreoni 1988).\n\nA large number of factors appears to affect the size of the\ncontributions. Apart from repetition (one-shot vs repeated games and\nnumber of rounds), experience and learning, and communication, the\nmarginal payoff of contributions, the size of the group, provision\npoints (in some experiments the public good is provided only if\ncontributions reach a certain threshold), the heterogeneity of payoffs\nand endowments, and moral suasion (i.e., the priming of experimental\nsubjects by experimenters) are among the factors that make a\ndifference (Ledyard 1995: 36). Some results are quite surprising. For\nexample, contributions increase with increasing thresholds at which\nthe public good is provided while the probability that the threshold\nwill be reached goes down (Isaac, Walker, & Thomas 1984). However,\nwith heterogeneous endowments, there are no significant differences of\ncontributions at different levels (Rapoport & Suleiman 1993).\nSimilarly, contrary to economists\u2019 expectations, group size can\nhave a positive effect on contributions while it dilutes the\neffect of marginal returns (Isaac, Walker, & Williams 1994). That\ncausal factors affect experimental results in unsystematic and quite\nunexpected ways appears to be a fairly general feature of experimental\neconomics (Reiss 2008: Ch. 5).\n5.2 Other Kinds of Evidence: Field Studies, Observational Studies, Case Studies\n\nOther kinds of empirical evidence that is relevant to the public goods\nproblem include field experiments, observational studies, and case\nstudies. They all have in common that they provide evidence that\nindividuals make some voluntary contributions to public\ngoods. What they investigate are the factors that affect the sizes of\nthe contributions and the mechanisms used to encourage people to\ncontribute.\n\nField studies have been used to examine the relationship\nbetween an individual\u2019s contributions to a public good and\nothers\u2019 contributions. Depending on what one thinks\nindividuals\u2019 primary motivations are, one would expect an\nindividual\u2019s and others\u2019 contributions to be substitutes\nor complements. If an individual is primarily motivated by altruism,\nhe or she will care about the consumption of others and therefore\ncontribute less when others or the government already contribute\nenough. In this case we would expect the two kinds of contributions to\nbe substitutes. If, by contrast, an individual is primarily motivated\nmy social norms such as fairness and reciprocity, he or she will\ncontribute when others do their bit. In that case, we would expect the\ntwo kinds of contributions to be complements. Whether they are on\naverage substitutes or complements is an issue that is difficult to\ndetermine in laboratory experiments due to the relatively small sample\nsizes and because the mix of motivations may differ between experiment\nand field.\n\nA field experiment involving an on-air fundraising campaign for a\npublic radio station found support for the complementarity hypothesis\n(Shang & Croson 2009). Specifically, if social information is\nprovided about a high contribution of another donor, pledges increase\nand the likelihood that a donor contributes again next year goes up.\nThe same has been found in a study of voluntary contributions to an\ninformation good (a newsletter) on the Internet (Borck et al. 2006).\nThere have also been field studies of alternative provision\nmechanisms, comparing a voluntary contribution mechanism for a pure\npublic environmental good to a green tariff mechanism, which can be\ninterpreted as an impure public good (Kotchen & Moore 2007).\n\nThe substitutes-vs-complements issue has also been investigated in\nobservational studies. That contributions are perfect\nsubstitutes, i.e., that government contributions or other private\ncontributions crowd out an individual\u2019s contribution completely\nis widely rejected. \u201cComplete crowding out\u201d here would\nmean that every dollar spent on a public good by the government\nreduces private spending by the same amount. Most studies find either\nno crowding out, or a merely a small amount. For example, Kingma 1989\nand Kingma & McClelland 1995, focusing on public radio, found only\na limited amount of crowding out between 12% and 19% of government\nexpenditures on public radio (i.e., one dollar spent by government\nreduces private contributions by 12\u201319 cents).\n\nThere are a number of historical case studies as well. Ronald\nCoase\u2019s study of the provision of lighthouses in nineteenth\ncentury Britain has already been mentioned. Cowen 1992 contains a\nnumber of further case studies that look closely at contracts between\nbee keepers and apple growers (exchanging the public good pollination)\nin Washington State, fire protection, leisure and recreation in the\nUnited States, species conservation in the Cayman Islands, and\neducation in Great Britain before large-scale state subsidies. In each\nof these cases, the authors point to private solutions to the public\ngoods problem. A historical review of publicly financed public goods\nis provided in Desai 2003.\n6. The Ethics of Public Goods: Should the Government Pay for Public Goods?\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that the standard justification for\ngovernment funding is attractive because it is based on a minimum of\nnormative assumptions. David Schmidtz, for example, writes that \n\n\none of the most attractive features of the public goods argument is\nthe minimal nature of the normative assumptions it must make in order\nto ground a justification of the state. (Schmidtz 1991: 82) \n\n\nIndeed, it seems that all that is required is that a government\nintervention is justified if it brings about a state of affairs that\nmakes everyone better off than under any non-intervention\nalternative.\n6.1 Controversial Assumptions in Welfare Economics\n\nHowever, to reach the conclusion that the government should provide\npublic goods, one requires a number of additional assumptions, all of\nwhich are controversial. Standard welfare economics identifies\nwell-being with preference satisfaction, a view that has received much\ncriticism (see entry on\n well being;\n Nussbaum 2001; Hausman et al. 2017: Ch. 8; Reiss 2013: Ch. 12). It is\nimplausible to assume that people always choose what is best for them.\nPeople may have inconsistent or unstable preferences such as the\nsmoker who flushes his cigarettes down the toilet in an attempt to\nquit smoking, just in order to buy a new pack the next day. If people\nhave inconsistent or unstable preferences, it is unclear which\nconsistent set to choose for policy. Uninformed preferences also\nappear to be a bad basis for policy. If people erroneously believe,\nsay, that there is no external threat, they might prefer less\ninvestment in national defence than if they were fully informed. It\nhas been argued that in the political realm, insufficient knowledge is\nthe norm rather than the exception (Somin 1998, Caplan 2007, Somin\n2013). It might be extraordinarily difficult to assess the value of a\npublic good to an individual, especially if the public good is a\nnational or global one such as defence, climate change mitigation or\nbasic research.\n\nIt has therefore been argued that rational or laundered or informed\npreferences should provide the basis for policy decisions (e.g.,\nThaler & Sunstein 2008, Anomaly 2015). But it is not clear that we\ncan straightforwardly assess what citizens would prefer if they were\nfully rational and informed. There is always the danger that whoever\nmakes that assessment substitutes his or her preferences for the\ncitizens\u2019 or that his or her preferences influence the judgement\nabout what the citizens\u2019 preferences might be (Rizzo &\nWhitman 2008, 2009).\n\nAssessing the value of a public good in terms of preference\nsatisfaction, actual or rational, involves another problem: the\nimpossibility of interpersonal comparisons. Suppose there are two\nindivisible public goods A and B, Bob prefers A\nwhile Sally prefers B, and Bob and Sally\u2019s combined\nwealth suffices to buy only either A or B. Under a\npreference-satisfaction account of welfare, there arguably is no\nnormatively defensible way to compare Bob\u2019s welfare\nwhen A is purchased to Sally\u2019s welfare when B is\npurchased or to compare what Bob would gain by purchasing and what\nSally would gain by purchasing B. Dan Hausman has argued that\nthis problem constitutes a reason to abandon the\npreference-satisfaction account of welfare because any moral theory\nthat assesses situations fully or in part in terms of welfare requires\ninterpersonal comparisons (Hausman 1995).\n\nStandard welfare economics does not make interpersonal comparisons\nbecause it asks whether policies constitute a Pareto improvement over\nthe status quo. A policy constitutes a Pareto improvement if and only\nif it makes some people better off while making no-one worse off. But\nfew policies are as unequivocal as this standard demands. Especially\nwhen it comes to the items that are usually discussed under the rubric\nof public goods, it is rarely if ever the case that no-one is made\nworse off by the provision.\n\nAn alternative that has been introduced in the late 1930s is\nHicks-Kaldor improvement (after Hicks 1939 and Kaldor 1939). If there\nare winners and losers to a policy, it constitutes a Hicks-Kaldor\nimprovement whenever losers can be compensated by winners\u2019\ngains. But that losers can be compensated is little\nconsolation unless they actually are compensated, and there is no\nreason to believe that this always happens (see for instance Rodrik\n2017 on the failures to compensate losers from free-trade\narrangements).\n\nCharacterising the public goods problem as a simple Prisoners\u2019\nDilemma is therefore a significant idealisation. Frequently, the\nproduction of a public good will benefit some but make others worse\noff. Generally speaking, the decision whether to provide a public good\nor not involves issues of fairness, equality and justice.\n\nWelfare economists tend to ignore such issues because neither Pareto\nimprovements nor Kaldor-Hicks improvements (in their usual\ninterpretations) need information about anything other than\npreferences. Indeed, standard welfare economics assumes that\nwell-being is all that matters to the evaluation of social outcomes.\nMost people, however, care also about other values (Sen 1999: Ch. 3;\nHausman et al. 2017: Chs 9\u201312; Reiss 2013: Ch. 14).\n\nOne moral issue that has to be addressed even when the item in\nquestion is unequivocally a public good to everyone affected by its\nprovision is that of paternalism (see entry on\n paternalism).\n It is by no means obvious that a coercive government intervention,\neven one that makes everyone better off is justified. Austrian-School\neconomist Hans-Herrmann Hoppe expresses scepticism about the\npermissibility of such interventions when he writes:\n\n\nThe norm required to reach the above conclusion is this: Whenever one\ncan somehow prove that the production of a particular good or service\nhas a positive effect on someone else but would not be produced at all\nor would not be produced in a definite quantity or quality unless\ncertain people participated in its financing, then the use of\naggressive violence against these persons is allowed, either directly\nor indirectly with the help of the state, and these persons may be\nforced to share in the necessary financial burden. (Hoppe 1989:\n31)\n\n\nInfringements on rights are not the only worry we might have. Some\npublic goods might disproportionately benefit those who are already\nrelatively well-off and therefore exacerbate existing inequalities.\nSome aspects of tertiary education, for instance, might well be public\ngoods but if tertiary education was mainly to the benefit of\nrelatively well-off individuals, government provision could be\nconsidered unfair. It is therefore not clear whether the government\nprovision of a public good is morally good, all things considered.\n6.2 The Market As a Discovery Process\n\nOne point that advocates of government provision of public goods often\noverlook is the information creation and coordinating function of the\nprice system (as described by Hayek 1945). In a market, prices\ngenerate information about preferences and scarcities. If a good is\nwanted by many individuals, it will become more scarce and its price\nwill rise. The increase in price does not only provide a reason for\nconsumers to buy less of it, it also signals to producers to make more\nand to potential market entrants that the market is lucrative. In the\nlong run, supply should therefore increase and the price fall again.\nThis mechanism does not operate when the government provides the\npublic good and finances it by taxation. If the government builds,\nsay, a lighthouse, it will be difficult to determine how much to\ninvest every year, whether and how to extend or alter the service\nprovided by the good (e.g., by building a second lighthouse nearby),\nand whether to invest in the development of new technologies.\n6.3 Market Norms and Other Norms\n\nSo far, we have looked at public goods mainly as economic goods that\nhave certain characteristics that give rise to doubts whether they can\nbe provided privately at efficient levels. The government might be\njustified in engaging in the production of a public good because it\ncorrects a market failure. Such an argument will always be contingent\non private actors\u2019 inability to produce the good or enough of\nit, which is why mechanisms that encourage private provision have been\nexamined at some length in\n Section 4\n above.\n\nSome philosophers have offered arguments to the effect that the\ngovernment should provide certain goods, independently of whether or\nnot they could be produced in sufficient quantities by the market.\nMichael Waltzer and Elizabeth Anderson have argued that the sphere of\nthe market should be limited because market norms do not embody\ncertain important values and market exchange may undermine ideals and\ninterests legitimately protected by the state (Walzer 1983, Anderson\n1993). According to Anderson, market norms have the following five\nfeatures: they are impersonal (independent of the relationship and of\nthe other party\u2019s ends), egoistic (the goal is to satisfy\none\u2019s personal interests), exclusive (defined as above),\nwant-regarding (as opposed to responsive to objective needs), and\noriented to \u201cexit\u201d rather than \u201cvoice\u201d (rather\nthan voicing one\u2019s complaint one seeks an alternative) (see\nAnderson 1993: 143\u20134).\n\nA good is an economic good according to Anderson if its\nproduction, distribution, and enjoyment are properly governed by\nmarket norms (Anderson 1993: 146). This contrasts with a number of\nother kinds of goods, such as gift goods. Friendly gift exchange\nshould be responsive to the personal characteristics of the receiver,\nand to the relationship itself, rather than \u201cimpersonal\u201d.\nIt should also express an understanding of the relationship and not\nmerely satisfy the receiver\u2019s subjective wants. Giving money is\noften regarded as offensive exactly because it ignores these\ncharacteristics of gift goods.\n\nWhat economists call public goods fall into Anderson\u2019s category\nof \u201cpolitical goods\u201d. They are characterised by three\nnorms that oppose the respective market norms (Anderson 1993: 159).\nFirst, one\u2019s freedom is exercised through voice rather than\nexit. Second, goods are distributed according to public principles\nrather than subjective wants. Third, the goods are provided on a\nnon-exclusive basis. About these goods she says:\n\n\nSome goods can be secured only through a form of democratic provision\nthat is nonexclusive, principle- and need- regarding, and regulated\nprimarily through voice. To attempt to provide these goods through\nmarket mechanisms is to undermine our capacity to value and realize\nourselves as fraternal democratic citizens. (Anderson 1993: 159)\n\n\nThe examples Anderson discusses in this section of her\nbook\u2014roads, parks, primary and secondary education\u2014are all\npublic goods in the economist\u2019s sense. Providing them privately\nwould undermine the \u201ccapacity to value and realize ourselves as\nfraternal democratic citizens\u201d because exercising freedom by\nvoice would be replaced by exit (e.g., when parents send their kids to\nschools that approximate their values better than others instead of\ncontributing to curricula through voice), by allowing owners to\ndictate terms on the basis of their wants instead of using principles\nsuch as freedom of speech and association (e.g., when owners of malls\nsuppress speech and political activity they find offensive), and by\nthe ability of owners to exclude non-payers instead of enabling all to\nmeet one another on terms of equality (e.g., in the case of\nparks).\n\nIn a similar vein, Angela Kallhoff argues that some (but not all)\npublic goods provide additional externalities that are essential for\nthe functioning of a democracy (Kallhoff 2011, 2014). Some public\ngoods constitute visible expressions of solidarity and social justice\namong citizens (\u201ccentral goods\u201d), some support\nconnectivity and serve as representations of shared interests\n(\u201cconnectivity goods\u201d), and some serve as visible\nrepresentations of a shared sense of citizenship\n(\u201cidentification goods\u201d). The absence of these goods would\nundermine the ability of the citizenry to engage in public\ndeliberation and develop a sense of self-determination.\n",
