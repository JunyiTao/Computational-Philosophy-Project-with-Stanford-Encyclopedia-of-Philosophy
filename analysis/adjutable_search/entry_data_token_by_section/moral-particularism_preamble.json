    "main_text": "\n\n\nMoral Particularism, at its most trenchant, is the claim that there\nare no defensible moral principles, that moral thought does not consist\nin the application of moral principles to cases, and that the morally\nperfect person should not be conceived as the person of principle.\nThere are more cautious versions, however. The strongest defensible\nversion, perhaps, holds that though there may be some moral principles,\nstill the rationality of moral thought and judgement in no way depends\non a suitable provision of such things; and the perfectly moral judge\nwould need far more than a grasp on an appropriate range of principles\nand the ability to apply them. Moral principles are at best crutches\nthat a morally sensitive person would not require, and indeed the use\nof such crutches might even lead us into moral error.\n\n\nThe particularist\u2019s opponent is the generalist. Ethical generalism\nis the view that the rationality of moral thought and judgement depends\non a suitable provision of moral principles.\n\nThis entry provides a high-level introduction. For a more detailed\npresentation, see the entry on the debate between\n moral particularism and moral generalism.\n\n",
