    "main_text": "Life and Works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\nBiographical data on the life of Shihab al-Din al-Suhrawardi, the\n\u2018Master of Illumination\u2019 (shaykh al-ishraq), is\nscarce. Born in the northwestern Iranian village of Suhraward around\n1154, he pursued his education in nearby Maraghah with Majd al-Din\nal-Jili, one of the teachers of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1210). He then\ntraveled to Isfahan, where he studied with the logician Zahir (al-Din)\nal-Farisi (or Qari) with whom he read the Nasiri\nObservations, a text on logic penned by \u2018Umar Ibn Sahlan\nal-Sawi (or Sawaji) (d.ca.1158). Suhrawardi then embarked on a journey\nin search of knowledge. According to Shams al-Din al-Shahrazuri\n(d.ca.1288), he would have traveled extensively throughout Anatolia\nand befriended Sufi masters, such as Fakhr al-Din al-Mardini (d.1198)\n(who also taught medicine and Avicennan works), seemingly seeking\nspiritual guidance and experiences, Suhrawardi leading himself the\nlife of a wondering ascetic (retreats, ascetic practices) (Shahrazuri,\n1988). The putative classical Sufi spiritual lineage put forward by\nbiographers and Suhrawardi himself partake of Suhrawardi\u2019s\nclaims to revive the intellectual heritage of a long intitiatic chain\nof transmitters who possessed \u2018true\u2019 knowledge, that of\nthe Ancients (Husrawaniyyun) (Landolt, 2008, 240\u2013242).\nLike most scholars of the time, Suhrawardi was also seeking patrons\nduring his travels among the local Anatolian rulers.\n\nIn 1183, Suhrawardi arrived in Aleppo, the year the Ayyubid ruler,\nSaladin (d.1193), conquered the city and handed it over to his son\nal-Zahir (d.1216). A Shafi\u2018i Sunni, Suhrawardi made a name for\nhimself among the religious scholars of the city (Marcotte, 2001,\n399\u2013400). He eventually managed to secure an audience at the\npalace, and to befriend al-Zahir. In 1186, he completed his most\nimportant work, the Philosophy of Illumination (hereafter\n PI),[1]\n at the age of thirty-three. Sometime in 1189 or soon therafter,\n\u2018Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi met Suhrawardi in Aleppo, probably\nafter having come across Suhrawardi\u2019s Intimations,\nFlashes of Light (al-Lamahat) and Ascending\nSteps (al-Ma\u2018arij) while in Mosul, works he did\nnot find useful, most probably because Suhrawardi (that\n\u2018imbecile\u2019) had rejected foundamental elements of\nPeripateticism of which he was fond (Martini Bonadeo, 2015, 2013,\n124\u2013125). And there is a possibly apcryphal meeting Suhrawardi\nhad with Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (Nasr and Aminrazavi, 2010, 185). \n\nA combination of religious and political factors led to\nSuhrawardi\u2019s downfall, namely the fact that he succeeded in\nalienating the powerful religious elite of Aleppo, on whom the\nAyyubids depended for the legitimacy of their rule over the city, by\nalways gaining the upper hand when he debated with the learned of the\ncity, none of whom were able to keep up intellectually with him, and\nseemingly behaving in such a manner as to display a condescending\narrogance for the scholars of Aleppo (Marcotte, 2001, 400\u2013401).\nOn the one hand, he was accused of holding heretical beliefs, a vague\ncharge easily supported with the pre-Islamic Persian names and symbols\nthat some of his works contained, his claim to divine-like\ninspiration, and his questioning, in light of God\u2019s omnipotence,\nthe logical finality of Prophethood. On the other hand, his\nassociation with al-Zahir, the Ayyubid ruler, and his earlier\nrelationships with the recently conquered Artuqids, one of the local\nrulers of southwest Anatolia to whom his Tablets to\n\u2018Imad (written in Aleppo) was dedicated, may have been\ninterpreted as political intrigue or, at worst, holding Isma\u2018ili\nviews: Suhrawardi\u2019s views regarding the \u2018Caliph of God on\nEarth\u2019; the hierarchical conception of being structured around\nthe \u2018victorial domination (qahr)\u2019 relation of\n\u2018irridiations\u2019 (shuruq) of light in terms similar\nto the Arabic \u2018Empedoclean\u2019 views found in the works of\nSijistani (d. after 971) or the Ikhwan al-Safa\u2019, etc. (Landolt,\n2008, 242\u2013244). \n\nIn the end, Suhrawardi\u2019s fate was sealed with accusations of\nheresy (rather than treason). Biographers and historians remained at\nodds over the exact charges and course of events that led to his\nexecution at the end of 1191 (or early1192) (Marcotte 2001a). \n",
