    "main_text": "Welfare Economics || Old and New Welfare Economics\n3.1 Old and New Welfare Economics\n\nThe proponents of a \u201cnew\u201d welfare economics (Hicks,\nKaldor, Scitovsky) have distanced themselves from their predecessors\n(Marshall, Pigou, Lerner) by abandoning the idea of making social\nwelfare judgments on the basis of interpersonal comparisons of\nutility. Their problem was then that in absence of any kind of\ninterpersonal comparisons, the only principle on which to ground their\njudgments was the Pareto principle, according to which a situation is\na global improvement if it is an improvement for every member of the\nconcerned population (there are variants of this principle depending\non how individual improvement is defined, in terms of preferences or\nsome notion of well-being, and depending on whether it is a strict\nimprovement for all members or some of them stay put). Since most\nchanges due to public policy hurt some subgroups for the benefit of\nothers, the Pareto principle remains generally silent. The need for a\nless restrictive criterion of evaluation has led Kaldor (1939) and\nHicks (1939) to propose an extension of the Pareto principle through\ncompensation tests. According to Kaldor\u2019s criterion, a situation\nis a global improvement if ex post the gainers could compensate the\nlosers. For Hicks\u2019 criterion, the condition is that ex ante the\nlosers could not compensate the gainers (a change from situation A to\nsituation B is approved by Hicks\u2019 criterion if the change from B\nto A is not approved by Kaldor\u2019s criterion). These criteria are\nmuch less partial than the Pareto principle, but they remain partial\n(that is, they fail to rank many pairs of alternatives). This is not,\nhowever, their main drawback. They have been criticized for two basic\nflaws. First, for plausible definitions of how the compensation\ntransfers could be computed, these criteria may lead to inconsistent\nsocial judgments: the same criterion may simultaneously declare that a\nsituation A is better than another situation B, and conversely.\nScitovsky (1941) has proposed to combine the two criteria, but this\ndoes not prevent the occurrence of intransitive social judgments.\nSecond, the compensation tests have a dubious ethical value. If the\ncompensatory transfers are performed in Kaldor\u2019s criterion, then\nthe Pareto criterion alone suffices since after compensation everybody\ngains. If the compensatory transfers are not performed, the losers\nremain losers and the mere possibility of compensation is a meager\nconsolation to them. Such criteria are then typically biased in favor\nof the rich whose willingness to pay is generally high (i.e., they are\nwilling to give a lot in order to obtain whatever they want, and\ntherefore they can easily compensate the losers; when they do not\nactually pay the compensation, they can have the cake and eat it\ntoo).\n\nCost-benefit analysis has more recently developed criteria which are\nvery similar and rely on the summation of willingness to pay across\nthe population. In spite of repeated criticism by specialists (Arrow\n1951, Boadway and Bruce 1984, Sen 1979, Blackorby and Donaldson 1990),\npractitioners of cost-benefit analysis and some branches of economic\ntheory (industrial organization, international economics) still\ncommonly rely on such criteria. More sophisticated variants of\ncost-benefit analysis (Layard and Glaister 1994, Dr\u00e8ze and\nStern 1987) avoid these problems by relying on weighted sums of\nwillingness to pay or even on consistent social welfare functions.\nAdler (2012) offers a comprehensive study of the foundations of the\nsocial welfare function approach to cost-benefit analysis. Many\nspecialists of public economics (e.g. Stiglitz 1987) have considered\nthat the Pareto criterion was the core ethical principle on which\neconomists should buttress their social evaluations, and that they\nshould focus on denouncing all sources of inefficiency in social\norganizations and public policies.\n\nA subfield of welfare economics focused on the possibility of making\nsocial welfare judgments on the basis of national income. An increase\nin national income may reflect an increase in social welfare under\nsome stringent assumptions, most conspicuously the assumption that the\ndistribution of incomes is socially optimal. Although very\nrestrictive, this kind of result has a lasting influence, in theory\n(international economics) and in practice (the salience of GDP growth\nin policy discussions). There exists a school of social indicators\n(see the Social Indicators Research journal) which fights\nthis influence and the number of alternative indicators (of happiness,\ngenuine progress, social health, economic well-being, etc.) has soared\nin the last decades (see e.g. Miringoff and Miringoff 1999, Frey and\nStutzer 2002, Kahneman et al. 2004 and Gadrey and Jany-Catrice\n2006).\n\nBergson (1938) and Samuelson (1947, 1981) occupy a special position,\nwhich may be described as a third way between old and new welfare\neconomics. From the former, they retain the goal of making complete\nand consistent social welfare judgments with the help of well-defined\nsocial welfare functions. The formula\nW(U1(x),\u2026,Un(x))\nis often named a \u201cBergson-Samuelson social welfare\nfunction\u201d (x is the social state;\nUi(x), for\ni=1,\u2026,n, is individual i\u2019s\nutility in this state). With the latter, however, they share the idea\nthat only ordinal non-comparable information should be retained about\nindividual preferences. This may seem contradictory with the formula\nof the Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function, in which individual\nutility functions appear, and there has been a controversy about the\npossibility of constructing a Bergson-Samuelson social welfare\nfunction on the sole basis of individual ordinal non-comparable\npreferences (see in particular Arrow (1951), Kemp and Ng (1976),\nSamuelson (1977, 1987), Sen (1986) and a recent discussion in\nFleurbaey and Mongin (2005)). Samuelson and his defenders are commonly\nconsidered to have lost the contest, but it may also be argued that\ntheir opponents have misunderstood them. Indeed, individual utility\nfunctions in the\nW(U1(x),\u2026,Un(x))\nformula are, according to Bergson and Samuelson, to be constructed out\nof individual preference orderings, on the basis of fairness\nprinciples. The logical possibility of such a construction has been\nrepeatedly proven by Samuelson (1977), Pazner (1979), Mayston (1974,\n1982). The fact that such a construction does not require any other\ninformation than ordinal non-comparable preferences is indisputable.\nBergson and Samuelson acknowledged the need for interpersonal\ncomparisons, but considered that these could be done, in an ethically\nrelevant way, on the sole basis of non-comparable preference\norderings. They failed, however, to be more specific about the\nfairness principles on which the construction could be justified. The\ntheory of fair allocation (see\n \u00a7 6)\n may fill the gap.\n",
