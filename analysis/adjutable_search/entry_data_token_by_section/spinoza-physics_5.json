    "main_text": "Physical cartesianism and the consequences of metaphysical divergence || Striving and teleology\n3.4 Striving and teleology\n\nQuite apart from the question whether Spinoza intended to impose this\nmore active reading of inertial dynamics on Cartesian philosophy,\neither deliberately or unawares, he clearly made the striving conatus\nof individual modes an important centerpiece of the mature philosophy\nhe presented in the Ethics. IIIp6, which articulates the\nconatus doctrine according to which \u201ceach thing, as far as it\ncan by its own power, strives to persevere in its own being\u201d,\nhas been the subject of a great amount of interpretive puzzlement in\nthe literature. A main focus of this puzzlement is the extent to which\nIIIp6 represents a teleological element in Spinoza's natural\nphilosophy. It is certainly central to Spinoza's subsequent treatment\nof human psychology, according to which we strive to obtain those\nthings that increase our power and to avoid those that diminish it.\nSpinoza takes his conatus principle to license inferences from\nsentences of the form \u201cx would increase\nA\u2018s power\u201d to sentences of the form\n\u201cA does x so far as A is able\u201d;\nthis is genuine explanatory teleology, treating a state to be\nachieved\u2014the increase of power\u2014as an end towards which a\nthing's activity is directed, and thus as an explanatory ground for\nbehaviors.\n\nOne ground for reading teleology out of the conatus principle and for\nregarding both teleology and that principle as fundamentally\nirrelevant to Spinoza's physical theory is that the latter's first\nexplicit appearance in part III of the Ethics comes long\nafter Spinoza presents his accounts of extended nature and the basic\nmechanics of modes thereof, indeed in a way that makes it very hard to\nsee how any teleology could be involved at all. Ip28 denies that any\nsingular thing can be determined to exist or to produce an effect\nunless it has been so determined by a prior finite cause, ad\ninfinitum. The use made of Ip28 in IIp9 suggests that Spinoza intends\nIp28 to articulate not just a necessary condition on modal existence\nand determination, but the exclusive means by which finite modes are\nbrought to existence and determined to have any particular effects.\nThis seems to allow no room for action of bodies in their own right,\nno residual space for any contribution to the motions of bodies of the\nactive striving of the moving bodies themselves. Moreover, Spinoza\nexpressly denies that nature is a teleological system, and claims that\nfinal causal/teleological explanations \u201cturns nature completely\nupside down. For what is really a cause it considers as an effect, and\nconversely, what is an effect it considers as a cause\u201d\n(Appendix, I).\n\nIn this light, the problem from the standpoint of the metaphysics of\nExtension \u2014 the basis of physical theory\u2014is to explain why\nthe specific configuration of a given existing mode makes any\ncontribution at all to the determinations that result from the\noperation of external modal causes. It would be rash to read Ip28 in\nsuch a way that the causal powers of a body owe everything to the\ncontributions of extrinsic causes, and nothing to the intrinsic nature\nof the body itself. Spinoza says in IIp13s A1 that \u201call modes by\nwhich a body is affected by another body follow both from the nature\nof the body affected and at the same time the nature of the affecting\nbody, so that \u2026 different bodies may be moved differently by\none and the same body.\u201d (This is a key point in Spinoza's\naccount of corporeal imagination, mental representation and the first\nkind of knowledge, offered at IIp17\u201341.) So the nature of an\naffected body makes a difference to the way it is affected\nextrinsically. This is not surprising. But then what explains why a\nbody's nature makes a contribution to the way extrinsic influences\ndetermine it? As we saw in the previous sections, some answer to this\nquestion is required to make sense of the PLMM, and hence of all of\nthe collision laws. The notion, shared by the teleological reading of\nconatus and the active reading of Spinozistic inertia, that it is in\nthe nature of bodies actively to strive of their own power, would seem\nto help. But is it Spinozistic? At a minimum, any articulation of this\nnotion must be free from illicit teleology.  Carriero (2017)\nsuggests a non-teleological reading of the conatus doctrine that seems\nsuitable.  On his view, conatus should be understood as an\nexpression of the idea that it is constitutive of their finite\nindividuality that individuals maximize their being. \n\u201cDynamic constructions do tend to maximize their being.  But\nthis is not because their reality is their end or good; it is an\nartifact of their stability as real individuals in the plenum\u201d\n(152).  But what accounts for this stability?  We require a\nmore probing examination into Spinoza's conception of the nature of\nindividual bodies.\n",
