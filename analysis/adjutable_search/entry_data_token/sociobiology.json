O.\nWilson\u2019s Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975), in\nwhich he described it as the \u201csystematic study of the biological\nbasis of all social behavior\u201d (Wilson, 1975, 4). Wilson seems to\nintend \u201cthe biological basis of behavior\u201d to refer to the\nsocial and ecological causes driving the evolution of behavior in\nanimal populations, rather than the neurological or psychological\ncauses of behavior in individuals; however, Wilson clearly thought\nsociobiology and neuroscience would have important theoretical\ninteractions (Wilson, 1975, 5). Wilson\u2019s references to evolution\nare also usually references to evolution by natural selection,\nalthough he does accept that the action of selection on animal\nsocieties can result in maladaptive outcomes at the level of\npopulations (see, for example Wilson, 1975, Chapter 4).\n\nHowever, \u201csociobiology\u201d as a term existed well before\nWilson, sometimes to refer to the kind of work identified by Wilson in\nthe non-human animal part of his book: methodologically adaptationist\napproaches to understanding the causes and nature of non-human animal\nbehavior (see for example, Schein 1956), but also occasionally to work\nof this kind in humans (for example, Ashley-Montagu 1940, Hentig 1948,\nHealey 1949). A few scientists also continue to use the term (for\nexample, Hrdy, 1999, uses the term for this work in both humans and\nnon-human animals). However, during the controversy over Wilson\u2019s\nbook and after most scientists using approaches to non-human animals\nshifted to using other terms, most commonly \u201cbehavioral\necology\u201d (Krebs and Davies, 1978).\n\nFamously, the first and last chapters of Sociobiology\naddressed Wilson\u2019s views about the amenability of human behavior\nto be studied by this sort of project. These views were developed to\nsome extent in his later book, On Human Nature (Wilson,\n1978). For a variety of reasons, primarily because Wilson was\nperceived to be arguing that many problematic social behaviors were\nunchangeable, the contents of these two chapters provoked an extremely\nacrimonious debate sometimes referred to as the \u201csociobiology\nwars\u201d (one well regarded discussion of the history and sociology\nof the \u201csociobiology wars\u201d is Segerstrale, 2000). Because\nthis debate attracted so much attention, the term\n\u201csociobiology\u201d has come to be associated popularly with\nWilson\u2019s proposed human project, or at least the description of it\nset up for attack by its critics (see, for example, Allen et al.,\n1975; Caplan, 1979; Gould, 1977, 251\u2013259; 1978; Sociobiology\nStudy Group of Science for the People, 1976). Wilson\u2019s human\nproject might be called \u201cPop Sociobiology\u201d after Kitcher\n(1985). The critics claimed that \u201cPop Sociobiologists\u201d\nwere committed to a form of genetic determinism, an overly strong\nadaptationism and had a tendency to ignore the effects of learning and\nculture.\n\nThe term \u201csociobiology\u201d is also occasionally used to refer\nto current evolutionary approaches to human behavior, which\nretain the behavioral focus to which Wilson refers (Griffiths, 2008;\nSterelny and Griffiths, 1999). However, while influenced by earlier\nsociobiology, most modern projects studying the evolution of behavior\nseem to have developed a variety of theoretical and methodological\nfeatures of their own (Smith et al., 2001; Winterhalder and Smith,\n1992); perhaps the best way to understand sociobiology in this case is\nin \u201cphylogenetic\u201d terms, as a historical ancestor of these\nprojects. The \u201cdescendants\u201d of sociobiology include\nhuman behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology\n(Cosmides and Tooby, 1987) and more recently, dual inheritance\ntheory (Boyd and Richerson, 1985; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman,\n1981). These projects as a group are now sometimes referred to as the\n\u201cevolutionary social sciences\u201d (Smith et al.,\n 2001)[1].\n Over time the different theoretical views and choices of methodology\nhave become entrenched in each project, increasing their disparity;\nthe divisions also partly fall along disciplinary lines, with human\nbehavioral ecologists tending to be anthropologists; evolutionary\npsychologists tending to be cognitive psychologists; and individuals\nworking in dual inheritance theory tending to have some background in\npopulation biology modeling. All three evolutionary social sciences\nretain some of the features of the project that Wilson originally\ndescribed in his book, however; in particular they retain its\nmethodologically adaptationist approach. Of these three, it is human\nbehavioral ecology that is most often called\n\u201csociobiology\u201d due to its focus on the evolution of\nbehavior (evolutionary psychology focuses on the evolution of\npsychological mechanisms or modules such as those for cheater\ndetection; dual inheritance theory studies the cultural evolution of\ntraits that are socially learned).\n\nThis survey will, therefore, focus on three main meanings of\n\u201csociobiology\u201d. First, it will briefly describe the\nrelatively uncontroversial non-human animal behavioral ecology that\nWilson and others described as \u201csociobiology\u201d. Second, it\nwill describe and evaluate the characterization of \u201cPop\nSociobiology\u201d that came under attack by various scientists and\nphilosophers in the mid to late 1970s. Third, it will describe the\nmain features of current human behavioral ecology. The final section\nwill discuss some of the central criticisms raised for sociobiology\nand behavioral ecology in the literature and explore some possible\nresponses to these criticisms.\n", "toc": [{"#SocBehEco": "1.

Sociobiology as Behavioral Ecology\n\nThe first meaning of \u201csociobiology\u201d is a term for a range\nof work that is more often currently referred to as behavioral\necology. Behavioral ecology is a science that uses evolutionary\ntheory and especially adaptationist methods to try to understand\nanimal behavior. Consider, for example the female parasitic jewel\nwasp. This wasp lives and lays its eggs in blowfly pupae; after a\nfemale wasp of this species is born and reaches adulthood she mates\nwith one of the males also occupying her pupa, and then emerges and\nflies off to lay her eggs in another pupa. The jewel wasp is\nhaplodiploid, and females can control the sex of each of their\noffspring by controlling whether or not the egg is fertilized when she\nlays it. What is particularly interesting about this wasp is that the\npercentage of females to males she lays depends on whether she got to\nthe pupa first. If she is first to the pupa she lays a number of eggs,\nwith mostly females (about 91.3%) and some males (about 8.7%).\nHowever, if she lays eggs in a pupa after another female has been\nthere (this is called superparasitism), she lays a lot more\nsons than daughters. Behavioral ecologists are interested in\nunderstanding why animal behaviors like this have the peculiar\nfeatures they do.\n\nBehavioral ecology is sometimes characterized in terms of its\nrelationships to the earlier \u201cethology\u201d whose most famous\npractitioners are probably Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen. Tinbergen\n(1963) famously described four types of questions that an ethologist\nmight ask in trying to understand some pattern of animal behavior,\nsuch as the egg laying strategy of the jewel wasp above. First, the\nethologist could ask questions about the proximate causes of\nthe behavior: for example, what neurological or psychological\nmechanisms lead the wasp to lay her eggs in the pattern she does? What\nmechanisms are responsible for the development of that\nmechanism\u2014what developmental processes build the neural tissue\nthat directly causes the egg laying behavior? Second, the ethologist\ncould ask two ultimate, evolutionary questions about the behavior:\nwhat is the evolutionary function of the behavior, i.e. how\ndoes laying eggs in that pattern contribute to the wasp\u2019s\nreproductive success, to the reproductive success of its ancestors,\nand hence to the behavior\u2019s history of evolution by natural\nselection (if that is its history) in the jewel wasp population? Also,\nwhat is the phylogeny of the behavior, i.e. where did it\narise in the evolutionary tree of the jewel wasp?\n\nUnlike ethologists, behavioral ecologists studying animal behavior at\nfirst tended to focus on the third question, the question of\nevolutionary function, at the expense of the others (Griffiths, 2008;\nKrebs and Davies, 1997). Griffiths (2008) has argued such a focus by\nthe behavioral ecologists on questions of function at the expense of\nquestions of causation, development and phylogeny (but especially\ndevelopment) was highly problematic, since the four questions cannot\nbe properly answered independently. Development constrains the\nevolution of biological traits in multiple ways, and behavior\nespecially, since behavior depends on development at both neurological\nand psychological levels. Behavioral ecologists, however, for a long\ntime took the complexity of the developmental resources contributing\nto behavior as a reason for (at least temporarily) avoiding such\nstudies as part of their study of the evolution of behavior. Grafen\n(1984) argues that the problem with developmental approaches to\nbehavior is that they are hard and lengthy to perform, especially if\nthe only or primary purpose of the developmental\nwork is to check that the trait in question does indeed have an\nevolutionary history that can be understood using adaptationist\nmethods. Grafen argues that if behavioral ecologists had to perform\ndevelopmental or psychological studies to be relatively confident of\ntheir conclusions about the evolutionary history of traits, they would\nprobably never get as far as evolutionary studies, since such\ndevelopmental and genetic work would take a very long time. Worse,\nsuch studies might well have no inherent interest of their own and\nrepresent a waste of time and resources for the scientist\u2014not\nall traits have an interesting or enlightening developmental\nbackground or are produced by interesting and unknown psychological\nmechanisms. Instead, Grafen argues that behavioral ecologists should\nuse what he calls the \u201cphenotypic gambit\u201d in studying the\nevolution of behavioral traits. This involves assuming that the\ndevelopmental, psychological and genetic proximate causes of a\nbehavioral trait, such as the jewel wasp\u2019s egg-laying strategy\nare of a type that will permit scientists to \u201cpretend\u201d\nthat they are very straightforward when building evolutionary models,\nand yet still end up with models that give approximately the right\nanswers about the primary processes, conditions and constraints acting\non that trait during its evolution (for another similar view see\nMaynard Smith, 1982, 6ff).\n\nSince Grafen wrote his article, however, there has been a certain\nshift in non-human behavioral ecology away from the phenotypic gambit\nand in favor of paying attention to proximate mechanisms, not simply\nbecause these enlighten whether a behavioral strategy could evolve by\nnatural selection in any particular case, but also the nature of the\nfitness costs and benefits that accrue to an organism sometimes depend\non how the adaptive problem they face is solved. For example, Lotem et\nal. (1995) appeal to the type of learning mechanism used by parenting\ngreat reed warblers to detect the presence of cuckoos in their nests:\nthis limits how reliable their detection of cuckoo eggs can be.\nSimilarly, Shuker and West (2004) argue that the constraints on the\negg laying strategy of the parasitic jewel wasp cannot be properly\nunderstood without paying attention to the limits on the detection\nmechanisms the wasp uses to determine the presence or absence of\nother females, versus other females\u2019 eggs in\neach area.\n\nPerhaps the most important analytical tool of the behavioral ecologist\nis the optimality model (Maynard Smith, 1978): however,\nfrequency dependent models, which do not assume population fixation of\na trait, such as evolutionary stable strategy models (Maynard Smith,\n1982) (see also the entry on\n evolutionary game theory)\n and dynamic models, such those employed in studying life history\ntraits (Roff, 1992), are also used. Optimality models are designed to\nshow which of a set of possible variant behavioral strategies would\nmaximize a local fitness\n currency[2]\n under a range of ecological conditions and constraints implicitly or\nexplicitly represented in the mathematical structure of the model.\nThese conditions are supposed to represent the selection\nconditions of the trait (the conditions responsible for driving\nits evolution by natural selection \u2013 Brandon, 1990); however,\nthey are usually derived by observing the conditions under which the\norganism is currently living, since these are assumed generally to\nhave remained much the same as the conditions under which the organism\nevolved (Turke, 1990). Werren (1980) provided just such a model for\nthe jewel wasp above; the model suggests that the reason for the\nchange in the ratio of sons to daughters when a female wasp finds an\noccupied pupa is due to the potential opportunity to mate with the\ndaughters of the first wasp. If only the first wasp lays her eggs on\nthe pupa, then the hatching daughters mate with their brothers and all\ntheir offspring are entirely descendants of the first wasp. This means\nthe first wasp needs to produce very few sons\u2014only enough to\nmate with all the females; the second generation reproductive success\nof the first wasp is maximized by maximizing the number of daughters.\nHowever, where there is a superparasitic wasp, the superparasitic\nwasp\u2019s sons can mate with the large numbers of daughters of the\nfirst wasp. The superparasitic wasp needs to maximize the number of\nthe females in the pupa that breed with her sons as opposed to their\nbrothers, whilst at the same time limiting the amount of competition\namongst her sons. So if she has only a few eggs to lay, it makes sense\nfor her to lay almost all sons; as brood sizes grow larger, it makes\nsense to gradually increase the proportion of daughters in the mix.\nWerren calculated the optimal percentages of males and females for\neach brood size. His observations of male to female ratios fit the\npredictions of this model quite well but not perfectly.\n\nThere is some debate among various philosophers and behavioral\necologists about what exactly optimality models like Werren\u2019s\nare being used to demonstrate. Orzack and Sober (1994) claim that\nbehavioral ecologists like Werren use optimality models to demonstrate\nthat the traits in question are adaptations, i.e. that the traits have\nevolved by natural selection. Furthermore, Orzack and Sober take\noptimality models to be censored models, that is, they are\ndesigned to determine the outcome of natural selection in a population\nwhere natural selection is the only important force, and hence show,\ngiven the model correctly predicts the observed features of the trait\nbeing studied, that natural selection was the most important force in\nits\n evolution[3].\n The idea then, is that the relative success of Werren\u2019s model\nis supposed to demonstrate that natural selection was the most\nimportant force in the evolution of the jewel wasp\u2019s egg-laying\nstrategy\u2014other forces may have been involved, but they are not\nas causally important. However, various other philosophers have argued\nthat such models do not make such strongly adaptationist assumptions;\nPotochnik (2009), for example, argues that optimality models are only\ndesigned to show the general role that natural selection and other\nforces (such as developmental constraints) are playing, and are not\ndesigned to test strong adaptationist hypotheses about the behavioral\nstrategies in question\u2014i.e. in our case above, the success of\nthe model is intended to show that natural selection was acting on the\njewel wasp\u2019s strategy, and that the way it was acting\non the jewel wasp\u2019s strategy was via the effects of competition\nbetween the male wasps in the pupa, the variations in brood size and\nthe other conditions and constraints to which Werren\u2019s model\nappeals. The success of the model is not intended to show\nthat natural selection was the only important force involved in the\nevolution of the jewel wasp\u2019s strategy. For other criticisms of\nthe censored model view, see Rice (2012) and Bolduc and Cezilly\n(2012).\n\nHowever, interestingly, some behavioral ecologists have claimed that\nthey do not use optimality models to test whether or not natural\nselection is acting on a trait, but instead assume the operation of\nnatural selection in order to test hypotheses about the conditions and\nconstraints acting on the trait (Parker and Maynard Smith, 1990). This\ncould be problematic, if it means behavioral ecologists baldly accept\nthe view that natural selection optimizes most traits and never\nproperly test this claim. However, one interpretation of Parker and\nMaynard Smith (1990) is not that behavioral ecologists have an\nunfalsifiable commitment to the idea that natural selection is an\noptimizer. Instead, they are claiming that testing hypotheses about\nthe operation of natural selection itself is not what the behavioral\necologists are focusing on. The behavioral ecologists are making the\npreliminary assumption that a trait is an adaptation in order to test\nother hypotheses about it\u2014they \u201cpretend as if\u201d the\ntrait were an adaptation, and use that assumption to detect\ndeviations from optimality that might reveal interesting\ntradeoffs and constraints\u2014the nature of the deviation can\nsuggest what might be missing from the model. This of course has the\nupshot that when the models initially fail, the scientists do not look\nfor alternative non-adaptationist hypotheses, but instead\ninitially look for new constraints, tradeoffs and conditions\nunder which selection might be operating. For example, Giraldeau\n(1997) describes deviations from optimality in the evolution of\nphotopigments in the rods (as opposed to cones) in the retinas of fish\nthat live in certain sorts of marine environments where a shift in\nphotosensitivity would be useful; Giraldeau uses this deviation to\nsuggest the presence of a molecular constraint on the evolution of the\nrod cells. Presumably, repeated failures to find ways to fill in the\ngaps in these optimality models could ultimately result in the\nscientists concerned considering alternative, non-adaptationist\nexplanations. So in order for the behavioral ecologists do this work\nthey do not need to be committed to the strong view that natural\nselection is always the most important force in the origin of traits;\nthis heuristic requires at most the view that natural selection\nusually locally optimizes (i.e. optimizes only relative to\npossibly severe constraints).\n\nHowever, another way to understand how the behavioral ecologists are\nusing optimality models, one that is not so often considered, is that\nthey are interested in providing a functional description of\nthe traits they are studying (Kitcher, 1987; see also Bolduc and\nCezilly, 2012, for a similar view in terms of decision patterns rather\nthan behavioral strategies). One of the things that may concern a\nbehavioral ecologist is how exactly to describe the nature of the\nbehavior that they are considering: what component behavioral\ndispositions (from among all of the organism\u2019s behavior) make up\neach strategy, and how those dispositions hang together as an\nadaptation. They need to give a description of the relationship\nbetween the organism\u2019s behavior and its environment, and how it\ncontributes to the organism\u2019s fitness. In the jewel wasp case,\nthe behavioral ecologists have observed the wasps lay different egg\nsex ratios on different occasions. The question is how to make sense\nof these different sex-ratio laying behaviors: the guess is that these\ndifferent behaviors hang together somehow, as manifestations of a\nparticular egg-sex-ratio adjusting strategy; and that having this\nparticular strategy, this particular pattern of egg-sex-ratio laying\nbehavior, does something for the female wasp when considered\nas a whole. But why should a behavioral ecologist accept that any\nparticular such a functional description is true?\n\nAn optimality model can allow a behavioral ecologist to find and test\nsuch a functional description in two ways. First, an optimality model\n(explicitly or implicitly) includes a strategy set, which is\na set of descriptions of possible behavioral strategies; the model\npicks out one of these strategy descriptions as the one that is\nmaximally adaptive. On Werren\u2019s model, the strategy set would be\nan (implicit) set of descriptions of the range of possible sex-ratio\nadjusting strategies that a jewel wasp could use (i.e. each strategy\ninvolves a different set of choices about sex ratios in a full\nrange of relevant conditions like parasitism, superparasitism and\ndifferent brood sizes). The idea is that an optimality model can pick\nout which member of this set is a description of the maximally\nadaptive strategy \u2013 on this view of what the behavioral\necologists are doing, Werren\u2019s model is designed to pick out the\noptimal sex ratio egg laying strategy description from the strategy\nset. The hypothesis is that this description of the maximally\nadaptive strategy will be the correct description of\nwhat the wasp is doing. If it is the correct description, then Werren\ncan now predict what son/daughter ratios he should see the wasp lay in\ncases so far unobserved. These predictions allow him to test if the\ndescription is correct \u2013 if these predictions are true, then on\nthis view, Werren has confirmed that the description of the particular\nsex-ratio adjusting strategy derived from his model is the correct\ndescription of what the wasp is doing.\n\nSecond, the description of the strategy picked out by the model is not\nsimply a description of it as a series of behavioral dispositions\n(i.e. dispositions to lay different sex ratios under different\nconditions), but of the relationships between those dispositions and\nvarious ecological features that determine the fitness of those\ndispositions. For example, in the jewel wasp case, the presence of\nother female competitors, flexibility in brood size, the capacity of\nsons to mate multiple times, the impossibility of migration of sons\nbetween pupae and so on, are features of the environment that\ndetermine whether any potential egg laying strategy of the jewel wasp\nis maximally adaptive, and a well confirmed optimality model can show\nhow. Consequently, contingent on obtaining the appropriate evidence\nthat this is the correct model, the description of the strategy given\nby a successful model is (implicitly or explicitly) a\nfunctional description of the strategy\u2014a description of\nhow the behavior contributes to the fitness of the organism. For a\nmore detailed discussion of the role of optimality modeling in\nbiology, see the entry on\n adaptationism.\n2. \u201cPop Sociobiology\u201d\n\nThe second way that \u201csociobiology\u201d has come to be\nunderstood is as a particular approach to understanding specifically\nhuman behavior which Philip Kitcher (1985) calls \u201cPop\nSociobiology\u201d (as opposed to his description of \u201cnarrow\nsociobiology\u201d which is roughly equivalent to \u201cbehavioral\necology\u201d above). Pop Sociobiology is so-called because it is a\nview about how to study human behavior described in a variety of\nliterature written by Wilson and\n others[4]\n for a general, rather than an academic audience. In this literature,\nWilson and the other \u201cPop sociobiologists\u201d present some\nspeculative and\n preliminary[5]\n sketches of how an evolutionary science of human behavior might\nproceed: Wilson\u2019s main focus in On Human Nature\n(Wilson, 1978) and to a lesser extent the last chapter of\nSociobiology (Wilson, 1975) is to show that such a science is\npossible, to describe some of the techniques that might be used in\npursuing it, and to sketch some possible evolutionary analyses for\ncertain particular human behaviors. Because of its presentation in the\npopular press, \u201cPop Sociobiology\u201d was probably important\nin shaping popular perceptions of the nature of sociobiology in\ngeneral (for example, the Time article, \u201cWhy you do\nwhat you do\u201d 1977, 110 (Aug 1), 54) and consequently drew the\nire of the critics. Unfortunately, the intensity of this debate may\nhave led to a certain amount of mischaracterization of the\nsociobiologists\u2019 views. This section will address the main\nconcerns that the critics raised about Wilson\u2019s early\n\u201cPop\u201d sociobiology, and discuss whether and how far these\nare fair descriptions of his views.\n\nGenetic determinism. In a variety of articles major critics\nof sociobiology such as Stephen J. Gould (1977, 251\u2013259; 1978)\nand the so-called \u201cSociobiology Study Group\u201d (hereafter\nSSG) (Allen et al., 1975; Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the\nPeople, 1976) claim that sociobiologists are strong genetic\ndeterminists. For example, according to the SSG Wilson believes that\nthere are particular genes \u201cfor\u201d behavioral traits,\nincluding indoctrinability, territoriality, warfare and reciprocal\naltruism, and that these genes are subject to natural selection in a\nrelatively straightforward way. Indeed, the SSG (1976) argue that\nclaiming that traits have a selective origin requires that there are\ngenes \u201cfor\u201d them; Wilson\u2019s apparent acceptance that\ntraits may often have a strong cultural component is said to be an\nerror, since if this is true then evolutionary theory tells us nothing\nabout the origin of such traits. Gould (1977) similarly claims that\nsociobiologists do not realize that genes only produce traits with a\ncontribution from the environment.\n\nBoth of these claims are believed, even by other critics, to be unfair\nanalyses of the views of the sociobiologists, and especially\nWilson\u2014for example, Kitcher, one of the strongest critics of\nsociobiology, takes Gould and the SSG to task on this point (Kitcher,\n1985, 22\u201323). In On Human Nature Wilson describes genes\nas, essentially, difference makers\u2014he explicitly claims that\ndifferences in genes, even for heritable traits, only explain the\nvariance in traits across a population; they are by no means\nindependent causes for any trait in individuals and variation in the\nenvironment also accounts for part of the variation in any trait\n(Wilson, 1978, 19). In at least one paper responding to the SSG Wilson\nsays that, on the question of the relative contributions to the\nvariation in human behavior from variation in genes vs. variation in\nthe environment, his \u201cown views lie closer to the\nenvironmentalist than the genetic pole\u201d (Wilson, 1976, 183).\nWilson also does seem to be trying to support his claim that there are\nsome human behaviors which are probably highly heritable: he describes\na variety of different sorts of evidence that might identify them.\nThis evidence includes cross cultural appearance (e.g. Wilson, 1975,\n550; Wilson, 1978, 20, 129); plausible homology with other closely\nrelated species (especially chimpanzees) (e.g. 1978, 20, 27, 151);\nearly development of the trait in question (e.g. 1975, 551; 1978,\n129); differences between individuals that arise without differences\nin their developmental environment (e.g. 1978, 128\u2013130); genetic\nsyndromes that cause behavioral differences (e.g. 1978, 43\u201345);\nand twin studies (e.g. 1978, 145). Finally, Wilson claims that trying\nto change human behavior from its heritable form usually fails or\ncauses misery (Wilson, 1978,\n 20)[6];\n he describes the failures of certain attempts to change the features\nof normal human behavior by massively changing the social environment,\nsuch as the persistence of family ties under slavery (Wilson, 1978,\n136) and in the Israeli kibbutzim (1978, 134). Of course, whether or\nnot all of the above is good evidence for his claims is very much up\nfor debate (Kitcher, 1985; Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the\nPeople, 1976). It is worth bearing in mind that while Wilson thinks\nthe evidence that some human behaviors are heritable is overwhelming\n(Wilson, 1978, 19) he does see many of his specific proposed\nevolutionary explanations as preliminary and speculative rather than\nfully formed (for example, Wilson is explicit that his discussion of\nhomosexuality is preliminary: 1978, 146). For more discussion of the\nproblems relating to heritability when studying the evolution of\nbehavior, see section 4.2. below and the entry on\n heritability.\n\nIgnoring learning and culture. As a concomitant of the\nobjection that Pop Sociobiology was committed to genetic determinism,\nits central players are also often accused of being insensitive to the\nproblem of learning and culture, i.e. to the problem that many traits\nin which they are interested are simply not subject to natural\nselection at all, and that this state of affairs may indeed be common\nin humans (Kitcher, 1985; Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the\nPeople, 1976). However, Wilson, for example, clearly recognized the\nimportant role of culture in many behavioral traits (Wilson, 1976);\nindeed, he thought that even minor genetic differences that made a\ndifference in behavior could be exaggerated by acquired\nculture\u2014this is the so-called \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d\n(although it is seriously in question whether the multiplier effect\nworks \u2013 Maynard Smith and Warren, 1982). Furthermore, partly in\nresponse to these concerns on the part of his critics Wilson\neventually went on to publish Genes, Minds and Culture with\nCharles Lumsden (Lumsden and Wilson, 1981), which was an attempt to\nconsider the effects of cultural transmission on the nature and spread\nof behavioral traits, and of the interaction between genes and\nculture. The book, however, was subject to heavy criticism (see, for\nexample, Kitcher, 1985; Lewontin, 1981; Maynard Smith and Warren,\n1982). The main concern raised was that there was little substance in\nthe models the book provided\u2014the most interesting features of\nthese simply followed from the assumptions built into them, in\nparticular, assumptions about the degree to which genes kept culture\n\u201con a leash\u201d (Lumsden and Wilson, 1981, 13; Wilson, 1978,\n167).\n\nStrong adaptationism. The third problematic feature ascribed\nto Pop Sociobiology was its reliance on an overly strong form of\nadaptationism. In both papers by the SSG (1976) and by Gould and\nLewontin in their famous \u201cSpandrels of San Marco\u201d paper\n(Gould and Lewontin, 1979), the critics of sociobiology argue that\nsociobiologists are committed to a \u201cPanglossian\u201d\nadaptationism. While the \u201cSpandrels\u201d paper is directed at\n\u201cadaptationists\u201d generally, sociobiologists were some of\nits clear targets (for example, David Barash\u2019s (1976) work on\njealousy in male bluebirds).\n\nThe central accusations of the \u201cSpandrels\u201d paper were as\nfollows: that adaptationists treat all traits as adaptations; that\nwhen \u201catomizing\u201d individuals into traits to study they\ntake no care to establish that the traits so atomized could actually\nindependently evolve by natural selection; that they ignore\ndevelopmental constraints on evolution; that they fail to identify\ntraits that are prevalent due to causes other than natural selection;\nthat they fail to distinguish between current adaptiveness and a past\nhistory of natural selection; that they generate adaptationist\nhypotheses, fail to test them properly and replace one such hypothesis\nwith another, ignoring other interesting kinds of evolutionary and\nnon-evolutionary explanation. Instead, according to Gould and\nLewontin, adaptationists tell purely speculative, untestable\n\u201cjust so\u201d stories and present them as science fact.\n\nAgain, insofar as Wilson and other sociobiologists are being purely\nspeculative this criticism may be warranted: quite a lot of the\nevolutionary explanations of particular human behaviors Wilson\ndescribes in the first and last chapters of Sociobiology and\nin On Human Nature are speculation on his part\n(although not entirely speculation). Perhaps the speculative\nadaptationist stories are appropriately described as \u201cjust so\nstories\u201d; the question is whether such stories, treated\nas preliminary hypotheses, are problematic in themselves. Furthermore,\nwhile Wilson made no attempt to test any of his speculative\nhypotheses, behavioral ecologists do try to test adaptationist\nhypotheses about humans and other animals. Again, the proper question\nis whether these tests are appropriate or sufficient to establish the\ntruth of the hypotheses in question. Gould and Lewontin do, however,\nmake some more sophisticated objections to adaptationist methods; some\nof these will be discussed in Section 4.\n3. Sociobiology as Human Behavioral Ecology\n\nHuman behavioral ecology (HBE), or human evolutionary ecology, is the\ncurrent evolutionary social science most closely related to\nWilson\u2019s sociobiological project; it is the project that is\nsometimes still referred to as \u201csociobiology\u201d by some\nphilosophers of science (Griffiths, 2008; Sterelny and Griffiths,\n1999). \u201cSociobiology\u201d is most often used this way as a\nterm of contrast with \u201cevolutionary psychology\u201d, another\ncurrent evolutionary social science project inspired by early\nsociobiologists, and also much developed from how early sociobiology\nwas conceived: see the entry on\n evolutionary psychology\n for a discussion. Other common names for HBE are \u201cevolutionary\nanthropology\u201d (Smith, 2000) or \u201cDarwinian ecological\nanthropology\u201d (Vayda, 1995) (due to most of its practitioners\nhaving a background in, or being based in anthropology departments,\nand using anthropological fieldwork as the main means of testing their\nhypotheses about human behavior). The different names tend to be used\nwhen the researchers concerned are emphasizing the connections of\ntheir field with anthropology or with non-human behavioral ecology.\nHBE has a great deal in common with the non-human behavioral ecology\ndescribed above. In particular, it shares its focus on behavior,\nrather than the psychological mechanisms described in evolutionary\npsychology. Unlike non-human behavioral ecology it has continued to\nuse Grafen\u2019s (1984) phenotypic gambit, in that its practitioners\nusually do not attempt to discover or describe the genetic or other\nresources employed in the development of the behavior in which they\nare interested; nor, for that matter, do they usually attempt to\ndiscover the underlying psychology. There are, however, some\ndifferences of emphasis, in that the questions about human behavior\naddressed by the human behavioral ecologists (HBEs) are sometimes\ndifferent from those addressed by the non-human behavioral\necologists.\n\nTo understand the purposes of the HBE project, let\u2019s consider one\nof its classic examples: Kaplan and Hill\u2019s (1992) work on prey\nchoice strategies amongst the Ache foragers of Paraguay. Just as in\nnon-human behavioral ecology, behavioral strategies in HBE are usually\ndescribed as complex behavioral dispositions. Behavioral dispositions\ninvolve behavioral responses to local stimuli; behavioral strategies\nthen involve producing a set of different responses to a set of\ndifferent stimuli (i.e. the response conditions of the\nstrategy). According to Kaplan and Hill, the Ache prey choice strategy\ninvolves choosing a variety of different potential prey items from the\nenvironment; whether or not a prey item is taken depends on a number\nof circumstances acting as the response conditions: for example, the\npresence of prey with certain specific features, such as the caloric\nreturn of the prey given the time necessary to process it (known as\nthe profitability); the rate at which that prey occurs in the\nenvironment; whether or not the prey is encountered on their search;\nand the search time available on a foraging trip. HBEs usually\ndescribe behavioral strategies in terms of an \u201cepigenetic\u201d\nor decision rule, which is usually given as a mathematical function\nmapping values for the response conditions in the environment onto the\nappropriate values for the parameters of the behavioral output. Kaplan\nand Hill\u2019s work also provides such an epigenetic rule (see\nKaplan and Hill, 1992, 170), which describes the relationships between\nsearch time, profitability and so on, to decide which prey will be\ntaken on encounter when the Ache are out foraging. Kaplan and\nHill\u2019s observations suggest that, on the whole, the Ache are using\na strategy which is close to the maximally adaptive strategy suggested\nby their prey choice model. The question, then, is how to interpret\nKaplan and Hill\u2019s method; what is the purpose of showing that the\nAche have a strategy of this kind?\n\nIn a few places, remarks by human behavioral ecologists suggest that\nthe purpose of HBE is simply to demonstrate that human behavior is\nmaximally adaptive: for example, Smith et al. (2001, 128) claim that\n\u201c\u2026 human behavioral ecology applies the theoretical perspective\nof animal behavioral ecology to human populations, examining the\ndegree to which behavior is adaptively adjusted to environmental\n(including social) conditions\u201d. One possible interpretation of HBE\nwork, therefore, is that they test the hypothesis that human behavior\nis adaptive (in contrast to the hypothesis that it consists of\nadaptations). By using methods derived from non-human behavioral\necology (such as optimality and game theoretic models), HBEs can\ndemonstrate that the behaviors humans actually engage in tend to be\noptimal relative to the constraints and tradeoffs acting on them (i.e.\nthey are \u201clocally optimal\u201d). Kaplan and Hill seek to\ndemonstrate that the Ache\u2019s prey choice behavior is in fact\nadaptive, as do other HBE studies that use the same method. On this\ninterpretation, an important purpose of the project is to deflect some\nof the criticisms directed at Pop Sociobiology: HBEs explicitly accept\nthat social learning of general purpose reasoning may be responsible\nfor human behavioral strategies such as the Ache\u2019s. However, this\nis ultimately irrelevant; one way or another, natural selection has,\nin effect, \u201cseen to it\u201d that humans behave in ways that tend\nto maximize their reproductive success. This is also consistent with\nthe HBEs\u2019 emphasis on the phenotypic gambit.\n\nAlternatively, however, one could take these remarks to be a\ndescription of the HBEs primary method rather than the nature of their\nhypotheses, and that their hypotheses are (as the above quote also\nsuggests) similar to those of non-human behavioral ecology. This is\nconsistent with other theoretical discussions of HBE work including\nsome by the same authors\u2014see for example, Irons (1998), Smith\n(2000), Winterhalder and Smith (1992). On this interpretation, the\npurpose of Kaplan and Hill\u2019s work is to test the hypothesis that\nhumans have a behavioral adaptation for prey choice, of which the\nAche\u2019s prey choice strategy is only a local\nmanifestation. Showing that the Ache\u2019s behavior is highly\nadaptive is supposed to be a local test of the hypothesis: the Ache\nare a group that have to engage in prey choice and hence it is\npossible to test for a human behavioral adaptation in this context. By\nconfirming this hypothesis, Kaplan and Hill can then achieve two\nfurther goals: they can determine which conditions led to the\nevolution of the larger prey choice strategy and, by confirming a\nfunctional description of that strategy, they can determine what\ncauses the Ache (specifically) to choose the prey they do in their\nlocal environment.\n\nOn this interpretation, the prey choice strategy as a whole (i.e. not,\nfor example, the Ache\u2019s specific, locally appropriate\nset of prey choices, but the general human prey choice strategy of\nwhich they are a manifestation) is presumed for heuristic purposes to\nbe an adaptation to certain conditions in the past that led to that\nstrategy being selected for; i.e. the selection conditions\nfor the strategy. Supposing that it is reasonable to take behavioral\nstrategies as such to be able to be adaptations (see the later\ndiscussion in section 4) the selection conditions of a given\nbehavioral strategy will usually include the response conditions\n(because presumably it takes the production of overt behavior in order\nfor selection to act on a behavioral strategy) but possibly also\nfeatures of the larger context which made it highly adaptive to\nrespond in that way to those response conditions. In other words, in\nthe prey choice case, profitabilities, prey densities and search time\navailability would presumably have been among the selection conditions\nof a prey choice strategy (presuming it is an adaptation). But so\nwould larger details about the environment not explicitly included in\nthese models, such as the limits on human capacity which determine\nwhich prey are accessible in that environment, the ecology which\ndetermines which prey are in the environment, and so on. On this\ninterpretation, therefore, HBEs are interested in identifying the\nselection conditions of human behavioral strategies; this parallels\nstandard interpretations of non-human behavioral ecology described\nearlier.\n\nHowever, HBEs are anthropologists, and hence also want to describe the\nlocal causes of the overt behaviors they observe people engaging in in\ntheir fieldwork; this can be done by identifying the local\nmanifestations of the response conditions of the strategies those\npeople are using. Identifying these response conditions is a matter of\nidentifying the correct functional description of those strategies\n(Kitcher, 1987). So how might such strategies he described? It is\nworth pointing out that this is quite difficult to do: what HBEs\nobserve in the field is sets of overt behaviors in a context of a\nvariety of ecological conditions any of which could be the response\nconditions. It may be far from obvious exactly why those behaviors are\noccurring, and which local conditions are the stimuli to which the\nbehavior is a response. Indeed, it may not even be obvious which overt\nbehaviors are manifestations of the same strategy. In the Ache case,\nwhat Kaplan and Hill observed is not a complete prey choice strategy,\nbut a variety of occasions on which individuals or groups of Ache\npeople took or did not take prey they encountered whilst out foraging,\namong many other sorts of foraging and other types of behaviors. The\nquestion is which, if any, of the overt behaviors on these occasions\nmanifested a single prey choice strategy, and how these overt\nbehaviors are related to each other and to the environmental\nconditions in which they occur. If human behavioral strategies are\nadaptations, however, then the relationships between behavioral\nresponses and local ecological conditions that resemble those of the\nhuman evolutionary past can be expected to be locally optimal,\nceteris paribus; this means that the response conditions of\nthe strategy will (allegedly) be those (along with additional\nplausible selection conditions) that made the behavior fitness\nmaximizing in the environment in which it evolved, and in any\nenvironment that is relevantly similar (Irons, 1998). This permits the\nHBEs to pick out the correct description of the strategy using an\noptimality model; identifying the causes of the Ache\u2019s behavior in\nparticular is a matter of identifying how the response conditions of\nthat strategy manifest locally in their environment. \n\nHBEs, like behavioral ecologists studying non-human animals, tend to\nuse optimality modeling to find strategy descriptions and sets of\nplausible selection conditions that make sense of observed patterns of\nbehavior as locally optimal adaptations, and the reasoning works in\nmuch the same way. However, there are a few differences, most notably\nin how models are chosen. In cases where the structure of the problem\nmight be unique to the human case and where the current environment is\nexpected to be different from the situation under which the strategy\noriginally evolved, the model HBEs choose will often be unique and at\nleast some of the proposed selection conditions identified by\nappealing to information about the fossil record. A nice example might\nbe human life history, where the human situation is relatively unique:\nfor example, compared to other primates humans have unusually long\nlives and childhoods, and long life after menopause. As a consequence,\nthe human behavioral ecologists have to appeal to the fossil record in\ndetail to determine what sorts of evolutionary transitions might have\nbeen involved (Hawkes, 2003; Kaplan et al., 2000). Where the structure\nof the adaptive problem humans face and the conditions acting on their\nbehavior is expected to mirror those in non-human animals and to be\nvery similar to those humans encountered in their evolutionary past,\nthe choice of model is often a standard one from non-human behavioral\necology; the proposed selection conditions can be based on the current\nconditions observed in foraging societies. In the Ache foraging case,\nthis is exactly what happens: the prey choice models used by Kaplan\nand Hill are those used to understand similar sorts of strategies in\nnon-human animals. This is because Kaplan and Hill expect the relevant\nconditions acting on human prey choice\u2014such as profitabilities and\nsearch times\u2014to mirror very closely those acting on non-human\nanimals.\n\nSome differences also arise in how models are tested in HBE verses\nnon-human animal behavioral ecology. The description of that strategy\npicked out by the model will usually include descriptions of potential\nbehavioral responses to conditions (or values for parameters of those\nresponses) that go beyond what has already been observed; this means\nthe model predicts that these responses should also occur if the\ndescription of the strategy is correct. For example, in Kaplan and\nHill\u2019s prey choice case, the model predicts patterns of Ache\nprey choice that the observers had not yet seen, such as which prey\nthe Ache should and should not take on encounter and under what\ncircumstances. The model, therefore, can be tested by looking for a\nsituation in which the response conditions of the strategy obtain and\nobserving whether the behavior in response to those conditions is as\nthe model suggests. This is partly why such rules are tested in\nforaging societies\u2014because many of these strategies have\nresponse conditions which reflect conditions presumed to be present in\nthe human evolutionary past, and which may obtain in foraging\nsocieties but not in industrial of agricultural societies. For\nexample, obviously in Kaplan and Hill\u2019s foraging case, few if\nany industrial or agricultural societies routinely engage in foraging\nthat is a primary source of nutrition, and hence don\u2019t present\nan opportunity for individuals to do prey choice of the right\ntype. The other reason for performing these tests in foraging\nsocieties is because the HBEs want to understand the local causes of\novert behavior in these societies in particular.\n\nHowever, just as in non-human behavioral ecology, differences between\nthe predicted and described behavioral strategies require scientists\nto build new models, or suggest additional conditions or constraints\nto add to the original models; there must be independent evidence that\nthese conditions or constraints obtain. Kaplan and Hill\u2019s\nobservations do depart from what their model predicts: the Ache engage\nin a number of prey choice decisions that are not obviously fitness\nmaximizing. In particular, men often seem to ignore many calorie rich\nfood sources from plants and sometimes smaller animals, and women do\nnot pursue larger game. The question then is how to proceed: HBEs\noften suggest changes to the model that might account for these\nfailures of prediction; often, they do give some independent evidence\nfor their suggestions. For example, one of Hawkes\u2019 proposed\nexplanations for why male hunting behavior often fails to meet prey\nchoice expectations (similar failures are found in many societies\nbesides the Ache) is that men pursue large game for reasons other than\nmerely collecting calories\u2014they are also interested in showing\noff in order to get other fitness rewards, such as additional sexual\npartners or better alliances with other men. Hawkes was able to show\nthat men\u2019s prey choice decisions were consistent with this view\n(Hawkes, 1991).\n4. Central criticisms of Sociobiology and Behavioral Ecology\n\nThere are a number of philosophical criticisms of behavioral ecology\nand its methods; this section will address some of these\ncriticisms.\n4.1 Adaptationism\n\nPerhaps the most important of all of the criticisms of \u201cPop\nSociobiology\u201d was that it was excessively adaptationist; similar\nsorts of criticisms are leveled at modern descendants of sociobiology,\nsuch as behavioral ecology. Behavioral ecologists, including HBEs, are\nreally methodological adaptationists (Godfrey Smith, 2001), in that\nthey assume that natural selection is optimizing the trait they are\nstudying as a heuristic, in order to establish other things about that\ntrait; as such, no strong commitment about the power of natural\nselection is necessarily required on their part (as discussed\nearlier). This did lead many behavioral ecologists to regard Gould and\nLewontin\u2019s (1979) criticisms as a cautionary tale, rather than\nas properly directed at them\u2014see, for example, Gould and\nLewontin\u2019s objection that adaptationist hypotheses were\nuntestable, which the behavioral ecologists could easily rebut (Mayr,\n1983). Similarly, Parker and Maynard Smith (1990) responded to Gould\nand Lewontin\u2019s objection that adaptationists do not properly\naccount for phylogenetic and developmental constraints; Parker and\nMaynard Smith argued that they are taken into account\u2014even where\ndevelopmental constraints and tradeoffs are not explicitly represented\nin optimality models, they are often built into the strategy set or\nare otherwise implicit in those models. However, it is reasonable to\npoint out that Parker and Maynard Smith\u2019s paper did not fully\nrespond to Gould and Lewontin\u2019s objection: Gould and Lewontin\nrecognized that adaptationist models appeal to constraints; their\nworry was that such constraints are appealed to ad hoc to\nfill in gaps in models, and are not subjected to any external\ntest.\n\nAnother objection to adaptationist methods from Gould and Lewontin\nthat has persisted as a criticism of behavioral ecology is that these\nmethods do not allow scientists to consider non-adaptationist\nexplanations for the traits to which they are applied, such as whether\nthose traits were fixed by drift or are simply side effects of other\ntraits (i.e. whether they are \u201cspandrels\u201d). In principle,\ncorrectly pursued, adaptationist methods can help identify cases where\na trait is a non-adaptation: drift, for example, can be identified by\ncomparing the distribution of traits expected under selection and\nunder drift with actual population distributions (Sober, 2005); the\nquestion is whether the types of methods used in behavioral ecology\nare the most efficient at detecting these cases (Lewens, 2009). Some\nphilosophers have argued that methodological adaptationism is more\npernicious in practice than it looks in principle, because real\nevolutionary social scientists are not good at dropping adaptationist\nhypotheses for a trait even when there is a strong case to be made\nthat they should (see, for example, Lloyd, 2005, esp. Chapter 8). For\nfurther discussion of all these problems, see the entry on\n adaptationism.\n4.2 The Heritability of Behavioral Traits\n\nWhile it seems that the accusation that the early \u201cPop\u201d\nsociobiologists were genetic determinists was probably unfair, there\nis a related objection that can be raised to both \u201cPop\u201d\nsociobiology and to the later forms of human and non-human behavioral\necology, i.e. that any trait\u2019s being an adaptation requires that\nthat trait be heritable, and most human behaviors are not\nheritable. To say a trait is heritable in the simplest sense is just\nto say that if the parent has that trait, then the trait tends also to\nappear in the offspring (i.e. to say the trait is heritable simply\nmeans that the trait is inherited reliably). The more\ndemanding population genetic definition of heritability is that a\nheritable trait T is one where variation in T can be accounted for\nprimarily by variation in genes as opposed to variation in the\nenvironment (see also the entry on\n heritability).\n Heritability in this sense is supposed to be required for natural\nselection because in order for natural selection to spread a variant T\nin a population, when T increases the average number of offspring of\nits possessors, those offspring have to reliably also have T if T is\nto spread at the expense of the other variants. The problem, however,\nis that many human behavioral traits do not seem likely to be\nheritable in this way: they tend to vary greatly across and even\nwithin cultures and environments, whereas human genetic variation is\nmuch too low to account for such differences (Buller, 2005; Cosmides\nand Tooby, 1987).\n\nHowever, HBEs can get around this problem, by pointing out that local\npatterns of overt behavior are manifestations of more general\nstrategies; differences in the environment cause the manifestations of\ndifferent elements of these complex behavioral dispositions humans\npossess. For example, the patterns of foraging behavior of the Ache\npeople in the Paraguay rain forest (Hill and Hurtado, 1996) and the\nInuit in the Arctic (Smith, 1991) are very different, and the genetic\ndifferences between these groups are insufficient to explain them.\nHowever, both could be simply local manifestations of a larger and\nmore general foraging strategy (or strategies) which humans possess,\nwhich could be heritable and an adaptation. A behavioral strategy is,\nafter all, simply a complex behavioral disposition, which involves\nresponding in a variety of specific ways to a set of environmental\ncues, most of which would be achieved by having an appropriate\npsychological mechanism or mechanisms underlying the set of\ndispositions. In which case, heritability of a behavioral strategy\nonly depends on there being a psychological mechanism or mechanisms\nthat produces that strategy reliably, and that mechanism\u2019s\nitself being heritable. Of course, whether there are such heritable\nmechanisms for the behavioral strategies in which the HBEs are\ninterested is likely to be a matter of some controversy.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, some philosophers have argued that it is possible\nfor traits to be adaptations in the standard sense even when they are\nnot heritable according to the population genetic\n definition[7].\n Despite the claim above that heritability in the population genetic\nsense is required as a condition of the action of natural selection,\ntechnically all that is required for natural selection to occur on a\ntrait T is for T to be heritable in the weaker sense, i.e. that it be\nrobustly transmitted, such that the trait variant in a parent tends to\nturn up reliably in the offspring. The reason heritability in the\npopulation genetic sense was believed to also be necessary for natural\nselection was that genes were believed to be the only developmental\nresource transmitted to offspring, so only if variation in traits\nfollowed variation in genes would traits be subject to natural\nselection for the reasons described above. However, recently a variety\nof philosophers and scientists have argued (Odling-Smee et al., 2003;\nSterelny, 2003, 2007, 2012) that natural selection can occur on traits\neven if traits vary most with the environment rather than genes,\nso long as environments can themselves be transmitted down\nlineages; Sterelny\u2019s suggestion is that this might be\nachieved by robust niche construction. This has an interesting\nconsequence: if highly reliably transmitted cultural traits could be\nsubject to natural selection, standard evolutionary methods and models\nof the sorts used in behavioral ecology could be used to understand\nthe evolution of such traits.\n\nThis is the not the end of the problem, however. Some philosophers\nhave argued that not all traits that are culturally transmitted or\nlearnt can be properly understood using adaptationist methods, because\nmany of these traits are not heritable even in this weaker sense, and\nhence cannot be adaptations (Driscoll, 2009; Driscoll and Stich, 2008;\nKitcher, 1990). Worse, such traits could appear highly adaptive on\nevolutionary models. For example, traits which are subject to highly\nadaptive individual learning or adaptive social transmission processes\nin populations (Henrich and Boyd, 1998; Henrich and Gil-White, 2001)\nare nevertheless not adaptations because they are not shaped by\nnatural\n selection[8].\n This is because in many of these cases, the features of the\nenvironment that make the trait appear adaptive may not actually have\nfeatured as selection conditions in the causal history of the trait\n(or perhaps as causes in any sense). In such cases, evolutionary\nmethods popular in sociobiology and the current evolutionary social\nsciences (such as optimality modeling) will make traits appear to be\nadaptations to those conditions when they are not. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of dual inheritance theory, gene culture co-evolution and\nthe associated theory, see the entry on\n cultural evolution.\n4.3 Behavioral vs. Psychological Focus\n\nAnother problem for behavioral ecology and sociobiology is their focus\non trying to understand the biological basis of behavior as\nsuch. The behavioral focus made sense to those behavioral ecologists\ninfluenced by Lorenz and Tinbergen\u2019s ethology, but once\ncognitive psychologists became interested in applying evolutionary\nthinking to their work, the effects of the cognitive revolution in\npsychology began to have an effect on some of the\n\u201csociobiological\u201d thinkers, and they transformed\nsociobiology into evolutionary psychology (Cosmides and Tooby, 1987;\nTooby and Cosmides, 1990). The result of the cognitive revolution in\npsychology was that many psychologists came to regard the proper\ntarget of explanation in psychology to be genuinely psychological\nstates or mechanisms rather than behavioral dispositions (as in\nSkinnerian Behaviorism) (Chomsky, 1959). In cognitive science since\nthe middle of the twentieth century, psychological states and\nmechanisms have largely been understood in computational and\nmaterialist terms, that is, that the mind is the brain, and that brain\nstates and mechanisms are essentially computational states and\ncomputers respectively (though almost certainly not serial computers).\nPsychological descriptions, then, are simply descriptions of these\nbrain systems in computational or information-processing terms;\ngenerally they appeal to representations, decision rules and\nalgorithms that brain systems process. The shift in methodology and\ntheory represented by this change in approach was extremely\nsignificant. But it also appears to have made cognitive psychologists\ninterested in evolution averse to thinking of behavioral dispositions\nas proper targets of evolutionary explanation, just as they were\naverse to thinking of them as the proper targets of psychological\nexplanation (Cosmides and Tooby, 1987). This issue never seems to have\narisen for the human behavioral ecologists; indeed, not only is\nbehavior treated as the only proper target of evolutionary\nexplanation, but psychology is explicitly ignored in favor of behavior\nfor methodological reasons\u2014the focus on behavior is part of the\n\u201cphenotypic gambit\u201d (Grafen, 1984) which (as described\nabove) simplifies evolutionary modeling and the process of deriving\nexplanations from it in human behavioral ecology.\n\nThe importance of the issue to the evolutionary psychologists has led\nto a series of arguments traded between the human behavioral\necologists and evolutionary psychologists for preferring behavior over\npsychology and vice versa. Two main arguments have been raised in\nfavor of considering behavior the proper target of explanation, both\nfrom. The first is purely practical: behavior is relatively\nstraightforwardly observable whereas psychological mechanisms are not,\nto the extent that the nature of only a few psychological mechanisms\nhas been uncontroversially demonstrated (one of the few examples might\nbe the mechanisms for learning language) (Alexander, 1990). The second\nis that only behavior can be an adaptation because only behavior is\nthe actual causal nexus between the organism and its environment\n(Alexander, 1990; see the same idea in early form in Skinner,\n1984).\n\nThe central problem with both of these arguments is that, while they\nare true of overt behavior, they are not true of the behavioral\ndispositions or strategies (complex behavioral dispositions) which are\nthe actual targets of explanation in behavioral ecology\u2014or at\nleast, no more true than of psychological mechanisms. Behavioral\ndispositions do not causally interact with the environment except\ninsofar as they lead to the actual manifestation of overt behavior;\nthey are also no more \u201cstraightforwardly observable\u201d than\npsychological mechanisms since they cannot be observed until overt\nbehavior in manifested, and even then distinguishing between different\nstrategies with overlapping component behavioral dispositions is also\ndifficult.\n\nArguments for the claim that only psychological mechanisms should be\nconsidered to be adaptations rest on the idea that behavior is really\nonly ever a manifestation of the underlying psychology. Behavior is\nnot an adaptation so much as it is the effect of an adaptation.\nCosmides and Tooby (1987) also argue that the really interesting\nevolutionary generalizations emerge at the level of psychology, not\nbehavior. Again, however, this argument depends on understanding\n\u201cbehavior\u201d as \u201covert behavior\u201d, individual\nchunks of physical activity that are not necessarily reproduced over\ntime and which do not occur in evolutionary social science\ngeneralizations, verses understanding \u201cbehavior\u201d as\n\u201ccomplex behavioral strategies\u201d, which do seem potentially\ntransmissible (via the psychological mechanisms that support them). It\nis also notable that such strategies are the subject of a significant\nevolutionary literature\u2014such as evolutionary game theory, on\nwhich Cosmides and Tooby themselves depend: the argument for expecting\ntheir famous \u201cCheater Detection\u201d module (Cosmides, 1989;\nCosmides and Tooby, 1992) is derived from Axelrod and Hamilton (1981)\nand Trivers\u2019 (1971) work showing that TIT FOR TAT, which\nrequires its players to be able to detect cheaters on reciprocally\naltruistic interactions, is an evolutionary stable\n strategy[9].\n\nMore recently, philosophers have also presented some arguments for one\nside or the other of this issue. Buller (2005, 50\u201352), for\nexample, argues that behaviors cannot be adaptations because they are\nnot heritable, whereas psychological mechanisms are. However,\nBuller\u2019s discussion does not make the distinction between overt\nbehaviors and behavioral strategies described above. Buller argues\nthat behaviors could disappear from the population for generations if\nthe necessary response conditions never arose, but yet still emerge\nagain if the stimulus reappeared, and this suggests that these\nbehaviors are not inherited as such rather than the underlying\npsychological mechanism. In this he is right as long as he means the\novert behaviors; behavioral dispositions or strategies could also\nremain present and be inherited in the absence of the response\nconditions. Moreover, Buller\u2019s description of a\n\u201cpsychological mechanism\u201d in this context sounds rather\nlike a behavioral disposition (2005, 52\u201353).\n\nAnother argument in the philosophical literature for thinking that\nbehaviors are not the proper targets of natural selection explanations\nis that behaviors are not quasi-independent (Lewontin, 1978)\nin the way they need to be to evolve by selection in their own right\n(Sterelny, 1992; Sterelny and Fitness, 2003; Sterelny and Griffiths,\n1999). This is because many behavioral strategies will depend on\nmulti-purpose mechanisms that cannot change during evolution without\nthose changes ramifying to the other strategies those mechanisms\nproduce. However, Driscoll (2004) argues that this is not necessarily\nthe case; multi-purpose mechanisms, in order to be able to produce\nmore than one strategy, would have to have branching algorithms;\nvariation in any of these mechanisms necessary to generate variation\nin any one strategy need only occur on the branch relevant to the\nstrategy in question and need have little or no effect on the other\nbranches. Instead, whether an evolutionary explanation is properly\ndirected at the behavioral or psychological level depends on the\ncase.\n5. Conclusion\n\nSociobiology, despite its complicated history, remains of interest to\nphilosophers and has some import for certain important philosophical\ndebates. One such question is whether human beings should be\nunderstood to have a nature, a set of traits which for Wilson\nin particular are those heritable traits that have been fixed in the\npopulation by natural selection (Wilson, 1978). Consequently, this\n\u2018nature\u2019 can be discovered and understood using the\nstandard adaptationist methods used in other areas of biology. Most\nimportantly, Wilson suggests that some of the characteristics that\nmake up human nature are specifically behavioral.\n\nQuite apart from the fundamental interest of the question of whether\nthere is a human nature, the issue is important because it might have\na significant moral or social upshot: what society we can have, and\nindeed what society we should have might depend on what human nature\nis like (Wilson, 1978). It was this concern that ignited the\n\u201csociobiology wars\u201d in the early days after the\npublication of Sociobiology. The \u201cSociobiology Study\nGroup\u201d was concerned that Wilson was trying to argue that many\nproblematic or harmful features of current societies, such as\noppressive gender roles, negative race relations and interpersonal\naggression might be unchangeable (Sociobiology Study Group of Science\nfor the People, 1976). Philosophers of biology have strongly resisted\nthe idea that humans have a \u2018nature\u2019 in anything like the\ntraditional sense of a fixed essence (Hull, 1986; Lewens, 2012; Lloyd\nand Crowley, 2002) but there is also some debate about whether humans\ncould be said to have a nature in the sense of a set of evolved traits\nin much the way that Wilson suggests (e.g. see Machery, 2008, 2012;\nfor a critique see Powell, 2012). Philosophers in this area are\ninstead focusing on notions of human nature that take into account the\nflexibility of human development and the capacity of human beings to\nconstruct their own development and hence their own\n\u2018nature\u2019 (Griffiths, 2009; Ramsey, 2013; Stotz, 2012).\n\nAnother hope on the part of philosophers is that understanding the\nevolution of cognition might give us some insight into the nature of\ncertain human psychological traits that have particular philosophical\ninterest. One such trait is our moral psychology. Moral psychology is\nof interest to philosophers who hold naturalistic views of ethics\nbecause they believe moral values depend in part on features of that\npsychology; understanding that psychology and how it evolved would\ngive us insight into what the correct moral values are. Understanding\nthe origins of human moral psychology might also help answer certain\nmetaethical questions (Street, 2006). As Wilson hoped, scientists\nworking in disciplines which are the modern descendants of\nsociobiology have contributed to our understanding of the way that\nnorms, including moral norms, might have become established in human\nevolution (see, for example, Henrich and Boyd, 2001; Sripada, 2005).\nPhilosophers still strongly disagree, however, on how the evolution of\nmoral psychology, especially for the acquisition of norms, should be\nunderstood (Dwyer, 2006; Sripada and Stich, 2006; Sterelny, 2010).\n\nOther debates surrounding sociobiology are still ongoing. For example,\nwhile methodological adaptationism has become and remained the\nstandard approach in behavioral ecology, not all philosophers are\nconvinced that this is an entirely benign practice \u2013 there are\nstill concerns about the assumptions that this methodology requires\n(see, for example, Lewens, 2009; Lloyd, 2005). Similarly, there has\nbeen an increasing interest in the role of culture in the nature and\nhistory of human behavior; work studying the evolution of culture has\nincreased since Lumsden and Wilson (1981) published their book.\nPhilosophers and scientists are still addressing questions about how\nand how far cultural traits can be said to evolve; and, as discussed\nabove, whether traits that have evolved in this way can be considered\nadaptations in any sense (Driscoll, 2011; Fracchia and Lewontin, 1999,\n2005; Henrich et al., 2008; Sperber, 2006; Sterelny, 2006).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alexander, R.
