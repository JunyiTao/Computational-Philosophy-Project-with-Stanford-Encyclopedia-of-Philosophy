    "main_text": "Procreative Autonomy || Feminist perspectives on procreative autonomy\n2.3 Feminist perspectives on procreative autonomy\n\nFeminist perspectives on procreative autonomy are diverse, but they\nshare a commitment to opposing patriarchy and promoting people\u2019s\n(particularly women\u2019s) abilities to determine the shape of their\nown lives, where this includes sexual and reproductive autonomy. While\nsome feminists also take communitarian, repro-libertarian, or more\nnuanced liberal perspectives, other feminists criticize those\napproaches. One general theme of feminist criticism is that mainstream\nprocreative ethics often employs abstractions which obscure the impact\nof policies on women\u2019s bodies, as well as the real-world context\nof socio-economic pressures (e.g., Overall 2012). Much feminist work,\nthen, begins with women\u2019s embodied experience in pregnancy, as\ncaregivers, and as subject to distinct, gendered, social and economic\npressures (e.g., Mullin 2005; Satz 2010; Gheaus 2016b).\n\nThe feminist concern to enable women to control their own lives and\nbodies suggests sympathy with the repro-libertarians\u2019 focus on\nautonomy and equality. But many feminists are skeptical of the\nreproductive biotechnology establishment, which remains preponderantly\nwhite, upper-middle class, male, and corporate. Hence feminists have\ncharged that repro-libertarianism would exacerbate existing power\ninequalities (Corea 1985; Sherwin 1987, 1992; Rothman 1989; Dodds and\nJones 1989a; Baron 2019). While this establishment represents itself\nas empowering women, many feminists charge that it succeeds only in\ndisempowering them: it conscripts poorer women into service for people\nwho are usually wealthier; it creates new expectations that may subtly\ncoerce women to pursue fertility treatments or other medical\ninterventions; and it inevitably reflects the cultural, economic,\nsexist, and racist biases of the society at large (Brazier 1998;\nRoberts 1997).\n\nSome feminists have also raised the concern that any putative right to\nprocreate threatens to give men power over women. In addition to\nempowering the mostly male scientific establishment, a right to\nprocreate could empower a man to prevent his erstwhile partner from\naborting her pregnancy (Overall 1993). Thus the importance of a right\nnot to procreate has led many feminists to place the various strands\nof procreative autonomy within a nexus of interests.\n\nCritiques of the concept of procreative autonomy as misleading or\nempty rhetoric reflect a larger feminist project critical of autonomy\nconstrued as individual choice: within an inegalitarian social and\neconomic system, some feminists argue, pressures on choice will ensure\nthat supposedly free choices disadvantage women (e.g. Dodds and Jones,\n1989a). This is particularly problematic when the medical\nestablishment presents burdensome technologies as the expected norm.\nChoices are shaped by the salient alternatives, so that the widespread\nadoption of new medical technologies will affect women\u2019s choices\n(as the normalization of testing for Downs\u2019 syndrome shapes\nwomen\u2019s choice to undergo such testing). The point is not that\nadopting new technology is always problematic, but that the\nrepro-libertarian framework for evaluating it is na\u00efve and\nmisleading (Sherwin 1992; see also\n 3.5\n below, State Policies). These concerns extend to the way in which\nreproductive policy and technologies shape, and are shaped by, race as\nwell as gender (Roberts 1997; Russell 2018).\n\nA further feminist concern is that the rhetoric surrounding\nreproductive biotechnology commodifies women\u2019s bodies, devalues\nwomen\u2019s role in reproduction, and treats women as mere means\nrather than ends in themselves. For instance, some reproductive\nservices entail so-called \u201cwomb rental,\u201d \u201cegg\nharvesting,\u201d or \u201csurrogate motherhood\u201d (Rothman\n1989; Ber 2000; Anderson 1990; Baron 2019). Feminists such as Corea\nargue that the reproductive biotechnology establishment relies on a\ndistorted and stereotyped picture of the nature, desires, and needs of\nwomen, as well as the success rate of the technologies it purveys, and\nthat these technologies result in physical harms to women (Corea 1985;\nBrazier 1998).\n\nBy conceptualizing women and their fetuses or newborns as having\nconflicting interests, rather than as in symbiotic harmony (as they\nusually are), the medical establishment promotes an adversarial view\nwhich lends itself to overriding pregnant women\u2019s treatment\ndecisions. Such interventions, such as court-ordered C-sections, are\nespecially problematic when similar interventions would not be imposed\non parents to save a born child\u2019s life (such as a court-ordered\nblood transfusion); this inconsistency suggests a bias against\npregnant women\u2019s decision-making capacity. Understandings of\npregnancy and motherhood, feminists argue, need to be enriched by\nconsidering women\u2019s experience of pregnancy and moving away from\nan antagonistic medical model, as well as appreciating how that model\nhas been socially constructed (Purdy 1990; Kukla 2005; Mullin\n2005).\n\nFeminist care ethics, which early on took the mother-child\nrelationship as the model of caring (e.g., Held 1987), has provided a\nrich conceptual resource for feminist procreative ethics. The\ninfluence of care ethics can be seen, for example, in arguments which\nforeground the value of intimate mother-fetus relationships in\nexamining the moral basis of parenthood and the legitimacy of contract\npregnancy (e.g., Gheaus 2016b). In light of the challenge to\ntraditional understandings of parenthood posed by new ARTs, Mary\nLyndon Shanley has argued for caregiving as the ground of moral\nparenthood (Shanley 2018).\n\nFinally, much feminist scholarship has focused on the unequal division\nof labor between parents within the household and its effect on\ngirls\u2019 life chances, and hence on the state\u2019s role in\naddressing this gendered division of parenting labor and defining the\nlegal institution of the family (Okin 1989, Card 1996, Schouten 2019;\nsee also\n 3.5\n below). Feminist perspectives appear throughout the discussion below.\n(See also the entry on\n feminist perspectives on the family.)\n",
