    "main_text": "Normative conceptions of the person || The Analects\n2.1 The Analects\n\nThe Analects (Lun Yu \u8ad6\u8a9e) is the text\ntraditionally taken to be the most reliable reflection of the\nteachings of the historical Kongzi \u5b54\u5b50 (latinized name\n\u201cConfucius\u201d 551\u2013479 BCE; see entry on\n Confucius, \u00a72.1\n for more information on the Analects). Confucius presents\nhimself as transmitting ethical guidance from ancient Sages (see Jiang\n2021). The heart-mind of the junzi \u541b\u5b50\n(exemplary person) and the sheng ren \u8056\u4eba (sage)\nthus play pivotal roles of examples of how to morally cultivate people\nwho can, advise rulers or themselves become rulers.\n\nIn Analects 2.4, Confucius presents a mini autobiography that\nidentifies several stages in his moral cultivation. At age fifteen he\nset his heart-mind on learning (all references to the text in Chinese\nwill be to Analects, CTP, unless otherwise indicated). At\nthirty, he was able to take his stand (his place in society). At forty\nhe had no perplexities (performed role-rituals flawlessly). At fifty\nhe knew the mandate of Tian \u5929 (his nature-assigned\nmission). At sixty, his ears were attuned (spontaneously reacted to\nspoken cues). At seventy, he could follow his heart-mind\u2019s\ndesires without overstepping the boundaries.\n\nThe stages indicate the centrality of learning and practice to the\nheart-mind. Moral cultivation was learning one\u2019s role well. At\nseventy his learning made him an unerring in his second-nature\nresponses to situations with no inclination to immoral behavior. This\nholistic cultivation is inherent in the heart-mind as guiding behavior\naccording to a learned role\u2014which one views as natural for\noneself. Cultivation encompasses the whole person, not just the\nheart-mind, but the qi of the body.\n\nMoral excellence throughout that text is embodied. Book 10 contains\nclose observations of Confucius\u2019 ways of speaking, his physical\nbearing, facial expressions, gestures, and bodily postures as they\nvary over different contexts. In his home village, he looked humble\nand hesitant in his speech, but in the ancestral temple or at court,\nhe spoke articulately but carefully (Analects 10.1). The way\nhe carried himself upon entering the duke\u2019s gate showed his\nreverence for the office (10.4). Upon seeing someone in mourning\ndress, even an intimate associate, he took on a solemn expression, or\nriding past someone in mourning, he would bow to the crossbar of his\ncarriage (10.25).\n\nThe different ways his physical bearing and movements express respect\nand sympathy according to context is related to the way that moral\ncultivation involves dedicated performance of rituals that attach to\none\u2019s roles, such as greeting one\u2019s fellow villagers,\ngetting up to speak at the ancestral temple or at court, and greeting\nthose in mourning. Performing these rituals is a way of training\noneself to have the desired affective and bodily stances toward\nothers. Performance constitutes an individualized expressions of moral\nexcellence. Confucius thus becomes a model from which others may\nlearn. Modeling was key to this learning process. Knowing one\u2019s\nroles is knowing one\u2019s \u201cnames\u201d as they pertain to\nthese roles, and rituals constitute a self-training in how to perform\none\u2019s named role: let the ruler rule, the minister minister, the\nfather father, and the son son (Analects 12.11; see also\n13.3).\n\nThe heart-mind is expected to take the lead in cultivation of the\nentire person: \u201csetting one\u2019s heart-mind on\nlearning\u201d. Its learning is not knowing facts but performing a\nbehavior guided by a model. The student follows examples of moral\nstandards. This eventually lets one to achieve moral excellence,\nshaping one\u2019s desires and emotions so that they do \u201cnot\noverstep the bounds\u201d, and so that the whole person is attuned to\nTian\u2019s calling. Yan Hui (a remarkable student whose\nearly death breaks Confucius\u2019 heart) is praised by Confucius for\nnever repeating the same mistake (Analects 6.3), and for a\nheart-mind that didn\u2019t deviate in its focus on practicing\nren \u4ec1for three months. Others could maintain focus for\nonly days or a month (6.7). In the Analects, ren is\nis this comprehensive moral excellence. Confucius sums it up as loving\nor caring for persons (12.22). Later the Mengzi, would\nidentify ren as the particular virtue often translated as\n\u201cbenevolence\u201d. Here we translate ren as\n\u201chuman-heartedness\u201d. The heart-mind\u2019s aim\n(zhi \u5fd7) on becoming ren is all-important. In\n9.26, Confucius says,\n\n\nThe three armies may be deprived of their commander, but even\ncommoners cannot be deprived of their aim. All commit to their aim as\narmies to protecting their commander.\n\n\nConfucian ethics centers on an ideal of fully-realizing humanity. The\nideal is rooted in family relationships and grows to all social\nrelations. Thus, learning about the heart-mind of others is crucial to\nethical cultivation. When he is asked whether there is a single word\nthat can sum up his guidance, Confucius replies, \u201cIt is\nsympathetic understanding (shu \u6055): what you do not\nwant, do not do to others\u201d (Analects 15.24). This has\nbeen called the \u201cnegative\u201d Golden Rule of Confucianism,\nand 6.30 supplies the positive version when Confucius says that\nren people (\u4ec1\u4eba) wishing to establish themselves\nalso seek to establish others and in wishing to be a model of\nexcellence, helps others achieve excellence. He goes on to say that to\nbe able to draw from what is close as an analogy is called the method\nof ren. The Doctrine of the Mean in the Book of\nRites (Liji \u79ae\u8a18 Zhongyong\n\u4e2d\u5eb8) comments further on what shu might mean\nwhen applied to sympathetically understanding others to whom one\nstands in a role relationship: to serve my father as I would expect my\nson to serve me, to serve my ruler as I would expect my minister to\nserve me, to serve elder brothers as I expect younger brothers to\ntreat me, and to treat my friends as I expect my friends to serve me\n(Liji Zhongyong 13).\n\nShu is a method for achieving shared moral excellence in\ncommunion with social others. One reflects on what is close to guide\none\u2019s aspirations to a life in a human social community.\nOne\u2019s desire for excellence is not transparent but emerges over\na lived life with others. Confucius\u2019s conception of moral\nprogress is sensitive to differences in each life circumstance, from\nformative early social roles to physical characteristics and\ntemperament. One sympathizes with others by identifying both relevant\nsimilarities and differences. Each person\u2019s heart-mind\nis similarly sensitive to their particular capacities and roles in\ntheir lives as they unfold.\n\nIn one conversation, Confucius suggests to his students Zilu and Yan\nHui that they each tell what they would most like to do. Zilu says\nthat he would like to share his horses and carriages, his clothing and\nfurs, with his friends, and if they damage them, to bear them no ill\nwill. Yan Hui says he would like to refrain from bragging about his\nown abilities, and to not exaggerate his own accomplishments. When\nthey ask the Master what he would most like to do, Confucius replies\nthat he would like to bring peace and contentment to the aged, to\nshare relationships of trust and confidence with his friends, and to\nlove and protect the young (Analects 5.26 [1998]).\nZilu\u2019s and Yan Hui\u2019s statement of their aspirations\nreflect their particular preoccupations as individuals.\nConfucius\u2019 statement not only comprehends their aspirations as\nparticular ways of fulfilling his own, but identifies what everyone\nmight ultimately want. The heart-mind, then, is the source of\nattunement not only to the Dao of Tian but to the\nothers with whom one\u2019s relationships go into a fully realized\nsocial life.\n\nThe use of analogy in setting forth a fundamental tenet signals the\ncentrality of this type of reasoning in Confucianism and in Mohism, as\nshall be seen below. Analogy plays an important role in the\nMozi but gets incorporated into a conception of knowledge as\nskillfully and reliably classifying things and distinguishing them\nfrom each other so that one may act rightly and benevolently in the\nworld.\n",
