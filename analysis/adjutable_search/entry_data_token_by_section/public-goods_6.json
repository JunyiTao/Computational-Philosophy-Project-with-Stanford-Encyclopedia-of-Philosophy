    "main_text": "The Economics of Public Goods and the Public-Goods Problem || The Public-Goods Problem\n3.1 The Public-Goods Problem\n\nThe provision of public goods is often associated with market failure\ndue to the externalities created by the public good. Suppose that in a\ntwo-by-two toy economy Bob and Sally decide how much to invest in a\ndiscrete public good G such as a radio station. Both have an\ninitial endowment of a private good (which functions as money in this\neconomy). The public good will be produced \\((G = 1)\\) if the sum of\ncontributions \\(g_{\\textrm{Bob}}\\) plus \\(g_{\\textrm{Sally}}\\) is\nhigher than the production cost c. Thus (Varian 1992: 415):\n\n\\[\nG =  \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\textrm{if } g_{\\textrm{Bob}} + g_{\\textrm{Sally}} \u2265 c\\\\\n0 & \\textrm{if } g_{\\textrm{Bob}} + g_{\\textrm{Sally}} < c. \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nHow much they will contribute will depend on their reservation prices\n\\(r_{\\textrm{Bob}}\\) and \\(r_{\\textrm{Sally}},\\) i.e., on the maximum\namount of the private good each agent is willing to give up for the\npublic good. It is then easy to show that the production of the public\ngood will be a Pareto-improvement if and only if (Varian 1992:\n 416)[2]:\n \n\n\\[\nr_{\\textrm{Bob}} + r_{\\textrm{Sally}}  > c,\n\\]\n\n\nthat is, if the sum of reservation utilities exceeds the cost\nof providing the public good. This is analogous to the efficiency\ncondition for a private good, which is efficiently provided whenever\nan individual\u2019s willingness to pay exceeds the cost of producing\nit. In case of a public good, since consumption is non-rivalrous, it\nis enough when the sum total of all reservation prices exceeds the\nproduction cost.\n\nIn the simple two-by-two case, let us assume that \\(r_{\\textrm{Bob}} =\nr_{\\textrm{Sally}} = 100\\) and that \\(c = 150,\\) so that the\nefficiency condition is satisfied. If either Bob or Sally buy the\npublic good, but not both, they would have to be charged the full\ncost, leading to an outcome of \\(-50.\\) The not-buying individual will\nfree-ride on the other\u2019s contribution and get 100. If both\ncontribute, each receives a benefit \\(100 - 150/2 = 25.\\) If neither\ncontributes, the good will not be produced and both end up with zero.\nThe payoffs are displayed in the matrix in Table 2.\n\n\nTable 2: A Public Goods Game\n\n\n\nSally \n\n\n\nContribute\nDon\u2019t Contribute \n\nBob \nContribute\n(25; 25)\n(\u221250; 100) \n\nDon\u2019t Contribute\n(100; \u221250) \n(0; 0) \n\n\n\nThis payoff structure is identical to a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma and\nillustrates the free-rider problem. Bob prefers the public good to be\nproduced but since he benefits from it whether or not he contributes,\nhis most preferred alternative is that in which Sally pays for its\nproduction and he free rides on her contribution. Sally faces\nidentical payoffs. Therefore, both will choose not to contribute,\nmeaning that the public good will not be produced, even though the\nalternative outcome in which both contribute would be Pareto superior.\nA Pareto-superior outcome is one that makes at least one individual\nbetter off while making no-one worse off. (Contribute; Contribute) is\nPareto-superior to (Don\u2019t contribute; Don\u2019t contribute).\n(Don\u2019t contribute; Don\u2019t contribute) is the equilibrium\nstrategy (in the sense that no player has a reason to deviate from\nplaying it, given the other player\u2019s move) but at the same time\nthere is an outcome both would prefer if it could be reached, namely,\n(Contribute; Contribute).\n\nGiven this structure of benefits as well as rationality and\nself-interest of the members of a group, we can expect that free\nmarkets will undersupply public goods. As individuals have strong\nincentives to free ride and the incentive structure is exactly the\nsame for everyone, everyone tries to free ride and the public good\nwill not be produced in consequence. Let us call the apparent\ninability of the market to provide public goods in a sufficient\nquantity the problem the \u201cpublic-goods problem\u201d.\n",
