    "main_text": "Hypothetico-deductivism || Back to black (ravens)\n2.2 Back to black (ravens)\n\nOne attractive feature of HD-confirmation is that it largely eludes\nthe ravens paradox. As the hypothesis \\(h\\) that all ravens are black\ndoes not entail that some generally sampled object \\(a\\) will be a\nblack raven, the HD view of confirmation is not committed to the\neminently Hempelian implication that \\(e = raven(a) \\wedge black(a)\\)\nconfirms \\(h\\). Likewise, \\(\\neg black(a) \\wedge \\neg raven(a)\\) does\nnot HD-confirm that all non-black objects are non-raven. The\nderivation of the paradox, as presented above, is thus blocked.\n\nIndeed, HD-confirmation yields a substantially different reading of\nNicod\u2019s insight as compared to Hempel\u2019s theory (Okasha\n2011 has an important discussion of this distinction). Here is how it\ngoes. If object \\(a\\) is assumed to have been taken among\nravens\u2014so that, crucially, the auxiliary assumption \\(k =\nraven(a)\\) is made\u2014and \\(a\\) is checked for color and found to\nbe black, then, yes, the latter evidence, \\(black(a)\\), HD-confirms\nthat all ravens are black \\((h)\\) relative to \\(k\\). By the same\ntoken, \\(\\neg black(a)\\) HD-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative to the same\nassumption \\(k = raven(a)\\). And, again, this is as it should be, in\nline with Nicod\u2019s mention of \u201cthe absence of \\(G\\) [here,\nnon-black as evidence] in a case of \\(F\\) [here, raven as an auxiliary\nassumption]\u201d. It is also true that an object that is found\nnot to be a raven HD-confirms \\(h\\), but only\nrelative to \\(k = \\neg black(a)\\), that is, if \\(a\\) is assumed to\nhave been taken among non-black objects to begin with; and this seems\nacceptable too (after all, while sampling from non-black objects, one\nmight have found the counterinstance of a raven, but didn\u2019t).\nUnlike Hempel\u2019s theory, moreover, HD-confirmation does not yield\nthe debatable implication that, by itself (that is, given \\(k =\n\\top\\)), the observation of a non-raven \\(a\\), \\(\\neg raven(a)\\), must\nconfirm \\(h\\).\n\nInterestingly, the introduction of auxiliary hypotheses and\nassumptions shows that the issues surrounding Nicod\u2019s remarks\ncan become surprisingly subtle. Consider the following statements\n(Maher\u2019s 2006 example):\n\n(\\(\\alpha_1\\)) \\(\\forall\nx(white(x) \\rightarrow \\neg black(x))\\)\n\n(\\(\\alpha_2\\)) \n\\(\\exists x(swan(x)) \\rightarrow \\exists y(swan(y) \\wedge black(y))\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\alpha_1\\) simply specifies that no object is both white and black,\nwhile \\(\\alpha_2\\) says that, if there are swans at all, then there\nalso is some black swan. Also posit, again, \\(e = swan(a)\n\\wedge white(a)\\). Under \\(\\alpha_1\\) and \\(\\alpha_2\\), the\nobservation of a white swan clearly disconfirms (indeed,\nrefutes) the hypothesis \\(h\\) that all swans are white. Hempel\u2019s\ntheory (extended) faces difficulties here, because for \\(k =\ndev_{e}(\\alpha_1 \\wedge \\alpha_2)\\) it turns out that \\(e\\wedge k\\) is\ninconsistent. But HD-confirmation gets this case right, thus capturing\nappropriate boundary conditions for Nicod\u2019s generally sensible\nclaims. For, with \\(k = \\alpha_1 \\wedge \\alpha_2\\), one has that\n\\(h\\wedge k\\) is consistent and entails \\(\\neg e\\) (for it entails\nthat no swan exists), so that \\(e\\) HD-disconfirms (refutes) \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\) (see Good 1967 for another famous counterexample to\nNicod\u2019s condition).\n\nHD-confirmation, however, is also known to suffer from distinctive\n\u201cparadoxical\u201d implications. One of the most frustrating is\nsurely the following (see Osherson, Smith, and Shafir 1986, 206, for\nfurther specific problems).\n\nThe irrelevant conjunction paradox. Suppose that \\(e\\)\nconfirms \\(h\\) relative to (possibly empty) \\(k\\). Let statement \\(q\\)\nbe logically consistent with \\(e\\wedge h\\wedge k\\), but otherwise\nentirely irrelevant for all of those conjuncts (perhaps belonging to a\ncompletely separate domain of inquiry). Does \\(e\\) confirm \\(h\\wedge\nq\\) (relative to \\(k\\)) as it does with \\(h\\)? One would want to say\nno, and this implication can be suitably reconstructed in\nHempel\u2019s theory. HD-confirmation, on the contrary, can not draw\nthis distinction: it is easy to show that, on the conditions\nspecified, if the HD clause for confirmation is satisfied for \\(e\\)\nand \\(h\\) (given \\(k\\)), so it is for \\(e\\) and \\(h\\wedge q\\) (given\n\\(k\\)). (This is simply because, if \\(h\\wedge k \\vDash e\\), then\n\\(h\\wedge q\\wedge k \\vDash e\\), too, by the monotonicity of classical\nlogical entailment.)\n\nKuipers (2000, 25) suggested that one can live with the irrelevant\nconjunction problem because, on the conditions specified, \\(e\\) would\nstill not HD-confirm \\(q\\) alone (given \\(k\\)), so that\nHD-confirmation can be \u201clocalized\u201d: \\(h\\) is the only bit\nof the conjunction \\(h\\wedge q\\) that gets any confirmation on its\nown, as it were. Other authors have been reluctant to bite the bullet\nand have engaged in technical refinements of the\n\u201cna\u00efve\u201d HD view. In these proposals, the spread of\nHD-confirmation upon frivolous conjunctions can be blocked at the\nexpense of some additional logical machinery (see Gemes 1993, 1998;\nSchurz 1991, 1994).\n\nFinally, it should be noted that HD-confirmation offers no substantial\nrelief from the blite paradox. On the one hand, \\(e = raven(a) \\wedge\nex_{t\\le T}(a) \\wedge black(a)\\) does not, as such,\nHD-confirm either \\(h = \\forall x(raven(x) \\rightarrow black(x))\\) or\n\\(h^* = \\forall x(raven(x) \\rightarrow blite(x))\\), that is, for empty\n\\(k\\). On the other hand, if object \\(a\\) is assumed to have been\nsampled from ravens before \\(T\\) (that is, given \\(k = raven(a) \\wedge\nex_{t\\le T}(a))\\), then \\(black(a)\\) is entailed by both \u201call\nravens are black\u201d and \u201call ravens are blite\u201d and\ntherefore HD-confirms each of them. So HD-confirmation, too, sanctions\nthe existence of confirmation relations that seem intuitively unsound\n(indeed, indefinitely many of them: as we know, other variations of\n\\(h^*\\) can be conceived at will, like the \u201cblurple\u201d hypothesis).\nOne could insist that HD does handle the blite paradox after all,\nbecause \\(black(a)\\) (given \\(k\\) as above) does not HD-confirms that\na raven will be white if examined after \\(T\\) (Kuipers 2000, 29 ff.).\nUnfortunately (as pointed out by Schurz 2005, 148) \\(black(a)\\) does\nnot HD-confirm that a raven will be black if examined after \\(T\\)\neither (again, given \\(k\\) as above). That\u2019s because, as already\npointed out, HD-confirmation fails the predictive inference condition\n(PIC) in general. So, all in all, HD-confirmation can not tell black\nfrom blite any more than Hempel-confirmation can.\n",
