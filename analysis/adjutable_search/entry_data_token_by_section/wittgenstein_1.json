    "main_text": "The Early Wittgenstein || Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\n2.1 Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\n\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus was first published in German\nin 1921 and then translated\u2014by C.K. Ogden (and F. P.\nRamsey)\u2014and published in English in 1922. It was later\nre-translated by D. F. Pears and B. F. McGuinness. Coming out of\nWittgenstein\u2019s Notes on Logic (1913), \u201cNotes\nDictated to G. E. Moore\u201d (1914), his Notebooks, written\nin 1914\u201316, and further correspondence with Russell, Moore, and\nKeynes, and showing Schopenhauerian and other cultural influences, it\nevolved as a continuation of and reaction to Russell and Frege\u2019s\nconceptions of logic and language. Russell supplied an introduction to\nthe book claiming that it \u201ccertainly deserves \u2026 to be\nconsidered an important event in the philosophical world.\u201d It is\nfascinating to note that Wittgenstein thought little of\nRussell\u2019s introduction, claiming that it was riddled with\nmisunderstandings. Later interpretations have attempted to unearth the\nsurprising tensions between the introduction and the rest of the book\n(or between Russell\u2019s reading of Wittgenstein and\nWittgenstein\u2019s own self-assessment)\u2014usually harping on\nRussell\u2019s appropriation of Wittgenstein for his own agenda.\n\nThe Tractatus\u2019s structure purports to be representative\nof its internal essence. It is constructed around seven basic\npropositions, numbered by the natural numbers 1\u20137, with all\nother paragraphs in the text numbered by decimal expansions so that,\ne.g., paragraph 1.1 is (supposed to be) a further elaboration on\nproposition 1, 1.22 is an elaboration of 1.2, and so on.\n\nThe seven basic propositions are:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOgden translation\nPears/McGuinness translation \n\n1.\nThe world is everything that is the case.\nThe world is all that is the case. \n\n2.\nWhat is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic\nfacts.\nWhat is the case\u2014a fact\u2014is the existence of states\nof affairs. \n\n3.\nThe logical picture of the facts is the thought.\nA logical picture of facts is a thought. \n\n4.\nThe thought is the significant proposition.\nA thought is a proposition with sense. \n\n5.\nPropositions are truth-functions of elementary\npropositions.\nA proposition is a truth-function of elementary\npropositions. \n\n\u00a0\n(An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself.)\n(An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself.)\n\n\n6.\nThe general form of truth-function is \\([\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\xi},\nN(\\bar{\\xi})]\\).\nThe general form of a truth-function is \\([\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\xi},\nN(\\bar{\\xi})]\\). \n\n\u00a0\nThis is the general form of proposition.\nThis is the general form of a proposition. \n\n7.\nWhereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\nWhat we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.\n \n\n\nClearly, the book addresses the central problems of philosophy which\ndeal with the world, thought and language, and presents a\n\u2018solution\u2019 (as Wittgenstein terms it) of these problems\nthat is grounded in logic and in the nature of representation. The\nworld is represented by thought, which is a proposition with sense,\nsince they all\u2014world, thought, and proposition\u2014share the\nsame logical form. Hence, the thought and the proposition can be\npictures of the facts.\n\nStarting with a seeming metaphysics, Wittgenstein sees the world as\nconsisting of facts (1), rather than the traditional, atomistic\nconception of a world made up of objects. Facts are existent states of\naffairs (2) and states of affairs, in turn, are combinations of\nobjects. \u201cObjects are simple\u201d (TLP 2.02) but\nobjects can fit together in various determinate ways. They may have\nvarious properties and may hold diverse relations to one another.\nObjects combine with one another according to their logical, internal\nproperties. That is to say, an object\u2019s internal properties\ndetermine the possibilities of its combination with other objects;\nthis is its logical form. Thus, states of affairs, being comprised of\nobjects in combination, are inherently complex. The states of affairs\nwhich do exist could have been otherwise. This means that states of\naffairs are either actual (existent) or possible. It is the totality\nof states of affairs\u2014actual and possible\u2014that makes up the\nwhole of reality. The world is precisely those states of affairs which\ndo exist.\n\nThe move to thought, and thereafter to language, is perpetrated with\nthe use of Wittgenstein\u2019s famous idea that thoughts, and\npropositions, are pictures\u2014\u201cthe picture is a model of\nreality\u201d (TLP 2.12). Pictures are made up of elements\nthat together constitute the picture. Each element represents an\nobject, and the combination of elements in the picture represents the\ncombination of objects in a state of affairs. The logical structure of\nthe picture, whether in thought or in language, is isomorphic with the\nlogical structure of the state of affairs which it pictures. More\nsubtle is Wittgenstein\u2019s insight that the possibility of this\nstructure being shared by the picture (the thought, the proposition)\nand the state of affairs is the pictorial form. \u201cThat\nis how a picture is attached to reality; it reaches right out to\nit\u201d (TLP 2.1511). This leads to an understanding of\nwhat the picture can picture; but also what it cannot\u2014its own\npictorial form.\n\nWhile \u201cthe logical picture of the facts is the thought\u201d\n(3), in the move to language Wittgenstein continues to investigate the\npossibilities of significance for propositions (4). Logical analysis,\nin the spirit of Frege and Russell, guides the work, with Wittgenstein\nusing logical calculus to carry out the construction of his system.\nExplaining that \u201cOnly the proposition has sense; only in the\ncontext of a proposition has a name meaning\u201d (TLP 3.3),\nhe provides the reader with the two conditions for sensical language.\nFirst, the structure of the proposition must conform to the\nconstraints of logical form, and second, the elements of the\nproposition must have reference (Bedeutung). These conditions\nhave far-reaching implications. The analysis must culminate with a\nname being a primitive symbol for a (simple) object. Moreover, logic\nitself gives us the structure and limits of what can be said at\nall.\n\n\u201cThe general form of a proposition is: This is how things\nstand\u201d (TLP 4.5) and every proposition is either true\nor false. This bi-polarity of propositions enables the composition of\nmore complex propositions from atomic ones by using truth-functional\noperators (5). Wittgenstein supplies, in the Tractatus, a\nvivid presentation of Frege\u2019s logic in the form of what has\nbecome known as \u2018truth-tables.\u2019 This provides the means to\ngo back and analyze all propositions into their atomic parts, since\n\u201cevery statement about complexes can be analyzed into a\nstatement about their constituent parts, and into those propositions\nwhich completely describe the complexes\u201d (TLP 2.0201).\nHe delves even deeper by then providing the general form of a\ntruth-function (6). This form, \\([\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\xi}, N(\\bar{\\xi})]\\),\nmakes use of one formal operation \\((N(\\bar{\\xi}))\\)and one\npropositional variable \\((\\bar{p})\\) to represent Wittgenstein\u2019s\nclaim that any proposition \u201cis the result of successive\napplications\u201d of logical operations to elementary\npropositions.\n\nHaving developed this analysis of world-thought-language, and relying\non the one general form of the proposition, Wittgenstein can now\nassert that all meaningful propositions are of equal value.\nSubsequently, he ends the journey with the admonition concerning what\ncan (or cannot) and what should (or should not) be said (7), leaving\noutside the realm of the sayable propositions of ethics, aesthetics,\nand metaphysics.\n",
