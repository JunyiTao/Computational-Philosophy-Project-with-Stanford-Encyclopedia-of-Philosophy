    "main_text": "The Place of Beneficence in the History of Ethical Theory || Kant\u2019s Theory\n2.3 Kant\u2019s Theory\n\n\nKant rejects the utilitarian model of a supreme principle of\nbeneficence, but he still finds a vital place in the moral life for\nbeneficence. He seeks universally valid principles (or maxims) of duty,\nand beneficence is one such principle. A motive of benevolence based on\nsentiment\u2014highly admired by Hume\u2014is morally unworthy in\nKant\u2019s theory unless the motive behind benevolent action is a motive of\nduty. The motive likewise cannot rest on utilitarian goals.\n\n\nKant argues that everyone has a duty to be beneficent, i.e. to be\nhelpful to others according to one\u2019s means, and without hoping for any\nform of personal gain thereby. Benevolence done from friendly\ninclination he regards as \u201cunlimited\u201d (a term subject to\ndifferent interpretations, but meaning at least \u201chaving no\nboundaries in potential scope\u201d), whereas beneficence from duty\ndoes not place unlimited demands on persons. Nonetheless, the limits of\nduties of beneficence are not clear and precise in Kant. While we are\nobligated to some extent to sacrifice some part of our welfare to\nbenefit others without any expectation of recompense, it is not\npossible in the abstract to fix a definite limit on how far this duty\nextends. We can only say that everyone has a duty to be beneficent,\naccording to that person\u2019s means, and that no one has an unlimited duty\nto do so.\n\n\nKant here anticipates, without developing, what would later become\none of the most difficult areas of the theory of beneficence: How,\nexactly, are we to specify the limits of beneficence as an obligation?\nNeither Kant, Hume, nor Mill has a precise answer to this question.\n",
