    "main_text": "Epistemological Solutions\n3. Epistemological Solutions\n\nAny satisfactory, non-skeptical epistemology of perception is going to\ndeny one or more of the epistemological premises of PEW. But that\ndenial will have to be situated within the context of a larger\nepistemological theory of perceptual belief\u2014or better yet, of\nbelief more generally. There are three broad, not necessarily\nexclusive, approaches to this question:\n\nan evidentialist approach, which holds that\nperceptual beliefs are justified when held on the basis of (or when\nthe agent is in possession of) something that counts as a good\nreason for holding that belief;\nan etiological approach, which holds that\nperceptual beliefs are justified when formed in an appropriate way\n(i.e., when the psychological processes by which the beliefs are\nproduced are the kind that generally conduce to justification);\nand\na world-involving approach, which holds that\nperceptual beliefs are justified when the agent is appropriately\nrelated to the worldly truthmaker for that belief (e.g., the\nperceptual belief that p is justified when the agent\nsees that p).\n\n\nThe first two are normally defended as parts of and continuous with a\nmore general epistemological view, encompassing not just perception\nbut also testimony, introspection, memory, inductive and deductive\ninference, and so on. The world-involving view, on the other hand, is\nformulated specifically to handle perception, though one could imagine\nit being extended to some of these other sources.\n\nAn important difference among these approaches is the way they handle\nperceptual experiences. On nearly any evidentialist view,\nexperiences\u2014construed as internal, nonfactive (i.e.,\nnon-factively-individuated) mental states of the agent\u2014play a\ncentral role in the epistemological story, although not necessarily an\nevidential role; indeed what that role is will differ\nconsiderably for the different evidentialist views. For an etiological\nview, experiences matter if and insofar as they are links in the\ncausal chain by which perceptual beliefs are formed, but they are no\nmore or less important than the other, nonexperiential, links. The\nworld-involving views bring experiences back to a position of\ncentrality, but only with a very different understanding of\nexperiences: not as inner states of an agent but as factive,\nrelational phenomena holding between a perceiving agent and a worldly\nstate of affairs.\n\nThese three are quite general approaches, and there is much room for\ndisagreement within each. Thus there are internalist as well as\nexternalist varieties of each as well as disagreement within each as\nto which of the epistemological premises of PEW is to be rejected.\n",
