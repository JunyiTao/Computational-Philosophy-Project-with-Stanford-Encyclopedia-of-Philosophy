    "main_text": "\n\nSince the 1970s, studies of risk have grown into a major\ninterdisciplinary field of research. Although relatively few\nphilosophers have focused their work on risk, there are important\nconnections between risk studies and several philosophical\nsubdisciplines. This entry summarizes the most well-developed of these\nconnections and introduces some of the major topics in the philosophy\nof risk. It consists of seven sections dealing with the definition of\nrisk and with treatments of risk related to epistemology, the\nphilosophy of science, the philosophy of technology, ethics, decision\ntheory, and the philosophy of economics.\n",
