    "main_text": "The history of the problem\n2. The history of the problem\n\nA history of terminology, though, even when done correctly, tracks the\nwrong items. The same technical terms are often used to express very\ndifferent concepts: just consider the philosophical usage of terms\nlike \u2018substance\u2019, \u2018matter\u2019, or even\n\u2018concept\u2019 itself. Conversely, the same concept is often\nexpressed by different terms, some of which may not be technical at\nall, a situation that is especially likely at the beginning of inquiry\ninto a subject. So if terminology is to be used as evidence, much more\nmust be brought into consideration \u2013 simple word searches will\nnot do.\n\nThe terminology, moreover, holds little interest in its own right. In\norder for a history to be philosophically illuminating, it should\nfocus on the concept of intentionality itself or, better still, the\ndivergent conceptions of intentionality that philosophers have had and\ntheir resulting disagreements. These differences afford us the\ngreatest perspective on our own presuppositions and preoccupations, as\nwell as revealing paths and solutions we might not otherwise have\nconsidered. There is thus no need to settle on a single conception as\nthe concept of intentionality at the outset, which would in\nany case only produce a Whiggish history, of development towards and\ndeviations from some favored, but undoubtedly idiosyncratic view. On\nthe contrary, we should take the opposite approach: substantive\ndisagreements between philosophers are potentially the most\ninstructive philosophically.\n\nA philosophical history would therefore do better to focus on the\nhistory of the problem of intentionality: the difficulty,\nthat is, of providing a philosophically adequate account of the nature\nof intentionality in light of its various peculiarities, whatever\nterms may have been used to express it. Such an approach not only\nallows room for different theories of intentionality, but also\ndivergent conceptions, as well as attempts to dissolve the problem,\neither by dismissing the phenomenon entirely or by denying that there\nis any genuine difficulty involved. A history of intentionality that\ndid not include a Parmenides or a Quine would not be very informative,\nespecially if we are trying to understand the difficulty and what is\nat stake.\n\nThe problem of intentionality is the problem of explaining what it is\nin general for mental states to have content, as well as the\nparticular conditions responsible for specific variations in content.\nThe difficulty of providing such an account lies in explaining why\nmental states often seem to violate familiar entailment patterns\n(whether or not we take such violations to be criterial of\nintentionality). To begin with, the content of many mental states does\nnot correspond with what is in the world: what we imagine may not\nexist, our beliefs may be false, our desires may go unfulfilled. To\nput it more paradoxically, a mental state may be about something, even\nif there isn\u2019t any such thing in the world. This is one of a\nnumber of peculiarities that prove difficult to account for, and which\nare sometimes thought to pose a particular stumbling block for\nnaturalistic approaches to the mind. As Wittgenstein once quipped, you\ncan\u2019t hang a man unless he is there, but you can look for him\neven if he\u2019s not, or even if he does not exist at all\n(Philosophical Investigations 1.133, \u00a7462). There are\nother peculiarities as well, concerning our ability to focus\nselectively on certain aspects of objects, without having others in\nmind. For example, while I cannot greet a person without greeting a\nperson of some particular height, I can think of a person without\nthinking of a person of any particular height. I can also entertain\ndifferent attitudes to the same object at the same time, depending on\nthe aspect under which I consider it. So I might believe that the\nMorning Star is a star but that Venus is not one, despite the fact\nthat Venus is the Morning Star; yet for just the same reason,\nwe cannot land a space probe on the one without thereby landing it on\nthe other. These and other difficulties form a loose family of\nphenomena that give rise to the problem of intentionality. Different\nphilosophers may regard these phenomena differently, perhaps focusing\non some but not others, or even excluding some as not belonging\ntogether with the rest. A philosophical history should be generous\nabout such differences: what is important philosophically is that a\nphilosopher recognizes that some of them pose a difficulty, at least\nprima facie, in accounting for mental states.
