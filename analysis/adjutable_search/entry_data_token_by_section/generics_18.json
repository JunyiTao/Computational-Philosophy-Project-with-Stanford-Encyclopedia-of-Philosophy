    "main_text": "Generics and Psychology || A Bayesian Model of Generics\n4.3 A Bayesian Model of Generics\n\nTessler and Goodman (2019) offer an account of generics that is rooted\nin a Bayesian computational approach to cognition. They model\nacceptance/rejection of a generic as a speaker\u2019s decision to\nproduce an utterance of the generic to a naive listener. The goal of\nthe speaker, on their model, is to produce an utterance that aligns\nthe listener\u2019s beliefs about the prevalence of the property\namong members of the kind (the \u201creferent prevalence\u201d in\ntheir terminology) with the speaker\u2019s beliefs. The\nspeaker\u2019s decision is driven by whether the referent prevalence\nis more likely under the listener\u2019s prior beliefs vs. their\nposterior beliefs after hearing the generic. On their model, generics\nhave a threshold semantics, according to which a generic is true if\nthe referent prevalence exceeds a threshold, however this threshold is\nunspecified and unknown by both speaker and hearer. Bayesian\ncomputational modeling provides a mathematical framework in which such\nuncertainty can be readily handled; specifically, interpretation on\nthe model involves integrating over the possible values of this\nthreshold. A listener\u2019s posterior beliefs are arrived at by\nBayesian updating, such that they are proportional to the product of\nthe listener\u2019s prior beliefs about the distribution of the\nprevalence \\(p\\) of the property in question (i.e., over comparable\nkinds), \\(Pr(p),\\) the probability of possible thresholds \\(\\theta\\),\n\\(Pr(\\theta),\\) and a delta function that is 1 if \\(p \\gt \\theta\\) and\n0 otherwise.\n\nTo put the model in less precise but more intuitive terms, the\ndecision to utter a generic \u201c\\(K\\)s are \\(F\\)\u201d depends on\nbeliefs a naive listener would likely have concerning the distribution\nof the property \\(F\\) over comparable kinds. Consider, for example,\nthe distribution of the property laying eggs over animal\nkinds. For most animal kinds, the proportion that lay eggs is\napproximately zero, but there are some animal kinds for which ~50% of\nmembers lay eggs. Any other proportions of egg-laying are quite\nunusual. This describes the shape of the prevalence prior for\nlaying eggs. Consider, then, an utterance of the generic\n\u201crobins lay eggs\u201d: approximately 50% of robins lay eggs,\nand hearing such a generic will, according to the mathematics of the\nmodel, lead the naive listener to update their prevalence prior in\nsuch a way that most of the probability distribution will be clustered\naround 50% and very little will remain around 0%. Thus, uttering this\ngeneric will lead the listener\u2019s prevalence posterior to be\nbetter aligned with the speaker\u2019s beliefs than their prevalence\nprior, and so the generic is endorsed.\n\nTessler and Goodman\u2019s model does a remarkable job of predicting\nthe degree to which people endorse a given generic with great\nquantitative accuracy, and it extends a growing body of evidence in\ncognitive science that much of human cognition, including early\ncognitive development, involves or approximates to Bayesian inference\n(e.g., for a recent review, see Ullman and Tenenbaum 2020). While\ntheir model predicts that prior beliefs about the distribution of the\nprevalence of the property over comparable kinds mediates all\nendorsement/rejection of generics, they allow that these priors may be\ninfluenced by content-based factors. For example, \u201cmosquitoes\ncarry West Nile virus\u201d is predicted to be accepted with a high\ndegree of confidence by the model because the prevalence prior for\ncarrying West Nile virus is almost entirely bunched up very\nclose to zero, and correspondingly the prevalence posterior upon\nhearing the generic shifts modestly over to low but decidedly non-zero\nvalues. If people have a higher order prior expectation that\nstrikingly dangerous properties are rare, such that the prevalence\npriors for such properties resemble that of carrying West Nile\nvirus, then this would mean that people would be disposed to\naccept generics that predicate such properties, even though the\nreferent prevalence is low.\n",
