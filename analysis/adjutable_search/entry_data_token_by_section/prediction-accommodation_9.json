    "main_text": "The Null Support Thesis || Conditional and Unconditional Confirmation\n6.5 Conditional and Unconditional Confirmation\n\nJohn Worrall has been an important contributor to the predictivism\nliterature from the 1970s until the present time. He was, along with\nElie Zahar, one of the early proponents of the significance of\nheuristic novelty (e.g., Worrall 1978, 1985). In his more recent work\n(cf. his 1989, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2010, 2014; also Scerri & Worrall\n2001) Worrall has laid out a detailed theory of predictivism that,\nwhile sometimes presented in heuristic terms, is \u201cat root a\nlogical theory of confirmation\u201d (2005: 819)\u2014it is thus a\nweak heuristic account that takes use-novelty of evidence to be\nsymptomatic of underlying logical features that establish strong\nconfirmation of theory. \n\nWorrall\u2019s mature account is based on a view of scientific\ntheories that he credits to Duhem\u2014which claims that a scientific\ntheory is naturally thought of as consisting of a core claim together\nwith some set of more specific auxiliary claims. It is commonly the\ncase that the core theory will leave undetermined certain \u2018free\nparameters\u2019 and the auxiliary claims fix values for such\nparameters. To cite an example Worrall often uses, the wave theory of\nlight consists of the core theory that light is a periodic disturbance\ntransmitted though some sort of elastic medium. This core claim by\nitself leaves open various free parameters concerning the wavelengths\nof particular types of monochromatic light. Worrall proposes to\nunderstand the diminished status of evidential support associated with\naccommodation as follows: when evidence e is \u2018used\u2019\nin the construction of a theory, it is typically used to establish the\nvalue of a free parameter in some core theory T. The fixed\nversion will be a specific version \\(T'\\) of T. e serves\nto confirm \\(T'\\), then, only on the condition that there is\nindependent support for T\u2014thus accommodation provides\nonly \u2018conditional confirmation\u2019. Importantly, evidence\ne that is used in this way will by itself typically provide no\nevidence for core theory T. Worrall (2002: 201) offers as an\nillustration the support offered to the wave theory of light\n(W) by the two slit experiment using light from a sodium\narc\u2014the data will consist of various alternating light and dark\n\u2018fringes\u2019. The fringe data can be used to compute the\nwavelength of sodium light\u2014and thus used to generate a more\nspecific version of the wave theory of light \\(W'\\)\u2014one which\nconjoins W with a claim about the wavelength of this particular\nsort of light. But the data offer merely conditional support to\n\\(W'\\)\u2014that is the data support \\(W'\\) only on the condition\nthat there is independent evidence for W. \n\nPredicted evidence for Worrall is thus evidence that is not used to\nfix free parameters. Worrall cites two forms that predictions can\ntake: one is when a particular evidential consequence falls\n\u2018immediately out of the core\u2019, i.e., is a consequence of\nthe core, together with \u2018natural auxiliaries\u2019, and the\nother is when it is a consequence of a specific version of a theory\nwhose free parameters have been fixed using other data. To illustrate\nthe first: retrograde\n motion[11]\n was a natural consequence of the Copernican core (the claim that the\nearth and planets orbit the sun) because observation of the planets\nwas carried out on a moving observatory that periodically passed other\nplanets\u2014however it could only be accommodated by Ptolemaic\nastronomy by proposing and adjusting auxiliary hypotheses that\nsupposed the planet to move on an epicycle (retrograde motion did not\nfollow naturally from the Ptolemaic core idea that the Sun, stars and\nplanets orbit the earth). Thus retrograde motion was predicted by the\nCopernican theory and thus offered unconditional support to that\ntheory, while it offered only conditional confirmation to the\nPtolemaic theory. The second form of prediction is one which follows\nfrom a specific version of a theory but was not used to fix a\nparameter\u2014imagine \\(W'\\) in the preceding paragraph makes a new\nprediction p (say for another experiment, such as the one slit\nexperiment)\u2014p offers unconditional confirmation of \\(W'\\)\n(and W; Worrall 2002: 203).\n\nHowever it is important to understand that Worrall\u2019s repeated\nexpression of his position in terms of the heuristic conception of\nnovelty (particularly after his 1985) does not amount to an\nendorsement of strong heuristic predictivism. Worrall clarifies this\nin his 1989 article that focuses on the evidential significance of the\n\u2018white spot\u2019 confirmation of Fresnel\u2019s version of\nthe wave theory of light. The reason the white spot datum carried such\nimportant weight is not ultimately that it was not used by Fresnel in\nthe construction of the theory but because this datum followed\nnaturally from the core theory that light is a wave. The reason the\nfringe data that was used to compute the wavelength of sodium light\n(cf. above) did not carry such weight is that it is not a consequence\nof this core idea (nor has the wavelength of sodium light been fixed\nby some other data). Thus d is novel for T when\n\u201cthere is a heuristic path to [T] that does not\npresuppose [d\u2019s] existence\u201d (Scerri & Worrall 2001:\n418). As Worrall sometimes puts it, whether d carries\nunconditional confirmation for T does not depend on whether\nd was actually used in constructing T, but whether it\nwas \u2018needed\u2019 to construct T (e.g., 1989:\n149\u2013151). Thus Worrall is actually a proponent of\n\u2018essential use-novelty\u2019 (Alai 2014: 304). For Worrall,\nfacts about heuristic prediction and accommodation serve to track\nunderlying facts about the logical relationship between theory and\nevidence. Thus Worrall is ultimately a proponent of weak (not strong)\nheuristic predictivism. Worrall categorically rejects temporal\npredictivism, arguing that the fact that the white spot was a\ntemporally novel consequence in itself was of no epistemic importance.\n\n\nFor further discussion of Worrall\u2019s theory of predictivism see\nMayo 2010: 155f; Schurz 2014; Votsis 2014; and Douglas & Magnus\n2013: 587\u20138. \n\nScerri and Worrall 2001 contains a detailed rendering of the\nhistorical episode of the scientific community\u2019s assessment of\nMendeleev\u2019s theory of the periodic law\u2014it is argued that\nthis story ultimately vindicates Worrall\u2019s theory of\npredictivism. \n\nFor discussion of Scerri and Worrall see Akeroyd 2003; Barnes 2005b\n(and replies from Worrall 2005 and Scerri 2005); Schindler 2008, 2014;\nBrush 2007; and Sereno 2020. \n",
