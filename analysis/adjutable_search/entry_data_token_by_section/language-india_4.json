    "main_text": "Different views regarding sentence-meaning\n6. Different views regarding sentence-meaning\n\nMost schools of Indian philosophy have an atomistic view of meaning\nand the meaning-bearing linguistic unit. This means that a sentence is\nput together by combining words and words are put together by\ncombining morphemic elements like stems, roots, and affixes. The same\napplies to meaning. The word-meaning may be viewed as a fusion of the\nmeanings of stems, roots, and affixes, and the meaning of a sentence\nmay be viewed as a fusion of the meanings of its constituent words.\nBeyond this generality, different schools have specific proposals. The\ntradition of Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 proposes that the words of a\nsentence already convey contextualized inter-connected meanings\n(anvit\u0101bhidh\u0101na) and that the sentence-meaning is\nnot different from a simple addition of these inherently\ninter-connected word-meanings. On the other hand, the Naiy\u0101yikas\nand the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas propose\nthat words of a sentence taken by themselves convey only\nuncontextualized unconnected meanings, and that these uncontextualized\nword-meanings are subsequently brought into a contextualized\nassociation with each other (abhihit\u0101nvaya). Therefore,\nthe sentence-meaning is different from word-meanings, and is\ncommunicated through the concatenation (sa\u1e43sarga) of\nwords, rather than by the words themselves. This is also the view of\nthe early grammarians like K\u0101ty\u0101yana and\nPata\u00f1jali.\n\nFor the later grammarian-philosopher Bhart\u1e5bhari, however, there\nare no divisions in speech acts and in communicated meanings. He says\nthat only a person ignorant of the real nature of language believes\nthe divisions of sentences into words, stems, roots, and affixes to be\nreal. Such divisions are useful fictions and have an explanatory value\nin grammatical theory, but have no reality in communication. In\nreality, there is no sequence in the cognitions of these different\ncomponents. The sentence-meaning becomes an object or content of a\nsingle instance of a flash of cognition (pratibh\u0101).\n",
