    "main_text": "Strategies for Determining Narrow Content || Subtraction Strategy\n5.2 Subtraction Strategy\n\nThe subtraction strategy (Brown 1992) is an attempt to identify the\nnarrow contents of a subject\u2019s beliefs by considering all of the\ncontents of the subject\u2019s belief and subtracting those that are\nnot narrow. The contents that remain must be narrow. More\nprecisely, if a content of my belief is something I believe, then a\nnarrow content of my belief is something that I believe\nand that is believed by every possible duplicate of me\n(possibly within some restricted class of worlds). I say\n\u201cordinary content\u201d instead of \u201cbroad content\u201d\nhere, since the subtraction strategy presupposes that not all ordinary\ncontents are broad.\n\nTo see why this strategy might be appealing, we can consider an\nanalogy with perception. (A similar analogy with action is also\npossible.) Consider the perceptual state of someone looking at an\napple. We can characterize this state in terms of what the person\nsees, just as we can characterize Oscar\u2019s belief state in terms\nof what he believes. In this case, our subject sees an apple, so one\nway to characterize her perceptual state is as \u201cseeing an\napple,\u201d just as one way to describe Oscar\u2019s belief state\nis as \u201cbelieving that water is wet.\u201d However, we can\neasily construct scenarios in which our perceiver is in exactly the\nsame narrow state, but does not see an apple \u2014 perhaps because\neverything except the apple\u2019s facing surface has been cut away.\nWe can easily find a content of the subject\u2019s perception that is\na content of the very same perceptual state but which characterizes it\nmore narrowly: the subject sees the facing surface of the apple, and\nit is by virtue of seeing the facing surface that she sees the apple\nas a whole. Characterizing the perceptual state as \u201cseeing the\nfacing surface of an apple\u201d is a narrower characterization in a\nvery simple sense: if we consider alternative situations in which the\nsubject is intrinsically exactly the same, but her environment is\ndifferent, we will observe that in every situation in which she sees\nan apple, she also sees its facing surface, but that there are\nadditional situations in which she sees the facing surface but does\nnot thereby see an entire apple. Similarly, if we consider\nOscar\u2019s belief that water is wet, we notice that a Twin\nEarth-like scenario provides a situation in which he is in the very\nsame cognitive state but does not believe that water is wet. So we\nlook for other contents of his belief, other things he believes, that\ncharacterize his state more narrowly. In this case we notice that in\nevery situation in which he is in exactly the same intrinsic state and\nbelieves that water is wet, he also believes that the colorless,\nodorless liquid called \u2018water\u2019 is wet, but not conversely.\nSo this latter belief seems to characterize his intrinsic state more\nnarrowly than does the content \u201cwater is wet.\u201d\n\nIt is important to notice that neither the perceptual content of\nseeing the facing surface of an apple, nor the belief content of\nbelieving that the colorless, odorless liquid called\n\u2018water\u2019 is wet, is completely narrow. We can find still\nmore remote possibilities in which the subject\u2019s perceptual or\nbelief state is exactly the same, but he or she does not have this\nperceptual or belief content. (The \u201capple\u201d could be a wax\nimitation or a holographic projection; Oscar\u2019s Twin could live\nin an environment in which the word \u2018liquid\u2019 refers to\nvery finely granulated solids.) To find truly narrow contents we will\nneed to press our subtraction strategy still further, and appeal to\nobjects that are very different from the ordinary objects of\nperception or belief \u2014 perhaps colored shapes or sense-data in\nthe case of perception; perhaps beliefs about the subject\u2019s\nperceptual inputs and behavioral outputs in the case of belief (cf.\nMcDermott 1986).\n\nThis suggests an important point which is rarely mentioned (but see\nRecanati 1994 for a related observation). Narrowness need not be\nconstrued as an all-or-nothing property. We can understand it instead\nas a matter of degree: one content of a mental state is narrower than\nanother the further away from the actual world we need to go in\nlogical space in order to find a world in which the subject\u2019s\nintrinsic properties are the same but the state does not have that\ncontent. (Alternatively, we could relativize the notion of narrow\ncontent to a set of possibilities; the more possibilities the set\nincludes, the fewer contents will count as narrow. For many purposes\nwe never consider Twin-Earth possibilities; for such purposes the\nproposition that water is wet may count as a narrow content of a\nsubject\u2019s belief.) On this way of thinking of things, narrowness\nas it is usually defined is a limiting case: narrowness relative to\nthe set of all metaphysically possible worlds. The concept of\nnarrowness may be useful even if the limiting case never occurs, just\nas the concept of flatness is useful even though in this world the\nlimiting case of absolute flatness never occurs.\n\nPossible problems for the subtraction strategy include the following.\n(1) The strategy presupposes that all the narrow contents of our\nbeliefs are included in the ordinary contents of belief, so that once\nwe have subtracted the non-narrow contents away the narrow contents\nwill remain. On many conceptions of narrow content, however, narrow\ncontent is a more specialized and technical notion than this, and we\ncannot suppose that the ordinary contents of belief will include\nnarrow contents. (2) The conception of narrow content with which the\nsubtraction strategy fits most naturally is the descriptive content\nconception discussed in section 2.1. It inherits the principal\nobjection to that view, namely that it is not clear that ordinary\nlanguage can offer a narrow vocabulary sufficient to describe the\nnarrow contents of our thoughts. Two points should be made in response\nto this worry. First, while the subtraction strategy assumes that the\nnarrow contents of belief are a subset of the ordinary contents of\nbelief, it need not be committed to the view that all of these\nordinary contents are describable in natural language. Second, as\nnoted above, we can think of completely narrow content as a limiting\nideal case. The subtraction strategy offers a way of relating broad\nbeliefs to the narrower beliefs on which they depend. This may be\nuseful even if the process does not terminate in beliefs which are\nabsolutely narrow. (3) Although the subtraction strategy offers a way\nof determining one\u2019s total narrow content, it is not clear\nwhether or how it could be applied to more specific belief states. (4)\nThe subtraction strategy also shares with the diagonalization strategy\nthe problem that it gives us a method of identifying narrow contents\nonly if we already have an independent method of identifying contents\nin general.\n",
