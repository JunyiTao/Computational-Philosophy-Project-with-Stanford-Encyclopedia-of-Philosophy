Mill\u2019s Psychologism\n\nCritics and interpreters of Mill\u2019s philosophy of logic have been\nunable to reach a verdict on the question whether Mill was a\npsychologistic thinker. Recent work by David Godden (2005) provides a\ndetailed explanation for this lack of agreement: Mill\u2019s position\non the relationship between (deductive) logic and psychology is\n\u201cfractured\u201d. Some elements in Mill\u2019s thought push\nhim towards a strongly psychologistic viewpoint, other elements pull\nhim away from it. In other words, sometimes Mill insists that logic\ndepends on psychology, sometimes he denies such dependence. (This\nsection is based on Godden\u2019s important re-assessment.)\n\nAs Mill declares as the beginning of his System of Logic,\nlogic has two parts: the \u2018science of reasoning, as well as an\nart, founded on that science\u2019 (1843, 4). The art of reasoning is\nprescriptive; it provides us with the rules according to which we\nought to reason. The science of reasoning is a descriptive-explanatory\npsychological discipline and analyses mental processes. The overall\ngoal of logic is \u2018the guidance of one\u2019s own\nthoughts\u2019 (1843, 6). The crucial question here is of course how\nthe dependence of the art of reasoning upon the psychological science\nis to be understood. The mere fact that the art is prescriptive does\nnot yet make it independent of psychology.\n\nAt this point it is important to note that Mill\u2019s science of\nreasoning really is, in both subject matter and methodology, a\npsychological discipline. Although the subject matter of the science\nof reasoning is more specific than that of psychology in general\n\u2014 the former investigates \u2018the operations of the human\nunderstanding in the pursuit of truth\u2019 (1843, 6) \u2014 there\nare, as Mill sees it, no special psychological laws characteristic\nexclusively of the domain of the science of reasoning. Instead,\n\u2018the general laws of association prevail among these more\nintricate states of mind\u2019 (1843, 856). Moreover, in both the\ngeneral and the more specific domain, the discovery of laws is due to\n\u2018the ordinary methods of experimental inquiry\u2019 (1843,\n853).\n\nMill offers at least three different accounts of the contribution\nwhich the psychological science of reasoning makes to the art of\nreasoning. On the first account, the prescriptive art of reasoning\nseems prima facie independent of psychological science. In\nthis vein Mill writes, for example, that psychology can only offer\n\u2018the analysis of the mental process which takes place whenever\nwe reason\u2019, whereas the art of reasoning must provide \u2018the\nrules \u2026 for conducting the [reasoning] process correctly\u2019\n(1843, 4). A second account is based on the idea that any successful\nprescription for a given type of thought process must be based on a\nproper and detailed psychological understanding of that process:\n\u2018A right understanding of the mental process itself \u2026 is\nthe only basis on which a system of rules, fitted for the direction of\nthe process, can possibly be founded\u2019 (ibid.). And\nMill\u2019s third account goes further still: \u2018Its [the Science\nof Logic\u2019s] theoretic grounds are wholly borrowed from\nPsychology, and include as much of that science as is required to\njustify the rules of the art\u2019 (1865, 359). On the third account,\npsychology is essential to the justification of the rules of\nreasoning. Mill provides no clear indications on how these prima\nfacie conflicting statements can be reconciled. Clearly the third\nstatement will qualifies as psychologistic by everybody\u2019s\ncriteria \u2014 though doubts have been raised whether, \u2018when\nthis passage is read in its full dialectical context\u2019, it\namounts to more than the claim that \u2018the logician must formulate\nrules of inquiry in a manner which will be as helpful as possible to\ninquirers, and must draw on the psychology of thought to do so\u2019\n(Skorupski 1989, 166). But even the first two accounts, interpreted\nagainst the backdrop of Mill\u2019s other views, make prescriptive\nlogic dependent upon psychology. Logic cannot begin its task until\npsychology has provided a descriptive analysis of reasoning\nprocesses.\n\nWe encounter a similar mixture of psychologistic and\nanti-psychologistic motifs also as we turn to Mill\u2019s views on\nhow the logician ought to justify logical precepts and principles. For\nMill, we specify the rules of deductive inference by identifying the\nvalid forms of the syllogism (1843, 168). And validity is explained by\nthe formula \u2018if the premises are true, the conclusion must\ninevitably be so\u2019 (1843, 166). \u2018Good inferences\u2019\nhave an connection to truth: \u2018A reasoning, to be rightly framed,\nmust conduct to a true conclusion\u2019 (1865, 365). And hence\n\n\u2026 at bottom the only important quality of a thought being its\ntruth, the laws or precepts provided for the guidance of thought must\nsurely have for their principal purpose that the products of thinking\nshall be true (1865, 365).\n\n\nA \u2018good\u2019 inference is thus a \u2018true inference\u2019,\nan inference \u2018grounded in the reality of things\u2019 (1843,\n10\u201311).\n\nIn line with this consideration, Mill distinguishes between\nact, content and object of a judgement. The\ncontent of a judgement accounts for its representational connection to\nthe external world. And the truth of a judgement depends on its\nobject, that is, the state of affairs represented by the content. Thus\nwhen it comes to identifying valid inferences, logic must focus on\nobjects (1843, 87). Mill\u2019s theory of judgements and their truth\ninvolves a rejection of \u2018conceptualism\u2019, the view that the\nobjects of judgements are mental, and that \u2018a proposition is the\nexpression of a relation between two ideas\u2019 (1843, 109). Against\nthis view Mill insists that \u2018propositions \u2026 are not\nassertions respecting our ideas of things, but assertions respecting\nthe things themselves\u2019 (1843, 88).\n\nIt is easy to understand why some authors have taken such statements\nas evidence that Mill was defending an anti-psychologistic position of\nsorts. And yet, we must remember that these statements directly\ncontradict other of his pronouncements, some of which were quoted\nearlier. Recall only that Mills defines logic as \u2018the science of\nthe operations of the human understanding in the pursuit of\ntruth\u2019 (1843, 6). There is no denying that Mill\u2019s theory\nof logic contains incompatible views.\n\nGodden (2005) shows convincingly that even Mill\u2019s object-focused\nproject eventually circles back towards psychologism. First of all,\nMill offers affirmative and negative formulations of the Principle of\nthe Transitivity of Co-existence as the ultimate foundation of all\nsyllogistic reasoning:\n\nThe first, which is the principle of affirmative syllogism, is, that\nthings which co-exist with the same thing, co-exist with one another\n\u2026 The second is the principle of negative syllogisms, and is to\nthis effect: that a thing which co-exists with another thing, with\nwhich other a third thing does not co-exist, is not co-existent with\nthat third thing (1843, 178).\n\n\nSecond, although Mill never seeks in turn to provide a justification\nfor the Principle of Transitivity of Co-existence, it is not difficult\nto work out what for him such justification would have to look like.\nThe parallel case of geometric axioms is clear enough: \u2018It\nremains to inquire, what is the ground for belief in axioms \u2014\nwhat is the evidence on which they rest? I answer, they are\nexperimental truths; generalisations from observation\u2019 (1843,\n231). For Mill all general propositions must ultimately be justified\nby experience:\n\nAnd so, in all cases, the general propositions, whether called\ndefinitions, axioms or laws of nature, which we lay down at the\nbeginning of our reasonings, are merely abridged statements, in a kind\nof shorthand, of the particular facts, which, as occasion arises, we\neither think we may proceed on as proved, or intend to assume (1843,\n192).\n\n\nThird, Mill reverts to a full-blown form of psychologism when turning\nto the justification of other logical principles, in particular the\nPrinciple of Non-Contradiction. Mill insists that it too is an\nempirical generalisation over our experience, and especially over our\ninner experience:\n\nI consider it to be, like other axioms, one of the first and most\nfamiliar generalizations from experience. The original foundation of\nit I take to be, that Belief and Disbelief are two different mental\nstates, excluding one another (1843, 277).\n\n\nHere again the foundations of logical truths cannot be understood and\nexplained independently of psychology. Mill offers a similar analysis\nof the Principle of the Excluded Middle (1843, 278\u20139).\n\nFourth, what pushes Mill back into a psychologistic position is his\nphenomenalism. In his argument with Hamilton, Mill maintains that the\nfundamental logical principles apply not to things in themselves, but\nonly to the objects of our experience. The laws of logic are\n\u2018laws of all Ph\u00e6nomena\u2019 (1865, 381\u20132).\nAccordingly, the fundamental principles of logic \u2014 the\nPrinciples of Non-Contradiction, the Excluded Middle and Identity,\n\n\nare laws of our thoughts now, and invincibly so. \u2026 Any\nassertion, therefore, which conflicts with one of these laws \u2026\nis to us unbelievable. The belief in such a proposition is, in the\npresent constitution of nature, impossible as a mental fact. (1865,\n380\u20131).\n\n\nAnd with this claim Mill\u2019s position is once more back in the\npsychologistic camp.\n",
