    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nTo date, a much larger literature exists under the rubric of feminist\ntheology than of feminist philosophy of religion. Four main reasons\nhave been suggested for this (Frankenberry & Thie 1994: 2\u20134). First, from the\nseventeenth to the nineteenth century, the perspective of white\nEuropean males dominated the formative period of philosophy of\nreligion to such an extent that it was hard to see how the distortions\nof this long tradition might be overcome. Second, in the twentieth\ncentury, once philosophy of religion was professionalized and\ngerrymandered within Philosophy faculties at universities, it was\ninsulated both from the old Theology faculties and the new Religious\nStudies faculties created in the 1960s and 1970s; therefore, feminists\ninterested in pursuing a Ph.D. had to choose between Philosophy (where\nphilosophy of religion was not regarded as \u201creal\u201d\nphilosophy during the ascendancy of the analytic movement) or\nReligious Studies/Theology which took philosophical concerns seriously\nand thus provided a more welcoming location for feminist theorizing on\nreligion. Third, many feminist philosophers themselves have harbored\neither a suspicion of religion or an impoverished understanding of it,\nand so have been slow to develop a significant body of scholarship in\nthis area. Fourth, the entrenched bias and resistance to feminism\nwithin mainstream analytic philosophy of religion, combined with the\nmyth that its methods, norms, and content are gender-neutral, has\nimpeded recognition of the relevance of work appearing under the\nrubric of feminist philosophy of religion. Feminist theology, on the\nother hand, flourishes in an academic field that for over forty years\nhas been hospitable to a variety of liberation theologies,\ndeath-of-god theologies, environmental theologies, postcolonialist\ntheologies, and queer\n studies.[1]\n\n\nThe maturing of feminist philosophy of religion as a field distinct\nfrom feminist theology was evident at the end of the twentieth\ncentury. It could be seen in the appearance of two book-length\nstudies: Pamela Anderson\u2019s A Feminist Philosophy of Religion: The\nRationality and Myths of Religious Belief (1998), and Grace\nJantzen\u2019s Becoming Divine: Towards a Feminist Philosophy of\nReligion (1999). Another measure of the vitality of this field\nwas the publication of such collections as Feminist\nInterpretations of Mary Daly (Hoagland & Frye 2000), devoted\nto an assessment of one of the most original authors in the field, and\nFeminist Interpretations of Soren Kierkegaard (Leon &\nWalsh 1997), containing critical analyses by feminist philosophers of\nthe \u201cfather of religious existentialism\u201d. In addition,\nVolume 1 of Kluwer\u2019s Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of\nReligion (Long 2000), a major reference work covering\n1900\u20132000, concluded with a chapter on feminist philosophy of\nreligion as represented by Mary Daly, Sally McFague, Luce Irigaray,\nJulia Kristeva, Pamela Anderson, and Grace Jantzen. Finally, an\nanthology on Feminist Philosophy of Religion: Critical\nReadings (Anderson & Clack 2004) exhibited the methodological\nrange of the field in terms of psychoanalytic, poststructuralist,\npostmetaphysical, and epistemological frameworks, and provided\nspecialized treatments of such topics as divinity, embodiment,\nautonomy and spirituality, and religious practice.\n\nIn the second decade of the twenty-first century, fresh collections\nare appearing more frequently as essays by feminists bearing on the\nphilosophy of religion become available (see Anderson 2010; Alcoff\n& Caputo 2011).\n",
