In a passage from an unpublished review composed toward\nthe end of his life, Reid writes:\n\nThere are many important branches of human knowledge, to which Sir\nIsaac Newton\u2019s rules of Philosophizing have no relation, and to\nwhich they can with no propriety be applied. Such are Morals,\nJurisprudence, Natural Theology, and the abstract Sciences of\nMathematicks and Metaphysicks; because in none of those Sciences do we\ninvestigate the physical laws of Nature. There is therefore no reason\nto regret that these branches of knowledge have been pursued without\nregard to them. (AC, 186)\n\n\nIn this passage, Reid tells us that Newton\u2019s rules pertain only\nto the physical laws of nature and what is subsumable under them. But\nthe rational principles of action, we have seen, are not themselves\nthe physical laws of nature. They do not concern how the universe in\nfact operates. Rather, they concern how rational agents ought to\nconduct their behavior. Nor are these principles subsumable under\nNewton\u2019s laws (EAP IV.ix: 251). They are, in Reid\u2019s view,\nnot part of the space/time manifold. It follows that Newton\u2019s\nmethods should not guide our theorizing about the rational principles\nof action. Since moral principles are among the rational principles of\naction, it follows that they are not identical with or subsumable\nunder Newton\u2019s laws. Given the additional assumption that\nnatural science must conform to Newton\u2019s rules, Reid concludes\nthat morality is not the subject matter of natural science. That this\nis so, Reid continues, is \u201cno reason to regret.\u201d It is a\nmatter of simply acknowledging the implications of Newton\u2019s\nsystem\u2014implications, Reid maintains, that philosophers such as\nHume and Priestley, who also took themselves to be followers of\nNewton, had failed to appreciate.\n\nIn sum: Suppose we understand moral naturalism to be the view that\nmoral facts are natural. And suppose we say, in a rough and ready way,\nthat a fact is natural just in case it pulls its explanatory weight in\nthe natural sciences (see Wiggins 1993). Reid maintains that Newtonian\nmethods exhaust the limits of natural science. Newtonian science,\nhowever, does not investigate the ends or rational principles for\nwhich we act. The ends for which we act neither fall under Newtonian\nlaws nor are identical with them. But moral facts, Reid says, are\namong the ends or rational principles for which we act. It follows\nthat, in Reid\u2019s view, moral facts are not the proper object of\nscientific inquiry. The moral domain is autonomous.\n",
