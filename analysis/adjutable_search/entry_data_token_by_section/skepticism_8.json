    "main_text": "Pyrrhonian Skepticism || Rejecting Premise 5: Infinitism\n5.2 Rejecting Premise 5: Infinitism\n\nInfinitism, the claim that infinite evidential chains can provide\njustification to their members, is the answer to Agrippa\u2019s\ntrilemma that has received the least attention in the literature. This\nis due, at least in part, to the fact that infinitism has to deal with\nwhat might seem like formidable obstacles. For instance, it seems that\nno one actually has an infinite number of beliefs. To this objection,\nthe infinitist is likely to reply that actually occurring beliefs are\nnot needed, only implicit beliefs that are available to the subject in\norder to continue constructing his inferential chain if called upon to\ndo so (by others or by himself). The plausibility of this reply\ndepends on whether good sense can be made of the notion of implicit\nbelief and the notion of an implicit belief\u2019s being available\nfor a subject. A second apparently formidable problem for infinitism\nhas to do with the fact that the mere appeal to a new belief,\nregardless of its epistemic status, cannot provide justification to\nthe belief we started out with. In other words, infinitism seems to\nrun afoul of the following principle:\n\n\nPrinciple of inferential justification: If S\nis justified in believing p on the basis of S\u2019s\nbelief that q, then S is justified in believing\nq.\n\n\nThe infinitist might reply that he does not run afoul of that\nprinciple, because the beliefs adduced in support of the initial\nbeliefs are themselves justified by beliefs further down the chain.\nBut what goes for the initial set of beliefs goes, it seems, for\nlonger chains. If the appeal to a single unjustified belief cannot do\nany justificatory work of its own, why would appealing to a large\nnumber of unjustified beliefs do any better? Even leaving that problem\naside, the infinitist, like the coherentist, maintains that\njustification can arise merely in virtue of relations among beliefs.\nInfinitists will then have to respond to many of the same objections\nthat are leveled against coherentism\u2014in particular, they would\nhave to respond to the isolation objection mentioned in the next\nsection. (See Aikin 2011 and Klein 1999, 2007 for defenses of\ninfinitism; and see Turri & Klein 2014; Aikin & Peijnenburg\n2014; and Peijnenburg & Wenmackers 2014 for collections of essays\nwhich defend or criticize various forms of infinitism.)\n",
