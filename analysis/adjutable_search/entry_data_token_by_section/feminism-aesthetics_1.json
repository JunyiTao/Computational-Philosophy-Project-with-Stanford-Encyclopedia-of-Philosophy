    "main_text": "Creativity and Genius\n2. Creativity and Genius\n\nWhile genius is a rare gift, according to most theorists the pool of\nhuman beings from which genius emerges includes only men. Rousseau,\nKant, and Schopenhauer all declared that women possess characters and\nmentalities too weak to produce genius. This judgment represents a\nparticular instance of more general theories that attribute to males\nthe strongest and most important qualities of mind, in comparison to\nwhich females are but paler counterparts. At least since Aristotle,\nrationality and strong intellect have been regarded as\n\u201cmasculine\u201d traits that women possess in lesser degrees\nthan men. Women are standardly considered less intellectual but more\nsensitive and emotional. According to some theories of creativity,\nemotionality and sensitivity can be inspirational virtues, and so the\nfield of aesthetics has been more responsive to the positive uses to\nwhich these traits might be put than are some other areas of\nphilosophy. When it comes to genius, however, male artists get the\nbest of both worlds: the great artistic genius is more than\nintellectually brilliant; he is also emotionally sensitive and\nfine-tuned, thus possessing characteristics that are traditionally\nlabeled both \u201cmasculine\u201d and \u201cfeminine.\u201d\n\nChristine Battersby has detailed the long and complicated history of\nthe concept of genius, which has roots in antiquity (Battersby 1989).\nBy the time it reaches its powerful Romantic form in the eighteenth\nand nineteenth centuries, it is especially exclusionary of women\nartists. The artistic genius was praised not only for the strong\nmentality that has always been attributed more heavily to men than to\nwomen, but also for a sensitivity and creativity that partakes equally\nof supposedly feminine attributes. Especially in the nineteenth\ncentury, such \u201cnonrational\u201d sources of inspiration were\nextolled for transcending the rules of reason and bringing something\nnew into being. Womanly metaphors of conception, gestation, labor, and\nbirth were liberally appropriated in descriptions of artistic\ncreativity, at the same time that actual women artists were passed\nover as representatives of the highest aesthetic production.\n\nAs the nineteenth century drew on \u2026 the metaphors of male\nmotherhood became commonplace\u2014as did those of male midwifery.\nThe artist conceived, was pregnant, laboured (in sweat and pain), was\ndelivered, and (in an uncontrolled ecstasy of\nagonized\u2014male\u2014control) brought forth. These were the\nimages of \u2018natural\u2019 childbirth that the male creators\nelaborated. (Battersby 1989: 73).\n\n\nThe description of genius with feminine images did not serve to bridge\nthe gulf between male and female artists, partly because of the\ndifferent ways that their creativity was conceived. Actual childbirth\nwas regarded as an outgrowth of women\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d\nbiological role; their own particular emotions and sensitivities were\nsimilarly regarded as manifestations of what nature bestowed upon\nthem. Their artistic expression was thereby categorized less as\nachievement than as natural display; consequently the expression of\nfeeling in women\u2019s art was often seen as a manifestation of\ntemperament, while strong feelings expressed in the work of men were\ninterpreted as emotions conveyed with mastery and control. By this way\nof thinking, emotions in women\u2019s art are a byproduct of nature;\nin contrast, the genius of the male artist produces a new creation\nthat transcends the dictates of nature (Korsmeyer 2004: ch.3).\n\nWhile by and large disparate evaluations of the capabilities and\nsocial roles of men and women have inhibited women\u2019s historical\naccomplishments in the fine arts, they have not prevented them\nentirely. Art and music historians have reevaluated the record of fine\nart and brought a number of women practitioners to the attention of\nboth scholars and general audiences. While there have been relatively\nfew women artists recognized as \u201cgreat,\u201d they have not\nbeen altogether absent from the historical record. What is more, there\nare certain art forms in which women were the pioneers, such as the\nprose novel. The novel is a relatively new art form in the west, and\nit began as popular story-writing whose market demand also afforded\nopportunities for women writers to earn money. Their works were not\nalways highly praised, for there was a lot of critical disdain for the\nwide appeal of their stories. Some of them, however, such as George\nEliot and Charlotte Bront\u00eb, created works of lasting acclaim and\neven earned that contested accolade, \u201cgenius.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a general skepticism about the soundness of the\ncanon of great arts of the past has informed a good deal of feminist\nscholarship in the critical disciplines, which has reassessed the\nhistorical record in painting, music, sculpture, and literature and\nrevised the canon to include neglected works by women. Rediscovery of\nthe work of women of the past was one of the major efforts of feminist\nscholars during so-called second-wave feminism of the 1970s and 80s, a\nperiod that also saw the founding of women\u2019s studies programs at\nmany colleges and universities in North America and Europe. Especially\nin the early years of such studies, an important goal of scholarship\nwas to give women a fair shot at recognition in order to attain the\ngoal of sexual equality in the arts. As we shall see shortly, this\nproved to be an initial stage in the development of work in feminist\naesthetics.\n\nThere has been considerable debate among feminist scholars concerning\nhow to assess the values associated with genius and artistic\naccomplishment. Some have argued that the idea of genius itself is\nsuspect because of the great disparities in education available to\npeople, and the concept ought simply to be discarded. In addition,\nvalorizing the accomplishments of one individual perpetuates the\nneglect of joint and communal creativity in favor of a kind of\nmasculine heroism. (In fact, earlier feminist art was often\ncollaborative, an explicit rejection of the idea of individual\ncreativity in favor of joint efforts among women.) Other feminists\ndisagree and have located alternative criteria at work in\nwomen\u2019s achievements, arguing that one can discern traditions of\nfemale genius at work in the body of art produced by women (Battersby\n1989).\n\nCritical attention to the values surrounding genius and the\nvalorization of individual creativity has occasioned some practical\nrecommendations regarding museum displays and the sorts of objects\nconsidered worthy of public attention. In fact, recent years have seen\nincreased attention to works produced outside the academic fine art\nsystems, including the creative products of under-represented social\nminorities. Hilde Hein pursues this point by suggesting that museums\nmight divert traditional interest in \u201cmasterworks\u201d and aim\nat understanding more commonplace objects and their meanings, thus\ninverting the usual hierarchy of values manifest in museum and gallery\ndisplays (Hein 2010). Hein maintains that the nonhierarchical values\npromoted by feminist theory might motivate museums to reconsider their\nvisitors and the objects on display, reducing the distance between\nviewer and object that the concept of the masterwork of genius induces\n(Hein 2011, 2014). Sue Spaid goes even further, advancing a relational\ncollaboration among curators, artists, and viewing public (Spaid 2020;\nalso Reilly 2018).\n\nThe debate over creativity is a particular entry into broader\ndiscussions over whether women\u2019s art might represent a kind of\n\u201cgynocentric\u201d tradition different from the androcentric\ntraditions of male artists (Ecker 1986; Hein and Korsmeyer 1993, sect.\nII). If this is to mean that the works of women artists always\nmanifest certain feminine aesthetic qualities due to their\nmakers\u2019 gender, then many feminists respond negatively, arguing\nthat other social positions (historical, national, ethnic, racial,\nsexual orientation, and so forth) impose too many differences on women\nto yield any feminine common denominator to their work (Felski 1989,\n1998). On the other hand, some scholars argue that women artists and\nwriters often produce a counter-voice within their ambient traditions\nwhich might be considered to claim its own \u201caesthetic.\u201d\nWhere one stands in this debate depends much on the scope of evidence\nconsidered relevant to the question (Devereaux 1998). Claims for a\ntradition of feminine aesthetics have been widely criticized for\nessentializing women and ignoring their many social and historical\ndifferences (Meagher 2011). At the same time, as Cornelia Klinger\nobserves, speculations about a women\u2019s art tradition seem, in\nretrospect, to be more sophisticated than the label\n\u201cessentialism\u201d implies, because they move beyond\negalitarian liberalism and recognize the enduring influences of gender\nin aesthetic productions (Klinger 1998, 350; Eaton 2008). As with\nvirtually all philosophical questions, those concerning commonalities\namong women artists are revisited from time to time. (In 2015 a\nconference in Cork, Ireland, was devoted to the topic of\n\u201cAesthetics and the Feminine\u201d (Edwards 2016).)\n\nThe latter perspective characterizes those scholars who defend the\nidea that experiences of female embodiment can be manifest in\ndistinctive expressive styles that yet accommodate difference. The\nmost elaborate theoretical framework supporting this approach is\nprovided by work loosely described as \u201cFrench feminisms.\u201d\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous famously proposed the notion of\n\u00e9criture f\u00e9minine, positing that the expression\nof women\u2019s lived experience might be impressed in women\u2019s\nliterary production in linguistic styles that offer alternatives to\nstandard objective description and linear temporal development (Cixous\n1975/1981). Although they proceed from varying theoretical\nfoundations, including different interpretations of psychoanalytic\ntheory, Luce Irigaray\u2019s notion of writing the body and Julia\nKristeva\u2019s positing of modes of semiotic expression that escape\npatriarchal symbolic discourse, propose parallel methods to\ndistinguish creativity distinct from androcentric styles (Irigaray\n1974 [1985]). They need not characterize the writing only of women,\nhowever; Kristeva\u2019s theory of the semiotic posits that poetic\nlanguage taps expressive pre-symbolic resources flowing from infantile\nexperiences in the mother-child dyad (Kristeva 1984). With or without\nthe psychoanalytic frameworks employed by their originators, such\nideas have proven fruitful resources for feminist scholars working in\na variety of philosophical traditions. For example, Jane Duran has\nexamined the fiction of writers as different as the British novelist\nMargaret Drabble and the African-American writer Toni Cade Bambara to\ndisclose how expressing embodied experience shares certain traits that\nare manifest quite differently when inflected by race, social\nposition, and cultural legacy (Duran 2007).\n\nThe critique of tradition that fosters \u201cwriting the\nfeminine\u201d proceeds from the discovery of a lack at the heart of\nartistic representation, an absence of voices positioned to express\nthe subjectivities of those who occupy the margins of social power. In\ncounterpoint, Ewa Plonowska Ziarek notes that worlds of art have also\nprovided a wealth of resources to uncover realities of gender,\nsexuality, social position, and race. However, the project of\ndeveloping feminist aesthetics has often been eclipsed by the\npolitical urgencies thereby disclosed, sidelining feminism within\naesthetics and aesthetics within feminism. Ziarek examines the works\nof modernist women writers, arguing that the very artistic form of\ntheir works unifies the efforts of feminism and political practice in\n\u201ccomplex relations between political and aesthetic\ntransformations, their relation to gender and race differences, and\nthe role of materiality in political contestation and aesthetic\ninvention\u201d (Ziarek 2012a, 392; Ziarek 2012b).\n",
