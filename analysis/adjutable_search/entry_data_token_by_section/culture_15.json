    "main_text": "Majority Cultural Rights Claims || Cultural continuity and exclusion rights\n3.1 Cultural continuity and exclusion rights\n\nOne domain in which majority communities claim a cultural right is in\nthe space of immigration. For some, the right of states to shape their\nculture can legitimately serve as a reason to exclude others, in\ngeneral and sometimes specific others. This view is often attributed\nto Michael Walzer, who argues that the right of a state to control its\nborders is intimately connected to its capacity to\n\n\ndefend the liberty and welfare, the politics and culture of a\ngroup of people committed to one another and to their common life.\n(Walzer 1983: 39, emphasis added)\n\n\nThe right of a state to control its culture is therefore an essential\none to protect its \u201ccollective consciousness\u201d, as noted in\nSection 1.\n\nThis claim has encountered pushback from many scholars, for multiple\nreasons. One reason is that the claim that a state may exclude\nwould-be migrants for cultural reasons has too often been, in\nfact, an attempt to enact discriminatory legislation aimed at\nexcluding migrants whose beliefs and practices are said\u00a0to be\nincompatible with, or even undermining of, the values and norms that\ndefine the majority\u2019s culture. Exclusion based on so-called\ncultural reasons has often been a claim that a state prefers to remain\nculturally, religiously, ethnically, and racially homogeneous.\nHistorically, states engaged explicitly in such discriminatory\npractices, which have now been repudiated, including for example\nvariants of Asian Exclusion Acts which were in operation in North\nAmerica in the early 1900s.\n\nThe same accusation is also merited in several recent cases, such as\nthe implementation of the so-called Muslim Ban in the United States,\nor with respect to proposals during the height of the crisis in Syria\n(2015) in some countries to prioritize Christian over Muslim refugees\n(Song 2018). Among political theorists of immigration, there is\nhowever widespread repudiation of discriminatory immigration policies,\nboth explicitly and implicitly, even among those who defend the\ngeneral right of states to exclude would-be migrants and refugees, for\nmany reasons including to preserve culture (Miller 2005).\n\nA second source of pushback stems from a more general skepticism that\na majority\u2019s culture, even if genuinely valuable to its members,\nshould be treated as sufficiently so to warrant excluding migrants,\nespecially necessitous ones (the language of necessity is borrowed\nfrom Song 2018). Even if it is conceded that culture is valuable to a\nmajority, many scholars believe that its protection cannot warrant\nexcluding those in severe need of safety or subsistence.\n\nYet, say those who defend the view that culture can, at least in some\ncases, serve to exclude migrants, there is a case to be made for\ntreating the state as possessing the right to cultural continuity\n(Miller 2005). This claimed right looks very much like the right to\ncultural preservation (or against cultural loss) described above, and\nit highlights not so much the sentimental dimensions of a\nmajority\u2019s attachment to its culture, but rather its pragmatic\ninterpretation. On this view, any particular state is defined by a\n\u201cshared public culture\u201d which, because shared, underpins\nthe trust that democratic states rely on to pursue political and\nsocial objectives in common. No particular value that makes up a\nshared public culture is valuable in and of itself. Rather, it is the\ncombination of a set of values, norms, and practices, that produces\n\u201cour\u201d culture that is valuable, and in its presence, trust\nis higher; as a result, so is the willingness to cooperate to support\npolicies that require some sacrifice, including for example,\ncommitment to redistributive social policies that are especially to\nthe benefit of those who are least well-off (e.g., see the essays in\nGustavsson & Miller 2019). So, according to those who defend these\nviews, a\u00a0state that seeks to exert control over admission citing\n\u201ccultural\u201d reasons is neither racist nor discriminatory,\nbut rather is seeking controlled admission (rather than closed\nborders) so that newcomers can, over a sufficient time period, come to\nadopt enough of the set of defining values, norms, and practices, to\nbe able to warrant and extend the trust that underpins the policies\nthat instantiate these objectively valued goods.\n",
