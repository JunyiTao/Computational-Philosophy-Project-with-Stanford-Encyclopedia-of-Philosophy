    "main_text": "Beneficence in Biomedical Ethics || Social Beneficence and Social Justice\n6.5 Social Beneficence and Social Justice\n\n\nSome of the most important issues in the ethics of health and health\ncare today are widely classified as issues of social justice. However,\nat the hands of many writers, social justice is notably similar to\nsocial beneficence. For example, perhaps the most important moral\nproblem in global ethics is how to structure both the global order and\nnational systems that affect health so that burdens are avoided,\nbenefits are provided, and then both are fairly distributed using a\nthreshold condition of equitable levels of health and access to health\ncare. Globalization has brought a realization that problems of\nprotecting health and providing beneficial services are international\nin nature and that their alleviation will require a restructuring of\nthe global system.\n\n\nJohn Rawls\u2019s A Theory of Justice has been enormously\ninfluential in advanced work on these problems in biomedical ethics.\nRawls argues that a social arrangement forming a political state is a\ncommunal effort to advance the good of all in the society. His starting\nassumptions are layered with beneficent, egalitarian goals of making\nthe unequal situation of the naturally disadvantaged members of society\nboth better and more equal. His recognition of a positive societal\nobligation to eliminate or reduce barriers that prevent fair\nopportunity and that correct or compensate for various disadvantages\nhas implications for discussions of both beneficence and justice in\nhealth care.\n\n\nRawls himself never pursued these health-centered issues, but his\ntheory has influenced many writers on moral problems of health and\nbiomedical ethics, including Norman Daniels, Martha Nussbaum, and the\nteam of Madison Powers and Ruth Faden. One of Daniels\u2019 main questions\nis \u201cHow can we meet health needs fairly under reasonable limits\nto resources committed to the task?\u201d The \u201cfairly\u201d\npart of this formulation may be justice-based, but the notion of\n\u201creasonable limits to resources\u201d is closely tied to the\nproblems of the limits of beneficence mentioned previously. Daniels\nargues that because health is affected by many social factors, theories\nof justice should not center entirely on access to health care, but\nalso on the need to reduce health inequalities by improving social\nconditions that affect the health of societies, such as having clean\nwater, adequate nutrition, and general sanitation.\n\n\nPowers and Faden view the well-being of the worst-off members of\nglobal society as the proper starting point for a practical theory of\njustice, but their theory can also be expressed as an argument from\nsocial beneficence. The sweep of global poverty and its impact on\nhealth and welfare is a major topic in the theories of Singer and\nPowers and Faden. The consequences of extreme poverty for health are\nwell-documented, and these consequences inform Powers and Faden\u2019s\ntheories of both basic well-being and justice. Their theory also\nidentifies unfair patterns of advantage and unfair relations of power\nsuch as subordination, exploitation, and social exclusion that are\nrooted in unjust social-structural conditions. Among other things,\ntheir theory assesses the degree to which institutional structures can\nbe expected to fulfill the mandates of the theory.\n\n\nRecently, \u201ccapability theory\u201d has, at the hands of\nvarious writers from several disciplines, merged concerns of justice\nand beneficence. This type of theory focuses on distributions intended\nto enable persons to reach certain functional levels essential for a\nflourishing life that is protected by social institutions. The idea is\nto start with an understanding of health and individual well-being and\nthen to connect that account to basic capabilities for achieving levels\nof functioning essential to well-being\u2014through, for example,\nproper nutrition and access to health care. Some core capabilities are\nbodily health, ability to play, ability to affiliate socially, freedom\nof movement, and adequate educational level. Amartya Sen and Martha\nNussbaum are advocates of a capabilities theory.\n\n\nSome writers closely connected to bioethics and health policy have\nmoved beyond capabilities theory with a twist toward beneficence and\nwell-being. Powers and Faden provide a theory closely connected to\nglobal health policy. They start with a basic premise: Social justice\nis concerned with human well-being\u2014not only health, but what they\ncall six distinct, core dimensions of well-being. The six are health,\npersonal security, reasoning, respect, attachment, and\nself-determination. Each of these dimensions is an independent concern\nof justice. While this list of six dimensions is in some respects\nsimilar to Nussbaum\u2019s\u2014for example, \u201cattachment\u201d\nresembles what Nussbaum calls \u201caffiliation\u201d\u2014Powers\nand Faden reject the language of capabilities as misleading and wide of\nthe target of theories of justice and beneficence. Theirs is a list of\nessential core dimensions of well-being, not core capabilities. Being\nhealthy, being secure, and being respected are desirable states of\nbeing, not merely capabilities or functionings. For example, we want\nnot merely the capability to be well-nourished, but to\nbe well-nourished.\n\n\nIn this theory the justice and beneficence of societies and of the\nglobal order are to be judged by how well they effect these well-being\ndimensions in their political structures and social practices. The job\nof global justice and beneficence is to secure a sufficient level of\neach dimension for persons and to alleviate the social structures that\ncause the corresponding forms of ill-being. This theory of well-being\nand its place in moral theory and social policy can be expressed in\nterms of the roles of both social beneficence and social justice.\n",
