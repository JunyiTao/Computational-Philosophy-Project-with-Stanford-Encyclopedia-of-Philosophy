Obligationes as a branch of logic\n\nAs a branch of logic, obligations came to flourish with European\nmedieval logic from the thirteenth century onwards, and they slowly\nvanished when logic as a discipline, a.k.a. \u2018scholastic\nlogic\u2019 retreated in the early modern times. During the peak\nperiod in the fourteenth century, many or perhaps even most European\nlogicians wrote a dedicated text on obligations (de\nobligationibus). These texts were either stand-alone treatises or\nsections in overall presentations of logic. Of the former kind,\ntreatises by Walter Burley (\u201cTreatise on Obligations\u201d,\nwritten c. 1302; Latin text in Green [1963], English translation in\nKretzmann and Stump [1988]), Roger Swyneshed (written 1330\u201335;\nSpade [1977]) and Robert\n Eland[1]\n (written 1335\u20131370; Spade [1980]) have been particularly\nimportant in shaping the modern understanding of the topic. Of the\nlatter kind, for example William Ockham\u2019s Summa logicae\n(written c. 1323; Boehner, G\u00e1l, & Brown [1974]) and Paul of\nVenice\u2019s Logica magna (written 1397\u201398; Ashworth\n[1988]) can be mentioned as outstanding examples.\n\nThe technique of obligations assumes a dialectical setting or even\nsomething like a game between two persons. This setting is usually\nvery succinctly described in the texts themselves. In a nutshell, what\nhappens in an obligational disputation is that one person, the\nopponent, is putting forward propositions\n (propositiones)[2]\n and another person, the respondent, is expected to give direct\nevaluations of these propositions as they come. There are two main\nanswers, granting the proposition or denying it. Only rarely, the\ntexts allow other answers like doubting the proposition (see e.g.,\nUckelman, Maat and Rybalko 2018). The sequence of propositions put\nforward and answered is taken to be a temporal sequence, but most\nauthors thought that the truth values of the propositions are not to\nbe taken to change during the disputation.\n\nThe sequence of propositions evaluated this way is launched by the\nopponent giving the respondent a specified obligation, in the paradigm\ncase that of granting an obviously false proposition. This specified\nobligation must be respected throughout the sequence, regardless of\nhow complex the sequence gets. The underlying idea is that although\nthe specified obligation relieves the respondent from always following\ntruth in the evaluations, the requirement of some kind of logical\ncoherence is not suspended.\n\nThese special obligations come in different varieties. Most medieval\ntreatments of the branch of logic are divided by discussions of\ndifferent varieties. The most common is called\n\u2018positio\u2019, or \u2018laying down\u2019. In\n\u2018positio\u2019 a false proposition is laid down at the\nbeginning of the disputation, and the respondent remains obligated to\ngrant it whenever the opponent puts it forward. Modern attention has\nbeen mainly on positio. (On \u2018sit verum\u2019,\nsee Spade 1994\u201397 and Uckelman 2015.)\n\nWalter Burley, for example, discusses six kinds of obligations (Green\n1963, Kretzmann and Stump 1988):\n\n(1)\n\u2018Positio\u2019, where a specified proposition\nneeds to be always granted.\n(2)\n\u2018Depositio\u2019 where a specified proposition\nneeds to be always denied.\n(3)\n\u2018Dubitatio\u2019, where a specified proposition\nneeds to be always doubted.\n(4)\n\u2018Institutio\u2019 or\n\u2018impositio\u2019 where a new meaning is given to some\nlinguistic item.\n(5)\n\u2018Sit verum\u2019, where a specified proposition is\nto be taken as true.\n(6)\n\u2018Petitio\u2019, where some other requirement is\nput on the respondent.\n\n\nOf these kinds only (1), (2), and (4) are commonly addressed in later\ndiscussions of the genre, but all of them can be found in texts other\nthan Burley\u2019s treatise. However, for a general understanding of\nthe technique it does not seem necessary to account for varieties\nother than \u2018positio\u2019.\n\nAlmost all the medieval dedicated treatments of obligations proceed\nthrough giving rules on how the respondent ought to give the\nevaluations, or what is to be granted and what is to be denied. The\nessential rules are based on the idea that each proposition put\nforward must be recognized as \u2018relevant\u2019 or\n\u2018irrelevant\u2019 in relation to the obligation given at the\nbeginning. Thus, if the respondent is given as a\n\u2018positio\u2019 the proposition \u2018Plato is\nrunning\u2019, the proposition \u2018Plato is moving\u2019, and\nindeed any proposition following from \u2018Plato is running\u2019\nis to be deemed sequentially relevant. Similarly, any proposition\nincompatible with \u2018Plato is running\u2019 is to be deemed\nincompatibly relevant: \u2018Plato is sitting\u2019 will have to be\ndenied. On the other hand, \u2018Socrates is running\u2019 is to be\ndeemed irrelevant at least if it is put forward immediately after the\n\u2018positio\u2019, since there is no logical connection\nbetween Plato and Socrates running.\n\nThe core two rules of \u2018positio\u2019 require the\nrespondent to grant any sequentially relevant proposition, and to deny\nany incompatibly relevant proposition. These two rules are accepted by\nall authors, but under different interpretations. Since obligational\ndisputations are technically constituted by sequences of propositions\nwith their respective responses, what is relevant and what is not at a\nparticular step need not be determined solely by the\n\u2018positio\u2019. Also, within the context of\nobligations, it cannot be taken as univocally given how\n\u2018follows\u2019 (sequitur), or the logical consequence\nrelation, is to be understood.\n\nThe core terminology of obligations centers around \u2018has to be\ngranted\u2019 (est concedendum) and \u2018has to be\ndenied\u2019 (est negandum). These expressions were widely\nused in medieval European academic texts even outside logic, but\nnormally with the implication that things that have to be granted are\ntrue, and vice versa, what is true must be granted. In obligations\ntreatises, both the connection and the contrast of these expressions\nto truth is of special importance. What is true and what has to be\ngranted are often not the same thing, because propositions are granted\nas following from the false positio, or on the basis of some\nother special obligation. That the terms \u2018has to be\ngranted\u2019 and \u2018has to be denied\u2019 are used in general\nacademic contexts outside obligations can presumably be attributed to\nthe fact that medieval academia predominantly thought about arguments\nin a dialectical context. Obligations as such would not always be at\nissue when such terms are used. But it does seem that at least in the\nfourteenth century, obligations as a branch of logic was taken to\naddress core aspects of what it means when something has to be granted\nin an argumentative setting.\n\nThe medieval logical genre of sophismata (see the entry on\n sophismata\n in this encyclopedia) appears especially relevant to obligations. A\ntypical sophism in this sense consists of a case (casus), a\nsophisma sentence, arguments for and against the sophisma sentence\nbased on the case, and a solution. The case is often imagined rather\nthan real or even genuinely possible. One relatively natural way to\nthink of a sophism would thus be to take the case (casus) as\na positio in the sense of obligational disputations. Indeed,\nRichard Kilvington\u2019s comments of the obligational rules in his\nSophismata show him thinking that obligational rules regulate\nhow one ought to evaluate sentences on the basis of the case\n(casus) in a sophisma. (See Kretzmann & Kretzmann 1990a\nand 1990b.)\n2. Background in Aristotelian logic\n\nThe core structure of an obligational disputation is closely similar\nto what we find from Plato\u2019s dialogues. In a so-called Socratic\nelenchus Socrates is putting forward questions, and most of\nthem can be and are answered by \u2018yes\u2019 or by\n\u2018no\u2019. The sequence of questions in effect builds up an\nargument leading to a situation where the person responding to\nSocrates\u2019 questions is often forced to admit the opposite of\nwhat was put as a starting point in the dialectical encounter. As a\ncore background assumption, the person answering has to grant to\nSocrates some propositions because of other propositions that he has\nalready granted. In a somewhat implicit form, the obligational\nprinciple that whatever follows needs to be granted is thus present\nalready in the Socratic elenchus. (See e.g., Robinson\n1953)\n\nThere are however very central differences between the medieval\nobligational disputations and the Socratic elenchus. Indeed,\nit seems possible to sum up the similarities as two core ideas:\n\nBoth are dialectical encounters constituted by one party putting\nforward propositions and the other evaluating them.\nBoth are taken to proceed in a form that is logical, although in\nthe case of Plato the term \u2018logical\u2019 needs to be taken\nwith caution for anachronism.\n\n\nThe main difference between Socratic elenchus and medieval\nobligational disputations is in what happens at the beginning. While\nSocrates normally challenges his discussion partner on a substantial\nphilosophical thesis whose truth would be important to know, there is\nno real issue under scrutiny in obligational disputations. The thesis\nstudied in a Socratic elenchus is never known to be obviously\nfalse, but this is the standard way to start an obligational\ndisputation.\n\nAs is well known, Aristotle developed dialectical encounters in a\nstrictly theoretical manner in his Topics. One question that\nis still open in the modern scholarship on obligations is to account\nfor the role of Aristotle\u2019s Topics in the development\nof the obligations genre in the middle ages. Medieval commentaries on\nTopics do not regularly take up to discuss obligations\nsystematically (see Green-Pedersen 1984). One interesting exception is\nBoethius of Dacia\u2019s commentary (written in the 1270s;\nBreen-Pedersen & Pinborg 1976), but the rules that he proposes for\nobligational disputations appear quite different from what we find\nfrom the mainstream authors of the genre itself (e.g., Burley,\nSwyneshed, and Eland). In any case, even judging on the basis of\nBoethius\u2019 treatment of the technique in the commentary, the\ntechnique does not seem a direct descendant of the so called\n\u2018topical\u2019 tradition in logic.\n\nThere is another medieval descendant of the structure of the Socratic\nelenchus arising more directly from the Aristotelian approach\nto the technique in his Topics. During the thirteenth\ncentury, a number of treatises \u201cOn the Modes of Opposing and\nResponding\u201d were written. (Cf. De Rijk 1980,\nP\u00e9rez-Ilzarbe 2011). These treatises discuss and develop\ntechniques of winning in a disputation, or in other words ways in\nwhich the opponent can force or trick the respondent into granting the\nopposite of the thesis under dispute, or ways in which the respondent\ncan avoid such contradictions. These treatises form an interesting\nparallel to the obligations technique, but even there the core feature\nof obligations \u2013 discussing an obviously false thesis \u2013 is\nnot to be found.\n\nAristotle discussed various times (e.g., Prior Analytics and\nMetaphysics) what may happen in reasoning that starts with an\nimpossible hypothesis, and these discussions have to be taken into\naccount as a second aspect in which obligational disputations have\nroots in Aristotle\u2019s works. When reasoning from an impossible\nhypothesis one is not to worry about truth but about what follows\nlogically. This is one of the central technical issues in obligational\ndisputations. Discussions concerning an impossible hypothesis have a\nlong history that can be traced all the way from Aristotle to the\nLatin medieval period in which obligational disputations properly so\ncalled were developed. And it can also be pointed out that at the\nearliest stages of the Latin medieval development of obligational\ntechnique, assuming an impossibility (positio impossibilis)\nwas one, or perhaps even the standard kind of obligation to be\nconsidered. (See Martin 1993; 1997; 2007; Kukkonen 2002; 2005.)\n\nJudging from texts known to modern scholars, the obligational\ntechnique seems to have achieved a structured format during the\nthirteenth century, perhaps already in its first half. The oldest\ncurrently known dedicated treatises on the obligational technique seem\nto be a pair of anonymous treatises edited by L. M. de Rijk as\nThe Emmeran Treatise on False Positio and The\nEmmeran Treatise on Impossible Positio. (De Rijk 1974.) De Rijk\ndated the treatises in his edition to the early thirteenth century,\nand there seems to be no reason to doubt this rough date. The rules of\nthe technique are in these treatises almost the same as in Walter\nBurley\u2019s Treatise on Obligations,\nwhich might be taken as the standard bearing treatise, written around\n1302 (Green 1963; Kretzmann and Stump 1988). In terms of historical\ndevelopment, the obligational technique belongs to what is often\ncalled logica moderna, which built on Aristotelian logic but\ntook clear distance from the Aristotelian texts themselves.\n3. Walter Burley\u2019s standard theory\n\nAccording to Walter Burley\u2019s presentation of the obligational\ntheory in the species of positio, the respondent faces a\nsequence of propositions that he must either grant or deny, one by\none. The sequence starts with a positum that is normally a\nfalse sentence which the respondent has to grant. Then the following\npropositions are evaluated in accordance with what Burley calls the\nessential rules of obligations. Three of these rules can be found from\npractically all medieval discussions of the technique. According to\nthem, the positum must be granted if it is put forward,\nanything following from the positum must be granted, and\nanything incompatible with the positum must be denied. (Cf.\nGreen 1963, Kretzmann and Stump 1988. Modern discussions of\nBurley\u2019s rules can be found in e.g., Ashworth 1981; Keffer 2001;\nSpade 1982; Spade and Stump 1983; Stump 1985; Yrj\u00f6nsuuri 1994 and\n2001.)\n\nIn Burley\u2019s formulations the core rules are as follows:\n\n1.\nEverything that is posited and put forward in the form of the\npositum during the time of the positio must be\ngranted.\n2.\nEverything that follows from the positum must be\ngranted.\n3.\nEverything incompatible with the positum must be\ndenied.\n\n\nAlready these rules show that the technique (in Burley\u2019s\nversion) is aiming at consistency in the answers. He seems to have\nthis insight in mind when he gives later in the treatise a\n\u201cuseful rule\u201d that \u201call responses must be directed\nto the same instant\u201d, as if implying that any description of one\ninstant of time needs to be consistent.\n\nThe above three basic rules are not sufficient, as they cover only\nwhat follows from the positum alone or is incompatible with\nit alone. An important part of the obligational technique is to\nunderstand all propositions put forward in an obligational disputation\nas either relevant (pertinens) or irrelevant\n(impertinens). A proposition that follows or is incompatible,\nis relevant, and others are irrelevant. Relevant propositions are to\nbe answered according to their logical status, or in other words\naccording to rules 2. and 3. On how to answer irrelevant propositions,\nBurley gives the following rule:\n\n4.\nIf it is irrelevant, it must be responded to on the basis of its\nown quality.\n\n\nAs Burley carefully explains, \u201cits own quality\u201d means what\nwe take its truth value to be. Thus, a proposition known to be true\nmust be granted, and one known to be false must be denied. Answering\nwith doubt is also possible, according to Burley.\n\nThe rule concerning irrelevant propositions is generally accepted by\nall medieval authors writing on obligations, but in importantly\ndifferent exact versions. We will come back to some of these versions\nin the following, but first we must make clear about Burley\u2019s\nversion. He puts special attention to the following question: a\nproposition is relevant if it follows or is incompatible, but follows\nfrom exactly what, or is incompatible with exactly what? As Burley\nsees it, this relevance must be determined on the basis of all answers\nthat have been given in the disputation so far. On the first step\nimmediately after the positio, relevance is based on\nfollowing from the positum, or being incompatible with it.\nBut suppose the respondent must evaluate some salient irrelevant\nproposition on the first step. Then this answer must be taken into\naccount in determining whether a later proposition follows or is\nincompatible in the disputation. That is, the respondent must take\ncare not only that he does not deny his positum but that all\nhis answers remain consistent as a set.\n\nBurley formulated these ideas as further clarifications of rules 2.\nand 3., but let us here give them new numbers:\n\n5.\nEverything that follows from the positum either together\nwith an already granted proposition (or propositions), or together\nwith the opposite of a proposition (or the opposites of propositions)\nalready correctly denied and known to be such, must be granted.\n6.\nEverything that is incompatible with the positum together\nwith an already granted proposition (or propositions), or together\nwith the opposite of a proposition (or the opposites of propositions)\nalready correctly denied and known to be such, must be denied.\n\n\nA crucial effect of these rules is that at every step where an\nirrelevant proposition is answered, the class of relevant propositions\nexpands. Burley makes this explicit through a \u201cuseful\nrule\u201d that \u201cone must pay special attention to the order\n[of the propositions]\u201d. Something that is irrelevant at the\nfirst step might not be so anymore later in the disputation.\n\nNow, consider the following disputation as an example:\n\n\n\n\nPositum\nYou are in Rome.\nAccepted as possible. \n\nProposition\u00a01\nYou are not in Rome or you are a bishop\nGranted, true and irrelevant (rule 4). \n\nProposition\u00a02\nYou are a bishop.\nGranted, follows (rule 5).  \n\n\nDisputation D1\n\n\nAccording to Burley\u2019s approach, proposition 1 has to be\nevaluated as irrelevant, because it does not follow from the\npositum alone, and because of the first disjunct it is taken\nto be true even if the respondent is not a bishop (apologies to any\nreader actually in Rome). It must therefore be granted. However, this\nanswer makes the other disjunct relevant, because the first disjunct\nhappens to be the negation of the positum. Thus, Proposition\n2 must be granted. Indeed, by suitable selection of propositions,\nalmost anything at all may have to be granted at the later steps of a\ndisputation with a false positum. Burley gives a useful rule\nto make this clear: \u201cwhen a false contingent proposition is\nposited, one can prove any false proposition that is compossible with\nit.\u201d (Kretzmann and Stump 1988, 391.)\n\nBurley uses the word \u201ccompossible\u201d\n(compossibile). It is important to notice that at the time\nBurley was writing, the concept of consistency was not a standard part\nof technical logical language. He and his contemporaries did not speak\nabout consistent sets of sentences, because they did not have the\nvocabulary. This seems like a simple reason why Burley never says\ndirectly and explicitly that all answers must stick to consistency.\nInstead, it seems more probable that building the concept was a part\nof the development in the obligational technique.\n\nIn any case, the above example and the principle that almost anything\nmay have to be granted are not problematic in Burley\u2019s eyes.\nThis reflects a clear-eyed understanding that obligational\ndisputations were not about what is true and what is not, they were\nabout logical relationships between sentences.\n4. Revisions of the rules\n\nWalter Burley\u2019s rules of obligational disputations can be called\nthe standard approach, but they were also challenged in the fourteenth\ncentury discussions. All these challenges may be taken to be directed\nat understanding in what sense the respondent must avoid contradicting\nhimself in an obligational disputation.\n\nTime and modality. When discussing modalities in his\nOrdinatio (I, d. 38, 2), John Duns Scotus rejects a principle\nwhich he calls an obligational rule, namely that with a false\npositio one must \u201cdeny the present instant\u201d. And\nin fact, Walter Burley (writing roughly at the same time) mentions\nthis as a valid, useful rule. The reasoning behind the rule is the\nnecessity of the present. For example, suppose \u201cyou are\nrunning\u201d is the false positum when you are in fact\nstanding in a university hall and participating in an obligational\ndisputation. Now, if one considers the possibility that you are\nrunning, this possibility must according to Burley be referred to some\nother time, because of the necessity of the present. You cannot be\nrunning now since you are standing now, but afterwards you can of\ncourse run. (Kretzmann and Stump 1988, 394.)\n\nDuns Scotus denied the necessity of the present and thought that it\nneed not be incoherent to consider actually false propositions as\npossible at the present instant. That you are standing does not\nexclude that you are running is a logical possibility, it only\nexcludes actual running. This kind of thinking has been found to\nreflect a major change in how alethic modalities are conceived. After\nScotus, many thinkers thought of modalities as related to\nconceivability and logic, and not so much as based on being in\nsomeone\u2019s power, or true at some time or other. That is, the\npossibility of a proposition became taken to be an issue unrelated to\nthe flow of time.\n\nThis change is visible in obligations treatises. When Burley mentions\ndenying the present instant as a useful rule, he takes up a topic that\nis found in the earlier treatises, but in fact not often in later\ntreatises. It looks as if Scotus\u2019 rejection of the rule became\naccepted.\n\nCounterfactual thinking. Richard Kilvington comments on\nobligations in his Sophismata (S47; Kretzmann & Kretzmann\n1990a; 1990b). In his view, it should not be possible to force the\nrespondent to grant any falsities whatsoever, and the order in which\npropositions are put forward ought not to have an effect on their\nevaluation. As Kilvington sees it, the respondent should grant only\nthose falsities which would be true if the positum were true.\nKilvington gives the following example (S47, (q); Kretzmann &\nKretzmann 1990b, 127\u20138):\n\n\n\n\nPositum\nYou are in Rome.\nAccepted as possible. \n\nProposition\u00a01\n\u2018You are in Rome\u2019 and \u2018you are a bishop\u2019\nare similar in truth value.\nDenied, since you are not a bishop. \n\nProposition\u00a02\nYou are a bishop.\nDenied, does not follow.  \n\n\nDisputation D2\n\n\nAssuming that the respondent is not in Rome or a bishop both of the\npropositions mentioned in Proposition 1 are false. According\nBurley\u2019s rules, Proposition 1 would have to be granted as\nirrelevant and true. But after having granted Proposition 1, it may\nappear that Proposition 2 follows and must be granted. According to\nKilvington, that should not be so. Indeed, he goes directly on to\ngenerally denying Burley\u2019s useful rule that anything false that\nis compossible with the positum may have to be granted. By\nKilvington\u2019s comparison, the respondent is bound or obligated by\nthe positum \u201cyou are in Rome\u201d to answer as he\nwould if he were in Rome. Thus, he ought not to grant \u201cyou are a\nbishop\u201d unless he is a bishop.\n\nWhen concluding his discussion of the example, Kilvington describes\nProposition 1 as one \u201cthat is true now and that would not be\ntrue in virtue of its being in fact as is signified by the\npositum\u201d (S47, (cc); Kretzmann & Kretzmann 1990b,\n131). Kilvington is thus inviting the respondent to think\ncounterfactually when defending a false positum, and as he\ncontinues, he applies this to how one ought to answer when evaluating\na sophisma. One ought to grant what would be true and deny what would\nbe false, given the positum.\n\nAn anonymous treatise De arte obligatoria probably from the\n1330s (edited and translated from a Merton College manuscript in\nKretzmann & Stump 1985) seems to develop a central aspect of\nKilvington\u2019s suggestion into a complete set of rules for\nobligational disputations. Just like Kilvington, the anonymous author\nthought that in an obligational disputation the order of the\npropositions ought not influence the answers. The core change to\nBurley\u2019s rules is that rules 5. and 6. above are revised so that\ninstead of referring to earlier answers, they must refer to\npropositions which would be true if the positum was true.\nThus, a proposition must be granted as sequentially relevant, if it\nfollows from the positum together with a proposition that\nwould be true if the positum were true. Similarly, it has to\ndenied as incompatibly relevant if it is incompatible with the\npositum together with a proposition that would be true if the\npositum were true. The result is that all answers must be\ngiven \u201cin accordance with how it is possible for things to\nbe\u201d, or \u201con the basis of the facts then\u201d, as the\nanonymous author puts it.\n\nThis approach was not followed in later theories of\nobligationes. It may be that obligations were thought of as\nconcerned with relations between propositions rather than building a\ndescription of a possible situation that could be imagined. The\nanonymous author\u2019s approach requires the respondent to imagine\nwhat the situation would be like if the positum were true and\ngive evaluations on the basis of that situation. Thus, the evaluations\nwould not be based on the logical relations between the various\npropositions of the disputation itself. If obligational disputations\nwere conceived as a tool for examining logical relations between\npropositions, such counterfactual thinking may not be the best way to\nproceed.\n\nAccepting contradictions. There is also another direction\ninto which Kilvington\u2019s comments can be developed. In another\ncomment on the example D2 above, Kilvington says that the respondent\ncould grant Proposition 1 and deny Proposition 2 (S47, (bb); Kretzmann\n& Kretzmann 1990b, 131). His point is that when the propositions\n\u2018you are in Rome\u2019 and \u2018you are a bishop\u2019 are\nclaimed to be similar in truth value, they are mentioned rather than\nused. Given that the meanings of these strings of words is not\nlogically necessary, it might be that Proposition 1 (claiming that the\ntwo mentioned propositions are similar in truth value) has nothing to\ndo with the respondent being in Rome or being a bishop. Thus,\nProposition 2 does not follow from the positum and\nProposition 1 together.\n\nThis approach is even stronger in a related discussion where\nKilvington rejects what is nowadays called Tarskian biconditionals, or\nthe equivalence between a proposition and the claim that the\nproposition is true. Logically, inferring that you are in Rome from\nthe claim that the sentence \u2018you are in Rome\u2019 is true is\nvalid only if \u2018you are in Rome\u2019 means that you are in\nRome. (S47, (t); Kretzmann & Kretzmann 1990b, 128.)\n\nIt seems that in his treatise on obligationes, Roger\nSwyneshed developed his rules for obligational disputations with an\napproach like this (the text is edited in Spade 1977). Especially\ninteresting in this respect is his discussion on impositio,\nor the kind of obligational disputation where a new meaning is given\nto some linguistic entity. According to Swyneshed, even if the\nrespondent were obligated by the impositio that \u2018you\nare a donkey\u2019 means that God exists, the respondent must deny\nbeing a donkey. The proposition \u201c\u2018you are a donkey\u2019\nis true\u201d must however be granted. According to Swyneshed\u2019s\nprinciple, \u201cbecause of an impositio of some proposition\nthe answer to be given to it is not to be changed\u201d (Spade 1977,\n254). It seems thus that the impositio influences only\nsituations where the proposition at issue is mentioned rather than\nused.\n\nRecent scholarship has found Swyneshed\u2019s rules for\npositio more puzzling (see e.g., Spade 1982; Stump 1981;\nYrj\u00f6nsuuri 1994 and 2001). They are very clear in terms of how to\nanswer according to them, but it seems very problematic to give a\nsensible interpretation to the set of evaluations to be given\naccording to them. Swyneshed simply rejects Burley\u2019s rules 5 and\n6. Just like Kilvington and the above-mentioned anonymous author of\nDe arte obligatoria, Swyneshed does not allow the order of\nthe propositions to have any effect on the answers. However, he does\nnot allow counterfactual considerations either, but rather thinks that\nthe respondent must rely on logical relations between the propositions\nin giving the evaluations.\n\nAs Swyneshed recognizes, his rules may lead the respondent into\ngranting triads or larger sets of propositions containing\ncontradictions. In his formulation, \u201cthe conclusion must be\ngranted that three incompatible propositions must be granted, and\nfour, and so on\u201d (Spade 1977, 274). The sequence of propositions\nin D1 above is an example of this. The respondent cannot according to\nSwyneshed rely on Burley\u2019s rule 5 to grant Proposition 2.\nInstead, the respondent should grant a disjunction but deny both of\nits parts. Also, it may happen that a conjunction must be denied\ndespite granting both of its parts. These structural combinations are\nexplicitly accepted by Swyneshed (Spade 1977, 257).\n\nIt must be kept in mind that in each case of granting a contradictory\nset by Swyneshed\u2019s rules, at least one evaluation is given on\nthe basis of one proposition being relevant, and at least one other\nanswer on the basis of that proposition being irrelevant. Thus, if the\nevaluations of irrelevant propositions were not allowed to be mixed\nwith evaluations of relevant ones, these contradictions would not\narise. However, it seems that this is not how Swyneshed thought about\nthe rules, since he explicitly allows the contradictions without\ndiscussing the idea of two domains of interpretation.\n\nIn the context of obligations, Swyneshed does not say that it would be\nacceptable to grant or deny a contradictory pair of propositions in\nthe same disputation: he discusses contradictory triads, not pairs.\nHowever, in his discussion on the Liar\u2019s paradox, he goes as far\nas explicitly accepting that in some cases both contradictories are\nfalse (cf. Read 2020). This shows that Swyneshed\u2019s understanding\nof what contradictions are and how they behave in logic is somewhat\noutside the logical mainstream. Thus, it may be that further study may\nshed more light on how exactly he thought about allowing\ncontradictions in obligational evaluations of sets of\npropositions.\n\nHistorically, it seems that counterfactual thinking as an approach to\nobligations was mainly rejected, but Swyneshed\u2019s approach\ngarnered some following. Both of these approaches appear to take issue\nwith Burley\u2019s principle that the order of propositions has\ncrucial significance in how they are to be evaluated. Since\nSwyneshed\u2019s way of rejecting this principle found some\nfollowers, this fact may signal that his approach was taken to be\ncloser to what really is at issue in obligations as a genre of logic.\nHowever, generally speaking Burley\u2019s approach became the\nmainstream towards the end of the fourteenth century. Perhaps, taking\nthe order of propositions into account was taken to be less\nproblematic than Swyneshed\u2019s acceptance of contradictory\ntriads.\n5. Winning the game\n\nIf we look at obligational disputations from the modern logical point\nof view, it may appear hard to understand how the sequence of answers\nshould be understood. One tempting alternative would be to think that\nthe idea would be to describe a counterfactual situation. As pointed\nout above, this may be what Kilvington and the anonymous author were\naiming at. (See also Spade 1982, 1992, and 1993.) However, the\nmainstream of medieval authors writing on obligations did not accept\ntheir approach.\n\nThe mainstream understanding of the current research into the\nobligations treatises seems to emphasize in different ways that\naccording to the standard approach (exemplified here by Burley\u2019s\nrules) the set of all answers will be consistent. Thus, it may seem\nreasonable to understand obligational disputations as a kind of\nconsistency maintenance game. Given that in modern logic the concept\nof a possible world is often understood in terms of what a potentially\ninfinite consistent set of sentences describes, the sequence of\nanswers in an obligational disputation can perhaps be interpreted as\nan expanding description of a possible world.\n\nThe problem with this interpretation is that it does not fit\nSwyneshed\u2019s rules, which were accepted by some authors as a\nviable alternative to Burley\u2019s approach. As the rules stand, the\nset of all answers cannot be understood as a description of a possible\nworld, because it need not be consistent. The set of answers to\nrelevant propositions is consistent even according to\nSwyneshed\u2019s rules, but understanding that set as describing a\npossible world runs into the difficulty that that set does not expand\nfrom the logical closure of the positum, and thus it does not\ndescribe any possible world more fully than the positum\nalone.\n\nA crucial feature of the Socratic elenchus is that the\nanswerer is led to deny what has already been granted. Avoiding it to\nhappen that the respondent denies the positum is a central\nobjective in an obligational disputation, and Burley\u2019s rules\nappear to require that this objective is achieved through a consistent\nsequence of answers. Swyneshed allows contradictory triads. In other\nwords, the set of answers may become inconsistent but the respondent\nis not allowed to grant any \u201ccontradictory incompatible with the\npositum\u201d (Spade 1977, 274). It appears that even in\nSwyneshed\u2019s case a crucial interest is to explicate logical\nrelations between the propositions put forward by the opponent, and\nespecially as they relate to the positum. As a general\ndescription of what obligational disputations were about, consistency\nmay not be exactly the right word. Perhaps it would be more exact to\ndescribe obligations as aiming at a dynamic understanding of logical\nrelations within a set of propositions.\n\nThe square of opposition was an important tool in Aristotelian logic\nfor understanding contradiction and other relations between pairs of\nassertoric predicative propositions formed with the same categorematic\nterms. As has been recognized, John Buridan and other logicians\nexpanded this theory to the octagon of opposition to cover also modal\npropositions. Obligational disputations can be understood as an\nexpansion into another direction. An obligational disputation\nabstracts from the predication as the standard form of proposition and\nturns from the binary logical relations into examining logical\nrelations within a dynamically constructed sequence of propositions.\n(Cf. especially Dutilh Novaes 2005; 2007; 2011; Dutilh Novaes and\nUckelman 2016; Strobino 2011; Uckelman 2013; Yrj\u00f6nsuuri 2000;\n2015.)\n\nIn his discussion of obligationes from the very end of the\nfourteenth century, Paul of Venice compares obligations with another\ngenre of logic, saying that \u201cthe matter of obligations is only\nthe matter of consequences in a more subtle style\u201d (Paul of\nVenice in Ashworth 1988, 32). One aspect of what Paul of Venice means\nby this statement is presumably that both obligations and consequences\nare concerned with non-syllogistic logic. To this extent, this\ndescription of the theory of obligationes seems correct even\nfrom the modern vantage point. However, it does not seem quite right\nto think that an obligational disputation would try to spell out the\nlogical relation between an antecedent and a consequent, or even a set\nof premises and a conclusion. The logical relations considered in an\nobligational disputation are not distinctively binary. It seems that\nthey are often approached as logical relations becoming explicit only\nin a dynamic sequence of three or more propositions.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Modern Editions and Translations", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Anonymous (early 13<sup>th</sup> century), \u201cThe Emmeran\ntreatise on false Positio\u201d.
