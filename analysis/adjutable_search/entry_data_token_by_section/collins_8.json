Collins, Deism and Freethinking\n\nThe seventeenth and early eighteenth century in England saw a\nrationalist treatment of theology that spanned many competing groups\nfrom the Latitudinarians to the Dissenters to the Deists. Samuel\nHefelbower in The Relation of John Locke to English Deism\nremarks that among the progressives\u2014theologians, philosophers\nand deists\u2014all accepted a rationalistic religion. The question\nthen becomes what exactly is the role of reason vis \u00e0 vis\nrevelation. The discussion of the relation of reason to revelation\ngoes back at least to Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas\u2014that is\nto the scholastic authorities. Albert held that reason has a role to\nplay in religion, but there are questions where philosophy has no\nfinal answer and revelation must decide. Revelation is above reason\nbut not contrary to it. Thomas has a similar position (Hefelbower\n1918: 47). Locke holds that reason is responsible for determining what\ncounts as a genuine revelation. Locke also holds the view that there\nis revelation that tells us about things above reason but not contrary\nto it. \n\n\nThus that part of the Angels rebelled against GOD, and thereby lost\ntheir first happy state: And that the dead shall rise, and live again:\nThese, and the like, being beyond the Discovery of Reason, are purely\nmatters of Faith, with which Reason has directly, nothing to do.\n(Locke 1690: IV. xviii. 7. [1975: 694]) \n\n\nThe Deists tend to hold a more radical view than the one that Locke\nadvocates.\n\nSamuel Clarke in his Boyle lectures of 1704 distinguishes four grades\nof deists. First there were those who acknowledged a future life and\nother doctrines of natural religion. Second were those who while\ndenying a future life, admitted the moral role of the deity. Third are\nthose who acknowledged providence in natural religion, but not in\nmorality. And finally, those who denied providence altogether. Where\ndoes Collins fit, in these grades of deism? According to\nO\u2019Higgins: \n\n\nIn his books, Collins came to emphasize the part that morality should\nplay in religion and to assert the importance of natural religion.\n(O\u2019Higgins 1970: 40) \n\n\nCollins claims to believe in a future life (if not natural\nimmortality). Collins rejects Revelation. So, if O\u2019Higgins is\nright, Collins fits Clarke\u2019s first grade of deists.\n\nDavid Berman has disputed this view, arguing that Collins is, in fact,\nan atheist (Berman 1988: 801). Jacopo Agnesina in his book The\nPhilosophy of Anthony Collins: Free Thought and Atheism strongly\nagrees with Berman. Agnesina\u2019s strategy is to take the whole of\nCollins\u2019 work and by putting the pieces together makes clear\nwhat the parts only partially display\u2014Collins atheism (Agnesina\n2018: 192).\n",
