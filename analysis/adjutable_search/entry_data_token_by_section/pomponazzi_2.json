    "main_text": "Psychology\n3. Psychology\n\nPomponazzi\u2019s most complete discussion of the human soul was\npublished in his 1516 On the Immortality of the Soul. The\nwork builds on earlier discussions found in quaestiones\ndelivered in 1503 and 1504 (Pomponazzi 2018; Poppi 1970: 27\u201392;\nKristeller 1944) and in lectures on De anima given in\n1514\u201315 (Bakker 2007). In On the Immortality of the\nSoul, he sought to establish whether the human intellect is\nseparable and immortal using a methodology that did not exceed\n\u201cnatural limits\u201d, that is, without supposing\n\u201csomething from faith or revelation\u201d and to determine what\nis \u201cin conformity with the words of Aristotle\u201d (ch. 8). He\ncautioned that he did not affirm anything contrary to Thomas\nAquinas\u2019s views but his critiques advance \u201cin the way of\ndoubt and not of assertion\u201d (ch. 8). Moreover, he tempered his\nconsiderations by declaring his preference for scripture over\n\u201chuman reasoning and experience\u201d (ch. 8).\n\nIn what manner the human intellect is separable was a frequently\ndebated question in Renaissance discussions of the soul. Many of\nPomponazzi\u2019s contemporaries adopted Averroes\u2019 solution\nthat the possible or material intellect must be one in number and thus\nshared by all humans. Pomponazzi rejected Averroes\u2019 view,\ndeeming it \u201cmost false, unintelligible, monstrous, and quite\nforeign to Aristotle\u201d (ch. 4). After rejecting Averroes\u2019\nunicity thesis, Pomponazzi maintained that the most probable arguments\naccording to natural philosophy and Aristotle\u2019s view are\ncontrary to Thomas\u2019s position that the individual human\nintellect is immortal, separable, and unqualifiedly immaterial.\n\nA central premise for Pomponazzi\u2019s psychology is that the entire\nhuman soul falls under the study of natural philosophy. The human soul\nhas three powers\u2014vegetative, sensitive, rational\u2014but is\nunified; these powers do not have distinct substantial forms (see\nCasini 2007). Pomponazzi generally referred not to the intellect but\nrather to the intellective soul, meaning the rational power of the\nhuman soul (Sellars 2016). This intellective soul, or rational soul,\nrests midway between the eternal and perishable (ch. 1; see Bakker\n2007: 165\u201367). Accordingly, he emphasized the relation between\nthe intellectual soul and the sensitive soul, citing Aristotle\u2019s\nstatement that \u201cthe soul does not know at all without some\nphantasm (phantasma)\u201d (De anima 3.7\n431a16\u201317). The intellectual soul\u2019s dependence on these\nphantasms\u2014images that the imagination creates based on what has\nbeen sensed\u2014is confirmed for Pomponazzi not just by\nAristotle\u2019s authority but also by our own experience and by\nexperiences with those who have suffered injuries to the relevant\norgans. Since the sensitive soul resides within a material organ and\nsensation occurs in time, it is dependent on matter both with respect\nto subject (i.e., the sense organ) and object (i.e., the sensible).\nThe human intellectual or rational soul, however, is dependent on\nmatter for its object (i.e., the phantasms) but is only immaterial\nwith respect to its subject (i.e., cognition) (see Brenet 2009).\n\nBecause the human intellectual soul depends on the operations of the\nsensitive soul, which are part of a material and perishable body, it\ncannot function after the body has been destroyed. Accordingly, in\nPomponazzi\u2019s view, the human intellectual soul is immortal only\nin a relative or qualified sense. Because the act of understanding\ndoes not require a material organ as subject, the human intellectual\nsoul is more immortal than the sensitive soul or the souls of animals.\nThe human soul partakes in the immortal through its limited knowledge\nof the forms of species, without being immortal in itself. Yet because\nit cannot function without the sensitive soul, it is lower than\nGod\u2019s intelligence and than the intelligences that move the\ncelestial spheres, which are separated substances. Moreover, the human\nsoul differs from these separated intelligences in that it is the\nactualization of a body while the intelligences merely actuate, that\nis, set in motion, the celestial spheres without receiving anything\nfrom the matter of the orb. The human\u2019s soul dependency on\nmatter means that human cognition is less abstracted than that of the\nintelligences, which know through intuition not sensation.\nAccordingly, the human soul cannot know universals unqualifiedly but\nonly in relation to singulars. Thereby, the human rational soul, with\nits functioning tied to material objects, sits midway between the\nmaterial and the immaterial and between the eternal and the\nperishable; and human knowledge, while partaking in the knowledge of\nuniversals, possesses it in limited manner (ch. 8).\n\nWhile most scholarship has emphasized Pomponazzi\u2019s argument\nrelated to the connection between the intellectual and sensitive soul,\nhe put forth several other arguments based on Aristotelian principles\nagainst the immortality of individual human souls. He argued that if\nthe human soul survives the death of the body at that point it must be\nan individual indivisible substance that is either in some place or\nnowhere. If it is somewhere, it must have arrived there through\nlocomotion, yet Aristotle denies that indivisibles can move in space.\nIf it is nowhere, then Aristotle could have posited intelligences that\ndo not move the spheres and potentially there could exist an infinite\nnumber of intelligences, which in turn is prohibited by\nAristotle\u2019s arguments against the realization of an infinite\nmultitude. Similarly, he argued that if human souls are immortal and\nindividual, given that the world and its species are eternal according\nto Aristotle, the number of human souls must be infinite or souls must\ntransmigrate, both propositions that Aristotle rejected. Additionally,\nPomponazzi dismissed Thomas Aquinas\u2019s view that God creates each\nhuman soul placed within the body as being an explanation unacceptable\nto natural philosophy because Aristotle held that according to natural\nphilosophy the soul is not created but rather generated \u201cby the\nsun and man\u201d (Physics 2.2. 194b13) and everything that\nis generated perishes (ch. 8).\n\nGiven the importance of the immortality of the soul to Catholic\ndoctrine, Pomponazzi considered the ramifications of the soul\u2019s\nmortality to ethics and the possibility of human happiness and\nblessedness (see Cuttini 2012). He countered the argument that\nimmortality of the soul is necessary for a happy end achieved by\nperfecting the intellect by contending that achieving such\nintellectual perfection is only possible for someone with superior\nintellectual ability and of sound health, who has withdrawn from\nworldly affairs. Yet, such individuals are extremely\nrare\u2014\u201ceven in long centuries, barely one is\nfound\u201d\u2014and the human race and its societies do not permit\nall humans to devote themselves to philosophy (ch. 13). To the\npotential objection that belief in the mortality of the soul\nencourages immoral acts since some persons would choose to commit\ncrimes because there would be no punishment or rewards after death,\nPomponazzi responded that there are sufficient motivations for\nvirtue without considerations of the afterlife. In his view, the\nessential reward of virtue is virtue itself, which is\nhumankind\u2019s greatest good and brings security and peace of mind.\nAccordingly, the religious teachings of immortality are not true\naccording to the principles of natural philosophy but were introduced\nin order to persuade those incapable of understanding philosophy to\nbehave in a moral fashion, thereby allowing society to function (ch.\n14).\n\nKeeping with his earlier statements that his arguments were probable\nand according to natural principles, Pomponazzi concluded that the\nquestion of the immortality of the soul is a neutral problem, meaning\nthat there are no arguments based only on nature that prove either\nimmortality or mortality. His application of the term \u201cneutral\nproblem\u201d was not novel. John Duns Scotus had come to the same\nconclusion about the immortality of the soul, and Thomas Aquinas\nregarded the question of the eternity of the world as a neutral\nproblem. Consequently, faith is the ultimate arbiter of the question,\nand Pomponazzi maintained that Christians must follow the doctrine of\nimmortality that has been established by the Church fathers and Pope\nGregory I, who were the greatest experts in divine matters (ch.\n15).\n\nOn the Immortality of the Soul provoked numerous polemics, in\nwhich Pomponazzi defended his views. In 1518, he published\nApologia (Apology). The first book\nof Apology responds to the objections made by his former\nstudent Gaspare Contarini, and the second book answers critiques made\nby other philosophers and theologians. These books address questions\nabout free-will and wondrous phenomena, which were later discussed in\ngreater depth in On Incantations. The third and final book\nrecounts Pomponazzi\u2019s reactions to Ambrogio Flandino\u2019s\nhostile preaching and to public uproar in Venice. Pomponazzi asserted\nhis innocence from these charges, while proclaiming his belief in the\nimmortality of the soul, emphasizing that his book only concluded that\nAristotle held the soul to be mortal (3.1.3). He argued that\ntheologians from Augustine to Duns Scotus maintained that the soul is\nmortal according to Aristotle and therefore sustaining such a position\nshould not be considered heretical (3.3.4).  In fact, Tommaso de Vio\n(Gaetano), a former general of the Domincan order, who at the time was\na cardinal and close to Leo X, had recently cast doubt over whether\nthe immortality of the soul is demonstrable according to Aristotle\n(Gilson 1963: 173\u201383). Furthermore, Pomponazzi maintained that\nhe could not be considered a heretic because the definition of heresy\nentails adhering firmly to one\u2019s own opinion, but he had never\nreceived warnings from ecclesiastical authorities and therefore could\nnot have adhered firmly to anything contrary to the Catholic\nChurch\u2019s teachings (3.3.1\u20132). In 1519, Pomponazzi\npublished Defensorium (Defense) in reply to Agostino\nNifo\u2019s lengthy attack that argued that intellection is possible\nwithout phantasms (de Boer 2018: 19\u201325). The Defense\nwas printed together with Giovanni Crisostomo Javelli\u2019s response\nthat offered theological and Platonic counterpoints to\nPomponazzi\u2019s views. The theologians Ambrogio Flandino and\nBartolomeo Spina also published attacks on Pomponazzi\u2019s\ntreatment of the soul (see Blum 2007: 223\u201327).\n",
