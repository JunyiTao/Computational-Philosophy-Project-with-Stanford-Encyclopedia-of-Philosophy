    "main_text": "Hui Shi || The Ten Theses\n5.1 The Ten Theses\n\nOur only detailed information about Hui Shi\u2019s doctrines comes\nfrom two sources: the seven statements attributed jointly to him and\n Deng Xi\n in the Xunzi (3.1), which we looked at briefly above, and\nthe \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d essay, which attributes ten theses to\nhim, some paradoxical. \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d was probably written\nlong after Hui Shi\u2019s death, and only one of its ten theses\nappears in the much earlier Xunzi list. Hence we cannot be\nsure the ten theses were indeed Hui Shi\u2019s; some or all may have\nbeen the work of anonymous followers who adopted him as their\nfigurehead. Fortunately, this historical issue is irrelevant to their\nphilosophical interest. Either way, the theses are intriguing ideas\nformulated by one or more Chinese thinkers probably sometime during\nthe late 4th or the 3rd century B.C.E. The arguments for the theses\nhave been lost, and as a result some are extremely obscure. But others\nare reasonably clear or at least open to educated conjecture. \n\nThe ten theses revolve around the theme that distinctions are not\ninherently fixed, but relative to a perspective, and thus can be\nredrawn or collapsed as we like simply by shifting perspectives.\nSeveral of the paradoxes focus on negating commonsense distinctions,\nin particular spatial and temporal ones, partly by appeal to the\nrelativity of comparisons and partly by appeal to indexicals (Hansen\n1992: 262). (A high mountain is not high when seen from space; if I\nwalk southward, a spot that is south of me now will in seconds be\nnorth of me.) The fifth thesis, on \u201cthe same\u201d and\n\u201cdifferent,\u201d seems to provide a key to several, perhaps\nall of the others. It indicates that on some scale or another,\nanything can be deemed \u201cthe same\u201d or\n\u201cdifferent.\u201d \n\nThe theses are presented in \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d as follows:\n\nHui Shi had many directions (fang, also\n\u201cmethods\u201d). His books filled five carts; his dao\n(way) was contrary; his sayings did not hit the mark. Intending to\ntabulate things, he said:\n\n\nThe ultimately great has no outside, call it the Great One. The\nultimately small has no inside, call it the Small One.\nThe dimensionless cannot be accumulated, its size is a thousand\nmiles.\nHeaven is as low as earth, mountains are level with marshes. \nJust as the sun is at noon, it is declining. Just as things are\nalive, they are dying.\nThe same on a large scale but different from what is the same on a\nsmall scale, this is called \u201csame and different on a small\nscale.\u201d The myriad things all being the same or all being\ndifferent, this is called \u201csame and different on a large\nscale.\u201d \nThe south has no limit yet has a limit.\nToday go to Yue but arrive yesterday. \nLinked rings can be disconnected.\nI know the center of the world. It is north of Yan [the\nnorthernmost state] and south of Yue [the southernmost].\nUniversally care for the myriad things. Heaven and earth are one\nunit.\n\n\nHui Shi took these to be of great significance. He displayed them to\nthe world to let the disputers know of them, and the disputers of the\nworld enjoyed them with him.\n\n\nIt is unclear whether the order of the sequence is deliberate, but\nthis seems unlikely, since the temporal paradoxes are not placed\ntogether, and it is hard to see how thesis 8, about the rings, fits\ninto a deliberate, argumentative sequence. On the other hand, the last\nthesis, the only one with ethical import, reads like a grand\nconclusion and so probably belongs in the final position. The first\nforms a natural opening, with the \u201cGreat One\u201d portending\nthe \u201cone unit\u201d of the tenth, and the second may about one\nof the notions introduced in the first, the \u201cSmall One\u201d or\ninfinitesimal. The fifth is among the clearest and is probably the\nbasis for several of the others. Some scholars have suggested that the\nlist breaks into two parts, with the fifth thesis summarizing the\nfirst half, but this interpretation seems forced. The first, fifth,\nand tenth are of course neither paradoxes nor sophistries, but\nrelatively straightforward philosophical theses. Thesis 3 is a variant\nof the first two paradoxes attributed to Hui Shi and Deng Xi in\nXunzi (3.1), listed above in the section on\n Deng Xi.\n With those two exceptions, the paradoxes attributed to Hui Shi here\nare considerably more interesting philosophically than those Xunzi\nmentions. \n\nThe theses are obscure enough that, especially without knowing Hui\nShi\u2019s original arguments, any close interpretation must be\npartly speculative. Different readers are bound to arrive at different\nconclusions. With the possible exception of theses 1, 5, and 10, there\nis simply not enough contextual information to offer an authoritative\nargument for any interpretation, though at least some readings can be\nruled out for failing to cohere with any recognized issues or theories\nin early Chinese philosophical discourse. Here we will offer a\ntentative explanation of each thesis grounded in the philosophical\ncontext sketched in\n \u201cBackground and Overview\u201d\n above.[11] The theses divide fairly naturally\ninto four groups, which we will discuss one by one.\nGroup 1: Basic Principles\n\nThe first group comprises theses 1, 5, and 10, which state\nphilosophical doctrines about ontology and ethics, not paradoxes, and\nwhich are relatively easy to understand. All three deal with the\nplurality of possible ways to distinguish things, either as \u201cthe\nsame\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d or as parts of a whole, ranging\nfrom the smallest possible part\u2014the infinitesimal\u2014to the\nlargest possible whole, the \u201cGreat One,\u201d which includes\neverything in the cosmos. How we distinguish things is relative to the\nscale or perspective we adopt. Thesis 5 is slightly obscure, but it\nseems to describe the relative or perspectival nature of relations of\nsimilarity and difference. Two things can be the same on a large\nscale, or in some general respect, while at the same time being\ndifferent on a smaller scale, or in some more specific respect. For\nexample, two animals can be the same in being of the kind\nhorse, yet be different in color. Anything can be similar or\ndifferent on some scale or other. If we distinguish finely, every\nindividual horse is different, while if we distinguish coarsely,\nhorses are no different from other animals, or even from all other\nthings. There seems to be an unlimited range of levels on which we can\ndistinguish relations of sameness and difference, including deeming\nevery individual different or the myriad kinds of things the same.\n\n\nBecause the same/different relation comprises both kind relations and\npart-whole relations, Thesis 5 can also be taken to include part-whole\nrelations. Deeming all things \u201cthe same\u201d is deeming them\nall parts of the same whole. Deeming them \u201cdifferent\u201d can\nbe understood as separating them off as individual parts of that\nwhole. To the extent that the other theses are based on relations of\nsameness versus difference and part versus whole, then, thesis 5 may\nexplain them all. \n\nThesis 1 is nearly self-explanatory. How we distinguish\nthings\u2014in this case, how we even count \u201c1\u201d\u2014is\nrelative to some standard of division. The thesis concerns summing and\ndividing. The whole cosmos can be summed into a whole to form the\nGreat One. Or it can be divided down to the smallest possible unit,\nthe Small One, probably a geometric point. \n\nThesis 10 presents an ethical principle tied together with an\nontological one, which presumably is meant to justify it. Since\neverything can be summed into a whole\u2014the Great One\u2014heaven\nand earth and the myriad things contained therein can be considered a\nsingle \u201cbody\u201d or\n \u201cunit.\u201d[12]\n (In classical texts, the expression \u2018heaven and earth\u2019\nrefers to the cosmos, including not only the sky and earth but the\nentire natural world.) The ethical principle follows intuitively. If\neverything is one unit, then any care (ai, also\n\u201clove\u201d) we have for ourselves should also be directed at\nall of the other myriad things (wu, \u201cthings,\u201d or,\nperhaps more specifically, \u201ccreatures\u201d), since\nfundamentally we are all parts of the same vast \u201cunit\u201d or\n\u201cbody.\u201d This ethical stance takes the ideal of\nimpartiality even farther than the Mohists. Their position is that we\nmust care inclusively for every person in the world. Thesis 10\nadvocates caring for every thing as well. \nGroup 2: Infinitesimals and Part-whole\n\nThe second group concerns infinitesimals and part-whole relations.\nLike all seven of the remaining theses, these are paradoxes. Thesis 2\nis fairly clear. Geometrical points are dimensionless. The sum of two\npoints is still a point; hence points cannot be added one to another\nto form an object with thickness or length. Yet anything with\ndimensions is somehow constituted by points and divisible into\n them.[13]\n\nIn this group we can also include thesis 8, though with much less\nconfidence, as it is the most obscure of the ten. We will tentatively\nsuppose\u2014following Harbsmeier (1998: 296) and Graham (1989:\n79)\u2014that this thesis too is based on infinitesimals. The paradox\nmight then be explained in one of two ways. First, if the linked rings\nare thought of as circles, formed by points on a plane, then they have\nno thickness. They appear linked when viewed from above, but on the\nsurface of the plane nothing blocks them from being pulled apart. The\nsecond explanation extends the same idea to three dimensions. If, as\nthesis 2 suggests, two three-dimensional rings are constituted by\ndimensionless points, then they can be pulled apart: since each point\ntakes up no space, there is nothing preventing the rings from passing\nthrough each other. These interpretations are highly speculative,\nhowever. Without further contextual information, even if this sort of\nexplanation makes sense of the paradox, we have no particular reason\nto believe it is correct. \nGroup 3: Spatial Relations\n\nThe third group are based on spatial relations, including comparisons\nof size. Thesis 3, the only one also attributed to Hui Shi in the\nXunzi, can be taken to illustrate the idea that things deemed\ndifferent on one scale can be deemed the same on another. By some\nperspective or standard, such as that of the infinitely vast Great\nOne, the difference between the height of the sky and the earth or\nmountains and marshes may be insignificant. From that perspective, the\ndifferences between mountains and marshes may be only what thesis 5\ncalls \u201cdifferences on a small scale,\u201d while the two count\nas \u201cthe same\u201d on a large scale. Thesis 6 is especially\nobscure. Thematically, we can point out that like several of the other\ntheses, it attempts to collapse a distinction, in this case between\nthe finite and infinite. As Hansen (1992: 262) points out, thesis 6,\nalong with 7 and 9, all focus on indexicals. Since the referents of\nindexicals shift from context to context, they are a vivid example of\nthe fluidity of the language-world relation and the distinction\nbetween \u201cthis\u201d (shi) and \u201cnot\u201d\n(fei). This suggests at least two ways to understand the\nthesis, both too speculative to be considered justified, but perhaps\nat least roughly indicative of its point. One is that if a particular\ndirection is to be south, it must have a limit, or else the\nfour directions all merge into one and south is no longer south, since\nit is not distinguished from the other three. Another possibility is\nthat since the directions of the compass are all indexical, relative\nto our point of reference, south always has a limit: the point at\nwhich we stand. \n\nThesis 9 is another of those involving indexicals, in this case\n\u201ccenter,\u201d and is also very obscure. The thesis claims that\nthe center of the world is north of the northernmost state and south\nof the southernmost. Possibly the thesis is a variant of thesis 3,\nthat the sky is as low as the earth. The point there was that from the\nperspective of the infinitely vast whole, the difference between the\nheight of the sky and earth may be insignificant. Thesis 9 could be\nmaking the analogous point that the distance between Yan and Yue is\ninsignificant. Another possibility is that if space is infinitely\nlarge, then every standpoint can count as the center (Graham 1989: 79,\nafter the 3rd-century Sima Biao). Possibly this thesis is a variant of\nthe same idea as the third thesis in the Xunzi list, which\nwas that the far west and far east are \u201cadjacent.\u201d \nGroup 4: Temporal Relations\n\nThe fourth group deal with temporal relations. Thesis 4 is paradoxical\nbut easily intelligible. Just as from one perspective the sun is at\nits highest, from another perspective it is beginning to set. Just as\nthings are living and growing, they are also coming closer to death.\nAgain, the plurality of perspectives threatens to collapse the\ndistinction between two apparent opposites, living and dying. In\ncomparison with thesis 4, thesis 7 is extremely obscure. Clearly, it\nattempts to collapse the difference between today and yesterday or\npresent and past. Interestingly, this paradox combines spatial and\ntemporal relations, since in addition to the distinction between today\nand yesterday, there is the spatial movement from here to Yue (a state\nin the south). Hence Harbsmeier (298) and Graham (79) both propose to\ninterpret the paradox in terms of the infinite divisibility of space\nand time, suggesting that if I cross the border into Yue precisely at\nthe instant when today turns into tomorrow, the result is that I am\nsimultaneously leaving one state today and arriving in the other\ntomorrow. Another possibility is to point out that xi, the\nword rendered \u201cyesterday,\u201d is also commonly used to mean\nsimply \u201cthe past\u201d or \u201cpreviously.\u201d So thesis 7\ncan be restated, \u201cToday I go to Yue, but I arrive in the\npast.\u201d The import of the paradox could be that all\n\u201carriving\u201d is always in the past: whenever we arrive\nsomewhere, our journey is completed, or \u201cpast.\u201d \nGeneral Theme\n\nAre the ten theses merely a loose collection, or are they intended to\nsupport a particular conclusion? Clearly, several of them can be taken\nto follow from thesis 5, about the relativity of sameness and\ndifference. Thesis 5 can thus be treated as a premise or guiding\nprinciple and might be the main theme. Another possibility is that the\nten are intended to culminate in the final thesis, the only one with\nmoral import, which is not relativistic. It states that heaven and\nearth\u2014all of the natural world\u2014form a monistic unit, and\nso our moral caring should extend to all things. The question of the\noverall significance of the set in effect boils down to the question\nof whether, given the overall context, thesis 10 has a privileged\nstatus over thesis 5 and the others. From Hu Shih (1922) on, many\ninterpreters have suggested it\n does.[14]\n Clearly, the textual evidence is so sparse that there is no question\nof deciding the issue conclusively. However, there are at least three\ngood reasons for favoring the monistic interpretation. First, the\nplacement of thesis 10 at the end makes it natural to read it as the\nconclusion or main theme. Second, not only is thesis 10 placed last,\nit is the only thesis with ethical significance. A plausible\nexplanation is that whoever arranged the ten theses saw the ethical\nview as emerging out of the others. Third, and most important, unlike\ntheses 1 and 5, thesis 10 seems to make an absolutist claim. If it\nwere parallel to theses 1 and 5, we might expect it to present a\nperspectival claim, such as that heaven and earth are in one respect\none body and in another respect many. But instead it simply asserts\nthat they are one.\n\nTentatively adopting the monistic interpretation, then, we can\nreconstruct the basic \u201cHui Shi view\u201d roughly as\nfollows:\n\nThe relations of sameness and difference that underlie all use of\nlanguage can be redrawn in indefinitely many ways, all of which may be\njustified relative to one standard or another. \nSo no single way of drawing distinctions is fixed by nature\nitself.\nHence the world in itself draws no distinctions at all.\nDistinctions are established by human convention, in which we\nestablish norms for distinguishing the same and different one way or\nanother. Apart from these norms, there are no absolute, privileged\nnatural kinds or distinctions. \nTherefore, in itself, all of nature forms a single whole. (And as\nparts of this whole, we should care for all things.)\n\n\nSeveral comments about this view are in order. First, the thrust of\nthe view is not that distinctions are \u201cunreal,\u201d in the\nsense of being illusory, false, or merely an aspect of appearance, not\nunderlying reality. It is just the opposite: countless different\nschemes of distinctions are all real, with the result that\nnone are privileged. Since no scheme is privileged, the\n\u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cdefault\u201d view\u2014that of the\nworld in itself\u2014is monistic, drawing no distinctions at all. On\nthe other hand, another way of understanding \u201creal\u201d is as\nmeaning \u201cfixed by nature itself.\u201d If we take\n\u201creal\u201d this way, we can agree with Hansen (262) that the\nHui Shi position adopts a \u201cnon-realist\u201d attitude toward\ndistinctions: it holds that no single scheme of distinctions is fixed\nby the world. However, if the monistic interpretation is correct, then\nthe Hui Shi position is realist in this sense with respect to\nthe \u201cone unit\u201d or \u201cGreat One,\u201d the \u201cnull\nscheme\u201d consisting of the absence of any distinctions. That\nscheme is fixed by nature itself. \n\nSecond, the Hui Shi view does not hold that, as Graham proposes,\n\u201cSince division leads to contradiction don\u2019t divide at\nall\u201d (1989: 79). Far from regarding contradictions as a problem,\nit embraces them. It explains them by appeal to constantly shifting\nperspectives or standards for distinguishing same and different. \n\nSince Hui Shi\u2019s monism might recall that of the Eleatics (cf. Hu\n1922, Graham 1989), it is worth clarifying the similarities and\ndifferences between the two. The similarities are superficial: both\ndevelop a form of absolute monism grounded in reflection about\nlanguage or thought and its relation to reality. But the arguments for\nand consequences of the two views are fundamentally different. The\nstarting point for Parmenides\u2019s monism is reflection on the\nconcept of \u2018being\u2019 or \u2018the real\u2019, specifically\nthe claim that what is real must necessarily be. From this he draws\nthe conclusion that what is real must be ungenerable, imperishable,\nindivisible, and unchanging. Thus, in contrast to the eternal,\nunchanging world intelligible through reason, the inconstant, changing\nworld of everyday perceptual experience is in some sense not\n\u201creal.\u201d By contrast, the Hui Shi view starts from a kind\nof radical perspectivalism about distinctions. It argues that since no\nstandard for drawing distinctions has a privileged, absolute status,\nthe only way to draw distinctions given by reality itself is not to\ndraw any at all. Reality is not regarded as indivisible and\nunchanging, nor is the changing world of sense experience in any sense\n\u201cunreal.\u201d Rather, reality is divisible in indefinitely\nmany ways. All of the resulting distinctions are \u201creal\u201d in\nthe sense that the features of things on which they are based indeed\nexist. The distinctions are not delusory. The problem is that neither\nare they privileged or fixed: they can be replaced by alternative\nschemes of distinctions. The only privileged scheme is monism, drawing\nno distinctions at\n all.[15]\n\nIs this move from perspectivalism about distinctions to a kind of\nmonism justified? Hansen argues that it is not. His interpretation of\nthe argument is that it moves from the claim that we cannot know what\ndistinctions are ultimately real to the conclusion that no\ndistinctions are real (262). The move is via the hidden,\nverificationist premise that a distinction exists only if we can know\nthat it does. Hence Hansen suggests that the Hui Shi view is based on\na form of \u201cverification fallacy,\u201d which confuses what we\ncan know with what is real (263). \n\nHansen is probably right to hold that monism does not follow validly\nfrom Hui Shi\u2019s premises. All that follows is that no one scheme\nfor drawing distinctions can be justified absolutely: Justification\nmust always be contextual. But it seems unlikely that the text commits\nthe fallacy he describes. The ten theses do not mention epistemic\nissues. Certainly there is no explicit skeptical claim that we cannot\nknow which distinctions are ultimately real. Rather, there is only the\nsuggestion, in thesis 5, that there may be uncountably many ways of\ndrawing distinctions, set alongside a series of examples that collapse\nconventional distinctions. So, rather than committing a\nverificationist fallacy, it may be that the Hui Shi view is simply\ninconsistent. On the basis of thesis 5, Hui Shi should hold any scheme\nof distinctions may be deemed \u201cadmissible\u201d or\n\u201cinadmissible,\u201d by reference to some standard or other,\nyet no scheme is privileged, including the scheme that\nconsists in drawing no distinctions at all. Instead, if the monistic\ninterpretation is correct, he mistakenly takes the \u201cGreat\nOne\u201d or \u201cone unit\u201d view to be an exception to this\n rule.[16]\n The mistake is understandable, since drawing no distinctions at all\nmight seem to be a way of circumventing the perspectival nature of\ndistinctions. It is not, however, since strictly speaking it remains\none among other ways of drawing distinctions. \n\n\u201cUnder Heaven\u201d lists 21 more paradoxes, which \u201cthe\ndisputers used to respond to Hui Shi without end for their whole\nlives.\u201d All lack explanations, making some impenetrably obscure.\nFor interpretations of a handful of the relatively tractable ones,\nalong with speculations about a few of the others, see the following\nsupplementary document: \n\nMiscellaneous Paradoxes\n\n\nDespite their obscurity, at least some of the theses attributed to Hui\nShi and a few of the other paradoxes and sophistries collected in\n\u201cUnder Heaven\u201d probably grow out of legitimate theoretical\nissues and are of genuine philosophical interest. By contrast, when we\nturn to Gongsun Long, we encounter a disputer who may have been\ndevoted to sophistry purely for sophistry\u2019s sake. We cannot be\nsure of this, of course, but what we can say is that Gongsun Long won\nfame by advocating a claim that any competent speaker of his language\nwould have judged obviously false, namely that \u201ca white horse is\nnot a horse.\u201d \n",
