    "main_text": "In What Sense Was Hume a Newtonian? || Mathematics\n4.6 Mathematics\n\nThere has been a persistent strain of criticism of David Hume that has\ninsinuated that he simply did not understand Newton or lacked\nmathematical competence. But when Hume (or any other historical\nfigure) deviates from Newton this need not entail lack of\nunderstanding, it can, depending on other evidence, also be taken as\ninformed criticism (Schliesser 2011). In Hume\u2019s case, critical\nscholars also draw on a (1772) letter to William Strahan in which he\nmentions a 1755 draft essay \u201cOn the Metaphysical Principles of\nGeometry\u201d that he withdrew upon the advice of his friend the\nmathematician Lord Stanhope, \u201cwho convinced me that either there\nwas some defeat in the argument or in its perspicuity\u201d (Newman\n1981). This remark is taken as evidence of Hume\u2019s acknowledged\nlack of competence in mathematics. But it could also be taken at face\nvalue and an expression of scholarly integrity: he accepted a\ncompelling criticism.\n\nHowever far his understanding of complex mathematics reached, he\nadvanced a radical sceptical challenge for mathematics, and thereby he\nalso undermined knowledge claims associated with demonstrative\nreasoning (Meeker 2007). The sceptical problem arises from the\ninexactness of geometrical ideas and the fallibility of our reasoning\nprocesses. Geometry for Hume is about actual figures and shapes whose\nideas cannot be perfectly exact because our perceptual abilities are\nlimited, and reasoning based on these ideas inherits this inexactness.\nIdeas relevant for arithmetic, i.e., numbers, do not suffer from this\nimprecision, but arithmetical reasoning is just as fallible as human\nreasoning in general. The outcome of our demonstrative reasoning must\nbe judged by a probabilistic judgment on the reliability of our\nreasoning faculties, which in turn must be judged by a further\nprobabilistic judgment on the probabilistic judgment on the\nreliability of our faculties. The apparent demonstrative certainty of\nour mathematical reasoning degenerates into probability, and we are\nleft with fallible and uncertain conclusions even in our demonstrative\nsciences (THN 1.4.1.2\u20136).\n\nBut Hume does not stop there: he offers a sceptical solution to this\nchallenge (Demeter 2019a). First he offers an individual\nremedy for the mathematician: to go back and to check again his\nreasoning, because \u201c[e]very time he runs over his proofs, his\nconfidence increases\u201d (THN 1.2.4.23). Secondly, social\nprocesses are more effective in reducing doubt, because his certainty\nis increased \u201cstill more by the approbation of his friends; and\nis rais\u2019d to its utmost perfection by the universal assent and\napplauses of the learned world\u201d (THN 1.4.1.2). Even if all\ndemonstrative knowledge remains probabilistic in this approach too,\nthe certainty of mathematical reasoning reaches its peak due to the\nacknowledgment of epistemic peers.\n\nThe popularity of a mathematical proof (or demonstration) among\nexperts in the field naturally speaks in favor of the proof. This\nfeature is not peculiar to mathematical conclusions, because as Hume\npoints out: \u201cI feel all my opinions loosen and fall of\nthemselves, when unsupported by the approbation of others\u201d (THN\n1.4.7.4). What makes mathematics peculiar is that, in addition to\nindividual reasoning, the approbation of the mathematician\u2019s\nclose circle of \u201cfriends\u201d, and the approval of the\nscholarly community seem to be the only sources of\njustification in matters of mathematics.\n\nBy connecting mathematical certainty to the approbation of others Hume\ngives an essentially social character to mathematical knowledge. No\nmatter the different metaphysical and epistemic pedigree of its\nbranches, it is their practices that determine the certainty of\nmathematical conclusions (THN 2.3.10.2). In practice geometrical\nreasoning is elevated to the same level of certainty as our reasoning\nin arithmetic and algebra\u2014and his may be one way to explain why\nthe Enquiry (EHU 4.1, 7.1\u20132, 12.20) lists all of them\nas demonstrative. The limitations of our practices, arising from human\nnature, condemn all branches of mathematics to eventual fallibility\nand uncertainty. But that is not the main lesson we should draw here.\nWhat really matters is that despite this fallibility we\ngenerate certainty through our predominantly social\npractices. So geometry in practice can be as certain and\ndemonstrative as arithmetic is in principle demonstrative,\nbut in practice, fallible. Taken together, the metaphysics and\npractice of mathematics leads us to pretty much the same epistemic\ngrounds in all branches of mathematics.\n\nHume\u2019s reservations about the demonstrability of mathematics\nimply a critique of Newton\u2019s programme of mathematizing natural\nphilosophy (for details see Hazony & Schliesser 2016). This\ncriticism is not wholly implicit; rather Newton is very clearly the\ntarget of remarks made in the context of Hume\u2019s discussion of\nthe principle of \u201cinfinite divisibility\u201d in the paragraphs\nsubsequent to THN 1.2.4.17:\n\n\nwe are not possess\u2019d of any instrument or art of\nmeasuring, which can secure us from all error and uncertainty\u2026\nwe therefore suppose some imaginary standard of equality, by which the\nappearances and measuring are exactly corrected, and the figures\nreduc\u2019d entirely to that proportion\u2026 But tho\u2019 this\nstandard be only imaginary, the fiction however is very natural; nor\nis any thing more usual, than for the mind to proceed after this\nmanner with any action, even after the reason has ceas\u2019d, which\nfirst determin\u2019d it to begin. This appears very conspicuously\nwith regard to time; where tho\u2019 \u2019tis evident we have no\nexact method of determining the proportions of parts, not even so\nexact as in extension, yet the various corrections of our measures,\nand their different degrees of exactness, have given us an obscure and\nimplicit notion of a perfect and entire equality. The case is the same\nin many other subjects. A painter forms the same fiction with regard\nto colours. A mechanic with regard to motion. (THN 1.2.4.24)\n\n\nInstead of introducing certainty into natural philosophy as Newton\nclaimed, mathematics, albeit a useful device \u201cin almost every\nart and profession\u201d (THN 2.3.3.2), is thus grounded in natural\nfictions. It has a limited contribution to the advancement of\nknowledge. Mathematics in Hume\u2019s eyes is only another human\ncognitive enterprise that has no potential to make other fields of\nknowledge immune to human fallibility. This is in sharp contrast with\nthe cognitive optimism Newton expresses in the Preface to the\nPrincipia and several other passages about the role of\nmathematics in natural inquiry (see Guicciardini 2009, esp. ch. 13\n& 14; Zempl\u00e9n & Demeter 2010). Newton is confident that\nby making the method of inquiry mathematical, natural philosophy can\nbe infused with certainty and demonstrativity. This confidence is\nundermined by Hume\u2019s account of how mathematical knowledge is\npossible at all.\n",
