This was written at the end of her life and published\nanonymously in Amsterdam in 1690 in a Latin translation with the\ntitle, Principia philosophiae antiquissimae et recentissimae.\nIt was translated back into English and printed in London in 1692 as\nThe Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy. The\nother source for her philosophical activities is her correspondence\nwith Henry More.\n\nAnne Conway\u2019s treatise is a work of Platonist metaphysics in which she\nderives her system of philosophy from the existence and attributes of\nGod. The framework of Conway\u2019s system is a tripartite ontological\nhierarchy of \u201cspecies\u201d, the highest of which is God, the\nsource of all being. Christ, or \u201cmiddle nature\u201d, links God\nand the third species, called \u201cCreature\u201d. God as the most\nperfect being is infinitely good, wise, and just. A principle of\nlikeness links God and creation. Since God is good and just, his\ncreation too is good and just. Created substance, like God, consists\nof spirit, but, unlike God, is constituted of infinite multiples of\nspirit particles, which, as unities in multiplicity, may be described\nas monadic (though not in a Leibnizian sense). All created substance\nis living, capable of motion and perception. Anne Conway denies the\nexistence of material body as such, arguing that inert corporeal\nsubstance would contradict the nature of God, who is life itself.\nIncorporeal created substance is, however, differentiated from the\ndivine, principally on account of its mutability and multiplicity even\nso, the infinite number and constant mutability of created things\nconstitutes an obverse reflection of the unity, infinity, eternity and\nunchangeableness of God. The continuum between God and creatures is\nmade possible through \u201cmiddle nature\u201d, an intermediary\nbeing, through which God communicates life, action, goodness and\njustice. \u201cMiddle nature\u201d, partakes of the nature of both\nGod and creation, and is therefore both a bridge and a buffer between\nGod and created things. Thus, although she conceives of created\nsubstance as a continuum, and understands mutability as capacity for\nincreased perfection, she sought to avoid the charge of pantheism. The\nspiritual perfectionism of Anne Conway\u2019s system has a dual aspect:\nmetaphysical and moral. On the one hand all things are capable of\nbecoming more spirit-like, that is, more refined qua spiritual\nsubstance. At the same time, all things are capable of increased\ngoodness. She explains evil as a falling away from the perfection of\nGod, and understands suffering as part of a longer term process of\nspiritual recovery. She denies the eternity of hell, since for God to\npunish finite wrong-doing with infinite and eternal hell punishment\nwould be manifestly unjust and therefore a contradiction of the divine\nnature. Instead she explains pain and suffering as purgative, with the\nultimate aim of restoring creatures to moral and metaphysical\nperfection. Anne Conway\u2019s system is thus not just an ontology and but\na theodicy.\n",
