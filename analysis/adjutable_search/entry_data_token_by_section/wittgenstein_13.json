    "main_text": "The Middle Wittgenstein\n4. The Middle Wittgenstein\n\nIt is noteworthy that the conventional conceptualization of two\nWittgensteins, originally thought to be clearly demarcated between the\nearly and later Wittgensteins, has been repeatedly re-worked in the\nensuing interpretative project of understanding the\nphilosopher\u2019s writings, thoughts, and ideas, with no show of\nsubsiding. One of the natural outcomes of such intense investigation\nis the awareness that, indeed, understanding Wittgenstein means\nrecognizing other times and other developments, such as before the\nearly Wittgenstein (of the Tractatus), between the early\nWittgenstein and the later Wittgenstein (of Philosophical\nInvestigations), and following that later Wittgenstein.\n\nThe middle Wittgenstein, he of the period between the early\nWittgenstein and the later Wittgenstein, was, early on, identified as\nworthy of exposure and more interpretative work, but such a venture\nwas clearly a function of two mutually impactful grand questions: What\nis the relationship between the early and later Wittgenstein (as\nadumbrated in 2.4 and 3.8) and, following upon answers to that\nquestion, what is then the more exact time-frame that is worthy of the\nindependent label \u201cmiddle\u201d? Thus, there is presently much\nmore work being done on the middle Wittgenstein as the questions of\nthe relationship between the early and the later Wittgenstein have\ntaken center-stage and become a constant in Wittgenstein\nscholarship.\n\nHow, then, to best demarcate the middle Wittgenstein? The wide date\nrecognition, all along from 1929 (or even earlier) to 1944 (the time\nwhen Wittgenstein began the final revision of PI) might seem\ntoo obvious, though it can house readings of the\ncontinuity-between-early-and-later-Wittgenstein school persuasively.\nSuch is work by, for instance, Joachim Schulte (1992), who notes a\nmiddle Wittgenstein already in the TLP leading all the way to\nlater Wittgenstein\u2019s key treatments of grammar or mathematics.\nThe opposite extreme, of pinpointing one point in time as expressing a\nsole significant transformation, seems too summary. This strategy is\nadopted, for example, by the Hintikkas (1986b) regarding the year 1929\nor by Kienzler (1997) concerning a transitional break in 1931. Then\nthere are the various more moderate determinations, which adopt a\ntime-span of a few years, usually sometime between 1929 and 1935,\nexplaining their delineations by philosophical interpretations of the\ntexts and contexts of those times. Such are: O. K. Bouwsma (1961), who\npoints to the period of the Blue and Brown Books (1933\u201335);\nP. M. S. Hacker (1986), who follows a two year period \u2013\n1929\u20131930 \u2013 as the middle Wittgenstein \u201cbridge\u201d;\nAlois Pichler (2004), who recognizes a middle Wittgenstein in\n1930\u20131935 based on Wittgensteinian styles; or David Stern (1991), who\nbriefly gives the demarcation of \u201cthe late 1920s and early\n1930s.\u201d\n\nIf we adopt that last marker of dates, the late 1920s to the early (or\nmid-)1930s, we can address, in general, the objects of interpretation\nthat have provided the basis for a middle Wittgenstein. Although\neverything in the Nachlass is now digitally available to the\naspiring interpreter, the published versions of\ntypescripts/manuscripts of talks and notes (sometimes dictated to\nstudents) have been the evidence upon which middle Wittgenstein\ninterpretation has flourished. These are (in chronological order of\ntheir occurrence, not their publication) \u201cSome Remarks on\nLogical Form\u201d (1929), \u201cA Lecture on Ethics\u201d (1929),\nPhilosophical Remarks (1929\u20131930), Philosophical\nGrammar (1932\u201333), The Big Typescript\n(1932\u20131933); the Blue and Brown Books\n(1933\u20131935), and \u201cNotes for Lectures on \u2018Private\nExperience\u2019 and \u2018Sense Data\u2019\u201d\n(1935\u201336). Just as illuminating, even tantalizing, are the\npublications of notes taken by participants in Wittgenstein\u2019s\nclasses in those philosophically eventful years, since it was in those\nsurroundings that Wittgenstein was working out \u2013 live \u2013\nthe deliberations and moves into what would become the later\nWittgenstein. Supplied by Alice Ambrose, Desmond Lee, G. E. Moore,\nRush Rhees, and Friedrich Waismann (on Wittgenstein\u2019s\nconversations with members of the Vienna Circle), these are volumes\nreplete with questions of philosophy, meta-philosophy, method, and\nstyle that provide the Wittgensteinian interpreter with voluminous raw\ndata in order to characterize a middle Wittgenstein.\n\nThe themes that populate the texts above are wide and varied. Some\nharken back to Tractarian refrains, more appear to introduce later\nWittgensteinian terms; a number of subjects make transitory\nappearances, never to return. Phenomenology, for one, is a constant\nWittgensteinian concern, mostly for interpreters of all Wittgensteins\nwho bicker over the very ascription of phenomenology to\nWittgenstein\u2019s thought, accompanied by their attempt to define\nWittgenstein\u2019s use of the term. But it is in the middle\nWittgenstein that phenomenology makes a literal appearance,\nspecifically in the \u201cPhenomenology is Grammar\u201d chapter of\nThe Big Typescript. The questions then become whether\nphenomenology can be ascribed to the early Wittgenstein, whether it\nwas really only adopted in the later Wittgenstein, and most relevant\nhere \u2013 whether it can be identified as either vacating the scene\nin the middle Wittgenstein or, contrarily, there becoming\nterminologically and therefore significantly present. There is also\nthe option that phenomenology appears exclusively in the middle\nWittgenstein. These last options may then be seen as (at least partly)\ndefinitive of a middle period.\n\nMathematics, and Wittgenstein\u2019s original thoughts on it, can\nundoubtedly be seen as another investigative anchor of middle\nWittgenstein. Although it is clear that mathematics was of great\ninterest to him in TLP, his thoughts on it became more\nenigmatic precisely in the middle period. Several \u201cisms\u201d\nare attributed to his view(s) on mathematics here \u2013\nverificationism, formalism, and finitism, along with recognition of a\n\u201ccalculus conception\u201d of mathematics. (Intuitionism, a\nfavorite label for interpreters of Wittgenstein\u2019s mathematics,\nis only identified in the Remarks on the Foundations of\nMathematics (1937\u20131944) and after, i.e., in the later\nWittgenstein.) It appears, however, that middle Wittgenstein\u2019s\ndealings with mathematics in this period are, as claimed by Juliet\nFloyd (2005), constantly changing \u2013 and even that, not in any\nconsistent developmental way but in \u201cpiecemeal and uneven\u201d\nfashion. Indeed, along with written evidence of Wittgenstein's\ninfluence on and by mathematicians, we can identify the work on\nmathematics done particularly by the later Wittgenstein and even he of\nthe post-Investigations period, as a substantial overturning\nof his early and middle conceptions of mathematics.\n\nWhile phenomenology and mathematics stand out as almost quirky (and\nperhaps suspiciously unclear) subjects making their idiosyncratic\nappearance in the middle Wittgenstein, the more evident\nWittgensteinian constructs of this period are, of course, logic,\nlanguage, and method. Unsurprisingly, \u201cSome Remarks on Logical\nForm\u201d in 1929 heralds the transition from early to later\nWittgenstein, moving from (ideal, formal) logic to (the rules of use\nof) grammar. Language is also viewed as the connecting factor between\nthe early and later Wittgenstein, either by discovering still\n\u201crepresentational\u201d aspects in descriptions of its use or\nby deciphering roots of the private language arguments in this\nWittgenstein\u2019s musings. Other times, analysis of linguistic\nphenomena as language games rather than tools of logic provides what\nwe have always acknowledged as paradigmatic transitions from early to\nlater Wittgenstein. These all involve methodology \u2013 Wittgenstein\nespousing a method of doing philosophy that is different from that of\nTLP, but still not the plurality of methods proposed in\nPI. Furthermore, the method proposed is the turn to grammar\nas a back turning on dogmatism (and/of metaphysics). David Stern calls\nthe early Wittgenstein\u2019s views on logic, language, and method\n\u201clogical atomism\u201d and the later Wittgenstein\u2019s\n\u201cpractical holism,\u201d tagging the middle Wittgenstein as\n\u201clogical holism.\u201d Between logical atomism and practical\nholism seems to lie a drastic divide, but seeing logical holism as\nbridging the divide gives us the perception \u2013 and understanding\n\u2013 of a natural development between them. As spelled out by Mauro\nEngelmann (2013), this development can then also encompass all the\nabove elements in a comprehensive transition gesturing towards an\n\u201canthropological\u201d view.\n",
