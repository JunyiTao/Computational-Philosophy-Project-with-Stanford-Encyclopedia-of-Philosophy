    "main_text": "The Nature of the Identity Theory\n2. The Nature of the Identity Theory\n\n\nPlace spoke of constitution rather than of identity. One of his\nexamples is \u2018This table is an old packing case\u2019. Another is\n\u2018lightning is an electric discharge\u2019. Indeed this latter\nwas foreshadowed by Place in his earlier paper \u2018The Concept of\nHeed\u2019 (Place 1954), in which he took issue with Ryle's\nbehaviourism as it applied to concepts of consciousness, sensation and\nimagery. Place remarked (p. 255) \nThe logical objections which might be raised to the\nstatement \u2018consciousness is a process in the brain\u2019 are no\ngreater than the logical objections which might be raised to the\nstatement \u2018lightning is a motion of electric\ncharges\u2019.\n\n\nIt should be noticed that Place was using the word\n\u2018logical\u2019 in the way that it was used at Oxford at the\ntime, not in the way that it is normally used now. One objection was\nthat \u2018sensation\u2019 does not mean the same as \u2018brain\nprocess\u2019. Place's reply was to point out that \u2018this\ntable\u2019 does not mean the same as \u2018this old packing\ncase\u2019 and \u2018lightning\u2019 does not mean the same as\n\u2018motion of electric charges\u2019. We find out whether this is a\ntable in a different way from the way in which we find out that it is\nan old packing case. We find out whether a thing is lightning by\nlooking and that it is a motion of electric charges by theory and\nexperiment. This does not prevent the table being identical to the old\npacking case and the perceived lightning being nothing other than an\nelectric discharge. Feigl and Smart put the matter more in terms of the\ndistinction between meaning and reference. \u2018Sensation\u2019 and\n\u2018brain process\u2019 may differ in meaning and yet have the same\nreference. \u2018Very bright planet seen in the morning\u2019 and\n\u2018very bright planet seen in the evening\u2019 both refer to the\nsame entity Venus. (Of course these expressions could be\nconstrued as referring to different things, different sequences of\ntemporal stages of Venus, but not necessarily or most naturally so.) \n\n\nThere did seem to be a tendency among philosophers to have thought\nthat identity statements needed to be necessary and a priori truths.\nHowever identity theorists have treated \u2018sensations are brain\nprocesses\u2019 as contingent. We had to find out that the\nidentity holds. Aristotle, after all, thought that the brain was for\ncooling the blood. Descartes thought that consciousness is\nimmaterial.\n\n\nIt was sometimes objected that sensation statements are incorrigible\nwhereas statements about brains are corrigible. The inference was made\nthat there must be something different about sensations. Ryle and in\neffect Wittgenstein toyed with the attractive but quite implausible\nnotion that ostensible reports of immediate experience are not really\nreports but are \u2018avowals\u2019, as if my report that I have\ntoothache is just a sophisticated sort of wince. Place, influenced by\nMartin, was able to explain the relative incorrigibility of sensation\nstatements by their low claims: \u2018I see a bent oar\u2019 makes a\nbigger claim than \u2018It looks to me that there is a bent\noar\u2019. Nevertheless my sensation and my putative awareness of the\nsensation are distinct existences and so, by Hume's principle, it must\nbe possible for one to occur without the other. One should deny\nanything other than a relative incorrigibility (Place 1989).\n\n\nAs remarked above, Place preferred to express the theory by the\nnotion of constitution, whereas Smart preferred to make prominent the\nnotion of identity as it occurs in the axioms of identity in logic. So\nSmart had to say that if sensation X is identical to brain process Y\nthen if Y is between my ears and is straight or circular (absurdly to\noversimplify) then the sensation X is between my ears and is straight\nor circular. Of course it is not presented to us as such in experience.\nPerhaps only the neuroscientist could know that it is straight or\ncircular. The professor of anatomy might be identical with the dean of\nthe medical school. A visitor might know that the professor hiccups in\nlectures but not know that the dean hiccups in lectures.\n",
