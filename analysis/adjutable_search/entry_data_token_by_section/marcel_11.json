Creative Fidelity\n\nThe discussion of \u201ccreative fidelity\u201d is an excellent\nplace to find a unification, or at least a conjunction, of the various\nthemes and ideas in Marcel\u2019s non-systematic thought. Ontological\nexigence, being, mystery, second reflection, and\ndisponibilit\u00e9 all inform the discussion of creative\nfidelity, which in turn attempts to illustrate how we can experience\nthese mysterious realities in more or less concrete terms.\n\nThe \u201cproblem\u201d posed by fidelity is that of constancy.\nHowever, fidelity\u2014a belief in someone\u2014requires presence in\naddition to constancy over time, and presence implies an affective\nelement. Mere constancy over time is not enough because \u201ca\nfulfillment of on obligation contre-coeur is devoid of love\nand cannot be identified with fidelity\u201d (Marcel 1964, xxii).\nThus, the question is posed as follows. How are we able to remain\ndisponible over time? How can we provide a guarantee of our\n\u201cbelief in\u201d someone? Perhaps the best way to address this\ncomplex idea is to address its constituent parts: the problem posed by\nfidelity and the answer given by creativity.\n\nThe extension of credit to another is a commitment, an act whereby I\ncommit myself and place myself at the disposal of the other. In\nextending credit to the other I am also placing my trust in her,\nimplicitly hoping that she proves worthy of the credit I extend to\nher. However, we sometimes misjudge others in thinking too highly of\nthem and at other times misjudge by underestimation. Recalling that\nthere is an affective element of spontaneity involved in\ndisponibilit\u00e9, how can I assure that I will remain\nfaithful to my present belief in the other? Like the question of\nconviction over time, my present fidelity to another can be questioned\nin terms of its durability. Though I presently feel inclined to credit\nthe other, to put myself at her disposal, how can I assure that this\nfeeling will not change tomorrow, next month, or next year?\nFurthermore, because I have given myself to this other person, placed\nmyself at her disposal, when she falls short of my hopes for\nher\u2014hopes implicit in my extension of credit to her\u2014I am\nwounded.\n\nHowever, the \u201cfailure\u201d of the other to conform to my hopes\nis not necessarily the fault of the other. My disappointment or injury\nis frequently the result of my having assigned some definite,\ndeterminate quality to the other person or defined her in terms of\ncharacteristics that, it turns out, she does not possess. However, by\nwhat right do I assign this characteristic to her, and by what right\ndo I judge her to be wanting? Such a judgment drastically\noversteps\u2014or perhaps falls short of\u2014the bounds of\ndisponibilit\u00e9. In doing so, it demonstrates clearly\nthat I, from the outset, was engaged in a relationship to my idea\nof the other\u2014which has proved to be wrong\u2014rather than\nwith the other herself. That is to say that this encounter\nwas not with the other, but with myself. If I am injured by the\nfailure of the other to conform to an idea that I had of her, this is\nnot indicative of a defect in the other; it is the result of my\ninappropriate attempt to determine her by insisting that she conform\nto my idea. When I begin to doubt my commitment to another person, the\nvulnerability of my \u201cbelief in X\u201d to these doubts\nis directly proportional to the residue of opinion still in it (Marcel\n1964, p. 136).\n\nNevertheless, practically speaking, there are innumerable times when\nmy hopes for the other are not in fact met, when my extension of\ncredit to the other\u2014which is nothing less then the disposability\nof myself\u2014results only in a demand for \u201cmore\u201d by the\nother. Such situations invariably tempt me to reevaluate the credit I\nhave put at the disposal of the other and to reassert the question of\ndurability concerning the affective element of my availability to the\nother. Thus, again, the mystery of fidelity is also the question of\ncommitment, of commitment over time\n\n\u201cHow can I test the initial assurance that is somehow the ground\nof my fidelity? \u2026this appears to lead to a vicious circle. In\nprinciple, to commit myself I must know myself, but the fact is I\nreally only know myself when I have committed myself\u201d (Marcel\n1964, p. 163). However, what appears to be a vicious circle from an\nexternal point of view is experienced from within, by the person who\nis disponible, as a growth and an ascending. Reflection\nqua primary reflection attempts to make the experience of\ncommitment understandable in general terms that would be applicable to\nanyone, but this can only subvert and destroy the reality of\ncommitment, which is essentially personal and therefore, accessible\nonly to secondary reflection.\n\nReturning to the question of durability over time, Marcel insists\nthat, if there is a possible \u201cassurance\u201d of fidelity, it\nis because \u201cdisposability and creativity are related\nideas\u201d (Marcel 1964, p. 53). To be disposable is to believe in\nthe other, to place myself at her disposal and to maintain the\nopenness of disponibilit\u00e9. \u201cCreative\nfidelity\u201d consists in actively maintaining ourselves in a state\nof openness and permeability, in willing ourselves to remain\nopen to the other and open to the influx of the presence of the\nother.\n\nThe fact is that when I commit myself, I grant in principle that the\ncommitment will not again be put into question. And it is clear that\nthis active volition not to question something again, intervenes as an\nessential element in the determination of what in fact will be the\ncase\u2026it bids me to invent a certain modus\nvivendi\u2026it is a rudimentary form of creative fidelity.\n(Marcel 1964, p. 162)\n\n\nThe truest fidelity is creative, that is, a fidelity that\ncreates the self in order to meet the demands of fidelity.\nSuch fidelity interprets the vicissitudes of \u201cbelief\nin\u2026\u201d as a temptation to infidelity and sees them in terms\nof a test of the self rather than in terms of a betrayal by the\nother\u2014if fidelity fails, it is my failure rather than the\nfailure of the other.\n\nHowever, this merely puts off the question of durability over time.\nWhere does one find the strength to continue to create oneself and\nmeet the demands of fidelity? The fact is that, on the hither side of\nthe ontological affirmation\u2014and the attendant appeal of\nHope\u2014fidelity is always open to doubt. I can always call into\nquestion the reality of the bond that links me to another person,\nalways begin to doubt the presence of the person to whom I am\nfaithful, substituting for her presence an idea of my own making. On\nthe other hand, the more disposed I am toward the ontological\naffirmation, to the affirmation of Being, the more I am inclined to\nsee the failure of fidelity as my failure, resulting from my\ninsufficiency rather than that of the other.\n\nHence the ground of fidelity that necessarily seems precarious to us\nas soon as we commit ourselves to another who is unknown, seems on the\nother hand unshakable when it is based not, to be sure, on a distinct\napprehension of God as someone other, but on a certain appeal\ndelivered for the depths of my own insufficiency ad summam\naltitudinem\u2026 This appeal presupposes a radical humility in\nthe subject. (Marcel 1964, p. 167)\n\n\nThus, creative fidelity invariably touches upon hope. The only way in\nwhich an unbounded commitment on the part of the subject is\nconceivable is if it draws strength from something more than itself,\nfrom an appeal to something greater, something transcendent\u2014and\nthis appeal is hope. Can hope provide us with a foundation that allows\nhumans\u2014who are radically contingent, frequently fickle, and\ngenerally weak\u2014to make a commitment that is unconditional?\nMarcel acknowledges, \u201cPerhaps it should further be said that in\nfact fidelity can never be unconditional, except where it is Faith,\nbut we must add, however, that it aspires to unconditionality\u201d\n(Marcel 1962a, p. 133).\n",
