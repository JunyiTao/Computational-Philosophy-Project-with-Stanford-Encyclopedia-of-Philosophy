Theological Fatalism: Pike\u2019s argument and God\u2019s omniscience\n\nA problem which has been much discussed by philosophers, at least\nsince the time of Augustine (354\u2013430), is whether divine\nomniscience is compatible with free will, and in particular with our\nhaving the power to do other than we do.\n\nOne way of arguing for this incompatibility is due to Pike (Pike\n1965).\n\n\nLet us suppose that being omniscient involves being infallible, and\nbelieving that p if and only if it is true that\np.\n\nLet us also suppose that God existed in 1900, and that omniscience is\npart of his essence.\n\nNow, suppose that Jones mowed his lawn on 1/1/2000.\n\nThen God believed in 1900 that Jones would mow his lawn on\n1/1/2000.\n\nDid Jones have the power to refrain from mowing his lawn?\n\nNo. Because that would mean either (1) that he had the power to do\nsomething which would have brought it about that God had a false\nbelief in 1900, or (2) that he had the power to do something which\nwould have brought it about that God did not believe in 1900 that\nJones would mow his lawn on 1/1/2000, or (3) that he had the power to\ndo something which would have brought it about that God did not exist\nin 1900. And each of these alternatives is impossible.\n\n\nAre there any objections to this argument?\n\nNaturally it would be possible to object to some of the suppositions\nabout the existence and nature of God. I will return to them.\n\nFirst we should notice that the argument depends on a certain\nprinciple about power which is very similar to the plausible amended\nversion of Taylor\u2019s presupposition 5:\n\nIf it is in S\u2019s power to do something which would bring\nit about that p, and p entails q, and\nq is false, then it is in S\u2019s power to do\nsomething which would bring it about that q .\n\n\nThis seems plausible. One might, though, prefer to avoid all mention\nof bringing about, and to rephrase the argument in terms of\ncounterfactuals. So, one would say instead, \u201c\u2026that would\nmean either (1) that he had the power so to act that God would have\nhad a false belief in 1900, or \u2026\u201d (Fischer 1989,\n8\u201311) However, the argument seems at least as plausible when\nrephrased in this way.\n\nSince, given Pike\u2019s assumptions about the existence and nature of\nGod, it would have been impossible for Jones to act in such a way\nthat God would have had a false belief or would not have existed, we\ncan confine our attention to the question of whether he had the power\nso to act that God would not have believed in 1900 that he would mow\nthe lawn on 1/1/2000.\n\nPlantinga (1974a, Part 1, b) claims that the argument\nfails to show that Jones did not have the power to refrain from\nmowing since there is a possible world in which he refrained from\nmowing, and so a possible world in which he acted in such a way\nthat God would not have believed that he would mow. Pike\nreplies (Pike 1977) that the fact that there is such a\npossible world is not enough to show that Jones had the power to\nrefrain; he cites the fact that there is a possible world in which he\njumps ten feet, but says that that does not mean that he has the power\nto jump ten feet.\n\nIt seems that, if Plantinga were right, there would be a ready answer\nto the claim that powerlessness to do anything other than what we\nactually do follows from causal determnism; in particular to the\nclaim that, if Jones\u2019s mowing were causally determined by\ncircumstances, natural or supernatural, prior to his birth, he would\nnot have the power to refrain. The answer would be that there was a\npossible world in which the circumstances before his birth were such\nas not to prevent Jones from mowing.\n\nHowever, it is beyond the scope of this entry to discuss the question\nof whether the power to do anything other than what we actually do is\ncompatible with causal determinism. Let us, therefore, consider\nwhether there is any other reason for thinking that Jones might\nhave had the power to act in such a way that God would not have\nbelieved that he would mow the lawn on 1/1/2000.\n",
