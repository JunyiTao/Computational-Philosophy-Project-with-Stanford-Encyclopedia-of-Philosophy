    "main_text": "Composition is not Identity\n9. Rethinking Parthood\n\nAfter concluding that all of these kinds of solutions face serious\ndifficulties, Hudson (2001: Chapter 2) outlines a new solution, one\nwhich rejects so many of the presuppositions of the puzzle that it is\nbest to count him as rejecting the reasoning, rather than rejecting\nany particular premise. (Hudson is somewhat tentative about\nendorsing this view, as opposed to merely endorsing the claim\nthat it looks better than its many rivals, but for expository purposes\nlet us refer to it here as his view.) To see the motivation behind\nHudson\u2019s approach, consider a slightly different case, a variant\nof one discussed in Wiggins 1968. Tibbles is born at midnight Sunday,\nreplete with a splendid tail, called Tail. An unfortunate accident\ninvolving a guillotine sees Tibbles lose his tail at midday Monday,\nthough the tail is preserved for posterity. Then midnight Monday,\nTibbles dies. Now consider the timeless question, \u201cIs Tail part\nof Tibbles?\u201d Intuitively, we want to say the question is\nunderspecified. Outside of Monday, the question does not arise, for\nTibbles does not exist. Before midday Monday, the answer is\n\u201cYes\u201d, and after midday the answer is \u201cNo\u201d.\nThis suggests that there is really no proposition that Tail is part of\nTibbles. There is a proposition that Tail is part of Tibbles on Monday\nmorning (that\u2019s true) and that Tail is part of Tibbles on Monday\nafternoon (that\u2019s false), but no proposition involving just the\nparthood relation and two objects. Parthood is a three-place relation\nbetween two objects and a time, not a two-place relation between two\nobjects.\n\nHudson suggests that this line of reasoning is potentially on the\nright track, but that the conclusion is not quite right. Parthood is a\nthree-place relation, but the third place is not filled by a time, but\nby a region of space-time. To a crude approximation, x is\npart of y at s is true if (as we\u2019d normally\nsay) x is a part of y and s is a region of\nspace-time containing no region not occupied by y and all\nregions occupied by x. But this should be taken as a\nheuristic guide only, not as a reductive definition, since parthood is\nreally a three-place relation, so the crude approximation does not\neven express a proposition according to Hudson.\n\nTo see how this applies to the Problem of the Many, let\u2019s\nsimplify the case a little bit so there are only two water droplets,\nw1 and w2, that are neither\ndeterminately part of the cloud nor determinately not a part of it. As\nwell there is the core of the cloud, call it a. On an\northodox theory, there are four proto-clouds here, a,\na + w1, a +\nw2 and a + w1 +\nw 2. On Hudson\u2019s theory the largest and the\nsmallest proto-clouds still exist, but in the middle there is a quite\ndifferent kind of object, which we\u2019ll call c. Let\nr1 be the region occupied by a and\nw1, and r2 the region occupied\nby a and w2. Then the following claims\nare all true according to Hudson:\n\nc exactly occupies r1;\nc exactly occupies r2;\nc does not occupy the region consisting of the union of\nr1 and r2;\nc has w1 as a part at\nr1, but not at r2;\nc has w2 as a part at\nr2, but not at r1;\nc has no parts at the region consisting of the union of\nr1 and r2.\n\n\nHudson defines \u201cx exactly occupies s\u201d as\nfollows:\n\nx has a part at s,\nthere is no region of space-time, s*, such that\ns* has s as a subregion, while x has a part\nat s*, and\nfor every subregion of s, s\u2032, x\nhas a part at s\u2032. (Hudson 2001: 63)\n\n\nAt first, it might look like not much has been accomplished here. All\nthat we did was turn a Problem of 4 clouds into a Problem of 3 clouds,\nreplacing the fusions a + w1 and\na + w2 with the new, and oddly behaved,\nc. But that is to overlook a rather important feature of the\nremaining proto-clouds. The three remaining proto-clouds can be\nstrictly ordered by the \u2018part of\u2019 relation. This was not\npreviously possible, since neither a + w1\nnor a + w2 were part of the other. If we\nadopt the principle that \u2018cloud\u2019 is a maximal predicate,\nso no cloud can be a proper part of another cloud, we now get the\nconclusion that exactly one of the proto-clouds is a cloud, as\ndesired.\n\nThis is a quite ingenious approach, and it deserves some attention in\nthe future literature. It is hard to say what will emerge as the main\ncosts and benefits of the view in advance of that literature, but the\nfollowing two points seem worthy of attention. First, if we are\nallowed to appeal to the principle that no cloud is a proper part of\nanother, why not appeal to the principle that no two clouds massively\noverlap, and get from 4 proto-clouds to one actual cloud that way?\nSecondly, why don\u2019t we have an object that is just like the old\na + w1, that is, an object that has\nw1 as a part at r1, and does\nnot have w2 (or anything else) as a part at\nr2? If we get it back, as well as a +\nw2, then all of Hudson\u2019s tinkering with\nmereology will just have converted a problem of 4 clouds into a\nproblem of 5 clouds.\n\nNeither of these points should be taken to be conclusive refutations.\nAs things stand now, Hudson\u2019s solution joins the ranks of the\nmany and varied proposed solutions to the Problem of the Many. For\nsuch a young problem, the variety of these solutions is rather\nimpressive. Whether the next few years will see these ranks whittled\ndown by refutation, or swelled by imaginative theorising, remains to\nbe seen.\n",
