    "main_text": "Atemporal Eternity\n5. Atemporal Eternity\n\nA very different approach to explaining God\u2019s knowledge of the\ncontingent future involves suggesting that God exists outside of time\naltogether. This would mean that God does not foreknow the future,\nstrictly speaking, since foreknowledge is knowledge of an event that\nis possessed at a moment in time that occurs earlier than the moment\nin time at which the foreknown event occurs. Instead, the idea is that\nGod knows all events from the perspective of timeless eternity. (For\nfurther elaboration and defense of this view, see Stump and Kretzmann\n1987, Helm 1988, and Leftow 1991.) Many theists have adopted this view\nthroughout the centuries, including the highly influential medieval\ntheologian\n St. Thomas Aquinas\n (1225\u20131274). One of the earliest Christian theologians to\ndefend this approach was Boethius (480\u2013524 C.E.), who wrote in\nThe Consolation of Philosophy that \u201c[Since] God has a\ncondition of ever-present eternity, His knowledge, which passes over\nevery change of time, embracing infinite lengths of past and future,\nviews in its own direct comprehension everything as though it were\ntaking place in the present\u201d (Boethius Consolation,\n117).\n\nSome philosophers have objected to this way of explaining God\u2019s\nknowledge because they think that it represents non-biblical picture\nof God derived largely from Greek philosophical influences (see\nWolterstorff 1982, for example). But it does suggest an interesting\napproach to the problem of prophecy. In terms of our example, the\ndefender of God\u2019s atemporal eternity would say that God knows\nfrom the perspective of eternity that Peter will deny Jesus at a\ncertain time, and on this basis, Jesus prophecies in time that the\nevent in question will occur. \n\nOne worry about this approach is that once Jesus prophecies at a\nparticular time that Peter will deny him, God\u2019s atemporally\neternal knowledge seems to be \u201cintroduced\u201d into the past\n(as David Widerker says in Widerker 1991), and the advantages of the\natemporal eternity view seem to disappear. For we are still left with\ntrying to explain how Peter\u2019s denial could be contingent, given\nthat the prophecy has already occurred. It seems that either\nPeter\u2019s denial is not free or the past can be changed somehow.\n\n\nEleonore Stump and Norman Kretzmann, probably the most prominent\nadvocates of the atemporal eternity view, have defended the atemporal\neternity approach to prophecy against Widerker\u2019s objection (see\nStump and Kretzmann 1991). They point out that most prophecies are\nconditional or vague, so that they leave \u201croom\u201d for\ndifferent ways in which they might be fulfilled (400\u2013401). If a\nprophecy were to be very specific, then it might actually render the\naction in question inevitable, they admit, but they also insist that\nrendering an action inevitable is not the same as making it unfree.\nThis is because they distinguish freedom of action from freedom of\nwill, and argue that \u201cit is possible for an action to be\ninevitable and yet a free action\u201d (403), as (for instance) when\n\u201cthe agent himself has a powerful desire to do the action, his\nwill is not causally determined by anything external to him or by\npathological factors within him, and the inaccessible alternatives to\nhis inevitable action are alternatives the agent has no desire to do\nor even some desire not to do\u201d (403). Trying to resolve the\ndispute between Widerker and Stump and Kretzmann would go beyond the\nscope of this article, though, so instead we will turn to the final\nremaining solution that has been proposed for the problem of prophecy.\n\n",
