    "main_text": "Mathematical Issues || The Appearance of Paradox\n2.1 The Appearance of Paradox\n\n\nThere are two ways to approach the first question. On the one hand,\nwe could start with the formula \u03a9(x), and give\nthis formula what we might call its \u201cordinary English\u201d\ninterpretation. This is the interpretation which lets\n\u201c\u2208\u201d refer to the real set-theoretic membership\nrelation, which lets \u201c\u2200\u201d and \u201c\u2203\u201d\nrange over the whole (real) set-theoretic universe, and which\ninterprets \u201c=\u201d and the propositional connectives in the\nusual\n manner.[14]\nThen for any set m, \u03a9(m) will come out\ntrue if and only if m is\n uncountable.[15]\n This shows that there is\nat least one interpretation of \u03a9(x) under which\nthis formula really does capture\u2014at least from an extensional\nperspective\u2014the ordinary mathematical notion of uncountability.\nSo, there's at least one interpretation under which\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\n really does say that m\u02c6\nis uncountable.\n\n\nOn the other hand, we could start, not with the formula\n\u03a9(x), but with the ordinary English sentence\n\u201cx is uncountable.\u201d If asked what this sentence\nmeans, a set theorist will say something about the lack of a bijection\nbetween x and the natural\n numbers.[16]\n If asked about the phrase \u201cis a\nbijection,\u201d she will go on to talk about collections of ordered\npairs satisfying certain nice properties, and if asked about the term\n\u201cordered pair,\u201d she will say something about the ways one\ncan identify ordered pairs with particular sets. If she takes this\nprocess far enough\u2014and if she saves herself some time by using\nsymbols like \u00ac and \u2203y as abbreviations for\n\u201cnot\u201d and \u201cthere exists a set y such\nthat\u201d\u2014then she will eventually obtain a detailed\nexplication of \u201cx is uncountable\u201d which looks just\nlike the formula \u03a9(x). That is, if we simply\ncompare the syntax of her explication of \u201cx is\nuncountable\u201d with the syntax of \u03a9(x), then\nwe will find that these two expressions contain exactly the same\nsymbols in exactly the same\n order.[17]\n Once again, therefore, we find that there's a\nreal, if a somewhat superficial, similarity between\n\u03a9(x) and \u201cx is\nuncountable\u201d\u2014a similarity which remains even after we stop\nusing \u201cx is uncountable\u201d as a straightforward\nabbreviation for \u03a9(x), and a similarity which\nexplains why even a perspicuously formulated version of Skolem's\nParadox may continue to look somewhat puzzling.\n\n\nThese, then, are two ways of thinking about the relationship between\n\u03a9(x) and \u201cx is\nuncountable.\u201d Together they explain why it's so natural for\nmathematicians to use \u201cx is uncountable\u201d as an\nabbreviation for \u03a9(x) and (so) why someone might\nbe inclined to think that the fact that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\n should\nentail that m\u02c6 is\n uncountable. They also bring us back to\nour second question: why doesn't the fact that\nM\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\n really entail that\n m\u02c6 is uncountable.\n",
